## Definition

Let $\cdot\colon M \times M\to M$ be a binary operation, i.e. $(M,\cdot)$ is a [[magma]]. We say that the operation $\cdot$ is

* __left self-distributive__ if for all $x,y,z\in M$, $x\cdot(y\cdot z) = (x\cdot y)\cdot (x\cdot z)$;
* __right self-distributive__ if for all $x,y,z\in M$, $(y\cdot z)\cdot x = (y\cdot x)\cdot (z\cdot x)$.


## Examples

The binary operation in any [[semilattice]] is self-distributive on both sides, following from associativity, commutativity, and idempotence.

The operations in a [[rack]] are self-distributive on the side on which they act.
