## Idea

The concept of [[Chern classes]] of [[complex vector bundles]] as [[universal characteristic classes]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] generalized to any [[complex oriented cohomology|complex oriented]] [[generalized cohomology theory]]: the _Conner-Floyd Chern classes_ ([Conner-Floyd 66](#ConnerFloyd66), [Adams 74](#Adams74)), review includes ([Kochmann 96, section 4.3](#Kochmann96), [Lurie 10, lectures 4 and 5](#Lurie10)):

for $E$ a [[generalized cohomology theory]], the analog of the [[first Chern class]] in $E$-cohomology is what appears in the very definition of [[complex oriented cohomology]]. The higher generalized Chern classes are induced from this by the [[splitting principle]]. See at _[complex oriented cohomology -- the cohomology ring of BU(n)](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#TheCohomologyRingOfBUn)_.

The generalized Chern classes serve as the generalized [[Thom classes]] that make every [[complex vector bundle]] have [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] with respect to any [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] ([Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10)).
