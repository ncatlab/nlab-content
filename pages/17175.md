## Idea

The concept of [[Chern classes]] of [[complex vector bundles]] as [[universal characteristic classes]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] generalized to any [[complex oriented cohomology|complex oriented]] [[generalized cohomology theory]]: the _Conner-Floyd Chern classes_ ([Conner-Floyd 66](#ConnerFloyd66), [Adams 74](#Adams74)), review includes ([Kochmann 96, section 4.3](#Kochmann96), [Lurie 10, lectures 4 and 5](#Lurie10)):

for $E$ a [[generalized cohomology theory]], the analog of the [[first Chern class]] in $E$-cohomology is what appears in the very definition of [[complex oriented cohomology]]. The higher generalized Chern classes are induced from this by the [[splitting principle]]. See at _[complex oriented cohomology -- the cohomology ring of BU(n)](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#TheCohomologyRingOfBUn)_.

The generalized Chern classes serve as the generalized [[Thom classes]] that make every [[complex vector bundle]] have [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] with respect to any [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] ([Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10)).

###### Proposition

Given a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ with complex orientation $c_1^E$, then the $E$-[[generalized cohomology]] of the [[classifying space]] $B U(n)$ is freely generated over the [[graded commutative ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$ ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#HomotopyGroupsOfHomotopyCommutativeRingSpectrum)) by classes $c_k^E$ for $0 \leq \leq n$ of degree $2k$, these are called the **[[Conner-Floyd-Chern classes]]**

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(n))
    \;\simeq\;
  \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c_1^E, c_2^E, \cdots, c_n^E ] ]
  \,.
$$

Moreover, pullback along the canonical inclusion $B U(n) \to B U(n+1)$ is the identity on $c_k^E$ for $k \leq n$ and sends $c_{n+1}^E$ to zero.

For $E = $ [[HA|HZ]] this reduces to the standard [[Chern classes]].
