## Idea

The concept of [[Chern classes]] of [[complex vector bundles]] as [[universal characteristic classes]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] generalized to any [[complex oriented cohomology|complex oriented]] [[generalized cohomology theory]] ([Adams 74](#Adams74), [Lurie 10](#Lurie10)):

for $E$ a [[generalized cohomology theory]], the analog of the [[first Chern class]] in $E$-cohomology is what appears in the very definition of [[complex oriented cohomology]]. The higher generalized Chern classes are induced from this by the [[splitting principle]].

The generalized Chern classes serve as the generalized [[Thom classes]] that make every [[complex vector bundle]] have [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] with respect to any [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] ([Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10)).
