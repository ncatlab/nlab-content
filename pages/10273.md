## Introduction and survey

These notes concern the generalization of the notion of _[[gerbes]]_, of _[[principal 2-bundles]] with [[principal 2-connections]]_ and generally of _[[principal ∞-bundles]] with [[principal ∞-connection]]_ from [[higher differential geometry]] modeled on [[smooth manifolds]] to [[higher geometry|higher]] _[[supergeometry]]_ modeled on [[supermanifolds]].

A key motivation for this comes from applications to [[string theory]] and the induced [[higher geometry]]-analog of traditional [[spin geometry]] called _[[string geometry]]_:

Since early observations in the 1980s ([Gawędzki 87](#Gawedzki87)) and then more prominently since ([Freed-Witten 99](FreedWitten99), [Carey-Johnson-Murray 02](#CareyJohnsonMurray02))), it is known that the [[B-field]] in [[string theory]] is mathematically a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] and that the _[[WZW term]]_ in the [[action functional]] of the 2-dimensional [[string]] [[sigma-model]] with such a [[background gauge field]] is the [[surface holonomy]] of this 2-connection, in higher analogy of how the gauge [[interaction]] term of the [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetically]] [[charged particle]] is the line [[holonomy]] of a [[circle bundle with connection]] over the [[worldline]] of the [[particle]]. 

While this is well-explored by now, it has in fact almost exclusively been applied to the [[bosonic string]], or else to the bosonic sector of the [[superstring]]. Notably the [[anomaly cancellation]] between the contributions of the [[B-field]] and of the [[fermions]] (on the [[string]]'s [[worldsheet]] and/or in [[spacetime]]) is typically considered in two independent steps: a computation in [[index theory]] gives the fermioninc anomaly incarnated as a [[Pfaffian line bundle]] and then the contribution of the [[B-field]] to the anomaly is adjusted such as to cancel the class of this anomaly bundle. Notable examples of this are the [[Freed-Witten-Kapustin anomaly]] in [[type II string theory]] (incarnated as [[spin^c structure]] serving as [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in [[complex K-theory]]) and the [[Green-Schwarz anomaly]] in [[heterotic string theory]] (incarnated as [[string^c structure]] serving as [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in [[tmf]]-[[cohomology theory]]).

However, since in [[string theory]] all the [[fermion|fermionic]] contributions are connected by ([[supergravity|local]]!) [[supersymmetry]] to the bosonic contributions, it is certainly to be expected than on a more fundamental level there are not two independent contributions -- one in [[spin geometry]] (the [[fermions]]) and one [[higher differential geometry]] (the [[B-field]]) -- that happen to cancel each other, but that instead the [[field (physics)|fields]] arrange into one single structure in the _[[higher supergeometry]]_.

By general principles of [[higher geometry]] it is clear what [[higher supergeometry]] is to be: the theory of [[∞-stacks]] over a [[site]] of [[supermanifolds]], hence of _[[smooth super ∞-groupoids]]_. The general notions of [[principal ∞-bundles]] and of [[principal ∞-connections]] apply to this ([[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive]]) [[(∞,1)-topos]] as to any other and hence in principle provide all the relevant structure.

It remains to work out more examples and applications. A good testing ground is the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation of [[smooth super ∞-groupoids]] by their _[[super L-∞ algebras]]_. It turns out ([SSS 09](#SSS09)) that that these have _implicitly_ been recognized and used in the study of higher [[supergravity]] for a long time, starting with ([D'Auria-Fré 80](#DAuriaFre80)), namely in their dual dually incarnation via their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]]. In ([Nieuwenhuizen 83](#Nieuwenhuizen83)) these super-dg-algebras have been called "free differential algebras", abbreviated "FDA", referring to the fact that their underlying graded superalgebra is free on a [[super vector space]], hence is a super-[[Grassmann algebra]]. Since the [[differential]] on these [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] is crucially _not_ [[free construction|free]], in general, this is an unfortunate misnomer, but it did stick and is used ever since in the [[supergravity]] literature, see the references at _[[D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity]]_ and at _[[Green-Schwarz action functional]]_.

If however one does make the [[homotopy theory of L-∞ algebras]] explicit that is hidden in the "FDA"-formulation of [[supergravity]], then one sees that a large part of the literature has secretyl been describing the infinitesimal approximation to [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory|higher WZW terms]] all along ([FSS 13b](#FSS13b)), namely in form of the [[Green-Schwarz action functionals]] for [[sigma-models]] of higher-dimensional [[branes]] propagating in a [[super spacetime]] [[target space]]. By ([FSS 13b, last section](#FSS13b)), each of these [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] action functionals formulated (implicitly) in terms of [[super L-∞ algebra|super L-∞ algebraic data]] [[Lie integration|Lie integrates]] to a genuine ([[non-perturbative field theory|non-perturbative]]) [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory|∞-WZW model]] in [[higher supergeometry]]. 

The present notes are aimed at spelling out this example of classes of "super gerbes", but for the most part they apply more generally and only take their motivation from this example.

$\,$

We start with traditional basics, first introducing [[superpoints]] and [[supermanifolds]], then recalling the [[spin group]] and the classification of its [[spin representations]], and then combining both to build $N$-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] as [[coset spaces]] of the [[super Poincaré group]] of $N$ [[supersymmetries]].

Then we introduce [[higher supergeometry]] in terms of [[super stacks]]/[[smooth super ∞-groupoids]] and finally discuss how all the exceptional [[L-∞ cocycles]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] and its higher [[L-∞ extensions]] yield the [[Green-Schwarz sigma models]] of the [[brane scan]] of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]], and in fact the whole [[schreiber:The brane bouquet|brane bouquet]] of branes with "tensor multiplet" fields, such as the [[D-branes]] and notably the [[M5-brane]].
