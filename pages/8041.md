
Given [[sets]] $A$ and $B$ and a [[function]] $f\colon A \to B$, the __inverse function__ of $f$ (if it exists) if the function $f^{-1}\colon B \to A$ such that both [[composite function]]s $f \circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \circ f$ are [[identity functions]].  Note that $f$ has an inverse function if and only if $f$ is a [[bijection]], in which case this inverse function is unique.

Inverse functions are [[inverse morphisms]] in the category [[Set]] of sets.

More generally, in any [[concrete category]], the inverse of any [[isomorphism]] is given by the inverse of the corresponding function between [[underlying sets]].
