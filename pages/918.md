## Definition

A [[function]] $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is __surjective__ if, given any element $y$ of $B$, $y = f(x)$ for some $x$.  A surjective function is also called __onto__ or a __surjection__; it is the same as an [[epimorphism]] in [[Set|the category of sets]].

A _[[bijection]]_ is a function that is both [[surjection|surjective]] and [[injection|injective]].

The [[axiom of choice]] states precisely that every surjection in the category of sets has a [[section]].  Some authors who doubt the axiom of choice use the term 'onto' for a surjection as defined above and reserve 'surjective' for the stronger notion of a function with a section (a [[split epimorphism]]).
