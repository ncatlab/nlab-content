## Idea

Symmetric spectra are one version of [[highly structured spectra]] that support a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]. A _symmetric spectrum_ is a sequence of [[topological spaces]]/[[simplicial sets]] which are compatibly equipped with an [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]].

The [[category]] of _symmetric spectra_ is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra|of spectra]], with the special property that it implements the [[smash product of spectra]] such as to yield itself a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal model category|monoidal]] [[model category of spectra]]: the _[[model structure on symmetric spectra]]_. This implies in particular that with respect to this [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] an [[E-∞ ring]] is presented simply as a plain [[commutative monoid]] [[internalization|in]] symmetric spectra. This is of course such that truncating down to the [[homotopy category]] yields equivalently the [[stable homotopy category]] with its usual [[smash product of spectra]].


The main technical issue with symmetric spectra is that the naive definition of [[homotopy groups]] for them is not general homotopy correct, one needs to replace by a "semistable symmetric spectrum" first, see [below](#HomotopyGroups). This problem goes away for [[orthogonal spectra]] (these however need to be based on [[topological spaces]] instead of [[simplicial sets]]).

## Definition

A symmetric spectrum is a [[sequential spectrum]] equipped with an [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] on each component space, such that the structure maps [[intertwiner|intertwine]] these actions combined with the canonical permutaion action on the [[n-spheres]]:

###### Definition

A **symmetric spectrum** $X$ in [[sSet]] is

1. a sequence $\{X_n| n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]];

1. a baspoint preserving left [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on $X_n$;

1. a sequence of morphisms of pointed simplicial sets $\sigma_n \colon X_n \wedge S^1 \longrightarrow X_{n+1}$ 

such that

* for all $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[composition|composite]]

  $$
    X_n \wedge S^{k} \stackrel{\sigma_n \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} X_{n+1} \wedge S^{k-1} \stackrel{\sigma_{n+1}\wedge id}{\longrightarrow} \cdots \stackrel{\sigma_{n+k-1}}{\longrightarrow} X_{n+k}
  $$

  [[intertwiner|intertwines]] the $\Sigma_{n+k}$-[[action]].

A [[morphism]] of symmetric spectra $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is

* a sequence of morphisms of pointed simplicial sets $f_n \colon X_n \longrightarrow Y_n$

such that

1. each $f_n$ [[intertwiner|intetwines]] the $\Sigma_n$-[[action]];

1. the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]

   $$
     \array{
        X_n \wedge S^1 &\stackrel{f_n \wedge id}{\longrightarrow}& Y_n \wedge S^1
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^X_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^Y_n}}
        \\
        X_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
     }
     \,.
   $$

## Properties

### Smash product
 {#SmashProduct}

[[smash product of spectra]] modeled on symmetric spectra

e.g. ([Schwede 12, I.3](#Schwede12))

### Homotopy groups
 {#HomotopyGroups}

The main technical issue with symmetric spectra is that the evident definition of [[stable homotopy groups]] of symmetric spectra $X$ as 

$$
  \pi_n(X) = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k \pi_{k+n}(X_k)
$$

does _not_ in general come out in the homotopy correct way; instead one needs to replace by a "semistable symmetric spectrum" first, which however is hard to control ([Schwede 12, chapter I, sections 2 and 6 and 8](#Schwede12)), survey includes ([Malkiewich 14, section 2.3](#Malkiewich14)). 

Among the various (now) common models for [[spectra]], this issue is unique to symmetric spectra, see also the comment in ([Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley 01, p. 3](#MandellMaySchwedeShipley01)).

In particular, this problem goes away for the concept of [[orthogonal spectra]], which otherwise is very similar to that of symmetric spectra and shares most of its advantages (except that it does not admit a version based on [[simplicial sets]]).
