## Idea

A 'PROP' --- an abbreviation of 'products and permutations category' --- is a generalization of an [[operad]] in which one allows multiple inputs as well as multiple outputs. If one thinks of an operad as being something like the data of a [[tree]] then a PROP is something like the data of a [[corolla]], or a trees glued upside-down to another tree along the root.  One can think of PROPs as a variant of [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] suitable for non[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] contexts.  In this respect they are similar to [[operad|operads]].  However, they are more general, because they can be used to describe operations with many outputs as well as many inputs.


## Definitions ##

As there are both [[operads]] and [[colored operads]], there can be PROPs with many colors. We define the many-colored version below.

###### Definition

A **colored PROP** comprises the following data:

* a set of objects $X_0$.
* for two finite lists of objects $\vec{x}=\{x_0,\ldots,x_n\}$ and $\vec{y}=\{y_0,\ldots, y_m\}$, a set of morphisms or "multimorphisms" $Mul(\vec{x},\vec{y})$.
* **vertical composition**, that is, for $\vec{x}$, $\vec{y}$ and $\vec{z}$, a function 
$$
Mul(\vec{x},\vec{y})\times Mul(\vec{y},\vec{z})\to Mul(\vec{x},\vec{z})
$$
 which is suitably unital, associative and equivariant with respect to permutations of the inputs and outputs. 
* **horizontal composition**, that is, for $\vec{x}=\{x_0,\ldots,x_n\}$, $\vec{y}=\{y_0,\ldots,y_m\}$, $\vec{z}=\{z_0,\ldots,z_l\}$ and $\vec{w}=\{w_0,\ldots,w_k\}$, a function 
$$
Mul(\vec{x},\vec{y})\times Mul(\vec{z},\vec{w})\to Mul(\{x_0,\ldots,x_n,z_0,\ldots,z_l\},\{y_0,\ldots,y_m,w_0,\ldots,w_k\})
$$
which is suitably unital, associative and equivariant with respect to permutations of the inputs and outputs.

##Examples##

####One Colored Props####

A one colored PROP is equivalent to the data of a symmetric monoidal category $C$ with one object $\{x\}$. The set of multimorphisms from $n$ copies of $x$ to $m$ copies of $x$ in the PROP is just the set of morphisms $Hom_C(x^{\otimes n},x^{\otimes m})$.


##Algebras of PROPs##

###### Definition

Given a PROP $T$ and a symmetric monoidal category $C$, a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$F : T \to C$$

is called an **algebra** or **model** of $T$ in $C$.  The category of algebras of $T$ in $C$, say $Alg(T,C)$, has

* symmetric monoidal functors $F : T \to C$ as objects,
* [[symmetric monoidal natural transformation|symmetric monoidal natural transformations]] as morphisms.
