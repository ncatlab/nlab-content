Two polygons in the Eucledean plane $P,P'$ have the same area iff they are __scissors congruent__ in the sense that they can be subdivided into _finitely_ many pieces such that each piece of $P$ is congruent to exactly one piece of $P'$. __Hilbert's third problem__ was if the analogue of this elementary fact holds for polyhedra in 3-dimensional space. Dehn solved this problem in terms of Dehn's invariant which, in a modern language, assigns to a polyhedron $P$ an element in $\mathbf{R}\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}} \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$. If both the Dehn's invariant and volume of two (3-dimensional finite) polyhedra in Eucledean space are equal then they are scissors congruent. __Generalized Hilbert's third problem__ is asking for two finite $n$-polytopes in Eucledean, spherical or hyperbolic $n$-space are scissors equivalent in terms of computable invariants. 

The __scissors congruence group__  $\mathcal{P}(X,G)$ where $G$ is a subgroup of the group of isometries of $X$, is the free abelian group on symbols $[P]$, for all polytopes in $X$ modulo the relations

(i) $[P]-[P']-[P'']$ when $P = P'\coprod P''$,

(ii) $[gP]-[P]$.
