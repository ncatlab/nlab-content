Abraham Robinson was a German born mathematician, who studied in Jerusalem, before taking up various positions in France then in Cranfield (the staff college of the RAF in the UK, during the second world war), Israel, Canada and finally in the USA at UCLA and Yale. He is the 'father' of Nonstandard Analysis, the first full formalisation of the intuitive infinitesimal calculus, used historically in mathematics, and still in use in physics.  He died of cancer in 1974.
