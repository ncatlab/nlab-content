A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __irreflexive__ if no element of $A$ is related to itself:
$$ \forall (x: A),\; x \nsim x .$$

What exactly is $\nsim$ here? 

If this was intended to be an *abbreviation* of $\neg\, (x\sim x)$, which is how irreflexive relations are usually presented, in particular in the model theory of graphs, this probably should be spelled out, for clarity.

If this is meant to be *another* relation symbol of its own, this seems betwixt and between, or at least interestingly unusual.

May be missing something obvious, but, in any case, a few clarifying words seem called for.

In the language of the $2$-poset [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __irreflexive__ if it is [[disjoint]] from the [[identity relation]] on $A$:
$$ \id_A \cap R \subseteq \empty .$$
Of course, this containment is in fact an equality.

In [[constructive mathematics]], if $A$ is equipped with a [[tight apartness]] $\#$, we say that $\sim$ is __strongly irrelexive__ if only distinct elements of $A$ are related:
$$ \forall (x: A),\; \forall (y: A),\; x \sim y \;\Rightarrow x \# y .$$
Since $\#$ is irrelexive itself, any strongly irrelexive relation must be irrelexive.  The converse holds using [[excluded middle]], through which every set has a unique tight apartness.
