A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __irreflexive__ if no element of $A$ is related to itself:
$$\forall (x: A),\; x \nsim x$$

In the language of the $2$-poset [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __irreflexive__ if it is disjoint from the identity relation on $A$:
$$\id_A \cap R \subseteq \empty$$
Of course, this containment is in fact an equality.
