## Idea

A _Chern-Simons 2-gerbe_ is a cocycle in degree 4 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that is canonically associated to a $G$-[[principal bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]].

For $G$ a [[Lie group]] and $c : \mathcal{B}G \to K(\mathbb{Z},4)$ a cocycle for a degree 4 [[characteristic class]] in [[integral cohomology]] and $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], [[Chern-Weil theory]] provides a morphism (the refined [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]])

$$
  \hat c : G Bund_\nabla(X) \to H_{diff}^4(X)
$$

from $G$-[[principal bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ to degree 4 [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. The cocycles on the right may be thought of as

* [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]] $\hat c(\nabla)$;

* [[bundle gerbe|bundle 2-gerbe]]s with connection.

By construction, the [[curvature]] 4-form of $\hat c(\nabla)$ is the [[curvature characteristic form]] $\langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla\rangle$ of $\nabla$ and accordingly the 3-form connection on $\hat c(\nabla)$ is locally a [[Chern-Simons form]] $CS(\nabla)$ of $\nabla$.

Accordingly, the [[parallel transport]] induced by $\hat c(\nabla)$ over 3-dimensional manifolds $\phi : \Sigma \to X$ is the [[action functional]] of the [[quantum field theory]] called [[Chern-Simons theory]]. In this form it appears for instance as the [[gauge field]] called the [[supergravity C-field]] in certain [[supergravity]] theories. In particular, if (with due care) one takes $\nabla$ to be the _universal connection on the $G$-[[universal principal bundle]]_ over a smooth version of $B G$, then $\hat c(\nabla)$ is the background [[gauge field]] for bare [[Chern-Simons theory]].

Therefore this structure $\hat c(\nabla)$ has become known as the **Chern-Simons 2-gerbe**  of $\nabla$. We may also think of it as the _Chern-Simons [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]]_ .

At least for simply connected $G$ one may enhance the assignment $\nabla \mapsto \hat c(\nabla)$ to a morphism of [[âˆž-groupoid]]s

$$
  \hat \mathbf{c} : \mathbf{H}_conn(X,\mathbf{B}G)
  \to \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have the [[groupoid]] of smooth $G$-principal bundles with connection on $X$, and on the right the 3-groupoid of circle 3-bundles with connection. The [[homotopy fiber]]s of this morphism over a trivial circle 3-bundle with connection are 3-groupoids whose objects are naturally identified with pairs consisting of a connection $\nabla$ on a $G$-bundle and a _trivialization_ of its corresponding Chern-Simons 3-bundle. This in particular implies a trivialization of the underlying cocycle in degree 4 [[integral cohomology]] and therefore defines a [[string structure]]. One calls these homotopy fibers therefore [[differential string structure]]s.


## Constructions

### In Cech-Deligne cohomology

Assume that $G$ is a [[simply connected]] [[Lie group]].

In ([Brylinski-McLaughlin I](#GeomConstructionFirst)) is spelled out an explicit constructin of $\hat c(\nabla)$ for given $\nabla$ in [[Cech cohomology|Cech]]-[[Deligne cohomology]]. This is a special case of the general construction presented in ([Brylinski-McLaughlin II](#CechCocyclesForCharClasses)).

In this section here we review this exlicit cocycle construction. In the [next section](#InInfChernWeil) we discuss a systematic way to "derive" this construction.
