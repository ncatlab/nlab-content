## Idea

A _Chern-Simons 2-gerbe_ is a cocycle in degree 4 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that is canonically associated to a $G$-[[principal bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]].

For $G$ a [[Lie group]] and $c : \mathcal{B}G \to K(\mathbb{Z},4)$ a cocycle for a degree 4 [[characteristic class]] in [[integral cohomology]] and $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], [[Chern-Weil theory]] provides a morphism (the refined [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]])

$$
  \hat c : G Bund_\nabla(X) \to H_{diff}^4(X)
$$

from $G$-[[principal bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ to degree 4 [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. The cocycles on the right may be thought of as

* [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]] $\hat c(\nabla)$;

* [[bundle gerbe|bundle 2-gerbe]]s with connection.

By construction, the [[curvature]] 4-form of $\hat c(\nabla)$ is the [[curvature characteristic form]] $\langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla\rangle$ of $\nabla$ and accordingly the 3-form connection on $\hat c(\nabla)$ is locally a [[Chern-Simons form]] $CS(\nabla)$ of $\nabla$.

Accordingly, the [[parallel transport]] induced by $\hat c(\nabla)$ over 3-dimensional manifolds $\phi : \Sigma \to X$ is the [[action functional]] of the [[quantum field theory]] called [[Chern-Simons theory]]. In this form it appears for instance as the [[gauge field]] called the [[supergravity C-field]] in certain [[supergravity]] theories. In particular, if (with due care) one takes $\nabla$ to be the _universal connection on the $G$-[[universal principal bundle]]_ over a smooth version of $B G$, then $\hat c(\nabla)$ is the background [[gauge field]] for bare [[Chern-Simons theory]].

Therefore this structure $\hat c(\nabla)$ has become known as the **Chern-Simons 2-gerbe**  of $\nabla$. We may also think of it as the _Chern-Simons [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]]_ .

At least for simply connected $G$ one may enhance the assignment $\nabla \mapsto \hat c(\nabla)$ to a morphism of [[∞-groupoid]]s

$$
  \hat \mathbf{c} : \mathbf{H}_conn(X,\mathbf{B}G)
  \to \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have the [[groupoid]] of smooth $G$-principal bundles with connection on $X$, and on the right the 3-groupoid of circle 3-bundles with connection. The [[homotopy fiber]]s of this morphism over a trivial circle 3-bundle with connection are 3-groupoids whose objects are naturally identified with pairs consisting of a connection $\nabla$ on a $G$-bundle and a _trivialization_ of its corresponding Chern-Simons 3-bundle. This in particular implies a trivialization of the underlying cocycle in degree 4 [[integral cohomology]] and therefore defines a [[string structure]]. One calls these homotopy fibers therefore [[differential string structure]]s.


## Constructions

### In Cech-Deligne cohomology {#InCechDelineCohomology}

In ([Brylinski-McLaughlin I](#GeomConstructionFirst)) is spelled out an explicit constructin of $\hat c(\nabla)$ for given $\nabla$ in [[Cech cohomology|Cech]]-[[Deligne cohomology]]. This is a special case of the general construction presented in ([Brylinski-McLaughlin II](#CechCocyclesForCharClasses)).


In this section here we review this exlicit cocycle construction. In the [next section](#InInfChernWeil) we discuss a systematic way to derive this construction.


Assume that $G$ is a [[simply connected]] compact simple [[Lie group]] such as the [[spin group]] and take the characteristic class $c$ to be that whose [[transgression]] to $G$ has as image in [[de Rham cohomology]] the de Rham class of the normalized canonical [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycle]] $\mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$.


For $P \to X$ a $G$-bundle with connection $\nabla$, there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ such that we have a [[Cech cohomology]] cocycle for $P$ given by a smooth transition function

$$
  g_{i,j} : U_i \cap U_j \to G 
$$ 

satisfying on $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k$ the cocycle condition $g_{i j} \cdot g_{j k} = g_{i k}$.

Since $G$ is assumed connected and [[simply connected]] and since for every Lie group the second [[homotopy group]] is trivial we have that the first nonvanshing homotopy group of $G$ is the third one. 

Therefore we can always find (possibly after refining the cover) a lift of this cocycle as follows:

* on double intersections, choose smooth functions

  $$
    \hat g_{i j} : (U_i \cap U_j) \times \Delta^1 \to G
  $$

  such that $\hat g_{i j}(x,0 ) = e$ is the identity in $g$, and such that such that $\hat g_{i j}(x,1) = g_{i j}(x)$;

* on triple intersections, choose smooth functions

  $$
    \hat g_{i j k} : (U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k) \times \Delta^2 \to G
  $$

  that cobound these paths in the evident way

  $$
    \array{
      && g_{i j}
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{\hat g_{i j}}}\nearrow 
      &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\hat g_{i j k}}}& 
      \searrow^{g_{i j} \cdot \mathrlap{\hat g_{j k}}}
      \\
      e &&\underset{\hat g_{i k}}{\to}&& g_{i k}
    }
  $$

  (this can be done because $\pi_1(G) = *$)

* on quadruple intersection choose smooth functions

  $$
    \hat g_{i j k l} : (U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \cap U_l) \times \Delta^3  \to G
  $$

  such that these 3-balls fill the evident tetrahedra.

  (this can be done because $\pi_2(G) = 0$).


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[Cech cohomology]] cocycle with coefficients in $\mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which is given by

$$
  c(g)_{i j k l} := \int_{\Delta^3} \hat g_{i j k l}^* \mu 
  \;\;\;\;\; mod \mathbb{Z} 
$$

is well defined and represents the class $c(P) \in H^4(X)$ in [[integral cohomology]]. 

Moreover, this refines to the cocycle in Cech-[[Deligne cohomology]] that is given by

$$
  \left(
     CS(\sigma_i^* A)
     \,,\;\;
     \int_{\Delta^1} CS((P\cdot \hat g_{i j})^* A)
     \,,\;\;
     \int_{\Delta^2} CS((P\cdot \hat g_{i j k})^* A)
     \,,\;\;
     \int_{\Delta^3} \hat g_{i j k l}^* \mu
     \;\;\; mod \mathbb{Z}
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where

* $A \in \Omega^1(P,\mathfrak{g})$ is the incarnation of the connection $\nabla$ as an [[Ehresmann connection]] given by a glbally defined 1-form on the total space $P \to X$ of the bundle;

* $\sigma_i : U_i \to P$ are the local [[section]]s of $P \to X$ that induce the original Cech cocycle $(g_{i j} := \sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j^{-1})$;

* $P \cdot \hat g_{i j} : \Delta^1 \to P$ is given by the right [[action]] of $G$ on $P$ and analogously for the other terms;

* $CS(...)$ denotes the [[Chern-Simons form]] of the given $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First notice that this is indeed well-defined: by compactness and simplicty of $G$ we have$\pi_3(G) = \mathbb{Z}$. By assumption on $\mu \in \Omega^3(G)$ we have that for any map $f : S^3 \to G$ we have $\int_{S^3} f^*\mu \in \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$. This implies that $c(g)$ is indeed a Cech cocycle.

Then the proof is effectively just the observation that the given collection of differential forms indeed does refine this to a Cech-cocycle with coefficients in the Deligne complex, and that therefore we can read off the image of the integral cohomoloy class $[c(g)]$ in de Rham cohomology from the curvature 4-form of this Deligne cocycle. That is by construction $\langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle \in \Omega^4_{cl}(X)$, which by [[Chern-Weil theory]] is indeed the image of the claimed integral class.

=--

So the only mystery about this construction is really: where does it come from? Apart from making this clever Ansatz and checking that it works, can one somehow systematically derive this construction? This we shall try to answer the section [below](#InInfChernWeil).



### In $\infty$-Chern-Weil theory {#InInfChernWeil}

The above Cech-Deligne cocycle construction of $\hat c(\nabla)$ may be understood as a special case of the general construction of Chern-Weil homomorphism by the methods discussed at [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]]. 

We first give now the main statement of how this works, and then afterwards explain where the various ingredients come from.

The basic ingredients in [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]] that give the refinement of a [[characteristic class]] to a morphism

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}G) \to \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^k U(1))
$$

from the $G$-principal bundles with connection to [[ordinary differential cohomology]] are this:

1. for a given [[Lie algebra]] $\mahfrak{g}$ the realization of the corresponding [[Lie group]] as a truncation of the simplicial presheaf

   $$
     (U,[n]) \mapsto \{C^\infty(U)\otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g})\}
   $$

   (see [[Lie integration]]);

1. the observation that, up to subtleties with the truncation, a [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycle]] 

   $$
     CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow CE(b^{k-1}\mathbb{R}) : \mu
   $$

   induces therefore an integrated cocycle $\mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^k U(1)$;

1. the observation that this is lifted to connections and differential refinement by 

   1. thickening the simplicial presheaf for $\mathbf{B}G$ to

      $$
        (U,[n]) \mapsto
        \left\{
          \array{
              C^\infty(U) \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n)
              &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}&
              CE(\mathfrak{g})
              \\
              \uparrow && \uparrow
              \\
              \Omega^\bullet(U) \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n)
              &\stackrel{(A,F_A)}{\leftarrow}&
              W(\mathfrak{g})
          }
        \right\}
      $$

  1. thickening the Lie algebra cocycle by its [[invariant polynomial]]
     and Chern-Simons element

     $$
       \array{
          CE(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}& CE(b^{k-1}\mathbb{R})
          \\
          \uparrow && \uparrow
          \\
          W(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{(cs,\langle -\rangle)}{\leftarrow}&
          W(b^{k-1} \mathbb{R})
       }
     $$

  and then postcomposing with that.


For the case at hand, let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a [[semisimple Lie algebra]], $\langle -\rangle \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ its canonical [[Killing form]] [[invariant polynomial]], $\mu = \langle -,[-,-]\rangle \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$ the corresponding [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycle]], $cs \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ the Chern-Simons elements exhibiting the transgression betweemn the two, $G$ the [[simply connected]] [[Lie group]] [[Lie integration|integrating]] it.

First consider the bare cocycle for the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle as the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#IntegrationOfCocycles">Lie integration of the cocycle </a> $\mu$.

###### Definition

Consider the [[simplicial presheaf]]

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g}) : (U,[n]) \{C^\infty(U) \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^n) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g})\} 
  \,,
$$

where here and in the following differential forms $\omega$ on simplices are taken to have _sitting instants_ in that for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists for every $k$-face of $\Delta^n$ an open neighbourhood such that $\omega$ restricted to that open neighbourhood is constant in the direction perpendicular to the boundary.

###### Lemma

The canonical map 

$$
  \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbf{B}G
$$

from the 3-[[coskeleton]] of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ to the [[delooping]] of the simply connected Lie group $G$ which is given on 1-morphisms by [[parallel transport]] is an equivalence ( in the [[model structure on simplicial presheave]] $[CartSp^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Use that a $\mthfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on the interval is canonically identified with a based path in $G$. Then use that for $k \leq 2$ we have $\pi_k(G) = 0$. See [[Lie integration]] for more.

###### Proposition

There is a commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \exp(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\exp(\mu)}{\to}& \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}}}
    \\
    \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  }  
  \,,
$$

where the right vertical morphism is the composite of the equivalence

$$
  \int_{\Delta^\bullet}  : \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}
$$

discussed at <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#IntegrationOfBnR">Integration to Line n-groups</a> with the evident quotient $\mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R} \to \maathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/mathbb{Z}$, where the copy of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is the lattice of periods of $\mu$ over 3-speheres in $G$.

=--

The top morphism sends a $U$-family of 3-morphisms $C^\infty(U) \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta 3) \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow} CE(\mathfrak{g})$ -- which we may  think of as a $U$-family of based 3-balls $\Sigma : U \times \Delta^3 \to G$ -- to the family of 3-forms

$$
  C^\infty(U) \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta 3) \stackrel{\Sigma}{\leftarrow} CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}
  CE(b^2 \mathbb{R})
  : 
  \mu(A)
  \,.
$$

The right veritcal morphism sends this its [[fiber integration]]

$$
  U \mapsto \int_{\Delta^3} \mu(A) \;\;\; \in \mathbb{R} 
$$

and regards the result then modulo $\mathbb{Z}$. That this indeed gives a morphism down at the bottom is the statement that for a 4-morphism in $\mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g})$ -- which is a 3-sphere $V : S^3 \to G$ -- we have that $int_{S^3} V^* \mu(A) = 0 mod \mathbb{Z}$, which is true by the fact that we take $\mathbb{Z}$ to be precisely generated by these periods. (Alternatively we can assume $\mu$ to be  normalized such that it generates the image in deRham cohomology of $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$).


+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Observation

For $\{U_i \to X\}$ a [[cover]] and $C(U) \in [CartSp^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ the corresponding [[Cech nerve]] we have that

* a morphism $g : C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G$ is precisely a Cech 1-cocycle with values in $G$;

* a lift

  $$
    \array{
       && \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g})
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\hat g}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
       \\
       C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}&
    }
  $$

  is precisely a lift of this cocycle to a system of paths, triangles and tetrahedra in $G$, as [above](#InCechDelineCohomology).

=--



+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition


Write $\exp(\mu) : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$ for the [[cocycle]] in [[Lie group cohomology]] obtained by <a href="http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#IntegrationOfCocycles">Lie integration of $\mu$</a> and write $\mathbf{B}^3 U(1) \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)$ for the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+an+(%E2%88%9E%2C1)-topos#CanonmicalFormOnG">canonical curvature invariant</a>.

Then:

for $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ a cocycle for a $G$-[[principal bundle]], the composite morphism 

$$
  X \to \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\exp(\mu)}{\to} \mathbf{B}^3 U(1) \stackrel{}{\to} \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)
$$ 

in [[∞LieGrpd]] is modeled in the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] by the span of morphism

$$
  \array{
     && 
     \exp(\mathfrak{g} \to inn(\mathfrak{g}))/_{\sim_3,\mathbb{Z}}
     &\stackrel{\exp((cs,P))}{\to}&
     \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R} \to inn(b^2 \mathbb{R}))/_{\sim_3,\mathbb{Z}}

    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    && \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{\sim_3, \mathbb{Z}}
    &\stackrel{\exp(\mu)}{\to}&
    \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R})_{\sim_3 / \mathbb{Z}}

    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}

    C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G && \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
   && \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)_{chn}
   \\
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
   \\
   X
  }
$$

and the total outer composite $C(U) \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)_{chn}$ has as components precisely the Cech-Deligne cocycle discussed [above](#InCechDelineCohomology).

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Recall first the [[Lie integration]] of this bare cocycle:

The simply connected Lie group $G = Spin$ corresponding to $\mathfrak{g}$ has $\pi_2(G) = 0$ and $\pi_3(G) = \mathbb{Z}$. The Lie integrated model for $\mathbf{B}G$ on which the cocycle integrates is

$$
  \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}
  \mathbf{cosk}_3 (\exp(\mathfrak{g})
  =
  \mathbf{cosk}_3(
  (U,[k]) \mapsto 
  \Omega^1_{flat}(\Delta^k,\mathfrak{g}) \otimes C^\infty(U))
  )
  \,.
$$

The weak equivalence to $\mathbf{B}G$ is given by [[nLab:parallel transport]]: it sends a flat $\mathfrak{g}$-valued form $A = \lambda d t$ with $\lambda \in C^\infty(U,\mathfrak{g})$ to the group element $P \exp(\int_0^1 \lambda d t)$.

Two such 1-forms $\lambda d t$ and $\lambda' d t$ are equivalent in $\mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g})$ precisely if they are the restrictions of a flat $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on the disk, which indeed, by the [[nonabelian Stokes theorem]] is the case precisely if their parallel transport coincides. By identifying the basepoint with the neutral element in $G$, flat $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on $\Delta^k$ correspond bijectively with smooth maps $\Delta^k \to G$. Since $\pi_2(G)$ vanishes, any two such flat 1-forms on disks with coinciding boundary can be filled by a 3-ball. The coskeleton operation finally identifies all 3-balls with coinciding boundary. 

The integrated cocycle

$$
  \exp(\mu)
  : 
  \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g})
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathb{Z}
$$

sends a 3-ball $\sigma : \Delta^3 \to G$ to the integral of $\mu$ over it

$$
  \exp(\mu) : \sigma \mapsto \int_{\Delta^3} \sigma^* \mu \; mod \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

Now given a Cech cocycle $\{g_{i j}\}$ for a $G$-bundle, we may always find a refined cover $\{U_i \to X\}$ on which the cocycle lifts to this resolution

$$
  \array{
    && \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{\sim_3, \mathbb{Z}}
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    C(\{U_i\}) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$

Choosing $\hat g$ amounts to

1. choosing on each double intersection $U_{i} \cap U_j$ a smooth based family of paths $\hat g_{i j} : U_i \cap U_j \times \Delta^1 \to G$ such that $\hat g_{i j}(0) = e$ and $\hat g_{i j}(1) = g_{i j}$;

1. choosing on each triple intersection a smooth family of based disks $\hat g_{i j k} : U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \times \Delta^2 \to G$ in $G$, cobounding these paths.

1. choosing on each quadruple intersection a smooth family of based balls $\hat g_{i j k l} : U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \cap U_l \times \Delta^3 \to G$ in $G$, cobounding these disks, or rather their homotopy class, relative boundaries, $[\hat g_{i j k l}]$.

That these choices exist locally, and hence for sufficiently refined cover $\{U_i \to X\}$ is the fact that $\pi_0(G) = *$ and $\pi_1(G) = 0$ and $\pi_2(G) = 0$, which is essential part of the statement that the morphism $\mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} \exp(\mathfrak{g})/_{\sim_3}$ that we are lifting through is indeed a weak equivalence.

The characteristic class corresponding to the Lie integated cocycle $\exp(\mu)$ is then modeled by the morphism

$$
  \array{
    && \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{\sim_3, \mathbb{Z}}
    &\stackrel{\exp(\mu)}{\to}&
    \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R})_{\sim_3 / \mathbb{Z}}
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    C(\{U_i\}) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G && \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

which on quadruple intersections takes $[\hat g_{i j k l}]$ to $\int_{\Delta^3} \hat g_{i j k l}^* \mu  mod \; \mathbb{Z}$.

This [[Cech cohomology]] model for $\frac{1}{2}p_1$ is the one discussed [above](#InCechDelineCohomology).

We now further resolve this model in order to lift the characteristic class to differential cohomology.

$$
  \array{
     && 
     \exp(\mathfrak{g} \to inn(\mathfrak{g}))/_{\sim_3,\mathbb{Z}}
     &\stackrel{\exp(\mu,P)}{\to}&
     \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R} \to inn(b^2 \mathbb{R}))/_{\sim_3,\mathbb{Z}}
    &\to&
    \exp(* \to b^3 \mathbb{R})
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\hat \nabla}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} 
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    && \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{\sim_3, \mathbb{Z}}
    &\stackrel{\exp(\mu)}{\to}&
    \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R})_{\sim_3 / \mathbb{Z}}
    && \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)_{simp}
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}

   && \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)_{chn}
  }
  \,.

For the connection $\hat \nabla$ we need to choose

1. $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms $A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i, \mathfrak{g})$;

1. $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms $\hat A_{i j} = A_{i j} + \lambda_{i j} \in \Omega^1(U_{i j} \times \Delta^1)$ whose restriction $\lambda_{i j}$ to $\Delta^1$ is the given path in $G$;

1. etc.

Recall that we say this forms a _genuine_ connection if the coresponding [[curvature]] 2-forms have no component along the simplices.

We can build a genuine connection $\hat \nabla$ from the cocycle $\{g_{i j}, A_i\}$ for an ordinary connection 
on the underlying ordinary cocycle $g_{i j}$: take $\hat A_{i j}(0) = A_i$ and then let $\hat A_{i j}$ be the unique solution to the differential equation

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} A_{i j}
  =
  d \lambda_t + [\lambda_t, \hat A_{i j}]
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the condition that he curvature 2-form has no component along the 1-simplex.

In other words, if $\hat g_{i j} : U_{i j } \times \Delta^1 \to G$ is the path obtained from parallel transport of $\lambda$, then we set

$$
  A_{i j}(t) := \hat g_{i j}(t)^{-1} (A_i + d) \hat g_{i j}(t)
  \,.
$$

Notably, by the fact that $\{A_i, g_{i j}\}$ is assumed to be a cocycle for an ordinary connection, this way we have

$$
  A_{i j}(1) = g_{i j}^{-1} (A_i + d) g^{i j} = A_j
 \,.
$$

Similarly we may transport the connection 1-forms around over the higher simplices to obtain $\hat A_{i j k}$ and $\hat A_{i j k l}$. This defines a lift $\hat \nabla : C(\{U_i\}) \to \exp(\mathfrak{g} \to inn(\mathfrak{g}))/_{\sim_3, \mathbb{Z}}$.

By collecting all this data, we find that the composite morphism

$$
  C(\{U_i\})
  \stackrel{\hat \nabla}{\to}
  \exp(\mathfrak{g} \to inn(\mathfrak{g})/_\sim
  \stackrel{\exp(\mu,P)}{\to}
  \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R} \to inn(b^2 \mathbb{R})/_\sim
  \stackrel{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{diff}
$$

is the Cech-Deligne cocycle

$$
  (CS(A_i), \int_{\Delta^1} CS(\hat A_{i j} ), \int_{\Delta^2} CS(\hat A_{i j k}), \int_{\Delta^3} \mu(A_{i j k l}))
  \,.
$$


This is is exactly equal to the cocycle discussed [above](#InCechDelineCohomology).
