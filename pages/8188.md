## Sequence spaces

The sequences spaces are basic examples of [[topological vector spaces]].  They all have a discrete flavour that (maybe) makes them easy to understand, but they are not actually [[discrete spaces]].

The classical sequence spaces are spaces of [[infinite sequences]] (hence the name), although they work for [[functions]] on any [[set]].


## Terminology

The name 'sequence space' is not often encountered, although it\'s useful as a general name without symbols in it.  Otherwise people just use the names, like ‘$c_0$’ and ‘$l^p$’, that appear below for specific examples.


## Definitions

Fix a [[set]] $N$; typically, $N$ is the set $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural numbers]], but this is not necessary for the basic concepts.  Sometimes one uses the set $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]] (which is the [[underlying set]] of an [[abelian group]], useful for some purposes), which of course is [[bijective]] with $\mathbb{N}$.  For the simplest examples, let $N$ be a [[finite set]].

Also fix a [[topological vector space]] $C$; typically, $C$ is either the space $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]] or the space $R$ of [[real numbers]].  We will assume below that $C$ is at least a [[Banach space]]; but since much of the point of the sequence spaces is to be simple examples of Banach spaces, you probably want something familiar as $C$.

We will think of a [[function]] from $N$ to $C$ as a __$C$-valued $N$-sequence__, or simply a __sequence__.  The various sequence spaces will be [[subsets]] of the [[function set]] $C^N$ of all sequences.  In general, if ‘$X$’ is the symbol for a sequence space, then we may specify $N$ and $C$ by writing ‘$X(N,C)$’, but often this is suppressed.

###### Definition

$l^1$ is the space of __absolutely summable sequences__:
$$ \sum_k {|a_k|} \lt \infty .$$
=--

This becomes a [[Banach space]] under the norm
$$ {\|a\|_1} \coloneqq \sum_k {|a_k|} .$$

More generally, for $0 \lt p \lt \infty$:

###### Definition

$l^p$ is the space of __absolutely $p$th-power summable sequences__:
$$ \sum_k {|a_k|^p} \lt \infty .$$
=--

For $1 \leq p \lt \infty$, this becomes a [[Banach space]] under the norm
$$ {\|a\|_p} \coloneqq \sqrt[p]{\sum_k {|a_k|^p}} .$$
Otherwise, it is an [[F-space]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

$l^\infty$ is the space of __absolutely bounded sequences__:
$$ \sup_k {|a_k|} \lt \infty .$$
=--

This becomes a [[Banach space]] under the supremum norm
$$ {\|a\|_\infty} \coloneqq \sup_k {|a_k|} .$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

$c_c$ is the space of __almost-zero sequences__:
$$ \ess\forall k,\; a_k = 0 ,$$
where ‘$\ess\forall$’ means 'for all but finitely many' ($\tilde{K}$-[[K-finite|finite]] in [[constructive mathematics]]).
=--

This is given the topology of [[compact convergence]] (here, convergence on finite subsets).

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

$c_0$ is the space of __zero-limit sequences__:
$$ \forall \epsilon,\; \ess\forall k,\; {|a_k|} \lt \epsilon ,$$
where as usual $\epsilon$ is a [[positive number]] and again ‘$\ess\forall$’ means 'for all but finitely many'.
=--

This is given the supremum norm (see $l^\infty$ above), becoming a [[Banach space]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

$c_\infty$ is the space of __convergent sequences__:
$$ \exists L,\; \forall \epsilon,\; \ess\forall k,\; {|a_k - L|} \lt \epsilon ,$$
where $L$ is an element of $C$ and the other notation is as in $c_0$ above.
=--

This is also given the supremum norm (as above), becoming a [[Banach space]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

$c_b$ is the space of __absolutely bounded sequences__:
$$ \sup_k {|a_k|} \lt \infty .$$
=--

This is yet another [[Banach space]] under the supremum norm.  Indeed, $c_b = l^\infty$, two different ways of thinking about the same thing.


## Properties

For $0 \lt p \lt q \lt \infty$, we have $c_c \subseteq l^p \subseteq l^q \subseteq c_0$, with each space [[dense subspace|dense]] in the next (using the topology of the next).  This continues: $c_0 \subseteq c_\infty \subseteq c_b = l^\infty$, but now each space, far from being dense, is a [[closed subspace]] of the next (with the [[induced topology]]).

When $N$ is [[finite set|finite]], these spaces are all the same, being just the [[cartesian spaces]] $C^N$; when $N$ is [[infinite set|infinite]], the inclusions above are all proper (at least if $C$ is nontrivial).

The various [[direct sums of Banach spaces]] follow the sequence spaces $l^p$ for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.

The spaces $c_c$, $c_0$, $c_\infty$, and $c_b$ are the corresponding spaces $C_c$, $C_0$, $C_\infty$, and $C_b$ of [[continuous maps]] on the [[discrete space]] $N$ (thought of as a [[local compactum]]).  That these all agree when $N$ is finite is a special case of a theorem for [[compacta]].

Similarly, the spaces $l^p$ are simply the [[Lebesgue spaces]] $L^p$ for [[counting measure]] on $N$.

The [[Riesz representation theorems]] give many nice results for the [[dual vector space|dual spaces]] of the sequence spaces:
*  the dual of $c_0$ is $l^1$,
*  the dual of $l^p$ is $l^q$ for $p + q = p q$ and $1 \lt p , q \lt \infty$,
*  the dual of $l^1$ is $l^\infty$,
*  the dual of $l^\infty$ is $l^1$ in [[dream mathematics]], but something much larger in [[classical mathematics]].


## In constructive mathematics

The spaces $c_c$, $c_0$, and $c_\infty$ work just fine in [[constructive mathematics]].  For $l^p$, we need $N$ to have [[decidable equality]] to define $\|a\|_p$; even so, $\|a\|_p$ (even when bounded) is only a [[lower real number]], and we usually require it be [[located real number|located]] to have an element of $l^p$.  With these caveats, $l^p$ works just fine for $0 \lt p \lt \infty$.  For $c_b = l^\infty$, however, we do not have a [[Banach space]] with [[located real number|located]] [[norms]], as is usually required for constructive [[functional analysis]] ... well, unless we require $N$ to be [[finite set|finite]] (in the strictest sense), which leaves out the motivating example.  Nevertheless, we can still treat $l^\infty$ as a semicontinuous Banach space, that is one where the norms may be any bounded [[lower reals]], and we can also consider semicontinuous versions of $l^p$.  (Another way to treat $l^\infty$ may be formally, as the [[dual vector space|dual]] of $l^1$; I don\'t know how well this works.)
