A **dg-ideal** $J \subset A$ is an alternative name for an [[ideal]] in a [[dg-algebra]] $A$, i.e. a $A$-$A$-dg-subbimodule of $A$. Of course, one can also talk about one-sided ideals. 

This means that $J$ is a graded sub-vector space that is closed under product by element in $A$ from either side, and closed under acting with the differential.
