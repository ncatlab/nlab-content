Word period in mathematics has many meaning, most of them coming from physics: period of an oscillation, period of a [[periodic function]], periods in cellestial mechanics. 

However there is another deep notion of periods in number theory and more specific version related to specific situations in algebraic geometry. We distinguish irrational and rational numbers. Complex numbers divide into algebraic and transcendental. __Periods__ are more general than algebraic numbers: they are those (complex) numbers which can be obtained as integrals of algebraic functions (whose all coefficients are also algebraic numbers) over semialgebraic sets. Period form a subfield of complex numbers bigger than the field of algebraic numbers. There are several operations which lead to new periods. In fact if we view them abstractly, as integrals of some abstract function over abstract semialgebraic set, then we can take unions of such sets, do partial integration and so on. There is a conjecture that there are no relations among periods except those of a short list of such obvious relations! 

Periods appear in a number of situations in classical algebraic geometry. Specific matrices of periods  are defined and important in the theory of algebraic functions, Hodge theory for algebraic cycles, study of actions of motivic Galois group etc. They come as generalizations of "periods of Riemann surfaces" from 19th century.
