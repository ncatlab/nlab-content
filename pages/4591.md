The multiplicative identity in the [[natural numbers]], [[integers]], [[real numbers]] and [[complex numbers]] is called **one** and written as $1$.  

More generally, in any [[group]], or even any [[monoid]], the group operation is often called 'multiplication' and written as juxtaposition, and then the identity element is called **one** and written as $1$.  As a consequence, in any [[ring]], or more generally any [[rig]], the two binary operations are called 'addition' and 'multiplication', and the identity for multiplication is called **one**.

[[vertical categorification|Categorifying]] this idea, in any [[monoidal category]] the monoidal unit may be called **one**.  This is especially true in the case of a [[cartesian monoidal category]], that is a category with (at least finitary) [[products]].  In this case the [[terminal object]], which serves as the identity for products, is often called **one**:

$$x \times 1 \cong x$$

For example, in the category [[Set]], the [[singleton set]] is often written $1$ in the category-theoretic literature.

Categorifying [[horizontal categorification|horizontally]] instead, any [[identity morphism]] may be thought of as an analog of one and is often written $1$.

All these ideas can be, and have been, categorified further.
