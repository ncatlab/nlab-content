## Idea

The _coherence theorem for [[monoidal bicategories]]_, like many [[coherence theorems]], has several forms (or, alternatively, refers to several different theorems):

1. Every diagram of constraint 2-cells in a free [[monoidal bicategory]] commutes.

1. Every monoidal bicategory is equivalent to a [[Gray-monoid]].

The second version is a direct corollary of the [[coherence theorem for tricategories]].  The first can then be deduced from it (not entirely trivially).
