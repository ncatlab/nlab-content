## Idea

The _state monad_ is a [[monad (in computer science)]] used to implement computational storage and retreaval of data in [[functional programming]].

A [[functional program]] with input of [[type]] $X$, output of [[type]] $Y$ and mutable state type $W$ is a [[function]] ([[morphism]]) of [[type]] $X \times W \longrightarrow Y \times W$.

## Properties

### Realization in dependent type theory

In a [[locally Cartesian closed category]]/[[dependent type theory]] $\mathbf{H}$, then to every type $W$ is associated its [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_W}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{W^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_W}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

In terms of this the state monad is the composite

$$
  State = \sum_W W^\ast \prod_W W^\ast 
$$

of [[context extension]], followed by [[dependent product]] , followed by [[context extension]], followed by [[dependent sum]].

Here $\prod_W W^\ast = [W,-]$ is called the _[[function monad]]_ or _[[reader monad]]_ and $\sum_W W^\ast = W \times (-)$ is the _[[writer comonad]]_.
