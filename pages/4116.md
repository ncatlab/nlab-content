## Idea

As category, the category $Top$ of topological spaces notoriously lacks some desirable features. There are therefore quite a few attempts to define "big" categories that contain (all) interesting topological spaces but enjoy better properties. The **topological topos** was proposed in this vein by [[Peter Johnstone]] in the seventies. As it is conceptually based on sequential convergence it plays an important role in constructive mathematics.


## Definition

Let [[Top]] be the [[category]] of [[topological space]]s, and let $\Sigma$ be the [[full subcategory]] whose only two [[object]]s are a one-point space and $\mathbb{N}^+$, the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[discrete space]] of [[natural number]]s. Let $J$ be the [[canonical Grothendieck topology]] on $\Sigma$. 

Johnstone's **topological topos** (specifically, the one described in the [eponymous paper](#Johnstone79)) is the [[topos]] of canonical [[sheaves]] $Sh_J(\Sigma)$ on $\Sigma$. The functor 

$$Top \to Set^{\Sigma^{op}}: X \mapsto Top(-, X)$$ 

is [[faithful functor|faithful]] and factors through $Sh_J(\Sigma)$, and its restriction to the category of [[sequential space|sequential spaces]] is full.

The category of [[subsequential spaces]] can also be found as a full subcategory of this topos (in fact, it consists of the separated objects for a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]]).  A general object of the topos can be thought of as being like a subsequential space, but such that a given sequence can converge to a given point in "more than one way."

Importantly, following an idea by Joyal, the topological topos $\mathcal{E}:=Sh_J(\Sigma)$ allows one to represent the [[geometric realization]] functor $sSet \to \mathcal{E}$ as the inverse image of a [[geometric morphism]] from $\mathcal{E}$ to the topos of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]]. As Johnstone points out, this approach fails for the [[big topos]] on $Top$ and also for Lawvere's topos for [[continuum mechanics]].
