## Idea

A _limit_ of a [[sequence]] (or [[net]]) of points $(x_i)$ in a [[topological space]] $X$ is a point $x$ such that the sequence eventually gets arbitrarily close to $x$.

The notion is of particular and historical important in [[analysis]], where it serves to define for instance the notion of [[derivative]].

More generally there is a notion of limit for sequences/nets in [[convergence spaces]].

## Definition

If $X$ a [[topological space]] and $I$ the set of [[natural numbers]] (or more generally any [[directed set]]) and $(x_i)_{i\in I} \colon I \to X$ a [[sequence]] (a [[net]]) of points in $X$, one says that a point $x \in X$ is a **limit** of $(x_i)$ or that $(x_i)$ **converges** to $x$ if for all [[open neighbourhoods]] $U \subset X$ of $x$ there exists an $i_U \in I$ such that $x_i \in U$ for all $i \gt i_U$.

Warning: if $X$ is not a [[Hausdorff topological space]], there might be more than one point $x$ with the property that $(x_i)$ converges to $x$. Then we say that the sequence converges to the _set_ of all such points.
