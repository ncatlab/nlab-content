This page collects the various networks and communities, in the largest possible sense, of mathematicians and non mathematicians whose research is category-theory oriented.

It is by no means a comprehensive list, in strict alphabetic order.

1. [CoACT](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/centre-of-australian-category-theory-coact), the centre of Australian Category Theory (!!! This link is probably outdated)
2. [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io), the network of Italian category theorists. See the updated [event page](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest.html)!
3. [TallCats](https://compose.ioc.ee), the Compositional Systems and Methods group at TalTech University, Tallinn, Estonia.
4. The [Topos institute](https://topos.institute), an "independent scientific institute devoted to fundamental inquiry that shapes the technologies of tomorrow".

Feel free to continue the list!
