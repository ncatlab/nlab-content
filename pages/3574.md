Let $R$ be a unital ring.

Consider also a finite sequence $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ of elements in $R$. 

Given any central element $x\in Z(R)$, one can define a two term complex 

$$ K(x) = (0\to R\stackrel{x}\to R\to 0) $$

concentrated in degrees $1$ and $2$, where the map is the left multiplication by $x$. Given a sequence $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ of central elements in $R$ one can define the tensor product 

$$K(x_1,\ldots,x_r) = K(x_1)\otimes_R K(x_2)\otimes_R\cdots \otimes_R K(x_r) $$

of complexes of left $R$-modules. Degree $p$ part of $K(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ equals the exterior power $\Lambda^{p+1}R^r$. Consider the usual bases elements $e_{i_0}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}$ of $\Lambda^{p+1}R^r$, where $1\leq i_0\lt i_1\lt\cdots\lt i_p\leq r$. Then the differential is given by

$$
d(e_{i_0}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}) = \sum_{k = 0}^{p}(-1)^{k+1} x_{i_k} e_{i_0}\wedge \cdots\wedge \hat{e}_{i_k} \wedge \cdots\wedge e_{i_r}
$$

The differential can be obtained from the faces of the obvious Koszul semi-simplicial $R$-module and the chain complex above is obtained by the usual alternating sum rule. 

Now let $A$ be a finitely generated left $R$-module. Then the abelian groups

$$ H_q(x_1,\ldots,x_r; A) = H_q(K(x_1,\ldots,x_r)\otimes_R A), $$

$$ H^q(x_1,\ldots,x_r;A) = H^q(Hom_R(K(x_1,\ldots,x_r),A)), $$

together with connecting homomorphisms, form a homological and cohomological delta functors (in the sense of [[nlab:Tohoku]]) respectively, deriving the zero parts

$$ H_0 = A/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)A$$

$$ H^0 = Hom_R(R/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)R,A)$$

where $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)A$ is the left $R$-submodule generated by $x_1,\ldots,x_r$. A Poincare-like duality holds: $H_p(x_1,\ldots,x_r;A) = H^{r-p}(x_1,\ldots,x_r;A)$. 

The sequence $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ is called __$A$-regular__ (or regular on $A$) if for all $i$ the image of $x_i$ in $A/(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1})A$ annihilates only zero. This terminology is in accord with calling a non-zero divisor in a ring a "regular element" (and is in accord with the terminology regular local rings).

If $\mathbf{x}$ is a regular sequence on/in $R$ then $K(\mathbf{x},R)$ is a free resolution of the module $R/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)R$ and the cohomology $H^q(x_1,\ldots,x_r;A) = Ext^q_R(R/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)R,A)$ while homology $H_q(x_1,\ldots,x_r;A) = Tor_q^R(R/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)R,A)$.

The resolution of $R/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)R$ can be written

$$
0 \to \Lambda^r(R^r)\to \cdots \to \Lambda^2(R^r)\to R^r \to R \to R/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)R\to 0$$

and the $R$-linear map $R^r\to R$ is given by the row vector $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$.

[arXiv:1004.0096](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1004.0096) The Koszul complex is the cotangent complex
from arXiv Front: math.KT by Joan Milles
We extend the Koszul duality theory of associative algebras to algebras over
an operad. Recall that in the classical case, this Koszul duality theory relies
on an important chain complex: the Koszul complex. We show that the cotangent
complex, involved in the cohomology theory of algebras over an operad,
generalizes the Koszul complex.
