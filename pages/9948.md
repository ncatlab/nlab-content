
## Idea

The [[zero object]] in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]]/[[stable homotopy category]].

As a [[sequential spectrum]] this is represented by the sequence of [[pointed topological space]] which consists of the one-point space in each degree (an [[Omega-spectrum]]). This particular representative happens to be itself the [[zero object]] in the [[1-category]] of [[sequential spectra]]. But, as usual, there are other sequential spectra, not [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to this one, which still represent the [[zero-spectrum]] in the [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra (hence which are connected to the spectrum constant on the point by a sequence of [[weak equivalences]] in the stable [[model structure on topological sequential spectra]]).
