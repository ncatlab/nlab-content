(That is, $\ln(-1) \div \sqrt{-1} = \pi$.)

Augustus de Morgan is a 19th-century mathematician and logician most famous for the [[de Morgan laws]], even though he did not formulate them.  He did, however, contribute (along with [[George Boole]], [[Charles Peirce]], etc) to the work of making [[logic]] into a mathematical discipline.
