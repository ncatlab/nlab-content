I'm a french math/computer science student. I'm finishing my masters program as a visitor in Ottawa under the supervision of Rick Blute and Phil Scott and will probably soon continue as a PhD student.

I work on differential categories and related things. I've  defined a new type of differential categories which uses graded exponentials and allows to work with finite-dimensional vector spaces. I'm currently working on two algebraic characterizations of symmetric powers in terms of some kind of graded bialgebras as well as in terms of creation and annihilation operators. It's similar to the Fox theorem on products but for symmetric powers. So basically my focus in on the logic and algebra of differentiation in symmetric monoidal categories.

More explanations to come on the nLab.
