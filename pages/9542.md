## Idea

The _Moyal product_ is a [[formal deformation quantization]] of a linear [[Poisson manifold]], hence of a [[vector space]] $V$ equipped with a [[Poisson bivector]] $\pi \in V \wedge V$, regarded as a constant (translation invariant) [[tensor field|bivector field]].

Moyal quantization serves as an intermediate step in quantization of more general situations:

Given a [[symplectic manifold]], then Moyal quantization applies in each [[fiber]] of the [[tangent bundle]]. The resulting [[fiber bundle]] of Moyal algebras admits a [[flat connection]] (non-uniquely) compatible with the algebra structure. The [[covariantly constant sections]] of this Moyal-algebra bundle constitute a [[formal deformation quantization]] of the symplectic manifold, see at _[[Fedosov's deformation quantization]]_.

With a little care, the Moyal construction applies also to infinite-dimensional Poisson vector spaces such as appear in [[local field theory]].  Here the Moyal quantization yields [[formal deformation quantization]] of [[free field theories]] to [[perturbative quantum field theories]], the result are the _[[Wick algebras]]_ of free field theory ([Dito 90](#Dito90), [Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](#DutschFredenhagen01)). Combining this this with [[Fedosov's deformation quantization]] as above yields [[interaction|interacting]] [[perturbative quantum field theories]] as constructed via [[causal perturbation theory]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16)), see at _[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]]_ for more on this.


## Definition

The Moyal [[star product]] on [[smooth functions]] $C^\infty(V)$ is given on $f,g \in C^\infty(V)$ by

$$
  f \star g \coloneqq prod \circ \exp(\hbar \pi)(f , g)
  \,,
$$

where in the exponent we regard $\pi$ as an [[endomorphism]] on the [[tensor product]] $C^\infty(V) \otimes C^\infty(V)$ by [[differentiation]] in each argument, where the [[exponential]] denotes the corresponding [[formal power series]] of iterated applications of this endomorphism, and where $prod \colon C^\infty(V) \otimes C^\infty(V) \to C^\infty(V)$ is the usual pointwise product of functions.

This means that given a choice of [[basis]] $\{x^i\}_i$ of $V$ such that $\pi$ has components $\{\pi^{i j}\}_{i j}$ in this basis, the resulting [[formal power series]] in the formal parameter $\hbar$ ("[[Planck's constant]]") starts out as

$$
  (f \star g) =
  f \cdot g
  + 
  \hbar 
  \sum_{i,j} \pi^{i j} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\cdot \frac{\partial g}{\partial x^j}
  + 
  \frac{1}{2}
  \hbar^2
  \sum_{i,j,k, l} \pi^{k l} \pi^{i j} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^k\partial x^i}\cdot \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial x^k \partial x^j}
   + 
  \cdots
$$

## Properties

### Via geometric quantization

The Moyal quantization of a Poisson vector space $(V,\pi)$ arises equivalently as the canonical [[geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids]] of the [[symplectic groupoid]] which is the [[Lie integration]] of the corresponding [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] ([GBV 94](#GBV), [EH 06](#EH)).
