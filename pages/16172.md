## Idea

In ([[pseudo-Riemannian geometry|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian geometry]], a _cone_ is a part of a  (pseudo-)[[Riemannian manifold]] where the metric  [[metric tensor]] is locally of the form $d s^2 = d r^2 + r^2 d s^2_1$. The point that would correspond to $r = 0$ is the "conical singularity". 

## Examples

### $G_2$-manifolds
 {#ExamplesG2Manifolds}

Three examples of cones that [[simply-connected]] [[G2-manifolds]] seem to be known: cones on $\mathbb{C}P^3$, $SU(3)/U(1)\times U(1)$ and $S^3 \times S^3$. ([Atiyah-Witten 01](#AtiyahWitten01))
