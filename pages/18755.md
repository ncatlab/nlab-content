## Definition

The _Compton wavelength_ is a [[physical unit]] that governs the [[dispersion relation]]/[[energy-momentum relation]] of [[mass|massive]] [[field (physics)|fields]].

For a [[particle]]/[[field (physics)|field]] of [[mass]] $m$, its _Compton wavelength_ is the [[length]]

$$
  \frac{\hbar}{m c}
$$

where $c$ denotes the [[speed of light]] and $\hbar$ denotes [[Planck's constant]].

The inverse of the Compton wavelength appears as the [[mass]] term notably in the [[Klein-Gordon equation]] of the [[scalar field]] or the [[Dirac equation]] of the [[Dirac field]].
