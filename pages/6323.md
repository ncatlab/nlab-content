## Idea

_Haag's theorem_ (due to [[Rudolf Haag]], D. Hall, and [[Arthur Wightman]]) is a statement in the context of the fact that the [[Stone-von Neumann theorem]] _fails_ for a  non-finite number of dimensions/degrees of freedom: it states that in interacting [[quantum field theory]] (as opposed to [[quantum mechanics]] with finitely many degrees of freedom) there is in general no unitary equivalence between the free field CCR representation and that of the interacting fields.



## References

Haag's theorem was first stated in 

* [[Rudolf Haag]], _On quantum field theorie_, Det Kongelige Danske Viden-
skabernes Selskab, Matematisk-fysiske Meddelelser 29, nr. 12: 1-37.(1955)

but the proof had some gaps. It was completed in 

* D. Hall, [[Arthur Wightman]]  _A theorem on invariant analytic functions with applications to relativistic quantum field theory_ , Det Kongelige
Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, Matematisk-fysiske Meddelelser 31, nr. 5:
1-41.(1957)

A brief statement in context is on pages 54-55 of

* [[Rudolf Haag]], _[[Local Quantum Physics -- Fields, Particles, Algebras]]_

A thorough discussion of meaning and implications of Haag's theorem (pointing out plenty of flaws on this point in the standard literature) is in

* John Earman, Doreer Fraser, _Haag's theorem and its implications for the foundations of quantum field theory_ ([pdf](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2673/1/earmanfraserfinalrevd.pdf))
