## Idea

_Haag's theorem_ ([Haag 55](#Haag55), [Hall 57](#Hall57)) says that for a non-[[finite number]] of generators the [[canonical commutation relations]] do _not_ have a unique (up to [[isomorphism]]) [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[unitary representation]].

This is in contrast to the [[Stone-von Neumann theorem]] which says that for a [[finite number]] of generators the [[Schrödinger representation]] is, up to isomorphism, the unique irrducible unitary representation of the [[canonical commutation relations]].

While [[canonical commutation relations]] with a [[finite number]] of generators appear in [[quantum mechanics]], those appearing in [[quantum field theory]] (see e.g. [[Wick algebras]] for [[free fields]]) generically have infinitely many generators and hence are subject to Haag's theorem.
