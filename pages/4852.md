Given (possibly weak) 2-categories, $A$ and $C$, and (possibly weak) 2-functors $F:A\to C$ and $U:C\to A$, a __biadjunction__ is given by specifying for each object $a$ in $A$ and each object $c$ in $C$ an [[equivalence of categories]] $C(F a,c)\cong A(a,U c)$, which is pseudonatural both in $a$ and in $c$. If there is a biadjunction in this sense, it can be replaced by a biadjunction for which this equivalence of categories is an adjoint equivalence. 

There are several other characterizations of biadjointness.
