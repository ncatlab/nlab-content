## Idea

Monadic algebras are type one [[modal algebras]], in which  the single operator behaves like a [[topological closure|closure]] operation in a [[topological space]], (so these are [[closure algebras]]) and, in addition, elements are closed if and only if they are open.


## Definitions

###### Definition

A **monadic algebra** is a [[closure algebra]], $(\mathbb{B}, m)$, which satisfies:
for all $x$, $x\leq l m x$,
where, as usual, $l$ is a shorthand for $\neg m \neg$.
