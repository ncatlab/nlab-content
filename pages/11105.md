## Idea

In [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]], one of the two linear versions of [[conjunction]] is called the _multiplicative conjunction_ and usually denoted “$\otimes$”.  The analogous connective in [[relevance logic]] is sometimes called the _intensional conjunction_ or the _fusion_ or _cotenability_, and sometimes denoted "$\circ$".

The [[categorical semantics]] of the multiplicative conjunction is as the [[tensor product]] with respect to a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category]] structure on the collection of [[types]].

If one retains of all [[conjunctions]] in linear logic only the multiplicative conjunction, then one speaks of the [[fragment]] of linear logic called _multiplicative linear logic_ or _multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic_ or _MILL_ for short. See also at _[[linear type theory]]_ for more on this.
