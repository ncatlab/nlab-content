## Idea

In [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]], one of the two linear versions of [[conjunction]] is called the _multiplicative conjunction_ and usually denoted “$\otimes$”.

The [[categorical semantics]] of the multiplicative conjunction is as the [[tensor product]] with respect to a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category]] structure on the collection of [[types]].
