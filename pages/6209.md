## Idea

A Baire space is a [[topological space]] that satisfies the conclusion of the [[Baire category theorem]].

It should not be confused with the [[space of irrational numbers]] (sometimes called 'Baire space' and coincidentally an example of a Baire space in our sense) or a [[Baire set]] (a [[subset]] somewhat analogous to a [[measurable set]] but defined by a topological property).


## Definition

A __Baire space__ is a [[topological space]] such that the [[intersection]] of any [[countable family]] of [[dense subspace|dense]] [[open subspace|open]] subspaces is also dense.


## Examples

*  The space of [[irrational numbers]], or equivalently of [[infinite sequences]] of [[natural numbers]], is a Baire space.  (This is not a very important example, except that this space is coincidentally also called 'Baire space'.)

*  Any [[complete metric space]] (or rather its [[underlying]] topological space) is a Baire space.

*  Any [[locally compact Hausdorff space]] is a Baire space.

*  Any [[open subspace]] of a Baire space is also a Baire space.

*  Any [[product space|product]] of Baire spaces is a Baire space.
