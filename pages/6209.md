## Idea

A Baire space is a [[topological space]] that satisfies the conclusion of the [[Baire category theorem]].

It should not be confused with the [[space of irrational numbers]] (sometimes called 'Baire space' and coincidentally an example of a Baire space in our sense) or a [[Baire set]] (a [[subset]] somewhat analogous to a [[measurable set]] but defined by a topological property).


## Definition

A __Baire space__ is a [[topological space]] such that the [[intersection]] of any [[countable family]] of [[dense subspace|dense]] [[open subspace|open]] subspaces is also dense.


## Examples

*  Any [[complete metric space]] (or rather its [[forgetful functor|underlying]] topological space) is a Baire space.

*  Any [[locally compact Hausdorff space]] is a Baire space. In fact, any [[G_delta set]] of a locally compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space under the [[subspace]] topology. 

*  Any [[open subspace]] of a Baire space is also a Baire space. 

**Note:** The space of [[irrational numbers]] $J$, or equivalently of [[infinite sequences]] of [[natural numbers]], is also known as 'Baire space'. $J$ is coincidentally a Baire space in the present sense (because its topology can be given by a complete metric), but aside from that, not much meaning should be attached to the fact it shares the same name.
