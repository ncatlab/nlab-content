## Definition ##

A **subquotient** of an object $X$ in some category is 

* a [[quotient object]] of a [[subobject]] of $X$, 

or 

* a subobject of a quotient object of $X$.  

## Properties

* The two definitions are equivalent whenever quotients are [[pullback stability|stable under pullback]] and subobjects are stable under pushout, such as in a [[topos]]. 

* Just as with subobjects and quotient objects, we have that $X$ is a subquotient of itself, and subquotients of subquotients of $X$ are themselves subquotients of $X$ in a natural way.

* Just as subobjects of a set $X$ are in correspondence with [[predicate]]s on $X$ and quotients of $X$ are in correspondence with [[equivalence relation]]s on $X$, subquotients of $X$ are in correspondence with [[partial equivalence relation]]s on $X$.

## Examples 

* In [[Grp]], all but six of the 26 [[sporadic finite simple groups]] are subquotients of the [[Monster group]], the largest such group.
