[[!redirects canonical momenta]]


Locally a [[symplectic manifold]] looks like $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ such that under this identification the [[symplectic form]] reads $\sum_{i = 1}^n d q_i \wedge d p^i$, for $\{q_i\}$ the canonical [[coordinates]] on one $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\{p^i\}$ for the other. 

In the context of [[mechanics]], with such an identification one calls _$p^i$_ the **canonical momentum** of the coordinate (or sometimes "canonical coordinate") $q_i$.

Beware that, despite this terminology, canonical momenta are in fact not canonically given, but require a choice of splitting as above. Moreover, in general such a splitting does not exist globally, on the whole symplectic manifold.
