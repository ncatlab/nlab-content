###### Eilenberg-Watts' Theorem

Given unital [[rings]] $R$ and $S$ and an $S$-$R$-[[bimodule]] $B$, the functor

$$ B \otimes_R - : R Mod \to S Mod $$

between the [[categories of modules]] which forms [[tensor products of modules]] is [[right exact functor|right exact]] and preserves [[small category|small]] [[coproducts]].  Conversely, if $F: Mod_R \to Mod_S$ is right exact and that preserves small coproducts, it is naturally isomorphic to $B \otimes_R -$ where $B$ is the $S$-$R$-bimodule $F(R)$. The theorem holds for nonunital rings as well, but then $B$ reconstructs as $F(R_1)$ where $R_1$ is the extension of $R$ by adjoining the unit element (the tensor product is still over the original $R$). If $F$ is a flat functor then $F(R_1)$ is flat over $R$.

This theorem was more or less simultaneously proved by Watts and Eilenberg, see [references](#References) below.
