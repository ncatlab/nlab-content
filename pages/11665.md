## Idea

The most basic version of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] over a ([[compact topological space|compact]]) [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] 11 has as [[field (physics)|fields]] [[cocycles]] $\hat D \colon X \to \mathbf{B}^5 U(1)_{conn}$ in degree-5 [[ordinary cohomology]] and whose [[action functional]] is given by the [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]] of the [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology]] of such a field with itself:

$$
  \hat D \mapsto \exp\left(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}\int_X \hat D \cup \hat D\right)
  \,.
$$

This is the direct generalization of $U(1)$-[[3d Chern-Simons theory]] of the abelian [[7d Chern-Simons theory]], and all three are related by [[holography]] to the [[self-dual higher gauge field]] in dimension 2,6, and 10, respectively.

However, for applications in [[string theory]] more refined versions of these theories matter. for instance in 7d  the full [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] contains not just a single abelian [[higher self-dual gauge field]] and accordingly the corresponding [[7d Chern-Simons theory]] is richer, namely is, by [AdS7/CFT6](#AdS-CFT#AdS7CFT6), the [[KK-compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on $S^4$. Similarly, in 10-dimensions the [[RR-field]] of [[type II superstring theory]] is a [[higher self-dual gauge field]] whose quantization law is of the form that makes it qualify ([Moore-Witten 99](#MooreWitten99)) as the holographic boundary theory of an 11d Chern-Simons theory. However, as a configuration of the [[RR-field]] is a [[cocycle]] in [[twisted differential K-theory]], so there should be an 11d Chern-Simons theory given ([Belov-Moore 06](#BelovMoore06)) by the [[fiber integration in differential cohomology]] of the [[cup product in differential cohomology]] in K-theory.
