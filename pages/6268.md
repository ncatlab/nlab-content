## Idea

A **classifying map** or **classifying morphism** for a given [[object]] is a [[morphism]] into a [[classifying space]] or [[moduli space]] that classified this object.

Typically this means that the map characterizes the object (only) up to [[equivalence]]. There is also the more refined concept of morphisms into a [[moduli stack]] that characterizes the object itself. For emphasis this case might be called a _[[modulating morphism]]_.


## Examples

* For [[subobjects]] one typically speaks of **[[characteristic maps]]** or **characteristic functions**. The corresponding classifiyng space is a _[[subobject classifier]]_ . 

* More generally, in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] every "small" (see there) object in a [[slice (infinity,1)-topos]] is given by a classifying morphism into the [[object classifier]];

* In [[dependent type theory|dependent]]/[[homotopy type theory|homotopy]] [[type theory]] these classifying morphisms are the [[categorical semantics]] for [[functions]] into a [[type of types]] that classify [[dependent types]]. See at _[[categorical model of dependent types]]_ for more on this.
