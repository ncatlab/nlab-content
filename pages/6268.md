## Idea

A **classifying map** or **classifying morphism** for a given [[object]] is a [[morphism]] into a [[classifying space]] that classified this object.

Where can I find a construction of the classifying morphism to a classifying space for a G-bundle with connection - using the connections as a 1-form?


## Examples

* For [[subobjects]] one typically speaks of **characteristic maps** or **characteristic functions**. The corresponding classifiyng space is a _[[subobject classifier]]_ . See there for more.

* More generally, in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] every "small" (see there) object in a [[slice (infinity,1)-topos]] is given by a classifying morphism into the [[object classifier]];

* In [[dependent type theory|dependent]]/[[homotopy type theory|homotopy]] [[type theory]] these classifying morphisms are the [[categorical semantics]] for [[functions]] into a [[type of types]] that classify [[dependent types]]. See at _[[categorical model of dependent types]]_ for more on this.
