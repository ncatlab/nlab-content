## Idea

The _model structure for dendroidal complete Segal spaces_ is an [[operad|operadic]] generalization of the [[model structure for complete Segal spaces]]. It serves to [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[(∞,1)-operads]].

A _complete dendroidal Segal space_ $X$ is much like a [[dendroidal set]], only that it has for each [[tree]] $T$ not just a _set_ of [[dendrices]], but a [[simplicial set]] $X_T \in sSet$, subject to some conditions. The model structure discussed here is defined on the category of all [[simplicial presheaves]] over the [[tree category]], such that the fibrant objects are precisely the dendroidal complete Segal spaces.

## Definition

Write $\Omega$ for the [[tree category]], the [[site]] for [[dendroidal sets]]

$$
  dSet := [\Omega^{op}, Set]
  \,.
$$

Write $\otimes$ for the [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]] on [[dendroidal sets]] (see there for details).


+-- {: .num_defn #ModelStructures}
###### Definition

Let $dsSet_{genReedy} := [\Omega^{op}, sSet]$ be the category of [[dendroidal set|dendroidal]] [[simplicial sets]], equipped with the [[generalized Reedy model structure]] induced from the [[generalized Reedy category]] $\Omega$.

Write 

$$
  dsSet_{Segal}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  dsSet_{genReedy}
$$ 

for the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] at the set of [[dendroidal spine]] ("Segal core") inclusions $\{Sp[T] \to \Omega[T]\}_{T \in \Omega}$, to be called the **model structure for dendroidal Segal spaces**. 

A fibrant object in this category is called a **dendroidal Segal space**.

Write 

$$
  dsSet_{cSegal}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  dsSet_{Segal}
$$ 

for the further left Bousfield localization at the set of morphisms 
$\{\Omega[T]\otimes (J_d \to \eta) \}_{T \in \Omega, }$, where $J_d$ is the _dendroidal groupoidal interval_

$$
  J_d := 
  i_!(N(\{0 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} 1\}))
  \,.
$$

Call this the **model structure for complete dendroidal Segal spaces**. 

A fibrant object in here is called a **complete dendroidal Segal space**.

=--

This is ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, def. 5.4, def. 6.2](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .num_prop #SpineAndHornLocalization}
###### Proposition

The localization at the [[dendroidal spine]] inclusions is equivalently the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] at the set of dendroidal inner horn inclusions.

=--

This is [Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 5.5, def. 6.2](#CisinskiMoerdijk).


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the nature of left Bousfield localization, it is sufficient to show that one localizing set of morphisms is contained in the weak equivalences of the other.

In one direction, it is clear that every [[inner anodyne morphism]] of [[dendroidal sets]] is a weak equivalence in the localization at the horn inclusions.  By the discussion at _[[spine]]_, the spine inclusions are indeed inner anodyne.

Conversely, one checks that the weak equivalences generated by the spine inclusions contain all inner anodyne morphisms ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 2.8](#CisinskiMoerdijk))

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Corollas}
###### Definition

Write $\eta \in \Omega $ for the tree with a single edge and no vertex. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $C_n \in \Omega$ for the $n$-corolla, the tree with a single vertex and $n$ leaves (and the root).

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #HomSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a dendroidal Segal space, and for $(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \in (X(\eta)_0)^{n+1}$, write $X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \in sSet$ for the [[pullback]] 

$$
  \array{
    X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) &\to& X(C_n)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    *  &\stackrel{(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)}{\to}& (X(\eta))^{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #HomotopyPropertyOfHomSpaces}
###### Remark

These simplicial sets $X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)$
are [[Kan complexes]] and in fact are [[generalized the|the]] [[homotopy fibers]] of the right vertical morphism.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusion $\eta^{n+1} \to \Omega(C_n)$ is a cofibration in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$. So in this [[simplicial model category]] the right vertical morphism in def. \ref{HomSpaces} are [[Kan fibrations]]. These are stable under ordinary pullback, and their ordinary pullback is a [[homotopy pullback]] (as discussed there).

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #FullyFaithfulMorphism}
###### Definition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ between dendroidal Segal spaces  is **[[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]]** if for all
$(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \in X(\eta)^{n+1}$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the corresponding morphism

$$
  X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \to Y(f(x_1), \cdots, f(x_n); f(x))
$$

is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--


## Properties

### Basic technical properties

As for any category of [[simplicial presheaves]] we have

+-- {: .num_remark #TensoringAndEnrichment}
###### Remark

The category $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]$ is canonically [[tensoring|tensored]], [[cotensoring|cotensored]] and [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[sSet]].

The [[tensoring]] is given by the degreewise [[cartesian product]] in [[sSet]]:

$$
  \cdot : sSet \times [\Omega^{op}, sSet] \to [\Omega^{op}, sSet]
$$
$$
  (S, X) \mapsto (S \cdot X : T \mapsto S \times X(T))
  \,.
$$

For $X \in dSet$ a dendroidal set, the [[hom object]] functor restricted along $dSet \hookrightarrow [\Omega^{op}, sSet]$

$$
  X^{(-)} : dSet^{op} \to sSet
$$

is the essentially unique [[limit]]-preserving functor such that for all $T \in \Omega$

$$
  X^{\Omega[T]} = X(T)
  \,.
$$

=--

We will often write "$\times$" also for the tensoring "$\cdot$".

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The essential uniqueness in the last clause follows, because by the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] every [[dendroidal set]] $S$ may be written as a [[colimit]] over its cells

$$
  S =_{iso} {\lim_{\underset{(\Omega[T] \to S)}{\to}}} \Omega[T]
  \,.
$$

Therefore

$$
  X^S
  = 
  {\lim_{\underset{(\Omega[T] \to S)}{\leftarrow}}} X(T)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #latching}
###### Proposition

For $X \in [\Omega^{op}, sSet]$, and $T \in \Omega$, the _matching object_ of $X$ at $T$ (in the sense of [[generalized Reedy model structure]]) is 

$$
  Match_T X = X^{\partial \Omega[T]}
  \,.
$$

For $f : X \to Y$ a morphism,
the _relative matching morphism_ 

$$
  X(T) \to Match_T X \times_{Match_T Y} Y(T)
$$ 

is the universal morphism induced from the commutativity of the diagram

$$
  \array{
     X^{\Omega[T]} &\stackrel{f^{\Omega[T]}}{\to}& Y^{\Omega[T]}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X^{\partial \Omega[T]} &\stackrel{f^{\partial \Omega[T]}}{\to}& Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}     
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition

$$
  Match_T X = {\lim_{\leftarrow}}_{(T' \hookrightarrow T)} X(T')
  \,,
$$

where the limit is over faces of $T$. By remark \ref{TensoringAndEnrichment} this is 

$$
  \cdots \simeq X^{({\lim_\to}_{(T' \hookrightarrow T)} \Omega[T'])}
  \,.
$$

By the discussion at _[[dendroidal set]]_, the exponent is the boundary of the tree $T$.

Similarly one finds that the morphism $X(T) \to Match_T X$ is 

$$
  X^{\partial \Omega[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]} 
  : 
  X^{\Omega[T]} \to X^{\partial \Omega[T]}
  \,.
$$

### Fibrations and Cofibrations


+-- {: .num_prop #FibrationsInGenReedy}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $[\Delta^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration,
precisely if for all [[trees]] $T \in \Omega$, the morphism of [[hom objects]]

$$
  X^{\Omega[T]}
  \to 
  X^{\partial \Omega[T]}
   \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega{T}}}
  Y^{\Omega[T]}
$$

is a [[Kan fibration]] or [[weak homotopy equivalence|acyclic]] Kan fibration, respectively.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of _[[generalized Reedy model structure]]_ and using prop. \ref{latching}.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #CofibrantlyGenerated}
###### Proposition

The [[generalized Reedy model structure]] $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReeedy}$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with set of generating cofibrations 

$$
  I := \{\partial \Delta [n] \cdot \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n] \cdot \partial \Omega[T] \to \Delta[n] \cdot \Omega[T]\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}, T \in \Omega}
$$


and with set of acyclic generating cofibrations

$$
  J := \{\Lambda^k[n] \cdot \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n] \cdot \partial \Omega[T] \to \Delta[n] \cdot \Omega[T]\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}, T \in \Omega}
  \,.
$$

=--

The statement is ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 5.2](#CisinskiMoerdijk)). The following proof proceeds in view of remark 5.3 there.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{FibrationsInGenReedy} we have that
a morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration precisely if for all [[trees]] $T$ the canonical morphism

$$
  X^{\Omega[T]} 
   \to 
  X^{\partial \Omega[T]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}} Y^{\Omega[T]}
$$

is a [[Kan fibration]] or acyclic Kan fibration, respectively.

This means equivalently that every diagram

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^k \Delta[n] &\to& X^{\Omega[T]}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& 
    X^{\partial \Omega[T]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}} Y^{\Omega[T]}
  }
$$

or, respectively,

$$
  \array{
    \partial \Delta[n] &\to& X^{\Omega[T]}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& 
    X^{\partial \Omega[T]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}} Y^{\Omega[T]}
  }
$$

has a lift. A little reflection shows (see [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]]) that this, in turn, is equivalent to that every diagram

$$
  \array{   
    \Lambda^k[n] \times \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n]\times \partial \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    Y
  }
$$

or, respectively, 

$$
  \array{   
    \partial \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n]\times \partial \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    Y
  }
$$

has a lift. 

The statement follows by using the [[small object argument]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Being a [[category of presheaves]], $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]$ is a [[locally presentable category]]. Together with the cofibrant generation of the model structure from prop. \ref{CofibrantlyGenerated} this means that $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is a [[combinatorial model category]]. This implies that it has a good theory of [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] at sets of morphisms.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #CofibrationsAreNormalMonomorphisms}
###### Proposition

The cofibrations in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ are precisely the simplicial-degree-wise _normal monomorphisms_ of [[dendroidal sets]] (see [here](nlab/show/dendroidal%20set#NormalMonomorphisms)).

=--

This is ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, cor. 4.3](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The generating inclusions in prop. \ref{CofibrantlyGenerated} are the boundary inclusions of [[representable functor|representables]] in the product site $\Delta \times \Omega$, regarded as a Cisinski-[[generalized Reedy category]]. By the discussion [there](nlab/show/generalized%20Reedy%20category#NormalMorphisms), these generate the normal monomorphisms on $\Delta \times \Omega$. But since $\Delta$ contains no non-trivial automorphisms, this are just the degreewise dendroidal normal monomorphisms.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialEnrichment}
###### Proposition

The [[generalized Reedy model structure]] $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$
equipped with the [[sSet]]-[[enriched category|enrichment]] from remark \ref{TensoringAndEnrichment} is an [[enriched model category]] over the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] -- a _[[simplicial model category]]_.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to check the [[pushout-product axiom]] for the [[tensoring]] operation. So for $a : S \to T$ a monomorphism of [[simplicial sets]] and $ f : X \to Y$ a degreewise normal monomorphisms in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]$, we need to check, by prop \ref{CofibrationsAreNormalMonomorphisms}, that the canonical morphism

$$
  (S \cdot Y) \coprod_{(S \cdot X)} (T \cdot X) \to T \cdot Y
$$

is a simplicial-degreewise normal monomorphism, which is a weak equivalence if either of $a$ or $f$ is. Since this coproduct is computed objectwise, this morphism is over $[n] \in \Delta$ the pushout of simplicial sets

$$
  (S_n \cdot Y_n) \coprod_{(S_n \cdot X_n)} (T_n \cdot X_n) \to T_n \cdot Y_n
  \,,
$$

where now the [[tensoring]] is that of [[dendroidal sets]] over sets, which is given by [[coproduct]] of dendroidal sets, $S_n \cdot Y_n = \coprod_{s \in S_n} Y_n$. It is clear that this is a [[monomorphism]].

Moreover, the [[image]] of this morphism contains the image of $T_n \cdot f_n$, which for each summand $t \in T_n$ is the image of $f$. Therefore the [[dendrex|dendrices]] not in this image are also summand-wise not in the image of $f$, hence have trivial [[stabilizer groups]], by the assumption that $f$ is a normal monomorphism.

Finally, to see that the above morphism out of the pushout is a weak equivalence if either of $a$ or $f$ is, use that in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{fReedy}$ the weak equivalences are tree-wise those of simplicial sets. The statement then follows by $sSet_{Quillen}$ being a [[monoidal model category]] with respect to its [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal]] category structure.

=--

Some of these properties are inherited by the actual model structure for dendroidal complete Segal spaces

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

The model structures $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$ and $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}$ 

* are [[combinatorial simplicial model categories]];

* have as cofibrations precisely the simplicial-degreewise normal monomorphisms.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since cofibrations and simplicial enrichment are preserved by left Bousfield localization, this follows from the analogous statements for $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$.

=--

### Fibrant objects

+-- {: .num_remark #FillerPropertyOfFibrantObjects}
###### Remark

An object $X \in [\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is fibrant, precisely if for
every [[tree]] $T \in \Omega$, the morphism

$$
  X^{(\partial \Omega[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T])}
  : 
  X(T) \to X^{\partial \Omega[T]}
$$

is a [[Kan fibration]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{FibrationsInGenReedy}, using $Y = *$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #CompleteSegalBySpineLiftingAndHornLifting}
###### Proposition

The following conditions are equivalent

* $X \in dsSet$ is a complete dendroidal Segal space;

* for every [[spine]] inclusion $Sp[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]$, the induced morphism  $X^{\Omega[T]} \to X^{Sp[T]}$ is an acyclic Kan fibration;

* for every inner [[horn]] inclusion $\Lambda^e[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]$, the induced morphism $X^{\Omega[T]} \to X^{\Lambda^e[T]}$ is an acyclic Kan fibration.

=--

This appears as ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, cor. 5.6](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{CofibrationsAreNormalMonomorphisms} both the spine and the horn inclusion are morphisms between cofibrant objects
in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$. 
By the general properties of 
[[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] and using that $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is a [[simplicial model category]] by prop. \ref{SimplicialEnrichment}, 
it follows that a fibrant object $X \in [\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is local with respect to the spine / horn inclusions precisely if powering these into this object, remark \ref{TensoringAndEnrichment}, is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets. Since moreover the horn and spine inclusions are cofibrations, by prop. \ref{CofibrationsAreNormalMonomorphisms}, this will necessarily be an acyclic Kan fibration (by the dual of the [[pushout-product axiom]] in a [[simplicial model category]]).

=--

### Weak equivalences

+-- {: .num_prop #WEDetectedOnCorollas}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ between dendroidal Segal spaces is a weak equivalence in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$, and hence in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}$ precisely if its components on the trees $\eta$ and $C_n$ for all $n$, def. \ref{Corollas}, are [[weak homotopy equivalences]] of simplicial sets.

=--

This appears as ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 5.7](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By general properties of [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]], a morphism between [[local objects]] is a weak equivalence precisely if it is so already in the unlocalized model structure $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{genReedy}$. There the weak equivalences are the morphisms that are so over _every_ tree. But by prop. \ref{CompleteSegalBySpineLiftingAndHornLifting} these are already implied by weak equivalences over the [[spines]]. These are, finally, [[colimits]] which happen to be [[homotopy colimits]] of $\eta$ and of corollas, and hence it suffices to have weak equivalences over these components in order to have them over all components.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #WeakEquivalencesAreFullyFaithfulEssentiallySurjective}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of dendroidal Segal spaces is a weak equivalence in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$ precisely if it is

1. fully faithful, def. \ref{FullyFaithfulMorphism};

1. [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] in that $f(\eta) : X(\eta) \to Y(\eta)$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets.

=--

(See also _[[equivalence of categories]]_.)

This appears as ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, cor. 5.10](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Being essentially surjective is equivalent to $f(\eta)$ being an equivalence. By prop. \ref{WEDetectedOnCorollas} it only remains to check that in this situation $f$ being fully faithful is equivalent to $f(C_n)$ being an equivalence, for all $n$.

By remark \ref{HomotopyPropertyOfHomSpaces}, of $f(C_n) : X(C_n) \to Y(C_n)$ is a weak equivalence for all $n$ then $f$ is fully faithful, since weak equivalence are preserved by [[homotopy pullback]]. 

For the converse, 
consider for each $n$ the inclusion of _all_ input and output colors

$$
  \coprod_{(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)}
  * 
  \to
  X(\eta)^{n+1}
$$

and similarly for $Y$. Since this evidently hits all connected components of $X(\eta)^{n+1}$, it is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] in [[∞Grpd]]. These are stable under [[homotopy pullback]], and so also 

$$
  \coprod_{(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)}
  X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)
  \to
  X(C_n)
$$

is an effective epimorphism, and similarly for $Y$. If now $f$ is fully faithful, then by the definition of [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], this exhibits $f(C_n)$ as the [[homotopy colimit]] of a diagram of equivalences. Hence $f(C_n)$ is itself a weak equivalence.


=--

### Relation to other model structures

We discuss the relation to various other model structures for operads. For an overview see _[[table - models for (infinity,1)-operads]]_.


#### To complete Segal spaces

Write $\eta \in \Omega \hookrightarrow dSet \hookrightarrow dsSet$ for the [[tree]] with a single edge and no non-trivial vertex. 

Then [[slice category]] of $dsSet$ over $\eta$ is evidently equivalent to that of [[bisimplicial sets]]

$$
  ssSet \simeq dsSet_{/\eta} 
  \hookrightarrow
  dsSet
  \,.
$$

By restriction along this inclusion, the 
above model structure reproduces the
[[model structure for complete Segal spaces]].

#### To dendroidal sets / quasi-operads

The model structure for dendroidal complete Segal spaces is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the [[model structure on dendroidal sets]], whose fibrant objects are the "quasi-operads" (the operadic generalization of [[quasi-categories]]).
 
We discuss in fact two Quillen equivalences, with right adjoints going in both directions:

1. [From quasi-operads to dendroidal complete Segal spaces](#QuasiOperadsToDendroidalCompleteSegal)

   $$
      ({|-|_J} \dashv Sing_J) : 
      dSet_{CM}
       \stackrel{\overset{{|-|_J}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{{Sing_j}}{\to}}
      [\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}
      \,.
   $$

1. [From dendroidal complete Segal spaces to quasi-operads](#DendroidalSegalSpacesToQuasiOperads)

   $$
     (i  \dashv )
     [\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}   
       \stackrel{\overset{i}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{}{\to}}
     dSet
   $$

##### Quasi-operads to dendroidal complete Segal spaces
 {#QuasiOperadsToDendroidalCompleteSegal}

Recall from _[[complete Segal space]]_ the basic example _[Categories as complete Segal spaces](complete+Segal+space#OrdinaryCategoriesAsCompleteSegalSpaces)_ which shows how an ordinary [[small category]] $C$ is regarded as a [[complete Segal space]] $Sing_J(C)$ by setting

$$
  Sing_J(C) : n \mapsto N(Core(C^{\Delta[n]}))
  \,.
$$

Recall also that this and its generalization to _[Complete Segal spaces of quasi-categories](complete+Segal+space#QuasiCategoriesAsCompleteSegal)_, amounts to simply forming a double-nerve with respect to the invertible interval object. We consider here the operadic generalization of this construction.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First we show that ${\vert -\vert_J}$ is a [[left Quillen functor]]. Since $dSet_{CM}$ is a [[monoidal model category]], it follows from the [[pushout-product axiom]] in $(dSet_{CM}, \otimes_{BV})$ that ${\vert -\vert_J}$ sends the generating (acyclic) cofibrations of $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Reedy}$ from prop. \ref{CofibrantlyGenerated} to (acyclic) cofibrations in $dSet_{CM}$. Since the cofibrations of $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}$ are the same as those of $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Reedy}$, it is sufficient to see that ${\vert -\vert_J}$ sends the morphisms that define the localization, def. \ref{ModelStructures}, to weak equivalences in $dSet_{CM}$. But since these moprhisms are in the image of the inclusion $dSet \hookrightarrow [\Omega^{op}, sSet]$, the functor indeed sends them to themselves, and they are indeed weak equibalences in $dSet_{CM}$ (since all inner [[anodyne morphisms]] are -- this gives that $\Lambda^e[T] \to \Omega[T]$ is a weak equivalence -- and all equivalences in the [[canonical model structure on operads]] are -- this gives that $\Omega[T] \otimes_{BV} J \to \Omega[T]$ is).

So far this shows that ${\vert - \vert_J}$ is left Quillen. To see that it is a Quillen equivalence, use that its composition with the left Quillen functor $i : dSet_{CM} \to [\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ discussed in the [companion section](#DendroidalSegalSpacesToQuasiOperads) is evidently a Quillen equivalence.

The inclusion

###### Proposition

Under the canonical identification of categories

$$
  [\Delta^{op}, dSet] \simeq [\Omega^{op}, Set]
$$

the two model structures $[\Delta^{op}, dSet_{CM}]_{LocConst}$,
def. \ref{LocallyConstantModelStructure} and $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}$,
def. \ref{ModelStructures}, coincide.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a standard fact (see at _[[model category]]_ the section _[Redundancy of the axioms](#spring)_) it is sufficient to show that the cofibrations and the fibrant objects coincide.

By prop. \ref{CofibrantlyGenerated} we know the generating cofibrations of
$[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}$. By the same kind of argument we find the cofibrations of $[\Delta^{op}, dSet]_{Reedy}$, and hence of
$[\Delta^{op}, dSet]_{LocConst}$: 

by definition of [[Reedy model structure]], a morphism $f : X \to Y$ here is an _acyclic fibration_ if for all $n \in \Delta$ the morphism

$$
  X^{\Delta[n]} \to X^{\partial \Delta[n]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Delta[n]}} Y^{\Delta[n]}
$$

is an acyclic fibration in $dSet_{CM}$. Since $dSet_{CM}$ has generating cofibrations given by the set of tree boundary inclusions $\{\partial \Omega[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]\}_{T \in \Omega}$, one finds as in the proof of prop. \ref{CofibrantlyGenerated} that $f : X \to Y$ is an acyclic fibration precisely if it has the right lifting property against the morphisms in the set

$$
  \{
    \partial \Delta[n] \cdot \Omega[T]
    \cup
    \Delta[n] \cdot \partial \Omega[T]
    \to
    \Delta[n] \cdot \Omega[T]
  \}_{n \in \Delta, T \in \Omega}
  \,.
$$

Therefore the cofibrations in the two model structures do coincide.

(Notice that a similar statement holds for the acyclic cofibrations, only that the generating set of acyclic cofibrations in $dSet_{CM}$ is, while known to exist, not known explicitly.)

Next, to see that the fibrant objects also coincide.

Let $X$ be fibrant in $[\Delta^{op}, [\Omega^{op}, Set]_{CM}]_{Reedy}$. Then 
it is also fibrant in $[\Delta^{op}, [\Omega^{op}, Set]_{CM}]_{proj}$. 
 
We compute $RHom(\Delta[n] \times \Omega[T], X)$ by forming a fibrant resolution 
of 
$X$ in $[\Delta^{op},[\Delta^{op}, [\Omega^{op}, Set]_{CM}]_{proj}]_{Reedy}$.
We claim that such is given by

$$
  [n] \mapsto X^{(\Delta[n])}
  \,.
$$

Because this is Reedy fibrant precisely if for all $n$ the morphism

$$
 X^{(\Delta[n])} \to X^{(\partial \Delta[n])}
$$

is fibrant in $[\Delta^{op}, [\Omega^{op}, Set]_{CM}]_{proj}$, which is the case if for all $k \in \Delta$ the morphism 

$$
  X^{(\Delta[n])}_k \to X^{(\partial \Delta[n])}_k
$$

is a fibration in $dSet_{CM}$. But that is the case.
Moreover, $\Delta[n]\cdot \Omega[T]$ is cofibrant in 
$[\Delta^{op}, [\Omega^{op}, Set]_{CM}]_{proj}$. So we may compute the derived hom
as

$$
  RHom(\Delta[n]\times \Omega[T], X)
  :
  [k]
  \mapsto
  Hom( \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T], X^{(\Delta[k])} )
  = 
  Hom(\Omega[T], X^{(\Delta[k])}_n)
  \,.
$$

This last expression, now, also gives $RHom(\Omega[T], X_n)$.

So it follows that (...)
