## Idea

The _model structure for dendroidal complete Segal spaces_ is an [[operad|operadic]] generalization of the [[model structure for complete Segal spaces]]. It serves to [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[(∞,1)-operads]].

## Definition

Write $\Omega$ for the [[tree category]], the [[site]] for [[dendroidal sets]]

$$
  dSet := [\Omega^{op}, Set]
  \,.
$$

Write $\otimes$ for the [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]] on [[dendroidal sets]] (see there for details).


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $dsSet_{genReedy} := [\Omega^{op}, sSet]$ be the category of [[dendroidal set|dendroidal]] [[simplicial sets]], equipped with the [[generalized Reedy model structure]] induced from the [[generalized Reedy category]] $\Omega$.

Write 

$$
  dsSet_{Segal}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  dsSet_{genReedy}
$$ 

for the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] at the set of [[dendroidal spine]] ("Segal core") inclusions $\{Sp[T] \to \Omega[T]\}_{T \in \Omega}$, to be called the **model structure for dendroidal Segal spaces**. 

A fibrant object in this category is called a **dendroidal Segal space**.

Write 

$$
  dsSet_{cSegal}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  dsSet_{Segal}
$$ 

for the further left Bousfield localization at the set of morphisms 
$\{\Omega[T]\otimes (J_d \to \eta) \}_{T \in \Omega, }$, where $J_d$ is the _dendroidal interval_

$$
  J_d := 
  i_!(N(\tau(\Delta[1])))
  \,.
$$

Call this the **model structure for complete dendroidal Segal spaces**. 

A fibrant object in here is called a **complete dendroidal Segal space**.

=--

This is ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, def. 5.4, def. 6.2](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .num_prop #SpineAndHornLocalization}
###### Proposition

The localization at the [[dendroidal spine]] inclusions is equivalently the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] at the set of dendroidal inner horn inclusions.

=--

By the propositions discussed at _[[spine]]_.

This is [Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 5.5, def. 6.2](#CisinskiMoerdijk).

+-- {: .num_defn #Corollas}
###### Definition

Write $\eta \in \Omega $ for the tree with a single edge and no vertex. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $C_n \in \Omega$ for the $n$-corolla, the tree with a single vertex and $n$ leaves (and the root).

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #HomSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a dendroidal Segal space, and for $(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \in (X(\eta)_0)^{n+1}$, write $X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \in sSet$ for the [[pullback]] 

$$
  \array{
    X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) &\to& X(C_n)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    *  &\stackrel{(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)}{\to}& (X(\eta))^{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #HomotopyPropertyOfHomSpaces}
###### Remark

These simplicial sets $X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)$
are [[Kan complexes]] and in fact are [[generalized the|the]] [[homotopy fibers]] of the right vertical morphism.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusion $\eta^{n+1} \to \Omega(C_n)$ is a cofibration in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$. So in this [[simplicial model category]] the right vertical morphism in def. \ref{HomSpaces} are [[Kan fibrations]]. These are stable under ordinary pullback, and their ordinary pullback is a [[homotopy pullback]] (as discussed there).

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #FullyFaithfulMorphism}
###### Definition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ between dendroidal Segal spaces  is **[[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]]** if for all
$(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \in X(\eta)^{n+1}$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the corresponding morphism

$$
  X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x) \to Y(f(x_1), \cdots, f(x_n); f(x))
$$

is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--


## Properties

### Fibrant objects

+-- {: .num_prop #CompleteSegalBySpineLiftingAndHornLifting}
###### Proposition

The following conditions are equivalent

* $X \in dsSet$ is a complete dendroidal Segal space;

* for every [[spine]] inclusion $Sp[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]$, the induced morphism  $X^{\Omega[T]} \to X^{Sp[T]}$ is an acyclic Kan fibration;

* for every inner [[horn]] inclusion $\Lambda^e[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]$, the induced morphism $X^{\Omega[T]} \to X^{\Lambda^e[T]}$ is an acyclic Kan fibration.

=--

This appears as ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, cor. 5.6](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is a direct consequence of the nature of [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] and prop. \ref{SpineAndHornLocalization}: according to this both the spin and the horn inclusion are acyclic cofibrations. Moreover $X$ is fibrant. Finally $dsSet_{cSegal}$ is a [[simplicial model category]], which implies the claim by the dual of the [[pushout-product axiom]]. 

=--

### Weak equivalences

+-- {: .num_prop #WEDetectedOnCorollas}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ between dendroidal Segal spaces is a weak equivalence in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$, and hence in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{cSegal}$ precisely if its components on the trees $\eta$ and $C_n$ for all $n$, def. \ref{Corollas}, are [[weak homotopy equivalences]] of simplicial sets.

=--

This appears as ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 5.7](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By general properties of [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]], a morphism between [[local objects]] is a weak equivalence precisely if it is so already in the unlocalized model structure $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{genReedy}$. There the weak equivalences are the morphisms that are so over _every_ tree. But by prop. \ref{CompleteSegalBySpineLiftingAndHornLifting} these are already implied by weak equivalences over the [[spines]]. These are, finally, [[colimits]] which happen to be [[homotopy colimits]] of $\eta$ and of corollas, and hence it suffices to have weak equivalences over these components in order to have them over all components.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of dendroidal Segal spaces is a weak equivalence in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{Segal}$ precisely if it is

1. fully faithful, def. \ref{FullyFaithfulMorphism};

1. [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] in that $f(\eta) : X(\eta) \to Y(\eta)$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets.

=--

(See also _[[equivalence of categories]]_.)

This appears as ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, cor. 5.10](#CisinskiMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Being essentially surjective is equivalent to $f(\eta)$ being an equivalence. By prop. \ref{WEDetectedOnCorollas} it only remains to check that in this situation $f$ being fully faithful is equivalent to $f(C_n)$ being an equivalence, for all $n$.

By remark \ref{HomotopyPropertyOfHomSpaces}, of $f(C_n) : X(C_n) \to Y(C_n)$ is a weak equivalence for all $n$ then $f$ is fully faithful, since weak equivalence are preserved by [[homotopy pullback]]. 

For the converse, 
consider for each $n$ the inclusion of _all_ input and output colors

$$
  \coprod_{(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)}
  * 
  \to
  X(\eta)^{n+1}
$$

and similarly for $Y$. Since this evidently hits all connected components of $X(\eta)^{n+1}$, it is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] in [[∞Grpd]]. These are stable under [[homotopy pullback]], and so also 

$$
  \coprod_{(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)}
  X(x_1, \cdots, x_n; x)
  \to
  X(C_n)
$$

is an effective epimorphism, and similarly for $Y$. If now $f$ is fully faithful, then by the definition of [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], this exhibits $f(C_n)$ as the [[homotopy colimit]] of a diagram of equivalences. Hence $f(C_n)$ is itself a weak equivalence.


=--

### Fibrations and Cofibrations

First some standard technical preliminaries.

As for any category of [[simplicial presheaves]] we have

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$[\Omega^{op}, sSet]$ is canonically [[tensoring|tensored]], [[cotensoring|cotensored]] and [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[sSet]].

The [[tensoring]] is given by the degreewise [[cartesian product]] in [[sSet]]:

$$
  \cdot : sSet \times [\Omega^{op}, sSet] \to [\Omega^{op}, sSet]
$$
$$
  (S, X) \mapsto (S \cdot X : T \mapsto S \times X(T))
  \,.
$$

For $X \in dSet$ a dendroidal set, the [[hom object]] functor

$$
  X^{(-)} : dSet^{op} \to sSet
$$

is the essentially unique [[limit]]-preserving functor such that for all $T \in \Omega$

$$
  X^{(\Omega[T])} = X(T)
  \,.
$$

=--

We will often write "$\times$" also for the tensoring "$\cdot$".

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The essential uniqueness in the last clause follows, because by the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] every [[dendroidal set]] $S$ may be written as a [[colimit]] over its cells

$$
  S =_{iso} {\lim_{\to}}_{\Omega[T] \to S} \Omega[T]
  \,.
$$

Therefore

$$
  X^S
  = 
  {\lim_\leftarrow}_{\Omega[T] \to S} X(T)
  \,.
$$


=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $[\Delta^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is a fibration,
precisely if for all [[trees]] $T \in \Omega$

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[generalized Reedy model structure]] $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReeedy}$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with set of generating cofibrations 

$$
  I := \{\partial \Delta [n] \cdot \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n] \cdot \partial \Omega[T] \to \Delta[n] \cdot \Omega[T]\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}, T \in \Omega}
$$


and with set of acyclic generating cofibrations

$$
  J := \{\Lambda^k[n] \cdot \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n] \cdot \partial \Omega[T] \to \Delta[n] \cdot \Omega[T]\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}, T \in \Omega}
  \,.
$$

=--

The statement is ([Cisinski-Moerdijk, prop. 5.2](#CisinskiMoerdijk)). The followong proof follows remark 5.3 there.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the general definition of [[generalized Reedy model structure]] we have that
a morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $[\Omega^{op}, sSet]_{gReedy}$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration precisely if for all [[trees]] $T$ the canonical morphism

$$
  X^{\Omega[T]} 
   \to 
  X^{\partial \Omega[T]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}} Y^{\Omega[T]}
$$

is a [[Kan fibration]] or acyclic Kan fibration, respectively.

This means equivalently that every diagram

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^k \Delta[n] &\to& X^{\Omega[T]}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& 
    X^{\partial \Omega[T]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}} Y^{\Omega[T]}
  }
$$

or, respectively,

$$
  \array{
    \partial \Delta[n] &\to& X^{\Omega[T]}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& 
    X^{\partial \Omega[T]} \times_{Y^{\partial \Omega[T]}} Y^{\Omega[T]}
  }
$$

has a lift. A little reflection shows that this, in turn, is equivalent to that every diagram

$$
  \array{   
    \Lambda^k[n] \times \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n]\times \partial \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    Y
  }
$$

or, respectively, 

$$
  \array{   
    \partial \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T] \cup \Delta[n]\times \partial \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \Delta[n] \times \Omega[T]
    &\to&
    Y
  }
$$

has a lift. 

The statement follows by using the [[small object argument]].

### Relation to other model structures

We discuss the relation to various other model structures for operads. For an overview see _[[table - models for (infinity,1)-operads]]_.


#### To complete Segal spaces

Write $\eta \in \Omega \hookrightarrow dSet \hookrightarrow dsSet$ for the [[tree]] with a single edge and no non-trivial vertex. 

Then [[slice category]] of $dsSet$ over $\eta$ is evidently equivalent to that of [[bisimplicial sets]]

$$
  ssSet \simeq dsSet_{/\eta} 
  \hookrightarrow
  dsSet
  \,.
$$

By restriction along this inclusion, the 
above model structure reproduces the
[[model structure for complete Segal spaces]].
