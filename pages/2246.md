A [[field]] (in the sense of [[commutative algebra]]) $F$ is **perfect** if every [[algebraic extension]] of $F$ is [[separable extension|separable]]. For example, all fields of characteristic zero are perfect, as are all finite fields, and all algebraically closed fields, and all extensions of perfect fields. 

An example of a field that isn't perfect is the field of rational functions over a finite field.
