## Idea

In [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the [[brane]] electrically charged under the [[supergravity C-field]] is the [[M2-brane]]/[[membrane]]. The dual under [[electric-magnetic duality]] is the M5-brane.

## Properties

### Worldvolume theory

the [[worldvolume]] theory of the M5-brane is the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]].

This [[worldvolume]] theory involves [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of the [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] kind ([Witten07](#Witten07), [Witten09](#Witten09)): the fields are supposed to be [[connections on a 2-bundle]]($\sim$ [[gerbe]]), presumably with structure [[2-group]] the [[automorphism 2-group]] $AUT(G)$ of some [[Lie group]] $G$. 

For instance in the proposal of ([SSW11](#SSW11)) one sees in equation (2.1) _almost_ the data of an $\mathfrak{aut}(\mathfrak{g})$-[[2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms|Lie 2-algebra valued forms]].


### Dimensional reduction

On dimensional reduction of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a circle the M5-brane turns into the [[NS5-brane]] and the [[D-brane|D4-brane]] of [[type II string theory]].

### Holographic dual

The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] for the 5-brane is $AdS_7/CFT_6$ and relates the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] to [[7-dimensional supergravity]] obtained by [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|reduction]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on o 4-[[sphere]] to an and asymptotically 7d [[anti de Sitter spacetime]].

### Conformal blocks and 7d Chern-Simons dual
 {#7dCSDual}

The [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-dual 2-connection]]-field (see there for more details) on the 6-dimensional [[worldvolume]] M5-brane is supposed to have a [[holographic principle|holographic]] description in terms of a [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] ([Witten 1996](#Witten96)). We discuss the relevant "fractional" [[quadratic form]] on [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that defines the correct [[action functional]].

Let $\hat G$ be the [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]] on a 7-dimensional manifold $X$ with boundary the M5-brane, thought of as the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]] down to [[7-dimensional supergravity]].

As discussed there, the [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] [[action functional]] on these 3-connections is

$$
  \hat G_4 \mapsto
  \exp(i \int_X \hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4)
  \,,
$$

where 

* $\exp(i \int_X (-))$ is the [[higher holonomy]] / [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]] from $X$ to the point

* of the [[Beilinson-Deligne cup product]] [[circle n-bundle with connection|7-connection]] $\hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4$.

The space of [[states]] of this 7d theory on the M5 worldvolume $\partial X$ would be the space of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]].

Except, that it turns out that the [[first Chern class]] of the corresponding [[prequantum line bundle]] is _twice_ that required from [[geometric quantization]].

Therefore the above action functional is not yet the correct one, but only a fractional version of it is. However, the class $G_4 \cup G_4$ in [[integral cohomology]] has in general no reason to be divisible by 2.

This is related to the fact that as a [[quadratic form]] on the [[ordinary differential cohomology]] group $\hat H^4(X)$, the above is not a [[quadratic refinement]] of 

$$
  (\hat G, \hat G') \mapsto \exp(i \int_X \hat G \cup \hat G') 
  \,,
$$

but of twice that. In ([Witten 1996]{#Witten96}) it was argued, and later clarified in ([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)), that instead the action functional should be replaced by a proper [[quadratic refinement]].

This is accomplished by shifting the center of the [[quadratic form]]
by a lift $\lambda \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of the degree-4 [[Wu class]] $\nu_4 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ from 0 to $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$. 

(For that to make sense in [[integral cohomology]], either the [[Wu class]] $\lambda$ happens to be divisible by 2 on $X$, or else one has to regard it itself as a twisted differential character of sorts, as explained in ([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)). For the moment we will assume that $X$ is such that $\lambda$ is divisbible by 2.)

Since $X$, being a [[spacetime]] for [[supergravity]], admits (and is thought to be equipped with) a [[spin structure]], by the discussion at [[Wu class]] it follows that $\lambda$ is the [[first fractional Pontryagin class]] $\frac{1}{2}p_1$

$$
  (\frac{1}{2}p_1 \; mod \; 2) 
   \; 
     =
   \; 
   \nu_4 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}/2)
  \,.
$$

By the very definition of [[Wu class]], it follows that for any $\hat \alpha \in \hat H^4(X)$ the combination

$$
  \hat \alpha \cup \hat \alpha + \hat \alpha \cup \hat \lambda = Sq^4(\hat \alpha) - \hat \alpha \cup \hat \lambda
  \; =\;  0 \;  mod  \; 2
$$

is divisible by 2.

Therefore define then the modified quadratic form

$$
  \exp(i S) 
   \; : \; 
  \hat a \mapsto \exp i \int_X 
  \frac{1}{2}
  \left(
    \hat a \cup \hat a
    + 
    \hat a \cup \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}
  \right)
$$

(see [[differential string structure]] for the definition of the differential refinement $\hat \mathbf{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$),
where, note, we have included a factor of 2, which is possible due to the inclusion of the integral lift of the [[Wu class]].

Notice that where the [[equations of motion]] of the original [[action functional]] are $\hat a = 0$, those of this shifted one are $\hat a = - \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}$. One therefore also calls $-\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ here a _background [[charge]]_ for the 7-d Chern-Simons theory.

This is now indeed a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]]:

$$
  \exp i \left( 
    S\left(\hat a + \hat b \right)
    - 
    S\left( \hat a \right)
    - 
    S\left( \hat b \right)
    + 
    S\left( 0 \right)
  \right)
  = 
  \exp i \int_X ( \hat a \cup \hat b  )
  \,.
$$

To express the correct action functional for the 7d Chern-Simons theory it is useful to define the shifted [[supergravity C-field]]

$$
  \hat a  := \hat G_4 - \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}
  \,,
$$

which the object whose [[equations of motion]] with respect to the 7d Chern-Simons theory are still $\hat a = 0$.

Then in terms of the original $\hat G_4$ the action functional for the [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7d Chern-Simons theory]] reads

$$
  \exp(i S(\hat G_4))
  = 
  \exp(i \int_X
    \frac{1}{2}
    (
      \hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4  
      -
      (\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda})^2
    )
  )
  \,.
$$

This is the action as it appears in ([Witten96, (3.6)](#Witten96)).

In terms of [[twisted differential c-structures]] we may summarize the outcome of this reasoning as follows:

_The divisibility of the action functional requires a $2(G_4 - a)$-[[twisted Wu structure]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$-cohomology. Its lift to integral cohomology is the $2(G_4 - a)$-[[twisted differential string structure]] known as the "Witten quantization condition" on the [[supergravity C-field]]_.
