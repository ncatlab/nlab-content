## Idea

In [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the [[brane]] electrically charged under the [[supergravity C-field]] is the [[M2-brane]]/[[membrane]]. The dual under [[electric-magnetic duality]] is the M5-brane.

## Definition

### As a Green-Schwarz type sigma-model

As a [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]]: [BLNPST 97](#BLNPST97)

### As a black $p$-brane

As a [[black brane]] solution of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the M5-brane is given ([Gueven 92](#Gueven92)) by the [[spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{5,1} \times (\mathbb{R}^5-\{0\})$ with [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] given by

$$
  g = H^{-1/3} g_{\mathbb{R}^{5,1}} \oplus H^{2/3} g_{\mathbb{R}^5-\{0\}}
$$

for $H = 1 + \frac{1}{r}$ and $r$ the distance in $\mathbb{R}^5$ from the origin, and with [[field strength]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] being

$$
  F = \star_{\mathbb{R}^5} \mathbf{d}H
  \,.
$$

This is a $1/2$-[[BPS state]] of 11-dimensional supergravity.

The [[near horizon geometry]] of this spacetime is [[anti de Sitter spacetime|AdS7]]$\times$[[4-sphere|S4]]. For more on this see at _[[AdS-CFT]]_.

[[!include black branes in supergravity -- table]]


## Properties

### Worldvolume theory

the [[worldvolume]] theory of the M5-brane is the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]].

This [[worldvolume]] theory involves [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of the [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] kind ([Witten07](#Witten07), [Witten09](#Witten09)): the fields are supposed to be [[connections on a 2-bundle]]($\sim$ [[gerbe]]), presumably with structure [[2-group]] the [[automorphism 2-group]] $AUT(G)$ of some [[Lie group]] $G$. 

For instance in the proposal of ([SSW11](#SSW11)) one sees in equation (2.1) _almost_ the data of an $\mathfrak{aut}(\mathfrak{g})$-[[2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms|Lie 2-algebra valued forms]].

### Branes inside the M5

The M5-brane admits two solitonic excitations ($p$-branes within branes)

* $p = 1$: the [[self-dual string]]

* $p = 3$: the [[3-brane in 6d]] (see there for more)


### Dimensional reduction

On [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|dimensional reduction]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a circle the M5-brane turns into the [[NS5-brane]] and the [[D-brane|D4-brane]] of [[type II string theory]].

The [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the 5-brane on a [[Riemann surface]] yields as [[worldvolume]] [[theory (physics)|theory]] [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]. See at _[N=2 D=4 SYM -- Construction by compactification of 5-branes](N%3D2+D%3D4+super+Yang-Mills+theory#ConstructionByCompactificationOf5Branes)_.

### Holographic dual

The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] for the 5-brane is $AdS_7/CFT_6$ and relates the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] to [[7-dimensional supergravity]] obtained by [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|reduction]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on o 4-[[sphere]] to an and asymptotically 7d [[anti de Sitter spacetime]].

### Conformal blocks and 7d Chern-Simons dual
 {#7dCSDual}

The [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-dual 2-connection]]-field (see there for more details) on the 6-dimensional [[worldvolume]] M5-brane is supposed to have a [[holographic principle|holographic]] description in terms of a [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] ([Witten 1996](#Witten96)). We discuss the relevant "fractional" [[quadratic form]] on [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that defines the correct [[action functional]].

Let $\hat G$ be the [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]] on a 7-dimensional manifold $X$ with boundary the M5-brane, thought of as the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]] down to [[7-dimensional supergravity]].

As discussed there, the [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] [[action functional]] on these 3-connections is

$$
  \hat G_4 \mapsto
  \exp(i \int_X \hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4)
  \,,
$$

where 

* $\exp(i \int_X (-))$ is the [[higher holonomy]] / [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]] from $X$ to the point

* of the [[Beilinson-Deligne cup product]] [[circle n-bundle with connection|7-connection]] $\hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4$.

The space of [[states]] of this 7d theory on the M5 worldvolume $\partial X$ would be the space of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]].

Except, that it turns out that the [[first Chern class]] of the corresponding [[prequantum line bundle]] is _twice_ that required from [[geometric quantization]].

Therefore the above action functional is not yet the correct one, but only a fractional version of it is. However, the class $G_4 \cup G_4$ in [[integral cohomology]] has in general no reason to be divisible by 2.

This is related to the fact that as a [[quadratic form]] on the [[ordinary differential cohomology]] group $\hat H^4(X)$, the above is not a [[quadratic refinement]] of 

$$
  (\hat G, \hat G') \mapsto \exp(i \int_X \hat G \cup \hat G') 
  \,,
$$

but of twice that. In ([Witten 1996]{#Witten96}) it was argued, and later clarified in ([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)), that instead the action functional should be replaced by a proper [[quadratic refinement]].

This is accomplished by shifting the center of the [[quadratic form]]
by a lift $\lambda \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of the degree-4 [[Wu class]] $\nu_4 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ from 0 to $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$. 

(For that to make sense in [[integral cohomology]], either the [[Wu class]] $\lambda$ happens to be divisible by 2 on $X$, or else one has to regard it itself as a twisted differential character of sorts, as explained in ([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)). For the moment we will assume that $X$ is such that $\lambda$ is divisbible by 2.)

Since $X$, being a [[spacetime]] for [[supergravity]], admits (and is thought to be equipped with) a [[spin structure]], by the discussion at [[Wu class]] it follows that $\lambda$ is the [[first fractional Pontryagin class]] $\frac{1}{2}p_1$

$$
  (\frac{1}{2}p_1 \; mod \; 2) 
   \; 
     =
   \; 
   \nu_4 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}/2)
  \,.
$$

By the very definition of [[Wu class]], it follows that for any $\hat \alpha \in \hat H^4(X)$ the combination

$$
  \hat \alpha \cup \hat \alpha + \hat \alpha \cup \hat \lambda = Sq^4(\hat \alpha) - \hat \alpha \cup \hat \lambda
  \; =\;  0 \;  mod  \; 2
$$

is divisible by 2.

Therefore define then the modified quadratic form

$$
  \exp(i S^\lambda) 
   \; : \; 
  \hat a \mapsto \exp i \int_X 
  \frac{1}{2}
  \left(
    \hat a \cup \hat a
    + 
    \hat a \cup \hat \mathbf{\lambda}
  \right)
$$

(see [[differential string structure]] for the definition of the differential refinement $\hat \mathbf{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$),
where, note, we have included a global factor of 2, which is now possible due to the inclusion of the integral lift of the Wu class.

Notice that where the [[equations of motion]] of the original [[action functional]] are $\hat a = 0$, those of this shifted one are $\hat a = - \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}$. One may therefor calls $-\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ here a _background [[charge]]_ for the 7-d Chern-Simons theory.

This is now indeed a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]]:

$$
  \exp i \left( 
    S^\lambda\left(\hat a + \hat b \right)
    - 
    S^\lambda\left( \hat a \right)
    - 
    S^\lambda\left( \hat b \right)
    + 
    S^\lambda\left( 0 \right)
  \right)
  = 
  \exp i \int_X ( \hat a \cup \hat b  )
  \,.
$$

To express the correct action functional for the 7d Chern-Simons theory it is useful to define the shifted [[supergravity C-field]]

$$
  \hat a  := \hat G_4 - \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda}
  \,,
$$

which the object whose [[equations of motion]] with respect to the 7d Chern-Simons theory are still $\hat a = 0$.

Then in terms of the original $\hat G_4$ the action functional for the [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7d Chern-Simons theory]] reads

$$
  \exp(i S(\hat G_4))
  = 
  \exp(i \int_X
    \frac{1}{2}
    (
      \hat G_4 \cup \hat G_4  
      -
      (\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{\lambda})^2
    )
  )
  \,.
$$

This is the action as it appears in ([Witten96, (3.6)](#Witten96)).

In terms of [[twisted differential c-structures]] we may summarize the outcome of this reasoning as follows:

_The divisibility of the action functional requires a $2(G_4 - a)$-[[twisted Wu structure]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$-cohomology. Its lift to integral cohomology is the $2(G_4 - a)$-[[twisted differential string structure]] known as the "Witten quantization condition" on the [[supergravity C-field]]_.

### Restriction of the supergravity $C$-field
 {#RestrictionOfTheCField}

We discuss the conditions on the 
restriction of the [[supergravity C-field]] on the ambient 
[[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[spacetime]] to the M5-brane.

This is similar to the analogous situation in [[type II string theory]].
The the [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] condition demands that
the restriction of the [[B-field]] $\hat H_3 \hat H^3(X)$ 
on spacetime $X$ to an 
[[orientation|oriented]] [[D-brane]] $Q \hookrightarrow X$ has
to trivialize, up to [[torsion]], relative to the integral 
[[Stiefel-Whitney class]] $W_3 = \beta(w_2)$, where
$\beta$ is the [[Bockstein homomorphism]] induced from the 
[[short exact sequence]] $\mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}
\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2$:

$$
  H_3|_Q \simeq W_3
  \,,
$$

thus defining a [[twisted spin^c-structure]] on the [[D-brane]].

The analog of this for the M5-brane is discussed in 
([Witten00, section 5](#Witten2000)). There it is argued that
there is a class 

$$
  \theta \in H^3(Q, U(1))
$$

on the 5-brane such that under the [[Bockstein homomorphism]]
$\beta'$ induced by the [[short exact sequence]]
$\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \to U(1)$ we have for the
[[supergravity C-field]] $\hat G \in \hat H^4(X)$ the condition

$$
  G|_Q = \beta'(\theta)
  \,.
$$

By the [above](#7dCSDual) quantization condition, this may also be thought of
as witnessing a [[twisted string structure]] on the 5-brane ([Sati](#Sati10)).

This condition reduces to the above one for the $B$-field under [[double dimensional reduction]] on the circle.
