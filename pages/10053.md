## Idea

In the broad sense of the word _constructive quantum field theory_ refers to the mathematically rigorous construction of full (i.e. [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]]) [[quantum field theories]]. More specifically the term has come to be used mainly for attempts to rigorously construct [[path integral]] [[measures]] for [[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]] Euclidean field theories on [[Minkowski spacetime]] ([Jaffe](#Jaffe)). This approach has led to a construction of [[scalar field theory]] in spacetime dimension 3, and Yang-Mills theory on a four-dimensional torus.

While a mathematically rigorous construction of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is given by [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[perturbative AQFT]], construction of [[non-perturbative quantum field theories]] has remained by and large elusive, except for toy example of [[free field theories]] or low [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] (e.g. [[2d CFTs]] or [[scalar field theory]] in 3d) or [[topological quantum field theories]]. In fact the non-perturbative [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]([[QCD]]) in 4d is listed as one of the open "Millenium Problems" by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

It might be noteworthy that for the established rigorous construction of [[perturbative QFT]] via [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[perturbative AQFT]] a) the [[path integral]] or any [[measures]] that could go with it plays no role at all (instead the [[causal additivity]] of the [[S-matrix]] is axiomatized directly) and b) the construction is a [[formal deformation quantization]] ([Collini 16](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Collini16)). This might suggest that rigorous construction of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] ought to analogously proceed via [[strict deformation quantization]].
