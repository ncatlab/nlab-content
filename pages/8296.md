## Idea

The notion of _$\infty$-group extension_ generalizes the notion of [[group extension]] to [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]] and from [[groups]] to [[∞-groups]]. It is also a generalization to [[nonabelian cohomology]] of the shifted group extensions that are classified by [[Ext]]-groups.

Under forming [[loop space objects]], $\infty$-group extensions are the special case of [[principal ∞-bundles]] whose base space is the [[moduli ∞-stack]] of the group being extended.

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{H}$ an [[(∞,1)-topos]] and $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ an [[∞-group]] with [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$. Then for $A$ an abelian ([[E-∞ algebra|E-∞]]) [[∞-group]] and $n \in \mathbf{N}$ an extension of $G$ by $A$ in degree $n$ is sequence of $\infty$-groups 

$$
  \mathbf{B}^{n-1} A \to \hat G \to A
$$

such that this arises as the [[loop space object|looping]] of a [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{B}^n A
     &
     \stackrel{\Omega \mathbf{c}}{\to}
     &
     \mathbf{B}\hat G
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && \mathbf{B}G
     &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to}&
     \mathbf{B}^{n+1}A
     \,.
  }
$$

hence, by the discussion there, of a $\mathbf{B}^n A$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] over $\mathbf{B}G$.

## Properties

By the main classification result at _[[principal ∞-bundles]]_, the [[∞-groupoid]] of $\infty$-group extensions is equivalent to

$$
  \mathbf{Ext}^n(G, A)
  \coloneqq
  \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}^{n+1}A)
  \,.
$$

In particular they are classified by the intrinsic $n+1$st $A$-[[cohomology]] of $\mathbf{B}G$.

## Examples

* For $\mathbf{H} = Sh_\infty(C)$ the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on some [[site]] $C$ the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] embeds [[chain complexes]] of [[abelian sheaves]] over $C$ into $\mathbf{H}$. Under this embedding ordinary [[Ext]]-groups and the shifted extensions that they classify (see [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Ext#RelationToGroupExtensions)) identify with $\infty$-group extensions in the above sense.
 
* The [[string 2-group]] is an extension in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of the [[spin group]] by the [[circle 2-group]].

* The [[fivebrane 6-group]] is an extension in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of the [[string 2-group]] by the [[circle n-group|circle 6-group]].
