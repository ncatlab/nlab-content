## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] a _[[quantum state]]_ is called _quasi-free_ if 

1. its [[n-point functions]] are non-vanishing only for [[even number|even]] $n$;

1. its [[2-point function]] determines all its $n$-point functions.

This reflects the structure of the [[Wick algebra]] of [[quantum observables]] for the [[free field]].

## Examples

* [[quasi-free Hadamard states]] 

## Related concepts

* [[coherent quantum state]]
