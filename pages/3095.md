## Idea

**Linguistics** is the (scientific) study of natural human language. See a reasonably good page at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics). 


## Formal Linguistics

Linguists may deploy formal methods to understand grammatical strings of words, and to allow compositional theories of meaning based on the meanings of the subparts of sentences.
