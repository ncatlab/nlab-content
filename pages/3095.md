**Linguistics** is a (scientific) study of human language (this limitation is advocated e.g. by [Andr√© Martinet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Martinet)). See a reasonably good page at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics). 

In mathematics and computer science, we are however also interested in artificial analogues of natural languages: formal and computer languages.

Zoran: It seems there was a spam here, but the title is needed at [[category theory]] and is worthy to say few words about for formal purposes.
