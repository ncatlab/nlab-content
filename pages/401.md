## Idea

A _deformation retract_ is a [[retract]] which is also a [[section]] up to [[homotopy]]. Equivalently, it is a [[homotopy equivalence]] one of whose two homotopies is in fact an [[identity]].

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] equipped with a notion of [[homotopy]] between its [[morphisms]]. Then a _deformation retract_ of a morphism

$$
  i : A \to X
$$

is another morphism

$$
  r : X \to A
$$

such that 

$$
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{i}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^=& \searrow^{\mathrlap{r}}
    \\
    A &&\stackrel{=}{\to}&& A
  }
$$

and

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{r}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{\simeq}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    X &&\stackrel{=}{\to}&& X
  }
  \,.
$$

In particular, if "homotopy" in $\mathcal{C}$ means [[left homotopy]] with respect to an [[cylinder object]] $I \otimes X$

$$
  \array{
    X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_0}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{Id_X}}
    \\
    I \otimes X &\stackrel{\sigma_X}{\to}& X
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{d_1}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{Id_X}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,,
$$

then a deformation retract of $i : A \to X$ is a morphism $r : X \to A$ such that $r \circ i = id_A$ and such that there exists a morphism $\eta : I \otimes X \to X$ fitting into a diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{r}{\to}& A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_0}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    I \otimes X &\stackrel{\eta}{\to}& X
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{d_1}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{Id_X}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

If the cylinder object assignment here is functorial, we say that $\eta$ is a **strong deformation retract** if moreover 

$$
  \eta \circ (I \otimes i) = \sigma_X \circ (I \otimes i)
$$

(hence if the homotopy restricted to the inclusion is "constant" as seen by the chosen cylinder object).


In parts of the literature, deformation retracts are required to be strong by default.

## Examples

### In topological spaces

In the category [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] the standard [[cylinder object]] is given by [[cartesian product]] with the [[interval]] $I := [0,1]$.

With respect to the corresponding notion of [[left homotopy]],  if $X$ is a topological space and $A\subset X$ a subspace, then $A$ is a strong deformation retract of $X$ if there exists a [[continuous map]] $H:X\times I\to X$ such that $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in A$, $t\in I=[0,1]$, $H(x,0) = x$ for all $x\in X$ and $H(x,1)\in A$ for all $x\in X$. 

Equivalently, there are continuous maps $i:A\to X$ and $r:X\to A$ such that $r\circ i = id_A$ and $i\circ r\sim id_X (rel A)$, where $\sim (rel A)$ denotes [[homotopy]] with fixed $A$. More generally, for any continuous map $j:Z\to Y$ we say that it is __deformation retractable__ if there is $r:Y\to Z$ such that $j\circ r\sim id_Y$ and $r\circ j = id_Z$.

A pair $(X,A)$ is an __[[NDR-pair]]__ if there are two continuous maps, $u:X\to I,\; H:X\times I\to X$ such that $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in A$ and all $t$, $H(x,0)=x$ for all $x\in X$, $u^{-1}(0)=A$ and $H(x,1)\in A$ for all $x$ such that $u(x)\lt 1$. 
If $(X,A)$ is an NDR-pair, then the inclusion has a left [[homotopy inverse]] iff $A$ is also a [[retract]] of $X$ (in [[Top]], in the standard categorical sense).

The pair $(X,A)$ is a __DR-pair__ if it is a deformation retract and there is a function $u:X\to I$ such that $A=u^{-1}(0)$ (i.e. it gives simultaneously a deformation retract and a NDR-pair). If $(X,A)$ is an NDR-pair then the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow X$ is a homotopy equivalence iff $A$ is a deformation retract of $X$. Any map $f:X\to Y$ is a [[homotopy equivalence]] iff $X$ is the deformation retract of the mapping cylinder of $f$. If $(X,A)$ is an NDR-pair and $A$ is [[contractible space|contractible]], then the quotient map $X\to X/A$ is a homotopy equivalence. 

## Related concepts

* [[retract]], [[neighbourhood retract]]

* [[section]]

* There is also the notion of a [[deformation retract of a homotopical category]], which has a similar feel in some ways but is not closely related.  (It should not be confused with the idea of a deformation retract *in* a [[model category]], which is a direct generalization of the notion described above for [[Top]].)
