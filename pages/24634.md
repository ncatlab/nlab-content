Given a [[quiver]] $Q$ [[quiver with potential|with potential]] which is an element in a (possibly completed) path algebra ${\mathbf C} Q$ of $Q$, one can consider cyclic derivations $\partial_i:HH_0({\mathbf C} Q)\to {\mathbf C} Q$ and the ideal in ${\mathbf C} Q$ generated by all of them. The quotient algebra is called Jacobi algebra or a Jacobian algebra of the quiver. It is a noncommutative analogue of the 
[[Milnor algebra]] of a [[hypersurface singularity]]. 

It is introduced in 

* Zelevinsky

Its role in noncommutative geometry analoguous to describing some properties of hypersurface singularities is partial achieved in

It is called derivation-quotient algebra in
