An **preadditive category** (sometimes just called *additive*) is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[abelian group]]s with their [[tensor product]].  In elementary terms, this means that each [[hom-set]] is an abelian group and composition is bilinear.

In a preadditive category, any [[initial object|initial]] or [[terminal object|terminal]] object is automatically a [[zero object]]; more generally, any finite [[product]] or [[coproduct]] is automatically a [[biproduct]].  (This does not extend to infinite or non-discrete limits.)

An **additive category** is a preadditive category in which all finite biproducts exist; by the previous paragraph, it\'s enough to say either that finite products exist or that finite coproducts exist.  But originally (and often still) this requirement is not included in the term 'additive'.

An especially important sort of additive category is an [[abelian category]].
