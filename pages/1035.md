An **additive category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[abelian group]]s with their [[tensor product]].  In elementary terms, this means that each [[hom-set]] is an abelian group and composition is bilinear.

In an additive category, any [[initial object|initial]] or [[terminal object|terminal]] object is automatically a [[zero object]], and any finite [[product]] or [[coproduct]] is automatically a [[biproduct]].  Sometimes the term "additive category" is taken to include the existence of a zero object and of finite biproducts.

An especially important sort of additive category is an [[abelian category]].
