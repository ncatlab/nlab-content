## Idea



Various [[diagonal arguments]] such as the [[halting theorem]], [[Cantor's theorem]], and [[GÃ¶del]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]] are all instances of the _Lawvere fixed point theorem_, which says that for any [[cartesian closed category]], if there is an [[epimorphism]] from some [[object]] $A$ to the [[exponential object]]/[[internal hom]] from $A$ into some other object $B$

$$
  A \longrightarrow B^A
$$

then every [[endomorphism]] $f \colon B \to B$ of $B$ has a [[fixed point]].
