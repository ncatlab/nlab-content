__Connes' cyclic category__ $\Lambda$ is the full subcategory of $\mathrm{Cat}$ whose objects are the categories $[n]_\Lambda$ which are freely generated by the graph $0\to 1\to 2\to\ldots\to n\to 0$.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Sorry, I don't think I believe this either.  The category freely generated by any of the above graphs (for $n\gt 0$) has infinitely many morphisms between any pair of objects, and therefore (since it is free) infinitely many endomorphisms.  But aren't the hom-sets of $\Lambda$ supposed to be finite?

Cyclic objects in a category $C$ are the contravariant functors $\Lambda^{\mathrm{op}}\to C$, [[cocyclic object]]s are the covariant functors $\Lambda\to C$. This standard terminology is repeating the usual confusion from simplicial categories, because $\Lambda$ itself is, via $\mathrm{id}_\Lambda$, an example of a cocyclic category; hence one should maybe say the [[category of cycles]], what is not customary for $\Lambda$.

We might also call it the [[cycle category]] in analogy with [[simplex category]], [[cube category]], and [[globe category]] that we\'ve already got here.  If that\'s a good system.  ---Toby

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I like that system.
