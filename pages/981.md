__Connes' cyclic category__ $\Lambda$ is the subcategory of $\mathrm{Cat}$ whose objects are the categories $[n]_\Lambda$ which are freely generated by the graph $0\to 1\to 2\to\ldots\to n\to 0$, and whose morphism in $\Lambda([m],[n])$ are those functors in $\mathrm{Cat}([m],[n])$ that have degree $1$ (seen either at the level of nerves or via embedding $C_n\to \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}\cong S^1$
given by $k\mapsto k/(n+1)\,\mathrm{mod}\,\mathbf{Z}$ on the level of objects, the rest being obvious).

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Sorry, I don't think I believe this either.  The category freely generated by any of the above graphs (for $n\gt 0$) has infinitely many morphisms between any pair of objects, and therefore (since it is free) infinitely many endomorphisms.  But aren't the hom-sets of $\Lambda$ supposed to be finite? 

[[Zoran Škoda]] Hom sets of $\Lambda$-yes, but we are now trying to find the concrete realization of objects of $\Lambda$: there are many realizations some involving some sort of categories with infinitely many morphisms. Each $C_n$ in presentation above have infinitely many morphisms in $\mathrm{Cat}$, but only finitely many in $\Lambda$ as I just corrected (thanks for being alert and convince me to think three times!). The infinities in models for $\Lambda$ have to do with a 'reason' why for example finite group model has $SL(2,Z)$ symmetry -- as it is natural to be explained in terms of second iteration of inertia orbifold, which is closely related to cyclic cohomology. But it is confusing because the t-operators are finite...Drinfeld <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0304.5064">talks</a> about $Z_+$ categories when talking about $\Lambda$, maybe I confused something, I'll think about it, in that setup there are infinitely many morphisms for what he calls $[n]_{cyc}$ but maybe it is not the same what I intended to do.

The [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ is a subcategory of $\Lambda$, with the same morphisms but with less objects.
Thus we can identify externally $[n]$ and $[n]_\Lambda$.

Theorem. 
 (i) $\Aut_\Lambda([n]) = \mathbf{Z}/(n+1)\mathbf{Z}$

(ii) $\Lambda([n],[m]) = \Delta([n],[m])\times \mathbf{Z}/(n+1)\mathbf{Z}$ (as a set)

Denote the generator of $\Aut_\Lambda([n])$ by $\tau_n$, then of course $\tau_n^{n+1} = \mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. 

This enables more standard, and equivalent, presentation of $\Lambda$ by generators and relations. In addition to the identities between the coboundaries and codegeneracies $\delta,\sigma$ there are following identities:

[[cyclic object|Cyclic objects]] in a category $C$ are the contravariant functors $\Lambda^{\mathrm{op}}\to C$, [[cocyclic object]]s are the covariant functors $\Lambda\to C$. This standard terminology is repeating the usual confusion from simplicial categories, because $\Lambda$ itself is, via $\mathrm{id}_\Lambda$, an example of a cocyclic category; hence one should maybe say the [[category of cycles]], what is not customary for $\Lambda$.

We might also call it the [[cycle category]] in analogy with [[simplex category]], [[cube category]], and [[globe category]] that we\'ve already got here.  If that\'s a good system.  ---Toby

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I like that system.

[[Zoran Škoda]] I personally prefer category of cycles, even sometimes category of simplices, category of (hyper)cubes as I hear from geometers.  Partly because when you translate to other languages, bahuvrihi style (which is anyway an abbreviation of the other form) is not preferred
(unlike in German where it is even written as one word, and in English in which it is one word but is written as two), or sometimes impossible, hence one needs to convert the modifier back into an adjective when translating, what one does not need with saxon genitive. But I am ambivalent to that issue in other cases, but cycle category sounds too similar to cyclic category (for simplicial there is no problem as it sounds very different from simplex)...
