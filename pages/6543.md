
Recall that the [[Mitchell–Bénabou language]] (MBL) of a [[topos]] is a [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] [[type theory]] in which one can write [[ordinary mathematics]], which can then be [[internalisation|interpreted in]] the topos using the [[Kripke-Joyal semantics|Kripke–Joyal semantics]] (KJS).  However, there is no direct interpretation of unbounded [[quantification]] in these semantics.  The __stack semantics__ extends the KJS to a version of the MBL with unbounded quantifiers.  This has several nice consequences:

*  It makes fully formal many arguments in the literature that claim to use the KJS but implicitly rely on the reader to properly interpret unbounded quantifiers.
*  It makes it easy to interpret the [[internal language]] of more general categories, such as [[pretoposes]], where one cannot quantify over [[subobjects]] using the MBL.
*  Dang, I had another one in my head, but now I forgot it!  Well, doubtless there are many other examples.
