## Idea

A generalization of the concept of [[genus of a surface]] from [[Riemann surfaces]]/[[complex curves]] to [[algebraic varieties]], hence to [[algebraic curves]].

Further base-chaning to [[arithmetic curves]] there is the _[[genus of a number field]]_ (in the sense of the [[function field analogy]]).

## Definition

(...)

essentially the [[Euler characteristic]] $\chi(\mathcal{O}_{\Sigma})$ of the [[structure sheaf]]:

$$
  g_\Sigma = - (\chi(\mathcal{O}_\Sigma) - 1)
$$

(...)
