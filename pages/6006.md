This entry is about the book

* [[Peter May|May]], Sigurdsson, _Parametrized Homotopy Theory_ ([pdf]( http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/EXTHEORY/MaySig.pdf))

which discusses [[homotopy theory]] and [[cohomology]] over base spaces, hence in [[slice categories]] [[Top]]$/X$ for given topological base spaces $X$. 

A survey is in the slides

* [[Peter May]], _What are parameterized spectra good for?_ ([pdf slides](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/TALKS/MichiganPrint.pdf)) 

One application is [[twisted cohomology]]: instead of cocycles given by maps $X \to A$, twisted cocycles are given by [[section]]s $X \to P$ of a bundle $P \to X$ of spectra over $X$.
