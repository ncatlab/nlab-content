## Idea

The concept of a [[special linear group]] $SL(2,K)$ with $K = \mathbb{O}$ the [[octonions]] does not quite make sense, due to the failure of the [[octonions]] to be an [[associative algebra]]. 

Nevertheless, the pattern of the [[special linear groups]] of the other three [[real numbers|real]] [[normed division algebras]] suggests that for some suitably adjusted concept of "special linear group", it should make sense to speak of $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$, after all, and that it should essentially be essentially the [[spin group]] $Spin(9,1)$:

Another proposal for making sense of $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$ is due to [Hitchin 18](#Hitchin18). In this approach, "$SL(2,\mathbb{O})$" is a submanifold of "$GL(2,\mathbb{O})$", which is an open orbit of $Spin(9,1) \times GL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on ${S} \otimes \mathbb{R}^2$.  Here ${S}$ is the 16-dimensional spin representation of $Spin(9,1)$; this may be identified with $\mathbb{O}^2$, which is one reason $Spin(9,1)$ is commonly identified with $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$.
