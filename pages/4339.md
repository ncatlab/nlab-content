A trivial object is too simple to be simple.
=--

Quite often, classical references will define 'simple' (or an analogous term) in naïve way, so that a 'trivial' object *is* simple, but later it will become clear that more sophisticated theorems (especially classification theorems) work better if the definition is changed so that the trivial object is *not* simple.  Usually this can be done by changing 'if' to 'iff' (or sometimes changing 'or' to 'xor') in the classical definition.

Examples include:

*  [[one|1]] is not a [[prime number]].
*  The [[trivial ring]] is not a [[field]].
*  The [[zero object]] is not a [[simple object]] (which is the trope-namer).
*  The [[empty space]] is not a [[connected space]].
*  The [[improper ideal]] is not a [[maximal ideal]] or a [[prime ideal]].
*  The [[improper filter]] is not an [[ultrafilter]].

But of course one may still find definitions used that disagree.

Not that anybody would be naïve enough to believe otherwise, but perhaps the basic example is that

*  [[false|False]] is not [[true]].

The point is that, in many cases, the naïve definition imposes only a uniqueness requirement (so that some set of possibilities ---such as the set of proper divisors of a prime number, or the set of non-invertible elements of a field--- must be a [[subsingleton]]) when it should in fact impose an *existence and uniqueness* requirement (so that the set of possibilities must be a [[singleton]]).  With [[truth values]], uniqueness is automatic, so existence is easier to notice.

The general pattern is a progression of definitions (of 'simple') from more to less naïve:

1.  Suitable for a vague summary but obviously not precisely correct: there are no foos.  (Example: a field has no non-invertible elements.)
2.  Original naïve definition: there are no nontrivial foos.  (Example: a field has no non-invertible elements except $0$.)
3.  Sophisticated definition: there are no nontrivial foos, but there is the trivial foo.  (Example: a field has no non-invertible elements except $0$, but $0$ is non-invertible.)
