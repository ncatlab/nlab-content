## Idea

In a [[monoidal category]], there is a notion of [[modules]] over [[monoid objects]] which generalizes the classical notion of [[modules]] over [[rings]].

## Definition

Let $(\mathcal{V}, \otimes, I)$ be a [[monoidal category]] and $A$ a [[monoid object]] in $\mathcal{V}$, hence an object $A \in \mathcal{V}$ equipped with a multiplication morphism

$$
  \cdot : A \otimes A \to A
$$ 

and a unit element

$$
  e : I \to A
$$

satisfying the [[associativity law]] and the [[unit law]].

###### Definition

A (left) **module** over $A$ in $(\mathcal{V}, \otimes, I)$ is

* an [[object]] $N \in \mathcal{V}$ 

* equipped with a morphism

  $$
    \rho : A \otimes N \to N
  $$

  in $\mathcal{V}$

such that this satisfies the axioms of an [[action]], in that the following are [[commuting diagrams]] in $\mathcal{V}$:

$$
  \array{
     A \otimes A \otimes N &\stackrel{id_A \otimes \rho}{\to}& A \otimes N
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\cdot \otimes id_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
     \\
     A \otimes N &\stackrel{\rho}{\to}& N
  }
$$

and

$$
  \array{   
     I \otimes N &&\stackrel{i \otimes id_N}{\to}&& A \otimes N
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\rho}}
     \\
     && N
  }
  \,.

### Example: modules over monoids in abelian groups

Recall that a [[ring]], in the classical sense, is a [[monoid object]] in the category [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]] with [[monoidal structure]] given by the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $\otimes$. Accordingly a _module over $R$_ is a module in $(Ab,\otimes)$ according to def. \ref{ModuleInMonoidalCategory}.

We unwind what this means in terms of [[abelian groups]] 
regarded as [[sets]] with extra [[structure]]:

###### Definition

A **module** $N$ over a ring $R$ is

1. an [[object]] $N \in $ [[Ab]], hence an [[abelian group]];

1. equipped with a [[morphism]]

   $$
     \alpha : R \otimes N \to N
   $$ 

   in [[Ab]]; hence a [[function]] of the underlying [[sets]] that sends elements

   $$
     (r,n) \mapsto  r n  \coloneqq \alpha(r,n)
   $$

   and which is a [[bilinear function]] in that it satisfies

   $$
    (r, n_1 + n_2) \mapsto r n_1 + r n_2
   $$

   and

   $$
    (r_1 + r_2, n) \mapsto r_1 n + r_2 n
   $$

   for all $r, r_1, r_2 \in R$ and $n,n_1, n_2 \in N$;

1. such that the [[diagram]]

   $$
     \array{
        R \otimes R \otimes N 
        &\stackrel{\cdot_R \otimes Id_N}{\to}& R \otimes N
        \\
        {}^{\mathllap{Id_R \otimes \alpha}}\downarrow 
        && 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\alpha}}
        \\
        R \otimes N &\to& N 
     }
   $$

   [[commuting diagram|commutes]] in [[Ab]],  which means that for all elements as before we have

   $$
     (r_1 \cdot r_2) n = r_1 (r_2 n)
      \,.
   $$

1. such that the diagram

   $$
     \array{
        1 \otimes N &&\stackrel{1 \otimes id_N}{\to}&& R \otimes N
        \\
        & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\alpha}}
        \\
        && N
     }
   $$
     
   commutes, which means that on elements as above 

   $$
     1 \cdot n = n
     \,.
   $$

###### Remark


The category of all modules over all commutative rings is [[Mod]]. It is a [[bifibration]]

$$
  Mod \to CRing
$$

over [[CRing]].

This fibration may be characterized intrinsically, which gives
yet another way of defining $R$-modules. This we turn to 
[below](#ModulesOverARingInTermsOfStabilizedSlices).
