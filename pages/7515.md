The __Gaussian numbers__, sometimes (unnecessarily) called the __Gaussian rational numbers__, are the elements of the [[number field]] $\mathbb{Q} + \mathrm{i}\mathbb{Q}$, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of [[rational numbers]].  In other words, a [[complex number]] is Gaussian (and a fortiori [[algebraic number|algebraic]]) iff both its [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary parts]] are rational.  The __Gaussian integers__ are the [[algebraic integers]] in the Gaussian numbers, which happen to be simply the elements of the [[integral domain]] $\mathbb{Z} + \mathrm{i}\mathbb{Z}$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ is the integral domain of (rational) [[integers]].
