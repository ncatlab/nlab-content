A _rigid_ [[monoidal category]] is essentially a [[monoidal category]] where every [[object]] has a dual. Conventions differ as to the precise way in which this is used. 

One convention is as follows: a _right dual_ of an object $V$ in a monoidal category is an object $V^*$ equipped with unit $\eta : 1 \rightarrow V^* \otimes V$ and counit maps $\epsilon: V \otimes V^* \rightarrow 1$ satisfying the [[triangle identities]] (the snake diagrams). Similarly for left duals.

This convention fits in with the standardized conventions regarding [[adjoint functor]]s. Namely according to this convention, an endofunctor $F : C \rightarrow C$ has a right adjoint $F^* : C \rightarrow C$ if and only if $F^*$ is a right dual of $F$ in the [[monoidal category]] $End(C)$.

###### Definition

A [[monoidal category]] is _rigid_ if every object has both a right dual and a left dual. 
=--

Note that this definition only asserts the existence of the dual objects. It does _not_ assert that specific duals have been chosen. Nor does it assert that the right dual of an object is isomorphic to its left dual: this need not be the case in general, though it is true in a [[braided monoidal category]], and thus automatically also in a [[symmetric monoidal category]].  In practice, algebraic geometers are the most frequent users of the term 'rigid', and they focus on the symmetric monoidal case, so they ignore the difference between right and left duals.
