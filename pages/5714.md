## Idea

A _presymplectic structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] or more generally on a [[smooth space]] $X$  is a closed [[differential form|differential 2-form]] $\omega \in \Omega^2(X)$. 

If the 2-form is moreover _non-degenerate_ then it is a _[[symplectic structure]]_ on $X$. 

Give a presymplectic structure, the [[quotient]] of $X$ by the [[flow]] of the [[vector fields]] in the [[kernel]] of $\omega$ is, if it exists in a reasonable way, a [[symplectic manifold]].

One speaks of closed 2-forms as presymplectic structures if one is interested in eventually forming this quotient and obtaining a symplectic structure. 

The central application of this appears in the theory of [[quantization]] of [[action functionals]]. The [[covariant phase space]] of a [[local action functional]] is canonically presymplectic, and one is interested in its quotientient by symmetries to obtain a symplectic structure. This quotient generically is very ill behaved, though, when taken in the naive way. The [[BV-BRST formalism]] is all about forming this quotient "up to homotopy", such that it exists in a reasonable way. See [[derived critical locus]] for more on this.

The notion of presymplectic structure is a weakening of the notion of [[symplectic structure]] roughly orthogonal to the notion of [[Poisson structure]].
