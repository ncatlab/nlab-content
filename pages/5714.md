## Idea

A _presymplectic structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$  is a closed [[differential form|2-form]] $\omega \in \Omega^2(X)$, thought of as a relaxed version of a [[symplectic structure]] on $X$, for which this 2-form is required to be non-degenerate.

The notion of presymplectic structure is a weakening of the notion of [[symplectic structure]] roughly orthogonal to the notion of [[Poisson structure]].

## Examples

* Every [[covariant phase space]] for a [[local action functional]] canonically carries a presymplectic structure.

## References

The generalization of [[symplectic reduction]] for presymplectic manifolds is discussed in
