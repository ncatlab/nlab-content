## contact {#contact} 

The best way to contact me is by sending me an email at <urs.schreiber@gmail.com>


## my position {#myposition}

I am researcher in the department _[Algebra, Geometry and Mathematical Physics](http://www.math.cas.cz/recherche/equipe.php?id_equipe=18&lang=0)_
of the [Institute of Mathematics](http://www.math.cas.cz/recherche/equipe.php?id_equipe=18&lang=0) at the [Czech Academy of the Sciences](http://www.cas.cz/index.html) (CAS) in [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague).


## my research {#myresearch}

My research is about mathematical theory building in theoretical fundamental physics. With [[Hisham Sati]] we have edited a survey book that should give a good sense of modern insights into the general abstract structure of the world:

* _[[schreiber:Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field and Perturbative String Theory]]_.

I am writing a monograph about this subject:

* _[[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|Differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]_.


## teaching 

In spring 2015 I was teaching a seminar on 

* _[[schreiber:Higher Cartan Geometry]]_

A list of notes prepared for seminars that I taught in the past is here

* _[teaching lecture notes](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage#Teaching)_;


## publications, talks, and students

A personal [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) with more information on my research, talks, students, teaching and other activity is here:

* _[[schreiber:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]]_.

See specifically:

* [publications](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos#Subprojects);

* [talks](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos#References);

  Here is the video recording of a sample research talk that I have given recently:

  _[[differential cohesion and idelic structure|Fractures, Ideles and the Differential Hexagon]]_, talk at [ CUNY workshop on differential cohomologies](http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~swilson/cunyworkshop14.html), New York, August  2014 ([video recording](http://videostreaming.gc.cuny.edu/videos/video/1806/))

## $n$Lab

<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage"><div style="float:right;margin:0 20px 10px 20px;"><img width = "250" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1hvpz.png" alt="nLab banner" /></div></a>

I like to put information into context. For that purpose I had started the 

* [nLab wiki project](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) 

in November 2008. It has now more than 11,000 pages (some very short, but some very long).  In May 2015 the $n$Lab installation migrated from a server paid out of my pocket to a server hosted at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, funded by [[Steve Awodey]]'s [MURI grant](http://homotopytypetheory.org/2014/04/29/hott-awarded-a-muri/) for [[homotopy type theory]] research.

For more on what the $n$Lab is see also

* Wikipedia on: _[nLab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLab)_.

## column

I am writing an irregular column at [PhysicsForums](https://www.physicsforums.com). Recent articles in the series include these:

* _[Homotopy Lie n-algebras in Supergravity](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/homotopy-lie-n-algebras-supergravity/)_

* _[Emergence from the superpoint](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/emergence-from-the-superpoint/)_

* _[Higher prequantum geometry I: The need for prequantum geometry](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/higher-prequantum-geometry-need-prequantum-geometry/)_

* _[Higher prequantum geometry II: The principle of extremal action -- Comonadically](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/higher-prequantum-geometry-ii-principle-extremal-action-comonadically/#toggle-id-1)_

* _[Higher prequantum geometry III: The global action functional -- Cohomologically](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/higher-prequantum-geometry-iii-global-action-functional-cohomologically/)_

* _[Higher prequantum geometry IV: The covariant phase space -- Transgressively](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/higher-prequantum-geometry-iv-covariant-phase-space-transgressively/)_
