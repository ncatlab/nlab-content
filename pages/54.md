## contact {#contact} 

The best way to contact me is by sending me an email at <urs.schreiber@gmail.com>


## my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in theoretical [[physics]]. Have been a postdoc in [[mathematics|maths]] and [[mathematical physics]] for four years at Hamburg University. Was based for a bit at <a href="http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/">MPI in Bonn</a> and have a postdoc position in Prof. [[Ieke Moerdijk]]'s group since 2009, first in Utrecht and then the group moved to Nijmegen in 2012.

## my research {#myresearch}

My research is about mathematical model building in theoretical physics. With [[Hisham Sati]] we have edited a survey book that should give a good sense of modern insights into the general abstract structure of the world:

* _[[schreiber:Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field and Perturbative String Theory]]_.

I have also written a technical book about this question:

* _[[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|Differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]_.

See the exposition at 

* _[[schreiber:Synthetic Quantum Field Theory|Synthetic quantum field theory]]_.

This is the kind of stuff that I am working on.

## students, teaching and other activity

I like to put information into context. For that purpose I had started the [nLab wiki project](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) in November 2008 (see [Wikipedia on "nLab"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLab)).

A personal [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) with more information on my research, students, teaching and other activity is here:
