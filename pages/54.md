# my position # 

I have my PhD in theoretical [[physics]], have been a postdoc in [[mathematics|math]] for four years now (in Hamburg). Currently I am based at the <a href="http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/">MPI in Bonn</a> and am about to start another postdoc position in [[Ieke Moerdijk]]'s [group](http://www.math.uu.nl/Research/Topology/) in Utrecht. 

# my research # 

My research has to a large extent been motivated by thinking about mathematical model building in theoretical [[physics]]. Something like a personal research wiki with more information is beginning to develop at

* [my personal web within the nLab](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage)


# exchange of thoughts #

I enjoy exchanging thoughts on topics of interest for my research and always felt it would be a pity not to use the web for that purpose. To satisfy that need I use to 

* discuss on the blog [The n-Category Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)

* work on the wiki [The nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) (this wiki here).
