## my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in theoretical [[physics]] but have worked in math departments ever since. Have been a postdoc in [[mathematics|maths]] and [[mathematical physics]] for four years at Hamburg University. Had then a few months of guest position at [HIM](http://www.hausdorff-research-institute.uni-bonn.de) and then at [MPI](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/) in Bonn, and since 2009 have a postdoc position in Prof. [[Ieke Moerdijk]]'s group, first in Utrecht and then the group moved to Nijmegen in 2012.

## my research {#myresearch}

My research is about mathematical theory building in theoretical fundamental physics. With [[Hisham Sati]] we have edited a survey book that should give a good sense of modern insights into the general abstract structure of the world:

* _[[schreiber:Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field and Perturbative String Theory]]_.

Concretely the questions that I am thinking about myself are laid out a bit in my

* _[Research Statement (pdf)](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/files/SchreiberStatement.pdf)_

I have written a technical book about this question:

* _[[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|Differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]_.

See maybe the exposition at 

* _[[schreiber:Synthetic Quantum Field Theory|Synthetic quantum field theory]]_.

This is the kind of stuff that I am working on.

## publications, talks, teaching and students

A personal [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) with more information on my research, talks, students, teaching and other activity is here:

* _[[schreiber:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]]_.

See specifically:

* [publications](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos#Subprojects);

* [talks](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos#References);

* [teaching lecture notes](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage#Teaching);

* [students](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage#students).

## $n$Lab

I like to put information into context. For that purpose I had started the 

* [nLab wiki project](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) 

in November 2008. At the moment it has a nominal page count of almost 10,000 entries (some very short, but some very long).
