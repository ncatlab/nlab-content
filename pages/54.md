## my position {#myposition}

Presently I am visiting professsor at the _[Eduard Čech Institute for Algebra, Geometry and Physics](http://eci.karlin.mff.cuni.cz)_ in Prague, in Prof. [Vladimír Souček](http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~soucek/)'s group 

I have my PhD in theoretical [[physics]] but have worked in math departments ever since. Have been a postdoc in [[mathematics|maths]] and [[mathematical physics]] for four years at Hamburg University. Had then a few months of guest researcher position at [HIM](http://www.hausdorff-research-institute.uni-bonn.de) and then at [MPI](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/) in Bonn. From 2009 to 2014 I had a postdoc position in Prof. [[Ieke Moerdijk]]'s group, first in Utrecht and then the group moved to Nijmegen in 2012. The end of 2014 I was a guest researcher at Paris-Diderot visiting [Gabriel Catren's group](http://www.sphere.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?article675) in a program on homotopy type theory and the foundations of physics.


## my research {#myresearch}

My research is about mathematical theory building in theoretical fundamental physics. With [[Hisham Sati]] we have edited a survey book that should give a good sense of modern insights into the general abstract structure of the world:

* _[[schreiber:Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field and Perturbative String Theory]]_.

Concretely the questions that I am thinking about myself are laid out a bit in my

* _[Research Statement (pdf)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12630719/SchreiberStatement.pdf)_

I am writing a technical book about this question:

* _[[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|Differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]_.


This is the kind of stuff that I am working on.

## teaching 

This spring I am teaching a seminar on 

* _[[schreiber:Higher Cartan Geometry]]_

A list of notes prepared with seminars that I taught in the past is at this link:

* _[teaching lecture notes](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage#Teaching)_;


## publications, talks, and students

A personal [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) with more information on my research, talks, students, teaching and other activity is here:

* _[[schreiber:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]]_.

See specifically:

* [publications](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos#Subprojects);

* [talks](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos#References);

  Here is the video recording of a sample research talk that I have given recently:

  _[[differential cohesion and idelic structure|Fractures, Ideles and the Differential Hexagon]]_, talk at [ CUNY workshop on differential cohomologies](http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~swilson/cunyworkshop14.html), New York, August  2014 ([video recording](http://videostreaming.gc.cuny.edu/videos/video/1806/))

I like to put information into context. For that purpose I had started the 

* [nLab wiki project](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) 

in November 2008. It has now more than 10,000 pages (some very short, but some very long).

* Wikipedia on: _[nLab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLab)_.
