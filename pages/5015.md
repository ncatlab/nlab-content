## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #PlainDefinition}
###### Definition

A [[topological groupoid]] or [[Lie groupoid]] $C$ is called an **étale groupoid** if the [[domain|source]]-map $s : Mor C \to Obj C$ is a [[local homeomorphism]] or [[local diffeomorphism]], respectively, and hence exhibits the space of morphisms as an [[étale space]] over the space of objects.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the situation of def. \ref{PlainDefinition} it follows that all the other structure maps ([[codomain|target]], [[identity]], [[composition]]) are also local homeomorphisms, resp. local diffeomorphisms.

This means that an étale groupoid is equivakentlly [[internal groupoid]] in the [[category]] whose objects are [[topological spaces]]/[[smooth manifold]]s and whose [[morphisms]] are local homeomorphisms/diffeomorphisms.

###### Remark

Definition \ref{PlainDefinition} is not invariant under the general notion of [[equivalence]] of Lie groupoids, the equivalence between them regarded as [[smooth groupoids]], specifically as [[differentiable stacks]] ("[[Morita equivalence]]"). 

But it does make sense to take an **étale smooth groupoid** to be a [[smooth groupoid]]/[[differentiable stack]] which is equivalent, as such, to, hence is presented by an étale Lie groupoid as in def. \ref{PlainDefinition}. 
This notion has been called **folitation groupoid** in ([Crainic-Moerdijk 00](#CrainicMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For a [[Lie groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ the following are equivalent

1. $\mathcal{G}$ is a foliation groupoid, hence is equivalent, as a [[differentiable stack]] to an étale groupoid as in def. \ref{PlainDefinition};

1. The [[Lie algebroid]] $(\mathfrak{g},\mathcal{G}_0)$ which corresponds to $\mathcal{G}$ under [[Lie differentiation]] has an [[injection|injective]] [[anchor map]];

   hence the [[orbits]] of $\mathcal{G}$ form the [[leaves]] of a [[foliation]], the foliation whose leaves are tangent to the vectors in the image of this anchor map;

1. All [[isotropy groups]] of $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ are [[discrete groups]].

This is ([Crainic-Moerdijk 00, theorem 1](#CrainicMoerdijk)).

## Properties

### Cohomology and homology

In the literature one finds, roughly speaking, two different approaches to the study of étale groupoids. One approach is based on the construction of the convolution algebras associated to an étale groupoid, in the spirit of Connes' [[noncommutative geometry]], and involves the study of [[cyclic homology|cyclic]] and [[Hochschild homology]] and [[Hochschild cohomology|cohomology]] of these algebras. The other approach uses methods of algebraic topology such as the construction of the [[classifying space]] of an
étale groupoid and its [[abelian sheaf cohomology|(sheaf) cohomology groups]].

## Examples

&Eacute;tale groupoids arise naturally as models for [[leaf spaces]] of [[foliations]], for [[orbifold]]s, and for [[orbit spaces]] of [[discrete group]] [[actions]].


* Every [[topological space]] may be regarded as an étale groupoid with only identity morphisms.

* For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $\Gamma$ a [[discrete group]] with a continuous [[action]] $X \times \Gamma \to X$ on $X$, the [[action groupoid]] $X//\Gamma$ is étale.

* The [[Haefliger groupoid]] $\Gamma^q$ has the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^q$ as its space of objects. A [[morphism]] $x \to y$ is a [[germ]] of a [[diffeomorphism]] $(\mathbb{R}^q,x) \to (\mathbb{R}^q, y)$.

  This groupoid, and its [[geometric realization]] play a central role in [[foliation theory]].

* Every [[orbifold]] is an étale [[Lie groupoid]].
