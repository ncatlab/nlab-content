## Idea

[[K-theory]] of [[stacks]], often of [[geometric stacks]] such as [[differentiable stacks]]/[[Lie groupoids]]. Under mild assumptions equivalently the [[operator K-theory]] of their [[groupoid convolution algebras]].

The [[twisted K-theory]] of geometric stacks $X$ assigns K-classes to maps $X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ to the [[moduli 2-stack]] of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundles]].


## Definition 

We discuss two different but related definitions. The first

* _[By topological K-theory of Hilbert bundles](#ByTopologicalKTheoryOfHilbertBundles)_

realizes the K-theory of a suitable [[Lie groupoid]] (a [[local quotient groupoid]]) as a class in the [[Grothendieck group]] of suitable [[equivariant vector bundles]] ([[Hilbert space]] bundles). The second

* _[By operator K-theory of convolution algebras](#ByOperatorKTheoryOfConvolutionAlgebras)_

realizes it as the [[operator K-theory]] of the [[groupoid convolution algebra]].

In the [Properties-section](#Properties) below we discuss how both definitions are compatible.

### By topological K-theory of Hilbert bundles on groupoids
 {#ByTopologicalKTheoryOfHilbertBundles}

For [[local quotient groupoids]] one can define their K-theory as, essentially, the [[Grothendieck group]] of [[equivariant vector bundles]] on the groupoid, or rather, in the twisted case, by equivalence classes of sections of Fredholm bundles. (...)

([FHT, I, 3.2](#FHT))

### By Operator K-theory of convolution algebras of groupoids
 {#ByOperatorKTheoryOfConvolutionAlgebras}

One can define the (twisted) K-theory of a [[Lie groupoid]] (equipped with a circle 2-bundle) to be the [[operator K-theory]] of its [[groupoid convolution algebra]].

([TuXuLG 03](#TuXuLG03))

## Properties
 {#Properties}

For $X$ a [[proper Lie groupoid]], the two definition above agree. ([TuXuLG 03, 4.6](#TuXuLG03)).
