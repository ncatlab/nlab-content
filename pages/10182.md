## Idea

[[K-theory]] of [[stacks]], often of [[geometric stacks]] such as [[differentiable stacks]]/[[Lie groupoids]]. Under mild assumptions equivalently the [[operator K-theory]] of their [[groupoid convolution algebras]].

The [[twisted K-theory]] of geometric stacks $X$ assigns K-classes to maps $X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ to the [[moduli 2-stack]] of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundles]].
