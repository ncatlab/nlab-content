## The canonical model structure on $Cat$

The **canonical model structure** on [[Cat]] is a [[model structure]] which encapsulates part of [[category theory]] as a version of [[homotopy theory]].  It is a special case of the general notion of [[canonical model structure]] on categorical structures, and is also called the **trivial model structure** or the **categorical model structure**.  Its [[weak equivalences]] are the [[equivalences of categories]] and its [[homotopy category]] is [[Ho(Cat)]], the category obtained from the 1-category $Cat$ by identifying naturally isomorphic functors. See the
_[[joyalscatlab:Model structures on Cat|Catlab]]_ for the theory 
of this structure. 

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the canonical model is the _unique_ model structure on $Cat$ such that the weak equivalences are categorical equivalences (thus justifying the word 'canonical'). 

On this page we give a concise construction of the canonical model structure, as well as two variants that make sense in the absence of the full [[axiom of choice]].

### The classical version

For purposes of this page, [[Cat]] will denote the [[1-category]] of [[small categories]] and [[functors]], and our categories are all [[strict categories]] as in ordinary set-theoretic [[foundations]].  We write $C_0$ for the set of objects of a small category $C$.  Define a functor to be:

* a [[weak equivalence]] if it is an [[equivalence of categories]], or equivalently if it is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] and [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]].

* a [[cofibration]] if it is injective on objects, i.e. an [[isocofibration]].

* a [[fibration]] if it is an [[isofibration]].

We claim that this defines a model structure.  It is easy to verify that the weak equivalences satisfy the [[2-out-of-3 property]]; thus it remains to show that (acyclic cofibrations, fibrations) and (cofibrations, acyclic fibrations) are [[weak factorization systems]].

Suppose given a square
$$\array{A & \overset{f}{\to} & C\\
  ^i\downarrow && \downarrow^p\\
  B& \underset{g}{\to} & D}$$
in which $i$ is a cofibration and $p$ a fibration.

Suppose first that $p$ is acyclic.  It is easy to see that the acyclic fibrations are precisely the equivalences of categories that are surjective on objects.  Thus, since (mono, epi) is a [[weak factorization system on Set]], we can define $h_0\colon B_0\to C_0$ filling the square, and then full-faithfulness of $p$ gives a unique definition of $h$ on arrows.

Now suppose that $i$ is acyclic, so that $i_0 \colon A_0 \to B_0$ is injective.  Since $i$ is essentially surjective, we can choose, for each $b\in B_0 \setminus A_0$, an isomorphism $\phi_b\colon i(a_b) \cong b$.  We then have $g(\phi_b)\colon p(f(a_b)) = g(i(a_b)) \cong g(b)$, so since $p$ is an isofibration, we can also choose, for each $b\in B_0$, an isomorphism $\psi_b\colon f(a_b) \cong c_b$ such that $p(\psi_b) = g(\phi_b)$.  Define $h_0\colon B_0\to C_0$ to be $f_0$ on the image of $i_0$ and to take $b\in B_0 \setminus A_0$ to $c_b$.  We can define $h$ on arrows by composing with the isomorphisms $\psi$ to make it a lifting.

It remains to prove the factorization axioms.  Suppose given a functor $f\colon A\to B$.  First, define $C_0 = A_0 + B_0$, and make $C$ into a category in the unique way such that the map $C\to B$ induced by $f$ and $1_B$ is fully faithful.  Since it is surjective on objects, it is an acyclic fibration, and clearly the induced map $A\to C$ is injective on objects, i.e. a cofibration.

Next, define $D$ to be the category of triples $(a,b,\phi)$ where $\phi\colon f(a)\cong b$ is an isomorphism in $B$.  In other words, it is the [[comma object|strict iso-comma category]] $(f/_\cong 1_b)$.  The projection $D\to B$ is easily shown to be an isofibration, while the functor $A\to D$ defined by $a \mapsto (a, f(a), 1_{f(a)})$ is an injective equivalence.

This completes the proof.  Note that the two factorizations constructed above are in fact functorial.  This model structure is easily seen to be [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]], although the above factorizations are not those constructed from the [[small object argument]] (though they are closely related to the [[algebraic weak factorization system]]s produced from Richard Garner's modified small object argument).


#### Relation with bisimplicial sets

Recall that Rezk's classifying diagram for a (small) category $C$ is the [[bisimplicial set]] $N (C)$ defined by $N (C)_{n, m} = Fun ([n] \times \mathbf{I}[m], C)$, where $[n]$ is the standard $n$-[[simplex]] considered as a category and $\mathbf{I}$ is the [[localization|groupoid completion]] functor (i.e. $D \mapsto D [D^{-1}]$). There is then an [[adjunction]]
$$\tau_1 \dashv N : Cat \to ssSet$$
and it can be shown (see the following subsection) that the canonical model structure on Cat is the model structure obtained by [[transferred model structure|transferring]] the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|projective model structure]] on $ssSet$. 

#### Uniqueness of model structure (assuming choice) 

A remarkable and perhaps surprising result (and surprisingly not better known!) is that there is just one model structure on $Cat$[^fine] whose equivalences are the usual categorical equivalences, _if_ we assume [[AC]]. 

For now, see this [proof](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/the-canonical-model-structure-on-cat/) by [[Chris Schommer-Pries]]. See also this MathOverflow [thread](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/18744/is-model-structure-on-catset-unique), particularly the [answer](http://mathoverflow.net/a/46471/2926) given by [[Steve Lack]] (with a pertinent comment by [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]]). 

[^fine]: Along similar lines, one can [prove](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~oantolin/notes/modelcatsets.html) (again under AC) that there are nine -- count 'em, nine -- Quillen model structures on $Set$. 

### Without choice

In the absence of the axiom of choice, one must distinguish between *strong equivalences of categories*, which come with an inverse up to isomorphism, and *weak equivalences of categories*, which are merely fully faithful and essentially surjective on objects.  Since weak equivalences of categories still "preserve all categorical information," we might hope to find a model structure on $Cat$ whose weak equivalences are the *weak* equivalences of categories.  The notion of [[anafunctor]] also suggests such an approach, since an anafunctor (the "right" replacement for a functor in the absence of choice) is a particular sort of [[generalized morphism]]: a span $A\leftarrow F \to B$ of functors in which $F\to A$ is a surjective equivalence.

If there is to be such a model structure, however, then since generalized morphisms between fibrant-and-cofibrant objects are all represented by ordinary ones, there must exist "cofibrant categories" and "fibrant categories" such that every anafunctor between fibrant-and-cofibrant categories is equivalent to an honest functor, and every category can be replaced by a fibrant and cofibrant one.  It seems unlikely that this would be true without *any* choice-like axioms, but notably weaker axioms than full AC do suffice.


#### The projective model structure

For the existence of the model structure in this case, we assume [[COSHEP]], aka the "presentation axiom," namely that the category [[Set]] has enough [[projective objects]].  Define a functor $f\colon A\to B$ to be:

* a [[weak equivalence]] if it is a weak equivalence of categories, i.e. [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] and [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective on objects]].

* a [[cofibration]] if it is injective on objects, and $B_0\setminus f(A_0)$ is a projective object in $Set$.

* a [[fibration]] if it is an [[isofibration]].

As before, the acyclic fibrations are precisely the weak equivalences that are literally surjective on objects.  Now recall that assuming COSHEP, (monics with projective complement, epics) is a [[weak factorization system on Set]].  This supplies the lifting of cofibrations against acyclic fibrations.  Likewise, the factorization of $f\colon A\to B$ into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration is given by first factoring $f_0$ as $A_0 \to A_0 + B_0' \to B_0$, where $B_0'\to B_0$ is a projective cover.

The other factorization works exactly as before, while for lifting acyclic cofibrations against fibrations, we notice that in the original proof, we only needed to apply choice for sets indexed by $B_0\setminus i(A_0)$, which we have assumed to be projective when $i\colon A\to B$ is a cofibration.

Weak equivalences of categories are easily seen to satisfy the 2-out-of-3 property, so we have a model category.  Note that all categories are fibrant in this model structure, while the cofibrant categories are those whose set of objects is projective.

The existence of this model structure implies, in particular, that under COSHEP the category $Ana(C,D)$ is [[essentially small category|essentially small]], being in fact equivalent to the category $Fun(C',D)$ of ordinary functors where $C'$ is a cofibrant replacement for $C$.


#### The injective model structure

Is there a dual model structure in which all categories are cofibrant?  This seemingly has to do with [[stack]] completion: the fibrant objects would be *stacks* for the [[regular coverage]] of $Set$.  (Without AC, not all small categories are stacks.)  Is Makkai's [[axiom of small cardinality selection]] (which he uses, instead of COSHEP, to prove that $Ana(C,D)$ is essentially small) sufficient for the existence of an "injective" model structure on Cat?
