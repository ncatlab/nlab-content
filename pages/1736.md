Quillen equivalence is the right notion of [[equivalence]] for [[model category|model categories]].  Most importantly, it is weaker than equivalence of categories.  The work of Dwyer--Kan, Bergner and others has shown that Quillen equivalent model categories give rise to equivalent [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].

A [[Quillen functor|Quillen adjunction]] is a Quillen equivalence if for all cofibrant $X$ in $C$, and fibrant $Y$ in $D$, a map $f: FX \to Y$ is a WE in $D$ if and only if $\varphi(f): X \to UY$ is a WE in $C$. This is the same as saying that $L(F,U,\varphi)$ is an adjoint equivalence of categories, which will happen if and only if $LF$ is an equivalence of categories.

For a criterion, see Hovey, page 21.
