## Idea

A [[model category]] is a context in which we can do  [[homotopy theory]] or some generalization thereof; two model categories are 'the same' for this purpose if they are Quillen equivalent.  For example, the classic version of homotopy theory can be done using either [[topological space|topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]].  There is a model category of topological spaces, and a model category of simplicial sets, and they are Quillen equivalent.

In short, Quillen equivalence is the right notion of [[equivalence]] for [[model category|model categories]] --- and most importantly, this notion is weaker than [[equivalence of categories]].  The work of Dwyer--Kan, Bergner and others has shown that Quillen equivalent model categories [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|present]] equivalent [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].


## Definition

Let $C$ and $D$ be [[model category|model categories]] and let

$$
  (L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{R}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{L}{\to}}
   D
$$

be a [[Quillen adjunction]] with $L$ [[left adjoint]] to $R$.

Write $Ho C$ and $Ho D$ for the corresponding [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy categories]].

By the discussion there, $Ho C$ may be regarded as obtained by first passing to the full [[subcategory]] on cofibrant objects and then [[localization|inverting]] [[weak equivalences]], and $L$ (being a left Quillen adjoint) preserves weak equivalences between cofibrant objects.  Thus, $L$ induces a functor 

$$
  \mathbb{L} : Ho C \to Ho D
$$ 

between the [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]], called its (total) left [[derived functor]].  Similarly (but dually), $R$ induces a (total) right derived functor $\mathbb{R} : Ho D \to Ho C$. See at _[homotopy category of a model category -- derived functors](homotopy+category+of+a+model+category#DerivedFunctors)_ for more.

###### Definition

A [[Quillen adjunction]] $(L \dashv R)$ is a **Quillen equivalence** if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied.

* The total left [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{L} : Ho(C) \to Ho(D)$ is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the [[homotopy categories]];

* The total right [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{R} : Ho(D) \to Ho(C)$ is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the [[homotopy categories]];

* For every cofibrant object $c \in C$ and every fibrant object $d \in D$, a morphism $c \to R(d)$ is a weak equivalence in $C$ precisely when the [[adjunct]] morphism $L(c) \to d$ is a weak equivalence in $D$.

* 1. For every cofibrant object $c\in C$, the composite $c \to R(L(c)) \to R(L(c)^{fib})$ (of the [[adjunction unit]] with a fibrant replacement $R(L(c) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} L(c)^{fib})$) is a weak equivalence in $C$, 

  1. For every fibrant object $d\in D$, the composite $L(R(d)^{cof}) \to L(R(d)) \to d$ (of the [[adjunction counit]] with cofibrant replacement $L(R(d)^{cof} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} R(d))$) is a weak equivalence in $D$.

###### Remark

Not every equivalence between homotopy categories of model categories lifts to a Quillen equivalence. An interesting counterexample is given for instance in ([Dugger-Shipley 09](#DuggerShipley09)).

Here are further characterizations:

###### Proposition

If in a [[Quillen adjunction]]  $ \array{\mathcal{C} &\underoverset{\underset{R}{\to}}{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\bot}& \mathcal{D}}$ the [[right adjoint]] $R$ "creates weak equivalences" (in that a morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is a weak equivalence precisly if $U(f)$ is) then $(L \dashv R)$ is a Quillen equivalence precisely already if for all cofibrant objects $d \in \mathcal{D}$ the plain [[adjunction unit]]

$$
  d \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow} R (L (d))
$$

is a weak equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Generally, $(L \dashv R)$ is a Quillen equivalence precisely if

1. for every cofibrant object $d\in \mathcal{D}$, the "derived adjunction unit", hence the composite 

   $$
     d 
       \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
     R(L(d)) 
       \overset{R(j_{L(d)})}{\longrightarrow}
     R(P(L(d)))
   $$ 

   (of the [[adjunction unit]] with image under $R$ of any fibrant replacement $L(d) \underoverset{\in W}{j_{L(d)}}{\longrightarrow} R(P(L(d)))$) is a weak equivalence;

1. for every fibrant object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the "derived adjunction counit", hence the composite 
  
   $$
     L(Q(R(c))) 
       \overset{L(p_{R(c)})}{\longrightarrow} 
     L(R(c)) 
       \overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}
     c
   $$ 

   (of the [[adjunction counit]] with the image under $L$ of any cofibrant replacement $Q R(c)\underoverset{\in W}{p_{R(c)}}{\longrightarrow} R(c)$  is a weak equivalence in $D$.

Consider the first condition: Since $R$ preserves the weak equivalence $j_{L(d)}$, by [[two-out-of-three]] the composite in the first item is a weak equivalence precisely if $\eta$ is.

Hence it is now sufficient to show that in this case the second condition above is automatic.

Since $R$ also reflects weak equivalences, the composite in item two is a weak equivalence precisely if its image 

$$
  R(L(Q(R(c))))
    \overset{R(L(p_{R(c))})}{\longrightarrow} 
  R(L(R(c))) 
    \overset{R(\epsilon)}{\longrightarrow}
  R(c)
$$ 

under $R$ is.

Moreover, assuming, by the above, that $\eta_{Q(R(c))}$ on the cofibrant object $Q(R(c))$ is a weak equivalence, then by [[two-out-of-three]] this composite is a weak equivalence precisely if the further composite with $\eta$ is

$$
  Q(R(c))
    \overset{\eta_{Q(R(c))}}{\longrightarrow}
  R(L(Q(R(c))))
    \overset{R(L(p_{R(c))})}{\longrightarrow} 
  R(L(R(c))) 
    \overset{R(\epsilon)}{\longrightarrow}
  R(c)
  \,.
$$ 

But by the formula for [[adjuncts]], this composite is the $(L\dashv R)$-adjunct of the original composite, which is just $p_{R(c)}$

$$
  \frac{
     L(Q(R(c))) 
       \overset{L(p_{R(c)})}{\longrightarrow} 
     L(R(c)) 
       \overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}
     c
  }{
     Q(R(C)) \overset{p_{R(c)}}{\longrightarrow} R(c)
  }
  \,.
$$

But $p_{R(c)}$ is a weak equivalence by definition of cofibrant replacement.

## Properties

### 2-out-of-3 
  {#TwoOutOfThree}


Since [[equivalence of categories|equivalences of categories]] enjoy the [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3-property]], so do Quillen equivalences.

### Presentation of equivalence of $(\infty,1)$-categories

[[sSet]]-[[enriched functor|enriched]] Quillen equivalences between [[combinatorial model categories]] present equivalences between the corresponding [[locally presentable (infinity,1)-categories]]. And every equivalence between these is presented by a Zig-Zag of Quillen equivalences. See there for more details.
