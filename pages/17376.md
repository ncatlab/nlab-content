## Idea

Given a sequence 

$$
  X_\bullet
  =
  \left(
  X_0 
   \overset{f_0}{\longrightarrow}
  X_1
   \overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}
  X_2
   \overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}
  \cdots
  \right)
$$

of ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]], then its _mapping telescope_ is the result of forming the (reduced) [[mapping cylinder]] $Cyl(f_n)$ for each $n$ and then attaching all these cylinder to each other in the canonical way


At least if all the $f_n$ are inclusions, this is the sequential attachment of ever "larger" cylinders, whence the name "telescope".

The mapping telescope is a representation for the [[homotopy colimit]] over $X_\bullet$. It is used for instance for discussion of [[lim^1 and Milnor sequences]] (and that's maybe the origin of the concept?).

###### Definition

For

$$
  X_\bullet
  =
  \left(
  X_0 
   \overset{f_0}{\longrightarrow}
  X_1
   \overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}
  X_2
   \overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}
  \cdots
  \right)
$$

a sequence ([[cotower]]) in [[Top]], its **mapping telescope** is the [[quotient topological space]] of the [[disjoint union]] of [[product topological spaces]]

$$
  Tel(X_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  \left(
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{sqcup}  
  \left(
    X_n \times [n,n+1]
  \right)
  \right)/_\sim
$$

where the [[equivalence relation]] quotiented out is

$$
  (x_n, n) \sim (f(x_n), n+1)
$$

for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $x_n \in X_n$.

Analogously for $X_\bullet$ a sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] then use [[reduced cylinders]] to set

$$
  Tel(X_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  \left(
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{sqcup}  
  \left(
    X_n \wedge [n,n+1]_+
  \right)
  \right)/_\sim
  \,.
