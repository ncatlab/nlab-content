## Idea

The notion of _Galois topos_ formalizes the collection of [[locally constant sheaves]] that are classified by [[Galois theory]] in the connected and locally connected case.

## Definition

Let 

$$
  (\Delta \dashv \Gamma) : \mathcal{E} \stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} \mathcal{S}
$$

be a [[topos]] sitting by its [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] over aa base $\mathcal{S}$.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ an [[object]] in $\mathcal{E}$, let $Aut_{\mathcal{E}}(X)$ be its [[automorphism group]] (in $\mathcal{S}$). Then $\Delta Aut(X)$ is canonically a [[group object]] in $\mathcal{E}$.

An [[inhabited object|inhabited]] [[object]] $X$ (the [[terminal object|terminal]] morphism $X \to *$ is an [[epimorphism]]) in  $\mathcal{E}$ is called a **Galois object** if it is a $\Delta Aut(X)$-[[torsor]]/[[principal bundle]] in $\mathcal{E}$, in that the canonical morphism

$$
  (Id,\rho) :  X \times \Delta Aut(X) \stackrel{}{\to} X \times X
$$ 

is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Remark

Any Galois object is [[locally constant object]]: since $X \to *$ is epi we may take it as a cover $U = X \to *$ and then then above principality conditon says that pulled back to this cover $X$ becomes constant.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition


A **Galois topos** is a [[topos]] that is

* [[locally connected topos|locally connected]];

* [[connected topos|connected]];

* [[generator|generated]] by its Galois objects.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Often a Galois topos is in addition required to be pointed.

## Examples

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{E}$ [[connected topos|connected]] and 
[[locally connected topos|locally connected]], the full [[subcategory]] generated by [[locally constant object]]s is a Galois topos.
