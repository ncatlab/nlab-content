In [[algebraic geometry]] the most basic and often considered case of [[descent theory]] is the descent of [[quasicoherent sheaves]]. However, [[SGA I]] also considers the descent of affine schemes over a base scheme. 

* [[SGA I]].8.2: Descente des préschémas affines sur un autre 

The basic theorem is that the fibered category $\mathcal{F}$ of [[affine morphism]]s $f: X\to S$ over the site of base schemes $S$ with fpqc topology is a Grothendieck 1-stack (i.e. every fpqc morphism is of effective $\mathcal{F}$-descent). 

This theorem uses more specific reasoning than the theory of descent for quasicoherent sheaves and unlike the former, it does not generalize to the noncommutative case.
