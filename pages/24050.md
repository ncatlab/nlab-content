## Idea

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[condensed infinity-groupoids]]. A **condensed spectrum** is a [[spectrum object]] in [[condensed infinity-groupoids]]. 

Equivalently, since $\mathcal{C}$ is has all [[finite (infinity,1)-limits]], the [[stabilization]] of $\mathcal{C}$ into a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{C})$ exists. A **condensed spectrum** is an object of $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{C})$.
