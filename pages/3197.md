One of the basic results of [[Morse theory]] are so-called Morse inequalities involving Morse numbers. The values in the Morse inequalities depend on a choice of [[Morse function]]. The best possible case if when the Morse inequalities are equalities. In that case we speak of a **perfect Morse function**.

It was for long known that the statement that on every smooth 3-dimensional manifold there is a perfect Morse function is equivalent to the 3-dimensional [Poincaré conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture), which is now the Poincaré-Perelman theorem.
