## Idea

The possible [[actions]] of well-behaved [[topological groups]] (such as [[compact Lie groups]]) on [[topological space|topological]] [[n-spheres]] display various interesting patterns in their classification. 

This entry is meant to eventually list and discuss some of these. For the moment it mainly just collects some references.


## Properties

###### Proposition

Given an continuous [[action]] of the [[circle group]] on the [[topological space|topological]] [[4-sphere]], its [[fixed point]] space is of one of two types:

1. either it is the [[0-sphere]] $S^0 \hookrightarrow S^4$

1. or it has the [[rational homotopy theory|rational homotopy type]] of an even-dimensional sphere.
