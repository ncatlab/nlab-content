## Idea

For suitable setups, there is a canonical [[homomorphism]] from [[algebraic K-theory]] to [[topological K-theory]] with given [[coefficients]].

This usually goes just by "the comparison map". (e.g. [Rosenberg, theorem 2.1](#Rosenberg))

## Statement

### For complex K-theory

There is a natural [[homomorphism]] of [[spectra]]

$$
  K \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow KU
$$

from the [[algebraic K-theory]] of the [[complex numbers]] to [[KU]].

(e.g. [Paluch 01, lemma 2.6](#Paluch01))

### Formulation in cohesive homotopy-type theory

Given a [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]] and a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] $V\in CMon_\infty(Cat_\infty(\mathbf{H}))$, [[internal (∞,1)-category|internal]] to $\mathbf{H}$ write

$$
  \mathcal{K}(V)\in Stab(\mathbf{H})\hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}
$$

for its [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] (formed locally and then [[∞-stackification|∞-stackified]]). This is a [[stable homotopy type]] in the [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

The [[flat modality]] part $\flat \mathcal{K}(V)$ is the [[algebraic K-theory]] of $\flat V \in CMon_\infty(Cat_\infty)$. The [[shape modality]] part on the other hand is a "topological" version of this

The [[points-to-pieces transform]] $\flat \to \Pi$ provides a canonical comparison map

$$
  \flat \mathcal{K}(V) \longrightarrow \Pi \mathcal{K}(V)
  \,.
$$

For instance for $\mathbf{H}= $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] and $V = \mathbf{Vect}^{\oplus}$ the [[stack]] of smooth [[vector bundles]] with [[direct sum]] monoidal structure, then $\flat \mathcal{K}(V)\simeq K \mathbb{C}$ is the [[algebraic K-theory]] of the [[complex numbers]] and $\Pi \mathcal{K}(V)\simeq $ [[KU]] is complex [[topological K-theory]].

See at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_ for more on this.
