## Definition

A [[field]] (as an [[associative algebra|algebraic structure]]) equipped with a [[metric]] is **complete** if the operations are [[continuous function|continuous]] with respect to the induced [[topology]] and it is a [[complete metric space]]. 


The most important case is the case of [[valued fields]].

Given a multiplicative [[discrete valuation]] on a field $k$, there is a [[topology]] on $k$ induced by the metrics induced by the [[valuation]]. A complete valued field is a field complete with respect to the valuation metric. 

## Properties

One of [[Ostrowski's theorems]] says that for $k$ a field [[complete field|complete]] with respect to an [[absolute value]] ${\vert - \vert}$ either the absolute value is archimedean, in which case $k$ is either the field of [[real numbers]] or of [[complex numbers]], or the absolute value is non-archimedean.
