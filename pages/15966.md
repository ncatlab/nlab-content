## A new formulation for classical index theory

Classical real or complex analytic [[index theory]] may be described as a setting that contains both:

* Riemann-Roch type theorems, such as Bismut's Riemann-Roch theorem for a general smooth proper morphism of complex analytic spaces, Grothendieck's Riemann-Roch theorem for a morphism of schemes, or Riou's motivic Riemann-Roch theorem for a projective morphism of schemes, and

* Index theorems for elliptic operators or elliptic complexes on real analytic manifolds (that actually also give Riemann-Roch results, when the elliptic complex is induced by the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on differential forms).

* Equivariant Atiyah-Singer index theorems and noncommutative Connes-Moscovisci local index theorems.

One may formulate many of these results in an essentially unified setting by using index theory on derived analytic stacks over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

## The challenge of global analytic index theory

Global analytic index theory should give a setting for index theory on [[global analytic spaces]] that gives back usual index theorems when one works over $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, but that gives new interesting theorems when one works with analytic spaces or even analytic stacks over $\mathbb{Z}$ equipped with its archimedean norm. It should also give back the p-adic index theorems of Christol-Mebkhout when one works in a Frobenius-equivariant setting over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ or $\mathbb{Q}_p$.

The starting point of this approach should be given by the settlement of a global analytic derived version of Kashiwara and Schapira's microlocal formulation of various index theorems. It is essential, for this approach to work, to have a viewpoint on the microlocalization techniques that is very close to Toen and Vezzosi's loop space approach to the Chern character, through Hochschild and negative cyclic homology of rigid symmetric monoidal stacks of $\infty$-categories over $\infty$-stacks, with an additional microlocal fashion.

## Microlocalization in derived global analytic geometry

Microlocalization in derived geometry involves the proper definition of the deformation to the normal bundle of a closed embedding $Y\subset X$ of global analytic spaces (or even stacks), which is given by the following simple construction.
The space of paths on $X$ based on $Y$ is the groupoid acting on $Y$ given by
$$P_Y X:=\{f\in \Hom(\Delta^1,X),\;f(0)\in Y,\;f(1)\in Y\}.$$
More concretely, this is given by the homotopy pullback
$$
\array{
    P_Y X &\to& \Hom(\Delta^1,X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ev_0\times ev_1}}
    \\
    Y\times Y &\to& X\times X
}
$$
Remark that the natural projection $P_Y X\to Y\times Y$ makes $P_Y X$ a groupoid (of paths in $X$) acting on $Y$. One may pull it back along the diagonal $\Delta:Y\hookrightarrow Y\times Y$ to get the loop space
$$L_Y X:=\{f\in \Hom(\Delta^1,X),\;f(0)=f(1)\in Y\}.$$
There is a natural projection $\tau:L_Y X\to Y$.
A more explicit description of the loop space (that is obtained by using the homotopy $\Delta^1\sim \Delta^0$) is given by the homotopy pullback
$$L_Y X=Y\times^h_X Y,$$
which clearly has an interesting meaning only in the setting of derived geometry.

The deformation to the normal bundle in strict derived global analytic geometry is then simply given by the formula (with $D^1=\mathbb{M}(R\{X\}^\dagger)$ for $R$ the base ind-Banach ring)
$$
\widetilde{L_Y X}:=\{f\in \Hom_{D^1}(\Delta^1\times D^1,X\times D^1),\;f(0,0)=f(1,0)\in Y,\;f(x,t)\in (X\backslash Y)\forall t\neq 0\}.
$$
More concretely (maybe false, but to be corrected), this is given by the homotopy pullback (where $U(1)=\mathbb{M}(R\{X,Y\}^\dagger/(XY-1))$)
$$
\array{
    \widetilde{L_Y X} &\to& \Hom_{D^1}(\Delta^1\times D^1,X\times D^1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ev_{(0,0)}\times ev_{(1,0)}\times \ev_{(-,U(1))}}}
    \\
    Y\times \Hom(\Delta^1\times U(1),(X\backslash Y)) &\stackrel{\Delta\times i}{\to}& X\times X\times \Hom(\Delta^1\times U(1),X)
}
$$
It has an evident natural projection $t:\widetilde{L_Y X}\to D^1$.
