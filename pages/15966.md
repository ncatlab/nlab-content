## A new formulation for classical index theory

Classical real or [[complex analytic geometry|complex analytic]] [[index theory]] may be described as a setting that contains:

* [[Riemann-Roch theorem|Riemann-Roch]] type theorems, such as Bismut's Riemann-Roch theorem for a general smooth proper morphism of complex analytic spaces, Grothendieck's Riemann-Roch theorem for a morphism of schemes, or Riou's motivic Riemann-Roch theorem for a projective morphism of schemes, and

* Index theorems for elliptic operators or elliptic complexes on real analytic manifolds (that actually also give Riemann-Roch results, when the elliptic complex is induced by the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on differential forms).

* Equivariant [[Atiyah-Singer index theorems]] and noncommutative Connes-Moscovisci local index theorems.

One may formulate many of these results in an essentially unified setting by using index theory on derived analytic stacks over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

Recall also that one may solve a linear partial differential equation
$$P(\partial)=0$$
when $P$ has constant coefficients by using the analytic continuation of the complex-valued function $(x,s)\mapsto P(x)^s$. This method is called the Bernstein-Sato method for finding the fundamental solution. There are also other methods, but a natural constraint on the given system is to try to do everything in the analytic setting, and it is thus natural to use complex powers to try to solve it. This will be discussed in more details later. 

## The challenge of global analytic index theory

Global analytic index theory should give a setting for index theory on [[global analytic spaces]] that gives back usual index theorems when one works over $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, but that gives new interesting theorems when one works with analytic spaces or even analytic stacks over $\mathbb{Z}$ equipped with its archimedean norm. It should also give back the p-adic index theorems of Christol-Mebkhout when one works in a Frobenius-equivariant setting over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ or $\mathbb{Q}_p$.

The starting point of this approach should be given by the settlement of a global analytic derived version of Kashiwara and Schapira's microlocal formulation of various index theorems. It is essential, for this approach to work, to have a viewpoint on the microlocalization techniques that is very close to Toen and Vezzosi's loop space approach to the Chern character, through Hochschild and negative cyclic homology of rigid symmetric monoidal stacks of $\infty$-categories over $\infty$-stacks, with an additional microlocal fashion. One also needs a version of [[Grothendieck duality]] adapted to global analytic derived geometry, because it is necessary to define Hochschild homology in Kashiwara and Schapira's approach to index theory.

## A possible set of constraints for a coherent theory

One should be able to define global analytic analogs of:

1. The derived duality functor on coherent $\mathcal{D}$-modules and in particular coherent $\mathcal{O}$-modules (carefully defined as modules on the underlying dagger algebra, locally for the $G$-topology, even in the affinoid case).

1. The Grothendieck six operations on:
* coherent $\mathcal{O}$-modules,
* coherent $\mathcal{O}^t$-modules, where $\mathcal{O}^t$ (definition due to P. Schapira) is the sheaf for the $G$-topology given on a rational domain $R$ with Berkovich interior $\overset{\circ}{R}$ by the subsheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{\overset{\circ}{R}}$ given by functions $f$ with temperate growth, that one may define as the $\mathcal{D}$-module generated by the ---G-topological--- sheaf $\mathcal{O}^b$ of bounded holomorphic functions.
* sub-analytic torsion étale (i.e., Artin-Verdier) or more generally motivic analytic sheaves (using the sheaf-cosheaf formalism of Lurie's book higher algebra, generalized to the $1$-localic topos of étale sheaves on global analytic spaces; one must use the associated etale Berkovich topos to define properly the notion of properness, that is needed for the definition of direct images with proper support; in the strict or generalized Arakelov compactified case, one may need to restrict to morphism of proper logarithmic spaces to get the six operations; this is in some sense analogous to the fact that schemes always have a stacky compactification, i.e., a proper smooth hypercovering, following Deligne), and
* global analytic holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules and global analytic exponential motivic sheaves; the $\mathcal{D}$-module situation should involve also global microlocalization techniques (to get natural conditions for the definition of inverse images) and maybe also the Ran space approach with the $*$-tensor product $\overset{*}{\otimes}$.
* One may also define the Grothendieck six operations on general $\mathcal{D}^\infty$-modules.

1. The Grothendieck six operations on sub-analytic étale Hodge structures (given by a loop space construction of the Hodge filtration, without denominators, together with a Betti structure, given in the real case by non-strict sub-analytic étale constructible sheaves).

1. The Chern character in various situations, using (a probably noncommutative generalization of) the formalism of Toen-Vezzosi applied to the following stacks of rigid (maybe non) symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories on the $\infty$-topos of derived dagger analytic stacks with its pro-etale, Nisnevich or usual analytic topology:
* the stack $X\mapsto Perf(X)$ of perfect $\mathcal{O}$-modules (derived analog of coherent modules),
* the stack $X\mapsto Const_{proet}(X,\mathcal{C})$ of constructible pro-etale sub-analytic sheaves with values in a symmetric monoidal stable presentable $\infty$-category, with their natural tensor product and duality.
* one would also like to treat the case of (at least holonomic) $\mathcal{D}$-modules, either using the Ran space or another construction. It seems that Toen-Vezzosi's approach has to be modified to treat this case properly because of the compound tensor structure $(\otimes^!,\otimes^*)$ on $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the Ran space.

1. The treatment of $\mathcal{D}$-modules and $\mathcal{D}_q$-modules in a uniform setting may involve the following generalization of the Kashiwara and Schapira approach (in a Toen-Vezzosi type of setting) due to F. Petit: one must work with trace kernels, and compute the trace of their action on the Hochschild or cyclic homology of ---non-symmetric--- monoidal categories of (typically) bimodules on an associative algebra. The proper treatment of this theory will be discussed in the section [[non-commutative global analytic index theory]].

## Derived index theory

Using the methods of [[derived microlocalization]] and Kashiwara and Schapira's [[microlocal formulation of index theory]], one may develop a derived index theory.

## Possible references

One may be very tempted to use the following reference, to get a better way of looking at Deligne (or global analytic motivic) cohomology, in use for the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem:
