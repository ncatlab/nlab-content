## Idea

The topology of a countably tight space is determined by countable subsets similar to how in a [[sequential space]] the topology is generated by sequences.

## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called _countably tight_ or _countably generated_ if a set $A \subset X $ is closed if (and hence only if) for each countable subset $D \subset X$ the intersection $A \cap D$ is closed in the relative topology on $D$.

## Categorical properties

The category of countably tight spaces is a [[coreflective subcategory]] of [[Top]]. More precisely, it is the coreflective hull of the subcategory of countable spaces.
