##Idea
An important aspect of [[group theory]] is the study of [[normal subgroups]]. A **protomodular** category, even a non-pointed one, is defined in such a way that it possesses an intrinsic notion of normal subobject. The concept is due to [[Dominique Bourn]] and as such sometimes referred to as _Bourn_-protomodular.

##Definition 

(Taken from [Bourn04](#Bourn04))

Consider any finitely complete category $\mathcal{C}$ and denote by $Pt\mathcal{C}$ the category whose objects are the split epimorphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ with a given splitting and morphisms the commutative squares between these data. Denote by $\pi: Pt\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ the functor associating its codomain with any split epimorphism. Since the category $\mathcal{C}$ has pullbacks, the functor $\pi$ is a fibration which is called the _fibration of pointed objects_.

Any map $f: X \to Y$ induces, by pullbacks, a change of base functor denoted
$f^{\ast}: Pt_Y \mathcal{C} \to Pt_X \mathcal{C}$ between the fibres above $Y$ and $X$.

Then a left exact category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be **protomodular** when the fibration $\pi$ has its change of base functors conservative, i.e. reflecting the isomorphisms. A protomodular category is necessarily [[Mal'cev category|Mal'cev]].

## Examples

*  Certain categories of algebraic varieties, such as the category of groups, the category of rings, the category of associative or Lie algebras over a given ring $A$, the category of Heyting algebras, the varieties of $\Omega$-groups. (It is shown in [Bourn-Janelidze](#BournJan03) that  a variety $V$ of universal algebras is protomodular if and only if it has $0$-ary terms $e_1, \ldots ,e_n$, binary terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$, and $(n+1)$-ary term $t$ satisfying
the identities $t(x, t_1(x, y),\ldots,t_n(x, y)) = y$ and $t_i(x, x) = e_i$ for each $i = 1,\ldots,n$.)

* Categories of algebraic varieties as above internal to a left exact category, for example, [[TopGrp]].

*  Constructions which inherit the property of being protomodular, such as the slice categories $\mathcal{C}/Z$ and the fibres $Pt_Z \mathcal{C}$ of the fibration $\pi$ of pointed objects for instance, or more generally the domain $\mathcal{C}$ of any pullback preserving and conservative functor $U : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$; when its codomain $\mathcal{D}$ is protomodular.

* The dual of a [[topos]].

##Consequences of protomodularity

* a map is a monomorphism if and only if its kernel is trivial
* a reflective relation is an equivalence relation
* an internal category is always an internal groupoid
* a regular epimorphism is always the cokernel of its kernel
* an object is abelian when its diagonal is a normal subobject

A _pointed_ protomodular category is strongly unital, and

* there is a bijection between normal subobjects of an object $X$ and equivalence relations on $X$.

##Strong protomodularity

A category $\mathcal{C}$ is **strongly protomodular**, when it is protomodular and such that any change of base functor $f^{\ast}$ is a _normal_ functor, i.e. a left exact conservative functor which reflects the [[normal monomorphisms]].

[[Grp]], [[Ring]] and the dual of any topos are strongly protomodular.
