## Definition

Let $T$ be an abelian [[Lawvere theory]] (one containing the theory of [[abelian group]]s). Write $\mathbb{A}^1$ for its canonical [[line object]] and $\mathbb{G}_m$ for the corresponding multiplicative group object.

The **projective space** $\mathbb{P}_n$ of $T$ is the [[quotient]]

$$
  \mathbb{P}_n := (\mathbb{A}^{n+1} - \{0\})/\mathbb{G}_m
$$

of the $(n+1)$-fold [[product]] of the line with itself by the canonical [[action]] of $\mathbb{G}_m$.

More generally, for $X$ a pointed space with $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]], the quotient 

$$
 \mathbb{P}(X) :=  (X-\{0\})/\mathbb{G}_m
$$ 

is the corresponding projective space.


### Examples

#### For commutative rings

For $T$ the theory of commutative [[ring]]s, $\mathbb{A}^1$ is the standard [[affine line]]. In this case $\mathbb{P}_n$ is (...)

###### Proposition

For $R$ a commutative ring, there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between

* $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on $R$;

* $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]]s on $Spec R$.

The proof is spelled out at [[graded algebra]].
