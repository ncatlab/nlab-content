## Definition

Let $T$ be an abelian [[Lawvere theory]] (one containing the theory of [[abelian group]]s). Write $\mathbb{A}^1$ for its canonical [[line object]] and $\mathbb{G}_m$ for the corresponding multiplicative group object.

The **projective space** $\mathbb{P}_n$ of $T$ is the [[quotient]]

$$
  \mathbb{P}_n := (\mathbb{A}^{n+1} - \{0\})/\mathbb{G}_m
$$

of the $(n+1)$-fold [[product]] of the line with itself by the canonical [[action]] of $\mathbb{G}_m$. Any point $(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \mathbb{A}^{n+1} - \{0\}$ gives _homogeneous coordinates_ for its image under the quotient map. When considered in this fashion, one often writes $[x_0:x_1:\ldots:x_n]$. Homogeneous  coordinates were introduced in [Möbius 27](#Mobius27)

More generally, for $(X,0)$ a pointed space with (pointed) $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]], the quotient 

$$
 \mathbb{P}(X) :=  (X-\{0\})/\mathbb{G}_m
$$ 

is the corresponding projective space.

If instead of forming the [[quotient]] one forms the weak quotient/[[action groupoid]], one speaks of the [[projective stack]]

$$
  \hat \mathbb{P}(X) := (X-\{0\})//\mathbb{G}_m
  \,.
$$




## Examples

### For commutative rings and algebras

For $T$ the theory of commutative [[ring]]s or more generally commutative [[associative algebra]]s over a ring $k$, $\mathbb{A}_k^1$ is the standard [[affine line]] over $k$. In this case $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ is (...) A closed sub[[scheme]] of $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ is a [[projective scheme]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $R$ a commutative $k$-algebra, there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between

* $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra|gradings]] on $R$;

* $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]]s on $Spec R$.

The proof is spelled out at [[affine line]].

### Real and complex projective space
 {#RealAndComplexProjectiveSpace}

We discuss how complex projective space for $k$ the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]] equipped with their [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] is a [[topological manifold]] and naturally carries the structure of a [[smooth manifold]] (prop. \ref{SmoothManifoldRealComplexProjectiveSpace} below).

* For $\mathbb{R}P^n$ is called _[[real projective space]]_,

* $\mathbb{C}P^n$  is called _[[complex projective space]]_,

  * $\mathbb{C}P^1$ is called the [[Riemann sphere]].

###### Definition
**(topological projective space)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Consider the [[Euclidean space]] $k^{n+1}$ equipped with its [[metric topology]], let $k^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \subset k^{n+1}$ be the [[topological subspace]] which is the [[complement]] of the origin, and consider on its underlying set the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies two points if they differ by [[multiplication]] with some $c \in k$ (necessarily non-zero):

$$
  (\vec x_1 \sim \vec x_2)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{c \in k}{\exists}
    ( \vec x_2 = c \vec x_1 )
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The [[equivalence class]] $[\vec x]$ is traditionally denoted

$$
  [x_1 : x_2 : \cdots : x_{n+1}]
  \,.
$$


Then the _[[projective space]]_ $k P^n$ is the corresponding [[quotient topological space]] 

$$
  k P^n \;\coloneqq\; \left(k^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}\right) / \sim
  \,.
$$

###### Lemma
**(canonical inclusion of projective spaces)**

For $n \in \matzhbb{N}$ the function between topological projective spaces from def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace} given by

$$
  \array{
    k P^n &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& k P^{n+1}
    \\
    [x_1 : \cdots : x_{n+1}] &\mapsto& [ x_1 : \cdots : x_{n+1} : 0]
  }
$$

is a [[continuous function]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

There is a [[commuting square]] of functions of underlying sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1}) &\mapsto& (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1}, 0)
    \\
    k^{n+1} & \overset{}{\longrightarrow} & k^{n+2}
    \\
    \downarrow &\searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    k P^n &\longrightarrow& k P^{n+1}
    \\
    [x_1 : \cdots : x_{n+1}] &\mapsto& [ x_1 : \cdots : x_{n+1} : 0] 
  }
  \,,
$$

where the two vertical functions are the defining quotient co-projections, which are continuous functions by nature of [[quotient spaces]]. The top function is clearly continuous ([[polynomials are continuous]]) and hence so is its composite with the right co-projection, inducated by the diagonal arrow in the above diagram.

This implies that the bottom function is continuous by the nature (the [[universal property]]) of the quotient space topology.

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover}
###### Definition
**(standard open cover of topological projective space)**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the _standard open cover_ of the projective space $k P^n$ (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace}) is 

$$
  \left\{
    U_i \subset k P^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n+1\}}
$$

with 

$$
  U_i 
    \coloneqq 
  \left\{ 
    [x_1 : \cdots : x_{n+1}] \in k P^n
    \;\vert\;
    x_i \neq 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

To see that this is an open cover:

1. This is a cover because with the orgin removed in $k^n \setminus \{0\}$ at every point $[x_1: \cdots : x_{n+1}]$
   at least one of the $x_i$ has to be non-vanishing.

1. These subsets are open in the [[quotient topology]] $k P^n = (k^n \setminus \{0\})/\sim$, since their [[pre-image]] under the quotient co-projection $k^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to k P^n$ coincides with the pre-image $(pr_i\circ\iota)^{-1}( k \setminus \{0\} )$ under the [[projection]] onto the $i$th coordinate in the [[product topological space]] $k^{n+1} = \underset{i \in \{1,\cdots, n\}}{\prod} k$ (where we write $k^n \setminus \{0\} \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} k^n \overset{pr_i}{\to} k$).

+-- {: .num_prop #ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas}
###### Proposition
**(standard open cover is [[atlas]])**

The charts of the standard open cover of def. \ref{TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover} are [[homomorphism|homeomorphic]] to [[Euclidean space]] $k^n$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $x_i \neq 0$ then 

$$
  [x_1 : \cdots : x_i : \cdots : x_{n+1}]
  =
  \left[
    \frac{x_1}{x_i} : \cdots : 1 : \cdots \frac{x_{n+1}}{x_i}
  \right]
$$

and the representatives of the form on the right are _unique_.

This means that 

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n &\overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}& U_i
    \\
    (x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    &\mapsto&
    [x_1: \cdots: 1: \cdots : x_n+1]
  }
$$

is a bijection of sets. 

To see that this is a [[continuous function]], notice that it is the composite

$$
  \array{  
    && \mathrlap{\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{x_i = 0\}}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \phi_i}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^n
     &
      \underset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     &
     U_i
  }
$$

of the function

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n &\overset{\hat \phi_i}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{x_i = 0\}
    \\
    (x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    &\mapsto&
    (x_1, \cdots, 1, \cdots ,x_n+1)
  }
$$

with the quotient projection. Now $\hat \phi_i$ is a [[polynomial]] function and since [[polynomials are continuous]], and since the projection to a [[quotient topological space]] is continuous, and since composites of continuous functions are continuous, it follows that $\phi_i$ is continuous. 

It remains to see that also the [[inverse function]] $\phi_i^{-1}$ is continuous.
Since 

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{x_i = 0\}
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    U_i
      &\overset{\phi_i^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    && \mapsto &&
    ( \frac{x_1}{x_i}, \cdots, \frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \cdots , \frac{x_{n+1}}{x_i})
  }
$$

is a [[rational function]], and since [[rational functions are continuous]], it follows, by nature of the [[quotient topology]], that $\phi_i$ takes open subsets to open subsets, hence that $\phi_i^{-1}$ is continuous.

###### Proposition
**(real/complex projective space is [[smooth manifold]])**

For $k \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}\}$ the topological projective space $k P^n$ (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace}) is a [[topological manifold]].

Equipped with the standard open cover of def. \ref{TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover} regarded as an [[atlas]] by prop. \ref{ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas}, it is a [[differentiable manifold]], in fact a [[smooth manifold]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas} $k P^n$ is a [[locally Euclidean space]]. Moreover, $kP^n$ admits the structure of a [[CW-complex]] ([this prop.](real+projective+space#RealProjectiveSpaceCWComplex)
and [this prop.](complex+projective+space#CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace))
and therefore it is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] since [[CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces]]. This means that it is a [[topological manifold]].

It remains to see that the [[gluing functions]] of this atlas are [[differentiable functions]] and in fact [[smooth functions]]. But by prop. \ref{ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas} they are even [[rational functions]].
