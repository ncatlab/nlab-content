##The epistemic logics $T$ and $T_{(m)}$##
(Similarly to the use on the related pages on $K$, $S4$ and $S5$, the notation $T$ is used to be synonymous with $T_{(1)}$.  It is thus the single agent case and was the orginal case studied. We continue to use the notation from the page on [[epistemic logic]].)

The [[the logic K(m)|basic epistemic logics]], $K$ and $K_{(m)}$, do not reflect much of our intuition of 'knowledge'.  The $K$-axiom merely says that, if an agent knows $\phi$ and also that agent knows $\phi\to \psi$, then the agent knows $\psi$.  There are a series of additional axioms proposed as being appropriate for knowledge, (although, it seems, each has their supporters and detractors!)  These are called $T$, $(4)$, and $B$ (and please don't ask why, ... each has its own history).

##The axioms $T_i$##
This is found in two equivalent forms

* $p\to M_i p$

and 

* $K_i p\to p$.

The first interprets as _if $p$ is true, then agent $i$ considers it possible_ and the second as _atomic statements known by agent $i$ are  true_ .

##The logics $T$ and $T_{(m)}$##
These logics are generated by $K$ (resp. $K_{(m)}$) and the axiom $T$, (resp. axioms $T_i$ for each $i = 1,\ldots m$.

##Semantics##
First looking in the monomodal case, suppose that we have a frame $\mathfrak{F} = (W,R)$ then

{: .un_prop}
######Proposition######
$$\mathfrak{F}\models T if and only if \mathfrak{F} \models  \forall w\in W,   R ww.$$
=--

So the frame that support models for the logic $T$ are the reflexive frames.

######Proof######
Suppose $\mathfrak{F}$ is a reflexive frame and take an arbitrary valuation $V$ on $\mathfrak{F}$ and a state $w$ in $\mathfrak{F}$ so that $(\mathfrak{F},V),w\models p$. We use the first form of $T$ above, and have to prove that $M p$ holds at $w$, i.e., that $p$ holds at some state 'accessible' from $w$, but as $R$ is reflexive, $w$ is accessible from itself, ... .
