##The epistemic logics $T$ and $T_{(m)}$##
(Similarly to on the related pages, the notation $T$ is synonymous with $T_{(1)}$.  It is thus the single agent case and was the first of these logics studied. We continue to use the notation from the page on [[epistemic logic]].)

The [[the logic K(m)|basic epistemic logics]], $K$ and $K_{(m)}$, do not reflect much of our intuition of 'knowledge'.  The $K$-axiom merely says that, if an agent knows $\phi$ and also that agent know $\phi\to \psi$, then the agent knows $\psi$.  There are a series of additional axioms proposed as being appropriate for knowledge, (although, it seems, each has their supporters and detractors!)  These are called $T$, $(4)$, and $B$ (and please don't ask why, ... each has its own history).

##The axioms $T_i$##
This is found in two equivalent forms

* $p\to M_i p$

and 

* $K_i p\to p$.

The first interprets as _if $p$ is true, then agent $i$ considers it possible_ and the second as_atomic statements known by agent $i$ are  true_ .
