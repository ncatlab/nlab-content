Zinbiel is a mathematical person (in the sense like [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] whose mirror person is Leibniz.

A __Zinbiel algebra__ or __dual Leibniz algebra__ (in $Vec$) is a [[nonassociative algebra]] with a product satisfying 

$$
(x y) z = x (z y + y z),
$$
Equivalently, it is an algebra over the operad which is Koszul dual to the [[quadratic operad]] of [[Leibniz algebra]]s.

It is also natural to consider dg-algebras over a dg-version of the operad of dual Leibniz algebras. 

Dually, a __Zinbiel coalgebra__ is a vector space $C$ equipped with a linear map $\delta:C\to C\otimes C$ 
satisfying: $\delta\otimes id)\circ\delta = (id\otimes \delta)
\circ \delta + (id\otimes \tau\delta)\circ\delta$ where $\tau$ is the flip of tensor factors.

> We describe a method for associating to a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over a ring $K$ a sequence of groups $(G_{n}(\mathfrak{g}))_{n\in\N}$, which are {\it polynomial groups} in the sense that will be explained in Definition 5.1. Using a description of these groups by generators and relations, we prove the existence of an action of the symmetric group $\Sigma_{n}$ by automorphisms. The subgroup of fixed points under this action, denoted by $J_{n}(\mathfrak{g})$, is still a polynomial group and we can form the projective limit $J_{\infty}(\mathfrak{g})$ of the sequence $(J_{n}(\mathfrak{g}))_{n\in\N}$. The formal group $J_{\infty}(\g)$ associated in this way to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ may be seen as a generalisation of the formal group associated to a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero by the Campbell-Haussdorf formula.
