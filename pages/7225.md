For a [[prime number]] $p$, the Pr&uuml;fer $p$-group is defined uniquely up to [[isomorphism]] as the group where every element has exactly $p$ $p^{th}$ roots. It is a [[divisible group|divisible]] [[abelian group]] which can be described in several ways, for example: 

* It is the discrete group that is [[Pontrjagin duality|Pontryagin dual]] to the compact group of [[p-adic integer|p-adic integers]]. 

* It is $\mathbb{Z}[1/p]/\mathbb{Z}$, the [[colimit]] of the sequence of inclusions 
$$0 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(p) \hookrightarrow \ldots \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(p^n) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/(p^{n+1}) \hookrightarrow \ldots$$ 


The Pr&uuml;fer $p$-groups are the only infinite groups whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion. They are often useful as [[counterexamples in algebra]]; for example, a Pr&uuml;fer group is an Artinian but not a Noetherian $\mathbb{Z}$-module.
