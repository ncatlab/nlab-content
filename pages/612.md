  **alert**: the new version is now [here](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/DAG-III.pdf)

  the new version differs from the previous one by embedding the theory of [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]] into a theory of [[(∞,1)-operad]]s.

>**Warning** These documents keep being updated and expanded. On the personal webpage as well as, with the due time delay, on the arXiv. Likely many references to page and definition/theorem numbers on the $n$Lab to these articles are already outdated

  on [[derived algebraic geometry]]

  all the material in there should now be, in more complete and more cohenrent form, in the articles above. But some papers will cite page and verse in the PhD thesis, so it is useful to have that as a reference, too.
