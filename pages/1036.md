Within the nLab, "nice category of spaces" is a general but inexact term referring to nice or convenient properties one would like a category of spaces to have for some purpose ("space" here connoting something along topological lines), but typically not satisfied by the category of [[topological spaces]] and [[continuous maps]] itself, thus necessitating a move to some nicer category to suit one's purposes. 

The category [[Top]] of [[topological space|topological spaces]] lacks many good categorical properties.  It is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], and is [[extensive category|extensive]], but:

* not [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] or [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]],
* not [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]], and
* not a [[topos]] or even a [[quasitopos]],
* nor is it even a [[pretopos]] or an [[exact category|exact]] or even a [[regular category]]. 

The lack of cartesian closure and, to a lesser extent, local presentability, is especially problematic for [[homotopy theory]].  Many different solutions for repairing lack of cartesian closure have been proposed, generally involving either restricting to a subcategory of [[Top]] (usually [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] or coreflective, so that it inherits completeness and cocompleteness), enlarging it to a supercategory, or some combination thereof.  Most involve restricting the topologies to those that can be specified on "small" (and in particular, [[compact space|compact]]) subsets.

In particular, a [[convenient category of topological spaces]] is, in the technical sense of the [nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage), a cartesian-closed category of spaces together with some other useful properties (q.v.). 


#Examples#

* The frequent choice among algebraic topologists today is to use the subcategory of [[compactly generated space|compactly generated spaces]], which is cartesian closed, but not locally cartesian closed.  It is a coreflective subcategory of a reflective subcategory of $Top$.

* Homotopy theorists often find the category of [[simplicial sets]] to be an especially nice environment. It is for example a [[Grothendieck topos]], thus a [[locally cartesian closed category]] and satisfying all [[exactness properties]] one expects of toposes, and is a [[locally presentable category]]. The fact that every topological space has a simplicial set as its [[singularization]] then becomes an application of the homotopy theory of simplicial sets to the study of topological spaces, rather than a way to use simplicial sets to study the homotopy theory of topological spaces. 

  For more on this see _[[Top]]_, _[[homotopy theory]]_ and [[infinity-groupoid]].

* The subcategory of [[Delta-generated space]]s, recently proposed by J. H. Smith, is also both cartesian closed and locally presentable.

* An approach of mainly historical interest is to use [[quasitopological space|quasitopological spaces]], an enlargement of $Top$ which is cartesian closed.

* The category $PsTop$ of [[pseudotopological space|pseudotopological spaces]] (also called Choquet spaces) is a quasitopos containing $Top$ as a full reflective subcategory.  In particular, $PsTop$ is [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]] (but not locally presentable).

* In his paper _On a topological topos_, Peter Johnstone described a [[Grothendieck topos]] $E$ which contains the category of [[sequential space|sequential]] topological spaces as a full reflective subcategory which is closed under many colimits (including all those used to define [[CW complex|CW complexes]]).  Again, since $E$ is a Grothendieck topos, it is locally presentable and locally cartesian closed.  Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] and [[singular complex]] functors form a [[geometric morphism]] between $E$ and the category of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].  The "underlying set" functor $E\to Set$ is not [[faithful functor|faithful]], but it is faithful on the full subcategory of [[subsequential space|subsequential spaces]], which contain the sequential spaces and form a [[quasitopos]].  See [[topological topos]].

* On the other hand, the category of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] is perfectly nice for some purposes. While neither cartesian closed nor locally presentable, it is on the other hand a [[pretopos]]. In this way it is both a category of [[nice topological spaces]] and a nice category of topological spaces, thus an exception proving the "rule" described at [[dichotomy between nice objects and nice categories]]. 

* The category of [[locales]] and the full subcategory of [[sober spaces]] can be considered nice for certain purposes. The category of locales is extensive and is opposite to the category of [[frames]] (which is monadic over $Set$ and thus [[exact category|exact]]). The category of locales is however neither cartesian closed nor locally presentable, although there is a nice description of [[exponential object|exponentiable locales]].
