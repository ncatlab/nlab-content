## Introduction and motivation

Urban legend has it that there was a time when only three people understood [[Einstein]]'s [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[classical field theory|classical]] [[gravity]] -- "[[general relativity]]". 

Whether true or not, one of the three was [[David Hilbert]]. He made sure every beginning student today can understand [[general relativity]] by giving it a clear and precise (= rigorous) formalization in [[mathematics]]:

classical Einstein gravity is simply the study of the [[critical points]] of the [[integral]] of the [[scalar curvature]] [[density]] [[action functional|functional]] on the [[moduli space]] of [[pseudo-Riemannian metrics]] on [[spacetime]].

In fact by realizing this mathematical formalization of what Einstein did, he was able to essentially scoop him, that's why this functional is now called the _[[Einstein-Hilbert action functional]]_.

To promote this success, in his famous list of [[Hilbert's problems]] in mathematic, [[Hilbert's 6th problem]] asks [[mathematics|mathematicians]] generally to find [[axioms]] for [[theory (physics)|theories]] in [[physics]]. 

Since then a list of such axiomatizations has been found, for instance

| [[physics]] | [[mathematics]] |
|--|--|
| [[mechanics]] | [[symplectic geometry]] |
| [[gravity]] | [[Riemannian geometry]] |
| [[gauge theory]] | [[Chern-Weil theory]] |
| [[local quantum field theory]] | [[monoidal (âˆž,n)-category]] theory |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |

Two aspects of this list are noteworthy: one the one hand, it contains crown jewels of mathematics, on the other the items appear unrelated and piecemeal.

As a student, [[William Lawvere]] was exposed to the proposal to axiomatize [[thermodynamics]] as what was called "[[rational thermodynamics]]". He realized that a fundamental [[foundation]] of such [[continuum physics]] first of all requires a good foundation of [[differential geometry]] itself. 
Looking over his life publication record (see [[William Lawvere|here]]) one sees that he pursued the following grand plan

**Plan**

1. lay the [[foundations]] of [[mathematics]] in [[topos theory]] ("[[ETCS]]")

1. lay the foundations of [[geometry]] in [[topos theory]] ([[synthetic differential geometry]], [[cohesion]])

1. lay the foundations of [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[continuum physics]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]] ([[toposes of laws of motion]]).

Lawvere became famous for his groundbreaking contributions to the first two items ([[categorical logic]], [[topos theory|elementary topos theory]], [[algebraic theories]], [[synthetic differential geometry|SDG]]). For some reason the motivation of all this by the third item is not as widely recognized, even thought Lawvere continuously emphasized this third point, see the [list of quotations here](William%20Lawvere#MotivationFromFoundationsOfPhysics)).

Here we are interested in understanding the totality of all three items.

Grandiose as this plan is, we have to note that in the above form it falls short in each item:

1. modern [[mathematics]] is naturally founded not in [[topos theory]]/[[type theory]], but in [[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher topos theory]]/[[homotopy type theory]].

1. modern [[geometry]] not just about "variable sets" ([[sheaves]]) but is is [[higher geometry]] about "variable [[homotopy types]]",  [[geometric homotopy types]] ([[stacks]]);

1. modern [[physics]] goes beyond [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[continuum physics]]; at high [[energy]] (small distance) classical physics is refined by [[quantum physics]].


Therefore what is needed is a foundation of [[high energy physics]] in [[higher differential geometry]] formulated in [[higher topos theory]].

Work in this direction is in ([dcct](#dcct)), a concise survey is in _[[schreiber:Synthetic Quantum Field Theory]]_. 

In the following we illustrate three aspects fo the theory. We close by indicating how this theory serves to solve subtle open problems in modern [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]].


## **I)** Mapping spaces in gauge theory and General covariance 
 {#HigherMappingSpaces}

One basic point Lawvere emphasized early on is that central to the formulation of [[physics]] is the existence of _[[mapping spaces]]_ which satisfy the [[exponential law]]. 

(notice: [[mapping space]] ... space of [[trajectories]] ... [[path integral]])

Indeed, generically a [[physical system]] is determined by 

* a [[space]] $\Sigma$ called _[[spacetime]]_ or _[[worldvolume]]_

* a [[space]] $X$ called _[[target space]]_ or _[[field bundle]]_ or _[[moduli space]] of [[field (physics)|fields]]_.

such that a [[trajectory]] or [[physical field|field configurations]] is a map

$$
  \Sigma \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

For instance $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ the abstract [[worldline]] and $X$ [[spacetime]], then $\Sigma \to X$ is the [[trajectory]] of a [[particle]] in [[spacetime]].

Hence the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ is the space of all trajectories, [[path space]] the domain of the infamous [[path integral]].

Lawvere observed that this not only needs to exist as a decent "space", it also needs to satisfy the axiom of an [[internal hom]]. Because if we split

$$
  \Sigma = \mathbb{R} \times \Sigma_{d-1}
$$

into [[time]] and [[space]], then we want that spacetime field configurations

$$
  \mathbb{R} \times \Sigma_{d-1} \longrightarrow X
$$

are equivalently trajectories of fields on space

$$
  \mathbb{R}  \longrightarrow [\Sigma_{d-1}, X]
  \,.
$$

This led Lawvere to recognize that physics ([[prequantum field theory|prequantum physics]], to be precise) is to be formulated in a [[cartesian closed category]], such as a [[topos]].

But actually in modern physics one needs a bit more than this. Physics is fundamentally governed by [[gauge equivalence]], which means that there is no sense in askking if field consigurations are equal, we must ask if they are [[equivalence|equivalent]].

A fundamental example of this is Einstein [[general covariance]].

This says that if 

$$
  s \;\colon\; U \hookrightarrow \Sigma
$$

is a region in spacetime, and $\phi \colon \Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma$ is a [[diffeomorphism]], then

$$
  \phi^\ast s \;\colon\; U \hookrightarrow \Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma
$$

is "the same" region. Stated this way in ordinary [[topos theory]] this is confusing, and historically it was confusing: is was called the "[[hole paradox]]".

But this is resolved in [[higher topos theory]]. Here a [[space]] $S$ is a [[groupoid]] or [[homotopy type]]. This means that it is not sensible to ask if two maps into it are equal, but between any two maps there is a space of equivalences between them.

For general covariance this means by the above that spacetime is not actually a manifold $\Sigma$, but is actually the [[action groupoid]]/[[quotient stack]]

$$
  \Sigma//Diff(\Sigma)
$$

of $\Sigma$ by its [[diffeomorphism group]] (regarded as a [[diffeological group]]).

This is the formalization of "[[general covariance]]". 


But now this means we also need to consider the [[mapping spaces]] in higher topos theory. A basic fact is

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    \Sigma &\longrightarrow& \Sigma//Diff(\Sigma)
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}Diff(\Sigma)
  }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \in
  \;\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}Diff(\Sigma)}
  \simeq Diff(\Sigma)Act(\mathbf{H})
  \,.
$$

Lawvere also introduced [[categorical logic]] and understood [[dependent product]] $\prod$ and [[dependent sum]] $\sum$ as [[base change]]. In [[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher topos theory]] this becomes [[representation theory]] as follows:

[[!include homotopy type representation theory -- table]]

Using this we have the mapping space of fields


$$
  \mathbf{B}Diff(\Sigma)
  \;\;
   \vdash
  \;\;
   \left[
     \Sigma//Diff(\Sigma)
     \,,\;
      X
   \right]
$$

and 

Theorem: down in the absolute context 

$$
   \vdash
  \;\;
   \underset{\mathbf{B}Diff(\Sigma)}{\sum}
   \left[
     \Sigma//Diff(\Sigma)
     \,,\;
      X
   \right]
   \;\;
   \simeq
   \;\;
   [\Sigma, X]//Diff(\Sigma)
  \,.
$$

This is the formalization of the famous insight of Einstein. Derived by lifting Lawvere's argument about mapping spaces from topos theory to higher topos theory.

So as a slogan we conclude that in the formalization of [[physics]] in [[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher topos theory]] we have:

* _[[general covariance]] is homotopy [[coinvariants]]_


## **II)** Toposes of laws of motion and Hamilton-Jacobi-Lagrange mechanics


In ([Lawvere 97](#Lawvere97)) it was observed that [[equations of motion]] in [[physics]] can (almost, see below) be formalized in [[synthetic differential geometry]] as follows.

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an ambient [[smooth topos|synthetic differential]] [[topos]] (such as the [[Cahiers topos]] of [[smooth spaces]] and [[formal smooth manifolds]]).

The canonical [[line object]] $\mathbb{A}^1 = \mathbb{R}$ of this models the [[continuum]] line, the abstract [[worldline]]. Let

$$
  D \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

be the inclusion of the first order [[infinitesimally thickened point|infinitesimal]] neighbourhood of the origin of $\mathbb{R}$ -- in the [[internal logic]] this is $D = \{x \in \mathbb{R}| x^2 = 0\}$, externally it is the [[spectrum of a commutative ring|spectrum]] of the [[ring of dual numbers]] over $\mathbb{R}$.

Then for $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any [[object]] which we are going to think of as a [[configuration space]] of a [[physical system]]. For instance if the system is a [[particle]] propagating on a [[spacetime]], then $X$ is that spacetime. Or $X$ may be the [[phase space]] of the system.

Accordingly the [[mapping space]] $[\mathbb{R}, X] \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[smooth space|smooth]] [[path space]] of $X$. This is the space of potential [[trajectories]] of the [[physical system]].

If $X$ is thought of as [[phase space]], then every point in there determines a unique [[trajectory]] starting at that point. This means that time evolution is then an [[action]] of $\mathbb{R}$ on $X$. As $X$ here might be any space, we have the collection 

$$
  \mathbb{R}Act(\mathbf{H}) \in Topos
$$ 

of all $\mathbb{R}$-[[actions]] on objects in $\mathbf{H}$. This is again a [[topos]], and hence this is a first version of what one might call a _[[topos of laws of motion]]_.

On the other hand, if we think of $X$ as [[configuration space]], then it is (in the simplest but common case of [[physical systems]]) a [[tangent vector]] in $X$ that determines a [[trajectory]], hence a point in $[D,X]$. There is the canonical projection $[\mathbb{R},X] \longrightarrow [D,X]$ from the smooth [[path space]] to the [[tangent bundle]], which sends each path to its [[tangent vector]]/[[derivative]] at $0 \in \mathbb{R}$. A [[section]] of this map is hence an assignment that sends each tangent vector to a [[trajectory]] which starts out with this tangent. Specifying such a section is hence part of what it means to have [[equations of motion]] in [[physics]]. Accordingly in _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_ [[Lawvere]] called the collection of such data a Galilian [[topos of laws of motion]].

Of course this is not quite yet what is actually used and needed in physics.  On p. 9 of ([Lawvere 97](#Lawvere97)) this problem is briefly mentioned:

> But what about actual dynamical systems in the spirit of [[Galileo]], for example, second-order ODEâ€™s? (Of course, the [[symplectic geometry|symplectic]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian systems]] that are also much studied do address this question of states of [[becoming|Becoming]] versus locations of [[being|Being]], but in a special way which it may not be possible to construe as a topos;

It turns out that it does exist as a "[[higher topos theory|higher topos]]".

In _[[schreiber:Classical field theory via Cohesive homotopy types]]_ it is observed that if $\mathbf{H}$ to be not just a [[topos]] but an [[(infinity,1)-topos|infnity-topos]], then genuine [[classical mechanics]] governed by [[Hamilton's equations]] and [[Hamilton-Jacobi theory]] arises by actions of $\mathbb{R}$ on objects in the [[slice (infinity,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}}$, where $\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[moduli stack]] of [[circle group]]-[[principal connections]]. So

$$
  \mathbb{R}Act\left(
    \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}}
  \right)
$$

is actually a "topos of laws of motion" in the sense of Hamilton-Lagrange-Jacobi [[classical mechanics]]. For more on this see _[[Higher toposes of laws of motion]]_.






## **III)** Extensive/intensive duality and Cohomological quantization


...

[[intensive and extensive]] becomes [[motivic quantization]]

...


## An application -- What is it all good for?


Fine-structure of quantum anomaly cancellation in 2d QFT

The first thing to notice is that quantum field theory is
a subject richer than often realized. 

perturbation theory to nonperturbative

higher gauge fields in string theory

([DFM 09](#DFM09)): background RR+B field cocycle in twisted differential K-theory

was not available

[BunkeNikolausVÃ¶lkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13): realizable in [[tangent cohesion]].

Central for the discussion of 2d QFT. 

The infamous "[[landscape of string theory vacua]]" is essentially
the [[moduli space]] of certain 2d field theories satisfying consistency  conditions like this.
