## Definition

_Ab_ is the [[category]] of [[abelian group|abelian groups]]: it has abelian groups as [[object|objects]] and [[group homomorphisms]] between these as [[morphism|morphisms]].

## Properties

### Monoidal structure

$Ab$ can be made into a [[monoidal category]] in several ways, the most notable involving [[direct sum]] $\oplus$ and [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $\otimes$.  

A [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] $(Ab, \otimes)$ is a [[ring]], while a monoid in $(Ab, \oplus)$ is just an abelian group (since $\oplus$ is the [[coproduct]] in $Ab$, so every object has a unique monoid structure with respect to it).

### Enrichment over $Ab$

Categories enriched over $Ab$ are called [[additive category|pre-additive categories]] or sometimes just additive categories.  If they satisfy an extra exactness condition they are called [[abelian category|abelian categories]]. See at _[[additive and abelian categories]]_.
