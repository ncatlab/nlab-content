## Idea

_$Ab$_ denotes the [[category]] of [[abelian group|abelian groups]]: it has abelian groups as [[object|objects]] and [[group homomorphisms]] between these as [[morphism|morphisms]].

The archetypical example of an abelian group is the group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers, and for many purposes it is useful to think of $Ab$ equivalently as the [[category of modules]] over $\mathbb{Z}$

$$
  Ab \simeq \mathbb{Z} Mod
 \,.
$$

The category $Ab$ serves as the basic [[enriched category theory|enriching]] category in [[homological algebra]]. There [[Ab-enriched categories]] play much the same role as [[Set]]-enriched categories ([[locally small categories]]) play in general. 

In this vein, the analog of $Ab$  in [[homotopy theory]] -- or rather in _[[stable homotopy theory]] -- is the category of [[spectra]], either regarded as the [[stable homotopy category]] or rather refined to the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]]. A spectrum is much like an abelian group up to [[coherence law|coherent]] [[homotopy]] and the role of the archetypical abelian group $\mathbb{Z}$ is the played by the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$


## Properties

### Free abelian groups

+-- {: .num_remark #FreeForgetful}
###### Remark

The category $Ab$ is a [[concrete category]], the [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  U : Ab \to Set
$$

to [[Set]] sends a group, regarded as a [[set]] $A$ equipped with the [[structure]] $(+,0)$ of a chose element $0 \in A$ and a binary, associative and 0-unital operation $+$ to its underlying set

$$
  (A, +, 0) \mapsto A
  \,.
$$

This functor has a [[left adjoint]] $F : Set \to Ab$ which sends a set $S$ to the [[free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[S]$ on this set: the group of [[formal linear combinations]] of elements in $S$ with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}$.

### Direct sum, direct product and tensor product
 {#DirectSumEtc}

We discuss basic properties of binary operations on the category of abelian groups: [[direct product]], [[direct sum]] and [[tensor product]]. Below in _[Monoidal and bimonoidal structure](#MonoidalAndBipermutativeStructure)_ we put these structures into a more abstract context.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $A, B \in Ab$ two [[abelian groups]], their
[[direct product]] $A \times B$ is the abelian group whose elements are pairs $(a, b)$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, whose 0-element is $(0,0)$ and whose addition operation is the componentwise addition

$$
  (a_1, b_1) + (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 + a_2, b_1 + b_2)
  \,.
$$

This is at the same time [[generalized the|the]] [[direct sum]] $A \oplus B$.

Similarly for $I \in $[[FinSet]]$\hookrightarrow$ [[Set]] a [[finite set]], we have

$$
  \oplus_{i \in I} A_i \simeq \prod_i A_{i}
  \,.
$$

But for $I \in Set$ a set which is not finite, there is a difference: the [[direct sum]] $\oplus_{i \in I} A_i$ of an $I$-indexed family ${A_i}_{i \in I}$ of abelian groups is the sub-group of the direct product on those elements for which only finitely many components are non-0

$$
  \oplus_{i \in I} A_i \hookrightarrow \prod_i A_i
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

The [[trivial group]] $0 \in Ab$ (the group with a single element) is a [[unit]] for the direct sum: for every abelian group we have

$$
  A \oplus 0 \simeq 0 \oplus A \simeq A
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

In view of remark \ref{FreeForgetful} this means that the direct sum of ${\vert I \vert}$ copies of the additive group of [[integers]] with themselves is equivalently the [[free abelian group]] on $I$:

$$
  \oplus_{i \in I} \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}[I]
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $A$ and $B$ two [[abelian groups]], their [[tensor product of abelian groups]] is the group $A \otimes B$ with the property that a group homomorphism $A \otimes B \to C$ is equivalently a [[bilinear map]] out of the _set_ $A \times B$.

=--

See at _[[tensor product of abelian groups]]_ for details.

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

The [[unit]] for the tensor product of abelian groups is the additive group of [[integers]]: 

$$
  A \otimes \mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z} \otimes A \simeq A
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[tensor product of abelian groups]] [[distributivity law|distributes]] over arbitrary [[direct sums]]: 

$$
  A \otimes (\oplus_{i \in I} B_i) \simeq \oplus_{i \in I} A \otimes B_i
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

For $I \in Set$ and $A \in Ab$, the [[direct sum]] of ${\vert I\vert}$ copies of $A$ with itself is equivalently the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] of the [[free abelian group]] on $I$ with $A$:

$$
  \oplus_{i \in I} A \simeq (\oplus_{i \in I} \mathbb{Z}) \otimes A
  \simeq (\mathbb{Z}[I]) \otimes A
  \,.
$$

### Monoidal and bimonoidal structure
 {#MonoidalAndBipermutativeStructure}

With the definitions and properties discussed above in _[Direct sum, etc.](#DirectSumEtc)_ we have the following

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The category $Ab$ becomes a [[monoidal category]]

1. under [[direct sum]] $(Ab, \oplus, 0)$;

1. under [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $(Ab, \otimes, \mathbb{Z})$.

Indeed with both structures combined we have

* $(Ab, \oplus, \otimes, 0, \mathbb{Z})$ 

is a [[bimonoidal category]] (and can be made a [[bipermutative category]]).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] $(Ab, \otimes, \mathbb{Z})$ is equivalently a [[ring]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A [[monoid]] in $(Ab, \oplus, 0)$ is equivalently just an abelian group again (since $\oplus$ is the [[coproduct]] in $Ab$, so every object has a unique monoid structure with respect to it).

### Enrichment over $Ab$

Categories [[enriched category|enriched]] over $Ab$ are called [[additive category|pre-additive categories]] or sometimes just additive categories.  If they satisfy an extra exactness condition they are called [[abelian category|abelian categories]]. See at _[[additive and abelian categories]]_.
