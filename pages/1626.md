## Idea 

A [[space]] is __connected__ if it can\'t be split up into two independent parts.  On this page we focus on connectedness for [[topological spaces]].

Every topological space can be decomposed into disjoint maximal connected subspaces, called its __connected components__.  The underlying set of a topological space is the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying sets of its connected components, but the space itself is not necessarily the [[coproduct]] of its connected components in the category of spaces.

One often studies topological ideas first for connected spaces and then generalises to general spaces.  This is especially true if one is studying such [[nice topological space]]s that every space *is* a coproduct of connected components (for instance, this is the case for _locally connected_ spaces).


## Definitions 

Speaking category-theoretically a [[topological space]] $X$ is **connected** if the [[representable functor]]
$$ hom(X, -): Top \to Set $$
preserves [[coproduct]]s. It\'s actually enough to require that it preserves binary coproducts (a detailed proof in a more general setting is given at [connected object](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connected+object#reduction_to_binary_coproducts_8)); in that case, notice that we always have a map
$$ hom(X,Y) + hom(X,Z) \to hom(X,Y + Z) ,$$
so $X$ is connected if this is always a [[bijection]]. This definition generalises to the notion of [[connected object]] in an [[extensive category]].

Here are some equivalent ways to say that $X$ is connected in more elementary terms:
* Whenever $X \cong Y + Z$, where the right side is the coproduct of spaces $Y, Z$ (so that $Y, Z$ are identified with disjoint open subspaces of $X$), then exactly one of $Y, Z$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] (so the other is [[empty set|empty]], making the inhabited one homeomorphic to $X$).
* If $K \subseteq X$ is [[clopen set|clopen]] (both closed and open), then $K = X$ if and only if $K$ is inhabited.

Many authors allow the [[empty space]] to be connected.  You can get this concept from the elementary definitions above by changing 'exactly one' to 'at most one' and changing 'if and only if' to 'if'.  Categorially, this version of connectedness requires only that the maps
$$ hom(X,Y) + hom(X,Z) \to hom(X,Y + Z) $$
be [[surjection]]s.  However, many results come out more cleanly by disqualifying the empty space (much as one disqualifies $1$ when one defines the notion of [[prime number]]).  See also the discussion at [[empty space]] and [[too simple to be simple]].

The elementary definitions above have been carefully phrased to be correct in [[constructive mathematics]].  One may also see classically equivalent forms that are constructively weaker.


## Basic results {#basic}

+-- {: .num_remark #1} 
###### Result
The [[image]] of a connected space $X$ under a continuous map $f: X \to Y$ is connected.
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark #2} 
###### Result
[[pushout|Wide pushout]]s of connected spaces are connected. (This would of course be false if the empty space were considered to be connected.) This follows from the hom-functor definition of connectedness, plus the fact that coproducts in $Set$ commute with [[wide pullback]]s. More memorably: [[connected limit|connected colimits]] of connected spaces are connected. 
=--

+-- {: .num_remark #3} 
###### Result
An arbitrary [[product]] of connected spaces is connected. (This relies on some special features of $Top$. Discussion of this point can be found at [connected object](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connected+object#properties_14).)
=--

+-- {: .num_remark #4} 
###### Result
The interval $[0, 1]$, as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$, is connected. (This is the topological underpinning of the [[intermediate value theorem]].)
=--

+-- {: .num_remark #5} 
###### Result
If $S \subseteq X$ is a connected subspace and $S \subseteq T \subseteq \overline{S}$ (i.e. if $T$ is between $S$ and its closure), then $T$ is connected.
=--

## Exotic examples 

The [basic results](basic) above give a plethora of ways to construct connected spaces. More exotic examples are sometimes useful, especially for constructing counterexamples. 

+-- {: .num_example} 
###### Example 
The following, due to [Bing](#Bing), is a countable connected [[Hausdorff space]]. Let $Q = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}: y \geq 0\}$, topologized by defining a basis of neighborhoods $N_{\epsilon, a, b}$ for each point $(a, b) \in Q$ and $\epsilon \gt 0$: 

$$N_{a, b} \coloneqq \{(a, b)\} \cup \{(s, 0) \in Q: {|a + b/\theta - s|} \lt \epsilon\} \cup \{(s, 0) \in Q: {|a - b/\theta - s|} \lt \epsilon\}$$ 

where $\theta \lt 0$ is some chosen fixed irrational number. It is easy to see this space is Hausdorff (using the fact that $\theta$ is irrational). However, the _closure_ of $N_{\epsilon, a, b}$ consists of points $(x, y)$ of $Q \times Q$ with either $(x-a) - \epsilon \leq (y-b)/\theta \leq (x-a) + \epsilon$ or $(x-a) - \epsilon \leq -(y-b)/\theta \leq (x-a) + \epsilon$, in other words, the union of two infinitely long strips of width $2\epsilon$ and slopes $\theta$, $-\theta$. Clearly any two such closures intersect, and therefore the space is connected. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example 
This example is due to [Golomb](#Golomb). Topologize the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ by taking a basis to consist of sets $A_{a,b} \coloneqq \{a k + b | k = 1,2, \ldots\}$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$ are relatively prime. The space is Hausdorff, but the intersection of the closures of two non-empty open sets is never empty, so this space is connected. 
=-- 


## Connected components

Every topological space $X$ admits an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ where $x \sim y$ means that $x$ and $y$ belong to some subspace which is connected. The [[equivalence class]] $Conn(x)$ of an element $x$ is thus the union of all connected subspaces containing $x$; it follows readily from the basic results above that $Conn(x)$ is itself connected. It is called the **connected component** of $x$. It is closed, by one of the basic results above. A space is connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component (or at most one, if you allow the empty space to be connected).

There is another equivalence relation $\sim_q$ where $x \sim_q y$ if $f(x) = f(y)$ for every continuous $f: X \to D$ mapping to a [[discrete space]] $D$. The equivalence class of $x$ may be alternatively described as the intersection of all clopens that contain $x$. This is called the **quasi-component** of $x$, denoted here as $QConn(x)$. It is easy to prove that 

$$Conn(x) \subseteq QConn(x)$$ 

and that equality holds if $X$ is [[compact Hausdorff space|compact Hausdorff]] or is locally connected (see below), but also in other circumstances (such as the space of [[rational numbers]] as a [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]]). 

For an example where $Conn(x) \neq QConn(x)$, take $X$ to be the following [[subspace]] of $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$: 

$$X = \{(0, 0), (0, 1)\} \cup \bigcup_{n \geq 1} \{1/n\} \times [0, 1]$$ 

In this example, $Conn((0, 0)) = \{(0, 0)\}$, but $QConn((0, 0)) = \{(0, 0), (0, 1)\}$. 


## Locally connected spaces

An entry point is given in the following remark/warning: 

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Warning

It is not generally true that a space is the coproduct (in $Top$) of its connected components, nor of its quasi-components. For example, the connected components in [[Cantor space]] $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ (with its topology as a product of 2-point discrete spaces) are just the singletons, but the coproduct of the singleton subspaces carries the discrete topology; another example with this feature is the set of [[rational numbers]] with its absolute-value topology (the one induced as a [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]]).
=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition 
A space $X$ is **locally connected** if it is the coproduct (in $Top$) of its connected components. Equivalently, a space is locally connected if every point has a connected neighborhood. 
=-- 

For example, a space with only finitely many connected components is locally connected (because then each connected component will be both closed and open). [[manifold|Topological manifolds]] are also locally connected. Notice that for locally connected spaces, connected components and quasi-components coincide. 

Let $i \colon LocConn \hookrightarrow Top$ be the full inclusion of locally connected spaces. The following result is straightforward but useful. 

+-- {: .num_theorem #coref} 
###### Theorem 
$LocConn$ is a coreflective subcategory of $Top$, i.e., the inclusion $i$ has a right adjoint $R$. For $X$ a given space, $R(X)$ has the same underlying set as $X$, topologized as the coproduct (in $Top$) of the connected components of $X$. 
=-- 

Being a coreflective category of a complete and cocomplete category, the category $LocConn$ is also complete and cocomplete. Of course, limits and particularly _infinite_ products in $LocConn$ are not calculated as they are in $Top$; rather one takes the limit in $Top$ and _then_ retopologizes it according to \ref{coref}. (For _finite_ products of locally connected spaces, we can just take the product in $Top$ -- the result will be again locally connected.) 

Let $\Gamma \colon LocConn \to Set$ be the underlying set functor, and let $\nabla, \Delta \colon Set \to LocConn$ be the functors which assign to a set the same set equipped with the codiscrete and discrete topologies, respectively. Let $\Pi_0 \colon LocConn \to Set$ be the functor which assigns to a locally connected space the set of its connected components. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
There is a string of adjoints 
$$\Pi_0 \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma \dashv \nabla \colon Set \to LocConn$$ 
and moreover, the functor $\Pi_0$ preserves finite products. 
=-- 

The proof is largely straightforward; we point out that the continuity of the unit $X \to \Delta \Pi_0 X$ is essentially equivalent to the defining property of being locally connected. As for $\Pi_0$ preserving finite products, write locally connected spaces $X$, $Y$ as coproducts of connected spaces 

$$X = \sum_i C_i; \qquad Y = \sum_j D_j;$$ 

then their product in $LocConn$ coincides with their product in $Top$, and is 

$$X \times Y \cong \sum_{i, j} C_i \times D_j$$ 

where each summand $C_i \times D_j$ is connected by Result \ref{3}. From this it is immediate that $\Pi_0$ preserves finite products. 

For related discussions, see [[locally connected topos]], and also [[cohesive topos]]. 

Finally, 

+-- {: .un_defn} 
###### Definition 
A space $X$ is **totally disconnected** if its connected components are precisely the singletons of $X$. 
=-- 

In other words, a space is totally disconnected if its coreflection into $LocConn$ is discrete. Such spaces recur in the study of [[Stone spaces]]. 

## Path-connectedness 

An important variation on the theme of connectedness is path-connectedness. If $X$ is a space, define the path component $[x]$ to be the subspace of all $y \in X$ for which there exists a continuous map $h: [0, 1] \to X$ where $h(0) = x$, $h(1) = y$. 

The set $\pi_0(X)$ of path components (the 0th "[[homotopy group]]") is thus the [[coequalizer]] in 
$$ \hom([0, 1], X) \stackrel{\overset{ev_0}{\to}}{\underset{ev_1}{\to}} \hom(1, X) \to \pi_0(X) .$$ 

Observe that this is a [[reflexive coequalizer]], as witnessed by the mutual right inverse $\hom(!, X): \hom(1, X) \to \hom([0, 1], X)$. 

(We can even topologize $\pi_0(X)$ by taking the coequalizer in $Top$ of 

$$X^{[0, 1]} \stackrel{\overset{ev_0}{\to}}{\underset{ev_1}{\to}} X,$$ 

taking advantage of the fact that the locally compact Hausdorff space $[0, 1]$ is [exponentiable](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/exponential+law+for+spaces). The resulting quotient space will be [[discrete space|discrete]] if $X$ is [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]].)   

We say $X$ is **path-connected** if it has exactly one path component.

It follows easily from the basic results [above](basic) that each path component $[x]$ is connected. However, it need not be closed (and therefore need not be the connected component of $x$); see the following example. The path components and connected components do coincide if $X$ is locally path-connected. 

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example 
The **topologist's sine curve**
$$ \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \;:\; (0 \lt x \leq 1 \;\wedge\; y = sin(1/x)) \;\vee\; (0 = x \;\wedge\; -1 \leq y \leq 1) \} $$
provides a classic example where the path component of a point need not be closed. (Specifically, consider a point on the locus of $y = \sin(1/x)$.) 
=-- 

The basic categorical Results \ref{1}, \ref{2}, and \ref{3} above carry over upon replacing "connected" by "path-connected". (As of course does \ref{4}, trivially.)

As a contrast to a path-connected space, a **totally path-disconnected** space is a space such that its set of path components is equal to the underlying set of the space. Equivalently, that there are no non-constant paths. This by far does not mean that the space is discrete! 

### Path-components functor 

As above, let $\pi_0 \colon Top \to Set$ be the functor which assigns to each space $X$ its set of path components $\pi_0(X)$. 

+-- {: .un_prop} 
###### Proposition 
The functor $\pi_0 \colon Top \to Set$ preserves arbitrary products. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $X_i$ be a family of spaces; we must show that the comparison map 

$$\pi_0(\prod_i X_i) \to \prod_i \pi_0(X_i)$$ 

is invertible. Define a relation $R$ from $\prod_i \pi_0(X_i)$ to $\pi_0(\prod_i X_i)$ where $R((c_i), [(x_i)])$ if $x_i \in c_i$ for all $i$. This is well-defined, because if $x_i \in c_i$ and $y_i \in c_i$ for all $i$, then for each $i$ we can choose a path $\alpha_i \colon I \to X_i$ connecting $x_i$ to $y_i$, and $\langle \alpha_i \rangle \colon I \to \prod_i X_i$ then connects $(x_i)$ to $(y_i)$. (This of course uses the [[axiom of choice]].) It is also total, again by the axiom of choice. It is straightforward that this functional relation is inverse to the comparison map above. 
=-- 

An elegant proof of the previous proposition but for preservation of _finite_ products is as follows: both $\hom(I, -)$ and $\hom(1, -)$ preserve products, and a [[reflexive coequalizer]] of product-preserving functors $C \to Set$, being a [[sifted colimit]], is also product-preserving. 

+-- {: .un_prop} 
###### Proposition 
The functor $\pi_0 \colon Top \to Set$ preserves arbitrary coproducts. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The functor $\hom(I, -) \colon Top \to Set$ preserves coproducts since $I$ is connected, and similarly for $\hom(1, -)$. The coequalizer of a pair of natural transformations between coproduct-preserving functors is also a coproduct-preserving functor.
