Crystal bases are a construction in the [[representation theory]] of [[quantum groups]] (which in a specialization exist hence for usual [[Lie groups]] as well): roughly speaking they provide a uniform description notonly of irreducible finite-dimensional modules but also a uniform choice of bases in all of them as well as in tensor products. 

There are two mutually dual versions due [[Masaki Kashiwara]] and [[George Lusztig]]. 

# History and references

The terminology is due to the involved $q=0$ limit of quantum groups used in the construction (the classical case is $q=1$). In a thermodynamic parlance zero temperature would involve passing to crystalization.
