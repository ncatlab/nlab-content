**Abduction** is a process whereby one reasons to the truth of an explanation from its ability to account for what is observed. It is therefore sometimes also known as **inference to the best explanation**.

[[Charles Peirce]], the originator of the term, illustrated the differences between [[deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and abduction by the following example.

* **Deduction**
: All beans in that bag are white.
: These beans are from that bag.
: Therefore, these beans are white.


* **Induction**
: These beans are from that bag.
: These beans are white.
: Therefore, all beans in that bag are white.


* **Abduction**
: These beans are white.
: All beans in that bag are white.
: Therefore, these beans are from that bag.
