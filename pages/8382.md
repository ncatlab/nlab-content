
**Abductive** [[reasoning]] is a process whereby one reasons to the truth of an explanation from its ability to account for what is observed. It is therefore sometimes also known as **inference to the best explanation**.

[[Charles Peirce]], the originator of the term, illustrated the differences between [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and abduction by the following example.

* **Deduction**
  * All beans in that bag are white.
  * These beans are from that bag.
  * Therefore, these beans are white.


* **Induction**
  * These beans are from that bag.
  * These beans are white.
  * Therefore, all beans in that bag are white.


* **Abduction**
  * These beans are white.
  * All beans in that bag are white.
  * Therefore, these beans are from that bag.

It is not completely clear what Peirce meant by abduction, which he also termed *retroduction*. Clearly the inference cannot be to just any explanation, e.g., there might have been many other bags full of white beans. But before we decide what constitutes a **best** explanation, we had been inquire into the nature of explanation itself.

There is an extensive literature about explanation in the Philosophy of Science, for example, ([FourDecades](#FourDecades)). Obviously it is not just a matter of devising a statement which has the thing to be explained (explicandum) as a consequence. You want it to 'give the reason for' the observation. A thorough account of what constitutes the 'reason' for something is notoriously difficult to formulate. For some, it is a matter of subsuming the observation under a general covering law, while for others, it is a matter of giving a causal or mechanistic story with the observation as the outcome. 
Note also that there is a growing literature now on the concept of 'explanatory proofs' in mathematics, it being felt that one may have proved a mathematical fact without understanding 'why' it is true.

For some, abduction for Peirce is the creative process of coming up with a good explanation. Otherwise, if it is merely a case of assessing a range of existing rival hypotheses as explanations, it may be possible to employ [[Bayesian reasoning]], generally taken to be a form of [[inductive reasoning]].
