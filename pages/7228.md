###### Definition

A [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[topological group]] $G$ is called **[[almost connected topological group|almost connected]]** if the [[quotient]] [[topological space]] $G/G_0$ (of $G$ by the [[connected component]] of the neutral element) is  [[compact topological space|compact]].

See for instance ([Hofmann-Morris, def. 4.24](#HofmannMorris)).

###### Example

Every [[compact topological space|compact]] and every [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological group]] is almost connected.

Also every [[quotient]] of an almost connected group is almost connected.
