## Idea

The concept of _colimit_ is that [[duality|dual]] to a [[limit]]:

a colimit of a [[diagram]] is, if it exists, the [[representable functor|co-classifying space]] for morphisms _out_ of that diagram.

We have

* the notion of _colimit_ generalizes the notion of (direct) _sum_;

* the notion of _weighted colimit_ generalizes the notion of _weighted (direct) sum_.

(There are more remarks on this listed at [[nInsights]]).

Sometimes colimits (or some colimits) are called _inductive limits_ or _direct limits_; see the discussion of terminology at [[limit]].


## Definition

A [[colimit]] in a category $C$ is the same as a [[limit]] in the [[opposite category]], $C^{op}$.

More precisely, for $F : D^{op} \to C^{op}$ a functor, its [[limit]] $\lim F$ is the colimit of 
$F^{op} : D \to C$.


## Examples

Here are some important examples of colimits:

* A colimit of the [[diagram|empty diagram]] is an [[initial object]].
* A colimit of a diagram consisting of two (or more) objects is their [[coproduct]].
* A colimit of a [[span]] is a [[pushout]].
* A colimit of two (or more) [[parallel morphisms]] is a [[coequalizer]].

## Weighted colimits

A [[weighted colimit]] in $C$ is a 
[[weighted limit]] in $C^{op}$.

## Properties

The properties of colimits are of course [[duality|dual]] to those of [[limit]]s. It is still worthwhile to make some of them explicit.

###### Contravariant Hom sends colimits to limits

For $C$ a [[locally small]] category,
for $F : D \to C$ a functor, for $c \in C$ and object and writing $C(F(-), c) : C \to Set$, we have
$$
  C(colim F, c) \simeq lim C(F(-), c)
  \,.
$$
=--
Depending on how one introduces limits this holds by definition or is an easy consequence. In fact, this is just rewriting the respect of the covariant Hom  of [[limit]]s (as described there) in $C^{op}$ in terms of $C$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    C(colim F, c) & \simeq C^{op}(c, colim F)
    \\
    & \simeq C^{op}(c, lim F^{op})
    \\
    & \simeq lim C^{op}(c, F^{op}(-))
    \\
    & \simeq lim C(F(-), c)
  \end{aligned}
$$

Notice that this actually says that $C(-,-) : C^{op} \times C \to Set$ is a [[continuous functor]] in both variables: in the first it sends limits in $C^{op}$ and hence equivalently colimits in $C$ to limits in $Set$.

###### Proposition -- left adjoints commute with colimits

Let $L : C \to C'$ be a functor that is [[left adjoint]] to some functor $R : C' \to C$. Let $D$ be a [[small category]] such that $C$ admits limits of shape $D$. Then $L$ commutes with $D$-shaped colimits in $C$ in that

for $F : D \to C$ some diagram, we have
$$
  L(colim F) \simeq colim (L \circ F)
  \,.
$$
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof

Using the adjunction isomorphism and the above fact that commutes with limits in both arguments, one obtains for every $c' \in C'$
$$
\begin{aligned}
  C'(L (colim F), c) & \simeq C(colim F, R(c'))
  \\
  & \simeq lim C(F(-), R(c')) 
  \\
  & \simeq lim C'(L \circ F(-), c')
  \\
  & \simeq C'(colim (L \circ F), c') 
  \,.
\end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since this holds naturally for every $c'$, the [[Yoneda lemma|Yoneda lemma, corollary II]] on uniqueness of representing objects implies that $R (lim F) \simeq lim (R \circ F)$.
