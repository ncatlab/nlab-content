In a [[category]] $C$ a diagram of morphisms of $C$ 
$$U \underoverset{b}{a}{\rightrightarrows} V \overset{c}{\rightarrow} X $$
is called a **coequalizer** diagram if 
1. $c a=c b$; and 
1. $c$ is universal for this property: i.e. if $f: V \to Y$ is a morphism of $C$ such that $f a=f b$, then there is a unique morphism $f': X \to Y$ such that $f'c=f$. 

This concept is a special case of that of [[colimit]]; specifically, its the colimit of the diagram
$$U \underoverset{b}{a}{\rightrightarrows} V .$$
