## Idea

For $C$ a [[category]] with [[finite limit]]s, a _ring object_ in $C$ is a [[ring]] [[internalization|internal]] to $C$.

This is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group object]] equipped with the structure of a [[monoid|monoid object]] internal to abelian group objects internal to $C$.

## Examples

* A [[topos]] equipped with a ring object is called a [[ringed topos]], see there for more details.
