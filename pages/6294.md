## Idea

For $C$ a [[category]] with [[finite limit]]s, an __internal ring__ or a __ring object__ in $C$ is an [[internalization]] to the category $C$ of a notion of a [[ring]].

This is a [[monoid|monoid object]] internal to the category of  [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group object]]s internal to $C$.

It can be defined in more general symmetric monoidal categories as the corresponding module over a ring operad. 

## Examples

* A [[topos]] equipped with a ring object is called a [[ringed topos]], see there for more details.
