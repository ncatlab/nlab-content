Hello, and welcome to the nLab!

Your recent edit on the theory of primes seems rather out of place here; see the [[HomePage]] and the [[About]] page to see what we do.

We do have an entry on [[prime numbers]] that you might contribute to, but if what you have to say is not related to our interests, then it would probably fit better on another site.
