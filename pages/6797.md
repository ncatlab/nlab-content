## Idea

The [[target space]] spectrum of the [[string]] [[sigma-model]] contains  beyond the massless particles of the [[effective QFT|effective]] [[supergravity]] theory an infinite tower of massive excitations, of ever higher [[spin]]. There are, however, certain limits in which all these masses become negligible to a reference energy scale, notably for compactifications on [[anti de Sitter space]]s of small radius. In this limit the string spectrum looks like a an infinite collection of massless [[spinning particle]]s for ever higher spin. Due to their common orgin in the string, these share intricate relations among each other, which are described by what [Vasiliev](Vasiliev) termed **higher spin gauge theory**.
