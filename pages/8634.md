## Idea

The _localization_ of a commutative [[ring]] $R$ at a [[set]] $S$ of its [[elements]] is a new ring $R[S]^{-1}$ in which the elements of $S$ become invertible ([[unit|units]]) and which is [[universal property|universal]] with this property. 

When interpreting a ring under [[Isbell duality]] as the ring of functions on some [[space]] $X$, then localizing it at $S$ corresponds to restricting to the subspace $Y \hookrightarrow X$ on which the elements in $S$ vanish.

See also [[commutative localization]] and [[localization of a ring]] (noncommutative). 

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Let $S \hookrightarrow U(R)$ be a [[subset]] of the underlying set.

###### Definition

The **localization** $L_S \colon R \to R[S^{-1}]$ is a homomorphism to another commutative ring $R[S^{-1}]$ such that 

1. for all elements $s \in S \hookrightarrow R$ the image $L_S(s) \in R[S^{-1}]$ is invertible (is a [[unit]]);

1. for every other homomorphism $R \to \tilde R$ with this property, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] $R[S^{-1}] \to \tilde R$ such that we have a [[commuting diagram]]

   $$
     \array{
       R &\stackrel{L_S}{\to}& R[S^{-1}]
       \\
       & \searrow & \downarrow
       \\
       && \tilde R
     }
     \,.
   $$
