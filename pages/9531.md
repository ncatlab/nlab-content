## Idea

A [[set]] equipped with a [[permutation representation]] of a ([[discrete group|discrete]]) [[group]] $G$.

## Examples

* A $\mathbb{Z}_2$-set is a set equipped with an [[involution]].

* Any [[permutation]] $\pi : X \to X$ gives $X$ the structure of a $\mathbb{Z}$-set, with the action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $X$ defined by iterated composition of $\pi$ or $\pi^{-1}$.

* $G$ is itself a $G$-set via the (left or right) [[regular representation]]. 

* A [[normal subgroup]] $N \lhd G$ defines a $G$-set by the action of [[conjugation]].

* For $G$ a [[finite group]] then [[Mackey functors]] on [[finite set|finite]] $G$-sets are equivalent to genuine [[G-spectra]].
