## Idea

Canonical extension provides an algebraic formulation of [[duality]] theory and a tool to derive representation theorems. It may be regarded as an algebraic formulation of [[Stone duality]] (see [Gehrke-Vosmaer, p. 5](#GehrkeVosmaer)).

Originally ([Jonsson-Tarski](#JonssonTarski)) is was formulated for [[Boolean algebras]] with operators, but the notion was later generalized to [[distributive lattices]] and even to arbitrary [[posets]].

## Definition

### For distributive lattices

Given a [[distributive lattice]] $L$, its **canonical extension** $L^\delta$ is the [[downset]] [[lattice]] of the [[poset]] of [[prime filters]] of $L$, ordered by inclusion.

This construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  (-)^\delta : DistLattice \to DistLattice^+
$$

from the [[category]] of [[distributive lattices]] to that of [[completely distributive lattice|completely distributive]] [[algebraic lattices]]. This is [[left adjoint]] to the corresponding [[forgetful functor]], exhibiting [[completely distributive algebraic lattices]] as a [[reflective subcategory]] of the distributive lattices

$$
  DistLattice^+ \stackrel{\overset{(-)^\delta}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  DistLattice
  \,.
$$

### For Heyting algebras

The canonical extension $L^\delta$ of a [[distributive lattice]] $L$ is a [[complete lattice|complete]] and [[completely distributive lattice]].

In particular the canonical extension is a [[Heyting algebra]]. If $L$ is itself already a Heyting algebra, then $e_L : L \to L^\delta$ preserves the Heyting [[implication]]. Also, canonical extension preserves homomorphisms of Heyting algebras. Hence it restricts to a functor

$$
  (-)^\delta : HeytingAlgebra \to HeytingAlgebra
  \,.
$$
