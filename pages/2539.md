## Summary

The _Tietze extension theorem_ says that [[continuous functions]] [[extension|extend]] from [[closed subsets]] of a [[normal topological space]] $X$ to the whole space $X$. 

This is a close cousin of [[Urysohn's lemma]] with many applications.

One implication is that [[topological vector bundles]] over a topological space $X$ that trivialize over a [[closed subspace]] $A$ are equivalent to vector bundles on the [[quotient space]] $X/A$ (see [there](topological+vector+bundle#OverClosedSubspaces)). This in turn is what implies the [[long exact sequence in cohomology]] for [[topological K-theory]] (see [there](topological+K-theory#ExactSequences)).



## Statement 

### For topological spaces


+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For $X$ a [[normal topological space]] and $A \subset X$ a [[closed subspace]], there is for every [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ to the [[real line]] (with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]) a continuous function $\hat f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ extending it, i.e. such that $\hat f|_A = f$:

$$
  \array{
     A &\hookrightarrow & X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \hat f} } 
     \\
     \mathbb{R}
  }
$$

Therefore one also says that _$\mathbb{R}$ is an [[absolute extensor]]_ in [[topology]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First assume that $f$ is a [[bounded function]], so that there exists a bound $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\underset{a \in A}{\forall} {\vert f(a)\vert} \leq c$. 

We produce a [[sequence]] of approximations to the desired extension by [[induction]]. Then we will observe that the sequence is a [[Cauchy sequence]] and conclude by observing that this implies that it [[limit of a sequence]] is an extension of $f$ as desired.

To start the induction, define the [[pre-images]]

$$
  E_0 \coloneqq f^{-1}( (-\infty, -c/3] )
  \phantom{AAAA}
  F_0 \coloneqq f^{-1}( [c/3, \infty) )
  \,.
$$

Since the subsets $(-\infty,-c/3], [8c/3,\infty) \subset \mathbb{R}$ are [[closed subsets]], and since $f$ is a [[continuous function]], these are [[closed subsets]] of $A$.

### For smooth manifolds {#Manifolds}

See _[[Whitney extension theorem]]_, also _[[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]]_.

### For smooth loci 

Let $\mathbb{L} = (C^\infty Ring^{fin})^{op}$ be the category of [[smooth loci]],
the [[opposite category]] of finitely generated [[generalized smooth algebra]]s.
By the theorem discussed there, there is a [[full and faithful functor]]
[[Diff]] $\hookrightarrow \mathbb{L}$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $A = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/J$ and $B = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/I$
with $I \subset J$ and $B \to A$ the projection of [[generalized smooth algebra]]s
the corresponding [[monomorphism]] $\ell A \to \ell B$ in $\mathbb{L}$ 
exhibits $\ell A$ as a **closed smooth sublocus** of $\ell B$.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and let $\{g_i \in C^\infty(X)\}_{i = 1}^n$ be [[smooth function]]s that are independent in the sense that at each common zero point $x\in X$, $\forall i : g_i(x)= 0$ we have the [[derivative]] $(d g_i) : T_x X \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a surjection, then the ideal $(g_1, \cdots, g_n)$ coincides with the ideal of functions that vanish on the zero-set of the $g_i$.

=--

This is lemma 2.1 in Chapter I of ([MoerdijkReyes](#MoerdijkReyes)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $\ell A \hookrightarrow \ell B$  is a closed
sublocus of $\ell B$ then every morphism $\ell A \to R$
extends to a morphism $\ell B \to R$


=--

This is prop. 1.6 in Chapter II of ([MoerdijkReyes](#MoerdijkReyes)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Since we have $R = \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ and $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$
is the free [[generalized smooth algebra]] on a single generator,
a morphism $\ell A \to R$ is precisely an element of $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/J$.
This is represented by an element in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ which in particular
defines an element in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/I$.
