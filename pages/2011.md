## Idea

__Differential topology__ is the subject devoted to the study of [[topology|topological]] properties of [[smooth manifold]]s and closely related spaces like [[stratifold]]s, [[orbifold]]s and more general [[differentiable stacks]]. It is also concerned with the problem of finding out which topological (or PL) manifolds allow a 
[[smooth structure|differentiable structure]] and the degree of nonuniqueness of that structure if they do. It is also concerned with concrete constructions of [[cohomology|(co)]][[homology]] classes (e.g. [[characteristic class]]es) for differentiable manifolds and of [[differential cohomology|differential refinements of cohomology theories]]. 

## Examples

Many considerations, and classification problems, depend crucially on [[dimension]], and the case of high-dimensional manifolds (the notion of 'high' depends on the problem) is often very different from the situation in each of the low dimensions; thus there are specialists' subjects like $3$-(dimensional) topology and $4$-topology. There are restrictions on an underlying topology which is allowed for some sorts of additional structures on a differentiable manifold. 


For example, only some even-dimensional differentiable manifolds allow for [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] and only some odd-dimensional one allow for a [[contact manifold|contact structure]]; in these cases moreover special constructions of topological invariants like [[Floer homology]] and [[symplectic field theory]] exist.

This yields the relatively young subjects of symplectic and contact topologies, with the first significant results coming from Gromov. Any (Hausdorff paracompact finite-dimensional) differentiable manifold allows for [[Riemannian manifold|riemannian structure]] however; therefore there is no special subject of 'riemannian topology'.

## References

Though some of the basic results, methods and conjectures of differential topology go back to [Poincar√©](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9), Whitney, Morse and Pontrjagin, it became an independent field only in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the seminal works of Smale, Thom, Milnor and Hirsch.
