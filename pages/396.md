## Definition

A **full and faithful functor** is a [[functor]] which is both [[full functor|full]] and [[faithful functor|faithful]].  "Full and faithful" is sometimes shortened to "fully faithful" or "ff."   See also [[subcategory]].

## Properties

Together with [[bo functor|bijective-on-objects functors]], ff functors form an [[bo-ff factorization system|orthogonal factorization system]] on $Cat$. Less [[evil]]ly, pair them with [[essentially surjective functor]]s to get a bicategorial factorization system.


## Higher categorical generalizations

There is a bigger pattern at work here which is indicated at [[stuff, structure, property]] and [[k-surjective functor]].

For [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] the corresponding notion of fully faithful functor is described at

* [[fully faithful (∞,1)-functor]]
