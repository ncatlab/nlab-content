######Definition 
The ring of **Hahn series** with value group $G$, denoted $k[x^G]$, is the ring of functions $f: G \to k$ such that $\{x \in G: f(x) \neq 0\}$ is a well-ordered subset of $G$. Addition is defined pointwise, and multiplication is defined by convolution product: 
$$(f \cdot g)(x) = \sum_{y+z = x in G} f(y)g(z)$$
The [[valuation ring|multiplicative valuation]] $v(f)$ is the least $x \in G$ for which $f(x) \neq 0$.

We obtain a valuation ring from this construction since a valuation ring determines and is determined by a valuation on a field.

######Theorem 
The ring $k[x^G]$ is a field. If $k$ is algebraically closed, then $k[x^G]$ is algebraically closed provided that $G$ is [[divisible group|divisible]]. 
=-- 

As a corollary, if $G$ is divisible, $k[x^G]$ is real closed if $k$ is real closed. This is because the adjunction of a square root of $-1$ would make $k[x^G]$ algebraically closed, since this gives the same result as constructing the Hahn series over the algebraically closed field $k[\sqrt{-1}]$.
