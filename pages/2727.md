
In [[type theory]], the paradigm of __propositions as types__ says that a [[proposition]] and a [[type]] are the same thing.  A proposition is identified with its type of proofs, and a type is identified with the proposition that it has an element.

Not all type theories follow this paradigm; among those that do, those of [[Per Martin-LÃ¶f]] are the most famous.  However, there is still a close relationship between logical and type-theoretic operations, called the __Curry--Howard isomorphism__ or (if it is not clear in which category this [[isomorphism]] is supposed to exist) the __Curry--Howard correspondence__.  This correspondence is most precise for [[intuitionistic logic]].
