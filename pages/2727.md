## Idea

In [[type theory]], the paradigm of __propositions as types__ says that a [[proposition]] and a [[type]] are the same thing.  A proposition is identified with its type of proofs, and a type is identified with the proposition that it has an element.  

Not all type theories follow this paradigm; among those that do, [[Martin-Löf type theories]] are the most famous.

Even when the paradigm is not adopted, however, there is still a close relationship between logical and type-theoretic operations, called the __Curry--Howard isomorphism__ or (if it is not clear in which category this [[isomorphism]] is supposed to exist) the __Curry--Howard correspondence__.  This correspondence is most precise and well-developed for [[intuitionistic logic]].

Accordingly, [[logic]]al operations on propositions have immediate analogs on [[type]]s. For instance logical [[and]] coresponds to [[product]] types $A \times B$ (a proof of $A$ and a proof of $B$), the forall [[quantifier]] corresponds to [[dependent product]], the existential quantifier to [[dependent sum]].

A related paradigm may be called **propositions as some types**, in which propositions are identified with particular types, but not all types are regarded as propositions.  Generally, the propositions are the "types with at most one inhabitant".  This is the paradigm usually used in the [[internal logic]] of categories such as [[toposes]], as well as in [[homotopy type theory]].  In this case, the type-theoretic operations on types either restrict to the propositions to give logical operations (for [[conjunction]], [[implication]], and the [[universal quantifier]]), or have to be "reflected" therein (for [[disjunction]] and the [[existential quantifier]]).  The reflector operation is called a [[bracket type]].


## Curry--Howard in homotopy type theory

In [[homotopy type theory]] where types may be thought of as [[∞-groupoid]]s (or rather [[∞-stack]]s, more generally), we may think for $A$ any type of

* the [[object]]s of $A$ are proofs of some proposition;

* the [[morphism]]s of $A$ are equivalences between these proofs;

* the [[2-morphisms]] of $A$ are equivalences between these equivalences, and so on.

So in terms of the notion of [[n-connected object of an (infinity,1)-topos|n-connected]] and [[truncated|n-truncated objects in an (∞,1)-category]] we have 

* if $A$ is [[(-1)-connected]] then the corresponding proposition is [[true]]; 

* if $A$ is [[(-2)-truncated]] (a [[(-2)-groupoid]]) then the corresponding proposition is true by a unique proof which is uniquely equivalent to itself, etc.;

* if $A$ is [[(-1)-truncated]] (a [[(-1)-groupoid]]) then the corresponding proposition may be true or [[false]], but if it is true it is to by a unique proof as above;

* if $A$ is [[0-truncated]] then there may be more than one proof, but none equivalent to itself in an interesting way;

* if $A$ is [[1-truncated]] then there may be proofs of the corresponding proposition that are equivalent to themselves in interesting ways.

We would not say homotopy type theory has propositions as types in the same way that Martin--Löf type theory has; only the $(-1)$-truncated types are propositions as such.  That is, in HoTT we have propositions as *some* types.  In this case the [[bracket types]] can be identified with a particular [[higher inductive type]] called $isInhab$.
