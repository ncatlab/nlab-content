## Definition

In the context of [[Goodwillie calculus]], an [[(∞,1)-functor]] is called $n$-reduced for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \gt 0$, if its [(n-1)-excisive approximation](n-excisive+functor#nExcisiveApproximation) is trivial, $P_{n-1} F \simeq \ast$ (hence if it is a $P_{n-1}$ [[anti-modal type]]).

(e.g. [Lurie, def. 6.1.2.1](#HigherAlg))

Hence a functor is 1-reduced (or just _reduced_, for short), if $F(\ast) \simeq \ast$.

A functor that is both [[n-excisive functor|n-excisive]] and $n$-reduced is called an  _[[n-homogeneous (∞,1)-functor]]_.
