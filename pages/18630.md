$\,$

This chapter introduces the basic concepts of _[[Lagrangian field theory]]_, first for [[prequantum field theory]] and then for its [[deformation quantization]] to [[perturbative quantum field theory]].

In full beauty these concepts are extremely general; but the aim here is to give a first good idea of the subject, not
a fully general account.

Therefore we present in the following only the special case where [[spacetime]] is [[Minkowski spacetime]], the [[field bundle]] (def. \ref{Fields} below) is an ordinary [[trivial vector bundle]] and hence the [[Lagrangian  density]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below) is globally defined. We do however consider the proper [[differential geometry]] of the resulting [[spaces of field histories]] in  terms of [[smooth sets]] (see [below](#Geometry)) and hence (which works verbatim the same way) [[super smooth sets]]. This subsumes the
case that there are [[fermion|fermionic]] fields such that the [[field bundle]] is a [[supermanifold]].
(Notice that this does _not_ mean that we consider "[[supersymmetry]]": plain [[supergeometry]] is just the mathematical
incarnation of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermions]]. )

This comparatively simple setup already subsumes what is considered in most traditional texts on the subject. In subsequent sections we will eventually discuss more general situations, where spacetime is allowed to be [[globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold]] and the [[field bundle]] to be a [[super L-infinity algebra|super]]-[[derived Lie algebroid]]. This is then sufficient generality to capture the established perturbative [[BV formalism|BRST-BV quantization]] of [[gauge fields]] coupled to [[fermions]] [[AQFT on curved spacetime|on curved spacetimes]].
Further generalization, necessary for the discussion of global topological effects such as [[instanton]] configurations
of [[gauge fields]] will be discussed elsewhere.

Throughout we use the case of the real [[scalar field]] as an illustrative running example, which we develop alongside with the theory. The discussion of other types of [[field (physics)|fields]] that are of more genuine interest in applications is postponed to their dedicated chapters below.


## Geometry
 {#Geometry}

In [[field theory]] one is concerned with [[differential geometry]] on
[[spaces]] that are more general than [[smooth manifolds]] in several ways (a preview is in remark \ref{PreviewOfGenerlizedDifferentialGeometryAppearingInFieldTheory} below). The right concept
that neatly supports the necessary differential geometry turns out to be that of _[[smooth sets]]_
and their [[super formal smooth infinity-groupoid|generalization]] to [[supergeometry|super]]-, [[formal geometry|formal]]- and [[higher differential geometry]]. Hence before introducing the idea of fields below, here we briefly spend
some words on required concepts from [[differential geometry]]. For a self-contained introduction see at
_[[geometry of physics]]_ beginning with the chapter _[[geometry of physics -- smooth sets]]_
and including the chapter _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_.

While the concept of _[[smooth sets]]_ is not advertised in traditional textbooks, it is actually simpler than
that of smooth manifolds and it is closer to the operational nature of physics:

A [[smooth set]] $X$ is defined simply by specifying, in a self-consistent way, what counts as a smooth function $U \to X$ (a "plot") from any [[Cartesian space]] $U$ ("[[coordinate systems]]"). Given two smooth sets $X$ and $Y$ then a [[smooth function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
between them is a function that takes plots $U \overset{\phi}{\to} X$ of $X$ to plots $f \circ \phi \colon U \to Y$ of $Y$.
If we allow $U$ here to be a [[super Cartesian space]], then the same idea defines _[[super smooth sets]]_.
We will write $\mathbf{H}$ for the resulting differential geometric [[category]] of [[smooth sets]] or more generally
[[super formal smooth sets]].

A key example of a smooth set which is in general not a [[smooth manifold]] is the [[mapping space]] $[X,Y]$ between two smooth sets $X$ and $Y$, hence the set of all smooth functions $X \to Y$ equipped with a smooth structure itself. Namely a plot $\phi_{(-)} \colon U \to [X,Y]$ is defined to be a smooth function $\phi_{(-)}(-) \colon U \times X \to Y$ out of the [[Cartesian product]] of $U$ with $X$ to $Y$,  hence a "U-parameterized smooth family of smooth functions on $\Sigma$".

An example of a smooth set which is far from being a smooth manifold is for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the smooth set $\mathbf{\Omega}^n$ which is the "smooth [[classifying space]]" for [[differential n-forms]], defined by the rule that a smooth function $\phi \colon U \to \mathbf{\Omega}^n$ is equivalently a smooth differential $n$-form on $U$ (to be thought of as the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] of a "universal $n$-form" on $\mathbf{\Omega}^n$ along $\phi$).
It follows from this in particular that for $X$ any [[smooth manifold]] then smooth functions $X \to \mathbf{\Omega}^n$ are equivalent to smooth $n$-forms on $X$. Accordingly we may say that for $X$ any [[smooth set]] (which may be far from being a smooth manifold) then a differential $n$-form on $X$ is equivalently a smooth function $X \to \mathbf{\Omega}^n$. Under this identification the operation of [[pullback of differential forms]] along some smooth function $f \colon Y \to X$ is just [[composition]] of smooth functions $f^\ast \omega \colon Y \overset{f}{\to} X \overset{\omega}{\to} \mathbf{\Omega}^n$.

These examples may be combined: the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma, \mathbf{\Omega}^n]$ is a kind of smooth classifying space for differential forms _on_ $\Sigma$: a smooth function $\omega_{(-)} \colon U \to [\Sigma,\mathbf{\Omega}^n]$ into this space is, by the above, a [[differential n-form]] on the [[Cartesian product]] $U \times \Sigma$.

This is very convenient for discussion of _[[transgression of differential forms]]_, which
is a process that controls much of [[Lagrangian field theory]] below:

Given a [[differential form]] $\omega$ of degree $n$ on some [[smooth space]] $X$ and given a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma$ of [[dimension]] $k \leq n$, then there is canonically induced a differential form $\tau_\Sigma \omega$ of degree $n-k$ on the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma, X]$: its restriction to any smooth family $\Phi_{(-)}$ of smooth functions $\Phi_u \colon \Sigma \to X$ is the result of first forming the [[pullback of differential forms]] of $\omega$ along $\Phi_{(-)}$ and then forming the [[integration of differential forms]] of the result over $\Sigma$:

$$
  \tau_{\Sigma} \omega\vert_{\Phi_{(-)}}
    \coloneqq
  \int_\Sigma (\Phi_{(-)})^\ast \omega
  \,.
$$

This differential form $\tau_\Sigma \omega$ on the mapping space
is called the _[[transgression of differential forms|transgression]]_ of $\omega$ with respect to $\Sigma$.

We will need the following basic fact about transgression:


+-- {: .num_prop #RelativeTransgressionOfDifferentialForms}
###### Proposition
**(relative [[transgression of differential forms]] over [[manifolds with boundary]])**

1. $X$ be a [[smooth set]];

1. $\Sigma_k$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$ with [[manifold with boundary|boundary]] $\partial \Sigma$

1. $n \geq k \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. $\omega \in \Omega^n_{X}$ a [[closed differential form]].

Write

$$
  (-)\vert_{\partial \Sigma}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  [\partial \Sigma \hookrightarrow \Sigma, X]
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma, X]
   \longrightarrow
  [\partial \Sigma, X]
$$

for the smooth function that restricts smooth functions on $\Sigma$ to smooth functions on the [[boundary]] $\partial \Sigma$.

Then the operations of transgression of differential forms (def. \ref{TransgressionOfDifferentialFormsToMappingSpaces}) to $\Sigma$ and to $\partial \Sigma$, respectively, are related by


$$
  d \left(
    \tau_{\Sigma}(\omega)
  \right)
  =
  (-1)^{k+1}
  ((-)\vert_{\partial \Sigma})^\ast \tau_{\partial \Sigma}(\omega)
    \phantom{AAAAAAAA}
  \array{
    [\Sigma, X]
      &\overset{ \tau_{\Sigma}(\omega) }{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{n-k}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(-)\vert_{\partial \Sigma} }}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ (-1)^{k+1} d}}
    \\
    [\partial \Sigma, X]
      &\underset{ \tau_{\partial\Sigma}(\omega) }{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{n-k+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

In particular this means that if the compact manifold $\Sigma$ happens to have no boundary (is a [[closed manifold]]) then transgression over $\Sigma$ takes closed differential forms to closed differential forms.

###### Remark
**(preview of generalized differential geometry appearing in field theory)**

While we introduce many of the following terms from field theory only further below, some
readers may appreciate a quick preview of where in field theory differential geometry
beyond smooth manifolds appears:

The very _[[space of field histories]]_ of a field theory, hence the space of all ways
in which fields may behave in [[spacetime]], is a [[space of sections]] (namely of the "[[field bundle]]"),
which is akin to the [[mapping space]] of all [[smooth functions]] from [[spacetime]] to a "[[field fiber]]" space.
Even in rare cases where this [[space of trajectories]] happens to admit the structure of an [[infinite-dimensional manifold]]
(such as when the [[field fiber]] happens to be a [[smooth manifold]] and when one restricts attention to a [[compact subset]] of spacetime, see at _[[manifold structure of mapping spaces]]_) this structure may be unwieldy for the purposes of the theory.
For instance in order to handle [[differential forms]] on mapping spaces (such as the [[presymplectic form]]
on the "[[shell]]" inside the [[space of trajectories]] which constitutes the [[phase space]] of the theory), it
is sufficient just to know which
functions from [[Cartesian spaces]] (i.e. from [[coordinate systems]]) into the mapping spaces are [[smooth functions]].
This information gives the mapping space the structure of a "[[smooth set]]".

To properly define the [[phase space]] associated with a [[Cauchy surface]] in [[spacetime]],
one needs to consider the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of that Cauchy surface (so that a field restricted
to that infinitesimal neighbourhood is specified by the value of all its spacetime-[[derivatives]] on the Cauchy surface).
Such [[infinitesimal]] aspects of differential geoemtry are captured by "[[formal smooth sets]]".

Generally the "[[field fiber]]" space (and hence the total space of the [[field bundle]]) is not a plain smooth manifold:
if [[fermion|fermionic]] fields are considered, then it is a [[supermanifold]], if [[gauge fields]] are considered then it is
a [[Lie algebroid]] or rather a [[smooth groupoid]], if [[higher gauge fields]] are considered then it is an
[[infinity-Lie algebra]] or rather a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]], and hence if the theory contains both
[[fermion|fermion fields]] as well as [[gauge fields]] (as is the case in examples of [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] interest)
then it is a [[super smooth ∞-groupoid]].

##  Spacetime
  {#Spacetime}

Relativistic field theory takes place in (or on) _[[spacetime]]_. We briefly set up some notations
and conventions:

Throughout, let

$$
  p \in \mathbb{N}
$$

be a [[natural number]] and write

$$
  \Sigma \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^{p,1} \coloneqq (\mathbb{R}^{p+1}, \eta)
$$

for [[Minkowski spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, hence for the [[smooth manifold]] which is the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{p+1}$ of dimension $p+1$ equipped with the [[left invariant differential form|constant]] [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] $\eta$ which at the origin is given by the standard [[quadratic form]] of [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]]

$$
  (-, +, \cdots, +)
$$

in terms of the canonical [[coordinate functions]]

$$
  x^\mu \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{p+1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

which we index starting at zero: $(x^\mu)_{\mu = 0}^p$.

We write

$$
  dvol_\Sigma
   \;\coloneq\;
  d x^0 \wedge d x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p
  \in \Omega^{p+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p,1})
$$

for the induced [[volume form]], and we call

$$
  d x^0 \in \Omega^1(\Sigma)
$$

the canonical representative of the canonical [[time orientation]] on Minkowski spacetime.

We use the [[Einstein summation convention]]: Expressions with repeated indicices indicate [[sum|summation]] over the
range of indices.

For instance a [[differential 1-form]] $\alpha \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p,1})$ on Minkowski spacetime may be expanded as

$$
  \alpha = f_\mu d x^\mu
  \,.
$$


## Fields

A _[[field (physics)|field]] trajectory_ (field history) on a given [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ is meant to be some kind of [[quantity]] assigned to each point of spacetime (each [[event]]), such that this assignment varies smoothly with spacetime points. For instance an _[[electromagnetic field]]_ [[trajectory]] (or "history") is at each point of spacetime a collection of [[vectors]] that encode the direction in which a [[charged particle]] passing through that point will feel a [[force]] (the [[Lorentz force]]).

This is readily formalized: If

$$
  F \in SmthMfd
$$

is the [[smooth manifold]] of "values" that the the given kind of field may take at any spacetime point, then a field configuration $\Phi$ is modeled as a [[smooth function]] from spacetime to this space of values:

$$
  \Phi
    \;\colon\;
   \Sigma
     \longrightarrow
   F
  \,.
$$

It will be useful to unify spacetime and the space of field values into a single space, the [[Cartesian product]]

$$
  E \;\coloneqq\; \Sigma \times F
$$

and to think of this equipped with the [[projection]] map onto the first factor as a [[fiber bundle]] of spaces of field values over spacetime


$$
  \array{
     E &\coloneqq& \Sigma \times F
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{fb}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{pr_1}}
     \\
     \Sigma
  }
  \,.
$$

This is then called the _[[field bundle]]_, which specifies the kind of values that the given field species may take at any point of spacetime. Since the space $F$ of field values is the [[fiber]] of this [[fiber bundle]], it is sometimes also called the _[[field fiber]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn #Fields}
###### Definition
**([[field (physics)|fields]] and their [[space of histories]])**

Given a [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$, then a _[[type]] of [[field|fields]]_ on $\Sigma$
is a [[smooth set|smooth]] [[fiber bundle]]

$$
  \array{E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}} \\ \Sigma }
$$

called the _[[field bundle]]_,

Given a type of [[field|fields]] on $\Sigma$ this way, then a  _[[field (physics)|field]] [[trajectory]]_ (or _field history_) of that type on $\Sigma$
is a smooth  [[section]] of this [[bundle]], namely a [[smooth function]] of the form

$$
  \Phi \colon \Sigma \longrightarrow E
$$

such that composed with the [[projection]] map it is the [[identity function]], i.e. such that

$$
  fb \circ \Phi = id
  \phantom{AAAAAAA}
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\Phi}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma & = & \Sigma
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding _[[space of field histories]]_ is the [[smooth set|smooth]] [[space of sections|space of all these]], to be denoted

$$
  \label{SpaceOfFieldHistories}
  \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \in \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

This is a [[smooth set]] by declaring that a smooth family $\Phi_{(-)}$ of field configurations,
parameterized over any [[Cartesian space]] $U$ is a smooth function

$$
  \array{
    U \times \Sigma &\overset{\Phi_{(-)}(-)}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    (u,x) &\mapsto& \Phi_u(x)
  }
$$

such that for each $u \in U$ we have $p \circ \Phi_{u}(-) = id_\Sigma$, i.e.

$$
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\Phi_{(-)}(-)}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    U \times \Sigma &\underset{pr_2}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma
  }
  \,.
$$


More generally, let $S \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ be a [[submanifold]] of spacetime. We write
$N_\Sigma(S) \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ for its [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] in $\Sigma$.

If $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ is a [[field bundle]]
then the _[[space of histories]] of fields restricted to $S$_, to be denoted

$$
  \label{SpaceOfFieldHistoriesInHigherCodimension}
  \Gamma_{S}(E) \coloneqq \Gamma_{N_\Sigma(S)}( E\vert_{N_\Sigma S} ) \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[space of sections]] restricted to the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] $N_\Sigma(S)$.

There is a canonical [[evaluation]] [[smooth function]]

$$
  \label{FieldEvaluation}
  ev_S
   \;\colon\;
  N_\Sigma S \times \Gamma_{S}(E)
    \longrightarrow
  E
$$

which takes a [[pair]] consisting of an [[generalized element|element]] in $N_\Sigma S$
and a field configuration to the value of the field configuration at that point.

=--

For the time being, not to get distracted from the core idea of
field theory, we will focus on the following simple special case of field bundles:

+-- {: .num_example #TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}
###### Example
**([[trivial vector bundle]] as a [[field bundle]])**

In applications the [[field fiber]] $F$ is often a [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] and equipped with the structure of a [[vector space]]. In this case the trivial field bundle with fiber $F$ is of course a _[[trivial vector bundle|trivial]] [[vector bundle]]_.

Choosing any [[linear basis]] $(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s$ of the field fiber, then over [[Minkowski spacetime]] we have canonical [[coordinates]] on the total space of the field bundle

$$
  ( (x^\mu), ( \phi^a ) )
  \,,
$$

where the index $\mu$ ranges from $0$ to $p$, while the index $a$ ranges from 1 to $s$.

If this trivial vector bundle is regarded as a [[field bundle]] according to def. \ref{Fields}, then
a field configuration $\Phi$ is equivalently an $s$-[[tuple]] of [[real number|real]]-valued [[smooth functions]]
$\Phi^a \colon \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ on spacetime:

$$
  \Phi = ( \Phi^a )_{a = 1}^s
  \,.
$$

=--

The following simplest special case of this simple class of special cases
serves as a good toy example for the general theory:

+-- {: .num_example #RealScalarFieldBundle}
###### Example
**([[field bundle]] for [[real scalar field]])**

If $\Sigma$ is a [[spacetime]] and if the [[field fiber]]

$$
  F \coloneqq \mathbb{R}
$$

is simply the [[real line]], then the corresponding trivial [[field bundle]] (def. \ref{Fields})

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{pr_1}}\downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$

is the _[[trivial fiber bundle|trivial]] [[real line bundle]]_ (a special case of example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) and the corresponding [[field (physics)|field]] type (def. \ref{Fields}) is called the _[[real scalar field]]_ on $\Sigma$. A configuration of this field is simply a [[smooth function]] on $\Sigma$ with values in the [[real numbers]]:

$$
  \Gamma_\Sigma(\Sigma \times \mathbb{R})
    \;\simeq\;
  C^\infty(\Sigma)
  \,.
$$

=--


## Derivatives

Given a [[field bundle]] as in def. \ref{Fields} above, then we know what type of quantities the corresponding fields assign to a given spacetime point ([[event]]). Among all consistent such field configurations, some are to qualify as those that "may occur in reality" if we think of the field theory as a means to describe parts of the [[observable universe]]. Moreover, if the reality to be described does not exhibit "action at a distance" then admissibility of its field configurations should be determined over arbitrary small spacetime regions, in fact over the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of any spacetime point. This means equivalently that the realized field configurations should be those that satisfy a given _[[differential equation]]_, hence an [[equation]] between the value of the [[derivatives]] of the field
configuration at any spacetime point.

In order to formalize this, it is useful to first collect all the possible derivatives that a field may have at any given point into one big space of "field derivatives at spacetime points". This collection is called the _[[jet bundle]]_ of the [[field bundle]], given as def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below.

Moving around in this space means to change the possible value of fields and their derivatives, hence to _vary_ the fields. Accordingly _[[variational calculus]]_ of fields is just [[differential calculus]] on the [[jet bundle]] of the [[field bundle]], this we consider in def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below.


+-- {: .num_defn #JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}
###### Definition
**([[jet bundle]] of a [[trivial vector bundle]] over [[Minkowski spacetime]])**

Given a [[field fiber]] [[vector space]] $F = \mathbb{R}^s$ with [[linear basis]] $(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s$,
then for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ a natural number,  the _order-$k$ [[jet bundle]]_

$$
  \array{
    J^k_{\Sigma}( E )
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{jb_k}}
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$

over [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\Sigma$ of the [[trivial vector bundle]]

$$
  E \coloneqq \Sigma \times F
$$

is the [[Cartesian space]] which is spanned by coordinate functions to be denoted as follows:

$$
  \left(
     (x^\mu)
     \,,\,
     (\phi^a )
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu_1\mu_2} )
     \,,\,
     \cdots
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} )
  \right)
$$

where the indices $\mu, \mu_1, \mu_2, \codts$ range from 0 to $p$, while the index $a$ ranges from $1$ to $s$. In terms of these coordinates the [[bundle]] [[projection]] map $jb_k$ is just the one that remembers the spacetime coordinates $x^\mu$ and forgets the values of the field $\phi^a$ and its derivatives $\phi_{\mu}$. Similarly there are intermediate projection maps

$$
  \array{
    \cdots
     &\overset{jb_{3,2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    J^{2}_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{jb_{2,1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    J^1_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{jb_1}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    && &{}_{\mathllap{jb_2}}\searrow& {}^{\mathllap{jb_1}}\downarrow  &\swarrow_{\mathrlap{fb}}&
    \\
    && && \Sigma &&
  }
$$

given by forgetting coordinates with more indices.

The _infinite-order [[jet bundle]]_

$$
  J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[direct limit]] over these finite order jet bundles,
formed in the [[category]] of [[smooth sets]]. This means that it is the [[smooth set]] which is defined
by the fact that a smooth function

$$
  U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} J^\infty_\Sigma(E)
$$

from some [[Cartesian space]] $U$ is equivalently a system of ordinary smooth functions
into all the finite-order jet spaces

$$

  \left(
    U \overset{f_k}{\longrightarrow} J^k_\Sigma(E)
  \right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}
  \,,
$$

such that this system is compatible with the
above projection maps, i.e. such that

$$
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\forall} \left(
    jb_{k+1,k} \circ f_{k+1} = f_k
  \right)
  \phantom{AAAAAAA}

+-- {: .num_defn #JetProlongation}
###### Definition
**([[jet prolongation]])

The [[smooth function]] from the [[space of sections]] of the original bundle to the space of sections of the jet bundle which records the field $\Phi$ and all its spacetimes [[derivatives]] is called _[[jet prolongation]]_:

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{j^\infty_\Sigma}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma_\Sigma(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
    \\
    (\Phi^a)
    &\mapsto&
    \left(
    \left( \Phi^a \right)
      \,,\,
      \left(  \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu}  \right)
      \,,\,
      \left( \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^a}{\partial x^{\mu_1} \partial x^{\mu_2}}  \right)
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

So the canonical [[coordinates]] on the jet bundle are the spacetime-point-wise _possible_ values of fields and field derivates,
while the [[jet prolongation]] picks the actual collections of field derivatives that may occur for an actual field
configuration.

While the [[jet bundle]] is not [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]],
reflecting the fact that there are arbitrary higher orders of spacetime derivatives of a field configurations,
it turns out that it is only very "mildly [[infinite dimensional manifold|infinite dimensional]]"
in that
smooth  functions on jet bundles turn out to _locally_ depend on only finitely many of the jet coordinates
(i.e. only on a finite order of spacetime derivatives). This is the content
of the following prop. \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold} \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold}.
In practice this means that the situation is very convenient:

1. Any given [[local Lagrangian density]] (which will define a field theory, we come to this in def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below)
   will locally depend on some finite number $k$ of derivatives and may hence locally
   be treated as living on the ordinary manifold $J^k_\Sigma(E)$.

1. while at the same time all formulas (such as for the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]], def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) work uniformly
without worries about fixing a maximal order of derivatives.

**([[jet bundle]] is a [[locally pro-manifold]])**

Given a [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ as in def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime},
then a [[smooth function]] out of it

$$
  J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \longrightarrow X
$$

is such that around each point of $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ there is a [[neighbourhood]] $U \subset J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$
on which it is given by a function on a smooth function on $J^k_\Sigma(E)$ for some finite $k$.

###### Definition
**([[variational derivative]] and [[total derivative|total spacetime derivative]])**

On the [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ of a [[trivial vector bundle]] over [[Minkowski spacetime]] as in def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} we may consider its [[de Rham complex]] of
[[differential forms]]; we write its [[de Rham differential]] in boldface:

$$
  \mathbf{d} \;\colon\; \Omega^\bullet(J^\infty_\Sigma(E)) \longrightarrow \Omega^{\bullet+1}(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
  \,.
$$

Since the jet bundle unified spacetime with field values, we want to decompose this differential into
a contribution coming from forming the [[total derivatives]] of fields along spacetime ("[[horizontal derivatives]]"), and
actual _variation_ of fields at a fixed spacetime point ("[[vertical derivatives]]"):


The  _[[total derivative|total spacetime derivative]]_ or  _[[horizontal derivative]]_ on $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$
is the map on [[differential forms]] on the jet bundle of the form

$$
  d
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{\bullet+1}( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
$$

which on functions $f \colon J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \to \mathbb{R}$ (i.e. on 0-forms) is defined by

$$
  \label{SpacetimeTotalDerivativeOnSmoothFunctions}
  \begin{aligned}
    d f
    & \coloneqq
    \frac{d f}{d x^\mu}
    \mathbf{d} x^\mu
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    \underoverset{\mu = 0}{p}{\sum}
    \left(
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^a}
      \phi^a_{,\mu}
      +
      \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial \phi^a_{,\nu}}
      \phi^a_{,\nu \mu }
      +
      \cdots
    \right)
    \mathbf{d} x^\mu
  \end{aligned}
$$

and extended to all forms by the graded [[Leibniz rule]], hence  as a nilpotent [[derivation]] of degree +1.

The  _[[variational derivative]]_ or _[[vertical derivative]]_

$$
  \delta
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{\bullet+1}( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
$$

is what remains of the full [[de Rham differential]] when the total spacetime derivative ([[horizontal derivative]]) is subtracted:

$$
  \delta \coloneqq \mathbf{d} - d
  \,.
$$

This defines a bigrading on the [[de Rham complex]] of $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$, into horizontal degree $r$ and vertical degree $s$

$$
  \Omega^\bullet\left( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \right)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{r,s}{\oplus} \Omega^{r,s}(E)
$$

such that the horizontal and vertical derivative increase horizontal or vertical degree, respectively:

###### Example
**(basic facts about [[variational calculus]])**

Given the jet bundle of a [[field bundle]] as in def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}, then
in its [[variational bicomplex]] (def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
we have the following:

* The spacetime [[total derivative]] ([[horizontal derivative]]) of a spacetime coordinate function $x^\mu$
  coincides with its ordinary de Rham differential

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      d x^\mu
      & =
      \frac{\partial x^\mu}{ \partial x^\nu} \mathbf{d}x^\nu
      \\
      & = \mathbf{d} x^\mu
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  which hence is a horizontal 1-form

  $$
    \mathbf{d}x^\mu \;\in\; \Omega^{1,0}_\Sigma(E)
    \,.
  $$

* Therefore the variational derivative ([[vertical derivative|vertical derivative]]) of a spacetime coordinate function vanishes:

  $$
    \delta x^\mu = 0
    \,,
  $$

  reflective the fact that $x^\mu$ is not a field coordinate that could be varied.

* In particular the given [[volume form]] on $\Sigma$ gives a horizontal $p+1$-form on the jet bundle,
  which has the same coordinate expression (and which we denote by the same symbol)

  $$
    dvol_\Sigma =  d x^0 \wedge d x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p
     \;\in\;
    \Omega^{p+1,0}
    \,.
  $$

* Generally any horizontal $k$-form is of the form

  $$
    f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} d x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{\mu_k}
    \;\in\;
    \Omega^{k,0}_{\Sigma}(E)
  $$

  for

  $$
    f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} = f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}\left((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots\right)
    \in C^\infty(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
  $$

  any smooth function of the spacetime coordinates and the field coordinates (locally depending only on a finite
  order of these, by prop. \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold}).

* In particular every horizontal $(p+1)$-form $\mathbf{L} \in \Omega^{p+1,0}(E)$ is proportional to the
  above volume form

  $$
    \mathbf{L} = L \, dvol_\Sigma
  $$

  for $L = L((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots)$ some smooth function that may depend on all the
  spacetime and field coordinates.

* The spacetimes [[total derivatives]] /horizontal derivatives) of the variational derivative (vertical derivative) $\delta \phi$ of a field variable is the differential 2-form of horizontal degree 1 and vertical degree 2 given by

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      d (\delta \phi^a)
      & =
      -
      \delta (d \phi_a)
      \\
      & =
      - (\delta \phi^a_{,\mu}) \wedge \mathbf{d} x^\mu
    \end{aligned}
    \,.
  $$

  In words this says that "the spacetime derivative of the variation of the field is the variation of its spacetime derivative".

###### Proposition
**([[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] along [[jet prolongation]] compatible with [[total derivative|total spacetime derivatives]])**

Let $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ be a [[field bundle]] over a [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ (def. \ref{Fields}),
with induced [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$

Then for $\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ any field configuration, the [[pullback of differential forms]]

$$
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
   \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega^\bullet(\Sigma)
$$

along the [[jet prolongation]] of $\Phi$ (def. \ref{JetProlongation}):

1. intertwines the [[de Rham differential]] on [[spacetime]] with the [[total derivative|total]] spacetime derivative ([[horizontal derivative]]) on the [[jet bundle]]:

   $$
     d \circ j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
     \;=\;
     j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ d
     \,.
   $$

1. annihilates all [[vertical differential forms]]

   $$
     j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast\vert_{\Omega^{r, \geq 1}_\Sigma(E)} = 0
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that generally the operation of [[pullback of differential forms]]
along any smooth function intertwines the full [[de Rham differentials]]. In particular
we have on general grounds that

$$
  d \circ j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
  =
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ \mathbf{d}
  \,.
$$

This means that the second statement immediately follows from the
first, by definition of the variational (vertical) derivative as the differece between
the full de Rham differential and the horizontal one:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ \delta
    & =
    j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ (\mathbf{d} - d)
    \\
    & =
    (d - d) \circ j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
    \\
    & =
    0
  \end{aligned}
$$

It remains to see the first statement:

Since the [[jet prolongation]] $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)$ preserves the spacetime coordinates $x^\mu$
(being a [[section]] of the [[jet bundle]]) it is immediate that the claimed relation
is satisfied on the
horizontal [[linear basis|basis]] 1-forms $\mathbf{d}x^\mu = d x^\mu$ (example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle}):

$$
  d j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast( \mathbf{d}x^\mu )
  =
  d^2 x^\mu = 0
  \phantom{AAAAA}
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast d \mathbf{d} x^\mu
  =
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast d^2 x^\mu
  \,.
$$

Therefore it finally remains only to check the first statement on smooth functions (0-forms).
So let

$$
  f
    =
  f\left(
    (x^\mu)
    \,,\,
    (\phi^a)
    \,,\,
    ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
    \,,\,
    \cdots
  \right)
$$

be a smooth function on the jet bundle. Then by the [[chain rule]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
    f\left(
      (x^\mu)
      \,,\,
      (\phi^a)
      \,,\,
      ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
    & =
    d
    f\left(
      (x^\mu)
      \,,\,
      (\Phi^a)
      \,,\,
      \left(  \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu} \right)
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \left(
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^a}
      \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^a_{,\nu}}
      \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^a}{\partial x^\nu \partial x^\mu}
      +
      \cdots
    \right)
    d x^\mu
  \end{aligned}
$$

That this is equal to $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast d f$ follows by the very definition
of the total spacetime derivative of $f$ (eq:SpacetimeTotalDerivativeOnSmoothFunctions).

## Lagrangians


Given any type of [[field (physics)|fields]] (def. \ref{Fields}), those field configurations that
are to be regarded as "physically realizable" (if we think of the field theory as a description of the [[observable universe]])
should satisfy some [[differential equation]] (the "[[equation of motion]]"), meaning that realizability of any field configuration may
be checked upon restricting the configuration to the [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] of each spacetime point.
This expresses the physical absence of "action at a distance" and is one aspect of what it means to have
a _[[local field theory]]_.

For many field theories of interest, their [[differential equation|differential]] [[equation of motion]]
is not a random [[partial differential equations]], but is of the special kind that exhibits the "[[principle of extremal action]]"
determined by a [[local Lagrangian density]]
(def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below). These are called _[[Lagrangian field theories]]_, and this is what we consider here.

Namely among all the variational differential forms (def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
two kinds stand out, namley the 0-forms in $\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)$ -- the smooth functions -- and the horizontal $p+1$-forms
$\Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E)$ -- to be called the _[[Lagrangian densities]] $\mathbf{L}$_ (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below) -- since these occupy the two "corners" of the [[variational bicomplex]] (eq:VariationalBicomplexDiagram).
There is not much to say about the 0-forms, but the [[Lagrangian densities]] $\mathbf{L}$ do inherit special structure
from their special position in the [[variational bicomplex]].

Their [[variational derivative]]
uniquely decomposes as 1) the _[[Euler-Lagrange derivative]]_ $\delta_{EL}\mathbf{EL}$ which is proportional to the variation of the fields
(instead of their derivatives) and 2) the [[total derivative|total spacetime derivative]] $d \Theta$
of a potential $\Theta$ for a _[[presymplectic current]]_ $\Omega \coloneqq \delta \Theta$
(prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below):

$$
  \delta \mathbf{L} = \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} + d \Theta
  \,.
$$

These two terms play a pivotal role in the theory: they induce the _[[covariant phase space]]_
of the [[field theory]]; this we discuss [below](#PhaseSpace). Before we get to that,
here we discuss the _symmetries_ of these terms, which will be important:

It turns out that every  [[infinitesimal symmetry of the Lagrangian density]] induces a
variational differential form called a _[[conserved current]]_ ([[Noether's theorem]], prop. \ref{NoethersFirstTheorem} below) and that
these conserved currents constitute an [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of the [[Lie algebra]]
of symmetries, called the [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra]] ("[[Dickey bracket]]").

In direct analogy, every infinitesimal symmetry of the [[presymplectic current]] is witnessed by
a variational form, called a _[[Hamiltonian differential form]]_ (def. \ref{HamiltonianForms} below).
The corresponding [[Lie n-algebra]] is the all-important _[[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|Poisson bracket Lie p+1-algebra]]_
of the Lagrangian field theory. In the simple special situation that we consider here, this is a
plain [[Lie algebra]] (prop. \ref{LocalPoissonBracket} below).

When we turn attention to the [[covariant phase space]] [below](#PhaseSpace)
the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]]
of the [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|Poisson bracket Lie p+1-algebra]] of [[Hamiltonian differential forms]]
yields the [[Poisson bracket Lie algebra]] on [[local observables]] on  [[covariant phase space]].
This is the all-important structure of the theory: the [[deformation quantization]] induced by this
bracket is the [[quantum physics|quantum]] aspect of the [[quantum field theory]].

Given a [[field bundle]] $E$ over a $(p+1)$-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\Sigma$ as in example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}, then a _[[local Lagrangian density]]_ $\mathbf{L}$ (for the type of field thus defined) is a [[horizontal differential form]] of degree $(p+1)$ (def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) on the corresponding [[jet bundle]]
(def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}):

$$
  \mathbf{L} \;\in \; \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma}(E)

By example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle}
in terms of the given [[volume form]] on spacetimes, any such Lagrangian density may uniquely be written as

$$
  \mathbf{L} = L \, dvol_\Sigma
$$

where the [[coefficient]] function (the _Lagrangian function_)
is a smooth function on the spacetime and field coordinates:

$$
  L = L((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots )
  \,.
$$

where by prop. \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold} $L((x^\mu), \cdots)$ depends locally on an arbitrary but finite
order of derivatives $\phi^a_{,\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}$.

We say that a [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ (def. \ref{Fields}) equipped with a [[local Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}$
is (or defines) a _[[prequantum field theory|prequantum]] [Lagrangian field theory]]_ on the [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$.

=--

(Over more general [[field bundles]] than we consider at the moment, the Lagrangian density may not exist
as a globally defined differential $(p+1)$-form, but as a [[circle n-bundle with connection|p-gerbe connection]].
This is the case for _[[locally variational field theories]]_ such as theories involving _[[higher WZW terms]]_.)

The subspace of the [[jet bundle]] on which the Euler-Lagrange differential vanishes is called the _[[shell]]_

$$
  \label{ShellInJetBundle}

Saying something holds  "on-shell" will mean that it holds after restriction to this
subspace.

The remaining term $d \Theta$ is unique, while $\Theta \in \Omega^{p,1}_{\Sigma}(E)$ is unique only up to terms $d \alpha$ in the image of $d$.
One possible choice is

The [[vertical derivative]] of a chosen $\Theta$ is called a _[[pre-symplectic current]]_ for $\mathbf{L}$:

$$
  \Omega \coloneqq \delta \Theta \;\;\; \in \Omega^{p,2}_{\Sigma}(E)

which, by the above, is unique up to addition of a total spacetime derivative $d \delta \alpha$.

Given a choice of $\Theta$ then the sum

$$

  \mathbf{L} + \Theta \;\in\; \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E) \oplus \Omega^{p,1}_\Sigma(E)

is called the corresponding _[[Lepage form]]_. Its de Rham derivative is the sum of
the Euler-Lagrange variation and the presymplectic current:

###### Proof

Using $\mathbf{L} = L dvol_\Sigma$ and that $d \mathbf{L} = 0$ by degree reasons (example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle}), we find

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{d}\mathbf{L}
    & =
    \left(
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a} \delta \phi^a
      +
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}} \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \mu_2}} \delta \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \mu_2}
      +
      \cdots
    \right)
    \wedge dvol_{\Sigma}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The idea now is to have $d \Theta$ pick up those terms that would appear as [[boundary]] terms under the [[integral]]
$\int_\Sigma j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \mathbf{d}L$ if we were to consider [[integration by parts]] to remove
spacetime derivatives of $\delta \phi^a$.

We compute, using example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle},
the total horizontal derivative of $\Theta$ from (eq:StandardThetaForTrivialVectorFieldBundleOnMinkowskiSpacetime) as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}

        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}} \delta d \phi^a
      \right)

        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\nu \mu}} \delta d \phi^a_{,\nu}

        +
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
      \right)

        \frac{d}{d x^\nu}
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu \nu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
      \right)
      + \cdots
    \right)
    \wedge dvol_\Sigma
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in the last line we used that

$$
  d x^{\mu_1} \wedge \iota_{\partial_{\mu_2}} dvol_\Sigma
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      dvol_\Sigma &\vert& \text{if}\, \mu_1 = \mu_2
      \\
      0 &\vert& \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
$$

Here the two terms proportional to $\frac{d}{d x^\nu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu \nu}} \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}$
cancel out, and we are left with

$$
  d \Theta
  \;=\;
    -
      \left(
        \frac{d}{d x^\mu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
        -
        \frac{d^2}{ d x^\mu d x^\nu}
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu \nu}}
        +
        \cdots
      \right)
      \delta \phi^a \wedge dvol_\Sigma
        -
      \left(
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
        +
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\nu \mu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\nu \mu}
        +
        \cdots
      \right)
      \wedge dvol_\Sigma
$$


Hence $-d \Theta$ shares with $\mathbf{d} \mathbf{L}$ the terms that are proportional to
$\delta \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}$ for $k \geq 1$,
and so the remaining terms are proportional to $\delta \phi^a$, as claimed:

$$
  \mathbf{d}L + d \Theta
  =
  \underset{
    = \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}
  }{
  \underbrace{
  \left(
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a}
    -
    \frac{d}{d x^\mu}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
    +
    \frac{d^2}{d x^\mu d x^\nu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu\nu}}
    +
    \cdots
  \right)
  \delta \phi^a \wedge dvol_\Sigma

  \Omega^{p,2}_{\Sigma}(E)
  \,,
$$

respectively.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that [[Euler-Lagrange operator]] $\delta_{EL} \colon \Omega^{p+1,0}(\Sigma) \to \Omega^{p+1,1}_S(\Sigma)$ takes the [[local Lagrangian density]] for the [[free field|free]] [[scalar field]] to

$$
  \delta_EL L
  \;=\;
  \left(
    \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu \nu}  + m^2 \phi
  \right)
  \delta \phi \wedge \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
  \,.
$$

First of all, the result of applying the [[variational derivative]] ([[vertical derivative]]) to the local Lagrangian density is

$$
  \delta L
    \;=\;
  \left(
    \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \delta \phi_{,\nu}
      +
    m^2 \phi \delta \phi
  \right)
  \wedge \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
  \,.
$$

By definition of the [[Euler-Lagrange operator]], in order to find $\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}$ and $\Theta$, we need to exhibit this as the
sum of the form $(-) \wedge \delta \phi  - d \Theta$.

The key to find $\Theta$ is  to realize $\delta \phi_{,\nu}\wedge \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma$ as a
[[total derivative|total spacetime derivative]] ([[horizontal derivative]]). Since $d \phi = \phi_{,\mu} d x^\mu$ this is accomplished by

$$
  \delta \phi_{,\nu} \wedge \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
  =
  \delta d \phi \wedge \iota_{\partial_\nu} \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
$$

Hence we may set

$$
  \Theta
    \coloneqq
  \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \delta \phi \wedge \iota_{\partial_\nu}
  \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
  \,,
$$

because with this we have

$$
  d \Theta
  =
  \eta^{\mu \nu}
  \left(
    \phi_{,\mu \nu} \delta \phi
    -
    \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \delta \phi_{,\nu}
  \right) \wedge \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
  \,.
$$

In conclusion this yields the decomposition of the vertical differential of the Lagrangian density

$$
  \delta L
  =
  \underset{
    = \delta_{EL} \mathcal{L}
  }{
  \underbrace{
    \left(
      \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu \nu}  + m^2 \phi
    \right)
    \delta \phi \wedge \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma
  }
  }
  -
  d \Theta
  \,,
$$

which shows that $\delta_{EL} L$ is as claimed, and that $\Theta$ is a presymplectic potential current.
Hence the presymplectic current itself is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Omega &\coloneqq \delta \Theta
    \\
    & =
    \delta \left( \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \delta \phi \wedge \iota_{\partial_\nu} \mathrm{dvol}_\Sigma \right)

By [[Cartan's homotopy formula]] for the [[Lie derivative]] and using (eq:dLDecomposition)

we may re-express the defining equation for the symmetry as

$$

which is equivalent to

$$
  d(\underset{= J_v}{\underbrace{\tilde J - \iota_v \Theta}}) = \frac{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}}{\delta v}

Since by definition of $\mathcal{E}$ the form $\frac{\delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}}{\delta v}$ vanishes on $\mathcal{E}$
this yields the claim.

Since therefore both the [[conserved currents]] from [[Noether's theorem]] as well as
the [[Hamiltonian differential forms]] are generators of infinitesimal [[symmetries]] of certain variational forms

For the Hamiltonian forms it is the _[[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|Poisson bracket Lie p+1-algebra]]_. Since here for simplicity
we are considering just vertical variations, we have just a plain [[Lie algebra]].

it does indeed land in $\Omega^{p,0}_{\Sigma,Ham}(E)$, hence that the following
equation holds:

$$
  \delta \iota_{v_2} \iota_{v_1} \Omega
  \;=\;
  \iota_{[v_1, v_2]} \Omega
  \,.
$$

To see this we use [[Cartan calculus]]:

Since the variation $v$ is purely vertical, by definition, contraction with $v$ anti-commutes with
the total horizontal derivative:

$$
  d \circ \iota_{v} + \iota_v \circ d = 0
  \,.
$$

This makes [[Cartan's homotopy formula]] for the [[Lie derivative]]

$$
  \mathcal{L}_v = \mathbf{d} \circ \iota_v + \iota_v \circ \mathbf{d}
$$

have an analogue with the full de Rham differential replaced by the [[variational derivative]] ([[vertical derivative]])
$\delta = \mathbf{d} - d$:

$$
  \mathcal{L}_v = \delta \circ \iota_v + \iota_v \circ \delta
  \,.
$$


With this we compute as follows:


$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta \iota_{v_1} \iota_{v_2} \Omega
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2} \delta \iota_{v_1} \iota_{v_2} \Omega
    -
    \tfrac{1}{2} (v_1 \leftrightarrow v_2)
    \\
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    \left(
      \mathcal{L}_{v_1} \iota_{v_2} \Omega
      -
      \iota_{v_1} \delta \iota_{v_2} \Omega
    \right)
    -
    \tfrac{1}{2} (v_1 \leftrightarrow v_2)
    \\
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    \left(
      \mathcal{L}_{v_1} \iota_{v_2} \Omega
      -
      \iota_{v_1} \mathcal{L}_{v_2} \Omega
      +
      \iota_{v_1} \iota_{v_2} \underset{= 0}{\underbrace{\delta \Omega}}
    \right)
    -
    \tfrac{1}{2} (v_1 \leftrightarrow v_2)
    \\
    & =
    [\mathcal{L}_{v_2}, \iota_{v_1}] \Omega
    \\
    & =
    \iota_{[v_1, v_2]} \Omega
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

This shows that the bracket is well defined.

It remains to see that the bracket satifies the [[Jacobi identity]]:

$$
\left\{ (H_1, v_1), \left\{ (H_2, v_2), (H_3,v_3) \right\} \right\}
  \;+\; (cyclic)
   \;=\;
  0
$$

hence that

$$
  \left(  \iota_{v_1} \iota_{[v_2,v_3]}  \Omega ,\,   [v_1, [v_2, v_2]] \right)
  \;+\; (cyclic)
  \;=\; 0
  \,.
$$

Here $ [v_1, [v_2, v_3]] + (cyclic) = 0 $ is the ordinary Jacobi identity for [[vector fields]],
and hence what needs to be shown is that

$$
  \iota_{v_1} \iota_{[v_2, v_3]}   \Omega + (cyclic) = 0
$$

We check this by repeated uses of [[Cartan calculus]], using in addition
that

1. $\delta \iota_{v_i} \Omega = 0$

   (since $\iota_{v_i} \Omega = \delta H_i$ by $v_i$ being Hamiltonian)

1. $\mathcal{L}_{v_i} \Omega = 0$

   (since in addition $\delta \Omega = 0$)

1. $\iota_{v_1} \iota_{v_2} \iota_{v_3} \Omega = 0$

   (since $\Omega \in \Omega^{p,2}_\Sigma(E)$ is of vertical degree 2, and since all variations $v_i$ are vertical by assumption).

So we compute as follows (a special case of [FRS 13b, lemma 3.1.1](#Poisson+bracket+Lie+n-algebra#FRS13b)):

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    0
    & =

###### Lemma

The horizontally exact Hamiltonian forms constitute a [[Lie ideal]] for the
local Poisson Lie bracket (eq:LocalPoissonLieBracket).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $E$ be a horizontally exact Hamiltonian form, hence

$$
  E = d K
$$

for some $K$. Write $e$ for a [[Hamiltonian vector field]] for $E$.

Then for $(H,v)$ any other pair consisting of a Hamiltonian form and a corresponding
Hamiltonian vector field, we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \iota_v \iota_e \Omega
    & =
    \iota_v \delta E
    \\
    & =
    \iota_v \delta d K
    \\
    & =
    - \iota_v d \delta K
    \\
    & =
    d \iota_v \delta K
  \end{aligned}
$$

where we used that the horizontal derivative anti-commutes with the
vertical one by construction of the [[variational bicomplex]], and
 that $\iota_e$ anti-commutes with the horizontal derivative $d$ since the variation $e$ (def. \ref{Variation}) is
by definition vertical.

Consider the [[Lagrangian field theory]] for the [[free field|free]] [[real scalar field]] from example \ref{LagrangianForFreeScalarFieldOnMinkowskiSpacetime}.

By example \ref{FreeScalarFieldEOM} is [[presymplectic current]] is

$$
  \Omega
   =
  \eta^{\mu \nu} \delta \phi_{,\mu} \wedge \delta \phi \wedge \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma

The corresponding [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|Poisson bracket Lie (p+1)-algebra]] (prop. \ref{LocalPoissonBracket}) has in degree 0
[[Hamiltonian forms]] (def. \ref{HamiltonianDifferentialForms}) such as

$$
  Q \coloneqq \phi \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma \in \Omega^{p,0}(E)

and

$$
  P \coloneqq \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \iota_{\partial_\nu} dvol_{\Sigma} \in \Omega^{p,0}(E)

The corresponding [[Hamiltonian vector fields]] are

$$
 v_P = \partial_{\phi_{,0}}

and

$$
  v_Q = - \partial_{\phi}

$$
  \{ b_1 Q, b_2 P \} = \pm b_1 b_2 \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma

###### Definition
**([[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra|Heisenberg Lie p+1-algebra]])

Given a [[Lagrangian field theory]] whose [[field bundle]] is a [[trivial vector bundle]]
as in example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}, its [[jet bundle]] inherits the structure of a
trivial vector bundle (this is the only case we have been making explicit here anyway, def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}). Hence addition in the [[fibers]]
gives it the structure of a [[group]], by translation.

If the [[presymplectic current]] is [[left invariant differential form|left invariant]] with respect to this
group structure, then it makes sense to ask for that sub [[Lie n-algebra|Lie p+1-algebra]]
of the [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|Poisson bracket Lie (p+1)-algebra]] which covers these
translations. This is the corresponding _[[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra|Heisenberg Lie (p+1)-algebra]]_.

generated by the [[linear functionals]].

$\,$


## Observables


Given a [[field theory]] as above, then an _[[observable]]_ is a [[smooth function]]

$$
  A \;\colon\; \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{\delta_{EL} = 0} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

on the space of [[on-shell]]
field [[trajectories]] (def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}). We think
of this function as assigning to each physically realizable field history $\Phi$ the value $A(\Phi)$ of the given quantity as exhibited by
that field history. For instance concepts like "avarage field amplitude in spacetime region $\mathcal{O}$" should be
observables.

In _[[local field theory]]_ the idea is that both the [[equations of motion]] as well as the observations
are fully determined by their restriction to [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] of spacetime points ([[events]]).
For the equations of motion this means that they are [[partial differential equations]] as we have seen
[above](#EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime). For the observables
it should mean that they must be functions of the value of the Field histories and their derivatives
_at any point_ of spacetime, or rather averages of such local observations over regions of spacetime.
Now a "smooth function of the value of the field field histories and their derivatives at any point"
is precisely a smooth function on the [[jet bundle]] of the [[field bundle]] (example \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
pulled back via [[jet prolongation]] (def. \ref{JetProlongation})
and if this is to be averaged over spacetime it needs to be the coefficient of a horizontal $p+1$-form (prop. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}).

In mathematical terminology these desiderata say that the [[local observables]] in a local field theory should be precisely the
"[[transgression of variational differential forms|transgressions]]" of horizontal variational $p+1$-forms
(with compact spacetime support, def. \ref{SpacetimeSupport} below) to the [[space of field histories]]. This is
def. \ref{TransgressionOfVariationalDifferentialFormsToConfigrationSpaces} below.

A key example of a [[local observable]] in [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) is the _[[action functional]]_ (example \ref{ActionFunctional} below). This is the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]]
of the [[Lagrangian density]] itself, or rather of its product with an "[[adiabatic switching]] function" that
localizes its [[support]] in a compact spacetime region. In typical cases the physical quantity whose observation is
represented by the action functional is the difference of the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] energy-momentum minus the [[potential energy]]
of a field history averaged over the given region of spacetime.

The [[equations of motion]] of a [[Lagrangian field theory]] say that those field histories
are physically realized which are [[critical points]] of this [[action functional]] observable. This is
the _[[principle of extremal action]]_ (prop. \ref{PrincipleOfExtremalAction} below).

This formalizes what it means for a [[field (physics)|field]] history $\Phi$ to be "realizable" (physically admissible)
(a solution to the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]], def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
and what the ([[local observable|local]]) [[observable]] quantities on field histories are (def. \ref{LocalObservables}).
It remains to formalize what it means for the [[physical system]] to be in some definite _[[state]]_
so that the [[observable]] quantities take some definite value, reflecting the properties of that state.

Whatever formalization for _[[states]]_ of a [[field theory]] one considers, at the very least
the [[space of states]] $States$ should come with a pairing [[linear map]]

$$
  \array{
    Obs \otimes States & \longrightarrow&  \mathcal{C}
    \\
    \left( A , \langle - \rangle \right) &\mapsto& \langle A \rangle
  }
$$

which reads in an [[observable]] quantity $A$ and a state, to be denoted $\langle - \rangle$,
and produces the [[complex number]] $\langle A \rangle$
which is the "value of the observable quantity $A$ in the case that the physical system is in the state $\langle -\rangle$".

One might imagine that
it is fundamentally possible to pinpoint the exact [[field (physics)|field]] history that the
[[physical system]] is found in. From this perspective fixing a [[state]] should simply mean to
pick an element in the [[on-shell]] [[space of field histories]] $\Phi \in \Gamma_{\Sigma}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0}$.
If we write $\langle -\rangle_{\Phi}$ for this state, its pairing map with the states would simply be
[[evaluation]] of the observable, being a function on the field history space, on that particular element in this space:

$$
  \langle A \rangle_{\Phi} \coloneqq A(\Phi)
  \,.
$$

However, in the practice of [[experiment]] a field history can never be known precisely, without remaining uncertainty.
Moreover, [[quantum physics]] (to which we finally come [below](#QuantumObservables)), suggests that this is
true even in principle. Therefore we should allow [[states]] to be a kind of [[probability distributions]]
on the [[space of field histories]], and regard the pairing $\langle A \rangle$ of a state $\langle - \rangle$ with an observable
$A$ as a kind of _[[expectation value]]_ of the function $A$ averaged with respect to this probability distribution.
Specifically if the observable quantity $A$ is (a smooth approximation to) a [[characteristic function]]
of a [[subset]] $S \subset \Gamma_{\Sigma}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0}$ of the [[space of field histories]], then its value in a given state should be the [[probability]] to find the [[physical system]] in that that subset of field histories.

But, moreover, the [[superposition principle]] of [[quantum physics]] says that the actually observable observables
are only those of the form $A^\ast A$ (for $A^\ast$ the image under the star-operation on the [[star algebra]]
of observables.

This finally leads to the definition of _[[states]]_ in def. \ref{States} below.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement, consider a horizontally exact variational form

$$
  d \alpha \in \Omega^{r,s}_{\Sigma,cp}(E)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{PullbackAlongJetProlongationIntertwinesHorizontalDerivative} the pullback of this form
along the jet prolongation of fields is exact in the $\Sigma$-direction:

$$
  (j^\infty_\Sigma\Phi_{(-)})^\ast(d \alpha )
  \;=\;
  d_\Sigma (j^\infty_\Sigma\Phi_{(-)})^\ast \alpha
  \,,
$$

(where we write $d = d_U + d_\Sigma$ for the de Rham differential on $U \times \Sigma$).
Hence the integral of this over $\Sigma$, and hence the transgression form, vanishes
by [[Stokes' theorem]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tau_{\Sigma}(d \alpha)
    & =
    \int_\Sigma
      d_\Sigma (j^\infty_\Sigma\Phi_{(-)})^\ast\alpha
    \\
    & = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$


Regarding the second statement: by the [[Leibniz rule]] for de Rham differential
([[product law]] of [[differentiation]]) it is sufficient to check the claim on variational
derivatives of local coordinate functions

$$
  \delta \phi^a_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} b
  \in
  \Omega^{0,1}_\Sigma(E)
  \,.
$$

The [[pullback of differential forms]]
along $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi_{(-)}) \colon U \times \Sigma \to J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ has two contributions:
one from the variation along $\Sigma$, the other from variation along $U$:


1. By prop. \ref{PullbackAlongJetProlongationIntertwinesHorizontalDerivative},
for _fixed_ $u \in U$ the pullback of $\delta \phi^a_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}$ along the jet prolongation vanishes.

1. For  fixed $x \in \Sigma$, the pullback of the full de Rham differential $\mathbf{d} \phi^a_{\mu_1\cdots \mu_k}$ is

   $$
     \begin{aligned}

   (since the full de Rham differentials always commute with pullback of differential forms),
   while the pullback of the horizontal derivative
$d \phi^a_{\mu_1\cdots \mu_k} = \phi^a_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_{k} \mu_{k+1}} \mathbf{d}x^{\mu_{k+1}}$

This implies over the given smooth family $\Phi_{(-)}$ that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tau_\Sigma\left(

then the corresponding _[[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equation of motion]]_
on fields $\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ is the equation

$$

where $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi) \colon \Sigma \to J^\infty_{\Sigma}(E)$ denotes the [[jet prolongation]] of $\Phi$ (def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}), $j^\infty_{\Sigma}(\Phi)^\ast$ the operation of
[[pullback

In the case that the field bundle is a trivial vector bundle over Minowski spacetime as in example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}
this equation is
equivalently the following [[differential equation]] (again using prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}):

precisely if $\Phi$ solves the [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]]

(Suppose $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast (  \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} )$ did not vanish at some $x \in \Sigma$,

$$

This is a [[star-algebra]] under [[complex conjugation]].

(That we consider functions with values in [[complex numbers]] instead of [[real numbers]] is a

A typical example of [[local observables]] (def. \ref{LocalObservables}) for the [[scalar field]] (example \ref{RealScalarFieldBundle}) is
the "field amplitude averaged over a given spacetime region"
determined by a [[bump function]] $b \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)$. On an on-shell  field configuration $\Phi$ this observable
takes as value the integral $\int_\Sigma \Phi(x) b(x) dvol_\Sigma(x)$. Similar observables are obtained from integrals such as
$\int_\Sigma \Phi(x) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x^\mu}(x) b(x) dvol_\Sigma(x)$ etc.
These are examples of _[[local observables]]_, in that they are spacetime averages of quantities that depend
on functions of the field histories and their derivatives _at a fixed spacetime point_.

Since the [[equation of motion]] is the [[Klein-Gordon equation]] $(\Box + m^2) \Phi = 0$

[[presymplectic smooth spaces]]. The following proposition says that this is the case.
Therefore one speaks of the _[[covariant phase space]]_ of a [[Lagrangian field theory]]:

###### Proposition
**([[covariant phase space]])**

Consider $(E, \mathbf{L})$ a [[Lagrangian field theory]] on a [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}).

Let

$$
  \Sigma_{tra} \overset{tra}{\hookrightarrow} \Sigma
$$

be a [[submanifold]] [[manifold with boundary|with two boundary components]]
$\partial \Sigma_{tra} = \Sigma_{in} \sqcup \Sigma_{out}$ ,
both of which are [[Cauchy surfaces]] (def. \ref{CauchySurface}).

Then the corresponding inclusion diagram

$$
  \array{
    && \Sigma_{tra}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{in}}\nearrow && \nwarrow^{\mathrm{out}}
    \\
    \Sigma_{in}
    && &&
    \Sigma_{out}
  }
$$

induces a [[Lagrangian correspondence]] between the associated [[phase spaces]] (def. \ref{PhaseSpaceAssociatedWithCauchySurface})

$$
  \array{
    && \Gamma_{\Sigma_{tra}}(E)_{\delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} = 0}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{ (-)\vert_{in} }}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{ (-)\vert_{out} }}
    \\
    \Gamma_{\Sigma^{(in)}}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}= 0}
    && &&
    \Gamma_{\Sigma^{(out)}}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}= 0}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\omega_{in}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\omega_{out}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{\Omega}^{2}
  }
$$

in that the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] of the
two [[presymplectic forms]] (eq:TransgressionOfPresymplecticCurrentToCauchySurface) coincides on the
space of field histories:

$$
  \left( (-)\vert_{in}\right)^\ast\left( \omega_{in}\right)

  \in
  \Omega^2
  \left(
    \Gamma_{\Sigma_{tra}}(E)_{\delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} = 0}
  \right)

$$

Hence there is a well defined [[presymplectic form]]

$$
  \omega \in \Omega^2\left(  \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}} = 0 \right)
$$

on the genuine [[space of field histories]], given by $\omega \coloneqq i^\ast \omega_{\Sigma_p}$
for any Cauchy surface $\Sigma_p \overset{i}{\hookrightarrow} \Sigma$. This [[presymplectic smooth space]]

$$
  \left(
    \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}}
    \,,\,
    \omega
  \right)
$$

is therefore called the _[[covariant phase space]]_ of the [[Lagrangian field theory]] $(E,\mathbf{L})$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the [[Lepage form]] (eq:TheLepage)

$$
  \mathbf{L} + \Theta
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}_\Sigma(E)
  \,.
$$

and recall (eq:DerivativeOfLepageForm) that its de Rham differetial is the
sum of the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]] of the Lagrangian density and the [[presymplectic current]]:

$$
  \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{L} + \Theta)
  \;=\;
  \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} + \Omega
  \,.
$$

In particular this means that $\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} + \Omega$ is closed, so that the
relative transgresson formula (prop. \ref{RelativeTransgressionOfDifferentialForms}) does apply.

Notice also that the following transgressions vanish:

1. $\tau_{\Sigma}\left( \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}  \right) \in \Gamma_{\Sigma}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0}$;

1. $\tau_{\Sigma}\left(  \Omega \right) = 0$;

1. $\tau_{\Sigma_p}\left( \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}  \right) = 0$.

The first item is the very definition of the
[[on-shell]] fields (def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
and the second and third expressions vanish by degree reasons
(remark \ref{TransgressionToDimensionrSupportedOnHorizontalrForms}).


With this the statement follows from the formula for relative [[transgression of variational differential forms]] (prop. \ref{RelativeTransgressionOfDifferentialForms}):

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d
    \underset{= 0}{

###### Definition
**([[Poisson bracket]] on Hamiltoniann [[local observables]] on  [[covariant phase space]])**

The _[[Poisson bracket]]_ on Hamiltonian local observables (def. \ref{HamiltonianLocalObservables})
is the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]] (def. \ref{TransgressionOfVariationalDifferentialFormsToConfigrationSpaces})
of the [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|Poisson bracket Lie (p+1)-algebra]] (def. \ref{LocalPoissonBracket})
of the corresponding [[Hamiltonian differential forms]] (def. \ref{LocalPoissonBracket})
to the [[covariant phase space]] (def. \ref{CovariantPhaseSpace}).

Explicitly: for $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ a choice of [[Cauchy surface]] (def. \ref{CauchySurface})
then the Poisson bracket between two local Hamiltonian observables
$\tau_{\Sigma_p}((H_i, v_i))$ is

$$
  \label{PoissonBracketTransgressedToCauchySurface}
  \left\{
    \tau_{\Sigma_p}((H_1, v_1))
    \,,\,
    \tau_{\Sigma_p}( (H_2, v_2) )
  \right\}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \tau_{\Sigma_p}( \{ (H_1, v_1), (H_2, v_2) \} )
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the transgression of the Poisson bracket of Hamiltonian forms
on the jet bundle.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

We need to see that equation (eq:PoissonBracketTransgressedToCauchySurface) is well defined,
in that it does not depend on the choice of Hamiltonian form $(H_i, v_i)$
representing the local Hamiltonian observable $\tau_{\Sigma_p}(H_i)$.

It is clear that all the transgressions involved depend only on the restriction
of the Hamiltonian forms to the pullback of the jet bundle to $N_\Sigma \Sigma_p$.
Moreover the Poisson bracket on the jet bundle (eq:LocalPoissonLieBracket)
respects this restriction.

Now after this restriction, a Hamiltonian form is in the [[kernel]] of the transgression
relative to $\Sigma_p$ precisely if it is horizontally exact. Therefore the claim
follows with the statement that horizontally exact forms constitute a
Lie ideal for the Poisson bracket on the jet bundle (lemma \ref{HorizontallyExactFormsDropOutOfLocalLieBracket}).

###### Example
**([[Poisson bracket]] of the  [[real scalar field]] -- the [[Peierls bracket]])

Consider the [[Lagrangian field theory]] of the [[free field|free]] [[scalar field]] 
(example \ref{LagrangianForFreeScalarFieldOnMinkowskiSpacetime}),
and consider the [[Cauchy surface]] defined by $x^0 = 0$.

By example \ref{LocalPoissonBracketForRealScalarField} the local Poisson bracket 
of the [[Hamiltonian forms]] 

$$
  Q \coloneqq \phi \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma \in \Omega^{p,0}(E)
$$

and

$$
  P \coloneqq \eta^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \iota_{\partial_\nu} dvol_{\Sigma} \in \Omega^{p,0}(E)
  \,.
$$

is 

$$
  \{Q,P\} = \iota_{v_Q} \iota_{v_P} \omega = \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma
  \,.
$$


Upon [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]] according to def. \ref{PoissonBracketOnHamiltonianLocalObservables}
 this yields the following [[Poisson bracket]] 

$$
  \left\{
    \int_{\Sigma_p} b_1(\vec x) \phi(t,\vec x) \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma(x)
    d^p \vec x
    \;,\;
    \int_{\Sigma_p} b_2(\vec x) \partial_0 \phi(t,\vec x) \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma(\vec x)
  \right\}
  \;=\;
  \int_{\Sigma_p} b_1(\vec x) b_2(\vec x) \iota_{\partial_0} dvol_\Sigma(\vec x)
  d^p \vec x
  \,.
$$

where

$$
  \phi(x), \partial_0 \phi(x) : PhaseSpace(\Sigma_p^t) \to \mathbb{R}
$$

denote the point-evaluation functions ([[functionals]]), which act on a field configuration $\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E) = C^\infty(\Sigma)$ as

$$
 \phi(x)(\Phi) \coloneqq \Phi(x)
 \phantom{AAAAAAAA}
 \partial_0 \phi(x) (\Phi) \coloneqq \partial_0 \Phi(x)
 \,.
$$

Notice that these point-evaluation functions themselves do not arise
as the transgression of elements in $\Omega^{p,0}(E)$, only their smearings such as $\int_{\Sigma_p} b_1 \phi dvol_{\Sigma_p}$ do.
Nevertheless we may express the above Poisson bracket conveniently via the [[integral kernel]]

$$
  \label{PoissonBracketOfScalarFieldPointEvaluationOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
  \{\phi(t,\vec x), \phi(t,\vec y) \}
  =
  \delta(\vec x - \vec y)
  \,.
$$

This integral kernel is the _[[causal propagator]]_

$$
  \Delta
    \;\in\;
  \mathcal{D}'(\Sigma \times \Sigma)
$$

(also known as the _[[Pauli-Jordan distribution]]_ or _[[Peierls bracket]]_)
on Minkowski spacetime:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \{ \phi(x), \phi(y) \}
    & =
    \Delta(x,y)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    -i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \tfrac{1}{2 E(\vec k)}\left(
    e^{- i E(\vec k) (x-y)^0 - \vec k \cdot (\vec x - \vec y)}
    -
    e^{+ i E(\vec k) (x-y)^0 + \vec k \cdot (\vec x - \vec y)}
  \right) d^p \vec k
    \\
    & =
   -i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \delta( k_\mu k^\mu + m^2 ) sgn( k_0 ) e^{ - i k_\mu (x-y)^\mu } d^{p+1} k
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$


=---

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By [[Fourier transform]] the general solution to the [[Klein-Gordon equation]] (example \ref{EquationOfMotionOfFreeRealScalarField}) may be expressed in the form

$$
  \Phi(x)
    \;=\;
  (2\pi)^{-p} \int  Amp(k) e^{- i k_\mu x^\mu } \delta( k_\mu k^\mu + m^2 ) d^{p+1} k
  \,,
$$

where $Amp(k) \in \mathbb{C}$ is the _complex amplitude_ of the $k$th mode $(k \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1})$.

We may split this into the contributions with positive and those with negative [[energy]] $k_0$
by decomposing the integral over $k_0$ as

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Phi(x)
    & = \phantom{+}
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int_0^\infty  \int Amp(k_0, \vec k) e^{- i k_0 x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} \delta(- k_0^2 + \vec k + m^2) d^p \vec k \, d k_0
    \\
    & \phantom{=} +
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int_0^\infty  \int Amp(-k_0, \vec k) e^{+ i k_0 x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} \delta(-k_0^2 + \vec k^2 + m^2) d^p \vec k \, d k_0
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

By [[changing integration variables]] via $k_0 = +\sqrt{ h }$ this yields

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Phi(x)
    & = \phantom{+}
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int_0^\infty  \int Amp(\sqrt{h}, \vec k) e^{- i \sqrt{h} x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} \delta(- h + \vec k + m^2) d^p \vec k \, \frac{d h}{2\sqrt{h}}
    \\
    & \phantom{=} +
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int_0^\infty  \int Amp(- \sqrt{h}, \vec k) e^{+ i \sqrt{h} x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} \delta(- h + \vec k^2 + m^2) d^p \vec k \, \frac{d h}{2 \sqrt{h}}
    \\
    & = \phantom{+}
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int Amp(E(\vec k), \vec k) e^{- i E(\vec k) x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} d^p \vec k
    \\
    & \phantom{=} +
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int Amp(-E(\vec k), \vec k) e^{+ i E(\vec k) x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} d^p \vec k
  \end{aligned}
$$

where we defined the _on-shell [[energy]]_

$$
  E(\vec k) \coloneqq + \sqrt{ \vec k^2 + m^2 }
  \,.
$$

It is convenient to also change variables $\vec k \mapsto - \vec k$ in the second integral. This yields

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Phi(x)
    &= \phantom{+}
      (2\pi)^{-p/2}
      \int Amp(E(\vec k), \vec k) e^{- i E(\vec k) x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x} d^p \vec k
      \\
      & \phantom{=} +
      (-1)^p
      (2\pi)^{-p/2}
      \int Amp(-E(\vec k), \vec k) e^{+ i E(\vec k) x^0 + i \vec k \cdot \vec x} d^p \vec k
  \end{aligned}
    \,.
$$

Since $\Phi$ is real-valued, it follows that under [[complex conjugation]] $(-)^\ast$
the amplitudes are related by

$$
  Amp(E(\vec k), \vec k)^\ast = (-1)^p Amp(-E(\vec k), \vec k)
  \,.
$$

We abbreviate (cf. [Scharf 01 (1.1.18)](#Scharf01))

$$
  A(\vec k) \coloneqq E(\vec k) Amp(E(\vec k), \vec k)
  \,,
$$

where the prefactor just serves to make some of the following formulas come out conveniently.

With this the general solution to the Klein-Gordon equation is finally of the form

$$
  \label{FourierModeExpansionOfScalarFieldOnminkowskiSpacetime}
  \Phi(x)
  =
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 E(\vec k)}}
      \left(
        A(\vec k) e^{- i E(\vec k) x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x}
        +
        A(\vec k)^\ast e^{+ i E(\vec k) x^0 + i \vec k \cdot \vec x}
      \right)
    d^p \vec k
    \,.
$$

and hence its time derivative is

$$
  \partial_0 \Phi(x)
  =
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int -i \sqrt{E(k)/2}
      \left(
        A(\vec k) e^{- i E(\vec k) x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x}
        -
        A(\vec k)^\ast e^{+ i E(\vec k) x^0 + i \vec k \cdot \vec x}
      \right)
    d^p \vec k
    \,.
$$

This allows to express the modes in terms of the value of the field and its time derivative at $t = 0$:

$$
  A(\vec k)
  =
   (2 \pi)^{-p/2}
   \int
     \left( \sqrt{E(k)/2}\Phi(0,\vec x) + i \frac{1}{2\sqrt{E(k)}} \partial_0 \Phi(0,\vec x)\right) \exp( i \vec k \cdot \vec x )
   d^p \vec x
   \,.
$$

As in example \ref{PoissonBracketsOverMinkowskiSpacetime} we denote the corresponding evaluation functional

$$
  a(\vec k) \;\colon\; C^\infty(\Sigma) \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

by the corresponding lower case symbol:

$$
  a(\vec k)
   \;\coloneqq\;
   (2 \pi)^{-p/2}
   \int
     \left( \sqrt{E(k)/2}\phi(\vec x) + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 E(k)}} \partial_0 \phi(\vec x)\right) \exp( i \vec k \cdot \vec x )
   d^p \vec x
   \,.
$$

With the Poisson bracket kernel $\{\phi(\vec x), \phi(\vec y)\} = \delta(\vec x - \vec y)$ from example \ref{PoissonBracketsOverMinkowskiSpacetime} (eq:PoissonBracketOfScalarFieldPointEvaluationOnMinkowskiSpacetime),
it follow that the  (integral kernel for the) Poisson bracket of these mode functionals is
that of the [[canonical commutation relations]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \label{CanonicalPoissonCommutationOfModesOfFreeScalarFieldOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
    \{ a(\vec k_1), a(\vec k_2)^\ast  \}
    & =
    -i
    (2\pi)^{-p}
    \int \delta(\vec x_1 - \vec x_2) e^{i  ( \vec k_1 \cdot \vec x_1 - \vec k_2 \cdot \vec x_2) } d \vec x_1 d\vec x_2
    \\
    & =
    -i
    (2\pi)^{-p}
    \int e^{i (\vec k_1 - \vec k_2) \cdot \vec x } d \vec x
    & =
    \\
    & =  -i \delta(\vec k_1 - \vec k_2)
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in the last step we used the [[Fourier transform]] representation of the [[delta distribution]] ([this prop.](Dirac+distribution#FourierTransform)).

In order to finally compute $\{\phi(x), \phi(y)\}$, it is convenient to break this up into two contributions:
Write

$$
  \phi^{(+)}(x)
  \;\coloneqq\;
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 E(\vec k)}}
        a(\vec k)^\ast e^{+ i E(\vec k) x^0 + i \vec k \cdot \vec x}
    d^p \vec k
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \phi^{(-)}(x)
  \;\coloneqq\;
    (2\pi)^{-p/2}
    \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 E(\vec k)}}
        a(\vec k) e^{- i E(\vec k) x^0 - i \vec k \cdot \vec x}
    d^p \vec k
$$

for the positive and negative energy contributions from the Fourier expansion in (eq:FourierModeExpansionOfScalarFieldOnminkowskiSpacetime), so that

$$
  \phi(x) = \phi^{(-)}(x)  + \phi^{(+)}(x)
  \,.
$$

Using the [[canonical commutation relation]] of the mode functions (eq:CanonicalPoissonCommutationOfModesOfFreeScalarFieldOnMinkowskiSpacetime), we find

$$
  \label{2PointFunctionFreeScalarFieldOnMinkowski}
  \begin{aligned}
    -i \omega(x,y)
     & \coloneqq
     \{ \phi^{(-)}(x), \phi^{(+)}(y) \}
    \\
    &=
    -i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \tfrac{1}{2 E(\vec k)} e^{- i E(\vec k) (x-y)^0 - \vec k \cdot (\vec x - \vec y)} d^{p} \vec k
    \\
    & =
    -i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \delta( k_\mu k^\mu + m^2 ) \Theta( k_0 ) e^{ - i k_\mu (x-y)^\mu } d^{p+1} k
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in the last line we again applied [[change of integration variables]].
This $\omega$ is known as the _[[2-point function]]_ or _[[Hadamard propagator]]_ on Minkowski spacetime.
Similarly

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \{ \phi^{(+)}(x), \phi^{(-)}(y) \}
  & =
  + i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \tfrac{1}{2 E(\vec k)} e^{i E(\vec k) (x-y)^0 + \vec k \cdot (\vec x - \vec y)} d^{p} \vec k
  \\
  & =
  + i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \delta( k_\mu k^\mu + m^2 ) \Theta( -k_0 ) e^{ - i k_\mu (x-y)^\mu } d^{p+1} k
  \\
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

In particular this says that

$$
  \{ \phi^{(+)}(x), \phi^{(-)}(y) \}
  =
  - \omega(y,x)
  \coloneqq
  -
  \{ \phi^{(-)}(y), \phi^{(+)}(x) \}
  \,.
$$


With this we finally obtain the expression for the [[causal propagator]] as the skew-symmetrization
of the [[2-point function]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \{
    \phi(x),
    \phi(y)
  \}
  & =
  \{ \phi^{(-)}(x), \phi^{(+)}(y) \}
  +
  \{\phi^{(+)}(x), \phi^{(-)}(y)\}
  \\
  & =
  \omega(x,y) - \omega(y,x)
  \\
  & =
  -i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \tfrac{1}{2 E(\vec k)}\left(
    e^{- i E(\vec k) (x-y)^0 - \vec k \cdot (\vec x - \vec y)}
    -
    e^{+ i E(\vec k) (x-y)^0 + \vec k \cdot (\vec x - \vec y)}
  \right) d^p \vec k
  \\
  & =
  -i (2\pi)^{-p} \int \delta( k_\mu k^\mu + m^2 ) sgn( k_0 ) e^{ - i k_\mu (x-y)^\mu } d^{p+1} k
 \,.
  \end{aligned}
