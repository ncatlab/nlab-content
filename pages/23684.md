## Definition ##

A morphism $f \in Hom_A(a,b)$ of a [[dagger 2-poset]] $A$ is a **monic map** if it is an [[injective morphism in a dagger 2-poset|injective]] [[map in a dagger 2-poset|map]]. 

The type of all monic maps in $Hom_A(a,b)$ is defined as 

$$MonoMap(a, b) \coloneqq \sum_{f:Hom_A(a,b)} isInjective(f) \times isMap(f)$$
