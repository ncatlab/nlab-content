## Idea

The __specialisation order__ is a way of turning any [[topological space]] $X$ into a [[preorder]]ed set (with the same underlying set).

###### Definition 
Given a topological space $X$ with topology $\mathcal{O}(X)$, the specialization order $\leq$ is defined by either of the following two equivalent conditions: 

1. $x \leq y$ if and only if $x$ belongs to the [[topological closure]] of $\{y\}$; we say that $x$ is a __specialisation__ of $y$. 

1. $x \leq y$ if and only if $\forall_{U \colon \mathcal{O}(X)} (x \in U) \Rightarrow (y \in U).$

(Note: some authors use the opposite ordering convention.)

## Properties

$X$ is $T_0$ if and only if its specialisation order is a [[partial order]].  $X$ is $T_1$ iff its specialisation order is [[equality]].  $X$ is $R_1$ (like $T_1$ but without $T_0$) iff its specialisation order is an [[equivalence relation]].  (See [[separation axioms]].)

Given a [[continuous map]] $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces, it is order-preserving relative to the specialisation order.  Thus, we have a [[faithful functor]] $Spec$ from the category of $\Top$ of topological spaces to the category $\Pros$ of preordered sets.

In the other direction, to each proset $X$ we may associate a topological space whose elements are those of $X$, and whose open sets are precisely the upward-closed sets with respect to the preorder. This topology is called the [[specialization topology]]. This defines a functor 

$$i \colon ProSet \to Top$$ 

which is a full embedding; the [[essential image]] of this functor is the category of [[Alexandroff spaces]] (spaces in which an arbitrary intersection of open sets is open). Hence the category of prosets is equivalent to the category of Alexandroff spaces. 

In fact, we have an adjunction $i \dashv Spec$, making $ProSet$ a [[coreflective subcategory]] of $Top$. In particular, the counit evaluated at a space $X$, 

$$i(Spec(X)) \to X,$$ 

is the identity function at the level of sets, and is continuous because any open $U$ of $X$ is upward-closed with respect to $\leq$, according to the second equivalent condition of the definition of the specialization order. 

This adjunction restricts to an [[adjoint equivalence]] between the categories $\Fin\Pros$ and $\Fin\Top$ of finite prosets and finite topological spaces. The unit and counit are both identity functions at the level of sets, so we in fact have an equivalence between these categories as [[concrete categories]].
