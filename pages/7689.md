###### Definition
A not necesarily commutative connected formal group $G=\Sp f A$ is called *[[smooth formal k-group]] if $A$ is a power-series algebra $k[ [X_1,...X_n] ]$ in $n$ variables

The coproduct $\Delta:A\to A\hat \otimes A$ is given by a set af formal power series $\Phi(X,Y)=(\Phi_i(X_1,..., X_n, Y_1,..., Y_n)), i_1,...,n$ satisfying the axioms (Ass),(Un) and (Com). Such a set $\{\Phi_i\}$ is called a *Dieudonn√© group law*.

###### Theorem
Let $G=Sp f A$ be a (not necessarily commutative) connected formal group of finite type.
1.If $p=0$ then $G$ is smooth.

1. If $p\not =0$ then the following conditions are equivalent


1. $G$ is smooth

1. $A\otimes_k k^{p-1}$ is reduced.

1. $F_G$ is an epimorphism.
