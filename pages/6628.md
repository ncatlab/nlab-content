## Definition


### Nonabelian 2-gerbes

For $\mathcal{X}$ an [[(∞,1)-topos]], a **2-gerbe** $P$ in $\mathcal{X}$ is an object which is

1. [[1-connective]];

1. [[2-truncated]].


The first condition says that it is an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] with values in [[2-groupoid]]s. The second says that $P \to *$ is an [[effective epimorphism]] and that the [[categorical homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|0-th homotopy sheaf]] is the terminal sheaf. In the literature this is often stated as saying that $P$ is a) _locally connected_ and b) _locally non-empty_ .


### Abelian 2-gerbes

For $\mathcal{X}$ an [[(∞,1)-topos]], an  **abelian 2-gerbe** $P$ in $\mathcal{X}$ is an object which is

1. [[2-truncated]];

1. [[2-connected]].
