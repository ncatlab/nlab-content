### For topological spaces
 {#ForTopologicalSpaces}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X = (X,\tau)$ a [[topological space]], a __[[base]]__ or __basis__ for (or "of") the topology of $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{U}\subset \tau$ of [[open subsets]] -- called __basic open subsets__ or __generating open subsets__ -- such that every open subset is a [[union]] of basic ones.

A __subbase__ of the topology of $X$ is a collection $S\subset \tau$ of open subsets such that all finite intersections of sets belong to $S$ is a base of topology of $(X,\tau)$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If one thinks of the topology on $X$ as being encoded in the standard [[Grothendieck topology]] that it induces on its [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$, then a base for the topology induces a _[[coverage]]_ on $Op(X)$, whose covering families are the open covers by basic open subsets, which generates this Grothendieck topology.

This connects to the more general definition \ref{BasisForGrothendieckTopology} below.

###### Definition

 Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and $x\in X$ a point. A __base of neighborhoods__ of $x$ in $(X,\tau)$ or a __fundamental system of neighborhoods__ of $X$ is a family $B\subset \tau$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that for any neighborhood $U\ni x$ there is a neighborhood $b\ni x$ such that $b\in B$ and $b\subset U$. Some also say (local base of topology at $x$). The minimal cardinality of a base of neighborhoods at $x$ is called a character of $(X,\tau)$ at $x$, and the supremum of characters at all point is a character of $(X,\tau)$. If it is countable we say that the topological space satisfies the first axiom of separability.

### For sites / Grothendieck topologies
 {#ForSites}

+-- {: .num_defn #BasisForGrothendieckTopology}
###### Definition

For $C$ a [[category]] with [[pullbacks]] and equipped with a [[Grothendieck topology]], a [[basis for the Grothendieck topology]] is a [[coverage]] that generates this Grothendieck topology and which is stable under pullback and is transitive.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(Warning)**

Unfortunately the established terminology "basis" in [[topology]] and [[topos theory]]  is not quite consistent with the inclusion of topological spaces into topos theory:

because the collection of basic open subsets of a base for a topological space $X$ is in general not closed under [[intersection]] with open subsets, this [[coverage]] on $Op(X)$ is in general _not_ a [[basis for a Grothendieck topology]] (a [[Grothendieck pretopology]]) on $Op(X)$.

So "basis" in topology corresponds to _[[coverage]]_ in topos theory, not to "basis" in topos theory.

On the other hand, some authors avoid the term [[basis for a Grothendieck topology]] and say [[Grothendieck pretopology]] instead.

## Examples

We list examples for bases of topological spaces. For examples of bases of Grothendieck topologies see _[[basis for a Grothendieck topology]]_ instead.

###### Example

For the [[discrete topology]] on a set $X$, the collection of all [[singleton]] subsets is a base.

###### Example

For every [[metric space]], in particular every [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[manifold]], the collection of [[open subsets]] that are [[open balls]] forms a base for the topology.

###### Remark

This means that [[covering]] families consisting of such _basic_ open subsets are [[good open covers]].

###### Example

For instance a base for the topology on the [[real line]] is given by the collection of open intervals $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$.
