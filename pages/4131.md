## Idea

A _base_ or _subbase_ for a [[topological space]] is a way of generating its topology from something simpler.  This is the appliction to topology of the general concept of [[base]].


## Definition {#ForTopologicalSpaces}

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and let $\tau$ be its collection of [[open subsets]] (its 'topology').

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __base__ or __basis__ for (or "of") $X$ (or $\tau$) is a [[subset|collection]] $B \subset \tau$ -- whose members are called __basic open subsets__ or __generating open subsets__ -- such that every open subset is a [[union]] of basic ones.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __subbase__ for (or "of") $X$ (or $\tau$) is a subcollection $S \subset \tau$ -- whose members are called __subbasic open subsets__ -- such that every open subset is a [[union]] of [[finitary intersections]] of subbasic ones.
=--

If only the [[underlying set]] of $X$ is given, then a __base__ or __subbase__ on this [[set]] is any collection of [[subsets]] of $X$ that is a base or subbase for *some* topology on $X$.  See [below](#generation) for a characterisation of which collections these can be.

Now fix a [[point]] $a$ in $X$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __local base__ or __base of neighborhoods__ or __fundamental system of neighborhoods__ for (or "of") $X$ (or $\tau$) at $a$ is a subcollection $B \subset \tau$ -- whose members are called __basic neighborhoods__ or __generating neighborhoods__ of $a$ -- such that every basic neighborhood of $a$ is a [[neighborhood]] and every neighborhood of $a$ is a [[superset]] of some basic neighborhood.
=--

We may also allow basic neighborhoods to be non-open, but this really doesn\'t make any difference; any local base may be refined to a local base of open neighborhoods, and most local bases in practices already come that way.

A __local subbase__ at $a$ is a family of neighbourhoods $a$ such that each neighbourhood of $a$ contains a finite [[intersection]] of elements of the family.

+-- {.num_defn}
###### Definition

The minimum [[cardinality]] of a base of $X$ is the __weight__ of $X$.  The minimum cardinality of a base of neighborhoods at $a$ is the __character__ of $X$ at $a$.  The [[supremum]] of the characters at all points of $X$ is the __character__ of $X$.
=--

We have assumed the [[axiom of choice]] to simplify the description of this concept; but in general one must speak of classes of cardinalities rather than individual cardinalities.

If the character of $X$ is [[countable set|countable]], we say that $X$ satisfies the [[first-countable space|first axiom of countability]]; if the weight is countable, we say that $X$ satisfies the [[second-countable space|second axiom of countability]].


## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For the [[discrete topology]] on a set $X$, the collection of all [[singleton]] subsets is a base, and the singleton $\{x\}$ is a local base at $x$.  Thus every discrete space is first-countable, but only [[countable set|countable]] discrete spaces are second-countable.
=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For every [[metric space]], in particular every [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[Riemannian manifold]], the collection of [[open subsets]] that are [[open balls]] forms a base for the topology.  (For instance, a base for the topology on the [[real line]] is given by the collection of open intervals $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$.)  Similarly, the collection of open balls containing a given point is a local basis at that point.
=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that [[covering]] families consisting of such _basic_ open subsets are [[good open covers]].
=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Refining the previous example, every [[metric space]] has a basis consisting of the [[open balls]] with *[[rational number|rational]]* radius.  (For instance, a base for the topology on the [[real line]] is given by the collection of open intervals $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$ where $b - a$ is rational.)  Similarly, the collection of open balls with rational radius containing a given point is a local base at that point.  Therefore, every metric space is first-countable.
=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Now consider a [[separable space|separable]] metric space; that is, we have a [[dense subset]] $D$ which is [[countable set|countable]].  Now the space has a basis consisting of the [[open balls]] with [[rational number|rational]] radius and centres in $D$.  (For instance, a base for the topology on the [[real line]] is given by the collection of open intervals $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$ where $a$ and $b$ are rational.)  Therefore, every separable metric space is second-countable.
=--


## Generating topologies {#generation}

Let $X$ be simply a [[set]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A collection $B$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ is a base for *some* topology on $X$ iff these conditions are met:

*  $B$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]];
*  if $U, V \in B$, then $U \cap V$ contains some element of $B$.
=--

This is a sort of colax closure (see [discussion](http://nforum.mathforge.org/discussion/4188/laxness-of-bases-of-topologies/)) under [[finitary intersections]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

*Every* collection $S$ of subsets of $X$ is a subbase for some topology on $X$.
=--

A subbase naturally generates a base (for the same topology) by [[Moore closure|closing]] it under finitary intersections.  (The resulting base will actually be closed under intersection, not just colax-closed.)


## Relation to Grothendieck topologies and coverages
 {#ForSites}

If one thinks of the topology on $X$ as being encoded in the standard [[Grothendieck topology]] that it induces on its [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$, then a base for the topology induces a _[[coverage]]_ on $Op(X)$, whose covering families are the open covers by basic open subsets, which generates this Grothendieck topology.

This coverage is *not* in general a [[basis for the Grothendieck topology]], because a base for a topological space is in general not closed under [[intersection]] with arbitrary [[open subsets]]; a coverage is only a basis if is stable under [[pullback]] (here, closed under these intersections) and transitive.  Unfortunately the established terminology "basis" in [[topology]] and [[topos theory]] is not quite consistent with the inclusion of topological spaces into topos theory: "basis" in topology corresponds to "coverage" in topos theory, not to "basis" in topos theory.
