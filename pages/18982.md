## Definition

In [[measure theory]], the _pushforward_ $f_\ast \mu$ of a [[measure]] $\mu$ on a [[measurable space]] $X$ along a [[measurable function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ to another [[measure space]] $Y$ assigns to a subset the original measure of the [[preimage]] under $f$ of that subset:

$$
  (f_\ast\mu)( - ) \coloneqq \mu(f^{-1}(-))
  \,.
$$
