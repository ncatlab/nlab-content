## Idea

The notion of [[vector bundle]] in [[algebraic geometry]].

Usually characterized in terms of its [[sheaf]] of [[sections]] on the [[locally ringed site]] (with [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}$) of the given [[scheme]]: a locally free $\mathcal{O}$-module of finite [[rank]].

## Properties

### Relation to analytic vector bundles
 {#RelationToAnalyticVectorBundles}

Over the [[complex numbers]], [[GAGA]] relates algebraic to [[holomorphic vector bundles]] (e.g. [Neeman 07, theorem 1.1.4](#Neeman07)).
