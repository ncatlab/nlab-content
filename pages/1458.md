The [[tensor product]] of [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable]] $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|categories]] is the product in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of presentable (infinity,1)-categories]].

This is the $(\infty,1)$-category $C \otimes D$ which is 'the universal recipient of a bilinear functor' from $C \times D$. Here, we think of coproducts in $C$ and $D$ as addition, and then if a functor $C \times D \to E$ preserves colimits in each variable, in particular it preserves coproducts and so is 'bilinear'. Such a bilinear functor will factor uniquely (in a homotopic sense) through a universal bilinear functor $C \times D \to C \otimes D$, just like for bilinear maps and tensor products of abelian groups.
