A **dg-category** or **differential graded category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over a [[symmetric monoidal category]] of chain complexes, usually taken to be that of chain complexes of $k$-vector spaces for some field $k$: $dgCat := Ch(Mod_k)-Cat$.

A dg-category $\mathbf{B}A$ with a single object is a _differential graded [[algebra]]_ $A$.
