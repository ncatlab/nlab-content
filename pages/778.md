A **dg-category** or **differential graded category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over a [[symmetric monoidal category]] of chain complexes, usually taken to be that of chain complexes of $k$-vector spaces for some field $k$: $dgCat := Ch(Mod_k)-Cat$.

A dg-category $\mathbf{B}A$ with a single object is a _differential graded [[algebra]]_ $A$.

+--{.query}
[[Tim Porter|Tim]] : Is there an nLab policy on the meaning of chain complexes and dg-algebras?  Are the differentials of degree +1 or -1?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: to me it seems that one should stick to

$$
  \array{
    & \mathbf{name of differential} & \mathbf{degree of differential}
    \\
    chain complex & boundary operator & -1
    \\
    cochain complex & coboundary operator & +1
  }
$$

if one runs into a differential that feels like it 
ought to be called
a "boundary operator" but which still raises degree 
instead of lowering it one should be prepared to 
admit that one should choose the other overall sign
convention for the grading.
