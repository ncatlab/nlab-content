A **dg-category** or **differential graded category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over a [[symmetric monoidal category]] of chain complexes, usually taken to be that of chain complexes of $k$-vector spaces for some field $k$: $dgCat := Ch(Mod_k)-Cat$.

A dg-category $\mathbf{B}A$ with a single object is a _differential graded [[algebra]]_ $A$.

Given that last statement, it would seem to make sense to call these "differential graded algebroids". How established is the term "differential graded category"? Is it too late to change even if it made sense to do so? - [[Eric Forgy|Eric]]

[[Tim Porter|Tim]] : Is there an nLab policy on the meaning of chain complexes and dg-algebras?  Are the differentials of degree +1 or -1?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: to me it seems that one should stick to

$$
  \array{
    & \mathbf{name of differential} & \mathbf{degree of differential}
    \\
    chain complex & boundary operator & -1
    \\
    cochain complex & coboundary operator & +1
  }
$$

if one runs into a differential that feels like it 
ought to be called
a "boundary operator" but which still raises degree 
instead of lowering it one should be prepared to 
admit that one should choose the other overall sign
convention for the grading.

[[Tim Porter|Tim]] : That would be my choice as well.  I believe the Toen convention is with cochain complexes however. All the dgas tend to have cochain complexes underlying them, so perhaps we should provide some new entries to set up a suitable set of notation and terminology. We will need it if we start talking about infinity algebras whether Lie or otherwise.
