* [[Saunders Mac Lane]],

  _Lectures on category theory_

  Bowdoin Summer School 1969

  Notes taken by [[Ellis Cooper]] ([pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12630719/MacLaneBowdoinLectures69.pdf))

on [[category theory]]. 

These lectures are close to what eventually became the classical textbook _[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]_.  One difference is a long discussion of [[William Lawvere]]'s dissertation results on [[algebraic theories]].
