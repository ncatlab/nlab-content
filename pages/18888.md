## Idea

A **Turing machine** is a [[model of computation]]. It can be thought of as a machine with an internal state that uses an infinite piece of tape. Every timestep, it can, in this order:

* Remove or change the symbol that it is currently pointing to;

* Point to the square of tape to the left or to the right of the square that it is currently pointing to;

* Change its state.

It then repeats this sequence until its state is a final state.
