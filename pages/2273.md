Given a Lie group $G$, it acts on the dual $g^*$ of the Lie algebra $g$ by the __coadjoint action__. [[orbit|Orbits]] of that action are called coadjoint orbits. They are especially important in the orbit method of representation theory or, more generally, [[geometric quantization]].

A dual $g^*$ of (say a finite-dimensional real) __Lie algebra__ has a structure of a [[Poisson manifold]] with the Poisson structure due A. Kirillov and Souriau, namely for any $a\in g^*$, 

$$
\{ f, g\}(a) := \lt [df_a, dg_a],a\gt
$$


The coadjoint orbits are the symplectic leaves of that structure; hence each orbit is a symplectic manifold.

Sometimes coadjoint orbits are sometimes studied in infinite-dimensional case (for example in study of Virasoro algebra).
