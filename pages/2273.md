A dual $g^*$ of (say a fiite-dimensional real) __Lie algebra__ has a structure of a [[Poisson manifold]] with the Poisson structure due A. Kirillov and Souriau, namely for any $a\in g^*$, 

$$
\{ f, g\}(a) := \lt [df_a, dg_a],a\gt
$$


The symplectic leaves of that structure are the __coadjoint orbits__.

This is used especially in [[geometric quantization]].
