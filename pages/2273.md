Given a [[Lie group]] $G$, it [[action|acts]] smoothly on the dual $g^*$ of its [[Lie algebra]] $g$ by the __coadjoint action__.  The [[orbit|orbits]] of that action are called __coadjoint orbits__. They are especially important in the orbit method of [[representation theory]] or, more generally, [[geometric quantization]].

The dual $g^*$ of a (say finite-dimensional real) [[Lie algebra]] has a structure of a [[Poisson manifold]] with the Poisson structure due to A. Kirillov and Souriau, namely for any $a\in g^*$, 

$$
\{ f, g\}(a) := \langle [d f_a, d g_a],a\rangle
$$


The coadjoint orbits are the symplectic leaves of that structure; hence each orbit is a [[symplectic manifold]].

Sometimes coadjoint orbits are studied in the infinite-dimensional case (for example in study of [[Virasoro algebra]]).
