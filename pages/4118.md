## Definition

A ([[discrete group|discrete]]) [[group]] $G$ is **perfect** if it is equal to its own [[commutator subgroup]] $[G, G]$, i.e., if every [[element]] of $G$ is a product of [[commutators]] (elements of the form $[g, h] = g h g^{-1} h^{-1}$). 

Equivalently: let $G^{ab}$ denote the [[abelianization]] of $G$ (the target of the [[homomorphism]] $G \to G^{ab}$ that is [[universal property|universal]] among homomorphisms from $G$ to [[abelian groups]], or the largest abelian quotient of $G$). Then $G$ is perfect precisely when $G^{ab}$ is a [[trivial group]], since 
$G^{ab} \cong G/[G, G]$:

$$
  G \;\; \text{perfect}
  \;\;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;\;
  G^{ab} \;\; \text{is trivial}
  \,.
$$


## Examples

\begin{example}
The [[trivial group]] is perfect, trivially.

###### Proposition

The [[alternating group]] $A_5$ is the smallest nontrivial perfect group.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #2IIsPerfect}
###### Proposition

The [[binary icosahedral group]] $2I$ is a [[perfect group]]: its [[abelianization]] is the [[trivial group]].

In fact, up to [[isomorphism]], the [[binary icosahedral group]] is the unique [[finite group]] of [[order of a group|order]] 120 which is a [[perfect group]].

=--

Since $2I \simeq SL_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ ([this prop.](icosahedral+group#IsomorphismToSL25)), this is a special case of the following class of examples:

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 

The [[special linear group]] $SL_n(\mathbb{F})$ is perfect for any [[field]] $\mathbb{F}$ and any $n \geq 1$, except for the cases $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$.

See for example [here](http://people.brandeis.edu/~igusa/Math101b/SL.pdf), or [Lang 02, theorems XIII 8.3 and 9.2](#Lang02). Notice that the smallest of this class of examples is $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$, of order $60$. In a moment we give a simple argument that this example is isomorphic to $A_5$. 
 
+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
A [[quotient group]] of a perfect group is again perfect. 
=-- 

This last assertion is easy to see: $G$ is perfect if it has no nontrivial abelian quotients. If a quotient $H$ had a nontrivial abelian quotient, then obviously so would $G$. 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
Given that there are no nontrivial perfect groups of order less than $60$, this proposition shows that $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$ cannot have a proper nontrivial quotient, i.e., it is a [[simple group]]. Since $A_5$ is up to isomorphism the only simple group of order $60$, there must be a (non-canonical) isomorphism $A_5 \cong SL_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$.

###### Proposition 
An arbitrary colimit of perfect groups (as calculated in [[Grp]], the category of groups) is again perfect. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The abelianization functor, being a [[left adjoint]], preserves a [[colimit]] of perfect groups $colim_i G_i$, taking it to $colim_i (G_i)^{ab} \cong \colim_i 1 \cong 1$ (since an arbitrary colimit of [[initial object]]s is again initial).

\begin{example}\label{TerminalEpimorphismsInInfinityGroupoids}
  If the [[terminal object in an (infinity,1)-category|terminal map]] $\mathbf{B}G \to \ast$ out of the [[delooping groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of a [[discrete group]] $G$ is an [[epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|epimorphism in the $\infty$-category]] [[Infinity-Grpd|$Grpd_\infty$]] of [[infinity-groupoid|$\infty$-groupoids]], then $G$ must be perfect (see the discussion [there](epimorphism+in+an+infinity1-category#TerminalEpimorphismsInInfinityGroupoids)).
