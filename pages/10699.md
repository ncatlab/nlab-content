## Idea

In the [[physics]] of [[quantum field theory]], _cluster decomposition_ is a property of [[correlators]]/[[scattering amplitudes]] which expresses the [[local quantum field theory|locality]] property. Roughly it says that interaction between many [[field (physics)|fields]] can be decomposed into those within localized clusters.
