## Idea

Syntactic _substitution_ for [[variables]] is one of the basic operations in formal mathematics, such as symbolic [[logic]] and [[type theory|type theories]]. 


## Syntactic substitution

Substitution is usually defined as an *operation* on expressions containing variables.  (These expressions may be [[terms]], [[formulas]], [[propositions]], [[dependent types]], etc.)  Suppose that $P$ an expression in the [[context]] of a [[variable]] $x$, and that $t$ is an expression which has the same type as $x$.  Then we denote by 

$$ P[t/x] $$

the result of **substituting** $t$ for all occurrences of $x$ in $P$.

For example, if $P$ is $x^2 + 2x y + 3$ and $t$ is $(y+z)$, then $P[t/x]$ is $(y+z)^2 + 2(y+z)y + 3$.

Note that in this approach, substitution is an *operation on syntax*, not an element of syntax itself.  In particular, the bracket notation $[t/x]$ is part of "meta-syntax", not the syntax in question.  That is, the literal string of symbols "$P[t/x]$" is not itself an expression in the language under consideration, but *denotes* such an expression, in the same way that "$2+2$" is not literally an integer but *denotes* the integer $4$.


### Simultaneous substitution

Substitution for multiple variables does not, in general, commute.  That is,

$$P[t/x][s/y] \qquad\text{and}\qquad P[s/y][t/x]$$

are not in general the same: the former substitutes $s$ for occurrences of $y$ in $t$, but not $t$ for occurrences of $x$ in $s$, while the latter has the opposite behavior.  We also write

$$ P[t,s/x,y] $$

to denote the *simultaneous substitution* of $t$ for $x$ and $s$ for $y$, in which *neither* occurrences of $x$ in $s$ nor occurrences of $y$ in $t$ are substituted for; this is generally not the same as either iterated substitution.


### Avoiding variable capture

If the language in question contains variable [[bound variable|binders]], then there is a subtlety to substitution: if $t$ contains free variables that are bound in $P$, then we cannot simply textually substitute $t$ for $x$ and obtain an expression with the desired meaning.

For instance, if $P$ is $\exists y (x + y = 1)$, and $t$ is the free variable $y$, then a literal interpretation of $P[t/x]$ would produce $\exists y (y + y = 1)$.  But $P$ is true (universally in its free variables) if the variables have type $\mathbb{Z}$, while $\exists y (y + y = 1)$ is not.  The free variable $y$ in $t$ has been "captured" by the binder $\exists y$ in $P$.

We say that $t$ is **substitutable** for $x$ in $P$ if performing a literal textual substitution as above would not result in undesired variable capture.  If $t$ is not substitutable for $x$ in $P$, then we can always replace $P$ by an [[alpha-equivalent]] expression in which $t$ *is* substitutable for $x$.  Since we often consider formulas only up to $\alpha$-equivalence anyway, one usually defines the notation "$P[t/x]$" to include an $\alpha$-conversion of $P$, if necessary, to make $t$ substitutable for $x$.

In computer implementations of type theories, however, the issue of variable binding and capture is one of the trickiest things to get right.  Performing $\alpha$-conversions is difficult and tedious, and other solutions exist, such as using [[de Brujin indices]] to represent bound variables.


### As an admissible rule

A general property of type theories (and other formal mathematics) is that *substitution is an admissible rule*.  Roughly, this means that if $P$ is an expression of some type, then so is the result $P[t/x]$ of substitution (as long as $t$ and $x$ have the same type).  This is generally not a rule "put into" the theory, but rather a property one *proves* about the theory; type theorists say that substitution is an [[admissible rule]] rather than a [[derivable rule]].

For instance, in the language of [[dependent type theory]] we can show that the following substitution rule is admissible:

$$ \frac{\Gamma \vdash (t:A) \qquad (x:A) \vdash P \;type}{\Gamma \vdash P[t/x] \;type} $$

Here "admissibility" means that if there exist derivations of $\Gamma \vdash (t:A)$ and $(x:A) \vdash P \;type$, then there also exists a derivation of $\Gamma \vdash P[t/x] \;type$.  By contrast, saying that this is a derivable rule would mean that it can occur itself as *part* of a derivation, rather than being a meta-statement *about* derivations.

The substition rule is closely related to the [[cut rule]], and admissibility of such rules is generally proven by [[cut elimination]].


## Explicit substitution

An alternative approach to substitution is to make substitution part of the object language rather than the metalanguage.  That is, the notation

$$P[t/x]$$

is now actually itself a string of the language under consideration.  One then needs reduction or equality rules describing the relationship of this string $P[t/x]$ to the result of actually substituting $t$ for $x$ as in the usual approach.  See [[explicit substitution]] for more details.


## Categorical semantics
 {#CategoricalSemantics}

### Definition

In the [[categorical semantics]] of [[type theory]]:

* Recalling that [[terms]] are interpreted by [[morphisms]], substitution of a term into another term is interpreted by [[composition]] of the relevant morphisms.

* Recalling that [[propositions]] are interpreted by [[subobjects]], substitution of a term $t$ into a proposition $P$ is interpreted by [[pullback]] or [[inverse image]] of the subobject interpreting $P$ along the morphism interpreting $t$.

* Recalling that [[dependent types]] are interpreted by [[display maps]], substitution of a term $t$ into a dependent type $B$ is interpreted by [[pullback]] of the display map interpreting $B$ along the morphism interpreting $t$.

* Or else, since [[dependent types]] are also given by [[classifying morphisms]] into a [[type of types]], substitution corresponds to [[composition]] of these classifying morphisms with the given morphism.

In the third case, there is a [[coherence]] issue: syntactic substitution in the usual approach is strictly [[associativity|associative]], whereas pullback in a category is not.  One way to deal with this is by using explicit substitution as described above.  Another way is to strictify the category before modeling type theory; see _[[categorical model of dependent types]]_. For literature see ([Curien-Garner-Hofmann](#CurienGarnerHofmann), [Lumsdaine-Warren 13](#LumsdaineWarren13)).


### Examples

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a suitable ambient [[category]] in which we are [[categorical semantics|interpreting]] [[logic]]/[[type theory]].

Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are [[types]], hence interpreted as [[objects]] of $\mathcal{C}$. Then a [[term]] of [[function type]] $f : X \to Y$ is interpreted by a [[morphism]], going by the same symbols.

Now a [[proposition]] about [[terms]] of [[type]] $Y$

$$
  y : Y \vdash P(y)
$$

is interpreted as an [[object]] of the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/Y}$, specifically as a [[truncated object of an (infinity,1)-category|(-1)-truncated]] object if it is to be a [[proposition]], hence by a [[monomorphism]]

$$
  \array{
    P 
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

For instance if $\mathcal{C} = $ [[Set]] then this is the inclusion of the [[subset]] of elements of $Y$ on which $P$ is true. And generally we may write

$$
  P = \{y : Y | isInhab(P(y)) \}
  \,.
$$

Now finally the **substitution** of $f(x)$ for $y$ in $P$, hence the proposition 

$$
  \array{
    P(f(-))
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    X
  }  
$$

is interpreted as the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    P(f(-)) \coloneqq & f^* P &\to& P
    \\
    & \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    & X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that [[monomorphisms]] are preserved by pullback, so that this is indeed again the correct interpretation of a proposition.

Specifically, if $X$ is the [[unit]] type it is interpreted as a [[terminal object]] of $\mathcal{C}$, and then the [[function]] $f$ is identified simply with a [[term]] $y_0 \coloneqq f(*) $. In this case the substitution is _evaluation_ of the proposition at $y_0$, the resulting monomorphism

$$
  \array{
    P(y_0) &\to& P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{y_0}{\to}& Y
  }
$$

over the terminal object is a [[truth value]]: the truth value of $P$ at $y_0$.
