## Idea

The syntactic _substitution_ of [[variables]] is one of the basic operations in formal mathematics / symbolic [[logic]] such as given by [[type theories]]. 

For the moment see at _[[category of contexts]]_ for more details.

## Categorical semantics


In the [[categorical semantics]] of [[type theory]], variable substitute is interpreted by [[pullback]] / [[base change]] along the morphism that interprets the term in question.
