##Idea

This entry relates to a series of papers by [[Clark Barwick]] and colleagues which aim to provide common foundations for several different parts of [[homotopy theory]], among which [[equivariant homotopy theory]], [[parametrized homotopy theory]], [[global homotopy theory]] and [[Goodwillie calculus]].

An important ingredient of this program is the concept of an _atomic orbital $\infty$-category_ which is defined in terms of important properties of the [[orbit category]] of a finite group $G$:
{#AtomicOrbital}

1. **Orbital**: Fiber products of representable presheaves are finite disjoint unions of representable presheaves (a restatement of the fact that the category of finite $G$-sets has pullbacks ([Mackey decomposition](double+coset#MackeyFormula)), so a version of the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]]);

1. **Atomic**: The triviality of retracts (that is every retraction is an equivalence).

Examples of such $(\infty, 1)$-categories satisfying these two properties include: [[orbit categories]] of finite groups, and more generally, orbit categories of profinite groups (where the stabilizers are required to be open) and locally finite groups (where the stabilizers are required to be finite); any $\infty$-groupoid; the cyclonic orbit 2-category; the 2-category of finite connected groupoids and covering maps; the category of finite sets of cardinality $\leq n$ and surjective maps; the topological categories of finite-dimensional inner product spaces (over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$) of dimension $\leq n$ and orthogonal projections.

The program looks to generate results which hold for all orbital analytic $\infty$-categories.
