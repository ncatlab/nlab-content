##Idea

This entry relates to a series of papers by [[Clark Barwick]] and colleagues which aim to provide common foundations for several different parts of [[homotopy theory]], among which [[equivariant homotopy theory]], [[parametrized homotopy theory]], [[global homotopy theory]] and [[Goodwillie calculus]].

##Papers

Along with an introduction, nine expos&eacute;s are planned:

* (with Emanuele Dotto, Saul Glasman, Denis Nardin, and Jay Shah), _Parametrized higher category theory and higher algebra: A general introduction_, ([pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1741495/papers/introduction.pdf))


* (with Emanuele Dotto, Saul Glasman, Denis Nardin, and Jay Shah), _Parametrized higher category theory and higher algebra: Exposé I – Elements of parametrized higher category theory_, ([pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1741495/papers/basics.pdf))

* Denis Nardin, _Parametrized higher category theory and higher algebra: Exposé IV - Stability with respect to an orbital ∞-category, ([arXiv:1608.07704](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07704))
