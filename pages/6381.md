## Idea

The _height_ of a [[variety]] should reflect how close the variety is to being ordinary and other arithmetic properties.


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[proper scheme|proper]] $n$ [[dimension|dimensional]] [[variety]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$ of [[characteristic]] $p$. Then one can define the [[Artin-Mazur formal group]] $\Phi$. Since it is a one-dimensional [[formal group]], it is completely determined up to [[isomorphism]] by its [[height]]. This is the **height of the variety** . The height could be infinite if $\Phi\simeq \widehat{\mathbb{G}_a}$, otherwise $\Phi$ is a $p$-[[divisible group]].



### Examples

For an [[elliptic curve]], the height is either $1$ in which case it is ordinary, or $2$ in which case it is supersingular.

A [[Calabi-Yau variety]] of any dimension is ordinary if and only if it has height $1$. For [[K3 surfaces]] the height is less than or equal to $10$ or infinite, but for all higher dimensional Calabi-Yau varieties the height has no known bound. Infinite height Calabi-Yau varieties are known as supersingular.

The height of an [[abelian variety]] depends on its $p$-rank, but must be $1$, $2$, or infinite.
