## Idea

In [[set theory]], the __axiom scheme of separation__ aka __specification__ states that, given any [[set]] $X$ and any [[property]] $P$ of the [[elements]] of $X$, there is a set
$$ \{ X | P \} = \{ a \in X \;|\; P(a) \} $$
consisting precisely of those elements of $X$ for which $P$ holds:
$$ a \in \{ X | P \} \;\leftrightarrow\; a \in X \;\wedge\; P(a) .$$
Note that $\{X|P\}$ is a [[subset]] of $X$.

It is important to specify what language $P$ can be written in.  This connects the axiom to [[logic]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]].  Arguably, [[first-order logic]] developed in order to explain the meaning of [[Ernst Zermelo]]\'s axiom of separation (although Zermelo himself disagreed with the interpretation that this gave).  Separation is (usually) given as an axiom *scheme* because there is one axiom for each way to state a property in the language.  (We also allow parameters in $P$.)


## Statements

From weaker to stronger:

*  For __bounded separation__ aka __restricted separation__ aka __$\Delta_0$-separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order set theory and all [[quantifications]] must be guarded by a set: of the form $\forall x \in A$ or $\exists x \in A$ for some set $A$.

*  For __limited separation__ aka __$\Delta_0^{\mathcal{P}}$-separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order set theory and all quantifications must be guarded by a set or a [[power class]]: of the form $\forall x \in A$, $\exists B \subseteq A$, etc.  Limited separation trivially implies bounded separation, while bounded separation implies limited separation if [[power sets]] exist.

*  For __full separation__ aka simply __separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order set theory, but otherwise anything goes; in a [[class theory]], $P$ must be guarded by a class.  Full separation trivially implies limited separation.

*  For __large separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order class theory; of course, this only makes sense *in* a class theory.  The difference in strength between the class theories $MK$ and $NBG$ is precisely that the former has large separation but the latter does not.

*  Separation is sometimes called __restricted comprehension__; for __full comprehension__ aka simply __comprehension__, no set $X$ needs to be given ahead of time.  Full comprehension was proposed by [[Gottlob Frege]], but leads to [[Russell's paradox]].  However, full comprehension can sometimes be allowed if the ambient logic is nonclassical, such as [[linear logic]] or [[paraconsistent logic]].

*  For __stratified comprehension__, no set $X$ is given, but $P$ is restricted to stratified formulas, in which each [[variable]] $x$ can be given a consistent [[natural number]] $\sigma(x)$ (its stratification) such that $x \in y$ appears in the formula only if $\sigma(y) = \sigma(x) + 1$.  This is used in [[Van Quine]]\'s [[New Foundations]].


## In structural set theory

Set theory is usually given in [[material set theory|material]] form, with a language based on a global membership relation $\in$, and we have implicitly followed this above.  However, separation makes sense also in [[structural set theory]] (although full comprehension does not, except in a structural class theory with a [[class of all sets]], where it again leads to paradox).  The conclusion of the axiom is the existence of a set
$$ \{ X | P \} = \{ a\colon X \;|\; P(a) \} $$
and an [[injection]] $i_P\colon \{X|P\} \to X$ such that
$$ \forsome b\colon S,\; a = i_P(b) \;\leftrightarrow\; P(a) .$$
Note that $\{X|P\}$, equipped with $i_P$, is a [[subset]] of $X$ in the structural sense.

The structural axioms can of course be stated even in a material set theory, where they are actually weaker than the corresponding material axioms; however, the material axioms follow (as usual) from the structural axioms using [[axiom of replacement|restricted replacement]], which is quite weak (and also follows from the material form of bounded separation).

If a structural set theory is given by stating axioms for the [[category of sets]], then restricted separation amounts to the property that this category is a [[Heyting category]].  If it is an [[elementary topos]], then since it satisfies the power set axiom, this implies limited separation as well.  Full separation is somewhat less natural to state category-theoretically, but the combination of full separation with the structural [[axiom of collection]] is equivalent to saying that the category of sets is [[autological category|autological]].


## Axiom or axiom scheme?

Although usually presented as an axiom scheme, in many cases, all instances of separation follow from finitely many special cases (which can then be packaged into a single axiom, using [[and|conjunction]], although this is probably pointless).  This is the case, for example, in [[ETCS]] (a structural set theory that satisfied bounded separation) and [[NBG]] (a material class theory that satisfies full separation).  In [[type theory|type-theoretic]] foundations of mathematics, separation is usually invisible, but again some form (generally only bounded) can again be proved from a few specific axioms or constructions.


## Relation to the axiom of replacement

Full separation follows from the [[axiom of replacement]] and the principle of [[excluded middle]] (along with the axiom of the [[empty set]]).  Therefore, the axiom is often left out entirely of a description of [[ZFC]] (the usually accepted foundation of mathematics).  In versions of set theory for [[constructive mathematics]], however, we often have replacement but only bounded or limited separation, and in any case separation must be listed explicitly.
