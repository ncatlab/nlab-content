# Axiom schemes of separation

## Idea

In [[set theory]], the __axiom scheme of separation__ aka __specification__ states that, given any [[set]] $X$ and any [[property]] $P$ of the [[elements]] of $X$, there is a set
$$ \{ X | P \} = \{ a \in X \;|\; P(a) \} $$
consisting precisely of those elements of $X$ for which $P$ holds:
$$ a \in \{ X | P \} \;\leftrightarrow\; a \in X \;\wedge\; P(a) .$$
Note that $\{X|P\}$ is a [[subset]] of $X$.

It is important to specify what language $P$ can be written in.  This connects the axiom to [[logic]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]].  Arguably, [[first-order logic]] developed in order to explain the meaning of [[Ernst Zermelo]]\'s axiom of separation (although Zermelo himself disagreed with the interpretation that this gave).  Separation is (usually) given as an axiom *scheme* because there is one axiom for each way to state a property in the language.  (We also allow parameters in $P$.)


## Statements

From weaker to stronger:

*  For __bounded separation__ aka __restricted separation__ aka __$\Delta_0$-separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order set theory and all [[quantifications]] must be guarded by a set: of the form $\forall x \in A$ or $\exists x \in A$ for some set $A$.

*  For __limited separation__ aka __$\Delta_0^{\mathcal{P}}$-separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order set theory and all quantifications must be guarded by a set or a [[power class]]: of the form $\forall x \in A$, $\exists B \subseteq A$, etc.  Limited separation trivially implies bounded separation, while bounded separation implies limited separation if [[power sets]] exist.

*  For __full separation__ aka simply __separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order set theory, but otherwise anything goes; in a [[class theory]], $P$ must be guarded by a class.  Full separation trivially implies limited separation.

*  For __large separation__, $P$ must be written in the language of first-order class theory; of course, this only makes sense *in* a class theory.  The difference in strength between the class theories $MK$ and $NBG$ is precisely that the former has large separation but the latter does not.

*  Separation is sometimes called __restricted comprehension__; for __[[full comprehension]]__, a.k.a. simply __comprehension__, no set $X$ needs to be given ahead of time.  Full comprehension was proposed by [[Gottlob Frege]], but leads to [[Russell's paradox]].  However, full comprehension can sometimes be allowed if the ambient logic is nonclassical, such as [[linear logic]] or [[paraconsistent logic]].

*  For __stratified comprehension__, no set $X$ is given, but $P$ is restricted to stratified formulas, in which each [[variable]] $x$ can be given a consistent [[natural number]] $\sigma(x)$ (its stratification) such that $x \in y$ appears in the formula only if $\sigma(y) = \sigma(x) + 1$.  This is used in [[Van Quine]]\'s [[New Foundations]].


## In structural set theory

Set theory is usually given in [[material set theory|material]] form, with a language based on a global membership relation $\in$, and we have implicitly followed this above.  However, separation makes sense also in [[structural set theory]] (although full comprehension does not, except in a structural class theory with a [[class of all sets]], where it again leads to paradox).  The conclusion of the axiom is the existence of a set
$$ \{ X | P \} = \{ a\colon X \;|\; P(a) \} $$
and an [[injection]] $i_P\colon \{X|P\} \to X$ such that
$$ \exists b\colon S,\; a = i_P(b) \;\leftrightarrow\; P(a) .$$
Note that $\{X|P\}$, equipped with $i_P$, is a [[subset]] of $X$ in the structural sense.

The structural axioms can of course be stated even in a material set theory, where they are actually weaker than the corresponding material axioms; however, the material axioms follow (as usual) from the structural axioms using [[axiom of replacement|restricted replacement]], which is quite weak (and also follows from the material form of limited separation).

If a structural set theory is given by stating axioms for the [[category of sets]], then restricted separation amounts to the property that this category is a [[Heyting category]].  If it is an [[elementary topos]], then since it satisfies the power set axiom, this implies limited separation as well.  Full separation is somewhat less natural to state category-theoretically, but the combination of full separation with the structural [[axiom of collection]] is equivalent to saying that the category of sets is [[autological category|autological]].


## In hyperdoctrines

### Lawvere's definition
 {#LawvereDefinition}

[[Lawvere]] gives a definition ([Lawvere70, p. 12-13](#Lawvere70)) of comprehension in [[hyperdoctrines]].

+-- {: .num_defn #LawvereianComprehension}
###### Definition

Let $p \colon E \to B$ be a [[bifibration]] over the category $B$, and assume that each [[fibre]] $E_X$ of $E$ has a [[terminal object]] $T_X$.  For any [[morphism]] $t \colon Y \to X$ in $B$, define the _image_ $im t$ of $t$ to be the pushforward ([[dependent sum]]) $t_! T_Y$.  This gives rise to a functor $im \colon B/X \to E_X$ for each $X$.  Then $E$ is said to _have comprehension_, or to satisfy the _comprehension schema_, if each image functor has a [[right adjoint]] $\{-\} \colon E_X \to B/X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that for each $P \in E_X$ there is a morphism $i_P \colon \{ P \} \to X$ in $B$ such that there is a [[bijection]] between commuting triangles $t = i_P \circ t'$ in $B$ and morphisms $im t \to P$ in $E_X$.  Lawvere calls the morphism $\{P\} \to X$ the _[[extension (semantics)|extension]]_ of $P$, so that one could say that $E$ satisfies the comprehension schema if the extensions of all predicates exist.

=--

### Ehrhard's reformulation

Notice that, in the above situation, morphisms $\im t \to P$ in $E_X$ are in bijection with morphisms $T_Y \to t^* P$ in $E_Y$, and that these are the same as morphisms $T_Y \to P$ in the total category $E$ that lie over $t$.  This leads to an alternative formulation of the definition, originally considered by [Ehrhard 1988](#Ehrhard88) (see also [Jacobs 1993](#Jacobs93), [Jacobs 99](#Jacobs99)), which does not depend on $p$ being a bifibration.

Suppose the fibres $E_X$ have terminal objects that are preserved by the reindexing functors.  This is equivalent to saying that $p:E\to B$ has a section $T:B\to E$ taking each object $X$ to a terminal object $T_X$ of $E_X$ and each morphism to a cartesian arrow; such a functor is then automatically [[fully faithful]] and [[right adjoint]] to $p:E\to B$.  If $B$ has a terminal object $1$, then this is additionally equivalent to saying that the entire category $E$ has a terminal object $T_1$ preserved by $p$, since then $X^*(T_1)$ will be terminal in $E_X$ by combining the universal properties of $X^*$ and $T_1$.  Note also that if $p$ is a bifibration, as in Lawvere's definition, then the reindexing functors are right adjoints and hence automatically preserve all terminal objects.

Comprehension in the sense above is equivalent to the existence of a further right adjoint to the terminal-object functor $T:B\to E$.

The implication from [Lawvere's definition](#LawvereDefinition) to Ehrhard's is clear.  Conversely, if a fibration $p \colon E \to B$ satisfies the Ehrhard definition, then there is a bijection between morphisms $T_Y \to P$ in $E$ and morphisms $Y \to \{P\}$ in $B$.  One must then show that the composite of this last with the canonical $\{P\} \to X$ (given by $p$ applied to the counit $T_{\{P\}} \to P$) is equal to $p$ applied to the morphism $Y \to \{P\}$, thus giving a morphism in $B/X$ of the right sort.  But in fact the morphism $Y \to \{P\}$ is unique with the property that applying the functor $T_{-}$ and composing with the counit gives the morphism $T_Y \to P$, by the counit's universal property, and applying $p$ to this commuting triangle in $E$ produces the required one in $B$.

### Examples

#### Subsets

The tautological example which is useful to see what the abstract [definition by Lawvere](#LawvereDefinition) axiomatizes is the following.

Let $B = $[[Set]] be the category of sets and for $X$ a [[set]] let $E_X$ be the [[poset]] of [[subsets]] of $X$, regarded as the [[propositions]] about elements in $X$. Then comprehension exists and is given by sending a subset of $X$ regarded as an object of $E_X$ (hence regarded as a proposition) to the same subset, but now regarded as a [[monomorphism]] in [[Set]] into $X$.

More generally, the same construction works for the posets of subobjects in any [[regular category]].

#### Presheaves

There is a functor $Cat_1^{op} \to CAT_1$, from the [[large category|large]] [[Cat|1-category of categories]] and functors to the '[[very large category|very large]]' 1-category of large categories and functors, that sends a category $C$ to the [[category of presheaves]] $[C^{op}, Set]$  on $C$, and a functor $F \colon C \to D$ to the pullback functor $F^* \colon [D^{op}, Set] \to [C^{op}, Set]$.  These pullback functors have left and right adjoints given by [[Kan extension]].

[Lawvere 70](#Lawvere70) shows that this fibration has comprehension, with the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a presheaf given by its [[category of elements]] together with the canonical projection from this to the base category.

#### In dependent linear type theory
 {#ExamplesDependentLinearTypeTheory}

If the [[hyperdoctrine]] has [[linear type theories]]/[[symmetric monoidal categories]] as fibers, then it is more natural to consider in def. \ref{LawvereianComprehension} not the [[terminal object]] in some fiber (if any) but the [[tensor unit]] (which of course happens to be the terminal object in the case of [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal]]) fibers.

In this case then the image functor in def. \ref{LawvereianComprehension} is 

$$
  \Sigma_X \;\colon\; (Y \stackrel{f}{\to} X) \mapsto \underset{f}{\sum} 1_Y 
  \,.
$$

If this has a [[right adjoint]] $R_X$, hence if we have linear comprehension according to def. \ref{LawvereianComprehension}, then the induced [[comonad]]

$$
  !_X \coloneqq \Sigma_X \circ R_X
$$

is (the [[dependent type theory|dependent]] version of) the canonical [[categorical semantics|categorical interpretation]] of the [[exponential modality]] of [[linear logic]]. See at _[dependent linear type theory --  The canonical co-modality](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+linear+type+theory#TheCanonicalComodality)_ for more.

### The comprehensive factorization system

If the extension functors $E_X \to B/X$ are [[fully faithful]], then together they make $E$ into a 'fibrewise [[reflective subcategory|reflective]]' subfibration of the codomain fibration of $B$, which is a reflective subfibration if the image functors preserve pullbacks.  (See [[stable factorization system]].)

Call a morphism of the form $\{P\} \to X$ a _subtype inclusion_.  Every morphism $t \colon Y \to X$ of $B$ factors through one such by means of the unit $\eta_t$ of the adjunction $im \dashv \{-\}$:
$$
\array{
  Y & & \overset{\eta_t}{\to} & & \{ im t \} \\
  & \mathllap{t}\searrow & & \swarrow\mathrlap{i_t} & \\
  & & X & &
}
$$
This gives rise to an [[orthogonal factorization system]] precisely when each $\eta_t$ is [[orthogonal]] to all subtype inclusions.
It is shown by [(Carboni et. al., section 2.12)](#Carboni97) that this holds if and only if subtype inclusions are closed under composition.

For the subobject fibration of a regular category, this gives the usual ([[regular epimorphism|regular epi]], [[monomorphism|mono]]) factorization system, while for the fibration of presheaves over $Cat$ it gives the factorization of a functor into a [[final functor]] followed by a [[discrete fibration]].  (See also [[michaelshulman:comprehensive factorization]] for a description of the latter as a [[factorization system in a 2-category]].)


## Axiom or axiom scheme?

Although usually presented as an axiom scheme, in many cases, all instances of separation follow from finitely many special cases (which can then be packaged into a single axiom, using [[and|conjunction]], although this is probably pointless).  This is the case, for example, in [[ETCS]] (a structural set theory that satisfied bounded separation) and [[NBG]] (a material class theory that satisfies full separation).  In [[type theory|type-theoretic]] foundations of mathematics, separation is usually invisible, but again some form (generally only bounded) can again be proved from a few specific axioms or constructions.


## Relation to the axiom of replacement

Full separation follows from the [[axiom of replacement]] and the principle of [[excluded middle]] (along with the axiom of the [[empty set]]).  Therefore, the axiom is often left out entirely of a description of [[ZFC]] (the usually accepted foundation of mathematics).  In versions of set theory for [[constructive mathematics]], however, we often have replacement but only bounded or limited separation, and in any case separation must be listed explicitly.
