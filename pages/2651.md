## Idea ##

Given a finite [[n-poset]] $C$, its _Hasse n-graph_ encodes the minimal amount of information necessary to reproduce the ordering relation.

## Definition ##

Given an [[n-poset]] $C$, a **Hasse $n$-graph** $H$ is a [[directed n-graph]] whose [[Hasse quiver]] $F(H)$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to $C$.

As with [[Hasse diagram]], I *think* that declaring it to be smallest in unnecessary; the fact that it is merely an $n$-graph and not a $n$-category will do this.  But this should be an $n$-quiver, yes?  ---Toby

[[Eric]]: What should be an n-quiver? I thought I'd stick the "smallest" in there because if $x\lt y$, $y\lt z$ then the morphisms $x\to y$, $y\to z$, and $x\to z$ are in the quiver, but only $x\to y$ and $y\to z$ need to be in the Hasse diagram. However, we could have a graph including $x\to z$, but this would not be a Hasse diagram. Maybe I'm confused.

_Toby_:  It would not be a Hasse diagram, but also its quiver would not be a poset, so that\'s taken care of.

However, right now you\'ve got it that a Hasse $1$-quiver is the free *poset* on a $1$-digraph instead of the free *category*, so now it is no longer taken care of.  (The free category on $\{x,y,z|x \to y, x \to z, y \to z\}$ has a noncommuting triangle, but the free poset on it is just the only poset $\{x \leq y \leq z\}$.)  One cool thing about the definition at [[Hasse diagram]], in my mind, was that you *didn\'t* have to specify 'smallest'; it was unique if it existed.  Can we get that in higher dimensions?
