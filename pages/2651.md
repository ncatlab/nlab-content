## Idea ##

Given a finite [[n-poset]] $C$, its _Hasse n-graph_ encodes the minimal amount of information necessary to reproduce the ordering relation.

## Definition ##

Given an [[n-poset]] $C$, a **Hasse $n$-graph** $H$ is the smallest [[directed n-graph]] whose [[quiver]] $F(H)$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to $C$.
