A __linear category__ is an [[additive category]] that is [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Vect]].

This can also be called an [[algebroid]], being the [[horizontal categorification]] of [[associative algebra]].

As [[Vect]] is really $Vect_K$ for some [[field]] $K$, a linear category is really $K$-linear (or linear over $K$) for some field $K$.  We can also make $K$ a [[commutative ring]] without much trouble; then a linear category over the ring of [[integer]]s is the same thing as an [[additive category]].
