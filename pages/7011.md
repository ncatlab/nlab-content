At an Oberwolfach workshop in 2011 on [[homotopy type theory]], [[Andrej Bauer]] and [[Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine]] created a tutorial that walks the reader through the proof that the [[univalence axiom]] implies [[functional extensionality]], formalized entirely in [[Coq]]-proof assistant code.

For a pdf-version of the tutorial see

* [[Andrej Bauer]], [[Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine]], _A Coq proof that Univalence Axioms implies Functional Extensionality_ (2011) ([[BauerLumsdaineUnivalence.pdf:file]]).

In order to follow the proof explicitly in [[Coq]]-itself, download the accompanying source files here:

* [https://github.com/andrejbauer/Homotopy/tree/master/OberwolfachTutorial](https://github.com/andrejbauer/Homotopy/tree/master/OberwolfachTutorial)

and feed them into your [[Coq]]. See the README file there for further hints.
