## Definition

In the context of [[geometric quantization]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$ equipped with a choice of [[prequantum line bundle]] $(E,\nabla)$, a [[Lagrangian submanifold]] $Q \hookrightarrow X$ of a [[symplectic manifold]] is called a _Bohr-Sommerfeld leaf_ if the prequantum [[circle bundle]] $E|_Q$ restricted to $Q$ has not only vanishing [[curvature]] but is also trivializable as a [[circle bundle]]. Such a trivializaton as a circle bundle with connection is given by a [[covariant derivative|covariantly constant]] non-vanishing [[section]] of the [[associated bundle|associated]] [[line bundle]]. 

## Examples

### Harmonic oscillator
 {#HarmonicOscillator}

For the single 1-dimensional [[Harmonic oscillator]], [[phase space]] is the [[symplectic manifold]] $\mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with the symplectic form

$$
  \omega = d_{dR} t \wedge d\theta
  \,,
$$

where on $\mathbb{R}^2- \mathbb{R}_+$ $(t, \theta)$ are the canonical [[polar coordinates]].

We may choose the trivial [[prequantum line bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] given by the globally defined [[differential form|differential 1-form]]

$$
  \Theta := t \wedge d\theta
  \,.
$$

Then a [[polarization]] is given by the [[foliation]] whose [[leaves]] are the [[submanifolds]] of constant $t$.

The [[covariant derivative]] along any leaf acts as

$$
  (\nabla_\Theta \sigma)(t, \theta) 
  = (\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \sigma)(t, \theta)
  - i t \sigma(t, \theta)
 \,.
$$

The covariantly sections covariantly constat on a leaf hence must be of the form

$$
  \sigma(t, \theta) = a(t) \exp( i t \theta)
  \,.
$$

For this to be well-defined as a globally defined section on the whole leaf the condition

$$
  t = 2 \pi k \; \; k \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

has to hold. Hence the Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves here are the [[circles]] of radius $2 \pi k$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

###### Theorem
**(Guillemin-Sternberg)**

If a [[polarization]] of $X$ is a [[regular fibration]] with [[compact space|compact]] [[leaves]] over a [[simply connected]] base $B$, then the Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves form a discrete subset given by 

$$
  \{F_BS\} = \{
    p \in X | (f_1(p), \cdots, f_n(p)) \in \mathbb{Z}^n
  \}
$$

where the $\{f_i\}$ are global [[action coordinates]] on the base space $B$.

###### Theorem
**(Sniatycki)**

If the leaf space $B$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and the projection $X \to B$ has [[compact space|compact]] fibers, then the [[dimension]] of the [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|space of quantum states]] is given by the number of Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves.
