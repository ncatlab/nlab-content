
##Idea##


The simplest cases of Chu spaces can be thought of simply  as matrices over a set $\Sigma$, that is, a rectangular array whose 
entries are drawn from $\Sigma$. The case most usually considered is $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, and special cases of this then correspond to many relational structures. In fact, such a 'dyadic' Chu space is just another way of representing a relation from the set of labels for the rows, to that of the label of columns of the matrix.

###Note
 
The definition we will give here is just an ultra-special case of that given in [[Chu construction]].

##Definition

A _(dyadic or two valued) Chu space_ $\mathcal{P}$ is a triple $(P_o, \models_P, P_a)$, where $P_o$ is a set of _objects_, and $P_a$ is a set of _attributes_.  The _satisfaction_ relation $\models_P$ is a subset of $P_o\times P_a$.


The terminology used here is motivated by the link with [[formal concept analysis]].  Alternative terminologies include (from Pratt's [Coimbra notes](http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/coimbra.pdf)) $P_o$ is a set of  *points* constituting the *carrier*, whilst $P_a$ is the set of *states*, which  constitutes the *cocarrier*.
