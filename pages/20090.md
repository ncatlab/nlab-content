## Idea

A _complex surface_ is a _[[surface]]_ in [[complex analytic geometry]], hence a [[complex analytic space]] of complex [[dimension]] 2 (hence of real dimension 4).

## Examples

* [[K3 surface]]

## Related concepts

* [[algebraic surface]]

* [[complex manifold]], [[almost complex manifold]]
