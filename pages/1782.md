## Idea


Algebraic K-theory is about natural constructions of [[cohomology theories]]/[[spectra]] from [[algebra|algebraic]] data such as [[commutative rings]], [[symmetric monoidal categories]] and various [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] refinements of these. 

From a modern perspective, the algebraic K-theory [[spectrum]] $\mathbf{K}(R)$ of a [[commutative ring]] is simply the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal category|∞-group completion]] of [[algebraic vector bundles]] on $Spec(R)$, this will be discussed in more detail [below](#AsTheKTheoryOfAlgebraicVectorBundles). In particular there is a natural concept of algebraic K-theory of "[[brave new rings]]" ([[ring spectra]], [[E-∞ rings]])

Historically, the _algebraic K-theory_ of a [[commutative ring]] $R$ (what today is the "0th" algebraic K-theory group) was originally defined to be the [[Grothendieck group]] of its [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[projective modules]] (under [[tensor product]] of modules). Under the [relation between modules and vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction), this is directly analogous to the basic definition of [[topological K-theory]] and hence the common term. (In fact when applied to the _[[stack]]_ of [[vector bundles]] then algebraic K-theory subsumes [[topological K-theory]] and also [[differential K-theory]], see [below](#OnMonoidalStacks)).

There are canonical maps $K_0(R)\to Pic(R)$ from the 0th algebraic K-theory of a ring to its [[Picard group]] and $K_1(R)\to GL_1(R)$ from the first algebraic K-theory group of $R$ to its [[group of units]] which are given in components by the [[determinant]] functor. This fact is sometimes used to motivate algebraic K-theory as a "generalization of [[linear algebra]]" (see e.g. [this MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/a/171369/381)). This is also how the traditional [[regulator of a number field]] relates to [[Beilinson regulators]] of algebraic K-theory.

More generally, following the axiomatics of _[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]_ any _algebraic K-theory_ should be given by a sequence of [[functors]] $K_i$ from some suitable class of [[categories]] of "algebraic nature" to [[abelian groups]], satisfying some natural conditions. Moreover, following the [[Brown representability theorem]] these groups should arise as the [[homotopy groups]] of a [[spectrum]], the algebraic _[[K-theory spectrum]]_. Classical constructions producing this by combinatorial means are known as the _[[Quillen Q-construction]]_ defined on _[[Quillen exact categories]]_ and more generally the _[[Waldhausen S-construction]]_ defined on _[[Waldhausen categories]]_.

For more on the history of the subject see ([Arlettaz 04](#Arlettaz04), [Grayson 13](#Grayson13)) and see at at _[[Algebraic K-theory, a historical perspective]]_.

There are two ways to think of the traditional algebraic K-theory of a commutative ring more conceptually: on the one hand this construction is the [[group completion]] of the [[direct sum]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]]-structure on the [[category of modules]], on the other hand it is the group completion of the addition operation expressed by [[short exact sequences]] in that category. This leads to the two modern ways of expressing and viewing algebraic K-theory:

1. **monoidal.** The [[core]] of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] or more generally of a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] has a [[universal construction|universal]] completion to an [[abelian ∞-group]]/[[connective spectrum]] optained by universally adjoining [[inverses]] to the symmetric monoidal operation -- the [[∞-group completion]]. This yields the concept of [[K-theory of a permutative category|algebraic K-theory of a symmetric monoidal category]] and more generally that of [[algebraic K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]];

1. **exact/stable.** Analogously, inverting the addition operation expressed by the [[exact sequences]] in an [[abelian category]] or more generally in a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] yields the [[algebraic K-theory of a stable (∞,1)-category]]. Explicit ways to express this are known as the  _[[Quillen Q-construction]]_ and the _[[Waldhausen S-construction]]_. This turns out to be a universal construction in the context of [[non-commutative motives]].

Here the second construction may be understood as first [[split exact sequence|splitting]] the [[exact sequences]] and then applying the first construction to the resulting [[direct sum]] monoidal structure. Typically the first construction here contains more information but is harder to compute, and vice versa (see also MO-discussion [here](http://mathoverflow.net/a/98602/381) and [here](http://mathoverflow.net/a/102583/381)).


Both of these constructions produce a [[spectrum]] (hence [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]]) -- called the _[[K-theory spectrum]]_ -- and the algebraic K-theory groups are the [[homotopy groups]] of that spectrum.



The classical case of the algebraic K-theory of a commutative ring $R$ is a special case of this general concept of algebraic K-theory by either forming the [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(Mod(R), \oplus)$ and applying the [[abelian ∞-group]]-completion to that, or else forming the [[stable (∞,1)-category of chain complexes]] of $R$-modules and applyong the [[Waldhausen S-construction]] to that. In both cases the result is a [[spectrum]] whose degree-0 [[homotopy group]] is the ordinary algebraic K-theory of $R$ as given by the [[Grothendieck group]] and whose higher homotopy groups are its _higher algebraic K-theory_ groups.

### As the K-theory of algebraic vector bundles
 {#AsTheKTheoryOfAlgebraicVectorBundles}

Regard the [[stack]] $\mathbf{Vect}^\oplus$ of [[algebraic vector bundles]]
on the gros [[Zariski site]] as taking values in [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]], via the [[direct sum]] of vector bundles. Then applying the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]-construction $\mathcal{K}$ to this yields a [[sheaf of spectra]], in fact of [[E-∞ rings]]

$$
  \mathbf{K} \coloneqq \mathcal{K}(\mathbf{Vect}^\oplus)
  \in CRing(Stab(Sh_\infty(ArithmeticSchemes)))
  \,.
$$

This is the higher algebraic K-theory spectrum, in that for $X$ a [[scheme]], then the [[homotopy groups]] of $\mathbf{K}(X)$ are the higher algebraic K-theory groups of the scheme $X$

$$
  K(X)^\bullet = \pi_{-\bullet}(\mathbf{K}(X))
  \,.
$$

In this form this is due to ([Bunke-Tamme 12, section 3.3](#BunkeTamme12), [Bunke-Tamme 13, section 2.4](#BunkeTamme13)). This is based on ([Weibel, IV.4.8, IV.4.11.1](#Weibel)) which characterizes algebraic K-theory via group completion of projective modules, and on ([Thomason-Trobaugh 90](#ThomasonTrobaugh90)) which shows that the resulting K-theory presheaf satisfies [[descent]] on the [[Zariski site]] (see [below](#Descent)). See ([Nikolaus 13, section 6](K-theory+of+a+symmetric+monoidal+%28∞%2C1%29-category#Nikolaus13)) for details on the relation between abstract $\infty$-group completion and traditional constructions.

For more on this see at _[[differential algebraic K-theory]]_ .

### Via stable $(\infty,1)$-categories

There is a universal characterization of the construction of the K-theory spectrum $K(A)$ of a stable $(\infty,1)$-category $A$:

there is an $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  U : (\infty,1)StabCat \to N
$$

to a stable $(\infty,1)$-category which is universal with the property that it respects colimits and exact sequences in a suitable way. Given any stable $(\infty,1)$-category $A$, its (connective or non-connective, depending on details) algebraic K-theory spectrum is the hom-object

$$
  K(A) \simeq Hom(U(Sp), U(A))
  \,,
$$

where $Sp$ denotes the stable $(\infty,1)$-category of compact [[spectra]].

## Properties

### Chern characters

#### Regulators and relation to ordinary cohomology

See at _[[Beilinson regulator]]_.


#### Cyclotomic trace and relation to topological Hochschild homology

Given a ring $R$, then there is a natural morphism of [[spectra]]

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{TC}(R)
     \\
      & \nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{K}(R) &\longrightarrow& \mathbf{THH}(R)
  }
$$

from the algebraic K-theory spectrum to the [[topological Hochschild homology]] spectrum and factoring through the [[topological cyclic homology]] spectrum called the _[[cyclotomic trace]]_ which much like a [[Chern character]] map for algebraic K-theory.

### Comparison map and Relation to topological K-theory

### Descent
 {#Descent}

The algebraic K-theory spectrum $\mathbf{K}$ satisfies [[descent]] to give a [[sheaf]] of [[connective spectra]] on the [[Zariski site]].  For regular noetherian schemes this statement is due to ([Brown Gersten 73](#BrownGersten73)). The generalization to finite dimensional noetherian schemes is due to ([Thomason-Trobaugh 90](#ThomasonTrobaugh90)).

Moreover, $\mathbf{K}$ satisfies descent with respect to the [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich topology]] (which lies between Zariski and étale).  This is due to ([Nisnevich 89](#Nisnevich89)) and was generalized in turn to finite dimensional noetherian schemes in the same paper of Thomason.

Further generalization of the descent result to finite dimensional quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes is due to ([Rosenschon 06](#Rosenschon06)).

The question of descent of $\mathbf{K}$ over the [[étale site]] is closely related to the [[Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture]], see also ([Thomason 85](#Thomason85)).  This is now a theorem of Rost and Voevodsky and it implies that K-theory does satisfy etale descent in sufficient large degrees.

## Examples

### On monoidal stacks
 {#OnMonoidalStacks}

Algebraic K-theory is traditionally applied to single [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories|symmetric monoidal]]/[[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]] [[(∞,1)-categories]], but to the extent that it is [[(∞,1)-functor|functorial]] it may just as well be applied to [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] with values in these.

Notably, applied to the monoidal [[stack]] of [[vector bundles]] (with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]) on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]], the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|K-theory of a monoidal category]]-functor produces a [[sheaf of spectra]] which is a form of [[differential K-theory]] and whose [[geometric realization]] is the [[topological K-theory]] spectrum.
