## Idea


Algebraic K-theory is about natural constructions of [[cohomology theories]]/[[spectra]] from [[algebra|algebraic]] data such as [[commutative rings]], [[symmetric monoidal categories]] and various [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] refinements of these. 

From a modern perspective, the algebraic K-theory [[spectrum]] $\mathbf{K}(R)$ of a [[commutative ring]] is simply the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal category|∞-group completion]] of [[algebraic vector bundles]] on $Spec(R)$; this will be discussed in more detail [below](#AsTheKTheoryOfAlgebraicVectorBundles). In particular there is a natural concept of algebraic K-theory of "[[brave new rings]]", i.e. of [[ring spectra]]/[[E-∞ rings]].

Historically, the _algebraic K-theory_ of a [[commutative ring]] $R$ (what today is the "0th" algebraic K-theory group) was originally defined to be the [[Grothendieck group]] of its [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[projective modules]] (under [[tensor product]] of modules). Under the [relation between modules and vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction), this is directly analogous to the basic definition of [[topological K-theory]] and hence the common term. (In fact when applied to the _[[stack]]_ of [[vector bundles]] then algebraic K-theory subsumes [[topological K-theory]] and also [[differential K-theory]], see [below](#OnMonoidalStacks)).

There are canonical maps $K_0(R)\to Pic(R)$ from the 0th algebraic K-theory of a ring to its [[Picard group]] and $K_1(R)\to GL_1(R)$ from the first algebraic K-theory group of $R$ to its [[group of units]] which are given in components by the [[determinant]] functor. This fact is sometimes used to motivate algebraic K-theory as a "generalization of [[linear algebra]]" (see e.g. [this MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/a/171369/381)). This is also how the traditional [[regulator of a number field]] relates to [[Beilinson regulators]] of algebraic K-theory.

More generally, following the axiomatics of _[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]_ any _algebraic K-theory_ should be given by a sequence of [[functors]] $K_i$ from some suitable class of [[categories]] of "algebraic nature" to [[abelian groups]], satisfying some natural conditions. Moreover, following the [[Brown representability theorem]] these groups should arise as the [[homotopy groups]] of a [[spectrum]], the algebraic _[[K-theory spectrum]]_. Classical constructions producing this by combinatorial means are known as the _[[Quillen Q-construction]]_ defined on _[[Quillen exact categories]]_ and more generally the _[[Waldhausen S-construction]]_ defined on _[[Waldhausen categories]]_.

For more on the history of the subject see ([Arlettaz 04](#Arlettaz04), [Grayson 13](#Grayson13)) and see at at _[[Algebraic K-theory, a historical perspective]]_.

There are two ways to think of the traditional algebraic K-theory of a commutative ring more conceptually: on the one hand this construction is the [[group completion]] of the [[direct sum]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]]-structure on the [[category of modules]], on the other hand it is the group completion of the addition operation expressed by [[short exact sequences]] in that category. This leads to the two modern ways of expressing and viewing algebraic K-theory:

1. **monoidal.** The [[core]] of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] or more generally of a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] has a [[universal construction|universal]] completion to an [[abelian ∞-group]]/[[connective spectrum]] optained by universally adjoining [[inverses]] to the symmetric monoidal operation -- the [[∞-group completion]]. This yields the concept of [[K-theory of a permutative category|algebraic K-theory of a symmetric monoidal category]] and more generally that of [[algebraic K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]];

1. **exact/stable.** Analogously, inverting the addition operation expressed by the [[exact sequences]] in an [[abelian category]] or more generally in a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] yields the [[algebraic K-theory of a stable (∞,1)-category]]. Explicit ways to express this are known as the  _[[Quillen Q-construction]]_ and the _[[Waldhausen S-construction]]_. This turns out to be a universal construction in the context of [[non-commutative motives]].

Here the second construction may be understood as first [[split exact sequence|splitting]] the [[exact sequences]] and then applying the first construction to the resulting [[direct sum]] monoidal structure. Typically the first construction here contains more information but is harder to compute, and vice versa (see also MO-discussion [here](http://mathoverflow.net/a/98602/381) and [here](http://mathoverflow.net/a/102583/381)).


Both of these constructions produce a [[spectrum]] (hence [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]]) -- called the _[[K-theory spectrum]]_ -- and the algebraic K-theory groups are the [[homotopy groups]] of that spectrum.



The classical case of the algebraic K-theory of a commutative ring $R$ is a special case of this general concept of algebraic K-theory by either forming the [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(Mod(R), \oplus)$ and applying the [[abelian ∞-group]]-completion to that, or else forming the [[stable (∞,1)-category of chain complexes]] of $R$-modules and applyong the [[Waldhausen S-construction]] to that. In both cases the result is a [[spectrum]] whose degree-0 [[homotopy group]] is the ordinary algebraic K-theory of $R$ as given by the [[Grothendieck group]] and whose higher homotopy groups are its _higher algebraic K-theory_ groups.





## Constructions

### Symmetric monoidal K-theory

For a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $C$, K-theory may be defined by taking

* the [[maximal subgroupoid]] $i C \subset C$,
* the [[classifying space]] $B(i C)$ (a [[topological monoid]]),
* the [[group completion]] $\Omega B B (i C)$.

See at

* [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]

* [[K-theory of a permutative category]]

* [[K-theory of a bipermutative category]]

### Quillen Q-construction (for exact categories)

Given an [[exact category]] $E$, one defines $K(E)$ by applying

* the [[Quillen Q-construction]] $Q(E)$,
* the [[group completion]] $\Omega B Q(E)$.

See at 

* [[Quillen Q-construction]]

### Waldhausen $S_\bullet$-construction (for Waldhausen categories)

Given a [[Waldhausen category]] $(C, w C)$, one defines its $K$-theory by applying

* the [[Waldhausen S-construction]] $w S_\bullet C$ (a [[simplicial category]]),
* the [[nerve]] (a [[bisimplicial set]]),
* the [[colimit]] (a [[simplicial set]]),
* the [[geometric realization]] (a [[space]]).

There is also a [[Waldhausen S-construction]] for [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]] and, most generally, for [[Waldhausen (infinity,1)-categories]].

See at

* [[Waldhausen S-construction]]
* [[K-theory of a stable (infinity,1)-category]]

## Examples

### For rings

We recall several constructions of the [[algebraic K-theory]] of a [[ring]].
See ([Weibel, IV.4.8, IV.4.11.1](#Weibel)) for details.


#### Plus construction

Given an associative unital [[ring]] $R$, one may define the algebraic K-theory [[space]] $K(R) = BGL(R)^+$ by taking

* the [[general linear groups]] $GL_n(R)$ for $n \ge 0$,
* their [[classifying spaces]],
* the [[colimit]] $BGL(R) = colim_n BGL_n(R)$,
* the [[Quillen plus construction]].

#### Direct sum K-theory

Consider the category $P(X)$ of [[finitely generated]] [[projective]] (right) $R$-modules.
It has a [[symmetric monoidal structure]] given by [[direct sum]].
The algebraic K-theory $K(R)$ may be described as the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] of $P(R)$.
That is, it is the [[group completion]]
  $K(R) = \Omega B B (i P(X))$
where $i P(X)$ denotes the [[maximal subgroupoid]].
See ([Weibel, IV.4.8, IV.4.11.1](#Weibel)).

#### Exact K-theory

Consider the category $P(X)$ of [[finitely generated]] [[projective module|projective]] (right) $R$-modules.
This is an [[exact category]] and the K-theory $K(R)$ may be described via the [[Quillen Q-construction]]:
  $$ K(R) = \Omega B (Q(P(R)). $$


### For schemes

For [[schemes]], there are two constructions which do not agree in full generality.
See [Thomason-Trobaugh 90](#ThomasonTrobaugh90).

#### Quillen K-theory

The Quillen K-theory of a [[scheme]] $X$ is defined as the algebraic K-theory of the [[exact category]] $Vect(X)$ of [[vector bundles]] on $X$ (using the [[Quillen Q-construction]]).

#### Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory

Let $Perf(X)$ be the category of [[perfect complexes]] on $X$.
This admits the structure of a [[Waldhausen category]], and the Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory of $X$ is defined via the [[Waldhausen S-construction]].

It may also be defined as the [[K-theory of a stable (infinity,1)-category]] of $Perf(X)$ viewed as a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]].

Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory coincides with Quillen K-theory for schemes that admit an ample family of [[line bundles]], but has the advantage of better global descent properties.

### For smooth manifolds

Discussion of algebraic K-theory as a [[smooth spectrum]] $SmoothMfd^{op} \longrightarrow Spectra$ via $X \mapsto K(C^\infty(X))$ is in ([Bunke-Nikolaus-Voelkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13), [Bunke 14](#Bunke14)).

For more on this see at 

* [[algebraic K-theory of smooth manifolds]]

* [[differential cohomology hexagon]], section _[Algebraic K-theory of smooth manifolds and the e-invariant](differential+cohomology+diagram#SoothVectorBundlesWithConnectionAndEInvariant)_

## Properties

### Chern characters

#### Regulators and relation to ordinary cohomology

See at _[[Beilinson regulator]]_.


#### Cyclotomic trace and relation to topological Hochschild homology

Given a ring $R$, then there is a natural morphism of [[spectra]]

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{TC}(R)
     \\
      & \nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{K}(R) &\longrightarrow& \mathbf{THH}(R)
  }
$$

from the algebraic K-theory spectrum to the [[topological Hochschild homology]] spectrum and factoring through the [[topological cyclic homology]] spectrum called the _[[cyclotomic trace]]_ which much like a [[Chern character]] map for algebraic K-theory.

### Comparison map and Relation to topological K-theory

* [[comparison map between algebraic and topological K-theory]]



### Descent
 {#Descent}

#### Zariski and Nisnevich descent

The algebraic K-theory spectrum $\mathbf{K}$ satisfies [[descent]] to give a [[sheaf]] of [[connective spectra]] on the [[Zariski site]].  For regular noetherian schemes this statement is due to ([Brown Gersten 73](#BrownGersten73)). The generalization to finite dimensional noetherian schemes is due to ([Thomason-Trobaugh 90](#ThomasonTrobaugh90)).

Moreover, $\mathbf{K}$ satisfies descent with respect to the [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich topology]] (which lies between Zariski and étale).  This is due to ([Nisnevich 89](#Nisnevich89)) and was generalized in turn to finite dimensional noetherian schemes in the same paper of Thomason.

Further generalization of the descent result to finite dimensional quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes is due to ([Rosenschon 06](#Rosenschon06)).

#### Etale descent

The question of descent of $\mathbf{K}$ over the [[étale site]] is closely related to the [[Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture]], see also ([Thomason 85](#Thomason85)).  This is now a theorem of Rost and Voevodsky and it implies that K-theory does satisfy etale descent in sufficient large degrees.

#### Description of the K-theory sheaf via algebraic vector bundles
 {#AsTheKTheoryOfAlgebraicVectorBundles}

Let $Sch$ denote the gros [[Zariski site]] of regular, separated, noetherian schemes.
It is explained in ([Bunke-Tamme 12, section 3.3](#BunkeTamme12) that the presheaf of [[spectra]] on $Sch$ defined by algebraic K-theory admits the following description.

Regard the [[stack]] $\mathbf{Vect}^\oplus$ of [[algebraic vector bundles]]
on $Sch$ as taking values in [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]], via the [[direct sum]] of vector bundles. Then apply the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]-construction $\mathcal{K}$ to this, yielding a [[sheaf of spectra]].
This identifies with the usual Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory sheaf,a fact that follows from

1. Zariski descent for Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory,

1. the Zariski-local equivalence between Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory, Quillen K-theory, and direct sum K-theory.

## Examples

### On monoidal stacks
 {#OnMonoidalStacks}

Algebraic K-theory is traditionally applied to single [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories|symmetric monoidal]]/[[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]] [[(∞,1)-categories]], but to the extent that it is [[(∞,1)-functor|functorial]] it may just as well be applied to [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] with values in these.

Notably, applied to the monoidal [[stack]] of [[vector bundles]] (with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]) on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]], the [[K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|K-theory of a monoidal category]]-functor produces a [[sheaf of spectra]] which is a form of [[differential K-theory]] and whose [[geometric realization]] is the [[topological K-theory]] spectrum. For more on this see at _[differential cohomology hexagon -- Differential K-theory](differential%20cohomology%20diagram#DifferentialKTheory)_.
