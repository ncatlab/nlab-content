A [[subobject]] given by a [[monomorphism]] $i: S \to X$ is __complemented__ if it has a [[complement]]: a subobject $\tilde{i}: \tilde{S} \to X$ such that $S \cap \tilde{S}$ is the [[initial object]] and $S \cup \tilde{S} = X$.  Every subobject is complemented in a [[Boolean category]].

In [[constructive mathematics]], a complemented subobject in [[Set]] is called a [[decidable subset]]; in classical mathematics, every subset is decidable.  Indeed, the law of [[excluded middle]] may be taken to say precisely that every subset of the [[point]] is complemented.

More generally, if every subobject of the [[terminal object]] of a [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]] coherent category $C$ is complemented, then every subobject in $C$ is complemented.  More generally still, if every subobject of every object in a [[generator|generating set]] of $C$ is complemented, then every subobject is complemented.
