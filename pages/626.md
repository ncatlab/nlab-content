# String diagrams

## Overview

_String diagrams_ are a graphical calculus for expressing operations in a [[monoidal category]]. The idea is roughly to think of objects in a monoidal category as "strings" and a morphism from one tensor product to another as a node which the source strings enter and the target strings exit. Further structure on the monoidal category is encoded in geometrical properties on these strings. For instance

* putting strings next to each other denotes the monoidal product, and having no string at all denotes the unit;

* braiding strings over each other corresponds to &#8211; yes, the [[braided monoidal category|braiding]] (if any);

* bending strings around corresponds to dualities on [[dualizable object]]s (if any).

Many operations in monoidal categories that look rather unenlightening in symbols become very obvious in string diagram calculus, such as the [[trace]]: an output wire gets bent around and connects to an input.



## Variations

There are many additional structures on monoidal categories, or similar structures, which can usually be represented by encoding further geometric properties.  For instance:

* in monoidal categories which are _[[ribbon category|ribbon categories]]_ the strings from above behave as if they have a small transversal extension which makes them behave as ribbons. Accordingly, there is a _twist_ operation in the axioms of a ribbon category and graphically it corresponds to twisting the ribbons by 360 degrees.

* in a [[traced monoidal category]], the trace can be represented by bending an output string around to connect to an input, even though if the objects are not dualizable the individual "bends" do not represent anything.

* in monoidal categories which are _[[spherical category|spherical]]_ all strings behave as if drawn on a sphere.

* in a [[hypergraph category]], the string diagrams are labeled [[hypergraphs]].

* string diagrams can be extended to represent [[monoidal functors]] in several ways.  One nice way is described in [these slides](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mmccurdy/cms2010talk.pdf), and can also be done with "3D regions" as drawn [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/08/the_geometry_of_monoidal_fibra.html#c034428).

* there is also a string diagram calculus for [[bicategories]], which extends that for monoidal categories regarded as one-object bicategories.  Thus, the strings now represent 1-cells and the nodes 2-cells, leaving the two-dimensional planar regions cut out by the strings to represent the 0-cells.  This makes it manifest that in general, string diagram notation is _Poincar&#233; dual_ to the [[globe|globular]] notation: where one uses $d$-dimensional symbols, the other uses $(2-d)$-dimensional symbols.

* string diagrams for bicategories can be generalized to string diagrams for [[double categories]] and [[proarrow equipments]] by distinguishing between "vertical" and "horizontal" strings.

* Similarly, one can [[categorification|categorify]] this to "[[surface diagrams]]" for [[3-categories]] (including [[monoidal bicategories]]) and so on; see for instance [[toddtrimble:Surface diagrams|here]].

* As explained [here](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/the-operadic-periodic-table/), in the presence of certain levels of duality it may be better to work with diagrams on cylinders or spheres rather than in boxes. This relates to [[planar algebras]] and [[canopolis|canopolises]]. 

* A string diagram calculus for [[monoidal fibrations]] can be obtained as a generalization of C.S. Peirce's "existential graphs."  The ideas are essentially contained in ([Brady-Trimble 98](#BradyTrimble98)) and developed in ([Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12)), and was discussed [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/08/the_geometry_of_monoidal_fibra.html).

* String diagrams for [[closed monoidal categories]] (see also at _[[Kelly-Mac Lane graph]]_) are similar to those for [[autonomous categories]], but a bit subtler, involving "boxes" to separate parts of the diagram.  They were used informally by Baez and Stay [here](#BaezQG06) and [here](#Rosetta), but can also be done in essentially the same way as the [[proof nets]] used in [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[linear logic]]; see [Lamarche](#Lamarche08).

* Proof nets for [[classical mathematics|classical]] [[linear logic]] similarly give string diagrams for [[*-autonomous categories]], or more generally [[linearly distributive categories]]; see [Blute-Cockett-Seely-Trimble](#BCST).

 {#OriginalArticles}

[[Günter Hotz]] introduced "plane nets" (=string diagrams) and their categories in his 1965 habilitation thesis. This seems to be the first formal definition of string diagrams in the literature.

String diagrams appeared first in [[Max Kelly]] and Laplaza's paper on [[coherence theorem for monoidal categories|coherence for compact closed categories]]

Where in Kelly-Laplaza do string diagrams appear?  I can't find any picture of a string diagram in the paper.  Perhaps they are described somewhere in the text, but I can't see it.
