## Idea

_String diagrams_ (also _[[Penrose notation]]_ or _[[tensor networks]]_) constitute a graphical calculus for expressing operations in [[monoidal categories]]. The idea is roughly to think of [[objects]] in a monoidal category as "strings" and of [[morphisms]] from one [[tensor product]] to another as a node which the source strings enter and the target strings exit. Further structure on the monoidal category is encoded in geometrical properties on these strings. For instance

* putting strings next to each other denotes the monoidal product, and having no string at all denotes the unit;

* braiding strings over each other corresponds to &#8211; yes, the [[braided monoidal category|braiding]] (if any);

* bending strings around corresponds to dualities on [[dualizable object]]s (if any).

Many operations in monoidal categories that look rather unenlightening in symbols become very obvious in string diagram calculus, such as the [[trace]]: an output wire gets bent around and connects to an input.

String diagrams may be seen as dual (in the sense of [[Poincaré duality]]) to [[commutative diagrams]]. For instance, in a [[2-category]], an example of a string diagram for a [[2-morphism]] (shown on the left) is shown on the right here:

\begin{centre}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={node distance=1.5cm}]
\usetikzlibrary{calc,automata}

\node[above right of=a] (b) {$B$};

\node at ($(b) !.5! (c)$) (bc) {};

String diagrams for monoidal categories can be obtained in the same way, by considering a monoidal category as a 2-category with a single object.


## Variants

There are many additional structures on monoidal categories, or similar structures, which can usually be represented by encoding further geometric properties.  For instance:

* in monoidal categories which are _[[ribbon category|ribbon categories]]_ the strings from above behave as if they have a small transversal extension which makes them behave as ribbons. Accordingly, there is a _twist_ operation in the axioms of a ribbon category and graphically it corresponds to twisting the ribbons by 360 degrees.

* in a [[traced monoidal category]], the trace can be represented by bending an output string around to connect to an input, even though if the objects are not dualizable the individual "bends" do not represent anything.

* in monoidal categories which are _[[spherical category|spherical]]_ all strings behave as if drawn on a sphere.

* in a [[hypergraph category]], the string diagrams are labeled [[hypergraphs]].

* string diagrams can be extended to represent [[monoidal functors]] in several ways.  One nice way is described in [these slides](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mmccurdy/cms2010talk.pdf), and can also be done with "3D regions" as drawn [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/08/the_geometry_of_monoidal_fibra.html#c034428).

* there is also a string diagram calculus for [[bicategories]], which extends that for monoidal categories regarded as one-object bicategories.  Thus, the strings now represent 1-cells and the nodes 2-cells, leaving the two-dimensional planar regions cut out by the strings to represent the 0-cells.  This makes it manifest that in general, string diagram notation is _Poincar&#233; dual_ to the [[globe|globular]] notation: where one uses $d$-dimensional symbols, the other uses $(2-d)$-dimensional symbols.

* string diagrams for bicategories can be generalized to string diagrams for [[double categories]] and [[proarrow equipments]] by distinguishing between "vertical" and "horizontal" strings.

* Similarly, one can [[categorification|categorify]] this to "[[surface diagrams]]" for [[3-categories]] (including [[monoidal bicategories]]) and so on; see for instance [[toddtrimble:Surface diagrams|here]].

* As explained [here](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/the-operadic-periodic-table/), in the presence of certain levels of duality it may be better to work with diagrams on cylinders or spheres rather than in boxes. This relates to [[planar algebras]] and [[canopolis|canopolises]]. 

* A string diagram calculus for [[monoidal fibrations]] can be obtained as a generalization of C.S. Peirce's "existential graphs."  The ideas are essentially contained in ([Brady-Trimble 98](#BradyTrimble98)) and developed in ([Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12)), and was discussed [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/08/the_geometry_of_monoidal_fibra.html).

* String diagrams for [[closed monoidal categories]] (see also at _[[Kelly-Mac Lane graph]]_) are similar to those for [[autonomous categories]], but a bit subtler, involving "boxes" to separate parts of the diagram.  They were used informally by Baez and Stay [here](#BaezQG06) and [here](#Rosetta), but can also be done in essentially the same way as the [[proof nets]] used in [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[linear logic]]; see [Lamarche](#Lamarche08).

* Proof nets for [[classical mathematics|classical]] [[linear logic]] similarly give string diagrams for [[*-autonomous categories]], or more generally [[linearly distributive categories]]; see [Blute-Cockett-Seely-Trimble](#BCST).

### Original articles 
 {#OriginalArticles}

The development and use of string diagram calculus pre-dates its graphical appearance in print, due to the difficulty of printing non-text elements at the time.

> Many calculations in earlier works were quite clearly worked out with string diagrams, then painstakingly copied into equations. Sometimes, clearly graphical structures were described in some detail without actually being drawn: e.g. the construction of free compact closed categories in Kelly and Laplazas 1980 "Coherence for compact closed categories".

> ([Pawel Sobocinski, 2 May 2017](http://angg.twu.net/categories-2017may02.html#.1))

> This idea that string diagrams are, due to technical issues, only useful for private calculation, is said explicitly by Penrose. Penrose and Rindler's book "Spinors and Spacetime" (CUP 1984) has an 11-page appendix full of all sorts of beautiful, carefully hand-drawn graphical notation for tensors and various operations on them (e.g. anti-symmetrization and covariant derivative). On the second page, he says the following:

> "The notation has been found very useful in practice as it grealy simplifies the appearance of complicated tensor or spinor equations, the various interrelations expressed being discernable at a glance. Unfortunately the notation seems to be of value mainly for private calculations because it cannot be printed in the normal way."

Application of string diagrams to [[tensor]]-calculus in [[mathematical physics]] (hence for the case that the ambient [[monoidal category]] is that of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] equipped with the [[tensor product of vector spaces]]) was propagated by [[Roger Penrose]], whence [[physics|physicists]] know string diagrams as _Penrose notation for tensor calculus_:

Probably [[David Yetter]] was the first (at least in public) to write string diagrams  with "coupons" (a term used by [[Nicolai Reshitikhin]] and [[Turaev]] a few months later) to represent maps which are not inherent in the (braided or symmetric compact closed) monoidal structure.
