## Idea

A (binary) [[relation]] $\prec$ on a [[set]] $S$ is called _well-founded_ if it is valid to do [[induction]] on $\prec$ over $S$.


## Definition

Given a [[subset]] $A$ of $S$, suppose that $A$ has the property that, given any element $x$ of $S$, if
$$ \forall (t\colon S),\; t \prec x \Rightarrow t \in A ,$$
then $x \in A$.  Such an $A$ may be called a _$\prec$-inductive subset_ of $S$.  The relation $\prec$ is __well-founded__ if the only $\prec$-inductive subset of $S$ is $S$ itself.

Note that this is precisely what is necessary to validate induction over $\prec$: if we can show that a statement is true of $x\in S$ whenever it is true of everything $\prec$-below $x$, then it must be true of everything in $S$.  In the presence of [[excluded middle]] it is equivalent to other commonly stated definitions; see "alternative formulations" below.


## Examples

Let $S$ be a [[finite set]].  Then any relation on $S$ is well-founded.

Let $S$ be the set of [[natural numbers]], and let $x \prec y$ if $y$ is the [[successor]] of $x$: $y = x + 1$.  That this relation is well-founded is the usual principle of _mathematical induction_.

Again let $S$ be the set of natural numbers, but now let $x \prec y$ if $x \lt y$ in the usual order.  That this relation is well-founded is the principle of _strong induction_.

More generally, let $S$ be a set of [[ordinal numbers]] (or even the proper class of all ordinal numbers), and let $x \prec y$ if $x \lt y$ in the usual order.  That this relation is well-founded is the principle of _transfinite induction_.

Let $S$ be the set of [[integers]], and let $x \prec y$ mean that $x$ properly divides $y$: $y/x$ is an integer other than $\pm{1}$.  This relation is also well-founded, so one can prove properties of integers by induction on their proper divisors.


## Formulations in classical logic

While the definition above follows how a well-founded relation is generally *used* (namely, to prove properties of elements of $S$ by induction), it is complicated.  Two alternative formulations are given by the following lemmas:

1. The relation $\prec$ is well-founded if and only if there exists no infinite descending [[sequence]] $\cdots \prec x_2 \prec x_1 \prec x_0$.

2. The relation $\prec$ is well-founded if and only if every [[inhabited set|inhabited]] subset $A$ of $S$ has a member $x \in A$ such no $t \in A$ satisfies $t \prec x$.  (Such an $x$ is called a _$\prec$-minimal_ element of $A$.)

Lemma (1) is essentially Fermat\'s method of _infinite descent_.  Lemma (2) is traditionally used to state the [[axiom of foundation]], since then it may be expressed as a single axiom (rather than a schema) that doesn\'t rely on infinity (as infinite descent does).  Either may be seen in the literature as simpler than our definition above.

However, neither of these is acceptable in [[constructive mathematics]], since both lemmas require the principle of [[excluded middle]] to prove one direction.  The nonexistence of infinite descending sequences is too weak to allow proofs by induction (except for special forms of $A$), although it is sufficient to establish the [[Burali-Forti paradox]].  On the other hand, the requirement that every inhabited subset have a minimal element is too strong to ever be established (except for degenerate cases of $S$).  When necessary, we call a relation with the property of Lemma (2) **classically well-founded**.


## Coalgebraic formulation 

Many inductive or recursive notions may also be packaged in [[coalgebra|coalgebraic]] terms. For the concept of well-founded relation, first observe that a binary relation $\prec$ on a set $X$ is the same as a coalgebra structure $\theta\colon X \to P(X)$ for the covariant [[power-set]] endofunctor on $Set$, where $y \prec x$ if and only if $y \in \theta(x)$. 

In this language, a [[subset]] $i\colon U \hookrightarrow X$ is $\prec$-inductive, or $\theta$-inductive, if in the [[pullback]]

$$\array{
H & \stackrel{j}{\to} & X \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{\theta} \\
P U & \underset{P i}{\to} & P X
}$$ 

the map $j$ factors through $i$. (Note that $j$ is necessarily [[monomorphism|monic]], since $P$ preserves monos.) Unpacking this a bit: for any $x \in X$, if $\theta(x) = V$ belongs to $P U$, that is if $\theta(x) \subseteq U$, then $x \in U$. This says the same thing as $\forall_{x\colon X} (\forall_{y\colon X} y \prec x \Rightarrow y \in U) \Rightarrow x \in U$. 

Then, as usual, the $P$-coalgebra $(X, \theta)$ is well-founded if every $\theta$-inductive subset $U \hookrightarrow X$ is all of $X$. 

Other relevant notions may also be packaged; for example, the $P$-coalgebra $X$ is [[extensional relation|extensional]] if $\theta\colon X \to P X$ is monic. See also [[well-founded coalgebra]]. 


## Simulations

Given two sets $S$ and $T$, each equipped with a well-founded relation $\prec$, a [[function]] $f\colon S \to T$ is a __[[simulation]]__ of $S$ in $T$ if
1.  $f(x) \prec f(y)$ whenever $x \prec y$ and
2.  given $t \prec f(x)$, there exists $y \prec x$ with $t = f(y)$.

Then sets so equipped form a [[category]] with simulations as [[morphisms]].  See [[extensional relation]] for more uses of simulations.

In coalgebraic language, a simulation $S \to T$ is simply a $P$-coalgebra homomorphism $f\colon S \to T$. Condition (1), that $f$ is merely $\prec$-preserving, translates to the condition that $f$ is a [[colax morphism]] of coalgebras, in the sense that there is an inclusion 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{\theta_X}{\to} & P X \\
 ^\mathllap{f} \downarrow & \swArrow & \downarrow^\mathrlap{P f} \\
Y & \underset{\theta_Y}{\to} & P Y.
}$$ 


## Remarks

Every well-founded relation is [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]]; that is, $x \nprec x$.  Sometimes one wants a reflexive version $\preceq$ of a well-founded relation; let $x \preceq y$ if and only $x \prec y$ or $x = y$.  Then the requirement that $x$ be a minimal element of a subset $A$ states that $t \preceq x$ only if $t = x$.  But infinite descent or direct proof by induction still require $\prec$ rather than $\preceq$.

A [[well-order|well order]] may be defined as a well-founded [[linear order]], or alternatively as a [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[extensional relation|extensional]], well-founded relation.

The [[axiom of foundation]] in material [[set theory]] states precisely that the membership relation $\in$ on the proper class of all [[pure sets]] is well-founded.  In structural set theory, accordingly, one uses well-founded relations in building structural models of well-founded pure sets.
