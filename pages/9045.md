## Idea

A _Hodge structure_ (or _pure Hodge structure_, for emphasis) is a (bi-)[[graded object|grading]] structure on [[cohomology groups]] -- called a _Hodge decomposition_ -- of the kind that is exhibited by the [[de Rham cohomology]]/[[ordinary cohomology]] of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifolds]], according to the [[Hodge theorem]]. It is said to be _of weight $d$_ if it behaves like the cohomology of a Kähler manifold of [[dimension]] $d$.

A _mixed Hodge structure_ is a [[filtration]] on [[cohomology groups]] -- called a _Hodge filtration_ -- such that the [[associated graded object]] has pure Hodge structure of weight $k$ in each degree $k$. The archetypical example exhibiting this is the cohomology oc  [[complex varieties]] that have singularities ([Deligne 71](#Deligne74) [Deligne 74](#Deligne74)).

If instead of considering a single [[cohomology group]] one considers the cohomology groups of a parameterized collection of spaces -- hence the cohomology _[[sheaves]]/[[stacks]]_ -- then one speaks of _variation of Hodge structure_ (of a given weight).
