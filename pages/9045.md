### Pure Hodge structure

A _Hodge structure_ (or _pure Hodge structure_, for emphasis) is a (bi-)[[graded object|grading]] structure on [[cohomology groups]] -- called a _Hodge decomposition_ -- of the kind that is exhibited by the [[de Rham cohomology]]/complex-[[ordinary cohomology]] of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifolds]], according to the [[Hodge theorem]]. A Hodge structure is said to be _of weight $d$_ if it behaves like the cohomology of a Kähler manifold of [[dimension]] $d$.

If instead of considering a single [[cohomology group]] one considers the cohomology groups of a parameterized collection of spaces -- hence the cohomology _[[sheaves]]/[[stacks]]_ -- then one speaks of _variation of Hodge structure_ (of a given weight).

By a central theorem of Hodge theory (recalled as theorem \ref{HodgeFiltrationForComplexSpaceReproducesKaehlerHodgeStructure} below) the traditional (and original) [[filtered complex|filtration]] on the complex cohomology of a [[Kähler manifold]] induced by the [[harmonic differential forms]] generalizes to a [[filtered complex|filtration]] of the complex-valued [[ordinary cohomology]] of any [[complex analytic space]] which is simply given by the canonical degree-filtration of the [[holomorphic de Rham complex]].

This means that [[ordinary differential cohomology]] in the guise of [[Deligne cohomology]] is nothing but the [[homotopy pullback]] of a stage of the Hodge filtration along the " [[Chern character]] " map from integral to complex cohomology. (A point of view highlighted for instance in [Peters-Steenbrink 08, section 7.2](#PetersSteenbrink08)). Viewed this way Hodge structures are filtrations of stages of differential form cycle refinements of [[Chern characters]] that appear in the general definition/characterization of [[differential cohomology]], as discussed at  _[[differential cohomology hexagon]]_ starting around the section _[de Rham coefficients](differential+cohomology+diagram#DeRhamCoefficients)_

This modern point of view is also crucial for instance in the characterization of an [[intermediate Jacobian]] (see there) as the subgroup of [[Deligne cohomology]] that is in the [[kernel]] of the map to Hodge-filtering stage of ordinary cohomology. See at _[intermediate Jacobian -- characterization as Hodge-trivial Deligne cohomology](intermediate+Jacobian#CharacterizationAsHodgeTrivialDeligneCohomology)_.

### Mixed Hodge structure

A _mixed Hodge structure_ is a [[filtration]] on [[cohomology groups]] -- called a _[[Hodge filtration]]_ -- such that the [[associated graded object]] has pure Hodge structure of weight $k$ in each degree $k$. The archetypical example exhibiting this is the cohomology of  [[complex varieties]] that have singularities ([Deligne 71](#Deligne71) [Deligne 74](#Deligne74)).


## Definition

### For a Kähler manifold
 {#ForAKaehlerManifold}

Let $X$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifold]] and write $H^{p,q}(X)$ for its space of [[harmonic differential forms]], equivalently, via the [[Hodge isomorphism]], its [[Dolbeault cohomology]] in bidegree $(p,q)$.

Notice that by the [[de Rham theorem]] there are canonical maps

$$
  H^{p,q}(X)\to H^{p+q}(X,\mathbb{C})
$$

to [[ordinary cohomology]] of $X$ with complex [[coefficients]].

+-- {: .num_defn #TraditionalHodgeFiltration}
###### Definition

The _Hodge filtration_ in the cohomology of $X$ is the [[filtered complex]] structure given by the [[direct sum]]


$$
  F^p H^k(X, \mathbb{C})
   \coloneqq
  \underset{k-q \geq p}{\oplus}
  H^{k-q,q}(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The full Hodge filtration of degree-2 cohomology is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F^0 H^2(X,\mathbb{C})
    & =
    H^{0,2}(X) \oplus H^{1,1}(X) \oplus H^{2,0}(X)
    \\
    F^1 H^2(X,\mathbb{C})
    & =
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    H^{1,1}(X)
    \oplus
    H^{2,0}(X)
    \\
    F^2 H^2(X,\mathbb{C})
    & = 
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    H^{2,0}(X)
 \end{aligned}
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For all $p$ the mid-dimensional Hodge filtration stage in even total degree is

$$
  F^p H^{2p}
  = 
  H^{p,p}(X)
  \oplus
  H^{p+1,p-1}(X)
  \oplus 
  \cdots
  \oplus
  H^{2p,0}(X)
  \,.
$$

### For a complex analytic space
 {#ForAComplexAnalyticSpace}

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition


For $X$ a [[complex analytic space]], write 

$$
  \Omega^\bullet_X
  \coloneqq
  (\mathcal{O}_X \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^1_X \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^2(X) \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow} \cdots)
$$

for its [[holomorphic de Rham complex]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Notice the [relation to complex cohomology](holomorphic+de+Rham+complex#RelationToComplexCohomology) given by

$$
  H^k(X,\mathbb{C}) \simeq H^k(X,\Omega^\bullet_X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


The [[holomorphic de Rham complex]] is naturally [[filtered object|filtered]] by degree with the $p$th filtering stage being

$$
  F^p \Omega^\bullet_X
  \coloneqq
  (0 \to \cdots \to \Omega^p_X \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow}
   \Omega^{p+1} \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow} \cdots)
  \,.
$$

Notice that here $\Omega^p$ is still regarded as sitting in degree $-p$, one just replaces by 0 in the holomorphic de Rham complex the groups of differential forms of degree less than $p$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #HodgeFiltrationForComplexSpace}
###### Definition

The _Hodge filtration_ on $H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{C})$ is defined to be the [[filtration]] with $p$th stage the [[image]] of the [[hypercohomology|hyper]]-[[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in the $p$th filtering stage of the holomorphic de Rham complex inside that with coefficients the full de Rham complex:

$$
  F^p H^k(X,\mathbb{C})
  \coloneqq
  im
  \left(
    H^k(X, F^p \Omega^\bullet_X)
    \to 
    H^k(X, \Omega^\bullet_X)
  \right)
$$

###### Theorem

When the [[complex manifold]] $X$ happens to be a [[Kähler manifold]] then the [[Frölicher spectral sequence]]/[[Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence]]  gives that def. \ref{HodgeFiltrationForComplexSpace} coincides with the traditional definition via [[harmonic differential forms]], def. \ref{TraditionalHodgeFiltration}
