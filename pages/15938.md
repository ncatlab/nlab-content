## Idea

In [[formal logic]] one speaks of a "fragment" of [[theory]] when referring to just part of it. Specifically when rules of [[type formation]] or some of the [[natural deduction|inference rules]] are omitted, one retains a "fragment" of the original theory.

## Examples

By default [[linear logic]] has a wealth of [[conjunctions]]. Discarding or ignoring all of them except the [[multiplicative conjunction]] yield the fragment of _[[multiplicative linear logic]]_.
