In [[formal logic]] one speaks of a "fragment" of [[theory]] when referring to just part of it.

For instance by default [[linear logic]] has a wealth of [[conjunctions]]. Discarding or ignoring all of them except the [[multiplicative conjunction]] yield the fragment of _[[multiplicative linear logic]]_.
