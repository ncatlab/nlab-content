## Idea

In [[cosmology]] the [[radiation]] and [[matter]]-content of the [[observable universe]] may typically be approximated (in particular before any relevant [[structure formation]] has taken place and [[FRW models]] serve as a good approximation) by a [[dust]] or [[fluid]] which fills all of [[space]]. The [[proper time]] seen by a [[particle]] in this (possibly idealized or even hypothetical) [[dust]]/[[fluid]] is then called _comoving time_, i.e. the [[time]] as measured by an [[observer]] (i.e. along a [[lightlike]] curve in the [[spacetime]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]) whose motion is at rest with respect to the ambient dust/fluid.

Often the adjective "comoving" is suppressed when the context is assumed to be clear. For instance whenever any event in primordial cosmology (such as [[baryogenesis]], [[nucleosynthesis]], etc.) is said to occur at a given "time after the [[big bang]]", then what is meant is always comoving time.
