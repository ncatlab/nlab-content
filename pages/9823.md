Let $C$ be a [[category]] admitting finite [[fibred products]] and $f : X \to Y$ be a [[morphism]] over some base $S$.  The **graph morphism of $f$** is the [[morphism]] 

$$
  \Gamma_f \colon X \to X \times_S Y
$$ 

induced by $\mathbf{1}_X : X \to X$ and $f : X \to Y$.

The [[image]] of the graph morphism of $f$ is called the [[graph of a function|graph]] of $f$.
