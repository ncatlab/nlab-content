#Definition: Stacky Lie groupoid#

A _stacky Lie groupoid_ (in contrast to a [[Lie groupoid]]) is an [[internal category|internal groupoid]] in the category of [[differentiable stack|differentiable stacks]], such that the space of objects is an ordinary [[manifold]].

Notice that differentiable stacks are equivalent to Lie groupoids modulo [[homotopy theory|Morita equivalence]].

#Literature#

Stacky Lie groupoids and their [[Lie theory]] were introduced and studied by [Chenchang Zhu](http://chenchangzhu.blogspot.com/) and collaborators.
