## Idea 

What is called the _AKSZ formalism_ -- after the initials of its four authors -- Alexandrov, [[Maxim Kontsevich]], [[Albert Schwarz]], Oleg Zaboronsky -- is a technique for constructing [[action functional]]s in [[BV-BRST formalism]]  for [[sigma model]] [[quantum field theories]] whose 
[[target space]] is an [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$.

The [[action functional]] of AKSZ theory is that of [[∞-Chern-Simons theory]] induced from the [[Chern-Simons element]] that correspondonds to the [[invariant polynomial]] $\omega$. Details on this are at [∞-Chern-Simons theory -- Examples -- AKSZ theory](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory+--+examples#ASKZTheory).

## Examples

* to a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] corresponds the [[Poisson sigma-model]];

* the a [[Courant algebroid]] corresponds the [[Courant sigma-model]];

  in particular to a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] corresponds [[Chern-Simons theory]].

* [[BF-theory]]+[[topological Yang-Mills theory]], 


Als the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] topological 2d [[sigma-models]] are examples.


## Definition

A [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] is, roughly, one 

* whose fields are maps $\phi : \Sigma \to X$  to some space $X$;

* whose [[action functional]] is, apart from a 
  [[kinetic action|kinetic term]], the [[transgression]] 
  of some kind of [[cocycle]]  on $X$
  to the [[mapping space]] $\mathrm{Map}(\Sigma,X)$.

Here the terms "space", "maps" and "cocycles"
are to be made precise in a suitable context.
One says that $\Sigma$ is the _[[worldvolume]]_, 
$X$ is the _[[target space]]_ and the cocycle is
the _[[background gauge field]]_ .

For instance the ordinary charged [[particle]] 
(for instance an electron) is described by a $\sigma$-model 
where $\Sigma = (0,t) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the abstract
_[[worldline]]_, where $X$ is a smooth
([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]]
(for instance our [[spacetime]]) and where the background cocycle
is a [[circle bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] 
on $X$ (a degree-2 cocycle in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of $X$, representing a background _[[electromagnetic field]]_ : 
up to a kinetic term the action functional is the [[holonomy]] of the connection over  a given [[curve]] $\phi : \Sigma \to X$. 

The $\sigma$-models to be considered here are 
_higher_ generalizations of this example,
where the background gauge field is a cocycle of higher degree
(a [[connection on an infinity-bundle|higher bundle with connection]]) 
and where the worldvolume is
accordingly higher dimensional -- and where $X$ is allowed to be 
not just a manifold but an approximation to a 
_higher [[orbifold]] (a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]).

More precisely, here we take the [[category]] of [[space]]s
to be [[dg-geometry|smooth dg-manifolds]].
One may imagine that we can equip this 
with an [[internal hom]]
$\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X)$ given by $\mathbb{Z}$-graded objects. 
Given [[dg-geometry|dg-manifolds]] $\Sigma$ and $X$ 
their canonical degree-1 vector fields
$v_\Sigma$ and $v_X$ acting on the mapping space from the
left and right. In this sense their linear combination 
$v_\Sigma + k \, v_X$ for some $k \in \mathbb{R}$
equips also $\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X)$ with the structure of 
a differential graded smooth manifold.

Moreover, we take the "cocycle" on $X$ to be a 
graded [[symplectic structure]] $\omega$, 
and assume that there is a kind of Riemannian structure on $\Sigma$
that allows to form the [[transgression]]

$$
  \int_\Sigma \mathrm{ev}^* \omega
  :=
  p_! \mathrm{ev}^* \omega
$$

by [[integral transform|pull-push]] through the canonical 
[[correspondence]]

$$
  \mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X)
  \stackrel{p}{\leftarrow}
  \mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X) \times \Sigma
  \stackrel{ev}{\to}
   X
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[evaluation map]].

Assuming that one succeeds in making precise sense of all this 
one expects to 
find that $\int_\Sigma \mathrm{ev}^* \omega$ is in turn a symplectic 
structure on the mapping space. This implies that the vector field
$v_\Sigma + k\, v_X$ on mapping space has a 
[[Hamiltonian]] 
$\mathbf{S} \in C^\infty(\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X))$.
The grade-0 components $S_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}$ of $\mathbf{S}$ 
then constitute a functional on the space
of maps of graded manifolds $\Sigma \to X$. This is
the **AKSZ action functional** defining the AKSZ $\sigma$-model
with target space $X$ and background field/cocycle $\omega$.

In ([AKSZ](#AKSZ)) this procedure is indicated only somewhat vaguely. 
The focus of attention there is a discussion, from this perspective,
of the action functionals
of the 2-dimensional $\sigma$-models called the 
_[[A-model]]_ and the _[[B-model]]_ .

In ([Roytenberg](#Roytenberg)), a more detailed discussion of the general construction is given, including an explicit 

and general formula for $\mathbf{S}$ and hence for $S_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}$ . 
For $\{x^a\}$ a coordinate chart on $X$ that formula is
the following.

###### Definition

For $(X,\omega)$ a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid|symplectic dg-manifold]] of grade $n$, $\Sigma$ a smooth compact manifold of dimension $(n+1)$
and $k \in \mathbb{R}$, the
**AKSZ action functional**

$$
  S_{\mathrm{AKSZ},k} : 
   \mathrm{SmoothGrMfd}(\mathfrak{T}\Sigma, X)
  \to
  \mathbb{R}
$$

(where $\mathfrak{T}\Sigma$ is the shifted tangent bundle)

is

$$
  S_{\mathrm{AKSZ},k} 
   :
  \phi
  \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma 
  \left(
    \frac{1}{2}\omega_{ab} \phi^a \wedge d_{\mathrm{dR}}\phi^b
    + 
    k
    \,
    \phi^* \pi
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $\pi$ is the [[Hamiltonian]] for $v_X$ with respect to $\omega$
and where on the right we are interpreting fields as forms on $\Sigma$.

=--

This formula hence defines an infinite class of $\sigma$-models
depending on the target space structure $(X, \omega)$, and on the 
relative factor $k \in \mathbb{R}$.  In ([AKSZ](#AKSZ)) it was
already noticed that ordinary [[Chern-Simons theory]] is a special
case of this for $\omega$ of grade 2,  as is the 
[[Poisson sigma-model]]
for $\omega$ of grade 1 (and hence, as shown there, also the [[A-model]]
and the [[B-model]]). 
The main example in ([Roytenberg](#Roytenberg)) is spelling out the
general case for $\omega$ of grade 2, which is called the
_[[Courant sigma-model]]_ there. 

One nice aspect of this construction is that it follows immediately
that the full Hamiltonian $\mathbf{S}$ on mapping space satisfies
$\{\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{S}\} = 0$. Moreover, using the standard formula
for the internal hom of chain complexes one finds that the cohomology
of $(\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X), v_\Sigma + k v_X)$ in degree 0
is the space of functions on those fields that satisfy the 
[[Euler-Lagrange equations]] of $S_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}$. 
Taken together this implies that 
$\mathbf{S}$ is a solution of the "master equation"
of a [[BV-BRST complex]] for the quantum field theory
defined by $S_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}$. This is a crucial ingredient for the 
quantization of the model, and this is what the AKSZ construction
is mostly used for in the literature.
