## Idea

Where [[D-brane charge]] is the [[charge]] in [[K-theory]] carried by [[D-branes]] and computed as the [[partition function]]/[[index]] of the "[[superparticles]]" on the D-brane being the [[boundary field theory]] of the [[open string|open]] [[superstring]] ending on them, so open [[M2-branes]] ending on [[M5-branes]] should induced a charge given by the [[partition function]] of their bounding [[self-dual strings]] ("M-strings"), which is now an [[elliptic genus]]. Hence _M5-brane charge_ should be in [[elliptic cohomology]] ([Sati 10](#Sati10)).

## References

That the [[elliptic genus]] of the [[self-dual string]] on the [[M5-brane]] should be the M5-brane charge in [[elliptic cohomology]] in higher analogy to [[D-brane charge]] in [[K-theory]] is due to
