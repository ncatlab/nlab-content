## Definition

For $(A,d)$ a [[differential algebra]], a _differential idea_ is an [[ideal]] $I \subset A$ in the underlying [[associative algebra]] $A$ which is preserved by the [[derivation]] $d$, in that $d(I) \subset I$.

## Properties

The [[quotient algebra]] of a [[differential algebra]] by a differential ideal inherits the structure of a differential algebra.
