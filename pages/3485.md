## Definition

A _permutation representation_ is a [[representation]] on [[Set]], i.e. a [[functor]] $C \to $ [[Set]]. 

A _linear permutation representation_ is a functor $C \to $ [[Vect]] that factors through a permutation representation via the functor $k^{|-|} :  Set \to Vect$ which sends a set to the vector space for which this set is a basis.

**Warning** Often in the literature "linear permutaton representations" are just called "permutation representations".

## Examples

Notably for $C = \mathbf{B}G$ the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] of a [[group]] $G$, a permutation representation $\mathbf{B}G \to Set$ is a set equipped with a $G$-[[action]].

The category 

$$
  Rep(G, Set) \simeq PSh(B G)
$$

is the [[classifying topos]] for the group $G$.
