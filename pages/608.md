## Definition 

A **simplicial object in  $Cat$** is a particular case of [[simplicial object]], of course, with the $C$ there being $Cat$.  It therefore has a simplicial set of objects and a simplicial set of morphisms.


**Remark** A simplicial object in $\Cat$ is sometimes called a [[simplicial category]], but that has other meanings.
