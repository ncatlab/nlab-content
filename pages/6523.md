## Definition

For $(X,g)$ a [[Riemannian manifold]] or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] its **isometry group**

$$
  Iso(X,g) \subset Diff(X)
$$

is that subgroup of the group of all [[diffeomorphism]]s $\phi : X \to X$ that are [[isometries]]: which preserve the [[metric]] $g$ in that

$$
  \phi^* g = g
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Killing vectors

The [[Lie algebra]] of $Iso(X,g)$ is spanned by the [[Killing vector]]s of $(X,g)$.

## Examples

* The isometry group of [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the [[Poincar√© group]].

* The isometry group of [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] is the [[anti de Sitter group]].

* The isometry group of [[de Sitter spacetime]] is the [[de Sitter group]].
