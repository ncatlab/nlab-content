In noncommutative [[ring]] theory, particularly in the subject of noncommutative [[localization]] of rings, a __kernel functor__ is any left exact subfunctor of the identity functor on the category $R$-$\mathrm{Mod}$ of left modules over a ring $R$. There is a bijective correspondence between kernel functors and [[uniform filter]]s of ideals in $R$. A kernel functor $\sigma$ is said to be __idempotent kernel functor__ if $\sigma(M/\sigma(M))=0$ for all $M$ in $R$-$\mathrm{Mod}$.

which is clearly written from the point of view of a ring theorist. Unfortunately, it just creates another formalism in localization theory of the categories of modules over a ring for basically the same results as P. Gabriel succeeded by more categorical formulations in his thesis published 7 years earlier. Some of the methods from Goldman, and even more from Gabriel apply for more general [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]].
