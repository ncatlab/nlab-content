## Idea

### General
 {#General}

In [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theory]] with [[extended supersymmetry]], certain extremal [[supermultiplets]] have some of the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetries]] retained (have 0-[[eigenvalue]] under some of the [[supersymmetry]] generators). These are called __Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield saturated solutions__. 

More in detail, where in a plain [[supersymmetry]] [[super Lie algebra]] a suitable [[basis]] $\{Q_A\}$ of supersymmetry generators has odd bracket proportional to the spacetime translation and hence to an [[energy]]/[[mass]] operator $E$ (with terminology as at [[unitary representation of the Poincaré group]])

$$
 \{Q_A, Q_B\} = E \delta_{A B}
$$

for [[extended supersymmetry]] there are further bosonic super Lie algebra generators $K_{A B}$ (charges) such that

$$
 \{Q_A, Q_B\} = E \delta_{A B} -  K_{A B}
 \,.
$$

If follows from the supersymmetry algebra that $(E \delta_{A B} -  K_{A B})$ is a positive definte [[bilinear form]], which puts a lower bound on the energy given the values of these extra charges. This is called the _BPS bound_.

In partciular when this bound is satisfied in that some of the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[matrix]] $(K_{A B})$ are actually equal to the energy/mass, then the corresponding component of the right hand side in the above equation vanishes and hence then the corresponding supersymmetry generators may annihilate the given state, then called a _BPS state_. This way enhanced supersymmetry of states goes along with certain charges taken extremal values.


States with similar behaviour are also considered also in some models of [[soliton]] theory
(English Wikipedia: [Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield bound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomol'nyi%E2%80%93Prasad%E2%80%93Sommerfield_bound)). 

BPS states play a central role in the investigation of [[moduli spaces]] of classical [[vacua]] as they form part of the moduli problem which is often the most tractable.

Several mathematical theories in [[geometry]] are interpreted as counting BPS-states in the sense of integration on appropriate compactification of the moduli space of BPS-states in a related physical model attached to the underlying geometry: most notably the [[Gromov-Witten invariants]], [[Donaldson-Thomas invariants]] and the [[Thomas-Pandharipande invariants]]; all the three seem to be deeply interrelated though they are defined in rather very different terms. The compactification of the moduli space involves various stability conditions. 


### In supergravity

In the context of [[supergravity]] BPS states correspond to [[super spacetimes]] admitting [[Killing vectors]]. These notably include extremal [[black brane]] solutions.

### In superstring theory

Specifically in [[superstring theory]] BPS states in [[target space]] correspond to string states on the worldsheet which are annihilated by the left-moving (say) half of the [[Dirac-Ramond operator]]. These are counted by the [[Witten genus]], see at _[Witten genus -- Relation to BPS states](Witten+genus#RelationToBPSStateCounting)_.

The degeneracy of BPS states in string theory has been used to provide a microscopic interpretation of [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of [[black holes]], see at _[[black holes in string theory]]_.

## Formalization in higher differential geometry
 {#InTermsOfHigherDifferentialGeometry}

> The following are some observations on the formalization of BPS states from the [[nPOV]], in [[higher differential geometry]], following ([Sati-Schreiber 15](#SatiSchreiber15)).

Let $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N}$ be a [[super-Minkowski spacetime]], let $(d,N,p)$ be in the [[brane scan]] and write

$$
  \phi \coloneqq \bar \psi \wedge E^{\wedge p} \wedge \psi \in \Omega^{p+2}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})
$$

for the correspoding [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|cocycle]], as discussed at _[[Green-Schwarz action functional]]_, see ([FSS 13](#FSS13)) for the perspective invoked here.

Consider then $X$ a [[super-spacetime]] locally modeled on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N}$ as a [[Cartan geometry]], solving the relevant [[supergravity]] [[equations of motion]] (e.g. [[11-dimensional supergravity]] for $d= 11$, [[heterotic supergravity]] for $d = 10$ and $N = (1,0)$, [[type IIA supergravity]] for $d = 10$ and $N= (1,1)$ or [[type IIB supergravity]] for $d = 10$ $N= (2,0)$).

This means in particular that $X$ carries a [[super differential form]]

$$
  \omega \in \Omega^{p+2}(X)
$$

which is [[definite form|definite]] on $\phi$. This is the [[curvature]] of the [[WZW-term]] which defines the relevant [[super p-brane sigma-model]] with [[target space]] $X$.

By ([AGIT 89](#AGIT89)) $X$ is a BPS state to the extent that it carries [[Killing spinors]] which form a central [[Lie algebra extension]] of a sub-algebra of the [[supersymmetry]] algebra (i.e. of the [[super translation Lie algebra]]) by $H^p_{dR}(X)$ which is classified by the [[Lie algebra cohomology|cocycle]] given by

$$
  (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2) \mapsto
  \omega(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)
  \in 
  \Omega^p(X)_{cl}/im(\mathbf{d}_{dR})
  \,.
$$

Now we observe that by ([hgpII, theorem 3.3.1](#hgpII)) this is precisely the [[0-truncation]] of the [[super L-infinity algebra|super]]-[[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra]] $\mathfrak{Pois}(X,\omega)$ induced by regarding $(X,\omega)$ as an [[pre-n-plectic manifold|pre-n-plectic]] [[supermanifold]] and restricting along the inclusion of the [[Killing vectors]]/[[Killing spinors]] into all the [[Hamiltonian vector fields]].

$$
  H^p_{dR}(X) \to \tau_0 \mathfrak{Pois}(X,\omega) \to Vect_{Ham}(X)
$$

(Here we are using that if an [[n-type]] is an extension of a [[0-type]], then its 0-truncation is still an extension by the 0-truncation of the original homotopy fiber.)

The elements in $H^p_{dR}(X)$ here are precisely the $p$-brane charges, as discussed in ([AGIT 89, p. 8](#AGIT89)).

Hence $X$ is the more BPS the more odd-graded elements there are in $\tau_0 \mathfrak{Pois}(X,\omega)$ (or its restriction to super-isometries). Hence $X$ is a 1/2 BPS state of supergravity if the odd dimension of this is half that of $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,d|N}$, it is 1/4 BPS if the odd dimension is one fourth of that of $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,d|N}$, etc.

Notice that if 

$$
  \array{
    &&     
     \mathbf{B}^{p+1} (\mathbb{R}/\Gamma)_{conn}
    \\
    &  {}^{\mathllap{\mathbf{L}_{WZW}}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{(-)}}}   
    \\
    X 
    &\stackrel{\omega}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{p+2}_{cl}
  } 
$$

is a [[prequantum line n-bundle|prequantization]] of $\omega$, i.e. an actual [[WZW term]] with [[curvature]] $\omega$, then $\mathfrak{Pois}(X,\omega)$ is supposed to be the [[Lie differentiation]] of the [[stabilizer group]] of $\mathbf{L}_{WZW}$, which is the [[quantomorphism n-group]] $QuantMorph(\mathbf{L}_{WZW})$. (This Lie differentiation statement is strictly shown only for $p = 0$ and $p = 1$ in [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct]] but clearly should hold generally.)

Hence we may regard $\mathbf{QuantMorph}(\mathbf{L}_{WZW})$ (or its restriction to super-[[isometries]]) as the [[Lie integration]] of the brane-charge extended supersymmetry algebra. By the discussion at _[conserved current -- In higher differential geometry](conserved+current#InHigherPrequantumGeometry)_ this is indeed the [[n-group]] of conserved currents of $\mathbf{L}_{WZW}$ regraded as a [[local Lagrangian]], and so this conceptually connects back to the considerations in ([AGIT 89](#AGIT89)).



## Examples

### In 11d Supergravity 

In [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([[M-theory]]) there are four kinds of 1/2 BPS states (the [[black brane|black]] [[M-branes]]) (e.g. [Stelle 98, section 3](#Stelle98) [EHKNT 07](#EHKNT07)):

* the [[M2-brane]];

* the [[M5-brane]];

* the [[M-wave]];

* the [[Kaluza-Klein monopole]].
