The _supergravity Lie 3-algebra_ $\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)$ is a shifted central extension of super [[L-infinity-algebra|âˆž-Lie algebra]]s

$$
  0 \to b^2 \mathfrak{u}(1) \to 
  \mathfrak{sugra}(10,1) \to
  \mathfrak{siso}(10,1)
  \to
  0
$$

of the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}(10,1)$ in 10+1 dimensions induced by a [[Lie algebra cohomology|super Lie algebra 4-cocycle]] $\mu_4$.

This is the same mechanism by which the [[String Lie 2-algebra]] is a shifted central extensiono of $\mathfrak{so}(n)$.

In the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] it is realized (more or less explicitly) that maximal 11-dimensional [[supergravity]] as a [[classical field theory]] is a higher [[gauge theory]] with coefficients in the supergravity Lie 3-algebra.
