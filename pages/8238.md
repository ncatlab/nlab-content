## Idea

A _tower_ is a [[diagram]] of the shape of the [[poset]] of [[natural numbers]]

$$
  \cdots \to X_2 \to X_1 \to X_0 
  \,.
$$


A [[limit]] over a diagram of this form is called a [[sequential limit]]/[[directed limit]].


Different contexts lead to different notions of morphism of towers, so it is important to consider what category of towers is appropriate for any given use of these objects. In addition to [[Postnikov towers]], and related uses in decomposing homotopy types, towers also occur as a simple type of [[pro-object]] in a category.  In that situation the morphisms considered between towers are usually pro-morphisms.

In [[homotopy theory]] in the presence of [[(infinity,1)-limits]]/[[(infinity,1)-colimits]], every tower is a [[tower of homotopy fibers]].


## Pro-category of towers

The tower diagram shape $\mathbb{N}_{\geq} = \{\cdots 3\to 2 \to 1 \to 0\}$ is evidently a small [[cofiltered category]]. As such it makes sense to consider _pro-morphisms_ between tower diagrams, i.e. considering, for any small category $\mathcal{C}$, the [[full subcategory]]

$$
  i
   \;\colon\;
  Tow(\mathcal{C})
    \overset{\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^f}{\hookrightarrow}
  Pro(\mathcal{C})
    \hookrightarrow
  PSh(\mathcal{C})
$$

of that of [[pro-objects]] in $\mathcal{C}$ on those that have presentation by formal [[sequential limits]].

For $X_\bullet \colon \mathbb{N}_{\geq} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ a tower diagram, we write

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^f X_\bullet \in Pro(\mathcal{C}) 
$$

for its formal cofiltered limit.

Notice that generally we have that morphisms between formal cofiltered limits (pro-objects) of shapes $\mathcal{K}_1$ and $\mathcal{K}_2$, respectively, are represented as cofiltered limits of systems of morphisms indeced on a single cofiltered category $\mathcal{K}$ equipped with [[final functors]] to $\mathcal{K}_1$ and $\mathcal{K}_2$, respectively. (See at _[[ind-object]]_ [this prop.](ind-object#MorphismsRepresentedByCofilteredSystemsOfMorphisms)).

The following says that in the case that both shapes are towers, then also $\mathcal{K}$ may always be chosen to be of tower shape:

###### Claim


For $X_\bullet$ and $Y_\bullet$ two tower diagrams in $\mathcal{C}$, then every morphism

$$  
   \phi
     \;\colon\;
   \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^f X_\bullet
     \longrightarrow
   \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^f Y_\bullet
$$

between their formal cofiltered limits (every pro-morphism between the diagrams) in $Pro(\mathcal{C})$ is represented by component morphisms

$$
  \phi_{k} \;\colon\; X_{h(k)} \longrightarrow X_k
$$

making [[commuting diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
     X_{h(k+1)} &\overset{\phi_{k+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{k+1}
     \\
     \downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow
     \\
     X_{h(k)}
       &\underset{\phi_k}{\longrightarrow}&  
     Y_k
  }
$$

i.e. by a [[natural transformation]] $\phi_\bullet$ between

$$
  \mathbb{N}_{\geq} \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{N}_{\geq} \overset{X_\bullet}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{C}
$$

and

$$
  \mathbb{N}_{\geq} \overset{Y_\bullet}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{C}
$$

as 

$$
  \phi \simeq \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^f (\phi_\bullet)
  \,.
