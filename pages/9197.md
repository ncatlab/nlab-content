contain an early proposal that ([[topological field theory|topological]]) [[quantum field theory]] should have an "[[extended quantum field theory|extended]]" or "multi-tiered" formulation which involves not just [[vector spaces]] of phases/staes in [[codimension]] 1, but also [[n-vector space|(n-k)-vector spaces]] in [[codimension]] $k$.

This is a first indication of the structure that was later made precise by [[Jacob Lurie]] in _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_ by [[extended field theory]] in terms of [[(infinity,n)-functors]] on the [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]].
