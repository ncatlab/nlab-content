## Idea

A  _foundational axiom_ is an [[axiom]] that would be used in [[foundations]].


## Examples

* [[large cardinal]]
  * [[axiom of infinity]]
  * [[Grothendieck universe]]
  * [[universe in a topos]]
  * [[inaccessible cardinal]]
  * [[measurable cardinal]] 
  * [[elementary embedding]]
  * [[supercompact cardinal]]
  * [[Vopěnka's principle]]

* [[axiom of choice]]
  * [[countable choice]]
  * [[dependent choice]]
  * [[COSHEP]]
  * [[small violations of choice]]
  * [[WISC]]
  * [[excluded middle]]

* strong axioms
  * [[axiom of separation]]
  * [[axiom of replacement]]


* basic constructions:
  * [[axiom of cartesian products]]
  * [[axiom of disjoint unions]]
  * [[axiom of the empty set]]
  * [[axiom of fullness]]
  * [[axiom of function sets]]
  * [[axiom of power sets]]
