  This is an expository article for a general mathematical readership. It describes [[ETCS]], but without assuming any knowledge of category theory or ever defining a category.

  Short description from author's web page for book:

  > Basic Category Theory is an introductory category theory textbook. Features:
  >
  > * It doesn't assume much, either in terms of background or mathematical maturity.
  >
  > * It sticks to the basics.
  >
  > * It's short.
  >
  > Advanced topics are omitted, leaving more space for careful explanations of the core concepts. I have used versions of this text to teach final-year undergraduate and master's-level courses at the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh.


* _Higher operads, higher categories_, London Math. Soc. Lec. Note Series __298__, [math.CT/0305049](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0305049)
