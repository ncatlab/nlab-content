In his Spencer lecture, delivered at Oxford in 1933, Einstein stressed the importance to be accorded to formal beauty: 

> Experience can of course guide us in our choice of serviceable mathematical concepts; it cannot possibly be the source from which they are derived; experience of course remains the sole criterion of the serviceability of a mathematical construction for physics, but the truly creative principle resides in mathematics.

### Gravitational waves

The first article that _correctly_ derived [[gravitational waves]] from the [[Einstein equations]] is 

* {#Einstein18} [[Albert Einstein]], _&#220;ber Gravitationswellen_, Sitzungsberichte der K&#246;niglich Preu&#223;ischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin (1918), 154-167

In particular this correctly stated that gravitational waves require a [[quadrupole moment]] as a [[source]] (e.g. a rotating binary star system) and not just a [[dipole moment]] (e.g. an oscillating charge) as for [[electromagnetic waves]] (the [[graviton]] has [[spin]] 2, the [[photon]] has spin 1...), thereby correcting a mistake to this effect in the earlier article

The reality of gravitational wave solutions however kept being a cause of concern for many years (Einstein himself was concerned that the linearization approximation used in their derivation might have been too coarse), for a brief account of the early history see
