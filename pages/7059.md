## Idea

_Cohesive homotopy type theory_ is an [[axiom|axiomatic]] [[theory]] of [[higher geometry]], the pairing of [[geometry]] in general and of [[differential geometry]] in particular with [[homotopy theory]].
The _[[objects]]_ or _[[types]]_ that it descrives are _[[cohesive topos|cohesive]] [[homotopy types]]_, hence [[cohesive ∞-groupoids]], such as for instance [[smooth ∞-groupoids]].

To the extent that plain [[homotopy type theory]] is a formalization of [[homotopy theory]] in that it is the [[internal language of an (∞,1)-topos]], _cohesive_ homotopy type theory is the [[internal logic|internal language]] of a _[[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]_.

One way to arrive at cohesive homotopy type theory is to start with the external axioms for [[cohesive toposes|cohesion]] on a given [[topos]] in terms of an [[adjoint quadruple]] of functors _on_ the given [[topos]] and attempt to formulate them instead in the [[internal logic|internal]] [[Mitchell-Bénabou language|Mitchell-Bénabou]] [[type theory]] language of the topos. This fails, since for formulating the [[reflective subcategories]] of [[discrete objects]] and [[codiscrete objects]] internally one needs instead of the [[type of propositions]] a full [[type of types]], as exists only in [[homotopy type theory]]. Passing to this, the axioms for cohesion can be formulated ([Shulman](#ShulmanInternalizing)) and are automatically that of [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|homotopy cohesion]].

## The Axioms

We discuss the formulation in [[homotopy type theory]] of the [internal axioms](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#InternalDefinition) on a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

## Structures in cohesive homotopy type theory

We discuss implications of the axioms of cohesive homotopy type theory and go through the discussion of the various [[structures in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].
