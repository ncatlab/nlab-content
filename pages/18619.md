## Idea

In [[physics]] ([[field theory]]) a _local observable_ is an [[observable]] which is an average of a function of the values of the [[field (physics)|fields]] and their [[derivatives]] at each fixed spacetime point.

If $\Phi$ is a [[field (physics)|field configuration]] over some [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ then a local observable is a function of $\Phi$ which, assigns values of the form

$$
  \Phi
    \;\mapsto\;
  \int_\Sigma f(\Phi(x), \nabla \Phi(x), \nabla^2 \Phi(x), \cdots) b(x) dvol_\Sigma(x)
$$

where $f$ is some [[smooth function]] of its arguments and $b$ is some [[bump function]] on [[spacetime]].

This is in contrast to an observable which combines the values of fields at different spacetime points other than by forming spacetime averages. For instance if $x \neq y \in \Sigma$ are two distinct spacetime points, then 


$$
  \Phi \mapsto \Phi(x) \Phi(y)
$$

is a smooth function on the space of fields, hence an [[observable]], but it is not a local observables.

More in detail, if 

$$
  \array{
    E 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$

is a [[fiber bundle]] regarded as the [[field bundle]] that defines the given [[field theory]], then a local observables is a function on the the space of field configurations, hence the [[space of sections]] $\Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ (or else on the subspace of those which solve the [[equations of motion]], the [[shell]]) which arises as the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]] of a [[horizontal differential form]] of degree $dim(\Sigma)$ on the [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ of $E$.

Products of local observables are called _multilocal observables_.

###### Example
**([[polynomial]] [[local observables]] are [[polynomial observables]])**

A [[local observable]] which comes form a [[variational differential form|horizontal differential form]] which is a [[polynomial]] in the fields and their jets times the [[volume form]] on [[spacetime]] is a [[polynomial observable]].

These happen to be also [[microcausal observables]] ([this example](microcausal+functional#CompactlySupportedPolynomialLocalDensities)).
