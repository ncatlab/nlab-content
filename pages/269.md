#Definition#

A **cubical set** is a [[presheaf]] on the [[cube category]] $\Box$. 

#Idea#

The definition is to be understood from the point of view of [[space and quantity]]: a _cubical set_ is a space characterized by the fact that and how it may be _probed_ by mapping standard cellular [[cube]]s into it: the set $S_n$ assigned by a cubical set to the standard $n$-[[cube]] $[n]$ is the set of $n$-[[cube]]s in this space, hence the way of mapping a standard $n$-[[cube]] into this spaces.

Being a functor $S : \Box^{op} \to Set$, a cubical set $S$ also assigns maps between its sets $S_n$ of $n$-simplices which determine in which way smaller cubes sit inside larger cubes.

The **face maps**  go from sets $S_{n+1}$ of $(n+1)$-dimensional cubes to the corresponding set $S_{n}$ of $n$-dimensional cubes and can be thought of as sending each cube in the cubical set to one of its faces, for instance for $n=1$ the set $S_2$ of 2-cubes  would be sent in four different ways by four different face maps to the set of $1$-cubes, for instance one of the face maps would send

$$
  \left(
  \array{
     a &\to& b
     \\
     \downarrow &\Downarrow^F& \downarrow
     \\
     c &\to& d
  }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     a &\to& b
  }
  \right)
$$

another one would send

$$
  \left(
  \array{
     a &\to& b
     \\
     \downarrow &\Downarrow^F& \downarrow
     \\
     c &\to& d
  }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     a
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     c
  }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

On the other hand, the **degeneracy maps** go the other way round and send sets $S_n$ of $n$-cubes to sets $S_{n+1}$ of $(n+1)$-cubes by regarding an $n$-cube as a degenerate or "thin" $(n+1)$-cube in the various different ways that this is possible. For instance again for $n=1$ a degeneracy map may act by sending

$$
  \left(
  \array{
     a
     &\stackrel{f}{\to}&
     b
  }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
     \\
     \downarrow^{Id} &\Downarrow^{Id}& \downarrow^{Id}
     \\
     a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Notice the $Id$-labels, which indicate that the edges and faces labeled by them are "thin" in much the same way as an [[identity]] [[morphism]] is thin (notice however that a cubical set by itself is not equipped with a notion of composition of cubes. If it were, we'd call it a [[cubical category]]).

In an ordinary cubical set all degeneracy maps act in the kind of way depicted above. One might also want to require a cubical set to contain "thin" cells between equal _adjacent_ faces. These **extra degeneracy maps** act by sending 1-cells to degenerate 2-cells of the form

$$\left(\array{
a&\stackrel{f}{\to}&b
}\right)
\;\;
\mapsto
\;\;
\left(\array{
a & \stackrel{f}{\to} & b \\
\downarrow^{f} & \Downarrow & \downarrow^{Id} \\
b & \stackrel{Id}{\to} & b
}\right)
\,.
$$

If the cubical set has this additional property, one calls it a [[connection on a cubical set|cubical set with connection]].

#Geometric realization#

If $X$ is a cubical set, the _geometric realization_ $|X|$ may be defined as the weighted colimit (a [[end|coend]]) in [[Top]] 

$$X \otimes_{\Box} I^{\bullet} = \int^{n \in \Box} X(n) \cdot I^n$$ 

where $I^{\bullet}: (\Box, \otimes, I) \to (\Top, \times, 1)$ is the unique (up to isomorphism) monoidal functor mapping the generating object $int$ to $[0, 1]$, and for $k = 0, 1$, mapping $i_k$ to the inclusion $\{k\} \hookrightarrow [0, 1]$. This is parallel to one way of defining the geometric realization of a [[simplicial set]]. 
Geometric realization is a functor [[left adjoint]] to the functor 
$$cub: Top \to Set^{\Box^{op}}$$ 
which takes a space $S$ to the functor $\hom_{Top}(I^{\bullet}-, S)$. 


# Background# 

The notion of cubical set and of homology theory and homotopy theory based on singular cubes goes way back in the literature. Serre's work on spectral sequences and fibre spaces was based on cubes. Kan's early work on combinatorial homotopy was based on cubes. However the category of cubical sets was found to have a major disadvantage compared with simplicial sets, in that the cartesian product in this category failed to have the correct homotopy type. 

Nonetheless cubical sets continued to have a kind of underground existence. 

Brown and Higgins introduced the extra structure of [[connection on a cubical set|connection]]s $\Gamma^\pm_i$ on cubical sets, and included this structure into their cubical  [[omega-groupoid]]s. All this structure was essential for the equivalence with [[crossed complex]]es and for the applications to homotopy theory. For example these omega-groupoids have a canonical structure of [[thin element]]s, defined as any composition of elements of the form $\pm \epsilon_j x, \pm \Gamma^\pm_i$. Such elements have "commuting boundary". 

The geometric realisation of cubical sets with connections, and the relation with cartesian products, has not yet been analysed. 

Nonetheless, the advantages of cubes are:

1. Easy notions of multiple compositions (compared with the globular pasting schemes); 

1. Good notions of tensor product, because of the rule $I^m \times I^n \cong I^{m+n}$, and hence easy conceptual handling of homotopies.  

For the first of these, we refer to [[compositions in cubical sets]].
