There are two general types of strategies for defining and handling [[higher category theory|higher categories]]. In the _geometric_ approach a higher category is defined to be a [[simplicial set]] (or more generally a [[presheaf]] over a [[geometric shapes for higher structures|suitable category of shapes]], such as [[opetope]]s) with [[extra properties]].

From the alternative point of view of [[algebraic definition of higher category]] the simplicial set here is the [[nerve]] of the $\infty$-category which it encodes.

The simplest example is the concept of [[Kan complex]]. Slightly more general is the notion of [[quasi-category]]. If one keeps relaxing conditions this way while keeping the required coherence, one arrives at the definition of weak $\infty$-category given by Ross Street, developed at [[simplicial model for weak omega-categories]].
