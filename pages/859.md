## Definitions

If a [[group]] $G$ [[action|acts]] on a group $\Gamma$ (on the left, say) by group [[automorphism]]

$$  
  \rho : G \to Aut(\Gamma)
  \,,
$$

then there is a
__semidirect product__ group whose underlying set is the [[product]] $\Gamma \times  G$
but whose multiplication is twisted by $\rho$:

$$
  (\delta,h)(\gamma,g)= (\delta \rho(h)(\gamma) , h g)
$$

for $\delta, \gamma \in \Gamma,\; h,g \in G$, where $^h \gamma$ denotes the result of acting with $h$ on the left on $\gamma$. 

This is called in
[[group theory]] the **semidirect product** and written $\Gamma \rtimes \, G$.

There is a [[projection]] morphism $p:\Gamma \rtimes \, G \to G$ ,
$(\gamma, g) \to g$. A [[section]] $s$ of this can be identified with a
[[derivation]] $d$, i.e. $d$  satisfies $d(h g) = (d h) \,^h (d g)$.


### Interior semidirect products

Let $H$ be any group.  A decomposition of $H$ as an __internal__ semidirect product consists of a [[subgroup]] $\Gamma$ and a [[normal subgroup]] $G$, such that every element of $H$ can be written uniquely in the form $\gamma g$, for $\gamma \in \Gamma$ and $g \in G$.

The internal and external concepts are equivalent.  In particular, any (external) semidirect product $\Gamma \rtimes G$ is an internal semidirect product of the [[images]] of $\Gamma$ and $G$ in it.


### Right semidirect products

The definitions above are not symmetric in left and right; since the first definition begins with a left action, we may call it a *left* semidirect product.  Then a __right__ semidirect product is given by an action on the right, or internally by the requirement that every element can be written in the form $g \gamma$.

However, right and left semidirect products are equivalent.  Essentially, this is because any left action $(h,g) \mapsto {}^h{g}$ defines a right action $(g,h) \mapsto g^h \coloneqq {}^{h^{-1}}g$ and vice versa.


### Semidirect products of groupoids

It is useful to generalise this to the case $\Gamma$ is a [[groupoid]].
This occurs if for example $\Gamma = \pi_1 X$ where $X$ is a (left)
$G$-space.

So if $X=Ob(\Gamma)$, then $\Gamma \rtimes \, G$ has object set $X$ and
a morphism $y \to x$ is a pair $(\gamma,g)$ such that $\gamma: y \to
g x$ in $\Gamma$. The composition law is then given again by   

$$(\delta,h)(\gamma,g)= (\delta \, ^h \gamma, h g) $$

if  $(\delta, h): z \to y$, so that $\delta: z \to h y$ in $\Gamma$. 

If $\Gamma$ is a discrete groupoid, and so identified with $X$, then
we get $X \rtimes \, G$ which is the [[action groupoid]] of the action. In
this case the projection $p: X \rtimes \, G \to G$ is a covering
morphism of groupoids, i.e.  any $g \in G$ has a unique lifting with
given initial point. Note that if $Y \to X $ is a covering map of
spaces, then the induced morphism of fundamental groupoids is a
covering morphism of groupoids. If $q: H \to \pi_1 X$ is a covering
morphism of groupoids, and $X$ admits a universal covering map, then
there is a topology on $Y=Ob(H)$ such that $H \cong \pi_1 Y$. In
this way, the category of covering maps of $X$ is equivalent to the
category of covering morphisms of $\pi_1 X$.

The utility of the more general construction is that there is notion
of orbit groupoid $\Gamma //G$ (identify any $\gamma$ and $^g
\gamma$) and it is a theorem that the orbit groupoid is isomorphic to
the quotient groupoid

$$ (\Gamma \rtimes \, G)/N$$

where $N$ is the normal closure in $\Gamma \rtimes \, G$ of all
elements $(1_x,g)$. Details are in the book reference below (but the
conventions are not quite the same).


## Properties

### As split group extensions

Semidirect product groups $A \rtimes_\rho G$ are precisely the split [[group extensions]] of $G$ by $A$. See at [group extension -- split extensions and semidirect product groups](group+extension#SplitExtensionsAndSemidirectProductGroups).

## Examples

### The automorphisms on the circle group

For $U(1) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ the [[circle group]], the [[automorphism group]] is 

$$
  Aut(U(1)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
  \,,
$$

where the nontrivial element in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts on $\mathbb{R}$ by multiplication with $-1$. Write $\rho_{aut} : U(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \to U(1)$ for the automorphism [[action]]. The corresponding semidirect product group is the [[group extension]]

$$
  U(1) \stackrel{}{\hookrightarrow} U(1) \rtimes_{\rho_{aut}} \mathbb{Z}_2
  \to \mathbb{Z}_2
$$

where the group operation is given by

$$
  (c_1 \; mod \; \mathbb{Z}, \sigma_1)
  \cdot
  (c_2\; mod \; \mathbb{Z}, \sigma_2)
  = 
  (c_1 + \sigma_1(c_2) \; mod \; \mathbb{Z}, \sigma_1 + \sigma_2)
  \,.
$$
