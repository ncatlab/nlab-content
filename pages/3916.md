## Idea

Given an [[embedding]] of [[manifold]]s $i : X \hookrightarrow Y$, the _Thom collapse map_ is a useful approximation to its would-be [[left inverse]].

## Definition

All [[topological space]]s in the following are taken to be [[compact space|compact]].

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two [[manifold]]s and let 

$$
  i : X \hookrightarrow Y
$$ 

be an [[embedding]].  Write $N_i X$ for the [[normal bundle]] $i^* T Y/ T X$ of the immersion $i$ of $X$ and let $f : N_i X \to Y$ be any [[tubular neighbourhood]] of $i$. Finally write $Th(N_i X)$ for the [[Thom space]] of the normal bundle.

###### Definition

The **collapse map** (or the _Pontrjagin-Thom construction_) associated to $i$ and the choice of tubular neighbourhood $f$ is 

$$
  c_i : Y \to Y/(Y - f(N_i X)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   Th(N_i X)
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is the projection onto the [[quotient]] [[topological space]] and the second is the canonical [[homeomorphism]] to the [[Thom space]] of the [[normal bundle]].

=--

Since every point of $N_i X$ is associated to a particular point of $X$, this map can be refined to a map

$$ Y \to X_+ \wedge Th(N_i X) $$

If $Y = S^n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then this refined Thom collapse map induces a stable map $S \to \Sigma_+^\infty X \wedge \Sigma^{-n} Th(N_i X)$, where $S$ denotes the [[sphere spectrum]].  This stable map is the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] which exhibits the [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma_+^\infty X$ as a [[dualizable object]] in the [[stable homotopy category]].  See [[n-duality]] and [[fixed point index]].

Equivalently, one may proceed as follows. For a framed manifold i.e. a manifold $M^n$ with a chosen trivialization of the normal bundle $N_i (M^n)$ in some $\mathbf{R}^{n+r}$ one has $T N_i(M^n)\cong \Sigma^r(M^n_+)$ where $M^n_+$ is the union of $M^n$ with a disjoint base point. Identify a sphere $S^{n+r}$ with a one-point compactification  $\mathbf{R}^{n+r}\cup \{\infty\}$. Then the Pontrjagin-Thom construction is the map $S^{n+r}\to Th(N_i X)$ obtained by collapsing the complement of the interior of the unit disc bundle $D(N_i M^n)$ to the point corresponding to $S(N_i M^n)$ and by mapping each point of $D(N_i M^n)$ to itself. Thus to a framed manifold $M^n$ one associates the composition

$$
S^{n+r}\to Th(N_i X)\cong \Sigma^r M^n_+\to S^r
$$

and its homotopy class defines an element in $\pi_{n+r}(S^r)$.
