## Idea

Given an [[embedding]] of [[manifold]]s $i : X \hookrightarrow Y$, the _Thom collaps map_ is a useful approximation to its would-be [[left inverse]].

## Definition

All [[topological space]]s in the following are taken to be [[compact space|compact]].

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two [[manifold]]s and let 

$$
  i : X \hookrightarrow Y
$$ 

be an [[embedding]].  Write $N_i X$ for the [[normal bundle]] of $X$ relative to $i$ and let $f : N_i X \to Y$ be any [[tubular neighbourhood]] of $i$. Finally write $Th(N_i X)$ for the [[Thom space]] of the normal bundle.

###### Definition

The **collaps map** associated to $i$ and the choice of tubular neighbourhood $f$ is 

$$
  c_i : Y \to Y/(Y - f(N_i X)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   Th(N_i X)
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is the projection onto the [[quotient]] [[topological space]] and the second is the canonical [[homeomorphism]] to the [[Thom space]] of the [[normal bundle]].

###### Proposition

For given $i$ all collaps maps for different choices of [[tubular neighbourhood]] $f$ are [[homotopy|homotopic]].

###### Proof

By the fact that the space of [[tubular neighbourhood]]s (see there for details) is [[contractible]].
