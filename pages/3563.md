A partial combinatory algebra is a generalization of a model of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] allowing for application to be only partially defined. (The precise definition is...)

From any PCA, a corresponding "realizability tripos" can be constructed, from which, in turn, a corresponding "realizability topos" can be constructed, as outlined in the article on [[tripos]]es.

# Examples
* Any cartesian closed category generated by a single object $X$ such that $X^X$ is a retract of $X$ provides a trivial example, by virtue of being a [[total combinatory algebra]]
* [[Kleene's first algebra]] (the PCA whose elements are natural numbers taken as codes for computer programs taking natural number input and producing natural number output if they halt, with obvious application partial function). The realizability topos for this is also called the [[effective topos]].
* [[Kleene's second algebra]]
