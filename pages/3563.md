## Idea 

A partial combinatory algebra is a generalization of a model of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] allowing for application to be only partially defined. 

## Definition 

The following definitions are taken from [Hofstra](#Hofstra). 

A _partial applicative structure_ is a set equipped with a partial binary operation 

$$m \colon A \times A \to A$$ 

An [[function application|application]] of $m$ is indicated by juxtaposition: $a b$ denotes $m(a, b)$ if (and only if) $m(a, b)$ is defined, i.e., if $(a, b)$ belongs to the [[domain]] of $m$. _Homomorphisms_ between partial applicative structures $A, B$ are defined to be total functions $f \colon A \to B$ such that $f(a b) = f(a)f(b)$, meaning the right side is defined whenever the left side is. In other words, in the locally posetal [[bicategory]] of sets and [[relation|relations]], we have a 2-cell 

$$\array{
A \times A & \stackrel{f \times f}{\to} & B \times B \\
m \downarrow & \leq & \downarrow m \\
A & \underset{f}{\to} & B
}$$ 

By convention, unbracketed juxtapositions are associated to the left, so that for example $x y z$ means $(x y)z$. 

If $A$ is a partial applicative structure and $\mathbf{Magma}(A)$ is the free [[magma]] on the underlying set of $A$, then we have an evident partial function 

$$\alpha \colon \mathbf{Magma}(A) \to A$$ 

which evaluates binary words in $A$ as elements in $A$, whenever possible.

###### Definition 
A partial applicative structure $A$ is a _partial combinatory algebra_ (a **PCA**) if there are elements $k, s \in A$ such that 
* For all $a, b \in A$, $k a$ and $k a b$ are defined and $k a b = a$. 
* For all $a, b \in A$, $s a$ and $s a b$ are defined and for all $c$, $(a c)(b c)$ is defined if and only if $s a b c$ is defined, and $s a b c = (a c)(b c)$. 

A _homomorphism_ of PCA's is a homomorphism of the underlying partial applicative structures. 

A _total_ combinatory algebra is a PCA $A$ whose application $m \colon A \times A \to A$ is a total function. 
=-- 

Note that appropriate elements $k$, $s$ are not considered part of the structure (to be preserved under homomorphism) -- here one is interested only in the property that such elements exist. Indeed, they need not be uniquely determined within the PCA. 

## Functional completeness 

The definition of PCA given above is traditional but somewhat opaque at first glance. The real point of the definition is that a PCA is the same thing as a partial applicative structure $A$ that enjoys a _functional completeness_ property, in the following sense. 

Let $X$ be a countably infinite set of "variables", and let $A[X]$ denote the [[magma]] freely generated from the disjoint sum $A + X$. Each term $t$, i.e., each element $t \in A[X]$, has finitely many $x_i \in X$ occurring inside it; these are called the _free variables_ of $t$, and we write $FV(t)$ for the set of free variables. If $FV(t) \subseteq \{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$, then we can think of $t$ as giving a partially defined function in $n+1$ variables. That is, we may consider $t$ as a term of $\mathbf{Magma}(A + \{x_0, \ldots, x_n\})$, and (partially) define the [[substitution]] $t[a_0/x_0, \ldots, a_n/x_n]$ where $a_0, \ldots, a_n$ are elements of $A$, by evaluating at $t$ of the composite 

$$\mathbf{Magma}(A + \{x_0, \ldots, x_n\}) \stackrel{\mathbf{Magma}(\phi)}{\to} \mathbf{Magma}(A) \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} A$$ 

where $\phi(x_i) = a_i$ and is elsewhere the identity. 

Then, we say $A$ is _functionally complete_ if every term $t \in A[X]$, viewed as a partial operation on $A$, is represented by some element in $A$. To be precise: for each term $t$ with $FV(t) \subseteq \{x_0, \ldots, x_n\}$, there exists an element $a \in A$ such that 

* For all $a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1} \in A$, $a a_0 \ldots a_{n-1}$ is defined; 

* For all $a_0, \ldots, a_n \in A$, $t[a_0/x_0, \ldots, a_n/x_n]$ is defined precisely when $a a_0 \ldots a_n$ is defined, and these two elements are equal. 

For example, if $k$, $s$ are elements which realize $A$ as a PCA, then $k$ represents the term $t = x_0$ viewed as belonging to $\mathbf{Magma}(A + \{x_0, x_1\})$, and $s$ represents the term $(x_0 x_2)(x_1 x_2)$ viewed as belonging to $\mathbf{Magma}(A + \{x_0, x_1, x_2)\}$.

###### Theorem 
A partial combinatory algebra is functionally complete. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
The idea is to simulate $\lambda$-abstraction $\lambda x. t$, where $x \in X$ is a variable and $t$ is a term, by induction on $t$. Indeed, given elements $k, s$ that realize $A$ as a PCA, put 

$$\array{
\lambda x. x & \coloneqq & s k k & \\
\lambda x. t & \coloneqq & k t & x \notin FV(t) \\
\lambda x. t t' & \coloneqq & s(\lambda x. t)(\lambda x. t')
}$$ 

One then proves equality of partial functions $(\lambda x. t)(a) = t[a/x]$, by induction on $t$. 
=-- 

For example, let us check that $s k k$ indeed represents the identity function $I$. This is trivial: we have, for any $a \in A$, equalities between defined terms 

$$s k k a = (k a)(k a) = a.$$

For another example, consider the second projection function, corresponding to $x_1 \in \mathbf{Magma}(A + \{x_0, x_1\})$. Thinking in terms of $\lambda$-terms, this is represented by $\lambda x. \lambda y. y = \lambda x. s k k = k(s k k)$, or $k I$. In other words,  

$$k I a b = ((k I) a) b = I b = b.$$ 

## Examples 

1. Suppose we have a coding (e.g., a G&ouml;del numbering) of all partial recursive functions of the form 
$$\mathbb{N}^k \to \mathbb{N}$$ 
(ranging over $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$) by elements of $\mathbb{N}$, and a coding of elements of $\mathbb{N}^k$ over all $k$ by elements of $\mathbb{N}$. Define a partial applicative structure  
$$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$$ 
where $p q = \{p\}([q])$ whenever the right side is defined, where $\{p\}$ is the $p^{th}$ partial recursive function and $[q]$ is the $q^{th}$ tuple. It may be checked that $k$ and $s$, defined extensionally in the obvious way, are partial recursive functions, so we get in this way a PCA. 

1. Suppose we have a [[cartesian closed category]] generated by an object $X$ such that $X \times X$ and $X^X$ are retracts of $X$. Then elements $1 \to X$ form a PCA, in fact a total combinatory algebra, where the applicative structure is 
$$X \times X \stackrel{r \times 1_X}{\to} X^X \times X \stackrel{eval}{\to} X$$ 
for some chosen retraction $r$. In other words, models of the untyped [[lambda calculus]] give PCA's.

## Realizability toposes 

From any PCA, a corresponding "realizability tripos" can be constructed, from which, in turn, a corresponding "realizability topos" can be constructed, as outlined in the article on [[tripos|triposes]].
