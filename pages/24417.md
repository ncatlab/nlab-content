## Definition

A **coherent product** on an [[inhabited set]] $Z$ is a [[binary function]] $k:Z \times Z \to \mathbb{C}$ of [[function of positive type|positive type]]. 

An inhabited set equipped with the structure of a coherent product is a **coherent space**

## Examples

* The inner product of every [[Euclidean space]] is a coherent product. 

## See also
