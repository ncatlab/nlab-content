## Idea

The concept of _support of a distribution_ is an evident generalization of [[support]] of a [[continuous functions]] as functions are generalized to [[distributions]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #SupportOfADistribution}
###### Definition
**(support of a distribution)**

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and let $\phi \colon C^\infty_c(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a [[distribution]]. Then the _support_ of $\phi$ is the [[subset]] $supp(\phi) \subset X$ of all those points $x \in X$ such that for every [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ the restricted distribution $\phi\vert_{U_x}$ is not the zero-distribution

$$
  supp(\phi) 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    x \in X \;\vert\; \underset{ \text{nbhd}\, U_x }{\forall}\left( \phi\vert_{U_x} \neq 0 \right)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

By construction, the support of a distribution $\phi$ according to def. \ref{SupportOfADistribution} is a [[closed subset]].
If it happens to be a [[compact space|compact]] subset, then the 
distribution is said to have _[[compact support]]_.

###### Remark

If a [[bump function]] $f \in C^\infty_c(X)$ has its ([[compact support|compact]]) support $supp(f)$ [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] from the support of $\phi$, then the [[evaluation]] vanishes:

$$
  supp(f) \cap supp(\phi) = \emptyset
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \phi(f) = 0
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and let $\phi \colon C^\infty_c(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a [[distribution]]. Then the _singular support_  $singsupp(\phi) \subset X$ is the [[subset]] of points such that for every [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ the restriction $\phi\vert_{U_x}$ is not represented by a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[density]].
