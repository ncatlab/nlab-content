## Idea

Given two [[vector bundles]] $V_1 \to X$ and $V_2 \to X$ over the same base space $X$, their _tensor product of vector bundles_ $V_1 \otimes V_2 \to X$ is the vector bundle over $X$ whose [[fiber]] over any point is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] (i.e. the [[tensor product of modules]]) of the respective fibers of $V_1$ and $V_2$.

The tensor product of vector bundles makes the category [[Vect(X)]] into a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal category]], in fact a [[distributive monoidal category]].

###### Definition
**(tensor product of [[topological vector bundles]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and let $E_1 \to X$ and $E_2 \to X$ be two [[topological vector bundles]] over $X$. 

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] with respect to which both vector bundles locally trivialize (this always exists: pick a [[local trivialization]] of either bundle and form the joint [[refinement]] of the respective [[open covers]] by [[intersection]] of their patches). Let 

$$
  \left\{
    (g_1)_{i j}
    \colon U_i \cap U_j \to GL(n_1)
  \right\}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{and}  
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left\{
    (g_2)_{i j}
    \colon
     U_i \cap U_j \longrightarrow GL(n_2)
  \right\}
$$

be the [[transition functions]] of these two bundles with respect to this cover.

For $i, j \in I$ write

$$
  \array{
    (g_i)_{i j} \otimes (g_2)_{i j}
    &\colon&
    U_i \cap U_j
      &\longrightarrow&
    GL(n_1 \cdot n_2)
  }
$$

be the pointwise [[tensor product of vector spaces]] of these transition functions

Then the _tensor product bundle_ $E_1 \oplus E_2$ is the one glued from this direct sum of the transition functions (by [this construction](topological+vector+bundle#TopologicalVectorBundleFromCechCocycle)):

$$
  E_1 \otimes E_2
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left(
    \left( \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \right)
    \times 
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \cdot n_2}
    \right)
  \right)/ \left( \left\{ (g_1)_{i j} \otimes (g_2)_{i j} \right\}_{i,j \in I} \right)
  \,.
$$
