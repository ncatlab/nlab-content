## Idea

Given two [[vector bundles]] $V_1 \to X$ and $V_2 \to X$ over the same base space $X$, their _tensor product of vector bundles_ $V_1 \otimes V_2 \to X$ is the vector bundle over $X$ whose [[fiber]] over any point is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] (i.e. the [[tensor product of modules]]) of the respective fibers of $V_1$ and $V_2$.

## Details

We discuss in detail the construction of the tensor product oof vector bundles as a construction in [[topological spaces]].

For all of the following the [[ground field]] $k$ may be taken to be the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ or the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, corresponding to [[real vector bundles]] and [[complex vector bundles]], respectively. 

Recall first how the [[topological space|topology]] on the total space of a [[vector bundle]] arises as the [[quotient topological space]] of the corresponding trivial bundle over an [[open cover]] quotiented by

###### Definition
**([[vector bundle]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], let $k$ be [[topological field]], and let  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]]. 

A _topological $k$-[[vector bundle]] of [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]] $n$ over $X$_  is

1. a [[topological space]] $E$;

1. a [[continuous function]] $p \colon E \to X$;

1. for each $x \in X$ the structure of a [[vector space]] on the [[pre-image]] $p^{-1}(\{x\})$ of the [[singleton set|singleton]] [[subset]] $\{x\} \subset X$ (the _[[fiber]]_ of the vector bundle over $x$)

such that 

1.  there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ 

1. and for each $i \in I$ a [[homeomorphism]]

   $$
     \phi_i \;\colon\; E|_{U_i} \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} U_i \times k^n
   $$

   from the restriction of $E$ to the open subset $U_i \subset X$ to the [[product topological space]] of $U_i$ with the canonical $n$-dimensional 

1. such that 

   1. \phi is a map over $U_i$, in that it makes [[fibers]] to fibers: $\phi_i(p^{-1}(x)) \subset \{x\} \times \mathbb{R}^n$

   1. \phi is a fiberwise $k$-[[linear map]].

Such an open cover is also called a _trivializing cover_ for the vector bundle, and the choice of homeomorphisms $\{\phi_i\}_{i \in I}$ is called a _[[local trivialization]]_.

This may equivalently but conveniently be stated a bit more [[category theory|category theoretically]] as follows:

A _topological $k$-vector bundle of rank $n$ over $X$_ is

1. an [[object]] $[E \overset{p}{\to} X]$ in the [[slice category]] of [[Top]] over $X$;

1. the structure of a $k_X$-[[module object]] on $[E \overset{p}{\to} X]$, 

   where $k_X \coloneqq [X \times k^n \overset{pr_1}{\to} X] \in Top_{/X}$ is regarded as a [[field]] [[internalization|internal]] to $Top_{/X}$ in the canonical way;

such that

1. there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$

   with [[disjoint union space]] to be denoted
   
   $$  
     \mathcal{U} \coloneqq \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
   $$

   equipped with the induced [[continuous function]]

   $$
     c \;\colon\; \mathcal{U} \longrightarrow X
   $$

1. there exists an [[isomorphism]] of $k_{\mathcal{U}}$-[[module objects]] in $Top_{/\mathcal{U}}$

   $$
     \phi \;\colon\; \mathcal{U} \times k \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} c^\ast E
   $$

   where

   $$
     c^\ast \;\colon\; Top_{/X} \longrightarrow Top_{/\mathcal{U}}
   $$

   is the [[pullback]] [[functor]] ([[base change]]) along the cover projection $c$;

In terms of [[diagrams]] in $Top$ this situation looks as follows:

  $$
    \array{
      \mathcal{U} \times k^n &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}&
      c^\ast E
        &\overset{(\phi_i)}{\longrightarrow}&
      E
      \\
      & {}_{\mathllap{pr_1}}\searrow&
      \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
      \\
      &&
      \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
      &\longrightarrow&
      X
    }
  $$

Observe that for $p \colon E \to X$ a vector bundle, we may recover $E$ from the data of the [[local trivialization]] as the [[quotient space]]

$$
  E 
   \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} \left( U_i \times k^n\right)
  \right)/(\sim_{g})
$$

where $\sim_g$ denotes the relation given by the [[transition functions]].

Hence let now $E_1, E_2$ be two $k$-vector bundles over $X$. We may always find an [[open cover]] such that both of them have a [[local trivialization]] over that cover. (Find trivializing open covers for either bundles and then form their joint refinement.) Hence we have then


$$
  E_1
   \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} \left( U_i \times k^{n_1}\right)
  \right)/(\sim_{(g_1)})
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  E_2
   \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} \left( U_i \times k^{n_2}\right)
  \right)/(\sim_{(g_2)})
  \,.
$$

With this the _tensor product_ of these two vector bundles is

$$
  E_1 \otimes E_2
   \coloneqq
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} \left( U_i \times (k^{n_1} \otimes_k k^{n_2}\right)
  \right)/(\sim_{(g_1 \otimes g_2)})
  \,.
$$
