Hi Victor, and welcome!

You added a note to the top of [[Categories and Sheaves]] that seemed to be more about explaining how you were editing the page just then than something that should actually be on the page itself.  So I moved it to [[latest changes]], which is where we normally tell people about what we\'ve done that they might want to know about.
