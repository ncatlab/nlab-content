## Idea

An __operator algebra__ is any subalgebra of the algebra of continuous [[linear operators]] on a [[topological vector space]], with composition as the multiplication. In most cases, the space is a separable [[Hilbert space]], and most attention historically has been paid to algebras of [[bounded linear operator]]s. The operator algebras themselves are often equipped with their own topologies (e.g. norm topology, weak topology, weak$^*$ topology and so on) and sometimes involution. __$C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]]__ are (in the complex case) norm-closed complex $*$-[[subalgebras]] of the algebra of the [[bounded linear operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]]. They can be however characterized structurally as a $*$-[[representation]] of a [[Banach algebra]] with involution satisfying some compatibility conditions; the latter could be called abstract $C^*$-algebras (or sometimes $B^*$-algebras). Every _commutative_ unital $C^*$-algebra can be realized as an algebra of functions on a Hausdorff compact space, which is obtained as its [[Gel'fand spectrum]].

Special class of $C^*$-algebras are __[[von Neumann algebra|von Neumann]]__ or $W^*$-algebras (see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra)), which are (in the complex case) _weakly closed_ (closed in the weak topology) $*$-subalgebras of the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. In structural theory, an important role among [[von Neumann algebra]]s is played by so-called [[von Neumann algebra factor|factor]]s, characterized by the property that their center is trivial ($1$-dimensional, consisting of "scalars"). 

Operator algebras play major roles in [[functional analysis]], [[representation theory]], [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[quantum field theory]]. 

## Topics of interest for the understanding of AQFT

This paragraph will collect some facts of interest for the aspects of [[AQFT]] in the nLab. Unless stated otherwise all operator algebras will be assumed to be unital, i.e. having an identiy denoted by $\mathbb{1}$.
