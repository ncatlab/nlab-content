## Idea
An __operator algebra__ is any subalgebra of the algebra of continuous linear operators on a [[topological vector space]], with composition as the multiplication. In most cases, the space is a separable [[Hilbert space]], and most attention historically has been paid to algebras of bounded linear operators. The operator algebras themselves are often equipped with their own topologies (e.g. norm topology, weak topology, weak$^*$ topology and so on) and sometimes involution. __$C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]]__ are (in the complex case) norm-closed complex $*$-[[subalgebras]] of the algebra of the bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. They can be however characterized structurally as a $*$-[[representation]] of a [[Banach algebra]] with involution satisfying some compatibility conditions; the latter could be called abstract $C^*$-algebras (or sometimes $B^*$-algebras). Every _commutative_ unital $C^*$-algebra can be realized as an algebra of functions on a Hausdorff compact space, which is obtained as its [[Gel'fand spectrum]].

Special class of $C^*$-algebras are __[[von Neumann algebra|von Neumann]]__ or $W^*$-algebras (see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra)), which are (in the complex case) _weakly closed_ (closed in the weak topology) $*$-subalgebras of the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. In structural theory, an important role among von Neumann algebras is played by so-called factors, characterized by the property that their center is trivial ($1$-dimensional, consisting of "scalars"). 

Operator algebras play major roles in [[functional analysis]], [[representation theory]], [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[quantum field theory]]. 

## Topics of interest for the understanding of AQFT
This paragraph will collect some facts of interest for the aspects of [[AQFT]] in the nLab. Unless stated otherwise all operator algebras will be assumed to be unital, i.e. having an identiy denoted by $\mathbb{1}$.

###States {#statesOfOperatorAlgebras}
The Heisenberg picture is sometimes formalized by describing the observables of a quantum system by an operator algebra, and the state of the system as a state of the algebra. The first "state" in the preceding sentence is the state the described physical system is in, the second one is the mathematical counterpart we are about to define, that inherited it's name from the physical concept.

The definition of a state relies on the notion of positivity of the elements of an operator algebra, for which we need the structure of a [[C-star algebra]].  

* Definition: An element A of an (abstract) $C*$-algebra is called **positive** if it is self-adjoint and its spectrum is contained in $[0, \infinity)$. We write $A \ge 0$ and say that the set of all positive operators is the positive cone (of a given $C*$-algebra).

Remark: This defintion is motivated by the Hilbert space situation, where an operator $A \in \mathcal{B} (\mathcal{H})$ is called positive if for every vector $x \in \mathcal{H}$ the inequality $ \langle x, Ax \rangle \ge 0$ holds. If the abstract $C^*$-algebra of the definition above is represented on a Hilbert space, then we see that by [function calculus] we can define a self adjoint operator $B$ by $B := f(A)$ with $f(t) := t^{1/2}$ and get  $ \langle x, Ax \rangle = \langle Bx, Bx \rangle \ge 0$. This shows that the positive elements of the abstract algebra, if represented on a Hilbert space, become positive operators as defined here in the Hilbert space setting.

* Definition: A linear functional $\rho$ of an $C*$-algebra is **positive** if $A \ge 0$ implies that  $\rho(A) \ge 0$.

* Definition: A **state** of an unital $C*$-algebra is linear functional $\rho$ such that $\rho$ is positive and $\rho(\mathbb{1}) = 1$.

Though the mathematical notion of state is already close to what physicists have in mind, they usually restrict the set of states further and consider normal states only. We let $\mathcal{R}$ be an $C*$-algebra and $\pi$ an representation of $\mathcal{R}$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.
 
Combined definition and theorem: A **normal state** $\rho$ is a state that satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions (this list is not complete, i.e. there are more equivalent characterizations of normal states):

* $\rho$ is weak-operator continuous on the unit ball of $\pi(\mathcal{R})$.

* $\rho$ is strong-operator continuous on the unit ball $\pi(\mathcal{R})$.

* $\rho$ is ultra-weak continuous.

* There is an operator A of trace class of $\mathcal{H}$ with tr(A) = 1 such that $\rho(\pi(R)) = tr(A \pi(R))$ for all $R \in \mathcal{R}$.

The last one is most frequently used by physicists, in that context the operator $A$ is also called a density matrix or density operator.

Sometimes the observables of a system are described by an abstract $C*$-algebra, in this case an important notion is the folium:

* Definition: The **folium** of a representation $\pi$ of an $C*$-algebra  $\mathcal{R}$ on a Hilbert space is the set of normal states of $\pi(\mathcal{R})$.

* Definition: A state $\rho$ of a representation is called a **vector state** if there is a $x \in \mathcal{H}$ such that $\rho(\pi(R)) = \langle \pi(R)x, x \rangle$ for all $R \in \mathcal{R}$.

* Theorem: Normal states are vector states if $\mathcal{R}$ is a von Neumann algebra with a separating vector. More precisely: Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a von Neumman algebra acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, let $\rho$ be a normal state of $\mathcal{R}$ and $x \in \mathcal{H}$ be a separating vector for $\mathcal{R}$, then there is a $y \in \mathcal{H}$ such that $\rho(R) = \langle Ry, y \rangle$ for all $R \in \mathcal{R}$.

Reference: This is theorem 7.2.3 in the book of Kadison and Ringrose.

The set of states of an $C*$-algebra is sometimes called the **state space**.

The state space is non-empty (define a state on the subalgebra $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{1}$ and extend it to the whole $C*$-algebra via the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]), convex and weak$^*$-compact, so it has extreme points. By the  [[Krein-Milman theorem]] (see Wikipedia: [Krein-Milman theorem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krein%E2%80%93Milman_theorem)) it is the weak$^*$-closure of it's extreme points.

* Definition: A **pure state** is a state that is an extreme point of the state space.

The term "pure" originates from the notion of [[entanglement]], a pure state is not a superposition of two distinct other states.
