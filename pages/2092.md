## Idea
An __operator algebra__ is any subalgebra of the algebra of continuous linear operators on a [[topological vector space]], with composition as the multiplication. In most cases, the space is a separable [[Hilbert space]], and most attention historically has been paid to algebras of [[bounded linear operator]]s. The operator algebras themselves are often equipped with their own topologies (e.g. norm topology, weak topology, weak$^*$ topology and so on) and sometimes involution. __$C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]]__ are (in the complex case) norm-closed complex $*$-[[subalgebras]] of the algebra of the [[bounded linear operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]]. They can be however characterized structurally as a $*$-[[representation]] of a [[Banach algebra]] with involution satisfying some compatibility conditions; the latter could be called abstract $C^*$-algebras (or sometimes $B^*$-algebras). Every _commutative_ unital $C^*$-algebra can be realized as an algebra of functions on a Hausdorff compact space, which is obtained as its [[Gel'fand spectrum]].

Special class of $C^*$-algebras are __[[von Neumann algebra|von Neumann]]__ or $W^*$-algebras (see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra)), which are (in the complex case) _weakly closed_ (closed in the weak topology) $*$-subalgebras of the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. In structural theory, an important role among [[von Neumann algebra]]s is played by so-called [[von Neumann algebra factor|factor]]s, characterized by the property that their center is trivial ($1$-dimensional, consisting of "scalars"). 

Operator algebras play major roles in [[functional analysis]], [[representation theory]], [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[quantum field theory]]. 

## Topics of interest for the understanding of AQFT
This paragraph will collect some facts of interest for the aspects of [[AQFT]] in the nLab. Unless stated otherwise all operator algebras will be assumed to be unital, i.e. having an identiy denoted by $\mathbb{1}$.

## References


There are a lot of textbooks about operator algebras, here are some examples:

The classic textbook is this:

* Kadison, Richard V.; Ringrose, John R.: "Fundamentals of the theory of operator algebras I" and II, (see [ZMATH] (http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/advanced/?q=an:0888.46039&format=complete)) for the first.

These have two accompanying volumes (same title, numbers III and IV) which contain complete solutions to the extensive list of excercises. Highly recommended.

One of the founders of the Tomito-Takesaki modular theory has recently published a three volume treatise in the Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences:
