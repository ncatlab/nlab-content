## Idea

The _Stern-Gerlach experiment_ showed that [[electrons]] are [[spinors]]. It was the first [[experimental observation]] of the elementary [[spin]] $\frac{1}{2}$ of [[fermions]]. 

## Implications

Via the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]/[[spin-statistics theorem]], this implies that [[wavefunctions]] depending on fermionic variable commute with each other only up to a sign, forming a  [[supercommutative superalgebra]]. This way the Stern-Gerlach experiment is ultimately the observation that physical reality is described by [[supergeometry]]. 


(Notice that there is [[supergeometry]] independently of [[supersymmetry]], which may or may not be present in addition).
