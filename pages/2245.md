## Definition

Given a [[algebraically closed field]] $k$, an __algebraic $k$-group__ is a [[group object]] in the category of $k$-[[algebraic variety|varieties]]. 



## Special cases

An algebraic $k$-group is *linear* if it is a [[Zariski topology|Zariski]]-closed subgroup of the [[general linear group]] $GL(n,k)$ for some $n$. 

Another important class are commutative algebraic $k$-groups whose underlying variety is [[projective variety|projective]], namely the *abelian varieties*; in dimension $1$ these are precisely the [[elliptic curve]]s. If $k$ is a [[perfect field]] and $G$ an algebraic $k$-group, the theorem of Chevalley says that there is a unique linear subgroup $H\subset G$ such that $G/H$ is an abelian variety.

The group objects in the category of [[algebraic schemes]] and [[formal scheme]]s are called (algebraic) [[group schemes]] and [[formal groups]], respectively. 

Among group schemes are 'the infinite-dimensional algebraic groups' of Shafarevich. 

An algebraic group scheme is *affine* if the underlying scheme is [[affine scheme|affine]]. 

Algebraic analogues of [[loop group]]s are in the category of [[ind-scheme]]s. All linear algebraic $k$-groups are affine. 

The category of affine group schemes is the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of commutative [[Hopf algebras]].

## Concrete examples

The [[affine line]] $\mathbb{A}^1$ comes canonically with the structure of a group under addtion: the [[additive group]] $mathbb{G}_a$.

The affine line without its origin, $\mathbb{A}^1 - \{0\}$ comes canonically with the structure of a group under multiplication: the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathbb{G}_m$.
