Given a field $k$, an __algebraic $k$-group__ is a group object in the category of $k$-[[algebraic variety|varieties]]. An algebraic $k$-group is *linear* if it is a Zariski-closed subgroup of the general linear group $GL(n,k)$ for some $n$. Another important class are commutative algebraic $k$-groups, whose underlying variety is projective, namely the *abelian varieties*; in dimension $1$ these are precisely the elliptic curves. If $k$ is a [[perfect field]] and $G$ an algebraic $k$-group, the theorem of Chevalley, says that there is a unique linear subgroup $H\subset G$ such that $G/H$ is an abelian variety.

The group objects in the category of algebraic schemes and formal schemes are called (algebraic) *group schemes* and *formal groups*, respectively. One should mention among gruop schemes 'the infinite-dimensional algebraic groups' of Shafarevich. An algebraic group scheme is *affine* if the underlying scheme is an [[affine|affine scheme]]. Algebraic analogues of loop groups are in the category of ind-schemes. All linear algebraic $k$-groups are affine. The category of affine group schemes is the opposite to the category of commutative [[Hopf algebras]].
