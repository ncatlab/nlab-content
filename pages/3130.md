## Idea

Traditionally, in the strict sense of the word, the _Chern character_ is a [[universal characteristic class]] of [[vector bundles]] or equivalently of their [[topological K-theory]] classes, which is a [[rational number|rational]] combination of all [[Chern classes]].

(This is a map from a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] of [[chromatic level]] 1 to chromatic level 0. More generally one can also consider [[higher chromatic Chern characters]] that take values not in [[ordinary cohomology]] but in some cohomology theory of higher [[chromatic level]]. See at _[[higher chromatic Chern character]]_ for more on this.)


This is a special case of the following more general construction ([[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology,and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 02, section 4.8]]):

for $E$ a [[spectrum]] [[Brown representability theorem|represening]] a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] there is a canonical [[localization of spectra|localization]] map

$$
  ch_E \;\colon\; E \longrightarrow E \wedge H\mathbb{R}
$$

to the [[smash product]] with the the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] over the [[real numbers]]. This represents the $E$-Chern character.



In the case that $E = $ [[KU]] this reproduces the traditional Chern character.

There are analogues in algebraic geometry (e.g. a Chern character between [[Chow groups]] and [[algebraic K-theory]]) and in [[noncommutative geometry]] (Chern-Connes character) where the role of usual cohomology is taken by some variant of cyclic cohomology.  


## For vector bundles and K-theory {#KTheory}

The classical theory of the Chern character applies to the [[spectrum]] of complex [[K-theory]], $E = KU$. In this case, the Chern character is made up from Chern classes: each characteristic class is by Chern-Weil theory in image of certain element in the Weil algebra via taking the class of evaluation at the [[curvature]] operator for some choice of a connection. Consider the symmetric functions in $n$ variables $t_1,\ldots, t_n$ and let the Chern classes of a complex vector bundle $\xi$ (representing a complex K-theory class) are $c_1,\ldots, c_n$. Define the formal power series 

$$
\phi = \phi^n(t_1,\ldots, t_n) = e^{t_1}+\ldots+e^{t_n}= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} (t_1^k+\ldots+t_n^k)
$$

Then $ch(\chi) = \phi(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$. 

Let us describe this a bit differently. The cocycle $H^0(X,KU)$ may be represented by a complex [[vector bundle]], and the image of this cocycle under the Chern-character is the class in even-graded real cohomology that is represented (under the [[deRham theorem]] isomorphism of deRham cohomology with real cohomology) by the even graded closed [[differential form]]


$$
 ch(\nabla) := \sum_{j \in \mathbb{N}}
   k_j
   tr( F_\nabla \wedge \cdots \wedge F_\nabla)
  \;\;
  \in \Omega^{2 \bullet}(X)
  \,,
$$

where

* $\nabla$ is any chosen [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the vector bundle;

* $F = F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(X,End(V))$ is the [[curvature]] of this connection;

* $k_j \in \mathbb{R}$ are normalization constants, $k_j = \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^j$;

* the trace of the wedge products produces the [[curvature characteristic form]]s.

The Chern character applied to the [[Whitney sum]] of two vector bundles is a sum of the Chern characters for the two: $ch(\xi\oplus \eta) = ch(\chi)+ch(\eta)$ and it is multiplicative under the tensor product of vector bundles: $ch(\xi\otimes\eta)=ch(\chi)ch(\eta)$. Therefore we get a ring homomorphism. 

## General theory

### The fundamental cocycle

The [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H(-,E)\otimes \mathbb{R}
  \;\;
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \;\;
  H(-,(\pi_* E)\otimes \mathbb{R})
$$

that defines the Chern-character map is induced by a canonical cocycle on the [[spectrum]] $E$ that is called the **fundamental cocycle**.

This is described for instance in section [4.8, page 47](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0211/0211216v2.pdf#page=47) of Hopkins-Singer [[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology,and M-Theory]].

## Properties

### Push-forward

The behaviour of the Chern-character under [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] along [[proper maps]] is described by the [[Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem]].
