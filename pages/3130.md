## Idea

The **Chern character** of a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is a canonical morphism from the generalized cohomology to ordinary ([[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg Mac-Lane]]) real cohomology. When thought of in the refinement to [[differential cohomology]] and thinking of a cocycle in differential cohomology as a generalization of a [[connection on a bundle]], the Chern-character is the map that sends a generalized connection to its [[curvature characteristic form]].


More in detail, for every [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory given by a [[spectrum]] $E$, there is a canonical [[natural isomorphism]] from the rationalized $E$-cohomology to ordinary (Eilenberg-MacLane) cohomology with coefficients in the rationalized [[homotopy group]]s of $E$:

$$
  H(-,E)\otimes \mathbb{R}
  \;\;
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \;\;
  H(-,(\pi_* E)\otimes \mathbb{R})
  \,.
$$

So rationally, every generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology is ordinary (Eilenberg-MacLane) cohomology. Hence every generalized (ES-)cohomology theory has a canonical morphism to ordinary real cohomology

$$
  ch
  :
  H(-,E) 
  \;\;
  \to 
  \;\;
  H(-,E)\otimes \mathbb{R} 
  \;\;
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} 
  \;\;
  H(-,\pi_* E \otimes \mathbb{R})
  \,.
$$

In the case that $E = KU$ is the [[K-theory]] spectrum, this morphism is classically known as the **Chern character**. Generalizing from this example, the term "Chern character" is sometimes used also for the general case. 

There are analogues in algebraic geometry (e.g. a Chern character between the Chow groups and the algebraic K-theory) and noncommutative geometry (Chern-Connes character) where the role of usual cohomology is taken by some variant of cyclic cohomology.  


## For vector bundles and K-theory {#KTheory}

The classical theory of the Chern character applies to the [[spectrum]] of complex [[K-theory]], $E = KU$. In this case, the Chern character is made up from Chern classes: each characteristic class is by Chern-Weil theory in image of certain element in the Weil algebra via taking the class of evaluation at the [[curvature]] operator for some choice of a connection. Consider the symmetric functions in $n$ variables $t_1,\ldots, t_n$ and let the Chern classes of a complex vector bundle $\xi$ (representing a complex K-theory class) are $c_1,\ldots, c_n$. Define the formal power series 

$$
\phi = \phi^n(t_1,\ldots, t_n) = e^{t_1}+\ldots+e^{t_n}= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} (t_1^k+\ldots+t_n^k)
$$

Then $ch(\chi) = \phi(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$. 

Let us describe this a bit differently. The cocycle $H^0(X,KU)$ may be represented by a complex [[vector bundle]], and the image of this cocycle under the Chern-character is the class in even-graded real cohomology that is represented (under the [[deRham theorem]] isomorphism of deRham cohomology with real cohomology) by the even graded closed [[differential form]]


$$
 ch(\nabla) := \sum_{j \in \mathbb{N}}
   k_j
   tr( F_\nabla \wedge \cdots \wedge F_\nabla)
  \;\;
  \in \Omega^{2 \bullet}(X)
  \,,
$$

where

* $\nabla$ is any chosen [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the vector bundle;

* $F = F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(X,End(V))$ is the [[curvature]] of this connection;

* $k_j \in \mathbb{R}$ are normalization constants, $k_j = \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^j$;

* the trace of the wedge products produces the [[curvature characteristic form]]s.

The Chern character applied to the [[Whitney sum]] of two vector bundles is a sum of the Chern characters for the two: $ch(\xi\oplus \eta) = ch(\chi)+ch(\eta)$ and it is multiplicative under the tensor product of vector bundles: $ch(\xi\otimes\eta)=ch(\chi)ch(\eta)$. Therefore we get a ring homomorphism. 

## General theory

### The fundamental cocycle

The [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H(-,E)\otimes \mathbb{R}
  \;\;
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \;\;
  H(-,(\pi_* E)\otimes \mathbb{R})
$$

that defines the Chern-character map is induced by a canonical cocycle on the [[spectrum]] $E$ that is called the **fundamental cocycle**.
