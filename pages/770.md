A **homotopy 1-type** is a [[topological space]] (or a [[simplicial set]] or other model for a [[homotopy type]]) all of whose [[homotopy group]]s $\pi_n$ are trivial for $n\gt 1$.  See [[homotopy n-type]] for generalities.

A connected homotopy 1-type is completely determined by the one [[group]] $\pi_1$; a homotopy 1-type with $\pi_1 = G$ is called an [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane space]] and written $K(G,1)$.  A general homotopy 1-type is then a disjoint union of such $K(G,1)$s.

Alternatively, one can describe the [[classifying space]] $B G$ of a [[groupoid]] as the geometric realisation of its simplicial nerve $nerve(G)$ (see [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]) and this shows how groupoids realise 1-types. 

This is relevant to the [[van Kampen theorem]] for the fundamental groupoid, which shows how the algebra of groupoids models the gluing of spaces. The general result for non-connected spaces is possible because groupoids model homotopy 1-types, having structure in dimensions 0 and 1. 

Moreover, every continuous map between $K(G,1)$s is induced by a group homomorphism, and every homotopy is induced by a conjugation.  In fact one can show that the $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] of homotopy 1-types is equivalent to the 2-category [[Grpd]] of [[groupoid]]s, where we identify $K(G,1)$ with the one-object groupoid corresponding to $G$ (sometimes written $B G$).
