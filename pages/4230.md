An __oscillation__ is a periodic motion. In other words it is a solution of the equations of motion which is a periodic function of time with a fixed period $T$. One also talks about slight generalizations of this definition, like damped oscillations and so on. 
A [[wave]] is a transportation of oscillations in medium, in other words a disturbance of a medium periodic in time (for fixed point) and propagation in space.

Cf. [[quasinormal mode]].
