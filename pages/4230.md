
An __oscillation__ is a periodic motion. In other words it is a solution of [[equations of motion]] that is a [[periodic function]] of [[time]] with a fixed period $T$. One also talks about slight generalizations of this definition, like [[damping|damped]] oscillations and so on.

A [[wave]] is a transportation of oscillations in medium, in other words a disturbance of a medium periodic in time (for a fixed point) and propagation in [[physical space]].

Cf. [[quasinormal mode]].
