I am an italian PhD; it's difficult to summarize my interests, but since I discovered the nlab three years ago I lurk it almost everyday, so they are basically modeled on the topics encountered here: Category Theory to understand Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy.

I'm a former student of [[Domenico Fiorenza]]. I owe him my mathematical everything.

I've been a postdoc in all these places:

* University of Western Ontario, (CA)
* Masaryk University (CZ)
* Max Planck Institute for Mathematics (D)
* Center of Mathematics, University of Coimbra (PT)


Here's a list of the papers I've written: [link](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Loregian%2C+F)
