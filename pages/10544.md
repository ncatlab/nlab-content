I am an italian PhD; it's difficult to summarize my interests, but since I discovered the nlab three years ago I lurk it almost everyday, so they are basically modeled on the topics encountered here: Category Theory to understand Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy.

I'm a former student of [[people:Domenico Fiorenza]]. I owe him my mathematical everything.

I am currently a postdoc at Masaryk University (Brno)
