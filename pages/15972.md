[[!redirects derived microlocalization]]

## Idea

[[Microlocalization]] is a tool to study the propagation of singularities of solutions of partial differential systems, in order to study pullbacks of solutions of differential systems (which generalize products of distributions) and prove [[index theorems]].
Derived microlocalization is an adaptation of the theory of microlocalization to the setting of derived [[global analytic geometry]].

## Motivation for a derived notion of microlocalization

In non-smooth situations, the usual normal and conormal bundle used in classical microlocalization is not well behaved, and one needs to take derived versions of them. Moreover, to study [[global analytic index theory]], one needs a formulation of the theory of microlocalization in terms of derived loop stacks, in order to work out a cyclic and Hochshild version of index theorems (similar to the one developed by Kashiwara and Schapira in the [[microlocal formulation of index theory]]) that works on an arbitrary (e.g. integral) basis.

## Construction of derived microlocalization

[[Microlocalization]] in derived geometry involves the proper definition of the deformation to the normal bundle of a closed embedding $Y\subset X$ of global analytic spaces (or even stacks), which is given by the following simple construction.
The space of paths on $X$ based on $Y$ is the groupoid acting on $Y$ given by
$$P_Y X:=\{f\in \Hom(\Delta^1,X),\;f(0)\in Y,\;f(1)\in Y\}.$$
More concretely, this is given by the homotopy pullback
$$
\array{
    P_Y X &\to& \Hom(\Delta^1,X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ev_0\times ev_1}}
    \\
    Y\times Y &\to& X\times X
}
$$
Remark that the natural projection $P_Y X\to Y\times Y$ makes $P_Y X$ a groupoid (of paths in $X$) acting on $Y$. In the case of the diagonal immersion $Y=M\hookrightarrow M\times M=X$, we get
$$P_Y X\cong LX:=\Hom(S^1,X).$$
There is a natural projection $p:P_Y X\to \Hom(\Delta^1,X)\sim X$ and $P_Y X$ is equiped with the natural structure of a groupoid acting on $Y$ through the projection $P_Y X\to Y\times Y$.
A more explicit description of the loop space (that is obtained by using the homotopy $\Delta^1\sim \Delta^0$) is given by the homotopy pullback
$$L_Y X=Y\times^h_X Y,$$
which clearly has an interesting meaning only in the setting of derived geometry.


Over a base field of characteristic $0$, the [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem]] implies that $P_Y X\cong T_Y[-1]X$ and $LX\cong T[-1]X$.

The deformation to the normal bundle in strict derived global analytic geometry is then simply given by the formula (with $D^1=\mathbb{M}(R\{X\}^\dagger)$ for $R$ the base ind-Banach ring)
$$
\widetilde{L_Y X}:=\{f\in \Hom_{D^1}(\Delta^1\times D^1,X\times D^1),\;f(0,0)\in Y,\; f(1,0)\in Y,\;f(x,t)\in (X\backslash Y)\forall t\neq 0\}.
$$
More concretely (maybe false, but to be corrected), this is given by the homotopy pullback (where $U(1)=\mathbb{M}(R\{X,Y\}^\dagger/(XY-1))$)
$$
\array{
    \widetilde{L_Y X} &\to& \Hom_{D^1}(\Delta^1\times D^1,X\times D^1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ev_{(0,0)}\times ev_{(1,0)}\times \ev_{(-,U(1))}}}
    \\
    Y\times \Hom(\Delta^1\times U(1),(X\backslash Y)) &\stackrel{\Delta\times i}{\to}& X\times X\times \Hom(\Delta^1\times U(1),X)
}
$$
It has an evident natural projection $t:\widetilde{L_Y X}\to D^1$.
