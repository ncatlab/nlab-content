[[!redirects derived microlocalization]]

## Idea

[[Microlocalization]] is a tool to study the propagation of singularities of solutions of partial differential systems, in order to study pullbacks of solutions of differential systems (which generalize products of distributions) and prove [[index theorems]].

## Motivation for a derived notion of microlocalization

In non-smooth situations, the usual normal and conormal bundle used in classical microlocalization is not well behaved, and one needs to take derived versions of them. Moreover, to study [[global analytic index theory]], one needs a formulation of the theory of microlocalization in terms of derived loop stacks, in order to work out a cyclic and Hochshild version of index theorems (similar to the one developed by Kashiwara and Schapira in the Hochshild context) that works on an arbitrary (e.g. integral) basis.

## Construction of derived microlocalization

[[Microlocalization]] in derived geometry involves the proper definition of the deformation to the normal bundle of a closed embedding $Y\subset X$ of global analytic spaces (or even stacks), which is given by the following simple construction.
The space of paths on $X$ based on $Y$ is the groupoid acting on $Y$ given by
$$P_Y X:=\{f\in \Hom(\Delta^1,X),\;f(0)\in Y,\;f(1)\in Y\}.$$
More concretely, this is given by the homotopy pullback
$$
\array{
    P_Y X &\to& \Hom(\Delta^1,X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ev_0\times ev_1}}
    \\
    Y\times Y &\to& X\times X
}
$$
Remark that the natural projection $P_Y X\to Y\times Y$ makes $P_Y X$ a groupoid (of paths in $X$) acting on $Y$. One may pull it back along the diagonal $\Delta:Y\hookrightarrow Y\times Y$ to get the loop space
$$L_Y X:=\{f\in \Hom(\Delta^1,X),\;f(0)=f(1)\in Y\}.$$
There is a natural projection $\tau:L_Y X\to Y$.
A more explicit description of the loop space (that is obtained by using the homotopy $\Delta^1\sim \Delta^0$) is given by the homotopy pullback
$$L_Y X=Y\times^h_X Y,$$
which clearly has an interesting meaning only in the setting of derived geometry.

The deformation to the normal bundle in strict derived global analytic geometry is then simply given by the formula (with $D^1=\mathbb{M}(R\{X\}^\dagger)$ for $R$ the base ind-Banach ring)
$$
\widetilde{L_Y X}:=\{f\in \Hom_{D^1}(\Delta^1\times D^1,X\times D^1),\;f(0,0)=f(1,0)\in Y,\;f(x,t)\in (X\backslash Y)\forall t\neq 0\}.
$$
More concretely (maybe false, but to be corrected), this is given by the homotopy pullback (where $U(1)=\mathbb{M}(R\{X,Y\}^\dagger/(XY-1))$)
$$
\array{
    \widetilde{L_Y X} &\to& \Hom_{D^1}(\Delta^1\times D^1,X\times D^1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ev_{(0,0)}\times ev_{(1,0)}\times \ev_{(-,U(1))}}}
    \\
    Y\times \Hom(\Delta^1\times U(1),(X\backslash Y)) &\stackrel{\Delta\times i}{\to}& X\times X\times \Hom(\Delta^1\times U(1),X)
}
$$
It has an evident natural projection $t:\widetilde{L_Y X}\to D^1$.
