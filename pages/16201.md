## Idea

In the context of [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]), _higher curvature corrections_ are modificatiosn of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] that include not just the linear appearance of the [[scalar curvature]] $R$ but higher scalar powers of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].

When viewing Einstein-Hilbert [[gravity]] as an [[effective field theory]] valid at low energy, then higher curvature corrections are precisely the terms that may appear at higher energy in pure gravity. Notably the effective field theories induced by [[string theory]] come with infinite towers of higher curvature correcitons.

In the context of [[cosmology]], higher curvature corrections are a candidate for the [[inflaton field]], see at _[[Starobinsky model of cosmic inflation]]_.
