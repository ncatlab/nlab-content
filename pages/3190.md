**Raoul Bott** (1923-â€“2005) was one of the great 20-th century topologists and geometers. Among famous works one should mention Bott periodicity theorem (of importance in K-theory), studies in Morse theory (including study of Bott-Morse functions), and the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem in geometric representation theory and study of fixed point (localization) formulas (Atiyah-Bott fixed point theorem).
