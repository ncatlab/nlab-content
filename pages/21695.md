## Idea

An indefinite integral is something less definite than a [[definite integral]].  Whereas a definite integral is typically some kind of number or other concrete quantity, an indefinite integral is typically another variable quantity of the same type as the integrand.

The term 'indefinite integral' is itself rather indefinite, having been used for a variety of slightly different concepts.  Both _semidefinite integrals_ and _antiderivatives_ are more precise versions of indefinite integrals.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] is basically the theorem that these two kinds of indefinite integral are essentially the same thing.


## Definitions and notation

To begin with, we will discuss the integration of [[real number|real]]-valued functions on the [[real line]], but much of this can be generalized to other contexts.  So let $f$ be a [[partial function]] from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$; typically, the domain of $f$ will be an [[interval]], but we do not require this.

If $a$ is a real number (usually in the domain of $f$, or at least a [[limit point]] of the domain), then the __semidefinite integral__ of $f$ from $a$ (or with __initial point__ $a$) is the function
$$ x \mapsto \int_a^x f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t .$$
(If $x \lt a$, then we must define $\int_a^x$ as $-\int_x^a$.)

The semidefinite integral is defined in terms of the definite integral.  We can use put names such as 'Riemann' and 'Lebesgue' between 'semidefinite' and 'integral' to specify a particular kind of definite integral to be used.  Note that the domain of the semidefinite integral is an interval owning $a$ and contained in the domain of $f$ (or at least in its closure if we allow [[improper integral]]s or integrating [[almost functions]]).  If we start by defining $f$ as an [[locally integrable function]] on a closed interval $I$ containing $a$, then the semidefinite integral will also have $I$ as its domain.

The value at $x$ of the semidefinite integral from $a$ may be denoted
$$ \int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x $$
for short.  Notice that this notation has no dummy variable; we only need to introduce the dummy variable $t$ to unfold the definition.  (Indeed, some writers will abuse notation, writing $\int_a^x f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ for the semidefinite integral.)  But as in $\mathrm{d}y/\mathrm{d}x$, the $x$ here is not a [[free variable]] either, since we cannot freely use substitution; it has to be viewed as [[variable quantity]] instead.  Rather, if you want to evaluate $\int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ when $x$ is some number $b$, then the notation for this is $\int_a^b f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$, not $\int_a f(b) \,\mathrm{d}b$ as it would be if $x$ were a free variable.

+-- {: .num_defn #semiIV}
If $a$ and $C$ are real numbers, with $a$ in (the closure of) the domain of $f$, then the __indefinite integral__ of $f$ from $a$ with __initial value__ $C$ is the function
$$ x \mapsto C + \int_a^x f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t .$$
We may write this value as $C + \int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ for short.
=--

This is only one of the meanings of 'indefinite integral', but it is the only one that doesn\'t have alternative unambiguous terminolgy.  Note that $C$ is the value of the indefinite integral at $a$; thus, $C$ is the initial value if $a$ is the initial point.  But for authors who use this concept, there is often no need to mention either $a$ or $C$ (and hence no terminology needed for them), because they are interested only in whether some other function $F$ is an indefinite integral of $f$, where $f$ is a locally integrable function on some closed interval.

+-- {: .num_defn #antider}
If $F$ is a partial function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, then $F$ is an __antiderivative__ of $f$ if $f$ is the [[derivative]] of $F$ on its domain:
$$ \forall\, x \in \dom F,\; f(x) = F'(x) .$$
A posteriori, $F$ must be [[differentiable function|differentiable]].
=--

This is the usual meaning of 'indefinite integral' in modern Calculus textbooks using the [[Riemann integral]], especially when the domain of $f$ is an interval.

+-- {: .num_defn #almostantider}
If $F$ is a Lebesgue-measurable [[almost function]] from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, then $F$ is an __almost antiderivative__ of $f$ if $f$ the derivative of $F$ [[almost everywhere]]:
$$ \operatorname{ess}\forall\, x \in [a,b],\; f(x) = F'(x) .$$
We are especially interested in the case where $F$ is [[absolutely continuous function|absolutely continuous]].
=--

This is not standard terminology, but it fits in well with other 'almost' terminology in [[measure theory]].  This is a common meaning of 'indefinite integral' when using the [[Lebesgue integral]].


## Properties

The main property linking the different kinds of indefinite integral is the _[[fundamental theorem of calculus]]_ (FTC).  For various definitions of integral, one can prove that every semidefinite integral, or more generally any indefinite integral, is an antiderivative; and that every antiderivative, or more generally every almost antiderivative, is an indefinite integral; possibly with technical conditions (depending on the type of integral concerned) such as differentiability or absolute continuity.  See that article for details.

Indefinite integrals provide solutions to [[differential equations]].  Of course, the definition of an antiderivative is that is the solution to a particularly simple differential equation.  Employing the FTC, we see that the indefinite integrals are the solutions to the corresponding initial-value problems.  Specifically, the solution to
$$ F'(x) = f(x),\; F(a) = C $$
is the indefinite integral of $f$ with initial point $a$ and initial value $C$:
$$ F(x) = C + \int_a f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x .$$


## Higher dimensions

If we think of the [[real line]] as the prototypical $1$-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]] and $f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x$ as a [[differential form]] on that manifold, then we can try to generalize this to other [[exterior differential forms]], generalizing the FTC to the [[Stokes theorem]].  It\'s clear what an antiderivative is in this context: $\alpha$ is an antiderivative of $\omega$ iff $\omega$ is the [[exterior derivative]] of $\alpha$.  On a [[smooth manifold]], we know what 'almost' means and so can also define almost antiderivatives.  However, it\'s less clear what a semidefinite integral or indefinite integral should be.

When $\omega$ is a (partial) exterior $1$-form on a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $P$ is a point in its domain, then we can define the value of the semidefinite integral of $\omega$ with initial point $P$ to be the integral along a straight line segment from $P$; the domain is the largest [[star-convex set]] radiating from $P$ on which $\omega$ is locally integrable.  If we define an indefinite integral as a semidefinite integral plus a constant initial value, then every antiderivative of $\omega$ on a star-convex set is an indefinite integral.  Conversely, every indefinite integral is an antiderivative if and only if $\omega$ is closed.  This can perhaps be generalized to [[Riemannian manifolds]] by considering integrals along [[geodesics]]; although the geodesic between two points is not always unique (even when it exists), it is unique on a sufficiently small (and often quite large) neighbourhood.  (For example, on a [[sphere]], as long as $\omega$ is integrable, we can define the indefinite integral this way at every point except the one directly opposite the initial point.)

On a more general manifold, we need a definition of semidefinite integral that exists much less often, but the value is that we no longer have to assume that $\omega$ is closed for half of the FTC; so this is probably the better definition.  So, if $\omega$ is a $1$-form on any differentiable manifold and $P$ is a point in its domain, then the semidefinite integral of $\omega$ with initial point $P$ is defined at another point $Q$ iff the integral of $\omega$ is the same along any path from $P$ to $Q$ (and then that integral is the value).  Then we can define an indefinite integral by adding a constant initial value.  It\'s still true that every indefinite integral is an antiderivative.  It's also true that every antiderivative is an indefinite integral, at least on a path-connected domain.  By definition, $\omega$ is exact iff an antiderivative exists.  But also, $\omega$ is closed iff it has an indefinite integral on a neighborhood of each point.  If the domain of $\omega$ is simply connected, then the is indefinite integral can be extended to the entire domain.
