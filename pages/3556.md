The general concept of hyperdoctrines, introduced by [[Lawvere]], does for predicate logics precisely what Lindenbaum algebras do for propositional logic, positioning the categorification of logic as a natural extension of the algebraicization of logic. As a specific example:

A first-order hyperdoctrine (with equality) consists of a category with finite products $C_T$, along with a functor $P : C_T^{op} \to HA_{AdjCyl}$ (where $HA_{AdjCyl}$ is the category whose objects are [[Heyting algebra]]s and whose morphisms are Heyting algebra morphisms with left and right adjoints) such that the following [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] is satisfied: for every object $A$, the left/right adjoints to $P(\pi)$ for the projections $\pi : A \times - \to -$ comprise a natural transformation from $P(A \times -)$ to $P(-)$ (that is, the left adjoints yield a natural transformation, and so do the right adjoints).

With this, we have enough structure to interpret multi-sorted first-order intuitionistic logic with equality, taking the objects of $C_T$ to be sorts and its morphisms to be terms, $P$ to assign to each sort the [[Lindenbaum algebra]] of predicates upon that sort, and the left and right adjoints to $P$ to provide existential and universal quantification, respectively, with the existence of the further adjoints providing the ability to interpret equality.

There are, of course, many variants on this, corresponding straightforwardly to modifications of the kind of logic one wishes to represent. For instance, to represent specifically classical logic, one should use [[Boolean algebras]] instead of [[Heyting algebras]]. To represent first-order logic without equality, one should no longer require that every morphism in the range of $P$ have left and right adjoints, but rather only those given by the natural transformations yielding the quantifiers. Various higher-order constructs can be added by adding new ways of forming objects in $C_T$ (e.g., adding cartesian closedness). Etc.

One can even extend this into the realm not just of provability, but furthermore of proof theory, by taking the objects in the codomain of $P$ to be categories rather than mere [[preorder]]s (e.g., by using [[bicartesian closed category|bicartesian closed categories]] rather than [[Heyting algebra]]s); in this case, the objects in a category $P(\sigma)$ would still represent predicates on the sort $\sigma$, but the morphisms in $P(\sigma)$ would represent proofs (rather than mere provability) of entailments between these predicates, with the possibility that not all such proofs would be equal.
