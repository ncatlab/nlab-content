## Idea

**Disjunctive logic** is the [[internal logic]] of [[lextensive categories]].

## Definition

...

## Example

The (coherent) theory of (geometric) [[field|fields]] is obtained from the axioms for the algebraic theory of commutative unital rings by adding the sequents

$$(0=1)\vdash \bot\,\text{ (nontriviality) and }\,\top \vdash_x ((x=0) \vee
((\exists y)(xy=1)))\quad.$$

Since inverse elements in a commutative ring are unique when they exist the second sequent involves a legitimate existential quantification plus a legitimate disjunction (due to the nontriviality) whence the resulting theory is (finitary) disjunctive.

## References

The main reference on disjunctive logic is Johnstone ([1979](#Johnstone79)) which was inspired by a non-syntactic concept of [[Yves Diers]]. The [elephant](#Johnstone02) has some additional cursory remarks. Freyd ([2002](#Freyd02)) gives disjunctive logic a short treatment under the name 'alternating logic' and discusses the [[real closed field|theory of real closed fields]] as an example. Barr and Wells ([1985](#BarrWells85)) discuss the corresponding class of sketches without mentioning the syntactic side.
