## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]] or $k$-[[module]], a _quadratic form_ on $V$ is a map

$$
  q\colon V \to k
$$

such that there is a [[bilinear form]] $\langle -,- \rangle\colon V \otimes V \to k$ with $q(v) = \langle v,v\rangle$.


## Quadratic refinement

Notice that we recover $\langle -,-\rangle$ up to a multiple of 2 from its qudratic form

$$
  2 \langle v,w\rangle = 
  q(v + w) - q(v) - q(w) + q(0)
  \,.
$$

A function $q'\colon V \to k$ (not necessarily bilinear) for which this equation holds _without_ the factor of 2, 

$$
  \langle v,w\rangle = 
  q'(v + w) - q'(v) - q'(w) + q(0)
  \,,
$$

then $q'$ is called a **quadratic refinement** of $\langle -,-\rangle$. This is nontrivial when 2 is not invertible in $k$.
