### Idea

Model theory of fields is a branch of [[model theory]] dedicated to study of (axiomatic, mainly first order) theories (in the sense of logic) which are dedicated to [[field]]s and, in more recently, to [[differential field]]s. 

### Basic theories of fields

First of all there is the __theory of fields__, which is a first order theory with equality in the language of rings $\{+, -, .,0,1\}$ and whose axioms are axioms of commutative integral domains together with an axiom
$$
 (\forall x)(x\neq 0\implies (\exists y)(x\cdot y = 1))
$$

Then there are more specific theories, e.g. the __theory of algebraically closed fields__ ACF and the __theory of [[real closed field]]s__ RCF. 

ACF has quantifier elimination and is model complete.
