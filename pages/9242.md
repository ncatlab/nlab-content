## Idea

In [[physics]] the part of the [[action functional]] of a [[theory (physics)|theory]] which describes the [[dynamics]] of  [[free fields]] without [[interaction]] is called the _kinetic action_.

The [[Legendre transform]] of the kinetic action is the _[[kinetic energy]]_ ([[Dirichlet energy]]).
