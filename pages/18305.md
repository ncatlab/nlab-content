## Idea

For $X$ a suitable [[space]] then a [[vector bundle]] over $X$ is called _trivial_ if there is no twist in how the [[fibers]] vary over it. 

## Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then a [[topological vector bundle]] $E \to X$ over a [[topological field]] $k$ is called _trivial_ if its total space is the [[product topological space]]

$$
  E = X \times k^n \overset{pr_1}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

with the [[topological vector space]] $k^n$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

An [[isomorphism]] of vector bundles over $X$ of the form 

$$
  E \longrightarrow X \times \mathbb{R}^n
$$

is called a _trivialization_ of $E$. If $E$ admits such an isomorphis, then it is called a _trivializable vector bundle._
