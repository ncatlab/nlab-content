## Idea

An _end_ is a special kind of [[limit]] over a [[functor]] of the form $F : C^{op} \times C \to D$ (sometimes called a _bifunctor_).

If we think of such a functor in the sense of [[profunctor]]s as encoding a left and right [[action]] on the object

$$
  \prod_{c \in C} F(c,c)
$$

then the _end_ of the functor picks out the universal [[subobject]] on which the left and right action coincides.  Dually, the _coend_ of $F$ is the universal quotient of $\coprod_{c \in C} F(c,c)$ that forces the two actions of $F$ on that object to be equal.

A classical example of an _end_ is the $V$-object of [[natural transformations]] between $V$-[[enriched functors]] in [[enriched category theory]].  Perhaps the most common way in which ends and coends arise is through homs and tensor products of (generalized) modules, and their close cousins, weighted limits and weighted colimits. These concepts are fundamental in enriched category theory. 



## Definition

### In ordinary category theory

In ordinary [[category theory]], given a [[functor]] $F: C^{op} \times C \to X$, an __end__ of $F$ in $X$ is an object $e$ of $X$ equipped with a [[universal construction|universal]] [[extranatural transformation]] from $e$ to $F$. This means that given any extranatural transformation from an object $x$ of $X$ to $F$, there exists a unique map $x \to e$ which respects the extranatural transformations. 

In more detail: the end of $F$ is traditionally denoted $\int_{c: C} F(c, c)$, and the components of the universal extranatural transformation, 
$$\pi_c: \int_{c: C} F(c, c) \to F(c, c)$$ 
are called the _projection maps_ of the end. Then, given any extranatural transformation with components 
$$\theta_c: x \to F(c, c),$$ 
there exists a unique map $f: x \to e$ such that 
$$\theta_c = \pi_c f$$ 
for every object $c$ of $C$.

The notion of __coend__ is dual to the notion of end.  The coend of $F$ is written $\int^{c: C} F(c, c)$, and comes equipped with a universal extranatural transformation with components
$$\iota_c \colon F(c,c) \to \int^c F(c,c)$$


### In enriched category theory 

There is a definition of _end_ in [[enriched category theory]], as follows. 

#### End of $V$-valued functors 

Let $V$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]], let $C$ be a $V$-[[enriched category]], and let $F: C^{op} \otimes C \to V$ be a $V$-[[enriched functor]]. 

Then in particular there is a covariant [[action]] of $C$ on $F$, with components
$$\lambda_{c, d, e}: F(c, d) \otimes C(d, e) \to F(c, e),$$
[where $C(d, e)$ is customary notation for the enriched hom $\hom_C(d, e)$ of $C$ in $V$], and a contravariant action of $C$ on $F$, with components
$$\rho_{c, d, e}: F(d, e) \otimes C(c, d) \to F(c, e).$$ 

In detail, the covariant action is the [[adjunct]] of the morphism 

$$(F(c,-) : C(d,e) \to [F(c,d), F(c,e)]) \in Hom_V(C(d,e),[F(c,d), F(c,e)])
$$ 

under the [[closed monoidal category|Hom-adjunction]] 

$$
Hom_V(C(d,e),[F(c,d), F(c,e)]) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Hom_V(C(d,e)\otimes F(c,d),F(c,e))
$$ 

in $V$. Similarly for the contravariant action.


A $V$- **extranatural transformation**
$$\theta: v \stackrel{\bullet}{\to} F$$ 
from $v$ to $F$ consists of a family of arrows in $V$, 
$$\theta_c: v \to F(c, c),$$ 
indexed over objects $c$ of $C$, such that for every pair of objects $(c, d)$ in $V$, the composites of (1) and (2) agree: 
$$v \otimes C(c, d) \stackrel{\theta_c \otimes 1}{\to} F(c, c) \otimes C(c, d) \stackrel{\lambda_{c, c, d}}{\to} F(c, d) \qquad (1)$$ 
$$v \otimes C(c, d) \stackrel{\theta_d \otimes 1}{\to} F(d, d) \otimes C(c, d) \stackrel{\rho_{c, d, d}}{\to} F(c, d) \qquad (2)$$

A $V$-enriched **end** of $F$ is an object $\int_{c: C} F(c, c)$ of $V$ equipped with a $V$-extranatural transformation 
$$\pi: \int_{c: C} F(c, c) \stackrel{\bullet}{\to} F$$ 
such any $V$-extranatural transformation $\theta$ from $v$ to $F$ is obtained by pulling back the components of $\pi$ along $f: v \to \int_{c: C} F(c, c)$, for some unique map $f$. That is,
$$\theta_c = \pi_c f$$ 
for all objects $c$ of $C$. 


#### End of $C$-valued functors for $C \in V\Cat$ 

If $X$ is any $V$-enriched category and $F: C^{op} \otimes C \to X$ is a $V$-enriched functor, then the **end** of $F$ in $X$ is, if it exists, an object $\int_{c: C} F(c, c)$ of $X$ that [[representable functor|represents]] the functor

$$
\int_{c: C} X(-,F(c,c))\,.
$$

That means that the $\int_{c: C} F(c,c)$ comes equipped with an $Ob(C)$-indexed family of arrows

$$
\pi_c: I \to X(\int_{c: C} F(c, c), F(c, c))
$$ 

in $V$, such that for every object $x$ of $X$, the family 
of maps 

$$
X(x, \pi_c): X(x, \int_{c: C} F(c, c)) \to X(x, F(c, c))
$$ 

are the projection maps realizing $X(x, \int_{c: C} F(c, c))$ as the corresponding end $\int_{c: C} X(x, F(c, c))$ in $V$. 


#### End as an equalizer

##### Ordinary ends as equalizers

Now we motivate and define the _end_ in [[enriched category theory]] in terms of [[equalizers]].

Recall from the discussion at the end of [[limit]] that the [[limit]] over an (ordinary, i.e. not enriched) [[functor]]

$$
  F : C^{op} \to Set
$$

is given by the [[equalizer]] of 

$$
  \prod_{c \in Obj(C)}
  F(c)
  \stackrel{\prod_{f \in Mor(c)} (F(f) \circ p_{t(f)}) }{\to}  
  \prod_{f \in Mor(C)}
  F(s(f))
$$

and

$$
  \prod_{c \in Obj(C)}
  F(c)
  \stackrel{\prod_{f \in Mor(c)} (p_{s(f)}) }{\to}  
  \prod_{f \in Mor(C)}
  F(s(f))  
  \,.
$$

If we want to generalize an expression like this to [[enriched category theory]] the explicit indexing over the set of morphisms has to be replaced by something that makes sense in an [[enriched category]]. 

To that end, observe that we have a canonical isomorphism (of sets, still)

$$
  \prod_{{(c_1 \stackrel{f}{\to} c_2)} \in Mor(C)} F(c_1)
  \simeq
  \prod_{c_1,c_2 \in Obj(C)} F(c_1)^{C(c_1,c_2)}
  \,.
$$

If we write for the [[hom-set]] instead

$$
 [C(c_1,c_2), F(c_1)] := F(c_1)^{C(c_1,c_2)}
$$ 

with $[-,-]$ the [[internal hom]] in [[Set]], then the expression starts to make sense in any $V$-[[enriched category]].

Still equivalently but suggestively rewriting the above, we now obtain the limit over $F$ as the [[equalizer]] of

$$
  \prod_{c \in Obj(C)}
  F(c)
  \stackrel{\stackrel{\rho}{\to}}{\stackrel{\lambda}{\to}}  
  \prod_{c_1,c_2 \in Obj(C)}
  [C(c_1,c_2),F(c_1)]
  \,,
$$

where in components

$$
  \rho_{c_1, c_2} : F(c_1) \to [C(c_1,c_2), F(c_1)]
$$

is the [[adjunct]] of

$$
  C(c_1, c_2) \to * \to [F(c_1), F(c_1)]
$$

(with the last map the [[adjunct]] of $Id_{F(c_1)}$) and where 

$$
  \lambda_{c_1, c_2} : F(c_2) \to [C(c_1,c_2), F(c_1)]
$$

is the [[adjunct]] of

$$
  F_{c_1, c_2} : C(c_1, c_2) \to [F(c_2), F(c_1)]
  \,.
$$

So for definiteness, the equalizer we are looking at is that of 

$$
  \rho := \prod_{c_1, c_2 \in C} \rho_{c_1,c_2}\circ pr_{F(c_1)}
$$

and

$$
  \lambda := \prod_{c_1, c_2 \in C} \lambda_{c_1,c_2}\circ pr_{F(c_2)}
$$

This way of writing the [[limit]] clearly suggests that it is more natural to have $\lambda$ and $\rho$ on equal footing. That leads to the following definition.


##### Enriched ends over $V$-valued functors as equalizers

For $V$ a [[symmetric monoidal category]], $C$ a $V$-[[enriched category]] and 
$F : C^{op} \times C \to V$ a 
$V$-[[enriched functor]],
the **end** of $F$ is the [[equalizer]]

$$
  \int_{c \in C}
  F(c,c)
  \to 
  \prod_{c \in Obj(C)}
  F(c,c)
  \stackrel{\stackrel{\rho}{\to}}{\stackrel{\lambda}{\to}}  
  \prod_{c_1,c_2 \in Obj(C)}
  [C(c_1,c_2),F(c_1,c_2)]\qquad\qquad (*)
$$

with $\rho$ in components given by

$$
  \rho_{c_1, c_2} : F(c_1,c_1) \to [C(c_1,c_2), F(c_1,c_2)]
$$

being the [[adjunct]] of

$$
  F(c_1,-) : C(c_1, c_2) \to [F(c_1,c_1), F(c_1,c_2)]
$$

and

$$
  \lambda_{c_1, c_2} : F(c_2,c_2) \to [C(c_1,c_2), F(c_1,c_2)]
$$

being the [[adjunct]] of

$$
  F(-,c_2) : C(c_1, c_2) \to [F(c_2,c_2), F(c_1,c_2)]
  \,.
$$

This definition manifestly exhibits the **end as the equalizer of the left and right action** encoded by the [[distributor]] $F$.

Dually, the coend of $F$ is the [[coequalizer]]

$$
\coprod_{c_1,c_2} C(c_2,c_1) \times F(c_1,c_2)\, \rightrightarrows\,
\coprod_c F(c,c)\,\to\,
\int^c F(c,c) \qquad \qquad (**)
$$

with the parallel morphisms again induced by the two actions of $F$.


#### End as a weighted limit 

The end for $V$-functors with values in $V$ serves, among other things, to define [[weighted limits]], and weighted limits in turn define ends of bifunctors with values in more general $V$-categories.

For $C$ and $D$ both $V$-categories and $F : C^\op \times C \to D$ an $V$-[[enriched functor]], the **end** of $F$ is the [[weighted limit]]

$$
  \int_{c \in C} F(c,c)
  :=
  lim^{Hom_C} F
  \,,
$$

where the right hand denotes the [[weighted limit]] over $F$ with weight $Hom_C : C^{op} \times C \to V$.

#### Connecting the two definitions

If $C$ is a $V$-category, then the hom functor $C(-,-) \colon C^{op} \times C \to V$ is the [[coequalizer]] (in fact a [[split coequalizer]]) in

$$
\coprod_{c,c'} C(-,c) \times C(c,c') \times C(c',-)
\,\rightrightarrows\,
\coprod_c C(-,c) \times C(c,-) \,\to\, C(-,-)
$$

This can be seen directly, or from the fact that the [[functor category]] $[C^{op} \times C, V]$ is the [[Eilenberg-Moore category|category of algebras]] for the [[monad]] on $[ob C \times ob C, V]$ that sends a family $F_{c,c'}$ of objects of $V$ to the family $\coprod_{c''} C(c,c'') \times F(c'',c')$.  That the diagram above is a split coequalizer then follows from general facts about algebras.

It is also a general fact (see e.g.~[Kelly, ch.~3](#Kelly)) that weighted (co)limits are continuous in their weight: that is,
$$ \{W \ast V, F\} \cong \{W, \{V-, F\}\}$$
and
$$ (W \ast V, G) \cong W \ast (V \ast G)$$
This implies, after some fiddling with the [[Yoneda lemma]], that $\{-,F\}$ takes the coequalizer above to the equalizer $(*)$, and similarly for $(**)$.


## Properties {#Properties}

### $Set$-enriched coends as ordinary colimits {#SetCoendsAsColimits}

Let the enriching category be $\mathcal{V} = $ [[Set]]. We describe a special way in this case to express ends/coends that give [[weighted limits]]/colimits in terms of ordinary (co)limits over categories of elements.

Consider

* $C$ a $Set$-enriched category/[[locally small category]] 
  [[tensoring|tensored]] over [[Set]]; 

* $D$ be a [[small category]];

* $F : D \to C$ a functor;

* $W : D^{op} \to Set$ another functor;

* $el W \to D^{op}$ the [[category of elements]] of $W$.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

We have a natural isomorphism in $C$

$$
  \int^{d \in D} W(d) \cdot F(d)
  \simeq
  \lim_{\to}(
    (el W)^{op} \to D \stackrel{F}{\to} C
  )
$$

between the coend as indicated and the [[colimit]] over the opposite of the 
category of elements of $W$.

=--

This is equation (3.34) in ([Kelly](#Kelly)) in view of (3.70).

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

If $W = D(-,e)$ is a [[representable functor]], then 

$$
  (el W)^{op} = D/e
$$

is the [[over category]] over the representing object $e$. This has a [[terminal object]], namely $(e \stackrel{Id}{\to} e$). Therefore

$$
  \lim_\to( D/e \to D \stackrel{F}{\to} C) \simeq F(e)
  \,.
$$

Since this is natural in $e$, the above proposition asserts a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  F(-) \simeq \int^{k \in D} D(k,-) \cdot F(k)
  \,.
$$

This statement is sometimes called the [[co-Yoneda lemma]].




=--


### Commutativity of ends and coends

Ordinary [[limit]]s commute with each other, if both limits exist separately. The analogous statement does hold for ends and coends. Since there it looks like the commutativity of two integrals, it is called the _Fubini theorem_ for ends (for instance [Kelly, p. 29](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10.pdf#page=29)).

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition
**(Fubini theorem for ends)**

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]]. Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be small 
$\mathcal{V}$-[[enriched categories]]. 

Let

$$
  T : (\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B})^{op} \otimes 
      (\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B})
      \to 
      \mathcal{V}
$$

be a $\mathcal{V}$-[[enriched functor]]. Then:

If for all object $B,B' \in \mathcal{B}$ the end $\int_{A \in \mathcal{A}} T(A,B,A,B')$ exists, then 

$$
  \int_{(A,B) \in \mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B}}
   T(A,B,A,B)
  \simeq
  \int_{A \in \mathcal{A}}
  \int_{B \in \mathcal{B}}
  T(A,B,A,B)
$$

if either side exists. In particular, since $\mathcal{A} \otimes \mathcal{B} \simeq \mathcal{B} \otimes \mathcal{A}$ this implies that

$$
  \int_{B \in \mathcal{B}}
  \int_{A \in \mathcal{A}}
  T(A,B,A,B)
  \simeq
  \int_{A \in \mathcal{A}}
  \int_{B \in \mathcal{B}}
  T(A,B,A,B)
$$

if either side exists.

## Examples

### Enriched functor categories 

For $C$ and $D$ both $V$-[[enriched category|enriched categories]], the $V$-[[enriched functor category]] $[C,D]$ is the $V$-[[enriched category]] whose

* objects are $V$-[[enriched functors]] $F : C \to D$;

* [[hom-objects]] in $V$ are given by the end-formula $[C,D](F,G) := \int_{c \in C} D(F(c), G(c))$.

For $V = Set$ this reproduces of course the ordinary [[functor category]].


### Kan extension

If the $V$-[[enriched category]] $D$ is [[copower|tensor]]ed over $V$, then the (left) [[Kan extension]] of a [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ along a functor $p : C \to B$ is given by the coend

$$
  Lan F : b \mapsto  \int_{c \in C} hom(p(c),b) \cdot F(c)
  \,.
$$

See [[Kan extension]] for more details.


### Geometric realization

A special case of the example of Kan extension is that of [[geometric realization]]. 

Very generally, geometric realization is the left Kan extension of a functor $F : C \to D$ along the [[Yoneda embedding]] $Y : C \to [C^{op},V]$.

The "geometric realization" of an object $X \in [C,V]$ with respect to $F$ is then the coend 

$$
  |X| := \int^{c \in C} F(c) \cdot hom(Y(c),X)
  \simeq \int^{c \in C} F(c) \cdot X(c)
  \,,
$$

where the last step on the right uses the [[Yoneda lemma]].

More specifically, traditionally this is thought of as applying to the case where $C = \Delta$ is the [[simplex category]] and where $F : \Delta \to Top$ regards the abstract $n$-[[simplex]] as the standard simplex as a [[topological space]].
