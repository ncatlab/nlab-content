A [[topological space]] $X$ satisfies the __$T_D$ separation axiom__ if, given any [[element]] $a$ of $X$, the [[singleton subset]] $\{a\}$ is an [[open subspace]] in the [[induced topology]] on its own [[closed subspace|closure]].  In other words, for every point $a$, there is a [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $a$ such that the [[intersection]] of $U$ and $Cl\{a\}$ is $\{a\}$.
