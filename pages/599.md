## Research Areas

My DPhil Thesis (submitted 1961) under Michael Barratt was on the algebraic topology of function spaces, more specifically to make some progress in computing the homotopy type oh the function space $X^Y$ by induction on the Postnikov system of $X$. In the following, numbers in round  brackets  refer to my publication list, with many downloadable as pdfs. 

* General Topology 

My first two papers were on the exponential law for topological spaces, and led to the notion of [[convenient category of topological spaces]].  

* Algebraic Topology 

* Group Theory 

* Seifert van Kampen Theorems 

This has been a major area of work, starting with the theorem for the fundamental groupoid on a _set_ of base points, instead of just the fundamental group, (8). This use of groupoids was publicised in a book published  in 1968 as "Elements of Modern Topology" and now in its third revised edition, published in 2006,  as [Topology and Groupoids](http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/topgpds.html). 

The writing of this book led to the notion that all of 1-dimensional homotopy theory was better expressed in terms of groupoids rather than groups, and hence to the question of whether groupoids can be useful, or not, in higher dimensional homotopy theory.  A clue was that whereas group objects internal to groups were just abelian groups, this was not so for group objects internal to groupoids, or the equivalent groupoid objects internal to groups. So there was a possibility of realising the dreams of the algebraic topologists of the early 20th century of finding higher dimensional versions of the fundamental group, since it was recognised that the nonabelian nature of the fundamental group was of importance in problems of geometry and analysis. 

Part of this was founded on the idea that the proof of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for the fundamental group(oid) seemed to generalise to higher dimensions, if one had a homotopical double groupoid gadget which allowed multiple compositions and also for the notion of _commutative cube_, such that any compositions of commutative cubes was commutative. 

This programme was realised in dimension 2 in the paper with Philip Higgins, (25), based on crucial work with Chris Spencer, (20,21), and in all dimensions, again with Higgins,  in (32,33). 

This work gives an exposition of basic algebraic topology without using singular homology or simplicial approximation, 

1.  the Brouwer Degree Theorem  (the $n$-sphere $S^n$ is
$(n-1)$-connected and the homotopy classes of maps of $S^n$ to
itself are classified by an integer called the _degree_ of the
map);

1. the Relative Hurewicz Theorem, which  is seen here as describing the
morphism $ \pi_n(X,A,x) \to \pi_n(X \cup CA,CA,x) \to^\cong
\pi_n(X \cup CA,x) $ when $(X,A)$  is $(n-1)$-connected,  and so this formulation does
not require the usual involvement of  homology groups;

1.  Whitehead's theorem (1949) that $\pi _2(X \cup \{e^2_{\lambda}
\},X,x)$ is a free crossed $\pi_1(X,x)$-module;

1.  a generalisation of that theorem to describe the crossed module
$ \pi_2(X \cup_f CA,X,x)\to \pi_1(X,x) $ as induced by the morphism
 $f_*  \colon  \pi_1(A,a) \to \pi_1(X,x)$ from the identity crossed module $\pi_1(A,a) \to  \pi_1(A,a)$; and

1.  a coproduct description  of the crossed module $ \pi_2(K \cup
 L,M,x) \to \pi_1(M,x) $ when $M= K \cap L$ is connected and $(K,M),
 (L,M)$ are 1-connected and cofibred.
