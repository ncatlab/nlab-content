## Idea

The [[complex geometry]]-analog of the [[de Rham theorem]] is the _Dolbeault theorem_:

for $X$ a [[complex manifold]] then ints [[Dolbeault cohomology]] in bi-degree $(p,q)$ is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] in degree $q$ of the [[abelian sheaf]] $\Omega^p \coloneqq \Omega^{p,0}$ of [[holomorphic p-forms]]

$$
  H^{p,q}(X)\simeq H^q(X,\Omega^p)
  \,.
$$
