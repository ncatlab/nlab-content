A continuous map is a morphism in the category of [[topological spaces]] and in some similar contexts like [[locales]] and convergence spaces. 

A function $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is a __continuous map__ if for every open subset $U\subset Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Continuous maps of topological spaces preserve connectedness and send compact subsets to compact subsets. However it is not necessary that the inverse of a compact set is compact; the continuous maps such that the preimage of any compact set is compact are called __proper maps__. 
A continuous map of topological spaces which is invertible as a function of sets, is a __homeomorphism__ if the inverse function is a continuous map as well. A continuous map is __open__ (resp. __closed__) if it sends open (resp. closed) subsets to open (closed) subsets. Every continuous map from a compact to Hausdorff space is both closed and proper. 

A function $f$ between [[convergence spaces]] is __continuous__ if for any filter $F$ such that $F \to x$, it follows that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the filterbase $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$.
