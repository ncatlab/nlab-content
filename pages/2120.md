A continuous map is a morphism in the category of [[topological spaces]] and in some similar contexts like [[locales]] and [[convergence spaces]]. 

A [[function]] $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is a __continuous map__ if for every open subset $U\subset Y$, the [[preimage]] $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Continuous maps of topological spaces preserve [[connected space|connectedness]] and send [[compact space|compact]] subsets to compact subsets. However it is not necessary that the preimage of a compact set be compact; the continuous maps such that the preimage of any compact set is compact are called __[[proper map]]s__. 
A continuous map of topological spaces which is invertible as a function of sets, is a __[[homeomorphism]]__ if the [[inverse function]] is a continuous map as well. A continuous map is __[[open map|open]]__ (resp. __closed__) if it sends open (resp. closed) subsets to open (closed) subsets. Every continuous map from a compact space to a [[Hausdorff space]] is both closed and proper. 

A function $f$ between [[convergence spaces]] is __continuous__ if for any filter $F$ such that $F \to x$, it follows that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the filterbase $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$.

A __continuous map__ between [[locales]] is simply a [[frame]] homomorphism in the opposite direction.
