## Definition

For $A : \Delta \to C$ a [[cosimplicial object]] in a [[category]] $C$ which is [[powering|powered]] over [[simplicial sets]] and for

$$
  \Delta : [n] \mapsto \Delta[n]
$$

the canonical cosimplicial simplicial set of [[simplices]], the **totalization** of $A$ is the [[end]]

$$
  \int_{[k]\in \Delta}
  (A_k)^{\Delta[k]}
  \,\,\,
  \in 
  C
  \,.
$$

This is dual to [[geometric realization]]. 

## Related concepts

Formally the dual to totalization is [[geometric realization]]: where totalization is the [[end]] over a [[power]]ing with $\Delta$, realization is the [[coend]] over the [[tensoring]].

But various other operations carry names similar to "totalization". For instance a [[total chain complex]] is related under [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[bisimplicial set]] -- see [[Eilenberg-Zilber theorem]]. As discussed at _[[bisimplicial set]]_, this is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the operation that is often called $Tot$ and called the _total simplicial set_ of a bisimplicial set.

To a cosimplicial chain complex we can assign a double complex by taking the alternating sum of the coface maps. Then the totalization of this cosimplicial object and the totalization of the double complex as defined in homological algebra coincide. Moreover, the associated [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence]] and [[spectral sequence of a double complex]] coincide.
