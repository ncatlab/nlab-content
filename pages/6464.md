## Definition

For $A : \Delta \to C$ a [[cosimplicial object]] in a [[category]] $C$ which is [[powering|powered]] over [[simplicial sets]] and for

$$
  \Delta : [n] \mapsto \Delta[n]
$$

the canonical cosimplicial simplicial set of [[simplices]], the **totalization** of $A$ is the [[end]]

$$
  \int_{[k]\in \Delta}
  (A_k)^{\Delta[k]}
  \,\,\,
  \in 
  C
  \,.
$$

This is dual to [[geometric realization]]. 

## Related concepts

Formally the dual to totalization is [[geometric realization]]: where totalization is the [[end]] over a [[power]]ing with $\Delta$, realization is the [[coend]] over the [[tensoring]].

But various other operations carry names similar to "totalization". For instance a [[total chain complex]] is related under [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[bisimplicial set]] -- see [[Eilenberg-Zilber theorem]]. As discussed at _[[bisimplicial set]]_, this is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the operation that is often called $Tot$ and called the _total simplicial set_ of a bisimplicial set.
