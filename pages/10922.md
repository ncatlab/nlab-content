Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. An
algebra of continuous trace over $X$ 
is a $C^*$-algebra $A$ with dual space $\hat{A} = X$, such
that Fell’s condition holds: for each $x_0\in X$, there is $a\in A$ such that $x(a)$ is a rank-one projection for each $x$ in a neighbourhood of $x_0$. This holds if and only if the set of all $a\in A$ for which the map $\pi\mapsto 
tr (\pi(a)\pi(a)^*)$ is finite and continuous on $\hat{A}$ is dense in $A$. A Fell algebra is a $C^*$-algebra $A$
which satisfies Fell’s condition but $X$ is not necessarily Hausdorff. 

A continuous trace $C^*$-algebra is, to some extent, an operator algebraic counterpart to the theory of [[Azumaya algebra]]s. [[Dixmier-Douady class]] has been designed originally to give invariant of such operator algebras.
