
A [[function]] $f$ on the [[complex plane|complex line]] $\mathbb{C}$ is _holomorphic_ if it is complex-[[differentiable function|differentiable]]. It is a famous theorem (due to Cauchy and Goursat) that all holomorphic functions are in fact [[smooth function|smooth]].

Similarly for functions on $\mathbb{C}^n$ or any [[complex manifold]].

Compare [[analytic function]].
