## Idea

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] of even [[dimension]] and with [[spin structure]], write $\mathcal{S}(X)$ for the [[spin bundle]] and 

$$
  \mathcal{S}(X) \simeq \mathcal{S}^+(X) \oplus \mathcal{S}^-(X)
$$

for its decomposition into [[chiral spinor]] bundles. For $(X,g)$ the [[Riemannian manifold]] structure and $\nabla$ the corresponding [[Levi-Civita connection|Levi-Civita]] [[spin connection]] consider the map

$$
  c \circ \nabla 
  \;\colon\;
  \Gamma(\mathcal{S}^+(X))
  \to 
  \Gamma(\mathcal{S}^-(X))
$$

given by composing the action of the [[covariant derivative]] on [[sections]] with the [[symbol map]]. This is an [[elliptic operator]]. The [[index of an elliptic operator|index]] of this operator is called the **$\hat A$-[[genus]]**.
