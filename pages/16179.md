## Idea

The _fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry_ is the [[theorem]] which states that on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-[[Riemannian manifold]] there is a unique metric-compatible [[affine connection]] with vanishing [[torsion]] -- the _[[Levi-Civita connection]]_.

In terms of [[integrability of G-structures]] this says that the [[torsion of a G-structure|torsion]] of an [[orthogonal structure]] vanishes, see at _[integrability of G-structures -- Examples -- Orthogonal structure](integrability+of+G-structures#ExamplesOrthogonalStructure)_.
