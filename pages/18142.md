## Idea

The _Jordan curve theorem_ is a basic fact in [[topology]]. It stands out as having a statement that intuitively seems completely obvious, but which turns out to require a non-trivial [[formal proof]].

The theorem states that every [[continuous function|continuous]] [[loop]] (where a loop is a closed [[curve]]) in the [[Euclidean plane]] which does not intersect itself divides the plane into two disjoint [[regions]], the inside contained in the curve, and the outside.
