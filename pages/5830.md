## Idea

_Homotopy type theory_ is [[intensional type theory|intensional]] ([[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf]]-)[[dependent type theory]]  equipped with the [[univalence axiom]]. 

Its [[semantics]] interprets [[types]] not as [[sets]] but as [[homotopy types]]/[[∞-groupoids]].
Where [[extensional type theory]] is the [[internal language]] of [[locally cartesian closed categories]], [[intensional type theory]] with the [[identity types]] that it provides behaves and supplemented by univalence behaves like the [[internal language of an (∞,1)-topos]]. 

Some details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a [[foundation]] for [[mathematics]] that is natively about [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]].

## Machine implementation

An important aspect of HoTT is the fact that [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] has a computational implementation in proof assistants like [[Coq]] and [[Agda]].

This forms the basis of  the _Univalent Foundations_ program ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky)), which uses Coq to generate and verify proofs with [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] content.

See the [code page](http://homotopytypetheory.org/coq/) at the [HoTT site](#HoTTSite) for more.

### Dictionary to homotopy theory
 {#DictionaryToCoq}

The following list displays some keywords defined in the [[Coq]]-implementation of homotopy type theory together with their meaning in the [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]] that they describe.

> Under construction. Needs to be scrutinized. Meanwhile, handle with care.

Let $C$ be a given ambient [[(∞,1)-category]] which 

* has [[(∞,1)-pullback]]s and [[(∞,1)-pushout]]s, 

  * hence has a [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]];

* is [[cartesian closed (∞,1)-category|cartesian closed]].

Possibly an [[(∞,1)-topos]].
 
Then

    Type

denotes $Core(C)$, the [[core]] of $C$, hence the maximal [[∞-groupoid]] inside $C$. Or more precisely, a [[(sub)object classifier in an (infinity,1)-topos|object classifier]].

    X : Type

denotes an [[object]] in the $(\infty,1)$-category $C$; equivalently an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $X : * \to C$.

    unit : Type

is the [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]].

For $X, Y \in C$ two objects

    X -> Y : Type

denotes the [[internal hom]] $[X,Y] \in C$ (a formal proof of that is [here](https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/HoTT/blob/master/Coq/Limits/AdjunctionProdHom.v)).

    P (x : X) : Type

denotes a [[bundle]] $P \to X$ in $C$, called a _$X$-[[dependent type]]_. In a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of $C$ by a [[category of fibrant objects]] it denotes a [[fibration]] $P \to X$.

    P : X -> Type

denotes the corresponding classifying map, via something like the [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]].

The total space object $P$ of this bundle (the _[[dependent sum]]_ of the bundle) is the type equivalently coded as

    { x : X  & P x} : Type

or

    total (fun (x : X) => P x) : Type.

It should also equivalently be called

    exists x : X, P x

(see [[existential quantifier]]) but in the current [[Coq]] implementation that keyword is reserved for [[(-1)-truncated]] $P_x$ ([[proposition]]s).

The code

    forall x : X, P x

for the [[universal quantifier]], denotes the object of [[homotopy]] [[section]]s of this bundle (the _[[dependent product]]_ of the bundle, see the section _[relation to spaces of sections](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+product#RelationToSpacesOfSections)_ there).

    f : forall x : X, P x

denotes therefore a particular [[section]] of this bundle

$$
  \array{
     && P
     \\  
     & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow& \downarrow
     \\ 
     X &= & X
  }
  \,.
$$

    a ~~> b

or

    Id (a b : X) : Type

for $a,b$ of type $X$ denotes the [[path space object]] from $a$ to $b$ in $X$, hence the [[homotopy pullback]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    a \times_X b &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{a}}
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{b}{\to}&  X
  }
  \,.
$$


More generally, we can define arbitrary pullbacks. If `f : A -> C` and `g : B -> C`, the [[homotopy pullback]] of `f` and `g` is defined by

    {a : A & {b : B & f a ~~> g b}}

together with the obvious projections to `A` and `B` and the homotopy between the composites.
(a proof can be found [here](https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/HoTT/blob/master/Coq/Limits/Pullbacks.v))

Using [[higher inductive types]], we can also define [[homotopy pushouts]]. if `g : C -> A` and `f : C -> B`, the [[homotopy pushout]] of `f` and `g` is defined by

    Inductive hopushout :=
      | inl : A -> hopushout
      | inr : B -> hopushout
      | glue : forall x : C, inl (g x) ~~> inr (f x).

together with the map `inl`, `inr` and the homotopy `glue`.
(see [here](https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/HoTT/blob/master/Coq/Limits/Pushout.v) for the proof)

### Models

The first [[model]] for [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] on [[groupoid]]s (instead of [[sets]] = [[0-groupoids]]) was

* [[Martin Hofmann]], [[Thomas Streicher]]  _The groupoid interpretation of type theory_. in Sambin, Giovanni (ed.) et al., _Twenty-five years of constructive type theory_ . Proceedings of a congress, Venice, Italy, October 19—21, 1995. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Oxf. Logic Guides. 36, 83-111 (1998).  ([ps](http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/venedig.ps.gz))

The fact that every [[simplicial model category]] in which the cofibrations are [[monomorphisms]] provides a sound [[model]] for [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] is discussed in 

* [[Steve Awodey]], [[Michael Warren]], _Homotopy theoretic models of identity type_,  Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society vol 146, no. 1 (2009) ([arXiv:0709.0248](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0248))

and with more details in 

* [[Michael Warren]], _Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory_, PhD thesis (2008) ([pdf](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/students/warren.pdf))

* [[Richard Garner]],  [[Benno van den Berg]], _Topological and simplicial models of identity types_. , ACM Transactions on Computational Logic ([pdf](http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~berg/papers/main.pdf))

What is not yet shown is that these models also validate the [[univalence axiom]]. This is currently only known to be the case for the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]], hence for the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]] of [[discrete ∞-groupoids]].
