## Idea

_Homotopy type theory_ refers broadly to the interpretation of [[intensional type theory|intensional]] ([[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf]]-)[[dependent type theory]] in [[homotopy theory]].  It is characterized by the viewpoint that [[identity types]] represent [[path spaces]], and are thereby used to define various concepts in homotopy theory.

In the [[categorical semantics|categorical]] [[semantics]] of homotopy type theory, [[types]] are interpreted not as [[set]]-like [[objects]], but as [[homotopy type]]- or [[∞-groupoid]]-like objects.  Thus, whereas [[extensional type theory]] can serve as the [[internal language]] of [[1-categories]] (such as [[pretoposes]], [[locally cartesian closed categories]], or [[elementary toposes]]), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of [[(∞,1)-category]].  (At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using [[model categories]] and related structures such as [[weak factorization systems]]).

In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures.  Notable among these are:

* Voevodsky's [[univalence axiom]], which represents [[object classifiers]] in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.

* Strong [[function extensionality]], which is a consequence of univalence.

* [[higher inductive type|Higher inductive types]], which among other things enable the construction of finite [[(∞,1)-colimits]], [[cell complexes]], [[n-truncated|truncations]], [[localizations]], and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the [[small object argument]].

With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the [[internal language of an (∞,1)-topos]], and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. 

Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a [[foundation]] for [[mathematics]] that is natively about [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]] --- in other words, a foundation in which *homotopy types*, rather than sets, are basic objects.

## Properties

### Models

It is well known that [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[dependent type theory]] is essentially the [[internal logic]] of [[locally cartesian closed categories]]. The step from extensional to [[intensional type theory]] and the [[identity types]] that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theors have models in certain [[(∞,1)-categories]]. The conjecture is ([Joyal, 2011](#Joyal)) that intensional dependent type theory with the [[univalence axiom]], hence homotopy type theory, is the internal language of [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]].

## Machine implementation

An important aspect of HoTT is the fact that [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] has a computational implementation in proof assistants like [[Coq]] and [[Agda]].

This forms the basis of  the _Univalent Foundations_ program ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky)), which uses Coq to generate and verify proofs with [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] content.

See the [code page](http://homotopytypetheory.org/coq/) at the [HoTT site](#HoTTSite) for more.

## Dictionary HoTT-Coq / $(\infty,1)$-Category theory
 {#DictionaryToCoq}

The following list displays some keywords defined in the [[Coq]]-implementation of homotopy type theory together with their meaning in the [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]] that they describe.

Let $C$ be a given ambient [[(∞,1)-category]] which

* is [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category|locally cartesian closed]];


* in addition has [[(∞,1)-colimits]]. 

For instance $C$ could be an [[(∞,1)-topos]] (in which case the homotopy type theory would be the [[internal language of an (∞,1)-topos]]).
 
While Coq-HoTT is supposed to be the internal language for such $C$, the _strict [[models]]_ for it are actually [[homotopical category|homotopical]] [[1-categories]] equipped with extra structure that make them serve as [[presentable (infinity,1)-categories|presentations]] for $C$. These strict models take place in [[categories of fibrant objects]].

We then have the following dictionary.

The [[type]] [[Type]] of types

    Type

denotes an [[object classifier]] in $C$ for a certain size of [[universe]]. The [[Coq]] system automatically performs [[universe enlargement]] as necessary.

A [[term]] of [[type]] Type

    X : Type

denotes an [[object]] in the $(\infty,1)$-category $C$; equivalently an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $X : * \to C$.

The [[unit type]]

    unit : Type

is the [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]].

For $X, Y \in C$ two objects, the [[function type]]

    X -> Y : Type

denotes the [[internal hom]] $[X,Y] \in C$ (a formal proof of that fact is [here](https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/HoTT/blob/master/Coq/Limits/AdjunctionProdHom.v)).

A [[dependent type]]

    P (x : X) : Type

denotes a [[bundle]] $P \to X$ in $C$, called. In a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of $C$ by a [[category of fibrant objects]] it denotes a [[fibration]] $P \to X$.

    P : X -> Type

denotes the corresponding classifying map, via an internal [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]].

The total space object $P$ of this bundle -- the _[[dependent sum type]]_ -- is the type equivalently coded as

    { x : X  & P x} : Type

or

    total (fun (x : X) => P x) : Type.

It should also equivalently be called

    exists x : X, P x

(see [[existential quantifier]]) but in the current [[Coq]] implementation that keyword is reserved for [[(-1)-truncated]] $P_x$ ([[proposition]]s).

The code

    forall x : X, P x

for the [[universal quantifier]], denotes the object of [[homotopy]] [[section]]s of this bundle (the _[[dependent product]]_ of the bundle, see the section _[relation to spaces of sections](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+product#RelationToSpacesOfSections)_ there).

    f : forall x : X, P x

denotes therefore a particular [[section]] of this bundle

$$
  \array{
     && P
     \\  
     & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow& \downarrow
     \\ 
     X &= & X
  }
  \,.
$$

The [[identity type]]

    paths X : X -> X -> Type

or

    Id (x y : X) : Type

corresponds in a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of $C$ by a [[category of fibrant objects]] to the [[path space object]] $X^I$. The fact that there is a [[weak equivalence]] $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X^I$ given by the inclusion of [[identity]] [[morphisms]] is reflected in the [[inductive type]]-definition of <code>paths</code>, which says that any proposition about terms in the path type is already fixed by its value on all identity paths.

Then for <code>x y : X</code> two [[terms]], the type (also called the [[identity type]]) denoted

    paths X x y : Type

or

    x ~~> y : Type

or
  
    x == y : Type

denotes the [[homotopy pullback]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    x \times_X y &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{y}{\to}&  X
  }
$$

which in a presentation by a [[category of fibrant objects]] is given (see [[factorization lemma]]) by the ordinary pullback

$$
  \array{
    P_{x,y} X &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
    \\
    \downarrow && X^{\Delta[1]} &\to& X
    \\  
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{y}{\to}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

Beware that the [[identity type|path induction rule]] applies to <code>paths X</code> not to <code>paths X x y</code>. Where for the former a proposition is fixed by what it does on identity paths, for the latter this is not the case anymore.

More generally, we can define arbitrary pullbacks. If `f : A -> C` and `g : B -> C`, the [[homotopy pullback]] of `f` and `g` is defined by

    {a : A & {b : B & f a ~~> g b}}

together with the obvious projections to `A` and `B` and the homotopy between the composites.
(a proof can be found [here](https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/HoTT/blob/master/Coq/Limits/Pullbacks.v))

Using [[higher inductive types]], we can also define [[homotopy pushouts]]. if `g : C -> A` and `f : C -> B`, the [[homotopy pushout]] of `f` and `g` is defined by

    Inductive hopushout :=
      | inl : A -> hopushout
      | inr : B -> hopushout
      | glue : forall x : C, inl (g x) ~~> inr (f x).

together with the map `inl`, `inr` and the homotopy `glue`.
(see [here](https://github.com/guillaumebrunerie/HoTT/blob/master/Coq/Limits/Pushout.v) for the proof)

### Models

The first [[model]] for [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] on [[groupoid]]s (instead of [[sets]] = [[0-groupoids]]) was

* [[Martin Hofmann]], [[Thomas Streicher]]  _The groupoid interpretation of type theory_. in Sambin, Giovanni (ed.) et al., _Twenty-five years of constructive type theory_ . Proceedings of a congress, Venice, Italy, October 19—21, 1995. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Oxf. Logic Guides. 36, 83-111 (1998).  ([ps](http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/venedig.ps.gz))

The fact that every [[simplicial model category]] in which the cofibrations are [[monomorphisms]] provides a sound [[model]] for [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] is discussed in

* [[Richard Garner]],  [[Benno van den Berg]], _Topological and simplicial models of identity types_. , ACM Transactions on Computational Logic ([pdf](http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~berg/papers/main.pdf))

What is not yet shown is that these models also validate the [[univalence axiom]]. This is currently only known to be the case for the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]], hence for the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]] of [[discrete ∞-groupoids]].

is explicitly stated the conjecture that the models of HoTT are [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]].
