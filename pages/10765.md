## Definition

For $p$ a [[prime number]], a [[group]] is _$p$-primary_ if each of its elements $g$ has [[order of a group|order]] a power $p^{n(g)}$ of the given prime.

(Also called _primary group_ a _$p$-group_, but NO relation to _[[n-group]]_.)

## Properties

### Relation to finite abelian group

Every [[finite abelian group]] is a [[direct sum]] of its $p$-primary subgroups. 

### Nilpotency

###### Proposition 
Every [[finite set|finite]] $p$-primary group $G$ has a nontrivial [[center of a group|center]] $Z(G)$. 
=-- 

For a proof, see [[class equation]]. 

Since the center $Z(G)$ is a [[normal subgroup]] of $G$, we may define by induction (with the help of this proposition [here](/nlab/show/normal+subgroup#inverse)) a series of inclusions of normal subgroups $Z^k(G) \subseteq G$ where $Z^0(G)$ is the trivial subgroup and $Z^k(G)$ is the inverse image of the center $Z(G/Z^{k-1}(G))$ along the canonical homomorphism $G \to G/Z^{k-1}(G)$. The resulting series 

$$Z^0(G) \subseteq \ldots \subseteq Z^{k-1}(G) \subseteq Z^k(G) \subseteq \ldots$$ 

is called the *upper central series* of $G$, and Proposition \ref{center} shows that in the case of a finite $p$-group, this series consists of strict inclusions that eventually terminate in the full subgroup $G$. A group with that property is a [[nilpotent group]]. In particular it is a [[solvable group]].
