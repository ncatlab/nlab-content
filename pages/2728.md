The super $q$-Schur algebra $S_{m|n}^d$ is the analogue over the [[Lie superalgebra]] $\mathfrak{sl}(m|n)$ of the usual [[Schur algebra|q-Schur algebra]].  That is, if we let $V$ denote the deformation of the defining representation of $mathfrak{sl}(m|n)$, then 
$$S_{m|n}^d=End_{U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(m|n))}(V^{\otimes d}).$$

When $q$ is generic, this is a quotient of the Hecke algebra by the ideal generated by all representations whose corresponding representations are not hooks.

In fact, when $m=n=1$ the weight spaces of $V^{\otimes d}$ are irreducible representations, with arm length of the hook  corresponding to weight.

[[Ben Webster]]: Does $S_{m|n}^d$ inherit a basis from the Hecke algebra in the usual way?  It certainly seems that the representation $V^{\otimes d}$ has a basis on which positive integral combination of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors act with positive integral coefficients.

Also, does this picture have a categorification?  One natural candidate to use in the $m=n=1$ case is the [categorifications of the cell modules](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0702.5811) due to Stroppel and Mazorchuk.  Also possibly of interest is their [categorification of Wedderburn basis](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0708.3949) of $S_n$
