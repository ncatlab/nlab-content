## Idea

A _T-fold_ is a [[space]] that locally looks like a [[Riemannian manifold]] but is glued together from these not just by [[diffeomorphism]]s but also by [[T-duality]] transformations.

The idea is that A T-fold is a [[target space]] for a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] that is only locally a [[Riemannian manifold]] but globally a more general kind of [[geometry]]. In the literature sometimes the term _non-geometric backgrounds_ is used for such "generalized geometric" backgrounds.
