## Idea

A _T-fold_ ([Hull 04](#Hull04)) is supposed to be a kind of [[space]] that locally looks like a [[Riemannian manifold]] equipped with a [[B-field]], but which is glued together from these not just by [[diffeomorphisms]] (as a [[smooth manifold]] is) but also by [[T-duality]] transformations along some [[torus]] [[fibers]].

The idea is that a T-fold is a [[target space]] for a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] that is only locally a [[Riemannian manifold]] but globally a more general kind of [[geometry]]. In the literature sometimes the term _[[non-geometric backgrounds]]_ is used for such "generalized geometric" backgrounds.

It is expected that T-folds should have a description in terms of spaces that locally are [[fiber products]] of one [[torus]] [[fiber bundle]] with its T-dual. (One proposed formalization is that these are the total spaces of [[principal 2-bundles]] for the [[T-duality 2-group]]). 

One may then consider [[local field theory]] on these double torus fibrations, and this is, or is closely related to, what is called _[[double field theory]]_ ([Hull 06](#Hull06)).

A mathematical formlization of the idea of T-folds, in terms of [[principal 2-bundles]] for the [[T-duality 2-group]] (hence in [[higher differential geometry]]) is developed in [Nikolaus-Waldorf 18](#NikolausWaldorf18).
