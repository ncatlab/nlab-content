## Idea

In the context of [[cobordism theory]], a [[generalized cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by a [[Thom spectrum]] is called a _cobordism cohomology theory_.

By default "cobordism cohomology" usually refers to what is represented by [[MO]]. 
The cohomology represented by [[MU]] is _[[complex cobordism cohomology]]_. Both are unified by [[MR-theory]].

See at those entries for more.
