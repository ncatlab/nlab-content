A plain _cogroup_ is 

* a [[group]] [[internalization|internal to]] $Set^{op}$, the [[opposite category]] of $Set$;

* the co-[[endomorphism monoid]] of a [[cocategory|cogroupoid]] with a single [[object]].

But the only [[group object]] in $Set^{op}$ is empty.  Don\'t we really want to work in [[pointed set]]s?  ---Toby

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: ah, that might be. Please save me here, I started wrting this when I realized it took me more thinking than I could afford, time-wise.  

_Toby_:  Perhaps the only relevant concept is [[cogroup object]].  In the examples of spheres and homotopy groups, what matters is that the spheres are cogroup objects in pointed spaces; that\'s the relevant category.  (And a good thing too, since the only cogroup object in $Top$ itself is empty again!)

#Examples#

The most familiar, though implicit, examples of co-groups are [[pointed object|pointed]] [[spheres]] that appear in the definition of [[homotopy group]]s.

For $X$ a [[topological space]], $S^n$ the [[pointed object|pointed]] $n$-sphere regarded as an object in...
