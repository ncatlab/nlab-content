## Idea

The **Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra** of a [[theory]] in [[propositional logic]] is an algebraic (and order-theoretic) structure built out of its [[formulas]] (modulo provable equivalence) and [[connectives]].  It thus carries an algebraic structure that corresponds to the logic in question and is generally the [[free]] such structure generated by the axioms of the theory.

## Examples

* The Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra of a theory in [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] propositional logic is a [[Heyting algebra]].

* The Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra of a theory in classical propositional logic is a [[Boolean algebra]].


## The Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra of a normal modal logic

Associated to any [[normal modal logic]], $\Lambda$ in $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$ (and more 
generally) is an algebra $\mathfrak{A}^\Lambda_\omega$,which is a [[algebraic models for modal logics|BAO]] of type $n$, 
i.e. $n$ (modal) operators, $m_i$.  This is called the **Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra** of $\Lambda$, and is a quotient of the [[term algebra]] of  $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$, i.e. of the free universal algebra of type $n$ formed by the $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$-formulae using the connectives $\vee$, $\wedge$, $\neg$, $\bot$, $\top$, and the $\Diamond_i$.  The Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra is formed from this free algebra by using the congruence $\simeq_\Lambda$, where 

$$\phi \simeq_\Lambda\psi  if and only if  {\vdash}_\Lambda \phi\leftrightarrow \psi.$$  
  
(Recall the usual rules of notation: $\phi \to \psi$ is $\neg\phi\vee\psi$; 
$\phi\leftrightarrow \psi$ is $(\phi\to \psi)\wedge (\psi\to\phi)$; and 
${\vdash}_\Lambda \phi $ means $\phi \in \Lambda$.)  
 
 
 The elements of $\mathfrak{A}^\Lambda_\omega$ are the equivalence 
classes:
  
$${\left\|\phi\right\|} = \{\psi \mid \vdash_\Lambda \phi\leftrightarrow \psi\},$$
 
with the operations 

*  ${\left\|\phi\right\|} + {\left\|\psi\right\|} = {\left\|\phi \vee \psi\right\|}$;

*  ${\left\|\phi\right\|} \cdot {\left\|\psi\right\|}= {\left\|\phi \wedge \psi\right\|}||||$;

*  $||\phi||^- = ||\neg\phi||$;
 
*  $0 =||\bot||$; 

*  $1 = ||\top||$;

and

*  $m_i||\phi|| = ||\Diamond_i\phi|| .$$
 
As we assumed that $\Lambda$ was normal, the normality schemata:

 $(K)$: $\Diamond(\psi \vee \chi)\to \diamond \psi\vee \diamond \chi$; 

 $(N)$, in the form, $\neg \Diamond_i(\bot)$

and monotonicity :
 
if $\psi \to \chi \in \Lambda$ then $\Diamond_i \psi \to \Diamond_i \chi \in \Lambda$.

###### Lemma

$m_i$ is a normal operator.

###### Proof

We first note that $\vdash_\Lambda \Diamond(\psi\vee \phi) \leftrightarrow \Diamond_i \psi \vee \Diamond_i \phi$, then the result follows by simply writing down what is required and staring at it for a moment!

### Canonical models

The Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra for a modal logic, $\Lambda$,   gives rise a canonical Kripke model. This has the set of $\Lambda$-[[maximal consistent]] formulae as its set of states.
