A [[subset]] $A$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is **locally closed** if it is a [[closed subset]] of an [[open subspace]] of $X$. Equivalently, every point in $A$ has a neighborhood $U\subset X$ such that $A\cap U$ is closed in $U$. 

A locally closed subset for the [[Zariski topology]] on an [affine space](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/affine%20space#further_remarks_11) 
over an [[algebraically closed field]] is called an (embedded) _quasiaffine variety_, and a locally closed subset for the Zariski topology on a [[projective space]] over an algebraically closed field is called an (embedded) _quasiprojective variety_.
