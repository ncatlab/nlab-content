## Idea

A graded algebra is an associative algebra with a labelling on its elements by elements of some monoid or group, and such that the multiplication in the algebra is reflected in the multiplication in the labelling group. 

## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[group]].  (Often $G$ will be abelian, and, in fact, one usually takes by default $G = \mathbb{Z}$ the additive group of [[integer]]s, in which case the actual group being used is omitted from the terminology and notation.)

A **graded ring** is a [[ring]] $R$ equipped with a decomposition of the underlying [[abelian group]] as a [[direct sum]] $R = \oplus_{g \in G} R_g$ such that the product takes $R_{g} \times R_{g'} \to R_{g g'}$.

Analogously there is the notion of graded $k$-[[associative algebra]] over any commutative ring $k$.

Specifically for $k$ a [[field]] a **graded algebra** is a [[monoid]] internal to [[graded vector space]]s.

A [[differential graded algebra]] is a graded algebra $A$ equipped with a [[derivation]] $d : A\to A$ of degree +1 (or -1, dependig on conventions) and such that $d \circ d = 0$. This is the same as a [[monoid]] in the category of [[chain complex]]es.


## Properties

###### Proposition

For $R$ a commutative ring write $Spec R \in Ring^{op}$ for the corresponding object in the [[opposite category]]. Write $\mathbb{G}_m$ for the multiplicative group underlying the [[affine line]]. 

There is a [[natural isomorphism]] between

* $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on $R$;

* $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]]s on $Spec R$.

## Examples 


### Group ring

Let $G$ be any (discrete) group and $k[G]$, its [[group algebra]]. This has a direct sum decomposition as a $k$-module,

$$k[G] = \bigoplus_{g\in G}L_g$$

where each $L_g$ is a one dimensional free $k$-module, for which it is convenient, here, to give a basis $\{\ell_g\}$.  The graded algebra structure is obtained by extending the multiplication rule,

$$\ell_{g_1}\cdot \ell_{g_2} = \ell_{g_1g_2},$$

given on basis elements, by $k$-linearity.

### Lazard ring

The [[Lazard ring]], carrying the universal (1-dimensional, commutative) [[formal group law]] is naturally an $\mathbb{N}$-graded ring.
