## Idea

An $n$-connected space is a generalisation of the pattern:

*  [[space]],
*  [[inhabited space]],
*  [[path-connected space]],
*  [[simply connected space]],
*  etc.


## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is __$n$-connected__ or __$n$-simply connected__ if its [[homotopy groups]] are trivial up to degree $n$.

More explicitly, $X$ is __precisely $k$-connected__ if every [[continuous map]] to $X$ from the $k$-[[sphere]] extends to a continuous map to $X$ from the $k$-[[disk]].  Then $X$ is __$n$-(simply) connected__ if $X$ is precisely $k$-connected for $-1 \leq k \leq n$.


## Special cases

*  Any space is $(-2)$-simply connected.

*  A space is $(-1)$-simply connected precisely if it has an element; that is if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

*  A space is $0$-simply connected precisely if it is [[path-connected space|path-connected]].

*  A space is $1$-simply connected precisely if it is [[simply connected space|simply connected]].

*  A space is $\infty$-simply connected precisely if it is [[contractible space|weakly contractible]].


## Terminology

The traditional terminology is ‘$n$-connected’, but this violates the rule that ‘$1$-foo’ should mean the same as 'foo'.  This can be fixed by saying ‘$n$-simply connected’ instead, which also has the advantage of stressing that we are extending the change from connected to simply connected spaces.


## Properties

An $n$-connected topological space is precisely an [[n-connected object]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Gpd]], presented by the [[model category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]].


## Elementary point-set version

Consider this pattern:

*  [[space]],
*  [[inhabited space]],
*  [[connected space]],
*  [[unicoherent space]],
*  etc.

Let any [[topological space]] $X$ be __$(-2)$-unicoherent__, and let be __$n$-unicoherent__ (for $n \geq -1$) if $X$ is [[inhabited space|inhabited]] and, whenever $X$ is the [[union]] $A \cup B$ of two [[closed subspaces]] $A$ and $B$, if $A$ and $B$ are $(n-1)$-unicoherent in their own right, then their [[intersection]] $A \cap B$ is also $(n-1)$-unicoherent.  Finally, $X$ is __$\infty$-unicoherent__ if $X$ is $n$-unicoherent for any finite $n$.

The main clause of the definition is trivial for $n = -1$, so a $(-1)$-unicoherent space is precisely an inhabited space.  Then a $0$-unicoherent space is precisely a [[connected space]], and so on.

For [[locally path-connected spaces]] I believe that $n$-connectedness and $n$-unicoherence are equivalent, but I need to check.  (The term ‘$n$-unicoherent’ is new here, but ‘unicoherent’ is not.)
