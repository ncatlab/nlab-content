## Idea

Pointless topology is any formulation of [[topology]] not based on the notion of [[topological space]] as a [[set]] of [[points]] equipped with [[extra structure]].  Note that pointless topology *has* points, but they are not fundamental; and [[space]] may well have no points and yet be far from [[empty space|empty]].

In [[locale theory]], for example, one studies the set of [[open subspaces]] (with the extra structure of a [[frame]]) as the fundamental notion.  In [[formal topology]], one studies a set of *[[base for a topology|basic]]* open subspaces (with the extra structure of a [[posite]] with [[positivity predicate|positivity]]).  A locale is still a set with [[extra stuff]], but even this fails for formal topologies.

that develops, among other things, much of standard [[topology]] entirely with the notion of locale used in place of that of [[topological spaces]]. See _[[Stone Spaces]]_ for details.
