## Idea

The phenomenon or principle called _vector meson dominance_ (VMD) is a tight relation between [[quantum hadrodynamics]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]], where the electrically neutral [[light meson|light]] [[vector meson]] [[field (physics)|fields]] $V_\mu$ (the neutral [[rho-meson]] $\rho^0_\mu$, the [[omega-meson]] $\omega_\mu$ and the [[phi-meson]]) are seen to be on par with, or even identified with, the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[hadronic current]] $J^{hadr}$, at least to some approximation.

### Phenomenology
 {#Phenomenology}

In [[particle physics]] [[phenomenology]], _vector meson dominance_ is the observation that the [[interaction]] of [[hadrons]] with [[photons]] is dominated by [[interactions]] that procceed via excange of [[vector mesons]]. 

Specifically, the [[decay]] of [[electron]]/[[positron]]-[[pairs]] into [[hadrons]]  

$$
  e^+ + e^- \to H
$$

(reverse to the [[purely leptonic decay]] $H \to e^+ e^-$ of [[hadrons]]) is dominated by the [[light meson|light]] [[vector mesons]], in that the [[scattering cross section]] $\sigma(e^+ e^- \to H)$ is peaked at those [[energies]] corresponding to the [[rest masses]] of the vector mesons:

\begin{imagefromfile}
  "file_name": "VectorMesonDominanceInDileptonCrossSectionI.jpg",
  "width": 420,
  "caption": "[Piller-Weise 90, Fig. 1](#PillerWeise90)",
  "float": "right",
  "margin": {
    "top": 0,
    "right": 10,
    "bottom": 10,
    "left": 0,
    "unit": "px"
  } 
\end{imagefromfile}


The first graphics shows the measured cross section (in [[physical unit|units]] of that of the decay $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu_-$ of [[electron]] [[dileptons]] into [[muon]] [[dileptons]]): The [[light vector mesons]] [[rho-meson|ρ]]$^0$, [[omega-meson|ω]] and [[phi-meson|ϕ]] correspond to the the spikes below 1 [[GeV]], the further spikes correspond to [[heavy vector mesons]], with [[charmonium]] $J/\psi$ around 4 [[GeV]].

  "file_name": "VectorMesonDominanceInDileptonCrossSectionII.jpg",
  "width": 420,
  "caption": "[Piller-Weise 90, Fig. 2](#PillerWeise90)",  
  "float": "left",
  "margin": {
    "top": 0,
    "right": 10,
    "bottom": 10,
    "left": 0,
    "unit": "px"
  } 
\end{imagefromfile}


The second graphics shows the same data, now zoomed into the region of the [[light vector mesons]]. One sees clearly that in this region the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the [[scattering cross section]] is completely dominated first of all by the broad [[rho-meson|ρ]]$^0$ peak at a [[mass]] of $\sim 770$ [[MeV]] (see also [Murphy-Yount 71, Fig. 4](#MurphyYount71)), accompanied just by two sharp spikes, corresponding to the [[omega-meson|ω]] at $\sim 783$ [[MeV]] and the [[phi-meson|ϕ]] at $\sim 1020$ [[MeV]] (see also [Schildknecht 72, Table 1](#Schildknecht72)).



### Theory

In the [[effective field theory]] of [[quantum hadrodynamics]], _vector meson dominance_ refers to a proposal for how to formulate the [[theory (physics)|theory]] guided by the above [[phenomenology]]: 

Here the dominance is encoded by the _field-current identity_  ([Gell-Mann & Zachariasen 61](#GellMannZachariasen61), [Kroll, Lee & Zumino 76, (1.3)](#KrollLeeZumino76), [Sakurai 69, p. 54 onwards](#Sakurai69), review in [Piller-Weise 90, (4)](#PillerWeise90)):

$$
  J^{hadr}_\mu
  \;\sim\;
  V_\mu 
  \,,
$$ 

essentially identifying the electromagnetic [[hadron current]] with the joint neutral [[light meson|light]] [[vector meson]] [[field (physics)|field]].

This implies in particular that all [[coupling constants]] of [[interactions]] with an [[omega-meson]]/neutral [[rho-meson]] are proportional, by the same factor, to the corresponding electromagnetic coupling (reviewed in [Schildknecht 05, p. 3](#Schildknecht05)). 

In terms of a [[Lagrangian density]], this is encoded by meson/photon _mixed terms_ of the following form ([Kroll, Lee & Zumino 76, (2.7)](#KrollLeeZumino76),[Sakurai 69, p. 67](#Sakurai69)):

\[
  \label{VMD1Lagrangian}
  \mathbf{L}_{VMD1}
  \;\sim\;
  d V \wedge \star_4 d A
  \;+\;
  V \wedge \star_4 J^{hadr}
\]

obtained from the Lagrangian density $\mathbf{L}_{EM} \;\sim\; d A \wedge \star_{4} d A + A \wedge \star_4 J_{hadr}$ of [[Maxwell theory]] by exchanging a [[photon]] field variable $A$ with a [[vector meson]] [[field (physics)|field]] $V$ (reviewed in [OCPTW 95, p. 10](#OCPTW95), [Schildknecht 05, p. 4](#Schildknecht05)).

There is also an alternative, supposedly equivalent, Lagrangian formulation, less elegant but now in more widespread use. To distinguish the two one speaks of "VMD1" for the formulation (eq:VMD1Lagrangian) and of "VMD2" for the alternative formulation (reviewed in [OCPTW 95. (26)](#OCPTW95), [Schildknecht 05, (8)](#Schildknecht05)).


## Properties

### Derivation from holography

From [OCPTW 95](#OCPTW95):

> No direct translation between the [[standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] and [[vector meson dominance|VMD]] has yet been made.

\linebreak

From [Rho et al. 16](AdS-QCD#RhoEtAl16):

> One can make $[$[[chiral perturbation theory]]$]$ consistent with [[QCD]] by suitably matching the [[correlators]] of the [[effective field theory|effective theory]] to those of [[QCD]] at a [[scale]] near $\Lambda$. Clearly this procedure is not limited to only one set of [[vector mesons]]; in fact, one can readily generalize it to an infinite number of hidden [[gauge fields]] in an [[effective field theory|effective]] [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian]]. In so doing, it turns out that a fifth dimension is "deconstructed" in a (4+1)-dimensional (or 5D) [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] type form. We will see in Part III that such a structure arises, [[top-down model building|top-down]], in [[string theory]].

> $[...]$

> $[$this [[holographic QCD]]$]$ model comes out to describe — unexpectedly well — low-energy properties of both [[mesons]] and [[baryons]], in particular those properties reliably described in quenched [[lattice QCD]] simulations.

> $[...]$

> One of the most noticeable results of this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]] is the first derivation of vector dominance (VD) that holds both for [[mesons]] and for [[baryons]]. It has been
somewhat of an oddity and a puzzle that [[Jun John Sakurai|Sakurai's]] [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] — with the lowest [[vector mesons]] [[rho meson|ρ]] and [[omega meson|ω]] — which held very well for [[pion|pionic]] [[form factors]] at low momentum transfers famously failed for [[nucleon]] [[form factors]]. In this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]], the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] comes out automatically for both the [[pion]] and the [[nucleon]] provided that the infinite $[$[[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-]]$]$tower is included. While the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] for the [[pion]] with the infinite tower is not surprising given the successful Sakurai VD, that the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] holds also for the [[nucleons]] is highly nontrivial. $[...]$ It turns out to be a consequence of a [[AdS/QCD|holographic]] [[Cheshire cat principle|Cheshire Cat phenomenon]]
