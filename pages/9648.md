Given a partial differential equation containing a parametrized part called a potential and describing time evolution and having suitable notion of asymptotic solution at infinity, the operator may be suitable for describing 
a variant of the phenomenon of [[scattering]], hence one can establish the appropriate notions of scattering data and scattering potential. __Inverse problem of scattering__ is to determine the scattering potental from the knowledge of scattering data.

Classical inverse scattering method is to apply the methods of solving the invrese scattering problem to finding the exact solutions of nonlinear PDE-s.
Its analogue at (second) quantized level is the [[quantum inverse scattering method]].
