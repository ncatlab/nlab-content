## Idea

A mathematical object is an object studied by [[mathematics]].

## Formalist definition

From a [[formalist]] viewpoint, a __mathematical object__
is a [[term]] in whatever system of [[formal logic]]
we happen to be using at the moment.
We can also consider [[types]] as mathematical
objects by interpreting them as terms in some [[universe]].

## Platonic view

Of course, there is more to mathematical objects
than their syntactic aspect exhibited above in the formalist definition.

A good example is the notion of an [[(∞,1)-category]],
which exists at the Platonic level,
and whose “shadows” (using Plato's terminology)
in the world of rigorous mathematics
have been exhibited as various models of [[(∞,1)-categories]]:
[[relative categories]], [[quasicategories]], [[Segal categories]],
[[complete Segal spaces]], [[simplicial categories]], etc.

However, the concept of [[(∞,1)-categories]] per se
resists formalization in a satisfactory way.
[[Homotopy type theory]] may succeed one day on this path,
but so far no working definition has been exhibited yet.
