## Idea

A mathematical object is an object studied by [[mathematics]]. This notion gets involved as soon as one asks the question what mathematical objects consist of, or---more generally---what it does mean for such an object to "exist". A further question, depending on the answer to the first, is how we can know about mathematical objects.

## Formalist definition

From a [[formalist]] viewpoint, a __mathematical object__
is a [[term]] in whatever system of [[formal logic]]
we happen to be using at the moment.
We can also consider [[types]] as mathematical
objects by interpreting them as terms in some [[universe]].

## Platonic views

Using the Platonic viewpoint,
one can identify mathematical objects
that do not fit the formalist paradigm.

A good example is the notion of an [[(∞,1)-category]],
which exists at the Platonic level,
and whose “shadows” (using Plato's terminology)
in the world of rigorous mathematics
have been exhibited as various models of [[(∞,1)-categories]]:
[[relative categories]], [[quasicategories]], [[Segal categories]],
[[complete Segal spaces]], [[simplicial categories]], etc.

However, the concept of [[(∞,1)-categories]] per se
resists formalization in a satisfactory way.
[[Homotopy type theory]] may succeed one day on this path,
but so far no working definition has been exhibited yet.
