## Idea
 {#Idea}

In the context of _foundations of mathematics_ or _[[mathematical logic]]_ one studies formal systems -- [[theories]] -- that allow to formalize much if not all of [[mathematics]] (and hence, by extension, at least aspects of mathematical fields such as fundamental [[physics]]).

There are two different attitudes to what a desireable or interesting foundation should achieve:

1. In **Bolzano-Frege-Peano-Russell-style foundations** the emphasis is on seeing which formal systems, however covoluted they may be conceptually, allow to formalize and prove which [[theorems]]. 

   The archetypical such system is [[ZFC]] [[set theory]]. Other formal systems of interest here are [[elementary function arithmetic]] and [[second order arithmetic]], because they are [[proof theory|proof-theoretically]] weak, and still can derive "almost all of undegraduate mathematics" ([Friedman](#Friedman)).

1. In **practical foundations** (following a term introduced in ([Taylor](#Taylor))) the emphasis is on conceptually natural formalizations that _concentrate the essence of practice and in turn use the result to guide practice_ ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)).

   Formal systems of interest here are [[ETCS]] or flavors of [[type theory]], which allow natural expressions for central concepts in mathematics (notably via their [[categorical semantics]] and the conceptual strength of [[category theory]]).


## Category theory and foundations
{#categories}

There are two big questions about [[category theory]] and the logical foundations of mathematics:

 1. What foundations are adequate to formulate category theory?
 2. How can category theory provide a foundation for mathematics?

These questions also apply to [[higher category theory]], which also involves the relation between them. (2-categories as a foundation for categories, for example.)

For a philosophical treatment of category theoretic foundations see [[foundations and philosophy]]. 


### Mathematical foundations of category theory
{#MFCT}

The problem with mathematical foundations of category theory is that in category theory we frequently speak of [[large category|large categories]], which it is tricky to deal with rigorously in the usual sort of [[set theory|set theories]].

One common view seems to be to found category theory on a theory of sets and classes; see [the English Wikipedia\'s definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_%28mathematics%29#Definition), for example. But the standard reference, Saunders Mac Lane\'s _Categories for the Working Mathematician_, assumes the existence of a universe (an inaccessible cardinal) instead. Both of these approaches rely on a distinction between *small* and *large* categories. There is a category of all [[small category|small categories]], but this category is not itself small; there is no category of all categories.

Alexander Grothendieck used more (although [apparently](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.mathematics.categories/6847) he did not need to); he used what we now call [[Grothendieck universes]]s\. He assumed that every set is contained within a universe; that is, for every cardinal number $\kappa$, there is a cardinal inaccessible from $\kappa$. (This is still a rather moderate axiom, compared to some of the large-cardinal axioms studied by set theorists.) Now one has a relative notion of small and large; the category of all $U$-small categories (where $U$ is some universe) is $U$-large but must be $U'$-small for some other universe $U'$, and there exists a category (which is both $U$-large and $U'$-large) of all $U'$-small categories.

If one does not accept the [[axiom of choice]], then there are additional complications in general category theory. In particular, one must distinguish between a universal *property* (for example, having all [[product]]s) and having a universal *structure* realising that property (in the example, a functor taking each pair $(x,y)$ of objects to a specific product cone $x \leftarrow x \times y \rightarrow y$). This difficulty was overcome by Michael Makkai using [[anafunctor]]s, but these have not been widely adopted, even by constructivists.

For a summary of the mathematical foundations of category theory, see Mike Shulman, _Set theory for category theory_, [arXiv:0810.1279](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1279).


#### The concept of _identity_
{#Identity}

One way to think of category theory is as a framework in which the idea is formalized that every kind of [[equality]] is really secretly a choice of [[isomorphism]] or [[equivalence]]. In some sense the notion of identity is potentially [[evil]], in a technical sense.

[[Michael Makkai]] works on a language, [[FOLDS]] ('first-order logic with dependent sorts'), which is designed to make it impossible to formulate any [[evil]] statements.


### Categorial foundations of mathematics
{#CFM}

Bill Lawvere proposed to found mathematics on a first-order axiomatisation of [[Cat|the category of categories]]. This has not been very successful, 
but his other proposal, a first-order axiomatisation of [[Set|the category of sets]], works well. These and related approaches to foundations may be called _structural_ or _categorial_ (or _categorical_, which is more common but clashes with another sense of 'categorical' in logic).



Lawvere\'s system [[ETCS]] (for 'the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets') essentially states that the category of sets is a [[topos]] with certain properties, in particular a [[well-pointed topos]]. This can be stated in elementary (first-order) terms; indeed, Lawvere invented the now-default notion of *elementary* topos (in contrast to the original notion of [[Grothendieck topos]]) to do this.

It is also possible to found mathematics on the [[internal logic|internal language]] of a topos. In this case, the topos need *not* be well-pointed (and indeed, the condition that a topos be well-pointed cannot be stated in its own internal language; or if you prefer, *every* topos is well-pointed *internally*). This is equivalent to a certain formulation of [[type theory]], so it is (in a sense) nothing new, although it leads to new perspectives, as in the next paragraph.

Categories (not just toposes) can serve as models of [[type theory|type theories]], each type theory corresponding to a certain class of categories. Toposes correspond directly to a constructive but impredicative type theory; to make the theory predicative (in the constructivists\' sense) you generalise to a [[pretopos]] (maybe [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]]), to make the theory nonconstructive you specialise to a [[Boolean topos]], and so on. More specifically, every category\'s internal language is a type theory (with many odd constants), and every type theory (of appropriate form) defines a category (its free model); this is an [[adjunction]] between categories and type theories. Paul Taylor\'s book _[[Practical Foundations|Practical Foundations of Mathematics]]_ is essentially all about this subject, as is (at a more advanced level) most of the career of Michael Makkai.

Certain 'strong' axioms of [[set theory]] (those involving [[quantification]] over all sets) are difficult to state in category-theoretic (or type-theoretic) terms, but this can be overcome in a theory like ETCS; talk to Mike Shulman. (Ironically, this makes it harder to do foundations with categorial foundations!)

In contrast, many of the optional or controversial axioms of set theory (such as the [[axiom of choice]]) can be stated quite directly in ETCS. These can be examined quite well in a naïve set-theoretic language that never need be precise about whether one\'s foundations are traditional (membership-based), categorial, or whatever.

## Effect of foundations on concrete problems
{#Concrete}

It may seem on first sight that foundational questions in mathematics are remote from "real mathematics". This is not quite so. For a list of "real world" problems that do depend on foundations see
