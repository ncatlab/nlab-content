## Idea

_Poisson geometry_ is primarily the study of [[Poisson manifolds]] and the [[foliation]] by [[symplectic leaves]], but more generally it involves a host of induced and related structures that apear notably in the study of [[deformation quantization]] of Poisson manifolds, such as their [[Poisson Lie algebroids]], [[coisotropic submanifolds]], [[symplectic Lie groupoids]] etc.
