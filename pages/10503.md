## Idea

An __endofunction__ (or __self-mapping__ or other variation) is an [[endomorphism]] in [[the category of sets]], that is a [[function]] from a [[set]] $X$ to $X$ itself.  This is the typical meaning of the word 'function' in some contexts, such as high-school algebra (where $X$ is the set of [[real numbers]], although there we actually use [[partial functions]]) or when distinguishing from the [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] concepts of [[functional]] and [[operator]].
