A **code loop** a certain sort of [[Moufang loop]] constructed as a central extension of certain vector spaces over the [[finite field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$. In particular, such vector spaces are taken to be doubly even binary codes.

A general result about the existence of code loops is as follows.

**Theorem:** ([Griess](#Griess)) Every doubly even binary code has a unique extension by a code loop.

Code loops were originally defined independently by Robert Griess and Richard Parker. A modern description is in ([Hsu](#Hsu)).

Parker's code loop was used by [[John Conway]] to construct the [[Monster group]], and arises from taking the binary code to be the [[binary Golay code]].
