## Idea 

### Generally

The _product_ of two [[distributions]] is an operation that generalizes, when defined, the ordinary pointwise product of [[functions]] when we think of distributions as [[generalized functions]]. However, as opposed to ordinary functions, the product of distributions is not defined for arbitrary pairs of distributions, but only for those pairs such that the sum of their [[wave front sets]] does not intersect the zero section of the [[cotangent bundle]] ([Hörmander 90, theorem 8.2.10](#Hoermander90)). (The study of distributions with proper attention to their singularity structure via [[wave-front sets]] is known as [[microlocal analysis]]).

There is also the way to  deform the product to make it globally defined, see at _[[Colombeau algebra]]_.

### In perturbative quantum field theory
 {#IdeaInPerturbativeQFT}

The issue of mutliplying distributions has prominently been perceived in [[perturbative quantum field theory]], where [[operator-valued distributions]] serve to give the [[algebra of observables]] such as the [[Wick algebra]] of the [[free fields]] or more generally the [[interacting field algebra]].

A popular impression is (or has been) that the failure of distributions to have a globally defined product is a failure of the mathematical formalism to support the structures needed to model [[perturbative quantum field theory]]. But in fact the opposite is true: Handling the product of distributions correctly via proper analysis of their [[wave front set]] and handling the [[point-extension of distributions]] properly via analysis of their [[scaling degree of a distribution|scaling degree]] leads to a mathematical rigorous construction and mathematically captures all the effects expected from the non-rigorous treatmeants, notably the [[renormalization]] freedom. This is the topic of [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]], see there for more.

###### Definition
**(multiplication of distributions)

Let $u,v \in \mathcal{D}'(X)$ be two [[distributions]] such that the sum of their [[wave front sets]] $WF(u) + WF(v)$  does not intersect zero. Then their _product distribution_

$$
  u \cdot v \in \mathcal{D}'(X)
$$

is the [[pullback of a distribution|pullback]] (via [this prop.](pullback+of+a+distribution#PullbackOfDistributionsWhoseWaveFrontDoesNotIntersectNormalBundle)) of their [[tensor product of distributions|tensor product]] along the [[diagonal]] map $\Delta_X \;\colon\; X \to X \times X$:

$$
  u \cdot v 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \Delta_X^\ast( u \otimes v )
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

Def. \ref{ProductOfDistributions} is indeed well defined.

=--

([Hörmander 90, theorem 8.2.10](#Hoermander90), [Melrose 03, prop. 4.11](#Melrose03))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that the [[pullback of distributions]] is well defined. By [this prop.](pullback+of+a+distribution#PullbackOfDistributionsWhoseWaveFrontDoesNotIntersectNormalBundle) this means to check that the [[wave front set]] of the $u \otimes v$ does not intersect the [[conormal bundle]] of the diagonal map

Now the conormal bundle of the diagonal map consists of those pairs of covectors whose sum vanishes:

$$
  N^\ast_{\Delta_X}
  = 
  \left\{
    (x,(\xi, -\xi))
    \;\vert\;
    \xi \in T^\ast_x X
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by [this example](tensor+product+of+distributions#WaveFrontOfTensorProductDistribution) the wave front set of the tensor product distribution $u \otimes v$ is

$$
  WF(u \otimes v)
  \;\subset\;
  \left(
     WF(u) \times WF(v)
  \right)
    \cup
  \left(
    \left( supp(u) \times \{0\} \right)
    \times WF(v)
  \right)
    \cup
   \left(
     WF(u)
     \times
     \left(
       supp(v) \times \{0\}
     \right)
   \right)
  \,,
$$

Since any wave front set excludes the zero-section by definition, the second and the third summand in this union never intersects the above conormal bundle. The first summand intersects the above conormal bundle precisely if there is a covector in $WF(u)$ which is minus a covector contained in $WF(v)$. That this is not the case is precisely the assumption.

## Non-existence of a global product
 {#NonExistenceOfAGlobalProduct}


The fact that there is no general extension of multiplication to distributions (without condition on the [[wave front set]]) is a famous [[no-go theorem]] of [[Laurent Schwartz]].

A quick way to see the problem is the following: 

Let $H(x)$ be the [[Heaviside function]], we clearly have

$$
      H(x) = H^{n} (x)
$$

where the product on the right side is the product of classical functions. Applying differentiation and the product rule naivly results in a contradiction immediatly:
$$
   \delta(x) = n H^{n-1} (x) \delta(x)
$$

The inconsistency of this product is detected by the [[wave front sets]] as follows: The wave front set both of the [[Heaviside distribution]] as well as of the [[delta distribution]] on the line is $\{(0,k) \vert k \neq 0\}$ ([this example](wavefront+set#WaveFrontOfDeltaDistribution) and [this example](wavefront+set#WaveFrontSetOfHeavisideDistribution)). Therefore for both of these distributions mutliplication is only defined, according to def. \ref{ProductOfDistributions}, with a distribution $u$ for which there exists a [[bump function]] $b$ with $b(0) = 1$ such that $b \cdot u$ is again a bump function. This excludes the products of these distributions with themselves and with each other.
