## Idea 

The _product_ of two [[distributions]] is an operation that generalizes the ordinary pointwise product of [[functions]] when we think of distributions as [[generalized functions]]. However, as opposed to ordinary functions, the product of distributions is not defined for arbitrary pairs of distributions, but only for those pairs such that the sum of their [[wave front sets]] does not intersect the zero section of the [[cotangent bundle]] ([Hörmander 90, theorem 8.2.10](#Hoermander90)).
