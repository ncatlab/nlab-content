## Idea

The _Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture_ is a [[conjecture]] about the form of the first non-vanishing [[derivative]] of the [[Hasse-Weil L-function]] of an [[elliptic curve]] at $s= 1$, expressed in terms of a [[higher regulator]], analogous to the [[class number formula]] for a [[Dedekind zeta function]].

This is hence a conjecture about [[special values of L-functions]]. It influenced the more far-reaching [[Beilinson conjectures]].
