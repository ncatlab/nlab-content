## Idea

A locally presentable category is one where every [[object]] is a [[colimit]] over a [[set]] of [[small object]]s. 


## Definition

There are many equivalent definitions of locally presentable categories.  The following is one of the most intuitive.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (locally presentable category)

A [[category]] $C$ is called **locally presentable** if

* $C$ is [[locally small category]];

* it has all small [[colimits]];

* there exists a [[small set]] $S$ of [[objects]] that generates $C$ under colimits (in the sense that every object of $C$ may be written as a colimit over a diagram with objects in $S$); and

* every object is a [[small object]].

=--

Since a small object is one which is $\kappa$-[[compact object|compact]] for some $\kappa$, and any $\kappa$-compact object is also $\lambda$-compact for any $\lambda\gt\kappa$, it follows that there exists some $\kappa$ such that every object of the colimit-generating set $S$ is $\kappa$-compact.  This provides a "stratification" of the class of locally presentable categories, as follows.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (locally $\kappa$-presentable category)

For $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]], a **locally $\kappa$-presentable category** is a locally presentable category such that the colimit-generating set $S$ may be taken to consist of $\kappa$-compact objects.
=--

Thus, a locally presentable category is one which is locally $\kappa$-presentable for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ (hence also for every $\lambda\gt\kappa$).  In fact, in this case the fourth condition is redundant; once we know that there is a colimit-generating set consisting of $\kappa$-compact objects, it follows automatically that every object is $\lambda$-compact for some $\lambda$ (though there is no uniform upper bound on the required size of $\lambda$).  Moreover, colimit-generation is also stronger than necessary; it suffices to have a [[strong generator]] consisting of small objects.

A locally $(\kappa = \aleph_0)$-presentable category is called a 
**[[locally finitely presentable category]]**.


### Equivalent definitions

There are many other equivalent definitions of locally presentable categories.

###### Proposition (as limit sketches)

Locally presentable categories are precisely the categories of [[sketch|models of limit-sketches]].
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is theorem _xyz_ in _AdRo_ .
=--

This proposition extrapolates part of the Gabriel--Ulmer duality (see below), which concerns [[locally finitely presentable categories]]: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition (as finite limit sketches) 

Locally finitely presentable categories are precisely the categories of 
[[finite limit]] preserving functors $C \to Set$, for small finitely complete categories $C$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition (as accessible reflective subcategories of presheaves)

Locally presentable categories are precisely the [[accessible functor|accessively embedded]] full [[reflective subcategories]] 

$$
  (L \dashv i) 
  :
  C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  PSh(K)
$$

of [[categories of presheaves]] on some category $K$

Where being accessibly embdeed means that $C \hookrightarrow Psh(K)$ is an [[accessible functor]],  which in turn means that $C$ is closed in $Psh(K)$ under $\kappa$-[[filtered colimit]]s for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This appears as proposition 1.46 of 

* Adamek, Rosicky, _Locally presentable and accessible categories_ Cambridge University Press, (1994)
=--


### Gabriel--Ulmer duality 

Let $Lex$ denote the [[2-category]] of small finitely complete categories, finitely continuous (i.e., finite limit preserving) functors, and [[natural transformation]]s between them. 

Let $LFP$ denote the 2-category of locally finitely presentable categories, [[right adjoint]] functors which preserve [[filtered colimit]]s, and natural transformations between them. 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Theorem (Gabriel--Ulmer duality) 

There is a contravariant biequivalence 

$$Lex^{op} \sim LFP$$ 

which sends a finitely complete category $C$ to the category of models of $C$, i.e., the category of left exact functors $C \to Set$.

+--{.query} 
This deserves much further expansion, as it is a basic starting point for the more general study of locally presentable categories. 
=--


### Variations

*  The generalization of the concept to the context of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] is [[presentable (infinity,1)-category]].

* Locally presentable categories are a special case of [[locally bounded category|locally bounded categories]].

### Terminology

The _locally_ in _locally presentable category_ refers to the fact that it is the _objects_ that are presentable, not the category as such.

(For instance, consider the notion of "locally finitely presentable category," in which the generating set $S$ consists of [[finitely presentable object]]s, i.e. $\omega$-small ones. If you drop the word "locally" then you would get "[[finitely presentable category]]" which means something completely different, namely a [[finitely presentable object|finitely presentable]] ($\omega$-small) object of [[Cat]].)

Another notion of "presentable category" is that of an [[equationally presentable category]].

## Examples and applications

### Locally finitely presentable categories

The locally $\kappa$-presentable categories for $\kappa = \aleph_0$.

* [[Set]] is locally finitely presentable: 

  * as the set of generators take the set containing one finite set of cardinality $n \in \mathbb{N}$ for all $n$.

  * every [[set]] is the [[directed colimit]] over the [[poset]] of all its finite [[subset]]s.

  * a set $S \in Set$ is a $\kappa$-[[compact object]] precisely if it has cardinality $|S| \lt \kappa$. So all finite sets are $\aleph_0$-compact. 

* More generally, by Gabriel--Ulmer duality, $Set^C$ is locally finitely presentable if $C$ is small. For, the finite limit completion of $C$, $Lex(C)$, is also small, and $Set^C$ is equivalent to the category of finitely continuous functors $Lex(C) \to Set$. 

* More generally still, if $A$ is locally finitely presentable and $C$ is small, then $A^C$ is locally finitely presentable.

Citation: paper by Lack and Power. Will follow up on this at some point. 
=--

* The category of algebras of a [[Lawvere theory]], for example [[Grp]], is locally finitely presentable. A $T$-algebra $A$ is finitely presented if and only if the hom-functor $Alg_T(A, -)$ preserves filtered colimits, and any $T$-algebra can be expressed as a filtered colimit of finitely presented algebras. 

+-- {: .query} 
This deserves to be expanded upon. 
=--

* The category of coalgebras over a field $k$ is locally finitely presentable; similarly the category of commutative coalgebras over $k$ is locally finitely presentable. 

* a [[poset]], regarded as a category, is locally finitely presentable if it is a complete [[lattice]] which is algebraic (each element is a directed [[join]] of finite elements).

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Counterexamples

* the category [[FinSet]] of _finite_ sets is not locally finitely presentable, as it does not have all countable colimits.

* [[Top]] is not locally finitely presentable.

* The opposite of a locally presentable category (in particular, a locally finitely presentable category) is _never_ locally presentable, unless it is a poset. 
=--


### Locally presentable categories

* A [[poset]], considered as a category, is locally presentable precisely if it is a complete [[lattice]]. 

The following three examples, being presheaf categories, are locally finitely presentable, thus _a fortiori_ locally presentable. They are important for the general study of $(\infty, 1)$-categories. 

* the category [[SSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s;

* the category $dSet$ of [[dendroidal set]]s.

* for $C$ a [[small category]] the [[functor category]] $Funct(C,SSet)$ of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]]. 

More generally,

###### Proposition

A [[Grothendieck topos]] is locally presentable. 
=--

This appears as [Borceux, prop. 3.4.16, page 220](#Borceux).

The main ingredient in the proof is:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ a [[site]] and $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]] strictly larger than the [[cardinality]] of $Mor(C)$, every $\kappa$-[[filtered colimit]] in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(C)$ is computed objectwise.

=--

This implies that all [[representable functor|representables]] are $\kappa$-[[compact objects]]. 

More generally still, we have the following stability theorems: 

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $A$ is locally presentable and $C$ is a [[small category]], then the [[functor category]] $A^C$ is locally presentable. 
=--

+-- {: .num_theorem #AlgebrasOverAnAccessibleMonad}
###### Theorem

If $T$ is an accessible [[monad]] (a monad whose underlying [[functor]] is an [[accessible functor]]) on a locally presentable category $A$, then the category $A^T$ of [[algebras over a monad|algebras over the monad]] is locally presentable. In particular, if $A$ is locally presentable and $i: B \to A$ is a [[reflective subcategory]], then $B$ is locally presentable if $i$ is accessible.

+-- {: .query} 
This is actually somewhat subtle and gets into some transfinite combinatorics, from what I can gather. 
=--


### Combinatorial model categories

A [[combinatorial model category]] is a [[model category]] that is in particular a locally presentable category.


### Orthogonal subcategory problem

Given a class of morphisms $\Sigma$ in a locally presentable category, the answer to the [[orthogonal subcategory problem]] for $\Sigma^\perp$ is affirmative if $\Sigma$ is small, and is affirmative for any class $\Sigma$ assuming the large cardinal axiom known as [[Vopenka's principle]].
