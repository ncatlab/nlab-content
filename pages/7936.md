## Idea

In the context of _[[geometric quantization]]_ the _prequantum space of states_ is a space of [[sections]] of the [[prequantum line bundle]].

The actual space of [[states]] is, after a choice of [[polarization]], hence of "[[canonical coordinates]]" and "[[canonical momenta]]", the subspace of "wave functions that only depend on the canonical coordinates", hence of sections of the prequantum line bundle which are [[covariant derivative|covariantly constant]] along the [[leaves]] of the polarization (the leaves are the "momentum spaces").
