Shelah's main gap is a result in stability theory (part of [[model theory]]), which seeks to identify those [[first-order theories]] whose [[models]] admit some sort of reasonable classification. The 'main gap' describes a fundamental dichotomy between theories. 

Roughly speaking, a countable first-order [[nlab:theory]] belongs to one of the two classes:

* (intractable:) has the maximal number of models in all
sufficiently large cardinalities 

* every model can be decomposed as a tree of countable models

There are some generalizations of this dichotomy beyond first-order theories.
