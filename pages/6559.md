## In quantum field theory

In the [[perturbation theory]] of a [[quantum field theory]] defined by an [[action functional]] $S : Conf \to \mathbb{R}$, a **vacuum** of the theory is a [[classical mechanics|classical]] solution: a configuration $\phi_0 \in Conf$ that solves the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s of $S$.

Because in the perturbative quantum dynamics around $\phi_0$ [[quantum|quanta]] are small deviations from a classical solution. Hence the absence of any quanta, hence the "vacuum", is the solution $\phi_0$ itself.

## In string theory

In [[string theory]] the vacua of the [[effective QFT|effective background QFT]] are at the same time identified with certain 2-dimensional [[CFT]]s -- namely the [[string]] [[sigma-model]]s which have the given [[effective QFT]] as their [[second quantization]].

Perturbative string theory is _defined_ as the [[string perturbation series]] of these [[sigma-models]] about these vacua.

The [[moduli space]] of these vacua -- which is hardly understood -- has come to be called the _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_ .
