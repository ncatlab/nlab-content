## Idea

_Diaconescu's theorem_ is one of central results in [[topos theory]], which says that there exists a natural [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Topos(Sh(X),B C) \simeq Tors(X;C)
$$

where the left side is a category of [[geometric morphism]]s from the [[Grothendieck topos]] $Sh(X)$ of [[sheaves]] over a [[topological space]] $X$ to the [[classifying topos]] $B C$ of a [[small category]] $C$, and the right side is the category of left $C$-[[principal bundle]]s over $X$.
