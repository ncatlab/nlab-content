## Idea

_Diaconescu's theorem_ asserts that any [[presheaf topos]] is the [[classifying topos]] for [[internally flat functor]]s on its [[site]].

Often a special case of this is considered, which assrts that for every [[topological space]] $X$ and [[discrete group]] $G$ there is an [[equivalence of categories]]
 
$$
  Topos(Sh(X),[\mathbf{B}G, Set]) \simeq G Tors(X)
$$

between the [[geometric morphism]]s form the [[sheaf topos]] over $X$ to the category of [[permutation representation]]s of $G$ and the category of $G$-[[torsor]]s on $X$.

## Statement


For $C$ a [[category]], write 

$$
  PSh(C) := [C^{op}, Set]
$$ 

for its [[presheaf topos]]. 

For $\mathcal{E}$ any [[topos]], write

$$
  FlatFunc(C, \mathcal{E}) \hookrightarrow [C, \mathcal{E}]
$$

for the [[full subcategory]] of the [[functor category]] on the [[internally flat functor]].

###### Theorem
**(Diaconescu's theorem)**

There is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Topos(\mathcal{E}, PSh(C))
   \simeq
  FlatFunc(C, \mathcal{E})
$$

between the category of [[geometric morphism]]s $f : \mathcal{E} \to PSh(C)$ and the category of [[internally flat functor]]s $C \to \mathcal{E}$.

This equivalence takes $f$ to the composite

$$
  C \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(C) \stackrel{f^*}{\to} \mathcal{E}
  \,,
$$

where $j$ is the [[Yoneda embedding]] and $f^*$ is the [[inverse image]] of $f$.

###### Remark

If $C$ is a [[finitely complete category]] we may think of it as the [[syntactic category]] and in fact the [[syntactic site]] of an [[essentially algebraic theory]] $\mathbb{T}_C$.  An [[internally flat functor]] $C \to \mathcal{E}$ is then precisely a [[finite limit]] preserving functor, hence is precisely a $\mathbb{T}$-[[model]] in $\mathcal{E}$. 

Therefore the above theorem says in this case that there is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Topos(\mathcal{E}, PSh(C))
   \simeq
  \mathbb{T}_C Mod(\mathcal{E})
$$

between the [[geometric morphism]]s and the $\mathbb{T}$-models in $\mathcal{E}$.

This says that $PSh(C)$ is the [[classifying topos]] for $\mathbb{T}_C$.

###### Remark

If $G$ is a [[discrete group]] and $C = \mathbf{B}G$ is its [[delooping]] [[groupoid]], $PSh(C) \simeq [\mathbf{B}G, Set]$ is the category of [[permutation representation]]s of $G$, also called the [[classifying topos]] of $G$.

In this case an internally flat functor $ C = \mathbf{B}G \to \mathcal{E}$ may be identified with a $G$-[[torsor]] object in $\mathcal{E}$. 

For this reason one sees in the literature sometimes the term "torsor" for internally flat functors out of any category $C$. It is however not so clear in which sense this terminology is helpful in cases where $C$ is not a delooping groupoid or at least _some_ groupoid.
