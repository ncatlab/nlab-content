Diaconescu's theorem is one of central results in topos theory which says that there exists a natural equivalence

$$Top(Sh(X),BC) ~ Tors(X;C)$$

where the left side is a category of geometric morphisms from the Grothendieck topos $St(X)$ of sheaves over a topological space $X$ to the classifying topos $BC$ of a small category $C$, and the right side is the category of left principal $C$-bundles over $X$. The first proof of this result can be found in:
