## Idea

What [[homotopy type theory]] is for [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]], _directed homotopy type theory_ is (or should be) for [[directed homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,n)-category]] [[higher category theory|theory]].

One candidate for full [[omega-categories]] i.e. [[(∞,∞)-categories]] is _[[opetopic type theory]]_.
