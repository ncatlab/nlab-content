In algebraic topology, the slant product is the following pairing between singualar homology and cohomology:
$$
H_q(X,A)\otimes H^n(X\times Y,A')\to H^{n-q}(Y,A\otimes A').
$$ 
It is induced at the chains/cochains level by the Eilenberg-Zilber chain map $$
Chains(X)\otimes Chains(Y)\to Chains(X\otimes Y).$$

When the abelian group $A$ has a commutative ring structure, one can take $A'=A$ and postcompone with $A\otimes A\to A$ to obtain the pairing
$$
H_q(X,A)\otimes H^n(X\times Y,A)\to H^{n-q}(Y,A).
$$
In particular, for $Y=*$ one obtains the contraction
$$
H_q(X,A)\otimes H^n(X,A)\to H^{n-q}(*,A)
$$
taking values in the coefficient ring of the given cohomology theory.
