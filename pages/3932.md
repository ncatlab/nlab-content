

In [[algebraic topology]], the **slant product** is the following pairing between [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]]:

$$
H_q(X,A)\otimes H^n(X\times Y,A')\to H^{n-q}(Y,A\otimes A').
$$ 

It is induced at the chains/cochains level by the [[cochain on a simplicial set|Eilenberg-Zilber chain map]] 

$$
  Chains(X)\otimes Chains(Y)\to Chains(X\times Y).
$$

When the [[abelian group]] $A$ has a commutative ring structure, one can take $A'=A$ and postcompose with $A\otimes A\to A$ to obtain the pairing

$$
H_q(X,A)\otimes H^n(X\times Y,A)\to H^{n-q}(Y,A).
$$

In particular, for $Y=*$ one obtains the contraction

$$
H_q(X,A)\otimes H^n(X,A)\to H^{n-q}(*,A)
$$

taking values in the coefficient ring of the given cohomology theory.
