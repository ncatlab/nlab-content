## Idea

The [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] version of [[de Rham cohomology]].

## Properties

### Models

Various different [[dg-algebras]] are used to model equivariant de Rham cohomology, known as 

* the _Cartan model_

* the _Kalkman model_

## Related concepts

* [[gauged WZW model]]

## References

The Cartan model is reviewed and another model is constructed in
