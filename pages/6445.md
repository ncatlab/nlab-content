## Idea 

The concept of *matroid*, due to Hassler Whitney, is one of the basic structures of combinatorics, giving several different ways of encoding/defining and presenting a general notion of "independence", e.g., linear independence in a vector space, algebraic independence in a field extension, etc. 

There is also a similar concept of an [[oriented matroid]]; every oriented matroid has an underlying matroid. 

## Definitions 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
A **matroid** on a set $X$ is a [[Moore closure|closure operator]] $C: P(X) \to P(X)$ satisfying the _exchange axiom_: if $a \in C(S \cup\{b\}) \cap \neg C(S)$, then $b \in C(S \cup\{a\}) \cap \neg C(S)$.

Usually when combinatorialists speak of matroids as such, $X$ is taken to be a finite set. A typical example is $X$ some finite subset of a vector space $V$, taking $C(S) \coloneqq X \cap Span(S)$ for any $S \subseteq X$. 

Under this definition, a subset $S \subseteq X$ is _independent_ if there is a strict inclusion $C(T) \subset C(S)$ for every strict inclusion $T \subset S$ (this is the same as requiring $x \notin C(S\backslash \{x\})$ for every $x \in S$). Again under this definition, $S$ is a _basis_ if $C(S) = X$ and $S$ is independent. A _hyperplane_ is a closed subset $S$ (meaning $C(S) = S$) that is maximal among proper closed subsets of $X$. It is possible to axiomatize the notion of matroid by taking bases as the primitive notion, or independent sets as the primitive notion, or hyperplanes as the primitive notion, etc. -- Rota (after Birkhoff) speaks of _cryptomorphism_ between these differing definitions. Much of the power and utility of matroid theory comes from this multiplicity of definitions and the possibility of moving seamlessly between them; for example, a matroid structure might be easy to detect from the viewpoint of one definition, but not from another.

###### Proposition 
Any two bases of a matroid have the same cardinality, called the _dimension_ of the matroid.

## Examples 

Vector spaces, algebraic closures, graphs, restrictions, localizations, ... 

## Model-theoretic geometry 

Essentially the very same notion arises in model theory, except instead of being called a matroid it is called a "geometry". It arises in the study of geometry of strongly minimal sets, with applications to stability theory (i.e., Shelah's classification theory).

###### Definition 
A _pregeometry_ is a (possibly infinite) matroid (given by a set $X$ equipped with a closure operator $C$) such that for all $S \subseteq X$, if $x \in C(S)$ then $x \in C(S_0)$ for some finite subset $S_0 \subseteq S$. A **geometry** is a pregeometry such that $C(\emptyset) = \emptyset$ and $C(\{x\}) = \{x\}$ for every $x \in X$.

## Mnev's theorem 

Mnëv's universality theorem says that any [[semialgebraic set]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined over integers is stably equivalent to the realization space of some oriented matroid.
