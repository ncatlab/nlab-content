A *well-connected* [[topological space]] is one that satisfies sufficiently strong local connectivity assumptions. These are usually defined in terms of a basis of open sets or a basis of neighbourhoods of the space. Note that this term is not universally defined, but is a placeholder for possibly more complicated adjectives that depend on the situation at hand.

## Examples ##

* A [[locally path-connected space]] has the nice property that path-components are the same as components. It is also true in this case that $X^I \to X\times X$ is an open map.

* A locally path-connected and [[semi-locally simply-connected space]] admits a [[universal covering space]].

* The path fibration $PX \to X$ of a [[path-connected space]] admits local sections if and only if $X$ is [[locally contractible space|locally contractible]].

* [[CW complex]]es are the most well-connected spaces, having a contractible basis of open sets (which is stronger than local contractibility).
