## Idea

A _smooth locus_ is the [[duality|formal dual]] of a finitely generated [[smooth algebra]] (or $C^\infty$-ring):

a [[space]] that behaves as if its algebra of functions is a finitely generated [[smooth algebra]].


Given that a [[smooth algebra]] is a smooth refinement of an ordinary [[ring]] with a morphism from $\mathbb{R}$, a smooth locus is the analog in [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|well-adapted models]] for [[synthetic differential geometry]] for what in [[algebraic geometry]] is an [[affine variety]] over $\mathbb{R}$.

## Definition

A finitely generated [[smooth algebra]] is one of the form $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/J$, for $J$ an ideal of the ordinary underlying algebra.

Write $C^\infty Ring^{fin}$ for the [[category]] of finitely generated smooth algebras. 

Then the [[opposite category]] $\mathbb{L} := (C^\infty Ring^{fin})^{op}$ is the [[category]] of **smooth loci**.



### Notation

For $A \in C^\infty Ring^{fin}$ one write $\ell A$ for the corresponding object in $\mathbb{L}$.

Often one also write

$$
  R := \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{R})
$$ 

for the real line regarded as an object of $\mathbb{L}$. 

## Properties 

The category $\mathbb{L}$ has the following properties:

###### Proposition

The canonical inclusion functor

$$
  SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbb{L}
$$

$$
  X \mapsto \mathcal{l}C^\infty(X)
$$

from the category [[Diff|SmthMfd]] of [[smooth manifolds]] is a [[full subcategory]] embedding (i.e. a [[full and faithful functor]]. Moreover, it preserves [[pullbacks]] along [[transversal maps]].

###### Proposition

The [[Tietze extension theorem]] holds in $\mathbb{L}$: $R$-valued functions on closed subobjects in $\mathbb{L}$ have an extension.

## Applications 

There are various [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] on $\mathbb{L}$ and various of its subcategories, such that [[category of sheaves|categories of sheaves]] on these are [[smooth topos]]es that are well-adapted models for [[synthetic differential geometry]].
