# Idea #

Given an [[algebraic theory]] $V$, a $V$-algebra is a model of $V$ in the category $Set$.  A _Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid_ is _the kind of thing that acts on $V$-algebras_.

###### Definition
Let $V$ be an [[algebraic theory]] and let $V Alg$ be the category of models of this theory in $Set$.  Then a **Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid** is a [[monoid|monoid object]] in the category of co-$V$-objects in $V Alg$.

To see why these are _what acts on $V$-algebras_ one needs to understand what a co-$V$-object in $V Alg$ actually is.
A co-$V$-object in some category $D$ is a [[representable functor|representable covariant functor]] from $D$ to $V Alg$.
To give a particular $D$-object, $d$, the structure of a co-$V$-object is to give a lift of the $Set$-valued $Hom$-functor $D(d,-)$ to $V Alg$.
Thus a co-$V$-object in $V Alg$ is a representable covariant functor from $V Alg$ to itself.

One can therefore consider composition of such representable covariant functors.
The main result of this can be simply stated:

###### Proposition
The composition of representable covariant functors $V Alg \to V Alg$ is again representable.
=--

This is a basic result in general algebra, and is not stated here in its full generality.

An almost corollary of this is that the category of representable covariant functors from $V Alg$ to itself is monoidal (the "almost" refers to the fact that you have to show that the identity functor is representable, but this is not hard).

Thus for two co-$V$-algebra objects in $V$, say $R_1$ and $R_2$, there is a product $R_1 \odot R_2$ and a natural isomorphism

$$
Hom_V(R_1 \odot R_2,A) \cong Hom_V(R_1, Hom_V(R_2,A))
$$

for any $V$-algebra, $A$.

A Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid is thus a triple $(P,\mu,\eta)$ with $\mu : P \odot P \to P$ and $\eta : I \to P$ (where $I$ is the free $V$-algebra on one element --- this represents the identity functor), satisfying the obvious coherence diagrams.
An action of $P$ on a $V$-algebra, say $A$, is then a morphism $\rho : P \odot A \to A$ again satisfying certain coherence diagrams.

Ah, but I have not told you what $P \odot A$ is!
At the moment, one can take the "product" of two co-$V$-algebra objects in $V Alg$ but now I want to take the product of a co-$V$-algebra object with a $V$-algebra.
How do I do this?
I do this by observing that a $V$-algebra is a _co-$Set$-algebra object in $V Alg$_!
That's a complicated way of saying that $V$ represents a covariant functor $V Alg \to Set$.
Precomposing this with the functor represented by $P$ yields again a covariant functor $V Alg \to Set$.
This is again representable and we write its representing object $P \odot A$.

As an aside, we note that this defines a bifunctor $VV^c \times V \to V$ which is an action of the monoidal category $VV^c$ on $V$.
This can be extended to an action of $VV^c$ on the categories of $V$-algebra and co-$V$-algebra objects in a reasonably arbitrary base category.

One postscript to this is that although the category of co-$V$-algebra objects in $V Alg$ is not a variety of algebras, for a specific Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid $P$, the category of $P$-modules _is_ a variety of algebras.



# Examples #

* If $V$ is the theory of [[commutative ring|commutative unital rings]], a $V$-algebra is a commutative unital ring, and the corresponding sort of Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid is called a [[biring]].  

* If $V$ is the theory of [[commutative algebra|commutative associative algebras]] over a [[field]] $k$, then a $V$-algebra is a commutative associative algebra over $k$, and the corresponding sort of Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid is called a [[plethory]].

* If $V$ is the theory of [[abelian group|abelian groups]], than a $V$-algebra is an abelian group, and the corresponding sort of Tall--Wraith $V$-monoid is a [[ring]].
To see this, we need to think about the category of _co-abelian group objects in abelian groups_.
These are abelian groups $A$ together with morphisms of abelian groups

$$
\Delta : A \to A \coprod A, \epsilon A \to I
$$

where $I$ is the initial object in the category of abelian groups (thus, the coproduct over an empty indexing set).
These have to satisfy certain obvious coherences.

We have that $I = \{0\}$.
Thus $\epsilon$ is forced to be the map that sends everything to $0$.

We also have that $A \coprod A = A \oplus A$.
That means that for $a \in A$, $\Delta(a) = a_1 + a_2$ for some $a_1, a_2 \in A$.
Now one of the coherences is that $\epsilon$ is a counit for $\Delta$.
This means that $(\epsilon \oplus 1) \Delta = 1$ and similarly for $1 \oplus \epsilon$.
Thus $a_1 = a_2 = a$ and $\Delta$ is the diagonal map.

It is simple to show that the triple $(A, \Delta, \epsilon)$ with $\Delta$ the diagonal map and $\epsilon$ the zero map _is_ a co-abelian group object in the category of abelian groups.
Thus the category of co-abelian group objects in the category of abelian groups is isomorphic, via the obvious forgetful functor, to the category of abelian groups.

It is part of the general theory that the category of co-$V$-objects in $V$ is monoidal (though not, in general, symmetric).
For details on this (for the moment) see _The Hunting of the Hopf Ring_.
This monoidal structure for abelian groups turns out to be the tensor product.

Thus a _Tall--Wraith monoid_ for abelian groups is actually an ordinary monoid in the category of abelian groups; in other words, a [[ring]].

[[John Baez]]: The above material is tentative, based on things I heard [on the $n$-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025550), but may not have understood. 

[[Andrew Stacey]]: looks okay to me.  I put in lots of "commutative"s in the examples because the original papers in both cases dealt with commutative cases and I thought it best that the examples were as close as possible to the originals.  I also changed the $V$ to $\mathcal{V}$ in line with the notation from _The Hunting of the Hopf Ring_.  Should there be a lab standard on fonts for categories, objects, functors, and the like?

_Toby_:  Based on [this discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=37), ‘$\mathcal{V}$’ is more likely to cause problems for people that haven\'t installed appropriate fonts.  (Not that I\'m changing it back, mind you ....)

[[John Baez]]: I hate 'fancy fonts for fancy gizmos', because they mainly serve to make gizmos seem fancy and intimidating.  That's why I had changed $\mathcal{V}$ to $V$.  I think I'll change it back again, just to annoy Andrew.  It's just a category with products, for god's sake!  Surely we can't insist on calligraphic font whenever we see one of those: must we say $\mathcal{Set}$?  (Yes, I'm being ornery.)

[[Andrew Stacey]]: Okay, okay, I surrender!  I'll even change back the ones that you missed.

But I reject the charge of 'fancy fonts for fancy gizmos'.  My intention was to use the change of fonts to represent the relationships between things.  Thus $a$ is an element of $A$ which is an object of $\mathcal{A}$ which is mapped by the functor $\mathfrak{A}$.  It's a bit like using $m,n$ for natural numbers.  Yes, we can and often do use $a$ for a natural number, but if I scan a page and see $n$ then I automatically think "natural number" (okay, maybe integer).  Since that is reasonably widespread, authors can use it to make their work clearer so that the reader doesn't continually have to go back to the first page to work out whether $A$ was the category or the object.  Of course we _can_ write

$$
\forall \delta \forall x \gt 0 \exists y \gt 0 : \forall \epsilon, |\epsilon - \delta| \lt y \implies |f(\epsilon) - f(\delta)| \lt x
$$

but, frankly, wouldn't you rather we didn't?
