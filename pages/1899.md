# Idea #

Given an [[algebraic theory]] $V$, a $V$-algebra is a model of $V$ in the category $Set$.  A 'Tall-Wraith monoid' is _the kind of thing that acts on $V$-algebras_.  

# Definition #

Let $V$ be an [[algebraic theory]] and let $V-alg$ be the category of models of this theory in $Set$.  Then a **Tall-Wraith monoid** is a [[monoid|monoid object]] in the category of co-$V$-objects in $V-alg$.   

# Example #

* If $V$ is the theory of rings, a $V$-algebra is a ring, and the corresponding sort of Tall-Wraith monoid is called a [[biring]].  

* If $V$ is the theory of associative algebras over a field $k$, then a $V$-algebra is an associative algebra over $k$, and the corresponding sort of Tall-Wraith monoid is called a [[plethory]].
