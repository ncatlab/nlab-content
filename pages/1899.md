# Idea #

Given an [[algebraic theory]] $\mathcal{V}$, a $\mathcal{V}$-algebra is a model of $\mathcal{V}$ in the category $Set$.  A _Tall--Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid_ is _the kind of thing that acts on $\mathcal{V}$-algebras_.  


# Definition #

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be an [[algebraic theory]] and let $\mathcal{V} Alg$ be the category of models of this theory in $Set$.  Then a **Tall--Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid** is a [[monoid|monoid object]] in the category of co-$\mathcal{V}$-objects in $\mathcal{V} Alg$.   


# Examples #

* If $\mathcal{V}$ is the theory of [[commutative ring|commutative unital rings]], a $\mathcal{V}$-algebra is a commutative unital ring, and the corresponding sort of Tall--Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid is called a [[biring]].  

* If $\mathcal{V}$ is the theory of [[commutative algebra|commutative associative algebras]] over a [[field]] $k$, then a $\mathcal{V}$-algebra is a commutative associative algebra over $k$, and the corresponding sort of Tall--Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid is called a [[plethory]].

[[John Baez]]: The above material is tentative, based on things I heard [on the $n$-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025550), but may not have understood. 

[[Andrew Stacey]]: looks okay to me.  I put in lots of "commutative"s in the examples because the original papers in both cases dealt with commutative cases and I thought it best that the examples were as close as possible to the originals.  I also changed the $V$ to $\mathcal{V}$ in line with the notation from _The Hunting of the Hopf Ring_.  Should there be a lab standard on fonts for categories, objects, functors, and the like?

_Toby_:  Based on [this discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=37), ‘$\mathcal{V}$’ is more likely to cause problems for people that haven\'t installed appropriate fonts.  (Not that I\'m changing it back, mind you ....)
