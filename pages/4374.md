Given a [[set]] $X$ and a [[subset]] $A$ of $X$, the __inclusion function__ of $A$ in $X$ is the [[function]] $i_A\colon A \to X$ given by
$$ i_A(n) = n $$
for every [[element]] $n$ of $X$ that belongs to $A$.

Every inclusion function is an [[injection]], and every injection is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (in the [[slice category]] $Set/X$) to an inclusion function.

In appropriate categories, it is common to analogously interpret [[monomorphisms]] or [[regular monomorphisms]] as inclusions of [[subobjects]].
