#Idea#

A Lie $\infty$-groupoid is supposed to be an [[infinity-groupoid|∞-groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] a suitable category of [[generalized smooth spaces]]. 

Following the general idea of [[space and quantity]] and [[generalized smooth space]]s one may identify smooth $\infty$-groupoids with [[smooth infinity-stack]]s.

But notice that the traditional notion called [[Lie groupoid]] is more restritive than a 1-coskeletal [[smooth ∞-stack]].

#Remarks#

The details usually depend on which aspect of higher [[Lie theory]] one wants to capture.

One wants Lie $\infty$-groupoids to be nicely related to [[Lie ∞-algebroids]]. This is discussed at [[(∞,1)-quantity]].
