## Idea

Hilbert modular forms are one generalization of the concept of _[[modular form]]_ to functions of more than one complex variable. (Another such generalization are [[Siegel modular forms]].)

Just as modular forms are, locally, functions on the [[moduli space of elliptic curves]] over the [[complex numbers]], soHilbert modular forms are locally functions on moduli spaces of something like complex [[abelian varieties]] with real multiplication and polarization module ([Goren, p. 49](#Goren)). 

Hilbert modular forms have a slick equivalent formulation as adelic [[automorphic forms]]. (...)
