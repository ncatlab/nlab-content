## Idea

The [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] relates [[simplicial groups]] to [[chain complexes]]. The _Eilenberg-Zilber theorem_ says how in this context [[double complexes]] and their [[total complexes]] relate to [[bisimplicial sets|bisimplicial groups]] and their [[diagonal of a bisimplicial set|diagonals]]/[[total simplicial sets]].

Analogously there is also a version of the theorem for bi-cosimplicial abelian groups.

## Statement

### Simplicial version

Let $A : \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \to Ab$ be a [[bisimplicial object|bisimplicial abelian group]]. Write 

* $C_\bullet diag A$ for the [[Moore complex]] of its diagonal simplicial group $diag A : \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \stackrel{A}{\to} Ab$;

* $Tot (C A)$ for the [[total complex]] of the [[double complex]] obtained by applying the [[Moore complex]] functor on both arguments of $A$.

###### Theorem
**(Dold-Puppe generalization of Eilenberg-Zilber)**

There is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] (even a chain-[[homotopy equivalence]])

$$
  R : C_\bullet diag (A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Tot C (A)
  \,.
$$

###### Remark


Notice (see the discussion at [[bisimplicial set]]) that the diagonal simplicial set is isomorphic to the [[nerve and realization|realization]] given by the [[coend]]

$$
  diag F_{\bullet,\bullet} 
  \simeq 
   \int^{[n] \in \Delta} \Delta^n \times F_{n,\bullet}
  \,.
$$

=--


### Cosimplicial version


Let $A : \Delta \times \Delta \to Ab$ be a bi-cosimplicial abelian group. And let $C : Ab^\Delta \to Ch^\bullet$ the Moore cochain complex functor. Write $C(A)$ for the [[double complex]] obtained by applying $C$ to each of the two cosimplicial directions. Then we have natural isomorphisms in cohomology

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

There is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  H^\bullet C^\bullet diag(A)
  \simeq
  H^\bullet Tot C^\bullet(A)
$$

## Applications 

### Homology groups of products of topological spaces {#ProdTopSp}

This is the original motivating application.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two [[topological space]]s. Their [[chain homology]] complexes $C_\bullet(X)$ and $C_\bullet(Y)$ are the [[Moore complex]]es of the simplicial abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}[Sing X]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[Sing Y]$. So from the Dold-Puppe [[quasi-isomorphism]] $R$ from above we have a [[quasi-isomorphism]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    C_\bullet(X \times Y)
    & :=
    C_\bullet( \mathbb{Z}[Sing X \times Sing Y] )
    \\
    &=
    C_\bullet( diag \mathbb{Z}[Sing X_\bullet] 
      \otimes \mathbb{Z}[Sing Y_\bullet] )
    \\
    & \stackrel{R}{\to_\simeq}
    Tot C_\bullet(\mathbb{Z}[Sing X]) \otimes C_\bullet(\mathbb{Z}[Sing Y])
    \\
    & = Tot C_\bullet(X) \otimes C_\bullet(Y) 
  \end{aligned}
$$

and hence in particular an isomorphism in cohomology.
