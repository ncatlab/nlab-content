## Idea

The notion of __Cartan connection__ is a special case of that of _[[connection on a bundle]]_ which is more general than the notion of _[[affine connection]]_ , but more special than the notion of _[[principal connection]]_ , in general: 

it is an $G$-[[principal connection]] subject to the constraint that the connection 1-form linearly identifies each [[tangent space]] of the base space with a quotient $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$ of the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ by a sub-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$.

The [[fiber]] of the [[bundle]] underlying a  Cartan connection is a [[homogeneous space]]. This notion is closely related to [[Klein geometry|Klein geometries]]. 

Cartan connections are also just called _[[Cartan geometries]]_ . 



## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] and $H \hookrightarrow G$  a sub-Lie group. (So that we may think of the [[coset space]] $G/H$ as a [[Klein geometry]].) Write $\mathfrak{h} \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{g}$ for the corresponding [[Lie algebras]].

###### Definition

A $(H \hookrightarrow G)$-Cartan connection over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is;

* a $G$-[[affine connection]] $\nabla$ on $X$;

* such that 

  1. there is a [[reduction of structure groups]] along $H \hookrightarrow G$;

  1. for each point $x \in X$ the canonical composite (for any local trivialization)

     $$
       T_x X \stackrel{\nabla}{\to} \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}
     $$

     is an [[isomorphism]].

This appears for instance as ([Sharpe, section 5.1](#Sharpe)).

## Examples

### (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry

Let $G = Iso(d,1)$ be the [[Poincare group]] and $H \subset G$ the [[orthogonal group]] $O(d,1)$. Then the quotient

$$
  \mathfrak{iso}(d,1)/\mathfrak{so}(d,1) \simeq
  \mathbb{R}^{d+1}
$$

is [[Lorentzian spacetime]]. Therefore an $(O(d,1)\hookrightarrow Iso(d,1))$-Cartan connection is equivalently an $O(d,1)$-connection on a manifold whose [[tangent space]]s look like [[Minkowski spacetime]]: this is  equivalently a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] from the perspective discussed at [[first-order formulation of gravity]]:

the $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$-valued part of the connection is the [[vielbein]].
