__Cartan connection__ is a special case of a [[connection on a bundle]] which is more general than [[affine connection]], but more special than the [[principal connection]] in general. The fiber of a Cartan connection is a [[homogeneous space]]. This notion is closely related to [[Klein geometry|Klein geometries]]. [[Élie Cartan]] has introduced Cartan connections in his work on the Cartan's "method of moving frames" (cf. [[Cartan geometry]]).
