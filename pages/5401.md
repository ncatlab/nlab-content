In [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]_ there is discussion of the _[[cohesion]]_ of some substance. [[William Lawvere]] argued that the "[[objective logic]]" of this discussion is to be formalized via [[categorical logic]] by the axiomatics of [[cohesive toposes]], i.e. by [[modal type theory]] equipped with [[shape modality]] and [[flat modality]].


Entries discussing aspects of _cohesion_ include the following

* [[motivation for cohesion]], [[geometry of physics]]

* [[cohesive topos]]

  * [[cohesive site]]

* [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]], [[cohesive homotopy type theory]],
 
  * [[∞-cohesive site]]

 * [[differential cohesion]]


Hegel goes on to speak of cohesion being refined to _[[elasticity]]_:

> [PN§297Zusatz](Science+of+Logic#PN297Zusatz) Elasticity is the whole of cohesion.

Moreover, according to [PN§298](Science+of+Logic#PN298) this elasticity is related to the [[unity of opposites]] that consistute [[Zeno's paradox of motion]], hence to the modern concept of [[differentiation]] via a [[limit of a sequence]].  In terms of [[categorical logic]] this is precisely what is encoded in the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] and [[infinitesimal flat modality]] of
