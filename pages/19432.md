## Idea

Among the possible $\frac{1}{8}$-[[BPS states]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] is one where three [[black brane|black]] [[M2-branes]] jointly [[intersecting brane|intersect]] at equal angles ([Tseytlin 96](#Tseytlin96))

$$
  M2 \perp M2 \perp M2
  \,.
$$

This is the lift to [[M-theory]] of 3-string junctions in [[type IIB string theory]] ([Krogh-Lee 97](#KroghLee97), [Ramadevi 99](#Ramadevi99)), see at _[[string network]]_.

## Properties

### Triple generalization of Chan-Paton factors

Since [[black brane|black]] [[M2-branes]] may also end on [[M5-branes]], in an M-theory lift of how [[strings]] end on [[D-branes]] as quanta of [[super Yang-Mills theory]], there was the suggestion that this points to a generalization of [[gauge theories]] where [[matrix Lie algebras]] (matrices of [[Chan-Paton gauge field|Chan-Paton factors]]) are enhanced to some kind of higher or hypermatrix structure ([FLST 10](#FLST10)).

### Gauge enhancement at ADE-Singularities

If one accepts the traditional story of the [[M-theory lift of gauge enhancement on D6-branes]], in terms of [[M2-branes]] [[wrapped brane|wrapping]] [[2-spheres]] that touch along the shape of a [[Dynkin diagram]] [[blowup]] of an [[ADE-singularity]],

then such triple membrane junctions must correspond to blowups of the [[dihedral group|dihedral]], [[tetrahedral group|tetrahedral]], [[octahedral group|octahedral]] or [[icosahedral group|icosahedral]] [[ADE-singularities]], since in these cases the [[Dynkin diagram]] has a triple junction node :
