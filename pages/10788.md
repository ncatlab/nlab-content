## Idea

The _analytic topology_ on an complex [[analytic space]] is the one given by [[covering]] the space by affine opens equipped with the standard [[topology]] induced from that of the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}^n$.

## Properties

### Riemann existence theorem

* [[Riemann existence theorem]]

### Comparison theorem

The [[comparison theorem (étale cohomology)]] relates the [[étale cohomology]] of a [[complex variety]] with the [[ordinary cohomology]] of its complex analytic topological space.
