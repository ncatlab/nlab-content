Given a ring $R$ (or some analogue, say a Banach algebra), 
a submodule $K$ of an $R$-module $M$ is called
__superfluous__ or small in $M$, written $K \lt\lt M$, 
if, for every submodule $L\subset M$ , the equality $K + L = M$ implies $L = M$.
An epimorphism $f : M\to N$ is called superfluous (or coessential) if $Ker f \lt\lt M$.

Superfluous epimorphisms (submodules) are a notion dual to essential monomorphisms
(submodules); their role in the study of [[projective cover]]s is analogous to
the role of essential monomorphisms in the study of [[injective envelope]]s.
