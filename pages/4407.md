## Statement

Classically, the **fundamental theorem of algebra** states that 

* The [[field]] of [[complex number]]s $\mathbb{C}$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In other words, every polynomial with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$ has a root in $\mathbb{C}$. 

Many proofs of this theorem are known; some use [[complex analysis]] (the reciprocal of a [[polynomial]] cannot be bounded), some use [[algebraic topology]] (the degree of a map is invariant with respect to homotopy), and some use advanced calculus (polynomial functions on the complex numbers are [[open map|open mappings]]). All of these proofs involve, at some level, the fact that the real numbers are [[Dedekind real number|Dedekind complete]], which has as a classical consequence the fact that the real numbers are [[archimedean field|archimedean]]. 


## Algebraic proof via real closed fields 

Despite its name, the fundamental theorem of algebra makes reference to a concept from [[analysis]] (the field of complex numbers).  However, the analytic part may be reduced to a minimum: that the field of [[real numbers]] is [[real closed field|real closed]].  This has been known essentially forever, and is easily proved using (for example) the [[intermediate value theorem]].

The rest of the proof is algebraic and, unlike the other proof methods, applies to all [[real closed field]]s, which need not be archimedean. It is due to [[Emil Artin]], and forms a basic chapter in the Artin--Schreier theory of real closed fields.

We recall that a _real closed field_ is an [[ordered field]] such that every positive element has a [[square root]], and every polynomial of odd degree has a root. Clearly the polynomial $x^2 + 1$ has no root in a real closed field.

###### Theorem 
If $F$ is real closed, then $K = F[\sqrt{-1}]$ is algebraically closed. 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We must show that any [[irreducible polynomial]] $p$ with coefficients in $K$ has a root in $K$. 

The [[splitting field]] of $p$ is a finite [[Galois extension]] $L$ of $F$, with [[Galois group]] $G$. If $G(2)$ is the [[Sylow group|Sylow 2-group]] of $G$, then the [[fixed field]] of $G(2)$ is an odd degree extension of $F$, given by the splitting field of an odd degree irreducible polynomial $q$ over $F$. But since $F$ is real closed, $q$ has a root in $F$; by irreducibility, the degree must be $1$, so that in fact $G = G(2)$. We have ${|G|} \gt 1$ since the splitting field contains $K$. 

So $G$ is a $2$-[[primary group]]. But for any [[prime number]] $p$, a nontrivial finite $p$-group has nontrivial [[center]], and is therefore [[solvable group|solvable]] by an inductive argument. Therefore the extension $L/F$ arises from a tower of non-trivial [[quadratic extension]]s 

$$F \subseteq L_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq L_n = L$$ 

By the [[quadratic formula]], the first field $L_1$ arises by adjoining roots to $F$ of a polynomial $x^2 + a x + b$, 

$$\frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2},$$ 

where $a^2 - 4b$ is negative. Since $F$ is real closed, the positive element $4b - a^2$ has a square root in $F$, so that the roots displayed above belong to $K = F[\sqrt{-1}]$. So $L_1 = K$. But $K$ has no nontrivial quadratic extensions by the lemma that follows, so in fact $L_1 = L_n = K$ and the theorem is proved.

###### Lemma 
Every element of $K = F[\sqrt{-1}]$ has a square root in $K$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The proof is most easily apprehended by analogy with polar coordinate representations of complex numbers and half-angle formulas, where a square root of $r e^{i\theta}$ is given by $r^{1/2}e^{i\theta /2}$. Let $i$ be a fixed square root of $-1$, and let $a + b i$ be an arbitrary element of $K$, with $a, b \in F$. We must solve $(x + y i)^2 = a + b i$, i.e., find $x, y \in F$ such that 

$$x^2 - y^2 = a, \qquad 2x y = b$$ 

Since $a^2 + b^2$ has a square root in $F$, we may assume without loss of generality that $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. By interchanging $x$ and $y$ if necessary, we may assume $a \geq 0$; by replacing $y$ by $-y$ if necessary, we may also assume $b \geq 0$. Since $0 \leq a \leq 1$, we may choose nonnegative $x$ and $y$ such that 

$$x^2 = \frac{1+a}{2}, \qquad y^2 = \frac{1-a}{2}$$ 

and this provides the solution.

## Classical FTA via advanced calculus 

As noted above, many proofs of the fundamental theorem are known. The following proof has the advantage that it requires very little machinery; it hardly uses anything not known by [[Karl Gauss|Gauss]][^1]. 

[^1]: Maybe the bit involving compactness wasn't available in Gauss's time. It would be interesting to write this bit out so that the entire proof would be understood by an eighteenth-century mathematician. 

Let $f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ be a polynomial mapping, and suppose $f$ has no zero. 

1. First, ${|f(z)|}$ attains an absolute (positive) minimum. For, choose any $z' \in \mathbb{C}$. Since $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = \infty$, there exists some [[compact subspace|compact]] [[ball]] $B$ containing $z'$ so that ${|f(z)|} \gt {|f(z')|}$ whenever $z \notin B$. By compactness, ${|f(z)|}$ attains an absolute minimum for $z$ ranging over $B$; by choice of $B$, it is the same minimum as for $z$ ranging over all of $\mathbb{C}$. 

2. Suppose ${|f|}$ attains an absolute minimum at $z = z_0$. The polynomial $f$ may be uniquely written in the form 
$$f(z) = f(z_0) + (z - z_0)^n g(z)$$ 
where $g$ is polynomial and $g(z_0) \neq 0$. Put 
$$F(z) = f(z_0) + g(z_0)(z - z_0)^n$$ 
and choose $\delta \gt 0$ small so that 
$${|z - z_0|} = \delta \Rightarrow {|g(z) - g(z_0)|} \lt {|g(z_0)|}$$ 

3. $F$ maps the circle $C = \{z : {|z - z_0|} = \delta\}$ onto a circle of radius $r = {|g(z_0)|}\delta^n$ centered at $f(z_0)$. (This uses the fact that any complex number has an $n^{th}$ root, which one can prove using polar coordinate representations. We omit the details.) Choose $z' \in C$ so that $F(z')$ is on the line segment between the origin and $f(z_0)$. Then 
$${|F(z')|} = {|f(z_0)|} - r$$
We also have 
$${|f(z') - F(z')|} = {|g(z') - g(z_0)|} {|z' - z_0|^n} \lt {|g(z_0)|} \delta^n = r$$ 
according to how we chose $\delta$. We conclude by observing 
$${|f(z')|} \leq {|F(z')|} + {|f(z') - F(z')|} \lt {|f(z_0)|} - r + r = {|f(z_0)|},$$ 
which yields the desired contradiction.  


## In weak foundations

Many proof rely explicitly on the [[double negation]] rule by first supposing that a polynomial $p$ has no root and deriving a contradiction.  However, the algebraic proof is almost entirely [[constructive mathematics|constructive]].  (Some of the general results on splitting fields are problematic in constructive algebra, but what we need here is fine.)

In fact, the only problem is Lemma \ref{sqrt}.  This may fail in a [[topos]] (such as [[sheaves]] over $\mathbb{C}$), since we not be able to find a square root of a complex number $x$ (or element of $K[\sqrt{-1}]$ more generally) if we do not whether or not $x$ is apart from zero (because there is no [[continuous map|continuous]] square-root function).

Most varieties of [[constructive mathematics]] (including that in [[Errett Bishop]]\'s book) nevertheless accept the FTA, because the needed square roots follow from [[weak countable choice]] ($WCC$, which is a consequence of either excluded middle or [[countable choice]]).  A fully choice-free constructive proof also exists for the [[Cauchy real number|Cauchy complex numbers]] (which agree with the [[Dedekind real number|Dedekind complex numbers]] by $WCC$).

[[Fred Richman]] ([1998](#Richman)) has proposed that, in the absence of $WCC$, the FTA should be interepreted as a statement about sets of roots rather than about individual roots.  He constructs a [[complete metric space]] $\hat{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ which, classically, is the space of $n$-element [[multisets]] of complex numbers (and constructively is the completion of that space) and proves that every complex polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ may be associated with a point in this space in such a way that the $n$ elements of that point (when viewed as a multiset, if possible, and morally in any case) are the $n$ roots of $p$.
