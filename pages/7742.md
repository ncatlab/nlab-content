## Idea
In a model $M$ of a first-order theory $T$ a definable set $G$ might have additional algebraic stucture (e.g. that of a [[group]], [[ring]], [[groupoid]], [[category]], etc.) also given by definable functions and predicates. Since this set with extra structure is given by some collection of formulas in the language of $T$, it is interpreted in every model of $T$, and is hence an invariant of the [[syntactic category]] (walking model) $\mathbf{Def}(T)$ of $T$.

## Definition
To make this precise:

* A definable group is just a [[group object]] in $\mathbf{Def}(T)$.
* A definable groupoid is just a groupoid object, i.e. an [[internal groupoid]] in $\mathbf{Def}(T)$.
* A definable ring is just a semigroup object in the category of abelian group objects of $\mathbf{Def}(T)$.
* A definable category is just a category object, i.e. an [[internal category]] in $\mathbf{Def}(T)$.

Since groups, groupoids, rings, and categories can be given by algebraic theories, a definition (modulo having [[elimination of imaginaries|EI]]) of one of these in $T$ is just an interpretation of one of those theories in $T$ is just a logical functor from the walking models of one of these to $\mathbf{Def}(T)$.

### Remarks
* Evaluating the unit of the [[Makkai duality]] adjunction at $T$ yields $\mathbf{Def}(T) \simeq \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Ult}}(\mathbf{Mod}(T), \mathbf{Set})$ the category of [[ultrafunctors]] from the category of models (logical functors $\mathbf{Def}(T) \to \mathbf{Set}$) to $\mathbf{Set}$ viewed as [[ultracategories]], so that one may identify a definable set (and definable sets with extra definable structure on them) $X \in \mathbf{Def}(T)$ with a [[functor of points]] $M \mapsto X(M)$ on the category of models.

* The fact that the [[external axiom of choice]] (all epimorphisms split) holds in $\mathbf{Set}$ if and only if every [[fully faithful]] [[essentially surjective]] [[functor]] between [[small]] categories is a true [[equivalence of categories]] can be word-for-word internalized to $\mathbf{Def}(T)$. This means: if the theory has two constants, then $T$ has definable Skolem functions if and only if every fully faithful essentially surjective definable functor between definable categories admits a [[pseudoinverse]].

* With a suitable amount of choice (definable Skolem functions, for example) Freyd's general adjoint functor theorem also carries over word-for-word to the setting of internal categories in $\mathbf{Def}(T)$.

* In particular, there is much studied case of __definable groups__, cf. e.g. ([Peterzil-Pillay](#PeterzilPillay))

###### Theorem

There is a [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence between internal imaginary sorts of $T$ and definable concrete groupoids with a single isomorphism class, up to bi-interpretability over $T$ for the internal imaginary sorts and Hrushovski-equivalence for the definable concrete groupoids.
