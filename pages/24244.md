### Abstract ###
[[Homotopy type theory]] is an extension of [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] with principles inspired by category theory and homotopy theory. With these extensions, type theory can be used to construct proofs of homotopy-theoretic theorems, in a way that is very amenable to computer-checked proofs in proof assistants such as Coq and Agda. In this paper, we give a computer-checked construction of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]]. For an abelian group $G$, an EilenbergMacLane space $K(G,n)$ is a space (type) whose $n^{th}$ [[homotopy group]] is $G$, and whose homotopy groups are trivial otherwise. These spaces are a basic tool in algebraic topology; for example, they can be used to build spaces with specified homotopy groups, and to define the notion of [[cohomology]] with coefficients in $G$. Their construction in type theory is an illustrative example, which ties together many of the constructions and methods that have been used in homotopy type theory so far.
