> **Abstract.** [[homotopy type theory|Homotopy type theory]] is an extension of [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] with principles inspired by [[category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]]. With these extensions, type theory can be used to construct [[proofs]] of [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] [[theorems]], in a way that is very amenable to computer-checked proofs in [[proof assistants]] such as [[Coq]] and [[Agda]]. In this paper, we give a computer-checked construction of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]]. For an [[abelian group]] $G$, an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(G,n)$ is a space ([[type]]) whose $n^{th}$ [[homotopy group]] is $G$, and whose homotopy groups are trivial otherwise. These spaces are a basic tool in [[algebraic topology]]; for example, they can be used to build spaces with specified homotopy groups, and to define the notion of [[ordinary cohomology|cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $G$. Their construction in type theory is an illustrative example, which ties together many of the constructions and methods that have been used in homotopy type theory so far.
