## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[compact topological group|compact]] [[Lie group]]. 

A **[[torus]]** in $G$ is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[subgroup]] $T \hookrightarrow G$ wich is [[connected topological space|connected]] (and [[compact topological group|compact]]).

A **maximal torus** is a subgroup which is maximal with these properties.

The [[Lie algebra]] of a maximal torus of $G$ is called a [[Cartan subalgebra]] of the Lie algebra of $G$.
