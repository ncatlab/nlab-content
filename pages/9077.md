## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[compact topological group|compact]] [[Lie group]]. 

A **[[torus]]** in $G$ is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[subgroup]] $T \hookrightarrow G$ which is [[connected topological space|connected]] (and [[compact topological group|compact]]). Note that any compact connected abelian Lie group must be a torus, hence the name.

A **maximal torus** is a subgroup which is maximal with these properties.

The [[Lie algebra]] of a maximal torus of $G$ is called a [[Cartan subalgebra]] of the Lie algebra of $G$.

## Properties
 {#Properties}

Suppose throughout that the [[compact Lie group]] $G$ is [[connected topological space|connected]].

+-- {: .num_prop #CartanTheorem}
###### Proposition

Given a choice of maximal torus $T \hookrightarrow G$, then each element $g \in G$ is [[adjoint action|conjugate]] to an element of its maximal torus, i.e. there exists $h_g \in G$ such that $h_g g h_g^{-1} \in T \hookrightarrow G$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$, by example \ref{InUnitaryGroup},  prop. \ref{CartanTheorem} is the [[spectral theorem]] that unitary matrices may be diagonalized.

###### Corollary

Any two choices of maximal tori are conjugate.

(e.g. [Johansen, corollary 2.7.5](#Johansen))

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Any two elements of a maximal torus $T\hookrightarrow G$ are conjugate in $G$ precisely if they are conjugate via the [[Weyl group]].

(e.g. [Johansen, prop 2.7.13](#Johansen))

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

The [[conjugacy classes]] of $G$ are in bijection to $T/W(G,T)$.

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
Under the assumptions on $G$, the [[exponential map]] $\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$ is [[surjection|surjective]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The [[exponential map]] $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$ is surjective; similarly, if $\mathfrak{h}$ is a [[Cartan subalgebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$, then the exponential map $\mathfrak{g} \to G$ maps $\mathfrak{h}$ homomorphically onto a maximal torus. Also the exponential map $\mathfrak{g} \to G$ preserves conjugation by any element of $G$, i.e., $\exp(g x g^{-1}) = g\exp(x)g^{-1}$. Then surjectivity follows from Proposition \ref{CartanTheorem}.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #InUnitaryGroup}
###### Example

The maximal torus of a [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ is the subgroup $U(1)^n\hookrightarrow U(n)$ of diagonal matrices with unitary entries.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example


The maximal torus of the [[special unitary group]] $SU(n+1)$ is again $U(1)^n$ (one dimension lower) included as the subgroup of diagonal matrices whose first $n$ diagonal entries are arbitrary elements of $U(1)$ and whose last diagonal entry is the inverse of their product.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The maximal torus of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(2n)$ and $SO(2n+1)$ is $U(1)^n \simeq SO(2)^n$ included block-diagonal (with, in the odd-dimensional case, the remaining block entry being the unit).
