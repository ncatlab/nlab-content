
An __entire function__ is a [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[function]] of one complex variable that is defined and [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on the entire (hence the name) [[complex plane]] (as opposed to a [[partial function|partial]] holomorphic function, which might be defined only on some [[open subset]] of the plane). 

The study of entire functions is a rather nontrivial branch of [[complex analysis]]; of course, with many applications.
