# Definition #

A category is **balanced** if every [[monomorphism|monic]] [[epimorphism|epic]] morphism is an [[isomorphism]].

# Remarks #

* The possibility of monic epics that are not isomorphisms does not survive any strengthening of "monic" or "epic."  Any monic [[extremal epimorphism]] is necessarily an isomorphism, and therefore so is any monic [[strong epimorphism]] or [[regular epimorphism]] (and dually).  It follows that if all epics, or all monos, are extremal, then the category is automatically balanced.

* In an "unbalanced" category it is frequently the case that the monomorphisms, the epimorphisms, or both, are not the "right" notion to consider and should be replaced by their [[extremal epimorphism|extremal]], [[strong epimorphism|strong]], or [[regular epimorphism|regular]] counterparts.


# Examples and non-examples #

* Any [[topos]] (in fact, any [[pretopos]]) is balanced.  Of course, this includes [[Set]].

* Some algebraic categories, such as [[Grp|the category of groups]], are balanced.

* Any [[abelian category]] is balanced.

* The category of rings is not balanced; $Z\hookrightarrow Q$ is monic and epic but not an isomorphism.

* Topological categories are rarely balanced; in [[Top]], for example, the monic epics are the continuous bijections.  However, the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is balanced.

* In a [[poset]] or a [[quiver]], _every_ morphism is both monic and epic; thus such categories are "as far as possible from being balanced."

# Discussion #

The following discussion is about the use of "bimorphism" in place of "monic epic."

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I don't like the word "bimorphism."  If I've been thinking about [[bicategory|bicategories]] then it sounds like something that is "a morphism up to isomorphism," while if I've been thinking about [[biproduct|biproducts]] it sounds like something that is "both a morphism and a comorphism."  Are monic epics really an important enough concept to deserve its own word?  Can't we just say "monic and epic" or even just "monic epic"?

_Toby_:  It makes sense to me.  Using 'bi' in bicategories is bad anyway.  But it's much like 'bi' in 'biproduct', although I suppose technically one ought to say 'bimonomorphism'.  You\'re right that they may not be that important; I see them mostly as a way to say give counterexamples to the na√Øve student's guess that all categories are balanced.  But then, are balanced categories an important concept?

_Mike_: Of course, "bi" in bicategories is bad, but because of people who are used to "bi-" meaning "weak" I think it is better to avoid "bi-" altogether whenever possible.  I wouldn't object too strongly to "bimonomorphism."  But "monic epic" is the same number of syllables as "bimorphism," fewer syllables than "bimonomorphism," and its meaning is (to me) more obvious than either.

I don't think that balanced categories are a very important object of study in their own right, but it is sometimes useful to know that a particular category, or a particular type of category (such as a [[pretopos]]), is balanced.

_Toby_: As it doesn\'t matter too much, we can avoid 'bimorphism' here. But surely you realise that it\'s cheating to compare 'monic epic' and 'bimonomorphism'; you can compare the adjectives 'monic epic' and 'bimonic' or compare the nouns 'monic epimorphism' and 'bimonomorphism' (or compare their abbreviations 'monic epi' and 'bimono' if you like those, although I tend not to use those in writing).

_Mike_: Yes, of course you're right for the syllable count.  I still maintain that the _meaning_ of "monic epic" is more obvious than either "bimorphism" or "bimonic," which is the more important thing, especially for a little-used concept.
