For any (commutative) ring $k$, a $k$-**plethory** is a [[monoid object]] in the [[monoidal category]] of $k$-$k$-[[biring|birings]], with respect to the composition product. That is, it is a biring $P$ equipped with an associative map of birings $\circ: P \odot_k P \to P$ and unit $k \langle e \rangle \to P$.

In other words, 

>a $k$-plethory is a commutative k-algebra together with a comonad structure on the covariant functor it represents, much as a k-algebra is the same as a $k$-module that represents a comonad. So, just as a $k$-algebra is exactly the structure that knows how to act on a $k$-module, a $k$-plethory is the structure that knows how to act on a commutative $k$-algebra. ([BW05](#BW05))

The most famous example of such an object is $\Lambda$, the ring of [[symmetric polynomials]] in countably many variables, which is a $\mathbb{Z}$-plethory.
