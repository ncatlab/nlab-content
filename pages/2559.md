## Definition#

[[William Lawvere]]'s definition of an _atomic_ [[infinitesimal space]] is as an [[object]] $\Delta$ in a [[topos]] $\mathcal{T}$ such that the [[inner hom]] [[functor]] $(-)^\Delta : \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{T}$ has a [[right adjoint]] (is an [[atomic object]]).

Notice that by definition of [[inner hom]], $(-)^\Delta$ always has a [[left adjoint]]. A [[right adjoint]] can only exist for very particular objects. Therefore the term **amazing right adjoint**

## Right adjoints to representable exponentials 

Assume $\mathcal{T} = Sh(C)$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], that the [[Grothendieck topology]] on the [[site]] $C$ is [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]]. Let $\Delta \in C \hookrightarrow Sh(C)$ be a [[representable functor|representable object]]. 

Then $(-)^\Delta$ has a [[right adjoint]], hence $\Delta$ is an atomic [[infinitesimal space]],  precisely if it preserves [[colimit]]s.

This is a special case of the general [[adjoint functor theorem]].

For if $(-)^\Delta$ preserves colimits, its [[right adjoint]] is

$$
 (-)_\Delta : (Y \in Sh(C)) \mapsto (U \mapsto Sh_C(U^\Delta, Y))
  \,.
$$ 

The $Y_\Delta$ defined this way is indeed a sheaf, due to the assumption that $(-)^\Delta$ preserves colimits. So this is indeed a [[right adjoint]].

## Related concepts

A [[topos]] $\mathcal{X}$ is a [[local topos]] (over [[Set]]) if its [[global section]] functro $\Gamma = Hom(\ast_{\mathcal{X}}, -)$ admits a [[right adjoint]]. This is hence an "external" version of the amazing right adjoint, exhibitn $\ast_{\mathcal{X}}$ as "atomic".
