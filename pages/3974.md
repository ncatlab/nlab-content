## Idea

A **concrete site** is a [[site]] whose objects can be thought of as [[set]]s with extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]]: it is a [[category]] that is a [[concrete category]] and a [[site]] in a compatible way.

In a [[category of presheaves]] on a concrete site one can consider [[concrete presheaves]].


## Definition

###### Definition

A **[[concrete site]]** is a [[site]] $C$ with a [[terminal object]] $*$ such that

1. the functor $Hom_C(*,-) : C \to Set$ is a [[faithful functor]];

1. for every [[coverage|covering family]] $\{f_i : U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ the morphism 

   $$
     \coprod_i Hom_C(*,f) : \coprod_i Hom_C(*, U_i) \to Hom_C(*, U) 
   $$

   is [[surjective]].

## Examples

* [[CartSp]] (covering families are open covers);

* The [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ (discrete coverage).
