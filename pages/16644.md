For $k$ a [[natural number]] and $x$ an element of a (unital) [[ring]], the **falling factorial** $(x)_k$ (also sometimes written $x^{\underline{k}}$) is defined by

$$(x)_k = x(x-1)\ldots (x-k+1).$$ 

If $X$ and $Y$ are two [[finite sets]] of [[cardinalities]] $|X| = k$ and $|Y| = n$, then the falling factorial $(n)_k$ counts the number of [[injections]] from $X$ to $Y$. Dividing by the action of the permutation group of $X$ with $k!$ elements and counting the orbits, the expression $\frac{(n)_k}{k!} = \binom{n}{k}$ counts the number of subsets of $Y$ of cardinality $k$. 



## Properties 

In the calculus of finite differences, where an analogy is set up between the ordinary "continuous" derivative $(D f)(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ and the "discrete" derivative (= difference operator) 

$$(\Delta f)(x) \coloneqq f(x+1) - f(x),$$ 

it is the falling factorial $(x)_k$ that plays a role analogous to the ordinary power $x^k$. For example, we have $\Delta (x)_k = k (x)_{k-1}$. Compare the formula $\Delta \frac{(x)_k}{k!} = \frac{(x)_{k-1}}{(k-1)!}$ which interpolates the Pascal triangle recurrence 

$$\binom{n+1}{k} - \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k}.$$ 

The discrete analogue of the identity $x^k x^l = x^{k+l}$ is the identity 

$$(x)_k (x-k)_l = (x)_{k+l}.$$ 

This may be used to motivate the definition of $(x)_k$ for all [[integers]] $k$. For $k$ a natural number, define 

$$(x)_{-k} \coloneqq \frac1{(x+k)_k} = \frac1{(x+k)(x+k-1) \ldots (x+1)}.$$ 

Then the difference formula $\Delta (x)_k = k (x)_{k-1}$ and the multiplicative identity $(x)_k (x-k)_l = (x)_{k+l}$ continue to hold for all integers $k, l$. These facts have numerous applications throughout discrete mathematics.
