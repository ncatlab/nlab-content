For $k$ a [[natural number]] and $x$ an element of a (unital) [[ring]], the **falling factorial** $(x)_k$ (also sometimes written $x^{\underline{k}}$) is defined by

$$(x)_k = x(x-1)\ldots (x-k+1).$$ 

If $X$ and $Y$ are two [[finite sets]] of [[cardinalities]] $|X| = k$ and $|Y| = n$, then the falling factorial $(n)_k$ counts the number of [[injections]] from $X$ to $Y$.
