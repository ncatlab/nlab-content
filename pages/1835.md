#Idea#

A _scheme_ is a [[space]] that _locally_ looks like a particularly simple [[ringed space]]: an [[affine scheme]].
This can be formalised either within the category of [[locally ringed spaces]] or within the category of presheaves of sets on the category of affine schemes $Aff$.

The notion of scheme originated in [[algebraic geometry]] where it is, since [[Grothendieck]]'s revolution of that subject, a central notion. 

However, the idea that

A scheme is a ringed space that is locally isomorphic to an affine space.

is much more general and need not be restricted to the locality in Zariski topology and to a notion of affine spaces that are [[duality|formal duals]] of rings. If one takes another subcanonical Grothendieck topology $\tau$ on $Aff$ then one talks about __$\tau$-locally affine spaces__. More generally one can take another "category of local models" $Loc$ replacing $Aff$ and suitable topology and consider sheaves on it, as locally affine space in this generalized sense. The category $Loc$ can sometimes be represented by ringed spaces of special type and the gluing can be sometimes made in a genuine (classical, not Grothendieck) topology, within the category of ringed spaces. 

For instance a smooth [[manifold]] is a ringed space locally isomorphic to a "smooth affine space" $\mathbb{R}^n$, with its standard smooth structure.

The standard concept of scheme in [[algebraic geometry]] is therefore usefully understood as a special case of [[generalized scheme]]s that naturally appear for instance also in [[differential geometry]], in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and many other topics.


# Definition #

## As locally ringed spaces ##

A __scheme__ is a [[locally ringed space]] $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ with an open cover (as locally ringed spaces), by [[affine scheme]]s: the spectra $Spec A = (|Spec A|, \mathcal{O}_{Spec A})$ of unital commutative [[ring]]s.

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of schemes is a morphism of the underlying [[ringed space]]s, such that for each point $x \in X$ the induced map of [[local ring]]s

$$
  (\mathcal{O}_Y)_{f(x)} \to  (\mathcal{O}_X)_x
$$

is _local_ (in that it carries the maximal ideal to the maximal ideal). See [[functor of points]].

+--{.query}
Zoran: This is superfluous: the definition of morphisms in the category of LOCALLY ringed spaces already asks for this condition, one does not need to introduce that as late as when introducing schemes.

[[Jacob Lurie]] argues that underlying locale point of view is better than underlying topological space point of view, see [[schemes as locally affine structured (∞,1)-toposes]].


## Functor of points approach: as sheaves on $CRing^{op}$ ##

The __fundamental theorem on morphisms of schemes__ asserts that there is a [[fully faithful functor]] from the category of schemes to the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on $Aff = CRing^{op}$ 
which sends $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ to the functor

$$
 h_X|_{Aff} : A \mapsto Hom_{Schemes}(Spec A , (X, \mathcal{O}_X))
  \,.
$$

This identifies schemes with those presheaves on [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ that

1. are [[sheaf|sheaves]] with respect to the Zariski [[Grothendieck topology]] on $CRing^{op}$;
2. have a [[cover]] by Zariski-open immersions of [[affine scheme]]s in the category of presheaves over $Aff$.

The standard reference for the functor-of-points approach to schemes is Demazure-Gabriel. 

#Generalizations#

In [[algebraic geometry]] this is a basic object of study, since the revolution of [[Grothendieck]]. There are generalizations like [[relative schemes]] (which are just objects in a [[slice category]] $Sch/S$), relative [[noncommutative scheme]]s in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] introduced by A. Rosenberg in terms of categories and covers defined using pairs of [[adjoint functors]], the generalized schemes of [[Nikolai Durov]], the [[algebraic stack]]s of [[Deligne-Mumford stack|Deligne-Mumford]] and Artin, the dg-schemes of Kapranov, the [[derived scheme]]s of [[Jacob Lurie]], the higher [[algebraic stack]]s of [[Bertrand Toen|Toën]]--Vezzosi, almost schemes (Ofer Gabber and Lorenzo Ramero), formal schemes (Cartier--Grothendieck), [[locally affine spaces]] in the fpqc, fppf or étale topology (Grothendieck), [[algebraic spaces]], etc.
