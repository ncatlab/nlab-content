A __scheme__ is a locally [[ringed space]] locally isomorphic in the Zariski topology to the affine spectrum of a unital commutative [[ring]]. In [[algebraic geometry]] this is a basic object of study, since the revolution of [[Grothendieck]]. There are generalizations like __relative schemes__ (which are just objects in a [[slice category]] $Scheme/S$), relative schemes in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] introduced by A. Rosenberg in terms of categories and covers defined using pairs of [[adjoint functors]], the generalized schemes of [[Nikolai Durov]], the [[algebraic stack]]s of Deligne--Mumford and Artin, the dg-schemes of Kapranov, the derived schemes of [[Jacob Lurie]], the higher algebraic stacks of Toën--Vezzosi, almost schemes (Ofer Gabber and Lorenzo Ramero), formal schemes (Cartier--Grothendieck), [[locally affine spaces]] in the fpqc, fppf or étale topology (Grothendieck), [[algebraic spaces]], etc.
