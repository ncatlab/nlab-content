This page describes some nice properties of the [[category]] $R Cocomm Coalg$ of [[cocommutative coalgebra|cocommutative]] [[coalgebras]] over a [[ground ring]] $R$, in particular details of the proof that it is a [[complete category|complete]], [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], [[lextensive category|lextensive]], [[cartesian closed category]] with a [[generating set]].

_Todd_: I have a question I hope someone can answer: is 
the category of cocommutative coalgebras (let's say over a 
field $k$) locally finitely presentable? 

I can say that every object is a filtered colimit (in fact 
a union) of _finite-dimensional_ subcoalgebras $C$, and it's tantalizing for me to suppose that for such $C$ the functor $hom(C, -): cCoalg \to Set$ preserves filtered colimits, although I don't have a complete proof of that. On the other hand, I can't find any mention of this purported fact anywhere in the literature, and it looks hard just to write down a finite limit sketch for which $cCoalg$ is the category of models. I should probably mention that I am fairly ignorant of accessible category theory, in case it's not already obvious. All help is appreciated.
