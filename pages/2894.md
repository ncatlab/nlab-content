This page describes some nice properties of the [[category]] $R Cocomm Coalg$ of [[cocommutative coalgebra|cocommutative]] [[coalgebras]] over a [[ground ring]] $R$, in particular details of the proof that it is a [[complete category|complete]], [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], [[lextensive category|lextensive]], [[cartesian closed category]] with a [[generating set]].
