## Idea

Many notions *[[internalization|internal]]* to a [[category]] $C$ (e.g.. [[internal groups]]) may be described alternatively in terms of [[functors]] ([[presheaves]], [[pseudofunctors]] etc.) with [[domain]] $C$, [[fibrations]] over $C$, and so on.  The process of replacing the internal structures on object or families of objects in $C$ by such "external"
structures involving the whole category $C$ is called the **externalization**. Sometimes external definitions give large versions (in the sense of set-theoretic size) of some internal notions. 

For example, an [[internal groupoid]] (or even an [[internal category]]) $G$ in a [[finitely complete category]] $C$ gives rise to a [[Grothendieck fibration]]. A Grothendieck fibration equivalent to the externalization of an [[internal category]] is called [[small fibration]].
