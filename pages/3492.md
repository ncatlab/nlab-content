Many notions internal to a category $C$ (e.g. internal groups) may be described instead in terms of functors (presheaves, pseudofunctors etc.) with domain $C$, fibrations over $C$ and so on.  The process of replacing the internal structures on object or families of objects in $C$ by such "external"
structures involving the whole category $C$ is called the externalization. Sometimes external definitions give large versions (in the sense of set-theoretic size) of some internal notions. 

For example, a groupoid (or even a category) $G$ internal to a finitely complete category $C$ gives rise to a so-called *small fibration*.
