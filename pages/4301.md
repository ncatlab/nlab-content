## Definition

### In rings and algebras

For $A$ a [[ring]] or [[associative algebra]], the **commutator** of two elements $x,y \in A$ is the element

$$
  [x,y] := x y - y x
  \,.
$$

### In groups

For $G$ a [[group]], the **group commutator** of two elements $a,b \in G$ is the element

$$
  [a,b] := a^{-1} b^{-1} a b
  \,.
$$

## Properties

* For $A$ an [[associative algebra]], the underlying [[vector space]] of $A$ equipped with the commutator bracket is a [[Lie algebra]] $(A,[-,-])$.
