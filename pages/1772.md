## Idea

When regarding a [[sheaf]] as a [[space]] defined by how it is probed by test spaces, a _concrete sheaf_ is a generalized space that has (at least) an _underlying [[set]] of points_ out of which it is built.

So a concrete sheaf models a [[space]] that is given by a set of points and a choice of which morphisms of [[set]]s from concrete test spaces into it count as "structure preserving" (e.g. count as smooth, when the sheaf models a [[smooth space]]).

More in the intrinsic language of [[sheaves]], a _concrete sheaf_ is a [[sheaf]] on a [[concrete site]] $C$ that, while perhaps not [[representable functor|representable]], is "quasi-representable" in that it is a [[subobject]] of a sheaf of the form

$$
  U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(|U|, S)
$$

where $S$ is a [[set]] and $|U|$ is the [[set]] $|U| := Hom_C({*}, U)$ of points underlying the object $U$ in the [[concrete site]] $C$.

###### Definition

A **[[concrete site]]** is a [[site]] $C$ with a [[terminal object]] $*$ such that

1. the functor $Hom_C(*,-) : C \to Set$ is a [[faithful functor]];

1. for every [[coverage|covering family]] $\{f_i : U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ the morphism 

   $$
      \coprod_i Hom_C(*,f) : \coprod_i Hom_C(*, U_i) \to Hom_C(*, U) 
   $$

   is [[surjective]].

=--

For $F \in PSh(C)$ any [[presheaf]], write

$$
  \tilde F_U : F(U) \to Hom_{Set}(Hom_C(*,U), F(*)) 
$$

for the [[adjunct]] of the restriction map

$$
  F(U) \times Hom_C(*,U) \to F(*)
  \,,
$$

which in turn is the adjunct of the component map of the functor

$$
  F_{*,U} . Hom_C(*,U) \to Hom_{Set}(F(U), F(*))
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A [[presheaf]] $F : C^{op} \to Set$ on a [[concrete site]] is a **concrete presheaf** if for each $U \in C$ the map $\tilde F_U : F(U) \to Hom_{Set}(Hom_C(*,U), F(*))$ is [[injective]].

=--

So a concrete presheaf $F$ is a [[subobject]] of the presheaf $U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(Hom_C(*,U), F(*))$.

Write $ConPSh(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C)$ for the [[full subcategory]] on concrete presheaves.

## Properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The category of concrete presheaves $ConPSh(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C)$ is a [[reflective subcategory]] of the [[category of presheaves]].

The [[left adjoint]] functor $conc$ -- **concretization** --

$$
  ConPSh(C) \stackrel{\overset{conc}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow} PSh(C)
$$

sends a presheaf $F$ to the [[image]] sheaf

$$
  conc F : U \mapsto Im(\tilde F_U : F(U) \to Hom_{Set}(Hom_C(*,U), F(*)))
  \,.
$$

=--



Recall that the [[category of sheaves]] $Sh(C)$ on $C$ is a [[topos]] (a [[Grothendieck topos]]).


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition


The [[full subcategory]]

$$
  ConSh(C) \hookrightarrow Sh(C)
$$

on concrete sheaves is a [[quasitopos]].

## Examples

* The concrete sheaves on the [[concrete site]] [[CartSp]] are the [[diffeological space]]s.
