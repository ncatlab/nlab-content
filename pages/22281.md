## Idea

In discussion of [[topological G-spaces]] (such as in [[equivariant homotopy theory]] and/or [[equivariant differential topology]]) by an _orbit type_ one means the [[isomorphism class]] of [[orbits]] of the [[equivariance group]].

Since every [[orbit]] of a [[group]] $G$ (typically taken to be a [[topological group]]) is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], as a [[topological G-space]], to a [[coset space]] $G/H$, and since these coset spaces, in turn, are isomorphic to each other precisely if the [[subgroups]] $H$ are [[conjugate subgroup|conjugate]] to each other (see also at _[[orbit category]]_), the $G$-orbit types are often identified with the [[conjugacy classes]] $(H)$ of the [[subgroups]] of $G$.
