## Idea

In [[perturbation theory]] in [[quantum field theory]], the edges in a the [[Feynman diagram]] are traditionally thought of as indicating [[particle]] [[trajectories]] of the [[field (physics)|fields]] of the given [[theory (physics)|theory]]. However, this interpretation has its limits, not the least because these "particles" need not satisfy their [[equations of motion]]. To indicate this one speaks of **virtual particles**.
