## Definition

### Of submanifolds

In [[differential geometry]] a __conormal bundle__ of an embedded submanifold is the (fiberwise linear) dual of the [[normal bundle]]. 

### Of locally ringed subspaces

The phrase conormal bundle is also used for more general [[conormal sheaf]] in the study of locally ringed spaces, especially of analytic spaces and [[algebraic schemes]]. 

### Of abelian subcategories

Even more generally, [[Alexander Rosenberg]] defines a conormal bundle of a [[topologizing subcategory]] $S$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ as follows. He first generalizes the notion of the [[defining sheaf of ideals]] to topologizing subcategories as the endofunctor $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{I}_S\in End(A)$ which is the subfunctor of identity $Id_A$ assigning to any $M\in A$ the intersection of kernels $Ker(f)$ of all morphisms $f: M\to N$ where $N\in Ob(S)$. Then the conormal bundle is simply $\Omega_S = \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$, as in the sheaf case.
