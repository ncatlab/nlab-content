## Definition

### Of submanifolds

In [[differential geometry]] a __conormal bundle__ of an 
[[embedding|embedded]] submanifold is the (fiberwise linear) dual of the [[normal bundle]]. 

### Of locally ringed subspaces

The phrase conormal bundle is also used for more general [[conormal sheaf]] in the study of [[locally ringed spaces]], especially of [[analytic space]]s and [[algebraic schemes]]. 

### Of abelian subcategories

Even more generally, [[Alexander Rosenberg]] defines a conormal bundle of a [[topologizing subcategory]] $S$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ as follows. 

He first modifies the notion of the [[defining sheaf of ideals]] of a closed subscheme to the notion of [[defining ideal of a topologizing subcategory]] as the endofunctor $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{I}_S\in End(A)$ which is the subfunctor of identity $Id_A$ assigning to any $M\in A$ the intersection of kernels $Ker(f)$ of all morphisms $f: M\to N$ where $N\in Ob(S)$. One can show that if $T\subset S$ is an inclusion of topologizing subcategories, then $\mathcal{I}_{S}\subset \mathcal{I}_{T}$. In particular, for [[Gabriel multiplication]] of topologizing subcategories we have $\mathcal{I}_{S\circ S} \subset \mathcal{I}_S$.

Then the conormal bundle is simply $\Omega_S = \mathcal{I}_S/\mathcal{I}_{S\circ S}$, similarly to the sheaf case.
