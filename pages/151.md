## Idea

Instances of "dualities" relating two different, maybe opposing, but to some extent equivalent concepts or phenomena are ubiquitous in [[mathematics]] (and in [[mathematical physics]], see at _[[dualities in physics]]_). 

In terms of general abstract concepts in [[category theory]] instances of dualities might be (and have been) organized as follows:

1. **involution** -- any [[automorphism]] which is an [[involution]], hence which squares to the [[identity]] may be though of as exhibiting two dual perspectives on the objects that it acts on;

   * **abstract duality** --  the operation of sending a [[category]] to its [[opposite category]] is such an involution on [[Cat]] itself (and in fact this is the only non-trivial automorphism of [[Cat]], see [here](%28infinity%2Cn%29Cat#automorphisms)). This has been called _abstract duality_. While the construction is a priori tautologous, any given [[opposite category]] often is equivalent to a [[category]] known by other means, which makes abstract duality interesting.

   * **concrete duality** -- given a [[closed category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and any [[object]] $D$ of it, then the operation $[-,D] : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^{op}$ obtained by forming the [[internal hom]] into $D$ sends each object to something like a $D$-dual object. This is particularly so if $D$ is indeed a [[dualizing object in a closed category]] in that applying this operation twice yields an [[equivalence of categories]] $[[-,D],D] : \mathcal{C} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathcal{C}$ (so that $[-,D]$ is a (contravariant) [[involution]] on $\mathcal{C}$). If $\mathcal{C}$ is in addition a [[closed monoidal category]] then under some conditions on $D$ (but not in general) this kind of concrete dualization coincides with the concept of forming [[dual objects]] in [[monoidal categories]].

   From ([Lawvere-Rosebrugh, chapter 7](#LawvereRosebrugh)):

   > Not every statement will be taken into its formal dual by the process of dualizing with respect to $V$, and indeed a large part of the study of mathematics

   >>space vs. quantity

   > and of logic

   >>theory vs. example

   >may be considered as the detailed study of the extent to which formal duality and concrete duality into a favorite $V$ correspond or fail to correspond. (p. 122)


1. **adjunction** -- another categorical concept of duality is that of [[adjunction]], as in pairs of [[adjoint functors]]. Via the many incarnations of [[universal constructions]] in [[category theory]] this accounts for all dualities that arise as instances as the dual pairs 

   * [[limit]] and [[colimit]]

   * left and right [[Kan extension]]

   * [[end]] and [[coend]]

   * [[dependent sum]] and [[dependent product]]

   * [[existential quantification]] and [[universal quantification]]

   (Given that the saying has it that "Everything in mathematics is a Kan extension", this goes some way in explaining the ubiquity of duality in mathematics.)

   When the adjoint functors are [[monads]] and hence [[modalities]], then adjointness between them has been argued to specifically express the concept of [[duality of opposites]].

   Adjunctions and specifically [[dual adjunctions]] ("[[Galois connections]]") may be thought of as a generalized version of the above abstract duality: every [[dual adjunction]] induces a _maximal dual equivalence_ between [[subcategories]].

## Dualizing objects

Of particular interest are concrete dualities between [[concrete categories]] $C, D$, i.e. categories equipped with faithful functors
$$ f : C \to Set$, $\hat f : D \to Set $$
to [[Set]], which are represented by objects $a \in C$, $\hat a \in D$ with the same underlying set $f(a) = \hat f(\hat a)$. Such objects are known as [[dualizing objects]].
