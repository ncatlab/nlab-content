## Idea

From the point of view of [[category theory]], there are two fundamental kinds of dualities:

* _abstract duality_: formally nothing but the reversal of arrows in a category $C$, i.e. the passage from $C$ to the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$;

* _concrete duality_: the oppositely-oriented image of some diagram under a contravariant [[internal hom]] functor $hom(-,V)$.

(See Chapter 7 of [[Lawvere]] and [[Rosebrugh]]'s [Sets for Mathematics](http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/setsformath/).)

> Not every statement will be taken into its formal dual by the process of dualizing with respect to $V$, and indeed a large part of the study of mathematics

>>space vs. quantity

> and of logic

>>theory vs. example

>may be considered as the detailed study of the extent to which formal duality and concrete duality into a favorite $V$ correspond or fail to correspond. (p. 122)


## Examples
* [[opposite category]]
* [[dual space]], [[dual vector space]]
* the duality between [[space and quantity]]
* [[Poincar√© duality]] for finite dimensional (oriented) closed manifolds
* [[Pontryagin duality]] for commutative ([[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) [[topological group|topological groups]]
* [[Cartier duality]] of a finite flat commutative [[group scheme]]
* [[Serre duality]] on nonsingular projective algebraic varieties which has as a special case the statement of the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]]
* [[Grothendieck duality]], [[coherent duality]] for [[coherentsheave|coherent sheaves]]
* [[Verdier duality]] for abelian categories of sheaves; e.g. for a category of sheaves of abelian groups.
* [[Artin-Verdier duality]] generalizing [[Tate duality]] for constructible sheaves over the spectrum of a ring of [[algebraic number|algebraic numbers]]
* [[Koszul duality]]
* [[Stone duality]]
* [[Eckmann-Hilton duality]]
* [[Spanier-Whitehead duality]]
* [[Tannaka duality]]


## Definition

A _duality_ or _[[dual equivalence]]_ is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between a category $C$ and the abstract dual (i.e. [[opposite category|opposite]]) of a category $D$.


## Remarks

* Often two categories are not related by a dual equivalence, but just by a [[dual adjunction]]: an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] between $C^{op}$ and $C$. But every dual adjunction induces a _maximal dual equivalence_ between subcategories of $C$ and $D$, as described below.


## Dualizing objects

Of particular interest are concrete dualities between [[concrete categories]] $C, D$, i.e. categories equipped with faithful functors
$$ f : C \to Set$, $\hat f : D \to Set $$
to [[Set]], which are represented by objects $a \in C$, $\hat a \in D$ with the same underlying set $f(a) = \hat f(\hat a)$. Such objects are known as [[dualizing object]]s.
