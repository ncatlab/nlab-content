## Idea ##


In [[type theory]], _induction-induction_ is a principle for mutually defining [[types]] of the form

$$
  A \colon Type\,,\;\;\; and \;\;\; B \colon A \to Type
  \,,
$$ 

where both $A$ and $B$ are [[inductive types|defined inductively]], such that the constructors for $A$ can refer to $B$ and vice versa. In addition, the constructor for $B$ can refer to the constructor for $A$. 

Such induction-induction occurs for instance when formalising [[dependent type theory]] in [[type theory]].

## Results ##

Inductive-inductive types are related to [[inductive-recursive types]]. Importantly, inductive-inductive types can be reduced to indexed inductive types.

The consistency of the framework used for the elimination (e.g. in the [[theorem prover]] [[Agda]]) is not so clear, as it allows the definition of a universe containing a code for itself. There is an axiomatisation of the new principle in such a way that the resulting type theory is consistent, as proved by constructing a set-theoretic model; see [Forsberg-Setzer 10](#ForsbergSetzer10).

## Higher inductive inductive types ##

Experiments with higher inductive inductive types are sections 11.3 "Cauchy reals" and section 11.6 "Conway surreals"  of the [HoTT book](#HoTTBook).
