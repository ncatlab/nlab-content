## Idea

In [[boolean]] [[propositional logic]], a _tautology_ is any proposition whose validity is unconditional --- independent of the validity of its propositional variables. Several generalizations are possible. On the one hand, the family of boolean tautolgies is also the family of boolean theorems: a proposition is a boolean tautology iff it has a boolean proof. On the other hand, construing a boolean proposition as a universalized equation in the language of boolean algebras, the boolean propositions are also the (universal, first-order) propositions of the form $P(x_1,...,x_n) = \top$ that are valid in every boolean algebra.

## Definition

A *tautology* of an [[entailment]] $(\rhd)$ is an entailed consequence of the initial [[context]]. That is, $\phi$ is a tautology iff
$$ \{\} \rhd \phi .$$

Hence, $\phi$ is a (semantic) tautology in some first-order language iff it is valid in all models of that language:
$$ \vDash \phi $$
or equivalently, for all models $\mathcal{M}$ of the language,
$$ \mathcal{M} \vDash \phi .$$

Similarly, a (syntactic) tautology in some first-order language is a theorem with no hypotheses:
$$ \vdash \phi .$$
