## Definition

In the [[(2,1)-topos]] [[Grpd]] the pair of classes of morphisms ([[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[full functor]]s, [[faithful functor]]s) forms an [[factorization system in a 2-category]].

## Properties

* This is the special case of the [[n-connected/n-truncated factorization system]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]] for the case that $(n = 0)$ and restricted to [[1-truncated]] [[object]]s.

* For $f : X \to Y$ a functor between groupoids, its factorization is through a groupoid $im_2 f$ which is, up to equivalence, given as follows;
  
  * [[object]]s are those of $X$;

  * a morphism $[\phi] : x_1 \to x_2$ is an equivalence class of morphisms in $X$ where $[\phi] = [\phi']$ if $f(\phi) = f(\phi')$.
