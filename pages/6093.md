###### Definition

For $C$ a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,n)-category|symmetric monoidal (infinity,2)-category]], a **Calabi-Yau object** in $C$ is

* a dualizable object;

* a morphism $\eta : dim(X) : ev_X \circ circoev_X \to Id_x$ in $\Omega_x C$ which is equivariant with respect to the canonical action of the [[circle group]] on $dim(X)$ and which is the [[unit of an adjunction|counit]] for an [[adjunction]] between $ev_X$ and $coev_X$.

This is ([Lurie, def. 4.2.6](#Lurie)). 

## Properties

A version of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] says that symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-functors 

$$
  Z : Bord_2^{nc} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

out of a version of the [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms|(infinity,2)-category of cobordisms]] where all 2-cobordisms have at least one outgoing (ingoing) boundary component, are equivalently given by their value on the point, which is a Calabi-Yau object in $\mathcal{C}$.

This is [Lurie, 4.2.11](#Lurie). 

This is closely related to the description of [[TCFT]]s ([Lurie, theorem 4.2.13](#Lurie)).
