A __Jacobson radical ring__ (or simply __Jacobson ring__) is a commutative (unital) [[ring]] whose every prime ideal is an intersection of the maximal ideals which contain it. 
Equivalently, every radical ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. Equivalently, the [[Zariski topology]] on its [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] is a [[Jacobson topology]].
