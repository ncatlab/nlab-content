Various more or less geometrical concepts are called spaces, to name a few vector spaces, topological spaces, algebraic spaces...If such objects form a category, it is natural to look for the [[subobject]]s and calling them subspaces, though it is also often the case that variants which are not subobjects in categorical sense are allowed. A book example is a submanifold versus more general concept of immersed submanifold (whose image topological subspace is not a manifold in general).

In $n$lab, most often by a space we mean some variant of the concept of a [[topological space]].  

A topology $\tau_Y$ (in the sense of Bourbaki) on a set $Y$ is said to be the topology **induced** by the set inclusion $Y\subset X$, where $(X,\tau_X)$ is a given topological space, if $\tau_Y = \tau_X\cap Y = \{ U\cap Y | U\in\tau_X\}$. The pair $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is then said to be a (topological) **subspace** of $(X,\tau_X)$.

If a continuous map $f:Z\to X$ is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image $f(Z)$ in induced topology on $f(Z)$ the map is sometimes called the *inclusion* of topological spaces (by some schools even a neat but nonstandard pun name *moneomorphism* (not a typo!)); $Z$ is thus isomorphic in $Top$ to a subspace of $X$. 

For Grothendieck topologies, one instead of a subspace has a concept of a [[subsite]].
