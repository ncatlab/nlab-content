## Idea

A **monoidal category** is a [[category]] equipped with some notion of 'tensor product' of its [[objects]].  A good example is the category [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]], where we can take the [[tensor product of vector spaces|traditional tensor product]], not only of vector spaces, but also of [[linear maps]]: given linear maps $f \colon V \to W$ and $f^\prime \colon V^\prime \to W^\prime$, we get a linear map

$$ f \otimes f^\prime \colon V \otimes V^\prime \to W \otimes W^\prime \,.$$

The same category can often be made into a monoidal category in more than one way.  For example the category [[Set]] can be made into a monoidal category with cartesian [[product]] or [[disjoint union]] (i.e. [[coproduct]]) as the 'tensor product'.   We can also make [[Vect]] into a monoidal category with [[direct sum]] as the 'tensor product' --- this may seem perverse, but it's actually very useful.

For any monoidal category $M$, the operation of tensor product is actually a [[functor]]:

\[
  \label{TensorProductFunctor}
  \otimes \colon  M \times M \longrightarrow M
\]

This functor, which we can think of as a kind of 'multiplication', makes $M$ into a [[vertical categorification|vertically categorified]] version of a [[monoid]].  This explains the term 'monoidal category'. 

A monoidal category can also be considered a one-object [[bicategory]]. See there for more details.

### General monoidal categories
 {#DefinitionGeneralMonoidalCategories}

We first give the explicit definition in components (Def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) and then highlight the succinct abstract idea (Def. \ref{AsPseudomonoidsInCat}) underlying this.


\begin{definition}\label{MonoidalCategory}
**(monoidal category)**
\linebreak
A **monoidal category** is a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with 

1. a [[functor]]

   \[
     \label{TheTensorProductFunctor}
      \otimes 
        \;\colon\; 
      \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}  
       \longrightarrow
      \mathcal{C}
   \]

   out of the [[product category]] of $\mathcal{C}$ with itself, called the **[[tensor product]]**, 

1. an [[object]]

   $$ 
     1 \in \mathcal{C} 
   $$

   called the **[[unit object]]** or **[[tensor unit]]**, 

1. a [[natural isomorphism]] 

   $$
     a 
       \;\colon\; 
     ((-)\otimes (-)) \otimes (-)
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-) \otimes ((-)\otimes(-))
   $$

   with components of the form 

   \[
     \label{AssociatorInAMonoidalCategory}
     a_{x,y,z} : (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z) 
   \]

   called the **[[associator]]**, 

1. a [[natural isomorphism]] 

   \[
     \label{LeftUnitorInAMonoidalCategory}
     \lambda 
       \;\colon\; 
     (1 \otimes (-)) 
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-)
   \]

   with components of the form 


   $$
     \lambda_x \colon 1 \otimes x \to x 
   $$

   called the **[[left unitor]]**, and

1. a [[natural isomorphism]]

   $$
     \rho \;\colon\; (-) \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} (-)
   $$

   with components of the form 


   $$  
     \rho_x \colon x \otimes 1 \to x 
   $$

    called the **[[right unitor]]**, 

such that the following two kinds of [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]], for all objects involved:

1. **triangle identity** (not to be confused with the [[triangle identities]] of an [[adjunction]]):

   $$
     \array{
        & (x \otimes 1) \otimes y &\stackrel{a_{x,1,y}}{\longrightarrow} & x \otimes (1 \otimes y)
         \\     
         & {}_{\rho_x \otimes 1_y}\searrow       
         && \swarrow_{1_x \otimes \lambda_y}
         & 
        \\
        &&
        x \otimes y
        &&
     }
   $$


1. {#PentagonIdentity} the **[[pentagon identity]]** (or **pentagon equation**):


   $$
     \array{
       && (w \otimes x) \otimes (y \otimes z)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\alpha_{w \otimes x, y, z}}}\nearrow
        &&
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{\alpha_{w,x,y \otimes z}}}
       \\
       ((w \otimes x ) \otimes y) \otimes z
        && &&
       (w \otimes (x \otimes (y \otimes z)))
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{\alpha_{w,x,y}} \otimes id_z }\downarrow 
        && && 
       \uparrow^{\mathrlap{ id_w \otimes \alpha_{x,y,z} }}
       \\
       (w \otimes (x \otimes y)) \otimes z
         && \underset{\alpha_{w,x \otimes y, z}}{\longrightarrow} &&
       w \otimes ( (x \otimes y) \otimes z )
     }
   $$

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{InViewOfMicrocosmPrinciple}
**(role of the [[microcosm principle]])**
\linebreak
Notice how the very definition of monoidal categories (Def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) invokes the Cartesian product *of* categories, namely in the definition of the tensor product (eq:TheTensorProductFunctor) *in* a category. But the operation of forming [[product categories]] is itself a (Cartesian) monoidal structure one level higher up in the [[higher category theory]] ladder, namely on the ambient [[2-category]] [[Cat]] of categories, which thereby becomes a [[monoidal 2-category]]. 

The ability to define pseudomonoids in any monoidal 2-category is an [example](microcosm+principle#examples) of the so-called [[microcosm principle]], where the definition of ([[higher structure|higher]]) algebraic [[mathematical structure|structures]] uses and requires analogous  algebraic structure present on the ambient higher category.  
\end{remark}

With this understood, there is a succinct abstract definition of monoidal categories:
\begin{definition}\label{AsPseudomonoidsInCat}
**(as pseudomonoids in $Cat$)**
\linebreak
A monoidal category (Def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) is equivalently a [[pseudomonoid]] in the [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[monoidal 2-category]] [[Cat]] of categories.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{MakingTheAmbientStructureMorphismsExplicit}
**(making the ambient structure morphisms explicit)**
\linebreak
The equivalent perspective of Def. \ref{AsPseudomonoidsInCat} makes manifest that there is room to be more pedantic about Def. \ref{MonoidalCategory},
since the ambient [[monoidal 2-category]] $(Cat, \ast, \times)$ has its own [[associator]]

$$
  \alpha
    \;\colon\; 
  (Cat\times Cat) \times Cat
  \xrightarrow{\; \simeq \;} 
  Cat \times (Cat\times Cat)
  \,,
$$ 

which, while evident, is, strictly speaking, non-trivial.

This means that the [[associator]] (eq:AssociatorInAMonoidalCategory)
in a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ is actually of the form

   $$
     a 
       \;\colon\; 
     \alpha_\mathcal{C} \left[ ((-)\otimes (-)) \otimes (-)\right]
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-) \otimes ((-)\otimes(-))
     \,.
   $$

Analogously, the ambient [[monoidal 2-category]] $(Cat, \ast, \times)$ comes with its own [[unitor]]

$$
  \Lambda
  \;\colon\; 
  \ast \times 
  \text{Cat}
  \xrightarrow{\;\simeq\; } 
  \text{Cat}
$$ 

(for $\ast$ denoting the [[terminal category]]), which means that the [[unitor]] (eq:LeftUnitorInAMonoidalCategory) in a monoidal category is actually of the form 

   $$
     \lambda 
       \;\colon\; 
     \Lambda_\mathcal{C}\left[ (1 \otimes (-)) \right]
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-)
     \,.
   $$
\end{remark}


### Other coherence conditions 

The original list of [[coherence law|coherence axioms]] for monoidal categories given by Mac Lane in 1963 was longer than what is shown in Def. \ref{MonoidalCategory} above. But Max Kelly showed they could be whittled down to just the pentagon and triangle identities. We reproduce his arguments here. 

In the proofs below, monoidal product symbols $\otimes$ will be suppressed, to save space. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #kel1} 
###### Lemma 
**([Kelly 64](#Kelly))** 
In a monoidal category, the equation $\lambda_x y = \lambda_{x y} \circ \alpha_{1, x, y}$ holds, i.e., the diagram 

$$\array{
(1 x) y & & \\
 ^\mathllap{\alpha_{1, x, y}} \downarrow & \searrow^\mathrlap{\lambda_x y} & \\
1 (x y) & \underset{\lambda_{x y}}{\to} & x y
}$$ 

commutes. Similarly, the following equation holds: $\rho_{x y} = (x \rho_y) \circ \alpha_{x, y, 1}$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We prove only the first equation; the proof of the second is entirely analogous. Since the functor $1 \otimes -$ is an equivalence (being isomorphic to the identity functor), it suffices to show that the triangle on the right in the diagram below commutes: 

$$
  \array{
    ((1 1)x) y 
      & \stackrel{\alpha_{1, 1, x}y}{\to} & 
    (1(1 x))y 
       & \stackrel{\alpha_{1, 1 x, y}}{\longrightarrow} & 
    1((1 x)y) 
       & \stackrel{1\alpha_{1, x, y}}{\to} & 
    1(1(x y)) 
    \\ 
 &  ^\mathllap{(\rho_1 x)y} \searrow & \downarrow^\mathrlap{(1 \lambda_x)y} & & ^\mathllap{1(\lambda_x y)} \downarrow & ? \swarrow^\mathrlap{1(\lambda_{x y})} & \\ 
 & & (1 x)y & \underset{\alpha_{1, x, y}}{\to} & 1(x y) & & 
}$$ 

where the square in the middle [[commuting square|commutes]] by [[natural transformation|naturality]] of $\alpha$, and the triangle on the left commutes by a unit coherence triangle (tensored by $y$ on the right). Since all the arrows are isomorphisms, it suffices to show that the diagram formed by the perimeter commutes. But this follows from the commutativity of the diagram 

$$\array{
 & & (1(1 x))y & \stackrel{\alpha_{1, 1 x, y}}{\to} & 1((1 x)y) \\
 & ^\mathllap{\alpha_{1, 1, x}y} \nearrow & & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{1\alpha_{1, x, y}} \\ 
((1 1)x)y & \stackrel{\alpha_{1 1, x, y}}{\to} & (1 1)(x y) & \stackrel{\alpha_{1, 1, x y}}{\to} & 1(1(x y)) \\ 
 ^\mathllap{(\rho_1 x)y} \downarrow & & ^\mathllap{\rho_1(x y)} \downarrow & \swarrow^\mathrlap{1 \lambda_{x y}} & \\ 
(1 x)y &\underset{\alpha_{1, x, y}}{\to} & 1(x y) & & 
}$$ 

which uses the pentagon coherence condition, naturality of $\alpha$, and a unit coherence condition.

###### Lemma 
**([Kelly 64](#Kelly))** 
The equation $\lambda_1 = \rho_1 \colon 1 \otimes 1 \to 1$ holds in a monoidal category. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
Since $- \otimes 1$ is an equivalence, it suffices to show $\lambda_1 1=\rho_1 1$. We have $1\lambda_1=\lambda_{11}$ by the naturality equation $\lambda_1 \circ (1\lambda_1) = \lambda_1 \circ \lambda_{11}$. Hence we get

$$\lambda_1 1 = (1 \lambda_1) \circ \alpha_{1, 1, 1} = \rho_1 1$$

where the first equation follows from Lemma \ref{kel1} and the second from the triangle identity.

### Strict monoidal categories 

\begin{definition}\label{StrictMonoidalCategory}
**(strict monoidal category)**
\linebreak
A monoidal category (Def. \ref{MonoidalCategory})
is said to be **strict** if the associator, left unitor and right unitors are all [[identity morphisms]] (up to the ambient structure morphisms, see Rem. \ref{MakingTheAmbientStructureMorphismsExplicit}).  

In this case the [[pentagon identity]] and the [[triangle identities]] hold automatically.
\end{definition}

In analogy to Def. \ref{AsPseudomonoidsInCat} we have:
\begin{definition}
A strict monoidal category (Def. \ref{StrictMonoidalCategory}) is equivalently a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid in]]  the [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[1-category]] [[Cat]] of categories and [[functors]] (i.e. with non non-identity [[natural transformation]] between them).
\end{definition}

Very explicitely, it means that:
\begin{definition} A strict monoidal category (Def. \ref{StrictMonoidalCategory}) is a category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with an object $1 \in \mathcal{C}$ and a bifunctor $\otimes:\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ such that for every objects $A,B,C$ and morphisms $f,g,h$, we have:

* $(A \otimes B) \otimes C = A \otimes (B \otimes C)$
* $1 \otimes A = A$
* $A \otimes 1 = A$
* $(f \otimes g) \otimes h = f \otimes (g \otimes h)$
* $Id_{1} \otimes f = f$
* $f \otimes Id_{1} = f$

\end{definition}

### The 2-category of monoidal categories

There is a [[strict 2-category]] MonCat with:

* monoidal categories as [[objects]],

* [[monoidal functors]] as [[1-morphisms]], 

* [[monoidal natural transformations]] as [[2-morphisms]].

One version of [[coherence theorem for monoidal categories|Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem]] states that in MonCat, every monoidal category is equivalent to a strict one.  

Every monoidal category is also [[equivalence in a 2-category|equivalent]] In MonCat to a [[skeletal category|skeletal]] monoidal category.   However, not every monoidal category is equivalent in MonCat to a skeletal strict monoidal category.   For example, the category [[FinSet]] with its cartesian product is equivalent in MonCat to a skeletal strict monoidal category, but the category [[Set]] with its cartesian product is not.  For the former fact, see [this remark by Jamie Vicary](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/10/classical_vs_quantum_computati_2.html#c015959); for the latter, see the end of Section VII.1 in the second edition of *Categories for the Working Mathematician*.

### Closure

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Every small monoidal category $C$ embeds as a [[full subcategory]]
$C \hookrightarrow D$ into a [[closed monoidal category]], where
the embedding functor is a strong [[monoidal functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One can take $D = PSh(C)$ be the [[category of presheaves]] on $C$ and 
$j : C \hookrightarrow D$ the [[Yoneda embedding]]. The category of presheaves on $C$ becomes a [[closed monoidal category]] with the [[Day convolution]] tensor product, which for $F,G \in PSh(C)$ is

$$
  F \star G : e \mapsto 
  \int^{c,d \in C}
  F(c) \times G(d) \times Hom_C(e, c \otimes d)
  \,.
$$

If $F$ and $G$ are both in the image of the Yoneda embedding, $F = Hom_C(-,a)$, $G = Hom_C(-,b)$ for $a,b \in C$, then applying the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] to the two [[coend]]s over $c$ and $d$ we get

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     (j(a) \star j(b))(e)
     &
     =
     \int^{c,d \in C}
     Hom_C(c,a) \times Hom_C(d,b)\times Hom_C(e, c \otimes d)
     \\
     & \simeq
     Hom_C(e, a \otimes b)
     \\
     & \simeq
     j(a \otimes b)(e)
     \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

naturally in $e$.

### Relation to multicategories

There is a [[faithful functor]] from monoidal categories to [[multicategories]], given by forming [[representable multicategory|representable multicategories]].

### Internal logic

The [[internal language]] of monoidal categories is a flavor of [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] (non-commutative multiplicative intuitionistic linear type theory). In this logical context the [[string diagrams]] of monoidal categories are called [[proof nets]].

## Where the definition comes from

The definition of monoidal category looks rather complicated at first sight, so it is natural to wonder if there is some magic wand we can wave that makes it appear automatically.  For example, one might wonder if we can define monoidal categories using [[internalization]].  

In fact a *strict* monoidal category is just a [[monoid]] internal to the category [[Cat]].  Unfortunately this definition is circular, since to define a monoid internal to [[Cat]], we need to use the fact that [[Cat]] is a monoidal category!  Furthermore, hardly any of the monoidal categories in nature are strict. 

So, we need to weaken the definition of monoidal category, and this is where the subtleties come in: we need the associator, left unitor, and right unitor to satisfy some 'coherence laws' --- e.g. the pentagon identity.  

But _where do the coherence laws come from?_  

In fact, these are precisely what we need to make any diagram built solely by tensoring, associators, and unitors commute.  This fact is another version of Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem.  Mac Lane proved it in the same paper where he originally defined the concept of monoidal category.

There are indeed 'magic wands' that automatically produce the definition of monoidal category, but most of these magic wands  are so heavy that only more advanced wizards can lift them.  

For example, you can define a monoidal category to be a [[pseudomonoid]] internal to the 2-category [[Cat]] --- but nobody knew how to define these concepts until they knew what a monoidal category is!


Two other closely related approaches involve [[2-monad|2-monad theory]] and [[homotopy theory]].  

To make the first one work, the magic words to say are "there is a 2-monad whose algebras are strict monoidal categories, and a (non-strict) monoidal category is a pseudo-algebra for that 2-monad."  This doesn't give you the definition of monoidal categories that we're used to, though; it gives you the [[bias|unbiased]] version.

To make the second magic wand work, the magic words to say are "there is a monad/operad/etc. in [[Cat]] whose algebras are strict monoidal categories, and the monad/operad/etc. whose algebras are (non-strict) monoidal categories is a cofibrant replacement for that one."  Since cofibrant replacements are usually defined only up to equivalence, this one also doesn't determine the usual definition uniquely.  There is a "canonical" choice, but again it gives you the unbiased version.  The equation "cofibrant = [[flexibility|flexible]]" says that these two magic wands are doing essentially the same thing.

Of course, both are also sort of a cheat, since in order to prove that the biased and unbiased definitions are equivalent, you need to have the [[coherence theorem]] for the biased definition.  However, it's only because of the coherence theorem that we can say definitely that the usual set of complicated-looking diagrams is "correct."  The approach using lax $\infty$-functors really only postpones this question, since you also need a coherence theorem to show that the definition of lax $\infty$-functor is "correct."  So perhaps there is no magic wand after all, at least not one that produces the _specific_ diagrams in the usual biased definition of monoidal category.

However, if we temporarily ignore the unitors and focus on the associator, we may ask _where does the pentagon identity come from?_  And one answer to this is provided by the Stasheff polytopes, which can be nicely obtained using Ross Street's theory of orientals.   For instance the pentagon diagram above is nothing but the [[oriental|4th oriental]]! The tensor product itself is the second oriental, and the associator the third.  The following section explains this in a bit more detail.


## Relation to lax functors, orientals and descent

One can understand the structure of a monoidal category as a special simple case of the general notion of "lax $\infty$-functor", also known -- up to the issue of invertible versus non-invertible structure morphisms -- as the notion of $\infty$-categorical [[descent]] and as the notion of [[anafunctor|infinity-anafunctor]].

The discussion to follow now notably links the definition of monoidal category as above with that of [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category]].

This may be familiar from the special simple case of a _monoid_ in any bicategory $C$, which can be identified with a lax functor 

$$
  A : pt \to C
$$

from the point to $C$. This lax functor sends the point to some object of $C$, sends the [[identity morphism]] on the point to some [[endomorphism]] of that object. The unitor of the lax functor gives the product on that endomorphism and the coherence of the unitor is the associativity condition on this product.

This is part of a more general principle. A lax [[monoid]] in any tricategory would again be a lax functor from the point to that tricategory. 

And a monoidal category can be regarded as a pseudomonoid in the tricategory $\mathbf{B}Cat$, which has a single object, categories as 1-morphisms with the composition of 1-morphisms being the standard cartesian [[tensor product]] on categories.

Evidently, in the fully general context of weak $\infty$-categories it becomes increasingly hard to state what a lax functor into a given $\infty$-category should be: it will involve a plethora of structure morphisms and their coherences. One task of [[higher category theory]] is to organize this mess into something pretty and then to deal with this problem.

But before being intimidated by the problem in its most general form, it may pay to understand it in slightly simplified situations. One such slightly simplified setup is that of _strict_ $\infty$-categories, usually known as $\omega$-categories or [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]].

For that case, Ross Street has given a general combinatorial formula for the $\infty$-coherence law of the general monoidal structure: this is encoded in the [[oriental|orientals]], which are nothing but the standard simplicial simplices, but equipped with extra information about source and targets of all faces.

See the picture of the [[oriental|first five orientals]]. We can read off the above definition of a monoidal category from them as follows:

* identify the monoidal category $M$ itself with the first oriental, just an arrow;

* identify the ambient product $M \times M$ with the juxtaposition of two such arrows;

* identify the tensor product $M \otimes M \to M$ with the second oriental: a triangular cell going from the concatenation of two arrows to a single arrow;

* identify the _associator_ with the third oriental, the tetrahedron: a map from one way to compose three arrows (=copies of $M$) to the other way of doing this;

* identify the pentagon identity with the fourth oriental. In general, the fourth oriental is itself a nontrivial 4-cell, but assume now that the big arrow in the middle of that is the identity. This makes what in general would be the _pentagonator_, the _pentagon identity_ in this case.

This shows that it is a bit of an illusion to think of a _pentagon_ identity: the full geometric shape is really a 4-dimensional tetrahedron (the 4-simplex) whose five tetrahedral faces are the five edges of the pentagon identity.

We can formulate this identification of structure morphisms and coherence laws with orientals more formally using the general notion of [[descent]], which was indeed the original motivation for conceiving the orientals. The descent $\infty$-category $Desc(Y,A)$ (constructed in terms of orientals) can be regarded as a way to formalize "lax $\infty$-functor from $Y$ to $A$".

Indeed, using observations pretty much as just sketched, one finds that for $C$ a 2-category that
$$
  Desc(pt, C) \simeq WeakMonoids(C)
$$
and for $C$ the 3-category $\mathbf{B}Cat$ we have
$$
  Desc(pt, \mathbf{B}Cat) \simeq LaxMonCat
  \,,
$$
where the 2-category on the right is defined as $MonCat$ above, but with the associator not required to be an isomorphism.


## Remark: pseudo versus lax, orientals versus unorientals

In closing, it should be remarked that the fact that everything here is _lax_ instead of _pseudo_ is related to a curious property of the orientals: the $n$th oriental for $n \ge 1$ _fails_ to be weakly equivalent to the point. As a result, the objects of $Desc(pt, C)$ are not quite $\omega$-[[anafunctor]]s from the point to $C$, since they do not map out of a proper hypercover of $C$. In the strict notion of descent as used in most of the literature, the orientals would hence provide something _more general_ than ordinary descent, which in its generality is lacking some properties usually required of descent.

We can remedy this by replacing in the definition of the descent $\infty$-category $Desc(Y,C)$ the orientals by another cosimplicial $\infty$-category, one which _is_ equivalent to the point in each degree. Doing so and then going through the above discussion will make _all_ the structure maps appeaing have inverses. But this will also apply to the monoidal product itself, then, which is usually not desired.
