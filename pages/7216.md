## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]] over a [[field]] $k$, its **dual vector space** $V^*$ is the vector space of [[linear maps]] $V \to k$. 

This is the [[internal hom]] in [[Vect]]

$$
  V^* \coloneqq [V,k]
  \,.
$$


## Properties

The operation $V \mapsto V^*$ extends to a contravariant [[functor]]: given a linear map $A: V\to W$, the dual or __transpose map__ $A^* = A^T : W^*\to V^*$ is given by $\langle A^*(w_1), v\rangle = \langle w_1, A(v)\rangle$ $\forall w_1\in W^*$, $\forall v\in V$.  This is, of course, the [[representable functor]] represented by the field $k$ as a vector space over itself.

For $V$ of finite ($F$-[[F-finite|finite]]) [[dimension]], $V^*$ is its [[dual object]] with respect to the standard [[monoidal category]] structure on [[Vect]].  In this case, we also have $V \cong V^*$, but this [[isomorphism]] is *not* [[natural isomorphism|natural]].  (Indeed, $V \mapsto V^*$ is only a [[contravariant functor]].)  However, we do have a natural isomorphism $V \cong V^{**}$.

More generally, even for infinite-dimensional $V$ we have a [[natural transformation]] $V \to V^{**}$, which is an isomorphism when $V$ has finite dimension.
