## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]] over a [[field]] $k$, its **dual vector space** $V^*$ is the vector space of [[linear maps]] $V \to k$. 

This is the [[internal hom]] in [[Vect]]

$$
  V^* := [V,k]
  \,.
$$

## Properties

For $V$ of finite [[dimension]], $V^*$ is its [[dual object]] with respect to the standard [[monoidal category]] structure on [[Vect]].
