## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]] over a [[field]] $k$, its **dual vector space** $V^*$ is the vector space of [[linear maps]] $V \to k$. 

This is the [[internal hom]] in [[Vect]]

$$
  V^* \coloneqq [V,k]
  \,.
$$


## Properties

For $V$ of finite ($F$-[[F-finite|finite]]) [[dimension]], $V^*$ is its [[dual object]] with respect to the standard [[monoidal category]] structure on [[Vect]].

In this case, we also have $V \cong V^*$, but this [[isomorphism]] is *not* [[natural isomorphism|natural]].  (Indeed, $V \mapsto V^*$ is only a [[contravariant functor]].)  However, we do have a natural isomorphism $V \cong V^{**}$.  More generally, we have a [[natural transformation]] $V \to V^{**}$, which is an isomorphism when $V$ has finite dimension.
