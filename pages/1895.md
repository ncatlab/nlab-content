**Hecke algebra** is a term for a class of [[algebras]].

Typically the term refers to an algebra which is the endomorphisms of a [[permutation representation]] of a [[topological group]], though some liberties have been taken with this definition, and often the term means some modification of such an algebra.

For example:
* If we consider the group $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ acting on the set of [[complete flags]] in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, we obtain an algebra generated by the endomorphism $\sigma_i$ which sends the characteristic function of one flag $\mathbf{F}=\{F_1\subset \cdots \subset F_{n-1}\subset \mathbb{F}_q^n\}$ to the characteristic function of the set of flags $\mathbf{F}'$ with $F_j'=F_j$ for all $j\neq i$ and $F_i'\neq F_i$.  These elements satisfy the relations
$$\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i=\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}$$
$$\sigma_i\sigma_j=\sigma_j\sigma_i \qquad (|i-j|>1)$$
$$\sigma_i^2=(q-1)\sigma+q$$
* If we look at $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q((t)))$ acting on the set of $\mathbb{F}_q[[t]]$ [[lattices]] in $\mathbb{F}_q((t))^n$, then we will obtain the spherical Hecke algebra.
