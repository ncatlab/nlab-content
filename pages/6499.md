## Idea

Global [[analytic geometry]] is a developing subject that gives an alternative/complementary approach to scheme theory in [[arithmetic geometry]] and [[analytic number theory]]. The starting point of this theory is in Vladimir Berkovich's book about spectral theory and non-archimedean analytic geometry. It was then developped further by Jerome Poineau.

## Motivation
 {#Motivation}

Global analytic geometry

* combines [[non-archimedean analytic geometry|non-archimedean]] and archimedean [[analytic geometry]];

* contains [[algebraic geometry]] as a sub-theory;

* treats all places on equal footing, contrary to scheme theory. This implies that it is closer in spirit to the automorphic philosophy and [[Langlands program]], and more historically to Tate's proof of the functional equation.

The main aim of the theory is to define, using global analytic tools, a good [[category]] of analytic motivic coefficients, that would help in proving naturally:

* the functional equation of [[zeta functions]] of arbitrary [[arithmetic varieties]];
* an [[analytic langlands program]], giving a correspondence between general (non-algebraic) [[automorphic representations]] and global [[analytic motives]].

Argument in favor of its use are:

* the fact that archimedean factors are deeply related to (analytic) [[Hodge theory]];

* the fact that all [[proofs]] of parts of [[local Langlands program]] use deeply non-archimedean analytic spaces that are out of the scope of classical algebraic scheme theory.
