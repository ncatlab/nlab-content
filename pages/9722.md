## Idea

The category $sAb$ of [[simplicial abelian groups]]. Equivalently that of [[simplicial objects]] in [[Ab]], and also equivalently that of [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group objects]] in [[sSet]].

## Properties

* By the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], $sAb$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[category of chain complexes]] $Ch_\bullet(Ab)$ (of [[abelian groups]] and in non-negative degree).
