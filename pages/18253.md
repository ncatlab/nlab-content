###### Lemma

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] such that 

1. $X$ is [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]],

1.  every [[open cover]] of $X$ has a [[refinement]] by a [[locally finite closed cover]].

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $X$. We need to find a refinement to a locally finite open cover.

By assumption, there exists a locally finite closed refinement $\phi \colon J \to I$,  $\{C_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$. By definition this means that for each $x \in X$ there is an open neighbourhood $U_x$ which intersects only a finite number of the $C_j$. Choosing such for each $x$ yields an open cover

$$
  \{U_x \subset X\}_{x \in X}
  \,.
$$

Again by assumption, this cover itself has a locally finite closed refinement $\phi \colon H \to X$, $\{C_h \subset X  \}_{h \in H}$. Being a refinement, each $C_h$ still intersects only finitely many of the $C_j$.

Define then

$$
  V_j
   \coloneqq
  X \backslash \left( 
    \underset
       {
         {h \in H}
         \atop
         { C_h \cap C_j = \emptyset}
       }
       {\cup} C_h
  \right)
$$

for each $j \in J$.

Observe that

1. $V_j$ is an open set. 

   To see this, it is sufficient to find for each point $x \in V_j$ an open neighbourhood $V_x \subset V_j$. By the local finiteness of the $C_h$ there exists an open $V_x \subset X$ which intersects only a finite subset of the $C_h$ and among this there is the finite subset $\{C_{h_1}, \cdots, C_{h_n}\}$ of those $C_h$ which do not intersect $C_j$.  Hence $V_x \backslash ( C_{h_1} \cup \cdots \cup C_{h_n} )$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ contained in $V_j$.

1. $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ is a cover of $X$

   because $V_j \subset C_j$ for each $j$ and since $\{C_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ is a cover.

Hence $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ is an open cover of $X$. 

Observe that this cover is locally finite:

(...)

Now by the assumption that $\{C_h \subset X\}_{h \in H}$ is locally finite, there exists an open neighbourhood $U_x$ of $x$ which intersects only finitely many of the $C_h$

1. $X$ is [[regular topological space|regular]];

1. every [[open cover]] of $X$ has a [[refinement]] by a [[locally finite cover]] (not necessarily [[open cover|open]]).

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].

**([[Michael's theorem]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] such that

1. $X$ is [[regular topological space|regular]];

1. every [[open cover]] of $X$ has a refinement by a union of a [[countable set]] of [[locally finite sets of subsets]] (not necessarily open, and not necessarily covering). 

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].
