###### Lemma
**([[Michael's theorem]], [Michael 53, theorem 1](#Michael53))**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] such that

1. $X$ is [[regular topological space|regular]];

1. every [[open cover]] of $X$ has a [[refinement]] by a union of a [[countable set]] of 

   [[locally finite sets of subsets|locally finite]] sets of open subsets (not necessarily covering). 

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].

###### Proposition
**(second-countable regular spaces are paracompact)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[second-countable topological space|second-countable]];

1. [[regular topological space|regular]].

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].

###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover. By [[Michael's theorem]] (lemma \ref{RegularSpacesWherOpenCoveringIsRefinedbyCountableLocallyFiniteConnectionsofOpensAreParacompact}) it is sufficient that we find a [[refinement]] by a [[countable cover]].

By assumption of second-countability, there exists a countable set $\{K_n \subset X\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspaces]]. For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we may regard $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ as a cover of $K_n$, and hence by compactness there exists a finite set $J_n$ such that $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J_n \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $K_n$. Therefore 

$$
  \{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} J_n}
$$

is a countable subcover.
