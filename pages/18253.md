###### Lemma
**([[Michael's theorem]], [Michael 53, theorem 1](#Michael53))**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] such that

1. $X$ is [[regular topological space|regular]];

1. every [[open cover]] of $X$ has a [[refinement]] by a union of a [[countable set]] of [[locally finite sets of subsets|locally finite]] sets of open subsets (not necessarily covering). 

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].

###### Proposition
**(second-countable regular spaces are paracompact)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[second-countable topological space|second-countable]];

1. [[regular topological space|regular]].

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover. By [[Michael's theorem]] (lemma \ref{RegularSpacesWherOpenCoveringIsRefinedbyCountableLocallyFiniteConnectionsofOpensAreParacompact}) it is sufficient that we find a [[refinement]] by a [[countable cover]].

But second countability implies precisely that every open cover has a countable subcover:


Every open cover has a refinement by a cover consisting of [[base for the topology|base]] elements, and if there is only a countable set of these, then the resulting refinement necessarily contains at most this countable set of distinct open subsets.
