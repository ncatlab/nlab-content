## Idea

A _compactum_, or _compact Hausdorff space_, is a [[space]] in which every [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that should exist does exist and does so uniquely.

One can define this literally for [[topological spaces]], or in terms of [[convergence spaces|convergence]], or for [[locales]]; although these are all different contexts, the resulting notion of compactum is (at least assuming the [[axiom of choice]]) always the same.  Interestingly, there is even an algebraic definition, not one that uses only finitary operations, but one which uses a [[monad]]. 


## Definitions

If you know what a [[compact space]] is and what a [[Hausdorff space]] is, then you know what a compact Hausdorff space is, so let\'s be fancy.

Given a [[set]] $S$, let $\beta S$ be the set of [[ultrafilters]] on $S$.  Note that $\beta$ is an [[endofunctor]] on [[Set]]; every [[function]] $f: S \to T$ induces a function $\beta f: \beta S \to \beta T$ using the usual application of functions to [[filters]].  In fact, $\beta$ is a [[monad]]; it comes with a [[natural transformation|natural]] (in $S$) unit $\eta_S: S \to \beta S$, which maps a point $x$ to the [[principal ultrafilter]] that $x$ generates, and multiplication $\mu_S: \beta \beta S \to \beta S$, which maps an ultrafilter $U$ on ultrafilters to the ultrafilter of sets whose principal ultrafilters of ultrafilters belong to $U$.  That is,
*  $ A \in \eta x \;\Leftrightarrow\; x \in A $, so $ \eta x = \{ A \subseteq S \;|\; x \in A \} $;
*  $ A \in \mu U \;\Leftrightarrow\; \{ F \in \beta S \;|\; A \in F \} \in U $.

Then a __compactum__ is simply an [[algebra for a monad|algebra]] for this monad; that is, a set $X$ together with a function $\lim: \beta X \to X$, such that
*  each point $x$ is the limit ($\lim$) of the principal ultrafilter $\eta x$, and
*  given an ultrafilter $U$ on ultrafilters, the limit of $\mu U$ is the limit of $(\beta \lim) U$.

It is then a theorem that this $\lim$ generates a [[convergence space|convergence]] on $S$ that is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[topological space|topological]].  The converse, that every compact Hausdorff topological convergence is of this form, is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]].

Every compact Hausdorff space is [[regular space|regular]] and [[sober space|sober]] and so defines a compact regular locale.  Again, the [[axiom of choice]] gives us a converse: every compact regular locale is spatial and so comes from a compactum.
>Probably this is also equivalent to the ultrafilter principle, but I need to check.

Note that every compact Hausdorff space (topological or localic) is not only regular but also [[normal space|normal]].

## Compacta as algebras 

[Under construction...] 

The category of compact Hausdorff spaces is [[monadic functor|monadic]] over $Set$. In other words, there is a monad $\beta: Set \to Set$ and an equivalence $CH \to Alg(\beta)$ which respects the underlying functors to $Set$ up to isomorphism: 

$$(CH \stackrel{U}{\to} Set) \cong (CH \to Alg(\beta) \stackrel{U}{\to})$$ 

The functor $\beta$ takes a set $S$ to the set of ultrafilters on $S$, which may be identified with Boolean algebra homomorphisms $\phi: 2^S \to 2$. Alternatively, each ultrafilter may be identified with a proper subset $\mathcal{U} = \phi^{-1}(1) \subseteq P(S)$ of the power set of $S$ which is 

* Upward-closed: $A \in \mathcal{U}$ and $A \subseteq B \subseteq S$ implies $B \in \mathcal{U}$; 

* Closed under finite intersections: ($A \in \mathcal{U}$ and $B \in \mathcal{U}) implies $A \cap B \in \mathcal{U}$. 

This construction is functorial: a function $f: S \to T$ evidently induces a function $\beta(f): \beta(S) \to \beta(T)$: 

$$Bool(2^f, 2): Bool(2^S, 2) \to Bool(2^T, 2)$$ 

The unit of the monad $\beta$ takes each $s \in S$ to the Boolean algebra homomorphism $ev_s: 2^S \to 2$. Let $\eta_S$ denote this component of the unit. 

Observe also that for any Boolean algebra $B$, there is a canonical Boolean algebra homomorphism 

$$\varepsilon_B: B \to 2^{Bool(B, 2)}: b \mapsto ev_b$$

The multiplication of the monad $\beta$ is the map 

$$Bool(\varepsilon_{2^S}, 2): Bool(2^{Bool(2^S, 2)}, 2) \to Bool(2^S, 2)$$

Next, if $X$ is compact Hausdorff, $U X$ its underlying set, there is an algebra structure 

$$\xi: \beta(U X) \to U X$$ 

which maps each ultrafilter on $U X$ to the unique point it converges to in $X$. 

(To be continued...)


## In weak foundations

In the absence of the axiom of choice, and especially in [[constructive mathematics]], the best definition of compactum seems to be a compact regular locale.  That is, it is the category of compact regular locales that has all of the nice properties, forming a [[nice category of spaces]], and that has the desired examples, such as the [[unit interval]].  (See the discussion at [[Tychonoff theorem]] for an example of how the category of compact Hausdorff topological spaces might fail to be nice; see [Frank Waaldijk's PhD thesis](http://www.fwaaldijk.nl/foundations%20of%20constructive%20mathematics.pdf) (pdf) for a thorough discussion of what is needed to make the unit interval a compact Hausdorff topological space.)

The monadic definition, in particular, falls quite flat without some form of the axiom of choice; even [[excluded middle]] and [[COSHEP]] are powerless here.  In fact, it is quite consistent to assume that every ultrafilter is principal (a strong denial of the ultrafilter principle), in which case $\beta$ is the [[identity monad]].  Then a compactum would be just a set if that were the definition used.

On the other hand, it is the monadic definition that gives an [[algebraic category]] with a nice relationship to [[Set]].  Without the ultrafilter principle, there is no reason to think that the set-of-points functor from compact regular locales to sets is even [[continuous functor|continuous]].


## Stone--Čech compactification

By general nonsense, every $\beta S$, regarded as a free $\beta$-algebra, is a compactum, and the functor 

$$\beta: Set \to Comp$$ 

is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $Comp \to Set$.  Assuming the ultrafilter principle, this functor extends to a functor $\beta: Top \to Comp$ (identifying a set with its [[discrete space]]) that is left adjoint to the forgetful functor $Comp \to Top$.  This is the __Stone--Čech compactification__ functor (N.B.: for many authors, Stone-Čech compactification refers to the restriction of this functor to [[Tychonoff space]]s $X$, which are precisely those spaces where the unit $X \to \beta X$ is an [[embedding]]). 

A classical construction of the Stone-Čech compactification starts with the unit [[interval]] $I =[0, 1]$ and proceeds to the [[codensity monad]] induced from the functor 

$$\hom(-, I) \colon Top^{op} \to Set.$$ 

The monad is given on objects by $X \mapsto I^{\hom(X, I)}$; this lands in compact Hausdorff spaces. Let $\bar{X}$ be the closure of the [[image]] of the unit $u_X: X \to I^{\hom(X, I)}$; under the ultrafilter principle, $\bar{X}$ is compact Hausdorff. 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
If $X$ is a [[Tychonoff space]], then the unit $u_X: X \to I^{\hom(X, I)}$ is a subspace embedding; in other words, $I$ is a [[cogenerator]] in the category of Tychonoff spaces. (In particular, $u_C$ is an embedding if $C$ is compact Hausdorff, so $I$ is also a [[cogenerator]] in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces.)  
=-- 

The proof is essentially [[Urysohn's lemma]]; see also related discussion at [[Tychonoff space]] and at [[uniform space]] (and note that compact Hausdorff spaces are uniform spaces for a unique uniformity). 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
The natural map $i_X: X \to \bar{X}$ is universal among maps from $X$ to compact Hausdorff spaces, thus giving a left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U: Top \to Comp$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $f: X \to C$ be a map, where $C$ is a compact Hausdorff space. Since $I$ is a cogenerator in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the unit for the codensity monad $M_I$,

$$u_C: C \to I^{\hom(C, I)},$$ 

is a continuous injection (and hence a closed subspace embedding, since $C$ is compact Hausdorff). Let $\hat{f} = M_I(f)$, and consider the pullback square 

$$\array{
\hat{f}^{-1}(C) & \to & I^{\hom(X, I)} \\
\mathllap{\pi} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\hat{f}} \\ 
C & \underset{u_C}{\to} & I^{\hom(C, I)}.
}$$ 

From an evident naturality square for the unit $u$, we have a map $h: X \to \hat{f}^{-1}(C)$, i.e., the map $u_X: X \to I^{\hom(X, I)}$ factors through the closed subspace $\hat{f}^{-1}(C) \hookrightarrow I^{\hom(X, I)}$. Therefore $h$ factors as 

$$X \stackrel{i_X}{\to} \bar{X} \subseteq \hat{f}^{-1}(C)$$ 

and since $\pi \circ h = f$, we conclude that $f$ factors through $i_X$. And moreover, there is at most one $k: \bar{X} \to C$ such that $k \circ i_X = f$, because $i_X$ maps $X$ onto a dense subspace of $\bar{X}$, and dense subspaces are epic in the category of Hausdorff spaces. This completes the proof. 
=-- 


We have a similar Stone-Čech compactification functor $Loc \to Comp$; we do not need the ultrafilter principle here if $Comp$ is defined in terms of locales.

## Category of compacta 

The category $Comp$ of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps is 

* [[exact category|Barr exact]], since $U: Comp \to Set$ is monadic, 

* an [[extensive category]], and 

* a [[total category]] (by monadicity over $Set$), and 

* a cototal category (because it is complete, well-powered, and has a [[cogenerator]] given by the unit interval $I = [0, 1]$). 

From the first two properties, it follows that $Comp$ is a [[pretopos]], meaning that $Comp$ enjoys the same finitary exactness properties that hold in a topos; in particular, first-order intuitionistic logic may be enacted within $Comp$.
