## $L_\infty$-algebras

The notion of [[L-infinity algebra]] is something that naturally arises in [[deformation theory]]
and in [[descent]] problems. 

A [[dg-Lie algebra]] is a [[chain complex]] of [[vector space]]s

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  V^{-1}
  \stackrel{d}{\to}
  V^0
  \stackrel{d}{\to}
  V^1
  \stackrel{d}{\to}
  V^2
  \to
  \cdots
$$

and is equipped with a bracket operation

$$
  [-,-] : V^i \otimes V^j \to V^{i + j}
$$

which is

* bilinear

* graded antisymmetric: $[x,y] = (-1)^{deg(x) deg(y)} [y,x]$

* satisfies the graded Jacobi identity $[x,[y,z]] = [[x,y],z] + (-1)^{deg(x) deg(y)} [y,[x,z]]$.

* is graded Leibnitz: $d[x,y] = [d x,y] + (-1)^{deg(x)} [x, d y]$.

**Note** If $deg(x)$ is odd, then $[x,x]$ need not vanish. (see also [[super Lie algebra]]).

Let $L$ be a [[dg-Lie algebra]], degreewise finite dimensional ("of finite type" in the language of [[rational homotopy theory]]).

We can form its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] (see there for details) of cochains

$$
  CE(L) = (\wedge^\bullet L[1]^*, d)
$$

a [[quasi-free dga]]. 

The underlying graded algebra we may dually think of as functions on some 
space, a **formal graded manifold**.

The total differential 

$$
  \delta = \delta_1 + \delta_2
$$

where the first is $d$ and the second is the bracket $[-,-]^*$ extended as a 
graded derivation.

Being a [[derivation]], dually we may think of this as a [[vector field]]
on our formal smooth manifold. This is sometimes called an [[NQ-supermanifold]].

**Definition**

An [[L-infinity algebra]] (see there) 
of finite type  is the evident generalization of this
inroduced by [[Jim Stasheff]] and [[Tom Lada]] in the early 1990s:

it is a (degreewise finite dimensional) 
free graded-commutative algebra equipped with a differential of degree +1.

Now the differential corresponds to a bunch of $n$-ary brackets. For $n = 1$ this is
the differential on the complex, for $n = 2$ this is the binary bracket from 
above, and then there are higher brackets.


### Morphisms of $L_\infty$-algebras

One can consider two notions of morphisms: strict ones and general ones.

A strict one would be a linear map of the underlying vector spaces that
strictly preserves all the brackets.

A general definitin of morphisms is: in terms of the dual [[dg-algebra]]s
just a morphism of these, going the opposite way. In the dual formulation this 
is due to Lada and Stasheff.

We may also think of this as a morphism of [[NQ-supermanifold]]s.

All this arose in this form probably most vivdly in [[BV-BRST formalism]].

So in components such a morphism $f : L \to K$ of $L_\infty$-algebras 
consists of $n$-ary maps

$$
 f_k : L^{i_1} \otimes \cdots L^{i_k} \to M^{i_1 + \cdots + 1 - k}
$$

(where the shift in the indices is due to the numbering convention here only).

### The homotopical category of $L_\infty$-algebra

We will now describe on the [[category]] of $L_\infty$-algebras the structure of
a [[category of fibrant objects]].

The issue is that the category of $L_\infty$-alghebras as defined above has not
all products and coproducts. 

But we can turn it into a [[category of fibrant objects]].

#### A notion of category of fibrant objects

This is analogous to (in fact an example of the same general fact) 
how [[Kan complex]]es inside all [[simplicial set]]s
are the fibrant objects of the [[model structure on simplicial sets]] but do
not form among themselves a [[model category]] but a 
[[category of fibrant objects]].

See [[Kan complex]] for more...

We now look at the axioms for our category of fibrant objects. It is a slight
variant of those in [[BrownAHT]] described at
[[category of fibrant objects]] and draws bit from work of Dwyer and Kan.

Let $C$ be a [[category]]. The axioms used here are the following.

1. There is a [[subcategory]] $W \subset C$ 
   whose morphisms are called **weak equivalences**, 
   such that this makes $C$ into a 
   [[category with weak equivalences]].

1. There is another [[subcategory]] $F \subset C$, whose morphisms
   are called  **fibrations** (and those that are also 
   in $W$ are called **acyclic fibrations**) , such that

   * it contains all [[isomorphism]]s;

   * the [[pullback]] of a fibration is again a fibration.

   * the pullback of an acyclic fibrations is an acyclic fibration.

1. $C$ has all [[product]]s and in particular a [[terminal object]] $*$.


#### Filtered $L_\infty$-algebras as a Getler-category of fibrant objects {#Filtered}

Write $\mathbb{L}$ for the category of _filtered_ [[L-infinity algebra]]s

Let $L^\bullet$ be a [[graded vector space]]

a decreasing filtrration on it is

$$
  L = F^0 L \supset F^1 L \supset \cdots 
$$

such that $L$ is the [[limit]] over this 

$$
  L \simeq \lim_{\leftarrow} L/F^1 K
$$

i.e. if $(x_i \in F^i L)$ then $\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i$ exists

$$
  [-,- , \dots ]_k
$$

has filtration degree 0 if $k \gt 0$ or filtration degree 1 if $k = 0$.

The differential $d x = [x]_1$ has the property 

Then $gr(d)$ is a  true differential $gr(L)$

Morphisms:

$$
  f_k : L^{\otimes k} \to N
$$

where we take $f_k$ to have filtration degree 0 for $k \gt 0$ and filtration degree 1
for $k = 0$.

So $gr(f_1)$ is a morphism of complexes from $gr(L)$ to $gr(N)$.

**Definition** A morphism $f$ is a **weak equivalence** if $gr(f)$ is a 
[[quasi-isomorphism]] of complexess.

If is a **fibration** if $gr(f_1)$ is surjective. 

**Theorem** This defines the structure of 
a (Getzler-version of a) [[category of fibrant objects]]
as defined above.

Given $C$ be a Getzler-[[category of fibrant objects]].

Define a new Getzler-category of fibrant objects $s C$ as follows:

* The [[object]]s  of $s C$ are [[simplicial object]]s in $C$, subject to 
  a condition stated in the following item.

* As in the [[Reedy model structure]], for $X_\bullet$ a simplicial objects
  let $M_k X_\bullet$ be the corresponding _matching object_ , defined by the 
  [[pullback]] diagram
  
  $$
    \array{
      M_k X_\bullet &\to& (X_{k-1})^{k+1}
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      (X_{k-2})^{\left(k+1 \atop 2\right)}&\to& (M_{k+1} X_\bullet)^{k+1}
    }
    \,.
  $$ 
  
  Here the right vertical morphism is assumed to be a fibration, hence so
  is the left vertical morphism. 
  
  So $M_k X_\bullet$ comes with a map $X_k \to M_k X_\bullet$. We assume that this 
  is a fibration. This allows us to define $M_{k+1} X_\bullet$ and to continue
  the induction.
  
  So this defines a _Reedy fibrant object_ .
  
So the objects of $s C$ are Reedy fibrant objects $X_\bullet$ and morphisms are morphisms
of simplicial objects.

The weak equivalences in $s C$ are taken to be the levelwise weak equivalences.

The fibrations are taken to be the Reedy fibrations, as in the [[Reedy model structure]],
i.e. those morphisms $X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ such that 
$X_k \to Y_k \times_{M_k Y_\bullet} M_k X_\bullet$ is a fibration for all $k$.

So this is just the [[full subcategory]] of the [[Reedy model structure]] on 
$[\Delta^{}op], C$ on the fibrant objects.

There is still a fourth axiom for Getzler-cats of fibrant objects to be stated, which 
is the existence of [[path space object]]s. We take this to be gven by a 
**path space functor**

$$
  P : C \to s C
$$

which is such that 

1. for all $X$ the face meaps of $(P X)_\bullet$ are weak 
equivalences;

1. $P$ preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations;

1. $(P X)_0$ is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to $X$.

**Examples** 

If $C$ is the category of [[Kan complex]]es, then $P_k X = sSet(\Delta[k],X)$.

**Proposition**

For our category $\mathcal{L}$ of filtered $L_\infty$-algebras we may set

$$
  P_k L = L \otimes_{compl} \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k)
   =
   \lim_{\leftarrow} L \otimes \Omega / F^i L \otimes \Omega
   \,.
$$


**Remark**

We may also speak of cofibrant objects in a (Getzler-) [[category of fibrant objects]]:

those objects $X$ such that for all acyclic fibrations $f : A \to B$ the induced
map $C(X,A) \to C(X,B)$ is surjective (i.e. those with [[left lifting property]]
again acyclic fibrations).

#### Maurer-Cartan elements

All the above is designed to make the following come out right.

Generally, $C(*,X)$ is the set of points ([[global element]]s) of $X$.


A morphism from the terminal object into an $L_\infty$-algebra is a [[Maurer-Cartan element]]
in the $L_\infty$-algebra. 

Such a point is just an element of degree 1 and filtration degree 1 that satisfies the equation

$$
  \sum_{k= 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}
   [\omega, \cdots, \omega]_k = 0
   \,.
$$

In the case of [[dg-Lie algebra]]s this is just the familiar Maurer-Cartan equation
$$
  d \omega + \frac{1}{2}[\omega, \omega] = 0
  \,.
$$

We have that $C(*. P_k X)$ is a functor from $C$ to the category of [[Kan complex]]es.

For the category of Kan complexes it is the identity functor.

For filtered $L_\infty$-algebras it gives

$$
  L \mapsto MC_\bullet(L) = MC(L \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^\bullet))
$$

This functor $MC_\bullet$ takes fibrations to fibrations and acyclic fibrations to
acyclic fibrations and weak equivalences to weak equivalences.

Other applications to sheaves of $L_\infty$-algebras

Evaluate on a [[Cech-nerve]] to get a cosimplicial $L_\infty$-algebra

$L^\bullet = (L^0 , L^1, \cdots)$

$L^k = \prod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} L(U_{i_0} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_k})$

$$
  Tot(L^\bullet) = \int_{k \in \Delta} L^k \otimes \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k)
  \,.
$$

If $L$ is a [dg-Lie algebra]], then 

$$
  MC_1(L)
  =
  \left\{
     \omega_0 + \omega_1 d t
     |
     \omega_1 \in F^1 L^1 [t], \omega_1 \in F^1 L^0 [t]
     , 
     d_L \omega_0 + [\omega_1, \omega_1] = 0,
     d_{dR} \omega_0 + [\omega_1, \omega_0] = 0
  \right\} 
$$

Now define the **Deligne groupoid** as in Getzler' integration article.

We find inside the large Kan complex of MC-elements a smaller one that is still
equivalent.

$$
  \gamma_1(L)
  \left\{
    \omega \in MC_1(L) | \omega_1 is constant
  \right\}
$$

To get this impose a gauge condition known from homological perturbation theory.

A _context_ is

$$
  L \stackrel{\overset{f}{\to}}{\underset{g}{\leftarrow}}
$$

$$
  g \circ f = Id_L
$$

$$
  f \circ g = Id - (d_M h + h d_M)
$$

$$
  g \circ h = 0, \; h \circ f = 0, \; h \circ h = 0
$$

$$
  MC(L) \simeq \{\omega \in MC(M) | h \omega = 0\}
$$

See Kuranishi's article in Annals to see where the motivation for all this comes from.

**Example** Consider the space of Schouten Lie algebras

$$
  L^k = \Gamma(X, \wedge^{k+1} T X)
$$

Then $MC_(L)$ is the set of [[Poisson manifold|Poisson brackets]] $\mathcal{O}(\hbar)$.

For let $P \in MC(L)$. Then $\pi_1(MC_\bullet(L), P)$ is the 
locally Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms / Hamiltonian diffeos.

$\pi_2(MC_\bullet(L), P)$ is the set of Casimir operators of $P$.

for $k \gt 2$ $\pi_k(MC_\bullet(L), P)$.
