## Definition 

In a [[category]], a **product** (also called a **cartesian product**) of two [[object|objects]] $X$ and $Y$ is an object $X\times Y$ equipped with [[morphism|morphisms]] $p:X\times Y \to X$ and $q:X\times Y \to Y$, called **projections**, such that for any object $Z$ equipped with maps $f:Z\to X$ and $g:Z\to Y$ there exists a unique $h:Z\to X\times Y$ (called the __[[pairing]]__ of $f$ and $g$) such that $p \circ h=f$ and $q \circ h=g$.

Such a categorical product is equivalently a [[limit]] over a [[diagram]] of the shape of the category $\{a,b\}$ with two [[object]]s and no non-trivial morphisms.

More generally, for $S \in $ [[Set]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Cat]] any [[discrete category]], an $S$-indexed limit is a product of $|S|$ factors. If $S$ is a [[finite set]] we speak of a **finite product**. Notice that this includes the case of the [[empty set]], the product over which is, if it exists, the [[terminal object]] of the category in question.

* A product created by the [[forgetful functor]] of a [[concrete category]], especially in algebra, is often called a [[direct product]].


## Properties

* When they exist, products are unique up to unique canonical isomorphism, so we often say "[[generalized the|the]] product."

* One can define in a similar way a product of any family of objects.  A product of the [[empty set|empty]] family is a [[terminal object]].

* A product is a special case of a [[limit]] in which the domain category is [[discrete category|discrete]].

* A product in $C$ is the same as a [[coproduct]] in its [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.


## Examples

* [This interactive demonstration](http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/set_prod_nlab.php) in [[FinSet]] lets you type two sets and see a product, showing the unique map to it from a randomly chosen $Z$ equipped with $f$ and $g$. It also generates a second product, showing the unique canonical isomorphism between this and the first product.
