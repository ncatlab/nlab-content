Term __additive K-theory__ is a synonym for [[cyclic homology]], used in early articles mainly of Russian and a bit by French school. 

__Additive K-theory__ is also a title of a historical article

The additive K-theory is here studied in relation to algebraic K-theory and Hochschild homology. Like there is a K-theory spectrum, one also constructs a additive K-theory/cyclic homology spectrum.
