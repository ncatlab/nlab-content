## Idea

The _BFSS matrix model_ ([Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind 96](#BanksFischlerShenkerSusskind96)) is the description of the [[worldline]] dynamics of interacting  [[D0-branes]]. In the limit of large number $N$ of D0 branes supposed to encode the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strong coupling limit]] of [[type IIA string theory]] (see also at _[[M-theory]]_).

The BFSS matrix model was argued to arise in several equivalent ways: 

1. as the worldvolume theory of a large number of [[D0-branes]] in [[type IIA string theory]], 

1. as the [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of [[10d super Yang-Mills theory]] to zero space dimensions, 

1. as a certain non-commutative regularization  of the [[worldvolume]] theory of the [[M2-brane]] in M-theory ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98), [Dasgupta-Nicolai-Plefka 02](#DasguptaNicolaiPlefka02)). 

In any case, it ends up being a quantum mechanical system whose degrees of freedom are a set of 9+1 large matrices. These play the role of would-be coordinate functions and their eigenvalues may be in interpreted as points in a spacetime thus defined.

In the 90s there was much excitement about the BFSS model, as people hoped it might provide a definition of [[M-theory]]. It is from these times that [[Edward Witten]] changed the original suggestion that "M" is for "magic, mystery and membrane" to the suggestion that it is for "magic, mystery and matrix". (See [Witten's 2014 Kyoto prize speach](M-theory#Witten14), last paragraph). 

There is also the [[IKKT matrix model]], which takes this one step further by reducing one dimension further down (D(-1)-branes). See also at _[[membrane matrix model]]_.
