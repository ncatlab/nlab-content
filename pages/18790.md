## Idea

An *anafunction* is a [[relation]] between two [[sets]] $A,B$ such that to each [[element]] of $A$ there corresponds exactly one element of $B$.  It can (usually) equivalently be defined as a [[span]] $A \leftarrow F \to B$ of functions whose first leg $F\to A$ is both [[injective function|injective]] and [[surjective function|surjective]].

Every [[function]] yields an anafunction, namely its [[graph of a function|graph]], and this embeds the set of functions from $A$ to $B$ into the set of anafunctions.  Conversely, in ordinary mathematics every anafunction is the graph of some function, so these two sets are isomorphic (and indeed, in some foundations such as [[material set theory]], *equal*).  Thus in such cases the notion of anafunction is unneeded.

However, in more exotic contexts where the [[function comprehension|function comprehension principle]] (a.k.a. the "axiom of unique choice") fails, such as the [[internal logic]] of a [[quasitopos]] or a [[tripos]], it may be necessary to distinguish anafunctions from functions.  Indeed, the fact that every anafunction is a function, or equivalently that every injective and surjective function is an [[isomorphism]], is essentially the definition of the function comprehension principle.

Anafunctions are a [[decategorification]] of the notion of [[anafunctor]], and take their name from the latter.  Traditionally they would be called "total functional relations".
