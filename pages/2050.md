###### Theorem
**(Nielsen--Schreier theorem)**

Every [[subgroup]] $H$ of a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[free group]] $G$ is itself a [[free group]]. Moreover, if $G$ is free on $k$ generators and $H$ has index $n$ in $G$, then $H$ is free on $n k - n + 1$ generators.

This has a number of different proofs.

###### Topological Proof (sketch) 
A free group $G = F(S)$ is, by the [[van Kampen theorem]], a [[fundamental group]] of a bouquet[^fine] of $S$ many circles, which is in particular a [[connected space|connected]] 1-dimensional [[CW-complex]] $X$ (in simpler language, a connected graph). By general [[covering space]] theory, given a (pointed) connected space $X$ with $\pi_1(X, x) = G$, subgroups $H \subseteq G$ are in bijective correspondence with isomorphism classes of connected covering spaces $p: (E, e) \to (X, x)$, with $\pi_1(E, e) \cong H$. Now, a covering space $E$ of a connected graph $X$ is also a connected graph. But any connected graph is [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to a bouquet of circles, whose fundamental group is a free group. Thus $\pi_1(E, e)$ is a free group. 

The second statement is proved by observing that the Euler characteristic of $X$ is $\chi(X) = 1 - \rho(G)$, where $\rho(G)$ is the number of generators of the free group $G$, and $\chi(E) = n\chi(X)$ if $p \colon E \to X$ is a covering space with $n$ points in each fiber. 

Full details may be found in [May](#Maybook). Key technical ingredients include: (1) each connected graph $E$ contains a maximal [[tree]] $T$ (using [[Zorn's lemma]]), (2) the quotient map $E \to E/T$ is a homotopy equivalence, and $E/T$ is a bouquet of circles.

This topological proof can be reformulated in more algebraic language, using a little groupoid theory (groupoids being [[homotopy n-type|homotopy 1-types]]). A key construction here is the [[action groupoid]] $X \sslash G$ formed from a $G$-set $X$, also called a homotopy quotient or homotopy orbit space.

###### Groupoidal Proof

By the discussion at _[free groupoid -- fundamental group](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+groupoid#FundamentalGroup)_, we may think of the [[free group]] $F(S)$ as the [[fundamental group]] of a homotopy 1-type which is freely built from a single vertex and one loop from that vertex to itself for each element in $S$. This is the _[[free groupoid]]_ $*\sslash F(S)$ on this [[directed graph]] (a bouquet of circles). It is a classical fact (see at _[[universal principal bundle]]_) that the [[universal cover]] of this is the [[contractible]] groupoid $\mathbf{E}(F(S))$, the [[action groupoid]] $F(S)\sslash F(S)$ of $F(S)$ acting on itself from the right and that its [[quotient]] by the $F(S)$-action from the left recovers the original groupoid with fundamental group $F(S)$. The idea of the following proof is to instead quotient only by the given subgroup $H \hookrightarrow F(S)$ and hence obtain a groupoid with fundamental group $H$. It is then sufficient to observe that this quotient is still a [[free groupoid]] on a directed graph to conclude that $H$ is a free group.

So let $\mathbf{E} F(S) \coloneqq  F(S)\sslash F(S)$ be the action groupoid of $F(S)$ acting on itself (see also at [[universal principal bundle]]). This is [[contractible]], $\mathbf{E}F(S) \simeq *$, and comes with a canonical $F(S)$-[[action]] (from the other side). Hence it comes with an induced $H$-action and the [[quotient]] $H \backslash \mathbf{E}F(S) \simeq H \backslash \backslash *$ is [[generalized the|the]] connected groupoid whose [[fundamental group]] is $\pi_1 = H$. By the properties of [[free groupoids]] discussed at _[free groupoid -- fundamental group](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+groupoid#FundamentalGroup)_ it is sufficient to show that $H \backslash \mathbf{E}F(S)$ is isomorphic to the [[free groupoid]] on a connected [[directed graph]]. But $\mathbf{E}F(S)$ itself is the free groupoid on a directed graph, namely on the _action graph_ $F(S)\sslash S$ (which is the same as the [[Cayley graph]] given by a set $S$ of generators and no relations), and we may consider the quotient graph $H \backslash (F(S) \sslash S)$. The free groupoid functor $F$ preserves this quotient. Thus we have  

$$
  H \backslash \mathbf{E}F\left(S\right) = H  \backslash F\left( F\left(S\right)\sslash S \right) =  F \left(\left(H \backslash F\left(S\right)\right)\sslash S\right)
  \,.
$$
as desired.

###### Remark

The original algebraic proof of theorem \ref{NielsenSchreierTheorem} was rather long and complicated, based on Nielsen's method of short cancellations in [[combinatorial group theory]] based on words (Nielsen's transformations of words, word length functions, ...). The class of _'projective groups'_ ( that is, in this context, [[projective object]]s in [[Grp|the category of groups]]) coincides with the class of free groups. 

The above simple [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] proof was indicated in ([Higgins](#Higgins)), also ([Gilbert-Porter](#GilbrtPorter)).
