###### Theorem
**(Nielsen--Schreier theorem)**

Every [[subgroup]] of a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[free group]] is itself a [[free group]].

###### Proof

By the discussion at _[free groupoid -- fundamental group](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+groupoid#FundamentalGroup)_, we may think of the [[free group]] $F(S)$ as the [[fundamental group]] of a [[homotopy n-type|homotopy 1-type]] which is freely built from a single vertex and one loop from that vertex to itself for each element in $S$. This is the _[[free groupoid]]_ $*\sslash F(S)$ on this [[directed graph]] (sometimes called a "bouquet of circles"). It is a classical fact (see at _[[universal principal bundle]]_) that the [[universal cover]] of this is the [[contractible]] groupoid $\mathbf{E}(F(S))$, the [[action groupoid]] $F(S)\sslash F(S)$ of $F(S)$ acting on itself from the right and that its [[quotient]] by the $F(S)$-action from the left recovers the original groupoid with fundamental group $F(S)$. The idea of the following proof is to instead quotient only by the given subgroup $H \hookrightarrow F(S)$ and hence obtain a groupoid with fundamental group $H$. It is then sufficient to observe that this quotient is still a [[free groupoid]] on a directed graph to conclude that $H$ is a free group.

So let  $\mathbf{E} F(S) \coloneqq  F(S)\sslash F(S)$ be the [[action groupoid]] of $F(S)$ acting on itself (see also at [[universal principal bundle]]). This is [[contractible]], $\mathbf{E}F(S) \simeq *$, and comes with a canonical $F(S)$-[[action]] (from the other side). Hence it comes with an induced $H$-action and the [[quotient]] $H \backslash \backslash\mathbf{E}F(S) \simeq H \backslash \backslash *$ is [[generalized the|the]] connected groupoid whose [[fundamental group]] is $\pi_1 = H$. By the properties of [[free groupoids]] discussed at _[free groupoid -- fundamental group](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+groupoid#FundamentalGroup)_ it is sufficient to show that $H \backslash \backslash\mathbf{E}F(S)$ is isomorphic to the [[free groupoid]] on a connected [[directed graph]]. But $\mathbf{E}F(S)$ itself is the free groupoid on a directed graph, namely on the _action graph_ $F(S)\sslash S$. So 

$$
  H \backslash \backslash \mathbf{E}F\left(S\right) = H  \backslash F\left( F\left(S\right)\sslash S \right) =  F \left(\left(H \backslash F\left(S\right)\right)\sslash S\right)
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

The original algebraic proof of theorem \ref{NielsenSchreierTheorem} was rather long and complicated, based on Nielsen's method of short cancellations in [[combinatorial group theory]] based on words (Nielsen's transformations of words, word length functions, ...). The class of _'projective groups'_ ( that is, in this context, [[projective object]]s in [[Grp|the category of groups]]) coincides with the class of free groups. 

The above simple [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] proof was indicated in ([Higgins](#Higgins)), also ([Gilbert-Porter](#GilbrtPorter)).
