## Idea

The _Giry monad_ ([Giry 80](#Giry80)) is the [[monad]] on a [[category]] of suitable [[spaces]] which sends each suitable space $X$ to the space of suitable [[probability measures]] on $X$.

## Definition

A useful choice of [[category]] of [[topological spaces]] suitable for the definition of the Giry monad is the category, $Pol$, of [[Polish space]]s, i.e., separable [[metric spaces]] for which a complete metric exists. 

Write 

$$
  P \colon Pol \to Pol
$$

for the [[endofunctor]] which sends a space, $X$, to the space of [[probability measures]] on the [[Borel subsets]] of $X$. $P(X)$ is equipped with the weakest [[topology]] which makes the [[integration]] map $\tau \mapsto \int_{X}f d\tau$ [[continuous function|continuous]] for any $f$, a bounded, continuous, real function on $X$. 

There is a [[natural transformation]] 

$$
  \mu_{X}: P(P(X)) \to P(X)
$$

given by

$$
 \mu_X (M)(A) := \int_{P(X)} \tau(A) M(d\tau).
 \,.
$$

This makes the [[endofunctor]] $P$ into a [[monad]], and this is the _Giry monad_.

## Properties

### Algebras over the Giry monad

([Doberkat 03](#Doberkat03)) works out the [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] for the Giry monad. We want measurable maps between $P(X)$ and $X$, such that the 'fibres' are convex and closed, and such that $\delta_{x}$, the delta distribution on $x$, is in the fibre over $x$. And there's another condition which requires a compact subset of $P(X)$ to be sent to a compact subset of $X$.

Now, as ever, $P(X)$ will support an algebra, $\mu_{X}: P(P(X)) \to P(X)$. This is the analogue of a [[free construction|free]] [[group]] being an algebra of the group monad. But just as there are many interesting groups which are not free, we should want to find algebras of Giry's monad which are not of the $\mu_{X}$ form. Doberkat shows that for such an algebra $X$ must be connected, and suggests this example

$$
h: P([0, 1]) \ni \tau \mapsto \int_{0}^{1} t \tau (dt) \in [0, 1].
$$

(One author believe that this might be $\mu_{\{0, 1\}}$. After all, probability measures on $\{0, 1\}$ are just binomial, parameterised by $p \in [0, 1]$.)

The other example he gives has $X$ a bounded, closed and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and probability measures being sent to their barycentre. 

Doberkat has a longer article on [[Eilenberg-Moore algebra]]s of the Giry monad as item 5 [here](http://ls10-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/index.php?id=18). (Unfortunately, the monograph 'Stochastic Relations: Foundations for Markov Transition Systems' doesn't appear to be available.) There are two monads being treated here, one which sends a Polish space to the space of all probability measures, the other to the space of all subprobability measures. The extra structure relating to these monads, is that of a (positive) convex structure. In the case of a convex structure, this intuitively captures the idea that a weighted sum of points in the space has barycentre within the space. 

Doberkat's work relates to the category of Polish spaces with continuous maps. He notes that it would be interesting to develop the theory for the general case of Borel measurable maps.

### Voevodsky's work

[[Vladimir Voevodsky]] has also worked on a category theoretic treatment of [[probability theory]], and gave few talks on this at IHES, Miami, in Moscow etc. Voevodsky had in mind applications in [[mathematical biology]], for example, population genetics: 

See [Miami Talk abstract](http://www.math.miami.edu/anno/voevodsky.htm)

>...a categorical study of probability theory where "categorical" is understood in the sense of category theory. Originally, I developed this approach to probability to get a better understanding of the constructions which I had to deal with in population genetics. Later it evolved into something which seems to be also interesting from a purely mathematical point of view. On the elementary level it gives a category which is useful for the work with probabilistic constructions involving complicated combinations of stochastic processes of different types. On a more advanced level, applying in this context the old idea of a functor as a generalized object one gets a better view of the relationship between probability and the theory of (pre-)ordered topological vector spaces. 

A talk in Moscow (20 Niv 2008, in Russian) can be viewed [here](http://www.mi.ras.ru/index.php?c=obs_sem/&l=1), [wmv 223.6 Mb](http://www.mi.ras.ru/media/335_full.wmv). Abstract:

> In early 60-ies Bill Lawvere defined a category whose objects are measurable spaces and morphisms are Markov kernels. I will try to show how this category allows one to think about many of the notions of probability theory in categorical terms and to connect probabilistic objects to objects of other types through various functors. 

### Panangaden's monad

[[Prakash Panangaden]] in [Probabilistic Relations](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.52.4840) defines the [[category]] $SRel$ (stochastic [[relation]]s) to have as [[object]]s [[set]]s equipped with a $\sigma$[[sigma-field|-field]]. [[morphism|Morphisms]] are conditional probability densities or stochastic kernels. So, a morphism from $( X, \Sigma_X)$ to $( Y, \Sigma_Y)$ is a function $h: X \times \Sigma_Y \to [0, 1]$ such that 

1. $\forall B \in \Sigma_Y . \lambda x \in X . h(x, B)$ is a bounded measurable function,
1. $\forall x \in X . \lambda B \in \Sigma_Y . h(x, B)$ is a subprobability measure on $\Sigma_Y$.

If $k$ is a morphism from $Y$ to $Z$, then $k \cdot h$ from $X$ to $Z$ is defined as $(k \cdot h)(x, C) = \int_Y  k(y, C)h(x, d y)$.

Panangaden's definition differs from Giry's in the second clause where subprobability measures are allowed, rather than ordinary probability measures.

Panangaden emphasises that the mechanism is similar to the way that the category of relations can be constructed from the [[power set]] [[functor]]. Just as the category of relations is the [[Kleisli category]] of the powerset functor over the category of sets [[Set]], $SRel$ is the Kleisli category of the functor over the category of [[measurable space]]s and [[measurable function]]s which sends a measurable space, $X$, to the measurable space of sub[[probability measure]]s on $X$. This functor gives rise to a [[monad]].

What is gained by the move from probability measures to subprobability measures? One motivation seems to be to model probabilistic processes from $X$ to a [[coproduct]] $X + Y$. This you can iterate to form a process which looks to see where in $Y$ you eventually end up. This relates to $SRel$ being traced.

There is a [[monad]] on $MeasureSpaces$, $1 + -: Meas \to Meas$. A probability measure on $1 + X$ is a subprobability measure on $X$. Panangaden's monad is a composite of Giry's and $1 + -$.
