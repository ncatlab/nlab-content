## Idea

Quantum hadrodynamics is (or should be) an [[effective field theory]] that describes [[confinement|confined]] [[hadron]] [[bound states]] in [[nuclear physics]], in particular the [[interaction]] between [[mesons]] and [[baryons]] and specifically with [[nucleons]].

In this sense [[chiral perturbation theory]] is the archetype of quantum hadrodynamics, but the latter term is commonly used more specifically for the [[Walecka model]] and its generalizations (QHD-I [Walecka 74](#Walecka74) and  QHD-II [Serot 79](#Serot79), [Serot-Walecka 92](#SerotWalecka92), [Serot-Walecka 97](#SerotWalecka97)) to [[baryon chiral perturbation theory]], where the [[baryons]] and specifically the [[nucleons]] appear as explicit [[effective field theory|effective]] [[field (physics)|fields]] (as opposed to as emergent [[Skyrmion]] fields).
