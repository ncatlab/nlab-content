Let $G$ be a commutative (Hausdorff) [[topological group]]. A (continuous) *character* of $G$ is any continuous homomorphism $\chi:G\to S^1$. The __Pontrjagin dual group__ $\hat{G}$ is the commutative group of all characters of $G$ with pointwise multiplication (that is multiplication induced by multiplication of norm $1$ complex numbers in $S^1\subset\mathbb{C}$) and with the topology of uniform convergence on each compact $K\subset G$ (this is equivalent to the compact open topology). 

For example, the Pontrjagin dual of the additive group of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is the circle $S^1$, and conversely, $\mathbb{Z}$ is the Pontrjagin dual of $S^1$. This pair of dual topological groups is related to the subject of Fourier series. Group $\hat{\mathbb{R}}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$.

**Pontrjagin duality theorem**: For every [[locally compact space|locally compact]] (Hausdorff) topological abelian group $G$, the natural function $G\mapsto \widehat{\widehat{G}}$ of $G$ into the Pontrjagin dual of the Pontrjagin dual of $G$, assigning to every $g\in G$ the continuous character $f_g$ given by $f_g(\chi)=\chi(g)$, is an isomorphism of topological groups. 

The [[Fourier transform]] on locally compact abelian groups is formulated in terms of Pontrjagin duals. 

There is a recent categorification of the Pontrjagin duality theorem by U. Bunke and T. Schick, motivated by applications to topological [[T-duality]].
