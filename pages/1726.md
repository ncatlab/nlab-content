## Idea

An _$n$-fold complete Segal space_ is a [[homotopy theory]]-version of an [[n-fold category]]: an $n$-fold [[category object in an (infinity,1)-category|category object internal to]] [[∞Grpd]] hence an [[n-category object in an (∞,1)-category]], hence an object in  $Cat(Cat(\cdots Cat(\infty Grpd)))$. This is a model for an _[[(∞,n)-category]]_.


A [[complete Segal space]] is to be thought of as the [[nerve]] of a category which is _[[homotopy coherent category theory|homotopically]]_ [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Top]]: it is a simplicial object in [[Top]], $X^\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ satisfying some conditions and thought of as a model for an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]]. 

An $(\infty,n)$-category is in its essence the $(n-1)$-fold iteration of this process: recursively, it is a category which is _[[homotopy coherent category theory|homotopically]]_ [[enriched category|enriched]] over $(\infty,n-1)$-categories.

This implies then in particular that an $(\infty,n)$-category in this sense is an $n$-fold simplicial topological space
$$
  X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \times 
     \Delta^{op} \times \cdots \times \Delta^{op}
     \to Top
$$

which satisfies the condition of [[complete Segal space|Segal spaces]] -- the [[Segal condition]] (characterizing also [[nerves]] of [[categories]]) in each variable, in that all the squares

$$
  \array{
     X_{m+n,\bullet} &\to& X_{n,\bullet}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X_{m,\bullet} &\to& X_{0,\bullet}
  }
$$

are [[homotopy coherent category theory|homotopy pullbacks]] of $(n-1)$-fold Segal spaces.

In analogy of how it works for [[complete Segal spaces]], the completness condition on an $n$-fold complete Segal space demands that the $(n-1)$-fold complete Segal space in degree zero is (under suitable identifications) the 
[[infinity-groupoid]] which is the [[core]] of the [[(infinity,n)-category]] which is being presented. Since the embedding of $\infty$-groupoids into ($n-1$)-fold complete Segal spaces is by adding lots of degeneracies, this means that the completeness condition on an $n$-fold complete Segal space involves lots of degeneracy conditions in degree 0.
