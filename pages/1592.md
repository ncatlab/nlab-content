Let $B$ be a topological space which is [[path-connected space|path-connected]], [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply-connected space|semi-locally simply-connected]] (or more briefly, _[[well-connected space|well-connected]]_). Then there is a connected and simply connected [[covering space]] $B^{(1)} \to B$ such that for any other covering space $\widetilde{B} \to B$ there is a map of covering spaces $B^{(1)} \to \widetilde{B}$. There is a functorial construction of a covering space of a pointed space
$$
Top_*^{wc} \to Cov_*
$$
where $Top_*^{wc}$ is the full subcategory of $Top_*$ with objects the well-connected spaces and $Cov$ is the subcategory of $Top_*^2$ of pointed maps of spaces with objects the covering space maps.

[[David Roberts]]: We should move the construction of the universal covering space from [[covering space]] to here, but I have limited time.
