__Jean-Louis Loday__ (deceased June 2012) was a French mathematician who was, at the time of his passing, _Directeur de Recherche au CNRS_ based in Strasbourg. He is well known for his work in [[algebraic K-theory]], in the development of [[cyclic homology]] and more recently for work on [[operads]] and [[Leibniz algebras]].
