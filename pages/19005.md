## Idea

For [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] the [[moduli space]] of [[vacuum expectation values]] (VEVs) of the theory is locally a direct product between the moduli of the vector multiplet and those of the hypermultiplet. The former is called the [[Coulomb branch]], and the latter the **Higgs branch**.
