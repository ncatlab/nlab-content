## Idea


For [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] the [[moduli space]] of [[vacuum expectation values]] (VEVs) of the theory is locally a [[Cartesian product]] between the space of [[moduli]] of the [[vector multiplet]] (the [[gauge field]] sector) and those of the [[hypermultiplet]] (the matter field sector). The former is called the [[Coulomb branch]], and the latter the _Higgs branch. These are [[duality in physics|dual]] to each other to it under a version of [[mirror symmetry]] . 

This is the topic of [[Seiberg-Witten theory]].

Definitions of the Coulomb and Higgs branches have been extended to [[N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills theory]].

## Definition

### D=4

### D=3
