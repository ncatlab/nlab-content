An $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-functor|functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **essentially surjective** if, when modeled as a functor of [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]], the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|induced]]
functor 
$$
  h F_0 : h C_0 \to h D_0
$$ 
of ordinary categories is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]
