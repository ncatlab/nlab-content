## Idea

The _blob complex_ maybe thought of as a generalization of the [[Hochschild complex]] to [[higher category theory|higher categories]] and higher dimensional [[manifold]]s.  

One thinks of the Hochschild complex as associated to a 1-[[category]] and a 1-[[manifold]] (the circle).  Itâ€™s a fairly small complex, analogous to cellular homology.  The blob complex for the same input data (1-category and circle) yields a [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] but much much larger [[chain complex]], analogous to [[singular homology]].  

Its advantage over the Hochschild complex is that it is "local".  In higher dimensions this locality means that it is easy to (well-) define the blob complex of an [[n-category]] + n-manifold without choosing any sort of decomposition of the n-manifold.


## Definition

There are two definitions.  The second is more general, and is homotopy equivalent to the first when both are available.  See references below for more details.


### First definition

* Start with a linear [[n-category]] $C$ with [[strong duality]] -- a [[blob n-category]] -- (e.g. [[pivotal 2-category]]) and an $n$-[[manifold]] $M$.

* Define $B_0(M)$ to be finite linear combinations of 
  "$C$-[[string diagram]]s" drawn on $M$.

* Define $B_1(M)$ to be finite linear combinations of triples $(B, u, r)$, where $B \subset M$ is a ball, $r$ is a [[string diagram]] on $M\setminus B$, and $u$ is a linear combination of string diagrams on which evaluates to zero.

* Define $B_2(M)$ to be ...

## Related concepts

Blob homology has some similarities with 

* [[factorization algebra]]

* [[local net]]s in [[AQFT]].

It should be closely related to

* [[topological chiral homology]].
