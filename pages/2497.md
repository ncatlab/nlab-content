One way of thinking of the blob complex is as a generalization of the [[Hochschild complex]] to [[higher category theory|higher categories]] and higher dimensional manifolds.  

One thinks of the Hochschild complex as associated to a 1-[[category]] and a 1-[[manifold]] (the circle).  Itâ€™s a fairly small complex, analogous to cellular homology.  The blob complex for the same input data (1-category and circle) yields a [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] but much much larger [[chain complex]], analogous to [[singular homology]].  

Its advantage over the Hochschild complex is that it is "local".  In higher dimensions this locality means that it is easy to (well-) define the blob complex of an [[n-category]] + n-manifold without choosing any sort of decomposition of the n-manifold.
