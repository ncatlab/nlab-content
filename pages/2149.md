## Definition

Given a [[sheaf]] $F$ of [[sets]] over a [[topological space]] $X$, the [[section]] over an *arbitrary* (= not necessarily open) subset $V\subset X$ is a continuous section of the corresponding [[etale space]] restricted to $V$. 

A [[sheaf]] $F$ of sets (or of [[abelian groups]]) over a [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[Hausdorff space]] $X$ is __soft__ if for any [[closed subset]] $V\subset X$, every section of $F$ over $V$ can be extended to the whole $X$. 

## Properties

The local extension of germs to the open neighborhoods of points by paracompactness gives rise to an extension of the section to an [[open neighborhood]] of the whole set $V$. Therefore every [[flabby sheaf]] is soft, because flabbiness gives the extension from open subsets. [[fine sheaf|Fine sheaves]] are always soft.
