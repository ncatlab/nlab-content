Given a sheaf $F$ of sets over a topological space $X$, the section over an *arbitrary* (= not necessarily open) subset $V\subset X$ is a continuous section of the corresponding [[etale space]] restricted to $V$. 

A [[sheaf]] $F$ of sets (or of abelian groups) over a paracompact Hausdorff space $X$ is soft if for any closed subset $V\subset X$, every section of $F$ over $V$ can be extended to the whole $X$. The local extension of germs to the open neighborhoods of points by paracompactness gives rise to an extension of the section to an open neighborhoods of the whole $V$. Therefore every [[flabby sheaf]] is soft, because flabbiness gives the extension from open subsets. [[fine sheaf|Fine sheaves]] are always soft. 

Standard references are [[Tohoku]] and the Godement's book.
