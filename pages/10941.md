Let $R$ be a ring or, more generally, an associative $k$-algebra, where $k$ is a commutative unital ring. 

Assuming the axiom of choice, one of the standard characterizations of the [[projective module|projective]] (say left) $R$-module $M$ is that there is an epimorphism $F\to P$ from a free $R$-module which is [[split epimorphism|split]] ("$P$ is a direct summand of a free module").

Equivalently, an $R$-module $M$ is projective iff it has a __dual basis__ $\{(x_i,x_i^*)\in M\times Hom_k(M,R)\}_{i\in I}$ in the following sense. There is a free $R$-module $F = \oplus_{i\in I} R$, an epimorphism of $R$-modules $F\to M$ $\oplus_i R \ni \sum_i r_i\mapsto \sum_i r_i x_i$ which is split, i.e. has a right inverse, where this inverse, by the universal property of the direct sum, must be of the form $x\mapsto \sum_i x_i^*(x)x_i\in \oplus_i R$ where $x_i^*\in Hom_k(M,R)$ and  $(\forall x)$ $x_i^*(x)\neq 0$ for only finitely many $i\in I$.
In particular, $x_i^*(x_j) = \delta_i^j$ (Kronecker delta).

This terminology is related to but a bit different than in the case of $k$-vector spaces (cf. at [[dual vector space]]). 
If $V$ has a vector space
basis $(x_j)_j$ is a basis of $V$ then $x_i^*$ _defined by_ $x_i^*(x_j) = \delta_i^j$ is not necessarily a basis of $V^* = Hom_k(V,k)$; it is
if $V$ is finite dimensional.  In the case of projective module $M$, 
$x_i$ do not form a basis in a free sense, 
but only a set of generators and  
with the property that there exist another set $x_i^*$ in $M^*$ 
such that they together form a "dual basis". (Still, one sometimes says
that $x_i^*$ form a basis dual to $x_i$.)
