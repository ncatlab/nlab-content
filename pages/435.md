## Definition ##

A _simplicially enriched category_ is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[simplicial sets]].

These enriched categories are sometimes, somewhat imprecisely, called just _[[simplicial categories]]_.


## Remarks ##


* Simplicially enriched categories are one model for [[(âˆž,1)-categories]]. They are a popular model in [[homotopy coherent category theory]].


## Simplicial groupoids ##

There is a related notion of [[simplicial groupoid]] with the added requirement that all arrows in the categories concerned are [[isomorphisms]].
