
An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **fully faithful** if, when modeled as a functor of [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]] the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|induced]]
functor on [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy categories]]

$$
  h F : h C \to h D
$$ 

of $Ho_{Top}$-[[enriched category|enriched categories]] is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]], i.e. if the morphisms

$$
  h F_{X,Y} : h C(X,Y) \to h D(F(X), F(Y))
$$

are [[isomorphism]]s in $Ho_{Top}$ for all objects $X, Y$.
