## Idea

A _linear representation_ is a [[representation]] on a [[category]] of [[vector spaces]] or similar ([[Vect]], [[Mod]], etc.)

This is the most common flavor of [[representations]]. One sometimes considers representations on objects other than linear spaces (such as [[permutation representations]]) but often these are called not representations but _[[actions]]_.

## Properties

### Characters of linear representations

See _[[characters of linear representations]]_.

### Characteristic classes of linear representations
 {#ChernClassesOfLinearRepresentations}

Under the [[Atiyah-Segal completion]] map [[linear representations]] of a [[group]] $G$ induce [[topological K-theory]] classes on the [[classifying space]] $B G$. Their [[Chern classes]] are hence invariants of the [[linear representations]] themselves.

See at _[[characteristic class of a linear representation]]_ for more.
