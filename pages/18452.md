## Idea

A _linear representation_ is a [[representation]] on a [[category]] of [[vector spaces]] or similar ([[Vect]], [[Mod]], etc.)

This is the most common flavor of [[representations]]. One sometimes considers representations on objects other than linear spaces (such as [[permutation representations]]) but often these are called not representations but _[[actions]]_.
