## Idea

String field theory is supposed to be something like a  [[quantum field theory]] which is the [[second quantization]] of the [[string]] in [[string theory]], following this analogy:

[[!include second quantization -- table]]


Recall that [[string theory|perturbative string theory]] is a higher dimensional version of the Feynman [[perturbation series]] in [[quantum field theory]]. This Feynman perturbation series may be understood as computing the path integral over the Lagrangian of the given quantum field theory. _String field theory_ is the attempt to identify this Lagrangian description corresponding to the string perturbation series.

So string field theory is the attempt to complete the following analogy:

Feynman perturbation series : QFT Lagrangian  :: String perturbation theory : String field theory .

### Motivation

The original hope was that string field theory would be a way to embed the string perturbation series prescription into a more coherent non-perturbative framework. 

### Achievements
 {#Achievements}

The most detailed insight that has come out of the study of string field theory is the full understanding of the role of the "tachyon" field in bosonic perturbative string theory. In the bosonic version of the theory one of the excitations of the string is a quantum that appears to have imaginary mass. Such "tachyonic" quanta appear in ordinary field theory when the perturbation series is developed around an extremum of the QFT action functional that is not a local minimum, but a local maximum: it indicates that the  classical configuration around which the perturbation series computes the quantum corrections is dynamically unstable and time evolution will tend to evolve it to the next local minimum. In the perturbative quantum description the movement to the next local minimum manifests itself in the _condensation_ (as in [[Bose-Einstein condensation]]) of the tachyon field. This is called _tachyon condensation_.

Shortly after its conception it was suspected that the tachyon that appears in the perturbation theory of the bosonic string is similarly an indication that the bosonic string's perturbation series has to be understood as being a perturbation about a local maximum of some action functional. String field theory aimed to provide that notion of action functional. And indeed, in bosonic string field theory one has a kind of higher action functional and may compute the "tachyon potential" that it implies. It indeed has a local maximum at the point about which the ordinary bosonic string perturbation series is a perturbative expansion, while a local minimum is foun nearby. 

[[Ashoke Sen]] conjectured the statement -- now known as _[[Sen's conjecture]]_ -- that the depth of this tachyon potential, i.e. the energy density difference between this local maximum and this local minimum corresponds precisely to the energy density of the space-filling [[D25-brane]] that is seen in [[perturbative string theory]]. This would mean that the condensation of the bosonic string's tachyon corresponds to the decay of the unstable space-filling D25 brane. 

The detailed quantitative confirmation of Sen's conjecture has been one of the main successes of string field theory. In the course of this a detailed algebraic description of the "true closed bosonic string vacuum", i.e. of the theory at that local tachyon potential minimum has been found. However, the algebraic expressions involved tend to be hard to handle in their complexity.

There are numerical indications that indeed as the D25-brane decays, the remaining vacuum contains (only) closed strings. See the [references below](#BosonicStringVacuumAndSenConjecture).

### Shortcomings

The shortcoming of the current development of string field theory can probably be summarized as follows:

* it has been studied as a theory of a _classical_ action functional. Little is known about the true quantum effects of the string field theory action functional.

* the best understanding exists for bosonic open string field theory, while closed and supersymmetric string field theory has remained much less accessible.

### In terms of higher category theory

Closed string field theory is governed by an [[L-infinity algebra]] of interactions, open string field theory by an [[A-infinity algebra]] and open-closed string field theory by a mixture of both: an [[open-closed homotopy algebra]].

## Bosonic open string field theory

(...)

## Bosononic closed string field theory

So far string field theory is defined in terms of an [[action functional]]. So, strictly speaking, it is defined as a [[classical field theory]]. The corresponding [[BV-BRST formalism|quantum master action]] is known, but apart from that not much detail about the [[quantization]] of this action has been considered in the literature.


### The interaction terms

The unrestricted [[configuration space]] of string field theory is the subcomplex of the [[BRST complex]] of the closed ([[superstring|super]]-)[[string]], regarded as a $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded vector space]] with respect to the ghost number grading, on those elements $\Psi$ that satisfy

1. $(b_0 - \bar b_0) \Psi = 0$;

1. $(L_0 - \bar L_0) \Psi = 0$ ("level matching condition"),


We shall write $\mathfrak{g}$ for this graded vector space. See ([Markl, section 1](#Markl))

This is equipped for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with a $k$-ary operation

$$
  [-,\cdots,-]_k : \mathfrak{g}^{\otimes k} \to \mathfrak{g}
$$

given by the [[correlator|(k+1)-point function]] of the string (the amplitude for $k$ closed strings coming in and merging into a single outgoing string). For $k = 1$ this is the [[BRST complex|BRST operator]]

$$
  [-]_1 = d_{BRST}
  \,.
$$

These operations are graded-symmetric: for all $\{\Psi_j\}$ of homogeneous degree $deg \Psi_j$ and for all $0 \leq i \lt k$ we have

\[
  \label{GradedSymmetrykBracket}
  [\Psi_1 , \cdots, \Psi_i, \Psi_{i+1}, \cdots, \Psi_k]_k
  =
  (-1)^{(deg \Psi_i)(deg \Psi_{i+1})}
  [\Psi_1 , \cdots, \Psi_{i+1}, \Psi_{i}, \cdots, \Psi_k]_k .
\]

([Zwiebach, (4.4)](#Zwiebach)).

Moreover, there is a bilinear [[inner product]]

$$
  \langle -,- \rangle : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{C}
$$

coming from the [[Hilbert space]] inner product of string states ([Zwiebach (2.60)](#Zwiebach)). This is non-degenerate on elements $\Psi$ which are annihilated by the [[BRST complex|ghost]] operator 

$$
  b_0^- := b_0 - \bar b_0
$$

in that for all $A \in \mathfrak{g}$ with  $b_0^- A = 0$ we have

\[
  \label{NonDegeneracyOfInnerProduct}
  (\forall B \in \mathfrak{g} \,:\,
  \langle A,B\rangle = 0)
  \Rightarrow
  A = 0  
  \,.
\]

This is ([Zwiebach, (2.61)](#Zwiebach)).


The inner product satisfies for all $\Psi_1, \Psi_2$ of homogeneous degree the relation

\[
  \label{GradedSymmetryBilinearPairing}
  \langle \Psi_1 , \psi_2 \rangle
  = 
  (-1)^{(deg \Psi_1 + 1) (deg \Psi_2 + 1)}
  \langle \Psi_2, \Psi_1 \rangle
\]

([Zwiebach, (2.50)](#Zwiebach)).


Moreover, it is non-vanishing only on pairs of elements of total degree 5. ([Zwiebach, (2.31)(2.44)](#Zwiebach)).

From this one constructs the $(n+1)$-point functions

\[
  \label{CorrelationFunctions}
  \{ \Psi_0, \Psi_1, \cdots, \Psi_k \}
  :=
  \langle \Psi_0, [\Psi_1, \cdots, \Psi_k]_k \rangle
  \,.
\]

These are still graded-symmetric in all arguments: for all $\{\Psi_j\}$ of homogeneous degree $deg \Psi_j$ and all $0 \leq i \lt k$ we have

\[
  \label{GradedSymmetrykPointFunction}
  \{\Psi_0, \cdots, \Psi_i, \Psi_{i+1}, \cdots, \Psi_k\}
  = 
  (-1)^{(deg \Psi_i)(deg \Psi_{i+1})}
  \{\Psi_0, \cdots, \Psi_{i+1}, \Psi_{i}, \cdots, \Psi_k\}
  \,.
\]

([Zwiebach, (4.36)](#Zwiebach)).


### The action functional

+-- {: .num_defn #LabelConfigurationSpace}
###### Definition

The proper [[configuration space]] of string field theory is the sub-complex of the [[BRST complex]] of the closed ([[superstring|super]]-)[[string]] on those elements $\Psi$ for which

1. $(b_0 - \bar b_0) \vert\Psi\rangle = 0$;

1. $(L_0 - \bar L_0) \vert \Psi \rangle = 0$ ("level matching condition");

1. $\vert \Psi \rangle^\dagger = - (\langle \Psi \vert)$ ("reality");

1. $\vert \Psi\rangle$ is Grassmann even (...define...)

1. $ghostnumber \vert \Psi \rangle = 2$ (...define...)

=--

This is ([Zwiebach, (3.9)](#Zwiebach))


The _[[action functional]]_ of closed string field theory is 

$$
  S : \Psi 
   \mapsto 
   \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
   \frac{1}{(k+1)!}
   \langle \Psi, [\Psi, \cdots, \Psi]_k\rangle
  \,.
$$

([Zwiebach, (4.41)](#Zwiebach))


Since $[-]_1 = d_{BRST}$ is the [[BRST complex|BRST operator]] this starts out as

$$
  S : \Psi 
  = 
  \frac{1}{2}\langle \Psi , d_{BRST} \Psi \rangle
  + 
  \frac{1}{3} \langle \Psi, [\Psi, \Psi]_2\rangle
  + 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

### As an $\infty$-Chern-Simons theory
 {#AsAnInfinityCSTheory}

The above action functional for closed string field theory turns out to have a general abstract meaning in [[higher category theory]]/[[homotopy theory]]. We spell out here how the action functional for closed string field theory is an example of an [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] in that it arises precisely as the [[Chern-Simons element]] of the binary pairing regarded as a binary [[invariant polynomial]] on the [[L-∞ algebra]] of string fields.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The string [[BRST complex]] equipped with its $k$-ary interaction genus-0 interaction vertices  

$$
  (\mathfrak{g}, \{[-,\cdots,-]_k\})
$$ 

is an [[L-∞ algebra]].

=--

This is ([Zwiebach, (4.12)](#Zwiebach)). For more details on the $L_\infty$-structure see _[References -- Relation to L-∞- and A-∞-algebra](ReferencesHomotopyAlgebra))_ .

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The inner product $\langle -,-\rangle$ satisfies the definition of a non-degenerate [[invariant polynomial]] on this $L_\infty$-algebra when restricted to fields of even degree as in def. \ref{LabelConfigurationSpace}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For simplicity of notation we discuss this as if $\mathfrak{g}$ were finite-dimensional. The argument for the infinite-dimensional case follows analogously.

Let $\{t_a\}$ be a [[basis]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ with dual basis $\{t^a\}$. Then the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ is generated from the $\{t^a\}$ with [[differential]] given by

$$
  d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} 
   : 
  t^a
  \mapsto
  -
  \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
  \frac{1}{k!} [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]_k \,\,
  t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  \,.
$$

The [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is similarly generated from $\{t^a, r^a\}$ with differential

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} 
   : 
  t^a
  \mapsto
  -
  \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
  \frac{1}{k!} [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}] \,\,
  t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  + r^a
$$

and

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} 
  : 
  r^a 
    \mapsto
  \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
  \frac{1}{k!}
  [t_{a_0}, t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]_{k+1}
  \,
  r^{a_0} \wedge t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  \,.
$$

Write

$$
  P_{a b} := \langle t_a, t_b\rangle
$$

for the components of the bilinear pairing in this basis. By (eq:GradedSymmetryBilinearPairing) it follows that we can indeed regard

$$
  P_{a b} r^a \wedge r^b
  \in W(\mathfrak{g})
$$

as an element in the [[Weil algebra]] (since $deg r^a = deg t^a + 1$).

Therefore to see that this is an [[invariant polynomial]] it remains to check that it is $d_W$-closed. To see this, first introduce the notation

$$
  C_{a_0, \cdots, a_k} :=
  \{t_{a_0}, \cdots, t_{a_k}\}
$$

for the components of the $(k+1)$-point function (eq:CorrelationFunctions). Then compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} P_{a b } r^a \wedge r^b
     & = 
     2 P_{a b} r^a \wedge 
     \left(
        \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
        [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]_k
        \,
        r^{a_1} \wedge t^{a_2}\wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
     \right)
     \\
     & = 
     2 \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
     C_{a_0, a_1, \cdots, a_k}
     \,
     r^{a_0} \wedge r^{a_1} \wedge t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This expression vanishes term-by-term by the symmetry properties (eq:GradedSymmetrykPointFunction) when restricted to fields of even degree: by first switching the factors in the wedge product and then relabelling the indices we obtain

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  C_{a_0,  a_1, \cdots, a_k} r^{a_0} \wedge r^{a_1}
  &= 
  (-1)^{(deg t_{a_0} + 1)(deg t_{a_1} + 1) + (deg t_{a_0})(deg t_{a_1})}
  C_{a_0,  a_1, \cdots, a_k} r^{a_0} \wedge r^{a_1}
  \\
  & = 
  (-1)^{deg t_{a_0}  + deg t_{a_1} + 1}
  C_{a_0,  a_1, \cdots, a_k} r^{a_0} \wedge r^{a_1}
  \\
  & =
  (-1)
  C_{a_0,  a_1, \cdots, a_k} r^{a_0} \wedge r^{a_1}
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the last step we used the constraints on degrees given by def. \ref{LabelConfigurationSpace}.

This shows that $\langle-,-\rangle$ satisfies the defining equation of an invariant polynomial on the proper configuration space. The non-degeneracy is due to (eq:NonDegeneracyOfInnerProduct).

=--

From the discussion at [[Chern-Simons element]] in the section [Canonical Chern-Simons element](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Chern-Simons+element#CanonicalChernSimonsElement) we have that the [[Lagrangian]] of the [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]] defined by the data $(\mathfrak{g}, \langle -,-\rangle)$ is

$$
  L : A \mapsto 
  \langle A,  d A\rangle
  + 
  \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
  \frac{2}{(k+1)!}
  \langle A , [A, \cdots , A]_k\rangle
$$

for $A$ a $\mathfrak{g}$-[[infinity-Lie algebroid valued differential form|valued differential form]] on some $\Sigma$. So the closed string field theory action looks like that of $\infty$-Chern-Simons theory over an odd-graded $\Sigma$.

## Open-Closed string field theory
 {#OpenClosedStringFieldTheory}

When considering open and closed strings jointly, then in addition to the closed string sector being encoded by an [[L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}_{closed}$ as above, the open string sector is encoded in an [[A-∞ algebra]] $A_{open}$ and the former acts on the latter by homotopy [[derivations]] (see also at _[derivations on algebras over a dg-operad](derivation#OfAlgebrasOverADGOperad)_)

$$
  \mathfrak{g}_{closed} \longrightarrow Der (A_{open})
$$

([Kajiura-Stasheff 04](#KajiuraStasheff04), [Markl 04](#Markl04)).

Notice that this is half of the axioms of an $\infty$-[[Lie-Rinehart pair]].

## Superstring field theory
 {#SuperstringFieldTheory}

The maybe most wide-spread attempt to generalize the above to [[superstring]] field theory replaces the Chern-Simons-type action with a [[Wess-Zumino-Witten theory]]-type action, see at _[[WZW-type superstring field theory]]_ .

A formulation of superstring field theory more on line with the Chern-Simons type bosonic theory is proposed in ([Jurco-Muenster 13](#JurcoMuenster13)). See also the introduction there for a survey of the literature

by seeking a Chern-Simons like action for open superstrings similar to the one of open bosonic string field theory ([Witten 86](#Witten86)). The major obstacle compared to the bosonic string is the necessity of [[picture changing operators]]. Indeed, the cubic superstring theory of ([Witten 86a](#Witten86a)) turns out to be inconsistent due to singularities arising form the collision of picture changing operators

On the other hand, the construction of bosonic closed string field theory ([Zwiebach 92](#Zwiebach)) takes its origin in the [[moduli space]] of closed [[Riemann surfaces]]. Vertices represent a subspace of the moduli space, such that the moduli space decomposes uniquely into vertices and graphs,and do not apriori require a background. Graphs are constructed from the vertices by sewing together punctures along prescribed local coordinates around the punctures. But an assignment of local coordinates around the punctures, globally on the moduli space, is possible only up to rotations. This fact implies the level matching condition and via gauge
invariance also the $b_0^- = 0$ constraint.

In an almost unnoticed work ([Yeh](#Yeh93)), the geometric approach developed in bosonic closed string field theory, as described in the previous paragraph, has been generalized to the context of superstring field theory. Neveu-Schwarz punctures behave quite similar to punctures
in the bosonic case, but a Ramond puncture describes a divisor on a super Riemann surface rather than a point. As a consequence, local coordinates around Ramond punctures, globally defined over super moduli space, can be fixed only up to rotations and translation in the Ramond divisor.

A given background provides forms on super moduli space

* L. Alvarez-Gaume, P. Nelson, C. Gomez, G. Sierra, C. Vafa, _Fermionic strings in the operator formalism_, Nuclear Physics B, Volume 311, Issue 2.

in the sense of [[integration over supermanifolds|geometric integration theory on supermanifolds]], and in particular the geometric meaning
of picture changing operators has been clarified 

* [[Alexander Belopolsky]], _Picture changing operators in supergeometry and superstring theory_ ([arXiv:hep-th/9706033](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9706033)).

Integrating along an odd direction in moduli space inevitably generates a picture changing operator. Thus, the ambiguity of defining local coordinates around Ramond punctures produces a picture changing operator
associated with the vector field generating translations in the Ramond divisor. The bpz inner product plus the additional insertions originating from the sewing define the [[symplectic form]] relevant for 
[[BV quantization]]. As in the bosonic case, we require that the symplectic form has to be non-degenerate, but the fact that the picture changing operator present in the Ramond sector has a non-trivial kernel, forces to impose additional restrictions besides the level matching and $b_0^- = 0$ constraint on the state space.
The purpose of ([Jurco-Muenster 13](#JurcoMuenster13)) is to describe the construction of type II superstring field theory in the geometric approach.
