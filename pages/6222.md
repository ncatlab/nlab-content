
A group is __solvable__ if it is a finite iterated extension of an abelian group by abelian groups. In other words, there exists a finite sequence 

$$
\{ 1\}\subset G_1 \subset G_2 \subset \ldots \subset G_k = G,
$$

in which $G_{j-1}$ is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in $G_j$ and $G_j/G_{j-1}$ is [[abelian group|abelian]].

The terminology comes from elementary [[Galois theory]]: every [[polynomial]] equation has a corresponding [[Galois group]], and the equation has a solution expressible using the field operations and extraction of roots if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group.
