## Definition

A [[group]] is __solvable__ if it is a [[finite number|finite]] iterated [[group extension]] of an [[abelian group]] by [[abelian groups]]. 

In other words, there exists a finite sequence 

$$
  \{ 1\}\subset G_1 \subset G_2 \subset \ldots \subset G_k = G,
$$

in which $G_{j-1}$ is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in $G_j$ and $G_j/G_{j-1}$ is [[abelian group|abelian]].

## Examples

### Galois groups

The terminology "solvable groups" comes from elementary [[Galois theory]]: every [[polynomial]] [[equation]] $\phi$ over an [[integral domain]] $K$ has a corresponding [[Galois group]] $Gal(\phi/K)$, and $Gal(\phi/K)$ is a solvable group if and only if $\phi$ is a [[solvable polynomial equation|solvable equation]] (meaning that all its solutions in an [[algebraic closure]] of $K$ are expressible using the elements of $K$, the field operations, and extraction of roots).


### Nilpotent groups

A [[nilpotent group]] is a solvable group given by *[[central extensions|central]]* [[group extensions]].
