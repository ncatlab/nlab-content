
A group is __solvable__ if it is a finite iterated extension of an abelian group by abelian groups. In other words, there exists a finite sequence 

$$
\{ 1\}\subset G_1 \subset G_2 \subset \ldots \subset G_k = G,
$$

in which $G_{j-1}$ is [[normal subgroup|normal]] in $G_j$ and $G_j/G_{j-1}$ is [[abelian group|abelian]].

The terminology comes from elementary [[Galois theory]]: every [[polynomial]] equation $\phi$ over an [[integral domain]] $K$ has a corresponding [[Galois group]] $Gal(\phi/K)$, and $Gal(\phi/K)$ is a solvable group if and only if $\phi$ is a solvable equation in the sense that all its solutions in an [[algebraic closure]] (or any other sufficiently large [[splitting field]]) of $K$ are expressible using the coefficients of $\phi$, the field operations, and extraction of roots.
