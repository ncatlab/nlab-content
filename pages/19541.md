## Idea

The [[category]] of [[chain complexes of super vector spaces]] over a [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]] carries a _projective_ [[model category]] [[structure]] whose [[weak equivalences]] are the underlying [[quasi-isomorphisms]] and whose [[fibrations]] are the degreewise [[surjections]] (all either in unbounded degree, in non-negative degree or in non-positive degree).

 
The model structure is hence the direct generalization of the projective [[model structure on chain complexes]] of plain [[vector spaces]], to which it reduces on the objects concentrated in even super-degree.
