The _special unitary group_ is the [[subgroup]] of the [[unitary group]] on the elements with [[determinant]] equal to 1.

For $n$ a [[natural number]],  the **special unitary group** $SU(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$ which preserve the [[volume form]] on this space. It is the [[subgroup]] of the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ consisting of the $n \times n$ [[unitary matrix|unitary]] [[matrix|matrices]] with [[determinant]] $1$.

More generally, for $V$ any complex [[vector space]] equipped with a nondegenerate [[Hermitian form]] $Q$, $SU(V,Q)$ is the group of isometries of $V$ which preserve the volume form derived from $Q$.  One may write $SU(V)$ if $Q$ is obvious, so that $SU(n)$ is the same as $SU(\mathbb{C}^n)$.  By $SU(p,q)$, we mean $SU(\mathbb{C}^{p+q},Q)$, where $Q$ has $p$ positive [[eigenvalue]]s and $q$ negative ones.
