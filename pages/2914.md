###### Proposition


For $C$ a [[model category]] and $X \in C$ an [[object]], the [[over category]] $C/X$ as well as the [[undercategory]] $X/C$ inherit themselves structures of model categories whose [[fibrations]], [[cofibration]]s and [[weak equivalences]] are precisely the morphism that become fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences in $C$ under the forgetful functor $C/X \to C$ or $X/C \to C$.

## Properties ##

### Cofibrant generation, properness, combinatoriality

+-- {: .num_prop #ModelStructureInheritsGoodProperties}
###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{C}$ is

* a [[cofibrantly generated model category]]

* or a [[proper model category]]

* or a [[cellular model category]]

then so are $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$.

More in detail, if $I,J \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ are the classes of [[generating cofibrations]] and of generating acylic cofibrations of $\mathcal{C}$, respectively, then 

* the generating (acyclic) cofibrations of $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$ are the image under $X \sqcup(-)$ of those of $\mathcal{C}$.

This is spelled out in ([Hirschhorn 05](#Hirschhorn05)).

+-- {: .num_prop #ModelStructureInheritsCombinatorial}
###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[combinatorial model category]], then so is $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [basic properties](locally+presentable+category#Properties) of [[locally presentable categories]] they are stable under slicing. Hence with $\mathcal{C}$ locally presentable also $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ is, 
and by prop. \ref{ModelStructureInheritsGoodProperties} with $\mathcal{C}$ cofibrantly generated also $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ is.

+-- {: .num_prop #ModelStructureInheritsEnriched}
###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[cartesian enriched model category]], then so is $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By basic properties of [[cartesian enriched categories]] they are stable under slicing, where tensoring is computed in $\mathcal{C}$.
Hence with $\mathcal{C}$ enriched also $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ is.
The [[pushout product axiom]] now follows from the fact
that in overcategories pushouts can be computed in the underlying category $\mathcal{C}$.
The [[unit axiom]] follows from the unit axiom of $\mathcal{C}$
using the fact that tensorings are computed in $\mathcal{C}$.

### Derived hom-spaces

+-- {: .num_prop #PresentationOfSliceInfinityCat}
###### Proposition

If $C$ is a [[simplicial model category]] and $X \in C$ is fibrant, then
the [[overcategory]] $C/X$ with the above slice model structure is a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of the 
[[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C^\circ / X$: we have an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  (C/X)^\circ \simeq C^\circ / X
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that we have an [[essentially surjective (∞,1)-functor]] $C^\circ/X \to (C/X)^\circ$. What has to be shown is that this is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] in that it is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] on all [[hom-object|hom]]-[[∞-groupoid]]s $C^\circ/X(a,b) \simeq (C/X)^\circ(a,b)$.

To see this, notice that the hom-space in an [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C^\circ/X$ between objects $a : A \to X$ and $b : B \to X$ is given (as discussed there) by the 
[[(∞,1)-pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\circ/X(A \stackrel{a}{\to} X, B \stackrel{b}{\to} X) 
     &\to& C^\circ(A,B)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{b_*}}
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{a}{\to}& C^\circ(A,X)
  }
$$

in [[∞Grpd]].

Let $A \in C$ be a cofibrant representative and $b : B \to X$ be a 
fibration representative in $C$ (which always exists) of the objects of these names in $C^\circ$, respectively. In terms of these we have a cofibration

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &&\hookrightarrow&& A
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{a}}
    \\ 
    && X
  }
$$

in $C/X$, exhibiting $a$ as a cofibrant object of $C/X$;  and a fibration

$$
  \array{
    B &&\stackrel{b}{\to}&& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{b}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{Id}}
    \\ 
    && X
  }
$$

in $C/X$, exhibiting $b$ as a fibrant object in $C/X$.
 
Moreover, the diagram in [[sSet]] given by

$$
  \array{
    C/X(a, b) &\to& C(A,B)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{b_*}}
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{a}{\to}& C(A,X)
  }
$$

is 

1. a [[pullback]] diagram in [[sSet]] (by the definition of morphism in an ordinary [[overcategory]]);

1. a [[homotopy pullback]] in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]], because  by the axioms on the [[sSet]]${}_{Quillen}$ [[enriched model category]] $C$ and the above (co)fibrancy assumptions, all objects are [[Kan complex]]es and the right vertical morphism is a [[Kan fibration]]. 

1. has in the top left the correct [[derived hom-space]] in $C/X$ (since $a$ is cofibrant and $b$ fibrant).

This means that this correct hom-space $C/X(a,b) \simeq (C/X)^\circ(a,b) \in sSet$ is indeed a model for $C^\circ/X(a,b) \in \infty Grpd$.

## Quillen adjunctions between slice categories

+-- {: .num_prop #AdjunctionSliceCat}
###### Proposition

Given an adjunction $L\dashv R$ with $L\colon A\to B$ and $R\colon B\to A$,
the following compositions define two Quillen ajdunctions between associated slice categories.
If $X\in A$, then
$$L:A/X\leftrightarrows B/LX:R$$
is an adjunction,
where is the composition $R\colon B/LX\to A/RLX\to A/X$, the second arrow is the base change functor along the unit $X\to RLX$.
If $Y\in B$, then
$$L:A/RY\leftrightarrows B/Y:R$$
is an adjunction,
where $L\colon A/RY\to B/LRY\to B/Y$.
The first adjunction is a Quillen equivalence if $X$ is cofibrant and $LX$ is fibrant.
The second adjunction is a Quillen equivalence if $Y$ is fibrant.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

These adjunctions are Quillen adjunctions because their left (respectively right) adjoints
are left (respectively right) Quillen functors: in the model structures on
slice categories (co)fibrations and weak equivalences are created by the forgetful functor to~$A$ or~$B$,
see Hirschhorn's note ([Hirschhorn 05](#Hirschhorn05)).
An object in $A/X$ given by an arrow $Z\to X$ is cofibrant if and only if $Z$ is cofibrant and fibrant if and only if $Z\to X$ is a fibration.
Quillen's criterion for Quillen equivalences now yields the statements about equivalences.
