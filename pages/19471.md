## Definition

A subset $B$ of a [[vector space]] $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ is **balanced** if $\lambda x \in B$ whenever $x \in B$ and ${|\lambda|} \le 1$.

## Properties

The intersection of two balanced sets is balanced. The [[closure]] of a balanced set is again balanced.

## Examples

* The [[unit ball]] of a [[seminorm|seminormed]] space is balanced
* Any subspace is balanced
