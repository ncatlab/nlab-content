## Idea 

A [[topological space]] is _compactly generated_ if (in a certain sense) the continuous images in it of all [[compact Hausdorff space]]s tell you everything about its topology.

Compactly generated spaces form a [[convenient category of topological spaces]].


## Definitions 

A [[function]] $f\colon X \to Y$ between [[topological space]]s is __$k$-continuous__
if for all [[compact Hausdorff space]]s $C$ and [[continuous functions]] $t\colon C \to X$ the composite $f \circ t\colon C \to Y$ is continuous.
 
The following conditions on a space $X$ are equivalent:

1. For all spaces $Y$ and all functions $f\colon X \to Y$, $f$ is
continuous if and only if $f$ is $k$-continuous.
2. There is a [[set]] $S$ of compact Hausdorff spaces such that the previous condition holds for all $C \in S$.
3. $X$ is an [[identification space]] of a [[disjoint union]] of compact Hausdorff spaces.
4. A [[subspace]] $U \subseteq X$ is [[open subspace|open]] if and only if the [[preimage]] $t^{-1}(U)$ is open for any compact Hausdorff space $C$ and continuous $t\colon C \to X$.

A space $X$ is a __$k$-space__ if any (hence all) of the above conditions hold.  Some authors also say that a $k$-space is __compactly generated__, while others reserve that term for a $k$-space which is also _[[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]]_, meaning that the image of any $t\colon C\to X$ is closed (when $C$ is compact Hausdorff).  Some authors go on to require a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] space, but this seems to be unnecessary.

Sometimes $k$-spaces are called __Kelley spaces__, after [[John Kelley]], who studied them extensively; however, they predate him and the ‘$k$’ does not stand for his name.  (Probably it has something to do with 'compact' or 'kompakt'.)


## Examples
 {#Examples}

Examples of compactly generated spaces include

* every [[compact space]];

* every [[locally compact space]];

* every [[topological manifold]];

* every [[CW-complex]]; 

* every [[first countable space]] (since the topology is determined by convergent sequences = maps from one-point [[compactification]] $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$); these include all Fr&eacute;chet spaces. 


## Kaonization

Let $k\Top$ denote the category of $k$-spaces and continuous maps, and $\Top_k$ denote the category of all topological spaces and $k$-continuous maps.  We have inclusions
$$ k\Top \to \Top \to \Top_k $$
of which the first is the inclusion of a [[full subcategory|full]] [[coreflective subcategory]], the second is [[bijective on objects functor|bijective on objects]], and the composite $k\Top \to Top_k$ is an [[equivalence of categories]].

The [[coreflection]] $\Top \to k\Top$ is denoted $k$, and is sometimes (e.g. by [[M M Postnikov]]) also called **kaonization** and sometimes (e.g. by [[Peter May]]) **$k$-ification**.  This functor is constructed as follows: we take $k(X)=X$ as a set, but with the topology whose closed sets are those whose intersection with compact Hausdorff subsets of (the original topology on) $X$ is closed (in the original topology on $X$). Then $k(X)$ has all the same closed sets and possibly more, hence all the same open sets and possibly more.

In particular, the identity map $id:k(X)\to X$ is continuous, and forms the counit of the coreflection.  Thus this coreflection has a counit which is both [[monic]] and [[epic]], i.e. a "[[bimorphism]]"---such a coreflection is sometimes called a "bicoreflection."

Moreover, the identity $id: X \to k(X)$ is $k$-continuous, so that the counit becomes an isomorphism in $\Top_k$.  This shows that $k\Top \to \Top_k$ is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]], and it is fully faithful since any $k$-continuous function between $k$-spaces is $k$-continuous; hence it is an equivalence.

Since $k\Top \hookrightarrow \Top$ is coreflective, it follows that $k\Top$ is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]].  Its [[colimits]] are constructed as in $Top$, but its [[limits]] are the $k$-ification of limits in $Top$.  This is nontrivial already for [[products]]: the $k$-space product $X\times Y$ is the $k$-ification of the usual [[product topology]].  The $k$-space product is better behaved in many ways; e.g. it enables [[geometric realization]] to preserve products (and all finite limits), and the product of two [[CW complexes]] to be another CW complex.

If one is interested in $k$-spaces which are also [[weakly Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]], then there is a further [[reflector]] which must be applied; see [[weakly Hausdorff space]].


## Properties

### Cartesian closure

The categories $k\Top\simeq \Top_k$ are [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. (While in [[Top]] only some objects are exponentiable, see [[exponential law for spaces]].)  For arbitrary spaces $X$ and $Y$, define the *test-open* or *compact-open topology* on $\Top_k(X,Y)$ to have the [[subbase]] of sets $M(t,U)$, for a given compact Hausdorff space $C$, a map $t\colon C \to X$, and an open set $U$ in $Y$, where $M(t,U)$ consists of all $k$-continuous functions $f\colon X \to Y$ such that $f(t(C))\subseteq U$.

(This is slightly different from the usual [[compact-open topology]] if $X$ happens to have non-Hausdorff compact subspaces; in that case the usual definition includes such subspaces as tests, while the above definition excludes them.  Of course, if $X$ itself is Hausdorff, then the two become identical.)

With this topology, $\Top_k(X,Y)$ becomes an [[exponential object]] in $Top_k$.  It follows, by [[Yoneda lemma]] arguments, that the bijection
$$k\Top(X \times Y, Z) \to kTop(X,k\Top(Y,Z))$$
is actually an isomorphism in $\Top_k$, which we may call a *$k$-homeomorphism*.  In fact, it is actually a homeomorphism, i.e. an isomorphism already in $Top$.

+-- {: .query}
[[Zoran Škoda]]: I do not understand the remark. I mean if the domain is k-space then by the characterization above continuous is the same as k-continuous. Thus if both domain and codomain are continuous then homeo is the same as k-homeo. I assume that even in noHausdorff case, the test-open topology for $X$ and $Y$ k-spaces gives a k-space and that the cartesian product has the correction for the k-spaces. 

[[Todd Trimble]]: That may be just the point: that the domain is not necessarily a $k$-space. I have to admit that I haven't worked through the details of this exposition, but one thing I tripped over is the fact that we're dealing with _all_ topological spaces $X$, $Y$, not just $k$-spaces. 

[[Mike Shulman]]: But any topological space is isomorphic in $k\Top$ to its $k$-ification, right?  So $k\Top$ might as well be defined to consist of $k$-spaces and continuous maps. 

[[Todd Trimble]]: Okay, you're right that makes sense. So in that case, it seems that Zoran definitely has a point here.

[[Mike Shulman]]: See the [nForum discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1958).

It follows that the category $k\Top$ of $k$-spaces and continuous maps is also cartesian closed, since it is equivalent to $\Top_k$.  Its exponential object is the $k$-ification of the one constructed above for $\Top_k$.  Since for $k$-spaces, $k$-continuous implies continuous, the underlying set of this exponential space $k\Top(X,Y)$ is the set of all continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$.  Thus, when $X$ is Hausdorff, we can identify this space with the $k$-ification of the usual [[compact-open topology]] on $Top(X,Y)$.

Finally, this all remains true if we also impose the weak Hausdorff, or Hausdorff, conditions.


### Local cartesian closure 

Unfortunately neither of the above categories is [[locally
cartesian closed category|locally
cartesian closed]]. There is still a lot of work on fibred exponential
laws and their applications. One reason for the success and
difficulties is that it is easy to give a topology on the space of
closed subsets of a space $X$ by regarding this as the space of maps
to the [[Sierpinski space]] (the set $\{0,1\}$ of [[truth value]]s in which $\{1\}$
is closed but not open). From this one can get an [[exponential law for
spaces]] over $B$ if $B$ is $T_0$, so that all fibres of spaces over
$B$ are closed in their total space.  Note that weak Hausdorff implies $T_0$.

+-- {: .query}
[[Mike Shulman]]: What precisely does "get an exponential law" mean?  Do you mean that $k Top/B$ is cartesian closed if $B$ is $T_0$?

_Toby_: Hopefully that is explained in the new article.

_Mike_: Which new article?  [[exponential law for spaces]]?  That page doesn't talk about fibered exponentials at all.

_Toby_: Seeing this later, I no longer know what article I meant.
