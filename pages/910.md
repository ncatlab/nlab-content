A [[topological space]] is _compactly generated_ if (in a certain sense) its compact subsets tell you everything about its topology.

Compactly generated spaces are a kind of [[nice topological space]].

# Definition #

A __compactly generated space__ is a [[topological space]] $X$ such that any subspace $A$ of $X$ is closed if and only if its intersection with every compact subspace $K$ of $X$ is closed in $K$.  Given $A$, it is enough to check for those $K$ which belong to a given open cover of $X$ by relatively compact sets.
