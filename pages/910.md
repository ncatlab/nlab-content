## Idea 

A [[topological space]] is _compactly generated_ if (in a certain sense) the continuous images in it of all [[compact Hausdorff space]]s tell you everything about its topology.

Compactly generated spaces form a [[convenient category of topological spaces]].

## Definitions 

A function $f:X\to Y$ between [[topological space]]s is __$k$-continuous__
if for all [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s $C$ and continuous functions $t: C \to X$ the composite $f \circ t:C \to Y$ is continuous.
 
The following conditions on a space $X$ are equivalent:

1. For all spaces $Y$ and all functions $f:X \to Y$, $f$ is
continuous if and only if $f$ is $k$-continuous.
1. There is a set $S$ of compact Hausdorff spaces such that the previous condition holds for all $C \in S$.
1. $X$ is an [[identification space]] of a [[disjoint union]] of compact Hausdorff spaces.
1. A subset $U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $t^{-1}(U)$ is open for any compact Hausdorff space $C$ and continuous $t:C\to X$.

A space $X$ is a __$k$-space__ if any (hence all) of the above conditions hold.  Some authors also say that a $k$-space is __compactly generated__, while others reserve that term for a $k$-space which is also _[[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]]_, meaning that the image of any $t:C\to X$ is closed (when $C$ is compact Hausdorff).

## Cartesian closure 

The category $k\Top$ of topological spaces and $k$-continuous maps is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. In fact the exponential map 
$$k\Top(X \times Y, Z) \to kTop(X,k\Top(Y,Z))$$
is a homeomorphism (not just a $k$-homeomorphism).

[[Zoran Å koda]]: I do not understand the remark. I mean if the domain is k-space then by the characterization above continuous is the same as k-continuous. Thus if both domain and codomain are continuous then homeo is the same as k-homeo. I assume that even in noHausdorff case, the test-open topology for $X$ and $Y$ k-spaces gives a k-space and that the cartesian product has the correction for the k-spaces. 

[[Todd Trimble]]: That may be just the point: that the domain is not necessarily a $k$-space. I have to admit that I haven't worked through the details of this exposition, but one thing I tripped over is the fact that we're dealing with _all_ topological spaces $X$, $Y$, not just $k$-spaces. 
=--

The topology on $k\Top(X,Y)$ that is used here is the test-open
topology, which has the [[subbase]] of sets $M(t,U)$ for a given $t: C
\to X$ and $U$ open in $Y$ of all $k$-continuous functions $f:X \to
Y$ such that $f(t(C))\subseteq U$.

It follows that the category of $k$-spaces and continuous maps is also cartesian closed.  This remains true if we also impose the weak Hausdorff condition.

## Kaonization

Let us consider for the moment only the categories $Haus$ of Hausdorff and $kHaus$ of Hausdorff k-spaces. Then the tautological inclusion $kHaus\subset Haus$ has a right adjoint $k$ sometimes (e.g. by [[M M Postnikov]]) also called **kaonization**. This functor is constructed as follows $k(X)=X$ as a set and $k(X)$ has as new closed sets those sets whose intersection with old compacts in $X$ is closed in old topology on $X$. Then $k(X)$ has all the same closed sets and possibly more, hence all the old open sets and possibly more. In particular, the identity map $id:k(X)\to X$ is continuous. The mapping spaces $kHaus(X,Y)=k(Top(X,Y))$ where $Top(X,Y)$ is the standard mapping space in the sense of compact-open topology. Similarly, the categorical product in $kHaus$ is the kaonification of the usual (Tyhonov) product. Then $kHaus$ is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. See G. Whitehead's _Elements of homotopy theory_, for more details.  

## Local cartesian closure 

Unfortunately neither of the above categories is [[locally
cartesian closed category|locally
cartesian closed]]. There is still a lot of work on fibred exponential
laws and their applications. One reason for the success and
difficulties is that it is easy to give a topology on the space of
closed subsets of a space $X$ by regarding this as the space of maps
to the [[Sierpinski space]] (the set $\{0,1\}$ of [[truth value]]s in which $\{1\}$
is closed but not open). From this one can get an [[exponential law for
spaces]] over $B$ if $B$ is $T_0$, so that all fibres of spaces over
$B$ are closed in their total space.  Note that weak Hausdorff implies $T_0$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: What precisely does "get an exponential law" mean?  Do you mean that $k Top/B$ is cartesian closed if $B$ is $T_0$?

_Toby_:  Hopefully that is explained in the new article.
