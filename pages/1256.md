Coherent logic is a fragment of [[first-order logic]] restricted to $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\top$, $\bot$, and $\exists$. Coherent logic can be interpreted in a [[coherent category]].

A good example of a coherent theory that is not [[algebraic theory|algebraic]] (in any of the usual senses, although it comes from algebra) is the theory of a [[local ring]]; a similar example is the theory of a [[discrete field]].
