GAGA refers to the paper *Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique* by [[Serre]], and in general to results relating complex [[algebraic geometry]] and complex analytic geometry. For example, often one can compute [[sheaf cohomology]] either in the algebraic category or in the analytic category, obtaining the same result. This can be useful because one has more tools in the analytic category, such as [[Dolbeault cohomology|Dolbeault resolutions]]. Typically GAGA-type theorems hold for proper (compact) varieties, but not for non-proper varieties.

See the AMS book on several complex variables (Taylor???) for a good introduction to the classical GAGA.

Toen and Vaquie proves something about when a complex variety is algebraizable, in terms of a finiteness condition (saturatedness) on an associated dg-categorie whose homotopy cat is the derived cat of perfect complexes on the variety. File: Toen web publ caca.pdf.

from arXiv Front: math.AG by Jack Hall
This paper generalizes the fundamental GAGA results of Serre cite{MR0082175}
in three ways---to the non-separated setting, to stacks, and to families. As an
application of these results, we show that analytic compactifications of
$\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ possessing modular interpretations are algebraizable.
