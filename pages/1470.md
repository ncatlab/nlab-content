An **algebraic stack** denotes either a [[Deligne-Mumford stack]] or a more general [[Artin stack]] in the traditional setup of [[algebraic space]]s: they are (Grothendieck) $1$-[[stack|stacks]] of groupoids on the [[etale topology|étale site]] satisfying additional representability conditions.  Namely, an algebraic stack $X$ is required to have an atlas $A\to X$ from an algebraic space (or in a stronger version a [[scheme]]) $A$; the morphisms of the cover are required to be

* surjective representable and étale (for a Deligne--Mumford stack);
* surjective representable and smooth (for an Artin stack).

Here we used the following definition.  A map $f:X\to Y$ of 1-stacks on the étale site is *representable* if for any scheme $S$ the [[fiber product]] $S\times_Y X$ is a stack associated to a scheme. Let $P$ be a property stable under composition and pullback. A representable map $f:X\to Y$ of stacks is said to have a property $P$ if for any scheme $S$ and a morphism of 1-stacks $S\to Y$ the pullback $S\times_Y X\to X$ has property $P$.  

Nowdays people talk about [[differentiable stacks]] and [[topological stack]]s, meaning analogues of Deligne--Mumford (DM) or Artin stacks defined in the setup of [[Diff|the category of manifolds]] or some [[convenient category of topological spaces]]. [[orbifold|Orbifolds]] are an example of an Artin stack. For orbifolds stabilizer groups are finite, while for Artin stacks in general they are [[algebraic group]]s. An important source of DM-stacks are moduli problems, resulting often in moduli stacks (or their derived versions). DM-stacks are introduced in
