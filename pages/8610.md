## Idea

_Galois cohomology_ is the [[group cohomology]] of [[Galois groups]] $G$. Specifically, for $G$ the Galois group of a [[field extension]] $L/K$, Galois cohomology refers to the group cohomology of $G$ with [[coefficients]] in a $G$-[[module]] naturally associated to $L$.

Galois cohomology is studied notably in the context of _[[algebraic number theory]]_.

## Properties

### In terms of cohesive homotopy type theory 
 {#InCohesiveHomotopyTypeTheory}

We make some comments on the formulation of Galois cohomology in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]].

As discussed at _[[Galois theory]]_, the [[absolute Galois group]] $G_{Galois}$ of a [[field]] $K$ is the [[fundamental group]] of the [[space]] $X \coloneqq Spec(K)$. Hence its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G_{Galois}$ is the [[fundamental groupoid]]

$$
  \Pi_1(X)  \simeq \mathbf{B}G_{Galois}
  \,.
$$ 

In [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] there exists the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]-construction 

$$
  X \colon Type \;\vdash \; \Pi(X) \colon Type
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by the discussion at _[[group cohomology]]_ in the section _[group cohomology - In terms of homotopy type theory](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group%20cohomology#InHomotopyTypeTheory)_

1. a $G_{Galois}$-[[module]] $A$ is a $\mathbf{B}G_{Galois}$-[[dependent type]];

1. the [[group cohomology]] is the [[dependent product]] over the [[function type]]

   $$
     \vdash \; \left( \prod_{x \colon \mathbf{B}G_{Galois}} \left( * \to A \right)\right) \colon Type
     \,.
   $$

Hence, generally in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]], for $X$ a [[type]] and 

$$
  x \colon \Pi(X) \;\vdash \; A(x) \colon Type
$$

a $\Pi(X)$-[[dependent type]], we can say that the corresponding _$\infty$-Galois cohomology_ is

$$
  \vdash \; \left( \prod_{x \colon \Pi(X)} \left( * \to A\right) \right)
  \colon Type
  \,.
$$

**Warning.** Currently there is not written down yet a [[model]] for [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] given by a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] over a [[site]] like the [[étale site]].

from arXiv Front: math.NT by David Harbater, Julia Hartmann, Daniel Krashen
This paper proves local-global principles for Galois cohomology groups over
function fields $F$ of curves that are defined over a complete discretely
valued field. We show in particular that such principles hold for $H^n(F,
Z/mZ(n-1))$, for all $n>1$. This is motivated by work of Kato and others, where
such principles were shown in related cases for $n=3$. Using our results in
combination with cohomological invariants, we obtain local-global principles
for torsors and related algebraic structures over $F$. Our arguments rely on
ideas from patching as well as the Bloch-Kato conjecture.
