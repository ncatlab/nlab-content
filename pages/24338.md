A historically important early manuscript draft.

This manuscript draft later transformed in 
[[Homotopy Limit Functors on Model Categories and Homotopical Categories]], adding [[Jeffrey H. Smith]] as a coauthor.

However, the draft serves as an original reference for the [[Kan recognition theorem]] (in §II.8) and the [[Kan transfer theorem]] (in §II.9),
as well as [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] (in Chapter II).

Furthermore, this draft originates the modern definition of a [[model category]] (in §I.1.2), modifying the original definition of closed model category by [[Quillen]] by replacing finite (co)limits with small (co)limits and requiring factorizations to be functorial.

The first mention of [[monoidal model categories]] (without the [[unit axiom]]) under this name is in Remark 55.10, with no definition given, but the preceding section discusses the [[pushout product]] axiom.

All this material did not make it to the book.
