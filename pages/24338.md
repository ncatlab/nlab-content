A historically important early manuscript draft.

* [[William G. Dwyer]], [[Philip S. Hirschhorn]], [[Daniel M. Kan]], [[Model Categories and More General Abstract Homotopy Theory]], [PDF](https://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/dhk.pdf)

This manuscript draft later transformed in 
[[Homotopy Limit Functors on Model Categories and Homotopical Categories]], adding [[Jeffrey H. Smith]] as a coauthor.

However, the draft serves as an original reference for the [[Kan recognition theorem]] (in §II.8) and the [[Kan transfer theorem]] (in §II.9),
as well as cofibrantly generated model categories (in Chapter II).
