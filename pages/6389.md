I'm a statistical-physics novice living and working in the general vicinity of Boston, Massachusetts.  I hang around the nLab to keep my intellectual curiosity engaged, and sometimes I contribute a bibliographic item or a copy-edit.

Evidence of my lack of education:

* [...about combinatorial games](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/11/combinatorialgame_categories.html#c029299)
* [...about generating functions and stuff types](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/06/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_60.html#c033601)
* [...about thermodynamics, chaos theory and probability](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/05/categorytheoretic_characteriza_1.html#c037874)

On the advice of [[John Baez]], I'm going to try writing a bit about [[universality]].  And having started a page on [[universality class|universality classes]], I now realise that I should get a few other topics going:

* [[c-theorem]]
* [[Reggeon field theory]]
* [[RSOS model]]
* [[ADE classification]]

[T]he study of the representation theory of the [[Virasoro algebra]] gives a way of classifying all possible [[CFT]]s and thereby universality classes in 2d. The breakthrough in this direction came following the seminal 1984 paper of Belavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov (BPZ) in which they showed that, for certain special rational values of $c \lt 1$, the [[CFT]] closes with only a finite number of representations of the Virasoro algebra, and, for, these cases, all the critical exponents and multi-point correlation functions are calculable. Shortly thereafter Friedan, Qiu and Shenker showed that unitary CFTs (corresponding to local, positive definite Boltzmann weights) are a subset of this list, with $c = 1 - 6/m(m + 1)$ and $m$ an integer $\geq 3$. This gives rise to what might be termed the 'conformal periodic table'. The first few examples may be identified with well-known universality classes. The 'hydrogen atom' of CFT is the scaling limit of the critical Ising model, 'helium' is the tricritical Ising model, and so on. Note, however, that at the next value of $c = 4$ two possible 'isotopes' arise. In the second, corresponding to the critical 3-state Potts model, not all the scaling dimensions allowed by BPZ in fact occur, but some of those that do actually appear twice. In fact the constraint of unitarity is not sufficient to determine exactly which representations actually occur in a given CFT. The answer to this is provided by demanding consistency of the theory on a torus, by interchanging the interpretations of space and imaginary time [...]. For the torus, this is a modular transformation, and the requirement of modular invariance has become another powerful tool in classifying CFTs, completely solved in the case $c \lt 1$ by Cappelli, Itzykson and Zuber.

**Restricted Solid-on-Solid** or **RSOS models** are field theories defined on a lattice, in which the field values at adjacent lattice sites are energetically constrained in a way specified by a graph structure.  If the graph is one of the special $A$, $D$ or $E$ Dynkin diagrams, then the critical point of the model is governed by a conformal field theory whose central charge is fixed by the Coxeter number of that Dynkin diagram.  RSOS models therefore exemplify the possible universality classes of 2D systems in thermal equilibrium.

$$ Z = \sum_{heights} \prod_{faces} W \left(\begin{array}{cc} d & c \\ a & b\end{array}\right). $$

The Boltzmann weights, as defined by Pasquier, depend on the _crossing parameter_ $\lambda = \pi/\hat{h}$, where $\hat{h}$ is the Coxeter number of the Dynkin diagram, and the _spectral parameter_ $u \in (0, \lambda)$.

$$ W \left(\begin{array}{cc} d & c \\ a & b\end{array}\mid u\right) = \frac{\sin\lambda - u}{\sin\lambda} \delta_{a, c} G_{a, b} G_{a, d} + \frac{\sin u}{\sin\lambda} \left(\frac{S_a S_c}{S_b S_d}\right)^{1/2} \delta_{b, d} G_{a, b} G_{b, c}. $$

$G_{a, b}$ is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
