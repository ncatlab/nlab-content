I'm a statistical-physics novice living and working in the general vicinity of Boston, Massachusetts.  I hang around the nLab to keep my intellectual curiosity engaged, and sometimes I contribute a bibliographic item or a copy-edit.

Evidence of my lack of education:

* [...about combinatorial games](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/11/combinatorialgame_categories.html#c029299)
* [...about generating functions and stuff types](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/06/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_60.html#c033601)
* [...about thermodynamics, chaos theory and probability](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/05/categorytheoretic_characteriza_1.html#c037874)

On the advice of [[John Baez]], I'm going to try writing a bit about [[universality]].  And having started a page on [[universality class|universality classes]], I now realise that I should get a few other topics going:

* [[c-theorem]]
* [[Reggeon field theory]]
* [[RSOS model]]
* [[ADE classification]]
