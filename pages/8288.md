## Idea

In the context of [[homological algebra]] a _projective/injective_ [[resolution]] of an [[object]] or [[chain complex]] in an [[abelian category]] is a [[resolution]] by a [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] chain complex that consists of [[projective objects]] or [[injective objects]], respectively.

Under suitable conditions these are precisely the [[cofibrant resolution]] or [[fibrant resolution]] with respect to a standard [[model structure on chain complexes]].

For instance for non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups there is a model structure with [[weak equivalences]] are the quasi-isomorphisms and the [[fibrations]] are the positive-degreewise surjections. Here every object is a [[fibrant object]] and hence no [[fibrant resolution]] is necessary; while the [[cofibrant resolutions]] are precisely the projective resolutions.

Dually, for non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups there is a model structure with [[weak equivalences]] are the quasi-isomorphisms and the [[cofibrations]] the positive-degreewise injections. Here every object is a [[cofibrant object]] and hence no [[cofibrant resolution]] is necessary; while the [[fibrant resolutions]] are precisely the projective resolutions.

## Definition

We first discuss, as is traditional, projective/injective resolutions of single objects, and then the general cases of projective/injective resolutions of chain complexes. This subsumes the previous case by regarding an object as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0.

### Resolution of an object

+-- {: .num_defn #InjectiveResolution}
###### Definition

For $X \in \mathcal{A}$ an [[object]], an **injective resolution** of $X$ is a [[cochain complex]] $J^\bullet \in Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ (in non-negative degree) equipped with a [[quasi-isomorphism]]

$$
  i : X \stackrel{\sim}{\to} J^\bullet
$$

such that $J^n \in \mathcal{A}$ is an [[injective object]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

+-- {: .num_remark #InjectiveResolutionInComponents}
###### Remark

In components the quasi-isomorphism of def. \ref{InjectiveResolution}
is a [[chain map]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots

    J^n &\stackrel{d^n}{\to}&\cdots 
  }
  \,.
$$

Since the top complex is concentrated in degree 0, this being a [[quasi-isomorphism]] happens to be equivalent to the sequence

$$
  0 \to X \stackrel{i^0}{\to} J^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} J^1 \stackrel{d^1}{\to}

### Resolution of a complex

## Properties

### Existence and construction
 {#ExistenceAndConstruction}

We first discuss the existence of injective/projective resolutions, and then the [[functor|functoriality]] of their constructions.

+-- {: .num_prop #ExistenceOfInjectiveResolutions}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] with [[injective object|enough injectives]] (such as $R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$).

Then every object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ has an [[injective resolution]], 
def. \ref{InjectiveResolution}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $X \in \mathcal{A}$ be the given object. 
By remark \ref{InjectiveResolutionInComponents} we need to 
construct an [[exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  0 \to X \to J^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} J^1 \stackrel{d^1}{\to}
  J^2 \stackrel{d^2}{\to} \cdots \to J^n \to \cdots 
$$

such that all the $J^\cdot$ are [[injective objects]].

This we now construct by [[induction]] on the degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In the first step, by the assumption of enough enjectives we find an injective object $J^0$ and a [[monomorphism]]

$$
  X \hookrightarrow J^0
$$

hence an [[exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X \to J^0
  \,.
$$

Assume then by induction hypothesis that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an [[exact sequence]]

$$
  X \to J^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} \cdots \to J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n
$$

has been constructed, where all the $J^\cdot$ are injective objects. Froming the [[cokernel]] of $d^{n-1}$ yields the [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n \stackrel{p}{\to} J^n/J^{n-1} \to 0
  \,.
$$

By the assumption that there are enough injectives in $\mathcal{A}$ we may now again find a monomorphism $J^n/J^{n-1} \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} J^{n+1}$ into an injective object $J^{n+1}$. This being a monomorphism means that 

$$
  J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n \stackrel{d^n \coloneqq i \circ p}{\longrightarrow} J^{n+1}
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]] in the middle term. Therefore we now have an [[exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X \to J^0 \to \cdots \to J^{n-1} \stackrel{d^{n-1}}{\to} J^n \stackrel{d^{n}}{\to} J^{n+1}
$$

which completes the [[induction]] step.

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] with [[projective object|enough projectives]] (such as $R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$).

###### Proof

Let $X \in \mathcal{A}$ be the given object. 
By remark \ref{ProjectiveResolutionInComponents} we need to

  J_2 \stackrel{\partial_1}{\to}
  J_1 \stackrel{\partial_0}{\to}
  J_0 \to X \to 0
$$

such that all the $J_\cdot$ are [[projective objects]]. 

This we we now construct by [[induction]] on the degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In the first step, by the assumption of enough projectives we find a projective object $J_0$ and an [[epimorphism]]

$$
  J_0 \to X
$$

hence an [[exact sequence]]

$$
  J_0 \to X \to 0
  \,.
$$

Assume then by induction hypothesis that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an [[exact sequence]]

$$
  J_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to}
  J_{n-1}
  \to 
  \cdots
  \stackrel{\partial_0}{\to}
  J_0
  \to 
  X
  \to 
  0
$$

has been constructed, where all the $J_\cdot$ are projective objects. Froming the [[kernel]] of $\partial_{n-1}$ yields the [[short exact sequence]]

  \stackrel{i}{\to}
   J_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to}
  J_{n-1}

  \,.
$$

By the assumption that there are enough projectives in $\mathcal{A}$ we may now again find an epimorphism 
$ p : J_{n+1} \to ker(\partial_{n-1})$ out of a projective object $J_{n+1}$. This being an epimorphism means that 

$$
  J_{n+1} \stackrel{\partial_{n} \coloneqq i\circ p}{\to}
  J_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to}
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]] in the middle term. Therefore we now have an [[exact sequence]]

    \stackrel{\partial_n}{\to}
  J_n
    \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to}
  \cdots
   \stackrel{\partial_0}{\to}
  J_0
  \to 
  X
  \to 
  0
  \,,
$$

which completes the [[induction]] step.

+-- {: .num_lemma #MapsOutOfExactIntoInjectiveAreNullHomotopic}
###### Lemma

Let $f^\bullet : X^\bullet \to J^\bullet$ be a [[chain map]] out of an [[exact sequence|exact complex]] $0 \simeq_{qi} X^\bullet$ to a degreewise injective complex $J^\bullet$. Then there is a [[chain homotopy]] 

$$
  \eta : 0 \Rightarrow f^\bullet
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of [[chain homotopy]] we need to construct a sequence of morphisms $(\eta^n : X^{n+1} \to J^{n})_{n \geq 1\in \mathbb{N}}$ such that 

$$
  f^n = \eta^{n+1} \circ d^n_X + d^{n-1} \circ \eta^n
  \,.
$$

for all $n$. We now construct this by [[induction]] over $n$, where we take $\eta^0 \coloneqq 0$.

Then in the induction step assume that for given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have constructed $\eta^{\bullet \leq n}$ satisfying the above conditions. 

First define now 

$$
  g^n \coloneqq f^n - d_J^{n-1} \circ \eta^n
$$

and observe that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g^n \circ d_X^{n-1} 
    & =
    f^n \circ d^{n-1}_X - d^{n-1}_J \circ \eta^n \circ d^{n-1}_X
    \\
    & = f^n \circ d^{n-1}_X - d^{n-1}_J \circ f^{n-1} 
        + d^{n-1}_J \circ d^{n-2}_J \circ \eta^{n-1}
    \\
    & = 0 + 0
    \\
    & 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This means that the [[image]] of $g^n$ is $X^n / im(d^{n-1}_X) \hookrightarrow J^n$. 

Observe then that by exactness of $X^\bullet$ the morphism
$X^n / im(d^{n-1}_X) \stackrel{d^n_X}{\to} X^{n+1}$ is a [[monomorphism]]. Together this gives us a diagram of the form


$$
  \array{
    X^n / im(d^{n-1}_X) &\stackrel{d^n_X}{\to}& X^{n+1}
   \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g^n}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\eta^{n+1}}}
    \\
    J^n   }
  \,,
$$ 


where the morphism $\eta^{n+1}$ may be found due to the defining [[right lifting property]] of the [[injective object]] $J^n$ against the top monomorphism.

Observing that the [[commuting diagram|commutativity]] of this diagram is the chain homotopy condition involving $\eta^n$ and $\eta^{n+1}$, this completes the induction step.

The following proposition says that when injectively resolving objects the morphisms between these objects lift to the resolutions, uniquely up to chain homotopy.

+-- {: .num_prop #InjectiveResolutionOfCodomainRespectsMorphisms}
###### Proposition

Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{A}$. Let

$$
  i_Y : Y \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Y^\bullet
$$

be an injective resolution of $Y$ and 

$$
  i_X : X \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X^\bullet
$$

any [[monomorphism|monomorphism]] that is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] (possibly but not necessarily an injective resolution). Then there is a [[chain map]] $f^\bullet : X^\bullet \to Y^\bullet$ giving a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{\sim}{\to}& X^\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^\bullet}}
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{\sim}{\to}& Y^\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of [[chain map]] we need to construct
[[morphisms]] $(f^n : X^0 \to Y^0)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that 
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
    X^{n} &\stackrel{d^n_X}{\to}& X^{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y^{n} &\stackrel{d^n_Y}{\to}& Y^{n+1}
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commute]] (the defining condition on a [[chain map]]) and such that the diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i_X}{\to}& X^0
    \\
    \downarrow^{f} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^0}}
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{i_Y}{\to}& Y^0
  }
$$

commutes in $\mathcal{A}$ (which makes the full diagram in $Ch^\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ commute).

We construct these $f^\bullet = (f^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ by [[induction]].


To start the induction, the morphism $f^0$ in the first diagram above can be found by the defining [[right lifting property]] of the [[injective object]] $Y^0$ against the [[monomorphism]] $i_X$.

Assume then that for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ component maps $f^{\bullet \leq n}$ have been obtained such that $d^k_Y\circ f^k = f^{k+1}\circ d^k_X$ for all $0 \leq k \lt n$ . In order to construct $f^{n+1}$ consider the following diagram, which we will describe/construct stepwise from left to right:

$$
  \array{
    X^n &\stackrel{}{\to}& X^n/im(d^{n-1}_X) &\stackrel{d^n_X}{\hookrightarrow}& X^{n+1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f^n}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g^n}}
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h^n}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{f^{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y^n &\underset{d^n_Y}{\to}& Y^{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the morphism $f^n$ on the left is given by induction assumption and we define the diagonal morphism to be the composite

$$
 g^n \coloneqq d^n_Y \circ f^n
 \,.
$$

Observe then that by the chain map property of the $f^{\bullet \leq n}$ we have

$$
  d^n_Y \circ f^n \circ d^{n-1}_X = d^n_Y \circ d^{n-1}_Y \circ f^{n-1} = 0
$$

and therefore $g^n$ factors through $X^n/im(d^{n-1}_X)$ via some $h^n$ as indicated in the middle of the above diagram. Finally the morphism on the top right is a monomorphism by the fact that $X^{\bullet}$ is [[exact sequence|exact]] in positive degrees (being [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to a complex concentrated in degree 0) and so a lift $f^{n+1}$ as shown on the far right of the diagram exists by the defining lifting property of the injective object $Y^{n+1}$. 

The total outer diagram now commutes, being built from commuting sub-diagrams, and this is the required chain map property of $f^{\bullet \leq n+1}$ This completes the induction step.

### Relation to syzygies

### Relation to axioms of choice 

For ordinary [[modules]] $M$ over a [[ring]] $R$, a standard way of constructing a projective resolution of $M$ is to construct a 
[[projective cover]] $\pi_1 \colon P_1 \to M$ by, for example, taking $P_1$ to be the [[free module]] $F U(M)$ generated by the underlying set of $M$ and $\pi_1$ the counit $F U(M) \to M$ of the [[free-forgetful adjunction]] evaluated at $M$. Then iterate this process where $K_n$ is the kernel of $\pi_n$ and $\pi_{n+1} \colon P_{n+1} \to K_n$ is a projective cover. 

A slightly subtle point is that there is no guarantee that the free module $F U(M)$ is actually projective, unless one assumes some form of the [[axiom of choice]]. Since the axiom of choice is not available in all [[toposes]], one cannot use this procedure in general to construct, say, projective resolutions in the abelian category $Ab(E)$ of abelian [[group objects]] in a general [[Grothendieck topos]] $E$ (even though one can construct free resolutions), such as needed in general in [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]. 

There are however weak forms of the axiom of choice that hold in many toposes, such as the [[presentation axiom]], aka _COSHEP_. We have the following result: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
Let $E$ be a [[W-pretopos]] that satisfies [[COSHEP]]. Then projective resolutions exist for any object of $Ab(E)$. 

=-- 

The idea of proof is that the underlying object of an abelian group $A$ in $E$ admits a [[projective cover]] $X \to U(A)$ in $E$, and then the corresponding $F(X) \to A$ is a projective cover in $Ab(E)$.
