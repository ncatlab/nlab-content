## Idea

In the context of [[homological algebra]] a _projective/injective_ [[resolution]] of an [[object]] or [[chain complex]] in an [[abelian category]] is a [[resolution]] by a [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] chain complex that consists of [[projective objects]] or [[injective objects]], respectively.

Under suitable conditions these are precisely the [[cofibrant resolution]] or [[fibrant resolution]] with respect to a standard [[model structure on chain complexes]].

For instance for non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups there is a model structure with [[weak equivalences]] are the quasi-isomorphisms and the [[fibrations]] are the positive-degreewise surjections. Here every object is a [[fibrant object]] and hence no [[fibrant resolution]] is necessary; while the [[cofibrant resolutions]] are precisely the projective resolutions.

Dually, for non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups there is a model structure with [[weak equivalences]] are the quasi-isomorphisms and the [[cofibrations]] the positive-degreewise injections. Here every object is a [[cofibrant object]] and hence no [[cofibrant resolution]] is necessary; while the [[fibrant resolutions]] are precisely the projective resolutions.

### Relation to axioms of choice 

For ordinary [[modules]] $M$ over a [[ring]] $R$, a standard way of constructing a projective resolution of $M$ is to construct a 
[[projective cover]] $\pi_1 \colon P_1 \to M$ by, for example, taking $P_1$ to be the [[free module]] $F U(M)$ generated by the underlying set of $M$ and $\pi_1$ the counit $F U(M) \to M$ of the [[free-forgetful adjunction]] evaluated at $M$. Then iterate this process where $K_n$ is the kernel of $\pi_n$ and $\pi_{n+1} \colon P_{n+1} \to K_n$ is a projective cover. 

A slightly subtle point is that there is no guarantee that the free module $F U(M)$ is actually projective, unless one assumes some form of the [[axiom of choice]]. Since the axiom of choice is not available in all [[toposes]], one cannot use this procedure in general to construct, say, projective resolutions in the abelian category $Ab(E)$ of abelian [[group objects]] in a general [[Grothendieck topos]] $E$ (even though one can construct free resolutions), such as needed in general in [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]. 

There are however weak forms of the axiom of choice that hold in many toposes, such as the [[presentation axiom]], aka _COSHEP_. We have the following result:

###### Proposition 
Let $E$ be a [[W-pretopos]] that satisfies [[COSHEP]]. Then projective resolutions exist for any object of $Ab(E)$.

The idea of proof is that the underlying object of an abelian group $A$ in $E$ admits a [[projective cover]] $X \to U(A)$ in $E$, and then the corresponding $F(X) \to A$ is a projective cover in $Ab(E)$.
