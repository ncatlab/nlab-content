## Idea

There are two different theorems of the same intuitive spirit so they are commonly called the **Serre-Swan theorem**:

1) **Serre's theorem**: let $R$ be a commmutative unital [[Noetherian ring]] (in particular, the coordinate ring of an [[affine variety]] over a [[field]]), then the [[category]] of finitely-generated <em>projective</em> $R$-[[module]]s is equivalent to the category of [[algebraic vector bundle]]s (= locally free [[sheaf|sheaves]] of $O$-[[module]]s of constant finite rank) on $Spec R$.

2) **Swan's theorem**: Given a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[compact space]] $X$, the category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective modules]] over the [[function algebra]] $C(X)$ is equivalent to the category of finite-[[rank]] [[vector bundles]] on $X$, where the equivalence is established by sending a vector bundle to the its module of continuous [[sections]].

These theorems are important as they help extending the [[topological K-theory]] as a special cases of [[algebraic K-theory]], as well as to motivate an approach to vector bundles in [[noncommutative geometry]].
