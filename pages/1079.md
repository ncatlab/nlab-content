In algebra, a __direct product__ is simply a [[product]] in a [[concrete category]] that is created by the [[forgetful functor]].

Compare the [[direct sum]], a more complicated concept.

# Examples #

Trivially, a [[cartesian product]] of [[set]]s is a direct product in [[Set]].

One of the requirements of a [[topological category]] is that any family of objects must have a direct product, although the term 'direct product' is not used in topology.

Many [[algebraic category|algebraic categories]], such as [[Grp]], [[Ab]], [[Ring]], etc, also have all direct products; this is where the term 'direct product' originated.

The category of ($Set$-valued) models of any [[Lawvere theory]] has all direct products; this includes the examples from algebra above.
