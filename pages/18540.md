## Idea

In the $G$-[[equivariant]] context for a finite group $G$, the role of abelian groups in non-equivariant algebra is now taken by [[Mackey functors]]. The category of Mackey functors is a closed [[symmetric monoidal category]] with symmetric monoidal product, the box product. **Green functors** are commutative monoids for this box product.

A [[Green functor]] is a [[Mackey functor]] $\underline{R}$ such that for all finite $G$-sets $T$, $\underline{R}(T)$ is commutative ring, such that all restriction maps are maps of commutative rings, and such that if $f: T\to T'$ is a map of finite $G$-sets, then we have the [[Frobenius reciprocity]] relation 

$$
a \cdot T_f(b) = T_f(R_f(a) \cdot b)
$$

for all $a \in \underline{R}(T')$ and $b \in \underline{R}(T)$.
