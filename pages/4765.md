## Idea 

For each of various classical types of [[algebras]], like [[associative algebra|associative]], [[Lie algebra|Lie]], [[Liebniz algebra|Leibniz]], [[commutative algebra|commutative]] and so on, one can form a version where the required identities hold only up to [[homotopy]]. The most important modification is that the required identities hold up to *coherent* homotopy; such were traditionally called _strong homotopy algebras_. If $P$ is an [[operad]] in some homotopical context then to obtain the homotopy generalization of $P$-[[algebra of an operad|algebras]], one needs to [[resolution|resolve]] the operad $P$ to an appropropriate replacement $P_\infty$ which is minimal or cofibrant in certain sense. 


## Terminology in the case of dg-operads

The classical case is in the setup of a [[dg-operad]]. 
Thus one had __strong homotopy associative__ algebras which are the same as $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebras]], __strong homotopy commutative__ (associative) algebras which also called $C_\infty$-[[C-infinity-algebra|algebras]], __strong homotopy bialgebras__ or $B_\infty$-[[B-infinity algebra|algebras]], __strong homotopy Gerstenhaber__ or $G_\infty$-[[G-infinity-algebra|algebras]] and __strong homotopy Lie algebras__ or $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebras]] and (strong) [[homotopy BV-algebra]]s or $BV_\infty$-[[BV-infinity-algebra|algebras]].
