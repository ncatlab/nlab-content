## Idea

A temporal algebra is a [[modal algebra]] with two operations that reflect the future and past modal operators of a [[temporal logic]].


## Definitions

###### Definition

A **temporal algebra** is a [[Boolean algebra]], $(\mathbb{B}, m_0,m_1)$, with operators, of type $2$,
with the condition that the operators are _conjugate_:

$m_0 x \cdot y = 0$ if, and only if, $m_1 y \cdot x = 0$.

Equivalently (and equationally) this can be written as 

$x \leq l_0 m_1 x \cdot l_1 m_0 x$

where $l_i$ is the [[de Morgan duality|dual]] of $m_1$.
