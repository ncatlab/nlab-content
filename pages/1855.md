Given an $A$-[[coring]] or even a more general additive [[comonad]] with a [[grouplike element]] there are several related (but in general nonequivalent) notions of connections.

As explained in [[grouplike element]], to an $A$-coring $C$ with a grouplike elements one associates a [[semi-free differential graded algebra]] $\Omega A = \Omega(A,C)$, sometimes called its (generalized) Amitsur complex. The simplest notion of a connection for the coring $C$ is a [[connection for a differential graded algebra|connection]] for the corresponding Amitsur complex. 

Let now $A$ be a $k$-algebra and $(C,\Delta,\epsilon)$ be an $A$-coring with grouplike element $g$ and $(\Omega A,d)$ its [[Amitsur complex]]. A connection $\nabla:M\otimes+A\Omega^\bullet\to M\otimes_A\Omega^{\bullet+1}$ on a module $M$ over a [[semifree dga]] is determined by its value $\nabla_M|_M$ on $M\cong M\otimes_A A$. If $\rho^M:M\to M\otimes_A C$ is a right $C$-coaction then the formula $\nabla|_M:m\mapsto \rho^M(m)-m\otimes g$ actually determines a flat connection on $M$. Conversely, a flat connection determines a right $C$-coaction by $\rho^M(m)=\nabla(m)+m\otimes g$. This amounts to a bijection between $C$-coactions and flat connection on $M$. Regarding that coactions correspond to descent data in the context of comonadic descent, this gives the flat connection interpretation of such descent data. A first instance is probably Grothendieck's identification of flat connections and the first order costratifications in Grothendieck's theory of differential calculus on schemes (foundations of [[crystalline cohomology]], see book by Berthelot and Ogus).
