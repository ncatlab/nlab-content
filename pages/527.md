This is an experiment in collaboration. I want to write an article about discrete causal spaces. Please help. Coauthors welcome! - [[Eric Forgy|Eric]]

#Goals#

1. Construct a generalization of [[ericforgy:Discrete differential geometry on causal graphs|Discrete differential geometry on causal graphs]] to $n$-dimensional discrete causal spaces that are _locally_ like $n$-diamonds (see the paper for a description of $n$-diamonds until a page is created).
1. The continuum limit of a discrete causal space should be a [[directed space]], or more specifically, a [[smooth Lorentzian space]].
1. Etc

(From nCafe: <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html#c021347">Authorship</a>)

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: I think Eric wants a [[partial order|poset]] of sorts.

It seems that a good formalization of “[[smooth Lorentzian space|smooth Lorentzian space(time)]]” is something like: a [[partial order|poset]] [[internal category|internal]] to a category of measure spaces.

There are some immediate possibilities about graph versions of this statement that come to mind. For one, a discrete “Lorentzian spacetime” should be a poset such that all causal subsets are finite set.

A [[causet|causal subset]] in a poset $X$ is what John in his latest <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/hopf_algebras_from_posets.html">entry</a> calls an “interval”, namely for two objects $x,y$ in the poset the [[under category|under-over category]]

$$x\darr X\darr y$$

of all objects in the past of $x$ and in the future of $y$.


_[[Tim Porter|Tim]]_: In a poset one can define a diamond as being an order convex subset possibly with extra properties: U is order convex if $x$, $z$ are in $U$ with $x \lt z$, and $y$ lies between $x$ and $z$ ($x\lt y \lt z$). 

One possible interpretation of what Eric wants is that one specifies a collection of order convex subsets with inclusion on them making a directed set or possibly a lattice. (sort of needing to capture that diamonds should intersect in diamonds  (or not at all). Something like this is used by John Roberts in some of his work I seem to remember. 

 Reminder ('cos I thought this had been mentioned in the café) it may also pay to look at gr-qc/0410104 for some ideas but I never convinced myself that that was really what was needed.
