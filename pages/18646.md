## Idea

In the construction of [[quantum field theory]] various naive mathematical constructions give rise to ill-defined "[[divergent series|divergent]]" expressions. 

Some of these occur in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that [[interaction]] point are taken _close_ to each other. Since the short distances involved in this limit translates, under [[Fourier transform]], to high [[frequencies]] enoded in the [[wave front set]] of the [[distributions]]; these are called _ultraviolet divergences_. The correct way to deal with them is called _[[renormalization]]_.

Other divergences occcur in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that the spacetime [[support]] of the [[interaction]] (the support of the "[[adiabatic switching]]") tends without bounds to all of spacetime, also called the [[adiabatic limit]]. Since this large distance involved in this limit translate, under [[Fourier transform]] to low [[frequencies]], these are called _[[infrared divergences]]_.
