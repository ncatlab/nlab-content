## Idea

Cantor\'s Paradox is a [[paradox]] of naïve [[set theory]] based on an observation of [[Bertrand Russell]] that is similar to, but predates, [[Russell's Paradox]].  Like Russell\'s Paradox, it is essentially about [[diagonalization|diagonalisation]] and [[Cantor's Theorem]].


## Argument

Assume a [[set]] $V$ of all [[sets]], and consider the [[power set]] $\mathcal{P}V$.  Since every element of $\mathcal{P}V$ is a set, $\mathcal{P}V$ is a [[subset]] of $V$.  In particular, we have an [[injection]] $\mathcal{P}V \hookrightarrow V$, which contradicts the conclusion of [[Cantor's Theorem]].


## History

Cantor\'s Paradox may be credited to [[Georg Cantor]], because he considered its implications before Russell did; however, he did not view it as a [[paradox]], but merely a demonstration that the collection of all sets was an 'inconsistent multiplicity'.  (That is also the usual modern view, if we interpret Cantor\'s inconsistent multiplicities as [[proper classes]].)

The argument above is a little opaque, because it relies on Cantor\'s Theorem, which must be proved as well to complete the argument.  However, if one applies the ([[constructive mathematics|constructive]]!) proof of Cantor\'s Theorem to Cantor\'s Paradox and evaluates all of the definitions involved, then one ends up with the set $\{x \;|\; x \notin x\}$ of [[Russell's Paradox]]; this is precisely what Russell himself did to develop his paradox.  That paradox is now the usual go-to paradox to demonstrate the [[inconsistency]] of naïve set theory, especially [[material set theory]].
