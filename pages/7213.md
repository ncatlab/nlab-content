## Idea

A variant of the idea of [[generalized complex geometry]], which instead of the inclusion $O(d)\times O(d) \to O(d,d)$ is controled by incusions into [[split real forms]] of [[exceptional Lie groups]] such as 
$SU(8)/\mathbb{Z}_2 \to E_{7(7)}$. This serves to neatly encode [[U-duality]] groups in [[supergravity]].
