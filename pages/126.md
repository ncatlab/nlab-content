## Definition

Given a [[category]] $C$, a __subcategory__ $D$ consists of a subcollection of the collection of [[object|objects]] of $C$ and a subcollection of the collection of [[morphism|morphisms]] of $D$ such that:

* If the morphism $f : x \to y$ is in $D$, then so are $x$ and $y$.

* If $f : x \to y$ and $g : y \to z$ are in $D$, then so is the [[composition|composite]] $g f : x \to z$.  

* If $x$ is in $D$ then so is the [[identity morphism]] $1_x$.

These conditions ensure that $D$ is a category in its own right and the inclusion $D\hookrightarrow C$ is a [[functor]].  Additionally, we say that $D$ is...

* A __[[full subcategory]]__ if for any $x$ and $y$ in $D$, every morphism $f : x \to y$ in $C$ is also in $D$ (that is, the inclusion [[functor]] $D\hookrightarrow C$ is [[full functor|full]]).

* A __[[replete subcategory]]__ if for any $x$ in $D$ and any isomorphism $f:x\cong y$ in $C$, both $y$ and $f$ are also in $D$.

* A __[[wide subcategory]]__ if every object of $C$ is also an object of $D$.


## Non-evil variants

Just as subsets of a [[set]] $X$ can be identified with isomorphism classes of [[monomorphism|monic]] functions into $X$, subcategories of a category $C$ can be identified with isomorphism classes of monic _functors_ into $C$.  A functor is easily verified to be monic iff it is [[faithful functor|faithful]] and injective on objects.  This can be generalized to monomorphisms in a [[strict 2-category]].

However, this notion is [[evil]] since being injective-on-objects refers to equality of objects.  This raises the question: what is a good non-evil definition of **subobject** in a [[2-category]]?  It is the contention of the authors of this page that there are multiple such definitions.  Two evident ones are:

* A morphism $f: A\to B$ in a 2-category $K$ is **1-monic** if it is full and faithful, i.e. $K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$ is full and faithful for all $X$.  A **1-subobject** of $B$ is an [[equivalence]] class of 1-monomorphisms into $B$, and a **1-subcategory** is a 1-subobject in $Cat$.
* Likewise, $f$ is **2-monic** if $K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$ is faithful for all $X$.  A **2-subobject** of $B$ is an equivalence class of 2-monomorphisms into $B$, and a **2-subcategory** is a 2-subobject in $Cat$.

The obvious generalizations (at least, obvious once you start thinking in terms of $k$-[[k-surjective functor|surjectivity]]) are that every morphism is 3-monic, while the 0-monic morphisms are the equivalences.  (Note that this numbering is offset by one from that used in [Baez and Shulman](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420).)  There is likewise an evident generalization to $k$-monomorphisms in any $n$-[[n-category|category]].

It is fairly undisputed that 1-subobjects, as defined above, are a good notion of subobject in a 2-category.  In particular, any full and faithful functor $C\to D$ in $Cat$ is equivalent to the inclusion of a full subcategory $C'\to D$ (here $C'$ is the full image of $C$).  Also, in a 1-category considered as a locally discrete 2-category, the 1-monomorphisms are precisely the usual sort of [[monomorphism]].

In fact, any faithful functor is likewise equivalent to the inclusion of a (non-full) subcategory, but in this case the codomain must be modified as well as the domain.  It is somewhat more disputable whether 2-subcategories all deserve to be called "subcategories;" for instance, is [[Grp]] a "subcategory" of [[Set]]?  Note also that any functor between [[discrete category|discrete categories]] is faithful, so that the [[terminal category]] has a proper class of inequivalent 2-subcategories, and similarly every morphism in a locally discrete 2-category is 2-monic.  However, kernels of morphisms between 2-groups are 2-subobjects, not 1-subobjects, and likewise for any subgroup of a [[group]] (considered as a 1-object category).  This motivates the term "2-subobject," to make it clear that there is some relationship with the sort of subobjects we are used to in 1-categories, but also some notable generalization.

Other types of morphism in a 2-category which have some claim to be considered "subobjects" include [[pseudomonic functor|pseudomonic]] morphisms and [[conservative functor|conservative]] morphisms.  Pseudomonic morphisms might merit a name such as **(2,1)-subcategory**, since a functor is pseudomonic iff it is faithful (a 2-subcategory) and its induced functor between [[underlying groupoid]]s is fully faithful (a 1-subcategory).
