## Idea

Given a point in [[Minkowski spacetime]], its _light cone_ is the subspace of all [[lightlike]] vectors at that point.

More generally for a point $x$ in a [[Lorentzian manifold]] $(X,g)$, its lightcone is the lightcone in the [[tangent space]] $T_x X$.

Sometimes one also calls the collection of all [[time-like]] vectors the light cone, then denoted $V_x \subset T_x X$. On a [[time orientation|time oriented]] spacetime this decomposes into the _[[future cone]]_ $V_x^+$ and the _[[past cone]]_ $V_x^-$.
