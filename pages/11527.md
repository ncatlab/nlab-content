## Idea 

The statement known as _Segal's conjecture_ (due to [[Graeme Segal]] in the 1970s, then proven by [Carlsson 84](#Carlsson84)) characterizes the [[stable cohomotopy]] [[cohomology group|groups]] $\pi^\bullet_{st}(B G)$ of the [[classifying space]] $B G$ of a [[finite group]] $G$ as the [[formal completion]] $\widehat \pi^\bullet_S(B G)$ at the [[augmentation ideal]] (i.e. when regarded as a [[ring of functions]]: its restriction to the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of the basepoint) of the [[ring]] $\pi^\bullet_{st,G}(\ast)$ of $G$-[[equivariant stable cohomotopy]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] of the point, the latter also being [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Burnside ring]] $A(G)$ of $G$:

$$
  A(G) 
   \simeq 
  \pi^\bullet_{st,G}(\ast) 
    \overset{ \text{completion} \atop \text{projection} }{\longrightarrow}
  \widehat \pi^\bullet_{st,G}(\ast) 
    \simeq
  \pi^\bullet_{st}(B G)
  \,.
$$

This statement is the direct analogue of the [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]], which makes the analogous statement for the [[generalized cohomology]] not being ([[equivariant stable cohomotopy|equivariant]]) [[stable cohomotopy]] but ([[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]]) [[complex K-theory]] (with the role of the [[Burnside ring]] then being the [[representation ring]] of $G$).
