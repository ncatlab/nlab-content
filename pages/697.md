In the groupoid survey listed below,  the term _higher dimensional algebra_ was introduced in the provocative form: _n-dimensional phenomena require for their description n-dimensional algebra_. Since then the term  has come to be used in various senses, and  to include most forms of research into higher order categories, often  of a lax nature. A more specific definition is to say that Higher Dimensional Algebra  means _the study of systems of partial algebraic structures whose domains of definition are given by geometric conditions_.  

Of course the partial composition of paths or of functions was used if not formalised early on. The earliest formal use  of partial operations in algebra  was that of a [[groupoid]] as defined by Brandt in 1926, in connection with the laws for the classification of quaternary quadratic forms, generalising Gauss' work on binary quadratic forms. Curiously, groupoids were  not given as an example in Eilenberg and Mac Lane's fundamental paper on category theory, although they were well known by the Chicago algebraists of the time. The general theory of such partial algebra was developed by Philip Higgins.

The next easiest to understand example in dimension 2 is possibly that of  maps $a: I^2 \to X$ where $X$ is a topological space, called _squares in $X$_. Such a map determines  four paths $\partial^\epsilon _i a: I \to X$ for $i=1,2, \epsilon=\pm$ given by $\partial^- _1 a(t)= a(0,t), \partial^+ _1 a(t)=a(1,t), \partial^- _2 a(t)= a(t,0), \partial^+ _2 a(t)=a(t,1)$. Such squares in $X$  have 2 obvious partial compositions $\circ_1,\circ_2$ where for example $a\circ_1 b$ is defined if and only if $\partial^+ _1 a= \partial^- _1 b$. 

The problem is to obtain a _strict homotopy double groupoid_ from such squares. Brown and Higgins realised in 1974 that this could be achieved  fairly easily  in a relative situation, i.e. if we are given a triple $X_*=(X,A,C)$ where $C \subseteq A \subseteq X$,  and then consider maps $I^2 \to X$ which take the edges into $A$ and the vertices into $C$, and then form $\rho X_*$ of homotopy classes of such maps rel vertices. It is not quite trivial to prove that the partial compositions of such squares are inherited by $\rho X_*$ to make it a double groupoid, and that, quite importantly, there is an extra structure of _connections_. This extra structure makes the category of such objects equivalent to the category of [[crossed module]]s but of groupoids, rather than just groups. 

Under this equivalence, the double groupoid $\rho X_*$ becomes the crossed module $\Pi X_* $ consisting of the family of relative homotopy groups $\pi_2(X,A,c)$, $c \in C$, with the boundary to the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\pi_1(A,C)$ and the operations of this groupoid. Hence a van Kampen type theorem for $\rho$ yields a van Kampen type theorem for $\Pi$ and so  previously unobtainable determinations of some nonabelian second relative homotopy groups. 

Notice that the compositions in $\pi_2(X,A,c)$ require a choice of direction, and so is unaesthetic, whereas $\rho$ is a _symmetric_ construction. Also $\rho$ allows for convenient multiple compositions appropriate to _algebraic inverses to subdivision_, which are essential for the proof of the 2-dimensional van Kampen type theorem.
