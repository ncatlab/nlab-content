## Idea

_Cartier [[duality]]_ is a refinement of [[Pontryagin duality]] form [[topological groups]] to [[group schemes]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


Let $G$ be a [[finite group scheme]] over $k$, regarded as a
[[sheaf]] of groups $G \in Sh(Ring^{op}_k)$. Write $\mathbb{G}_m$ for the [[multiplicative group]], similarly regarded. 

Then the _Cartier dual_ $\widehat G$ is the [[internal hom]]

$$
  \widehat G \coloneqq [G,\mathbb{G}_{m}]
$$

of group [[homomorphisms]], hence the [[sheaf]] which to $R \in Ring_k^{op}$ assigns the [[set]]

$$
  \widehat G \;\colon\; R \mapsto Hom_{Grp/Spec R}(G \times Spec R, \mathbb{G}_m \times Spec R)
$$

of group homomorphisms over $Spec(R)$

This appears for instance as ([Polishuk, (10.1.11)](#Polishchuk)).

###### Proposition

Cartier duality is indeed a duality in that for any $G$ as above there is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  \widehat{\widehat{G}} \simeq G
$$

of the double Cartier dual with the original group scheme.
