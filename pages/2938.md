## Idea

The _Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem_ identifies the [[Hochschild homology]] and -cohomology of certain [[algebra]]s with [[Kähler differential]]s and [[derivation]]s, respectibely


## Details

### For commutative $k$-algebras

First notice that we always have the following statement about the situation in degree 1.

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For a $k$-algebra $R$, its module of [[Kähler differential]]s coincides with its first Hochschild homology

$$
  \Omega(R/k) \simeq H_1(R,R)
  \,.
$$


=--

Write $\Omega^0(R/k) := R \simeq HH_0(R,R)$.

The HKR-theorem generalizes this to higher degrees.

#### As an isomorphism of chain complexes

For $n \geq 2$ write $\Omega^n(R/k) = \wedge^n_R \Omega(R/k)$ for the $n$-fold [[exterior algebra|wedge product]] of $Omega(R/k)$ with itself: the degree $n$-Kähler forms.

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

The isomorphism $\Omega^1(R/k) \simeq H_1(R,R)$ extends to a graded ring morphism

$$
  \psi : \Omega^\bullet(R/k) \to H_\bullet(R,R)
  \,.
$$

=--

If the $k$-algebra $R$ is sufficiently well-behaved, then this morphism is an [[isomorphism]] that identifies the Hochschild homology of $R$ in degree $n$ with $\Omega^n(R/k)$ for all $n$:

###### Theorem
**(Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem)**

If $k$ is a [[field]] and $A$ a commutative $k$-[[algebra]] which is 

* essentially of finite type (finitely presented)

* [[smooth scheme|smooth]] over $k$, meaning:

  * the  $A$-[[module]] of [[Kähler differential]]s $\Omega^1_k(A)$ is a [[projective object]] in $A Mod$_k.

then there is an [[isomorphism]] of graded $k$-algebras

$$
  \psi : \Omega^\bullet(A/k) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_\bullet(A,A)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, dually, there is an isomorphism of Hochschild cohomology with wedge products of derivations:

$$
  \wedge^\bullet_k Der_k(A,A) \simeq HH^\bullet(A,A)
  \,.
$$

###### Proof

This is reviewed for instance as theorem 9.4.7 of

* [[Charles Weibel]], _[[An Introduction to Homological Algebra]]_

or as theorem 9.1.3 in [Ginzburg](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0506/0506603v1.pdf#page=44).

#### As an isomorphism of $\infty$-algebras

Actually, the HKR theorem holds on the level of chains: there is a quasi-isomorphism of dg vector spaces from polyvector fields (with zero differential) to the Hochschild cochain complex (with Hochschild differential).

The HKR map is a map of dg vector spaces, but not a map of dg algebras nor a map of dg Lie algebras. However, the [[Kontsevich formality|formality theorem]] of Kontsevich states that nevertheless the HKR map can be extended to an $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphism. See [this MO post](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/32889/a-few-questions-about-kontsevich-formality) for details. 

The HKR map is only an isomorphism of vector spaces, not an isomorphism of algebras. In order to make it an isomorphism of algebras, one must add a "correction" by the square root of the $\hat{A}$ class. This is analogous to the [[Duflo isomorphism]]. See Kontsevich and Caldararu.




### For non-commutative algebras

There is also a noncommutative analogue due to [[Alain Connes]].
