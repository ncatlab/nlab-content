## Idea

[Rector 74](#Rector74) proved the analog of the [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]] with [[topological K-theory]] replaced by the [[algebraic K-theory]] $K \mathbb{F}_p$ of a [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_p$. 

This theorem further amplifies the analogy to the [[Segal-Carlsson completion theorem]] for [[stable cohomotopy]] and the interpretation of the latter as the algebraic K-theory over the "[[field with one element]]" ([Guillot 06](#Guillot06)):
