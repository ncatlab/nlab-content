
In [[logic]], $\alpha$-equivalence is the principle that two syntactic expressions ([[types]], [[terms]], [[propositions]], [[contexts]], whatever) are equivalent for all purposes if their only difference is the renaming of bound [[variables]].  Depending on the technicalities of how variables are managed, $\alpha$-equivalence may be a necessary axiom, a provable theorem, or entirely trivial.  In any case, it is often (usually? always?) seen as a technicality devoid of interest.
