A [[monoidal category]] is **semicartesian** if the unit for the tensor product is a [[terminal object]].  This a weakening of the concept of [[cartesian monoidal category]], which might seem like pointless [[centipede mathematics]] were it not for the existence of many interesting examples.  

Some examples of semicartesian monoidal categories that are not cartesian include:

* the category of [[Poisson manifold]]s with the usual product of Poisson manifolds as its tensor product, 

* the opposite of the category of [[associative algebra]]s over a given [[base field]] $k$ with its usual tensor product $A \otimes B$, 

* the category of [[affine space]]s made into a [[closed monoidal category]] where the [[internal hom]] has $hom(x,y)$ being the set of affine maps from $x$ to $y$, made into an affine space via pointwise operations,

* the category of [[convex set]]s, made into a closed monoidal category where the internal hom has $hom(x,y)$ being the set of convex maps from $x$ to $y$, made into an convex space via pointwise operations.

Which meaning of 'convex set' are you using here?

[[John Baez]]: roughly speaking: a set equipped with $n$-ary 'convex linear combination' operations, one for every $n$-tuple of real numbers in $[0,1]$ that add to 1, obeying some obvious axioms.  There is a Lawvere theory for convex sets and it's a <i>lot</i> like the algebraic theory for real [[affine space|affine spaces]] (described already on the $n$Lab): I think you just throw in one extra condition, namely that we only allow affine linear combinations where the coefficients lie in [0,1].

In a semicartesian monoidal category, any tensor product of objects $x \otimes y$ comes equipped with morphisms 
$$ p_x : x \otimes y  \to x $$
$$ p_y : x \otimes y \to y$$
given by
$$ x \otimes y \stackrel{1 \otimes e_y}{\longrightarrow} x \otimes I \stackrel{r_x}{\longrightarrow} x $$
and
$$ x \otimes y \stackrel{e_x \otimes 1}{\longrightarrow} I \otimes y \stackrel{\ell_y}{\longrightarrow} y $$
respectively, where $e$ stands for the unique morphism to the terminal object and $r$, $\ell$ are the right and left unitors.  We can thus ask whether $p_x$ and $p_y$ make $x \otimes y$ into the [[product]] of $x$ and $y$.  If so, it is a theorem that $C$ is a cartesian monoidal category.  (This theorem is probably in Eilenberg and Kelly's paper on closed categories, but they may not have been the first to note it.)
