## Idea

A kind of _coherence theorem for [[closed symmetric monoidal categories]]_, conjectured by Saunders Mac Lane in the 60's and proved by Sergei Soloviev in the 90's, says the following:

###### Theorem
A diagram in a free closed symmetric monoidal category is commutative if and only if all its instantiations in vector spaces are commutative.

One may use vector spaces over any (fixed) field. In fact, Soloviev's result is more general that this and provides an axiomatic description of "test categories" for which the theorem holds.
