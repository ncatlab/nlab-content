The __denial inequality__ is the [[negation]] of [[equality]].

This is a term found in [[constructive mathematics]], to distinguish from other [[inequality relations]] such as [[apartness]].  It is taken for granted in [[classical mathematics]].

If one wishes to reserve the word "inequality" for [[order]] relations (such as $\le$ and $\lt$), then one may instead use the word **disequality** to refer to the denial inequality.  (For instance, this is common in [[type theory]] with [[subtype]] relations that form an ordering on the types.)
