## Definition

A **constant sheaf** is a [[sheaf]] (on some [[site]] C) that is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[sheafification]] of a constant [[presheaf]] (a constant [[functor]]).

Together with the [[global section]] functor, the constant sheaf functor is a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  \Gamma : Sh(C) \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Set : const
$$

from the [[Grothendieck topos|sheaf topos]] to the [[topos]] [[Set]].


## Generalizations

The notion of constant sheaf sits in a hierarchy of related notions:

* A section of a constant sheaf is a [[locally constant function]]. 

* A section of a [[constant stack]] is a [[locally constant sheaf]].

For the full story see [[locally constant âˆž-stack]].

## Examples

* The [[natural numbers object]] in any [[Grothendieck topos]] is the constant sheaf on the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers.
