## Idea

A closed monoidal category $C$ is a [[monoidal category]] that is also a [[closed category]], in a compatible way:

it has for each [[object]] $X$ a [[functor]] $(-) \otimes X : C \to C$ of forming the [[tensor product]] with $X$, as well as a functor $[X,-] : C \to C$ of forming the [[internal-hom]] with $X$, and these form a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s.


## Formalization ##

The strategy for formalizing the idea of a closed category, that "the collection of morphisms from $a$ to $b$ can be regarded as an object of $C$ itself", is to mimic the situation in [[Set]] where for any three objects (sets) $a$, $b$, $c$ we have an isomorphism
$$
  Hom(a \otimes b, c) \simeq Hom(a, Hom(b,c))
  \,,
$$
naturally in all three arguments,
where $\otimes = \times$ is the standard [[cartesian product]] of sets.  This [[natural isomorphism]] is called [[currying]].

Currying can be read as a characterization of the [[internal hom]] $Hom(b,c)$ and is the basis for the following definition.


## Definition #

A symmetric [[monoidal category]] $C$ is **closed** if for all objects $b \in C_0$ the functor $ - \otimes b : C \to C$ has a [[adjoint functor|right adjoint]] functor $[b,-] : C \to C$.

This means that for all $a,b,c \in C_0$ we have a bijection

$$
  Hom_C(a \otimes b, c) \simeq Hom_C(a, [b,c])
$$

natural in all arguments.

The object $[b,c]$ is called the **internal hom** of $b$ and $c$. This is commonly also denoted by lower case $hom(b,c)$ (and then often underlined).

If the monoidal structure of $C$ is [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]], then $C$ is called **cartesian closed**.  In this case the internal hom is often called an **exponential** and written $c^b$.

If $C$ is not symmetric, then $-\otimes b$ and $b\otimes -$ are different functors, and either one or both may have an adjoint.  The terminology here is less standard, but many people use **left closed**, **right closed**, and **biclosed**.


## Examples ##

 * The tautological example is the category [[Set]] of sets: the collection of maps between any two sets is itself a set.  More generally, any [[topos]] is cartesian closed.

 * The category of abelian groups is closed: for any two abelian groups $A, B$ the set of homomorphisms $A \to B$ carries (pointwise defined) abelian group structure. 

 * Certain [[nice category of spaces|nice categories]] of topological spaces are cartesian closed: for any two nice enough topological spaces $X$, $Y$ the set of continuous maps $X \to Y$ can be equipped with a topology to become a nice topological space itself.

 * Certain nice categories of _based_  topological spaces are closed symmetric monoidal.  The monoidal structure is the [[smash product]] and the internal-hom is the set of basepoint-preserving maps with topology induced from the space of unbased ones.

 * The category [[Cat]] is cartesian closed: the internal-hom is the [[functor category]] of functors and natural transformations.

 * The category $2 Cat$ of [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]] and strict 2-functors is closed symmetric monoidal under the [[Gray tensor product]].  The internal-hom is the 2-category of strict 2-functors, _pseudo_ natural transformations, and modifications.

 * The category of strict $\omega$-[[strict omega-category|categories]] is also biclosed monoidal, under the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

 * If $M$ is a monoidal category and $Set^{M^{op}}$ is endowed with the tensor product given by the induced [[Day convolution]] product, then $Set^{M^{op}}$ is biclosed monoidal. 

 * The category of [[species]], with the monoidal structure given by substitution product of species, is closed monoidal (each functor $- \circ G$ admits a right adjoint) but not biclosed monoidal.
