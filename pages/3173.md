The local Lie groups are inifinitesimal versions of Lie groups, containing information about the product operation in some smooth neighborhood of the unit element; the multiplication is defined only when the factors are sufficiently close to the unit element, and if the consecutive products of triples in both ways are defined they are associative. 

The category of real Local Lie groups is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras. This has been proved by [[Sophus Lie]]. The extension to the global Lie theory has been possible only after works of [[Ã‰lie Cartan]], who extended the equivalence to the equivalence between the category of real Lie algebras and connected simply connected Lie groups.
