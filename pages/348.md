#Idea#

A _sieve_ is a formalization of the notion of [[cover]] in the context of [[sheaf and topos theory]].

The motivating example is from the category [[Top]] of topological spaces. Take $c = X$ to be any topological space and let $\{d_i\} = \{U_i\}$ be a cover of $X$ by open subsets $U_i$ in the ordinary sense (i.e. each $U_i$ is an open subset of $X$ and their joint union is $X$, $\cup_i U_i = X$), then 
$\pi : (\sqcup_i U_i) \stackrel{\sqcup_i U_i \hookrightarrow_i X}{\to} X$ is a _cover_ of $X$. 

The **idea of sieves** is to regard such a cover of an object in a category as a [[presheaf]] on that category.

A choice of collections of morphism $d \to c$ into an object $c \in C$  for each $d \in C$ reminds one of the [[representable functor]] [[presheaf]]
$\hom_C(-, c): C^{op} \to Set$ which assigns to each $d \in C$ the set of _all_ morphisms from $d$ to $c$. Every choice of covers of $c$ is therefore for each $d \in C$ a subset of the value of this functor evaluated at $d$. This begins to look like an [[monomorphism|monic]] [[natural transformation]] into this functor. Indeed, it turns out that one can assume without restriction of generality that the assignment of covers of $c$ can always be extended to such a monic natural transformation, and hence one formalizes the notion of "collection of covers" of $c$ as a [[subobject]] $i: F \hookrightarrow \hom(-, c)$ of the functor represented by $c$: a _sieve_ at $c$. 


#Definition#

###### Definition
A _sieve_ (Fr. _crible_) on an object $c$ is a subfunctor (a [[subobject]] in the [[functor category]]) of the [[representable functor]] $\hom_C(-, c): C^{op} \to Set$. 
=--

Thus, a sieve on $c$, $i: F \hookrightarrow \hom(-, c)$, may be described as a function which assigns to each object $d$ a collection of morphisms $f: d \to c$ into $c$. Naturality of the inclusion $i$ means that whenever $f: d \to c$ belongs to the sieve and $g: e \to d$ is any morphism, then $f g: e \to c$ also belongs to the sieve. 

Sometimes this condition (of a sieve being closed under the operation of pulling back along an arbitrary morphism $g: e \to d$) is called a "saturation condition". At any rate, given any collection of morphisms targeted at $c$, we can always close it up or saturate it, to obtain a sieve on $c$. 

Notice that because the pullback of a subfunctor $i: F \hookrightarrow \hom(-, c)$ along any morphism $\hom(-, g): \hom(-, d) \to \hom(-, c)$ is again a subfunctor $g^* F$ of $d$, sieves are closed under pulling back. Concretely, 

$$g^* F = \bigcup_{e \in Ob(C)} \{f: e \to d: g f \in F\}
\,.$$

#Remarks#

* Sieves are used to define [[Grothendieck topology]] and [[site]].

#Examples#

##Covers by open subsets##

Consider again covers and sieves in the category [[Top]] of topological spaces.


Each open covering $\sqcup_i U_i \to X$ of a topological space $X$ by open subsets $U_i$
induces a subfunctor 

$$
  (F := \bigcup_i \hom(-, U_i)) \to \hom(-, X)
$$

where on the left we take a union of subfunctors $\hom(-, U_i) \to \hom(-, X)$. This subfunctor $F$ is the **sieve incarnation of the cover** $\sqcup_i U_i$.

### Recovering the sheaf condition from morphisms out of the sieve###

We now show that $F$ is the _right_ sieve incarnation of the cover by demonstrating that using it the usual [[sheaf|sheaf condition]] on a presheaf with respect to the cover $\sqcup_i U_i$ is reproduced:

First notice that $F$ is precisely the coequalizer of the obvious pair of morphisms

$$
  \sqcup_{i, j} \hom(-, U_i \cap U_j)
    \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  \sqcup_i hom(-, U_i)
$$

where the domain of this parallel pair is the pullback of the evident map
$\sqcup_i hom(-, U_i) \to hom(-,X)$  
along itself, and the two parallel arrows are the projection maps out of this pullback:

$$
  \array{
     \sqcup_{i,j} hom(-,U_i \cap U_j)
     &\to&
     \sqcup_i hom(-, U_j)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \sqcup_i hom(-, U_i)
     &\to&
     hom(-,X)
  }
$$
 
Thus for $G$ any [[presheaf]],
maps $F \to G$ are precisely the same as maps
$\sqcup_i \hom(-, U_i) \to G$
which coequalize the parallel pair. Applying $Hom_{Set^{C^{op}}}(-,G)$ to the colimit diagram

$$
  \sqcup_{i, j} \hom(-, U_i \cap U_j)
    \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  \sqcup_i hom(-, U_i)
  \to
  F
$$
                     
yields the limit diagram

$$
  Hom(F, G)
  \to 
  Hom(\sqcup_i hom(-, U_i), G)
  \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  Hom(\sqcup_{i, j} \hom(-, U_i \cap U_j), G)
$$

which using [[Yoneda lemma|Yoneda]] is the equalizer diagram

$$
  Hom(F,G)
  \to
 \prod_i G(U_i) \stackrel{\to}{\to} \prod_{i, j} G(U_i \cap U_j)
$$

and hence identifies $Hom(F,G)$ indeed as the set of [[descent]] data for the [[sheaf]] condition on $G$. 

### Interpretation in terms of higher descent and codescent ###

(... I'll expand on the following later ...)

As described at [[descent]], for $(Y = \sqcup_i U_i) \to X$ a cover of spaces, there is an $\infty$-groupoid

$$
  Codesc(Y) := \int^{[n] \in \Delta} O([n])\cdot Y^{[n+1]}
$$

(with $O([n])$ the free $\infty$-groupoid on the $n$-simplex)
which resolves the &Ccaron;ech groupoid of the cover. (For the following statement the &Ccaron;ech groupoid itself is already sufficient.)

The sieve associated with the cover is the presheaf obtained by starting with the $\infty$-prestack represented by $Codesc(Y)$ and passing to equivalence classes.

$$
  \bigcup_i hom(-,U_i)
  \simeq
  hom(-, Codesc(Y))/_\sim
  \,.
$$
