# Span

## Definition

$Span$ is the [[bicategory]], or [[double category]], whose

* objects are [[sets]]
* (horizontal) morphisms are [[spans]]
* 2-cells are morphisms of spans
* (in the double category case) vertical morphisms are [[functions]].

More generally, we have $Span(C)$ consists of spans in $C$ for any [[category]] $C$ with [[pullbacks]].

## Properties

$Span$ is a sort of classifying object for arbitrary functors; see _[[displayed category]]_.

## Categorifications

There is an [[(infinity,n)-category of correspondences]].
