## Idea

_Coinduction_ is a method of [[proof]] which relies on the fact that any two states of the [[terminal coalgebra]] [[algebra for an endofunctor|for an endofunctor]] $H$ must be equal if they are indistinguishable under repeated operations of $H$. That is, there are no proper coalgebra [[quotient objects]]. Generally, we show the existence of a [[bisimulation]] between states of terminal coalgebra, that is a relation between states, such that when the coalgebra function is
applied, the respective outputs are still related. Since any bisimulation must be contained within the identity relation, we can then conclude that the states are equal.

Coinduction is [[duality|dual]] to [[induction]].  It generalises to [[corecursion]].

## Examples

Take $add\colon \bar{\mathbb{N}} \times \bar{\mathbb{N}} \to 1 + \bar{\mathbb{N}} \times \bar{\mathbb{N}}$ as defined at [[corecursion]], which defines an addition $+$ on the extended natural numbers. We can then establish a bisimulation between the terms $(n + m)$ and $(m + n)$, from which we can conclude that this addition is commutative. (See p. 52 of Rutten [Universal coalgebra: a theory of systems](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~janr/papers/files-of-papers/universal_coalgebra.pdf).)
