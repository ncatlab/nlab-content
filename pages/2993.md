## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. A polynomial with coefficients in $R$, is, _par abus de langage_, an element of a [[free object|free]] $R$-[[module]] generated by the underlying set of a [[commutative monoid]] that is itself freely generated by a set whose elements are traditionally called "[[variables]]" or "indeterminates". 

The abuse of language is that the secondary-school concept of "a polynomial", taken in isolation, has no coherent sense. That is, a polynomial might be anything whatsoever -- as long as it being considered as a term of a type a ring structure with the appropriate universal property, namely that any function from the given set of variables to the underlying set of a commutative $R$-algebra $A$ uniquely extends to an algebra homomorphism from the polynomial algebra to $A$: that's all that really counts. (*Mathematics Made Difficult* puts the matter very well, and I will quote it as soon as I find my copy.) Of course there are traditional syntactic representations that people usually have in mind when they speak of "a polynomial" as such.

###### Example

The set of **polynomials** in one 
[[variable]] $z$ with [[coefficients]] in $R$ is the set $R[\mathbb{N}]$ of all [[formal linear combinations]] on elements $n \in \mathbb{N}$, thought of as powers $z^n$ of the variable $z$. As a string of symbols, a polynomial is frequently represented by a form like 

$$ 
  a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 
  \,,
$$

where $n$ is an arbitrary [[natural number]] and $a_0, \dots, a_n \in R$, subject to the usual fine print (where we work [[quotient set|modulo]] the [[congruence]] generated by equations of the form

$$ 
  0 z^{n+1} + a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 = a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 $$

(so that we ignore coefficients of zero).

This set is equipped with an $R$-module structure (where formal linear combinations are added and scalar-multiplied as usual) and also with the structure of a ring, in fact a [[commutative algebra]] over $R$, denoted $R[z]$
and called the **polynomial ring** or **ring of polynomials**, with multiplication given by the unique [[bilinear map]]

$$
  R[z] \cdot R[z] \to R[z]
$$

that extends the multiplication of monomials given by

$$
  z^k \cdot z^l = z^{k+l}
  \,.
$$

In addition to the ring structure, there is a further operation $R[z] \times R[z] \to R[z]$ which may be described as "substitution"; see Remark \ref{substitution} below for a general description (which applies in fact to any [[Lawvere theory]]). 

Moreover, there is a noncommutative analogue of polynomial ring on a set $X$, efficiently described as the free $R$-[[module]] generated by the (underlying set of the) free [[monoid]] on $X$. This carries also a ring structure, with ring multiplication induced from the monoid multiplication. A far-reaching generalization of this construction is given at [[distributive law]]. 

Finally: polynomial algebras may be regarded as [[graded algebras]] (graded over $\mathbb{N}$). Specifically: let us regard $R[X]$ as the free $R$-module generated by (the underlying set of) the free [[commutative monoid]] $F(X)$. The monoid homomorphism $F(!): F(X) \to F(1) \cong \mathbb{N}$ induced by the unique function $!: X \to 1$ gives an $\mathbb{N}$-fibering of $F(X)$ over $\mathbb{N}$, with typical fiber $F(X)_n$ whose elements are called *monomials of degree $n$*. Then the _homogeneous component_ of degree $n$ in $R[X]$ is the $R$-submodule generated by the subset $F(X)_n \subset F(X)$. The elements of this component are called *homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$*. 

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The polynomial ring $R[z]$ is the [[free construction|free]] $R$-[[commutative algebra|algebra]] on one generator (the variable $z$).  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the definition of [[free objects]] one needs to check that ring [[homomorphisms]]

$$
  f : R[z] \to K
$$

to another ring K are in [[natural bijection]] with [[functions]] of [[sets]]

$$
  \bar f : * \to K
$$

from the [[singleton]] to the set underlying $K$. Take $\bar f \coloneqq f(z)$. Using $R$-linearity, this is directly seen to yield the desired bijection.

###### Remark

Similarly, the set of polynomials in any give [[set]] of variables with coefficients in $R$ is the [[free construction|free]] commutative $R$-algebra on that set of generators; see [[symmetric power]] and [[symmetric algebra]].

###### Remark 
As usual in the study of universal algebra via [[Lawvere theories]], there is an [[operad]] whose $n^{th}$ component $C_n$ is the free algebra $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, and whose operadic multiplication is given by maps 
$$C_n \times C_{n_1} \times \ldots \times C_{n_k} \to C_n$$ 
($n = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$) that take a tuple of elements $(p; q_1, \ldots, q_k)$ to $p(q_1(x), \ldots, q_k(x))$. Formally, it takes this tuple to the value of $p$ under the unique algebra map $R[x_1, \ldots, x_k] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ that extends the mapping $x_j \mapsto i_j(q_j)$. Here the $i_j: R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n_j}] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ are appropriate coproduct inclusions (in the category of commutative rings), where $i_j(x_l) = x_{n_1 + \ldots + n_{j-1} + l}$. A particularly important case of substitution is the case $k=1$ and $n_1 = 1$, where the map $R[x] \times R[x] \to R[x]$ is ordinary substitution $(p, q) \mapsto p(q(x))$. This is a special case of the more general notion of [[Tall-Wraith monoid]].

###### Remark

In case $R$ is an [[integral domain]], the [[field of fractions]] of $R[z]$ is the [[field]] $R(z)$ of [[rational functions]].
