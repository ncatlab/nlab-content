## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]].

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The set of **polynomials** in one 
[[variable]] with [[coefficients]] in $R$ is the set $R[\mathbb{N}]$ of all [[formal linear combinations]] on elements $n \in \mathbb{N}$, thought of as powers $x^n$ of the variable $x$

$$ 
  a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 
  \,,
$$

where $n$ is an arbitrary [[natural number]] and $a_0, \dots, a_n \in R$, [[quotient set|modulo]] the [[equivalence relation]] generated by equations of the form

$$ 
  0 z^{n+1} + a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 = a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 $$

(so that we ignore coefficients of zero).


This set is equipped with the structure of a ring itself, in fact a [[commutative algebra]] over $R$, denoted $R[z]$
and called the **polynomial ring** or **ring of polynomials** given by the unique [[bilinear map]]

$$
  R[z] \cdot R[z] \to R[z]
$$

which on monomials is given by

$$
  z^k \cdot z^l = z^{k+l}
  \,.
$$

=-- 

In addition to the ring structure, there is a further operation $R[z] \times R[z] \to R[z]$ which may be described as "substitution"; see Remark \ref{substitution} below for a general description (which applies in fact to any [[Lawvere theory]]). 

Moreover, there is a noncommutative analogue of polynomial ring on a set $X$, efficiently described as the free $R$-[[module]] generated by the (underlying set of the) free [[monoid]] on $X$. This carries also a ring structure, with ring multiplication induced from the monoid multiplication. A far-reaching generalization of this construction is given at [[distributive law]]. 

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The polynomial ring $R[z]$ is the [[free construction|free]] $R$-[[commutative algebra|algebra]] on one generator (the variable $z$).  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the definition of [[free objects]] one needs to check that ring [[homomorphisms]]

$$
  f : R[z] \to K
$$

to another ring K are in [[natural bijection]] with [[functions]] of [[sets]]

$$
  \bar f : * \to K
$$

from the [[singleton]] to the set underlying $K$. Take $\bar f \coloneqq f(z)$. Using $R$-linearity, this is directly seen to yield the desired bijection.

###### Remark

Similarly, the set of polynomials in any give [[set]] of variables with coefficients in $R$ is the [[free construction|free]] commutative $R$-algebra on that set of generators; see [[symmetric power]] and [[symmetric algebra]].

+-- {: .num_remark #substitution} 
###### Remark 
As usual in the study of universal algebra via [[Lawvere theories]], there is an [[operad]] whose $n^{th}$ component $C_n$ is the free algebra $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, and whose operadic multiplication is given by maps 
$$C_n \times C_{n_1} \times \ldots \times C_{n_k} \to C_n$$ 
($n = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$) that take a tuple of elements $(p; q_1, \ldots, q_k)$ to $p(q_1(x), \ldots, q_k(x))$. Formally, it takes this tuple to the value of $p$ under the unique algebra map $R[x_1, \ldots, x_k] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ that extends the mapping $x_j \mapsto i_j(q_j)$. Here the $i_j: R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n_j}] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ are appropriate coproduct inclusions (in the category of commutative rings), where $i_j(x_l) = x_{n_1 + \ldots + n_{j-1} + l}$. A particularly important case of substitution is the case $k=1$ and $n_1 = 1$, where the map $R[x] \times R[x] \to R[x]$ is ordinary substitution $(p, q) \mapsto p(q(x))$. This is a special case of the more general notion of [[Tall-Wraith monoid]].

###### Remark

In case $R$ is an [[integral domain]], the [[field of fractions]] of $R[z]$ is the [[field]] $R(z)$ of [[rational functions]].
