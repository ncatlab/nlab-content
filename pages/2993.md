## Definitions and meanings 

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. A _polynomial_ with coefficients in $R$ is an element of a **polynomial ring** over $R$. A polynomial ring over $R$ consists of a [[set]] $X$ whose elements are called "[[variables]]" or "indeterminates", and a [[function]] $X \to R[X]$ to (the underlying set of) a commutative $R$-algebra that is universal among such functions, so that $R[X]$ is the [[free object|free]] commutative $R$-algebra generated by $X$; a polynomial is then an element of the underlying set of $R[X]$.

###### Remark 
Much like "[[vector]]", the term "polynomial" in this sense may seem slightly deprecated from the viewpoint of modern mathematics. We no longer think of a vector space as consisting of things called "vectors" (i.e. we don't assign an objective meaning to "vectors"); it's the other way around, where we introduce a type of structure called a vector space and then, relative to a given vector space context, declare that "vector" just means a term of that type. Similarly, the term "polynomial" in the sense discussed here might be considered subordinate to the structural concept of polynomial ring. (Somewhere in Linderholm's *Mathematics Made Difficult* there is an amusing passage where someone points at an expression and asks "is that a polynomial?" and the respondent says, "yeah, I guess so... it looks like a polynomial... yep, that's a polynomial all right" -- an answer which is not wrong exactly, but not quite right either, since it fails to recognize that there is something questionable about the question.)

###### Remark 
Pursuing this further, however, we might more objectively identify the concept of "polynomial" (let us say a polynomial in $n$ variables) with a definable $n$-[[signature (in logic)|ary]] [[signature (in logic)|operation]] in the [[theory]] of commutative $R$-algebras. From a categorical perspective, if $U: CommAlg_R \to Set$ is the forgetful functor, a definable $n$-ary operation means a [[natural transformation]] $U^n \to U$. The connection is that the functor $U^n$ is [[representable functor|representable]], being represented by the [[free object]] $F[n] = R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, so that a natural transformation $U^n \to U$ is canonically identified with a transformation $\hom(R[x_1, \ldots, x_n], -) \to U$ or to an element of $U R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, by the [[Yoneda lemma]]. In pursuit of this objective meaning (which is essentially due to [[Lawvere]]), we find that the "variable" $x_i$ stands for the $i^{th}$ projection map $U^n \to U$, and that the meaning of (let's say) $x_1 x_2 \in R[x_1, x_2, x_3]$ is that it is the definable operation whose instantiation at any commutative $R$-algebra $A$ is the function $A^3 \to A$ taking $(a, b, c)$ to $a b$. 

Of course there are traditional [[syntax|syntactical]] standard forms that people usually have in mind when they speak of "a polynomial" as such. But leaving it at that, where polynomials are merely identified with syntactic forms, ignores the deeper objective meaning of definable operations. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
Finally, sometimes "polynomial" is construed to mean a *polynomial function*. This is actually just a particular instantiation of a definable operation. The default meaning is that, if we are working for instance with a polynomial ring in one variable $R[x]$, then we have a composite 
$$U R[x] \cong \hom(U, U) \stackrel{ev_R}{\to} \hom(U R, U R)$$ 
where the second map sends a natural transformation to its component at $R$ as an $R$-algebra. Put differently, the set $\hom(U R, U R)$ carries a commutative $R$-algebra structure under the pointwise operations, and there is a unique $R$-algebra map $R[x] \to \hom(U R, U R)$ that sends '$x$' to the [[identity map]]. The [[value]] of a polynomial $p \in R[x]$ under this map is then the corresponding polynomial function $U R \to U R$. 

This conflation of polynomials with polynomial functions is often forgivable, particularly in those cases where the map $R[x] \to \hom(U R, U R)$ is [[injective function|injective]] (so that 'polynomials' are identified with certain types of functions). Of course the map *won't* be injective if $R$ is [[finite set|finite]], to give one example. But in analysis, where we consider functions on $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, the conflation is familiar and rarely cause for concern. The conflation may also be responsible for certain notational artifacts, such as the common practice of writing $p(x)$ for polynomials $p$. 
=-- 

With these preliminary remarks out of the way, we recall some of the more syntactic considerations with an example. 

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The set of **polynomials** in one 
[[variable]] $z$ with [[coefficients]] in $R$ is the set $R[\mathbb{N}]$ of all [[formal linear combinations]] on elements $n \in \mathbb{N}$, thought of as powers $z^n$ of the variable $z$. As a string of symbols, a polynomial is frequently represented by a form like 

$$ 
  a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 
  \,,
$$

where $n$ is an arbitrary [[natural number]] and $a_0, \dots, a_n \in R$, subject to the usual fine print (where we work [[quotient set|modulo]] the [[congruence]] generated by equations of the form

$$ 
  0 z^{n+1} + a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 = a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 $$

so that we ignore coefficients of zero). (The **degree** of a polynomial is the maximum $n$ for which $a_n$ is nonzero, in which case the **leading term** of the polynomial is $a_n z^n$. A polynomial is **constant** if its degree is $0$.) 

This set is equipped with an $R$-module structure (where formal linear combinations are added and scalar-multiplied as usual) and also with the structure of a ring, in fact a [[commutative algebra]] over $R$, denoted $R[z]$
and called the **polynomial ring** or **ring of polynomials**, with ring multiplication 

$$
  R[z] \cdot R[z] \to R[z]
$$

the unique one that bilinearly extends the multiplication of monomials given by

$$
  z^k \cdot z^l = z^{k+l}
  \,.
$$

=-- 

Thus, one way to construct a polynomial ring is first to construct the free commutative monoid generated by a set $X$ (the monoid of monomials), and then to construct the free $R$-module generated by the underlying set of that monoid, extending the monoid multiplication to a ring multiplication by bilinearity. 

In addition to the ring structure, there is a further operation $R[z] \times R[z] \to R[z]$ which may be described as "substitution"; see Remark \ref{substitution} below for a general description (which applies in fact to any [[Lawvere theory]]). 

Moreover, there is a noncommutative analogue of polynomial ring on a set $X$, efficiently described as the free $R$-[[module]] generated by the (underlying set of the) free [[monoid]] on $X$. This carries also a ring structure, with ring multiplication induced from the monoid multiplication. A far-reaching generalization of this construction is given at [[distributive law]]. 

Finally: polynomial algebras may be regarded as [[graded algebras]] (graded over $\mathbb{N}$). Specifically: let us regard $R[X]$ as the free $R$-module generated by (the underlying set of) the free [[commutative monoid]] $F(X)$. The monoid homomorphism $F(!): F(X) \to F(1) \cong \mathbb{N}$ induced by the unique function $!: X \to 1$ gives an $\mathbb{N}$-fibering of $F(X)$ over $\mathbb{N}$, with typical fiber $F(X)_n$ whose elements are called *monomials of degree $n$*. Then the _homogeneous component_ of degree $n$ in $R[X]$ is the $R$-submodule generated by the subset $F(X)_n \subset F(X)$. The elements of this component are called *homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$*. 

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The polynomial ring $R[z]$ is the [[free construction|free]] $R$-[[commutative algebra|algebra]] on one generator (the variable $z$).  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the definition of [[free objects]] one needs to check that algebra [[homomorphisms]]

$$
  f : R[z] \to K
$$

to another algebra K are in [[natural bijection]] with [[functions]] of [[sets]]

$$
  \bar f : * \to K
$$

from the [[singleton]] to the set underlying $K$. Take $\bar f \coloneqq f(z)$. Using $R$-linearity, this is directly seen to yield the desired bijection.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Similarly, the set of polynomials in any given [[set]] of variables with coefficients in $R$ is the [[free construction|free]] commutative $R$-algebra on that set of generators; see [[symmetric power]] and [[symmetric algebra]].

=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark #substitution} 
###### Remark 
As usual in the study of universal algebra via [[Lawvere theories]], there is an [[operad]] whose $n^{th}$ component $C_n$ is the free algebra $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, and whose operadic multiplication is given by maps 
$$C_k \times C_{n_1} \times \ldots \times C_{n_k} \to C_n$$ 
($n = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$) that take a tuple of elements $(p; q_1, \ldots, q_k)$ to $p(q_1(x), \ldots, q_k(x))$. Formally, it takes this tuple to the value of $p$ under the unique algebra map $R[x_1, \ldots, x_k] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ that extends the mapping $x_j \mapsto i_j(q_j)$. Here the $i_j: R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n_j}] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ are appropriate coproduct inclusions (in the category of commutative rings), where $i_j(x_l) = x_{n_1 + \ldots + n_{j-1} + l}$. A particularly important case of substitution is the case $k=1$ and $n_1 = 1$, where the map $R[x] \times R[x] \to R[x]$ is ordinary substitution $(p, q) \mapsto p(q(x))$. This is a special case of the more general notion of [[Tall-Wraith monoid]].

###### Remark

In case $R$ is an [[integral domain]], the [[field of fractions]] of $R[z]$ is the [[field]] $R(z)$ of [[rational functions]].

### Polynomials in one variable 

In the case where $R = k$ is a [[field]], the polynomial ring $k[x]$ has a number of useful properties. One is that it is a [[Euclidean domain]], where the degree serves as the Euclidean function: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
Given $f, g \in k[x]$, there are unique $q, r \in k[x]$ such that $f = q \cdot g + r$ and $\deg(r) \lt \deg(g)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $\deg(f) \lt \deg(g)$, then $q = 0$ and $r = f$ will serve. Otherwise we may argue by [[induction]] on $\deg(f)$, where if $a_m x^m$ is the leading term of $f$ and $b_n x^n$ the leading term of $g$, then $f'(x) = f(x) - a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n}g(x)$ has lower degree than $f(x)$. This proves existence. Uniqueness is clear, since if $q \cdot g + r = q' \cdot g + r'$, we have $\deg((q - q')g) = \deg(r' - r) \lt \deg(g)$, which is impossible unless $q = q'$, and then $r = r'$ quickly follows. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_cor} 
###### Corollary 
$k[x]$ is a [[principal ideal domain]], and therefore a [[unique factorization domain]]. 
=-- 

See [[Euclidean domain]] for a proof. 

+-- {: .num_cor} 
###### Corollary 
If $a \in k$ is a [[root]] of $p(x) \in k[x]$, i.e., if the value of the polynomial function $p(a)$ is $0$, then $p(x)$ is of the form $(x - a)q(x)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Since we may write $p(x) = (x - a)q(x) + r$ where $\deg(r) \lt 1$, whence $r$ is a constant. By evaluating the polynomial function at $x = a$, the term $r$ is $0$. 
=-- 

This observation may be exploited in various neat ways. One is that if $p(x)$ is a polynomial, then $p(y) = p(x) + (y - x)q(x, y)$ for some unique $q(x, y) \in k[x, y]$ (work in the Euclidean domain $K[y]$ where $K$ is the field of [[rational functions]] $k(x)$, and then argue that the $K$-coefficients of $q$ are polynomial). A consequence is that the Lawvere theory of commutative $k$-algebras is a [[Fermat theory]]. The [[derivative]] of $p$ may be defined to be $q(x, x) \in k[x]$.
