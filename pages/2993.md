Given a commutative ring $R$, the ring of **polynomials** with coefficients in $R$ consists of all formal expressions

$$ a_n z^n + \cdots a_1 z + a_0 $$

where $n$ is an arbitrary natural number and $a_0, \dots, a_n \in R$.  This ring is denoted $R[z]$.  The addition and multiplication in this ring are defined in the obvious way.

The ring $R[z]$ may also be described more abstractly as the free $R$-algebra on one generator.
