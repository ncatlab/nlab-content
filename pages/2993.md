## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. A _polynomial_ with coefficients in $R$ is an element of a **polynomial ring** over $R$. A polynomial ring over $R$ consists of a set $X$ whose elements are called "[[variables]]" or "indeterminates", and a function $X \to R[X]$ to (the underlying set of) a commutative $R$-algebra that is universal among such functions, so that $R[X]$ is the free commutative $R$-algebra generated by $X$; a polynomial is then an element of the underlying set of $R[X]$.

###### Remark 
The terminology "polynomial", much like the terminology "[[vector]]", is slightly deprecated from the viewpoint of modern mathematics, as it is incoherent to ask of an entity in isolation "is it a polynomial"?  Somewhere in *Mathematics Made Difficult* there is an amusing passage about this (paraphrasing: "yeah, I guess so... it looks like a polynomial... yep, that's a polynomial all right" -- an answer which is neither demonstrably wrong nor affirmably right; it fails to recognize that the question itself is off). The basic structuralist point is that of course anything might be a polynomial, just so long as the ambient structure in which the entity is situated behaves as a _polynomial ring_; the structure considered *in toto* is what matters. Of course there are traditional syntactical standard forms that people usually have in mind when they speak of "a polynomial" as such.

###### Example

The set of **polynomials** in one 
[[variable]] $z$ with [[coefficients]] in $R$ is the set $R[\mathbb{N}]$ of all [[formal linear combinations]] on elements $n \in \mathbb{N}$, thought of as powers $z^n$ of the variable $z$. As a string of symbols, a polynomial is frequently represented by a form like 

$$ 
  a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 
  \,,
$$

where $n$ is an arbitrary [[natural number]] and $a_0, \dots, a_n \in R$, subject to the usual fine print (where we work [[quotient set|modulo]] the [[congruence]] generated by equations of the form

$$ 
  0 z^{n+1} + a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 = a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1 z + a_0 $$

(so that we ignore coefficients of zero).

This set is equipped with an $R$-module structure (where formal linear combinations are added and scalar-multiplied as usual) and also with the structure of a ring, in fact a [[commutative algebra]] over $R$, denoted $R[z]$
and called the **polynomial ring** or **ring of polynomials**, with ring multiplication 

$$
  R[z] \cdot R[z] \to R[z]
$$

the unique one that bilinearly extends the multiplication of monomials given by

$$
  z^k \cdot z^l = z^{k+l}
  \,.
$$

Thus, one way to construct a polynomial ring is first to construct the free commutative monoid generated by a set $X$ (the monoid of monomials), and then to construct the free $R$-module generated by the underlying set of that monoid, extending the monoid multiplication to a ring multiplication by bilinearity. 

In addition to the ring structure, there is a further operation $R[z] \times R[z] \to R[z]$ which may be described as "substitution"; see Remark \ref{substitution} below for a general description (which applies in fact to any [[Lawvere theory]]). 

Moreover, there is a noncommutative analogue of polynomial ring on a set $X$, efficiently described as the free $R$-[[module]] generated by the (underlying set of the) free [[monoid]] on $X$. This carries also a ring structure, with ring multiplication induced from the monoid multiplication. A far-reaching generalization of this construction is given at [[distributive law]]. 

Finally: polynomial algebras may be regarded as [[graded algebras]] (graded over $\mathbb{N}$). Specifically: let us regard $R[X]$ as the free $R$-module generated by (the underlying set of) the free [[commutative monoid]] $F(X)$. The monoid homomorphism $F(!): F(X) \to F(1) \cong \mathbb{N}$ induced by the unique function $!: X \to 1$ gives an $\mathbb{N}$-fibering of $F(X)$ over $\mathbb{N}$, with typical fiber $F(X)_n$ whose elements are called *monomials of degree $n$*. Then the _homogeneous component_ of degree $n$ in $R[X]$ is the $R$-submodule generated by the subset $F(X)_n \subset F(X)$. The elements of this component are called *homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$*. 

## Properties

###### Proposition

The polynomial ring $R[z]$ is the [[free construction|free]] $R$-[[commutative algebra|algebra]] on one generator (the variable $z$).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the definition of [[free objects]] one needs to check that ring [[homomorphisms]]

$$
  f : R[z] \to K
$$

to another ring K are in [[natural bijection]] with [[functions]] of [[sets]]

$$
  \bar f : * \to K
$$

from the [[singleton]] to the set underlying $K$. Take $\bar f \coloneqq f(z)$. Using $R$-linearity, this is directly seen to yield the desired bijection.

###### Remark

Similarly, the set of polynomials in any give [[set]] of variables with coefficients in $R$ is the [[free construction|free]] commutative $R$-algebra on that set of generators; see [[symmetric power]] and [[symmetric algebra]].

###### Remark 
As usual in the study of universal algebra via [[Lawvere theories]], there is an [[operad]] whose $n^{th}$ component $C_n$ is the free algebra $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, and whose operadic multiplication is given by maps 
$$C_n \times C_{n_1} \times \ldots \times C_{n_k} \to C_n$$ 
($n = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$) that take a tuple of elements $(p; q_1, \ldots, q_k)$ to $p(q_1(x), \ldots, q_k(x))$. Formally, it takes this tuple to the value of $p$ under the unique algebra map $R[x_1, \ldots, x_k] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ that extends the mapping $x_j \mapsto i_j(q_j)$. Here the $i_j: R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n_j}] \to R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ are appropriate coproduct inclusions (in the category of commutative rings), where $i_j(x_l) = x_{n_1 + \ldots + n_{j-1} + l}$. A particularly important case of substitution is the case $k=1$ and $n_1 = 1$, where the map $R[x] \times R[x] \to R[x]$ is ordinary substitution $(p, q) \mapsto p(q(x))$. This is a special case of the more general notion of [[Tall-Wraith monoid]].

###### Remark

In case $R$ is an [[integral domain]], the [[field of fractions]] of $R[z]$ is the [[field]] $R(z)$ of [[rational functions]].
