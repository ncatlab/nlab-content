## Idea

The special case of [[localization of model categories]] for [[simplicial model categories]].

A [[simplicial model category]] is a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of an [[(infinity,1)-category]]. 

The [[localization]] of a [[simplicial model category]] accordingly models the [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category|localization of the corresponding (infinity,1)-category]], i.e. the passage to the a [[reflective (infinity,1)-subcategory]]). 

## Examples 


* A famous example of localizations of simplicial model categories appears in the study of [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model structures on simplicial presheaves]], where it yields a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of [[(infinity,1)-sheafification]] completely analogous to how ordinary [[localization]] described ordinary [[sheafification]]:

  * the _global_ projective/injective model structures on simplicial presheaves on a [[site]] $S$ [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the $(\infty,1)$-category of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on $S$;

  * the [[Bousfield localization]] of these global model structures at morphisms which are local (stalkwise) weak equivalences yields the _local_ projective/injective model structure on simplicial presheaves on $S$, which then [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] on $S$.
