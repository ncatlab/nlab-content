> My research interests span a range of topics from [[quantization]] of [[gauge theories]] such as [[general relativity]] and [[Yang-Mills theory]] to [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[foundations]] of both gauge theories and [[quantum mechanics]]. With respect to the philosophy of gauge theories, I analyzed the physical content of the heuristic "gauge argument" in Yang-Mills theory and the ontological assumptions entailed by the passage from a global to a [[local symmetry]], I distinguished the two independent first principles of Yang-Mills theory—namely internal relativity and internal background independence—, and I proposed a conceptual interpretation of the [[BRST formalism]]. With respect to the philosophy of quantum mechanics, I’m working on a formalism which had never been addressed—up to my knowledge—by philosophers of quantum mechanics, namely [[geometric quantization]]. I showed that the corresponding technical shift in the presentation of quantum mechanics is the formal counterpart of a radically different conceptual comprehension of quantum physics. Indeed, this new avenue for research in the philosophy of quantum mechanics has already led to unexpected results. In particular, I showed that quantum mechanics endorses a realistic quantum ontology of [[physical systems]]. This conclusion contests the widespread idea according to which the passage from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics comes hand in hand with a weakening of the notion of physical objectivity. According to the proposed quantum ontology, quantum mechanics provides—unlike classical mechanics—a complete description of all the objective properties of physical systems.
