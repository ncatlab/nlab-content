[[!redirects scheme as structured locally affine infinity topos]]

it is argued that the standard definition of scheme with its insistance on an underlying topological space is slightly misleading:

> it is in some sense coincidental that $Spec A$ is described by a [[topological space]]. What arises more canonically is the [[lattice]] of open subsets of $Spec A$, which is generated by basic open sets of the form $U_f$. This lattice naturally forms a [[locale]], or [[0-topos]]. It happens that this [[locale]] has [[point of a topos|enough points]], and can therefore be described as the lattice of open subsets of a [[topological space]]. However, there are various reasons we might want to disregard this fact:

> a) The existence of [[point of a topos|enough points]] for $Spec A$ is equivalent to the assertion that every nonzero commutative ring contains a prime ideal, and the proof of this assertion requires the [[axiom of choice]].

> b) In _[[relative scheme|relative]]_ situations, the relevant construction may well fail to admit enough points, even if the [[axiom of choice]] is assumed. However, the underlying [[locale]] (and its associated sheaf theory) are still well-behaved

> c) If we wish to replace the Zariski topology by some other topology (such as the &eacute;tale topology), then we are forced to work with $Spec A$ as a [[topos]] rather than simply as a [[topological space]]: the category of &eacute,tale [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $Spec A$ is [[localic topos|not generated by]] [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object|final object]].

> When we study [[derived algebraic geometry]], we will want to study [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $Spec A$ of a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] nature, such as sheaves of [[topological space]]s or sheaves of [[spectrum|spectra]]. For these purposes it will be most convenient to regard $Spec A$ as an [[(∞,1)-topos]], rather than as a [[topological space]]. 

From that perspective then a scheme is realized as a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] with respect to the Zariski [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] $\mathcal{G}_{Zar}$. See the examples at [[derived scheme]] for more details on this.

###### Proposition ([[Structured Spaces|StSp]], 4.2.9)

Let $Sch_{\leq 0}^{\leq 0}(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}) \subset Sch(\mathcal{G}_{Zar})$ be the full subcategory of all [[derived scheme]]s on the [[n-truncated structured (infinity,1)-topos|0-trucated]] and [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|0-localic]] ones. This is canonically equivalent to the ordinary category $Sch(k)$ of schemes over $k$:

$$
  Sch_{\leq 0}^{\leq 0}(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k))
  \simeq
  Sch(k)
  \,.
