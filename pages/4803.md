## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] the term _gravitino_ refers to the [[supersymmetry|superpartner]] of the [[graviton]], a [[Rarita-Schwinger field]] of [[spin]] $3/2$ that appears in [[supergravity]].

In [[supergravity]] a field configuration is a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] locally given by a  [[Lie algebra-valued form]]

$$
  (E, \Omega, \Spi) : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(d,1)
$$

on [[spacetime]] with values in the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]]. Its components $\Psi$ in the [[spin group]] [[representation]] $\Gamma \subset \mathfrak{siso}(d)$ is the **gravitino** field.

The name derives from the fact that the other two comonents are identified in [[gravity]] with the [[graviton]] field.
