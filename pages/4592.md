## Idea

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], $ v \in \Gamma(T X)$ a [[vector field]] and $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(X)$ a [[differential form]] on $X$, the **Lie derivative** $\mathcal{L}_v \omega$ of $\omega$ along $v$ is the linearization of the pullback of $\omega$ along the flow $\exp(v -) : \mathbb{R} \times X \to X$ induced by $v$

$$
  \mathcal{L}_v \omega = \frac{d}{d t}|_{t = 0} \exp(v t)^*(\omega)
  \,.
$$

By [[Cartan's magic formula]] we have that for $\iota_v : \Omega^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^{\bullet -1}(X)$ the graded [[derivation]] obtained by contraction with $v$ that

$$
  \mathcal{L}_v = [d_{dR}, \iota_v] = d_{dR} \circ \iota_v + \iota_v \circ d_{dR} : \Omega^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$
