## Idea

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $M$ and a vector field $X \in \Gamma(T M)$ on it, one defines a series of operators $\mathcal{L}_X$ on spaces of differential forms, of functions, of vector fields and multivector fields. 
For functions $\mathcal{L}_X(f) = X(f)$ (derivative of $f$ along an integral curve of $X$); as multivector fields and forms can not be compared in different points, one pullbacks or pushforwards them to be able to take a derivative. 


For vector fields $\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X,Y]$. If $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(M)$ is a [[differential form]] on $M$, the **Lie derivative** $\mathcal{L}_X \omega$ of $\omega$ along $X$ is the linearization of the pullback of $\omega$ along the flow $\exp(X -) : \mathbb{R} \times M\to M$ induced by $X$

$$
  \mathcal{L}_X \omega = \frac{d}{d t}|_{t = 0} \exp(t X)^*(\omega)
  \,.
$$
Denote by $\iota_X : \Omega^\bullet(M) \to \Omega^{\bullet -1}(M)$ be the graded [[derivation]] which is the [[contraction]] with a vector field $X$. By [[Cartan's homotopy formula]], 

$$
  \mathcal{L}_v = [d_{dR}, \iota_v] = d_{dR} \circ \iota_v + \iota_v \circ d_{dR} : \Omega^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$
