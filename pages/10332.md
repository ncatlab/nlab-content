On [[mathematics]] as the language of [[physics]]:

> {#TheBookOfnature} [[natural philosophy|Philosophy]] $[$i.e. [[natural philosophy]], i.e. [[physics]] $]$ is written in this grand book &#8212; I mean the universe &#8212; which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of [[mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. ([Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer)).
