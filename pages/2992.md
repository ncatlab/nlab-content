The [[field]] of **rational numbers**, denoted $\mathbb{Q}$, is the [[field of fractions]] of the [[commutative ring]] of [[integer]]s, $\mathbb{Z}$.

There are several interesting [[topological space|topologies]] on $\mathbb{Q}$ that make $\mathbb{Q}$ into a [[topological group]] under addition, allowing us to define interesting fields by taking the [[completion]] with respect to this topology:
1.  The _[[discrete topology]]_ is the most obvious, which is already complete.
2.  The _absolute-value topology_ is defined by the [[metric space|metric]] $d(x,y) \coloneqq |x - y|$; the completion is the field of [[real numbers]].
3.  Fixing a [[prime number]] $p$, the _$p$-adic topology_ is defined by the [[ultrametric]] $d(x,y) \coloneqq 1/n$ where $n$ is the highest exponent on $p$ in $x$ or $y$; the completion is the field of $p$-[[adic number]]s.

Interestingly, (2) cannot be interpreted as a [[locale|localic]] group, although the completion $\mathbb{R}$ can.  (Probably the same holds for (3); I need to check.)
