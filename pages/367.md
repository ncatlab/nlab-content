## Idea

A _simplicial object_ $X$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an _[[simplicial set]]_ [[internalization|internal]] to $C$: a collection $\{X_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[objects]] in $C$ that behave as if $X_n$ were an object of $n$-dimensional [[simplices]] [[internalization|internal to]] $C$ equipped with maps between these space that assign faces and degenerate simplices.

For instance, and there is a longer list further down this page, a simplicial object in $Grps$ is a collection $\{G_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of groups, together with face and degeneracy _homomorphisms_ between them. This is just a [[simplicial group]]. We equally well have other important instances of the same idea, when we replace $Grps$ by other categories, or higher categories.


## Definition

A **simplicial object** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[functor]] $\Delta^{op} \to C$, where $\Delta$ is the [[simplex category|simplicial indexing category]].

More generally, a simplicial object in an [[(∞,1)-category]] is an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $\Delta^{op} \to C$.

A **cosimplicial object** in $C$ is similarly a functor out of the [[opposite category]], $\Delta \to C$.

Accordingly, simplicial and cosimplicial objects in $C$ themselves form a [[category]] in an obvious way, namely the [[functor category]] $[\Delta^{op},C]$ and $[\Delta,C]$, respectively.

**Remark**

A **simplicial object** $X$ in $C$ is often specified by 
the objects, $X_n$, which are the images under $X$, of the objects $[n]$ of $\Delta$, together with a description of the face and degeneracy morphisms, $d_i$ and $s_j$, which must satisfy the [[simplicial identities]].

## Category of simplicial objects

For $D$ a [[category]], we write $D^{\Delta^{op}}$ for the [[functor category]] from $\Delta^{op}$ to $D$: its category of simplicial objects.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $D$ be a [[nLab:category]] with all [[nLab:limit]]s and [[nLab:colimit]]s. This implies that it is [[nLab:copower|tensored]] over [[nLab:Set]]

$$
  \cdot : D \times Set \to D
  \,.
$$

This induces a functor

$$
  \cdot^{\Delta^{op}} : D^{\Delta^{op}} \times sSet \to D^{\Delta^{op}}
$$

which we shall also write just "$\cdot$".

For $X,Y \in D^{\Delta^{op}}$ write

$$
  D^{\Delta^{op}}(X,Y) := Hom_{D^{\Delta^{op}}}(X \cdot \Delta[\bullet], Y)
  \in sSet
$$

and for $X,Y,Z \in D^{\Delta^{op}}$ let

$$
  D^{\Delta^{op}}(X,Y)
    \times  
  D^{\Delta^{op}}(Y,Z)
  \to 
  D^{\Delta^{op}}(X,Z)
$$

be given in degree $n$ by

$$
  (X \cdot \Delta[n] \to Y, Y \cdot \Delta[n] \to Z)
  \mapsto
  ( X \cdot \Delta[n] \to X \cdot \Delta[n]\times \Delta[n] \to Y \cdot \Delta[n]  \to Z)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

With the above definitions $D^{\Delta^{op}}$ becomes an [[nLab:sSet]]-[[nLab:enriched category]] which is both [[nLab:copower|tensored]] as well as [[nLab:power|cotensored]] over $sSet$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

We may regard the category of cosimplicial objects $D^{\Delta}$ as an $sSet$-enriched category using the above enrichment by identifying

$$
  D^{\Delta} \simeq ({D^{op}}^{\Delta^{op}})^{op}
  \,.
$$
