###### Definition

A _(linear) complex structure_ on a [[vector space]] $V$ is an [[automorphism]] $J : V \to V$ that squares to minus the [[identity]]: $J \circ J = - Id$.

More generally, an almost complex structure on a [[smooth manifold]] is a smoothly varying [[fiber]]wise complex structure on its [[tangent spaces]]:

###### Definition

An _almost complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ (of even [[dimension]]) is a rank $(1,1)$-[[tensor field]] $J$, hence a smooth [[section]] $J \in \Gamma(T X \otimes T^* X)$, such that, over each point $x \in X$, $J$ is a linear complex structure, def. \ref{LinearComplexStructure}, on that [[tangent space]] $T_x X$ under the canonical identification $End T_x X \simeq T_x X\otimes T_x^* X$.

###### Definition

An _almost complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $2 n$ is a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[tangent bundle]] to the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[general linear group]] along $GL(n,\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$.

###### Remark

In terms of modulating maps of bundles into their [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stacks]], this means that an almost complex structure is a lift in the following [[diagram]] in [[Smooth∞Grpd]]:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} GL(n,\mathbb{C})
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{alm.compl.str.}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    X
    &\underoverset{\tau}{tang.\,bund.}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B} GL(2n,\mathbb{R})
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that by further [[reduction of the structure group|reduction]] along the [[maximal compact subgroup]] inclusion of the [[unitary group]] this yields explicitly a unitary/hermitean vector bundle structure

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} U(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{herm.alm.compl.str.}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    X
    &\underoverset{\tau}{tang.\,bund.}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B} GL(2n,\mathbb{R})
  }
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A _complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is the structure of a [[complex manifold]] on $X$. Every such defines  an almost complex structure and almost complex structures arising this way are called _integrable_  (see at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_).

## Properties

### Characterizations of integrability

The _[[Newlander-Nirenberg theorem]]_ states that an almost complex structure $J$ on a smooth manifold is integrable (see also at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_) precisely if its [[Nijenhuis tensor]] vanishes, $N_J = 0$.



### Relation to $Spin^c$-structures

Every almost complex structure canonically induces a [[spin^c-structure]] by postcomposition with the universal [[characteristic map]] $\phi$ in the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}U(n) &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}& \mathbf{B}Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    &\searrow& \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}SO(2n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.
$$

See at _[[spin^c-structure]]_ for more.

### Relation to Hermitian and Kähler structure

* An almost complex structure equipped with a compatible [[Riemannian metric]] is a _[[Hermitian structure]]_.

* An almost complex structure equipped with a compatible [[Riemannian structure]] and [[symplectic structure]] is a _[[Kähler structure]]_.
