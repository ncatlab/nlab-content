## Definition

A _(linear) complex structure_ on a [[vector space]] $V$ is an [[automorphism]] $J : V \to V$ that squares to minus the identity: $J \circ J = - Id$.

An _almost complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is a smooth [[section]] $J \in \Gamma(T X \otimes T^* X)$ such that, over each point $x \in X$, $J$ is a linear complex structure on that [[tangent space]] $T_x X$ under the canonical identification $End T_x X \simeq T_x X\otimes T_x^* X$. Equivalently this is a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[tangent bundle]] to the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[general linear group]] along $GL(n,\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$.

A _complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is the structure of a [[complex manifold]] on $X$. Every such defines  an almost complex structure and almost complex structures arising this way are called _integrable_ .

## Properties

### Characterizations of integrability

The _Newlander-Nierenberg theorem_ states that an almost complex structure $J$ on a smooth manifold is integrable precisely if its [[Nijenhuis tensor]] vanishes, $N_J = 0$.

### Relation to $Spin^c$-structures

Every alomost complex structure canonically induces a [[spin^c-structure]]. See there for more.
