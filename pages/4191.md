## Idea ##
There are several different concepts of [[tensor products]] for [[C-star algebras]], because there are different norms one can put on the algebraic tensor product that turns it into a [[C-star algebra]]. The spatial tensor product uses the smallest norm of all possible norms. There is also a maximal norm and it is a nontrivial theorem that all norms fall in between these two.

## Definition ##
Let $\mathcal{A}_1, ..., \mathcal{A}_k$ be unital $C^*$-algebras faithfully represented on the [[Hilbert spaces]] $H_1, ..., H_k$. Let $H$ be the tensor product of these Hilbert spaces,
$$
H := \otimes_{i=1}^k H_k 
$$
The set of operators of finite sums of $A_1 \otimes ... \otimes_k A_k$ form a $*$-subalgebra of $\mathcal{B}(H)$. The norm closure of this set is the **spatial tensor product** of the given $C^*$-algbras.

Remark: The spatial tensor product does not depend on the chosen faithful representations, see references.

###### Theorem

**states extend to the spatial tensor product**

Let $\rho_1, ..., \rho_k$ be states on the unitary $C^*$-algebras. Then there is a unique state $\rho$ on the spatial tensor product such that
$$
\rho(A_1 \otimes ... \otimes_k A_k) = \rho_1(A_1) \cdots \rho_k(A_k)
$$
