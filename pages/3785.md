## Idea

A **Grothendieck's existence problem** is a question of [[representable functor|representability]] of a [[presheaf]] of sets (or sometimes of groups) on the [[category]] of [[affine schemes]] (or some variant of it) as a [[scheme]] (or as an [[algebraic space]], [[Deligne-Mumford stack]] or some other algebraic variant of a space making the representability problem nontrivial...). In early days of [[scheme]] theory, at the end of 1950-s Grothendieck proved several major positive results of this sort, like the constructions of Hilbert, [[Quot scheme|Quot]] and Picard schemes, and the **Grothendieck's existence theorem** in [[formal geometry]] with major applications in [[deformation theory]]. Another major result of that sort is the [[Artin's representability theorem]] (and its refined version in [[higher geometry]], the [[Artin-Lurie representability theorem]]).
