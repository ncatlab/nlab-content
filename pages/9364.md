## Idea

A *polynomial monad* is a [[monad]] whose underlying [[endofunctor]] is a [[polynomial functor]]. This is of course equivalent to being a monad in the category of polynomial functors.

## Examples

A basic example is the free-monoid monad ([Gambino-Kock 09, Example 1.9](#GambinoKock09)). This is exhibited by the polynomial $1\leftarrow \mathbb{N}^\prime\rightarrow  \mathbb{N}\rightarrow 1$ where the middle arrow is such that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ its fiber over $n$ has cardinality $n$.

One can construct the free monad on a polynomial endofunctor.
