An [[object]] being **finitely presentable** or **of finite presentation** is the same as it being a [[compact object]]. See there for more details.

There is nothing there about the [[finitely presented objects]] that I know from algebra, such as finitely presented groups.  What is the connection?  ---[[Toby Bartels]]

The term "finitely presentable" or "finitely-presentable" is used for instance in

* Kashiwara, Schapira, [[Categories and Sheaves]], Definition 6.3.2;
* [[Peter Johnstone]], [[Stone Spaces]], Definition VI.1.8.
