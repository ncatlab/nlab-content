The [[Sierpinski space]] $S$ is the set {0,1} of [[truth values]] with the topology in which {1} is closed but not open. This space is a classifier for  closed subspaces of a topological space $X$ in that for any closed subspace $C$ of $X$ there is a unique continuous function $\chi_A: X \to S$ such that $A= \chi_A^{-1}(1)$. Hence one gets a topology on the set of closed subsets of $X$ by identifying this set with $Top(X,S)$ for a suitable function space topology.
