Negative thinking is a way of thinking about [[vertical categorification|categorification]] by considering what the original concept is a categorification of.  That is, to better understand how foos are categorified to become $2$-foos, $3$-foos, and so on, you think about how foos are themselves a categorification of $0$-foos, $(-1)$-foos, and so on.  Generally, the concept of $n$-foo stops making sense for small values of $n$ after a few steps, but it does make sense surprisingly often for at least some non-positive values.  Experienced negative thinkers can compete to see 'how low can you go'.

More generally, negative thinking can apply whenever you have a sequence of mathematical objects and ask yourself what came before the beginning?  Examples outside [[category theory]] include the $(-1)$-[[sphere]] and the $(-1)$-[[simplex]] (which are both [[empty set|empty]]), although maybe it means something that these are both from [[homotopy theory]].  [[Tim Gowers]] has called this '[generalizing backwards](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2007/09/19/one-way-of-looking-at-cauchys-theorem/)'.

For low values of $n$-[[n-category|category]], see Section 2 of [[Lectures on n-Categories and Cohomology]].  Related issues appear at [[category theory vs order theory]].  See also nearly any page here with '0' or '(-1)' in the title, such as 

* [[0-category]]
* [[(-1)-category]]
* [[(-2)-category]]
* [[0-poset]]
* [[(-1)-poset]]
* [[0-groupoid]]
* [[(-1)-groupoid]]
* [[(-2)-groupoid]]
