## Idea

A *locally connected site* is a [[site]] satisfying sufficient conditions to make its [[topos of sheaves]] into a [[locally connected topos]].


## Definition

Let $C$ be a small [[site]]; we say it is a **locally connected site** if all covering [[sieves]] of any object $U\in C$ are [[connected category|connected]], as full subcategories of the [[slice category]] $C/U$.  (In particular, this means that all covering families are [[inhabited set|inhabited]].)

###### Proposition

If $C$ is a locally connected site, then the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(C)$ is a [[locally connected topos]]. 

=--

This means that the [[inverse image functor]] $L Const\colon Set \to Sh(C)$ has a [[left adjoint]] $\Pi_0$.  

To see this, notice 

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

If $C$ is locally connected, then every constant presheaf on $C$ is a [[sheaf]].  

=--

Using this, we have

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The constant *[[presheaf]]* functor $Const \colon Set \to Psh(C)$ has a left adjoint given by taking [[colimit]]s along $C^{op}$ (this is one of the equivalent _definitions_ of the colimit operatiion.) Since constant presheaves on $C$ are sheaves, $L Const$ is just a factorization of $Const$ through $Sh(C)$, and thus it also has a left adjoint given by the colimit operation.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

The colimit over a [[representable functor]] is always the singleton set. 

So for $X \in Sh(C)$ any sheaf, we may write it, using the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] as a [[coend]] over representables

$$
  X = \int^{U \in C} X(U) \cdot U
  \,.
$$

The left adjoint functor $\Pi_0$ commutes with the coend and the [[tensoring]] in the integrand to produce

$$
  \Pi_0(X) = \int^{U \in C} X(U) \cdot {*} = colim_{U \to X} {*}
  \,.
$$

We may think of this as computing the set of _plot-connected components_ of $X$.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation


If $C$ furthermore has a [[terminal object]], then colimits along $C^{op}$ preserve the [[terminal object]], so that $Sh(C)$ is moreover a [[connected topos]].

=--

Note that a non-locally-connected site can still give rise to a locally connected topos of sheaves, but every locally connected topos can be defined by *some* locally connected site.

## Examples

* any small subcategory of [[Top]] on [[connected]] topological spaces (with the standard [[open cover]] [[coverage]]).
