## Idea

Full [[quantum field theory]] is sometimes called -- for emphasis and in contrast to its approximation by [[perturbation theory]] -- _non-perturbative quantum field theory_ .

## Related concepts


* [[non-perturbative effect]]

* [[instanton]]

* [[superselection sector]]

* [[non-perturbative string theory]]
