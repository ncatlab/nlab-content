Jeff Giansiracusa is a proefssor at Swansea University in the Department of Mathematics. He has worked on [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] aspects of [[moduli space]]s, [[operad]]s, [[topological field theory]], and [[diffeomorphism group]]s, using [[topology|topological]] techniques from [[algebraic K-theory]] to study the [[homotopy theory]] of moduli spaces arising in [[algebraic geometry]] and now includes aspects of [[topological data analysis]], [[tropical geometry]], matroids, idempotent algebra, and non-archimedean geometry in his research interests.
