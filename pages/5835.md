Jeff Giansiracusa is an EPSRC funded research fellow at Swansea University in the Department of Mathematics. He works on [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] aspects of [[moduli space]]s, [[operad]]s, [[topological field theory]], and [[diffeomorphism group]]s, using [[topology|topological]] techniques from [[algebraic K-theory]] to study the [[homotopy theory]] of moduli spaces arising in [[algebraic geometry]].
