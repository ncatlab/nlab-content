Jacobian varieties are the most important class of abelian varieties. 

To every nonsingular algebraic curve $C$ (over the complex numbers) of genus $g$ one associates the Jacobian variety or simply Jacobian $J(C)$
either via differential 1-forms or equivalently via line bundles: Jacobian is the the moduli space of degree $0$ line bundles over $C$, i.e. the connected component of the identity of the [[Picard group]] of $C$.

The __Abel-Jacobi map__ $C\to J(C)$ is defined with help of periods.

(one should also cover Abel-Jacobi theorem)
