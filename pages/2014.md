A [[topological space]] is __noetherian__ if it satisfies the _ascending chain condition_ for inclusions of open sets. Equivalently, it satisfies the _descending chain condition_ for inclusions of closed sets. 

Typical examples are the underlying topological spaces of (classical) quasiprojective varieties over a field $k$ in Zariski topology. The fact that the affine space $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ is noetherian is a consequence of the [Hilbert basis theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_basis_theorem). 

Every noetherian topological space is a closed union of a finitely many [[irreducible topological spaces]] (its irreducible components).
