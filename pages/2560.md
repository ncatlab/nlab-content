Let $S : \Delta^{op} \to Set$ be a [[simplicial set]].

The **spine** of an $n$-[[simplex]] $\sigma \in S_n$, also called its **backbone**, consists of the edges $0 \to 1$, $1 \to 2$, $\cdots$ , $(n-1) \to n$ between the successive vertices of $\sigma$. 

When $n \gt 2$, an $(n,i)$-[[horn]] in $S$ has the same edges as any of its fillers, so we may speak of the spine of a $horn$ as well. 

#Interpretation in terms of higher categories#

If $S$ is a [[Kan complex]] or [[quasi-category]], then 
the spine of $\sigma$ is the maximal list of _composable_ edges ([[k-morphism|1-morphism]]s) of $\sigma$.
