**Definition**

An **associative ring spectrum** or [[A-infinity ring]] is an [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|algebra object in]] the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] with its [[smash product of spectra]] [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal structure]].

#Remarks#

* A commutative associative ring spectrum is a [[commutative ring spectrum]] or [[E-infinity ring]].

the $(\infty,1)$-categorical description of associative ring spectra is in section 4.3 of
