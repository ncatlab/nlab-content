In physical applications, a differential manifold $M$ is often used to parametrize the possible positions of particles in a system. In such [[models]], $M$ is often called the "position space". 

Manifolds and bundles which are derived from $M$ also receive convenient names. The tangent bundle $TM$ is called the "configuration space", since the configuration of the system is specifying positions and velocity vectors. The cotangent bundle $T^* M$ is called the "phase space" (why?).

A partial list follows.

| Manifold  | Manifold Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $M$ | Position Space |
| $TM$ | Configuration Space |
| $T^* M$ | Phase Space |
