### Idea ###

The smooth loop space of a smooth manifold, say $M$, is the space of smooth maps from the circle, $S^1$, to $M$.  It can be given the structure of an infinite dimensional Fr&eacute;chet manifold.

By extending the idea of a manifold to that of a [[generalized smooth space]], smooth loop spaces can be viewed as the result of applying the internal hom-functor with the circle as the source.
