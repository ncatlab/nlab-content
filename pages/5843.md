
This entry is about the notion of a residue field in [[algebraic geometry]]. There is another (related) notion of a residue field in [[constructive mathematics]]; see under [[field]].

Given a [[local ring]] $R$, by the definition there is a [[maximal ideal]] $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$. The quotient $R/\mathfrak{m}$ is therefore a [[division ring]], and in commutative case, therefore a [[field]], called the residue field. In algebraic geometry, the __residue field__ at a point $x$ of a scheme $X$ is the residue field of the corresponding stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ of the structure sheaf, which is by the definition a local ring.
