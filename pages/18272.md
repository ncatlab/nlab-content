###### Proposition
**(images preserve [[unions]] but not in general [[intersections]])**

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[function]] between [[sets]]. Let $\{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[subsets]] of $X$. Then 

1. $im_f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cup}  S_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cup} im_f(S_i)\right)$ (the [[image]] under $f$ of a [[union]] of subsets is the union of the images)

1. $im_f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i\right) \subset \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} im_f(S_i)\right)$ (the [[image]] under $f$ of the [[intersection]] of the subsets is contained in the intersection of the images).

The [[injective function|injection]] in the second item is in general proper. If $f$ is an [[injective function]] then this is a [[bijection]]:

* $(f\,\text{injective}) \Rightarrow \left(im_f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} im_f(S_i)\right)\right)$

## Proofs via adjoints 

The properties 1., 2. of Proposition \ref{PreservationOfUnionsAndIntersectionsOfSets} may be proved by appeal to fundamental relationships between [[direct image]] and [[inverse image]] and the like, which category theorists call [[adjunctions]] (not unlike adjoints in linear algebra). The advantage of this type of proof is that, despite its utter simplicity, it generalizes to much wider contexts (beyond elementary classical set theory). 

The first such relationship is that, for all subsets $S \subseteq X$ and $T \subseteq Y$, we have 

$$f(S) \subseteq T \qquad iff \qquad S \subseteq f^{-1}(T)$$ 

In that case, we have the following elementary inferences: 

$$\array{
\bigcup_{i \in I} f(S_i) \subseteq T & iff & (\forall_{i \in I})\; f(S_i) \subseteq T \\ 
 & iff & (\forall_{i \in I})\; S_i \subseteq f^{-1}(T) \\ 
 & iff & \bigcup_{i \in I} S_i \subseteq f^{-1}(T) \\ 
 & iff & f\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i\right) \subseteq T
}$$ 

where the first and third lines use the defining [[universal property|property]] of unions. Then, putting $T = \bigcup_{i \in I} f(S_i)$ and reasoning forward, we get $f\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i\right) \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} f(S_i)$. On the other hand, putting $T = f\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i\right)$ and reasoning backward, we get $\bigcup_{i \in I} f(S_i) \subseteq f\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i\right)$. These two inclusions together give $\bigcup_{i \in I} f(S_i) = f\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i\right)$. 

The [[duality|dual]] of this proof immediately gives the fact that inverse images preserve arbitrary intersections, but let us spell it out directly: 

$$\array{
S \subseteq \bigcap_{i \in I} f^{-1}(T_i) & iff & (\forall_{i \in I})\; S \subseteq f^{-1}(T_i) \\ 
 & iff & (\forall_{i \in I})\; f(S) \subseteq T_i \\ 
 & iff & f(S) \subseteq \bigcap_{i \in I} T_i \\ 
 & iff & S \subseteq f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i \in I} T_i \right)
}$$ 

and again by using the reasoning forward/backward trick, we infer $\bigcap_{i \in I} f^{-1}(T_i) = f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i \in I} T_i\right)$.

###### Remark 
The "reasoning forward/backward trick" may be summarized by saying that in a [[poset]], we have $A = B$ iff ($A \leq T \Leftrightarrow B \leq T$), or dually that $A = B$ iff ($S \leq A \Leftrightarrow S \leq B$). This trick is vastly extrapolated by the [[Yoneda lemma]].
