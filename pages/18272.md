###### Proposition
**(images preserve [[unions]] but not in general [[intersections]])**

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[function]] between [[sets]]. Let $\{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[subsets]] of $X$. Then 

1. $im_f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cup}  S_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cup} im_f(S_i)\right)$ (the [[image]] under $f$ of a [[union]] of subsets is the union of the images)

1. $im_f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i\right) \subset \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} im_f(S_i)\right)$ (the [[image]] under $f$ of the [[intersection]] of the subsets is contained in the intersection of the images).

The [[injective function|injection]] in the second item is in general proper. If $f$ is an [[injective function]] then this is a [[bijection]]:

* $(f\,\text{injective}) \Rightarrow \left(im_f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} im_f(S_i)\right)\right)$
