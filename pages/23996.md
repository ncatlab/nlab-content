## Idea

*Persistent cohomotopy* (not yet an established term) would be the study of [[cohomotopy]] in situations where the [[domain]] [[topological space|space]] and/or its [[continuous function|map]] to an [[n-sphere]] may depend on a parameter to yield not just a single [[cohomotopy set]], but a [[filtered object|filtered]] set (a filtered [[group]] when the [[dimension of a cell complex|dimension]] of the domain space is large enough). One concrete implementation of this general notion is considered in [Franek & Krčál 2017](#FranekKrcal17), see [below](#Definition). 

In this context it has been shown ([Franek & Krčál 2016](#FranekKrcal16), [2017](#FranekKrcal17)) that persistent cohomotopy groups improve on the [[well groups]] used in [[persistent homology]] in ways that are practically relevant notably in [[topological data analysis]]:

1. persistent cohomotopy can distinguish functions that are indistinguishable by their [[well groups]] ([FK16, Sec. 1.2](#FranekKrcal16)),

1. even though coarser than cohomotopy groups, well groups in general are not (or not known to be) algorithmically [[computability|computable]], while the cohomotopy groups are proven computable in a fair range of dimensions ([CKMSVW14](computational+topology#CKMSVW14)).

Generally, one may understand persistent cohomotopy both as the [[duality|dual]] of *[[persistent homotopy]]* as well as a [[non-abelian cohomology]]-version of the more widely considered notion of [[persistent homology]]:


| | coarse |  intermediate | fine  |
|--|--|--|--|
| **[[homology]]** | [[ordinary homology]] | [[generalized homology]] | [[homotopy groups|homotopy]] |
| **[[cohomology]]** | [[ordinary cohomology]] | [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology|generalized cohomology]] | [[cohomotopy]] |
|  |  |  |  | 
| **persistent homology** | [[persistent homology|persistent ordinary homology]] | persistent generalized homology | [[persistent homotopy]] |
| **persistent cohomology** | persistent ordinary cohomology | persistent generalized cohomology | [[persistent cohomotopy]] |

[Franek & Krčál 2017](#FranekKrcal17)

For 

* $X$ a [[topological space]],

* $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]],

* $r \in \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}$ a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]],

* $f \,\colon\, X \xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;\;\;} \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[continuous map]],

such that with

* $A_r \,\coloneqq\, f^{-1}\big( \mathbb{R}^n \setminus B_r \big) \;\xhookrightarrow{i_r}\; X\;$

we have that 

* $(X,A_r)$ is a [[CW-pair]] of [[dimension of a cell complex|dimension]] $dim(X) \leq 2n - 3$

consider the following induced [[exact sequence]] of [[cohomotopy]]-groups (where square brackets $[X,Y]$ denote the [[hom-set]] $Ho(X,Y)$ in the [[classical homotopy category]], hence [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]] $X \to Y$):

\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=small]
  \pi_{n-1}
  \big(
    X
  \big)
  \ar[r, "{ \iota_r^\ast}"]
  \ar[d, phantom, "{\coloneqq}"{rotate=-90}]
  &
  \pi_{n-1}
  \big(
    A 
  \big)
  \ar[d, phantom, "{\coloneqq}"{rotate=-90}]
  \ar[r, "{ \delta_r }"]
  &
  \pi_{n}
  \big(
    X
  \big)
  \ar[d, phantom, "{\coloneqq}"{rotate=-90}]
  \\
  \big[
    X
    ,\,
    S^{n-1}
  \big]
  \ar[r, "{ [\iota_r. S^{n-1}] }"]
  &
  \big[
    A
    ,\,
    S^{n-1}
  \big]
  \ar[r]
  &
  \big[
    X
    ,\,
    S^n
  \big]
\end{tikzcd}

$$
  \pi_p^{(f,r)}
  \big(
    X
  \big)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \pi_r
  \big(
    X/A_r
  \big)
$$
