## Idea

A __commutative $k$-algebra__ (with $k$ a [[field]] or at least a [[commutative ring]]) is an [[associative unital algebra]] over $k$ with commutative multiplication. There is a generalization of commutativity when applied to [[finitary monad]]s in $Set$, that is [[generalized rings]], as studied in [[Nikolai Durov|Durov's]] thesis.

__Commutative algebra__ is the subject studying commutative algebras. It is closely related and it is the main algebraic foundation of [[algebraic geometry]]. Some of the well-known classical theorems of the commutative algebra are the [[Hilbert basis theorem]] and [[Nullstellensatz]] and [[Krull's theorem]], as well as many results pertaining to [[syzygy|syzygies]], [[resultant]]s and [[discriminant]]s.
