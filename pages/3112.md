## Idea

A **multilimit** of a diagram $F\colon D\to C$ in a [[category]] $C$ is a (small) set $L$ of [[cones]] over $F$ such that any cone over $F$ factors uniquely through a unique element of $L$.  Of course, [[limits]] are precisely multilimits for which $L$ is a [[singleton]].

For example, the category of [[fields]] has no [[initial object]], but it has a multi-initial-object, namely the family of all [[prime field]]s.
