In [[logic]] and [[type theory]], a **numeral** is a [[term]] of canonical form which denotes a [[natural number]].  Generally, this means it is of the form

$$ s(s(\cdots s(s(0))\cdots )) $$

where $s$ is the [[successor]] operator.  Often, the numeral representing the natural number $n$ --- which is to say, the term with $s$ applied $n$ times to $0$ --- is denoted by $\underline{n}$.

Not every term of type $\mathbb{N}$ is a numeral; consider for instance $\underline{2}+\underline{2}$.  However, good formal systems have the property of [[canonicity]], which in this context means that every term of type $\mathbb{N}$ *computes to*, or is *provably equal to*, a numeral.  In our example, if $+$ is defined by [[recursion]], there is a sequence of [[beta-reduction]] steps leading from $\underline{2}+\underline{2}$ to $\underline{4}$.
