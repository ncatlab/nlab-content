In [[logic]] and [[type theory]], a **numeral** is a [[term]] of canonical form which denotes a [[natural number]].  Generally, this means it is of the form

$$ s(s(\cdots s(s(0))\cdots )) $$

where $s$ is the [[successor]] operator.  Often, the numeral representing the natural number $n$ --- which is to say, the term with $s$ applied $n$ times to $0$ --- is denoted by $\underline{n}$.

Not every term of type $\mathbb{N}$ is a numeral; consider for instance $\underline{2}+\underline{2}$.  However, good formal systems have the property of [[canonicity]], which in this context means that every term of type $\mathbb{N}$ in the initial (empty) [context](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/context#category_of_contexts_8) *computes to*, or is *provably [[equal]] to*, a numeral.  In our example, if $+$ is defined by [[recursion]], there is a sequence of [[beta-reduction]] steps leading from $\underline{2}+\underline{2}$ to $\underline{4}$.  (In a [[context]] with [[free variables]] of type $\mathbb{N}$, then of course there will be more terms of type $\mathbb{N}$, built out of these variables.)

If we add to such a formal system an [[axiom]] using an [[existential quantification|existential statement]], then this is equivalent to adding to the language an additional term for a natural number that is not (and may not provably be equal to) any canonical numeral.  For example, in $PA + \neg{Con(PA)}$ ([[Peano arithmetic]] plus the axiom that Peano arithmetic is [[inconsistent]]), we have the axiom
$$ \exists n, (n \vdash_{PA} \bot) ,$$
stating the existence of a number $n$ that is the [[Goedel numbering|GÃ¶del number]] of a [[proof]] in $PA$ of a [[falsehood]].  If we instead extend the language of $PA$ with a new symbol $&#x203b;$ and add the axiom
$$ &#x203b; \vdash_{PA} \bot ,$$
then (assuming that $PA$ and so $PA + \neg{Con(PA)}$ is in fact consistent) one can prove
$$ \underline{n} \neq &#x203b; $$
in this system for every natural number $n$, but one cannot prove
$$ \forall n,\, n \neq &#x203b; $$
(which is actually trivially refutable).
