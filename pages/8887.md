## Definition

In informal mathematical speech and writing, a **numeral** refers to any notation or terms which denotes a [[natural number]] directly.  Usually, in mathematics, this refers to [[decimal number|base ten place-value notation]], so that for instance $0$, $2$, $13$, and $890$ are numerals.

In the more formal world of [[logic]] and [[type theory]], a **numeral** generally means (e.g. [Martin-L&#246;f 73](#MartinLoef73)) a [[term]] whose type is a [[natural numbers type]] and which is of [[canonical form]].  The meaning of "canonical form" may vary with the formal theory, but with the usual presentation of the [[natural numbers]] as an [[inductive type]] generated by [[zero]] $0$ and the [[successor]] operation $s$, the numerals are the terms of the form

$$ s(s(\cdots s(s(0))\cdots )). $$

Often, the numeral representing the natural number $n$ --- which is to say, the term with $s$ applied $n$ times to $0$ --- is denoted by $\underline{n}$.  Thus, for instance, $\underline{2}$ means $s(s(0))$.  It is important to note that $\underline{2}$ is not (usually) a term *inside* the formal system being considered; it is a "meta-notation" which stands for the term $s(s(0))$.  (One might say that the underline converts *informal* numerals to *formal* ones.)  In particular, any statement which quantifies over a natural number $n$ that occurs in a term $\underline{n}$ can only be expressed in the [[metatheory]].

## Canonicity

Not every term of natural number type $\mathbb{N}$ is a numeral; consider for instance $\underline{2}+\underline{2}$.  However, good formal systems have the property of [[canonicity]], which in this context means that every term of type $\mathbb{N}$ *computes to*, or is *provably [[equal]] to*, a numeral.  In our example, if $+$ is defined by [[recursion]], there is a sequence of [[beta-reduction]] steps leading from $\underline{2}+\underline{2}$ to $\underline{4}$.  (Canonicity is about terms in the [[empty context]]; in a [[context]] with [[free variables]] of type $\mathbb{N}$, then of course there will be more terms of type $\mathbb{N}$, built out of these variables.)

If we add to such a formal system an [[axiom]] using an [[existential quantification|existential statement]], then this is equivalent to adding to the language an additional term for a natural number that is not (and may not provably be equal to) any canonical numeral.  For example, in $PA + \neg{Con(PA)}$ ([[Peano arithmetic]] plus the axiom that Peano arithmetic is [[inconsistent]]), we have the axiom
$$ \exists n, (n \vdash_{PA} \bot) ,$$
stating the existence of a number $n$ that is the [[Goedel numbering|Gödel number]] of a [[proof]] in $PA$ of a [[falsehood]].  If we instead extend the language of $PA$ with a new symbol $&#8251;$ and add the axiom
$$ &#8251; \vdash_{PA} \bot ,$$
then (assuming that $PA$ and so $PA + \neg{Con(PA)}$ is in fact consistent) one can prove
$$ \underline{n} \neq &#8251; $$
in this system for every natural number $n$, but one cannot prove
$$ \forall n,\, n \neq &#8251; $$
(which is actually trivially refutable).
