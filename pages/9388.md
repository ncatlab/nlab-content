## Idea

Uniform convergence spaces are simultaneously a generalisation of [[uniform spaces]] and a specialisation with [[extra structure]] of [[convergence spaces]].  That is, we have [[functors]]
$$ Unif \to Unif Conv \to Conv ,$$
both [[faithful functor|faithful]] and with $Unif \to Unif Conv$ also [[full functor|full]].  (Here we take the [[morphisms]] of $Unif Conv$ and $Unif$ to be the [[uniformly continuous maps]], while $Conv$ must use the [[continuous maps]].)


## Motivation

The [[uniform property|uniform properties]] of a [[metric space]] $X$ are determined entirely by the [[equivalence relation]] between [[infinite sequences]] through which sequences $a$ and $b$ are related iff the distance between them tends to zero:
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} {\|a_n - b_n\|} = 0 .$$

An analogous holds for a [[uniform space]] $X$ if one generalises from sequences to [[nets]].  However, the relevant equivalence relation is not (directly) between two arbitrary nets but rather between two nets with the same [[directed set]] as [[domain]].  (This is because the limit above refers to a single index $n$; if we changed this to the limit as $m, n \to \infty$ of ${\|a_m - b_n\|}$, then we would get a [[partial equivalence relation]] that applies only to [[Cauchy sequences]], and this would recover only the [[Cauchy structure]] and not the entire [[uniform structure]].)

Rather than speak of two nets with the same domain, let us speak equivalently of a single net in the [[cartesian square]] $X \times X$.  Then for a more manifestly [[size issue|small]] definition, let us speak of a [[filter]] on $X \times X$.  So a uniform convergence structure on a [[set]] $X$ will be a collection of filters on $X \times X$.  We will require this collection to satisfy certain properties; if we imposed enough properties, we could recover a definition of uniform space (or even of metrisable uniform space), but some less stringent requirements yield the definition of uniform convergence space below.


## Definitions

Let $X$ be an [[abstract set]], and let $U$ be a collection of [[filters]] on the [[cartesian square]] $X \times X$, called the __uniform filters__.  We will consider various properties of such a structure below.

A collection that satisfies (4,5,6,7) below is a __[[subbase]]__; a subbase that satisfies also (2,3) is a __base__; and a base that satisfies (1) is a __uniform convergence structure__.  If we have (6') instead of (6), then this is a __weak uniform convergence structure__.  If we drop (4), then we have a __quasiuniform convergence structure__.  Note that we really only need condition (7) to begin with (hence no condition at all in classical mathematics) to generate any of these structures.

A __uniform convergence space__ (possibly weak or quasiâ€‘) is a set $X$ equipped with such a structure.

Here are the relevant properties:

1.  _Isotone_:  If $F \subseteq G$ and $F$ is a uniform filter (where $G$ is also a filter on $X \times X$), then $G$ is uniform.

2.  _Proper_:  There is a uniform filter.  If (1) also holds, then we may equivalently say that the [[improper filter]] on $X \times X$ is uniform.  This is automatic if (6) holds but is independent of the other conditions; it *almost* follows from (6'), but only if $X$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

3.  _Filtered_:  If $F$ and $G$ are uniform filters, then there is a uniform filter contained in both $F$ and $G$.  If (1) also holds, then we may equivalently say that the [[intersection]] $F \cap G$ is uniform.

4.  _Symmetric_:  If $F$ is a uniform filter, then there is a uniform filter $G$ with the property that, whenever $R \in G$, its [[inverse relation|inverse]] (as a [[binary relation]] on $X$) $R^{-1}$ belongs to $F$.  If (1) also holds, then we may equivalently say that the filter $\{ R^{-1} \;|\; R \in F \}$ is uniform.

5.  _Transitive_:  If $F$ and $G$ are uniform filters, then there is a uniform filter $H$ with the property that, whenever $R \in H$, there are $S_1, \ldots, S_n \in F$ and $T_1, \ldots, T_n \in G$ (for some [[natural number]] $n$) such that $R \supseteq (S_1 \circ T_1) \cap \cdots \cap (S_n \circ T_n)$ (where $\circ$ indicates [[composition]] of [[binary relations]] on $X$).  If (1) also holds, then we may equivalently say that the filter generated by $\{ S \circ T \;|\; S \in F,\; T \in G \}$ is uniform.

6.  _Reflexive_:  There is a uniform filter $F$ with the property that each $R \in F$ is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] as a binary relation on $X$.  If (1) also holds, then we may equivalently say that the collection of all reflexive relations (which is a filter) is uniform.

Although (6) as given here is in the original definition and is the proper nullary analogue of the binary (5), a weaker version is now more popular:

*  6'.  _Weakly reflexive_:  For every point $a$ of $X$, there is a uniform filter $F$ with the property that each $R \in F$ satisfies $(a,a) \in R$ (so that $R$ is reflexive at $a$).  If (1) also holds, then we may equivalently say that the collection of all relations reflexive at $a$ (which is a filter, indeed the [[principal ultrafilter]] at $(a,a)$) is uniform.

One reason for this is apparently to render the [[category]] of uniform convergence spaces [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].  So presumably there are uniform convergence spaces $X$ and $Y$ satisfying (6) such that the set of [[uniformly continuous maps]] from $X$ to $Y$ can be given only a weak uniform convergence structure.

For the purposes of [[constructive mathematics]], we should also consider another condition:

*  7.  _Comparison_:  If $F$ is a uniform filter, then there is a uniform filter $G$ with the property that, whenever $R \in G$, there is some $S \in F$ such that $\neg{R} \cup S = X \times X$.  Assuming [[excluded middle]], we may take $G$ to be $F$ itself (and take $S$ to be $R$), rendering this condition trivial in [[classical mathematics]].

It is traditional to consider only _[[proper filter|proper]]_ uniform filters, which allows one to leave out (2); but in that case (6) must be modified to apply only when $X$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

The conditions (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) correspond respectively to the conditions (6,4,5,2,3,1,0) at [[uniform space]] (as of 2013-02-22, in case the latter are ever renumbered).  However, (6') has no direct analogue.
