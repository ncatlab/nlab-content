## Idea

Uniform convergence spaces are simultaneously a generalisation of [[uniform spaces]] and a specialisation with [[extra structure]] of [[convergence spaces]].  That is, we have [[functors]]
$$ Unif \to Unif Conv \to Conv ,$$
both [[faithful functor|faithful]] and with $Unif \to Unif Conv$ also [[full functor|full]].  (Here we take the [[morphisms]] of $Unif Conv$ and $Unif$ to be the [[uniformly continuous maps]], while $Conv$ must use the [[continuous maps]].)
