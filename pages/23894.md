## Idea

The notion of an *internal antisymmetric relation* is the generalization of that of *[[antisymmetric relations]]* as one passes from the ambient [[category of sets]] [[internalization|into]] more general ambient  [[categories]] with suitable properties.

## Definitions

In a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, an **internal antisymmetric relation** is an [[internal relation]] $R\stackrel{(s,t)}\hookrightarrow X \times X$ on an object $X$ with a [[monomorphism]] $\alpha:R \times_X R^\op \hookrightarrow X$ into the [[diagonal subobject]] $X$, where $R \times_X R^\op$ is the [[pullback]] of the [[internal relation]] $(s,t)$ and its [[opposite internal relation]] $(t,s)$.
