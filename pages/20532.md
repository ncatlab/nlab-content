## Idea

Baire sets are certain [[subsets]] of a [[topological space]].  They form the Baire $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] of the space, and they play an important role in [[measure theory]].


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].  Then there is a $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] $\mathcal{B}$ on $X$ generated by the [[open subsets]] of $X$ that are preimages of $(0,\infty)$ under some continuous map $X\to\mathbf{R}$. Elements of $\mathcal{B}$ are called the __Baire sets__ (or __Baire subsets__, or __Baire-measurable sets__, etc) of $X$, and $\mathcal{B}$ itself is called the __Baire $\sigma$-algebra__ on $X$.


## Properties

The Baire $\sigma$-algebra is a $\sigma$-subalgebra of the [[Borel sigma-algebra|Borel σ-algebra]] since every continuous map is [[measurable function|measurable]]. Often both σ-algebras even coincide.
This holds for [[perfectly normal spaces]],
such as [[metric spaces]] or [[regular]] [[hereditary property|hereditary]] [[Lindelöf topological space|Lindelöf]] spaces.

When working with [[locally compact topological space|locally compact spaces]] one can often instead use the following fact ([Dudley, Theorem 7.3.1](#Dudley02)):

\begin{theorem}
Let $ K $ be a compact Hausdorff space and $ \mu $ any finite Baire measure thereon. Then $ \mu $ has a unique extension to a regular Borel measure on $ K $.
\end{theorem}
