## Idea

Baire sets are certain [[subsets]] of a [[topological space]].  They form the Baire $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] of the space, and they play an important role in [[measure theory]].


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].  Then there is a $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] $\mathcal{B}$ on $X$ generated by the [[open subsets]] of $X$ that are preimages of $(0,\infty)$ under some continuous map $X\to\mathbf{R}$. Elements of $\mathcal{B}$ are called the __Baire sets__ (or __Baire subsets__, or __Baire-measurable sets__, etc) of $X$, and $\mathcal{B}$ itself is called the __Baire $\sigma$-algebra__ on $X$.

The Baire $\sigma$-algebra is a $\sigma$-subalgebra of the [[Borel σ-algebra]] and sometimes coincides with it.
This holds for [[perfectly normal spaces]],
such as [[metric spaces]] or [[regular]] [[hereditary Lindelöf]] spaces.
