#Definition#

Given an [[internal category]] $C$ with object of objects $C_0$ and object of morphisms $C_1$, the **identity-assigning morphism** of $C$ is the morphism $i: C_0 \to C_1$ that is part of the definition of internal category.

This generalises the **identity-assigning function** of a [[small category]] $C$.  Given such a small category with set of objects $C_0$ and set of morphisms $C_1$, the **identity-assigning function** of $C$ is the function $i: C_0 \to C_1$ that maps each object in $C_0$ to its [[identity morphism]] in $C_1$.
