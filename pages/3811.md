## Idea

Physical [[observer]]s in [[spacetime]] seem to travel only slower than the [[speed of light]].  Mathematically, when we represent [[spacetime]] by a [[Lorentzian manifold]], the paths of physical observers must be _timelike_.  Our intuition is that travel along a timelike curve will always move either forwards or backwards in time (and it is the former that matches our subjective experience).  Na√Øvely, we may think that travelling along timelike curves prevents observers from engaging in time travel.

However, in principle it is quite possible for a time-like curve to be closed!  Locally, we are always travelling into the future when following such a curve (in the future-oriented direction), but after some time we find ourselves back where we started, in the past.  This is not possible in [[Minkowski space]], or indeed in any spacetime with a global time coordinate, but it is allowed under certain circumstances in [[general relativity]].

In science-fiction descriptions of time travel through wormholes, the time travelling follow a portion of a closed time-like curves (CTC) through the wormhole.  (However, this really only works for the you-can't-change-the-past sort of time travel, and science fiction rarely limits itself to that.)

See [[Lorentzian manifold]] for a precise mathematical definition.


## Physicality

As with any time travel, there are numerous paradoxes that arise when considering such curves and many physicists doubt their existence.
