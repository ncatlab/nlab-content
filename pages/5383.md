## Definition

A [[chain complex]] $A_\bullet$ is called

* **bounded above** if there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $A_k = 0$ for all $k \gt n$;

* **bounded below** if there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $A_k = 0$ for all $k \lt n$;

* **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below.

## Examples

* A [[connective chain complex]] is bounded from below.
