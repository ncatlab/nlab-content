## Idea

The Thom spectrum $M O$ is a [[connective spectrum]] whose associated [[infinite loop space]] is the [[classifying space]] for [[cobordism]]:

$$
\Omega^\infty M O \simeq B Cob_\infty.
$$

In particular, $\pi_n M O$ is naturally identified with the set of cobordism classes of closed $n$-manifolds.

## Definition

For $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]], we have a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  Th(\mathbb{R}^n \oplus V) \simeq S^n \wedge Th(V) \simeq \Sigma^n Th(V)
$$

of the [[Thom space]] (see there for details) of the [[direct sum]] with the trivial [[vector bundle]] of rank $n$ and the $n$-fold [[suspension]] of $V$.

###### Definition

For $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]], its **Thom spectrum** is the [[Omega spectrum]]

$$
  E_n := (X^V)_n = Th(\mathbb{R}^n \oplus V)
  \,.
$$

Without qualifiers, _the_ Thom spectrum is that of the universal vector bundles:

###### Definition

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let 

$$
  M O(n) := (B O)^{V(n)}
$$

be the Thom spectrum of the vector bundle $V(n)$ that is canonically [[associated bundle|associated]] to the $O(n)$-[[universal principal bundle]] $E O(n) \to B O(n)$ over the [[classifying space]] of the [[orthogonal group]] of dimension $n$.

The inclusions $O(n) \hookrightarrow O(n+1)$ induce a directed system of such spectra. The **Thom spectrum** is the [[colimit]]

$$
  M O := {\lim_\to}_n M O(n) 
  \,.
$$

## Properties

###### Proposition

The [[cobordism ring|cobordism group]] of un[[oriented]] $n$-[[dimension]]al [[manifold]]s is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the $n$th [[homotopy group]] of the Thom spectrum $M O$. That is, there is a natural isomorphism

$$
  \Omega^{un}_\bullet \simeq \pi_\bullet M O 
   :=
  {\lim_{\to}}_{k \to \infty} \pi_{n+k} M O(k)
  \,.
$$

This is a seminal result due to ([Thom](#Thom)), whose proof proceeds by the [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We first construct a map $\Theta : \Omega_n^{un} \to \pi_n M O$. (The presentation follows [Francis, lecture 3](#Francis3)).

Given a class $[X] \in \Omega_n^{un}$ we can choose a representative $X \in $ [[Diff]] and a [[closed embedding]] $\nu$ of $X$ into the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ of sufficiently large [[dimension]]. By the [[tubular neighbourhood theorem]] $\nu$ factors as the embedding of the [[zero section]] into the [[normal bundle]] $N_\nu$ followed by an [[open embedding]] of $N_\nu$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$

$$
  \array{
     X &&\stackrel{\nu}{\hookrightarrow}&& \mathbb{R}^{n+k}
     \\
     & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{i}}
     \\
     && N_\nu
  }
  \,.
$$

Now use the [[Pontrjagin-Thom construction]] to produce an element of the [[homotopy group]] first in the [[Thom space]] $Th(N_\nu)$ of $N_\nu$ and then eventually in $M O$.  To that end, let

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+k} \to (\mathbb{R}^{n+k})^+ \simeq S^{n+k}
$$

be the map into the [[one-point compactification]]. Define a map

$$
  t : S^{n+k} \simeq (\mathbb{R}^{n+k})^+ \to Disk(N_\nu)/Sphere(N_\nu) \simeq Th(N_\nu)
$$

by sending points in the image of $Disk(N_\nu)$ under $i$ to their preimage, and all other points to the collapsed point $Sphere(N_\nu)$. This defines an element in the [[homotopy group]] $\pi_{n+k}(Th(N_\nu))$.

To turn this into an element in the homotopy group of $M O$, notice that  since $N_\nu$ is a [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $k$, it is the [[pullback]] by a map $\mu$ of the universal rank $k$ vector bundle $\gamma_k \to B O(k)$

$$
  \array{
    N_\nu \simeq \mu^* \gamma_k &\to& \gamma_k
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\mu}{\to}& B O(k)
  }
  \,.
$$

By forming Thom spaces the top map induces a map

$$
  Th(N_\nu) \to Th(\gamma^k) =: M O(k)
  \,.
$$

Its composite with the map $t$ constructed above gives an element in $\pi_{n+k} M O(k)$

$$
  S^{n+k} \stackrel{t}{\to} Th(N_\nu) \to Th(\gamma^k) \simeq M O(k)
$$

and by $\pi_{n+k} M O(k) \to {\lim_\to}_k \pi_{n+k} M O(k) =: \pi_n M O$ this is finally  an element 

$$
  \Theta
  :
  [X]
   \mapsto
  (S^{n+k} \stackrel{t}{\to} Th(N_\nu) \to Th(\gamma^k) \simeq M O(k)) 
  \in
  \pi_n M O
  \,.
$$

We show now that this element does not depend on the choice of embedding $\nu : X \to \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$.

(...)

Finally, to show that $\Theta$ is an [[isomorphism]] by constructing an inverse.

For that,, observe that the [[sphere]] $S^{n+k}$ is a [[compact topological space]] and hence a [[compact object]] in [[Top]]. This implies that any map from $S^{n+k}$ into the [[filtered colimit]] 

$$
  Th(\gamma^k)  \simeq {\lim_\to}_s Th(\gamma^k_s)
  \,,
$$

where $\gamma^k_s \to Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^s)$ factors through one of the terms

$$
  f : S^{n+k} \to Th(\gamma^k_s)
  \,.
$$

By [[Thom's transversality theorem]] we may find an embedding $j : Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^s) \to Th(\Gamma^k_s)$ by a [[transverse map]] to $f$. Define then $X$ to be the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\to& Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^s)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    S^{n+k} &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Th(\gamma^k_s)
  }
  \,.
$$

We check that this construction provides an inverse to $\Theta$.

(...)

The [[homotopy equivalence]] $\Omega^\infty M O \simeq B Cob_\infty$ is the content of [[Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss theorem]], and is now seen as a part of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] theorem.

## Generalizations

Instead of the sequence of groups $O(n)$, one can consider $SO(n)$, or $Spin(n)$, $String(n)$, $Fivebrane(n)$,..., i.e., any level in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$. To any of these groups it corresponds a Thom spectrum, which is in turn related to oriented cobordism, spin cobordism, string cobordism, et cetera.

## Cohomology

Under the [[Brown representability theorem]] the Thom spectrum represents the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory called [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|cobordism cohomology theory]].
