## Idea

The Thom spectrum $M O$ is a [[connective spectrum]] whose associated [[infinite loop space]] is the [[classifying space]] for [[cobordism]]:

$$
\Omega^\infty M O \simeq \vert Cob_\infty \vert .
$$

In particular, $\pi_n M O$ is naturally identified with the set of cobordism classes of closed $n$-manifolds.

## Definition

### For vector bundles

For $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]], we have a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  Th(\mathbb{R}^n \oplus V) \simeq S^n \wedge Th(V) \simeq \Sigma^n Th(V)
$$

of the [[Thom space]] (see there for details) of the [[direct sum]] with the trivial [[vector bundle]] of rank $n$ and the $n$-fold [[suspension]] of $V$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]], its **Thom spectrum** is the [[Omega spectrum]]

$$
  E_n := (X^V)_n = Th(\mathbb{R}^n \oplus V)
  \,.
$$ 

=--

Without qualifiers, _the_ Thom spectrum is that of the universal vector bundles:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let 

$$
  M O(n) := (B O)^{V(n)}
$$

be the Thom spectrum of the vector bundle $V(n)$ that is canonically [[associated bundle|associated]] to the $O(n)$-[[universal principal bundle]] $E O(n) \to B O(n)$ over the [[classifying space]] of the [[orthogonal group]] of dimension $n$.

The inclusions $O(n) \hookrightarrow O(n+1)$ induce a directed system of such spectra. The **Thom spectrum** is the [[colimit]]

$$
  M O := {\lim_\to}_n M O(n) 
  \,.
$$

=--

Instead of the sequence of groups $O(n)$, one can consider $SO(n)$, or $Spin(n)$, $String(n)$, $Fivebrane(n)$,..., i.e., any level in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$. To any of these groups there corresponds a Thom spectrum, which is in turn related to oriented cobordism, spin cobordism, string cobordism, et cetera.

### For $(\infty,1)$-bundles

We discuss the Thom spectrum construction for general [[(∞,1)-vector bundle]]s.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is pair of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  (\Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty \dashv gl_1)
  : 
  Ho(E_\infty Rings)
   \stackrel{\overset{\Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{gl_1}{\to}}
  Ho(Spec_{con})
  \,,
$$

where $(\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty) : Spec \to Top$ is the [[stabilization]] adjunction between [[Top]] and [[Spec]] ($\Sigma^\infty$ forms the [[suspension spectrum]]), restricted to connective spectra, and $Ho(-)$ denotes [[homotopy categories]]. 

=--

This is ([ABGHR, theorem 2.1/3.2](#ABGHR)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Here $gl_1$ forms the "[[general linear group]]-of rank 1"-spectrum of an [[E-∞ ring]]: its "$\infty$-[[group of units]]". The adjunction is the generalization of the adjunction

$$
  (\mathbb{Z}[-] \dashv GL_1) : 
   CRing \stackrel{\overset{\mathbb{Z}[1]}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{GL_1}{\to}}
  Ab
$$

between [[CRing]] and [[Ab]], where $\mathbb{Z}[-]$ forms the [[group ring]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  b gl_1(R) := \Sigma gl_1(R)
$$

for the [[suspension]] of the group of units $gl_1(R)$. 

=--

This plays the role of the [[classifying space]] for $gl_1(R)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]]s. 

For $f : b \to b gl_1(R)$ a morphism (a [[cocycle]] for $gl_1(R)$-bundles) in [[Spec]], write $p \to b$ for the corresponding bundle: the [[homotopy fiber]]

$$
  \array{
     p &\to& * 
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     b &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b gl_1(R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Given a $R$-algebra $A$, hence an [[A-∞ algebra]] over $R$, exhibited by a morphism $\rho : R \to A$, the composite

$$
  \rho(f) : b \stackrel{f}{\to} b gl_1(R) \stackrel{\rho}{\to} b gl_1(A)
$$

is that for the corresponding [[associated ∞-bundle]].

We write capital letters for the underlying spaces of these spectra:

$$
  P := \Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty p
$$

$$
  B := \Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty b
$$

$$
  GL_1(R) := \Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty gl_1(R)
$$


+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralThomSpectrum}
###### Definition

The **Thom spectrum** $M f$ of $f : b \to gl_1(R)$ is the [[(∞,1)-pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty R &\to& R
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty p &\to& M f
  }
  \,,
$$

hence the [[derived functor|derived]] [[smash product]]

$$
  M f \simeq P \wedge_{GL_1(R)} R
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that a morphism $M f \to A$ is an $GL_1(R)$-equivariant map $P \to A$.

Notice that for $R = \mathbb{C}$ the [[complex number]]s, $B \to GL_1(R)$ is the cocycle for a [[circle bundle]] $P \to B$. A $U(1)$-equivariant morphism $P \to A$ to some [[representation]] $A$ is equivalently a [[section]] of the A-[[associated bundle]]. 

Therefore the Thom spectrum may be thought of as co-[[representable functor|representing]] spaces of sections of associated bundles

"$Hom(M f, A) \simeq \Gamma(P \wedge_{GL_1(R)} A)$".

=--

This is made precise by the following statement.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

We have an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    E_\infty Alg_R(M f, A) &\stackrel{}{\to}& (...)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{}{\to}& (...)
  }
$$

=--

This is ([ABGHR, theorem 2.10](#ABGHR)).

This definition does subsume the [above](ForSphereBundles) definition of Thom spectra for sphere  bundles (hence also that for vector bundles):

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $R = S$ be the [[sphere spectrum]]. Then for $f : b \to gl_1(S)$ a cocycle for an $S$-bundle, 

$$
  G := \Omega^\infty g : B \to B GL_1(S)
$$

is the classifying map for a [[spherical fibration]] over $B \in Top$. 

The Thom spectrum $M f$ of def. \ref{GeneralThomSpectrum} is equivalent to the Thom spectrum of the spherical fibration, according to def. \ref{ThomSpectrumForSphericalFibrations}.

=--

This is in ([ABGHR, section 8](#ABGHR)).

## Properties

### Relation to cobordism ring

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[cobordism ring|cobordism group]] of un[[oriented]] $n$-[[dimension]]al [[manifold]]s is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the $n$th [[homotopy group]] of the Thom spectrum $M O$. That is, there is a natural isomorphism

$$
  \Omega^{un}_\bullet \simeq \pi_\bullet M O 
   :=
  {\lim_{\to}}_{k \to \infty} \pi_{n+k} M O(k)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is a seminal result due to ([Thom](#Thom)), whose proof proceeds by the [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We first construct a map $\Theta : \Omega_n^{un} \to \pi_n M O$. (The presentation follows [Francis, lecture 3](#Francis3)).

Given a class $[X] \in \Omega_n^{un}$ we can choose a representative $X \in $ [[Diff]] and a [[closed embedding]] $\nu$ of $X$ into the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ of sufficiently large [[dimension]]. By the [[tubular neighbourhood theorem]] $\nu$ factors as the embedding of the [[zero section]] into the [[normal bundle]] $N_\nu$ followed by an [[open embedding]] of $N_\nu$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$

$$
  \array{
     X &&\stackrel{\nu}{\hookrightarrow}&& \mathbb{R}^{n+k}
     \\
     & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{i}}
     \\
     && N_\nu
  }
  \,.
$$

Now use the [[Pontrjagin-Thom construction]] to produce an element of the [[homotopy group]] first in the [[Thom space]] $Th(N_\nu)$ of $N_\nu$ and then eventually in $M O$.  To that end, let

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+k} \to (\mathbb{R}^{n+k})^+ \simeq S^{n+k}
$$

be the map into the [[one-point compactification]]. Define a map

$$
  t : S^{n+k} \simeq (\mathbb{R}^{n+k})^+ \to Disk(N_\nu)/Sphere(N_\nu) \simeq Th(N_\nu)
$$

by sending points in the image of $Disk(N_\nu)$ under $i$ to their preimage, and all other points to the collapsed point $Sphere(N_\nu)$. This defines an element in the [[homotopy group]] $\pi_{n+k}(Th(N_\nu))$.

To turn this into an element in the homotopy group of $M O$, notice that  since $N_\nu$ is a [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $k$, it is the [[pullback]] by a map $\mu$ of the universal rank $k$ vector bundle $\gamma_k \to B O(k)$

$$
  \array{
    N_\nu \simeq \mu^* \gamma_k &\to& \gamma_k
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\mu}{\to}& B O(k)
  }
  \,.
$$

By forming Thom spaces the top map induces a map

$$
  Th(N_\nu) \to Th(\gamma^k) =: M O(k)
  \,.
$$

Its composite with the map $t$ constructed above gives an element in $\pi_{n+k} M O(k)$

$$
  S^{n+k} \stackrel{t}{\to} Th(N_\nu) \to Th(\gamma^k) \simeq M O(k)
$$

and by $\pi_{n+k} M O(k) \to {\lim_\to}_k \pi_{n+k} M O(k) =: \pi_n M O$ this is finally  an element 

$$
  \Theta
  :
  [X]
   \mapsto
  (S^{n+k} \stackrel{t}{\to} Th(N_\nu) \to Th(\gamma^k) \simeq M O(k)) 
  \in
  \pi_n M O
  \,.
$$

We show now that this element does not depend on the choice of embedding $\nu : X \to \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$.

(...)

Finally, to show that $\Theta$ is an [[isomorphism]] by constructing an inverse.

For that,, observe that the [[sphere]] $S^{n+k}$ is a [[compact topological space]] and hence a [[compact object]] in [[Top]]. This implies that any map from $S^{n+k}$ into the [[filtered colimit]] 

$$
  Th(\gamma^k)  \simeq {\lim_\to}_s Th(\gamma^k_s)
  \,,
$$

where $\gamma^k_s \to Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^s)$ factors through one of the terms

$$
  f : S^{n+k} \to Th(\gamma^k_s)
  \,.
$$

By [[Thom's transversality theorem]] we may find an embedding $j : Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^s) \to Th(\Gamma^k_s)$ by a [[transverse map]] to $f$. Define then $X$ to be the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\to& Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^s)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    S^{n+k} &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Th(\gamma^k_s)
  }
  \,.
$$

We check that this construction provides an inverse to $\Theta$.

(...)

=--

The [[homotopy equivalence]] $\Omega^\infty M O \simeq \vert Cob_\infty \vert$ is the content of [[Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss theorem]], and is now seen as a part of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] theorem.


### As a dual in the stable homotopy category
 {#AsDualObject}

Write [[Spec]] for the category of [[spectra]] and $Ho(Spec)$ for its standard [[homotopy category]]: the [[stable homotopy category]]. By the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] this becomes a [[monoidal category]].

For $X$ any [[topological space]], we may regard it as an object in $Ho(Spec)$ by forming its [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$. We may ask under which conditions on $X$ this is a [[dualizable object]] with respect to the smash-product monoidal structure.

It turns out that a sufficient condition is that $X$ a closed [[smooth manifold]]. In that case $Th(N X)$ -- the Thom spectrum of its [[normal bundle|stable normal bundle]] is the corresponding [[dual object]]. This is called the [[Spanier-Whitehead dual]] of $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$.

Using this one shows that the [[trace]] of the identity on $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$ in $Ho(Spec)$ -- the categorical [[dimension]] of $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$ -- is the [[Euler characteristic]] of $X$.

This characterization is due to Dold.  It is mentioned as an example of traces in the expository ([PontoShulman, example 3.7](#PontoShulman)). For more see [[Spanier-Whitehead duality]].


## Cohomology

Under the [[Brown representability theorem]] the Thom spectrum represents the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory called [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|cobordism cohomology theory]].
