
In [[logic]], a __coherent formula__ is a [[proposition]] obtained from atomic ones by using finitary [[disjunction]] and [[conjunction]] ($\vee$, $\bottom$, $\wedge$, $\top$) and [[existential quantification]] over a [[finitely presented type]] ($\exists x\colon A$, for $A$ finitely presented). 

In particular, this *excludes* existential quantification over [[function types]] and [[power types]] (if these exist in the logic).
