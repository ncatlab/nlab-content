## Idea

A _$\dagger$-compact category_ is a category which is a 

* [[compact closed category]] 

and a

* [[symmetric monoidal †-category]] 

in a compatible way.  So, notably, it is a [[monoidal category]] in which

* every object has a dual;

* every morphism has an $\dagger$-adjoint.



## Definition

A category $C$ that is equipped with the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal †-category]] and is [[compact closed category|compact closed]] is **$\dagger$-compact** if the dagger-operation takes [[units]] of [[dual objects]] to [[counits]] in that for every object $A$ of $C$ we have

$$
  \array{
    && A \otimes A^*
    \\
    & {}^{\epsilon_A^\dagger}\nearrow
    \\
    I && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_{A \times A^*}}}
    \\
    & {}_{\eta_A}\searrow
    \\
    && A^* \otimes A
  }
  \,.
$$


## Examples

* The category of [[Hilbert spaces]] (over the [[complex numbers]]) with [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]] is a standard example of a $\dagger$-compact category.  This example is [[completeness theorem|complete]] for [[equation]]s in the language of $\dagger$-compact categories; see [Selinger 2012](#Selinger2012).


* For $C$ a category with [[finite limits]]  the category $Span_1(C)$ whose morphisms are [[span|spans]] in $C$ is $\dagger$-compact.  The $\dagger$ operation is that of relabeling the legs of a span as source and target.  The tensor product is defined using the cartesian product in $C$.   Every object $X$ is dual to itself with the unit and counit given by the span
$ X \stackrel{Id}{\leftarrow} X \stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to} X \times X$.

* The finite parts of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum computation]] are naturally formulated as the theory of $\dagger$-compact categories. For more on this see at _[[finite quantum mechanics in terms of †-compact categories]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to self-duality

If each [[object]] $X$ of a [[compact closed category]] is equipped with a [[self-duality]] structure $X \simeq X^\ast$, then sending morphisms to their [[dual morphisms]] but with these identifications pre- and postcomposed

$$
  (-)^\dagger \;\colon\; 
  (X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y)
  \mapsto
  (Y \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Y^\ast \stackrel{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow} X^\ast \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X)
$$

constitutes a dagger-compact category structure.

See for instance ([Selinger, remark 4.5](#Selinger)).

Applied for instance to the category of finite-dimensional [[inner product spaces]] this dagger-operation sends [[matrices]] to their [[transposed matrix]].
