## Idea

A _$\dagger$-compact category_ is a category which is a 

* [[compact closed category]] 

and a

* [[symmetric monoidal †-category]] 

in a compatible way.  So, notably, it is a [[monoidal category]] in which

* every object has a dual;

* every morphism has an $\dagger$-adjoint.

(Hence a $\dagger$-compact category is similar in flavor to an $(\infty,2)$-category with all adjoints in the sense of _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_ .)


## Definition

A category $C$ that is equipped with the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal †-category]] and is [[compact closed category|compact closed]] is **$\dagger$-compact** if the dagger-operation takes units of dual objects to counits in that for every object $A$ of $C$ we have
$$
  \array{
    && A \otimes A^*
    \\
    & {}^{\epsilon_A^\dagger}\nearrow
    \\
    I && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_{A \times A^*}}}
    \\
    & {}_{\eta_A}\searrow
    \\
    && A^* \otimes A
  }
  \,.
$$


## Examples

* For $C$ a category with [[finite limits]] 
the category $Span_1(C)$ whose morphisms are [[span|spans]] in $C$ is $\dagger$-compact.  The $\dagger$ operation is that of relabeling the legs of a span as source and target.  The tensor product is defined using the cartesian product in $C$.   Every object $X$ is dual to itself with the unit and counit given by the span
$ X \stackrel{Id}{\leftarrow} X \stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to} X \times X$.

## Quantum mechanics in terms of $\dagger$-compact categories

Large parts of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum computation]] are naturally formulated as the theory of $\dagger$-compact categories.
