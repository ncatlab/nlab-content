## Definition 

For a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the **sequence algebra** is the [[commutative algebra|commutative $R$-algebra]] $\mathbb{N} \to R$, with canonical injection $c:R \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$ which sends each element $r$ in $R$ to a [[constant function]] $c(r)$. The commutative algebra operations are pointwise defined as:

$$c(r)(n) \coloneqq r$$
$$0(n) \coloneqq 0$$
$$(x + y)(n) \coloneqq x(n) + y(n)$$
$$(-x)(n) \coloneqq -x(n)$$
$$(r x)(n) \coloneqq r x(n)$$
$$(1)(n) \coloneqq 1$$
$$(x \cdot y)(n) \coloneqq x(n) \cdot y(n)$$

and thus the sequence set $\mathbb{N} \to R$ is a commutative $R$-algebra. 

## Polynomials 

Given a commutative ring $R$, a **sequential polynomial** is a [[sequence]] $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ where there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $i \gt N$, $x(i) = 0$. 

## Operators

### Left shift operator

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ of terms in $R$, the **left shift operator** 
$$T:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$$
is defined as 
$$T(x)(i) \coloneqq x(i + 1)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

### Series operator

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ of terms in $R$, the **series operator** 
$$\Sigma:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$$
is inductively defined as 
$$\Sigma(x)(0) \coloneqq x(0)$$
$$\Sigma(x)(i + 1) \coloneqq \Sigma(x)(i) + x(i + 1)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

For any such sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$, $\Sigma(x)$ is called a **[[series]]**. 

### Inverse series operator

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ of terms in $R$, the **inverse series operator** 
$$\Sigma^{-1}:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$$
is inductively defined as 
$$\Sigma^{-1}(x)(0) \coloneqq x(0)$$
$$\Sigma^{-1}(x)(i + 1) \coloneqq \Sigma^{-1}(x)(i) - x(i + 1)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

For any such sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$, $\Sigma^{-1}(\Sigma(x)) = x$ and  $\Sigma(\Sigma^{-1}(x)) = x$. 

### Infinite product operator

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ of terms in $R$, the **infinite product operator** 
$$\Pi:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$$
is inductively defined as 
$$\Pi(x)(0) \coloneqq x(0)$$
$$\Pi(x)(i + 1) \coloneqq \Pi(x)(i) \cdot x(i + 1)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

For any such sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$, $\Pi(x)$ is called an **[[infinite product]]**. 

### Discrete convolution

Given a commutative ring $R$ and sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ and $y:\mathbb{N} \to R$, the **discrete convolution** 
$$(-)*(-):(\mathbb{N} \to R) \times (\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$$
is defined as 
$$(x*y)(i) \coloneqq \sum_{n:[0,i]} x(i) y(i - n)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

Given a commutative ring $R$ and sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ and $y:\mathbb{N} \to R$, the **Cauchy product** of the two series $\Sigma(x) \cdot \Sigma(y)$ is the discrete convolution of $x$ and $y$. 

$$\Sigma(x) \cdot \Sigma(y) \coloneqq x * y$$

### Sequential derivative

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$ of terms in $R$, the **sequential derivative** 
$$D:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$$
is defined as 
$$D(x)(i) \coloneqq (i + 1) x(i + 1)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

The sequential derivative is a [[derivation]], where linearity is satisfied by addition and scalar multiplication of sequences and the [[Leibniz rule]] is satisfied for the Cauchy product of sequences. As a result, every sequence algebra is a [[differential algebra]]. 

### Right shift operators

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$, the set of right shifted sequences of $x$ is the [[fiber]] of the left shift operator at $x$:

$$\{y:\mathbb{N} \to R \vert T(y) = x\}$$

A right shift operator is an element of the above set. 

Every sequence in $R$ has a right shift operator $T^{-1}_s:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$ for every term $r \in R$, 
defined as
$$T^{-1}_r(x)(0) = r$$
$$T^{-1}_r(x)(i + i) \coloneqq x(i)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$. 

### Sequential antiderivatives

Given a commutative ring $R$ and a sequence $x:\mathbb{N} \to R$, the set of sequential antiderivatives of $x$ is the [[fiber]] of the sequential derivative at $x$:

$$\{y:\mathbb{N} \to R \vert D(y) = x\}x$$

A __sequential antiderivative__ is a element of the above set. 

If $R$ is a commutative $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra, then every sequence in $R$ has an antiderivative operator $D^{-1}_r:(\mathbb{N} \to R) \to (\mathbb{N} \to R)$ for every term $r \in R$, 
defined as
$$D^{-1}_r(x)(0) = r$$
$$D^{-1}_r(x)(i + i) \coloneqq \frac{1}{i} x(i)$$
for $i \in \mathbb{N}$.
