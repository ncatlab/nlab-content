+-- {: .num_theorem #ATT}
###### Theorem
Suppose that $U:B\to C$ is a [[functor]] which has a [[left adjoint]] $F:C\to B$ with the property that the diagram
$$ F U F U \;\underoverset{\epsilon F U}{F U \epsilon}{\rightrightarrows}\; F U \xrightarrow{\epsilon} 1_B $$
is a [[coequalizer]].  Suppose that $A$ is a category with coequalizers of reflexive pairs; then a functor $R:A\to B$ has a left adjoint if and only if the composite $U R$ does.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
The direction "only if" is obvious since adjunctions compose.  For "if", let $F'$ be a left adjoint of $U R$, and define $L:B\to A$ to be the pointwise coequalizer of
$$ F' U F U \xrightarrow{F' U \epsilon} F' U $$
and
$$
  F' U F U \xrightarrow{F' U \theta U}
  F' U R F' U \xrightarrow{\epsilon' F' U}
  F' U
$$
where $\theta:F \to R F'$ is the [[mate]] of the equality $U R = U R$ under the adjunctions $F\dashv U$ and $F'\dashv U R$.  One then verifies that this works.

###### Remark
The hypotheses on $U$ are satisfied whenever it is [[monadic functor|monadic]].

###### Remark
In fact, it suffices to assume that each counit $\epsilon : F U b \to b$ is a [[regular epimorphism]], rather than it is the coequalizer of a specific given pair of maps.  See [(Street-Verity), Lemma 2.1](#StreetVerity).

## Applications

The [[adjoint lifting theorem]] is a corollary.
