A **simple group** is a [[group]] with no quotient groups except for the trivial group $\{1\}$ and the group itself. Equivalently, a simple group is a group possessing only two [[normal subgroup|normal subgroups]]: the trivial subgroup and the group itself. 

Simple groups are most commonly encountered in the theory of finite groups. Every finite group $G$ admits a [[composition series]], i.e., a finite filtration of subgroups 

$$1 = G_0 \subseteq G_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq G_n = G$$ 

where each inclusion $G_i \subseteq G_{i+1}$ is a [[normal subgroup]] and the quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ (called a **composition factor**) is simple. The condition of simplicity means that that the composition cannot be further refined by addition of strict inclusions of normal subgroups. Furthermore, the [[Jordan-H&ouml;lder theorem]] ensures that any two composition series have the same length and the same composition factors (up to permutation). 

Thus finite simple groups are in some sense the primitive building blocks of finite groups generally. The massive program of classifying all finite simple groups was announced as completed by Daniel Gorenstein in 1983, although some doubts remained because there were some gaps in proofs. Most if not all the gaps are considered by experts in the area to have been filled, but there remain some notable skeptics, including for example Jean-Pierre Serre and John H. Conway (verification needed here). See [[classification of finite simple groups]].
