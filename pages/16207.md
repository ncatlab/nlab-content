## Idea

In the context of [[differential geometry]] and [[special holonomy]], a _stable form_ ([Hitchin, def. 1.1](#Hitchin)) is an element $\phi$ in some [[exterior power]] $\wedge^p V$ of some [[vector space]] $V$,such that the [[orbit]] of this element under the [[action]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL(V)$ is _[[open subset|open]]_.

The [[stabilizer groups]] of such stable forms correspond to flavors of [[special holonomy]].
