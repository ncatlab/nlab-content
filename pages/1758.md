A [[category]] $D$ is **cocomplete** if it has all small [[colimit|colimits]]: that is, if every diagram 

$$ F: D \to C$$

where $D$ is a [[small category]] has a colimit in $C$.

Many familiar categories of mathematical structures are cocomplete: to name just a few examples, [[Set]], [[Grp]], [[Ab]], [[Vect]] and [[Top]] are complete.

A category $D$ is cocomplete if and only if $D^{op}$ is complete, so the abstract properties of cocompleteness mimic those of completeness.
