## Idea


A [[spacetime]] is called _static_ if it is [[stationary spacetime|stationary]] (admits a [[Killing vector field]] which is [[timelike]]) and in addition irrotational (...).


## Properties

### Ehlers transformation

An _[[Ehlers transformation]]_ is a transformation that [[action|acts]] on the parameters of [[static spacetimes]] solving the [[Einstein field equations]] and generates other solutions of the field equations that are in general [[stationary spacetimes]].
