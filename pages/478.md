## Idea

In natural language, the definite article ('the' in English) is generally used only for nouns which are uniquely characterized by context.  Hence we have "the United States of America" and "the book I was just reading," but only "a car" or "a wild late-night party." (Sometimes "the book I was just reading" is abbreviated to "the book", but it should be clear from context that only one book could be meant.)

In [[mathematics]], and especially in [[category theory]], [[homotopy theory]] and [[higher category theory]], it is common to use "the" more generally for something which is characterized uniquely up to unique [[coherence|coherent]] [[isomorphism]] (that is, a unique isomorphism appropriate given the context).  

Thus, for instance, we speak (assuming that any exists) of "the" [[terminal object]] of a category, "the" [[product]] of two objects, "the" [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] of a functor, and so on.  Outside of pure [[category theory]] we have examples such as "the" Dedekind-complete ordered field (the field of [[real numbers]]).

In [[higher category theory]], we extend this usage to objects that are characterized uniquely up to unique coherent [[equivalence]].  Of course, by "unique equivalence" we mean "unique up to 2-equivalence," and so on.  A more [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] way to say this is that _the space ($\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]]) of all such objects is [[contractible space|contractible]]_.

Perhaps uses of 'the' as in

>The Duck-billed Platypus is a primitive mammal that lives in Australia,

arise from an implicit treatment of members of the species as equivalent in terms of their characteristics, so that the type of the species is contractible.


## Formalization

The notion of a "generalized the" can formalized and treated uniformly in [[homotopy type theory]]. Here one can define an [[natural deduction|introduction rule]] for *the* as follows:

$$
  (A:Type),(t:IsContr(A)) \vdash (the(A,t):A).
$$

Here the [[term]] $t$ is one witness for the [[contractible type|contractibility]] of the [[type]] $A$.
