## Idea

A fundamental statement in [[stable homotopy theory]]/[[higher algebra]]/[[chromatic homotopy theory]].

## Statement

For any [[E-∞ ring]] $E$ the [[homotopy kernel]] of the canonical [[morphism]]

$$
  \pi_\bullet R \longrightarrow MU_\bullet(R)
$$

to the [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|complex cobordism]] [[generalized homology theory]] of $R$ consists of  [[nilpotent elements]].

This is due to [[Ethan Devinatz]], [[Mike Hopkins]], and [[Jeff Smith]]. See [Lurie 10, theorem 3](#Lurie10)

## Special cases

The Nishida nilpotence theorem ([Nishida 73](#Nishida73)) is the special case for the [[sphere spectrum]], saying that all positive-degree elements in the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] are nilpotent.

## Consequences

### Relation with $\infty$-fields

The nilpotence theorem implies that every [[∞-field]] is an [[∞-module]] over the [[Morava K-theory]] [[spectrum]] $K(n)$, for some $n$. See at _[[∞-field]]_.
