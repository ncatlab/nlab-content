## Idea

A _super $L_\infty$-algebra_ is an [[L-∞ algebra]] in the context of [[superalgebra]]: the [[higher category theory|higher category theoretical]]/[[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretical]] analog of a [[super Lie algebra]].


## Definition

###### Definition

A **super $L_\infty$-algebra** is an [[L-∞ algebra]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[super vector space]]s. 

The [[category]] of super $L_\infty$-algebras is

$$
  S L_\infty Alg := (ScdgAlg^+_{sf})^{op} 
$$

the [[opposite category]]  of [[semi-free dga|semi-free]] [[dg-algebra]]s in [[super vector space]]s: [[commutative monoid]]s in the category of [[cochain complex]]es of [[super vector space]]s whose underlying commutative [[graded algebra]] is free on generators in positive degree.

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a super $L_\infty$-algebra we write $CE(\mathfrak{g})$
for the corresponding [[dg-algebra]]: its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]].

## Properties

* Every super $L_\infty$-Lie algebra has a [[Lie integration]] to a [[super ∞-groupoid]] and a [[smooth super ∞-groupoid]]. See there for more.

## Examples

In the context of [[supergravity]]/[[string theory]] the

* [[super Poincare Lie algebra]]

and its super-$L_\infty$-extensions to the 

* [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] ([[m2brane]])

* [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]]

* [[type II supergravity Lie 2-algebra]]

play a central role. Their exceptional [[infinity-Lie algebra cohomology]] governs the consistent [[Green-Schwarz action functionals]] for super-$p$-[[branes]]. (See the discusson of the _[brane scan](Green-Schwarz+action+functional#BraneScan)_) there.

Moreover, the [[BRST complex]] of the [[superstring]] might form a super $L_\infty$-algebra whose brackets give the [[n-point function]] of the string, in analogy to what happens for the bosonic string in Zwiebach's [[string field theory]]. (...)
