$$
  \mathbb{Z} \times B U ,\; U ,\; \cdots
  \,.
$$

More generally, to every [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $C$ is associated a [[K-theory]] _space_ which in good cases, such as when the category is presented by a [[Waldhausen category]] is the degree 0 piece of a corresponding [[algebraic K-theory]] spectrum. The detailed construction is known as the [[Waldhausen S-construction]].

It is possible to say that the K-theory spectrum is the categorical ring completion of the symmetric monoidal category of finite dimensional vector spaces over some fixed base field (maybe taking only vector space isomorphisms as mophisms) just in the same way one says that the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum is the ring completion of $\mathbb{N}$ (as a spectrum)?

Since $\mathbb{N}$ is the decategorification of $Vect_{fin.dim.}$ by taking dimension, one can expect a map of spectra induced by $dim$, and this could be cojecturally be the Chern character at a spectra level (the fact that the leading therm of $Ch$ is $dim$ seems to support this point of view).
