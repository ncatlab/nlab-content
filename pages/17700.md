##Idea 

In [[computer science]], a **side effect** refers simply to the modification of some kind of state, such as changing the value of a variable, writing some data to disk or raising an exception.


## Relation to Monads and Algebras and Multicategories

The presence of side effects in a programming language usually means the language cannot be given a [[denotational semantics]] in the category of [[sets]], or in any [[bicartesian closed category]]. Instead, they can be interpreted in the category of [[algebras]] of a [[monad]], often a monad presented by an [[algebraic theory]]. There is a direct relationship between properties of the monad or theory and the type theoretic syntax that can be interpreted in it. 

| [[monads]]  | [[algebraic theories]] |  flavor of [[multicategory]] | typical model |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[strong monad]] | arbitrary theory | [[call-by-push-value]]/[[Freyd multicategory]]  | [[enriched category]] |
| [[monoidal monad]] | [[commutative algebraic theory]] | [[linear logic]]/[[linear-non-linear logic]] | [[symmetric monoidal category]]
| [[affine monad]]  | [[affine algebraic theory]] | [[affine logic]] | [[semicartesian monoidal category]] |
| [[relevant monad]] | [[relevant algebraic theory]] | [[relevance logic]] | [[relevance monoidal category]] |
| affine and relevant | affine and relevant theory | [[cartesian multicategory]]/[[S4]] | monoidal adjunction between [[bicartesian closed]] categories
