Higher topos theory is the generalisation to [[higher category theory]] of [[topos theory]].

[[Jacob Lurie]] has done much work on $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topos|toposes]] (which he calls simply ‘$\infty$-toposes’).  In particular, see his book, _[[Higher Topos Theory]]_.

[[Mike Shulman]] has some ideas about more general higher topos theory at [[michaelshulman:n-topos for large n]].
