##Idea 

Higher topos theory is the generalisation to [[higher category theory]] of [[topos theory]]. It is partly motivated by [[Grothendieck]]'s program in _[[Pursuing Stacks]]_.

More generally, the concept _$(n,r)$-topos_ is to [[topos]] as [[(n,r)-category]] is to [[category]].

Rather little is known about the very general notion of higher topos theory. A rich theory however exists in the context of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]], as described in [[Jacob Lurie|Jacob Lurie's]] book [[Higher Topos Theory]], which only covers the $(\infty, 1)$ case.

Just as the archetypical example of an ordinary [[topos]] (i.e. a $(1,1)$-topos) is [[Set]] -- the category of [[0-category|0-categories]] -- so the $\infty$-category of [[n-category|n-categories]] or at least of $n$-[[groupoid]]s should form the archetypical example of an $(n+1,1)$-topos. [[Pos]], the category of [[posets]] and monotone maps, should form the archetypal example of a $(1,2)$-topos.
