Higher topos theory is the generalisation to [[higher category theory]] of [[topos theory]]. It is partly motivated by the [[Grothendieck]]'s program in [[Pursuing Stacks]].

Early frameworks for Grothendieck (as opposed to "elementary") $(\infty,1)$-topoi are due [[Charles Rezk]] and Toën-Vezzosi in two versions (preprints 2002), via simplically enriched categories and via Segal categories:

Adv. Math. 193 (2005), no. 2, 257--372, [arXiv:math.AT/0207028](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0207028)

* B. Toën , G. Vezzosi, _Segal topoi and stacks over Segal categories_, [arXiv:math.AG/0212330](http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0212330)

[[Jacob Lurie]] has done much work on $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topos|toposes]] (which he calls simply ‘$\infty$-toposes’).  In particular, see his book, _[[Higher Topos Theory]]_.

[[Mike Shulman]] has some ideas about more general higher topos theory at [[michaelshulman:n-topos for large n]].
