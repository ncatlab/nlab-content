## Idea

**Combinatory logic** is a rephrasing of the [[lambda calculus]] that avoids explicit mention of [[variables]] and of [[lambda abstraction]].  Instead it uses [[combinators]] -- in the most common case, they are traditionally called $S$, $K$, and $I$ -- with the only other operation being [[application]].

Under the [[propositions as types]] correspondence, combinatory logic corresponds to the presentation of [[logic]] using a [[Hilbert system]] (instead of [[natural deduction]] or [[sequent calculus]]).  There are versions of combinatory logic corresponding to [[linear logic]] and [[affine logic]], generally called **BCI logic** and **BCK logic** (after the combinators they use).

## The combinators S, K, and I

The basic combinators can be defined in terms of $\lambda$-calculus is

* $S = \lambda x. \lambda y. \lambda z. (x z)(y z)$
* $K = \lambda x. \lambda y. x$
* $I = \lambda x. x$

In [[simply typed lambda-calculus]], these combinators are [[polymorphic]] with types

* $S : (A \to (B\to C)) \to (A\to B) \to (A\to C)$
* $K : A\to (B\to A)$
* $I : A\to A$

for arbitrary types $A,B,C$.

When combinatory logic is presented on its own rather than in terms of $\lambda$-calculus, the combinators are characterized by reduction rules that mirror their definition in terms of $\lambda$-abstractions:

* $S x y z \equiv (x z)(y z)$
* $K x y \equiv x$
* $I x \equiv x$

Sometimes the combinator $I$ is omitted, as it can be defined from $S$ and $K$ as $I=S K K$.

## Encoding abstraction

The combinators $S$, $K$, and $I$ are used to encode $\lambda$-abstraction in the following way.  If $M$ is a term in combinatory logic (perhaps containing variables), we define $\lambda x.M$ by induction over the structure of the term $M$.

* If $M=x$, then $\lambda x.x = I$.
* If $M$ is a variable $y\neq x$, then $\lambda x.y = K y$.
* If $M = N P$ is an application of one term to another, then $\lambda x.M = S (\lambda x.N) (\lambda x.P)$, so we can recursively translate $\lambda x.N$ and $\lambda x.P$.

(It is common to see this described with the second case given as "$\lambda x.M = K M$ whenever $M$ does not contain $x$ as a [[free variable]]".  However, this overlaps with the third case and is not structurally recursive.  The above definition translates $\lambda x.y z$ to $S(K y)(K z)$, while the one with the free-variable-check produces $K(y z)$; both reduce to $y z$ when applied to any argument.)

Using this construction of an "abstraction operator" in the combinatory logic, we can then proceed to translate an arbitrary term of $\lambda$-calculus into combinatory logic by translating all the abstractions "from the inside out".  Formally, we crawl over the term and whenever we find an abstraction, we first recurse into its body, then we apply the above abstraction operator.

The construction of an abstraction operator in combinatory logic is analogous to a [[cut admissibility]] theorem; the resulting translation of $\lambda$-calculus into combinatory logic is then analogous to the corresponding [[cut-elimination]] theorem.

## Linear (BCI) and affine (BCK) combinatory logic 

Versions of combinatory logic that correspond to [[linear logic]] and [[affine logic]] have been studied under the names **BCI logic** and **BCK logic**  respectively, with the letters indicating the combinators used, where

* $B = \lambda x.\lambda y.\lambda z. x(yz) : (B\to C) \to (A\to B) \to (A\to C)$
* $C = \lambda x.\lambda y.\lambda z. (xz)y : (A\to (B\to C)) \to (B \to (A\to C))$

The combinator $I$ is also definable as $CKK$, so it is also available in BCK logic (which might therefore be called BCKI logic).  Similarly, traditional combinatory logic could be called "SKI logic", or just "SK logic".

Note that $B$ has the same type as the "composition" operation in a [[closed category]], while $C$ has the type of a symmetry/exchange for a closed category.  Similarly, $K$ is a sort of [[weakening rule]] while $S$ combines composition, symmetry, and [[contraction rule|contraction]].
