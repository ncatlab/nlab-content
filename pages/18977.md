##Idea

The **principle of compositionality** asserts that the nature of complex structures is entirely determined by that of their simpler parts and the way these are composed.

This is sometimes called **Frege's principle** after [[Gottlob Frege]], although it was arguably assumed in [Boole 1854](#Boole1854), decades before Frege's work, and possibly not even embraced by Frege (see [Pelletier 01](#Pelletier01)).

The concept became popular in [[linguistics]] with the formalization of [[semantics]] of formal and informal languages via [[Montague semantics]]
([Montague 70a](#Montague70a),
[Montague 70b](#Montague70b),
[Montague 73](#Montague73)), where the principle asserts that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. 



### In computation

From [Compositionality 16](#Comp16): 

> The compositional description of complex objects is a fundamental feature of the logical structure of [[computation]]. The use of logical languages in database theory and in algorithmic and finite model theory provides a basic level of compositionality, but establishing systematic relationships between compositional descriptions and complexity remains elusive. Compositional models of probabilistic systems and languages have been developed, but inferring probabilistic properties of systems in a compositional fashion is an important challenge. In quantum computation, the phenomenon of entanglement poses a challenge at a fundamental level to the scope of compositional descriptions. At the same time, compositionally has been proposed as a fundamental principle for the development of physical theories.
