## Idea

Analytic varieties form an analogue of [[algebraic varieties]] in analytic context; they are more general than [[analytic manifolds]] in allowing [[singularity|singularities]].

While an algebraic variety is the loci of zeros of some set of [[polynomials]], an analytic varieties is the loci of zeros of some set of [[analytic functions]]. By Chow's theorem every [[complex number|complex]] [[projective variety|projective]] analytic variety is algebraic; this is based on the machinery of Weierstrass (the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]] etc.).
