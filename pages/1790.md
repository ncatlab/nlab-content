Among the various [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model structures on simplicial presheaves]] (see there for details, background and motivation), the _Čech_ model structure is in between the [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. The latter is obtained by localizing the global structure at local weak equivalences -- in particular [[hypercovers]] -- , while the Čech structure is obtained by localizing only at [[Čech covers]].

Accordingly, the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by the Čech model structure has as its [[cohomology]] theory [[Čech cohomology]].

See the further remarks at [[hypercover]].

But beware of this document is unfinished. In particular there is some statement somewhere that makes it sound as if Čech covers are equal to hypercovers, while the rest of the text emphasises how they are distinct.
