Among the various [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model structures on simplicial presheaves]] (see there for details, background and motivation), the _Cech_ model structure is in between the [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. The latter is obtained by localizing the global structure at local weak equivalences -- in particular [[hypercover]]s -- , while the Cech structure is obtained by localizing only at [[Cech cover]]s.

Accordingly, the [[(infinity,1)-topos]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by the Cech model structure has as its [[cohomology]] theory [[Cech cohomology]].

See the further remarks at [[hypercover]].

A detailed though unfinished account of the Cech model structure is given in

* Daniel Dugger, _Sheaves and homotopy theory_ ([web](http://www.uoregon.edu/~ddugger/cech.html))

But beware of this document is unfinished. In particular there is some statement somewhere that makes it sound as if Cech covers are equal to hypercovers, while the rest of the text emphasises how they are distinct.
