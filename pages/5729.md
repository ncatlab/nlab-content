Given a category $C$ and an object $B:C$, let $\mathrm{Mono}(B)$ be the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[subobjects]] of $B$ and whose [[morphisms]] are [[monomorphisms]]. A descending chain of subobjects of $B$ is a [[sequence]] of subobjects $A:\mathbb{N} \to \mathrm{Mono}(B)$ with the following [[dependent type|dependent sequence]] of monomorphisms: for natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a dependent monomorphism $i_n:A_{n+1} \hookrightarrow A_{n}$. 

An object $B$ is said to satisfy the **descending chain condition** on its subbimodules if for every descending chain of subobjects $(A, i_n)$ of $B$, there exists a natural number $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all natural numbers $n \geq m$, the monomorphism $i_n:A_{n+1} \hookrightarrow A_{n}$ is an [[isomorphism]]. 

A [[ring]] $R$ is said to satisfy the _descending chain condition_ on left (resp. right, two-sided) [[ideal|ideals]] if any [[total order|totally ordered]] subset $\mathcal{S}$ of the set of left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of $R$ (in the [[partial order]] given by the inclusion) has a minimum.
