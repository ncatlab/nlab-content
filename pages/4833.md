## Idea

Given a [[cartesian monad]] $T$ on a [[cartesian category]] $C$ one can define a generalized graph and a [[generalized multicategory]] of type $T$ ($T$-multicategory). We want to impose a "suitability" condition on $C$ and $T$ which would ensure that one can talk about a free $T$-multicategory. In other words, the forgetful functor 
$$
U : (C,T)Multicat \to (C,T)Graph
$$ 
from $T$-multicategories to $T$-graphs has a left adjoint $F$; this adjunction induces hence a monad $T^+ = (UF, U\epsilon F,\eta)$ on $C^+ := (C,T)Graph$. Moreover one wants to be able to build new cartesian monads iteratively, namely to ensure the same suitability conditions on the $T^+$, $T^{++}$ and so on. This is used for example in some of the possible inductive definitions of [[opetope]]s. 


## Definition

A *category* $C$ is **suitable** (in the sense of [[Tom Leinster]]) if 

* $C$ is cartesian
* $C$ has disjoint finite coproducts, which are also stable under pullback
* $C$ has colimits of all nested sequences; they commute with pullback and have monic injections (coprojections)

A *monad* $T = (T,\mu,\eta)$ is **suitable** if 

* $(T,\mu,\eta)$ is cartesian
* its underlying endofunctor $T$ preserves colimits of nested sequences


## Properties

Any [[presheaf topos]] is suitable. Any [[finitary monad|finitary]] [[cartesian monad]] is suitable. 

The forgetful functor from the category of $T$-multicategories to the category of $T$-graphs has a left adjoint and the adjunction is monadic; the category of $T$-graphs is then suitable and the induced monad is suitable.
