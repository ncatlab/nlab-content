Word current in physics denotes either a gradient of density of a field or matter or gradient of wave function or of order parameter. Most currents (though not all) in that sense satisfy some conservation laws, e.g. the current of electric charge. This lead to the notion of [[conserved charge]], see there. 

In analysis, and specially in geometric measure theory, there is a different notion also called current. It is a [[generalized function]] (distribution in the sense of Schwartz and others) with values in [[differential form]]s.
See at [[current (distribution theory)]] also [[integral current]]. 

Regarding the material connotations it is not very suprising that the physics notion of current is related to distribution of stuff, and that analysis notion to distribution in Schwartz sense. Thus two notions of distribution (and the third, distribution of hyperplanes or subspaces in tangent bundle on a manifold) and two notions of current are related.
