For $S$ a small [[site]] let $SimpSh(S)$ be the full category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on $S$ which satisfy the [[sheaf]] condition.

The local [[model category]] structure on $SimpSh(S)$ is originally due to Joyal. It is closely related to the local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

#Local model structure#

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

There is a proper closed [[enriched category|simplicially enriched]] [[model category]] structure on $SimpSh(S)$ such that

* cofibrations are precisely the monomorphisms in $SimpSh(S)$;

* weak equivalences are the _local weak equivalences_ of the underlying simplicial presheaves as defined at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

See theorem 5 in _Jardine07_.

##Remarks##

* The local model structure on simplicial sheaves provides a model for [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]], as described on [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0604/0604504v3.pdf#page=11) of To&euml;n: _Higher and derived stacks: a global overview_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0604504))
