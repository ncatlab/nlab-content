For $S$ a small [[site]] let $SimpSh(S)$ be the full category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on $S$ which satisfy the [[sheaf]] condition.

The local [[model category]] structure on $SimpSh(S)$ is originally due to Joyal. It is closely related to the local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

###### Theorem 

There is a proper closed [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched]] [[model category]] structure on $SimpSh(S)$ such that

* cofibrations are precisely the objectwise cofibrations (monomorphisms) of [[simplicial set]]s;


* weak equivalences are the _local weak equivalences_ of the underlying simplicial presheaves as defined at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

###### Theorem 

The inclusion of sheaves into simplicial presheaves
$SimpSh(S) \hookrightarrow SimpPr(S)$ and the sheafification functor 
$SimpPr(S) \to SimpSh(S)$ constitute a 
[[Quillen equivalence]] with respect to the above
_first local model structure_ on $SimpPr(S)$ ans the local 
[[model structure on simplicial sheaves]].
