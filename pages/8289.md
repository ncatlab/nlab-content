## Definition

A **bifunctor** (short for __binary functor__, that is $2$-ary) or **functor of two variables** is simply a _[[functor]]_ whose [[domain]] is the [[product]] of two [[categories]].

For for $C_1$, $C_2$ and $D$ [[categories]], a functor

$$
  F : C_1 \times C_2 \to D
$$

is also called a _bifunctor_ from $C_1$ and $C_2$ to $D$.


## Examples

Famous bifunctors are 

* the [[hom functor]]

  $$
    Hom(-,-) : C^{op} \times C \to Set
  $$

  on any [[small category]] $C$, or if $C$ is a [[closed category]], the [[internal hom]] functor

  $$
    [-,-] : C^{op} \times C \to C
    \,.
  $$

* on every [[monoidal category]] $(C, \otimes)$ the [[tensor product]] functor

  $$
    \otimes : C \times C \to C
  $$
