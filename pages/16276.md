## Idea

Given a [[WZW term]] $\mathbf{L}$ (a [[differential cohomology|differential cocycle]]) on some $V$, and given a $V$-[[manifold]] $X$, a _definite globalization_ of $\mathbf{L}$ over $V$ is a WZW term $\mathbf{L}^X$ on $X$ which is suitably locally equivalent to $\mathbf{L}$. In particular the [[curvature]] form of $\mathbf{L}^X$ is a [[definite form]] on $X$, definite on the curvature form of the local model $\mathbf{L}$.

Hence a definite globalization of a WZW term may be thought of as a [[higher prequantization]] of a [[definite form]].

Definite gobalizations of WZW terms $\mathbf{L}$ induce [[parameterized WZW terms|definite parameterizations]], namely parameterization of the restriction $\mathbf{L}^{inf}$ of $\mathbf{L}$ to the [[infinitesimal disk]] in $V$, over the  infinitesimal disk bundle of $X$. These in turn correspond to [[G-structures]] for $G$ the [[homotopy stabilizer group]] of $\mathbf{L}^{inf}$.

## Examples

### Geometric pre-quantization

By the [[Darboux theorem]] for line bundles, every [[prequantization]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] is automatically a definite globalization of some fixed pre-quantization of $(\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \mathbf{d}p_i \wedge \mathbf{d}q^i)$.

### Super $p$-branes on curved super-spacetimes

The [[equations of motion]] of [[supergravity]] theories typically imply that the WZW curvatures of the relevant [[super p-brane sigma models]] on [[super Minkowski spacetime]] extend as [[definite forms]] over the [[super-spacetime]]. Hence the full WZW term defining the [[super p-brane sigma model]] needs to be a definite globalization over super-spacetime of the local model over super-Minkowski spacetime.
