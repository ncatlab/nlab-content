### Idea

[[quantum group|Quantum groups]] were introduced independently by Drinfeld and Jimbo around 1984. One of the most important examples of quantum groups are deformations of 
[[universal enveloping algebras]]. These [[deformations]] are closely related to Lie bialgebras. In particular, every deformation of a universal enveloping algebra induces
a Lie bialgebra structure on the underling Lie algebra. In ([Drinfeld](#Drinfeld)) Drinfeld asked if the converse of this statement holds: 

"Does there exist a universal quantization for Lie bialgebras?"

This was answered to the positive in ([Etingof-Kazhdan](#EtingofKazhdan)).
