## Definition

An [[abelian group object]] [[internalization|in]] the [[category]] $CondSet$ of [[condensed sets]].

## Properties

The category of condensed abelian groups $CondAb$ enjoys excellent categorical properties for [[homological algebra]]:

* It is an [[abelian category]] that admits all [[small limit|small]] [[limits]] and [[colimits]];

* In this category, [[filtered colimits]] and infinite [[products]] are [[exact functor|exact]].
The latter property is rather rare.

* It has enough [[compact projective objects]]: [[free construction|free]] condensed abelian groups on [[extremally disconnected]] [[compact Hausdorff topological spaces]] generate all condensed abelian groups under small [[colimits]] and their [[corepresentable functors]] [[conservative functor|reflect isomorphisms]];

* The previous property implies that condensed abelian groups have the same exactness properties as the category of [[abelian groups]].
