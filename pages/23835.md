## Idea

A large class of solutions of the [[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation]], hence a large class of [[braid group representations]], arises as the [[Dolbeault cohomology|holomorphic]] [[twisted de Rham cohomology]]  (twisted by a "[[local system]]") of [[configuration spaces of points]] in the punctured [[plane]] ([Schechtman & Varchenko 89](#SchechtmanVarchenko89), [90](#SchechtmanVarchenko90), [91](#SchechtmanVarchenko91)). This subsumes in particular the construction of [[conformal blocks]] (on the punctured [[Riemann sphere]]) for [[2d CFTs]] of [[affine Lie algebra]]/[[WZW model]]-type ([Feigin, Schechtman & Varchenko 90](#FeiginSchechtmanVarchenko90), [94](#FeiginSchechtmanVarchenko90), [95](#FeiginSchechtmanVarchenko95)).

Since the canonical [[differential form]]-representatives in this construction may be regarded as generalized [[hypergeometric functions]], the original authors referred to this approach as "hypergeometric solutions" to the [[KZ equation]] ([Schechtman & Varchenko 90](#SchechtmanVarchenko90)). In hindsight, it is not the theory of hypergeometric functions that drives the theory, but the peculiarities of (holomorphic) [[local systems]] and their [[twisted de Rham cohomology]] of [[configuration spaces of points]].
