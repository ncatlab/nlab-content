## Idea

The Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem characterizes [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[smooth functions]] ([[bump functions]]) and [[compactly supported distributions]] in terms of the decay property of their [[Fourier transform]] ([[Fourier transform of distributions|of distributions]]).

Conversely this means that for a general distribution those [[covectors]] along which its [[Fourier transform of distributions|Fourier transform]] does not suitably decay detect the singular nature of the distribution (its failure to be represented by a smooth function) in a refined form which records not only the [[singular support of a distribution|singular support]] (the point at which that covector is based), but also the "direction of [[propagation of singularities theorem|propagation of singularities]]". The collection of these covectors is called the _[[wave front set]]_ of the distribution. The study of [[functional analysis]] with attention to the [[wave front sets]] is called _[[microlocal analysis]]_. This plays a central role in the definition of various operations on distributions, such as the [[pullback of distributions]] and the [[product of distributions]].

###### Theorem
**(Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem)**


For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the vector space $C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[smooth functions]] ([[bump functions]]) on [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is (algebraically and topologically) [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], via the [[Fourier transform]], to the space of [[entire functions]] $F$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ which satisfy the following estimate: there is a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $B$ such that for every [[integer]] $N \gt 0$ there is a real number $C_N$ such that:

$$ 
  \underset{\xi \in \mathbb{C}^n}{\forall} 
  \left(
    {\Vert  F(\xi) \Vert}
    \le C_N (1 + {\vert \xi\vert })^{-N} \exp{ (B \; |Im(\xi)|)}
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 

More generally, the space of [[compactly supported distributions]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[order of a distribution|order]] $N$ is isomorphic via [[Fourier transform of distributions]] to those [[entire functions]] on $\mathbb{C}^n$ for which there exists positive [[real numbers]] $C$ and $B$ such that

$$ 
  \underset{\xi \in \mathbb{C}^n}{\forall} 
  \left(
    {\Vert F(\xi)  \Vert}
      \le 
    C_N (1 + {\vert \xi\vert })^{N} \exp{ (B \; |Im(\xi)|)}
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 

(Notice that the [[Fourier transform of distributions|Fourier transform]] of a [[compactly supported distribution]] is guaranteed to be a [[smooth function]], by [this prop.](Fourier+transform+of+distributions#FourierTransformOfCompactlySupportedDistributions).)
