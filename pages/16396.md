## Idea

In [[motivic homotopy theory]], the slice filtration is a filtration of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ and of $SH(S)$ which is analogous to the [[Postnikov tower in an (∞,1)-category|Postnikov filtration]] for [[(∞,1)-topoi]]. It generalizes the _coniveau filtration_ in [[algebraic K-theory]], the _fundamental filtration_ on [[Witt groups]], and the _weight filtration_ on [[mixed Tate motives]].

If $S$ is [[smooth scheme|smooth]] over a [[field]], the layers of the slice filtration of a motivic spectrum (called its _slices_) are modules over the [motivic Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum](#MotivicCohomology) $H(\mathbb{Z})$. At least if $S$ is a [[field]] of characteristic zero, this is the same thing as an integral [[motive]]. The [[spectral sequences]] associated to the slice filtration are analogous to the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]s in that their first page consists of [[motivic cohomology]] groups.
