## Idea

In [[string theory]] a [[spacetime]] [[landscape of string theory vacua|vaccuum]] is encoded by a [[sigma-model]] 2-dimensional [[SCFT]]. In _heterotic string theory_ that SCFT is assumed to be the sum of a supersymmetric chiral piece and a  non-supersymmetric piece (therefore "heterotic").

## Properties

### Compactifications

An effective [[target space]] [[quantum field theory]] induced from a given heterotic 2d [[CFT]] [[sigma model]] that has a [[spacetime]] of the form $M^4 \times Y^6$ for $M^4$ the 4-dimensional [[Minkowski space]] that is experimentally observed locally (say on the scale of a particle accelerator) has $N= 1$ global [[supersymmetry]] precisely if the remaining 6-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] $Y^6$ is a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]. See the [references below](#ReferencesNEqOne). 

Since global $N=1$ supersymmetry for a long time has been considered a promising phenomenological model in high energy physics, this fact has induced a lot of interest in heterotic string background with a Yalabi-Yau factor.

#### On elliptic fibrations


Compactified on an [[elliptic curve]] or, more generally, [[elliptic fibration]], heterotic string compactifictions are controled by a choice holomorphic [[stable bundle]] on the compact space. Dually this is an [[F-theory]] compactification on a [[K3]]-bundles.
