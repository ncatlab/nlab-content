##Idea

Pro-homotopy theory involves the study of [[model category]] and other abstract homotopy theoretic structure on pro-categories of spaces or simplicial sets. (The term can also be used for any extension of homotopical structures for a category $C$ to the corresponding $Pro(C)$.)

##Uses

* In [[strong shape theory]], 

* In [[etale homotopy theory|étale homotopy theory]] and motivic homotopy.

*  In [[proper homotopy theory]].
