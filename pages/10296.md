## What is this entry about

Following Serre, [[gebra]] is a common term for [[associative algebra]]s and coassociative [[coalgebra]]s (also called cogebras), and sometimes more involved variants and combinations, like [[bialgebra]]s (also, more properly, called bigebras). 

When working over a field, finite dimensional algebras are duals to finite dimensional cogebras. When the dimension is infinite, even for algebraic duals, the situation is more complicated. This entry should sort out these issues.
