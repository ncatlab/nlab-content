
In the context of [[BV-quantization]] for classical BV-operator $Q$, a _gauge fixing operator_ is a $Q^{GF}$ such that $H \coloneqq [Q,G^{GF}]$ is a [[generalized Laplace operator]]. 

See at _[[renormalization]]_ in the section _[Of theories in BV-CS form](renormalization#OfTheoriesInBVForm)_ for more details.
