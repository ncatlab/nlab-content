## Idea

The _Peierls bracket_ ([Peierls 52](#Peierls52)) is equivalently the canonical [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]] [[Poisson bracket]] on the [[covariant phase space]] of [[field theories]] such as of the [[scalar field]] ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](#DutschFredenhagen01), [Khavkine 14](#Khavkine14), [Collini 16, prop. 31 and below](#Collini16)). Its construction requires the linearized [[field (physics)|field]] [[equations of motion]] satisfied by the [[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]] fields to have unique  [[retarded and advanced Green functions]]. Moreover, it extends "off shell" from the [[phase space]] to the space of all field configurations ([Marolf 94](#Marolf94), [Dütsch-Fredenhagen 03, section 2.1](#DuetschFredenhagen03), [Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, section 5](#FredenhagenRejzner12)), where however it is only [[Poisson bracket]], no longer [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]]. For more on this aspect see at _[[off-shell Poisson bracket]]_.

The [[Peierls bracket]] of two suitably [[smooth function|smooth]] [[functions]] $A$ and $B$ on [[field (physics)|field]] configuration space is the antisymmetrized influence on $B$ of an [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] perturbation of a [[gauge fixing|gauge-fixed]] [[action]] by a function that restricts to $A$ on the embedding of the space of solutions in the field configuration space. It is the construction of the influence of $A$ on $B$ that requires the existence of unique retarded and advanced [[Green's functions]] of the linearized field equations. One can avoid [[gauge fixing]] the action, as long as $A$ and $B$ are [[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]] [[observables]]. In that case, unique retarded and advanced Green's functions may not exist, but due to the gauge invariance of $A$ and $B$ any representative of the gauge equivalence class of Green's functions with appropriate causal [[support]]. Since gauge invariant observables can be expressed in terms of gauge invariant fields (at least at the linearized level, which is all that matters in the construction) the existence and uniqueness of such equivalence classes of Green's functions is equivalent to the existence and uniqueness of retarded and advanced Green's functions for the linearized field equations satisfied by gauge invariant field combinations. 

For example, in [[electrodynamics]], advanced and retarded Green's functions exist on [[globally hyperbolic spacetimes]] for [[Maxwell equations]] in terms of the [[field strength]] $F=\mathbf{d}A$ and correspond to unique gauge equivalence classes of Green's functions for Maxwell equations in terms of the [[vector potential]] $A$.

The [[algebra of functions]] on the space of field configurations becomes a [[Poisson algebra]] in the following way. Pick a set of functions on the space of field configurations that restrict to a non-degeneratce [[coordinate system]] on the embedded [[covariant phase space]]. These functions, together with the [[equations of motion]] and [[gauge fixing]] conditions define a [[Poisson bivector]] by being declared canonical, such that the [[kernel]] of the bivector coincides with the ideal generated by the [[equations of motion]] and the [[gauge fixing]] conditions. Obviously the Poisson structure thus constructed on the algebra of functions on field configurations is not unique and depends on the above choice of coordinates; the same non-uniqueness may be parametrized instead by a choice of a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the space of field configurations. The embedded [[covariant phase space]] becomes a [[symplectic leaf]] of the symplectic [[foliation]] of the space of field configurations.

### The off-shell Peierls bracket

The idea of ([Marolf 93](#Marolf93), section II) is this: 

If $\{q(0), p(0)\}$ is the given (symplectic) Poisson bracket
on the space of solutions, identified with the space of 
initial data, then requiring that everything Poisson-commutes
with $EL(S)$, the 
[[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange functional]] of the action, 
uniquely extends this to a bracket $\{q(t_1), p(t_2)\}$
on all hisories, because commutation with $EL(S)$
involves generation of time translation. 
Here $EL(S)$ generates a Poisson ideal and dividing that
out reproduces the original symplectic bracket.

Now observe (Khavkine 1) that $EL(S)$ provides
a foliation of history space by [[symplectic leaves]].
Because under the replacement $EL(S) \mapsto EL(S) - const$
the above still goes through. Observe also (Khavkine 2)
that $EL(S) - const = 0$ is the equations of motion 
for the origial action with a [[source]] term $J q$ added.
Hence the off-shell Peierls Poisson structure has 
[[symplectic leaves]] parameterized by the [[source]] $J$.

Observe finally (Khavkine 3) that with ([Marolf 93, section III B](#Marolf93)) it follows that the Peierls bracket on the shifted leaves
agrees with the original one. (...)

###### Proposition
**(Peierls bracket is the canonical Poisson bracket in field theory)

Given a [[local Lagrangian field theory]], assume that its [[gauge symmetries]] are globally recognizable ([Khavkine 14, section 3.2.2](#Khavkine14)). Then the Peierls bracket (def. \ref{PeirlsFormula}) is the [[Poisson bracket]] corresponding to the [[symplectic form]] on the [[reduced phase space|reduced]] [[covariant phase space]].

In this article the Peierls bracket on the [[covariant phase space]] of a [[gauge theory|non-gauge]] system is defined and the equivalence with the Hamiltonian phase space [[symplectic structure]] is (incompletely) demonstrated. Peierls also discusses how the definition extends to gauge theories and to fermionic theories.
