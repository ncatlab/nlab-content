## Idea

Given an (local) [[action functional]] the _Peierls bracket_ ([Peierls 52](#Peierls52)) is a refinement  to [[covariant phase space]] of the "canonical" [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]] [[Poisson bracket]] of the corresponding [[prequantum field theory]]. Moreover, it extends "off shell" from the [[phase space]] to the space of all field configurations ([Marolf 94](#Marolf94),  [Brunetti-Fredenhagen-Ribeiro 12, section 3.2](#BrunettiFredenhagenRibeiro12)) (where however it is only [[Poisson bracket]], no longer [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]]).

The [[Peierls bracket]] of two functions $A$ and $B$ is the antisymmetrized influence on $B$ of an infinitesimal perturbation of a [[gauge fixing|gauge-fixed]] [[action]] by function that restricts to $A$ on the embedding. The algebra of functions on the space of field configurations becomes a [[Poisson algebra]] in the following way. Pick a set of functions on the space of field configurations that restrict to a non-degenerate coordinate system on the embedded covariant phase space. These functions, together with the equations of motion and gauge fixing conditions define a Poisson bivector by being declared canonical, such that the [[kernel]] of the bivector coincides with the ideal generated by the equations of motion and the [[gauge fixing]] conditions. Obviously the Poisson structure thus constructed on the algebra of functions on field configurations is not unique and depends on the above choice of coordinates; the same non-uniqueness may be parametrized instead by a choice of a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the space of field configurations. The embedded covariant phase space becomes a leaf of the symplectic [[foliation]] of the space of field configurations.
