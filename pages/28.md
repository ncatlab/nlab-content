## Definition

A **groupoid** $G$ is a [[category]] in which all morphisms are [[isomorphism|isomorphisms]].  Often the requirement is made that $G$ is [[small category|small]].

A groupoid is **tame** if its [[groupoid cardinality|cardinality]] is finite.

Groupoids form a $2$-[[2-category|category]] (in fact a $(2,1)$-[[(2,1)-category|category]]) [[Grpd]].


## Notation

If $x,y$ are [[objects]] (also called [[vertices]]) of the groupoid $G$ then the set of [[morphisms]] (also called arrows) from $x$ to $y$ is written $G(x,y)$, or other notations for [[hom-sets]].  The set $G(x,x)$ (which is a [[group]] under composition) is also written $G(x)$ and called the _vertex group_ of $G$ at $x$.  It is also written $Aut_G(x)$ and called the [[automorphism group]] of $x$ in $G$, or written $\pi_1(G,x)$ and called the [[fundamental group]] of $G$ at $x$ (especially if you think of a groupoid as giving a [[homotopy 1-type]]).

As in any category, there is a question of notation for the [[composition]], and in particular of the order in which to write things. It can be more convenient to write the composition of $a:x \to y$ and $b: y \to z$ as $a b:x \to z$, although a more traditional notation would be $b a$.  The two conventions can be distinguished by writing $a; b$ or $b\circ a$ (which is the most traditional notation for categories).  See [[composition]] for further discussion.

A groupoid $G$ is _[[connected groupoid|connected]]_, or _[[transitive groupoid|transitive]]_, if $G(x,y)$ is nonempty for all $x,y \in Ob(G)$; it is called _[[inhabited groupoid|inhabited]]_, or _nonempty_, if it has at least one object. A [[maximal element|maximal]] inhabited connected [[subgroupoid]] of $G$ is called a _component_ of $G$, and $G$ is then the [[disjoint union]] (the [[coproduct]] in $\Grpd$) of its connected components. The set of components of $G$ is written $\Pi_0(G)$ (especially if you think of a groupoid as giving a [[homotopy 1-type]]).


## Examples

1. Any [[group]] $H$ gives rise to a groupoid, sometimes denoted $\mathbf{B}H$ but often conflated with $H$ itself, which has exactly one object $*$ and with $\mathbf{B}H(*,*) = H$.  Any inhabited connected groupoid is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to one arising in this way.

2. A [[disjoint union]] of (the one-object groupoids corresponding to) groups is naturally a groupoid, also called a _bundle of groups_.  The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the claim that any groupoid is equivalent to one of this form.

3. From any [[group action|action]] of a [[group]] $H$ on a [[set]] $X$ we obtain an [[action groupoid]] or "[[weak quotient]]" $X//H$.  If $X=\{*\}$ this gives the groupoid $\mathbf{B}H$, above.

4. A [[setoid]], that is a set $X$ equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] $E$, becomes a groupoid with the multiplication $(x,y);(y,z) = (x,z)$ for all $(x,y), (y,z) \in E$.  (This gives one reason for the forward notation for composition.)  Such a groupoid is equivalent to the [[discrete category]] on the [[quotient set]] $X/E$.

5. In particular, if $E$ is the universal relation $X \times X$, then we get the _[[square groupoid]]_ $X^2$, also called the _[[trivial groupoid]]_ on $X$. Despite the latter name, there is an important special case, namely the groupoid $I= \{0,1\}^2$. This groupoid has non-identity elements $\iota:0 \to 1, \iota^{-1}: 1 \to 0$, and can be regarded as a groupoid model of the unit [[interval]] $[0,1]$ in [[topology]].

6. Any [[topological space]] $X$ has a [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ whose objects are the [[points]] of $X$ and whose arrows are (homotopy classes of) [[paths]], with composition by [[concatenation]] of paths.  Note that $\Pi_0(\Pi_1(X)) = \Pi_0(X)$ is the set of [[path component|path components]] of $X$, and for any $x\in X$, $\pi_1(\Pi_1(X),x) = \pi_1(X,x)$ is the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ with basepoint $x$.  In theory one can obtain the higher [[homotopy groups]] in this way as well, by generalizing from the fundamental groupoid to the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]].

7. More generally, if we choose some [[subset]] $S$ of the points of a space $X$, then we have a [[full subcategory|full subgroupoid]] of $\Pi_1(X)$ containing only those points in $S$, denoted $\Pi_1(X,S)$.  This can result in much more manageable groupoids; for instance $\Pi_1([0,1],\{0,1\})$ is the groupoid $I$ considered above, while $\Pi_1([0,1])$ has [[uncountable set|uncountably]] many objects (but is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $I$).

8. If $\Gamma$ is a [[directed graph]] or [[quiver]], then the _[[free groupoid]]_ $F(\Gamma)$ is well defined. It is the left [[adjoint functor]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from groupoids to directed graphs. This shows an advantage of groupoids: the notion of _free equivalence relation_ or _free action groupoid_ does not make sense. But we can still talk of a presentation of an equivalence relation or action groupoid by [[generators and relations]], by considering presentations of groupoids instead. 

   +-- {: .query}
   [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: It's not clear to me that the notion of "free equivalence relation" doesn't make sense.  Can't I talk about a left adjoint to the forgetful functor from equivalence relations to, say, directed graphs?  Maybe sets-equipped-with-a-binary-relation would be more appropriate, but either one works fine.

   [[Ronnie Brown|Ronnie]]: Are you sure this forgetful functor equivalence relations to directed graphs has a left adjoint? Suppose the directed graph $\Gamma$ has one vertex $x$ and one loop $u:x  \to x$. The free groupoid on $\Gamma$ is the group of integers, which as a groupoid is not an equivalence relation. 

   _Toby_:  But there is still a free [[setoid]] (set equipped with an equivalence relation) on $\Gamma$; it is the [[point]].  As a groupoid, it is not the same as the free groupoid on $\Gamma$, although it *is* the same as the free setoid on the free groupoid on $\Gamma$.  If there\'s an advantage to working with groupoids, perhaps it\'s that the free groupoid functor preserves distinctions that the free setoid functor forgets?  (In this case, a distinction preserved or forgotten is that between $\Gamma$ and the point, which as a graph does not have $u$.)

## Properties

### Characterization as 2-coskeletal Kan complexes

Groupoids $K$ are equivalent to 1-[[hypergroupoids]], which are in particular 2-[[coskeletal]] [[Kan complex]]es $N(K)$ -- their [[nerve]]s. 

The objects of the groupoids are the 0-[[simplices]] and the morphisms of the groupoid are the 1-simplices of the Kan complex. The [[composition]] operation $(f,g) \mapsto g \circ f $ in the grouopoid is encoded in the 2-simplices of the Kan complex

$$
  \array{ 
    && y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &=& \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    x &&\underset{g\circ f}{\to}&& z
  }
  \,.
$$


The [[associativity]] condition on the composition is exhibited by the 3-[[coskeleton]]-property of the Kan complex. This says that every simplicial 2-sphere in the Kan complex has  unique filler. With the above identification of 2-simplices with composition operations, this means that the 2 ways

$$
  \array{
    y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& &\to& z
    \\
    \uparrow && &\nearrow&  \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\uparrow &^{\mathllap{g \circ f}}\nearrow& && \downarrow
    \\
    x &\underset{h \circ (g\circ f )}{\to}&&\to& w
  }
  \;\;\;
  and
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& &\to& z
    \\
    \uparrow &\searrow& &&  \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\uparrow && &\searrow^{\mathrlap{h\circ g}}& \downarrow
    \\
    x &\underset{(h \circ g)\circ f}{\to}&&\to& w
  }
$$

of composing a sequence of three composable morphisms are equal

$$
  \array{
    y &\to& &\to& z
    \\
    \downarrow && &\nearrow&  \downarrow
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& && \downarrow
    \\
    x &\to&&\to& w
  }
  \;\;\;
  \stackrel{=}{\to}
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    y &\to& &\to& z
    \\
    \downarrow &\searrow& &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \downarrow && &\searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    x &\to&&\to& w
  }
  \,.
$$


For handling just groupoids exclusively their description in terms of Kan complexes may be a bit of an overkill, but the advantage is that it embeds groupoids naturally in the more general context of [[2-groupoid]]s, [[3-groupoid]]s and eventually [[∞-groupoid]]s. For instance a [[pseudo-functor]] out of an ordinary groupoid into a 2-groupoid is simply a homomorphism of the corresponding Kan complexes.
