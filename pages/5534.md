## Idea

A _continuum_ is in general something opposite to a [[discrete object|discrete]]. 
There are several notions of continuum in mathematics:

* often _the continuum_ is taken to be the [[real line]]; consequently the *cardinality of the continuum* is the cardinality of the [[set]] of [[real numbers]]. There is a related **[[continuum hypothesis]]** in [[set theory]].

* a **metric continuum** is any [[compact space|compact]] [[connected space|connected]] [[metric space]]

In [[physics]], by a continuum one usually means a medium which spreads the physical quantities spatially with some finite density, unlike the physics of a system of [[particles]], where an infinite (delta/function like) density is attached to a discrete system of points. 

## In cohesive homotopy type theory
 {#InCohesiveHomotopyTypeTheory}

One can try to [[axiom|axiomatize]] the notion of continuum in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]]. There the idea of an [[object]] $\mathbb{A}^1$ all whose [[generalized element|points]] are, while different, connectable by _[[continuous function|continuous]]_ [[path groupoid|paths]] is encoded by asking that after applying the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid in a locally infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos|fundamental ∞-groupoid functor]] $\mathbf{\Pi}$ to it, the result is something [[(-1)-connected|contractible]]

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbb{A}^1) \simeq *
  \,.
$$

For instance in the [[model]] of [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|homotopy cohesion]] called [[Smooth∞Grpd]] we have a [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] embedding of [[smooth manifolds]]. Therefore we can embed the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$, the [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ as well as the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$, all equipped with their canonical [[smooth manifold]] structure. This is [[discrete object|discrete]] for the first two, but not for the last one, and homotopy cohesion can detect this:

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,;
$$

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbb{Q}) \simeq \mathbb{Q}
  \,;
$$

but

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq *
  \,.
$$

This reflects the fact that the points of $\mathbb{R}$ form a continuum, but those of $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ do not.

Also the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ with their canonical manifold structure of course form a continuum

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\mathbb{C}) \simeq *
  \,.
$$
