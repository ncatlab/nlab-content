## Idea

In [[quantum theory]] the [[state]] of a [[physical system]] is given by a [[vector]] in a [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector space]] (usually a [[Hilbert space]]). This means that given any two states $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, also their sum as vectors $\psi_1 + \psi_2$ is represents a state. This is called the _superposition_ of the two states.
