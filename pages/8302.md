## Idea

_Ordinary homology_ is [[generalized homology]] with respect to an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $H A$, and often understood over $H \mathbb{Z}$. 

Equivalently this is computed by _[[singular homology]]_ with [[coefficients]] in $A$.


## Properties

### Relation to homotopy groups

Ordinary homology with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}$ of a [[topological space]] $X$  serves to approximate the [[homotopy groups]] of $X$.
