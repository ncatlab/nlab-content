## Idea 

Uniform spaces were invented by Andr&eacute; Weil, to capture a general notion of space for which it makes sense to speak of uniformly continuous functions. Such spaces include (pseudo)[[metric space]]s and [[topological group]]s. 

A uniform structure or uniformity on a set $X$ consists of a collection of global binary relations $\varepsilon$ which allow us to say when one point $x$ is "$\varepsilon$-close" to another $y$. For a metric space, we have for instance relations expressed by the formula $d(x, y) \lt \epsilon$. For a topological group, we have relations $x y^{-1} \in \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is a neighborhood of the identity. 

## Definitions 

A **uniform structure** on a set $X$ consists of a collection of binary relations $U \subseteq X \times X$ (called _entourages_) satisfying the following conditions: 

* The diagonal $\Delta = \{(x, x): x \in X\}$ is contained in every entourage. 
* If $U$ is an entourage, then so is $U^{op} = \{(x, y): (y, x) \in U\}$. 
* For every entourage $U$, there exists an entourage $V$ such that $V \circ V \subseteq U$. Here $W \circ V$ denotes the ordinary relational composite: 
$$W \circ V = \{(x, z): \exists_y (y, z) \in W \wedge (x, y) \in V\}$$
* If $U, V$ are entourages, so is $U \cap V$. 
* If $U$ is an entourage and $U \subseteq V \subseteq X \times X$, then $V$ is an entourage. 

A set equipped with a uniform structure is called a **uniform space**. 

The really critical axioms are the first three: given a collection of binary relations which satisfies those three axioms, we generate a uniform structure straightforwardly by closing up under finite intersections and then taking upward closure. (A collection of binary relations which generates a uniformity in this way is called a _subbase_ of the uniformity. Its finite intersection closure is called a _base_ of the uniformity.) We draw particular attention to the third axiom, which may be called an "$\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$"-principle. It generalizes a principle familiar from analysis in metric spaces, where one establishes $d(x, z) \lt \varepsilon$ by showing there exists $y$ such that $d(x, y) \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $d(y, z) \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and applying the triangle inequality. The utility of this principle for metric spaces, extrapolated in this way, gives uniform spaces much of their power. 

The **uniform topology** induced by a uniformity is defined by taking the neighborhoods of a point $x$ to be sets of the form 

$$U[x] := \{y: (x, y) \in U\}$$ 

where $U$ is an entourage. (Recall that a set is open if it is a neighborhood of every point it contains.) We point out that different uniformities may give rise to the same topology (just as essentially different metrics may give rise to the same topology).  

Given uniform spaces $X$, $Y$, a function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be **uniformly continuous** if for every entourage $V$ of $Y$, $(f \times f)^{-1}(V)$ is an entourage of $X$. Clearly, uniformly continuous functions are continuous with respect to the corresponding uniform topologies, but the converse is false (although see below the discussion in the case where $X$ is compact). There is an obvious category of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous functions. 

One feature of uniform space theory which is not available for general topological spaces is the possibility of taking (Cauchy) completions. The relevant definitions are straightforward: 

* A **Cauchy net** in a uniform space $X$ consists of a directed set $D$ and a function $f: D \to X$ such that for every entourage $U$, there exists $N \in D$ such that $(f(m), f(n)) \in U$ whenever $m, n \geq N$. 

* A Cauchy net $f: D \to X$ **converges** to $x \in X$ if for every entourage $U$, there exists $N \in D$ such that $n \geq N \Rightarrow (x, f(n)) \in U$. 

* A uniform space $X$ is **complete** if every Cauchy net in $X$ converges (not necessarily to a unique point). 

Every uniform space $X$ admits a completion $\overline{X}$, i.e., there is a uniformly continuous embedding $X \to \overline{X}$, $characterized by the following universal property: 

* Given a uniformly continuous function $f: X \to Y$ to a complete uniform space $Y$ extends uniquely to a uniformly continuous $\overline{f}: \overline{X} \to Y$. 

In short, the category of complete uniform spaces is a reflective subcategory of the category of uniform spaces. The embedding $X \to \overline{X}$ is dense. 

## Basic Results

A first wave of results concerns separation axioms: 

* Considered as topological spaces, uniform spaces are regular and (more profoundly) completely regular. 

As a matter of fact, a significant theorem is that a topology is the uniform topology for some uniformity if and only if it is the topology of a completely regular space. See also the discussion below on the relation with metric and pseudometric spaces. 

* For a uniform space, the following separation conditions are equivalent: $T_0$ (the topology distinguishes points), $T_1$ (points are closed), $T_2$ (Hausdorff), $T_3$ (regular Hausdorff), $T_{3\frac1{2}}$ (completely regular Hausdorff). 

* The category of uniform spaces admits arbitrary small products. Hence it is not generally true that uniform spaces are $T_4$ (normal), because for instance an uncountable power of the real line with its usual topology is not a normal space. 

A second wave of results relates uniform spaces to pseudometric spaces (like metric spaces, but dropping the separation axiom that $d(x, y) = 0$ implies $x = y$): 

* Every uniform space embeds uniformly in a product of pseudometric spaces (or in a product of metric spaces if the uniform space is separated or Hausdorff). A uniform space whose uniformity admits a countable subbase is uniformly isomorphic to a pseudometric space (or to a metric space in the Hausdorff case). 

By this result, the results mentioned above on completions of uniform spaces may be proved by appeal to similar results for (pseudo)metric spaces. 

Finally, we mention the special case of compact spaces: 

* A compact space $X$ admits a unique uniformity whose corresponding topology is the topology of $X$. The entourages of this uniformity are precisely the neighborhoods of the diagonal in $X \times X$. 

It follows then that if $X, Y$ are uniform spaces with $X$ compact and if $f: X \to Y$ is continuous, then $f$ is uniformly continuous.
