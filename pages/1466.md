## Idea 

Uniform spaces were invented by Andr&eacute; Weil, to capture a general notion of space for which it makes sense to speak of uniformly continuous functions. Such spaces include (pseudo)[[metric space]]s and [[topological group]]s. 

A uniform structure or uniformity on a set $X$ consists of a collection of global binary relations $\varepsilon$ which allow us to say when one point $x$ is "$\varepsilon$-close" to another $y$. For a metric space, we have for instance relations expressed by the formula $d(x, y) \lt \epsilon$. For a topological group, we have relations $x y^{-1} \in \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is a neighborhood of the identity. 

## Definitions 

A **uniform structure** on a set $X$ consists of a collection of binary [[relation]]s $U \subseteq X \times X$ (called _entourages_) satisfying the following conditions: 
* The diagonal $\Delta = \{(x, x): x \in X\}$ is contained in every entourage. 
* If $U$ is an entourage, then so is $U^{op} = \{(x, y): (y, x) \in U\}$. 
* For every entourage $U$, there exists an entourage $V$ such that $V \circ V \subseteq U$. Here $W \circ V$ denotes the ordinary [[relation|relational composite]]: 
  $$W \circ V = \{(x, z): \exists_y (y, z) \in W \wedge (x, y) \in V\}.$$
* $X \times X$ is an entourage.
* If $U, V$ are entourages, so is $U \cap V$. 
* If $U$ is an entourage and $U \subseteq V \subseteq X \times X$, then $V$ is an entourage. 

A set equipped with a uniform structure is called a **uniform space**. 

The **uniform topology** induced by a uniformity is defined by taking the neighborhoods of a point $x$ to be sets of the form 
$$U[x] := \{y: (x, y) \in U\}$$ 
where $U$ is an entourage. (Recall that a set is open if it is a neighborhood of every point it contains.) We point out that different uniformities may give rise to the same topology (just as different metrics, even uniformly inequivalent ones, may give rise to the same topology).

Given uniform spaces $X$ and $Y$, a function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be **uniformly continuous** if for every entourage $V$ of $Y$, $(f \times f)^{-1}(V)$ is an entourage of $X$. Clearly, uniformly continuous functions are continuous with respect to the corresponding uniform topologies, but the converse is false (although see below the discussion in the case where $X$ is compact). There is an obvious [[concrete category]] $Unif$ of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous functions.

One feature of uniform space theory which is not available for general topological spaces is the possibility of taking (Cauchy) completions. The relevant definitions are straightforward: 

* A **Cauchy net** in a uniform space $X$ consists of a [[direction|directed set]] $D$ and a function $f: D \to X$ such that for every entourage $U$, there exists $N \in D$ such that $(f(m), f(n)) \in U$ whenever $m, n \geq N$. (One can similarly define a **Cauchy filter**.  This definition makes a uniform space into a [[Cauchy space]].)

* A Cauchy net $f: D \to X$ **converges** to $x \in X$ if for every entourage $U$, there exists $N \in D$ such that $n \geq N \Rightarrow (x, f(n)) \in U$.  (This definition makes sense for arbitrary [[net]]s or [[filter]]s, but it can be proved that any convergent net is Cauchy.  This definition makes a uniform space into a [[convergence space]].)

* A uniform space $X$ is **complete** if every Cauchy net/filter in $X$ converges (not necessarily to a unique point).

* A uniform space $X$ is **Hausdorff** or **separated** if every convergent net/filter converges to a unique point.  (This is a purely topological concept.)

Every uniform space $X$ admits a Hausdorff completion $\overline{X}$, i.e., there is a uniformly continuous map $X \to \overline{X}$ (an embedding if $X$ is Hausdorff, dense in any case), characterized by the following universal property: 

* Every uniformly continuous function $f: X \to Y$ to a complete Hausdorff uniform space $Y$ extends uniquely to a uniformly continuous $\overline{f}: \overline{X} \to Y$. 

In short, the category of complete Hausdorff uniform spaces is a [[reflective subcategory]] of $Unif$.

## Basic Results

A first wave of results concerns separation axioms: 

* Considered as topological spaces, uniform spaces are regular and (more profoundly) completely regular. 

As a matter of fact, a significant theorem is that a topology is the uniform topology for some uniformity if and only if it is the topology of a completely regular space. See also the discussion below on the relation with metric and pseudometric spaces. 

* For a uniform space, the following separation conditions are equivalent: $T_0$ (the topology distinguishes points), $T_1$ (points are closed), $T_2$ (Hausdorff), $T_3$ (regular Hausdorff), $T_{3\frac1{2}}$ (completely regular Hausdorff). Of course, this follows from the fact that it is completely regular.

* The category $Unif$ of uniform spaces admits arbitrary small [[product]]s. Hence it is not generally true that uniform spaces are $T_4$ (normal), because for instance an uncountable power of the real line with its usual topology is not a normal space. 

A second wave of results relates uniform spaces to pseudometric spaces (like metric spaces, but dropping the separation axiom that $d(x, y) = 0$ implies $x = y$): 

* Every uniform space embeds uniformly in a product of pseudometric spaces. A uniform space whose uniformity admits a countable subbase is uniformly isomorphic to a pseudometric space (and hence to a metric space if the uniform space is Hausdorff, in which case the uniform space is called __metrisable__). 

By this result, the results mentioned above on completions of uniform spaces may be proved by appeal to similar results for (pseudo)metric spaces. 

Finally, we mention the special case of compact spaces: 

* A [[compact space]] $X$ admits a unique uniformity whose corresponding topology is the topology of $X$. The entourages of this uniformity are precisely the neighborhoods of the diagonal in $X \times X$. 

It follows then that if $X, Y$ are uniform spaces with $X$ compact and if $f: X \to Y$ is continuous, then $f$ is uniformly continuous. 

## Variations

Some authors insist that a uniform space must be Hausdorff; this can be arranged directly in the definition (that is without reference to the uniform topology or to the concept of convergent net/filter) by adding the following axiom, a sort of converse of the first axiom:

* If $(x,y) \in U$ for every entourage $U$, then $x = y$.

If the symmetry axiom (the second axiom) is dropped, then the result is a __quasiuniform space__.  Quasiuniform spaces are related to quasi(pseudo)metrics in the same way as uniform spaces are related to (psuedo)metrics.  Perhaps surprisingly, *every* topological space is quasiuniformisable.

A __gauge space__ consists of a set $X$ and a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of pseudometrics on $X$; one usually requires $\mathcal{D}$ to be a [[filter]].  A gauge space defines a uniform space by taking one entourage for each pseudometric in $\mathcal{D}$ and each positive number $\epsilon$, and every uniform space arises in this way.  However, gauge spaces form a category with a stricter notion of morphism, in which the categories $Met$ (of metric spaces and contractions) and $Unif$ (of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous functions) are both [[full subcategory|full subcategories]].  A __quasigauge space__ consists of a set and a collection of quasipseudometrics; every quasiuniform space arises from a quasigauge space.

In weak [[foundations]] of mathematics, the theorems above may not be provable.  In particular, the theorem that every uniform space arises from a gauge space is equivalent (internal to an arbitrary [[topos]] with a [[natural numbers object]]) to [[dependent choice]] plus [[excluded middle]].  If the concept is to be applied to analysis, then it may be best to define a uniform space as a gauge space satisfying a saturation condition.  (Then not every topological group will count as a uniform space, although the classical examples of Lie groups and topological vector spaces will.)

## Motivation for the axioms

The really critical axioms are the first three: given a collection of binary relations which satisfies those three axioms, we generate a uniform structure straightforwardly by closing up under finite intersections and then taking upward closure. (A collection of binary relations which generates a uniformity in this way is called a _subbase_ of the uniformity. A collection of binary relations which generates a uniformity only upon taking upward closure is called a _base_ of the uniformity; in particular, the finite-intersection closure of a subbase is a base.) Indeed, the final three axioms simply state that the entourages form a [[filter]], so the closure operation is simply the usual generation of a filter from a base or subbase.

We draw particular attention to the third axiom, which may be called an "$\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$"-principle. It generalizes a principle familiar from analysis in metric spaces, where one establishes $d(x, z) \lt \varepsilon$ by showing there exists $y$ such that $d(x, y) \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $d(y, z) \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and applying the triangle inequality. The utility of this principle for metric spaces, extrapolated in this way, gives uniform spaces much of their power. 

The first axiom is a nullary version of the third axiom; together they prove that, given any entourage $U$ and any integer $n \geq 0$, there exists a sequence $V_1, \ldots, V_n$ of entourages such that the composite of this sequence is contained in $U$.  The symmetry axiom then allows one to take the duals of any of the $V_i$ as well.

Altogether, these may be seen as axiomatising the notion of *approximate* [[equivalence relation|equivalence]].  If $\approx$ is an approximate equivalence relation, then we might expect it to be
*  [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]: $x \approx x$ and
*  [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]: $x \approx y$ iff $y \approx $, but
*  NOT [[transitive relation|transitive]]: $x \approx y \approx z$ does not necessarily mean that $x \approx z$.

One could stop there, but this is not a very useful notion of approximation.  Instead we generalise to a *family* of approximate equivalence relations and impose the $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ principle to allow them to be used.  This is nearly the definition of uniform space; in particular, the first axiom states precisely that each entourage is relfexive.  The symmetry axiom in the standard definition is weaker than requiring each individual entourage to be symmetric, but that is not an essential change; every uniformity has a base consisting of only symmetric entourages.  The final three axioms have already been explained as a closure condition; they force equivalent uniformities on a given set (in the sense that the [[identity function]] on the set is uniformaly continuous either way) to be equal.
