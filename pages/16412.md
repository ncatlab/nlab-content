## Idea
 [[Georg Cantor]] used to define the [[continuum]] as a **perfect space** that is [[connected space|connected]] as well. Hence, the property of 'being perfect', as the name indicates as well, can be viewed as forming part of the concept of a 'prototypical' topological space.

## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **perfect** if it has no isolated points, i.e., if every point $x$ belongs to the topological [[closure operator|closure]] of its [[complement]] $X \setminus \{x\}$. 

In a topological space $X$, a [[subset]] is said to be _perfect_ if it is [[closed set|closed]] in $X$ and perfect in its [[subspace topology]]. 

## Example

* The [[Cantor space]] $2^\mathbb{N}$ is perfect, in fact, it is the only [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]], [[compact]], metric space that is perfect.

## Properties

* Every topological space $X$ is the disjoint union of a [[scattered space| scattered subset]] and a perfect subset.
