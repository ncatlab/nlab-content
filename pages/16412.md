A [[topological space]] $X$ is **perfect** if it has no isolated points, i.e., if every point $x$ belongs to the topological [[closure operator|closure]] of its [[complement]] $X \setminus \{x\}$. 

In a topological space $X$, a [[subset]] is said to be _perfect_ if it is [[closed set|closed]] in $X$ and perfect in its [[subspace topology]].
