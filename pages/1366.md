#Idea#

The collection of all [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] should itself be an [[(infinity,n)-category|(infinity,2)-category]], but for many purposes it is quite sufficient to regard only invertible transformations between $(\infty,1)$-functors, which means that one needs just the maximal $(\infty,1)$-category inside that $(\infty,2)$-category of all $(\infty,1)$-categories.

And this $(\infty,1)$-category of all $(\infty,1)$-categories has a very simple definition. This is one of the reasons for [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]]


#Definition#

The [[(infinity,1)-category]] 

$$
  (\infty,1)Cat_1
$$


of all [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] is, modeled as a [[simplicially enriched category]], the [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category]] with

* objects are the small [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]];

* for objects $C$, $D$ the [[Kan complex]] $(\infty,1)Cat_1(C,D)$ is the largest [[Kan complex]] contained in the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-functors]] $Fun(C,D)$.

#Applications#

* of particular interest is the $(\infty,1)$-subcategory $(\infty,1)PresCat_1 \hookrightarrow (\infty,1)Cat_1$ of [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinity,1)-categories]].
