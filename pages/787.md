A **Courant algebroid** is a Lie-algebriac structure encoding a [[n-symplectic manifold|2-symplectic manifold]].

Various different incarnations of this data are considered in the literature. Following Roytenberg's analysis (see below) we may identify a Courant algebroid as a [[Lie infinity-algebroid|Lie 2-algebroid]] that generalizes the notion of [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] to one degree higher:

on its defining [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\Theta)$ exists a graded Poisson bracket $\{-,-\}$ of degree $-2$ and in it a degree 3 element $\Theta$ -- the higher analog of the [[Poisson Lie algebroid|Poisson bivector]] $\pi$ -- such that the differential on $CE(\theta)$ is

$$
  d_{CE(\theta)} = \{\Theta, - \}
  \,.
$$

In the literature, this Lie 2-algebroid perspective on Courant algebroids is not usually considered. Instead, by the [[red herring principle]] what is usually called a Courant algebroid is neither an [[algebroid]] nor in fact in general a [[Lie algebroid]], but is tought of as a generalization of a [[Lie bialgebroid]]: every [[Lie bialgebroid]] induces a Courant algebroid.

The concept of Courant algebroids was originally introduced by Irene Dorfman and Ted Courant to study [[geometric quantization]] in the presence of constraints. Later it was studied by Liu, [[Alan Weinstein]] and Xu in the study of [[double Lie algebroid]]s.

In these parts of the literature Courant algebroids are considered in the form of [[Lie algebroid]]s with relaxed axioms on the bracket. Even of this type there are two different definitions:

* in one there is a skew-symmetric bracket which fails to satisfy a Jacobi identity by a coherent term -- this is the Courant bracket definition proper;

* in the other there is a bracket which satisfies a Jacobi identity but is skew-symmetric only up to a correction term -- this is the Dorfman version.

So there are several different ways to present the structure encoded in a Courant algebroid. The picture that seems to be emerging is that the _true_ meaning of the notoin of Courant algebroids is given by the notion of [[n-symplectic manifold|2-symplectic manifold]]s.

Moreover, the way [[Lie algebroid]]s may be expressed in terms of [[Lie-Rinehart algebra]]s, Courant algebroids yield [[Courant-Dorfman algebra]]s.

A useful place to start reading about Courant algebroids its

* [[Dmitry Roytenberg]], _On the structure of graded symplectic supermanifolds and Courant algebroids_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203110))

This proceeds from the perspective of [[n-symplectic manifold]]s and derives the fact that 2 2-symplectic manifold encodes and is encoded by a Courant algebroid.

Another useful summary of the theory of Courant algebroids is in [section 3](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0401/0401221v1.pdf#page=19) of

* [[Marco Gualtieri]], _Generalized complex geometry_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0401221))


The identification of the [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] incarnation of the same date was given by

* [[Dmitry Roytenberg]] and [[Alan Weinstein]], _Courant algebroids and strongly homotopy Lie algebras_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9802118))

Equation (9) and theorem 4.3 there gives the [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] corresponding to a Courant algebroid (the way the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] gives the [[Lie algebra]] of vector fields). In this perspective the Courant algebroid with base space a point is the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].
