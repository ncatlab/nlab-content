A **Courant algebroid** is a Lie-algebriac structure encoding a [[n-symplectic manifold|2-symplectic manifold]].

By the [[red herring principle]] what is usually called a Courant algebroid is neither an [[algebroid]] nor in fact in general a [[Lie algebroid]], but is a generalization of a [[Lie bialgebroid]]: every [[Lie bialgebroid]] induces a Courant algebroid.

But, every Courant algebroid induces a [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] which is the [[string Lie 2-algebra]] if the base space is a point.

The concept of Courant algebroids was originally introduced by Irene Dorfman and Ted Courant to study [[geometric quantization]] in the presence of constraints. Later it was studied by Liu, [[Alan Weinstein]] and Xu in the study of [[double Lie algebroid]]s.

In these parts of the literature Courant algebroids are considered in the form of [[Lie algebroid]]s with relaxed axioms on the bracket. Even of this type there are two different definitions:

* in one there is a skew-symmetric bracket which fails to satisfy a Jacobi identity by a coherent term -- this is the Courant bracket definition proper;

* in the other there is a bracket which satisfies a Jacobi identity but is skew-symmetric only up to a correction term -- this is the Dorfman version.

Another re-interpretation of Courant's original definition as an $L_\infty$-structure was recognized in _RoytenbergWeinstein98_ (see references below). Equation (9) and theorem 4.3 there gives the [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] corresponding to a Courant Lie algebroid (the way the tangent Lie algebroid gives the Lie algebra of vector fields). In this perspective the Courant Lie algebroid with base space a point is the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

This was further developed in the thesis _Roytenberg99_.

So there are several different ways to present the structure encoded in a Courant algebroid. The picture that seems to be emerging is that the _true_ meaning of the notoin of Courant algebroids is given by the notion of [[n-symplectic manifold|2-symplectic manifold]]s.
