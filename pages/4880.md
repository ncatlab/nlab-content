A **strict 2-equivalence** between [[strict 2-categories]] is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of [[Cat]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] categories.  Thus, it consists of a pair of [[strict 2-functors]] and [[strict 2-natural transformation|strict 2-natural isomorphisms]] relating their composites to identities.

Traditionally this is called simply a *2-equivalence*, with the word *biequivalence* used for [[equivalence of 2-categories|the weaker notion]].  On the nLab we tend to say simply *equivalence* for the weaker notion, in line with our general philosophy that weak higher categories deserve the unadorned names.
