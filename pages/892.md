## Definition

Given a [[set]] $S$, the __power set__ of $S$ is the set $\mathcal{P}S$ of all [[subsets]] of $S$.  Equivalently, it is the set $\TV^S$ of all [[functions]] from $S$ to the set $\TV$ of [[truth values]].  This is often written $2^S$, since there are (at least in [[classical logic]]) exactly $2$ truth values.


## Foundational status

One generally needs a specific axiom in the [[foundations of mathematics]] to ensure the existence of power sets.  In [[material set theory]], this can be phrased as follows:

+-- {: .un_axiom}
###### Axiom (power sets)

If $S$ is a set, then there exists a set $\mathcal{P}$ such that $A \in \mathcal{P}$ if $A \subseteq S$.
=--

One can then use the [[axiom of separation]] (Bounded Separation is enough) to prove that $\mathcal{P}$ may be chosen so that the subsets of $A$ are the *only* members of $\mathcal{P}$; the [[axiom of extensionality]] proves that this $\mathcal{P}$ is unique.

In [[structural set theory]], we state rather that there exists a set $\mathcal{P}$ which indexes the subsets of $A$ and prove uniqueness [[generalised the|up to unique isomorphism]].

In [[predicative mathematics]], the existence of power sets (along with other "impredicative" axioms) is not accepted.  However we can still speak of a power set as a [[proper class]], sometimes called a __power class__.

One can use power sets to construct [[function sets]]; the converse also works using [[excluded middle]] (or anything else that will guarantee the existence of the set of truth values).  In particular, power sets exist in any theory containing excluded middle and function sets; thus predicative theories which include function sets must also be [[constructive mathematics|constructive]].


## Properties

The power set $\mathcal{P}S$ is a [[partial order|poset]] ordered by containment: $A$ precedes $B$ means that $A$ is a [[subset]] of $B$ ($A \subseteq B$).

[[Cantor's theorem]] states that there exists no [[surjection]] from $S$ to $\mathcal{P}S$; as there does exist such an [[injection]], one concludes that
$$ {|S|} \lt {|\mathcal{P}S|} $$
in the usual arithmetic of [[cardinal numbers]].

Power sets live in the category [[Set]].  Given an object $S$ of any [[category]], one can similarly form a poset of [[subobjects]] of $S$; the category is called [[well-powered category|well-powered]] when this poset is [[small category|small]].  One also has an internal notion of power set (a [[power object]]) in a [[topos]].
