## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$, the **category of open subsets** $Op(X)$ of $X$ is the [[category]] whose

* [[object]]s are the [[open subset]]s $U \hookrightarrow X$ of $X$;

* [[morphism]]s are the inclusions 
$
  \array{
     V &&\hookrightarrow && U
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
$ of open subsets into each other.


## Properties

* The category $Op(X)$ is a [[poset]], in fact a [[frame]] (dually a [[locale]]): it is the [[frame of opens]] of $X$.

* The category $Op(X)$ is naturally equipped with the
structure of a [[site]], where a collection $\{U_i \to U\}_i$ of morphisms is a cover precisely if their [[union]] in $X$ equals $U$:
$$ \bigcup_i U_i = U .$$

  The [[category of sheaves]] on $Op(X)$ equipped with this site structure is usually written

  $$
    Sh(X) := Sh(Op(X))
    \,.
  $$
