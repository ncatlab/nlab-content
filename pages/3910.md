The [[ring]] $\mathbb{Z}$ of **integers** is the [[initial object|initial]] ring.  As an additive group, it may easily be constructed from the [[rig]] $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural numbers]] (the initial rig) as the [[Grothendieck group]] of the [[monoid]] (or [[semigroup]]) $\mathbb{N}$; the multiplicative structure is unique.

As [[sets]], $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are [[isomorphic]].  Some subcultures of mathematics (and not only set theorists) use the term 'integer' synonymously for a natural number.  Computer scientists distinguish between 'unsigned integers' (natural numbers) and 'signed integers' (integers as described here).  Translations can also cause confusion with the term 'whole number'.

In [[number theory]], one generalises integers to [[algebraic integer]]s, an instance of the [[red herring principle]].  Accordingly, some number theorists will call the integers 'rational integers' to clarify; $\mathbb{Z}$ is the ring of algebraic integers in the [[number field]] $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]].
