As an [[abelian group]], the **integers** $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[Grothendieck group]] of the [[monoid]] (or [[semigroup]]) of [[natural number]]s $\mathbb{N}$.

$$
  \mathbb{Z} = \{0\} \cup \{n, -n | n \in \mathbb{N}, n \gt 0\}
  \,.
$$

The group of natural numbers is naturally even a [[rig]] -- in fact the [[initial object|initial]] rig -- and this multiplicative structure extends to $\mathbb{Z}$ to make it a [[ring]] -- in fact the initial ring.

The underlying [[sets]] $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are [[isomorphic]]. 
Some subcultures of mathematics (and not only [[set theory|set theorists]]) use the term 'integer' synonymously for a natural number.  Computer scientists distinguish between 'unsigned integers' (natural numbers) and 'signed integers' (integers as described here).  Translations can also cause confusion with the term 'whole number'.

In [[number theory]], one generalises integers to [[algebraic integer]]s, an instance of the [[red herring principle]].  Accordingly, some number theorists will call the integers 'rational integers' to clarify; $\mathbb{Z}$ is the ring of algebraic integers in the [[number field]] $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]].
