## Idea

An __integer__ is a [[number]] that is a [[natural number]] or the [[negative number|negative]] of one.

The [[ring]] $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers may defined as the [[free group]] on one generator or as the [[initial object|initial]] [[ring]]. 

In keeping with a historical point of view in which integers are natural numbers with a sign attached, one may write 

$$
  \mathbb{Z} = \{n, -n | n \in \mathbb{N}, 0 = -0\} = \{ \ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}
  \,.
$$

From an [[nPOV]], one may consider this as follows: $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[filtered colimit]] of sets 

$$\mathbb{N} \stackrel{1 + (-)}{\to} \mathbb{N} \stackrel{1 + (-)}{\to} \mathbb{N} \stackrel{1 + (-)}{\to} \ldots$$ 

whereby $-n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is represented by the element $0$ in the $n^{th}$ copy of $\mathbb{N}$ appearing in this diagram (starting the count at the $0^{th}$ copy). The resulting induced map to the colimit 

$$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \cong \sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}: (m, n) \mapsto n-m$$ 

imparts a monoid (in fact a group) structure on $\mathbb{Z}$ descended from the monoid structure on $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$; compare double-entry bookkeeping in medieval mathematics (*[partita doppia](http://rfcwalters.blogspot.com/2011/02/mathematical-economics-double-entry.html)*). 

As a group, $\mathbb{Z}$ is [[abelian group|abelian]] and is the [[Grothendieck group]] of the [[monoid]] (or [[semigroup]]) $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural numbers]].

The monoid of natural numbers is naturally even a [[rig]] -- in fact the [[initial object|initial]] rig -- and this multiplicative structure extends to $\mathbb{Z}$ to make it a [[ring]] -- in fact the initial ring.

## In homotopy type theory

Given a [[dependent type theory]] with [[dependent product types]], [[dependent sum types]], [[identity types]], [[empty type]], [[unit type]], and [[suspension types]], the type of integers is defined as the loop space of the suspension of the suspension of the empty type:

$$\mathbb{Z} \coloneqq \Omega(\Sigma(\Sigma(\emptyset)))$$

### As higher inductive types

There are many definitions of the integers as a [[higher inductive type]]. Here we give 5 such definitions:

###### Definition
The integers are defined as the [[higher inductive type]] generated by:

 * A function $inj : \mathbf{2} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$. 
 * An identity representing that positive and negative zero are equal: $\nu_0: inj(0, 0) = inj(1, 0)$.

###### Definition

 * A term $0 : \mathbb{Z}$. 
 * A function $s : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. 
 * A function $p_1 : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. 
 * A function $p_2 : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. 
 * A dependent product of identities representing that $p_1$ is a section of $s$: 
$$\sigma: \prod_{a:\mathbb{Z}} p_1(s(a)) = a$$
 * A dependent product of identities representing that $p_2$ is a retracion of $s$: 
$$\rho: \prod_{a:\mathbb{Z}} s(p_2(a)) = a$$

## Terminology

The underlying [[sets]] $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are [[isomorphic]]. Some subcultures of mathematics (and not only [[set theory|set theorists]]) use the term 'integer' synonymously for a natural number.  Computer scientists distinguish between 'unsigned integers' (natural numbers) and 'signed integers' (integers as described here).  Translations can also cause confusion with the term 'whole number'.

In [[number theory]], one generalises integers to [[algebraic integers]], an instance of the [[red herring principle]].  Accordingly, some number theorists will call the integers '[[rational integers]]' to clarify; $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[ring of integers]] in the [[number field]] $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]].  (Compare, for example, [[Gaussian integers]] and [[Gaussian numbers]].)

The symbol '$\mathbb{Z}$' derives from the German word 'Zahlen', which is a generic word for 'numbers'.  (Compare [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]\'s use of that word in the title of his famous book on the [[foundations]] of [[real numbers]].)

Binary notation is exponentially more efficient for performing computations, but the unary notation was convenient for calculating $\pi_1(S^1)$.)
