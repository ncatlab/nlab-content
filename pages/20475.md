### For mathematical structures
 {#ForMathematicalStructure}

According to [Lawvere 1984](#Lawvere84), [[codiscrete objects]], i.e. those in the [[image]] of a [[right adjoint]] to a [[forgetful functor]], may be though of as "chaotic" with repect to whatever [[mathematical structure]] was forgotten by the forgetful functor.

This convention matches/subsumes more-or-less common  terminology such as *[[chaotic topology]]* or *[[chaotic groupoid]]*.
