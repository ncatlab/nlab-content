## Idea

An [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] is a certain cohomology class. An __orientation in differential cohomology__ (possibly shortened to somewhat cryptic _differential orientation_) is not just the orientation in the underlying generalized cohomology theory, but it has more structure, namely it is a refinement of the ordinary orientation class to a cocycle in the corresponding [[differential cohomology]].

## Examples

* For [[ordinary differential cohomology]] a differential orientation is a [[differential Thom class]]. See there for details.
