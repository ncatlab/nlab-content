## Idea

An [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] is a certain cohomology class. A _differential orientation_ is a refinement of this class to a cocycle in the corresponding [[differential cohomology]].

## Examples

* For [[ordinary differential cohomology]] a differential orientation is a [[differential Thom class]]. See there for details.
