
One may think of classical [[homotopy theory]] as the study of the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s, or rather of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$.

To every [[(∞,1)-category]] is associated its corresponding [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum]] objects. For [[Top]] this is the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]], $Sp(Top)$. **Stable homtopy theory** is the study of $Sp(Top)$, or rather of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]], the [[stable homotopy category]] $StHo(Top) := Ho(Sp(Top))$.
