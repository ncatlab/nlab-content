## Idea

_Stable homotopy theory_ is [[homotopy theory]] in the case that the operations of [[looping and delooping]] are _[[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories|equivalences]]_.

As [[homotopy theory]] is the study of [[homotopy types]], so _stable homotopy theory_ is the study of [[stable homotopy types]]. As [[homotopy theory]] in generality is [[(∞,1)-category theory]] (or maybe [[(∞,1)-topos theory]]), so stable homotopy theory in generality is the theory of [[stable (∞,1)-categories]].

More specifically, if one thinks of classical [[homotopy theory]] as the study of (just) the [[(∞,1)-category]] $L_{whe}$[[Top]] $\simeq$ [[∞Grpd]] of [[topological spaces]] modulo [[weak homotopy equivalence]] ([[∞-groupoids]]), or rather of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$, then stable homotopy theory is the study of the corresponding [[stabilization]]: To every suitable [[(∞,1)-category]] is associated its corresponding [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]]. For $L_{whe}$[[Top]] this is the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]], $Sp(L_{whe}Top)$. **Stable homotopy theory** is the study of $Sp(Top)$, or rather of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]], the [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho(Sp(L_{whe}Top))$.

For detailed introduction to the stable homotopy theory of spectra see at _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory]]_.

By definition a [[stable homotopy type]] is one on which [[suspension]] and hence [[looping and delooping]] act as an [[equivalence]]. Historically people considered in plain [[homotopy theory]] statements that became true after sufficiently many [[suspensions]], hence once the process of taking [[suspensions]] "stabilizes". Whence the name.

## Applications

### Higher algebra

The study of [[monoid object in a monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] in a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] is the [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] version of [[commutative algebra]], hence _[[higher algebra]]_ and [[higher linear algebra]].

A tool of central importance in stable homotopy theory and its application to [[higher algebra]] is the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] which allows us to describe [[A-∞ rings]] and [[E-∞ rings]] as ordinary [[monoid]] objects in a [[model category]] that presents $Sp(Top)$. ("[[brave new algebra]]").

## History
 {#History}

> Stable homotopy theory began around 1937 with the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]. $[$...$]$ Stable phenomena had of course appeared earlier, at least implicitly: [[reduced cohomology|reduced]] [[generalized homology|homology]] and [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|cohomology]] are examples of functors that are invariant under suspension without limitation on dimension.

> Stable homotopy theory emerged as a distinct branch of [[algebraic topology]] with Adams' introduction of [[Adams spectral sequence|his eponymous spectral sequence]] and his spectacular conceptual use of the notion of stable phenomena in his solution to the [[Hopf invariant one]] problem.

> Its centrality was reinforced by two related developments that occurred at very nearly the same time, in the late 1950's. One was the introduction of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized homology and cohomology theories]] and especially [[K-theory]], by Atiyah and Hirzebruch. The other was the work of Thom which showed how to reduce the problem of classifying manifolds up to cobordism to a problem, more importantly, a solvable problem, in stable homotopy theory $[$ [[Thom spectrum]] $]$.

> The reduction of geometric phenomena to solvable problems in stable homotopy theory
has remained an important mathematical theme, the most recent major success being Stolz's use of [[spin bordism|Spin cobordism]] to study the classication of manifolds with positive scalar curvature. 

> In an entirely different direction, the early 1970's saw Quillen's introduction of higher [[algebraic K-theory]] and the recognition by Segal and others that it could be viewed as a construction in stable homotopy theory. With algebraic K-theory as an intermediary, there has been a growing volume of work that relates algebraic geometry to stable homotopy theory. With Waldhausen's introduction of the algebraic K-theory of spaces in the late 1970's, stable homotopy became a bridge between algebraic K-theory and the study of diffeomorphisms of manifolds. 

> Within algebraic topology, the study of stable homotopy theory has been and remains the focus of much of the best work in the subject.
