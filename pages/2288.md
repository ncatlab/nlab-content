## Idea

One may think of classical [[homotopy theory]] as the study of the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s, or rather of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$.

To every [[(∞,1)-category]] is associated its corresponding [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum]] objects. For [[Top]] this is the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]], $Sp(Top)$. **Stable homotopy theory** is the study of $Sp(Top)$, or rather of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]], the [[stable homotopy category]] $StHo(Top) := Ho(Sp(Top))$.

A tool of major importance in stable homotopy theory and its application to [[higher algebra]] is the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] which allows us to describe [[A-∞ ring]]s and [[E-∞ ring]]s as ordinary [[monoid]] objects in a [[model category]] that presents $Sp(Top)$.

## Variations

When the spaces and spectra in question carry an [[action]] of a [[group]] $G$ the theory refines to 

* [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] .
