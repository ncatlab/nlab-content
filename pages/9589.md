## Idea

In [[noncommutative topology]] the standard notion of [[homomorphism]] of [[C*-algebras]] is too restrictive for some applications, related to the fact that some noncommutative $C^\ast$-algebras correspond to "locally badly behaved" noncommutative topological spaces. The notion of _asymptotic $C^\ast$-homomorphism_ is more flexible than that of plain $C^\ast$-homomorphisms and designed to correct this problem. Homotopy classes of asymptotic $C^\ast$-homomorphisms are the [[hom-sets]] in a [[category]] called _[[E-theory]]_. See there for more details.

## Definition

For $A,B$ two [[C*-algebras]], an **asymptotic** homomorphism between them is a $[0,\infty)$-parameterized collection of [[continuous functions]] $\{\phi_t \colon A \to B\}_{t \in [0, \infty)}$, such that

* for each $a \in A$, the [[function]] $t \mapsto \phi_t(a)$ is a [[continuous function]];

* in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] $t \to \infty$, $\phi_t$ becomes a [[star-algebra]] [[homomorphism]].
