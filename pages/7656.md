Locally internal category is a concept of a large category relative to an [[elementary topos]] which is generalizing the category of sets. 

Given a topos $E$ and an object $X$ in $E$ one notices that the slice category $E/X$ is a symmetric monoidal category; hence we can consider categories enriched over $E/X$, i.e. $E/X$-categories. 

A __locally internal category__ $C$ over $E$ is given by 

* an $E/X$-category $C_X$ for each object $X$ in $E$ (which is thought of as $X$-indexed families of objects of $E$)
* for each morphism $f: X\to Y$ in $E$ an $E/X$-ful embedding $\theta_f: f^* C_Y\to C_X$ such that $f\mapsto \theta_f$ is functorial up to coherent isomorphisms

In the [[stack semantics]] of $E$, a locally internal category "looks like" an ordinary locally small category.
