A _locally internal category_ is an analogue of a [[large category|large]] but [[locally small category]] relative to an [[elementary topos]], when that topos is thought of as generalizing the category of sets.

Given a topos $E$ and an object $X$ in $E$, one notices that the slice category $E/X$ is a symmetric monoidal category; hence we can consider categories enriched over $E/X$, i.e. $E/X$-categories. 

A __locally internal category__ $C$ over $E$ is given by 

* an $E/X$-category $C_X$ for each object $X$ in $E$ (which is thought of as being $X$-indexed families of objects of $E$)
* for each morphism $f: X\to Y$ in $E$ an $E/X$-full embedding $\theta_f: f^* C_Y\to C_X$ such that $f\mapsto \theta_f$ is functorial up to coherent isomorphisms

In the [[stack semantics]] of $E$, a locally internal category "looks like" an ordinary locally small category.

Locally internal categories can also be identified with [[Grothendieck fibrations]] or [[indexed categories]] over $E$ which satisfy a certain "representability" or "comprehensibility" condition.

Of course, $E$ does not have to be a topos.  For the definition, it suffices for $E$ to have finite limits, although the notion is best-behaved when $E$ is [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]] (for instance, in that case the [[codomain fibration]] of $E$ is an example).
