## Idea

The bosonic [[action functional]] of a [[quantum field theory]] with [[fermion]]s is often not naturally given as a [[function]] on the space of field configurations, but a [[section]] of a [[line bundle]]. (See [[fermionic path integral]]). In the absence of a [[quantum anomaly]] this line bundle is trivializable. Any choice of trivialization makes the action functional an actual function. This choice is called sometimes the _setting of the quantum integrand_ .
