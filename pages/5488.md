## Idea

In [[material set theory]] as a [[foundation of mathematics]], the axiom of pairing is an important axiom needed to get the foundations off the ground (to mix metaphors).  It states that [[unordered pairs]] exist.


## Statement

The __axiom of pairing__ (or __axiom of pairs__) states the following:

+-- {: .un_axiom}
###### Axiom (pairing)

If $x$ and $y$ are (material) sets, then there exists a set $P$ such that $x, y \in P$.
=--

Using the axiom of separation ([[bounded separation]] is enough), we can prove the existence of a particular set $P$ such that $x$ and $y$ are the *only* members of $P$.  Using the [[axiom of extensionality]], we can then prove that this set $P$ is unique; it is usually denoted $\{x,y\}$ and called the __[[unordered pair]]__ of $x$ and $y$.  Note that $\{x,x\}$ may also be denoted simply $\{x\}$.


## Generalisation

The axiom of pairing is the binary part of a [[binary/nullary pair]] whose nullary part is the axiom stating the existence of the [[empty set]].  We can use these axioms and the [[axiom of union]] to prove every instance of the following __axiom__ (or rather theorem) __schema of finite sets__:

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem (finite sets)

If $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are sets, then there exists a set $P$ such that $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in P$.
=--

Again, we can prove the existence of specific $P$ such that $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are the *only* members of $P$ and prove that this $P$ is unique; it is denoted $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ and is called the __[[finite set]]__ consisting of $x_1, \ldots, x_n$.

Note that this is a _schema_, with one instance for every (metalogical) [[natural number]].  Within axiomatic set theory, this is very different from the single statement that begins with a [[universal quantification]] over the (internal) set of natural numbers.  In particular, each instance of this schema can be stated and proved without the [[axiom of infinity]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Of course, there is one proof for each natural number.

*  For $n = 0$, this is simply the axiom of the empty set.
*  For $n = 1$, we use the axiom of pairing with $x \coloneqq x_1$ and $y \coloneqq x_1$ to construct $\{x_1\}$.
*  For $n = 2$, we use the axiom of pairing with $x \coloneqq x_1$ and $y \coloneqq x_2$ to construct $\{x_1, x_2\}$.
*  For $n = 3$, we first use the axiom of pairing twice to construct $\{x_1, x_2\}$ and $\{x_3\}$, then use pairing again to construct $\big\{\{x_1, x_2\}, \{x_3\}\big\}$, then use the axiom of union to construct $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$.
*  In general, once we have $\{x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}\}$, we use pairing to construct $\{x_n\}$, use pairing again to construct $\big\{\{x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}\}, \{x_n\}\big\}$, then use the axiom of union to construct $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$.  (A direct proof of a single statement for $n \gt 3$ can actually go faster than this; the length of the shortest proof is [[logarithmic]] in $n$ rather than linear in $n$.)

Note that these 'finite sets' are precisely the [[Kuratowski-finite sets]] in a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] treatment.
