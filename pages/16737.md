## Idea

The [[philosophy|philosophical]] sentiment which expresses the following perspective on the description of [[physics]] by [[mathematics]] might deserve to be called _universal exceptionalism_ or similar:

_Since nature (reality) is exceptional in that it has existence, it is plausible that it is the exceptional among all [[mathematical structures]] -- such as the exceptional examples in the classification of simple Lie groups, the [[exceptional Lie groups]] -- that play a role in the mathematical description of nature._

Prominent sources where this sentiment has been expressed include the following.

[Baez 95](#Baez95), in a context of the role of the [[monster group]] in physics, writes:

> one may argue that the theory of our universe must be incredibly special, since out of all the theories we can write down, just this one describes the universe that actually exists. All sorts of simpler universes apparently don't exist. So maybe the theory of the universe needs to use special, "exceptional" mathematics for some reason, even though it's complicated

[Witten 02](#Witten02), in a context of [[grand unified theory]] and [[heterotic string theory]] says:

> Describing nature by a group taken from an infinite family does raise an obvious question â€“ why this group and not another? In addition to the three infinite families, there are five [[exceptional Lie groups]], namely [[G2]], [[F4]], [[E6]], [[E7]], and [[E8]]. Since nature is so exceptional, why not describe it using an exceptional Lie group?
