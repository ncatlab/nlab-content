## Definition

A **constant functor** $\Delta(d):C\to D$ is a [[functor]] that maps each [[object]] of the [[category]] $C$ to a fixed object $d\in D$ and each morphism of $C$ to the identity morphism of that fixed object.

Note that a constant functor can be expressed as the composite
$$C \stackrel{!}{\to} 1 \stackrel{[d]}{\to} D.$$ 

Here $1$ is a [[terminal category]] (exactly one object and exactly one morphism, namely the identity), and $[d]$ denotes the unique functor from $1$ with $F(\bullet) = d$ and $F(Id_\bullet) = Id_d$. 

## Examples

* For $F$ any functor, a [[natural transformation]]

  $\Delta_d \Rightarrow F$ 

  from a constant functor into $F$ is precisely a [[cone]] over $F$. Similarly are natural transformation
  
  $F \Rightarrow \Delta_d$

  is a [[cocone]].
