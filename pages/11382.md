## Idea

The [[physics|physical]] [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ("[[general relativity]]") predicts, via [[Einstein equations|Einstein's equations of motion]], that [[vacuum]] [[spacetime]] may show a kind of oscillations of the [[field]] of [[gravity]] roughly analogous to [[electromagnetic waves]] in [[electromagnetism]]. (Both kinds of waves are oscillation of the [[field (physics)|field]] itself and do not depend on some "medium" such as a water wave does.) In fact, since the [[force]] of [[gravity]] is reflected in the [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]] of [[spacetime]], as gravitational wave is a kind of periodic distortion of spacetime geometry itself.

There has accumulated excellent indirect evidence for them from the observation of [[binary pulsars]]. Their observed rotational motion loses energy precisely to the extent that [[general relativity]] predicts is being raditated away by gravitational waves.

And tomorrow, Feb 11 2016, we'll probably hear the announcement of the first direct detection by the [[LIGO]] collaboration.
