## Idea

The [[physics|physical]] [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ("[[general relativity]]") predicts, via [[Einstein equations|Einstein's equations of motion]], that [[vacuum]] [[spacetime]] may show a kind of oscillations of the [[field]] of [[gravity]] roughly analogous to [[electromagnetic waves]] in [[electromagnetism]]. (Both kinds of waves are oscillation of the [[field (physics)|field]] itself and do not depend on some "medium" such as a water wave does.) In fact, since the [[force]] of [[gravity]] is reflected in the [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]] of [[spacetime]], a gravitational wave is a kind of periodic distortion of spacetime geometry itself.

## Experimental observation

At the end of the 20th century, there had accumulated excellent but indirect evidence for gravitational waves from the observation of [[binary pulsars]] ([Hulse-Taylor 75](#HulseTaylor75)). Their observed rotational motion loses energy precisely to the extent that [[general relativity]] predicts is being radiated away by gravitational waves.

On 11 Febrary 2016 was the announcement of the first direct detection by the [[LIGO]] collaboration, using laser interferometry, of a gravitational wave signal coming from the in-spiral and merge of a pair of [[black holes]] ([LIGO 2016](#LIGO16)). The signal was a chirp at 35-250 Hz (converted to audio in [this looped recording](https://youtu.be/TWqhUANNFXw)), detected as coming from the sky over the southern hemisphere on 14 September 2015.

Further direct detections of gravitational wave events followed. The event GW170817 [LIGO-Virgo17](LIGOVirgo17) showed gravitational waves from merging [[neutron stars]] coincident with the corresponding [[electromagnetic radiation]].

In particular this correctly stated that gravitational waves require a [[quadrupole moment]] as a [[source]] (e.g. a rotating binary star system) and not just a [[dipole moment]] (e.g. an oscillating charge) as for [[electromagnetic waves]] (the [[graviton]] has [[spin]] 2, the [[photon]] has spin 1...), thereby correcting a mistake to this effect in the earlier article
