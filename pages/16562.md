## Idea

Regarding the [[string theory|quantum string]] as a [[2-spectral triple]], it defines a [[spectral geometry]] (typically but not necessarily a [[noncommutative geometry]]) which is the [[effective field theory|effective]] [[spacetime]] as seen by this quantum string (as read of from, notably, its [[energy]] [[spectrum of a linear operator|spectrum]]). For the [[open string]] the most prominent aspect of its [[2d SCFT]] [[worldsheet]] theory are its [[boundary conditions]]. In the spectral interpretation these correspond to the presence of [[D-branes]] in the effective [[target spacetime]]. Much geometric information is contained in these D-brane states, and the resulting concept of (noncommutative) geometry has accordingly been called _D-brane geometry_ or _D-geometry_ for short.

## Examples

### Fuzzy spheres

The [[fuzzy spheres]] appear in [[D-brane geometry]]:

1. the [[fuzzy funnels]] of [[Dp-D(p+2)-brane intersections]] have [[fuzzy 2-sphere]] slices

1. the [[fuzzy funnels]] of [[Dp-D(p+4)-brane intersections]] have [[fuzzy 4-sphere]] slides

1. the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[classical field theory|classical]] solutions of the [[BMN matrix model]] are precisely [[fuzzy 2-sphere]] configurations ([BMN 02 (5.4)](BMN+matrix+model#BerensteinMaldacenaNastase02)).
