A __complete Boolean algebra__ is a [[complete lattice]] that is also a [[Boolean algebra]].  Since lattice homomorphisms of Boolean algebras automatically prefer the Boolean structure, the complete Boolean algebras form a [[full subcategory]] [[CompBoolAlg]] of [[CompLat]].

Assuming [[excluded middle]], complete *[[atom]]ic* Boolean algebras are (up to [[isomorphism]]) precisely [[power sets]].  In fact, taking power sets defines a [[fully faithful functor]] from [[Set]] to [[Comp Bool Alg]] whose [[essential image]] consiste of the complete atomic boolean algebras.  These abstract representations of power sets are important enough to have their own abbreviation: 'CABA'.

This property of CABAs is not applicable in [[constructive mathematics]], where power sets are rarely boolean algebras.  However, we can use [[discrete space|discrete]] [[locales]] instead (or rather, their corresponding [[frames]]).  That is, define a __CABA__ to be (not a complete atomic boolean algebra but) a frame $X$ such that the locale maps $X \to 1$ and $X \to X \times X$ (which in the category of frames are maps $0 \to X$ and $X + X \to X$) are [[open map|open]] (as locale maps).  Then it should be (I will check) a classical theorem that CABAs and complete atomic boolean algebras are the same, and a constructive theorem that CABAs and power sets are the same (in the same functorial manner as above).
