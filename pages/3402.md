A __complete Boolean algebra__ is a [[complete lattice]] that is also a [[Boolean algebra]].  Since lattice homomorphisms of Boolean algebras automatically prefer the Boolean structure, the complete Boolean algebras form a [[full subcategory]] of the category of complete lattices.

Assuming [[excluded middle]], complete *[[atom]]ic* Boolean algebras are (up to [[isomorphism]]) precisely [[power sets]].  These abstract representations of power sets are important enough to have their own abbreviation: 'CABA'.

It is interesting to consider whether there is a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] notion of CABA, classically equivalent to the above, which are precisely power sets even constructively.  (Such CABAs would not typically be Boolean algebras at all.)  Note that there are many complete atomic [[Heyting algebras]] (equivalently, atomic [[frames]]) that are not power sets (and not Boolean even classically).
