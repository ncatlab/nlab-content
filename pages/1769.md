## Idea

A space (in the sense of [[topology]]) is _complete_ (or _Cauchy complete_) if every [[sequence]], [[net]], or [[filter]] that should converge really does [[convergence|converge]].  We identify the sequences, nets, or filters that "should" converge as the _[[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]]_ ones.

A space that is not complete has "gaps" that may be filled to form its _completion_; it is rather natural to make the space [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] at the same time.  Forming the completion of a Hausdorff space is an important example of [[completion]] in the general sense.


## Definitions

A space (which may be a [[metric space]], a [[Cauchy space]], or anything in between) is __Cauchy complete__ if every [[Cauchy filter]] converges, equivalently if every [[Cauchy net]] converges.  A space is __sequentially complete__ if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges.  Note that a sequentially complete metric space must be complete, but this does not hold for more general spaces.

A __complete topological space__ is completely metrizable [[topological space]], that is a topological space with the [[property]] of having some compatible complete metric on it.  In other words, the [[category]] of complete topological spaces is (up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]]) the category whose objects are complete metric spaces and whose morphisms are [[continuous functions]].  This is, of course, a terrible name, since there are (for example) completely uniformizable topological spaces that do not count as complete in this sense, but it is traditional, and there are many results associated with it.


## Properties

A [[compact space]] is necessarily complete.  A space is called __precompact__ if its completion (see below) is compact.  For metric spaces (or even [[uniform space]]s), there is a natural notion of a [[totally bounded space]], and we have the theorem that a space is totally bounded if and only if it is precompact.  Similarly, a space is compact if and only if it is both complete and totally bounded (or more generally, both complete and precompact).  Thus the purely topological property of compactness is the conjunction of the nontopological properties of completeness and total boundedness.  In some [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] approaches to analysis (particularly Bishop\'s school), this is taken as the *definition* of compactness (which thereby is no longer a topological property).

+-- {: .query}
I should clarify here exactly which foundational axioms are needed to prove that a complete totally bounded space is compact in the localic sense (the converse is easy) and why some constructivists actually accept this theorem and therefore have no need to redefine 'compact'.  ---Toby

## Completion

The set $\mathcal{C}X$ of Cauchy filters on a space $X$ may naturally be given the same sort of structure as $X$ itself has, and this space will be complete.  Exactly how to do this depends on what structure $X$ is supposed to have, of course (and one can make the statement false in general by requiring something artificial as the structure in question, most extremely the structure of being a specific non-complete space).  But the general idea is this: every point in $X$ generates a principal [[ultrafilter]] (consisting of those sets to which the point belongs), so there is a natural map from $X$ to $\mathcal{C}X$.  Furthermore, this map is a morphism of the appropriate structure, which in particular makes it [[Cauchy-continuous map|Cauchy-continuous]] (preserving Cauchy filters) and continuous (preserving limits).  So all of the limits in $X$ still exist in $\mathcal{C}X$, but now each Cauchy filter in $X$ (having become a Cauchy filter in $\mathcal{C}$) has a limit as well.  There is a problem that $\mathcal{C}X$ is rather larger than necessary; for example, all of the filters that converge to a give point in $X$ (not just the free ultrafilter at that point) exist in $\mathcal{C}X$ and converge to one another.  But you can take a quotient of $\mathcal{C}X$ to make it Hausdorff or (especially if $X$ was not Hausdorff to begin with) to leave in just as much redundancy as $X$ has but no more.

(details to come, if I get around to it)


We have a picture like this, where $X$ is the original space, $\mathcal{H}$ gives a Hausdorff quotient, and an overline indicates completion:
$$ \array {
  &                 & \overline{X} \\
  & \hookrightarrow &              & &#x21A0; \\
X &                 &              &                 & \mathcal{H}\overline{X} \cong \overline{\mathcal{H}X} \\
  & &#x21A0;        &              & \hookrightarrow \\
  &                 & \mathcal{H}X
} $$
(Here the arrows are drawn horizontally to put styles on them; they should all be diagonal in the only possible way.)

If $X$ is a [[metric space]], then we can also construct its completion as a [[locale]], the [[localic completion]], whose spatial part is the above space, but which in [[constructive mathematics]] may not be spatial.


## Generalisation

When [[Bill Lawvere]] interpreted (in [tac](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/1/tr1abs.html), 1986) [[metric space]]s as certain [[enriched categories]], he found that a metric space was complete if and only if every [[adjunction]] of [[bimodule]]s over the enriched category is induced by an [[enriched functor]].  Accordingly, this becomes the notion of [[Cauchy complete category]].  (Note that one *must* say 'Cauchy' here, since this is *weaker* than being a [[complete category]], which is based on an incompatible analogy.)
