## Idea

A [[space]] (with "space" taken in a sense relevant to the field of [[topology]]) is _complete_ (or _Cauchy-complete_) if every [[sequence]], [[net]], or [[filter]] that should converge really does [[convergence|converge]].  We identify the sequences, nets, or filters that "should" converge as the _[[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]]_ ones.

A space that is not complete has "gaps" that may be filled to form its _completion_; it is rather natural to make the space (or equivalently its underlying topological space) [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] at the same time.  Forming the completion of a Hausdorff space is an important example of [[completion]] in the general abstract sense. 


## Definitions

A space (which may be a [[metric space]], a [[Cauchy space]], or anything in between) is __Cauchy-complete__, or simply __complete__, if every [[Cauchy filter]] converges, equivalently if every [[Cauchy net]] converges.  A space is __sequentially complete__ if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges.  Note that a sequentially complete metric space must be complete (in [[classical mathematics]]), but this does not hold for more general spaces (nor even for metric spaces in [[constructive mathematics]]).

A space is __topologically complete__ if its [[underlying topological space]] is completely [[metrizable space|metrizable]].  There are various other notions related to this.  See [[topologically complete space]].


## Completion

The set $\mathcal{C}X$ of Cauchy filters on a space $X$ may generally be given the same sort of structure as $X$ itself has, and this space will be complete.  Exactly how to do this depends on what structure $X$ is supposed to have, of course, and one can make the general statement false by requiring something artificial as the structure in question, most extremely the structure of being a specific non-complete space.  But it works for most natural categories of spaces.

The general idea is this: every point in $X$ generates a principal [[ultrafilter]] (consisting of those sets to which the point belongs), so there is a natural map from $X$ to $\mathcal{C}X$.  Furthermore, this map is a morphism of the appropriate structure, which in particular makes it [[Cauchy-continuous map|Cauchy-continuous]] (preserving Cauchy filters) and continuous (preserving limits).  So all of the limits in $X$ still exist in $\mathcal{C}X$, but now each Cauchy filter in $X$ (having become both a Cauchy filter in $\mathcal{C}$ and a point in $\mathcal{C}$) has a limit as well.  The additional Cauchy filters based on the additional points in $\mathcal{C}X$ will also have a limit in $\mathcal{C}X$, essentially because $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[monad]] (so a Cauchy filter of Cauchy filters folds into a single Cauchy filter).

There is a problem that $\mathcal{C}X$ is rather larger than necessary; for example, all of the filters that converge to a given point in $X$ (not just the free ultrafilter at that point) exist in $\mathcal{C}X$ and converge to one another.  But you can take a [[quotient space|quotient]] of $\mathcal{C}X$ to make it Hausdorff, obtaining the __Hausdorff completion__ of $X$.  In case $X$ was not Hausdorff to begin with, one can sometimes also force the quotient to leave in just as much redundancy as $X$ has but no more, obtain a straight __completion__ of $X$.  But really, it\'s most natural to make the space Hausdorff at the same time.

Details to come, if I get around to it.

We have a picture like this, where $X$ is the original space, $\mathcal{H}$ gives a Hausdorff quotient, and an overline indicates completion:
$$ \array {
  &                 & \overline{X} \\
  & \hookrightarrow &              & &#x21A0; \\
X &                 &              &                 & \mathcal{H}\overline{X} \cong \overline{\mathcal{H}X} \\
  & &#x21A0;        &              & \hookrightarrow \\
  &                 & \mathcal{H}X
} $$
(Here the arrows are drawn horizontally to put styles on them; they should all be diagonal in the only possible way.)

At least if $X$ is a [[metric space]], then we can also construct its completion as a [[locale]], the [[localic completion]], whose spatial part is the above space, but which in [[constructive mathematics]] may not be spatial.  This is useful to have even if $X$ is already complete.


## Properties

### Relation to compact spaces

A [[compact space]] is necessarily complete.  A space is called __precompact__ if its completion is compact.  For metric spaces (or even [[uniform spaces]]), there is a natural notion of a [[totally bounded space]]; in [[classical mathematics]], we have the theorem that a space is totally bounded if and only if it is precompact.  Similarly, a space is compact if and only if it is both complete and totally bounded (or in [[constructive mathematics]], both complete and precompact).  Thus the purely topological property of compactness is the conjunction of the nontopological properties of completeness and total boundedness.

In some [[constructive analysis|constructive approaches to analysis]] (including most of Brouwer\'s school and some of Bishop\'s school), ‘complete and totally bounded’ is taken as the *definition* of ‘compact’, because it holds of examples such as the [[unit interval]] that fail to be compact (in the usual sense) without the [[fan theorem]].  However, in this case, compactness is no longer a [[topological property]].  This is reconciled somewhat with the theory of [[localic completion]], in which a uniform space is totally bounded if and only if its localic completion is compact (in the usual sense).


### Relation to Baire spaces

Every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]].  Since being a Baire space is a [[topological property]], it follows that every [[topologically complete space]] is a Baire space.

Are there (necessarily nonmetrizable) complete uniform spaces that are not Baire spaces?
=--

There is also a topological property of [[Cech-complete space|Čech-completeness]] that is related  to this; in particular, a metric space is Čech-complete if and only if it is complete, and every Čech-complete space is a Baire space.  In general, we have these proper implications: topologically complete → Čech-complete → Baire.


## Generalization

When [[Bill Lawvere]] interpreted (in [Lawvere 1973](#Lawvere1973)) [[metric spaces]] as certain [[enriched categories]], he found that a metric space was complete if and only if every [[adjunction]] of [[bimodules]] over the enriched category is induced by an [[enriched functor]].  Accordingly, this becomes the notion of [[Cauchy-complete category]].  (Note that one *must* say 'Cauchy' here, since this is *weaker* than being a [[complete category]], which is based on an incompatible analogy.)
