
In [[probability theory]], __Bayes\'s Rule__ (or __Bayes\' Theorem__ or other variations) is the statement in [[conditional probability]] that

$$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)} {P(E)} ,$$

which follows directly from the formula $P(A|B) = P(A \wedge B)/P(B)$ for conditional probability.  Sometimes the rule is written in a more expanded form

$$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)} {P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg{H}) - P(E|\neg{H}) P(H)} ,$$

which additionally uses some of the axioms of probability.

As a theorem, it is quite trivial; the point is in its application as a rule for updating the probability of some hypothesis ($H$) on the basis of some evidence ($E$) (which is key to [[Bayesianism]]), using the _prior_ probability of the hypothesis before the evidence is obtained ($P(H)$) and (in the expanded form) the conditional probabilities of obtaining that evidence in the situation where the hypothesis is true ($P(E|H)$) and in the situation where the hypothesis is false ($P(E|\neg{H})$).  (Ideally, the latter two can be determined on a purely theoretical basis, but since the probability of $E$ usually depends on other hypotheses of unknown veracity, the application is not always so simple.)

In the [[Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics]] (and more generally in $\psi$-[[epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics|epistemic]] [[interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]]), the [[collapse of the wavefunction]] can be seen as a generalization of Bayes\'s Rule to [[quantum probability theory]].
