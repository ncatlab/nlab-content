## Idea ##

In [[higher category theory]] an _$(\infty,n)$-category_ may be thought of as

* an [[n-category]] up to [[coherence|coherent]] [[homotopy]];

* [[(n,r)-category|(r,n)-category]] for $r = \infty$;

* a [[weak omega-category]] for which all [[k-morphisms]] with $k \gt n$ are [[equivalences]].

There are two main [[recursion|recursive]] definitions of $(\infty,n)$-categories: by iterated [[enriched (∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-enrichment]]

$$
  Cat_{(\infty,n)} \simeq (\cdots((Cat_{(\infty,0)} Cat) Cat) \cdots) Cat
$$ 

and by iterated [[category object in an (∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-internalization]]

$$
  Cat_{(\infty,n)} \simeq Cat(\cdots(Cat(Cat_{(\infty,0)}))\cdots)
  \,.
$$

There is also a fairly simple axiomatization of the [[(∞,1)-category]] $Cat_{(\infty,n)}$ itself, as something _generated_ by [[strict n-categories]]. 

Then there is a plethora of [[model category]] structures that [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] $Cat_{(\infty,n)}$.

## Introduction

Here are some introductory words for readers unfamiliar with the general idea. Other readers should skip [ahead](#Definition).



### For 1-category theorists
 {#1CatIntro}

This section assumes that the reader is well familiar with [[category theory]] and maybe with [[strict omega-categories]] but in need of some introductory words on $(\infty,n)$-categories.

Ordinary [[category theory]] provides various powerful tools for generating higher order structures, among them notably

1. [[enriched category theory|enrichment]]

1. [[internalization]].

Here we are interested in higher order _[[categories]]_, so weconsider [[Cat]] itself as a 1-categorical context for either of these procedures. Since [[Cat]] naturally a [[cartesian monoidal category]] 

$$
  (\mathcal{V}, \otimes) \coloneqq (Cat, \times)
$$ 

we may form the [[category of V-enriched categories]] $\mathcal{V}Cat \coloneqq Cat Cat$. A $Cat$-category consists of

* a collection of [[objects]];

* for each pair of objects $A$, $B$ a _category_ of morphisms, hence to be thought of as collection of ordinary morphisms $A \to B$ together with _morphisms between these morphisms_: [[2-morphisms]];

* such that composition is a _functor_ on these hom-categories.

This is the structure of a _[[strict 2-category]]_. We have that

$$
  Cat Cat \simeq Str 2 Cat
  \,.
$$

is the category of strict 2-categories.

By general results of [[enriched category theory]] (or by immediate inspection), this is still a [[cartesian monoidal category]] and so we may iterate this and consider now the enriching category

$$
  (\mathcal{V}, \otimes) \coloneqq (Cat Cat, \times)
$$

and construct again $\mathcal{V}Cat$, which now is

$$
  (Cat Cat) Cat \simeq Str 3 Cat
$$

the category of strict _[[3-categories]]_. It continues this way, and so for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the $n$-fold iterated enrichment of $Cat$ is the category 

$$
  Str n Cat \simeq  (\cdots ((Cat Cat)Cat) \cdots) Cat
$$

of _[[strict n-categories]]_. The [[inductive limit]] of this construction finally is the category of [[strict omega-categories]].

While this easily generates [[higher category theory|higher categorical structures]], it does so, as the terminology indicates, only in a very restrictive way: while every [[2-category]] still happens to be [[equivalence of 2-categories|equivalent]] to a [[strict 2-category]], already the general [[3-category]] is no longer equivalent to a strict 3-category, and the discrepancy only increases with $n$.

But inspection in the case of [[2-categories]] already shows what the problem is: in a [[bicategory|weak 2-category]] structural relations such as [[associativity]] and [[unitality]] no longer hold as equations but only _up to_ an _invertible_ [[2-morphism]], whereas objects in  $Str 2 Cat \simeq Cat Cat$, by definition of [[enriched category]], satisfy these relations _strictly_ -- therefore the name. 

But this problem directly corresponds to an evident shortcoming of the very starting point of the above recursive construction: that construction regarded [[Cat]] as a 1-category in order to fit it into the standard formulation of [[enriched category theory]]; however [[Cat]] is naturally rather a [[2-category]] itself. The enrichment procedure should be allowed to make use of this extra structure. On the other hand, as we have just seen, the failure of $Cat Cat$ to model all of [[2Cat]] is only in the lack of _invertible_ 2-morphisms. Therefore what should really matter for the improved enrichment is just the [[(2,1)-category]] underlying [[Cat]], which is the 2-category consisting of all [[categories]], all [[functors]] between them, but only _[[natural isomorphism]]_ instead of all [[natural transformations]] between those.

This way one does arrive at a suitable refined notion of enrichment over the [[(2,1)-category]] $Cat$, and interpreted this way one does finds that $Cat Cat$ then indeed produces all of [[2Cat]].

However, this only fixed the first step of the above recursive definition. In the next step we want $(2 Cat)Cat$ to produce all [[3-categories]], but their associativity and unitalness now involves invertible [[coherence]] _[[3-morphisms]]_ which do not appear in enriched $(2,1)$-category theory. And so on, as the recursion proceeds.

This shows that the natural starting point for a construction of [[n-categories]] by recursive enrichment must be a conception of 1-[[category theory]] which knows already about _invertible_ [[k-morphisms]] for all $k$. The notion of category where all 1-categorical operations are relaxed up to _invertible_ higher morphisms is that of _[[(∞,1)-category]]_. And this now turns out to be a good starting point for producing $n$-categories by recursive enrichment. 

If we then just replace in the above the naive [[Cat]] with [[(∞,1)Cat]], then the simple formula

$$
  Cat_{(\infty,n)} \coloneq (\cdots ((Cat_{(\infty,1)} Cat_{(\infty,1)})Cat_{(\infty,1)}) \cdots) Cat_{(\infty,1)}
$$

does produce a good general notion of $n$-categories, these are the _$(\infty,n)$-categories_ discussed here.

There is also an alternative road to the same conclusion: another standard procedure for producing higher order structures from the 1-category [[Cat]] is to consider [[internal categories]] in $Cat$. For $E$ a category with [[finite limits]], write $Cat(E)$ for the category of $E$-[[internal categories]], and hence $Cat(Cat)$ for the category of $Cat$-internal categories.

This gives _[[double categories]]_

$$
  DoubleCat \simeq Cat(Cat)
$$

and hence again not quite the [[2-categories]] that we are after. But it is of interest to note that now there are _two_ problems, not just the one above: while a $Cat$-internal category again has strict [[associativity]] and [[unitality]], instead of the desired version up to an invertible 2-morphism, in another direction it is more general than a [[strict 2-category]]: the latter only corresponds to those special double categories for which the "vertical" and the "horizontal" 1-morphisms come from the same 1-category and have sufficiently many degenerate 2-morphisms between them.

The first problem turns out to be solved as before: instead of working with the 1-category [[Cat]] we should already regard that as a [[(2,1)-category]] and then formulate _internal (2,1)-categories_ in straightforward generalization of the ordinary notion. For the second problem it turns out that one needs to slightly enhance that straightforward generalization and add a condition known (somewhat undescriptively) as _[[complete Segal space|completeness]]_. But if this is understood then (as discussed in detail at [[internal category in an (∞,1)-category]]) the simple idea of iterated internalization does work out and we obtain $(\infty,n)$-categories by

$$
  Cat_{(\infty,n)} \simeq Cat(\cdots(Cat(Cat_{(\infty,0)}))\cdots)
  \,.
$$





### For homotopy theorists
 {#HomotopyIntro}

This section assumes that the reader is well familiar with [[homotopy theory]] and maybe with [[(∞,1)-category theory]] but in need of some introductory words on $(\infty,n)$-categories.

(...)


## Definitions
 {#Definition}

There are various different ways of defining $(\infty,n)$-categories, which are all natural in their own right, and all equivalent to each other. 

There is an axiomatic characterization of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of $(\infty,n)$-categories by [[generators and relations|generation]] from [[strict n-categories]]:
 
* [Definition via generation from strict n-categories](#AxiomaticCharacterization)

Among the more direct definitions of $(\infty,n)$-categories one can roughly distinguish two flavors, those that build $(\infty,n)$-categories by _[[enriched category|enrichment]]_ over $(\infty,n-1)$-categories

* [Definitions via enrichment](#ViaEnrichment)

and those that build them by [[internalization]] in the collection of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories

* [Definitions via internalization](#ViaInternalization).



### Via generation by strict $n$-categories
 {#AxiomaticCharacterization}

We discuss a characterization of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of $(\infty,n)$-categories as an $(\infty,1)$-category [[generators and relations|generated]] by [[strict n-categories]], due to ([Barwick, Schommer-Pries](#BarwickSchommerPries)).

#### Preliminaries

The main definition is def. \ref{AxiomaticDefinition} below, which roughly says that the collection of $(\infty,n)$-categories is _generated_ from [[strict n-categories]] in a certain sense. Therefore we first need to fix some terminology and notions about strict $n$-categories and about the relevant notion of generation.

+-- {: .num_defn #GauntStrictNCategories}
###### Definition

Write $Str n Cat$ for the 1-[[category]] of [[strict n-categories]]. Write
$Str n Cat_{gaunt} \hookrightarrow  Str n Cat$ for the [[full subcategory]] on the _gaunt $n$-categories_, those $n$-categories whose only invertible [[k-morphisms]] are the identities.

=--

This subcategory was considered in ([Rezk](#Rezk)). The term "gaunt" is due to ([Barwick, Schommer-Pries](#BarwickSchommerPries)).

+-- {: .num_example #Globes}
###### Example

For $k \leq n $ the $k$-[[globe]] is gaunt, $G_k \in Str n Cat_{gaunt} \hookrightarrow \in Str n Cat$.

Write

$$
  \mathbb{G}_{\leq n} \hookrightarrow Str n Cat_{gaunt}
$$

for the [[full subcategory]] of the [[globe category]] on the $k$-globes for $k \leq n$.

Being a [[subobject]] of a gaunt $n$-category, also the [[boundary]] of a globe $\partial G_k \hookrightarrow G_k$ is gaunt, i.e. the $(k-1)$-[[skeleton]] of $G_k$.

+-- {: .num_defn #nCatGen}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  Str n Cat_{gen} \hookrightarrow Str n Cat_{gaunt}
$$

for the smallest [[full subcategory]] that 

1. contains the [[globe category]] $\mathbb{G}_{\leq n}$, example \ref{Globes};
1. is closed under [[retracts]] in $Str n Cat_{gaunt}$; 
1. has all [[fiber products]] over [[globes]].

+-- {: .num_defn #FundamentalPushouts}
###### Definition

The following [[pushout]] identities in $Str n Cat$ we call the _fundamental pushouts_ in the following

1. Gluing two $k$-globes along their boundary gives the boundary of the $(k+1)$-globle

   $G_k \coprod_{\partial C_{k-1}} G_k \simeq \partial G_{k+1}$

1. Gluing two $k$-globes along an $i$-face gives a [[pasting]] composition of the two globles

   $G_k \coprod_{G_i} G_k$

1. The [[fiber product]] of globes along non-degenerate morphisms $G_{i+j} \to G_i$ and $G_{i+k} \to G_i$ is built from gluing of globes by

   $$
     G_{i+j} \times_{G_i} G_{i+k}
     \simeq
     (G_{i+j} \coprod_{G_i} G_{i+k}) \coprod_{\sigma^{i+1}(G_{j-1} \times G_{k-1})} (G_{i+k} \coprod_{G_i} G_{i+j})

$$

_strongly generates_ $\mathcal{D}$ if its $(\infty,1)$-[[Yoneda extension]] on the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]]

###### Definition

An **$(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories** $Cat_{(\infty,n)}$ is an [[(∞,1)-category]] equipped with a [[full and faithful functor]] 

$$
  i :  Str n Cat_{gen} \hookrightarrow \tau_{\leq 0}Cat_{(\infty,n)}
$$ 

from the generating strict $n$-categories, def. \ref{nCatGen} into its category of [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|0-truncated]] objects, such that 

1. $\mathcal{Y}_n \to \tau_{\leq 0} Cat_{(\infty,n)} \hookrightarrow Cat_{(\infty,n)} $ [strongly generates](#StrongGeneration) $\mathcal{C}$;

1. $i$ preserves the [fundamental pushouts](#FundamentalPushouts);
   and sends (...) to an equivalence.

1. the [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]] in $Cat_{(\infty,n)}$ exists along morphisms with codomain in the image of $i$;

and such that $\mathcal{C}$ is [[universal property|universal]] with respect to these properties in that for any other $j : Str n Cat_{gen} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ satisfying these three conditions it factors through $i$

$$
  j : Str n Cat \stackrel{i}{\to} Cat_{(\infty,n)} \stackrel{L}{\to} \mathcal{C}
$$

by an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $L$ which is the reflector of a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflective inclusion]] $\mathcal{C} \hookrightarrow Cat_{(\infty,n)}$.

###### Remark

By the first axiom, the localization demanded in the universal property is essentially unique. In particular, therefore, $Cat_{(\infty,n)}$ is defined uniquely, up to [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]].

#### Presentation

By def. \ref{AxiomaticDefinition} $Cat_{(\infty,n)}$ is [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] to a [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on $Str n Cat_{gen}$. In fact, various subcategories of $Str n Cat_{gen}$ are already sufficient. Here we discuss these [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentations]].

The three axioms of def. \ref{AxiomaticDefinition} are satisfied effectively by construction  of $S$ (...). Conversely, every localization satisfying the second and third axiom must invert the morphisms in $S$, hence must be a sub-localization.

* [[(∞,1)-category]]
* [[(∞,2)-category]]

In addition,

* In particular, [[n-categories]] = $(n,n)$-categories can be so obtained. 



### Specific examples

* One motivating example for $(\infty,n)$-categories is the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] which plays a central role in the formalization of the [[cobordism hypothesis]]. 

* Another class of examples are [[(∞,n)-categories of spans]].
