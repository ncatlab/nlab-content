#Idea#

Combining the idea of $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] with that of $n$-[[n-category|category]], an $(\infty,n)$-category is supposed to be an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] which behaves like its $k$-morphisms for $k \gt n$ are all [[equivalence]]s. See [[(n,r)-category]].

#Idea in terms of complete Segal spaces#

One definition buidling on that of [[(infinity,1)-category]] in terms of [[complete Segal space]]s was given in 2005 by Clark Barwick and recently put to use and popularized by Jacob Lurie in [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]].

Due to this definition an $(\infty,n)$-category is an [[n-fold complete Segal space]].

#Special cases#

* [[infinity-groupoid]] = $(\infty,0)$-category
* [[(infinity,1)-category]]
* [[(infinity,2)-category]]
* etc ...
* [[infinity-category]] = $(\infty,\infty)$-category


#Examples#

The motivating example for $(\infty,n)$-categories is the [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]] which plays a central role in the formalization of the [[cobordism hypothesis]].
