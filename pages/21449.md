## Idea

In [[physics]], the _backreaction_ of an object or [[field configuration]] is its effect on other objects/fields by their mutual [[interaction]].

Typically one speaks of backreaction only in situations where it has (previously) been _neglected_, in that all other fields have been regarded as a fixed [[background field]] for the given object/field. Given such a situation of a field in a [[background field]] one may then ask what the backreaction of the former on the latter is or would have been.

## Examples

### Particle mechanics

The orbit of an [[electron]] around a [[nucleus]] or of a planet around the sun is to good approximation computed by taking into account the [[force]] that the nucleus/sun exerts on the electron/planet, but neglecting the (much smaller) force exerted by the electron/planet on the nucleus/sun. The latter force is the _backreaction_; and one will speak about taking it into account or not.

### Cosmic inhomogeneities

Not all backreaction considered is between small and large point masses. 

For example, in [[inhomogeneous cosmology]] one speaks about the backreaction (or not) of inhomogeneities in the matter density filling the [[observable universe]] on the [[gravitational field]] filling the universe.

### Branes

In [[string theory]] one speaks of _[[probe branes]]_ when the backreaction of a small number of [[branes]] on some large number of background [[black branes]] is neglected.
