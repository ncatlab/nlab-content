A _pro-manifold_ is a [[pro-object]] in a [[category]] of [[manifolds]], i.e. a formal [[projective limit]] of [[manifolds]].

Details depend on what exactly is understood by "[[manifold]]", i.e. wether [[topological manifolds]] or [[smooth manifold]], etc. 

Typically one wants to mean [[pro-objects]] in manifolds of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimensions]], the point being then that a pro-manifold is like an [[infinite-dimensional manifold]] but with "mild" infinite dimensionality, expressed by the very fact that it may be presented as a formal projective limit of finite dimensional manifolds.

To amplify this specification, one should properly speak of "pro-(finite dimensional smooth manifolds)", but beware that people often abbreviate to "pro-manifold" regardless. Also "pro-finite manifold" is in use, which however, strictly speaking, is a misnomer since a "finite manifold" is one with a [[finite number]] of points.

An important example of pro-objects in finite-dimensional smooth manifolds are infinite [[jet bundles]]. These are the formal projective limits of the underlying finite jet bundles.
