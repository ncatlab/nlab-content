## Idea

A [[2d superconformal field theory]] in which the holomorphic sector (the "right movers") has $N=2$ [[supersymmetry]], while the antiholomorphic sector (the "left movers") has no supersymmetry (or the other way around), is traditionally denoted as $N = (2,0)$ supersymmetry. The [[topological twist]] of this is also called the _[[half-twisted model]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to the heterotic string

In contrast, the [[heterotic string]] [[worldsheet]] [[2d SCFT]] a priori has only $N = (1,0)$ supersymmetry, while the [[type II superstring]] similarly has $N = (1,1)$. But for suitable [[target spaces]] and [[background gauge fields]] the [[supersymmetry]] of the heterotic string is enhanced.

In ([BDFF 88](#BDFF88)) it was shown that this enhancement of the $N=(1,0)$-superconformal worldsheet theory of the [[heterotic string]] to an $N=(2,0)$-superconformal theory happens precisely when the corresponding [[target space]] [[effective quantum field theory]] itself has $N=1$ [[supersymmetry]]. This in turn is the case notably when the target is a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]], for more on this see at _[[supersymmetry and Calabi-Yau manifolds]]_.

So to the extent that $N=1$ target space supersymmetry is regarded as important in [[string phenomenology]] (it used to be regarded as highly important but with the failure of the [[LHC]] [[experiment]] to detect evidence reflecting this assumption, this may be changing), then 2d $(2,0)$-superconfromal QFTs define the relevant [[heterotic string]] theory [[vacua]].

### Relation to topological strings and sheaves of quantum observables

The enhanced [[supersymmetry]] of the $2d$ $(2,0)$-models allows to consider the corresponding [[topological twist]] ([Kapustin 05](#Kapustin05), [Witten 05](#Kapustin05)). The resulting topologically twisted 2d (2,0)-model is on the one hand amenable to detailed mathematical analysis, since its [[quantum observables]] for the [[chiral de Rham complex]] [[sheaf of vertex operator algebras]] (see ([Malikov 06](#Malikov06)) for a mathematical treatment) and at the same time is argued to still detect important properties of the original geometric model, such as notably the [[Witten genus]].
