## Idea 


The concept of _[[resolution]]_ in [[homotopy theory]] specialized to [[simplicial homotopy theory]] is "simplicial resoltion".

> the following needs attention

In any ambient [[category]] or $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] $C$ that admits a notion of 
[[colimit]] or [[weak limit|weak colimit]], a _simplicial resolution_
of an object $c \in C$ is a [[simplicial object]] 
$y_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to C$ such that it realizes $c$ as a colimit

$$
  c \simeq colim_{[k]} y_k
  \,.
$$

The term is also used for a [[Reedy model structure|Reedy fibrant]] replacement of a constant simplicial object in a [[model category]]; see also [[resolution]].

## Examples 

* In an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] [[ÄŒech cover]] $C(U) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X$
  induced by a [[cover]] $(U = \coprod_i U_i) \to X$ is a simplicial resolution of $X$.

[[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinity,1)-categories]] are discussed in section 6.1.4 of
