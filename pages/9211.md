## Definition

Let $k$ be a given [[field]], and let $C$ be a $k$-linear [[abelian category]]. Then $C$ is said to be *finite* (over $k$) if 

* For any two objects $a$, $b$ of $C$, the $k$-[[vector space]] $\hom(a, b)$ has [[finite]] [[dimension]]; 

* Each object $a$ is of [[object of finite length|finite length]]; 

* There are only finitely many [[simple objects]] in $C$, and each of them admits a [[projective presentation]].

###### Theorem (Deligne)

For any finite abelian category $C$, there exists a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra and an $k$-linear equivalence between $C$ and $A$-$Mod_{fd}$, the category of $A$-modules that are finite-dimensional as vector spaces over $k$.
