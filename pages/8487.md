## Idea

The _parenthesized braid operad_ is an [[operad]] in [[Grpd]] modelled on the [[braid group]].

## Definition

For any [[integer]] $n\geq 1$, let $PaB_n$ be the [[groupoid]] defined as follows:
* its [[objects]] are parenthesized [[permutations]] of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, that is non-associative, non-commutative monomials on this set in which every letter appears exactly once.
* [[morphisms]] between two objects $s,t$ are braids connecting each letter in $s$ to the same letter in $t$. In other words, let $p:B_n\rightarrow S_n$ be the canonical projection from the braid group to the symmetric group whose kernel is the pure braid group. Then, forgetting the parenthesization and viewing $s,t$ as permutations:

$$Hom(s,t)=p^{-1}(\{s^{-1}t\})$$

Then the collection $PaB$ of the $PaB_n$'s is an [[operad]]. The composition

$$\circ_i:PaB_n \times PaB_m \rightarrow PaB_{m+n-1}$$

is given by replacing the $i$th strand of the first braid, by the second braid made very thin.

$PaB$ also have an obvious structure of a [[braided monoidal category]]. In fact:

###### Theorem

$PaB$ is an [[initial object]] in the [[category]] of 
[[braided monoidal categories]].

A topological interpretation of $PaB$ is as follows:

###### Theorem

$PaB$ may be identified with a full sub-operad of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of the [[little 2-disk operad]].
