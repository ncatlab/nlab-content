## Idea

The _parenthesized braid operad_ is an [[operad]] in [[Grpd]] modelled on the [[braid group]].

## Definition

Let $PaB$ be the category defined as follows:
* its set of [[objects]] is the [[free magma]] on one generator, or equivalently the set of [[rooted binary tree]]s.
* the set of morphisms between two objects $s,t$ is given by the braid group $B_n$ whenever $s$ and $t$ are words of the same legnth $n$, and is empty otherwise.

Then the collection $PaB$ of the $PaB_n$'s is a [[braided operad]]. The composition

$$\circ_i:PaB_n \times PaB_m \rightarrow PaB_{m+n-1}$$

is given by replacing the $i$th strand of the first braid, by the second braid made very thin.

$PaB$ also have an obvious structure of a [[braided monoidal category]]. In fact:

###### Theorem

$PaB$ is the [[free object|free]] braided monoidal category on one object. As a consequence, it is an [[initial object]] in the [[category]] of 
[[braided monoidal categories]].

## Colored/ordered version

let $CPaB_n$ be the [[groupoid]] defined as follows:
* it set  [[objects]] are parenthesized [[permutations]] of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, that is non-associative, non-commutative monomials on this set in which every letter appears exactly once.
* [[morphisms]] between two objects $s,t$ are braids connecting each letter in $s$ to the same letter in $t$. In other words, let $p:B_n\rightarrow S_n$ be the canonical projection from the braid group to the symmetric group whose kernel is the pure braid group. Then, forgetting the parenthesization and viewing $s,t$ as permutations:

$$Hom(s,t)=p^{-1}(\{s^{-1}t\})$$

Then $CPaB$ is an (ordinary) [[operad]], the operadic structure being the same as for the non-colored version.

A topological interpretation of $CPaB$ is as follows:

###### Theorem

$CPaB$ may be identified with a full sub-operad of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of the [[little 2-disk operad]].
