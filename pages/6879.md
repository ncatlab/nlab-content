## Idea

A [[classical field theory]] with [[action functional]] having the standard kinetic term non-derivative interactions has stable, time-independent solutions where all fields are constant on a value that is a local minimum of the interaction term potential energy (if any). 

In the corresponding [[quantum field theory]], however, a state that is initially concentrated this way on a local minimum which is not also a global minimum is not time-independent, but will exhibit [[quantum tunneling]] behaviour by which the fields "tunnel" through the local potential barrier into the global minimum. Therefore one speaks of a _false [[vacuum]]_ in this case.
