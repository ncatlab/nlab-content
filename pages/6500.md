The aim of analytic Langlands program is to find a theory of analytic motives that gives a full correspondence between all (not only algebraic) automorphic representations and all analytic motives.

There are many interesting automorphic representation that have nothing very clear to do with algebraic varieties (Mass forms, etc...). They should however be related to natural analytic motivic coefficients.
