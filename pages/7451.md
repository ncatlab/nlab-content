###### Definition

In a category a commutative square

$$\array{q&\to &a\\\downarrow&&\downarrow\\b&\to &c}$$

is called an **epi-pullback-** or **quasi-pullback-** or **epi cartesian-square ** if the induced morphism $q\to a\times_c b$ is an [[epimorphism]]. The object $q$ is then called an **epi-pullback** or **quasi-pullback** of the span $b\to c\leftarrow a$.

###### Remark
For a topos $T$ and $T^I$ its arrow category which is a topos, epi-pullback squares (in $T$) form a [[class of open maps]] in $T^I$.
