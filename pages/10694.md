## Idea

The _May spectral sequence_ is a [[spectral sequence]] used to compute the first page of the [[classical Adams spectral sequence]].

It may be regarded as the spectral sequence obtained by filtering the (dual) [[Steenrod algebra]] by (co)powers of the unit (co)ideal. (see [Ravenel 86, chapter 3, section 2](#Ravenel86), [Kochman 96, section 5.3](#Kochman96))
