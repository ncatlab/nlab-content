## Introduction ##

_Globular_ is a web-based [[proof assistant]] for [[semistrict]] [[globular set|globular]] [[higher categories]]. It allows one to formalize higher-categorical proofs in finitely-presented [[n-categories]], visualize them as [[string diagrams]], and share them with collaborators, or with the world.

It currently operates up to the level 3-categories. By the yoga of [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]], this also allows one to construct proofs in monoidal 2-categories and braided monoidal 1-categories. An extension to 4-categories is actively in development.

The model of [[semistrict]] higher categories that _Globular_ uses puts all the weak structures in the interchangers, and higher associated structures. For [[3-categories]], this means that _Globular_ implements the axioms of a [[Gray category]].

_Globular_ is free to use, and open-source. There is a lot to be done, on both a theoretical and practical level, and anybody can get involved with developing the software. If you are interested, please get in touch with [Jamie Vicary](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/). _Globular_ has been developed in the [Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/) of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), by [Krzysztof Bar](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/krzysztof.bar/), [Aleks Kissinger](http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.Kissinger/), [Jamie Vicary](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/) and [Caspar Wylie]().

## How it works ##

Using _Globular_ involves two main techniques: building the _signature_, and building a _diagram_ over the signature. The signature is the list of cells that are available, and the diagram is a particular composite of those cells. A diagram can be thought of as a morphism in the free semistrict $\infty$-category generated by the signature.

The signature can be enlarged by building diagrams $S$ and $T$, and assigning them to be the source and target of a new cell. Any pair of diagrams can be chosen which satisfy the [[globular set|globularity conditions]] $s(S) = t(S)$ and $s(T) = t(T)$. The new cell can then be given a name and a colour, to make it easy to identify. Diagrams are built by clicking on cells of the signature, and by clicking and dragging on the diagram itself.

If you create an account on the site, you can save projects to your private workspace. You can also share projects privately with other users, and publish them publicly and irrevocably, creating a permanent archive of a proof that can be linked to from another page, or from a research paper.

## Manipulating diagrams ##

A diagram is a composite of the cells in the current signature, and basic diagram manipulation can be performed by clicking on the signature, as follows, where we suppose our diagram $D$ is $k$-dimensional. 

* **Creation.** If the current diagram is empty, clicking the icon of a cell in the signature constructs a diagram which consists solely of the selected generator.
* **Rewriting.** Selecting a $(k+1)$-cell $G$ from the signature displays a list of all the ways that its source $s(G)$ can be identified as a subdiagram of $D$. Choosing element of this list will then modify $D$, deleting the part of it which was chosen as matching the source $s(G)$, and replacing it with the target $t(G)$.
* **Attaching.** Selecting a $p$-cell $G$ for $p \leq k$ displays a list of all the ways that $G$ can be attached to $D$ along one of its boundaries. Choosing an element of this list performs the attachment.

The menu on the right-hand side of the screen gives further commands. Each of these commands has a shortcut key, which is bracketed.

* **(C)lear.** (Shortcut key 'c'.) Deletes the current diagram.
* **(I)dentity.** Builds the identity $(k+1)$-diagram on the current $k$-diagram.
* **(S)ource.** Stores the current diagram as the source of a new generator.
* **(T)arget.** Stores the current diagram as the target of a new generator.
* **(R)estrict.** Replaces the current diagram with the subdiagram currently being viewed (see Section XX.)
* **T(h)eorem.** Creates a new theorem witnessing the current diagram (see Section XX .)

Also, the user can click and click-and-drag on the diagram to produce various effects. When a command is ambiguous, a menu will be presented to allow the user to choose their preferred action.

* **Click.** This attempts to attach or rewrite, as appropriate for the location of the click, with an element of the signature. If an element of the signature is marked as invertible, then the higher structure this implies will also be considered for attachment.
* **Click-and-drag.** This attempts to attach or rewrite using an interchanger, or naturality for the interchanger, or invertibility of some cell. This is sensitive to both the click location and the direction of the drag, in a way which should be intuitive.

## Changing the view ##

_Globular_ can currently present string-diagram visualizations of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional diagrams. Viewing a $k$-dimensional diagram for $k \gt 2$ therefore requires use of _projection_ or _slicing_, controlled by number scrollers which appear in the top-right of a diagram.

A projection value of $p$ will cause the lowest $p$ dimensions of the diagram to be ignored by the visualization; for example, a 1-projection of a 3-dimensional diagram results in 2-dimensional picture. This is a singularity graphic in the sense of higher Morse theory.

Suppose you choose to project out $p$ dimensions, such that $k-p \gt 2$. Then _Globular_ cannot display the entire projected diagram at once, and the user is required to choose a total of $k-p-2$ slice coordinates, to indicate the 2-dimensional subdiagram to be displayed. Scrolling through the values of these coordinates allows the user to move through the proof in a systematic way.

## Invertibility

A $k$-cell $f:A \to B$ in an $\infty$-category is _invertible_ when there is an inverse cell $f ^{-1} : B \to A$, and invertible $(k+1)$-cells $\mu: \mathrm{id}_A \to f ^{-1} \circ f$ and $\nu: \mathrm{id}_B \to f \circ f ^{-1}$. This is a co-inductive definition, giving rise to an infinite amount of higher-dimensional structure.

In _Globular_, selecting the 'Invertible' option for a cell in the signature allows this higher structure to be used in diagrams, by clicking at a point of a diagram or its boundary. If more than one piece of higher invertible structure could be inserted at the location of the click, a menu is presented and the user can choose which is intended.

## Theorems

The **Theorem** command allows a diagram to be stored, in a way that lets it be reused as a component in subsequent diagrams. The idea is that the diagram is a 'theorem' proving that its source can be rewritten into its target. The proof is the diagram itself.

More concretely, let $D$ be the current diagram, which is $k$-dimensional, and let $s(D)$ and $t(D)$ be its source and target $(k-1)$-diagrams. Then the theorem command command creates two new generators:

 * A $k$-generator $T$ with source $s(D)$ and target $t(D)$
 * An invertible $(k+1)$-generator $P$ with source $T$ and with target $D$

The generator $T$ can be used in future proofs to 'stand in' for the diagram $D$. At any point, the generator $P$ can be used to replace $T$ with the content of diagram $D$. Since $P$ is invertible, it could also be used to identify $D$ as a subdiagram of a larger proof, and replace it with $T$, making the larger proof easier to understand.
