## Introduction ##

_Globular_ is a web-based [[proof assistant]] for [[semistrict]] [[globular set|globular]] [[higher categories]]. It allows one to formalize higher-categorical proofs in finitely-presented [[n-categories]], visualize them as [[string diagrams]], and share them with collaborators, or with the world.

It currently operates up to the level 3-categories. By the yoga of [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]], this also allows one to construct proofs in monoidal 2-categories and braided monoidal 1-categories. An extension to 4-categories is actively in development.

The model of [[semistrict]] higher categories that _Globular_ uses puts all the weak structures in the interchangers, and higher associated structures. For [[3-categories]], this means that _Globular_ implements the axioms of a [[Gray category]].

_Globular_ is free to use, and open-source. There is a lot to be done, on both a theoretical and practical level, and anybody can get involved with developing the software. If you are interested, please get in touch with [Jamie Vicary](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/). _Globular_ has been developed in the [Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/) of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), by [Krzysztof Bar](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/krzysztof.bar/), [Aleks Kissinger](http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.Kissinger/), [Jamie Vicary](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/) and [Caspar Wylie]().

## How it works ##

Using _Globular_ involves two main techniques: building the _signature_, and building a _diagram_ over the signature. The signature is the list of cells that are available, and the diagram is a particular composite of those cells. A diagram can be thought of as a morphism in the free semistrict $\infty$-category generated by the signature.

The signature can be enlarged by building diagrams $S$ and $T$, and assigning them to be the source and target of a new cell. Any pair of diagrams can be chosen which satisfy the [[globular set|globularity conditions]] $s(S) = t(S)$ and $s(T) = t(T)$. The new cell can then be given a name and a colour, to make it easy to identify. Diagrams are built by clicking on cells of the signature, and by clicking and dragging on the diagram itself.

If you create an account on the site, you can save projects to your private workspace. You can also share projects privately with other users, and publish them publicly and irrevocably, creating a permanent archive of a proof that can be linked to from another page, or from a research paper.

## Manipulating diagrams ##

A diagram is a composite of the cells in the current signature. A $k$-dimensional diagram $D$ can be manipulated in the following basic ways.

* **Creation.** If the current diagram is empty, clicking the icon of a $k$-cell in the signature constructs a $k$-dimensional diagram which consists solely of the selected generator.
* **Destruction.** Clicking 'clear' (shortcut key 'c') deletes the current diagram.
* **Rewriting.** Selecting a $(k+1)$-cell $G$ from the signature gives a list of all the ways that its source $s(G)$ can be identified as a subdiagram of $D$. Choosing element of this list will then modify $D$, deleting the part of it which was chosen as matching the source $s(G)$, and replacing it with the target $t(G)$.
* **Attaching.** Selecting a $p$-cell $G$ for $p \leq k$ displays a list of all the ways that $G$ can be attached to $D$ along one of its boundaries. Choosing an element of this list performs the attachment.
* **Clicking and dragging.** Using the mouse to click or drag a part the diagram or its boundary will attempt to attach or rewrite using an interchanger, or naturality for the interchanger, or invertibility of some cell. This is sensitive to the part of the diagram that is clicked, and the direction of the drag, in a way which should be intuitive. When multiple attachments or rewrites are consistent with the mouse command, a menu appears to allow the user to choose the one which is intended.
* **Identity.** Clicking 'identity' (shortcut key 'i') takes the identity on the current diagram, boosting its dimension by 1.
* **Assigning source and target.** Clicking 'source' or 'target' (shortcut keys 's' and 't') selects the current diagram as the source or target of a new $(k+1)$-cell, which will be inserted into the signature once both the source and target have been defined.

## Changing the view ##

_Globular_ can currently present string-diagram visualizations of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional diagrams. Viewing a $k$-dimensional diagram for $k \gt 2$ therefore requires use of _projection_ or _slicing_, controlled by number scrollers which appear in the top-right of a diagram.

A projection value of $p$ will cause the lowest $p$ dimensions of the diagram to be ignored by the visualization; for example, a 1-projection of a 3-dimensional diagram results in 2-dimensional picture. This is a singularity graphic in the sense of higher Morse theory.

Suppose you choose to project out $p$ dimensions, such that $k-p \gt 2$. Then _Globular_ cannot display the entire projected diagram at once, and the user is required to choose a total of $k-p-2$ slice coordinates, to indicate the 2-dimensional subdiagram to be displayed. Scrolling through the values of these coordinates allows the user to move through the proof in a systematic way.

## Invertibility

A $k$-cell $f:A \to B$ in an $\infty$-category is _invertible_ when there is an inverse cell $f ^{-1} : B \to A$, and invertible $(k+1)$-cells $\mu: \mathrm{id}_A \to f ^{-1} \circ f$ and $\nu: \mathrm{id}_B \to f \circ f ^{-1}$. This is a co-inductive definition, giving rise to an infinite amount of higher-dimensional structure.

In _Globular_, selecting the 'Invertible' option for a cell in the signature allows this higher structure to be used in diagrams, by clicking at a point of a diagram or its boundary. If more than one piece of higher invertible structure could be inserted at the location of the click, a menu is presented and the user can choose which is intended.
