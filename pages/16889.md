## Introduction ##

_Globular_ is a web-based [[proof assistant]] for [[semistrict]] [[higher categories]]. It allows one to formalize higher-categorical proofs in finitely-presented [[n-categories]], visualize them as [[string diagrams]], and share them with collaborators, or with the world. It currently operates up to the level 3-categories, with 4-categories actively in development.

The model of [[semistrict]] higher categories that _Globular_ uses puts all the weak structures in the interchangers, and higher associated structures. For [[3-categories]], this means that _Globular_ implements the axioms of a [[Gray category]].

_Globular_ is free to use, and open-source. There is a lot to be done, on both a theoretical and practical level, and anybody can get involved with developing the software. _Information about the Git repository and mailing list._

## How it works ##

Using _Globular_ involves two main techniques: building the _signature_, and building a _diagram_ over the current signature. The signature is the list of $k$-cells you have available, and the diagram is a particular composite of those cells.

The signature is a list of cells. Each cell has a dimension $k$, and is defined by two pieces of data, a source $S$ and a target $T$, which must be $(k-1)$-diagrams. These must satisfy the [[globular set|globularity conditions]], which state that the source of $S$ equals the source of $T$, and the target of $S$ equals the target of $T$.

Given a particular signature, a diagram can be constructed. By clicking the icon of $k$-cell in the signature, a $k$-diagram is drawn in the main part of the screen, which consists solely of the selected generator. The $k$-diagram $D$ can then be manipulated several different ways.

* **Rewriting.** Selecting a $(k+1)$-cell $G$ from the signature gives a list of all the ways that the source of $G$ can be identified as a subdiagram of $D$. Choosing element of this list will then modify $D$, deleting the part of it which was the source of $G$, and replacing this part with the target of $G$.
* **Attaching.** Selecting a $p$-cell $G$ for $p \leq k$ displays a list of all the ways that $G$ can be attached to $D$ along one of its boundaries. Choosing an element of this list performs the attachment.
* **Interchanging**.
* **Projecting and slicing.**
