## Introduction ##

_Globular_ is a web-based [[proof assistant]] for [[semistrict]] [[globular set|globular]] [[higher categories]]. It allows one to formalize higher-categorical proofs in finitely-presented [[n-categories]], visualize them as [[string diagrams]], and share them with collaborators, or with the world.

It currently operates up to the level 3-categories. By the yoga of [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]], this also allows one to construct proofs in monoidal 2-categories and braided monoidal 1-categories. An extension to 4-categories is actively in development.

The model of [[semistrict]] higher categories that _Globular_ uses puts all the weak structures in the interchangers, and higher associated structures. For [[3-categories]], this means that _Globular_ implements the axioms of a [[Gray category]].

_Globular_ is free to use, and open-source. There is a lot to be done, on both a theoretical and practical level, and anybody can get involved with developing the software. If you are interested, please get in touch with [Jamie Vicary](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/). _Globular_ has been developed in the [Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/) of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), by [Krzysztof Bar](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/krzysztof.bar/), [Aleks Kissinger](http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.Kissinger/), [Jamie Vicary](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/) and [Caspar Wylie]().

## Basic functionality

#### Overview

Using _Globular_ involves two main techniques: building the _signature_, and building a _diagram_ over the signature. The signature is the list of cells that are available, and the diagram is a particular composite of those cells. A diagram can be thought of as a morphism in the free semistrict $\infty$-category generated by the signature.

The signature can be enlarged by building diagrams $S$ and $T$, and assigning them to be the source and target of a new cell. Any pair of diagrams can be chosen which satisfy the [[globular set|globularity conditions]] $s(S) = t(S)$ and $s(T) = t(T)$. The new cell can then be given a name and a colour, to make it easy to identify. Diagrams are built by clicking on cells of the signature, and by clicking and dragging on the diagram itself.

If you create an account on the site, you can save projects to your private workspace. You can also share projects privately with other users, and publish them publicly and irrevocably, creating a permanent archive of a proof that can be linked to from another page, or from a research paper.

#### Manipulating diagrams

A diagram is a composite of the cells in the current signature, and basic diagram manipulation can be performed by clicking on the signature, as follows, where we suppose our diagram $D$ is $k$-dimensional. 

* **Creation.** If the current diagram is empty, clicking the icon of a cell in the signature constructs a diagram which consists solely of the selected generator.
* **Rewriting.** Selecting a $(k+1)$-cell $G$ from the signature displays a list of all the ways that its source $s(G)$ can be identified as a subdiagram of $D$. Choosing element of this list will then modify $D$, deleting the part of it which was chosen as matching the source $s(G)$, and replacing it with the target $t(G)$.
* **Attaching.** Selecting a $p$-cell $G$ for $p \leq k$ displays a list of all the ways that $G$ can be attached to $D$ along one of its boundaries. Choosing an element of this list performs the attachment.

The menu on the right-hand side of the screen gives further commands. Each of these commands has a shortcut key, which is also given.

* **Clear _c_.**  Deletes the current diagram.
* **Identity _i_.** Builds the identity $(k+1)$-diagram on the current $k$-diagram.
* **Source _s_.** Stores the current diagram as the source of a new generator.
* **Target _t_.** Stores the current diagram as the target of a new generator.
* **Restrict _r_.** Replaces the current diagram with the subdiagram currently being viewed (see [Changing the view](#changingtheview).)
* **Theorem _h_.** Creates a new theorem witnessing the current diagram (see [Invertibility](#invertibility).)

Also, the user can click and click-and-drag on the diagram to produce various effects. When a command is ambiguous, a menu will be presented to allow the user to choose their preferred action.

* **Click.** This attempts to attach or rewrite, as appropriate for the location of the click, with an element of the signature. If an element of the signature is marked as invertible, then the higher structure this implies will also be considered for attachment.
* **Click-and-drag.** This attempts to attach or rewrite using an interchanger, or naturality for the interchanger, or invertibility of some cell. This is sensitive to both the click location and the direction of the drag, in a way which should be intuitive. This also allows cells to be cancelled from the top or bottom of a diagram.

#### Changing the view {#changingtheview}

_Globular_ can currently present string-diagram visualizations of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional diagrams. Viewing a $k$-dimensional diagram for $k \gt 2$ is made possible by _projection_ and _slicing_, controlled by number scrollers which appear in the top-right of a diagram.

The first control is _View_, which can currently be set to 0, 1 or 2; we suppose this has value $v$. This determines the dimension of the image which is rendered.

The second control is _Project_, which determines the number of dimensions to be projected; it can take any value $p$ in the range $0 \leq p \leq k$. Projecting a dimension causes it to be effectively ignored by _Globular_; it is as if you are looking at a shadow of the true image. The resulting diagrams are exactly the _singularity graphics_ which are a common tool in [[Morse theory|higher Morse theory]].

Having set view dimension $v$, and having decided to project out $p$ dimensions, that leaves $k - v - p$ dimensions of the diagram. If this sum is zero, there is nothing more to be specified. If it is positive, coordinates must be chosen to position the view within a subdiagram. These appear under the heading _Slice_ as a total of $k - v - p$ number inputs.

## Advanced features

#### Invertibility {#invertibility}

A $k$-cell $f:A \to B$ in an $\infty$-category is _invertible_ when there is an inverse cell $f ^{-1} : B \to A$, and invertible $(k+1)$-cells $\mu: \mathrm{id}_A \to f ^{-1} \circ f$ and $\nu: \mathrm{id}_B \to f \circ f ^{-1}$. This is a co-inductive definition, giving rise to an infinite amount of higher-dimensional structure.

In _Globular_, selecting the 'Invertible' option for a cell in the signature allows this higher structure to be used in diagrams, by clicking at a point of a diagram or its boundary. If more than one piece of higher invertible structure could be inserted at the location of the click, a menu is presented and the user can choose which is intended.

#### Theorems

The theorem command allows a diagram to be stored, in a such way that it can be reused as a component in subsequent diagrams. The idea is that the diagram is a 'theorem' proving that its source can be rewritten into its target. The 'proof' is the diagram itself.

Concretely, let $D$ be the current diagram, which is $k$-dimensional, and let $s(D)$ and $t(D)$ be its source and target $(k-1)$-diagrams. Then the theorem command command creates two new generators:

 * A $k$-generator $T$ with source $s(D)$ and target $t(D)$
 * An invertible $(k+1)$-generator $P$ with source $T$ and with target $D$

The generator $T$ can be used in future proofs to 'stand in' for the diagram $D$. At any point, the generator $P$ can be used to replace $T$ with the content of diagram $D$. Since $P$ is invertible, it could also be used to identify $D$ as a subdiagram of a larger proof, and replace it with $T$, making the larger proof easier to understand.
