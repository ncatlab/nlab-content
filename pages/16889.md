## Introduction ##

_Globular_ is a web-based [[proof assistant]] for [[semistrict]] [[higher categories]]. It allows one to formalize higher-categorical proofs in finitely-presented [[n-categories]], visualize them as [[string diagrams]], and share them with collaborators, or with the world. It currently operates up to the level 3-categories, with 4-categories actively in development.

The model of [[semistrict]] higher categories that _Globular_ uses puts all the weak structures in the interchangers, and higher associated structures. For [[3-categories]], this means that _Globular_ implements the axioms of a [[Gray category]].

_Globular_ is free to use, and open-source. There is a lot to be done, on both a theoretical and practical level, and anybody can get involved with developing the software. _Information about the Git repository and mailing list._

## How it works ##

Using _Globular_ involves two main techniques: building the _signature_, and building a _diagram_ over the current signature. The signature is the list of cells that are available, and the diagram is a particular composite of those cells. 

The signature can be enlarged by building two diagrams $S$ and $T$, and assigning them to be the source and target of a new cell. Any pair of diagrams can be chosen which satisfy the [[globular set|globularity conditions]] $s(S) = t(S)$ and $s(T) = t(T)$. The new cell can then be given a name and a colour, to make it easy to identify.

## Manipulating diagrams ##

A diagram is a composite of the cells in the current signature. A $k$-dimensional diagram $D$ can be manipulated in the following basic ways.

* **Creation.** If the current diagram is empty, clicking the icon of a $k$-cell in the signature constructs a $k$-dimensional diagram which consists solely of the selected generator.
* **Destruction.** Clicking 'clear' (shortcut key 'c') deletes the current diagram.
* **Rewriting.** Selecting a $(k+1)$-cell $G$ from the signature gives a list of all the ways that its source $s(G)$ can be identified as a subdiagram of $D$. Choosing element of this list will then modify $D$, deleting the part of it which was chosen as matching the source $s(G)$, and replacing it with the target $t(G)$.
* **Attaching.** Selecting a $p$-cell $G$ for $p \leq k$ displays a list of all the ways that $G$ can be attached to $D$ along one of its boundaries. Choosing an element of this list performs the attachment.
* **Interchanging.** Clicking and dragging some part of a diagram attempts to rewrite 
* **Projecting and slicing.**
