## Definition


In a [[2-category]] (and more generally in [[higher category theory]]) [[2-morphism]]s have a composition along the 1-morphisms that they go between.

$$
  \array{
     & \nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow
     \\
     x &&\to&& y
     \\
      & \searrow &\Downarrow& \nearrow
  }
  \,.
$$

This is in contrast to the other composition operation, along objects, which is called [[horizontal composition]].

## Examples

* In the 2-category [[Cat]], 2-morphisms are [[natural transformation]]s and vertical composition is the composition of these, the composition in the corresponding [[functor category]].

* For $A$ an [[abelian group]] and $\mathbf{B}^2 A$ its double [[delooping]] [[2-groupoid]], vertical composition (as well as horizontal composition) is given by the group product operation in $A$.
