## In general categorical setup

Given a [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$, a [[morphism]] $f: A\to B$ in a [[category]] $C$ is $\kappa$-pure if for every [[commutative square]]

$$\array{
P & \stackrel{g}\to & Q\\
u\downarrow && \downarrow v \\
A &\stackrel{f}\to & B
}$$

in which $P$ and $Q$ are $\kappa$-[[presentable objects]], the morphism $u:P\to A$
factors through $g$.  In other words, $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all morphisms between $\kappa$-presentable objects.

> Warning: it seems that in fact only the top triangle is required to commute. This needs to be checked. Discussion is [here](http://nforum.mathforge.org/discussion/4113/pure-subobject/?Focus=33566#Comment_33566).

In a $\kappa$-[[accessible category]] $C$ every $\kappa$-pure morphism is [[monic]]. In a locally $\kappa$-[[locally presentable category|presentable category]] $\kappa$-pure morphisms are, moreover, [[regular monomorphisms]], and in fact coincide with the $\kappa$-[[directed colimits]] of [[split monomorphism]]s in the category of arrows $C^2 = Arr(C)$; more generally this characterization holds in all $\kappa$-accessible categories admiting [[pushouts]] (Adámek, Hub, Tholen).  


## In ring theory and for schemes

We work with unital, possibly commutative, [[rings]] and [[modules]].
Given a ring $R$, a morphism $f: M\to M'$ of left $R$-modules is pure if the tensoring the [[exact sequence]] of left $R$-modules

$$
0\to Ker f \to M\stackrel{f}\to M'\to Coker f\to 0
$$

with any right $R$-module $N$ (from the left) yields an exact sequence of abelian groups. 

Grothendieck has proved that faithfully flat morphisms of commutative schemes are of effective descent for the categories of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}$-modules. But this was not entirely optimal, as there is in fact a more general class than faithfully flat morphisms which satisfy the effective descent. For a local case of commutative rings, [[Joyal]] and Tierney have then proved (unpublished) that the [[effective descent morphisms]] for modules are precisely the pure morphisms of rings (or dually of affine schemes). Janelidze and Tholen have reproved the theorem as a corollary of a result for noncommutative rings obtained using the Beck's [[comonadicity theorem]].
