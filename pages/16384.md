## Statement

The only Euclidean [[composition algebras]] / [[division algebra|division]] [[composition algebras]] over the [[real numbers]] (i.e. real [[normed division algebras]]) are, up to [[isomorphism]], the algebras of

1. [[real numbers]]

1. [[complex numbers]]

1. [[quaternions]]

1. [[octonions]].

## Implications


### Real spinor representations and supersymmetry

This classification turns out to closely connect to various other systems of exceptional structures in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. Notably patterns related to [[Majorana spinors]] in [[spin geometry]] are intimately related to the four normed division algebras, and, induced by this, so is the classification of [[super Poincaré Lie algebras]] and [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] (which are built from these real spin representations). For more on this see at _[[supersymmetry and division algebras]]_.

### Hopf invariant one maps

The classification matches that of [[Hopf invariant one]] maps. See there for more.
