## Idea ##

An _irreducible representation_ --  often abbreviated _irrep_ -- is a [[representation]] that has no smaller non-trivial representations "sitting inside it".

Similarly for irreducible [[modules]].

## Definition ##

Given some algebraic structure, such as a [[group]], equipped with a notion of ([[linear representation|linear]]) [[representation]], an _irreducible representation_ is a [[representation]] that has no nontrivial proper [[subobject]] in the [[category of representations|category of all representations]] in question and yet which is not itself trivial either.  In other words, an irrep is a [[simple object]] in the [[category of representations]].

Notice that there is also the closely related but in general different notion of an [[indecomposable representation]].  Every irrep is indecomposable, but the converse may fail.

A representation that has proper nontrivial subrepresentations but can not be decomposed into a [[direct sum]] of such representations is an **indecomposable representation** but still reducible.

In good cases for [[finite dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]] representations, the two notions (irreducible, indecomposable) coincide.

###### Example
**([[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real numbers|real]] [[linear representations]] of [[cyclic groups]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 2$,
the [[isomorphism classes]] of [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real numbers|real]] [[linear representations]] of the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/n$ are given by precisely the following:

1. the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[trivial representation]] $\mathbf{1}$;

1. the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[sign representation]] $\mathbf{1}_{sgn}$;

1. the 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] standard representations $\mathbf{2}_k$ of [[rotations]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] by [[angles]] that are [[integer]] multiples of $2 \pi k/n$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $0 \lt k \lt n/2$;

   hence the [[restricted representations]] of the defining real rep of [[SO(2)]] under the [[subgroup]] inclusions $\mathbb{Z}/n \hookrightarrow SO(2)$, hence the representations generated by [[real number|real]] $2 \times 2$ [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]] [[matrices]] of the form

   $$
    \rho_{\mathbf{2}_k}(1)
    \;=\;
     \left(
       \array{
         cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta)
         \\
         sin(\theta) & \phantom{-}cos(\theta)
       }
     \right)
     \phantom{AA}
     \text{with}
     \;
     \theta = 2 \pi \tfrac{k}{n}
     \,,
   $$ 

  (For $k = n/2$ the corresponding 2d representation is the [[direct sum]] of two copies of the [[sign representation]]: $\mathbf{2}_{n/2} \simeq \mathbf{1}_{sgn} \oplus \mathbf{1}_{sgn}$, and hence not [[irrep|irreducible]]. Moreover, for $k \gt n/2$ we have that $\mathbf{2}_{k}$ is irreducible, but [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbf{2}_{n-k} \simeq \mathbf{2}_{-k}$).

In summary:

$$
  Rep^{irr}_{\mathbb{R}}
  \big(
    \mathbb{Z}/n  
  \big)_{/\sim}
  \;=\;
  \big\{
    \mathbf{1},
    \mathbf{1}_{sgn},
    \mathbf{2}_k
    \;\vert\;
    0 \lt k \lt n/2
  \big\}
$$
