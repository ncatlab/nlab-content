
#Idea#

An _irreducible representation_ --  often abbreviated _irrep_ -- is a [[representation]] that has no smaller non-trivial representations "sitting iside it".

#Definition#

An _irreducible representation_ is a [[representation]] that has no nontrivial [[subobject]] in the [[category]] of all representations in question.  In other words, an irrep is a [[simple object]] in the category of representation.


#Remarks#

There is also the closely related but in general different notion of an [[indecomposable representation]]. 

A representations that has proper subrepresentations but can not be decomposed into a [[direct sum]] of smaller nontrivial representations is reducible, but not decomposable.
