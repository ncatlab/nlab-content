Earlier sentence: An _irreducible representation_ -- often abbreviated as _irrep_ -- is a [[representation]] that "cannot be decomposed".

Zoran: Not true, this is called indecomposable representation. Not every indecomposable is irreducible in general. They coincide for compact groups. In general there are representations which have proper subrepresentations but can not be decomposed into direct sum of smaller representations.

Irreducible representation is the one corresponding to the simple object in the category of modules: in other words it does not have a nontrivial subrepresentation.
