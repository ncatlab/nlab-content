## Idea
 {#Idea}

In analogy to [[rational homotopy theory]], the idea of *real homotopy theory* is to study those aspects of [[homotopy types]] that are visible when the [[ground ring]] is the [[real numbers]], such as their [[real cohomology]]-[[cohomology groups|groups]] and the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product]] of their [[homotopy groups]] with the additive [[abelian group]] of [[real numbers]]. This is of central relevance in relation to [[differential cohomology theory]], which needs real instead of rational [[coefficients]] in order to connect to [[de Rham complexes]] of [[differential forms]] on [[smooth manifolds]].
 
But a technical issue with generalizing the [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]] to the case of real homotopy theory is that the 
[[PL de Rham complex|PL de Rham]]-[[Quillen adjunction between simplicial sets and connective dgc-algebras]] -- which does exist over any [[ground field]] $k$ of [[characteristic zero]] and relates to the one over the [[rational numbers]] by [[derived functor|derived]] [[extension of scalars]] (all reviewed in [FSS 2020, Sec. 3.2](#FSS20)) -- models $k$-[[localization]] only for $k = \mathbb{Q}$ the [[rational numbers]] -- then: [[rationalization]]. 

From the point of [[algebra]], the issue is (see [this Remark](core+of+a+ring#NoOtherCharZeroFieldIsSolid)) that other $k$ are not [[solid rings]], so that the iterations of the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor products]] $(-) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} k$ on [[homotopy groups]] are not, in general, [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to each other, for $k \neq \mathbb{Q}$.

On the other hand, from the point of [[topology]] the issue is that the [[real numbers]] $k = \mathbb{R}$ are naturally a [[topological ring]], whose topology, however, is ignored in the standard [[Quillen adjunction between simplicial sets and connective dgc-algebras]] over the real numbers.

Therefore, the *real homotopy theory* of [Brown & Szczarba 1995](#BrownSzczarba95) replaces, in the [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]], the plain [[real cohomology]]-groups by real [[continuous cohomology]] and plain [[dgc-algebras]] with [[topological ring|topological algebras]].


> The authors of ([Brown-Szczarba 95](#BrownSzczarba95)) show how the Bousfield-Gugenheim approach to [[rational homotopy theory]] may be extended to the framework of [[continuous cohomology]]. In the usual theory, the extension from the [[rational numbers|rationals]] to the [[real numbers|reals]] has always been effected by a formal tensoring with the reals. While this allows a connection to [[de Rham complex|de Rham theory]], it has always been preferable to have a direct construction of real homotopy theory akin to the [[Postnikov tower]]-like construction of [[rational homotopy theory]]. Unfortunately, in the usual situation, such a construction is impossible due to the incompatibility of the algebra of $\mathbb{R}$ (as an [[abelian group]]) with its natural [[topology]]. The authors of ([Brown-Szczarba 95](#BrownSzczarba95)) remedy this problem by creating a theory of [[minimal models]] which incorporates the usual topology of the reals and a generalization of [[van Est's theorem]] saying that $H^*(K(\mathbb{R},n); \mathbb{R})$ is a freely generated algebra on one generator (a result which is not true in the discrete topology case). By using the natural topology of $\mathbb{R}$, there is an immediate connection to [[continuous cohomology]] and applications such as [[characteristic classes]] of [[foliations]].

{#RelationToSchematicHomotopyType} If one thinks of [[simplicial topological spaces]] as [[simplicial presheaves]] on (some [[small category|small]] version of) [[Top]], and [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves|hence]] as presentations for [[topological infinity-stack|topological $\infty$-stacks]], then localization of these at the topological real line coefficient is the topological analog of passing to *[[schematic homotopy types]]*, in the sense of [Toën 2006](schematic+homotopy+type#Toen06), which generalizes to [[D-topological infinity-groupoid|D-topological $\infty$-groupoids]] (and further to [[smooth infinity-groupoids|smooth $\infty$-groupoids]] etc.) along the lines of [Stel 2010](function+algebras+on+infinity-stacks#Stel).
