## Definition

Given a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[bundle]] $E \to \Sigma$, then a [[differential form]] on its [[jet bundle]] $Jet(E)$ is called a _source form_ if it is of vertical degree 1 (with respect to the [[variational bicomplex]]) and its evaluation on a [[vector field]] depends only on the projection of that vector field to a vector field on $E$ itself (e.g. [Zuckerman 87, p. 6](#Zuckerman87)).

## In variational calculus

Given a [[local Lagrangian]] $\mathbf{L}$, i.e. a horizontal form on $Jet(E)$ of maximal horizontal degree, then there is a unique source form $\mathbf{E}$ such that 

$$
  d \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{E} - d_H \theta
$$

for some form $\theta$. This $\mathbf{E}$ is the [[Euler-Lagrange form]] of $\mathbf{L}$. 

The sum

$$
  \rho \coloneqq \mathbf{L} + \theta
$$

is the corresponding [[Lepage form]].
