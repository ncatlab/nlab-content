Matrix models are physical models in which the dynamic quantities are square matrices (in certain class of matrices, e.g. hermitian), in other words, a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian depends on matrix quantities and is usually taken at the limit when the size of matrix tends to infinity. 

Matrix models can be studied in the context of statistical mechanics (see [[random matrix theory]]) or in quantum field theory.
