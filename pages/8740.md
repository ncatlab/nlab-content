In [[deformation quantization]] the commutative product $\cdot$ of the commutative algebra of functions is replaced by a noncommutative associative product $\star$ which is formal power series whose first term is the commutative product. This one is called star product. Some people impose additional conditions for a noncommutative deformation of a commutative product to call it star product, for example to reproduce give Poisson bracket in classical limit of a commutator (in order Planck constant), some continuity conditions or sometimes to be given by a bidifferential operator. 

Some problems nowdays suggest also that considerations of nonassociative "star products" is of some use.
