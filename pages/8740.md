## Idea

In [[deformation quantization]] of [[Poisson manifolds]] the commutative product $\cdot$ of the [[commutative algebra|commutative]] [[algebra of functions]] is replaced by a noncommutative associative product. This is often called a **star product** and denoted "$\star$". 

An archetypical example is the _[[Moyal star product]]_ that deforms the function algebra on a Poisson vector space, and sometimes "star product" is by default understood to be a Moyal star product.

More recently also nonassociative "star products" have been proposed to be of interest.
