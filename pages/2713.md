## Idea


### Algebraically

A _spectral triple_ is algebraic data that mimics the geometric data provided by a [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ with [[spin structure]] and generalizes it to [[noncommutative geometry]]. It is effectively a [[Fredholm module]] refined by the specification of a [[dense subalgebra]] of the [[C-star-algebra]] of bounded operators on that module.

It consists of

1. a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$, to be thought of as the space of (square integrable) [[sections]] of the [[spinor bundle]] of $X$;

1. An [[associative algebra]] $A$ with a [[dense subalgebra|dense embedding]] $A \hookrightarrow B(H)$ into the [[C-star-algebra]] of [[bounded operators]] on $H$, to be thought of as the algebra of [[smooth function]]s on $X$;

   These two items encode the [[topology]] and [[smooth structure]].

1. A [[Fredholm operator]] $D$ acting on $\mathcal{H}$, to be thought of as the [[Dirac operator]] acing on the spinors.

   This item encodes the [[Riemannian metric]] and possibly a [[connection on a bundle|connection]].

Below we discuss how one may think  of a spectral triple as being precisely the algebraic data of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] defining the worldvolume [[QFT]] of the quantum [[relativistic particle|super particle]] propagating on a Riemannian target space (a [[sigma-model]].) Accordingly this is just the beginning of a pattern. One degree up a [[2-spectral triple]] is algebraic data encoding a Riemannian manifold with [[string structure]].

### As 1-dimensional FQFTs
 {#As1DimensionalFQFTs}

Here is an **unorthodox way** to state the idea of spectral triple in terms of [[FQFT]], which is in part just the reformulation of the [[quantum mechanics]] motivation that [[Alain Connes]] derived his definition from in the modern light of [[FQFT]], but which more concretely follows work by [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]]-[[Yan Soibelman|Soibelman]] and [[Yan Soibelman|Soibelman]] (linked to at [[2-spectral triple]]) which [[Urs Schreiber|methinks]] is the _right_ one. 

> (but maybe eventually we should have a traditional idea section and move this here to a subsection on further interpretations)

Let $R Cob_{1|1}^{Feyn}$ be the [[cobordism category]] of [[Feynman graph]]s for the [[superparticle]] with a single type of interaction along the lines of [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory]]. So its morphisms are generated from $(1|1)$-dimensional super-Riemannian manifolds (i.e. super-intervals) and from a single interaction vertex

$$
  \array{
    \bullet
    \\
    & \searrow
    \\
    && \bullet & \to
    \\
    & \nearrow
    \\
    \bullet
  }
$$

subject to the obvious associativity condition.

Then a spectral triple $(A,H,D)$ is the data encoding a sufficiently nice smooth [[functor]] 

$$
  Z_{(A,H,D)} : R Cob_{1|1}^{Feyn}  \to sVect
$$

to the [[category]] of [[super vector space]]s.

Here

* $A = Z_{(A,H,D)}(\bullet)_0$ is the even part of the [[super vector space]] assigned by the functor to the point, equipped with the structure of a [[algebra]] whose product is given by the image of the interaction vertex

  $$
    Z_{(A,H,D)}
    \left(
  \array{
    \bullet
    \\
    & \searrow
    \\
    && \bullet & \to
    \\
    & \nearrow
    \\
    \bullet
  }
    \right)
  $$

* $H$ is some completion of $Z_{(A,H,D)}(\bullet)$  to a [[super Hilbert space]]

* and $D \in End(H)$ is an odd self-adjoint operator on $H$, which gives the value of the functor on the super-interval $(t,\theta)$ by

  $$
    (t,\theta) \mapsto \exp( - t D^2 + \theta D )
    \,.
  $$ 

(For technical details that I am glossing over see the field theory link above).

So this is the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[superparticle]]. In the simplest case this comes from a spinor particle propagating on a [[spin structure]] [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$in which case

* $H = L^2(S)$ is the space of square integrable spinor sections;

* $D$ is the [[Dirac operator]]

* $A = C^\infty(X)$ is the space of smooth functions on $X$.

One point of a spectral triple is to take the view of world-line [[quantum mechanics]] as basic and _characterize_ the spin Riemannian geometry of $X$ entirely by this algebraic data. In particular the [[Riemannian metric]] on $X$ is encoded in the [[operator spectrum]] of $D$, which is where the notion "spectral triple" gets its name from.

Then with all the ordinary geoemtry re-encoded algebraically this way, in terms of the 1-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] that _probes_ this geometry, one can then use the same formulas to interpret spectral triple geometrically that do _not_ come from an ordinary geometry as in the above example.

## Properties


### Metric dimension and KO-dimension

For a space described by a spectral triple there are several notions of [[dimension]] which all coincide when the space is a classical [[smooth manifold]] but which may differ on more general spectral spaces.

Notably there is the [[metric dimension]], which determines the growth of the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[Dirac operator]] ([Connes95, p. 6](#Connes95)).

And then there is the [[KO-dimension]].
