## Idea

A _theta function_ ($\theta$-function) is a [[holomorphic section]] of a [[holomorphic line bundle]] over a [[complex torus]] / [[abelian variety]]. 

Expressed in local [[coordinates]] $\mathbb{C}^g$ it becomes an actual function, satisfying certain transformation properties. 

Theta functions are naturally thought of as being the [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|states]] in the [[geometric quantization]] of the given complex space, the given holomorphic line bundle being the [[prequantum line bundle]] and the condition of holomorphicity of the section being the [[polarization]] condition. See for instace ([Tyurin](#Tyurin)).
