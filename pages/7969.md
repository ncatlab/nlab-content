## Idea

### General

Generally, a _theta function_ ($\theta$-function, $\Theta$-function) is a [[holomorphic section]] of a ([[polarized variety|principally polarizing]]) [[holomorphic line bundle]] over a [[complex torus]] / [[abelian variety]].
(e.g. [Polishchuk 03, section 17](#Polishchuk03)) and in particular over a [[Jacobian variety]] ([Beauville](#Beauville)) such as [[prequantum line bundles]] for (abelian) [[gauge theory]]. The line bundle being principally polarizing means that its space of holomorphic sections is 1-dimensional, hence that it determines the $\theta$-function up to a global complex scale factor. Typically these line bundles themselves are [[Theta characteristics]].
Expressed in [[coordinates]] $\mathbf{z}$ on the [[covering]] $\mathbb{C}^g$ of the [[complex torus]] $\mathbb{C}^g/\mathbb{Z}^g$, a $\theta$-function appears as an actual function $\mathbf{z} \mapsto \theta(\mathbf{z})$ satisfying certain transformation properties, and this is how theta functions are considered.

Those theta functions encoding line bundles on a [[Jacobian variety]] $J(\Sigma)$ of a [[Riemann surface]] $\Sigma$ typically vary in a controlled way with the [[complex structure]] modulus $\mathbf{\tau}$ of $\Sigma$ and are hence really functions also of this variable $(\mathbf{z},\mathbf{\tau}) \mapsto \theta(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{\tau})$ with certain transformation properties. These are the _[[Riemann theta functions]]_. If here $\Sigma$ is complex 1-dimensional of [[genus]] $g = 1$ (hence a complex [[elliptic curve]]) then such a function $(z,\tau) \mapsto \theta(z,\tau)$ of two variables with the pertinent transformation properties is properly called a _[[Jacobi form]]_. Nevertheless the principal examples here are called _[[Jacobi theta functions]]_.

Specifically in the context of [[number theory]]/[[arithmetic geometry]], by _the_ theta function one usually means the _[[Jacobi theta function]]_ (see there for more) for $z = 0$. While this is the historically first and archetypical function from which all modern generalizations derive their name, notice that at fixed $z$ as a function in $\tau$ the "theta function" is not actually a section of a line bundle anymore.

Certain integrals of theta functions yield [[zeta functions]], see also at _[[function field analogy]]_.

### In quantization

Theta functions are naturally thought of as being the [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|states]] in the [[geometric quantization]] of the given complex space, the given holomorphic line bundle being the [[prequantum line bundle]] and the condition of holomorphicity of the section being the [[polarization]] condition. See for instance ([Tyurin 02](#Tyurin02)). In this context they play a proming role specifically in the quantization of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] and of [[self-dual higher gauge theory]]. See there for more.

Specifically the fact that in [[geometric quantization|geometric]] [[quantization of Chern-Simons theory]] in the abelian case, and the [[holographic principle|holographically]] dual [[partition functions]] of the [[WZW model]] the choice of polarization is induced from the choice of [[complex structure]] $\mathbf{\tau}$ on a given [[Riemann surface]] $\Sigma$ and for each such choice there is then a section/[[partition function]] depending on a coordinte $\mathbf{z}$ in the  [[Jacobian]] $J(\Sigma)$ is reflected in the double coordinate dependence of the theta function:

$$
  \theta(\mathbf{z},\mathbf{\tau})
  = 
  \theta\left(gauge\;field\;configuration\;on\;\Sigma\;, \; complex\;structure\;on\;\Sigma\right)
  \,.
$$

see e.g. ([AlvaresGaume-Moore-Vafa 86](#AlvaresGaumeMooreVafa86)).

Since from the point of view of [[Chern-Simons theory]] this is a [[wavefunction]], one might rather want to write $\Psi(\mathbf{z},\mathbf{\tau})$.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

Consider a [[complex torus]] $T \simeq V/\Gamma$ for given [[finite group]] $\Gamma$. 

Say that a _system of multipliers_ is a system of invertible [[holomorphic functions]] 

$$
  e_\gamma \colon V \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

satisfying the cocycle condition

$$
  e_{\gamma + \delta}(z) = e_\gamma(z + \delta) e_\delta(z)
  \,.
$$

Then a _theta function_ is a [[holomorphic function]]

$$
  \theta \colon V \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

for which there is a system of multipliers $\{e_\gamma\}$ satisfying the [[functional equation]] which says that for each $z \in V$ and $\gamma \in \Gamma \hookrightarrow V$ we have

$$
  \theta(z + \gamma) = e_\gamma(z) \theta(z)
  \,.
$$
