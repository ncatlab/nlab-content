## Idea

### General

Generally, a _theta function_ ($\theta$-function, $\Theta$-function) is a [[holomorphic section]] of a ([[polarized variety|principally polarizing]]) [[holomorphic line bundle]] over a [[complex torus]] / [[abelian variety]].
(e.g. [Polishchuk 03, section 17](#Polishchuk03)) and in particular over a [[Jacobian variety]] ([Beauville](#Beauville)) such as [[prequantum line bundles]] for (abelian) [[gauge theory]]. The line bundle being principally polarizing means that its space of holomorphic sections is 1-dimensional, hence that it determines the $\theta$-function up to a global complex scale factor. Typically these line bundles themselves are [[Theta characteristics]].
Expressed in local [[coordinates]] on $\mathbb{C}^g$ a $\theta$-function appears as an actual function, satisfying certain transformation properties. 

Specifically in the context of [[number theory]]/[[arithmetic geometry]], by _the_ theta function one usually means the _[[Jacobi theta function]]_ (see there for more), which is the historically first and archetypical function from which all modern generalizations derive their name.

Certain integrals of theta functions yield [[zeta functions]], see also at _[[function field analogy]]_.

### In quantization

Theta functions are naturally thought of as being the [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|states]] in the [[geometric quantization]] of the given complex space, the given holomorphic line bundle being the [[prequantum line bundle]] and the condition of holomorphicity of the section being the [[polarization]] condition. See for instance ([Tyurin 02](#Tyurin02)). In this context they play a proming role specifically in the quantization of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] and of [[self-dual higher gauge theory]]. See there for more.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

Consider a [[complex torus]] $T \simeq V/\Gamma$ for given [[finite group]] $\Gamma$. 

Say that a _system of multipliers_ is a system of invertible [[holomorphic functions]] 

$$
  e_\gamma \colon V \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

satisfying the cocycle condition

$$
  e_{\gamma + \delta}(z) = e_\gamma(z + \delta) e_\delta(z)
  \,.
$$

Then a _theta function_ is a [[holomorphic function]]

$$
  \theta \colon V \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

for which there is a system of multipliers $\{e_\gamma\}$ satisfying the [[functional equation]] which says that for each $z \in V$ and $\gamma \in \Gamma \hookrightarrow V$ we have

$$
  \theta(z + \gamma) = e_\gamma(z) \theta(z)
  \,.
$$
