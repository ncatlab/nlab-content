## Idea

What is called the _Langlands correspondence_ in [[number theory]] ([Langlands 67](#Langlands67)) is a [[conjecture|conjectural]] correspondence (a [[bijection]] subject to various conditions) between 

1. $n$-[[dimensional]] [[representations]] of the [[Galois group]] $Gal(\bar F/F)$ of a given [[number field]] $F$, and

1. certain [[representations]] -- called _[[automorphic representations]]_ -- of the $n$-dimensional [[general linear group]] $GL_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[ring of adeles]] of $F$, arising within the representations given by [[functions]] on the double [[coset space]] $GL_n(F) \backslash GL_n(\mathbb{A}_F)/GL_n(\mathcal{O})$ (where $\mathcal{O} = \prod_v \mathcal{O}_p$ is the [[ring of integers]] of all [[formal completions]] of $F$).

This conjecture is motivated from the following special case, which is fully understood:

For $n = 1$ then an $n$-dimensional representation of the [[Galois group]] factors through $GL_1$ and hence through an [[abelian group]]. Therefore, by [[adjunction]], it is equivalently a representation of the [[abelianization]] of the Galois group. The [[Kronecker-Weber theorem]] says that for $F = \mathbb{Q}$, then the abelianized Galois group is $GL_1(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash GL_1(\mathbb{A})$, and hence 1-dimensional representations of the Galois group are equivalently representations of this. Moreover, one finds that for any [[prime number]] $p$, then those representations which are "unramified at $p$" are invariant under the subring of [[p-adic integers]], hence are representations of the double quotient group $GL_1(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash GL_1(\mathbb{A})/GL_1(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. 

Various versions and refinements of this conjecture have since been considered, for some perspective see ([Langlands 14](#Langlands14)).

In particular, interpretation of the above story dually in [[arithmetic geometry]] has led to some developments. Namely under the [[function field analogy]] we have that 

* the [[Galois group]] is essentially the [[fundamental group]] of an [[algebraic curve]];

* hence a [[representation]] of it is a [[principal bundle|principal]]/[[vector bundle]] with [[flat connection]] on this curves;

* while that curious double quotient $GL_n(F) \backslash GL_n(\mathbb{A}_F)/GL_n(\mathcal{O}_F)$ is just the canonical [[Cech cohomology|Cech]]-realization of the [[moduli stack of bundles]] (see there for details) on that curve.

From this [[arithmetic geometry]] point of view the Langlands conjecture seems to speak of a correspondence that sends [[Dirac distributions]] on the [[moduli space of flat connections]] over an [[algebraic curve]] to certain "automorphic" functions on the [[moduli stack of bundles]] on the same curve. This suggests that the Langlands correspondence should be understood as a nonabelian version of a [[Fourier-Mukai transform|Fourier-Mukai]]-type [[integral transform]]. This version of the conjecture is known as the _[[geometric Langlands correspondence]]_. See there for more details.
