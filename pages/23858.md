## Idea ##

A [[mathematical structure]] used to define the [[real numbers]] in [[Alfred Tarski]]'s axioms for the [[real numbers]]. 

## Definition ##

A [[Tarski group]] is a [[pointed set|pointed]] [[commutative invertible semigroup]] $(G, +, -, 1)$ with a [[dense linear order]] $\lt$ such that $1 \lt 1 + 1$ and for all $a, b, c, d \in G$, $a + b \lt c + d$ implies that $a \lt c$ or $b \lt d$. 

As a result, every Tarski group is an [[abelian group]] with [[identity element]] $0 \coloneqq 1 - 1$, and a [[trivial group|nontrivial]] [[archimedean group]].

### In Tarski's axioms for the real numbers ###

* Axiom 5 says that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[commutative semigroup]]. 

* Axiom 6 with axiom 5 together say that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[commutative invertible semigroup]]. 

* Axiom 8 says that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[pointed set]], which with axioms 5 and 6 imply that $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[abelian group]]. 

* Axiom 1 says that $\mathbb{R}$ has a [[connected relation]] $\lt$. 

* Axiom 2 says that $\lt$ is an [[asymmetric relation]] and thus an [[irreflexive relation]]. 

* Axiom 4 implies that $\lt$ is a [[comparison]], making $\lt$ into a [[linear order]]. 

* Axiom 3 says that $\lt$ is a [[dense linear order]].

* Axiom 7 says that for all $a, b, c, d \in G$, $a + b \lt c + d$ implies that $a \lt c$ or $b \lt d$, which imply that $\mathbb{R}$ is a linearly [[ordered group]] and an [[archimedean group]]. 

* Axiom 9 says that $1 \lt 1 + 1$, which indicates that $\mathbb{R}$ is not [[trivial group|trivial]].
