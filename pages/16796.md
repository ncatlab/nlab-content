## Idea

Given a [[jet bundle]] $J^r E$ of jets of finite order $r \in \mathbb{Z}$, its _variational sequence_ ([Krupka 90](#Krupka90)) is a [[resolution]] of its [[constant sheaf]] of [[locally constant functions]] with values in the [[real numbers]] by a [[chain complex]] of quotient of sheaves of [[differential forms]] by combinations of [[contact forms]] and their [[de Rham differentials]]. (e.g. [PRWM 15, section 2.2](#PRWM15)).

The variational sequence is a sub-sequence of the [[Euler complex]] as obtained from the theory of the [[variational bicomplex]] ([Krupka 90](#Krupka90), see e.g. [PRWM 15,theorem 1](#PRWM15)).
