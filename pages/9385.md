## Idea

The generalization of the notion of [[flat connection]] from [[differential geometry]] to [[higher differential geometry]] and generally to [[higher geometry]].

## Definition

Given a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $(\Pi \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ with [[shape modality]] $\Pi$ and [[flat modality]] $\flat$, a **flat $\infty$-connection** an an [[object]] $X$ with [[coefficients]] in an object $A$ is a morphism

$$
  \nabla \;\colon\; X \to \flat A
$$

or equivalently a morphism

$$
  \nabla \;\colon\; \Pi(X) \to A
  \,.
$$

This is also sometimes called a _[[local system]]_ on $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$, or a _[[cocycle]]_ in [[nonabelian cohomology]] of $X$ with _constant_ [[coefficients]] $A$.

For $A = \mathbf{B}G$ the [[delooping]] of an [[∞-group]], flat $\infty$-connections with coefficients in $A$ are a special case of $G$-[[principal ∞-connections]].
