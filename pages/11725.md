## Idea

In the context of [[algebraic geometry]] over the [[complex numbers]], and hence (by [[GAGA]]) in the context of [[complex analytic geometry]], the term "exponential exact sequence" typically referes to the [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to ker(\exp) \longrightarrow \mathbb{G}_{a} \stackrel{\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}(-))}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{G}_m \to 0
$$

given by the [[exponential map]] $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}(-))$ from the [[additive group]] to the [[multiplicative group]]. Here $\hbar$ is any element of $\mathbb{R}^\times$ ("[[Planck's constant]]") but is traditionally set either to $1$ or to $1/2 \pi$. 

Hence more explicitly over the [[complex numbers]] this is 

$$
  0 \to \hbar2\pi\mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C} \stackrel{\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}(-))}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{C}^\times \to 0
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{C}$ denotes the complex numbers as the additive [[abelian group]] and where $\mathbb{C}^\times = \mathbb{C} - \{0\}$ is the [[group of units]] of the [[ring]] structure of the complex numbers.

Often this is considered and displayed [[slice topos|relative]] to a $\mathbb{C}$-[[scheme]] and/or [[complex analytic space]] $X$, where in terms of the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ it reads

$$
  0 \to Lconst(\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \stackrel{\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}(-))}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{O}_X^\times \to 0
  \,.
$$

In this form the sequence is then also called the _exponential sheaf sequence_.
