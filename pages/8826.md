[[!redirects knowledge in a multiagent system]]
To quote from a book on the subject:

''Multiagent systems are a new paradigm for understanding and building distributed systems, where it is assumed that the computational components are autonomous: able to control their own behaviour in the furtherance of their own goals.''


The area is a very wide one and this entry only deals with the question of 'knowledge' in multiagent systems and the models of that that involve the use of [[modal logic]].
