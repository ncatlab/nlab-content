## Idea

The [[super Yang-Mills theory]] in [[dimension]] 4 with the 
maximum number $N = 4$ of [[supersymmetries]].

## Properties of 4d SYM

### Conformal invariance

$N=4$ $D=4$ SYM is an [[SCFT]].

### Closed expressions for physical observables
 {#ClosedExpressionsForPhysicalObservables}

Among all [[gauge theory]] [[Lagrangians]] that of $N=4$, $D = 4$ SYM is special in several ways, in particular of course in that it is conformally invariant and in that it has maximal [[supersymmetry]]; and ultimately by the fact that it is the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] of the very special [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] and related by [[AdS-CFT|AdS7-CFT6 duality]] to the very special theory of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]].

Accordingly, it is to be expected that the [[quantum observables]] of $N=4$, $D = 4$ SYM satisfy special relations that make them more tractable than the observables of a generic [[gauge theory]], in particular by having closed-form expressions.
Indeed, such relations have been and are being uncovered in the last years, in particular in what is called the _[[planar limit]]_ of the theory, where [[scattering amplitudes]] are dominated by [[Feynman diagrams]] that can be given the structure of planar [[graphs]].

This includes notably the following phenomena:

1. The [[operator spectrum]] of the dilatation operator (the part of the [[stress-energy tensor]] which induces conformal transformations) can be expressed in closed form, indeed when regarded as a [[Hamiltonian]] it defines an [[integrable system]] equivalent to [[spin chain]] models. This has been used in particular to explicitly check aspects of the conjectured [[AdS-CFT duality]] of $N=4$, $D= 4$ SYM with [[type II string theory]] on [[anti de Sitter spacetimes]]. See the review ([Beisert et al](#Beisert)).

1. Certain [[scattering amplitudes]] called _maximally helicity violating amplitudes_ ("[[MHV amplitudes]]") simplify drastically as compared to the generic situation and in fact are controled by a certain [[twistor string theory]] whose [[target space]] is a [[twistor space]]. See ([Monteiro](#Monteiro)) for a review.

1. Generally, the [[scattering amplitudes]] of the theory in the planar limit have certain closed-form combinatorial expressions. See ([Arkani-Hamed et al](#Arkani-Hamed)).

Such "exact solutions" of the theory are of interest in that even though N=4, D=4 SYM is very different from [[phenomenology|phenomenologically viable]] models such that [[QCD]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]] in that it is highly (super-)symmetric and conformal, it is still similar enough (being a nonabelian [[gauge theory]] [[minimal coupling|minimally coupled]] to [[fermions]]) that one can or can hope to deduce from these exact results approximate information about these less symmetric theories. 

In other words, because understanding [[observables]] in [[QCD]]/[[Yang-Mills theory]] in general is difficult, going to special points in the space of all such theories -- such as the point of N=4, D=4 SYM -- may be hoped to yield a tractable approximation. For more on this way of studying [[QCD]] and other realistic theories by studying instead their highly symmetric but phenomenologically unrealistic siblings, see also at _[[string theory results applied elsewhere]]_.


### Holography, AdS-CFT

$N=4$ $d=4$ SYM is supposed to be related under the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] to [[type II superstring theory]] [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactified]] on a 5-[[sphere]] to an asymptotically [[anti de Sitter spacetime]].

### Twistor space formulation

There is a natural reformulation of the theory using [[twistor]] [[field (physics)|fields]]. See the references [below](#ReferencesTwistorSpace). And see at _[[twistor string theory]]_.

### Topological twists

There is a topological twist of 4d SYM to a [[TQFT]] -- the [[Kapustin-Witten TQFT]]. Its [[S-duality]] is supposed to contain [[geometric Langlands duality]] as a special case.

See at _[[topologically twisted D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]_.
