A [[ring]] $R$ is **simple** if it is it is a [[simple object]] in the category of $R$-$R$-[[bimodules]].

This can be stated in more elementary terms in any of the following equivalent ways:

*  $R$ is nontrivial and has no nontrivial two-sided [[ideal]]s.
*  $R$ has exactly two two-sided ideals (which must be $R$ itself and its [[zero ideal]]).

In [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] algebra, this is too strong; we must say:

*  For each two-sided ideal $I$, $I$ is the zero ideal if and only if $I$ is proper (not equal to $R$).

## Examples 

* A [[field]], or a [[division ring]], is simple. 

* If $D$ is a division ring, then the ring of $n \times n$ [[matrices]] $M_n(D)$ with entries in $D$ is a simple ring. 

* The [[Weyl algebra]] $k[x, y]/(x y - y x - 1)$ over a field $k$ is a simple ring.
