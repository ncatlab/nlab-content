## Idea

The condition that an $\infty$-category is an [[n-category]] is (in general) not invariant under [[Joyal model structure|categorical equivalence]]. Hence there is no intrinsic characterization of the class of $n$-categories.

However there is such a description of the class of $\infty$-categories which are *equivalent* to $n$-categories. To make this more concrete the notion of a *minimal fibration* which is a inner fibration of simplicial sets satisfying a relative homotopy condition and that of a *minimal $\infty$-category* are introduced.

Every $\infty$-category is equivalent to a minimal $\infty$-category.

###### Definition
Let
$$\array{
A&\stackrel{u}{\to}&X
\\
\downarrow^i&&\downarrow^p
\\
B&\stackrel{v}{\to}&S}$$

denote a lifting problem. Then putative solutions $f,g$ of this lifting problem are called *homotopic relative $A$ over $S$* if they are equivalent as objects in the fiber of the map

$$X^B\to X^A\times_{S^A}S^B$$

Equivalently $f,g$ are homotopic relative $A$ over $B$ if there is a map

$$F:B\times \Delta[1]\to X$$

such that

$F|B\times\{0\}=f$

$F|B\times\{1\}=g$

$p\circ F=v\circ \pi_B$

$F\circ(i\times id_{\Delta[1]})=u\circ\pi_A$

$F|\{b\}\times \Delta[1]$

and $F|\{b\}\times\Delta[1]$ is an equivalence in the $\infty$-category $X_{v(b)}$ for every vertex $b$ of $B$.

###### Definition 2.3.3.1

Let $p : X \to S$ be an inner Ô¨Åbration of simplicial sets. $p$ is called *minimal inner fibration*  if $f = f^\prime$ for every pair of maps $f , f ^\prime : \Delta[n] \to X$ which are homotopic relative to $\partial \Delta[n]$ over $S$ . 

An $\infty$-category $C$ is called *minimal $\infty$-category* if $C\to *$ is minimal.
