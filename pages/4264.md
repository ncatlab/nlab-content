## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$, the [[open subspaces]] of $X$ form a [[poset]] which is in fact a [[frame]].  When thought of as a [[locale]], this is the __locale of open subspaces__ of $X$.


## Properties

If $X$ is a [[sober space]], we tend to identify it with its locale of opens.  Conversely, a locale has __[[locale with enough points|enough points]]__ if it is [[isomorphisms|isomorphic]] to the locale of opens of some space $X$.
