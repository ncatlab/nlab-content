## Idea

A degree-$p$ _calibration_ of an oriented [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is a [[differential p-form]] $\omega \in \Omega^p(X)$ with the property that 

1. it is closed $d \omega = 0$;

1. evaluated on any oriented $p$-dimensional subspace of any [[tangent space]] of $X$, it is less than or equal to the induced degree-$p$ [[volume form]], with equality for at least one choice of subspace.


A _calibrated submanifold_ of a manifold with calibration is an oriented [[submanifold]] such that restricted to each of its tangent spaces $\omega$ _equals_ the induced volume form of the submanifold there.

## Properties

### Minimal volume submanifolds

Any calibrated submanifold $\Sigma \hookrightarrow X$ minimizes [[volume]] in its [[homology]] class.

For Let $\tilde \Sigma \hookrightarrow X$ be a homologous [[submanifold]]. Then [[Stokes theorem]] together with the condition that $d \phi = 0$ implies that the [[integration of differential forms]] of $\phi$ over $\Sigma$ equals that over $\tilde \Sigma$. The defining conditions on calibrations and on calibrated submanifolds then imply the [[inequality]]

$$
  vol(\Sigma)
  \stackrel{cal\,subm}{=}
  \int_\Sigma \phi
  \stackrel{Stokes}{=} 
  \int_{\tilde \Sigma} \phi
  \stackrel{calib}{\leq}
  \int_{\tilde \Sigma} d vol
  =
  vol(\tilde \Sigma)
  \,.
$$

## Examples

* The globalization of the [[associative 3-form]] of a [[G2-manifold]] is a calibration. A calibrated submanifold in this case is alse called an [[associative submanifold]].
