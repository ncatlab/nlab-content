## Idea

A degree-$p$ _calibration_ of an oriented [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is a [[differential p-form]] $\omega \in \Omega^p(X)$ with the property that 

1. it is closed $d \omega = 0$;

1. evaluated on any oriented $p$-dimensional subspace of any [[tangent space]] of $X$, it is less than or equal to the induced degree-$p$ [[volume form]], with equality for at least one choice of subspace.

A Riemannian manifold equipped with such a calibration is also called a _calibrated geometry_ ([Harvey-Lawson 82](#HarveyLawson82)) or similar.

A _calibrated submanifold_ of a manifold with calibration is an oriented [[submanifold]] such that restricted to each of its tangent spaces $\omega$ _equals_ the induced volume form of the submanifold there.

## Properties

### Minimal volume submanifolds

Any calibrated submanifold $\Sigma \hookrightarrow X$ minimizes [[volume]] in its [[homology]] class.

For Let $\tilde \Sigma \hookrightarrow X$ be a homologous [[submanifold]]. Then [[Stokes theorem]] together with the condition that $d \phi = 0$ implies that the [[integration of differential forms]] of $\phi$ over $\Sigma$ equals that over $\tilde \Sigma$. The defining conditions on calibrations and on calibrated submanifolds then imply the [[inequality]]

$$
  vol(\Sigma)
  \stackrel{cal\,subm}{=}
  \int_\Sigma \phi
  \stackrel{Stokes}{=} 
  \int_{\tilde \Sigma} \phi
  \stackrel{calib}{\leq}
  \int_{\tilde \Sigma} d vol
  =
  vol(\tilde \Sigma)
  \,.
$$

### Calibrations from spinors

> under construction

For suitable $n$ and $p$, and given a real [[spin representation]] of $Spin(n)$, 
then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its canonical Riemannian structure
becomes $p$-calibrated with the calibration form being 

$$
  \omega_{\epsilon}
  \coloneqq 
  (\overline{\epsilon} \Gamma_{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_p} \epsilon) \, e^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e^{a_p}
$$

where 

1. $\{e^a\}$ denotes the canonical [[linear basis]] of [[differential 1-forms]];

1. $\epsilon$ is a non-vanishing [[spinor]];

1. $\overline{\epsilon} \Gamma_{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_p} \epsilon$ is the [canonical bilinear pairing](spin+representation#SpinorBilinearForms) which in components is given by evaluating $\epsilon$ in the [[quadratic form]] given by multiplying the skew-symmetrized product of $p$ of the representation matrices $\Gamma^a$ of the [[Clifford algebra]] with the [[charge conjugation matrix]] $C$.

(e.g. [Dadok-Harvey 93](#DadokHarvey93)).

For instance for $n = 7$ and $p = 3$ then this gives the [[associative 3-form]] calibration.

More generally for $X$ an $n$-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with a [[covariantly constant spinor]] $\epsilon$, then under suitable conditions applying this construction in each [[tangent space]] gives a calibration.

## Examples

* The globalization of the [[associative 3-form]] of a [[G2-manifold]] is a calibration. A calibrated submanifold in this case is alse called an [[associative submanifold]].
