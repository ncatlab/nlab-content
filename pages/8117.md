## Idea

Weinstein suggested that [[geometric quantization]] should yield a representation of a "[[category]]" whose

* objects are [[symplectic manifolds]] $(X, \omega)$;

* morphisms $(X_1,\omega_1) \to (X_2,\omega_2)$ are [[Lagrangian correspondences]]: [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] of $(X_1, \omega_1) \times (X_2, -\omega_2)$;

and composition is given by taking fiber products of these Lagrangian submanifolds.

However, this is not actually quite a category, since composition is only well-defined when the intersection of $L_1 \times L_2 \cap X_1 \times \Delta(X_2) \times X_3$ is [transverse](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transversal+maps).

Proposals for how to rectify this are in ([Wehrheim-Woodward](#WehrheimWoodward)) and in ([Kitchloo](#Kitchloo)) (by turning this into an [[(infinity,1)-category]]).

## Kitchloo approach

Kitchloo defines the stable symplectic category $\mathbb{S}$, which has as objects symplectic manifolds, and morphisms are certain [[Thom spectra]]
associated to [[Lagrangian correspondences]] $\overline{M} \times N$, where $\overline{M}$ denotes the conjugate with symplectic form $-\omega$.  One can view this as a category of symplectic [[motives]].

Considering an oriented version of the category $\mathbb{S}$, there is a canonical [[fiber functor]] $F : M \mapsto \mathbb{S}(pt, M)$, and one may consider the [[motivic Galois group]] $G$ of monoidal [[automorphisms]] of $F$.  It turns out to have a natural subgroup which is isomorphic to the quotient of the [[Grothendieck-Teichmuller group]].
