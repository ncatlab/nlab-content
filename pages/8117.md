## Idea

Weinstein suggested that [[geometric quantization]] should yield a representation of a "[[category]]" whose

* objects are symplectic manifolds $(X, \omega)$;

* morphisms $(X_1,\omega_1) \to (X_2,\omega_2)$ are [[Lagrangian correspondences]]: Lagrangian submanifolds of $(X_1, \omega_1) \times (X_2, -\omega_2)$;

and composition is given by taking fiver products of these Lagrangian submanifolds.

However, this is not actually quite a category, since composition is only well-defined when the intersection of $L_1 \times L_2 \cap X_1 \times \Delta(X_2) \times X_3$ is [transverse](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transversal+maps).

Proposal for how to rectify this are in ([Wehrheim-Woodward](#WehrheimWoodward)) and in ([Kitchloo](#Kitchloo)) (by turning this into an [[(infinity,1)-category]]).
