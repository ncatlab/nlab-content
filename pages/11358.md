## Idea

In [[string theory]] the term _half-twisted model_ refers to a [[topological twist]] of the [[2d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] (see there for more) which is "in-between" the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]].

## References

The half-twisted model was introduced in

* {#Witten91} [[Edward Witten]], _Mirror Manifolds And Topological Field Theory_, AMS IP studies in Advanced mathematics 9 (1998): 121-160. ([arXiv:hep-th/9112056](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112056))

as a variant of the [[A-model]]/[[B-model]],
