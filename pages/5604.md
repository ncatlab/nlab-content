# Complete small categories

## Definition

A **complete small category** (or **small complete category**) is a [[category]] which is both [[small category|small]] (has only a [[set]] of [[objects]] and [[morphisms]]) and [[complete category|complete]] (has a [[limit]] of every small [[diagram]]).

(Note that the phrase "[[small-complete category]]" is sometimes used to mean merely a complete category, i.e. one which is "complete relative to small diagrams".  Therefore, "complete small category" is a safer term for our concept.)


## In classical logic

In the presence of [[classical logic]], complete small categories reduce to [[complete lattices]] by the following theorem of Freyd.

###### Theorem

If (in some [[universe]] $U$) a small [[category]] $D$ has [[product]]s of families of objects whose size is at least that of its set of morphisms, then $D$ is a [[preorder]].  In particular, any complete small category is a [[preorder]].

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof

Let $x$, $y$ be any two objects, and suppose (contrary to $D$ being a preorder) that there are at least two different morphisms $x \,\underoverset{s}{r}{\rightrightarrows}\, y$. Then the set of morphisms 

$$x \to \prod_{f \in Mor(D)} y$$ 

has [[cardinality]] at least $2^{|Mor(D)|} \gt {|Mor(D)|}$, which is a contradiction.

## In Grothendieck toposes

The [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]] is not, in general, classical, so the above proof does not apply when considering [[internal categories]] in a topos.  However, in a [[Grothendieck topos]], one can show that the conclusion still holds by essentially reducing the question to the analogous one in $Set$.  A brief description of the argument can be found in the answer to [this question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/43433/small-complete-categories-in-a-grothendieck-topos).


## In more general toposes and constructive mathematics

However, it is possible to have non-preorder complete small categories in non-Grothendieck topoi.  In particular, the [[effective topos]], along with most other [[realizability topos|realizability toposes]], does contain such internal categories.  These categories have applications to the modeling of impredicative [[type theory]].

It follows that, in [[constructive mathematics]], it is impossible to prove even that every complete small category in $Set$ or in a Grothendieck topos must be a preorder.
