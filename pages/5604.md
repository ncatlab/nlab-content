## Definition

A **complete small category** (or **small complete category**) is a [[category]] which is both [[small category|small]] (has only a [[set]] of [[objects]] and [[morphisms]]) and [[complete category|complete]] (has a [[limit]] of every small [[diagram]]).

(Note that the phrase "[[small-complete category]]" is sometimes used to mean merely a complete category, i.e. one which is "complete relative to small diagrams".  Therefore, "complete small category" is a safer term for our concept.)


## In classical logic

In the presence of [[classical logic]], complete small categories reduce to [[complete lattices]] by the following theorem of [[Peter Freyd]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

If (in some [[universe]] $U$) a small [[category]] $D$ has [[products]] of families of objects whose size is at least that of its [[hom-set|set of morphisms]], then $D$ is a [[preorder]].  In particular, any complete small category is a [[preorder]].

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof

Let $x$, $y$ be any two objects, and suppose (contrary to $D$ being a preorder) that there are at least two different morphisms $x \,\underoverset{s}{r}{\rightrightarrows}\, y$. Then the set of morphisms 

$$x \to \prod_{f \in Mor(D)} y$$ 

has [[cardinality]] at least $2^{|Mor(D)|} \gt {|Mor(D)|}$, which is a contradiction.

## In Grothendieck toposes

The [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]] is not, in general, [[classical logic|classical]], so the above proof does not apply when considering [[internal categories]] in a topos.  However, in a [[Grothendieck topos]], one can show that the conclusion still holds by essentially reducing the question to the analogous one in [[Set]].  A brief description of the argument can be found in the answer to [this question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/43433/small-complete-categories-in-a-grothendieck-topos).


## In more general toposes and constructive mathematics

However, it is possible to have non-preorder complete small categories in non-Grothendieck topoi.  In particular, the [[effective topos]], along with most other [[realizability topos|realizability toposes]], does contain such internal categories, arising for example from the [[modest sets]] or [[partial equivalence relations]].  See [Hyland88](#Hyland88) and [HRR90](#HRR90) for details.

It follows that, in [[constructive mathematics]], it is impossible to prove even that every complete small category in $Set$ or in a Grothendieck topos must be a preorder.

There is a subtlety, however, because in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]], there is a difference between a category being "strongly complete" in the sense of being equipped with limit-assigning [[functors]], and being "weakly complete" in the sense that there merely *exists* a limit for every diagram.  The complete small categories in realizability toposes are only weakly complete, which categorically means that only the [[stack]] completions of their corresponding [[indexed categories]] are complete in the relevant indexed-category sense.

It seems to be unknown whether there exists a (necessarily non-Grothendieck) topos containing a *strongly* complete small category.  However, one of the complete small categories in the effective topos does become strongly complete when the ambient context is restricted to the subcategory of [[assemblies]] rather than the entire effective topos.


## Modelling impredicative type theory

Complete small categories have applications to the modeling of impredicative [[polymorphism]].  Suppose that there is a full subcategory $\mathbf C$ of $\mathbf{Set}$ that is small and complete.  Then we can interpret an impredicatively-quantified type as
\[\llbracket \forall X.T \rrbracket = \prod_{A\in \mathbf{C}} \llbracket T\rrbracket_{A/X}\]
although there are more elaborate formulations that use a subset of this product.

At least at first glance, this requires $\mathbf{C}$ to be *strongly* complete.  Hence it works in the category of assemblies, but not the entire realizability topos.

An alternative approach is to suppose that there is a full [[replete subcategory]] $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbf{Set}$ which is complete in the sense of being closed under set-indexed products and equalizers, yet [[essentially small]], i.e. with a small skeleton $\mathbf C$. (Being replete, $\mathcal{C}$ will not itself be small.)  Such a category can be obtained as the repletion of any *weakly* complete *actually* small subcategory, such as exist in realizability toposes.  See [RS04](#RS04) and [MS09](#MS09).  The interpretation of the impredicative $\forall$ is then achieved by a product over the sets in the small skeleton $\mathbf C$. However, to eliminate terms of type $\forall$, one must pick an isomorphism to a set in the skeleton, and be confident that the choice does not matter, and for this reason a relational parametricity is built in to the interpretation of $\forall$. In more detail:
\[\llbracket \forall X.T \rrbracket = \{\pi\in \prod_{A\in \mathbf{C}} \llbracket T\rrbracket_{A/X} | \forall R\subseteq A\times B. \mathcal{R}_R(
\pi(A),\pi(B))\}
\]
where $\mathcal{R}_R$ is a binary logical relation, suitably defined, and 
\[
\llbracket (t:\forall X.T)(U)\rrbracket = 
gpd(i)(\llbracket t\rrbracket_D) 
\]
where $i\colon D \to \llbracket U\rrbracket$ is a bijection with a set in the skeleton $\mathbf C$, and we are using the fact that for any bijection $j\colon C\to D$, there is a functorial action $gpd(j)\llbracket T\rrbracket_{C/X}\to \llbracket T\rrbracket_{D/X}.$ 
For discussion about whether this works, see the nForum thread for this page.

Note that to model polymorphic simple type theory such as [[System F]], it is not necessary for this purpose that $\mathbf{C}$ be *complete*; all it needs is to have products indexed by its own set of *objects*.  Freyd's theorem does not apply in this case, since there might be fewer objects than morphisms; and indeed there are plenty of categories even classically that have products indexed by their set of objects, e.g. any one-object category.  It is true, however, that (assuming classical logic) no *full subcategory of $Set$* can have products indexed by its own set of objects; this (and a bit more) was shown in [Reynolds 84](#Reynolds84), again by reducing to Cantor's diagonal argument.  On the other hand, to break this argument we do not have to move to realizability; Grothendieck toposes suffice, as shown in [Pitts 87](#Pitts87) via the [[Yoneda embedding]] of a syntactic model into its topos of presheaves.

In contrast, something more like a true complete small category may be necessary to model an impredicative dependent type theory such as the [[calculus of constructions]] with a proof-relevant impredicative sort (traditionally called "Set"), where the impredicative universe admits [[Pi-types]] with *arbitrary* domain.
