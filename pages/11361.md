## Idea

The [[chiral de Rham complex]] [[sheaf of vertex operator algebras]] of a [[complex manifold]] admits a [[resolution]] by a [[fine sheaf]] which in degree-0 is the Dolbeault-resolution of the [[structure sheaf]]. This is the  _chiral Dolbeault complex_ ([Cheung 10](#Cheung10)).

Where the construction of the [[chiral de Rham complex]] as a [[sheaf of vertex operator algebras]] requires the complex analog of a [[string structure]] in that the [[second Chern class]] vanishes, the construction of the chiral Dolbeault complex requires an analog of a [[differential string structure]] where a differential 3-form is chosen such that $\mathbf{d}H \propto \langle R \wedge R\rangle$.
