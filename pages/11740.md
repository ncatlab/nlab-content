## Idea

In a [[derived category]] of [[chain complexes]], or more generally in a [[triangulated category]] or in fact in a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], an _exceptional collection_ of object is a [[set]] of [[objects]] such that the [[Ext]]-groups ([[(infinity,1)-categorical hom-space|hom-spaces]]) between them are concentrated in degree 0. It is a _full exceptional collection_ if in addition it generates the category.

an exceptional collection in the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]]on a suitable [[Calabi-Yau variety]] [[cone]] is used to induce a [[quiver]] and make the derived category be equivalent to that of its [[quiver representations]].
