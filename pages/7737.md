## Idea

A notion of _stratified space_ is supposed to be a notion of [[topological space]] that is not necessarily a [[manifold]], but which is [[filtered topological space|filtered]] into "strata" that are.

Examples include [[polyhedra]], [[algebraic varieties]], [[orbit spaces]] of many group actions on manifolds and [[mapping cylinders]] of maps between manifolds.

There are various ways in the literature to make this precise.

Among them are 

* [[stratifolds]], [[orbifolds]], ...

## Related concepts

Maybe one can assign a [[fundamental category]] to a stratified space.

* [[stratification]]
