## Idea

A notion of _stratified space_ is supposed to be a notion of [[topological space]] that is not necessarily a [[manifold]], but which is [[filtered topological space|filtered]] into "strata" that are.

Examples include [[polyhedra]], [[algebraic varieties]], [[orbit spaces]] of many group actions on manifolds and [[mapping cylinders]] of maps between manifolds.

## Definitions

There are various ways in the literature to make this precise, including:

* [[stratifolds]]
* [[orbifolds]]
* [[poset-stratified space]]

## Examples

* the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] has a natural stratification by [[height of a formal group|height of formal groups]].

## Related concepts

* Maybe one can assign a [[fundamental category]] to a stratified space.  This has been studied for [[poset-stratified spaces]] -- see there under "exit path $\infty$-category" for more.

* [[stratification]]
