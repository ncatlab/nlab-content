## Idea

In [[type theory]], a **negative type** is one whose *eliminators* are regarded as primary.  Its constructors are derived from these by the rule that "to construct an element of a negative type, it is necessary and sufficient to specify how that element behaves upon applying all of the eliminators to it".

The opposite notion is a [[positive type]], forming two [[polarity in type theory|polarities]].

In [[categorical semantics]] of type theory, negative types correspond to "from the right" universal properties (i.e. for mapping in).

In [[denotational semantics]], negative types behave well with respect to "call-by-name" and other [[lazy evaluation]] strategies.


## Examples

* [[dependent product type]]

  * [[function type]]

* [[coinductive type]]

* cartesian [[product types]] can be presented both positively and negatively.  The two definitions are equivalent in ordinary type theory, but distinct in [[linear logic]].  The same is true of binary [[sum types]] if we allow [[sequents]] with multiple conclusions.
