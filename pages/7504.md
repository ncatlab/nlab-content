## Idea

In [[type theory]], a **negative type** is one whose *eliminators* are regarded as primary.  Its constructors are derived from these by the rule that "to construct an element of a negative type, it is necessary and sufficient to specify how that element behaves upon applying all of the eliminators to it".

In [[categorical semantics]] of type theory, negative types correspond to "from the right" universal properties (i.e. for mapping in).

## Examples

* [[function type]]

* [[dependent product type]]

* [[coinductive type]]

* cartesian [[product types]] can be presented both positively and negatively, as can binary [[sum types]].  The two definitions are equivalent in ordinary type theory, but distinct in [[linear logic]].
