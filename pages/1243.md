## Definition

The **torsion subgroup** of a [[group]] is the [[subgroup]] of all those elements $g$, which have finite [[order]], i.e. those for which $g^n = e$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

A group is **torsion-free** if there is no such element apart from the neutral element $e$ itself, i.e. when the torsion subgroup is trivial.

Given a [[ring]] $R$, an element $m$ in an $R$-[[module]] $M$ is **torsion element** if there is a nonzero element $r$ in $R$ such that $r m=0$. A **torsion module** is a module whose elements are all torsion. A torsion-free module is a module whose elements are not torsion, other than $0$. 

Torsion and torsion-free classes of objects in an [[abelian category]] were introduced axomatically as a [[torsion theory]] (or torsion pair) in ([Dickson](#Dickson)).

Notice that there are other, completely independent, concepts reffered to as _[[torsion]]_. See there for more.

## Properties

### Relation to the $Tor$-functor

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $A$ an [[abelian group]], its torsion subgroup is isomorphic to the value of the degree-1 [[Tor functor]] $Tor^\mathbb{Z}_1(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}, A)$.

### Relation to flatness

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

An [[abelian group]] is torsion-free precisely if regarded as a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[module]] it is a [[flat module]].

=--

This is a special case of a [more general result](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/principal+ideal+domain#flat) for modules over a principal ideal domain. See also _[flat module - Examples](flat+module#Examles)_ for more.


## Examples and applications 

* In [[rational homotopy theory]] one considers the [[homotopy group]]s $\pi_n(X)$ of [[topological space]]s $X$ tensored over $\mathbb{Q}$: the resulting groups $\pi_n(X) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$ are then necessarily torsion-free -- in this sense [[rational homotopy theory]] studies spaces "up to torsion".
