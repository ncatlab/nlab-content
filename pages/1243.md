The **torsion subgroup** of a [[group]] is the subgroup of all those elements $g$, which have finite order, i.e. those for which $g^n = e$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

A group is **torsion free** if there is no such element apart from the neutral element $e$ itself, i.e. when the torsion subgroup is trivial.

# Examples and applications #

* In [[rational homotopy theory]] one considers the [[homotopy group]]s $\pi_n(X)$ of [[topological space]]s $X$ tensored over $\mathbb{Q}$: the resulting groups $\pi_n(X) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$ are then necessarily torsion free -- in this sense [[rational homotopy theory]] studies spaces "up to torsion".


#Remarks#

* Notice that there is no relation to the [[torsion]] of a connection.
