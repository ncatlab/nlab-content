## Idea

Given any [[object]] $X$ in any [[category]] $C$, the [[subobjects]] of $X$ form a [[poset]] (though in general it may be a [[large category|large]] one, i.e. a partially ordered [[proper class]]; cf. [[well-powered category]]). This is called, naturally enough, the __poset of subobjects__ of $X$, or the __subobject poset__ of $X$.

Sometimes it is the __poset of [[regular subobjects]]__ that really matters (although these are the same in any ([[pretopos|pre]])[[topos]]).


## Properties

If $C$ is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]], then the subobjects form a meet-[[semilattice]], so we may speak of the __semilattice of subobjects__.  

In any [[coherent category]] (such as a [[pretopos]]), the subobjects form a distributive [[lattice]], so we may speak of the __lattice of subobjects__.  

In any [[Heyting category]] (such as a [[topos]]), the subobjects of $X$ form a [[Heyting algebra]], so we may speak of the __algebra of subobjects__.  

The reader can probably think of other variations on this theme.

## Related concepts

* If one opts for the alternative[^1] definition that subobjects _are_ monomorphisms into the object (not isomorphism classes thereof), then one gets a [[preorder]] of subobjects instead. In any case, the *poset* of [[subobjects]] $Sub(X)$ in our sense is the posetal reflection of the preorder $Mono(X)$ of subobjects in the alternative sense, and of course the reflection quotient map $Mono(X) \to Sub(X)$ is an [[equivalence]].
