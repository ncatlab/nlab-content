## Idea

Given any [[object]] $X$ in any [[category]] $C$, the [[subobjects]] of $X$ form a [[poset]], called (naturally enough) the __poset of subobjects__ of $X$, or the __subobject poset__ of $X$.

Sometimes it is the __poset of [[regular subobjects]]__ that really matters (although these are the same in any ([[pretopos|pre]])[[topos]]).


## Properties

If $C$ is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]], then the subobjects form a meet-[[semilattice]], so we may speak of the __semilattice of subobjects__.  

In any [[coherent category]] (such as a [[pretopos]]), the subobjects form a distributive [[lattice]], so we may speak of the __lattice of subobjects__.  

In any [[Heyting category]] (such as a [[topos]]), the subobjects of $X$ form a [[Heyting algebra]], so we may speak of the __algebra of subobjects__.  

The reader can probably think of other variations on this theme.
