## Idea

A [[topological space]] is _totally bounded_ if it may be [[covering|covered]] by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size.

The [[Heine-Borel theorem]], which states that a [[closed subset|closed]] and [[bounded subset|bounded]] [[subset]] of the [[real line]] is [[compact space|compact]] (in the finite open subcover sense), applies to all [[Euclidean spaces]] but not to general [[metric spaces]].  However, if we use two facts about the real line (which hold for all cartesian spaces) ---that a subset is [[closed subspace|closed]] if and only if it is [[complete space|complete]] and that a subset is [[bounded space|bounded]] if and only if it is _totally bounded_---, then we get a theorem that *does* apply to all metric spaces (at least assuming the [[axiom of choice]]): that a complete and totally bounded space is compact.

The concept (and the Heine--Borel theorem, in this sense) apply not only to metric spaces but to [[uniform spaces]]; like completeness, total boundedness is a uniform property.


## Definition

### Basic definitions

In the following definitions, '[[finite set|finite]]' means Kuratowski-finite, or finitely indexed, for the purposes of [[constructive mathematics]].  All of these definitions are constructively equivalent.

The slickest definition for [[uniform spaces]] is probably this one:

+-- {: .num_defn #slick}
###### Definition

A uniform space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if every [[uniform cover]] of $X$ has a finite subcover.
=--

Since uniform covers are not a common approach to uniform spaces, we unwrap the definition of uniform covers in terms of entouranges to get this definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #uniform}
###### Definition

A uniform space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if, for every [[entourage]] $U$ of $X$, there is a finite [[open cover]] $\mathcal{C}$ of $X$ such that every set $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $G \times G \subseteq U$.
=--

In fact, it is enough to consider only basic entourages for some [[base]] of the uniformity.  Thus, we may specialise to [[gauge spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #gauge}
###### Definition

A gauge space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if, for every gauging distance $d$ of $X$, there is a finite open cover $\mathcal{C}$ of $X$ such that every set in $\mathcal{C}$ has $d$-diameter less than $1$.
=--

In fact, it is enough to consider only basic gauging distances for some base of the gauge, or even for some [[subbase]] of the gauge if we make the requirement for arbitrarily small diameters (rather than the fixed diameter $1$ as above).  Thus, we may specialise to [[metric spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #metric}
###### Definition

A metric space $X$ is __totally bounded__ if, for every positive number $\epsilon$, there is a finite open cover $\mathcal{C}$ of $X$ such that every set in $\mathcal{C}$ has diameter less than $\epsilon$.
=--


### Precompact spaces

Here is another definition of total boundedness, different in style from the others.  It makes sense even more generally, for any [[Cauchy space]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #precompact}
###### Definition

A Cauchy space $X$ is __precompact__ if its [[complete space|completion]] $\overline{X}$ is compact.
=--

It is immediate that a Cauchy space is compact if and only if it is both complete and precompact.

Every precompact uniform space is totally bounded; using Definition \ref{slick}, this may be proved by checking that any uniform cover of $X$ generates a uniform cover of $\overline{X}$.  The converse, that every totally bounded space is precompact, is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]].  Of course, many totally bounded spaces may be proved precompact on weaker assumptions; in particular, that a bounded subset of a cartesian space is precompact is equivalent to the [[fan theorem]] (and so also follows from the principle of [[excluded middle]]), a fact related to the [[Heineâ€“Borel theorem]].

### Proximity spaces

The category of totally bounded uniform spaces and uniformly continuous functions is equivalent to the category of [[proximity spaces]] and proximally continuous functions.  Thus, proximity spaces can be considered yet another axiomatization of "totally bounded space" that doesn't rely on a pre-existing kind of "space".



## Properties

All of these results hold constructively unless otherwise noted.

Every [[compact space]] is totally bounded; this is immediate from Definition \ref{slick}, since every uniform cover is an open cover.  Conversely, if one assumes the [[ultrafilter principle]], then every [[complete space|complete]] and totally bounded space is compact.  In [[constructive mathematics]], "complete and totally bounded" is sometimes taken as a definition of "compact" -- see [[Bishop-compact space]].

Any [[product]] of totally bounded spaces is totally bounded.  The totally bounded subspaces of a given space $X$ form an [[ideal]] in the [[power set]] of $X$.

A [[subspace]] of a [[Cartesian space]] is totally bounded if and only if it is [[bounded space|bounded]].  Every totally bounded metric space is [[separable space|separable]].
