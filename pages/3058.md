A version of Gabriel's 1960 PhD thesis has been published as [[Des catégories abéliennes]] in 1962. His thesis was a major breakthrough in the theory of [[localization]], and the study of [[abelian categories]], including categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on schemes. In retrospective, it can be said that it was in its ideas and methods one of the starting points of modern [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] as well. 

Gabriel assisted [[Grothendieck]] in reformulating the [[pseudofunctor]] version of [[descent theory]] in invariant (property characterized way) i.e. as [[fibered categories]] which he wrote up under the guidance of Grothendieck in SGA I.6. Gabriel contributed to some other parts of SGA, namely in study of [[group schemes]] and [[formal schemes]], e.g. in SGA III.2 (Exp. 7a, P. Gabriel, Étude infinitésimale des schémas en groupe et groupes formels; Exp. 7b, P. Gabriel, Groupes formels). Soon after with Demazure writes a first tome of an unfinished but monumental work on [[algebraic group]]s which, more than EGA, emphasised [[functor of points]] view.

With Zisman he introduced a general localization method in homotopy theory (see also [[calculus of fractions]] and [[Gabriel-Zisman]]):

In later part of his mathematical career, Gabriel worked on representation theory of finite-dimensional associative algebras and quivers, where he found some of the basic theorems. 

Some of the $n$lab entries related to Gabriel's work include [[Gabriel filter]], [[Gabriel composition of filters]], [[Gabriel multiplication]], [[Gabriel-Ulmer duality]] and we mention here and there Gabriel localization, Gabriel spectrum of indecomposable injectives, Gabriel--Popescu embedding theorem, Gabriel--Rosenberg [[reconstruction theorem]], Gabriel--Zisman localization and Gabriel's property (sup) in the theory of abelian categories.

Students of Gabriel include [[Bernhard Keller]]. Gabriel has also an important work in pure [[category theory]] on [[locally presentable categories]]:
