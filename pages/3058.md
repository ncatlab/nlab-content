## Selected writings


A version of Gabriel's 1960 PhD thesis has been published as *[[Des catégories abéliennes]]* in 1962. His thesis was a major breakthrough in the theory of [[localization]], and the study of [[abelian categories]], including categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on schemes. In retrospective, it can be said that it was in its ideas and methods one of the starting points of modern [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] as well. 

Gabriel assisted [[Grothendieck]] in reformulating the [[pseudofunctor]] version of [[descent theory]] in invariant (property characterized way) i.e. as [[fibered categories]] which he wrote up under the guidance of Grothendieck in SGA I.6. Gabriel contributed to some other parts of SGA, namely in study of [[group schemes]] and [[formal schemes]], e.g. in SGA III.2 (Exp. 7a, P. Gabriel, &#201;tude infinit&#233;simale des sch&#233;mas en groupe et groupes formels; Exp. 7b, P. Gabriel, Groupes formels). Soon after with Demazure writes a first tome of an unfinished but monumental work on [[algebraic group]]s which, more than EGA, emphasised [[functor of points]] view. 

On [[algebraic groups]]:

* M. Demazure, P. Gabriel, _Groupes algebriques_, tome 1 (later volumes never appeared), Mason and Cie, Paris 1970 

With Zisman he introduced a general localization method in homotopy theory (see also [[calculus of fractions]] and [[Gabriel-Zisman]]): 

* P. Gabriel, M. Zisman, _Calculus of fractions and homotopy theory_, Springer 1967. Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete, Band 35.

On [[locally presentable categories]]:

* [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Friedrich Ulmer]], *Lokal präsentierbare Kategorien*, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 221, Springer 1971 ([doi:10.1007/bfb0059396](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bfb0059396), [MR0327863](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0327863)).


In later part of his mathematical career, Gabriel worked on representation theory of finite-dimensional associative algebras and [[quivers]], where he found some of the basic theorems, see _[[Gabriel's theorem]]_.
