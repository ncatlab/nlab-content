## Idea

A [[topological space]] (or more generally, a [[convergence space]]) is _Hausdorff_ if [[convergence]] is unique.  The concept can also be defined for [[locales]] (see Definition \ref{proper} below) and [[categorification|categorified]] (see [Beyond topological spaces](#BeyondTopologicalSpaces) below).  A Hausdorff space is often called $T_2$, since this condition came second in the original list of four [[separation axioms]] (there are more now) satisfied by [[metric spaces]].

Hausdorff spaces are a kind of [[nice topological space]]; they do not form a particularly [[nice category of spaces]] themselves, but many such nice categories consist of only Hausdorff spaces.  In fact, [[Felix Hausdorff]]\'s original definition of 'topological space' actually required the space to be Hausdorff, hence the name.  Certainly [[homotopy theory]] (up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]) needs only Hausdorff spaces.  It is also common in analysis to assume that all spaces encountered are Hausdorff; if necessary, this can be arranged since every space has a Hausdorff quotient (in fact, the Hausdorff spaces form a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Top]]), although usually an easier method is available than this sledgehammer.


## Definitions
 {#Definitions}

There are many equivalent ways of characterizing a space $S$ as __Hausdorff__. The traditional definition is this:

+-- {: .num_defn #classical}
###### Definition

Given points $x$ and $y$ of $S$, if $x \neq y$, then there exist [[open neighbourhoods]] $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ in $S$ that are [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]]: such that their [[intersection]] $U \cap V$ is the [[empty set]] (or explicitly, such that $x' \ne y'$ whenever $x' \in U$ and $y' \in V$).
=--

That is, any two distinct points can be _separated_ by open neighbourhoods, and it is simply a mundane way of saying that $\ne$ is [[open subset|open]] in the [[product topology]] on $S \times S$.


Here is a classically equivalent definition that is more suitable for [[constructive mathematics]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #constructive}
###### Definition

Given points $x$ and $y$ of $S$, if every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ in $S$ meets every neighbourhood $V$ of $y$ in $S$ (which means that $U \cap V$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]]), then $x = y$.
=--

This is the mundane way of saying that $=$ is [[closed subset|closed]] in $S \times S$.

Another way of saying this, which makes sense also for [[locales]], is the following:

+-- {: .num_defn #proper}
###### Definition

The [[diagonal]] embedding $S \to S \times S$ is a [[proper map]] (or equivalently a [[closed map]], since any closed subspace inclusion is proper).
=--

This way of stating the definition generalizes to [[topos theory]] and thus to many other contexts; but it is not always a faithful generalization of the classical notion for topological spaces.  See _[Beyond topological spaces](#BeyondTopologicalSpaces)_ below for more.


Here is an equivalent definition (constructively equivalent to Definition \ref{constructive}) that makes sense for arbitrary [[convergence spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #convergence}
###### Definition

Given a [[net]] (or equivalently, a proper [[filter]]) in $S$, if it converges to both $x$ and $y$, then $x = y$.
=--

That is, convergence in a Hausdorff space is unique.

### Hausdorff reflection
 {#HausdorffReflection}

+-- {: .num_prop #Hausdorffication}
###### Proposition
**(Hausdorff reflection)**

For every [[topological space]] $X$ there exists
a [[Hausdorff topological space]] $H X$ 
and a [[continuous function]]

$$
  h_X
    \;\colon\;
  X \longrightarrow H X
$$

which is the  "closest approximation from the left" to $X$ by a Hausdorff topological space, in that
for $Y$ any [[Hausdorff topological space]], then [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

are in [[bijection]] with [[continuous function]] of the form

$$
  \tilde f \;\colon\; H X \longrightarrow Y
$$

and such that the bijection is constituted by

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ h_X
  \;\colon\;
    X
      \overset{h_X}{\longrightarrow}
    H X
      \overset{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow}
    Y
  \,.
$$


Here $H X$ (or more precisely $h_X$) is also called the _Hausdorff reflction_ or _Hausdorff reflection of $X$.

Specifically, consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on the underlying set $X$
for which $x \sim y$ precisely if for every [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ into any
[[Hausdorff topological space]] $Y$ we have $f(x) = f(y)$. Then the set of [[equivalence classes]]

$$
  H X \coloneqq X /{\sim}
$$

equipped with the [[quotient topology]] is the Hausdorff reflection of $X$,
and the comparison map $h_X$ is the quotient map $X \to X/{\sim}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that every continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ into a Hausdorff space $Y$
factors uniquely via $h_X$ through a continuous function $\tilde f$

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ h_X
$$

where

$$
  \tilde f \colon [x] \mapsto f(x)
  \,.
$$

That this is well defined and continuous follows directly from the definitions.

What remains to be seen is that $H X$ is indeed a Hausdorff space. Hence assume that $[x] \neq [y] \in H X$.
By construction of $H X$ this means that there exists a Hausdorff space $Y$ and a continuous function
$f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y) \in Y$. Accordingly, since $Y$ is Hausdorff,
there exist disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x, U_Y \in \tau_Y$. Moreover, by the previous statement there
exists a continuous function $\tilde f \colon H X \to Y$ with $\tilde f([x]) = f(x)$ and $\tilde f([y]) = f(y)$.
Since, by the nature of continuous functions,
the pre-images $\tilde f^{-1}( U_x ), \tilde f^{-1}([y]) \subset H X$ are still disjoint and open,
we have found disjoint neighbourhoods of $[x]$ and $[y]$. Hence $H X$ is Hausdorff.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In the language of [[category theory]] the Hausdorff reflection of prop. \ref{Hausdorffication}
says that [[Hausdorff topological spaces]] form a [[reflective subcategory]] of all [[topological spaces]].

$$
  Top_{Haus}
    \underoverset{\bot}{\overset{H}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow}}
  Top
  \,.
$$

### Monadicity

The topology on a [[compact space|compact]] Hausdorff space is given precisely by the (existent because compact, unique because Hausdorff) limit of each [[ultrafilter]] on the space.  Accordingly, compact Hausdorff topological spaces are (perhaps surprisingly) described by a (large) [[algebraic theory]].  In fact, the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is [[monadic functor|monadic]] (over [[Set]]); the [[monad]] in question maps each set to the set ultrafilters on it.  (The results of this paragraph require the [[ultrafilter theorem]], a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]; see [[ultrafilter monad]].)

A compact Hausdorff [[locale]] (or space) is necessarily [[regular locale|regular]]; a regular locale (or $T_0$ space) is necessarily Hausdorff.  Accordingly, [[locale]] theory usually speaks of 'compact regular' locales instead of 'compact Hausdorff' locales, since the definition of regularity is easier and more natural.  Then a version of the previous paragraph works for compact regular locales *without* the ultrafilter theorem, and indeed [[constructive mathematics|constructively]] over any [[topos]].


### Sobriety

Using [[classical logic]] (but not in [[constructive logic]]) every Hausdorff space is a [[sober topological space]]: _[[Hausdorff implies sober]]_.  


### Compact subspaces

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

[[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]].

=--



## Related notions

Arguably, the desire to make spaces Hausdorff ($T_2$) in analysis is really a desire to make them $T_0$; nearly every space that arises in analysis is at least [[regular space|regular]], and a regular $T_0$ space must be Hausdorff.  Forcing a space to be $T_0$ is like forcing a [[category]] to be [[skeletal category|skeletal]]; indeed, forcing a [[preorder]] to be a [[partial order]] is a special case of both (see [[specialisation topology]] for how).  It may be nice to assume, when working with a particular space, that it is $T_0$ but not to assume, when working with a particular underlying set, that every topology on it is $T_0$.

Whatever one thinks of that, there is a non-$T_0$ version of Hausdorff space, an __$R_1$ space__.  (The symbol here comes from being a weak version of a **r**egular space; in general a $T_i$ space is precisely both $R_{i-1}$ and $T_0$).  This is also called a __preregular space__ (in _[[HAF]]_) and a __reciprocal space__ (in convergence theory).

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (of $R_1$)
Given points $a$ and $b$, if every neighbourhood of $a$ meets every neighbourhood of $b$, then every neighbourhood of $a$ is a neighbourhood of $b$.  Equivalently, if any net (or proper filter) converges to both $a$ and $b$, then every net (or filter) that converges to $a$ also converges to $b$.
=--

There is also a notion of __sequentially Hausdorff space__:
+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (of sequentially Hausdorff)
Whenever a [[sequence]] converges to both $x$ and $y$, then $x = y$.
=--
Some forms of [[predicative mathematics]] find this concept more useful.  Hausdorffness implies sequential Hausdorffness, but the converse is false even for [[sequential space]]s (although it is true for [[first-countable space]]s).

The reader can now easily define a _sequentially $R_1$ space_.


## Beyond topological spaces
 {#BeyondTopologicalSpaces}

### Hausdorff locales

The most obvious definition for a [[locale]] $X$ to be **Hausdorff** is that its [[diagonal]] $X\to X\times X$ is a closed (and hence proper) inclusion.  However, if $X$ is a [[sober space]] regarded as a locale, this might not coincide with the condition for $X$ to be Hausdorff as a space, since the product $X\times X$ in the category of locales might not coincide with the product in the category of spaces.  But it does coincide if $X$ is a [[locally compact locale]], so in that case the two notions of Hausdorff are the same.


### Separated toposes and schemes

This notion of a _Hausdorff locale_ is a special case of that of _[[Hausdorff topos]]_ in [[topos theory]]. This also includes notions such as a _[[separated scheme]]_ etc.  The corresponding relative notion (over an arbitrary [[base topos]]) is that of _[[separated geometric morphism]]_. For schemes see _[[separated morphism of schemes]]_.


## In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], the Hausdorff notion multifurcates further, due to the variety of possible meanings of [[closed subspace]].  If we ask the diagonal to be *weakly* [[closed subspace|closed]], then in the spatial case, this means that it contains all its limit points, giving Definition \ref{constructive} above.  But if we ask the diagonal to be *strongly* closed, i.e. the complement of an open set, then in the spatial case this means that there is a [[tight inequality]] $\ne$ (the [[exterior]] of $=$) relative to which Definition \ref{classical} holds.  (We use $\ne$ twice in that definition: in the hypothesis that $x \ne y$ and in the conclusion that $x' \ne y'$.)

It is natural to call these conditions *weakly Hausdorff* and *strongly Hausdorff*, but one should be aware of terminological clashes: in classical mathematics there is a different notion of a [[weak Hausdorff space]], whereas (strong) Hausdorffness for locales has by some authors been called "strongly Hausdorff" only to contrast it with Hausdorffness for spaces.

As a simple example, consider a [[discrete space]] $X$ regarded as a locale.  Since it is locally compact, the locale product $X\times X$ coincides with the space product (a theorem that is valid constructively); but nevertheless we have:

1. The diagonal $X\to X\times X$ always has an open complement.
2. Definition \ref{constructive} above always holds, since $\{x\}$ and $\{y\}$ are neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, and if they intersect then $x=y$.  That is, $X$ is spatially weakly Hausdorff.
3. The diagonal $X\to X\times X$ is the complement of an open subset (i.e. $X$ is spatially strongly Hausdorff) if and only if equality in $X$ is stable under [[double negation]], in other words if $X$ admits a tight [[inequality relation]].
4. The locale diagonal $\Delta:X\to X\times X$ is a closed sublocale (i.e. $X$ is localically strongly Hausdorff) if and only if $X$ has [[decidable equality]].  For closedness of $\Delta$ means that $\Delta_\ast(U\cup \Delta^\ast(V)) \subseteq \Delta_\ast(U) \cup V$ for any $U\in O(X)$ and $V\in O(X\times X)$, where $x\in \Delta^\ast(V)$ means $(x,x)\in V$, while $(x,y)\in \Delta_\ast(U)$ means $(x=y)\to (x\in U)$.  Now let $U = \emptyset$ and $V = \{ (x,x) \mid x\in X \}$.  Then $(x,y) \in \Delta_\ast(U\cup \Delta^\ast(V))$ means $(x=y) \to (\bot \vee (x=x))$, which is a tautology; while $(x,y) \in \Delta_\ast(U) \cup V$ means $((x=y)\to \bot) \vee (x=y)$, i.e. $\neg(x=y) \vee (x=y)$.
5. I don't know what it means for $X$ to be localically weakly Hausdorff.  (Weak closure in locales is very inexplicit.)

In particular, the statement "all discrete locales are localically strongly Hausdorff" is equivalent to [[excluded middle]].

However, non-discrete spaces can constructively be localically strongly Hausdorff without having decidable equality.  For instance, any [[regular space]] is also regular as a locale, and hence localically strongly Hausdorff.  We can also say:

+-- {: .num_theorem #Apartness}
###### Theorem
In any topological space $X$, let $x\#y$ mean that there exist opens $U,V$ with $x\in U$ and $y\in V$ and $U\cap V = \emptyset$; then $\#$ is always an [[inequality relation]].  If the spatial product $X\times X$ coincides with the locale product (such as if $X$ is [[locally compact space|locally compact]]), then $X$ is localically strongly Hausdorff if and only if $\#$ is an [[apartness relation]] and every open set in $X$ is $\#$-open (i.e. for any $x\in U$ and $y\in X$ we have $y\in U \vee x\#y$).
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Note that $\#$ is, as a subset $W_\# \subseteq X\times X$, the exterior of the diagonal in the product topology, mentioned above.  If $X$ is localically strongly Hausdorff, then $W_\#$ *must* be the open set of which the diagonal is the complementary closed sublocale, since it is the largest open set disjoint from the diagonal.

To say that the diagonal *is* its complementary closed sublocale implies in particular that for any open set $U\subseteq X$, the open set $(U\times U) \cup W_\#$ is the largest open subset of $X\times X$ whose intersection with the diagonal is contained in $U\cap U = U$.  Specifically, therefore, $(U\times U) \cup W_\#$ contains $U\times X$ (since $U\times X$ is an open subset of $X\times X$ whose intersection with the diagonal is $U$).  That is, if $x\in U$ and $y\in X$, then either $(x,y)\in U\times U$ (i.e. $y\in U$) or $(x,y)\in W_\#$ (i.e. $x\#y$).  This shows that $U$ is $\#$-open.

To show that $\#$ is an apartness, note that for any $x$ the set $\{ z \mid x\# z \}$ is open, since it is the preimage of $W_\#$ under a section of the second projection $X\times X \to X$.  Thus, it is $\#$-open, which is to say that if $x\# z$ then for any $y$ either $x\#y$ or $y\#z$, which is the missing [[comparison]] axiom for $\#$ to be an apartness.

Conversely, suppose $\#$ is an apartness and every open set is $\#$-open (i.e. the apartness topology refines the given topology on $X$).  Let $A\subseteq X\times X$ be an open set; we must show that $A\cup W_\#$ is the largest open subset of $X\times X$ whose intersection with the diagonal is contained in $A\cap \Delta_X$.  In other words, suppose $U\times V$ is a basic open in $X\times X$ and $(U\times V)\cap \Delta_X$ (which is $U\cap V$) is contained in $A\cap \Delta_X$; we must show $U\times V\subseteq A\cup W_\#$.  In terms of elements, we assume that if $x\in U$ and $x\in V$ then $(x,x)\in A$, and we must show that if $x\in U$ and $y\in V$ then $(x,y)\in A \vee x\#y$.

Assuming $x\in U$ and $y\in V$, since $U$ and $V$ are $\#$-open we have either $y\in U$ or $x\# y$, and either $x\in V$ or $x\#y$.  Since we are done if $x\#y$, it suffices to assume $y\in U$ and $x\in V$.  Therefore, by assumption, $(x,x)\in A$ and $(y,y)\in A$.  Since $A$ is open in the product topology, we have opens $U',V'$ with $x\in U'$ and $y\in V'$ and $U'\times U'\subseteq A$ and $V'\times V' \subseteq A$.  But now $\#$-openness of $U'$ and $V'$ tells us again that either $x\#y$ (in which case we are done) or $y\in U'$ and $x\in V'$.  In the latter case, $(x,y)\in U'\times U'$ (and also $V'\times V'$), and hence is also in $A$.
=--

Note that the apartness $\#$ need not be [[tight relation|tight]], and in particular $X$ need not be spatially Hausdorff.  In particular, if $X$ might not even be $T_0$: since localic Hausdorffness is (of course) only a property of the open-set lattice, it only "sees" the [[sobrification]] and in particular the $T_0$ quotient.  However, this is all that can go wrong: if $\neg(x\# y)$, then by $\#$-openness every open set containing $x$ must also contain $y$ and vice versa, so if $X$ is $T_0$ then $x=y$ and $\#$ is tight.

If the locale product $X\times X$ does not coincide with the spatial product, then the "only if" direction of the above proof still works, if we define $W_\#$ to be the open part of the locale product $X\times X$ given by $W_\# = \bigvee \{ U\otimes V \mid U\cap V = \emptyset \}$.  A different proof is to recall that by [this theorem](/nlab/show/apartness+relation#ClosedLocalicEquivalenceRelation), an apartness relation is the same as a (strongly) closed equivalence relation on a discrete locale, and the quotient of such an equivalence relation is the $\#$-topology.  Thus, if $X$ is localically strongly Hausdorff, its diagonal is a closed equivalence relation, which yields by pullback a closed equivalence relation on the discrete locale $X_d$ on the same set of points.  This is the [[kernel pair]] of the canonical surjection $X_d \to X$, and hence its quotient (the $\#$-topology) maps to $X$, i.e. refines the topology of $X$.
