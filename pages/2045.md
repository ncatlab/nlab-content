An object $X$ in an [[abelian category]] $A$ is said to be __semisimple__ if it is a [[coproduct]] ([[direct sum]]) of [[simple objects]]. Example include semisimple left $R$-[[modules]] where $R$ is a [[ring]]. A semisimple object is __isotypic__ if it is a direct sum of isomorphic simple objects (the isomorphism class of a simple object is called its _type_).

Sometimes this notion is considered in a bit more general setup than abelian (where it is most often used); sometimes with subtle variants. For [[Lie algebras]], it is a bit different by convention: a Lie algebra is __semisimple__ if it is a direct sum of *nonabelian* simple Lie algebras; though a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is simple in the categorical (and in common) sense.
