###### Definition

An [[object]] $X$ in an [[abelian category]] $A$ is said to be __semisimple__ or __completely reducible__ if it is a [[coproduct]] ([[direct sum]]) of [[simple objects]].

###### Remark

Sometimes this notion is considered in a bit more general setup than [[abelian category|abelian]] (where it is most often used); sometimes with subtle variants. For [[Lie algebras]], it is a bit different by convention: a Lie algebra is a __[[semisimple Lie algebra]]__ if it is a [[direct sum]] of *nonabelian* simple Lie algebras; though a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is simple in the categorical (and in common) sense.

###### Definition

A semisimple object is __isotypic__ if it is a [[direct sum]] of [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] simple objects (the isomorphism class of a simple object is called its _type_).

## Special classes
