###### Theorem
**Cartan's theorem B**

On a [[Stein manifold]] $\Sigma$  and for $A$ an analytic [[coherent sheaf]] on $\Sigma$ then all the [[positive number|positive]]-degree [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] groups of $\Sigma$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ vanish:

$$
  H^{\bullet \geq 1}(\Sigma, A) = 0
  \,.
$$

This is recalled for instance as ([Forstnerič 11, theorem 2.4.1](#Forstneric11))

###### Theorem

Also all [[positive number|positive]]-degree [[Dolbeault cohomology]] groups vanish:

$$
  H^{\bullet, \bullet \geq 1}_{\bar \partial}(\Sigma) = 0
  \,.
$$

This is recalled for instance in  ([Forstnerič 11, theorem 2.4.6](#Forstneric11), [Gunning-Rossi](#GunningRossi)).
