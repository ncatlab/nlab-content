An element of a [[ring]] (or [[rig]]) or [[lattice]] is called __prime__ if the [[ideal]] that it generates a [[prime ideal]].

Note that by this definition [[zero]] is a prime element of the [[rig]] of [[natural numbers]], although it is not a [[prime number]].  Prime numbers correspond more closely to [[maximal ideals]] than to prime ideals.

Classically (using [[excluded middle]]), a prime element of a [[frame]] corresponds precisely to a [[point of a locale|point]] of the corresponding [[locale]].  For a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] treatment, however, one must use the [[completely prime filters]] of the frame instead.
