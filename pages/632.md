## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A [[functor]] $F:C\to D$ is **conservative** if it is "isomorphism-reflecting", i.e. if $g:a\to b$ is a [[morphism]] in $C$ such that $F(g)$ is an [[isomorphism]] in $D$, then $g$ is an isomorphism in $C$.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Sometimes conservative functors are assumed to be [[faithful functor|faithful]] as well.  If $C$ has, and $F$ preserves, [[equalizer]]s, then conservativity implies faithfulness.

See [[conservative morphism]] for a generalization to an arbitrary [[2-category]].

## Properties

###### Proposition

A conservative functor [[reflected limit|reflects]] all [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s that it [[preserved limit|preserves]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $K : J \to C$ be a [[diagram]] in $X$ whose limit $\lim K$ exists and such that $\lim F\circ K \simeq F \lim K$. Then if $const_\theta \to K$ is a [[cone]] in $F$ that is sent to a limiting cone $F const_\theta$ in $D$, then by the [[universal property]] of the limit in $D$ the morphism $F( const_\theta \to \lim K)$ is an isomorphism in $D$, hence must have been an isomorphism in $C$, hence $const_\theta$ must have been a limiting cone in $C$.

The arguments for colimits is analogous.
