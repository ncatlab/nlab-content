A [[functor]] $F:C\to D$ is **conservative** if it is "isomorphism-reflecting", i.e. if $g:a\to b$ is a [[morphism]] in $C$ such that $F(g)$ is an [[isomorphism]] in $D$, then $g$ is an isomorphism in $C$.

# Remarks #

* Sometimes conservative functors are assumed to be [[faithful functor|faithful]] as well.  If $C$ has, and $F$ preserves, [[equalizer]]s, then conservativity implies faithfulness.
