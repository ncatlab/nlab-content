# One-sided real numbers

## Summary

There are really two notions of one-sided real number: lower reals and upper reals.  But there is a perfect symmetry between them.

These are really concepts in [[constructive mathematics]].  Using [[excluded middle]], a one-sided real number is simply a [[real number]], but constructively they are more general (and less well behaved).

Actually, there is a small technicality: most naturally, a lower real may (classically) be either a real number or $\infty$, while an upper real may be either a real number or $-\infty$.  You can restrict to _bounded_ lower/upper reals to avoid that, or alternatively genralise to _extended_ lower/upper reals if you want to include both $\pm\infty$ at once.


## Idea

A __lower real number__ is the [[supremum]] of an [[inhabited set]] of [[real numbers]], or equivalently of an inhabited set of [[rational numbers]].  A __bounded lower real__ is the supremum of an inhabited set of numbers that has a finite upper bound.  An __extended lower real__ is the supremum of an arbitrary set of  real numbers.

An __upper real number__ is the [[infimum]] of an inhabited set of numbers.  A __bounded upper real__ is the infimum of an inhabited set of numbers that has a finite upper bound.  An __extended lower real__ is the supremum of an arbitrary set of numbers.

We cannot generalise further by taking more infima or suprema.  Explicitly, the supremum of any inhabited set of lower reals is a lower real and the infimum of any inhabited set of upper reals is an upper real.  In fact, the supremum of any inhabited set of bounded *upper* reals is a lower real, and conversely.  Similar results obtain if we manipulate 'bounded' and 'extended' to include or exclude $\pm\infty$, or to allow for infima and suprema of the [[empty subset|empty set]].
