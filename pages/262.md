## Definition

The term **simplicial category** has at least three common meanings.  Thus, to avoid ambiguity, it is perhaps better to avoid it entirely and use an equivalent, unambiguous term for the particular meaning one has in mind.

* The **simplicial category** $\Delta$ is the domain category for the presheaf category of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].  This is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on categories which are linear [[quiver]]s, or equivalently the category of finite, non-empty totally ordered sets and order-preserving functions between them.  To avoid ambiguity, $\Delta$ may also be called the **[[simplex category]]** or the **simplicial indexing category**.

* A **simplicial category** is a [[simplicial object]] in [[Cat]] (that is, a functor from $\Delta^{op}$ to $Cat$), just like a simplicial set is a simplicial object in [[Set]], a simplicial space is a simplicial object in [[Top]], a simplicial abelian group is a simplicial object in [[Ab]], and so on.  To avoid ambiguity, **[[simplicial object in Cat|simplicial objects in Cat]]** may be called exactly that.  They may equivalently be regarded as [[internal categories]] in simplicial sets.

* A **simplicial category** also frequently means a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category of [[simplicial sets]], i.e. an [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]].  Such categories can be identified with simplicial objects in [[Cat]] all of whose face and degeneracy morphisms are [[bo functor|bijective on objects]].  To avoid ambiguity, categories enriched over simplicial sets may be called **[[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]]**.
