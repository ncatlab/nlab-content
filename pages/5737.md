## Definition

For $f : X \to Y$ a [[smooth function]], a **critical point** is a point $x \in X$ at which the [[derivative]] $d X : T X \to T Y$ vanishes.

The collection of all critical points is also called the **critical locus** of $f$.

## Applications

* Critical loci are used to study [[topology]] in terms of [[Morse theory]].

* Critical loci of [[functional]]s on [[jet space]]s are studied in [[variational calculus]].
