#Classical Model Structure#

The classical [[model category|model structure]] on simplicial sets has the following distinguished classes of morphisms:

* The **cofibrations** $C$ are simply the [[monomorphism]]s $f : X \to Y$ which are precisely the levelwise injections, i.e. the morphisms of simplicial sets such that $f_n : X_n \to Y_n$ is an injection of sets for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

* The **weak equivalences** $W$ are **weak homotopy equivalences**, i.e., morphisms whose [[simplicial set|geometric realization]] is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces.

It follows from this that

* This model structure is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] by 

  * the set $I$ of generating weak equivalences is the set of boundary inclusions of simplices
    $$
      i_n : \partial \Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]
    $$ 

  * the set $J$ of generating cofibrations is the set of [[horn]] inclusions
    $$
      j^k_n : \Lambda^k[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta^n
      \,.
    $$


* The **fibrations** $F$ are the **[[Kan fibration]]s**, i.e., maps $f : X \to Y$ which have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all [[horn]] inclusions.
  $$
    \array{
      \Lambda^k[n] &\to& X
      \\
      \downarrow &{}^\exists\nearrow& \downarrow^f 
      \\
      \Delta[n] &\to& Y
    }
    \,.
  $$

* All simplicial sets are cofibrant with respect to this model structure. 

* The fibrant objects are precisely the [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]].

###### Theorem

* The **acyclic fibrations** (i.e. the maps that are both fibrations as well as weak equivalences) between [[Kan complex]]es are precisely the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ that have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ of boundaries of $n$-simplices into their $n$-simplices
  $$
    \array{
      \delta \Delta[n] &\to& X
      \\
      \downarrow &{}^\exists\nearrow& \downarrow^f 
      \\
      \Delta[n] &\to& Y
    }
    \,.

Importantly, this model structure is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the [[model structure on topological spaces]] with weak homotopy equivalences as weak equivalences and Serre fibrations as fibrations via the geometric realization and total singular complex functors described [[simplicial set|here]].


## Relation to the model structure on strict $\infty$-groupoids ##

> [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] it would be nice to eventually have a discussion of the following

Recall the [[model structure on strict omega-groupoids]] and the [[omega-nerve]] operation

$$
  N : Str \infty Grpd \to Kan Complx
  \,.
$$

>this ought to be a Quillen functor, but is it? is there a reference?

As a warmup, let $C, D$ be ordinary [[groupoid]]s and $N(C)$, $N(D)$ their ordinary [[nerve]]s. We'd like to show in detail that 

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

A [[functor]] $f : C \to D$ is 

* [[k-surjective functor|essentially k-surjective]] for all $k$ and hence an [[equivalence of categories]] precisely if under the [[nerve]] $N(f) : N(C) \to N(D)$ it induces a weak equivalence of Kan complexes;

* [[k-surjective functor|k-surjective]] for all $k$ and hence a surjective [[equivalence of categories]] precisely if under the [[nerve]] $N(f) : N(C) \to N(D)$ it induces an acyclic fibration of Kan complexes;

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice from the discussion at [[k-surjective functor]] that $f$ being 1- and 2-surjective, i.e. a [[full and faithful functor]] is equivalent to the statement that the diagram

$$
  \array{
    C_1 &\stackrel{f_1 \times f_1}{\to}&
    \\
    \downarrow^{s \times t} &&  \downarrow^{s \times t}
    \\
    C_0 \times C_0
    &\stackrel{f_0 \times f_0}{\to}&
    D_0 \times D_0
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] diagram.

#Joyal's Model Structure#

There is a second model structure on simplicial sets, which is different (not Quillen equivalent) to the classical one, due to Andr&eacute; Joyal, with the following distinguished classes of morphisms:

* The cofibrations $C$ are monomorphisms, equivalently, levelwise injections.

* The weak equivalences $W$ are **weak categorical equivalences**, which are morphisms $u : A \rightarrow B$ of simplicial sets such that the induced map $u^* : X^B \rightarrow X^A$ of internal-homs for all [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] $X$ induces an isomorphism when applying the functor $\tau_0$ that takes a simplicial set to the set of isomorphism classes of objects of its fundamental category.

* The fibrations $F$ are called variously **isofibrations** or **[[Kan fibration|quasi-fibration]]s**. As always, these are determined by the classes $C$ and $W$.
Quasi-fibrations between Kan complexes they have a relatively simple description; they are precisely the maps that have the right lifting property with respect to the inner [[horn] inclusions and also the inclusion $j_0 : * \rightarrow J$ where $*$ is the terminal simplicial set and $J$ is the nerve of the groupoid on two objects with one non-trivial isomorphism. 

All objects are cofibrantly generated. The fibrant objects are precisely the quasi-categories.

This model structure is cofibrantly generated. The generating cofibrations are the set $I$ described above. There is no known explicit description for the generating trivial cofibrations.

Importantly, this model structure is Quillen equivalent to several alternative model structures for the ''homotopy theory of homotopy theories" such as that on the category of [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]].

#Comparison#

Every weak categorical equivalences is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since both model structures have the same cofibrations, it follows that the classical model structure is a [[Bousfield localization]] of Joyal's model structure.
