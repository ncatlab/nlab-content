A $2n$-dimensional topological manifold $M$ is a real __symplectic manifold__ if it has a symplectic atlas; symplectic atlas consists of the charts which are the homeomorphisms $\phi_i:U_i\to M$ jointly covering $M$, such that $U_i\subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and the transition functions $\phi_j^{-1}\circ\phi_i:\phi_i^{-1}(\phi_i(U_i)\cap\phi_j(U_j))\to \phi_j^{-1}(\phi_i(U_i)\cap\phi_j(U_j))$ are diffeomorphisms and preserve the standard symplectic form $\omega_0=\sum_{i=1}^n dx_i\wedge dp_i$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, where $p_i = x_{n+i}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$.  Equivalently, a symplectic manifold is a differentiable manifold equipped with a smooth 2-form $\omega\in \Gamma(\Lambda^2 T^* M)$ which is nondegenerate in the sense that $(\Lambda^2 T^*_p M,\omega_p)$ is a [[symplectic vector space]] for every point $p\in M$.
