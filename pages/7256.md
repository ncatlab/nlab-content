
## Introduction 

In this article, we collect some results about representable functors $C(c, -) \colon C \to V$ ($V$ a base of hom-enrichment) that preserve coproducts. 

When $C$ is an [[extensive category]] regarded as enriched in $Set$, we say that $c$ is a [[connected object]], and this terminology matches well one's intuition about connectedness from familiar cases such as $C = Top$, the category of graphs, etc. Some basic results with proofs may be found at [[connected object]], including 

* A [[connected limit]] (i.e., a limit over a [[connected category|connected diagram]] of) connected objects is connected. 

* If $X$ is connected and $X \to Y$ is epic, then $Y$ is connected. 

For non-extensive categories (e.g., categories of modules), the relation to "connectedness" tends to be less intuitive[^fine]. Nevertheless, the concept of coproduct-preserving representable remains important, and it is useful to collect some basic information. 

## Module categories 

Let $Mod_R$ denote the category of right modules over a ring $R$, and suppose an object $M$ induces a coproduct-preserving hom-functor $Mod_R(M, -) \colon Mod_R \to Ab$. Various names for such $M$ appear in the literature: "compact" and "dually slender" among them. In any event, the [question arose on MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/59282/sums-compact-objects-f-g-objects-in-categories-of-modules) as to whether or to what extent this condition coincides with the condition of being finitely generated, for various rings $R$. 

The information provided below was mostly gleaned from the answers given to that question, especially those by Pierre-Yves Gaillard and Fernando Muro. Here and there some minor details and background information have been filled in, and the results slightly rearranged. 

### Positive results 

We begin with some easy preliminary remarks. Given a family of objects $\{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ in an $Ab$-enriched category $C$ and a functor $F \colon C \to Ab$, there is a canonical arrow 

$$\sum_i F(B_i) \to F(\sum_i B_i)$$ 

and if this arrow is an isomorphism for every family $B_i$, we say $F$ preserves coproducts. Turning to the case of representable functors on modules, let $p_j \colon \oplus_i B_i \to B_j$ to be the obvious projection ($p_j \circ i_j = 1_{B_j}$, else $p_j \circ i_k = 0$), and given $f \colon M \to \oplus_i B_i$, put $f_j \coloneqq p_j \circ f$. Then $Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves the particular coproduct $\oplus_i B_i$ if for each $f \colon M \to \sum_i B_i$, we have $f_j = 0$ for all but finitely many $j$. 

Clearly $Mod_R(R, -)$ preserves coproducts, and if $F$, $G$ are coproduct-preserving functors $Mod_R \to Ab$, then so is $F \oplus G$. It follows that 

* $Mod_R(R^n, -)$ preserves coproducts.

###### Proposition 
If $Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves coproducts and $q \colon M \to N$ is epic, then $Mod_R(N, -)$ preserves coproducts. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Given $f \colon N \to \oplus_i B_i$, we have $p_j \circ f \circ q = 0$ for all but finitely many $j$, whence $f_j = p_j \circ f = 0$ for all but finitely many $j$ since $q$ is epic. 
=--

Combining the two preceding observations, we infer that 

* $Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves coproducts if $M$ is finitely generated. 

Here is a slightly sharper description of coproduct-preserving representables, based on subobject lattices.

###### Proposition 1
{#prop1}
$Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves coproducts if and only if the union of every countable chain of proper submodules of $M$ is a proper submodule.  
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
(As adapted from Gaillard's answer.) Let $M_0\subset M_1\subset\cdots$ be a chain of proper submodules of $M$ whose union is $M$, and put $Q_n = M/M_n$. Then the map 

$$q = \langle q_n \rangle \colon M \to \prod_n Q_n,$$ 

corresponding to the tuple of quotient maps $q_n \colon M \to Q_n$, factors through the inclusion $\oplus_n Q_n \hookrightarrow \prod_n Q_n$. However, since each $q_n$ is nonzero, $q$ does not belong to the subgroup 

$$\oplus_n Mod_R(M, Q_n) \hookrightarrow \prod_n Mod_R(M, Q_n) \cong Mod_R(M, \prod_n Q_n)$$ 

so that the canonical map $\oplus_n Mod_R(M, Q_n) \to Mod_R(M, \oplus_n Q_n)$ is not an isomorphism. 

In the other direction, if $Mod_R(M, -)$ does not preserve coproducts, then we can find some map 

$$f \colon M \oplus_{i\in I} B_i$$ 

not belonging to the subgroup $\oplus_{i \in I} Mod_R(M, B_i) \hookrightarrow Mod_R(M, \oplus_{i \in I} B_i)$. Using notation as above, this means that infinitely many components $f_i \colon M \to B_i$ are nonzero. Choose a countable subset $N \subset I$ such that $f_n \colon M \to B_n$ is nonzero for every $n \in N$, and put 

$$M_n \coloneqq \bigcap_{k \geq n}\ \ker(f_k).$$
 
Each $M_n$ is a proper submodule of $M$, and the $M_n$ form a nondecreasing chain, but the union of the $M_n$ is $M$ (because for each $m \in M$, only finitely many $f_n(m)$ can be nonzero).

###### Theorem 2
{#theorem2}
Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring, and suppose $M \to N$ is a monomorphism of $R$-modules. Then if $Mod_R(N, -)$ is coproduct-preserving, so is $Mod_R(M, -)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
(As adapted from Muro's answer.) Consider a family $B_i$ of modules, and a map $f \colon M \to \oplus_i B_i$. Since there are [enough injectives](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/injective+object#existence_of_enough_injectives_35), there exists an embedding $i_j \colon B_j \to E_j$ in an injective module, for each $j$. 
Next, as explained [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/injective+object#injective_modules_29), the Noetherian assumption allows us to infer that $\oplus_i E_i$ is injective. Thus, there exists $g$ such that the diagram 

$$\array{
M & \to & N \\
 ^\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{g} \\
\oplus_j B_j & \underset{\oplus_j i_j}{\to} & \oplus_j E_j
}$$ 

commutes. Because $Mod_R(N, -)$ preserves coproducts, we have $g_j = 0$ for all but finitely many $j$. Since the diagram 

$$\array{
M & \to & N \\
 ^\mathllap{f_j} \downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{g_j} \\
B_j & \underset{i_j}{\to} & E_j
}$$

commutes and $i_j$ is injective, we see $f_j = 0$ for all but finitely many $j$, whence $Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves coproducts.

###### Corollary 
Let $R$ be Noetherian. If $Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves coproducts, then $M$ is finitely generated. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
(Combining Gaillard's and Muro's answers.) We prove the contrapositive. Suppose $M$ is not finitely generated. Then we can find a strictly increasing sequence of submodules of $M$: 

$$M_1 \hookrightarrow M_2 \hookrightarrow \ldots \hookrightarrow M.$$ 

Let $M'$ be the union of the $M_i$. By [Proposition 1](#prop1), the representable $Mod_R(M', -)$ does not preserve coproducts. By [Theorem 2](#theorem2), we infer that $Mod_R(M, -)$ does not preserve coproducts. 
=-- 

* **Remark:** A ring for which finitely generated modules coincide with modules $M$ such that $Mod_R(M, -)$ is coproduct-preserving is called **steady**. Thus, Noetherian rings are steady. Cf. Martin Brandenburg's answer. 

### Negative results 

Next, we construct an example of a ring $R$ and an $R$-module $M$ such that $Mod_R(M, -)$ preserves coproducts but $M$ is not finitely generated. 

+-- {: .un_lem}
###### Lemma 
A module $M$ is finitely generated if and only if the union of a totally ordered family of proper submodules of $M$ is a proper submodule. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
The following proof is a practically verbatim transcription from Gaillard's answer, modulo some notational changes. Assume that $M$ is not finitely generated. Let $P$ be the set of those submodules $N$ of $M$ such that $M/N$ is not finitely generated, ordered by inclusion. Clearly the poset $P$ is nonempty and has no maximal element. By (the contrapositive of) Zorn's Lemma, there is a nonempty totally ordered subset $T \hookrightarrow P$ which has no upper bound. Letting $U$ be the union of the submodules occurring in $T$, we see that $M/U$ is finitely generated. There is thus a finitely generated submodule $F$ of $M$ which generates $M$ modulo $U$. Then the collection 

$$\{N+F: N \in T\}$$ 

is a totally ordered set of proper submodules whose union is $M$.
=-- 

Thus, our task is to construct a ring $R$ and an $R$-module $M$ such that every _countable_ chain of proper submodules of $M$ is bounded above by a proper submodule of $M$ (cf. [Theorem 2](#theorem2)), but admitting an uncountable chain of proper submodules whose union is $M$ (so that $M$ is not finitely generated, by the preceding lemma). 

The task is more or less straightforward if we just remember that [[valuation ring|valuation rings]] can model arbitrarily complicated [rates of growth](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/valuation+ring#example_rates_of_growth_10), i.e., in the present case, we just want to build a valuation field with uncountable supply of rates of growth (or of degrees of infinite/infinitsimal elements). Thus, consider for example the free abelian group generated by the first uncountable ordinal, and make this a totally ordered group $G$ by imposing the lexicographic order. This is the value group of a valuation field $K$ whose elements are [[Hahn series]], formally described as functions 

$$f \colon G \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

whose support is well-ordered when considered as a subset of the opposite order $G^{op}$. (More suggestively, we think of $f$ as a formal series 

$$\sum_{g \in G} a_g x^g$$ 

where $a_g = f(g)$ and $x$ is an indeterminate viewed as a generic infinite element, with obvious rules for adding and multiplying. The well-ordering condition is used to ensure that the rules for addition and multiplication are well-founded, and the value $v(f)$ of such a series is the least $g \in G^{op}$ lying in the support of $f$. That is to say, the greatest $g \in G$ that indexes a non-zero coefficient $a_g$.) 

Now let $R$ be the valuation ring consisting of _bounded_ elements of $K$, i.e., those $f \colon G \to \mathbb{R}$ in $K$ where $f(g) = 0$ whenever $g$ is greater than the identity element of $G$. Then $K$ is the field of fractions of $R$, and we may regard $K$ as an $R$-module. 

For each $t \in \omega_1$, let $R_t$ be the $R$-submodule of $K$ consisting of all those $f \colon G \to \mathbb{R}$ in $K$ such that $v(f) \leq t$. These $R_t$ are "principal fractional ideals", and they form a system or proper submodules which is cofinal in the lattice of $R$-submodules of $K$, ordered by inclusion. 

By cofinality, any _countable_ chain of submodules of $K$ is bounded above by some $R_t$, so that $Mod_R(K, -)$ preserves coproducts. However, the union of all the $R_t$ is $K$, so that $K$ is not finitely generated. 

[^fine]: The divide between extensive categories and categories of modules is somewhat analogous to the divide between the classical particles and quantum particles.
