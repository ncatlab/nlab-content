The additive envelope of a [[preadditive category]] $A$ is defined by taking the objects as formal direct sums of objects in $A$, and morphisms as matrices of coefficients.  This is a universal construction.

For instance, a [[semisimple category]] is the additive envelope of its full subcategory consisting of simple objects.

  By taking the [[Karoubi envelope]] (i.e. formally adding images of idempotent elements), one constructs a [[Karoubian category]] called the pseudo-abelian envelope of $A$.  
In general, the pseudo-abelian envelope of $A$ is not abelian.
