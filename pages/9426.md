Fermat's curve is a projective algebraic curve over a ground field $k$ given by the Fermat equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer greater or equal $2$. Fermat's last theorem is the theorem, by Andrew Wiles with aid of Richard Taylor, that for $n\gt 2$ this equation has no solutions in rationals (or, equivalently, has no solutions in integers). In other words, the Fermat's curve has no $\mathbf{Q}$-[[rational points]].
