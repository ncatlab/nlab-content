## Introduction 

This page addresses a frequently encountered but easily corrected misconception about [categorial](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/foundation+of+mathematics#CFM) approaches to foundations of mathematics. The misunderstanding is that there is something circular in using a categorial theory like [[ETCS]] (the elementary theory of the category of sets, due to Lawvere) to axiomatize a theory of collections: the argument is that the theory of "categories", which are certain structured collections, calls upon a prior theory of collections in which the notion is situated. 

The most straightforward explanation is that the theory of categories, and of further elaborations like the theory of [[topos|toposes]] and the theory ETCS, are all first-order theories, just as [[ZFC]] is. This is a kind of "formalist" answer, which puts all such theories on an equal logical footing. 
(A more precise formalist answer would compare the strengths of the various theories; for example, ETCS is bi-interpretable and equiconsistent with a form of set theory called BZC (Bounded Zermelo with Choice), a suitable strengthening of [[ETCS]] gives something equiconsistent with [[ZFC]].) 
In any case, all we need to do here is write down a suitable signature that captures all the operations and relations one uses in ETCS, followed by all the usual axioms that hold. While it's clear in principle how to do this, one might as well do it "fully formally", just to settle any lingering doubts created by the above misunderstanding. 

There are various ways one might think of to write down a first-order theory of ETCS, depending to some extent on style and how much one wants to wield [[Occam's razor]]. The choice that a categorical logician might make is likely different from another type of logician might make. In particular, if one is interested not just in the question of "founding mathematics" within [[ETCS]] (where one might prefer an Occam's razor approach as more aesthetically appealing), but also in the question of what sorts of things we want to call "morphisms" between different models of ETCS, then there is less leeway. Here, a categorially appropriate presentation, in particular the one given below, ensures that the logical notion of "homomorphism of models" matches what a categorial logician takes a morphism to be: a functor that preserves finite limits and power objects (up to isomorphism, as usual). Thus, for a categorical logician, it is appropriate to build all the relevant structure (that is to be preserved) directly into the _signature_ of ETCS, using predicates that stand for things like "pullbacks exist", "power objects exist" -- rather than just write these down as axioms. More on this below[^fine]. 

When one carries this plan out, one sees that a large fragment of ETCS is expressed in the form of a [[geometric theory]]. To be precise, a model of ETCS is just a well-pointed topos with a natural numbers object and with Choice; dropping well-pointedness, the theory of toposes with natural numbers object and choice is a geometric theory. The theory of toposes with natural numbers object (which serves as a good foundation for much of [[constructive mathematics]]) is even better: by adjusting the signature in a technically harmless way (that makes morphisms preserve structure strictly instead of only up to isomorphism), it is an [[essentially algebraic theory]] or [[finite limit theory]]. All of these considerations are well-known and significant in categorical logic, clarifying for example the scope of possible categorical interpretations of these theories, but such considerations are likely not too well-known outside of categorial logic circles. 

The precise logical vehicle we use to make these observations (on geometric logic, finite limit logic, etc.) manifest is [[sequent calculus]]. Other frameworks could be chosen, but sequent calculus is standard and well-adapted for defining, in syntactic terms, notions such as "geometric theory", "finite limit theory", etc. For background on this, see Johnstone's [[Elephant]]. 

The fully formal theory ETCS given here is built up in stages: 

* The theory of categories, as a one-sorted theory. (The usual presentation involves two sorts, objects and  morphisms. Our excuse for making it one-sorted is that many introductions to logic do not discuss any except one-sorted theories -- thus these are more familiar to logical novices, the very ones subject to the misconceptions recounted above.) In a morphisms-only approach, we have "source" and "target" operations and a ternary predicate $c(f, g, h)$, meaning "$f$ and $g$ are composable and their composite is $h$". 

* The theory of categories with finite limits. This builds on the previous theory and adds some new predicates, namely an unary predicate $1$ where $1(x)$ means "$x$ is terminal", and a quaternary predicate $p$ where $p(f, g, h, k)$ means "$f$, $g$, $h$, $k$ are the arrows of a pullback square". As indicated above, we add these in as explicit predicates (rather than merely give axioms of existence) so that model homomorphisms are forced to preserve them. 

* The theory of toposes. Here we add in still more predicates to capture the notion of power object up to isomorphism. 

* The theory of toposes with [[natural numbers object]] that are well-pointed (terminal objects are generators) and satisfy AC (every epi has a section).  

The sections below reflect this multi-stage approach. 

## Preliminaries 

We assume familiarity with the standard notion of a [[algebraic theory|(finitary) first-order theory]] with equality; this includes the standard rules of deduction in the Gentzen [[sequent calculus]] for first-order logic[^note2]. 

First-order [[theory|theories]] are typically presented in terms of a [[signature]] consisting of function and predicate symbols, together with axioms each of which is a closed formula in the first-order language generated by the signature. That mode of presentation will be followed here. Standard logical conventions are followed; for example, it is common to state axioms as formulas $P(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ in which some of the variables $x_i$ may appear freely, with the implicit understanding that such variables are bound by unwritten [[universal quantifiers]] at the heads of formulas, to make the formulas closed. 

To make the exposition more readable, we add some explanations (in parentheses) which do not belong to the formal theory, but which may aid comprehension. We also employ the standard device of abbreviating formulas, by declaring at various junctures definitions and notational conventions. 

In formalizing universal properties, one very helpful purely logical abbreviation is the "exists-unique" quantifier $\exists !$. Namely, if $Q(x)$ is a formula in which a variable $x$ appears freely, then $\exists ! x: Q(x)$ is shorthand for the conjunction of 

$$(\exists_x Q(x))$$ \wedge 

$$\,$$

$$Q(x) = Q(y) \vdash x = y$$

## The theory of categories 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

We define the [[theory]] $Th(Cat)$ of [[categories]].

The [[signature]] of $Th(Cat)$ consists of 

* Unary function symbols $s$, $t$; 

* A ternary predicate $c$. 

(The [[theory]] of [[categories]] is commonly presented as a two-sorted theory, with an object sort and a morphism sort. Here we instead use [[single-sorted definition of a category|the single-sorted theory]], whose terms are to be interpreted as _morphisms_ of a category. We generally use letters $f, g, h, \ldots$ for variable terms. If $e$ is any term, then the intended interpretation of $s(e)$ is: the identity morphism of the domain of $e$. Similarly, $t(e)$ means the identity morphism of the codomain of $e$. The intended interpretation of $c(f, g, h)$ is that $h = f \circ g$.) 

The axioms of $Th(Cat)$ are as follows:  

1. $\vdash (s s(f) = s(f) = t s (f)) \wedge (t t(f) = t(f) = s t(f))$. 

1. $c(f, g, h) \vdash (s(f) = t(g) \wedge t(f) = t(h) \wedge s(g) = s(h))$

1. $s(f) = t(g) \vdash \exists !_h c(f, g, h)$

1. ([[identity|Identity]] laws) $\vdash c(f, s(f), f) \wedge c(t(f), f, f)$

1. ([[associativity|Associativity]]) $(c(f, g, j) \wedge c(g, h, k)) \vdash (c(j, h, m) \Leftrightarrow c(f, k, m))$

(Notice that an **object-term** may be defined as a term $e$ for which either of the following equivalent equations holds: $e = s(e)$, $e = t(e)$.)

## The theory of finitely complete categories

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

We define the [[theory]] $Th(Lex)$ of [[finitely complete categories]].

(The axioms say there is a [[terminal object]] $1$, and a [[pullback]] for each pair $f, g$ with common target.) 

The axioms of $Th(Lex)$ are the axioms of $Th(Cat)$ plus the following: 

1. $\exists_1 (1 = s(1)) \wedge (\forall_f (f = s(f)) \Rightarrow 
(\exists ! g: (s(g) = f \wedge t(g) = 1))$

1. (Pullbacks exist) Define $p(f, g, h, k)$ to be the conjunction of the formulas  
$$(\exists_j c(f, h, j) \wedge c(g, k, j))$$
$$\,$$
$$(\exists_{j'} (c(f, h', j') \wedge c(g, k', j')) \Rightarrow (\exists ! i: (c(h, i, h') \wedge c(k, i, k')))$$ 
Then   
$$t(f) = t(g) \vdash \exists_h \exists_k p(f, g, h, k)$$

## The theory of elementary toposes 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

We define the [[theory]] $Th(Topos)$ of [[elementary toposes]].

The signature of $Th(Topos)$ is obtained by adding to the signature of $Th(Lex)$ unary function symbols $P, \lambda, \rho$. 

(The intended interpretation is that $P(f: X \to Y)$ is the [[power object]] of $Y$, and $\langle \lambda(Y), \rho(Y) \rangle: E(Y) \hookrightarrow P(Y) \times Y$ is the elementhood relation, which we rewrite as a jointly [[monomorphism|monic]] [[span]], and consider as a [[universal property|universal]] relation from $P(Y)$ to $Y$.) 

The axioms of $Th(Topos)$ are obtained by adjoining to $Th(Lex)$ the following further axioms. In what follows, $M(f, g)$ denote the following formula in $Th(Cat)$:

$$s(f) = s(g) \wedge (\forall_{h, i, j, k} (c(f, h, j) \wedge c(f, i, j) \wedge c(g, h, k) \wedge c(g, i, k)) \Rightarrow h = i)$$

($M(f, g)$ means that the pair $(f, g)$ is a jointly monic span, aka a relation. In other words, that $\langle f, g \rangle \colon s(f) \to t(f) \times t(g)$ is monic, and $(f, g)$ form a relation between $t(f)$ and $t(g)$.) 

1. ($P(f: X \to Y) = P(Y)$ is an object that depends only on the codomain of $f$, and $\lambda(f), \rho$ are morphisms that span between $P(Y)$ and $Y$, comprising a local elementhood relation) 
$$\vdash (P(f) = P(t(f)) = t(P(f)) = t(\lambda(f))) \wedge (t(\rho(f)) = t(f))$$ 

1. $\vdash M(\lambda(f), \rho(f))$

1. (Universal property of power objects) 
$$M(f, g) \vdash \exists ! h: \exists_k p(h, \lambda(f), g, k) \wedge c(\rho(f), k, f)$$

## The theory ETCS 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Finally, we define the [[theory]] $Th(ETCS)$: [[ETCS]].

The signature of $Th(ETCS)$ is obtained by adjoining to the signature of $Th(Topos)$ the following 

* Nullary function symbols (i.e., constants) $\mathbb{N}, 0, \sigma$. 

The axioms of $Th(ETCS)$ are obtained by adjoining to the axioms of $Th(Topos)$ the following further axioms: 

1. ([[well-pointed topos|Well-pointedness]]: equality of maps $x \to y$ is detected by points $1 \to x$) 
$$(s(f) = s(g) \wedge t(f) = t(g)) \vdash \forall_h (s(h) = 1 \wedge t(h) = s(f) \Rightarrow f \circ h = g \circ h) \Rightarrow f = g$$ 

1. ([[axiom of choice|Axiom of Choice]]: every epi $f$ admits a section $i$) 
$$(\forall_{g, h} (t(f) = s(g) = s(h) \;\wedge\; t(g) = t(h) \;\wedge\; g \circ f = h \circ f) \;\Rightarrow\; g = h) \vdash \exists_i (s(i) = t(f) \;\wedge\; t(i) = s(f) \;\wedge\; f \circ i = t(f))$$

1. ([[natural numbers object|Zero and successor]])
$$\vdash s(0) = 1 \wedge t(0) = \mathbb{N} = s(\sigma) = t(\sigma)$$

1. ([[natural numbers object|Recursion: existence]]) 
$$s(f) = 1 \wedge t(f) = s(g) = t(g) \vdash \exists_h (s(h) = \mathbb{N} \wedge t(h) = t(f) \wedge f = h \circ 0 \wedge h \circ \sigma = g \circ h)$$ 

1. (Recursion: uniqueness) 
$$(s(f) = \mathbb{N} = s(g) \wedge t(f) = t(g) \wedge f \circ 0 = g \circ 0 \wedge f \circ \sigma = g \circ \sigma) \vdash f = g$$


This completes the formal specification of $Th(ETCS)$.

## Remarks 

### On $Th(Cat)$ 

The theory of categories is usually presented as a two-sorted theory, where the sorts $O$ and $M$ are for objects and morphisms. 

Despite the length of the list of axioms, it should be noted that they generally have an extremely simple logical structure. Indeed, with some slight modification, the theory $Th(Topos)$ may be rewritten so that it becomes an [[essentially algebraic theory]], at least in the sense that the models of $Th(Topos)$ are categorially equivalent (as categories = models of $Th(Cat)$) to models of an essentially algebraic theory. That is to say, the notion of "topos" can be [[internalization|internalized]] in any category with finite limits; this is even true of toposes with natural numbers object. 

Hence, the only "irremovable" existential clauses (that necessitate passing from essentially algebraic logic to a larger fragment of first-order logic) are well-pointedness and the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice belongs to [[geometric logic]]. 

This is in marked contrast to ZFC, whose axiom list is superficially shorter (ignoring the fact that axiom schemas are technically infinite lists of axioms!) but whose logical complexity is much greater. 

It must be added that this fully formal presentation masks much of the conceptual clarity afforded by the underlying categorical and structural insights that are actually at work, particularly the systematic use of universal mapping properties. To put it more sharply: the traditional syntactic machinery used to present first-order theories is not really a natural or well-adapted 'home' for presenting categorical theories such as ETCS. The natural mode of presentation would use diagrams of arrows from the outset, as formalized say by Freyd's [[Q-sequence]]s, and that is as fully formal as the more traditional mode adopted here, which after all goes back to Frege and hasn't changed in a century.


## References

Over the years various people at 

* _Foundations of Mathematics_ [mailing list](http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/) (around 1998)
{#FOM}

have challenged [[category theory|category theorists]] to write down a fully formal presentation of ETCS. 

[note1]: Note how cumbersome are the traditional "machine-level" logical scripts for expressing this theory, as opposed to the more visual and easily apprehended arrow-theoretic notations (which are just as rigorous). No doubt this was anticipated by those in the FOM debate who wished to portray categorical foundations in the worst possible light: traditional 1-dimensional logical notations tend to make the theory look as clumsy as possible! 

[note2]: We use $\vdash$ to denote an entailment between formulas; axioms of our theory are written in the form $\Gamma \dash P$ where $\Gamma$ is a finite, possibly empty list of formulas which provide the _context_ in which $P$ is asserted. Obviously one could eschew this symbol entirely, and instead give each axiom in the form of a single formula with appropriately embedded implication symbols $\Rightarrow$. But, as explained in this article, this would obscure the later point that large fragments of ETCS, in fact all axioms except well-pointedness, are manifestly expressible in _coherent logic_.
