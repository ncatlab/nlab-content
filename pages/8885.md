## Idea

The _Fraenkel model_ is a model of the [[set theory]] [[ZFA]], which doesn't satisfy the [[axiom of choice]]. It was the first example of a [[permutation model]] of set theory.

## Description

Fraenkel's description, and indeed most set theorists would give the description of the Fraenkel model using the language of [[material set theory]], but it can be described quite simply from a [[structural set theory|structural]] perspective, and then the original version can be recovered by considering [[pure sets]] (allowing [[urelement|atoms]]).

The model is given by the [[topos]] of [[sets]] with an [[action]] of an open sub[[group]] of $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^\mathbb{N}$ for a certain [[topology]] on this group. Open subgroups are the finite-[[index]] subgroups $\prod_{i\in I} H_i\times (\mathbb{Z}/2)^{(\mathbb{N} - I)}$ for finite $I\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $H_i \le \mathbb{Z}/2$. Arrows in this topos are allowed to be equivariant for an open (possibly proper) subgroup of the groups acting on the domain and codomain.
