## Idea ##


Čech cohomology is the [[cohomology]] theory of the [[(infinity,1)-topos]] of [[infinity-stack]] that are [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category|localized]] not with respect to all [[hypercovers]] but only with respect to all [[Čech covers]].

The former is the [[hypercompletion]] of the Čech model, which for instance includes ordinary [[abelian sheaf cohomology]].
Traditionally this is what what people were interested in. From the point of view of the [[hypercompletion]]
Čech cohomology is more an algorithm for computing hypercohomology in special cases (see [[Čech methods]]) than 
a cohomology theory in itself.

On the other hand, in section 6.5.4 of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] it is argued that Čech cohomology is the better behaved cohomology theory after all (see references below).

From the discussion at [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] we know that the right derived functor definition computes the hom-set in the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ that may alternatively be computed as a colimit over resolutions of the domain object

$$
  H(X,A)
  := 
  \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X,A)
  = colim_{Y \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} X} 
  C_H(Y,A)/_{homotopy}
$$

where the colimit is over all acyclic fibrations $Y \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} X$ in an appropriate [[model category]] $C_H$ that [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] $\mathbf{H}$. For $\mathbf{H}$ an [[infinity-stack]] [[(infinity,1)-topos]] this $C_H$ is a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and the acyclic fibrations $Y \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} X$ for $X$ an ordinary space are the [[hypercovers]].

Now, for some coefficient objects $A$ it is sufficient to take the colimit here not over all [[hypercovers]], but just over [[Čech covers]]. The resulting formula

$$
  H(X,A)
  = colim_{Y \stackrel{\mathop{&#x010C;ech} cover}{\to} X} 
  C_H(Y,A)/_{homotopy}
$$

is then called the formula for **Čech cohomology** on $X$ with values in $A$.

Here a [[Čech cover]] is a simplicial presheaf that arises from an ordinary covering map $U \to X$ of $X$ by another space $U$ as the corresponding [[Čech nerve]] simplicial presheaf

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  Y := \left( 
    \cdots
    U \times_X U \times_X U
    \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
    U \times_X U \stackrel{\to}{\to} U 
  \right)
  \simeq
  hocolim_{[k] \in \Delta} U^{\times_X k}
 \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

See [[descent for simplicial presheaves]] for more on the manipulations involved here.

To amplify, a general [[hypercover]] would start in degree 0 with a $U$ as above, but then in the next degree would have a cover $V \to U \times_X U$ of the fiber product, and so on, each fiber product in turn being covered by another space.

If $Y$ is not simply a [[Čech cover]] but also not the most general [[hypercover]] in that this iterative choice of further covering stops in degree $n$, then one also speaks of **Čech cover of level $n$** and of the corresponding cohomology formula as **higher Čech cohomology**. See for instance the reference by Tibor Beke below.



## General ("nonabelian") Čech cohomology ##

We start with describing the general " _nonabelian_ " Čech cohomology (compare the terminology and remarks at [[cohomology]] and [[nonabelian cohomology]]), i.e. the plain unwrapping of the above definition, before assuming that our coefficient object is [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian]] and before applying the [[Moore complex]] functor that sends the following simplicial computation to the maybe more familiar one in [[chain complexes]].

The reasoning parallels that described at [[descent]] to some extent, but is maybe still worthwhile repeating here.

So let $C$ be some [[site]] and let $SSh(C)$ the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial (pre)sheaves]] on $C$. Let $C(U)$ be the Čech nerve for a cover $\pi : U \to X$ of some simplicial presheaf $X$ and let $A$ be any other simplicial presheaf that serves as the coefficient object.

Using [[end]] and [[coend]] notation we compute the required hom

$$
 \begin{aligned}
    SSh(C(U), A)
    &
    \simeq
    SSh( \int^{[k] \in Delta} \Delta^k \cdot C(U)_k, A )
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    \int_{[k] \in Delta} SSh(\Delta^k \cdot C(U)_k, A )   
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    \int_{[k] \in Delta} SSet(\Delta^k , SSh(C(U)_k,A) )   
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    \int_{[k] \in Delta} SSet(\Delta^k , A(U \times_X \cdots \times_X U) )   
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    \int_{[k] \in Delta} SSet(\Delta^k , \prod_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} A(U_{i_0 i_1, \cdots ,i_k}) )   
 \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here in the last line we have assumed that $U = \sqcup_i U_i$ for $\{U_i \to X\}$ an open cover of some space $X$ and we abbreviate as usual with
$
  U_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_k}
$ the $(k+1)$-fold intersections 
$\cap_{0 \leq r \leq k} U_{i_r}$.

An object in this last expression -- an $A$-valued cocycle on $X$ relative to $U$ -- is a collection of morphisms in [[SSet]] of the form

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    \Delta^2
    &\stackrel{f}{\to}&
    \prod_{i j k} A(U_{i j k})
    \\
    \Delta^1
    &\stackrel{g}{\to}&
    \prod_{i j}A(U_{ i j})
    \\
    \Delta^0
    &\stackrel{a}{\to}&
    \prod_i A(U_i)
  }
  \right)
$$

that make all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    \uparrow
    &&
    \uparrow
    \\
    \Delta^2
    &\stackrel{f}{\to}&
    \prod_{i j k} A(U_{i j k})
    \\
    \uparrow
    &&
    \uparrow
    \\
    \Delta^1
    &\stackrel{g}{\to}&
    \prod_{i j}A(U_{ i j})
    \\
    \uparrow^{\delta_{\cdot}}
    &&
    \uparrow^{A(d_{C(U)})_\cdot}
    \\
    \Delta^0
    &\stackrel{a}{\to}&
    \prod_i A(U_i)
  }
$$

commute. Here the vertical morphism on the right, when one traces their origin through the derivation above, are the various inclusion and restriction maps of elements of $A$ evaluated on a $k$-fold intersection to some other intersection.

For instance the three possible vertical maps at the
bottom have components on the cartesian factors given by

$$
  A(d_1)|_{U_i} := (-)|_{U_{i j}}
  :
  A(U_i)  
  \to 
  A(U_{i j})
$$

and

$$
  A(d_0)|_{U_i} := (-)|_{U_{i j}}
  :
  A(U_j)  
  \to 
  A(U_{i j})
$$

and 

$$
  A(s_0)|_{U_{i i}}
  :
  A(U_{i i})  
  \to 
  A(U_{i })
  \,.
$$


This picks

* an object $a \in A(U)$

* a morphism $g : \pi_1 ^* a \to \pi_2^* a in A(U \times_X U)$

* a 2-morphism 
  $$ 
    \array{
      && \pi_{2}^* a
      \\
      & {}^{\pi_{12}^* g}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{f}& \searrow^{\pi_{23}^* g}
      \\
      \pi_{1}^* a
      &&\stackrel{\pi_{13}^* g}{\to}&&
      \pi_3^* a
    }
  $$
  in $A(U \times_X U \times_X U)$

* etc.

If we follow tradition and write 

* $U = \sqcup_i U_i$;

* and $U \times_X U = \sqcup_{i j} U_{i j} := \sqcup_{i j} U_i \cap U_j$

* etc

this is

* an collection of objects $(a_i \in A(U_i))$

* a collection of morphisms 
  $(g_{i j} : a_i|_{U_{ij}} \to a_{j}|_{U_{i j}} 
  in A(U_{i j}))$

* a collection of 2-morphisms 
  $$ 
   \left(
    \array{
      && a_{j}|_{U_{i j k}}
      \\
      & {}^{g_{ij}|_{U_{i j k}}}\nearrow 
      &\Downarrow^{f_{i j k}}& 
       \searrow^{g_{j k}|_{U_{i j k}}}
      \\
      a_i|_{U_{i j k}}      
       &&\stackrel{g_{i k}|_{U_{i j k}}}{\to}&&
      a_k|_{U_{i j k}}
    }
   \right)
  $$
  in $A(U_{i j k})$

* etc.

This is a **Čech-cocycle** on $X$ with values in $A$ relative to $U$.

A **transformation/homotopy/coboundary** between two such cocycles is a cylinder over these diagrams, i.e. 

* a collection of morphism
  $ h_i : a_i  \to a'_i  in A(U_i)$;

* a collection of 2-morphism

We now plug in some concrete coefficient object 
$n$-types for low $n$ and reproduce some concrete formulas
from this.

### Nonabelian 1-cocycles: principal bundles ###

For $G$ a [[group]] let 
$\mathbf{B} G$ by abuse of notation denote 

* first of all the corresponding
[[delooping|delooped]] [[groupoid]], 

* then the corresponding [[nerve]] 

* then finally the corresponding simplicial sheaf that for each object $U$ assigns the [[nerve]] for the group $Hom(U,G)$:

  $$
    \mathbf{B}G : U \mapsto
    \left\{
      \array{
        \mathbf{B}G(U)_0 = Hom(U,{*}) = {*}
        \\
        \mathbf{B}G(U)_1 = Hom(U,G)
        \\
        \mathbf{B}G(U)_2 = Hom(U,G)\times Hom(U,G)
        \\
        \vdots
      }     
    \right.
  $$

The above then says that 

* a $\mathbf{B}G$-Čech cocycle is

  * a collection of $G$-valued functions 

     $$
       (g_{ij} \in Hom(U_{i j}, G))
     $$
  
  * a collection of identities between $G$-valued functions

    $$
      g_{ij}|_{U_{i j k }} 
       \cdot
      g_{j k}|_{U_{i j k }}
      =
      g_{i k}|_{U_{i j k }}
    $$

* a $\mathbf{B}G$-Čech coboundary is
  
  * a collection of $G$-valued functions

    $$
      (h_i \in Hom(U_i , G))
    $$

  * a collection of identites between $G$-valued functions

    $$
      g_{ij} \cdot h_j|_{U_{i j}}
      = 
      h_i|_{U_{i j}} \cdot g'_{j k}
      \,.
    $$

Remembering that the Čech cohomology is the colimit over refinement of covers over cohomology classes defined this way, one sees the standard

###### Theorem

Čech cohomology with coefficients in $\mathbf{B}G$
(as above) classies $G$-[[principal bundles]]

$$

### Nonabelian 2-cocycles: gerbes and principal 2-bundles ###


In one degree higher the general [[homotopy n-type|homotopy 2-type]] coefficient object is modeled using a strict [[2-group]] $H$ coming from a [[crossed module]]
$G_2 \stackrel{\delta}{\to} G_1$.

The [[nerve]] of the corresponding [[delooping|delooped]]
[[2-groupoid]], regarded immediately as a simplicial sheaf starts out like

$$
  \mathbf{B}(G_2 \to G_1)
  :
  U 
  \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbf{B}(G_2 \to G_1)(U)_{0}
       = 
       Hom(U, G_1)
       \\
       \mathbf{B}(G_2 \to G_1)(U)_{1}
       = 
       Hom(U, G_1) \times Hom(U, G_1)
       \times Hom(U, G_2)
       \\
       \vdots
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

One finds that a Čech-cocycle now is
(see also the diagrams at [[group cohomology]] for this)

* a collection of functions 

  $$
    (g_{i j} \in Hom(U_{i j}, G_1))
  $$

* a collection of functions
  
  $$
    (f_{i j k }\in Hom(U_{i j k}, G_2) )
  $$

* a collection of identities  

  $$
    \delta(f_{i j k}|_{U_{i j k}})
    g_{i j}|_{U_{i j k}}
    g_{j k}|_{U_{i j k}}
    =
    g_{i k}|_{U_{i j k}}  
  $$

* and a collection of identities

  $$
    f_{i k l}|_{U_{i j k l}}
    \cdot
    f_{i j k}|_{U_{i j k l}}
    =
f_{i j l}|_{U_{i j k l}}
\cdot
    \alpha(g_{i j}|_{U_{i j k l}})(f_{j k l}|_{U_{i j k l}}),
    $$
where $\alpha:G_1\to Aut(G_2)$ is the homomorphism associated with the crossed-module description of the 2-group.

This is a **nonabelian Čech 2-cocycle**.

Reading off the formulas for the coboundaries is
left as an excercise for the reader.

For the specical case the 

$$
  (G_2 \to G_1) = (G \to Aut(G))
$$

this is the nonabelian cohomology classifying
[[gerbes]].


## Abelian Čech cohomology ##

In much of the literature _Čech cohomology_ denotes exclusively the abelian case, which we now describe.

In the special case that the coefficient [[simplicial presheaf]] $A$ is in the image of the [[nerve]] operation 

$$
  N : Ch_+ \to sAb \to SSet
$$

on [[chain complexes]] with values in [[simplicial sets]] that happen to be abelian [[simplicial groups]], the computation of Čech cocycles may be entirely pulled back to the world of [[homological algebra]] by making use of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] that provides an [[adjoint equivalence]] between simplicial sets with values in abelian groups and non-negatively graded chain complexes.

**Remark** The following derivation of abelian Čech cohomology from nonabelian Čech cohomology restricted to nerves of chain complexes needs of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] only that it is an [[adjunction]], not that it is an [[adjoint equivalence]]. 

The following structure arises, 
when one computes Čech cohomology in this context,
as shown below.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Čech complex

Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a collection of open subsets
of $X$
and let $A_\bullet$ be a sheaf with coefficients
in non-negatively graded chain complexes $Ch_+$.

Then define the **Čech chain complex** $C(U,A_\bullet)$ 
of $A_\bullet$ relative to $U$ by

$$
  C(U,A_\bullet)_k :=
  \oplus_{k = l-n}
  \prod_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n}
  A_l(U_{i_1, \cdots, i_n})
$$

where $U_{i_1, \cdots, i_n} = U_{i_0} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_n}$ if all indices are pairwise different, and empty otherwise, and
with differential given by

$$
  (d a)_{i_0, \cdots, i_n} = 
  d_A a_{i_0, \cdots, i_n}
  +
  (-1)^n
  \sum_{0 \leq j \leq n} (-1)^{j}
  a_{i_0, \cdots, i_{j-1}, i_{j+1}, \cdots, i_n} 
  |_{U_{i_0, \cdots, i_n}}
$$

where on the right we sum over all components of $a$ obtained by discarding one of the original $(n+1)$ subscripts.

=--

**Remark** When $A_\bullet$ is not concentrated in a single degree, the above is often called the **Čech hypercomplex** and its cohomology is called **Čech hypercohomology**.


As the following derivation will show, this complex encodes a linearization of the simplicial nonabelian cocycle depicted above. It may be helpful to keep the following pictures in mind to match the signs to the orientations of simplices.

In dimension one we have:

$$
  (0 \to 1)
  \;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;
  (a_0 \stackrel{a_{0 1}}{\to} a_1)
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  (a_1 = a_0 + d_A a_{01})
$$

In dimension 2 we have:

$$
  \array{
    && 1
    \\
    & \nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow
    \\
    0 &&\to&& 2
  }
  \;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \array{
    && a_1
    \\
    & {}^{a_{0 1}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{a_{0 1 2}}
    & \searrow^{a_{1 2}}
    \\
    a_0 &&\stackrel{a_{0 2}}{\to}&& a_2
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  (a_{0 2} = a_{0 1} + a_{1 2} + d a_{0 1 2})
  \,.
$$

Here the relation on the right is the 
[[Dold-Kan correspondence]] relating coboundaries in the
complex $A_\bullet$ to simplices .


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition (abelian Čech cohomology)

Let $A_\bullet$ be a sheaf with values in $Ch_+$
and write $N(A_\bullet)$ for the corresponding
simplicial sheaf under the [[nerve]] operation
of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].

Then the general (nonabelian) Čech cohomology
of $N(A_\bullet)$ as defined above coincides
with the cohomology of the Čech complex of
$A_\bullet$:

$$
  H(X, N(A_\bullet))
  \simeq
  colim_U H_0(C(U,A_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The underlying idea is to use the 
adjunction of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]
to move the nerve operation $N(A_\bullet)$ 
on the right to the
free abelian chain complex operation 
$C_bullet(F(C(U)))$
on the 
[[Čech cover]] simplicial sheaf $C(U)$ and then 
use the [[Yoneda lemma]] to evaluate $A_\bullet$
on $N_\bullet(F(C(U)))$. The result is the 
Čech complex of $A_\bullet$. 
Cocycles and homotopies/coboundaries
are in bijection on both sides.

Spelled out in full detail this looks a bit more lengthy,
but is nothing but this simple idea.

Before starting the computation notice the following
observation on the image of the [[Čech cover]]
$C(U)$ under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]:

For $Y = C(U)$ a [[Čech cover]] on a sieve 
$\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$, and for $W$ any test object,
the non-degenerate $n$-simplices in $C(U)(W)$ are the

$$
  U_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n}(W)
$$ 

with all indices pairwise different, $i_k \neq i_l$. 

Accordingly the free abelian simplicial group-valued
sheaf $F(C(U))$ is for each $W$ and $n$ the 
free abelian group generated from these 
$U_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n}(W)$ with pairwise distinct elements, i.e. that given by
formal interger combinations of these element.

In turn, the normalized [[Moore complex]] sheaf

$$
  N_\bullet(F(C(U))) 
$$

assigns to a test domain $W$ the complex that in
each degree is the free abelian group on these 
elements.



With this in hand,
we compute the set of $N(A_\bullet)$-valued cocycles on $U$ as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}

* The first step is the definition of morphism of [[presheaf|presheaves]] using the [[end]] notation;

* the second step is the definition of the [[nerve]] of of [[chain complexes]] applied to chain complex valued sheaves;

* the third step uses that the free simplicial abelian group functor is [[left adjoint]] to the forgetful one that remembers the underlying simplicial set;

* the fourth step then uses the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], or actually just that the normalized [[Moore complex]] functor is [[left adjoint]] to the [[nerve]] of [[chain complexes]];

* the fifth step expresses the set of morphisms of [[chain complexes]] as an [[end]] (being itself a [[natural transformation]]);

* the sixth step uses the [[Fubini theorem]] of [[enriched category theory]] to commute the two [[ends]];

* the seventh step uses that the chain complex in the left argument is generated freely on elements of a set to rewrite the hom of abelian groups into one of sets;

* this finally allows to apply the [[Yoneda lemma]] in step eight

* and in step nine, by inspection, one notices that the result thus obtained is the set of 0-cycles in the Čech complex $C(U,A_\bullet)$ as previously defined.

An entirely analogous argument shows that dividing out homotopies is respected. 

One starts by observing that the cohomology coboundaries are given by homotopies in the hom-simplicial set, i.e. by

$$
  Hom_{SPSh}(C(U) \times \Delta^1, N(A_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

With this one goes in the above computation.
After applying the 
[[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan adjunction]]
we now have on the left in the integrand the term

$$
  N_\bullet(F(C(U)(W) \times \Delta^1))
  \,.
$$

Using first that the free simplicial group functor is monoidal and then that the normalized [[Moore complex]]
functor is lax monoidal (as described at 
[[Dold-Kan correspondence]])

> what to do about laxness versus pseudoness??

we get a morphism to that from 

$$
  N_\bullet(F(C(U)(W))) \otimes  N_\bullet(F(\Delta^1))
  \,.
$$

Using that the normalized Moore complex is 
isomorphic to the Moore complex divided by the part
generated by degenerate cells, 
on the right we identify the [[interval object]] complex

$$
   (  \cdots \to 0 \to I  \stackrel{1 \oplus -1}{\to} I \oplus I)
  \,.
$$

To see that one just needs to observe that the normalized [[Moore complex]] of the 1-[[simplex]] serves as an [[interval object]] in chain complexes.

### Relation of abelian Čech cohomology to abelian sheaf cohomology ###

For $A$ a complex of sheaves, there is a canonical morphism

$$
  \check{H}(X,A) \to H(X,A)
$$

from the Čech cohomology to the full (hypercompleted) cohomology, which is [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] in the case that $A$ is in the image of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan map]] from [[chain complexes]]. Using the description of abelian sheaf cohomology in terms of morphisms out of hypercovers described at the beginning of this entry, this morphism is the obvious one coming from the inclusion of [[Čech covers]] into all [[hypercovers]].

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

If $X$ is a [[paracompact space]] the canonical morphism

$$
  \check{H}(X,A) \to H(X,A)
$$

from Čech cohomology to [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] is an isomorphism from every $A \in Sh(X, Ch_+)$.

###### Proof

* Brylinski, _Loop spaces, characteristic classes and geometric quantization_

When $X$ is not paracompact, we still have the following condition under which Čech cohomology computes [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]-.


For $A$ a complex of sheaves, there is a canonical morphism

$$
  H_0(C(U,A)_\bullet) \to H(X,A)
$$

from the cohomology of the Čech complex with respect to a cover $U$ with coefficients in $A$ to the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of $X$ with values in $A$. Using the description of abelian sheaf cohomology in terms of morphisms out of hypercovers described at the beginning of this entry, this morphism is the obvious one coming from the inclusion of [[Čech covers]] into all [[hypercovers]].

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

Let $A$ be a complex of sheaves on $X$ concentrated
in a single degree $p \geq 0$, 
and let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a [[cover]]
such that the $A$-cohomology of all intersections vanishes, 

$$
 \forall U_{i_0 , \cdots, i_k} H(U_{i_0, \cdots, i_k},A) = 0
$$

Then the canonical morphism

$$
  H_0(C(U,A)_\bullet) \to H(X,A)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

=--

###### Proof

One considers the spectral sequence associated with the Čech double complex. Details are on page 28 of

* Brylinski, _Loop spaces, characteristic classes and geometric quantization_

### Examples ###

We now list examples for abelian Čech cohomology expressed in terms of the Čech complex described above.



#### Line bundles ####

Let $G = U(1)$ be the circle group, an abelian
group. The [[nerve]] $N(\mathbf{B}G)$ 
of its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ is the 
[[bar construction]] of $G$. This is equivalently
the nerve of the [[chain complex]] 

$$
  U(1)[1]
  := ( \cdots \to 0 \to U(1) \to 0 )
  \,.
$$

Equivalently we get the corresponding simplicial sheaves
and complexes of sheaves, eg

$$
  U(1)[1] : W \mapsto 
  ( \cdots \to 0 \to Hom(W,U(1)) \to 0 )
  \,.
$$

So given a cover $\{U_i \to X\}$ a Čech cocycle is a collection

$$
  c = ( \{g_{i j} \in U(1)[1](U_{i j})\}|_{i,j})
$$

such that the Čech differential evaluated on it

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (d_{C(U,U(1)[1])} c)_{i j k}
    &=
    g_{j k}|_{U_{i j k}} - g_{i k}|_{U_{i j k}} 
    + g_{i j}|_{U_{i j k}} )
  \end{aligned}
$$

vanishes:

$$
  g_{i j}|_{U_{i j k}} + g_{j k}|_{U_{i j k}} = g_{i k}|_{U_{i j k}}
$$

for all $i, j, k$.

Here now we write plus signs for the operation in the abelian group $U(1)$ which above we have written by juxtaposition or using a dot. So up to notation for the group operation this is

$$
  g_{i j} g_{j k} = g_{i k}
$$

on $U_{i j k}$ as before in the nonabelian case of
Čech cocycles for
$U(1)$-[[principal bundles]].

Here and from now on we shall notationally suppress the restriction maps $(-)|_{U_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n}}$
as they are unambiguously obviuous in every case.


#### Line bundle gerbes ####

Similarly by shifting $U(1)$ ever higher in chain degree,
one finds Čech cocycles for [[bundle gerbes]], bundle 2-gerbes, etc.

A Čech cocycle for 

$$
  U(1)[2]
  := ( \cdots \to 0 \to U(1) \to 0 \to 0 )
  \,.
$$

is 

$$
  c = ( \{g_{i j k} \in U(1)[2](U_{i j k})\}|_{i,j, k})
$$

such that on $U_{i,j,k,l}$ we have

$$
  g_{i j k} - g_{i j l} + g_{i k l} - g_{j k l} = 0
$$

which in the nonabelian context would be written as

$$
  g_{i j k} g_{i k l} = g_{i j l} g_{j k l}
  \,.
$$



#### Čech-Deligne cohomology ####

When refining the complexes of sheaves $U(1)[n]$
to the [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne complex]]

$$
  U(1)[n] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}(n+1)_D^\infty
$$

and then evaluating Čech cohomology with coefficients
in the Deligne complex, we obtain the formulas for
Čech-Deligne cohomology.



* For $n = 1$ a cocycle is a collection
  $$
    ( A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i), 
      g_{i j} \in C^\infty(U_{i j}, U(1)) )
  $$
  such that for all $i, j$
  $$
    d log g_{i j} + A_i - A_j -  = 0
  $$
  and for all $i,j ,k$
  $$
    g_{i j} g_{j k} = g_{i k} 
    \,.
  $$
  Such cocycles classify $U(1)$-[[principal bundles]]
  with [[connection on a bundle|connection]].

  These $n=1$ Čech-Deligne cocycles appear naturally in the study of the [[electromagnetic field]].

* For $n = 2$ a cocycle is a collection
  $$
    ( B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i), 
      A_{i j} \in \Omega^1(U_{i j}), 
      g_{i j k} \in C^\infty(U_{i j k}, U(1)) )
  $$
  such that for all $i, j$
  $$
    d A_{i j} + B_i - B_j = 0
  $$
  and for all $i,j ,k$
  $$
    A_{i j} - A_{i k} + A_{j k} + d log g_{i j k} = 0
  $$
  and for all $i, j, k ,l$
  $$
    g_{i j k} g_{i k l} = g_{i j l} g_{j k l}    
    \,.
  $$
  Such cocycles classify $U(1)$-[[bundle gerbes]]
  with connection.
