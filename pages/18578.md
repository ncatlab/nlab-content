## Idea

In _[[perturbative quantum field theory]]_ a _tadpole_ is a contribution to the [[S-matrix]]/[[scattering amplitude]] corresponding to a [[Feynman diagram]] which contains an [[edge]] that connects some [[vertex]] with itself.

Typically tadpoles are required to be absent. For instance the construction of [[time-ordered products]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] via the "star product" induced by the [[Feynman propagator]] (see [there](S-matrix#ExistenceAndRenormalization)) implies that tadpoles are absent.
