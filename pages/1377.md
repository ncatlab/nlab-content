## Idea ##

A _lax 2-adjunction_ is an [[adjunction]] 'up to adjointness'.  A 1-categorical adjunction is given by a [[natural isomorphism]] of [[hom-set]]s

$$\phi_{A,B} : D(F A,B) \cong C(A,G B).$$

A [[strict 2-adjunction]] is analogous, where $C,D$ are instead [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]], $F,G$ are [[strict 2-functor|strict 2-functors]], and $\phi$ is a strictly 2-natural isomorphism of hom-categories, while a [[biadjunction]] or [[pseudoadjunction]] allows all of these to be "weak up to isomorphism".

A __lax 2-adjunction__ is instead given by a (suitably natural) pair of functors

$$\hat\phi_{A,B} : D(F A,B) \overset{\to}{\leftarrow} C(A,G B) :
\check\phi_{A,B} $$

such that we have an *adjunction* $\check\phi\dashv\hat\phi$.  Independently of this laxness aspect, we can make a choice of weakness or strictness for the categories, functors, and natural transformations involved; thus one might speak of "lax biadjunctions", "lax pseudoadjunctions", and so on.

It is not entirely clear that the term "lax 2-adjunction" is appropriate; in particular it is not an instance of the general notion of [[lax algebras]], unlike nearly all other usages of the word "lax".  Other terms that have been used for the same or similar notions are "transcendental quasi-adjunction" [(Gray)](#Gray) and "local adjunction" [(Betti-Power)](#BP).


## Definition ##

Just as the notion of [[adjunction]] makes sense not just in $Cat$ but in any 2-category, lax 2-adjunctions can be defined in any (possibly weak) [[3-category]] when the above is suitably reformulated by using the 2-categorical [[Yoneda lemma]].  So, given 0-cells $C,D$ and 1-cells $F:C\to D$, $G:D\to C$ in any 3-category, we say $F$ is __lax left adjoint__ to $G$ if we have

* 2-cells $\eta:C\Rightarrow G F$ and $\epsilon:F G \Rightarrow D$, and

* instead of strict triangle equalities, 3-cells (called _triangulators_)
  $s,t$

  satisfying the _swallowtail identities_:

  <center markdown="1">[[lax-adj-swlwtl-eta.png:pic]]</center>

  and

  <center markdown="1">[[lax-adj-swlwtl-eps.png:pic]]</center>

  (where if the 3-category is weak then coherences might need to be inserted to make these make sense.

When interpreted the a [[strict 3-category]] $2Cat$, the [[Gray-category]] $Gray$, or the [[tricategory]] $Bicat$, this yields three levels of weakness of "lax 2-adjunction" according to whether the categories, functors, and/or transformations are strict or pseudo.

## Further generalizations

The following remarks are incomplete.

One can additionally generalize to allow $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ to be [[lax natural transformations]].  [Gray's](#Gray) original notion of "transcendental quasi-adjunction" did this, with the 2-categories and 2-functors being strict.  Lax transformations do not live in any 3-category as usually understood, but Gray's particular case can be done in the "lax Gray-category" $Gray_\ell$.

Note also that there is no Yoneda lemma for lax transformations (though there is for pseudo ones).  So in order for $\hat\phi$ to be determined by $\eta$, $\hat\phi$ must be pseudo natural in $B$, and likewise for $\check\phi$ to be determined by $\epsilon$, it must be pseudo natural in $A$.  My guess is that laxity in the remaining variable will correspond to laxity of $\eta$ and $\epsilon$, and $s,t$ will come from the adjunction $\check\phi\dashv\hat\phi$.

One might additionally consider allowing the functors to be lax, as in [(Betti-Power)](#BP) [(Seely)](#Seely).  But lax functors are even harder to incorporate in a 3-category-like structure than lax transformations, since one can't even whisker any sort of transformation by a lax functor.  Seely also seems to say that $\hat\phi$ and $\check\phi$ are both strict in their _first_ coordinate, rather than one in the first and one in the second as seems (to me) to be necessary for a Yoneda restatement.
