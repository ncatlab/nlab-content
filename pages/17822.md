## Idea

Given a [[vector bundle]], its _dual_ is the vector bundle obtained by passing [[fiber]]-wise to the [[dual vector space]].

## Examples

* Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ with [[tangent bundle]] $T X$, the dual vector bundle is the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^\ast X$.

## Related concepts

* [[direct sum of vector bundles]]
