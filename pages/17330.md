the term dyslectic geometry refers to the geometry of (braided-)commutative 
objects in the braided monoidal category of
$k[G]^*\sharp k[G]$-modules ($k$ a field, $G$ a finite group) and in some generalizations where $k[G]$ is replaced by a more general Hopf algebra. If $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ this reduces to [[supersymmetry]].
