## Idea

**Platonism** is a position in [[philosophy]] committed to the existence of abstract entities that derives from the theory of ideas of the Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. 

Since this attitude provides a convenient ontological underpinning for mathematical concepts, platonism is one of the major schools of thought in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] as well as in spontaneous affinity with the practice of 'every-day mathematics' with its feel of objectivity and free availability of non-constructive classical modes of reasoning.

Famous mathematicians like [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Kurt GÃ¶del]] or more recently [[Alain Connes]] and [[Roger Penrose]] have advocated views akin to platonism.
