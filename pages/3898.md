
The __Scott topology__ on a [[preorder]] is the [[topological space|topology]] in which the open sets are those whose characteristic functions (from the given preorder into the preorder of [[truth values]]) preserve [[directed join]]s. This in fact ensures that, in general, the [[continuous functions]] between preorders with the Scott topologies are precisely those functions between them which preserve directed joins. (The preorder of truth values itself, therefore, when equipped with the Scott topology, becomes the open set classifier, [[Sierpinski space]].)
