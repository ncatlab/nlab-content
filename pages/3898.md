## Definition

The __Scott topology__ on a [[preordered set]] is the [[topological space|topology]] in which the [[open subsets]] (called __Scott-open__) are precisely those whose [[characteristic functions]] (from the given preorder into the preorder of [[truth values]]) preserve [[directed joins]] (and this makes them necessarily [[monotone function|monotonic]]). 

This in fact ensures that, in general, the [[continuous functions]] between preorders with Scott topologies are precisely those (necessarily monotonic) functions between them which preserve directed joins (called __Scott-continuous__). The [[poset of truth values]] itself, therefore, when equipped with the Scott topology, becomes the open-set [[classifying space|classifier]], [[Sierpinski space]].

## Properties

### As injective objects in $T_0$-spaces

In the category of $T_0$ [[topological spaces]] (see at _[[separation axiom]]_), the [[injective objects]] are precisely those given by Scott topologies on [[continuous lattices]]; as [[locales]] these are [[local compactum|locally compact]] and [[spatial locale|spatial]].
