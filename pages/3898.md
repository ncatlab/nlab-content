
The __Scott topology__ on a [[preordered set]] is the [[topological space|topology]] in which the [[open subsets]] (called __Scott-open__) are precisely those whose [[characteristic functions]] (from the given preorder into the preorder of [[truth values]]) preserve [[directed joins]] (and this makes them necessarily [[monotone function|monotonic]]). This in fact ensures that, in general, the [[continuous functions]] between preorders with Scott topologies are precisely those (necessarily monotonic) functions between them which preserve directed joins (called __Scott-continuous__). The [[poset of truth values]] itself, therefore, when equipped with the Scott topology, becomes the open-set [[classifying space|classifier]], [[Sierpinski space]].
