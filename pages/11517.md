## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]], a _spectrum with $G$-action_ is a [[spectrum object]] in the [[category]] of [[topological G-spaces]] ([e.g. Carlsson 92, def. 3.1](#Carlsson92)). The [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra with $G$-action is part of the subject of [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. 

There one typically considers a richer concept of _[[G-spectra]]_. In that context a spectrum with $G$-action is a [[G-spectrum]] for the "trivial universe" and is called a _naive G-spectrum_.

## Properties


### Relation to $G$-spectra

For $U$ a universe of $G$-[[representations]] in the sense of [[genuine G-spectra]], there is the inclusion

$$
  i \;\colon\; U^G \longrightarrow U
$$

of the [[fixed points]]. A [[genuine G-spectrum]] modeled on $U^G$ is a [[spectrum with G-action]] ("[[naive G-spectrum]]"). The induced [[adjunction]]

$$
  (i_\ast \dashv i^\ast) \;\colon\; G Spectra \longrightarrow Spectra(PSh_\infty(Orb_G))
$$

has [[unit]] and [[counit]] which are [[equivalences]] on the underlying bare [[spectra]].

(e.g. [Carlsson 92, p. 14](#Carlsson92), [Greenlees May, p. 16](#GreenleesMay))

### Homotopy fixed points and homotopy quotients

Write

$$
  (-)^G \;\colon\; Spectra(G Top) \longrightarrow Spectra
  \,.
$$

for the [[fixed point]] ([[invariants]]) [[functor]] and

$$
  (-)/Q \;\colon\; Spectra(G Top) \longrightarrow Spectra
$$

for the [[quotient]] ([[coinvariants]]) functor.

Write $E G$, as usual, for a [[contractible topological space|contractible]] [[topological G-space]] whose $G$-[[action]] is [[free action|free]]. Write $E G_+$ for this regarded as a pointed $G$-space with a point freely adjoined.

Then there are two functor

$$
  EG_+ \wedge (-) , [EG_+,-] \;\colon\;  Spectra(G Top) \to Spectra(G Top)
$$

given by forming [[smash product]] with $E G_+$ and forming the [[internal hom]] out of $E G_+$.

Then the [[homotopy fixed point]] functor is

$$
  (-)^{h g} \coloneqq [E G_+, -]^G \;\colon\; Spectra(G Top) \longrightarrow Spectra
$$

and the [[homotopy quotient]] functor is

$$
  (-)//G \coloneqq (-)_{h G} \coloneqq (E G_+ \wedge (-))/G
  \;\colon\; Spectra(G Top) \longrightarrow Spectra
$$

### Relation to equivariant cohomology
 {#RelationToEquivariantCohomology}

Spectra with $G$-action [[Brown representability theorem|represent]] $\mathbb{Z}$-graded [[equivariant cohomology]] on [[G-spaces]].

For $X$ a [[G-space]] and $E$ a spectrum with $G$-action, then the corresponding cohomology is

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(Hom(X,E)^G)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[homotopy fixed points]] of the [[mapping spectrum]], which inherits a [[conjugation action]] by $G$ from the $G$-action on $X$ and $E$.

More abstractly, in terms of the [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $T PSh_\infty(Orb)_{/\mathbf{B}G}$ of the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] of [[orbispaces]] over $\mathbf{B}G$, this means that

$$
  E(X) = \underset{\mathbf{B}G}{\prod} [X,E]
$$

is the [[dependent product]] over $\mathbf{B}G$ of the intrinsic [[cohomology]] of the tangent slice topos. See at _[[∞-action]]_ for more on this.

Notice here [[Elmendorf's theorem]] which identifies [[G-spaces]] with [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over the [[orbit category]] $Orb_G$. It is via this equivalence that spectra with $G$-action represent [[equivariant cohomology]] in the form of [[Bredon cohomology]].

Hence exhibiting a spectrum $E$ with $G$-action as a [[spectrum]]-valued [[presheaf]] on the [[orbit category]] means to assign to any [[coset space]] $G/H$ of $G$ the $H$-[[homotopy fixed points]] of $E$:

$$
  E//G \;\colon\;  G/H \mapsto E^{H}
  \,.
$$
