## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]], a _spectrum with $G$-action_ is a [[spectrum object]] in the [[category]] of [[topological G-spaces]] ([e.g. Carlsson 92, def. 3.1](#Carlsson92)). The [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra with $G$-action is part of the subject of [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. 

There one typically considers a richer concept of _[[G-spectra]]_. In that context a specturm with $G$-action is a [[G-spectrum]] for the "trivial universe" and is called a _naive G-spectrum_.

## Properties
