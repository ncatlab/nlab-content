##General Idea


In [[philosophy of science]] and specifically in the [[philosophy of physics]],  **coordination** concerns the relationship between [[theory (physics)|scientific theory]] and [[experiment|empirical data]]. A [[physical theory]], written, say, as a set of [[equations]] or similar data, does not by itself allow the formation of predictions. In addition we need some way of mediating between this theory and what instruments can detect about the [[observable universe]]. 

For example an abstract [[differential equation]] on the [[sections]] of some abstract [[fiber bundle]] does not constitute a theory of physics unless one specifies which kind of [[field (physics)|physical field]] these sections are meant to represent. 

The nature of the field however determines a rule for how to measure it: If we are told that the theory is meant to be about the [[electromagnetic field]], say [[electromagnetic waves]], we test it by measuring, say, [[Lorentz forces]] on [[electrons]]; while if we are told that the theory is meant to be about [[gravity]], say [[gravitational waves]], we test it by entirely different measurements (e.g. via the [[LIGO]] experiment). 

But this distinction may not be reflected in the plain [[mathematics]] that constitutes the physical, theory: In the previous example both [[electromagnetic waves]] and [[gravitational waves]] may be described,  after appropriate [[gauge fixing]], by the same kind of [[wave equation]]. Hence _coordination_ is involved in specifying what aspect of observable reality this equation is meant to be referring to.


##History

The term *coordination* is a translation of the German *Zuordnung*. The latter has a long history of use with [[mathematics]] as something like _assignment_, hence _[[function]]_. Its use in [[philosophy]] stretches back to [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s *Zeichentheorie*, and was taken up later by a number of philosophers, especially by those, such as Ernst Cassirer, trying to understand the implications for epistemology of the profound transformations which took place in mathematics and physics at the turn of the nineteenth century ([[special relativity]], [[general relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]]).

In his *Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre* ([Schlick18](#Schlick18})), Moritz Schlick  relies heavily on the notion of coordination, proposing that it should be understood as a simple [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[mapping]] between the system of implicitly defined terms of a physical theory and some system of given objects or elements of sensation. A few years later, Hans Reichenbach, by contrast, argued ([Reichenbach 24](#Reichenbach24)) that the act of coordination was no mere mapping between existing systems, but itself played a constitutive role in defining the objects of knowledge themselves:

>The difficulty concerning coordinative definitions is similar to that concerning elementary facts: the physical thing that is coordinated is not an immediate perceptual experience but must be constructed from such experience by means of an interpretation. If I establish the coordinative definition "a light ray is a straight line", then the coordinated physical thing, the light ray, is a construction going beyond perception. ([1924](#Reichenbach24), p. 8)

A central issue between these accounts is that the more you press on the constitutive function of coordinating principles, the more it seems that the entities referred to by physics owe their characteristics to our conceptual framing rather than to how things are in themselves.

## In quantum mechanics
 

### Bohrification

The idea of _[[Bohr toposes]]_ might be regarded as an attempt to formalize coordination for [[observables]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. There the idea is roughly that to a [[quantum mechanical system]] one assigns a [[topos]] (the "[[Bohr topos]]") such that the (or some of the) [[propositions]] in the [[internal logic]] of this topos match propositions about [[observables]] of the [[physical system]].


### Relation to interpretation of QM
 {#RelationToInterpretationOfQM}

Coordination is different from -- in fact somewhat orthogonal to -- [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. For instance a coordination in [[quantum mechanics]] involves relating [[self-adjoint operators]] to certain [[experiments]]. Given this coordination, the theory assigns [[expectation values]] for the outcomes of the experiment, but it does not necessarily offer an "interpretation why" these propbabilities are predicted.

On the other hand, it might be that a good formulation of the coordination process makes the need/desire for interpretations diminish. This was argued by ([Tanona 10](#Tanona10)):

>...the characterization of collapse as a separate physical process is misguided because the phenomenon which collapse is supposed to address concerns not an actual process within quantum mechanical theory but rather the coordination between empirical measurements and representations of quantum systems. Until we first get clear on this relationship, it is premature to propose new processes to account for features of that relationship.
