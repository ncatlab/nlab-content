##General Idea

**Coordination** concerns the relationship between scientific theory and empirical data. A physical theory, written say as a set of equations, does not by itself allow the formation of predictions. In addition we need some way of mediating between this theory and what our instruments can detect about the universe. For example, to connect Einstein's equations about the curvature of space-time to predicted observations of the direction of light coming from distant stars and passing close to the sun, general relativity postulates that light follows a null geodesic. 

##History

The term *coordination* is a translation of the German *Zuordnung*. The latter has a long history of use with mathematics as something like [[function]]. Its use in philosophy stretches back to [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s *Zeichentheorie*, and was taken up later by a number of philosophers, especially by those, such as Ernst Cassirer, trying to understand the implications for epistemology of the profound transformations which took place in mathematics and physics at the turn of the nineteenth century.

In his *Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre* (1918), Moritz Schlick relies heavily on the notion of coordination, proposing that it should be understood as a simple set-theoretic mapping between the system of implicitly defined terms of a physical theory and some system of given objects or elements of sensation. A few years later, Hans Reichenbach, by contrast, argued that the act of coordination was no mere mapping between existing systems, but itself played a constitutive role in defining the objects of knowledge themselves.

>The difficulty concerning coordinative definitions is similar to that concerning elementary facts: the physical thing that is coordinated is not an immediate perceptual experience but must be constructed from such experience by means of an interpretation. If I establish the coordinative definition “a light ray is a straight line,” then the coordinated physical thing, the light ray, is a construction going beyond perception. (1924, p. 8)

A central issue between these accounts is that the more you press on the constitutive function of coordinating principles, the more it seems that the entities referred to by physics owe their characteristics to our conceptual framing rather than to how things are in themselves.
