## Idea

The _Chern-Simons propagator_ is the [[Feynman propagator]] for [[Chern-Simons theory]] regarded as a [[Euclidean quantum field theory]]. Since the [[Feynman propagator]] only depends on the [[free field theory]]-[[equations of motion]] (the staring point of [[perturbative QFT]]), which here is $d A = 0$, its form is independent of the [[gauge group]] and in fact applies also to all [[higher Chern-Simons theories]] such as notably the [[AKSZ sigma-models]].

In the perturbative [[quantization of 3d Chern-Simons theory]] the CS propagator was first studied in [Axelrod-Singer 91](#AxelrodSinger91). 

### As a smooth differential form on compactified configuration spaces

The Chern-Simons propagator was re-formulated as a [[Feynman amplitudes on compactified configuration spaces of points|smooth differential form on compactified configuration space]] in [Axelrod-Singer 93, p. 5-6](#AxelrodSinger93). In this specific form its mathematical nature was amplified in [Bott-Cattaneo 97, remark 3.6](#BottCattaneo97) and [Cattaneo-Mnev 10, Remark 11](#CattaneoMnev10). It was suggested that this serves to exhibit its [[Feynman amplitudes]] as exhibiting a [[graph complex]]-model for the [[de Rham cohomology]] of [[configuration spaces of points]] in [Kontsevich 93](#Kontsevich93), [Kontsevich 94](#Kontsevich94), which was proven in [Lambrechts-Volic 14](#LambrechtsVolic14). This role of the Chern-Simons propagator is advertized also in [Campos-Idrissi-Lambrechts-Willwacher 18, p. 66](#CamposIdrissiLambrechtsWillwacher18).
