## Idea

A _2-module bundle_  / _2-vector bundle_ is a [[fiber ∞-bundle]] whose typical fiber is a [[2-module]]/[[2-vector space]]. 

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], or more generally an [[E-∞ ring]]. By the discussion at [[2-vector space]] consider the [[2-category]]

$$
  2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$ 

[[equivalence of 2-categories|equivalent]] to that whose objects are [[associative algebras]] (or generally [[A-∞ algebra|algebras]]) $A$ over $R$, (being placeholders for the 2-vector space $A Mod$ which is the category of [[modules]] over $A$) whose [[1-morphisms]] are [[bimodules]] between these algebras (inducing linear functors between the corresponding 2-vector spaces = categories of modules) and whose [[2-morphisms]] are [[homomorphisms]] between those. 

Under [[Isbell duality]] and by the discussion at _[Modules -- as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction)_  we may think of this 2-category as being that of (generalized) 2-vector bundles over a [[space]] called $Spec R$.
