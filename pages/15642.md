## Idea

Generally, a _functional equation_ is an [[equation]] between values of a [[function]] which serves to characterize that function.

Specifically one speaks of the functional equations which characterize the [[Riemann zeta function]], [[Jacobi theta functions]] and more generally [[zeta functions]] and [[theta functions]].
