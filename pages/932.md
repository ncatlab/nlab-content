## Definition

### In dg-Lie algebras

For $(\mathfrak{g}, [-,-],\partial)$ a [[dg-Lie algebra]] (the [[differential]] of degree -1), a **Maurer-Cartan element** in $\mathfrak{g}$ is

* an element $v \in \mathfrak{g}_1$ of degree -1

* such that the **Maurer-Cartan equation** holds

  $$
    \partial a + [a,a] = 0 
     \,.
  $$

## Examples


For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]], $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], ther eis a canonical dg-Lie algebra structure on $\Omega^\bullet(X) \otimes \mathfrak{g}$. 

A Maurer-Cartan element is then precisely a [[Lie algebra valued 1-form]] $A$ whose [[curvature]] 2-form vanishes

$$
  d_{dR} A + [A \wedge A] = 0
  \,.
$$

## Range of versions and applications

_Maurer--Cartan equation_ is a name for very many related equations in [[geometry]], [[algebra]], [[deformation theory]], [[category theory]] and [[quantization theory]]. Such equations express for example certain conditions in theory of isometric embedding of submanifolds into a euclidean space ('structure equations', with relations to the Lie groups $O(n)$), invariance of invariant differential forms ([[Maurer-Cartan form|Maurer-Cartan forms]]) on Lie groups, flatness of connections on principal or associated fibre bundles, the solutions in some contexts parametrize infinitesimal deformations, or define [[twisting cochain|twisting cochains]].
In the context of BV-quantization, a Maurer--Cartan equation has the role of classical master equation.

A Maurer--Cartan equation for $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebra]]s is usually referred to as a _generalized Maurer--Cartan equation_ as it has more summands than the one for [[dg-algebra]]s. In some contexts like $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-category|categories]], some authors prefer the geometric terminology 'homological vector field' as a datum on a formal geometric space which satisfies a Maurer--Cartan equation. Solutions to Maurer-Cartan equation for a dg- or $A_\infty$ algebra are called Maurer-Cartan elements. 

## Maurer-Cartan and Lie theory

Sophus Lie considered groups of transformations first and discovered [[Lie algebra]]s only later (letter to Mayer, 1874). He has shown that infinitesimally one can solve the Maurer--Cartan equations for a given set of structure constants of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. This means that one can construct a neighborhood with either the invariant differential form, or dually the invariant vector fields whose commutator corresponds to the commutator of the Lie algebra. This amounts to integrating the Lie algebra to a [[local Lie group]]. Only much later, Elie Cartan succeeded in proving the global version of integration, that is the Cartan--Lie theorem. J-P. Serre in an influential textbook called the Cartan--Lie theorem the "[[Lie's three theorems|third Lie theorem]]", which became a rather popular term in recent years, though one should correctly call so just the theorem on local solvability of Maurer--Cartan equation.
