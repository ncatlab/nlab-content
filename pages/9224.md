## Definition

For $(X, \mu)$ a [[measure space]] of finite total measure $\int_X \mu$ and for $f$ an [[measurable function]] on $X$, its **expectation value** is 

$$
  \langle f\rangle
  \coloneqq
  \frac{\int_X f \cdot \mu}{\int_X \mu}
 \,.
$$

In terms of the [[probability measure]] $\mu_P \coloneqq \frac{1}{\int_X \mu} \mu$ this is simply the [[integral]]

$$
  \langle f\rangle
  = 
 \int_X f \cdot \mu_P
  \,.
$$
