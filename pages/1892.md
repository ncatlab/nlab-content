>This page was inspired by a [question from Jim Stasheff](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025514) on the n-Cafe.

#Copying and Pasting Material from an n-Cafe#

When you write a comment on the [n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/), most of the formatting will carry straight over to the n-Lab with little need for modification. This is true even for <nowiki>LaTeX</nowiki> content (which is actually [itex](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html), but that is not important). So all you really need to know to get started is how to paste material to the nLab.

To do this, note the "Edit" link at the bottom of each page.

***
<img src="http://ncatlab.org/ericforgy/files/edit.jpg" width = "500"/>
***

This will bring up the edit box.

***
<img src="http://ncatlab.org/ericforgy/files/editbox.jpg" width = "500"/>
***

From here, you simply paste whatever content you want into the edit box and hit the "Submit" button at the bottom. Putting your name in the text box next to the "Submit" button is optional.

#Inserting a Link to the n-Cafe#

The first thing you want to do in order to insert a link on the n-Lab that points to the n-Cafe is to get a copy of the n-Cafe link.

The link to this comment on the n-Cafe is:

<blockquote>

http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025514

</blockquote>

To add a link with the label "Link to the n-Cafe", you need a combination of square brackets and parentheses <nowiki>[Link Name](Link URL)</nowiki> as indicated below:

<blockquote>

<nowiki>[Link to the n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025514)</nowiki>

</blockquote>

This results in a [Link to the n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025514).

#Additional Comments#
>If someone could clean this up, it would be great.

* If you don’t know where to put your material, google for “nLab [your keywords]” to see which entries exist

* If the entry with the title that you are looking for does not yet exist, find some entry that is somehow related, go to the edit window as described above and add a line “see also <nowiki>[[your keyword]]</nowiki>”. Then after hitting submit the <nowiki>[[your keyword]]</nowiki> will appear with a clickable question mark. Click on that question mark to create the desired entry.

* OPTIONAL if you want to be sophisticated: add links back and forth between other nLab entries: enclose important keyword sin your material in double brackets. That equips them with links to the corresponding other nLab entries. Conversely, go to related nLab entries and add pointers to the entry you just created.

* General Remark: Don’t worry if things don’t come out quite the way you would like them at the first go – the important point is that we have your material in some form - others will eventually go over the entry and polish it, if necessary
