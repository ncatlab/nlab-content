For $(C,\otimes, I)$ a [[monoidal category]] and $X \in C$ any [[object]], the **endomorphism operad** $End_C(X)$ of $X$ in $C$ is the [[operad]] whose set of $n$-ary operations is the [[hom-set]]

$$
  End_C(X)_k := Hom_C(X \otimes \cdots k factors \cdots \otimes X, X)
  \,,
$$

This comes with the obvious composition operation induced from the composition in $C$.

There are obvious generalizations of this definition to the [[enriched category theory|enriched]] context and to the context of [[(âˆž,1)-operad]]s.
