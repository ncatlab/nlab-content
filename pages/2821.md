## Idea

The endomorphism operad of a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is an [[operad]] whose $n$-ary operations are the [[morphisms]] out of $n$-fold [[tensor products]] in $C$, i.e.

$$
  End(C)_n(c_1, \cdots, c_n,c)
  := 
  Hom_C(c_1\otimes \cdots \otimes c_n, c)
  \,.
$$


## Definition ##

Endomorphism operads come in two favors, one being a [[planar operad]], the other a [[symmetric operad]].


For $(C,\otimes, I)$ a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category]], the **endomorphism operad** $End_C(X)$ of $X$ in $C$ is the [[symmetric operad]]/ [[planar operad]] whose colors are the obejects of $C$, and whose objects of $n$-ary operations are the [[hom objects]]

$$
  End_C(X)(c_1, \cdots, c_n ; c) := 
C(c_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes c_n,\; c)
  \,,
$$

This comes with the obvious composition operation induced from the composition in $C$. Moreover, in the symmetric case there is a canoncial action of the symmetric group induced.

For $S \subset Obj(C)$ any subset of objects, the **$S$-colored endomorphism operad** of $C$ is the restrictoin of the endomorphism operad defined to the set of colors being $S$.

In particular, the endomorphism operad of a single object $c \in C$, often denoted $End(c)$, is the single-colored operad whose $n$-ary operations are the morphism $c^{\otimes n}\to c$ in $C$.

## Properties

### Algebras

The structure of an [[algebra over an operad]] on an object $A \in C$ over $P$ is equivalently a [[morphism]] of operads

$$
 \rho : P \to End(A)
$$
