## Idea

The _endomorphism operad_ of a [[monoidal category]] $C$ -- also called the _[[multicategory]] represented by $C$_ -- is an [[operad]] whose $n$-ary operations are the [[morphisms]] out of $n$-fold [[tensor products]] in $C$, i.e.

$$
  End(C)_n(c_1, \cdots, c_n,c)
  := 
  Hom_C(c_1\otimes \cdots \otimes c_n, c)
  \,.
$$


## Definition ##

Endomorphism operads come in two flavors, one being a [[planar operad]], the other a [[symmetric operad]]. Mostly the discussion of both cases proceeds in parallel.

We first give the simple pedestrian definition in terms of explicit components, and then a more abstract definition, which is useful for studying some general properties of endomorphism operads.

### In terms of components

For $(C,\otimes, I)$ a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category]], the **endomorphism operad** $End_C(X)$ of $X$ in $C$ is the [[symmetric operad]]/ [[planar operad]] whose colors are the obejects of $C$, and whose objects of $n$-ary operations are the [[hom objects]]

$$
  End_C(X)(c_1, \cdots, c_n ; c) := 
C(c_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes c_n,\; c)
  \,,
$$

This comes with the obvious composition operation induced from the composition in $C$. Moreover, in the symmetric case there is a canoncial action of the symmetric group induced.

For $S \subset Obj(C)$ any subset of objects, the **$S$-colored endomorphism operad** of $C$ is the restrictoin of the endomorphism operad defined to the set of colors being $S$.

In particular, the endomorphism operad of a single object $c \in C$, often denoted $End(c)$, is the single-colored operad whose $n$-ary operations are the morphism $c^{\otimes n}\to c$ in $C$.

### In terms of Cartesian monads

Let $T : Set \to Set$ be the [[free monoid]] [[monad]]. Notice, from the discussion at _[[multicategory]]_, that a [[planar operad]] $P$ over [[Set]] with set of colors $C$ is equivalently a monad in the [[bicategory]] of $T$-[[spans]]

$$
  \array{
     && P
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     T C && && C
  }
  \,.
$$

In this language, for $C$ a (strict) [[monoidal category]], the corresponding endomorphism operad is given by the $T$-span

$$
  \array{
      && & & T Obj(C) \times_{Obj(C)} Mor(C)
      \\
      && & \swarrow && \searrow 
      \\
      && T Obj(C) && && Mor(C)
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{id}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\otimes}}
    && {}^{\mathllap{s}}\swarrow
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{t}}
     \\
     T Obj(C) &&&& Obj(C) &&&& Obj(C)
  }
  \,,
$$

where $\otimes : T Obj(C) \to C$ denotes the iterated tensor product in $C$, and
where the top square is defined to be the [[pullback]], as indicated.




## Properties

### Algebras

The structure of an [[algebra over an operad]] on an object $A \in C$ over $P$ is equivalently a [[morphism]] of operads

$$
 \rho : P \to End(A)
$$


### Relation to categories of operators
 {#UniversalCharacterization}

To every [[operad]] $P$ is associated its [[category of operators]] $P^{\otimes}$, which is a monoidal category. 
With that suitably defined, forming endomorphism operads is  [[2-adjunction|right 2-adjoint]] to forming categories of operators. See ([Hermida, theorem 7.3](#Hermida)) for a precise statement in the context of [[non-symmetric operads]] and strict monoidal categories.
