This is a research group formed within [[PPS]], working on [[rewriting]] and [[Coq]].


The team $\pi r^2$ covers three research topics: 

*  Fundamental research concerning the correspondence between proofs and programs 

*  Theoretical research on the formalism that underlies the Coq proof assistant 

*  An implementation research field with the development of Coq, especially in the view of Coq as dependently-typed programming language
