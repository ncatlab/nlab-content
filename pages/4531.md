Here we copy the abstract and future additional information:

> Maxim Kontsevich will speak about two a priori unrelated theories which lead to the same class of wall-crossing formulae.

> The first one is the theory of (motivic, or refined) Donaldson-Thomas invariants. It applies to
> 1) quivers (maybe with potentials), including cluster categories and  matrix models,
> 2) moduli of coherent sheaves on algebraic surfaces, moduli of representations of an arbitrary finitely presented algebra,
> 3) 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories.

> One can define in each of these cases appropriate cohomology groups of moduli spaces, carrying a generalization of mixed Hodge structure. The generating series for Serre polynomials splits into an infinite product of quantum dilogarithms, depending on stability structure. Exponents in this expansion are refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and they jump in a universal way when we cross a wall in the space of stability structures.

> The second theory is about the behavior of collapsing hyperkahler metrics, and of WKB asymptotics for complex integrable systems. Here one counts holomorphic discs with boundaries on Lagrangian submanifolds.

> Physics partially explains the relation between two theories, via BPS counting and geometry of hypermultiplet moduli spaces.
