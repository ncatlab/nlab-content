## Idea

For $X$ a ([[spacetime]]) [[manifold]] and $E \to X$ a [[bundle]] with [[jet bundle]] $j_\infty E \to X$, the **variarional bicomplex** is essentially the [[de Rham complex]] of $j_\infty E$ with [[differential form]]s bigraded by horizontal degree (with respect to $X$) and vertical degree (along the [[fiber]]s of $j_\infty E$)). Accordingly the [[differential]] decomposes as

$$
  D = d + \delta
  \,,
$$

where $d$ is the [[de Rham differential]] on $X$ and $\delta$ is the variational differential.

Much of [[classical mechanics]] and [[classical field theory]] on $X$ is formalized in terms of the variational bicomplex. For instance 

* a field configuration is a [[section]] of $E$;

* a [[Lagrangian]] is an element $L \in \Omega^{n,0}(j_\infty E)$;

* a [[local action functional]] is a maps

  $$
    S : \Gamma(E) \to \marthbb{R}
  $$

  of the form

  $$
    S(\phi) = \int_X L(j_\infty \phi)
    \,,
  $$

* the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]] is 

  $$
    E(L) := \delta L mod im(d) = 0
  $$

* the [[covariant phase space]] is the locus 

  $$
    \{
     \phi \in \Gamma(E) | E(L)(j_\infty \phi) = 0
   \}
  $$

* a [[conserved current]] is an element in $\Omega^{n-1,0}(j_\infty E)$ that is $d$-closed on covariant phase space;

* a [[symmetry]] is a vertical vector field $v$ such that
  
  $$
    v(L) = 0 mod im(d)
  $$

* [[Noether's theorem]] asserts that every [[symmetry]] induces a [[conserved current]].
