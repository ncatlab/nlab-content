
__$Quiv$__ or __$DiGraph$__ is the category of [[quivers]] or (as category theorists often call them) [[directed graphs]].

We can define a quiver to be a functor $G\colon X^{op} \to Set$, where $X^{op}$ is the [[category]] with an [[object]] $0$, an object $1$ and two [[morphisms]] $s, t\colon 1 \to 0$, along with [[identity morphisms]].  This lets us efficiently define $Quiv$ as the category of [[presheaves]] on $X$, where:

* objects are [[functors]] $G\colon X^{op} \to C$,
* morphisms are [[natural transformations]] between such functors.

In other words, $Quiv$ is the [[functor category]] from this $X^{op}$ to [[Set]].

## As a topos 

The category $Quiv = Set^{X^{op}}$, being a category of [[presheaves]], is a [[topos]]. The [[representable functors]] $X(-, 0), X(-, 1)$ may be pictured as the "generic figures" (generic vertex, generic edge) that occur in directed graphs: 

$$X(-, 0) = \bullet, \qquad X(-, 1) = (x \stackrel{e}{\to} y)$$ 

and from this picture we easily see that $X(-, 0)$ has two subobjects $\emptyset, \bullet$ whereas $X(-, 1)$ has five: $empty, x, y, (x, y), (x \stackrel{e}{\to} y)$. 

This in turn allows us to calculate the structure of the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$: it is the quiver with two vertices and five edges that looks roughly like 

$$\array{
\emptyset & \underoverset{x}{y}{\rightleftarrows} & \bullet \\ 
\mathllap{empty} \circlearrowleft & & \circlearrowleft \circlearrowleft \mathrlap{x \stackrel{e}{\to} y} \\ 
 & & \mathllap{(x, y)}  
}$$ 

(so there is one loop labeled "empty" at the vertex $\emptyset$, and two loops at the vertex $\bullet$, one labeled $(x, y)$ and the other $x \stackrel{e}{\to} y$).
