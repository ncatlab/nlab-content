## Idea

__$Quiv$__ or __$DiGraph$__ is the category of [[quivers]] or (as category theorists often call them) [[directed graphs]]. It can be viewed as the default categorical model for the concept of a category of graphs.

## Definition

We can define a quiver to be a functor $G\colon X^{op} \to Set$, where $X^{op}$ is the [[category]] with an [[object]] $0$, an object $1$ and two [[morphisms]] $s, t\colon 1 \to 0$, along with [[identity morphisms]].  This lets us efficiently define $Quiv$ as the category of [[presheaves]] on $X$, where:

* objects are [[functors]] $G\colon X^{op} \to Set$,
* morphisms are [[natural transformations]] between such functors.

In other words, $Quiv$ is the [[functor category]] from this $X^{op}$ to [[Set]].

## As a topos 

The category $Quiv = Set^{X^{op}}$, being a category of [[presheaves]], is a [[topos]]. The [[representable functors]] $X(-, 0), X(-, 1)$ may be pictured as the "generic figures" (generic vertex, generic edge) that occur in directed graphs: 

$$X(-, 0) = \bullet, \qquad X(-, 1) = (x \stackrel{e}{\to} y)$$ 

and from this picture we easily see that $X(-, 0)$ has two subobjects $\emptyset, \bullet$ whereas $X(-, 1)$ has five: $empty, x, y, (x, y), (x \stackrel{e}{\to} y)$. 

### The subobject classifier

Knowing the subobjects of the representable functors in turn allows us to calculate the structure of the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ since they correspond to the elements of the value of $\Omega$ at the corresponding objects of $X^{op}$ i.e. the set of vertices of $\Omega$ is $\Omega(0)=\{\emptyset,\bullet\}$ and the set of edges is $\Omega(1)=\{empty, x, y, (x, y), (x \stackrel{e}{\to} y)\}$.

Whence pictured $\Omega$ is the quiver with two vertices and five edges that looks roughly like 

$$\array{
\emptyset & \underoverset{x}{y}{\rightleftarrows} & \bullet \\ 
\mathllap{empty} \circlearrowleft & & \circlearrowleft \circlearrowleft \mathrlap{x \stackrel{e}{\to} y} \\ 
 & & \mathllap{(x, y)}  
}$$ 

(so there is one loop labeled "empty" at the vertex $\emptyset$, and two loops at the vertex $\bullet$, one labeled $(x, y)$ and the other $x \stackrel{e}{\to} y$). 

How does $\Omega$ work? Suppose that $X\subseteq Y$ is a subgraph and $\chi_X:Y\to\Omega$ its characteristic map, then $\chi_X$ maps vertices of $Y$ not in $X$ to $\emptyset$ and vertices in $X$ to $\bullet$ (a vertex is either contained in a subgraph or not - the choice is binary and, accordingly, $\Omega$ needs two vertices to represent this). For edges the situation is more complicated since there are five ways (and, accordingly five edges in $\Omega$ to represent this) for an edge $z$ of $Y$ to be related to the subgraph $X$: the most straightforward is when $z$ has neither source nor target in $X$, such $z$ are definitely not in $X$ and are represented in $\Omega$ by the loop at $\emptyset$. Now suppose that $z$ has either source or target vertex in $X$ but not both: $\chi_X$ maps these to the maps $x,y$ between $\emptyset\rightleftarrows\bullet$, respectively. When $z$ has both source and target in $X$, the edge itself might or might not be in $X$, and the corresponding two cases are represented by the two loops at $\bullet$ , respectively.
