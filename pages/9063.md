## Definition

The dual notion of a [[fiber sequence]]:

for $\mathcal{C}$ an [[(infinity,1)-category]] with [[(infinity,1)-pushouts]], a sequence of [[morphisms]] $A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \to C$ is a _cofiber sequence_ if there is an [[(infinity,1)-pushout]] square

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& C
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$. We say that $C$ is the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $f$.

## Properties

### Presentation

Under mild conditions on a [[category with weak equivalences]] presenting $\mathcal{C}$, homotopy cofibers are presented by [[mapping cones]]. See there for more details.
