## Definition

A cofiber sequence is the dual notion to a [[fiber sequence]].

For $\mathcal{C}$ an [[(infinity,1)-category]] with [[(infinity,1)-pushouts]], a sequence of [[morphisms]] $A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \to C$ is a _cofiber sequence_ if there is an [[(infinity,1)-pushout]] square

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& C
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$. We say that $C$ is the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $f$.

## Properties

### Presentation

Under mild conditions on a [[category with weak equivalences]] presenting $\mathcal{C}$ (such as a [[model category]]), homotopy cofibers are presented by [[mapping cones]]. See there for more details.

## Examples

In a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], every [[fiber sequence]] is also a cofiber sequence and conversely.

### Non-examples

In the unstable case, most fiber sequences are not cofiber sequences or conversely.  For instance, if $0\to K\to G\to H \to 0$ is a [[short exact sequence]] of [[groups]], then the corresponding maps of [[classifying spaces]] $\mathbf{B}K \to \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}H$ always form a [[fiber sequence]], but not generally a cofiber sequence.

For a concrete counterexample, consider the short exact squence $0 \to \mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{2} \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/2 \to 0 $.  Upon taking classifying spaces this becomes $S^1 \to S^1 \to RP^{\infty}$, in which the first map is a double cover whose cofiber is $RP^2$.
