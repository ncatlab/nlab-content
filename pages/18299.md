## Idea

A _differentiable vector bundle_ is a [[vector bundle]] in the context of _[[differential geometry]]_: a _differentiably varying collection of [[vector space]] over a given [[differentiable manifold]].

All this for some specified degree of [[differentiation|differentiability]]. If one demands arbitrary differentiabiliy then one speaks of _smooth vector bundles_ over [[smooth manifolds]].

## Examples

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]], then its [[tangent bundle]] $T X \to X$ is a differentiable vector bundle, see [this lemma](tangent+bundle#DifferentiableTangentBundle).
