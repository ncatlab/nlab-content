## Idea

A central result in the construction of [[perturbative quantum field theories]] via the method of [[causal perturbation theory]] is called the _main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory_. This says that given a suitable [[free field theory|free]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] $(E,\mathbf{L}_{kin})$, then any two _[[renormalization schemes]]_ for [[perturbative quantum field theory]] around this free field theory, hence any two solutions $S$, $S'$ to the [[induction|inductive]] construction of the [[perturbative S-matrix]] as a [[function]] 

$$
  S 
   \;\colon\; 
  LocObs(E,\mathbf{L}_{kin})[ [\hbar] ] 
    \longrightarrow
  PolyObs(E,\mathbf{L}_{kin})[ [\hbar] ]
$$

from [[local observables]] $\mathbf{L}_{int}$, regarded as [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functionals]]  $\tau_\Sigma \mathbf{L}_{int}$, to scattering [[Wick algebra]] elements $S(\mathbf{L}_{kin})$, are related by a unique transformation 

$$
  Z 
    \;\colon\;
  LocObs(E,\mathbf{L}_{kin})[ [\hbar] ]
    \longrightarrow
  LocObs(E,\mathbf{L}_{kin})[ [\hbar] ]
$$

via

$$
  S' = S \circ Z
  \,.
$$

The collection of these operations $Z$ forms a [[group]], called the _[[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]]_. Hence the space of [[renormalization schemes]] is a [[torsor]] over this group.

Via the perspective of the [[Gell-Mann-Low cocycles]] this theorem is a mathematical reflection of the idea that renormalization is about regarding a [[perturbative quantum field theory]] with [[interaction]] $V$ as a [[effective field theory]] at some energy scale and then discovering that at higher energy there is a more fundamental interaction $Z(V)$ which effectively looks like $V$ at lower energy.
