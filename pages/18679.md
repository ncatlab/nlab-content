## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] an "auxiliary field" is a [[field (physics)|field]] [[type]] that is introduced on top of the [[field (physics)|fields]] in the [[field theory]] genuinely of interest, in order to bring that field theory of actual interest into another form -- usually while not actually changing it up to [[equivalence]] -- which lends itself better to certain purposes.

## Examples

For example under suitable conditions a field theory with [[constraints]] may be formulated equivalently as another field theory without explicit constraints, but with an auxiliary [[Lagrange multiplier]] field which does induce that constraint after all, but indirectly so via its [[equation of motion]].

In [[BV-BRST formalism]], a powerful generalization of this idea of [[Lagrange multiplier]] is the usage of auxiliary fields that allow to define "[[gauge fixing fermions]]" to implement [[gauge fixing]] via their [[equations of motion]]. 

For instance in the [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]] the _[[Nakanishi-Lautrup field]]_ (and its "[[antighost field]]") are auxiliary fields that are introduced in order to indirectly induce [[gauge fixing]] to [[Lorentz gauge]]. The [[BV-BRST formalism]] also makes precise how exactly this introduction of auxiliary fields does not change the field theory, up to [[equivalence]]: the auxiliary fields change the [[BV-BRST complex]] (which effectivley defines the field theory) only up to a [[quasi-isomorphism]], i.e. the relevant notion of [[equivalence]] in this context. 

In fact even before it comes to [[gauge fixing]], [[BV-BRST formalism]] introduces a variety of auxiliary fields: the [[ghosts]], the [[ghosts-of-ghosts]], etc., and the [[antifields]].
