# Reflective factorization systems
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Idea

A *reflective factorization system* is an [[orthogonal factorization system]] $(E,M)$ that is determined by the [[reflective subcategory]] $M/1$.

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with a [[terminal object]] $1$.  If $(E,M)$ is an (orthogonal) [[orthogonal factorization system|factorization system]] on $C$, then the [[full subcategory]] $M/1 \subseteq C$ (consisting of those objects $X$ for which $X\to 1$ is in $M$) is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]].  The reflection of $Y\in C$ is obtained by the $(E,M)$-factorization $Y \xrightarrow{e} \ell Y \xrightarrow{m} 1$.

In fact, in this we do not need $(E,M)$ to be a factorization system; only a [[prefactorization system]] with the property that any morphism with terminal [[codomain]] admits an $(E,M)$-factorization.  For the nonce, let us call such a prefactorization system *favorable*.

Conversely, suppose that $A\subseteq C$ is a reflective subcategory, and define $E$ to be the class of morphisms inverted by the [[reflector]] $\ell\colon C\to A$, and define $M = E^\perp$.  Then $(E,M)$ is a favorable prefactorization system.  In this way we obtain an [[adjunction]] 

$$ \Phi : \text{reflective subcategories} \; \rightleftarrows \; \text{favorable prefactorization systems} : \Psi. $$

Here subcategories form a (possibly [[large category|large]]) [[poset]] ordered by inclusion, and prefactorization systems form a poset ordered by inclusion of the right classes $M$.

The [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] is of this adjunction is easily seen to be an [[isomorphism]].  That is, given a reflective subcategory $A$, if we construct $(E,M)$ from it as above, then $A \simeq M/1$.  Therefore, the adjunction allows us to identify reflective subcategories with certain favorable prefactorization systems.

The prefactorization systems arising in this way --- equivalently, those for which $(E,M) = \Psi \Phi (E,M)$ --- are called the **reflective prefactorization systems**.  A **reflective factorization system** is a reflective prefactorization system which happens to be a factorization system.

More generally, for any favorable factorization system $(E,M)$, we have a reflective prefactorization system $\Psi \Phi (E,M)$, called the **reflective interior** of $(E,M)$.  Dualizing, it also has a **coreflective closure**.

## Properties

### Characterization

The following is Theorem 2.3 in [CHK](#CHK).

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $(E',M')$ be the reflective interior of $(E,M)$.  Then:

1. $f\in E'$ precisely when there exists a $g\in E$ such that $f g \in E$.
1. $(E,M)$ is reflective precisely when $f g\in E$ and $g\in E$ together imply $f\in E$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
That (1) implies (2) is obvious, so we prove (1).

Since $E'$ is, by definition, the class of maps inverted by the reflector into $M/1$, it satisfies the [[2-out-of-3 property]].  Since $E\subseteq E'$, it follows that $f g\in E$ and $g\in E$ imply $f\in E'$.

Conversely, if $f\colon X\to Y$ is in $E'$, then we have $\eta_Y \circ f = \ell(f) \circ \eta_X$ by naturality, where $\ell$ is the reflector into $M/1$ and $\eta$ its unit.  But by construction of $\ell$, $\eta_Y$ and $\eta_X$ are in $E$, and by assumption, $\ell(f)$ is invertible; hence we can take $g = \eta_Y$.

### Construction of factorizations

The following is a slightly generalized version of Corollary 3.4 from [CHK](#CHK).

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
Suppose that $C$ is finitely complete and $M$-complete for some factorization system $(E,M)$, where $M$ consists of monomorphisms and contains the split monics.  Then any reflective prefactorization system on $C$ is a factorization system.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
This follows directly from [this theorem](/nlab/show/M-complete+category#OFSFromAdjunction) applied to the reflection adjunction.

### Relation to localizations

For any favorable prefactorization system $(E,M)$, it is easy to show that $M/1$ is the [[localization]] of $C$ at $E$.  If $(E',M')$ is the reflective interior of $(E,M)$, then since $E'$ is the class of maps inverted by the reflector into $M/1$, it is precisely the *saturation* of $E$ in the sense of localization (the class of maps inverted by the localization at $E$).


## Examples

Obviously, any [[reflective subcategory]] gives rise to a reflective factorization system.  Here are a few examples.

* The category of complete [[metric spaces]] is reflective in the category of all metric spaces; the reflector is completion.  In the corresponding factorization system, $E$ is the class of [[dense subspace|dense embeddings]].

* Given a small [[site]] $S$, the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(S)$ is a reflective subcategory of the [[presheaf topos]] $Psh(S)$.  In the corresponding factorization system, $E$ is the class of [[local isomorphisms]].

On the other hand, many commonly encountered factorization systems are not reflective.

* The factorization system $(Epi, Mono)$ on [[Set]] is not reflective.  If  $(E',M')$ is its reflective interior, then $E'$ is the class of morphisms $e\colon X\to Y$ such that if $Y$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], so is $X$, while $M'$ is the class of morphisms $m\colon X\to Y$ such that if $X$ is inhabited, then $m$ is an isomorphism.
