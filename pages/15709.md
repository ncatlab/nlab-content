__Iwasawa polynomial__ is a number theoretic analogue of the [[Alexander polynomial]]. 

Relation between Alexander polynomial
and Lefschetz (spectral) zeta function
as analogous to the relation between Iwasawa polynomial
and p-adic analytic zeta function. See chapter 12 in

> A generator of the characteristic ideal of (the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer's subgroup) $Sel(X_\inf ,\rho)^\ast$, called
the twisted Iwasawa polynomial, is an analogue of the twisted Alexander polynomial.
