As a construction in [[Iwasawa theory]], the __Iwasawa polynomial__ is a number theoretic analogue of the [[Alexander polynomial]]. 

The relation between the Alexander polynomial
and the Lefschetz (spectral) zeta function
is analogous to that between the Iwasawa polynomial
and the p-adic analytic zeta function. See chapter 12 in

> A generator of the characteristic ideal of (the Pontryagin dual of the Selmer's subgroup) $Sel(X_\inf ,\rho)^\ast$, called
the twisted Iwasawa polynomial, is an analogue of the twisted Alexander polynomial.
