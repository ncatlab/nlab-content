## Definition

Let $K$ be a [[2-category]].

A [[morphism]] $f:A\to B$ in $K$ is called **(representably) fully-faithful** (or sometimes just **ff**) if for all [[object]]s $X \in K$ , the [[functor]]
$$K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$$
is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]].  


## Remarks

* Fully faithful morphisms in a 2-category may also be called **1-monic**, and be said to make their source into a **1-subobject** of their target.  See [[subcategory]] for some discussion.

* Fully faithful morphisms are often the right class of a [[factorization system in a 2-category|factorization system]].  The left class in $Cat$ consists of [[essentially surjective functors]]; in a [[regular 2-category]] it consists of the [[eso morphisms]].

* Just as in a 1-category any [[equalizer]] is [[monic]], in a 2-category any [[inverter]] or [[equifier]] is fully faithful.

## Variations

This is not always the "right" notion of fully-faithfulness in a 2-category.  In particular, in [[enriched category theory]] this definition does not recapture the correct notion of enriched fully-faithfulness.  It is possible, however, to characterize $V$-fully-faithful functors 2-categorically; see [[codiscrete cofibration]].

## Examples

In the [[2-category]] [[Cat]] the full and faithful morphisms are precisely the [[full and faithful functor]]s.
