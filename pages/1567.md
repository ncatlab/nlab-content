## Definition

A __distributive lattice__ is a [[lattice]] that satisfies the _distributivity laws_:

*  $x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)$,
*  $x \wedge (y \vee z) = (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z)$.

The nullary forms of distributivity follow automatically:

*  $x \vee \top = \top$,
*  $x \wedge \bot = \bot$.

Any lattice that satisfies one of the two binary distributivity laws must also satisfy the other; isn\'t that nice?  This convenience does *not* extend to infintary distributivity, however.

Distributive lattices and lattice [[homomorphisms]] form a [[concrete category]] [[DistLat]].


## Examples

Any [[Boolean algebra]], and even any [[Heyting algebra]], is a distributive lattice.

## Properties

Every distributive lattice, regarded as a [[category]], is a _[[coherent category]]_.

## Related concepts


A notion of extension of distributive lattices is  _[[canonical extension]]_.
