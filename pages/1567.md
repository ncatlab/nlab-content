A __distributive lattice__ is a [[lattice]] that satisfies the _distributivity laws_:

*  $x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)$,
*  $x \wedge (y \vee z) = (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z)$.

The nullary forms of distributivity follow automatically:

*  $x \vee \top = \top$,
*  $x \wedge \bot = \bot$.

Any lattice that satisfies one of the two binary distributivity laws must also satisfy the other; isn\'t that nice?  This convenience does *not* extend to infintary distributivity, however.


Any [[Boolean algebra]], and even any [[Heyting algebra]], is a distributive lattice.


Distributive lattices and lattice homomorphisms form a [[concrete category]] [[DistLat]].
