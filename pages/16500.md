## Idea

The concept of _equivalence of (2,1)-categories_ is the concept of [[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories]] restricted along the inclusion of [[(2,1)-categories]] into all [[(infinity,1)-categories]].

Equivalently, the concept of [[equivalence of 2-categories]] restricted along the inclusion of $(2,1)$-categories into [[2-categories]].

## Properties

Hence in the presence of the [[axiom of choice]], a [[(2,1)-functor]] $f \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is an equivalence precisely if 

1. it is essentially surjective, hence [[surjection|surjective]] on [[equivalence classes]] of [[objects]];

1. it is fully faithful in that for all objects $c_1,c_2\in \mathcal{C}$ the [[1-functor]] on [[hom-groupoids]] $f_{c_1,c_2}\colon \mathcal{C}(c_1,c_2) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}(f(c_1),f(c_2))$ is an [[equivalence of groupoids]].
