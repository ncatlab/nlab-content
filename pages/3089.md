## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **reflexive pair** is a [[parallel pair]] $f,g\colon A\rightrightarrows B$ having a common [[section]], i.e. a map $s\colon B\to A$ such that $f \circ s = g \circ s = 1_B$.  A **reflexive coequalizer** is a [[coequalizer]] of a reflexive pair.  A category **has reflexive coequalizers** if it has coequalizers of all reflexive pairs.

Dually, a reflexive coequalizer in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ is called a __coreflexive equalizer__ in $C$.

###### Remark

Reflexive coequalizers should not be confused with [[split coequalizers]], a distinct concept.

###### Example

Any [[congruence]] is a reflexive pair, so in particular any [[quotient object|quotient]] of a congruence is a reflexive coequalizer.

## Properties



+-- {: .num_theorem #LintonTheorem}
###### Theorem

If $T$ is a [[monad]] on a [[cocomplete category]] $C$, then the category $C^T$ of [[Eilenberg-Moore category|Eilenberg Moore algebras]] is cocomplete if and only if it has reflexive coequalizers.  This is the case particularly if $T$ preserves reflexive coequalizers.

=--

This is due to ([Linton](#Linton)).

+-- {: .num_prop #PreservingReflectiveCoequalizersInTwoVariables}
###### Proposition

If $F\colon C\times D\to E$ is a [[functor]] of two variables which preserves reflexive coequalizers in each variable separately (that is, $F(c,-)$ and $F(-,d)$ preserve reflexive coequalizers for all $c\in C$ and $d\in D$), then $F$ preserves reflexive coequalizers in both variables together.  

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is emphatically *not* the case for arbitrary coequalizers.

=--

This result is particularly interesting when $F$ is the [[tensor product]] of a cocomplete [[closed monoidal category]] $C$.  In this case it implies that the [[free monoid monad]] on such a category preserves reflexive coequalizers, and thus (by [Linton's theorem](#LintonTheorem)) the category of [[monoid objects]] in $C$ is cocomplete. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Reflexive coequalizers in [[Set]] commute with finite [[products]]: 

the $n$-fold product functors $Set^n \stackrel{\prod}{\to} Set$ preserve reflexive coequalizers. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows from prop. \ref{PreservingReflectiveCoequalizersInTwoVariables} as well as from the fact that the [[diagram]] category $\{ 0 \stackrel{\overset{d_0}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{s_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{d_1}{\to}}} 1\}$ with $d_0 \circ s_0 = d_1 \circ s_0 = id$ is a [[sifted category]].

=--

Of course, the diagonal functor $\Delta: Set \to Set^n$, being [[left adjoint]] to the product functor, preserves reflexive coequalizers; therefore the composite 

$$Set \stackrel{\prod \Delta}{\to} Set: x \mapsto \hom(n, x)$$ 

also preserves reflexive coequalizers. 

This has a further consequence which is technically very convenient: 

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $T$ is a [[finitary monad]] on $Set$, then $T$ preserves reflexive coequalizers.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have a [[coend]] formula for $T$: 

$$T(-) \cong \int^{n \in Fin} T(n) \times \hom(n, -)$$ 

and since this is a colimit of functors $\hom(n, -)$ which preserve reflexive coequalizers, $T$ must also preserve reflexive coequalizers.
