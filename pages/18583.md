__$Inj$__ (or __$Set_inj$__) is the [[wide subcategory]] of the [[topos]] [[Set]] with its [[morphisms]] restricted to [[monomorphism|monomorphisms]] ([[injective function]]s).

*  $Inj$'s   [[arrow category]], $Inj^\to$, is the  [[quasitopos#mono]] [[M-category#mono|Mono]]  of set monomorphisms which is a  [[reflective subcategory]] of the [[category of presheaves|presheaf topos]] $Set^{\to}$ (the [[Sierpinski topos]].)  It is the category of [[separated presheaves]] for the [[double negation#topology|double negation topology]] on $Set^\to$.

* For a set $S$, its [[power set]] ($\mathcal{P}S$ or $2^S$) is the [[slice category]] $Inj/S$ which has  objects that are injections to $S$ and morphisms that are injections of injections that form commuting triangles.  $2^S$ is a
quasitopos because it is a  [[Heyting algebra]].
