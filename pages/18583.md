__$Inj$__ (or __$Set_inj$__) is the [[wide subcategory]] of the [[topos]] [[Set]] with its [[morphisms]] restricted to [[monomorphism|monomorphisms]] ([[injective function]]s).

*  The [[arrow category]] $Inj^\to$ of $Inj$ is, in turn, a [[wide subcategory]] of the [[quasitopos#mono]] [[M-category#mono|Mono]] of set monomorphisms.  The two categories have the same objects, namely injective functions, but in [[Mono]] the morphism are arbitrary commutative squares from one injection to another, whereas in $Inj^\to$ the other two arrows in the commutative square must also be injective.  Note that $Mono$ is a [[reflective subcategory]] of the [[category of presheaves|presheaf topos]] $Set^{\to}$ (the [[Sierpinski topos]]), and the category of [[separated presheaves]] for the [[double negation#topology|double negation topology]] on $Set^\to$.

* For a set $S$, its [[power set]] ($\mathcal{P}S$ or $2^S$) is the [[slice category]] $Inj/S$ which has  objects that are injections to $S$ and morphisms that are injections of injections that form commuting triangles.  $2^S$ is a
quasitopos because it is a  [[Heyting algebra]].
