#Definition#

_Horizontal categorification_ or _Oidification_ 
describes the process by which 

 1. a concept is realized to be equivalent to a certain type of category with a _single object_;

 2. and then this concept is generalized -- or oidified -- by passing to instances of such types of categories with more than one object.

#Remarks#

* This is to be contrasted with [[vertical categorification]].

* It can be argued that the term 'categorification' should be reserved for [[vertical categorification]], since we can use 'oidification' for the horizontal concept.

* It has rightly been remarked that groupoids are more fundamental than groups, algebroids are more fundamental than algebras, etc. Hence in a better world, the suffix would be characterizing the one-object special cases, not the general concepts.

#Examples#

* The horizontal categorification of groups are [[groupoid]]s: categories in which every morphism is invertible.

* The horizontal categorification of algebras are _algebroids_: [[internal category|internal categories]] in the category of vector spaces.

* The horizontal categorification of rings are [[ringoid]]s: [[internal category|internal categories]] in the category of abelian groups. ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/09/ringoids.html))

* The horizontal categorification of $C^*$-algebras hence ought to be known as _$C^*$--algebroids_  but is usually known as [[C*-category|C*-categories]].

* Since, by the Gelfand theorem, $C^*$-algebras are dual to topological spaces, Paolo Bertozzini et. al proposed to define [[spaceoid]]s to be entities dual to $C^*$-categories ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/spaceoids.html)).

* And finally the **exception from the rule**: a many-object [[monoid]] is _not_ called a _monoidoid_ -- but is called a [[category]]! :-)
