## Idea

The _Randall-Sumdrum model_ ([Randall-Sundrum 99a](#RandallSundrum99a), [99b](#RandallSundrum99b)) is a class of [[model (physics)|models]] in combined [[cosmology]] and [[particle physics]], which assume that the [[observable universe]] constitutes the [[asymptotic boundary]] of an ambient [[anti de Sitter spacetime]]: the [[force]] of [[gravity]] would pertain to the full [[anti de Sitter spacetime|anti de sitter]] "[[bulk]]" [[spacetime]], but the [[gauge fields]] and [[fermion field|fermion]] [[matter fields]] would be constrained to reside on that boundary, as would hence be all observations made via [[electromagnetic radiation]] by [[observer]] inside this cosmology.

Hence the extra [[bulk]] [[dimensions]] in these models need not be small (technically: the [[fiber]] spaces need not be [[compact topological spaces]] with tiny [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[volume]]) in order to be unobservable for [[observers]]. This is in contrast to the (historically much older) [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] models for [[physics]] with extra [[dimensions]]. Therefore Randall-Sumdrum-like models are also referred to as _large extra dimension models_.

One original motivation for the RS-models was the idea that this setup could address the [[hierarchy problem]].

Something at least close to Randall-Sundrum models naturally appears in [[string phenomenology]]: In [[intersecting D-brane models]] the [[standard model of particle physics]] is part of the [[worldvolume]] [[quantum field theory]] of [[D6-branes]] [[intersection|intersected]] to a 3+1-dimensional subspace. By the general lore of [[black holes in string theory]], [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbatively]] these [[D6-branes]] are [[black branes]] with [[anti de Sitter spacetime|anti de Sitter]] [[near horizon geometry]]. Hence the [[cosmology]] of [[intersecting D-brane models]] is qualitatively of Randall-Sundrum form, even if details may differ. For the quick idea see [Teraguchi 07, around slide 21](#Teraguchi07), for review and further pointers see [Uranga 02, section 18](#Uranga02)
