## Definition

A **symmetric bicategory** is a [[bicategory]] $B$ equipped with a bijective-on-objects biequivalence $t \colon B \sim B^{\text{op}}$.

A **closed symmetric bicategory** is a symmetric bicategory that is [[closed bicategory|closed]].

## Remarks

A symmetric bicategory is a [[horizontal categorification]] of a [[symmetric monoidal category]]. It is not to be confused with a symmetric [[monoidal bicategory]], which is a [[vertical categorification]] of the same concept.

Note, however, that one-object symmetric bicategories are more expressive than symmetric monoidal categories: a symmetric bicategory with a single object $A$ is a symmetric monoidal category if and only if $t$ is the identity.

## Examples

- [[Prof]] is a closed symmetric bicategory, whose involution is induced by the [[duality involution]] on [[Cat]].
