Torsor is a synonym of [[principal bundle|principal bundle]]. While terminology principal bundle is usually used in the setting of topological spaces, torsors are traditionally used in the setting of Grothendieck topologies (faithfully flat and etale topology in particular), topoi and for generalization in various categorical setups; while in topology in phrase $G$-principal bundle $G$ is usually a group(oid), when we say $G$-torsor, $G$ is usually a (pre)sheaf of group(oid)s, or $G$ is a plain category (not a groupoid).
