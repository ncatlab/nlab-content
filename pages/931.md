A __torsor__ is often the same a [[principal bundle]]. While the terminology 'principal bundle' is usually used in the setting of [[topological space]]s, torsors are traditionally used in the setting of [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] (faithfully flat and étale topology in particular), [[topos|topoi]] and for generalizations in various category-theoretic setups. While in the phrase ‘$G$-principal bundle' $G$ is usually a [[group]] or [[groupoid]], when we say ‘$G$-torsor', $G$ is usually a [[presheaf]] or [[sheaf]] of group(oid)s, or $G$ is a plain [[category]] (not a groupoid).

A __torsor__ of a group $G$, without any base space given, can also simply be an inhabited transitive $G$-[[action|set]], which is the same as a principal $G$-bundle over the [[point]].
