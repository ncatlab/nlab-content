## Idea

In the context of [[analytic geometry]], a **polydisc** is a [[product]] of [[discs]]: the [[analytic space]] which is [[Isbell duality|formally dual]] to the [[Tate algebra]] $T_n$ (for an $n$-dimensional polydisk).

This is a basic [[analytic space]]. It is the analog in [[analytic geometry]] of the [[affine space]] $\mathbb{A}^n$ in [[algebraic geometry]]. 

Every [[complex analytic manifold]] is [[covering|locally]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a polydisk.
