## Idea

### General

In the context of [[rigid analytic geometry|rigid]] [[analytic geometry]], a **polydisc** is a [[product]] of [[discs]]: the [[analytic space]] which is [[Isbell duality|formally dual]] to the [[Tate algebra]] $T_n$ (for an $n$-dimensional polydisk).

This is a basic [[analytic space]]. It is the analog in [[analytic geometry]] of the [[affine space]] $\mathbb{A}^n$ in [[algebraic geometry]]. 

Those [[analytic spaces]] which are subspaces of polydiscs are called _[[affinoids]]_.

### In complex analytic geometry
 {#InComplexAnalyticGeometry}

Specifically in [[complex analytic geometry]] a polydsic is a sub-[[complex manifold]] of a [[product]] of [[complex planes]]

$$
  D \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^n
$$

of the form


$$
  D = D_{\delta_1, \cdots, \delta_n}
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    (z_1, \cdots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n | {\vert z_i\vert \lt \delta_i}
  \right\}
$$

for $\delta_i \in (0,\infty]$.

e.g. ([Maddock, p.6](#Maddock))

Every [[complex analytic manifold]] is [[covering|locally]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a complex polydisc, in that it may be covered by [[open subsets]] which are [[biholomorphism|biholomorphic]] to complex polydiscs. e.g. ([Maddock, p. 7](#Maddock)).

In fact ([Fornæss-Stout 77a, lemma II.1](#FornaessStout77a)) states that every [[connected topological space|connected]] and [[second countable topological space|second countable]] [[complex manifold]] may already be [[cover|covered]] by [[finite number|finitely]] many [[open subsets]] [[biholomorphism|biholomorphic]] to a polydisc.
