## Idea

A special kind of [[gauge fixing]] condition on a [[connection on a bundle]]. 

## Definition

Let $X = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}$ a product [[manifold]] and let $t : X \to \mathbb{R}$ be the projection on the last factor.

For $A$ a [[connection on a bundle]] on $X$, a _temporal gauge_ is a gauge in which

$$
  A_{\partial_t} = 0
  \,.
$$
