Pilar Carrasco Carrasco is a Spanish mathematician and expert on homotopical and homological algebra, especially with regard to [[crossed modules]] and their higher dimensional analogues. In particular she is an expert on simplicial groups and their structure, and showed a version of the Dold-Kan correspondence between simplicial groups and [[hypercrossed complex]]es.
