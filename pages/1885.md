The **Moore space** $M(G, n)$, where $G$ is an abelian group and $n \geq 1$, is a space which has non-trivial (reduced) [[homology]] group $G$ only in dimension $n$. There is also a cohomology analogue known as a **co-Moore space**, but this is not defined for all abelian $G$. [[sphere|Spheres]] are both Moore and co-Moore spaces for $G = \mathbb{Z}$.

Co-Moore spaces are the [[Eckmann-Hilton duality|Eckmann–Hilton duals]] of [[Eilenberg–Mac Lane spaces]]. 

According to Baues, Moore spaces are $H \pi$-duals to Eilenberg--Mac Lane spaces. This leads to an extensive duality for connected [[CW complexes]].

Just as there is a [[Postnikov decomposition]] of a space as a tower of fibrations, so there is a [[Moore decomposition]] as a tower of cofibrations.
