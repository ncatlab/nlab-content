## Idea

Certain [[Grothendieck topologies]] on a category with an [[initial object]] can be presented by a very simple structure called a _cd-structure_.  

A [[Grothendieck topology]] is "completely decomposable" if it is generated by [[covering families]] consisting of [[pairs]] of maps which are part of a distinguished [[commuting square]]. The collection of these distinguished squares is then called a "cd-structure".

The [[descent]]-condition for [[simplicial presheaves]] (their [[infinity-stack|$\infty$-stack]]-condition) over completely decomposable topologies may be expressed by a [[Brown-Gersten property]], hence a generalized [Mayer-Vietoris property](Whitehead-generalized+cohomology#MayerVietorisSequenceInGeneralizedCohomology), which essentially says that a simplicial presheaf takes distinguished squares to [[homotopy pullback]]-squares. Typically this is much easier to check than the generic (homotopy-)descent condition.

###### Definition
A *cd-structure* $\chi$ on a [[category]] $C$ with an [[initial object]] is a class of [[commutative squares]] which is stable by isomorphism.
We will call its elements **$\chi$-distinguished squares**.
=--

## Properties

Any cd-structure gives rise in a canonical way to a [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $\chi$ be a cd-structure on $C$.  The associated [[Grothendieck topology]] $\tau_\chi$ on $C$ is the coarsest topology such that:

* the empty sieve covers $\emptyset_C$, the initial object of $C$;
* $\{ b \to d, c \to d \}$ generates a covering sieve for all $\chi$-distinguished squares
$$
\begin{matrix}
  a& \to & b \\
  \downarrow& &\, \downarrow p\\
  c &\underset{j}{\to} & d
\end{matrix}
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A cd-structure $\chi$ is called **complete** if every [[morphism]] whose target is an [[initial object]] of $C$ is an isomorphism, and if it is stable by [[base change]] along arbitrary morphisms of $C$.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A cd-structure $\chi$ is called **regular** if (i) each $\chi$-distinguished square $Q$ is [[cartesian square|cartesian]], (ii) the lower horizontal morphism $j : c \to d$ is a [[monomorphism]], and (iii) for each $Q \in \chi$, the induced commutative square
$$
\begin{matrix}
  a& \to & b \\
  \downarrow& &\, \downarrow\\
  a \times_c a &\to & b \times_d b
\end{matrix}
$$
belongs to $\chi$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
Let $\chi$ be a complete cd-structure.  If $F$ is an [[(∞,1)-presheaf]] on $C$ that maps initial objects of $C$ to terminal objects, and sends $\chi$-distinguished squares to [[cartesian squares]], then $F$ is a $\tau_\chi$-[[(∞,1)-sheaf]].

If $\chi$ is further regular, then the converse is also true.
=--

For presheaves of *sets*, this is [Voevodsky 2010, Lem. 2.9 and Prop. 2.15](#Voevodsky10). For general (∞,1)-presheaves, this is a rephrasing of [Voevodsky 2010, Cor. 5.10](#Voevodsky10).

## Examples

There are various interesting cd-structures on the category of [[schemes]] over a base $S$, which give rise to [[Grothendieck topologies]] like 

* the [[Zariski topology]]. Here a square is distinguished iff the cospan part formed by [[open embeddings]], which together form an [[open cover]], and the square is a [[pullback square]].

* the [[Nisnevich topology]]; 

* the [[cdh topology]].
