## Definition

A __possibly empty left group__ is a [[possibly empty loop|possibly empty left loop]] $(G,\backslash)$ such that for all $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $G$, $(a\backslash b)\backslash c= b\backslash ((a\backslash (a\backslash a))\backslash c)$. 

A __possibly empty right group__ is a [[possibly empty loop|possibly empty right loop]] $(G,/)$ such that for all $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $G$, $a/(b/c)=(a/((c/c)/c)/b$

A __possibly empty group__ is a [[possibly empty loop]] $(G,\backslash,/)$ that is also a possibly empty left group and a possibly empty right group. 

## Examples

* Every [[group]] is a possibly empty group. 

* The empty possibly empty group is an possibly empty group that is not a group. 

* And that is about it.

* An possibly empty group object in the category of [[pointed sets]] can be made into a [[heap]].
