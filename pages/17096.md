This page accompanies [this nForum thread](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/6896/poincare-conjecture/). I recommend that the nForum thread be read first; as explained there, the purpose of this page is to provide a convenient reference, written formally, for the mathematics discussed in the nForum thread. Motivation, discussion, and other exposition will be given in the nForum thread.

Anybody is welcome to edit this page. However, I ask that any contribution not made by myself (Richard Williamson) be separated, in the first instance at least, from the contributions that I make; and that this be indicated. This is principally to make the correspondence between the nForum thread and this page as clear and as simple as possible. 

As with the nForum thread, all questions, comments, and other contributions are welcome. For anything of a significant nature, it would probably be best to  open a discussion either at the nForum or over email (richard (at) rwilliamson-mathematics.info), but I leave it to your discretion.

## Link diagrams ##

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Notation

Let $\Gamma$ be a graph. We denote the set of vertices of $\Gamma$ by $V(\Gamma)$, and denote the set of edges of $\Gamma$ by $E(\Gamma)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A _link diagram_ consists of the following data.

1. A graph $\Gamma$. 
1. A map $\mathsf{decoration} : V(\Gamma) \rightarrow \{\emptyset, +, -\}$.
1. For every vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$ for which $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$ or $-$, a 4-tuple $\big( n(v), s(v), e(v), w(v) \big)$ of edges of $\Gamma$. 

Given a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$ for which $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$ or $-$, we require that exactly one vertex of each of $n(v)$, $s(v)$, $e(v)$, and $w(v)$ is $v$, and that no other edge of $\Gamma$ has $v$ as one of its vertices.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

In other words, a link diagram is a graph $\Gamma$, each 4-valent vertex of which may be (but need not be) decorated with one of the two symbols $+$ or $-$. It is convenient for us to express this by requiring that every vertex be decorated by one of the three symbols $\emptyset$, $+$, or $-$, decoration by $\emptyset$ being thought of as no decoration.

It is important that an ordering be chosen, once and for all, of the four edges meeting at every decorated (with $+$ or $-$) 4-valent vertex of $\Gamma$. This is built into the definition above.

###### Definition

A link diagram $L$ is _classical_ if the following hold, denoting the underlying graph of $L$ by $\Gamma$.

1. For every vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, we have that $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$ or $-$.

2. There is an embedding of $\Gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that, for every vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, the image of the edges $n(v)$, $e(v)$, $s(v)$, and $w(v)$ is, up to planar isotopy, as in the figure in [this file](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/embedding_of_crossing.pdf).

###### Remark

A classical link diagram, in the sense of the above definition, is exactly a link diagram in the usual/classical sense, or, more precisely, one of the possible usual/classical senses.

Indeed, a link diagram in the usual/classical sense consists of a 4-valent planar graph together with data which one can associate to a link (in general position) when taking a projection of it to a 4-valent planar graph; and which is sufficient to allow the link to be recovered from this projection together with its additional data. 
 
The projection of any link $L$ (in general position) to a 4-valent planar graph satisfies the second criterion of the previous definition for exactly one choice of ordering of the set $\{ n(v), s(v), w(v), e(v) \}$, that is to say, determines the 4-tuple $\big( n(v), s(v), w(v), e(v) \big)$. We decorate $v$ by $+$ (respectively $-$) if the arc of $L$ giving rise to $n(v)$ and $s(v)$ lies above (respectively below) the arc of $L$ giving rise to $w(v)$ and $e(v)$. Here 'above' and 'below' are with respect, of course, to the choice of direction which we made when projecting $L$ to a 4-valent planar graph. 

Given this procedure for passing from a link to a (classical) link diagram, we can clearly re-construct a link uniquely (up to isotopy) from a link diagram together with the data of 1. and 2. as in the previous definition.

###### Terminology

Let $L$ be a link diagram. An _arc_ of $L$ is an $n$-tuple $(e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n})$ of edges of the underlying graph of $L$ such that the following hold.

1. For each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the edges $e_{i}$ and $e_{i+1}$ have exactly one vertex in common. Otherwise, no two edges in this $n$-tuple share a common vertex. 
1. Let $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ be an integer for which the vertex $v$ which $e_{i}$ and $e_{i+1}$ share is 4-valent. If $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ isÂ $+$, then $\{n(v),s(v)\} = \{e_i, e_{i+1}\}$. If $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $-$, then $\{w(v),e(v)\} = \{e_i, e_{i+1}\}$.  
1. The vertex $v$ of $e_{1}$ which is not a vertex of $e_{2}$ is 4-valent, and has decoration $+$ or $-$. If $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$, then $e_{1}$ is $e(v)$ or $w(v)$. If $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $-$, then $e_{1}$ is $n(v)$ or $s(v)$. 
1. The vertex of $e_{n}$ which is not a vertex of $e_{n-1}$ is 4-valent, and has decoration $+$ or $-$. If $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$, then $e_{1}$ is $e(v)$ or $w(v)$. If $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $-$, then $e_{1}$ is $n(v)$ or $s(v)$.
1. With the exception of the vertex of 3. and the vertex of 4., every vertex of this arc, that is to say, each vertex of $e_{i}$, for every $1 \leq i \leq n$, is either 2-valent, 3-valent, or 4-valent.

###### Remark

The second condition captures the fact that an arc of a classical link diagram can include as part of it the 'over arc' of a crossing (or 'over arcs' of several crossings), but not either half of an 'under arc' of a crossing.

The third and fourth conditions capture the fact that an arc of a classical link diagram begins and ends at half of an 'under arc' of a crossing.

The fifth condition is technical, and imposed only to simplify one aspect of the argument to come. It is almost certainly not strictly needed. It is necessary to allow both 2-valent and 3-valent vertices (the notion of an arc will be important to us in the case of certain non-classical link diagrams admitting 2-valent and 3-valent vertices).
