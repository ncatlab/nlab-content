## Abstract

We present a short and simple (modulo those foundational results on closed, connected, orientable 3-manifolds which allow for these to be viewed diagramatically, as framed links up to local Kirby moves and the framed Reidemeister moves) proof of the Poincaré conjecture, by means of a certain quotient of the free group on the arcs of a link diagram.

## Preliminaries ##

### Kirby equivalence ###

The _framed Reidemeister moves_ on a link diagram are depicted [here](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/poincare_conjecture/nforum/framed_reidemeister_moves.pdf).

The _Kirby moves_ on a link diagram are depicted [here](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/poincare_conjecture/nforum/kirby_moves.pdf)

A pair of link diagrams are _Kirby equivalent_ if there is a finite sequence of framed Reidemeister moves and Kirby moves taking one to the other.

### Fundamental theorems on 3-manifolds

We shall rely on the following fundamental theorems, which allow for a diagrammatic approach to the Poincaré conjecture.

###### Theorem (Lickorish-Wallace)

Let $M$ be a closed, connected, orientable 3-manifold. There is a link diagram $L$ such that $M$ is isomorphic to the 3-manifold obtained by the integral Dehn surgery on $L$ in $S^{3}$ with respect to the blackboard framing of $L$.

###### Theorem (Kirby)

Let $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$ be closed, connected, orientable 3-manifolds. Let $L_{0}$ (respectively $L_{1}$) be a link diagram such that the 3-manifold obtained by the integral Dehn surgery on $L_{0}$ (respectively $L_{1}$) in $S^{3}$ with respect to the blackboard framing of $L_{0}$ (respectively $L_{1}$). Then $M_{0}$ is isomorphic to $M_{1}$ if and only if $L_{0}$ and $L_{1}$ are Kirby equivalent.

### Fundamental group of a link diagram 

Let $L$ be a link diagram, with some choice of orientation. We denote the free group on the arcs of $L$ by $F(L)$. 

We define $\pi_{1}(L)$, the fundamental group of $L$, to be the quotient of $F(L)$ by the normal subgroup generated by words of the form $a_3 a_2^{-1} a_1^{-1} a_2$, for any crossing of $L$ as depicted [here](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/poincare_conjecture/nforum/labelled_crossing.pdf).

### Longitude of the component of a link diagram 

Let $L$ be a link diagram, with some choice of orientation. The longitude of a component of $L$ is defined to be the word $w$ which we obtain after carrying out the following procedure. 

1. Pick any arc of $L$, say $a$. Let $w$ be the empty word.
2. Walk around $L$, following the orientation. When we walk under an arc $b$, whether or not $b$ belongs to same component of $L$ or a different one, we add $b$ to the end of $w$ if the configuration of orientations at the crossing is as depicted in the first figure [here](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/poincare_conjecture/nforum/longitude_add.pdf), and add $b^{-1}$ to the end of $w$ if the configuration of orientations at the crossing is as depicted in the second figure [here](http://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/poincare_conjecture/nforum/longitude_add_inverse.pdf).
3. Stop when we return to the arc we started with, namely $a$.

The following is a consequence of the van Kampen theorem.

###### Proposition

Let $M$ be a closed, connected, orientable 3-manifold. Let $L$ be a link diagram such that the 3-manifold obtained by the integral Dehn surgery on $L$ in $S^{3}$ with respect to the blackboard framing of $L$ is isomorphic to $M$. Then the group $\pi_{1}(M)$ is isomorphic to the group $\pi_{1}(L) / \langle l_1, \ldots, l_n \rangle$, where $l_1$, $\ldots$, $l_{n}$ are the longitudes of the components of $L$, and $\langle l_1, \ldots, l_n \rangle$ is the normal subgroup generated by these.

### Diagrammatic formulation Poincaré conjecture

Let $M$ be a closed, connected $3$-manifold. The _Poincaré conjecture_ is that if $\pi_{1}(M)$ is trivial (that is to say, isomorphic to a group with one element), then $M$ is isomorphic to $S^{3}$. 

If $\pi_{1}(M)$ is trivial, then $M$ is orientable. It thus follows from the Lickorish-Wallace theorem, the Kirby theorem, the preceding proposition, and the fact that integral Dehn surgery on the empty link diagram gives $S^{3}$, that the Poincaré conjecture is equivalent to the following: if a link diagram $L$ has the property that the group $\pi_{1}(L) / \langle l_1, \ldots, l_n \rangle$ is trivial, then $L$ is Kirby equivalent to the empty link diagram.

## Dénouement ##

We present the conclusion of our argument first. Afterwards, we will present the missing pieces.

Let $L$ be a link diagram, and let $F(L)$ be the free group on the arcs of $L$. Suppose that we have defined a normal subgroup $N$ of $F(L)$ with the following properties.

1. The group $F(L) / N$ is a quotient of the group $\pi_{1} / \langle l_1, \ldots, l_n \rangle$.

2. Let $a$ be an arc of $L$. If $a$ belongs to $N$, then $L$ is Kirby equivalent to a link diagram with strictly fewer components. 

We can then carry out the following inductive argument.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the Poincaré conjecture

Suppose that  $\pi_{1} / \langle l_1, \ldots, l_n \rangle$ is trivial. Then, by 1., we have that $F(L) / N$ is trivial. Hence every element of $F(L)$ belongs to $N$. 

Let $a$ be any arc of $L$. By the preceding observation, we have that $a$ belongs to $N$. By 2.,we deduce that $L$ is Kirby equivalent to a link diagram $L'$ with strictly fewer components. 

Since $L'$ is Kirby equivalent to $L$, we have that $\pi_{1}(L') / \langle l'_1, \ldots, l'_n' \rangle$, where $l'_1$, $\ldots$, $l'_n'$ are the longitudes of the components of $L'$, is isomorphic to $\pi_{1} / \langle l_1, \ldots, l_n \rangle$. Since the latter is trivial, we deduce that $\pi_{1}(L') / \langle l'_1, \ldots, l'_n' \rangle$ is trivial. Thus we can give the same argument for $L'$ as we did for $L$.

In this way, we obtain a sequence $L$, $L'$, $\ldots$ of link diagrams, all Kirby equivalent to $L$, and such that each link diagram appearing has strictly fewer components than the link diagram immediately preceding it. By induction, we conclude that $L$ is Kirby equivalent to the empty link diagram.
