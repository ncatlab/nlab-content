This page accompanies [this nForum thread](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/6896/poincare-conjecture/). I recommend that the nForum thread be read first; as explained there, the purpose of this page is to provide a convenient reference, written formally, for the mathematics discussed in the nForum thread. Motivation, discussion, and other exposition will be given in the nForum thread.

Anybody is welcome to edit this page. However, I ask that any contribution not made by myself (Richard Williamson) be separated, in the first instance at least, from the contributions that I make; and that this be indicated. This is principally to make the correspondence between the nForum thread and this page as clear and as simple as possible. 

As with the nForum thread, all questions, comments, and other contributions are welcome. For anything of a significant nature, it would probably be best to  open a discussion either at the nForum or over email (richard (at) rwilliamson-mathematics.info), but I leave it to your discretion.

## Link diagrams ##

###### Notation

Let $\Gamma$ be a graph. We denote the set of vertices of $\Gamma$ by $V(\Gamma)$, and denote the set of edges of $\Gamma$ by $E(\Gamma)$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A _link diagram_ consists of the following data.

1. A graph $\Gamma$. 
1. A map $\mathsf{decoration} : V(\Gamma) \rightarrow \{\emptyset, +, -\}$.
1. For every vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$ for which $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$ or $-$, a 4-tuple $\big( n(v), s(v), e(v), w(v) \big)$ of edges of $\Gamma$. 

Given a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$ for which $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$ or $-$, we require that exactly one vertex of each of $n(v)$, $s(v)$, $e(v)$, and $w(v)$ is $v$, and that no other edge of $\Gamma$ has $v$ as one of its vertices.

###### Remark

In other words, a link diagram is a graph $\Gamma$, each 4-valent vertex of which may be (but need not be) decorated with one of the two symbols $+$ or $-$. It is convenient for us to express this by requiring that every vertex be decorated by one of the three symbols $\emptyset$, $+$, or $-$, decoration by $\emptyset$ being thought of as no decoration.

It is important that an ordering be chosen, once and for all, of the four edges meeting at every decorated (with $+$ or $-$) 4-valent vertex of $\Gamma$. This is built into the definition above.

###### Notation

We denote the set of link diagrams by $\mathsf{Link}$ $\mathsf{Diagrams}$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A link diagram is _classical_ if $\Gamma$ is planar and if, for every vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, we have that $\mathsf{decoration}(v)$ is $+$ or $-$.

###### Remark

A classical link diagram, in the sense of the above definition, is exactly a link diagram in the usual/classical sense.
