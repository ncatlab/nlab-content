## Idea

Hellman-Feynman theorem relates the time derivative of energy in [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system with the expectation value of the time derivative of the Hamiltonian operator.

It is a consequence of the variational principle, hence it is valid not only to true eigenstates but also for some other wave functions (e.g. Hartree-Fock) steming from the variational principle.
