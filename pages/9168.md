## Idea

In [[physics]], a __scalar field__ is a [[field (physics)|field]] on [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] which is simply a [[function]] with values in the [[field of scalars]], typically the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ or [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, somtimes the [[quaternions]] $\mathbb{H}$. More generally, one still speaks of a "scalar field" if it takes values in $k^n$ for $k \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}\}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 

Scalar fields serve as a key toy example in theoretical studies of [[field theory]], such as in [[phi^4 theory]] or in the [[Ising model]].  One fundamental scalar field is experimentally known, the _[[Higgs field]]_, which is one component of the [[standard model of particle physics]]. A widely hypothesized scalar field is the [[inflaton]] field in [[model (physics)|models]] of [[cosmic inflation]], which however remains speculative and might in any case be an effective compound of more fundamental fields.

### Free scalar field

#### As a classical local field

Recall that a _[[classical field theory|classical]] [[local field theory]]_ is for some prescribed class of [[manifolds]] $X$ of given [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ interpreted as [[spacetimes]]/[[worldvolumes]]:

1. a choice of [[fiber bundle]] $E \to X$, called the _[[field bundle]]_;

1. a choice $L \in \Omega^{n,0}(J^\infty(E))$ of [[horizontal differential form]] of degree $n$ on the [[jet bundle]] of the field bundle, called the _[[local Lagrangian density]]_.

###### Definition
**(free scalar field as a classical local field theory)**

As a [[classical field theory|classical]] [[local field theory|local field]] the _relativistic [[free field|free]] scalar field_ in [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$  is

* for each [[globally hyperbolic spacetime|globally hyperbolic]] [[orientation|oriented]] and [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[spacetime]] $(X,e)$ ($X$ a [[smooth manifold]], $e$ a [[pseudo-orthogonal structure]]/[[vielbein]]  inducing a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] $g$)

1. the [[field bundle]] given by the [[trivial line bundle]] $X \times k \overset{pr_1}{\to} X$ over $X$;

1. the [[local Lagrangian density]] $L \in \Omega^{n,0}(J^\infty_X(X \times k))$ (a [[horizontal differential form]] on the [[jet bundle]] of the [[trivial line bundle]] over $X$) given by

   $$
     L \;\coloneqq\; \vert \nabla \phi\vert^2 dvol
   $$

   where

   1. $\vert \nabla \phi\vert^2$ denotes the [[norm]] square of the first order jets with respect to the given [[metric]] $g$, hence in a local [[coordinate chart]] $J^\infty(E\vert_U) \coloneqq \left\{ \{x^\mu\}, \phi, \{\phi_{,\mu} \cdots\} \right\}$ of $J^\infty(X \times k)$ the function 

      $$
        \vert \nabla \phi\vert^2\vert_{J^{\infty}(E\vert_U)} 
          \;=\; 
        g^{\mu \nu} \phi_{,\mu} \phi_{,\nu}
      $$

   1. $dvol$ denotes the [[volume form]] of $(X,e)$, canonically regarded as a [[horizontal differential form]] on $J^\infty(X \times k)$.

=--

Recall that given a [[classical field theory|classical]] [[local field theory]] defined by a [[local Lagrangian density]] $L \in \Omega^{n,0}(J^\infty(E))$, then

1. the [[configuration space]] is the [[smooth space]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[sections]]  $\Gamma_X(E)$ of the [[field bundle]];

1. the [[equations of motion]] is the [[partial differential equation]] on elements $\phi \in \Gamma_X(E)$ given by

   $$
     (\delta_{EL} L)(j^\infty \phi) = 0
     \,,
   $$

   where 

   1. $\delta_{EL} \;\colon\; \Omega^{n,0}(J^\infty_X(E)) \to \mathcal{F}^1(J^\infty_X(E))$ denotes the _[[Euler-Lagrange operator]]_

   1. $j^\infty \;\colon\; \Gamma_X(E) \longrightarrow \Gamma_X(J^\infty_X(E))$ denotes [[jet prolongation]].

1. The [[covariant phase space]] $(Sol_{\delta_{EL}L = 0}, d\theta)$ is the subspace $Sol_{\delta_{EL} L = 0} \subset \Gamma_X(E)$ of solutions to the [[equations of motion]], equipped with the canonical [[presymplectic form]].

   For a field theory without [[gauge symmetries]] such as scalar field theory, the covariant phase space is already [[reduced phase space|reduced]] and the canonical presymplectic form is hence a [[symplectic form]]. Its inverse hence defines a [[Poisson bracket]].

###### Proposition

The [[equation of motion]] of the free scalar field (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianOfFreeScalarField}) is the [[wave equation]]

$$
  \Box_g \phi = 0
  \,,
$$

on the given [[spacetime]] $(X,g)$.

This equation admits both an advanced and a retarded [[Green's functions]]
$$
  \Delta_S^{A/R}
    \;\colon\;
  C^\infty_c(X)
    \longrightarrow
  C^\infty(X)
  \,.

###### Definition
**(point evaluation [[observables]])**

For $x \in X$, write

$$
  \Phi(x)
    \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_X(X \times k)
    \longrightarrow
  k
$$

for the [[smooth function]] ([[functional]] which evaluates the scalar field at $x \in X$):

$$
  \Phi(x) \;\colon\; \phi \mapsto \phi(x)
  \,.

###### Proposition

The induced [[Poisson bracket]] on the [[covariant phase space]] of the free scalar field (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianOfFreeScalarField}) is given on point evaluation observables $\Phi$ (def. \ref{PointEvaluation}) by

$$
  \{\Phi(x), \Phi(y)\}
    \;=\;
  \Delta_S(x,y)  
  \,,
$$


where  

$$
  \Delta_S(x,y)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \Delta_S^R(x,y)
   -
  \Delta_S^A(x,y)
$$

is the _[[causal propagator]]_ , namely the difference between the retarded and the advanced [[Green's function]] from prop. \ref{FreeScalarFieldEOMAndGreensFunctions}.

###### Definition

By [this prop.](Peierls+bracket#PeierlsPoissonBracket) ([Khavkine 14](Peierls+bracket#Khavkine14)) the canonical Poisson bracket coincides, for the free scalar field theory, with the [[Peierls bracket]].

## Examples

* The [[theory (physics)|theory]] defined on a single scalar field $\phi$ over a [[Minkowski spacetime]] $X$ and with [[action functional]] given by 

  $$
    \phi 
    \mapsto \int_X (\vert\nabla \phi\vert^2 + k \phi^n) dvol
  $$

  is called **$\phi^n$ theory** ("phi-to-the-n theory"). These theories are are simple toy examples that play an important role in the investigation of general aspects of [[quantum field theory]], such as [[renormalization]]. Of course the potential term can be generalized to be a more general [[polynomial]] of $\phi$. This appears notably as a sector in models of [[cosmic inflation]], where $\phi$ is called the _[[inflaton field]]_.
