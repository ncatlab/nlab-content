## Idea

In [[physics]], a __scalar field__ is a [[field (physics)|field]] on [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] which is simply a [[function]] with values in the [[field of scalars]], typically the [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]].


## Examples

* The [[theory (physics)|theory]] defined on a single scalar field $\phi$ over a [[Minkowski spacetime]] $X$ and with [[action functional]] given by 

  $$
    \phi 
    \mapsto \int_X (\vert\nabla \phi\vert^2 + k \phi^n) dvol
  $$

  is called **$\phi^n$ theory** ("phi-to-the-n theory"). These theories are are simple toy examples that play an important role in the investigation of general aspects of [[quantum field theory]], such as [[renormalization]]. Of course the potential term can be generalized to be a more general [[polynomial]] of $\phi$. This appears notably as a sector in models of [[cosmic inflation]], where $\phi$ is called the _[[inflaton field]]_.

* [[Higgs field]]
