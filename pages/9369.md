## Idea

A _Stein manifold_  is a [[complex manifold]] which is a "holomorphically convex" and "holomorphically separable" subset of a $\mathbb{C}^n$.

I think all the following is true, but it is just from my bad memory: A Stein manifold is defined by three properties, maybe analytically convex and two other things. It turns out that Stein manifolds are exactly the closed analytic submanifolds of $\mathbf{C}^n$. Cartan's Theorem A and Theorem B are about coherent sheaves on Stein manifolds, and say that such a sheaf is generated by its global sections, and has vanishing higher cohomology.
