## Idea

A _Stein manifold_ is a [[complex manifold]] satisfying some niceness condition generalizing the concept of a [[domain of holomorphy]]. From the point of view of [[cohomology]] Stein manifolds are to [[complex manifolds]] as [[Cartesian spaces]] are to [[smooth manifolds]]: 

every [[complex manifold]] has a "good [[cover]]" by Stein manifolds and the positive-degree [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with values in any analytic [[coherent sheaf]] on any Stein manifold vanishes (this is _[[Cartan's theorem B]]_, see [below](#CartanTheoremB)). This implies for instance that with respect to [[covers]] of complex manifolds by Stein manifolds usual [[Cech cohomology]] techniques work for analytic coherent sheaves (such as the [[structure sheaf]] of [[holomorphic functions]]).

Accordingly, Stein spaces are close to being the [[affine varieties]] over the [[complex numbers]], but not quite, see [below](#RelationToAffineVarieties).

## Definition

### Stein manifold

The original definition ([Stein 51](#Stein51)) says that
a _Stein manifold_  $\Sigma$ is a [[complex manifold]] which is a "holomorphically convex" and "holomorphically separable" subset of a $\mathbb{C}^n$.

This is equivalent to ([[Reinhold Remmert]], Narasimhan, Bishop) saying that $\Sigma$ admits a [[proper morphism|proper]] [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]]  [[immersion]] $\Sigma \hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}^n$.

### Stein spaces

A [[complex analytic space]] is a _Stein space_ precisely if its [[reduction modality|reduction]] is a [[Stein manifold]].

## Examples

Every [[domain of holomorphy]] in some $\mathbb{C}^n$ is a Stein manifold.

Every closed [[submanifold|sub-]][[complex manifold]] of a Stein manifold is itself Stein.

Every non-[[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]] is a Stein manifold (by Behnke-Stein).




## Properties

### Basic properties

A Stein manifold is necessarily a non-[[compact topological space]].

### Good covers by Stein manifolds
 {#GoodCoversBySteinManifolds}

Every [[complex manifold]] admits a [[good cover]] by Stein manifolds, in the sense that all finite non-empty intersections of the cover are Stein manifolds (e.g. [Maddock, lemma 3.2.8](#Maddock)), _not_ in the sense that these intersections are contractible! Rather, all Dolbeault cohomology in positive degree vanishes.

### Cohomology
 {#Cohomology}

The following central property of Stein manifolds is due to [[Henri Cartan]]

+-- {: .num_theorem #CartanTheoremB}
###### Theorem
**[[Cartan's theorem B]]**

On a Stein manifold $\Sigma$  and for $A$ an analytic [[coherent sheaf]] on $\Sigma$ then all the [[positive number|positive]]-degree [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] groups of $\Sigma$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ vanish:

$$
  H^{\bullet \geq 1}(\Sigma, A) = 0
  \,.
$$

=--

This is recalled for instance as ([Forstnerič 11, theorem 2.4.1](#Forstneric11))

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Also all [[positive number|positive]]-degree [[Dolbeault cohomology]] groups vanish:

$$
  H^{\bullet, \bullet \geq 1}_{\bar \partial}(\Sigma) = 0
  \,.
$$

This is recalled for instance as  ([Forstnerič 11, theorem 2.4.6](#Forstneric11)).

### Relation to affine varieties
 {#RelationToAffineVarieties}

The [[analytification]] of any [[affine variety]] over the [[complex numbers]] is a Stein space, but the converse is not quite true. ([Zhang 06](#Zhang06)). There is also [some theorem by Neeman](http://mathoverflow.net/a/2087/381) to this effect.

See also at _[affine variety -- Cohomology](affine+variety#Cohomology)_.

### Oka-Grauert principle

The _[[Oka-Grauert principle]] states that for any [[Stein manifold]] $X$ the holomorphic and the topological classification of [[complex vector bundles]] on $X$ coincide. The original reference is ([Grauert 58](#Grauert)).
