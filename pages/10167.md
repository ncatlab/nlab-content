## Idea

By the general discussion at _[[equivariant K-theory]]_, given a suitable [[topological group]] $G$ with an [[action]] on a [[topological space]] $X$ there is a canonical map

$$
  K_G(X) \to K_G^{Bor}(X) \simeq K_G(X \times E G) \simeq K(X//G)
$$

from the [[equivariant K-theory]] of $X$ to the ordinary [[topological K-theory]] of the [[homotopy quotient]] ([[Borel construction]]).

While this map is never an [[isomorphism]] unless $G$ is the [[trivial group]], the _Atiyah-Segal completion theorem_ says that this map exhibits $K(X//G)$ as the [[formal completion]] of the ring $K_G(X)$ at the [[augmentation ideal]] of the [[representation ring]] of $G$ (hence, regarded as a [[ring of functions]], the restriction to an [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of the base point).

See also at _[formal completion -- Examples -- Atiyah-Segal theorem](completion+of+a+ring#AtiyahSegalTheorem)_.

The analog stable for [[stable cohomotopy]] is the _[[Segal-Carlsson completion theorem]]_:

## Consequences

In the case where $X=*$ (i.e. a point), we have that $K_G(*) \simeq R(G)$ and $K(*//G)=K(BG)$, thus we conclude that

$$
  K(BG) \simeq R(G)\hat{_I}
$$

where $I$ is the [[augmentation ideal]] of the [[representation ring]] of $G$.
