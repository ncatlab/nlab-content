## Idea

The _AdS-CFT correspondence_ (or _[Maldacena](Maldacena) duality_ ) is a class of cases for which there is strong evidence that it realizes the more general and more conjectural [[holographic principle|holographic duality]]:

the conjectural Ads/CFT correspondence asserts an identification of the [[state]]s of [[quantum gravity]] given by [[string theory]] on an [[asymptotically anti de Sitter spacetime|asymptotically]] [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] with [[correlator]]s of a [[CFT|superconformal]] [[Yang-Mills theory]] on the asymptotic boundary.

## Examples

The solutions to [[supergravity]] that preserve the maximum of 32 [[supersymmetries]] are (e.g. [HEGKS 08 (1.1)](BPS+state#HEGKS08))

* $AdS_5 \times S^5$ in [[type II supergravity]]

* $AdS_7 \times S^4$ in [[11-dimensional supergravity]]

* $AdS_4 \times S^7$ in [[11-dimensional supergravity]]

as well as their [[Minkowski spacetime]] and plane wave limits. These are the main [[KK-compactifications]] for the following examples-


### $AdS_5 / CFT_4$ -- Horizon limit of D3-branes
 {#AdS5CFT4}

[[type II string theory]] on 5d [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] (times a 5-sphere) is dual to [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] on the [[worldvolume]] of a [[D3-brane]] at the asymptotic boundary

([Maldacena 97, section 2](#Maldacena97))

([Aharony-Gubser-Maldacena-Ooguri-Oz 99, section 3 and 4](#AharonyGubserMaldacenaOoguriOz99))

### $AdS_7 / CFT_6$ -- Horizon limit of M5-branes
 {#AdS7CFT6}

We list some of the conjectured statements and their evidence concerning the case of $AdS_7/CFT_6$-duality.

The hypothesis ([Maldacena 97, section 3.1](#Maldacena97)) (see ([Aharony-Gubser-Maldacena-Ooguri-Oz 99, section 6.1.1](#AharonyGubserMaldacenaOoguriOz99)) for a review) 
is that 

* the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of $N$ coincident [[M5-branes]] 

is holographically related to 

* [[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|reduced on]] the 4-[[sphere]] $S^4$ with $N$ units of [[flux]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] to [[7d supergravity]] on an asymptotically [[anti de Sitter spacetime]].

In 

* {#WittenI} [[Edward Witten]], _Five-Brane Effective Action In M-Theory_ J. Geom. Phys.22:103-133,1997 ([arXiv:hep-th/9610234](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9610234))
 
effectively this relation was already used to computed the 5-brane [[partition function]] in the abelian case from the states of abelian [[7d Chern-Simons theory]]. (The quadratic refinement of the [[supergravity C-field]] necessary to make this come out right is what led to [[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology, and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 02]] and hence to the further mathematical development of [[differential cohomology]] and its application in physics.)

In ([Witten 98, section 4](#Witten98)) this construction is argued for from within the framework of AdS/CFT, explicitly identifying the [[7d Chern-Simons theory]] here with the compactification of the 11-dimensional Chern-Simons term of the [[supergravity C-field]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]], which locally is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S_{11d SUGRA, CS}(C_3)
    &=
    \int_{AdS_7} \int_{S^4} C_3 \wedge G_4 \wedge G_4
    \\
    & = N \, \int_{AdS_7} C_3 \wedge G_4
   \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

But in fact the [[quantum anomaly]] cancellation ([[Green-Schwarz mechanism|GS-type mechanism]]) for 11d sugra introduces a quantum correction to this Chern-Simons term ([DLM, equation (3.14)](\DLM)), making it locally become

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S(\omega,C_3)
    &=
    \int_{AdS_7} \int_{S^4} C_3 \wedge G_4 \wedge (G_4 + I_8(\omega))
    \\
    & = N \, \int_{AdS_7}
    \left(
       C_3 \wedge G_4
       +
       \frac{1}{48} CS_{p_2}(\omega) - 
        \frac{1}{12} CS_{\frac{1}{2}p_1}(\omega)
        \wedge tr(F_\omega \wedge \omega)
    \right)
   \end{aligned}
   \,,
$$

where now $\omega$ is the local 1-form representative of a [[spin connection]] and where $CS_{p_2}$ is a [[Chern-Simons form]] for the second [[Pontryagin class]] and $CS_{\frac{1}{2}p_1}$ for the first.

That therefore not an abelian, but this _nonabelian_ [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] should be dual to the nonabelian [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] was maybe first said explicitly in ([LuWang 2010](#LuWang)).

Its gauge field is hence locally and ignoring the flux quantization subtleties a pair consisting of the abelian 3-form field $C$ and a [[Spin group]] $Spin(6,1)$-valued [[connection on a bundle|connection]] (see _[[supergravity C-field]] for global descriptions of such pairs). Or maybe rather  $Spin(6,2)$ to account for the constraint that the configurations are to be asymptotic [[anti de Sitter spacetimes]] (in analogy to the well-understood situation in [[3d quantum gravity]], see there for more details).


{#CommentSezginSundell} Indeed, in ([SezginSundell 2002, section 7](#SezginSundell)) more detailed arguments are given that the 7-dimensional dual to the free 6d theory is a [[higher spin gauge theory]] for a higher spin [[gauge group]] extending the ([[superconformal group|super]]) [[conformal group]] $SO(6,2)$.

A [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] description of this nonabelian [[7d Chern-Simons theory]] as a [[local prequantum field theory]] (hence defined [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbatively]] on the global [[moduli stack]] of [[field (physics)|fields]] ([[twisted differential string structures]], in fact)) was discussed in ([FSS 12a](#FSS12a), [FSS 12b](#FSS12b)).

General discussion of [[boundary field theory|boundary]] [[local prequantum field theories]] relating higher Chern-Simons-type and higher WZW-type theories is in ([[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct 13, section 3.9.14]]). Specifically, a characterization along these lines of the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] of the [[M5-brane]] as a holographic [[infinity-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory - contents|higher WZW-type]] boundary theory of a 7d Chern-Simons theory is found in ([FSS 13](#FSS13)).

Analogous discussion of the 6d theory as a higher WZW analog of a7d Chern-Simons theory phrased in terms of [[extended quantum field theory]] is ([[4-3-2 8-7-6|Freed 12]]).

#### QCD models

While all of the above horizon limits product [[super Yang-Mills theory]], one can consider certain limits of these in which they look like plain [[QCD]], at least in certain sectors. This leads to a discussion of hologrpahic description of QCD properties that are actually experimentally observed.

## Formalizations

The full formalization of AdS/CFT is still very much out of reach. 

One proposal for a formalization of a toy version in the context of [[AQFT]] is [[Rehren duality]]. However, it does not seem that this actually formalizes AdS-CFT, but something else.
