## Idea

The _AdS-CFT correspondence_ (or _[Maldacena](Maldacena) duality_ ) is a class of cases for which there is strong evidence that it realizes the more general and more conjectural [[holographic principle|holographic duality]]:

the conjectural Ads/CFT correspondence asserts an identification of the [[state]]s of [[quantum gravity]] given by [[string theory]] on an asymptotically [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] with [[correlator]]s of a [[CFT|superconformal]] [[Yang-Mills theory]] on the asymptotic boundary.

## Examples

### $AdS_5 / CFT_4$

[[type II string theory]] on 5d [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] is dual to [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]].

### $AdS_7 / CFT_6$
 {#AdS7CFT6}

We list some of the conjectured statements and their evidence concerning the case of $AdS_7/CFT_6$-duality.

The hypothesis ([Maldacena 97, section 3.1](#Maldacena)) is that 

* the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of $N$ coincident [[M5-branes]] 

is holographically related to 

* [[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|reduced on]] the 4-[[sphere]] $S^4$ with $N$ units of [[flux]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] to [[7d supergravity]] on an asymptotically [[anti de Sitter spacetime]].

In ([Witten 98, section 4](#Witten98)) is is argued that the [[conformal blocks]] of the 6d theory are entirely given already by the [[state]]s of (just) the effective [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7-dimensional Chern-Simons term]] of the [[supergravity C-field]], which locally is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S_{11d SUGRA, CS}(C_3)
    &=
    \int_{AdS_7} \int_{S^4} C_3 \wedge G_4 \wedge G_4
    \\
    & = N \, \int_{AdS_7} C_3 \wedge G_4
   \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

But in fact the [[quantum anomaly]] cancellation ([[Green-Schwarz mechanism|GS-type mechanism]]) for 11d sugra introduces a quantum correction to this Chern-Simons term ([DLM, equation (3.14)](\DLM)), making it locally become

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S(\omega,C_3)
    &=
    \int_{AdS_7} \int_{S^4} C_3 \wedge G_4 \wedge (G_4 + I_8(\omega))
    \\
    & = N \, \int_{AdS_7}
    \left(
       C_3 \wedge G_4
       +
       \frac{1}{48} CS_{p_2}(\omega) - 
        \frac{1}{12} CS_{\frac{1}{2}p_1}(\omega)
        \wedge tr(F_\omega \wedge \omega)
    \right)
   \end{aligned}
   \,,
$$

where now $\omega$ is the local 1-form representative of a [[spin connection]] and where $CS_{p_2}$ is a [[Chern-Simons form]] for the second [[Pontryagin class]] and $CS_{\frac{1}{2}p_1}$ for the first.

That therefore not an abelian, but this _nonabelian_ [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] should be dual to the 6d theory was maybe first said explicitly in ([LuWang 2010](#LuWang)).

Its gauge field is hence locally a pair consisting of the abelian 3-form field $C$ and a [[Spin group]] $Spin(6,1)$-valued [[connection on a bundle|connection]] (see _[[supergravity C-field]] for global descriptions of such pairs). Or maybe rather  $Spin(6,2)$ to account for the constraint that the configurations are to be asymptotic [[anti de Sitter spacetime]]s (in analogy to the well-understood situation in [[3d quantum gravity]], see there for more details).

Indeed, in ([SezginSundell 2002](#SezginSundell)) more detailed arguments are given that the 7-dimensional dual to the 6d theory is a [[higher spin gauge theory]] for a higher spin [[gauge group]] extending $SO(6,2)$.



## Formalizations

The full formalization of AdS/CFT is still very much out of reach. 

One proposal for a formalization of a toy version in the context of [[AQFT]] is [[Rehren duality]]. However, it does not seem that this actually formalizes AdS-CFT, but something else.

it is argued that the [[conformal block]]s of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] are entirely controled just by the effective [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|7d Chern-Simons theory]] inside [[11-dimensional supergravity]], but only the abelian piece is discussed explicitly.

The fact that this Chern-Simons term is in fact a _nonabelian_ [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in $d = 7$, due the [[quantum anomaly]] cancellation, is clear from the original source, equation (3.14) of

There is in fact one more quantization condition to be taken into account. For more in that see [[schreiber:7d Chern-Simons theory and the 5-brane|here]].
Up to the further twists discussed there, this means that the gauge group of the effective 7d theory is some contraction of the [[Spin group]] $Spin(10,1)$. The asymptotic AdS condition suggests maybe that it should be $Spin(6,2)$.

In fact, in

arguments are given that the 7d theory is a [[higher spin gauge theory]] extension of $SO(6,2)$.
