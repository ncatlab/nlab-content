## Idea

While the [[rationalization]] of [[complex topological K-theory]] has lost most interesting information (being just a [[direct sum]] of [[ordinary cohomology]] [[rational cohomology]] in every even degree) the [[rationalization]] of its enhancement to [[equivariant cohomology]] -- [[equivariant K-theory]] -- is still a comparatively rich object, controlled by the rational [[representation theory]] of the given equivariance group.

Rational equivariant K-theory appears in a variety of different but equivalent concrete incarnations, such as [[Bredon cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the [[representation ring]]/[[class functions]] or as [[Chen-Ruan cohomology]] (here shown over the [[complex numbers]], see [Lück-Oliver 01](#LueckOliver01) for discussion over the [[rational numbers]]):


[[!include incarnations of rational equivariant topological K-theory -- table]]

As any [[Chern-Dold character]], the [[equivariant Chern character]] on [[equivariant K-theory]] takes values in its [[rationalization]]. Hence, together with the above variety of presentations of rational equivariant K-theory, there is a corresponding variety of realizations of the [[equivariant Chern character]].
