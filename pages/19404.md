## Idea

A _spherical space form_ is a [[quotient space]] $S^n/G$ of a round [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[n-sphere]] by a [[discrete group]] $G$ of [[isometries]] which [[action|acts]] [[free action|freely]] and [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]]. 

The spherical space forms are one of three classical examples of _[[Clifford-Klein space forms]]_.

Their classification was raised as an open problem by [Killing 1891](#Killing1891) and a complete solution was finally compiled by ([Wolf 74](#Wolf74)) (reviewed for instance in [Gadhia 07, section 2.2](#Gadhia07)). A re-proof of the classification is claimed in ([Allock 15](#Allock15)). 

For more on this see at _[[group actions on n-spheres]]_.

## Examples

* The [[near horizon geometry]] of smooth (i.e. non-[[orbifold]]) $\geq \tfrac{1}{2}$ [[BPS state|BPS]] [[black brane|black]] [[M2-brane]]-solution of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] is the [[Cartesian product]] $AdS_4 \times (S^7/G)$ of 4-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] with a 7-[[dimension|dimensional]] spherical space form $S^7/G$, for $G$ a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] ([MFFGME 09](#MFFGME09)).
