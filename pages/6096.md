## Idea

A _homological_ [[TQFT]] is a representation of the [[cobordism]] category that depends only on the [[homology]] of the [[hom-space]]s.

In $d = 2$ this is also called a _homological_ [[conformal field theory]]. The passage to homology forgets the conformal structure.
The refinement of this concept from [[homology group]]s to [[chain complex]]es is called [[TCFT]].


## Definition

Write $Bord$ for any given [[cobordism category]], regarded as a [[Top]]-[[enriched category]]. A **homological TQFT** is a [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric monoidal]] [[Ab]]-[[enriched functor]]

$$
  Z : H_\bullet(Bord) \to Ab
  \,.
$$

## Applications

* The [[string topology]] operations of a manifold are part of an HTQFT. See there for details.
