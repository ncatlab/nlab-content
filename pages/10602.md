A [[binary algebraic structure]] $(A,\cdot)$ satisfies the medial law or __mediality__ if for all $a,b,c,d\in A$
$$
(a\cdot b)\cdot(c\cdot d) = (a\cdot c)\cdot (b\cdot d)
$$
Medial unital magmas are, by [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]], automatically Abelian [[monoid]]s. There is a relation between medial quasigroups and
Abelian groups, given by [[Bruck-Toyoda theorem]]. 

Every transpose (conjugate, in the sense of associated ternary relation) conditions to mediality is also the mediality condition.
An old term for mediality is also entropy condition/property ("entropic quasigroups").
