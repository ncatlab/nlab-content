## Idea

The term _brave new algebra_ has been coined to refer to the [[higher algebra]] of [[E-infinity rings]] ("brave new rings"), amplifying the step from more traditional [[algebra]].

Specifically, the term is typically used for the particular presentation of [[E-infinity rings]] by way of [[highly structured ring spectra]] such as ([[commutative monoids|commutative]]) [[monoids]] with respect to a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] (such as available on [[orthogonal spectra]] ([[orthogonal ring spectra]]), [[symmetric spectra]] ([[symmetric ring spectra]]) and [[S-modules]]).

According to [Greenlees 06, p. 1](#Greenlees06):

> The phrase 'brave new rings' was coined by [[Friedhelm Waldhausen|F.Waldhausen]], presumably to capture both an optimism about the possibilities of generalizing rings to ring spectra, and a proper awareness of the risk that the new step in abstraction would take the subject dangerously far from its justification in examples.

In consequence people also speak for instance of _brave new Hopf algebroids_ when referring to the [[Hopf algebroids]] of (dual) $E$-[[Steenrod algebras]] for some [[ring spectrum]] $E$ as appearing in the [[Adams spectral sequence]]. See at _[Steenrod algebra -- Hopf algebroid structure](#Steenrod+algebra)_.
