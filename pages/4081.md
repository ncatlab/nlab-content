A rational map $f: X -\to Y$ of varieties is __birational__ if there is a rational map $g: Y -\to X$ such that both compositions $g\circ f$ and $f\circ g$ are defined as rational maps and equal the identity. Two varieties are birational or birationally isomorphic if there is a birational map between them. See [[birational geometry]].
