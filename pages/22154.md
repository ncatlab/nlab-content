## Idea

In [[electromagnetism]] the _Hall effect_ ([Hall 1879](#Hall1879)) is essentially the manifestation of the [[Lorentz force]] in [[conductors]]: 

It is the phenomenon that an [[electric current]] flowing [[perpendicular]] to a [[magnetic field]] induces an [[electric field]] perpendicular to both of these, sourced from the separation of positive and magnetic charge carriers in the current, which are driven apart by the [[Lorentz force]].
