## Idea

In the ordinary language of [[mathematics]], a _theorem_ is an statement which is of interest in its own right and which we know to be true even though it\'s not immediately clear why.  This contrasts with a _lemma_ (which is of interest primarily because of its implications for other statements), a _conjecture_ (which is not known to be true), an _axiom_ (which is obviously true), a _proposition_ (which follows immediately from definitions and axioms), or a _corollary_ (which follows immediately from other known facts).

In [[logic]], the only part of this to be formalised is how we know things to be true (formalised by the concept of [[proof]]), so to a logician, *any* proved statement is a theorem.  The term '[[proposition]]', to a logician, means *any* statement and does *not* imply the existence of a proof.  The term '[[axiom]]' is used in a way that somewhat matches its ordinary usage, but an axiom is now a special case of a theorem.  The other terms appear not to be used in logic.


## Definition

In a given [[logic]], in a given [[context]], we have various [[propositions]] and various [[proofs]] of propositions.  In that context, a __theorem__ is a proposition with a proof.

A theorem should be contrasted with a [[tautology]]: a proposition that is [[truth|true]] in all [[models]].  If every tautology (in a given context) is a theorem, then we say that the context is __complete__ (relative to a given class of models); if every theorem is a tautology, then the context is __sound__.  (A logic is complete or sound if all of its contexts are.)
