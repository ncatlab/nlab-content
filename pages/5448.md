## Definition

Fix some [[scheme]] $S$.

###### Definition

The **fpqc-site** (over $S$) is the [[site]] 

* whose underlying category is the category $Aff/S$ of [[affine scheme]]s [[over category|over]] $S$;

* whose [[coverage]] has as [[covering]] families $\{f : U_i \to X\}$
  those families of morphisms that are  such that 

  * each $f_i$ is a [[flat morphism]];

  * for every affine open $W \hookrightarrow X$ there exists $n \geq  0$, a [[function]] $a : \{1, \cdots, n\} \to I$ and affine opens
    $V_j \hookrightarrow T_{a(j)}$ with

    $$
      \cup_{j = 1}^{n} f_{a(j)}(V_j) = W
      \,.
    $$

This appears as ([de Jong, def. 27.8.1](#deJong)).

###### Remark

The last condition does imply that $\cup_i f_i(U_i) = X$.

###### Remark


The abbreviation "fpqc" is for _fidèlement plat quasi-compacte_ : faithfully flat and quasi-compact.
