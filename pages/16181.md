A __semi-atom__ is a generalization of the notion of [[atom]] in a [[bottom]] bounded [[partial order]].

An object $a$ is a semi-atom when the [[interval]] $[\bot, a ]$ is a [[partial order chain|chain]], i.e. any two objects $x$ and $y$ in that interval are [[comparable]]  ($x \le y$ or $y \leq x$).
 
All atoms are semi-atoms and usually the bottom is not considered one.

If $a$ and $b$ are semi-atoms then their [[meet]] exists and we have $a \wedge b \in \{\bot, a, b\}$

## Examples

The [[divisor lattice]] for some number $n$ contains prime numbers as atoms and may contain powers of primes as semi-atoms that are not atoms.
