Let $G$ be a [[group]] and $M$ an [[abelian group]] with a $G$-action, i.e. a $\mathbb{Z}G$-[[module]] where $\mathbb{Z}G$ is the [[group ring]] of $G$.  Let $T$ be a set of [[prime numbers]]; we say that $M$ is a **$T$-local module** if for all $x\in G$, the element $(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{n-1})\in \mathbb{Z}G$ acts invertibly on $M$ for all $n$ not divisible by any primes in $T$.  If $T=\{p\}$ we speak of a $p$-local module.

Note that if $G$ acts trivially on $M$, this is equivalent to asking that $M$ is a $T$-local abelian group.  In general, it is strictly stronger.

The notion can also be characterized as a module over the [[localization of a ring|localization of the (noncommutative!) ring]] $\mathbb{Z}G$ at the set of elements $1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{n-1}$.
