## Idea

According to the [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]], for a [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[theory]] with a [[countable set|countable]] alphabet if there is an [[infinite set|infinite]] [[model theory|model]], then there is a countable model. Let us consider the language of some form of [[set theory]] and a model satisfying the [[axiom of infinity]]. Then Cantor's [[diagonal argument]] can be carried internally within the model and provides internally uncountable "sets" in that countable model.

The resolution of this apparent [[paradox]] is that, while this conclusion is true internally, it is not true externally: namely any two infinite sets are countable externally in that model, hence there is a $1$--$1$ function between any two of them including for a model of some uncountable set $X$ and of its power set $P(X)$. However, the that function (or its graph) is not in the model! One can enlarge the model by adding that function (and more). But this extended model will necessary have $P(X)$ uncountable externally and there is no $1$--$1$ function from $X$ to $P(X)$ externally any more.
