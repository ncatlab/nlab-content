

In [[gauge theory]] a _planar limit_ is a limit in which [[scattering amplitudes]] are dominated by [[Feynman diagrams]] which can be given the structure of planar [[graphs]].
In particular, this phenomenon happens in [[large N limit]].

See at [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] for discussion of the main examples.
