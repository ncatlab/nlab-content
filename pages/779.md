Charles Ehresmann was a pioneer in investigating [[groupoid]]s and then [[category|categories]] for their applications in [[geometry|geometric]] problems. It is notable that he was a student of Elie Cartan, famous for his work in Analysis. As a consequence, Ehresmann was fascinated by local-to-global problems, which are among the key problems in mathematics and science. This is one reason for his approach to category theory being different from that in the USA, where category theory was founded.

He had a succession of influential students, and among the concepts which he initiated are: fibre [[bundle]]s, [[foliation]]s, [[germ]]es, [[gerbe]]s, [[double category|double categories]], [[internal category|topological and differentiable groupoids]], [[holonomy]], [[structured category|structured categories]], ...

The journal he founded and edited, [[Cahiers de Topologie et Géométrie Différentielle Catégoriques]], has been continued by his widow, [[Andree Ehresmann]].
