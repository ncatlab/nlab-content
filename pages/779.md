It is notable that he was a student of Elie Cartan, famous for his work in Analysis. As a consequence, Ehresmann was fascinated by local-to-global problems, which are among the key problems in mathematics and science. This is one reason for his approach to category theory being different from that in the USA, where it was founded. 

He had a succession of influential students, and among the concepts which he initiated are: fibre bundles, foliations, germes, gerbes, double categories, topological and differentiable groupoids, holonomy, structured categories, .....
