## Idea

Every [[geometric morphism]] factors as surjective morphism followed by an inclusion. The **(dense-closed)-factorization** can be viewed as a refinement of this factorization for [[geometric embeddings]] where the surjectivity of the first morphisms is weakened to [[dominant geometric morphism|dominance]] or 'density' and the inclusion is strengthened to a [[closed subtopos|closed inclusion]] in return.

So from a topological perspective, what one does, is by taking the closure of the image in which the image is merely dense, one approximates the image inclusion by a closed-subspace inclusion.

## Statement

A [[geometric embedding]] of [[elementary toposes]]

$$
  Sh_j(\mathcal{E}) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}
$$


factors as

$$
  Sh_j(\mathcal{E}) 
    \hookrightarrow
  Sh_{c(ext(j))}(\mathcal{E})
    \hookrightarrow
  \mathcal{E}
$$

where $ext(j)$ (the "exterior" of $j$) denotes the $j$-closure of $\emptyset \hookrightarrow \ast$ and 

$$
  \bar j \coloneqq c(ext(j))
$$ 

the [[closed subtopos|closed topology]] that corresponds to the [[subterminal object]] $ext(j)$.

Here the first inclusion exhibits a [[dense subtopos]] and the second a [[closed subtopos]].

## Remark

$Sh_{c(ext(j))}(\mathcal{E})$ can be viewed as the 'best approximation' of $Sh_j(\mathcal{E})$ by a closed subtopos and therefore might be called the _closure_ $Cl(Sh_j(\mathcal{E}))$ of $Sh_j(\mathcal{E})$.[^sga4] 

[^sga4]: ([SGA4](#SGA4), p.461) uses the term '_l'adhérence_' for it.

Its complement, the [[open subtopos]] $Ext(Sh_j(\mathcal{E}))$ corresponding to the [[subterminal object]] $ext(j)$ deserves in turn to be called the _exterior_ of $Sh_j(\mathcal{E})$.
