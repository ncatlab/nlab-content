A _black hole_ is any solution of Einstein equations for metrics (or a refinement, generalization etc.) possesing a __horizon__ hypersurface (or several of them) which has a number of special characteristics; for example the light can not escape from the space confined by the horizon hypersurface due to gravitational effects. 

Black holes are considered theoretically for gravitational theories in various number of dimension. For dimension form 5 up the nontrivial topologies, e.g. black rings are possible. In usual Minkowski 3+1-dimensinal space, the first known black hole solution is the [[Schwarzschild black hole]] solution; such a black hole posses a single horizon hypersurface and seems to be stable under various perturbations. Another solution with finite angular momentum is called the Kerr metric, and there is a simple generalization having also the electric charge, the Newman solution or the Kerr-Newman black hole. This solution differs pretty much from the Schwarzschild solution and its structure is unstable under various physical mechanisms and perturbations; it posesses two horizons, inner and outer. 

Some candidate [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] objects which seem to point to black hole have been observed.
