## Idea

A _black hole_ is a [[spacetime]] that solves [[Einstein equations]] of [[general relativity]] characterized by the fact that it posseses an __[[event horizon]]__ hypersurface (or several of them) which has a number of special characteristics; for example the light can not escape from the space confined by the horizon hypersurface due to [[gravity|gravitational]] effects. Much of the theoretical considerations are about the entropy of black holes (cf. [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]) and the information paradox.

Black holes are considered theoretically for [[gravity|gravitational theories]] in various number $d$ of dimension. For $d \geq 5$ a black hole [[spacetime]] may have nontrivial [[topology]], e.g. _[[black rings]]_ are possible. 

## Examples

* In usual asymptotically 3+1-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]], the first black hole solution that was found is the [[Schwarzschild black hole]] solution; such a black hole posses a single horizon hypersurface and seems to be stable under various perturbations. 

* Another solution with finite angular momentum is called the [[Kerr spacetime]], and there is a simple generalization having also the electric charge, the Newman solution or the Kerr-Newman black hole. This solution differs pretty much from the Schwarzschild solution and its structure is unstable under various physical mechanisms and perturbations; it possesses two horizons, inner and outer. 


## Properties

### Topology


Hawking's _Theorem of Black Hole topology_ asserts that the in case of $d = 4$ asymptotically flat stationary black holes satisfying the suitable [[dominant energy condition]], the cross sections of the [[event horizon]] are spherical.

[Galloway and Schoen](#GallowaySchoen) extended this theorem to higher dimensions; they showed that the cross sections of event horizon (stationary case) and the outer (apparent) horizon (general case) are of Yamabe type.

### Entropy

* [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]

* [[generalized second law of thermodynamics]]

## Empirical observation

* [[observing black holes]].
