__Category of cycles__ is a possibly better (but nonstandard) name for the [[Connes' cyclic category]] $\Lambda$ (or sometimes denoted $\mathcal{C}$) which is confusingly,
an example of a cocyclic object in $\mathrm{Cat}$.

If $A$ is an abelian category then the category of $A$-presheaves on $\Lambda$ is usually called (Connes') category of cyclic modules in $A$.
