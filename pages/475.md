#Idea#

A **tricategory** is a particular [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] notion of _weak_ [[3-category]].  The idea is that a tricategory is a category _weakly_ [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Bicat]]: the [[hom-object|hom-objects]] of a tricategory are [[bicategories]], and the associativity and unity laws of [[enriched category|enriched categories]] hold only up to coherent equivalence.
