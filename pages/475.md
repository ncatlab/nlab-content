## Idea

A **tricategory** is a particular [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] notion of _weak_ [[3-category]]. 
The idea is that a tricategory is a category _weakly_ [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Bicat]]: the [[hom-object|hom-objects]] of a tricategory are [[bicategories]], and the associativity and unity laws of [[enriched category|enriched categories]] hold only up to coherent equivalence.

## Coherence theorems
{#Coherence}

One way to state the coherence theorem for tricategories is that every tricategory is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to a [[Gray-category]], which is a sort of semi-strict 3-category (everything is strict except for the [[interchange law]]).

## Examples {#Examples}

For $R$ a commutative [[ring]], there is a [[symmetric monoidal bicategory]] $Alg(R)$ whose 

* [[object]]s are $R$-[[algebra]]s;

* [[morphism]]s are algebra [[bimodule]]s;

* [[2-morphisms|k-morphism]] are bimodule homomorphisms.

The monoidal product is given by [[tensor product]] over $R$.

By [[delooping]] this once, this gives an example of a [[tricategory]] with a single object.

The tricategory statement follows from Theorem 24 in either the journal version, or the arXiv:0711.1761v2 version of:

* [[Richard Garner]], [[Nick Gurski]]: The low-dimensional structures formed by tricategories. Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 146 (2009),pp. 551--589, ([arXiv:0711.1761](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1761))

This, and that the monoidal bicategory is even symmetric monoidal is given by the main theorem in

* [[Mike Shulman]], _Constructing symmetric monoidal bicategories_ ([arXiv:1004.0993](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0993))
