## Idea

$\zeta$-functions are [[functions]] on parts of the [[complex plane]], which look like [[generating functions]] for the counting of points in [[spaces]] in [[algebraic geometry]]. The archetypical and historically first example is the _[[Riemann zeta function]]_, which is 

$$
   \zeta \colon s \mapsto \underset{n = 1}{\sum}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}
  \,.
$$

Under the [[function field analogy]] one may understand this function in terms of the counting of points in $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$. This induces a plethora of generalizations: the _[[Dedekind zeta function]]_ generalizes this from [[integers]]/[[rational numbers]]  to [[number fields]]/their [[rings of integers]], the [[Goss zeta function]] to [[function fields]], the [[Weil zeta function]] (which is the topic of the famous [[Weil conjectures]]) to more general [[varieties]] over [[finite fields]], and the [[Selberg zeta function]] to [[complex curves]]([[Riemann surfaces]]). How all this hangs together is surveyed below in _[function field analogy](#FunctionFieldAnalogy)_.


This way many fields of [[mathematics]] have their own versions of _zeta functions_: [[arithmetic geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[graphs]], [[operator algebra]].  There are several articles trying to attach zeta functions attached to [[triangulated categories]] (and [[stable model categories]]...) and study them. Zeta functions express some [[motive|motivic]] information, hence the categorical framework must be natural as it is for [[motives]].

## Properties

### Function field analogy
 {#FunctionFieldAnalogy}

One way to understand the plethora of different zeta functions is to see them as the incarnation of the same general concept in different flavors of [[geometry]]. This is expressed at least in parts by the
