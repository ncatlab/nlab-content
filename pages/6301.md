A basic characteristic of [[physics]] in the context of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] is that causal influences on a [[Lorentzian manifold]] [[spacetime]] propagate in [[timelike]] or [[lightlike]] directions but not [[spacelike]].

The fact that any two spacelike-separated regions of spacetime thus behave like [independent subsystems](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+mechanics#Subsystems) is called **causal locality** or **Einstein causality**.

(One sometimes sees a further criterion to causality, that the causal influences in timelike and lightlike directions only propagate into the [[future]], but this is not so simply dealt with; it probably only makes sense as a statement about coarse-grained [[entropy]] in [[statistical physics]].)

For a formalization of this idea see for instance

* [[local net of observables]].
