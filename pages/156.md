## Definitions

A [[category]] is __skeletal__ if objects that are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] are necessarily [[equality|equal]].  (So this is a notion irredeemably violating the [[principle of equivalence]] of [[category theory]].)

Traditionally, a __skeleton__ of a category $C$ is defined to be a skeletal [[subcategory]] of $C$ whose [[inclusion functor]] exhibits it as 
[[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $C$.

However, in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]], it is more appropriate to define a __skeleton__ of $C$ to be *any* skeletal category which is [[equivalence of categories|weakly equivalent]] to $C$.

## Properties

### Existence of skeletons

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then every category $C$ has a skeleton (in the strongest sense).
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Simply choose one object in each isomorphism class and one isomorphism to that object from each other object in that class.

In more detail, generate the full subcategory $sk(C)$ containing just the chosen objects. Denote by $in\colon sk(C)\to C$ the inclusion. We exhibit a weak inverse of $in$ as a functor
$-':x\mapsto x'$ constructed as follows. For every object $x$ one has chosen already the unique object $x'$ in $sk(X)$ isomorphic to $x$, but one also needs to make a choice of isomorphism $i_x\colon x\to x'$ for every $x$. This enables to conjugate between $C(x,y)$ and $C(x',y')$ by 

$$
(x\stackrel{f}\to y)\mapsto (x'\stackrel{i_x^{-1}}\to x\stackrel{f}\to y\stackrel{i_y}\to y').
$$ 

The rule for *morphisms* $-': f\mapsto f' := i_y\circ f\circ i_{x}^{-1}$ is clearly functorial. Let us show that $-'$ is a weak inverse of $in$. In one direction, given $y\in sk(C)$ we compute $(in_{y})' = y$ (strict equality); in another direction, given $x\in C$, notice that $i^{-1}_{in_{x'}}:in_{x'}\cong x$  for $x\in C$ is an isomorphism. It suffices to show that these isomorphisms for all $x\in C$ together form a *natural* isomorphism $i^{-1}_{in}:in_{-'}\to id_C$; the naturality diagram is commutative precisely because of the conjugation formula for the functor $-'$ for morphisms. This completes the proof that $-'$ is indeed a weak inverse of $in$.

In fact, the statement that every (possibly [[small category|small]]) category has a skeleton is _equivalent_ to the axiom of choice if "subcategory" and "equivalence" have their naive ('strong') meanings.  For given a [[surjection]] $p:A\to B$ in $Set$, make $A$ into a category with a unique isomorphism $a\cong a'$ iff $p(a)=p(a')$; then a skeleton of $A$ supplies a splitting of $p$.

Even with the more general notion of weak or ana-[[equivalence of categories]], some amount of choice is required to show that every category has a skeleton.  It would be interesting to know the precise strength of the statement "every category is weakly equivalent to a skeletal one."  One thing we can say without any choice is:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Any [[thin category]] (i.e. any [[preordered set]]) has a skeleton (in the sense of weak equivalence).
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
In this case, we can take the objects of the skeleton of $C$ to be the isomorphism classes of $C$.  If $C$ is thin, then we can define a partial ordering on its set of isomorphism classes, making them into a skeleton of $C$.
=--

Notice that the [[axiom of choice]] fails in general when one considers [[internal category|internal categories]].  Hence not every [[internal category]] has a skeleton. A necessary condition for an internal category $X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0$ to have a skeleton is the existence quotient $X_0/X_1$ - the object of orbits under the action of the core of $X$. If the quotient map $X_0 \to X_0/X_1$ has a section, then one could consider $X$ to have a skeleton, but this condition isn't sufficient for the induced inclusion functor to be a weak equivalence of internal categories when this makes sense (i.e. if the category is internal to a site).

[[David Roberts]]: The claim above about the necessity of the existence of the quotient needs to be checked.

### Equivalents of choice

Define a *coskeleton* of a category $C$ to be a skeletal category $S$ with a surjective equivalence $C\to S$.  In [[Categories, Allegories]] it is shown that the following are equivalent.

1. Any two ana-equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.

   I removed 'non-ana', since I don\'t think that 'strongly equivalent' would ever be used in an 'ana-' sense.  ---Toby

   Addendum:  Actually, I don\'t know why I asked whether you meant weakly or strongly here, since obviously one can prove that two ana-equivalent categories are weakly equivalent!  It seems that the discussion above used the terms 'equivalence' and 'ana-equivalence' where [[equivalence of categories]] uses 'strong equivalence' and 'weak equivalence' or 'ana-equivalence'; so I just changed it.  And then I added another entry, which maybe you should remove if Freyd & Scedrov don\'t actually address it.  On the other hand, if they really talk about weak equivalence instead of ana-equivalence (although if they define it in elementary terms, it\'s hard to tell the difference), maybe there\'s no need to say 'ana-' at all on this page.
   =--
1. Any two weakly equivalent categories are strongly equivalent.
1. Every small category has a skeleton.
1. Every small category has a coskeleton.
1. Any two skeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.
1. Any two coskeletons of a given small category are isomorphic.

For convenience we add:

1. Given an inhabited family $\{S_i\}_I$ of equinumerous sets there exists $0 \in I$  and a family of isomorphisms of the permutation groups $\{Aut(S_0) \to Aut(S_i)\}_I$.
1. Given a family $\{S_i\}_I$ of inhabited equinumerous sets, there exists a family $(x_i)_I$ such that $x_i \in S_i$ for all $i \in I$.

### Uniqueness of constructions

It is well-known that objects defined by [[universal property|universal properties]] in a category, such as [[limits]] and [[colimits]], are not unique on the nose, but only unique up to unique canonical isomorphism.  It can be tempting to suppose that in a *skeletal* category, where any two isomorphic objects are equal, such objects will in fact be unique on the nose.  However, under the most appropriate definition of "unique," this is *not* true (in general), because of the presence of automorphisms.

More explicitly, consider the notion [[cartesian product]] in a category.  Although we colloquially speak of "a product" of objects $A$ and $B$ as being the *object* $A\times B$, strictly speaking a product consists of the object $A\times B$ *together with* the projections $A\times B\to A$ and $A\times B\to B$ which exhibit its universal property.  Thus, even if the category in question is skeletal, so that there can be only one object $A\times B$ that is a product of $A$ and $B$, in general this object can still "be the product of $A$ and $B$" in many different ways.

For example, given any projections $A\times B\to A$ and $A\times B\to B$ that exhibit $A\times B$ as a product of $A$ and $B$, we can compose them both with any automorphism of $A\times B$ to get a new, different, pair of projections that also exhibit $A\times B$ as a product of $A$ and $B$.  In fact, the universal property of a product implies that any two pairs of projections are related by an automorphism of $A\times B$, so this example is generic.  Thus, even in a skeletal category, we cannot speak of "the" product of $A$ and $B$, except in the same [[generalized the|generalized sense]] that makes sense in any category.  A formal way to say this is that the "category of products of $A$ and $B$," while still *equivalent* to the [[trivial category]], as it is in any category with products, will not be *isomorphic* to the trivial category even when the ambient category is skeletal.

(It is true in a few cases, though, that skeletality implies uniqueness on the nose.  For instance, a [[terminal object]] can have no nonidentity automorphisms, so in a skeletal category, a terminal object (if one exists) really is unique on the nose.)
