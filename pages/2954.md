Freed's work revolves around the mathematical ingredients and foundations of modern [[quantum field theory]] and of [[string theory]], notably in its more subtle aspects related to [[quantum anomaly cancellation]] (which he was maybe the first to write a clean mathematical account of). In the article _[[Higher Algebraic Structures and Quantization]]_ (1992) he envisioned much of the use of [[higher category theory]] and [[higher algebra]] in [[quantum field theory]] and specifically in the problem of [[quantization]], which has -- and still is -- becoming more widely recognized only much later. He recognized and emphasized the role of [[differential cohomology]] in physics for the description of [[higher gauge field|higher]] [[gauge fields]] and their anomaly cancellation. Much of his work focuses on the nature of the [[Freed-Witten anomaly]] in the quantization of the [[superstring]] and the development of the relevant tools in [[supergeometry]], and notably in [[K-theory]] and [[differential K-theory]]. More recently Freed aims to mathematically capture the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]].
