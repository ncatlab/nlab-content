## Idea

Let $C$ be [[symmetric monoidal category]] and $C$ the category of [[commutative monoids]] in $C$.
When $C$ is further a [[model category]], there are certain conditions under which there is an induced [[model structure]] on $CMon(C)$, where the [[weak equivalences]] and [[fibrations]] are defined as in $C$.

## Distinction between E-infinity monoids

Recall that $CMon(C)$ can be described as the category of [[algebras over an operad]] over the [[operad]] [[Comm]].
If the operad [[Comm]] were [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]], then for the existence of the induced model structure on $CMon(C)$ it would be sufficient to require the [[monoid axiom in a monoidal model category|monoid axiom]], and to use the [[model structure on algebras over an operad]] as discussed there.
However [[Comm]] is in general not cofibrant, and this is the distinction between [[Comm]] and the [[E-infinity operad]]: the latter is a [[cofibrant replacement]] of the former.
This is why the [[model structure]] on [[commutative monoids]] may not always exist even when the model structure on [[E-infinity monoids in a symmetric monoidal model category]] does.

For example, take $C$ to be the category of [[chain complexes]] over a [[field]] of [[positive characteristic]].
Then the category of [[commutative monoids]] in $C$ is the category of [[commutative dg-algebras]].
This does not have an induced [[model structure]], as explained in [MO/23885/2503](http://mathoverflow.net/a/23885/2503).

See [Rectification](#Rectification) for some results on when the [[model structures]] on [[E-infinity monoids]] and [[commutative monoids]] are [[Quillen equivalent]], though.

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[symmetric monoidal model category]] and let $CMon(C)$ denote the category of [[commutative monoids]] in the underlying category of $C$.
Define a [[weak equivalence]] (resp. [[fibration]]) of [[commutative monoids]] to be a [[weak equivalence]] (resp. [[fibration]]) of the underlying objects of $C$.
Below we will give sufficient conditions for this to define a [[model structure]] on $CMon(C)$.

## Existence

###### Theorem
Suppose that
  * $C$ is [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]],
  * $C$ is _freely powered_, i.e.
    * $C$ satisfies the [[monoid axiom in a monoidal model category]],
    * $C$ is [[left proper model category|left proper]] and ...
    * every cofibration in $C$ is a _power cofibration_, i.e. ...

Then the category $CMon(C)$ is a [[combinatorial model category]] with [[weak equivalences]] and [[fibrations]] as defined above.

See ([Lurie](#LurieHA), Proposition 4.5.4.6).

Next we state a more general version of this result, for which we will require some set-theoretic assumptions.
Suppose that $C$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] by a set of [[cofibrations]] $I$ and a set of [[trivial cofibrations]] $J$.
Let $I \otimes C$-cell denote the closure of $I \otimes C = \{ i \otimes \id_X : i \in I, X \in Ob(C) \}$ under [[cobase change]] and [[transfinite composition]], and similarly for $J \otimes C$-cell.

###### Theorem
Suppose that
  * $C$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] by a set of cofibrations $I$ and a set of fibrations $J$,
  * the [[domains]] of the morphisms in $I$ (resp. $J$) are [[small objects]] relative to $(I\otimes C)$-cell (resp. $(J\otimes C)$-cell),
  * $C$ satisfies the [[monoid axiom in a monoidal model category]]
  * $C$ satisfies the _commutative monoid axiom_, i.e. ...

Then the category $CMon(C)$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with [[weak equivalences]] and [[fibrations]] as defined above.

If $C$ is further [[simplicial model category|simplicial]] (resp. [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]], [[tractable model category|tractable]]), then so is $CMon(C)$.

## Rectification

Rectification of $E_\infty$-monoids is the question of whether the [[weak equivalence]] between the [[operads]] [[Comm]] and the [[E-infinity operad]] induces a [[Quillen equivalence]] on the [[model category of algebras over an operad|model categories of algebras]].
Since the [[model category of algebras over an operad]] over the [[E-infinity operad]] is a presentation of the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[commutative monoids in a symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]], rectification for $C$ is equivalent to saying that the [[(infinity,1)-category]] presented by the model structure on [[commutative monoids]] is equivalent to the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[commutative monoids in a symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] presented by $C$.

The following cases are particularly interesting.

* Rectification holds in the [[model category]] of [[symmetric spectra]].
* It does not hold in the [[model category]] of [[simplicial sets]] or in the [[model category]] of [[simplicial abelian groups]].

See ([Lurie](#LurieHA), Theorem 4.5.4.7) for sufficient conditions for rectification to hold.
See also ([White 14](#White14), Paragraph 4.2) for more discussion.
