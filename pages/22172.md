> We show that the double copy of gauge theory amplitudes to N=0 supergravity amplitudes extends from tree level to loop level. We first explain that color-kinematics duality is a condition for the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin operator and the action of a field theory with cubic interaction terms to double copy to a consistent gauge theory. We then apply this argument to Yang-Mills theory, where color-kinematics duality is known to be satisfied on shell at the tree level. Finally, we show that the latter restriction can only lead to terms that can be absorbed in a sequence of field redefinitions, rendering the double copied action equivalent to N=0 supergravity.
