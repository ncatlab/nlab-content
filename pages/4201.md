## Idea ##
The concept of a causal complement is suitable to establish a [[causal disjointness relation]] on index sets where the indices are subsets of a given set. This generalizes the concept of causal complement of subsets of the [[Minkowski spacetime]], see for example [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]].

## Definition ##
Let $X$ be an arbitrary set and $M \subset X$. An assignment 
$$
M \mapsto M^{\perp} \subset X
$$
is called a **causal complement** if the following conditions hold:

(i) $M \subseteq M^{\perp\perp}$

(ii) $(\bigcup_j M_j)^{\perp} = \bigcap_j (M_j)^{\perp}$

(iii) $M \bigcap M^{\perp} = \emptyset$

A set $M$ is **causally closed** iff $M = M^{\perp\perp}$.

The set $M^{\perp\perp}$ is the **causal closure** of $M$.

## Properties ##
Causal complements are always causally closed. The intersection of two causally closed sets is again a causally closed set. The causal complement of a set may be empty.

A [[causal disjointness relation]] on an index set of subsets of a given set $X$ can be defined via
$$
M_1 \perp M_2 \; \text{iff} \; M_1 \subseteq (M_2)^{\perp}
$$
if all sets $M$ have a causal complement and if

(iv) there is a sequence $(Y_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of mutually different subsets with $Y_n^{\perp} \neq \emptyset$ and $\bigcup Y_n = X$.

The latter condition is needed to get an _unbounded_ [[poset]], the unboundedness is part of the definition of a  [[causal index set]].
