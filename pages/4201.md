## Idea ##

The concept of a _causal complement_ is suitable to establish a [[causal disjointness relation]] on index sets where the indices are subsets of a given set. This generalizes the concept of causal complement of subsets of the [[Minkowski spacetime]], see for example [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]].

## Definition 


The concept of causal complement, as the name indicates, a concept related to [[causality]] on [[spacetimes]], hence a concept associated with [[Lorentzian manifolds]]:

* _[On Lorentzian manifolds](#OnLorentzianManifolds)_.

One may abstract away some of the key properties of causal complements on Lorentzian manifolds to obtain a more general concept:

* _[Abstract definition](#AbstractDefinition)_

### On Lorentzian manifolds
 {#OnLorentzianManifolds}

Let $X$ be [[Lorentzian manifold]] (a [[spacetime]]), hence a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] with one [[time-like]] dimension in each tangent space. 

Then for $S \subset X$ any [[subset]], its _[[causal cone]]_ $J(S)$ is the subset of all points in $X$ which may be joined to a point of $S$ by a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[curve]] $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ which is everywere [[timelike]] or [[lightlike]].

###### Definition
**(causal complement of subset of Lorentzian manifold)**

For $S \subset X$ a [[subset]] of a [[Lorentzian manifold]], its _causal complement_ $S^\perp$ is the [[complement]] of the [[causal cone]]:

$$
  S^\perp \;\coloneqq\; S \setminus J(S)
  \,.
$$

The causal complement $S^{\perp \perp}$ of the causal complement $S^\perp$ is called the _[[causal closure]]_. If 

$$
  S = S^{\perp \perp}
$$

then the subset $S$ is called a _[[causally closed subset]]_.

### Abstract definition
 {#AbstractDefinition}


Let $X$ be an arbitrary set and $M \subset X$. An assignment 

$$
  M \mapsto M^{\perp} \subset X
$$

is called a **causal complement** if the following conditions hold:

(i) $M \subseteq M^{\perp\perp}$

(ii) $(\bigcup_j M_j)^{\perp} = \bigcap_j (M_j)^{\perp}$

(iii) $M \bigcap M^{\perp} = \emptyset$

A set $M$ is **[[causally closed subset|causally closed]]** iff $M = M^{\perp\perp}$.

The set $M^{\perp\perp}$ is the **[[causal closure]]** of $M$.

## Properties ##
Causal complements are always causally closed. The intersection of two causally closed sets is again a causally closed set. The causal complement of a set may be empty.

A [[causal disjointness relation]] on an index set of subsets of a given set $X$ can be defined via
$$
M_1 \perp M_2 \; \text{iff} \; M_1 \subseteq (M_2)^{\perp}
$$
if all sets $M$ have a causal complement and if

(iv) there is a sequence $(Y_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of mutually different subsets with $Y_n^{\perp} \neq \emptyset$ and $\bigcup Y_n = X$.

The latter condition is needed to get a _$\sigma$-bounded_ [[poset]]; the $\sigma$-boundedness is part of the definition of a  [[causal index set]].
