|1945| |[[Jean Leray]]| |Starts [[sheaf theory]]: A [[sheaf]] on a [[topological space]] $X$ is a [[functor]] reminding of a function defined locally on $X$ and taking values in [[set]]s, abelian [[group]]s, commutative [[ring]]s, [[module]]s or generally in any [[category]] $C$. In fact [[Alexander Grothendieck]] later made a [[dictionary between sheaves and functions]]. Another interpretation of sheaves is as continuously [[varying set]]s (a generalization of [[abstract set]]s). Its purpose is to provide a unified approach to connect local and global properties of [[topological space]]s and to classify the obstructions for passing from local objects to global objects on a topological space by pasting together the local pieces.

|1958| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |Starts new foundation of [[algebraic geometry]] by generalizing varieties and other spaces in algebraic geometry to [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] which have the structure of a category with open subsets as objects and restrictions as morphisms.

|1963| |[[William Lawvere]]| |Founds [[categorical logic]], discovers [[internal logic|internal logics]] of categories and recognizes its importance and introduces [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]]. Essentially categorical logic is a lift of different logics to being internal logics of categories. Each kind of category with extra structure corresponds to a system of logic with its own inference rules. A Lawvere theory is an [[algebraic theory]] as a category with finite products and possessing a "generic algebra" (a generic group). The structures described by a Lawvere theory are models of the Lawvere theory|

|1963| |[[Charles Ehresmann]]| |[[internal category|Internal category theory]]: Internalization of categories in a category V with pullbacks is replacing the category Set (same for classes instead of sets) by V in the definition of a category. Internalization is a way to rise the [[categorical dimension]]|
|1963| |[[Charles Ehresmann]]| |[[multiple category|Multiple categories]] and [[multiple functor|multiple functors]]|
|1963| |[[Saunders Mac Lane]]| |[[Monoidal categories]] also called tensor categories: Strict 2-categories with one object made by a [[relabelling trick]] to categories with a [[tensor product]] of objects that is secretly the composition of morphisms in the 2-category. There are several object in a monoidal category since the relabelling trick makes 2-morphisms of the 2-category to morphisms, morphisms of the 2-category to objects and forgets about the single object. In general a higher relabelling trick works for [[n-category|n-categories]] with one object to make general monoidal categories. The most common examples include: [[ribbon category|ribbon categories]], [[braided tensor category|braided tensor categories]], [[spherical category|spherical categories]], [[compact closed category|compact closed categories]], [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric tensor categories]], [[modular category|modular categories]], [[autonomous category|autonomous categories]], [[category with duality|categories with duality]]|

|1964| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]] | |Introduced in a letter to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] conjectural [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motives (algebraic geometry)]] to express the idea that there is a single universal cohomology theory underlying the various cohomology theories for algebraic varieties. According to Grothendieck's memoirs this idea has been born in 1958. According to Grothendiecks philosophy there should be a universal cohomology functor attaching a [[Motive (algebraic geometry)#pure motives|pure motive]] h(X) to each smooth projective variety X. When X is not smooth or projective h(X) must be replaced by a more general [[Motive (algebraic geometry)#mixed motives|mixed motiv]]e which has a weight filtration whose quotients are pure motivess. The [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|category of motives]] (the categorical framework for the universal cohomology theory) may be used as an abstract substitute for singular cohomology (and rational cohomology) to compare, relate and unite "motivated" properties and parallel phenomena of the various cohomology theories and to detect topological structure of algebraic varieties. The categories of pure motives and of mixed motives are abelian tensor categories and the category of pure motives is also a [[Tannakian category]]. Categories of motives are made by replacing the category of varieties by a category with the same objects but whose morphisms are [[correspondence]]s, modulo a suitable equivalence relation. Different [[equivalence]]s give different theories. [[Rational equivalence]] gives the category of [[Chow motive]]s with [[Chow group]]s as morphisms which are in some sense universal. Every geometric cohomology theory is a functor on the category of motives. Each induced functor ρ:motives modulo numerical equivalence→graded '''Q'''-vector spaces is called a [[realization]] of the category of motives, the inverse functors are called [[improvement]]s. Mixed motives explain phenomena in as diverse areas as: Hodge theory, algebraic K-theory, polylogarithms, regulator maps, automorphic forms, L-functions, ℓ-adic representations, trigonometric sums, homotopy of algebraic varieties, algebraic cycles, moduli spaces and thus has the potential of enriching each area and of unifying them all|

|1973| |Chris Reedy| |[[Reedy category|Reedy categories]]: Categories of "shapes" that can be used to do homotopy theory. A Reedy category is a category R equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape R. The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on R is the existence of a model structure on the [[functor category]] M<sup>R</sup> whenever M is a [[model category]]. Another advantage of the Reedy structure is that its cofibrations, fibrations and factorizations are explicit. In a Reedy category there is a notion of an injective and a surjective morphism such that any morphism can be factored uniquely as a surjection followed by an injection. Examples are the ordinal α considered as a [[poset]] and hence a category. The opposite R° of a Reedy category R is a Reedy category. The [[simplex category]] Δ and more generally for any [[simplicial set]] X its category of simplices Δ/X is a Reedy category. The model structure on M<sup>Δ</sup> for a model category M is described in an unpublished manuscript by Chris Reedy|

Lurie's theory of higher toposes can be interpreted as giving a good theory of sheaves taking values in ∞-categories.

In a higher topos not only mathematics can be done but also "n-geometry", which is [[higher homotopy theory]]. The [[topos hypothesis]] is that the (n+1)-category nCat is a Grothendieck (n+1)-topos.

#Proposed Guidelines#
Every entry should include:
* A year
* A list of 'contributors', typically authors of some paper or book.  This should include links to --- possibly not yet created --- pages about these contributors.
* A very brief sketch of the new concept or result that was introduced by these authors.  This should include links to pages containing definitions of the technical terms that are used.  If such pages don't exist yet, we can include a link and create the page later.

For historians and people writing bibliographies, it will be very helpful if there exists a _reference_ to any paper or book in which a concept or result was introduced.  However, we can put this information in the page for that concept or result.

#Discussion#

###Concerning the Desire for References###

Rafael: John, if you need references a priority is needed for which references to include first.

[[John Baez|John]]: I would really like to know who first defined (strict) 2-categories, and in precisely what book or paper!  I have a fairly large number of references already, [here](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/history.pdf) and in some [other expository papers](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf).  If I had more time I would transfer a lot of these references to the $n$Lab --- though I see on the $n$Forum that Andrew Stacey wants to improve our facilities for dealing with references, and maybe I should wait for that.   

In general, people will consult this timeline if they want to know when something was done, but such people often also want to know _where_ it was done.  And, no scholar worth his salt would accept a date without any way to check whether it's correct.

Rafael:
The first reference i found was your "An introduction to n-categories" that states that strict 2-categories where first defined by C. Ehresmann in 1965 and by 1962 (page 12). I must have reasoned that since you mention two years and also speak about strict n-categories that were defined in 1965 you must mean that strict 2-categories were defined in 1962, and adopted it in the timeline.

A further search found "A 2-categories companion" - Stephen Lack, where he states that C. Ehresmann defined strict 2-categories in reference 13 which is the 1965 "Categories et structures". I have changed the year in the timeline.

Then i think you are missing one of the big points with the timeline: to find things (mostly explanations) that are hard to find elsewhere. This might not seem hard to experts in category theory but for the rest "nonexperts" it is. I know how much time i have spend on it. For instance first i could not find any definition of a $A_\infty$-category for a long time. Then i found 9 definitions (excluding nLab)! Only 2 of them completely agreed! I had to actually make a table with all the differences to compare them. I think i got it right.

###Concerning the Desire for Definitions###

If you look back in the history of this page, you'll see that Rafael had written some rather different guidelines, including:

* Don't leave anything undefined.

This led to a discussion:

[[Toby Bartels]]:
On the contrary, I think that we should keep entries in the table short and save explanations and definitions for the links.  The key is too choose intelligent links, especially for concepts that don\'t yet have entries.  Compare the [[HowTo|naming conventions]] and the [current page names](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/list) (ignoring those with `-- history` in the name, which tend to be ill formed). 

Rafael: It depends how short. I had nontechnical definitions in mind but sometime i only have technical definitions. It is no point in only giving a link in each entry under event. On the other hand the longest entries are too long. It is no harm in repeating intuitive definitions and the point of the subjects from the links in the timeline. Just as it is no harm in moving/copying information from the timeline to the links as long as there is something to read in the timeline.

Rafael:
As for the guideline "Don't leave anything undefined", it was a vague statement of me. What i ment was don't leave any symbols used undefined. If i ment definitions of the concepts, this would be the rule i had most easy to let go of.

[[John Baez|John]]: The main use of this page is to say when people did things --- not to explain things in detail.   The whole $n$Lab is designed to explain things.  Trying to put all those explanations in this page would make it enormous and defeat its purpose.  So, in this page we should simply write a sentence or two for each development that's listed, and include _links_ to pages that explain things in detail.  

As David noted, there were originally few breaks in the timeline where concepts are defined, like "simplicial set".  The choice of which concepts get defined seems quite arbitrary, and only a few of the hundreds of important concepts mentioned here are defined.  So, I'm going to delete all these breaks and use _links_ to pages where concepts are defined. But some of these breaks have interesting information, which we should save.  I'm attaching it below.  

Def: A category $C$ such that
* for all $X,Y$ in $Ob(C)$ the [[Hom-set]]s $Hom_C(X,Y)$ are finite dimensional [[chain complex]]es of $\mathbf{Z}$-graded modules
* for all objects $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ in $Ob(C)$ there is a family of linear composition maps (the higher compositions)
$m_n: Hom_C(X_0,X_1) \otimes Hom_C(X_1,X_2) \otimes \cdots \otimes Hom_C(X_{n-1},X_n) \to Hom_C(X_0,X_n)$ of degree $n-2$ (homological grading convention is used) for $n \geq 1$
* $m_1$ is the differential on the chain complex $Hom_C(X,Y)$
* $m_n$ satisfy the quadratic $A_\infty$-associativity equation for all $n \geq 0$.

$m_1$ and $m_2$ will be [[chain map]]s but the compositions $m_i$ of higher order are not chain maps, nevertheless they are [[Massey product]]s. In particular it is a [[linear category]].
Examples are the [[Fukaya category]] $Fuk(X)$ and [[loop space]] $\Omega X$ where $X$ is a topological space and $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebras]] as $A_\infty$-categories with one object.
When there are no higher maps (trivial homotopies) $C$ is a [[dg-category]]. Every $A_\infty$-category is quasiisomorphic in a functorial way to a dg-category. A quasiisomorphism is a chain map that is an isomorphism in homology.

The framework of dg-categories and dg-functors is too narrow for many problems, and it is preferable to consider the wider class of $A_\infty$-categories and $A_\infty$-functors. Many features of $A_\infty$-categories and $A_\infty$-functors come from the fact that they form a symmetric closed [[multicategory]], which is revealed in the language of [[comonad|comonads]]. From a higher dimensional perspective $A_\infty$-categories are weak $\omega$-categories with all morphisms invertible. $A_\infty$-categories can also be viewed as [[noncommutative formal dg-manifold]]s with a closed marked subscheme of objects

Rafael: It's not the best solution but it works. I hope no information is lost (can't check now, nLab returns blank pages). The pattern is that i avoided defining what was defined in wikipedia unless i could contribute to the definition, and i was on my way to define or say something about the rest as i learn it. That depend upon what i could find on internet.

_Toby_:  Please note that those 'breaks' contained material that originally belonged to the entry immediately above the break.  This tells us what page this material should go on!

###Concerning the Desire for Pages Devoted to Mathematicians###

Rafael: I see that Toby has linked David Hilbert. Do we want to link all the linked persons in the timeline such as David Hilbert, Helmut Hofer and Zoltán Szabó?

_Toby_:  I don\'t know, but lately I\'ve thought that we link names too little.  I don\'t think that we should write serious biographies here, but it\'s nice to see what some person has worked on.

Rafael: I did find a way of automating the process. Here is an automated transfer. OK, something weird is happening to the table, as if it is too long.

[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]:  You\'re putting stuff in the table that Instiki\'s primitive table handling can\'t do.  I\'m fixing it a bit, but it\'s a kludge just to make things readable.  All in all, this would probably work better as a list; you can do all of this stuff in a list here, and it\'s easy to enough to separate out year and person with dashes.  I\'ll write the first three entries in that style so you can look at it.  (PS: You\'re Fotino?)

Rafael: I am very much for the table as everything blends otherwise. Yes i am Fotino.

The problem seem to be that Instiki interprets Def: and Definition: wrongly. Is there a way to temporary turn it off such as nowiki?

[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]:  No, it\'s not the definitions; it\'s the line breaks.  (Also vertical bars, I did these in math mode with `\vert`.)  There\'s probably a way to do that with the table markup; I\'ll experiment.  If nothing else, we can also use HTML table markup; use `<table markdown="1">…</table>` to get iTeX etc inside the tables.

I don\'t understand what you mean by 'everything blends'.  But I\'m not going to worry about that now.

Rafael: I simply mean that the text in the different cells melts together when the boundaries are invisible. An esthetic thing, but i like beautiful math.

_Toby_:  ???  I don\'t think that text melts together when we use a list.  And using a list makes it easy to include line breaks and so forth as you\'ve wanted.  What\'s more, a long list is easier than a long table for browsers to render.  So I still think that we should use a list!

###Concerning the Desire for 'Milestones'###

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I am very fond of the aim of this entry. I suggest, though (and might start implementing that when I find time), that we try to split, for the reader's convenience, a list of true generally accepted _milestone_ constributions that indicate the big stepts forward, from a a list that rather aims to give a somewhat complete list of all contributions of some relevance.

Rafael: Why not splitting?  The table will grow larger and a split will be necessary soon anyway. I just hope everyone agrees what the milestones are.

: [[John Baez|John]] We won't agree on the milestones, but we can have fun arguing about it.  I think this page here should include _lots_ of developments, with just a little text about each one, so people can find out when things happened.  Another entry, called something like "Milestones in Category Theory and Related Mathematics", could be more selective.  We should not remove information from this big list, but we can copy "milestones" to a shorter list.

: When writing papers it's often nice to refer to the article or book where a concept was first developed.  So, I want to have this information in the $n$Lab eventually.  In particular, if we claim that multiple categories were invented in 1963 by Ehresmann, we should have a reference somewhere to back up this claim.  But maybe that reference should appear in the (not-yet-existent) page on multiple categories.  That will prevent this page from becoming unnecessarily long.

[[David Corfield|David]]: I can see the milestone list being contentious. Anyway far more important to improve this timeline first. We could do with some experts looking it over. I'm sure most would include the effective topos concept much sooner than the quantum topos. I've transported out some of the material for a couple of lengthy entries, e.g., AST. It looks better to have entries of comparable length and with no breaks in the table, e.g., to define cosmoses.

[[John Baez|John]]: I've deleted the entry on 'quantum topos', since in fact most experts are very doubtful that a correct definition has been found for this notion, and they're even uncertain such a notion deserves to exist. Let's stick to concepts that are fairly widely considered to be fruitful.

:Rafael:
I don't mind deleting it. But i am also curious what is wrong with the definition

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: that sounds good. Maybe I was thinking that "timeline of category theory" sounds like it shouldn't contain just every little bit. So maybe if and when we split, is there any majority for keeping this title here for the _short_ list and another title for the long list, maybe _literature list of category theory_ or the like?

[[John Baez|John]]:  Right now I don't feel this timeline contains too much minor stuff.  It mostly just contains stuff that's very important to the history of categories and related math.   I might take out a few things, but mostly I'd feel the need to add things to get a reasonably full timeline.

I might shorten some of the entries though: the longer ones seem to be on topics that Rafael knows more about, so their length doesn't seem proportional to their importance.  I also don't think there need to be 5 entries devoted to my first paper with Jim Dolan!

Someday someone (maybe Andrew Stacey) will create an easy way for us to dump bibliographical information into the $n$Lab, and then maybe we can grow an enormous 'literature list' without doing too much work.  

Rafael: I actually had the idea to collect John's first paper in a separate entry. If i don't find a way to do line breaks a separate page is needed for it. The same goes for pursuing stacks! I am very interesting to hear what you have in mind to add! I would edit more (especially clean up links and style in the timeline) but nLab is too slow for me to edit efficiently.

_Toby_:  See [[Bibliography]] for the beginnings of a literature list.
