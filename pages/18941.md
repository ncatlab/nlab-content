## Idea

A 2-[[cell]] in a [[cell complex]], such as a [[polyhedron]] (or in a [[globular set]] or [[simplicial set]], or [[cubical set]] etc.) is often called a _face_.

More generally one calls cells in the [[boundary]] of a [[cell complex]] faces, even if they are higher dimensions (for instance in the definition of [[simplices]] and [[simplicial sets]]).
