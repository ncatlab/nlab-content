## Idea

For $G$ a suitable [[Lie group]], the _Verlinde ring_ is the collection of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[positive energy representations]] of the corresponding [[loop group]], equipped with the "fusion" [[tensor product]].

The Verlinde ring is also understood as being the ring of [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[twisted K-theory]] classes on $G$ ([FHT](#FHT)) and, essentially equivalently, of [[Chan-Paton gauge fields]] over [[D-branes]] in the [[WZW model]] (see there for further references).

> We study conformal field theories with a finite number of primary fields with respect to some chiral algebra. It is shown that the fusion rules are completely determined by the behavior of the characters under the modular group. We illustrate with some examples that conversely the modular properties of the characters can be derived from the fusion rules. We propose how these results can be used to find restrictions on the values of the central charge and conformal dimensions.
