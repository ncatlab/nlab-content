## Idea

For $G$ a suitable [[Lie group]], the _Verlinde ring_ is the collection of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[positive energy representations]] of the corresponding [[loop group]], equipped with the "fusion" [[tensor product]].

The Verlinde ring is also understood as being the ring of [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[twisted K-theory]] classes on $G$ ([FHT](#FHT)) and, essentially equivalently, of [[Chan-Paton gauge fields]] over [[D-branes]] in the [[WZW model]] (see there for further references).
