## Idea

The notion of _$A_\infty$-field_ is to the notion of [[A-∞ algebra]] as that of _[[field]]_ is to [[associative algebra]]/[[ring]].

## Definition

###### Remark

An [[A-∞ ring]] or in fact just an [[H-space]] $A$ is a **field** if $\pi_\bullet A$ is a [[graded field]].

For instance ([Lurie, lecture 24, def. 3](#LurieLecture)).


## Examples

The [[Morava K-theory]] [[A-∞ rings]] $K(n)$ are essentially the only $A_\infty$-fields. See at _[Morava K-theory  -- As infinity-Fields](Morava+K-theory#AsInfinityFields)_.
