## Idea

A _Killing vector_ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]] is equivalently 

* a _covariantly constant vector field_ : a [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(T C)$ that is annihilated by (the symmetrization of) the [[covariant derivative]] of the corresponding [[Levi-Civita connection]];

* an [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] [[isometry]].

Similarly a _Killing spinor_ is a covariantly constant [[spinor]].


## Definition

For $(X,g)$ a [[Riemannian manifold]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]) a [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(T X)$ is called a **Killing vector field** if it generates [[isometries]] of the [[metric]] $g$. More precisely, if, equivalently

* the [[Lie derivative]] of $g$ along $v$ vanishes: $\mathcal{L}_v g = 0$;

* the [[flow]] $\exp(v)  : X \times \mathbb{R} \to X$ is a flow by [[isometries]].

## Properties

The [[flows]] of Killing vectors are [[isometries]] of the Riemannian manifold onto itself.
