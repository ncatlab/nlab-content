**Diagrammatic order** is a way of writing the composite of [[morphisms]] in a [[category]] which aligns more closely with the way in which [[commutative diagram]]s are often drawn. Given arrows 

$$A \overset{f} {\to} B\overset{g}{\to}C$$ 

in the "classical" notation their [[composite]] would be written as 

$$A \overset{g f}{\to} C$$ 

or as 

$$A\overset{g\circ f}{\to} C$$ 
(both are very common). Note that the order has been reversed from the original diagram, although it aligns more closely with the traditional way of writing function application $(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$.  

By contrast, in diagrammatic order the composite of $f$ and $g$ above would be written as 

$$A \overset{f g}{\to} C$$ 

or as 

$$A \overset{f; g}{\to} C$$ 
with the order preserved from the original diagram.  The $f g$ notation occurs in some important older papers.

Is $f; g$ really more common than $f g$, as Charles Wells wrote here a moment ago?  I\'ve seen $f g$ more often (even for this order) and $f; g$ mostly in CS-oriented literature, but my experience is probably not as broad.  ---Toby

The change you made is probably good.  Much of my work in category theory was done in connection with computer science, so my perception may be skewed.  --Charles

OK, thanks!  ---Toby

Although diagrammatic order has advantages and partisans, especially among category theorists and computer scientists, the "classical" order of composition is firmly entrenched in much of mathematics.  Many people who agree that diagrammatic order is "better" on its own merits nevertheless believe that trying to change the established "classical" order of composition creates more confusion than it removes.

In some older category theory papers, arrows were written pointing from right to left, so that the composition of arrows could be written in the "classical" style, while still preserving the diagrammatic intuition. Hom-sets were accordingly written $C(b,a)$, where $a$ is the [[source]], and $b$ is the [[target]].
