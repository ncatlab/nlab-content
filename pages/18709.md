## Idea

A _sphere fiber bundle_ is a [[fiber bundle]] whose [[fibers]] are [[spheres]] $S^n$ of some [[dimension]] $n$.

Often, but not always, this is considered in [[homotopy theory]] or even in [[stable homotopy theory]], hence for [[fibers]] which have the ([[stable homotopy type|stable]]) [[homotopy type]] of a sphere, in which case one speaks of _[[spherical fibrations]]_. See there for more.

## Examples

A key example of sphere fiber bundles are the _unit sphere bundles_ inside of [[real vector bundles]] that are equipped with [[orthogonal structure]]: the bundles whose [[fibers]] are the [[unit spheres]] in the corresponding fiber of the given [[real vector bundle]].

These appear in the discussion of [[Thom spaces]] and hence of [[Thom spectra]], as well as in the discussion of [[wave front sets]].
