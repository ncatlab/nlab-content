## Idea

_Floer homology_ is a common name for several similar frameworks of infinite-dimensional analogues of [[Morse homology]], related to certain [[elliptic operator]]s. Some of these are related to [[symplectic geometry]] or [[contact geometry]] and another group is related to aspects of the geometry of 3-[[manifolds]]. One of these uses the [[Chern-Simons theory]] [[action functional]] as a [[Morse function]] on the space of [[connection on a bundle|connection]]s on $G$-[[principal bundle]]s over the given 3-manifold.

The most important flavours are the **Floer-Oh homology for [[action functional]]s** which is important in the study of [[symplectic manifold]]s, its version for Lagrangean intersection theory and the instanton Floer homology studied by Andreas Floer and important in the study of 3-manifolds and the mathematics of [[gauge theories]]. 

Floer homology for the [[action functional]] is a more systematic approach to the phenomena which were discovered several years before Floer in a historical article of [[Mikhail Gromov]] on J-holomorphic curves.
