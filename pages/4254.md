## Idea

_Floer homology_ is a common name for several similar frameworks of infinite-dimensional analogues of [[Morse homology]], related to certain [[Fredholm operator]]s which arise as [[elliptic operator]]s on certain manifolds. Some of these are related to [[symplectic topology]]/[[symplectic geometry|geometry]] or [[contact geometry]] and another group is related to aspects of the geometry of 3-[[manifolds]]. One of these uses the [[Chern-Simons theory]] [[action functional]] as a [[Morse function]] on the space of [[connection on a bundle|connection]]s on $G$-[[principal bundle]]s over the given 3-manifold.

The most important flavours are the **Floer-Oh homology for [[action functional]]s** which is important in the study of [[symplectic manifold]]s, its version for Lagrangean intersection theory and the instanton Floer homology studied by [[Andreas Floer]] and important in the study of 3-manifolds and the mathematics of [[gauge theories]]. 

Floer homology for the [[action functional]] is a more systematic approach to the phenomena which were discovered several years before Floer in a historical article of [[Mikhail Gromov]] on [[J-holomorphic curves]]. 

## Examples and Variants

### Instanton Floer homology

For $\Sigma$ a 3-[[dimension]]al [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] and $G$ a [[simply connected]] [[compact space|compact]] [[Lie group]] let $[\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$ be the [[space]] of $G$-[[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $\Sigma$, which is equivalently the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued forms]] on $\Sigma$ in this case.

The _instanton Floer homology_ groups of $\Sigma$ are something like the "mid-dimensional" [[singular homology]] groups of the [[configuration space]] $[\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$.

More precisely, there is canonically the [[Chern-Simons action functional]]

$$
  S_{CS} : [\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \to U(1)
$$

on this space of connections, and one can form the corresponding [[Morse homology]].

The [[critical locus]] of $S_{CS}$ is the space of flat $G$-connections (vanishing [[curvature]]), whereas the [[flow line]]s of $S_{CS}$ correspond to the [[Yang-Mills instanton]]s on $\Sigma \times [0,1]$.
