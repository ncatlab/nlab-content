## Idea

In [[logic]], the _contraction rule_ states that any valid [[deduction]] that uses a [[premise]] more than once remains valid using that premise only once.  Along with the [[weakening rule]] and the [[exchange rule]], it is one of the most commonly adopted [[structural rules]].


## Statements

Exactly how this looks depends on the [[logic]] used.
