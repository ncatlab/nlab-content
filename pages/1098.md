## Definition ## 

Write $(\infty,0)Cat$ for [[generalized the|the]] category [[∞Grpd]] of $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]].

Let $S$ be a [[simplicial set]] (which in particular may be a [[quasi-category]]). 

An **$(\infty,1)$-presheaf** on $S$ is an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  F : S^{op} \to (\infty,0)Cat
  \,.
$$

The [[(∞,1)-category]] of $(\infty,1)$-presheaves is the corresponding [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]]

$$
 PSh(S) := Fun(S^{op}, (\infty,0)Cat)
 \,.
$$

## Remarks ##

* $(\infty,1)$-presheaves are the basic building block for the definition of [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves]].
