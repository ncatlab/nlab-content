__George Lusztig__ is a mathematician at MIT, born in Romania. He has many deep contributions to Lie theory and representation theory, especially using and developing the methods of [[geometric representation theory]]. He discovered the canonical bases of quantum and Lie groups (in a sense dual to the crystal basis of [[Masaki Kashiwara]]).
