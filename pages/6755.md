## Idea

__Ergodic theory__ studies [[dynamical system]]s in spaces with an invariant [[measure]]. In particular, the long term limit of the average of the position of a particle is studied. In [[statistical physics]], the derivation of various [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] principles depends much on what is called the __ergodic hypothesis__ ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis)) saying that in long the term in a system with a large number of particles the probability of passing on the constant [[energy]] surface near some particular [[state]] is independent of the state on that surface and its probability does not depend on the initial conditions (other than energy). 

Ergodic reasoning is important also in construction of counterexamples in geometry and geometric group theory as well as in the construction and study of various measures, representations, random walks and so on related to algebraic objects and objects of harmonic analysis.
