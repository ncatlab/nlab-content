__Ergodic theory__ studies [[dynamical system]]s in spaces with an invariant measure. In particular, the long term limit of the average of the position of a particle is studied. In [[statistical physics]], the derivation of various thermodynamic principles depends much on the so-called ergodic hypothesis saying that in long term in the system with large system of particles passing near some state on the surface of given energy is equally probable and this does not depend on the initial conditions (other than energy). 

Ergodic reasoning is important also in construction of counterexamples in geometry and geometric group theory as well as in the construction and study of various measures, representations, random walks and so on related to algebraic objects and objects of harmonic analysis.
