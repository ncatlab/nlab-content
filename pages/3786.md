This is a book entry on

*  [[James Glimm]], [[Arthur Jaffe]], 

   _Quantum physics: a functional integral point of view_, 

   535 pages, Springer

on the rigorous [[path integral]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] ([[constructive quantum field theory]]). 

In order to construct a fully rigorous definition of a [[quantum field theory]], the authors use the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms to define a notion of a quantum field that is equivalent to the [[Wightman axioms]], see [[Osterwalder-Schrader theorem]]. 

Note that the ultimate goal of the program, namely the fully rigorous construction of the [[standard model of particle physics]], has not been achived (yet) and has become one of the famous millenium problems of the Clay institute.

There are two editions, the first one from 1981, the second one from 1987.
