## Idea ##

A notion of real numbers that is [[sequentially modulated Cauchy complete]], because the [[modulated Cauchy real numbers]] are not sequentially modulated Cauchy complete in [[constructive mathematics]]

## Definition ##

### As a sequentially modulated Cauchy complete Archimedean field ###

Let $F$ be an [[Archimedean field]]. $F$ is *[[sequentially modulated Cauchy complete]]* if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $F$ with a [[modulus of convergence]] [[converges]]. The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the [[initial object]] in the [[category]] of sequentially modulated Cauchy complete Archimedean fields. 

### As a Cauchy structure ###

The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the initial object in the category of [[Cauchy structures]] and [[Cauchy structure homomorphisms]]. 

## Properties 

The [[analytic functions]], such as the [[exponential function]], the [[sine function]], and the [[cosine function]] are well defined in the HoTT book real numbers, since all modulated Cauchy sequences converge in the HoTT book real numbers.
