## Idea ##

A notion of real numbers that is sequentially [[Cauchy complete]], because the [[Cauchy real numbers]] are not sequentially Cauchy complete in [[constructive mathematics]]

## Definition ##

### As a sequentially Cauchy complete Archimedean field ###

Let $F$ be an [[Archimedean field]]. $F$ is *sequentially Cauchy complete* if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $F$ [[converges]]. The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the [[initial object]] in the [[category]] of sequentially Cauchy complete Archimedean fields. 

### As a Cauchy structure ###

The set of __HoTT book real numbers__ $\mathbb{R}_H$ is the initial object in the category of [[Cauchy structures]] and [[Cauchy structure homomorphisms]].
