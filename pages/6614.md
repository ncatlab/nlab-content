## Idea

The notion of _$n$-plectic form_ is a generalization of the notion of [[symplectic form]] to [[differential forms]] of more than two arguments. This is considered in [[higher symplectic geometry]], specifically: in [[multisymplectic geometry]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, a [[differential form]] $\omega$ on $X$ is **$n$-plectic**
if 

1. it is an $n$-forms, $\omega \in \Omega^n(X)$;

1. it is closed: $d_{dR} \omega = 0$;

1. it is non-degenerate in that the [[contraction]] map

   $$
     \iota_{(-)}\omega : \Gamma(T X) \to \Omega^{n-1}(X)
   $$

   has trivial [[kernel]].

###### Remark

This definition has an evident generalization to the case where also $X$ is allowed to be a "higher" generalization of a smooth manifold, namely a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] or [[L-∞ algebroid]]. See [[higher symplectic geometry]] for more on this case.
