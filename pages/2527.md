## Warning

To the extent that the contents of this page are precise at all, they are speculative.  As far as I know, nobody has formulated, much less proved, the logical consistency and independence results that would justify its formal claims.

If you are content with [[set theory|set-theoretic]] foundations for category theory, you may ignore the adjective 'strict' in 'strict category'; in 'strict functor' it basically means 'non-[[anafunctor|ana]]' (the usual default, but not necessarily the best concept).  If you are content with set-theoretic foundations using the full strength of the global [[axiom of choice]], then you can even ignore the 'non-ana' bit.


## Idea

A __strict category__ is a [[category]] with a notion of [[equality]] (not merely [[isomorphism]]) of its [[objects]].  In contrast, a __weak category__ is a category *without* an equality predicate on its objects.  When taking the [[nPOV]], we often adopt the philosophical position that [[category theory]] is fundamentally about weak categories.

In most [[foundations]] of mathematics (not only [[ZFC]] but also structural set theories such as [[ETCS]] and [[SEAR]]), every category is necessarily a strict category, because it has a [[set]] (or [[class]]) of objects, and elements of this can be compared for equality.  However, some foundations (including [[FOLDS]], [[SEAR+ε]], the [[type theories]] of Martin-Löf and Thierry Coquand, and [[preset]] theories) allow one to naturally define the term 'category' so that a category is not inherently strict.  See, for instance, [[type-theoretic definition of category]].

A __strict functor__ is a [[functor]] between strict categories that preserves equality: $F(x) = F(y)$ if $x = y$.  Again, in most foundations, this happens automatically, and one must pass to [[anafunctors]] to recover a properly weak notion of functor (although the [[axiom of choice]] shows that every anafunctor between strict categories is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to a strict functor).  Note that a [[natural transformation]] between strict functors is automatically strict.

A [[2-category]] must have strict categories as its [[hom-categories]] to write down the definition of [[strict 2-category]]; a similar remark holds for [[strict 2-functors]].  As such, strictness in the sense of this page matches and extends strictness in the usual sense of [[higher category theory]].  However, we now get a notion of __strict $2$-natural transformation__ as a [[2-natural transformation]] that preserves equality.  (All [[modifications]] between strict transformations are automatically strict ... until we get to $3$-categories, of course!)

Even if one\'s foundations allow one to notice the difference between strict categories and weak categories, the practical content disappears in the presence of the [[axiom of choice]].  (This is just like the equivalence between functors and anafunctors in that case.)


## Definition

Ignoring [[size issues]], we have a [[bicategory]] $Cat$ consisting of weak [[categories]], [[functors]] (some of wich are [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]), and [[natural transformations]] (some of which are [[natural isomorphisms]]), a [[category]] $Set$ consisting of [[sets]] and [[functions]], and a [[functor]] $Disc\colon Set \to \Cat$ taking each set to the [[discrete category]] on that set.

A __strict category__ $C$ consists of a set $Ob(C)$ (to be thought of as the set of [[objects]] of $C$), a category $Wk(C)$ (to be thought of as the underlying weak category of $C$), and an essentially surjective functor $cl(C)\colon Disc(Ob(C)) \to C$ (to be thought of as taking each object of $C$ to its [[clique]] in $C$).  A __strict functor__ $F$ from $C$ to $D$ (both strict categories) consists of a function $Ob(F)\colon Ob(C) \to Ob(D)$, a functor $Wk(F)\colon Wk(C) \to Wk(D)$, and a natural isomorphism $cl(F)\colon cl(C) ; Wk(F) \to Disc(Ob(F)) ; cl(D)$.  Strict functors $F, G\colon C \to D$ are __equal__ if $Ob(F) = Ob(G)$ and there is a (necessarily unique) natural isomorphism from $Wk(F)$ to $Wk(G)$ modulo which $cl(F)$ equals $cl(G)$.  There is an obvious notion of [[composition]] that defines a [[category]] $Str Cat$ of strict categories and strict functors.  (A natural transformation from $F$ to $G$ is simply a natural transformation from $Wk(F)$ to $Wk(G)$.)

Equivalently, a strict category is an $\mathcal{M}$-[[M-category|category]] whose underlying category of tight morphisms is discrete.


## Categories vs strict categories

In most [[foundations of mathematics]], every category $C$ is automatically a strict category: equality of objects in $C$ is simply equality in the set or class of objects of $C$.  In terms of the formal definition above, $Ob(C)$ is the ordinary set of objects of $C$, $Wk(C)$ is $C$ itself, and $cl(C)$ is the [[identity function]] on $Ob(C)$.  In [[type theory|type-theoretic]] foundations where types are interpreted as [[presets]], one normally has (following the [[type-theoretic definition of category]]) only a preset of objects instead of a set of objects, but still it is most common that every preset can be intepreted as a [[completely presented set]].

There are a few exceptions, such as [[FOLDS]], [[SEAR+ϵ]], and intensional [[dependent type]] theory without [[identity types]].  Even ignoring these, it is possible that there is still a difference between categories and strict categories, for two reasons.

First of all, just because there is a notion of equality of objects, we might not really have a strict category unless this notion behaves as [[equality]] ought.  In particular, if $a$ and $b$ are equal objects, then they ought to be [[isomorphic]] as well.  (In terms of the formal definition of strict category, this goes into the action of the functor $cl$ on morphisms.)  In [[set theory]] and [[extensional type theory]], we have this; the [[identity morphism]] $\id_a\colon a \to a$ is isomorphism $\id_a\colon a \to b$, since after all $a = b$.  But in [[intensional type theory]] (even with identity types), we are not necessarily allowed to switch the type of $\id_a$ from $a \to a$ to $a \to b$ like this.

Secondly, even if every category is automatically a strict category, it\'s possible that not every strict category arises (up to isomorphism) in this way, even using [[extensional type theory]].  For example, take the [[discrete category]] on the set of [[real numbers]].  Of course this depends on specifics, but typically, there is no type of real numbers per se but only a type of Cauchy (pre)sequences of rational numbers (see [[Cauchy real number]]).  To get the set of real numbers, we must consider this type together with a certain equivalence relation, a setoid.  The discrete category on the set of real numbers is essentially the exact same construction, now with a note that parallel morphisms are always defined to be equal.  The automatic notion of equality on the objects of this category is equality of Cauchy (pre)sequences, but the desired notion of equality for this discrete category as a strict category is isomorphism, which is equality of real numbers.  So while this category may be automatically a strict category, it is a strict category in the wrong way.

However, if we use [[higher-order type theory]] or set theory with [[power sets]], or otherwise use extensional type theory or set theory with [[quotient types]] or [[quotient sets]], then every category becomes a strict category in such a way that every discrete strict category appears; and every strict category whatsoever appears if we have the [[axiom of choice]].  (Choice is used here in essentially the same way as in the construction of a [[skeleton]].)
