## Warning

To the extent that the contents of this page are precise at all, they are speculative.  As far as I know, nobody has formulated, much less proved, the logical consistency and independence results that would justify its formal claims.

If you are content with [[set theory|set-theoretic]] foundations for category theory, you may ignore the adjective 'strict' in 'strict category'; in 'strict functor' it basically means 'non-[[anafunctor|ana]]' (the usual default, but not necessarily the best concept).  If you are content with set-theoretic foundations using the full strength of the global [[axiom of choice]], then you can even ignore the 'non-ana' bit.


## Idea

A __strict category__ is a [[category]] with a notion of [[equality]] (not merely [[isomorphism]]) of its [[objects]].  In contrast, a __weak category__ is a category *without* an equality predicate on its objects.  When taking the [[nPOV]], we often adopt the philosophical position that [[category theory]] is fundamentally about weak categories.

In most [[foundations]] of mathematics (not only [[ZFC]] but also structural set theories such as [[ETCS]] and [[SEAR]]), every category is necessarily a strict category, because it has a [[set]] (or [[class]]) of objects, and elements of this can be compared for equality.  However, some foundations (including [[FOLDS]], [[SEAR+ε]], the [[type theories]] of Martin-Löf and Thierry Coquand, and [[preset]] theories) allow one to naturally define the term 'category' so that a category is not inherently strict.  See, for instance, [[type-theoretic definition of category]].

A __strict functor__ is a [[functor]] between strict categories that preserves equality: $F(x) = F(y)$ if $x = y$.  Again, in most foundations, this happens automatically, and one must pass to [[anafunctors]] to recover a properly weak notion of functor (although the [[axiom of choice]] shows that every anafunctor between strict categories is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to a strict functor).  Note that a [[natural transformation]] between strict functors is automatically strict.

A [[2-category]] must have strict categories as its [[hom-categories]] to write down the definition of [[strict 2-category]]; a similar remark holds for [[strict 2-functors]].  As such, strictness in the sense of this page matches and extends strictness in the usual sense of [[higher category theory]].  However, we now get a notion of __strict $2$-natural transformation__ as a [[2-natural transformation]] that preserves equality.  (All [[modifications]] between strict transformations are automatically strict ... until we get to $3$-categories, of course!)

Even if one\'s foundations allow one to notice the difference between strict categories and weak categories, the practical content disappears in the presence of the [[axiom of choice]].  (This is just like the equivalence between functors and anafunctors in that case.)


## Definition

Ignoring [[size issues]], we have a [[bicategory]] $Cat$ consisting of weak [[categories]], [[functors]] (some of wich are [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]), and [[natural transformations]] (some of which are [[natural isomorphisms]]), a [[category]] $Set$ consisting of [[sets]] and [[functions]], and a [[functor]] $Disc\colon Set \to \Cat$ taking each set to the [[discrete category]] on that set.

A __strict category__ $C$ consists of a set $Ob(C)$ (to be thought of as the set of [[objects]] of $C$), a category $Wk(C)$ (to be thought of as the underlying weak category of $C$), and an essentially surjective functor $cl(C)\colon Disc(Ob(C)) \to C$ (to be thought of as taking each object of $C$ to its [[clique]] in $C$).  A __strict functor__ $F$ from $C$ to $D$ (both strict categories) consists of a function $Ob(F)\colon Ob(C) \to Ob(D)$, a functor $Wk(F)\colon Wk(C) \to Wk(D)$, and a natural isomorphism $cl(F)\colon cl(C) ; Wk(F) \to Disc(Ob(F)) ; cl(D)$.  Strict functors $F, G\colon C \to D$ are __equal__ if $Ob(F) = Ob(G)$ and there is a (necessarily unique) natural isomorphism from $Wk(F)$ to $Wk(G)$ modulo which $cl(F)$ equals $cl(G)$.  There is an obvious notion of [[composition]] that defines a [[category]] $Str Cat$ of strict categories and strict functors.  (A natural transformation from $F$ to $G$ is simply a natural transformation from $Wk(F)$ to $Wk(G)$.)

Equivalently, a strict category is an $\mathcal{M}$-[[M-category|category]] whose underlying category of tight morphisms is discrete.


## Categories vs strict categories

In most [[foundations of mathematics]], every category $C$ is automatically a strict category: equality of objects in $C$ is simply equality in the set or class of objects of $C$.  In terms of the formal definition above, $Ob(C)$ is the ordinary set of objects of $C$, $Wk(C)$ is $C$ itself, and $cl(C)$ is the [[identity function]] on $Ob(C)$.  In [[type theory|type-theoretic]] foundations where types are interpreted as [[presets]], one normally has (following the [[type-theoretic definition of category]]) only a preset of objects instead of a set of objects, but still it is most common that every preset can be intepreted as a [[completely presented set]].

There are a few exceptions, such as [[FOLDS]], [[SEAR+ϵ]], and intensional [[dependent type]] theory without [[identity types]].  Even ignoring these, it is possible that there is still a difference between categories and strict categories, for two reasons.

First of all, ...

Secondly, even if every category is automatically a strict category, it\'s possible that not every strict category arises (up to isomorphism) in this way.
