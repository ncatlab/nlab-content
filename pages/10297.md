## Idea

The [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] admits a [[soliton]] solution which is a [[string]] charged under the [[self-dual higher gauge field|self-dual]] [[B-field]]. 

Externally this is the [[boundary field theory|boundary]] of the [[M2-brane]] [[brane intersection|ending]] on the [[M5-brane]]. As such this is "the string in [[M-theory]]" and hence is also called the _[[M-string]]_.

## Properties

### Elliptic genus and M5-brane charge

The [[elliptic genus]] of the self-dual string at the boundary of the [[M2-brane]] on the [[M5-brane]] has been suggested to be directly analogous to the [[Todd genus]] of the boundary of the [[open string|open]] [[superstring]] ending on [[D-branes]] and hence has been suggested to be the _[[M5-brane charge]]_ in ([Sati 10](#Sati10)). Discussion of the computation of this elliptic genus includes ([Hohenegger-Iqbal 13](#HoheneggerIqbal13)).
