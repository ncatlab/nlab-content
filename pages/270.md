## Idea

An _$\omega$-groupoid_ is an [[∞-category]] (see there for more details) in which all [[k-morphisms]] for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ are [[equivalences]].

This is also called an _[[∞-groupoid]]_. In the literature the term "$\omega$-groupoid" is usually reserved for [[algebraic model of higher categories|algebraic]] models instead of [[geometric model of higher categories|geometric models]].

How strict the $\omega$-category and the inverses must be can vary. Somes authors that use the term '$\omega$-groupoid' mean [[strict ∞-groupoid]] by default and speak of _weak $\omega$-groupoid_ otherwise.
