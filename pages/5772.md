## Definitions

The __max-plus algebra__, or __tropical semiring__, is the [[rig]] based on the set of real numbers extended by $-\infty$ (the [[upper reals]]), with addition $x \oplus y = max(x,y)$ and multiplication $x \otimes y = x + y$.
Similarly, the __min-plus algebra__, or __rig of costs__, is the [[rig]] based on the set of real numbers extended by $\infty$ (the [[lower reals]]), with addition $x \oplus y = min(x,y)$ and multiplication $x \otimes y = x + y$.  The two rigs are isomorphic, with an [[isomorphism]] (either way) given by $x \mapsto -x$; the difference is just a matter of the desired perspective.


## Applications

The max-plus algebra is an [[idempotent semiring]] and [[dioid]] that is used in the modelling of timed systems.  Typically in a simple example, the completion time of a production system will be given by a system of equations that have 'max' occurring in them. (The next process in a system cannot start until all its component parts have been themselves completed.) The use of the max-plus notation completely linearises many systems.

The min-plus algebra may be used to draw an analogy between the use of [[action form|action]] in [[classical mechanics|classical]] vs [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] systems.  While the latter involves a [[sum of histories|sum of a multiplicative action over classical trajectories]], the former involves a [[least action principle|minimisation of an additive action over classical trajectories]].  There is a similar analogy between [[statics]] and [[statistical mechanics]].
