# Definition #

A **Galois connection** is a [[dual adjunction]] between [[partial order|poset]]s.

More explicitly, given posets $A$ and $B$, a Galois connection between $A$ and $B$ is a pair of order-reversing maps $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$ such that $a\le g(f(a))$ and $b\le f(g(b))$ for all $a\in A$, $b\in B$.

A **Galois correspondence** is a Galois connection which is an adjoint equivalence (so $a = g(f(a))$ and $b = f(g(b))$ for all $a \in A$, $b \in B$). 

# Examples #

* Frequently Galois connections between collections of [[subset]]s arise where $f(a)$ is "the set of all $y$ standing in some relation to every $x\in a$" and dually $g(b)$ is "the set of all $x$ standing in some relation to every $y\in b$."  See [[orthogonality]] for one example.

* The Galois theory normally taught in graduate-level algebra courses (and based on the work of Ã‰variste Galois) involves a Galois connection between the intermediate [[field]]s of a [[Galois extension]] and the subgroups of the corresponding [[Galois group]].
