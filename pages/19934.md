## Idea

The concept of _Riemannian orbifolds_ is the joint generalization of the concepts of _[[Riemannian manifolds]]_ and _[[orbifolds]]_:

A Riemannian orbifold is an [[orbifold]] equipped with an orbifold [[atlas]] where each [[chart]] $(\widehat{U}_i, G)$ is equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]] such that the [[action]] of $G$ is by [[isometries]], and such that the transition functions from one chart to the other are isometries.

A key aspect is that the orbifold [[singularities]] behave like carrying singular [[curvature]], notably there are [[flat orbifolds]] (i.e. Riemannian orbifolds with vanishing [[Riemann curvature]] away from the [[singularities]]) whose underlying [[topological spaces]] are [[n-spheres]].

## Examples



Basic examples of Riemannian orbifolds are [[conical singularities]] such as [[ADE-singularities]].

The flat [[compact topological space|compact]]  2-dimensional orbifolds may be classified via the [[wallpaper groups]] (...):
