## Definition

For $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, the _$k$-stem_ of the [[homotopy groups of spheres]] is the collection of [[homotopy groups]] of the form $\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, together with the [[suspension]] maps between them.

For $n \gt k + 1$ these groups stabilize and yield the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].
