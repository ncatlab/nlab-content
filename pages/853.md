## Idea

The notion of a _constant morphism_ in a [[category]] generalises the notion of [[constant function]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #ConstMorph}
###### Definition
A _constant morphism_ in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[morphism]] $c : B \to C$ with the property that if $f,g : A \to B$ are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ then $c \circ f = c \circ g$.
=--
In other words, $c$ is a constant morphism if the function $c_* \colon \mathcal{C}(A,B) \to \mathcal{C}(A,C)$ given by composition with $c$ is a [[constant function]] for every object $A$.

Another definition that is sometimes used is the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #ConstTerm}
###### Definition
A morphism $c \colon B \to C$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is constant if it factors through the [[terminal object]] of $\mathcal{C}$.
=--

This second definition implies the first, but they are not equivalent in general.  In the [[category of sets]] the first implies the second if the set $B$ is nonempty.  More generally, if $c \colon B \to C$ is a morphism in a category $\mathcal{C}$, then the two definitions are equivalent if $\mathcal{C}(X,B)$ is nonempty for every $X$.  If $\mathcal{C}$ has a terminal object $1$, then this is equivalent to there being a [[global section]] $b \colon 1 \to B$.

See the [forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2689) for further discussion of this.

## Examples

Using the two-point set, it is simple to show that the constant morphisms in [[Set]] are precisely the constant functions.
