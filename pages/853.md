## Idea

The notion of a _constant morphism_ in a [[category]] generalises the notion of [[constant function]].


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #ConstMorph}
###### Definition
A __constant morphism__ in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[morphism]] $c\colon B \to C$ with the property that if $f,g\colon A \to B$ are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ then $c \circ f = c \circ g$.  In other words, for every object $A$, *at most* one morphism from $A$ to $C$ factors through $f$.
=--

Thus, $c$ is a constant morphism if the function $c_* \colon \mathcal{C}(A,B) \to \mathcal{C}(A,C)$ given by composition with $c$ is a [[constant function]] for every object $A$.

Another definition that is sometimes used is the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #ConstTerm}
###### Definition
A morphism $c\colon B \to C$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is __constant__ if, for every object $A$, *exactly* one morphism from $A$ to $C$ factors through $f$.  Assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ has a [[terminal object]], $f$ is constant iff it factors through this terminal object.
=--

This second definition implies the first, but they are not equivalent in general.  In the [[category of sets]], the first implies the second if the set $B$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].  More generally, if $c\colon B \to C$ is a morphism in a category $\mathcal{C}$, then the two definitions are equivalent if $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is inhabited for every $A$.  If $\mathcal{C}$ has a terminal object $1$, then this is equivalent to the existence of a [[global section]] $b\colon 1 \to B$.

See the [forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2689) for further discussion of this.


## Relation to (sub)terminal objects

The [[identity morphism]] on an object $B$ satisfies definition 1 if and only if $B$ is [[subterminal object|subterminal]]; it satisfies definition 2 iff $B$ is [[terminal object|terminal]].


## Examples

Using the two-point set, it is simple to show that the constant morphisms in [[Set]] are precisely the constant functions.
