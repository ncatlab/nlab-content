## Idea

Banach coalgebras (or cogebras) are like [[Banach algebras]], but [[coalgebras]].  The [[dual space|dual]] of a Banach coalgebra is a Banach algebra (but not conversely).  We can also consider Banach [[bialgebras]] (or bigebras).


## Definitions

A __Banach coalgebra__, or __Banach cogebra__, is a [[comonoid object]] in the [[monoidal category]] $Ban$ of [[Banach spaces]] with [[short linear maps]] and the [[projective tensor product]].  (Recall that a [[Banach algebra]] is a [[monoid object]] in $Ban$.)

Explicitly, we have:
1.  a [[Banach space]] $A$
2.  a [[short linear map]], the __comultiplication__:
    $$ \Delta\colon A \to A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A $$
    to the [[projective tensor product]];
3.  a short [[linear functional]], the __counit__:
    $$ \epsilon\colon A \to K ,$$
    where $K$ is the [[ground field]];
4.  an [[equation]], the __coassociativity__:
    $$ (\Delta \hat{\otimes}_\pi \id_A) \Delta x = (\id_A \hat{\otimes}_\pi \Delta) \Delta x \in (A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A) \hat{\otimes}_\pi A \cong A \hat{\otimes}_\pi (A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A)$$
    for each $x\colon A$;
5.  an equation, the __left coidentity__:
    $$ (\epsilon \hat{\otimes}_\pi \id_A) \Delta x = 1 \otimes x \in K \hat{\otimes}_\pi A$$
    for each $x\colon A$;
6.  and an equation, the __right coidentity__:
    $$ (\id_A \hat{\otimes}_\pi \epsilon) \Delta x = x \otimes 1 \in A \hat{\otimes}_\pi K$$
    for each $x\colon A$.

Technically, we\'ve defined a __counital coassociative Banach coalgebra__.  We can leave out (3,5,6) to get a __non-counital Banach coalgebra__, and (also) leave out (4) to get a __non-coassociative Banach coalgebra__.  Warning: these terms are examples of the [[red herring principle]].

To __freely adjoin a counit__ to a non-counital Banach coalgebra $A$, take the Banach space $A \oplus_1 K$ (using the $l^1$-[[l-1-direct sum|direct sum]]), let $\Delta_{A \oplus K} (x,c)$ be $(\Delta_A x, 0, 0, c) \in (A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A) \oplus_1 A \oplus_1 A \oplus_1 K \cong (A \oplus_1 K) \hat{\otimes}_\pi (A \oplus_1 K)$, and let $\epsilon_{A \oplus_1 K} (x,c)$ be $c$.  Then $A \oplus_1 K$ is a counital Banach coalgebra.

On the other hand, we can *add* the requirement of __cocommutativity__:

*  $\tau \Delta x = \Delta x$ for each $x\colon A$,

where $\tau\colon A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A \to A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A$ is generated by $\tau (u \otimes v) = v \otimes u$.  Then we have a __cocommutative Banach coalgebra__.

The [[category]] __$Ban Coalg$__ of Banach coalgebras has, as [[objects]], Banach coalgebras and, as [[morphisms]], [[short linear maps]] $f\colon A \to B$ with equations
$$ \Delta_B f x = (f \otimes f) \Delta_A x $$
and
$$ \epsilon_B f x = \epsilon_A x $$
for all $x\colon A$.  Warning: the term 'homomorphism' is used more generally; see below.

If $A$ and $B$ are Banach coalgebras, then their __[[projective tensor product]]__ $A \hat{\otimes}_\pi B$ is a Banach coalgebra, generated by
$$ \Delta_{A \hat{\otimes}_\pi B} (x \otimes y) = \Delta_A x \otimes \Delta_B y \in (A \otimes A) \otimes (B \otimes B) \cong (A \otimes B) \otimes (A \otimes B) $$
and
$$ \epsilon_{A \hat{\otimes}_\pi B} (x \otimes y) = (\epsilon_A x) (\epsilon_B y) \in K .$$

Similarly (but more simply), the [[ground field]] $K$ is itself a Banach coalgebra, with $\Delta$ and $\epsilon$ both essentially the [[identity map]].

A __Banach bialgebra__, or __Banach bigebra__, is a [[bimonoid]] in $Ban$: a Banach space $A$ equipped with the structures of both a [[Banach algebra]] and a Banach coalgebra, such that $\Delta$ and $\epsilon$ are both morphisms of Banach algebras, or equivalently such that the multiplication and unit of the Banach algebra are both morphisms of Banach coalgebras.  Explicitly, this requirement is:
*  $\Delta (x y) = (\Delta x) (\Delta y)$ (with the induced multiplication on $A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A$),
*  $\Delta 1 = 1 \otimes 1$ (which is the identity in $A \otimes A$),
*  $\epsilon (x y) = (\epsilon x) (\epsilon y)$ (with the multiplication on the right in $K$), and
*  $\epsilon 1 = 1$ (with the $1$ on the right in $K$).

The category __$Ban Bialg$__ of Banach bialgebras has, as objects, Banach bialgebras and, as morphisms, short linear maps that are morphisms of both Banach algebras and Banach coalgebras.


## Dual Banach algebras

If $A$ is a Banach coalgebra, then the [[dual space]] $A^*$ is a [[Banach algebra]].  Actually, this is more general than $A^* = [A,K]$; if $B$ is any Banach algebra, then so is the $[A,B]$ (the Banach space of [[bounded linear maps]] from $A$ to $B$).

This result is nothing special about Banach (co)algebras; it holds in any [[closed monoidal category]].  The multiplication operation in $[A,B]$ is given by
$$ (\lambda \mu) x = m (\lambda \otimes \mu) \Delta x ,$$
where $m\colon B \otimes B \to B$ is (generated by) the multiplication operation on $B$.  $[A,B]$ is associative, unital, or commutative if $A$ and $B$ are (with 'co‑' in the names of $A$\'s properties).  In particular, $A^*$ has one of these properties iff $A$ has the corresponding property.

Note that $[B,A]$ (or even $B^*$) is *not*, in general, a Banach coalgebra.  (That\'s because $Ban$ is closed, not [[coclosed category|coclosed]].)
