## Idea

Banach coalgebras (or cogebras) are like [[Banach algebras]], but [[coalgebras]].  The [[dual space|dual]] of a Banach coalgebra is a Banach algebra (but not conversely).  We can also consider Banach [[bialgebras]] (or bigebras).


## Definitions

Recall that a [[Banach algebra]] is a [[monoid object]] in the [[Ban]].

###### Definition

A __Banach coalgebra__, or __Banach cogebra__, is a [[comonoid object]] in the [[monoidal category]] of [[Banach spaces]] with [[short linear maps]] and the [[projective tensor product]].
=--

Explicitly, we have:
1.  a [[Banach space]] $A$
2.  a [[short linear map]], the __comultiplication__:
    $$ \Delta\colon A \to A \hat{\otimes}_\pi A ;$$
3.  a short [[linear functional]], the __counit__:
    $$ \epsilon\colon A \to K ,$$
    where $K$ is the [[ground field]];
4.  an [[equation]], the __coassociativity__:
    $$ (\Delta \hat{\otimes}_\pi \id_A)(\Delta(x)) = (\id_A \hat{\otimes}_\pi \Delta)(\Delta(x)) $$
    for each $x\colon A$;
5.  an equation, the __left coidentity__:
    $$ (\epsilon \hat{\otimes}_\pi \id_A)(\Delta(x)) = 1 \otimes x $$
    for each $x\colon A$;
6.  and an equation, the __right coidentity__:
    $$ (\id_A \hat{\otimes}_\pi \epsilon)(\Delta(x)) = x \otimes 1 $$
    for each $x\colon A$.

Technically, we\'ve defined a __counital coassociative Banach coalgebra__.  We can leave out (3,5,6) to get a __nonunital Banach coalgebra__, and (also) leave out (4) to get a __nonassociative Banach coalgebra__.

On the other hand, we can add __cocommutativity__:

*  $\tau(\Delta(x)) = \Delta(x)$ for each $x\colon A$,

where $\tau$ is generated by $\tau(u \otimes v) = v \otimes u$.  Then we have a __cocommutative Banach coalgebra__.
