#Idea#

For $X$ a smooth space, there are useful refinements of the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ which remember more than just the homotopy class of paths, i.e. whose morphisms are (piecewise, say) smooth paths in $X$ modulo an equivalence relation still strong enough to induce a groupoid structure, but weaker than dividing out homotopies relative to endpoints.

#Definition#

Let $X$ be a smooth [[manifold]].

+--{: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For $\gamma_1, \gamma_2  : [0,1] \to X$ two smooth maps, a **thin-homotopy** $\gamma_1 \Rightarrow \gamma_2$ is a smooth homotopy, i.e. a smooth map
$$
  \Sigma : [0,1]^2 \to X
$$
with 

* $\Sigma(0,-) = \gamma_1$
* $\Sigma(1,-) = \gamma_2$
* $\Sigma(-,0) = \gamma_1(0) = \gamma_2(0)$
* $\Sigma(-,1) = \gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(1)$

which is _thin_ in that it doesn't sweep out any surface: every $2$-form pulled back to it vanishes:

* $\forall B \in \Omega^2(X) : \Sigma^* B = 0$.

######Definition
A path $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ has **sitting instants** if there is a neighbourhood of the boundary of $[0,1]$ such that $\gamma$ is constant restricted to that.
=--

+--{: .un_defn}
######Definition
The **path groupoid** $P_1(X)$ has

* $Obj(P_1(X)) = X$
* $P_1(X)(x,y) = \{$thin-homotopy classes of paths $\gamma : x \to y $ with sitting instants $\}$.

Composition of paths comes from concatenation and reparameterization of representatives. The quotient by thin-homotopy ensures that this yields an associative composition with inverses for each path.

This definition makes sense for $X$ any [[generalized smooth space]], in particular for $X$ a [[sheaf]] on [[Diff]]. 

Moreover, $P_1(X)$ is always itself naturally a groupoid [[internal category|internal to]] [[generalized smooth space]]s: if $X$ is a [[Chen space]] or [[diffeological space]] then $P_1(X)$ is itself internal to that category.

#Remarks#

If $G$ is a Lie group, then internal (i.e. smooth) functors from the path groupoid to the one-object Lie groupoid corresponding to $G$ are in bijection to $Lie(G)$-valued differential forms on $X$. With gauge transformations regarded as morphisms between Lie-algebra values differential forms, this extends naturally to an equivalence of categories
$$
  [P_1(X), \mathbf{B}G] \simeq \Omega^2(X, Lie(G))
$$
where on the left the [[functor category]] is the one of internal (smooth) functors.

More generally, smooth [[anafunctor]]s from $P_1(X)$ to $\mathbf{B}G$ are canonically equivalent to smooth $G$-principal bundles on $X$:
$$
  Ana(P_1(X), \mathbf{B}G) \simeq G Bund_\nabla(X)
  \,.
$$
