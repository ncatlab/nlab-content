## Idea

In [[probability theory]] a _random variable_ or _stochastic variable_ is meant to be quantity that is subject to random variation.

## Definition

The modern formalization of this idea ([Kolmogorov 33, III](#Kolmogorov33)) is to take a random variable to be a [[measurable function]] $f$ on a [[probability space]] $(X,\mu)$ (e.g. [Grigoryan 08, 3.2](#Grigoryan08), [Dembo 12, 1.2.1](#Dembo12)). 

One thinks of $X$ as the space of all possible configurations (all the "[[possible worlds]]" with respect to the idealized situation under consideration), thinks of the measure $\mu(U)$ of any [[subset]] of it as the [[probability]] that one of the configurations $x \in U \subset X$ is _randomly_ realized, and thinks of $f(x)$ as the value of the given random variable in the situation of that configuration.

Accordingly for instance the [[expectation value]] of the random variable $f$ is the [[integral]]

$$
  \langle f \rangle \coloneqq \int_X f \cdot \mu
$$

of $f$ against the [[probability measure]], i.e. the average value of the random variable over all possible configuration, weighted by their [[probability]].

## Properties

### Relation to type theoretic constructions

There is at least some similarity of the concept of random variables to usage of the [[function monad]] ("[[reader monad]]") in the context of [[monad (in computer science)|monads in computer science]]. 

This point of view is expressed for instance in ([Toronto-McCarthy 10, p. 24](#TorontoMcCarthy10)).

In [Verdier 14](#Verdier14) it says:

> The intuition behind the Reader monad, for a mathematician, is perhaps stochastic variables. A stochastic variable is a function from a probability space to some other space. So we see a stochastic variable as a monadic value.
