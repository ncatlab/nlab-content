## Idea

In [[probability theory]] a _random variable_ is meant to be quantity that is subject to random variation.

## Definition

The modern formalization of this idea is to take a random variable to be a [[measurable function]] $f$ on a [[probability space]] $(X,\mu)$. One thinks of $X$ as the space of all possible configurations (all the "[[possible worlds]]" with respect to the idealized situation under consideration), thinks of the measure $\mu(U)$ of any [[subset]] of it as the [[probability]] that one of the configurations $x \in U \subset X$ is _randomly_ realized, and thinks of $f(x)$ as the value of the given random variable in the situation of that configuration.

Accordingly for instance the [[expectation value]] of the random variable $f$ is the [[integral]]

$$
  \langle f \rangle \coloneqq \int_X f \cdot \mu
$$

of $f$ against the [[probability measure]], i.e. the average value of the random variable over all possible configuration, weighted by their [[probability]].
