## Idea

The _deduction theorem_ in [[formal logic]] says (when it holds) that if in some [[logical framework]] there is a [[proof]] by [[deduction]] of some [[proposition]] $B$ from the [[premise]] $A$, then there is also a proof of the [[conditional statement]] $A \to B$ (from no premises).

This seems obvious, but there are formal logical systems where this fails, for instance in the original Birkhoff-vonNeumann [[quantum logic]].  On the other hand, it may be taken as an [[axiom]]; it is the [[introduction rule]] for the conditional operator in [[natural deduction]].
