## Idea

The _deduction theorem_in [[formal logic]] says (when it holds) that if in some [[logical framework]] there is a [[proof]] by [[deduction]] of some [[proposition]] $B$ from assumptions $A$, then there is also a proof of the [[implication]] $A \to B$.

This seems obvious, but there are formal logical system where this fails, for instance in the original Birkhoff-vonNeumann [[quantum logic]].
