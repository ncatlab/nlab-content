[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: can anyone point me to -- or write an entry containing -- a discussion of systematical "homotopical enrichment" where we enrich over a [[homotopical category]] systematically weakening everything up to coherent homotopy. If/when we have this we should also link it to [[(infinity,n)-category]], as that is built by iteratively doing homotopical enrichement starting with [[Top]].

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: If anyone ever does anything like that, I would love to see it.  As far as I know there is no general theory.  You can define [[Segal category|Segal categories]] in any homotopical category with finite products.  You can define [[complete Segal space|complete Segal spaces]] in any model category, at least, and less may suffice. And you can define $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-category|categories]] in any monoidal homotopical category.  But the problem is finding some way to get a handle on them, like lifting a model structure to them. Of course, people have iterated the existing definitions to get notions of $n$-category and of $(\infty,n)$-category (Simpson-Tamsamani, Trimble, Barwick, Lurie, etc), but I've never seen a general theory.  Peter May and I have been planning for a while to think about iterating enriched $A_\infty$-categories.
