## Idea

The _Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence_ (AHSS) is a type of [[spectral sequence]] that generalizes the [[Serre spectral sequence]] from [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^\bullet$ to any [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory $E^\bullet$.

For any ([[finite homotopy type|finite]]) [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    F &\longrightarrow& P
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

then the corresponding $E$-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence has on its second page the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in the $E$-[[cohomology groups]] of the [[fiber]] and converges to the proper $E$-cohomology of the total space:

$$
  E_2^{p,q} =
  H^p(X,E^q(F))
  \Rightarrow
  E^{\bullet}(P)
  \,.
$$

This is of interest already for $F \simeq \ast$, as then it expresses generalized cohomology in terms of cordinary cohomology with coefficients in the base cohomology ring.

###### Remark
**(note on terminology)** 

Often the terminology "Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence" is taken to refer to only this case with $F = \ast$, while the general case is then referred to as "Serre spectral sequence for generalized cohomology" or similar. In ([Atiyah-Hirzebruch 61,p. 17](#AtiyahHirzebruch61)) the case $F = \ast$ is labeled "Theorem", while the general case, stated right after the theorem, is labeled "2.2 Remark". 

The proof of the theorem that is given is very short, it just says that since topological K-theory satisfies the [exactness axiom](generalized+%28Eilenberg-Steenrod%29+cohomology#ExactnessUnreduced)  of a generalized cohomology theory, it is immediate that the conditions for a spectral sequence stated as Axioms (SP.1)-(SP.5) in ([Cartan-Eilenberg 56, section XV.7](#CartanEilenberg56)) are met. Indeed Example 2 in ([Cartan-Eilenberg 56, section XV.7](#CartanEilenberg56)) observes that the spectral sequence in question exists for $E =$ [[ordinary cohomology]] because "Axioms (SP.1)-(SP.4) are consequences of usual properties of cohomology groups". That makes the generalization of the example to [[generalized cohomology theories]], which _by definition_ satisy these "usual properties", immediate. 

In view of this, the contribution of ([Atiyah-Hirzebruch 61](#AtiyahHirzebruch61)) would not be so much the observation of what is now called the AHSS, rather than the proof that K-theory satisfies the axioms of a generalized cohomology theory. Indeed, according to ([Adams 74, p. 127-128, 215](#Adams74)), the AHSS was earlier observed by [[George Whitehead]] and "then became a folk-theorem" which was "eventually published by Atiyah and Hirzebruch".

Maybe it should be called the "Cartan-Eilenberg-Whitehead spectral sequence".

There is a generalization to [[equivariant cohomology theory]] ([Davis-Lueck 98, theorem 4.7](#DavisLueck98)).

For [[genuine G-spectrum|genuine G-equivariance]], with [[RO(G)-grading]] for [[representation spheres]] $S^V$, then for $P \to X$ an $F$-fibration of [[topological G-spaces]] and for $A$ any $G$-[[Mackey functor]], the equivariant Serre spectral sequence looks like ([Kronholm 10, theorem 3.1](#Kronholm10)):

$$
  E_2^{p,q} = H^p(X, H^{V+q}(F,A)) \,\Rightarrow\, H^{V+p+q}(P,A)
  \,,
$$

where on the left in the $E_2$-page we have [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the genuine equivariant cohomology groups of the fiber.


## Construction

## Properties

### Multiplicative structure

for $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then the AHSS is multiplicative...

([MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/q/225579/381))

## Examples and Applications

### To complex oriented cohomology theory

...([Adams 74](#Adams74))....

### For topological K-theory
 {#ForKTheory}

For $E = $ [[KU]], hence for [[topological K-theory]], the differential $d_3$ of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence with $F = \ast$ is given by a [[Steenrod square]] operation

$$
  d_3 = Sq^3
$$

([Atiyah-Hirzebruch 61](#AtiyahHirzebruch61)).

For [[twisted K-theory]] this picks up in addition the [[cup product]] with the 3-class $H$ of the twist:

$$
  d_3 = Sq^3 + H \cup(-)
$$

([Rosenberg 82](#Rosenberg82), [Atiyah-Segal 05 (4.1)](#AtiyahSegal05)). The higher differentials $d_5$ and $d_7$ here are given by higher [[Massey products]] with the twisting class ([Atiyah-Segal 05 sections 5-7](#AtiyahSegal05)).


### D-brane charges in string theory
 {#ApplicationDBraneChargesInStringTheory}

In [[string theory]] [[D-brane charges]] are classes in $E = KU$-cohomology, i.e. in [[K-theory]]. The second page of of the corresponding Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (see [above](#ForKTheory)) for $F = \ast$ hence expresses ordinary cohomology in all even or all odd degrees, and being in the kernel of all the differentials is hence the constraint on such ordinary cohomology data to lift to genuine K-theory classes, hence to genuine D-brane charges. In this way the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences is used in ([Maldacena-Moore-Seiberg 01](#MaldacenaMooreSeiberg01), [Evslin-Sati 06](#EvslinSati06))

Whitehead, but he got them just after he wrote the paper $[$Whitehead 56 'Homotopy groups of joins and unions'$]$ in which they ought to have appeared.
