## Idea

The _Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence_ is a kind of [[spectral sequence]] that generalizes the [[Serre spectral sequence]] from [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^\bullet$ to any [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory $E^\bullet$.

For any [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    F &\longrightarrow& P
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

then the corresponding $E$-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence has on its second page the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in the $E$-[[cohomology groups]] of the [[fiber]] and coverges to the proper $E$-cohomology of the total space:

$$
  E_2^{p,q} =
  H^p(X,E^q(F))
  \Rightarrow
  E^{\bullet}(P)
  \,.
$$

This is of interest already for $F \simeq \ast$, as then it expresses generalized cohomology in terms of cordinary cohomology with coefficients in the base cohomology ring.

There is a generalization to [[equivariant cohomology theory]] ([Davis-Lueck 98, theorem 4.7](#DavisLueck98)).

## Examples

### For K-theory
 {#ForKTheory}

For $E = $ [[KU]], hence for [[topological K-theory]], the differential $d_3$ of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence with $F = \ast$ is given by a [[Steenrod square]] operation

$$
  d_3 = Sq^3
$$

([Atiyah-Hirzebruch 61](#AtiyahHirzebruch61)).

For [[twisted K-theory]] this picks up in addition the [[cup product]] with the 3-class $H$ of the twist:

$$
  d_3 = Sq^3 + H \cup(-)
$$

([Rosenberg 82](#Rosenberg82), [Atiyah-Segal 05 (4.1)](#AtiyahSegal05)). The higher differentials $d_5$ and $d_7$ here are given by higher [[Massey products]] with the twisting class ([Atiyah-Segal 05 sections 5-7](#AtiyahSegal05)).


## Applications

### D-brane charges in string theory
 {#ApplicationDBraneChargesInStringTheory}

In [[string theory]] [[D-brane charges]] are classes in $E = KU$-cohomology, i.e. in [[K-theory]]. The second page of of the corresponding Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (see [above](#ForKTheory)) for $F = \ast$ hence expresses ordinary cohomology in all even or all odd degrees, and being in the kernel of all the differentials is hence the constraint on such ordinary cohomology data to lift to genuine K-theory classes, hence to genuine D-brane charges. In this way the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences is used in ([Maldacena-Moore-Seiberg 01](#MaldacenaMooreSeiberg01), [Evslin-Sati 06](#EvslinSati06))
