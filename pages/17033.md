## Idea

The [[spectral sequence]] induced from the [[filtration]] given by the [[Goodwillie-Taylor tower]].

## Application

### To homotopy groups of spheres

Applied to the identity functor at the point, the Goodwillie spectral sequence computes [[homotopy groups of spheres]] and as such interacts with the [[EHP spectral sequence]], this is discussed in [Behrens 10](#Behrens10)
