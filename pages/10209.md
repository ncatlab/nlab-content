## Definition

The *compact symplectic group* is the [[simply-connected]], maximal [[compact]] real [[Lie group]] $Sp(n)$ sitting inside the complex [[symplectic group]] $Sp(2n,\mathbb{C})$. It can also be seen as the [[orthogonal group of an inner product space|othogonal group]] of $\mathbb{H}^n$. It should not be confused with the [[symplectic group]] $Sp(2n,\mathbb{R})$, which is not simply-connected.

## Examples

* The group $Sp(1)$ is isomorphic to $SU(2)$ and also to the [[spin group]] $Spin(3)$. Its underlying manifold is the 3-[[sphere]].

* $Sp(2)$ is isomorphic to $Spin(5)$.
