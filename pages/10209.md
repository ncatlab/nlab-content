## Definition

The __compact symplectic group__ (in $n$ dimensions) is the [[simply-connected]], maximal [[compact]] real [[Lie group]] $Sp(n)$ sitting inside the complex [[symplectic group]] $Sp(2n,\mathbb{C})$. It can also be seen as the [[orthogonal group of an inner product space|orthogonal group]] of $\mathbb{H}^n$. It may also be defined as the [[intersection]] of $Sp(2n,\mathbb{C})$ with the [[unitary group]] $\mathrm{U}(2n) = \mathrm{U}(2n,\mathbb{C})$ within the [[general linear group]] $GL(2n,\mathbb{C})$.  It should *not* be confused with the real [[symplectic group]] $Sp(2n,\mathbb{R})$ (which is not simply-connected).


## Examples

* The group $Sp(1)$ is isomorphic to the [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$ and also to the [[spin group]] $Spin(3)$. Its underlying [[smooth manifold]] is the 3-[[sphere]].

* $Sp(2)$ is isomorphic to $Spin(5)$.
