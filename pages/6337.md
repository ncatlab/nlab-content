## Idea

The _genus_ of a [[surface]] (2-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifold]]) is an [[integer]] that helps classify the surface's [[homeomorphism]] class.  It gives the number of handles or 'cross caps' that are in a sum decomposition of the surface.


In [[complex analytic geometry]] a surface, being complex 1-dimensional, is called a [[complex curves]] and so one speaks of the [[genus of a curve]]. This holds also for [[algebraic curves]]. Even in [[arithmetic geometry]], there is _[[genus of a number field]]_.
