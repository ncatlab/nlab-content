## Idea

**Steiner systems** are combinatorial objects whose main applications are in finite geometries and finite group theory. 

Given positive integers $l,n,m$ a __Steiner system__ of type $S(l,n,m)$ is a pair of a set $S$ of cardinality $n$ and a set of subsets of $S$ of cardinality $m$, called blocks, such that every $l$-element subset of $S$ is in precisely one block. 

Nontrivial Steiner systems occur for $1\lt l\lt n\lt m$. 

Special cases are the $S(2,3,n)$, called _Steiner triple systems_, and the $S(3,4,n)$, called _Steiner quadruple systems_. 

The simple sporadic [[Mathieu groups]] arise as [[automorphism groups]] of certain Steiner systems. For instance, the largest, $M_24$, is composed by the automorphisms of $S(5,8,24)$.
