Steiner systems are combinatorial objects with main applications in finite geometries and finite group theory. 

Given positive integers $l,n,m$ a __Steiner system__ of type $S(l,n,m)$ is a pair of a set $S$ of cardinality $n$ and a set of subsets of $S$ of cardinality $m$, called blocks, such that every $l$-element subset of $S$ is in precisely one block. 

Nontrivial Steiner systems occur for $1\lt l\lt n\lt m$. 

Special cases are $S(2,3,n)$-s called __Steiner triple systems__ and $S(3,4,n)$-s called Steiner quadruple systems.
