An **ordinary differential equation** is a [[differential equation]] involving derivatives of a function with respect to one argument only, i.e. the function is on a [[manifold]] of only $1$ [[dimension]]. This function can be vector valued, what is sometimes viewed as a system of possibly coupled equations; still all of them have the derivatives taken with respect to the same parameter.

## Existence and uniqueness (Picard-Lindel&ouml;f theorem) 

A basic theorem concerns existence and uniqueness of local solutions to initial value problems. Let $X$ be a [[Banach space]]; denote the ball of radius $r$ about $x \in X$ by $B_r(x)$. Given $(t_0, x_0) \in \mathbb{R} \times X$ and $a, r \gt 0$, put $Q(a, r) \coloneqq [t_0 - a, t_0 + a] \times B_r(x_0)$.

###### Theorem 
**(Picard-Lindel&ouml;f)** 
Suppose $f: Q(a, b) \to X$ is a continuous function satisfying the following conditions: 

* (Lipschitz condition) There is a Lipschitz constant $L$ such that 
$$\|f(t, x) - f(t, x')\| \leq L\|x - x'\|$$ 
for all $(t, x) \in Q(a, b)$; 

* (Boundedness) There is a constant $K$ such that $\sup_{(t, x) \in Q(a, b)} \|f(t, x)\| \leq K$. 

Then for any $y_0 \in X$ and $c \coloneqq \min(a, b/K)$, there exists exactly one solution $y: [t_0 - c, t_0 + c] \to X$ to the initial value problem 

$$y'(t) = f(t, y(t)), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.$$
