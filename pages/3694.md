An **ordinary differential equation** is a [[differential equation]] involving derivatives of a function with respect to one argument only, i.e. the function is on a [[manifold]] of only $1$ [[dimension]]. This function can be vector valued, what is sometimes viewed as a system of possibly coupled equations; still all of them have the derivatives taken with respect to the same parameter.
