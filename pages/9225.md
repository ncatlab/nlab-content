## Idea

A _Beilinson-Drinfeld algebra_ (or _BD-algebra_ for short) is like a [[BV-algebra]], but over [[formal power series]] in one formal parameter $\hbar$, and with the [[Gerstenhaber algebra|Gerstenhaber bracket]] is proportional to that parameter. 

This means that on may think of a BD-algebra as an $\hbar$-parameterized formal family of algebras which for $\hbar = 0$ are [[Poisson 0-algebras]] and for $\hbar \neq 0$ are [[BV-algebras]] (maybe without the condition that the [[BV-operator]] is a derivation for the bracket).

Such BD-algbras are used to formalize [[formal deformation quantization]] in the context of the [[BV-BRST formalism]].

###### Definition

A **quantum BV complex** or **Beilinson-Drinfeld algebra** is a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra|graded]] [[supercommutative superalgebra|graded-commutative algebra]] $A$ over the ring $\mathbb{R} [ [ \hbar ] ]$ of [[formal power series]] in a formal constant $\hbar$, equipped with a [[Poisson 0-algebra|Poisson bracket]] $\{-,-\}$ of degree 1 and with an operator $\Delta \colon A \to A$ of degree 1 which satisfies:

1. $\Delta^2 = 0$

1. $\Delta( a b) = (\Delta a) b  + (-1)^{\vert a\vert} a \Delta b + \hbar \{a,b\}$ for all homogenous elements $a, b \in A$

This is [[algebra over an operad]] over the [[BD operad]].
