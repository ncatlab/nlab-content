## Idea

An [[algebra over an operad]] over the [[BD operad]].

For the moment see at _[[BV-complex]]_

###### Remark

Beware that the definition of BD-algebra is very similar to that of _[[BV-algebra]]_, but there is a crucial difference in sign in the grading of the bracket (e.g. [Gwilliam 13, footnote 7](#Gwilliam13)). Beware that, confusingly, it is the BD-algebras, not the [[BV-algebras]], which control [[BV-formalism]] in [[field theory]].

## Definition

###### Definition

A **quantum BV complex** or **Beilinson-Drinfeld algebra** is a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra]] $A$ over the ring $\mathbb{R} [ [ \hbar ] ]$ of [[formal power series]] in a formal constant $\hbar$, equipped with a [[Poisson 0-algebra|Poisson bracket]] $\{-,-\}$ of degree 1 and with an operator $\Delta \colon A \to A$ of degree 1 which satisfies:

1. $\Delta^2 = 0$

1. $\Delta( a b) = (\Delta a) b  + (-1)^{\vert a\vert} a \Delta b + \hbar \{a,b\}$ for all homogenous elements $a, b \in A$

In ([Gwilliam 2013](#Gwilliam)) this is def. 2.2.5.
