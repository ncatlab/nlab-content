###### Definition

A **quantum BV complex** or **Beilinson-Drinfeld algebra** is a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra]] $A$ over the ring $\mathbb{R} [ [ \hbar ] ]$ of [[formal power series]] in a formal constant $\hbar$, equipped with a [[Poisson 0-algebra|Poisson bracket]] $\{-,-\}$ of degree 1 and with an operator $\Delta \colon A \to A$ of degree 1 which satisfies:

1. $\Delta^2 = 0$

1. $\Delta( a b) = (\Delta a) b  + (-1)^{\vert a\vert} a \delta b + \{a,b\}$ for all homogenous elements $a, b \in A$
