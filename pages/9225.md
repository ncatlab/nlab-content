## Idea

A _Beilinson-Drinfeld algebra_ (or _BD-algebra_ for short) is like a [[BV-algebra]] with nilpotent [[BV-operator]], but over [[formal power series]] in one formal parameter $\hbar$, and such that the [[Gerstenhaber algebra|Gerstenhaber bracket]] is proportional to that parameter. 

This means that one may think of a BD-algebra as an $\hbar$-parameterized formal family of algebras which for $\hbar = 0$ are [[Poisson 0-algebras]] and for $\hbar \neq 0$ they look superficially like [[BV-algebras]]. But see remark \ref{RoleOfTheDifferential} below.

Such BD-algbras are used to formalize [[formal deformation quantization]] in the context of the [[BV-BRST formalism]] (in [Costello-Gwilliam](#CostelloGwilliam)).



## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #BeilinsonDrinfelAlgebra}
###### Definition

A **quantum BV complex** or **Beilinson-Drinfeld algebra** is 

1. a [[differential graded-commutative algebra]] $A$ (whose [[differential]] we denote by $\Delta$) over the ring $\mathbb{R} [ [ \hbar ] ]$ of [[formal power series]] over the [[real numbers]] in a formal constant $\hbar$, 

1. equipped with a [[Poisson 0-algebra|Poisson bracket]] $\{-,-\}$ of the same degree as the differential

such that 

* the following equation holds for all elements $a,b \in A$ of homogeneous degree ${\vert a\vert}, {\vert b\vert} \in \mathbb{Z}$

  $$
    \Delta( a \cdot b) = (\Delta a) \cdot b  + (-1)^{\vert a\vert} a \Delta b + \hbar \{a,b\}$ for all homogenous elements $a, b \in A
    \,.
  $$

###### Remark

If in the equation in def. \ref{BeilinsonDrinfelAlgebra} one replaces $\hbar$ by 1, then it takes the form characteristic of a [[BV-algebra]]. However the differential $\Delta$ here is the differential in the underlying [[chain complex]] for an [[algebra over an operad]] in chain complexes, while in a BV-algebra $\Delta$ is the unary operation encoded in the [[BV-operad]], hence present already for algebras in plain modules/chain complexes over that operad. Accordingly, in the context of BD-algebra then for $\hbar \neq 0$ the bracket is actually trivial up to homotopy.
