## Idea

For $\mathcal{T}$ a [[sheaf topos]], $G \in Grp(\mathcal{T})$ a [[group object]] and $V \in \mathcal{T}$ any object, and for $\rho \colon V \times G \to V$ an [[action]] of $G$ on $V$  , the **quotient stack** $V//G$ is the [[quotient]] of this action but formed not in $\mathcal{T}$ but under the inclusion

$$
  \mathcal{T} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

into the [[(2,1)-topos]] over the given [[site]] of definition: it is the quotient after regarding the action as an [[infinity-action]] in $\mathbf{H}$.

This is the geometric version of the notion of _[[action groupoid]]_ .

## Properties

### Relation to principal and associated bundles

For $V = *$ the [[terminal object]], one writes $\mathbf{B}G \coloneqq *//G$.  This is the [[moduli stack]] for $G$-[[principal bundles]]. It is also the trivial _$G$-[[gerbe]]_.

There is a canonical projection $\overline{\rho} \;\colon\; V//G \to \mathbf{B}G$. This is the [[universal associated infinity-bundle|universal rho-associated bundle]].
