## Idea

For [[∞-actions]] of [[finite groups]] $G$ on objects $E$ in [[stable (∞,1)-categories]], then the [[homotopy cofiber]] $X^{t G}$ of the [[norm map]] is called the _[[Tate construction]]_, sitting in a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  X_G \stackrel{norm}{\longrightarrow} X^G \longrightarrow X^{t G}
  \,.
$$


(e.g [Lurie, def. 6.1.6.24](#Lurie))

For the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] this is accordingly called the _Tate spectrum_.

## Examples

* Tate spectra for [[cyclic groups]] play a role in the characterization of [[cyclotomic spectra]].
