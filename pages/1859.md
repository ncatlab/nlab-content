[[!redirects Gray-Groupoid]]

A **Gray-Groupoid** is a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semistrict]] [[3-groupoid]]. 

It is a [[Gray-category]] -- a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semistrict]] [[3-category]] -- in which every morphism is invertible.

Gray-groupoids are related to [[2-crossed complex]]es and [[2-crossed module]]s as strict [[3-groupoid]]s are related to [[crossed complex]]es.
