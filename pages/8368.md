__George Pólya__ (December 13, 1888 – September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician (natively: Pólya György) who worked in many fields of mathematics, including [[combinatorics]], analysis, probability and [[arithmetic]]. He was the author of a number of books on the heuristics of mathematical research, that is, methods to formulate and solve problems. Against the trend of considering mathematical reasoning to be wholly deductive, Pólya wrote on analogical and [[inductive reasoning]] in mathematics. He was also writing about mathematics education.
