George Pólya (December 13, 1888 – September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in many fields of mathematics, including combinatorics, analysis and geometry. He was the author of a number of books on the heuristics of mathematical research, that is, methods to formulate and solve problems. Against the trend of considering mathematical reasoning to be wholly deductive, Pólya wrote on analogical and [[inductive reasoning]] in mathematics.
