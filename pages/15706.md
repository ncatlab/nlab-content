**Arithmetic topology** is a theory describing some surprising analogies between 3-dimensional topology and number theory, where knots embedded in a 3-manifold behave like prime ideals in a ring of algebraic integers. 

Under this analogy, the 3-sphere, $S^3$ corresponds to $\mathbb{Q}$, or rather $spec(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ (i.e., $spec(\mathbb{Z})$), since the 3-sphere has no non-trivial (unbranched) covers while $\mathbb{Q}$ has no non-trivial unramified extensions. The [[linking number]] between two embedded knots in the 3-sphere then corresponds to the [[Legendre symbol]] between two primes in the ordinary integers.

The so-called 'MKR dictionary' (Mazur-Kapranov-Reznikov) relates terms from each side of the analogy (see sec 2.2 of [Sikora](#Sikora)).
