## Idea

**Arithmetic topology** is a theory describing some surprising [[analogies]] between [[low-dimensional topology|3-dimensional topology]] and [[number theory]], where [[knots]] embedded in a 3-manifold behave like [[prime ideals]] in a [[ring of algebraic integers]]. 

Under this analogy, the [[3-sphere]], $S^3$ corresponds to the ring of [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$, or rather $spec(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ (i.e., $spec(\mathbb{Z})$), since the 3-sphere has no non-trivial ([[branched cover|unbranched]]) covers while $\mathbb{Q}$ has no non-trivial [[unramified extensions]]. The [[linking number]] between two embedded knots in the 3-sphere then corresponds to the [[Legendre symbol]] between two primes in the ordinary integers.

The so-called _MKR dictionary_ (Mazur-Kapranov-Reznikov) relates terms from each side of the analogy (see sec 2.2 of [Sikora](#Sikora)).
