## Idea

A model structure $M_1$ is a right Bousfield
localization of a model structure $M_2$ on the same
category if $M_1$ and $M_2$ have the same fibrations
and the weak equivalences of $M_1$ contain those
of $M_2$

The notion of right Bousfield delocalization
reverses this relation: $M_1$ is a right
Bousfield delocalization of $M_2$
if $M_2$ is a right Bousfield localization of $M_1$.

Of course, the nontrivial task here
is to establish interesting existence criteria
for right Bousfield delocalizations.

## Existence theorem

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem (Corrigan-Salter)
If $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two [[cofibrantly generated]]
model structures on the same category
with coinciding classes of fibrations,
then there is a third cofibrantly generated
model structure $M_3$
with the same fibrations and whose weak equivalences
are the intersection of weak equivalences in $M_1$
and $M_2$.
This model structure is a right Bousfield delocalization
of both $M_1$ and $M_2$.
