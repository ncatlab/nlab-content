## Idea

The [[moduli stack]] of [[elliptic curves]].

For the moment see _[[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology - elliptic curves]]_ for more.

An [[elliptic curve]] $E \to Spec \mathbb{C}$ is determined, up to non-canonical [[isomorphism]], by its [[j-invariant]]

$$
  j(E) \in \mathbb{C}
  \,.
$$

Here every [[complex number]] appears as a value, and therefore the moduli space of elliptic cuves a priori is not [[compact topological space|compact]].

A [[compactification]] of the moduli space is obtained by including also elliptic curves with [[nodal singularity]].

## Description over the complex numbers

### Upper half plane

The [[upper half plane]] $\mathfrak{h}$ is in [[bijection]] with framed [[lattices]] in the [[complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}$, which in turn is in bijection with [[isomorphism]] classes of framed elliptic curves over $\mathbb{C}$

$$
  \mathfrak{h}
  \simeq
  \{framed\;lattices\;in\;\mathbb{C}\}
  \simeq
  \{framed\;elliptic\;curves\;over\;\mathbb{C}\}/_\sim
$$

and we have

$$
  \{elliptic\;curves\;over\;\mathbb{C}\}_\sim
  \simeq
  \mathfrak{h}/{SL_2(\mathbb{Z})}
$$

where the [[special linear group]] over the [[integers]] 

$$
  SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) = \left\{ \left(\array{a & b \\ c & d }\right)| a d - c d = 1\right\}$$ 

[[action|acts]]  by

$$
  \tau \mapsto \frac{a \tau + b}{c \tau + d}
  \,.
$$

### The naive moduli space and its problems

###### Definition

Write 

$$
  M_{1,1} := \mathfrak{h}/SL_2(\mathbb{Z})
$$

for the plain [[quotient]] of the [[upper half plane]] by the above group action.

###### Definition

A **homolorphic family of [[elliptic curves]]** over a [[complex manifold]] $T$ is 

* a [[holomorphic function]] $\pi : X \to T$ 

* together with a [[section]] $s : T \to X$ of $\pi$ such that for any $t \in T$ the pair $(X_t, s(t))$ is an [[elliptic curve]] (using the first definition above).

=--

For every family 

$$
  \array{
    X \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}} \\ T 
  }
$$

we would like to have $F \to M_{1,1}$ such that there is a [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X \simeq \phi^* F &\longrightarrow& F
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow
    \\
    T &\stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& M_{1,1}
  }
$$

where

$$
  \phi:   t \mapsto [X_t, s(t)]
$$

such that

* $\phi : T \to M_{1,1}$ is a [[holomorphic map]]

* every [[holomorphic map]] $T \to M_{1,1}$ corresponds to a family over $t$;

* there is a universal family over $M_{1,1}$

This is _impossible_ . One can construct explicit counterexamples. These counterexamples involve [[elliptic curves]] with nontrivial [[automorphism]]s. 

For instance

$$
  \{
    (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{P}^2 \times X : 
    y^2 = x(x-1)(x-\lambda)
  \}
  \to
  X := \mathbb{P}^1 - \{0,1,\infty\}
$$


> but see the discussion at [[moduli space]] for a discussion of the statement "it's te automorphisms that prevent the [[moduli space]] from existing"

### Moduli space of framed elliptic curves

consider

$$
  \mathbb{Z}^2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C} \times \mathfrak{h}
$$

given by

$$
  (m,n) : 
  (z,\tau)
  \mapsto
  (z + m \tau + n, \tau)
$$

Then consider the family

$$
  \array{
     E := \mathbb{C}/_{\mathbb{Z}^2} \times \mathfrak{h}
    \\ \downarrow \\ \mathfrak{h}
  }
$$

is a family of [[elliptic curve]]s over $\mathfrak{h}$

and $E_\tau = \mathbb{C}/{\Lambda_\tau}$ with

$$
  \Lambda_{\tau} := \mathbb{Z}\cdot 1 \oplus \mathbb{Z}\cdot \tau
$$

is a family of framed elliptic curves.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The space $\mathfrak{h}$ with the family $E \to \mathfrak{h}$ is a [[fine moduli space]] for [[framed elliptic curves]].

=--

Consider any map $\phi : T \to \mathfrak{h}$

with pullback of the universal family

$$
  \array{
     X \stackrel{?}{\to} \phi^* E &\to & E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&
    \mathfrak{h} 
  }
$$

**claim** for every point $t \in T$ there is an open neighbourhood $t_0 \in U \hookrightarrow T$ such that one can choose [[differential form|1-forms]] $\omega_t$ on $X_\tau$ which vary holomorphically with respect to $t$.

Notice that _locally_ every family of elliptic curves is framed (since we can locally extend a choice of basis for $H_1$).  So 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathfrak{h}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{SL_2(\mathbb{Z})}
    \\
    M_{1,1} &\stackrel{Id}{\to}&
    M_{1,1}
  }
$$

at $i$ and $\rho = e^{2\pi i/6}$ , $C = \{\pm I\}$

isn't locally liftable at $i$ and $\rho$ so it is not a univresal family of unframed curves.

### Moduli stack/orbifold of elliptic curves

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Consider the global [[quotent stack]] [[orbifold]]

$$
  \mathcal{M}_{1,1} := \mathfrak{h}//SL_2(\mathbb{Z})
$$

of the upper half plane by the [[action]] of the [[special linear group]]
over the [[integers]].

=--

This is the [[moduli stack]] of elliptic curves.

### Compactified moduli stack

Consider the complex analytic parameteritation over the [[annulus]]

$$
  \{q \in \mathbb{C} | 0 \lt {\vert q \vert} \lt 1 \}
$$

of elliptic curves

$$
  E_q \coloneqq \mathbb{C}/q^{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

This has an extension to the origin, where $E_0$ is a nodal curve. Algebraically, in a [[formal neighbourhood]] of the origin, hence over $Spec \mathbb{Z}[ [q] ]$, this is the [[Tate curve]].

e.g. ([Lurie, section 4.3](#Lurie)).

## Properties

### Cohomology

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$$
  H_1(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}, \mathbb{Z})
  = \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}
$$

$$
  H^1(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}, \mathbb{Z}) = 0
$$

$$
  H^2(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}, \mathbb{Z})
  = \mathbb{Z}/12 \mathbb{Z}
$$

$$
  H_\bullet(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}, \mathbb{Q})
  \simeq
  H_\bullet(M_{1,1}, \mathbb{Q})
$$

and similarly for [[integral cohomology]]

$$
  \chi(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}) = -\frac{1}{12}
$$

$$
  Pic(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}
$$
