Zorn\'s lemma is a standard trick for constructing (or at least, proving the existence of) objects that are 'maximal' in an appropriate sense.  It is commonly used in [[algebra]] and named after the algebraist Max Zorn.

Zorn\'s lemma and the principle of [[excluded middle]] together imply the [[axiom of choice]].  Although it doesn\'t imply excluded middle itself, Zorn\'s lemma is not generally accepted in [[constructive mathematics]].  (Say something about how one can systematically get around this in many situations ....)

## Statement and proofs

Given a [[preorder]]ed set $(S, \leq)$, an element $x$ of $S$ is _maximal_ if $y \leq x$ whenever $x \leq y$.  A _chain_ in $S$ is a subset $A$ of $S$ such that $\leq$ is a [[total order]] on $A$.  An _upper bound_ of a subset $A$ of $S$ is an element $x$ of $S$ such that $y \leq x$ whenever $y \in A$.  In these terms, we have:

###### Theorem (Zorn\'s lemma)

A preordered set $S$ has a maximal element if every chain has an upper bound.

###### Proof

The proof may be arranged in the following steps:
* For each subset of $A \subseteq S$ which is [[well-order]]ed under the preorder it inherits from $S$, choose a _strict_ upper bound $f(A) \in S$ if it has one. (Note that we use the axiom of choice here. We also freely use its consequence, excluded middle, below.)
* Say a well-ordered subset $A$ is $f$-*inductive* if for all $x \in A$, $x = f(\{y \in A: y \lt x\})$. Thus $A_0 = \emptyset$ is inductive, as is $A_1 = \{f(A_0)\}$, $A_2 = A_1 \cup \{f(A_1)\}$, $A_3 = A_2 \cup \{f(A_2)\}$ and so on. Intuitively, using the chain hypothesis, one can (by transfinite induction) define $A_\alpha$ for [[ordinal number|ordinals]] $\alpha$ by appending strict upper bounds in this way, until at some point $\alpha$, one has run out of further strict upper bounds to choose from. But by hypothesis, $A_\alpha$ does have an upper bound $x$. This element is necessarily maximal. 
* More precisely, $f$-inductive sets are well-ordered by inclusion. For if $A$ and $B$ are distinct (well-ordered and) $f$-inductive sets, then there is a smallest element contained in one but not the other, say $x \in A$ but $\neg(x \in B)$. But then $\{y \in A: y \lt x\}$ is a down-closed subset of $B$, i.e., is an initial segment of $B$. If it were a _proper_ subset of $B$, then for the least $z \in B$ in its complement we would have 
  $$ \{y \in A: y \lt x\} = \{y' \in B: y' \lt z\} ,$$ 
  whence by applying $f$ to both sides, we infer $x = z$ by $f$-inductivity of $A$ and $B$, contradiction. In that case, $B = \{y \in A: y \lt x\}$. In other words, one of $A, B$ must be an initial segment of the other. 
* Therefore the union of all $f$-inductive sets is also $f$-inductive. Being the maximal $f$-inductive set $M$, it contains any of its upper bounds (in fact there is only one up to isomorphism), and this element is necessarily maximal in $S$.

Note that the [[empty set]] is not an exception to Zorn\'s lemma; the chain $\emptyset$ does not have an upper bound.

###### Proof of converse

In fact, we first show that Zorn's lemma implies the classical [[well-ordering principle]]. The axiom of choice easily follows from the well-ordering principle. 
* Let $A$ be a set, and consider the poset whose elements are pairs $(X, R)$, where $X \subseteq A$ and $R$ is a (classical) [[well-order]]ing on $X$, ordered by $(X, R) \leq (Y, S)$ if $X$ as a well-ordered set is an initial segment of $Y$. The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma is easily established: given a chain $(X_t, R_t)_{t \in T}$, put $X = \bigcup_t X_t$ and define the relation $R$ on $X$ by $x R y$ if $x R_t y$ for any (hence all) $X_t$ containing both $x, y$. Then $R$ is a well-ordering: if $U \subseteq X$ is any nonempty set, then $U \cap X_t$ is nonempty for some $t$, and the minimal element of $U$ with respect to $R$ will also be the minimal element of $U \cap X_t$ with respect to $R_t$ (crucially using here the initial segment condition). 
* By Zorn's lemma, the poset above contains a maximal element $(X, R)$, where $X \subseteq A$. We claim $X = A$; suppose not (here we need [[excluded middle]]), and let $x$ be a member of the complement $\neg X$. Well-order $X \cup \{x\}$, extending $R$ by deeming $x$ to be the final element. This shows $(X, R)$ was not maximal, contradiction. Hence any set $A$ may be well-ordered. 
* The axiom of choice follows: suppose given a surjection $p: E \to B$, so that every fiber $p^{-1}(b)$ is inhabited. Consider any well-ordering of $E$, and define $s: B \to E$ by letting $s(b)$ be the least element in $p^{-1}(b)$ with respect to the well-ordering. This gives a section $s$ of $p$.

## Usage

It is very common, when starting with a preordered set $S$, to apply Zorn\'s lemma not to $S$ itself but to an [[up-set]] (an [[under category]]) in $S$.  That is, one starts with an element $x$ of $S$ and proves the existence of a maximal element comparable to $x$.

Zorn\'s lemma may be used to prove all of the following:

* The [[Hausdorff maximal principle]]: Every chain in $S$ is contained in a maximal chain.
* The [[ultrafilter theorem]]: Every proper [[filter]] on a set may be extended to an [[ultrafilter]].
* The [[maximal ideal theorem]]: Every [[ideal]] in a [[ring]] may be extended to a [[maximal ideal]].
* The [[basis theorem]]: Every [[vector space]] (over a [[field]]) has a basis.
* etc ...

Some of these are equivalent to Zorn\'s lemma, while some are weaker; conversely, some additionally require excluded middle.
