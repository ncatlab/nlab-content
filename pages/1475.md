# Zorn\'s Lemma

## Idea

_Zorn\'s lemma_ is a [[proposition]] in [[set theory]] and [[order theory]]. It says that: _A [[preorder]] in which every sub-[[total order]] has an [[upper bound]] has a [[maximal element]]._ 

Depending on the chosen perspective on [[foundations]]
this is either an [[axiom]] or a [[deduction|consequence]] of the [[axiom of choice]]; or neither if neither the axiom of choice nor Zorn's lemma is assumed as an axiom.
Conversely, Zorn\'s lemma and the [[axiom of excluded middle]] together imply the [[axiom of choice]].  Although it doesn\'t imply excluded middle itself, Zorn\'s lemma is not generally accepted in [[constructive mathematics]] as an [[axiom]].  

> (Say something about how one can systematically get around this in many situations ....)


In as far as it holds or is assumed to hold, Zorn's lemma is a standard method for constructing (or at least, [[proof|proving]] the [[existence]] of) objects that are 'maximal' in an appropriate sense.  It is commonly used in [[algebra]] and named after the algebraist [[Max Zorn]].



## Statement and proofs

###### Definition

* Given a [[preorder|preordered]] set $(S, \leq)$, an element $x$ of $S$ is _[[maximal element|maximal]]_ if $y \leq x$ whenever $x \leq y$.  

* A _[[chain]]_ in $S$ is a [[subset]] $A \hookrightarrow S$ such that $\leq$ is a [[total order]] on $A$.  

* An _[[upper bound]]_ of a subset $A$ of $S$ is an element $x$ of $S$ such that $y \leq x$ whenever $y \in A$.

###### Definition

The [[proposition]] __Zorn\'s Lemma__ states that each preordered set $S$ has a maximal element if every chain in $S$ has an upper bound.

+-- {: .num_theorem #TheLemma}
###### Theorem

Suppose the [[axiom of choice]] holds. Then Zorn\'s Lemma holds.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
By contradiction. (A direct proof of the existence of a maximal element is not possible, so we freely use the [[axiom of excluded middle]], which in any case follows from AC, the axiom of choice. The one use made of AC is noted below.) 

Suppose $S$ has no maximal element. Then every chain $C \subseteq S$ has a *strict* upper bound: an element $x$ such that $c \lt x$ for all $c \in C$. (Take an upper bound $y$ of $C$, then $y$ is not maximal by supposition, so any $x$ with $y \lt x$ will serve.) For each $W \subseteq S$ that is well-ordered by $\leq$, use AC to choose a strict upper bound $f(W)$ of $W$. Given a such a function $f: Well(S) \to S$ from well-ordered subsets of $S$ to $S$, let us say $W \in Well(S)$ is *$f$-inductive* if for every $x \in W$, we have $x = f(\{y \in W: y \lt x\})$. 

Let $Y, Z \in Well(S)$ be $f$-inductive sets; we will show one is an initial segment of the other. Let $I$ be the maximal initial segment common to both ($I$ may be empty), and suppose for a contradiction that $I$ is properly contained in both; let $y$ be the least element of $Y \setminus I$, and $z$ the least element of $Z \setminus I$. Then $\{x \in Y: x \lt y\} = I = \{x' \in Z: x' \lt z\}$, so by $f$-inductivity of $Y, Z$, we have $y = f(I) = z$. Thus $I$ extends to initial segments $I \cup \{y\} = I \cup \{z\}$, contradicting maximality of $I$. Hence $I = Y$ or $I = Z$, making one of $Y, Z$ an initial segment of the other.  

So the collection of $f$-inductive sets is totally ordered by inclusion of initial segments, making their union $U$ the maximal $f$-inductive set. Appending its strict upper bound $f(U)$, the chain $U \cup \{f(U)\}$ is a larger $f$-inductive set, contradiction. The proof is complete.

###### Remark

The [[empty set]] is not an exception to Zorn\'s lemma, as the chain $\emptyset$ does not have an upper bound.

###### Remark 
The proof above (does anyone know where it appears in the literature?) can be seen as an application of general recursion theory &agrave; la Paul Taylor's [[Practical Foundations of Mathematics|book]], which in turn follows Osius. In particular, initial segments are the same as $P$-coalgebra maps between [[well-founded coalgebras]], and the maximal $U$ constructed is a maximal attempt with respect to a partial algebra structure $f: P(S) \rightharpoonup S$, following Taylor's formulation of the recursion scheme. For a slightly different arrangement of the facts, one very commonly found in the literature, see the account of the Bourbaki-Witt theorem below.

###### Theorem 

If Zorn\'s Lemma and the [[principle of excluded middle]] hold, then so do the [[well-ordering principle]] and the [[axiom of choice]].
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We first show that Zorn's lemma implies the classical [[well-ordering principle]]. The [[axiom of choice]] easily follows from the well-ordering principle. 

1. Let $A$ be a set, and consider the [[poset]] whose elements are pairs $(X, R)$, where $X \subseteq A$ and $R$ is a (classical) [[well-order]]ing on $X$, ordered by $(X, R) \leq (Y, S)$ if $X$ as a well-ordered set is an initial segment of $Y$. The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma is easily established: given a chain $(X_t, R_t)_{t \in T}$, put $X = \bigcup_t X_t$ and define the relation $R$ on $X$ by $x R y$ if $x R_t y$ for any (hence all) $X_t$ containing both $x, y$. Then $R$ is a well-ordering: if $U \subseteq X$ is any nonempty set, then $U \cap X_t$ is nonempty for some $t$, and the minimal element of $U$ with respect to $R$ will also be the minimal element of $U \cap X_t$ with respect to $R_t$ (crucially using here the initial segment condition). 

2. By Zorn's lemma, the poset above contains a maximal element $(X, R)$, where $X \subseteq A$. We claim $X = A$; suppose not (here is where we need [[excluded middle]]), and let $x$ be a member of the complement $\neg X$. Well-order $X \cup \{x\}$, extending $R$ by deeming $x$ to be the final element. This shows $(X, R)$ was not maximal, contradiction. Hence any set $A$ may be well-ordered. 

3. The [[axiom of choice]] follows: suppose given a [[surjection]] $p: E \to B$, so that every [[fiber]] $p^{-1}(b)$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]]. Consider any well-ordering of $E$, and define $s: B \to E$ by letting $s(b)$ be the least element in $p^{-1}(b)$ with respect to the well-ordering. This gives a section $s$ of $p$.

## Usage

It is very common, when starting with a preordered set $S$, to apply Zorn\'s lemma not to $S$ itself but to an [[up-set]] (an [[under category]]) in $S$.  That is, one starts with an element $x$ of $S$ and proves the existence of a maximal element comparable to $x$.

Zorn\'s lemma may be used to prove all of the following:

* The [[Hausdorff maximal principle]]: Every chain in $S$ is contained in a maximal chain.
* The [[ultrafilter theorem]]: Every proper [[filter]] on a set may be extended to an [[ultrafilter]].
* The [[maximal ideal theorem]]: Every [[ideal]] in a [[ring]] may be extended to a [[maximal ideal]].
* The [[basis theorem]]: Every [[vector space]] (over a [[field]]) has a basis.
* etc ...

Some of these are equivalent to Zorn\'s lemma, while some are weaker; conversely, some additionally require excluded middle.
