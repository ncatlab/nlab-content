## Idea

An [[algebraic variety]] $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{A}^n$ defined as the [[zero locus]] of [[polynomials]] $\{f^i \in R[x_1, \cdots, x_n]\}$ is _singular_ at a point $p$, if the [[Jacobian matrix]] of first [[derivatives]] at this point has [[rank]] lower than at other points.

A variety is called _singular_ if it has at least one singular point and _non-singular_ if it has none.

## Examples

* [[cusp]]

* [[nodal curve]]

## Related concepts

* [[geometric point]]
