##Definition##
Given a scheme $S$. A $S$-stack $X$ (i.e a category fibered in groupoids over $(Aff/S)_{et}$ satisfying descent) is Deligne-Mumford when it has a representable, separable and quasi-compact diagonal $\Delta: X\rightarrow X\times_S X$ and a covering $P:A\rightarrow X$ which is surjective, representable and etale, by an algebraic space $A$.
 

Deligne-Mumford stacks correspond to moduli problems in which the objects being parametrized have finite automorphism groups.
