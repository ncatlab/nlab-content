on [[internal categories in homotopy type theory]] and their [[Rezk completion]] to [[univalent categories]].

> **Abstract.**  We develop [[category theory]] within [[Univalent Foundations]], which is a [[mathematical foundation|foundational system for mathematics]] based on a [[homotopy type theory|homotopical interpretation]] of [[dependent type theory]]. In this system, we propose a definition of "[[category]]" for which [[equality]] and [[equivalence of categories]] agree. Such categories satisfy a version of the [[univalence axiom|Univalence Axiom]], saying that the [[type]] of [[isomorphisms]] between any two [[objects]] is [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalent]] to the [[identity type]] between these objects; we call them "saturated" or [[univalent categories|"univalent" categories]]. Moreover, we show that any category is [[weak equivalence|weakly equivalent]] to a univalent one in a [[universal construction|universal]] [[Rezk completion|way]]. In [[relation between category theory and type theory|homotopical and higher-categorical semantics]], this construction corresponds to a truncated version of the [[Rezk completion]] for [[Segal spaces]], and also to the [[stackification|stack completion]] of a [[prestack]].
