A polynomial $P$ over a field $K$ is separable if all its irreducible factors have distinct roots over the algebraic closure $\bar{K}$ of $K$. 

An extension $K\subset L$ of [[fields]] is __separable__ if every element $x\in L$ is a root of a separable polynomial over $K$. 

Every finite separable field extensions is an [[Ã©tale morphism]] of rings.
