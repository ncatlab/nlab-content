A [[polynomial]] $P$ over a [[field]] $K$ is __separable__ if all its irreducible factors have distinct roots over the [[algebraic closure]] $\bar{K}$ of $K$. 

An [[field extension|extension]] $K\subset L$ of fields is __separable__ if every element $x\in L$ is a root of a separable polynomial over $K$. 

Every finite separable field extension is an [[Ã©tale morphism]] of rings.

If $K\subset L\subset M$ are fields and $K\subset M$ is separable, then $L\subset M$ is also separable.
