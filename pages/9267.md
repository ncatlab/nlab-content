## Idea

In [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[quantum field theory]] an [[observable]] that evaluates the [[time-ordered products]] of the point-evaluation obserables of the basic [[field (physics)|fields]] at $n$ points of [[spacetime]] in some [[state on a star-algebra]] is called an _$n$-point function_, typically denoted

$$
  \left\langle
    :
    \mathbf{\Phi}(x_1) 
    \mathbf{\Phi}(x_2) 
    \cdots
    \mathbf{\Phi}(x_n)
    :
  \right\rangle
$$

For details on what this means see at _[[geometry of physics -- perturbative quantum field theory]]_ chapter _[7. Observables](geometry+of+physics+--+perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Observables)_ and chapter [15. Interacting quantum fields](geometry+of+physics+--+perturbative+quantum+field+theory#QuantumObservables)

Specifically the 2-point functions are also known as _[[Feynman propagators]]_, see Section _[9. Propagators](geometry+of+physics+--+perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Propagators)_.

In [[Euclidean field theory]] (say under [[Wick rotation]]) $n$-point functions are also called _[[correlators]]_, but in fact both terms are often used interchangeably.

Traditionally $n$-point functions are thought of as [[distributions]] [[distribution of several variables|of several variables]]. In [[relativistic field theory]] these have [[singularities]] on the "relative [[light cones]]", hence whenever two points $x_i$ are [[lightlike]]. 

On the other hand, in [[Euclidean field theories]] the $n$-point functions/correlators are distributions with singularities only on the [[fat diagonal]], hence when at least two of their arguments coincide. This means that in [[Euclidean field theory]] $n$-point functions/correlators [[restriction of distributions|restrict]] to smooth (non-singular) [[differential forms]] on [[configuration spaces of points]]. For more on this perspective see at _[[correlators as differential forms on configuration spaces of points]]_.
