## Idea and terminology

A **direction** on a set $S$ is a [[preorder]] on $S$ in which any finite subset has an [[upper bound]].  A **directed set** is a [[set]] equipped with a direction.  A **directed poset** is a directed set whose preorder is a [[partial order]] (so _directed proset_ might be a better term than _directed set_). Note that many authors by directed set mean directed poset.

Directedness is an asymmetric condition.  Sometimes a direction as defined here is called **upward-directed**; a preorder whose [[opposite category|opposite]] is upward-directed is called **downward-directed** or **codirected**.

A [[subset]] of a poset (or proset) which is a directed set (when regarded as a poset in its own right) is a **directed subset**, and dually.  More generally, a [[diagram]] in a [[category]] whose domain is a directed set (when regarded as a [[thin category]]) is called a **directed diagram**, and dually.


## Definitions

### Finitely directed set 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **finitely upward-directed set** (which is the default notion) is a [[set]] with a [[preorder]] $\leq$ such that:

1. there exists an element (so the set is [[inhabited set|inhabited]]); and

2. given elements $x, y$, there exists an element $z$ such that $x \leq z$ and $y \leq z$.

=--

It follows that, given any [[finite set]] $x_1, \dots, x_n$ of elements, there exists an element $z$ such that $x_i \leq z$ for all $i$. 

(For [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] purposes, one should interpret 'finite set' above as a [[finite set|finitely indexed set]], as shown.)

Equivalently, this says:

###### Definition

A directed set is a [[proset]] which is a [[filtered category]]: a **filtered [[(0,1)-category]].

In analogy with the definition there, we can provide an [[biased definition|unbiased definition]] that is also commonly used in the literature:

###### Definition

A directed set is a [[proset]] in which every finite subset has an upper bound.

### Higher cardinality

More generally, if $\kappa$ is a [[cardinal number]], then a **$\kappa$-directed set** is equipped with a preorder $\leq$ such that, given any index set $A$ with $|A| \lt \kappa$ and function $i \mapsto x_i$ from $A$, there exists an element $z$ such that $x_i \leq z$ for all $i$. Then a finitely directed set is the same as an $\aleph_0$-directed set.  An **infinitely directed set** allows any index set $A$ whatsoever, but this reduces to the statement that the proset has a [[top]] element.


## Remarks

Directions on the [[real line]] are quite interesting; there\'s a textbook (probably _LIMITS: A New Approach to Real Analysis_) that does [[infinitesimal calculus|ordinary calculus]] rigorously from scratch using directions, and there\'s a paper (which I can\'t find now) generalising interval arithmetic to arithmetic on directions.

As a partially ordered set is a special kind of [[category]], so a (finitely) directed set is such a category in which all (finite) diagrams admit a [[cocone]].  If the category actually has finite coproducts (equivalently, all finite colimits), then it has all [[joins]] and so is a join-[[semilattice]].  (In particular, every join-semilattice is a directed set.)

Directed sets are heavily used in point-set [[topology]] and [[analysis]], where they serve as index sets for [[nets]] (aka Moore--Smith sequences).  In this application, it is important that a direction need not be a partial order, since a net need not preserve the preorder in any way but by default still preserves [[equality]].  (But in principle, one could force a directed set to be a poset by allowing a net to be a [[multi-valued function]]; this has practical consequences for the meaning of [[sequence]] in the absence of [[countable choice]].)

[[join|Joins]] over directed index sets are [[directed joins]]; [[colimits]] over directed index sets are [[directed colimits]].  These play an important role in the theory of [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] and [[accessible category|accessible]] categories; see also [[filtered category]].
