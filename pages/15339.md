##Idea
The _Craig interpolation theorem_ is a basic result in the [[model theory]] of [[first-order logic]].

First proved by W. Craig for classical predicate calculus in 1957, it has been extended to [[intutionistic logic]] by K. Schütte in 1962.
Andrew M. Pitts and [[Michael Makkai]] have proved variants in categorical logic e.g. for [[pretoposes]]. Diaconescu proved an abstract variant in _instution-independent model theory_ (cf. Augier-Barbier(2007), Diaconescu(2008)).

**Craig interpolation theorem.** Let $\varphi ,\psi$ be two sentences of classical first-order logic $\mathcal{L}_{\omega\omega}$ such that $\varphi\models\psi$. Then there is a sentence $\theta$, the _interpolant_, such that $\varphi\models\theta$ and $\theta\models\psi$ where the symbols occurring in $\theta$ are contained in the intersection of the symbols occurring in $\varphi$ and $\psi$.

An immediate corollary is the [[Beth definability theorem]].

The theorem plays an important role in [[abstract model theory]] where the question whether the Craig interpolation property can take over the role of the [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]] in [[Lindström's theorems]] has been called 'one of the main open problems of the field' by Väänänen (2008, p.404).

In [[Analytic Philosophy]], the theorem has played a key role in a classical  argument by Carl C. Hempel (1958) against a clear division between observable and auxiliary concepts in scientific theories as originally envisioned by the Viennese circle.
