## Idea

An embedding is, generally, a [[morphism]] which in some sense is an [[isomorphism]] onto its [[image]]

For this to make sense in a given [[category]] $C$, we not only need a good notion of image.  Note that it is not enough to have the image of $f\colon X \to Y$ as a [[subobject]] $\im f$ of $Y$; we also need to be able to interpret $f$ as a morphism from $X$ to $\im f$, because it is this morphism that we are asking to be an isomorphism.


* [[effective epimorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular epimorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[covering]]

* [[effective monomorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular monomorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[embedding]] .


## As regular or effective monomorphisms

### Definition

One general abstract way to define an _embedding_ morphism is to say that this is equivalently a [[regular monomorphism]].

If the ambient category has finite [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, then this is equivalently an [[effective monomorphism]]. In terms of this we recover a formalization of the above idea, that an embedding is an iso onto its _image_ :

For a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in $C$ the definition of [image as an equalizer](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/image#AsEqualizer) says that the [[image]] of $f$ is

$$
  im f := \lim_\leftarrow ( Y \stackrel{\to}{\to} Y \coprod_X Y) 
  \,.
$$ 

In particular we have a factorization of $f$ as

$$
  f : X \stackrel{\tilde f}{\to} im f \hookrightarrow Y
  \,,
$$

where the morphism on the right is a [[monomorphism]].

The morphism $f$ being an [[effective monomorphism]] means that $\tilde f$ is an [[isomorphism]], hence that $f$ is an "isomomorphism onto its image".

## Examples

### In $Top$

A morphism $U \to X$ of [[topological space]]s is a regular monomorphism precisely if this is an injection such that the topology on $U$ is the [[induced topology]]. This is an **embedding of topological spaces**.
