An embedding is, generally, a [[morphism]] which is an [[isomorphism]] onto its [[image]].

For this to make sense in a given [[category]], we not only need a good notion of image.  Note that it is not enough to have the image of $f\colon X \to Y$ as a [[subobject]] $\im f$ of $Y$; we also need to be able to interpret $f$ as a morphism from $X$ to $\im f$, because it is this morphism that we asking to be an isomorphism.
