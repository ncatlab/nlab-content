## Idea

A _Diophantine equation_ is a [[polynomial]] [[equation]] over the [[integers]], hence an equation of the form

$$
  P(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n) = 0
$$

where $P(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n) \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \cdots, x_m]$ is a [[polynomial]] in $n$ [[variables]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]], and where solutions are considered for these variables taking values in the integers.

These are equations of central interest in [[number theory]].

Spaces of solutions of Diophantine equations may be thought of as [[varieties]] in [[arithmetic geometry]].
