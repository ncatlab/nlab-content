## Idea

An _adjoint action_ is an [[action]] by _conjugation_ .

## Definition

### Of a group on itself

The _adjoint action_ of a [[group]] $G$ on itself is the [[action]] $Ad : G \times G \to G$ given by

$$
  Ad : (g,h) \mapsto g^{-1} \cdot h \cdot g
  \,.
$$

### Of a Lie group on its Lie algebra

The adjoint action $ad : G \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}$ of a [[Lie group]] $G$ on its [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is for each $g \in G$ the [[derivative]] $d Ad(g) : T_e G \to T_e G$ of this action in the second argument at the neutral element of $G$

$$
  ad : (g,x) \mapsto Ad(g)_*(x)
  \,.
$$

This is often written as $ad(g)(x) = g^{-1} x g$ even though for a general Lie group the expression on the right is not the product of three factors in any way.  But for a [[matrix Lie group]] $G$ it is: in this case both $g$ as well as $x$ are canonically identified with [[matrices]] and the expression on the right is the product of these matrices.

### Of a Hopf algebra on itself

Let $k$ be a commutative unital ring and $H = (H,m,\eta,\Delta,\epsilon, S)$ be a [[Hopf algebra|Hopf]] $k$-algebra with multiplication $m$, unit map $\eta$, comultiplication $\Delta$, counit $\epsilon$ and the antipode map $S: H\to H^{op}$. We can use [[Sweedler notation]] $\Delta(h) = \sum h_{(1)}\otimes_k h_{(2)}$. The adjoint action of $H$ on $H$ is given by

$$
h\triangleright g = \sum h_{(1)} g S(h_{(2)})
$$

and it makes $H$ not only an $H$-module, but in fact a monoid in the monoidal category of $H$-modules (usually called $H$-[[module algebra]]).
