## Idea

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]] the underlying [[dual vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^*$ canonically inherits the structure of a [[Poisson manifold]] whose Poisson [[Lie bracket]] reduces on linear functions $\mathfrak{g} \hookrightarrow C^\infty(\mathfrak{g}^*)$ to the original Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{g}$. This is the **Lie-Poisson structure** on $\mathfrak{g}^*$.

More generally, for $\mathfrak{a}$ a [[Lie algebroid]] the fiberwise dual $\mathfrak{a}^*$ inherits such a Poisson manifold structure.

## Definition

### Abstractly

First notice that for $f \in C^\infty(\mathfrak{g}^\ast)$ as smooth function on the dual of a Lie algebra, then its [[de Rham differential]] 1-form at some $\alpha \in \mathfrak{g}^\ast$, being a linear map

$$
  \mathbf{d} f|_{\alpha}
  \colon
  T_\alpha \mathfrak{g}^\ast
  =
  \mathfrak{g}^\ast
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}
$$

is canonically identified with a Lie algebra element itself.

With this understood, then for $f,g \in C^\infty(\mathfrak{g}^*)$ two [[smooth functions]] on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ their Poisson [[Lie bracket]] in the Lie-Poisson structure is defined by

$$
  \{f,g\} \;\colon\; \theta \mapsto -\theta ([\mathbf{d} f, \mathbf{d} g])
  \,.
$$

Notice that for $v\in \mathfrak{g}$ regarded as a linear function $\langle -,v\rangle$ on $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$, then under the above identification we have $\mathbf{d} \langle -,v\rangle = v$. This means that on linear functions the Lie-Poisson bracket is simply the original Lie bracket:

$$
  \left\{
    \langle -, v_1\rangle,
    \langle -, v_2\rangle,
  \right\}
  = 
  \langle - ,[v_1,v_2]\rangle
  \,.
$$

This Lie-Poisson structure may be thought of as the unique smooth extension of this bracket on linear functions to all smooth functions on $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$.

## Properties

### Symplectic groupoid

The [[symplectic groupoid]] [[Lie integration|integrating]] the Lie-Poisson structure on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the [[action groupoid]] $\mathfrak{g}^* //G$ of the [[coadjoint action]]. For more see at _[[symplectic groupoid]]_ in the section _[Examples -- Of Lie-Poisson stucture](symplectic+groupoid#OfLiePoissonStructure)_.

### Symplectic leaves

The [[symplectic leaves]] of the Lie-Poisson structure on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ are the [[coadjoint orbits]].
