## Idea

The _Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems_ characterize [[spacetimes]] in the theory of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) which have "singularities", points where the [[Riemann curvature]] is undefined (or would be undefined if these points were included in the spacetime [[manifold]]) such as appears notably in [[black hole spacetimes]].

[Hellman](#Hellman) suggest this theorem as an example of non[[computable physics]]. See [Frank](#Frank) for a response.

A related problem is that of the [maximal Cauchy development for the Einstein equations](#Sbierski). In this case, at least [[Zorn's lemma]] can be avoided.
