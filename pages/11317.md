## Idea

The _Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems_ characterize [[spacetimes]] in the theory of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) which have "singularities", points where the [[Riemann curvature]] is undefined (or would be undefined if these points were included in the spacetime [[manifold]]) such as appears notably in [[black hole spacetimes]].
