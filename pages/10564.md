### 2-Equivariant elliptic cohomology

> under construction, tentative

In ([Lurie, section 5.1](#Lurie)) is a vague mentioning of a more general perspective, where one evaluates elliptic cohomology not just on [[action groupoids]] of a [[group]], such as $B G$ but also on [[homotopy quotients]] of [[2-groups]], such as notably the [[string 2-group]], and how that gives a more conceptual picture. 

The following are some remarks on how to possibly realize this and at the same time refine it to geometric cohomology ([[differential cohomology]]). Tentative. Handle with care.


So let $G$ be a simple, simply connected [[compact Lie group]].

Regard $\mathbf{B}G$ in [[Smooth∞Grpd]] = $Sh_\infty(SmthMfd)$. Then by the discussion at [[Lie group cohomology]] we have

$$
  \pi_0\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}\mathbb{C}^\times)
  \simeq
  H(B G, K(\mathbb{Z},4))
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The [[∞-group extension]] classified by $k \in \mathbb{Z} \in \pi_0\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}\mathbb{C}^\times)$ is the [[string 2-group]] at level $k$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{C}^\times &\longrightarrow& \mathbf{B}String_k(G)
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{k\mathbf{c}}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{C}^\times
  }
$$ 

This cocycle has a [[differential cohomology]]-refinement to the [[universal Chern-Simons 3-connection]]

$$
  k \mathbf{L} \;\colon\; \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{C}^\times_{conn}
$$

Now given a [[torus]] $E = T^2$, regarded, for the moment, as a [[smooth manifold]], we have the [[transgression]] of the definition cocycle

$$
  \exp\left(
    \tfrac{i}{\hbar}
    \int_{E} k \mathbf{L}
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  [E, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]
   \stackrel{[E, k \mathbf{c}]}{\longrightarrow}
  [E, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}]
   \stackrel{\exp\left(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} \int_{E}(-)\right)}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{B}\mathbb{C}^\times_{conn}
$$ 

which now defines a $\mathbb{C}^\times$ [[bundle with connection]] on the [[moduli stack of connections]] on $E$.  We can restrict to the [[moduli stack of flat connections]], the [[phase space]] of $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]]. This is the [[Hitchin connection]].

Consider then a collection of tori $E$ parameterized trivially over some parameter space $B$. 

$$
  E \times B \to B
  \,.
$$

Then the above yields

$$
  [(\Pi E) \times B, \mathbf{B}G]
   \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{B}[B,\mathbb{C}]^\times
$$

hence yields a $[B,\mathbb{C}^\times]$-bundle over the [[moduli space]] of $B$-collections of flat connections on $E$.

Now we want to consider this for the case that $B$ is a space in [[spectral geometry]].

To that end, pass to the larger [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[smooth E-∞ groupoids]] over the [[complex numbers]].

Let $\mathbb{G}_m$ there denote the object which to a pair consisting of a [[smooth manifold]] $U$ and an [[E-∞ ring]] $R$ assigns

$$
  \mathbb{G}_m \;\colon\; (U, R) \mapsto GL_1(R) \otimes C^\infty(U,\mathbb{C}^\times) 
$$ 

hence the [[tensor product]] of the [[∞-group of units]] of $R$ with the underlying [[abelian group]] of [[smooth functions]] on $X$ with values in $\mathbb{C}^\times$. 

Let then $A \in CAlg_\infty$ be an [[E-∞ ring]], and take now $B = Spec(A)$. Write 

$$
  E \to Spec(A)
$$

for a $B$-collection of [[tori]], now taken to be an [[elliptic curve]] over $Spec(A)$.

Since for a [[torus]] its [[fundamental group]] is [[isomorphic]] to its [[character group]] (via the canonical non-degenrarate [[bilinear form]] on both), we take the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi(E)$ now to be

$$
  \mathbf{B}[E, \mathbb{G}_m]
  \,.
$$

Then since $\mathbb{C}^\times = \mathbb{G}_m$ is the [[multiplicative group]] in this context, we have now (and there is a subtlety here...) that maps 

$$
  Spec(A) \longrightarrow \mathbb{G}_m
$$

are equivalently elements in the [[∞-group of units]] of $A$. So we should get an $A$-[[(∞,1)-module bundle]] modulated by

$$
  \chi
   \colon
  [ \mathbf{B}[E,\mathbb{G}_m], \mathbf{B}G ]
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{B}GL_1(A)
  \,.
$$

Forming its space of co-sections yields, by the discussion at [[Thom spectrum]], the $\chi$-[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] A-[[cohomology]] [[spectrum]]

$$
  A^\chi([ \mathbf{B}[E,\mathbb{G}_m], \mathbf{B}G ])
  \,.
$$

And that should be the $G$-"equivariant" elliptic cohomology of the point. Actually the [[motivic quantization]] of $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]].

(...)






## Properties
 {#Properties}

### Relation to conformal blocks of the WZW model
 {#RelationToConformalBlocks}


For $G$ a compact, simple and simply connected Lie group,
consider the [[string 2-group]] [[∞-group extension]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) &\to& \mathbf{B}String
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[higher moduli stacks]] of [[flat ∞-connections]] on an [[elliptic curve]] $T$ form the [[∞-group extension]]

$$
  \array{
    [\Pi(T),\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)] &\to& [\Pi(T),\mathbf{B}String]
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && [\Pi(T), \mathbf{B}G]
  }
  \,.
$$

Now passing to the [[0-truncation]] turns the bottom piece into the [[moduli space of flat connections]] on the torus, which is $A_G$, def. \ref{TheModuliSpace}, remark \ref{ModuliSpaceOfFlatConnections}.

By the discussion at [smooth higher holonomy](smooth+infinity-groupoid#StrucChernSimons) the 0-truncation of the top left piece is $U(1)$, so under 0-truncation we should get a $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    U(1) &\longrightarrow& \tau_0 [\Pi(T),\mathbf{B}String]
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && A_G
  }
  \,.
$$

This state of affairs is hinted at in ([Lurie, section 5.1](#Lurie)).

More in detail, notice that the [[string 2-group]] extension is modulated by a map

$$
  \mathbf{c} \;\colon\; \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
$$

and the above circle-bundle is modulated by the [[transgression]] of that 

$$
  \exp\left(
    \tfrac{i}{\hbar}
    \int_{T} \mathbf{c}
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  [T, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]
   \stackrel{[T,\mathbf{c}]}{\longrightarrow}
  [T, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}]
   \stackrel{\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} (-) )}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

(By the discussion at [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct]].)

By the general discussion at [[quantization of Chern-Simons theory]] and the [[holography|holograpic]] [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|CS-WZW correspondence]], the space of [[sections]] of this line bundle is the space of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]] on $T$. 

(This statement also appears as ([Lurie, remark 5.2](#Lurie))). 


### Relation to loop group representations
 {#RelationToLoopGroupRepresentations}

When restricting the above general construction
to the [[Tate curve]], then the confromal blocks become
[[loop group representations]].

In terms of differential geometry [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct]] consider the map

$$
  G \longrightarrow [S^1, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]
$$

which locally sends a group elemnent $g$ to the constant [[principal connection]] on the circle with $g$ as its [[holonomy]].

This induces an inclusion

$$
  [S^1, G]
    \hookrightarrow
  [S^1, [S^1, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]]
    \simeq
  [T, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]
$$ 

and pulling the above WZW circle bundle back along this inclusion
yields the bundle on the [[loop group]] which is the [[prequantum bundle]]
whose [[geometric quantization]] yields the [[loop group representations]]
of [[positive energy representations|positive energy]].

Algebraically, this corresponds to evaluating equivariant elliptic cohomology on the [[Tate curve]], this is ([Lurie, theorem 5.1](#Lurie)).

###### Remark

In the full [[derived algebraic geometry]] the space of sections of the line
bundle on the moduli space has the structure of a $K((q))$-[[∞-module]], hence of an actual [[spectrum]] ([Lurie, below remark 5.4](#Lurie)).
