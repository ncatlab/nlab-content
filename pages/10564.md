### Relation to loop group representations

That equivariant elliptic cohomology is related to [[representations]] of [[loop groups]] as [[equivariant K-theory]] is related to the [[representation theory]] of the underlying groups had long been conjectured. The idea appears in

cohomology_, volume 342 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note
Ser., pages 114–121. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 2007

Relation to the [[Witten genus]] [[partition function]] of [[superstrings]] is discussed in
