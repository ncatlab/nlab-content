### Relation to loop group representations

That equivariant elliptic cohomology is related to [[representations]] of [[loop groups]] as [[equivariant K-theory]] is related to the [[representation theory]] of the underlying groups had long been conjectured. The idea appears in

* I. Grojnowski, _Delocalised equivariant elliptic cohomology_, in _Elliptic
cohomology_, volume 342 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note
Ser., pages 114–121. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 2007

elliptic cohomology_ . Geom. Topol., 7:91–153,

* [[Matthew Ando]], _Power operations in elliptic cohomology and representations of loop groups_ Transactions of the American
Mathematical Society 352, 2000, pp. 5619-5666.

and was then further refined in section 5.2 of ([Lurie](#Lurie)) and in ([Gepner 05](#Gepner05)).

Relation to the [[Witten genus]] [[partition function]] of [[superstrings]] is discussed in
