## Definitions

A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on an [[abstract set]] $A$ is __left euclidean__ if every two elements both related to a third are also related to each other:
$$ x, y, z: A,\; x \sim z,\; y \sim z \;\vdash\; x \sim y .$$
A relation $\sim$ is __right euclidean__ if this works in the other order:
$$ x, y, z: A,\; x \sim y,\; x \sim z \;\vdash\; y \sim z .$$
One could also say __euclidean__ and __co-euclidean__ or __op-euclidean__, or similarly.


## Relationship to equivalence relations

An [[equivalence relation]] is a relation that is both [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and euclidean in either direction (in which case it\'s euclidean in both directions).  Defining equivalence relations this way (rather than using transitivity and symmetry) is analogous to defining a [[group]] using (one-sided) division instead of multiplication and inverse; both are special cases of an analogous definition of [[groupoid]].  One can also define an equivalence relation as a relation that is both [[entire relation|entire]] and left euclidean (or the reverse); this is analogous to defining a group using division and furthermore merely stating that some element exists rather than that there is an identity element.  (Perhaps more familiarly, one can define a [[subgroup]] of a given group as a subset that is closed under division and has at least one element.)


## History

The above (reflexive and euclidean) is the earliest definition of equivalence, dating back (at least) to [[Euclid]]\'s Common Notion 1 (hence the name).  In Heath\'s translation,
>Things \[geometric figures\] which are equal to \[have the same magnitude as\] the same thing are also equal to one another.
It is not clear, however, if Euclid appreciated the distinction between this and transitivity; he may have taken it for granted that equality of magnitude is symmetric, which destroys the distinction.  (One can similarly argue whether Common Notion 4 expresses reflexivity or whether it merely means that [[congruence]] entails [[equality]] of magnitude, with the equivalence-relation nature of congruence again going unstated.  See [this discussion](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/cn.html).)
