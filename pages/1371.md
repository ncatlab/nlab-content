## Idea

As a model for an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] a [[simplicially enriched category]] may be thought of as a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictification]] of a [[quasi-category]]: composition along 0-cells is strictly associative and unital.

The [[quasi-category]] corresponding to a simplicial category $C$ is its
[[homotopy coherent nerve]] $N$

$$
  sSet Cat \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{N}{\to}} sSet
  \,.
$$
