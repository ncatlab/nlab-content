One of the greatest recent achievements in algebraic topology is the construction of a [[spectrum]] called **tmf**, for  "topological modular forms". 

It is the global [[section]] of a certain [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]] of [[higher algebra|commutative ring]] [[spectrum|spectra]] over
the moduli [[stack]] of elliptic curves. 

From this sheaf, one can recover the Adams-type spectral sequence associated to tmf. According to [[Jacob Lurie]], this
sheaf is actually the [[structured generalized space|structure sheaf]] of the moduli stack classifying
"oriented elliptic curves" over commutative ring spectra, or, to be in the correct variance, over [[derived stack|derived affine schemes]].
