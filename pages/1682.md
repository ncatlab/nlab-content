The [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory called **tmf** is the one represented by the [[spectrum]] that is obtained as the [[homotopy limit]] of the spectra of all [[elliptic cohomology]] theories.

The abbreviation "tmf" stands for the [[ring]] of [[topological modular form]]s as this is the [[cohomology ring]] that $tmf$ assigns, essentially, to the [[point]].

One of the greatest recent achievements in [[algebraic topology]] is the construction of the tmf [[spectrum]] as the global [[section]] of a certain [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]] of [[higher algebra|commutative ring]] [[spectrum|spectra]] over the moduli [[stack]] of elliptic curves. 

From this sheaf, one can recover the Adams-type spectral sequence associated to tmf. According to [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|SEC]], this sheaf is actually the [[structured generalized space|structure sheaf]] of the moduli stack classifying
"oriented elliptic curves" over commutative ring spectra, or, to be in the correct variance, over [[derived stack|derived affine schemes]].
