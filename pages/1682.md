## Idea

The [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory called __$\mathop{tmf}$__ is the one represented by the [[spectrum]] that is obtained as the [[homotopy limit]] of the spectra of all [[elliptic cohomology]] theories.

The abbreviation "$\mathop{tmf}$" stands for the [[ring]] of [[topological modular forms]] as this is the [[cohomology ring]] that $\mathop{tmf}$ assigns, essentially, to the [[point]].

One of the greatest recent achievements in [[algebraic topology]] is the construction of the $\mathop{tmf}$ [[spectrum]] as the global [[section]] of a certain [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]] of [[higher algebra|commutative ring]] [[spectrum|spectra]] over the moduli [[stack]] of elliptic curves. 

From this sheaf, one can recover the Adams-type spectral sequence associated to $\mathop{tmf}$. According to [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology|SEC]], this sheaf is actually the [[structured generalized space|structure sheaf]] of the moduli stack classifying "oriented elliptic curves" over commutative ring spectra, or, to be in the correct variance, over [[derived stack|derived affine schemes]]. 


## Witten genus

The $tmf$-[[spectrum]] is the codomain of the [[Witten genus]]

$$ 
  Bord_{(\infty,\infty)}^{String} \to tmf
  \,.
$$
