#Idea#


A _principal 2-bundle_ is a [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of a [[principal bundle]]. It is closely related to and in fact a generalization (in the case of a single group rather than a sheaf of groups) of the concept [[gerbe]] (although that concept could easily be further generalised to match). See [[gerbe (general idea)]] for more background.


#Definition#

Recall first the situation for ordinary [[principal bundle]]s:

As essentially originally due to an an old observation by Segal, recalled in the context of interest here in

* [[Urs Schreiber]], [[David Roberts]], _The inner automorphism 3-group of a strict 2-group_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1741))

for $G$ a [[group]] and $\mathbf{B} G$ the corresponding one-object [[groupoid]], a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ is a bundle of "spaces" (in whatever context of [[space and quantity|generalized space]] one works) that arises as the [[homotopy limit|homotopy pullback]] of the point (see [[generalized universal bundle]]) along a morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}G $ in the right higher category of groupoids (for instance given by an [[anafunctor]])

$$
 \array{
  P &\to& {*}
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  X &\to& \mathbf{B} G
 }
  \,.
$$

This is a very general construction that is to be interpreted and makes sense with all objects here appearing as generalized spaces called [[infinity-stack]]s, in practice in particular [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] using the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. The general idea used here is described at [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] and at [[gerbe (general idea)]]. 

This general description of higher bundles internal to generalized spaces modeled as [[infinity-stack]]s is discussed in

* Jardine, _Cocycle categories_ ([pdf](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0605198)) .


The above situation of ordinary $G$-[[principal bundle]]s is section 2.1 _[[torsor|Torsor]]s for [[sheaf|sheaves]] of groups_ in that article. The generalization to principal 2-bundles and [[principal infinity-bundle]]s is then briefly indicated in section 2.2, _Diagrams and torsors_ .

The point is that in the [[(infinity,1)-topos]] of topological or smooth or whatever [[infinity-groupoid]]s (i.e. in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[infinity-stack]]s on our category of [[space and quantity|test spaces]]) the above situation generalizes straightforwardly:

For $H$ a [[2-group]], an $H$-principal $2$-bundle is a fibration of groupoids $P \to X$ that arises as the [[fibration sequence|homotopy fiber]] of a classifying morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}H$ (a $2$-[[2-anafunctor|anafunctor]])

$$
 \array{
  P &\to& {*}
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  X &\to& \mathbf{B} G_{(2)}
 }
  \,.
$$

As ordinary [[principal bundle]]s, these gadgets may be described from various points of view, using [[anafunctor]] cocycles $g : X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}\leftarrow Y \to \mathbf{B}H$ in [[nonabelian cohomology]], or the corresponding total spaces being 2-[[torsor]]s equipped with 2-group [[action]], or certain variants of this. 

Maybe the earliest explicit description of a principal $\infty$-bundle using a [[geometric definition of higher category]] is

* P. Glenn, _Realization of cohomology classes in arbitrary exact categories_, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 25, 1982, no. 1, 33- 105.

This describes [[torsor]]s over [[infinity-groupoid]]s in terms of the corresponding $\infty$-[[action groupoid]]s.

The first article aiming to make this theory of higher bundles and [[gerbe]]s more manifestly look concretely like a systematic [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of the familiar description of ordinary [[principal bundle]]s in terms of cocycles and local trivializations is

* [[Toby Bartels]], _2-Bundles_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0410328), [web](http://toby.bartels.name/2bundles/))

One should notice that if one uses categories internal to [[diffeological space]]s, then these are (under their [[nerve]]) in particular [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]], and that the [[anafunctor]]s used as morphisms between these simplicial presheaves represent precisely the morphisms the corresponding [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] using the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] or, more lightweight, the structure of a Brown [[category of fibrant objects]] on $\infty$-groupoid valued sheaves.

The relation of such 2-categorical constructions of 2-bundles to the one of simplicially modeled $\infty$-bundles by Glenn was established in

* Igor Bakovi&cacute;, _Bigroupoid 2-torsors_ ([pdf](http://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9209/1/Bakovic_Igor.pdf)).

Still more explicit descriptions of these constructions are given in 

* Christoph Wockel, _A global perspective to gerbes and their gauge stacks_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3692)) .

# Connections #

An ordinary [[principal bundle]] may be equipped with a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] by refining the cocycle

$$
  X \to \mathbf{B} G
$$

to a cocycle

$$
  P_1(X) \to \mathbf{B} G
$$

where $P_1(X)$ is the [[path groupoid]] of $X$.

Similarly, 2-bundles may be equipped with connections by refining their cocycles $X \to \mathbf{B}H$ to cocycles out of a higher path groupoid. Details in this are at [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|Differential Nonabelian Cohomology]].
