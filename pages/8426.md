## Idea

In 1928, [[J. W. Alexander]] published a paper "Topological Invariants of Knots and Links" in which he defined a polynomial [[knot invariant|invariant]] of [[knots]] and developed new insights including the braid relations.  There are several ways to look at these invariants, some of these use the [[knot group]] previously defined by [[Max Dehn]], but there are also various combinatorial methods derived from Alexander's original one. One of the best known methods is via [[Fox derivatives]] and is described in the classical text by [[Richard Crowell]] and [[Ralph Fox]].

(...)

For a fiber surface $T$, the translation of the fibre around the base-space circle determines an element in the mapping-class group of $T$, a homeomorphism $h\colon T \to T$ well defined up to isotopy; this element is called the _holonomy_ of the fiber surface; the _Alexander polynomial_ is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the map the holonomy  induces on $H_1(T)$.

> (that is similar to how the [[Artin L-function]] is defined... see also  [Sikora 01, analogy 2.2 (10)](#Sikora01))

In [[arithmetic topology]], Alexander-Fox theory is the analog of [[Iwasawa theory]] ([Morishita, section 7](#Morishita)).
