## Definition

A [[1-morphism]] in a [[2-category]] is an _[[equivalence]]_ if there exists another 1-morphism the other way around, such that both are [[inverses]] up to invertible [[2-morphisms]].

## Examples

* An equivalence in a [[1-category]] regarded as a [[2-category]] with only trivial [[2-morphisms]] is just an [[isomorphism]].

* An equivalence in the 2-category [[Cat]] of all [[categories]] is an [[equivalence of categories]].
