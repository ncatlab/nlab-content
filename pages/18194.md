## Definition

A [[1-morphism]] in a [[2-category]] is an _[[equivalence]]_ if there exists another 1-morphism the other way around, such that both are [[inverses]] up to invertible [[2-morphisms]]. 1-equivalence is a synonym to an equivalence in a 2-category.

## Examples

* An equivalence in a [[1-category]] regarded as a [[2-category]] with only trivial [[2-morphisms]] is just an _[[isomorphism]]_.

* An equivalence in the 2-category [[Cat]] of all [[categories]] is an _[[equivalence of categories]]_.

* An equivalence in the 2-category of [[algebras]] with [[bimodules]] as 1-morphisms and [[intertwiners]] as 2-morphisms (see [here](bimodule#AsMorphismsInA2Category)) is a _[[Morita equivalence]]_.
