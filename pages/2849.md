## Idea

Like a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a smooth [[manifold]] equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]], a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a [[manifold]] equipped with a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]].  [[Lorentzian manifolds]], as well as Riemannian manifolds themselves, are special cases of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
