## Definition

An **initial object** in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[object]] $\emptyset$ such that for any object $x$ of $C$, there is a unique [[morphism]] $!:\emptyset\to x$.  An initial object, if it exists, is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]], so we speak of [[the]] initial object.

An initial object may also be called _coterminal_, _universal initial_, _co-universal_, or simply _universal_.

Initial objects are the [[duality|dual]] concept to [[terminal object]]s: an initial object in $C$ is the same as a terminal object in $C^{op}$.  An object that is both initial and terminal is called a [[zero object]].


Hence the initial object may also be viewed as the [[colimit]] over the [[empty diagram]].

## Examples

* An initial object in a [[partial order|poset]] is a [[bottom element]].

* The [[empty set]] is an initial object in [[Set]].

* Likewise, the [[empty category]] is an initial object in [[Cat]], the [[empty space]] is an initial object in [[Top]], and so on.

* The [[trivial group]] is the initial object (in fact, the zero object) of [[Grp]] and [[Ab]].

* The [[integers]] comprise the initial object of [[Ring]].


## Strict initial objects
   {#Strict}

An initial object $\emptyset$ is called a **[[strict initial object]]** if any morphism $x\to \emptyset$ must be an [[isomorphism]].  The initial objects of a poset, of $Set$, $Cat$, $Top$, and of any [[topos]] (in fact, any [[extensive category]]) are strict.  At the other extreme, a [[zero object]] is only a strict initial object if the category is trivial (equivalent to the [[terminal category]]).

## Cones over the identity
 {#ConesOverTheIdentity}

By definition, an initial object is equipped with a universal [[cocone]] under the unique functor $\emptyset\to C$ from the [[empty category]].  On the other hand, the unique morphisms $!:\emptyset \to x$ form a cone *over* the [[identity functor]], i.e. a natural transformation $\Delta_\emptyset \to Id_C$ from the [[constant functor]] at the initial object to the identity functor.  In fact this is almost another characterization of an initial object:

###### Theorem
Suppose $I\in C$ is an object equipped with a natural transformation $p:\Delta_I \to Id_C$ such that $p_I = 1_I : I\to I$.  Then $I$ is an initial object of $C$.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Obviously $I$ has at least one morphism to every other object $X\in C$, namely $p_X$, so it suffices to show that any $f:I\to X$ must be equal to $p_X$.  But the naturality of $p$ implies that $\Id_C(f) \circ p_I = p_X \circ \Delta_I(f)$, and since $p_I = 1_I$ this is to say $f \circ 1_I = p_X \circ 1_I$, i.e. $f=p_I$ as desired.

###### Corollary 
An object $I$ is initial in $C$ iff $I$ is the limit of $Id_C$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $I$ is initial, then there is a [[cone]] $(!_X: I \to X)_{X \in Ob(C)}$ from $I$ to $Id_C$, and if $(p_X: A \to X)_{X \in Ob(C)}$ is any cone from $A$ to $Id_C$, then $p_X = !_X \circ p_I$. Hence $p_I: A \to I$ defines a morphism of cones, and the unique morphism of cones since if $q$ any morphism of cones, then $p_I = !_I \circ q = 1_I \circ q = q$. Thus $(!_X: I \to X)_{X \in Ob(C)}$ is the limit cone. 

Conversely, if $(p_X: L \to X)_{X \in Ob(C)}$ is a limit cone for $Id_C$, then $p_X \circ p_L = p_X$ for all $X$. This means that both $p_L: L \to L$ and $1_L: L \to L$ define morphisms of cones; since the limit cone is the terminal cone, we infer $p_L = 1_L$. Then by Theorem \ref{cone} we conclude $L$ is initial.

This corollary is actually a key of entry into the [[adjoint functor theorem|general adjoint functor theorem]]. Showing that a functor $G: C \to D$ has a [[left adjoint]] is tantamount to showing that each functor $D(d, G-)$ is [[representable functor|representable]], i.e., that the [[comma category]] $d \downarrow G$ has an initial object $(c, \theta: d \to G c)$. This is the limit of the identity functor, but typically this is the limit over a large diagram whose existence is not guaranteed. The point of a solution set condition is to replace this with a small diagram which is cofinal in the large diagram.
