## Definition ##

An **initial object** in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[object]] $\emptyset$ such that for any object $x$ of $C$, there is a unique [[morphism]] $!:\emptyset\to C$.  

The initial object, if it exists, is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]]. An initial object is sometimes called a universal initial object or simply a universal object. 

Initial objects are the [[duality|dual]] concept to [[terminal object]]s: an initial object in $C$ is the same as a terminal object in $C^{op}$.


If the initial objects is also a [[terminal object|terminal]], it is called a [[zero object]].


## Examples ##

* The empty set is an initial object in [[Set]].

* An initial object in a [[partial order|poset]] is a [[bottom]] element.


* Likewise, the empty category is an initial object in [[Cat]], the empty space is an initial object in [[Top]], and so on.

* The trivial group is the initial object (in fact, the zero object) of [[Grp]] and [[Ab]].

* The integers are the initial object of [[Ring]].

## Strict initial objects

An initial object $\emptyset$ is called **strict** if any morphism $x\to \emptyset$ must be an [[isomorphism]].  The initial objects of a poset, of $Set$, $Cat$, $Top$, and of any [[topos]] (in fact, any [[extensive category]]) are strict.  At the other extreme, a [[zero object]] is only a strict initial object if the category is trivial (equivalent to the [[terminal category]]).
