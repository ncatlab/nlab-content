## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] $f : Y \to X$ in an [[(∞,1)-category]] is an **effective epimorphism** if it has a [[Cech nerve]], of which it is the [[(∞,1)-colimit]]; in other words the augmented simplicial diagram

$$
  \cdots
  Y \times_X Y \times_X Y 
  \stackrel{\tl}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
Y \times Y \times_X Y \stackrel{\to}{\to}  Y \stackrel{f}{\to} X
$$

is a colimiting diagram.

This appears below [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 6.2.3.5]] for $C$ a [[(∞,1)-semitopos]], but seems to be a good definition more generally.


## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ an [[(∞,1)-semitopos]]  we have that $f : X \to Y$ is an effective epimorphism precisely if its (-1)-[[truncated|truncation]] is a [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]] in the [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C/X$.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 6.2.3.5]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

In an [[(∞,1)-semitopos]], effective epimorphisms are stable under [[(∞,1)-pullback]].

This appears as ([Lurie, prop. 6.2.3.15](#Lurie)).



## Examples

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

In $C = $ [[∞Grpd]] a morphism $f : Y \to X$ is an effective epimorphism precisely if it induces an [[epimorphism]] $\pi_0 f : \pi_0 Y \to \pi_0 X$ in [[Set]] on connected components.
 
=--

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 7.2.1.15]].  More generally, the effective epimorphisms in any [[(∞,1)-topos]] are precisely the [[n-connected object of an (infinity,1)-topos|(-1)-connected morphisms]], and therefore form a [[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category|factorization system]] together with the [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category|monomorphisms]] (the (-1)-truncated morphisms).
