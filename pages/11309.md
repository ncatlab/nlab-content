* {#Nikolaus14} [[Thomas Nikolaus]], _T-Duality in K-theory and Elliptic Cohomology_, talk at _String Geometry Network Meeting_, Feb 2014, ESI Vienna ([website](http://www.ingvet.kau.se/juerfuch/conf/esi14/esi14_34.html))

The talk announced three results which are foundational for the topic of [[topological T-duality]].

## 1. T-duality equivalences in universal elliptic cohomology ($tmf$)

A famous result of the 1990s is that [[D-brane charges]], hence the information associated with the [[boundary conditions]] of [[open string|open]] [[superstrings]], are [[cocycles]] in [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[differential K-theory|K-theory]]. Since two [[target spaces]] related under [[T-duality]] are supposed to induce equivalent [[superstring]] [[sigma-models]], they should in particular have the same [[K-theory]]. This is indeed the case, a fact proven in full generality in [[topological T-duality]] (see there for references).

But [[T-duality]] is supposed to induce an equivalence not just of these booundary data, but for the full [[string theory]]. By the seminal results on the [[Witten genus]] it is known that the [[partition function]] of the [[superstring]] is an [[elliptic genus]], and by the seminal results on the [[string orientation of tmf]] it is known that this is just a shadow of an [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in [[tmf]]-[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory (the "universal [[elliptic cohomology]]"). Ever since it is natural to expect that full string theories are actually classified not just in [[K-theory]] but in [[elliptic cohomology]] hence in [[tmf]].

> A properly developed theory of [[elliptic cohomology]] is likely to shed some light on what [[string theory]] really means. ([Witten 87, very last sentence](string+theory#EllipticGenera)).

Now ([Nikolaus 14](#Nikolaus14)) claims, under certain conditions, that indeed [[topological T-duality]] induces equivalences in [[tmf]] cohomology classes. The conditions are actually fairly mild, one sufficient condition is that the rank of the [[torus]] bundle is $\leq 6$. (This is already the most interesting case in applications in [[physics]].)
