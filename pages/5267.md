For a [[linear operator]] $A$ on a finite-dimensional complex vector space $X$, the spectrum of $A$ is simply the subset of the field of complex numbers consisting of eigenvalues of $A$. The set of eigenvalues is however not the best invariant in the $\infty$-dimensional case: it looks like generalized eigenvectors not belonging to $X$ (say in the sense of [[Gelfand triple]]) should be considered. 

In the case when $X$ is a complex [[separable Hilbert space]] this theory is best established. Then the spectrum is the set of all $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{C}$ in which the [[resolvent]] $(A-\lambda I)^{-1}$ is not defined as a bounded operator. In other words, the spectrum is the complement of the subset of complex numbers for which the resolvent is a bounded operator.

If $A$ is a [[bounded linear operator]] on a complex separable Hilbert space, then the spectrum $\sigma(A)$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$. The set $\sigma_d(A)$ of ordinary eigenvalues of $A$ is a subset of $\sigma(A)$ called the discrete spectrum of $A$. In particular case when $A$ is a [[compact operator]] the spectrum consists of the discrete spectrum only, except for possible addition of point $0$.
