## Idea

A $B$-parameterized family of [[Dirac operator]]s on $d$-dimensional space gives rise to their [[determinant line bundle]] on $B$. If $d = 8k+2$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ this has a canonical square root line bundle, the **Pfaffian line bundle**.

## As quantum anomaly 

In the [[path integral]] [[quantization]] of [[quantum field theory]], the partial [[path integral]] of an [[action functional]] over just the [[fermionic field]]s yields in general not a function on the remaining space of bosonic fields, but a section of a [[line bundle]] on this bosonic configuration space, the [[determinant line bundle]] of the family of [[Dirac operator]]s. The [[Lorentzian metric]] assumed in relativistic quantum field theory leads in the Wick-rotated theory to the passage to the square root of this line bundle.

Therefore the nontriviality of the Pfaffian line bundle is in these dimensions the fermionic [[quantum anomaly]].
