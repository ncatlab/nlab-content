## Idea

The conjectured _geometric Langlands correspondence_ asserts that for $G$ a  [[reductive group]] there is an equivalence of [[derived categories]] of [[D-module]]s on the [[moduli stack]] of $G$-[[principal bundle]]s over a given curve, and [[quasi-coherent sheaves]] on the moduli space of ${}^L G$-[[local system]]s 

$$
  \mathcal{D} Mod( Bun_G)
  \simeq
  \mathcal{O}Mod(Loc_{{}^L G})
$$

for ${}^L G$ the [[Langlands dual group]].

This equivalence is a certain limit of the more general [[quantum geometric Langlands correspondence]] that identifies twisted $D$-modules on both sides.
