I am a postdoc at the [University of California, San Diego](http://www.math.ucsd.edu).  Here is my [web page](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mshulman/).  I am interested in (higher) category theory and its applications to the rest of mathematics, particularly homotopy theory.  I also tend to be a partisan of higher-categorical structures other than $n$-categories (such as [[double categories]], [[multicategories]], [[proarrow equipments]], and so on), which sometimes seem to get neglected.

For my own reference: some pages that I'm planning to do some work on:
* [[theory]]
* [[lax 2-adjunction]]
* [[structured (infinity,1)-topos]] and [[classifying topos]]
* [[generalized multicategory]], [[virtual double category]], [[virtual equipment]]
* functoriality of [[codiscrete cofibrations]],
* create a separate page [[two-sided fibration]], also work on [[fibration in a 2-category]]
* categories over computads at [[monadicity theorem]].
* copy some stuff over from my personal web

And here's how to make a barred arrow $A &#x21F8; B$, since I always forget:

      &#x21F8;
