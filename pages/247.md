I am an Assistant Professor at the [University of San Diego](http://www.sandiego.edu).  Here is my [web page](http://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/).

I have recently been deeply involved in [[homotopy type theory]].  I am also interested in (higher) [[category theory]] and its applications to the rest of mathematics, particularly [[homotopy theory]].  I also tend to be a partisan of higher-categorical structures other than $n$-categories (such as [[double categories]], [[multicategories]], [[proarrow equipments]], [[F-categories]], and so on), which sometimes seem to get neglected.

For my own reference: some pages that I was once planning to do some work on:
* [[theory]]
* [[lax 2-adjunction]]
* [[structured (infinity,1)-topos]] and [[classifying topos]]
* [[generalized multicategory]], [[virtual double category]], [[virtual equipment]]
* functoriality of [[codiscrete cofibrations]],
* create a separate page [[two-sided fibration]], also work on [[fibration in a 2-category]]
* categories over computads at [[monadicity theorem]].
* copy some stuff over from my personal web
* write [[descent object]]

And here's how to make a barred arrow $A &#x21F8; B$, since I always forget:

      &#x21F8;

And here's the esh $&#643;$ (see [here](http://nforum.mathforge.org/discussion/4594/shape-modality-flat-modality-sharp-modality/?Focus=37694#Comment_37694)):
