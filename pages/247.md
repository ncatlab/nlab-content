I am a postdoc at the [University of Chicago](http://www.math.uchicago.edu).  Here is my [web page](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~shulman/).  I am interested in (higher) category theory and its applications to the rest of mathematics, particularly homotopy theory.

I often seem to have strong feelings about terminology.  But I have been known to admit to being wrong, so feel free to argue with me.

For my own reference: some pages that I'm planning to do some work on:
* [[theory]]
* [[lax 2-adjunction]]
* [[coherent formula]]
* [[structured (infinity,1)-topos]]
