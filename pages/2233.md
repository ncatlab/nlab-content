A concept in [[FQFT|FQFT (functorial quantum field theory)]] generalizing the concept of TQFT. The main thing about ETQFT's is that for a differentiable manifold $M$ an ETQFT $Z$ give a scalar diffeomorphism invariant $Z(M)$, $Z$ evaluated on $M$. It can be calculated after $M$ has been simplified such as triangulated. Then $Z(M)$ can be computed from computing $Z$ on all the simplicies and output a scalar invariant $Z(M)$ in a base ring $R$.

#The category of extended cobordisms#

$nCob_m$ has closed smooth compact oriented n-manifolds as objects and cobordisms of cobordisms up to cobordisms of dimension m, up to diffeomorphism.

A (j+1)-cobordism between j-cobordisms is...

See [[extended cobordism]].

#Definition#
For a fixed base ring $R$,
and C a symmetric monoidal n-category.

A m-extended C-valued TQFT of dimension n is a symmetric n-tensor functor $Z:nCob_m \rightarrow C$ that assign
* closed smooth compact oriented n-manifolds $\rightarrow$ elements of $R$
* closed smooth compact oriented (n-1)-manifolds $\rightarrow$ $R$-modules
* bordisms of closed smooth compact oriented (n-1)-manifolds $\rightarrow$ $R$-linear maps between $R$-modules
* closed smooth compact oriented (n-2)-manifolds $\rightarrow$ $R$-linear 1-categories
* bordisms of closed smooth compact oriented (n-2)-manifolds $\rightarrow$ functors between $R$-linear 1-categories

* ...

* closed smooth compact oriented 0-manifolds $\rightarrow$ $R$-linear (m-2)-categories
* bordisms of closed smooth compact oriented 0-manifolds $\rightarrow$ (m-2)-functors between $R$-linear (m-2)-categories

with compatibility conditions and gluing formulas that must be satisfied...

m can range between 2 and n+1.

This suggests that one can see ETQFT's as C-valued representations of $nCob_m$.

#Examples#

m=2 gives ordinary TQFT.

The most common case is when $R$=$C$ (the complex numbers) giving unitary ETQFT.

The most common cases for C is
C=$nHilb(R)$, the category of n-Hilbert spaces over a field $R$. As far as i know it is only defined up to n=2.

C=$nVect(R)$, the category of n-vector spaces over a field $R$.

C=$nMod(R)$, the (conjectured?) category of n-$R$-modules.

#Construction of ETQFT's#

* By generators and relations

* By path integrals (this is Daniel Freed's approach)

* By modular tensor n-categories?

#Classification of ETQFT#

_Rafael_: I am very tired because it is very late.
Please check and expand this page, i am not counting very good with my eyes half closed neither am i an expert on ETQFT.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: notice that I had a bit on extended QFT over at [[FQFT]]. Maybe some of the material needs to be merged. i have now at least added links back and forth.

_Rafael_: Yes, for the merge. I think of a subsection here **construction of ETQFTs** and a pointer to the relation between ETQFT to AQFT. I also think you are much better to include the construction of ETQFTs in **Nonabelian cocycles and their sigma model QFTs** than me.
