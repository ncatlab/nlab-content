## Idea

A kind of [[spectral sequence]] related to the [[Bockstein homomorphism]].

The Bockstein spectral sequence is traditionally defined by an [[exact couple]] in a way that does not manifestly come from a [[filtered chain complex]]. However there is a way to set it up such that it does appear as the [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] ([Palmieri, section 3.2](#Palmieri)).
