
In [[measure theory]], two [[functions]] $f, g\colon X \to Y$ are __almost-everywhere equal__, or __almost equal__, if their [[equaliser]]
$$ \{ a\colon X \;|\; f(a) = g(a) \} $$
is a [[full set]].  We are usually only interested when the functions $f$ and $g$ are [[measurable function|measurable]], although this is not technically necessary.  We also may consider when $f$ and $g$ are [[almost functions]] ([[partial functions]] whose domains are full).

As we need to know what a full set is, there is no notion of almost equality on an arbitrary classical [[measurable space]].  However, if the measurable space is equipped with such a notion (as is always the case with a [[Cheng measurable space]] or a [[localisable measurable space]]), then we have almost functions.  Of course, a [[measure space]] also has plenty of structure for this.  The morphisms between [[measurable locales]] are also inherently considered only up to almost equality.

Besides measure theory, the concept applies whenever we have a notion of something being true (in this case, that two functions are equal) [[almost everywhere]].
