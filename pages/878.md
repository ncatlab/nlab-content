## Definition

A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __symmetric__ if any two elements that are related in one order are also related in the other order:
$$\forall (x, y: A),\; x \sim y \;\Rightarrow\; y \sim x$$

In the language of the $2$-poset-with-duals [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __symmetric__ if it is contained in its reverse:
$$R \subseteq R^{op}$$
In that case, this containment is in fact an equality.
