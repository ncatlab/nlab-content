## Idea

In [[physics]] given two [[physical system]] their _composite_ is meant to be both systems regarded as a single system, but trivially so, without the two interacting.

In [[classical mechanics]] forming a composite in this sense amounts to taking the [[cartesian product]] of their [[phase spaces]].

In [[quantum mechanics]] forming the comosite amounts to taking the (non-cartesian) [[tensor product]] of the [[spaces of quantum states]].
