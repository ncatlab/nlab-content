#Higher categories in quantum field theory#

Even though _quantum field theory_ has been around for decades and has been very successful both as a phenomenological model in experimental physics as well as a source of deep mathematical structures and theorems, from a mathematical perspective it is still to a large extent mysterious. 

There are essentially two alternative approaches for formalizing quantum field theory and making it accessible to mathematical treatment: 

 * _algebraic quantum field theory_: [[AQFT]] 

 * _functorial quantum field theory_: [[FQFT]]. 

(Other structures which are used to define quantum field theories, such as [[vertex operator algebra]]s are now more or less understood to be special cases of these two approaches.)

Both [[AQFT]] and [[FQFT]] lead to [[higher category theory|higher categorical structures]]. In fact, a couple of important higher categorical structures were motivated from and first considered in the context of quantum field theory. For instance 

* John Roberts first conceived the idea of $\infty$-categorical [[nonabelian cohomology]] in the context of [[AQFT]].

* the notion of the "$\infty$-category of [[cobordism]]s", which is thought to play a role analogous to and as fundamental as the [[sphere spectrum]] was motivated from [[FQFT]];

* the [[generalized tangle hypothesis]] was formulated by Baez and Dolan in the context of extended topological [[FQFT]].

There are some indications that such [[higher category theory|higher categorical structures]], such as those appearing in [[groupoidification]], are essential for clarifying some of the mysteries of quantum field theory, such as the [[path integral]]. While this is far from being clarified, this is what motivates research in higher categorical structures in QFT. 

Ours is the age to figure this out.
