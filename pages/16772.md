## Idea

### Dihedral groups
 {#DihedralGroups}

The dihedral group, $D_{2n}$, is a [[finite group]] of [[order of a group|order]] $2n$. It may be defined as the [[symmetry group]] of a regular $n$-gon. 

For instance $D_6$ is the symmetry group of the equilateral triangle and is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[symmetric group]], $S_3$.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is thus the [[subgroup]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(2)$ which is generated from the finite [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $C_n$ of $SO(2)$ and the [[reflection]] at the $x$-axis (say).  It is a semi-direct product of $C_n$ and a $C_2$ corresponding to that reflection.

Under the further embedding $O(2)\hookrightarrow SO(3)$ the (cyclic and) dihedral groups are precisely those [[finite subgroups of SO(3)]] that, among their [[ADE classification]], are not in the exceptional series. 

(see e.g. [Greenless 01, section 2](#Greenless01))

###### Remark
**Warning on notation**

There are two different conventions for numbering the dihedral groups.  

1. The above is the _algebraic convention_ in which the suffix gives the [[order]] of the group: ${\vert D_{2 n}\vert} = 2 n$.

1. In the _geometric convention_ one writes "$D_n$" instead of "$D_{2n}$", recording rather the geometric nature of the object of which it is the symmetry group.  

   Also beware that there is yet another group denoted $D_n$ mentioned at _[[Coxeter group]]_.

### Binary dihedral/dicyclic groups
  {#BinaryDihedralGroup}

Under the further lift through the [[spin group]]-[[double cover]] map $SU(2) \simeq Spin(3) \to SO(3)$ of the [[special orthogonal group]], the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is covered by the _binary dihedral group_, also known as the _dicyclic group_ and denoted

$$
  2 D_{2n} = Dic_n
$$

Equivalently, this is the lift of the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ ([above](#DihedralGroups)) through the [[pin group]] [[double cover]] of the [[orthogonal group]] [[O(2)]] to [[Pin(2)]]

$$
  \array{
    2 D_{2n}
    &\overset{\phantom{AA}}{\hookrightarrow}&
    Pin_-(2)
    &\overset{\phantom{AA}}{\hookrightarrow}&
    Spin(3)
    \\
    \big\downarrow
    &{}^{(pb)}&
    \big\downarrow
    &{}^{(pb)}&
    \big\downarrow
    \\
    D_{2n}
    &\overset{\phantom{AA}}{\hookrightarrow}&
    O(2)
    &\overset{\phantom{AA}}{\hookrightarrow}&
    SO(3)    
  }
$$

Explicity, let $\mathbb{H} \simeq \mathbb{C} \oplus j \mathbb{C}$ be the [[quaternions]] realized as the [[Cayley-Dickson double]] of the [[complex numbers]], and identify the [[circle group]]

$$
  SO(2) \simeq S\big( \mathbb{C}\big) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{H}
$$

with the [[unit circle]] in $\mathbb{C} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{H}$ this way, with group structure given by multiplication of [[quaternions]]. Then the [[Pin group]] [[Pin(2)]] is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[subgroup]] of the [[group of units]] $\mathbb{H}^\times$ of the [[quaternions]] which consists of this copy of [[SO(2)]] together with the multiplies of the imaginary quaternion $j$ with this copy of $SO(2)$:

$$
  Pin_-(2)
  \;\simeq\;
  S\big( \mathbb{C}\big) 
   \;\cup\; 
  j \cdot S\big( \mathbb{C}\big) 
  \;\subset\;
  S(\mathbb{H}) 
  \;\simeq\;
  Spin(3)
  \,.
$$

The binary dihedral group $2 D_{2n}$ is the [[subgroup]] of that generated from 

1. $ a \coloneqq \exp\left( \pi i \tfrac{1}{n} \right) \in S(\mathbb{C}) \subset Pin_-(2) \subset Spin(3)$

1. $x \coloneqq j \in Pin_-(2) \subset Spin(3)$.

It is manifest that these two generators satisfy the relations

$$
  a^{2n} = 1
  \,,
  \phantom{AA}
  x^2 = a^n \; (= -1)
  \,,
  \phantom{AA}
  x^{-1} a x = a^{-1}
$$

and in fact these [[generators and relations]] fully determine $2 D_{2n}$, up to [[isomorphism]].





## Properties

### Group cohomology

The [[group cohomology]] of the dihedral group is discussed for instance at [Groupprops](#Groupprops).

### As part of the ADE pattern

[[!include ADE -- table]]

### Group presentation

The dihedral group $D_{2n}$ has a group presentation 

$$\langle x,y : x^n=y^2=(xy)^2=1\rangle.$$

From this it is easy to see that it is a [[semi-direct product]] of the $C_n$ generated by $x$ and the $C_2$ generated by $y$.  The action of $y$ on $x$ is given by $\,^y x= x^{-1}$.

It is a standard example considered in elementary [[combinatorial group theory]].


## Examples

### Quaternion group $Q_8$ and triality

</div>

The first binary dihedral group $2 D_4$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[quaternion group]] of order 8:

$$
  2 D_4 (= Dic_2) \simeq Q_8
  \,.
$$

In the [[ADE-classification]] this is the entry [[D4]].
