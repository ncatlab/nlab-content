## Idea

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq$, the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is the [[subgroup]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(2)$ which is generated from the finite [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $C_n$ of $SO(2)$ and the [[reflection]] at the $x$-axis (say).

Under the further embedding $O(2)\hookrightarrow SO(3)$ the (cyclic and) dihedral groups are precisely those [[finite groups]] in the [[ADE classification]] which are not in the exceptional series. 

## Properties

### Group cohomology

The [[group cohomology]] of the dihedral group is discussed for instance at [Groupprops](#Groupprops).

### As part of the ADE pattern
