Minor is used in two meanings

* a submatrix of a [[matrix]]

* the determinant of a square submatrix of a matrix with entries in a commutative [[ring]]

where the second meaning is a bit more standard. There is a noncommutative analogue, namely the quasiminor, which is the quasideterminant of a square submatrix of a matrix with entries in a noncommutative ring.
