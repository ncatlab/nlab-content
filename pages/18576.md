## Idea

What is called the _Dirac propagator_ is the [[Green functions]] for the [[wave operator]]/[[Klein-Gordon operator]] (hence "[[propagator]]") on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] $(X,e)$ which is the sum of the [[advanced propagator]] $\Delta_A$ and the [[retarded propagator]] $\Delta_R$


$$
  \Delta_D \coloneqq \Delta_R + \Delta_A
$$

Since $\Delta_A(x,y) = \Delta_R(y,x)$, this is symmetric in its arguments, 
reflecting the fact that this is the integral kernel for [[time-ordered products]] away from the [[diagonal]].
