## Idea

### General

The [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]] induces a smash product on [[spectra]].

This is the canonical [[tensor product]] in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra]]. There are various [[model category]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentations]] for which which are symmetric [[monoidal model categories]] (such as the [[highly structured spectra]]: [[S-modules]], [[symmetric spectra]] and [[orthogonal spectra]], but also for instance [[excisive functors]]). See at _[[symmetric monoidal category of spectra]]_ for more on this. Passing to the [[stable homotopy category]], it become a [[symmetric monoidal category]] under the smash product. Under mild assumptions, this is the essentially unique symmetric tensor product with [[unit]] the [[sphere spectrum]] ([Shipley 01](#Shipley01)).

### History

Historically the discussion proceeded in the opposite direction: available variants of the construction of smash products on [[sequential spectra]] (the "handicrafted" or "naive" smash products [Boardman 65](#Boardman65), [Adams 74, part III, section 4](#Adams74)) were found to yield a [[symmetric monoidal category]] structure _only_ after passage to the [[stable homotopy category]]. Then models via non-sequential [[highly structured spectra]] were discovered wich do admit a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] in the sense of 1-category theory, as do [[excisive functors]], see at _[[model structure on excisive functors]]_.

### As Day convolution spectra

Many versions of the smash product of spectra, [[symmetric smash product of spectra|symmetric or not]], arise as [[Day convolution]] products on a suitable [[enriched category|enriched]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]] version of a [[category]] of "index spaces".

The [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] on, in particular,  [[symmetric spectra]] and  [[orthogonal spectra]] is the Day convolution product for [[Top]]-[[enriched functors]] on monoidal categories of [[symmetric groups]] of [[orthogonal groups]], respectively ([MMSS 00, theorem 1.7 and section 21.](#MMSS00)).

Similarly the [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] on the [[model structure for excisive functors]] is Day convolution for [[sSet]]-[[enriched functors]] on the plain [[smash product]] of finite pointed [[simplicial sets]] ([Lydakis 98](#Lydakis98)).

See also at _[[functor with smash products]]_.
