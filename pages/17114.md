## Idea

### General

The [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]] induces a smash product on [[spectra]].

This is the canonical [[tensor product]] in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra]]. There are various [[model category]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentations]] for which which are symmetric [[monoidal model categories]] (such as the [[highly structured spectra]]: [[S-modules]], [[symmetric spectra]] and [[orthogonal spectra]], but also for instance [[excisive functors]]). See at _[[symmetric monoidal category of spectra]]_ for more on this. Passing to the [[stable homotopy category]], it become a [[symmetric monoidal category]] under the smash product. Under mild assumptions, this is the essentially unique symmetric tensor product with [[unit]] the [[sphere spectrum]] ([Shipley 01](#Shipley01)).

### History

Historically the discussion proceeded in the opposite direction: available variants of the construction of smash products on [[sequential spectra]] (the "handicrafted" or "naive" smash products [Boardman 65](#Boardman65), [Adams 74, part III, section 4](#Adams74)) were found to yield a [[symmetric monoidal category]] structure _only_ after passage to the [[stable homotopy category]]. Then models via non-sequential [[highly structured spectra]] were discovered wich do admit a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] in the sense of 1-category theory, as do [[excisive functors]], see at _[[model structure on excisive functors]]_.

### As Day convolution spectra

Many versions of the smash product of spectra, [[symmetric smash product of spectra|symmetric or not]], arise as [[Day convolution]] products on a suitable [[enriched category|enriched]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]] version of a [[category]] of "index spaces".

The [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] on, in particular,  [[symmetric spectra]] and  [[orthogonal spectra]] is the Day convolution product for [[Top]]-[[enriched functors]] on monoidal categories of [[symmetric groups]] of [[orthogonal groups]], respectively ([MMSS 00, theorem 1.7 and section 21.](#MMSS00)).

Similarly the [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] on the [[model structure for excisive functors]] is Day convolution for [[sSet]]-[[enriched functors]] on the plain [[smash product]] of finite pointed [[simplicial sets]] ([Lydakis 98](#Lydakis98)).

See also at _[[functor with smash products]]_.

## Properties

### Graded commutativity
 {#GradedCommutativity}

The smash product of spectra exhibits a certain graded commutativity akin to the graded commutativity in the [[tensor product of chain complexes]] (in fact, under the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]] the latter maps to the former).

This comes down to the following basic fact about the [[smash product]] of [[pointed topological spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}
###### Proposition

There are [[homeomorphisms]] between [[n-spheres]] and their [[smash products]]

$$
  \phi_{n_1,n_2}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  S^{n_1 + n_2}
$$

such that in [[Ho(Top)]] there are [[commuting diagrams]] like so:

$$
  \array{
    (S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}) \wedge S^{n_3}
    &&\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&&
    S^{n_1} \wedge (S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_3})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\phi_{n_1,n_2} \wedge id}}\downarrow 
    && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge \phi_{n_2,n_3}}}
    \\
    S^{n_1+n_2} \wedge S^{n_3}
    && &&
    S^{n_1}\wedge S^{n_2 + }
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi_{n_1+n_2, n_3}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi_{n_1,n_2+n_3}}}
    \\
    && 
    S^{n_1+n_2 + n_3}
  }
  \,.
$$

and

$$
  \array{
    S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}
    &\stackrel{b_{n_1,n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\phi_{n_1,n_2}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_{n_2,n_1}}}
    \\
    S^{n_1 + n_2}
    &\stackrel{(-1)^{n_1 n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^{n_1 + n_2}
  }
  \,,
$$

where here $(-1)^n \colon S^n \to S^n$ denotes the homotopy class of a [[continuous function]] of [[degree of a continuous function|degree]] $(-1)^n \in \mathbb{Z} \simeq [S^n, S^n]$.


=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ realized as the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\phi_{n_1,n_2}$ is given by the identity on [[coordinates]] and the [[braiding]] homeomorphism

$$
  b_{n_1,n_2}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{S^2}
  \stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow}
  S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_2}
$$

is given by permuting the [[coordinates]]:

$$
  (x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1}, y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2})
  \mapsto
  (y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2}, x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1})
  \,.
$$

This has [[degree of a continuous map|degree]] $(-1)^{n_1 n_2}$ .

This statement passes to the [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty S^n$ of the spheres ([Adams 74, part III, prop. 4.8](#Adams74)).

+-- {: .num_remark #WhySequentialSpectraHaveNoSymmetricSmashProduct}
###### Remark

The phenomenon in prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres} is the reason why there is no [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] on plain [[sequential spectra]]:

By [this proposition](sequential+spectrum#QuillenEquivalenceBetweenSequentialBFAndExcisiveFunctors) sequential spectra are equivalently [[excisive (infinity,1)-functors]] restricted from all [[pointed homotopy types|pointed]] [[finite homotopy types]] $\infty Grpd_{fin}^{\ast/}$ to the category of standard spheres with just the adjuncts of suspension maps between them. That non-full subcategory no longer accomodates the negative [[degree of a continuous function|degree]] maps in prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres} and hence its embedding into $\infty Grpd^{\ast/}_{fin}$ is, while [[lax monoidal functor|lax monoidal]], not [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric monoidal]].
