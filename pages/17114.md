## Idea

The [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]] induces a smash product in [[spectra]].

This is the canonical [[tensor product]] in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra]]. There are various [[model category]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentations]] for which which are symmetric [[monoidal model categories]] (such as that of [[S-modules]], of [[symmetric spectra]] and of [[orthogonal spectra]]). See at _[[symmetric monoidal category of spectra]]_ for more on this.
