## Idea

For $A$ a [[commutative ring]] and $p$ a [[prime number]], then there is the  [[topological ring|topological]] [[p-completion]] $A_p^\wedge \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n A/(p^n A)$. The _analytic completion_ is instead the [[quotient]] 

$$
  A[ [ x ] ]/(x-p)A[ [ x ] ]
  \,.
$$

For $A= \mathbb{Z}$ the [[integers]] both constructions agree, up to [[isomorphism]], and yield the [[p-adic integers]]. In general though they are different.
