Differential calculus on non-finite dimensional spaces is also known as [[variational calculus]].

In the presence of [[Lie algebra]] [[action]]s a variant of differential caclulus is [[Cartan calculus]].

Since [[Hochschild homology]] and [[cyclic homology]] (see there) is closely related to differential forms and de Rham differentials, generalizations and abstractions of Hochschild (co)homology are also used as generalized _differential calculi_ .
