## Idea

_Exact real computer arithmetic_ refers to treatment of [[real number]] [[arithmetic]] on [[computers]] to finite (necessarily) but arbitrary precision. This is in contrast with what is called [[floating point arithmetic]] which uses just one fixed finite approximation of the real numbers by [[natural numbers]]. 

Exact real computer arithmetic essentially implements what in mathematical [[computability theory]] is known as the [[Type Two Theory of Effectivity|type-II theory]] (in contrast to the "type-I" theory of [[partial recursive functions]] acting just on [[natural numbers]]). The formal mathematical definition of [[computable function (analysis)]] is the core topic of [[constructive analysis]]/[[exact analysis]].
