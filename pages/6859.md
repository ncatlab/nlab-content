
__Elementary functions__ are the functions of one [[complex number|complex]] variable obtained from the [[identity function]] $x$, constant functions, the (possibly fractional) [[power function]]s $x^\gamma$, [[trigonometric function]]s, the [[exponential function]]s and [[logarithmic function]]s by the algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and [[composition]]. Elementary functions form a well-defined class. Some of them are [[multivalued function|multivalued]] and have [[singular point]]s (e.g. the square root $x^{1/2}$ has a [[branch point]] at the origin). 

Notice that trigonometric functions (e.g., $\cos x = \frac1{2}(e^{i x} + e^{-i x})$) and inverse trigonometric trigometric functions (e.g., $\arctan (x) = \frac{i}{2}(\log (1 - i x) - \log (1 + i x))$) are elementary. Were we to consider functions of a real variable generated in like manner from polynomials, the exponential function, and the logarithmic function, this would no longer be the case. 

Functions of a complex variable which are not elementary are sometimes called transcendental, although usually this term is used for the (strictly larger) class of functions that are not [[algebraic function|algebraic]].
