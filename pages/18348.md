## Definition

### Planar graphs

A **planar graph** is a [[graph]] which can be embedded into a [[surface]] of [[genus]] 0 (such as a [[sphere]] or the [[Euclidean plane]]) without crossing edges. 

### Plane graphs/planar maps

Planarity is usually considered as a [[property]] of graphs, rather than as extra [[structure]]. When the structure reading is intended, this is sometimes referred to as a "[[plane graph]]" or "[[planar map]]": that is, a graph equipped with an embedding into a genus 0 surface. In this sense, a planar graph is just a graph which is isomorphic to the underlying graph of a planar map. In particular, one graph might have multiple non-isomorphic embeddings into the plane, or it may be planar while also admitting embeddings into surfaces of higher genus (e.g., $K_4$ is planar, but can also be embedded into the [[torus]]).



## Properties

### Existence of embeddings

The existence of an embedding of an arbitrary graph $G$ into a surface of genus 0 may be tested by various _planarity criteria_, such as Kuratowski's theorem ($G$ is planar iff it does not contain a subgraph that is an edge [[subdivision]] of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$, i.e, iff $K_5, K_{3, 3}$ are not [[graph minors]] of $G$) or _Mac Lane's planarity criterion_ (the [[cycle space]] of $G$ has a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] such that no edge of $G$ appears in more than two basis vectors). 

Related to the [[Kuratowski]] and [[Mac Lane]] characterizations is the [[matroid]] characterization of [[Hassler Whitney]]: a graph is planar iff its [[matroid|graphic matroid]] is [[matroid|dual]] to another graphic matroid.
