## Idea

[[Arne Strom|Arne Strøm]] has proven that the [[category]] [[Top]] of *all* topological spaces has a structure of a Quillen [[model category]] where 

* fibrations are [[Hurewicz fibrations]], 

* cofibrations are *closed* [[Hurewicz cofibrations]] 

* and the role of weak equivalences is played by (strong) [[homotopy equivalences]]. 

The theorem might have been a folklore at the time, but the actual paper has a number of subtleties.

Strøm's proofs are not that well-known today and use techniques better known to the topologists of that time, and there is consequently a slight controversy among topologists now.  One of these is that there are modern reproofs, but these modern techniques essentially use [[compactly generated spaces]], while Strøm's proofs succeeded in avoiding that assumption. 

However, for many applications nowadays, one is mainly interested in the analogous model structure on the category of [[k-spaces]], or of [[compactly generated space]]s ([[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]] [[k-spaces]]).  Note that any cofibration in the latter category is closed.


## Properties

### Monoidal structure

The Strøm model structure on the category of [[compactly generated spaces]] is a [[monoidal model category]].  This is proven in section 6.4 of [[A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology]] (without that language) using the fact that a subspace inclusion is a Hurewicz cofibration if and only if it is an [[NDR-pair]].

### Quillen adjunctions

The identity functor $Top \to Top$ is [[Quillen adjunction|left Quillen]] from the [[model structure on topological spaces|Quillen model structure]] (or the mixed model structure) to the Strøm model structure, and of course right Quillen in the other direction.  This is just the observation that any [[Hurewicz fibration]] is a [[Serre fibration]], and any [[homotopy equivalence]] is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]---or dually, that any relative cell complex is a Hurewicz cofibration.

It follows, by composition, that the [[geometric realization]]--singular complex adjunction $ {|-|} \colon sSet \leftrightarrows Top : Sing$ is Quillen between the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] and the Strøm model structure.

### Simplicial structure

If $Top$ denotes the category of [[compactly generated space]]s, then [[geometric realization]] $ {|-|} \colon sSet \to Top$ preserves finite [[products]], and hence is a [[strong monoidal functor]].  Therefore, in this case the adjunction ${|-|} \dashv Sing$ is a [[strong monoidal Quillen adjunction]], and hence makes the Strøm model structure into a [[simplicial model category]].

### Geometric realization is a Reedy cofibrant replacement

Write $({\vert- \vert} \dashv Sing) : Top\stackrel{\overset{{|-|}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Sing}{\to}} $ [[sSet]] for the ordinary [[geometric realization]]/[[singular simplicial complex]] [[adjunction]] (see [[homotopy hypothesis]]).

For $S_{\bullet,\bullet} : \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \to Set$ a [[bisimplicial set]], write $d S$ for its [[diagonal]] $d X : \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \stackrel{S}{\to} Set$.

###### Proposition

For $X_\bullet$ any [[simplicial topological space]], there is a [[homeomorphism]] between the [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces|geometric realizaton]] of the 
[[simplicial topological space]] $[n] \mapsto |Sing(X_n)|$ and the ordinary [[geometric realization]] of the [[simplicial set]] that is the diagonal of the [[bisimplicial set]] $Sing(X_\bullet)_\bullet$

$$
  \left|[n] \mapsto |Sing(X_n)|\right|  \simeq_{iso} | d Sing(X_\bullet)_\bullet | 
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the degreewise $(|-| \dashv Sing)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]] yields a morphism

$$
 ([n] \mapsto |Sing(X_n)|) \to X_\bullet
$$

and this is a cofibrant [[resolution]] in the [[Reedy model structure]]  $[\Delta^{op}, Top_{Strom}]_{Reedy}$ relative to the Strøm model structure.
