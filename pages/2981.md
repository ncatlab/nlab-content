Strøm has proven that the category of ALL topological spaces  has a structure of Quillen [[model category]] where fibrations are Hurewicz fibrations, cofibrations are closed Hurewicz cofibration and the role of weak equivalences is played by (strong) homotopy equivalences. The theorem might have been a folklore at the time, but the actual paper has a number of subtleties. 

Strøm's proofs are not that well-known today and use techniques better known to the topologists at that time, and there is consequently a slight controversy among topologists now. One of the things is that there are modern reproofs, but these modern techniques essentially use the compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, while Strøm's proofs succeeded to avoid that assumption.
