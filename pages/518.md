This entry is about the article

* Kenneth S. Brown, _[[BrownAbstractHomotopyTheory.pdf:file]]_, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 186 (1973), 419-458 ([JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1996573)) .

Brown was a student of [[Dan Quillen]]. He expands in this article work from his thesis on a notion of [[homotopical category]] -- called a [[category of fibrant objects]] -- with a bit less structure than that of a full [[model category]], which he uses to study "generalized [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]": 

Following, or rather as a precursor of, the [[nPOV]] on [[cohomology]] he studies precisely the cohomology within [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es and, in the second part of the article, that in [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaf|(∞,1)-sheaves]] of [[spectrum|spectra]], see at _[[sheaves of spectra]]_.

As such, this article is a forerunner of the development of the full [[model category]] structures built for the purpose of [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes|modelling ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]]: the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model structure on simplicial (pre)sheaves]] as first defined by [[Andre Joyal]] in his letter to Grothendieck and then later generalized from simplicial sheaves to [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] and developed in great detail by Jardine (in its injective version) and [[Dan Dugger]] (in its projective version). 

[[combinatorial model category|Dugger's theorem]] that every [[combinatorial model category]] is a left [[Bousfield localization of model categories|Bousfield localization]] of the projective global [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] was finally understood by [[Jacob Lurie]] in the book [[Higher Topos Theory]] to be the [[model category]]-theoretic version of the intrinsic [[higher category theory]] statement that every [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] is the left [[localization of an (∞,1)-category]] of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]], and that the left _exact_ such localizations are precisely the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves]] -- the [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es.

But the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy category]] of these [[(∞,1)-topos]]es -- that category which remembers just the [[∞-stack]] [[cohomology]] classes, and not the [[cocycle]]s -- is precisely what Kenneth Brown constructed, studied and identified correctly in its nature back then in 1973.
