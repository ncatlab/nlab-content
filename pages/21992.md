Given an $n$-dimensional curve in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $E^n$, with a $C^{n+1}$-differentiable parametrization by the arc length from a fixed poin on the curve 
$$ F:I\to E^n, s\mapsto F(s), $$
(=[[naturally parametrized curve]] of smoothness class $C^{n+1}$), __Frenet-Serret formulas__ express the derivatives with respect to the arc length of the Frenet moving frame vectors as a linear combination of the Frenet moving frame vectors where the coefficients form an antisymmetric matrix whose nonzero coefficients are (up to sign) the curvature of the curve, torsion and their higher analogues. 

Suppose the derivatives 
$$ F^{(k)}(s) = d^k F/d s^k\in T^k_{F(s)} E^n\cong\mathbf{R}^n,\,\,\,\,\,k = 1,\ldots,n$$ 
are linearly independent at each point (assuming the canonical identification with $\mathbf{R}^n$). The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure then transforms $n$-tuple
$(F^{(1)}(s),\ldots,F^{(n)}(s))$ into an orthogonal $n$-frame $(V_1(s),\ldots,V_n(s))$ called the __Frenet $n$-frame__. Writing down the $n$-tuple of the derivatives with respect to $s$ of the Frenet frame in a $C^0(\mathbf{R})$-basis formed by the Frenet frame reveals an antisymmetric matrix of coefficients over $C^0(\mathbf{R})$. Its nonzero coefficients are, up to a sign, the curvature of the curve, torsion and their higher analogues. In dimension $n=3$, the Frenet frame vectors are called the tangent, normal and binormal unit vectors; in dimension 4 the 4th vector is called the trinormal unit vector. The plane spanned by the tangent and normal unit vectors is called the osculating plane at $F(s)$.
