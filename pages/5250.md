In the context of [[directed homotopy theory]] the **future cone** of a point, $x$, in a [[directed topological space]] is, more-or-less, the directed subspace of those point $y$ which are greater than $x$. In case the space might not be that 'nice' or, for instance, we have a local partial order rather than a global one, it is preferable to say that it is the directed space of points, $y$, for which there is a distinguished path from $x$ to $y$.

This is related to the future light cones in relativistic physics.


##Dual

The dual concept is the **past cone**.
