## Idea

Certain [[scattering amplitudes]] in [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] and neighbouring [[gauge theories]] -- called _maximally helicity violating amplitudes_ ("MHV amplitudes") simplify drastically as compared to the generic situation and in fact are controled by a certain [[twistor string theory]] whose [[target space]] is a [[twistor space]]. See ([Monteiro](#Monteiro)) for a review.
