Assume first that $X$ is $T_0$. Then we need to show that if $x,y \in X$ are such that
$Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$ then $x = y$. Hence assume that $Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$.
Since the closure of a point is the [[complements]] of the union of the open subsets not containing the point,
this means that the union of open subsets that do not contain $x$
is the same as the union of open subsets that do not contain $y$. 

$$
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{x\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
  \;=\;
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{y\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
$$

But if the two points were distinct, $x \neq y$, then by $T_0$ one of the above unions would contain $x$ or $y$, while the other would not, in contradiction to the above equality. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

Conversely, assume that if $x,y \in X$ are such that $Cl\{x\} = Cl\{y\}$ then $x = y$.
We need to show that if $x \neq y$ then there exists an open neighbourhood around one of the
two points not containing the other. 

Hence assume that $x \neq y$.
By assumption it follows that $Cl(\{x\} \neq Cl(\{y\})$, hence that now

$$
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{x\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
  \;\neq\;
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{y\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
 \,.
$$

This means that there must be at least one open subset which contains $x$ but not $y$, or vice versa.
