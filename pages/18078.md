This means that the wave front set consists of the element of the form $(x, (k, -k))$ with $k \neq 0$. Since $k$ and $-k$ are both in the [[future cone]] or both in the past cone precisely if $k = 0$, this situation is excluded in the wave front set and hence the distribution $g \cdot \delta(-,-)$ is microcausal.
