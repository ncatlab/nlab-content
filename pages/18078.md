Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]] and let $A, B \subset X$ be two [[closed subsets]] which are disjoint

$$
  A \cap B = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

Then for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $ a \in \{0, \cdots, 2^n-1\}$ there exists [[open subsets]] $U_{a/2^n}, V_{a/2^n}$ such that 

1. $U_{a/2^n} \supset A$ and $V_{a/2^n} \supset B$ (they are open neighbourhoods of $A$ and $B$, respectively)

1. $U_{a/2^n} \cap V_{a/2^n} = \emptyset$ (they are disjoint at the same index value)

1. if $a_1/2^{n_1} \lt a_2/2^{n_2}$ then 

   $U_{a_1/2^{n_1}} \subset X \backslash V_{a_1/2^{n_1}} \subset U_{a_2/s^2^{n_2}}$



Define

$$
  U(1) \coloneqq X \backlash B
  \phantom{AAA}
  V(1) \coloneqq X \backslash A
$$

By normality, we may find open neighbourhoods

$$
  U(1/2) \supset A
  \phantom{AAA}
  V(1/2) \supset B
$$

$$
  A \subset U(1/2) \subset U(1)
$$
