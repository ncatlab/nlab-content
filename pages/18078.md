###### Proposition
**([[universal property]] of the [[mapping space]])**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$, $(Y, \tau_Y)$, $(Z, \tau_Z)$ 
be [[topological spaces]], with $X$ [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}).
Then

1. The [[evaluation]] function

   $$
     \array{
       (X, \tau_X) \times Maps((X,\tau_X), (Y, \tau_Y))
         & \overset{\phantom{AA} ev \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}&
       (Y, \tau_Y)
       \\
       (x, f)
         &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
       f(x)
     }
   $$

   is a [[continuous function]].

1. The [[natural bijection]] of [[function sets]]

   $$
     \array{
       \underset
       {Hom_{Set}(X \times Z, Y) }
       {\underbrace{
         \left\{
            X \times Y \longrightarrow Y
         \right\}
       }}
         &\underoverset{}{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}&
       \underset
       {Hom_{Set}\left( Z, Hom_{Set}(X,Y) \right)}
       {\underbrace{
         \left\{
            Z \longrightarrow Hom_{Set}(X,Y)
         \right\}
       }}
       \\
       \left(f \colon (x,z) \mapsto f(x,z) \right)
         &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& 
       \tilde f 
       \colon
         z \mapsto (x \mapsto f(x,z))
     }
   $$
   
   restricts to a [[natural bijection]] between sets of [[continuous functions]]

   $$
     \array{
       \underset
         {Hom_{Top}((X, \tau_X) \times (Z, \tau_Z), (Y, \tau_Y))}
       {\underbrace{\left\{
          (X,\tau_X) \times (Z, \tau_Z) \overset{cts}{\longrightarrow} (Y, \tau_Y)
       \right\}}}
         &\underoverset{}{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}&
       \underset
         {Hom_{Top}\left( (Z, \tau_Z) , Maps((X,\tau_X), (Y, \tau_Y)) \right)}
       {\underbrace{\left\{
          (Z, \tau_Z) \overset{cts}{\longrightarrow} Maps( (X,\tau_X), (Y,\tau_Y) )
       \right\}}}
     }
     \,.
   $$
   


Here $Maps((X,\tau_X), (Y,\tau_Y))$ is the [[mapping space]] with [[compact-open topology]] from example \ref{CompactOpenTopology}
and $(-)\times (-)$ denotes forming the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}).

###### Proof

To see the continuity of the evaluation map:

Let $V \subset Y$ be an open subset. We need to show that $ev^{-1}(V) = \{(x, f) \vert f(x) \in V\}$ 
is a union of products of the form $U \times V^K$ with $U\subset X$ open and $U^K \subset Hom_{Set}(K,U)$ a basic open according to def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}.

For $(x, f) \in ev^{-1}(V)$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V) \subset X$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$, by continuity of $f$.
By local compactness of $X$, there is a compact subset $K \subset f^{-1}(V)$ which is still a neighbourhood of $x$. 
Since $f$ also still takes that into $V$,
we have found an open neighbourhood 

$$
  (x,f) \in {K \times V^K} \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} ev^{-1}(V)
$$

with respect to the product topology. Since this is still contained in $ev^{-1}(V)$, for all $(x,f)$ as above, 
$ev^{-1}(V)$ is exhibited
as a union of opens, and is hence itself open.

Regarding the second point:

In one direction, let $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \times (Y, \tau_Y) \to (Z \, \tau_Z)$ be a continuous function, and let $U^K \subset Maps(X,Y)$
be a sub-basic open. We need to show that the set

$$
  \tilde f^{-1}(U)
    =
  \left\{
    z \in Z \;\vert\;  f(K,z) \subset U
  \right\}
   \;\subset\; 
  Z
$$

is open. To that end, observe that $f(K,z) \subset U$ means that $K \times \{z\} \subset f^{-1}(U)$, where $f^{-1}(U) \subset X \times Y$ is open by the continuity of $f$.
Hence in the [[topological subspace]] $K \times Z \subset X \times Y$ the inclusion

$$
  K \times \{z\} \subset \left( f^{-1}(U) \cap (K \times Z) \right)
$$

is an open neighbourhood. Since $K$ is compact, the [[tube lemma]] (prop. \ref{TheTubeLemma}) gives an 
open neighbourhood $V_z \supset \{z\}$ in $Y$, hence an open neighbourhood $K \times V_z \subset K \times Y$,
which is still contained in the original pre-image:

$$
  K \times V_z \;\subset\; f^{-1}(U) \cap (K \times Z) \;\subset\; f^{-1}(U)
  \,.
$$

This shows that with every point $z \in \tilde f^{-1}\left(U^K\right)$ also an open neighbourhood of $z$ is contained in $\tilde f^{-1}\left(U^K\right)$,
hence that the latter is a union of open subsets, and hence itself open.

In the other direction, assume that $\tilde f \colon Z \to Maps((X,\tau_X),(Y,\tau_Y))$ is continuous:
We need to show that $f$ is continuous. But observe that $f$ is the [[composition|composite]]

$$
  f 
  =
  (X, \tau_X) \times (Z,\tau_Z)
    \overset{id{(X,\tau_X)} \times \tilde f}{\longrightarrow}
  (X, \tau_X)
  \times
  Maps((X,\tau_X), (Y,\tau_Y))
    \overset{ev}{\longrightarrow}
  (X,\tau_X)
  \,.
$$

Here the first function $id \times \tilde f$ is continuous since $\tilde f$ is by assumption since the product of two continuous functions
is again continuous (example \ref{FunctorialProductSpace}). The second function $ev$ is continuous by the first point above.
hence $f$ is continuous.
