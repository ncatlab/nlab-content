###### Example
**([[superfields]])**

Let $X$ be a [[supermanifold]] (for instance a [[super spacetime]]) and consider
the super-[[mapping space]] $[X,\mathbb{R}]$ (or $[X,\mathbb{C}]$) of real (or complex)
valued functions on $X$ ("[[scalar fields]]"). We may
understand the [[generalized elements]] of this superspace via its [[functor of points]] which,
via prop. \ref{SheavesHomInternal}, is given by the assignment

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}
      \mapsto
    Hom( X \times \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}, \mathbb{R} )
    \\
    &
      \simeq
    C^\infty(X \times \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q})_{even}
    \\
    &
      \simeq
    \left( C^\infty(X) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \wedge^\bullet \langle \theta_1, \cdots, \theta_q\rangle\right)_{even}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here in the first line on the right we have the set of maps of supermanifolds of the form $X \times \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q} \to \mathbb{R}$,
which, by the [[Yoneda lemma]], is equivalently just the even subalgebra of the super-algebra of functions
on $X \times \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}$, which finally is equivalently the even elements in the
[[tensor product]] of the super-algebra of functions on $X$ with the [[Grassmann algebra]] on $q$ odd generators
$\theta_i$.

Now an element in this tensor product is of the form

$$
  f
  +
  \underoverset{i = 1}{q}{\sum}
  g_i \theta_i
  +
  \underoverset{i,j = 1}{q}{\sum}
    f_{i j} \theta_i \theta_j
  +
  \underoverset{i,j,k = 1}{q}{\sum}
  g_{i j k} \theta_i \theta_j \theta_j
  +
  \cdots
$$

for any  $f_{\cdots} \in C^\infty(X)_{even}$ and $g_{\cdots} \in C^\infty(X)_{odd}$.

Notice that here if $X$ is of superdimension $(d_X,q_X)$, then this expansion becomes redundant for
$q \gt q_X$: The [[functor of points]] provides an arbitrary supply of auxiliary Grassmann coordinates
$\theta$, only some of which ill typically be of non-redundant use for any given superspace.

In [[physics]], such a [[linear combination]] of even and odd component functions multipled with
Grassmann algebra elements to yield a homogeneously graded sum is called a _[[superfield]]_.

In order to make sense of this, some physics textbooks posit an single "infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra"
from which to draw the elements $\theta_i$. This approach has its pitfalls [Sachse 08](#Sachse08).
The [[functorial geometry]] perspecive (remark \ref{ASheafAsASpace}) fixes this: the "arbitrary supply"
of Grassmann variables is encoded by saying that

1. for each finite dimensional Grassmann algebra $\wedge^\bullet \langle \thets_1, \cdots, \theta_q\rangle = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{0\vert q})$
   superfields have an expansion in terms of the generators $\theta_i$;

1. these expressions are _covariant_ with respect to change of Grassmann coordinates $\mathbb{R}^{0\vert q} \to \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q'}$.

There are of course the evident generalizations of the scalar valued superfields along the same lines. 
In general there is a (super-)[[fiber bundle]] $E \overset{\pi}{\to} X$ over ([[super spacetime|super]]) [[spacetime]] $X$ 
called the (super)-[[field bundle]] such that a field on $X$ is a [[section]] of the field bundle
(see also at _[[fiber bundles in physics]]_). The super-space of sections of $E$ is the following 
[[fiber product]] of the [[mapping space]] 

$$
  \Gamma_X(E)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  [X,E] \underset{[X,X]}{\times} \{id_X\}
  \,,
$$

i.e. the super-space with the [[universal property]] that it makes the follwing [[commuting square|square commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma_X(E) &\longrightarrow& [X,E]
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{X,\pi}}
    \\
    \{id_X\} &\hookrightarrow& [X,X]
  }
  \,.
$$

Then a [[superfield]] with values in $E$ is a [[generalized element]] of $\Gamma_X(E)$. By the
[[functorial geometry]]this means that field is over every
superpoint $\mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}$ a homomorphism $\psi \colon X \times \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}$
such that

$$
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\psi}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    X \times \mathbb{R}^{0 \vert q}
    &\underset{pr_1}{\longrightarrow}&
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

In a typical example $X$ is an ordinary [[smooth manifold]] with [[spin structure]] and $E = \Pi S$
is the odd version (according to example \ref{OddTangentBundle}) of a [[spinor bundle]] on $X$.

Then an element of $[X,\Pi S]$ is

1. over $\mathbb{R}^{0\vert 0}$ no information;

1. over $\mathbb{R}^{0 \vert 1}$ an element $\psi \theta$ with $\psi \in \Gamma_X(S)$ an ordinary section of the 
   [[spinor bundle]] (hence a [[spinor field]]).
   
and so on.

This may be combined. For example if $\underline{\mathbb{C}} \oplus_X \Pi $ is the [[direct sum of vector bundles]] of the 
[[trivial vector buundle trivial]] [[complex line bundle]] with an odd [[spinor bundle]], then a [[generalized element]]
of $\Gamma_X(\underline{\mathbb{C}} \oplus_X \Pi S )$ is over $\mathbb{R}^{0\vert 1}$ of the form

$$
  \sigma = \phi + \psi \thetable
$$

where $\phi$ is a complex-vaued [[scalar field]] and $\psi$ again a section of the spinor bundle.

This way [[bosonic fields]] and [[fermionic fields]] may be combined into a singe [[superfield]]
(see also at _[[super multiplet]]_).
