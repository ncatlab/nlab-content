###### Example
**(Zariski closed subsets in affine space via Galois connection)**


Let $k$ be a [[field]] and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and write $k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ for the [[polynomial ring]] over $k$  in $n$ [[variables]].  Define a [[relation]] 

$$
  E \hookrightarrow k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \times k^n
$$

by 

$$
  E(f, x)\coloneqq \left( f(x) = 0\right)
  \,.
$$

By def. \ref{GaloisConnection} and prop. \ref{GaloisConnectionAsAdjunction} we obtain the corresponding [[Galois connection]] of the form

$$
  P(k[X_1, \cdots, X_n])
     \underoverset{\underset{V_E}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{I_E}{\longleftarrow}}{\bot}
  P(k^n)^{op}
$$

(where now $k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ and $k^n$ denote their underlying sets).

Here by def. \ref{GaloisConnection} the function

$$
  V_E \;\colon\; P(k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]) \longrightarrow P(k^n)
$$ 

sends a set $\mathcal{F}$ of [[polynomials]]  to its corresponding *[[variety]]*, 

$$
  V_E(\mathcal{F}) = \{\vec x \in k^n \,\vert\, \forall_{f \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]} \; (f \in \mathcal{F}) \Rightarrow (f(x) = 0)\}
  \,.
$$

These are just the Zariski closed subsets from def. \ref{ZariskiOpenSubsetsOnAffineSpace}.

In the other direction, 

$$
  I_E \;\colon\; P(k^n) \longrightarrow P(k[x_1, \ldots, x_n])
$$ 

sends a set of points $T \subseteq k^n$ to its corresponding *[[vanishing ideal]]* 

$$
  I_E(T) = \{f \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \,\vert\, \forall_{x: k^n} \; x \in T \Rightarrow f(x) = 0\}
$$

which we considered earlier in def. \ref{VanishingIdeal}.

We may now use the abstract theory of Galois connections to verify that Zariski closed subsets form a [[topological space|topology]]:

###### Proposition

Using [[excluded middle]], then:

The set of Zariski closed subsets of $k^n$ from example \ref{ZariskiClosedSubsetsInaffineViaGalois} constitutes a [[topological space|topology]] in that it is closed under

1. arbitrary intersections;

1. finite untions.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first point: From prop. \ref{GaloisConnectionAsAdjunction} we know that $V_E$ takes unions to intersections, hence that

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cap} V_E(\mathcal{F}_i) 
  \;=\;
  V_E\left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \mathcal{F}_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Regarding the second point, we exploit the [[commutative ring]] structure of $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$. It is sufficient to show that the set of Zariski closed sets is closed under the empty union and under binary unions.

The empty union is the entire space $k^n$, which is $V(1)$ (the variety associated with the constant polynomial $1$), 

Hence it only remains to see closure under binary unions.

To this end, recall from prop. \ref{GaloisClosureOperator} that we may replace $\mathcal{F}$ with the corresponding ideal

$$
  I \coloneqq I_E \circ V_E(\mathcal{F})
$$ 

without changing the variety:

$$
  V_E(I) = V_E(\mathcal{F})
  \,.
$$

With this it is sufficient to show that

$$
  V_E(I) \cup V_E(I') = V(I \cdot I')
$$ 

where $I \cdot I'$ is the ideal consisting of finite sums of elements of the form $f g$ with $f \in I$ and $g \in I'$. 

We conclude by proving this statement:

Applying the contravariant operator $V_E$ to the inclusions $I \cdot I' \subseteq I$ and $I \cdot I' subseteq I'$ (which are clear since $I, I'$ are ideals), we derive $V_E(I) \subseteq V_E(I \cdot I')$ and $V_E(I') \subseteq V(I \cdot I')$, so the inclusion $V_E(I) \cup V_E(I') \subseteq V(I \cdot I')$ is automatic. 

In the other direction, to prove $V(I \cdot I') \subseteq V_E(I) \cup V(I')$, suppose $x \in V(I \cdot I')$ and that $x$ *doesn't* belong to $V(I)$. Then $f(x) \neq 0$ for some $f \in I$. For every $g \in I'$, we have $f(x)g(x) = (f \cdot g)(x) = 0$ since $f \cdot g \in I \cdot I'$ and $x \in V_E(I \cdot I')$. Now divide by $f(x)$ to get $g(x) = 0$ for every $g \in I'$, so that $x \in V_E(I')$.
