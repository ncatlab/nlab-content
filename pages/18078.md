###### Proposition
**(topology detected by nets)**

Using the [[axiom of choice]] then:

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Then a [[subset]] $(U \subset X)$ is [[open subset|open]] in $X$ (is an element of $\tau \subset P(X)$) precisely if its [[complement]] $X \backslash S$ is a [[closed subset]] as seen not just by sequences but by nets, in that no [[net]] with elements in $X\backslash S$,  $\nu \colon A \to X\backslash S \hookrightarrow X$, [[converges]] to an element in $S$.

###### Proof

In one direction, let $S \subset X$ be open, and consider a net $\nu \colon A \to X \backslash S \subset X$. We need to show that for every point $x \in S$, $x$ is not a limiting point of the net.

But by assumption then $S$ is a [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ which does not contain any element of the net, and so by definition of convergence it is not a limit of this net.

Conversely, let $S \subset X$ be a subset that is not open. We need to show that then there exists a net $\nu \colon A \to X\backslash S \subset X$ that converges to a point in $S$.

For $x \in X$, consider the [[directed set]] $Nbhd_X(x)$ of [[open neighbourhoods]] of this element (example \ref{DirectedSetOfNeighbourhods}).
Now the fact that the set $S$ is not open means that there exists an element $s \in S \subset X$ such that every [[open neighbourhood]] $U$ of $s$ intersects $X \backslash S$. This means that we may [[axiom of choice|choose]] elements $x_U \in U \cap (X \backslash S)$, and hence define a net

$$
  \array{
    Nbhds_X(s) &\overset{\nu}{\longrightarrow}& X \backslash S  \subset X
    \\
    U &\mapsto& x_U
  }
  \,.
$$

But by construction this net has the property that for every neighbourhood $V$ of $s$ there exists $U \in Nbhd_X(s)$ such that for all $U' \subset U$ then $x_{U'} \in V$, namely $U = V$. Hence the net converges to $s$.

###### Proposition
**(continuous functions detected by nets)**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be two [[topological space]]. Then a [[function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ between their underlying sets is [[continuous function|continuous]] precisely if for every net $\vu \colon A \to X$ that converges to some $x \in X$, the net $f\circ \vu$ converges to  $f(y)\in Y$.

###### Proof

In one direction, suppose that $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous, and that $\nu \colon A \to X$ converges to some $x \in X$. We need to show that $f \citc \nu$ converges to $f(y) \in Y$, hence that for every neighbourhood $U_{f(y)} \subset Y$ there exists $i \in A$ such that $f(\nu(j)) \in U_{f(y)}$ for all $j \geq i$.

But since $f$ is continuous, the [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(U_{f(y)}) \subset X$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$, and so by the assumption that $\nu$ converges there is an $i \in A$ such that $\nu(j) \in f^{-1}(U_{f(y)})$ for all $j \geq i$. By applying $f$, this is the required statement.

Conversely, suppose that $f$ is not continuous, and that the net $\nu$ converges to some $x \in X$. We need to show that then $f \circ \nu$ does not converge to $f(x)$.

Now that $f$ is not continuous means that there exists an open subset $U \subset Y$ such that the pre-image $f^{-1}(U)$ is not open. By prop. \ref{TopologyDetectedByNets} this means that there exists a net $\nu$ in $X \backslash f^{-1}(U)$ that converges to an element $x \in f^{-1}(U)$. But this means that $f \circ \nu$ is a net in the $Y \backslash U$, which is a [[closed subset]] by the assumption that $U$ is open. Again by prop. \ref{TopologyDetectedByNets} this means that $f\circ \nu$ converges to an element in $Y \backslash U$, and hence not to $f(x) \in U$.
