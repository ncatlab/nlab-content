topologically distinct surfaces

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]] and let $A, B \subset X$ be two [[closed subsets]] which are disjoint


Set

$$
  C_0 \coloneqq A
  \phantom{AAA}
  U_1 \coloneqq X \backslash B
  \,.
$$

Since by assumption

$$
  A \cap B = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

we have 

$$
  C_0 \subset U_1
  \,.
$$

Recall that (by [this lemma](separation+axioms#T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures)) if a space is normal then every open neighbourhood $U \supset C$ of closed subset $C$ contains a smaller neighbourhood $V$ together with its closure $Cl(V)$

$$
  U \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset C
  \,.
$$

Apply this fact successively to the above situation to obtain the following infinite sequence of nested open/closed subsets 

$$
  \array{
    C_0 &&  &&  &&  &\subset&  &&  &&  && U_1
    \\
    C_0 &&  &\subset&  && U_{1/2} &\subset& C_{1/2} &&  &\subset&  && U_1
    \\
    C_0 &\subset& U_{1/4} &\subset& C_{1/4} &\subset& U_{1/2} &\subset& C_{1/2} &\subset& U_{3/4} &\subset& C_{3/4} &\subset& U_1
  }
$$

and so on.

This produces a set of open subsets labeled by the [[dyadic rational numbers]]

$$
 \{ U_{r} \subset X \}_{r \in \mathbb{Q}_{dy}}
$$

with the property that 

$$
  \underset{r \in \mathbb{Q}_{dy}}{\forall}
  \left(
     A \subset U_r \subset X\backslash B
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  \left(
     r_1 \lt r_2
  \right)
   \Rightarrow
  \left(
     \left(U_{r_1} \subset U_{r_2}\right)
     \,\text{and}\,
     \left(
      U_1 \neq U_2
     \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Define then the function

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow [0,1]
$$

to assign to a point $x \in X$ the [[infimum]] of the labels of those open subsets in this sequence that contain $x$:

$$
  f(x) 
     \coloneqq
  inf\left\{ r \,\vert\,  x\in U_r \right\}
$$


This function clearly has the property that $f(A) = \{0\}$  and $f(B) = \{1\}$. It only remains to see that it is continuous.

Observe that for $\alpha \in [0,1]$ then

$$
  f^{-1}((\alpha, 1])
    =
  \underset{r \gt \alpha}{\cup} U_r
$$

and

$$
  f^{-1}([0,\alpha))
    =
  \underset{r \lt \alpha}{\cup} U_r
$$

These are open subsets. Now every [[topological basis|basic]] open subset of $[0,1]$ is a finite intersection of those of the form $[0,\alpha)$ and $(\alpha, 1]$, and hence all pre-images undr $f$ of these are open. Therefore $f$ is continuous.
