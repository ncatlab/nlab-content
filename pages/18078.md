###### Proposition
**([[prime ideal theorem]])

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] or at least the [[ultrafilter principle]] then:

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]] and $I \subset R$ a [[proper ideal]], then $I$ is contained in some [[prime ideal]].

=--

The [[axiom of choice]] even implies that every proper ideal is contained in a [[maximal ideal]] (by [this prop.](maximal+ideal#EveryProperIdealisContainedInAMaximalOne)).
