###### Example

Let $k$ be a [[field]], let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and write $k[X_1, \cdots, X_n]$ for the [[polynomial ring]] over $k$ in $n$ [[variables]], and $MaxIdl(k[X_1, \cdots, X_n])$ for the [[set]] of [[maximal ideals]] in this ring. 

Define then a [[relation]] 

$$
  E \hookrightarrow k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \times MaxIdeal(k[x_1, \ldots, x_n])
$$ 

by 

$$
  E(f, M) \Leftrightarrow (f \in M)
  \,.
$$

For a subset $T \subseteq MaxIdl(k[x_1, \ldots, x_n])$ we calculate 

$$
  I_E(T) = \{f \in k[x_1, ldots, x_n]: \forall_{\mathfrak{m} \in MaxIdl} M \in S \Rightarrow f \in \mathfrak{m}\} = \bigcap_{\mathfrak{m} \in S} \mathfrak{m}
$$ 

which is an ideal, since the intersection of any collection of ideals is again an ideal. (However, not all ideals are given as intersections of maximal ideals, a point to which we will return in a moment.)

###### Remark

This is a slight generalization of example \ref{ZariskiClosedSubsetsInaffineViaGalois} since each point $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ induces a maximal ideal 

$$
  \mathfrak{m}_a \coloneqq \langle x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n \rangle
  \,,
$$

i.e. the [[kernel]] of the function 

$$
  \array{
    k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] &\longrightarrow& k
    \\
    f &\mapsto& f(a)
  }
$$ 

which evaluates polynomials $f$ at the point $a$, where we have $f(a) = 0$ iff $f \in \mathfrak{m}_a$. 

Of course it need not be the case that all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ are given by points in this way; for example, the ideal $(x^2 + 1)$ is maximal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ but is not given by evaluation at a point because $x^2 + 1$ does not vanish at any real point. However, if the [[ground field]] $k$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], then every maximal ideal of $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is given by evaluation at a point $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$. This result is not completely obvious; it is sometimes called the "weak [[Nullstellensatz]]".

###### Proposition

The set $S \subseteq k^n$ that are closed under the operator $V_E \circ I_E: P(k^n) \to P(k^n)$ in example \ref{ZariskiTopologyOnMaximalIdealsOfPolynomialRingViaGaloisConnection} form a [[topology]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The proof is virtually the same as in the proof of prop. \ref{ZariskiTopologyOnAffineSpaceViaGaloisConnectionWellDefined}: they are closed under arbitrary intersections by our earlier generalities, and they are closed under finite unions by the similar reasoning: $V_E(S) = V_E(I)$ where $I = I_E \circ V_E(S)$ is an ideal, so there is no loss of generality in considering $V_E(I)$ for ideals $I$, and $V_E(I) \cup V_E(I') = V_E(I \cdot I')$. If $\mathfrak{m} \in V_E(I \cdot I')$ (meaning $I \cdot I' \subseteq M$) but $\mthfrak{m}$ *doesn't* belong to $V_E(I)$, i.e., $f \notin \mathfrak{m}$ for some $f \in I$, then for every $g \in I'$ we have $f \cdot g \in \mathfrak{m}$. Taking the [[quotient]] map $\pi: R \to R/\mathfrak{m}$ to the field $R/\mathfrak{m}$, we have $\pi(f \cdot g) = \pi(f)\cdot \pi(g) = 0$, and since $\pi(f) \neq 0$ we have $\pi(g) = 0$ for every $g \in I'$, hence $\mathfrak{m} \in V_E(I')$.

Thus the fixed elements of $V_E \circ I_E$ on one side of the Galois correspondence are the closed sets of a topology. The fixed elements of $I_E \circ V_E$ on the other side are a matter of interest; in the case where $k$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], they are the *[[radical ideals]]* of $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ according to the "strong [[Nullstellensatz]].
