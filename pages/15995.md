## Idea ##
The Crane-Yetter model is a [[4d TQFT]], not to be confused with the [[Yetter model]].

It was defined originally as a state sum in [State-Sum Invariants of 4-Manifolds](#CraneYetterKauffman94).
One labels the elements of a triangulation with objects and morphisms of a [[ribbon category|ribbon]] [[fusion category]], usually the [[representation category]] of a [[quasitriangular Hopf algebra]], or [[quantum group]].

(The [[Yetter model]], on the contrary, is defined for a finite [[2-group]].)

## Relation to Turaev-Viro model on the boundary ##

The [[3d TQFT]] [[Turaev-Viro model]] is a [[boundary field theory]] of the Crane-Yetter model ([Barrett&Garcia-Islas&Martins 04, theorem 2](#BarrettGarciIslasMartins04)).

### As a fully extended TQFT ###
It can be understood as an [[extended TQFT|extended topological quantum field theory]], see [[4-3-2 8-7-6]].

## Relation to BF-theory and Dijkgraaf-Witten theory ##

It is expected that the classical limit of the Crane-Yetter TQFT is [[BF theory]].
See [John Baez's article](#Baez95).
A state sum model like the Crane-Yetter model, but with a classical Lie group, would be the [[Ooguri model]].
We could understand the Crane-Yetter as a [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] with a quantum group instead of a classical group, whereas the Yetter model is a Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with a 2-group.
