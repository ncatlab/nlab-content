## Idea

A [[Lorentzian manifold]] is called _globally hyperbolic_ if it admits a well-defined time evolution from initial data of [[field (physics)|physical fields]] on it.


## Definition

There are several equivalent definitions of global hyperbolicity. A simple one is:

###### Definition

A [[Lorentzian manifold]] (without [[boundary]]) is called **globally hyperbolic** if it contains a [[Cauchy surface]].

=--

In this form the characterization of global hyperbolicity appears for instance in the paragraph at the bottom of page 211 in ([HE](#LargeScale)).
The equivalence of this to more traditional definitions is ([HE, prop. 6.6.3](#LargeScale)) together with ([HE, prop. 6.6.8](#LargeScale)), due to ([Geroch1970](#Geroch)). The latter in fact implies the following stronger statement:

###### Proposition

A [[Lorentzian manifold]] (without [[boundary]]) is **globally hyperbolic** if it admits a [[foliation]] by [[Cauchy surfaces]].

###### Remark

So in particular for a globally hyperbolic spacetime $X$ there is a [[homeomorphism]] 

$$
  \phi\colon \mathbb{R} \times \Sigma \to X
$$

from the [[product]] of the [[real line]] with a $(dim X - 1)$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma$ and for each $t \in \mathbb{R}$ the image $\phi(t, \Sigma) \subset X$ is a [[Cauchy surface]] of $X$.

A _time orientation_ of a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian spacetime is a choice of [[orientation]] of the factor $\mathbb{R}$ under the above homeomorphism.
