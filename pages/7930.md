A [[representation]] of the [[spin group]].

## Definition
 {#Definition}

+-- {: .num_defn #QuadraticVectorSpace}
###### Definition


A _quadratic vector space_ $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ is a [[vector space]] $V$ over finite [[dimension]] over a [[field]] $k$ of [[characteristic]] 0, and equipped with a symmetric [[bilinear form]] $\langle -,-\rangle \colon V \otimes V \to k$.

=--

Conventions as in ([Varadarajan 04, section 5.3](#Varadarajan04)).

We write $q\colon v \mapsto \langle v ,v \rangle$ for the corresponding [[quadratic form]].

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The _[[Clifford algebra]]_ $CL(V,q)$ of a quadratic vector space, def. \ref{QuadraticVectorSpace}, is the [[associative algebra]] over $k$ which is the [[quotient]]

$$
  Cl(V,q)
    \coloneqq
  T(V)/I(V,q)
$$ 

of the [[tensor algebra]] of $V$ by the ideal generated by the elements $v \otimes v - q(v)$.

=--

Since the [[tensor algebra]] $T(V)$ is naturally $\mathbb{Z}$-graded, the Clifford algebra $Cl(V,q)$ is naturally $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded.

Let $(\mathbb{R}^n, q = {\vert \vert})$ be the $n$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] with its canonical [[scalar product]]. Write $Cl^\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the [[complexification]] of its [[Clifford algebra]].


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There exists a unique [[complex number|complex]] [[representation]] 

$$
  Cl^{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{R}^n) \longrightarrow End(\Delta_n)
$$

of the algebra $Cl^\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of smallest [[dimension]]

$$
  dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Delta_n) = 2^{[n/2]}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn #SpinGroup}
###### Definition

The [[Spin group]] $Spin(V,q)$ of a quadratic vector space, def. \ref{QuadraticVectorSpace}, is the [[subgroup]] of the [[group of units]] in the [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V,q)$ 

$$
  Spin(V,q)\hookrightarrow GL_1(Cl(V,q))
$$

on those elements which are even number multiples $v_1 \cdots v_{2k}$ of elements $v_i \in V$ with $q(V) = 1$.

Specifically, "the" Spin group is

$$
  Spin(n) \coloneqq Spin(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \,.
$$

=--

A _spin representation_ is a [[linear representation]] of the spin group, def. \ref{SpinGroup}.


## Properties
 {#Properties}

### Complex representations

Complex [[representations]] of the [[spin group]] follow a mod-2 [[Bott periodicity]].

In even $d = 2n$ there are two inequivalent complex-linear [[irreducible representations]] of $Spin(d-1,1)$, each of complex [[dimension]] $2^{d/2-1}$, called the two _chiral_ representations, or the two _Weyl spinor_ representations.

For instance for $d = 10$ one often writes these as $\mathbf{16}$ and $\mathbf{16}'$. 

The [[direct sum]] of the two chiral representation is called the _Dirac spinor_ representation, for instance $\mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16}'$.

In odd $d = 2n+1$ there is a single complex [[irreducible representation]] of complex [[dimension]] $2^{(d-1)/2}$. For instance for $d = 11$ one often writes this as $\mathbf{32}$. This is called the _Dirac spinor_ representation in this odd dimension.

For $d = 2n$, if $\{\Gamma^1, \cdots, \Gamma^n\}$ denote the generators of the [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl_{d-1,1}$ then there is the _chirality operator_

$$
  \Gamma^{d+1} \coloneqq \Gamma^1 \cdot \Gamma^2 \cdots \Gamma^d
$$

on the Dirac representation, whose [[eigenspaces]] induce its decomposition into the two chiral summands. 

The unique irreducible Dirac representation in the odd dimension $d+1$ is, as a complex vector space, the sum of the two chiral representations in dimension $d$, with the Clifford algebra represented by $\Gamma^1$ through $\Gamma^d$ acting diagonally on the two chiral representations, and the chirality operator $\Gamma^{d+1}$ in dimension $d$ acting on their sum, now being the representation of the $(d+1)$st Clifford algebra generator.



### Real representations (Majorana representations)
 {#RealIrreducibleSpinRepresentationInLorentzSignature}

One may ask in which dimensions $d$ the above complex representations admit a [[real structure]] 

Real spinor representations are also called _Majorana representations_, and an element of a real/Majorana spin representation is also called a _Majorana spinor_. On a Majorana representation $S$ there is a non-vanishing symmetric and $Spin(d-1,1)$-invariant [[bilinear form]] $S \otimes S \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, projectively unique if $S$ is [[irreducible representation|irreducible]]. This serves as the odd-odd [[Lie bracket]] in the [[super Lie algebra]] called the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of the ordinary [[Poincaré Lie algebra]] induced by $S$. This is "[[supersymmetry]]" in [[physics]].

The above irreducible complex representations admit a [[real structure]] for $d = 1,2,3 \, mod \, 8$. 
Therefore in dimension $d = 2 \, mod \, 8$ there exist _Majorana-Weyl spinor_ representations.

The above irreducible complex representations admit a [[quaternionic structure]] for $d = 5,6,7 \, mod \, 8$. 


Let $V$ be a quadratic vector space, def. \ref{QuadraticVectorSpace},
over the [[real numbers]] with [[bilinear form]] of Lorentzian [[signature]], hence $V = \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]] of some [[dimension]] $d$. 

The following table lists the irreducible real representations of $Spin(V)$ ([Freed 99, page 48](#Freed99)).

[[!include real irreducible spin representations -- table]]

Here $W$ is the 2-dimensional [[complex vector space]] on which the [[quaternions]] naturally act. 

+-- {: .num_remark #BilinearPairingForRealRepresentations}
###### Remark

The last column implies that in each dimension there exists a [[linear map]]

$$
  \Gamma \;\colon\; S^\ast \otimes S^\ast \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}
$$

which is 

1. symmetric;

1. $Spin(V)$-equivariant.

This allows to form the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] in each of these cases. See there and see _[Spinor bilinear forms](#SpinorBilinearForms)_ below for more.

=--


### Spinor bilinear forms
 {#SpinorBilinearForms}


Let $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ be a quadratic vector space, def. \ref{QuadraticVectorSpace}. For $p \in \mathbb{R}$ write $\wedge^p V$ for its $p$th skew-symmetrized [[tensor power]], regarded naturally as a [[representation]] of the [[spin group]] $Spin(V)$.

For $S_1, S_2 \in Rep(Spin(V))$ two [[irreducible representations]] of $Spin(V)$, we discuss here [[homomorphisms]] of representations (hence $k$-[[linear maps]] respecting the $Spin(V)$-[[action]]) of the form

$$
  S_1 \otimes S_2 \longrightarrow \wedge^p V
  \,.
$$

These appear notably in the following applications:

* for $p = 0$ symmetric bilinears $(-,-) \;\colon\; S \otimes S \longrightarrow k$ define a [[metric]] on the space of [[spinors]], also known as a _[[charge conjugation matrix]]_. This appears for instance in the [[Lagrangian]] for a [[spinor]] [[field (physics)|field]] $\psi$, which is of the form $\psi \mapsto (\psi, D \psi)$, for $D$ a [[Dirac operator]];

* for $p = 1$ symmetric bilinear $Spin(V)$-[[homomorphisms]] $\Gamma \;\colon\; S \otimes S \longrightarrow V$ constitutes the odd-odd [[Lie bracket]] in a [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of the a [[Poincaré Lie algebra]] by $S$.

* for $p=2$ symmetric bilineat spin pairings appear as the odd-odd bracket in a [[superconformal]] super Lie algebra;

* for $p \geq 2$ higher spin bilinears $S \otimes S \longrightarrow \wedge^p V$ appear in further [polyvector extensions](super+Poincare+Lie+algebra#PolyvectorExtensions).

##### Pairing to a vector in terms of the charge conjugation matrix
 {#PairingToVectorByChargeConjugationMatrix}

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In terms of a [[matrix]] representation with respect to a chosen
[[basis]] as in remark \ref{ChargeConjugationMatrix} the 
pairing of prop. \ref{BispinorialPairingToAVectorOverTheReals}
is given by the matrices $\Gamma^a = \{(\Gamma^a)^\alpha{}_\beta\}$
that represent the [[Clifford algebra]] by raising and lowering indices with the [[charge conjugation matrix]] of remark \ref{ChargeConjugationMatrix} (e.g [Freed 99 (3.5)](#Freed99)).

In such a notation if $\phi = (\phi^\alpha)$ denotes the component-vector of a spinor, then the result of "lowering its index" is given by acting with the metric in form of the [[charge conjugation matrix]]. The result is traditionally denoted

$$
  \overline{\phi} \coloneqq \phi^T C
$$

hence

$$
  \overline{\phi}_\alpha \coloneqq \phi^\beta C_{\beta \alpha}
  \,.
$$

This yields the component formula for the pairings to scalars and to vectors which is traditional in the physics literature as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    C(\phi,\psi) &= \phi^\alpha C_{\alpha \beta} \,\psi^\beta
    \\ 
    & = 
    \overline{\phi}_\alpha \psi^\alpha
    \\
    & = \overline{\phi} \psi
  \end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma^a(\phi, \psi)
    &= 
    \phi^\alpha \Gamma^a{}_{\alpha \beta} \psi^\beta 
    \\
    &= \phi^\alpha C_{\alpha \kappa} \Gamma^{a \kappa}{}_\beta \psi^\beta
    \\
    & = \phi^T C \Gamma^a \psi
    \\
    & \coloneqq 
    \overline{\phi} \Gamma^a \psi
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

(Recall that all this is here for _Majorana spinors_, as in the previous prop. \ref{BispinorialPairingToAVectorOverTheReals}.)

=--

This yields the component expressions for the bilinear pairings as familiar from the physics [[supersymmetry]] literature, for instance ([Polchinski 01, (B.2.1), (B.5.1)](#Polchinski01))

##### Counting numbers of supersymmetries
 {#CountingNumbersOfSupersymmetries}

A spinor bilinear pairing to a vector $\Gamma \;\colon\; S \otimes S \to V $ as above serves as the odd-odd bracket in a [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of $V$. Since this is also called a "[[supersymmetry]]" [[super Lie algebra]], with the spinors being the _supersymmetry generators_, the decomposition of $S$ into minimal/[[irreducible representations]] is also called the _number of supersymmetries_. This is traditionally denoted by a capital $N$ and in even dimensions and over the [[complex numbers]] it is traditional to write

$$
  N = (N_+, N_-)
$$

to indicate that there are $N_+$ copies of the irreducible $Spin(V)$-representation of one chirality, and $N_-$ of those of the other chirality (i.e. left and right handed _Weyl spinors_).

This counting however is more subtle over the real numbers (Majorana spinors) and the notation in this case (which happens to be the more important case) is not entirely consistent through the literature.

There is no issue in those dimensions in which the complex Weyl representation already admits a [[real structure]] itself, hence when there are _Majorana-Weyl spinors_. In this case one just counts them with $N_+$ and $N_-$ as in the case over the complex numbers.

However, in some dimensions it is only the [[direct sum]] of two Weyl spinor representations which carries a [[real structure]]. For instance for $d = 4$ and $d = 8$ in Lorentzian signature (see the [above table](#RealIrreducibleSpinRepresentationInLorentzSignature)) it is the complex representations $\mathbf{2} \oplus \mathbf{2}'$ and $\mathbf{16} \oplus \mathbf{16}'$, respectively, which carry a real structure. Hence the real representation underlying this parameterizes $N = 1$ supersymmetry in terms Majorana spinors, even though its complexification would be $N  = (1,1)$. 
See for instance ([Freed 99, p. 53](#Freed)).

Similarly in dimensions 5,6 and 7 mod 8, the minimal real representation is obatained from tensoring the complex spinors with the complex 2-dimensional canonical quaternionic representation $W$ (as in the [above table](#RealIrreducibleSpinRepresentationInLorentzSignature)). These are also called _symplectic Majorana_ representations. For instance in in 6d one typically speaks of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] to refer to that with a single "symplectic Majorana-Weyl" supersymmetry (e.g. [Figueroa-OFarrill, p. 9](#FigueroaOFarrill)), which might therefore be counted as $(1,0)$ real supersymmetric, but which involves two complex irreps and is hence often denoted counted as $(2,0)$.

### Expression of real representations via real normed division algebras
 {#ExpressionInTermsOfNormedDivisionAlgebras}

The real spinor representations in dimensions $3 \leq d \leq 11$ happen to have a particularly simple expression in terms of [[Hermitian forms]] over the four real [[normed division algebras]], the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$, [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, the [[quaternions]] $\mathbb{H}$ and the [[octonions]] $\mathbb{O}$. For more on this see also at _[[supersymmetry and division algebras]]_. We follow ([Baez-Huerta 09](#BaezHuerta09), [Baez-Huerta 10](#BaezHuerta10)).

Some notation:

* For $\mathbb{K}$ one of the four real [[normed division algebras]], write $(-)^\ast \colon \mathbb{K} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbb{K}^{op}$ for the conjugation anti-automorphism;

* the [[real part]] of an element $a \in \mathbb{K}$ is $Re(a) \coloneqq \tfrac{1}{2} (a + a^\ast)$;

* say that an $n \times n$ [[matrix]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{K}$, $A\in Mat_{n\times n}(\mathbb{K})$ is a [[hermitian matrix]] if the [[transpose matrix]] equals the conjugated matrix: $A^t = A^\ast$. Hence with $(-)^\dagger \coloneqq ((-)^t)^\ast$ this is $A = A^\dagger$, as usual;


* write $\tilde A \coloneqq A - (tr A) 1_{n\times n}$ for the matrix minus its [[trace]] times the identity matrix ("trace reversal").

$$

Its trace reversal is

$$
  \left\{
  \tilde{v}^+
  \coloneqq
  \left(
     \array{
        0 & 0
        \\
         0 & -1
     }
  \right)
  \,,
  \;
  \tilde v^-

  \left(

  \,,

  \tilde v^y

        0 & 1
        \\
        1 & 0

  \right)
  \right\}
$$

Hence the Minowski metric of prop. \ref{DeterminantGivesMinkowskiMetric} in this basis has the components

$$
  \eta 
     = 
  \left(
    \array{
      0 & -1 & 0
      \\
      -1 & 0 & 0
      \\
      0 & 0 & 2
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

As vector spaces $S_{\pm} = \mathbb{R}^2$.

The bilinear spinor pairing $\overline{(-)}(-) \colon S_+ \otimes S_- \to \mathbb{R}$ is given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     \overline{\psi}\phi  
     &= \psi^t \cdot \phi
     \\
     & = \psi_1  \phi_1 + \psi_2 \phi_2
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The spinor pairing $S_+ \otimes S_+ \otimes V^\ast \to \mathbb{R}$
from prop. \ref{RealSpinorPairingsViaDivisionAlg} is given on an $A = A_+ v^+ + A_- v^- + A_y v^y $ ($A_+, A_-, A_y \in \mathbb{R}$) 
by the components

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta(\overline{\psi}\Gamma\phi,A)
    &=
    \psi^t \cdot A \cdot \phi
    \\
    & = 
    \psi_1 \phi_1 A_+
    + 
    \psi_2 \phi_2 A_-
    +
    (\psi_1 \phi_2 + \psi_2 \phi_1) A_y
  \end{aligned}
$$

and $S_- \otimes S_- \otimes V^\ast \to \mathbb{R}$ is given by the components

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta(\overline{\psi}\Gamma\phi,A)
    &=
    \psi^t \cdot \tilde A \cdot \phi
    \\
    &= 
    -\psi_1 \phi_1 A_+
    - 
    \psi_2 \phi_2 A_-
    +
    (\psi_1 \phi_2 + \psi_2 \phi_1) A_y    
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

and so, in view of the above metric components, in terms of dual bases $\{\psi^i\}$ this is

$$
  \mu = 
  - \psi^1 \otimes \psi^1 \otimes A_-
  - \psi^2 \otimes \psi^2 \otimes A_+
  +
  \frac{1}{2} (\psi^1 \otimes \psi^2 \oplus \psi^2 \otimes\psi^1) \otimes A_y
$$



So there is in particular the 2-dimensional space of [[isomorphisms]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] [[super translation Lie algebras]] 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{2,1|\mathbf{2}}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{2,1|\bar\mathbf{2}}
$$

(not though of the corresponding [[super Poincaré Lie algebras]], because for them the difference in the Spin-representation does matter) spanned by

$$
  (\theta_1,\theta_2, \vec e) \mapsto (\theta_1, -\theta_2, -\vec e)
$$

and by

$$
  (\theta_1,\theta_2, \vec e) \mapsto (-\theta_1, \theta_2, -\vec e)
  \,.
$$

Hence there is a 1-dimensional space of non-trivial [[automorphism]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{2,1|\mathbf{2}}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{2,1|\mathbf{2}}
$$

spanned by

$$
  (\theta_1,\theta_2, \vec e) \mapsto (-\theta_1, -\theta_2, \vec e)
  \,.

###### Proposition

The map $\Gamma$ in def. \ref{CliffordAlgebraInTermsOfNormedDivisionAlgebraOneDimHigher} gives a [[representation]] of the [[Clifford algebra]] of 

1. $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$;

1. $\mathbb{R}^{4,1}$ for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{C}$;

1. $\mathbb{R}^{6,1}$ for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{H}$;

1. $\mathbb{R}^{10,1}$ for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{O}$.

Under restriction along $Spin(n+2,1) \hookrightarrow Cl(n+2,1)$ this is isomorphic to

1. for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ the Majorana representation of $Spin(3,1)$ on $S$;

1. for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{C}$ the Dirac representation of $Spin(4,1)$ on $S$;

1. for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{H}$ the Dirac representation of $Spin(6,1)$ on $S$;

1. for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{O}$ the Majorana representation of $Spin(10,1)$ on $S$.
