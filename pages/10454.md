## Idea

Theorems observed by Harding, Döring and Hamhalter say that under some conditions the [[Jordan algebra]] structure of a [[C*-algebra]] is effectively captured by its [[poset of commutative subalgebras]].

Via the [[Alfsen-Shultz theorem]], which states that two [[C*-algebra]] have the same [[states]] precisely if they are isomorphic as [[Jordan algebras]], this is related to [[Gleason's theorem]], which says that states on an [[algebra of bounded operators]] are determined by their restriction to commutative subalgebras (if the underlying Hilbert space has dimenion $\gt 2$).

## Statements

For $A$ an [[associative algebra]] write $A_J$ for its corresponding [[Jordan algebra]], where the commutative product $\circ : A_J \otimes A_J \to A_J$ is the symmetrization of the product in $A$: $a \circ b = \frac{1}{2}(a b + b a)$.

###### Observation

There exist [[von Neumann algebras]] $A$, $B$ such that there exists a [[Jordan algebra]] isomorphism $A_J \to B_J$ but not an algebra isomorphism $A \to B$.

###### Proof

By 

* [[Alain Connes]], _A factor not anti-isomorphic to itself_, Annals of Mathematics, 101 (1975), no. 3, 536–554. ([JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1970940))

there is a [[von Neumann algebra factor]] $A$ with no algebra isomorphism to its opposite algebra $A^{op}$. But clearly $A_J \simeq (A^{op})_J$.

###### Proposition

Let $A, B$ be [[von Neumann algebra]]s without a type $I_2$-[[von Neumann algebra factor]]-summand and let $ComSub(A)$, $ComSub(B)$ be their posets of [[commutative C-star-algebra|commutative]] sub-von Neumann algebras. 

Then every [[isomorphism]] $ComSub(A) \to ComSub(B)$ of [[poset]]s comes from a unique [[Jordan algebra]] isomorphism $A_J \to B_J$.

This is the theorem in ([Harding-Döring 10](#HardingDoering)).

There is a generalization of this theorem to more general [[C-star algebras]] in ([Hamhalter 11](#Hamhalter)).

###### Remark

This is related to the [[Alfsen-Shultz theorem]], which says that two $C^*$-algebras have the 
same [[state on an operator algebra|states]] precisely if they are Jordan-isomorphic.
