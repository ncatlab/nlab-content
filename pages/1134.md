## Idea

A [[supermanifold]] is a [[space]] locally modeled on [[Cartesian space]]s and [[superpoint]]s.

There are different approaches to the definition and theory of supermanifolds in the literature. The definition 

* [As locally ringed spaces](#AsLocallyRingedSpace)

is popular. The definition 

* [As manifolds over superpoints](#OverSuperpoints)

has been argued to have advantages, see also the references at [[super ∞-groupoid]].

## As locally ringed spaces
 {#AsLocallyRingedSpace}

We discuss a description of supermanifolds that goes back to 
([BerezinLeites](BerezinLeites)).

### Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #SupermanifoldLocallyRingedSpace}
###### Definition

A **supermanifold** $X$ of dimension $p|q$ is a
[[ringed space]] $(|X|, O_X)$ where

* the [[topological space]] $|X|$ is [[second countable space]], [[Hausdorff space]],

* $O_X$ is a [[sheaf]] of commutative [[super algebra]]s that is locally on small enough open subsets $U \subset |X|$ isomorphic to one of the form $C^\infty(U) \otimes \wedge^\bullet \mathbb{R}^q$.

A [[morphism]] of supermanifolds is a morphism of [[ringed space]]s (...).

=--

Forgetting the graded part by projecting out the nilpotent ideal in $O_X$ yields the underlying ordinary smooth [[manifold]] $X_{red}$.

One just writes $C^\infty(X)$ for the [[super algebra]] $O_X(X)$ of global sections.

With the obvious morphisms of [[ringed space]] this forms the [[category]] [[SDiff]] of supermanifolds.

### Examples

**Example** For $E \to X$ a smooth finite-rank [[vector bundle]] the [[manifold]] $X$ equipped with the [[Grassmann algebra]] over $C^\infty(X)$ of the sections  of the dual bundle

$$
  O_X(U) := \Gamma (\wedge^\bullet(E^*))
$$

is a supermanifold. This is usually denoted by $\Pi E$.

**Example** In particular, let $\mathbb{R}^{p+q} \to \mathbb{R}^p$ be the trivial rank $q$ [[vector bundle]] on $\mathbb{R}^p$ then one writes

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{p|q} := \Pi (\mathbb{R}^{p+q} \to \mathbb{R}^p)
$$

for the corresponding supermanifold.


### Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(Batchelor's theorem)**

Every supermanifold is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to one of the form $\Pi E$ where $E$ is an ordinary smooth [[vector bundle]].

=--

**Warning** Still, the category of supermanifolds is far from being [[equivalence|equivalent]] to that of [[vector bundle]]s because a morphism of vector bundles translates to a morphism of supermanifolds that is strictly homogeneous in degrees, while a general morphism of supermanifolds need not be of this form.

But we have the following useful characterization of morphisms of supermanifolds:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

* There is a natural bijection

  $$
    SDiff(X,Y) \simeq SAlgebras(C^\infty(Y), C^\infty(Y)),
  $$

  so the contravariant embedding of supermanifolds into superalgebra is a [[full and faithful functor]].

* Composition with the standard coordinate functions on $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ yields an [[isomorphism]]

  $$
    SDiff(X, \mathbb{R}^{p|q})
    \simeq
    (C^\infty(X)^{ev} \times \cdots p times \cdots 
    \times C^\infty(X)^{ev})
    \times
    (C^\infty(X)^{odd} \times \cdots q times \cdots 
    \times C^\infty(X)^{odd}).
  $$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement is a direct extension of the classical fact that the contravariant embedding of ordinary [[smooth manifold]]s into algebras $X \mapsto C^\infty(X)$ is a [[full and faithful functor]].

## As manifolds modeled on Grassman algebras
 {#ModeledOnGrassmannAlgebra}

We discuss a desription of supermanifolds that goes back to 
([deWitt](#deWitt)) and ([Rogers](#Rogers)).

(...)

## As manifolds over the base topos on superpoints
 {#OverSuperpoints}

Let $SuperPoint$ be the [[category]] of [[superpoint]]s. And $Sh(SuperPoint) = PSh(SuperPoint)$ its [[presheaf topos]].

We discuss a definition of supermanifolds that characterizes them, roughly,  as manifolds over this [[base topos]]. See ([Sachse](#Sachse)) and the references at [[super ∞-groupoid]].


### Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Let 

$$
  SuperSet := Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

be the [[sheaf topos]] over [[superpoint]]s. Let

$$
  \mathbb{K} \in SuperSet
$$

be the canomnical commutative ring object, as discussed at [[superalgebra]].

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **superdomain** is an open subfunctor (...) of a [[locally convex vector space|locally convex]] $\mathbb{K}$-module.

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, def. 4.6](#Sachse)). 

We now want to describe supermanifolds as [[manifold]]s in $SuperSet$ modeled on superdomains.

Write [[SmoothMfd]] for the [[category]] of ordinary [[smooth manifold]]s.

+-- {: .num_defn #SupermanifoldOverSuperpoint}
###### Definition

A _supermanifold_ is a functor $X : SuperPoint^{op} \to SmoothMfd$ equipped with an equivalence class of [supersmooth atlases](#).

A [[morphism]] of supermanifolds is a [[natural transformation]] $f : X \to X'$, such that for each pair of [[chart]]s $u : U \to X$ and $u' : U' \to X'$ the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    U \times_{X'} U' &&\stackrel{p'}{\to}&& U'
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_1}}\downarrow & & && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{u'}}
    \\
    U &\stackrel{u}{\to}& X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& X'
  }
$$

can be equipped with the structture of a [Banach superdomain](#) such that $p_1$ and $p_2$ are supersmooth (...)

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, def. 4.13, 4.14](#Sachse)).

### Properties

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The categories of supermanifolds defined as locally ringed spaces, 
def. \ref{SupermanifoldLocallyRingedSpace} and as manifolds over superpoints,
def. \ref{SupermanifoldOverSuperpoint} are 
[[equivalence of categories|equivalent]].

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, theorem 5.1](#Sachse)). See section 5.2 there for a discussion of the relation to the [deWitt-definition](#ModeledOnGrassmannAlgebra).

There are many books in [[physics]] on [[supersymmetry]] (most well known is by Wess and Barger from 1992), but they emphasise more on the [[supersymmetry algebra]]s rather than on (the superspace and) _supermanifolds_. They should therefore rather be listed under entry [[supersymmetry]].
