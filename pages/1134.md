There are many books in physics on supersymmetry (most well known is by Wess and Barger from 1992), but they emphasise more on the supersymmetry algebras rather than on (the superspace and) _supermanifolds_. They should therefore rather be listed under entry [[supersymmetry]]. One should also note that there are two different definitions of a supermanifold which are not equivalent (some examples intersect but not all); they are sometimes  connected and even named according to the main proponents of the two approaches: Leites (via sheaves) and de Witt (via supernumbers).
