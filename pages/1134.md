#Definition#

A **supermanifold** $X$ of dimension $p|q$ is a
[[ringed space]] $(|X|, O_X)$ where

* the [[topological space]] $|X|$ is [[second countable space]], [[Hausdorff space]],

* $O_X$ is a [[sheaf]] of commutative [[super algebra]]s that is locally on small enough open subsets $U \subset |X|$ isomorphic to one of the form $C^\infty(U) \otimes \wedge^\bullet \mathbb{R}^q$.

Forgetting the graded part by projecting out the nilpotent ideal in $O_X$ yields the underlying ordinary smooth [[manifold]] $X_{red}$.

One just writes $C^\infty(X)$ for the [[super algebra]] $O_X(X)$ of global sections.

With the obvious morphisms of [[ringed space]] this forms the [[category]] [[SDiff]] of supermanifolds.

#Examples#

**Example** For $E \to X$ a smooth finite-rank [[vector bundle]] the [[manifold]] $X$ equipped with the [[Grassmann algebra]] over $C^\infty(X)$ of the sections  of the dual bundle

$$
  O_X(U) := \Gamma (\wedge^\bullet(E^*))
$$

is a supermanifold. This is usually denoted by $\Pi E$.

**Example** In particular, let $\mathbb{R}^{p+q} \to \mathbb{R}^p$ be the trivial rank $q$ [[vector bundle]] on $\mathbb{R}^p$ then one writes

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{p|q} := \Pi (\mathbb{R}^{p+q} \to \mathbb{R}^p)
$$

for the corresponding supermanifold.


#Properties#

**Theorem** (Batchelor's theorem) Every supermanifold is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to one of the form $\Pi E$ where $E$ is an ordinary smooth [[vector bundle]].

**Warning** Still, the category of supermanifolds is far from being [[equivalence|equivalent]] to that of [[vector bundle]]s because a morphism of vector bundles translates to a morphism of supermanifolds that is strictly homogeneous in degrees, while a general morphism of supermanifolds need not be of this form.

But we have the following useful characterization of morphisms of supermanifolds:

**Theorem**

* There is a natural bijection

  $$
    SDiff(X,Y) \simeq SAlgebras(C^\infty(Y), C^\infty(Y)),
  $$

  so the contravariant embedding of supermanifolds into superalgebra is a [[full and faithful functor]].

* Composition with the standard coordinate functions on $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ yields an [[isomorphism]]

  $$
    SDiff(X, \mathbb{R}^{p|q})
    \simeq
    (C^\infty(X)^{ev} \times \cdots p times \cdots 
    \times C^\infty(X)^{ev})
    \times
    (C^\infty(X)^{odd} \times \cdots q times \cdots 
    \times C^\infty(X)^{odd}).
  $$

**Proof**

The first statement is a direct extension of the classical fact that the contravariant embedding of ordinary smooth [[manifold]]s into algebras $X \mapsto C^\infty(X)$ is a [[full and faithful functor]].

There are many books in [[physics]] on [[supersymmetry]] (most well known is by Wess and Barger from 1992), but they emphasise more on the [[supersymmetry algebra]]s rather than on (the superspace and) _supermanifolds_. They should therefore rather be listed under entry [[supersymmetry]]. One should also note that there are two different definitions of a supermanifold which are not equivalent (some examples intersect but not all); they are sometimes  connected and even named according to the main proponents of the two approaches: Leites (via [[sheaf|sheaves]]) and de Witt (via [[supernumber]]s).
