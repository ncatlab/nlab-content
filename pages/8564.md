## Definition

A [[ring]] $R$ is a **principal ideal domain** if

1. it is an [[integral domain]];

1. every [[ideal]] in $R$ is a [[principal ideal]]. 

Often _pid_ is used as an abbreviation of "principal ideal domain". 

## Examples

* any [[field]]

* the ring of [[integers]]

* a [[polynomial ring]] with [[coefficients]] in a field

###### Theorem 
If $F$ is a [[free module]] over a pid $R$, then any [[submodule]] $M$ of $F$ is also free. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
By freeness of $F$, there exists an isomorphism $F \cong \sum_{j \in J} R_j$, a [[coproduct]] of copies $R_j$ of $R$ (as a module over the ring $R$) indexed over a set $J$, which we assume [[well-ordering|well-ordered]] using the [[axiom of choice]]. Define submodules of $F$: 

$$F_{\leq j} \coloneqq \sum_{i \leq j} R_i, \qquad F_{\lt j} \coloneqq \sum_{i \lt j} R_i\,.$$ 

Any element of $M \cap F_{\leq j}$ can be written uniquely as $(x, r)$ where $x \in F_{\lt j}$ and $r \in R_j$. Define a [[homomorphism]]

$$p_j \colon M \cap F_{\leq j} \to R$$ 

by $p_j((x, r)) = r$. The [[kernel]] of $p_j$ is $M \cap F_{\lt j}$, and we have an [[exact sequence]]

$$0 \to M \cap F_{\lt j} \to M \cap F_{\leq j} \to \im p_j \to 0$$ 

where $\im p_j$ is a submodule (i.e., an [[ideal]]) of $R$, hence generated by a single element $r_j$. Let $K \subseteq J$ consist of those $j$ such that $r_j \neq 0$, and for $k \in K$, choose $m_k$ such that $p_k(m_k) = r_k$. We claim that $\{m_k: k \in K\}$ forms a [[basis]] for $M$. 

First we prove [[linear independence]] of $\{m_k\}$. Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i m_{k_i} = 0$, with $k_1 \lt k_2 \lt \ldots \lt k_n$. Applying $p_{k_n}$, we get $a_n p_{k_n}(m_{k_n}) = a_n r_{k_n} = 0$. Since $r_{k_n} \neq 0$, we have $a_n = 0$ (since we are working over a domain). The assertion now follows by [[induction]].  

Now we prove that the $m_k$ generate $M$. Assume otherwise, and let $j \in J$ be the least $j$ such that some $m \in M \cap F_{\leq j}$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the $m_k$, for $k \in K$. If $j \notin K$, then $m \in M \cap F_{\lt j}$, so that $m \in M \cap F_{\leq i}$ for some $i \lt j$, but this contradicts minimality of $j$. Therefore $j \in K$. Now, we have $p_j(m) = r \cdot r_j$ for some $r$; put $m' = m - r m_j$. Clearly 

$$p_j(m') = p_j(m) - r \cdot p_j(m_j) = 0$$ 

and so $m' \in M \cap F_{\lt j}$. Thus $m' \in M \cap F_{\leq i}$ for some $i \lt j$. At the same time, $m'$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the $m_k$; again, this contradicts minimality of $j$. Thus the $m_k$ generate $M$, as claimed.

Since the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ for a pid, and [[abelian groups]] are the same as $\mathbb{Z}$-[[modules]], we have

###### Corollary 
**(Dedekind)** 
A [[subgroup]] of a [[free abelian group]] is also free abelian.

###### Remark

The analog of this statement for possibly non-abelian [[groups]] is the _[[Nielsen-Schreier theorem]]_.

Also, since [[projective modules]] are [[retracts]] of free modules, we have

###### Corollary 
Projective modules over a pid are free. In particular, submodules of projective modules are projective.
