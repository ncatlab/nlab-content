A **posite** (or **(0,1)-site**) is a [[poset]] (or more generally a [[preordered set]]) equipped with a [[Grothendieck topology]] or a [[coverage]].  (The name is a portmanteau/pun on "poset" and [[site]].)

The definition of coverage simplifies a little in this case: thus we may consider a posite to be simply a poset $P$ equipped with, for each $x\in P$, a collection of covering families $(y_i)_i$ where each $y_i\le x$, such that if $(y_i)$ covers $x$ and $z\le x$, then there is a covering $(w_j)$ of $z$ such that for each $j$ there is an $i$ with $w_j \le y_i$.

The [[topos of sheaves]] on any posite is a [[localic topos]].  We may describe the relevant [[locale]] explicitly as follows: the elements of its [[frame]] (i.e. its "open subsets") are the [[lower subsets]] of $F\subseteq P$ satisfying the closure property that if $(y_i)$ covers $x$ and each $y_i\in F$, then $x\in F$ also.  Such an $F$ is sometimes called an **ideal** for the coverage on $P$.

[[David Roberts]]: Does this include the double negation topology used in the sheaf-theoretic approach to forcing?

[[Mike Shulman]]: Yes!  Classical [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[forcing]] is done exclusively on posites.  One "reason" for this is explained in a paper of Peter Freyd called something like "all topoi are localic, or why permutation models prevail."
