# Reflection of limits

## Idea

A [[functor]] is said to _reflect_ [[limits]] of a given shape if a [[cone]] is limiting whenever its image under $F$ is.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_prop #ReflectedLimit}
###### Definition

Let $F\colon C\to D$ be a [[functor]] and $J\colon I\to C$ a [[diagram]].  We say that $F$ **reflects** limits of $J$ if whenever we have a [[cone]] $\eta\colon const^I_x \to J$ over $J$ in $C$ such that $F(\eta)$ is a [[limit]] of $F\circ J$ in $D$, then $\eta$ was already a limit of $J$ in $C$.

=--

Of course, a functor $F$ reflects a colimit if $F^{op}$ reflects the corresponding limit.

If $F$ reflects all limits or colimits of a given type (i.e. over a given category $I$), we simply say that $F$ reflects that sort of limit (e.g. $F$ reflects products, $F$ reflects equalizers, etc.).

A functor which both reflects *and* preserves limits, and such that limits exist in its domain whenever they do in its codomain, is said to [[created limit|create]] them.

###### Remark

Reflection of limits is distinct from [[preservation of limits]], although there are relationships, e.g prop. \ref{ConservativeFunctors}.

###### Proposition

A [[conservative functor]] reflects any limits which exist in its domain and that it [[preserved limit|preserves]].  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $J$ in def. \ref{ReflectedLimit} has some limit $\theta$ which is preserved by $F$, then there is a unique induced map $\eta\to\theta$ by the universal property of a limit, which becomes an isomorphism in $D$ since $F(\eta)$ and $F(\theta)$ are both limits of $F\circ J$; hence if $F$ is conservative then it must already have been an isomorphism in $C$, and so $\eta$ was already also a limit of $J$.

###### Proposition

A [[faithful functor]] reflects [[epimorphisms]] and [[monomorphisms]].

(The simple proof is spelled out for instance at _[[epimorphism]]_.)
