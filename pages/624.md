## Idea

A (left/right) _dual_ to an [[object]] in a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[left adjoint|left]]/[[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint]] to the object regarded as a [[morphism]] in the [[delooping]] [[2-category]] $\mathbf{B}\mathcal{C}$. If a dual exists, the object is called _dualizable_.


Being *dualizable* may often be thought of as a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] notion of *finiteness* for [[objects]] in a [[monoidal category]].  For instance, a [[vector space]] is dualizable in [[Vect]] with its standard [[tensor product]] just when it has [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]]; and a [[spectrum]] is dualizable in the [[stable homotopy category]] with its [[smash product]] just when it is a [[finite spectrum]].

A more precise intuition is that an object is dualizable if its "size" is no larger than the "additivity" of the monoidal category.  Since [[Vect]] and the stable homotopy category are finitely [[additive category|additive]], but not infinitely so, dualizability there is a notion of finiteness.  This is the case for many monoidal categories in which one considers dualizability.  However, in a monoidal category which is not additive at all, such as [[Set]] (or any cartesian monoidal category), only the terminal object is dualizable---whereas in an "infinitely additive" monoidal category such as [[Rel]] or [[SupLat]], many "infinite" objects are dualizable.  (In $Rel$, *all* objects are dualizable.)

###### Warning
There are other notions of "dual object", distinct from this one. See for example [[dual object in a closed category]], and also the discussion at [[category with duals]].

## In a monoidal category

### Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #DualizableObject}
###### Definition

An object $A$ in a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is **dualizable** if it has an [[adjunction|adjoint]] when regarded as a [[morphism]] in the one-object [[delooping]] [[bicategory]] $\mathbf{B}C$ corresponding to $C$.  Its adjoint in $\mathbf{B}C$ is called its **dual** in $C$ and often written as $A^*$.

=--

If $C$ is [[braided monoidal category|braided]] then left and right adjoints in $\mathbf{B}C$ are equivalent; otherwise one speaks of $A$ being **left dualizable** or **right dualizable**.  

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Unfortunately, conventions on left and right vary and sometimes contradict their use for adjoints.  A common convention is that a *right dual* of $A$ is an object $A^*$ equipped with a **[[unit of an adjunction|unit]]** (or *[[coevaluation]]*)
$$i: I \to A \otimes A^* $$
and **counit** (or *[[evaluation]]*)
$$e : A^* \otimes A \to I $$
satisfying the 'triangle identities' familiar from the concept of [[adjunction]].  With this convention, if $\otimes$ in $C$ is interpreted as composition in $\mathbf{B} C$ in [[diagrammatic order]], then right duals in $C$ are the same as right adjoints in $\mathbf{B}C$ --- whereas if $\otimes$ in $C$ is interpreted as composition in $\mathbf{B} C$ in classical 'Leibnizian' order, then right duals in $C$ are the same as *left* adjoints in $\mathbf{B} C$.

Of course, in a [[symmetric monoidal category]], there is no difference between left and right duals.

+-- {: .num_defn #InvertibleObject}
###### Definition

A dualizable object $A$, def. \ref{DualizableObject}, for which the structure unit/counit maps between $A \otimes A^\ast$ and the [[unit object]] are [[isomorphisms]] is called an _[[invertible object]]_.


=--

+-- {: .num_defn #RigidAndCompactClosed}
###### Definition

If every object of $C$ has a left and right dual, then $C$ is called a [[rigid monoidal category]] or an [[autonomous monoidal category]].  If moreover it is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]], it is called a [[compact closed category]].  

=--

See [[category with duals]] for more discussion.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ between two dualizable objects in a [[symmetric monoidal category]], the corresponding [[dual morphism]] 

$$
  f^\ast \colon Y^\ast \to X^\ast
$$

is the one obtained by $f$ by composing the duality unit, the counit and the [[braiding]]...

### Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over a field $k$, and let $V^* = Hom(V,k)$ be its usual [[dual vector space]].  We can define $\varepsilon\colon V^* \otimes V \to k$ to be the obvious pairing.  If we also choose a finite basis $\{v_i\}$ of $V$, and let $\{v_i^*\}$ be the [[dual basis]] of $V^*$, then we can define $\eta\colon k \to V\otimes V^*$ by sending $1$ to $\sum_i v_i \otimes v_i^*$.  It is easy to check the triangle identities, so $V^*$ is a dual of $V$ in $Vect_k$.

###### Example

Let $M$ be a finite-dimensional [[manifold]], choose an embedding $M\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$, and let $Th(N X)$ be the [[Thom spectrum]] of the [[normal bundle]] of this embedding.  Then the [[Thom collapse]] map defines an $\eta$ which exhibits $Th(N X)$ as a dual of $\Sigma_+^\infty M$ in the [[stable homotopy category]].  This is a version of [[Spanier-Whitehead duality]].

###### Example

A [[C*-algebra]] is a [[Poincaré duality algebra]]
if it is a dualizable object in the  [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[KK-theory|KK]] with dual its [[opposite algebra]].

### Properties

Dualizable objects support a good abstract notion of [[trace]]. (...)



## In a closed category

In a [[closed category]] $(\mathcal{C}, [-,-], 1)$ the dual to an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is defined to be the [[internal hom]] into the [[unit object]]

$$
  \mathbb{D}X \coloneqq [X,1]
  \,.
$$

## In a closed monoidal category

In a [[closed monoidal category]] $\mathbb{D}X$ is also called the _weak dual_ of $X$ (e.g. [Becker-Gottlieb, p. 5](#BeckerGottlieb)), to contrast with the monoidal dual as above, which would then be called the _strong dual_ . If the induced morphism $X \to \mathbb{D}\mathbb{D}X$ is an [[equivalence]] this weak dual is called a _reflexive weak dual_.

If $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[compact closed category]], def. \ref{RigidAndCompactClosed}, then the weak dual $\mathbb{D}X$ is also [[generalized the|the]] strong dual object $X^\ast$ to $X$ in the above monoidal sense. Here dualization exhibits $\mathcal{C}$ as a [[star-autonomous category]] ($\mathbb{D}(-) = (-)^\ast$ is the star-operation)


## In a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] $C$ is called **dualizable** if it is so as an object in the ordinary [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[homotopy category]] $Ho(C)$.

=--

This appears as ([Lurie, def. 2.3.5](#Lurie)).


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that an object in $C$ is dualizable if there exists unit and counit 1-morphism that satisfy the [[triangle identity]] up to [[homotopy]]. The definition does not demand that this homotopy is [[coherent]] (that it satisfies itself higher order relations up to higher order [[k-morphism]]s).

If the structure morphisms of the adjunction of a dualizable object _have_ themselves all adjoints, then the object is called a [[fully dualizable object]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

As before, we may equivalently state this after [[delooping]] the monoidal structure and passing to the $(\infty,n+1)$-category $\mathbf{B}C$. Then $C$ has duals for objects precisely if $\mathbf{B}C$ has all adjoints.
