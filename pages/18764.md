## Idea

A _[[partial differential equation]]_ (PDE) is _Green hyperbolic_ ([Khavkine 14, def. 2.2](#Khavkine14)) if it behaves like a [[normally hyperbolic differential equation]] on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] in that it has unique [[advanced and retarded Green functions]].

_Duhamelâ€™s principle_ essentially establishes the equivalence between [[hyperbolic  differential equations]] with a well-posed [[Cauchy problem]] and Green hyperbolic systems. ([Khavkine 14, p. 12](#Khavkine14))

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[Lorentzian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, or more generally a [[conal manifold]] with [[conal causal structure]].
 
$$
  \array{
    E 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$ 

be a [[smooth vector bundle]]. Write

$$
  \tilde E^\ast
     \;\coloneqq\; 
   E^\ast \otimes_\Sigma \wedge_\Sigma^{p+1} T^\ast \Sigma
$$

for the _[[density|densitized]] [[dual vector bundle]]_, hence the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] of the [[dual vector bundle]] with the [[differential n-form]]-bundle.

###### Definition
**(compactly sourced causal support)

Given a [[vector bundle]] $E \overset{}{\to} \Sigma$ over a manifold $\Sigma$ with [[conal causal structure|causal structure]]


Write $\Gamma_{\Sigma}(-)$ for [[space of sections|spaces of smooth sections]], and write

    \\
    \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(-) & \text{compactly source causal support}
  }
$$ 

for the [[linear subspaces]] on those smooth sections whose [[support]] is 
1) inside a [[compact subset]], 2) inside the [[closed future cone]]/[[closed past cone]], respectively of a [[compact subset]], 3) inside the [[closed causal cone]] of a [[compact subset]] (spacelike compact support).

###### Definition
**([[advanced and retarded Green functions]] and [[causal Green function]])**

Given a Green-hyperbolic differential operator $P$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) there are [[linear maps]]

$$
  \mathrm{G}_\pm
    \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,\pm cp}(\tilde E^\ast)
    \longrightarrow
  \Gamma_{\Sigma, \pm cp}(E)
$$

between spaces of causally source future/past support (def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport})
such that the unique solution to $P \Phi_\pm = \tilde \alpha^\ast$ is given by 

$$
  \Phi_\pm = \mathrm{G}_\pm(\tilde \alpha^\ast)
  \,.
$$

These $\mathrm{G}_{\pm}$ are called the _[[advanced and retarded Green functions]]_ for $P$.

The difference

$$
  \mathrm{G} \coloneqq \mathrm{G}_+ - \mathrm{G}_-
$$

is called the _[[causal Green function]]_ for $P$.

###### Proposition
**([[exact sequence]] of Green hyperbolic system)**


Let $\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a Green hyperbolic differential operator (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) with [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}). Then the sequence 

$$
  0 
    \to  
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E)
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)
    \overset{G}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E)
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast)
     \to
  0
$$

of these operators restricted to compact or spatially compact support as indicated (def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport})
is an [[exact sequence]].

In particular this means that there is a [[linear isomorphism]] betwen the space $ker_{scp}(P)$ of spatially compact solutions to the differential equation and the [[quotient space]] of the [[compact support|compactly supported]] dual sections by the [[image]] of $P$:

$$
  \label{SolutionSpaceIsomorphiicToQuotientByImP}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)/im(P)
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\phantom{A}\mathrm{G}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  ker_{scp}(P)
  \,.
$$

([Khavkine 14, prop. 2.1](#Khavkine14))


Suppose all [[spaces of sections]] here are equipped with suitable [[topological vector space]] structure. Then it follows:

+-- {: .num_cor #DistributionsOnSolutionSpaceAreTheGeneralizedPDESolutions}
###### Corollary
**(distributions on solution space are the generalized PDE solutions)##

Let $\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a Green hyperbolic differential operator (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}).

A [[continuous linear functional]] on the solution space

$$
  u_{sol} \in \left(ker_{scp}(P)\right)^\ast
$$

is equivalently a [[distribution]] on dual sections

$$
  u \in \left( \Gamma_{cp}(\tilde E^\ast)\right)^\ast
$$

which is a [[generalized solution]] to the differential equation

$$
  P u = 0
  \,,
$$

and this [[linear isomorphism]] is given by pullback along the [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{AdvancedAndRetardedGreenFuntioons}):

$$
  \left(ker_{scp}(P)\right)^\ast
     \underoverset{\simeq}{(-)\circ \mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow}
   \left\{
     u \in \left( \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)\right)^\ast
     \,\vert\,
     P u = 0
   \right\}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof idea

On the level of [[vector spaces]], ignoring the topology, this is just the statement of the linear isomorphism (eq:SolutionSpaceIsomorphiicToQuotientByImP) from prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem} under passing to [[dual vector spaces]].

Hence it remains to be seen that the statement remains true for [[topological vector spaces]] and [[continuous linear functionals]] between these. For that we need (..?..) that the subspace inclusion $im(P) \hookrightarrow \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)$ is a [[closed subspace]]. But this follows again by the exactness of the sequence in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}, since that image is also a kernel.
