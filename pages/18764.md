## Idea

A _[[partial differential equation]]_ (PDE) is _Green hyperbolic_ ([B&#228;r 14, def. 3.2](#Baer14), [Khavkine 14, def. 2.2](#Khavkine14)) if it behaves like a [[normally hyperbolic differential equation]] on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] in that it has unique [[advanced and retarded Green functions]].

_Duhamel&#8217;s principle_ essentially establishes the equivalence between [[hyperbolic  differential equations]] with a well-posed [[Cauchy problem]] and Green hyperbolic systems. ([Khavkine 14, p. 12](#Khavkine14))

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[Lorentzian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, or more generally a [[conal manifold]] with [[conal causal structure]].
 
$$
  \array{
    E

$$

   E^\ast \otimes_\Sigma \wedge_\Sigma^{p+1} T^\ast \Sigma
$$

for the _[[density|densitized]] [[dual vector bundle]]_, hence the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] of the [[dual vector bundle]] with the [[differential n-form]]-bundle.

Given a [[vector bundle]] $E \overset{}{\to} \Sigma$ over a manifold $\Sigma$ with [[conal causal structure|causal structure]]

Write $\Gamma_{\Sigma}(-)$ for [[space of sections|spaces of smooth sections]], and write

This makes $\Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ a [[Fréchet space|Fréchet]] [[topological vector space]].

For $K \subset \Sigma$ any [[closed subset]] then the sub-space of sections

Finally, the [[vector spaces]] of smooth sections with prescribed causal support (def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport})

Let $\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a [[Green hyperbolic differential operator]] (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) with [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}). Then the sequences

of these operators restricted to functions with causally restricted supports as indicated (def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport})
are [[exact sequence]]s of [[topological vector spaces]] and continuous [[linear maps]] between them.

Under passing to [[dual spaces]] and using the isomorphisms of spaces of distributional sections (def. \ref{DistributionalSections}) from prop. \ref{DistributionsWithCausalSupports} this yields the following dual [[exact sequence]] of [[topological vector spaces]] and continuous [[linear maps]] between them:

$$

In particular this means that there is a [[linear isomorphism]] between the space $ker_{scp}(P)$ of spatially compact solutions to the differential equation and the [[quotient space]] of the [[compact support|compactly supported]] dual sections by the [[image]] of $P$:

The following proof is a slight refinement of ([Khavkine 14, prop. 2.1](#Khavkine14)). The refinement consists of reducing the check of exactness to the construction of a contracting homotopy of the complex into itself (cf. the answer to [MO208985](https://mathoverflow.net/a/209024), where this refinement has appeared in a simplified context).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\Sigma_p^-, \Sigma_p^+ \subset \Sigma$ be two Cauchy surfaces, with $\Sigma_p^-$ in the past of $\Sigma_p^+$. Let also $\{\chi_+,\chi_-\}$ be a [[partition of unity]] subordinate to the cover $\{J^+(\Sigma_p^-), J^-(\Sigma_p^+)\}$ of $\Sigma$, that is, smooth functions such $\chi_+ + \chi_- = 1$, while $\chi_+ = 0$ on the past of $\Sigma_p^-$ and $\chi_- = 0$ on the future of $\Sigma_p^+$.

We can use these functions to define the following [[contracting homotopy]] of our complex into itself:
$$
  \begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
  0 &
    \to & 
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E) &
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
    \overset{\mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E) &
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
     \to &
  0
  \\
  & &
  {\downarrow} id & {\swarrow} {}_\chi\mathrm{G} &
  {\downarrow} id & {\swarrow} P_\chi &
  {\downarrow} id & {\swarrow} \mathrm{G}_\chi &
  {\downarrow} id
  \\
  0 &
    \to & 
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E) &
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
    \overset{\mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E) &
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
     \to &
  0
  \end{array}
$$

The homotopy maps are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  {}_\chi\mathrm{G}[\tilde{\alpha}^*]
  &= \chi_+ \mathrm{G}_-[\tilde{\alpha}^*]
    + \chi_- \mathrm{G}_+[\tilde{\alpha}^*] , \\
  P_\chi[\psi]
  &= P[\chi_+\psi] - \chi_+ P[\psi] = -P[\chi_-\psi] + \chi_- P[\psi] , \\
  \mathrm{G}_\chi[\tilde{\alpha}^*]
  &= \mathrm{G}_+[\chi_+\tilde{\alpha}^*] + \mathrm{G}_-[\chi_-\tilde{\alpha}^*] .
\end{aligned}
$$

The contracting identities

$$
\begin{aligned}
  {}_\chi\mathrm{G} \circ P &= id , \\
  P\circ {}_\chi\mathrm{G} + P_\chi \circ \mathrm{G} &= id , \\
  \mathrm{G}\circ P_\chi + \mathrm{G}_\chi \circ P &= id , \\
  P \circ \mathrm{G}_\chi &= id ,
\end{aligned}
$$
are simply a matter of direct calculation.

The identity morphism of our complex to itself induces an isomorphism on its cohomology. On the other hand, since this morphism itself is induced by a homotopy, it must be in fact be the zero map on cohomology. This is only possible when all cohomologies vanish and our complex is exact. The continuity of the differential operators $P$ and $P^*$ is standard. The continuity of the Green function acting on smooth functions was already noted in prop. \ref{GreenFunctionsAreContinuous}.


To see the second exact sequences, observe that differential operators extend continuously to distributions in a standard way. The only nontrivial check is on the Green functions. Their continuity is discussed in ([Sanders 13, sec. 5](#Sanders12)) and ([Baer 14, lem. 4.1](#Baer14)). The exactness follows from the same argument as in the previous argument (since a contracting homotopy dualizes to a contracting homotopy). The exactness of a sequence similar to the one above also appears as ([B&#228;r 14, thm. 4.3](#Baer14)). The continuity of the extensions of Green functions to distribution follows from standard arguments, which was checked for instance in ([B&#228;r 14, lem. 4.1](#Baer14)). The standard argument consists of noting that the adjoint of a continuous linear map is also continuous, both for the weak and strong topologies on distributions ([Treves 67, prop.-cor. 19.5](#Treves67)).

###### Proof

Observe that both $\ker_{scp}(P) \subset \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E)$ and $im_{tcp}(P^*) \subset \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*)$ are [[closed subspaces]]: the first by [[continuous function|continuity]] of $P$ and the second by exactness of the sequence (eq:GreenHyperbolicOperatorDualExactSequence) in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}, which implies that this, too, is the kernel of a continuous linear functional. 

This implies ([Treves 67, props. 35.5, 35.6](#Treves67)) that the linear isomorphisms

$$
  (ker(P))^\ast 
  \;\simeq\;
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)/im_{cp}(P^\ast)
$$

and 

$$
  \label{ContinuousLinearDualsOnGreenHyperbolicSolutionSpace}
  (\ker_{scp}(P))^* 
    \;\simeq\; 
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*) / im_{tcp}(P^*) 
$$

obtained from the underlying exact sequences of vector spaces in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem} are also [[continuous linear map|continuous]] linear isomorphisms for the [[dual space]] topology on the left. 

The first of these is the statement 1) to be proven.

From the second, by once again exploiting the exactness of the sequence (eq:GreenHyperbolicOperatorDualExactSequence) in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}, we also have the chain of isomorphisms

$$
  \label{ChainOfIsomorphisms}
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*) / im_{tcp}(P^*)
  \simeq \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*) / \ker_{tcp}(G_{P^*})
  \underoverset{\simeq}{G_{P^\ast}}{\to}
  \ker(P^*) \subset \Gamma'_{\Sigma}({E}).
$$

Combining this with (eq:ContinuousLinearDualsOnGreenHyperbolicSolutionSpace)
yields the desired isomorphism in 2)

The same argument applied to the exact sequence (eq:GreenHyperbolicOperatorDualExactSequence2) yields the second statement in 2)

### The $P$-Symplectic and $P$-Peierls brackets
 {#PSymplecticAndPPeierlsBracket}


+-- {: .num_defn #BracketPSymplecticAndPPeierls}
###### Definition
**($P$-Symplectic and $P$-Peierls bracket)**

Let

$$
  P, P^\ast \;\colon\;\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)
$$ 

be a pair of [[Green hyperbolic differential operators]] (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) which are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] (def. \ref{FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperators}) via a differential operator $K$ (eq:FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperatorWitness).

Then:

1. Consider $\ker_{scp}(P) \subset \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E)$ and $\ker'(P^*) \subset \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(E)$, where $\ker'$ simply means that we are considering distributional solutions. For any [[Cauchy surface]] $\Sigma_p \overset{\iota_{\Sigma_p}}{\hookrightarrow} \Sigma$ the _$P$-Symplectic bracket_ is the [[bilinear map]]
   $$
     \array{
       \ker_{scp}(P) \otimes \ker'(P^*)
         &\overset{ \left\{-,- \right\}_{\Sigma_p,K} }{\longrightarrow}&
       \mathbb{R}
       \\
       (\mathbf{\Phi}_1, \mathbf{\Phi}_2)
       &\mapsto&
       \underset{\Sigma_p}{\int} (\iota_{\Sigma_p})^\ast K(\mathbf{\Phi}_1, \mathbf{\Phi}_2)
     }
   $$
Note that, even though $\Phi_2\in \ker'(P^*)$ is a distribution on $\Sigma$, we are integrating it over a codimension-$1$ surface $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$. In this case, the restriction to $\Sigma_p$ is well-defined by the theorem on the [[pullback of a distribution]] ([this prop.](pullback+of+a+distribution#PullbackOfDistributionsWhoseWaveFrontDoesNotIntersectNormalBundle) there). The only condition to check is that the [[conormal bundle]] of the embedding $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ does not intersect $WF(\Phi_2)$. But, since the $\Phi_2$ is annihilated by $P^*$, by the theorem on the [[propagation of singularities theorem|propagation of singularities]] ([this prop.](propagation+of+singularities+theorem#PropagationOfSingularitiesTheorem) there), $WF(\Phi_2)$ contains only covectors that are characteristic with respect to $P^*$ (those on which the [[principal symbol]] of $P^*$ fails to be invertible). But by its definition, a Cauchy surface $\Sigma_p$ must be nowhere characteristic, meaning that its conormal bundle does not intersect $WF(\Phi_2)$.  
Because the arguments $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ are annihilated respectively by $P$ and $P^*$, equation (eq:FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperatorWitness) ensures that the definition of $\{-,-\}_{\Sigma_p,K}$ is actually independent of the choice of $\Sigma_p$.

1. The _$P$-Peierls bracket_ is the [[bilinear map]]
   $$
     \array{
       \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) \otimes \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde E^\ast)
         &
           \overset{
              \left\{ -,- \right\}_{\Sigma, \mathrm{G}}   
           }{
             \longrightarrow
           }
         &  
       \mathbb{R}
       \\
       (\tilde \alpha^\ast_1, \tilde \alpha^\ast_2)
         &\mapsto&  
       \underset{\Sigma}{\int} \tilde \alpha^\ast_1 \cdot \mathrm{G}_{P^*}(\tilde \alpha^\ast_2) = -\underset{\Sigma}{\int} \tilde \mathrm{G}_{P}(\alpha^\ast_1) \cdot \tilde \alpha^\ast_2
     }
   $$
Since $\mathrm{G}_P$ annihilates $im_{cp}(P)$ and the image of $\mathrm{G}_P$ is annihilated by any distribution in $im'_{tcp}(P^*)$ (again, $im'$ refers to the fact that we are considering distributional sections), the $P$-Peierls bracket descends to a bilinear map on
   $$
     \array{
       \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) / im_{cp}(P^*) \otimes \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde E^\ast) / im'_{tcp}(P)
         &
           \overset{
              \left\{ -,- \right\}_{\Sigma, \mathrm{G}}   
           }{
             \longrightarrow
           }
         &  
       \mathbb{R}
     }
   $$

###### Proposition
**([[causal Green function]] transforms $P$-Peierls bracket to $P$-symplectic pairing)**

Let

$$
  P, P^\ast \;\colon\;\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)
$$ 

be a pair of [[Green hyperbolic differential operators]] (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) which are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] (def. \ref{FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperators}) via a differential operator $K$ (eq:FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperatorWitness).



Then the [[causal Green function]] intertwines the $P$-Symplectic bracket with the $P$-Peierls bracket (def. \ref{BracketPSymplecticAndPPeierls}) in that for every [[Cauchy surface]] $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ and all 

$$
  \tilde \alpha_1^\ast

  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) ,
  \quad
  \tilde \alpha_2^\ast
  \;\in\;
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde E^\ast)
$$

we have

$$
  \label{RelationBetweenSymplecticAndPPeierlsBracket}
  \left\{
     \tilde \alpha^\ast_1, \tilde \alpha^\ast_2
  \right\}_{\Sigma,\mathrm{G}}

  -\left\{
     \mathrm{G}_P(\tilde \alpha^\ast_1),

  \right\}_{\Sigma_p,K}
  \,.
$$

([Khavkine 14, lemma 2.5](#Khavkine14))

As currently defined, the pairings $\{-,-\}_{\Sigma_p,K}$ and $\{-,-\}_{\Sigma,G}$ are far from being anti-symmetric. In particular, the two arguments may come from very different spaces. In the self-adjoint case $P=P^*$, we may ask whether the domains of the two arguments may be respectively enlarged or shrunk to be equal and such that the pairing becomes anti-symmetric. When that is possible, we get an honest symplectic or Poisson bracket. The simplest such choices are
   $$
     \array{
       \ker_{scp}(P) \otimes \ker_{scp}(P)
         &
           \overset{
              \left\{ -,- \right\}_{\Sigma_p, K}   
           }{
             \longrightarrow
           }
         &  
       \mathbb{R}
    \\
       \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) \otimes \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)
         &
           \overset{
              \left\{ -,- \right\}_{\Sigma, \mathrm{G}}   
           }{
             \longrightarrow
           }
         &  
       \mathbb{R}
     }
   $$
This problem is analogous to studying (anti-)self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric unbounded operator on Hilbert space.

For $\Sigma$ a [[globally hyperbolic spacetimes]] then the [[Klein-Gordon operator]] $P = \Box - m^2$ (i.e. the [[wave operator]] for $m = 0$) is [[Green hyperbolic differential operator|Green hyperbolic]] according to  def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator} (e. g. [B&#228;r-Ginoux-Pfaeffle 07](#BaerGinouxPfaeffle07)) and formally self-adjoint ([this example](formal+adjoint+differential+operator#FormallySelfAdjointKleinGordonOperator)). The corresponding $P$-Peierls bracket (def. \ref{BracketPSymplecticAndPPeierls}) is the original [[Peierls bracket]].
