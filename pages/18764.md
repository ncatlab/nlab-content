## Idea

A _[[partial differential equation]]_ (PDE) is _Green hyperbolic_ ([Khavkine 14, def. 2.2](#Khavkine14)) if it behaves like a [[normally hyperbolic differential equation]] on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] in that it has unique [[advanced and retarded Green functions]].

_Duhamelâ€™s principle_ essentially establishes the equivalence between [[hyperbolic  differential equations]] with a well-posed [[Cauchy problem]] and Green hyperbolic systems. ([Khavkine 14, p. 12](#Khavkine14))

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[Lorentzian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, or more generally a [[conal manifold]] with [[conal causal structure]].

Let 

$$
  \array{
    E 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$ 

be a [[smooth vector bundle]]. Write

$$
  \tilde E^\ast
     \;\coloneqq\; 
   E^\ast \otimes_\Sigma \wedge^{p+1} T^\ast \Sigma
$$

for the _[[density|densitized]] [[dual vector bundle]]_, hence the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] of the [[dual vector bundle]] with the [[differential n-form]]-bundle.

Write $\Gamma_{\Sigma}(-)$ for [[space of sections|spaces of smooth sections]], and write

$$
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(-)
  ,
  \Gamma_\pm(-)
$$ 

for the [[linear subspaces]] in those smooth sections whose [[support]] is inside the [[closed causal cone]] or [[closed future cone]]/[[closed past cone]], respectively, of a [[compact subset]] of $\Sigma$.

###### Definition
**(Green hyperbolic differential operator)**

A linear [[hyperbolic differential operator]].

$$
  P 
    \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_\Sigma(E)
    \longrightarrow
  \Gamma_{\Sigma}(\tilde E^\ast)
$$

is called _Green hyperbolic_ with respect to the given [[causal structure]] if for every 

$$  
  \tilde \alpha^\ast \in \Gamma_{\pm}(\tilde E^\ast)
$$

the inhomogeneous [[differential equation]]

$$
  P \Phi_{\pm} = \tilde \alpha^\ast
$$

has a unique solution  $\Phi_{\pm}$; and such that this unique solution has [[support]] inside the [[closed future cone]]/[[closed past cone]] of the support of $\tilde \alpha^\ast$, respectively.

###### Definition
**([[advanced and retarded Green functions]] and [[causal Green function]])**

Given a Green-hyperbolic differential operator $P$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) there are [[linear maps]]

$$
  \mathrm{G}_\pm
    \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_\pm(\tilde E^\ast)
    \longrightarrow
  \Gamma_\pm(E)
$$

such that the unique solution to $P \Phi_\pm = \tilde \alpha^\ast$ is given by 

$$
  \Phi_\pm = \mathrm{G}_\pm(\tilde \alpha^\ast)
  \,.
$$

These $\mathrm{G}_{\pm}$ are called the _[[advanced and retarded Green functions]]_ for $P$.

The difference

$$
  \mathrm{G} \coloneqq \mathrm{G}_+ - \mathrm{G}_-
$$

is called the _[[causal Green function]]_ for $P$.
