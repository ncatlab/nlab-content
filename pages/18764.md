## Idea

A _[[partial differential equation]]_ (PDE) is _Green hyperbolic_ ([Khavkine 14, def. 2.2](#Khavkine14)) if it behaves like a [[normally hyperbolic differential equation]] on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] in that it has unique [[advanced and retarded Green functions]].

_Duhamel’s principle_ essentially establishes the equivalence between [[hyperbolic  differential equations]] with a well-posed [[Cauchy problem]] and Green hyperbolic systems. ([Khavkine 14, p. 12](#Khavkine14))

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[Lorentzian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, or more generally a [[conal manifold]] with [[conal causal structure]].
 
$$
  \array{
    E

$$ 

be a [[smooth vector bundle]]. Write

$$
  \tilde E^\ast
     \;\coloneqq\; 
   E^\ast \otimes_\Sigma \wedge_\Sigma^{p+1} T^\ast \Sigma
$$

for the _[[density|densitized]] [[dual vector bundle]]_, hence the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] of the [[dual vector bundle]] with the [[differential n-form]]-bundle.

###### Definition
**([[distribution|distributional]] [[sections]])**

Let $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ be a [[smooth vector bundle]] over a [[smooth manifold]] with [[causal structure]].

The vector [[spaces of sections]] with restricted support from def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport} carry canonical structures of [[topological vector spaces]]. We denote the topological [[dual space]] by 

$$
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(\tilde{E}^*) \coloneqq (\Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E))^*
$$

This is the space of _distributional sections_ of the bundle $\tilde{E}^*$. 

With this notations, smooth compactly supported sections of the same bundle are a dense subset $\Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde{E}^*) \subset \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(\tilde{E}^*)$. Applying the same restrictions to the supports of distributions as of smooth functions, we have the following subspaces of distributional sections
$$
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) ,

###### Proposition
**([[exact sequence]] of [[Green hyperbolic differential operator]])**

Let $\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a Green hyperbolic differential operator (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) with [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}). Then the sequence 

$$
  0 
    \to  
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E)
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)
    \overset{\mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E)
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast)
     \to
  0
$$

of these operators restricted to compact or spatially compact support as indicated (def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport})
is an [[exact sequence]] of [[topological vector spaces]] and [[continuous linear functionals]] between them.

Under passing to [[dual spaces]] and using the isomorphisms of of spaces of distributional sections from prop. \ref{DistributionsWithCausalSupports} this means that there is dually the following exact sequence:

$$
  \label{GreenHyperbolicOperatorDualExactSequence}
  0 
    \to  
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(E)
   \overset{P^*}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde E^\ast)
    \overset{-\mathrm{G}_{P^*}}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(E)
    \overset{P^*}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(\tilde E^\ast)
     \to
  0
$$


In particular this means that there is a [[linear isomorphism]] between the space $ker_{scp}(P)$ of spatially compact solutions to the differential equation and the [[quotient space]] of the [[compact support|compactly supported]] dual sections by the [[image]] of $P$:

$$
  \label{SolutionSpaceIsomorphicToQuotientByImP}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)/im(P)
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\phantom{A}\mathrm{G}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  ker_{scp}(P)
  \,.
$$

=--

The following proof is a slight refinement of ([Khavkine 14, prop. 2.1](#Khavkine14)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\Sigma_p^-, \Sigma_p^+ \subset \Sigma$ be two Cauchy surfaces, with $\Sigma_p^-$ in the past of $\Sigma_p^+$. Let also $\{\chi_+,\chi_-\}$ be a [[partition of unity]] subordinate to the cover $\{J^+(\Sigma_p^-), J^-(\Sigma_p^+)\}$ of $\Sigma$, that is, smooth functions such $\chi_+ + \chi_- = 1$, while $\chi_+ = 0$ on the past of $\Sigma_p^-$ and $\chi_- = 0$ on the future of $\Sigma_p^+$.

We can use these functions to define the following [[contracting homotopy]] of our complex into itself:
$$
  \begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
  0 &
    \to & 
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E) &
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
    \overset{\mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E) &
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
     \to &
  0
  \\
  & &
  {\downarrow} id & {\swarrow} {}_\chi\mathrm{G} &
  {\downarrow} id & {\swarrow} P_\chi &
  {\downarrow} id & {\swarrow} \mathrm{G}_\chi &
  {\downarrow} id
  \\
  0 &
    \to & 
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E) &
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
    \overset{\mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E) &
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} &
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast) &
     \to &
  0
  \end{array}
$$

The homotopy maps are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  {}_\chi\mathrm{G}[\tilde{\alpha}^*]
  &= \chi_+ \mathrm{G}_-[\tilde{\alpha}^*]
    + \chi_- \mathrm{G}_+[\tilde{\alpha}^*] , \\
  P_\chi[\psi]
  &= P[\chi_+\psi] - \chi_+ P[\psi] = -P[\chi_-\psi] + \chi_- P[\psi] , \\
  \mathrm{G}_\chi[\tilde{\alpha}^*]
  &= \mathrm{G}_+[\chi_+\tilde{\alpha}^*] + \mathrm{G}_-[\chi_-\tilde{\alpha}^*] .
\end{aligned}
$$

The contracting identities

$$
\begin{aligned}
  {}_\chi\mathrm{G} \circ P &= id , \\
  P\circ {}_\chi\mathrm{G} + P_\chi \circ \mathrm{G} &= id , \\
  \mathrm{G}\circ P_\chi + \mathrm{G}_\chi \circ P &= id , \\
  P \circ \mathrm{G}_\chi &= id ,
\end{aligned}
$$
are simply a matter of direct calculation.

The identity morphism of our complex to itself induces an isomorphism on its cohomology. On the other hand, since this morphism itself is induced by a homotopy, it must be in fact be the zero map on cohomology. This is only possible when all cohomologies vanish and our complex is exact. (...remains to check continuity...)

=--




Differential operators extend continuously to distributions in a standard way. The only nontrivial check is on the Green functions. Their continuity is discussed in ([Sanders 13, sec. 5](#Sanders12)) and ([Baer 14, lem. 4.1](#Baer14)). The exactness follows from the same argument as in the proof of prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem} (a contracting homotopy dualizes to a contracting homotopy). The exactness of a sequence similar to the one above also appears as ([Baer 14, thm. 4.3](#Baer14)). 

Putting the above results together, it follows:

+-- {: .num_cor #DistributionsOnSolutionSpaceAreTheGeneralizedPDESolutions}
###### Corollary
**([[distributions]] on solution space are the [[generalized PDE solutions]])**

Let $P, P^\ast \;\colon\; \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a pair of  Green hyperbolic differential operators (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) which are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] (def. \ref{FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperators}).

A [[continuous linear functional]] on the solution space

$$
  u_{sol} \in \left(ker_{scp}(P)\right)^\ast
$$

is equivalently a [[distribution]]

$$
  u \in \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(E)
$$

which is a [[generalized solution]] to the differential equation

$$
  P^\ast u = 0
  \,,
$$

and this [[linear isomorphism]] is given by pullback along the [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{AdvancedAndRetardedGreenFuntions}):

$$
  \left(ker_{scp}(P)\right)^\ast
     \underoverset{\simeq}{(-)\circ \mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow}
   \left\{
     u \in \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(E)
     \,\vert\,
     P^* u = 0
   \right\}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Keeping in mind that both $\ker_{scp}(P) \subset \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E)$ and $im_{tcp}(P^*) \subset \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*)$ are [[closed subspaces]] (the first by continuity of $P$ and the second by exactness of the sequence (eq:GreenHyperbolicOperatorDualExactSequence) in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}), on the level of [[locally convex vector spaces]] ([Treves 67, props. 35.5, 35.6](#Treves67)), there is a linear bijection
$$
  (\ker_{scp}(P))^* \simeq \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*) / im_{tcp}(P^*) ,
$$
which is also a topological isomorphism in the weak topology. Then, once again exploiting the exactness of the sequence (eq:GreenHyperbolicOperatorDualExactSequence) in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}, we also have the chain of isomorphisms
$$
  \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*) / im_{tcp}(P^*)
  \simeq \Gamma'_{\Sigma,tcp}(\tilde{E}^*) / \ker_{tcp}(G_{P^*})
  \simeq \ker(P^*) \subset \Gamma'_{\Sigma}(\tilde{E}) .
