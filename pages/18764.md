## Idea

A _[[partial differential equation]]_ (PDE) is _Green hyperbolic_ ([Khavkine 14, def. 2.2](#Khavkine14)) if it behaves like a [[normally hyperbolic differential equation]] on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] in that it has unique [[advanced and retarded Green functions]].

_Duhamelâ€™s principle_ essentially establishes the equivalence between [[hyperbolic  differential equations]] with a well-posed [[Cauchy problem]] and Green hyperbolic systems. ([Khavkine 14, p. 12](#Khavkine14))

## Definition

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[Lorentzian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, or more generally a [[conal manifold]] with [[conal causal structure]].
 
$$
  \array{
    E 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$ 

be a [[smooth vector bundle]]. Write

$$
  \tilde E^\ast
     \;\coloneqq\; 
   E^\ast \otimes_\Sigma \wedge_\Sigma^{p+1} T^\ast \Sigma
$$

for the _[[density|densitized]] [[dual vector bundle]]_, hence the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] of the [[dual vector bundle]] with the [[differential n-form]]-bundle.

###### Definition
**(compactly sourced causal support)

Given a [[vector bundle]] $E \overset{}{\to} \Sigma$ over a manifold $\Sigma$ with [[conal causal structure|causal structure]]


Write $\Gamma_{\Sigma}(-)$ for [[space of sections|spaces of smooth sections]], and write

$$ 

for the [[linear subspaces]] on those smooth sections whose [[support]] is 
1) inside a [[compact subset]], 2) inside the [[closed future cone]]/[[closed past cone]], respectively of a [[compact subset]], 3) inside the [[closed causal cone]] of a [[compact subset]] (spacelike compact support).

**([[advanced and retarded Green functions]] and [[causal Green function]])**

Given a Green-hyperbolic differential operator $P$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) there are [[linear maps]]

###### Proposition
**([[causal Green functions]] of [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] [[Green hyperbolic differential operators]] are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]])**

Let

be a pair of Green hyperbolic differential operators (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) which are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] (def. \ref{FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperators}).  Then also their [[causal Green functions]] $\mathrm{G}_P$ and $G_{P^\ast}$ (def. \ref{AdvancedAndRetardedGreenFuntions}) are [[formally adjoint differential operators]], up to a sign:

### Linear functionals on the solution space

+-- {: .num_prop #ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}
###### Proposition
**([[exact sequence]] of Green hyperbolic system)**


Let $\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{P}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a Green hyperbolic differential operator (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) with [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}). Then the sequence 

$$
  0 
    \to  
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(E)
   \overset{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)
    \overset{G}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(E)
    \overset{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,scp}(\tilde E^\ast)
     \to
  0
$$

of these operators restricted to compact or spatially compact support as indicated (def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport})
is an [[exact sequence]].

In particular this means that there is a [[linear isomorphism]] betwen the space $ker_{scp}(P)$ of spatially compact solutions to the differential equation and the [[quotient space]] of the [[compact support|compactly supported]] dual sections by the [[image]] of $P$:

$$
  \label{SolutionSpaceIsomorphiicToQuotientByImP}
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)/im(P)
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\phantom{A}\mathrm{G}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  ker_{scp}(P)
  \,.
$$

([Khavkine 14, prop. 2.1](#Khavkine14))


Suppose all [[spaces of sections]] here are equipped with suitable [[topological vector space]] structure. Then it follows:

+-- {: .num_cor #DistributionsOnSolutionSpaceAreTheGeneralizedPDESolutions}
###### Corollary
**([[distributions]] on solution space are the [[generalized PDE solutions]])**

Let $P, P \ast \;\colon\; \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)$ be a pair of  Green hyperbolic differential operators (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) which are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] (def. \ref{FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperators}).

A [[continuous linear functional]] on the solution space

$$
  u_{sol} \in \left(ker_{scp}(P)\right)^\ast
$$

is equivalently a [[distribution]] on dual sections

$$
  u \in \left( \Gamma_{cp}(\tilde E^\ast)\right)^\ast
$$

which is a [[generalized solution]] to the differential equation

$$
  P^\ast u = 0
  \,,
$$

and this [[linear isomorphism]] is given by pullback along the [[causal Green function]] $\mathrm{G}$ (def. \ref{AdvancedAndRetardedGreenFuntioons}):

$$
  \left(ker_{scp}(P)\right)^\ast
     \underoverset{\simeq}{(-)\circ \mathrm{G}}{\longrightarrow}
   \left\{
     u \in \left( \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)\right)^\ast
     \,\vert\,
     P u = 0
   \right\}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof idea

On the level of [[vector spaces]], the linear isomorphism (eq:SolutionSpaceIsomorphiicToQuotientByImP) from prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem} becomes, under passing to [[dual vector spaces]], 

$$
  \left(
    ker_{scp}(P)
  \right)^\ast
    \overset{(-)\circ G}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(
    \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)/im(P)
  \right)^\ast
  \,.
$$

Furthermore, by the [[universal property]] of [[quotient vector space]] (being a [[coequalizer]]) an element of  $  \left(\Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)/im(P)\right)^\ast$ is a linear map $u$ out of $\Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)$ which vanishes on the image of $P$:

$$
  u(P(-)) = 0
  \,.
$$

This is the defining property of $u$ being a [[generalized solution]] to the differential equation $P^\ast u = 0$.

Hence it remains to be seen that the statement remains true for [[topological vector spaces]] and [[continuous linear functionals]] between these. For that we need (..?..) that the subspace inclusion $im(P) \hookrightarrow \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(\tilde E^\ast)$ is a [[closed subspace]]. But this follows again by the exactness of the sequence in prop. \ref{ExactSequenceOfGreenHyperbolicSystem}, since that image is also a kernel.

### The $P$-Poisson and $P$-Peierls brackets


+-- {: .num_defn #BracketPPoissonAndPPeierls}
###### Definition
**($P$-Poisson and $P$-Peierls bracket)**

Let

$$
  P, P^\ast \;\colon\;\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)
$$ 

be a pair of [[Green hyperbolic differential operators]] (def. \ref{GreenHyperbolicDifferentialOperator}) which are [[formally adjoint differential operator|formally adjoint]] (def. \ref{FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperators}) via a differential operator $K$ (eq:FormallyAdjointDifferentialOperatorWitness).

Then:

1. For any [[Cauchy surface]] $\Sigma_p \overset{\iota_{\Sigma_p}}{\hookrightarrow} \Sigma$ the _$P$-Poisson bracket_ is the [[bilinear map]]

   $$
     \array{

       \underset{\Sigma_p}{\int} (\iota_{\Sigma_p})^\ast K(\mathbf{\Phi}_1, \mathbf{\Phi}_2)

   $$

1. The _$P$-Peierls bracket_ is the [[bilinear map]]
   
   $$

       \mathbb{R}
       \\
       (\tilde \alpha^\ast_1, \tilde \alpha^\ast_2)
         &\mapsto&  
       \underset{\Sigma}{\int} \tilde \alpha^\ast_1 \cdot \mathrm{G}_P(\tilde \alpha^\ast_2)

###### Proposition
**([[causal Green function]] related $P$-Poisson bracket to $P$-Peierls bracket)**

Let

$$
  P, P^\ast \;\colon\;\Gamma_\Sigma(E) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma_\Sigma(\tilde E^\ast)

Then the [[causal Green function]] intertwines the $P$-Poisson bracket with the $P$-Peierls bracket (def. \ref{BracketPPoissonAndPPeierls}) in that for every [[Cauchy surface]] $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ and all
