## Idea

__First-order set theory__ is [[structural set theory]] with a notion of [[family|families of sets]], which are [[functor]]s $F:I \rightarrow Set$ from an [[index set]] $I$ to [[Set]], the groupoid of sets. This is similar to [[first-order logic]] which has a notion of family of [[proposition]]s or [[predicate]]s. This is in contrast to [[zeroth-order set theory]], which do not have a concept of family of sets defined, and in [[higher-order set theory]], which have families of families in addition to families of sets. 

The [[syntactic category]] of a first-order set theory should be a [[(2,1)-category]] with additional structure, although at this moment it is unclear exactly what (2,1)-category it would be.
