
The _Manifold Atlas_ is a wiki on [[differential topology]] and [[algebraic topology]]:

* [website](http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Main_Page)

and a fully refereed online, open access journal

* [Bulletin of the Manifold Atlas](http://www.boma.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/)

housing refereed pages from the wiki. Pages from the wiki are subsequently independent of a published version, so can continue to develop.
