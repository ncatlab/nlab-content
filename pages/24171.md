## Definition ##

Given a [[dagger 2-poset]] $A$, the **2-poset of partial maps** $Map_\bot(A)$ is the sub-[[2-poset]] whose objects are the objects of $A$ and whose morphisms are the [[functional morphism in a dagger 2-poset|functional morphisms]] of $A$. 

## Examples ##

* For the dagger 2-poset of sets and relations $Rel$, the [[2-poset]] of partial maps $Map_\bot(Rel)$ is equivalent to the category of sets and partial functions $Set_\bot$.
