## Definition

In the [most familiar sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalgebra), a _coalgebra_ is just like an 
[[associative algebra]], but with all the structure maps 'turned around'.   More precisely, fix a [[ground field]] $k$.    An **algebra** $A$ is a [[vector space]] equipped with a multiplication

$$m : A \otimes A \to A$$

and a unit

$$i : k \to A $$

satisfying the associative law and left/right unit laws, which can be drawn as commutative diagrams.   Similarly, a **coalgebra** $C$ is a vector space equipped with a **comultiplication** 

$$\Delta : A \to A \otimes A $$

and a **counit**

$$ e: A \to k$$

satisfying the **coassociative** and left/right **counit** laws.  The commutative diagrams for these laws are obtained by taking the diagrams for the associative and left/right unit laws and turning all the arrows around.  To see these diagrams, try the [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalgebra#Formal_definition).  (Someone please put these diagrams here!)

We can express this idea much more efficiently using the concept of the [[opposite category|opposite]] of a [[category]], together with [[internalization]].  Namely: a **coalgebra** is a [[monoid]] [[internalization|in]] the $Vect^{op}$, just as an algebra is a monoid in $Vect$.

Coalgebras of this sort are an important ingredient in more sophisticated structures such as [[bialgebra|bialgebras]], [[Hopf algebra|Hopf algebras]] and [[Frobenius algebra|Frobenius algebras]].

More generally: 

* a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]] $F : C \to C$ on a [[category]] $C$ -- an _$F$-coalgebra_ --  is 

    * an [[object]] $A$ of $C$;

    * and a [[morphism]] $\alpha : A \to F(A)$;

* a general **coassociative coalgebra** is a coalgebra over a comonad, dual to the concept of an [[algebra over a monad]].


## Examples

### Special cases

* For $R$ a commutative ring, if the endofunction $F : C \to C$ is $F : R Mod \to R Mod$ given by $F : N \mapsto N \otimes N$, then $F$-coalgebras are precisely non-coassociative coalgebras in the specific sense of non-associative monoids in $R Mod^{op}$. (See [[Tom Leinster]]'s comment [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/12/the_status_of_coalgebra.html#c020741)).

* $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebra]]s are [[CoDGCA|cocommutative comonoids]] in the category of chain complexes.

### Classes with extra properties and structure

* [[measure coalgebra]]


## Differential graded coalgebras

These are explored briefly in the lexicon style entry [[differential graded coalgebra]].  (At present this is 'bare bones' with little or no motivation or discussion.)


## Cocommutative coassociative coalgebras

These, in most cases, form a complete cocomplete Cartesian Closed Category, $Coalg$ over which the category, $Alg$, of commutative associative algebras is enriched, tensored and cotensored. The exegesis is much the same whether we consider coalgebras over a field $k$, or graded $k$-coalgebras, or differential graded coalgebras, etc. In each case we need a notion of finiteness: finite $k$-dimension of the underlying $k$-vector space, finite dimension in each grade, etc. We denote by $Alg_f$ the category of (commutative associative) algebras that are finite. 

The basic fact is that a coalgebra is the [[filtered colimit]] of its finite dimensional subcoalgebras. It follows from this that we can identify $Coalg$ with the category of finite-limit-preserving $Set$-valued functors on $Alg_f$.
This is because every such functor is a filtered colimit of representable functors, and for any finite algebra $A$ its $k$-vector-space dual $A^*$ is a finite coalgebra.

The product of coalgebras $C$ and $D$ is given by $C\otimes_k D$. The exponential $C\Rightarrow D$ is given by the functor taking $A\in Alg_f$ to $Hom_{Coalg}(A^*\otimes_k C,D)$. Note that $C\Rightarrow C$ has the structure of a cocommutative coassociative Hopf algebra.

For $X$ and $Y$ in $Alg$ we define $X\Rightarrow Y$ in $Coalg$ to be given by the functor taking $A\in Alg_f$ to $Hom_{Alg}(X,A\otimes_k Y)$.

For $C\in Coalg$ and $X\in Alg$ we denote by $C\Rightarrow X$ the algebra $Hom_k(C,X)$ with $k$-algebra structure induced by the coalgebra structure of $C$. We denote by $C\otimes X$ the quotient of the free $k$-algebra on $C\otimes_k X$ by the ideal generated by elements of the form 

$c\otimes 1-\epsilon(c)$ and $c\otimes x_1 x_2 - \Sigma_i (c'_i\otimes x_1)(c''_i\otimes x_2)$

 where $\epsilon$ is the counit of $C$ and $\Sigma_i c'_i\otimes c''_i$ is the diagonal of $c$ in $C$.

The tensored, cotensored enrichment of $Alg$ over $Coalg$ can be extended to the case of commutative associative $k$-algebras in a topos. It is a consequence of work by N.J.Kuhn, _Generic representations of the Finite General Linear groups and the Steenrod Algebra_, that the mod 2 Steenrod algebra is the Hopf algebra $S(V)\Rightarrow S(V)$ where $S(V)$ is the free graded symmetric $\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra on the **generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vectorspace**. Similar considerations apply to the mod p Steenrod algebra.

Recall that the mod 2 Steenrod Hopf algebra is the dual of the commutative Hopf algebra with generators $\xi_1, \ldots $ with diagonal taking $\xi_n$ to

 $\Sigma_{i+j=n} \xi_i^{2^j}\otimes \xi_j$

 where $\xi_0 = 1$. Its action on $S(V)$ is dual to the coaction taking a vector $v\in V$ to

 $\Sigma_i\xi_i\otimes v^{2^i}$
