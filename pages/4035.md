## Definition

An **open cover** of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a collection $\{U_i \subset X\}$ of [[open subset]]s of $X$ whose union equals $X$: $\cup_i U_i = X$.

## Remarks


When denoting by $Ui \hookrightarrow X$ the inclusion morphisms in the [[category]] [[Top]], each open cover constitutes a [[covering]] family $\{U_i \to X\}$ in the sense of [[sheaf and topos theory]] which is a standard [[coverage]] on [[Top]].

Analogous statements hold for categories of topological spaces with extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]], such as the category [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s.

If an open cover has the property that all the $U_i$ and all of their finite intersections are [[contractible]], then one speaks of a _[[good open cover]]_ .
