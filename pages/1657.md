Measure spaces are used in the general theory of measure and integration, somewhat analogous to the role played by [[topological spaces]] in the study of continuity.


## Idea ##

For the general theory of measure spaces, we first need a _[[measurable space]]_ $(X, \Sigma)$, that is a [[set]] equipped with a collection $\Sigma$ of __measurable sets__ complete under certain operations.  Then this becomes a measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ by throwing in a [[function]] $\mu$ from $\Sigma$ to the a space of values (such as the [[real line]]) that gets along with the set-theoretic operations that $\Sigma$ has.  If $E$ is a measurable set, then $\mu(E)$ is called the __measure__ of $E$ with respect to $\mu$.


## Notation ##

The traditional notation for an integral (ultimately going back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]]) was
\[ \label{Leibniz} \int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x \]
(where $f(x)$ might be replaced by some formula in the variable $x$).  In modern measure theory, we can now understand this as the integral of the [[measurable function]] $f$ on the [[interval]] $[a,b]$ relative to [[Lebesgue measure]].  If we wish to generalise from Lebesgue measure to an arbitrary measure $\mu$ and generalise from $[a,b]$ to an arbitrary measurable set $E$, then we can write
\[ \label{full} \int_E f(x) \mu(\mathrm{d}x) \]
instead.  Now, if $f$ is not given by a formula, then there is no need for the dummy variable $x$, which gives
\[ \label{simple} \int_E f \mu .\]
However, it has been more common to keep the symbol ‘$\mathrm{d}$’ and write
\[ \label{excessive} \int_E f \mathrm{d}\mu .\]
(Note that ‘$\mathrm{d}$’ can be read as 'with respect to' in both (eq:Leibniz) and (eq:excessive), although meaning different things; in the former case, it indicates the dummy variable, while in the latter case, it indicates the measure.)  This notation then leads to replacing (eq:full) with
\[ \label{switched} \int_E f(x) \mathrm{d}\mu(x) .\]
This last notation, however, hides the fact that integrating a function with respect to a measure is a way of multiplying a function by a measure to get a new measure; the integral of $f$ on $E$ with respect to $\mu$ is simply the measure of $E$ with respect to $f \mu$, as can be seen in (eq:simple).

See [Usenet discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math.research/browse_thread/thread/e28593bfd6b83aac/67a61d19e8f4d57f), and contrast (eq:switched) with the [Stieltjes integral](http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Stieltjes_integral).  The notation (eq:simple) has also been used in an introductory graduate-level course by [[John Baez]].

There is also some variation in notation as to whether to use a roman ‘$\mathrm{d}$’ or an italic ‘$\mathit{d}$’; roman is more common in England and italic in America.  But of course, that variation should not cause any difficulties!

[[Eric]]: $d$ is also the [[exterior derivative]] and $d\mu$ is a volume form. Is there a nice way to say this that is consistent with the above? Update: The Usenet discussion probably discusses this, but I'm too lazy to read the whole thing right now (past my bedtime!).

_Toby_:  As a volume form is not, in general, the exterior derivative of anything, you cannot interpret the ‘$\mathrm{d}$’ in (eq:excessive) as an exterior derivative.  You can do this for the ‘$\mathrm{d}$’ in (eq:Leibniz), of course, because that is on the real line, where the volume form *is* the exterior derivative of the [[identity function]] $(x \mapsto x)$.  But in general, an absolutely continuous Radon measure $\mu$ on an oriented smooth $n$-dimensional manifold $X$ defines an $n$-form on $X$ (and vice versa), so if you call the form $\mu$ as well, then you want to use (eq:simple).  (The exterior deriviative of the volume form, of course, would be zero!)

I\'m actually halfway through writing an article [[differential form]] where I will address some of this.  (I guess that I\'m going through old Usenet posts of mine; I am using the conversation that you and I had with John in [this old thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/browse_thread/thread/6a231426b3a313c0/2888a120a9b1f5ad) as reference for some of it!)

[[Eric]]: I look forward to it! By the way, that Usenet discussion was a nice blast from the past :)

[[Eric]]: I put some comments about that discussion [here](http://ncatlab.org/ericforgy/show/Densitized+Pseudo+Twisted+Forms).

_Toby_:  I should note that, even given what I wrote above, there is still a *slight* clash of notation between measure theory and differential topology.  To fix this, the $\mathrm{d}x$ in (eq:full) could be replaced with $|\mathrm{d}x|$.  This has to do with the whole the-absolute-value-of-an-$n$form-is-an-$n$pseudoform and integration-of-$n$pseudoforms-is-more-fundamental-than-integration-of-$n$forms issue.  I referred to this clash of notation in our Usenet conversation [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/msg/e7432a7baad8eac2?dmode=source).

[[Eric]]: It's starting to come back to me now. Yeah, the _measure_ is really a pseudo $n$-form and we settled on the notation $|dx|$ for that. We should at least give a nod to that idea I think in the above.

## Definitions

A (positive) **measure** on a [[measurable space]] $(X, \Sigma)$ is a function to the partially ordered rig $\mathbb{R}_+$ of extended nonnegative reals (in which $0 \cdot \infty = 0$),

$$\mu: \Sigma \to [0, \infty],$$ 

such that 

$$\mu(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} S_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(S_i); \qquad \mu(\emptyset) = 0$$

[[Eric]]: Is there some nice "arrow theoretic" way to state the above? It seems to be screaming to be a functor or an internalization or something.

[[Eric]]: The "products" $\bigcup$ and $\sum$ look like they should be "products" in two different categories. Is that silly?

[[John Baez]]: $\bigcup$ is less like a "product" than a  "sum" --- also known as a [[coproduct]].  The collection of subsets of $X$ is a [[poset]], which is a kind of category, and the union of a bunch of subsets can be seen as their coproduct in this category.  Unfortunately I don't see a great way to understand the sum of real numbers as a coproduct!  So, I can't quite do what I think you're hoping for.

_Toby_:  Finitary unions and finitary sums are both examples of *tensor* products in a [[monoidal category]] (in fact a monoidal [[poset]] in both cases).  Possibly the concept of [[transfinite composition]] can be applied to cover countablary unions and sums as well?  But then I\'m not sure that category theory has much to add to ordinary mathematics\' treatment of that situation.

whenever the $S_i$ are mutually disjoint. A **measure space** consists of a measurable space and a measure on it. A measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ for which $\mu(X) = 1$ is often called a **probability space** (at least in probabilistic contexts!). 

Each measurable subset $S \subseteq X$ induces a measurable **characteristic function** $\chi_S: X \to \mathbb{R}_+$ where $\chi_S(x) = 1$ if $x \in S$, $\chi_S(x) = 0$ if $x \notin S$. A **simple** measurable function is a finite $\mathbb{R}_+$-linear combination of measurable characteristic functions, and a measure $\mu$ induces an **integral** or **valuation** on simple measurable functions by the rule 

$$\int \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_i \chi_{S_i} d\mu = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} a_i \mu(S_i)$$ 

The integral is extended to all measurable functions $f: X \to [0, \infty]$ by the rule 

$$\int f d\mu = \sup \{\int s d\mu: 0 \leq s \leq f, s simple\}$$ 

* Sometimes the notation used is $\int_X f d\mu$. If $S \subseteq X$ is measurable, one may define $\int_S f d\mu$ to be $\int_X \chi_S \cdot f d\mu$. 

A measurable function $f: X \to [0, \infty]$ is **integrable** with respect to $\mu$ if its integral is finite. For measurable functions $f: X \to [-\infty, \infty]$, define $f_+$ and $f_{-}$ by 

$$f_+(x) = \max\{f(x), 0\}, \qquad f_{-}(x) = \max\{-f(x), 0\}$$ 

so that $f = f_+ - f_{-}$, $|f| = f_+ + f_{-}$. We say $f$ is **integrable** if both $f_+$ and $f_{-}$ are integrable, and we put 

$$\int f d\mu = \int f_{+} d\mu - \int f_{-} d\mu$$ 

Finally, a measurable complex-valued function $f: X \to \mathbb{C}$ is integrable if both its real and imaginary parts are; its integral is defined in the obvious way. It is not hard to show that $f$ is integrable if and only if $|f|$ is integrable. Hence a [[pseudonormed vector space|pseudonorm]] is defined on the vector space of complex-valued integrable functions by 

$$\|f\|_1 = \int |f| d\mu$$ 

One has that $\|f\|_1 = 0$ if and only if $f = 0$ **almost everywhere**, meaning that 

$$\mu(\{x: f(x) \neq 0\}) = 0$$ 

The functions which are 0 almost everywhere form a closed linear subspace $Null$ of the pseudonormed space of integrable functions. We say $f = g$ almost everywhere (a.e.) if $f - g \in Null$. The pseudonorm descends to a norm on the quotient space of a.e. equivalence classes of integrable functions, and the resulting normed space is denoted $L^1(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ (sometimes shortened to $L^1(X, \mu)$ or just $L^1(X)$ if the measure is clear).

[[Eric]]: Some day this should hopefully tie into the beautiful stuff on [[Leinster measure]] ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/03/canonical_measures_on_configur_1.html)).
