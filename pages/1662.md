## Definition


Given a [[function]] $f: X \to Y$ and a [[subset]] $S$ of $Y$, the __preimage__ (sometimes also called the __[[inverse image]]__, though that may mean something different) of $T$ under $f$ is a [[subset]] of $S$, consisting of those arguments whose values belong to $S$.  

That is,
$$ f^*(S) = \{ a: X \;|\; f(a) \in S \} .$$
The traditional notation for $f^*$ is $f^{-1}$, but this can conflict with the notation for an [[inverse function]] of $f$ (which indeed might not even exist).  This then suggests $f_*$ for the [[image]] of $f$.

We borrow $f^*$ from a notation for [[pullbacks]], and indeed, a preimage is an example of a pullback:
$$ \array {
f^*(S)     & \hookrightarrow & X \\
\downarrow &                 & \downarrow f \\
S          & \hookrightarrow & Y
} $$



## Properties

* [[interactions of images and pre-images with unions and intersections]]:

  * [[pre-images preserve unions and intersections]] (a general reason for this being that unions are colimits, intersections are limits, and $f^\ast$ is simultaneously a left- and a right-adjoint: $f^\ast$ is right-adjoint to the [[existential image]] and left-adjoint to the [[universal image]])
