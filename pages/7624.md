## Definition

A [[C-star algebra]] is called a _uniformaly hyperfinite algebra_ or a _Glimm algbebra_ (after [Glimm](#Glimm)) if it arises as the [[sequential colimit]] of an increasing sequence of [[von Neumann algebra factor|type In]]-algebras (finite [[matrix]] algebras), hence if it is the [[norm]]-closure of the [[union]] $\cup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i$ of a sequence $A_0 \hookrightarrow A_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots$ of an increasing sequence of $I_{n_i}$-factors.


## Properties

All type III [[von Neumann algebra]] [[von Neumann algebra factor|factors]] can be constructed from uniformly hyperfinite algebras ([Powers](#Powers)).

## Related concepts

These algebras naturally appear as [[algebras of observables]] in [[quantum lattice systems]].
