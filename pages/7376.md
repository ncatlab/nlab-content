##Idea

(This is partially an account of the paper by Abels and Holz (1993) listed in the references below. It is augmented with some simple examples and discussion.)

For a group $G$ and a family, $\mathcal{H}$, of subgroups of $G$, consider the nerve of the covering of the set of elements of $G$ by the cosets $Hg$ for $H\in \mathcal{H}$.  Although this is a Čech nerve (and thus we have an established notation for nerves as in [[Čech method]]), we will denote it $N(\mathfrak{H})$ as in the source.

*  The group $G$ is generated by the union of the subgroups $H$ in $\mathcal{H}$ if and only if $N(\mathfrak{H})$ is connected.

*  The group $G$ is the coproduct of the subgroups, amalgamated along their intersections if and only if $N(\mathfrak{H})$ is simply connected.

The point of the article is to explore the consequences of the  higher connectivity of $N(\mathfrak{H})$,corresponding to 'higher generation by the subgroups', but, from the nPOV, perhaps the real questions are to ask in what way does the homotopy type of $N(\mathfrak{H})$ influence the properties of $G$.

The techniques used include the bar resolution construction and homotopy colimits. There are applications to Tits systems and to [[buildings]].
