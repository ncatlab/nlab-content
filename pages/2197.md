## Definition

A [[topological vector space]] is __locally convex__ if it has a [[base of its topology]] consisting of [[convex subsets|convex]] [[open subsets]].  Equivalently, it is a vector space equipped with a [[gauge space|gauge]] consisting of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].  As with other topological vector spaces, a locally convex space (LCS or LCTVS) is often assumed to be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].

Locally convex (topological vector) spaces are the standard setup for much of contemporary [[functional analysis]]. 

A natural notion of [[smooth map]] between lctvs is given by [[Michal-Bastiani smooth maps]].


## Properties

### Continuous linear functionals
 {#ContinuousLinearFunctionals}

One reason why locally convex [[topological vector spaces]] are important is that lots of [[continuous linear functionals]] exist on them, at least if one assumes an appropriate choice principle, e.g., [[axiom of choice]] or [[ultrafilter theorem]] (or just [[dependent choice]] for a [[separable space]]). This fact is encapsulated in the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]; a nice exposition is given in [Tao 09](#Tao09). By way of contrast, a [[topological vector space]] which is _not_ locally convex, such as the [[Lebesgue space]] $L^p([0, 1])$ where $0 \lt p \lt 1$, need not have any (nonzero) [[continuous linear functionals]] at all.

###### Proposition
**(alternative characterization of continuity for linear functionals)

Let $V$ be a [[real vector space]] and $\tau$ a [[topological space|topology]] on $V$ that makes it a locally convex topological vector space, induced from a [[directed set]] of [[seminorms]] $\{p_q\}_{q \in Q}$. Then a [[linear function]] $L \colon V \to \mathbb{R}$ is a [[continuous function]] with respect to $\tau$ precisely if it is $q$-continuous for some $q \in Q$:

$$
  \underset{q \in Q}{\exists}
  \left(
    \underset{C \in (0,\infty)}{\exists}
    \left(
      \underset{v \in V}{\forall}
      {\vert L(v)\vert}
       \leq C p_q(v)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

### Co-Probes and curves

The collections of [[continuous linear functionals]] on a LCTVS is used in a way analogous to the collection of [[coordinate]] [[projections]] $pr_i:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$ out of a [[Cartesian space]]. For example, [[curves]] in a LCTVS over the reals can be composed with functionals to arrive at a collection of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which are analogous to the 'components' of the curve.

In one respect, a locally convex TVS is a [[nice topological space]] in that there are enough co-probes by maps to the base field.
