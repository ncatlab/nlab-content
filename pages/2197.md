A [[topological vector space]] is __locally convex__ if it has a base of topology consisting of convex open subsets.  Equivalently, it is a vector space equipped with a [[gauge space|gauge]] consisting of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].  As with other topological vector spaces, a locally convex space (LCS) is often assumed to be [[Hausdorff space]].

Locally convex (topological vector) spaces are the standard setup for much of the contemporary [[functional analysis]]. 


## Functionals 

One reason why locally convex TVS are important is that lots of (continuous!) [[functional]]s exist on them, at least if one assumes an appropriate choice principle, e.g., [[axiom of choice]] or [[ultrafilter theorem]] (or just [[dependent choice]] for a [[separable space]]). This fact is encapsulated in the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]; a nice exposition is given in Terry Tao's [lecture notes](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/245b-notes-6-duality-and-the-hahn-banach-theorem/). By way of contrast, a TVS which is _not_ locally convex, such as the topological vector space $L^p([0, 1])$ where $0 \lt p \lt 1$, need not have any (nonzero) functionals at all. 

The collections of functionals on a LCTVS is used in a way analogous to the collection of coordinate projections $pr_i:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$. For example, curves in a LCTVS over the reals can be composed with functionals to arrive at a collection of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which are analogous to the 'components' of the curve.

In one respect, a locally convex TVS is a [[nice space]] in that there are enough co-probes by maps to the base field.

[[David Roberts]]: I presume that the example $L^p([0,1])$, $p\in (0,1)$, above is one such example. In this instance (for general $p$), the 'coordinate projection' is evaluation at a point in $[0,1]$, and you certainly want this to be continuous.

Comment from Yemon Choi (please merge/delete as appropriate) David's last comment is plusungood I fear - I don't know what coordinate projections on an arbitrary LCTVS are supposed to be, unless you're restricting to some special class of vector-spaces-of-functions (here is where highbrow people might say "comma category" and where I shall not). In particular: for $L^p[0,1]$, even when $1 \lt p \lt \infty$, it is *absolutely meaningless* to speak of "evaluation at a point in $[0,1]$ since elements of $L^p$ are only defined up to sets of null measure...

[[David Roberts]]: whoops, you're right! That was made up on the fly. I shall try to track down the reference where I learned this supposed fact. It may be that the existence of enough functionals is what replaces the existence of coordinate projections. (I took the liberty of editing the previously dodgy $\lt$ signs in your comment above)

[[David Roberts]]:I removed the offending comment and put in a more reasonable one. This discussion can be deleted.
