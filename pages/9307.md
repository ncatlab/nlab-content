## Idea

_Higher differential geometry_ is the incarnation of [[differential geometry]] in [[higher geometry]]. If the ambient (∞,1)-topos]] is not [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos|1-localic]] then one also speaks of [[derived differential geometry]].

See at _[[motivation for higher differential geometry]]_ for motivation.

## Formalizations

One axiomatization is [[cohesion]] and [[differential cohesion]].

## Examples

* [[Smooth∞Grpd]], [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]].
