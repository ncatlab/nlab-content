## Definition

###### Definition

A [[Lie group]] $G$ is called _reductive_ if its [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is *reductive*, i.e., a [[direct sum]] of an abelian and a [[semisimple Lie algebra]].

###### Remark

A Lie algebra is reductive if and only if its [[adjoint representation]] is [[completely reducible]], but this does not imply that all of its finite dimensional representations are completely reducible.

###### Remark

The concept of reductive is not quite the same for [[Lie groups]] as it is for [[algebraic groups]] (see at _[[reductive algebraic group]]_) because a reductive Lie group can be the group of real points of a unipotent algebraic group.
