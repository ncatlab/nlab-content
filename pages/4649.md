## Reductive Lie groups

### Definition

A [[Lie group]] $G$ is called _reductive_ if its [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is _reductive_ , which is the case if it is the the [[direct sum]] of an abelian and a [[semisimple Lie algebra]]. 

### Properties

A Lie algebra is reductive if and only if its [[adjoint representation]] is completely [[reducible representation|reducible]], but this does not imply that all of its finite dimensional representations are completely reducible. 

The concept of reductive is not quite the same for Lie groups as it is for algebraic groups because a reductive Lie group can be the group of real points of a unipotent algebraic group.
