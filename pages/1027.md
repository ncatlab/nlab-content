## Definition

A __fibre product__ or __fiber product__ is a [[product]] in a [[over category|slice category]] $\mathcal{C} \downarrow C$.  The fibre product of two morphisms $f\colon A \to C$, $g\colon B \to C$ is the same as their [[pullback]]; accordingly, a fiber product of more than two morphisms $f_i\colon A_i \to C$ is often called a __wide pullback__. 

More explicitly, for $f\colon A \to C$ and $g\colon B \to C$ two [[morphism]]s in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, the fiber product $A \times_C B$ of $A$ with $B$ over $C$ is, if it exists, [[generalized the|the]] [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     A \times_C B &\to& B
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^g
     \\
     A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& C
  }
  \,.
$$

This term comes from thinking of $A$ and $B$ as [[bundle]]s over $C$; then the fiber of $A \times_C B$ over a [[generalized element]] $x$ of $C$ is the [[product]] of the fibers of $A$ and $B$ over $x$.  In other words, the fiber product is the product taken fiber-wise.

Of course, the fiber of $A$ at the generalized element $x\colon I \to C$ is itself a fibre product $I \times_C A$; the terminology depends on your point of view.


## Examples

In $\mathcal{C} =$ [[Set]], the fiber product is given by the usual formula
$$
  A \times_C B = 
  \left\{
    (a,b) \in A \times B \;|\;
    f(a) = g(b) 
  \right\}
  \,.

[[Chris Brav|Chris]]: I'd appreciate it if someone could add an explanation of fiber products as limits of compsimplicial diagrams $A \times B, A \times C \times B, A \times C \times C \times A,...$, making the coface maps explicit.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I think it should work like this:

the first two coface maps are in full detail given by

$$
  A\times B
  \stackrel{(Id_A \circ p_1) \times (f\circ p_1) \times (Id_B \circ p_2)}{\to}
  A \times C \times B
$$

and

$$
  A\times B
  \stackrel{(Id_A \circ p_1) \times (g\circ p_2) \times (Id_B \circ p_2)}{\to}
  A \times C \times B
$$

With that it is clear that the fiber product 
$A \times_C B$ is the [[equalizer]] of these two maps, i.e. the limit over the diagram

$$
  A \times B \stackrel{\to}{\to}  A \times C \times B
 \,.
$$

I am guessing, but haven't really checked in detail that the further coface maps continue this: the "inner" ones come from the diagonal $C \to C \times C$ and the outer ones from $f$ and $g$ as above. So for instance the next three would be

$$
  A \times C \times B
  \stackrel{(Id_A \circ p_1) \times (f \circ p_1) \times ( Id_C\circ p_2) \times (Id_B \circ p_3)}{\to}
  A \times C  \times C \times B
$$

and

$$
  A \times C \times B
  \stackrel{(Id_A \circ p_1) \times (Id_C \times Id_C \circ p_2) \times (Id_B \circ p_3)}{\to}
  A \times C  \times C \times B
$$

and

$$
  A \times C \times B
  \stackrel{(Id_A \circ p_1) \times (Id_C \circ p_2) \times ( g \circ p_3) \times (Id_B \circ p_3)}{\to}
  A \times C  \times C \times B
$$

This way, unless I am making a mistake, the ordinary limit over the diagram 

$$
  A \times B \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  A \times C \times B
  \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
  A \times C \times C \times B
$$

would still be $A \times_C B$, but the homotopy limit would pick up the right first degree correction for the homotopy fiber product.

[[Chris Brav|Chris]]: Thanks, Urs. I'll continue thinking about this. While I was at the coffee shop, I realized
that to form $A \times_C B$ in a homotopically meaningful way, we should somehow resolve $B$. So if $\mathcal{D}$ is our category and $\mathcal{D}_C$ is the category of objects over $C \in \mathcal{D}$, then we have an adjoint
pair of functors $R:= C\times? : \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_C$ and $L:=\mathcal{D}_C \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ forgetting the map to $C$. (Strange to me, but it seems that forgetting here is the left adjoint.) Then
we can apply the monad $R L$ to $B \rightarrow C$ to get
a cobar resolution of $B$, take the product with $A$, and so get the cosimplicial object $A \times C \times B, A \times C \times C \times B,...$. 

Perhaps this is the wrong section to discuss this, and when we figure it out, maybe we should make a section on 
fiber products of derived spaces.
