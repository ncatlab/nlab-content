## Definition

A __fibre product__ or __fiber product__ is a [[product]] in a [[over category|slice category]] $\mathcal{C} \downarrow C$.  The fibre product of two morphisms $f\colon A \to C$, $g\colon B \to C$ is the same as their [[pullback]]; accordingly, a fiber product of more than two morphisms $f_i\colon A_i \to C$ is often called a __wide pullback__. 

More explicitly, for $f\colon A \to C$ and $g\colon B \to C$ two [[morphism]]s in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, the fiber product $A \times_C B$ of $A$ with $B$ over $C$ is, if it exists, [[generalized the|the]] [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     A \times_C B &\to& B
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^g
     \\
     A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& C
  }
  \,.
$$

This term comes from thinking of $A$ and $B$ as [[bundle]]s over $C$; then the fiber of $A \times_C B$ over a [[generalized element]] $x$ of $C$ is the [[product]] of the fibers of $A$ and $B$ over $x$.  In other words, the fiber product is the product taken fiber-wise.

Of course, the fiber of $A$ at the generalized element $x\colon I \to C$ is itself a fibre product $I \times_C A$; the terminology depends on your point of view.


## Examples

In $\mathcal{C} =$ [[Set]], the fiber product is given by the usual formula
$$
  A \times_C B = 
  \left\{
    (a,b) \in A \times B \;|\;
    f(a) = g(b) 
  \right\}
  \,.
$$
