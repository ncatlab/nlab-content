## Idea

In [[quantum mechanics]], given an [[algebra of quantum observables]], a _classical context_ is a [[poset of commutative subalgebras|commutative subalgebra]].

The [[quantum observables]] in such a commutative subalgebra may all be [[measurement|measured]] simultaneously without the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]] interfering, hence they may be measured as [[observables]] in [[classical mechanics]].
