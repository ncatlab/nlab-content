A __quantum channel__ is a mapping between [[Hilbert spaces]], $\Phi : L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B})$, where $L(\mathcal{H}_{i})$ is the family of operators on $\mathcal{H}_{i}$.

[[David Roberts]]: Can we write this as:

>A __quantum channel__ is an arrow in a category whose objects are Hilbert spaces, and the arrow itself is a morphism of C-star algebras $\Phi : L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B})$, where $L(\mathcal{H}_{i})$ is a *-subalgebra of $B(\mathcal{H}_i)$ (if this is the case) Clearly one cannot just take a family of operators and then say by fiat they can be considered as a C-star algebra.


> [[Ian Durham]]:(What's the accepted formatting for replying to a query by the way?)  Anyway, in answer to your question, I would say "maybe."  So, the first thing I would say is that this construction (as I have it written) isn't what I originally had.  I originally had (in a paper I was working on) something akin to what you wrote, but several people commented on it and said it should be the way I wrote it here.  Here's (I think) the rationale: since quantum channels can also carry classical information, i.e. $\Phi : L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \otimes C(X) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B})$, where $C(X)$ where $C(X)$ is the space of [[continuous functions]] on some space $X$, the Hilbert spaces are not necessarily of the same dimension.  But in order to form a monoid (which I wish to do in order to make use of Cayley's theorem), I wanted a single object.  So I wanted to make the input and output space the same on some level.  A C*-algebra lets me do that.  Does that make sense?  So it not only generalizes it but also gives me the flexibility to use it for something else (at least that was the intent).

[[David Roberts]]: (just keep going between the last comment and the equals-hyphen-hyphen which closes the query. Also starting with your name flags to people who stumble on the entry who is \'speaking\'. I added your name above so my quotation didn't run into your reply) I would suggest, that the category is \'better\' than the monoid, and instead of Cayley the [[Yoneda lemma]] may be handy to get an analogous result. You wrote

>several people commented on it and said it should be the way I wrote it here. 

to which I reply they probably weren't category theorists :)

[[Ian Durham]]: And you would probably be right.  It's amazing how many mathematicians have no clue about category theory.  I expect it of my fellow physicists, but mathematicians?  Well, anyway, I digress.  Categories.  It's like the old saying about the turtles - it's categories all the way down (or up).  I will take a look at the Yoneda lemma.  Since we're on the topic, let me explain my justification for originally going with Cayley's theorem.  In quantum mechanics we like unitaries because they correspond to physical things like beamsplitters, phase shifters, butter knives, etc.  If I start with a monoid (a single-object category with all the arrows isomorphisms), I have a group.  Via Cayley's theorem I can then find an isomorphism to a permutation group.  If that permutation group is finite, then it has a representation in terms of unitaries.  That would be ideal.  But, on a more general note, I also want this to be useful to others (hence nLab) so categories seems the way to go.  (Thanks for all the help, by the way.  This is why I came to nLab.  In case you're interested, I'm attempting to resolve the quantum version of Bikrhoff's theorem using categories which is where this all came from.)

_Harry Gindi_: Using Cayley's theorem here or anywhere is pointless.  You're missing the point of what's going on here.  I also doubt that the people who you asked would tell you to write something that's totally incoherent.  You do yourself a great disservice by blaming this on other people.

_Yemon Choi_: the use of Cayley's theorem still puzzles me. If all you want to know is that the group is finite, then Cayley's theorem tells you nothing towards this: you would either know this at the start, or else have to find an example.

Categories would be useful if you wanted to look at groupoids, I suspect.

By the way, presuming how knowledgeable or fond of category theory some of us are might be a touch presumptuous, no?

In general, we are interested in completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps.  

> Zoran: what this ugly acronym means ? We should have an antiacronym point of view in nlab, whenever the acronyms are not in hugely wide use!

> Reply to Zoran: I have corrected it.  However, I was under the impression it was in wide use.  I used it on MathOverflow without a problem and certainly anyone working in quantum information theory (which is what this is under) should know it.

>Harry: What is "the family" of operators on $\mathcal{H}_i$?  A family taking values in $X$ is just a function $I\to X$, where $I$ is called the index.  

The operator spaces can be interpreted as $C^{*}$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]] and thus we can also view the channel as a mapping between $C^{*}$-algebras, $\Phi$: $A \to B$.  Since quantum channels can carry classical information as well, we could write such a combination as $\Phi : L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \otimes C(X) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B})$, where $C(X)$ is the space of [[continuous functions]] on some space $X$ and is also a $C^{*}$-algebra.  

+--{: .query}
[[David Roberts]]: This would constitute, continuing the remark above, another category, where the objects are Hilbert spaces and the morphisms are pairs $(X,\Phi: L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \otimes C(X) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B}))$. Not sure if this is the case, though, as the proof below doesn't seem to relate very well.

[[Ian Durham]]: Any suggestions on how to restructure the proof so that it works for categories?
=--

In other words, whether or not classical information is processed by the channel, it (the channel) is a mapping between $C^{*}$-algebras.  

>Zoran: the point of view that quantum channels are used for processing information is very biased point of view of one of the engineering fields. In nuclear physics multichannel processes were used half a century ago to formulate nonhermitean perturbation theory, where various emissions of particles, radiation and heat within a nucleus leads to dissipation. We should have a general point of view and not be crippled by somebody's particular engineering fad. 

> Reply to Zoran: Maybe, but the word "channel" (according to the dictionary) implies an information processing context and, besides, that is how they are used in quantum information theory which is what this page is about.  I'm not sure I'd call it a "fad" either.  I go to enough cross-disciplinary meetings to know that its a paradigm that runs across a number of fields and sub-fields.

>[[David Roberts]]:I see Zoran's use as perfectly consistent with the concept of a channel as 'a route through which anything passes or progresses'(dictionary.com - not the best reference, but sufficient) (in that case, particle emission). From an organisational point of view, I would prefer to have a page on quantum channels in generality with pointers to places they are used, and a separate page on quantum information theory, describing among other things how quantum channels are used in that context.

>[[Ian Durham]]: I would be fine with that.  My only point is that, it had always been my understanding that the use of the word "channel" in this context can be traced back to Shannon and von Neumann using it in an information theoretic context.  I've honestly never heard it used otherwise (caveat: obviously I am aware of its use in geography and elsewhere, I simply meant I'd never seen it used in physics in any other context).

> [[David Roberts]]: I was thinking more the analogy with biology, with channels passing various chemicals in and out of cells (cf particles in and out of atoms)

> [[Ian Durham]]: Doh!  Completely forgot about that use.  Well, apparently I am very much mistaken in this regard.  In any case, I definitely would be fine with a general discussion of channels with a pointer here.

Note, however, that these are not necessarily the same $C^{*}$-algebras.  Since the channels are represented by square matrices, the input and output $C^{*}$-algebras must have the same dimension, $d$.  Thus we can consider them both subsets of some $d$-dimensional $C^{*}$-algebra, $C$, i.e. $A \subset C$ and $B \subset C$. Thus a quantum channel is a mapping from $C$ to itself.

[[David Roberts]]: One needs to be careful with this approach, because it is no different to calling on the [[Nash embedding theorem]] and saying all smooth maps between finite dimensional Riemannian manifolds are maps from $\mathbf{R}^N$ to itself. They are _not_ maps from $C$ to itself, because we do not know _a priori_ where the complement of the source algebra in $C$ is mapped. 

> Mmm, ok, good point.  Hmmm.  Again, my justification is because of what I wanted to use it for and also because I wanted a nice, generalized definition that could be used in a category-theoretic way.

[[David Roberts]]: In that case I echo my claim above: stick with the category and forsake the monoid. It shouldn\'t be any more tricky.
=--



The following is a proof that a quantum channel is a [[category]].  The proof actually proves it is a [[monoid]], but the need for it to be a category becomes more clear when we start dealing with these things en masse.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The quantum channels $t: L(\mathcal{H}) \to L(\mathcal{H})$, together with the $d$-dimensional $C^{*}$-algebra, $C$, on which they act, forms a category we call $\mathbf{Chan}(d)$, where $C$ is the sole object and the quantum channels $t$ are the arrows.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Consider the quantum channels

$\begin{aligned}
r: L(\mathcal{H}_{\rho}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma}) & \where &
\sigma=\sum_{i}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger} \\
t: L(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\tau}) &
\where &
\tau=\sum_{j}B_{j}\sigma B_{j}^{\dagger} 
\end{aligned}$

where the usual properties of such channels are assumed (e.g. trace preserving, etc.).  We form the composite $t \circ r: L(\mathcal{H}_{\rho}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\tau})$ where


$\begin{aligned}
\tau & = \sum_{j}B_{j}\left(\sum_{i}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}\right)B_{j}^{\dagger}  \\
& = \sum_{i,j}B_{j}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}B_{j}^{\dagger} \\
& = \sum_{k}C_{k}\rho C_{k}^{\dagger} 
\end{aligned}$

and the $A_{i}$, $B_{i}$, and $C_{i}$ are Kraus operators.

Since $A$ and $B$ are summed over separate indices the trace-preserving property is maintained, i.e. $\sum_{k} C_{k}^{\dagger}C_{k}=\mathbb{1}$.

For a similar methodology see [Nayak and Sen](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605041).

We take the identity arrow, $1_{\rho}: L(\mathcal{H}_{\rho}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\rho})$, to be the time evolution of the state $\rho$ in the absence of any channel.  Since this definition is suitably general we have that $t \circ 1_{A}=t=1_{B} \circ t \quad \forall \,\, t: A \to B$.

Consider the three unital quantum channels $r: L(\mathcal{H}_{\rho}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma})$, $t: L(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\tau})$, and $v: L(\mathcal{H}_{\tau}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{\upsilon})$ where $\sigma=\sum_{i}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}$, $\tau=\sum_{j}B_{j}\sigma B_{j}^{\dagger}$, and $\eta=\sum_{k}C_{k}\tau C_{k}^{\dagger}$.  We have

$\begin{aligned}
v \circ (t \circ r) & = v \circ \left(\sum_{i,j}B_{j}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}B_{j}^{\dagger}\right) = \sum_{k}C_{k} \left(\sum_{i,j}B_{j}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}B_{j}^{\dagger}\right) C_{k}^{\dagger}  \\
& = \sum_{i,j,k}C_{k}B_{j}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}B_{j}^{\dagger}C_{k}^{\dagger} = \sum_{i,j,k}C_{k}B_{j}\left(A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}\right)B_{j}^{\dagger}C_{k}^{\dagger}  \\
& = \left(\sum_{i,j,k}C_{k}B_{j}\tau B_{j}^{\dagger}C_{k}^{\dagger}\right) \circ r = (v \circ t) \circ r
\end{aligned}$.

and thus we have associativity.  Note that similar arguments may be made for the inverse process of the channel if it exists (it is not necessary for the channel here to be reversible).
