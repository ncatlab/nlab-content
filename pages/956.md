A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __connected__ if any two elements that are related in neither order are [[equality|equal]]:
$$ \forall (x, y: A),\; x \nsim y \;\wedge\; y \nsim x \;\Rightarrow\; x = y .$$
This is a basic property of [[linear orders]]; an [[apartness relation]] is usually called _tight_ if it is connected.

Using [[excluded middle]], it is equivalent to say that every two elements are related in some order or equal:
$$ \forall (x, y: A),\; x \sim y \;\vee\; y \sim x \;\vee\; x = y .$$
However, this version is too strong for the intended applications to [[constructive mathematics]].  (In particular, $\lt$ on the located Dedekind [[real numbers]] satisfies the first definition but not this one.)

On the other hand, there is a stronger notion that may be used in [[constructive mathematics]], if $A$ is already equipped with a [[tight apartness]] $\#$.  In that case, we say that $\sim$ is __strongly connected__ if any two distinct elements are related in one order or the other:
$$ \forall (x, y: A),\; x \# y \;\Rightarrow\; x \sim y \;\vee\; y \sim x .$$
Since $\#$ is connected itself, every strongly connected relation is connected; the converse holds with [[excluded middle]] (through which every set has a unique tight apartness).
