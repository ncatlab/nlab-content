
## Idea

Just as an ordinary [[topos]] comes with its [[internal logic]], and [[(∞,1)-topos]] should come with its _internal $(\infty,1)$-logic_ .

Not much is known about this yet. But below are some references that go in this direction.

A discussion of the internal logic of a 2-topos is beginning to appear in

Something like an $(\infty,1)$-[[type theory]] (but as yet without the corresponding logic) is described in
