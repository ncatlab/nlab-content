## Idea

What is called _Gaussian elimination_ is an [[algorithm]] for solving systems of [[linear equations]]. It proceeds by encoding the system as a suitable [[matrix]] and then applying [[elementary row operations]] to bring  it into [[upper triangular form]].

## In constructive mathematics

Gaussian elimination only works for [[discrete fields]] such as the [[rational numbers]] or the [[algebraic numbers]]. The algorithm does not work for other types of fields such as [[Heyting fields]], which means that it doesn't work for the [[real numbers]], however defined.
