__Fernando Zalamea Traba__ is a mathematician at Universidad Nacional de Colombia at Bogotá with main interests in [[categorical logic]], non-classical logic, [[history]] and [[philosophy]] of mathematics. He is also writing essays in cultural studies.

### On the difference between modern and contemporary mathematics

Just as [[Albert Lautman]] identified 5 features characteristic of advanced (post mid-19th century) mathematics (1-5 in this list), Zalamea identifies an additional set of 5 characteristics (6-10 in this list) which emerge only in the mid 20th century and (in addition to 1-5, which are conserved) define contemporary mathematics:

1. the _complex hierarchisation_ of various theories, irreducible to systems of _intermediate_ deduction; 

2. the _richness_ of the models, irreducible to linguistic manipulation; 

3. the _unity_ of structural methods and of conceptual polarites, beyond the effective multiplicity of models; 

4. the _dynamics_ of the creative activity, in a permanent back-and-forth between freedom and saturation, open to the Platonic division and the Platonic dialectic; 

5. the _mathematically demonstrable relation_ between what is multiple on a given level and what is singular on another, through a sophisticated lattice of mixed ascents and descents.

6. the structural _impurity_ of arithmetic (Weil's conjectures, Langlands program, the theorems of Deligne, Faltings and Wiles etc.)

7. the systematic _geometrization_ of all environments of mathematics (sheaves, homologies, cobordisms, geometrical logic etc.)

8. the _schematization_ and the liberation from set theoretical, algebraic, and topological restrictions (groupoids, categories, schemas, topoi, motifs etc..)

9. the _fluxion_ and deformation of the usual boundaries of mathematical structures (nonlinearity, noncommutativity, nonelemantarity, quantization etc)

10. the _reflexivity_ of theories and models onto themselves (classification theory, fixed-point theorems, monstrous models, elementary/nonelementary classes etc..)
