A **Hurewicz fibration** $p:E\to B$ is a [[continuous map]] of [[topological spaces]] that satisfies the *right lifting property* with respect to maps $\sigma_0:X\cong X\times\{0\}\hookrightarrow X\times I$ for *all* topological spaces $X$. This right lifting property is in this context called the **homotopy lifting property**, because the maps from $X\times I$ are understood as [[homotopies]]. In more detail, for every space $X$, any homotopy $F:X\times I\to B$, and a continuous map $\tilde{f}:X\to E$, there is a homotopy $\tilde{F}:X\times I\to E$ such that $\tilde{F}_0=\tilde{f}$ and $F=p\circ\tilde{F}$. 

Instead of checking the homotopy lifting property, one can instead solve a universal problem, see [[Hurewicz connection]].

There is a [[Quillen model category]] structure on [[Top]] where fibrations are Hurewicz fibrations, cofibrations are [[Hurewicz cofibration]]s and weak equivalences are [[homotopy equivalences]]; see [[model structure on topological spaces]]. There is a version of Hurewicz fibrations for [[pointed spaces]], as well as in the [[slice category]] $Top/B_0$ where $B_0$ is a fixed base.
