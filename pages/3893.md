**Cartan geometry** is the common generalization of [[Riemannian geometry]], [[conformal geometry]] and [[Klein geometry]], which replaces the linear tangent spaces of the former with the more general homogeneous spaces of the latter. Intuitively, we are studying the geometry of a manifold by 'rolling' another manifold, the 'model geometry' on it. The model geometry may be any [[Klein geometry]].
