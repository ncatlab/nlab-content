In [[higher supergeometry]] the [[bosonic modality]] $\stackrel{\rightsquigarrow}{(-)}$ which sends [[supermanifolds]] to their underlying ordinary [[boson|bosonic]] [[smooth manifolds]] has a further [[right adjoint]] $\Rh$, see at _[[super smooth infinity-groupoid]]_.

This means that if $\mathbf{Fields}$ is a [[moduli stack]] of [[field (physics)|fields]], for instance for [[supergravity]], then $Rh(\mathbf{Fields})$ is such that for $\hat X$ any [[supermanifold]] with underlying manifold $X \to \hat X$, then maps

$$
  \hat X \longrightarrow Rh(\mathbf{Fields})
$$

are equivalently maps

$$
  X \longrightarrow \mathbf{Fields}
$$

hence are fields configurations on the underlying ordinary manifold $X$. 

In the [[supergeometry]] formulation of [[supergravity]] this is what goes into the [rheonomy superspace constraint](D%27Auria-Fre+formulation+of+supergravity#Rheonomy) which demands that on-shell super-field configurations $\hat X \to \mathbf{Fields}$ have to be uniquely determined by their restriction along $X \to \hat X$. Therefore the space $Rh(\mathbf{Fields})$ contains the _rheonomic field configurations_ among all the field configurations modulated by $\mathbf{Fields}$.
