## Idea

**Dinatural transformations** are a generalization of ordinary [[natural transformations]] and also of [[extranatural transformations]].  The differences can be summarized thusly:

* In an ordinary *natural transformation* $F\to G$, both $F$ and $G$ involved depend on some variable $x$ with the same variance (covariant or contravariant).
* In an *extranatural transformation* $F\to G$, either $F$ depends on $x$ both covariantly *and* contravariantly and $G$ does not depend on $x$ at all, or vice versa.
* In a **dinatural transformation** $F\to G$, both $F$ and $G$ can depend on $x$ both covariantly and contravariantly.

If the dependence of $F$ or $G$ on $x$ in a dinatural transformation is trivial, it reduces to an extranatural one.  Similarly, if the contravariant (or, dually, the covariant) dependence of $F$ and $G$ on $x$ are trivial, it reduces to an ordinary natural one.

Arguably, most dinatural transformations which arise in practice are ordinary or extranatural.


## Formalization

Let $F, G: C^{op} \times C \to D$ be functors. A __dinatural transformation__ from $F$ to $G$, sometimes written 

$$\alpha: F \stackrel{\bullet}{\to} G,$$ 

consists of a collection of morphisms 

$$\alpha_{c}: F(c, c) \to G(c, c)$$ 

such that for every morphism $f: c \to c'$ in $C$, 

\[ \label{hexagon} G(c, f)\alpha_c F(f, c) = G(f, c')\alpha_{c'}F(c', f): F(c', c) \to G(c, c') \]

If drawn out as a commutative diagram, this becomes a "hexagon identity".

### Special cases

If $F$ and $G$ both factor through the projection $C^{op}\times C \to C$, then the notion reduces to an ordinary natural transformation, and similarly if they both factor through $C^{op}$.

If $F$ factors through $C$ while $G$ factors through $C^{op}$, then we obtain a notion of natural transformation from a covariant functor to a contravariant one, and dually.

If $G$ is constant, the hexagon identity reduces to the "domain" version of extranaturality, involving a commutative square of the form 

\[ \label{domain} \alpha_c F(f, c) = \alpha_{c'} F(c', f): F(c', c) \to G \]

where $G$ is constant with respect to the argument $c$.  Similarly, if $F$ is constant, it yields the "codomain" version with a commutative square of the form 

\[ \label{codomain} G(c, f) \alpha_c = G(f, c')\alpha_{c'}: F \to G(c, c') \]

when $F$ is constant with respect to the argument $c$. 


## Dinaturality versus extranaturality

Many people who encounter the notion of dinaturality through the general definition (as in equation (eq:hexagon)) have subsequent difficulty grokking it.  It is the opinion of at least one author of this article ([[Todd Trimble]]), and it was certainly the opinion of Max Kelly, that this "efficient" definition is not the most useful or intuitive one.  Rather, one may be better off grokking the separate squares (eq:domain) and (eq:codomain) -- that is, the notion of [[extranaturality]] -- and how they arise in practice. 

One could try to argue against that by pointing to dinatural transformations which do not reduce to extranatural ones. Here perhaps the most well known example is where $F = \hom: Set^{op} \times Set \to Set$, where we have a class of dinatural transformations

$$\hom(x, x) \stackrel{\alpha_n}{\to} \hom(x, x)$$ 

defined by the rule $\alpha_n(f) = f^{(n)}$ ("[[Church numeral]]s").

A counterargument, however, is that *any* dinatural transformation between functors $F,G:C^{op}\times C\to D$ can be "bent" into domain extranaturality by defining

$$C^{op} \times C \stackrel{[F,G]}{\to} Set: (x, y) \mapsto G(x, y)^{F(y, x)}.$$

Then a dinatural transformation $F\to G$ can be identified with an extranatural transformation from the constant $1$ (the terminal set) to $[F,G]$. Such tricks support the counterargument that the extra generality of the traditional definition is largely spurious, and not particularly helpful in terms of comprehension.

A further argument for the relative importance of extranatural transformations over dinatural ones is that extranatural transformations can be defined for any sort of [[enriched categories]], whereas dinatural ones (including the other special case of natural transformations from covariant functors to contravariant ones) only make sense when the enriching category is [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]].

# Composition

Dinatural transformations cannot, in general, be composed with each other, although there are certain circumstances when they can be (such as when certain squares are pushouts or pullbacks, or when they are in fact ordinary natural transformations).  In general, what we can say is that for two fixed categories $C$ and $D$, the functors $C^{op}\times C^ \to D$ and the dinatural transformations between them form a [[paracategory]].
