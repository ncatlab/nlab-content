Minimal logic is [[intuitionistic logic]] without the _ex falso quodlibet_ rule $\bot \vdash A$.  It may also be defined by starting with Gentzen\'s [[sequent calculus]] for classical logic and restricting to sequents $\Gamma\vdash\Delta$ where $\Delta$ must contain _exactly one_ formula.

Because it is not the case here that
anything follows from a contradiction, minimal logic is a
[[paraconsistent logic]].

Models of minimal logic are cartesian closed categories, optionally
with finite $n$-ary coproducts for $n\gt 1$.  Under the [[Curry-Howard
correspondence]] minimal logic corresponds to [[simply-typed lambda
calculus]].

Minimal logic was introduced by I. Johansson in 1936.
