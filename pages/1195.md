Minimal logic is [[intuitionistic logic]] without the _ex falso
quodlibet_ rule $\bot\vdash A$.  Alternatively, it may be presented as a [[sequent calculus]] where each sequent $\Gamma\vdash A$ must contain _exactly one_ formula on the right-hand side.

Because it is not the case here that
anything follows from a contradiction, minimal logic is a
[[paraconsistent logic]].

Models of minimal logic are cartesian closed categories, optionally
with finite $n$-ary coproducts for $n\gt 1$.  Under the [[Curry-Howard
correspondence]] minimal logic corresponds to [[simply-typed lambda
calculus]].

Minimal logic was introduced by I. Johansson in 1936.
