Minimal logic, introduced by I. Johansson in 1936, is [[intuitionistic logic]] without the _ex falso quodlibet_ rule $\bot \vdash A$.  It may also be defined by starting with Gentzen\'s [[sequent calculus]] for classical logic and restricting to sequents $\Gamma\vdash\Delta$ where $\Delta$ must contain _exactly one_ formula.

Because it is not the case here that
anything follows from a contradiction, minimal logic is a
[[paraconsistent logic]].

Models of minimal logic are cartesian closed categories, optionally
with finite $n$-ary coproducts for $n\gt 1$.  Under the [Curry-Howard
correspondence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_correspondence) minimal logic corresponds to [simply-typed lambda
calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply-typed_lambda_calculus), which is roughly speaking another way of saying that both are forms of the [[internal logic]] of [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] categories.
