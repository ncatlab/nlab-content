## Idea

_Spherical T-duality_ ([Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai 14a](#BouwknegtEvslinMathai14a)) is the name given to a variation of [[topological T-duality]] where the role of the [[circle]] $S^1$, or the [[circle group]] $U(1)$, is replaced by the [[3-sphere]] $S^3$, or the [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$. Where topological T-duality relates pairs consisting of total spaces of $U(1)$-[[principal bundles]] equipped with a [[cocycle]] in degree-3 [[ordinary cohomology]], spherical T-duality relates pairs consisting of $SU(2)$-[[principal bundles]] (or just $S^3$-[[fiber bundles]] ([Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai 14b](#BouwknegtEvslinMathai14b))) equipped with cocycles in degree-7 cohomology. As for topological T-duality, under suitable conditions spherical T-duality lifts to an isomorphism of [[twisted K-theory]] classes of these bundles with twisting by the 7-class.


While [[topological T-duality]] is meant to be a formalization of the [[T-duality]] seen in [[2d CFT]] [[sigma-models]]/[[string theory]], the physical meaning of spherical T-duality, if any, remains unclear at this point, for the moment it takes its motivation from the fact that it is mathematically possible. 

On the other hand, a special role is played in the theory by those $SU(2)$-principal bundles which arise as pullbacks of the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]] along a map from base space to the [[4-sphere]], and this is, at least [[rational homotopy theory|rationally]], just the structure of the [[M2-brane|M2]]/[[M5-brane]] charges ([[schreiber:The WZW term of the M5-brane|Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 15]], [[schreiber:Generalized cohomology of M2/M5-branes|Schreiber 15]]). So maybe there is a relation...
