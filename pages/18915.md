## Idea

In [Frey82](#Frey82) [[Gerhard Frey]] showed that, if the equation $a^{p}+b^{p}=c^{p}$ had any nontrivial integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ for primes $p\gt 2$, the elliptic curve (now known as the _Frey-Hellegouarch curve_ after Frey and [[Yves Hellegouarch]])

$$y^{2}=x(x-a^{p})(x-b^{p})$$

would exhibit certain unusual properties. In particular in [Serer87](#Serre87) [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] showed, assuming the "epsilon conjecture", that if such a solution existed then the Frey-Hellegouarch curve would not be modular.

[[Andrew Wiles]] with [[Richard Taylor]] proved the [[modularity theorem]] stating that all elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ are modular. By [[Ken Ribet]]'s proof of the epsilon conjecture (now known as [[Ribet's theorem]]) in [Ribet90](#Ribet90) this implied a proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]].
