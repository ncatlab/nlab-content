## Idea

A concept of _fractal dimension_ measures how the amount of detail of a given space changes with scale. For ordinary [[manifolds]] this fractal dimension coincides with the usual [[dimension]], taking values in tha [[natural numbers]]. For [[fractal]] spaces however the fractal dimension may be a [[rational number]], hence a [[fraction]] of natural number, whence the name "fractal".

There are various precise realizations of the general idea. They include

* [[Hausdorff dimension]]

* ...
