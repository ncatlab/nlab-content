## Idea

Broadly speaking, _categorical algebra_ is _[[algebra]]_ seen from and generalized via the point of view of [[category theory]]. 
Thus it studies those aspects of categorical and category-like constructions which are in the spirit of pure algebra. 

First and foremost this includes the study of [[monoidal category]] theory, and the corresponding notions of [[monoid objects]], [[module objects]].

More generally, it is about the study of 

1. [[Lawvere theory|algebras over]] [[algebraic theories]], 

1. [[algebra over a monad|algebras over]]$\,$ [[monads]], 

1. [[algebra over an operad|algebras over]]$\,$ [[operads]].

An account of the basics may be found at _[[geometry of physics -- categories and toposes]]_ in the section _[Basic notions of categorical algebra](geometry+of+physics+--+categories+and+toposes#BasicNotionsOfCategoricalAlgebra)_.
