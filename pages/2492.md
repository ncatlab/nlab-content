The notion of a normal subobject is the proper generalization of a [[normal subgroup]] to other [[algebraic categories]]. The notion was found relatively late. In the [[Grp|category of groups]], there are two equivalent descriptions of a normal subgroup: as the [[kernel]] of a homomorphism of groups and as the equivalence class of the unit of some (necessarily unique) [[congruence]].

Given a category $C$ admitting [[finitely complete category|finite limits]], one says that a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $C$ is __normal__ to the [[internal equivalence relation]] $r: R\hookrightarrow Y\times Y$ if it factors through the monomorphism $r$ (i.e. $\exists \bar{f}$ such that $r\circ\bar{f}=f$ and ...)

A **normal subobject** is a monomorphism which is normal to some equivalence relation.
