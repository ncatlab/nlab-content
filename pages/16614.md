## Idea

A _harmonic map_ is a [[smooth function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between two [[Riemannian manifolds]] $(X,g_X)$, $(X,g_Y)$ which is a [[critical point]] of the Dirichlet [[kinetic energy]] [[functional]]

$$
  E(f) \coloneqq \int_{X} \Vert d f\Vert^2 dVol_X
  \,.
$$

where $d f \in \Gamma (T^\ast X \otimes \phi^\ast T Y)$ is the [[derivative]], where the [[norm]] is given jointly by the metrics of $X$ and $Y$ and where the [[volume form]] is that of $X$.

This is a standard [[kinetic action]] [[action functional]] for [[sigma models]].
