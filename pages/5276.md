## Idea

The _flop transition_ is a continuous path in a space of _noncommutative 2-geometries_ that starts at an ordinary complex 3-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau space]], then passes through a point that does not correspond to an ordinary geometry (the _[[Gepner model|Gepner point]]_) and emerges afterwards again as an ordinary CY-geometry -- but now with different [[topology]].

This was found and discussed in the context of [[string theory]] but the phenomenon is a general abstract one in the theory of [[2d SCFTs]] regarded as generalized geometries -- as described at [[2-spectral triple]].
