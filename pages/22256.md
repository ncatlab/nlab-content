[Math-Net.Ru](http://www.mathnet.ru/?option_lang=eng) is a database of mathematical publications in Russian (and Soviet) journals
operated by the [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]] in Moscow, Russia.

It does not perform any reviews,
but otherwise its functionality is similar to that of [[MathSciNet]] and [[zbMATH]],
with a much more comprehensive
coverage of Russian (and Soviet) journals,
as well as freely available full texts of almost all journal articles,
with the exception of a moving wall for the last few years for some journals.
