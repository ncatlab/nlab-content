## Idea

The [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[quantum physics]] ([[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]]) is at its heart [[probability theory|probabilistic]] (see at _[[hidden variable theory]]_). Any [[quantum observable]] in a given [[quantum state]] has a [[probability distribution]] with some finite width around its mean value. A [[measurement]] will find the observable with given [[probability]] in any one of its possible values, and hence it seems as if it "fluctuates". This intrinsic randomness in [[quantum physics]] is referred to as _quantum fluctuation_. (See also at _[[measurement problem]]_.)

In particular the above holds for the [[vacuum]] state of any [[quantum system]]. Hence even when a quantum system is a little "excited" as possible, it still quantum fluctuation. These are therefore also called _vacuum fluctuations_.
