Given a commutative unital ring $k$ and a coassociative $k$-coalgebra $C = (C,\Delta,\epsilon)$ with comultiplication $\Delta$ and counit $\epsilon : C\to k$ a $k$-submodule $I\subset C$ is 

* a __left coideal__ if $\Delta(I)\subset I\otimes C$, 

* a __right coideal__ if $\Delta(I)\subset C\otimes I$,

* a __coideal__ if $\Delta(I)\subset I\otimes I$. 

In other words, a left coideal is simply a left subcomodule in $C$ with coaction being a comultiplication and a coidel is a left subbicomodule in $C$ where the comultiplication plays simultaneously the roles of left and right $C$-coactions on itself.

If $I\subset C$ is a coideal, then the quotient $k$-module $C/I$ is equipped with a canonical structure of a coassociative $k$-coalgebra (quotient coalgebra); the comultiplication is induced via choosing an arbitrary representative in each class.
