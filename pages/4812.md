Given a [[commutative unital ring]] $k$ and a [[coassociative coalgebra|coassociative]] $k$-[[coalgebra]] $C = (C,\Delta,\epsilon)$ with comultiplication $\Delta$ and counit $\epsilon\colon C\to k$, a $k$-[[submodule]] $I\subset C$ is 

* a __left coideal__ if $\Delta(I)\subset I\otimes C$, 

* a __right coideal__ if $\Delta(I)\subset C\otimes I$,

* a __coideal__ if $\Delta(I)\subset I\otimes I$. 

In other words, a left coideal is simply a left subcomodule in $C$ with [[coaction]] being the comultiplication and a coideal is a left sub[[bicomodule]] in $C$ where the comultiplication plays simultaneously the roles of left and right $C$-coactions on itself.

If $I\subset C$ is a coideal, then the [[quotient module|quotient]] $k$-module $C/I$ is equipped with the canonical structure of a coassociative $k$-coalgebra ([[quotient coalgebra]]); the comultiplication is induced via choosing an arbitrary representative in each class.
