## Definition

By __$Topos$__ (or __$Toposes$__) is denoted the [[category]] of [[topos]]es. Usually this means:

* [[object]]s are [[topos]]es;

* [[morphism]]s are [[geometric morphism]]s of toposes.

This is naturally a [[2-category]], where

* [[2-morphism]] are [[geometric transformation]]s 

That is, a 2-morphism $f\to g$ is a [[natural transformation]] $f^* \to g^*$ (which is, by [[mate]] calculus, equivalent to a natural transformation $g_* \to f_*$ between [[direct image]]s).  Thus, $Toposes$ is equivalent to both of

* the (non-full) [[sub-2-category]] of $Cat^{op}$ on categories that are toposes and morphisms that are the inverse image parts of geometric morphisms, and
* the (non-full) sub-2-category of $Cat^{co}$ on categories that are toposes and morphisms that are the direct image parts of geometric morphisms.

### Related 2-categories

* There is also the sub-2-category $ShToposes = GrToposes$ of [[sheaf topos]]es (i.e. Grothendieck toposes).

* Note that in some literature this 2-category is denoted merely $Top$, but that is also commonly used to denote [[Top|the category]] of [[topological spaces]].

* We obtain a very different 2-category of toposes if we take the morphisms to be [[logical functors]]; this 2-category is sometimes denoted $Log$ or $LogTopos$.


## Properties


### From topological spaces to toposes

The operation of forming [[categories of sheaves]]

$$
  Sh(-) : Top \to ShToposes
$$

embeds [[topological space]]s into toposes. For $f : X \to Y$ a [[continuous map]] we have that $Sh(f)$ is the [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  Sh(f) : Sh(X) \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}
  Sh(Y)
$$

with $f_*$ the [[direct image]] and $f^*$ the [[inverse image]].

Strictly speaking, this functor is not an [[embedding]] if we consider $Top$ as a 1-category and $Toposes$ as a 2-category, since it is then not [[fully faithful]] in the 2-categorical sense---there can be nontrivial 2-cells between geometric morphisms between toposes of sheaves on topological spaces.

However, if we regard $Top$ as a [[(1,2)-category]] where the 2-cells are inequalities in the [[specialization ordering]], then this functor does become a 2-categorically full embedding (i.e. an equivalence on hom-categories) if we restrict to the full subcategory $SobTop$ of [[sober spaces]].  This embedding can also be extended from $SobTop$ to the entire category of [[locales]] (which can be viewed as "Grothendieck 0-toposes").


### From toposes to higher toposes

There are similar full embeddings $ShTopos \hookrightarrow Sh 2 Topos$ and $ShTopos \hookrightarrow Sh(n,1)Topos$ of sheaf (1-)toposes into [[2-sheaf]] [[2-topos]]es and sheaf [[(n,1)-topos]]es for $2\le n\le \infty$.

### From locally presentable categories to toposes
 {#AdjunctionToLocallyPresentable}

There is a canonical [[forgetful functor]] $ U : Topos \to$ [[Cat]] that lands, by definition, in the sub-2-category of [[locally presentable categories]] and [[functors]] which preserve all limits / are [[right adjoints]]. 

This [[2-functor]] has a [[2-adjunction|right 2-adjoint]] ([Bunge-Carboni](#BungeCarboni)).



### Limits and colimits 
 {#Limits}

The 2-category $Topos$ is not all that well-endowed with [[limits]], but its [[slice categories]] are finitely complete [[2-limit|as 2-categories]], and $ShTopos$ is closed under finite limits in $Topos/Set$.  In particular, the [[terminal object]] in $ShToposes$ is the topos [[Set]] $\simeq Sh(*)$.

#### Colimits
 {#Colimits}

The supply with colimits is better:

+-- {: .num_prop #ColimitsByInverseImageLimits}
###### Proposition

All small (indexed) [[2-colimit]]s in $ShTopos$ exists and are computed as (indexed) [[2-limit]]s in [[Cat]] of the underlying [[inverse image]] functors.

=--

This appears as ([Moerdijk, theorem 2.5](#Moerdijk))

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let 

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{F} &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& \mathcal{E}_2
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_1}}\downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}}
    \\
    \mathcal{E}_1 &\underset{f_1}{\to}& \mathcal{E}
  }
$$

be a [[2-pullback]] in $Topos$ such that

* $f_1, f_2$ are both [[pseudomonic morphism]]s

* $\mathcal{E}_1 \coprod \mathcal{E}_2 \to \mathcal{E}$ is an [[effective epimorphism]];

then the diagram of [[inverse image]] functors

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{F} &\stackrel{p_2^*}{\leftarrow}& \mathcal{E}_2
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_1^*}}\uparrow &\swArrow& \uparrow^{\mathrlap{f_2^*}}
    \\
    \mathcal{E}_1 &\underset{f_1^*}{\leftarrow}& \mathcal{E}
  }
$$

is a 2-pullback in [[Cat]] and so by the [above](#ColimitsByInverseImageLimits) the original square is also a 2-pushout.

=--

This appears as theorem 5.1 in ([BungeLack](#BungeLack))

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


The 2-category $Topos$ is an [[extensive category]]. Same for toposes bounded over a base.

=--

This is in ([BungeLack, proposition 4.3](#BungeLack)).

#### Pullbacks
 {#Pullbacks}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathcal{X}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(g^* \dashv g_*)}}
    \\
    \mathcal{Y}
    &\stackrel{(f^* \dashv f_*)}{\to}&  
    \mathcal{Z}
  }
$$

be a [[diagram]] of [[toposes]]. Then its [[pullback]] in the [[(2,1)-category]] version of $Topos$ is computed, roughly, by the [[pushout]] of their [[sites]] of definition.

More in detail: there exist [[sites]] $\tilde \mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{D}$, and $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite limit]]s and [[morphisms of sites]]  

$$
  \array{
    && \mathcal{D}
    \\
    && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    \tilde \mathcal{D}
    &\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}&  
    \mathcal{C}
  }
$$

such that

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    && \mathcal{X}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(g^* \dashv g_*)}}
    \\
    \mathcal{Y}
    &\stackrel{(f^* \dashv f_*)}{\to}&  
    \mathcal{Z}
  }
  \right) 
  \,\,\,
   \simeq
  \,\,\,
  \left(
  \array{
    && Sh(\mathcal{D})
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Lan_g \dashv (-)\circ g)}}
    \\
    Sh(\tilde \mathcal{D})
    &\stackrel{(Lan_f \dashv (-)\circ f)}{\to}&  
    Sh(\mathcal{C})
  }
  \right) 
  \,.
$$

Let then 

$$
  \array{
    \tilde \mathcal{D} \coprod_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D} &\stackrel{f'}{\leftarrow}& \mathcal{D}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{g'}}\uparrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \uparrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    \tilde \mathcal{D}
    &\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow}&  
    \mathcal{C}
  }
  \,\,\,\,\,
  \in
  Cat^{lex}
$$

be the [[pushout]] of the underlying [[categories]] in the [[full subcategory]] [[Cat]]${}^{lex} \subset Cat$ of categories with finite limits.

Let moreover

$$
  Sh(\tilde \mathcal{D} \coprod_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D})
  \hookrightarrow
  PSh(\tilde \mathcal{D} \coprod_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D})
$$

be the [[reflective subcategory]] obtained by [[localization]] at the class of morphisms generated by the inverse image $Lan_{f'}(-)$ of the [[covering]]s of $\mathcal{D}$ and the inverse image $Lan_{g'}(-)$ of the coverings of $\tilde \mathcal{D}$.

Then

$$
  \array{
    Sh(\tilde \mathcal{D} \coprod_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{D})
    &\to& \mathcal{X}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(g^* \dashv g_*)}}
    \\
    \mathcal{Y}
    &\stackrel{(f^* \dashv f_*)}{\to}&  
    \mathcal{Z}
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] square.

This appears for instance as ([Lurie, prop. 6.3.4.6](#Lurie)).


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For [[localic toposes]] this reduces to the statement of [[localic reflection]]: the pullback of toposes is given by the of the underlying [[locales]] which in turn is the [[pushout]] of the corresponding [[frames]].
