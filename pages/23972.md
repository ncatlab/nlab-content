## Idea

Given a [[category]], the *isomorphism class* of one of its [[objects]] is its [[equivalence class]] under the [[equivalence relation]] which regards two objects as related when they are connected by an [[isomorphism]].

The set of isomorphism classes of a category is also sometimes thought of as the category's *[[decategorification]]*.

## Examples

* The isomorphism class of a [[set]] is its [[cardinality]].

* The isomorphism class of a [[vector space]] is (labeled by) its [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]].
