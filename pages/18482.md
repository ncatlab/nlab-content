## Idea

What is called _Tate cohomology_ are [[cohomology groups]] $\widehat{H}(G,N)$ associated to a [[representation]] $N$ of a [[finite group]] $G$. In terms of the [[Tate spectrum]] $H N^{t G}$ of the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $H N$ of $N$, these may be expressed as its [[stable homotopy groups]]:

$$
  \widehat H^{-n}(G,N) \simeq \pi_n( H N^{t G})
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [Nikolaus-Scholze 17, p. 13](#NikolausScholze17))

What is called _Farrell-Tate cohomology_ is a generlization of this construction to possibly infinite [[discrete groups]] $G$.

(e.g. [Nikolaus-Scholze 17, section I.4](#NikolausScholze17))
