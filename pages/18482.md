## Idea

What is called _Tate cohomology_ are [[cohomology groups]] $\widehat{H}(G,N)$ associated to a [[representation]] $N$ of a [[finite group]] $G$. In terms of the [[Tate spectrum]] $H N^{t G}$ of the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $H N$ of $N$, these may be expressed as its [[stable homotopy groups]]:

$$
  \widehat H^{-n}(G,N) \simeq \pi_n( H N^{t G})
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [Nikolaus-Scholze 17, p. 13](#NikolausScholze17))

What is called _(generalized) Farrell-Tate cohomology_ is a generalization of this construction to possibly infinite [[discrete groups]] and topological groups $G$.

(e.g. [Klein 02](#Klein02), [Nikolaus-Scholze 17, section I.4](#NikolausScholze17))

## History of the idea

Tate cohomology was introduced in [Tate52](#Tate52) by [[John Tate]] for the purposes of [[class field theory]]. When a finite group $G$ acts on an abelian group $A$, then there is a natural 'norm' map $N$ from $H_0(G, A)$ to $H^0(G,A)$, $a \mapsto \sum_g g a$.

Then the Tate cohomology groups are 

* $\hat{H}^n (G, A) = H^n(G, A)$, for $n \geq 1$.
* $\hat{H}^0 (G, A) = coker N$, for $n = 0$.
* $\hat{H}^{-1} (G, A) = ker N$, for $n = 0$.
* $\hat{H}^n (G, A) = H_{-(n+1)}(G, A)$, for $n \leq -2$.

In ([Farrell78](#Farrell78)), Farrell generalized this construction to possibly infinite [[discrete groups]] of finite [[virtual cohomological dimension]].

Later this was generalized further in ([Klein 02](#Klein02)) to any topological (or discrete) group $G$ and any naive $G$-spectrum $E$.
