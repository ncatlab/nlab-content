## Idea

A **double complex** is a [[complex]] in a category of [[complex]]es. Accordingly, a **double chain complex** is a [[chain complex]] in a [[category of chain complexes]]. That being said there are two conflicting traditions of notation; in the first the above is quite literally true, in the second a slight adjustment is performed to facilitate later constructions. We will give both.

In the presence of enough [[product]]s and/or [[coproduct]]s, there is a _total complex_ associated to a double complex, and the interest in double complexes is often that in these total complexes.

Double chain complexes usually arise from the application of bifunctors ([[additive functor]]s of two variables) of [[additive category|additive categories]] $C_1, C_2, C_3$
$$
  F :  C_1 \times C_2 \to C_3
$$
to complexes in their two arguments. Combining this with the formation of total complexes then yields bifunctors from  categories of complexes to categories of complexes. 

$$
 \tilde F : Ch(C)^{op} \times Ch(C) \to Ch(C)
 \,.
$$

The most important examples of this are induced by the [[hom-functor]] and the [[tensor product]] functor.

Under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] then $\tilde F$ can be understood as the [[internal hom]] between [[infinity-groupoid|higher groupoids]].


## Definition (First tradition)


A double complex, $X$, is a commutative diagram in an additive category in which  the objects are bi-indexed by the integers, 

$$\{ X_{p,q} \mid p,q\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

and with two classes of 'differentials' or 'boundary morphisms':

* $d_X^v: X_{p,q}\to X_{p-1,q}$ called the 'vertical boundary morphisms' or 'vertical differentials', with $d_X^v d_X^v = 0$;

and

* $d_X^h: X_{p,q}\to X_{p,q-1}$ called the 'horizontal boundary morphisms' or 'horizontal differentials', with  $d_X^h d_X^h = 0$;

in addition $d_X^h d_X^v = d_X^v d_X^h$. (To state the obvious, this means $d_X^h d_X^v - d_X^v d_X^h=0$, in contrast to the formula in the second version.)

This gives a commutative diagram:
$$
  \array{
   && \vdots && \vdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n,m} &\stackrel{d_X^h}{\to}& X_{n,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n-1,m} &\stackrel{d_X^h}{\to}& X_{n-1,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
   && \vdots && \vdots
  }
$$

## Definition (Second tradition)


A double complex, $X$, is an anticommutative diagram in an additive category in which the objects are bi-indexed by the integers, 

$$\{ X_{p,q} \mid p,q\in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

and with two classes of 'differentials' or 'boundary morphisms':

* $d_X^v: X_{p,q}\to X_{p-1,q}$ called the 'vertical boundary morphisms' or 'vertical differentials', with $d_X^v d_X^v = 0$;

and

* $\bar{d}_X^h: X_{p,q}\to X_{p,q-1}$ called the 'horizontal boundary morphisms' or 'horizontal differentials', with  $\bar{d}_X^h \bar{d}_X^h = 0$;

in addition $\bar{d}_X^h d_X^v + d_X^v \bar{d}_X^h = 0$.

This gives an anticommutative diagram:
$$
  \array{
   && \vdots && \vdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n,m} &\stackrel{\bar{d}_X^h}{\to}& X_{n,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} & \swArr_{-1} & \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
    \cdots &\to & 
    X_{n-1,m} &\stackrel{\bar{d}_X^h}{\to}& X_{n-1,m-1}
    & \to & \cdots
   \\
   & & \downarrow^{d_X^v} && \downarrow^{d_X^v}
   \\
   && \vdots && \vdots
  }
$$

## Equivalence of the two definitions

One makes a double complex $X$ with commutative squares into a double complex with anticommutative squares by using the same vertical differential $d^v$ but taking $\bar{d}^h : X_{p,q} \to X_{p,q-1}$ to be $(-1)^p d^h$. The same trick can be used to make a double complex with anticommutative squares into a double complex with commutative squares.

## Total complex of a double complex

The **total complex** of a double complex (under the convention that squares commute) is

$$
  tot_{\oplus}^k = \bigoplus_{m+n=k} X_{n,m}
$$

$$
  d^k_{tot_\oplus}|_{X_{n,m}} = 
  d^v_X + (-1)^\bullet d_X^h 
$$

bla bla

$$
  tot_{\prod}^k = \prod_{m+n=k} X_{n,m}
$$
$$
  d^k_{tot_\prod}|_{X_{n,m}} = 
  d^v_X + (-1)^\bullet d_X^h 
$$

Note that these two coincide when the set of non-zero objects $X_{n,m}$ such that $n + m = k$ is finite, for example, when $X$ is a first quadrant double complex.
