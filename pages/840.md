A $3$-poset is any of several concepts that generalize $2$-[[2-poset|posets]] one step in [[higher category theory]]. One does not usually here about $3$-posets by themselves but instead as special cases of $3$-[[3-category|categories]].

$3$-posets can also be called $(2,3)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]].  The concept generalizes to $n$-[[n-poset|posets]].

# Definition

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$3$-poset__ is an $\infty$-category such that all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalent]] for $j \geq 3$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $3$-morphisms, not even whether two given parallel $3$-morphisms are equivalent.
