## Idea

Where a [[quasicategory]] is a model for the notion of [[(infinity,1)-category]] so an _$n$-quasicategory_ is a model for the notion of [[(infinity,n)-category]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

A definition in terms of [[cellular sets]] had originally been suggested by [[Andr√© Joyal]]. This has then been made to work in terms of a [[model structure on cellular sets]] (see there for more details) in ([Ara 12](#Ara12)).
