## Definition


  For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]], then the  Lie algebra of its [[automorphism Lie group]] 

  $$
    \mathfrak{aut}(\mathfrak{g})_{\mathrm{even}}
  $$

called the the _automorphism Lie algebra_ of $\mathfrak{g}$ (or _derivation Lie algebra_), is the Lie algebra whose underlying vector space is that of those linear maps $\Delta \colon \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}$
which satisfy the [[derivation]] property:

$$
  \Delta([x,y]) = [\Delta(x), y] + [x, \Delta(y)]
$$

for all $x,y \in \mathfrak{g}$. The Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{aut}(\mathfrak{g})_{\mathrm{even}}$ is the [[commutator]] operation:

$$
  [\Delta_1, \Delta_2] := \Delta_1 \circ \Delta_2 - \Delta_2 \circ \Delta_1
  \,.
$$
