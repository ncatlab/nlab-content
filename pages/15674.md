## Idea

The _residue_ of a [[meromorphic function]] $f$ at some point $\zeta \in \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[coefficient]] of $(z - \zeta)^{-1}$ (the first order [[pole]]) of its [[Laurent series]] expansion around $\zeta$. Up to a prefactor, this is what is picked up by the [[contour integral]] around that point, accrding to the [[Cauchy integral formula]].
