## Definition

If $C$ is a category than an [[ind-object]] $x\in Ind(C)$ is a strict ind-object if it can be represented in $Ind(C)$ as the (vertex of) a colimit of a small filtered diagram whose objects are in $C$ and morphisms are [[monomorphism]]s in $C$.  

([Grothendieck-Verdier 71, §8.12.1](#GrothendieckVerdier71)). See also [Blanc 96, def. 4.1](#Blanc96).

Dually, strict [[pro-objects]] are limits of small cofiltered diagrams involving only [[epimorphism]]s. 

An ind-object isomorphic in $Ind(C)$ to a strict ind-object is sometimes called essentially monomorphic. A pro-object isomorphic in $Pro(C)$ to a strict pro-object is sometimes called essentially epimorphic. (This is not so good terminology unless we call strict pro-objects epimorphic which does not seem to be used.)
