If $C$ is a category than an [[ind-object]] $x\in Ind(C)$ is a strict ind-object if it can be represented in $Ind(C)$ as the (vertex of) a colimit of a small filtered diagram whose objects are in $C$ and morphisms are [[monomorphism]]s in $C$.

Dually, strict [[pro-objects]] are limits of small cofiltered diagrams involving only [[epimorphism]]s.
