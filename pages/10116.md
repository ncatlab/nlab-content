## Idea

A [[continuous function]] between two [[topological spaces]] that are each [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the [[circle]] is up to homotopy defined by how much it "winds" one circle around the other. This is it' _winding number_, an [[integer]]. Equivalently this is the element in the [[fundamental group]] of the codomain which is represented by the map.

A special case of the _[[degree of a continuous function]]_.
