
In the context of the [[physics]] of [[field (physics)|fields]] One speaks of _relativistic_ ([[quantum field theory|quantum]]) [[field theory]] to highlight that the underlying spaces are [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian]] [[spacetimes]] that model configurations of the field of [[gravity]] according to the theory of "[[general relativity]]", whence the name.

This is in contrast to "[[Euclidean field theory]]". (...)
