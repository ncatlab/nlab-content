## Idea

In the context of the [[physics]] of [[field (physics)|fields]] one speaks of _relativistic_ ([[quantum field theory|quantum]]) [[field theory]] to indicate that the underlying spaces considered are [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian]] [[spacetimes]] that model configurations of the field of [[gravity]] according to the theory of "[[general relativity]]", whence the name, and that the [[equations of motion]] respect this structure, in that they respect [[tangent space]]-wise [[Lorentz group|Lorentz invariance]] (i.e. the [[Cartan geometry]] strucure, see at _[[first-order formulation of gravity]]_).

This is in contrast to other variants of [[field theory]] such as for instance [[non-relativistic field theory]] typically used in [[solid state physics]], where certainly effects of [[general relativity]] are irrelevant, but where even effects of [[special relativity]] may often be ignored. 


Mathematically, the hallmark of relativistic field theory is the key role played by [[causal locality]], notably in the rigorous mathematical formulation of relativistic [[perturbative quantum field theory]] via [[causal perturbation theory]] (also called [[perturbative AQFT]]).

This marks also the contrast to "[[Euclidean field theory]]", where the underlying "[[spacetimes]]" are [[Riemannian manifolds]] (with [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] instead of [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian]] [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]], whence the name). While in good situations relativistic and Euclidean field theory may be related by [[Wick rotation]] ([[Osterwalder-Schrader theorem]]) generally they are very different.
