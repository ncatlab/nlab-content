# Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory with atoms
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

**ZFA** is a variant of the [[material set theory]] [[ZF]] which allows for objects, called _atoms_ or _[[urelements]]_, which may be members of [[sets]], but are not made up of other elements. ZFA featured in early independence proofs, notably [[Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation models]], for example showing AC is independent of the rest of the axioms of ZFA.

[[Zermelo]]'s original 1908 axiomatisation of set theory included atoms, but they were soon discarded as a foundational approach as they could be modeled inside of atomless set theory.

## Definition

There are two possible approaches to formulating ZFA. In both cases, we can further require that the [[axiom of choice]] is satisfied, and obtain ZFCA.

### Empty atoms
The atoms can have no elements, and the [[axiom of extensionality]] is relaxed to only require that non-empty sets are extensional. The axioms of ZFA are thus the usual axioms of ZF where extension is modified to say
$$
  \forall x \forall y ((\forall z, z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \wedge (\exists z, z \in x)) \Rightarrow x = y.
$$

### Reflexive/Quine atoms
We can give up on the [[axiom of foundation]], and introduce the urelements as [[reflexive sets]], ie. sets $x$ such that $x = \{x\}$. In place of the axiom of foundation, we can have an axiom of _weak_ foundation, where we require the existence of a set A such that every element of A is reflexive, and the [[cumulative hierarchy]] built up from $A$ is the whole universe. In other words, if we define

 * $R(0) = A$,

 * $R(\alpha + 1) = P(R(\alpha))$ for any ordinal $\alpha$,

 * $R(\lambda) = \bigcup_{\gamma \lt \lambda} R(\gamma)$ for $\lambda$ a limit ordinal,

then $V = \bigcup_\alpha R(\alpha)$.

## Models

### Fraenkel--Mostowski models
By allowing atoms in our models, we lend ourselves to the method of [[Fraenkel-Mostowski models]], where we can obtain models in which the [[axiom of choice]] fails by imposing some symmetry on the atoms (so that we cannot uniformly pick an atom out of many). Such models are closely related to [[categories of G-sets]].
