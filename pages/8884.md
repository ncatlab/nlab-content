## Idea

**ZFA** is a variant of the [[material set theory]] [[ZF]] which allows for objects, called _atoms_ or _[[urelements]]_, which may be members of [[sets]], but which themselves have no members (and are not the [[empty set]] either). There is a version ZFCA (analogous to [[ZFC]]) which includes the [[axiom of choice]] (AC). ZFA featured in early independence proofs, notably Fraenkel--Mostowski permutation models, for example showing AC is independent of the rest of the axioms of ZFA.

[[Zermelo]]'s original 1908 axiomatisation of set theory included atoms, but they were soon discarded as a foundational approach as they could be modeled inside of atomless set theory.


## Category-theoretic approach

From a modern, [[structural set theory|structural]] [[foundations]] point of view, one can build models of ZFA starting from ZFC by taking a [[topological group]] $G$, considering the [[Boolean topos|Boolean]] [[topos]] of [[sets]] with an [[action]] by an [[open subset|open]] [[subgroup]] $H \le G$ (where $H$ is allowed to vary), and functions $f\colon X\to Y$ which are equivariant for an open subgroup $L \le H \cap K$, where $H$ and $K$ act on $X$ and $Y$ respectively. The construction outlined at [[pure set]] can be varied to construct well-founded pure sets using atoms [ [[David Roberts|DR]]: I have to figure out what the atoms are. I believe they are the [[transitive action|transitive]] $G$-sets.]

Two such examples are the [[basic Fraenkel model]] and the [[second Fraenkel model]] which gave the first examples of the independence of the axiom of choice from a set theory ([[David Roberts|I]] think!).
