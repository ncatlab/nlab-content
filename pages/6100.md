## Definition

Write

$$
  N : Cat \to sSet
$$

for the [[nerve]] functor from [[Cat]] to [[sSet]]. Write 

$$
  {\vert - \vert} : sSet \to Top
$$

for the [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]].

The _[[geometric realization]]_ of categories is the composite

$$
  {\vert - \vert} := {\vert N(-)\vert} : Cat \to Top
$$

## Properties

### Thomason model structure

There is a [[model category]] structure on [[Cat]] whose weak equivalences are those [[functor]]s which under geometric realization are weak equivalences in the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]]: the [[Thomason model structure]].

### Recognizing weak equivalences: Quillens theorem A and B

Let $F : C \to D$ be a [[functor]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(Quillen's theorem A)**

If for all [[object]]s $d \in D$ the geometric realization $\vert F/d\vert$ of the [[comma category]] $F/d$ is [[contractible]] (meaning that $F$ is a "homotopy [[cofinal functor]]", hence a [[cofinal (∞,1)-functor]]), then $\vert f \vert : \vert C \vert \to \vert D \vert  $ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(Quillen's theorem B)**

If for all $d \in D$ we have that $\vert F/d\vert$ is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to a given [[topological space]] $X$ and all morphisms $f : d_1 \to d_2$ induce [[weak homotopy equivalences]] between these, then $X$ is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\vert f \vert$, hence we have a [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  X \to \vert C \vert \stackrel{\vert F \vert }{\to} \vert D \vert
  \,.
$$

### Natural transformations and homotopies

+-- {: .num_prop #NaturalTrafoMapsToHomotopy}
###### Proposition

A [[natural transformation]] $\eta : F \Rightarrow G$ between two [[functor]]s $F, G : C \to D$ induces under geometry realization a [[homotopy]] $|\eta| : \vert F\vert \to \vert G \vert$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The natural transformation is equivalently a functor

$$
  \eta : C \times \{0 \to 1\} \to D
  \,.
$$

SInce [[geometric realization]] of simplicial sets preserves products (see there) we have that $\vert C \times \{0,1\}\vert \simeq_{iso} \vert C \vert \times \vert \{0 \to 1\} \vert$. But this is a [[cylinder object]] in topological spaces, hence $\vert \eta \vert$ is a [[left homotopy]].

=--

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

An [[equivalence of categories]] $C \simeq D$ induces a [[homotopy equivalence]] between their geometric realizations.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Notice that the converse is far from true: very different categories can have geometric realizations that are (weakly) homotopy equivalent. This is because geometric realization implicitly involves [[Kan fibrant replacement]]: it freely turns morphisms into [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalences]].

=--

+-- {: .num_cor #RealizationWithTerminalObjectIsContractible}
###### Corollary

If a [[category]] $C$ has an [[initial object]] or a [[terminal object]], then its geometric realization is [[contractible]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume the case of a terminal object, the other case works dually. Write $*$ for the terminal category.

Then we have an equality of functors

$$
  Id_* = (* \stackrel{\bottom}{\to} C \to *)
  \,,
$$

where the first functor on the right picks the terminal object, and we have a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  Id_C \Rightarrow (C \to * \stackrel{\bottom}{\to} C)
$$

whose components are the unique morphisms into the terminal object. 

By prop. \ref{NaturalTrafoMapsToHomotopy} it follows that we have a [[homotopy equivalence]] $\vert C \vert \to \vert * \vert = *$.

### Categories and posets

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $C$ a [[category]], let $\nabla C$ be the [[poset]] of simplices in $N C$, ordered by inclusion. Its [[nerve]] is also called the [[barycentric subdivision]] of the nerve of $C$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For every category $C$ the poset $\nabla C$ has equivalent geometric realization

$$
  \vert \nabla C \vert \simeq \vert C \vert  
  \,.
$$

=--

### Behaviour under homotopy colimits

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition


For $F : D \to $ [[Cat]] a [[functor]], let 
$\vert F(-)\vert : D \stackrel{F}{\to} Cat \stackrel{\vert-\vert}{\to}$ [[Top]] be the postcomposition with geometric realization.

Then we have a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  \vert \int F \vert 
    \simeq
  hocolim \vert F(-) \vert
$$

exhibiting the [[homotopy colimit]] in [[Top]] over $\vert F (-) \vert$ as the geometric realization of the [[Grothendieck construction]] $\int F$ of $F$.

=--

This is due to ([Thomason](#Thomason)).
