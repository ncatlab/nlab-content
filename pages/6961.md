
The Mazur--Ulam theorem (after [[Stanislaw Mazur]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]]) states that if $E$ and $F$ are [[normed vector space]]s over $\mathbb{R}$ and $f\colon E \to F$ is an [[isometry|isometric]] isomorphism, then $f$ is an [[affine space|affine]] map. For a proof, see either of the references below by Akhil Mathew and Jussi Väisälä. It is based on the idea that a midpoint between two points can be characterized in purely norm-theoretic terms. This is more or less trivial if the norm is strictly convex (compare the discussion at [[isometry]]); in the general case, one cleverly exploits properties of the reflection map $x \mapsto 2 z - x$ where $z$ is a midpoint in question, to arrive at the conclusion.
