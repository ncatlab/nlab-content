The Mazur-Ulam theorem (after [[Stanislaw Mazur]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]]) states that if $E$ and $F$ are normed vector spaces over $\mathbb{R}$ and $f \colon E \to F$ is an isometric isomorphism, then $f$ is an affine map. For a proof, see either of the references below by Akhil Mathew and Jussi V&auml;is&auml;l&auml;. It is based on the idea that a midpoint between two points can be characterized in purely norm-theoretic terms. This is more or less trivial if the norm is strictly convex (compare the discussion at [[isometry]]); in the general case, one cleverly exploits properties of the reflection map $x \mapsto 2 z - x$ where $z$ is a midpoint in question, to arrive at the conclusion.
