It is convenient for the poset $\mathfrak{F}$ of filters to have the reverse order $\sqsubseteq$ to set-theoretic inclusion:

$a \sqsubseteq b \Leftrightarrow a \supseteq b$.

I will call it _the reverse poset_ of filters (or _reverse lattice_ when it is a lattice).

We can denote the lattice operations on $\mathfrak{F}$ as $\sqsubseteq$, $\sqcap$, $\sqcup$, $\bigsqcap$, $\bigsqcup$.

I denote $0^{\mathfrak{F}}$ and $1^{\mathfrak{F}}$ the minimal and maximal elements of this poset.
