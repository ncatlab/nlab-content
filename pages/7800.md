
It is convenient for the [[poset]] $\mathfrak{F}(A)$ of [[filters]] on a given [[set]] $A$ to have the reverse order $\sqsubseteq$ to set-theoretic [[subset|inclusion]]:
$$ a \sqsubseteq b \Leftrightarrow a \supseteq b .$$
We will call it the __reverse lattice of filters__ (since it is a [[lattice]]); compare [[reverse poset]].

We can denote the lattice operations on $\mathfrak{F}(A)$ as $\sqsubseteq$, $\sqcap$, $\sqcup$, $&#x2A05;$, $\bigsqcup$. By $0^{\mathfrak{F}(A)}$ and $1^{\mathfrak{F}(A)}$ we denote the [[bottom|minimal]] and [[top|maximal]] elements of this poset. So set-theoretically, $\mathcal{X} \sqcap \mathcal{Y}$ is the filter generated by the [[union]] $X \cup Y$, $\mathcal{X} \sqcup \mathcal{Y}$ is the [[intersection]] $X \cap Y$, and similarly for $&#x2A05;_i \mathcal{X}_i$ and $\bigsqcup_i \mathcal{X}_i$, while $0^{\mathfrak{F}(A)}$ is the [[improper filter]] (the [[power set]]) $\mathcal{P}(A)$ and $1^{\mathfrak{F}(A)}$ is the filter generated by the [[empty set]], which is $\{A\}$.
