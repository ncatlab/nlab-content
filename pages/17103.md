## Idea


The notion of _CW-spectrum_ is the analogue for [[sequential spectra]] in [[Top]] of the concept of [[CW-complex]] for [[topological spaces]].

Just like [[CW-complexes]] are cofibrant objects in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], so CW-spectra are cofibrant objects in the [[stable model category|stable]] [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]] on sequential spectra. See at _[BF-model structure -- Fibrant and cofibrant objects](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Bousfield-Friedlander+model+structure#FibrantAndCofibrantObjects)_.

## Definition

A CW-spectrum $X_\bullet\in SeqSpec(Top)$ is a [[sequential spectrum]] in [[Top]] such that

1. all component spaces $X_n$ are [[CW-complexes]], 

1. all structure maps $\Sigma X_n \longrightarrow X_{n+1}$ are inclusions of subcomplexes 

(e.g. [Adams 74, p. 139](#Adams74)).

Beware that for instance ([Switzer 75, def. 81](#Switzer75)) says just "specturm" form "CW-spectrum".

## Cells and finite spectra
 {#Cells}

For a CW-spectrum $X$ there is a concept of "cell of a spectrum": this is a cell of one of the component CW-complexes $X_n$, together with all its suspensions in all the higher component spaces, subject to the condition that the first cell itself is not itself the suspension of a cell in $X_{n-1}$.
This way every CW-spectrum is the union of all its cells. (e.g. [Switzer 75, 8.4](Switzer75)).

A CW-spectrum is called a _[[finite spectrum]]_ (or countable spectrum, etc.) if it has finitely many cells (countably many cells), in this sense.
