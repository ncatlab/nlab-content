## Idea

A _simplicial Lie algebra_ is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] of [[Lie algebra]]s.

## Properties

###### Theorem

There is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (N^* \dashv N) : LieAlg_k^\Delta \stackrel{\overset{N^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}
  dgLieAlg_k
$$

between simplicial Lie algebras (over a [[field]] $k$) and [[dg-Lie algebra]]s, where $N$ acts on the underlying simplicial vector spaces as the [[Moore complex]] functor.

This is ([Quillen 69, prop. 4.4](#Quillen69)).

###### Remark

There is a standard structure of a [[category with weak equivalences]] on both these categories, hence there are corresponding [[homotopy categories]]. (See also at _[[model structure on simplicial Lie algebras]]_ and _[[model structure on dg-Lie algebras]]_.) The following asserts that the above adjunction is compatible with this structure.

###### Theorem

For $k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]] the corresponding [[derived functors]] constitute an [[equivalence of categories]] between the corresponding [[homotopy categories]]

$$
  (L N^* \dashv \tilde N) 
   \;\colon\;
  Ho(LieAlg^\Delta)_1 
   \stackrel{\overset{L N^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\tilde N}{\to}} Ho(dgLieAlg)_1
$$

of [[1-connected]] objects on both sides.

This is in the proof of ([Quillen, theorem. 4.4](#Quillen)).
