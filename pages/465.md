## Definition ##

A **regular epimorphism** is a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ (in a given [[category]]) that is the [[coequalizer]] of _some_ parallel pair of morphisms, i.e. if there exists _some_ [[colimit]] diagram of the form

$$
  a \stackrel{\to}{\to} c \stackrel{f}{\to} d
  \,.
$$

The [[duality|dual]] concept is that of [[regular monomorphism]].  A morphism having a [[kernel pair]] (such as any morphism in a category with [[pullback]]s) is a regular epimorphism if and only if it is the [[quotient object]] of its kernel pair (see for instance Lemma 5.6.6 in _[[Practical Foundations]]_); in general, a regular epimorphism with a kernel pair is an __[[effective epimorphism]]__.

Although the definition doesn\'t state so explicitly, it is true that any regular epimorphism is an [[epimorphism]]. In fact, every regular epimorphism is a [[strong epimorphism]]. On the other hand, every [[split epimorphism]] is regular.

In [[Set|the category of sets]], every epimorphism is regular. Thus, it can be hard to know, when generalising concepts from $\Set$ to other categories, what kind of epimorphism to use. In particular, one may define a [[projective object]] (and hence the [[axiom of choice]]) using regular epimorphisms.

As another example, in the category of monoids, the inclusion $\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ is an epimorphism, even though it is far from a [[surjection]].  But in this or any other [[algebraic category]] (a category of models of an [[algebraic theory]]), the morphisms whose underlying function is surjective are precisely the regular epimorphisms.


## In higher context

Comparing the above to the defintion of [[effective epimorphism]], we propose the following definition in an arbitrary $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]]:  A __regular epimorphism__ is any morphism with a [[simplicial resolution]].

[[Mike Shulman]]: I would expect a "regular epimorphism" to be, in particular, an "epimorphism," and I would expect an "epimorphism" $e\colon A\to B$ to mean that $hom(e,X)\colon hom(B,X)\to hom(A,X)$ is a "monomorphism" in some sense.  But it's unclear to me whether morphisms with a simplicial resolution have this property.  In a 1-category, it's true of course that if $e$ is a coequalizer then $hom(e,X)$ is monic (injective), but in a (2,1)-category, all you can say if $e$ has a (truncated) simplicial resolution is that $hom(e,X)$ is faithful (injective on 2-cells).  It seems fairly likely to me that as you go up to the $(\infty,1)$-context the injectivity will be "pushed off to infinity" and there will be *no* monic-like property of $hom(e,X)$ left.

I'm not *necessarily* saying we shouldn't use the term "regular epimorphism" in this sense, since as we know the notion of "plain epimorphism" in 1-categories is not usually very useful anyway.  But if I'm right, I think it would be good to alert the reader that the [[red herring principle]] is coming into play.
