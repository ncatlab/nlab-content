A **regular epimorphism** (in a given category) is any morphism that is the [[coequalizer]] of some parallel pair of morphisms. The [[duality|dual]] concept is that of [[regular monomorphism]].  A morphism having a [[kernel pair]] (such as any morphism in a category with [[pullback]]s) is a regular epimorphism if and only if it is the coequalizer of its kernel pair (see for instance Lemma 5.6.6 in _[[Practical Foundations]]_).

Although the definition doesn\'t state so explicitly, it is true that any regular epimorphism is an [[epimorphism]]. In fact, every regular epimorphism is a [[strong epimorphism]]. Conversely, every [[split epimorphism]] is regular.

In [[Set|the category of sets]], every epimorphism is regular. Thus, it can be hard to know, when generalising concepts from $\Set$ to other categories, what kind of epimorphism to use. In particular, one may define a [[projective object]] (and hence the [[axiom of choice]]) using regular epimorphisms.

As another example, in the category of monoids, the inclusion $\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ is an epimorphism, even though it is far from a [[surjection]].  But in this or any other [[algebraic category]] (a category of algebra for a [[Lawvere theory]]), the morphisms whose underlying function is surjective are precisely the regular epimorphisms.
