## Definition

In the context of [[Goodwillie calculus]], an [[(∞,1)-functor]] is called _$n$-homogeneous_ if it is both [[n-excisive functor|n-excisive]] and [[n-reduced (∞,1)-functor|n-reduced]]. (see e.g. [Lurie, def. 6.1.2.1](#HigherAlg)). 

In the [[analogy]] with ordinary [[analysis]], these functors correspond to [[functions]] which are homogeneous [[polynomials]], whence the name.
