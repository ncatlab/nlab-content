## Idea

The notion if $(\infty,1)$-Kan extension is the generalization of the notion of [[Kan extension]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category theory]].


## Definition

### General abstract definition

Independent of any models or concrete realizations chosen, the notion of $(\infty,1)$-Kan extension is intrinsically determined from just the notions of 

* [[(∞,1)-functor]], 

* [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]]

*  [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]].

In terms of these, for $f : C \to C'$ any [[(∞,1)-functor]] and any [[(∞,1)-category]] $A$, there is an induced $(\infty,1)$-functor $f^* : Func_{(\infty,1)}(C',A) \to Func_{(\infty,1)}(C,A)$.

The  **left $(\infty,1)$-Kan extension functor** is the left [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] to $f^*$.

The  **right $(\infty,1)$-Kan extension functor** is the right [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] to $f^*$.

Given different incarnations of or models for the notion of [[(∞,1)-category]], there are accordingly different incarnations and models of this general abstract prescription.
