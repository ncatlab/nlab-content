An $H$-space (at least one equivalent to a [[delooping|deloopable one]] ) is a [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|group object in the (âˆž,1)-category]] [[Top]] . 

For more details see 

* [[loop space]].

The theory of $H$-spaces was established in

* [[Jim Stasheff]], _Homotopy associative $H$-spaces I, II_, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 108, 1963, 275-312 

For a historical account see

* John McCleary, _An appreciation of the work of Jim Stasheff_ ([pdf](http://www.math.unc.edu/Faculty/jds/jds.pdf))

The description in terms of [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]] is due to 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]

see last remark of section 6.1.3 .

Wikipedia\'s definition (at time of this writing) is rather a [[magma]]-with-[[identity element|identity]] object in [[Top]].
