## Idea

In [[mathematical logic]], a _theory_ is a formal [[language]] used to precisely [[axiom|axiomatize]] a certain class of [[models]].

In principle also all other notions of _theory_, such as in the sense of [[physics]] should be special cases of this, but in practice of course there are many systems called "theories" which are not (yet) as fully formalized as in mathematical logic.

## Definition

There are several different viewpoint on theories:

* The 

  [syntactic view](#SyntacticView) 

  is that the theory itself consists of a set of formulas in the first order language $Lang(\Sigma)$ of a [[signature (in logic)|signature]] $\Sigma$.  Classically, these formulas are assumed to have no free variables (i.e. to be "sentences"), but in weaker logics that lack [[universal quantification]] it is better to take them to be formulas-in-[[context]].  One also sometimes considers the theory to also include all logical consequences (aka theorems) of the axioms in $A$, relative to (some specified) fragment of [[first-order logic]] --- that is, to be "saturated" with respect to provability. 

* The 

  [semantic view](#SemanticView)

  is that the theory is given by the class of its [[model]]s appropriate to that fragment of logic. G&ouml;del's completeness theorem is that a sentence in $\mathcal{T}$ is a theorem iff it is satisfied in every model.  

* The 

  [categorical view](#CategoricalView) 

  is that the logical formalism of a theory $\mathcal{T}$ can frequently be embodied in a [[syntactic category]] of terms $C_{\mathcal{T}}$, so that models of a theory $\mathcal{T}$ are identified with [[functor]]s 

  $$C_{\mathcal{T}} \to Set$$ 

  that preserve some (typically [[stuff, structure, property|property-like]]) [[stuff, structure, property|structures]] on $C_{\mathcal{T}}$, such as certain classes of [[colimit]]s or of [[limits]], pertinent to the fragment of logic at hand. Then a completeness theorem would be the statement that the canonical map 

  $$C_{\mathcal{T}} \to \prod_{models F in Set} Set$$ 

  is a [[full and faithful functor|full faithful embedding]] (one that preserves all relevant logical structure). For this reason, completeness theorems are also known as _embedding theorems_. 

+--{.query}
Hm, is that the way it should be said?
=--

  In fact, the notion of model can be generalized away from $Set$ to more general  [[categories]], namely those that have enough structure to "internalize" the fragment of logic at hand. From this very general point of view on model, the syntactic category $C_{\mathcal{T}}$ is the generic or universal model for $\mathcal{T}$, and if we simply call $C_{\mathcal{T}}$ the theory, then models and theories are placed on the same footing. 

In this article we mostly consider the categorical view on "theory".

### Syntactic view

###### Definition

In first-order [[logic]], a **theory** $\mathcal{T}$ is presented by 

1. a [[signature (in logic)|signature]] $\Sigma$, specifying the allowed [[type]]s of variables and the [[function]]s and [[relation]]s between these;

1. a set $A$ of [[sequent]]s of [[formula]]s in this signature, called the **axioms** of the theory:  expressed in the first-order language $Lang(\Sigma)$ with equality generated by $\Sigma$

and corresponding theories for these logics.

    * [[Fermat theory]]



#### Hierarchy of theories: cartesian, regular, coherent, geometric

There is a hierarchy of theories that can be interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of a hierarchy of types of [[categories]].  Since [[predicates]] in the internal logic are represented by [[subobjects]], in order to interpret any connective or quantifier in the internal logic, one needs a corresponding operation on subobjects to exist in the category in question, and be well-behaved.  For instance:

* **cartesian theories** Since $\wedge$ and $\top$ are represented by [[intersections]] and identities (top elements), these can be interpreted in any [[lex category]].  Theories involving only these are [[cartesian theory|cartesian theories]].

* **regular theories** Since $\exists$ is represented by the [[image]] of a subobject, it can be interpreted in any [[regular category]].  Theories involving only $\wedge$, $\top$, and $\exists$ are [[regular theory|regular theories]].

* **coherent theories** Since $\vee$ and $\bot$ are represented by [[union]] and [[bottom elements]], these can be interpreted in any [[coherent category]].  Theories which add these to regular logic are called [[coherent theory|coherent theories]].

* **geometric theories** Finally, theories which also involve infinitary $\bigvee$, which is again represented by an infinitary union, can be interpreted in [[infinitary coherent categories]], aka *[[geometric categories]]*.  These are **[[geometric theories]]**.

Note that the axioms of one of these theories are actually of the form
$$ \varphi \vdash_{\vec{x}} \psi $$
where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are formulas involving only the specified connectives and quantifiers, $\vdash$ means entailment, and $\vec{x}$ is a [[context]].  Such an axiom can also be written as
$$ \forall \vec{x}. (\varphi \Rightarrow \psi) $$
so that although $\Rightarrow$ and $\forall$ are not strictly part of any of the above logics, they can be applied "once at top level."  In an axiom of this form for geometric logic, the formulas $\varphi$ and $\psi$ which must be built out of $\top$, $\wedge$, $\bot$, $\bigvee$, and $\exists$ are sometimes called *positive* formulas.

### Abelian theories

Interestingly, one form of logic which made an early appearance but is not ordinarily thought of as logic at all is the logic of [[abelian categories]], which is characterized by certain exactness properties. Here a small abelian category $A$ can be thought of as a syntactic site for some "abelian theory"; models of the theory are exact additive functors with domain $A$. The classical models would in fact be exact additive functors $A \to Ab$, or exact additive functors to a category of modules. A "Freyd-Heron-Lubkin-Mitchell" embedding theorem is then a completeness theorem with respect to the classical models, and assures us that a statement in the language of abelian category theory is provable if and only if it is true when interpreted in any module category.

## Models for a theory

#### Set-theoretic models for a first-order theory in syntactic approach

The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language $L$: a set $M$ together with an interpretation of $L$ in $M$. A theory is specified by a language and a set of sentences in $L$. An $L$-structure $M$ is a __model__ of $T$ if for every sentence $\phi$ in $T$, its interpretation in $M$, $\phi^M$ is true ("$\phi$ holds in $M$"). We say that $T$ is __consistent__ or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do [[model theory]]) if there exist at least one model for $T$ (in our universe). Two theories, $T_1$, $T_2$ are said to be __equivalent__ if they have the same models. 

Given a class $K$ of structures for $L$, there is a theory $Th(K)$ consisting of all sentences in $L$ which hold in every structure from $K$. Two structures $M$ and $N$ are __elementary equivalent__ (sometimes written by equality $M=N$, sometimes said "elementarily equivalent") if $Th(M)=Th(N)$, i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in $L$. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to $Th(K)$ is called a __set of axioms__ of $K$. A theory is said to be __finitely axiomatizable__ if there exist a finite set of axioms for $K$. 

A theory is said to be __complete__ if it is equivalent to $Th(M)$ for some structure $M$. 

#### Categorical point of view and models in topoi

From the categorical point of view, for every theory $T$ there exists a [[category]] $C_T$ -- the  **[[syntactic category]]** $C_T$ -- such that a model for $T$ is a [[functor]] $C_T \to \mathcal{T}$ into some [[topos]] $T$, satisfying certain conditions.

For instance the syntactic categories of [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] are precisely those categories that have finite cartesian [[product]]s and in which every object is [[isomorphic]] to a finite cartesian power $x^n$ of a distinguished object $x$. A model for a Lawvere theory is precisely a finite product preserving functor $C_T \to \mathcal{T}$.

We say a functor $\mathcal{T}_1 \to \mathcal{T}_2$ of toposes (for instance a [[logical morphism]] or a [[geometric morphism]]) _preserves a theory_ $T$ if for every model $C_T \to \mathcal{T}_1$ of $T$ in $\mathcal{T}_1$, the composite $C_T \to \mathcal{T}_1 \to \mathcal{T}_2$ is a model of $T$ in $\mathcal{T}_2$.

For instance, every [[geometric morphism]] preserves every [[Lawvere theory]] since, being a [[right adjoint]], it preserves [[limit]]s, hence finite products.
