## Idea

A _theory_ is a collection of _axioms_ in some [[logic]].

## Definition

There are several different viewpoint on theories:

* The 

  [syntactic view](#SyntacticView) 

  is that the theory itself consists of the set of formulas in the first order language $Lang(\Sigma)$ of a [[signature (in logic)|signature]] $\Sigma$ together with the set of logical consequences (aka theorems) of the axioms in $A$, relative to (some specified) fragment of [[first-order logic]]. 

* The 

  [semantic view](#SemanticView)

  is that the theory is given by the class of its [[model]]s appropriate to that fragment of logic. G&ouml;del's completeness theorem is that a sentence in $\mathcal{T}$ is a theorem iff it is satisfied in every model.  

* The 

  [categorical view](#CategoricalView) 

  is that the logical formalism of a theory $\mathcal{T}$ can frequently be embodied in a [[syntactic category]] of terms $C_{\mathcal{T}}$, so that models of a theory $\mathcal{T}$ are identified with [[functor]]s 

  $$C_{\mathcal{T}} \to Set$$ 

  that preserve some (typically [[stuff, structure, property|property-like]]) [[stuff, structure, property|structures]] on $C_{\mathcal{T}}$, such as certain classes of [[colimit]]s or of [[limits]], pertinent to the fragment of logic at hand. Then a completeness theorem would be the statement that the canonical map 

  $$C_{\mathcal{T}} \to \prod_{models F in Set} Set$$ 

  is a [[full and faithful functor|full faithful embedding]] (one that preserves all relevant logical structure). For this reason, completeness theorems are also known as _embedding theorems_.

Hm, is that the way it should be said?
=--

  In fact, the notion of model can be generalized away from $Set$ to more general  [[categories]], namely those that have enough structure to "internalize" the fragment of logic at hand. From this very general point of view on model, the syntactic category $C_{\mathcal{T}}$ is the generic or universal model for $\mathcal{T}$, and if we simply call $C_{\mathcal{T}}$ the theory, then models and theories are placed on the same footing. 

In this article we mostly consider the categorical view on "theory".

### Syntactic view

###### Definition

In first-order [[logic]], a **theory** $\mathcal{T}$ is presented by 

1. a [[signature (in logic)|signature]] $\Sigma$, specifying the allowed [[type]]s of variables and the [[function]]s and [[relation]]s between these;

1. a set $A$ of [[sequent]]s of [[formula]]s in this signature, called the **axioms** of the theory:  expressed in the first-order language $Lang(\Sigma)$ with equality generated by $\Sigma$

## Examples 

### Classes of theories

There are many different kinds of "theory" depending on the strength of the "logic": a by-no-means complete list includes 

* [[equational logic]], 

* [[Horn logic]], 

* [[essentially algebraic logic]], 

* [[geometric logic]], 

* [[regular logic]], 

* [[exact logic]], 

* [[extensive logic]], 

* [[coherent logic]], 

* [[first-order logic]] (aka pretopos logic), 

and corresponding theories for these logics. 


* [[essentially algebraic theory]]

* [[generalized algebraic theory]]

* [[algebraic theory]]

  * [[commutative algebraic theory]]

  * finitary algebraic theory: [[Lawvere theory]]

    * [[Fermat theory]]



#### Hierarchy of theories: cartesian, regular, coherent, geometric

There is a hierarchy of theories that can be interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of a hierarchy of types of [[categories]].  Since [[predicates]] in the internal logic are represented by [[subobjects]], in order to interpret any connective or quantifier in the internal logic, one needs a corresponding operation on subobjects to exist in the category in question, and be well-behaved.  For instance:

* **cartesian theories** Since $\wedge$ and $\top$ are represented by [[intersections]] and identities (top elements), these can be interpreted in any [[lex category]].  Theories involving only these are [[cartesian theory|cartesian theories]].

* **regular theories** Since $\exists$ is represented by the [[image]] of a subobject, it can be interpreted in any [[regular category]].  Theories involving only $\wedge$, $\top$, and $\exists$ are [[regular theory|regular theories]].

* **coherent theories** Since $\vee$ and $\bot$ are represented by [[union]] and [[bottom elements]], these can be interpreted in any [[coherent category]].  Theories which add these to regular logic are called [[coherent theory|coherent theories]].

* **geometric theories** Finally, theories which also involve infinitary $\bigvee$, which is again represented by an infinitary union, can be interpreted in [[infinitary coherent categories]], aka *[[geometric categories]]*.  These are **[[geometric theories]]**.

Note that the axioms of one of these theories are actually of the form
$$ \varphi \vdash_{\vec{x}} \psi $$
where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are formulas involving only the specified connectives and quantifiers, $\vdash$ means entailment, and $\vec{x}$ is a [[context]].  Such an axiom can also be written as
$$ \forall \vec{x}. (\varphi \Rightarrow \psi) $$
so that although $\Rightarrow$ and $\forall$ are not strictly part of any of the above logics, they can be applied "once at top level."  In an axiom of this form for geometric logic, the formulas $\varphi$ and $\psi$ which must be built out of $\top$, $\wedge$, $\bot$, $\bigvee$, and $\exists$ are sometimes called *positive* formulas.

### Abelian theories

Interestingly, one form of logic which made an early appearance but is not ordinarily thought of as logic at all is the logic of [[abelian categories]], which is characterized by certain exactness properties. Here a small abelian category $A$ can be thought of as a syntactic site for some "abelian theory"; models of the theory are exact additive functors with domain $A$. The classical models would in fact be exact additive functors $A \to Ab$, or exact additive functors to a category of modules. A "Freyd-Heron-Lubkin-Mitchell" embedding theorem is then a completeness theorem with respect to the classical models, and assures us that a statement in the language of abelian category theory is provable if and only if it is true when interpreted in any module category. 



### Specific examples

The simplest nontrivial theory is the

* [[theory of objects]]

* the theories 

  * $Th(Cat)$ of [[categories]]

  * $Th(Lex)$ of [[finitely complete categories]]

  * $Th(Topos)$ of [[elementary toposes]]

  * $Th(ETCS)$ of [[set]]s ([[ETCS]])

  are discussed at [[fully formal ETCS]].


## Models for a theory


From the categorical point of view, for every theory $T$ there exists a [[category]] $C_T$ -- the  **[[syntactic category]]** $C_T$ -- such that a model for $T$ is a [[functor]] $C_T \to \mathcal{T}$ into some [[topos]] $T$, satisfying certain conditions.

For instance the syntactic categories of [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] are precisely those categories that have finite cartesian [[product]]s and in which every object is [[isomorphic]] to a finite cartesian power $x^n$ of a distinguished object $x$. A model for a Lawvere theory is precisely a finite product preserving functor $C_T \to \mathcal{T}$.

We say a functor $\mathcal{T}_1 \to \mathcal{T}_2$ of toposes (for instance a [[logical morphism]] or a [[geometric morphism]]) _preserves a theory_ $T$ if for every model $C_T \to \mathcal{T}_1$ of $T$ in $\mathcal{T}_1$, the composite $C_T \to \mathcal{T}_1 \to \mathcal{T}_2$ is a model of $T$ in $\mathcal{T}_2$.

For instance, every [[geometric morphism]] preserves every [[Lawvere theory]] since, being a [[right adjoint]], it preserves [[limit]]s, hence finite products.
