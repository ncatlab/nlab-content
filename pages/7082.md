## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], the notion of **equivalence** is an internalization of the notion of [[equivalence]] or [[homotopy equivalence]].

These are sometimes called **[[weak equivalences]]**, but there is nothing [[weak equivalence|weak]] about them (in particular, they always have homotopy inverses). 


## Definition

We work in [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[type theory]] with [[dependent sums]], [[dependent products]], and [[identity types]].  

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $f\colon A\to B$ a [[term]] of [[function type]]; we define new [[dependent types]] as follows:

the [[homotopy fiber]]

$$
  f \colon A \to B, b\colon B \vdash hfiber(f,b) \coloneqq \sum_{a\colon A} (f(a) = b)
$$

and the [[proposition]] that the homotopy fiber is a (dependently) [[contractible type]]:

$$
  f \colon A \to B 
   \vdash 
   isEquiv(f) \coloneqq \prod_{b\colon B} isContr(hfiber(f,b))
  \,.
$$

We say $f$ is an **equivalence** if $isEquiv(f)$ is an [[inhabited type]].

=--

That is, a function is an equivalence if all of its [[homotopy fibers]] are [[contractible types]] (in a way which depends continuously on the base point).

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X, Y : Type$ two [[types]], the **type of equivalences** from $X$ to $Y$ is the [[dependent sum]]

$$
  Equiv(X,Y)
  =
  (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}Y)
  \coloneqq
  \sum_{f : (X \to Y)}
  isEquiv(f)
  \,.
$$

=--


Three variations of this definition are, informally:

* $f\colon A\to B$ is an equivalence if there is a map $g\colon B\to A$ and homotopies $p\colon \prod_{a\colon A} (g(f(a)) = a)$ and $q\colon \prod_{b\colon B} (f(g(b)) = b)$ (a **[[homotopy equivalence]]**)

* $f\colon A\to B$ is an equivalence if there is the above data, together with a higher homotopy expressing one [[triangle identity]] for $f$ and $g$ (an **[[adjoint equivalence]]**).

* $f\colon A\to B$ is an equivalence if there are maps $g,h\colon B\to A$ and homotopies $p\colon \prod_{a\colon A} (g(f(a)) = a)$ and $q\colon \prod_{b\colon B} (f(h(b)) = b)$ (sometimes called a **homotopy isomorphism**).

By formalizing these, we obtain types $homotopyEquiv(f)$, $isAdjointEquiv(f)$, and $isHIso(f)$.  All four of these types are co-inhabited: we have a function from any one of them to any of the others.  Moreover, at least if we assume [[function extensionality]], the types $isAdjointEquiv(f)$ and $isHIso(f)$ are themselves *equivalent* to $isEquiv(f)$, and all three are [[h-propositions]].

This is not true for $homotopyEquiv(f)$, which is not in general an h-prop even with function extensionality.  However, often the most convenient way to show that $f$ is an equivalence is by exhibiting a term in $homotopyEquiv(f)$ (although such a term could just as well be interpreted to lie in $isHIso(f)$ with $h\coloneqq g$).


## Semantics
 {#Semantics}

We discuss the [[categorical semantics]] of equivalences in homotopy type theory.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally cartesian closed category]] which is a [[model category]], in which the (acyclic cofibration, fibration) [[weak factorization system]] has [[stable path objects]], and acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations between fibrant objects.  (We ignore questions of coherence, which are not important for this discussion.) For instance $\mathcal{C}$ could be a [[type-theoretic model category]].

### Of $isEquiv(-)$

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $A, B$ to [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]]-[[fibrant objects]] in $\mathcal{C}$,
a morphism $f\colon A\to B$ is a [[weak equivalence]] or equivalently a [[homotopy equivalence]] in $\mathcal{C}$ precisely when the interpretation of $isEquiv(f)$ has a [[generalized element|global point]] $* \to isEquiv(f)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $f\colon A\to B$, the [[categorical semantics]] of the [[dependent type]]

$$
  b\colon B 
   \;\vdash\; 
  hfiber(f,b)\colon Type
$$ 

is by the rules for the [[categorical semantics|interpretation]] of [[identity types]] and [[substitution]]
the [[mapping path space]] construction $P f$, given by the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    [b : B \vdash  hfiber(f,b)] &\coloneqq & P f  &\to& A
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    && B^I &\to& B
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

which, by the [[factorization lemma]], is one way to factor $f$ as an [[acyclic cofibration]] followed by a [[fibration]]

$$
  f : A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} P f \to B
  \,.
$$

By definition and the semantics of [[contractible types]], therefore, if $A$ and $B$ are cofibrant, then $isEquiv(f)$ has a [[global element]] 

$$
  * \to \prod_{b} isContr(hfiber(f,b))
$$


precisely when in this factorization, the fibration $P f \to B$ is an acyclic fibration.  (See for instance ([Shulman, page 49](http://www.sandiego.edu/~shulman/hottminicourse2012/03models.pdf#page=49)) for more details.)


But by the [[2-out-of-3 property]], this is equivalent to $f$ being a weak equivalence --- and hence a homotopy equivalence, since it is a map between fibrant-cofibrant objects.

###### Remark

In the above we fixed one function $f : A \to X$. But the type $isEquiv$ is actually a [[dependent type]]

$$
  f : A \to B \vdash isEquiv(f)
$$

on the [[function type|type of all functions]]. To obtain the [[categorical semantics]] of this general dependent $isEquiv$-construction, first notice that the interpretation of

$f : A \to B,\; a : A,\; b : B \;\vdash\; (f(a) = b)  \colon Type$

is by the rules for interpretation of [[identity types]], [[evaluation]] and [[substitution]] the left vertical morphism in the [[pullback]] [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{  
    Q &\to&  B^I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    [A,B] \times A \times B &\stackrel{(eval, id_B)}{\to}& B \times B
  }
  \,,
$$

where $eval : [A, B] \times A \to B$ is the [[evaluation map]] for the [[internal hom]].
This means that the interpretation of further [[dependent sum]] yielding $hfib$

$$
  f : A \to B,\; b : B 
   \; \vdash \;  
  \left(
    \sum_{a : A } (f(a) = b) 
  \right)
  \colon Type
$$

is the composite left vertical morphism in

$$
  \array{  
    Q &\to& B^I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    [A,B] \times A \times B &\stackrel{(eval, id_B)}{\to}& B \times B
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{1,3}}}
    \\
    [A,B] \times B
  }
