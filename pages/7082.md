## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], the notion of **equivalence** is an internalization of the notion of [[equivalence]] or [[homotopy equivalence]].

These are sometimes called **[[weak equivalences]]**, but there is nothing [[weak equivalence|weak]] about them (in particular, they always have homotopy inverses). 


## Definition

We work in [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[type theory]] with [[dependent sums]], [[dependent products]], and [[identity types]].  

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $f\colon A\to B$ a [[term]] of [[function type]]; we define new types as follows:

$$b\colon B \vdash hfiber(f,b) \coloneqq \sum_{a\colon A} (f(a) = b)$$

$$isEquiv(f) \coloneqq \prod_{b\colon B} isContr(hfiber(f,b))$$

We say $f$ is an **equivalence** if $isEquiv(f)$ is an [[inhabited type]].

=--

That is, a function is an equivalence if all of its [[homotopy fibers]] are [[contractible types]] (in a way which depends continuously on the base point).

### Variations

Three variations are, informally:

* $f\colon A\to B$ is an equivalence if there is a map $g\colon B\to A$ and homotopies $p\colon \prod_{a\colon A} (g(f(a)) = a)$ and $q\colon \prod_{b\colon B} (f(g(b)) = b)$ (a **[[homotopy equivalence]]**)

* $f\colon A\to B$ is an equivalence if there is the above data, together with a higher homotopy expressing one [[triangle identity]] for $f$ and $g$ (an **[[adjoint equivalence]]**).

* $f\colon A\to B$ is an equivalence if there are maps $g,h\colon B\to A$ and homotopies $p\colon \prod_{a\colon A} (g(f(a)) = a)$ and $q\colon \prod_{b\colon B} (f(h(b)) = b)$ (sometimes called a **homotopy isomorphism**).

By formalizing these, we obtain types $homotopyEquiv(f)$, $isAdjointEquiv(f)$, and $isHIso(f)$.  All four of these types are co-inhabited: we have a function from any one of them to any of the others.  Moreover, at least if we assume [[function extensionality]], the types $isAdjointEquiv(f)$ and $isHIso(f)$ are themselves *equivalent* to $isEquiv(f)$, and all three are [[h-propositions]].

This is not true for $homotopyEquiv(f)$, which is not in general an h-prop even with function extensionality.  However, often the most convenient way to show that $f$ is an equivalence is by exhibiting a term in $homotopyEquiv(f)$ (although such a term could just as well be interpreted to lie in $isHIso(f)$ with $h\coloneqq g$).


## Semantics

We discuss the [[categorical semantics]] of equivalences in homotopy type theory.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally cartesian closed category]] which is a [[model category]], in which the (acyclic cofibration, fibration) [[weak factorization system]] has [[stable path objects]], and acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations between fibrant objects.  (We ignore questions of coherence, which are not important for this discussion.) For instance $\mathcal{C}$ could be a [[type-theoretic model category]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $A, B$ to [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]]-[[fibrant objects]] in $\mathcal{C}$,
a morphism $f\colon A\to B$ is a [[weak equivalence]] or equivalently a [[homotopy equivalence]] in $\mathcal{C}$ precisely when the interpretation of $isEquiv(f)$ has a [[generalized element|global point]] $* \to isEquiv(f)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Note that for $f\colon A\to B$, the dependent type
$$b\colon B \vdash hfiber(f,b)\colon Type$$
is precisely the [[mapping path space]] construction $P f$, which is one way to factor $f$ as an [[acyclic cofibration]] followed by a [[fibration]]

$$
  f : A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} P f \to B
  \,.
$$

By definition and the semantics of [[contractible types]], therefore, if $A$ and $B$ are cofibrant, then $isEquiv(f)$ has a [[global element]] precisely when in this factorization, the fibration $P f \to B$ is an acyclic fibration.  But by the [[2-out-of-3 property]], this is equivalent to $f$ being a weak equivalence --- and hence a homotopy equivalence, since it is a map between fibrant-cofibrant objects.
