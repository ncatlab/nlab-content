A __pointed space__, or __based space__, is a [[pointed object]] in a category of spaces.  That is, a pointed space is a space $X$ together with a point $a$ of $X$, called the __basepoint__, or __base point__, of the pointed space.  Here 'point' in general means [[global element]]; this matches the usual meaning of 'point' in all of the common categories of spaces, even non-[[concrete category|concrete]] ones like the category of [[locale]]s.

Many constructions in [[homotopy theory]], such as the [[fundamental group]] and other [[homotopy groups]], are defined on pointed spaces.  One can remove the dependence on a basepoint by passing to the [[fundamental groupoid]].
