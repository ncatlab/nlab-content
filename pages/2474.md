## Definition

A $C^*$-algebra is a complex [[Banach algebra]] over the [[complex numbers]] with an [[involution]] compatible with [[complex conjugation]] (that is a Banach $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]]) and such that the $C^*$-identity holds:

$$\| A^* A \| = \|A\|^2. $$

A [[representation of a C-star algebra]] is a *-homomorphism of an abstract $C^*$-algebra to the [[bounded operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]].

There are different concepts for the [[tensor product]] of $C^*-algebras$, see for example [[spatial tensor product]].

## In tersm of $\dagger$-compact categories {#DaggerFormulation}

The notion of $C^*$-algebra can be abstracted to the general context of [[symmetric monoidal †-categories]], which serves to illuminate their role in [[quantum mechanics in terms of †-compact categories]].

For a discussion of this in the finite-dimensional case see

* [[Jamie Vicary]], _Categorical formulation of quantum algebras_ ([arXiv:0805.0432](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0432))

## Properties

Every $C^*$-algebra can be realized (via the [[GNS construction]]) as a norm-closed $*$-subalgebra of the Banach $*$-algebra $B(H)=L(H,H)$ of bounded linear operators on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ with the induced norm.
