## Definitions

A $C^*$-algebra is a complex [[Banach algebra]] over the [[complex numbers]] with an [[involution]] compatible with [[complex conjugation]] (that is a Banach $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]]) that satisfies the $C^*$-identity
$$ {\|{A^* A}\|} = {\|{A^*}\|} {\|{A}\|} $$
or equivalently the $B^*$-identity
$$ {\|{A^* A}\|} = {\|{A}\|^2} .$$

There are different concepts for the [[tensor product]] of $C^*$-algebras, see for example [[spatial tensor product]].


### Concrete $C^*$-algebras

Given a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, a __[[concrete structure|concrete]] $C^*$-algebra__ on $H$ is a $*$-[[subalgebra]] of the algebra of [[bounded operators]] on $H$ that is [[closed subspace|closed]] in the [[norm topology]].  

Similarly, a __[[representation of a C-star algebra|representation]]__ of a $C^*$-algebra $A$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ is a $*$-homomorphism from $A$ to the algebra of [[bounded operators]] on $H$.

It is immediate that concrete $C^*$-algebras correspond precisely to [[faithful representation]]s of abstract $C^*$-algebras.  It is an important theorem that *every* $C^*$-algebra has a faithful representation; that is, every abstract $C^*$-algebra is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a concrete $C^*$-algebra.

The original definition of the term ‘$C^*$-algebra’ was in fact the concrete notion; the 'C' stood for 'closed'.  Furthermore, the original term for the abstract notion was ‘$B^*$-algebra’.  However, we now usually interpret ‘$C^*$-algebra’ abstractly.  (Compare ‘$W^*$-algebra’ and '[[von Neumann algebra]]'.)


### In $\dagger$-compact categories {#DaggerFormulation}

The notion of $C^*$-algebra can be abstracted to the general context of [[symmetric monoidal †-categories]], which serves to illuminate their role in [[quantum mechanics in terms of †-compact categories]].

For a discussion of this in the finite-dimensional case see

* [[Jamie Vicary]], _Categorical formulation of quantum algebras_ ([arXiv:0805.0432](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0432))


## Properties
 {#Properties}

See also [[operator algebras]].


### GNS construction

The [[GNS construction]] shows that every abstract $C^*$-algebra as a concrete $C^*$-algebra: a subalgebra of an algebra of [[bounded operator]]s on some [[Hilbert space]].


### Gelfand duality

[[Gelfand duality]] says that every (unital) _commutative_ $C^*$-algebra is that of [[continuous functions]] on some [[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological space]]: there is an [[equivalence of categories]] $C^* Alg_{com} \simeq $ [[Top]]${}_{cpt}$.

###### Proposition

For $A$ and $B$ two $C^\ast$-algebras and $f : A \to B$
a [[star-algebra]] [[homomorphism]] the set-theoretic [[image]]
$f(A) \subset B$ is a $C^\ast$-subalgebra of $B$, hence is also the 
[[image]] of $f$ in $C^\ast Alg$.

This is ([KadisonRingrose, theorem 4.1.9](#KadisonRingrose)).

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

There is a [[functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{C} : C^\ast Alg \to Poset
$$

to the [[category]] [[Poset]] of [[posets]], which sends each $A \in C^\ast Alg$
to its [[poset of commutative subalgebras]] $\mathcal{C}(A)$ 
and sends each morphism $f : A \to B$ to the [[functor]]
$\mathcal{C}(f) : \mathcal{C}(A) \to \mathcal{C}(B)$ which
sends a commutative subalgebra $C \subset A$ to $f(C) \subset B$.

### Homotopy theory

There is [[homotopy theory]] of $C^\ast$-algebras, being a non-commutative generalization of that of [[Top]]. See for instance ([Uuye 12](#Uuye)).


## Variants

$C^*$-algebras equipped with the [[action]] of a [[group]] by [[automorphisms]] of the algebra are called _[[C-star-systems]]_ .


## Examples

* [[matrix]] algebras;

* [[uniformly hyperfinite algebra]]

* [[von Neumann algebra]]


## Related concepts

* [[C-star coalgebra]]

* [[state on an operator algebra]]

* [[von Neumann algebra]], 

* [[AQFT]]
