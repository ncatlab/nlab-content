## Definition

The [[formal group]]  of the [[multiplicative group]] .

Its formal group law $f(x,y) \in R[ [x,y] ]$ is

$$
  f(x,y) = x + y + x y
  \,,
$$

## Examples

The formal group law of [[topological K-theory]] which is induced by its canonical [[complex oriented cohomology|complex orientation]] is the multiplicative formal group law. See at _[[topological K-theory]]_ the section _[Complex orientation and Formal group law](topological+K-theory#ComplexOrientationAndFormalGroupLaw)_
