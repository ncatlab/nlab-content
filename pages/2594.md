The axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] are intended to pin down the minimum [[category theory|abstract nonsense]] necessary for talking about the _differential_ aspect of [[differential geometry]] using concrete objects that model [[infinitesimal space]]s.

But the typical _models_ for the axioms -- the typical [[smooth topos]]es -- are constructed in close analogy to the general mechanism of [[algebraic geometry]]: [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|well-adapted models]] for [[smooth topos]]es use [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $C^\infty Ring^{op}$ (the [[opposite category]] of [[generalized smooth algebra|smooth algebra]]s) where spaces in [[algebraic geometry]] (such as [[scheme]]s) uses [[sheaf|sheaves]] on [[CRing]]${}^{op}$.

In fact, for instance also the [[topos]] of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on $k-Alg^{op}$, which one may think of as being a context in which much of [[algebraic geometry]] over a [[field]] $k$ takes place, happens to satisfy the axioms of a [[smooth topos]] (see the examples there).

This raises the question:

**Questions**

To which degree do results in [[algebraic geometry]] depend on the choice of [[site]] [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ or similar?

To which degree are these results valid in a much wider context of any [[smooth topos]], or smooth topos with certain extra assumptions?

It is curious that the field of algebraic geometry has induced, first with [[Alexander Grothendieck]] now with [[Jacob Lurie]], so much [[category theory]] and [[higher category theory]], while at the same time it is common practice in this field to effectively disregard one of the major guidelines that practitioners in pure [[category theory]] are fond of adhering to: that of separation of context and implementation. [[Bill Lawvere]]'s famous dichotomy between _theory_ and _model_ .

In fact, it seems that [[Lawvere]] dreamed up the axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] not without the idea of capturing central structures in [[algebraic geometry]] this way, too. But, possibly due to the very term chosen, [[synthetic differential geometry]] it has apparently always (if at all) attracted more the attention of those interested in ordinary [[differential geometry]] than those interested in [[algebraic geometry]].

But at least in the light of [[Jacob Lurie|Lurie]]'s notion of [[structured (âˆž,1)-topos]]es and [[generalized scheme]]s, from the point of which ordinary [[algebraic geometry]] as well as [[derived algebraic geometry]] is just one realization of a more general concept of geometry, it seems to be worthwhile to reexamine the wealth of knowledge accumulated in algebraic geometry and see how much of it depends on just general context, how much on concrete implementation.

**Questions**

1. To which degree can the notion of [[quasicoherent sheaf]] generalize from a context modeled on the [[site]] [[CRing]] to a more general context. What is, for instance, a quasicoherent sheaf on a [[derived smooth manifold]]? If at all? What on a general [[generalized scheme]], if at all?
