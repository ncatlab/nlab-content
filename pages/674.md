###### Definition

An [[object]] $U$ in a [[category]] $C$ is **subterminal** if any two [[morphism]]s with [[target]] $U$ but the same source are equal.  In other words, $U$ is subterminal if for any object $X$, there is at most one morphism $X\to U$.

###### Definition


An __[[umbrella category]]__ is a nonempty category $C$ such that for every object $X$ in $C$, there is at least one subterminal object $T$ such that $C(X,T)$ is nonempty (hence being a singleton).

## Properties

If $C$ has a [[terminal object]] $1$, then $U$ is subterminal precisely if the unique morphism $U \to 1$ is [[monomorphism|monic]]; hence the name "sub-terminal."  

If the [[product]] $U \times U$ exists, it is equivalent to saying that the  [[diagonal]] $U \to U \times U$ is an [[isomorphism]].

## Examples

The subterminal objects in a [[topos]] can be viewed as its "external [[truth value]]s."  For example, in the topos $Sh(X)$ of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on a [[topological space]] $X$, the subterminal objects are precisely the open sets in $X$.
