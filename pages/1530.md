The Erlangen program (in German, erlanger Programm) is a project, begun by [[Felix Klein]] at Erlangen in the 19th century, to study [[geometry]] from the perspective of [[group theory]]. See [[Klein geometry]].  It was published in 1872 as _Vergleichende Betrachtungen &uuml;ber neuere geometrische Forschungen_, translated by M. W. Haskell as _A Comparative Review of Recent Researches in Geometry_. Elements of Klein geometry are recently being generalized fropm groups to [[groupoid]]s and even [[category|categories]] or $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]].
