## Idea

The _Erlangen program_ (in German, _erlanger Programm_ ) is a project, begun by [[Felix Klein]] at Erlangen in the 19th century, to study [[geometry]] from the perspective of [[group theory]]. The idea is to take the elementary building blocks of geometry to be not just [[Euclidean space]]s but more generally [[homogeneous space]]s. These have then also been called _[[Klein geometries]]_ .

It was published in 1872 as _Vergleichende Betrachtungen &uuml;ber neuere geometrische Forschungen_, translated by M. W. Haskell as _A Comparative Review of Recent Researches in Geometry_. 

Elements of Klein geometry are recently being generalized fropm groups to [[groupoid]]s and even [[category|categories]] or $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]]. See [[higher Klein geometry]].
