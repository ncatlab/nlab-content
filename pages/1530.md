The Erlangen program (in German, erlanger Programm) is a project, begun by Felix Klein at Erlangen in the 19th century, to study [[geometry]] from the perspective of [[group theory]].  It was published in 1872 as _Vergleichende Betrachtungen &uuml;ber neuere geometrische Forschungen_, translated by M. W. Haskell as _A Comparative Review of Recent Researches in Geometry_. We now use [[groupoid]]s and even [[category|categories]] or $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]].
