
A _pair_ is usually an [[n-tuple]] for $n = 2$, that is an _[[ordered pair]]_.  Such a pair is a [[term]] of [[product type]], an [[element]] of a [[Cartesian product]], a [[generalized element]] of a [[product|product object]], etc.

But a _pair_ may also be an _[[unordered pair]]_.  The existence of these is a basic axiom of [[ZFC]] and its variations, the [[axiom of pairing]].
