A special square array of [[Lie algebras]]/[[Lie groups]] labeled by pairs of [[normed division algebras]] and including all the [[exceptional Lie groups]] except [[G2]]. Three constructions give this square, namely, the Tits construction, the Vinberg construction and the triality construction (see [BaezMagic](#BaezMagic)).

[[Michael Atiyah]] ([AtiyahMagic](#AtiyahMagic)) has proposed using the magic square to explain the [[Kervaire invariant problem]] similarly to how the existence of the four normed division algebras explains the [[Hopf invariant one]] problem.

## Extensions

* Several mathematicians have constructed a larger triangle of Lie groups, known as the [[magic triangle]], which contains the magic square. 

* [[Michael Duff]] and colleagues ([ABDHN](#ABDHN)) have proposed a magic _pyramid_ whose base is the magic square.

* [[Bruce Westbury]] ([Westbury](#Westbury)) has proposed an extension to a $5 \times 5$-square with the new row and column indexed by the [[sextonion|sextonions]].
