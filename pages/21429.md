## Idea

Kripke's schema is a principle found in the school of Brouwer, going beyond base constructive/intuitionistic logic. It ties predicates (or, in some formulations, membership of subsets of the naturals) to the values of infinite sequences. 

KS:
For every statement P, there exists a binary sequence A, such that P holds iff there is some n such that A(n) equals 1.

This implies the following Weak Principle of Finite Possibility, which can be stated just in terms of sequences:

WPFP:
For every binary sequence B, there exists a binary sequence A, such that B is the zero sequence iff A is not the zero sequence.

It can be shown that (MP + WPFP) iff LPO. Those principles are thus not provable in Russian constructivism.

Indeed, formulations of it contradict the so called Constructive Church's Thesis. KS is equivalent to the claim that every inhabited subset of the naturals is countable. It also has implications for metric spaces.
