## Idea

The **Euler-Lagrange [[equations]]** of a [[nonlinear functional]] characterize in [[variational calculus]] the _[[extrema]]_ of that functional, hence its _[[critical locus]]_. 

This originates from and is mainly used in [[physics]], where the functional in question is the _[[action functional]]_ of a [[physical system]], and where its critical points encode the physically observable [[particle]] [[trajectories]] and [[field (physics)|field]] configurations by the _[[principle of extremal action]]_.

## Details 

Given a [[Lagrangian]] $L = L(q,\stackrel{\cdot}q,t)$ of a [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical]] system the corresponding [[action principle]] can be expressed as **Euler-Lagrange equations**: for all $i$, 

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \stackrel{\cdot}{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}_i}  = 0
$$

If there is only one degree of freedom then one talks in singular: Euler-Lagrange equation. 

Unlike in the usual [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical]] systems, in some other problems of [[calculus of variations]] one has Lagrangians involving higher time derivatives; the Euler-Lagrange equations have then correspondingly more terms. Similarly, one can have dependence on more parameters than a single time parameter, what can also be easily incorporated. 

## Examples

* The Euler-Lagrange equations of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] are [[Einstein's equations]] of [[gravity]].

* [[Maxwell's equations]]

* [[Yang-Mills equations]]
