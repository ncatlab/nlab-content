## Idea

In suitable "[[coordinate-free spectrum|coordinate-free]]" presentations of [[spectra]], the structure of a ([[commutative monoid|commutative]]) [[monoid]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]] (an [[A-infinity ring]] ([[E-infinity ring]])) may be expressed directly as a [[lax monoidal functor]] on the indexing spaces, hence a functor that intertwines the [[smash product]] of indexing spaces with that of the component spaces, but without explicitly mentioning the [[smash product of spectra]].

I.e. a _functor with smash products_ is a suitably well behaved functor

$$
  E \;\colon\; \mathcal{D} \longrightarrow Spaces^{\ast/}
$$

from a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{D},\wedge)$ equipped with [[natural transformations]] 

$$
  \mathbb{S}(V) \longrightarrow E(V)
$$

$$
  E(V) \wedge E(W) \longrightarrow E(V \wedge W)
$$

that are [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]] in the evident sense.

## Implementations

### For highly structured spectra

For the case of [[highly structured spectra]] such as [[orthogonal spectra]], [[symmetric spectra]] and [[S-modules]], the equivalence of FSPs with monoids with respect to the [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] is discussed in ([MMSS 00, prop. 22.1, prop. 22.6](#MMSS00)).

(For instance accounts such as ([Kochmann 96, section 3.3](Adams+category#Kochmann96),  [Schwede 14](orthogonal%20spectrum#Schwede14)) follow this perspective and define [[ring spectra]] first as FSPs, before or introducing the smash product on spectra)

### For excisive functor

For the monoidal [[model structure]] for excisive functors, the fact that monoids with respect to the [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] are equivalently FSPs is discussed in ([Lydakis 98, remark 5.12](#Lydakis98)).

## Examples

* The [[ring spectrum]]-structure on [[Thom spectra]] naturally arises in FSP-form, see _[Thom spectrum -- Properties -- Ring spectrum structure](Thom+spectrum#RingSpectrumStructure)_.

## Reference

The concept was introduced (before [[symmetric smash products of spectra]] had been found) in

* {#Bökstedt86} [[Marcel Bökstedt]], _Topological Hochschild homology_. Preprint, Bielefeld, 1986

A systematic account is in 

* {#MMSS00} [[Michael Mandell]], [[Peter May]], [[Stefan Schwede]], [[Brooke Shipley]], part III of _Model Categories of Diagram Spectra_, Proceedings London Mathematical Society Volume 82, Issue 2, 2000 ([pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/PAPERS/mmssLMSDec30.pdf), [publisher](http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/82/2/441.short?rss=1&ssource=mfc))

In the [[model structure for excisive functors]] the concept was recovered in
