Let $f$ be a [[differentiable function]] and let $x$ in its [[domain]] be a point where its [[derivative]] / [[Jacobian]] vanishes. Let $H_x(F)$ be the [[Hessian matrix]] of the function. Then

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[positive definite form]], then $x$ is called a **strict local minimum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[positive semidefinite form]], then $x$ is called a **local minimum**;


* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[negative definite form]], then $x$ is called a **strict local maximum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[negative semidefinite form]], then $x$ is called a **local maximum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is an [[indefinite form]], then $x$ is called a **nondegenerate saddle point**.
