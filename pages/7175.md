## Idea

In general, a __maximum__ is a [[top element]], a __minimum__ is a [[bottom element]], and an __extremum__ is either.  However, these terms are typically used in an [[analysis|analytic]] context where the [[order theory|order-theoretic]] aspects are secondary.  One also usually speaks of extrema of a [[function]], meaning a top or bottom element of the [[range]] of the function under its induced order as a [[subset]] of an ordered codomain.


## Local extrema of differentiable functions

In [[analysis]] one considers _local_ extrema of functions.

Let $f$ be a [[differentiable function]] and let $x$ in its [[domain]] be a [[critical point]], a point where its [[derivative]] / [[Jacobian]] vanishes. Let $H_x(F)$ be the [[Hessian matrix]] of the function. Then

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[positive definite form]], then $x$ is called a **strict local minimum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[positive semidefinite form]], then $x$ is called a **local minimum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[negative definite form]], then $x$ is called a **strict local maximum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is a [[negative semidefinite form]], then $x$ is called a **local maximum**;

* if $H_x(f)$ is an [[indefinite form]], then $x$ is called a **nondegenerate saddle point**.
