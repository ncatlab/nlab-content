## Idea

In general, a __maximum__ is a [[top element]], a __minimum__ is a [[bottom element]], and an __extremum__ is either.  However, these terms are typically used in [[analysis]], where the [[order theory]] is secondary.  One also usually speaks of extrema of a [[function]], meaning a top or bottom element of the [[range]] of the function under its induced order as a [[subset]] of an ordered codomain.  In this context, one also considers *local* extrema of functions; a __local extremum__ of $f$ is an extremum of a [[restriction]] of $f$ to an [[open subspace]] of its original domain.


## Local extrema of differentiable functions

Let $f$ be a twice-[[differentiable function]] and let $x$ in its [[domain]] be a [[critical point]], a point where its [[derivative]] / [[Jacobian]] vanishes. Let $H_x(F)$ be the [[Hessian matrix]] of the function. 

* for $x$ to be a **strict local minimum**, it is sufficient that  $H_x(f)$ is a [[positive definite form]];

* for $x$ to be a **local minimum**, it is sufficient that $H_x(f)$ is a [[positive semidefinite form]];

* for $x$ to be a **strict local maximum**, it is sufficient that $H_x(f)$ is a [[negative definite form]];

* for $x$ to be a **local maximum**, it is sufficient that $H_x(f)$ is a [[negative semidefinite form]];

* for $x$ to be a **nondegenerate saddle point**, it is sufficient that $H_x(f)$ is an [[indefinite form]] in a strict sense (?). A saddle point is not a local extremum but is a critical point.
