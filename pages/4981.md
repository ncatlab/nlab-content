## Definition

An [[object]] in a [[category]] with a given property is **essentially unique** with this property if it is [[isomorphic]] to any other object with that property.

## Examples

An object that is the [[limit]] or [[colimit]] over a given diagram is essentially unique. There is a _unique_ isomorphism to any other limiting (colimit) object.
