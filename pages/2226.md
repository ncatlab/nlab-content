A __sign relation__ is a special type of [[triadic relation]] that arises in the use of signs to connote meanings and denote objects.  If this sounds reminiscent of what we do in applying logic and reasoning to the world, actual and ideal, it is no accident.  Indeed, the polymathematician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] famously defined _logic_ as "formal semiotic", that is, the formal theory of signs.

## History ##

It is possible to trace the idea of a triadic sign relation back to hints in Plato and what we know of the Stoics, but one of the most detailed early formulations is found in this passage by Aristotle:

: Words spoken are symbols or signs $(\sigma\upsilon\mu\beta{o}\lambda\alpha)$ of affections or impressions $(\pi\alpha\theta\eta\mu\alpha\tau\alpha)$ of the soul $(\psi\upsilon\chi\eta)$;  written words are the signs of words spoken.  As writing, so also is speech not the same for all races of men.  But the mental affections themselves, of which these words are primarily signs $(\sigma\eta\mu\epsilon\iota\alpha)$, are the same for the whole of mankind, as are also the objects $(\pi\rho\alpha\gamma\mu\alpha\tau\alpha)$ of which those affections are representations or likenesses, images, copies $({o}\mu{o}\iota\omega\mu\alpha\tau\alpha)$.  (Aristotle, _De Interpretatione_, $1.16^{a}4$).

## Definition ##

A definition of sign relations that is explicit enough to support the development of a formal theory was given by C.S. Peirce in the process of defining logic, and so it is informative to view it in that context.

: Logic will here be defined as _formal semiotic_.  A definition of a sign will be given which no more refers to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place which a particle occupies, part by part, during a lapse of time.  Namely, a sign is something, $A$, which brings something, $B$, its _interpretant_ sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, $C$, its _object_, as that in which itself stands to $C$.  It is from this definition, together with a definition of "formal", that I deduce mathematically the principles of logic.  I also make a historical review of all the definitions and conceptions of logic, and show, not merely that my definition is no novelty, but that my non-psychological conception of logic has _virtually_ been quite generally held, though not generally recognized.  (Peirce, NEM 4, 20--21).
