A _shrinkable map_ $p:X \to Y$ in the category [[Top]] is a map with a section $s:Y \to X$ such that $s\circ p:X \to X$ is vertically homotopic to $id_X$ (i.e. is homotopic to $\id_X$ in the slice category $Top/Y$). In particular, a shrinkable map is a homotopy equivalence. This definition is due to Dold, in his 1963 _Annals_ paper _Partitions of unity in the theory of fibrations_.

**Example:**(Segal) Let $U_i \to Y$ be a [[numerable open cover]]. Then the [[geometric realization]] of the [[Cech nerve]] $N\check{C}(U_i)$ comes with a canonical map $|N\check{C}(U_i)| \to Y$ which is shrinkable.

There are extensions of this to other categories with a notion of homotopy.
