## Definition

In [[Riemannian geometry]], the **divergence** of a 
[[vector field]] $X$ over a [[Riemannian manifold]] $(M,g)$ is the real valued [[smooth function]] $div(X)$ defined by

$$
  div(X) = \star_g^{-1} d_{dR} \star_g g(X)
,$$

where $\star_g$ is the [[Hodge star]] operator of $(M,g)$,

$$
\star_g\colon \Omega^i(M;\mathbb{R}) \to \Omega^{dim M-i}(M;\mathbb{R})
,$$

and $d_{dR}$ is the [[de Rham differential]].

Alternatively, the divergence of a vector field $\mathcal{A}$ in some point $x\in M$ is calculated (or alternatively defined) by the integral formula 

$$
div \vec\mathcal{A} = lim_{vol D\to 0} \frac{1}{vol D} \oint_{\partial D} \vec{n}\cdot \vec\mathcal{A} d S
$$

where $D$ runs over the domains with smooth boundary $\partial D$ containing point $x$ and $\vec{n}$ is the unit vector of outer normal to the surface $S$. The formula does not depend on the shape of boundaries taken in limiting process, so one can typically take a coordinate chart and balls with decreasing radius in this particular coordinate chart. 

Although an [[orientation]] is required for the usual notion of Hodge star as given above, we may take it as valued in [[pseudoforms]] to show that the orientation (or even orientability) of $M$ is irrelevant (since the Hodge star is applied twice, returning us to untwisted forms). The metric is hidden in the volume form and in the "dot product". 


## Example

If $(M,g)$ is the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the canonical Euclidean metric, then the divergence of a vector field $X^i \partial_i$ is

$$
div(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^i}
.$$


## Remarks

The divergence was first developed in [[quaternion]] analysis, where its opposite appeared most naturally, called the _convergence_ $con(X) = - div(X)$.  In many applications of the divergence to the successor field, classical [[vector analysis]], the metric is irrelevant and we may use [[differential forms]] instead: we translate a vector field $X$ into the $(n-1)$-form $\star_g g(X)$ and a scalar field $f$ into the $n$-form $\star_g f$, so that the divergence *is* simply the [[de Rham differential]], and simply use the differential forms from the start.
