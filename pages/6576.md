[[!redirects left invariant differential form]]

A [[differential form]] on a [[Lie group]] $\omega \in \Omega^1(G)$ is called **left invariant** if for every $g \in G$ it is invariant under the left [[action]] of $G$ on itself

$g^* \omega = \omega$.

Analogously a form is **right invariant** if it is invariant under right multiplication.
