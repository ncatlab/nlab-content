## Idea


## Definition

Let $T$ be a [[dg-category]]. The **derived (infinity,1)-category** of $T$, denoted $D(T)$ is the [[(infinity,1)-categorical localization]] of the category of [[dg-modules]] over $T$ at the class of objectwise [[quasi-isomorphisms]].

The **derived dg-category** of $T$ is the [[dg-category]] presented by the projective [[dg-model structure on dg-modules]].

## Properties

$D(T)$ is a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] or [[pretriangulated dg-category]].

The [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by the [[representable presheaves]] is denoted $tri(A) \subset D(A)$, and the [[thick subcategory|thick]] [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by the [[representable presheaves]] is denoted $perf(A) \subset D(A)$.  It coincides with the [[full subcategory]] of [[compact objects]] of $D(A)$.
