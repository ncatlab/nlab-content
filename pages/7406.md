## Definition

Let $C$ be [[coherent category]]. Write $\tau C$ for the [[full subcategory]] of its category of [[filters]] on the [[prime filters]]. Jet $J_p$ be the [[Grothendieck topology]] on $\tau C$ induced from the [[coherent topology]] on the category of filters. 

The **topos of types** $T(C)$ of $C$ is the [[sheaf topos]]

$$
  T(C) := Sh_{J_p}(\tau C)
  \,.
$$

([Makkai](#Makkai)).

## Properties

### In terms of the coherent hyperdoctrine

Let $C$ be a [[coherent category]]. Its [[coherent hyperdoctrine]] $S_C^\delta$ is naturally an [[internal locale]] in the [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op}, Set]$ (as well as in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh_{coh}(C)$ for the [[coherent topology]] on $C$).

The topos of types is equivalent to the topos of internal sheaves over this [[internal locale]].

This is due to ([Coumans](#Coumans)).
