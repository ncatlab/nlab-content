## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[coherent category]].  Write $\tau C$ for the category whose objects are pairs $(X,F)$ where $X$ is an object of $C$ and $F$ is a [[prime filter]] on $Sub_C(X)$.  This is the full subcategory of the [[category of filters]] of $C$ spanned by the prime filters.  Jet $J_p$ be the [[Grothendieck topology]] on $\tau C$ induced from the [[coherent topology]] on the category of filters. 

As defined by [Makkai](#Makkai), the **topos of types** $T(C)$ of $C$ is the [[sheaf topos]]

$$
  T(C) := Sh_{J_p}(\tau C)
  \,.
$$

**Note:** The word "types" here has nothing to do with [[type theory]].  Instead, it is apparently a reference to the notion of [type in model theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_%28model_theory%29)

## Properties

### In terms of the coherent hyperdoctrine

Let $C$ be a [[coherent category]]. Its [[coherent hyperdoctrine]] $S_C^\delta$ is naturally an [[internal locale]] in the [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op}, Set]$ (as well as in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh_{coh}(C)$ for the [[coherent topology]] on $C$).

The topos of types is equivalent to the topos of internal sheaves over this [[internal locale]].

This is due to ([Coumans](#Coumans)).
