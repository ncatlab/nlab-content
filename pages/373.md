## Idea


The notion of a _2-category_ generalizes that of [[category]]: a 2-category is a [[higher category theory|higher category]], where on top of the objects and morphisms, there are also 2-morphisms.

A 2-category consists of 

* [[objects]];

* 1-[[morphisms]] between objects;

* [[2-morphisms]] between morphisms.

The morphisms can be [[composition|composed]] along the objects, while the 2-morphisms can be composed in two different directions: along objects -- called [[vertical composition]] -- and along morphisms -- called [[horizontal composition]].  The composition of morphisms is allowed to be associative only up to [[coherent]] [[associator]] 2-morphisms.

2-Categories are also a [[horizontal categorification]] of [[monoidal categories]]: they are like monoidal categories with many objects. 

2-Categories provide the context for discussing

* [[adjunction]]s;

* [[monad]]s.

The concept of 2-category generalizes further in [[higher category theory]] to [[n-categories],] which have [[k-morphism]]s for all $k\le n$.


## Definitions

### Strict 2-catgeories

The easiest definition of 2-category is that it is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[cartesian monoidal category]] [[Cat]].  Thus it has a collection of objects, and for each pair of objects a category $hom(x,y)$.  The objects of these hom-categories are the morphisms, and the morphisms of these hom-categories are the 2-morphisms.  This produces the classical notion of [[strict 2-category]].

### General 2-categories

For some purposes, strict 2-categories are too strict: one would like to allow composition of morphisms to be associative and unital only up to coherent invertible 2-morphisms.  A direct generalization of the above "enriched" definition produces the classical notion of [[bicategory]].

One can also obtain notions of 2-category by specialization from the case of higher categories.  Specifically, if we fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict we wish, then we can define a __$2$-category__ to be an $\infty$-category such that every 3-morphism is an [[equivalence]], and all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j \geq 3$.  It follows that, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $2$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $2$-morphisms are equivalent.  In some models of $\infty$-categories, it is possible to make this precise by demanding that all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are actually *equal* for $j\geq 3$, producing a simpler notion of 2-category in which we can speak about [[equality]] of 2-morphisms instead of equivalence.  (This is the case for both strict $2$-categories and bicategories.)

All of the above definitions produce "equivalent" theories of 2-category, although in some cases (such as the fact that every bicategory is equivalent to a strict 2-category) this requires some work to prove.  On the nLab, we often use the word "2-category" in the general sense of referring to whatever model one may prefer, but usually one in which composition is weak; a [[bicategory]] is an adequate definition.  One should beware, however, that in the literature it is common for "2-category" to refer only to *strict* 2-categories.

A 2-category in which all 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms are invertible is a [[2-groupoid]].

## Examples

* The archetypical 2-category is [[Cat]], the 2-category whose

  * objects are [[categories]];

  * morphisms are [[functor]]s;

  * 2-morphisms are [[natural transformation]];

    vertical composition of 2-morphisms is the [[Godement product]].

  This happens to be a [[strict 2-category]].

* More generally, for $V$ any enriching category (such as a Benabou [[cosmos]]), there is a 2-category $V Cat$ whose

  * objects are $V$-[[enriched categories]];
  * morphsims ane $V$-enriched functors; and
  * 2-morphisms are $V$-natural transformations.

* On the other hand, for any such $V$ we also have a bicategory $V$-[[Prof]] whose

  * objects are $V$-[[enriched categories]];
  * morphisms are $V$-[[profunctor]]s; and
  * 2-morphisms are natural transformations between these.

* If $C$ is a category with [[pullbacks]], then there is a bicategory $Span(C)$ whose

  * objects are the objects of $C$;
  * morphisms are [[spans]] in $C$; and
  * 2-morphisms are morphisms of spans.

* Every [[monoidal category]] $C$ may be thought of as a [[bicategory]] $\mathbf{B}C$ (its [[delooping]]). This has

  * a single object $\bullet$;

  * morphisms are the objects of $C$: $(\mathbf{B}C)_1 = C_0$;

  * 2-morphisms are the morphisms of $C$ : $(\mathbf{B}C)_2 = C_1$;

  [[horizontal composition]] in $\mathbf{B}C$ is the [[tensor product]] in $C$ and [[vertical composition]] in $\mathbf{B}C$ is composition in $C$.

  Conversely, every 2-category with a single object comes from a monoidal category this way, so the concepts are effectively equivalent. (Precisely: the 2-category of  _pointed_ 2-categories with a single object is equivalent to that of monoidal categories).  For more on this relation see [[delooping hypothesis]], [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]], and [[periodic table]].

* Every [[2-groupoid]] is a 2-category. For instance

  * for $A$ any [[abelian group]], the double [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}^2 A$ is the strict 2-category with a single object, a single 1-morphisms, set of 2-moprhisms being $A$ and both horizontal composition as well as [[vertical composition]] being the product in $A$.

  * for $G$ any [[2-group]], its single [[delooping]] is a 2-groupoid with a single object.

* Every [[topological space]] has a [[path 2-groupoid]].

* Every [[(âˆž,2)-category]] has a **homotopy 2-category**, obtained by dividing out all 3-morphisms and higher.

## Properties

### Double nerve

An ordinary  [[category]] has a [[nerve]] which is a [[simplicial set]]. For 2-categories one may consider their [[double nerve]] which is a [[bisimplicial set]].

There is also a 2-nerve. ([LackPaoli](#LackPaoli))
