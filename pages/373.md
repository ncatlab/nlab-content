## Idea ##

A $2$-category is any of several concepts that generalize [[category|categories]] one step in [[higher category theory]]. 

It consists of 

* [[objects]];

* [[morphisms]] between objects;

* [[2-morphisms]] between morphisms.


The original notion is that of a globular [[strict 2-category]], but the one most often used here is that of a [[bicategory]]. The concept generalizes to $n$-[[n-category|categories]].

## Definition ##

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$2$-category__ is an $\infty$-category such that every 3-morphism is an [[equivalence]], and all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j \geq 3$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $2$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $2$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition may give a concept more general than your preferred definition of $2$-category, but it will be equivalent; basically, you may have to rephrase equivalence of $2$-morphisms as [[equality]].

## Specific versions ##

* globular [[strict 2-category]]
* [[bicategory]]

## Double nerve ##

An ordinary  [[category]] has a [[nerve]] which is a [[simplicial set]]. For 2-categories one may consider their [[double nerve]] which is a [[bisimplicial set]].
