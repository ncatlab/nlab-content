## Idea ##

The _Eilenberg-Zilber operad_ $\mathcal{Z}_k$ is the [[endomorphism operad]] of the [[chain complex]] of chains on the standard $k$-[[simplex]].

By the method of [[acyclic model]]s by Eilenberg and Zilber, one shows that $\mathbb{Z}(\infty)$ is an [[E-k operad|E-âˆž operad]] (therefore the name).

## Applications ##

* The [[cochains on simplicial sets]] are naturally [[algebra over an operad|algebras over]] $\mathcal{Z}(\infty)$.
