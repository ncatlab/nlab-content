A $3$-category is any of several concepts that generalize $2$-[[2-category|categories]] one step in [[higher category theory]]. The original notion is that of a globular [[strict 3-category]], but the one most often used here is that of a [[tricategory]]. The concept generalizes to $n$-[[n-category|categories]].

# Definition

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$3$-category__ is an $\infty$-category such that every 4-morphism is an [[equivalence]], and all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j \geq 4$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $3$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $3$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition may give a concept more general than your preferred definition of $3$-category, but it will be equivalent; basically, you may have to rephrase equivalence of $3$-morphisms as [[equality]].
