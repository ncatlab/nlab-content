## Idea and Definition 

[[Leonhard Euler]] solved the problem of finding a function of a continuous variable $x$ which for integer values of $x=n$ agrees with the factoriel function $n\mapsto n!$. In fact, gamma function is a shift by one of the solution of this problem.

For a complex variable $x\neq -1,-2,\ldots$, we define $\Gamma(x)$ by the formula 

$$
\Gamma(x) = \lim_{k\to \infty} \frac{k! k^{x-1}}{(x)_k}
$$

where $(x)_0 =1$ and for positive integer $k = 1,2,\ldots$,

$$
(x)_k = x (x+1) (x+2)\cdots (x+ k-1)
$$

is the "Pochhammer symbol" (or rising factorial). It easily follows that $\Gamma(n+1) = n!$ for natural numbers $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. 

## Properties 

As a function of a complex variable, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ is a [[meromorphic function]] with simple poles at $x = 0, -1, -2, \ldots$. 

Extending the recursive definition of the ordinary factorial function, the Gamma function satisfies the following translation formula: 

$$\Gamma(x+1) = x\Gamma(x)$$ 

away from $x = 0, -1, -2, \ldots$. 

It also satisfies a reflection formula, due to Euler: 

$$\Gamma(x)\Gamma(1-x) = \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi x)}.$$ 

Quite remarkably, the Gamma function (this time as a function of a real variable) is uniquely characterized in the following theorem:

###### Theorem (Bohr-Mollerup) 
The restriction of the Gamma function to the interval $(0, \infty)$ is the unique function $f$ such that $f(x+1) = x f(x)$, $f(1) = 1$, and $\log f$ is convex.

A number of other representations of the Gamma function are known and frequently utilized, e.g., 

* Product representation: 
$$\frac1{\Gamma(x)} = x e^{\gamma x} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 + \frac{x}{n})e^{-x/n}$$ 
where $\gamma$ is [[Euler's constant]]. 

* Integral representation: 
$$\Gamma(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t^x e^{-t} \frac{d t}{t}.$$
