## Idea

The _Adams spectral sequence_ ([Adams 58](#Adams58)) is a type of [[spectral sequences]] used for computations  in [[stable homotopy theory]]. It computes the [[homotopy groups]] of a certain [[nilpotent completion]] of a [[spectrum]] (sometimes, but not necessarily, a [[Bousfield localization of spectra|Bousfield localization of spectra]]) from its [[homology]]/[[cohomology]], as [[modules]]/[[comodules]] over its [[cohomology operations]]. The Adams spectral sequence can be seen as a variant of the [[Serre spectral sequence]] obtained by replacing a single fibration by an "[[Adams resolution]]". 

The original Adams spectral sequence for [[ordinary cohomology]] is further refined by the _[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]_ ([Novikov 67](#Novikov67)) by replacing [[ordinary cohomology]] modulo $p$ by [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] or [[Brown-Peterson theory]] or the like. Generally, for $E$ a suitable [[E-infinity algebra]] there is a corresponding $E$-Adams(-Novikov) spectral sequence whose second page is given by $E$-[[generalized cohomology]] and which arises as the [[spectral sequence of a simplicial stable homotopy type]] of the [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] object which is the [[Cech nerve]]/[[Sweedler coring]]/[[Amitsur complex]] of $E$. As such the Adams spectral sequence is an analog in [[stable homotopy theory]] of the [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence|Bousfield-Kan]] [[homotopy spectral sequence]].

Working with the Adams spectral sequence tends to be fairly involved, as is clear from the subtlety of the results it computes (notably [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]) and as witnessed by the fact that one uses further [[spectral sequences]] just to compute the low pages of the Adams spectral sequence, e.g. the [[May spectral sequence]] and the  [[chromatic spectral sequence]]. 

A clear conceptual picture in [[higher algebra]]  of what happens in the Adams spectral sequence ([Lurie 10](#Lurie10)) has emerged via the re-formulation in ([Miller 81](#Miller81), [Hopkins 99](#Hopkins99)). Survey of this perspective includes ([Wilson 13](#Wilson13)). 

Here one observes that for $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], hence an [[E-∞ ring]], the [[totalization]] of its [[Amitsur complex]] [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] spectrum is really the algebraic dual incarnation of the [[1-image]] factorization of the the terminal morphism

$$
  \array{
    Spec(E) &\longrightarrow& Spec(Tot(E^{\wedge^\bullet}))
    \\
    \downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Spec(\mathbb{S})
  }
$$

in [[E-∞ geometry]]/[[spectral geometry]].

Moreover, a [[spectrum]] $X$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] on $Spec(S)$ and $E^{\wedge^\bullet} \wedge X$ is accordingly the [[Sweedler coring]] that expresses the [[descent]] property of $X$ pullled back along the cover $p$, dually the $E$-[[localization]] of $X$. The Adams spectral sequence may then be seen to be the computation of the [[homotopy groups]] of the $E$-localization of $X$ in terms of its restriction to that cover. 

In general, notably for $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$, the [[1-image]] of $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is smaller than $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and therefore this process computes not all of $X$, but just the restriction to that one image (for instance just the $p$-local component). Examples of ring spectra which are "complete" with respect to the sphere spectrum in that the above 1-image coincides with $Spec(S)$ notably includes the [[complex cobordism cohomology]] spectrum $E = $[[MU]] ([Hopkins 99, p. 70](#Hopkins99)). 

That explains the relevance of the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]] (noticing that the wedge summands of $MU_{(p)}$ are the [[Brown-Peterson spectrum|BP-spectra]]) and the close interplay between the ANSS and [[chromatic homotopy theory]].  



### Via iterated Hurewicz theorem and Serre spectral sequence
 {#MotivationFromHurewiczTheoremAndSerreSpectralSequence}

The Adams spectral sequence may be motivated from the strategy to 
compute [[homotopy groups]] from [[cohomology groups]] by subsequently applying the [[Hurewicz theorem]] to compute the lowest-degree non-trivial homotopy group from the corresponding [[cohomology group]], then co-killing that by forming its [[homotopy fiber]], finally applying the [[Serre spectral sequence]] to  identify the next lowest non-trivial cohomology group of that fiber, and then iterating this process. The Adams spectral sequence arises when in this kind of strategy instead of co-killing only the lowest lying [[cohomology group]], one at a time, one co-kills _all_ nontrivial cohomology groups, then forms the corresponding [[homotopy fiber]] and so on.

This was apparently historically the way that [[John Adams]] indeed proceeded from [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]'s approach and this is still a good motivation for the whoe construction, a nice exposition is in  ([Wilson 13, 1.1](#Wilson13)).

We now say this again in more detail.

Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the probem of computing the [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_k(S^n) \;mod \;2$ of the $n$-[[sphere]] $S^n$. For $k \leq n$ this is clear: first for $k \lt n$ they all vanish, and second for $k = n$ we have, by the very nature of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]] $K(\mathbb{Z}_2, n)$, that the [[ordinary cohomology]] is

$$
  H^n(S^n, \mathbb{Z}_2) \simeq [S^n, K(\mathbb{Z}_2,n)] \simeq \pi_n(K(\mathbb{Z}_2,n)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
$$

so that by the [[Hurewicz theorem]] it follows that also

$$
  \pi_n(S^n) \;mod\;2 \;\simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
  \,.
$$

The [[Hurewicz theorem]] does not say anything beyond the first non-vanishing cohomology group, but so to apply it again we can move up one step in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $S^n$ and hence consider the [[homotopy fiber]]

$$
  \array{
     F_1
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     S^n &\stackrel{c_1}{\longrightarrow}& K(\mathbb{Z}_2,n)
  }
$$

of the generator $[c_1] = 1 \in \pi_n(S^n) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2$.

To apply the [[Hurewicz theorem]] to that fiber we need to know its lowest non-trivial [[cohomology group]] again, and this is computed via the [[Serre spectral sequence]] applied to this [[fiber sequence]]. 

From here on the process repeats, and one moves higher through the [[Whitehead tower]] of $S^n$


$$
  \array{
     \vdots
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     F_1 &\stackrel{c_2}{\longrightarrow}& K(\mathbb{Z}_2, n+1)
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     S^n &\stackrel{c_1}{\longrightarrow}& K(\mathbb{Z}_2,n)
  }
  \,.
$$

The Adams spectral sequence arises from this strategy by co-killing not just the first non-trivial [[cohomology group]] at each stage, but _all_ nontrivial cohomology groups at a given stage.

This is done in [[stable homotopy theory]], so let now $X$ be a [[spectrum]] (for instance the [[sphere spectrum]] $X = \mathbb{S}$ if we still with the computation of the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]). Write $H \mathbb{F}_2$ for the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}_2$, so that an element in [[cohomology]]

$$
  [c] \in H^n(X) 
$$

is represented by the [[homotopy class]] of a [[homomorphism]] of [[spectra]] of the form

$$
  c \;\colon\;  X \longrightarrow \Sigma^n H\mathbb{F}_2
$$

(a [[cocycle]]), where "$\Sigma$" denotes [[suspension]], as usual.

If $X$ is a [[spectrum]] of [[finite type]] then there is a [[finite]] $I$ of non-trivial cohomology classes like this, and a choice of [[cocycles]] $c_i$ for each of them gives a single map

$$
  f_0 
    \coloneqq 
   (c_i)_I \;\colon\; 
   X \longrightarrow K_0 \coloneqq \bigvee_{i \in I} \Sigma^{n_i}H \mathbb{F}_2
$$

into a [[generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]. As before, this map classifies its [[homotopy fiber]]

$$
  \array{
    F_1
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
     X &\stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow}& K_0
  }
$$

which may be thought of as encoding all information about $X$ beyond its [[cohomology groups]]. Iterating this process gives the corresponding analog of the [[Whitehead tower]], called the _[[Adams resolution]]_ of $X$:

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    F_2 &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& K_2
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    F_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& K_1
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
     X &\stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow}& K_0
  }
  \,.
$$

The _Adams spectral sequence_ is that induced by the [[exact couple]] obtained by applying $\pi_\bullet$ to this [[Adams resolution]].

We now say this more in detail.

The [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] for all the [[homotopy fibers]] in this diagram arrange into a diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow & \nwarrow
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(F_2) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(K_2)
    \\
    \downarrow & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_2}}
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(F_1) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_1)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(K_1)
    \\
    \downarrow & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_1}}
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(X) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_0)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(K_0)
  }
  \,,
$$

where the diagonal maps are the [[connecting homomorphisms]] and hence decrease degree in $\pi_\bullet$ by one.
The idea now is to compute the [[homotopy groups]] of $X$ from the decomposed information in this diagram as follows.

First, by construction the homotopy groups $\pi_\bullet(K_s)$ are known, therefore we can identify elements 

$$
  \sigma \in \pi_\bullet(X)
$$

if they come from elements 

$$
  \sigma_s \in \pi_\bullet(X_s)
$$

whose image 

$$
  \pi_\bullet(f_s)(\sigma_s) \in \pi_\bullet(K_s)
$$

we understand. So the task is to understand the image of $\pi_\bullet(f_s)$ in $\pi_\bullet(K_s)$, for each $s$.

By [[exact sequence|exactness]] an element $\kappa_s \in \pi_\bullet(K_s)$ is in this image if its image 

$$
  \rho_{s+1} \coloneqq \partial(\kappa_s) \in \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+1})
$$

vanishes. Now, by construction of the resolution, "evidence" for this is that $f_{s+1}(\partial(\kappa_s)) \in \pi_{\bullet-1}(K_{s+1})$ vanishes, which in turn by [[exact sequence|exactness]] means equivalently that $\partial(\kappa_s)$ is the image of an element  $\rho_{s+2} \in  \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+2}) \to \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+1})$. Now again "evidence" for $\rho_{s+2}$ to vanish is that its image $f_{s+2}(\rho(s+2))$ vanishes, which again means that it comes from an element $\rho_{s+3} \in  \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+3}) \to \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+2})$.

Proceeding by [[induction]] this way, we find that accumulated "evidence" in homotopy groups of $K_\bullet$ for an element $\kappa_s$ to represent an element in $\pi_\bullet(X)$ is that its differential $\partial \kappa_s$ factors through all the $\pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+k}) \to \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_s)$. This in turn means that it factors through the [[inverse limit]] $\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_s \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_s)$.
Such an element $\kappa_s$ with 

$$
  \partial \kappa_s \in \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_s \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_s) \to \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{s+1})
$$

is called a _permanent cycle_.

In good cases, the [[Adams resolution]] is indeed a [[resolution]] which means that  the [[inverse limit]] $\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_s X_s $ is in fact [[contractible]]. This means that all the "evidence" accumulated in a permanent cycle is indeed sufficient evidence to prove the existence of an element $\sigma_s \in \pi_\bullet(X_s)$ and hence of an element $\sigma \in \pi_\bullet(X)$.


A trivial way for this to be the case is that the original $\sigma_s$ is itself in the image under $\partial$ of some element, in which case $\kappa_s = 0$ already all by itself. These elements are called _eventual boundaries_. Therefore if the Adams resolution is indeed a resolution, then the quotient group

$$
  \frac{permanent\;cycles}{eventual\;boundaries}
$$

gives elements in $\pi_\bullet(S)$, and this quotient is what the Adams spectral sequence computes.

### Classical discussion
 {#ClassicalDiscussion}

> under construction

Given a [[connective spectrum]] $X$ such that $H^\bullet(X)$
has finite type, then for each [[prime number]] $p$ there exists a [[spectral sequence]] which converges to the [[homotopy groups]] of $X$ modulo $p$ -- $\pi_\ast(X) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$ -- and whose $E^2$-page is

$$
  E_2^{s,t} \simeq  Ext_A^{s,t}(H^\bullet(X), \mathbb{Z}/(p) )
$$

where $A$ is the [[Steenrod algebra]]. 

This is built via an [[Adams resolution]]

$$
  \array{
    X = X_0 &\stackrel{g_0}{\leftarrow}&  X_1 &\stackrel{g_1}{\leftarrow}& X_2 &\stackrel{g_2}{\leftarrow}& X_3 &\stackrel{}{\leftarrow}& \cdots
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_0}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_1}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_3}} &&
    \\
    K_0 && K_1 && K_2 && K_2
  }
$$

The [[long exact sequence]] induced by this give an [[exact couple]] and the Adams spectral sequence is the corresponding [[spectral sequence]].

This is due to ([Adams 58](#Adams58)). A review is around ([Ravenel 86, theorem, 2.1.1, def. 2.1.8](#Ravenel86)).



### Via injective resolutions
 {#ViaInjectiveResolutions}


A streamlined discussion of $E$-[[Adams resolutions]] in close analogy to [[injective resolutions]] in [[homological algebra]] was given in ([Miller 81](#Miller81)), advertized in ([Hopkins 99](#Hopkins99)) and worked out in more detail in ([Aramian](#Aramian)).



#### $E$-Injective spectra

The $E$-[[Adams resolutions]] in [[stable homotopy theory]] that we are about to consider behave [[analogy|analogous]] to [[injective resolutions]] in [[homological algebra]]. For a streamlined discussion of $E$-Adams resolutions it is convenient to make that analogy precise ([Miller 81](#Miller81)).

Notice that the standard concept of [[exact sequences]] and [[injective objects]] makes sense in [[abelian categories]], but not in the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]]; for instance the true homotopy theoretic analog of exact sequences are [[homotopy fiber sequences]]. But for computational purposes we may consider a variant (due to [Miller 81](#Miller81)), where a sequence of spectra $X_\bullet$ is regarded as exact if the [[homotopical functor]] to abelian groups that it represents sends objects to standard exact sequences.  




+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[spectrum]], we say that the _[[homotopical functor]]_
that it [[representable functor|co-represents]] is the functor of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[mapping spectrum]]-construction out of $X$, regarded as a functor on the [[stable homotopy category]]:

$$
  \pi_\bullet[X, -] \colon Ho(Spectra) \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

(Regarded as an [[(∞,1)-functor]] on the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] this is also called the _[[homological functor]]_ co-represented by $X$.)

###### Example

For $X = \mathbb{S}$ the [[sphere spectrum]] then the homotopical functor that it co-represents according to def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}

$$
  \pi_\bullet[\mathbb{S},- ]\simeq \pi_\bullet(-)
$$

is the [[stable homotopy group]]-functor.

###### Definition

Say that 

1. a sequence of [[spectra]]

   $$
     A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow A_n
   $$

   is 

   1. a (long) _exact sequence_ if the induced sequence of [[homotopy functors]] according to def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}, is a [[long exact sequence]] in $[HoSpectra,Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}]$;

   2. (for $n = 2$) a _short exact sequence_ if

      $$
        0 \longrightarrow A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow A_3 \longrightarrow 0
      $$

      is (long) exact in the above sense;


1. a morphism $A \longrightarrow B$  is 

   1. a _monomorphism_ if $0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B$ is an exact sequence in the above sense;

   1. an _epimorphism_ if $A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence in the above sense.

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then a sequence of spectra is called (long/short) _$E$-exact_ and a morphism is epi/mono, respectively, if becomes long/short exact or epi/mono, respectively, after taking [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] with $E$.

We need to check that for every $X$ the morphism $i^\ast \colon [B, X]\to [A,X]$ is surjective. By retraction, given $f \colon A \to X$, then $r \circ f \colon B \stackrel{r}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} X$ is a preimage.

###### Remark/Warning

Consecutive morphisms in an $E$-exact sequence according to def. \ref{ExactSequences} in general need not compose up to homotopy, to the [[zero morphism]]. But this does become true for sequences of $E$-injective objects, defined below in def. \ref{EInjective}.

###### Lemma

1. If $f \colon B\longrightarrow A$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a morphism $g \colon C \longrightarrow A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     f \vee g \;\colon\; B \wedge C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

   In particular, every morphism in [[Ho(Spectra)]] has an [[extension]] along a monomorphism in this sense. 

1. If $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ is an epimorpimsm in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a homotopy [[section]] $s \colon B\to A$, i.e. $f\circ s\simeq Id$, together with a morphism $g \colon C \to A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     s \vee f \colon B\vee C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a monomorphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$, consider the correspondiing [[homotopy cofiber sequence]]

$$
  A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C  \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A \stackrel{-\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma B
  \,.
$$

We first observe that the [[connecting homomorphism]] is equivalent to the [[zero morphism]] $\delta \simeq 0$. This follows because by example \ref{HomotopyCofiberSequencesAreExactSequencesOfSpectra} the sequence

$$
  [C,X] 
    \stackrel{\delta^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow} 
  [\Sigma A, X]
    \stackrel{(-\Sigma f)^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow}
  [\Sigma B, X]
$$

is an [[exact sequence]] (of homotopy groups) for every $X$, while by example \ref{SuspensionPreservesExactSequencesOfSpectra} the morphism on the right is epi, so that $\delta^\ast_\bullet = 0$.

Now since $B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{\delta \simeq 0}{\longrightarrow}$ is also a [[homotopy fiber sequence]], the [[pasting law]] identifies $B \simeq C \times A \simeq C \vee A$:

$$
  \array{
    B \simeq C \times A &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& 0

###### Definition

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], say that a spectrum $S$ is _$E$-injective_ if for each morphism $A \longrightarrow S$ and  each $E$-monomorphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow S$ in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, there is a [[diagram]] in [[HoSpectra]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow & S

+-- {: .num_lemma #EInjectiveSpectraAreRetractsOfFreeEModules}
###### Lemma

A spectrum is $E$-injective in the sense of def. \ref{EInjective}, precisely if it is a [[retract]] in [[HoSpectra]] of a free $E$-modules, hence of $E \wedge X$ for some spectrum $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, assume that $S$ is $E$-injective and consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{e \wedge id}}\downarrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
  \,.
$$

By example \ref{TensoringWithUnitOfRingSpectrumIsMonomorphismOfSpectra} here the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism, and so by assumption there is a lift

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
$$

which exhibits $S$ as a retract of $E \wedge S$.

In the other direction, given a retraction $S \stackrel{\overset{r}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{s}{\longrightarrow}} E \wedge X$ we show that there exist extensions in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} & S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
    \\
    B
  }
$$

whenever the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism. To see this, complete the extension problem to the following [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  && \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

Now, since $f$ is assumed to be an $E$-monomorphism, the morphism $Eid\wedge f$ on the right is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, and so by lemma \ref{CharacterizationOfEpiMonomorphismsOfSpectra} there exists an extension $h$ in 

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A

then the corresponding **$E$-Adams spectral sequence** for the [[mapping spectrum]] $[Y,X]$ is the associated [[spectral sequence of a tower of fibrations]] of the image of that [[tower of fibrations]] under the [[mapping spectrum]] operation $[Y,-]$:

###### Proposition

Given two $E$-Adams towers, def. \ref{EAdamsTower}, for some $X$, then the corresponding two $E$-Adams spectral sequences, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] from the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page on

=--

#### The $\mathcal{E}_1$-term and Hopf algebroid structure

Due to prop. \ref{UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence}, 
for understanding the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page of any $E$-Adams spectral sequence, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, 
it is sufficient to understand the $\mathcal{E}_1$-page 
of the $E$-Adams spectral sequence that is induced by the
standard $E$-resolution of example \ref{StandardEResolution}.

By construction, that page is 

$$
  \mathcal{E}_1^{s,\bullet}
    \simeq
  \pi_\bullet([Y,E^{\wedge (s+1)}\wedge X] )
$$

with the differentials being the image under $\pi_\bullet$ of the alternating sum of the morphisms that insert unit elements. 

We discuss now how, under favorable conditions, these homotopy groups of mapping spectra of the form $[Y,E^{\wedge (s+1)}\wedge X]$ may alternatively be computed as morphisms of $E$-[[generalized homology|homology]] equipped with suitable [[comodule]] structure over a [[Hopf algebroid]] structure on the dual $E$-[[Steenrod operations]] $E_\bullet(E)$. Then [below](#TheE2TermOfTheEAdamsSpectralSequence) we discuss that, as a result, the $d_1$-homology of the $\mathcal{E}_1$-page is seen to compute the [[Ext]]-groups from the $E$-homology of $Y$ to the $E$-homology of $X$, regarded as $E_\bullet(E)$-comodules.

The condition needed for this to work is the following

+-- {: .num_defn #FlatE}
###### Definition

Call the [[ring spectrum]] $E$ _flat_ if

$$
  \eta_L,\eta_R \colon E_\bullet \longrightarrow E_\bullet(E)

###### Example

Examples of ring spectra that are flat according to def. \ref{FlatE} include

* $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$ an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] with $mod\;p$ [[coefficients]];

* $E = B P$ the [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]];

* $E = MU$ the [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|complex cobordism spectrum]];

Examples of ring spectra that are _not_ flat in the sense of def. \ref{FlatE} include

* $E = H \mathbb{Z}$ the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for [[integers|integer]] [[coefficients]];

* $E = M S U$.

The key consequence of the assumption that $E$ is flat in the sense of def. \ref{FlatE} is the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #FlatnessOfEImpliesKeyConsequence}

    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge X)
$$

and hence for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there are isomorphisms

$$
  \pi_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{(n+2)}}\wedge X  )
    \simeq
  \underset{n+1\,factors}{

    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
    \cdots
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
  E_\bullet(E)
  }}
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
  E_\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$


=--

(e.g. [Schwede 12, prop. 6.20](#Schwede12))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The desired natural homomorphism

$$
  E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(X)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge X)
$$

is given on $[\alpha] \in \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E)$ and $[\beta] \in \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$ by $([\alpha, \beta])\mapsto [(id \wedge \mu \wedge id) \circ (\alpha \wedge \beta)]$.

To see that this is an isomorphism, observe that by flatness of $E$, the assignment $X \mapsto E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(-)$ is a [[generalized homology]] functor, hence [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by some spectrum. The above morphism, natural in $X$, thus constitutes a homomorphism  of generalized homology theories, and so for these to be equivalent it is sufficient to check that they induce isomorphisms on the point. This is manifestly the case.

Finally we get the claimed isomorphisms for all $n$ by [[induction]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{n+2}} \wedge X)
    & \simeq
    \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge E^{\wedge^n} \wedge X))

         \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}

We discuss the general definition of $E$-[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequences]] for suitable [[E-∞ rings]] $E$ expressed in [[higher algebra]], as in ([Lurie, Higher Algebra](#Lurie)). We follow [Lurie 10](#Lurie10), a nice exposition is in ([Wilson 13](#Wilson13)).

First we recall

* [Spectral sequences computing homotopy groups of filtered objects](#SpectralSequencesForHomotopyGroupsOfFilteredObjects)

for the general case of filtered objects in suitable [[stable (∞,1)-categories]]. Then we consider the specialization of that to the


* [Homotopy groups of cosimplicial totalizations filtered by coskeleta](#HomotopyGroupsOfOfTotalizationsFilteredByCoskeleta).

Finally we consider specifically the examples of such given by

* [Canonical cosimplicial resolutions of E-∞ algebras](#CanonicalCosimplicialResolutionOfEInfinityAlgebras).

In conclusion this yields for each suitable [[E-∞ algebra]] $E$ over $S$  and $S$-[[∞-module]] $X$ a [[spectral sequence]] converging to the [[homotopy groups]] of the $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of $X$, and this is

* [The E-Adams-Novikov spectral sequence](#TheEAdamsSpectralSequence).


The quick idea is this: Given an $S$ -module $X$, regard it as a quasicoherent sheaf on $Spec(S)$. Choose a map $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)$. This is a cover of its [[1-image]]
 $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)^\wedge_{Spec(E)}$, which is the derived [[formal completion]] of $Spec(S)$ at the image of $Spec(E)$. Restrict attention then to the restriction of $X$ to that formal completion $X^\wedge_{Spec(E)}$. (So if $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)$ was already an atlas, hence was already complete, we stick with the original $X$). Then pull back $S$ to the [[Cech nerve]] of the cover $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)^wedge_{Spec(E)}$. The realization of this Cech nerve reproduces the completed image, and hence the canonical filtration on the Cech nerve gives a filtration spectral sequence for $X^\wedge_{Spec(E)}$.


#### Spectral sequences computing homotopy groups of filtered objects
 {#SpectralSequencesForHomotopyGroupsOfFilteredObjects}

Let thoughout $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] equipped with a [[t-structure]] such that its [[heart of a stable (∞,1)-category|heart]] is an [[abelian category]]. 

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For instance 

* $\mathcal{C} = Spec$  the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralizedFilteredObject}
###### Definition

A _generalized [[filtered object]]_ in $\mathcal{C}$ is
simply a sequential diagram $X \colon (\mathbb{Z}, \lt) \to \mathcal{C}$

$$
  \cdots
  X_{n+1} \to X_n \to X_{n-1} \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

Or rather, the object being filtered is the [[homotopy limit]]

$$
  X \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n X_n
$$

and the sequential diagram exhibits the filtering.

=--

This appears as ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, def. 1.2.2.9]]).


+-- {: .num_defn #ExactCoupleForFilteredObject}
###### Definition

For a generalized filtered object $X_\bullet$, def. \ref{GeneralizedFilteredObject}, write 

$$
  F_n \coloneqq fib(X_n \to X_{n+1})
$$

for the [[homotopy fiber]] of the $n$th structure map, for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and define an [[exact couple]]

$$
  \array{
    && \pi_\bullet(F_\bullet)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
    && 
       \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
    && 
    \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
  }
$$

where the maps are given by the [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]]

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  \pi_\bullet(X_{n+1})
  \to 
  \pi_\bullet(F_n) \to  \pi_\bullet(X_n) \to \pi_\bullet(X_{n+1}) \to \pi_{\bullet+1}(F_n) \to \cdots
$$

=--

We now have the [[spectral sequence of a filtered stable homotopy type]].

+-- {: .num_prop #FiltrationSpectralSequence}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] equipped with a [[t-structure]] such that its [[heart of a stable (∞,1)-category|heart]] is an [[abelian category]]. 

If $\mathcal{C}$ has [[sequential limits]] and if  $X_n \simeq 0$ for all $n \gt n_0$ then the [[spectral sequence]] induced by the [[exact couple]]
of def. \ref{ExactCoupleForFilteredObject} converges to the [[homotopy groups]] of the [[homotopy limit]] $\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n X_n$ of the generalized filtered object:

$$
  E^{p,q}_1
  =
  \pi_{p+q} F_{p-1}
  \Rightarrow
  \pi_{p+q} (\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet) 
$$

=--

This is due to ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, prop. 1.2.2.14]]). Review is in ([Wilson 13, theorem 1.2.1](#Wilson13)).

+-- {: .num_defn #FiltrationOfTotalizationByTotalizationOfCoskeleta}
###### Definition

Given an [[cosimplicial object]] 

$$
  Y \;\colon\; \Delta  \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

its [[totalization]] $Tot Y \simeq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n Y_n$
is filtered, def. \ref{GeneralizedFilteredObject}, by the 
totalizations of its [[coskeleton|coskeleta]]

$$
  Tot Y 
  \to 
  \cdots 
  \to 
  Tot (cosk_2 Y) 
  \to
  Tot (cosk_1 Y) 
  \to
  Tot (cosk_0 Y) 
  \to 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #E2PageByMooreComplex}
###### Proposition

The filtration spectral sequence, prop. \ref{FiltrationSpectralSequence},
applied to the filtration of a [[totalization]] by [[coskeleton|coskeleta]] as in def. \ref{FiltrationOfTotalizationByTotalizationOfCoskeleta}, has as $E_2$-term the [[cohomology groups]] of the [[Moore complex]] associated with the cosimplicial object

$$
  E_2^{p,q}
  = 
  H^p(\pi_q(Tot (cosk_\bullet(Y))))
  \Rightarrow
  \pi_{p-q} Tot(Y)
  \,.
$$


=--

This is ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, remark 1.2.4.4]]). Review is around  ([Wilson 13, theorem 1.2.4](#Wilson13)).



#### Canonical cosimplicial resolution of $E_\infty$-algebras
 {#CanonicalCosimplicialResolutionOfEInfinityAlgebras}

We discuss now the special case of coskeletally filtered 
totalizations coming from the canonical cosimplicial objects
induced from [[E-∞ algebras]] ("[[Amitsur complexes]]", "[[Sweedler corings]]").

In this form this appears as ([Lurie 10, theorem 2](#Lurie10)). A review is in ([Wilson 13, 1.3](#Wilson13)). For the analog of this in the traditional formulation see ([Ravenel 86, ch. 3, prop. 3.1.2](#Ravenel86)).



+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $S$ be an [[E-∞ ring]] and let $E$ be an [[E-∞ algebra]] over $S$, hence an [[E-∞ ring]] equipped with a [[homomorphism]]

$$
  S \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

The _canonical [[cosimplicial object]]_ 
associated to this (the "$\infty$-[[Sweedler coring]]" or "[[Amitsur complex]]") is that given by the iterated [[smash product]]/[[tensor product]] over $S$:

$$
  E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}_S} \;\colon\; \Delta \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

More generally, for $X$ an $S$-[[∞-module]], the canonical [[cosimplicial object]] is

$$
  E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}_S}\wedge_S X \;\colon\; \Delta \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #FlatnessCondition}
###### Proposition

If $E$ is such that the self-[[generalized homology]] 
$E_\bullet(E) \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E \wedge_S E)$ (the dual $E$-[[Steenrod operations]]) is such that as a [[module]] over $E_\bullet \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E)$ it is a [[flat module]], then there is a [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  \pi_\bullet
  \left(
    E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}
    \wedge_S 
    X
  \right)
  \simeq
  E_\bullet(E^{\wedge^n_S})
  \otimes_{E_\bullet}
  E_\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This makes $(E_\bullet, E_\bullet(E))$ be the [[Hopf algebroid]]
formed by the  $E$-[[Steenrod algebra]]. See there for more on this.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The condition in prop. \ref{FlatnessCondition} is
satisfied for 

* $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$ an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] with $mod\;p$ [[coefficients]];

* $E = B P$ the [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]];

* $E = MU$ the [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|complex cobordism spectrum]].

It is NOT satisfied for

* $E = H \mathbb{Z}$ the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for [[integers|integer]] [[coefficients]];

* $E = M S U$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #ExtGroupsByMooreComplex}
###### Remark

Under good conditions (...), $\pi_\bullet$ of the canonical [[cosimplicial object]] provides a [[resolution]] of [[comodule]] [[tensor product]] and hence computes the [[Ext]]-groups over the [[Hopf algebroid]]:

$$
  H^p(\pi_q(Tot(cosk_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}_S } \wedge_S X))))
  \simeq
  Ext^p_{E_\bullet(E)}(\Sigma^q E_\bullet, E_\bullet(X))
  \,.
$$

(...)

=--

Here the homotopy groups are expressed by [[Ext]]-groups using a [[universal coefficient theorem]] 
[for generalized cohomology](universal+coefficient+theorem#ForGeneralizedCohomology)  ([Adams 74, III.13](#Adams74)).


(e.g. [Wilson 13, theorem 1.3.5](#Wilson13), based on [Bousfield 79](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#Bousfield79))



+-- {: .num_remark #CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization}
###### Remark

There is a canonical map

$$
  L_E X \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n (E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}\wedge_S X)
$$

from the $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra]] of $X$ into the [[totalization]].


=--

We consider now conditions for this morphism to be an [[equivalence]].

+-- {: .num_defn #CoreOfARing}
###### Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], its _core_ $c R$ is the [[equalizer]] in

$$
  c R 
    \longrightarrow 
  R 
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
  R \otimes R
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SufficientConditionsForTotalizationToBeELocalization}
###### Proposition

Let $E$ be a [[connective spectrum|connective]] [[E-∞ ring]] such that the core of $\pi_0(E)$, def. \ref{CoreOfARing}, is either of

* the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of the [[integers]] at a set $J$ of [[primes]], $c \pi_0(E) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$;

* $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for $n \geq 2$.

Then the map in remark \ref{CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization} is an equivalence

$$
  L_E X \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n (E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}\wedge_S X)
  \,.
$$

=--

([Bousfield 79](#Bousfield79)).

#### The $E$-Adams-Novikov spectral sequence
 {#TheEAdamsSpectralSequence}

Summing this up yields the general $E$-Adams(-Novikov) spectral sequence

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

Let $E$ a [[connective spectrum|connective]] [[E-∞ ring]] 
that satisfies the conditions of prop. \ref{SufficientConditionsForTotalizationToBeELocalization}. 
Then by prop. \ref{FiltrationSpectralSequence} and prop. \ref{SufficientConditionsForTotalizationToBeELocalization} there is a strongly convergent multiplicative
[[spectral sequence]]

$$
  E^{p,q}_\bullet \Rightarrow \pi_{q-p} L_{c \pi_0 E} X
$$

converging to the [[homotopy groups]] of the  $ c \pi_0(E)$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of $X$. If moreover the dual $E$-[[Steenrod algebra]] $E_\bullet(E)$ is [[flat module|flat]] as a [[module]] over $E_\bullet$, then, by prop. \ref{E2PageByMooreComplex} and remark \ref{ExtGroupsByMooreComplex}, the $E_2$-term of this spectral sequence is given by the [[Ext]]-groups over the $E$-[[Steenrod algebra|Steenrod]] [[Hopf algebroid]].

$$
  E^{p,q}_\bullet
  =
  Ext^p_{E_\bullet(E)}(\Sigma^q E_\bullet, E_\bullet X)
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Relation to Steenrod algebra

The $E_2$-page of the Adams spectral sequence for the $p$-component of 
$\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$  is the ordinary [[Steenrod algebra]] (for given prime $p$).

More generally, For $R$ an [[E-infinity ring]] such that its dual $R$-[[Steenrod algebra]] in the form of the self-[[homology]] $R_\bullet(R)$ is a [[Hopf algebroid]] over $R_\bullet = \pi_\bullet(R)$ (see at [Steenrod algebra -- Hopf algebroid structure](Steenrod+algebra#HopfAlgebraStructure)), then the $E^2$-term of the $E$-Adams spectral sequence is an [[Ext]] of $E_\bullet(E)$-[[comodules]]

$$
  E^2 \simeq Ext_{R_\bullet(R)}(R_\bullet, R_\bullet(X))
  \,.
$$
