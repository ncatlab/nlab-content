## Idea

The _Adams spectral sequence_ ([Adams 58](#Adams58)) is a type of [[spectral sequences]] used for computations  in [[stable homotopy theory]]. It computes the [[homotopy groups]] of a certain [[nilpotent completion]] of a [[spectrum]] (sometimes, but not necessarily, a [[Bousfield localization of spectra|Bousfield localization of spectra]]) from its [[homology]]/[[cohomology]], as [[modules]]/[[comodules]] over its [[cohomology operations]]. The Adams spectral sequence may be seen as a variant of the [[Serre spectral sequence]] obtained by replacing a single fibration by an "[[Adams resolution]]". 

The original _[[classical Adams spectral sequence]]_ for [[ordinary cohomology]] is further refined by the _[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]_ ([Novikov 67](#Novikov67)) by replacing [[ordinary cohomology]] modulo $p$ by [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] or [[Brown-Peterson theory]]. 

Generally, for $E$ a suitable [[E-infinity algebra]] there is a corresponding _$E$-Adams(-Novikov) spectral sequence_ whose second page is given by $E$-[[generalized cohomology]] and which arises as the [[spectral sequence of a simplicial stable homotopy type]] of the [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] object which is the [[Cech nerve]]/[[Sweedler coring]]/[[Amitsur complex]] of $E$. As such the Adams spectral sequence is an analog in [[stable homotopy theory]] of the [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence|Bousfield-Kan]] [[homotopy spectral sequence]] in unstable [[homotopy theory]].

Working with the Adams spectral sequence tends to be fairly involved, as is clear from the subtlety of the results it computes (notably [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]) and as witnessed by the fact that one uses further [[spectral sequences]] just to compute the low pages of the Adams spectral sequence, e.g. the [[May spectral sequence]] and the  [[chromatic spectral sequence]]. 

A clear conceptual picture in [[higher algebra]]  of what happens in the Adams spectral sequence ([Lurie 10](#Lurie10)) has emerged via the re-formulation in ([Miller 81](#Miller81), [Hopkins 99](#Hopkins99)). Survey of this perspective includes ([Wilson 13](#Wilson13)). 

Here one observes that for $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], hence an [[E-∞ ring]], the [[totalization]] of its [[Amitsur complex]] [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] spectrum is really the algebraic dual incarnation of the [[1-image]] factorization of the the terminal morphism

$$
  \array{
    Spec(E) &\longrightarrow& Spec(Tot(E^{\wedge^\bullet}))
    \\
    \downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Spec(\mathbb{S})
  }
$$

in [[E-∞ geometry]]/[[spectral geometry]].

Moreover, a [[spectrum]] $X$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] on $Spec(S)$ and $E^{\wedge^\bullet} \wedge X$ is accordingly the [[Sweedler coring]] that expresses the [[descent]] property of $X$ pullled back along the cover $p$, dually the $E$-[[localization]] of $X$. The Adams spectral sequence may then be seen to be the computation of the [[homotopy groups]] of the $E$-localization of $X$ in terms of its restriction to that cover. 

In general, notably for $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$, the [[1-image]] of $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is smaller than $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and therefore this process computes not all of $X$, but just the restriction to that one image (for instance just the $p$-local component). Examples of ring spectra which are "complete" with respect to the sphere spectrum in that the above 1-image coincides with $Spec(S)$ notably includes the [[complex cobordism cohomology]] spectrum $E = $[[MU]] ([Hopkins 99, p. 70](#Hopkins99)). 

That explains the relevance of the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]] (noticing that the wedge summands of $MU_{(p)}$ are the [[Brown-Peterson spectrum|BP-spectra]]) and the close interplay between the ANSS and [[chromatic homotopy theory]].

### The $E$-Adams spectral sequence
 {#ViaInjectiveResolutions}

We here discuss Adams spectral sequences for computation of $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of [[mapping spectra]] $[Y,X]$ for by $E$ a general [[commutative ring spectrum]] which is flat in a certain sense (def. \ref{FlatE} below).

The classical Adams spectral sequence is the special case with $Y = X = \mathbb{S}$ and $E = $ [[HA|A]]$\mathbb{F}_p$, discussed [below](#ClassicalCase).

The _[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]_ is the special case with $Y = X = \mathbb{S}$ and $E = $ [[MU]], discussed [below](#TheAdamsNovikovSpectralSequence).


#### $E$-Adams resolutions

A streamlined discussion of $E$-[[Adams resolutions]] in close analogy to [[injective resolutions]] in [[homological algebra]] was given in ([Miller 81](#Miller81)), advertized in ([Hopkins 99](#Hopkins99)) and worked out in more detail in ([Aramian](#Aramian)).


Notice that the standard concept of [[exact sequences]] and [[injective objects]] makes sense in [[abelian categories]], but not in the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]]; for instance the true homotopy theoretic analog of exact sequences are [[homotopy fiber sequences]]. But for computational purposes we may consider a variant (due to [Miller 81](#Miller81)), where a sequence of spectra $X_\bullet$ is regarded as exact if the [[homotopical functor]] to abelian groups that it represents sends objects to standard exact sequences.  




+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[spectrum]], we say that the _[[homotopical functor]]_
that it [[representable functor|co-represents]] is the functor of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[mapping spectrum]]-construction out of $X$, regarded as a functor on the [[stable homotopy category]]:

$$
  \pi_\bullet[X, -] \colon Ho(Spectra) \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

(Regarded as an [[(∞,1)-functor]] on the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] this is also called the _[[homological functor]]_ co-represented by $X$.)

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $X = \mathbb{S}$ the [[sphere spectrum]] then the homotopical functor that it co-represents according to def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}

$$
  \pi_\bullet[\mathbb{S},- ]\simeq \pi_\bullet(-)
$$

is the [[stable homotopy group]]-functor.

Throughout,$E$ is a [[ring spectrum]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ExactSequences}
###### Definition

Say that 

1. a sequence of [[spectra]]

   $$
     A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow A_n
   $$

   is 

   1. a (long) _exact sequence_ if the induced sequence of [[homotopy functors]] according to def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}, is a [[long exact sequence]] in $[HoSpectra,Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}]$;

   2. (for $n = 2$) a _short exact sequence_ if

      $$
        0 \longrightarrow A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow A_3 \longrightarrow 0
      $$

      is (long) exact in the above sense;


1. a morphism $A \longrightarrow B$  is 

   1. a _monomorphism_ if $0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B$ is an exact sequence in the above sense;

   1. an _epimorphism_ if $A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence in the above sense.

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then a sequence of spectra is called (long/short) _$E$-exact_ and a morphism is epi/mono, respectively, if becomes long/short exact or epi/mono, respectively, after taking [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] with $E$.

Every [[homotopy cofiber sequence]] of spectra is exact in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}.

###### Example

The [[suspension]] functor $\Sigma \colon Ho(Spectra) \to Ho(Spectra)$ preserves exact sequences in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[adjunction]]-[[isomorphism]] $[\Sigma A_\bullet, -]\simeq [A_\bullet, \Omega(-)]$ and so the statement follows from the assumption that $A_\bullet$ is long exact.

###### Example

If a morphism, $s \colon A \to B$ has a [[retraction]] $r \colon B \to A$ in [[Ho(Spectra)]] then it is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that for every $X$ the morphism $i^\ast \colon [B, X]\to [A,X]$ is surjective. By retraction, given $f \colon A \to X$, then $r \circ f \colon B \stackrel{r}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} X$ is a preimage.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #TensoringWithUnitOfRingSpectrumIsMonomorphismOfSpectra}
###### Example

For any spectrum $X$ the morphism

$$
  X \simeq \mathbb{S} \wedge X \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow}
  E \wedge X
$$

is an $E$-monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that $E \wedge X \stackrel{id \wedge e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} E \wedge E \wedge X$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}. Observe that this morphism has a [[retraction]] given by $\mu \wedge id$. Therefore it is a monomorphism by 
example  \ref{HomotopyRetractionsAreMonomorphismsOfSpectra}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark/Warning

Consecutive morphisms in an $E$-exact sequence according to def. \ref{ExactSequences} in general need not compose up to homotopy, to the [[zero morphism]]. But this does become true for sequences of $E$-injective objects, defined below in def. \ref{EInjective}.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #CharacterizationOfEpiMonomorphismsOfSpectra}
###### Lemma

1. If $f \colon B\longrightarrow A$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a morphism $g \colon C \longrightarrow A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     f \vee g \;\colon\; B \wedge C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

   In particular, every morphism in [[Ho(Spectra)]] has an [[extension]] along a monomorphism in this sense. 

1. If $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ is an epimorpimsm in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a homotopy [[section]] $s \colon B\to A$, i.e. $f\circ s\simeq Id$, together with a morphism $g \colon C \to A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     s \vee f \colon B\vee C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a monomorphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$, consider the correspondiing [[homotopy cofiber sequence]]

$$
  A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C  \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A \stackrel{-\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma B
  \,.
$$

We first observe that the [[connecting homomorphism]] is equivalent to the [[zero morphism]] $\delta \simeq 0$. This follows because by example \ref{HomotopyCofiberSequencesAreExactSequencesOfSpectra} the sequence

$$
  [C,X] 
    \stackrel{\delta^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow} 
  [\Sigma A, X]
    \stackrel{(-\Sigma f)^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow}
  [\Sigma B, X]
$$

is an [[exact sequence]] (of homotopy groups) for every $X$, while by example \ref{SuspensionPreservesExactSequencesOfSpectra} the morphism on the right is epi, so that $\delta^\ast_\bullet = 0$.

Now since $B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{\delta \simeq 0}{\longrightarrow}$ is also a [[homotopy fiber sequence]], the [[pasting law]] identifies $B \simeq C \times A \simeq C \vee A$:

$$
  \array{
    B \simeq C \times A &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& 0 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C &\longrightarrow& 0 &\longrightarrow& \Sigma A
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn #EInjective}
###### Definition

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], say that a spectrum $S$ is _$E$-injective_ if for each morphism $A \longrightarrow S$ and  each $E$-monomorphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow S$ in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, there is a [[diagram]] in [[HoSpectra]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow & S 
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists}}
    \\
    B
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #EInjectiveSpectraAreRetractsOfFreeEModules}
###### Lemma

A spectrum is $E$-injective in the sense of def. \ref{EInjective}, precisely if it is a [[retract]] in [[HoSpectra]] of a free $E$-modules, hence of $E \wedge X$ for some spectrum $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, assume that $S$ is $E$-injective and consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{e \wedge id}}\downarrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
  \,.
$$

By example \ref{TensoringWithUnitOfRingSpectrumIsMonomorphismOfSpectra} here the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism, and so by assumption there is a lift

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
$$

which exhibits $S$ as a retract of $E \wedge S$.

In the other direction, given a retraction $S \stackrel{\overset{r}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{s}{\longrightarrow}} E \wedge X$ we show that there exist extensions in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} & S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
    \\
    B
  }
$$

whenever the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism. To see this, complete the extension problem to the following [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  && \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

Now, since $f$ is assumed to be an $E$-monomorphism, the morphism $Eid\wedge f$ on the right is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, and so by lemma \ref{CharacterizationOfEpiMonomorphismsOfSpectra} there exists an extension $h$ in 

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  &\nwarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}& \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

By composition and commutativity, this gives the required extension of $g$ along $f$.

**(standard resolution)**

Any [[ring spectrum]] $E$ gives rise to an [[augmentation|augmented]] [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] [[spectrum]]  (its _[[bar construction]]_)

$$

    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
  E \wedge E \wedge E

whose

* coface maps are given by inserting the unit $\mathbb{S} \stackrel{e}{\to} E$

  $$

    E^{\wedge^n}
      \simeq
    E^{\wedge^i} \wedge \mathbb{S} \wedge E^{\wedge^{n-i}}
      \stackrel{id \wedge e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow}
    E^{\wedge^{n+1}}

The corresponding [[Amitsur complex]] is given by forming alternating sums of the coface maps

$$
  \mathbb{S}
    \stackrel{e}{\longrightarrow}
  E
    \stackrel{e\wedge id - id \wedge e}{\longrightarrow}
  E \wedge E
    \stackrel{e \wedge id - id\wedge e \wedge id + id \wedge e}{\longrightarrow}
  E \wedge E \wedge E
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

Given any [[spectrum]] $X$, then forming the [[smash product]] $(-)\wedge X$ with this sequence yields a sequence of the form

$$
  X
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E \wedge X
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E \wedge E \wedge X

As generally for [[bar resolutions]], one checks that the alternating sum of the codegeneracy maps constitute homotopy operators that give contracting homotopies when commuted with the alternating sum of the coface maps. This gives that the sequence is $E$-exact.

Given an $E$-Adams resolution

$$

    X_0 \coloneqq I_0

carefully by [[induction]]. This takes a bit of work, crucially using properties of $E$-injectives.

+-- {: .num_prop #UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence}
###### Proposition

Given two $E$-Adams towers, def. \ref{EAdamsTower}, for some $X$, then the corresponding two $E$-Adams spectral sequences, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] from the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page on

=--

#### The first page
 {#FirstPageAndHopfAlgebroid}

Due to prop. \ref{UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence}, 
for understanding the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page of any $E$-Adams spectral sequence, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, 
it is sufficient to understand the $\mathcal{E}_1$-page 
of the $E$-Adams spectral sequence that is induced by the
standard $E$-resolution of example \ref{StandardEResolution}.
By construction, that page is 

$$
  \mathcal{E}_1^{s,\bullet}
    \simeq
  \pi_\bullet(\;[Y,E^{\wedge (s+1)}\wedge X] \;)
$$

with the differentials being the image under $\pi_\bullet$ of the alternating sum of the morphisms that insert unit elements. 

We discuss now how, under favorable conditions, these homotopy groups of mapping spectra of the form $[Y,E^{\wedge (s+1)}\wedge X]$ may alternatively be computed as morphisms of $E$-[[generalized homology|homology]] equipped with suitable [[comodule]] structure over a [[Hopf algebroid]] structure on the dual $E$-[[Steenrod operations]] $E_\bullet(E)$. Then [below](#TheE2TermOfTheEAdamsSpectralSequence) we discuss that, as a result, the $d_1$-homology of the $\mathcal{E}_1$-page is seen to compute the [[Ext]]-groups from the $E$-homology of $Y$ to the $E$-homology of $X$, regarded as $E_\bullet(E)$-comodules. This re-formulation of the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page is the one that makes it be useful for computations.

The first condition needed for this to work is the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #FlatE}
###### Definition

Call the [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ _flat_ if one, equivalently both, of the morphisms

$$
  \eta_L \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(e \wedge id) 
  \;\colon\; 
  E_\bullet \longrightarrow E_\bullet(E)
$$

$$
  \eta_r 
  \;\coloneqq\; 
  \pi_\bullet(id \wedge e) \colon E_\bullet \longrightarrow E_\bullet(E)
$$

is a [[flat morphism]].

The key consequence of the assumption that $E$ is flat in the sense of def. \ref{FlatE} is the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #FlatnessOfEImpliesKeyConsequence}
###### Proposition

If $E$ is flat, def. \ref{FlatE}, then for all spectra $X$ there is a [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$
  E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge X)
$$

and hence for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there are isomorphisms

$$
  \pi_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{(n+2)}}\wedge X  )
    \simeq
  \underset{n+1\,factors}{
  \underbrace{E_\bullet(E)
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
    \cdots
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
  E_\bullet(E)
  }}
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
  E_\bullet(X)

=--

(e.g. [Adams 74, part III, lemma 12.5](#Adams74), [Schwede 12, prop. 6.20](#Schwede12))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The desired natural homomorphism

$$
  E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(X)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge X)
$$

is given on $[\alpha] \in \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E)$ and $[\beta] \in \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$ by $([\alpha, \beta])\mapsto [(id \wedge \mu \wedge id) \circ (\alpha \wedge \beta)]$.

To see that this is an isomorphism, observe that by flatness of $E$, the assignment $X \mapsto E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(-)$ is a [[generalized homology]] functor, hence [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by some spectrum. The above morphism, natural in $X$, thus constitutes a homomorphism  of generalized homology theories. By the [Whitehead theorem for generalized homology](generalized+Eilenberg-Steenrod+cohomology#WhiteheadTheorem) for this to be an isomorphism it is sufficient to check that it induces isomorphisms on the point. This is manifestly the case.

Finally we get the claimed isomorphisms for all $n$ by [[induction]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{n+2}} \wedge X)
    & \simeq
    \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge E^{\wedge^n} \wedge X))
    \\
    &\simeq 
     E_\bullet(E) 
         \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} 
     E_\bullet( E^{\wedge^n} \wedge X )
     \\
     & = 
     E_\bullet(E) 
         \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} 
     \pi_\bullet( E^{\wedge^{n+1}} \wedge X )

A **[[commutative Hopf algebroid]]** is an [[internal groupoid]] in the [[opposite category]] [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ of [[commutative rings]], regarded with its [[cartesian monoidal category]] structure.

(e.g. [Ravenel 86, def. A1.1.1](#Ravenel86))

+-- {: .num_remark #CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}
###### Remark

We unwind def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}.  For $R \in CRing$, write $Spec(R)$ for same same object, but regarded as an object in $CRing^{op}$. 

An [[internal category]] in $CRing^{op}$ is a [[diagram]] in $CRing^{op}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    Spec(\Gamma) \underset{Spec(A)}{\times} Spec(\Gamma)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\circ}}
    \\
    Spec(\Gamma)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s}}\downarrow \; \uparrow^{\mathrlap{i}} \downarrow^{\mathrlap{t}}
    \\
    Spec(A)
  }
  \,,
$$

(where the [[fiber product]] at the top is over $s$ on the left and $t$ on the right) such that the pairing $\circ$ defines an [[associativity law|associative]] [[composition]] over $Spec(A)$, [[unitality|unital]] with respect to $i$. This is an [[internal groupoid]] if it is furthemore equipped with a morphism

$$
  inv \;\colon\; Spec(\Gamma) \longrightarrow Spec(\Gamma)
$$

acting as assigning [[inverses]] with respect to $\circ$.

The key basic fact to use now is that [[tensor product]] of commutative rings exhibits the [[cartesian monoidal category]] structure on $CRing^{op}$, see at _[CRing -- Properties -- Cocartesian comonoidal structure](CRing#CocartesianComnonoidalStructure)_:

$$
  Spec(R_1) \underset{Spec(R_3)}{\times} Spec(R_2) 
  \simeq
  Spec(R_1 \otimes_{R_3} R_2)
  \,.
$$

This means that the above is equivalently a diagram in [[CRing]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma \underset{A}{\otimes} \Gamma
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi}}

###### Remark

Generally, in a commutative Hopf algebroid, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, the two morphisms $\eta_L, \eta_R\colon A \to \Gamma$ from remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut} need not coincide, they make $\Gamma$ genuinely into a [[bimodule]] over $A$, and it is the [[tensor product]] of [[bimodules]] that appears in remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}. But it may happen that they coincide:

An [[internal groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_1 \stackrel{\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{t}{\longrightarrow}}$ for which the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] morphisms coincide, $s = t$, is euqivalently a [[group object]] in the [[slice category]] over $\mathcal{G}_0$.

Dually, a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma \stackrel{\overset{\eta_L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\eta_R}{\longleftarrow}} A$ for which $\eta_L$ and $\eta_R$ happen to coincide is equivalently a commutative **[[Hopf algebra]]** $\Gamma$ over $A$.

###### Theorem

If $E$ is flat, def. \ref{FlatE}, and satisfies the conditions of prop. \ref{AdamsUCT}, and $E_\bullet(Y)$ a [[projective module]] over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, then the entries of the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page
of any $E$-Adams spectral sequence, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, for $[Y,X]$ are the [[Ext]]-groups of [[commutative Hopf algebroid]]-[[comodules]] for the [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] structure on $E$-operations $E_\bullet(E)$ from prop.  \ref{HopfAlgebroidStructureOnDualEOperations}:

By prop. \ref{UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence} it is sufficient to show this for the standard $E$-Adams resolution of prop. \ref{StandardAdamsResolutionIsIndeedAdamsResolution}. 
For that case the $\mathcal{E}_1$ page is given by prop. \ref{E1PageOfStandardEAdamsSpectralSequenceIsEBarComplex}, and so by the standard theory of [[derived functors in homological algebra]] (see the section _[Via acyclic resolutions](derived+functor+in+homological+algebra#ViaAcyclicResolutions)_), it is now sufficient to see that:

1. the category $E_\bullet(E) CoMod$ is an [[abelian category]];

1. the graded chain complex of prop. \ref{E1PageOfStandardEAdamsSpectralSequenceIsEBarComplex} is the image under the [[hom-functor]] $F \coloneqq Hom_{E_\bullet(E)}(E_\bullet(Y),-)$ of an $F$-[[acyclic resolution]] of $E_\bullet(X)$.

+-- {: .num_prop #CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat}
###### Proposition

If a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma$ over $A$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidDefinitionInExplicitComponents} is such that $\eta_L, \eta_R \colon A \longrightarrow \Gamma$ is a [[flat morphism]], then the [[category]] $\Gamma CoMod$ of [[comodules]] over $\Gamma$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidComodule}, is an [[abelian category]].

=--

(e.g. [Ravenel 86, theorem A1.1.3](#Ravenel86)) 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that, without any condition the Hopf algebroid, $\Gamma CoMod$ is an [[additive category]]. 

We need to show that with the assumption that $\Gamma$ is flat over $A$, then this is also a [[pre-abelian category]] in that [[kernels]] and [[cokernels]] exist. Let $f \colon (N_1,\Psi_{N_1}) \longrightarrow (N_2,\Psi_{N_2})$ be a morphism of comodules, hence a [[commuting diagram]] in $A$[[Mod]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    N_1 &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& N_2
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_1}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_2}}}
    \\
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_1
    &\stackrel{id_\Gamma \otimes_A f}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Consider the kernel $ker(f)$ of $f$ in $A$[[Mod]] and its image under $\Gamma \otimes_A (-)$

$$
  \array{
    ker(f) &\longrightarrow& N_1 &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& N_2
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_1}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_2}}}
    \\
    \Gamma \otimes_A ker(f) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_1
      &\stackrel{id_\Gamma \otimes_A f}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_2
  }
  \,.
$$

By the assumption that $\Gamma$ is a [[flat module]] over $A$, also $\Gamma \otimes_A ker(f) \simeq ker(\Gamma \otimes_A f)$ is a [[kernel]]. By its [[universal property]] this induces uniquely a morphism as shown on the left, making the above [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]. This means that the $A$-module $ker(f)$ uniquely inherits the structure of a $\Gamma$-comodule such as to make $ker(f) \to N_1$ a comodule homomorphism. By the same universal property it follows that $ker(f)$ with this comodule structure is in fact the kernel of $f$ in $\Gamma CoMod$.

The argument for the existence of [[cokernels]] proceeds [[formal dual|formally dually]]. Therefore it follows that the comparison morphism

$$
  coker(ker(f)) \longrightarrow ker(coker(f))
$$

formed in $\Gamma CoMod$ has underlying it the corresponding comparison morphism in $A Mod$. There this is an [[isomorphism]], hence it is an isomorphism also in $\Gamma CoMod$, and so the latter is not just a [[pre-abelian category]] but in fact an [[abelian category]] itself.

###### Proposition

If a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma$ over $A$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidDefinitionInExplicitComponents} is such that $\eta_L, \eta_R \colon A \longrightarrow \Gamma$ is a [[flat morphism]], then 

1. every co-free $\Gamma$-[[comodule]], def. \ref{CoFreeComodules}, on an [[injective module]] over $A$ is an [[injective object]] in $\Gamma CoMod$;

1. $\Gamma CoMod$ has [[enough injectives]] (if the [[axiom of choice]] holds in the ambient [[set theory]]).

=--

(e.g. [Ravenel 86, lemma A1.2.2](#Ravenel86))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, assuming the [[axiom of choice]], then the [[category of modules]] $A Mod$ has [[enough injectives]] (see [this proposition](injective+object#AbHasEnoughInjectives)).
Now by prop. \ref{CoFreeComodules} we have the [[adjunction]]

$$
  \Gamma CoMod
   \underoverset
     {\underset{forget}{\longrightarrow}}
     {\overset{co-free}{\longleftarrow}}
     {\bot}
  A Mod
 \,.
$$

Observe that the [[left adjoint]] is a [[faithful functor]] (being a [[forgetful functor]]) and that, by the proof of prop. \ref{CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat}, it is an [[exact functor]]. With this a standard lemma applies ([here](injective+object#TransferOfEnoughInjectivesAlongAdjunctions)) which says that

1. with $I \in A Mod$ an [[injective module]], then the co-free comodule $\Gamma \otimes_A I$ is an [[injective object]] in $\Gamma CoMod$;

1. for $N \in \Gamma CoMod$ any object, and for $i \colon U(N) \hookrightarrow I$ a monomorphism of $A$-modules into an injective $A$-module, then the [[adjunct]] $\tilde i \colon N \hookrightarrow \Gamma\otimes_A I$ is a monomorphism in $\Gamma CoMod$ (and into an injective comodule).

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #CoFreeHopfComodulesAreHomNAcyclicForProjectiveN}
###### Lemma

Let $\Gamma$ be a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] over $A$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidDefinitionInExplicitComponents}, such that $\eta_L, \eta_R \colon A \longrightarrow \Gamma$ is a [[flat morphism]], 
Let $N \in \Gamma CoMod$ be a Hopf [[comodule]], def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidComodule}, such that the underlying $A$-module is a [[projective module]] (a [[projective object]] in $A$[[Mod]]). 

Then  (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]) every co-free comodule, prop. \ref{CoFreeComodules}, is an $F$-[[acyclic object]] for $F$ the [[hom functor]] $Hom_{\Gamma CoMod}(N,-)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that the [[derived functors in homological algebra|derived functors]] $R^{\bullet} Hom_{\Gamma}(N,-)$ vanish in positive degree on all co-free comodules, hence on $\Gamma \otimes_A K$, for $K \in A Mod$. 

To that end, let $I^\bullet$ be an [[injective resolution]] of $K$ in $A Mod$. By prop. \ref{CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat} then $\Gamma \otimes_A I^\bullet$ is a sequence of [[injective objects]] in $\Gamma CoMod$ and by the assumption that $\Gamma$ is flat over $A$ it is an [[injective resolution]] of $\Gamma \otimes_A K$ in $\Gamma CoMod$. Therefore the derived functor in question is given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R^{\bullet \geq 1} Hom_\Gamma(N, \Gamma \otimes_A K)
    & \simeq
    H_{\bullet \geq 1}( Hom_\Gamma( N, \Gamma \otimes_A I^\bullet ) )
    \\
    & \simeq H_{\bullet \geq 1}( Hom_A(N, I^\bullet) )
    \\
    & \simeq 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the second equivalence is the cofree/forgetful adjunction isomorphism of prop. \ref{CoFreeComodules}, while the last equality then follows from the assumption that the $A$-module underlying $N$ is a [[projective module]] (since [[hom functors]] out of [[projective objects]] are [[exact functors]] ([here](projective+object#EquivalenceOfDefinitionsInAbelian)) and since derived functors of exact functors vanish in positive degree ([here](derived+functor+in+homological+algebra#DerivedFunctorOfExactFunctor))).

With lemma \ref{CoFreeHopfComodulesAreHomNAcyclicForProjectiveN} the proof of theorem \ref{SecondPageOfEAdamsSpectralSequence} is completed.

### As derived descent in higher algebra
 {#DefinitionInHigherAlgebra}

We discuss the general definition of $E$-[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequences]] for suitable [[E-∞ rings]] $E$ expressed in [[higher algebra]], as in ([Lurie, Higher Algebra](#Lurie)). We follow [Lurie 10](#Lurie10), a nice exposition is in ([Wilson 13](#Wilson13)).

First we recall

* [Spectral sequences computing homotopy groups of filtered objects](#SpectralSequencesForHomotopyGroupsOfFilteredObjects)

for the general case of filtered objects in suitable [[stable (∞,1)-categories]]. Then we consider the specialization of that to the


* [Homotopy groups of cosimplicial totalizations filtered by coskeleta](#HomotopyGroupsOfOfTotalizationsFilteredByCoskeleta).

Finally we consider specifically the examples of such given by

* [Canonical cosimplicial resolutions of E-∞ algebras](#CanonicalCosimplicialResolutionOfEInfinityAlgebras).

In conclusion this yields for each suitable [[E-∞ algebra]] $E$ over $S$  and $S$-[[∞-module]] $X$ a [[spectral sequence]] converging to the [[homotopy groups]] of the $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of $X$, and this is

* [The E-Adams-Novikov spectral sequence](#TheEAdamsSpectralSequence).


The quick idea is this: Given an $S$ -module $X$, regard it as a quasicoherent sheaf on $Spec(S)$. Choose a map $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)$. This is a cover of its [[1-image]]
 $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)^\wedge_{Spec(E)}$, which is the derived [[formal completion]] of $Spec(S)$ at the image of $Spec(E)$. Restrict attention then to the restriction of $X$ to that formal completion $X^\wedge_{Spec(E)}$. (So if $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)$ was already an atlas, hence was already complete, we stick with the original $X$). Then pull back $S$ to the [[Cech nerve]] of the cover $Spec(E) \to Spec(S)^wedge_{Spec(E)}$. The realization of this Cech nerve reproduces the completed image, and hence the canonical filtration on the Cech nerve gives a filtration spectral sequence for $X^\wedge_{Spec(E)}$.

  Y \;\colon\; \Delta  \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}

its [[totalization]] $Tot Y \simeq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n Y_n$

###### Proposition

The filtration spectral sequence, prop. \ref{FiltrationSpectralSequence},
applied to the filtration of a [[totalization]] by [[coskeleton|coskeleta]] as in def. \ref{FiltrationOfTotalizationByTotalizationOfCoskeleta}, has as $E_2$-term the [[cohomology groups]] of the [[Moore complex]] associated with the cosimplicial object

$$
  E_2^{p,q}
  = 
  H^p(\pi_q(Tot (cosk_\bullet(Y))))
  \Rightarrow
  \pi_{p-q} Tot(Y)
  \,.

This is ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, remark 1.2.4.4]]). Review is around  ([Wilson 13, theorem 1.2.4](#Wilson13)).



#### Canonical cosimplicial resolution of $E_\infty$-algebras
 {#CanonicalCosimplicialResolutionOfEInfinityAlgebras}

We discuss now the special case of coskeletally filtered 
totalizations coming from the canonical cosimplicial objects
induced from [[E-∞ algebras]] ("[[Amitsur complexes]]", "[[Sweedler corings]]").

In this form this appears as ([Lurie 10, theorem 2](#Lurie10)). A review is in ([Wilson 13, 1.3](#Wilson13)). For the analog of this in the traditional formulation see ([Ravenel 86, ch. 3, prop. 3.1.2](#Ravenel86)).



+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $S$ be an [[E-∞ ring]] and let $E$ be an [[E-∞ algebra]] over $S$, hence an [[E-∞ ring]] equipped with a [[homomorphism]]

$$
  S \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

The _canonical [[cosimplicial object]]_ 
associated to this (the "$\infty$-[[Sweedler coring]]" or "[[Amitsur complex]]") is that given by the iterated [[smash product]]/[[tensor product]] over $S$:

$$
  E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}_S} \;\colon\; \Delta \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

More generally, for $X$ an $S$-[[∞-module]], the canonical [[cosimplicial object]] is

$$
  E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}_S}\wedge_S X \;\colon\; \Delta \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #FlatnessCondition}
###### Proposition

If $E$ is such that the self-[[generalized homology]] 
$E_\bullet(E) \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E \wedge_S E)$ (the dual $E$-[[Steenrod operations]]) is such that as a [[module]] over $E_\bullet \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E)$ it is a [[flat module]], then there is a [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  \pi_\bullet
  \left(
    E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}
    \wedge_S 
    X
  \right)
  \simeq
  E_\bullet(E^{\wedge^n_S})
  \otimes_{E_\bullet}
  E_\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This makes $(E_\bullet, E_\bullet(E))$ be the [[Hopf algebroid]]
formed by the  $E$-[[Steenrod algebra]]. See there for more on this.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The condition in prop. \ref{FlatnessCondition} is
satisfied for 

* $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$ an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] with $mod\;p$ [[coefficients]];

* $E = B P$ the [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]];

* $E = MU$ the [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|complex cobordism spectrum]].

It is NOT satisfied for

* $E = H \mathbb{Z}$ the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for [[integers|integer]] [[coefficients]];

* $E = M S U$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #ExtGroupsByMooreComplex}
###### Remark

Under good conditions (...), $\pi_\bullet$ of the canonical [[cosimplicial object]] provides a [[resolution]] of [[comodule]] [[tensor product]] and hence computes the [[Ext]]-groups over the [[Hopf algebroid]]:

$$
  H^p(\pi_q(Tot(cosk_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}_S } \wedge_S X))))
  \simeq
  Ext^p_{E_\bullet(E)}(\Sigma^q E_\bullet, E_\bullet(X))
  \,.
$$

(...)

=--

Here the homotopy groups are expressed by [[Ext]]-groups using a [[universal coefficient theorem]] 
[for generalized cohomology](universal+coefficient+theorem#ForGeneralizedCohomology)  ([Adams 74, III.13](#Adams74)).


(e.g. [Wilson 13, theorem 1.3.5](#Wilson13), based on [Bousfield 79](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#Bousfield79))



+-- {: .num_remark #CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization}
###### Remark

There is a canonical map

$$
  L_E X \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n (E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}\wedge_S X)
$$

from the $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra]] of $X$ into the [[totalization]].


=--

We consider now conditions for this morphism to be an [[equivalence]].

+-- {: .num_defn #CoreOfARing}
###### Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], its _core_ $c R$ is the [[equalizer]] in

$$
  c R 
    \longrightarrow 
  R 
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
  R \otimes R
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SufficientConditionsForTotalizationToBeELocalization}
###### Proposition

Let $E$ be a [[connective spectrum|connective]] [[E-∞ ring]] such that the core of $\pi_0(E)$, def. \ref{CoreOfARing}, is either of

* the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of the [[integers]] at a set $J$ of [[primes]], $c \pi_0(E) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$;

* $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for $n \geq 2$.

Then the map in remark \ref{CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization} is an equivalence

$$
  L_E X \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n (E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}\wedge_S X)
  \,.
$$

#### The $E$-Adams-Novikov spectral sequence
 {#TheEAdamsSpectralSequence}

Summing this up yields the general $E$-Adams(-Novikov) spectral sequence

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

Let $E$ a [[connective spectrum|connective]] [[E-∞ ring]] 
that satisfies the conditions of prop. \ref{SufficientConditionsForTotalizationToBeELocalization}. 
Then by prop. \ref{FiltrationSpectralSequence} and prop. \ref{SufficientConditionsForTotalizationToBeELocalization} there is a strongly convergent multiplicative
[[spectral sequence]]

$$
  E^{p,q}_\bullet \Rightarrow \pi_{q-p} L_{c \pi_0 E} X
$$

converging to the [[homotopy groups]] of the  $ c \pi_0(E)$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of $X$. If moreover the dual $E$-[[Steenrod algebra]] $E_\bullet(E)$ is [[flat module|flat]] as a [[module]] over $E_\bullet$, then, by prop. \ref{E2PageByMooreComplex} and remark \ref{ExtGroupsByMooreComplex}, the $E_2$-term of this spectral sequence is given by the [[Ext]]-groups over the $E$-[[Steenrod algebra|Steenrod]] [[Hopf algebroid]].

$$
  E^{p,q}_\bullet
  =
  Ext^p_{E_\bullet(E)}(\Sigma^q E_\bullet, E_\bullet X)
  \,.
