See Adams summary (early in part III).

We consider the stable group $\lim_{\to} [ S^{n+r}X, S^n Y  ]$ for some finite complexes $X$ and $Y$.

The reduced cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z} / p$ is a module over the Steenrod algebra $A$.

The Adams spectral sequence goes from 

$$ E^{**}_A (\tilde{H}^*(Y; \mathbb{Z} / p), \tilde{H}^*(X; \mathbb{Z} / p) )
$$

to the above stable group. (What does this mean???)

There is actually a much better and more general formulation of all this. See Chapter 15 in Adams Part III.
