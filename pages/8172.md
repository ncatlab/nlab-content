## Idea

The _Adams spectral sequence_ is a type of [[spectral sequences]] used for computations  in [[stable homotopy theory]]. It computes the [[homotopy groups]] of a [[spectrum]] from its [[homology]]/[[cohomology]], as [[modules]]/[[comodules]] over its [[cohomology operations]].

It is a variant of the [[Serre spectral sequence]] obtained by restricting attention to the stable range of [[cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.

The Adams spectral sequence is further refined by the _[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]_ by replacing [[ordinary cohomology]] modulo $p$ by [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]].

## Definition

### Traditional

Given a [[connective spectrum]] $X$ such that $H^\bullet(X)$
has finite type, then for each [[prime number]] $p$ there exists a [[spectral sequence]] which converges to the [[homotopy groups]] of $X$ modulo $p$ $\pi_ast(X) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$ and whose $E^2$-page is

$$
  E_2^{s,t} \simeq  Ext_A^{s,t}(H^\bullet(X), \mathbb{Z}/(p) )
$$

where $A$ is the [[Steenrod algebra]]. 

This is built via an [[Adams resolution]]

$$
  \array{
    X = X_0 &\stackrel{g_0}{\leftarrow}&  X_1 &\stackrel{g_1}{\leftarrow}& X_2 &\stackrel{g_2}{\leftarrow}& X_3 &\stackrel{}{\leftarrow}& \cdots
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_0}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_1}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_3}} &&
    \\
    K_0 && K_1 && K_2 && K_2
  }
$$

The [[long exact sequence]] induced by this give an [[exact couple]] and the Adams spectral sequence is the corresponding [[spectral sequence]].

This is due to ([Adams 58](#Adams58)). A review is around ([Ravenel, theorem, 2.1.1, def. 2.1.8](#Ravenel)).

### Via cosimplicial spectra 

Let $p$ be a [[prime number]]. Write

$$
  R \coloneqq H \mathbb{F}_p
$$

for the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] of the [[field]] $\mathbb{F}_p$. The [[A-∞ algebra]] structure on this induces an [[augmentation|augmented]] [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] [[spectrum]]

$$
  \overline{R}^\bullet \;\colon\; k \mapsto R^{\otimes k}
  \,.
$$

Write $R^\bullet$ for the underlying [[cosimplicial object]] (here and in the following the overline indicates [[augmentation]]).

For $X$ any other [[spectrum]], [[tensor product|tensoring]] induces the (augmented) cosimplicial spectrum

$$
  \overline{X}^\bullet \coloneqq X \otimes \overline{R}^\bullet
  \,.
$$

Now the [[augmentation]] morphism induces a canonical map from $\overline{X}^{-1}$ into the [[totalization]] of $X^\bullet$

$$
  \overline{X}^{-1} \longrightarrow Tot X^\bullet
  \,.
$$

The Adams spectral sequence computes the [[kernels]] of the morphisms on [[homotopy groups]] of this map. 

In this form this appears as ([Lurie 10, theorem 2](#Lurie10)). For the traditional formulation see ([Ravenel, ch. 3, prop. 3.1.2](#Ravenel)).

## Properties

### Relation to Steenrod algebra

The $E_2$-page of the Adams spectral sequence for the $p$-component of 
$\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$  is the [[Steenrod algebra]] (for given prime $p$).
