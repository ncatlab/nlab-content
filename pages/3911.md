## Idea

_Fiber integration_ or _push-forward_ is a process that sends [[generalized cohomology]] classes on a [[bundle]] $E \to B$ of [[manifolds]] to cohomology classes on the base $B$ of the bundle, by _evaluating them on each fiber_ in some sense. 

This sense is such that if the cohomology in question is [[de Rham cohomology]] then fiber integration is ordinary [[integration]] of [[differential form]]s over the fibers. Generally, the fiber integration over a bundle of $k$-dimensional fibers reduces the degree of the cohomology class by $k$.

Composing pullback of cohomology classes with fiber integration yields the notion of [[transgression]].

## Definition

### In generalized cohomology by Umkehr maps

#### Along maps of manifolds

Here is the rough outline of the construction:

Let $p : E \to B$ be a [[bundle]] of smooth compact [[manifolds]] with typical [[fiber]] $F$. 

By the [[Whitney embedding theorem]] one can choose an embedding $e:E \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. From this one obtains an embedding

$$
  (p,e) : E \hookrightarrow B \times \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

Let $N_{(p,e)} (E)$ be the [[normal bundle]] of $E$ relative to this embedding. It is a rank $n- dim F$ bundle over the image of $E$ in $B \times \mathbb{R}^n$.

Fix a [[tubular neighbourhood]] of $E$ in $B \times \mathbb{R}^n$ and identify it with the total space of $N_{(p,e)}$. Then collapsing the whole $B \times \mathbb{R}^n - N_{(p,e)}(E)$ to a point gives the [[Thom space]] of $N_{(p,e)}(E)$, and the quotient map

$$
  B \times \mathbb{R}^n 
  \to 
  B \times \mathbb{R}^n / (B \times \mathbb{R}^n - N_{(p,e)}(E))
  \simeq
  Th(N_{(p,e)}(E))
$$

factors through the [[one-point compactification]] $(B \times \mathbb{R}^n)^*$
of $B \times \mathbb{R}^n$. Since $(B \times \mathbb{R}^n)^*\cong \Sigma^n B_+$,
the $n$-fold [[suspension]] of $B_+$ (or, equivalently, the [[smash product]] of $B$ with the $n$-sphere: $\Sigma^n B_+= S^n \wedge B_+$), we obtain a factorization
$$
  B \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \Sigma^n B_+ \stackrel{\tau}{\to} Th(N_{(p,e)}(E))
  \,,
$$
where $\tau$ is called the [[Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map]].

Explicitly, as sets we have $\Sigma^n B_+ \simeq B \times \mathbb{R}^n \cup \{\infty\}$ and $Th(N_{(e,p)}(E)) = N_{(e,p)} \cup \{\infty\}$, and for $U \subset \Sigma^n B_+$ a tubular neighbourhood of $E$ and $\phi : U \to N_{(e,p)}(E)$ an isomorphism, the map 

$$
  \tau : \Sigma^n B_+ \stackrel{}{\to} Th(N_{(p,e)}(E))
$$

is defined by

$$
  \tau : x \mapsto 
  \left\{
    \array{
      \phi(x) & | x \in U
      \\
      \infty & | otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Now let $H$ be some [[multiplicative cohomology theory]], and assume that the Thom space $Th(N_{(p,e)}(E))$ has an $H$-[[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]], so that we have a  [[Thom isomorphism]]. Then combined with the [[suspension isomorphism]] the pullback along $\tau$ produces a morphism

$$
  \int_F : H^\bullet(E) \to H^{\bullet - dim F}(B)
$$

of cohomologies

$$
  \array{
   H^\bullet(E)
   \\
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq_{Thom}}{\to}}
   \\
   H^{\bullet + n - dim F}(D(N_{(p,e)}(E)),S(N_{(p,e)}(E)))
   \\
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
   \\
   \tilde H^{\bullet + n - dim F}(Th(N_{(p,e)}(E)))
   &
   \stackrel{\tau^*}{\to}
   &
   \tilde H^{\bullet + n - dim F}(\Sigma^n B_+)
   \\
   && \downarrow{\mathrlap{\simeq_{suspension}}}   
   \\
   &&
   H^{\bullet - dim F}(B)
   }
   \,.
$$


This operation is independent of the choices involved. It is the **fiber integration** of $H$-cohomology along $p : E \to B$.

#### Along representable morphisms of stacks

The above definition generalizes to one of push-forward
in generalized cohomology on [[stacks]] over [[SmthMfd]]
along [[representable morphisms of stacks]].

### In KK-theory
 {#InKKTheory}

We discuss fiber integration/push-forward/[[Gysin maps]] in 
[[operator K-theory]], hence in [[KK-theory]] ([Connes-Skandalis 85](#ConnesSkandalis84), [BMRS 07, section 3](#BMRS07)).

The following discusses KK-pushforward

1. _[Along an embedding](#KKPushForwardAlongEmbedding)_

1. _[Along a submersion](#KKPushforwardAlongSubmersion)_

1. _[Along a general map](#KKPushforwardAlongGeneralMap)_

The construction goes back to ([Connes 82](#Connes82)), where it is given over smooth manifolds. Then ([Connes-Skandalis 84](#ConnesSkandalis84), [Hilsum-Skandalis 87](#HilsumSkandalis87)) generalize this to maps between [[foliations]] by KK-elements betwen the [[groupoid convolution algebras]] of the coresponding [[holonomy groupoids]] and  ([Rouse-Wang 10](#RouseWang10)) further generalize to the case where a [[circle 2-bundle]] twist is present over these foliations. A purely algebraic generalization to (K-oriented) maps between otherwise arbitrary [[noncommutative topology|noncommutative spaces]]/[[C*-algebras]] is in ([BMRS 07](#BMRS07)).

#### Along an embedding
 {#KKPushForwardAlongEmbedding}

Let $h \colon X \hookrightarrow Y$ be an [[embedding]] of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifolds]]. 

The push-forward constructed from this is supposed to be an element in [[KK-theory]]

$$
  h! \colon KK_d(C(X), C(Y))
$$

in terms of which the push-forward on [[operator K-theory]] is induced by postcomposition: 

$$
  h_! 
    \;\colon\;
  K^\bullet(X) 
   \simeq 
  KK_\bullet(\mathbb{C}, X)
  \stackrel{h!\circ (-)}{\to}
  KK_{\bullet+d}(\mathbb{C},Y)
  \simeq
 KK^{\bullet+d}(Y)
 \,,
$$

where $d = dim(X) - dim(Y)$. 


Now, if we could "thicken" $X$ a bit, namely to a [[tubular neighbourhood]] 

$$
  h  \;\colon\; X \hookrightarrow U \stackrel{j}{\hookrightarrow} Y
$$ 

of $h(X)$ in $Y$ without changing the K-theory of $X$, then the element in question will just be the KK-element

$$
  j! \in KK(C_0(U), C(Y))
$$

induced directly from the [[C*-algebra]] homomorphism $C_0(U) \to C(Y)$ from the [[algebra of functions]] [[vanishing at infinity]] of $U$ to functions on $Y$, given by extending these functions by 0 to functions on $Y$.
Or rather, it will be that element composed with the assumed KK-equivalence

$$
  \psi \colon C(X) \stackrel{\simeq_{KK}}{\to} C_0(U)
  \,.
$$

The bulk of the technical work in constructing the push-forward is in constructing this equivalence. ([BMRS 07, example 3.3](#BMRS07))

In order for it to exist at all, assume that the [[normal bundle]]

$$
  N_Y X \coloneqq h^\ast(T Y)/ T X
$$

has a [[spin^c structure]]. Write $S(N_Y X)$ for the associated [[spinor bundle]]. 

Then there is an invertible element in [[KK-theory]]

$$
  \iota^X! \in KK_n(C(X), C_0(N_Y X))
$$

hence a KK-equivalence $\iota^X! \colon C(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} C_0(N_Y X)$, where $C_0(-)$ denotes the [[algebra of functions]] [[vanishing at infinity]].

This is defined as follows. Consider the pullback $\pi_n^\ast S(N_Y X) \to N_Y X$ of this spinor to the normal bundle itself along the projection $\pi_N \colon N_Y X \to X$.  Then...

Moreover, a choice of a [[Riemannian metric]] on $X$ allows to find a [[diffeomorphism]] between the [[tubular neighbourhood]] $U_{h(X)}$ of $h(X)$ and a neighbourhood of the zero-section of of the normal bundle

$$
  \Phi \colon U_{h(X)} \hookrightarrow N_Y X
  \,.
$$

This induces a KK-equivalence

$$
  [\Phi] \colon C_0(N_Y X) \stackrel{\simeq_{KK}}{\to} C_0(U)
  \,.
$$

Therefore the push-forward in operator K-theory along $f \colon X \hookrightarrow Y$ is given by postcomposing in [[KK-theory]] with

$$
  h! \colon
  C(X)
    \underoverset{\simeq_{KK}}{i^X!}{\to}
  C_0(N_Y X)
    \underoverset{\simeq_{KK}}{\Phi}{\to}
  C_0(U)
    \stackrel{j!}{\to}
  C(Y)
  \,.
$$

#### Along a proper submersion
 {#KKPushforwardAlongSubmersion}

For $\pi \colon X \to Z$ a [[K-orientation|K-oriented]] [[proper map|proper]] [[submersion]] of compact smooth manifolds, the push-forward map along it is reduced to the [above](#KKPushForwardAlongEmbedding) case of an embedding by 

1. using that by the [[Whitney embedding theorem]] every compact $X$ may be embedded into some $\mathbb{R}^{2q}$ such as to yield an embedding

   $$
     h \colon X \to Z \times \mathbb{R}^{2 q} 
   $$ 

1. using that there is a KK-equivalence 

   $$
     \iota^Z! \colon C(Z) \stackrel{\simeq_{KK}}{\to} C_0(Z \times \mathbb{R}^{2q})
     \,.
   $$

The resulting push-forward is then given by postcomposition in [[KK-theory]] with

$$
  \pi! \colon C(X) \stackrel{h!}{\to} C_0(Z \times \mathbb{R}^{2}q)
   \underoverset{\simeq_{KK}}{(\iota^Z!)^{-1}}{\to} 
  C(Z)
  \,.
$$

([BMRS 07, example 3.4](#BMRS07))


#### Along a general K-oriented map
 {##KKPushforwardAlongGeneralMap}

Now for $f \colon X \to Y$ an arbitray [[K-orientation|K-oriented]] smooth proper map, we may reduce push-forward along it to the above two cases by factoring it through its [[graph map]], followed by projection to $Y$:

$$
  f \;\colon\;
  X \stackrel{graph(f)}{\to}
  X \times Y
  \stackrel{p_Y}{\to}
  Y
  \,.
$$

Hence push-forward along such a general map is postcomposition in [[KK-theory]] with

$$
  f! \coloneqq p_Y !\circ graph(f)!
  \,.
$$

([BMRS 07, example 3.5](#BMRS07))


## Examples

### To the point

When $B$ is a point, one obtains integration aginst the [[fundamental class]] of $E$, 
$$
\int_E:H^\bullet(E)\to H^{\bullet-dim E}(*)
$$
taking values in the coefficients of the given cohomology theory. Note that in this case $\Sigma^n B_+=S^n$, and this hints to a relationship between the Thom-Pontryagin construction and [[Spanier-Whitehead duality]]. And indeed [[Atiyah duality]] gives a homotopy equivalence between the [[Thom spectrum]] of the stable normal bundle of $E$ and the Spanier-Whitehead dual of $E$.
