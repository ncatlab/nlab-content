## Quotes

### On scepticism
 {#OnScepticism}

From the [last interview](#AWayOfThinking):

> [3:25](https://youtu.be/U8HEwO-2L4w?t=205) There's two kinds of dangers. One is what I just talked about. That we've arranged a society based on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power, sooner or later, is going to blow up in our faces. I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don't know anything about it? 

> [3:51](https://youtu.be/U8HEwO-2L4w?t=231) And the second reason that I'm worried about this is that science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking. A way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. 

> [4:07](https://youtu.be/U8HEwO-2L4w?t=247) If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we're up for grabs for the next charlatan political or religious who comes ambling along. 

> [4:27](https://youtu.be/U8HEwO-2L4w?t=267) It's a thing that Jefferson laid great stress on. It wasn't enough, he said, to enshrine some rights in a Constitution or a Bill of Rights. The people had to be educated, and they had to practice their skepticism and their education. Oherwise we don't run the governmentâ€”the government runs us.

cf. [[Richard Feynman]] [on doubt](Richard+Feynman#OnDoubt).

From [Sagan 1997, p. 33](#SaganDruyan97):

> science is more than a body of knowledge; it
is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...
