## Idea

What has been called the _Happy Family_ in [Griess 82](#Griess82) is the [[finite set]] of those 20 of the 26 [[sporadic finite simple groups]], which are [[subquotients]] of the [[monster group]], in contrast to the remaining 6 [[pariah groups]].

The _Happy Family_ is taken to be formed of three generations:

* First: five subgroups of the [[Mathieu group]] $M_{24}$ = symmetries of the [[binary Golay code]], namely the [[Mathieu groups]].
* Second: seven subquotients of the [[Conway group]] $Co_1$ = symmetries of the [[Leech lattice]], $mod \{\pm 1\}$, including the three simple [[Conway groups]].
* Third: eight subquotients of the [[Monster group]] = conformal symmetries of the [[monster vertex operator algebra]], including the [[Fischer groups]].
