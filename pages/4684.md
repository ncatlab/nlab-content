## Idea

A _topological manifold_ is a [[topological space]] (usually required to be [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]) which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [[metric topology]].

Often one is interested in extra structure on topological manifolds, that make them for instance into [[differentiable manifolds]] or [[smooth manifolds]] or [[analytic manifolds]] or [[complex manifolds]], etc. See at _[[manifold]]_ for more on the general concept.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #LocallyEuclideanSpace}
###### Definition
**(locally Euclidean topological space)**

A [[topological space]] $X$ is _locally Euclidean_ if every point $x \in X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]].

###### Remark
**(locally Euclidean spaces are $T_1$ but not necessarily $T_2$)**

It might superficially seem that every locally Euclidean space (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}) is necessarily a [[Hausdorff topological space]], since [[Euclidean space]], like any [[metric space]], is Hausdorff, and since by definition the neighbourhood of every point in a locally Euclidean spaces looks like Euclidean space.

But this is not so, see the counter-example \ref{NonHausdorffManifolds} below, Hausdorffness is a "non-local condition", as opposed to the $T_0$ and $T_1$ [[separation axioms]].

Every locally Euclidean space is $T_1$: Let $x \neq y$ be two distinct points in the locally Euclidean space. We need to show that there is an open neighbourhood $U_x$ around $x$ that does not contain $y$. By definition there is a Euclidean open neighbourhood $E_x$ around $y$. If this does not contain $y$, then we may set $U_x \coloneqq E_x$. If it does, then $x \neq y$ are two distinct point in this Euclidean space $E_x \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$. But Euclidean space is $T_1$, and hence we may find an open neighbourhood $U_x \subset E_x$ not intersecting $y$.

###### Definition
**(topological manifold)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]].

A _topological manifold_ of _[[dimension]] $n$_ (also "$n$-fold") is 

* a [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space]] $X$ 

such that 

* ("locally Euclidean") every point $x \in X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]].

###### Counter-Example
**([[non-Hausdorff manifolds]])**

An example of a [[topological space]] which is locally Euclidean as in def. \ref{TopologicalManifold} but a [[non-Hausdorff topological space]], and hence not a topological manifold in the usual sense, is the [[line with two origins]].

###### Definition
**([[local chart]] and [[atlas]] and [[gluing function]])

Given an $n$-dimensional topological manifold $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}), then

</div>


1. an [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ and a [[homeomorphism]] $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U$ is also called a _[[local coordinate chart]]_ of $X$.

1. an [[open cover]] of $X$ by local charts $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ is called an _[[atlas]]_ of the topological manifold.

1. denoting for each $i,j \in I$ the [[intersection]] of the $i$th chart with the $j$th chart in such an atlas by

   $$
     U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
   $$ 

   then the induced homeomorphism

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \supset
        \phantom{AA}
     \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_i\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     U_{i j}
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \phantom{AA}
       \subset
     \mathbb{R}^n
   $$

   is called the _[[gluing function]]_ from chart $i$ to chart $j$.

## Differentiable manifolds

+-- {: .num_defn #Differentiable manifold}
###### Definition
**([[differentiable manifold|differentiable]] and [[smooth manifolds]])**

For $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then a $p$-fold _[[differentiable manifold]]_ is 

1. a [[topological manifold]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold});

1. an [[atlas]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\}$ (def. \ref{Charts}) all whose [[gluing functions]]  are $p$ times continuously [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

A $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between $p$-fold differentiable manifolds 

$$
  (X, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I})
   \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  (Y, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J})
$$ 

is 

* a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ 

such that 

* for all $i \in I$ and $j \in J$ then 

  $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
     \supset
      \phantom{AA}
     (f\circ \phi_i)^{-1}(V_j)
       \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     f^{-1}(V_j)
      \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
     V_j
       \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
     \mathbb{R}^{n'}
  $$

  is a $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between open subsets of [[Euclidean space]].

=--

Notice that this in in general  a non-trivial condition even if $X = Y$ and $f$ is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.
