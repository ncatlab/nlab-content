## Idea

A _topological manifold_ is a [[topological space]] (usually required to be [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]) which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [[metric topology]].

Often one is interested in extra structure on topological manifolds, that make them for instance into [[differentiable manifolds]] or [[smooth manifolds]] or [[analytic manifolds]] or [[complex manifolds]], etc. See at _[[manifold]]_ for more on the general concept.

###### Definition
**(topological manifold)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]].

A _topological manifold_ of _[[dimension]] $n$_ (also "$n$-fold") is 

* a [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space]] $X$ 

such that 

* every point $x \in X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]].

###### Definition
**([[local chart]] and [[atlas]] and [[gluing function]])

Given an $n$-dimensional topological manifold $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}), then

1. an [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ and a [[homeomorphism]] $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U$ is also called a _[[local coordinate chart]]_ of $X$.

1. an [[open cover]] of $X$ by local charts $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ is called an _[[atlas]]_ of the topological manifold.

1. denoting for each $i,j \in I$ the [[intersection]] of the $i$th chart with the $j$th chart in such an atlas by

   $$
     U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
   $$ 

   then the induced homeomorphism

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \supset
        \phantom{AA}
     \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_i\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     U_{i j}
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \phantom{AA}
       \subset
     \mathbb{R}^n
   $$

   is called the _[[gluing function]]_ from chart $i$ to chart $j$.

###### Definition

For $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then a $p$-fold _[[differentiable manifold]]_ is 

1. a [[topological manifold]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold});

1. an [[atlas]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\}$ (def. \ref{Charts}) all whose [[gluing functions]]  are $p$ times continuously [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

A $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between $p$-fold differentiable manifolds $(X, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I})$ and $(Y, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\spi_j}{\to} V_j \subset\}_{j \in J})$ is a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ such that for all $x \in X$ and charts $U_i \supset \{x\}$, $V_j \supset \{y\}$ then 

$$
  \psi_j^{-1} circ f \circ \phi_i 
$$

is $p$-fold differentiable. 

For $p = \infty$ one speaks of [[smooth manifolds]] with [[smooth functions]] between them
