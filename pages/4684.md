## Idea

A _topological manifold_ is a [[topological space]] (usually required to be [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]) which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [[metric topology]].

Often one is interested in extra structure on topological manifolds, that make them for instance into [[differentiable manifolds]] or [[smooth manifolds]] or [[analytic manifolds]] or [[complex manifolds]], etc. See at _[[manifold]]_ for more on the general concept.

###### Definition
**([[locally Euclidean topological space]])**

A [[topological space]] $X$ is _[[locally Euclidean topological space|locally Euclidean]]_ if every point $x \in X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]]:

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n

  U_x
    \subset
  X

###### Proposition
**([[locally Euclidean spaces]] are $T_1$-[[separation axiom|separated]], [[sober topological space|sober]] and [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]])**

Let $X$ be a [[locally Euclidean space]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}). Then 

1. $X$ satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]];

1. $X$ is [[sober topological space|sober]];

1. $X$ is [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] in the sense that every open neighbourhood of a point contains a [[compact topological space|compact]] neighbourhood.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

Let $x \neq y$ be two distinct points in the locally Euclidean space. We need to show that there is an open neighbourhood $U_x$ around $x$ that does not contain $y$.

By definition, there is a Euclidean open neighbourhood $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U_x \subset X$ around $x$. If $U_x$ does not contain $y$, then it already is an open neighbourhood as required. If $U_x$ does contain $y$, then $\phi^{-1}(x) \neq \phi^{-1}(y)$ are equivalently two distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^n$. But Euclidean space, as every [[metric space]], is $T_1$, and hence we may find an open neighbourhood $V_{\phi^{-1}(x)} \subset \mathbb{R}^n $ not containing $\phi^{-1}(y)$. By the nature of the [[subspace topology]], $\phi(V_{\phi^{-1}(x)}) \subset X$ is an open neighbourhood as required.

Regarding the second statement:

We need to show that the map

$$
  Cl(\{-\}) \;\colon\; X \to IrrClSub(X)
$$

that sends points to the [[topological closure]] of their singleton sets is a [[bijection]] with the set of [[irreducible closed subsets]]. By the first statement above the map is [[injective function|injective]] (via [this lemma](separation+axioms#T1InTermsOfClosureOfPoints)). 

Hence it remains to see that every irreducible closed subset is the topological closure of a singleton. We will show something stronger: every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.

Let $P \subset X$ be an open proper subset such that if there are two open subsets $U_1, U_2 \subset X$ with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ then $U_1 \subset P$ or $U_2 \subset P$. By [this prop.](irreducible+closed+subspace#OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible) we need to show that there exists a point $x \in X$ such that $P = X \setminus \{x\}$ it its [[complement]].

Now since $P \subset X$ is a proper subset, and since the locally Euclidean space $X$ is covered by Euclidean neighbourhoods, there exists a Euclidean neighbourhood $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U \subset X$ such that $P \cap U \subset U$ is a proper subset. In fact this still satisfies the condition that for $U_1, U_2 \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} U$ then $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P \cap U$ implies $U_1 \subset P \cap U$ or $U_2 \subset P \cap U$. Accordingly, by [that prop.](irreducible+closed+subspace#OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible) it follows that $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \phi^{-1}(P \cap U)$ is an irreducible closed subset of [[Euclidean space]]. Sine [[metric spaces]] are [[sober topological space]] as well as $T_1$-[[separation axiom|separated]], this means that there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\phi^{-1}(P \cap U) = \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{x\}$. 

In conclusion this means that the restriction of an irreducible closed subset in $X$ to any Euclidean chart is either empty or a singleton set. This means that the irreducible closed subset must be a disjoint union of singletons that are separated by Euclidean neighbourhoods. But by irreducibiliy, this union has to consist of just one point.

Regarding the third statement:

Let $x \in X$ be a point and let $U_x \supset \{x\}$ be an open neighbourhood. We need to find a compact nighbourhood $K_x \subset U_x$.

By assumption there exists a Euclidean open neighbourhood $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} V_x \subset X$. By definition of the [[subspace topology]] the intersection $U_x \cap V_x$ is still open as a subspace of $V_x$ and hence $\phi^{-1}(U_x \cap V_x)$ is an open neighbourhood of $\phi^{-1}(x)  \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

Since Euclidean spaces are locally compact, there exists a compact neighbourhood $K_{\phi^{-1}(x)} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (for instance a sufficiently small [[closed ball]] around $x$, which is compact by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]]). Now since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]], it follows that also $\phi(K) \subset X$ is a compact neighbourhood.

=--

But the "global" topological properties of Euclidean space are not generally inherited by locally Euclidean spaces. This sounds obvious, but notice that also Hausdorff-ness is a "global property":

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(locally Euclidean spaces are not necessarily $T_2$)**

It might superficially seem that every locally Euclidean space (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}) is necessarily a [[Hausdorff topological space]], since [[Euclidean space]], like any [[metric space]], is Hausdorff, and since by definition the neighbourhood of every point in a locally Euclidean spaces looks like Euclidean space.

But this is not so, Hausdorffness is a "non-local condition".

###### Proposition
**(equivalence of regularity conditions for Hausdorff  locally Euclidean spaces)**

Let $X$ be a [[locally Euclidean space]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}) which is [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]].

Then the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]] and has a [[countable set]] of [[connected components]],

1. $X$ is [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]].

1. $X$ is [[second-countable topological space|second countable]]

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $X$ be sigma-compact. We show that then $X$ is second-countable.

By sigma-compactness there exists a [[countable set]] $\{K_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of compact subspaces. By $X$ being locally Euclidean, each admits an [[open cover]] by restrictions of [[Euclidean spaces]]. By their compactness, each of these has a subcover $\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_{i,j}}{\to} X \}_{j \in J_i}$ with $J_i$ a finite set. Since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]], we have obtained  a countable cover by Euclidean spaces $\{ \mathbb{R}^n  \overset{\phi_{i,j}}{\to} X\}_{i \in I, j \in J_i}$. Now Euclidean space itself is second countable (by [this example](second-countable+space#SecondCountableEuclideanSpace)), hence admits a countable set $\beta_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ of base open sets. As a result the union $\underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J_i}}{\cup} \phi_{i,j}(\beta_{\mathbb{R}^n})$ is a base of opens for $X$. But this is a countable union of countable sets, and since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]] we have obtained a countable base for the topology of $X$. This means that $X$ is second-countable.

Let $X$ be sigma-compact. We show that then $X$ is paracompact with a countable set of connected components:

By prop. \ref{LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace} every locally Euclidean space is locally compact, and since $X$ as assumed to be Hausdorff, this holds for all of the variants of definition of local compactness, by [this prop.](locally+compact+topological+space#InHausdorffSpacesDefinitionsOfLocalCompactnessAgree) Since [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]], it follows that $X$ is paracompact. Since, by the above, $X$ is also second-countable, it cannot have an uncountable set of connected components.

### Topological manifold


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalManifold}
###### Definition
**([[topological manifold]])**

A _topological manifold is a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[locally Euclidean topological space|locally Euclidean]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}),

1. [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space|paracompact Hausdorff]].

If the local [[Euclidean spaces|Euclidean]] neighbourhoods $\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} U \subset X$ are all of [[dimension]] $n$
for a fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then the topological manifold is said to be of dimension $n$, too. This is usually assumed to be the case. Sometimes one also says _$n$-fold_ for "$n$-dimensional manifold".

+-- {: .num_defn #Charts}
###### Definition
**([[local chart]] and [[atlas]] and [[gluing function]])

Given an $n$-dimensional topological manifold $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}), then

1. an [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ and a [[homeomorphism]] $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U$ is also called a _[[local coordinate chart]]_ of $X$.

1. an [[open cover]] of $X$ by local charts $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ is called an _[[atlas]]_ of the topological manifold.

1. denoting for each $i,j \in I$ the [[intersection]] of the $i$th chart with the $j$th chart in such an atlas by

   $$
     U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
   $$ 

   then the induced homeomorphism

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \supset
        \phantom{AA}
     \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_i\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     U_{i j}
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \phantom{AA}
       \subset
     \mathbb{R}^n
   $$

   is called the _[[gluing function]]_ from chart $i$ to chart $j$.

## Differentiable manifolds

+-- {: .num_defn #Differentiable manifold}
###### Definition
**([[differentiable manifold|differentiable]] and [[smooth manifolds]])**

For $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then a $p$-fold _[[differentiable manifold]]_ is 

1. a [[topological manifold]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold});

1. an [[atlas]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\}$ (def. \ref{Charts}) all whose [[gluing functions]]  are $p$ times continuously [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

A $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between $p$-fold differentiable manifolds 

$$
  (X, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I})
   \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  (Y, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J})
$$ 

is 

* a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ 

such that 

* for all $i \in I$ and $j \in J$ then 

  $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
     \supset
      \phantom{AA}
     (f\circ \phi_i)^{-1}(V_j)
       \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     f^{-1}(V_j)
      \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
     V_j
       \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
     \mathbb{R}^{n'}
  $$

  is a $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between open subsets of [[Euclidean space]].

=--

Notice that this in in general  a non-trivial condition even if $X = Y$ and $f$ is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.
