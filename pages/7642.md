## Idea

The naive [[2-category]] $Cat(S)$ of [[internal categories]] in a category $S$ does not have enough [[equivalences]] in general, due to the failure of the [[axiom of choice]] in $S$. The [[functors]] which _should_ be equivalences are called **weak equivalences**, and one often works with the [[bicategory of fractions|localisation]] of $Cat(S)$ at the weak equivalences. Roughly speaking, a weak equivalence is a functor which is 'fully faithful' and 'essentially surjective', but these terms need to be interpreted appropriately.

The concept of weak equivalences first arose in work of Bunge and Paré on stack completions of internal categories.

## Definition


Let $f:X\to Y$ be a functor between categories internal to some category $S$. $f$ is **fully faithful** if the following diagram is a pullback
$$
\begin{matrix}
  X_1& \stackrel{f_1}{\to} & Y_1 \\
  \downarrow&& \downarrow \\
  X_0\times X_0 &\underset{f_0\times f_0}{\to} & Y_0\times Y_0
\end{matrix}
$$

To discuss the analogue of essential surjectivity, we need a notion of 'surjectivity', as this does not generalise cleanly from $Set$. If we are working in a topos, a natural choice is to take epimorphisms, but weaker ambient categories are sometimes needed. A natural choice is to work in a unary [[site]], where the covers are taken as the 'surjective' maps.

Given a functor $f:X\to Y$ internal to a unary site $(S,J)$, $f$ is **essentially $J$-surjective** if the map $t\circ pr_2:X_0 \times_{f_0,Y_0,s}Y_1 \to Y_0$ is a $J$-cover.

We then define an internal functor to be a **$J$-equivalence** if it is fully faithful and essentially $J$-surjective.
