## Idea

**Tambara functors** are algebraic structures similar to [[Mackey functors]], but with multiplicative norm maps as well as additive transfer maps, and a rule governing their interaction. They were introduced by Tambara, as TNR-functors, to encode the relationship between Trace (additive transfer), Norm (multiplicative transfer) and Restriction maps in the representation theory and cohomology theory of finite groups ([Tam93](#Tam93)).



## Examples

Burnside rings, representation rings, homotopy groups of equivariant $E_{\infty}$-ring spectra in stable homotopy theory.

Some other examples are related to [[Witt-Burnside functors]], Witt rings in the sense of Dress and Siebeneicher.
