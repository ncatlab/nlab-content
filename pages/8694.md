## Definition

The [[electromagnetic field]] on a [[spacetime]] $X$ is mathematically modeled by a [[circle bundle with connection]] $\nabla$ on $X$. If the underlying bundle is trivial, or else on local [[coordinate patches]] $\mathbb{R}^n \hookrightarrow X$ over which it is so, this [[connection on a bundle|connection]] is equivalently a [[differential 1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$. 

This is then called the **electromagnetic potential** of the [[electromagnetic field]] (sometimes: "vector potential" or "[[gauge potential]] of the electromagnetic field"). 

Its [[de Rham differential]]

$$
  F \coloneqq \mathbf{d}A
$$

is the actual [[field strength]] of the electromagnetic field.

On a 4-dimensiona [[Minkowski spacetime]] with its canonical [[coordinates]] $\{t,x^1, x^2, x^3\}$, the electromagnetic potential $A$ is naturally expanded into corredinate components, traditionally written as

$$
  A = \phi \mathbf{d}t + A_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 + A_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 + A_3 \mathbf{d}x^3
  \,.
$$

Here 

* $\phi$ is the **electric potential** 

* $\vec A = [A_1, A_2, A_3]$ is the **magnetic potential** 

(for this choice of [[coordinates]]).
