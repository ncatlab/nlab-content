## Idea

Applying a certain regularization prescription to the [[action functional]] of the [[superstring]] [[sigma-model]] it turns into a [[theory (physics)|theory]] whose [[field (physics)|fields]] are [[Lie algebra]] elements -- [[matrices]] for the case of [[matrix Lie algebras]] -- known as the [[IKKT matrix model]].

A similar regularization to the [[action functional]] of the [[membrane]] (the [[M2-brane]]) would have to involve objects replacing matrices which instead of a binary [[Lie bracket]] $[-,-]$ have a trinary [[Nambu bracket|Nambu]]-like bracket $[-,-,-]$. ([Park-Sochichiu 08](#ParkSochichiu08), [Sato09](#Sato09), [DeBellis-Saemann-Szabo 11](#DeBellisSaemannSzabo11)).

Given the relation of the [[IKKT matrix model]] to [[type IIB string theory]] it is naturally and often expected that making sense of this might give a way to understand [[M-theory]] (whence the title for instance of ([Sato 09](#Sato09))). 

For this to work a clear understanding of the nature of these trinary brackets is required. After the success of the [[BLG model]] for the [[M2-brane]] several authors proposed that these are to be thought of as Flippov "[[3-Lie algebras]]" ([Park-Sochichiu 08](#ParkSochichiu08), [Sato09](#Sato09), [DeBellis-Saemann-Szabo 11](#DeBellisSaemannSzabo11)). However, by the discussion there, following ([MFFMER 08](n-Lie+algebra#MFFMER08)) it seems natural to think of "3-Lie algebras" as really being [[Lie 2-algebras]] equipped with a binary [[invariant polynomial]].

Accordingly, a membrane matrix model should be a generalization of the [[IKKT matrix model]] from [[Lie algebras]] to [[Lie 2-algebras]]. This proposal is explored in ([Ritter-Saemann 13](#RitterSaemann13)).
