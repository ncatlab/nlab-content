Name __ring theory__ usually refers to the subject of study of classical (not necessarily commutative) rings, unital or not and often also of modules over them. 

Some of the related entries in nlab include [[noetherian ring]], [[prime spectrum]], [[commutative algebra]], [[prime ideal]], [[ideal]], [[filter]], [[Ore set]], [[Gabriel filter]], [[primitive ideal]]. 

Generalizations of rings include $\Omega$-[[Omega-group|groups]], [[generalized rings]] in the sense of Durov, [[associative algebra|associative $k$-algebras]]; moreover [[additive categories]] can be considered as a horizontal categorification of unital rings; and once upon a time they were called _rings with many objects_.
