## Idea

* In an [[abelian group]] $A$, the group operation is often called a _sum_ (or descriptively _additive operation_) and written "additively" $a,b \in A \;\vdash\; (a + b) \in A$; in fact it is a convention to call it a sum in those cases when it is denoted additively. In the case of numbers or vectors (and generalizations) a suitable notion when passing to the limit of an "infinite sum" is [[integral]]. There are however also noncommutative integrals when the order of summation/multiplication of noncommuting quantities is taken into account. 

* In a [[category]] the term _sum_ may refer to the [[coproduct]] of two [[objects]].

* In a [[poset]] this becomes the notion of [[join]] and [[union]].

* A more general notion of sum in [[category theory]] is that of _[[dependent sum]]_ of a family of objects.
