## Idea

* In an [[abelian group]] $A$, the group operation is called a _sum_ and written $a,b \in A \;\vdash\; (a + b) \in A$. A suitable limiting notion is that of [[integral]].

* In a [[category]] the term _sum_ may refer to the [[coproduct]] of two [[objects]].

* In a [[poset]] this becomes the notion of [[join]] and [[union]].

* A more general notion of sum in [[category theory]] is that of _[[dependent sum]]_ of a family of objects.
