## Definition 

Let $k$ be a [[field]], and $p \in k[x]$ a [[monic polynomial]] of degree $n$. A _splitting field_ for $p$ is a [[field extension]] $i: k \hookrightarrow E$ such that, regarding $p$ as a polynomial in $E[x]$ by applying the map 

$$k[x] \cong k \otimes_k k[x] \stackrel{i \otimes 1}{\to} E \otimes_k k[x] \cong E[x],$$ 

the polynomial factors or "splits" as a product of linear factors (possibly repeated): 

$$p(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)\ldots (x - r_n)$$ 

with all the [[roots]] $r_i$ lying in $E$, and the smallest subfield of $E$ containing $k$ and these roots is $E$ itself (so that the roots generate $E$: $E = k(r_1, \ldots, r_n)$. 

More generally, given a set $S \subseteq k[x]$ of polynomials, an extension field $E/k$ for which each $p \in S$ splits over $E$, and which as a field is generated over $k$ by the set of accompanying roots, is called a splitting field for $S$. 

## Construction 

The existence of a splitting field may be given quite abstractly as follows. Introduce a set of indeterminates $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ and let $R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be the polynomial algebra. In the [[polynomial|polynomial algebra]] $R[t] = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n, t]$, write 

$$p(t) - \prod_{i=1}^n (t - x_i) = \sum_{j = 0}^{n-1} s_j t^j$$ 

where the $s_j$ belong to $R$. The [[ideal]] $(s_1, \ldots, s_n)$ of $R$ generated by the $s_j$ is contained in some [[maximal ideal]] $m$. The quotient ring $R/m$ is a field $E$, where the images of the indeterminates $x_i$ under the quotient map $R \to R/m$ are the desired roots $r_i \in E$ of $p$. It is clear that $E$ is a field extension of $k$ generated by these roots (since the $x_i$ generate $R$).

###### Theorem 
Splitting fields are unique up to (non-unique) [[isomorphism]].

###### Proof 
Suppose $E = k(r_1, \ldots, r_n)$ and $E' = k(r_1', \ldots, r_n')$ are two splitting fields of a polynomial $p \in k[x]$. The [[tensor product]] $E \otimes_k E'$ is a [[coproduct]] of $E$ and $E'$ in the category of [[commutative algebras]] over $k$; let $i: E \to E \otimes_k E'$ and $i': E' \to E \otimes_k E'$ be the coproduct injections. Observe that as a $k$-algebra, $E \otimes_k E'$ is generated by the $i(r_j)$ together with the $i'(r_j')$. 

Now let $m$ be any maximal ideal of $E \otimes_k E'$, and consider the composite 

$$\phi = (E \stackrel{i}{\to} E \otimes_k E' \stackrel{quot}{\to} E \otimes_k E'/m).$$ 

As is the case for any homomorphism between fields, this composite $\phi$ is an [[injective map]]. Moreover, letting $\rho_j$ denote the coset $i(r_j) + m$ and $\rho_j'$ the coset $i'(r_j') + m$, the polynomial $p(x)$ splits over the field $E \otimes_k E'/m$ as 

$$\prod_j (x - \rho_j) = \prod_k (x - \rho_k')$$ 

and so by [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization]] of polynomials, for each $\rho_k'$ there is a $\rho_j = \phi(r_j)$ with $\rho_k' = \rho_j$. This means the $\phi(r_j)$ exhaust the generators $\rho_j, \rho_k'$ of $E \otimes_k E'/m$. In other words, $\phi$ is also surjective and provides an isomorphism $E \cong E \otimes_k E'/m$. By symmetry we also have an isomorphism $E' \cong E \otimes_k E'/m$, and thus $E \cong E'$.

The construction and proof of uniqueness up to isomorphism may be easily modified to deal with the splitting field of any set of polynomials, and indeed of the set of all polynomials over $k$ (viz., the [[algebraic closure]] of $k$).
