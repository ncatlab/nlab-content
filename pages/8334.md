## Idea

Despite of what one might expect, much of [[cosmology]] is based on [[classical physics]]. Certainly the [[standard model of particle physics]] is constructed from _classical [[gravity]]_, namely an [[FRW model]] solution to [[Einstein's equations]], which serves as a fixed "background" over which one considers in a [[semiclassical approximation]] [[quantum fields]], say to model the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].

On the one hand it is remarkable how well the [[standard model of cosmology]] built this way compares to available experimental data. On the other hand it is clear that a more precise model will need to take [[quantum field theory]] into acount more properly. In particular non-classical effects of [[quantum gravity]] will play a role at least close to the initial singularity, if not also for the explanation of the [[cosmological constant]] and other aspects of the [[standard model of cosmology]] which currently don't have a conceptual explanation in the model.

Such a more comprehensively quantum mechanical discussion of [[cosmology]] goes by the term **quantum cosmology**. 

However, despite the existence of this term, quantum cosmology is to a large extent only a hypothetical field of research. This is due to two major open conceptual problems of present day fundamental [[physics]]:

1. the nature of [[quantum gravity]] remains largely unsettled;

1. the very formulations of [[quantum mechanics]]/[[quantum field theory]] available all require, more or less explicitly and to lesser or greater extent, an _external classical observer_ to make sense of the predictions of the theory. This makes sense, in principle, for every subsysten of the [[observable universe]]. But a comprehensive theory of "quantum cosmology" would seem to need a notion of [[observables]] of quantum phenomena by "quantum observers" _internal_ to the quantum system which they observe, instead of by "classical observers" external to that quantum system.

Despite various attempts and proposals for how to proceed with these problems the issue remains essentially unsolved and mysterious.
