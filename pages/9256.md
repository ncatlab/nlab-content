## Overview

*Computational topology* is a relatively new area of study. It emerged in response to topological problems that arise in computer graphics, robotics and planning. There are interactions with dynamical systems, and computational geometry.


## Subareas

* [[computational homology]]
* [[persistent homology]]

* [[topological data analysis]]

* [[topological  dynamics]]

* [[topological analysis of networks of sensors]]

* [[discrete Morse theory]]

Related areas include

* [[computational homological algebra]]
