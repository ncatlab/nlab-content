### Motivation and results

Consider $(X,g)$ a [[super-spacetime]] and $\omega$ a degree $(p+2)$-differential form on $X$ which is a [[geometry of physics -- WZW terms|WZW]] [[curvature form]]  [[definite form|definite]] on the [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|cocycle]] $\overline \psi \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_p$ for [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma models]] with [[target space]] $X$.  Then the [Polyvector extensions](super+Poincare+Lie+algebra#PolyvectorExtensions)  

$$
  [Q_\alpha, Q_\beta] = (\Gamma^a C)_{\alpha\beta} P_a + (\Gamma^{a_1\cdots a_p}C)_{\alpha \beta} Z_{a_1\cdots a_p}
$$

of the [[super Lie algebra]] of [[super-isometries]]  of $(X,g)$ by [[charges]] $Z$ of [[conserved currents]] of the [[super p-brane sigma model]] are known as algebras of _[[BPS charges]]_. (The spacetime $(X,g,\omega)$ is called a _[[supergravity]] $\frac{1}{k}$-[[BPS state]]_ if the dimension of the space of [[supercharges]] $Q$ that gives 0 under the above bracket is $\frac{1}{k}$th of that of [[super Minkowski spacetime]]). 

This is well understood in the literature ([Azcárraga-Gauntlett-Izquierdo-Townsend 89](#AGIT89)) for the case that $X$ is locally modeled on an ordinary [[super Minkowski spacetime]] and that the $p$-brane species is in the _old_ [[brane scan]] (the [[string]] in dimensions $3,4,6,10$, the [[membrane]] in dimensions $4,5,7,11$, also the [[3-brane in 6d]]). 

But in [[string theory]] this needs to be refined in three ways (see [[schreiber:The brane bouquet|Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13]]), and this has been left open in the literature, for previous lack of a [[higher differential geometry]] that could handle this:

1. for a genuine global definition of the [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma model]] with target $(X,\omega)$, the WZW [[curvature]] form $\omega$ needs to be [[prequantization|prequantized]] to a globally well-defined [[geometry of physics -- WZW terms|WZW term]], a genuine [[cocycle]] in [[Deligne cohomology]] (a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (p1+1)-bundle with connection]])

   (the need for this has broadly been ignored, one place where it is mentioned is ([Witten 86, p. 17](#Witten86)))

1. for the inclusion of $p_2$-brane charges of $p_2$-branes on which $p_1$-branes may end (for $p_1 = 1$: [[type II strings]] ending on [[D-branes]], for $p_1= 2$ and $p_2 = 5$ [[M2-branes]] ending on [[M5-branes]]) then $X$ is to be locally modeled on an [[extended super Minkowski spacetime]], hence on a [[super formal smooth infinity-groupoid|super orbispace]], hence a curved spacetime now is an object not just in [[super Cartan geometry|super]] [[higher Cartan geometry]] 

   (arguments in this direction for the [[D-branes]] have been given in ([Hammer 97](BPS+state#Hammer97)) and for the [[M5-brane]] in ([Sorokin-Townsend 97](BPS+state#SorokinTownsend97)).)

1. for inclusion of non-infinitesimal isometries one needs the global structure of the full [[supergroup]] of BPS charges, not just its [[super Lie algebra]].

Here we discuss how to solve these problems in full generality. Specified to the situation in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] with [[M2-branes]] and [[M5-branes]] we find that the BPS charges traditionally seen in the [[M-theory super Lie algebra]] as living in [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^5(X) \oplus H^2(X)$ receive corrections by $d_4$-differentials of a [[Serre spectral sequence]] given by [[cup product]] with the class of the [[supergravity C-field]] in higher analogy to how [[D-brane charges]] are well known ([Maldacena-Moore-Seiberg 01](D-brane#MaldacenaMooreSeiberg01)) to be in [[ordinary cohomology]] only up to corrections of $d_3$-differential (and higher) in an [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] for [[twisted K-theory]],given by [[cup product]] with the class of the [[B-field]]. This supports the conjecture ([Sati 10](M5-brane+charge#Sati10)) that [[M5-brane charge]] should really be in [[twisted generalized cohomology|twisted]] [[elliptic cohomology]], since this is canonically twisted by these degree-4 classes [Ando-Blumberg-Gepner 10](tmf#ABG10).

We also close a gap in ([AGIT89](#AGIT89)): what is strictly derived there from the [[Noether theorem]] is extension by [[differential forms]], while the argument that it is really the [[de Rham cohomology]] class of these forms that matters relies on physics intuition. We find here that the [[Lie algebra]] of [[conserved currents]] extending the (super-)isometry algebra is naturally not just a ([[super Lie algebra|super-]])[[Lie algebra]] but a ([[super L-infinity algebra|super-]])[[Lie n-algebra]] including higher order symmetries  of Noether symmetries. It is by quotienting these out when restricting the current Lie $n$-algebra to its lowest [[Postnikov tower|Postnikov stage]] that current forms pass to their de Rham equivalence classes.  Accordingly, the fully globalized current groups that we find are really ([[super smooth infinity-groupoid|super-]])[[smooth infinity-group|smooth n-groups]]. For instance the [[M-theory super Lie algebra]] is refines to a super Lie 6-group, where $6 = 5+1$ is the dimension of the [[M5-brane]] [[worldvolume]].

$\,$

We formulate the theory general abstractly in  the context of [[higher differential geometry]] given by an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ equipped with [[cohesion]] and [[differential cohesion]]. The application to [[supergravity]] takes place in the model $\mathbf{H} =$ [[SuperFormalSmooth∞Grpd]].

###### Definition

Given $V,E\in \mathbf{H}$, a _$V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]]_ $E$ over $X$ is a [[bundle]] $E \in \mathbf{H}_{/X}$ such that there exists a [[cover]] (i.e. a [[1-epimorphism]]) $U \longrightarrow X$ and a [[homotopy pullback]] [[diagram]] of the form

A $V$-fiber bundle realized this way is said to have _structure group_ $G$.

###### Definition

Given a $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $P$ [[modulating morphism|modulated]] by some $\mathbf{c}\colon X \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}G$, and given a [[homomorphism]] of [[∞-groups]] $H \hookrightarrow$, then a _[[reduction and lift of structure groups|reduction/lift of the structure group]]_ is a lift $\hat {\mathbf{c}}$ in

###### Definition

Given an $F$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] $E$ over $X$, and a [[global element]] $x\colon \ast \to F$ then a [[section]] $\sigma$ of $E$ is _definite on $x$ if

###### Proposition

Choices of sections definite on $x$ are equivalent to [[reduction of structure groups|reductions of the structure group]], def. \ref{ReductionLiftOfStructureGroup}, along the [[stabilizer group]] map $Stab_\mathbf{Aut}(V)(x)\longrightarrow \mathbf{Aut}(V)$.

+-- {: .num_defn #DefiniteParameterization}
###### Definition

Given $\mathbf{c} \colon V \longrightarrow A$, and given a $V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] $E$ over $X$, then a _definite parameterization of $\mathbf{c}$ over $E$_ is a $\mathbf{c}^E \colon E \longrightarrow A$ such that the section $\sigma_{\mathbf{c}^X}$ coresponding to it via prop. \ref{FunctionsOnTotalSpacesAreSectionsOfFunctionBundle} is definite on $\mathbf{c}$ in the sense of def. \ref{DefiniteSection}.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #DefiniteGlobalization}
###### Definition

For $V$ an [[∞-group]], $\mathbf{L}\colon V \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}$ a [[geometry of physics -- WZW terms|WZW term]], and for $X$ a $V$-[[geometry of physics -- manifolds and orbifolds]], then a _[[definite globalization of WZW terms|definite globalization]]_ of $\mathbf{L}$ over $X$ is 

1. A [[reduction of the structure group]], def. \ref{ReductionLiftOfStructureGroup}, of the [[frame bundle]] of $X$ along $\mathbf{Aut}_{Grp}(V)$;

1. an $\mathbf{L}^X \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}$ such that its pullback $T_{inf} X \to X \stackrel{\mathbf{L}^X}{\longrightarrow} \mathbf{B} \mathb{G}_{conn}$ to the [[infinitesimal disk bundle]] of $X$ is definite, def. \ref{DefiniteParameterization}, on $\mathbf{L}|_{\mathbb{D}^V} \in \mathbb{G}\mathbf{Conn}(\mathbb{D}^V)$, def. \ref{DifferentialConcretification}.

Since, according to prop. \ref{DefiniteSectionsAndReductionOfStructureGroup}, the second item in def. \ref{DefiniteGlobalization} implies a [[reduction of the structure group|lift/reduction of the structure group]] to $\mathbf{QuantMorph}(\mathbf{L}|_{\mathbb{D}^V})$, in total this requires a reduction/lift to the [[Heisenberg ∞-group]]

$$
  G =
  \mathbf{Heis}_{\mathbf{Aut}_{grp}(\mathbb{D}^V)}(\mathbf{L}|_{\mathbb{D}^V})
  \coloneqq
  \mathbf{QuantMorp}(\mathbf{L}|_{\mathbb{D}^V})
  \underset{\mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^V)}{\times}
  \mathbf{Aut}_{Grp}(\mathbb{D}^V)
 \,.
$$

This [[G-structure]] we require to be [[integrable G-structure|first order integrable] (with respect to the canonical left-invariant [[framed manifold|framing]] of $V$.)

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

In $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SuperFormalSmooth∞Grpd]] and for $V$ being [[super Minkowski spacetime]] of bosonic [[dimension]] $d = 3,4,10,11$ regarded as the [[supersymmetry]] [[super-translation group]] in that dimension, and for $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{L}$ the WZW term induced by differential Lie integration ([here](geometry+of+physics+--+WZW+terms#WZWTermFromLieIntegration))
 from the [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|cocycles]] of the [[brane scan]] in these dimensions, then the [[Heisenberg ∞-group]] in def. \ref{DefiniteGlobalization} is a $\mathbf{B}(\mathbb{R}/\Gamma)$-[[∞-group extension]] of the [[Lorentz group]] in these dimensions.

This means that a choice of definite globalization of $\mathbf{L}_{string}$ over a [[supermanifold]] $X$ is in particular a choice of super-[[orthogonal structure]], hence a choice of [[graviton]] and of a [[gravitino]] [[field (physics)|field]]. 

The condition that this [[G-structure]] be first-order integrable with respect to the canonical left-invariant framing of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] then means that the [[supertorsion]] of this orthogonal structure vanishes.

For $d = 1$ this is the [[torsion constraint of supergravity]]. By ([Howe 97](torsion+constraints+in+supergravity#Howe97)) this implies that the above graviton and gravitino field satisfy the [[Einstein equations]] for bosonic backgrounds of [[11-dimensional supergravity]].

This in turn implies in particular that the [[curvature]] of the WZW term $\mathbf{L}$ is the fermionic component of the [[supergravity C-field]] [[field strength]]. This finally means that $\mathbf{L}$ itself is a consistent choice of [[prequantization]] of this hence a genuinely globally defined WZW term for the [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] for the [[M2-brane]] with [[target space]] $X$.

###### Definition

Given a definite globalization $\mathbf{L} \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}$ of a WZW term, def. \ref{DefiniteGlobalization}, hence in particular a [[G-structure]] $\mathbf{g}$ on $X$ for $G =
  \mathbf{Heis}_{\mathbf{Aut}_{grp}(\mathbb{D}^V)}(\mathbf{L}|_{\mathbb{D}^V})$, then the corresponding _BPS charge group_ is the [[Heisenberg n-group]] of $\mathbf{L}^X$ over the [[isometry group]] of this $G$-structure:

$$
  BPS(X,\mathbf{g}, \mathbf{L})
  \coloneqq
  \mathbf{Heis}_{\mathbf{Iso}(X,\mathbf{g})}(\mathbf{L})

###### Proposition

For $V$ [[super Minkowski spacetime]], then the [[super L-infinity algebra]] of $BPS(X,\mathbf{g}, \mathbf{L})$ is the [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra]] of $\omega = F_{\mathbf{L}}$ regarded as a [[pre-n-plectic form]] on $X$. This is an $L_\infty$-algebra extension of the
