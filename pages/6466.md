# Real numbers object

##Idea

Recall that it is possible to define an [[internalization]] of the natural numbers, called a [[natural numbers object]] (NNO), in any [[category]] with finite [[product|products]]. In particular, the notion makes sense in a [[topos]]. But a topos supports [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[higher-order logic]], so once we have an NNO, it is also possible to repeat the usual construction of the [[integer|integers]], the [[rational number|rationals]], and then finally the [[real number|real numbers]]; we thus obtain an internalization of $\mathbb{R}$ in any topos with an NNO.

##Definition

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an [[elementary topos]] with a natural numbers object $\mathbb{N}$. The **Dedekind real numbers object** of $\mathcal{E}$ is the object of all  [[Dedekind cut|Dedekind cuts]]. To be more precise, we will need to make some auxiliary definitions.

We first construct an integers object as follows. Let $a, b : E \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ be the [[kernel pair]] of the addition map $+ : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, and let $\pi_1, \pi_2 : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be the [[product]] projections. We define $\mathbb{Z}$ to be the [[coequalizer]] of $(\pi_1 \circ a, \pi_2 \circ b), (\pi_2 \circ a, \pi_1 \circ b) : E \to \mathbb{N}$. A similar construction yields a rational numbers object $\mathbb{Q}$. 

We denote by $\mathcal{P}(A)$ the [[power object]] of $A$ in $\mathcal{E}$. A **Dedekind cut** is a [[generalized element]] $(L, U)$ of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q}) \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q})$, satisfying the following conditions, expressed in the [[Mitchell-Benabou language|Mitchell-Bénabou language]] of $\mathcal{E}$ and interpreted under [[Kripke-Joyal semantics]]:

1. (Non-degeneracy) $\exists q \in \mathbb{Q} . \, q \in L$ and $ \exists r \in \mathbb{Q} . \, r \in U$

1. (L is downward-closed) $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q} . \, \forall r \in \mathbb{Q} . \, ((q \lt r \wedge r \in L) \implies q \in L)$ <br /> (R is upward-closed) $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q} . \, \forall r \in \mathbb{Q} . \, ((r \lt q) \wedge (r \in U) \implies q \in U)$

1. (L is downward-open) $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q} . \, ((q \in L) \implies \exists r \in \mathbb{Q} . \, ((r \in L) \wedge (q \lt r)))$ <br /> (R is upward-open) $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q} . \, (q \in U \implies \exists r \in \mathbb{Q} . \, ((r \in L) \wedge (r \lt q)))$

1. (Dichotomy) $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q} . \, \forall r \in \mathbb{Q} . \, ((q \lt r) \implies (q \in L \vee r \in U))$

1. (Mutually exclusive) $L \cap U = \emptyset$

The relation $\lt$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ is the order relation constructed in the usual way. We define $\mathbb{R}$ to be the subobject of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q}) \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q})$ consisting of all Dedekind cuts as defined above.

##Properties

In any (elementary) topos with an NNO, $\mathbf{R}$ is a [[local ring]] object.

###As a sheaf on a topological space

Let $X$ be a topological space, and $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ its category of [[sheaf|sheaves]]. It is well-known that $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]] (and so, _a fortiori_, an elementary topos), and the [[constant sheaf]] [[functor]] $\Delta : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathrm{Sh}(X)$ preserves finite limits and has the [[global section]] functor $\Gamma : \mathrm{Sh}(X) \to \mathbf{Set}$ as a right adjoint. (Hence, $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$ are the components of a [[geometric morphism]] $\mathrm{Sh}(X) \to \mathbf{Set}$.) The following claims are essentially immediate:

1. If $\mathbf{N}$ is the set of natural numbers, then $\Delta (\mathbf{N})$ must be an NNO in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$, since $\Delta$ has a right adjoint. 

1. If $\mathbf{Z}$ is the set of integers, then $\Delta (\mathbf{Z})$ is an integers object in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ (as defined above), since $\Delta$ preserves finite limits and colimits.

1. Similarly, if $\mathbf{Q}$ is the set of rational numbers, then $\Delta (\mathbf{Q})$ is a rational numbers object in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$.

Thus, for every topological space $X$, the topos $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ has a Dedekind real numbers object $\mathbb{R}$. Naïvely one might expect $\mathbb{R}$ to be isomorphic to the constant sheaf $\Delta (\mathbf{R})$, where $\mathbf{R}$ is the classical set of real numbers, but this turns out not to be the case. Instead, we have a rather more remarkable result:

**Theorem.** A Dedekind real numbers object $\mathbb{R}$ in the topos $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ is isomorphic to the sheaf of real-valued continuous functions on $X$.

_Proof._ See [Mac Lane and Moerdijk](#MM94) (Chapter VI, §8).

This allows us to define various further constructions on $X$ in internal terms in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$; for example, a [[vector bundle]] over $X$ is an internal [[projective object|projective]] $\mathbb{R}$-[[module]].

##Generalizations

It is also possible to define several notions of a [[Cauchy real number]] in any topos with an NNO, but as the internal logic of toposes is in general intuitionistic, these are usually inequivalent.
