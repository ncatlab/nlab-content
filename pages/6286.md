## Idea

In [[quantum mechanics]], a _qausi-state_ on an [[algebra of observables]] $A$ is a [[function]] $\rho : A \to \mathbb{C}$ that is required to satisfy the axioms of a genuine [[state]] (linearity and positivity) only on the [[poset of commutative subalgebras]] of $A$.

While therefore the condition on quasi-states is much weaker than that for states, [[Gleason's theorem]] asserts that if $A = B(H)$ for $dim H \gt 2$, then all quasi-states are in fact states.

Notice that a quasi-state is naturally regarded as an actual state, but [[internalization|internal]] to the [[ringed topos]] over the [[poset of commutative subalgebras]] of $A$. Therefore Gleason's theorem is one of the motivations for regarding this ringed topos as the quantum [[phase space]] ("[[Bohrification]]".) The other is the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]].
