## Idea

The notion of [[complete Segal space]] is a model for the notion of [[(∞,1)-category]]. The [[model category]] structure on the collection of all [[bisimplicial set]]s is a model for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of all Segal spaces, hence for the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

###### Proposition
**(Rezk model structure)**

The category $[\Delta^{op}\times \Delta^{op}, Set]$ of [[bisimplicial set]]s is equipped with the structure of a 

* [[left proper model category|left proper]]

* [[cartesian closed category|cartesian]] [[monoidal model category|closed]]

* [[simplicial model category]] 

by setting

* cofibrations are the [[monomorphism]]s

* weak equivalences are the **Segal weak equivalences.

The fibrant objects in the structure are precisely the [[complete Segal space]]s.
