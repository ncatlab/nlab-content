##Idea

The **Acyclic Assembly Lemma** gives conditions for the [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] of [[modules]] over a ring to be acyclic.

A full statement and proof can be found in [[An Introduction to Homological Algebra]] by [[Charles Weibel|Chuck Weibel]] on pages 59 and 60 (Lemma 2.7.3).
