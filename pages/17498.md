## Definition

The **eventual image** of an [[endomorphism]] $f:A\to A$ is the [[intersection]] $\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} f^{(n)}(A)$ of the images of its [[iteration|iterates]].  This makes sense in many different [[categories]].

## Properties

On the category of [[finite sets]], the operation assigning to each endomorphism its eventual image is a [[dinatural transformation]].
