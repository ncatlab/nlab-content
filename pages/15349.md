##Idea##

An **étendue** (also 'etendue', or 'etendu'; from French 'L'étendue' (fem.) - _extent_) is a [[topos]] $\mathcal{Y}$ that locally looks like the category of sheaves on a space:
>Briefly, the slogan is that $\mathcal{Y}$ is locally a topological space. (Lawvere 1976, p.129)

##History##

Originally defined by [[A. Grothendieck]] in ([[SGA4]], p.482) as a topos $\mathcal{Y}$ that has a well-supported object $X$ such that the slice $\mathcal{Y}/X$ is equivalent to a sheaf topos on a topological space, the definition was generalized by [[Lawvere]] (1975a,1976) by dropping the spatiality of the slice and require only that $\mathcal{Y}/X$ is a [[localic topos]].


Several site characterizations of étendues are known which come in two flavors, the first being the cancellation property of having an 'all monic' site betraying the origin of the concept as a mild generalization of the concept of space, the second is tied to the 'groupoidalness' of the site. Both ideas were already present in SGA4.


Étendues play an important role in Lawvere's approach to [[cohesion]] and the petit/[[gros topos]] distinction, where they provide one of the classes of [[petit toposes]] (generalized spaces). In this context, Lawvere (1989a,1991) interprets the cancellative property of the site as enabling an interpretation of étendues as _categories of processes_. 

##Definition##

A topos $\mathcal{E}$ is called an _étendue_ if there is an object $X\in|\mathcal{E}|$ such that the (unique) $X\rightarrow 1$ is epic and the [[slice topos]] $\mathcal{E}/X$  is a [[localic topos]].[^fine]

[^fine]:  An epic $k:X\rightarrow 1$ induces a [[geometric morphism]] $k_\ast:\mathcal{E}/X\rightarrow \mathcal{E}/1$ whose inverse image part, the change of base functor, $k^\ast:\mathcal {E}/1\rightarrow\mathcal{E}/X$ is faithful, which means by definition that $k_\ast$ is a surjection, and one says that $\mathcal{E}/X$ _covers_ $\mathcal{E}$.

##Examples##


##Properties##

* **Proposition**. A Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{Y}$ is an étendue iff there exists a [[site]] $(\mathcal{C}, J)$ for $\mathcal{Y}$ such that every morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ is monic.

* A Grothendieck topos is a Boolean étendue precisely if it satisfies the _internal [[axiom of choice]]_ (i.e. $(\quad)^X$ preserves epics for all objects $X$ ). An example of such a Boolean étendue would be $Set^G$ for $G$ a group.
