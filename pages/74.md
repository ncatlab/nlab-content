## Idea 

**Enriched category theory** is the [[category theory]] of [[enriched categories]].

Pretty much every notion of ordinary category theory has its analog in enriched category theory, and, by taking the enriching category to be [[Set]], enriched category theory subsumes all of the theory of [[locally small categories]].

Enriched categories have a multitude of uses and applications, that makes studying their general theory quite worthwhile.

## Applications

### As a tool in higher category theory 

Enriched categories may be used to model objects in [[higher category theory]]: if the objects of the enriching category $V$ behave themselves as [[(n,r)-categories]], then a $V$-[[enriched category]] behaves like a (possibly special) $(n+1,r+1)$-category.

For instance 

* a [[Cat]]-enriched category is a [[strict 2-category]];

* since a [[simplicial set]] that is a [[Kan complex]] is a model for an [[∞-groupoid]], a [[Kan complex]]-enriched category is a model for an [[(∞,1)-category]];

* since a simplicial set that is a [[quasi-category]] is a model for an [[(∞,1)-category]], a quasi-category-enriched category is a model for an [[(∞,2)-category]].

In practice it is often useful to handle enriched categories such that only certain enriched [[full subcategories]] of them are the the desired models for objects in higher category theory. For instance often it is useful to work with general [[sSet-categories]] and have a prescription for how to find a [[Kan complex]]-enriched full subcategory inside them.

This is achieved notably by combining enriched category theory with [[model category]] theory:

an [[enriched model category]] or more generally an [[enriched homotopical category]] is an enriched category with extra information on how it behaves as a model in higher category. Notably [[sSet-model categories]] serve as models for [[(∞,1)-category theory]].
