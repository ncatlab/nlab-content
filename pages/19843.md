###Cauchy surfaces
There are two seemingly very different definitions for cauchy surfaces

###### Definition
Given a Spacetime $\mathcal{M}$ a closed subset $\Sigma\in\mathcal{M}$ is called \textit{cauchy surface} if:

1. (achronal) Time like curves in $\mathcal{M}$ intersect $\Sigma$ at most once.
2. () $\forall x\in\mathcal{M}$ all future- or past-inextensible causal curve passing through $x$ intersect $\Sigma$.
