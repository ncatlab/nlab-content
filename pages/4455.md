## Idea

While Dedekind completeness was traditionally described in the context of the [[real numbers]], it can be stated for any [[linear order]], although it really works best for [[dense order|dense]] and unbounded (without [[top]] or [[bottom]]) linear orders. Intuitively, a linear order is _Dedekind complete_ if [[Dedekind cuts]] don't give any 'new' elements.


## Definitions

Let $S$ be a [[set]] with a [[dense order|dense]] [[linear order]] $\lt$ without [[top]] or [[bottom]] elements.

###### Definition

A __cut__ in $S$ is a pair of [[subsets]] $L, U \subset S$ of $S$ that satisfy the following eight properties:

1.  $L$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]];
2.  Dually, $U$ is inhabited;
3.  If $x \lt y \in L$, then $x \in L$;
4.  Dually, if $x \gt y \in U$, then $x \in U$;
5.  If $x \in L$, then $x \lt y \in L$ for some $y$;
6.  Dually, $x \in U$, then $x \gt y \in U$ for some $y$;
7.  If $x \lt y$, then $x \in L$ or $y \in U$;
8.  If $x \in L$ and $y \in U$, then $x \lt y$.

###### Definition

The linearly ordered set $S$ is **Dedekind complete** if every cut $(L,U)$ is of the form
$$ L = \{x \;| \;x \lt a\},\; U = \{x \;|\; x \gt a\}$$
for some unique $a \in S$.

###### Definition

If $T$ is also an unbounded dense linear order, $S$ is Dedekind complete, and we have a [[universal arrow]] $u\colon T \to S$ in the [[category]] of linear orders, then $S$ (equipped with $u$) is [[the]] **Dedekind completion** of $T$.
=--

The set of Dedekind cuts of [[rational numbers]] --the set of [[real numbers]]-- is Dedekind complete. In fact, starting with any unbounded dense linearly ordered set $S$, the set of Dedekind cuts is isomorphic to the reals as long as $S$ is a [[countably infinite set]]. 

The operation of forming the set of Dedekind cuts is idempotent, so the Dedekind completion can be constructed as the set of Dedekind cuts.  More precisely, the Dedekind-complete linear orders form a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of dense unbounded linear orders, so that Dedekind completion is a kind of [[completion]] in the abstract categorial sense.


## Generalisations

One can generalise Dedekind completion from [[linear orders]] to [[quasiorders]].

A [[quasiordered set]] $S$ is __dense__ if, given finite (here always meaning [[Kuratowski-finite]]) subsets $F$ and $G$ such that $x \lt z$ whenever $x \in F$ and $z \in G$, we have some $y$ such that $x \lt y \lt z$ whenever $x \in F$ and $z \in G$.  Also, $S$ is __unbounded__ if, given any element $y$, there exist $x$ and $z$ such that $x \lt y \lt z$; that is, there are no [[maximal element|maximal]] or [[minimal element|minimal]] elements.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given an unbounded dense quasiordered set $S$, a __cut__ is a pair $(L,U)$ of [[subsets]] such that:

1.  $L$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]];
2.  Dually, $U$ is inhabited;
3.  If $x \lt y \in L$, then $x \in L$;
4.  Dually, if $x \gt y \in U$, then $x \in U$;
5.  If $F$ is a finite subset of $L$, then for some $x \in L$, every $y \in F$ satisfies $y \lt x$;
6.  Dually, if $F$ is a finite subset of $U$, then for some $x \in U$, every $y \in F$ satisfies $y \gt x$;
7.  If ...;
8.  If $x \in L$ and $y \in U$, then $x \lt y$.
=--

We then define Dedekind-complete quasiorders and Dedekind completions of quasiorders the same as for linear orders, using this notion of cut.

Sections 4.31--39 of _[[HAF]]_ do things in even more generality, but I don\'t really understand it.
