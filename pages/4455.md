## Idea

The _Dedekind completion_ of a [[linear order]] $L$ is a new linear order $\widebar{L}$ that contains [[suprema]] for all [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[bounded subsets]], and such that a supremum in $L$ is still a supremum in $\widebar{L}$. 

While Dedekind completeness was traditionally described in the context of the [[real numbers]], it can be stated for any [[linear order]], although it really works best for [[dense order|dense]] and unbounded (without [[top]] or [[bottom]]) linear orders. Intuitively, a linear order is _Dedekind complete_ if [[Dedekind cuts]] don't give any 'new' elements.


## Definitions

+-- {: .standout}
Any paragraph containing the string 'duiq' is original research (although lower duiqs at least are known in [[domain theory]]).
=--


Let $S$ be a [[set]] with a [[dense order|dense]] [[linear order]] $\lt$ without [[top]] or [[bottom]] elements.

###### Definition

A __cut__ in $S$ is a pair of [[subsets]] $L, U \subset S$ of $S$ that satisfy the following eight properties:

1.  $L$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]];
2.  Dually, $U$ is inhabited;
3.  If $x \lt y \in L$, then $x \in L$;
4.  Dually, if $x \gt y \in U$, then $x \in U$;
5.  If $x \in L$, then $x \lt y \in L$ for some $y$;
6.  Dually, $x \in U$, then $x \gt y \in U$ for some $y$;
7.  If $x \lt y$, then $x \in L$ or $y \in U$;
8.  If $x \in L$ and $y \in U$, then $x \lt y$.

###### Definition

The linearly ordered set $S$ is **Dedekind complete** if every cut $(L,U)$ is of the form
$$ L = \{x \;| \;x \lt a\},\; U = \{x \;|\; x \gt a\}$$
for some unique $a \in S$.

###### Definition

If $T$ is also an unbounded dense linear order, $S$ is Dedekind complete, and we have a [[universal arrow]] $u\colon T \to S$ in the [[category]] of linear orders, then $S$ (equipped with $u$) is [[the]] **Dedekind completion** of $T$.
=--

The set of Dedekind cuts of [[rational numbers]] --the set of [[real numbers]]-- is Dedekind complete. In fact, starting with any unbounded dense linearly ordered set $S$, the set of Dedekind cuts is isomorphic to the reals as long as $S$ is a [[countably infinite set]]. 

The operation of forming the set of Dedekind cuts is idempotent, so the Dedekind completion can be constructed as the set of Dedekind cuts.  More precisely, the Dedekind-complete linear orders form a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of dense unbounded linear orders, so that Dedekind completion is a kind of [[completion]] in the abstract categorial sense.


## Generalisations

One can generalise Dedekind completion from [[linear orders]] to [[quasiorders]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __duiq__ (**d**ense **u**nbounded **i**nhabited **q**uasiorder) is a [[quasiordered set]] $S$ such that, given finite (here always meaning [[Kuratowski-finite]]) [[subsets]] $F$ and $G$ of $S$ such that $x \lt z$ whenever $x \in F$ and $z \in G$, we have some $y$ in $S$ such that $x \lt y \lt z$ whenever $x \in F$ and $z \in G$.
=--

Note that, for $S$ a [[linear order]], $S$ is a duiq iff $S$ is dense, unbounded, and [[inhabited set|inhabited]], hence the term 'duiq'.  (Using linearity, we may assume that $F$ and $G$ are [[subsingletons]]; then two [[singleton subsets]] is denseness, one singleton subset and one [[empty subset]] is unboundedness, and two empty subsets is inhabitedness.)

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a duiq $S$, a __cut__ is a pair $(L,U)$ of [[subsets]] such that:

1.  $L$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]] (which is a special case of (5) for $F$ the [[empty subset]]);
2.  Dually, $U$ is inhabited (a special case of (6));
3.  If $x \lt y \in L$, then $x \in L$;
4.  Dually, if $x \gt y \in U$, then $x \in U$;
5.  If $F$ is a finite subset of $L$ (which we may assume inhabited if we include (1)), then for some $x \in L$, every $y \in F$ satisfies $y \lt x$;
6.  Dually, if $F$ is a finite (inhabited) subset of $U$, then for some $x \in U$, every $y \in F$ satisfies $y \gt x$;
7.  If $L \lt x \lt U$ and $L \lt y \lt U$, then $x = y$;
8.  If $x \in L$ and $y \in U$, then $x \lt y$.
=--

We then define __Dedekind-complete__ duiqs and __Dedekind completions__ of duiqs the same as for dense linear orders, using this notion of cut.

A good example of a duiq is the set of [[rational number|rational]]-valued [[functions]] on any [[set]] $X$; the Dedekind completion is the set of [[real number|real]]-valued functions on $X$.

Sections 4.31--39 of _[[HAF]]_ do things in even more generality, but I don\'t really understand it yet.


## One-sided Dedekind completions

At least in [[classical mathematics]], considering only $L$ (for a __lower cut__) or $U$ (for an __upper cut__) doesn\'t really give us anything new for linear orders; we have only the technicality that $\infty \coloneqq (S,\empty)$ or $-\infty \coloneqq (\empty,S)$ is a cut (depending on the side), and we can rule even these out by simply requiring that $L$ have an upper bound or that $U$ have a lower bound.

In [[constructive mathematics]], one-sided cuts are more general; see [[one-sided real number]] for a discussion of the case where $S$ is the linear order of [[rational numbers]].

Even in classical mathematics, one-sided cuts do give us something new for quasiorders.  Here, we have first more general one-sided notions of duiqs: a __lower duiq__ need only satisfy the condition of a duiq for $G$ a [[singleton]], and an __upper duiq__ need only satisfy the condition for $F$ a singleton.  Then the __lower Dedekind completion__ of a lower duiq is its set of lower cuts, and the __upper Dedekind completion__ of an upper duiq is its set of upper cuts.

For example, let $X$ be a [[compactum]] and let $S$ be the quasiordered set of [[continuous map|continuous]] real-valued functions on $X$.  Then $S$ is a duiq, hence both a lower and upper duiq.  Its lower Dedekind completion is the set of lower [[semicontinuous map|semicontinuous]] functions on $X$ taking values in the [[lower reals]] (which classically are all either real or $\infty$); and dually on the upper side.  Even working classically and ignoring the technicality of $\infty$, semicontinuous functions are much more general than continuous ones.
