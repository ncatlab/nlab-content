_Set_ is a name for the (or a) category with [[set|sets]] as objects and [[function|functions]] between sets as morphisms.

This category has many marvelous properties, which make it a common choice for serving as a '[[foundations|foundation]]' of mathematics.  For instance:

* It is a [[topos]], and in particular it is [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]].
* It is [[locally small category|locally small]]
* It is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], and therefore $\infty$-[[extensive category|extensive]] (as is any cocomplete topos).
* It is [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]]

At least assuming [[classical logic]], these properties suffice to characterize $Set$ uniquely up to equivalence among all categories.  Note, however, that the definitions of "locally small" and "(co)complete" presuppose a notion of _small_ and therefore a knowledge of what a _set_ is.

It is usually assumed that $Set$ satisfies the [[axiom of choice]] and has a [[natural numbers object]].  In Lawvere's theory [[ETCS]], which can serve as a foundation for much of mathematics, $Set$ is asserted to be a well-pointed topos that satisfies the axiom of choice and has a natural numbers object.  It follows that it is automatically "locally small" and "complete and cocomplete" relative to the notion of "smallness" defined in terms of itself (actually, this is true for any topos).

Conversely, $\Set$ in [[constructive mathematics]] cannot satisfy the axiom of choice (since this implies [[excluded middle]]), although constructivists might accept [[COSHEP]] (that $Set$ has [[projective object|enough projectives]]).  In [[predicative mathematics]], $\Set$ is not even a topos, although most predicativists would still agree that it is a [[pretopos]], and predicativists of the constructive school would even agree that it is a [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]] pretopos.

# Remarks #

* Above we considered $Set$ to be the category of _all_ sets, so that in particular $Set$ itself is a [[large category]].  Authors who assume a [[universe]] as part of their [[foundations]] often define $Set$ to be the category of *small* sets (those contained in the universe).
