

Given a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[Lorentzian manifold]] $\Sigma$, then for a pont $x \in \Sigma$ 

1. its _open [[future cone]]_ is the set of all points $y$ distinct from $x$ such that there is a [[future]]-directed [[time-like]] [[geodesic]] from $x$ to $y$;

1. its _closed future cone_ is the set of all points $y$ such that there is a [[future]]-directed [[time-like]] or [[light-like]] [[geodesic]] from $x$ to $y$;

1. its _open [[past cone]]_ is the set of all points $y$ distinct from $x$ such that there is a [[past]]-directed [[time-like]] [[geodesic]] from $x$ to $y$;

1. its _closed past cone_ is the set of all points $y$ such that there is a [[past]]-directed [[time-like]] or [[light-like]] [[geodesic]] from $x$ to $y$.

The [[boundary]] of the union of the past and future closed cone is the _[[light cone]]_ of the point.

Given a [[subset]] $S \subset X$, then its future/past open/closed cone is the union of that of all its points.
