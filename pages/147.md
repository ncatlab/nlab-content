## Idea 

A _site_ is a [[small category]] equipped with a [[coverage]] or [[Grothendieck topology]]. The [[category of sheaves]] is a [[sheaf topos]] and the site is a _site of definition_ for this topos.

## Definition 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A _site_ $(C,J)$ is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a [[coverage]] $J$.


=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Usually a site is required to be a [[small category]]. See [[large site]].

Every [[coverage]] induces a [[Grothendieck topology]]. Often sites are defined to be categories equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Some constructions and properties are more elegantly handled with covergaes, some with Grothendieck topologies.

Notice that there are many equivalent ways to define a [[Grothendieck topology]], for instance in terms of a system of [[local isomorphisms]], or in terms of a system of [[dense monomorphisms]] in the [[category of presheaves]] $PSh(S)$.

=--


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $(C,J)$ a site, we write $Sh_J(C)$ for the
[[category of sheaves]] on $C$ with respect to the [[coverage]] $J$.

=--

+-- {: .un_defn #MorphismOfSites}
###### Definition


A **morphism of sites** $f : (C,J) \to (D,K)$ is 

* a [[functor]] $f : C \to D$;

* such that 

  * $f$ _preserves covers_ in that for every [[covering]] $\{p_i : U_i \to U\}$ of an object $U \in C$ with respect to the coverage $J$, we have that $\{f(p_i) : f(U_i) \to f(U)\}$ is a covering of $f(U) \in D$ with respect to the covering $K$.

  * $f$ is a [[flat functor]];

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

If $C$ has [[finite limit]]s then the condition that $f : C \to D$ is a [[flat functor]] is equivalent to $f$ preserving these finite limits: to $f$ being a left [[exact functor]].

=--

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $f : (C,J) \to (D,K)$ be a [morphism of sites](#MorphismOfSites). 

Notice that precomposition with $f$ defines a [[functor]] between categories of presheaves $(-)\circ f : PSh(D) \to PSh(C)$.

There is a [[geometric morphism]] between the [[categories of sheaves]]

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) : Sh_K(D) \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}
    Sh_(J)(C)
$$

where $f_*$ is the restriction of $f$ to sheaves.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the assumption that $f$ preserves covers we have that the restriction of $(-)\circ f$ to $Sh_K(D)$ indeed factors through $Sh_C(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C)$.Also $(-)\circ f$ preserves all [[limit]]s, because for presheaves these are computed objectwise. And since the inclusion $Sh_K(D) \to PSh(D)$ is [[right adjoint]] (to [[sheafification]]) we have that 

$$
  f_* : Sh_K(D) \hookrightarrow PSh(D) \stackrel{(-)\circ f}{\to} Sh_J(C)
$$ 

preserves all limits. Therefore by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] it has a [[left adjoint]]. Explicitly, this is the composite of the left adjoints to $(-)\circ f$ and to sheaf inclusion. The first is left [[Kan extension]] $Lan_f$ along $f$ and the second is [[sheafification]] $L_J$ on $(C,J)$, so the left adjoint is the composite

$$
  f^*  :Sh_J(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C) \stackrel{Lan_f}{\to}S
   PSh(D) \stackrel{L_J}{\to} Sh_J(D)
  \,.
$$

Here the first morphism preserves all limits, the last one all finite limits. Hence the composite preserves all finite limits if the left [[Kan extension]] $Lan_f$ does. This is the case if $f$ is a [[flat functor]].

(Because the left [[Kan extension]] is given by the [[colimit]] 
$Lan_f X : d \mapsto {\lim_{\to}}((f^{op}/d) \to C^{op} \stackrel{X}{\to})$ over the [[comma category]] $f^{op}/d$ which is a [[filtered category]] by definition if $f$ is flat, and [[filtered colimit]]s are precisely those that commute with [[finite limit]]s ).

## Examples



### Classes of sites

* Every [[frame]] is canonically a site, where $U$ is covered by $\{U_i\}$ precisely if it is their [[join]].
  
  An subclass of examples is the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]].

This are examples of [[posite]]s/[[(0,1)-site]].

Other classes of sites are listed in the following.

* [[big site]] 

* [[dense sub-site]]

* [[large site]], [[essentially small site]]

* [[concrete site]]

* [[locally connected site]] / [[locally ∞-connected site]]

  * [[connected site]] / [[∞-connected site]]

  * [[strongly connected site]] / [[strongly ∞-connected site]]

  * [[totally connected site]] / [[totally ∞-connected site]]

* [[local site]] / [[∞-local site]]

* [[cohesive site]], [[∞-cohesive site]]


### Morphisms of sites


+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

If $A$ and $B$ are [[frame]]s regarded as sites via their canonical coverages, then a morphism of sites $A \to B$ is equivalently a frame [[homomorphism]], a function preserving finite [[meet]]s and arbitrary [[join]]s.

=--


+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example
**(sub-sites)**

For $X$ a presite and $U \in S_X$ an object in the corresponding category, the [[comma category]] $(Y_{S_X} / U)$ is naturally regarded as the presite defined by $U$, which by convenient abuse of notation one would just write $U$ itself, so that $S_U = S_X \downarrow U$. 

For instance for $X$ a topological space and $U \in Op(X)$ an open subset, $U$ regarded as a topological space in its own right has corresponding to it the site $U$ with $S_U = Op(U) = Op(X) \downarrow U$.

The [[stuff, structure, property|forgetful]] [[functor]]
$$
  j^t_{U \to X} : (S_U = (Y_{S_X} / U)) \to S_X
$$
therefore constitutes a canonical morphism of pre-sites
$$
  j_{U \to X} : X \to U  
  \,.
$$

This induces a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the site $U$ whose [[local epimorphisms]] $(Y \to U) \in [S_U^{op}, Set]$ are precisely those morphisms for which
$$
  \hat j^t_{U \to X}(Y \to U)
  \in 
  [S_X^{op}, Set]
$$
is a [[local epimorphism]].

This is also called the [[big site]] of $U$

There are natural operations for [[restriction and extension of sheaves]] from a sub-site $U$ to $X$ and back.

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

For $C$ and $D$ [[regular category|regular categories]] equipped with their [[regular coverage]]s, a morphism of sites is the same as a [[regular functor]], i.e. a functor preserving finite limits and covers.


=--

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

For $C$ any site with finite limits, there is canonically a  morphism of sites to its [[tangent category]]. See there for details.

### Specific sites

* For every site there is the corresponding [[double negation topology]] that forces the sheaf topos to a [[Boolean topos]].

* The sites that define the [[higher geometry|geometry]] called [[differential geometry]] are [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$, [[Diff]], etc, equipped with the [[open cover]] [[coverage]].

* The sites that induce [[topology]topological geometry]] are small versions of [[Top]] equipped with the [[open cover]] [[coverage]].

  * The sites that induce the [[higher geometry]] modeled on [[Euclidean topology]] are the large site of [[paracompact manifold]]s and its [[dense sub-site]] [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$.

* The sites that define the [[higher geometry|geometry]] called [[algebraic geometry]] are site structures on categories of formal duals of [[commutative ring]]s or commutative [[associative algebra]]s

  * [[fppf site]], [[fpqc site]], [[etale site]], etc.
