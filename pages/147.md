## Idea 

A _site_  is a [[locally presentable category|presentation]] of a [[sheaf topos]] as a structure [[free cocompletion|freely generated under colimits]] from a category, subject to the relation that certain [[covering]] colimits are preserved.

As such, sites generalise [[topological spaces]] and [[locales]], which present [[localic topos|localic]] sheaf toposes.  More precisely, sites generalise and [[categorify]] [[posites]], which present localic toposes but also present locales themselves in a decategorified manner.

In technical terms, a _site_ is a [[small category]] equipped with a [[coverage]] or [[Grothendieck topology]]. The [[category of sheaves]] over a site is a [[sheaf topos]] and the site is a _site of definition_ for this topos.


## Definition 

+-- {: .num_defn #Site}
###### Definition

A _site_ $(C,J)$ is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a [[coverage]] $J$.

For $\mathcal{E}$ a topos equipped with an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  \mathcal{E} \simeq Sh(C,J)
$$

to the [[sheaf topos]] over a site, one says that $(C,J)$ is a **site of definition** for $\mathcal{E}$.

=--

Some classes of sites have their special names

+-- {: .num_defn #TypesOfSites}
###### Definition

A site is called

* a [[small site]], [[large site]], _essentially small site_ if the underlying category is a [[small category]], [[large category]], [[essentially small category]], respectively;

* a **[[cartesian site]]** if the underlying category is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]] (which the [[Elephant]] calls a [[cartesian category]]);

* a **[[standard site]]** if it is a cartesian site equipped with a [[subcanonical coverage]].

=--

The term [[standard site]] appears in ([Johnstone, example A2.1.11](#Johnstone)).


+-- {: .num_remark #SmallAndLarge}
###### Remark

Often a site is required to be a [[small category]]. But also [[large site]]s play a role.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #CoveragesAndTopologies}
###### Remark

Every [[coverage]] induces a [[Grothendieck topology]]. Often sites are defined to be categories equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Some constructions and properties are more elegantly handled with covergaes, some with Grothendieck topologies.

Notice that there are many equivalent ways to define a [[Grothendieck topology]], for instance in terms of a system of [[local isomorphisms]], or in terms of a system of [[dense monomorphisms]] in the [[category of presheaves]] $PSh(S)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $(C,J)$ a site, we write $Sh_J(C)$ for the
[[category of sheaves]] on $C$ with respect to the [[coverage]] $J$.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #MorphismOfSites}
###### Definition

A **morphism of sites** $f : (C,J) \to (D,K)$ is 

* a [[functor]] $f : C \to D$;

* such that 

  1, $f$ is a [[representably flat functor]];

  1. $f$ _preserves [[cover]]s_ 

     in that for every [[covering]] $\{p_i : U_i \to U\}$ of an object $U \in C$ with respect to the coverage $J$, we have that $\{f(p_i) : f(U_i) \to f(U)\}$ is a covering of $f(U) \in D$ with respect to the covering $K$.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $C$ has [[finite limit]]s then the condition that $f : C \to D$ is a [[flat functor]] is equivalent to $f$ preserving these finite limits: to $f$ being a left [[exact functor]].

=--



## Properties


### Subcanonical sites

+-- {: .num_prop #CharacterizationOfSubcanonicalSites}
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{E}$ a [[sheaf topos]], the [[essentially small category|essentially small]] sites of definition $(\mathcal{C}, J)$ of $\mathcal{E}$ such that $J$ is a [[subcanonical coverage]] are precisely the [[full subcategories]] on [[generating families]] of objects equipped with the coverages induced from the [[canonical coverage]] of $\mathcal{E}$.

=--

This appears as ([Johnstone, prop. C2.2.16](#Johnstone)).




### Morphisms of sites and geometric morphisms
 {#MorphismsOfSitesAndGeometricMorphisms}

We discuss how morphisms of sites, def. \ref{MorphismOfSites}, induce [[geometric morphism]]s of the corresponding [[sheaf topos]]es, and how the converse holds, too, under certain conditions. The reader might want to first have a look at the discussion of <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/geometric+morphism#BetweenPresheafToposes">Geometric morphisms between presheaf toposes</a>.

+-- {: .num_prop #MorphismsOfSitesInduceGeometricMorphisms}
###### Proposition

Let $f : (\mathcal{C},J) \to (\mathcal{D},K)$ be a [morphism of sites](#MorphismOfSites). 

Notice that precomposition with $f$ defines a [[functor]] between categories of presheaves $(-)\circ f : PSh(\mathcal{D}) \to PSh(\mathcal{C})$.

There is a [[geometric morphism]] between the [[categories of sheaves]]

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) : Sh(\mathcal{D},K) \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}
    Sh(\mathcal{C},J)
$$

where $f_*$ is the restriction of $f$ to sheaves.

=--

This appears for instance as ([Johnstone, lemma C2.2.3, cor. C2.2.4](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the assumption that $f$ preserves covers we have that the restriction of $(-)\circ f$ to $Sh_K(\mathcal{D})$ indeed factors through $Sh(\mathcal{C}) \hookrightarrow PSh(\mathcal{C})$. 

Because for $\{U_i \to U\}$ a [[cover]] in $\mathcal{C}$ and $F$ a [[sheaf]] on $\mathcal{D}$, we have that (assuming here for simplicity that $\mathcal{C}$ has finite limits)

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    PSh_{\mathcal{C}}( \lim_\to ( \coprod_{i, j} U_i \prod_{U} U_j)
    \stackrel{\to}{\to}
      \coprod_{i} U_i )
    \;,\;
    F(f(-))
    )
    & \simeq 
    \lim_{\leftarrow}
     \left(
      \prod_{i,j} PSh_{\mathcal{C}}( U_i \prod_U U_j, F(f(-)))
       \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}
       \prod_i PSh_C(U_i , F(f(-)))
     \right)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \lim_{\leftarrow}
     \left(
      \prod_{i,j} F(f(U_i \prod_U U_j)))
       \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}
       \prod_i F(f(U_i))
     \right)   
    \\
    & \simeq
    \lim_{\leftarrow}
     \left(
      \prod_{i,j} F(f(U_i) \prod_{f(U)} f(U_j))))
       \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}
       \prod_i F(f(U_i))
     \right)       
    \\
    & \simeq
    PSh_{\mathcal{D}}( \lim_\to ( \coprod_{i, j} f(U_i) \prod_{f(U)} f(U_j))
    \stackrel{\to}{\to}
      \coprod_{i} f(U_i) )
    \;,\;
    F
   )         
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used the [[Yoneda lemma]], the fact that the [[hom functor]] $PSh(-,-)$ sends [[colimit]]s in the first argument to [[limit]]s, and the assumption that $f$ preserves the [[pullback]]s involved.

Also $(-)\circ f$ preserves all [[limit]]s, because for presheaves these are computed objectwise. And since the inclusion $Sh_K(\mathcal{D}) \to PSh(\mathcal{D})$ is [[right adjoint]] (to [[sheafification]]) we have that 

$$
  f_* : Sh_K(\mathcal{D}) \hookrightarrow PSh(\mathcal{D}) \stackrel{(-)\circ f}{\to} Sh_J(\mathcal{C})
$$ 

preserves all limits. Therefore by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] it has a [[left adjoint]]. Explicitly, this is the composite of the left adjoint to $(-)\circ f$ and to sheaf inclusion. The first is left [[Kan extension]] $Lan_f$ along $f$ and the second is [[sheafification]] $L_J$ on $(\mathcal{C},J)$, so the left adjoint is the composite

$$
  f^*  :Sh_J(\mathcal{C}) \hookrightarrow PSh(\mathcal{C}) \stackrel{Lan_f}{\to}S
   PSh(\mathcal{D}) \stackrel{L_J}{\to} Sh_J(\mathcal{D})
  \,.
$$

Here the first morphism preserves all limits, the last one all finite limits. Hence the composite preserves all finite limits if the left [[Kan extension]] $Lan_f$ does. This is the case if $f$ is a [[flat functor]].

(Because the left [[Kan extension]] is given by the [[colimit]] 
$Lan_f X : d \mapsto {\lim_{\to}}((f^{op}/d) \to {\mathcal{C}}^{op} \stackrel{X}{\to} Set)$ over the [[comma category]] $f^{op}/d$ which is a [[filtered category]] if $f$ is flat, and [[filtered colimit]]s are precisely those that commute with [[finite limit]]s. For more details on this argument see the discussion at <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/geometric+morphism#BetweenPresheafToposes">Geometric morphisms between presheaf toposes</a>.)

+-- {: .num_prop #GeometricMorphismsOverCartesianSitesComesFromMorphismsOfSites}
###### Proposition

Let $(\mathcal{C}, J)$ and $(\mathcal{D}, K)$ be [[cartesian site]]s such that 

* $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[small category]], 

* $\mathcal{D}$ is a possibly [[large site]] but with a [[small category|small]] [[dense subsite]]  (an "essentially small site" in ([Johnstone, p. 548](#Johnstone)))

* and the [[coverage]] $K$ is [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]]. 

Then a [[geometric morphism]] of the corresponding [[sheaf toposes]]

$$
  f : Sh(\mathcal{D}, K) \to Sh(\mathcal{C}, J)
$$

is induced by a morphism of sites, def. \ref{MorphismOfSites},

$$
  (\mathcal{D}, K) \leftarrow (\mathcal{C}, J)  : F
$$

precisely if the [[inverse image]] of $f$ respects the [[Yoneda embedding]]s $j$ as

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D } &\stackrel{F}{\leftarrow}& \mathcal{C}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{j_{\mathcal{D}}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j_{\mathcal{C}}}}
    \\
    Sh(\mathcal{D}, K) &\stackrel{f^*}{\leftarrow}&
    Sh(\mathcal{C}, J)    
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as ([Johnstone, lemma C2.3.8](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It suffices to show that given $f$, the factorization $F$ is, if it exists, necessarily a morphism of sites: because since $f^*$ is [[left adjoint]] and thus preserves all [[colimit]]s and every object in $Sh(C)$ is a colimit of [[representable functor|representables]], $f^*$ is fixed by the factorization. By uniqueness of [[adjoint functor]]s this means then that together with its [[right adjoint]] it is the geometric morphism induced from the morphism of sites, by prop. \ref{MorphismsOfSitesInduceGeometricMorphisms}.

So we show that $F$ is necessarily a morphisms of sites: 

1. since the [[Yoneda embedding]] and [[sheafification]] as well as [[inverse image]]s preserve finite limits, so does $f^* j_{\mathcal{C}}$ and hence $F$ preserves finite limits, hence is a [[flat functor]];

1. $f^* h_{\mathcal{C}}$ preserves [[covering]]s (maps them to [[epimorphism]]s in $Sh(D, K)$) and since $K$ is assumed to be subcanonical it follows from prop. \ref{CharacterizationOfSubcanonicalSites} that $j_{\mathcal{D}}$ also reflects covers. Therefore $F$ preserves covers.

###### Corollary

Let $(\mathcal{C},J)$ be a [[small category|small]] [[cartesian site]] and let $\mathcal{E}$ be any [[sheaf topos]]. Then we have an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Topos(\mathcal{E}, Sh(\mathcal{C}, J))
  \simeq
  Site((\mathcal{C}, J), \mathcal{E})
$$

between the [[geometric morphism]]s from $\mathcal{E}$ to $Sh(\mathcal{C}, J)$ and the morphisms of [[site]]s from $(\mathcal{C}, J)$ to the [[big site]] $(\mathcal{E}, C)$ for $C$ the [[canonical coverage]] on $\mathcal{E}$.

This appears as ([Johnstone, cor. C2.3.9](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since for the [[canonical coverage]] the [[Yoneda embedding]] is the [[identity]], this follows directly from prop. \ref{GeometricMorphismsOverCartesianSitesComesFromMorphismsOfSites}.

## Examples


### Classes of sites

* Every [[frame]] is canonically a site, where $U$ is covered by $\{U_i\}$ precisely if it is their [[join]].
  
  A subclass of examples is the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]].

  This are examples of [[posite]]s/[[(0,1)-site]].

* Various categories come with canonical structures of sites on them:

  * For every category $C$ there is its [[canonical coverage]].

  * On every [[regular category]] there is its [[regular coverage]].

  * On every [[coherent category]] there is its [[coherent coverage]].

  If the category in question is the [[syntactic category]] of a [[theory]], the corresponding site is the [[syntactic site]].

* For every site there is the corresponding [[double negation topology]] that forces the sheaf topos to a [[Boolean topos]].

Other classes of sites are listed in the following.

* [[big site]] 

* [[dense sub-site]]

* [[large site]], [[essentially small site]]

* [[concrete site]]

* [[locally connected site]] / [[locally ∞-connected site]]

  * [[connected site]] / [[∞-connected site]]

  * [[strongly connected site]] / [[strongly ∞-connected site]]

  * [[totally connected site]] / [[totally ∞-connected site]]

* [[local site]] / [[∞-local site]]

* [[cohesive site]], [[∞-cohesive site]]


### Specific sites

* Sites for [[big topos]]es defining notions of [[higher geometry|geometry]] are:

  * The sites that define the [[higher geometry|geometry]] called [[differential geometry]] are [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$, [[SmoothMfd]], etc, equipped with the [[open cover]] [[coverage]]. Or more generally [[smooth loci]] etc.

  * The sites that induce [[topology]topological geometry]] are small versions of [[Top]] equipped with the [[open cover]] [[coverage]].

  * The sites that induce the [[higher geometry]] modeled on [[Euclidean topology]] are the large site of [[paracompact manifold]]s and its [[dense sub-site]] [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$.

* The sites that define the [[higher geometry|geometry]] called [[algebraic geometry]] are site structures on categories of formal duals of [[commutative ring]]s or commutative [[associative algebra]]s

  * [[fppf site]], [[fpqc site]], [[etale site]], [[Zariski site]] [[crystalline site]], 
    etc.



### Morphisms of sites


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

If $A$ and $B$ are [[frame]]s regarded as sites via their canonical coverages, then a morphism of sites $A \to B$ is equivalently a frame [[homomorphism]], a function preserving finite [[meet]]s and arbitrary [[join]]s.

=--


+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example
**(sub-sites)**

For $X$ a presite and $U \in S_X$ an object in the corresponding category, the [[comma category]] $(Y_{S_X} / U)$ is naturally regarded as the presite defined by $U$, which by convenient abuse of notation one would just write $U$ itself, so that $S_U = S_X \downarrow U$. 

For instance for $X$ a topological space and $U \in Op(X)$ an open subset, $U$ regarded as a topological space in its own right has corresponding to it the site $U$ with $S_U = Op(U) = Op(X) \downarrow U$.

The [[stuff, structure, property|forgetful]] [[functor]]
$$
  j^t_{U \to X} : (S_U = (Y_{S_X} / U)) \to S_X
$$
therefore constitutes a canonical morphism of pre-sites
$$
  j_{U \to X} : X \to U  
  \,.
$$

This induces a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the site $U$ whose [[local epimorphisms]] $(Y \to U) \in [S_U^{op}, Set]$ are precisely those morphisms for which
$$
  \hat j^t_{U \to X}(Y \to U)
  \in 
  [S_X^{op}, Set]
$$
is a [[local epimorphism]].

This is also called the [[big site]] of $U$

There are natural operations for [[restriction and extension of sheaves]] from a sub-site $U$ to $X$ and back.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $C$ and $D$ [[regular category|regular categories]] equipped with their [[regular coverage]]s, a morphism of sites is the same as a [[regular functor]], i.e. a functor preserving finite limits and covers.


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $C$ any site with finite limits, there is canonically a  morphism of sites to its [[tangent category]]. See there for details.
