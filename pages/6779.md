## Idea

The first nonzero [[homotopy group]] and [[homology group]] of a [[simply-connected
topological space]] occur in the same dimension and are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]].

## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If a [[topological space]] (or [[infinity-groupoid]]) $X$ is [[n-connected object in an (infinity,1)-topos|(n-1)-connected]] for $n \geq 2$ then the canonical morphism 

$$
  \pi_n(X) \to H_n(X)
$$

from the [[homotopy group]] to the [[homology group]] in degree $n$ is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Remark

With the [[universal coefficient theorem]] a corresponding statement follows for the [[cohomology group]] $H^n(X,A)$.
