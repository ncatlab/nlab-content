##Idea

[[chain complex|Chain complexes]] are most often encountered in an Abelian context, but the definition makes sense even when the [[group]]s involved need not be [[abelian group|abelian]]. What does not work well is the formation of the [[homology]] of such a chain complex of groups, except if it is 'normal' in the following sense:

##Definition

A _chain complex_ of groups is a sequence (of any length, finite or infinite) of groups and homomorphisms, for instance,

$$\ldots \to C_n \stackrel{\partial_n}{\longrightarrow} C_{n-1} \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\longrightarrow}C_{n-2}\longrightarrow \ldots ,$$
 
in which each composite $\partial_{n-1} \circ \partial_n $ is the trivial homomorphism.

The chain complex is __normal__ if each image $\partial_n C_n$ is a [[normal subgroup]] of the next group $C_{n-1}$.

##Example

If $G$ is a [[simplicial group]] then its [[Moore complex]] is a normal complex of groups.

##Remark

There is an obvious generalisation to normal complex of groupoids, provided one keeps to working with groupoids all having the same set of objects and morphisms which are the identity on objects.  

Likewise, one can talk about normal complexes in a [[semi-abelian category]].
