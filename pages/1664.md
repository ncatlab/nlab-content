##Idea

Chain complexes are most often encountered in an Abelian context, but the definition makes sense even when the groups involved need not be Abelian. What does not work well is the formation of the homology of such a chain complex of groups, except if it is 'normal' in the following sense:

##Definition

A _chain complex_ of groups is a sequence (of any length, finite or infinite) of groups and homomorphisms, for instance,

$$\ldots \to C_n \stackrel{\partial_n}{\longrightarrow} C_{n-1} \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\longrightarrow}C_{n-2}\longrightarrow \ldots ,$$
 
in which each composite $\partial_{n-1}\partial_n $ is the trivial homomorphism.

The chain complex is **normal** is each image $\partial_n C_n$ is a normal subgroup of the next group.
