## Definition (orientaton on a manifold)#

### In terms of lifting through Whitehead tower# #

One way to encode an _orientation_ on a [[manifold]] $X$ is as a lift $\hat g$ of the classifying map $g : X \to \mathcal{B}O(n)$ of its [[tangent bundle]] through the fist step $S O(n) \to O(n)$ in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $X$:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathcal{B}S O(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathcal{B} O(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

From this perspective a choice of orientation is the first in a series of special structures on $X$ that continue with

* [[Spin structure]]

* [[String structure]]

* [[Fivebrane structure]]
