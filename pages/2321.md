###### Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] and $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $k$, an **orientation** on $V$ is an [[equivalence class]] of trivializations of the real [[line bundle]] $\wedge^k V$ that is obtained by associating to each [[fiber]] of $V$ its skew-symmetric $k$th [[tensor power]].

Equivalently for a [[smooth manifold]] this is an equivalence class of an everywhere non-vanishing element of $\wedge^k_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(V)$.

An orientation of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ or [[cotangent bundle]] $T^* X$ is called an **orientation of the manifold**. This is equivalently a choice of no-where vanishing [[differential form]] on $X$ of degree the [[dimension]] of $X$.

If a trivialization of $\wedge^k V$ exists, $V$ is called **orientable**.

For $\omega$ an orientation, $-\omega$ is the **opposite orientation**.

## Properties

### In terms of lifting through Whitehead tower 

An orientation on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ is equivalently a lift $\hat g$ of the classifying map $g : X \to \mathcal{B}O(n)$ of its [[tangent bundle]] through the fist step $S O(n) \to O(n)$ in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $X$:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathcal{B}S O(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathcal{B} O(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

From this perspective a choice of orientation is the first in a series of special structures on $X$ that continue with

* **orientation**

* [[spin structure]]

* [[string structure]], [[differential string structure]]

* [[fivebrane structure]], [[differential fivebrane structure]]

### In terms of orientation in generalized cohomology


For $E$ an [[E-âˆž ring]] spectrum, tthere is a general notion of $R$-orientation of vector bundles. This is described at

* [[orientation in generalized cohomology]].

For $R = H(\mathbb{R})$ be the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]
for the [[discrete group|discrete]] [[abelian group]] $\mathbb{R}$
of [[real number]]s, orientation in $R$-cohomology is equivalent to the 
ordinary notion of orientation described above.
