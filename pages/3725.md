This PhD thesis is about a special case of the notion of [[Whitehead tower in an (∞,1)-topos]] in the context of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[topological ∞-groupoid]]s. Notably it introduces the notion of a **2-covering space** of a [[topological space]] as a certain topological groupoid over that space.

An exposition of central ideas can be found in the slides
