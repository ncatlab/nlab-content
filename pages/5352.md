
For $f : \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^l$ a [[differentiable]] [[function]], between [[Cartesian space]]s, its **Jacobian** [[matrix]] is the $(r \times s)$ matrix


$$
  J(f) \in Mat_{r \times s}(C^0(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}))
$$

of [[partial derivative]]s

$$
  J(f)_{i j} := \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} 
$$

Its [[determinant]] $det(J(f))$ is often called _the Jacobian of $f$_  .
