## Idea

What is called _picture number_ in [[string theory]] is a certain [[graded object|grading]] originally seen in the [[quantization]] of the [[NSR superstring]] ([Friedan-Martinec-Shenker 86](#FriedanMartinecShenker86)).

The [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] meaning was clarified in [Belopolsky 97b](#Belopolsky97b) in terms of an extra grading on [[differential forms on supermanifolds]] induced from a choice of _integral top-form_ needed for a notion of [[integration over supermanifolds]], see [Catenacci-Grassi-Noja 18](#CatenacciGrassiNoja18)
