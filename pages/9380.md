## Idea

The [[differential 2-form]]-data in a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] is sometimes called the "curving" of the connection data.

This terminology results from thinking of the [[circle 2-bundle]] equivalently as a [[bundle gerbe]] given by a transition-[[circle bundle]] on a suitable [[Cech groupoid]]. From this perspective the [[differential 1-form]] is an ordinary [[connection on a bundle]] for the transition bundles, and the 2-form data looks a bit like a variant of the _[[curvature]]_ of these bundles, which not exactly being this curvature. Hence "curving".

But of course the [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] has its own [[curvature]] [[differential 3-form]]. At least as soon as one passes to [[circle n-bundles with connection]] for arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the term "curving" becomes inappropriate.

## Properties

### $(\mathbf{B}U(1))$-principal 2-connections without curving

Circle 2-bundles "with connection but without curving" have as [[moduli infinity-stack|moduli 2-stack]] the [[delooping]] 

$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}) \in$ [[SmoothâˆžGrpd]] 

of the [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}$ or [[circle bundles with connection]].

The [[higher Atiyah groupoid]] of such a "pseudo-2-connection" $\nabla_1 \colon X \to \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn})$ is the corresponding [[higher Courant groupoid]] which [[Lie integration|Lie integrates]] the corresponding [[standard Courant Lie 2-algebroid]]. (See at _[[higher Atiyah groupoid]]_ for details.)
