## Idea

Where a [[vector]] specifies a _direction_ and a _magnitude_ , a _bivector_ specifies a _plane_ and a magnitude.

## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]], a _bivector_ in $V$ is an element $b \in \wedge^2 V$ of the second [[exterior power]]  of $V$.

This is canonically identified with an element of degree 2 in the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet V$.

If $V$ is equipped with a non-degenerate [[inner product]] then the space of bivectors is also canonically identified with a subspace of the [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V)$.
