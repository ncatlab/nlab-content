## Idea

Where a [[vector]] specifies a _direction_ and a _magnitude_ , a _bivector_ specifies a _plane_ and a magnitude.

## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]], a _bivector_ in $V$ is an element $b \in \wedge^2 V$ of the second [[exterior power]]  of $V$.

This is canonically identified with an element of degree 2 in the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet V$.

## Properties

### Clifford algebra and rotations

If $V$ is equipped with a non-degenerate [[inner product]] then the space of bivectors is also canonically identified with a subspace of the [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V)$.

If we write $\gamma_v \in Cl(V)$ for the CLifford algebra element corresponding to a vector $v \in V$, then this identification is given by the map

$$
  v \wedge w \mapsto 
  \frac{1}{2}\left(\gamma_{v} \cdot \gamma_w - \gamma_w \cdot \gamma_v\right)
  \,.
$$

(The [[inverse]] of this map is called the [[symbol map]].)

Under the [[commutator]] in the Clifford algebra bivectors go to bivectors and hence form a [[Lie algebra]]. This Lie algebra is the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ of $V$.



## References

Discussion of [[Clifford algebra]] and [[exterior algebra]] that amplifies the role of bivectors is notably in the references at _[[Geometric Algebra]]_ .
