## Idea

By _rational cohomology_ one usually means [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[rational number]] [[coefficients]], denoted $H^\bullet\big(-, \mathbb{Q}\big)$.

Hence, with the pertinent conditions on the [[domain]] [[space]] $X$ satisfied, its rational cohomology $H^\bullet\big(-, \mathbb{Q}\big)$ is what is computed by the [[Cech cohomology]] or [[singular cohomology]] or [[sheaf cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$.

###### Example
**([[universal coefficient theorem]] in [[rational cohomology]])**

For [[rational numbers]]-[[coefficients]] $\mathbb{Q}$, the
[[Ext groups]] $Ext^1(-;\mathbb{Q})$ vanish, and hence the [[universal coefficient theorem]] identifies [[rational cohomology]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] with the [[dual vector space]] of the [[rational vector space]] of rational [[homology groups]]:

$$
  H^\bullet
  \big(
    -; \, \mathbb{Q}
  \big)
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}
  \Big(
    H_\bullet\big(-;\,\mathbb{Q} \big);
    \,
    \mathbb{Q}
  \Big)
  \,.
$$
