## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $C$ a [[monoidal category]], the **category of [[monoid]]s** $Mon(C)$  in the $C$ is the [[category]] whose

* [[object]]s are [[monoid]]s in $C$;

* [[morphism]]s are morphisms in $C$ of the underlying objects that respect the monoid structure.

If $Assoc$ denotes the [[associative operad]] in $C$, then $Mon(C) = Alg_C Assoc$ is the category of [[algebras over an operad]] for $Assoc$.


## Properties

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation


Any category of monoids comes with a [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  U : Mon(C) \to C
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[monoidal category]] with [[coproduct]]s. Then the forgetful functor $U$ has a [[left adjoint]] $F_C : C \to Mon(C)$. On an object $X \in C$ the underlying object of $F_C X$ is

$$
  U_C F_C X 
  = 
  \coprod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X^{\otimes n}
  = 
  I_C \coprod X \coprod (X \otimes X) \coprod \cdots
$$

in $C$, with the monoidal structure given by tensor product/juxtaposition.


=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

A morphism $f : F_C X \to A$ in $Mon(C)$ with components $f_k : X^{\otimes k} \to U_C A$ is entirely fixed by its component $\tilde f = f_1 : X \to U_C A$ on $X$, because by the homomorphism property and the special free nature of the product in $F_C X$

$$
  \array{
    X^{\times k} \otimes X^{\otimes (n-k)} &\stackrel{f_k \otimes f_{n-k}}{\to}&
    A \otimes A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_A}}
    \\
    X^{\otimes n} &\stackrel{f_{n}}{\to}& A
  }
$$

it follows that 

$$
  f_n :
  X^{\otimes n} \stackrel{f_1^{\otimes n}}{\to} A^{\otimes n} \stackrel{\mu_A}{\to} A
  \,.
$$

Conversely, every choice for $f_1$ extends to a morphism $f$ in $Mon(C)$ this way.

###### Remark/Example

Free algebras of the form $F(A)$ are called **[[tensor algebra]]**s, at lest for $C = $ [[Vect]] and similar.

+-- {: .un_prop #PushOutOfMonoidsAlongFreeMorphisms}
###### Proposition

For $C$ a category with [[colimit]]s the category $Mon(C)$ of monoids has all [[pushout]]s 

$$
  \array{
    F(K) &\stackrel{F(f)}{\to}& F(L)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& P
  }
$$

along morphisms $F(f) : F(K) \to F(L)$ for $f : K \to L$ a morphism in $C$ and $F : C \to Mon(C)$ the free monoid functor from above.

Moreover, these pushouts in $Mon(C)$ are computed in $C$ as the [[colimit]] over a sequence

$$
  P \simeq \lim_{\to}( X := P_0 \to P_1 \to P_2 \to \cdots )
$$

of objects $(P_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, which are each given by pushouts in $C$ inductively as follows. 

Assume $P_{n-1}$ has been defined. Write $Sub(\mathbf{n})$ for the [[poset]] of [[subset]]s of the $n$-element set $\mathbf{n}$ (this is the poset of paths along the edges of an $n$-dimensional cube). Define a [[diagram]]

$$
  K : Sub \mathbf{n} \to C
$$

by setting on subsets $S \subset \mathbf{n}$

$$
  K_S := X \otimes V_1 \otimes X \otimes V_2 \otimes  \cdots \otimes V_n \otimes X
$$

where

$$
  V_i := \left\{
     \array{
        K & if not i \in S
        \\
        L & if i \in S
     }
  \right.
$$

and by assigning to a morphism $S_1 \subset S_2$ the morphism which is the [[tensor product]] of identities on $X$, identities on $L$ and the given morphism $f : K \to L$.

Write $K^-$ for the same diagram minus the terminal object $S = \mathbf{n}$. 

Now take $P_n$ to be the [[pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    \lim_{\to} K^- &\to& K \mathbf{n}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P_{n-1} &\to& P_n
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top morphism is the canonical one induced by the commutativity of the diagram $K$, and where the left morphism is defined in terms of components $K^-(S)$ of the colimit for $S \subset \mathbf{n}$ a proper subset by the tensor product morphisms of the form 

$$
  (\cdots X \otimes K \otimes \cdots \otimes L \otimes \cdots)
  \stackrel{\cdots \otimes \mu_X \circ (Id \otimes p) \otimes \cdots \otimes Id_L \otimes \cdots}{\to}  
  (X \otimes L)^{|S|} \otimes X
  \to P_{|S|} \to P_{n-1}
  \,.
$$

This gives the underlying object of the monoid $P$. Take the monoid structure on it as follows. The unit of $P$ is the composite

$$
 e_P : I_C \stackrel{e_X}{\to} X \to P
$$

with the unit of $X$. The product we take to be the image in the colimit of compatible morphisms $P_k \otimes P_k \to P_{k + l}$ defined by induction on $lk + l$ as follows. we observe that we have a pushout diagram

$$
  \array{
     Q_k \otimes (X \otimes L)^{\otimes l}
    \coprod_{Q_k \otimes Q_l}
    (X \otimes L)^{\otimes l} \otimes X \otimes Q_l
    &\to&
    (X \otimes L)^{\otimes k} \otimes X \otimes (X \otimes L)^{\otimes l} \otimes X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P_{k-1} \otimes P_l \coprod_{P_{k-1} \otimes P_{l-1}}
    P_k \otimes P_{l-1}
    &\to&
    P_k \otimes P_l
  }
  \,,
$$

where $Q_n := (\lim_{\to} K)_n$ is the colimit as in the above at stage $n$.

There is a morphism from the bottom left object to $P_{k+l}$ given by the induction assumption. Moreover we have a morphism from the top right object to $P_{k+1}$ obtained by first multiplying the two adjacent factors of $X$ and then applying the morphism $(X \otimes L)^{\otimes k+l} \otimes X \to P_{k+l}$.
These are compatible and hence give the desired morphism $P_k \otimes P_k \to P_{k+l}$.

This construction is spelled out for instance in the proof of [SchwedeShipley, lemma 6.2](#SchwedeShipley)

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

First we need to discuss that this definition is actually consistent, in that the morphism $\lim_\to K^- \to P_{n-1}$ is well defined and the monoid structure on $P$ is well defined.

(...)

That $X \to P$ is a morphism of monoids follows then essentially by the definition of the monoid structure on $P$.

Finally we need to check the universal property of the cocone $P$ obtained this way:

### Model structure

If $C$ is a [[monoidal model category]], then $Mon(C)$ may inherit itself the structure of a [[model category]]. See [[model structure on monoids in a monoidal model category]].
