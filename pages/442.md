## Idea

In his 1963 doctoral dissertation, Bill Lawvere introduced a new categorical method for doing [[universal algebra]], alternative to the usual way of presenting an algebraic concept by means of its logical [[signature (in logic)|signature]] (with generating operations satisfying equational axioms). The rough idea is to define an [[algebraic theory]] as a [[category]] with finite [[product]]s and possessing a "generic algebra" (e.g., a generic [[group]]), and then define a [[model]] of that [[theory]] (e.g., a group) as a product-preserving [[functor]] out of that [[category]]. This type of category is what is nowadays called a _Lawvere algebraic theory_, or just Lawvere theory. 


## Definition

A **Lawvere [[theory]]** or **finite-product theory** is a [[category]] $T$ with finite cartesian [[product|products]] in which every [[object]] is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a finite cartesian power $x^n$ of a distinguished object $x$ (called the _generic object_ for the theory $T$). It is common to adopt the (slightly [[evil]]) convention that every object of $T$ is _equal_ to a chosen power of $x$. Thus, if $Fin$ is the category of finite cardinals and functions between them, then the unique (up to isomorphism) product-preserving functor 
$$Fin^{op} \to T$$ 
that takes the 1-element cardinal to $x$ is commonly supposed to be surjective on objects (rather than, less evilly, [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]), or even an isomorphism on objects so that each morphism $x^n \to x$ has a well-defined [[signature (in logic)|arity]] $n$. 

A **[[model]]** of $T$ is a product-preserving functor $T \to Set$, and _homomorphism of models_ is a natural transformation between such functors. A _morphism_ of theories $T \to T'$ is again a product-preserving functor. Thus, $Fin^{op}$ (the "theory of [[equality]]") is initial in the category of Lawvere theories. 


### Remarks

1. If $C$ is a category with finite products, then a group (object) in $C$ may be defined as a product-preserving functor $T_{Grp} \to C$. For example, a topological group may be identified with a functor $T_{Grp} \to Top$, and a Lie group with a product-preserving functor $T_{Grp} \to Man$ into the category of smooth [[manifold]]s. An analogous statement holds for any finitary algebraic theory, when formulated in terms of its Lawvere theory $T$. 

1. Some people use 'finite-product theory' to mean any (small) category with finite products, reserving 'Lawvere theory' to refer to finite product theories with the property that every object is isomorphic to a product of finitely many copies of a given object $x$. Finite-product theories $C$ can be regarded as a special case of multisorted Lawvere theories (see below) where the set of sorts is $Ob(C)$ itself. Some, but not all, the above discussion generalizes to this case. 

1. As _finite-product theories_, Lawvere theories are at one end of a spectrum of [[theory|theories]] of differing logical strengths. For example, there are left exact theories, regular theories, geometric theories, and so on, which require for their interpretation categories of differing degrees of strength in their [[internal logic]]. See also [[classifying topos]].


### Variations

* A **multisorted** or multityped Lawvere theory for a given set of sorts $S$ is a category with finite products $C$ together with a function $i: S \to Ob(C)$ such that every object of $C$ is isomorphic to a finite product of objects of the form $i(S)$. An example is the theory for ring-module pairs, which may be regarded as a two-sorted theory in which one sort is interpreted as a ring and the other as a module over that ring. 

* An [[infinitary Lawvere theory]] allows for infinitary operations.  An example is the theory of [[suplattices]], where we have, for every [[cardinal number]] $n$, an operation to take the [[supremum]] of $n$ elements.  While Lawvere theories correspond to finitary monads on $Set$, infinitary Lawvere theories correspond to arbitrary monads.

* A [[Fermat theory]] is a Lawvere theory equipped with a notion of differentiation.






## Examples

### The theory of sets {#TheoryOfSets}

The tautological example of a Lawvere theory is the algebraic theory of _no_ operations. This is also called the **theory of equality**.

Its syntactic category is the category $\mathcal{S}$ on objects $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with morphisms generated by the projections $\pi_i : n \to 1$. This is the [[opposite category]] of the category [[FinSet]]

$$
  \mathcal{S} \simeq FinSet^{op}
  \,.
$$


An algebra over this theory is just a bare [[set]]:

$$
  \mathcal{S} Alg \simeq Set
  \,.
$$

For $T$ any Lawvere theory, there is a canonical morphism $\mathcal{S} \to T$. On categories of algebras this induces the functor

$$
  U_T : T Alg \to \mathcal{S}Alg \simeq Set
  \,.
$$

This sends each algebra to its _underlying set_ . For more on this see the section [Free T-algebras](#FreeAlgebras) below.

### The theory of groups

We consider here the theory of [[group]]s (defined however you like). To get the corresponding Lawvere theory $T$, let $F(n)$ (for any natural number $n \geq 0$) be a free group on $n$ generators, and define the Lawvere theory $T_{Grp}$ to be the category [[opposite category|opposite]] to the category of free groups $F(n)$ and group homomorphisms. The generic object $x$ of $T_{Grp}$ is taken to be $F(1)$. 

The category of free groups has finite coproducts since $F(m) + F(n) \cong F(m+n)$ (in other words, the inclusion 

$$FreeGroup \hookrightarrow Group$$ 

creates coproducts in $FreeGroup$), so $T_{Grp}$ has finite products, and we have $F(n) = x^n$ in $T_{Grp}$. Any group $G$ defines a product-preserving functor 

$$T_{Grp} = FreeGroup^{op} \hookrightarrow Group^{op} \stackrel{\hom(-, G)}{\to} Set$$ 

since contravariant hom-functors take coproducts to products. Thus any group gives a model of $T_{Grp}$. 

The other direction is more interesting. Let 

$$M: T_{Grp} \to Set$$ 

be a model of $T_{Grp}$, i.e., a product-preserving functor. We will define a group structure on $G = M(x)$, the underlying set of the group. 

To understand this, let's consider how group multiplication would be defined. The idea is that $x$ in $T_{Grp}$ is a "generic group", so we first need to understand how multiplication works there. The idea is that the product 
in the generic group 
$$m: x^2 \to x^1$$ 
corresponds to a homomorphism 
$$F(1) \to F(2)$$
which by freeness corresponds to an element $1 \to F(2)$, and the element we are after should the product $a b$ of the generators $a, b$ of the free group $F(2) = F(a, b)$. The generators $a, b$ themselves correspond to the two coproduct inclusions 
$$i_1: F(1) \to F(1) + F(1) = F(2) \qquad i_2: F(1) \to F(1) + F(1) = F(2)$$ 

Then, since $M$ is assumed to [[exact functor|preserve products]], we obtain a map 
$$G \times G = M(x) \times M(x) \cong M(x^2) \stackrel{M(m)}{\to} M(x) = G$$ 
and this defines the group multiplication on $G$. The group identity and group inversion on $G$ are defined by following similar recipes. 

It may be checked that the notion of homomorphism of $T_{Grp}$-models (as defined above) coincides with the usual notion of group homomorphism. In summary, the category of groups is equivalent to the category of models of $T_{Grp}$. 

In particular, any hom-functor 

$$\hom_{T_{Grp}}(x^n, -): T_{Grp} \to Set$$ 

preserves products, and so defines a group. This group is precisely the free group on $n$ generators, and a little thought shows that the $n$ generators correspond to the natural transformations 
$$\hom_{T_{Grp}}(x, -) \to \hom_{T_{Grp}}(x^n, -)$$
induced by the $n$ projection maps $x^n \to x$. 

All of the discussion above for the case of groups generalizes to any finitary [[algebraic theory]] (i.e., any single-sorted theory whose signature consists of function symbols of finite arity, subject to universally quantified equational axioms). In summary: 

* The Lawvere theory $T$ is the category opposite to the category of free algebras on finitely many generators, 

* The category of algebras is in turn equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors $T \to Set$, and 

* The free algebras are retrieved as the representable functors $T \to Set$. 

As discussed in the article on [[operad|operads]], the notion of Lawvere theory may also be formulated in terms of operads relative to the theory of [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal categories]]. 

### Other examples

* For $k$ a [[field], the category of _free $k$-associative algebras_ is the (syntactic category of the) theory of ordinary [[associative algebra]]s over $k$.

* The category [[CartSp]] is the (syntactic category of the) theory of [[smooth algebra]]s. This is also a [[Fermat theory]].

## Properties


### Coequalizers of $T$-algebras

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition
**(congruence)**
{#congruence}

Let $T$ be a Lawvere theory and $A$ a $T$-algebra. A **congruence**  on $A$  is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set $A(1)$ such that whenever for all $n \on \mathbb{N}$ whenever any $(a_i \in A(1))_{i=1}^n$ and $(b_i \in A(1))_{i=1}^n$ are pairwise eqivalent, $a_i \sim b_i$, then also for every operation $f \in T(n,1)$ the results are equivalent: $f(a_1, \cdot, a_n) \sim f(b_1, \cdots , b_n)$.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation/Definition

For $A$ a $T$-algebra and for every [[relation]] $R \subset A(1) \times A(1)$ there is a smallest [congruence](#congruence) on $A$ containing $R$. Write $\langle R \rangle \subset A(1) \times A(1)$ for this smallest congruence.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $A$ a $T$-algebra and $C$ a congruence on $A$, the relation $A/C(f) \subset (A/C)^n \times A/C$ induced by $A(f)$ for each $f : \in T(n,1)$ are functions and define a $T$-algebra structure on $A(1)/C$.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $f,g : A \to B$ two morphisms of $T$-algebras, the canonical morphism
$B \to B/\langle \f(a)\sim g(a) | a \in A(1)\rangle$ is the [[coequalizer]] of $f$ and $g$.

=--




### Free $T$-algebras and underlying sets {#FreeAlgebras}


Write $\mathcal{S}$ for the (syntactic category of the) algebraic theory of sets (described [above](#TheoryOfSets)). Then for $T$ any other (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory, there is a canonicel morphism

$$
  i_T :  \mathcal{S} \to T
  \,.
$$

The corresponding functor on $T$-algebras we write

$$
  U_T : T Alg \to Set
$$

and call the **underlying set** functor.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

The functor $U_T$ has a [[left adjoint]] $F_T : Set \to T Alg$.

=--

This is a standard example of a [[free functor]], called the **free $T$-algebra functor**.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $S \in $ [[Set]], let $F_T(S)$ be the $T$-algebra whose underlying set is the set of formal expressions $\{f(s_1, \cdots, f_n) | f \in T(n,1), s_i \in S\}$ with the evident composition operation. 

=--


+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation


For $S = (n) \in$ [[FinSet]] a _finite set_ with $n$ elements , the free $T$-algebra on $S$ is just the [[representable functor|representable]]

$$
  F_T(S) = T(n,-) : T \to Set
  \,.
$$

The adjunction isomorphism

$$
  T Alg(F_T(S), A) \simeq Set(S, U_T(A)) \simeq  (A(1))^n \simeq A(n)
$$

is in this case just the [[Yoneda lemma]].

$$
  T Alg(T(n,-),A) \simeq A(n)
  \,.
$$

Notice that this extends to a functor

$$
  F_T(-) : FinSet \to T Alg
$$

which is the composite

$$
  F_T(-) : FinSet \stackrel{i_T^{op}}{\to} T^{op}
  \stackrel{j}{\to}
  T Alg
$$

of the [[Yoneda embedding]] with the opposite of the canonical functor
$i_T : FinSet^{op} \simeq \mathcal{S} \to T$ from the theory of sets,
described [above](#TheoryOfSets).

More generally, for $S \in Set$ not necessarily finite, let
$Sub(S)$ be the [[poset]] of finite subsets of $S$ and their inclusions.

Then $F_T(S)$ is the [[filtered colimit]] of the representables 
corresponding to the finite subsets

$$
  F_T(S) \simeq {\lim_{\to}}_{{n \in Sub(S)}} T(n,-)
  \,.
$$

As discussed [below](#CoLimitsOfTAlgebras), these filtered colimits of $T$-algebras are computed objectwise.

=--




### Adjunctions of relatively free $T$-algebras {#AdjCatAlgs}


The following establishes that more generally any morphism of Lawvere theories leads to an adjunction between their categories of algebras. 


Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be Lawvere theories and $f : T_1 \to T_2$ a morphism. Write
$f^* : T_2 Alg \to T_1 Alg $ for the functor on categories of algebras induced by precomosition with $f$.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

The functor $f^*$ has a [[left adjoint]] $f_* : T_1 Alg \to T_2 Alg$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Here is an elementary proof:

Let $F_{T_i} \dashv U_{T_i}$ be the two [free algebra/underlying-set adjunctions](#FreeAlgebras). For $A$ a $T_1$-algebra there is a $T_1$-[congruence](#congruence) $\Gamma$ such that

$$
  A \simeq F_{T_1} U_{T_1}(A) / \Gamma
  \,.
$$ 

Since for any set $S$ we have $U_{T_1} F_{T_1}(S) \subset U_{T_2} F_{T_2}(S)$ it follows that $\Gamma \subset T_{T_2} F_{T_2} U_{T_1}(A)$. For $\langle \Gamma \rangle$ the smallest $T_2$-congruence containing $\Gamma$ we have that $F_{T_2} U_{T_1}(A) / \langle \Gamma \rangle$ is a $T_2$-algebra. 

This one checks is  $f_* A$.


Here is a more high-powered way to obtain this using the [[monad]]s $K_i$ whose algebras are $T_i$-algebras:

for $A$ a $T_1$-algebra let $f_* A  := K_2 \circ_{K_1} A$ the the evident reflexive [[coequalizer]} 

$$
  K_2 K_1 A \stackrel{\to}{\to} K_2 A \to K_2 \circ_{K_1} A
$$ 

in $T_2 Alg$.

=--

### Limits and colimits of $T$-algebras {#CoLimitsOfTAlgebras}

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $T$ a Lawvere algebra, the category $T Alg$ has all small [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s. 

The [[limit]]s and the [[filtered colimit]]s in $T Alg$ are computed pointwise.
