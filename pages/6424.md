## Definition

A __Specker sequence__ is a [[bounded function|bounded]] [[computable function|computable]] [[increasing function|increasing]] [[infinite sequence]] of [[rational numbers]] with no [[computable number|computable]] [[supremum]].


## Examples

Since there is a sequence of all [[Turing machine|Turing machines]], define a sequence $(S_n)_n$ as
$$ S_n = \sum_{i + j = n} 2^{-i} \{i\}_j ,$$
where $\{i\}_j$ is the [[bit]] ($0$ or $1$) giving whether the $i$th Turing machine halts before $j$ steps.  The theoretical limit of this sequence is
$$ \sum_i 2^{-i} \{i\} ,$$
where $\{i\}$ is the bit giving whether the $i$th Turing machine halts at all, but this is uncomputable (on pain of solving the [[halting problem]]).


## In constructive mathematics

In [[Russian constructivism]], all [[real numbers]] are computable, so a Specker sequence has no (located) supremum, giving a counterexample to the [[classical mathematics|classical]] [[least upper bound principle]] ($LUP$).

In many other varieties of [[constructive mathematics]], the computability of all real numbers can be neither proved nor refuted, but Specker sequences still provide [[weak counterexample|weak counterexamples]], since $LUP$ is equivalent to [[excluded middle]].
