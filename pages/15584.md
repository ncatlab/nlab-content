[[!redirects graphics]]

##Idea

A simple class of (finite) [[monoids]] and [[categories]] that permit an effective graphic display via their [[presheaf]] categories.


## Definition

A monoid $M$ is called _graphic_ if all $x,y\in M$ satisfy the so called _graphic identity_ $x y x=x y$ . A category $\mathcal{G}$ is called _graphic_ if the endomorphism monoid $End(x)$ is a graphic monoid for each object $x$.

### Remark

The terminology originates with Lawvere ([1989b](#Law89b)) where graphic monoids and categories $\mathcal{G}$ are demanded to be _finite_.

_Graphic toposes_ were defined then as $FinSet^{\mathcal{G}^{op}}$ resulting in  presheaf categories of finite graph-like 'displays' that come with a well-behaved lattice of subtoposes permitting the kind of 'Hegelian analysis' that were a primary concern for [[Lawvere]] in ([Law89b](#Law89b), [Law91](#Law91), [Law02](#Law02)).[^hegel]

[^hegel]: In particular, the graphics like the $\Delta_1$ in the [example](#ex) or the eight element _Hegelian taco_ monoid of (Lawvere [1989b](#Law89b)), express diagrammatically configurations of [[level|essential subtoposes]] occuring in Lawvere's mathematical rendering of basic concepts of Hegel's dialectic logic. For more on Lawvere's approach to Hegelian dialectics see at [[Aufhebung]], [[adjoint cylinder]], or [[Science of Logic]].

##Example{#ex}

The principal example of a graphic category is $\Delta_1$ the three element monoid $\{\delta_1,\delta_2,1\}$ with $\delta_i\delta_j=\delta_i$. The presheaf topos $Set^{\Delta_1^{op}}$ is the topos of [[reflexive graphs]].

To see this, recall that a _reflexive graph_ consists of a set of vertices $V$, a set of edges $E$, source and target maps $s, t : E \to V$, and a map $i : V \to E$ assigning to each vertex an 'identity edge' from that vertex to itself, so that $s(i(v)) = t(i(v)) = v$.  

We can describe a reflexive graph without ever mentioning its vertices by using the identity edge $i(v)$ as a stand-in for $v$.  To do this, we 
define operations $\delta_1, \delta_2 : E \to E$ by 

$$  \delta_1(e) = i(s(e)), \qquad \delta_2(e) = i(t(e)) $$

and note that

$$ \delta_1(\delta_1(e)) = \delta_2(\delta_1(e)) = \delta_1(e) $$

$$ \delta_1(\delta_2(e)) = \delta_2(\delta_2(e)) = \delta_2(e) $$

Thus, the reflexive graph determines a functor $F : \Delta_1^{op} \to \Set$, where we think of the monoid $\Delta_1$ as a one-object category.  In other words, it gives a presheaf on $\Delta_1$.  Conversely, any presheaf on $\Delta_1$ determines a reflexive graph.

The more familiar two-sorted 'signature' for reflexive graphs, obtains from the [[Cauchy completion]] $\overline\Delta_1$ by identification of the isomorphic descendents of $\delta_1,\delta_2$: the resulting $\tilde\Delta_1$ has two objects and is basically an augmentation with reflexivity data of the familiar diagram $V\rightrightarrows E$ that underlies the topos of ("irreflexive") directed graphs, or [[quiver|quivers]]. All three of $\Delta_1,\overline\Delta_1,\tilde\Delta_1$ are graphic categories and the resulting presheaf toposes are, of course, equivalent.

##Properties

* Lawvere calls the graphic identity _'the least common generalization of constant (x=c) and identity (x=1)_' ([1989b](#Law89b), p.53). By a _constant_ $c$ is meant here a $c\in M$ such that $cy=c$ for all $y\in M$.

* In a graphic monoid every element is [[idempotent]] as can be directly seen from the graphic identity with $y=1$.

* It follows that a commutative graphic monoid is the same as a [[semilattice]], or equivalently, a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent.

* The _free graphic monoid_ on a set $X$ is the set of totally ordered finite subsets of $X$, where the product of finite subsets $S$ and $T$ is the union $S \cup T$ ordered in such a way that the inclusion $S \hookrightarrow S\cup T$ is order-preserving, the inclusion $T \hookrightarrow S\cup T$ is order-preserving for all elements of $T$ not in $S$, and all the elements of $T$ not in $S$ are greater than all elements of $S$.  This is easy to understand from an example.  Consider the free graphic monoid on $X = \{a,b\}$.  This contains:

  1 (corresponding to the empty subset of $X$), 

  $a$ (corresponding to the subset $\{a\}$), 

  $b$ (corresponding to $\{b\}$), 

  $a b$ (corresponding to $\{a,b\}$ ordered so that $a \lt b$),

  $b a$ (corresponding to $\{a,b\}$ ordered so that $b \lt a$),

  and nothing else, since for example $a b b = a b$ and $b a b = b a$ (since the union of ordered subsets $\{a,b\} \cup \{b\} = \{a, b\}$ inherits the same ordering that $\{a,b\}$ had).

* In particular, for a finite set of generators the free graphic monoid is finite and consists of all words without repetitions.[^schuetz]

[^schuetz]: The finiteness was basically already observed in Schützenberger ([1947](#Schütz47)). See also Lawvere ([1989b](#Law89b)).

### Graphic monoids as shelves

There is a relation between graphic monoids and [[shelf|shelves]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #GraphicsAsShelves}
###### Theorem

A graphic monoid is the same as a _unital [[left shelf]]_, meaning a set equipped with a binary operation that obeys the left self-distributive law

$$  a (b c) = (a b)(a c) $$

and has an element $1$ serving as a left and right unit:

$$  1 a = a = a 1$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First start with a unital left shelf.  Note that the graphic identity
holds:

   $$ a  b = a (b 1) = (a b) (a 1) = (a  b)  a $$

   and also

   $$ a  b = a  (1  b) = (a  1)  (a  b) = a  (a  b) $$

   Using these and self-distributivity we can deduce the associative law as follows:

   $$\begin{aligned}
a  (b  c) &= (a  b)  (a  c) \\
&= ((a  b)  a)  ((a  b)  c) \\
&= (a  b)  ((a  b)  c) \\
&= (a  b)  c
\end{aligned}$$

   So, we have a graphic monoid.

   Conversely, suppose we start with a graphic monoid.  Then we can prove the left self-distributive law as follows:

   $$ a (b c) = (a b) c = (a b a) c = (a b)(a c)  $$

Note in particular that, somewhat surprisingly, the **associativity** in a unital left shelf comes for free! For more background see the comments on:
