##Idea
A simple class of finite [[monoids]] and [[categories]] that permit an effective graphic display via their [[presheaf]] categories.


##Definition

A finite monoid $M$ is called _graphic_ if all $x,y\in M$ satisfy the so called _graphic identity_ $x y x=x y$. A finite category $\mathcal{G}$ is called _graphic_ if the endomorphism monoid $End(x)$ is a graphic monoid for all objects $x$.

##Example

The principal example of a graphic category is $\Delta_1$ the three element monoid $\{\delta_1,\delta_2,1\}$ with $\delta_i\delta_j=\delta_i$, or its [[Cauchy completion]] $\overline\Delta_1$. The presheaf topos $\mathcal{S}^{\Delta_1^{op}}$ is the topos of [[reflexive graphs]].

To see this, recall that a _reflexive graph_ consists of a set of vertices $V$, a set of edges $E$, source and target maps $s, t : E \to V$, and a map $i : V \to E$ assigning to each vertex an 'identity edge' from that vertex to itself, so that $s(i(v)) = t(i(v)) = v$.  

We can describe a reflexive graph without ever mentioning its vertices by using the identity edge $i(v)$ as a stand-in for $v$.  To do this, we 
define operations $\delta_1, \delta_2 : E \to E$ by 

$$  \delta_1(e) = i(s(e)), \qquad \delta_2(e) = i(t(e)) $$

and note that

$$ \delta_1(\delta_1(e)) = \delta_2(\delta_1(e)) = \delta_1(e) $$

$$ \delta_1(\delta_2(e)) = \delta_2(\delta_2(e)) = \delta_2(e) $$

Thus, the reflexive graph determines a functor $F : \Delta_1^{op} \to \Set$, where we think of the monoid $\Delta_1$ as a one-object category.  In other words, it gives a presheaf on $\Delta_1$.  Conversely, any presheaf on $\Delta_1$ determines a reflexive graph.

##Properties

* Lawvere (1989b, p.53) calls the graphic identity _'the least common generalization of constant (x=c) and identity (x=1)_'.

* In a graphic monoid every element is [[idempotent]] as can be directly seen from the graphic identity with $y=1$.

* It follows that a commutative graphic monoid is the same as a [[semilattice]], or equivalently, a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent.

* The free graphic monoid on a set $X$ is the set of totally ordered finite subsets of $S$, where the product of finite subsets $S$ and $T$ is the union $S \cup T$ ordered in such a way that the inclusions $S \hookrightarrow X$, $T \hookrightarrow X$ are order-preserving and all the elements of $T$ not in $S$ are greater than all elements of $S$.  This is easy to understand from an example.  Consider the free graphic monoid on $X = \{a,b\}$.  This contains:

  1 (corresponding to the empty subset of $X$), 

  $a$ (corresponding to the subset $\{a\}$), 

  $b$ (corresponding to $\{b\}$), 

  $a b$ (corresponding to $\{a,b\}$ ordered so that $a \lt b$),

  $b a$ (corresponding to $\{a,b\}$ ordered so that $b \lt a$),

  and nothing else, since for example $a b b = a b$ and $b a b = b a$ (since the union of ordered subsets $\{a,b\} \cup \{b\} = \{a, b\}$ inherits the same ordering that $\{a,b\}$ had).

* There is a relation between graphic monoids and [[shelf|shelves]]:

**Theorem.**  A graphic monoid is the same as a _unital [[left shelf]]_, meaning a set equipped with a binary operation that obeys the left self-distributive law

$$  a (b c) = (a b)(a c) $$

and has an element $1$ serving as a left and right unit:

$$  1 a = a = a 1$$

**Proof.** First start with a unital left shelf.  Note that the graphic identity
holds:

   $$ a  b = a (b 1) = (a b) (a 1) = (a  b)  a $$

   and also

   $$ a  b = a  (1  b) = (a  1)  (a  b) = a  (a  b) $$

   Using these and self-distributivity we can deduce the associative law as follows:

   $$\begin{aligned}
a  (b  c) &= (a  b)  (a  c) \\
&= ((a  b)  a)  ((a  b)  c) \\
&= (a  b)  ((a  b)  c) \\
&= (a  b)  c
\end{aligned}$$

   So, we have a graphic monoid.

   Conversely, suppose we start with a graphic monoid.  Then we can prove the left self-distributive law as follows:

   $$ a (b c) = (a b) c = (a b a) c = (a b)(a c) \qquad \qed $$
