## Idea

The origins of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] go back to ideas on [[quantum electrodynamics]] due to [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Freeman Dyson]].

While highly succesful, the conceptual nature of the original formulation, in particular of the process of [[renormalization]] ("removal of [[UV-divergences]]"), had remained mysterious. In [Feynman 85, Chap. 4. "Loose Ends"](#Feynman85) it still says:

> {#Feynman85SuchABunchOfWords} ...is technically called 'renormalization.' But no matter how clever the word, it is what I would call a dippy process! Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory $[...]$ is self-consistent. It's surprising that the theory still hasn't been proved self-consistent one way or the other by now; $[...]$ What is certain is that we do not have a good mathematical way to describe the theory of quantum electrodynamics: such a bunch of words... ([Feynman 85, Chap. 4. "Loose Ends"](#Feynman85))

These conceptial mysteries were later resolved in a mathematically rigorous formulation of [[renormalization]] in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]] by ([Epstein-Glaser 73](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#EpsteinGlaser73)), based on ([Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#BogoliubovShirkov59) and [Stückelberg 51](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Stueckelberg51)), now known as _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ and _[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_; laid out, together with other rigorous approaches, in the seminal Erice summer school proceedings ([Velo-Wightman 76](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#VeloWightman76)).
