
Semantics in [[computer science]] is a field concerned with models of meaning of programming language constructs, what the constructions actually do in execution. In fact, semantics in computer science (and cybernetics) nowdays is often considered also beyond language constructs and deals also with semantics of more general signals, codes and processes, especially within concurrency models.
