## Definition

An **inverse semigroup** is a [[semigroup]] $S$ (a set with an associative binary operation) such that for every element $s\in S$, there exists a *unique* "inverse" $s^*\in S$ such that $s s^* s = s$ and $s^* s s^* = s^*$.

## Examples

* The fundamental example is the following: for any set $X$, let $I(X)$ be the set of all partial [[bijections]] on $X$, i.e. bijections between subsets of $X$.  The composite of partial bijections is their composite as [[relations]] (or as [[partial functions]]).

This inverse semigroup plays a role in the theory similar to that of [[permutation]] groups in the theory of [[groups]].  It is also paradigmatic of the general philosophy that

> Groups describe global symmetries, while inverse semigroups describe local symmetries.

Other examples include:

* If $X$ is a topological space, let $\Gamma(X)\subseteq I(X)$ consist of the homeomorphisms between open subsets of $X$.  Then $\Gamma(X)$ is a [[pseudogroup of transformations]] on $X$ (a general pseudogroup of transformations is a sub-inverse-semigroup of $\Gamma(X)$).

Lots to say here: the meet-[[semilattice]] of [[idempotents]], the connection with [[ordered groupoid]]s, various representation theorems.
