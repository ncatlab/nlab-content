## Idea

The concept of _logrithmic connection_ is that of _[[connection on a bundle]]_ in the context of [[logarithmic geometry]]. Hence a logarithmic connection is a connection ([[principal connection]] or [[connection on a vector bundle]] etc.) on some [[space]] $X$ whose local connection [[differential 1-form]] $A$ is allowed to have logarithmic [[singularities]] at a prescribed subspace $D \hookrightarrow X$, hence is allowed to be a [[differential form with logarithmic singularities]].
