A **Freyd category** can be defined as

* a small category $\mathbb{V}$ with finite products;
* a small category $\mathbb{C}$;
* an action of $\mathbb{V}$ on $\mathbb{C}$ (with the finite products providing a symmetric monoidal structure for $\mathbb{V}$)
* an identity-on-objects functor $\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{C}$ that preserves the actions.

This definition is due to: *Paul Blain Levy, “Call-by-Push-Value. A Functional/Imperative Synthesis,” Semantic Structures in Computation 2, Springer, 2004; appendix B* as paraphrased by _Staton, S., 2014. Freyd categories are Enriched Lawvere Theories. Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, Proceedings of the Workshop on Algebra, Coalgebra and Topology (WACT 2013) 303, 197–206. doi:10.1016/j.entcs.2014.02.010_. 

Staton shows that a Freyd category is equivalent to a Lawvere theory enriched in a locally $\emptyset$-presentable cartesian closed category.
