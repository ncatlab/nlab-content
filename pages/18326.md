## Definition

A **Freyd category** [Levy 04](#Levy04) may be defined as

* a [[small category]] $\mathbb{V}$ with [[finite products]];
* a small category $\mathbb{C}$, that has the same objects as $\mathbb{V}$[^sameObjs];
* an [[action]] of $\mathbb{V}$ on $\mathbb{C}$ (with the finite products providing a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]] for $\mathbb{V}$)
* an [[identity-on-objects functor]] $\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{C}$ that preserves the actions.

[^sameObjs]: Having the same objects is required or implied by having an identity-on-objects functor from $\mathbb{V}$ to $\mathbb{C}$.
## Properties

### Relation to Lawvere theories

[Staton 14](#Staton14) shows that a Freyd category is equivalent to a [[Lawvere theory]] enriched in a locally $\emptyset$-presentable [[cartesian closed category]].
