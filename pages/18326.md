## Idea

A **Freyd category** is one way to axiomatize models of [[call-by-value]] programming languages.
It abstracts the structure of the [[Kleisli category]] of a [[monad in computer science|monad]], consisting of a category $\mathbb{V}$ that model values and another category with the same objects $\mathbb{C}$ that model computations.

Freyd categories resolve the following complaint about using [[monad]]s and [[Kleisli category|Kleisli categories]] to model impure effects in programming languages. The Kleisli category for a monad presumes the existence of some slightly higher-order types, since if $X$ is an object then so is $T(X)$, and yet it is surely possible to understand the nature of effectful computation without also assuming the existence of certain types. Freyd categories make sense even for purely first order programming languages, and the object $T(X)$, if it exists, has a universal property, thus decoupling this relationship. 

## Definition

A **Freyd category** (following [Levy 04](#Levy04)) may be defined as

* a [[category]] $\mathbb{V}$ with [[finite products]];
* a category $\mathbb{C}$, that has the same objects as $\mathbb{V}$[^sameObjs];
* an [[action]] of $\mathbb{V}$ on $\mathbb{C}$ (with the finite products providing a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]] for $\mathbb{V}$)
* an [[identity-on-objects functor]] $\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{C}$ that preserves the actions.

[^sameObjs]: Having the same objects is required or implied by having an identity-on-objects functor from $\mathbb{V}$ to $\mathbb{C}$.

An alternative but equivalent definition is as follows (following [Power, Thielecke](#PH99)):

A Freyd category is given by 

* a category $\mathbb{V}$ with finite products;
* a symmetric [[premonoidal category]] $\mathbb{C}$, that has the same objects as $\mathbb{V}$;
* an identity-on-objects functor $\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{C}$ preserving strict symmetric premonoidal structure, whose image lies in the centre of $\mathbb{C}$. 

## Properties

### Relation to strong monads. 

If $T$ is a [[strong monad]] on a category $\mathbb{V}$ with finite products, then the Kleisli category of $T$ forms a Freyd category and $J$ has a right adjoint. 

Conversely, if $(\mathbb{V},\mathbb{C},J)$ is a Freyd category and $J$ has a right adjoint $R$, then the Freyd category arises as the [[Kleisli category]] of the monad $RJ$.

### Relation to Lawvere theories

[Staton 14](#Staton14) shows that to give a small Freyd category is to give an [[enriched Lawvere theory]] relative to the empty [[sound doctrine]] where the enriching category is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

This relates to the situation with monads as follows. If $T$ is a strong monad on the [[presheaf]] category $\hat{\mathbb{V}}$ then the 
Kleisli category $\hat{\mathbb{V}}\to (\hat{\mathbb{V}})^T$ is a Freyd category. 
But also the identity-on-objects/full-and-faithful factorization of the composite $\mathbb{V}\to \hat{\mathbb{V}}\to (\hat{\mathbb{V}})^T$
yields a Freyd category over $\mathbb{V}$. 

Every Freyd category arises in this way, giving a correspondence between colimit-preserving monads on $\hat{\mathbb{V}}$ and Freyd categories over $\mathbb{V}$.
