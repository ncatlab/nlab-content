## Disambiguation

There are other mathematical uses of the term 'locus'. See, for example, [[smooth locus]] and [[derived critical locus]].

## Idea

A **locus** is a $(\infty, 1)$-category $C$ such that the $(\infty, 1)$-category of [[indexed families]] of objects of $C$ over [[∞-groupoids]] form a [[(∞,1)-topos]].  Since $(\infty, 1)$-toposes are closed under [[left exact functor|left exact]] [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|localizations]], so are loci.  


## Examples

The $(\infty, 1)$-category of [[pointed object|pointed types]] is a locus, since families of it are a presheaf $(\infty, 1)$-category (the $(\infty, 1)$-category of [[retractions]] or of [[diagrams]] on the [[walking]] map-equipped-with-a-[[section]]).  

Similarly, the $(\infty, 1)$-category of [[prespectra]] is a locus.  And the $(\infty, 1)$-category of spectra is a left exact localization of the $(\infty, 1)$-category of prespectra.  Hence [[spectra]] form a locus, so [[parametrized spectra]] form an $(\infty, 1)$-topos.
