## Idea

In [[mathematics]], by a *locus* one typically means a kind of [[subspace]] of [[points]] satisfying some prescribed conditions.

For example: 

* a *[[critical locus]]* is a subspace of [[critical points]] in the [[domain]] of a [[differentiable function]];

* a *[[fixed locus]]* is a subspace of [[fixed points]] under a [[group action]];

* the term *algebraic locus* is sometimes used (e.g. [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|Moerdijk & Reyes 1991, p. 8]] or [arXiv:1604.07827, p. 1-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07827)) for what more commonly are called *[[varieties]]*, namely subspaces of [[solutions]] to [[polynomial]] [[equations]];

  similarly, there is a notion of *[[smooth locus]]*.

## Unrelated entries

Un-related to this standard use of "locus" is the notion of *[[Joyal locus]]* in ([[higher topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]].
