## Idea

What is called _Liouville integrability_ is one formalization of the notion of __classical [[integrable system]]__ in [[physics]].

A [[physical system]] is called **Liouville integrable** if it admits [[canonical coordinates]] and [[canonical momenta]] which are generated from the flow of a maximal set of commuting [[Hamiltonians]].

## Definition

A [[physical system]] given by a [[phase space]] [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$ and equipped with a [[Hamiltonian]] $H_0 \in C^\infty(C)$ (generating time evolution) is said to be **Liouville integrable** or to be an **[[integrable system]] in the sens of [[Liouville]]**  if 

* there are $(dim X -1)$ other Hamiltonian functions $\{H_i\}_{i = 0}^{dim X -1}$ 

* such that

  1. these all commute under the [[Poisson bracket]] with each other;

  1. the [[flow]] of the corresponding [[Hamiltonian vector fields]] generates a [[polarization]] of $(X, \omega)$.
