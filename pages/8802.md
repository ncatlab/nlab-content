## Idea

A _complex [[line]]_ is a [[complex vector space]] of [[dimension]] 1 (of _complex dimension_ that is, as a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space, meaning that as a vector space over the [[real numbers]] it is a [[plane]]).

In particular the [[complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}$ itself is a complex line; conversely, any two complex lines are [[isomorphic]] (to each other and to the complex plane).  However, there are many such isomorphisms; the [[automorphism group]] is $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$.
