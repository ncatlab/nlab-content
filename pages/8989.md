## Idea

A _closure operator_ is a [[monad]] on a [[poset]], typically a [[poset of subobjects]] (of some [[object]]) in some [[category]].  In [[logic]], this is often referred to as a (monadic) _[[modal operator]]_.  The elements of the poset that are fixed by the closure operator are called _closed_ (or perhaps _[[modal type|modal]]_). 

Dually, a [[comonad]] on a poset is called a _co-closure operator_ and the elements fixed by it are called _co-closed_.


## Examples

* A closure operator on a [[power set]] is also called a _[[Moore closure]]_. See there for more.

* One well-known example of a Moore closure is [[topological closure]], which is precisely a Moore closure that preserves finite joins (unions). Similarly, one can view _[[topological interior]]_ as a co-closure operator on a power set that preserves finite meets, or dually as a closure operator on the *[[opposite poset|opposite]]* of a power set that preserves finite [[joins]] (given by [[intersections]] of subsets).

* A [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] is a closure operator on the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ of a [[topos]] $E$, viewed as an internal [[meet-semilattice]]. More precisely, it is a just such a closure operator that preserves internal finite meets. Externally, $\hom(-, \Omega) \colon E^{op} \to Set$ provides an example of a [[universal closure operator]].
