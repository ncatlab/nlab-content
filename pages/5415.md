A 2-adjunction is a common name for various kinds of adjunctions in 2-category theory; not only adjunctions among 2-categories but adjunctions within an arbitrary 3-category (typically defined within a Gray-category). This involves strict 2-adjunctions in strict 2-categories, then [[pseudoadjunction]]s, [[biadjunction]]s, [[lax 2-adjunction]]s, colax 2-adjunctions.
