A **Polish space** is a [[topological space]] that's [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[separable space|separable]] [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Every [[second countable space|second countable]] [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is a Polish space, among others.

Polish spaces provide a useful framework for doing [[measure theory]].  As with any topological space, we can take a Polish space and regard it as a [[measurable space]] with its $\sigma$-algebra of [[Borel set]]s.  Then, there is a very nice classification of Polish spaces up to measurable bijection: there is one for each [[countable set|countable]] [[cardinality]], one whose cardinality is that of the [[continuum]], and no others.

Why are Polish spaces 'not very big'?  In other words, why are there none with cardinality exceeding the continuum?  As with any separable metric space, it's because any Polish space has a countable dense subset and you can write any point as a limit of a sequence of points in this subset.  So, you only need a [[sequence]] of integers to specify any point in a Polish space.
