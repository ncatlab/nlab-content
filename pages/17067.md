## Idea

An "ex-space" (terminology due to [James](#James), adopted in [May-Sigurdsson 04](#MaySigurdsson04)) is a general [[bundle]] of [[topological spaces]]/[[homotopy types]] (hence any map of spaces $E \to X$) equipped with a global [[section]] $X \to E$. More generally, an _ex-object_ in any [[category]] or [[(infinity,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & \nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

(In an [[(infinity,1)-category]] this diagram is filled with a [[2-morphism]], a [[homotopy]]. Often this is considered in a [[category of fibrant objects]], or similar, presenting an $(\infty,1)$-category and then $E \to X$ is required to be a [[fibration]].)

One may think of this as a parameterization of [[pointed objects]] over $X$. As such this is a topic in [[parameterized homotopy theory]]. For instance, passing to the fiberwise [[suspension spectra]] of an ex-space $E \to X$ yields a [[parameterized spectrum]] over $X$.

When the ambient category $\mathcal{C}$ is suitably monoidal, then the category of ex-objects with its fiberwise [[smash product]] forms a [[monoidal fibration]]. See at [[dependent linear type theory]] for more on this.
