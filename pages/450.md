A _$0$-fold category_ is a [[set]].  An _$n$-fold category_ for $n \gt 0$ is an [[internal category]] in $(n-1)$-fold categories.

In particular, a $1$-fold category is a [[category]], and a $2$-fold category is a [[double category]] (introduced by [[Charles Ehresmann]] in 1963).

Analogously, an _$n$-fold groupoid_ is an [[internal groupoid]] in $(n-1)$-fold groupoids; in particular, a $1$-fold groupoid is a [[groupoid]].


#Remarks#

* Notice that an $n$-fold category is a _strict_ version of an [[n-category]] in that all $n$ composition operations are strictly unital and associative and strictly commute with each other. Still, $n$-fold groupoids model all [[homotopy n-type]]s. See [[homotopy hypothesis]].

* Analogous to how a [[group]] is a groupoid with a single object, one can consider $(n+1)$-fold groupoids for which all morphisms in one of the $(n+1)$ directions are endomorphisms. These are the [[cat-n-group]]s.

* By a theorem by Brown and Higgins, [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] are equivalent to those $\infty$-fold categories that satisfy a couple of restrictive properties (something like that all 1-categories of $n$-cells for all $n$ are the same and that all the "thin" identity elements exist, called "connections").
