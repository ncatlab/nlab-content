In a [[partial order|poset]] or even [[preorder|proset]], the __down set__ of an element $x$ is the set
$$ x{\downarrow} = \{ y \;|\; x \leq y \} .$$

In a [[quasiorder]], the __strict down set__ of $x$ is the set
$$ x\dot{\downarrow} = \{ y \;|\; x \lt y \} .$$

If you think of a poset $P$ as a [[category]], then the down set of $x$ is the [[coslice category]] $x / P$.

A down set in the [[opposite category|opposite]] $P^{op}$ of $P$ is an [[up set]] in $P$.

Note that the down set of $x$ is the [[lower set]] [[Moore closure|generated by]] $x$; in fact, it is the (order-theoretic) [[ideal]] generated by $x$.
