  _Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres_

  ([web](http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/mu.html))

on [[stable homotopy theory]] in general and in particular the computation of the [[homotopy groups of spheres]] via the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]] and its use of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]].
