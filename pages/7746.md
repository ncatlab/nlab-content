## Idea

_Factorization homology_  is a notion of [[homology theory]] for [[framed manifold|framed]] $n$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifolds]] with coefficients in [[En-algebras]] due to ([Francis](#Francis)). It is similar in spirit to _[[factorization algebras]]_, _[[blob homology]]_ and _[[topological chiral homology]]_. In fact the definition of factorization homology turns out to be equivalent to that of topological chiral topology ([Francis b](#Francisb)).


## References

The definition appears in section 3 of 

* [[John Francis]], _The tangent complex and Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{E}_n$-rings_ ([arXiv:1104.0181](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0181))
