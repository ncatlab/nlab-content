
## Definition

A positively [[graded algebra]] $A$ is called **Koszul** (after [[Jean-Louis Koszul]]) if every graded [[simple object]] has a [[projective resolution]] where the $i$th term is generated in grade $i$.  Equivalently, this holds if the internal and homological gradings on the [[Ext]] $A^!=\Ext_A(A_0,A_0)$ coincide.

The algebra $(A^!)^{\op}$ is itself Koszul and is called the _[[Koszul dual]]_ of $A$.
