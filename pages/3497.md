## Idea

An $(n,1)$-topos is the [[(n,r)-category|(n,1)-cateory]] version of a [[topos]].

It is equivalently an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] in wich all objects are [[n-truncated object of an (infinity,1)-category|n-truncated objects]].

A collection of $(n-1)$-groupoid-valued [[sheaf|sheaves]]/[[stack]]s.
