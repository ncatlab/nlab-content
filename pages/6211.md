## Idea

Analogous to how [[topological T-duality]] describes the aspects of [[T-duality]] that are not related to the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] and the [[background gauge field]], _differential T-duality_ still ignores the metric, but takes the background [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and its effect on the [[RR-field]]s into account: it is a refinement of topological T-duality from [[cohomology]] to [[differential cohomology]].

This is also called _geometric T-duality_ ([KahleValentino](#KahleValentino)), though this is a slight misnomer, since present technnology for the differential refinement does not take the metric into account.

## Definition

## Formulation by twisted differential $\mathbf{c}$-structures

We discuss here how the notion of differential T-duality pairs 
is a special case of the notion of [[twisted differential c-structures]].
