## Definition

In a [[model category]], an **acyclic fibration** or **trivial fibration** is a [[morphism]] which is both a [[fibration]] and a [[weak equivalence]].

Dually, an **acyclic cofibration** or **trivial cofibration** is a morphism which is both a [[cofibration]] and a weak equivalence.
