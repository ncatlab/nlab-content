The term [[convenient category of topological spaces]] is used for a category of [[topological space]]s nice enough to address many of the needs of working topologists, notably including the condition of being a [[cartesian closed category]]. As such, they are examples of [[nice category of spaces|nice categories of spaces]].

A primary example is the category of [[compactly generated space]]s.

While the authors of this article don't know whether there exists in the literature a widely accepted precise definition of "convenient category of topological spaces", it seems reasonable and convenient to suppose it means a [[full subcategory|full]] [[replete subcategory]] $C$ of the category of all topological spaces [[Top]] such that at least the following conditions hold: 

* Every [[CW complex]] is an object of $C$; 

* $C$ is [[cartesian closed]]; 

* $C$ is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]]; 

* $C$ is closed under open subspace inclusions and closed subspace inclusions in [[Top]]. 

It may be well to note that colimits and limits in $C$ need not agree with the corresponding colimits and limits in $Top$, except under certain conditions. For example, because $C$ is a full subcategory of $Top$, the usual sorts of colimits used to present CW complexes are the same whether interpreted in $Top$ or in $C$. Also, because $C$ is closed under closed subspaces, an equalizer of a pair of maps between Hausdorff spaces in $C$ is the same whether computed in $Top$ or in $C$. On the other hand, products of $C$-objects in $Top$ need not land in $C$, so in that situation the product in $Top$ and the product in $C$ do not agree.
