## Idea

The term [[convenient category of topological spaces]] is used for a category of [[topological space]]s nice enough to address many of the needs of working topologists, notably including the condition of being a [[cartesian closed category]]. As such, they are examples of [[nice category of spaces|nice categories of spaces]].

A primary example is the category of [[compactly generated space]]s.


## Definition

While the authors of this article don't know whether there exists in the literature a widely accepted definition of "convenient category of topological spaces", we propose the following definition as reasonable and convenient (see also the discussion [below](#NvC) on the distinction between "nice" and "convenient"): 

+-- {: .un_def}
######Definition
A **convenient category of topological spaces** is a [[full subcategory|full]] [[replete subcategory]] $C$ of the category of all topological spaces [[Top]] such that the following conditions 1-3 hold: 

1. Every [[CW complex]] is an object of $C$; 

1. $C$ is [[cartesian closed]]; 

1. $C$ is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]]. 

=--

Frequently it is also felt desirable to add closure under certain types of subspace inclusions. For instance, in the well-known examples one has 

* $C$ is closed under closed subspace inclusions in [[Top]], i.e., if $X$ belongs to $C$ and $A \subseteq X$ is a closed subspace (in $Top$), then $A$ also belongs to $C$. 

At times one might hope that $C$ is closed under open subspace inclusions as well, but this does not hold for all objects in some of the well-known examples of convenient categories. 

It may be well to note that colimits and limits in $C$ need not agree with the corresponding colimits and limits in $Top$, except under certain conditions.  Some convenient categories are [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] or coreflective in $Top$, in which case they are closed under limits or colimits respectively.  Moreover, because $C$ is a full subcategory of $Top$ which contains all CW complexes, the usual sorts of colimits used to present CW complexes are the same whether interpreted in $Top$ or in $C$.  Also, if $C$ is closed under closed subspaces, then an equalizer of a pair of maps between Hausdorff spaces in $C$ (being a closed subspace) is the same whether computed in $Top$ or in $C$.

On the other hand, products of $C$-objects in $Top$ need not land in $C$, so in that situation the product in $Top$ and the product in $C$ do not agree.  This is in particular the case for compactly generated spaces.  In fact, the "compactly generated product" is sometimes preferable to the $Top$-product for more explicit reasons: for instance, if $X$ and $Y$ are CW complexes, then $X\times Y$ need not be a CW complex in the usual product topology, but it is in the compactly generated topology.


## Examples

* [[compactly generated space]]

* others to be written.

## Counter examples

* [[locally compact topological space]]s are not cartesian closed

  As a counterexam consider $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ where $\mathbb{N}$ has the usual discrete topology. Discrete spaces are of course locally compact, and the compact-open topology is the usual product topology. But this exponential is not locally compact, because there is an explicit homeomorphism between this space and the space of irrationals in the interval  (0,1) with its usual subspace topology. This homeomorphism is given by the regular continued fraction expansion.


## "Nice" versus "convenient" categories of spaces
{#NvC}

A related entry is [[nice category of spaces]]. Here we explain the difference between "convenient" and "nice" categories of spaces. 

"A convenient category of topological spaces" is the title of a well-known paper by Norman Steenrod, who emphasized particularly function space constructions (i.e., cartesian closure) as a great convenience for working algebraic topologists, on top of (generally less problematic) completeness and cocompleteness assumptions.

It is well-known that $Top$ is not [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].  One can characterize the [[exponential law for spaces|exponentiable spaces]], which include all [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] spaces, but the naive idea of simply cutting down to some of these does not give a good cartesian closed category either, since firstly it need not be complete and cocomplete, and secondly even if $X$ and $Y$ are exponentiable, the exponential $Y^X$ need not be.

However, one can cut down to *some* full subcategory of spaces which does admit function spaces.  This typically involves the subtle and delicate interplay between compactness conditions and openness conditions.  It comes at a cost -- that limits and/or colimits in the subcategory might not be computed as they are in $Top$ -- but this is generally considered a very small price to pay in exchange for the great convenience of these assumptions. 

That a convenient category of topological spaces contains all the CW complexes was not explicitly declared by Steenrod, but we feel certain that algebraic topologists want these as part of their convenient category. In practice this is a mild assumption, because the usual examples certainly contain all finite topological products of the interval $I$, and are closed under those $Top$-colimits used to present CW complexes, as built inductively from the basic spaces $I^n \cong D^n$. 

"Nice categories of spaces" should be thought of as a wider and vaguer term; it really means the category of spaces has "nice" categorical properties for some mathematical purpose at hand. Certainly any convenient category of spaces should be considered a nice category of spaces for the general purposes of algebraic topology. On the other hand, there are categories of spaces which are not "convenient" in the technical sense described above, but which may be very nice for certain purposes. 

For example, the category of [[compact Hausdorff space]]s can be considered as being very nice for certain purposes, because it is monadic over $Set$ (!). It is, however, not "convenient", as it very far from being cartesian closed. Another example of a nice category of spaces, as explained by Johnstone (see the references below), is the category of [[sequential space]]s, but this too is not cartesian closed. In a different direction, there is the (complete, cocomplete) cartesian closed category of [[equilogical space]]s, but this is not a full subcategory of $Top$, and the core concerns of mathematicians working with equilogical spaces are somewhat different from those of algebraic topologists. 

It should also be noted that "[[space]]" itself has a wider meaning than the technical notion of "[[topological space]]", even if topological intuitions come into play. For example, in domain theory, one often considers certain types of posets (for example, [[directed-complete partial order|dcpos]]) as certain types of "spaces". In this direction, we have that the category of dcpos and _Scott-continuous_ maps between them forms a complete, cocomplete, cartesian closed category. However, these types of spaces are quite far removed from the traditional concerns of geometry, hence are not "convenient" in the sense given above (despite the manifold relations between Scott continuity and the point-set topology which underlies the classical results on compactly generated spaces). In another direction, the category of [[locales]] is in some respects "nice", but these are not topological spaces either. 

Along with the entry on [[nice category of spaces]], see also [[subsequential space]], [[Johnstone's topological topos]], and Spanier's [[quasitopological space]]s. None of these is convenient in the precise sense above.
