A __twist__, or __balance__, in a [[braided monoidal category]] $B$ is a [[natural transformation]] from the [[identity functor]] on $B$ to itself satisfying a certain condition that links it to the [[braiding]].  A __balanced monoidal category__ is a braided monoidal category equipped with such a balance.

Every [[symmetric monoidal category]] is balanced in a canonical way; in fact, the [[identity natural transformation]] (on the identity functor of $B$) is a balance on $B$ if and only if $B$ is symmetric.  Thus balanced monoidal categories fall between braided monoidal categories and symmetric monoidal categories.  (They should not be confused with [[balanced categories]], which are unrelated.)

The condition linking the balancing to the braiding, where $\theta$ is the balance and $\beta$ is the braiding, is that $\theta_{x \otimes y}$ should be the [[composite]] of $\beta_{x,y}$, $\theta_y \otimes \theta_x$, and $\beta_{y,x}$.

This definition is taken from [Jeff Egger](http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~jegger/4micah.pdf) (Appendix C), but the original definition is due to [[Andre Joyal|Joyal]] and [[Ross Street|Street]].

In the [[string diagram]] calculus for [[ribbon categories]], the twist is represented by a 360-degree twist in a ribbon.
