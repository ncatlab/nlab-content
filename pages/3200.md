Given a linear differential operator (ordinary or partial) $P$ on a domain $M\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ or a manifold $M$, one can consider both the homogeneous equation $Pf = 0$ and the nonhomogeneous equations of the form $Pf = g$ where $g$ is a given nonhomogeneous term. If $g$ is a delta function, and the boundary conditions are given then the solution of the nonhomogenous equation

$$
Pf = \delta
$$

is called the **fundamental solution** for $P$; alternative names like Green function and function of influence are also used. A particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation for some other $g$ can be obtained by calculating the convolution with the fundamental solution.
