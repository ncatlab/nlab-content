Given a linear [[differential operator]] (ordinary or partial) $P$ on a [[domain]] $M\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ or a [[manifold]] $M$, one can consider both the homogeneous equation $P f = 0$ and the nonhomogeneous equation of the form $P f = g$ where $g$ is a given nonhomogeneous term. If $g$ is a [[delta function]] and the boundary conditions are given, then the solution of the nonhomogenous equation

$$
P f = \delta
$$

is called the **fundamental solution** for $P$; alternative names like __Green function__ and __function of influence__ are also used. A particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation for some other $g$ can be obtained by calculating the [[convolution]] with the fundamental solution. (Compare the fact that the delta function is the [[identity element]] for convolution.)
