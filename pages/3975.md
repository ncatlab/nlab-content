## Idea

Just as a [[functor]] is a [[morphism]] between [[categories]], so a _closed functor_ is a morphism between [[closed categories]].  Closed functors come in varying levels of strictness and strength.


## Definition ##

A __closed functor__ is a [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ between [[closed categories]] that respects [[internal homs]] 

$$F([X,Y])\cong [F(X),F(Y)].$$

[[!redirects closed functors]]
