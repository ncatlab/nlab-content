## Definition

On a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ a **Killing-Yano [[tensor]]** is a [[differential form]] $\omega$ such that 

$$
   \nabla_{(\mu} \omega_{\alpha_0),  \alpha_1, \cdots , \alpha_n}
  = 0
  \,,
$$

where $\nabla$ is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of $g$.

There is also a variant of **conformal Killing-Yano tensors**

(...)

## Properties

Killing-Yano tensors serve as "square roots" of [[Killing tensor]]. In a [[spacetime]] with a [[Killing tensor]] $H$ the [[relativistic particle]] has an extra conserved quantity. If it refines to a Killing-Yano tensor then also the [[spinning particle]] or [[superparticle]] has an extra odd conserved quantity. If $H = g$ then this is an extra worldline [[supersymmetry]].

## Examples

The [[Kerr spacetime]] admits a conformal Killing-Yano tensor (...)
