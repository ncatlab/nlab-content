## Idea

An _orientifold_ is a [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] for [[string theory|string]] [[sigma-models]] that combines aspects of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[orbifold]]s with _[[orientation]] reversal_ on the worldsheet, whence the name.

Where generally ([[higher gauge field|higher gauge]]) [[field (physics)|fields]] in [[physics]]/[[string theory]] are [[cocycles]] in ([[differential cohomology theory|differential]]) [[cohomology theory]] and typically in [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], fields on orientifolds are cocycles in genuinely $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology]] and typically in [[real-oriented cohomology theory]]. For instance the [[B-field]] which otherwise is a (twisted) coycles in ([[ordinary differential cohomology|ordinary]]) [[ordinary cohomology]] over an orientifold is a cocycle in (twisted) [[HZR-theory]], and the [[RR-fields]] which usually are cocycles in ([[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[differential K-theory|differential]]) [[K-theory]] over an orientifold are cocycles in [[KR-theory]] ([Witten 98](#Witten98)).

An explicit models for [[B-fields]] for the [[bosonic string]]  on orientifolds (differential [[HZR-theory]]) given in ([Schreiber-Schweigert-Waldorf 05](#Jandl)) and examples are analyzed in this context in ([Gawedzki-Suszek-Waldorf 08](#GawedzkiSuszekWaldorf08)).

That for the [[superstring]] the B-field is more generally a cocycle with coefficients in the [[Picard infinity-group]] of [[complex K-theory]] ([[super line 2-bundles]]) and a detailed discussion of the orientifold version of this is ([Distler-Freed-Moore 09](#Precis), [Distler-Freed-Moore 10](#DistlerFreedMooreII)) with details in ([Freed 12](#Freed)).

The quadratic pairing entering the [[11d Chern-Simons theory]] that governs the [[RR-field]] here as a [[self-dual higher gauge field]] is given in ([DFM 10, def. 6](#Precis)).

## Properties

### Lift to M-therory F-theory

Lifts of orientifold background from [[type II string theory]] to [[F-theory]] go back to ([Sen 96](Sen96), [Sen 97a](#Sen97a)).

Lifts to [[ADE singularities|D-type ADE singularities]] in [[M-theory]] goes back to ([Sen 97b](#Sen97b)).
