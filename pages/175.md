There are many generalizations and related structures; for example the vertical categorifications of groups like [[2-group]]s, horizontal categorifications as [[groupoids]], groups with structure, like [[topological group]]s, [[Lie group]]s, thus also [[Lie groupoids]], [[Lie infinity-groupoids]]; and noncommutative generalizations like [[quantum groups]]. Lie and algebraic group(oid)s have their infinitesimal precursors like formal groups, local Lie groups, tangent [[Lie algebras]], tangent [[Lie algebroids]] etc. In the smooth context the relation between Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids is the subject of [[Lie theory]].
