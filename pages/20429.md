## Idea

The term _string/string duality_ ([Duff-Khuri 93](#DuffKhuri93)) refers to [[duality in string theory]] which relates a [[perturbative string theory]] (at small [[string coupling constant]]) with another string theory, but now at large [[string coupling]] ([[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]]).

The archetypical example is the [[duality between heterotic and type II string theory]], and often this is taken to be synonymous with "string-string duality".

This is in contrast to [[duality in string theory|dualities]] which relate weakly coupled strings to strongly coupled [[branes]] of other dimension, such as the [[electric-magnetic duality]] which relates the [[heterotic string]] to the [[NS5-brane]] in [[dual heterotic string theory]], or the [[duality between type IIA string theory and M-theory]], which relates the string to the [[membrane]] ([[M2-brane]])
