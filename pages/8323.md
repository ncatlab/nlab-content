## Idea

The _structural rules_ of a [[logic]] are those rules which make no reference to logical operators but only to the unstructured [[premise]]s of a [[deduction]].


## Examples

* the [[weakening rule]],
* the [[contraction rule]],
* the [[exchange rule]],
* the [[identity rule]],
* the [[cut rule]].

## Related pages

* [[substructural logic]] is logic in which one or more structural rules are omitted.
