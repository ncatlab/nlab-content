## Idea

The notion of Reedy category, though useful, is in some contexts inconveniently restrictive, since no Reedy category can contain any nonidentity isomorphisms.  This is problematic for many "shape categories" such as Connes' [[category of cycles]] $\Lambda$, [[Segal's category Gamma|Segal's category]] $\Gamma$, the [[tree category]] $\Omega$, and so on.  The notion of *generalized Reedy category* lifts this restriction, while maintaining the truth of the main theorem about Reedy categories: the existence of the [[Reedy model structure]].

## Definition

### Generalized Reedy category

A **generalized Reedy category** is a category $R$ together with two [[wide subcategories]] $R_+$ and $R_-$, and a function $d\colon ob(R)\to \alpha$ called *degree*, for some [[ordinal]] $\alpha$, such that

1. every non-isomorphism in $R_+$ raises degree,

1. every non-isomorphism in $R_-$ lowers degree,

1. every isomorphism in $R$ preserves degree,

1. $R_+\cap R_-$ is the [[core]] of $R$ (equivalently, every isomorphism is in both $R_+$ and $R_-$, i.e. they are not just wide but [[pseudomonic functor|pseudomonic]] subcategories),

1. every morphism $f$ factors as a map in $R_-$ followed by a map in $R_+$, uniquely up to isomorphism, 

1. the following holds

   * for the Cisinski version of the definition:

     every morphism in $R_-$ admits a [[section]]; two such morphisms between gioven objects are equal precisely if they have the same sections.

   * for the Berger-Moerdijk version of the definition:

     if $f\in R_-$ and $\theta$ is an isomorphism such that $\theta f = f$, then $\theta = 1$ (isomorphisms see the maps in $R_-$ as [[epimorphism|epis]]).

     This last condition implies that the isomorphism in the penultimate condition must be unique.  It is not self-dual, but has an obvious dual version.  A generalized Reedy category is said to be **dualizable** if it satisfies both this condition and its dual.

For clarity, in the context of generalized Reedy categories, an ordinary [[Reedy category]] may be called a *strict Reedy category*.

### Presheaves on Reedy categories. 

For $R$ a generalized Reedy category, and $X$ a [[presheaf]] on $R$, there are the evident analog notions of $n$-cells in $X$, degenerate $n$-cells, faces, boundaries, horns, etc.

## Properties

### Normal monomorphisms
 {#NormalMorphisms}


Let $A$ be a Cisinski generalized Reedy category. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An object $a \in A$ is called _degenerate_ precisely if there is a non-isomorphism out of $a$ in $A_-$. 

=--

See ([Cisinski, prop. 8.1.9](#Cisinski)).


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every object $a \in A$ there exists a morphism $\pi : a \to b$ in $A_-$
with $b$ non-degenerate.

This is ([Cisinski, prop. 8.1.13](#Cisisnki)).

Let $X$ be a [[presheaf]] over $A$. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $a \in A$,  a cell $v \in X(a)$ is called **degenerate** precisely if
there is a morphism $\alpha : a \to a'$ in $A_-$ and a cell $u \in $

$$
  X(\alpha) : u \mapsto v
$$

See ([Cisinski, cor. 8.1.10](#Cisinski)).


Write $A/X$ for the [[category of elements]]
of $X$.



+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $a \in A$ an $a$-cell $v \in X(a)$ is called **dominant** if $(a,v) \in A/X$ has trivial [[automorphism group]].

An $a$-cell $u \in X(a)$ is called **normal** if there is a morphism $\alpha : a \to b$ in $A_-$ with $b$ non-degenerate, and a dominant $b$-cell $v \in X(b)$, such that 
$$
  X(\alpha) : v \mapsto u
  \,.
$$

The presheaf $X$ is called **normal** if all its cells are normal.

###### Proposition

$X$ is normal precisely if all its non-degenerate cells are dominant.

Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[presheaves]] over $A$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The morphism $f : X \to Y$ is called **normal** if every cell of $Y$ not in the [[image]] of $f$ is dominant.

=--

This is ([Cisinski, 8.1.30](#Cisinski)).

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Every [[monomorphism]] between normal presheaves is normal.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The class of normal monomorphisms in $PSh(A)$ is closed under

* [[retracts]];

* [[transfinite composition]];

* [[retracts]].

In fact, the class of normal monomorphisms is that generated under these operations from the boundary inclusions $I := \{\partial a \hookrightarrow a\}$.

### Model category structure on presheaves

(...)

## Examples

* Any [[Reedy category]] is a generalized Reedy category, in particular the [[simplex category]].

* Any [[groupoid]] $G$ is also a generalized Reedy category, with $G_+ = G_- = G$.

* Connes' [[category of cycles]] $\Lambda$.

* Segal's category $\Gamma$.

* The Moerdijk-Weiss [[tree category]] $\Omega$ is generalized Reedy. The degree is given by the number of vertices in a tree. 

  See also the discussion at _[[dendroidal set]]_ and _[[model structure on dendroidal sets]]_.

* Any generalized [[direct category]] or generalized [[inverse category]] is also a generalized Reedy category, in which either $R_-$ or $R_+$ consists only of the isomorphisms.
