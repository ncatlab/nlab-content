## Idea

The notion of _coinductive types_ is [[duality|dual]] to that of _[[inductive types]]_.

## Properties

### Categorical semantics

Where the [[categorical semantics]] of an [[inductive type]] is an [[initial algebra for an endofunctor]], the semantics of a coinductive type is a [[terminal coalgebra of an endofunctor]].
