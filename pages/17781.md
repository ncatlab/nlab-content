## Idea

A _pp-wave spacetime_ is a [[spacetime]] that is an exact solution to the [[Einstein equations]] for [[gravity]] and which describes empty space filled with just [[radiation]] moving through it ([[electromagnetic waves]] and/or [[gravitational waves]]) with one fixed wave vector.

Ricci flat pp-waves are examples of [[universal spacetimes]].
