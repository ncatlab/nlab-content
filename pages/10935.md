## Idea

In _([Hegel, Science of Logic, §54](Science+of+Logic#54))_ it reads:

> [[Anaxagoras]] is praised as the man who first declared that Nous, thought, is the principle of the world, that the essence of the world is to be defined as thought. In so doing he laid the foundation for an intellectual view of the universe, the pure form of which must be logic. What we are dealing with in logic is not a thinking about something which exists independently as a base for our thinking and apart from it, nor forms which are supposed to provide mere signs or distinguishing marks of truth; on the contrary, the necessary forms and self-consciousness of thought are the content and the ultimate truth itself.

In  ([Hegel, Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Vol 1]()) a similar remark is made about the ideas of [[Heraclitus]], see at _[[logos (in philosophy)]]_.
