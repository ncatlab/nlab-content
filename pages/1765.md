## Idea

A Sweedler [[coring]] is an algebraic structure that is roughly the [[duality|formal dual]] of the [[Cech nerve]] of a [[cover]].

## Definition

Let $f : R \hookrightarrow S$ be the extension of $k$-[[algebra]]s (where $k$ is a commutative unital [[ring]]). 

The corresponding __canonical coring__ or __Sweedler coring__ is the $S$-[[coring]] 

$$
  C = S\otimes_R S
$$ 

with coproduct 

$$
  \Delta : C\to C\otimes_S C \cong S\otimes_R S\otimes_R S
$$ 

given by

$$
  \Delta: s_1\otimes s_2 \mapsto s_1\otimes 1 \otimes s_2
$$ 

and counit 

$$
  \epsilon : C\to S
$$ 

given by 

$$
 \epsilon: s_1 \otimes s_2 \mapsto s_1 s_2
 \,.
$$  

### Geometric interpretation {#GeomInterpretationOfCoring}

We give a dual geometric interpretation of the Sweedler coring. 

Suppose a context of spaces and function algebras on spaces that satisfies the basic axioms of [[geometric function theory]], in that the algebra of functions $C(Y_1 \times_X Y_2)$ on a [[fiber product]] 

$$
  \array{
    Y_1 \times_X Y_2 &\to& Y_2
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_1 &\to& X
  }
$$

is the [[tensor product]] of the functions on the factors:

$$
  C(Y_1 \times_X Y_2) = C(Y_1) \otimes_{C(X)} C(Y_2)
  \,.
$$

Then let $\pi : Y \to X$ be a morphism of spaces and set

$$
  R := C(X)
$$

and

$$
  S = C(Y)
$$

and

$$
  (R \hookrightarrow S) := \pi^* : C(X) \to C(Y)
  \,.
$$

The morphism $\pi$ induces its augmented [[Cech nerve]]

$$
  \left(
     \cdots
     \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}}
     Y \times_X Y \times_X Y
     \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
     Y \times_X Y \stackrel{\to}{\to}
     Y
     \stackrel{\pi}{\to}
     X
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Taking function algebras of this yields, by the above, 

$$
  \left(
     \cdots
     \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}}}
     S \otimes_R S \otimes_R S
     \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}}
     S \otimes_R S 
     \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}
     S
     \stackrel{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}
     R
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Writing again $C = S \otimes_R S$ for the Sweedler coring, this is 

$$
  \left(
     \cdots
     \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}}}
     C \otimes_S C
     \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}}
     C 
     \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}
     S
     \stackrel{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}
     R
  \right)
  \,.
$$



## Relation to descent

The category of [[descent]] data $\mathrm{Desc}(S/R)$ for the categories of right modules along $k$-algebra extension $R\to S$ can be expressed solely in terms of the canonical coring $(C,\Delta,\epsilon)$ as the category of right $C$-[[comodule]]s.

In other words, the objects of $\mathrm{Desc}(S/R)$ are the pairs $(N,\alpha)$ where $N$ is a right $S$-[[module]], and $\alpha: N\to N\otimes_R S$ is a right $S$-module morphism and if we write $\alpha(m) = \sum_i m_i \otimes s_i$ then

* $\sum_i \alpha(m_i)\otimes s_i = \sum_i m_i\otimes 1\otimes s_i$,

* $\sum_i m_i s_i = m$.


### Geometric interpretation {#GeomInterpretationOfDescent}

Assuming again a suitable geometric context as above, we may identify a [[module]] over $R = C(X)$ with (the collection of [[section]]s of) a [[vector bundle]] (or rather a suitable generalization of that: a  [[coherent sheaf]]) over $X$. Similarly for $Y$. So we write

$$
  Vec(X) := R Mod
$$

and

$$
  Vect(Y) := S Mod
$$

for the corresponding [[category|categories]] of [[module]]s. The assignment of such categories to spaces

$$
  Vec : Z \mapsto Vec(Z)
$$

extends to a contravariant [[pseudofunctor]]

$$
  Vec : Spaces^{op} \to Cat
$$

by assigning to a morphism $f : Y \to X$ of spaces the corresponding [[functor]]

$$
  Vec(X) \simeq C(X) Mod \stackrel{- \otimes_{f} C(Y)}{\to} C(Y) Mod \simeq Vec(Y)
  \,.
$$

This way $Vec$ becomes a [[stack|prestack]] of categories on our category of spaces. 

If this prestack satisfies [[descent]] along suitable [[cover]]s, it is a [[stack]].

Geometrically this is the case if for each morphism $\pi : Y\to X$ that is regarded as a [[cover]], the category $Desc(Y,Vec)$ whose objects are tuples consisting of

* an [[object]] $a \in Vec(Y)$

* an [[isomorphism]] $g : \pi_^* a \to \pi_2^* a$

* such that 

  $$  
    \array{
       && \pi_2^* a
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\pi_{12}^* g}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{23}^* g}}
       \\
       \pi_1^* a &&\stackrel{\pi_{13}^*}{\to}&& \pi_3^*
    }
  $$

  commutes.

Morphism are defined similarly (see [[stack]] and [[descent]] for details).

To get the geometric pucture that underlies, by duality, the above comodule definition of descent, we need to reformulate this just a little bit more:

every ordinary [[vector bundle]] $E \to X$ (of finite rank) is the [[associated bundle]] $E \simeq P \times_{O(n)} V$ of an [[orthogonal group|O(n)]]-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$, and as such its [[section]]s may be identified with $O(n)$-equivariant functions $P \to V \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$ on the total space of $P$. 

Using this we may think of the $C(X)$-module of sections of $E$ as a submodule of the $C(X)$-module of all functions on $P$

$$
  \Gamma(E) \subset C(P)
  \,.
$$

We now reformulate the geometric descent for [[vector bundle]]s in terms of geometric descent for their underlying [[principal bundle]]s, and then take functions on everything in sight to obtain the comodule definition of descent that we want to describe:

A descent datum (transition function) for a [[principal bundle]] $Q \to Y$ may be thought of as the the morphism $g$ in the double [[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    &&Y\times_X Y \times_Y Q &\to& Q
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{g}}\swarrow&Y \times_X Y &\to& Y
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    Q &\to& Y &\stackrel{\pi}{\to}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

Because here $Y \times_X \times_Y \times Q$ is the space whose points consist of a point in a double overlap of the cover and a point in the fiber of $Q$ over that with respect to one patch, and the morphism identifies this with a point in the fiber of $Q$ regarded as sitting over the other patch. Analogously, there is a cocycle condition on $g$ on triple overlaps.

Now, blindly applying our functor that takes functions of spaces to the above diagram yields the double [[pushout]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    &&C(Y\times_X Y \times_Y Q) &\leftarrow& C(Q)
    \\
    &&\uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{g}^*}\nearrow&C(Y \times_X Y) &\leftarrow& C(Y)
    \\
    &&\uparrow && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\pi^*}}
    \\
    C(Q) &\leftarrow& C(Y) &\stackrel{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}& C(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

We may restrict to $N := \Gamma(E) \subset C(Q)$ as just discussed and switch to the notation from above to get

$$
  \array{
    &&N \otimes_{S} C &\leftarrow& N
    \\
    &&\uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{g}^*}\nearrow& C &\leftarrow& S
    \\
    &&\uparrow && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\pi^*}}
    \\
    N &\leftarrow& S &\stackrel{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}& R
  }
  \,.
$$

The morphism

$$
  \alpha := g^* : N \to N \otimes_S C
$$

obtained this way is the co-action morphism from the above algebraic definition. 

The further cocycle condition on $g$ similarly translates into the condition that $\alpha$ really satisfies the [[comodule]] property.


### Relation to monadic descent

This [[coring]]-formulation of [[descent]] may be understood as special case of [[monadic descent]]. See also the discussion at [[Benabou-Roubaud theorem]].

## Relation to ring extensions

Various properties of canonical coring correspond to adequate properties of the ring extension. For example, [[coseparable coring|coseparable]] Sweedler corings correspond to [[split extension]]s (the $k$-algebra extension $R\to S$ is split if there is an $R$-bimodule map $h: S\to R$ with $h(1_S) = 1_R$).
