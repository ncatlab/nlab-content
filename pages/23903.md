## Idea

A generalization of the notion of *[[concrete category]]* from [[category theory]] to [[(2,1)-category theory]]. 

##Â Definition 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __concrete (2,1)-category__ is a [[(2,1)-category]] $C$ equipped with a [[k-surjective functor|3-surjective functor]]
  
  $$
    U \colon C \to Grpd
  $$

to the [[large]] [[(2,1)-category]] [[Grpd]] of [[groupoids]]. We say a (2,1)-category $C$ is _concretizable_ if and only if it admits a 3-surjective functor $U \colon C \to Grpd$.

## Examples

* The (2,1)-category [[Grpd|$Grpd$]] of [[groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $MonGrpd$ of [[monoidal groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $BraidedMonGrpd$ of [[braided monoidal groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $SymmetricMonGrpd$ of [[symmetric monoidal groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $RingGrpd$ of [[ring groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $SymmetricRingGrpd$ of [[symmetric ring groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $2Grp$ of [[2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Smooth2Grp$ of [[smooth 2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Braided2Grp$ of [[braided 2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Symmetric2Grp$ of [[symmetric 2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category [[Cat|$Cat$]] of [[weak categories]] (with [[functors]] between these and [[natural isomorphisms]] between those) is a concrete (2,1)-category.
