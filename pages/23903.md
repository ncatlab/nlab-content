## Idea

A version of a [[concrete category]] in the setting of (2,1)-category theory. 

##Â Definition 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __concrete (2,1)-category__ is a [[(2,1)-category]] $C$ equipped with a [[k-surjective functor|3-surjective functor]]
  
  $$
    U : C \to Grpd
  $$

to the [[large]] [[(2,1)-category]] [[Grpd]]. We say a (2,1)-category $C$ is _concretizable_ if and only if it admits a 3-surjective functor $U: C \to Grpd$.

## Examples

* The (2,1)-category $Grpd$ of [[groupoids]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $2Grp$ of [[2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Smooth2Grp$ of [[smooth 2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Braided2Grp$ of [[braided 2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Symmetric2Grp$ of [[symmetric 2-groups]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.

* The (2,1)-category $Cat$ of [[weak categories]] is a concrete (2,1)-category.
