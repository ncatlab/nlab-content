## Idea

Our [[galaxy]].

> The Milky Way, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly-clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.

> ([[Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]] in *Tadhkira* 1261 AD, as translated in [Ragep 1993, p. 128](#Ragep93))
