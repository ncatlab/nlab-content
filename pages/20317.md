Our [[galaxy]].

>  Democritus $[$holds$]$ that it is the splendor which ariseth from the coalition of many small stars, which, being firmly united amongst themselves, do mutually enlighten one another.

> Δημόκριτος πολλῶν καὶ μικρῶν καὶ συνεχῶν ἀστέρων συμφωτιζομένων ἀλλήλοις συναυγασμὸν διὰ τὴν πύκνωσιν.

> ([Pseudo Plutarch](#PseudoPlutarch) ~ 400 AD, attributing to [[Democritus]] $\sim$ 400 BC -- original Greek [here](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1901Obs....24..382L#page=2))

> $\,$

> The Milky Way is made up of a very large number of small, tightly-clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.

> ([[Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]] in *Tadhkira* 1261 AD, as translated in [Ragep 1993, p. 128](#Ragep93))

> $\,$

> the Galaxy [Milky Way] is nothing else than a congeries of innumerable stars distributed in clusters. To whatever region of it you direct your spyglass, an immense number of stars immediately offer themselves to view, of which very many appear rather large and very conspicuous but the multitude of small ones is truly unfathomable.
