
The notion of {\it free crossed module} was developed by J.H.C. Whitehead to model algebraically the structure of the second relative homotopy group 
of an adjunction space $\pi_2(A \cup \{e^2_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda},A,x)$ considered as a crossed module over $\pi_1(A,x)$. 

It can also be considered as arising from the notion of a resolution for a group, by analogy with resolutions for modules, but in a nonabelian framework. So in combinatorial group theory 
we consider a presentation $\cal P= \langle X \mid R \rangle$ of a group $G$. Thus $X$ is a set of generators of the group $G$ and $R$ is a set of relators, that is, $R$ is a subset of $F(X)$, the free group on the set $X$. So we have an  epimorphism $\phi: F(X) \to G$ with kernel $N$, say, a normal subgroup of $F(X)$, and $N$ is the normal closure of $R$ in $F(X)$. All this reflect the fact that if $\phi(u)=1$, where $u \in F(X)$, then $\phi(pup^{-1})=1$ for all $p \in F(X)$. 

Write $P=F(X)$, and $\langle R\rangle^P$ for the normal closure of the set $R$ in $P$. The elements of $\langle
R\rangle^P$ are all _consequences_ of
$R$ in $P$, namely all products 

 $$ c=(r_{1}^{\epsilon _{1}})^{p_{1}} \dots (r_{m}^{\epsilon
_{m}})^{p_{m}}$$ 

where $r_{i} \in R$, $\epsilon _{i} = \pm 1$,
$p_{i} \in P$ and $m \geq 1$, and $u^p=pup^{-1}$. An important point is that if
$\phi \colon P \to Q$ is any morphism of groups  such that $\phi
(R)=\{1\} $, then $\phi (\langle R\rangle^P) =\{1\}$, since Ker $
\phi$ is normal. Thus $\phi$ factors as $P \to P/\langle R\rangle^P
\to Q$ where the first morphism is the
quotient morphism. 

It is also convenient to allow for repeated relators, which, as we shall see, corresponds to attaching several cells by the same map. So we replace the subset $R$ of $P=F(X)$ by a function $\omega: R \to P$. 

We now drop the assumption $P$ is free. We form the free $P$-group $F^P(R)$ on the set $R$: this is the free group on elements $(r,p) \in R \times P$, and has an action of the group $P$ determined  by $(r,p)^q=(r,pq)$. There is a morphism of groups $\theta:F^P(R) \to P$ given by $\theta(r,p)= (\omega(r))^p$. Then $\theta $ is a $P$-morphism: $\theta(w^p)= \theta(w)^p$ for all $w \in F^P(R), p \in P$.

We now define for $u,v \in F^P(R)$ the _Peiffer commutator_ to be the element 
$$ [\!\[ u,v]\!\] = uvu^{-1}(v^{\theta u})^{-1}.$$ Note that $\theta([\!\[ u,v]\!\] )=1 \in F^P(R)$. It may be proved that the Peiffer commutators generate a normal subgroup called the Peiffer group  of $\theta$, and written $[\!\[ F^P(R), F^P(R)]\!\] $. The quotient group $F^P(R)/ [\!\[ F^P(R),F^P(R) ]\!\] $ is written $FC(\omega)$ and there is an induced morphism

$$\delta : FC(\omega) \to P$$

with image $\langle(\omega(R))\rangle^P$. This construction is called the {\it free crossed module on $\omega: R \to P$}. The kernel of $\delta$ is actually a $P$-module, and is called the {\it module of identities among relations}.

A useful fact is that this free crossed module may also be described as the pushout in the category of crossed modules 

 $$\begin{matrix}(1 \to F(R))&\to & (1 \to P) \cr \downarrow&& \downarrow \cr (F(R) \to F(R)) &\to& (FC(\omega) \to P)\end{matrix}$$

where the morphism of groups $F(R) \to FC(\omega)$ is given by $w \mapsto [(w,1)]$, the class of $(w,1)$ in $FC(\omega)$. This shows the relevance of a Seifert-Van Kampen Theorem for second relative homotopy groups, since the above pushout comes from applying the fundamental crossed module functor $\Pi_2$ on based pairs given by 

$$\Pi_2(X,A,x)= (\delta: \pi_2(X,A,x) \to \pi_1(A,x))$$

to the  pushout of pairs of spaces defining the based pair $(A \cup \{e^2_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}, A,x)$. This theorem  also shows that we can generalise this situation to a pushout of crossed modules

 $$\matrix{(1 \to S)&\to & (1 \to P) \cr \downarrow&& \downarrow \cr (S \to S) &\to& ( M \to P)}$$

where $S$ is now any group; the crossed module $M \to P$ then gives the fundamental crossed module of the pair $(A \cup CY,A,x)$ determined by a map $f: Y \to A$ and where $S=\pi_1(Y,y)$. Note that $(A \cup CY,A)$  arises in a pushout diagram of the form 
$$\matrix{(Y,Y)&\to & (A,A) \cr \downarrow&& \downarrow \cr (CY,Y) &\to& (A \cup CY,A)}$$

This generalisation of Whitehead's theorem on free crossed modules was discovered as a consequence of the 2-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen Theorem. It has been used to give explicit computations of the crossed module $\pi_2(A \cup CY,A,x)\to \pi_1(A,x)$ in the case the map $Y \to A$ is the map of classifying spaces $BG \to BP$ induced by a morphism $\phi: G \to P$ of groups. It may also be proved that if $G,P$ are finite groups, so also is the group $M$. This gives impetus to calculations, and some of these are best done with a computer.
