## Idea

A [[conserved charge]] (under [[Noether's theorem]]) of a [[supersymmetry]]
transformation is called a _supercharge_. 

Equivalently, by [[Noether's theorem]], this is an odd symmetry generators in a [[supersymmetry]] [[super Lie algebra]].


## Examples

* The [[Dirac operator]] in [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]].

* The [[Dirac-Ramond operator]] on the [[superstring]].

## Related concepts
