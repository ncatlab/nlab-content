## Idea

A _proof assistant_ or _proof management system_ is a kind of [[programming language]] designed to help with [[proofs]] in formalized [[mathematics]].

There are two threads of current development in proof systems: foundational and coverage. The foundational work tries to find the best meta-theory to formalize mathematics. Out of that work first came dependent types ([[Automath]], in the late 60s), then the [[calculus of constructions]] (early [[Coq]]), and the [[calculus of inductive constructions]] (current [[Coq]]). More recently a new wave of such work is being done in [[homotopy type theory]] as another step in this direction. Coq's library is not that large, except in the area of [[group theory]] where the results of the work on [[Feit-Thompson theorem]] has produce something larger.

The much larger work has happened for decades building [[Mizar]]'s enormous library (Mizar is based on Tarski-Grothendieck set theory rather than type theory). Its library is a couple of orders of magnitude larger than anyone else's. Also worth a close look is [[NuPRL]], HOL light and [[Isabelle]], which all have decently sized libraries.
