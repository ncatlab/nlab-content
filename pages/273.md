#Idea#

The notion of [[cohomology]] finds its natural general formulationn in terms of [[hom-space]]s in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]], as described at [[cohomology]]. Much of the cohomologies which have been traditionally considered, such as [[abelian sheaf cohomology|sheaf cohomology]] turn out to be just a special case of the general situation, for objects which are sufficiently abelian in the sense of [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]].

Therefore to amplify that one is looking at general [[cohomology]] without restricting to [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian cohomology]] one sometimes speaks of  **nonabelian cohomology**. 

#History#

It was originally apparently John Roberts who understood (remarkably: while thinking about quantum field theory in the guise of [[AQFT]]) that general cohomology is about coloring simplices in $\infty$-categories.  

* John E. Roberts, _Mathematical Aspects of Local Cohomology_
talk at Colloqium on Operator Algebras and their Applications to Mathematical Physics, Marseille 20-24 June, 1977 .

This is recounted for instance by Ross Street in

* Ross Street, _Categorical and combinatorial aspects of descent theory_ ([pdf](http://arxiv.org/ftp/math/papers/0303/0303175.pdf))

and 

* Ross Street, _An australian conspectus on higher categories_ ([pdf](http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/Minneapolis.pdf)).

Parallel to this development of the notion of [[descent|descent and codescent]] there was the development of [[homotopical cohomology theory]] as described in

* Kenneth S. Brown, _Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology_, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 186 (1973), 419-458 ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schreiber/Abstract%20homotopy%20theory%20and%20generalized%20sheaf%20cohomology.pdf))

Both approaches are different, but closely related. Their relation is via the notion of [[descent|codescent]].

There is a chain of inclusions

$$
  AbelianGroups \hookrightarrow
  ChainComplexesOfAbelianGroups
  \hookrightarrow
  CrossedComplexes

  \omega Groupoids

  \omega Categories
$$

along which one can generalize the coefficient objects of ordinary cohomology. (See [[strict omega-groupoid]], [[strict omega-category]]). Since doing so in particular generalizes abelian groups to nonabelian groups (but goes much further!) this is generally addressed as leading to _nonabelian cohomology_.

Depending on how one thinks of the object whose cohomology one computes, there are two different ways to realize this, as mentioned above:

* [[nonabelian sheaf cohomology]] in terms of [[descent]] for $\omega$-category valued presheaves, i.e. in terms of [[infinity-stack|infinity-stacks]];

* in terms of [[homotopical cohomology theory]] which realizes [[nonabelian cocycle|cocycles]] as $\omega$-[[anafunctor|anafunctors]].

Either way, one obtaines a notion of _cohomology on $\infty$-categories with coefficients in $\infty$-catgories_. This is, most generally, the setup of "[[nonabelian cohomology]]".

This is conceptually best understood today in terms of [[Higher Topos Theory|higher topos theory]], using [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-categories of (infinity,1)-sheaves]]. 

This perspective on nonabelian cohomology is discussed for instance in

* Bertrand To&euml;en, _Non-abelian cohomology_ ([slides](http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2002/introstacks/toen/1/index.html) [ps](http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2002/introstacks/toen/1/meta/aux/toen.ps))


#Nonabelian group cohomology#

Sometimes the term _nonabelian cohomology_ is used in a more restrictive sense. Often people mean "nonabelian _group_ cohomology" when they say nonabelian cohomology, hence restricting to the domains to [[group|groups]], which are [[groupoid|groupoids]] with a single object.

This kind of nonabelian cohomology is discussed for instance in

* John C. Baez, Michael Shulman, _Lectures on $n$-Categories and Cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420)).

That and how ordinary group cohomology is reproduced from the [[homotopical cohomology theory]] of [[strict omega-groupoid|strict omega-groupoids]] is discussed in detail in 

* R. Brown, P. Higgins, R. Sivera, [[nonabelian algebraic topology|Nonabelian algebraic topology]].

#Objects classified by nonabelian cohomology#

For $g : X \to A$ a cocycle in nonabelian cohomology, we say the [[fibration sequence|homotopy fibers]] of $g$ is the object _classified_ by $g$.
