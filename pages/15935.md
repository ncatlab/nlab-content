## Idea

An _anti-reduced object_ is one whose [[reduced object|reduction]] is the point, hence one consisting entirely of "[[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] extension", i.e. an [[infinitesimally thickened point]].

## Definition

In the context of [[differential cohesion]], an anti-reduced obect is an [[anti-modal type]] $X$ for the [[reduction modality]] $\Re$

$$
  \Re(X) \simeq \ast
  \,.
$$

## Examples

### Formal moduli problems

In [[homotopy type theory]]/[[higher topos theory]] anti-reduced types are essentially what is also called "[[formal moduli problems]]" (these are typically required to satisfy one more condition besides being anti-reduced, namely being [[cohesive (∞,1)-presheaf on E-∞ rings|infinitesimally cohesive]] in the sense of Lurie).
