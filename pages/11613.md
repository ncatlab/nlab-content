## Idea

A _[[domain specific programming language]]_ is one designed for  a specialized "domain" of applications. A _domain specific embedded programming language_ (DSEL) is a domain specific language realized "inside" a general-purpose high level ([[type theory|typed]]) [[programming language]].

## {#RelationToSyntheticMathematics} Relation to synthetic mathematics
 
 
There is at least some similarity between DSELs and [[synthetic mathematics]], see for instance ([Hudak 89, section 3.2](#Hudak89)). In ([Hudak 89, figure 2](#Hudak89)) this shows aspects of a real-world DSL for "geometric region analysis" embedded in [[Haskell]] which under the [[relation between type theory and category theory]]/[[computational trinitarianism]] one immediately recognizes as a fragment of [[synthetic geometry]].
