
##Definition##

The Hilbert cube is the [[Tychonoff product|topological product]]

$$\prod_n [0,\frac{1}{n}]\cong\prod_n [-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n}] $$

It is a [[compactum|compact]] [[metric space]].  It is variously denoted by $Q$ or $I^\omega$.


It plays a central role in [[Borsuk's shape theory]], and is the basis for the construction of Hilbert cube manifolds.  The theory of these were developed by Tom Chapman (mid 1970s) and were used in his proof of the topological invariance of Whitehead torsion.


##Pseudo-interior of $Q$##
It has an important subspace known as its _pseudo-interior_.  This is the product of the corresponding open intervals,

$$s= \prod_n (-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n}).$$

This plays an essential role in the [[shape theory|Chapman complement theorem]].
