## Idea

A [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is a _hyperbolic manifold_ of constant [[sectional curvature]] $-1$.

## Properties

### Relation to Chern-Simons theory

There is a curious relation of [[volumes]] of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to the [[action functional]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]]/[[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]].

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] and $\mathbf{c} \colon \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$ a [[cocycle]] in degree-3 (generalized) [[Lie group cohomology]]. Write $\flat G$ for the underlying [[discrete group]] and $\flat \mathbf{c} \colon \mathbf{B} \flat G \to \mathbf{B}^3 \flat U(1)$ for the induced [[cocycle]] in ordinary (discrete) [[group cohomology]], $[\flat \mathbf{c}] \in H^3_{Grp}(G_{disc},U(1)_{disc})$.

Then for $\Sigma$ a [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 3, a map (of [[smooth infinity-groupoids]]) $\Sigma \to \mathbf{B}\flat G$ is a [[flat connection|flat]] $G$-[[principal connection]] on $\Sigma$ and the composite

$$
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}\flat G]
  \stackrel{[\Sigma, \flat \mathbf{c}]}{\to}
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^3 \flat U(1)]
  \stackrel{\int_{\Sigma}}{\to}
  U(1)
$$

is the [[action functional]] for $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] on $\Sigma$ restricted to $G$-[[flat connections]], or equivalently is the action functional of $\flat G$-[[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]].

Now for $G = SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ the complex [[special linear group]] and hence for [[Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group]], it turns out that this flat Chern-Simons/Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant of 3-manifolds always has an expression as a combination of volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

For $n = 2$ this is well understood conceptually. For $n \geq 3$ it has been checked by the [[computer algebra]] system [SnapPy](http://scienceblogs.de/mathlog/2010/02/24/snappy/) ([Zickert 07](#Zickert07)), but the conceptual reason remains unclear.

## Properties

### Mostow rigidity theorem

The [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] states that every [[hyperbolic manifold]] of [[dimension]] $\geq 3$ and of [[finite number|finite]] [[volume]] is uniquely determined by its [[fundamental group]].
