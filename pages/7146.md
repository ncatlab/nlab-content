## Idea

A _monad_ in the sense of Beilinson is a [[chain complex]] whose [[chain homology]] is concentrated in degree 0. (For instance p. 21 [here](#ES)).
In other words, it is a certain [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]] in the context of [[homological algebra]].

(This is unrelated to [[monad (disambiguation)|other notions of monads]]).
