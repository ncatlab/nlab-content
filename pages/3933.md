A **sequential (co)limit** is a [[limit]]/[[colimit]] whose [[diagram]] category is an [[ordinal]] or its [[opposite poset|opposite]] (regarded as a [[poset]], regarded as a [[category]]).  Sometimes the term is used even more specifically for a (co)limit over the ordinal $\omega$.

Thus, a sequential limit is a special case of a [[directed limit]]. See there for more details.
