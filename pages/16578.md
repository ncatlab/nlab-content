In [[Esquisse d'un programme]], [[Grothendieck]] refers to the [[group]]

$$\mathcal{C}_2 = \langle\sigma_0,\sigma_1,\sigma_2 \mid \sigma_0^2 = \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = (\sigma_0\sigma_2)^2 = 1\rangle$$

as the **cartographic group** (of dimension 2), and to its [[index of a subgroup|index]] 2 [[subgroup]]

$$\mathcal{C}_2^+ = \langle\rho_0,\rho_1,\rho_2 \mid \rho_1^2 = \rho_0\rho_1\rho_2 = 1\rangle$$

as the **oriented cartographic group**.  [[transitive action|Transitive]] [[permutation representations]] (or equivalently, [[conjugacy class]]es of transitive subgroups) of $\mathcal{C}_2^+$ can be identified with [[topological maps]] on connected, oriented surfaces without boundary, while more generally, transitive permutation representations of $\mathcal{C}_2$ can be identified with maps on connected surfaces which may be non-orientable or with boundary.

## Higher dimensions

The $n$-dimensional analogue of the cartographic group is the [[Coxeter group]]

$$\mathcal{C}_n = \langle\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_n \mid \sigma_i^2 = (\sigma_i\sigma_j)^2 = 1, (|i-j|\gt 1)\rangle.$$
