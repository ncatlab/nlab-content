## Idea ##

In a [[model category]] fibrations enjoy [[pullback stability]] and cofibrations are stable under [[pushout]], but weak equivalences need not have either property. In a proper model category weak equivalences are also preserved under certain pullbacks and/or certain pushouts.



## Definition ##

A [[model category]] is called 

* **right proper** if weak equivalences are preserved by [[pullback]] along fibrations

* **left proper** if weak equivalence are preserved by [[pushout]] along cofibrations

* **proper** if it is both left and right proper.


So a model category is right proper if for every weak equivalence $f : A \to B$ in $W\subset Mor(C)$ and every fibration $h : C \to B$ the pullback $h^* f : A \times_B C \to C$ in

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C B &\to& A
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Rightarrow h^* f \in W}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \in W}}
    \\
    C &\stackrel{h \in F}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a weak equivalence.

## Examples ##


### Left proper model categories

* the left [[Bousfield localization]] of every left proper [[combinatorial model category]] at a set of morphisms is again left proper.

* every full subcategory on cofibrant objects

### Right proper model categories ###


* every [[category of fibrant objects]] is right proper

### Proper model categories ###

* [[Top]]: [[model structure on topological spaces]]

* [[SSet]]: [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

All [[model category|model categories]] that model aspects of [[infinity-stack]]s and hence of [[cohomology]] are right proper: 

* [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

  for presheaves over the point this restricts to:

  * [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

  * [[model structure on topological spaces]]



* [[model structure on presheaves of spectra]] 

  for presheaves over the point this restricts to:

  * [[model structure on spectra]]

###### Lemma


In a left proper model category, ordinary [[pushout]]s along cofibrations are [[homotopy pushout]]s.

Dually, in a right proper model category, ordinary [[pullback]]s along fibrations are [[homotopy pullback]]s.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is stated for instance in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop A.2.4.4]] or in prop. 1.19 in
[Bar](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~clarkbar/complete.pdf). We follow the proof given in this latter reference.

We demonstrate the first statement, the second is its direct formal dual.

So consider a [[pushout]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    K &\to& Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} && \downarrow
    \\
    L &\to& X
  }
$$

in a left proper model category, where the morphism $K \to L$ is a cofibration, as indicated. We need to exhibit a weak equivalence $X' \stackrel{}{\to} X$ from an object $X'$ that is manifestly a [[homotopy pushout]] of $L \leftarrow K \to Y$.

The standard procedure to produce this $X'$ is to pass to a weakly equivalent diagram with the property that all objects are cofibrant and one of the morphisms is a cofibration. The ordinary pushout of that diagram is well known to be the [[homotopy pushout]], as described there.

So pick a cofibrant replacement $\emptyset \hookrightarrow K' \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}$ of $K$ and factor $K' \to K \to Y$ as a cofibration followed by a weak equivalence
$K' \hookrightarrow Y' \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Y$ and similarly factor $K' \to K \to L$ as $K' \hookrightarrow L' \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} L$

This yields a weak equivalence of  diagrams

$$
  \array{
    Y &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& Y'
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}}
    \\
    K &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& K'
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}}
    \\
    L &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& L'    
  }
  \,,
$$

where now the diagram on the right is cofibrant as a diagram, so that its ordinary pushout

$$
  X' := L' \coprod_{K'} Y'
$$

is a homotopy colimit of the original diagram. To obtain the weak equivalence from there to $X$, first form the further pushouts

$$
  \array{
    K &&&\to&&& Y
    \\
    & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} 
     &&&& \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}} & 
    \\
    && K' &\to& Y' &&  
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} 
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} && \downarrow
    \\
    && L' &\to& X' && 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\in W}}
    \swarrow &&&& \searrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} & 
    \\
    L'':= K \coprod_{K'} L 
    &&&\to&&& 
    L'' \coprod_{K} Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} &&&&&&  \downarrow
    \\
    L &&&\to&&& X
  }
  \,,
$$

where the total outer diagram is the original pushout diagram. Here the cofibrations are as indicated by the above factorization and by their stability under pushouts, and the weak equivalences are as indicated by the above factorization and by the left properness of the model category. The weak equivalence $L'' \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} L$ is by the [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3 property]].

This establishes in particular a weak equivalence

$$
  X' \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} L'' \coprod_K Y
  \,.
$$

It remains to get a weak equivalence further to $X$.
For that, take the two outer squares from the above

$$
  \array{
    K &\to& Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} && \downarrow
    \\
    L'' &\to& L'' \coprod_{K'} Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} && \downarrow
    \\
    L &\to& X
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that the top square is a pushout by construction, and the total one by assumption.  Therefore by the general theorem about pastings of [[pushout]]s, also the lower square is a pushout.

Then factor $K \to Y$ as a cofibration followed by a weak equivalence $K \hookrightarrow Z \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Y$
and push that factorization through the double diagram, to obtain

$$
  \array{
    K &\stackrel{\in cof}{\to}& Z &\stackrel{\in W}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in \cof}} 
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} && \downarrow
    \\
    L'' &\stackrel{\in cof}{\to}& 
    L'' \coprod_{K} Z
    &\stackrel{\in W}{\to}&
    L'' \coprod_{K'} Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    && \downarrow
    \\
    L & \to& L \coprod_K Z &\stackrel{\in W}{\to}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

Again by the behaviour of pushouts under pasting, every single square and composite rectangle in this diagram is a pushout. Using this, the cofibration and weak equivalence properties from before push through the diagram as indicated. This finally yields the desired weak equivalence

$$
  L'' \coprod_{K'} Y \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  X
$$

by [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]].

=--



If we had allowed ourselved to assume in addition that $K$ itself is already cofibrant, then the above statement has a much simpler proof, which we list just for fun, too.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the above assuming that the domain of the cofibration is cofibrant 


Let $A \hookrightarrow B$ be a cofibration with $A$ cofibrant and let $A \to C$ be any other morphism. Factor this morphism as
$A \hookrightarrow C' \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} C$ by a cofibration
followed by an acyclic fibration. This give a weak equivalence
of pushout diagrams

$$
  \array{
    C' &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& C
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{=}{\to}& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\stackrel{=}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

In the diagram on the left all objects are cofibrant and one morphism is a cofibration,
hence this is a cofibrant diagram and its ordinary colimit is the homotopy colimit.
Using that [[pushout]] diagrams compose to pushout diagrams, that cofibrations are preserved under pushout and that in a left proper model category weak equivalences
are preserved under pushout along cofibrations, we find a weak equiovalence
$hocolim \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B \coprod_A C$

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{\in cof}{\to}& C' &\stackrel{\in W \cap fib}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}} &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in cof}}
    \\
    B &\to& hocolim &\stackrel{\in W}{\to}&
    B \coprod_A C
  }
  \,.
$$

The proof for the second statement is the precise formal dual.
