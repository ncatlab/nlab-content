## Idea

It is often easier to study formal group schemes using the associated Dieudonne module.



## Definition

A *Dieudonné module* is defined to be a [[module]] over the [[Dieudonné ring]].

If $G$ is an [[affine scheme|affine]] [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[unitary]] [[group scheme]] over $k$ we construct (in [Proposition (codir)](#thmcodir)) a codirected diagram of Dieudonné modules to associate to $G$ a Dieudonné module $\displaystyle M(G)=\lim Hom(G, W_n(k))$.

This construction can be executed similarly in the [[ind-object|Ind category]] so we have Dieudonné modules for [[formal group]] schemes and [[p-divisible groups]].

###### Proposition (codir){#thmcodir}
Let $k$ be a perfect field of prime characteristic $p$. Let $\underline W$ be the codirected diagram

$$W_{1k}\stackrel{T}{\to}W_{2k}\stackrel{T}{\to}W_{3k}\stackrel{T}{\to}\dots$$

where the $W_{lk}\in Acu_k$ are [[unipotent group schemes]] and $T:\begin{cases}W_{nk}\to W_{n+1}k
\\
(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})\mapsto (0,x_0,x_1,\dots, x_{n-1})\end{cases}$ denotes the translation. By

$$*:\begin{cases}
W_k\times W_{nR}\to W_{nR}
\\
(a,w)\mapsto a^{p^{1-n}} R\cdot w
\end{cases}$$

$W_{nR}=W_R/T^n W_R$ becomes a $W_k$-module.

###### Theorem
([III.5](#Demazure), $Acu_k\simeq Tor_V D_kMod$)

(see also [[group scheme]] for more context concerning this theorem)

Let $k$ be a [[perfect field]] of prime characteristic $p$. Since $k$ is perfect Frobenius is an automorphism.

On the left we have the category of [[affine scheme|affine]] commutative [[unipotent group scheme|unipotent group schemes]]. On the right we have the category of all [[Dieudonné ring|D_k]][[Dieudonné module|-modules]] of $V$-torsion. The (contravariant) equivalence is given by

$$M:\begin{cases}
Acu_k&\to& Tor_V D_kMod
\\
G&\mapsto&colim_n Acu_k(G,W_{nk})
\end{cases}$$

where we recall that $W_n:=coker( T^n:W_k\to W_k)$ where $T:\begin{cases}W_k\to W_k
\\
(x_0,x_1,\dots)\mapsto (0,x_0,x_1,\dots)\end{cases}$ is the endomorphism of the [[Witt group]] called *translation* and $T^n$ is the translation iterated $n$-times and $W_n$ is called the *group of [[Witt vectors]] of length $n$*.

By the above proposition $W_{nR}$ is a $W_k$-module.

## Properties

Since all the $V$ operators are are monomorphisms, we get that $Hom(G, W_n(k))\to Hom(G, W_{n+1}(k))$ are all injective and hence we can identify $Hom(G, W_n(k))$ with a submodule of $D(G)$ or explicitly we know that $Hom(G, W_n(k))=\{m \in D(G): V^n(m)=0\}$. Thus every element of $D(G)$ is killed by a power of $V$. 

If we introduce a bit of abstraction we can see the beauty of all this. Let $D=\Lambda\{F, V\}$ be the noncommutative polynomial ring over the Witt vectors on two indeterminates that satisfy the commutation laws $Fw=w^p F$, $w^p V=Vw$, and $FV=VF=p$. This is called the [[Dieudonne ring]]. We have a canonical way to consider $D(G)$ as a left $D$-module. Thus $G\mapsto D(G)$ is a [[contravariant functor]] from affine unitary group schemes to the category of $D$-[[module]]s with $V$ torsion. This turns out to be an [[equivalence of categories|anti-equivalence]] of categories.
