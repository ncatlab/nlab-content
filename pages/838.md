A $2$-[[2-category|category]] $C$ is __locally posetal__ if every [[hom-category]] $C(x,y)$ is a [[poset]].

Locally posetal $2$-categories are the same as $2$-[[2-poset|posets]].  Just as the motivating example of a $2$-category is the $2$-category [[Cat]] of categories, so the motivating example of a $2$-poset is the $2$-poset [[Pos]] of posets.  If you interpret $\Pos$ as a [[full subcategory|full sub-2-category]] of $\Cat$, then it is indeed locally posetal.
