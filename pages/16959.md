###### Definition

Write $I \coloneqq [0,1]$ for the unit interval, regarded as a [[topological space]].

For $X,Y $ two [[topological spaces]], the [[join]] $X \ast Y$ is the [[quotient space]] 

$$
   X \ast Y \coloneqq (X \times I \times Y)_{/\sim}
$$

of the [[product space]] $X \times I \times Y$ by the [[equivalence relation]]

$$
  (x, 0, y_1) \simeq (x,0,y_2) \;\;,\;\; (x_1,1,y) \sim (x_2, 1, y)
  \,.
$$

In other words, the join is the pushout in [[Top]] of the diagram 

$$\array{
 & & X \times Y & & & & X \times Y & & \\
 & \mathllap{\pi_1} \swarrow & & \searrow \mathrlap{i_0} & & \mathllap{i_1} & & \searrow \mathrlap{\pi_2} & \\ 
X & & & & X \times I \times Y & & & & Y
}$$ 

where $i_0$ is the inclusion $(x, y) \mapsto (x, 0, y)$, and $i_1$ is the inclusion $(x, y) \mapsto (x, 1, y)$. 

Intuitively, $X \ast Y$ is the union of all line segments connecting $X$ to $Y$ when these are placed in general position in an ambient [[Euclidean space]]. 

The join is [[monoidal category|associative]]; intuitively, a join of three spaces $X, Y, Z$ is the union of 2-[[simplices]] whose vertices lie in $X, Y, Z$ respectively when these are placed in general position. Thus the join endows $Top$ with a [[monoidal category]] structure whose unit is the empty space. 

## Examples 

Special cases include the [[cone]] of a space, and the calculation $S^m \ast S^n \cong S^{m+n+1}$ when these spheres are placed in general position.

###### Example 
For $X = S^1, Y = S_1$, we may consider $X$ to consist of [[quaternions]] $a + b i$ and $Y$ to consist of quaternions $c j + d k$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = 1 = c^2 + d^2$. Then $X$ and $Y$ are in general position in $\mathbb{H} \cong \mathbb{R}^4$ with respect to each other, and the quotient map 

$$X \times I \times Y \to S^3$$ 

$$\,$$

$$(a + b i, t, c + d i) \mapsto t^{1/2}(a + b i) + (1 - t)^{1/2}(c + d i)$$ 

is an explicit realization of the unit sphere $S^3$ as $X \ast Y$.

###### Example 
For a topological group $G$, the [[Milnor construction]] of the total space $E G$ of the [[classifying space|classifying bundle]] is an iterated join, i.e., the colimit of a diagram of inclusions 

$$G \to G \ast G \to G \ast G \ast G \to \ldots$$ 

where the identity element of $G$ is used to embed each $G^{\ast n}$ into its successor $G^{\ast (n+1)}$. The idea is that passing to higher joins kills off more and more lower-dimensional [[homotopy groups]], until one reaches the colimit which is then weakly contractible. 

The same idea applies to a general space $X$; an $H$-space structure and higher homotopy associativities (collectively embodied in a structure of algebra over the [[associahedron|Stasheff operad]]) may be used to build a classifying bundle in iterative fashion, with the [[Hopf construction]] giving the first stage of the iteration.
