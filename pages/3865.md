#Idea
This page is about unbounded operators on Hilbert spaces. Considering operators on Hilbert spaces, bounded and continous is synonymous, so the first question to be answered is: Why consider unbounded, that is not continuous operators in a category that is a subcategory of [[Top]]? The reason is simple: It is forced upon us by both applications, like [[quantum mechanics]], and the fact that simple and useful operators like differentiation are not bounded. But in most applications the operators considered retain some sort of "limit property", namely the property of being "closed". Although that seems to be negligible compared to continuity, it allows the development of a rich and useful theory, and as a consequence there is a tremendous amount of literature devoted to this subject. 
  
##why differentiation is not bounded
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and T be the operator of differentiation, that is for $f$ differentiable we have $Tf(x) := f'(x)$. Consider the sequence $f_k(x) := \exp(-k|x|)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then we have $\frac{\|Tf_k\|}{\|f_k\|} = k$. This example also shows that unbounded operators will not be defined on the whole Hilbert space, but on a (dense) subset.

#domains
Unbounded operators are not defined on the whole Hilbert space, so it is essential that, when talking about a specific unbounded operator, we are actually talking about the tuple $(T, D_T)$ of an operator $T$ and it's domain $D_T$. The domain of a linear operator is always a linear submanifold of the Hilbert space. Unless stated otherwise we will always assume that the domain is dense.

The default definition of the domain of a given operator $T$ is simply $D_T := \{x \in \mathcal{H} \vert Tx \in \mathcal{H} \}$.

#closedness and selfadjointness

##closedness
Recall that the graph of an operator T (or any function, in general) is the subset $\mathcal{G}_T := \{(x, y) \in \mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H} \vert Tx = y \}$. The graph of a given operator need not be closed (in the product topology of $\mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H}$). The notion that will be the supplement of continuity is "closable" defined as follows:

* definition (extension): Given an operator T with domain $D_T$, any operator $T'$ with larger domain that is equal to $T$ on $D_T$ is called an **extension** of T.

* definition (closed): An operator is **closed** if it's graph is closed.

* definition (closeable): An operator is **closable** if it has a closed extension. The smallest such extension is called the **closure** of $T$ and is denoted by $\overline{T}$.

* proposition (closure of graph is graph of closure): If an operator $T$ is closable then the closure of it's graph $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ is the graph of an operator, and this operator is it's closure.

The last part deserves some elaboration: Given an operator $T$, we can always form the closure of it's graph $\mathcal{G}$. How can the closure not be the graph of an operator? Given a convergent sequence $(x_n)$ in $\mathcal{G}$, setting $(\lim_{n \to \infinity} x_n =:x$ and $(\lim_{n \to \infinity} Tx_n =:y$ we have that $(x, y)$ is in the closure of $\mathcal{G}$. Now it may happen that there is another point $(x, y')$ in the closure with $y \neq y'$, which implies that the closure cannot be the graph of a single valued function.

#selfadjointness
We let $T^*$ be the adjoint of an operator $T$. Note that for an only densly defined $T$, the domain of the adjoint may be strictly larger.

* definition (selfadjoint et alt.): An operator is **symmetric** (or **Hermitian**) if $T = T^* \vert_{D_T}$ (the adjoint is restricted to the domain of $T$). It is **selfadjoint** if it is symmetric and $D_T = D_{T^*}$.

##example of a symmetric, but not selfadjoint, operator
The difference of being symmetric and being selfadjoint is crucial, although there is a famous anecdote that seems to indicate otherwise:

* anecdote of selfadjointness: Once upon a time John von Neumann thanked Werner Heisenberg for the invention of [[quantum mechanics]], because this had led to the development of so much beautiful mathematics, adding that mathematics paid back a part of the debt by clarifying for example the difference of symmetry and selfadjointness. Heisenberg replied: "What is the difference?".
