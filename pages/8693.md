## Definition

For $A$ an [[abelian group]] and $(a,b) \in A \times A$ a pair of [[elements]], their **difference** is the element 

$$
 b - a \coloneqq b + a^{-1} \in A
 \,.
$$

This is often considerd for the case that $A$ is the abelian group underlying a [[vector space]] $V$, which which case one typically denotes the elements instead as $(\vec x, \vec y) \in V \times V$ and their difference as

$$
  \vec y - \vec x \in V
  \,.
$$

Specifically if $V = \mathbb{R}$ is the [[real line]] or the [[rational numbers]] of just the [[integers]], one just writes $y-x$. Etc.
