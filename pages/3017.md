## Idea

For large classes of examples of [[bicategory|bicategories]] the [[k-morphism|1-morphisms]] naturally are of one of two different types:

1. special morphisms that may be taken to compose strictly among themselves;

1. more general morphisms that behave like [[bimodule]]s.

The archetypical example is indeed the [[bicategory]] whose objects are [[algebra]]s, and whose 1-morphisms are [[bimodule]]s between these: every ordinary algebra homomorphism $f : A \to B$ induces an $A$-$B$-bimodule ${}_f B$ and this operation induces a 2-functor from the [[category]] of algebras and algebra homomorphisms into the [[bicategory]] of algebras and bimodules, which is the identity on objects. 

For usefully working with bicategories of this kind, it is typically of crucial importance to remember this extra information. A _framing_ on a bicategory is a way to encode this.

This is essentially the same as a _[[proarrow equipment]]_ on a [[bicategory]]. See there for more.
