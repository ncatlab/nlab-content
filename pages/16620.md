## Definition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and $x \in X$ a point. A _neighborhood base_ at $x$ is a collection $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of [[neighbourhoods]] of $x$ such that every [[neighborhood]] $W$ of $x$ (which WLOG we may assume open) contains some $U_i$:

$$
  \underset{ { W \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} X } \atop { W \supset \{x\} }   }{\forall}
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\exists}
    \left(
       U_i \subset W
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$
