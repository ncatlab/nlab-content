## Definition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. We say that a point $x \in X$ has a _neighborhood base_ at $x$ if there is a collection $\{U^x_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of [[open neighbourhoods]] of $x$ such that every [[neighborhood]] $W^x$ of $x$ contains some $U^x_i$:

$$
  \underset{ { W^x \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} X } \atop { W \supset \{x\} }   }{\forall}
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\exists}
    \left(
       U^x_i \subset W^x
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$
