An **order** on a set $S$ is a binary [[relation]] that is, at the very least, [[transitive relation|transitive]].

Actually, there are several different notions of order that are each useful in their own ways:
* [[direction]]
* [[linear order]]
* [[partial order]]
* [[preorder]]
* [[quasiorder]]
* [[total order]]
* [[well-order]]
