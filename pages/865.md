An **order** on a set $S$ is (usually) a binary [[relation]] that is, at the very least, [[transitive relation|transitive]].

Actually, there are several different notions of order that are each useful in their own ways:
* [[direction]]
* [[linear order]]
* [[partial order]]
* [[preorder]]
* [[quasiorder]]
* [[total order]]
* [[well-order]]

The closely related notion of a [[cyclic order]] is not actually a binary relation but a ternary relation.

The study of orders is [[order theory]].
