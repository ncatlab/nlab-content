## Idea

In [[solid state physics]], where the nature of [[quantum materials]] depends crucially on the [[entanglement]] of their [[ground states]], 
it has been proposed ([Kitaev 11](#Kitaev11), [13](#Kitaev13)) that "*short-range entanglement*" (SRE) in a quantum material means or implies that the "ground state is non-degenerate", hence that the [[Hilbert space]] of [[quantum states]] with the same lowest [[energy]] has [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] $1$. See also [Chen, Gu & Wen 10, Sec. II](#ChenGuWen2010).

If such an SRE material is in a [[topological phase of matter]], with the ground state separated by an [[energy]] gap from the excited states, then this means ([Freed 14](#Freed14), cf. [G & JF 19](#GJF19), [ftn 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07950.pdf#page=4)) that the ([[extended topological field theory|extended]]) [[topological field theory]] which describes the [[topological phase of matter|topological phase]] is an *[[invertible topological field theory]]*, hence one also speaks of an *invertible topological phase*.

In particular, short-range entanglement thus implies the *absence* of "[[topological order]]" (at least by two of three common definitions of the latter, see [there](topological+order#RelationBetweenDefiningConditions)).

In contrast, *[[long-range entanglement]]* in the ground state is supposedly the hallmark of [[topological order]] ([Chen, Gu & Wen 10, Sec. V](#ChenGuWen2010))
