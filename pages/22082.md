## Idea

[[categorification|Categorification]] is a creative nonmechanical process in which categorical structures are promoted to $n$-categorical structures, for some $n\ge 2$.

(∞,1)-categorification is a special instance of this idea, in which the newly created $n$-morphisms are invertible for all $n\ge 2$.

The phrase [[higher structures]] also refers primarily to (∞,1)-categorification.

Sometimes more than one (∞,1)-categorification is possible,
as is the case for [[abelian groups]],
which can be categorified to [[module spectra|$\mathrm{H}\mathbb{Z}$-module spectra]] (as represented by [[simplicial abelian groups]]) or [[connective spectra]].

In addition to this creative choice of a [[Platonic form]] categorifying a given structure, another creative aspect is a choice of a specifc [[homotopy theory FAQ|model]] for the resulting object,
e.g., [[(∞,1)-categories]] can be modeled by [[relative categories]], [[simplicial categories]], [[quasicategories]], etc.

## Animation

In some cases, there is an automatic (∞,1)-categorification. For example, the [[animation]] $\mathrm{Ani}(C)$ of a cocomplete category $C$ that is generated under colimits by its subcategory $C^{\mathrm{sfp}}$ of compact projective objects, is the (∞,1)-category freely generated by $C^{sfp}$ under sifted colimits. (See Kęstutis Česnavičius and Peter Scholze, Sec. 5.1.4.)

For example, the animation of the 1-category of modules over an ordinary [[ring]] $R$ is the (∞,1)-category of [[module spectra]] over the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg-MacLane ring spectrum]] $\mathrm{H}R$.

## Further Examples

In the table below, structures on the left are always understood up to an isomorphism, whereas on the right we explicitly indicate the notion of a weak equivalence used (except for [[Platonic forms]] such as [[(∞,1)-categories]]).
