## Idea

[[categorification|Categorification]] is a creative nonmechanical process in which categorical structures are promoted to $n$-categorical structures, for some $n\ge 2$.

(∞,1)-categorification is a special instance of this idea, in which the newly created $n$-morphisms are invertible for all $n\ge 2$.

The phrase [[higher structures]] also refers primarily to (∞,1)-categorification.

Sometimes more than one (∞,1)-categorification is possible,
as is the case for [[abelian groups]],
which can be categorified to [[module spectra|$\mathrm{H}\mathbb{Z}$-module spectra]] (as represented by [[simplicial abelian groups]]) or [[connective spectra]].

In addition to this creative choice of a [[Platonic form]] categorifying a given structure, another creative aspect is a choice of a specifc [[homotopy theory FAQ|model]] for the resulting object,
e.g., [[(∞,1)-categories]] can be modeled by [[relative categories]], [[simplicial categories]], [[quasicategories]], etc.

## Simplicial objects

For [[algebras over an algebraic theory]] $T$,
one can construct an (∞,1)-categorification
by passing to [[simplicial objects]] valued in algebras over $T$,
and equipping them with weak equivalences
induced by the forgetful functor to simplicial sets.

In some cases, the result can be different from the result of the animation
procedure described below, e.g., for the algebraic theory that
defines commutative monoids
we get commutative simplicial monoids, equivalently,
[[E-infinity algebras]] over the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]
of the [[integers]],
whereas animation produces connective [[E-infinity ring spectra]].

## Animation

In some cases, there is an automatic (∞,1)-categorification. For example, the [[animation]] $\mathrm{Ani}(C)$ of a cocomplete category $C$ that is generated under colimits by its subcategory $C^{\mathrm{sfp}}$ of compact projective objects, is the (∞,1)-category freely generated by $C^{sfp}$ under sifted colimits. (See Kęstutis Česnavičius and Peter Scholze, Sec. 5.1.4.)

For example, the animation of the 1-category of modules over an ordinary [[ring]] $R$ is the (∞,1)-category of connective [[module spectra]] over the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg-MacLane ring spectrum]] $\mathrm{H}R$.

## Further Examples

In the table below, structures on the left are always understood up to an isomorphism, whereas on the right we explicitly indicate the notion of a weak equivalence used (except for [[Platonic forms]] such as [[(∞,1)-categories]]).
