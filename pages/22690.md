## Definition

A [[monoid]] (or [[semigroup]]) $M$ is a __left GCD monoid__ if for all elements $m,n \in M$, there is a unique minimal left [[ideal of a monoid|ideals]] in $M$ generated by $m$ and $n$. Similarily, __right GCD monoid__ if for all elements $m,n \in M$, there is a unique minimal right [[ideal of a monoid|ideals]] in $M$ generated by $m$ and $n$. Finally, $M$ is a __two-sided GCD monoid__ if it is both a left GCD monoid and a right GCD monoid, and $M$ is a __GCD monoid__ if $M$ is a two-sided GCD monoid and for all elements $m,n \in M$ the minimal left and right ideals generated by $m$ and $n$ coincide.
