## Idea

There are two kinds of higher dimensional generalizations of ordinary 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] that are often called "higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory" in the literature. Both are special cases of [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]].

Recall that for $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]] (not necessarily abelian) with non-generate binary [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle -,-\rangle$, the corresponding [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]] [[QFT]] is ordinary [[Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension 3.

But also every other [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle-,-,\cdots,-\rangle$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ induces an [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]], now in higher dimension. 

Moreover, every [[line Lie n-algebra]] $b^n \mathbb{R}$ carries a canonical invariant polynomial. The [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]] associated with that is often called _abelian higher dimensional CS theory_ .

(...)

More general "higher"-generalization of Chern-Simons theory to [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]] allow $\mathfrak{g}$ to be a (nonabelian) [[Lie 2-algebra]] or more generally a (nobabelian) [[L-infinity algebra]] or fully generally a [[L-infinity algebroid]].

## Higher abelian Chern-Simons theory.






## Examples

Higher dimensional abelian Chern-Simons theories appear automatically as components of systems of higher [[supergravity]], for instance in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] (they are automatically induced by the requirement of  [[local supersymmetry]] in these higher dimensional supergravity theories).

(...)

## Properties

Higher Chern-Simons theory in dimension $4k+3$ is related by a [[holographic principle]] to [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] in dimension $4k+2$ (at least in the abelian case).
