## Idea

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]] with non-generate binary [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle -,-\rangle$, the corresponding [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]] [[QFT]] is ordinary [[Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension 3.

But also every other [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle-,-,\cdots,-\rangle$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ induces an [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory]], now in higher dimension. This is often called _higher Chern-Simons theory_ . 

Here we say _higher dimensional_ (but otherwise ordinary) Chern-Simons theory in order to distinguish from the more general "higher"-generalization, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is allowed to be a [[Lie 2-algebra]] or more generally an [[L-infinity algebra]] or fully generally a [[L-infinity algebroid]].


## Examples

Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theories appear automatically as components of systems of higher [[supergravity]], for instance in [[1-dimensional supergravity]] (they are automatically induced by the requirement of  [[local supersymmetry]] in these higher dimensional supergravity theories).

(...)

## Properties

Higher Chern-Simons theory in dimension $4k+3$ is related by a [[holographic principle]] to [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] in dimension $4k+2$ (at least in the abelian case).
