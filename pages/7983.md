## Definition

For $G$ a [[group]] and $g \in G$ an element, the _conjugacy class_ of $g$ is the subset $\{ h g h^{-1} | h \in G \} \subset G$ of all elements in $G$ obtained from $g$ by [[conjugation]] with another group element.

## Examples

* The conjugacy class of the neutral element consists of precisely only the neutral element itself.
