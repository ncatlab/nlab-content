## Idea ##

The [[groupoidal categorification]] of a [[differential ring]]. Hypothetically, a [[1-truncation]] of some "differential [[A-infinity-ring|$A_\infty$-ring]]". 

## Definition ##

A **differential ring groupoid** is a [[ring groupoid]] $R$ with a [[symmetric 2-group]] [[functor]] $d:R \to R$ which preserves the symmetric 2-group structure of $R$, with an [[isomorphism]] $i_{a, b}:d(a \otimes b) \cong (a \otimes d(b)) \oplus (d(a) \otimes b)$ and coherence conditions (if any) which have not been figured out yet by the creator of this article.
