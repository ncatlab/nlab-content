## Idea

In [[constructive mathematics]], we often do [[algebra]] by equipping an [[gebra|algebra]] with a [[tight apartness]] (and requiring the algebraic operations to be [[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]]).  In this context, it is convenient to replace [[subalgebras]] with _anti_-subalgebras, which [[classical mathematics|classically]] are simply the [[complements]] of subalgebras.


## Definitions

Let us work in the context of [[universal algebra]], so an __algebra__ is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a family of [[functions]] $f_i\colon X^{n_i} \to X$ (where each [[arity]] $n_i$ is a [[cardinal number]]) that satisfy certain equational identities (which are irrelevant here).  As usual, a __subalgebra__ of $X$ is a [[subset]] $S$ such that $f_i(p_1,\ldots,p_{n_i}) \in S$ whenever each $p_k \in S$.  There is no need, in general, to require that any arity $n_i$ be finite or that there be finitely many $f_i$; however, for a few results, we will need a special case of these that we will call having __well-behaved constants__:

* each arity is either $0$ or at least $1$ (so each operation either is a constant or has at least one operand), and
* the number of constants is [[Kuratowski-finite]] (so there is an exhaustive list $c_1, c_2, c_3, \ldots c_n$ of constants for some [[natural number]] $n$, where it remains possible that $c_i = c_j$ might be an equational law).

The first item is true of all derived operations in the theory as long as it is true of the fundamental operations in the signature; but in this last item, we\'re counting all derived constants, not just the fundamental ones.  For example, the theory of (unital) [[rings]] does *not* have well-behaved constants, because there are infinitely many constants (one for each [[integer]]).

Now we require $S$ to have a [[tight apartness]] $\ne$, which induces a tight apartness on each $X^{n_i}$ (via [[existential quantification]]), and we require the operations $f_i$ to be [[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]].  An algebra $X$ with these properties is called an **inequality algebra**.  (For much of the theory we don't need the apartness to be tight, but for some purposes it is necessary.)

A [[subset]] $A$ of $X$ is __[[open subset|open]]__ (or $\ne$-open) if, whenever $p \in A$, $q \in A$ or $p \ne q$.  An __antisubalgebra__ of $X$ is an open subset $A$ such that $p_j \in A$ for some $j$ whenever $f_i(p_1,\ldots,p_{n_i}) \in A$ for any $i$.  By taking the [[contrapositive]], we see that the [[complement]] of $A$ is a subalgebra $S$, but we cannot (in general) start with a subalgebra $S$ and get an antisubalgebra $A$.  (Impredicatively, we can take the antisubalgebra generated, as described below, by the $\ne$-complement of $S$, that is the set of those elements of $X$ that $\ne$ every element of $S$, but its complement will generally only be a superset of $S$.)


## Examples

Unless otherwise noted, all of the constructions in these examples should be [[predicative mathematics|predicative]].

The [[empty subset]] of any algebra is an antisubalgebra, the __empty antisubalgebra__ or __improper antisubalgebra__, whose complement is the [[improper subset|improper]] subalgebra (which is all of $X$).  An antisubalgebra is __[[proper subset|proper]]__ if it is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]]; the ability to have a positive definition of when an antisubalgebra is proper is a significant motivation for the concept.

If $A$ is an antisubalgebra and $c$ is a constant (given by an operation $X^0 \to X$ or a composite of same with other operations), then $p \ne c$ whenever $p \in A$.  If the theory has well-behaved constants, then we can define the __trivial antisubalgebra__ to be the subset of those elements $p$ such that $p \ne c$ for each constant $c$ (the $\ne$-complement of the [[trivial subalgebra]]).  In general, we may also take the __trivial antisubalgebra__ to be the [[union]] of all antisubalgebras (but this is not predicative).

Instead of [[subgroups]], use antisubgroups.  In this case the definition can be simplified a bit: a subset $A$ of an inequality group $X$ is an __antisubgroup__ if $p \ne 1 $ whenever $p \in A$, $p \in A$ or $q \in A$ whenever $p q \in A$, and $p \in A$ whenever $p^{-1} \in A$.  We need not assume that $A$ is open; this can be proved from strong extensionality of the group operations on $X$ and the stronger form of the nullary anticlosure condition ("$p \ne 1 $ whenever $p \in A$" is a strengthening of the condition $\neg (1\in A)$ that would be the literal nullary case of the general definition.)  An antisubgroup $A$ is __[[normal subgroup|normal]]__ if $p q \in A$ whenever $q p \in A$.  The __[[trivial subgroup|trivial]] antisubgroup__ is the $\ne$-complement of $\{1\}$.

Instead of [[ideals]] (of [[rings]]), use antiideals.  (Technically, these are antisubalgebras of the ring as a module over itself.)  Again we can omit $\ne$-openness by strengthening the nullary condition.  In detail, a subset $A$ of $X$ is a __two-sided antiideal__ (or simply an __antiideal__ in the commutative case) if $p \ne 0 $ whenever $p \in A$, $p \in A$ or $q \in A$ whenever $p + q \in A$, and $p \in A$ and $q \in A$ whenever $p q \in A$.  $A$ is a __left antiideal__ if instead the last condition requires only that $p \in A$, and $A$ is a __right antiideal__ if instead the last condition requires only that $q \in A$.  It follows that an antiideal $A$ is proper iff $1 \in A$.  $A$ is __[[prime ideal|prime]]__ (or _antiprime_) if it is proper and $p q \in A$ whenever $p \in A$ and $q \in A$; $A$ is __[[maximal ideal|minimal]]__ (or _antimaximal_) if it is proper and, for each $p \in A$, for some $q$, for each $r \in A$, $p q + r \ne 1$ and $q p + r \ne 1$ (which is constructively stronger than being prime and [[minimal element|minimal]] among proper ideals).  The __[[trivial ideal|trivial]] antiideal__ is the $\ne$-complement of $\{0\}$.

Note that a [[union]] of antisubalgebras is again an antisubalgebra.  Given any subset $B$ of $X$, the antisubalgebra __generated__ by $B$ is the union of all antisubalgebras contained in $B$.  (This construction is not predicative, although it may still be true predicatively that the generated subalgebra exists in some situations.)


## Quotient algebras

To form a [[quotient group]] or a [[quotient ring]], it\'s enough to have a [[normal subgroup]] or a [[two-sided ideal]].  However, if we want the quotient algebra to inherit an apartness from the original algebra, then we need antisubgroups and antiideals.

In general, instead of [[congruence relations]], use anticongruence relations.  An __anticongruence relation__ $K$ on $X$ is an [[apartness relation]] on $X$ that is also an antisubalgebra of $X \times X$.  Given this, let $R$ be the [[negation]] of $K$; then $R$ is a congruence relation, giving a quotient algebra $X/R$.  Furthermore, $K$ becomes a [[tight relation|tight]] apartness on $X/R$, relative to which the algebra operations on $X/R$ are strongly extensional.  We denote the resulting algebra-with-apartness by $X/K$.  (This notation should cause no confusion; if an apartness relation on a set $X$ is also an equivalence relation, then $X$ must be the [[empty set]], which has a unique apartness and at most one algebra structure, and the only [[quotient set]] of the empty set is itself.)  The quotient map $X \twoheadrightarrow X/K$ is also strongly extensional.

Conversely, any strongly extensional map $f\colon X \to Y$ between algebras with apartness gives rise to an anticongruence $\aker f$ on $X$ (the __antikernel__ of $f$), where $(p, q) \in \aker f$ iff $f(p) \ne f(q)$.  The complement of the antikernel is (because the apartness of $Y$ is tight) the [[kernel]] in the usual sense of universal algebra.  Thus, the quotient algebra $X/(\aker f)$ is [[naturally isomorphic]] to a [[subalgebra]] $im f$ of $Y$; the maps $X \twoheadrightarrow X/(\aker f) \cong \im f \hookrightarrow Y$ are strongly extensional.  Similarly, a sequence $X \overset{f}\to Y \overset{g} \to Z$ is [[exact sequence|exact]] iff $\im f$ is the complement of $\aker g$.

(We would like to say that there is an antisubalgebra $\aim f$ of $Y$ whose complement is $\im f$; then we could, for example, define a stronger notion of exactness requiring that $\aker g$ equal the antiimage of $f$.  In principle, $\aim f$ should be the $\ne$-complement of $\im f$.  If $X$ is Kuratowski-finite, then this works, but in general, we can prove neither that this is open nor that its complement is all of $\im f$.)

Given a group-with-apartness and a normal antisubgroup $A$, we define an anticongruence $K$, where $(p, q) \in K$ iff $p q^{-1} \in A$.  Similarly, given a ring-with-apartness and a two-sided antiideal $A$, we define an anticongruence $K$, where $(p, q) \in K$ iff $p - q \in A$.  This allows us to form quotient groups or quotient rings by modding out by normal antisubgroups or two-sided antiideals.  Conversely, we can interpret the antikernel as a normal antisubgroup or two-sided antiideal: $p \in \aker f$ iff $f(p) \ne 1$, $p \in \aker f$ iff $f(p) \ne 0$, etc.  In general, this works for any [[Omega-group]] structure.


## Localic point of view

As noted at [[apartness relation]], an apartness relation on a set $X$ is equivalent to a (strongly) closed [[equivalence relation]] on the corresponding [[discrete locale]], and the $\ne$-open subsets are those whose complementary closed sublocales are stable under this equivalence relation, and the $\ne$-topology itself is the corresponding quotient locale.  From this point of view, an algebra structure is strongly extensional if it respects the equivalence relation, hence passes to the quotient; and an antisubalgebra is an $\ne$-open set whose complementary closed sublocale is additionally a localic subalgebra, since the operation $\mathsf{C}$ from open sublocales to closed ones takes arbitrary (not only finite) unions to intersections.

In other words, antisubalgebras of an inequality algebra are equivalent to closed subalgebras of a localic algebra, in the case when the latter is the quotient of a discrete algebra by a closed localic congruence.

> The study of algebraic structures in an intuitionistic setting was undertaken by Heyting ([1941](#Heyting1941))... in full generality, equipped with an apartness relation.  The notion of an antisubstructure, implicit in Heyting's treatment of ideals in polynomial rings, was formulated explicitly by D.S. Scott ([1979](#Scott1979)) (N.B. the first draft of this paper contains a good deal more than the published version).  Ruitenburg ([1982](#Ruitenberg1982Thesis), [1982A](#Ruitenberg1982)) deals with intuitionistic algebra in the spirit of Heyting and Scott.
