## Idea

In [[constructive mathematics]], we often do [[algebra]] by equipping an [[gebra|algebra]] with a [[tight apartness]] (and requiring the algebraic operations to be [[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]]).  In this context, it is convenient to replace [[subalgebras]] with _anti_-subalgebras, which [[classical mathematics|classically]] are simply the [[complements]] of subalgebras.


## Definitions

Let us work in the context of [[universal algebra]], so an __algebra__ is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a family of [[functions]] $f_i\colon X^{n_i} \to X$ (where each [[arity]] $n_i$ is a [[cardinal number]]) that satisfy certain equational identities (which are irrelevant here).  As usual, a __subalgebra__ of $X$ is a [[subset]] $S$ such that $f_i(p_1,\ldots,p_{n_i}) \in S$ whenever each $p_k \in S$.

Now we require $S$ to have a [[tight apartness]] $\ne$, which induces a tight apartness on each $X^{n_i}$ (via [[existential quantification]]), and we require the operations $f_i$ to be [[strongly extensional function|strongly extensional]].  (There is no need to require that any arity $n_i$ be finite or that there be finitely many $f_i$.)

A [[subset]] $A$ of $X$ is __[[open subset|open]]__ (relative to $\ne$) if $p \in A$ or $p \ne q$ whenever $q \in A$.  An __antisubalgebra__ of $X$ is an open subset $A$ such that some $p_k \in A$ whenever $f_i(p_1,\ldots,p_{n_i}) \in A$.  By taking the [[contrapositive]], we see that the [[complement]] of $A$ is a subalgebra $S$; then $A$ may be recovered as the $\ne$-complement of $S$ (the set of those $p$ such that $p \ne q$ whenever $q \in S$).  However, we cannot start with an arbitrary subalgebra $S$ and get an antisubalgebra $A$ in this way, as we cannot (in general) prove openness.  (We can take the antisubalgebra generated by the $\ne$-complement of $S$, as described below, but its complement will generally only be a superset of $S$.)


## Examples

The [[empty subset]] of any algebra is an antisubalgebra, the __empty antisubalgebra__ or __improper antisubalgebra__, whose complement is the [[improper subset|improper]] subalgebra (which is all of $X$).  An antisubalgebra is __[[proper subset|proper]]__ if it is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]]; the ability to have a positive definition of when an antisubalgebra is proper is a significant motivation for the concept.

If $A$ is an antisubalgebra and $c$ is a constant (given by an operation $X^0 \to X$ or a composite of same with other operations), then $p \ne c$ whenever $p \in A$.  If there are only [[Kuratowski-finite set|Kuratowski-finitely]] many constants (which is needed to prove openness), we define the __trivial antisubalgebra__ to be the subset of those elements $p$ such that $p \ne c$ for each constant $c$ (the $\ne$-complement of the [[trivial subalgebra]]).  In general, we may also take the __trivial antisubalgebra__ to be the [[union]] of all antisubalgebras, although this is not [[predicative mathematics|predicative]].

Instead of [[subgroups]], use antisubgroups.  In detail, $A$ is an __antisubgroup__ if $p \ne 1 $ whenever $p \in A$, $p \in A$ or $q \in A$ whenever $p q \in A$, and $p \in A$ whenever $p^{-1} \in A$.  An antisubgroup $A$ is __[[normal subgroup|normal]]__ if $p q \in A$ whenever $q p \in A$.  The __[[trivial subgroup|trivial]] antisubgroup__ is the $\ne$-complement of $\{1\}$.

Instead of [[ideals]] (of [[commutative rings]]), use antiideals (and we also have left and right antiideals of general [[rings]]).  In detail, $A$ is an __antiideal__ if $p \ne 0 $ whenever $p \in A$, $p \in A$ or $q \in A$ whenever $p + q \in A$, and $p \in A$ whenever $p q \in A$.  It follows that an antiideal $A$ is proper iff $1 \in A$.  $A$ is __[[prime ideal|prime]]__ if it is proper and $p q \in A$ whenever $p \in A$ and $q \in A$; $A$ is __[[maximal ideal|minimal]]__ if it is proper and, for each $p \in A$, for some $q$, for each $r \in A$, $p q + r \ne 1$ (which is constructively stronger than being prime and [[minimal element|minimal]] among proper ideals).  The __[[trivial ideal|trivial]] antiideal__ is the $\ne$-complement of $\{0\}$.

Given any subset $B$ of $X$, the antisubalgebra __generated__ by $B$ is the [[union]] of all antisubalgebras contained in $B$.  (This construction, unlike those above, is not [[predicative mathematics|predicative]].)
