A [[subset]] $A$ of a [[set]] $S$ is __proper__ if $A$ is not equal to $S$ as a subset of itself.  Equivalently, $A$ is proper if there exists an element $x$ of $S$ such that $x \notin A$.

Actually, these two definitions are equivalent only if we accept the principle of [[excluded middle]]; in [[constructive mathematics]], we usually prefer the latter definition.  However, it is common that even this is not strong enough and we need to replace the condition that $x \notin A$ by some stronger condition not involving [[negation]].  (For example, consider a [[proper filter]] on a set $X$, considered a subset of the [[power set]] of $X$.)
