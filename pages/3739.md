A [[subset]] $A$ of a [[set]] $S$ is __proper__ if $A$ is not equal to the [[improper subset]] of $S$ ($S$ as a subset of itself).  We may also state that $A$ is proper in either or these equivalent ways:

*  There exists an element $x$ of $S$ such that $x \notin A$;
*  Given any way of expressing $A$ as the [[intersection]] of a family of subsets of $S$, this family is [[inhabited set|inhabited]]. 

Actually, these two definitions are equivalent only if we accept the principle of [[excluded middle]]; in [[constructive mathematics]], we usually prefer the last definition.  (For example, consider the notion of [[proper filter]] on a set $X$, thought of as a subset of the [[power set]] of $X$.)  However, this definition is not [[predicative mathematics|predicative]].
