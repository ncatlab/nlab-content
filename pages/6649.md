# Saturated classes of limits
* table of contents

## Idea

A class $\mathcal{X}$ of [[limits]] is *saturated* if it is closed under the "construction" of other limits out of limits in $\mathcal{X}$.

## Definition

Let $V$ be a [[Bénabou cosmos]], and let $\mathcal{X}$ be a [[class]] of $V$-functors $\Phi\colon D\to V$ where $D$ is a [[small category|small]] $V$-category.  Note that the domain $D$ may be different for different elements of $\mathcal{X}$.

Any such $\Phi\colon D\to V$ can serve as a *weight* for defining the [[weighted limit]] of a $V$-functor $D\to C$, for any $V$-category $C$.  We say that a $V$-category is **$\mathcal{X}$-complete** if it admits all such limits, for all $\Phi\in\mathcal{X}$, and thath a $V$-functor between $\mathcal{X}$-complete $V$-categories is **$\mathcal{X}$-continuous** if it preserves all such limits.

The **saturation** of $\mathcal{X}$ is the class of all weights $\Phi\colon D\to V$ (with $D$ small) such that

1. Any $\mathcal{X}$-complete $V$-category admits $\Phi$-weighted limits, and
1. Any $\mathcal{X}$-continuous $V$-functor preserves $\Phi$-weighted limits.

It is an open question whether the second condition is implied by the first in general.

Finally, $\mathcal{X}$ is **saturated** if it is its own saturation.

## Characterization

The main theorem of [AK](#AK) (which introduced the notion under the name "closure") is the following.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
$\Phi\colon D\to V$ lies in the saturation of $\mathcal{X}$ if and only if it lies in the closure of the [[representable functor|representables]] under $\mathcal{X}$-weighted colimits in $[D,V]$.

## Examples

The following examples are all for $V=Set$:

* The class of small [[products]] is saturated, as is the class of finite products.  The latter is the saturation of the finite class containing only [[terminal objects]] and binary products.

* The class of [[finite limits]] is saturated.  It is the saturation of the finite class containing only terminal objects and [[pullbacks]], and also the saturation of the class containing only finite products and [[equalizers]].

There are also interesting examples for other $V$.

* When $V=Cat$, the classes of [[PIE-limits]] and [[flexible limits]] are saturated.  The former is, essentially by definition, the saturation of the class containing products, [[inserters]], and [[equifiers]].  The latter can be proven to be the saturation of the class containing products, inserters, equifiers, and [[splitting of idempotents]].

* When $V=F$ is the category of [[fully faithful functors]], so that a $V$-category is an [[F-category]], the class of $w$-[[rigged weight|rigged weights]] is saturated (for any of $w=p$, $l$, or $c$ denoting pseudo, lax, or colax).

It is also worth mentioning some non-examples.

* For $V=Cat$, the class of [[strict pseudo-limits]] is not saturated; it does not even contain the representables.  (The same is true for strict lax limits.)  It is unclear precisely what its saturation looks like.
