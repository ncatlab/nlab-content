Configuration schemes are a generalization of [[schemes]] which are obtained via formal gluing of the usual schemes along closed embeddings. In fact, the categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] are glued. Standard [[cohomology theory]] and the study of [[coherent sheaves]] extend to them. Configuration schemes were thought of to provide a nonclassical type of resolution of [[singularity|singularities]], and they can be a part of a categorical version of resolution of singularities.
