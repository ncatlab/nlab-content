## Definition

A _global field_ is either


* a [[number field]]

* or a [[function field]] over a [[finite field]];

and hence is a [[finite number|finite]]-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[field extension]] of either

* the [[rational number]] $\mathbb{Q}$;

* the [[rational functions]] $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[finite field]] $\mathbb{F}_q$.

The [[function field analogy]] says how both these kinds of global fields are indeed analogousm in that they behave have as rings of [[rational functions]] on [[arithmetic curves]] over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and "over [[F1]]", respectively. In particular for both types there is a concept of [[ring of adeles]], [[group of ideles]], etc.

The [[Langlands conjectures]] concern the [[arithmetic geometry]] of global fields.

The "local" version of a global field in the sense of [[formal geometry]] is a [[local field]]. The corresponding version of the Langlands program are the _[[local Langlands correspondences]]_.
