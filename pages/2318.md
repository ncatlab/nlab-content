## Idea

The notion of _Fivebrane structure_ is the next higher analog of that of [[spin structure]] and [[string structure]].

Recall from the discussion there that a [[string structure]] on [[manifold]] $X$ with [[spin structure]] is a lift $\hat g$ of the classifying map $g : X \to B Spin(n)$ of the [[tangent bundle]] associated to a [[Spin group]]-[[principal bundle]] through the next step in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$, called $B String(n)$ -- the [[delooping]] of the [[String group]]:

$$
  \array{
    && B String(n)
    \\
    & {\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B Spin(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

The names "Spin" and "String" both derive from the role these structures play in [[quantum field theory]]: a [[spin structure]] is required on $X$ for it to serve as a target space for spinning particles (superparticles), while a [[string structure]] is required for it to serves as a target for "spinning strings" -- superstrings -- (see [[heterotic string theory]] for more).
Topologists just say (said) $O(n)\langle 2\rangle$ for $Spin(n)$ and $O(n)\langle 6\rangle$ for $String(n)$, respectively. 

They wrote $O(n)\langle 8\rangle$ for the next step in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$.

It was [[Hisham Sati]] who first realized that a lift of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ to this highly connected structure group is related to $X$ serving as a target for "spinning 5-branes" -- super-5-branes -- in what is called [[dual heterotic string theory]]. Following the history of the term [[String group]] he gave the topological group $O(n)\langle 8\rangle$ the name [[Fivebrane group]]:  $Fivebrane(n)$.

Accordingly, a **Fivebrane structure(n)** on a manifold $X$ with [[string structure]] is a lift of $\hat g : X \to B String(n)$ to $\hat \hat g$

$$
  \array{
    && B Fivebrane(n)
    \\
    & {\hat \hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\hat g}{\to}& B String(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

The obstruction class to this lift is a fractional multiply of the second [[Pontrjagin class]]. Namely the generator of $H^8(B String, \mathbb{Z})$ is $\frac{1}{6}p_2$, 

$$
  \array{
     B String &\stackrel{1/6 p_2}{\to}& B^8 \mathbb{Z}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\cdot 6}}
     \\
     B SO &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& B^8 \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

(stated in [SSS2](#SSS2), then in [DHH](#DHH), also follows from the [[index theory]] argument leading to (3.3) in [Witten 96](#Witten96)).

The [[Fivebrane group]] is the [[loop space object]] of the corresponding [[homotopy fiber]]

$$
  \array{
    B Fivebrane &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B String &\stackrel{\frac{1}{6}}{\to}& B^7 U(1)&
  }
$$

and so, by the [[universal property]] of the [[homotopy pullback]], String-structures $\hat g$ lift to Fivebrane structures precisely if $\frac{1}{6}p_2(\hat g)$ is trivial in [[cohomology]]

$$
  \array{
    && B Fivebrane &\to& * 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \hat g}}\nearrow & \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\hat g}{\to}& B String &\stackrel{\frac{1}{6}p_2}{\to}& B^7 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

In ([SSS2](#SSS2)) the physical interpretation of this topological lift was established by comparison with known [[quantum anomaly]] cancellaton conditions in [[dual heterotic string theory]].

The term "Fivebrane" apparently quickly caught on in the mathematical community, for instance in ([DouglasHenriquesHill](#DHH)).

Since [[gauge theory]] is not just about [[principal bundle]]s, but about principal [[connection on a bundle|bundles with connection]], what matters in physics is not just the topological Spin-, String- and Fivebrane structures, but their refinement to [[schreiber:differential nonabelian cohomology]]. See [[differential fivebrane structure]].
