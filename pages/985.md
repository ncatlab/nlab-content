## Idea

For a sufficiently nice topological space, the fundamental group at a point can be reconstructed as a group of deck transformations of the [[universal covering space]], which is the same as the automorphisms of the fiber over that point of the projection map. The deck transformations are monodromies induced by loops at the base point; intuitively they can be taken infinitesimally, and viewed as symmetries of the point. The functor which assigns to a point the fiber functor over it, generalizes to fiber functors in Tannakian formalism of Grothendieck which defines in more general setups the fundamental groupoid as the group of automorphisms of the appropriate fiber functor. See also [[fundamental group of a topos]]. 

Grothendieck's [[Galois theory]] was constructed in order to define for [[scheme]]s an analogue of the familiar correspondence

: [[covering space]]s of $X$ : $\pi_1(X)$[[action|-sets]]

for a [[locally path-connected space|locally path connected]], [[semi-locally simply connected space|semilocally simply connected]] [[topological space]] $X$. 

The objects on the left are not difficult to define for schemes (at least naively -- one really needs trivialisations over étale [[coverage|covers]]), but it may not be entirely immediate what the [[fundamental group]] defined in terms of loops should be.

The reason Galois's name is attached to this theory is that in the case of the scheme $Spec(k)$, the objects corresponding to the covering spaces are simply [[field extension]]s $Spec(k')$. The fundamental group of schemes defined in this way is the [[algebraic fundamental group]], and is a [[profinite group]].

### Generalizations

The basic idea of Grothendieck's Galois theory may be extended to objects in an [[topos]] -- leading to a notion of [[fundamental group of a topos]] --  and then further to objects in any [[(∞,1)-topos]]. For more on this see [[homotopy group of an ∞-stack]].

## Details

### Preliminaries

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
Given an arrow $f:x \to y$ in a category $C$ the _category of arrows compatible with $f$_, denoted $Comp(f)$ is the full [[subcategory]] of the [[undercategory]] $x \downarrow C$ on the arrows that [[coequalizer|coequalize]] the same pairs $g,h:w\rightrightarrows x$ that $f$ does.

###### Definition
An arrow $f:x\to y$ in a category $C$ is a _[[strict epimorphism]]_ if it is [[initial object|initial]] in $Comp(f)$.
=--

It is not obvious, but a strict epimorphism is an epimorphism.

### Grothendieck's axioms

In what follows, Let $C$ be a [[category]] and $F:C \to Set$ a [[functor]]. The axioms presented here are as in

* [[Eduardo Dubuc]], C. S. de la Vega _On the Galois theory on Grothendieck_, Bol. Acad. Nac. Cienc. (Cordoba) **65** (2000) 111--136. [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0009145)

Some terminology: $X\in C$ is called _finite_ if $F(X)$ is a finite [[set]]. Let $\int_F C$ denote the [[category of elements]] of $F$, in which an object $(X,a)$ is called finite if $X$ is finite.

* **G0)** The full subcategory of $\int_F C$ on the finite objects is [[cofinal subcategory|cofinal]].

* **G1)** $C$ has all finite [[limit]]s

* **G2)** $C$ has an [[initial object]], finite [[coproduct]]s and [[quotient object|quotients]] by finite [[group]]s

* **G3)** Given $f:x\to z$ in $C$ there is a factorisation $x \stackrel{e}{\to} y \stackrel{i}{\to} z$ where $e$ is a strict epimorphism and $i$ is a mono. Also, $y$ is assumed to be a [[direct sum]]mand of $z$.

* **G4)** $F$ preserves finite limits

* **G5)** $F$ preserves initial object, finite sums, quotients by finite group actions and sends strict epimorphisms to surjections

* **G6)** $F$ reflects isomorphisms

***

It follows from the axioms that $F$ is a [[pro-representable functor]]. The [[automorphism group]] of the [[pro-object]] $P$ representing $F$ is (should be. I'm not familiar enough with pro-objects) a [[profinite group]] $\pi$. This acts on $F(X) = [P,-]$ by precomposition (talking out of my depth here -- it's getting a bit vague) and so $F$ lifts to a functor to $\pi-Set$, and Grothendieck's result is that this functor is an [[equivalence of categories]].

There are several modifications one can make the above. In the case that $C$ is the category of covering spaces of a nice enough space, the functor $F$ is [[representable functor|representable]] by the [[universal covering space]], and so there is a 'representable' version of the above, not needing to utilise profinite groups. One can also consider just the connected-objects version, and end up with an equivalence to the category of _transitive_ $\pi$-sets.

## The classical case of fields

Even for the classical case of the inclusion of fields, Grothendieck's Galois theorem gives more general statement than the previously known. This is the Grothendieck's version of the Galois correspondence theorem for fields:

Let $K \subset L$ be a finite dimensional Galois extension of fields. Let $Gal[L : K]$ denote the group of $K$-automorphisms of $L$ and $Gal [L : K]-finSet$ the category of finite $Gal[L : K]$-sets. By $SplitfinAlg_K(L)$ denote the finite dimensional $K$-algebras which are split over $L$; here $L$ itself is an object. Consider the representable functor $h_L = Hom_K(-,L):SplitfinAlg_K(L)\to Set$. It takes values in the subcategory of finite sets and it comes with a canonical $Gal[L : K]$-action. In other words, this functor factors through $Gal [L : K]-finSet$. Moreover, the corresponding functor 

$$
SplitfinAlg_K(L)\to Gal [L : K]-finSet
$$ 

is an equivalence of categories. 

There is an infinitary version as well, generalizing the classical Galois theorem on infinitary Galois extensions. 

Thus let $K\subset L$ be an arbitrary Galois extension. Now $Gal[L:K]$ denotes the profinite Galois group and $Gal[L:K]-profinSpace$ the category or profinite $Gal[L:K]$-spaces. $SplitAlg_K(L)$ denotes the category of $K$-algebras split over $L$ (possible infinite-dimensional). Then there is a canonical antiequivalence of categories

$$
SplitAlg_K(L)\to Gal [L : K]-profinSpace
$$

(factorizing a profinite-space version of the representable functor $Hom_K(-,L)$).
