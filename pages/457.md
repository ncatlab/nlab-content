## Idea

In [[set theory]],  an **inhabited set** or **occupied set** is a [[set]] that contains an [[element]].

More generally, in [[type theory]] an **inhabited type** is a [[type]] that has a [[term]].

At least assuming [[classical logic]], this is the same thing as a set that is [[negation|not]] [[empty set|empty]]. Usually inhabited sets are simply called 'non-empty', but the positive word 'inhabited' reminds us that this is the simpler notion, which emptiness is defined as the [[negation]] of.

The terms 'inhabited' and 'occupied' come from [[constructive mathematics]]. In constructive mathematics (such as the [[internal logic]] of some [[topos]] or generally in [[type theory]]), a set/type that is not empty is not already necessarily inhabited.  This is because [[double negation]] is nontrivial in [[intuitionistic logic]]. All the same, many constructive mathematicians use the old word 'non-empty' with the understanding that it *really* means inhabited.

There is a distinction between 'inhabited' and 'occupied' spaces in [[Abstract Stone Duality]] (which probably corresponds to something about [[locales]], should explain that here).

An inhabited set is the special case of an [[inhabited object]] in the [[topos]] [[Set]].
