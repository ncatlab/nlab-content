A [[morphism]] $e: B\to B$ in a [[category]] is an **idempotent** if $e e = e$.

A **splitting** of an idempotent $e$ consists of morphisms $s: A \to B$ and $r: B \to A$ such that $r \circ s = 1_A$ and $s \circ r = e$.  In this case $A$ is a [[retract]] of $B$, and we call $e$ a [[split idempotent]].
