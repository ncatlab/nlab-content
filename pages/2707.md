### Informal idea
 {#InformalIdea}

> In order to express this kinship of these different cohomological theories, I formulated the notion of “motive” associated to an algebraic variety. By this term I want to suggest that it is the “common motive” (or “common reason”) behind this multitude of cohomological invariants attached to an algebraic variety, or indeed, behind all cohomological invariants that are a priori possible. ([[Grothendieck]], [[Recoltes et Semailles]])

The similarity of the behaviour of various [[cohomologies]] of [[algebraic variety|varieties]] over a [[field]] suggests that there is a universal one among them with values in an intermediate [[abelian category]], called the _[[category]] of motives_. The idea is that for every variety $X$, there is a motive $M(X)$ and good [[cohomology theories]] would factor through the projection. (Here not every motive is supposed to be the image of a single variety.)

[[Grothendieck]]'s original realization of this idea is the [[category of Chow motives]], which is a certain abelianization and completion of a [[category of spans]] of [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]]. Later a more [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] version was given, the [[Voevodsky motives]] or _derived motives_, see [below](#IdeaOfAbstractDefinition), which subsume the Chow motives faithfully. More generally still, there are definitions for _[[noncommutative motives]]_ obtained by passing to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

Finally the construction principle of motives can also be adapted to other flavors of [[geometry]]. For instance in [[noncommutative topology]] the role of the category of [[noncommutative motives]] is played by [[KK-theory]]. 

One distinguishes a theory of [[pure motives]] from a version with further filtrations, the [[mixed motives]]. 
So far there are realizations of [[pure motives]], and not of the mixed motives. However there are several equivalent definitions of a [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[tensor category]] which has all conjectured structural properties of the derived category of mixed motives (except for the t-structure which would make it a derived category); hence it is denoted $D(\mathcal{M M})$.

Constructions of motives depend much on whether we work in prime [[characteristic]]s or in characteristic zero. Part of the formalism involves more general [[schemes]] than varieties. 

Another crucial idea leading to motives is that the various cohomologies lead to the same pieces of information; therefore there is a symmetry related to this, which is of [[Galois theory]] nature. For example, over the [[complex numbers]] one can compare the [[Betti cohomology]] and [[de Rham cohomology]] "realizations". Thus one has a  [[motivic Galois group]], and as usually with representations one has a [[tensor category]] structure which is also [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]]. Thus one has in fact an [[abelian category|abelian]] [[tensor category]] of motives. [[Tannakian reconstruction]] plays a major role; for pure motives we have neutral [[Tannakian category|Tannakian categories]], and for mixed motives we have mixed Tannakian categories. Functions on the [[torsor]] of the isomorphism between "realizations" correspond to the matrices of [[period]]s in [[Hodge theory]]. 

$L$-functions (and $\zeta$-functions in particular) of varieties are also invariants of their motives. The [[Langlands program]] indirectly involves motives; in particular its essential part can be expressed as a general modularity conjecture relating $L$-functions to automorphic functions. Most of the deep properties of [[elliptic curve]]s are of motivic nature, and in particular a major step of the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] by Wiles and Taylor can be interpreted as a proof of a special case of the modularity conjecture (for elliptic curves). 

### Idea of the precise abstract definition of derived motives
 {#IdeaOfAbstractDefinition}

We indicate the simple idea of the formal general abstract definition of derived mixed motives, as originally indicated in [Deligne's transcript of Voevodsky's lectures](#Deligne) and then elaborated on by ([Ayoub](#Ayoub)). We follow the introduction of ([Cisinski-Déglise 09](#CisinskiDeglise)).

On some [[site]] $\mathcal{C}$ of ([[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich]]) [[schemes]] (or maybe some other kinds of [[spaces]]), consider [[functors]] (or maybe rather [[(∞,1)-functors]])

$$
  D \colon \mathcal{C} \to Stab\infty Cat
$$

with values in [[closed monoidal (∞,1)-category|closed monoidal]] [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] (or some presentation theoreof, such as suitably [[enhanced triangulated category|enhanced]] [[triangulated categories]]) such that the following conditions hold (see [Cisinski-Déglise, around p. x](#CisinskiDeglise)):

1. for every [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ it assigns a ([[inverse image]] $\dashv$ [[direct image]]) [[adjunction]] $(f^* \dashv f_*) : D(X) \to D(Y)$ which extends to a  [[six operations]] formalism $(f_! \dashv f^!) : D(X) \to D(Y)$ if $f$ is a [[separated morphism]] of finite type;

1. for every [[closed immersion]] $i \colon Z \hookrightarrow X$ with open immersion complement $j \colon (X-Z) \hookrightarrow X$ the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]/[[counits]] form a ([[cofiber sequence|co]])[[fiber sequence]]

   $$
     j_! j^! \to 1 \to i_* i^* 
   $$

1. the functor is [[homotopy]]-invariant in the sense that for any $X \in \mathcal{D}$, with $\mathbb{A}^1$-the [[line object]] (the [[affine line]]), the [[inverse image]] $D(p)^*$ along the [[projection]] $p \colon \mathbb{A}^1 \times X \to X$ is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] (??? check ??? we want to say that the composite of taking the product with $\mathbb{A}^1$ and then forgetting the map to $\mathbb{A}^1$ is an equivalence).

1. some further technical conditions ...

The idea here is that one wants to think of $D(X)$ as a subcategory of the [[derived category]] $\mathcal{D}(X)$ of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on those that serve as certain nice [[coefficients]] for [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] (for instance in that they exhibit nice gluing over open immersions, give homotopy-invariant cohomology groups etc.)

Then (with the list of such axioms suitably completed) we want to say that:

**Idea of Definition.**
 
1. The [[initial object]] -- to be denoted $SH$ -- in the evident [[(∞,2)-category]] of such functors $D$ is the **motive** (or the "motive functor" or the like).

1. For every $X \in \mathcal{C}$ the exceptional direct image $p_#(1) \in SH(Spec k)$ of the tensor unit under the projection $X \to Spec k$ to the base space is **the motive of $X$**.

**Idea of one central theorem.** The assignment that sends $X \in \mathcal{C}$ to the stable [[A1-homotopy theory]] over $X$ is such an initial object.

(Warning: apparently the full initiality has not been shown yet, but it has been shown that there is a morphism from this $DM$ to any other $D$ which seems to be essentially unique in the right sense). 


## Constructions of the abelian category of mixed motives {#AbelianMotives}

There is no generally accepted construction of a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear [[abelian category]] of mixed motives, and its existence remains conjectural. However, there exist candidate and conditional constructions which are useful in practice.

Note that "the" abelian category of mixed motives depends on choosing a base [[scheme]] $S$, and one speaks of motives (or _motivic sheaves_) over $S$. Traditionally, $S$ is the spectrum of a [[field]], often of characteristic zero.


### Nori motives

[[Madhav Nori]] has an approach to the theory of motives based on a peculiar kind of Tannakian reconstruction, the so called _[[Nori's Tannakian theorem]]_. Nori's construction unconditionally produces a $\mathbb{Q}$-[[Tannakian category]] of mixed motives over any sub[[field]] of $\mathbb{C}$.

### As the heart of a t-structure on the derived category of mixed motives

Deligne first suggested that it might be easier to define the [[derived category]] $DM(S,\mathbb{Q})$ of the hypothetical abelian category of mixed motives. Once this is done, one can in principle recover the abelian category as the heart of a [[t-structure]] on $DM(S,\mathbb{Q})$. It is now well-understood what the [[triangulated category]] $DM(S,\mathbb{Q})$ is over any base [[scheme]] ([see below](#DerivedMotives)). The hypothetical t-structure on $DM(S,\mathbb{Q})$ whose heart is the abelian category of mixed motives over $S$ is called the **motivic t-structure**.

Beilinson proved that, over fields of characteristic zero, the existence of the motivic t-structure implies the [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]] (see [Beilinson](#Beilinson10)), and Bondarko proved that it implies the existence of motivic t-structures for more general schemes (see [Bondarko](#Bondarko13)).

While the derived category of mixed motives can also be defined with integral rather than rational coefficients, Voevodksy observed that the derived category of integral motives cannot have a motivic t-structure ([Voevodsky, Prop. 4.3.8](#TriCatMixMot)). Thus, the _abelian_ category of motives always refers to motives with rational coefficients.

## Constructions of the derived category of mixed motives {#DerivedMotives}

The [[derived category]] of the hypothetical abelian category of mixed motives has been unconditionally defined over any [[Noetherian scheme]]. The first definition was proposed by Voevodsky in the mid 1990s. Since then, several other definitions were formulated: one by Morel, one by Ayoub, and one by Cisinski and Déglise. The latter three are equivalent and support a full-fledged formalism of [[six operations]]. However, they are only known to be equivalent to Voevodsky's definition over [[excellent scheme|excellent]] and [[geometrically unibranch scheme|geometrically unibranch]] schemes.

On the other hand, Voevodsky's definition is the only one among these four which also makes sense with integral coefficients rather than rational coefficients. Recently, Spitzweck proposed a definition of the category of integral motives over general base schemes which also supports a formalism of [[six operations]]. It is known to agree with Voevodsky's definition for [[fields]] of characteristic zero. Rationally, however, it agrees with the Morel/Ayoub/Cisinski-Déglise definition over any equicharacteristic scheme.


### As homotopy invariant Nisnevich sheaves with transfers (Voevodsky motives)

Associated to a [[Noetherian scheme]] $S$ there is an [[additive category]] $SmCor_S$ of "finite" [[correspondence]]s of [[scheme]]s, whose

* [[object]]s are smooth schemes of finite type over $S$;

* [[morphism]]s $SmCor_S(X,Y)$ are the abelian group of cycles on the [[fiber product]] $X \times_S Y$ that are "universally integral relative to $X$" and each of whose components are finite and and surjective over $X$.

Details are in [MaVoWe, Appendix 1A](#MaVoWe). Associating to a morphism of schemes its graph defines a [[faithful functor]] $Sm/S\hookrightarrow SmCor_S$.

An **(∞,1)-presheaf with transfers** on the category $Sm/S$ of smooth schemes of finite type is an [[(∞,1)-presheaf]] on $SmCor_S$ which transforms finite sums into finite (∞,1)-products (and hence take values in connective [[chain complexes]]).

The (∞,1)-category $DM^{eff}_{\geq 0}(S)$ is a certain [[localization]] of the (∞,1)-category of presheaves with transfers: it consists of those presheaves with transfers whose underlying presheaves on $Sm/S$ are [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] for the [[Nisnevich topology]] and are $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariant. 

The **Tate motive** $\mathbb{Z}(1)[2]$ is the image of the pointed scheme $(\mathbb{P}^1,\infty)$ in $DM^{eff}_{\geq 0}(S)$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
The stable (∞,1)-category of (integral) motives $DM(S)$ is the [[stabilization]] of $DM^{eff}_{\geq 0}(S)$ at the Tate motive $\mathbb{Z}(1)[2]$.
=--

The (∞,1)-category $DM(S)$ is a [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]], [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]], and [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] (∞,1)-category which is [[enriched category|enriched]] in [[chain complexes]]. It is slightly larger than the category $DM^-(S)$ defined in [MaVoWe, p. 110](#MaVoWe) which is not cocomplete.

_Voevodsky's cancellation theorem_ states that the canonical functor $DM^{eff}_{\geq 0}(S)\to DM(S)$ is [[fully faithful]] if $S$ is a [[perfect field]].

### As rational stable motivic homotopy types with trivial action of the Hopf element (Morel motives)

Let $\epsilon : \mathbb{G}_m\wedge \mathbb{G}_m\to \mathbb{G}_m\wedge \mathbb{G}_m$ be the transposition. In the [[stable motivic homotopy category]] $SH(S)$ this becomes an endomorphism of the motivic sphere spectrum $S^0$ such that $\epsilon^2=1$. Rationally (or even away from 2), we obtain a pair of idempotent elements

$$ \frac{1+\epsilon}{2}, \quad \frac{1-\epsilon}{2} $$

which induce a splitting $SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}}\simeq SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}_+}\times SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}_-}$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
$SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}_+}$ is the stable $(\infty,1)$-category of _Morel motives_.
=--

In other words, a Morel motive is a rational stable motivic homotopy type over which $\epsilon$ acts as $-1$.

The *Hopf element* $\eta\in \pi_{1,1}(S^0)$ is the stabilization of the algebraic [[Hopf fibration]] $\mathbb{A}^2-0\to\mathbb{P}^1$ over $S$. Morel motives can also be characterized as those rational stable motivic homotopy types that are acted on trivially by the Hopf element.

We have $\epsilon=-1$ if and only if $-1$ is a sum of squares in all the residue fields of $S$; in this case we therefore have $SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}}= SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}_+}$. Thus, the other summand $SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}_-}$ only appears over [[formally real field]]s. It is called the category of _Witt motives_.


### As homotopy invariant étale sheaves without transfers (Ayoub motives)

According to Ayoub, the stable $(\infty,1)$-category of motives over a scheme $S$ can be constructed in the same way as the stable motivic homotopy category $SH(S)$, with two variations:

* Instead of the [[Nisnevich topology]] on the category of smooth $S$-schemes, use the [[étale topology]]
* Instead of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] of [[∞-groupoids]], use (∞,1)-sheaves of connective [[chain complexes]] of $\mathbb{Q}$-[[vector spaces]].

The resulting (∞,1)-category is denoted $DA^{\mathrm{et}}(S,\mathbb{Q})$. Its objects are thus $\mathbb{P}^1$-spectra of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant étale [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] with values in connective rational [[chain complexes]].

### As modules over a summand of rational homotopy invariant algebraic K-theory (Beilinson motives)

This definition is due to Cisinski and Déglise. The rationalization of the homotopy invariant [[algebraic K-theory]] spectrum $KGL\in SH(S)$ splits as a direct sum

$$ KGL_{\mathbb{Q}} = \bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \Sigma_T^n H_B $$

for some $E_\infty$ rational motivic ring spectrum $H_B\in SH(S)$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
The stable $(\infty,1)$-category of _Beilinson motives_ is the $(\infty,1)$-category of [[module]]s over $H_B$. Equivalently, it is the full subcategory of $SH(S)_{\mathbb{Q}}$ consisting of $H_B$-local objects.
=--

Cisinski and Déglise have shown that $H_B$ is the exactly $+$-summand $S^0_{\mathbb{Q}_+}$ of the rational motivic sphere spectrum, and hence that a Beilinson motive is the same thing as a Morel motive. They have also shown that Beilison/Morel motives are equivalent to Ayoub motives. Finally, they have shown that Beilinson motives are equivalent to rational Voevodsky motives $DM(S,\mathbb{Q})$ when $S$ is [[excellent scheme|excellent]] and [[geometrically unibranch scheme|geometrically unibranch]]. Over such schemes, all four definitions of the derived category of mixed motives are therefore equivalent.

### As modules over a spectrum representing motivic cohomology over $Spec \mathbb{Z}$ (Spitzweck motives)

One idea to define a category of integral motives with a formalism of [[six operations]] is to first define an $E_\infty$ motivic ring spectrum $M_{\mathbb{Z}}\in SH(Spec \mathbb{Z})$. If $f: S\to Spec \mathbb{Z}$ is any scheme, we obtain an $E_\infty$-algebra $M_S = f^\ast(M_{\mathbb{Z}})$ in $SH(S)$. The categories of modules over $M_S$ for varying $S$ then inherit a complete formalism of six operations from $SH$.

Spitweck defined such an $E_\infty$-algebra $M_{\mathbb{Z}}$ such that

* if $S$ is smooth over a [[Dedekind domain]], $M_S$ represents [[motivic cohomology|Bloch–Levine motivic cohomology]],
* if $S$ is smooth over a field, $M_S$ is equivalent to Voevodsky's motivic Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum $H\mathbb{Z}$.

The stable $(\infty,1)$-category of $M_S$-modules is thus a well-behaved candidate for a derived category of integral motives, but it is only known to agree with Voevodsky's definition when $S$ is a field of characteristic zero (by [Rondigs-Ostvaer, Theorem 5.5](#RO08)).

## Variations and extensions

Correspondences are interesting in [[noncommutative geometry]] of the [[operator algebra]] flavour. For example, KK-groups are in fact themselves sort of correspondences; Connes and Skandalis had an early reference very much paralleling some ideas from the algebraic world. More recently, motives in the operator algebraic setup have been approached by Connes, Marcolli and others. 

In derived [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] based on $A_\infty$-categories, Kontsevich proposed a theory of [[noncommutative motive]]s. There is now already a more general setup (than Kontsevich's) due Cisinski and Tabuada (see Refs.).

In [[birational geometry]], Bruno Kahn defined the appropriate version. In [[rigid analytic geometry]], $A^1$-homotopy theory is replaced by $B^1$-homotopy theory and the appropriate analogue of the Voevodsky's category of mixed motives has been constructed; the construction follows the same basic pattern.
