### Informal idea
 {#InformalIdea}

> In order to express this kinship of these different cohomological theories, I formulated the notion of “motive” associated to an algebraic variety. By this term I want to suggest that it is the “common motive” (or “common reason”) behind this multitude of cohomological invariants attached to an algebraic variety, or indeed, behind all cohomological invariants that are a priori possible. ([[Grothendieck]], [[Recoltes et Semailles]])

The similarity of the behaviour of various [[cohomologies]] of [[algebraic variety|varieties]] over a [[field]] suggests that there is a universal one among them with values in an intermediate [[abelian category]], called the _[[category]] of motives_. The idea is that for every variety $X$, there is a motive $M(X)$ and good [[cohomology theories]] would factor through the projection. (Here not every motive is supposed to be the image of a single variety.)

[[Grothendieck]]'s original realization of this idea is the [[category of Chow motives]], which is a certain abelianization and completion of a [[category of spans]] of [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]]. Later a more [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] version was given, the [[Voevodsky motives]] or _derived motives_, see [below](#IdeaOfAbstractDefinition), which subsume the Chow motives faithfully. More generally still, there are definitions for _[[noncommutative motives]]_ obtained by passing to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

Finally the construction principle of motives can also be adapted to other flavors of [[geometry]]. For instance in [[noncommutative topology]] the role of the category of [[noncommutative motives]] is played by [[KK-theory]]. 

One distinguishes a theory of [[pure motives]] from a version with further filtrations, the [[mixed motives]]. 
So far there are realizations of [[pure motives]], and not of the mixed motives. However there are several equivalent definitions of a [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[tensor category]] which has all conjectured structural properties of the derived category of mixed motives (except t-structure which would manifestly make it a derived category); hence it is denoted $D(\mathcal{M M})$.

Constructions of motives depend much on whether we work in prime [[characteristic]]s or in characteristic zero. Part of the formalism involves more general [[schemes]] than varieties. 

Another crucial idea leading to motives is that the various cohomologies lead to the same pieces of information; therefore there is a symmetry related to this, which is of [[Galois theory]] nature. For example, over the [[complex numbers]] one can compare the [[Betti cohomology]] and [[de Rham cohomology]] "realizations". Thus one has a  [[motivic Galois group]], and as usually with representations one has a [[tensor category]] structure which is also [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]]. Thus one has in fact an [[abelian category|abelian]] [[tensor category]] of motives. [[Tannakian reconstruction]] plays a major role; for pure motives we have neutral [[Tannakian category|Tannakian categories]], and for mixed motives we have mixed Tannakian categories. Functions on the [[torsor]] of the isomorphism between "realizations" correspond to the matrices of [[period]]s in [[Hodge theory]]. 

$L$-functions (and $\zeta$-functions in particular) of varieties are also invariants of their motives. The [[Langlands program]] indirectly involves motives; in particular its essential part can be expressed as a general modularity conjecture relating $L$-functions to automorphic functions. Most of the deep properties of [[elliptic curve]]s are of motivic nature, and in particular a major step of the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] by Wiles and Taylor can be interpreted as a proof of a special case of the modularity conjecture (for elliptic curves). 

### Idea of the precise abstract definition of derived motives
 {#IdeaOfAbstractDefinition}

We indicate the simple idea of the formal general abstract definition of derived mixed motives, as originally indicated in [Deligne's transcript of Voevodsky's lectures](#Deligne) and then elaborated on by ([Ayoub](#Ayoub)). We follow the introduction of ([Cisinski-Déglise](#CisinskiDeglise)).

On some [[site]] $\mathcal{C}$ of ([[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich]]) [[schemes]] (or maybe some other kinds of [[spaces]]), consider [[functors]] (or maybe rather [[(∞,1)-functors]])

$$
  D \colon \mathcal{C} \to Stab\infty Cat
$$

with values in [[closed monoidal (∞,1)-category|closed monoidal]] [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] (or some presentation theoreof, such as suitably [[enhanced triangulated category|enhanced]] [[triangulated categories]]) such that the following conditions hold (see [Cisinski-Déglise, around p. x](#CisinskiDeglise)):

1. for every [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ it assigns a ([[inverse image]] $\dashv$ [[direct image]]) [[adjunction]] $(f^* \dashv f_*) : D(X) \to D(Y)$ which extends to a  [[six operations]] formalism $(f_! \dashv f^!) : D(X) \to D(Y)$ if $f$ is a [[separated morphism]] of finite type;

1. for every [[closed immersion]] $i \colon Z \hookrightarrow X$ with open immersion complement $j \colon (X-Z) \hookrightarrow X$ the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]/[[counits]] form a ([[cofiber sequence|co]])[[fiber sequence]]

   $$
     j_! j^! \to 1 \to i_* i^* 
   $$

1. the functor is [[homotopy]]-invariant in the sense that for any $X \in \mathcal{D}$, with $\mathbb{A}^1$-the [[line object]] (the [[affine line]]), the [[inverse image]] $D(p)^*$ along the [[projection]] $p \colon \mathbb{A}^1 \times X \to X$ is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] (??? check ??? we want to say that the composite of taking the product with $\mathbb{A}^1$ and then forgetting the map to $\mathbb{A}^1$ is an equivalence).

1. some further technical conditions ...

The idea here is that one wants to think of $D(X)$ as a subcategory of the [[derived category]] $\mathcal{D}(X)$ of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on those that serve as certain nice [[coefficients]] for [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] (for instance in that they exhibit nice gluing over open immersions, give homotopy-invariant cohomology groups etc.)

Then (with the list of such axioms suitably completed) we want to say that:

**Idea of Definition.**
 
1. The [[initial object]] -- to be denoted $SH$ -- in the evident [[(∞,2)-category]] of such functors $D$ is the **motive** (or the "motive functor" or the like).

1. For every $X \in \mathcal{C}$ the exceptional direct image $p_#(1) \in SH(Spec k)$ of the tensor unit under the projection $X \to Spec k$ to the base space is **the motive of $X$**.

**Idea of one central theorem.** The assignment that sends $X \in \mathcal{C}$ to the stable [[A1-homotopy theory]] over $X$ is such an initial object.

(Warning: apparently the full initiality has not been shown yet, but it has been shown that there is a morphism from this $DM$ to any other $D$ which seems to be essentially unique in the right sense). 





## Constructions

### Voevodsky motives

Associated to a [[Noetherian scheme]] $S$ there is a [[category]] $Cor_S$ of "finite" [[correspondence]]s of [[scheme]]s, whose

* [[object]]s are schemes of finite type over $S$;

* [[morphism]]s $Cor_S(X,Y)$ form an abelian group of cycles on the [[fiber product]] $X \times_S Y$ that are "universally integral relative to $X$" and each of whose components are finite and and surjective over $X$.

Details are in [appendix 1A](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=19) of [MaVoWe](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html).

The [[triangulated category]] of **motives** over a [[field]] $k$ is... 

...defined for instance in [lecture 14, def 14.1](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=121) of [MaVoWe](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html).

It is a [[localization]] of the [[derived category]] of (bounded) complexes of sheaves on this category of correspondences, $Cor_S$.


### Motivic cohomology

The derived [[hom-set]]s in the category of motives, at least between special objects, compute what is called [[motivic cohomology]].

See [prop. 14.16, p. 114](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=126) of [MaVoWe](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html).


### Nori motives

[[Madhav Nori]] has an approach to the theory of motives based on a peculiar kind of Tannakian reconstruction, the so called _[[Nori's Tannakian theorem]]_. 

### Extensions

Correspondences are interesting in [[noncommutative geometry]] of the [[operator algebra]] flavour. For example, KK-groups are in fact themselves sort of correspondences; Connes and Skandalis had an early reference very much paralleling some ideas from the algebraic world. More recently, motives in the operator algebraic setup have been approached by Connes, Marcolli and others. 

In derived [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] based on $A_\infty$-categories, Kontsevich proposed a theory of [[noncommutative motive]]s. There is now already a more general setup (than Kontsevich's) due Cisinski and Tabuada (see Refs.).

In [[birational geometry]], Bruno Kahn defined the appropriate version. In [[rigid analytic geometry]], $A^1$-homotopy theory is replaced by $B^1$-homotopy theory and the appropriate analogue of the Voevodsky's category of mixed motives has been constructed; the construction follows the same basic pattern.
