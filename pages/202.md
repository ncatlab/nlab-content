_Grp_ is the [[category]] with [[group|groups]] as [[object|objects]] and group homomorphisms as [[morphism]]s.

More abstractly, we can think of $Grp$ as the [[full subcategory]] of $Cat$ with groups as objects.

#Remarks#

Since groups may be identified with one-object [[groupoid]]s, it is sometimes useful to regard Grp as a 2-category, namely as the full 2-category of $Groupoids \subset Cat$ on one-object groupoids. In this case the 2-morphisms between morphisms of groups come from "intertwiners": inner automorphisms of the target group.

Precisely analogous statements hold for the category [[Alg]] of algebras.
