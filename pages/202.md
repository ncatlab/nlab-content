## Definition

__$Grp$__ is the [[category]] with [[group|groups]] as [[objects]] and [[group homomorphisms]] as [[morphisms]].

Similarly there there is the [[full subcategory]] $FinGrp \hookrightarrow Grp$ of [[finite groups]].

More generally, if $\mathcal{C}$ is any [[category]] with [[finite products]], there is a [[category]] $Grp(\mathcal{C})$ of [[group objects]] in $\mathcal{C}$. This category if [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category $Prod(T_{Grp}, \mathcal{C})$ of product-preserving functors from the [[Lawvere theory]] for groups to $\mathcal{C}$.  For instance for $\mathcal{C} = $ [[SmthMfd]] this yields the category of [[Lie groups]]; while for $\mathcal{C} = $ [[Set]] it reduces again to the default case.


##Remarks##

If one associates to a group $G$ its [[delooping]] one-object [[groupoid]] $B G$, it is sometimes of interest to regard the collection of groups instead as a [[2-category]], namely as the [[full subcategory|full]] sub-$2$-category of [[Grpd]] on one-object groupoids. In this case the $2$-morphisms between homomorphisms of groups come from "intertwiners": [[inner automorphism]]s of the target group -- hence this 2-category is _not_ equivalent to the 1-category of groups.

On the other hand, if we regard $Grp$ as a full sub-$2$-category of $Grpd_*$, the $2$-category of *[[pointed object|pointed]]* groupoids, then this is [[locally discrete 2-category|locally discrete]] and [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the ordinary [[1-category]] $Grp$.  This is because the only *pointed* intertwiner between two homomorphisms is the identity.

Precisely analogous statements hold for the category [[Alg]] of algebras.

## Properties 

(In this section, all statements about $Grp$ are valid more generally for $Grp(E)$ where $E$ is a [[topos]] with a [[natural numbers object]].) 

The category $Grp$ is one of the prototypical examples of a [[semiabelian category]], and so enjoys some nice properties. For example, it is [[regular category|regular]] and even [[Barr-exact category|exact]], and [[protomodular category|protomodular]] so that one can expect a certain battery of [diagram chasing lemmas](/nlab/show/diagram+chasing+lemmas+-+contents) to hold in it. 

The category of groups is also [[balanced category|balanced]]. This follows from a somewhat remarkable theorem:

###### Theorem 
Every [[monomorphism]] in $Grp$ is an [[equalizer]]. 
=-- 

The proofs most commonly seen in the literature are elementary but nonconstructive; a typical example may be found [here](/nlab/show/regular+monomorphism#grpreg) at [[regular monomorphism]]. Here we give a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] proof. 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $i: H \to G$ be monic, and let $\pi: G \to G/H$ be the canonical [[surjective function]] $g \mapsto g H$. Let $A$ be the [[free object|free]] [[abelian group]] on $G/H$ with $j: G/H \to A$ the canonical injection, and let $A^G$ denote the set of functions $f: G \to A$, with the pointwise abelian group structure inherited from $A$. This carries a $G$-[[module]] structure defined by 

$$(g \cdot f)(g') = f(g' g).$$ 

For any $f \in A^G$, the function $d_f: G \to A^G$ defined by $d_f(g) = g f - f$ defines a [[derivation]], i.e., a map satisfying the equation $d_f(g g') = g d_f(g') + d_f(g)$. Consider now the wreath product, i.e., the [[semidirect product]] $A^G \rtimes G$, where the multiplication is defined by $(f, g) \cdot (f', g') = (g f' + f, g g')$. By the derivation equation, we have a homomorphism $\phi: G \to A^G \rtimes G$ defined by $\phi(g) \coloneqq (d_{j \pi}(g), g)$, and there is a second homomorphism $\psi: G \to A^G \rtimes G$ defined by $\psi(g) \coloneqq (0, g)$. We claim that $i: H \to G$ is the equalizer of the pair $\phi, \psi$. For, 

$$\array{ 
d_{j\pi}(g) = 0 & \text{iff} & (\forall_{g': G})\; g\cdot j\pi(g') = j\pi(g') \\ 
 & \text{iff} & (\forall_{g': G})\; j\pi(g' g) = j\pi(g') \\ 
 & \text{iff} & (\forall_{g': G})\; j(g' g H) = j(g' H) \\ 
 & \text{iff} & (\forall_{g': G})\; g' g H = g' H \\ 
 & \text{iff} & g H = H \\ 
 & \text{iff} & g \in H. 
}$$ 

(All we needed was *some* injection $j: G/H \to A$ into an abelian group; embedding into the free abelian group is a pretty canonical choice.)

###### Remark 
This proof can be adapted to show that monomorphisms in the category of [[finite set|finite]] groups (group objects in $FinSet$) are also equalizers. All that needs to be modified is the choice of $A$, which we could take to be a free $\mathbb{F}_2$-[[vector space]] generated by $G/H$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
The proof requires that the [[monad|unit]] $X \to U F X$ of the free abelian group monad (or the free $\mathbb{F}_2$ vector space monad) is monic, constructively. This is not entirely obvious, and is not a well-known fact, but details can be found in this [MO thread](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/302516/constructively-is-the-unit-of-the-free-abelian-group-monad-on-sets-injective/302519).

###### Corollary 
The category of groups is [[balanced category|balanced]]: every [[epimorphism|epic]] mono is an [[isomorphism]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
This follows because an epic equalizer is an equalizer of two maps that (by epi-ness) must be the same, hence the equalizer is an isomorphism. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_cor} 
###### Corollary 
Every epimorphism in the category of groups is a coequalizer. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Since every morphism $f: G \to H$ factors as a *regular* epi $p: G \to G/\ker(f)$ followed by a mono $i$, having $f$ epi implies $i$ is a epic mono. Epic monos $i$ being isomorphisms, $f$ is then forced to be regular epic as well. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
Despite the fact that every morphism in $Grp$ factors as an epi followed by a regular mono, it is not true that $Grp^{op}$ is regular. Indeed, (regular) monos are in $Grp$ not stable under pushouts. This follows essentially from the plenitude of [[simple objects]] in $Grp$: if $H$ is not simple but embeds in a simple group $G$, then there is a nontrivial quotient $H \to H/N$, and in the pushout diagram 

$$\array{
H & \hookrightarrow & G \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\ 
H/N & \to & P
}$$ 

the object $P$ will be a proper quotient of $G$ and therefore $P \cong 1$, so that the pushout of the mono $H \to G$ which is $H/N \to 1$ fails to be mono.
