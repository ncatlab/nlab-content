Measurable spaces are used in the general theory of measure and integration, somewhat analogous to the role played by topological spaces in the study of continuity. 

## Definitions ## 

A **measurable space** is a set $X$ equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$, meaning a collection of subsets $S \subseteq X$ which is closed under countable unions and under complementation in the power set $P X$. The elements of the $\Sigma$ are called **measurable subsets** of $X$. 

If $X$ is a topological space, the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebras which contain the topology on $X$ is again a $\sigma$-algebra, whose elements are called **Borel sets** of $X$. 

Given measurable spaces $X$ and $Y$, a function $f: X \to Y$ is **measurable** if the inverse image $f^{-1}(T)$ is measurable in $X$ whenever $T$ is measurable in $Y$. A measurable function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is generally taken to refer to Borel sets in $\mathbb{R}$ (with respect to the standard topology); there $f$ is measurable if $f^{-1}(U)$ is measurable whenever $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open. Similarly if $\mathbb{R}$ is replaced by the space of extended reals $[-\infty, \infty]$, or by the space of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. 

## Measure spaces ##

Measurable spaces are called such because one usually goes on to define **measures** on them.  See [[measure space]].
