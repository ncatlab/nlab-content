&gt; Not to be confused with [[George Whitehead]], who also worked in [[algebraic topology]].

## Contributions

His contributions to [[mathematics]] include the following:

* [[CW complexes]]; these were introduced in his papers on

* [[combinatorial homotopy]], which in turn were one prime  source of inspiration for [[Ronnie Brown|Brown]], [[Higgins]] and Sivera's, [[Nonabelian Algebraic Topology]] and also for Baues' extensive work on, for instance, [[Combinatorial Homotopy and 4-Dimensional Complexes]];

* [[simple homotopy theory]];

* the [[Whitehead group]] which is a precursor of constructions in algebraic K-theory;

* with [[Saunders Mac Lane]], first characterisation of [[homotopy 2-types]].

* founder of the [[algebraic homotopy]] programme;

* [[Whitehead product]]

* [[Whitehead theorem]]

* he introduced [[crossed modules]]
