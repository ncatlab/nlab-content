John Henry Constantine Whitehead (11 November 1904–8 May 1960), was one of the founders of modern [[algebraic topology]]. His contributions include

 * [[CW complexes]]; these were introduced in his papers on

 * [[combinatorial homotopy]], which in turn were one prime  source of inspiration for [[Ronnie Brown|Brown]], [[Higgins]] and Sivera's, [[Nonabelian Algebraic Topology]] and also for Baues' extensive work on, for instance, [[Combinatorial Homotopy and 4-Dimensional Complexes]];

 * [[simple homotopy theory]];

 * the [[Whitehead group]] which is a precursor of constructions in algebraic K-theory;

 * with [[Saunders Mac Lane]], first characterisation of homotopy 2-types.

 * founder of the [[algebraic homotopy]] programme;

 * one of the founders of the influential journal _Topology_.
