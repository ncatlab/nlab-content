## Definition ##

An [[object]] $X$ of a [[category]] is **small** if it is $\kappa$-[[compact object|compact]] for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ (and therefore also for all greater regular cardinals as well). 

Here, $X$ is called $\kappa$-compact if the [[representable functor|corepresentable functor]] $hom(X,\cdot)$ preserves $\kappa$-[[filtered category|filtered]] colimits.

## Examples and applications ##

* In a [[locally presentable category]] every object is a [[colimit]] over small objects.

* Smallness of objects plays a crucial role in the [[small object argument]].
