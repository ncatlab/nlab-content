## Definition

A **Stonean space** is a [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[extremally disconnected]] [[topological space]].
Stonean spaces form a [[category]] if we take [[continuous function|continuous]] [[open maps]]
as [[morphisms]].

Thus, the category of Stonean spaces is a (nonfull)
[[subcategory]] of the category of [[Stone spaces]] and [[continuous maps]].

In presence of the [[axiom of choice]],
as a consequence of [[Stone duality]], the [[category]] of Stonean spaces is contravariantly [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category
of [[complete Boolean algebras]] and continuous homomorphisms.
This statement is known as the __Stonean duality__.

Without the [[axiom of choice]],
the [[category]] of [[Stonean locales]] is contravariantly [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category
of [[complete Boolean algebras]] and continuous homomorphisms.
See the article [[Stonean locale]] for more information.
