[[!redirects Lawverian formalization of Hegelian metaphysics]]



**Abstract** While [[analytic philosophy]] famously rejected the
speculative [[metaphysics]] of [[Hegel]] in favor of the analysis of concepts by means of [[mathematical logic]], in particular [[predicate logic]], recent developments in the [[foundations of mathematics]]  via [[homotopy type theory]] offer a way to re-read [[Hegel]] as having useful formal meaning not in predicate logic, but in '[[modal type theory]]'. The essence of this suggestion has been made by [[Lawvere]] in 1991, which however remains largely unnoticed. Here we aim to give a transparent account of this perspective both philosophically as well as [[category theory|category-theoretically]]. We then further expand on
Lawvere's formalization of Hegel's "[[Science of Logic]]" in terms of the [[categorical semantics]] given by [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive higher toposes]]. We discuss how there is a _useful_ formalization of a fair bit of modern fundamental [[physics]], in fact of [[quantum field theory]], to be found here.

## Introduction

(...)

Despite the initial rejection of Hegelian ideas by analytic philosophy, there have recently been increasing signs of a willingness to re-engage with Hegel's writings, in particular on the part of John MacDowell and Robert Brandom (Redding, 2007). One feature of analytic philosophy which needs reconsidering according to Redding is the primacy of first-order predicate logic.
