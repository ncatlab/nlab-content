mystical [[metaphysics]] of [[Hegel]] in favor of clear [[mathematical logic]], recent developments in the [[foundations of
mathematics]]  via [[homotopy type theory]] offer a way to re-read [[Hegel]] as having useful formal meaning not in [[predicate logic]], but in '[[modal type theory|modal homotopy type theory]]'. The essence of this suggestion has been made by [[Lawvere]] in 1991, which however remains largely unnoticed. Here we aim to give a transparent account of this perspective both philosophically as well as [[category theory|category-theoretically]]. We then further expand on
Lawvere's formalization of Hegel's "logic" in terms of the [[categorical semantics]] given by [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive higher toposes]] and discuss how there is a useful formalization of a fair bit of modern
[[physics]], in fact of [[quantum field theory]], to be found here.
