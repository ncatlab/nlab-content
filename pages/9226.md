## Idea

Given a [[local action functional]] on [[field (physics)|fields]] which are [[sections]] of a suitable [[field bundle]], [[perturbation theory]] and [[renormalization]] allow to assign to [[open subsets]] of [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] the corresponding [[quantum BV-complexes]]/[[Beilinson-Drinfeld algebras]]. This assignment is canonically equipped with the structure of a [[factorization algebra]], the _factorization algebra of observables_ of the [[theory (physics)|theory]].

This formalization of [[algebraic quantum field theory]] is similar to, but a bit different from, the notion of _[[local net of observables]]_.

## Examples

* Over a Riemann surface: [[vertex operator algebra]] ([Gwilliam, section 6.3, section 6.5](#Gwilliam))

* (...)
