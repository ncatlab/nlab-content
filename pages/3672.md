## Idea

There is a close relationship between 

* the four [[normed division algebras]] 

* [[spin geometry]], 

* the [[Lie algebra cohomology]] of the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]], 

* and [[supersymmetry]] in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]].


This is based on the fact that in certain dimensions, [[spin group]] [[representation]]s are naturally identified with a $\mathbb{K}^n$, for $\mathbb{K}$ one of the [[normed division algebra]]s.

...


## Applications 

The structure of the [[normed division algebra]]s governs the existence of super-[[∞-Lie algebra]]s such as the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]. By the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] the [[∞-Lie algebra valued forms]] with values in these constitute the field content of (11-dimensional) [[supergravity]].
