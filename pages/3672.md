## Idea

There is a close relationship between 

* the four [[normed division algebras]] 

* [[spin geometry]], 

* the [[Lie algebra cohomology]] of the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]], 

* and [[supersymmetry]] in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]].


This is based on the fact that in certain dimensions, [[spin group]] [[representation]]s are naturally identified with a $\mathbb{K}^n$, for $\mathbb{K}$ one of the [[normed division algebra]]s.
