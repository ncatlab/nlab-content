## Definition

###### Definition

For $(X,\omega)$ a ([[pre-symplectic form|pre]]-)[[symplectic manifold]] such that $\omega$ is an [[integral form]], a **prequantum line bundle** is any [[line bundle]] $P \to X$ with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ on $X$ such that 

$$
  \omega = F_\nabla
$$

is the [[curvature]] 2-form of $\nabla$.

###### Remark

Choosing a prequantum line bundle is the first step in the [[geometric quantization]] of $(X, \omega)$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


In [[cohomology]], a choice of prequantum line bundle corresponds to a lift from [[curvature]] 2-forms to [[ordinary differential cohomology]] $H^2(X)_{diff}$ through the [[curvature]] projection

$$
  H^2(X)_{diff} \stackrel{F}{\to} \Omega^2_{int}(X)
  \,.
$$

The above definition has an immediate generalization to [[n-plectic geometry]].

###### Definition

For $(X,\omega)$ an [[n-plectic manifold]] such that $\omega$ is an [[integral form]], a **prequantum circle n- bundle** is any [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $(P \to X, \nabla)$  such that 

$$
  \omega = F_\nabla
$$

is the [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form of $\nabla$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


In [[cohomology]], a choice of prequantum circle $n$-bundle corresponds to a lift from [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-forms to [[ordinary differential cohomology]] $H^{n+1}(X)_{diff}$ through the [[curvature]] projection

$$
  H^{n+1}(X)_{diff} \stackrel{F}{\to} \Omega^{n+1}_{int}(X)
  \,.
