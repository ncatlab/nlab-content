## Definition

A [[full subcategory|full]] [[triangulated subcategory]] is __thick__ (or __épaisse__) if it is closed under [[extension]]s. 

Sometimes the same definition is used in [[abelian categories]] as well. However, for many authors, including [[Pierre Gabriel]], in abelian categories, this term denotes the stronger notion of a [[topologizing subcategory]] closed under extensions; in other words, a nonempty full subcategory $T$ of an abelian category $A$ is  __thick__ (in the strong sense) iff with all objects contains all its subquotients and all extensions, i.e. for every exact sequence 
$$
0 \longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M''\longrightarrow M'\longrightarrow 0
$$
in $A$, the object $M''$ is in $T$ iff $M$ and $M'$ are in $T$.

For some authors the thick subcategory (strong version) is called a [[Serre subcategory]] (in a weak sense), the term which we reserve for (generally) a stronger notion. 

For any subcategory of an abelian category $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which any (nonzero) [[subquotient]] of $N$ in $T$
has a (nonzero) [[subobject]] from $T$. This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ where $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].
Moreover $\bar{T}$ is always thick in the stronger sense.
[[Serre subcategory|Serre subcategories]] in the strong sense are those (nonempty) subcategories which are stable under the operation $T\mapsto\bar{T}$.

## Serre quotient category

Following the extensions of an early work of Serre by Grothendieck and Gabriel, for a thick subcategory $T$ in an abelian category $A$, one defines the (Serre) quotient category $A/T$ has the same objects as $T$ and 

$$
(A/T)(X,Y) := colim A(X',Y/Y')
$$

where the colimit runs through all subobjects $X'\subset X$, $Y'\subset Y$ such that $X/X' \in Ob T$, $Y'\in Ob T$. The quotient functor $Q: A\to A/T$ is obvious. 

Notice that the set of morphisms is small, so that the
Serre quotient category exists. On the other hand, one can
construct an equivalent localization by the Gabriel-Zisman 
localizing at the class $\Sigma$ of all morphisms
whose kernel and cokernel are in $T$. Although 
$\Sigma$ admits the [[calculus of fractions]], 
this method does not guarantee the existence in general. 

### Localizing subcategories

A thick subcategory (here always in strong sense) is said to be [[localizing subcategory|localizing]] if and $Q$ admits a right adjoint $A/T\to A$, often called the __section functor__. In other words $A/T$ is a reflective subcategory of $A$. Every coreflective thick subcategory $T$ admits a section functor, and the converse holds if $A$ has injective envelopes. A thick subcategory $T\subset A$ is a coreflective iff $(T,F)$ is a [[torsion theory]] where

$$
F := \{X\in Ob A\,|\,A(T,X) = 0\}
$$
