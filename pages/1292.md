A [[full subcategory]] of an [[abelian category|abelian]] or [[triangulated category|triangulated]] category is __thick__ (or __épaisse__) if it is closed under [[extension]]s. For many authors, including [[Pierre Gabriel]], in abelian categories, this term denotes the stronger notion of a [[topologizing subcategory]] closed under extensions; in other words, a nonempty 
full subcategory $T$ of an abelian category $A$ is 
thick (in strong sense) iff with all objects contains all its subquotients and contains extensions, i.e. for every exact sequence 
$$
0 \longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M''\longrightarrow M'\longrightarrow 0
$$
in $A$, the object $M''$ is in $T$ iff $M$ and $M'$ are in $T$.

For some others the thick subcategory, strong version, is called a [[Serre subcategory]] (in a weak sense).

For any subcategory of an abelian category $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which any (nonzero) [[subquotient]] of $N$ in $T$
has a (nonzero) [[subobject]] from $T$. This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ with $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].
Moreover $\bar{T}$ is always thick in the stronger sense.
[[Serre subcategory|Serre subcategories]] in the strong sense are those subcategories which are stable under the operation $T\mapsto\bar{T}$.
