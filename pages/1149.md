The following is (supposed to be) a pedagogical motivation of the 
concepts [[sheaf]], [[stack]], [[infinity-stack]] and
[[Higher Topos Theory|higher topos theory]]. It assumes 
only that the reader has a heuristic knowledge of [[topological space]]s
and aims to provide from that a heuristic but useful idea of 
the relevance of the circle of ideas of [[Categories and Sheaves|categories and sheaves]],
[[nonabelian cohomology]],
[[sheaf cohomology]] and a bit of [[Higher Topos Theory|higher topos theory]].


## Motivation: maps between topological spaces ##

It is a familiar fact that classes of maps between [[topological space]]s encode interesting information.

To pick just one simple but important example: there is a [[topological space]]  that goes by the name
$K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ or $B U(1)$ and is called an [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane space]]. 
Whatever the name of this space, it is that space which has the  peculiar property that for any other space $X$,
the [[homotopy]] classes $[X, B U(1)]$ of continuous maps
from $X$ to this space $B U(1)$ characterize the following useful information:

* they correspond to equivalence classes of circle [[bundle]]s over $X$: that is, to spaces $P$ equipped with a map to $X$ such that over 
a contractible open subset $U \subset X$ the space $P$ looks like
the [[product]] of $U$ with the circle, $P|_U \simeq U \times S^1$ (and such that the identification respects the action of the [[group]] $U(1)$ on the circle). One says that $B U(1)$ is the [[classifying space]] for circle [[bundle]]s:
$
  [X, B U(1)] \simeq \{ circle bundles over X \}/_{\sim}
$

  * one says that $B U(1)$ is the [[classifying space]] for circle bundles or that it [[representable functor|represents]] the assignment of circle bundles to spaces -- to some extent the topic of sheaves, and cohomology is all about the notion of such [[representable functor|representability]]

  * A famous such circle bundle you may have seen is the [Hopf bundle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bundle), which is a way to map the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$ to the familiar 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$, such that over small parts $U \subset S^2$ of the 2-sphere the 3-sphere looks like the [[product]] space $U \times S^1$.

  * This particular circle bundle corresponds to a very special class of maps $X \to B U(1)$: namely the collection of maps $[S^2, B U(1)]$ happens to have the structure of the abelian group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers under addition, and the [Hopf bundle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bundle) corresponds to the the generating element $1$ of this group;
  
  * generally, this abelian group formed by $[X, B U(1)]$ 
  is famous under another name: it is called the second integral [[cohomology]] group of $X$, denoted $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$.
  
* There is a similar such cohomology group $H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ 
of $X$ for every natural number $n$: the $(n+1)$st 
_integral cohomology group_ of $X$ -- and all these groups are naturally
realized in terms of homotopy classes of maps from $X$ into 
some topological space -- called $K(\mathbb{Z}, n+1)$ or $B^{n} U(1)$)  -- and again each element in these groups can be identified with a certain geometric structure living over $X$, called a circle $n$-bundle or $(n-1)$-gerbe: 
$
  [X, \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)] =
  \{
    circle n-bundles on X
  \}/_~
$

* So these cohomology groups encode a lot of interesting information about topological spaces; but there is some useful information about a space, which is not
encoded in maps from it to another topological space: 

* in particular, if the space $X$ in question 
is not just a [[topological space]] but carries extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]], such as being a _smooth manifold_, then one is interested  in _smooth_ circle bundles over $X$ which are equipped with a [[connection]] $\nabla$: a good rule which assigns to each smooth path  $\gamma : x \to y$ in $X$ an identification between the two circles over its endpoints;
$
  \array{
    x && \stackrel{\nabla}{\mapsto} & S^1_x
    \\
    \downarrow^\gamma
    &&&
    \downarrow^{\nabla(\gamma)}
    \\
    y && \stackrel{\nabla}{\mapsto} & S^1_y
  }
$

  * this is the point where these considerations become of interest for [[physics]]: there bundles with connection, and then $n$-bundles/($n-1$)-gerbes with connection encode _gauge fields_ such as the electromagnetic field.

  * you might guess that there is a smooth manifold classifying smooth circle bundles with connection -- but there is not, not unless one stretches the meaning of _manifold_ and of _space_ in general a bit and come up  maybe we just need a slightly more flexible notion of what "space" should mean.
 
* the generalization of the notion of _space_ which does
 accomplish this: the notion of a [[sheaf]]

  * (there is a very general abstract nonsense way to understand [[sheaf|sheaves]] as generalized spaces in the context of a very general abstract [[duality]] between the notions of  [[space and quantity]]. The following is a heuristic way to understand this).


## the basic idea of sheaves ##

 
* To understand what a [[sheaf]] is, recall which aspect of the notion of [[topological space]] was relevant in the above examples $B^{n} U(1)$: these spaces were entirely characterized by how one can _map_ other spaces _into_ them:
$X \mapsto [X,B^n U(1)]$;

* this is a general strategy that one can adopt: suppose I dream up a space but don't tell you which one it is, but I give you hints: for each other space $U$ that you can dream up, I tell you how you can _probe_ my space by mapping your space $U$ into it.
 
  * Let's now call the space which I dreamed up $X$, the generic symbol for spaces. For every space $U$ that you come up with, I do some secret computation and then present you with the result: I hand you a [[set]], let's call it $X(U)$, and tell you  that this is the set of ways that $U$ can be mapped into $X$: $\begin{aligned}X(U) &= \{ways to map U into some hypothetical X\} \\ &=: \{probes of X by U\} \end{aligned} $
 
  * will you be able, in general, to guess my space $X$ from this information $U \mapsto X(U)$? Hardly. So, to be fair, I should provide a bit more of information: what you need to know to actually get a feeling for what my space $X$ is like is an idea about how different ways of probing my space relate to each other;
 
  * Okay, so we'll do this: for every pair $U$ and $V$ of test spaces that you come up with, and for every way $\phi : U \to V$ of mapping these into each other, I inform you not only about the set of ways $X(U) = \{U-probes of X\}$ that $U$ can be mapped into my secret space $X$, and the set of ways $X(V) = \{V-probes of X\}$ that $V$ can be mapped into my secret space, but I also tell you how these are related when you first map $V$ into $X$ by a map $(p : V \to X) \in X(V)$ and then map $U$ into $X$ by first mapping it to $V$: $U \stackrel{f}{\to}  V \stackrel{p}{\to}  X$.
 

  * This transforms every element in $X(V)$ into an element in $X(U)$. To be fair, I should tell you at least what this transformation is!
 
  * So I'll do that: for every map of test space $f : U \to V$ that you hand me, I return you a map of sets that I denote $X(\phi) : X(V) \to X(U)$, which indicates how $V$-proves of $X$ turn into $U$-probes when you precompose them with $\phi : U \to V$.
  
* Do you need still more information to guess my space $X$? It turns out that: no, this information is enough!

  * This somewhat remarkable fact is closely related to a fundamental statement of [[category theory]]: the [[Yoneda lemma]] and its implication on [[representable functor]]s.
These terms will be discussed in a moment:

* Namely, there is a bit more to the game than mentioned so far: you need to be sure that even if I  won't reveal my space $X$ to you directly, the little information about it which I do provide, that rule $U \mapsto X(U)$,  I should provide honestly and consistently. Some consistency checks to assure that I am not just making things up
but am giving you consistent information about my secret space $X$ are the following:
 
   * it must be true that when you hand me the identity map $Id_U : U \to U$ on a test space, that then then I return you the identity map $Id_{X(U)} : X(U) \to X(U)$ on the set of probes of $X$ by $U$;
   
   * also, it must be true that when you first hand me two consecutive maps of test spaces, $f : U \to V$ and $g : V \to W$, and then hand me their composite $g \circ f : U \to W$, that my reply $X(g \circ f) : X(W) \to X(U)$ to the latter is the result of composing my two replies about the former: $X(g \circ f) = X(W) \stackrel{X(g)}{\to} X(V) \stackrel{X(f)}{\to} X(U)$.
   
* such an assignment $U \mapsto X(U)$ of sets to spaces which satisfies the above two properties is what is called a [[presheaf]]: this, in turn, is nothing but what is called a [[functor]] on a [[category]]:

  * the [[category]] in question here is the collection of test [[topological space]]s $\{U\}$, called [[object]]s, equipped with continuous maps between them $\{f : U \to V\}$, called [[morphism]]s, which may be composed when their domains and targets match. This composition is associative in the obvious way and on every object $U$ there is an [[identity]] map $Id_U : U \to U$,  composition with which does nothing. This category is known by the name [[Top]]; $
  Top = \{topological spaces and continuous maps between them\}
$

  * the other [[category]] in the game, namely the [[category]] called [[Set]] whose [[object]]s are [[set]]s and whose [[morphism]]s are functions between sets: $ Set = \{sets and functions between them\}$

  * the probe-game which we are playing can hence be understood as being an assignment of [[object]]s in [[Set]] to [[object]]s in [[Top]] and of [[morphism]]s in [[Set]] to [[morphism]]s in [[Top]] which satisfies the above consistency conditions: this is called a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[Set]]-valued [[functor]] or a [[presheaf]] on [[Top]] and it is denoted $X(-) : Top^{op} \to Set$

* We say [[presheaf]] instead of just [[functor]], even though taken at face value a presheaf is just a functor, to indicate that there is one further, more nontrivial consistency check on the information about probes of my secret space $X$ which you should do: it must be true that you can piece together the information which I give for small test spaces to deduce information about probes by bigger test spaces.

  * More precisely, if I tell you the set $X(U)$ of probes of my secret space $X$ by the test space $U$, and if you then chop up $U$ into two pieces $V_1$ and $V_2$  sitting inside $U$ by inclusion maps $p_i : V_i \hookrightarrow U$, with a bit of overlap $V_1 \cap V_2$, then it ought to be true that all the probes by $U$ in $X(U)$ can be entirely and exactly be reconstructed from taking probes by $V_1$ in $X(V_1)$ and by $V_2$ in $X(V_2)$ and see if they match over the overlap $V_1 \cap V_2$ of the two small probes: 
   
  * in symbols, the collection of pairs in $\{matching maps from V_1 and V_2 to X\} \hookrightarrow X(V_1) \times X(V_2)$ whose elements coincide when restricted to the overlap $X(V_1) \times X(V_2) \stackrel{\stackrel{restrict first element}{\to}}{\stackrel{restrict second element}{\to}} X(V_1 \cap V_2)$ should be exactly all the possible maps in $X(U)$: $\{matching probes of X on V_1 and V_2 \} \simeq X(U)$

  * one says that the set $\{matching probes of X on V_1 and V_2 \}$ is the [[equalizer]] of the two [[parallel morphisms]] $X(V_1) \times X(V_2) \stackrel{\stackrel{restrict first element}{\to}}{\stackrel{restrict second element}{\to}} X(V_1 \cap V_2)$: the optimal solution to mapping into $X(V_1) \times X(V_2)$ such that these two maps become equal;

  * this condition is called a [[sheaf]] or [[descent and codescent|descent]] condition: one thinks of the sheaf of _descending_ from the cover to the base along the map $(V_1 \sqcup V_2) \stackrel{p_1 \sqcup p_2}{\to} U$;
   
* This now is a sensible game to play: I don't tell you directly which space $X$ I am thinking of, but I do give you all the information $U \mapsto X(U)$ about its probes $X(U)$  by test spaces $U$, subject to the condition that

  * $X(-)$ is functorial and hence a [[presheaf]];

  * $X(-)$ satisfies [[descent and codescent|descent]] and is therefore a [[sheaf]]

## sheaves more general than spaces ##

So far we have been talking about using topological spaces as probe spaces, hence about presheaves on the category [[Top]]. One can use other systems $S$ of test spaces  
as long as $S$ forms a [[category]] and such that there is an agreement about how some of its [[object]]s $U$, can be [[cover]]ed by other [[object]]s, such as the $V_1$ and $V_2$ above. Such an agreement of what counts as a [[cover]] in a [[category]] is called a [[coverage]] or a [[Grothendieck topology|topology]], and a [[category]] equipped with such an information is called a [[site]];

Here are some important examples:

* A popular choice is to fix one particular topological space $Z$ and probe all generalized spaces using only open subsets $U \subset Z$ of $Z$. These open subsets form the [[category of open subsets]] $S = Op(Z)$ and the choice of [[coverage]] is the obvious one. [[sheaf|Sheaves]] on $Op(Z)$ are generalized spaces _over_ $Z$. 

* Another relevant choice is to use instead of all topological test spaces in the category [[Top]] all smooth manifolds as test spaces, in the category $S =$ [[Diff]]. 

* Or the combination of these: the test spaces in the category $Op(Z)$ for $Z$ a smooth manifold.


We had motivated this language of sheaves as a reformulation of the familar notion of spaces in a somewhat more indirect form: a rule for how to probe a space. But now something nice happens: it turns out that there are collections of probe information $X(-) : S^{op} \to Set$ which do obey the rules, i.e. do form a sheaf, but for which there is nevertheless _no_ test space in $S$ that it describes probes into. And in fact, this is the generic case.

* On the other hand, maybe this just means that our notion of "ordinary space" was a bit too restrictive: after all, we noticed that all that really matters usually are the 
ways we can probe a given space by other spaces; and
that the information about such probes is useful if only
it obeys the rules of being a sheaf.

* So we have every justification then to regard sheaves in general as perfectly valid _generalized spaces_; or more precisely: we regard sheaves as rules for how to  probe generalized spaces, and we take these generalized spaces to be entirely specified by their [[sheaf|sheaves]] of probes.


Examples:


* The notion of "generalized" here depends on the perspective of our probes. For the probe category of the form $S = Op(Z)$ with $Z$ a topological space, most sheaves are "generalized spaces" in that they do not describe maps into a space in $S$, i.e. an open subset of $Z$. But every sheaf on $Op(Z)$ can be shown to correspond to maps from $X$ to an ordinary topological space $E$ which is equipped with a continuous map $p : E \to X$ down to $X$, such that $p$ is locally a homeomorphism. Such $E$ are called _&eacute;tale spaces_ over $X$.

* A sheaf on $S = $ [[Diff]] is a [[generalized smooth space]]. These may be very different from ordinary manifolds and ordinary topological spaces. There are generalized smooth spaces with a single point and still many curves in them. In fact, the generalized classifying space for smooth circle bundles with connection that we are still after is of this form.




# maps between generalized spaces#

* Since we are thinking of sheaves $F_X : S^{op} \to Set$ and $F_Y : S^{op} \to Set$ as characterizing 'generalized spaces' $X$ and $Y$, we better have a good notion of maps between sheaves $F_X \to F_Y$ that corresponds to a sensible notion of maps $X \to Y$ between generalized spaces.  

* That's easy to figure out: if $f : X \to Y$ is supposed to be a map between generalized spaces, whatever these are, then in particular it turns every probe $p \in X(U)$, of $X$ which we are thinking of as a probe map $p : U \to X$, to a probe $f \circ p \in Y(U)$ of $Y$, which we should think of as the composite map $f \circ p : U \stackrel{p}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y$ that simply maps the image of $U$ in $X$ further to an image of $U$ in $Y$ using the map $f : X \to Y$.

  * nota bene: for the time being there is no space $X$ such that thinking of probes $p \in X(U)$ as maps $p : U \to X$ of some sort would literally make sense. However, once we impose some consistency conditions on the probe sets $X(U)$ precisely this will make sense. And to motivate these consistency conditions in the first place, it is best to already think of probes $p \in X(U)$ as being maps $p : U \to X$.

  * so in terms of their collections (sheaves) of probes a map $f : X \to Y$ of generalized spaces should be given for each probe space $U$ by a map of sets of probes $f_U : X(U) \to Y(U)$, to be thought of as encoding the post-composition map $f_U : (U \stackrel{p}{\to} X) \mapsto (U \stackrel{p}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y)$

  * but we can also pre-compose: given a map $\phi : U \to V$ of test spaces, we also have the probe transformation map from above, $X(\phi) : X(V) \to X(U)$ which is to be thought of as acting by $X(\phi) : (V \stackrel{p}{\to} X) \mapsto (U \stackrel{\phi}{\to} V \stackrel{p}{\to} X)$

  * and we can combine both pre- and postcomposition and send $(V \stackrel{p}{\to} X) \mapsto (U \stackrel{\phi}{\to} V \stackrel{p}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y)$

  * in this notation it is manifestly clear that it must not matter whether we first pre- and then post-compose, or the other way around. But recall that so far writing $p : V \to X$ for a probe $p \in X(V)$ is just notation. So we need to enforce the obvious here on our formalism explicitly, lest the interpretation of generalized spaces breaks down.

  * name this means that the map 
$X(V) \stackrel{f_V}{\to} Y(V) \stackrel{\phi^*}{\to} Y(U)$
which first turns a $V$-probe of $X$ into a $V$-probe of $Y$ and then turns the result into a $U$-probe of $Y$, must coincide with the map
$X(V) \stackrel{\phi^*}{\to} X(U) \stackrel{f_U}{\to} Y(U)$
which first turns a $V$-probe of $X$ into a $U$-probe of $X$ and then turns the result into a $U$-probe of $Y$.

Such an equality between two different composite maps is conveniently depicted as a square

$$
  \array{
     X(U)
     &\stackrel{f_U}{\to}&
     Y(U)
     \\
     \uparrow^{X(\phi)}
     &&
     \uparrow^{Y(\phi)}
     \\
     X(V)
     &\stackrel{f_V}{\to}&
     Y(V)
  }
$$

The fact that the two ways of going from the bottom left to the top right of the square are supposed to be equal is called. "the square commutes", or "the square is commutative".


* So that then is our definition of maps $f : X \to Y$ between generalized spaces $X$ and $Y$: if $U \mapsto X(U)$ and $V \mapsto X(V)$ are the probe-assignments that define $X$ and $Y$, then the map $f$ is defined by probe-transformations $f_U : X(U) \to Y(U)$ such that for all maps $\phi : U \to V$ the above squares commute.

  * Such a collection of data is called a [[natural transformation]] between the probe-assigning [[functor]]s $X(-)$ and $Y(-)$. Clearly, its a transformation, and it being "natural" just means that it satisfies the obvious consistency condition we discussed. 


* With this understanding of maps between generalized spaces in hand, we should go back and compare it to the notion of _probes_ of generalized spaces by ordinary spaces.

  * we had started the discussion with observing that every ordinary topological space $X$ defines a [[sheaf]] of probes by the assignment $U \mapsto X(U) := \{maps from U to X\}$ =: Maps(U,X).

  * this way every ordinary space is a generalized space, of course;

  * but that should make us nervous: because it means that now there are two _different_ definitions of what a map from a test topological space $U$ to a topological space should be: 

    * on the one hand, it should be an element in $X(U) = MapsOfTopologicalSpaces(U,X)$;

    * on the other hand, we can regard both $U$ and $X$ as generalized spaces and then look at the maps of generalized spaces between them, as just discussed above;

    * if  these two notions of maps don't coincide, then the whole picture of generalized spaces so far runs into inconsistencies!

    * luckily it doesn't, as one can check. Both notions of maps, while defined differently, happen to be perfectly equivalent. This statement is a simple exercise to prove, and still is the fundamental fact which makes the important idea of generalized spaces works -- this fact is called the [[Yoneda lemma]]: it says that
$
  \begin{aligned}
    MapsOfOrdinarySpaces(U,X) &=: X(U)
    \\ & = MapsOfGeneralizedSpaces(U,X)
  \end{aligned}
$
or more formally
$
  Hom_{Sheaves}(U,X) \simeq X(U)
$.

  * as a slogan: **The Yoneda lemma says that the idea of generalized spaces determined by their collections of probes is consistent.**

* This point is so important that it is worthwhile to build it into our very notation, so that we can't but think of the situation in this way.

   * We agree for any two generalized spaces $X$ and $Y$ to write $X(Y)$ for the collection of maps from $Y$ to $X$: $ X(Y) := MapsOfGeneralizedSpaces(Y,X)$

   * If $Y = U$ happens to be an ordinary space, then $X(U)$ consistently and equivalently denotes both: the collection of probes of $X$ by the ordinary space $U$, and the collection of maps of $U$ into $X$, with $U$ regarded as a generalized space itself.

    * (This notation is for instance used in the book [[Categories and Sheaves]], see page 25.)


## and more: a topos of generalized spaces ##


*  It turns out that we can keep going this way. There is not just a natural notion of maps between generalized spaces given by  [[sheaf|sheaves]], but every important type of operation on spaces has its analogs as an operation on sheaves: one says that  sheaves form a [[topos]]: a place where we can go 
to study generalized [[homotopy theory]], 
more general than the place of [[topological space]]s, but where still all the crucial constructions familiar from topological spaces makes sense;

## higher sheaves: $\infty$-stacks ##

* Once we are at this point, we should go even a bit further: we have been talking about _sets_ of probes $X(U)$. But of course 
for $X$ a true [[topological space]] and $U$ a [[topological space]], there
is not just a set, but a [[topological space]] of maps $U \to X$ (using the [compact-open topology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact-open_topology) on spaces of continuous maps).  So we should be looking at sheaves with values in topological spaces: functors $X(-) : S^{op} \to Top$ satisfying some suitable condition.

* There is only one thing we need to take care of, then: since a 
topological spaces is a bit more flexible than a plain set, 
we should be a bit careful about when two sheaves $U \mapsto X(U)$
with values in topological spaces are to be regarded as
equal for all practical purposes: recall that $X(U)$ is
to be thought of as the space of all ways of mapping a probe
space $U$ into a space $X$. It's not the single points (maps) in this
space which matter so much, but they way they hang together. 

  * All "ways of hanging together" in a topological space $X(U)$
  are measured by a collection of groups called the 
  [[homotopy group]]s $\pi_n(X(U))$, one for each natural number $n$.
  
  * So if we are being careful, we should recognize that two sheaves  $X : S^{op} \to Top$ and $Y : S^{op} \to Top$ must characterize essentially the same generalized space if there is a rule $f : X \to Y$ for turning for each test space $U$, probes of $X$ into probes of $Y$, $f_U : X(U) \to Y(U)$, as before, such that for _sufficiently small_ $U$ this comparison map of
  probe spaces does not change the homotopy groups, i.e. so that
  all induced homomorphism $\pi_n(f_U, x) : \pi_n(X(U)) \to \pi_n(X(V), f_U(x))$ of [[homotopy group]]s are isomorphisms of groups. One says that such $f_U$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].
  
  * If a comparison map $f : X \to Y$ exists with these properties (for small enough $U$, recall), then one says that our generalized spaces $X$ and $Y$ defined by these sheaves are _weakly equivalent_ or [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]].
  
* There are several ways to deal with this complication that 
sheaves with values in topological spaces are very flexible, so flexible
that it may require a bit of effort to determine if two of them 
determine the same generalized space, for all practical purposes. 

* One nice way to deal with it is to again go back to our attitude that everything  should be determined by how we map other things into it: if $f : X \to Y$ is a weak equivalence of sheaves, as above, then we
we would expect that for $Z$ any other sheaf, the induced map of spaces of probes $Z(f) : Z(Y) \to Z(X)$
of $Z$ by $X$ and $Y$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 


  * Recall from the discussion in the above section "maps of generalized spaces" that $Z(Y)$ is just another way saying "space of maps of generalized spaces from $Y$ to $Z$", and similarly for $Z(X)$. 



* Now, that may fail to be true, simply because we are using
an awkward realization of the sheaf $Z$. It may be that we have to _straighten out_ $Z$ a bit, without really changing it, for the above to be true. Indeed, if things are set up correctly, there should always a sheaf of topological spaces $Z'$ which is equivalent to $Z$, but for which the above consistency condition is true: the map $Z'(f) : Z'(Y) \to Z'(X)$ between spaces of probes of $Z'$ by $X$ and by $Y$ is a homotopy equivalence.

* The sheaves with this niceness property are called [[infinity-stack]]s or [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]]. Recall that despite the fancy terminology, these things are nothing but consistent rules for something that may be probed with test spaces $U$, $V$,...

  * in applications this means that before we compute the space of maps $[X,A]$ between generalized spaces, we first have two ensure that at least one of them is sufficiently _straightened out_. Once says one picks a _resolution_. More on that below.


## generalized cohomology ##

* We come back to our original motivation. Recall that we were looking
at cohomology groups of spaces $X$ by mapping $X$ into other spaces.
We noticed that there is in general interesting information about
$X$ which cannot be gained by mapping it into an ordinary topological
space. Starting from this we have now arrived at a more general notion 
of space, called a higher sheaf or an $\infty$-stack.

* So let's state for the record that we succeeded: we will say now for 
$X$ and $A$ generalized spaces, $\infty$-stacks, that the 
collection of maps
$$
  H(X,A) := [X,A]
$$
from $X$ to $A$ is the [[cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $A$.

* Indeed, one finds that despite their enlarged generality, these $\infty$-stacks
behave in all relevant aspects just like ordinary sheaves and ordinary
topological spaces do. So one says that $\infty$-stacks form an [[infinity-topos]]
(more precisely: an [[(infinity,1)-topos]]): a place where we can go in order
to do the familiar [[homotopy theory]} of topological spaces in a more
general context.


  
##  complexes of sheaves: abelian $\infty$-stacks  ##

* Another term for this [[cohomology|generalized cohomology]] theory thus obtained is
[[nonabelian cohomology]]. The reason for that terms is a historic one: before arriving at the full picture of higher topos theory as described here, people had a pretty good guess about some aspects of this story, and this aspect they called 
[[abelian sheaf cohomology|sheaf cohomology]]. It turns out that sheaf cohomology is precisely the _abelian_ part of general cohomology. So now general cohomology is sometimes called [[nonabelian cohomology]] to distinguish it from the more traditional cohomology theory. 

* Here is what "abelian part of general cohomology" means:

  * For many sheaves that appear in practice, the topological space $X(U)$ assigned to any test space $U$ is not just a topological space, but happens to have the structure of an abelian group, too. 
  
  * In this case a cascade of simplifications kicks is: first of all,
  such topological spaces, by a special case of something called the 
  [[homotopy hypothesis]] (which is really a precise theorem) 
  can be identified with simplicial abelian groups. 
  
  * Second, by another theorem called the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]],
  simplicial abelian groups are equivalently encoded more simply
  in the collection of data given by
  (non-positively graded) chain complexes in abelian groups.

* By an [[abelian sheaf]] one means a sheaf $U \mapsto X(U)$ which
takes values in [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups
(or,  more generally, in [[complex]]es in another [[abelian category]]).
Under the above correspondences, we understand this as a special case
of a sheaf with values in topological spaces. 

* By [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] one means nothing but the above
general [[Higher Topos Theory|higher topos theoretic]] notion of
cohomology given by the simple idea of collections of maps from 
one generalized space to another. Only that in the special
case of abelian sheaves a wealth of particular computational
techniques are used to compute these mapping spaces
(such as [[derived category|derived categories]] and 
[[derived functor|derived functors]]) which are not available in the
fully general case. This wealth of computational machinery
employed, useful as it is, sometimes hides the simple conceptual
reasoning underlying everything.
  
* there is a collection of tools available for _computing_ explicitly the cohomologies  $H(X,A) := [X,A]$ for the case that the coefficient space can be thought of as a complex of abelian groups, or a complex of modules, these tools go by names like

  * [[model category]]

    * [[derived category]]

    * [[multiplicative system]] / [[factorization system]]

    * [[localization]]

  * [[derived functor]]

    * [[injective object|injective resoltution]]

    * [[bar and cobar construction]]

* and so forth; historically many concepts in abelian sheaf theory were thought to be _defined_ in terms of these constructions. From a more modern perspective all these are just tools for unraveling an independent reality. This also explains why there are so many different tools which yield the same results. Most notably in the context of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] there are two general ways for computing this cohomology called

  * right derived global section functor

  * Cech cohomology;

* these two methods differ in whether one computes using "resolutions" of either the coefficient object $A$ (this happens in the right derived global section functor approach) or in the domain object $X$ (this happens in Cech cohomology).


## Examples ##

* Recall that we started the search for a generalized notion of space
motivated by the fact that a circle bundle on a space $X$ may be
encoded by a map from $X$ to some topological space $B U(1)$, but
that the same was not true for circle bundles _with connection_.
We had wanted to obtain a generalized notion of space such that 
this is remedied.

  * Indeed, this is now the case. There is a famous 
  abelian sheaf, called the second [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne complex]] which we may denote by
  $[P_1(-), \mathbf{B}U(1)]$ or $\bar \mathbf{B}_1 U(1)$ (as explained at [[Deligne cohomology]]), which has precisely the property that maps from a manifold $X$ into it classify circle bundles with connection on $X$. Moreover, by varying the two parameters here we get the following cases
  

    * $A = [P_0(-), \mathbf{B}U(1)] = \mathbf{B}U(1)$;  $H(X,A) = H^2(X,A)$ is second integral cohomology -- classifies line bundles;

    * $A = [P_1(-), \mathbf{B}U(1)] = \bar \mathbf{B}_1 U(1)$; $H(X,A) = \bar H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is second differential integral cohomology -- classifies line bundles with connection;

    * $A = [P_2(-), \mathbf{B}U(1)] = \bar \mathbf{B}_2 U(1)$; $ H(X,A) = \bar H_{flat}^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is second flat differential integral cohomology -- classifies smooth line bundles with flat connection;
  
    * $A = [P_0(-), \mathbf{B}^2U(1)] = \mathbf{B}^2U(1)$;  $H(X,A) = H^3(X,A)$ is third integral cohomology -- classifies line bundle gerbes;

    * $A = [P_1(-), \mathbf{B}^2U(1)] = \bar \mathbf{B}^2_1 U(1)$ -- classifies line bundle gerbes with connective structure;

    * $A = [P_2(-), \mathbf{B}^2U(1)] = \bar \mathbf{B}^2_2 U(1)$; $ H(X,A) = \bar H_{flat}^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is third differential integral cohomology -- classifies smooth line bundle gerbes with connection;
  
    * $A = [P_3(-), \mathbf{B}^2U(1)] = \bar \mathbf{B}^2_3 U(1)$; $ H(X,A) = \bar H_{flat}^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is third flat differential integral cohomology -- classifies line bundle gerbes with flat connection;


* Notice that all these objects $A$ do indeed behave, and can be treated like, generalized spaces. For instance one can look at paths in these spaces and for instance form their [[fundamental groupoid]]s. One finds results such that for instance 

   * $\Pi_1(\bar \mathbf{B}_2 U(1)) \simeq \mathbf{B}R$

   * more generally: for $G$ any Lie group, we have
     $\Pi_1(\bar \mathbf{B}_2 G) \simeq \mathbf{B}\hat G$, where $\hat G$ is the unique simply connected Lie group covering $G$.
