## Idea

In the presence of a notion of [[fibration]] and a given class of such, a morphism is called _anodyne_ if it has the [[left lifting property]] against all these.

The standard example, often taken to be the default, is that of morphisms in the category [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]] which have the left lifting property against all [[Kan fibrations]]. In this case, anodyne morphisms are equivalent to [[acyclic cofibrations]] in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

Typically one says _anodyne morphism_ or, actually, _anodyne extension_ if one thinks of these morphisms produced by [[retracts]] of [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] of [[coproducts]] of a certain generating set of morphisms.

So in the standard example of left lifting against Kan fibrations, one typically speaks of _anodyne extension_ if one produces morphisms by these operations from the set of [[horn]] inclusions. (see for instance ([Jardine](#Jardine))).


## Definition

### Relative to Kan fibrations of simplicial sets

A [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ of [[simplicial sets]] is called **anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[Kan fibration]]s.

So $f$ is anodyne if for every [[Kan fibration]] $X \to Y$ and every commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^f && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\to& Y
  }
$$

there exists a lift

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^f &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    B &\to& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

See for instance ([Jardine](#Jardine)) for details.

### Relative to left/right inner Kan fibrations of simplicial sets

Similarly a morphism is called

* **left anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[left Kan fibration]]s

* **right anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[right Kan fibration]]s

* **inner anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[inner Kan fibration]]s

See ([Lurie](#Lurie)) (following Joyal).

### Relative to inner Kan fibrations of dendroidal sets

In the category of [[dendroidal sets]] there is a notion of horn inclusions that generazies that of simplicial sets. The corresponding saturated class of morphisms is called that of dendroidal **inner anodyne morphisms**.

See ([Cisinski-Moerdijk 09](#CisinskiMoerdijk09)).
