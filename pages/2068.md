## Idea

The original definition by Gabriel–Zisman (Definition IV.2.1.4 \cite{GabrielZisman67})
defined __anodyne extensions__ as the [[weak saturation]] of [[simplicial horn]] inclusions.

More generally, the same definition can be used to talk about the [[weak saturation]] of any set $S$ of morphisms
in any category.  One also talks about _anodyne maps_ or _anodyne morphisms_.

If the [[small object argument]] is applicable,
anodyne maps are precisely maps with a [[left lifting property]] with respect to all [[fibrations]], where the latter is defined as morphisms with a [[right lifting property]] with respect to $S$.

In particular, if $S$ is a set of generating [[acyclic cofibrations]] in a [[model category]] with applicable [[small object argument]], then anodyne maps are precisely [[acyclic cofibrations]].

The standard example, often taken to be the default, is that of morphisms in the category [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]] which have the [[left lifting property]] against all [[Kan fibrations]]. In this case, anodyne morphisms ([Gabriel-Zisman 67, chapter IV.2](#GabrielZisman67)) are equivalent to [[acyclic cofibrations]] in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].

So in the standard example of left lifting against Kan fibrations, one typically speaks of _anodyne extensions_ if one produces morphisms by these operations from the set of [[horn]] inclusions. (see for instance ([Jardine](#Jardine))).

## Definition

### Relative to Kan fibrations of simplicial sets

A [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ of [[simplicial sets]] is called **anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[Kan fibrations]].

So $f$ is anodyne if for every [[Kan fibration]] $X \to Y$ and every commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^f && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\to& Y
  }
$$

there exists a lift

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^f &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    B &\to& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

See for instance ([Jardine](#Jardine)) for details.

### Relative to left/right inner Kan fibrations of simplicial sets

Similarly a morphism is called

* **left anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[left Kan fibration]]s

* **right anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[right Kan fibration]]s

* **inner anodyne** if it has the left [[lifting property]] with respect to all [[inner Kan fibration]]s

See ([Lurie](#Lurie)) (following Joyal).

### Relative to inner Kan fibrations of dendroidal sets

In the category of [[dendroidal sets]] there is a notion of horn inclusions that generazies that of simplicial sets. The corresponding saturated class of morphisms is called that of dendroidal **inner anodyne morphisms**.

See ([Cisinski-Moerdijk 09](#CisinskiMoerdijk09)).

## Properties

### Pushout-products with inclusions

+-- {: .num_prop #PushoutProductOfSimplicialCofibrationWithAcyclicCOfibIsAcyclic}
###### Proposition

The [[pushout product]] $f \Box g$ of two [[monomorphisms]] $f,g$ in [[sSet]] is again a monomorphism, which is anodyne (a weak homotopy equivalence) if $f$ or $g$ is so.

=--

This is due to ([Gabriel-Zisman 67, IV.2, prop. 2.2](#GabrielZisman67)). The argument is somewhat more streamlined form is also in [Joyal-Tierney 05, theorem 3.2.2](#JoyalTierney05)

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{PushoutProductOfSimplicialCofibrationWithAcyclicCOfibIsAcyclic} is the key lemma which implies (is effectively equivalent to) the statement that the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] is an [[enirched model category]] over itself.
