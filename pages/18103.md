## Definition

In a [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ a point $x \in X$ is called a _closed point_ if the [[singleton set]] $\{x\} \subset X$ is a [[closed subset]] of $X$.

## Related concepts

* [[irreducible closed subset]]

* [[open point]]

* [[interior point]]

## Properties

* A [[topological space]] is a [[T1-topological space|T1-space]] precisely if all its points are closed points.
