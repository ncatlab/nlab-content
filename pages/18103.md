## Definition

In a [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ a point $x \in X$ is called a _closed point_ if the [[singleton set]] $\{x\} \subset X$ is a [[closed subset]] of $X$.

## Related concepts

* [[irreducible closed subset]]

* [[open point]]

* [[interior point]]


## Examples
 {#Examples}

* A [[topological space]] is a [[T1-topological space|T1-space]] precisely if all its points are closed points.

* In the [[Zariski topology]] on an [[algebraic variety]] $Spec(R)$, the closed points correspond to the _[[maximal ideals]]_ in $R$ ([this Prop.](Zariski+topology#MaximalIdealsAreClosedPoints)).

* In particular the [[prime numbers]] correspond to the closed points in [[Spec(Z)]] ([this Example](Zariski+topology#SpecZ)).
