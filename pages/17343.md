## **Prelude) Classical homotopy theory**
 {#ClassicalHomotopyTheory}

We are interested in the [[stable homotopy category]] of [[spectra]], to which we turn [below](#Spectra). But since its existence is an adjunct of the [[classical homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] of [[homotopy types]] of [[topological spaces]]/[[simplicial sets]], we here review that first.

### **P.1)** Topological homotopy theory
 {#TopologicalHomotopyTheory}


While the field of [[algebraic topology]] clearly originates in [[topology]], it is not actually interested in [[topological spaces]] regarded up to topological [[isomorphism]], namely [[homeomorphism]] ("point-set topology"), but only in topological spaces regarded up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]] -- hence it is interested only in the "weak [[homotopy types]]" of topological spaces. This is so notably because [[ordinary cohomology]] [[cohomology group|groups]] are [[invariants]] of the (weak) [[homotopy type]] of topological spaces but do not detect their [[homeomorphism]] class. 

The [[category]] of topological spaces obtained by [[localization of a category|forcing]] [[weak homotopy equivalences]] to become [[isomorphisms]] is the "[[classical homotopy category]]" [[Ho(Top)]]. This homotopy category however has forgotten a little too much information: homotopy theory really wants the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] not to become plain [[isomorphisms]], but to become actual [[homotopy equivalences]]. The structure that reflects this is called a _[[model category]]_ structure (short for "category of models for [[homotopy types]]"). For classical homotopy theory this is accordingly called the _[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]_. This we review here.


#### Point-set topology
 {#BackgroundOnTopologicalHomotopyTheoryFromAlgebraicTopology}

This section recalls relevant concepts from actual [[topology]] ("point-set topology") and highlights facts that motivate the axiomatics of [[model categories]] [below](#ModelCategoryTheory). We prove two technical lemmas (lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} and lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}) that serve to establish the abstract homotopy theory of topological spaces [further below](#TheClassicalModelStructureOfTopologicalSpaces). 

**Literature** ([Hirschhorn 15](#Hirschhorn15))

$\,$

Throughout, let _[[Top]]_ denote the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] between them. Its [[isomorphisms]] are the [[homeomorphisms]]. 

(Further [below](#SimplicialSets) in the discussion of [[geometric realization]] we restrict attention to the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]].)


##### Universal constructions

To begin with, we recall some basics on [[universal constructions]] in [[Top]]: [[limits]] and [[colimits]] of [[diagrams]] of [[topological spaces]]; [[exponential objects]].

Generally, recall:

+-- {: .num_defn #LimitsAndColimits}
###### Definition

A **[[diagram]]** in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[small category]] $I$ and a [[functor]]

$$
  X_\bullet
  \;\colon\;
  I \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

$$
  (i \overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow} j)
  \;
  \mapsto
  ( X_i \overset{X(\phi)}{\longrightarrow} X_j)
  \,.
$$

A **[[cone]]** over this diagram is an object $Q$ equipped with morphisms $p_i \colon Q \longrightarrow X_i$ for all $i \in I$, such that all these triangles commute:

$$
  \array{
     && Q
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
     \\
     X_i && \underset{X(\phi)}{\longrightarrow} && X_j
  }
  \,.
$$

Dually, a **[[co-cone]]** under the diagram is $Q$ equipped with morphisms $q_i \colon X_i \longrightarrow Q$ such that all these triangles commute

$$
  \array{
    X_i && \overset{X(\phi)}{\longrightarrow} && X_j
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{q_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{q_j}}
    \\
    && Q
  }
  \,.
$$

A **[[limit]]** over the diagram is a universal cone, denoted $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i$, that is: a cone such that every other cone uniquely factors through it $Q \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i$, making all the resulting triangles commute.

Dually, a **[[colimit]]** over the diagram is a universal co-cone, denoted $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i$.

=--


We now discuss limits and colimits in $\mathcal{C}= $ [[Top]]. The key for understanding these is the fact that there are initial and final topologies:

+-- {: .num_defn #InitialAndFinalTopologies}
###### Definition

Let $\{X_i = (S_i,\tau_i) \in Top\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[set]] of [[topological spaces]], and let $S \in Set$ be a bare [[set]]. Then

* For $\{S \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S_i \}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] out of $S$, the _[[initial topology]]_ $\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[minimum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon (S,\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))\to X_i$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

* For $\{S_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S\}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] into $S$, the _[[final topology]]_ $\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[maximum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon X_i \to (S,\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalSubspace}
###### Example

For $X$ a single topological space, and $\iota_S \colon S \hookrightarrow U(X)$ a subset of its underlying set, then the initial topology $\tau_{intial}(\iota_S)$, def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, is the [[subspace topology]], making

$$
  \iota_S
  \;\colon\;
  (S, \tau_{initial}(\iota_S))
  \hookrightarrow
  X
$$

a [[topological subspace]] inclusion.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #QuotientTopology}
###### Example

Conversely, for $p_S \colon U(X) \longrightarrow S$ an [[epimorphism]], then the final topology $\tau_{final}(p_S)$ on $S$ is the _[[quotient topology]]_.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop}
###### Poposition

Let $I$ be a [[small category]] and let $X_\bullet \colon I \longrightarrow Top$ be an $I$-[[diagram]] in [[Top]] (a [[functor]] from $I$ to $Top$), with components denoted $X_i = (S_i, \tau_i)$, where $S_i \in Set$ and $\tau_i$ a topology on $S_i$. Then:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

   $$
     \array{
       && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
       \\
       S_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && S_j
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies} for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

   $$
     \array{
       S_i && \longrightarrow && S_j
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_j}}
       \\
       && \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{final}(\{\iota_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

=--

(e.g. [Bourbaki 71, section I.4](#Bourbaki71))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The required [[universal property]] of $\left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)$ (def. \ref{LimitsAndColimits}) is immediate: for 

$$
  \array{
    && (S,\tau)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_j}} 
    \\
    X_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && X_j
  }
$$

any [[cone]] over the diagram, then by construction there is a unique function of underlying sets $S \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i$ making the required diagrams commute, and so all that is required is that this unique function is always [[continuous function|continuous]]. But this is precisely what the [[initial topology]] ensures.

The case of the colimit is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

+-- {: .num_example #PointTopologicalSpaceAsEmptyLimit}
###### Example

The limit over the empty diagram in $Top$ is the [[point]] $\ast$ with its unique topology.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpacesIsCoproduct}
###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[coproduct]] $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i \in Top$ is their _[[disjoint union]]_.

=--


In particular:

+-- {: .num_example #DiscreteTopologicalSpaceAsCoproduct}
###### Example

For $S \in Set$, the $S$-indexed [[coproduct]] of the point, $\underset{s \in S}{\coprod}\ast $  is the set $S$ itself equipped with the [[final topology]], hence is the [[discrete topological space]] on $S$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ProductTopologicalSpace}
###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[product]] $\underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i \in Top$ is the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets equipped with the _[[product topology]]_, also called the _[[Tychonoff product]]_.

In the case that $S$ is a [[finite set]], such as for binary product spaces $X \times Y$, then a [[basis for a topology|sub-basis]] for the product topology is given by the [[Cartesian products]] of the open subsets of (a basis for) each factor space.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #EqualizerInTop}
###### Example

The [[equalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the equalizer of the underlying functions of sets 

$$
  eq(f,g) 
   \hookrightarrow 
  S_X 
    \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}} 
  S_Y
$$

(hence the largets subset of $S_X$ on which both functions coincide) and equipped with the [[subspace topology]], example \ref{TopologicalSubspace}.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #CoequalizerInTop}
###### Example

The [[coequalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the coequalizer of the underlying functions of sets 

$$
  S_X 
    \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}} 
  S_Y
    \longrightarrow 
  coeq(f,g)
$$

(hence the [[quotient set]] by the [[equivalence relation]] generated by $f(x) \sim g(x)$ for all $x \in X$)  and equipped with the [[quotient topology]], example \ref{QuotientTopology}.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #PushoutInTop}
###### Example

For 

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
$$

two [[continuous functions]] out of the same [[domain]], then the [[colimit]] under this diagram is also called the _[[pushout]]_, denoted

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g_\ast f}}
     \\
     X &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup_A Y
     \,.
  }
  \,.
$$

(Here $g_\ast f$ is also called the pushout of $f$, or the _[[base change|cobase change]]_ of $f$ along $g$.) 

This is equivalently the [[coequalizer]] of the two morphisms from $A$ to the [[coproduct]] of $X$ with $Y$ (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpacesIsCoproduct}):

$$
  A 
   \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
  X \sqcup Y
   \longrightarrow
  X \sqcup_A Y
  \,.
$$


If $g$ is an inclusion, one also writes $X \cup_f Y$ and calls this the _attaching space_.

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;"><img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AttachingSpace.jpg" width="450"></div>

By example \ref{CoequalizerInTop} the pushout/attaching space is the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  X \sqcup_A Y \simeq (X\sqcup Y)/\sim
$$

of the [[disjoint union]] of $X$ and $Y$ subject to the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies a point in $X$ with a point in $Y$ if they have the same pre-image in $A$.

(graphics from [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02))

Notice that the defining [[universal property]] of this colimit means that completing the [[span]]

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& Y
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    X
  }
$$

to a [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& Z
  }
$$

is equivalent to finding a morphism

$$
  X \underset{A}{\sqcup} Y \longrightarrow Z

###### Example

An important special case of example \ref{PushoutInTop}: 

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | \; {\vert \vec x \vert \leq 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-disk]] (equipped with its [[subspace topology]] as a subset of [[Cartesian space]]);

* $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | \; {\vert \vec x \vert = 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for its [[boundary]], the standard topological [[n-sphere]].

Notice that $S^{-1} = \emptyset$ and that $S^0 = \ast \sqcup \ast$.

Let 

$$
  i_n \colon S^{n-1}\longrightarrow D^n
$$

be the canonical inclusion of the standard [[n-sphere|(n-1)-sphere]] as the [[boundary]] of the standard [[n-disk]] (both regarded as [[topological spaces]] with their [[subspace topology]] as subspaces of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$).

$$
     D^n \overset{i_n}{\longleftarrow} S^{n-1} \overset{i_n}{\longrightarrow}
     D^n

$$

i.e. the [[pushout]] of $i_n$ along itself, is the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{i_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_n}}\downarrow &(po)& \downarrow

    D^n &\longrightarrow& S^n
  }
  \,.

Another kind of colimit that will play a role for certain technical constructions is [[transfinite composition]]. First recall

+-- {: .num_defn #PosetsWosetTosetsAndOrdinals}
###### Definition

A _[[partial order]]_ is a [[set]] $S$ equipped with a [[relation]] $\leq$ such that for all elements $a,b,c \in S$

1) ([[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]) $a \leq a$;

2) ([[transitive relation|transitivity]]) if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a \leq c$;

3) ([[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]) if $a\leq b$ and $\b \leq a$ then $a = b$. 

This we may and will equivalently think of as a [[category]] with [[objects]] the elements of $S$ and a unique morphism $a \to b$ precisely if $a\leq b$. In particular an order-preserving function between partially ordered sets is equivalently a [[functor]] between their corresponding categories.

A _[[bottom element]]_ $\bot$ in a partial order is one such that $\bot \leq a$ for all a. A _[[top element]]_ $\top$ is one for wich $a \leq \top$.

A partial order is a _[[total order]]_ if in addition

4) ([[total relation|totality]]) either $a\leq b$ or $b \leq a$.

A total order is a _[[well order]]_ if in addition

5) ([[well-founded relation|well-foundedness]]) every non-empty subset has a least element.

An _[[ordinal]]_ is the [[equivalence class]] of a well-order. 

The _[[successor]]_ of an ordinal is the class of the well-order with a [[top element]] freely adjoined.

A _[[limit ordinal]]_ is one that is not a successor.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ExamplesOfOrdinals}
###### Example

The finite ordinals are labeled by $n \in \mathbb{N}$, corresponding to the well-orders $\{0 \leq 1 \leq 2 \cdots \leq n-1\}$. Here $(n+1)$ is the successor of $n$. The first non-empty limit ordinal is $\omega = [(\mathbb{N}, \leq)]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TransfiniteComposition}
###### Definition


Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]], and let $I \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ be a [[class]] of its morphisms. 

For $\alpha$ an [[ordinal]] (regarded as a [[category]]), an $\alpha$-indexed _transfinite sequence_ of elements in $I$ is a [[diagram]]

$$
  X_\bullet 
    \;\colon\; 
  \alpha \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

such that 

1. $X_\bullet$ takes all [[successor]] morphisms $\beta \stackrel{\leq}{\to} \beta + 1$ in $\alpha$ to elements in $I$

   $$
     X_{\beta,\beta + 1} \in I
   $$

1. $X_\bullet$ is _continuous_ in that for every nonzero [[limit ordinal]] $\beta \lt \alpha$, $X_\bullet$ restricted to the [[full subcategory|full-subdiagram]] $\{\gamma \;|\; \gamma \leq \beta\}$ is a [[colimit|colimiting cocone]] in $\mathcal{C}$ for $X_\bullet$ restricted to $\{\gamma \;|\; \gamma \lt \beta\}$.

The corresponding **transfinite composition** is the induced morphism

$$
  X_0 \longrightarrow X_\alpha \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}X_\bullet
$$

into the [[colimit]] of the diagram, schematically:

$$
  \array{
    X_0 &\stackrel{X_{0,1}}{\to}& X_1
    &\stackrel{X_{1,2}}{\to}& X_2
    &\to& \cdots
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow & \cdots 
    \\
    &&
    X_\alpha
  }  
  \,.
$$

=--


We now turn to the discussion of [[mapping spaces]]/[[exponential objects]].


+-- {: .num_defn #CompactOpenTopology}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]] (in that for every point, every neighbourhood contains a compact neighbourhood), the **[[mapping space]]**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]] 

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous 
functions]] $Y \to X$, 

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[finitary intersections]] of [[unions]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U^K \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for 

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

  is the subset of all those [[continuous functions]] $f$ that fit into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

  $$
    \array{
       K &\hookrightarrow& Y
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       U &\hookrightarrow& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

Accordingly this is called the _[[compact-open topology]]_ on the set of functions.

The construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  (-)^{(-)} \;\colon\; Top_{lc}^{op} \times Top \longrightarrow Top
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop #MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]] (in that for each point, each open neighbourhood contains a [[compact subset|compact]] [[neighbourhood]]), the **topological [[mapping space]]** $X^Y$ from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} is an [[exponential object]], i.e. the functor $(-)^Y$ is [[right adjoint]] to the product functor $Y \times (-)$: there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(Z \times Y, X) \simeq Hom_{Top}(Z, X^Y)
$$ 

between continuous functions out of any [[product topological space]] of $Y$ with any $Z \in Top$ and continuous functions from $Z$ into the mapping space.

=--

A proof is spelled out [here](compact-open+topology#GivesExponentialObject) 
(or see e.g. [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, prop. 1.3.1](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)).

+-- {: .num_remark #UseOfHausdorffnessInCOTopology}
###### Remark

In the context of prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} it is often assumed that $Y$ is also a [[Hausdorff topological space]]. But this is not necessary. What assuming Hausdorffness only achieves is that all alternative definitions of "locally compact" become equivalent to the one that is needed for the proposition: for every point, every open neighbourhood contains a compact neighbourhood.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #ProblemWithExponentialsInTop}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} fails in general if $Y$ is not locally compact. Therefore the plain category [[Top]] of all topological spaces is not a [[Cartesian closed category]]. 

This is no problem for the construction of the homotopy theory of topological spaces as such, but it becomes a technical nuisance when comparing it for instance to the [[simplicial homotopy theory]] via the singular [[nerve and realization]] adjunction, since it implies that [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] does not necessarily preserve [[finite limits]].

On the other hand, without changing any of the following discussion one may just pass to a more [[convenient category of topological spaces]] such as notably the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_{ck} \hookrightarrow Top$ (def. \ref{kTop}) which is [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]].

The fundamental concept of [[homotopy theory]] is clearly that of _[[homotopy]]_. In the context of [[topological spaces]] this is about [[continuous function|contiunous]] deformations of [[continuous functions]] parameterized by the standard interval:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInterval}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  I \coloneqq [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

for the standard topological [[interval]], a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]].

Equipped with the canonical inclusion of its two endpoints

$$
  \ast \sqcup \ast \stackrel{(\delta_0,\delta_1)}{\longrightarrow} I \stackrel{\exists !}{\longrightarrow} \ast
$$

this is the standard [[interval object]] in [[Top]].

For $X \in Top$, the [[product topological space]] $X\times I$, example \ref{ProductTopologicalSpace}, is called the standard _[[cylinder object]]_ over $X$. The endpoint inclusions of the interval make it factor the [[codiagonal]] on $X$

$$
  \nabla_X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X \sqcup X

###### Example

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $x,y \in X$ be two of its points, regarded as functions $x,y \colon \ast \longrightarrow X$ from the point to $X$. Then a left homotopy, def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, between these two functions is a commuting diagram of the form

be the [[continuous function]] from the standard interval $I = [0,1]$ to itself that is constant on the value 0. Then there is a left homotopy, def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, from the identity function

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; id_I \Rightarrow const_0
$$

given by

$$
  \eta(x,t) \coloneqq x(1-t)

A key application of the concept of left homotopy is to the definition of [[homotopy groups]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then its set $\pi_0(X)$
of _[[connected components]]_, also called the **0-th homotopy set**, 
is the set of 
[[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] (def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}) of points $x \colon \ast \to X$, hence the set of path-connected components of $X$ (example \ref{PathsAsLeftHomotopyBetweenPoints}). By [[composition]] this extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \pi_0 \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$ and for $x \colon \ast \to X$
any point, then the $n$th **[[homotopy group]]** $\pi_n(X,x)$ of $X$ at $x$
is the [[group]] 

* whose underlying [[set]] is the set of [[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of maps $I^n \longrightarrow X$ that take the [[boundary]] of $I^n$ to $x$ and where the left homotopies $\eta$ are constrained to be constant on the boundary;

* whose [[group]] product operation takes $[\alpha \colon I^n \to X]$ and $[\beta \colon I^n \to X]$ to $[\alpha \cdot \beta]$ with

$$
  \alpha \cdot \beta
  \;\colon\;
  I^n 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  I^n \underset{I^{n-1}}{\sqcup} I^n
  \stackrel{(\alpha,\beta)}{\longrightarrow}
  X
  \,,
$$

where the first map is a [[homeomorphism]] from the unit $n$-[[cube]] to the $n$-cube with one side twice the unit length (e.g. $(x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots) \mapsto (2 x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots)$). 

By [[composition]], this construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \geq 1}
    \;\colon\; 
  Top^{\ast/}
   \longrightarrow 
  Grp^{\mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}}
$$

from [[pointed topological spaces]] to [[graded object|graded]] [[groups]].

Notice that often one writes the value of this functor on a morphism $f$ as $f_\ast = \pi_\bullet(f)$.

###### Remark

At this point we don't go further into the abstract reason why def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces} yields group structure above degree 0, which is that [[positive dimension spheres are H-cogroup objects]]. But this is important, for instance in the proof of the  [[Brown representability theorem]] [below](#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem).

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyEquivalence}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
is called a **[[homotopy equivalence]]** if there exists a 
continuous function the other way around,
$g \;\colon\; Y \longrightarrow X$, and [[left homotopies]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, from the two composites to the identity:

$$
  \eta_1 \;\colon\; f\circ g \Rightarrow_L id_Y
$$

and

$$
  \eta_2 \;\colon\; g\circ f \Rightarrow_L id_X

$$

If here $\eta_2$ is constant along $I$, $f$ is is said to exhibit $X$ as a **[[deformation retract]]** of $Y$.

The composition 

$$
  X \overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow} X\times I \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} X

is immediately the identity on $X$ (i.e. homotopic to the identity by a trivial homotopy), while the composite

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is called  a **[[weak homotopy equivalence]]** if its image under all the [[homotopy group]] functors of def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces} is an [[isomorphism]], hence if 

$$

###### Proposition

Every [[homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence, def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.

In particular a [[deformation retraction]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that for all $X\in$ [[Top]] the inclusion maps 

$$
  X \overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow} X \times I
$$

into the standard [[cylinder object]], def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, are weak homotopy equivalences: by postcomposition with the contracting homotopy of the interval from example \ref{StandardContractionOfStandardInterval} all homotopy groups of $X \times I$ have representatives that factor through this inclusion.

Then given a general [[homotopy equivalence]], apply the homotopy groups functor to the corresponding homotopy diagrams (where for the moment we notationally suppress the choice of basepoint for readability) to get two commuting diagrams

$$
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(X) 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(f)\circ \pi_\bullet(g)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(X \times I) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(\eta)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(Y)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(id)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(X)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(Y) 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(g)\circ \pi_\bullet(f)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(Y \times I) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(\eta)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(X)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\pi_\bullet(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(id)}}
     \\
     \pi_\bullet(Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous observation, the vertical morphisms here are isomorphisms, and hence these diagrams exhibit $\pi_\bullet(f)$ as the inverse of $\pi_\bullet(g)$, hence both as isomorphisms.

+-- {: .num_remark #NotEveryHomotopyEquivalenceIsAWeakHomotopyEquivalence}
###### Remark

The converse of prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} is not true generally: not every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] between topological spaces is a [[homotopy equivalence]].  (For an example with full details spelled out see for instance Fritsch, Piccinini: "Cellular Structures in Topology", p. 289-290).

However, as we will discuss below, it turns out that

1. every weak homotopy equivalence between [[CW-complexes]] is a homotopy equivalence ([[Whitehead's theorem]], cor. \ref{WhiteheadTheorem});

1. every topological space is connected by a weak homotopy equivalence to a CW-complex ([[CW approximation]], remark \ref{EveryTopologicalSpaceWeaklyEquivalentToACWComplex}).

###### Example

For $X\in Top$, the projection $X\times I \longrightarrow X$
from the [[cylinder object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval},
is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.  This means that the factorization 

$$
  \nabla_X 
    \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X
    \stackrel{}{\hookrightarrow}
  X\times I
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}

$$

of the [[codiagonal]] $\nabla_X$ in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, which in general is far from being a [[monomorphism]], may be thought of as factoring it through a monomorphism after replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by $X\times I$.

In fact, further below (prop. \ref{StandardContractionOfStandardInterval}) we see that $X \sqcup X \to X \times I$ has better properties than the generic monomorphism has, in particular better homotopy invariant properties:
it has the [[left lifting property]] against all [[Serre fibrations]] $ E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} B$ that are also [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

=--

Of course the concept of left homotopy in def. \ref{LeftHomotopy} is accompanied by a concept of _[[right homotopy]]_. This we turn to now.



+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalPathSpace}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its **standard topological [[path space object]]** is the topological [[mapping space]] $X^I$, prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}, out of the standard interval $I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}.


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The endpoint inclusion into the standard interval, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, makes the path space $X^I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} factor the [[diagonal]] on $X$ through the inclusion of constant paths and the endpoint evaluation of paths:


$$
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\; 
  X \stackrel{X^{I \to \ast}}{\longrightarrow} X^I \stackrel{X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.
$$

This is the [[formal dual]] to example \ref{TopologicalInterval}. As in that example, below we will see (prop. \ref{TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}) that this factorization has good properties, in that 

1. $X^{I \to \ast}$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]];

1. $X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}$ is a [[Serre fibration]].

So while in general the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X$ is far from being an [[epimorphism]] or even just a [[Serre fibration]], the factorization through the [[path space object]] may be thought of as replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by its path space, such as to turn its diagonal into a Serre fibration after all.

Strictly speaking a relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, is a function $f\colon X \to Y$, _together_ with its cell structure, hence together with the information of the pushout diagrams and the transfinite composition of the pushout maps that exhibit it.

In many applications, however,  all that matters is that there is _some_ (relative) cell decomosition, and then one tends to speak loosely and mean by a (relative) cell complex only a (relative) topological space that admits some cell decomposition.

The following lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}, together with lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} below are the only two statements of the entire development here that involve the [[concrete particular]] nature of [[topological spaces]] ("point-set topology"), everything beyond that is [[general abstract]] homotopy theory.

+-- {: .num_lemma #CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
###### Lemma

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[law of excluded middle]],
every [[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspace]] of a topological [[cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, intersects the [[interior]] of a [[finite number]] of cells.

=--

(e.g. [Hirschhorn 15, section 3.1](#Hirschhorn15))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

So let $Y$ be a topological cell complex and $C \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspace]]. Define a subset 

$$
  P \subset Y
$$ 

by _choosing_ one point in the [[interior]] of the intersection with $C$ of each cell of $Y$ that intersects $C$.

It is now sufficient to show that $P$ has no [[accumulation point]]. Because, by the [[compact topological space|compactness]] of $X$, every non-finite subset of $C$ does have an accumulation point, and hence the lack of such shows that $P$ is a [[finite set]] and hence that $C$ intersects the interior of finitely many cells of $Y$.

To that end, let $c\in C$ be any point. Write $e_c$ for the unique cell of $Y$ that contains $c$ in its [[interior]]. By construction, there is exactly one point of $P$ in the interior of $e_c$. Hence there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $c \in U_c \subset e_c$ containing no further points of $P$ beyond possibly $c$ itself, if $c$ happens to be that single point of $P$ in $e_c$.

It is now sufficient to show that $U_c$ may be enlarged to an open subset $\tilde U_c$ of $Y$ containing no point of $P$, except for possibly $c$ itself, for that means that $c$ is not an accumulation point of $P$.

To that end, let $\alpha_c$ be the [[ordinal]] that labels the stage $Y_{\alpha_c}$ of the [[transfinite composition]] in the [[cell complex]]-presentation of $Y$ at which the cell $e_c$ above appears. Let $\gamma$ be the ordinal of the full cell complex. Then define the set

$$
  T 
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \;
    (\beta, U)
    \;|\;
    \alpha_c \leq \beta \leq \gamma
    \;\,,\;
    U \underset{open}{\subset} Y_\beta
    \;\,,\;
    U \cap Y_\alpha = U_c
    \;\,,\;
    U \cap P \in \{ \emptyset, \{c\} \}
    \;
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

and regard this as a [[partially ordered set]] by declaring a partial ordering via

$$
  (\beta_1, U_1) \lt (\beta_2, U_2)
  \;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;
  \beta_1 \lt \beta_2
  \;\,,\;
  U_2 \cap Y_{\beta_1} = U_1
  \,.
$$

This is set up such that every element $(\beta, U)$ of $T$ with $\beta$ the maximum value $\beta = \gamma$ is an extension $\tilde U_c$ that we are after. 

Observe then that for $(\beta_s, U_s)_{s\in S}$ a chain in $(T,\lt)$ (a subset on which the relation $\lt$ restricts to a [[total order]]), it has an upper bound in $T$ given by the [[union]] $({\cup}_s \beta_s ,\cup_s U_s)$. Therefore [[Zorn's lemma]] applies, saying that $(T,\lt)$ contains a [[maximal element]] $(\beta_{max}, U_{max})$.

Hence it is now sufficient to show that $\beta_{max} = \gamma$. We argue this by showing that assuming $\beta_{\max}\lt \gamma$ leads to a contradiction.

So assume $\beta_{max}\lt \gamma$. Then to construct an  element of $T$ that is larger than $(\beta_{max},U_{max})$, consider for each cell $d$ at stage $Y_{\beta_{max}+1}$ its attaching map $h_d \colon S^{n-1} \to Y_{\beta_{max}}$ and the corresponding preimage open set $h_d^{-1}(U_{max})\subset S^{n-1}$. Enlarging all these  preimages to open subsets of $D^n$ (such that their image back in $X_{\beta_{max}+1}$ does not contain $c$), then $(\beta_{max}, U_{max}) \lt (\beta_{max}+1, \cup_d U_d )$. This is a contradiction. Hence $\beta_{max} = \gamma$, and we are done.

Assume then that the cylinder over all $n$-cells of $X$ has been erected using attachment from $J_{Top}$. Then the union of any $(n+1)$-cell $\sigma$ of $X$ with the cylinder over its boundary is homeomorphic to $D^{n+1}$ and is like the cylinder over the cell "with end and interior removed". Hence via attaching along $D^{n+1} \to D^{n+1}\times I$ the cylinder over $\sigma$ is erected.

###### Lemma

Every $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}) is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $X \longrightarrow \hat X = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{\beta \leq \alpha} X_\beta$ be a $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]]. 

First observe that with the elements $D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ of $J_{Top}$ being [[homotopy equivalences]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (by example \ref{ProjectionFromStandardCylinderIsHomotopyEquivalence}), each of the stages $X_{\beta} \longrightarrow X_{\beta + 1}$ in the relative cell complex is also a homotopy equivalence. We make this fully explicit:

By definition, such a stage is a [[pushout]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
     &\longrightarrow&
     X_\beta
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (id, \delta_0)} }\downarrow 
      &(po)& 
     \downarrow
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
     &\longrightarrow&
     X_{\beta + 1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Then the fact that the projections $p_{n_i} \colon D^{n_i} \times I \to D^{n_i}$ are strict left inverses to the inclusions $(id, \delta_0)$ gives a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
     &\longrightarrow&
     X_\beta
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (id, \delta_0)} }\downarrow 
       && 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} p_{n_i} }}\downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
       &\longrightarrow& 
     X_\beta
  }
$$

and so the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] ([[pushout]]) $X_{\beta + 1}$ gives a factorization of the identity morphism on the right through $X_{\beta + 1}$

$$
  \array{
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
     &\longrightarrow&
     X_\beta
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (id, \delta_0)} }\downarrow 
       && 
     \downarrow^{}
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
       &\longrightarrow&
     X_{\beta + 1}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} p_{n_i} }}\downarrow 
       && 
     \downarrow
     \\
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
       &\longrightarrow& 
     X_\beta
  }
$$

which exhibits $X_{\beta + 1} \to X_\beta$ as a strict left inverse to $X_{\beta} \to X_{\beta + 1}$. Hence it is now sufficient to show that this is also a homotopy right inverse.

To that end, let

$$
  \eta_{n_i} \colon D^{n_i}\times I \longrightarrow D^{n_i} \times I
$$

be the [[left homotopy]] that exhibits $p_{n_i}$ as a homotopy right inverse to $p_{n_i}$ by example \ref{ProjectionFromStandardCylinderIsHomotopyEquivalence}. For each $t \in [0,1]$ consider the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
      &\longrightarrow&
    X_\beta
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
    && X_{\beta + 1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\eta_{n_i}(-,t)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i} \times I
     &\longrightarrow&
    X_{\beta + 1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Regarded as a [[cocone]] under the [[span]] in the top left, the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] ([[pushout]]) $X_{\beta + 1}$ gives a continuous function

$$
  \eta(-,t) \;\colon\; X_{\beta + 1} \longrightarrow X_{\beta + 1}
$$

for each $t \in [0,1]$. For $t = 0$ this construction reduces to the provious one in that $\eta(-,0) \colon X_{\beta +1 } \to X_{\beta} \to X_{\beta + 1}$ is the composite which we need to homotope to the identity; while $\eta(-,1)$ is the identity. 
Since $\eta(-,t)$ is clearly also continuous in $t$ it constitutes a continuous function

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X_{\beta + 1}\times I \longrightarrow X_{\beta + 1}
$$

which exhibits the required left homotopy.


So far this shows that each stage $X_{\beta} \to X_{\beta+1}$ in the [[transfinite composition]] defining $\hat X$ is a [[homotopy equivalence]], hence, by prop.  \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}, a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 

This means that all morphisms in the following diagram (notationally suppressing basepoints and showing only the finite stages)

$$
  \array{
    \pi_n(X)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_n(X_1)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_n(X_2)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_n(X_3)
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \cdots
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & 
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}} & \cdots
    \\
    && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_\alpha \pi_n(X_\alpha)
  }
$$

are isomorphisms.

Moreover, lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} gives that every representative and every null homotopy of elements in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ already exists at some finite stage $X_k$. This means that also the universally induced morphism

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_\alpha \pi_n(X_\alpha)
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_n(\hat X)
$$

is an isomorphism. Hence the composite $\pi_n(X) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_n(\hat X)$ is an isomorphism.

=--





##### Fibrations

Given a relative $C$-cell complex $\iota \colon  X \to Y$, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, it is typically interesting to study the [[extension]] problem along $f$, i.e. to ask which topological spaces $E$ are such that every [[continuous function]] $f\colon X \longrightarrow E$ has an extension $\tilde f$ along $\iota$ 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \tilde f}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If such extensions exists, it means that $E$ is sufficiently "spread out" with respect to the maps in $C$. More generally one considers this extension problem fiberwise, i.e. with both $E$ and $Y$ (hence also $X$) equipped with a map to some base space $B$:


+-- {: .num_defn #RightLiftingProperty}
###### Definition

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and a sub-[[class]] $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]], then a morphism $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms in $C$ if every [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{c}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\

with $c \in C$, has a [[lift]] $h$, in that it may be completed to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

###### Remark

Def. \ref{SerreFibration} says, in view of the definition of [[left homotopy]], that a [[Serre fibration]] $p$ is a map with the property that given a [[left homotopy]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, between two functions into its [[codomain]], and given a lift of one the two functions through $p$, then also the homotopy between the two lifts.
Therefore the condition on a [[Serre fibration]] is also called the _[[homotopy lifting property]]_ for maps whose domain is an [[n-disk]].

More generally one may ask functions $p$ to have such [[homotopy lifting property]] for functions with arbitrary domain. These are called _[[Hurewicz fibrations]]_. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #SerreFibrationsByLiftingAgainstMapsHomeomorphicToDiskInclusions}
###### Remark

The precise shape of $D^n$ and $D^n \times I$ in def. \ref{SerreFibration} turns out not to actually matter much for the nature of Serre fibrations. We will eventually find below (prop. \ref{LiftingPropertyInTheClassicalModelStructureOnTopologicalSpaces}) that what actually matters here is only that the inclusions $D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ are [[relative cell complexes]] (lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes}) and [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}) and that all of these may be generated from them in a suitable way.

But for simple special cases this is readily seen directly, too. Notably we could replace the [[n-disks]] in def. \ref{SerreFibration} with any [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] topological space. A choice important in the comparison to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] ([below](#GeometricRealizationSection)) is to instead take the topological [[n-simplices]] $\Delta^n$. Hence a Serre fibration is equivalently characterized as having lifts in all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Delta^n &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \Delta^n\times I &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Other deformations of the $n$-disks are useful in computations, too. For instance there is a homeomorphism from the $n$-disk to its "cylinder with interior and end removed", formally:

$$
  \array{
    (D^n \times \{0\})\cup (\partial D^n \times I) &\simeq& D^n
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n \times I &\simeq& D^n\times I
  }
$$

and hence $f$ is a Serre fibration equivalently also if it admits lifts in all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    (D^n \times \{0\})\cup (\partial D^n \times I) &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \Delta^n\times I &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.

###### Proposition

Let $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[Serre fibration]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}, let $y \colon \ast \to Y$ be any point and write 

$$
  F_y \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

for the [[fiber]] inclusion over that point. Then for every choice $x \colon \ast \to X$ of lift of the point $y$ through $f$, the induced sequence of [[homotopy groups]]

$$

  \pi_{\bullet}(F_y, x)
    \overset{\iota_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(X, x)
    \overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(Y)
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]], in that the [[kernel]] of $f_\ast$ is canonically identified with the [[image]] of $\iota_\ast$: 

$$
  ker(f_\ast) \simeq im(\iota_\ast)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that the image of $\iota_\ast$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$ (every sphere in $F_y\hookrightarrow X$ becomes constant on $y$, hence contractible, when sent forward to $Y$).

For the converse, let $[\alpha]\in \pi_{\bullet}(X,x)$ be represented by some $\alpha \colon S^{n-1} \to X$. Assume that $[\alpha]$ is in the kernel of $f_\ast$. This means equivalently that $\alpha$ fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $\kappa$ is the contracting homotopy witnessing that $f_\ast[\alpha] = 0$.

Now since $x$ is a lift of $y$, there exists a [[left homotopy]] 

$$
  \eta  \;\colon\; \kappa \Rightarrow const_y
$$ 

as follows:

$$
  \array{
    && S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    && D^n &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,\delta_1)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    D^n &\overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
$$

(for instance: regard $D^n$ as embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is identified with the basepoint on the boundary of $D^n$ and set $\eta(\vec v,t) \coloneqq \kappa(t \vec v)$).

The [[pasting]] of the top two squares that have appeared this way is equivalent to the following commuting square

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\downarrow 
    &&
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^{n-1} \times I 
      &\overset{(\iota_n, id)}{\longrightarrow}& 
    D^n \times I 
      &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Because $f$ is a [[Serre fibration]] and by lemma \ref{CylinderOverCWComplexIsJTopRelativeCellComplex} and prop. \ref{SerreFibrationHasRightLiftingAgainstJTopRelativeCellComplexes}, this has a [[lift]] 

$$
  \tilde \eta \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \times I \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$


Notice that $\tilde \eta$ is a basepoint preserving [[left homotopy]] from $\alpha = \tilde \eta|_1$ to some $\alpha' \coloneqq \tilde \eta|_0$. Being homotopic, they represent the same element of $\pi_{n-1}(X,x)$:

$$
  [\alpha'] = [\alpha]
  \,.
$$

But the new representative $\alpha'$ has the special property that its image in $Y$ is not just trivializable, but trivialized:
combining $\tilde \eta$ with the previous diagram shows that it sits in the following commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \alpha' \colon & S^{n-1} &\overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow}& S^{n-1}\times I &\overset{\tilde \eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\iota_n} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\iota_n,id)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    & D^n &\overset{(id,\delta_0)}{\longrightarrow}& D^n \times I &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    & \downarrow && &&  \downarrow
    \\
    & \ast && \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

The commutativity of the outer square says that $f_\ast \alpha'$ is constant, hence that $\alpha'$ is entirely contained in the fiber $F_y$. Said more abstractly, the [[universal property]] of [[fibers]] gives that $\alpha'$ factors through $F_y\overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X$, hence that $[\alpha'] = [\alpha]$ is in the image of $\iota_\ast$.

The following lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}, together with lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} above, are the only two statements of the entire development here that crucially involve the [[concrete particular]] nature of [[topological spaces]] ("point-set topology"), everything beyond that is [[general abstract]] homotopy theory.

The continuous functions with the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty} against the set $I_{Top} = \{S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow D^n\}$ of topological [[generating cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, are precisely those which are both [[weak homotopy equivalences]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces} as well as [[Serre fibrations]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We break this up into three sub-statements:

**A) $I_{Top}$-injective morphisms are in particular weak homotopy equivalences**

Let $p \colon \hat X \to X$ have the [[right lifting property]] against $I_{Top}$

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1}  &\longrightarrow & \hat X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X
  }
$$

We check that the lifts in these diagrams exhibit $\pi_\bullet(f)$ as being an [[isomorphism]] on all [[homotopy groups]], def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}:


For $n = 0$ the existence of these lifts says that every point of $X$ is in the image of $p$, hence that $\pi_0(\hat X) \to \pi_0(X)$ is [[surjection|surjective]]. Let then $S^0 = \ast \coprod \ast \longrightarrow \hat X$ be a map that hits two connected components, then the existence of the lift says that if they have the same image in $\pi_0(X)$ then they were already the same connected component in $\hat X$. Hence $\pi_0(\hat X)\to \pi_0(X)$ is also [[injection|injective]] and hence is a [[bijection]].

Similarly, for $n \geq 1$, if $S^n \to \hat X$ represents an element in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ that becomes trivial in $\pi_n(X)$, then the existence of the lift says that it already represented the trivial element itself. Hence $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ has trivial [[kernel]] and so is injective. 

Finally, to see that $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ is also surjective, hence bijective, observe that every elements in $\pi_n(X)$ is equivalently represented by a commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& \ast &\longrightarrow& \hat X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X &=& X
  }  
$$

and so here the lift gives a representative of a preimage in $\pi_{n}(\hat X)$.

**B) $I_{Top}$-injective morphisms are in particular Serre fibrations**

By an immediate closure property of lifting problems (we spell this out in generality as prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}, cor. \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} below) an $I_{Top}$-[[injective morphism]] has the [[right lifting property]] against all [[relative cell complexes]], and hence, by lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes}, it is also a $J_{Top}$-injective morphism, hence a Serre fibration.

**C) Acyclic Serre fibrations are in particular $I_{Top}$-[[injective morphisms]]**

([Hirschhorn 15, section 6](#Hirschhorn15)).

Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a Serre fibration that induces isomorphisms
on homotopy groups. In degree 0 this means that $f$ is an isomorphism on [[connected components]], and this means that there is a lift in every [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{-1} = \emptyset &\longrightarrow& X 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^0 = \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

(this is $\pi_0(f)$ being surjective) and in every commuting square of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^0  &\longrightarrow& X 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_0}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^1 = \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

(this is $\pi_0(f)$ being injective). Hence we are reduced to showing that for $n \geq 2$ every diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1}  &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n  &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

has a lift.  


To that end, pick a basepoint on $S^{n-1}$ and write $x$ and $y$ for its images in $X$ and $Y$, respectively 

Then the diagram above expresses that $f_\ast[\alpha] = 0 \in \pi_{n-1}(Y,y)$ and hence by assumption on $f$ it follows that $[\alpha] = 0 \in \pi_{n-1}(X,x)$, which in turn mean that there is $\kappa'$ making the upper triangle of our lifting problem commute:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\kappa'}}
    \\
    D^n
  }
  \,.
$$

It is now sufficient to show that any such $\kappa'$ may be deformed to a $\rho'$ which keeps making this upper triangle commute but also makes the remaining lower triangle commute.

To that end, notice that by the commutativity of the original square, we already have at least this commuting square:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\iota_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \circ \kappa'}}
    \\
    D^n &\underset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This induces the universal map $(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')$ from the [[pushout]] of its [[cospan]] in the top left, which is the [[n-sphere]] (see [this](Top#TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself) example):

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\iota_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow 
    &(po)& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \circ \kappa'}}
    \\
    D^n &\underset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& S^n
    \\
    && & \searrow^{(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')}
    \\
    && && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This universal morphism represents an element of the $n$th homotopy group:

$$
  [(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')]
   \in
  \pi_n(Y,y)
  \,.
$$

By assumption that $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, there is a $[\rho] \in \pi_{n}(X,x)$ with 

$$
  f_\ast [\rho] = [(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')]
$$ 

hence on representatives there is a lift up to homotopy

$$
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\rho}}\nearrow_{\mathrlap{\Downarrow}} & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^n
    &\underset{(\kappa,f\circ \kappa')}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Morever, we may always find $\rho$ of the form $(\rho', \kappa')$ for some $\rho' \colon D^n \to X$. ("Paste $\kappa'$ to the reverse of $\rho$.")

Consider then the map

$$
  S^n \overset{(f\circ \rho', \kappa)}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

and observe that this represents the trivial class:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [(f \circ \rho', \kappa)]
    & =
    [(f\circ \rho', f\circ \kappa')]
     +
      [(f\circ \kappa', \kappa)]
    \\
    & = f_\ast \underset{= [\rho]}{\underbrace{[(\rho',\kappa')]}}
      +
        [(f\circ \kappa', \kappa)]
    \\
    & = [(\kappa,f \circ \kappa')]
      +
        [(f\circ \kappa', \kappa)]
    \\
    & = 0     
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This means equivalently that there is a homotopy

$$
  \phi \; \colon \; f\circ \rho' \Rightarrow \kappa
$$

fixing the boundary of the $n$-disk.

Hence if we denote homotopy by double arrows, then we have now achieved the following situation

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow 
    & 
      {}^{\rho'}\nearrow_{\Downarrow^{\phi}}
    &
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

and it now suffices to show that $\phi$ may be lifted to a homotopy of just $\rho'$, fixing the boundary, for then the resulting homotopic $\rho''$ is the desired lift.

To that end, notice that the condition that $\phi \colon D^n \times I \to Y$ fixes the boundary of the $n$-disk means equivalently that it extends to a morphism

$$
  S^{n-1} \underset{S^{n-1}\times I}{\sqcup} D^n \times I
  \overset{(f\circ \alpha,\phi)}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
$$

out of the [[pushout]] that identifies in the cylinder over $D^n$ all points lying over the boundary. Hence we are reduced to finding a lift in 

$$
  \array{
    D^n &\overset{\rho'}{\longrightarrow}& X 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    S^{n-1}\underset{S^{n-1}\times I}{\sqcup} D^n \times I
    &\overset{(f\circ \alpha,\phi)}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

But inspection of the left map reveals that it is homeomorphic again to $D^n \to D^n \times I$, and hence the lift does indeed exist.

#### Abstract homotopy theory
 {#ModelCategoryTheory}


In the [above](#BackgroundOnTopologicalHomotopyTheoryFromAlgebraicTopology) we discussed three classes of [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]]

1. [[weak homotopy equivalences]];

1. [[relative cell complexes]];

1. [[Serre fibrations]]

and we saw first aspects of their interplay via [[lifting properties]]. 

A fundamental insight due to ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)) is that in fact _all_ constructions in [[homotopy theory]] are elegantly expressible via just the abstract interplay of these classes of morphisms. This was distilled in ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)) into a small set of [[axioms]] called a **[[model category]] structure** (because it serves to make all [[objects]] be _models_ for [[homotopy types]].)

This _abstract homotopy theory_ is the royal road for handling any flavor of [[homotopy theory]], in particular the [[stable homotopy theory]] that we are after below in [Part 1)](#StableHomotopyTheory). Here we discuss the basic constructions and facts in abstract homotopy theory, then [below](#TheClassicalModelStructureOfTopologicalSpaces) we conclude P1) by showing that the above system of classes of maps of topological spaces is indeed an example.

###### Remark

It turns out that a [[category with weak equivalences]], def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}, already determines a [[homotopy theory]]: the one given given by universally forcing weak equivalences to become actual [[homotopy equivalences]]. This may be made precise and is called the _[[simplicial localization]]_ of a category with weak equivalences ([Dwyer-Kan 80a](simplicial+localization#DwyerKanLocalizations), [Dwyer-Kan 80b](simplicial+localization#DwyerKanCalculating), [Dwyer-Kan 80c](simplicial+localization#DwyerKanFunctionComplexes)). However, without further auxiliary structure, these simplicial localizations are in general intractable. The further axioms of a [[model category]] serve the sole purpose of making the universal homotopy theory induced by a [[category with weak equivalences]] be tractable:

such that

1. the class $W$ makes $\mathcal{C}$ into a **[[category with weak equivalences]]**, def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences};

1. The pairs $(W \cap Cof\;,\; Fib)$ and $(Cap\;,\; W\cap Fib)$ are both [[weak factorization systems]], def. \ref{WeakFactorizationSystem}.

One says:

Write $[1] = \{0 \to 1\}$ and $[2] = \{0 \to 1 \to 2\}$ for the [[ordinal numbers]], regarded as [[posets]] and hence as [[categories]]. The [[arrow category]] $Arr(\mathcal{C})$ is equivalently the [[functor category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]} \coloneqq Funct(\Delta[1], \mathcal{C})$, while $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[2]}\coloneqq Funct(\Delta[2], \mathcal{C})$ has as objects pairs of composable morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. There are three injective functors $\delta_i \colon [1] \rightarrow [2]$, where $\delta_i$ omits the index $i$ in its image. 
By precomposition, this induces [[functors]] $d_i  \colon \mathcal{C}^{\Delta[2]} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$. Here

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We go through each item in turn.

**containing isomorphisms**

Given a [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{f}{\rightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}_{\mathllap{\in Iso}}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

with the left morphism an isomorphism, then a [[lift]] is given by using the [[inverse]] of this isomorphism ${}^{{f \circ i^{-1}}}\nearrow$. Hence in particular there is a lift when $p \in K$ and so $i \in K Proj$. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

**closure under composition**

Given a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

consider its [[pasting]] decomposition as

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow 
    &\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now the bottom commuting square has a lift, by assumption. This yields another [[pasting]] decomposition

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow 
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Inj}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

and now the top commuting square has a lift by assumption. This is now equivalently a lift in the total diagram, showing that $p_1\circ p_1$ has the right lifting property against $K$ and is hence in $K Inj$. The case of composing two morphisms in $K Proj$  is [[formal dual|formally dual]]. From this the closure of $K Proj$ under [[transfinite composition]] follows since the latter is given by [[colimits]] of sequential composition and successive lifts against the underlying sequence as above constitutes a [[cocone]], whence the extension of the lift to the colimit follows by its [[universal property]].

**closure under retracts**

Let $j$ be the [[retract]] of an $i \in K Proj$, i.e. let there be a [[commuting diagram]] of the form.

$$
  \array{
    id_A \colon & A &\longrightarrow& C &\longrightarrow& A
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Proj}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}
    \\
    id_B \colon & B &\longrightarrow& D &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Then for 

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{j}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
     \\
     B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

a [[commuting square]], it is equivalent to its [[pasting]] composite with that retract diagram 

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& C &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}_{\mathrlap{\in K Proj}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& D &\longrightarrow& B &\longrightarrow & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the pasting composite of the two squares on the right has a lift, by assumption:

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& C &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}} 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}_{} 
      && 
    \nearrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& D &\longrightarrow& B &\longrightarrow & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By composition, this is also a lift in the total outer rectangle, hence in the original square. Hence $j$ has the left lifting property against all $p \in K$ and hence is in $K Proj$. The other case is [[formal duality|formally dual]].



**closure under pushout and pullback**

Let $p \in K Inj$ and and let 

$$
  \array{
    Z \times_f X &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{{f^* p}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Z &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} & Y 
  }
$$

be a [[pullback]] diagram in $\mathcal{C}$. We need to show that $f^* p$ has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all $i \in K$. So let

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& Z \times_f X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{i}}_{\mathllap{\in K}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathrlap{f^* p}}}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z
  }
$$

be a [[commuting square]]. We need to construct a diagonal lift of that square. To that end, first consider the [[pasting]] composite with the pullback square from above to obtain the commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& Z \times_f X &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^* p}} 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the right lifting property of $p$, there is a diagonal lift of the total outer diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} &{}^{\hat {(f g)}}\nearrow&  \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{f g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]] this gives rise to the lift $\hat g$ in

$$
  \array{
     && Z \times_f X &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     &{}^{\hat g} \nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^* p}} 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

In order for $\hat g$ to qualify as the intended lift of the total diagram, it remains to show that 

$$
  \array{
     A &\longrightarrow& Z \times_f X
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow
     \\
     B
  }
$$

commutes. To do so we notice that we obtain two [[cones]] with tip $A$:

* one is given by the morphisms 
  1. $A \to Z \times_f X \to X$
  2. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} Z$

  with universal morphism into the pullback being

  * $A \to Z \times_f X$

* the other by
  1. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{\hat g}{\to} Z \times_f X \to X$
  2. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} Z$.
  
  with universal morphism into the pullback being
  
  * $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{\hat g}{\to} Z \times_f X$.

The commutativity of the diagrams that we have established so far shows that the first and second morphisms here equal each other, respectively. By the fact that the universal morphism into a pullback diagram is _unique_ this implies the required identity of morphisms.

The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

**closure under (co-)products**

Let $\{(A_s \overset{i_s}{\to} B_s) \in K Proj\}_{s \in S}$ be a set of elements of $K Proj$. Since [[colimits]] in the [[presheaf category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$ are computed componentwise, their [[coproduct]] in this [[arrow category]] is the universal morphism out of the coproduct of objects $\underset{s \in S}{\coprod} A_s$ induced via its [[universal property]] by the set of morphisms $i_s$:

$$
  \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} A_s
  \overset{(i_s)_{s\in S}}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} B_s  
  \,.
$$

Now let 

$$
  \array{
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(i_s)_{s\in S}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

be a [[commuting square]]. This is in particular a [[cocone]] under the [[coproduct]] of objects, hence by the [[universal property]] of the coproduct, this is equivalent to a set of commuting diagrams

$$
  \left\{
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_s}}_{\mathllap{\in K Proj}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \right\}_{s\in S}
  \,.
$$

By assumption, each of these has a lift $\ell_s$. The collection of these lifts

$$
  \left\{
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_s}}_{\mathllap{\in Proj}}\downarrow 
      &{}^{\ell_s}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \right\}_{s\in S}
$$

is now itself a compatible [[cocone]], and so once more by the [[universal property]] of the coproduct, this is equivalent to a lift $(\ell_s)_{s\in S}$ in the original square

$$
  \array{
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} A_s &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(i_s)_{s\in S}}}\downarrow 
     &{}^{(\ell_s)_{s\in S}}\nearrow& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in K}}
    \\
    \underset{s \in S}{\sqcup} B_s
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that the coproduct of the $i_s$ has the left lifting property against all $f\in K$ and is hence in $K Proj$. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

Then every $K$-[[injective morphism]], def. \ref{LiftingAndExtension}, has the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{LiftingAndExtension}, against all $K$-[[relative cell complexes]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex} and their [[retracts]], remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}.

+-- {: .num_remark #RetractsOfMorphisms}
###### Remark

By a [[retract]] of a [[morphism]] $X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ we mean a retract of $f$ as an object in the [[arrow category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$, hence a morphism $A \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} B$ such that in $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$ there is a factorization of the identity on $g$ through $f$

$$
  id_g \;\colon\;
  g \longrightarrow f \longrightarrow g
  \,.
$$

This means equivalently that in $\mathcal{C}$ there is a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$

    \\
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}

###### Lemma
**([[retract argument]])**

Consider a [[composition|composite]] morphism

$$
  f \;\colon\; 
  X \stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow} A \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \,.
$$

1. If $f$ has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, then $f$ is a [[retract]] of $i$.

1. If $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $i$, then $f$ is a [[retract]] of $p$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

We discuss the first statement, the second is [[formal duality|formally dual]].

Write the factorization of $f$ as a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& A 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &= & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the assumed [[lifting property]] of $f$ against $p$ there exists a diagonal filler $g$ making a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& A 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{g}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &= & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By rearranging this diagram a little, it is equivalent to 

$$
  \array{
    & X &=& X 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
     &&
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow 
    \\
    id_Y \colon & Y &\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}& A &\underset{p}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Completing this to the right, this yields a diagram exhibiting the required retract according to remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}:

$$
  \array{
    id_X \colon & X &=& X &=& X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow

    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow

     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow

**Small object argument**

Given a set $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, a natural question is how to factor any given morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ through a relative $C$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $C$-[[injective morphism]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}

$$
  f 
    \;\colon\; 
  X 
    \stackrel{\in C cell}{\longrightarrow} 
  \hat X
    \stackrel{\in C inj}{\longrightarrow} 
  Y
  \,.
$$

A first approximation to such a factorization turns out to be given simply by forming $\hat X = X_1$ by attaching **all** possible $C$-cells to $X$. Namely let

$$
  (C/f) 
   \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
       dom(c) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{c\in C}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       cod(c) &\longrightarrow& Y
    }
  \right\}
$$

be the set of **all** ways to find a $C$-cell attachment in $f$, and consider the [[pushout]] $\hat X$ of the [[coproduct]] of morphisms in $C$ over all these:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &(po)& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    X_1
  }
  \,.
$$

This gets already close to producing the intended factorization: 

First of all the resulting map $X \to X_1$ is a $C$-relative cell complex, by construction. 

Second, by the fact that the coproduct is over all commuting squres to $f$, the morphism $f$ itself makes a [[commuting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

and hence the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] means that $f$ is indeed factored through that $C$-cell complex $X_1$; we may suggestively arrange that factorizing diagram like so:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c)
     &&
    X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow 
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that, finally, the colimiting [[co-cone]] map -- the one that now appears diagonally -- **almost** exhibits the desired right lifting of $X_1 \to Y$ against the $c\in C$. The failure of that to hold on the nose is only the fact that a horizontal map in the middle of the above diagram is missing: the diagonal map obtained above lifts not all commuting diagrams of $c\in C$ into $f$, but only those where the top morphism $dom(c) \to X_1$ factors through $X \to X_1$.

The idea of the [[small object argument]] now is to fix this only remaining problem by iterating the construction: next factor $X_1 \to Y$ in the same way into 

$$
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_2 \longrightarrow Y
$$

and so forth. Since relative $C$-cell complexes are closed under composition, at stage $n$ the resulting $X \longrightarrow X_n$ is still a $C$-cell complex, getting bigger and bigger. But accordingly, the failure of the accompanying $X_n \longrightarrow Y$ to be a $C$-[[injective morphism]] becomes smaller and smaller, for it now lifts against all diagrams where $dom(c) \longrightarrow X_n$ factors through $X_{n-1}\longrightarrow X_n$, which intuitively is less and less of a condition as the $X_{n-1}$ grow larger and larger.

The concept of _[[small object]]_ is just what makes this intuition precise and finishes the small object argument. For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains}
###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[category]] and $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$
a sub-[[set]] of its morphisms, say that these have _small [[domains]]_
if there is an [[ordinal]] $\alpha$ (def. \ref{PosetsWosetTosetsAndOrdinals}) such that for every $c\in C$ and for every $C$-[[relative cell complex]] given by a [[transfinite composition]] (def. \ref{TransfiniteComposition})

$$
  f
  \;\colon\; 
  X \to X_1 \to X_2 \to \cdots  \to X_\beta \to \cdots  \longrightarrow \hat X
$$ 

every morphism  $dom(c)\longrightarrow \hat X$ factors through a stage $X_\beta \to \hat X$ of order $\beta \lt \alpha$:

$$
  \array{
     && X_\beta
     \\
     & \nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     dom(c) &\longrightarrow& \hat X

+-- {: .num_defn #PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}, and $X \in \mathcal{C}$ an [[object]].

* A **[[path space object]]** $Path(X)$ for $X$ is a factorization of the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X \;\colon\; X \to X \times X$ as

where $X\to Path(X)$ is a weak equivalence and $Path(X) \to X \times X$ is a fibration.

* A **[[cylinder object]]** $Cyl(X)$ for $X$ is a factorization of the [[codiagonal]] (or "fold map") $\nabla_X \;\colon\; X \sqcup X \to X$ as

$$
  \nabla_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X \underoverset{\in Cof}{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \underoverset{\in W}{p}{\longrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

where $Cyl(X) \to X$ is a weak equivalence. and $X \sqcup X \to Cyl(X)$ is a cofibration.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #RemarkOnChoicesOfNonGoodPathAndCylinderObjects}
###### Remark

For every object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ in a model category, a cylinder object and a path space object according to def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} exist: the factorization axioms guarantee that there exists

1. a factorization of the [[codiagonal]] as

   $$
     \nabla_X \;\colon\; X \sqcup X \overset{\in Cof}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow} X
   $$

1. a factorization of the diagonal as

   $$
     \Delta_X 
       \;\colon\;
     X

     Path(X)
      \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}
     X \times X
     \,.
   $$

The cylinder and path space objects obtained this way are actually better than required by def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}: in addition to $Cyl(X)\to X$ being just a weak equivalence, for these this is actually an acyclic fibration, and dually in addition to $X\to Path(X)$ being a weak equivalence, for these it is actually an acyclic cofibrations.

Some authors call cylinder/path-space objects with this extra property "very good" cylinder/path-space objects, respectively.

One may also consider dropping a condition in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}: what mainly matters is the weak equivalence, hence some authors take cylinder/path-space objects to be defined as in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} but without the condition that $X \sqcup X\to Cyl(X)$ is a cofibration and without the condition that $Path(X) \to X$ is a fibration. Such authors would then refer to the concept in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} as "good" cylinder/path-space objects.

The terminology in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} follows the original ([Quillen 67, I.1 def. 4](#Quillen67)). With the induced concept of left/right homotopy below in def. \ref{LeftAndRightHomotopyInAModelCategory}, this admits a quick derivation of the key facts in the following, as we spell out below. 

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation}
###### Lemma

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. If $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is cofibrant, then for every [[cylinder object]] $Cyl(X)$ of $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, not only is $(i_0,i_1) \colon X \sqcup X \to X$ a cofibration, but each

$$
  i_0, i_1 \colon X \longrightarrow Cyl(X)
$$

is an acyclic cofibration separately.

Dually, if $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is fibrant, then for every [[path space object]] $Path(X)$ of $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, not only is $(p_0,p_1) \colon Path(X)\to X \times X$ a cofibration, but each

$$
  p_0, p_1 \colon Path(X) \longrightarrow X
$$

is an acyclic fibration separately.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the case of the path space object. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

First, that the component maps are weak equivalences follows generally: by definition they have a [[right inverse]] $Path(X) \to X$ and so this follows by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

But if $X$ is fibrant, then also the two projection maps out of the product $X \times X \to X$ are fibrations, because they are both pullbacks of the fibration $X \to \ast$

$$
  \array{
      X\times X &\longrightarrow& X 
      \\
      \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
      \\
      X &\longrightarrow& \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

hence $p_i \colon Path(X)\to X \times X \to X$ is the composite of two fibrations, and hence itself a fibration, by prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}.

=--



Path space objects are very non-unique as objects up to isomorphism:

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}&  X \times X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     Path_1(X) \underset{X}{\times} Path_2(X) 
     &\longrightarrow&
     Path_1(X)\times Path_2(X)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\downarrow 
     &(pb)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
     \\
     X \times X \times X

     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(pr_1,pr_3)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_1, p_4)}}
     \\
     X\times X &=& X \times X 
  }
$$

gives that the induced projection is again a fibration. Moreover, using lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation} and [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) gives that $X \to Path_1(X) \times_X Path_2(X)$ is a weak equivalence.

For the case of the canonical topological path space objects of def \ref{TopologicalPathSpace}, with $Path_1(X) = Path_2(X) = X^I = X^{[0,1]}$  then this new path space object is $X^{I \vee I} = X^{[0,2]}$, the [[mapping space]] out of the standard interval of length 2 instead of length 1.

That right homotopy (hence also left homotopy) with domain $X$ is a [[transitive relation]] follows from using example \ref{ComposedPathSpaceObjects} to compose path space objects.

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}. Write $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are those objects of $\mathcal{C}$ which are both fibrant and cofibrant;

* [[morphisms]] are the [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, hence the [[equivalence classes]] of morphism under the equivalence relation of prop. \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations};

and whose [[composition]] operation is given on representatives by composition in $\mathcal{C}$.

This is, up to [[equivalence of categories]], the **[[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category of the model category]]** $\mathcal{C}$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} is well defined, in that composition of morphisms between fibrant-cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ indeed passes to [[homotopy classes]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Fix any morphism $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$ between fibrant-cofibrant objects. Then for precomposition

$$
 (-) \circ [f] \;\colon\; Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(Y,Z) \to Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C}(X,Z))}
$$

to be well defined, we need that with $(g\sim h)\;\colon\; Y \to Z$ also $(f g \sim f h)\;\colon\; X \to Z$. But by prop \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations} we may take the homotopy $\sim$ to be exhibited by a right homotopy $\eta \colon Y \to Path(Z)$, for which case the statement is evident from this diagram:

$$
  \array{
    && && Z
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{g}}\nearrow & \uparrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}
    \\
    X 
      &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow} & 
    Y
      &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path(Z)
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{h}}\searrow & \downarrow_{\mathrlap{p_0}}
    \\
    && && Z
  }
  \,.
$$

For postcomposition we may choose to exhibit homotopy by left homotopy and argue [[formal dual|dually]].

We now spell out that def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} indeed satisfies the [[universal property]] that defines the [[localization]] of a [[category with weak equivalences]] at its weak equivalences.

+-- {: .num_lemma #WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}
###### Lemma
**([[Whitehead theorem]] in model categories)**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. A [[weak equivalence]] between two objects which are both fibrant and cofibrant is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--

(e.g. [Goerss-Jardine 99, part I, theorem 1.10](#GoerssJardine99))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the factorization axioms in the model category $\mathcal{C}$ and by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}), every weak equivalence $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ factors through an object $Z$ as an acyclic cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration. In particular it follows that with $X$ and $Y$ both fibrant and cofibrant, so is $Z$, and hence it is sufficient to prove that acyclic (co-)fibrations between such objects are homotopy equivalences.

So let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be an acyclic fibration between fibrant-cofibrant objects, the case of acyclic cofibrations is [[formal dual|formally dual]]. Then in fact it has a genuine [[right inverse]] given by a lift $f^{-1}$ in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\rightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in cof}}\downarrow 
     &{}^{{f^{-1}}}\nearrow& 
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib \cap W}}
    \\
    X &=& X
  }
  \,.
$$

To see that $f^{-1}$ is also a [[left inverse]] up to [[left homotopy]], let $Cyl(X)$ be any [[cylinder object]] on $X$ (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), hence a factorization of the [[codiagonal]] on $X$ as a cofibration followed by a an acyclic fibration 

$$
  X \sqcup X \stackrel{\iota_X}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

and consider the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    X \sqcup X 
    &\stackrel{(f^{-1}\circ f, id)}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_X}}{}_{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(X) &\underset{f\circ p}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which [[commuting square|commutes]] due to $f^{-1}$ being a genuine right inverse of $f$. By construction, this [[commuting square]] now admits a [[lift]] $\eta$, and that constitutes a [[left homotopy]] $\eta \colon f^{-1}\circ f \Rightarrow_L id$.

+-- {: .num_defn #FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}
###### Definition

Given a [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$, consider a _choice_ for each object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ of 

1. a factorization $\emptyset \underoverset{\in Cof}{i_X}{\longrightarrow} Q X \underoverset{\in W \cap Fib}{p_X}{\longrightarrow} X$ of the [[initial object|initial morphism]], such that when $X$ is already cofibrant then $p_X = id_X$;

1. a factorization $X \underoverset{\in W \cap Cof}{j_X}{\longrightarrow} P X \underoverset{\in Fib}{q_X}{\longrightarrow} \ast$ of the [[terminal object|terminal morphism]], such that when $X$ is already fibrant then $j_X = id_X$.

$$
  \gamma_{P,Q}

for the [[functor]] to the homotopy category, def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, which sends an object $X$ to the object $P Q X$ and sends a morphism $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ to the [[homotopy class]] of the result of first lifting in

    {}^{\mathllap{j_{Q X}}}\downarrow &{}^{P Q f}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{q_{Q Y}}}
    \\
    P Q X
    &\longrightarrow&
    \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #ConstructionOfLocalizationFunctorForModelCategoryIsWellDefined}
###### Lemma

The construction in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} is indeed well defined.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, the object $P Q X$ is indeed both fibrant and cofibrant (as well as related by a [[zig-zag]] of weak equivalences to $X$):  

$$
  \array{
     \emptyset 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\in Cof}}
     \\
     Q X &\underset{\in W \cap Cof}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X &\underset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}& \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Now to see that the image on morphisms is well defined. First observe that any two choices $(Q f)_{i}$ of the first lift in the definition are left homotopic to each other, exhibited by lifting in

$$
  \array{
    Q X \sqcup Q X &\stackrel{((Q f)_1, (Q f)_2 )}{\longrightarrow}& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Cof}}\downarrow 
     && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{Y}}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(Q X)
    &\underset{f \circ p_{X} \circ \sigma_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence also the composites $j_{Q Y}\circ (Q_f)_i $ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to each other, and since their domain is cofibrant, then by lemma \ref{LeftHomotopyWithCofibrantDomainImpliesRightHomotopyAndDually} they are also [[right homotopy|right homotopic]] by a right homotopy $\kappa$. This implies finally, by lifting in

$$
  \array{
    Q X &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Path(P Q Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Cof}}\downarrow 
     && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    P Q X &\underset{(R (Q f)_1, P (Q f)_2)}{\longrightarrow}&
    P Q Y \times P Q Y
  }
$$

that also $P (Q f)_1$ and $P (Q f)_2$ are right homotopic, hence that indeed $P Q f$ represents a well-defined [[homotopy class]].

Finally to see that the assignment is indeed [[functor|functorial]], observe that the commutativity of the lifting diagrams for $Q f$ and $P Q f$ imply that also the following diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\overset{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underset{p_y}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underset{j_{Q Y}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now from the [[pasting]] composite 

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\overset{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underset{p_Y}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underset{j_{Q Y}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q g}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q g}}
    \\
    Z &\underset{p_Z}{\longleftarrow}& Q Z &\underset{j_{Q Z}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Z
  }
$$

one sees that $(P Q g)\circ (P Q f)$ is a lift of $g \circ f$ and hence the same argument as above gives that it is homotopic to the chosen $P Q(g \circ f)$. 


=--

For the following, recall the concept of [[natural isomorphism]] between [[functors]]: for $F, G \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ two functors, then a _[[natural transformation]]_ $\eta \colon F \Rightarrow G$ is for each object $c \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a morphism $\eta_c \colon F(c) \longrightarrow G(c)$ in $\mathcal{D}$, such that for each morphism $f \colon c_1 \to c_2$ in $\mathcal{C}$ the following is a [[commuting square]]:

$$
  \array{
    F(c_1) &\overset{\eta_{c_1}}{\longrightarrow}& G(c_1)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{G(f)}}
    \\
    F(c_2) &\underset{\eta_{c_2}}{\longrightarrow}& G(c_2)
  }
  \,.

###### Theorem

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[model category]], the functor $\gamma_{P,Q}$ in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} (for any choice of $P$ and $Q$) exhibits $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ as indeed being the [[localization]] of the underlying [[category with weak equivalences]] at its weak equivalences, in the sense of def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfACategoryWithWeakEquivalences}:

$$
  \array{
     \mathcal{C} &=& \mathcal{C}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\gamma_{P,Q}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma}}
     \\
     Ho(\mathcal{C}) &\simeq& \mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

([Quillen 67, I.1 theorem 1](#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First, to see that that $\gamma$ indeed takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms: By [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) applied to the [[commuting diagrams]] shown in the proof of lemma \ref{ConstructionOfLocalizationFunctorForModelCategoryIsWellDefined}, the morphism $P Q f$ is a weak equivalence if $f$ is:

$$
  \array{
    X &\underoverset{\simeq}{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\underoverset{\simeq}{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& P Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{P Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underoverset{p_y}{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underoverset{j_{Q Y}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& P Q Y
  }
$$

With this the "Whitehead theorem for model categories", lemma \ref{WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}, implies that $P Q f$ represents an isomorphism in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$.

Now let $F \colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow D$ be any functor that sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms. We need to show that it factors as

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{C} && \overset{F}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\gamma}}\searrow &\Downarrow^{\rho}& \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde F}}
    \\
    && Ho(\mathcal{C})
  }
$$

uniquely up to unique [[natural isomorphism]]. Now by construction of $P$ and $Q$ in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, $\gamma_{P,Q}$ is the identity on the [[full subcategory]] of fibrant-cofibrant objects. It follows that if $\tilde F$ exists at all, it must satisfy for all $X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y$ with $X$ and $Y$ both fibrant and cofibrant that 

$$
  \tilde F([f]) \simeq F(f)
  \,,
$$ 

(hence in particular $\tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(f)) = F(P Q f)$).

But by def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} that already fixes $\tilde F$ on all of $Ho(\mathcal{C})$, up to unique [[natural isomorphism]]. Hence it only remains to check that with this definition of $\tilde F$ there exists any [[natural isomorphism]] $\rho$ filling the diagram above. 

To that end, apply $F$ to the above [[commuting diagram]] to obtain

$$
  \array{
    F(X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(p_X)}{\longleftarrow}& F(Q X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(j_{Q X})}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(Q f)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(P Q f)}}
    \\
    F(Y) &\underoverset{F(p_y)}{iso}{\longleftarrow}& F(Q Y) &\underoverset{F(j_{Q Y})}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here now all horizontal morphisms are [[isomorphisms]], by assumption on $F$. It follows that defining $\rho_X \coloneqq F(j_{Q X}) \circ F(p_X)^{-1}$ makes the required natural isomorphism:

$$
  \array{
    \rho_X \colon & F(X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(p_X)^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}& F(Q X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(j_{Q X})}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q X)
   &=&
   \tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(X))
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow 
     && 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(P Q f)}}
     && \downarrow^{\tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(f))}
    \\
    \rho_Y\colon& F(Y) &\underoverset{F(p_y)^{-1}}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(Q Y) &\underoverset{F(j_{Q Y})}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(P Q Y)
   &=&
   \tilde F(\gamma_{P,Q}(X))
  }
  \,.

The following says that for computing the hom-sets in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]], even a mixed variant of the above will do; it is sufficient that the domain is cofibrant and the codomain is fibrant:

([Quillen 67, I.1 lemma 7](#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may factor the morphism in question as the composite

This shows that it is sufficient to see that for $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, then 

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)/_\sim
   \;\colon\; 
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Q Y)/_\sim \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_\sim

  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Y)/_\sim \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_\sim

is an isomorphism. We discuss this for the former; the second is [[formal dual|formally dual]]:

First, that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)$ is surjective is the [[lifting property]] in

which says that any morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ comes from a morphism $\hat f \colon X \to Q Y$ under postcomposition with $Q Y \overset{p_Y}{\to} Y$.

Second, that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)$ is injective is the lifting property in 

$$

###### Remark

While many functors of interest between [[model categories]] are not homotopical in the sense of def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctor}, many become homotopical after restriction to the [[full subcategories]] $\mathcal{C}_f$ [[category of fibrant objects|of fibrant objects]] or $\mathcal{C}_c$ [[category of cofibrant objects|of cofibrant objects]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}. By corollary \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfSubcategoriesOfModelCategoriesOnGoodObjects} this is just as good for the purpose of [[homotopy theory]].

The following proof refers to the [[factorization lemma]], whose full statement and proof we postpone to further below (lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the case of a functor on a [[category of fibrant objects]] $\mathcal{C}_f$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}. The other case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{C}_f$. Choose a [[path space object]] $Path(X)$ (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}) and consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    Path(f) &\underset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_1^\ast f}}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow 
    &(pb)& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    \\
    Path(Y) &\overset{p_1}{\underset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}}& Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p_0}}_{\mathllap{\in W \cap Fib}}\downarrow
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where the square is a [[pullback]] and $Path(f)$ on the top left is our notation for the universal [[cone]] object. (Below we discuss this in more detail, it is the _[[mapping cocone]]_ of $f$, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}). 

Here:

1. $p_i$ are both acyclic fibrations, by lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation};

1. $Path(f) \to X$ is an acyclic fibration because it is the pullback of $p_1$.

1. $p_1^\ast f$ is a weak equivalence, because the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} states that the composite vertical morphism factors $f$ through a weak equivalence, hence if $f$ is a weak equivalence, then $p_1^\ast f$ is by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

Now apply the functor $F$ to this diagram and use the assumption that it sends acyclic fibrations to weak equivalences to obtain

$$
  \array{
    F(Path(f)) &\underset{\in W }{\longrightarrow}& F(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(p_1^\ast f)}}_{\mathllap{}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f)}}
    \\
    F(Path(Y)) &\overset{F(p_1)}{\underset{\in W }{\longrightarrow}}& F(Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(p_0)}}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

But the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma}, in addition says that the vertical composite $p_0 \circ p_1^\ast f$ is a fibration, hence an acyclic fibration by the above. Therefore also $F(p_0 \circ p_1^\ast f)$ is a weak equivalence. Now the claim that also $F(f)$ is a weak equivalence follows with applying [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) twice.

##### Quillen adjunctions
 {#QuillenAdjunctions}

In practice it turns out to be useful to arrange for the assumptions in corollary \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctors} to be satisfied by pairs of [[adjoint functors]]. Recall that this is a pair of [[functors]] $L$ and $R$ going back and forth between two categories

$$
  \mathcal{C}
    \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{D}
$$

such that there is a [[natural bijection]] between [[hom-sets]] with $L$ on the left and those with $R$ on the right:

$$
  \phi_{d,c}
   \;\colon\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(d),c)
   \underoverset{\simeq}{}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(d, R(c))
$$

for all objects $d\in \mathcal{D}$ and $c \in \mathcal{C}$. This being natural means that $\phi \colon Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(L(-),-) \Rightarrow Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-, R(-))$ is a [[natural transformation]], hence that for all morphisms $g \colon d_2 \to d_1$ and $f \colon c_1 \to c_2$ the following is a [[commuting square]]:

$$
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(d_1), c_1)
     & \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_{d_1,c_1}}{\longrightarrow} &
    Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(d_1, R(c_1))
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{L(f) \circ (-)\circ g}}\downarrow 
     && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g\circ (-)\circ R(g)}}
    \\
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(d_2), c_2)
     & \underoverset{\phi_{d_2, c_2}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} &
    Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(d_2, R(c_2))
  }
  \,.
$$

We write $(L \dashv R)$ to indicate an adjunction and call $L$ the _[[left adjoint]]_ and $R$ the _[[right adjoint]]_ of the adjoint pair. 

The archetypical example of a pair of adjoint functors is that consisting of forming [[Cartesian products]] $Y \times (-)$ and forming [[mapping spaces]] $(-)^Y$, as in the category of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] of def. \ref{kTop}.

If $f \colon L(d) \to c$ is any morphism, then the image $\phi_{d,c}(f) \colon d \to R(c)$ is called its _[[adjunct]]_, and conversely. The fact that adjuncts are in bijection is also expressed by the notation

$$
  \frac{
    L(c) \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} d
  }{
    c \overset{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow} R(d)
  }
  \,.
$$

For an object $d\in \mathcal{D}$, the [[adjunct]] of the identity on $L d$ is called the _[[adjunction unit]]_ $\eta_d \;\colon\; d \longrightarrow R L d$.

For an object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the [[adjunct]] of the identity on $R c$ is called the _[[adjunction counit]]_ $\epsilon_c \;\colon\; L R c \longrightarrow c$.

Adjunction units and counits turn out to encode the [[adjuncts]] of all other morphisms by the formulas

* $\widetilde{(L d\overset{f}{\to}c)} = (d\overset{\eta}{\to} R L d \overset{R f}{\to} R c)$

* $\widetilde{(d\overset{g}{\to} R c)} = (L d \overset{L g}{\to} L R c \overset{\epsilon}{\to} c)$.

The conditions in def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction} are indeed all equivalent.

=--

([Quillen 67, I.4, theorem 3](#Quillen67))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that

* (i) _A [[left adjoint]] $L$ between [[model categories]] preserves acyclic cofibrations precisely if its [[right adjoint]] $R$ preserves fibrations.

* (ii) _A [[left adjoint]] $L$ between [[model categories]] preserves cofibrations precisely if its [[right adjoint]] $R$ preserves acyclic fibrations.

We discuss statement (i), statement (ii) is [[formal dual|formally dual]].  So let $f\colon A \to B$ be an acyclic cofibration in $\mathcal{D}$ and $g \colon X \to Y$ a fibration in $\mathcal{C}$. Then for every [[commuting diagram]] as on the left of the following, its $(L\dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] is a commuting diagram as on the right here:

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& R(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R(g)}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& R(Y)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    L(A) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{L(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    L(B) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If $L$ preserves acyclic cofibrations, then the diagram on the right has a [[lift]], and so the $(L\dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] of that lift is a lift of the left diagram. This shows that $R(g)$ has the [[right lifting property]] against all acylic cofibrations and hence is a fibration. 
Conversely, if $R$ preserves fibrations, the same argument run from right to left gives that $L$ preserves acyclic fibrations.

Now by repeatedly applying (i) and (ii), all four conditions in question are seen to be equivalent.

1. For $X \in \mathcal{C}$ a fibrant object and $Path(X)$ a [[path space object]] (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), then $R(Path(X))$ is a path space object for $R(X)$.

1. For $X \in \mathcal{C}$ a cofibrant object and $Cyl(X)$ a [[cylinder object]] (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), then $L(Cyl(X))$ is a path space object for $L(X)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the second case, the first is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

First Observe that  $L(Y \sqcup Y) \simeq L Y \sqcup L Y$ because $L$ is [[left adjoint]] and hence preserves [[colimits]], hence in particular [[coproducts]].

Hence

$$
  L(\X \sqcup X \overset{\in Cof}{\to} Cyl(X))
  =
  (L(X) \sqcup L(X) \overset{\in Cof}{\to } L (Cyl(X)))
$$

is a cofibration.

Second, with $Y$ cofibrant then also $Y \sqcup Cyl(Y)$ is a cofibrantion, since $Y \to Y \sqcup Y$ is a cofibration (lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation}). Therefore by [[Ken Brown's lemma]] (prop. \ref{KenBrownLemma}) $L$ preserves the weak equivalence $Cyl(Y) \overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow} Y$.

By def. \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctorsOnModelCategories} and lemma \ref{HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory} it is sufficient to see that for $X, Y \in \mathcal{C}$ with $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, then there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L X , Y)/_\sim
   \simeq
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, R Y)/_\sim
  \,.
$$

Since by the [[adjoint functor|adjunction isomorphism]] for $(L \dashv R)$ such a natural bijection exists before passing to homotopy classes $(-)/_\sim$, it is sufficient to see that this respects homotopy classes. To that end, use from lemma \ref{LeftRightQuillenFunctorsPreserveCyclinderPathSpaceObjects} that with $Cyl(Y)$ a [[cylinder object]] for $Y$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, then $L(Cyl(Y))$ is a cylinder object for $L(Y)$.

###### Proof

That $1) \Leftrightarrow 2)$ follows from prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories} (if in an adjoint pair one is an equivalence, then so is the other). 

To see the equivalence $1),2) \Leftrightarrow 3)$, notice ([prop.](adjoint+functor#FullyFaithfulAndInvertibleAdjoints)) that a pair of [[adjoint functors]] is an [[equivalence of categories]] precisely if both the [[adjunction unit]] and the [[adjunction counit]] are [[natural isomorphisms]]. Hence it is sufficient to show that the morphisms called "derived adjunction (co-)units" above indeed represent the adjunction (co-)unit of $(\mathbb{L}L \dashv \mathbb{R}R)$ in the homotopy category.
We show this now for the adjunction unit, the case of the adjunction counit is formally dual.

To that end, first observe that for $d \in \mathcal{D}_f$, then the defining commuting square for the left derived functor from def. \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctorsOnModelCategories}

(using fibrant and fibrant/cofirbatn replacement functors $\gamma_P$, $\gamma_{P,Q}$ from def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} with their universal property from theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, corollary \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfSubcategoriesOfModelCategoriesOnGoodObjects}) gives that 

$$
  (\mathbb{L} L ) d \simeq P L P d \simeq P L d \;\;\;\; \in Ho(\mathcal{C})

where the second isomorphism holds because the left Quillen functor $L$ sends the acyclic cofibration $j_d \colon d \to P d$ to a weak equivalence.

The adjunction unit of $(\mathbb{L}L \dashv \mathbb{R}R)$ on $P d \in Ho(\mathcal{C})$ is the image of the identity under

$$
  Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}((\mathbb{L}L) P d, (\mathbb{L} L) P d)
  \overset{\simeq}{\to}
  Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(P d, (\mathbb{R}R)(\mathbb{L}L) P d)
  \,.
$$

By the above and the proof of prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories}, that adjunction isomorphism is equivalently that of $(L \dashv R)$ under the isomorphism

$$
  Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(P L d , P L d)
    \overset{Hom(j_{L d}, id)}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L X, P L X)/_\sim
$$

of lemma \ref{HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory}. Hence the derived adjunction unit is the $(L \dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] of 

$$
  L d 
    \overset{j_{L d}}{\longrightarrow}
  P L d
    \overset{id}{\to}
  P L d
  \,,
$$

which indeed (by the formula for [[adjuncts]]) is 

$$
  X 
    \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
  R L d 
    \overset{R (j_{L d})}{\longrightarrow}
  R P L d 
  \,.
$$

To see that $4) \Rightarrow 3)$:

Consider the weak equivalence $L X \overset{j_{L X}}{\longrightarrow} P L X$. Its $(L \dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] is

$$
  X 
    \overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}
  R L X 
    \overset{R j_{L X}}{\longrightarrow}
  R P L X 
$$

by assumption 4) this is again a weak equivalence, which is the requirement for the derived unit in 3). Dually for derived counit.

To see $3) \Rightarrow 4)$: 

Consider any $f \colon L d \to c$ a weak equivalence for cofibrant $d$, firbant $c$. Its [[adjunct]] $\tilde f$ sits in a commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \tilde f \colon & d &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&  R L d &\overset{R f}{\longrightarrow}& R c
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{=}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R j_{L d}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R j_c}} 
    \\
    & d &\underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& R P L d &\overset{R P f}{\longrightarrow}& R P c
  }
  \,,
$$

where $P f$ is any lift constructed as in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}.

This exhibits the bottom left morphism as the derived adjunction unit, hence a weak equivalence by assumption. But since $f$ was a weak equivalence, so is $P f$ (by [[two-out-of-three]]).  Thereby also $R P f$ and $R j_Y$, are weak equivalences by [[Ken Brown's lemma]] \ref{KenBrownLemma} and the assumed fibrancy of $c$. Therefore by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) also the [[adjunct]] $\tilde f$ is a weak equivalence.

Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $I_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, hence just a plain relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, followed by an $I_{Top}$-[[injective morphisms]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}:

###### Proof

By lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
the set $J_{Top} = \{D^n \hookrightarrow D^n\times I\}$ of 
topological [[generating acyclic cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, has small domains, in the sense of def. \ref{ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains} (the [[n-disks]] are [[compact topological space|compact]]). Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $J_{Top}$-[[relative cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $J_{top}$-[[injective morphisms]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}:

By definition this makes $\hat X \to Y$ a [[Serre fibration]], hence a fibration.

By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex is in particular a relative $I_{Top}$-cell complex. Hence $X \to \hat X$ is a classical cofibration. By lemma \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} it is also a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], hence a clasical weak equivalence.

admits a [[lift]] as soon as one of the two is also a classical weak equivalence.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

**A)** If the fibration $f$ is also a weak equivalence, then lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} says that it has the right lifting property against the generating cofibrations $I_{Top}$, and cor. \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies the claim.

**B)** If the cofibration $g$ on the left is also a weak equivalence, consider any factorization into a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a fibration,

$$
  g \;\colon\; \stackrel{\in J_{Top} Cell}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{\in Fib_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}
  \,,
$$

as in the proof of lemma \ref{ContinuousFunctionsFactorAsQuillenAcyclicCofibrationFollowedBySerreFibration}. By lemma \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} the morphism $\overset{\in J_{Top} Cell}{\longrightarrow}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, and so by [[two-out-of-three]] (prop. \ref{QuillenWeakEquivalencesSatisfyTwoOutOfThree}) the factorizing fibration is actually an acyclic fibration. By case A), this acyclic fibration has the [[right lifting property]] against the cofibration $g$ itself, and so the [[retract argument]], lemma \ref{RetractArgument} gives that $g$  is a [[retract]] of a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex. With this, finally cor. \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies that $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $g$.

=--

Finally:

+-- {: .num_prop #LiftingExhausted}
###### Proposition

The systems $(Cof_{cl} , W_{cl} \cap Fib_{cl})$ and $(W_{cl} \cap Cof_{cl}, Fib_{cl})$ from def. \ref{ClassesOfMorhismsInTopQuillen} are [[weak factorization systems]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since we have already seen the factorization property (lemma \ref{FactorizationInTopQuillen}, lemma \ref{ContinuousFunctionsFactorAsQuillenAcyclicCofibrationFollowedBySerreFibration}) and the lifting properties (lemma \ref{LiftingPropertyInTheClassicalModelStructureOnTopologicalSpaces}), it only remains to see that the given left/right classes exhaust the class of morphisms with the given lifting property. 

For the classical fibrations this is by definition, for the the classical acyclic fibrations this is by lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}.

The remaining statement for $Cof_{cl}$ and $W_{cl}\cap Cof_{cl}$ follows from a general argument ([here](cofibrantly+generated+model+category#RetractsOfCellComplexesExchaustLLPOfRLP)) for [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] (def. \ref{CofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory}), which we spell out:

So let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be in $(I_{Top} Inj) Proj$, we need to show that then $f$ is a retract (remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}) of a [[relative cell complex]]. To that end, apply the [[small object]] argument as in lemma \ref{FactorizationInTopQuillen} to factor $f$ as 

$$
  f \;\colon \; X \overset{I_{Top} Cell}{\longrightarrow} \hat Y \overset{\in I_{Top} Inj}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \,.
$$

It follows that $f$ has the [[left lifting property]] against $\hat Y \to Y$, and hence by the [[retract argument]] (lemma \ref{RetractArgument}) it is a retract of $X \overset{I Cell}{\to} \hat Y$. This proves the claim for $Cof_{cl}$.

The argument for $W_{cl} \cap Cof_{cl}$ is directly analogous, using the [[small object argument]] now for $J_{Top}$.

=--


In conclusion, prop. \ref{QuillenWeakEquivalencesSatisfyTwoOutOfThree} and prop. \ref{LiftingExhausted} say that:

+-- {: .num_theorem #TopQuillenModelStructure} 
###### Theorem

The classes of morphisms in $Mor(Top)$ of def.  \ref{ClassesOfMorhismsInTopQuillen},

* $W_{cl} = $ [[weak homotopy equivalences]],

* $Fib_{cl} = $ [[Serre fibrations]] 

* $Cof_{cl} = $ [[retracts]] of [[relative cell complexes]]

define a [[model category]] structure (def. \ref{ModelCategory}) $Top_{Quillen}$, the **[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]** or **Serre-Quillen model structure** .

=--

In particular

1. every object in $Top_{Quillen}$ is fibrant;

1. the cofibrant object in $Top_{Quillen}$ are the [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]].

Hence in particular the following classical statement is an immediate corollary:

+-- {: .num_cor #WhiteheadTheorem} 
###### Corollary
**(Whitehead theorem)**

Every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] (def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}) between [[topological spaces]] that are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[retract]] of a [[cell complex]], in particular to a [[CW-complex]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}), is a [[homotopy equivalence]] (def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is the "Whitehead theorem in model categories", lemma \ref{WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}, specialized to $Top_{Quillen}$ via theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}.

=--


In proving theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} we have in fact shown a bit more that stated. Looking back, all the structure of $Top_{Quillen}$ is entirely induced by the set $I_{Top}$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}) of generating cofibrations and the set $J_{Top}$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}) of generating acyclic cofibrations (whence the terminology). This phenomenon will keep recurring and will keep being useful as we construct further model categories, such as the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]] (def. \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnPointedTopologicalSpaces}), the [[projective model structure on enriched functors|projective model structure on topological functors]] (thm. \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors}), and finally various [[model structures on spectra]] which we turn to in the [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1|section on stable homotopy theory]]. 

Therefore we make this situation explicit:

+-- {: .num_defn #CofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory} 
###### Definition

A [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{ModelCategory}) is called **cofibrantly generated** if there exists two subsets

$$
  I, J \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})
$$

of its class of morphisms, such that 

1. $I$ and $J$ have small domains according to def. \ref{ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains}, 

1.  the (acyclic) cofibrations of $\mathcal{C}$ are precisely the [[retracts]], of $I$-[[relative cell complexes]] ($J$-relative cell complexes), def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}.

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a cofibrantly generated model category, def. \ref{CofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory}, with generating (acylic) cofibrations $I$ ($J$), then its classes $W, Fib, Cof$ of weak equivalences, fibrations and cofibrations are equivalently expressed as [[injective or projective morphisms]] (def. \ref{LiftingAndExtension}) this way:


1. $Cof = (I Inj) Proj$

1. $W \cap Fib = I Inj$;

1. $W \cap Cof = (J Inj) Proj$;

1. $Fib = J Inj$;


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear from the definition that $I \subset (I Inj) Proj$, so that the closure property of prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms} gives an inclusion

$$
  Cof \subset (I Inj) Proj
  \,.
$$

For the converse inclusion, let $f \in (I Inj) Proj$. By the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, there is a factorization $f\colon \overset{\in I Cell}{\longrightarrow}\overset{I Inj}{\longrightarrow}$. Hence by assumption and by the [[retract argument]] lemma \ref{RetractArgument}, $f$ is a retract of an $I$-relative cell complex, hence is in $Cof$.

This proves the first statement. Together with the closure properties of prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}, this implies the second claim.

The proof of the third and fourth item is directly analogous, just with $J$ replaced for $I$.

##### The classical homotopy category
 {#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory}

With the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] in hand, we now have good control over the [[classical homotopy category]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClassicalHomotopyCategory} 
###### Definition

The **Serre-Quillen [[classical homotopy category]]** is the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]], def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] $Top_{Quillen}$ from theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}: we write 

$$
  Ho(Top) \coloneqq Ho(Top_{Quillen}) 
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #EveryTopologicalSpaceWeaklyEquivalentToACWComplex} 
###### Remark

From just theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}, the definition \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} (def. \ref{ClassicalHomotopyCategory}) gives that 

$$
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}) \simeq (Top_{Retract(Cell)})/_\sim
$$

is the category whose objects are [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}) and whose morphisms are [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]]. But in fact more is true:


Theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} in itself implies that every topological space is weakly equivalent to a [[retract]] of a [[cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}. But by the existence of [[CW approximations]], this cell complex may even be taken to be a [[CW complex]]. 

Better yet, by the [[Quillen equivalence]] to the [[Quillen model structure on simplicial sets]] (discussed [below](#SimplicialSets)) every topological space is weakly homotopy equivalent to the [[geometric realization]] ${\vert Sing X \vert}$ of its [[singular simplicial complex]] $Sing X$, and every geometric realization of a [[simplicial set]] is (by [this proposition](geometric+realization#mono)) even a [[CW-complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}. Hence the $({\vert -\vert} \dashv Sing)$-[[adjunction unit]] yields a _functorial_ [[CW approximation]]

$$
  {\vert Sing X\vert} \overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

(prop. \ref{UnitOfSingularNerveAndRealizationIsWEOnKanComplexes}).

Hence  the Serre-Quillen [[classical homotopy category]] is also equivalently the category of just the [[CW-complexes]] whith [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]] between them

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Ho(Top_{Quillen}) & \simeq (Top_{Retract(Cell)})/_\sim
    \\
    & \simeq (Top_{CW})/_{\sim}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

It follows that the [[universal property]] of the homotopy category (theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory})

$$
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}) \simeq Top[W_{cl}^{-1}]
$$

implies that there is a bijection, up to [[natural isomorphism]], between

1. functors out of $Top_{CW}$ which agree on homotopy-equivalent maps;

1. functors out of all of $Top$ which send weak homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms.

This statement in particular serves to show that two different axiomatizations of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories are equivalent to each other. See at _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- S]]_ the section _[generalized cohomology functors](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors)_ ([this prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent))

**Beware** that, by remark \ref{NotEveryHomotopyEquivalenceIsAWeakHomotopyEquivalence}, what is **not** equivalent to $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$ is the category 

$$
  hTop \coloneqq Top/_\sim
$$

obtained from _all_ topological spaces with morphisms the homotopy classes of continuous functions. This category is "too large", the correct homotopy category is just the genuine [[full subcategory]]

$$
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}) 
   \simeq 
  (Top_{Retract(Cell)})/_\sim
   \simeq
  Top/_\sim
    =
  \hookrightarrow hTop
  \,.
$$

Beware also the ambiguity of terminology: "classical homotopy category" some literature refers to $hTop$ instead of $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$. However, here we never have any use for $hTop$ and will not mention it again.

$$ 

(obtained by forming the [[product]] with the standard topological intervall $I = [0,1]$) is indeed a _[[cylinder object]]_ in the abstract sense of def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We describe the proof informally. It is immediate how to turn this into a formal proof, but the notation becomes tedious. (One place where it is spelled out completely is [Ottina 14, prop. 2.9](cylinder+object#Ottina14).)

So let $X_0 \to X_1 \to X_2\to \cdots \to X$ be a presentation of $X$ as a CW-complex. Proceed by induction on the cell dimension. 

First observe that the cylinder $X_0 \times I$ over $X_0$ is a cell complex: First $X_0$ itself is a disjoint union of points. Adding a second copy for every point (i.e. attaching along $S^{-1}\to D^0$) yields $X_0 \sqcup X_0$, then attaching an inteval between any two corresponding points (along $S^0 \to D^1$) yields $X_0 \times I$.

So assume that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ it has been shown that $X_n \times I$ has the structure of a CW-complex of dimension $(n+1)$. Then for each cell of $X_{n+1}$, attach it _twice_ to $X_n \times I$, once at $X_n \times \{0\}$, and once at $X_n \times \{1\}$.

The result is $X_{n+1}$ with a _hollow cylinder_ erected over each of its $(n+1)$-cells. Now fill these hollow cylinders (along $S^{n+1} \to D^{n+1}$) to obtain $X_{n+1}\times I$.

This completes the induction, hence the proof of the CW-structure on $X\times I$.

The construction also manifestly exhibits the inclusion $X \sqcup X \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow}$ as a [[relative cell complex]].

Finally, it is clear (prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}) that $X \times I \to X$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.

=--

Conversely:

+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}

    \overset{(X^{\delta_0}, X^{\delta_1})}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times X
$$

(obtained by forming the [[mapping space]], def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}, with the standard topological intervall $I = [0,1]$) is indeed a _[[path space object]]_ in the abstract sense of def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that $const \colon X\to X^I$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] it is sufficient, by prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}, to exhibit a [[homotopy equivalence]]. Let the homotopy inverse be $X^{\delta_0} \colon X^I \to X$. Then the composite

$$
  X \overset{const}{\longrightarrow} X^I \overset{X^{\delta_0}}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

is already equal to the identity. The other we round, the rescaling of paths provides the required homotopy

$$
  \array{
    I \times X^I &\overset{(t,\gamma)\mapsto \gamma(t\cdot(-))}{\longrightarrow}& 
    X^I
  }
  \,.
$$


To see that $X^I \to X\times X$ is a fibration, we need to show that every commuting square of the form

$$
  \array{
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X^I
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_0}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{}
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& X \times X
  }
$$

has a lift. 

Now first use the [[adjunction]] $(I \times (-))\dashv (-)^I$ from prop. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} to rewrite this equivalently as the following commuting square:

$$
  \array{
    D^n \sqcup D^n 
      &\overset{(i_0, i_0)}{\longrightarrow}& 
    (D^n \times I) \sqcup (D^n \times I)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(i_0, i_1)}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& X
  }
  \,.
$$

This square is equivalently (example \ref{PushoutInTop}) a morphism out of the [[pushout]]

$$
  D^n \times I 
    \underset{D^n \sqcup D^n }{\sqcup}
  (D^n \times I) \sqcup (D^n \times I)
  \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

By the same reasoning, a lift in the original diagram is now equivalently a lifting in 

$$
  \array{
    D^n \times I 
      \underset{D^n \sqcup D^n }{\sqcup}
    (D^n \times I) \sqcup (D^n \times I)
    &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    (D^n \times I)\times I &\longrightarrow& \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

Inspection of the component maps shows that the left vertical morphism here is the inclusion into the square times $D^n$ of three of its faces times $D^n$. This is homeomorphic to the inclusion $D^{n+1} \to D^{n+1} \times I$ (as in remark \ref{SerreFibrationsByLiftingAgainstMapsHomeomorphicToDiskInclusions}). Therefore a lift in this square exsists, and hence a lift in the original square exists.

##### Model structure on pointed topological spaces

A _[[pointed object]]_ $(X,x)$ is of course an [[object]] $X$ equipped with a [[point]] $x \colon \ast \to X$, and a morphism of pointed objects $(X,x) \longrightarrow (Y,y)$ is a morphism $X \longrightarrow Y$ that takes $x$ to $y$. Trivial as this is in itself, it is good to record some basic facts, which we do here. 

Passing to pointed objects is also the first step in linearizing classical homotopy theory to [[stable homotopy theory]]. In particular, every category of pointed objects has a [[zero object]], hence has [[zero morphisms]]. And crucially, if the original category had [[Cartesian products]], then its pointed objects canonically inherit a non-cartesian [[tensor product]]: the [[smash product]]. These ingredients will be key below in [Part 1)](#StableHomotopyTheory).

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] and let $X \in \mathcal{C}$ be an [[object]]. 

The _[[slice category]]_ $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ is the category whose 

* objects are morphisms $\array{A \\ \downarrow \\ X}$ in $\mathcal{C}$;

* morphisms are [[commuting diagram|commuting triangles]] $\array{ A && \longrightarrow && B \\ & {}_{}\searrow && \swarrow \\ && X}$ in $\mathcal{C}$.

Dually, the _[[coslice category]]_ $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$ is the category whose

* objects are morphisms $\array{X \\ \downarrow \\ A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$;

* morphisms are [[commuting diagram|commuting triangles]] $\array{ && X \\ & \swarrow && \searrow \\ A && \longrightarrow && B }$ in $\mathcal{C}$.

There is the canonical [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  U \;\colon \; \mathcal{C}_{/X}, \mathcal{C}^{X/} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

given by forgetting the morphisms to/from $X$.

* objects are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\ast \overset{x}{\to} X$ (hence an object $X$ equipped with a choice of point; i.e. a _[[pointed object]]_);

* morphisms are [[commuting diagram|commuting triangles]] of the form

  $$

In this situation one says that $\ast$ is a _[[zero object]]_ and that $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ is a _[[pointed category]]_.

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]] and let $X \in \mathcal{C}$ be an [[object]]. Then both the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ as well as the [[coslice category]] $\mathcal{C}^{X/}$, def. \ref{SliceCategory}, carry model structures themselves -- the **[[model structure on a slice category|model structure on a (co-)slice category]]**,  where a morphism is a weak equivalence, fibration or cofibration iff its image under the [[forgetful functor]] $U$ is so in $\mathcal{C}$.

In particular the category $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ of [[pointed objects]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, in a model category $\mathcal{C}$ becomes itself a model category this way. The corresponding [[homotopy category of a model category]], def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, we call the **[[pointed category|pointed]] [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]]** $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] with all [[limits]] and [[colimits]]. Then also the [[category of pointed objects]] $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$, def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, has all limits and colimits.

Moreover:

1. the limits are the limits of the underlying diagrams in $\mathcal{C}$, with the base point of the limit induced by its universal property in $\mathcal{C}$;

1. the colimits are the limits in $\mathcal{C}$ of the diagrams _with the basepoint adjoined_.

Given two pointed objects $(X,x)$ and $(Y,y)$, then:

1. their [[coproduct]] in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ has to be computed using the second clause in prop. \ref{LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects}: since the point $\ast$ has to be adjoined to the diagram, it is given not by the coproduct in $\mathcal{C}$, but by the [[pushout]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form:

   $$
     \array{

   $$

   This is called the _[[wedge sum]]_ operation on pointed objects.

Generally for a set $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ in $Top^{\ast/}$

1. their [[product]] is formed in $Top$ as in example \ref{ProductTopologicalSpace}, with the new basepoint canonically induced;

1. their [[coproduct]] is formed by the [[colimit]] in $Top$ over the diagram with a basepoint adjoined, and is called the [[wedge sum]] $\vee_{i \in I} X_i$.

$$
  X \wedge (I_+) = (X \times I)/(\{x_0\} \times I)

is the **[[reduced cylinder]]** over $X$: the result of forming the ordinary cyclinder over $X$ as in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, and then identifying the interval over the basepoint of $X$ with the point.

(Generally, any construction in $\mathcal{C}$ properly adapted to pointed objects $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ is called the "reduced" version of the unpointed construction. Notably so for "[[reduced suspension]]" which we come to [below](#MappingCones).)


Just like the ordinary cylinder $X\times I$ receives a canonical injection from the [[coproduct]] $X \sqcup X$ formed in $Top$, so the reduced cyclinder receives a canonical injection from the coproduct $X \sqcup X$ formed in $Top^{\ast/}$, which is the [[wedge sum]] from example \ref{WedgeSumAsCoproduct}:

##### Model structure on compactly generated topological spaces

The category [[Top]] has the technical inconvenience that [[mapping spaces]] $X^Y$ (def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}) exist only for $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]] but fail to exist more generally. In other words: [[Top]] is not [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. But cartesian closure is necessary for some purposes of homotopy theory, for instance it ensures that

1. the [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]] is [[associative]];

1. there is a concept of [[topologically enriched functors]] with values in topological spaces, to which we turn [below](#ModelStructureOnTopEnrichedFunctors).

1. [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] preserves [[products]].

Now, since, by the above, the [[homotopy theory]] of topological spaces only cares about the [[CW approximation]] to any topological space, it is plausible to ask for a [[full subcategory]] of [[Top]] which still contains all [[CW-complexes]], still has all [[limits]] and [[colimits]], still supports a model category structure constructed in the same way as above, but which in addition is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], and preferably such that the model structure interacts well with the cartesian closure.

Such a full subcategory exists, the category of [[compactly generated topological spaces]]. This we briefly describe now.

with $k$ from def. \ref{kfication}.

For $X \in Top_{cg}$ there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(X,Y) \simeq Hom_{Top_{cg}}(X, k(Y))
  \,,
$$

which means equivalently that the functor $k$ (def. \ref{kfication}) together with the inclusion from def. \ref{kTop} forms an pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  Top
    \stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\underoverset{k}{\bot}{\longleftarrow}}
  Top_{cg}
  \,.
$$

This in turn means equivalently that $Top_{cg} \hookrightarrow Top$ is a [[coreflective subcategory]] with coreflector $k$. In particular $k$ is [[idempotent monad|idemotent]] in that there are [[natural isomorphisms|natural]] [[homeomorphisms]]

$$
  k(k(X))\simeq k(X)
  \,.
$$

Hence [[colimits]] in $Top_{cg}$ exists and are computed as in [[Top]]. Also [[limits]] in $Top_{cg}$ exists, these are obtained by computing the limit in [[Top]] and then applying the functor $k$ to the result.

for every $X \in Top_{cg}$ then the operation $X\times (-) \times (-)\times X$ of forming the Cartesian product in $Top_{cg}$ (which by cor. \ref{kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory} is $k$ applied to the usual [[product topological space]]) together with the operation $(-)^X$ of forming the compactly generated [[mapping space]] (def. \ref{CompactlyGeneratedMappingSpaces}) forms a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

###### Proposition

Write $Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$ for the category of [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological spaces]] (def. \ref{kTop}). Then the [[smash product]]

$$
  (-)\wedge (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}
    \times
  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}
    \longrightarrow
  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}
$$

is [[associativity|associative]] and the [[0-sphere]] is a [[tensor unit]] for it, hence $(Top_{cg}^{\ast/}, \wedge, S^0)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]].

Moreover together with the [[pointed mapping space]] version $(-)_\ast^X$ of the compactly generated mapping space of def. \ref{CompactlyGeneratedMappingSpaces}, $Top_{cg}^{\ast}$ becomes a [[closed monoidal category]]: 

for every $X \in Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$ then the operations of forming the [[smash product]] $X\wedge (-)$ and of forming the [[pointed mapping space]] $(-)_\ast^X$ constitute a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}

  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For the first statement, since $(-)\times X$ is a [[left adjoint]] by prop. \ref{CartesianClosureOfTopcg}, it presevers [[colimits]] and in particular [[quotient space]] projections. Therefore with $X, Y, Z \in Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$ then

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (X \wedge Y) \wedge Z
    & =
    \frac{
      \frac{X\times Y}{X \times\{y\} \sqcup \{x\}\times Y}
      \times Z
    }{ (X \wedge Y)\times \{z\} \sqcup \{[x] = [y]\} \times Z}
    \\
    & \simeq
    \frac{\frac{X \times Y \times Z}{X \times \{y\}\times Z \sqcup \{x\}\times Y \times Z}}{
      X \times Y \times \{z\}
    }
   \\
   &\simeq
    \frac{X\times Y \times Z}{ X \vee Y \vee Z}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The analogous reasoning applies to yield also $X \wedge (Y\wedge Z) \simeq \frac{X\times Y \times Z}{ X \vee Y \vee Z}$.

##### Model structure on topological functors

With classical topological homotopy theory in hand, it is straightforward now to generalize this to a homotopy theory of _topological diagrams_. This is going to be the basis for the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]], for spectra may be identified with certain topological diagrams.

Technically, "topological diagram" here mean "[[Top]]-[[enriched functor]]". We now discuss what this means and then observe that as an immediate corollary of theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} we obtain a model category structure on topological diagrams.

In the following we say _[[Top]]-[[enriched category]]_ and _[[Top]]-[[enriched functor]]_ etc. for what often is referred to as "[[topological category]]" and "[[topological functor]]" etc. As discussed there, these latter terms are ambiguous.


+-- {: .num_defn #TopEnrichedCategory}
###### Definition

A **[[topologically enriched category]]** $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[Top]]-[[enriched category]], hence:

1. a [[class]] $Obj(\mathcal{C})$, called the **class of [[objects]]**;

1. for each $a,b\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a topological space 

   $$
     \mathcal{C}(a,b)\in Top
     \,,
   $$

   called the **space of [[morphisms]]** or the **[[hom-space]]** between $a$ and $b$;

1. for each $a,b,c\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a [[continuous function]]

   $$
     \circ_{a,b,c} \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(a,b)\times \mathcal{C}(b,c) \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}(a,c)
   $$

   out of the [[product topological space]], called the _[[composition]]_ operation

1. for each $a \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a point $Id_a\in \mathcal{C}(a,a)$, called the _[[identity]]_ morphism on $a$

such that the composition is [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]].

Similarly a **pointed topologically enriched category** is such a structire with $Top_k$ replaced by [[pointed topological spaces]] and with the [[Cartesian product]] replaced by the [[smash product]] of pointed topological spaces.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #UnderlyingCategoryOfTopEnrichedCategory}
###### Remark

Given a (pointed) [[topologically enriched category]] as in def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory}, then forgetting the topology on the [[hom-spaces]] (along the [[forgetful functor]] $U \colon Top_k \to Set$) yields an ordinary [[locally small category]] with

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(a,b) = U(\mathcal{C}(a,b))
  \,.
$$

It is in this sense that $\mathcal{C}$ is a category with [[extra structure]], and hence "[[enriched category|enriched]]".
 
=---

The archetypical example is the following:

+-- {: .num_example #TopkAsATopologicallyEnrichedCategory}
###### Example

Write 

$$
  Top_k \hookrightarrow Top
$$ 

for the [[full subcategory]] of [[Top]] on the [[compactly generated topological spaces]]. Under forming [[Cartesian product]] 

$$
  (-)\times (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Top_k \times Top_k \longrightarrow Top_k
$$


and [[mapping spaces]] 

$$
  (-)^{(-)}
  \;\colon\;
  Top_k^{op}\times Top_k
  \longrightarrow
  Top_k
$$

this is a [[cartesian closed category]] (see at _[[convenient category of topological spaces]]_). As such it canonically obtains the structure of a [[topologically enriched category]], def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory}, with [[hom-spaces]] given by [[mapping spaces]]

$$
  Top_k(X,Y)
  \coloneqq
  Y^X
$$

and with [[composition]] 

$$
  Y^X \times Z^Y
  \longrightarrow
  Z^X
$$

given by the (product$\dashv$ mapping-space)-[[adjunct]] of the [[evaluation morphism]]

$$
  X \times Y^X \times Z^Y
  \overset{(ev, id)}{\longrightarrow}
  Y \times Z^Y
  \overset{ev}{\longrightarrow}
  Z
  \,.
$$

Similarly, [[pointed topological spaces|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_k^{\ast/}$ form a pointed topologically enriched category.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor}
###### Definition

A [[topologically enriched functor]] between two [[topologically enriched categories]] 

$$
  F \;\colon\;  \mathcal{C}  \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}
$$

is a [[Top]]-[[enriched functor]], hence:

1. a [[function]]

   $$
     F_0 \colon Obj(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow Obj(\mathcal{D})
   $$

   of [[objects]];

1. for each $a,b \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a [[continuous function]]

   $$
     F_{a,b} \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(a,b) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}(F_0(a), F_0(b))
   $$

   of [[hom-spaces]]

such that this preserves [[composition]] and [[identity]] morphisms in the evident sense.

A [[homomorphism]] of topologically enriched functors 

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; F \Rightarrow G
$$ 

is a [[Top]]-[[enriched natural transformation]]: for each $c \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ a choice of morphism $\eta_c \in \mathcal{D}(F(c),G(c))$ such that for each pair of objects $c,d \in \mathcal{C}$ the two continuous functions 

$$
  \eta_d \circ F(-) \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(c,d) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}(F(c), G(d))
$$

and

$$
  G(-) \circ \eta_c \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(c,d) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}(F(c), G(d))
$$

agree.

We write $[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}]$ for the resulting category of topologically enriched functors. This itself naturally obtains the structure of [[topologically enriched category]], see at _[[enriched functor category]]_.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #TopologicallyEnrichedFunctorsToTopk}
###### Example

For $\mathcal{C}$ any topologically enriched category, def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory} then a topologically enriched functor

$$
  F \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Top_k
$$

to the archetical topologically enriched category from example \ref{TopkAsATopologicallyEnrichedCategory} may be thought of as a topologically enriched [[copresheaf]], at least if $\mathcal{C}$ is [[small category|small]] (in that its [[class]] of objects is a proper [[set]]).

Hence the category of topologically enriched functors

$$
  [\mathcal{C}, Top_k] 
$$

according to def. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor} may be thought of as the ([[copresheaf|co-]])[[presheaf category]] over $\mathcal{C}$ in the realm of topological enriched categories.

A functor $F \in [\mathcal{C}, Top_k]$ is equivalently 

* a [[compactly generated topological space]] $F_a\in Top_k$ for each object $a \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$;

* a [[continuous function]]

  $$
     F_a \times \mathcal{C}(a,b) \longrightarrow F_b
  $$

  for all pairs of objects $a,b \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$

such that composition is respected, in the evident sense.

For every object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, there is a topologically enriched [[representable functor]], denoted $y(c) or \mathcal{C}(c,-)$ which sends objects to 

$$
  y(c)(d) = \mathcal{C}(c,d) \in Top
$$

and whose action on morphisms is, under the above identification, just the [[composition]] operation in $\mathcal{C}$.

There is a full blown [[Top]]-[[enriched Yoneda lemma]]. The following records a slightly simplified version which is all that is needed here:

+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicallyEnrichedYonedaLemma}
###### Proposition
**(topologically enriched Yoneda-lemma)**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[topologically enriched category]], def. \ref{TopEnrichedCategory}, write $[\mathcal{C}, Top_k]$ for its category of topologically enriched (co-)presheaves, and for $c\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$ write $y(c) = \mathcal{C}(c,-) \in [\mathcal{C}, Top_k]$ for the topologically enriched functor that it represents, all according to example \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctorsToTopk}. Recall also the Top-tensored functors $F \cdot X$ from that example.

For $c\in Obj(\mathcal{C})$, $X \in Top$ and $F \in [\mathcal{C}, Top_k]$, there is a [[natural bijection]] between 

1. morphisms $y(c) \cdot X \longrightarrow F$ in $[\mathcal{C}, Top_k]$;

1. morphisms $X \longrightarrow F(c)$ in [[Top]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a morphism $\eta \colon y(c) \cdot X \longrightarrow F$ consider its component

$$
  \eta_c \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(c,c)\times X \longrightarrow F(c)
$$

and restrict that to the identity morphism $id_c \in \mathcal{C}(c,c)$ in the first argument

$$
  \eta_c(id_c,-) \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow F(c)
  \,.
$$

We claim that just this $\eta_c(id_c,-)$ already uniquely determines all components 

$$
  \eta_d \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(c,d)\times X \longrightarrow F(d)
$$

of $\eta$, for all $d \in Obj(\mathcal{C})$: By definition of the transformation $\eta$ (def. \ref{TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor}), the two functions

$$
   F(-) \circ \eta_c
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(c,d)
  \longrightarrow
  F(d)^{\mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X}
$$

and

$$
  \eta_d  \circ \mathcal{C}(c,-) \times X
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(c,d)
  \longrightarrow
  F(d)^{\mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X}
$$

agree. This means that they may be thought of jointly as a function with values in commuting squares in $Top$ of this form:

$$
  f
  \;\;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    \mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X &\overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow}& F(c)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mathcal{C}(c,f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f)}}
    \\
    \mathcal{C}(c,d) \times X &\underset{\eta_d}{\longrightarrow}& F(d)
  }
$$

For any $f \in \mathcal{C}(c,d)$, consider the restriction of

$$
  \eta_d \circ \mathcal{C}(c,f) \in F(d)^{\mathcal{C}(c,c) \times X}
$$

to $id_c \in \mathcal{C}(c,c)$, hence restricting the above commuting squares to

$$
  f
  \;\;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    \{id_c\} \times X &\overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow}& F(c)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mathcal{C}(c,f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F}(f)}
    \\
    \{f\} \times X &\underset{\eta_d}{\longrightarrow}& F(d)
  }
$$

This shows that $\eta_d$ is fixed to be the function

$$
  \eta_d(f,x) = F(f)\circ \eta_c(id_c,x)
$$

and this is a continuous function since all the operations it is built from are continuous.

Conversely, given a continuous function $\alpha \colon X \longrightarrow F(c)$, define for each $d$ the function

$$
  \eta_d \colon (f,x) \mapsto F(f) \circ \alpha
  \,.
$$

Running the above analysis backwards shows that this determines a transformation $\eta \colon y(c)\times X \to F$.

###### Theorem

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInTheProjectiveModelStructureOnTopEnrichedFunctors} constitute a [[model category]] structure on $[\mathcal{C}, Top]$, called the **[[projective model structure on enriched functors]]** $[\mathcal{C}, Top_{Quillen}]_{proj}$.

This is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]], def. \ref{CofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory}, with set of generating (acyclic) cofibrations the set $I_{Top^{\ast/}}^{\mathcal{C}}$ ($J_{Top^{\ast/}}^{\mathcal{C}}$) from def. \ref{GeneratingCofibrationsForProjectiveStructureOnFunctors}. 

=--

([Piacenza 91, theorem 5.4](#Piacenza91))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Via remark \ref{MorphismsFromTensoredRepresentableToTopologicallyEnrichedFunctor}, the statement essentially reduces objectwise to the proof of theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}:

In particular, the technical lemmas \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}, \ref{JTopRelativeCellComplexesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences} and \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} generalize immediately to the present situation, with the evident small change of wording. 

For instance the fact that a morphism of topologically enriched functors $\eta \colon F \to G$ that has the right lifting property against the elements of $I_{Top}^{\mathcal{C}}$ is a projective weak equivalence, follows by noticing that remark \ref{MorphismsFromTensoredRepresentableToTopologicallyEnrichedFunctor} gives a [[natural bijection]] of commuting diagrams (and their fillers) of the form

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    y(c) \cdot S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& F
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id\cdot \iota_n)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}
    \\ 
    y(c) \cdot D^n &\longrightarrow& G
  }
  \right)
  \;\;\;\leftrightarrow\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& F(c)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta_c}}
     \\
     D^n &\longrightarrow& G(c)
  }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

and hence the statement follows with part A) of the proof of lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations}.

With these three lemmas in hand, the remaining formal part of the proof goes through verbatim as [above](#VerificationOfTopQuillen): repeatedly use the [[small object argument]] and the [[retract argument]] to establish the two weak factorization systems. (While again the structure of a [[category with weak equivalences]] is evident.)

These authors speak about inclusions of [[simplicial sets]].

First consider this for $\mathcal{C} = Top_{Quillen}$ and for the second statement. Using the [[exponential object|exponential law]], one finds that lifting in the left diagram below is equivalent to lifting in the right diagram

$$
  \array{
    D^n &\longrightarrow& \mathcal{C}(B,X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n \times I &\longrightarrow& \mathcal{C}(A,X) \underset{\mathcal{C}(A,Y)}{\times} \mathcal{C}(B,Y)
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    (D^n \times I \times A) \underset{D^n  \times A}{\sqcup} (D^n \times B)
     &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0) \Box i}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    D^n \times I \times B &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the first item of lemma \ref{PushoutProductOfRelativeCWComplexes}, the morphism $(id,\delta_0) \Box i$ is an acyclic cofibration, hence the lift on the right exists by theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}. This shows that $p^{\Box i}$ is a fibration. Similarly for the other cases.

### **P.2)** Simplicial homotopy theory 
 {#SimplicialSets}


The nature of [[objects]] in any [[category]] is not determined by how we present these objects, but by the web of [[morphisms]] relating them ([[structuralism]]). In this respect, the objects of the classical homotopy category [[Ho(Top)]] [above](#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory) turn out to have lost the geometric nature of [[topology]] to retain only a more set-theoretic combinatorial nature. This is more explicitly captured by the concept of _[[simplicial sets]]_ and their _[[simplicial homotopy theory]]_.

**Literature.** ([Goerss-Jardine 99, chapter I](#GoerssJardine99), [Joyal-Tierney 05](#JoyalTierney05)). 

#### Background from combinatorial topology


##### Simplicial sets

Simplicial sets are secretly well familiar already in basic [[algebraic topology]]: they reflect just the abstract structure carried by the [[singular simplicial complexes]] of topological spaces, as in the definition of [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]]. 

Conversely, every simplicial set may be [[geometric realization|geometrically realized]] as a topological space. These two [[adjoint]] operations turn out to exhibit the homotopy theory of simplicial sets as being equivalent ([[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]]) to the homotopy theory of topological spaces.  For some purposes, working in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] is preferable over working with topological homotopy theory.

The sets $(Sing X)_\bullet$ here are closely related by an interlocking system of maps that make them form what is called a _[[simplicial set]]_, and as such the collection of these sets of singular simplices is called the _[[singular simplicial complex]]_ of $X$. We discuss the definition of simplicial sets now and then come back to this below in def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.

Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:

###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]  
  = 
  \left\{

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[hom functor]] of [[Top]]:

###### Remark 

It turns out -- this is the content of the _[[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_ ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)) -- that [[homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$. Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] of $Sing X$ is a model for the same [[homotopy type]] as that of $X$, but with the special property that it is canonically a [[cell complex]] -- a [[CW-complex]]. Better yet, $Sing X$ is itself already good cell complex, namely a [[Kan complex]]. We come to this below.

The the basic invariants of [[simplicial sets]]/[[Kan complexes]] in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] are their [[simplicial homotopy groups]], to which we turn now.
 
Given that a [[Kan complex]] is a special [[simplicial set]] that [[homotopy hypothesis|behaves like]] a combinatorial model for a [[topological space]], the _simplicial homotopy groups_ of a  Kan complex are accordingly the combinatorial analog of the [[homotopy groups]] of [[topological spaces]]: instead of being maps from topological [[spheres]] modulo maps from topological disks, they are maps from the [[boundary of a simplex]] modulo those from the [[simplex]] itself. 

Accordingly, the definition of the discussion of simplicial homotopy groups is essentially literally the same as that of [[homotopy groups]] of topological spaces.  One technical difference is for instance that the definition of the group structure is slightly more non-immediate for simplicial homotopy groups than for topological homotopy groups (see below).

For $x \in X_0$ a vertex and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, then the underlying [[set]]  of the **$n$th [[simplicial homotopy group]]** of $X$ at $x$ -- denoted $\pi_n(X,x)$ -- is, the set of [[equivalence classes]] $[\alpha]$ of morphisms

$$
  \alpha \colon \Delta^n \to X
$$ 
 
from the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ to $X$, such that these take the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary of the simplex]] to $x$, i.e. such that they fit into a [[commuting diagram]] in [[sSet]] of the form

+-- {: .num_defn #ProductOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups}
###### Definition 
  
For $X$ a [[Kan complex]], for $x\in X_0$, for $n \geq 1$ and for  $f,g \colon \Delta[n] \to X$ two representatives of $\pi_n(X,x)$ as in def. \ref{UnderlyingSetsOfSimplicialHomotopyGroups}, consider the following $n$-simplices in $X_n$:

$$
  v_i 
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
      s_0 \circ s_0 \circ \cdots \circ s_0 (x) & for \; 0 \leq i \leq  n-2
      \\
      f & for \; i = n-1
      \\
      g & for \; i = n+1
    }
  \right.
$$

This corresponds to a morphism $\Lambda^{n+1}[n] \to X$ from a [[horn]] of the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] into $X$. By the [[Kan complex]] property of $X$ this morphism has an [[extension]] $\theta$ through the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda^{n+1}[n] & \longrightarrow & X
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta}}
     \\
     \Delta[n+1]
  }
$$

From the [[simplicial identities]] one finds that the boundary of the $n$-simplex arising as the $n$th boundary piece $d_n \theta$ of $\theta$ is constant on $x$

$$
  d_i d_{n} \theta = d_{n-1} d_i \theta = x
$$

So $d_n \theta$ represents an element in $\pi_n(X,x)$ and we define a product operation on $\pi_n(X,x)$ by

$$
  [f]\cdot [g] \coloneqq [d_n \theta]

$Sing(X)$, def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}, is a Kan complex, def. \ref{KanComplexes}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusions ${{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \hookrightarrow \Delta^n_{Top}$ of topological horns into topological simplices are  [[retracts]], in that there are [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n_{Top} \to {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k$ given by "squashing" a topological $n$-simplex onto parts of its boundary, such that

$$
  ({{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \to \Delta^n_{Top} \to
  {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k)
  =
  Id
  \,.
$$

Therefore the map
$[\Delta^n, \Pi(X)] \to [\Lambda^n_k,\Pi(X)]$ is an epimorphism, since it is equal to  to $Top(\Delta^n, X) \to Top(\Lambda^n_k, X)$ which has a right inverse $Top(\Lambda^n_k, X) \to Top(\Delta^n, X)$.

By assumption of the base being connected, the classifying maps for the fibers over any two vertices are connected by a [[zig-zag]] of [[homotopies]], hence by lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} the fibers are connected by [[homotopy equivalences]] and then by prop. \ref{PullbackPreservesMinimalFibration} and lemma \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} they are already isomorphic.

Moreover, for all $n$ the morphisms $\Delta[n] \to \Delta[0] \to \Delta[n]$ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to $\Delta[n] \stackrel{id}{\to} \Delta[n]$ and so applying lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} and prop. \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} once more yields that the fiber over each $\Delta[n]$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\Delta[n]\times F$.

Since homotopy groups are built from maps into $X$ out of [[compact topological spaces]] it is plausible that this works if the topology of $X$ is entirely detected by maps out of compact topological spaces into $X$.

###### Theorem

Let $W$ be the smallest class of morphisms in $sSet$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. The class of monomorphisms that are in $W$ is closed under [[pushout]], [[transfinite composition]], and [[retracts]].
2. $W$ has the [[two-out-of-three]] property in $sSet$ (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) and contains all the [[isomorphisms]].
3. For all natural numbers $n$, the unique morphism $\Delta [n] \to \Delta [0]$ is in $W$.

Then $W$ is the class of weak homotopy equivalences.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

* First, notice that the horn inclusions $\Lambda^0 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ and $\Lambda^1 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ are in $W$.
* Suppose that the horn inclusion $\Lambda^k [m] \hookrightarrow \Delta [m]$ is in $W$ for all $m \lt n$ and all $0 \le k \le m$. Then for $0 \le l \le n$, the horn inclusion $\Lambda^l [n] \hookrightarrow \Delta [n]$ is also in $W$.
* Quillen's [[small object argument]] then implies all the trivial cofibrations are in $W$.
* If $p : X \to Y$ is a trivial Kan fibration, then its right lifting property implies there is a morphism $s : Y \to X$ such that $p \circ s = id_Y$, and the two-out-of-three property implies $s : Y \to X$ is a trivial cofibration. Thus every trivial Kan fibration is also in $W$.
* Every weak homotopy equivalence factors as $p \circ i$ where $p$ is a trivial Kan fibration and $i$ is a trivial cofibration, so every weak homotopy equivalence is indeed in $W$.
* Finally, noting that the class of weak homotopy equivalences satisfies the conditions in the theorem, we deduce that it is the _smallest_ such class.

=--

As a corollary, we deduce that the classical model structure on $sSet$ is the smallest (in terms of weak equivalences) model structure for which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms and the weak equivalences include the (combinatorial) homotopy equivalences.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\pi_0 : sSet \to Set$ be the connected components functor, i.e. the left adjoint of the constant functor $cst : Set \to sSet$. A morphism $f : Z \to W$ in $sSet$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced map
$$\pi_0 K^f : \pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$$
is a bijection for all _Kan complexes_ $K$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One direction is easy: if $K$ is a Kan complex, then axiom SM7 for [[simplicial model categories]] implies  the functor $K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to sSet$ is a right [[Quillen functor]], so Ken Brown's lemma implies it preserves all weak homotopy equivalences; in particular, $\pi_0 K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to Set$ sends weak homotopy equivalences to bijections.

Conversely, when $K$ is a Kan complex, there is a natural bijection between $\pi_0 K^X$ and the hom-set $Ho (sSet) (X, K)$, and thus by the [[Yoneda lemma]], a morphism $f : Z \to W$ such that the induced morphism $\pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$ is a bijection for all Kan complexes $K$ is precisely a morphism that becomes an isomorphism in $Ho (sSet)$, i.e. a weak homotopy equivalence.

### **P.3)** Homotopy fiber sequences
 {#HomotopyFiberSequences}

A key aspect of [[homotopy theory]] is that the [[universal constructions]] of [[category theory]], such as [[limits]] and [[colimits]], receive a refinement whereby their [[universal properties]] hold not just up to [[isomorphism]] but up to ([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalence]]. One speaks of _[[homotopy limits]]_ and _[[homotopy colimits]]_.

We consider this here just for the special case of [[homotopy fibers]] and [[homotopy cofibers]], leading to the phenomenon of [[homotopy fiber sequences]] and their induced [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] which control much of the theory to follow.

Instead of going through the full theory of what this means, we observe that this is plausibly modeled by the following construction, and then we check ([below](#HomotopyFibers)) that this indeed has the relevant abstract homotopy theoretic properties.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory} with $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ its model structure on pointed objects, prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}.  
For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism between cofibrant objects (hence a morphism in $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})_c\hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}), its **reduced [[mapping cone]]** is the object 

$$
  Cone(f)
  \coloneqq
  \ast \underset{X}{\sqcup} Cyl(X) \underset{X}{\sqcup} Y
$$

in the colimiting diagram

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\longrightarrow}& Cyl(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}} & \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone(f) 
  }
  \,,
$$

where $Cyl(X)$ is a [[cylinder object]] for $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.

Dually, for $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism between fibrant objects (hence a morphism in $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast})_f\hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}), its _[[mapping cocone]]_ is the object 

$$
  Path_\ast(f) \coloneqq \ast \underset{Y}{\times} Path(Y)\underset{Y}{\times} Y
$$

in the following limit diagram

$$
  \array{
    Path_\ast(f) &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& X

    \downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}& && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}

###### Remark

If we write homotopies (def. \ref{LeftHomotopyOfSimplicialSets}) as double arrows between morphisms, then then limit diagram in def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone} looks just like the square in the definition of [[fibers]] in def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, except that it is filled by the right homotopy given by the component map denoted $\eta$:

$$
  \array{
    Path_\ast(f) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Dually, the colimiting diagram for the mapping cone turns to look just like the square for the [[cofiber]], except that it is filled with a left homotopy 

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Cone(f)

###### Proposition

The colimit appearing in the definition of the reduced [[mapping cone]] in def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone} is equivalent to three consecutive [[pushouts]]:

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} &(po)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}

    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\longrightarrow}& Cyl(X) &\longrightarrow& Cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow & (po) & \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\longrightarrow& Cone(X) &\longrightarrow& Cone(f) 
  }
  \,.
$$

The two intermediate objects appearing here are called

* the plain **reduced [[cone]]**  $Cone(X) \coloneqq \ast \underset{X}{\sqcup} Cyl(X)$;

* the **reduced [[mapping cylinder]]** $Cyl(f) \coloneqq Cyl(X) \underset{X}{\sqcup} Y$.

Dually, the limit appearing in the definition of the [[mapping cocone]] in def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone} is equivalent to three consecutive [[pullbacks]]:

$$
  \array{
    Path_\ast(f) &\longrightarrow& Path(f) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}

    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_0}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

The two intermediate objects appearing here are called

* the **based path space object** $Path_\ast(Y) \coloneqq \ast \underset{Y}{\prod} Path(Y)$;

* the **mapping path space** or **mapping co-cylinder** $Path(f) \coloneqq X \underset{Y}{\times} Path(X)$.

Let $X \in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ be any [[pointed object]].

1. The [[mapping cone]], def. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder}, of $X \to \ast$ is called the  **[[reduced suspension|reduced]] [[suspension]]** of $X$, denoted 

   $$
     \Sigma X = Cone(X\to\ast)\,.
   $$

   Via prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} this is equivalently the coproduct of two copies of the cone on $X$ over their base:

   $$
     \array{
       && X &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \ast

   This is also equivalently the [[cofiber]], def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects} of $(i_0,i_1)$, hence (example \ref{WedgeSumAsCoproduct}) of the [[wedge sum]] inclusion:

   $$
     X \vee X

     X \sqcup X 
      \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow}

1. The [[mapping cocone]], def. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder}, of $\ast \to X$ is called the **[[loop space object]]** of $X$, denoted

   $$
     \Omega X = Path_\ast(\ast \to X)

</div>

For $\mathcal{C} =$ [[Top]] with $Cyl(X) = X\times I$ the standard cyclinder object, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, then by example \ref{PushoutInTop}, the [[mapping cone]], def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}, of a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. attaching to one end of that cylinder the space $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Accordingly the [[suspension]] of a topological space is the result of shrinking both ends of the cylinder on the object two the point. This is homeomoprhic to attaching two copies of the cone on the space at the base of the cone.

###### Remark

The _formula_ for the [[mapping cone]] in prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} (as opposed to that of the mapping co-cone) does not require the presence of the basepoint: for $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ (as opposed to in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$) we may still define

$$
  Cone'(f) \coloneqq Y \underset{X}{\sqcup} Cone'(X)

$$

where the prime denotes the _unreduced cone_, formed from a cylinder object in $\mathcal{C}$.

+-- {: .num_prop #UnreducedMappingConeAsReducedConeOfBasedPointAdjoined}
###### Proposition

For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism in [[Top]], then its unreduced mapping cone, remark \ref{UnreducedCone}, with respect to the standard cylinder object $X \times I$ def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, is isomorphic to the reduced mapping cone, def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}, of the morphism $f_+ \colon X_+ \to Y_+$ (with a basepoint adjoined, def. \ref{BasePointAdjoined}) with respect to the standard [[reduced cylinder]] (example \ref{StandardReducedCyclinderInTop}):

$$
  Cone'(f) \simeq Cone(f_+)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects} and example \ref{WedgeAndSmashOfBasePointAdjoinedTopologicalSpaces}, $Cone(f_+)$ is given by the colimit in $Top$ over the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup \ast &\overset{(f,id)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X \sqcup\ast &\longrightarrow& (X \times I) \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone(f_+)  
  }
  \,.
$$

We may factor the vertical maps to give

$$
  \array{
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup \ast &\overset{(f,id)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X \sqcup\ast &\longrightarrow& (X \times I) \sqcup \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast \sqcup \ast &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone'(f)_+
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& Cone'(f)  
  }
  \,.
$$



This way the top part of the diagram (using the [[pasting law]] to compute the colimit in two stages) is manifestly a cocone under the result of applying $(-)_+$ to the diagram for the unreduced cone. Since $(-)_+$ is itself given by a colimit, it preserves colimits, and hence gives the partial colimit $Cone'(f)_+$ as shown. The remaining pushout then contracts the remaining copy of the point away.

=--


Example \ref{MappingConesInTopologicalSpaces} makes it clear that every [[cycle]] $S^n \to Y$ in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be _continuously_ translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it shrinks away to the point. This means that every [[homotopy group]] of $Y$, def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}, in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping cone **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it intuitively clear how $Cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[cokernel]] of $f$. We now discuss this formally.

###### Lemma
**([[factorization lemma]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}_c$ be a [[category of cofibrant objects]],  def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}. Then for every morphism $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ the [[mapping cylinder]]-construction in def. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} provides a cofibration resolution of $f$, in that 

1. the composite morphism $X \overset{i_0}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \overset{(i_1)_\ast f}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(f)$ is a cofibration;

1. $f$ factors through this morphism by a weak equivalence.

   $$
     f 
       \;\colon\;
     X 
        \underoverset{\in Fib}{(i_1)_\ast f\circ i_0}{\longrightarrow} 
     Cyl(f)
       \underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow} 
     Y
     \,,
   $$

Dually:

Let $\mathcal{C}_f$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]],  def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}. Then for every morphism $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ the [[mapping cocylinder]]-construction in def. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} provides a fibration resolution of $f$, in that 

1. the composite morphism $Path(f) \overset{p_1^\ast f}{\longrightarrow} Path(Y) \overset{p_0}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is a fibration;

1. $f$ factors through this morphism by a weak equivalence.

   $$
     f 
       \;\colon\;
     X 
       \underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow} 
     Path(f) 
        \underoverset{\in Fib}{p_0 \circ p_1^\ast f}{\longrightarrow} 
     Y
     \,,
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the second case. The first case is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

So consider the [[mapping cocylinder]]-construction from prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder}

$$
  \array{
     Path(f) &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_1^\ast f}}\downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     Path(Y) &\stackrel{p_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_0}}
     \\
     Y
  }
  \,.
$$


To see that the vertical composite is indeed a fibration, notice that, by the [[pasting law]], the above pullback diagram may be decomposed as a [[pasting]] of two pullback diagram as follows

$$
  \array{
    Path(f)
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
     X \times Y 
     &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}& 
     X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(f, Id)}} && \downarrow^\mathrlap{f}
     \\
     Y^I &\stackrel{(p_1,p_0) }{\longrightarrow}&
     Y \times Y &\stackrel{p_1}{\longrightarrow}&
     Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_0}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
     \\
     Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Both squares are pullback squares. Since pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations by prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfInjectiveAndProjectiveMorphisms}, the morphism $Path(f) \to X \times Y$ is a fibration.
Similarly, since $X$ is fibrant, also the [[projection]] map $X \times Y \to Y$ is a fibration (being the pullback of $X \to \ast$ along $Y \to \ast$).

Since the vertical composite is thereby exhibited as the composite of two fibrations

$$
   Path(f) \to X \times Y
    \stackrel{p_2 \circ (f ,Id)}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,,
$$

it is itself a fibration.


Next, by lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation}, both projections $p_i \colon Path(X)\to X$ are weak equivalences,  By the [[universal property]] of  [[pullbacks]], this induces a right inverse of $Path(f) \to X$ fitting into this [[pasting]] diagram

$$
  \array{
     id_X \colon & X &\underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}
       & Path(f) &
     \longrightarrow& X
     \\
     & {}^{\mathrlap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     id_Y\colon& Y &\underset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& Y^I &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}& Y
     \\
     & & {}_{\mathllap{Id}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_0}} 
     \\
     & && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This establishes the claim.

#### Categories of fibrant objects

[Below](#HomotopyFibers) we discuss the homotopy-theoretic properties of the [[mapping cone]]- and [[mapping cocone]]-constructions from [above](#MappingCones). Before we do so, we here establish a collection of general facts that hold in [[categories of fibrant objects]] and dually in [[categories of cofibrant objects]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}.

###### Lemma

Let $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism in a [[category of fibrant objects]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}. Then given any choice of [[path space objects]] $Path(X)$ and $Path(Y)$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, there is a replacement of $Path(X)$ by a path space object $\widetilde{Path(X)}$ along an acylic fibration, such that $\widetilde{Path(X)}$ has a morphism $\phi$ to $Path(Y)$ which is compatible with the structure maps, in that the following diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    && X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y

    &\swarrow& \downarrow && \downarrow

    Path(X) &\underset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longleftarrow}& \widetilde{Path(X)} &\overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& Path(Y)

    \\
    && X \times X &\overset{(f,f)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \times Y
  }
  \,.
$$

([Brown 73, section 2, lemma 2](#Brown73))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y &\longrightarrow& Path(Y)
    \\
    \downarrow &&  && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0^Y, p_1^Y)}}
    \\
    Path(X) &\overset{(p^X_0,p^X_1)}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
    &\overset{(f,f)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \times Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Then consider its factorization  through the [[pullback]] of the right morphism along the bottom morphism, 

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& (f \circ p_0^X, f\circ p_1^X)^\ast Path(Y) &\longrightarrow& Path(Y)
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0^Y, p_1^Y)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    && Path(X) &\overset{(f \circ p_0^X, f\circ p_1^X)}{\longrightarrow}& Y \times Y
  }
  \,.
$$


Finally use the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} to factor the morphism $X \to (f \circ p_0^X, f\circ p_1^X)^\ast Path(Y)$ through a weak equivalence followed by a fibration, the object this factors through serves as the desired path space resolution

$$
  \array{

    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0^Y, p_1^Y)}}

+-- {: .num_proof}
###### Proof

For $f \in F$ the statement follows from 
the fact that in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    B' \times_B A_1 &\longrightarrow& A_1
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{u^* f \in F}} 
    && \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \in F}}
    \\
    B' \times_B A_2 &\longrightarrow& A_2
    \\
    \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in F}} && \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in F}}
    \\
    B' &\stackrel{u}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
$$

all squares (the two inner ones as well as the
outer one) are [[pullback]] squares,
since pullback squares compose under pasting.

The same reasoning applies for $f \in W \cap Fib$.

To apply this reasoning  to the case where $f \in W$, we first
make use of the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} 
to decompose $f$ as a right inverse to an acyclic fibration followed by an
acyclic fibration. 

$$
  f \;\colon\; 
  A_1 \stackrel{\in W}{\longrightarrow} 
    Path(f)
  \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\longrightarrow} A_2
  \,.
$$


Using the above this reduces the proof to showing that 
the pullback of the top horizontal morphism of

$$
 \array{
  A_1 &&\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}&& Path(f)
  \\
  & {}_{\in Fib}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in Fib}
  \\
  && B
 }
$$

along $u$ is a weak equivalence. (Here the fibration on the right is the composite  of the fibration $Path(f) \to A_2$ with $A_2 \to B$).  For that 
consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    B' \times_B A_1  &\longrightarrow& A_1
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B' \times_B Path(f) 
    &\longrightarrow& 
    Path(f)
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}} 
    && 
      \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    B' \times_B A_1 &\to& A_1
    \\
    \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}} && \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\     
    B' &\longrightarrow& B
  }
$$

where again all squares are pullback squares.
The top two vertical composite morphisms are identities. Hence by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) the morphism $B' \times_B E_1 \to B' \times_B Path(f)$ is a weak equivalence.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Let 
$u \colon B' \to B$ be a weak equivalence and
$ p \colon E \to B$ be a fibration. We want to show that the
left vertical morphism in the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    E \times_B B' &\to& B'
    \\
    \;\;\;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Rightarrow \in W} } 
    && \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    \\
    E &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a fibration. 

First of all, using the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma}
we may always factor $B' \to B$ as
$B ' \stackrel{\in W}{\to} Path(u) 
 \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} B$ with the first morphism a weak equivalence that is a right inverse to an acyclic fibration and the right one an acyclic fibration.

Then the pullback diagram in question may be decomposed
into two consecutive pullback diagrams

$$
  \array{
    E \times_B B' &\to& B'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Q &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& Path(u)
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap F}} 
    && \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap F}}
    \\
    E &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the morphisms are indicated as fibrations and
acyclic fibrations using the stability of these
under arbitrary pullback.

This means that the proof reduces to proving that weak equivalences
$u : B' \stackrel{\in W}{\to} B$ 
that are right inverse to some acyclic fibration
$v : B \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} B'$
map to a weak equivalence under pullback along a fibration.

Given such $u$ with right inverse $v$, consider the pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    E
    \\
    & {}_{\in W}\searrow^{p \times Id} && \searrow^{Id}
    \\
    &&
       E_1 \coloneqq B \times_{B'} E 
    &
       \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} 
    & 
       E
    \\
    &&\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in F}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p \in F}}
    \\
    &&&& B 
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{v \in F \cap W}}
    \\
    &&B &\stackrel{v \in W \cap F}{\to}& B'
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that the indicated universal morphism  $p \times Id \colon E \stackrel{\in W}{\to} E_1$  into the pullback is a weak equivalence by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

The previous lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences} says that weak equivalences between fibrations over $B$ are themselves preserved by base extension along $u \colon B' \to B$. In total this yields the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    u^* E = B' \times_B E
    &\longrightarrow &E
    \\
    &{}_{\in W}\searrow^{u^*(p \times Id)}
    && {}_{\in W}\searrow^{p \times Id} && \searrow^{Id}
    \\
    &&
    u^* E_1
    &\longrightarrow&
       E_1     &
       \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} 
    & 
       E
    \\
    &&\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in F}}&&\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in F}} 
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p \in F}}
    \\
    &&&&&& B 
    \\
    &&\downarrow&&\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{v \in F \cap W}}
    \\
    &&
    B'
    &\stackrel{u}{\to}&
    B &\stackrel{v \in W \cap F}{\to}& B'
  }
$$

so that with $p \times Id  : E \to E_1$ a weak equivalence also $u^* (p \times Id)$ is a weak equivalence, as indicated.

Notice that $u^* E = B' \times_B E \to E$ is the morphism that we want to show is a weak equivalence. By 2-out-of-3 for that it is now sufficient to show that $u^* E_1  \to E_1$ is a weak equivalence.

That finally follows now since, by assumption, the total bottom horizontal morphism is the identity. Hence so is the top horizontal morphism. Hence $u^\ast E_1  \to E_1$ is right inverse to a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence.

###### Lemma

Let $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})_f$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects} in a [[slice model structure|model structure on pointed objects]] (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}). Given any [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}^{}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    X'_1 &\overset{t}{\longrightarrow}& X_1 &\stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}}& X_2

    \\
    && B &\overset{u}{\longrightarrow}& C
  }
$$

(meaning: both squares commute and $t$ equalizes $f$ with $g$) then the [[localization]] functor $\gamma \colon (\mathcal{C}^{\ast})_f \to Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ (def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, cor \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfSubcategoriesOfModelCategoriesOnGoodObjects}) takes the morphisms induced by $f$ and $g$ on [[fibers]] (def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}) $fib(p_1) \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} fib(p_2)$ to the same morphism, in the homotopy category.

=--

([Brown 73, section 4, lemma 4](#Brown73))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the pullback of $p_2$ along $u$: this forms the same kind of diagram but with the bottom morphism an identity. Hence it is sufficient to consider this special case.

Let then $X\overset{s}{\to}Path(X_2)\overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\to} X_2\times X_2$ be a [[path space object]] for $X_2$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} and consider the following commuting square

$$
  \array{
    X'_1 &\overset{s f t}{\longrightarrow}& Path(X_2)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{t}}_{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0,p_1)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    X_1 &\overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X_2\underset{B}{\times} X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

By factoring this through the pullback $(f,g)^\ast(p_0,p_1)$ and then applying the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} this may be replaced by a commuting square like so:

$$
  \array{
    X''_1 &\overset{s f t}{\longrightarrow}& Path(X_2)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{t}}_{\mathllap{\in W\cap Fib}} \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_0,p_1)}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    X_1 &\overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X_2\underset{B}{\times} X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that all objects here are equipped with compatible morphisms to $B$, so that this may be regarded as a commuting square in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$, def. \ref{SliceCategory}.
As such, this diagram exhibits that under [[localization]] $\gamma_B \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}_{/B} \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C}_B)$ (def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}) in the [[slice model structure]] (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}) we have

$$
  \gamma_B(f) = \gamma_B(g)
  \,.
$$

The result then follows by observing that we have a commuting square of [[functors]]

$$
  \array{
     (\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B})_f &\overset{fib}{\longrightarrow}& \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_B}} &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma}}
     \\
     Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_{/B}) &\longrightarrow& Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  }
  \,,
$$

because, by lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences}, the top and right composite sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms, and hence the bottom filler exists by theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}. This implies the claim.

#### Homotopy fibers

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} with prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} says that the [[mapping cocone]] of a morphism $f$, def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}, is equivalently the plain [[fiber]], def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, of a fibrant resolution $\tilde f$ of $f$:

$$
  \array{
    Path_\ast(f) &\longrightarrow& \tilde X
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

The following lemma \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} says that, up to equivalence, this situation now is independent of the specific fibration resolution $\tilde f$ provided by the [[factorization lemma]] (hence by the prescription for the [[mapping cocone]]), but only depends on it being _some_ fibration resolution. 


+-- {: .num_lemma #FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences}
###### Lemma

In the [[category of fibrant objects]] $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})_f$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}, of a [[slice model structure|model structure on pointed objects]] (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}) consider a morphism of [[fiber]]-diagrams, hence a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    fib(f_1) &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    fib(f_2) &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2
  }
  \,.
$$

If the two vertical morphisms on the right are weak equivalences, then so is the vertical morphism on the left

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Factor the diagram in question

$$
  \array{
    fib(f_1) &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    fib(f_2) &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2
  }
$$

through the pullback of the bottom horizontal line:

$$
  \array{
    fib(f_1) &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    fib(\phi) &\longrightarrow& f^\ast X_2 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in W}}    
    \\
    fib(f_2) &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2
  }
$$

Here $f^\ast X_2 \to X_2$ is a weak equivalence by lemma \ref{InCfPullbackAlongFibrationPreservesWeakEquivalences} and with this $X_1 \to f^\ast X_2$ is a weak equivalence by assumption and [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).

Moreover, this diagram exhibits $fib(f_1)\to fib(\phi)$ as the base change (along $\ast \to Y_2$) of $X_1 \to f^\ast X_2$. Therefore the claim now follows with lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences}.

Hence we say:

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]] and $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ its model category of [[pointed objects]], prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}. For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ any morphism in its [[category of fibrant objects]] $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})_f$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}, then its **[[homotopy fiber]]**

is the morphism in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$, def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, which is represented by the [[fiber]], def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, of any fibration resolution of $f$.

Dually:

For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ any morphism in its [[category of cofibrant objects]] $(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})_c$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}, then its **[[homotopy cofiber]]**

+-- {: .num_example #FibersOfSerreFibrations}
###### Example
**(fibers of Serre fibrations)**

In showing that [[Serre fibrations]] are abstract fibrations in the sense of [[model category]] theory, theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure} implies that the [[fiber]] $F$ (def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}) of a [[Serre fibration]], def. \ref{SerreFibration} 

$$
  \array{
    F &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

over any point is actually a [[homotopy fiber]] in the sense of def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}. With lemma \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} this implies that the [[weak homotopy type]] of the fiber only depends on the Serre fibration up to weak homotopy equivalence in that if $p' \colon X' \to B'$ is another Serre fibration fitting into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}& X'    
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p'}}
    \\
    B &\overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow}& B'
  }
$$

then $F \overset{\in W_{cl}}{\longrightarrow} F'$. 

In particular this gives that the [[weak homotopy type]] of the fiber of a Serre fibration does not change as the basepoint is moved in the same connected component. (Pull back along any path $I \to B$ and use that $I \stackrel{\in W_{cl}}{\to} \ast$).

Or if $p \colon X\to B$ is already the restriction of a Serre fibration over a CW-complex to one cell $B = D^n$, then choosing $B' = \ast$ shows that the restriction of the original Serre fibration to that cell is weakly homotopy equivalent to $D^n \times F$. These arguments are used when deriving the [[Serre spectral sequence]] for $p$ ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#AHSSExistence)).

+-- {: .num_example #StandardTopologicalMappingConeIsHomotopyCofiber}
###### Example

For every [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between [[CW-complexes]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, then the standard topological mapping cone is the attaching space (example \ref{PushoutInTop}) 

$$
  Y \cup_f Cone(X) \;\; \in Top
$$

of $Y$ with the standard cone $Cone(X)$ given collapsing one end of the standard topological cyclinder $X \times I$ (def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}) as shown in example \ref{MappingConesInTopologicalSpaces}. 

Equipped with the canonical continuous function

$$
  Y \longrightarrow Y \cup_f Cone(X)
$$

this represents the [[homotopy cofiber]], def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}, of $f$ with respect to the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] $\mathcal{C}= Top_{Quillen}$ from theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{StandardContractionOfStandardInterval}, for $X$ a [[CW-complex]] then the standard topological cylinder object $X\times I$ is indeed a  cyclinder object in $Top_{Quillen}$. Therefore by prop. \ref{ConeAndMappingCylinder} and the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma}, the mapping cone construction indeed produces first a cofibrant replacement of $f$ and then the ordinary cofiber of that, hence a model for the homotopy cofiber.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #FiberOfFibrationWeaklyEquivalentToFiberOfItsCocylinder}
###### Example

Suppose a morphism $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ already happens to be a fibration between fibrant objects. The [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} replaces it by a fibration out of the [[mapping cocylinder]] $Path(f)$, but such that the comparison morphism is a weak equivalence: 

$$
  \array{
    fib(f) &\longrightarrow& X &\underoverset{\in Fib}{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
    \\
    fib(\tilde f) &\longrightarrow& Path(f) &\underoverset{\in Fib}{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence by lemma \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} in this case the ordinary fiber of $f$ is weakly equivalent to the [[mapping cocone]], def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone}.

We may now state the abstract version of the statement of prop. \ref{SerreFibrationGivesExactSequenceOfHomotopyGroups}:

+-- {: .num_prop #ExactSequenceOfHomotopyFiberAtOneStage}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. For $f \colon X \to Y$ any morphism of [[pointed objects]], and for $A$ a [[pointed object]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, then the sequence

$$
  [A,hofib(f)]_\ast \overset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow} [A,X]_\ast \overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow} [A,Y]_{\ast}
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]] as a sequence of [[pointed sets]]. 

(Where the sequence here is the image of the [[homotopy fiber]] sequence of def. \ref{HomotopyFiber} under the hom-functor $[A,-]_\ast \;\colon\; Ho(\mathcal{C}^{/\ast}) \longrightarrow Set^{\ast/}$ from example \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfPointedModelStructureIsEnrichedInPointedSets}.)


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may choose representatives such that $A$ is cofibrant, and $f$ is a fibration. Then we are faced with an ordinary pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$ 

and the hom-classes are represented by genuine morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. From this it follows immediately that $ker(p_\ast)$ includes $im(i_\ast)$. Hence it remains to show that every element in $ker(p_\ast)$ indeed comes from $im(i_\ast)$.

But an element in $ker(p_\ast)$ is represented by a morphism $\alpha \colon A \to X$ such that there is a left homotopy as in the following diagram

$$
  \array{
     && A &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     && {}^{\mathllap{i_0}}\downarrow &{}^{\tilde \eta}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     A &\overset{i_1}{\longrightarrow} & Cyl(A) &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
     \\
     \ast && \longrightarrow && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now by lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation} the square here has a lift $\tilde \eta$, as shown. This means that $i_1 \circ\tilde \eta$ is left homotopic to $\alpha$. But by the universal property of the fiber, $i_1 \circ \tilde \eta$ factors through $i \colon hofib(f) \to X$.

=--

With prop. \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} it also follows notably that the loop space construction becomes well-defined on the homotopy category:

###### Remark

Given an object $X \in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_f$, and picking any [[path space object]] $Path(X)$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory} with induced [[loop space object]] $\Omega X$, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, write $Path(X)_2$ for the path space object given by the fiber square of $Path(X)$ via example \ref{ComposedPathSpaceObjects}. From the pullback diagram there, the fiber inclusion $\Omega X \to Path(X)$ induces a morphism

$$
  \Omega X \times \Omega X \longrightarrow (\Omega X)_2

+-- {: .num_prop #LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}. Then the construction of forming [[loop space objects]] $X\mapsto \Omega X$, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject} (which on $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ depends on a choice of [[path space objects]], def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}) becomes unique up to isomorphism in the [[homotopy category of a model category]] (def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}) of the [[slice model structure|model structure on pointed objects]] (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}) and extends to a [[functor]]:

$$
  \Omega 
    \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

Dually, the [[reduced suspension]] operation, def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, which on $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ depends on a choice of [[cylinder object]], becomes a functor on the homotopy category

$$
  \Sigma
   \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the pairing operation induced on the objects in the image of this functor via remark \ref{ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject} (concatenation of loops) gives the objects in the image of $\Omega$ [[group object]] structure, and makes this functor lift as

$$
  \Omega 
    \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
    \longrightarrow
  Grp(Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}))
  \,.
$$

=--

([Brown 73, section 4, theorem 3](#Brown73))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Given an object $X \in \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ and given two choices of path space objects $Path(X)$ and $\widetilde{Path(X)}$, we need to produce an isomorphism in $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ between $\Omega X$ and $\tilde \Omega X$.

To that end, first lemma \ref{ReplacementOfPathObjects} implies that any two choices of path space objects are connected via a third path space by a [[span]] of morphisms compatible with the structure maps. By [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}) every morphisms of path space objects compatible with the inclusion of the base object is a weak equivalence. With this lemma \ref{BaseChangePreservesFibrationsAndWeakEquivalences} implies that these morphisms induce weak equivalences on the corresponding loop space objects. This shows that all choices of loop space objects become isomorphic in the homotopy category.

Moreover, all the isomorphisms produced this way are actually equal: this follows from lemma \ref{UniquenessOfFibersOfQualizedMorphismsInHoC} applied to

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}& Path(X) &\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}& \widetilde{Path(X)}
     \\
     && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     && X\times X &\overset{id}{\longrightarrow}&  X \times X
  }
  \,.
$$

This way we obtain a functor

$$
  \Omega \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}^{\ast/}_f \longrightarrow Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

By lemma \ref{FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences} (and using that Cartesian product preserves weak equivalences) this functor sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms. Therefore the functor on homotopy categories now follows with theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}.

It is immediate to see that the operation of loop concatenation from remark \ref{ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject} gives the objects $\Omega X \in Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ the structure of [[monoids]]. It is now sufficient to see that these are in fact groups.


..
We claim that the inverse-assigning operation is given by the left map in the following pasting composite 

$$
  \array{
    \Omega' X &\longrightarrow& Path'(X) &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{swap}}
    \\
    \Omega X &\longrightarrow& Path(X) &\overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
  }

(where $Path'(X)$, thus defined, is the path space object obtained from $Path(X)$ by "reversing the notion of source and target of a path").

To see that this is indeed an inverse, it is sufficient (...) to see that the two morphisms 

$$ 
  \Omega X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} (\Omega X)_2
$$

induced from 

$$
  \array{
  Path(X) 
\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{(s\circ p_0,s \circ p_0)}{\longrightarrow}}
  Path(X) \times_X Path'(X)
 }
$$

coincide in the homotopy category. This follows with lemma \ref{UniquenessOfFibersOfQualizedMorphismsInHoC} applied to the following commuting diagram:

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& Path(X) &\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{(s\circ p_0,s \circ p_0)}{\longrightarrow}}& Path(X)\times_X Path'(X)
    \\

#### Long sequences
 {#LongSequences}

The ordinary [[fiber]], def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, of a morphism has the property that taking it _twice_ is always trivial:

$$
   \ast \simeq fib(fib(f)) \longrightarrow fib(f) \longrightarrow X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \,.
$$

This is crucially different for the [[homotopy fiber]], def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}. Here we discuss how this comes about and what the consequences are.

+-- {: .num_prop #HomotopyFiberOfHomotopyFiberIsLooping}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}_f$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects} and $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism in its [[category of pointed objects]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}. Then the [[homotopy fiber]] of its [[homotopy fiber]], def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}, is isomorphic (in $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$) to the [[loop space object]] $\Omega Y$ of $Y$ (def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}, prop. \ref{LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}):

$$
  hofib(hofib(X \overset{f}{\to}Y)) \simeq \Omega Y
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume without restriction that $f \colon X \to Y$ is already a fibration between fibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ (otherwise replace and rename). Then its homotopy fiber is its ordinary fiber, sitting in a pullback square 

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

In order to compute $hofib(hofib(f))$, i.e. $hofib(i)$, we need to replace the fiber inclusion $i$ by a fibration. Using the [[factorization lemma]] \ref{FactorizationLemma} for this purpose yields, after a choice of [[path space object]] $Path(X)$ (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}), a replacement of the form

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}& F \times_X Path(X)
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{i}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde i}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}} 
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence $hofib(i)$ is the ordinary fiber of this map:

$$
  hofib(hofib(f)) \simeq  F \times_X Path(X) \times_X \ast \;\;\;\; \in Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

Notice that 

$$
  F \times_X Path(X)  \times_X \simeq \ast \times_Y Path(X)
$$

because of the [[pasting law]]:

$$
  \array{
     F \times_X Path(X) &\longrightarrow& Path(X)
     \\
     \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
     \\
     F &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now we claim that there is a choice of path space objects $Path(X)$ and $Path(Y)$ such that this model for the homotopy fiber (as an object in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$) sits in a [[pullback]] diagram of the following form:

$$
  \array{
    \ast \times_Y Path(X) \times_X \ast &\longrightarrow& Path(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow\mathrlap{\in W \cap F}
    \\
    \Omega Y &\longrightarrow& Path(Y)\times_Y X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow&  Y \times X
  }
  \,.
$$

By the pullback stability of acyclic fibrations, this will prove the claim.

To construct this ([Quillen 67, page 3.1](#Quillen67)): Let $Path(Y)$ be any path space object for $Y$ and let $Path(X)$ be given by the following factorization:

$$
  (id_X, s^Y \circ f, id_X)
  \;\colon\;
  X
  \overset{\in W}{\to}
  Path(X)
  \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times_Y Path(Y) \times_Y X
$$ 

and regarded as a path space object of $X$ by further comoposing with $(pr_1,pr_3)\colon X \times_Y Path(Y) \times_Y X \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow} X \times X$. By inspection (...), this has the required properties.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is a conceptual way to understand prop. \ref{HomotopyFiberOfHomotopyFiberIsLooping} as follows: 
If we draw double arrows to indicate [[homotopies]], then a [[homotopy fiber]] (def. \ref{HomotopyFiber}) is depicted by the following filled square:

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

just like the ordinary [[fiber]] (def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}) is given by a plain square

$$
  \array{
    fib(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

One may show that just like the fiber is the _universal_ solution to making such a commuting square (a [[pullback]] [[limit|limit cone]] def. \ref{LimitsAndColimits}), so the homotopy fiber is the universal solution up to homotopy to make such a commuting square up to homotopy -- a [[homotopy pullback]] [[homotopy limit|homotopy limit cone]].

Now just like ordinary [[pullbacks]] satisfy the [[pasting law]] saying that attaching two pullback squares gives a pullback rectangle, the analogue is true for homotopy pullbacks. This implies that if take the homotopy fiber of a homotopy fiber, thereby producing this double homotopy pullback square

$$
  \array{
    hofib(g) &\longrightarrow& hofib(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

then the total outer rectangle here is itself a homotopy pullback. But the outer rectangle exhibits the homotopy fiber of the point inclusion, which, via def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject} and lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}, is the [[loop space object]]:

$$
  \array{
    \Omega Y &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a model category and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be morphism in the pointed homotopy category $Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})$ (prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSliceCategory}). Then:

1. There is a long sequence to the left in $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ of the form

###### Remark

In ([Quillen 67, I.3, prop. 3, prop. 4](#Quillen67)) more is shown than stated in prop. \ref{LongFiberSequence}: there the [[connecting homomorphism]] $\Omega  Y \to hofib(f)$ is not just shown to exist, but is described in detail via an [[action]] of $\Omega Y$ on $hofib(f)$ in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ in . For all applications that follow, however, it is sufficient to know that such a morphism exists at all, hence that $\Omega Y \simeq hofib(hofib(f))$.

+-- {: .num_example #LongExactSequeceOfHomotopyGroups}
###### Example

Let $\mathcal{C} = Top_{Quillen}$ be the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] from theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}. Then using the  standard topological path space objects $X^I$ from def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} as the abstract path space objects in def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}, via prop. \ref{TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}, or rather the pointed version $X^{I_+}$ from example \ref{PointedMappingSpace}, gives that

$$
  [\ast, \Omega^n X] \simeq \pi_n(X)
$$

is the $n$th [[homotopy group]], def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}, of $X$ at its basepoint.

Hence using $A = \ast$ in the first item of prop. \ref{LongFiberSequence}, the [[long exact sequence]] this gives is of the form

$$
   \cdots
  \to
  \pi_3(X)

$$


This is called the **[[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]]** induced by $f$. 

As we pass to [[stable homotopy theory]] (in [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1|Part 1)]]), these sequences become long not just to the left, but also to the right. Given then a [[tower of fibrations]], then there is an induced sequence of such long exact sequences of homotopy groups, which organizes into an _[[exact couple]]_. For more on this see at _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- I|Interlude) Spectral sequences]]_ [this remark](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum).

Let again $\mathcal{C} = Top_{Quillen}$ be the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] from theorem \ref{TopQuillenModelStructure}, as in example \ref{LongExactSequeceOfHomotopyGroups}. For $E \in Top^{\ast/}$ any [[pointed topological space]] and $i \colon A \hookrightarrow X$ an inclusion of pointed topological spaces, the exactness of the sequence in the second item of prop. \ref{LongFiberSequence}

$$
  \cdots \to [hocofib(i,)E] \longrightarrow [X,E]_\ast \longrightarrow [A,E]_\ast \to \cdots

gives that the functor

$$
  [-,E]_\ast 
  \;\colon\;

$$

behaves like one degree in an [additive](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#WedgeAxiom) [[reduced cohomology theory]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#ReducedGeneralizedCohomology)). The [[Brown representability theorem]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#BrownRepresentabilityTraditional)) implies that all additive reduced cohomology theories are degreewise representable this way ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#AdditiveReducedCohomologyTheoryRepresentedByOmegaSpectrum)).

### The $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-adjunction

We conclude this discussion of classical homotopy theory with the key statement that leads over to [[stable homotopy theory]] in _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1]]_: the suspension and looping adjunction on the classical pointed homotopy category.


Consider the general [[loop space object]] and [[reduced suspension]] functors from prop. \ref{LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory} specialized to the case of the model category $\mathcal{C} = Top_{Quillen}$. In fact prop. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopAreAdjointOnHomotopyCategory} below holds generally for every model category ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)), but using the above properties of the topological interval $I$ we get a more conceptual proof.

+-- {: .num_prop #ReducedSuspensionBySmashProductWithCircle}
###### Proposition

In [[pointed topological spaces]] $Top^{\ast/}$, 

* the [[reduced suspension]] objects (def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}) for [[cylinder object]] beng the standard [[reduced cylinder]] $(-)\wedge (I_+)$ of example \ref{StandardReducedCyclinderInTop} are isomorphic to the [[smash product]] (def. \ref{SmashProductOfPointedObjects}) with the [[1-sphere]] 

  $$
    \Sigma X \simeq X \wedge S^1
    \,,
  $$

Dually:

* the [[loop space objects]] (def. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopSpaceObject}) induced from the standard pointed path space object $(-)^{I_+}$  are isomorphic to the [[pointed mapping space]] (example \ref{PointedMappingSpace})  with the [[1-sphere]]

  $$
    \Omega X \simeq [S^1, X]_\ast
    \,.
  $$

Moreover, by the [[exponential object]]-property of the pointed [[mapping space]] (example \ref{PointedMappingSpace}) these form [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  ((-)\wedge S^1 \dashv [S^1,-]_\ast)

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By immediate inspection. For instance the fiber of $X^{I_+} \longrightarrow X\times X$ is clearly the subspace of the unpointed mapping space $X^I$ on elements that take the endpoints of $I$ to the basepoint of $X$.

The adjunction follows from general principles:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     Hom_{Top^{\ast/}}(X, Y^{S^1})
     & =
     Hom_{Top^{\ast/}}(X, fib(Y^{I_+} \to Y \times Y))
     \\

     fib( Hom_{Top^{\ast/}}( X, Y^{I_+}) \to Hom_{Top_{CW}^{\ast/}}(X, Y \times Y) )
     \\
     & \simeq
     fib( Hom_{Top^{\ast/}}( X \wedge I_+, Y ) \to Hom_{Top_{CW}^{\ast/}}(X\vee X, Y) )
     \\
     & \simeq
     Hom_{Top^{\ast/}}( cofib( X \vee X \to X \wedge I_+), Y )     
     \\
     & \simeq

###### Proposition

The [[loop space]] functor $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspension]] functor $\Sigma$ (prop. \ref{LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}) on the [[classical pointed homotopy category]] (def. \ref{ClassicalModelStructureOnPointedTopologicalSpaces}) are [[adjoint functors]], with $\Sigma$ [[left adjoint]] and $\Omega$ [[right adjoint]]:

$$
  (\Sigma \dashv \Omega)
  \;\colon\;
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}^{\ast/})
   \stackrel{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}
  Ho(Top_{Quillen}^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By the statement of their existence (prop. \ref{LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory}) we may represent $\Sigma$ and $\Omega$ by any choice of [[cylinder objects]] and [[path space objects]] (def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}). Since we may restrict to CW-complexes, the standard topological cylinder $(-)\times I$ is a cylinder object (prop. \ref{TopologicalCylinderOnCWComplexIsGoodCylinderObject}) and, generally, the standard topological path space $(-)^I$ is a path space object (prop. \ref{TopologicalPathSpaceIsGoodPathSpaceObject}).

Now the adjunction of prop. \ref{ReducedSuspensionBySmashProductWithCircle} gives an adjunction

$$
  (\Sigma \dashv \Omega) 
  \;\colon\;
  Top^{\ast/}
  \longrightarrow
  Top^{\ast/}
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{TopQuillenIsTopological} this is a [[Quillen adjunction]]. Hence the statement follows with prop. \ref{QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories}.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Final remark

What is called _[[stable homotopy theory]]_ is the result of universally forcing the $(\Sigma\dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunction]] of prop. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopAreAdjointOnHomotopyCategory} to become an [[equivalence of categories]].

The two originals

* {#Quillen67} [[Daniel Quillen]], _Axiomatic homotopy theory_ in  _Homotopical algebra_, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, No. 43 43, Berlin (1967)

* {#Brown73} [[Kenneth Brown]], _[[Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology]]_, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 186 (1973), 419-458  ([JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1996573))

are still an excellent source. For further reading on homotopy theory and stable homotopy theory a useful collection is

* {#James95} [[Ioan Mackenzie James]], _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_ 1995

The modern chromatic picture originates around

* {#Hopkins99} [[Mike Hopkins]], _[[Complex oriented cohomology theories and the language of stacks]]_, 1999 

a useful survey is in

* {#Wilson13} [[Dylan Wilson]] section 1.2 of _Spectral Sequences from Sequences of Spectra: Towards the Spectrum of the Category of Spectra_ lecture at _[2013 Pre-Talbot Seminar](http://math.harvard.edu/~hirolee/pretalbot2013/)_, March 2013 ([[DylanWilsonOnANSS.pdf:file]])

a wealth of details is in

* {#Ravenel86} [[Doug Ravenel]], _[[Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_, 1987/2003 ([pdf](http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/mybooks/ravenelA1.pdf))

and new foundations have been laid in

* {#LurieHigherAlgebra} [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Higher Algebra]]_

Further useful lecture notes pointed to above include the following:

* {#Hatcher04} [[Alan Hatcher]], _[Spectral sequences in algebraic topology](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/SSAT/SSATpage.html)_ _II: The Adams spectral sequence_, 2004 ([pdf](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/SSAT/SSch2.pdf))

* {#Rognes12} [[John Rognes]], _The Adams spectral sequence_ (following [Bruner](#Bruner)), 2012 ([pdf](http://folk.uio.no/rognes/papers/notes.050612.pdf))
