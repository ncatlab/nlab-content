## Idea

For $p\geq 2$ a [[prime number]], the [[field]] of _complex $p$-adic numbers_ $\mathbb{C}_p$ is to the [[complex numbers]] as the [[p-adic numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are to the [[rational numbers]].

## Definition

First observe that the ordinary [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ may be characterized as follows:

the standard [[absolute value]] (norm) on the [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$ uniquely extends to an [[algebraic closure]] $\bar \mathbb{Q}$, and the [[complete field|completion]] is the complex numbers.

In direct analogy with this:

for $p \geq 2$ a [[prime number]] and $\mathbb{Q}_p$ the corresponding [[non-archimedean field]] of [[p-adic numbers]], then the [[complete field|completion]] of any [[algebraic closure]] $\bar \mathbb{Q}_p$ is the field of complex $p$-adic numbers $\mathbb{C}_p$.
