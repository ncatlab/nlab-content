__Algebraic geometry__ is a geometric study of solutions of systems of polynomial equations and generalizations. The set of zeros of a set of polynomial equations in finitely many variables over a field is called an __affine variety__ and it is equipped with a particular topology called Zariski topology, whose closed sets are subvarieties. The system of polynomial equations defines an ideal in the ring of polynomials over the ground field; the ideal is more invariant notion than taking a particular system. The quotient of the ring of polynomials by the defining ideal is the ring of coordinate functions of the affine variety; a basic theorem asserts that this ring is Noetherian algebra over a ground field. This ring determines the  variety up to a natural notion of isomorphism of varieties. Projective varieties are zeroes of systems of homogeneous polynomial equations in projective $n$-dimensional space; if the coordinates are rescaled by a common nonzero multiple by definition they still define the same point in projective space. Open subsets of affine (projective) varieties are called quasiprojective varieties. 

It is often useful to make a pullback along a morphism of fields, usually called base change. Since Grothendieck, one generalizes the coordinate rings of affine varieties by arbitrary commutative unital rings, not necessarily Noetherian nor finitely generated; and extends the opposite category of the category of commutative rings to a category of affine schemes $\mathrm{Aff}$; affine schemes are traditionally constructed by the affine spectrum functor $\mathrm{Spec}:\mathrm{commRing}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathrm{lrSp}$ into the category of locally ringed topological spaces. Points of the affine spectrum are the prime ideals of ring. Assuming axiom of choice, every affine scheme has therefore at least one point. The slice category $\mathrm{Aff}/\mathrm{Spec} F$ over a spectrum of a fixed field $F$ is containing the category of varieties over $F$ as a full subcategory. However the points of an affine variety and of the corresponding affine spectrum do not coincide: only maximal ideals are points of usual varieties. Affine schemes have a natural topology, also called a Zariski topology; the ringed spaces locally isomorphic to affine schemes are called __schemes__. Schemes include projective schemes and more generally quasiprojective schemes; if they are relative over a fixed ground field they contain the subcategories of projective (resp. quasiprojective) varieties over the same field.

Although, Grothendieck in late 1950-s envisioned many generalizations of scheme theory, his coauthor Dieudonne wrote later in EGA that algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic and formal schemes, what is clearly a too dogmatic definition. Grothendieck's school studied in addition locally affine spaces in various [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] on $\mathrm{Aff}$ (including algebraic spaces), [[algebraic stack]]s ([[Deligne-Mumford stack]]s and [[Artin stack]]s), ind-schemes and so on; in SGA the study of ringed spaces is replaced by more general [[ringed site]]s and topoi. Modern generalizations include derived schemes, almost schemes (theory of almost rings of Gabber developing after some ideas of Faltings), generalized schemes of Durov, so-called schemes over the field of one element $F_1$ of various authors, dg-schemes, slightly noncommutative $D$-schemes etc. Many ideas of scheme theory and spectral theory of rings have influenced parallel developments in the analytic setup (Stein manifolds ([see wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_manifold)), rigid analytic spaces etc.) and in the noncommutative setup giving rise to the [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].
