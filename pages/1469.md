__Algebraic geometry__ is, in origin, a [[geometry|geometric study]] of solutions of systems of [[polynomial]] equations and generalizations.

The set of zeros of a set of polynomial equations in finitely many variables over a [[field]] is called an __affine [[algebraic variety|variety]]__ and it is equipped with a particular topology called [[Zariski topology]], whose closed sets are subvarieties. The system of polynomial equations defines an [[ideal]] in the ring of polynomials over the [[ground field]]; one of the first insights of algebraic geometry is that the ideal is a more invariant notion than the original set of equations. The [[quotient object|quotient]] of the ring of polynomials by the defining ideal is the ring of coordinate functions of the affine variety; a basic theorem asserts that this ring is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] algebra over the ground field. This ring determines the variety up to a natural notion of [[isomorphism]] of varieties. __Projective varieties__ are zeroes of systems of homogeneous polynomial equations in projective $n$-dimensional space; if the coordinates are rescaled by a common nonzero multiple, then by definition they still define the same point in projective space. Open subsets of affine (or projective) varieties are called __quasiprojective varieties__.

It is often useful to take a [[pullback]] along a morphism of fields, usually called [[base change]]. Since [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]], one generalizes the coordinate rings of affine varieties to arbitrary commutative unital rings, not necessarily Noetherian nor finitely generated; and interprets the [[opposite category]] of the category of commutative rings as a category of affine [[scheme]]s $\mathrm{Aff}$; affine schemes are traditionally constructed by the affine [[spectrum]] functor $\mathrm{Spec}:\mathrm{CommRing}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathrm{lrSp}$ into the category of locally [[ringed space|ringed]] topological spaces. Points of the affine spectrum are the prime ideals of the ring. Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], every affine scheme corresponding to a ring with $0 \neq 1$ has therefore at least one point. The slice category $\mathrm{Aff}/(\mathrm{Spec} F)$ over a spectrum of a fixed field $F$ contains the category of varieties over $F$ as a full subcategory. However the points of an affine variety and of the corresponding affine spectrum do not coincide: only *maximal* ideals are points of usual varieties. Affine schemes have a natural topology, also called a Zariski topology; the ringed spaces locally isomorphic to affine schemes are called __schemes__. Schemes include projective schemes and more generally quasiprojective schemes; if they are relative over a fixed [[ground field]], then they contain the subcategories of projective (resp. quasiprojective) varieties over the same field.

Although Grothendieck in the late 1950s envisioned many generalizations of scheme theory, his coauthor Dieudonn√© wrote later in EGA that algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic and formal schemes, what is clearly a too dogmatic definition. Grothendieck's school studied in addition locally affine spaces in various [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] on $\mathrm{Aff}$ (including [[algebraic space]]s), [[algebraic stack]]s ([[Deligne-Mumford stack]]s and [[Artin stack]]s), [[ind-object|ind-schemes]] and so on; in SGA the study of ringed spaces is replaced by more general [[ringed site]]s and [[ringed topos|topoi]]. Modern generalizations include derived schemes, almost schemes (with the theory of almost rings of Gabber developing after some ideas of Faltings), generalized schemes of Durov, so-called schemes over the 'field of one element' $F_1$ of various authors, dg-schemes, slightly noncommutative $D$-schemes etc. Many ideas of scheme theory and the spectral theory of rings have influenced parallel developments in the analytic setup (Stein manifolds ([see the English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_manifold)), rigid analytic spaces, etc.) and in the noncommutative setup give rise to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].
