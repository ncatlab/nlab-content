A __subframe__ is a [[subobject]] in the category [[Frm]] of [[frames]].  More explicitly, if $L$ is a frame, then a __subframe__ of $L$ is a [[subset]] $M$ of the [[underlying set]] of $L$ such that $M$ is closed under arbitrary [[joins]] and finitary [[meets]] (including having the [[bottom]] and [[top]] elements).

In the correspondence between frames and [[locales]], a subframe corresponds to a kind of [[quotient object|quotient]] locale.  However, only [[regular epimorphism|regular]] quotients of locales behave as [[quotient space]]s for the purposes of [[topology]].  These correspond to [[regular subobject|regular]] subframes; not all subframes are regular.

Is there a convenient elementary description of when a subframe is regular?
