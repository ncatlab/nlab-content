Pólya enumeration theorem is a particular theorem in [[enumerative combinatorics]]; it serves as a basis of methods often called Pólya's enumeration (counting) theory. It is especially used in counting of graphs, including often in applications like chemistry.

The Pólya "theory" can be redone in terms of Joyal [[species]]. 

The theory can also be rederived from state sum
identities in certain positive [[TQFT]]:
