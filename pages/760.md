## Definition 

A **split monomorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $m: A \to B$ which has a [[retraction]], meaning a morphism $r: B \to A$ such that $r \circ m = 1_A$.

In such a situation one also says that $A$ is a [[retract]] of $B$, and that $A$ is a splitting of the [[idempotent]] $m \circ r: B \to B$.

The dual notion is that of [[split epimorphism]].

### characterizations

A split monomorphism can be equivalently defined as a morphism $m$ such that $C(m,X)$ is a [[surjection]] in $\mathbf{Set}$ for every object $X\colon C$; the retraction $r$ is given by the preimage of $1_A$ under $C(m,A)$.

Alternatively, it is also possible to define a split monorphism as an _absolute_ [[monomorphism]]: one such that for every functor $F$ out of $C$ $F(m)$ is a monomorphism.

## Properties

Any split monomorphism is automatically a [[regular monomorphism]] (it is the [[equalizer]] of $m\circ r$ and $1_B$), and therefore also a [[strong monomorphism]], an [[extremal monomorphism]], and (of course) a [[monomorphism]].
