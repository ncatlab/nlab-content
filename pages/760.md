## Definitions and terminology

A **split monomorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $m\colon A \to B$ in $C$ such that there exists a morphism $r\colon B \to A$ such that the [[composite]] $r \circ m$ equals the [[identity morphism]] $1_A$.  Then the morphism $r$, which satisfies the [[duality|dual]] condition, is a __[[split epimorphism]]__.

We say that:
* $r$ is a __[[retraction]]__ of $m$,
* $m$ is a __[[section]]__ of $r$,
* $A$ is a __[[retract]]__ of $B$,
* the pair $(r,m)$ is a __[[split idempotent|splitting]]__ of the [[idempotent]] $m \circ r\colon B \to B$.

A split monomorphism in $C$ can be equivalently defined as a morphism $m\colon A \to B$ such that for every [[object]] $X\colon C$, the [[function]] $C(m,X)$ is a [[surjection]] in $\mathbf{Set}$; the preimage of $1_A$ under $C(m,A)$ yields a retraction $r$.

Alternatively, it is also possible to define a split monomorphism as an __absolute monomorphism__: a morphism such that for every functor $F$ out of $C$, $F(m)$ is a [[monomorphism]].  From the definition as a morphism having a retraction, it is obvious that any split monomorphism is absolute; conversely, that the image of $m$ under the [[representable functor]] $C(1,A)$ is a monomorphism reduces to the characterization above.


## Properties

Any split monomorphism is automatically a [[regular monomorphism]] (it is the [[equalizer]] of $m\circ r$ and $1_B$), and therefore also a [[strong monomorphism]], an [[extremal monomorphism]], and (of course) a [[monomorphism]].
