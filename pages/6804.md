## Idea

The [[D-brane]] of [[dimension]] $1+1$ in [[type IIB string theory]]. Also called the **D-string**, to be distinguished from the _fundamental_ [[string]].

## Properties

### S-duality with the fundamental string

Under [[S-duality]] the D1-brane mixes with the [[fundamental string]] to form the [[(p,q)-string]].

A formalization of this in terms of the [[homotopy theory]] of the [[super L-infinity algebras]] which constitute the respective [[extended super spacetimes]] is in ([FSS 13](#FSS13)).

### Black hole entropy

At low string coupling D1-brane/[[D5-brane]] [[bound states]] are described by 2d [[CFT]], which is well understood. After passage to the corresponding [[non-perturbative field theory|strongly coupled]] [[black brane]] configurations in [[type IIB supergravity]], which are [[black holes]] in the given [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]], the [[entropy]] of these 2d CFTs matches the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of these black holes. See at _[[black holes in string theory]]_ for more on this.

This is parts of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. See ([AGMOO, chapter 5](#AGMOO)).
