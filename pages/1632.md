An associative unital Banach algebra is [[monoid object]] in the category of [[Banach space]]s.  However, Banach algebras are not usually assumed to be unital, making them [[semigroup]] objects (or even [[magma]] objects if not assumed to be associative).

This means a Banach space $A$ equipped with a multiplication map
$$ m: A \otimes A \to A ,$$
where $\otimes$ is the standard tensor product for the symmetric monoidal closed category of Banach spaces, which again is usually taken to be associative. 

Since the norm of $a \otimes b \in A \otimes A$ is $\|a\| \cdot \|b\|$ where $\|a\|$ is the norm in $A$, and since morphisms in the category of Banach spaces are taken to be bounded linear maps of norm $\leq 1$, we may equivalently define a Banach algebra to be equipped with a bilinear map (usually associative) $A \times A \to A$ such that
$$ \|a \cdot b\| \leq \|a\| \cdot \|b\| $$
where $a \cdot b = m(a, b)$.

Of course, in the non-unital case, one can always formally adjoin a unit $e$, forming the Banach algebra $A \oplus \langle{e}\rangle$ where $\|e\| = 1$.

## Examples ##

* A standard example is $L^1(\mathbb{R}, \mu)$, where $\mu$ is Lebesgue measure, and where the multiplication is taken to be convolution. This lacks a unit for the multiplication, since there is no $L^1$ function $e(x)$ that represents the Dirac functional 
$$f \mapsto f(0) = \int e(x)f(x) d\mu$$ 
on continuous functions $f: X \to \mathbb{C}$. One can generalize this example in straightforward fashion, replacing $\mathbb{R}$ by any [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] $G$, and $\mu$ by a [[Haar measure]] on $G$; the algebra is unital if and only if $G$ is [[compact space|compact]].

* For any [[measure space]] $(X, \mu)$, $L^{\infty}(X, \mu)$ is a unital Banach algebra with respect to pointwise multiplication.

* If $A$ is a Banach space, the [[internal hom]] $hom(A, A)$ is a unital Banach algebra.

* Any $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebra]] is a Banach algebra.

* The [[normed division algebra]]s are (possibly nonassiciative) Banach algebras that are also [[division algebra]]s.
