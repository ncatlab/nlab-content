## Definitions

An associative unital Banach algebra is [[monoid object]] in the [[closed monoidal category]] of [[Banach spaces]] (with [[short linear operators]] as [[morphisms]], and the usual [[internal hom]], or equivalently the [[projective tensor product]]).  However, Banach algebras are not usually assumed to be unital, making them [[semigroup]] objects (or even [[magma]] objects if not assumed to be associative).

Explicitly, this means a [[Banach space]] $A$ equipped with a [[bilinear map|bilinear]] _multiplication_ map
$$ m\colon A \times A \to A ,$$
which again is usually taken to be associative (and may even be unital), such that
$$ {\|a \cdot b\|} \leq {\|a\|} \cdot {\|b\|} ,$$
where $a \cdot b$ (or just $a b$) means $m(a, b)$.

Of course, in the non-unital case, one can always formally adjoin a unit $e$ with ${\|e\|} = 1$, forming the Banach algebra $A \oplus \langle{e}\rangle$ (using the $l^1$-[[l-1-direct sum|direct sum]]).

The explicit description in terms of $m$ is of course earlier; but the abstract description as an internal monoid makes clear the correct definition of [[Banach coalgebra]]: a [[comonoid]] in the same monoidal category.


## Examples

* A standard example is $L^1(\mathbb{R}, \mu)$, where $\mu$ is Lebesgue measure, and where the multiplication is taken to be [[convolution]]. (This lacks a unit for the multiplication, since there is no $L^1$ function $e(x)$ that represents the [[Dirac functional]]
$$f \mapsto f(0) = \int e(x)f(x) d\mu$$ 
on [[continuous functions]] $f\colon X \to \mathbb{C}$.) One can generalize this example in straightforward fashion, replacing $\mathbb{R}$ by any [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] $G$, and $\mu$ by a [[Haar measure]] on $G$; the algebra is unital if and only if $G$ is [[compact space|compact]].

* For *any* [[measure space]] $(X, \mu)$, $L^{\infty}(X, \mu)$ is a unital Banach algebra (in fact a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]]) with respect to pointwise multiplication.

* If $A$ is a Banach space, the [[internal hom]] $hom(A, A)$ is a unital Banach algebra (by [[general abstract nonsense]]).

* Any $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebra]] is in particular a Banach algebra.

* The [[normed division algebra]]s are (possibly nonassiociative) Banach [[division algebras]] over $\mathbb{R}$.

* The only Banach division algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ is $\mathbb{C}$ itself, by the [[Gel’fand–Mazur theorem]].
