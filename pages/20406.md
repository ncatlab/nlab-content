## Idea

Various kinds of ([[mathematical structures|mathematical]]) [[structures]] have classifications by which the possible examples/cases of these structures are elements either 

1. of some infinite sequence of such structures, following some systematic construction rule, 

1. or else of a (typically [[finite set|finite]]) [[set]] of examples which follow no such rule. 

In the second case, these "unsystematic" examples of the given kind of [[structure]] are then often called _exceptional_ or _sporadic_.

Exceptional structures are often related to one another. For example, the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2]] is the [[symmetry group]] of the [[octonions]], and the other [[exceptional Lie groups]] are related to the [[octonions]] in the [[Freudenthal magic square]], while the [[Albert algebra]] is the [[exceptional Jordan algebra]] of 3-by-3 hermitian matrices over the octonions. The [[Leech lattice]] is related to the [[Monster simple group]], and can also be connected with the octonions ([Wilson 09](#Wilson09)).
