## Idea

Various kinds of ([[mathematical structures|mathematical]]) [[structures]] have classifications by which the possible examples/cases of these structures are elements either 

1. of some infinite sequence of such structures, following some systematic construction rule, 

1. or else of a (typically [[finite set|finite]]) [[set]] of examples which follow no such rule. 

In the second case, these "unsystematic" examples of the given kind of [[structure]] are then often called _exceptional_ or _sporadic_.

Exceptional structures are often related to one another. For example, [[G2]] is the symmetry group of the [[octonions]], and the other [[exceptional Lie groups]] are related to the octonions in the [[Freudenthal magic square]], while the [[Albert algebra]] is the [[exceptional Jordan algebra]] of 3-by-3 hermitian matrices over the octonions. The [[Leech lattice]] is related to the [[Monster simple group]].

## Examples

* [[exceptional Lie groups]]

  * [[G2]], [[F4]], [[E6]], [[E7]], [[E8]]

  * [[E9]], [[E10]], [[E11]], ...

* exceptional [[finite rotation groups]]:

  [[tetrahedral group]], [[octahedral group]], [[icosahedral group]]

* [[exceptional Jordan algebra]], [[Albert algebra]]

* [[sporadic finite simple group]], [[Monster group]]

* [[Leech lattice]]

* [[Cayley plane]]
