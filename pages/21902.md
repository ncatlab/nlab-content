## Idea

Given a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X, g)$ with [[metric tensor]] $g$, its _signature_ is the signature of $g$ as a [[quadratic form]] on any [[tangent space]] of $X$, in the sense of _[[signature of a quadratic form]]_.

If $(X,g)$ is regarded as a model for [[spacetime]], then this is also called _spacetime signature_.

Here the case of signature $(-,+, \cdots, +)$ corresponds to [[Lorentzian geometry]], being the basis of Einstein-[[gravity]] in the sense of "[[general relativity]]".

The case of signature $(+,+, \cdots, +)$ corresponds to [[Riemannian geometry]] (as opposed to [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry|pseudo-Riemannian]]). In a context of [[spacetime]] models this pertains for instance to the usual [[fibers]] in [[KK-compactifications]], or to all of spacetime after "[[Wick rotation]]" ([[Euclidean gravity]]).

Spacetime signatures of the form $(-,\cdots,-, +,\cdots, +)$ have been considered in the context of [[D=12 supergravity]] and [[D=14 supersymmetry]].
