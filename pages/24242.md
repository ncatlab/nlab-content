> **Abstract.** [[homotopy theory|Homotopy theory]] can be developed [[synthetic homotopy theory|synthetically]] in homotopy type theory, using [[types]] to describe spaces, the [[identity type]] to describe paths in a space, and iterated identity types to describe higher-dimensional paths. While some aspects of homotopy theory have been developed synthetically and [[Formalized Homotopy Theory|formalized]] in [[proof assistants]], some seemingly easy examples have proved difficult because the required manipulations of paths becomes complicated. In this paper, we describe a [[cubical]] approach to developing homotopy theory within type theory. The [[identity type]] is complemented with higher-dimensional cube types, such as a type of [[squares]], dependent on four points and four lines, and a type of three-dimensional [[cubes]], dependent on the boundary of a cube. Path-over-a-path types and higher generalizations are used to describe cubes in a fibration over a cube in the base. These higher-dimensional cube and path-over types can be defined from the usual identity type, but isolating them as independent conceptual abstractions has allowed for the formalization of some previously difficult examples.
