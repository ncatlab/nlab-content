###### Definition

An (commutative) **adic ring** is a ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[topological ring]] $A$ and an ideal $I \subset A$ such that

1. the [[topological space|topology]] on $A$ is the $I$-[[adic topology]];

1. the canonical morphism

   $$
     A \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n (A/I^n)
   $$

   to the [[limit]] over [[quotient rings]] by powers of the ideal is an [[isomorphism]].

A [[homomorphism]] of adic rings is a ring [[homomorphism]] that is also a [[continuous function]]. This gives a category $AdicRing$ and a subcategory $AdicCRing$ of commutative adic rings.

The [[opposite category]] of $AdicRing$ is that of affine [[formal schemes]].

Similarly, for $R$ any fixed [[commutative ring]], then adic rings under $R$ are _adic $R$-algebras_. We write $Adic A Alg$ and $Adic A CAlg$ for the corresponding categories.
