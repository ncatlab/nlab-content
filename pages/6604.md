_Calogero_ models comprise several [[integrable system]]s in classical mechanics and their relatives; they are describing interacting systems of $n$ particles on a circle or on a line. Basic variants include Calogero-Moser system, Calogero-Sutherland system and "relativistic" Ruijsenaars models. Calogero-Moser system was a historical source of the study of [[Dunkl operator]]s and Cherednik's double Hecke algebras. The Calogero-Moser system can also be related to the $n$-soliton solutions of KdV system; the elucidation of the relation between the soliton solutions and solutions of the Calogero-Moser system is rather deep and is called __Calogero-Moser correspondence__. Its modern formulation involves [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].
