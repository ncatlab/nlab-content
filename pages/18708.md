## Idea

[[Complexity theory]] is an area of research in [[computer science]] that aims to determine the amount of resources ([[time]] and [[space]] usually) that an [[algorithm]] needs to decide a query. **Descriptive complexity** is a branch of complexity theory that uses sentences in finite [[model theory]] to describe queries. It turns out that the [[languages]] of these sentences directly correspond to known [[complexity classes]].
