## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]/[[differential cohesion]] the _infinitesimal flat modality_ is the [[right adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[infinitesimal shape modality]]. 

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  Red \dashv &#643;_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf}
  \,,
$$

where $Red$ and $\flat_{inf}$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $&#643;_{inf}$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

Here $\flat_{inf}$ is the **infinitesimal flat modality**.
