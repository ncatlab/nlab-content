## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]/[[differential cohesion]] the _infinitesimal flat modality_ is the [[right adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[infinitesimal shape modality]]. 

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]] forming two pairs of [[adjoint modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
  \,,
$$

where $\Re$ and $\& $ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $\Im$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

Here $\& $ is the **infinitesimal flat modality**. 

## Properties

### Relation to crystalline cohomology

For $A$ a [[geometric homotopy type]], $\& A $ is the [[coefficient]]
for [[crystalline cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $A$. See there for more.
