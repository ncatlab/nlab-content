## Idea ##
Barreled spaces are [[topological vector spaces]] for which the theorem of [[Banach-Steinhaus]] is valid. This theorem says, roughly, that for a set of continuous linear maps $L(E, F)$ from a barreled space $E$ to a [[locally convex]] [[TVS]] boundedness in the topology of pointwise convergence implies boundedness in the topology of bounded convergence.

## Abstract ##
...

## Definition ##
A subset $T \subset E$ of a [[TVS]] E is a **barrel** if it is

* absorbing

* balanced

* closed

* convex

A [[TVS]] $E$ is **barreled** if every barrel is a neighborhood of zero. 

Sometimes [[locally convex]] is included in the definition, this is not implied by barreled as defined above, i.e. there are barreled spaces that are not locally convex.

In the definition of **quasibarreled** the barrels are replaced by sets that are barrels and which absorb all bounded sets (sets with the latter property are also called **bornivorous**).

###### Proposition
A [[locally convex]] [[TVS]] is barreled iff its topology is the [[strong topology]].

## Examples ##
Since all [[locally convex]] [[TVS]] that are [[Baire spaces]] are barreled, the examples naturally include [[Fr√©chet spaces]], [[Banach spaces]] and [[Hilbert spaces]].
