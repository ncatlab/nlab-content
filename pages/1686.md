## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of _spectral sequence_ is an [[algorithm]] or computational tool in [[homological algebra]] and more generally in [[homotopy theory]] which allows to compute [[chain homology|chain homology groups]]/[[homotopy groups]] of _bi_-[[graded objects]] from the homology/homotopy of the two graded components. 

Notably there is a spectral sequence for computing the homology of the [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] from the homology of its row and column complexes separately.
This in turn allows to compute [[derived functors]] of composite functors $G\circ F$ from the double complex $\mathbb{R}^\bullet G (\mathbb{R}^\bullet F(-))$ obtained by non-totally deriving the two functors separately (called the [Grothendieck spectral sequence](#GrothendieckSpectralSequence)). By choosing various functors $F$ and $G$ here this gives rise to various important classes of examples of spectral sequences, see [below](#SpecialGrothendieckSpectralSequence).

More concretely, a homology spectral sequence is a sequence of graded chain complexes that provides the higher order corrections to the _na&iuml;ve_ idea of computing the homology of the [[total complex]] $Tot(V)_\bullet$ of a [[double complex]] $V_{\bullet, \bullet}$: by first computing those of the vertical differential, then those of the horizontal differential induced on these vertical homology groups (or the other way around). This simple idea in general does not produce the correct homology groups of $Tot(V)_\bullet$, but it does produce a "first-order approximation" to them, in a useful sense. The spectral sequence is the sequence of higher-order corrections that make this naive idea actually work.

Being, therefore, an iterative perturbative approximation scheme of bigraded differential objects, fully-fledged spectral sequences can look a bit intricate. However, a standard experience in mathematical practice is that for most problems of practical interest the relevant spectral sequence "perturbation series" yields the exact result already at the second stage. This reduces the computational complexity immensely and makes spectral sequences a wide-spread useful computational tool.

Traditionally, as in the example of the total complex of double complex, spectral sequences are considered in the context of [[model structure on chain complexes|model categories of chain complexes]] in some [[abelian category]] for which [[fibrant replacement]] is given by [[injective resolution]] of [[chain complexes]].
But more generally there is a notion of [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]]/unstable spectral sequences, called **homotopy spectral sequences**.

Despite their name, there is nothing specifically "spectral" about spectral sequences, for none of the technical meanings of the word [[spectrum]]. Together with the concept, this term was introduced by [[Jean Leray]] and has long become standard, but was never really motivated (see p. 5 of [Chow](#Chow)).

## Definition

We give the general definition of a (co)homology spectral sequence. For motivation see the example _[Spectral sequence of a filtered complex](#SpectralSequenceOfFilteredComplex)_ below.

Throughout, let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]]. 

### Spectral sequence

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A __cohomology spectral sequence__ in $\mathcal{A}$ is 

* a family $(E^{p,q}_r)$ of [[objects]] in $\mathcal{A}$, for all [[integers]] $p,q,r$ with $r\geq 1$ 

  (for a fixed $r$ these are said to form the __$r$-th page__ of the spectral sequence)

* for each $p,q,r$ as above a [[morphism]] (called the __differential__) 
  
  $$
    d^{p,q}_r:E^{p,q}_r\to E^{p+r,q-r+1}_r
  $$ 

  satisfying $d_r^2 = 0$ (more precisely, $d_r^{p+r,q-r+1}\circ d_r^{p,q} = 0$)

* [[isomorphisms]] $\alpha_r^{p,q}: H^{p,q}(E_r)\to E^{p,q}_{r+1}$ where 
  the [[chain cohomology]] is given by
  
  $$
    H^{p,q}(E_r) = \mathrm{ker} d^{p,q}_r/ \mathrm{im} d^{p-r,q+r-1}_r
   \,.
  $$

=--

Analogously a **homology spectral sequence** is collection of objects $(E_{p,q}^r)$ with the differential $d_r$ of degree $(-r,r-1)$.



### Convergence

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(convergence)**

A component of a spectral sequence $(E_r)$ **converges** at $(p,q)$ if there exists finite $r$ such that $E_r^{p,q} \simeq E_{r+1}^{p,q} \cdots =: E_\infty^{p,q} $. One writes this as

$$
  E^{p,q}_r \Rightarrow E^{p,q}_\infty
  \,.
$$

A spectral sequence is said to **degenerate** in the $E_r$-term if $d^{p,q}_{r'} = 0$ for all $r'\geq r$. Then clearly it converges degreewise.

A spectral sequence is called **bounded** if for each $r$ and $n$ there are only finitely many non-vanishing terms of the form $E_r^{p,n-p}$. Also a bounded spectral sequence converges degreewise.

A spectral sequence $(E_r)$ **converges** if it converges degreewise to a graded filtration: if there is a graded object $(H^n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ equipped in each degree with a _finite_ filtration

$$
  0 \subset \cdots \subset F^{p} H^n \subset F^{p-1}H^n  \subset \cdots \subset F^0 H^n := H^n
$$

such that

$$
  E_\infty^{p,q}  \simeq F^p H^{p+q} / F^{p+1}H^{p+q}
  \,.
$$

The notation for this is

$$
  E_r^{p,q} \Rightarrow H^{p+q}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In applications one is interested in computing the $H^n$ and uses spectral sequences converging to this as tools for approximating $H^n$ in terms of the given filtration.

Therefore usually spectral sequences are required to converge in each degree, or even that for each pair $(p,q)$ there exists an $r_0$ such that for all $r\geq r_0$, $d_r^{p-r,q+r-1} = 0$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(Collapse)**

A spectral sequence **collapses** at $r$ if in $E_r^{p,q}$ only a single row or a single column in non-vanishing.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Observation


If $(E_r)$ collapses at $r$, then it converges to $H^\bullet$ with $H^n$ being the unique entry $E^{p,q}_r$ on the non-vanishing row/column with $p+q = n$.

## Examples

The basic class of examples are

* [Spectral sequences of filtered complexes](#SpectralSequenceOfFilteredComplex)

which compute the cohomology of a [[filtered object|filtered complex]] from the cohomologies of its [[associated graded objects]]. 

From this one obtains as a special case the class of 

* [Spectral sequences of double complexes](#SpectralSequenceOfADoubleComplex)

which compute the cohomology of the [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] using the two canonical filtrations of this by row- and by column-degree.

From this in turn one obtains as a special case the class of

* [Grothendieck spectral sequences](#GrothendieckSpectralSequence)

which compute the [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{R}^\bullet(G \circ F (-))$ of the composite of two functors from the spectral sequence of the double complex $\mathbb{R}^\bullet (F (\mathbb{R}^\bullet G (-)))$.

Many special cases of this for various choices of $F$ and $G$ go by special names, see at _[List of examples](#ListOfExamples)_.

### Spectral sequence of a filtered complex
 {#SpectralSequenceOfFilteredComplex}

If a cochain complex $C^\bullet$ is given a filtration $F^\star C^\bullet$, there is an induced filtration $F^* H(C)$ of its cohomology, according to which levels of the filtration contain representatives for the various cohomology classes.

A filtration $F$ also gives rise to a graded object $Gr(F)$, whose grades are the successive level inclusion cokernels.  Generically, the operations of grading and homology do not commute: $Gr(F^* H^\bullet(C)) \neq H^\bullet (Gr(F^\star) C)$.

There is a spectral sequence associated to a filtered complex $F^\star C^\bullet$, passing through $H^\bullet (Gr(F^\star) C)$ in the page $E_{(1)}$ and which in good cases converges to $Gr(F^* H^\bullet(C))$.

This is discussed at _[[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]]_

#### Spectral sequence of a double complex
 {#SpectralSequenceOfADoubleComplex}

The [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] is naturally filtered in two ways: by columns and by rows. By the above this gives two different spectral sequences associated computing the cohomology of a double complex from the cohomologies of its rows and columns.

### Grothendieck spectral sequence 
 {#GrothendieckSpectralSequence}

Let $\mathcal{A} \stackrel{F}{\to} \mathcal{B} \stackrel{G}{\to} \mathcal{C}$ be two [[left exact functors]] between [[abelian categories]].

Write $R^p F : \mathcal{D} \to Ab$ for the [[cochain cohomology]] of the [[derived functor]] of $F$ in degree $p$ etc. 


+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $F$ sends [[injective objects]] of $\mathcal{A}$ to $G$-[[acyclic objects]] in $\mathcal{B}$ then for each $A \in \mathcal{A}$ there is a [first quadrant](#FirstQuadrant) cohomology spectral sequence

$$
  E_r^{p,q} := (R^p G \circ R^q F)(A) 
$$

that converges to the right [[derived functor]] of the composite functor


$$
  E_r^{p,q} \Rightarrow R^{p+q} (G \circ F)(A).
$$

Moreover

1. the edge maps in this spectral sequence are the canonical morphisms
 
   $$
     R^p G (F A) \to R^p (G \circ F)(A)
   $$

   induced from applying $F$ to an injective resolution 
   $A \to \hat A$ and the [[isomorphism]]

   $$
     R^q (G \circ F)(A) \to G(R^q F (A))
     \,.
   $$

1. the [[exact sequence]] of low degree terms is

   $$
     0 \to (R^1 G)(F(A)) \to R^1(G \circ F)(A)
      \to F(R^1(G(A)))
      \to (R^2 F)(G(A))
      \to R^2(G \circ F)(A)
   $$

=--

This is called the _[[Grothendieck spectral sequence]]_.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since for $A \to \hat A$ an injective [[resolution]] of $A$ the complex $F(\hat A)$ is a chain complex not concentrated in a single degree, we have that $R^p (G \circ F)(A)$ is equivalently the [[hyper-derived functor]] evaluation $\mathbb{R}^p(G) (F(A))$.

Therefore the second spectral sequence discussed at [hyper-derived functor spectral sequences](#HyperDerivedFunctors) converges as

$$
  (R^p G)H^q(F(\hat A)) \Rightarrow R^p (G \circ F)(A)
  \,.
$$

Now since by construction $H^q(F(\hat A)) = R^q F(A)$ this is a spectral sequence

$$
  (R^p G)(R^q F) A) \Rightarrow R^p (G \circ F)(A)
  \,.
$$

This is the Grothendieck spectral sequence.

* [Base-change spectral sequence](#BaseChangeSpectralSequence)

#### Leray spectral sequence
 {#LeraySpectralSequence}

The _[[Leray spectral sequence]]_ is the special case of the 
[[Grothendieck spectral sequence]] for the case where the two functors being composed are a [[direct image|push-foward]] of [[sheaves]] of [[abelian groups]] along a [[continuous map]] $f : X \to Y$ followed by the push-forward $X \to *$ to the point. This yields a spectral sequence that computes the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] on $X$ in terms of the abelian sheaf cohomology on $Y$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $X, Y$ be suitable [[sites]] and $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of sites. () Let $\mathcal{C} = Ch_\bullet(Sh(X,Ab))$ and $\mathcal{D} = Ch_\bulle(Sh(Y,Ab))$ be the [[model structure on chain complexes|model categories of complexes of sheaves of abelian groups]]. The [[direct image]] $f_*$ and [[global section]] functor $\Gamma_Y$ compose to $\Gamma_X$:

$$
  \Gamma_X : \mathcal{C} \stackrel{f_*}{\to} \mathcal{D} \stackrel{\Gamma_Y}{\to} Ch_\bullet(Ab)
  \,.
$$

Then for $A \in Sh(X,Ab)$ a sheaf of abelian groups on $X$ there is a cohomology spectral sequence

$$
  E_r^{p,q} := H^p(Y, R^q f_* A)
$$

that converges as

$$
  E_r^{p,q} \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(X, A)
$$

and hence computes the cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ in terms of the cohomology of $Y$ with coefficients in the push-forward of $A$.

=--

#### Base change spectral sequence for $Tor$ and $Ext$
 {#BaseChangeSpectralSequence}

For $R$ a [[ring]] write $R$[[Mod]] for its category of [[modules]].
Given a [[homomorphism]] of [[ring]]s $f : R_1 \to R_2$ and an $R_2$-[[module]] $N$ there are composites of [[base change]] along $f$ with the [[hom-functor]] and the [[tensor product]] functor

$$
  R_1 Mod \stackrel{\otimes_{R_1} R_2}{\to} R_2 Mod \stackrel{\otimes_{R_2} N}{\to} Ab
$$

$$
  R_1 Mod \stackrel{Hom_{R_1 Mod}(-,R_2)}{\to}
  R_2 Mod
  \stackrel{Hom_{R_2}(-,N)}{\to}
  Ab
  \,.
$$

The [[derived functor]]s of $Hom_{R_2}(-,N)$ and $\otimes_{R_2} N$ are the [[Ext]]- and the [[Tor]]-functors, respectively, so the Grothendieck spectral sequence applied to these composites yields a  [[base change]] spectral sequence for these.

#### Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
 {#HochschildSerreSpectralSequence}

* [[Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence]]

### Exact couples
 {: #exact_couples}

The above examples are all built on the [spectral sequence of a filtered complex](#SpectralSequenceOfFilteredComplex). An alternatively universal construciton builds spectral sequences from _exact couples_.

An **[[exact couple]]** is an exact sequence of three arrows among two objects

$$ E \overset{j}{\to} D \overset{\varphi}{\to} D \overset{k}{\to} E \overset{j}{\to}. $$

These creatures construct spectral sequences by a two-step process:

*  first, the composite $d=kj:E\to E$ is nilpotent: $d^2=0$
*  second, the homology $E'$ of $(E,d)$ supports a map $j':E'\to \varphi D$, and receives a map $k':\varphi D\to E'$.  Setting $D'=\varphi D$, by general nonsense
$$ E' \overset{j'}{\to} D' \overset{\varphi}{\to} D' \overset{k'}{\to} E' \overset{j'}{\to}. $$
is again an exact couple.

The sequence of complexes $(E,d),(E',d'),\dots$ is a spectral sequence, by construction.

Examples of exact couples can be constructed in a number of ways.  Importantly, any short exact sequence involving two distinct chain complexes provides an exact couple among their total homology complexes, via the Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence; in particular, applying this procedure to the relative homology of a filtered complex gives precisely the spectral sequence of the filtered complex described (???) somewhere else on this page.  For another example, choosing a chain complex of flat modules $(C^\dot,d)$, tensoring with the short exact sequence
$$ \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} $$
gives the exact couple

$$ 
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})
    \overset{[\cdot]}{\to} 
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
   \overset{\beta}{\to}
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
   \overset{p}{\to}H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})\cdots
$$

in which $\beta$ is the _mod-$p$ Bockstein_ homomorphism.

The exact couple recipe for spectral sequences is notable in that it doesn't mention any grading on the objects $D,E$; trivially, an exact couple can be specified by a short exact sequence $\coker \varphi\to E\to \ker\varphi$, although this obscures the focus usually given to $E$.  In applications, a bi-grading is usually induced by the context, which also specifies bidegrees for the initial maps $j,k,\varphi$, leading to the conventions mentioned earlier.

* $H^n/F^1 H^n \simeq E_\infty^{0,n}$.

  **Abstract** In this note we give a minimal presentation of spectral sequences following EGA. We cover essentially only that part of the theory needed in algebraic geometry. In Section 2 we start with a filtration of a complex, and show how the various pieces of a spectral sequence arise. Applying
these observations in Section 3 to two natural filtrations of the total complex of a bicomplex, we deduce two spectral sequences and discover that their first three pages are not mysterious at all: they consist of very natural invariants of the bicomplex, arranged in the obvious way. With this background we can study the Grothendieck spectral sequence in Section 4.
