##Definition via embedding#

A full [[additive category|additive]] [[subcategory]] $A$ of an [[abelian category]] $B$ is called **Quillen exact category** if it is closed under [[extensions]] (if in extension $0\to X\stackrel{j}\to Y\stackrel{p}\to Z\to 0$, $X$ and $Z$ are in $A$ then $Y$ is in $A$). It is viewed as a pair $(A,E)$ where $E$ is a class of all short exact sequences in $A$ which are [[exact sequence|exact]] in $B$.

All $j$ which appear as $j$ in an exact sequence as above are called __inflation__s or __admissible monomorphism__s. All $p$ which appear in an exact sequence as above are called __deflation__s or __admissible epimorphism__s. 

##Definition via exact structure#

A **Quillen exact category** is a pair $(A,E)$ of an [[additive category]] $A$ and a class of sequences $E$ called 'exact'.
The following axioms are required for $(A,E)$:

(QE1) The class of 'exact' sequences is closed under [[isomorphism]]s and it contains all split extensions.
For any 'exact' sequence the deflation is the [[cokernel]] of inflation and the inflation is the [[kernel]] of the deflation.

(QE2) The class of deflations is closed under [[composition]] and [[base change]] by arbitrary maps. The class of inflations is closed under compositions and [[cobase change]] by arbitrary maps. 

(QE3) If a morphism $M\to M'$ having a [[kernel]] can factor a deflation $N\to M'$ as $N\to M\to M'$ then it is a deflation. If a morphism $I\to I'$ having a cokernel can factor an inflation $I\to J$ as $I\to I'\to J$ then it is also an inflation. 

##Quillen-Gabriel embedding theorem#

For every small exact category in the sense of a pair $(A,E)$, there is an embedding $A\hookrightarrow B$ into an [[abelian category]] such that $E$ is a class of all sequences which are (short) exact in $B$.

##Applications and generalizations#

Every Quillen exact category can be made into a [[Waldhausen category]]. However some information is lost in the process. Moreover, not every Waldhausen category comes from a Quillen exact category. Both Quillen exact categories and Waldhausen categories are devised in order to do [[algebraic K-theory]]. The K-theory spectrum based on Quillen's construction and an exact category agrees with the K-theory spectrum based on the Waldhausen construction of the K-theory spectrum from its associated [[Waldhausen category]].

A. L. Rosenberg <a href="http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preprints/send?bid=3623">introduced</a> one sided generalizations of Quillen exact categories: right 'exact' categories involving deflations, and left 'exact' categories involving inflations. One of the motivations an alternative definition of higher K-theory of (right exact) categories not involving spectra. In this setup the K-theory is an example of a derived functor in nonabelian homological algebra utilizing roughly the left 'exact' structure on the category of essentially small right 'exact' categories. It is not known if this K-theory when restricted to the category of essentially small Quillen exact categories agrees with Quillen K-theory. But it has the standard properties of Quillen K-theory (devissage, exactness and so on).
The one-sided generalization inspired by ideas introduced by Keller and Vossieck in the build up of the theory of [[suspended category|suspended categories]]. 

A right 'exact' category is a category with an initial object and a Grothendieck pretopology consisting of single maps which are [[strict epimorphism]]s. The distinguisheed class of strict epimorphisms is called a right 'exact' structure, or the class of _deflations_. The construction of derived functors in this generality involves a version of [[satellite|satellites]].
