###### Definition

For $i : X \hookrightarrow Y$ an [[embedding]] of [[manifold]]s, a **tubular neighbourhood** of $X$ in $Y$ is

* a real [[vector bundle]] $E \to X$;

* an extension of $i$ to an [[isomorphism]]

  $$
    \hat i : E \to U_{i(X)}
  $$

  with an [[open neighbourhood]] of $X$ in $Y$.

###### Remark

The [[derivative]] of $\hat i$ provides an [[isomorphism]] of $E$ with the [[normal bundle]] $\nu_{X/Y}$ of $X$ in $Y$.

###### Proposition
**(tubular neighbourhood theorem)**

Every [[embedding]] does admit a tubular neighbourhood.

For instance ([DaSilva, theorem 3.1](#DaSilva)).

Moreover, tubular neighbourhoods are unique _up to [[homotopy]]_ in a suitable sense:

###### Definition

For an embedding $i X \to Y$, write $Tub(i)$ for the [[topological space]] whose underlying set is the set of tubular neighbourhoods of $i$ and whose [[topology]] is the [[subspace topology]] of $Hom(N_i X, Y)$ equipped with the [[C-infinity topology]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $X$ and $Y$ are [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]s, then $Tub(i)$ is [[contractible]] for all [[embedding]]s $i : X \to Y$.

This appears as ([Godin, prop. 31](#Godin)).
