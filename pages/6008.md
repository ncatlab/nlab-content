
## Definition

For $i : X \hookrightarrow Y$ an [[embedding]] of [[manifold]]s, a **tubular neighbourhood** of $X$ in $Y$ is

* a real [[vector bundle]] $E \to X$;

* an extension of $i$ to an [[isomorphism]]

  $$
    \hat i : E \to U_{i(X)}
  $$

  with an [[open neighbourhood]] of $X$ in $Y$.

The [[derivative]] of $\hat i$ provides an [[isomorphism]] of $E$ with the [[normal bundle]] $\nu_{X/Y}$ of $X$ in $Y$.
