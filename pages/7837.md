In [[model theory]], given a cardinal $\kappa$, a [[theory]] is __$\kappa$-categorical__ (or categorical in cardinality $\kappa$), if it has precisely one isomorphism class of models of cardinality $\kappa$. The __Morley categoricity theorem__ says that a [[first-order theory]] $T$ with countably many symbols is $\kappa$-categorical for one uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ iff $T$ is categorical in any uncountable cardinality.

Study of categoricity lead historically to the development of the [[stability theory]] in model theory, see also [[geometric stability theory]].
