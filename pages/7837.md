## Idea

In [[model theory]], given a [[cardinal]] $\kappa$, a [[theory]] is __$\kappa$-categorical__ (or _categorical in cardinality $\kappa$_), if it has precisely one [[isomorphism class]] of [[models]] of [[cardinality]] $\kappa$. 

## Properties

The __Morley categoricity theorem__ says that a [[first-order theory]] $T$ with countably many symbols is $\kappa$-categorical for one uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ iff $T$ is categorical in any uncountable cardinality. 

## Related concepts

Study of categoricity lead historically to the development of the [[stability theory]] in model theory, see also [[geometric stability theory]].
