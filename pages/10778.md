## Idea

The [[Bousfield localization of spectra]] $L_{E(n)}$ at $n$th Morava E-theory is called _chromatic localization_. The [[tower diagram|tower]] of chromatic localizations as $n$ ranges is called the _[[chromatic tower]]_, leading to the _[[chromatic filtration]]_. This is the subject of [[chromatic homotopy theory]].

## Properties

### Relation to formal groups


Chromatic localization on [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] is like the restriction to the closed substack

$$
  \mathcal{M}_{FG}^{\leq n+1}
  \hookrightarrow
  \mathcal{M}_{FG} \times Spec \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}
$$

of the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] on those of [[height of a formal group|height]] $\geq n+1$. 

(e.g. [Lurie, lect 22, above theorem 1](#LurieLect22))

In this way the localization tower at the Morava E-theories
exhibits the [[chromatic filtration]] in [[chromatic homotopy theory]].
