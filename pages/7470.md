## Idea

The notion of _enriched $(\infty,1)$-category_ is the generalization of the notion of _[[enriched category]]_ from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category theory]]. For $\mathcal{V}$ a [[monoidal (∞,1)-category]], a _$\mathcal{V}$-enriched $(\infty,1)$-category_ $C$ is 

* a [[set]]/[[class]] of [[objects]] $Obj(C)$;

* for every tuple $(a \in C,b \in C)$ an object $C(a,b) \in \mathcal{V}$ "of [[morphisms]]" from $a$ to $b$ in $C$;

* for each sequence $(a_i \in C)_{i = 0}^n$ of objects in $C$ an object $C(a_0, \cdots, a_n) \in \mathcal{V}$ "of sequences of composable morphisms _and_ their composites";

* such that these composites exist essentially uniquely and satisfy [[associativity]] in a [[coherence|coherent]] fashion.

One way to make this precise in a general abstract way should be to define $C$ to be a [[∞-algebra over an (∞,1)-operad]] in $\mathcal{V}^{\otimes}$ over [[Assoc]]${}_{Obj(C)}$, the $Obj(C)$-colored version of the [[associative operad]];

$$
  C \in Alg_{Assoc_{Obj(C)}}(\mathcal{V}^\otimes)
  \,.
$$

For $\mathcal{V} \in$ [[∞Grpd]], this should be [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]] to ordinary [[(∞,1)-categories]].

A construction that should be a model for this notion in terms of a [[model category]] presentation for $\mathcal{V}$ is discussed in ([Simpson](#Simpson)). For the case that $\mathcal{V} = $ [[∞Grpd]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] this reproduces the notion of _[[Segal categories]]_. (See there for further details and references.) The iteration of this construction yields [[Segal n-categories]], a model for [[(∞,n)-categories]].

Once a model category $V$ for $\mathcal{V}$ has been chosen, one can consider [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strict]] $\infty$-enrichments given by ordinary $V$-[[enriched categories]] equipped with a notion of weak equivalence that remembers that these are presentations for enriched $(\infty,1)$-categories. See also _[[enriched homotopical category]]_.
