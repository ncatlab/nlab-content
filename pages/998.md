__Noncommutative algebraic geometry__ is the study of 'spaces' represented by algebras or categories. 

Unlike in Connes' style [[noncommutative geometry]], the algebras in question are ordinary associative unital $k$-algebras, possibly with grading, but without topology. Categories are typically abelian, triangulated, dg-categories or $A_\infty$-categories, and they are viewed as categories of (complexes of) coherent or quasicoherent sheaves on a noncommutative algebraic scheme or a generalization.  

The subject is older than mainstream noncommutative geometry and it is very much implicit in Gabriel's thesis on nonabelian categories, published in 1960/1961. Gabriel introduced the Gabriel [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]] (consisting of injective indecomposables) which reconstructs a quasiseparated quasicompact scheme from its category of quasicoherent modules (now generalized to all schemes, as the Gabriel-Rosenberg theorem). He looked at localization functors, and corresponding subcategories (reflective and coreflective), and proved some theorems on localization of quasicoherent sheaves. At the same time, Grothendieck taught us that to study a space it is enough to have a category of sheaves on this would-be space. 

Several years later P.M. Cohn studied a prime spectrum of a ring.

Localization theory was taken more seriously around 1974-1976
when Golan and van Oystaeyen made a serious study of rings, with geometric picture in mind. Localizations were viewed as analogues of open sets. However, the lattice of torsion theories is not distributive, something which presented major difficulties at the time. Around 1995, a major descent theorem was proved by van Oystaeyen and Willaert and independently in a work of A. Rosenberg in Stockholm (1988). It is sort of generalized sheaf condition for quasicoherent modules, with respect to covers by Gabriel localizations. 

Around 1980, the Leningrad school of integrable systems (Sklyanin, Fadeev, Takhtajan) created examples of quantum groups, and soon after that were joined by Drinfeld, Novikov, and independently, Manin and Woronowicz; these in turn give good examples in affine noncommutative geometry. 

Around 1989, _noncommutative projective geometry_ was developed by Artin, Zhang and collaborators, where Serre's theorem on Proj of a graded ring is taken as a definition in the noncommutative case: quasicoherent sheaves over a Proj of a graded ring is the category of graded modules modulo the modules of finite length. They assume strong regularity properties on graded rings, limiting to the geometry which is very close to commutative projective geometry. Using [[Ore localization]] van Oystaeyen has defined another version of noncommutative projective geometry, based on a notion of schematic algebra. 

A. L. Rosenberg has developed many spectral constructions 
extending from rings to abelian categories, triangulated 
categories and right exact categories (in his sense). He has also created a categorical version of a notion of noncommutative scheme, used implicitly earlier, but published in 1998.

Homological_mirror_symmetry</a> 
by M. Kontsevich is a source of 
lots of examples of spaces of derived algebraic geometry, which are represented by triangulated categories or their
dg- or $A_\infty$-enhancements; this has been enhanced by the insight in the structure of derived categories of coherent sheaves and their deformations like Landau-Ginzburg models, by Kapranov, Orlov, Bondal, van den Bergh, Polishchuk, Bridgeland and others.
Understanding of the role of quivers in noncommutative geometry has also being stimulated by independent and original works of Lieven le Bruyn and Arfinn Laudal. 

Derived noncommutative geometry is related subject to the commutative [[derived algebraic geometry]] of C. Simpson's school. Cyclic and [[Hochschild homology]] play a major role. The most nontrivial result seem to be noncommutative version of degeneration of Hodge-to-de Rham [[spectral sequence]], conjectured by Kontsevich and in one version <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0611.5623">proved</a> by D. Kaledin.
