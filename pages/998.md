A __noncommutative algebraic geometry__ is studying 'spaces' represented by algebras or categories. 

Unlike in Connes' style [[noncommutative geometry]] algebras in question are ordinary associative unital $k$-algebras, possibly with grading, but without topology. Categories are typically abelian, triangulated, dg-categories or $A_\infty$-categories, and they are viewed as categories of (complexes of) coherent or quasicoherent sheaves on a noncommutative algebraic scheme or a generalization.  

The subject is older than mainstream noncommutative geometry and it is much implicit in Gabriel's thesis on nonabelian categories, published in 1960/1961. Gabriel introduces Gabriel [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]] (consisting of injective indecomposables) which reconstruct a quasiseparated quasicompact scheme from its category of quasicoherent modules (now generalized to all schemes, as a Gabriel-Rosenberg theorem). He looks at localization functors, and corresponding subcategories (reflective and coreflective), and proves some theorems on localization of quasicoherent sheaves. Grothendieck also teaches at the same time, that to study a space it is enough to have a category of sheaves on this would be space. 

Several years later P.M. Cohn studied a prime spectrum of a ring.

Localization theory is taken more seriously around 1974-1976
when Golan and van Oystaeyen take a serious study of rings, with geometric picture in mind. Localizations are viewed as analogues of open sets. However, the lattice of torsion theories is not distributive what presented major difficulties at the time. Around 1995, a major descent theorem has been proven by van Oystaeyen and Willaert and independently in a work of A. Rosenberg in Stockholm (1988). It is sort of generalized sheaf condition for quasicoherent modules, with respect to covers by Gabriel localizations. 

Around 1980, Leningrad school of integrable systems (Sklyanin, Fadeev, Takhtajan) create examples of quantum groups, soon after that joined by Drinfeld, Novikov, and independently, Manin and Woronowicz; these in turn give good examples in affine noncommutative geometry. 

Around 1989, the _noncommutative projective geometry_ is developed by Artin, Zhang and collaborators, where the Serre's theorem is on Proj of a graded ring is taken as a definition in noncommutative case: quasicoherent sheaves over a Proj of a graded ring is the category of graded modules modulo the modules of finite length. They assume strong regulatity properties on graded rings, limiting to the geometry which is very close to commutative projective geometry. Using [[Ore localization]] van Oystaeyen has defined another version of noncommutative projective geometry, based on a notion of schematic algebra. 

A. L. Rosenberg has developed many spectral constructions 
extending from rings to abelian categories, triangulated 
categories and right exact categories (in his sense). He has also created a categorical version of a notion of noncommutative scheme, used implicitly earlier, but published in 1998. 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry">
Homological_mirror_symmetry</a> 
by M. Kontsevich is a source of 
lots of examples of spaces of derived algebraic geometry, which are represented by triangulated categories or their
dg- or $A_\infty$-enhancements; this has been enhanced by the insight in the structure of derived categories of coherent sheaves and their deformations like Landau-Ginzburg models, by Kapranov, Orlov, Bondal, van den Bergh, Polishchuk, Bridgeland and others.
Understanding of the role of quivers in noncommutative geometry has also being stimulated by independent and original works of Lieven le Bruyn and Arfinn Laudal. 

Derived noncommutative geometry is related subject to the commutative [[derived algebraic geometry]] of C. Simpson's school. Cyclic and [[Hochschild homology]] play a major role. The most nontrivial result seem to be noncommutative version of degeneration of Hodge-to-de Rham [[spectral sequence]], conjectured by Kontsevich and in one version <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0611.5623">proved</a> by D. Kaledin.
