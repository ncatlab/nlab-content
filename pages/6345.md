## Idea

If one regards a [[quantum field theory]] from the point of view of [[FQFT]] as a [[representation]] of a [[category of cobordisms]] with structure, then it is often helpful to decompose this information into two pieces:

1. the local geometric information: the value of the field theory on [[cobordism]]s of trivial topology (punctured spheres), depending thus only on the geometry (say [[Riemannian geometry]]) of these cobordisms. For instance in the case of [[conformal field theory]] this is encoded in a [[vertex operator algebra]] (as discussed there).

1. the global topological information: to obtain a representation of all cobordisms it must be possible to consistently glue the local data assigned to cobordisms of trivial topology to obtain the data assigned to more complicated cobordisms: it must be possible to "sew" together small cobordisms to large ones. The condition on the local data induced this way is called the **sewing constraint**.

## Examples

* [[Cardy condition]]

* The [[FRS formalism]] is all about solving the sewing constraints for 2-dimensional rational [[CFT]] given the local data in terms of a [[modular tensor category]] of conformal representations.
