## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] is _conservative_ if its reflects [[equivalences in an (∞,1)-category]]. This means that on [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy categories]] it is a [[conservative functor]].

###### Theorem
In an [[(∞,1)-topos]], pullback along an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphism]] is a conservative (∞,1)-functor between [[slice (∞,1)-categories]].

###### Proof
We write in the conjectural [[internal logic]] of an (∞,1)-topos expressed as [[homotopy type theory]], with slice categories represented using dependent types.  The reader is free to translate this manually into a category-theoretic proof.

Thus, suppose $f:A\to B$ is a surjection (i.e. $\prod_{b:B} \exists_{a:A} f(a)=b$, where $\exists$ denotes the [[propositional truncation]] of $\sum$).  Let $P,Q:B\to Type$ be dependent types with a fiberwise map $g:\prod_{b:B} P(b) \to Q(b)$ which becomes a fiberwise equivalence upon restricting to $A$, i.e. such that $\prod_{a:A} IsEquiv(g(f(a)))$.  We musts how that $g$ is itself a fiberwise equivalence.

Thus, let $b:B$; we must show $IsEquiv(g(b))$.  By assumption we have $\exists_{a:A} f(a)=b$.  But $IsEquiv(g(b))$ is an [[h-proposition]], so we may strip the truncation and obtain an $a:A$ such that $f(a)=b$.  Transporting along this equality, it suffices to show $IsEquiv(g(f(a)))$, but this follows from the other assumption.
