This page is about a formalization of the concept of [[directed graphs]] that is usual in combinatorics. 
For the usual definition of directed graph in category theory, see [[quiver]]. 
For some commentary on how the two formalizations relate to one another, see [[directed graph]].
The basic connection is: every directed graph is a quiver, not every quiver is a digraph. 
(In a reasonably loose sense of "is": type-theoretically, not every directed graph is a quiver, the formalizations being different.)

## Idea

Digraphs are one of the ways to formalize the idea of *directed connections between [[points]]*: to use the [[category of sets]] and its limits, and to *choose* the *desired* connections from a usually much larger reservoir of *possible* connections. This has advantages and disadvantages. Other ways of formalization, such as [[quivers]], from the outset *start* with *only* the desired connections.

###### Definition
**(digraph; directed graphs via [[material set theory]])**

A digraph is a [[pair]] $(V,A)$ of [[sets]], with $A\subseteq V\times V\setminus\{ (v,v)\colon v\in V\}$.
The elements of $V$ are called *vertices*, the elements of $A$ are called *arcs*.

###### Definition
**(in-neighborhood, out-neighbourhood)**

Suppose $D=(V,A)$ is a digraph and $v\in V$. The *in-neighborhood* of $v$ in $D$, denoted $N^{\leftarrow}_D(v)$, is the set $\{ u\in V\colon (u,v)\in A\}$. The *in-neighborhood* of $v$ in $D$, denoted $N^{\rightarrow}_D(v)$, is the set $\{ u\in V\colon (v,u)\in A\}$.
