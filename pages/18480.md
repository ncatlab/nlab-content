This article is about "digraphs" in the usual combinatorial sense. 
For the usual notion of directed graph in category theory, see [[quiver]]. 
For some commentary on how the two formalizations relate to one another, see [[directed graph]].
The basic connection is: every directed graph is a quiver, not every quiver is a digraph. 
(In a reasonably loose sense of "is": type-theoretically, not every directed graph is a quiver, the formalizations being different.)
