## Idea ##

Grothendieck outlined, in [[Pursuing Stacks]] and [[Les Derivateurs]] a systematic approach to homotopy theory using small categories, and categories of presheaves on a small category, as models for homotopy types. An example of the latter is the category of simplicial sets, which are presheaves on the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$.

This approach has been continued in the past decade, mostly by Georges Maltsiniotis and Denis-Charles Cisinski.
