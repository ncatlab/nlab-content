## Idea ##

[[Alexander Grothendieck]] outlined, in [[Pursuing Stacks]] and [[Les Derivateurs]], a systematic approach to [[homotopy theory]] using [[small categories]], and categories of [[presheaves]] on a small category, as models for [[homotopy types]].  An example of the latter is the category of [[simplicial sets]], which are presheaves on the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$.

This approach has been continued in the past decade, mostly by [[Georges Maltsiniotis]] and [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]].
