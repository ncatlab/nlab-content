## Idea

What is called _double dimensional reduction_ is a variant of [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]] in the presence of [[branes]]: a KK-reduction of a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $d+1$ in which a $p+1$-[[brane]] propagates results in a $d$-dimensional effective spacetime with a $p+1$-brane and with a "doubly reduced" $p$-brane, which is the reduction of those original $(p+1)$-brane configurations that wrapped the compactify cycle.

## Definition
 {#Definition}

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth topos]]. For $p+1 \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn} \in \mathbf{H}$ for the universal [[moduli stack]] of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] (given by the [[Deligne complex]]). 

Notice that [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]] has the following stacky incarnation (see [here](fiber+integration+in+ordinary+differential+cohomology#ViaSmoothHomotopyType)):

###### Proposition

For $\Sigma$ an [[orientation|oriented]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k \leq p+1$, then [[fiber integration]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] is reflected by a morphism of the form

$$
  \array{
    [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn}]
    &\stackrel{\int_\Sigma}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{B}^{p+1-k}U(1)_{conn}
    \\
    \downarrow^{[\Sigma,curv]} && \downarrow^{curv}
    \\
    [\Sigma,\mathbf{\Omega}^{p+2}]
    &\stackrel{\int_\Sigma}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{p+2-k}
  }
  \,,
$$

where the vertical morphisms are the [[curvature]] maps and the bottom morphims reflects ordinary [[fiber integration]] of [[differential forms]].

###### Definition

Given a [[cocycle]] 

$$
  \nabla \;\colon\; X \times \Sigma \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn}
  \,,
$$

on the [[Cartesian product]] of some [[smooth space]] $X$ with $\Sigma$, then its _double dimensional reduction_ is the cocycle on $X$ which is given by the composite

$$
  X \longrightarrow [\Sigma, X \times \Sigma]
  \stackrel{[\Sigma,\nabla]}{\longrightarrow}
  [\Sigma,\mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn}]
  \stackrel{\int_\Sigma}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{B}^{p+1-k}U(1)_{conn}
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] of the ([[Cartesian product]] $\dashv$ [[internal hom]])-[[adjunction]].

## Examples

### Reduction on the circle
 {#ReductionOnTheCircle}

+-- {: .num_example #ReductionOnTheCircle}
###### Example

When $\Sigma = S^1$ is the [[circle]], and we think of $X \times S^1$ as a [[spacetime]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]], then $\nabla \colon X \times S^1 \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}$ may represent the [[supergravity C-field]] as a cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology. Then its double dimensional reduction in the sense of def. \ref{DoubleDimensionalReductionForDifferentialCocycles} is the differential cocycle representing the [[B-field]] on $X$, in the sense of [[string theory]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #Cyclotomic}
###### Remark

For $\Sigma = S^1$ a circle as in example \ref{ReductionOnTheCircle}, then the morphism $X \longrightarrow [\Sigma, X \times \Sigma]$ in def. \ref{DoubleDimensionalReductionForDifferentialCocycles} sends each point of $X$ to the loop in $X\times S^1$ that winds identically around the copy of $S^1$ at that point. Hence in this case it would make sense to consider, more generally, for each $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ the "order $p$" double dimensional reduction, given by the operation where one instead considers the map that lets the loop wind $p$ times around the $S^1$.

The resulting double dimensional reduction is just $p$-times the original one, so in a sense nothing much is changed, but maybe it is suggestive that now we are looking at the space of $C_p$-[[fixed points]] of the [[free loop space]] (for $C_p$ the [[cyclic group]] of order $p$). In [[E-infinity geometry]] this fixed-point structure on the [[free loop spaces]] makes the derived function algebras -- the [[topological Hochschild homology]] of the original function algebras -- be [[cyclotomic spectra]].

### For general super $p$-branes

Double dimensional reduction for the super-$p$-[[branes]] in $D$ dimensions which are described by the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] corresponds to moving down and left the diagonals in the brane scan table of consistent such branes:

[[branescan.gif:pic]]

In particular 

* the [[superstring]] of [[type IIA string theory]] appears as the double dimensional reduction of the [[M2-brane]] in the [[KK-compactification]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] down to 10-dimensional [[type II supergravity]]/[[type II string theory]]. 

* the [[D4-brane]] appears as the double dimensional reduction of the [[M5-brane]] under this process;

* the double dimensional reduction of the [[super 2-brane in 4d]] is [[super 1-brane in 3d]] (see there).
