## Idea

What is called _double dimensional reduction_ is a variant of [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]] in the presence of [[branes]]: a KK-reduction of a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $d+1$ in which a $p+1$-[[brane]] propagates results in a $d$-dimensional effective spacetime with a $p+1$-brane and with a "doubly reduced" $p$-brane, which is the reduction of those original $(p+1)$-brane configurations that wrapped the compactify cycle.

## Examples

Double dimensional reduction for the super-$p$-[[branes]] in $D$ dimensions which are described by the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] corresponds to moving down and left the diagonals in the brane scan table of consistent such branes:

In particular the [[superstring]] appears as the double dimensional reduction of the [[M2-brane]] in the [[KK-compactification]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] down to 10-dimensional [[type II supergravity]]/[[type II string theory]]. Similarly the [[D4-brane]] appears as the double dimensional reduction of the [[M5-brane]] under this process
