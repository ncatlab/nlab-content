## Idea

In [[nuclear physics]] ([[quantum chromodynamics]]) the _Cheshire cat principle_ ([NNZ 85](#NNZ85)) is the observation that in the [[quark bag model]] for [[confinement|confined]] [[quarks]] inside [[hadrons]] the [[radius]] of the "bag" is not actually [[observable]]. Hence the "bag" of the the bag model disappears, leaving only its [[confinement|confined]] content behind, whence the colorful term. 

From [Rho et al. 16](AdS-QCD#RhoEtAl16):

> One can make $[$[[chiral perturbation theory]]$]$ consistent with [[QCD]] by suitably matching the [[correlators]] of the [[effective field theory|effective theory]] to those of [[QCD]] at a [[scale]] near $\Lambda$. Clearly this procedure is not limited to only one set of [[vector mesons]]; in fact, one can readily generalize it to an infinite number of hidden [[gauge fields]] in an [[effective field theory|effective]] [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian]]. In so doing, it turns out that a fifth dimension is "deconstructed" in a (4+1)-dimensional (or 5D) [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] type form. We will see in Part III that such a structure arises, [[top-down model building|top-down]], in [[string theory]].

> $[$this [[holographic QCD]]$]$ model comes out to describe — unexpectedly well — low-energy properties of both [[mesons]] and [[baryons]], in particular those properties reliably described in quenched [[lattice QCD]] simulations.

> $[...]$

> One of the most noticeable results of this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]] is the first derivation of vector dominance (VD) that holds both for mesons and for baryons. It has been
somewhat of an oddity and a puzzle that Sakurai’s [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] — with the lowest [[vector mesons]] [[rho meson|ρ]] and ω — which held very well for [[pion|pionic]] [[form factors]] at low momentum transfers famously failed for nucleon form factors. In this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]], the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] comes out automatically for both the [[pion]] and the [[nucleon]] provided that the infinite $[$[[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-]]$]$tower is included. While the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] for the [[pion]] with the infinite tower is not surprising given the successful Sakurai VD, that the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] holds also for the [[nucleons]] is highly nontrivial. $[...]$ It turns out to be a consequence of a [[AdS/QCD|holographic]] [[Cheshire cat principle|Cheshire Cat phenomenon]]
