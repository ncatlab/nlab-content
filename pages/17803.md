## Idea

The _smooth Serre-Swan theorem_ ([Nestruev 03, 11.33](#Nestruev03)) states that over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, 

1. the [[section]] [[functor]]

   $$
     \Gamma_X(-)
      \;\colon\;
     SmoothVectorBundles_{/X} 
       \hookrightarrow
     C^\infty(X) Mod
   $$

   that sends [[smooth vector bundles]] over $X$ of [[finite number|finite]] [[rank]] to their [[spaces of sections|spaces of]] smooth [[sections]], regarded as [[modules]] over the [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]] on $X$, is a [[fully faithful functor]]
   
   ([Nestruev 03, theorem 11.29](#Nestruev03));

1. its [[essential image]] consists precisely of the [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] [[projective modules]] 

   ([Nestruev 03, 11.32](#Nestruev03)).

This is the variant for [[differential geometry]] of what the [[Serre-Swan theorem]] asserts in [[algebraic geometry]] and in [[topology]].

Together with the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]], the smooth Serre-Swan theorem states that that differential geometry is "more algebraic" than it may superficially seem.

A third fact in this vein is that _[[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]]_.
