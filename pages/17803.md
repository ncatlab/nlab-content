## Idea

The _smooth Serre-Swan theorem_ states that over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, smooth [[vector bundles]] of [[finite number|finite]] [[rank]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] [[projective modules]] over the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] $C^\infty(X)$ of [[smooth functions]] on $X$. ([Nestruev 03, 11.33](#Nestruev03))

This is the variant for [[differential geometry]] of what the [[Serre-Swan theorem]] asserts in [[algebraic geometry]] and in [[topology]].

Together with the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]], the smooth Serre-Swan theorem states that that differential geometry is "more algebraic" than it may superficially seem.
