## Idea

A special case of _[[G-structure]]_.

For $G \to K$ a [[monomorphism]] of groups, a $G$-structure on a $K$-[[principal bundle]] is a _reduction_ of the [[structure group]] from $K$ to $G$.

Alternatively, for $G \to K$ an [[epimorphism]] of groups, a $G$-structure on a $K$-[[principal bundle]] is a _lift_ of the structure group from $K$ to $G$.

The distinction between epimorphism and monomorphism is, however, not quite "homotopy correct". For instance in the first steps of the [[Whitehead tower]] of the [[orthogonal group]]

$$
  Spin(n) \to SO(n) \hookrightarrow O(n) (\hookrightarrow GL(n))
$$

the morphism $Spin(n) \to SO(n)$ is epi, while $SO(n) \to O(n)$ is mono.
