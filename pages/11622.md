It is well known that when the [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|higher Chern-Simons term]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] is [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on a 4-sphere to yield the [[7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] which inside [AdS7/CFT6](AdS-CFT#AdS7CFT6) is dual to the [[M5-brane]] [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]], the [[cup product]] square in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that enters its definition is to receive a [[quadratic refinement]]. This was originally argued in ([Witten 97](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/7d+Chern-Simons+theory#Witten97)) and then formalized and proven in ([[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology, and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 02]]).

What though is the situation up in 11 dimensions before compactifying to 7-dimensions?

In ([DFM 03, section 9](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/supergravity+C-field#DFM)) it is claimed that the full 11-dimensional Chern-Simons term evaluated on the [[supergravity C-field]] (with its flux quantization correction, see there) indeed carries a _cubic refinement_.

More precisely, and slightly paraphrasing, the [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology|transgression]] $\int_X CS_{11}(\hat C)$ of the [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|11-dimensional Chern-Simons term]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity|11d SuGra]]  to 10d spacetime $X$ is a [[complex line bundle]] on the [[moduli space]] $CField(X)$ of [[supergravity C-field|supergravity C-fields]] $\hat C$ is claimed to be such that its "cubical line" $\Theta^3(\int_X CS_{11}(\hat C))$ (in the notation at _[[cubical structure on a line bundle]]_) is the  line bundle on the space of triples of C-field configurations which is given by the transgression of the three-fold [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology]], 

$$
  \Theta^3\left(\int_X CS_{11}\left(-\right)\right)
  \simeq
  \int_X (-)_1 \cup (-)_2 \cup (-)_3
  \,.
$$

## Relation to F-theory and the topological Witten genus

In the context of "[[F-theory]] compactifications" of [[M-theory]], one considers [[supergravity C-field|C-fields]] on an [[elliptic fibration]] which are "factorizable fluxes", in that their underlying [[cocycle]] $\hat C$ in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] is the [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology|cup product]] of a cocycle $\hat C_{fib}$ on the fiber with one $\hat C_b$ on the base

$$
  \hat C \coloneqq \hat C_{b} \cup \hat C_{fib}
 \,.
$$

In approaches like ([GKP 12 (around p. 19)](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/F-theory#GKP12), [KMW 12](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/F-theory#KMW12)) the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] is factored as a [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology|cup product]] of a degree-2 cocycle on the elliptic fiber with a degree-2 classin the [[Calabi-Yau space|Calabi-Yau]]-base. This makes the component of the C-field on the elliptic fiber a [[complex line bundle]] (with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]). Notice that the space of complex line bundles on an elliptic curve is dual to the elliptic curve itself.

On the other hand in  e.g. ([DFM 03, p.38](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/supergravity+C-field#DFM)) the factorization is  taken to be that of two degree-3 cocycles in the base (which are then identified with the combined degree-3 [[RR-field]]/[[B-field]] flux coupled to the [[(p,q)-string]]) with, respectively, the two canonical degree-1 cocycles $\hat t_i$ on the elliptic fiber which are given by the two canonical coordinate functions $t_i$ (speaking of a [[framed elliptic curve]]). In this case the fiber-component of the [[supergravity C-field]] "is" the [[elliptic curve]]-fiber, 

$$
  \hat C \coloneqq \hat B_{NS} \cup \hat t_1 + \hat B_{RR} \cup \hat t_2
$$

or equivalently each pointin the moduli space of $H$-flux in 10d induces an identification of the $G$-flux with the elliptic curve this way.



This is maybe noteworthy in that when the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] is identified with the compactification  [[elliptic curve]] in this way, then the formula for $\Theta^3\left(\int_X CS_{11}(\hat C)\right)$ as [above](#Idea) is exactly that appearing in the definition of a [[cubical structure on a line bundle]] over an [[elliptic curve]]. But a "cubical" trivialization of $\Theta^3(\mathcal{O}(-\{0\}))$ over a given elliptic curve is what in ([Hopkins 02](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+orientation+of+tmf#Hopkins02), [AHS01](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+orientation+of+tmf#AndoHopkinsStrickland01)) is used to induce the [[sigma-orientation]] of the corresponding [[elliptic cohomology theory]] and in totality the [[string-orientation of tmf]]. But that is the refinement of the [[Witten genus]], hence of the [[partition function]] of the [[heterotic string]].

Now,by the above fact that $\Theta^3\left(CS_{11}(-)\right) \simeq \int_X (-)_1 \cup (-)_2 \cup (-)_3$ a cubical trivialization of $\Theta^3(L)$ is also given by a trivialization of the topological class of the C-field. This is one way (or is at least closely related) to the trivialization of the anomaly line bundle which "sets the quantum integrand" of M-theory.

So there is a curious coincidence of concepts here, which might want to become a precise identification: 

on the one hand there is naturally a [[cubical structure on a line bundle]] on the Chern-Simons line bundle over the moduli space of [[supergravity C-fields]] which for [[F-theory]] compactifications and factorizable flux configurations induces in particular a cubical structure on a line bundle over the compactification elliptic curve. On the other hand, the latter are the structures that enter the refined construction of the [[Witten genus]] via the [[string orientation of tmf]].
