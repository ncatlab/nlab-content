## Definition

A __cartesian closed category__ (sometimes: __ccc__) is a category with finite [[products]] which is [[closed monoidal category|closed]] with respect to its [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal structure]].

The [[internal hom]] $[S,X]$ in a cartesian closed category is often called [[exponentiation]] and is denoted $Y^S$.

## Examples

* Any [[topos]] or [[quasitopos]], such as [[Set]], is cartesian closed.

  See also [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]].

* [[Cat]] is also cartesian closed.

* Many [[nice category of spaces|nice categories of topological spaces]] are also cartesian closed, particularly the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient categories of spaces]].

## Some basic consequences 

A category is cartesian closed if it has finite products and if for any two objects $X$, $Y$, there is an object $Y^X$ (thought of as a "space of maps from $X$ to $Y$") such that for any object $Z$, there is a bijection between the set of maps $Z \to Y^X$ and the set of maps $Z \times X \to Y$, and this bijection is natural in $Z$. 

There is an evaluation map $ev_{X, Y}: Y^X \times X \to Y$, which by definition is the map corresponding to the identity map $Y^X \to Y^X$ under the bijection. Using the naturality, it may be shown that the bijection $\hom(Z, Y^X) \to \hom(Z \times X, Y)$ takes a map $\phi: Z \to Y^X$ to the composite 

$$Z \times X \stackrel{\phi \times 1_X}{\to} Y^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Y}}{\to} Y$$ 

and the universal property of $Y^X$ may be phrased thus: given any $\psi: Z \times X \to Y$, there exists a unique map $\phi: Z \to Y^X$ for which $\psi = ev_{X, Y} \circ (\phi \times 1_X)$. 

Taking $Z = 1$ (the terminal object), maps $1 \to Y^X$ (or "points" of $Y^X$) are in bijection with maps $X \stackrel{\pi_{2}^{-1}}{\to} 1 \times X \to Y$. So the "underlying set" of $Y^X$, namely $\hom(1, Y^X)$, is identified with the set of maps from $X$ to $Y$. Let us denote the point corresponding to $f: X \to Y$ by $[f]: 1 \to Y^X$. Then, by definition,  

$$(1 \times X \stackrel{[f] \times 1_X}{\to} Y^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Y}}{\to} Y) = (1 \times X \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y)$$

The following lemma says that the internal evaluation map $ev_{X, Y}$ indeed behaves as an evaluation map at the level of underlying sets.

######Lemma
Given a map $f: X \to Y$ and a point $x: 1 \to X$, the composite 
$$1 \stackrel{\langle [f], x \rangle}{\to} Y^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Y}}{\to} Y$$ 
is the point $f x: 1 \to Y$.

######Proof 
We have 
$$\array{
1 \stackrel{\langle [f], x \rangle}{\to} Y^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Y}}{\to} X & = & 1 \stackrel{\delta_1}{\to} 1 \times 1 \stackrel{[f] \times x}{\to} Y^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Y}}{\to} Y\\
 & = & 1 \stackrel{\delta_1}{\to} 1 \times 1 \stackrel{1 \times x}{\to} 1 \times X \stackrel{[f] \times 1_X}{\to} Y^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Y}}{\to} Y\\
 & = & 1 \stackrel{\delta_1}{\to} 1 \times 1 \stackrel{1 \times x}{\to} 1 \times X \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y\\
 & = & 1 \stackrel{\delta_1}{\to} 1 \times 1 \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} 1 \stackrel{x}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y\\
 & = & 1 \stackrel{x}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y
}$$
where the penultimate equation uses naturality of the projection map $\pi_2$.

######Definition 
**Internal composition** $c_{X, Y, Z}: Z^Y \times Y^X \to Z^X$ is the unique map such that 
$$(Z^Y \times Y^X \times X \stackrel{c \times 1_X}{\to} Z^X \times X \stackrel{ev_{X, Z}}{\to} Z) = (Z^Y \times Y^X \times X \stackrel{1 \times ev_{X, Y}}{\to} Z^Y \times Y \stackrel{ev_{Y, Z}}{\to} Z)$$ 
=-- 

One may show that internal composition behaves as the usual composition at the underlying set level, in that given maps $g: Y \to Z$, $f: X \to Y$, we have 

$$(1 \stackrel{\langle [g], [f] \rangle}{\to} Z^Y \times Y^X \stackrel{c_{X, Y, Z}}{\to} Z^X) = [g f]: 1 \to Z^X$$

## Properties

* In a cartesian closed category, the product functors $A \times -$ have [[right adjoints]], so they preserve all [[colimits]].  In particular, a cartesian closed category that has finite [[coproducts]] is a [[distributive category]].

* The [[internal logic]] of cartesian closed categories is the [[typed lambda-calculus]].

### Inheritance by reflective subcategories

In showing that a given category is cartesian closed, the following theorem is often useful (cf. A4.3.1 in the [[Elephant]]):

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If $C$ is cartesian closed, and $D\subseteq C$ is a [[reflective subcategory]], then the reflector $L\colon C\to D$ preserves finite [[products]] if and only if $D$ is an [[exponential ideal]] (i.e. $Y\in D$ implies $Y^X\in D$ for any $X\in C$).  In particular, if $L$ preserves finite products, then $D$ is cartesian closed.
