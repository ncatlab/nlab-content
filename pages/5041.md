## Idea

This text establishes a statement (theorem 5.3) that characterizes [[∞-stacks]] over an [[(∞,1)-site]] of formal duals of [[Artin ring|Artin]] [[E-infinity-ring|E-∞ algebras]] over a [[field]] (hence [[infinitesimally thickened points]] in [[derived geometry]]) such that

1. they have a contractible underlying [[∞-groupoid]]

   $$
    \Gamma X \simeq *
   $$

   (in the terminology and notation for [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]es) 

1. and respect [[(∞,1)-limit|(∞,1)-pullback]]s

with those associated to an [[∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ in the sense of ([Hinich](#Hinich))

The construction is then generalized to noncommutative geometry.
