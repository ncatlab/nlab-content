Regarded as a plain [[category]], $Top$ is the [[category]] whose [[object]]s are [[topological space|topological spaces]] and whose [[morphism]]s are continuous maps.

For purposes of [[homotopy theory]], one may want to use instead a category of [[nice topological space]]s.

More generally, Top may denote the archetypical [[(infinity,1)-category]] that is the archetypical [[(infinity,1)-topos]].
As such, Top is also the archetypical [[homotopy theory]].

In this incarnation Top (the nice version) is equivalent to [[SSet]] and [[Infinity-Grpd]].
