## Definition

**Top** denotes the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] between them. Its [[isomorphisms]] are the [[homeomorphisms]].



Often one considers (sometimes by default) [[subcategories]] of [[nice topological spaces]] such as [[compactly generated topological spaces]], notably because these are [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. There other other [[convenient categories of topological spaces]]. With any one such choice understood, it is often useful to regard it as "the" category of topological spaces.

The [[homotopy category]] of $Top$ given by its [[localization]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] is the [[classical homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]]. This is the central object of study in [[homotopy theory]], see also at _[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]_.  The [[simplicial localization]] of [[Top]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] is the archetypical [[(∞,1)-category]], [[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories|equivalent]] to [[∞Grpd]] (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_).

## Properties



### Universal constructions

We discuss [[universal constructions]] in [[Top]], such as [[limits]]/[[colimits]], etc. The following definition suggests that universal constructions be seen in the context of $Top$ as a [[topological concrete category]] (see Proposition \ref{topcat} below): 

+-- {: .num_defn #InitialAndFinalTopologies}
###### Definition

Let $\{X_i = (S_i,\tau_i) \in Top\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[class]] of [[topological spaces]], and let $S \in Set$ be a bare [[set]]. Then

* For $\{S \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S_i \}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] out of $S$, the _[[initial topology]]_ $\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[minimum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon (S,\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))\to X_i$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

* For $\{S_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S\}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] into $S$, the _[[final topology]]_ $\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[maximum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon X_i \to (S,\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalSubspace}
###### Example

For $X$ a single topological space, and $\iota_S \colon S \hookrightarrow U(X)$ a subset of its underlying set, then the initial topology $\tau_{intial}(\iota_S)$, def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, is the [[subspace topology]], making

$$
  \iota_S
  \;\colon\;
  (S, \tau_{initial}(\iota_S))
  \hookrightarrow
  X
$$

a [[topological subspace]] inclusion.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #QuotientTopology}
###### Example

Conversely, for $p_S \colon U(X) \longrightarrow S$ an [[epimorphism]], then the final topology $\tau_{final}(p_S)$ on $S$ is the _[[quotient topology]]_.

=--




+-- {: .num_prop #DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop}
###### Proposition

Let $I$ be a [[small category]] and let $X_\bullet \colon I \longrightarrow Top$ be an $I$-[[diagram]] in [[Top]] (a [[functor]] from $I$ to $Top$), with components denoted $X_i = (S_i, \tau_i)$, where $S_i \in Set$ and $\tau_i$ a topology on $S_i$. Then:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

   $$
     \array{
       && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
       \\
       S_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && S_j
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies} for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

   $$
     \array{
       S_i && \longrightarrow && S_j
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_j}}
       \\
       && \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{final}(\{\iota_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

=--

(e.g. [Bourbaki 71, section I.4](#Bourbaki71))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The required [[universal property]] of $\left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)$ is immediate: for 

$$
  \array{
    && (S,\tau)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_j}} 
    \\
    X_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && X_i
  }
$$

any [[cone]] over the diagram, then by construction there is a unique function of underlying sets $S \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i$ making the required diagrams commute, and so all that is required is that this unique function is always [[continuous function|continuous]]. But this is precisely what the initial topology ensures.

The case of the colimit is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

+-- {: .num_example #PointTopologicalSpaceAsEmptyLimit}
###### Example

The limit over the empty diagram in $Top$ is the [[point]] $\ast$ with its unique topology.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpacesIsCoproduct}
###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[coproduct]] $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i \in Top$ is their _[[disjoint union]]_.

=--

In particular:

+-- {: .num_example #DiscreteTopologicalSpaceAsCoproduct}
###### Example

For $S \in Set$, the $S$-indexed [[coproduct]] of the point, $\underset{s \in S}{\coprod}\ast $,  is the set $S$ itself equipped with the [[final topology]], hence is the [[discrete topological space]] on $S$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ProductTopologicalSpace}
###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[product]] $\underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i \in Top$ is the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets equipped with the _[[product topology]]_, also called the _[[Tychonoff product]]_.

In the case that $S$ is a [[finite set]], such as for binary product spaces $X \times Y$, then the open subsets in the product topology are just the [[Cartesian products]] of the open subsets of each factor space.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #EqualizerInTop}
###### Example

The [[equalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the equalizer of the underlying functions of sets 

$$
  eq(f,g) 
   \hookrightarrow 
  S_X 
    \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}} 
  S_Y
$$

(hence the largets subset of $S_X$ on which both functions coincide) and equipped with the [[subspace topology]], example \ref{TopologicalSubspace}.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #CoequalizerInTop}
###### Example

The [[coequalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the coequalizer of the underlying functions of sets 

$$
  S_X 
    \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}} 
  S_Y
    \longrightarrow 
  coeq(f,g)
$$

(hence the [[quotient set]] by the [[equivalence relation]] $f(x) \sim g(y)$)  and equipped with the [[quotient topology]], example \ref{QuotientTopology}.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #PushoutInTop}
###### Example

For 

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
$$

two [[continuous functions]] out of the same [[domain]], then the [[colimit]] under this diagram is also called the _[[pushout]]_, denoted

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g_\ast f}}
     \\
     X &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup_A Y
     \,.
  }
  \,.
$$

(Here $g_\ast f$ is also called the pushout of $f$, or the _[[base change|cobase change]]_ of $f$ along $g$.) If $g$ is an inclusion, one also write $X \cup_f Y$ and calls this the _attaching space_.

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;"><img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AttachingSpace.jpg" width="450"></div>

By example \ref{CoequalizerInTop} the pushout/attaching space is the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  X \sqcup_A Y \simeq (X\sqcup Y)/\sim
$$

of the [[disjoint union]] of $X$ and $Y$ subject to the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies a point in $X$ with a point in $Y$ if they have the same pre-image in $A$.

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself}
###### Example

As an important special case of example \ref{PushoutInTop},  let 

$$
  i_n \colon S^{n-1}\longrightarrow D^n
$$

be the canonical inclusion of the standard [[n-sphere|(n-1)-sphere]] as the [[boundary]] of the standard [[n-disk]] (both regarded as [[topological spaces]] with their [[subspace topology]] as subspaces of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$).


<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GluingHemispheres.jpg" width="400"></div>

Then the colimit in [[Top]] under the diagram, i.e. the [[pushout]] of $i_n$ along itself,

$$
  \left\{
     D^n \overset{i_n}{\longleftarrow} S^{n-1} \overset{i_n}{\longrightarrow}
     D^n
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

is the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{i_n}{\longrightarrow}& D^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_n}}\downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& S^n
  }
  \,.

+-- {: .num_defn #ForgetfulFunctorFromTopToSet}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  U \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
$$

for the [[forgetful functor]] that sends a topological space $X = (S,\tau)$ to its underlying set $U(X) = S \in Set$ and which regards a [[continuous function]] as a plain [[function]] on the underlying sets.

=--

Prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop} means in particular that:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The category [[Top]] has all small [[limits]] and [[colimits]]. The [[forgetful functor]] $U \colon Top \to Set$ from def. \ref{ForgetfulFunctorFromTopToSet} [[preserved limit|preserves]] and [[lifted limit|lifts]] limits and colimits.

=--

(But it does not [[created limit|create]] or [[reflected limit|reflect]] them.)

###### Proposition

The [[forgetful functor]] $U$ from def. \ref{ForgetfulFunctorFromTopToSet} has a [[left adjoint]] $disc$, given by sending a [[set]] $S$ to the corresponding [[discrete topological space]], example \ref{DiscreteTopologicalSpaceAsCoproduct}

$$
  Top
  \stackrel{\overset{disc}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  Set
  \,.
$$

=--

###### Proposition

The [[forgetful functor]] $U$ from def. \ref{ForgetfulFunctorFromTopToSet} exhibits $Top$ as 

* a [[concrete category]]

* a [[topological concrete category]].

###### Lemma 

The [[pushout]] in [[Top]] of any (closed/open) [[topological subspace]] inclusion $i \colon A \hookrightarrow B$, example \ref{TopologicalSubspace}, along any [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \to C$ is itself an a (closed/open) subspace $j \colon C \hookrightarrow D$.
