## Idea

**Top** is the [[category]] of [[topological space]]s and [[continuous map]]s between them.

How exactly this is understood depends a bit on context: of course $Top$ forms an ordinary [[category]]. But it is also naturally an [[(∞,1)-category]]. This, in turn, may be [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by regarding $Top$ as a [[model category]] equipped with the [[model structure on topological spaces|Quillen model structure]].

Moreover, what exactly counts as an object in $Top$ often varies in different contexts. For many applications it is useful to restrict to a [[subcategory]] of [[nice topological space]]s such as [[compactly generated space]]s or [[CW-complex]]es. There other other [[convenient categories of topological spaces]].

The [[homotopy category]] of $Top$ with respect to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s is [[Ho(Top)]]. This is the central object of study in [[homotopy theory]].  Regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]]  $Top$ is the archetypical [[homotopy theory]], equivalent to [[∞Grpd]].

## References

An axiomatic desciption of $Top$ building along the lines of [[ETCS]] for [[Set]] is discussed in
