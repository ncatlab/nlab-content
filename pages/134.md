## Definition

**Top** denotes the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] between them.

Often one considers (sometimes by default) [[subcategories]] of [[nice topological spaces]] such as [[compactly generated topological spaces]], notably because these are [[cartesian closed category]]. There other other [[convenient categories of topological spaces]]. With any one such choice understood, it is often useful to regard it as "the" category of topological spaces.

The [[homotopy category]] of $Top$ given by its [[localization]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] is the [[classical homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]]. This is the central object of study in [[homotopy theory]], see also at _[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]_.  The [[simplicial localization]] of [[Top]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] is the archetypical [[(∞,1)-category]], [[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories|equivalent]] to [[∞Grpd]] (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_).

###### Poposition

Let $X_\bullet \colon I \longrightarrow Top$ be a [[diagram]] in [[Top]], with components denoted $X_i = (S_i, \tau_i)$, where $S_i \in Set$ and $\tau_i$ a topology on $S_i$. Then:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]] for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

   $$
     \array{
       && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
       \\
       S_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && S_j
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]] $\tau_{final}$ for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

   $$
     \array{
       S_i && \longrightarrow && S_j
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_j}}
       \\
       && \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{final}(\{\iota_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

###### Example

* The limit over the empty diagram in $Top$ is the [[point]] $\ast$ with its unique topology.

* For $S \in Set$, the $S$-index [[coproduct]] of the point is the set $S$ itself equipped with the [[initial topology]], hence is the [[discrete topological space]] on $S$.

### Relation with $Set$

+-- {: .num_defn #ForgetfulFunctorFromTopToSet}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  U \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
$$

for the [[forgetful functor]] that sends a topological space $X = (S,\tau)$ to its underlying set $U(X) = S$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[forgetful functor]] $U$ from def. \ref{ForgetfulFunctorFromTopToSet} has a [[left adjoint]] $disc$, given by sending a [[set]] $S$ to the corresponding [[discrete topological space]]

$$
  Top
  \stackrel{\overset{disc}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  Set
  \,.
$$
