
Given a [[set]] $S$, the __identity function__ on $S$ is the [[function]] $id_S\colon S \to S$ that maps any element $x$ of $S$ to itself:
$$ id_S = (x \mapsto x) = \lambda x.\; x ;$$
or equivalently,
$$ id_S(x) = x .$$

The identity functions are the [[identity morphisms]] in the category [[Set]] of sets.

More generally, in any [[concrete category]], the identity morphism of each object is given by the identity function on its [[underlying set]].
