#Motivation#

Formal power series rings are colimits of their truncations; they can be viewed as completions and they get equipped with a natural filtration and adic topology. As they do not need to converge in any of the standard topologies (complex topology over $\mathbb{C}$ and Zariski topology), they are geometically understood as converging in *infinitesimal* neighborhood of the origin. One would like to be able to talk about functions supported only infinitesimally (in transverse direction) to a [[closed subscheme]]. The formal schemes by Grothendieck give a geometric locus a [[ringed space]] corresponding to the information on all infinitesimal neighborhoods. Zariski's theorem on formal functions and establishing the theory of [[formal group]]s were some of the concrete motivations.

#Noetherian formal schemes#

Given any ring $R$ and an ideal $I$, there is a natural homomorphisms of rings $R/I^{n+1}\to R/I^n$ for all $n\geq 0$. The inverse limit $\hat{R}:=lim_n R/I^n$ is called the _completion of $R$ at ideal $I$_ or $I$-adic completion of $R$. If $R$ is noetherian, the completion is noetherian as well. 

If $X$ is a scheme a [[closed subscheme]] $Y\subset X$ is given by an embedding of topological spaces with the [[comorphism]] $\mathcal{O}_X\to f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$ which is a surjection; but alternatively $\mathcal{O}_Y$ can be recovered from $X$ and the defining sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I}\subset \mathcal{O}_X$. Then one defines the structure sheaf of the completion $\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}}$ as the $lim_n \mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I}^n$ restricted to $Y$ and the __completion__ $\hat{X} := (Y,\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}})$. If $X = Spec\,R$ where $R$ is a noetherian $I$-adic ring, and $Y=Spec\,R/I$ then the completion $Spf\,R = \hat{X}$ is called the __formal spectrum__ of $R$ (viewed as a topological ring). It can be considered as an [[ind-object]] in the category of algebraic schemes, viewed as a formal colimit
$colim_n Spec (R/I^n)$.

A (locally) noetherian formal scheme is a formal completion of a noetherian scheme along a closed subscheme. Equivalently, a locally noetherian scheme is a locally ringed space which is locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a complete separated adic noetherian ring.

#Other approaches# 

The formal spectrum can be extended to a somewhat bigger class of topological rings than noetherian; Grothendieck developed the theory in the generality of pseudocompact topological rings. However, some important rings, e.g. the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ do not have a pseudocompact topology. Thus one could try to consider a more general subcategory of ind-schemes; one of such approaches is outlines in some detail in

Another approach using certain topological extension of Yoneda lemma on $k-Alg^{op}$ has been proposed in

N. Durov has considered a flexible bigger category (which inludes usual schemes) of covariant functors from the category of pairs $(R,I)$ where $R$ is a commutative ring and $I$ a nilpotent idea; the correspondence between formal groups and Lie algebras based on Hausdorff series is neatly developed and used in that language; see chapters 7-9 of
