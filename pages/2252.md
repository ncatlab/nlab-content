#Idea#

A _formal scheme_ is a ringed space which is (typically) not an algebraic [[scheme]]. It is instead an enlarged version of a scheme including an infinitesimal neighborhood, which is expressed in terms of structure sheaves which are closer to sheaves of completions like formal power series rings rather than the polynomial rings.

#Motivation#

Formal [[power series]] [[ring]]s $k[\![x_1,\ldots,x_n]\!]$ are limits of their truncations (e.g. in one variable $k[\![x]\!]/(x^n)$); they can be viewed as completions and they get equipped with a natural filtration and [[adic topology]].

They do not converge as a series (and make sense) in an open set or in any of the standard topologies (e.g. Zariski and complex topology over $\mathbb{Z}$), but they are rather "localized" in an *[[infinitesimal neighborhood|infinitesimal neighborhood]]* of the origin. One would like to be able to talk about functions supported only infinitesimally (in the transverse direction) to a [[closed subscheme]]. The formal schemes of [[Grothendieck]] are [[ringed spaces]] containing the information on all infinitesimal neighborhoods. Zariski's theorem on formal functions and establishing the theory of [[formal group]]s were some of the concrete motivations.


#Noetherian formal schemes#

Given any [[ring]] $R$ and an [[ideal]] $I$ of $R$, there is a natural homomorphisms of rings $R/I^{n+1}\to R/I^n$ for all $n\geq 0$. The [[inverse limit]] $\hat{R}:=lim_n R/I^n$ is called the **completion of $R$ at the ideal $I$** or the **$I$-adic completion** of $R$. If $R$ is [[noetherian ring|noetherian]], the completion is noetherian as well. 

If $X$ is a [[scheme]], a [[closed subscheme]] $Y\subset X$ is given by an embedding of topological spaces with the [[comorphism]] $\mathcal{O}_X\to f_*\mathcal{O}_Y$ which is a surjection; but alternatively $\mathcal{O}_Y$ can be recovered from $X$ and the defining sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I}\subset \mathcal{O}_X$. Then one defines the [[structure sheaf]] of the completion $\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}}$ as $lim_n \mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{I}^n$ restricted to $Y$ and the __completion__ $\hat{X} := (Y,\mathcal{O}_{\hat{X}})$. If $X = Spec\,R$ where $R$ is a noetherian $I$-adic ring, and $Y=Spec\,R/I$ then the completion is called the **[[formal spectrum]]** of $R$ denoted

$$
  Spf\,R = \hat{X}
$$ 

(where $R$ is viewed as a topological ring). The formal spectrum is an [[ind-object]] in the [[category]] of [[algebraic scheme]]s, viewed as a formal colimit
$colim_n Spec (R/I^n)$. 

A (locally) noetherian formal scheme is a formal completion of a (locally) noetherian scheme along a closed subscheme. Equivalently, a locally noetherian scheme is a locally ringed space which is locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a complete separated adic noetherian ring.


#Other approaches# 

The formal spectrum can be extended to a somewhat bigger class of topological rings than the noetherian ones; Grothendieck developed the theory in the generality of [[pseudocompact space|pseudocompact]] topological rings. However, some important rings, e.g. the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$, do not have a pseudocompact topology. Thus one could try to consider a more general subcategory of ind-schemes (with at least the requirement that the [[ind-object]] be represented by a diagram where the connecting morphisms are [[closed subscheme|closed immersions of schemes]]); one such approach is outlined in some detail in

Another approach using a certain topological extension of the [[Yoneda lemma]] on $k Alg^{op}$ has been proposed in

[[Nikolai Durov]] has considered a flexible bigger category (which inludes the usual schemes) of covariant functors from the category of pairs $(R,I)$ where $R$ is a commutative ring and $I$ a [[nilpotent ideal]]; the correspondence between formal groups and [[Lie algebras]] based on Hausdorff series is neatly developed and used in that language; see chapters 7--9 of

Kapranov introduced objects which should be interpreted as the infinitesimal neighborhoods of those commutative schemes with a closed immersion into a noncommutative scheme which is locally isomorphic to the spectrum of a free associative algebra.
