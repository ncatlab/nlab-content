A matrix $A$ over the field of [[real numbers]] is __totally positive__ (resp. __totally nonnegative__) if every minor (= determinant of any submatrix) is a positive (resp. nonnegative) real number. Total positivity implies a number of remarkable properties; for example all eigenvalues are distinct and positive. George Lusztig discovered that __total positivity__ is closely related to some phenomena in the theory of [[Lie groups]] and [[quantum groups]].
