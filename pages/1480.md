A part of his work has developed the ideas of  [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead's]] basic programme for [[algebraic homotopy]], using a mix of [[cofibration category|cofibration categories]] and categories with a particular type of [[cylinder functor]], that he calls [[I-category|I-categories]]. These are treated in separate entries. Baues has also systematically developed aspects of secondary homological algebra (secondary cohomological operations, secondary Steenrod algebra, secondary chain complexes, secondary triangualted category) which is a form of categorification of usual homlogical lagebra. He devloped them together with sound applications in the computations with Adams-Novikov spectral sequence and calculations of homotopy groups of spheres. He also developed the study of "cohomology of categories".
