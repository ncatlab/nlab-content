## Idea

The [[model structure on enriched categories]] gives in particular a model structure on dg-categories, called the _Dwyer-Kan model structure_, which is analogous to the usual [[model structure on sSet-categories]] which models [[(infinity,1)-categories]].

There are interesting [[left Bousfield localizations]] of this model structure, called the _quasi-equiconic_ and _Morita_ model structures.  Here the [[fibrant objects]] are the [[pretriangulated dg-categories]], resp. [[idempotent complete category|idempotent complete]] [[pretriangulated dg-categories]].  In characteristic zero, the Morita model structure is known to present the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of linear [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]] ([Cohn 13](#Cohn13)).

## Statement

### With Dwyer-Kan weak equivalences

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $k$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Write $dgCat_k$ for the [[category]] of [[small category|small]] [[dg-categories]] over $k$.

There is the structure of a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] on $dgCat_k$ where a dg-functor $F : A \to B$ is

* a weak equivalence if

  1. for all objects $x,y \in A$ the component $F_{x,y} : A(x,y) \to B(F(x), F(y))$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of [[chain complexes]];

  1. the induced functor on [[homotopy categories]] $H^0(F)$ (obtained by taking degree 0 [[chain homology]] in each hom-object)  is an [[equivalence of categories]].

* a fibration if

  1. for all objects  $x,y \in A$ the component $F_{x,y}$ is a degreewise surjection of chain complexes;

  1. for each [[isomorphism]] $F(x) \to Z$ in $H^0(B)$ there is a lift to an isomorphism in $H^0(A)$.

This is due to ([Tabuada](#Tabuada)).

###### Remark

The definition is entirely analogous to the [[model structure on sSet-categories]].   Both are special cases of the [[model structure on enriched categories]].

### With Morita equivalences
  {#WithMoritaEquivalences}

There is another model category structure with more weak equivalences, the _Morita equivalences_ ([Tabuada 05](#Tabuada05)).  This is in fact the [[left Bousfield localization]] of the above model structure with respect to the Morita equivalences, i.e. functors $F: C \to D$ whose induced [[restriction of scalars]] functor $\mathbf Lf^* : \mathbf D(D) \to \mathbf D(C)$ is an [[equivalence of categories]].

The [[fibrant objects]] with respect to this model structure are the [[dg-categories]] A for which the canonical inclusion $H^0(A) \hookrightarrow \mathbf D(A)$ has its [[essential image]] stable under [[cones]], [[suspensions]], and [[direct sums]].  Hence the [[homotopy category]] with respect to this model structure is identified with the [[full subcategory]] of Ho(DGCat), the homotopy category of the Dwyer-Kan model structure, spanned by dg-categories of this form.

This model structure is a presentation of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] ([Cohn 13](#Cohn13)).

The [[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated envelope]] of [[Bondal]]-[[Kapranov]] is a [[fibrant replacement]] functor for the Morita model structure.  The [[DG quotient]] of [[Drinfeld]] is a model for the [[homotopy cofibre]] with respect to the Morita model structure.
