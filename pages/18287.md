## Statement

Let $X$ be a $T_1$ [[topological space]].

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is a [[fully normal topological space]];

2. $X$ is a [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space]].

([Stone 48](#Stone48))

Since [[metric spaces are fully normal]] it follows as a corollary that [[metric spaces are paracompact]]. Accordingly, this statement is now also known as _Stone's theorem_.

Note that without a [[separation axiom]] such as $T_1$, the result fails to hold.  For example, any [[compact topological space]] is paracompact, and any [[fully normal topological space]] is [[normal topological space|normal]], so any non-normal compact space is a paracompact space that's not fully normal.

The [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] condition from statement 2 cannot be dropped, again because there are compact $T_1$ spaces that are not normal, such as an infinite set with the [[cofinite topology]].
