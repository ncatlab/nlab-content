## Idea

In [[differential topology]] the _connected sum_ of two [[manifolds]] equipped with a common [[submanifold]] is the result of gluing them along their [[boundaries]] of the [[tubular neighbourhoods]] of this submanifold.

Often this concept is considered by default for the case that the given submanifold is the [[point space]]. In this case the correspinding neighbourhoods are [[balls]] with [[boundary]] [[n-spheres]] along which the two manifolds are being glued.

###### Proposition
**([[Euler characteristic]] of [[connected sums]])**

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[closed manifolds]] ([[topological manifold|topological]] or [[differentiable manifold|differentiable]])  of [[even number|even]] [[dimension]]. Then the [[Euler characteristic]] of their [[connected sum]] is the [[sum]] of their separate [[Euler characteristics]], minus 2:

$$
  \chi
  \big(
    X \sharp Y 
  \big)
  \;=\;
  \chi
  \big(X\big)
  +
  \chi
  \big(Y\big)
  -2
$$
