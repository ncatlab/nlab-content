## Idea

In [[differential topology]] the _connected sum_ of two [[manifolds]] equipped with a common [[submanifold]] is the result of gluing them along their [[boundaries]] of the [[tubular neighbourhoods]] of this submanifold.

Often this concept is considered by default for the case that the given submanifold is the [[point space]]. In this case the correspinding neighbourhoods are [[balls]] with [[boundary]] [[n-spheres]] along which the two manifolds are being glued.
