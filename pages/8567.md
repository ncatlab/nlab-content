##Idea

The notion of _geometric point_ refers to a certain kind of [[morphism]] between [[schemes]] in [[algebraic geometry]].

While a [[point]] in a [[topological space]], $X$,  can be thought of as a [[continuous function]] from a singleton space to $X$, in [[algebraic geometry]] the 'spaces' come with more structure as they are [[schemes]] and singletons correspond to the [[prime spectrum|spectra]] of [[fields]].

## Definition

Suppose a scheme $S$ is defined over  a field $k$, so is equipped with a morphism to $Spec (k)$.

###### Definition

A **geometric point++ $\xi$ in $S$ is a [[morphism]] from $Spec(\overline{k}))$ to $S$ where $\overline{k}$ is an [[algebraic closure]] of $k$.

###### Remark

In general the set of geometric points of a scheme is different from the set of ordinary points of its underlying topological space.
