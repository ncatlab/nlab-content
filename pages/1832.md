A notion of model stack is an adaptation of model categories to stacks. [[Nikolai Durov]]
([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/math/abs/0704.2030)) has studied them in passing and noted that a more flexible notion for that context is a weaker notion of [[pseudomodel stack]] which he introduced there. 

A stack $C$ over a site $S$ is a __model stack__ if in every fiber three local classes of morphisms are distinguished: fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences (with terminology acyclic (co)fibration - (co)fibration which is also a weak equivalence) and

(MS1) all fiber categories are closed under small limits and colimits and all cartesian morphisms in $C$ admit left and right adjoints,

(MS2) each distinguished class is local and stable under global retracts,

(MS3) (2-out-of-3) If $f$, $g$, $g\circ f$ are defined morphisms ina  fixed fiber than if any two of the three are weak equivalences then so is the third,

(MS4) any cofibration has [[local left lifting property]] with respect to any acyclic fibration, and any acyclic fibration has local left lifting property with respect to any fibration, 

(MS5) (factorization) Any morphism can be globally factorized as a cofibration followed by a fibration, where one can choose any one of the two acyclic.
