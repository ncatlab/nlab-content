The notion of model stack is an adaptation of [[model categories]] to [[stacks]]. [[Nikolai Durov]] ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2030)) has studied them in passing and noted that a more flexible notion for that context is the weaker notion of [[pseudomodel stack]] which he introduced there. 

A [[stack]] $C$ over a [[site]] $S$ is a __model stack__ if in every fiber three local classes of morphisms are distinguished: fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences (with the terminology that an acyclic (co)fibration is a (co)fibration which is also a weak equivalence) and

(MS1) all fiber categories are [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]] and [[finitely cocomplete category|finitely cocomplete]] and all [[cartesian morphism]]s in $C$ admit [[left adjoint|left]] and [[right adjoint|right]] adjoints,

(MS2) each distinguished class is local and stable under global [[retracts]],

(MS3) (2-out-of-3) If $f$, $g$, $g\circ f$ are defined morphisms in a fixed fiber, then if any two of the three are weak equivalences then so is the third,

(MS4) any cofibration has the [[local left lifting property]] with respect to any acyclic fibration, and any acyclic fibration has the local left lifting property with respect to any fibration, 

(MS5) (factorization) Any morphism can be globally factored as a cofibration followed by a fibration, where one can choose either one of the two acyclic.
