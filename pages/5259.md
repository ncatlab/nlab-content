## Idea

The _spectral action_ is a natural [[functional]] on the space of [[spectral triples]]. It is essentially a regularized [[heat kernel]] expansion of the [[Dirac operator]]-like operator in the spectral triple.

Since a spectral triple encodes [[Riemannian geometry]] in a generalized context of [[noncommutative geometry]], a functional on a space of spectral triples is comparable to the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional on the space of ordinary Riemennian manifolds. And indeed, on spectral triples corresponding to ordinary Riemannian geometry the spectral action reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a series of integrals over higher [[curvature]] invariants. Moreover, by an incarnation of the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]], on spectral triples corresponding toa Riemannian manifold times a non-classical space of classical dimension 0, the spectral action to first order is an [[Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac theory]] and in fact [[Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory]], hence also includes [[gauge theory]] ([[Yang-Mills theory]]).


## Application to particle phenomenology

The spectral action has been proposed as an [[action functional]] for describing fundamental [[physics]] (the [[standard model of particle physics]]). See at 

* [[higher category theory and physics]] the section _[The standard model and gravity](higher+category+theory+and+physics#SpecStandModAndGravity)_.

Notice that a [[spectral triple]] which describes the [[worldline]] [[quantum mechanics]] of a point [[particle]] may be regarded as the point-particle degeneration limit of a [[2d SCFT]] (a "[[2-spectral triple]]", [Roggenkamp-Wendland 03](#RoggenkampWendland03), [Soibelman 11](#Soibelman11)) which describes the [[worldsheet]] [[quantum field theory]] of a [[superstring]]. It has been argued ([Chamseddine 97](#Chamseddine97)) that the spectral action of the spectral triple correspondingly reproduces that of the [[effective field theories]] of these [[string theories]].

### General On spectral triples

The notion of [[spectral triple]] and of spectral action was introduced in

* [[Alain Connes]], _Gravity coupled with matter and foundation of non-commutative geometry_ ([arXiv:hep-th/9603053](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9603053))

A discussion specifically of the spectral action is in

previous models of the [[standard model of particle physics]] were refined in some technical fine print, and it was found that the [[KO-dimension]] of the classically 0-dimensional compactification spaces has to be 6 (just as in [[superstring theory]]). Also a concise [[bimodule]]-characterization of the particle content of the standard model was claimed (prop. 2.2).
