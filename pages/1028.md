## Definition

### In category theory

An **equalizer** is a [[limit]] 

$$
\operatorname{eq}\underset{\quad e \quad}{\to}x\underoverset{\quad g \quad}{f}{\rightrightarrows}y
$$



over a parallel pair i.e. of the [[diagram]] of the shape 

$$
  \left\lbrace
      x \underoverset{\quad g \quad}{f}{\rightrightarrows} y
  \right\rbrace
  \,.
$$

(See also [[fork]] diagram).

This means that for $f : x \to y$ and $g : x \to y$ two [[parallel morphisms]] in a [[category]] $C$, their equalizer is, if it exists

* an object $eq(f,g) \in C$;

* a morphism $eq(f,g) \to x$

* such that 

  * pulled back to $eq(f,g)$ both morphisms become [[equality|equal]]: $ (eq(f,g) \to x \stackrel{f}{\to} y) = (eq(f,g) \to x \stackrel{g}{\to} y) $
  * and $eq(f,g)$ is the [[universal property|universal object]] with this property.

The dual concept is that of [[coequalizer]].

### In type theory

In [[type theory]] the [[equalizer]]

$$
  P \to A \stackrel{\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}} B
$$

is given by the [[dependent sum]] over the [[dependent type|dependent]] [[equality type]]

$$
  P \simeq \sum_{a : A} (f(a) = g(a))
  \,.
$$



## Examples

* In $C =$ [[Set]] the equalizer of two functions of sets is the subset of elements of $c$ on which both functions coincide.
$$
  eq(f,g)
  = 
  \left\{
     s \in c | 
     f(s) = g(s)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

* For $C$ a category with [[zero object]] the equalizer of a morphism $f : c \to d$ with the corresponding [[zero morphism]] is the [[kernel]] of $f$.


## Properties

###### Proposition

A category has equalizers if it has binary [[product]]s and [[pullback]]s.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $S \stackrel{\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}} T$ the given diagram, form the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     eq(f,g) &\to& S 
     \\
     \big\downarrow && \big\downarrow \mathrlap{(f, g)}
     \\
     T &\stackrel{(id, id)}{\to}&  T \times T
  }
  \,.
$$

One checks that the horizontal morphism $eq(f,g) \to S$ equalizes $f$ and $g$ and that it does so universally.

###### Proposition
If a category has equalizers and (finite) products, then it has (finite) [[limits]].

For the finite case, we may say equivalently:

###### Proposition
If a category has equalizers, binary products and a terminal object, then it has finite [[limits]].

\begin{prpn} Let $e: E \rightarrow X$ be an arrow in a category $\mathcal{C}$ which is an equaliser of a pair of arrows of $\mathcal{C}$. Then $e$ is a [[monomorphism]].
\end{prpn}

\begin{proof} If $g,h : A \rightarrow E$ are arrows of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $e \circ g = e \circ h$, then it follows immediately from the uniqueness part of the universal property of an equaliser that $g = h$. \end{proof}
