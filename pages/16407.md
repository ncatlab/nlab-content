## Definition

A **topological map** (or **embedded graph**) $M$ is a [[graph]] $G = (V,E,d)$ (loops and multiple edges allowed) equipped with an embedding $\theta$ of $G$ into a ([[connected space|connected]], [[oriented]], [[compact space|compact]] without [[boundary]]) [[surface]] $X$ in such a way that:

1. vertices $x \in V$ are represented as distinct points $\theta(x) \in X$;

2. edges $e \in E$ are represented as curves $\theta(e)$ on the surface $X$ that intersect only at the vertices;

3. the complement $X \setminus \theta(G)$ of the graph on the surface is a disjoint union of connected components, called _faces_, each [[homeomorphic]] to an open [[disk]] (in other words, each face is [[simply connected]]).

Note that the last condition implies that $G$ must be a connected graph (i.e., that there is a path between any pair of vertices).

Topological maps are always considered up to homeomorphism, and the **genus** of a map $M$ is defined as the [[genus of a surface|genus]] of the underlying surface $X$.

The conditions on the surface $X$ are standard, and lead to an elegant, purely combinatorial representation of topological maps up to homeomorphism as a triple (or a pair) of permutations satisfying a few properties, known as [[combinatorial maps]].  On the other hand, it is also possible to consider more general forms of topological maps on other kinds of surfaces (e.g., non-orientable ones), leading to different variations on the concept of combinatorial map.
