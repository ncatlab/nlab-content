## Definition

A **topological map** (or **embedded graph**) $M$ is a [[graph]] $G = (V,E,d)$ (loops and multiple edges allowed) equipped with an embedding $\theta$ of $G$ into a [[surface]] $X$ in such a way that:

1. vertices $x \in V$ are represented as distinct points $\theta(x) \in X$;

2. edges $e \in E$ are represented as curves $\theta(e)$ on the surface $X$ that intersect only at the vertices;

3. the complement $X \setminus \theta(G)$ of the graph on the surface is a disjoint union of connected components, called _faces_, each [[homeomorphic]] to an open [[disk]] (in other words, each face is [[simply connected]]).

These conditions can be summarized by saying that $\theta$ is a _cellular embedding_ (or "2-cell embedding").  Additionally, one may place several conditions on the underlying surface:

* $X$ is [[compact space|compact]]
* $X$ is [[connected space|connected]]
* $X$ is [[oriented]]
* $X$ is without [[boundary]]

Topological maps are always considered up to the appropriate notion of homeomorphism, and they inherit various properties of the underlying surface.  For example, a graph embedded in a connected surface is itself necessarily a connected graph, and one speaks of the _genus_ of a map as the [[genus of a surface|genus]] of the underlying surface $X$.

## Embedded graphs versus abstract graphs

It is important to distinguish topological maps, which are graphs equipped with an embedding, from graphs which may happen to have the property of being embeddable in different surfaces.  For example, a **planar map** is a graph equipped with a cellular embedding into the [[sphere]], while a **planar graph** is a graph which is _graph isomorphic_ to the underlying graph of a planar map.  Two planar graphs are considered equivalent if they are isomorphic as graphs $G_1 \cong G_2$, but two planar maps are only considered equivalent if this isomorphism of graphs can be realized on their embeddings $\theta_1(G_1) \cong \theta_2(G_2)$ by a homeomorphism of the sphere.  In particular, one planar graph might have multiple, inequivalent embeddings into the sphere.

To emphasize the distinction between embedded graphs and graphs which may happen to be embeddable, one sometimes refers to the latter as **abstract graphs**.[^Bartlett]

## Permutation representations

One of the remarkable properties of topological maps is that they can be given a purely algebraic representation as a collection of permutations satisfying a few properties.  For now, see the articles ([[cartographic group]]) and ([[combinatorial map]]).
