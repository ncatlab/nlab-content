## Idea
 {#Idea}

For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[topos]], then an [[essential subtopos]]  $\mathbf{H}_l \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ is called a _level_ of $\mathbf{H}$. This is equivalently the inclusion of the [[right adjoint]] of an [[adjoint cylinder]]/[[adjoint modality]].

The terminology is due to the fact ([Kelley-Lawvere 89](#KL89)) that the [[essential geometric morphism|essential]] [[subtoposes]] of a topos form a [[complete lattice]]. 

If for two levels $\mathbf{H}_{1} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_2$ the second one includes the [[modal types]] of the [[idempotent comonad]] of the first one, and if it is minimal with this property, then [[Lawvere]] speaks of "[[Aufhebung]]" (see there for details) of the [[unity of opposites]] exhibited by the first one.

## Examples

* For $\mathbf{H} = $ [[sSet]] the topos of [[simplicial sets]], then the tower of [[simplicial coskeleton|n-coskeleton]]-inclusions for all $n$ is a sequence of levels (the extra left adjoint exhibiting the essentialness being the [[simplicial skeleton]]). The [[Aufhebung]] in this example is discussed in detail in ([KRRZ 11](#KRRZ11)).


* The lowest level is the inclusion of the trivial subtopos as the [[terminal object]]. See also at _[[unity of opposites]]_ the section _[Werden](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+modality#Werden)_.

* A level above this is (if it exists) [[cohesion]] and a level above that is, if it exists, [[differential cohesion]].

  Here differential cohesion itself typically comes in a countable tower of levels, given by the $n$th order [[infinitesimal objects]], for each $n$.
