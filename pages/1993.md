A __butterfly__ or __papillon__ is a [[crossed profunctor]] between [[crossed module]]s such that the NE-SW sequence is exact i.e. a (nonabelian in general) group extension sequence. It corresponds to weak functors between the corresponding $2$-[[2-group|groups]]. A butterfly is flippable, or reversible, if both diagonals (cf. [[crossed profunctor]]) are extensions. There is also a straightforward generalization for $2$-group stacks.

In fact, under the correspondence crossed modules $\leftrightarrow$ categories internal to $Grp$, butterflies are precisely the saturated [[anafunctor|anafunctors]] internal to $Grp$, using the [[Grothendieck pretopology]] of surjective homomorphisms.
