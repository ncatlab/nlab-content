## Idea

An [[object]] $U$ (or family $\mathcal{U}$ of objects) in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is called a _separator_ or _generator_ if [[generalized elements]] with [[domain]] $U$ (or domain from $\mathcal{U}$) are sufficient to distinguish [[morphisms]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of a _[[coseparator]]_.


## Definitions

###### Definition

An [[object]] $U \in \mathcal{C}$ of a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is called a __separator__ or a __generator__ or a __separating object__ or a __generating object__ or is said to __separate morphisms__ if:
* for every pair of [[parallel morphisms]] $f,g \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, if
  * for every morphism $e\colon U \to X$,
  * $u \circ f = u \circ g$,
* then $f = g$.

Assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ is [[locally small|locally small category]], we have equivalently say that $U$ is a separator if the [[hom functor]] $Hom(U,-) \colon \mathcal{C} \to $ [[Set]] is [[faithful functor|faithful]].


More generally:

###### Definition

A [[family]] $\mathcal{U} = (U_a ;|; a\colon A)$ of [[objects]] of a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a __separating family__ or a __generating family__ if:
* for every pair of [[parallel morphisms]] $f,g \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, if
  * for every index $a$ and every morphism $e\colon U_a \to X$,
  * $u \circ f = u \circ g$,
* then $f = g$.
=--

Assuming again that $\mathcal{C}$ is [[locally small category|locally small]], we have equivalently say that $\mathcal{U}$ is a separating family if the family of [[hom functors]] $Hom(U_a,-) \colon \mathcal{C} \to $ [[Set]] is [[jointly faithful family of functors|jointly faithful]].

Since repetition is irrelevant in a separating family, we may also speak of a _separating [[class]]_ instead of a separating family.

###### Definition

A __separating set__ is a [[size issues|small]] separating class.

## Examples and applications

* In [[Set]], any [[inhabited set]] is a separator; in particular, the [[point]] is a separator.

*  More generally, in any [[well-pointed category]], any [[terminal object]] is a separator.  More generally still, in any represented [[concrete category]], the representing object is a separator.

* For $R$ a [[ring]], any [[free module]] on an inhabited set is a separator for the category $R$[[Mod]] of [[modules]] over $R$.
