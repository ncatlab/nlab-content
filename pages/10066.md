## Idea

The [[equivariant cohomology]] version of the [[generalized cohomology theory]] [[K-theory]]

e.g. _[[equivariant operator K-theory]]_, _[[equivariant KK-theory]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to operator K-theory of crossed product algebras

The _[[Green-Julg theorem]]_ identifies, under some conditions, equivariant K-theory with [[operator K-theory]] of corresponding [[crossed product algebras]].

### Relation to K-theory of homotopy quotient spaces (Borel constructions)

For $X$ a [[topological space]] equipped with a $G$-[[action]] for $G$ a [[topological group]], write $X//G$ for the [[homotopy type]] of the corresponding [[homotopy quotient]]. A standard model for this is the [[Borel construction]]

$$
  X//G \simeq (X \times EG)/G
  \,.
$$

The ordinary [[topological K-theory]] of $X//G$ is also called the _Borel-equivariant K-theory_ of $X$, denoted

$$
  K_G^{Bor}(X) \coloneqq K(X//G)
  \,.
$$

There is a canonical map

$$
  K_G(X) \to K_G^{Bor}(X)
$$

from the genuine equivariant K-theory to the Borel equivariant K-theory. In terms of the [[Borel construction]] this is given by the composite

$$
  K_G(X) \to K_G(X \times E G) \simeq K((X \times E G) / G ) \simeq K_G^{Bor}(X)
  \,,
$$

where the first map is pullback along the [[projection]] $X \times E G \to X$ and the first equivalence holds because the $G$-action on $X \times E G$ is free.

This map from genuine to Borel equivariant K-theory is not in general an isomorphism.

Specifically for $X$ the point, then $K_G(\ast) \simeq R(G)$ is the [[representation ring]] and $K_G^{Bor}(\ast) \simeq K(B G)$ is the [[topological K-theory]] of the [[classifying space]] $B G$ of $G$-[[principal bundles]]. In this case the above canonical map is of the form

$$
  R(G) \to K(B G)
  \,.
$$

This is never an [[isomorphism]], unless $G$ is the trivial group. But the [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]] says that the map identifies $K(B G)$ as the completion of $R(G)$ at the [[ideal]] of [[virtual representations]] of rank 0.

## Examples

The $G$-equivariant K-theory of the point for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] is the [[representation ring]] of $G$.
