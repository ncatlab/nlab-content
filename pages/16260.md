## Idea

In classical [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) the _positive energy theorem_ (formerly the _positive mass conjecture_) states that under reasonable assumptions ([[dominant energy condition]]) on the nature of the [[matter]] content (i.e. on the non-gravitational [[stress-energy tensor]]) then the [[ADM masss]] of any [[asymptotically flat spacetime]] solving the [[Einstein equations]] is non-negative, and zero precisely only for [[Minkowski spacetime]] (the [[vacuum]]).
