## Idea

The Baum-Connes conjecture asserts that under suitable technical conditions, the [[operator K-theory]]/[[KK-theory]] of the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of an [[action groupoid|action]] [[topological groupoid]] $X//G$ is equivalent to the _$G$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]]_ [[topological K-theory]]/[[operator K-theory]]/[[KK-theory]] of $X$. Moreover, it says that this equivalences is exhibited by the _[[analytic assembly map]]_.
(Just the [[injective map|injectivity]] of this map is related to the [[Novikov conjecture]].)

The original version of the Baum-Connes conjecture ([Baum-Connes](#BaumConnes00)) stated for a suitable [[topological group]] $G$ that with $X = E G \simeq \ast$ the point incarnated as the $G$-[[universal principal bundle]] with its free $G$-[[action]] the [[analytic assembly map]] (the $G$-equivariant [[index]] map)

$$
  K_\bullet^G(E G) \stackrel{}{\to} K_\bullet(C(\mathbf{B}G))
  \,,
$$

from the $G$-equivariant $K$-theory of $E G$ to the [[operator K-theory]] of the [[group algebra]], hence the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of the [[delooping]] groupoid $\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast // G$, is an [[isomorphism]].

This Baum-Connes conjecture is known to be true for

* [[compact topological groups]],
* [[abelian groups]],
* [[Lie groups]] with finitely many [[connected components]];
* $p$-adic groups,
*  adelic groups.

It is not known if the conjecture is true for all [[discrete groups]].

Later the statement was generalized ([Tu 99](#Tu99)) to more general groupoids. 


In ([Kasparov 88](#Kasparov88)) the refinement of the [[analytic assembly map]] to [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[KK-theory]] is given, and called the _descent map_. This is of the form (recalled as [Blackadar, theorem 20.6.2](#Blackadar))

$$
  KK^G(A,B) \to KK(G \ltimes A, G \ltimes B)
$$

where on the left we have $G$-equivariant KK-theory and on the right ordinary [[KK-theory]] of [[crossed product C*-algebras]] (which by the discussion there are models for the [[groupoid convolution algebras]] of $G$-[[action groupoids]]).

This is an [[isomorphism]] at least for $G$ a [[compact topological group]] and restricted to [[operator K-theory]] (hence to the first argument being $\mathbb{C}$) and for $G$ a [[discrete group]] and restricted to [[K-homology]] (hence ot the second argument being $\mathbb{C}$). In this form this is the **Green-Julg theorem**, see [below](#GreenJulgTheorem).

###### Theorem
**(Green-Julg theorem)**

Let $G$ be a [[topological group]] acting on a [[C*-algebra]] $A$.

1. If $G$ is a [[compact topological group]] then the descent map

   $$
     KK^G(\mathbb{C}, A) \to KK(\mathbb{C},G\ltimes A) 
   $$

   is an [[isomorphism]], identifying the equivariant [[operator K-theory]] of $A$ with the ordinary [[operator K-theory]] of the [[crossed product C*-algebra]] $G \ltimes A$.

1. if $G$ is a [[discrete group]] then the descent map

   $$
     KK^G(A, \mathbb{C}) \to KK(G \ltimes A, \mathbb{C})
   $$

   is an [[isomorphism]], identifying the equivariant [[K-homology]] of $A$ with the ordinary [[K-homology]] of the [[crossed product C*-algebra]] $G \ltimes A$.
