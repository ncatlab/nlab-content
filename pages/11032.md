## Idea

The concept of _traced monoidal category_ axiomatizes the structure on a [[monoidal category]] for it to have a sensible notion of [[trace]] the way it exists canonically in [[compact closed categories]].

## Properties

### Relation to compact closed catgeories
 {#RelationToCompactClosedCategories}

Given a traced monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, there is a [[free construction]] completion of it to a [[compact closed category]] $Int(\mathcal{C})$ ([Joyal-Street-Verity 96](#JoyalStreetVerity96)):

the objects of $Int(\mathcal{C})$ are pairs $(A^+, A^-)$ of objects of $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ in $Int(\mathcal{C})$ is given by a morphism of the form $A^+\otimes B^- \longrightarrow A^- \otimes B^+$ in $\mathcal{C}$, and [[composition]] of two such morphisms $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ and $(B^+ , B^-) \to (C^+ , C^-)$ is given by [[trace|tracing out]] $B^+$ and $B^-$ in the evident way.



### Categorical semantics

Traced monoidal categories serve as an "operational" [[categorical semantics]] for [[linear logic]], known as _[[Geometry of Interactions]]_. See there for more.

In this context the free compact closure $Int(\mathcal{C})$ from [above](RelationToCompactClosedCategories) is sometimes called the _Geometry of Interaction construction_ and denoted $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{C})$ ([Abramsky-Haghverdi-Scott 02, def. 2.6](AbramskyHaghverdiScott02)).
