## Idea

A **covering space** (or **wrapping space**) is a [[bundle]] $p: E \to B$ in which is locally trivial and with [[discrete space|discrete]] fiber. 


## Definition

In [[topology]], for $B$ a [[topological space]]

then a [[continuous function]] $p: E \to B$ is a covering space over $B$ if for each point $x \in B$, there exists an [[open neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ which is **evenly covered** by $p$ in that the [[pullback]] of $p$ over $U$ is isomorphic to a product bundle with discrete fiber $E_x = p^{-1}(x)$: 

$$\array{
U \times E_x & \cong & p^{-1}(U) & \to & E\\
& \pi \searrow & \downarrow & & \downarrow p\\
& & U & \hookrightarrow & B
}$$

(the square is a pullback and the isomorphism maps $(x, e \in E_x) \mapsto e$). 

Covering spaces over $B$ form an evident [[full subcategory]] $Cov/B \hookrightarrow Top/B$ of the [[slice category]] of [[Top]] over $B$. These can be put together to form a [[replete subcategory|replete]], [[wide subcategory|wide]] subcategory $Cov$ of $Top$, so that $Cov/B$ is an [[over category]], just as the notation suggests.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Different points in $B$ may have non-isomorphic fibers. However, if open sets $U$ and $V$ are evenly covered by $p: E \to B$ and have nonempty intersection, then there are canonical identifications 
$$E_x \cong E_z \cong E_y$$ 
between typical fibers over $x \in U$, $y \in V$, and $z \in U \cap V$. If $B$ is path-connected, then all the fibers match up to isomorphism (by the unique path-lifting lemma; see below). 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Fibers of a covering space may be empty. Some authors choose to forbid that, adding the condition that $p$ be a surjection, but the resulting category of covering projections over a space $B$ is not as nice as it would be without that condition. 


=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The terms "covering space" and "covering projection", while traditional, are certainly not optimal: they mislead by being too close to (open) "[[cover|coverings]]". [[James Dolan]] has suggested "wrapping space" as an alternative (as in the image of thread wrapping around a spool, to evoke the archetypal example of a covering projection, $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1: x \mapsto \exp(i x)$). 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is a generalizatin to "semi-coverings" ([Brazas12](#Brazas12)). Semicoverings satisfy the "[[2 out of 3]] rule". I.e,, if $f=g h$ and two of $f,g,h$ are semicoverings , then so is the third. This is not true for covering maps.

## Properties

### Basic properties
 {#BasicProperties}

+-- {: .num_prop #CoveringProjectionsAreOpenMaps}
###### Proposition
**(covering projections are [[open maps]])**

If $p \colon E \to X$ is a covering space projection, then $p$ is an [[open map]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of covering space there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ and [[homeomorphisms]] $p^{-1}(U_i) \simeq U_i \times Disc(F_i)$ for all $i \in I$. Since the [[projections]] out of a [[product topological space]] are [[open maps]] ([this prop.](product+topological+space#ProjectionsAreOpenMaps)), it follows that $p$ is an open map when restricted to any of the $p^{-1}(U_i)$. But a general open subset $W \subset E$ is the union of its restrictions to these subspaces:

$$
  W = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} (W \cap p^{-1}(U_i))
  \,.
$$

Since images preserve unions ([this prop.](interactions+of+images+and+pre-images+with+unions+and+intersections#PreservationOfUnionsAndIntersectionsOfSets)) it follows that 

$$
  p(W) = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} p(W \cap p^{-1}(U_i))
$$

is a union of open sets, and hence itself open.

=--


### Relation to étale spaces

Every covering space (even in the more general sense not requiring any connectedness axiom) is an [[etale space]], but not vice versa: 

* for a covering space the inverse image of some open set in the base $B$ needs to be, by the definition, a disjoint union of homeomorphic open sets in $E$; however the 'size' of the neighborhoods over various $e$ in the same stalk required in the definition of étalé space may differ, hence the intersection of their projections does not need to be an open set, if there are infinitely many points in the stalk.

* even if the the stalks of the etale space are finite, it need not be locally trivial. For instance the disjoint union $\coprod_i Ui$ of a collecton of open subsets of a space $X$ with the obvious projection $(\coprod_i U_i) \to X$ is etale, but does not have a typical fiber: the fiber over a given point has cardinality the number of open sets $U_i$ that contain this particular point.


### Lifting properties
 {#LiftingProperties}

We discuss [[left lifting properties]] satisfied by covering spaces.

1. [path-lifting property](#CoveringSpacePathLifting),

1. [homotopy-lifting propery](#CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting),

1. the [lifting theorem](#TheTheoremLifting).

+-- {: .num_lemma #CoveringSpacePathLifting}
###### Lemma
**(path lifting property)**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be any [[covering space]].  Given 

1. $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ a [[path]] in $X$, 

1. $\hat x_0 \in E$ be a lift of its starting point, hence such that $p(\hat x_0) = \gamma(0)$

then there exists a unique path $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to E$ such that

1. it is a lift of the original path: $p \circ \hat \gamma = \gamma$;

1. it starts at the given lifted point: $\hat \gamma(0) = \hat x_0$.

In other words, every [[commuting diagram]] in [[Top]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

has a unique [[lift]]:

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\hat \gamma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the case that the covering space is trival, hence of the [[Cartesian product]] form 

$$
  pr_1 \;\colon\;  X \times Disc(S) \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[product topological spaces]] 
in this case a lift $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to X \times Disc(S)$ is equivalently a [[pair]] of continuous functions

$$
  pr_1(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to X  \phantom{AAAA} pr_2(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to Disc(S)
  \,,
$$

Now the lifting condition explicitly fixes $pr_1(\hat \gamma) = \gamma$. Moreover, a continuous function into a [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$ is [[locally constant function|locally constant]], and since $[0,1]$ is a [[connected topological space]] this means that $pr_2(\hat \gamma)$ is in fact a [[constant function]] ([this example](connected+space#LocallyConstantFunctionsOnConnectedSpaces)), hence uniquely fixed to be $pr_2(\hat \gamma) = \hat x_0$.

This shows the statement for the case of trivial covering spaces.

Now consider any covering space $p \colon E \to X$. By definition of covering spaces, there exists for every point $x \in X$ a [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ such that the restriction of $E$ to $U_x$ becomes a trivial covering space:

$$
  p^{-1}(U_x) \simeq U_x \times Disc(p^{-1}(x))
  \,.
$$

Consider such a choice 

$$
  \{U_x \subset X\}_{x \in X}
  \,.
$$

This is an [[open cover]] of $X$. Accordingly, the [[pre-images]]

$$
  \left\{
    \gamma^{-1}(U_x)
    \subset 
    [0,1]
  \right\}_{x \in X}
$$

constitute an open cover of the [[topological interval]] $[0,1]$. 

Now $[0,1]$ is a [[sequentially compact topological space|compact]] [[metric space]] and therefore the [[Lebesgue number lemma]] implies that there is a [[positive number]] $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ and cover of $[0,1]$ by [[open intervals]] of the form $(-\epsilon + x , x  + \epsilon) \cap [0,1] \subset [0,1]$ which [[refinement|refines]] this cover. Again since $[0,1]$ is a [[compact topological space]] there is a [[finite set]] of such intervals which covers $[0,1]$. This means that we find a [[finite number]] of points 

$$
  t_0 \lt t_1 \lt \cdots \lt_{n+1} \in [0,1]
$$ 

with $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{n+1} = 1$ such that for all $0 \lt j \leg n$ there is $x_j \in X$ such that the corresponding path segment

$$
  \gamma([t_j, t_{j+1}]) \subset X
$$

is contained in $U_{x_j}$ from above. 

Now assume that $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_j]}$ has been found. Then by the triviality of the covering space over $U_{x_j}$ and the first argument above, there is a unique lift of $\gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ to a continuous function $\hat \gamma|_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ with starting point $\hat \gamma(t_j)$. Since $[0,t_{j+1}]$ is the [[pushout]] $[0,t_j] \underset{\{t_j\}}{\sqcup} [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ ([this example](Top#TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself)), it follows that $\hat \gamma|_{[0,t_j]}$ and $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ uniquely glue to a continuous function $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$ which lifts $\gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$.

By [[induction]] over $j$, this yields the required lift $\hat \gamma$.

Conversely, given any lift, $\hat \gamma$, then its restrictions $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ are uniquely fixed by the above inductive argument. Therefore also the total lift is unique.

###### Proposition
**([[homotopy lifting property]] of [[covering spaces]])**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be a [[covering space]]. Then given a [[homotopy]] relative the starting point between two [[paths]] in $X$, there is for every lift of these two paths to paths in $E$ with the same starting point a unique homotopy between the lifted paths that lifts the given homotopy:

For [[commuting squares]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} \times \{0,1\} &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\ 
    [0,1] \times \{0,1\}
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{}}\downarrow 
      &{}^{\mathllap{\hat \eta}}\nearrow& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] \times [0,1] &\underset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

there is a unique diagonal [[lift]] in the lower diagram, as shown.

Moreover if the homotopy $\eta$ also fixes the endpoint, then so does the lifted homotopy $\hat \eta$.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is analogous to that of lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}: The [[Lebesgue number lemma]] gives a partition of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ into a [[finite number]] of squares such that the image of each under $\gamma$ lands in an open subset over which the covering space trivializes. Then there is [[induction|inductively]] a unique appropriate lift over each of these squares.

Finally, if the homotopy in $X$ is constant also at the endpoint, hence on $\{1\} \times [0,1]$, then the function constant on $\hat \eta(1,1)$ is clearly a lift of the path $eta\vert_{\{1\}\times [0,1]}$ and by uniqueness of the path lifting (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) this means that also $\hat \eta$ is constant on $\{1\} \times [0,1]$.

###### Example


Let $(E,e) \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} (X,x)$ be a [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[covering space]]
and let $f \colon (Y,y) \longrightarrow (X,x)$ be a point-preserving [[continuous function]] such that the image of the [[fundamental group]] of $(Y,y)$ is contained within the image of the fundamental group of $(E,e)$ in that of $(X,x)$:

$$
  f_\ast(\pi_1(Y,y)) \subset p_\ast(\pi_1(E,e))
  \phantom{AA}
  \subset 
  \pi_1(X,x)
  \,.
$$

Then for $\ell_Y$ a [[path]] in $(Y,y)$ that happens to be a [[loop]], every lift of its image path $f \circ \ell$ in $(X,x)$ to a path $\widehat{f\circ \ell_Y}$ in $(E,e)$ is also a loop there.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption, there is a loop $\ell_E$ in $(E,e)$ and a homotopy fixing the endpoints of the form

$$
  \eta_{X} \;\colon\; p \circ \ell_E \Rightarrow f\circ \ell_Y
  \,.
$$

Then by the homotopy lifting property (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting}), there is a homotopy in $(E,e)$ fixing the starting point, of the form

$$
  \eta_{E} \;\colon\; \ell_E \Rightarrow \widehat{f \circ \ell_Y}
$$

and lifting the homotopy $\eta_X$. Since $\eta_X$ in addition fixes the endpoint, the uniqueness of the path lifting (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) implies that also $\eta_{E}$ fixes the endpoint. Therefore $\eta_E$ is in fact a homotopy between loops, and so $\weidehat{f \circ \ell_Y}$ is indeed a loop.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #TheTheoremLifting}
###### Proposition
**(lifting theorem)**

Let 

1. $p \colon E \to X$ be a [[covering space]];

1. $e \in E$ a point, with $x \coloneqq p(e)$ denoting its image,

1. $Y$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] and [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] [[topological space]];

1. $y \in Y$ a point

1. $f \colon (Y,y) \longrightarrow (X,x)$ a [[continuous function]] such that $f(y) = x$.

Then the following are equivalent:

1. There exists a lift $\hat f$ in the diagram

   $$
     \array{
       && (E,e)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\hat f}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
       \\
       (Y,y) &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (X,x)
     }
   $$

   of [[pointed topological spaces]].

1. The [[image]] of the [[fundamental group]] of $Y$ under $f$ in that of $X$ is contained in the image of the fundamental group of $E$ under $p$:

   $$
     f_\ast(\pi_1(Y,y)) \subset p_\ast( \pi_1(E,e) )
     \,
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The implication $1) \Rightarrow 2)$ is immediate. We need to show that the second statement already implies the first.

Since $Y$ is connected and locally path-connected, it is also a [[path-connected topological space]] ([this prop.](locally+path-connected+space#ForLocallyPathConnectedTheConnectedComponentsCoincideWithThePathConnectedComponents)). Hence for every point $y' \in Y$ there exists a [[path]] $\gamma$ connecting $y$ with $y'$ and hence a path $f \circ \gamma$ connecting $x$ with $f(y')$.  By the path-lifting property (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) this has a unique lift

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{e}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\widehat{f \circ \gamma}}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1]
     &\underset{f \circ \gamma}{\longrightarrow}&
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore

$$
  \hat f(y') \coloneqq \widehat{f \circ \gamma}
$$

if a lift of $f(y')$.

We claim now that this pointwise construction is independent of the choice $\gamma$, and hat as a function of $y'$ it is indeed continuous. This will prove the claim.

Now by the path lifting lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting} the lift $\widehat{\f \circ \gamma}$ is unique given $f \circ \gamma$, and hence $\hat f(y')$ depends at most on the choice of $\gamma$.

Hence let $\gamma' \colon [0,1] \to Y$ be another path in $Y$ that connects $y$ with $y'$. We need to show that then $\widehat{f \circ \gamma'} = \widehat{f \circ \gamma}$.

First observe that if $\gamma'$ is related to $\gamma$ by a [[homotopy]], so that then also $f \circ \gamma'$ is related to $f \circ \gamma$ by a homotopy, then this is the statement of the homotopy lifting property of lemma \ref{CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting}.

Next write $\bar\gamma'\cdot \gamma$ for the [[path concatenation]] of the path $\gamma$ with the [[reverse path]] of the path $\gamma'$, hence a loop in $Y$, so that $f \circ (\bar\gamma'\cdot \gamma)$ is a loop in $X$. The assumption that $f_\ast(\pi_1(Y,y)) \subset p_\ast(\pi_1(E,e))$ implies (example \ref{IfFundamentalGroupsIncludeThenfLoopsLiftToLoops}) that the path $\widehat{f \circ (\bar \gamma' \cdot \gamma)}$ which lifts this loop to $E$ is itself a loop in $E$.

By uniqueness of path lifting, this means that the lift of $f \circ ( \gamma' \cdot (\bar\gamma' \cdot \gamma) )$ coincides with that of $f \circ \gamma'$. But $\bar \gamma' \cdot (\gamma' \cdot \gamma)$ is homotopic (via reparameterization) to just $\gamma$. Hence it follows now with the first statement that the lift of $f \circ \gamma'$ indeed coincides with that of $f \circ \gamma$.

This shows that the above prescription for $\hat f$ is well defined. 

It only remains to show that the function $\hat f$ obtained this way is continuous.

Let $y' \in Y$ be a point and $W_{\hat f(y')} \subset E$ an open neighbourhood of its image in $E$. It is sufficient to see that there is an open neighbourhood $V_{y'} \subset Y$ such that $\hat f(V_y) \subset W_{\hat f(y')}$. 

Let $U_{f(y')} \subset X$ be an open neighbourhood over which $p$ trivializes. Then the restriction

$$
  p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')} 
    \;\subset\; 
  U_{f(y')} \times Disc(p^{-1}(f(y')))
$$ 

is an open subset of the product space. Consider its further restriction 

$$
  \left( U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\} \right)
    \cap 
  \left( 
    p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
  \right) 
$$

to the [[leaf]] 

$$
  U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\} \;\subset\; U_{f(y')} \times p^{-1}(f(y'))
$$

which is itself an open subset. Since $p$ is an [[open map]] ([this prop.](covering+space#CoveringProjectionsAreOpenMaps)), the subset 

$$
  p\left(
    \left(
      U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}
    \right)
      \cap 
    \left( 
      p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
    \right) 
  \right)
  \subset X
$$

is open, hence so is its pre-image

$$
  f^{-1}
  \left(
    p
      \left(
        \left(
          U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}
        \right)
          \cap 
        \left( 
          p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
        \right) 
    \right)
  \right)
    \;\subset\; 
  Y
  \,.
$$


Since $Y$ is assumed to be [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]], there exists a path-connected open neighbourhood

$$
  V_{y'}
    \subset 
  f^{-1}\left(p\left(
    \left(U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}\right)
      \cap 
    \left( 
      p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
    \right) 
  \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

By the uniqueness of pah lifting, the image of that under $\hat f$ is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat f(V_{y_'}) 
    & = 
    f(V_{y'}) \times \{\hat f(y')\}

### Fundamental theorem of covering spaces
 {#FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}

The connection between covering spaces over $B$ and the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(B)$ (for $B$ a [[connected space]]) is very old and runs very deep. An updated account involves shifting attention to [[representation]]s of the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(B)$ (regardless of connectedness); we give a brief outline of the theory here. 

Under some technical topological assumptions on the space $B$, the fundamental theorem can be stated thus: 

+-- {: .num_theorem #FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}
###### Theorem
**([[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]])**

Let $B$ be a [[topological space]] which is 

1. [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] 

1. [[semi-locally simply-connected space|semi-locally simply-connected]].

Then the category $Cov/B$ of covering spaces over $B$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of functors $\Pi_1(B) \to Set$ from the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $B$ to [[Set]] ([[permutation representation]]). 

This equivalence is exhibited by a [[functor]]

$$Fiber: Cov/B \to Set^{\Pi_1(B)},$$ 

sending a covering space $p: E \to B$ to the functor which maps the object $b \in \Pi_1(B)$ to the fiber $E_b = p^{-1}(b)$. 

Given a map $[\phi]: b \to c$ in $\Pi_1(B)$, where $\phi$ is a path from $b$ to $c$, the **unique path-lifting lemma** says that for any $e \in E_b$, there exists a unique fill-in $\tilde{\phi}: I \to E$, that is the diagonal arrow making the following diagram commute:

$$\array{
\{0\} & \stackrel{e}{\to} & E\\
i \downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow p \\ 
I & \overset{\phi}{\to} & B
}$$ 

and we define $Fiber([\phi]): E_b \to E_c$ as the map sending $e \in E_b$ to $\tilde{\phi}(1) \in E_c$. 

=--

(e.g [Møller 11, theorem 7.8](#Moller11))

In fact, in the proof of this theorem one establishes an [[adjoint equivalence]]: one constructs a [[left adjoint]] to $Fiber$,  

$$Set^{\Pi_1(B)} \to Cov/B,$$ 

via a [[tensor product]] or [[weighted colimit]] construction, namely the one that extends (by [[left Kan extension]] along the [[Yoneda embedding]] on $\Pi_1(B)^{op}$) the functor 

$$\Pi_1(B)^{op} \to Cov/B$$ 


that sends each object $b$ of $\Pi_1(B)$ to a universal covering space $\tilde{B}_b$ over the path-component of $b$. 

We now spell out the details. 



### Reconstructing covering spaces from monodromy

The [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]] (prop. \ref{FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}) claims that, under suitable conditions, the fiber-functor

$$
  Fib \;\colon\; Cov_{/B} \longrightarrow Set^{\Pi_1(B)}
$$

is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]]. Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], then this is equivalent to there being a functor the other way around

$$
  Rec \;\colon\; Set^{\Pi_1(B)} \longrightarrow Cov_{/B}
$$

which is an [[inverse]] to $Fib$, up to [[natural isomorphism]]. We may think of this is _reconstructing_ a covering space from its [[monodromy]].

### Universal covering space in terms of homotopy fibers {#HomotopyFibs}

We want to describe here how the universal covering space of $X$ is the [[homotopy fiber]] of the canonical morphism $X \to \Pi_1(X)$, hence the $\Pi_1(X)$-[[principal bundle]] classified by this [[cocycle]].

We place ourselves in the context of [[topological ∞-groupoid]]s and regard both the space $X$ as well as its [[schreiber:path ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ and its truncation to the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ as objects in there.

The canonical morphism $X \to \Pi(X)$ hence $X \to \Pi_1(X)$ given by the inclusion of contant paths may be regarded as a [[cocycle]] for a $\Pi(X)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]], respectively for a $\Pi_1(X)$-principal bundle.

Let $\pi_0(X)$ be the set of connected components of $X$, regarded as a topological $\infty$-groupoid, and choose any [[section]]  $\pi_0(X) \to \Pi(X)$ of the projection $\Pi(X) \to \pi_0(X)$.

Then the $\Pi(X)$-principal $\infty$-bundle classified by the [[cocycle]] $X \to \Pi(X)$ is its [[homotopy fiber]], i.e. the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    UCov(X) &\to& \pi_0(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

We think of this topological $\infty$-groupoid $UCov(X)$ as the **universal covering $\infty$-groupoid** of $X$. To break this down, we check that its [[decategorification]] gives the ordinary universal covering space: 

for this we compute the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    UCov_1(X) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi_1(X)
  }
  \,,
$$

where we assume $X$ to be connected with chosen baspoint $x$ just to shorten the exposition a little. By the laws of [[homotopy pullback]]s in general and [[homotopy fiber]]s in particular, we may compute this as the ordinary [[pullback]] of a weakly equivalent diagram, where the point $*$ is resolved to the [[generalized universal bundle|universal]] $\Pi_1(X)$-principal bundle

$$
  \mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X) = T_x \Pi_1(X)
  \,.
$$

> (More in detail, what we do behind the scenes is this: we regard the diagram as a diagram in the _global_ [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on [[Top]]. In there all our topological groupoids are fibrant, hence all we have to ensure is that one of the morphisms of the diagram becomes a fibration, which is what the passage to $\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)$ achieves. Then the ordinary pullback in the category of simplicial presheaves is the homotopy pullback in $\infty$-prestacks. Then by left exactness of $\infty$-stackification, the image of that in $\infty$-stacks is still a homotopy pullback. )

The topological groupoid $\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)$ has as objects homotopy classes rel endpoints of paths in $X$  starting at $x$ and as morphisms $\kappa : \gamma \to \gamma'$ it has commuting triangles

$$
  \array{
    && x
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\gamma}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma'}}
    \\
    y &&\stackrel{\kappa}{\to}&& y'
  }
$$

in $\Pi_1(X)$. The topology on this can be deduced from thinking of this as the [[pullback]]


$$
  \array{
   \mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X) &\to& {*}
   \\
   \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
   \\
   \Pi_1(X)^I &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}& \Pi_1(X)
  }
$$

in simplicial presheaves on [[Top]]. Unwinding what this means we find that the open sets in $Mor(\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X))$ are those where the endpoint evaluation produces an open set in $X$.

Now it is immediate to read off the homotopy pullback as the ordinary pullback

$$
  \array{
    UCov_1(X) &\to& \mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& \Pi_1(X)
    \,.
  }
$$

Since $X$ is categorically discrete, this simply produces the space of objects of $\mathbf{E}_x \Pi_1(X)$ over the points of $X$, which is just the space of all paths in $X$ starting at $x$ with the projection $UCov_1(X) \to X$ being endpoint evaluation. 

This indeed is then the usual construction of the universal covering space in terms of paths, as described for instance in  ([Dahlke](#Dahlke))
