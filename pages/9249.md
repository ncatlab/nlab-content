## Idea

The _Beilinson-Drinfeld operad_ is the [[operad]] whose [[algebras over an operad]] are [[BD algebras]].

See at _[[relation between BV and BD]]_.

## Definition

The underlying graded vector spaces are

$$
  BD \coloneqq P_0 \otimes \mathbb{R}[ [\hbar] ]
$$

and the [[differential]] is

$$
  d ( (-)\cdots (-))
  = 
  \hbar \{-,-\}
  \,.
$$
