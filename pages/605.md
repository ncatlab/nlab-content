## Idea

A [[manifold]] with boundary is a _cobordism_ between its boundary components.  But each component must be designated as a source or target component, so the entire cobordism may be seen as a [[morphism]] from a [[source]] manifold to a [[target]] manifold.

Dual to a cobordism is a [[bordism]].

See [[extended cobordism]] and [[cobordism category]] for more.
