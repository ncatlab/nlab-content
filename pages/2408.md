He was student of [[Yuri Manin]] at Moscow; his main specialty is algebraic geometry, including applications to arithmetic, [[automorphic form]]s, [[representation theory]] and mathematical physics. His famous discoveries and new concepts Drinfel'd modular varieties, Drinfel'd shtukas (Drinfel'd elliptic modules), ADHM-construction of instantons, Drinfel'd-Sokolov reduction in the theory of integrable systems, algebraic approach to quantum inverse scattering method in [[integrable systems]], and related subject of quantum groups including Yangians and quasi-Hopf algebras, geometric Langlands program, chiral algebras (with A. Beilinson), certain category of infinite-dimensional bundles in algebraic geometry (now sometimes called Drinfel'd bundles), and the general construction of quotient [[dg-categories]] in [[homological algebra]]. His ideas also influenced the beginnings of the new subject of [[derived algebraic geometry]].
