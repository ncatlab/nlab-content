###### Definition
**(locally finite cover)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]].

An [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ is called  _locally finite_ if for all points $x \in X$, there exists a  [[neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ such that it [[intersection|intersects]] only finitely many elements of the cover, hence such that  $U_x \cap U_i \neq \emptyset$ for only a [[finite number]] of $i \in I$.

## Properties

Any open cover defined by a (generalized) [[partition of unity]] has a locally finite shrinking.
