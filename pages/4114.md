## Idea

A _locally finite cover_ is a [[cover]] which in a suitable sense looks _locally_ like a [[finite cover]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition
**(locally finite cover)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]].

A [[cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ is called  _locally finite_ 
if it is a [[locally finite set of subsets]], hence
if for all points $x \in X$, there exists a  [[neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ such that it [[intersection|intersects]] only [[finite number|finitely many]] elements of the cover, hence such that  $U_x \cap U_i \neq \emptyset$ for only a [[finite number]] of $i \in I$.

If $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is an [[open cover]], then it is called a _locally finite open cover_.

## Properties


The following says that if there exists a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[refinement]] of a cover, then in fact there exists one with the same index set as the original cover.

###### Lemma
**(locally finite refinement induces locally finite cover with original index set)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]], and let $(\phi \colon J \to I, \{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J})$, be a [[refinement]] to a [[locally finite cover]].

Then  $\left\{ W_i \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ with 

$$
  W_i 
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    \underset{j \in \phi^{-1}(\{i\})}{\cup} V_j
  \right\}
$$

is still a [[refinement]] of $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ to a locally finite cover.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear by construction that $W_i \subset U_i$, hence that we have a [[refinement]]. We need to show local finiteness.

Hence consider $x \in X$. By the assumption that $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ is locally finite, it follows that there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and a [[finite set|finitee]] [[subset]] $K \subset J$ such that 

$$
  \underset{j \in J\backslash K}{\forall} \left( U_x \cap V_j = \emptyset \right)
  \,.
$$

Hence by construction 

$$
  \underset{I \in I\backslash \phi(K)}{\forall} \left( U_x \cap W_i = \emptyset \right)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[image]] $\phi(K) \subset I$ is still a [[finite set]], this shows that $\{W_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is locally finite.

###### Lemma
**([[shrinking lemma]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]], and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[open cover]]. Then there exists a shrinking to a locally finite open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ whose [[topological closure|closures]] $Cl(-)$ are still contained in the original cover:

$$
  V_i \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i
  \,.
$$
