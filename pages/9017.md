## Idea

Kadeishvili's theorem says that every [[A-∞-algebra]] (in [[chain complexes]]) is equivalent, as an $A_\infty$-algebra, to its [[cohomology]] ring.
  

## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem #KadeishviliTheorem}
###### Theorem

Let $A$ be an [[A-∞-algebra]] in [[chain complexes]] and let $H^\bullet(A)$ be the [[cohomology]] ring of $A$. There is an $A_\infty$-algebra structure on $H^\bullet(A)$ with $m_1 = 0$ and $m_2$ induced by the multiplication on $A$, constructed from the $A_\infty$-structure of $A$, such that there
is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of $A_\infty$-algebras $H^\bullet(A) \to A$ lifting the identity of $H^\bullet(A)$. This $A_\infty$-algebra structure on $H^\bullet(A)$ is unique up to quasi-isomorphism.

This is due to ([Kadeishvili](#Kadeishvili)). A clear English exposition with applications to Kähler manifolds is in ([Merkulov](#Merkulov)).

###### Proposition

The $A_\infty$-brackets on $H^\bullet(A)$ by theorem \ref{KadeishviliTheorem} are up to a sign equal to the [[Massey products]] on cohomology, whenever the latter are defined.
