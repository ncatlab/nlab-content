## Overview

The usual notion of [[Lambda-ring]] is directly related to the Banach ring
$(\mathbb{Z},|\cdot|_0)$ of integers equipped with their trivial norm in
the following way: a [[Lambda-ring]] is a usual ring equipped with
an action of the monoid $\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}-\{0\}/\{\pm 1\}$.
Remark that some important Lambda-rings, such as K-theory, are
actually equipped with an additional $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading,
that may be combined with the Lambda-structure to get an action
of the full monoid $\mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$. It is important to remark here
that the $\Lambda$-structure on $K$-theory allows to get back
(as the spectrum of the Lambda-operations) the full $\Z$-grading
on Betti cohomology.

If one thinks of Lambda-structures
as related to the Banach ring of integers with their trivial norm,
one may seek for various generalizations, that will be called
"generalized Lambda-structure", associated to more general Banach rings.

## Definition

Let $(R,|\cdot|)$ be an integral Banach ring equipped with a multiplicative norm.
We will denote $\Lambda(R,|\cdot|)$ the monoid given by
$$\Lambda(R,|\cdot|):=\mathrm{Frac}(R)\cap \{a\in R,\;|a|\leq 1\}.$$
