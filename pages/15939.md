## Overview

The usual notion of [[Lambda-ring]] is directly related to the Banach ring
$(\mathbb{Z},|\cdot|_0)$ of integers equipped with their trivial norm in
the following way: a [[Lambda-ring]] is a usual ring equipped with
an action of the monoid $\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}$-$\{0\}/\{\pm 1\}$.
Remark that some important Lambda-rings, such as K-theory, are
actually equipped with an additional $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading,
that may be combined with the Lambda-structure to get an action
of the full monoid $\mathbb{Z}$-$\{0\}$. It is important to remark here
that the $\Lambda$-structure on $K$-theory allows to get back
(as the spectrum of the Lambda-operations) the full $\mathbb{Z}$-grading
on Betti cohomology.

If one thinks of Lambda-structures
as related to the Banach ring of integers with their trivial norm,
one may seek for various generalizations, that will be called
"generalized Lambda-structure", associated to more general Banach rings.

## Definition

Let $(R,|\cdot|)$ be an integral Banach ring equipped with a multiplicative norm.
We will denote $\Lambda(R,|\cdot|)$ the monoid given by
$$\Lambda(R,|\cdot|):=\mathrm{Frac}(R)\cap \{a\in R,\;|a|\leq 1\}.$$

## Examples

There is not yet a precise notion of generalized Lambda-structure, but one may easily give various of its concrete incarnations.

1. The classical notion of ($\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded) Lambda-ring may be seen as a $\Lambda(\mathbb{Z},|\cdot|_0)=\mathbb{Z}$-$\{0\}$-structure. The cohomology theories of arithmetic geometry (i.e. for schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$) are often equipped with an $\mathbb{N}$-grading, that one may interpret as a classical Lambda-ring structure.

1. The notion of $\Lambda(\mathbb{Z},|\cdot|_\infty)=\{\pm 1\}$-structure is simply given by the notion of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading. Many cohomological invariants, such as $K$-theory, negative cyclic homology and the Chern character are equipped with a natural $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading. It is quite probable that one can't hope to get something more that a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading on a "really natural" cohomology theory in [[global analytic geometry]].

1. In the theory of $(\Phi,\Gamma)$-modules, the monoid $\Lambda(\mathbb{Z}_p,|\cdot|_p)=\mathbb{Z}_p$-$\{0\}$ plays a central role. It looks like a not so hard but important task to clarify the relation of this theory with the classical notion of Lambda-ring.

1. It is an interesting question to try to understand the relation of classical Hodge theory (over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) with the notion of Lambda-structure on the corresponding Banach ring. This may show interesting limits to the idea of generalizing Lambda-structures to other Banach rings.
