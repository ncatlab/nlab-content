## Definition 

A [[subset]] $S$ of a [[real number|real]] [[affine space]] $X$ is **convex** if for any two points $x,y \in S$, the straight line segment connecting $x$ with $y$ in $X$ is also contained in $S$.  In other words, for any $x,y\in S$, and any $t\in [0,1]$, we have also $t x + (1-t) y \in S$.

## Properties

Every convex set is [[star-shaped]] about each of its points, and hence [[contractible space|contractible]] provided it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

## Related notions

* One generalization of convexity to [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[metric space]]s is [[geodesic convexity]].

* An abstract generalization of the notion of a convex set is that of a [[convex space]].  Note that as mentioned there, there is a nice characterization of those convex spaces which are isomorphic to convex subsets of real affine space.

* The **convex hull** of a subset is the smallest convex subset containing it.
