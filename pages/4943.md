## Definition 

A [[subset]] $S \subset X$ of a [[Euclidean space]] $X$ is **convex** if for any two points $x,y \in S$ also the straight line segments connecting $x$ with $y$ in $X$ is in $S$.

The generalization of this to [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[metric space]]s is [[geodesic convexity]].


The **convex hull** of a subset is the smallest convex subset containing it.

A generalization of the notion of a convex set is that of a [[convex space]].

## Properties

Every convex set is [[star-shaped]].
