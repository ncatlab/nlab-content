## Idea

It has been argued that there are [[spacetimes]] which are such that they allow [[trajectories]] on which a [[computation|computing device]] could travel indefinitely together with spacetime points at which an observer could observe the whole infinite history of the computer in finite time. If this indeed were physically realizable it would to some extent physically implement what is called _[[hypercomputation]]_. This would contradict, to some extent, the [[physical Church-Turing thesis]], which asserts that no physical process can realize a computer more powerful than a Turing machine.
