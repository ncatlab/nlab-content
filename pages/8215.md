## Idea

For $S$ a [[simplicial set]] and $A$ an [[abelian group]], the _simplicial [[homology]]_ of $S$ is the [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] corresponding under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[simplicial abelian group]] $S \cdot A$ of $A$-[[chains]] on $S$: [[formal linear combinations]] of [[simplices]] in $S$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[simplicial set]] and $A$ an [[abelian group]].

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write 

$$
  S_n \cdot A \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}[S_n] \otimes A
$$

for the [[free abelian group]] on the set $S_n$  of $n$-[[simplices]] [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensored]] with $A$: the group of [[formal linear combinations]] of $n$-simplices with [[coefficients]] in $A$.

These abelian groups arrange to a [[simplicial abelian group]]

$$
  X \cdot A \in Ab^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

The [[alternating face map complex]] of this groups is called the **complex of simplicial chains** on $S$

$$
  C_\bullet(S \cdot A) = C_\bullet(S,A)
  \,.
$$

The **simplicial homology** of $S$ is the [[chain homology]] of the complex of simplicial chains:

$$
  H_\bullet(S, A)
  \coloneqq
  H_\bullet(C_\bullet(S,A))
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This means that the [[differentials]] in $C_\bullet(S,A)$ are given on [[basis]] elements $\sigma \in S_n$ by the [[formal linear combination]]

$$
  \partial \sigma
    = 
  \sum_{k = 0}^{n} (-1)^k d_k \sigma
  \,,
$$

where $d_k : S_n \to S_{n-1}$ are the [[face maps]] of $S$.

## Examples

### Explicit

+-- {: .num_example #OfTetrahedon}
###### Example

Let $S = \partial \Delta^3$ be the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary]] of the simplicial  3-[[simplex]], the (hollow) simplicial [[tetrahedron]].

Since this has 

* 4 non-degenerate vertices

* 6 non-degenerate edges

* 6 non-degenerate faces

the [[normalized chain complex]] of $\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form

$$
  \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z}^4 \to \mathbb{Z}^6 \to \mathbb{Z}^4 \to 0
  \,.
$$

By writing out the two non-trivial differentials, one can deduce explicitly that 

* $H_0(\partial \Delta^3) = \mathbb{Z}$ (reflecting the fact that the tetrahedron is [[connected topological space|connected]]);

* $H_1(\partial \Delta^3) = 0$ (reflectind the fact that it is [[simply-connected topological space|simply-connected]]);

* $H_2(\partial \Delta^3) = \mathbb{Z}$ (reflectind the fact, by the [[Hurewicz theorem]], that the second [[homotopy group]] of the 2-sphere is $\mathbb{Z}$ );

### General

* For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $S = Sing X$ the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$, the simplicial homology of $Sing X$ is called the _[[singular homology]]_ of $X$, denoted $H_\bullet(X,A)$.

* [[singular homology]]

## Terminology and a bit of history

The term simplicial homology is also used in the literature for the homology of polyhedral spaces, based on the theory of [[simplicial complex]]es.  That homology is defined by first looking at a chain complex of simplicial chains on, say, a triangulation of a space, and then passing to the corresponding homology.  The theory then proceeds by proving that the end result is independent of the triangulation used.  The resulting homology theory is isomorphic to singular homology, but historically was the earlier theory.
