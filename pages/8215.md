## Idea

For $S$ a [[simplicial set]] and $A$ an [[abelian group]], the _simplicial [[homology]]_ of $S$ is the [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] corresponding under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[simplicial abelian group]] $S \cdot A$ of $A$-[[chains]] on $S$: [[formal linear combinations]] of [[simplices]] in $S$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[simplicial set]] and $A$ an [[abelian group]].

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write 

$$
  S_n \cdot A \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}[S_n] \otimes A
$$

for the [[free abelian group]] on the set $S_n$  of $n$-[[simplices]] [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensored]] with $A$: the group of [[formal linear combinations]] of $n$-simplices with [[coefficients]] in $A$.

These abelian groups arrange to a [[simplicial abelian group]]

$$
  X \cdot A \in Ab^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

The [[alternating face map complex]] of this groups is called the **complex of simplicial chains** on $S$

$$
  C_\bullet(S \cdot A) = C_\bullet(S,A)
  \,.
$$

The **simplicial homology** of $S$ is the [[chain homology]] of the complex of simplicial chains:

$$
  H_\bullet(S, A)
  \coloneqq
  H_\bullet(C_\bullet(S,A))
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This means that the [[differentials]] in $C_\bullet(S,A)$ are given on [[basis]] elements $\sigma \in S_n$ by the [[formal linear combination]]

$$
  \partial \sigma
    = 
  \sum_{k = 0}^{n} (-1)^k d_k \sigma
  \,,
$$

where $d_k : S_n \to S_{n-1}$ are the [[face maps]] of $S$.

## Examples

* For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $S = Sing X$ the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$, the simplicial homology of $Sing X$ is called the _[[singular homology]]_ of $X$, denoted $H_\bullet(X,A)$.
