A _homotopical category_ is a construction used in [[homotopy theory]], related to but more flexible than a [[model category]].


#Definition#

A _homotopical category_ is a [[category with weak equivalences]] where on top of the 2-out-of-3-property the morphisms satisfy the 

**2-out-of-6-property**: 

If morphisms $h \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ are weak equivalences, then so are $f$, $g$, $h$ and $h \circ g \circ f$.

#Remarks#

* The 2-out-of-6-property implies the [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]]-property.

* A functor $F : C \to D$ between homotopical categories which preserves weak equivalences is a [[homotopical functor]].
