## Idea ##

Let $C$ be a category with a [[pretopology]] $J$ (i.e. a [[site]]) and let $a$ be an object of $C$. The [[slice category]] $C/a$ inherits a pretopology by setting the covering families to be those collections of morphisms whose image under $C/a \to C$ form a covering family. This is then the **big site** of $a$.

In the special case that $C$ is some category of spaces with a terminal object $t$, then sheaves on the large site of $t$ form a [[gros topos]]. Hence the category of sheaves on the large site of $a$ generalize this idea.
