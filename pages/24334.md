## Idea

Simplicial type theory is a [[homotopy type theory]] which introduces additional non-fibrant layers on top of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory to provide a logical calculus for geometric shapes, consisting of cube judgments, tope judgments, inequality topes, extension types, Segal types, Rezk types, and covariant fibrations.
