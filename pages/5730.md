## Idea

A **complex manifold** is a [[manifold]] modeled on $\mathbb{C}^n$ (the complex $n$-dimensional complex line):

* a [[smooth manifold]] locally isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$ whose transition functions are [[holomorphic function]]s.

* equivalently: a [[smooth manifold]] equipped with an integrable [[almost complex structure]] 

## Related concepts

* [[complex analytic space]]

* [[Dolbeault complex]]
