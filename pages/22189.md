  {#SwamplandCobordismConjectureReferences}


The _[[swampland cobordism conjecture]]_ is the [[conjecture]] that consistency of [[string theory vacuum|vacua]] in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]]/[[F-theory]] (hence their being in the "[[landscape of string theory vacua|landscape]]" instead of the "[[swampland]]") requires (undefined) [[string theory|stringy]]/[[quantum gravity]]-analogs of [[cobordism groups]] to vanish:

However, in the discussion offered in [McNama-Vafa 17, Sec. 4.5, 5.2](#McNamaVafa17), of [[24 branes transverse to K3]], it is crucially not the (ordinary) [[cobordism group]] which is [[trivial group|zero as a group]], but it is the total brane charge that is the [[zero]] _[[element]]_ in this group.  With the conjecture understood in this form, a suggestion for a rigorous formulation -- and a derivation from [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] -- is discussed in:
