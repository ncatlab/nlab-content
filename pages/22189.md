  {#SwamplandCobordismConjectureReferences}


The _[swampland cobordism conjecture](swampland#SwamplandCobordismConjecture)_ is the hypothesis that consistency of [[string theory vacuum|vacua]] in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]]/[[F-theory]] (hence their being in the "[[landscape of string theory vacua|landscape]]" instead of the "[[swampland]]") requires (undefined) [[string theory|stringy]]/[[quantum gravity]]-analogs of [[cobordism groups]] to vanish:

A more concrete consequence of this conjecture is claimed ([McNamara-Vafa 17, Sec. 5.2, 2nd paragr.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10355.pdf#page=31)) to be the statement that -- paraphrasing/extrapolating somewhat: _[[Dirac charge quantization|brane charges are quantized]] in [[Cobordism cohomology]]_; so that, in particular _[[tadpole cancellation]] of brane charges is to happen in [[Cobordism cohomology]]._ This statement is discussed, as a consequence of [[Hypothesis H]], in (see [p. 83](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01877.pdf#page=83)):
