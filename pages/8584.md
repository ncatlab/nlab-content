## Idea

In particle [[physics]], _matter_ is a [[bound state]] of [[fermion|fermionic]] [[particles]].

This is in contrast to [[force]] [[gauge fields|fields]], whose [[quanta]] are [[bosons|bosonic]] [[particles]].

In the [[standard model of particle physics]], all matter fields are [[sections]] of a [[spinor bundle]] on [[spacetime]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] of a $U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$-[[principal bundle]].

In the [[standard model of cosmology]] matter is characterized as part of the energy-momentum density with specific _parameter of state_ $w = p/\rho$, see at _[[FRW model]]_.
