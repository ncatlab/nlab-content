## Idea

In [[physics]] _matter_ is [[bound states]] of [[fermion|fermionic]] [[particles]].

This is in contrast to [[force]] [[gauge fields|fields]], whose [[quanta]] are [[bosons|bosonic]] [[particles]].

In the [[standard model of particle physics]] all matter fields are [[sections]] of a [[spinor bundle]] on [[spacetime]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] of a $U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$-[[principal bundle]].
