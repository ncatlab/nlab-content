## Idea

The concept of _polynomial functor_ is a [[categorification]] of that of _[[polynomial]]_. 

Polynomial endo-functors are used to encode a class of [[inductive types]] called _[[W-types]]_.

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[locally cartesian closed category]].  A **polynomial functor** is specified by the data
$$ W \overset{f}{\leftarrow} X \overset{g}{\to} Y \overset{h}{\to} Z $$
in $C$.  The resulting functor is the composite

$$ 
  C/W 
   \overset{f^*}{\to} 
  C/X 
   \overset{\Pi_g}{\to} 
  C/Y 
   \overset{\Sigma_h}{\to} 
  C/Z
  \,, 
$$

where $\Pi_g$ and $\Sigma_h$ are the [[dependent product]] and [[dependent sum]] operations, right and left adjoint respectively to [[pullback]] functors $g^*$ and $h^*$.

When $W=Z$, this is a **polynomial endofunctor**.

Sometimes this general notion is called a **dependent polynomial functor**, with "polynomial (endo)functor" reserved for the "one-variable" case, when $W=Z=1$ is the [[terminal object]].

The data $f$, $g$, and $h$ which specify a polynomial functor is sometimes referred to as a **container** (or an **indexed container**, with *container* reserved for the case $W=Z=1$).  Other times *container* is used as a synonym for "polynomial functor".

If $g$ is an identity, the functor is sometimes called a **linear functor** or a **linear polynomial functor**.  Note that this notion makes sense even if $C$ is not locally cartesian closed; all it needs are [[pullbacks]].  More generally, we can make sense of polynomial functors in any category with pullbacks if we restrict $g$ to be an [[exponentiable morphism]].


## Example

### On sets
 {#ExamplesOnSets}

For $C$ = [[Set]] the polynomial functor induced from a 
[[function]] $g$

$$
  \ast \stackrel{}{\leftarrow} X \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \ast
$$ 

is given by

$$
  S \mapsto P_f(S) = \coprod_{y \in Y} S^{X_y}
  \,,
$$

where $X_y$ is the [[fiber]] of $g$ over $y \in Y$, and where the [[exponential object]] $S^{X_y}$ is the [[function set]] of [[functions]] from the fiber to $S$. The [[cardinality]] of the set on the right is

$$
  {\vert P_g(S)\vert}
   = 
  \sum_{y \in Y} {\vert S\vert}^{\vert X_y\vert}
$$

and it is in this sense that the concept of polynomial functor is a kind of [[categorification]] of that of [[polynomial]].

On the other hand the dependent polynomial functor associated to

$$
  A \stackrel{p_1}{\leftarrow} X \stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow} X
  \stackrel{p_2}{\longrightarrow} B
$$ 

acts by

$$
  (S_a)_{a \in A}
  \mapsto
  \left(\coprod_{a \in A} S_a \times X_{a b} \right)_{b \in B}
  \,.
$$

Under [[cardinality]] this becomes [[matrix multiplication]] acting on [[vectors]] (with entries in the [[natural numbers]]). So in this case the dependent polynomial functor is a linear functor of several variables, an [[integral transform]].

## The 2-category of polynomial functors

Any polynomial functor, as defined above, is automatically equipped with a [[tensorial strength]], when the slice categories of $C$ are regarded as tensored over $C$ in the canonical way.  The following theorem is proven in [Gambino--Kock](#GK):

+--{: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
There is a [[bicategory]] whose objects are the objects of $C$, whose morphisms from $W$ to $Z$ are diagrams of the form
$$ W \overset{f}{\leftarrow} X \overset{g}{\to} Y \overset{h}{\to} Z, $$
and whose 2-morphisms are diagrams of the form
$$
\array{ & & X & \to & Y \\
  & \swarrow & \uparrow & & \mathllap{id}\uparrow & \searrow\\
  W && X' \times_{Y'} Y & \to & Y && Z\\
  &\nwarrow & \downarrow & & \downarrow & \nearrow \\
  && X' & \to & Y'. }
$$
This bicategory is equivalent to the 2-category whose objects are slice categories of $C$, whose morphisms are polynomial functors regarded as strong functors, and whose 2-morphisms are strength-respecting natural transformations.
=--

Note that the above bicategory contains, as a locally full sub-bicategory, the usual bicategory of [[spans]].  Thus, as a special case, the bicategory of spans is equivalent to the 2-category of "linear" polynomial functors.  Both of these are instances of [[Lack's coherence theorem]].

* Kripke frames $(R,S)$ (with a transition relation $R$ of arity $2$) as studied in [[modal logic]] are [[coalgebra]]s for the power-set functor $P$. Kripke frames for a more general *modal similarity type* $t$ are a coalgebras of a functor of the form $X\mapsto \product_{d\in t} P(S^{arity(d)})$. Kripke models are coalgebras of functor $K:X\mapsto P(Prop)\times P(X)$ where $Prop$ is the set of propositional variables of the logic in consideration. In particular all the functors appearing here are polynomial functors. So, at least in some aspects, the study of modal logics reduces to the study of (certain) polynomial functors
