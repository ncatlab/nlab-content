## Definition

The _theory of objects_ is the [[theory]] with no axioms over the [[signature (in logic)|signature]] with a single [[type]] and no primitive symbols except [[equality]].

So a [[model]] for this theory in a [[topos]] (or more generally a category) $\mathcal{E}$ is just an [[object]] of $\mathcal{E}$.

In the syntax-free approach to geometric theories of Johnstone (2002, I B4.2) the theory of objects corresponds to the forgetful functor sending an $\mathcal{S}$-topos to its underlying category (cf. [[geometric theory]] section 'functorial definition').

## Properties

###### Proposition

The [[classifying topos]] for the theory of objects is the [[presheaf topos]] $[FinSet, Set]$ over the [[opposite category]] of the category [[FinSet]] of [[finite sets]].

For more general base toposes $\mathcal{S}$, it is a theorem due to [[Andreas Blass]] that the theory of objects has a classifying topos precisely if $\mathcal{S}$ has a [[natural numbers object]].
