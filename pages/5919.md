## Definition

The _theory of objects_ is the [[theory]] over the [[signature (in logic)|signature]] with a single [[type]] and no primitive symbols except [[equality]], and no axioms.

So a [[model]] for this theory in a [[topos]], or more generally a category, $\mathcal{E}$ is just an [[object]] of $\mathcal{E}$.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[classifying topos]] for the theory of objects is the [[presheaf topos]] $[FinSet, Set]$ over the [[opposite category]] of the category [[FinSet]] of [[finite sets]].

See at _[[classifying topos for the theory of objects]]_.

For more general base toposes $\mathcal{S}$ it is a theorem due to [[Andreas Blass]] that the theory of objects has a classifying topos precisely if $\mathcal{S}$ has a [[natural numbers object]].
