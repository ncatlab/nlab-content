* Jacob Lurie, _Higher Topos Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040))

which discusses the theory of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] in general and that of $(\infty,1)$-categories of $(\infty,0)$-category valued [[sheaf|sheaves]] -- called (Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie) $(\infty,1)$-topoi -- in particular.

#Summary#

## General idea ## 

Recall the following familiar 1-categorical statement:

* Working in the 1-[[category]] 
[[Set]]
of [[0-category|0-categories]] is the same as 
doing [[set theory]]. The point of 
[[Categories and Sheaves|categories and sheaves]]
is to pass to _parameterized_ 
[[0-category|0-categories]], namely 
[[presheaf]] categories: these [[topos|topoi]]
behave much like the category [[Set]]
but their objects are generalized 
[[space and quantity|spaces]] that may carry 
more structure, for instance they may
be [[generalized smooth space]]s if one considers
(pre)[[sheaf|sheaves]] on [[Diff]].

One can think of Lurie's book as a comprehensive study
of the generalization of the above statement 
from $1$ to $(\infty,1)$ 
(recall the notion of [[(n,r)-category]]):

* Working in the $(\infty,1)$-[[category]] 
[[Infinity-Grpd]]
of [[infinity-groupoid|(infinity,0)-categories]] 
is the same as 
doing [[topology]]. The point of 
[[infinity-stack]]s
is to pass to _parameterized_ 
[[infinity-groupoid|(infinity,0)-categories]], 
namely 
[[(infinity,1)-presheaf]] categories: 
these [[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]]
behave much like the $(\infty,1)$category 
[[Infinity-Grpd]]
but their objects are generalized 
[[space and quantity|spaces]] 
with higher [[homotopy|homotopies]]
that may carry 
more structure, for instance they may
be $\infty$-[[differentiable stack]]s if one considers
[[infinity-stack]]s on [[Diff]].



## First part, sections 1-4

Based on work by Andr&eacute; Joyal on the [[quasicategory]] model for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]], Lurie presents a comprehensive account of the theory of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] including the definitions and properties of all the standard items familiar from category theory (limits, fibrations, etc.)

## Second part, sections 5-7 ##

Given the $(\infty,1)$-categorical machinery from the first part there are natural $(\infty,1)$-categorical versions of $(\infty,1)$-[[presheaf]] and $(\infty,1)$-[[sheaf]] categories (i.e. $(\infty,1)$-categories of [[infinity-stack]]s): the "$\infty$-topoi" that give the book its title (more descriptively, these would be called "Grothendieck $(\infty,1)$-topoi"). Lurie investigates their properties in great detail and thereby in particular puts the work by Brown, Joyal, Jardine, To&euml;n on [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] into a coherent $(\infty,1)$-categorical context.



#How to read this book#

## General remark ##

Don't be put-off by the sheer size. On top of everything else, Lurie is a great expositor. 

## 1-categorical background ##

The book _Higher topos theory_ together with Lurie's work on [[Stable Infinity-Categories]] is pretty much exactly the $(\infty,1)$-categorical analog of the 1-categorical material as presented for instance in

* Kashiwara and Shapira, [[Categories and Sheaves]].

## Sections with crucial concepts ##

The book discusses crucial concepts and works out plenty of detailed properties. On first reading it may be helpful to skip over all the technical parts and pick out just the central conceptual ideas. These are the following:

* [section 1.1](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=13) : the concept of [[(infinity,1)-category]]

* [section 5.1](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=256): the concept of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]]

* [section 6.1](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=426): the concept of [[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]]

* [section 6.2](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=459) 
[section 6.5](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=521) 
and : relation to the Brown-Joyal-Jardine-To&euml;n
theory of [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stack]]s
in terms of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]].
