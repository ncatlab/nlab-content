This entry is about the book

* Jacob Lurie, _Higher Topos Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040))

which discusses the theory of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] in general and that of $(\infty,1)$-categories of $(\infty,0)$-category valued [[sheaf|sheaves]] -- called (Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie) $(\infty,1)$-topoi -- in particular.

#Summary#

## First part, sections 1-4

Based on work by Andr&eacute; Joyal on the [[quasicategory]] model for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]], Lurie presents a comprehensive account of the theory of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] including the definitions and properties of all the standard items familiar from category theory (limits, fibrations, etc.)

## Second part, sections 5-7 ##

Given the $(\infty,1)$-categorical machinery from the first part there are natural $(\infty,1)$-categorical versions of $(\infty,1)$-[[presheaf]] and $(\infty,1)$-[[sheaf]] categories (i.e. $(\infty,1)$-categories of [[infinity-stack]]s): the "$\infty$-topoi" that give the book its title (more descriptively, these would be called "Grothendieck $(\infty,1)$-topoi"). Lurie investigates their properties in great detail and thereby in particular puts the work by Brown, Joyal, Jardine, To&euml;n on [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] into a coherent $(\infty,1)$-categorical context.



#How to read this book#

## General remark ##

Don't be put-off by the sheer size. On top of everything else, Lurie is a great expositor. 

## 1-categorical background ##

The book _Higher topos theory_ together with Lurie's work on [[Stable Infinity-Categories]] is pretty much exactly the $(\infty,1)$-categorical analog of the 1-categorical material as presented for instance in

* Kashiwara and Shapira, [[Categories and Sheaves]].
