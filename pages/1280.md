A paraconsistent logic is one that does not include the _law of non-contradiction_, that is, the schema $A, \neg{A} \vdash B$ for all formulas $A$ and $B$.  An example is [[minimal logic]], which simply omits the law $\bot \vdash B$ (which is otherwise used in the proof) from the presentation of intuitionistic logic.

I made a big change here; I would argue that the failure of $\bot \vdash B$ means that ‘$\bot$’ simply doesn\'t mean $\bot$; but in any case, I\'ve always seen the definition given in terms of negation.  In particular, dual-intuitionistic logic has $\bot \vdash B$ (just as intuitionistic logic has $B \vdash \top$) but is still considered paraconsistent.

[[Finn Lawler|Finn]]: Hmm.  (I presume you meant the ')' to come before 'but is still...'; as it stands that last statement is false.)  The definitions I've seen correspond to what I wrote, but you make a good point -- if we want to think of $LJ^{op}$ as paraconsistent then the definition by means of _ex falso quodlibet_ does seem wrong.  If this is the standard definition, then I certainly won't object -- I'll just avoid relying on philosophers for information about logic in future.

_Toby_:  Yeah, I\'m sure about the standard; our links agree with me too.  (And thanks for catching my parenthesis.)  As for philosophers, they\'re not always as precise as mathematicians; that may be the problem.  Not to mention, there\'s a tendency not to include $\bot$ as a logical constant but instead to simply *define* it as $A \wedge \neg{A}$ (after proving that these are all equivalent, but ignoring the possibility of an empty model), which leads to conflating the two versions.  (In a paraconsistent logic where $A \wedge \neg{A} \equiv B \wedge \neg{B}$ need not hold, one ought to catch the inapplicability of this definition, but maybe not.)
