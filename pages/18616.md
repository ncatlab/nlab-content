## Definition

Let $(S,\leq)$ be a [[preorder]], that is a [[set]] with a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation]] on it. There is a unique [[small category]] whose [[objects]] are elements of $S$ and which has exactly one [[morphism]] from $s$ to $s'$ iff $s\leq s'$. We say that this category is the __preorder category__ associated to $(S,\leq)$. 

If $\leq$ is also [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], that is $(S,\leq)$ is a [[partially ordered set]] (also said to be an order(ing)) then we say __order category__ instead. If the preorder is a [[directed set]] then the preorder category is said to be directed. 

## Examples

* A prominent class of posets sometimes considered as order categories include [[frames]] (which give rise to [[locales]]). 

* Preorder categories arising from [[categories of modules]] and [[Abelian categories]] in general are an intermediate step in a systematic study of spectra, see at _[[spectral cookbook]]_.
