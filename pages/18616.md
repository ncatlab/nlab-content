Let $(S,\leq)$ be a [[preorder]], that is a set with a reflexive and transitive relation on it. There is a unique small category whose objects are elements of $S$ and which has exactly one arrow from $s$ to $s'$ iff $s\leq s'$. We say that this category is the __preorder category__ associated to $(S,\leq)$. If $\leq$ is also antisymmetric, that is $(S,\leq)$ is a [[partially ordered set]] (also said to be an order(ing)) then we say __order category__ instead. If the preorder is a [[directed set]] then the preorder category is said to be directed. 

A prominent class of posets sometimes considered as order categories include [[frame]]s (which give rise to [[locale]]s). Preorder categories arising from categories of modules and Abelian categories in general are an intermediate step in a systematic study of spectra, see [[spectral cookbook]].
