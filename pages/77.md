## Definition

Given a [[commutative unital ring]] $k$, and a (strict for simplicity) [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] $k$-[[linear category]] $(C,\otimes,1)$ with the symmetry $\tau$, a **Lie algebra** in $(C,\otimes,1,\tau)$ is an object $L$ in $C$ together with a morphism $[,]: A\otimes A\to A$ such that the Jacobi identity 

$$[,[,]]+[,[,]]\circ(id_L\otimes\tau_{L,L})\circ(\tau\otimes id_L)+[,[,]]\circ (\tau_{L,L}\otimes id_L)\circ (id_L\otimes\tau_{L,L}) = 0$$ 

and antisymmetry 

$$[,]+[,]\otimes\tau_{L,L} = 0$$

hold. If $k$ is the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integer]]s, then we say (internal) __Lie ring__, and if $k$ is a [[field]] and $C=Vec$ then we say a __Lie $k$-algebra__. Other interesting cases are super-Lie algebras, which are the Lie algebras in the symmetric monoidal category $\mathbb{Z}_2-Vec$ of [[supervector space]]s and the Lie algebras in the [[Loday-Pirashvili tensor category]] of linear maps. 

Alternatively, Lie algebras are the algebras over certain quadratic [[operad]], called the [[Lie algebra operad]]. The [[Koszul dual]] of this operad is the [[commutative algebra]] operad.

[[Eric]]: Is it possible to turn the previous paragraph around? Instead saying Lie algebras are certain quadratic operads and pointing out their Koszul dual is a commutative algebra operad, could you instead say something like 

>Alternatively, Lie algebras are algebras over the Koszul dual of a commutative algebra operad.

A Lie algebra is a special case of an [[L-infinity algebra]] with generators only in lowest degree.
