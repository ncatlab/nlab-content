## Idea ##

A _combinatorial model catgeory_ is a particularly convenient [[model category]] structure.

## Definition ##

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
(Jeff Smith)

A [[model category]] $C$ is **combinatorial** if it is

* [[presentable category|presentable]]

and

* [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]].

=--

Recall from the discussion at [[cofibrantly generated model category]] that this means that $C$ has a [[set]] (not a proper [[class]]) $I$ of generating cofibrations and and a set of trivial generating cofibrations in that

  $$ 
    cof = llp(rlp(I))
  $$
  
  $$
    fib = llp(rlp(J))
    \,.
  $$


Here $fib, cof \subset Mor(C)$ is the collection of fibrations and cofibration, respectively, and $llp(S), rlp(S)$ is the collection of morphisms satisfying the left or right, respectively, [[lifting property]] with respect to a collection of morphisms $S$. 

## Jeff Smith's theorem ##

The central theorem about combinatorial model categories is **Jeff Smith's theorem** which establishes the existence of model category structures from a comparatively small amount of input data.

###### Theorem (Jeff Smith)

Let $C$ be a [[locally presentable category]], $W$ an accessibly embedded [[accessible category|accessible]] [[subcategory]] of the [[arrow category]] $Arr(C)$, and $I \subset Mor(C)$ a [[set]] (not a proper class) of morphisms of $C$ such that

* $W$ satisfies [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]];

* $inj(I) \subset W$

* $cof(I) \cap W$ is closed under [[pushout]] and [[transfinite composition]].

Then $C$ is a combinatorial model category with

* weak equivalences $W$;

* cofibrations $cof(I)$.

=--

Here $inj(I) = rlp(I)$ and $cof(I) = llp(rlp(I))$.

This statement was announced by Jeff Smith in 1998 at a conference in Barcelona and appeared in print as theorem 1.7 in

* [[Tibor Beke]], _Sheafifiable homotopy model categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv1.library.cornell.edu/abs/math/0102087))

The above statement follows prop 2.2 in 

* [[Clark Barwick]], _On left and right model categories and left and right Bousfield localization_ ([pdf](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~clarkbar/complete.pdf))

The **proof** proceeds via two lemmas

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma (Smith)

If a sub-class $J \subset cof(I) \cap W$ is such that every commutative square

$$
  \array{
    K &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i \in I}} && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{w \in W}}
    \\
    L &\to& Y
  }
$$

may be factored as

$$
  \array{
    K &\to& X' &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i \in I}} && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j \in J}} && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{w \in W}}
    \\
    L &\to& L' &\to& Y
  }
$$

then 

$$
  cof(j) = cof(I) \cap W
  \,.
$$

## Simplicial combinatorial model categories ##

Of interest are the combinatorial model categories that are at the same time [[simplicial model categories]]. These are precisely those that present [[presentable (∞,1)-categories]].

See [[combinatorial simplicial model category]].


## Combinatorial model categories from cofibrantly generated ones ##


Not every [[cofibrantly generated model category]] is also a combinatorial model category. 

For instance the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]] is cofibrantly generated, but not combinatorial. But it is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to a combinatorial model structure, namely to the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

One might therefore ask which cofibrantly generated model categories are Quillen equivalent to combinatorial ones. See 

* J. Rosicky, _Are all cofibrantly generated model categories combinatorial?_ ([ps](http://www.math.muni.cz/~rosicky/papers/cof1.ps))
