## Idea

Given a [[homotopical category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (such as a [[model category]]), a morphism is called _sharp_ if its [[pullback]] along any other morphism is already a [[homotopy pullback]].

## Definition

In a [[model category]] $\mathcal{M}$, a **sharp map** is a morphism $p : X \to Y$ satisfying the following condition: for any commutative diagram in $\mathcal{M}$ of the form below,
$$
  \array{
    X'' & \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} & X' & \longrightarrow & X \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} \\
    Y'' & \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} & Y' & \longrightarrow & Y
  }
$$
if $g : Y'' \to Y'$ is a weak equivalence and both squares are pullback diagrams, then  $f : X'' \to X'$ is also a weak equivalence.

## Properties

A model category is [[right proper model category|right proper]] if and only if every fibration is sharp.

In a [[right proper model category]], the sharp maps in the full subcategory on sharp-fibrant objects form the fibrations of a [[category of fibrant objects]]. See there the section _[Examples -- Right proper model categories](category+of+fibrant+objects#RightProperModelCategories)_.
