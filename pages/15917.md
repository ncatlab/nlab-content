## Definition

Given a [[homotopical category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (such as a [[model category]]), a morphism is called _sharp_ if its [[pullback]] along any other moprhism is already a [[homotopy pullback]].

## Properties

In a [[right proper model category]] the sharp maps in the full subcatgeory on sharp-fibrant objects form the fibrations of a [[category of fibrant objects]]. See there the section _[Examples -- Right proper model categories](category+of+fibrant+objects#RightProperModelCategories)_.
