## Idea

A [[Sullivan model]] for the ([[reduced suspension|reduced]]) [[suspension]] of a ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological space]] $X$ is obtained from a [[Sullivan model]] for $X$ itself essentially by shifting up all generators in degree by one and forcing all their wedge products to vanish.

## Details

See e.g. [Félix-Murillo-Tanré 10, Prop. 5.1](#FelixMurilloTanre10)
