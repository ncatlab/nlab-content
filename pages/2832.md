## Idea ##

Order theory, the study of [[orders]], is one of the main branches of [[mathematics]], but it often gets short shrift.  Many (but not all) of the ideas of [[category theory]] that don\'t apply to [[groupoids]] or [[sets]] already apply to [[posets]].  (Of course, order theory also has features of interest for its own sake.)


## As low-dimensional higher category theory

In the context of [[(n,r)-category]] theory, ordinary [[category theory]] is the study of $(1,1)$-[[1-category|categories]]. Following the spirit of [[negative thinking]], we find that one dimention below this is not just [[set theory]] as the study of $(0,0)$-[[0-category|categories]], but a richer theory, that of $(0,1)$-categories. These are [[poset]]s: sets with order. Thus order theory is the study of $(0,1)$-categories.
