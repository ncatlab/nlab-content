## Idea ##

In the context of [[(n,r)-category]] theory, ordinary [[category theory]] is the study of $(1,r)$-categories. Following the spirit of [[negative thinking]], we find that one dimention below this is not just [[set theory]] as the study of [[0-category|0-categories]], but a richer theory, that of $(0,r)$-categories. For $r = 1$ these are [[poset]]s: sets with order. _Order theory_ is the study of $(0,r)$-categories.

A comparative discussion of order theory as compared to category theory is at [[category theory vs order theory]].
