## Idea

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $H \in \Omega^3(X)$ a closed [[differential form|differential 3-form]], the $H$ **twisted de Rham complex** is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space]] $\Omega^{even}(X) \oplus \Omega^{odd}(X)$ equipped with the $H$-twisted [[de Rham differential]]

$$
  d + H \wedge(-) : \Omega^{even/odd}(X) \to \Omega^{odd/even}(X)
  \,,
$$

Notice that this is nilpotent, due to the odd degree of $H$, such that $H \wedge H = 0$, and the closure of $H$, $d H = 0$.

## Properties

Twisted de Rham cohomology is the recipient of the [[twisted Chern character]] in [[twisted differential K-theory]].
