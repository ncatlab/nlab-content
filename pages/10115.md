## Idea

The 2-[[sphere]] with its canonical structure of a [[complex manifold]] is called the _[[Riemann sphere]]_.

As such this is [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^1$.

## Properties

The [[biholomorphisms]], i.e. the bijective [[conformal transformations]] from the Riemann sphere to itself are the [[Möbius transformations]].
