## Idea 

An ordinary [[(∞,1)-operad]] $\mathcal{O}$ is equivalently incarnated as its [[(∞,1)-category of operators]] $\mathcal{O}^\otimes \to FinSet_*$, which in particular has the property that $\mathcal{O}^{\otimes}_{\langle 0\rangle} \simeq *$.

A _generalized $(\infty,1)$-operad_ is like an [[(∞,1)-category of operators]] only that this condition is dropped and 

$$
  \mathcal{C} \coloneqq \mathcal{O}^{\otimes}_{\langle 0\rangle}
$$

is allowed to be any [[(∞,1)-category]].

It is essentially the same kind of data as a [[family of (∞,1)-operads]] (see there for more) parameterized over $\mathcal{C}$.
