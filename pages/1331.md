## Idea 

The notion of  _reflective $(\infty,1)$-subcategory_ is the generalization of the notion of [[reflective subcategory]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.

## Definition 

A [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  i : C_0 \hookrightarrow C
$$

exhibits $D$ as a **reflective $(\infty,1)$-subcategory** (of $C$) if it has a left [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] $L : C \to C_0$.

$$
  (L \dashv i) : C_0 \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  C
  \,.
$$


The [[(∞,1)-functor]] $L$ is [[localization of an (∞,1)-category]].



## Relation to inversion of morphisms

There is a close relation between reflective $(\infty,1)$-subcategories and $(\infty,1)$-categories obtained by "inverting" morphisms in other $(\infty,1)$-categories.

A [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category|localization functor]]

$$
  L : C \to C' \hookrightarrow C 
$$

is determined, up to equivalence, by the collection $S$ of morphisms such that $L f$ is an equivalence.

See [section 5.5.4](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=383) of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]].

**Propositon ([5.5.4.15](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=391) in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]])**

Let $C$ be a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] and $S$ a small collection of morphisms of $C$. Let $\bar S$ denote the [[strongly saturated class of morphisms]] generated by $S$. Let $C' \hookrightarrow C$ be denote the full [[sub-quasi-category|sub-(∞,1)-category]] consistsing of $S$-[[local objects]]. Then 

* For each object $c \in C$ there exists a morphism $s : C \to C'$ such that $C'$ is $S$-local and s belongs to $\bar S$.

* $C'$ is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]]

* $C' \hookrightarrow C$ is a [[reflective (∞,1)-subcategory]].

* For every morphism $f$ of $C$ the following are equivalent:

  * the morphism $f$ is an $S$-equivalence;

  * the morphism $f$ belongs to $\bar S$;

  * for $L : C \to C'$ the [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category|localization functor]] left adjoint to $C' \hookrightarrow C$ the induced morphism $L f$ is an equivalence.
