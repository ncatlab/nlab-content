## Idea

A _prime geodesic_ is a primitive closed [[geodesic]] in a [[hyperbolic manifold]].


## Properties

### Analogy with prime numbers
 {#AnalogyWithPrimeNumbers}

Prime geodesics in hyperbolic geometry are in several ways [[analogy|analogous]] to [[prime numbers]] and [[prime ideals]] in [[arithmetic geometry]]. 

Notably they appear in the [[Selberg zeta function]] (see there) in the same way as prime ideals appear in the [[Artin L-function]], and moreover their [[asymptotics]] is controled in an analogous way by this function via the [[prime geodesic theorem]] as that of prime numbers is by the [[prime number theorem]] and the [[Riemann zeta function]].

A table of analogies is in ([Brown 09, p. 9](#Brown09)). Some are also mentioned in [Wikipedia, prime geodesic -- Number theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_geodesic#Number_theory).

### Prime geodesic theorem

The [[prime geodesic theorem]] (e.g. [Soundararajan-Young 13](#SoundararajanYoung13)) describes the [[asymptotic]] distribution of prime geodesics in [[analogy]] to the [[prime number theorem]].

## Related concepts

* The [[Selberg zeta function]] of a hyperbolic manifold is an [[infinite product]] over prime geodesics.
