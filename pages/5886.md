## Definition

The phrase **cartesian functor** has been used in category theory with several different (but related) meanings.

* A functor between [[fibered categories]] has been called __cartesian__ if it sends [[cartesian morphisms]] into cartesian morphisms.

* A functor between categories with finite [[products]] has been called __cartesian__ if it [[preserved limit|preserves]] finite products (that is, it is a [[strong monoidal functor]] between [[cartesian monoidal categories]]).

* A functor between [[finitely complete categories]] has been called __cartesian__ (notably in [[Sketches of an Elephant]]) if it preserves finite limits.  This is the case just when the induced functor on [[codomain fibrations]] is cartesian in the first sense.

Because of this ambiguity, it is perhaps always better to use a more precise term such as "(strong) morphism of fibrations", "cartesian monoidal functor" or "finite product preserving functor", and "finitely continuous functor" or "lex functor".
