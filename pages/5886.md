## Definition

A [[strong monoidal functor]] between [[cartesian monoidal categories]] is called a **cartesian functor**. In other words, it preserved finite [[product]]s up to isomorphism (which is the default setting for category theory anyway).

More generally, a functor between Grothendieck's [[fibered categories]] is __cartesian__ if it sends [[cartesian morphism]]s into cartesian morphisms. The first definition then follows in the case of the [[codomain fibration]] for cartesian categories (with a choice of cartesian lifts to make them also monoidal categories).

Note that Johnstone, in the [[Elephant]], uses the term 'cartesian' to mean that a functor preserves all finite [[limits]], not just products.

## Examples

* The 1-[[morphism]]s in a [[2-category]] of [[stack]], regarded dually under the [[Grothendieck construction]] as a 2-category of [[fibered categories]], are defined to be the cartesian functors.
