I studied category theory briefly the University of Rochester long ago.

The editing process needs a preview function...

+-- {: .query}
Welcome!  You may want to read [[About]], [[HowTo]], and [[FAQ]].

The preview function is as follows:

*  Submit your entry.
*  Edit the entry again right away.
*  Go back and forth between the entry and your edit window as you fix any errors.
*  If you don\'t wish to modify it further, cancel your edit so that others can edit the page.
*  But if you submit again within half an hour (using the same signature) and nobody else overrides your lock on the entry, then it will all count as one edit.
