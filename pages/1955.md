Given a morphism of [[commutative unital rings]] $f:R\to S$, the __module of Kähler differentials__ is the $S$-module $\Omega^1_{S/R}$ corepresenting the functor

$$Der_R(S,f_*(-)) : S-Mod\to Set : M\mapsto Der_R(S,f_* M)$$

where $f_*:S-Mod\to R-Mod$ is the restriction of scalars. In other words,  $Der_R(S,f_*M)\cong Hom_S(\Omega^1_{S/R},M)$. In a diagram: for every $R$-derivation $X\colon S \to M$ there is a unique morphism (of $S$-modules) $\mu\colon \Omega^1_{S/R} \to M$ making the following diagram commute:

$$
\array{
S&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{D}\searr&\uparrow \mu\\
 &                   & \Omega^1_{S/R}
}
$$


Let $I$ be the augmentation ideal, i.e. the kernel of the multiplication map

$$ I := Ker(m:S\otimes_R S\to S)$$

Then $\Omega^1_{S/R}= I/I^2$ and there is a canonical induced map $d: S\to \Omega^1_{S/R}$
given by $d s = [1\otimes s - s\otimes 1]$. 

If $R$ is in charectaristic zero, one introduces Kähler $p$-forms, which are elements of the $p$-th [[exterior power]] $\Omega^p_{S/R}:=\Lambda_R^p \Omega^1_{S/R}$. The module of Kähler differentials readily generalizes as a sheaf of Kähler differentials for a separated morphism $f:X\to Y$ of (commutative) [[schemes]], namely it is the pullback along the embedding of the ideal sheaf of the [[diagonal subobject|diagonal subscheme]] $X\hookrightarrow X\times_Y X$.

Compare the role of [[universal differential envelope]] and [[Amitsur complex]] for  analogous constructions in the noncommutative case. The appropriate extension of the module of relative Kähler differentials to the derived setting is the [[cotangent complex]] of Grothendieck-Illusie.
