## Idea

We may define Kähler differentials $\Omega^1_K(A)$ for any [[commutative algebra]] $A$.  When $A$ is an algebra of smooth functions on some space you know and love, Kähler differentials tend to act roughly like 1-forms on this space.  Indeed, when $A$ consists of the algebraic functions on an affine [[algebraic variety]], Kähler differentials are often taken as a _definition_ of 1-forms.  When $A$ consists of smooth functions on a manifold, the Kähler differentials do not agree with the ordinary smooth 1-forms on this manifold.  However, there is a map from the Kähler differentials to the ordinary 1-forms.

Conceptually, a symmetry of a commutative algebra $A$ is an [[automorphism]] $g\colon A\to A$, i.e., $g(a b)=g(a)g(b)$. The 'infinitesimal' symmetries are the [[derivations]] $X\colon A\to A$, with $X(a b)=X(a)b+X(a)b$. The [[module]] of Kähler differentials $\Omega^1_K(A)$  parametrizes derivations, in the sense that every derivation $X$ corresponds uniquely to a morphism of $A$-modules $\mu_X: \Omega_K^1 (A)\to A$. 

## Definition 

Suppose $A$ is a [[commutative algebra]] over a field $k$.   We may define Kähler differentials either by an explicit construction or by a universal property. In fact there are two explicit constructions.

The simplest construction, maybe, is as follows. The module of **Kähler differentials** $\Omega^1_K(A)$ over $A$ is generated by symbols $d a$ for all $a\in A$, subject to these relations:

* $d c = 0$ when $c$ is a 'constant', that is, an element of $k$ regarded as an element of $A$.

* $d(a b)=(d a)b+a(d b)$.

* $d(a+b)=d a+d b$.

* $(d a)b = b(d a)$.

In particular there are only finite sums in the module of Kähler differentials.  

Another more sophisticated construction of $\Omega^1_K(A)$ is given below.  But turning to the universal property, note that we can define **derivations** from $A$ to any $A$-[[module]] $M$: they are $k$-linear maps $X : A \to M$ satisfying the product rule:

$$ X(a b) = X(a) b + a X(b) $$

Then $\Omega^1_K(A)$ may be defined as the [[universal property|universal]] $A$-module equipped with a derivation.  In other words, there is a derivation 

$$d : A \to \Omega^1_K(A), $$

and if $X:A\to M$ is any [[derivation]] from $A$ to some $A$-module $M$, then there is a unique $A$-module morphism 

$$\mu_X:\Omega_K^1(A)\to M$$

such that the following diagram commutes:

$$
\array{
A&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{d}\searr&\uparrow \mu_X\\
 &                   & \Omega_K^1{A}
}
$$

We say that $X$ **factors through** $d$.


## Generalizations

### Relative version

We can replace the commutative algebra $A$ more generally by  a [[morphism]] of [[commutative unital rings]] $f:R\to S$. Then the __module of Kähler differentials__ is the $S$-[[module]] $\Omega^1_K(S/R)$ corepresenting the functor

$$Der_R(S,f_*(-)) : S Mod\to Set : M\mapsto Der_R(S,f_* M)$$

that assigns to every $S$-[[module]] $M$ the [[set]] of [[derivations]] on $S$ with values in the (bi)module $f_* M$, where $f_*:S Mod\to R Mod$ is the restriction of scalars. 

In other words,  $Der_R(S,f_*M)\cong Hom_S(\Omega^1_K(S/R),M)$. In a diagram: for every $R$-derivation $X\colon S \to M$ there is a unique morphism (of $S$-modules) $\mu\colon \Omega^1_K(S/R) \to M$ making the following diagram commute:

$$
\array{
S&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{d}\searr&\uparrow \mu\\
 &                   & \Omega^1_K(S/R)
}
$$

This framework also gives another construction of the module of Kähler differentials, instead of the generators and relations definition given above.

Let $I$ be the [[augmentation ideal]], i.e. the kernel of the multiplication map

$$ I := Ker(m:S\otimes_R S\to S)$$

Then $\Omega^1_K_{S/R}= I/I^2$ and there is a canonical induced map $d: S\to \Omega^1_{S/R}$
given by $d s = [1\otimes s - s\otimes 1]$. 

Furthermore, if $R$ is in characteristic zero, one may introduce **Kähler $p$-forms** , which are elements of the $p$-th [[exterior power]] $\Omega^p_K_{S/R}:=\Lambda_R^p \Omega^1_K_{S/R}$. The [[module]] of Kähler differentials readily generalizes as a [[sheaf]] of Kähler differentials for a separated morphism $f:X\to Y$ of (commutative) [[schemes]], namely it is the [[pullback]] along the embedding of the ideal sheaf of the [[diagonal subobject|diagonal subscheme]] $X\hookrightarrow X\times_Y X$.

Compare the role of [[universal differential envelope]] and [[Amitsur complex]] for  analogous constructions in the noncommutative case. The appropriate extension of the module of relative Kähler differentials to the derived setting is the [[cotangent complex]] of Grothendieck--Illusie. 

### Higher categorical version

The generalization of Kähler differentials from [[algebra]] to [[higher algebra]] is given by the notion of [[cotangent complex]] and its generalizations. For more on this see [[Deformation Theory]].

## Relation to ordinary forms 

We discuss how Kähler differential forms relate to the ordinary notion of [[differential form]]s.

Since there are only finite sums in the module of Kähler differentials, the usual $d f=f' d t$ works only if $f$ is a finite polynomial in $t$, say, if $A$ is $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ ([[smooth map|smooth maps]]) or $\mathbb{R}[\![t]\!]$ ([[power series]]). For example, let $f = t^n$ then

$$\begin{aligned}
d f &= 
d(t^n)  \\
&= t^{n-1} d t  + t(d t^{n-1}) \\
&= 2 t^{n-1} d t + t^2 d(t^{n-2}) \\
&= r t^{n-1} d t + t^r d(t^{n-r}) \\
&= n t^{n-1} d t \\
&= f' d t.
\end{aligned}$$


However, we have

$$d e^t \ne e^t d t$$

as Kähler differentials.  Intuitively, the reason is that $d$ cannot pass through the infinite sum

$$d e^t = d\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!}\right) \ne \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{d(t^n)}{n!} = e^t d t.$$

However, the only proof we know that $d e^t \ne e^t d t$ is quite tricky: in fact it uses the Axiom of Choice!

* David Speyer, Kähler differentials and ordinary differentials.  ([Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/6074/kahler-differentials-and-ordinary-differentials/9723#9723))

It would be  desirable to either find a proof that avoids the Axiom of Choice, or show that axioms beyond ZF are necessary for this result.

To avoid this annoying property of Kähler differentials we can proceed as follows.  Given a commutative algebra $A$, let $Der(A)$ be the $A$-bimodule of derivations.  Then it is not hard to check that $Der(A)$ is the dual of 

Define $\Omega^1(A)$ to be the dual of $Der(A)$:

$$ \Omega^1(A) = Der(A)^* $$

in other words, the set of $A$-module maps $\omega : Der(A) \to A$, made into an $A$-module in the usual way.   There is a derivation

$$ d : A \to \Omega^1(A) $$

given by 

$$ d f (X) = X(f)$$

for $X \in Der(A)$.

Now, suppose  $A=C^\infty(M)$ where $M$ is any smooth manifold.  Then elements of $\Omega^1(A)$ can be identified with ordinary smooth 1-forms on $M$.  This requires some work: the key is to show that every derivation of $A$ comes from a smooth vector field on $M$.   And in this case, one can show that any derivation $X: A \to M$ factors through $Omega^1(A)$ when $M$ is free, and in particular if $M=A$. 

We can expand on this remark as follows.  Quite generally, for any commutative algebra $A$ over a field $k$, we have

$$ Der(A) \cong \Omega^1_K(A)^* $$

and by definition

$$\Omega^1(A) = Der(A)^* $$

so we have

$$\Omega^1(A) \cong \Omega^1_K(A)^{**} $$

There is always a homomorphism from a module to its double dual, so we have

$$ j: \Omega^1_K(A) \to \Omega^1(A) $$

In the case when $A = C^\infty(M)$ this map is onto but typically not one-to-one, as witnessed by the fact that
$d e^t = e^t d t$ in the ordinary 1-forms $\Omega^1(A)$
but not in the Kähler differentials $\Omega^1_K(A)$.  However, one can show that when $M$ is a free $A$-module, any derivation $X: A \to M$ not only factors through $\Omega^1_K(A)$ (as guaranteed by the universal property of
Kähler differentials), but also $\Omega^1(A)$.

+-- {: .query}
[[Eric]]: Does this universal property mean that there is some diagram in some category for which the Kähler differentials can be thought of as a (co)limit?

[[John Baez]]: Yeah, take the category all $A$ modules $M$ equipped with a derivation $X : A \to M$, and take the diagram which consists of every object in this category and every morphism, and take the colimit of that, and you'll get $\Omega^1_K(A)$.  

But this is just a cutesy way to say that $\Omega^1_K(A)$ is the [[initial object]] of this category.  

And _this_, in turn, is just a cutesy way to say that there is a derivation 

$$d : A \to \Omega^1_K(A), $$

such that if $X:A\to M$ is also a derivation, then there exists a unique $A$-module morphism 

$$\mu_X:\Omega_K^1(A)\to M$$

such that the following diagram commutes:

$$
\array{
A&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{d}\searr&\uparrow \mu_X\\
 &                   & \Omega_K^1{A}
}
$$

All this is general abstract nonsense, nothing special to this example!  Any universal property involving maps out of an object says that object is initial in some category --- and that, in turn, is equivalent to saying that object is the colimit of the enormous diagram consisting of all objects of the same kind!  There's a lot less here than meets the eye.

[[Eric]]: Thank you! That actually makes a little sense to me. As trivial as it may seem, the fact that I was even able to ask this question represents tremendous progress :)
