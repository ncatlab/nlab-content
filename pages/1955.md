## Idea

The point of Kähler differentials is a [[universal property|universality property]]: if $X:A\to M$ is any [[derivation]] from a [[Ring|commutative unital ring]] $A$ to an $A$-[[module]] $M$, then there is a unique $A$-module morphism $\mu:\Omega_K(A)\to M$ such that $X(a)=\mu(d a)$, and conversely, for each $A$-module morphism $\mu:\Omega_K(A)\to M$ there is a derivation from $A$ to $M$, satisfying that relation.

## Definition

Given a [[morphism]] of [[commutative unital rings]] $f:R\to S$, the __module of Kähler differentials__ is the $S$-[[module]] $\Omega^1_{S/R}$ corepresenting the functor

$$Der_R(S,f_*(-)) : S-Mod\to Set : M\mapsto Der_R(S,f_* M)$$

that assigns to every $S$-[[module]] $M$ the [[set]] of [[derivation]]s on $S$ with values in the (bi)module $f_* M$, where $f_*:S Mod\to R Mod$ is the restriction of scalars. 

In other words,  $Der_R(S,f_*M)\cong Hom_S(\Omega^1_{S/R},M)$. In a diagram: for every $R$-derivation $X\colon S \to M$ there is a unique morphism (of $S$-modules) $\mu\colon \Omega^1_{S/R} \to M$ making the following diagram commute:

$$
\array{
S&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{D}\searr&\uparrow \mu\\
 &                   & \Omega^1_{S/R}
}
$$


## Kähler forms

Let $I$ be the [[augmentation ideal]], i.e. the kernel of the multiplication map

$$ I := Ker(m:S\otimes_R S\to S)$$

Then $\Omega^1_{S/R}= I/I^2$ and there is a canonical induced map $d: S\to \Omega^1_{S/R}$
given by $d s = [1\otimes s - s\otimes 1]$. 


Similarly, if $R$ is in characteristic zero, one introduces **Kähler $p$-forms** , which are elements of the $p$-th [[exterior power]] $\Omega^p_{S/R}:=\Lambda_R^p \Omega^1_{S/R}$. The [[module]] of Kähler differentials readily generalizes as a [[sheaf]] of Kähler differentials for a separated morphism $f:X\to Y$ of (commutative) [[schemes]], namely it is the [[pullback]] along the embedding of the ideal sheaf of the [[diagonal subobject|diagonal subscheme]] $X\hookrightarrow X\times_Y X$.

Compare the role of [[universal differential envelope]] and [[Amitsur complex]] for  analogous constructions in the noncommutative case. The appropriate extension of the module of relative Kähler differentials to the derived setting is the [[cotangent complex]] of Grothendieck--Illusie.
