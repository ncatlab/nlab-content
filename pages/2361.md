An __inverse limit__ is the same thing as a [[limit]].  (Similarly, a [[direct limit]] is the same thing as a [[colimit]].)  In this context, an __inverse system__ is the same thing as a [[diagram]], and an __inverse cone__ is the same thing as a [[cone]]. If the __indexing category__ is that associated to the natural numbers with its usual order, then an inverse system is often called an __inverse sequence__.

Many authors restrict this terminology to limits over [[codirected sets]] (or [[cofiltered categories]]), especially the codirected set $(\mathbb{N},\geq)$ of [[natural numbers]]. 

$$
  \array{
     && && \lim_{\leftarrow_n} X(x) &&
     \\
     && &\swarrow& \downarrow & \searrow&
     \\
     \cdots & \to & X(2) & \to  & X(1) & \to & X(0)
  }

Classical examples occur in the theory of [[Postnikov towers]] and also in the definition of the [[solenoid]]s.  As an example of the latter the dyadic solenoid is the 'inverse limit' of the **inverse sequence**, $(X(n),p_n)$, in which each $X(n)$ is a copy of $S^1$ and each 'structure map' $p_n:X(n)\to X(n-1)$ is given by the squaring map on the circle, that is $e^{i\theta}\mapsto e^{2i\theta}$.





See [[codirected limit]] (or [[cofiltered limit]]) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.
