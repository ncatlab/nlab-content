An ordinary [[pullback]] is a [[limit]] over a [[diagram]] of the form $A \to C \leftarrow B$.

Accordingly, a _weak pulback_ is a [[weak limit]] over such a diagram.

Depending on how weak limits are interpreted in a given context, weak pullbacks specialice to

* [[homotopy pullback]]

* [[lax pullback]]

* [[comma object]].
