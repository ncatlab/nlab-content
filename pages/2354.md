An ordinary [[pullback]] is a [[limit]] over a [[diagram]] of the form $A \to C \leftarrow B$.  Accordingly, a __2-pullback__ is a [[2-limit]] over such a diagram.

Zoran: I disagree with a second part of the sentence. If it were a 2-limit of THAT diagram strictly speaking we would have from it an arrow to $C$ (which can be skipped in 1-categorical situation as it is superfluous) and several 2-cells in the story. So there is some confusion between sisters like comma objects, 2-pullbacks and alike. 

_Toby_:  It seems to me that (without loss of generality) you can take the arrow to $C$ to be (following the picture below) the composite $P \overset{p}\to A \overset{f}\to C$ (or the composite $P \overset{q}\to B \overset{g}\to C$ if you prefer).  But identifying comma objects with lax pullbacks may be trickier.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I agree with Toby.  The default sense of "2-limit" on the nLab is up to isomorphism everywhere, i.e. what other people call a "bilimit".  In this sense, it is true that a 2-pullback is a 2-limit of a simple cospan; the distinction between iso-comma objects and pseudopullbacks disappears in the world of bilimits, where the limit is only characterized up to equivalence.

Comma objects, however, are never the same as lax pullbacks, except of course in a (2,1)-category.

Zoran: giving in some version of 2-categories the same vertex (of 2-limit) or not, it is principal difference that it is not in the definition of 2-cones of such diagrams to force that the arrow to $C$ is the same as the composition $P\to A\to C$ as Toby states. The arrow to $C$ if it were the 2-limit to that diagram would disagree with $P\to A\to C$ by a 2-cell. Thus the arrow $P\to C$ is a separate datum to include in that case. So the definitions are different. Now, depending on weather we have pseudo, lax, colax, or bilimit this may have or may have not repercussions on the outcome for the vertex of the 2-limit, but this is less important.

## Definition

Explicitly, a 2-pullback in a [[2-category]] is a square
$$\array{P & \overset{p}{\to} &A \\
  ^q\downarrow & \cong & \downarrow^f\\
  B& \underset{g}{\to} &C }$$
which commutes up to [[isomorphism]], and which is universal among such squares in a 2-categorical sense.  This means that (1) given any other such square
$$\array{Z & \overset{r}{\to} &A \\
  ^s\downarrow & \cong & \downarrow^f\\
  B& \underset{g}{\to} &C }$$
which commutes up to isomorphism, there exists a morphism $u:Z\to P$ and isomorphisms $p u \cong r$ and $q u \cong s$ which are coherent with the given ones above, and (2) given any two morphisms $u,v:Z\to P$ and 2-cells $\alpha:p u \to p v$ and $\beta:q u \to q v$ such that $f \alpha = g \beta$ (modulo the given isomorphism $f p \cong g q$), there exists a unique 2-cell $\gamma:u\to v$ such that $p \gamma = \alpha$ and $q \gamma = \beta$.


## Variations

If we are in a [[strict 2-category]] and all the coherence isomorphisms are required to be identities and $u$ in (1) is required to be unique, then we obtain the notion of a **strict 2-pullback**, which is an example of a [[strict 2-limit]].  Obviously not every 2-pullback is a strict 2-pullback, but also not every strict 2-pullback is a 2-pullback, although the latter is true if either $f$ or $g$ is an [[isofibration]] (and in particular if either is a [[Grothendieck fibration]]).  A strict 2-pullback is, in particular, an ordinary pullback in the underlying 1-category of our strict 2-category, but it has a stronger universal property than this, referring to 2-cells as well.

If the coherence isomorphisms in the squares are retained, but in (1) the isomorphisms $p u \cong r$ and $q u \cong s$ are required to be identities and $u$ is required to be unique, we obtain the notion of a **strict iso-comma object** (so named because if the isomorphisms in the squares are then replaced by mere morphisms, we obtain the notion of strict [[comma object]]).  Every strict iso-comma object is a 2-pullback, and many 2-pullbacks (such as those in [[Cat]]) are in fact strict iso-comma objects.

In a [[(2,1)-category]], any [[comma object]] or [[lax pullback]] is also a 2-pullback, but this is not true in general.

2-pullbacks can also be identified with [[homotopy pullbacks]], when the latter are interpreted in $Cat$-enriched homotopy theory.
