#Definition#

Let $C$ and $D$ be [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]], taken in their incarnation as [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]. Then

$$
  Fun(C,D) := SSet(C,D)
$$

is the [[simplicial set]] of morphisms of simplicial sets between $C$ and $D$ (in the standard [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enrichment]] of $SSet$).

The objects in $Fun(C,D)$ are the [[(infinity,1)-functor]]s from $C$ to $D$, the morphisms are the corresponding [[natural transformation]]s, etc.

**Proposition**

$Fun(C,D)$ is indeed a [[quasi-category]].

##Remarks##

* In fact, $Fun(C,D)$ is already a [[quasi-category]] if only $D$ is a [[quasi-category]], where $C$ may be any [[simplicial set]]. This is is useful for instance in the context of the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-presheaves]], as that makes sense already over a domain which is an arbitrary [[simplicial set]].

* For definition of $(\infty,1)$-functors in other models for $(\infty,1)$-categories see [[(infinity,1)-functor]].
