## Idea

Given a [[group]] $G$ and a [[representation]] $V$ of $G$, then any [[subgroup]] inclusion $H\hookrightarrow G$ makes also $H$ [[action|act]] on $G$, this is the _restricted representation_. 

Given an [[irreducible representation]] of $G$, then its decomposition as a [[direct sum]] of irreducible representations of $H$, after restricting the respesentation to $H$, is often called the "branching rule" of the restriction.

More generally, for any group [[homomorphism]] $H \to G$ representations of $G$ "pull back" to representations of $G$.

The [[left adjoint]] to this construction is the operation of forming _[[induced representations]]_, the [[right adjoint]] that of _[[coinduced representations]]_.
