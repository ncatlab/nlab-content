## Idea

The universal [[Thom spectrum]] $MU$ for [[complex vector bundles]].

[[Brown representability theorem|representing]] _complex [[cobordism cohomology theory]]_.

The complex analog of [[MO]]. The underlying non-equivariant theory of [[MR-theory]].

## The $M U$ spectrum 

The spectrum denoted $M U$
is the [[spectrum]] is in degree $2 n$ given by the [[Thom space]] of the [[vector bundle]] that is  [[associated bundle|associated]] by the defining [[representation]] of the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ to the [[generalized universal bundle|universtal]] $U(n)$-[[principal bundle]]:

$$
  M U(2n) = Thom
  \left(
    standard\;associated\;bundle\;to\;universal\;bundle
    \array{
      E U(n) \\ \downarrow \\ B U(n)
    }
  \right)
$$


This is a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] and indeed the universal one among these, see at _[[universal complex orientation on MU]]_.

The _periodic_ complex cobordism theory is given by adding up all the even degree powers of this theory:

$$
  M P = \vee_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \Sigma^{2 n} M U
$$



The [[cohomology ring]] $M P({*})$ is the [[Lazard ring]] which is the universal coefficient ring for [[formal group law]]s.

The [[periodic cohomology theory|periodic]] version is sometimes written $PMU$.



## Properties

### Homotopy groups: Cobordism and Lazard ring

The [[graded ring]] given by evaluating complex cobordism theory on the point is both the complex [[cobordism ring]] as well as the [[Lazard ring]] classifying [[formal group laws]].

+-- {: .num_theorem #RelationToCobordismRing}
###### Theorem

Evaluation of $MU$ on the point yields the complex [[cobordism ring]], whose underlying group is

$$
  \pi_\ast MU \simeq MU_\ast(pt) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, \cdots]
  \,,
$$

where the generator $x_i$ is in degree $2 i$.

=--

This is due to ([Milnor 60](#Milnor60), [Novikov 60](#Novikov60), [Novikov 62](#Novikov62)). A review is in ([Ravenel theorem 1.2.18](#Ravenel), [Ravenel, ch. 3, theorem 3.1.5](#Ravenel)).


The [[formal group law]] associated with $MU$ as with any [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is classified by a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(MU)$ out of the [[Lazard ring]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

This canonical [[homomorphism]] is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  L \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_\bullet(MU)
$$

between the [[Lazard ring]] and the $MU$-[[cohomology ring]], hence by theorem \ref{RelationToCobordismRing} with the complex [[cobordism ring]].

=--

This is [[Quillen's theorem on MU]].
(e.g [Lurie 10, lect. 7, theorem 1](#LurieLect7))


### Universal complex orientation on $M U$
 {#UniversalComplexOrientation}

There is a canonical [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] on $MU$ obtained from the map

$$
  \omega : \mathbb{C}P^\infty \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  M U(1)
  \;\;\;\;
  M U(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)
$$


For $E$ an [[E-infinity ring]] there is a [[bijection]] between [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]] of $E$ and [[E-infinity ring]] maps of the form

$$
  MU \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

(e.g [Lurie 10, lect. 6, theorem 8](#LurieLect6), [Ravenel, chapter 4, lemma 4.1.13](#Ravenel))

See also at _[[complex orientation and MU]]_.


### $MU$-homology of a manifold: Cobordisms in $X$

For $X$ a [[manifold]], the [[group]] $MU_\ast(X)$ is the group of equivalence classes of maps $\Sigma \to X$ from manifolds $\Sigma$ with [[complex structure]] on the stable [[normal bundle]], modulo suitable complex [[cobordisms]].

e.g ([Ravenel chapter 1, section 2](#Ravenel))

(...)



### $MU$-homology of $MU$: Hopf algebroid structure on dual Steenrod algebra

Moreover, the dual $MU$-[[Steenrod algebra]] $MU_\bullet(MU)$
forms a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] over the [[Lazard ring]]. 
This is the content of the _[[Landweber-Novikov theorem]]_.



### Nilpotence theorem

* [[nilpotence theorem]]

### Snaith's theorem

[[Snaith's theorem]] asserts that the [[periodic complex cobordism spectrum]] is the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] of the [[classifying space]] for stable [[complex vector bundles]] (the classifying space for [[topological K-theory]]) localized at the [[Bott element]] $\beta$:

$$
  PMU \simeq \mathbb{S}[B U][\beta^{-1}]
  \,.
$$

### $p$-Localization and Brown-Peterson spectrum

The [[p-localization]] of $MU$ decomoses into the 
[[Brown-Peterson spectra]].
