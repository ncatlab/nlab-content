There are few mutually unrelated notions denoted by "crystal" in mathematics. One can of course talk about mathematical models of physical crystals and their geometry, this will presumably not be a subject of attention in $n$lab. Another, is an intermediary notion leading to [[crystal basis|crystal bases]] of [[Kashiwara]] and of Lusztig, thus one associates a crystal to a [[quantized enveloping algebra]]. Finally, there are **crystals due Grothendieck** to which this entry is dedicated.

## Idea

[[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]]'s differential calculus is based on the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] thickenings of a diagonal of a space. If one takes a completion than there is a filtration on infinitesimals there. On the other hand, this theory also provides a concept of a [[regular differential operator]] which is also filtered (by the degree). There is a fundemantal duality between the infinitesimals and regular differential operators which is compatible with the two filtrations, in fact the duality is a perfect pairing on each filtered level. This pairing gives for example that a [[D-module]] corresponds to a flat [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on a usual [[quasicoherent sheaf]]. 

Flat connections can infinitesimally be described as [[descent]] data on [[de Rham space]]s called the costratification. There is a [[site]] (the [[crystaline site]]) which formalizes these descent data. It can be expalined in many ways, including the intutive in the sense of infinitesimal elements in a [[scheme]]. 

The **crystals of quasicoherent sheaves** are the [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] of modules over the crystaline site are in correspondence with usual quasicoherent sheaves over the underlying scheme with flat connection. 

But Grothendieck has had not only the descent for quasicoherent sheaves but also for [[affine scheme]]s. This nonlinear version is harder and unlike the descent for quasicoherent sheaves, it does not have a noncommutative generalization. 

>([[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]]: we should find an exact reference from EGA or so for the descent for affine schemes). 

Moreover this has also a crystaline version: **crystals of affine schemes**. This corresponds to a nonlinear version of D-modules, called **D-schemes** . As D-modules correspond to solutions of systems of linear differential equations, D-schemes correspond to systems of nonlinear ones. One has also analytic version (analytic D-spaces).
