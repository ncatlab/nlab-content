## Idea

How do you type check MILL, but with projections rather than matching to eliminate $\otimes$? This page gives algorithmic rules that are intended to do that. [Mike Shulman](#Shulman) showed a not-especially-algorithmic type system based on props, but it doesn't handle linear implication.

## Judgment form

$U \subseteq \Gamma \vdash t\,:\,T\,\Box\,U' \subseteq \Gamma'$

The $\Box$ would ideally be a `\boxtimes`, like in [Allais](#Allais), but that doesn't seem to be available. The observation was that a term is implicitly tensored with the identity on all the unused resources.

$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ are contexts with some natural number of semicolon "scope" delimiters. $U$ and $U'$ are "usage" sets, which are subsets of the (domains of the) respective contexts. In [Allais](#Allais), the usage sets are represented as bit vectors (which is a fine way to implement them). Unlike [Allais](#Allais), the usage before and after are for *different* contexts, because type checking a term generally adds projections to the context as potentially-consumed resources.

The purpose of delimited scopes in the context is to remember by when we must've consumed tensor projections. Currently, only lambda adds a scope delimiter. The current algorithm puts projections in the outermost scope it can get away with. This approach will not work when adding additive connectives.

In the rules, I implicitly coerce a context to the usage set of its entire domain. I use the abbreviation $(\Gamma \mapsto \Gamma')U$ to "weaken" $U$ to include all entries in $\Gamma'$ but not $\Gamma$. Set theoretically speaking: $(\Gamma \mapsto \Gamma')U \coloneqq U \cup (\Gamma' \setminus \Gamma)$.

Some important (intended) properties of the judgment form are that if ($U \subseteq \Gamma \vdash t\,:\,T\,\Box\,U' \subseteq \Gamma'$), then:

* $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ have the same number of delimiters.
* $\Gamma'$ includes all the entries of $\Gamma$, in the same scopes. (So in particular, $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'$.)
* $U' \subseteq (\Gamma \mapsto \Gamma')U$

Note that the context grows while the usage shrinks. Erm, I guess these usage sets are the sets of resources *not* used (and thus available). $(\Gamma \mapsto \Gamma')U$ should be understood as the actual usage indicated by $U \subseteq \Gamma$, in light of the additional resources in $\Gamma'$. So as the type checker proceeds, more resources are known of, but fewer remain available.
