## Idea

Following the general concept of $(n,r)$-[[(n,r)-category|category]], a $(0,1)$-category is (up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]]) a [[poset]] or (up to [[isomorphism of categories|isomorphism]]) a [[proset]].  We may also call this a $1$-[[1-poset|poset]].  This view is an instance of [[negative thinking]].


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[(n,1)-category]] is an [[(∞,1)-category]] such that every [[hom-space|hom ∞-groupoid]] is [[n-truncated|(n-1)-truncated]].

=--

Notice that

* a [[0-truncated]] [[∞-groupoid]] is equivalently a set;

* a [[(-1)-truncated]] [[∞-groupoid]] is either [[contractible]] or [[empty set|empty]].

###### Proposition

An $(0,1)$-category is equivalently a [[poset]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may without restriction assume that every hom-$\infty$-groupoid is in fact a set on the nose. Then since this is [[(-1)-truncated]] it is either empty or the singleton. So there is at most one morphism from any object to any other.

## Extra stuff, structure, property

* A $(0,1)$-category with the structure of a [[site]] is a [[(0,1)-site]]: a [[posite]].

* A $(0,1)$-category with the structure of a [[topos]] is a [[(0,1)-topos]]: a [[Heyting algebra]].

* A $(0,1)$-category with the structure of a [[Grothendieck topos]] is a [[Grothendieck (0,1)-topos]]: a [[frame]] or [[locale]].

* A $(0,1)$-category which is also a [[groupoid]] (that is, every morphism is an isomorphism) is a $(0,0)$-category (which may think of as either a $0$-category or as a $0$-groupoid), which is the same as a [[set]] (up to equivalence) or a [[setoid]] (up to isomorphism).
