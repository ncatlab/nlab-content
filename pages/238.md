[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-04-20 #

* [[Finn Lawler]]:  Replied to Toby at [[minimal logic]], and slightly expanded [[paraconsistent logic]] to incorporate some of our discussion.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added to [[Yoneda lemma]] the following: a word on the proof, two further corollaries, a word on the meaning of the first two corollaries

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Put [[well-order|simulations]] everywhere.  I need to think about this (and read Aczel) some more, but I\'m fairly sure that Mike is right about them.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * started polishing the typesetting at [[bundle gerbe]], but there is still plenty of room for further improvement

  * added a summary list to the section "Example: universes in SET" at [[universe in  a topos]]

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: 

  * Added the correct equivalent definition to [[semi-abelian category]] and deleted the discussion about what it might be.

  * Added another version of [[Cantor's theorem]].

  * Expanded [[extensional relation]] to discuss several possible notions of extensionality, reserving the term 'extensional' for the one that I think is most important (but feel free to disagree).

  * Commented on the right notions of morphism for [[relation]], [[well-founded relation]], [[well-order]], and [[extensional relation]].

* [[David Corfield|David]]:

  * imported Urs' material on [[bundle gerbe]]. nLab doesn't seem to like latex within lists. How do we fix this?

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created [[limits and colimits by example]] for purposes discussed on the blog [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html#c023321) and [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/graphical_category_theory_demo.html#c023323)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Yet more at [[pure set]].  See the pretty pictures!  Or rather ... make them pretty if you know how, for I do not.  (;_;)
   *  Another question for Finn, now at [[minimal logic]].
   *  More correct material at [[pure set]].

# 2009-04-19 #

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve started a dispute at [[paraconsistent logic]].
+--{: .query}
[[Finn Lawler|Finn]]: No, you haven't -- I was wrong.
=--

# 2009-04-18 #

* [[Finn Lawler]]:

  * created [[sequent calculus]] and [[paraconsistent logic]]: just brief explanations and links to Wikipedia.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created a stub for [[differential cohomology]]

# 2009-04-17 #

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[comodule]], [[flat module]], [[cotensor product]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Added information on morphisms to [[relation]], [[extensional relation]], [[well-founded relation]], and [[well-order]].  I hope that all of my claimed theorems are true, in which case I\'m sure that all of my proposed definitions are good.  (^_^)

* [[David Corfield|David]]

  * made a request at Mike's [categorified logic](http://ncatlab.org/michaelshulman/show/categorified+logic)

  * created [[D-module]]

  * created [[coherent logic]]

  * added John's blog exposition to [[induced representation]]. Is the style OK?

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * expanded [[hom-set]] a bit

  * remarked at [[semi-abelian category]] that the now deprecated second equivalent definition was taken directly from the (single) reference we give. I think instead of just removing it we should try to correct it.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[axiom of extensionality]] and [[transitive closure]] while writing the below.
   *  Added the more general definition to [[extensional relation]].  It seems right to me and I can prove that it\'s correct for well-founded relations, but I must admit that I made it up just now.
   *  More details about how to model [[pure set]]s in structural set theory, applying the above.
   *  Wrote [[Cantor's theorem]], including a constructive version from Paul Taylor.

# 2009-04-16 #
* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[Tohoku]], [[quasi-pointed category]], made changes to [[sheafification]],[[additive and abelian categories]], [[torsion]], [[torsion subgroup]]

* [[Mathieu Dupont|Mathieu]]:

  * corrected [[semi-abelian category]] and answered to Mike

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * added some links to [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s latest addition to [[rational homotopy theory]] -- in that context I created [[torsion]] and [[torsion subgroup]]

  * finally created [[exact sequence]] which was requested by a bunch of entries

  * added to the "Idea" section of [[Grothendieck category]] a statement suggesting that these are _precisely_ those additive categories for which sheafification exists. Is that right?

  * [[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]] kindly looked up the definition of AB6-category which was still missing at [[additive and abelian categories]], I put it in now 

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  * I created the next entry in the rational homotopy lexicon series with the ungainly title [[differential graded algebras and differential graded Lie algebras-relationships]]. 

  * I added another viewpoint to [[rational homotopy theory]] which is more in keeping with Quillen's 1969 paper.


* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * created [[GUT]] and [[induced representation]] as places for collection of material currently discussed on the blog

  * included [[Todd Trimble|Todd]]'s proof of MacLane's co-Yoneda into [[co-Yoneda lemma]]

  * tried to bring [[A-infinity-category]] into some shape by adding more introductory discussion and ordering the references a bit -- also have a question

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  * Replied to [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] at [[bar and cobar construction]] (at least I hope the reply goes some way to answering the query).

  * Created [[reduced suspension]] as I needed it for my 'reply' above.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * replied to [[David Roberts|David]] at [[ind-object]]

  * have a request and a question at [[bar and cobar construction]]

* [[David Roberts]]: 

  * Added a comment in section generalizations at [[ind-object]], re comma category.

# 2009-04-15 #
* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[fibered n category]], [[Karoubian category]], [[pseudo-abelian category]] (redirect),  [[Koszul duality]], [[pure motive]], [[Voevodsky motive]], [[motives and dg-categories]] (there needs to be a separate big entry on [[mixed motive]], then [[motivic complexes]], [[standard conjectures]], [[Hodge filtration]] etc.), [[element in abelian category]]; created book-page [[Gray-adjointness-for-2-categories]]; additions and references to [[A-infinity category]], [[dg-category]], [[twisting cochain]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created [[ind-object in an (infinity,1)-category]] 

  * created [[cofinal functor]] and [[cofinally small category]], but just the bare defintion so far

  * expanded [[ind-object]]: added more motivation in "Idea" section, added examples, added list of properties

# 2009-04-14 #

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a discussion to [[universe in a topos]] with more details on how to get back the Grothendieck universe axioms in $SET$. Please check. I'd be grateful for improvement.

  * to Andrew: I think we want here on the $n$Lab as much detail as we can get hold of -- if an entry becomes too long, though, it might be an option to split off entries from it "more details on xyz" or the like and link to them

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew Stacey]]: Added the basic definitions to [[Chen space]] and some of the other variants of [[generalized smooth space|generalised smooth space]].  How much detail do we want on these pages?

* [[Andrew Stacey|The English Pedant]]: I'm not convinced about the use of the word "heuristic" on the n-Lab.  I've started a discussion on the [n-Forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=17) rather than force my views on the English language on the n-Lab.  I realise that this is a little against the Wiki-spirit but I figured that if I went through changing all occurrences of the word "heuristic" then someone would object and we'd have a discussion about it; so to save a bit of agro, I'm instigating the discussion first.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I started a new category, `foundational axiom`, in which I put the pages that contain axioms that one might (or might not) want in one [[foundations]] of mathematics.  That way, anyone with opinions on the matter can check them to see that one\'s views are represented.  (A few don\'t really have much in the way of an axiom right now, but one could be added or noted there.)  This does not include things like the axioms for a [[group]], but rather axioms for [[set theory]] (or other foundational theory).  (Although [[set theory]] itself I don\'t think should really be included, but [[ETCS]] is in there.)

#2009-04-13

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Did some massaging of [[well-order]], [[well-ordering theorem]], [[well-founded relation]], [[choice object]], and [[axiom of choice]], and created [[extensional relation]].

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: completed the definition of [[congruence]].

#2009-04-12

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Today a Hopf algebraist resurrected in me...grrr...[[Hopf action]], [[measuring]], [[Heisenberg double]], [[bimonoid]], [[module algebra]], [[comodule algebra]]. Well, I am writing an article about a special case of a Heisenberg double, maybe that is why.  

#2009-04-11

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[axiom of foundation]], [[well-founded relation]], and [[well-ordering theorem]].
   *  Added to [[successor]], [[inaccessible cardinal]], [[well-order]], [[partial function]], [[ordinal number]], and [[cardinal number]].
   *  Commented on [[direct sum]], [[presentable (infinity,1)-category]], [[stable (infinity,1)-topos]], [[sequential convergence space]], and [[quantale]].
   *  Moved material from [[Cat]] to [[n-category]].
   *  Moved [[ordinal]] to [[ordinal number]], partly because it\'s more noun-like and partly to match [[cardinal number]].
   *  Moved $1$-categorial material from [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category]] to [[compact object]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:  Thanks Finn!  It was great to meet you too.  I sliced up your paragraph mentioning fibrations and incorporated the material in other places where I thought it fit better.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Created [[Frobenius category]]; added material in [[dg-category]] on dg-modules, Yoneda functor and  "pre-triangulated". One should also explain the pre-triangulated envelope functor.

#2009-04-10

*  [[Finn Lawler]]:

   * Created [[minimal logic]] and [[intuitionistic logic]], as very small stubs.  Introduced yet more broken links there, which I'll fill in later.

   * Slightly corrected Mike's new entry [[type theory]], and added a paragraph mentioning fibrations.  I'm not sure it's in the right place, though.  (PS. Mike: it was great to meet you in Cambridge!  Also, Bruce: thanks for finding me a seat in the restaurant!)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I aksed an idle question at [[combinatorial spectrum]] about Kan complexes and $\mathbf{Z}$-groupoids.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: 

  * Created [[type theory]] with an introduction for category-theorists.  Additions and corrections are welcome.

  * Some improvements and corrections to [[cardinal number]], [[ordinal]], [[well-order]] (what an ugly noun!), [[transitive set]], and [[inaccessible cardinal]], and created [[von Neumann hierarchy]].  In particular, I added the structural point of view to complement the naive and material ones.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a reference with a remark to [[A-infinity category]]. Would be nice to have more literature here, and more discussion on the relation to [[dg-category]] and [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] 

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I have made additions to [[cardinal number]]: Urs uses a naive set definition where cardinals are equipotence classes of sets hence his cardinals are proper classes; I follow a choice of representative among ordinals ([[well-order]]ed [[transitive set]]s); to this aim I created [[transitive set]], [[ordinal]], [[successor]], [[inaccessible cardinal]]. In doing this I used some intro parts of my lectures on sheaf theory which I currently teach in Zagreb in Croatian (and which initially started with cardinals, universes and categories). I created [[twisting function]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a remark on the $(\infty,1)$-version at [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]


  * created [[accessible (infinity,1)-category]] and [[accessible (infinity,1)-category]], but incomplete

  * created [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category]], but incomplete

  * created [[cardinal number]] and [[well-order]], but experts should please check these

  * created [[sigma-model]]

  * created an entry [[geometric infinity-function theory]] to go along with the $n$Caf&eacute; entry [Journal Club -- Geometric Infinity-Function Theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html)

  * created [[natural numbers object]] just to saturate links (and it should indeed be "natural numbers object", not "natural number object", agreed?)

  * worked comment by [[David Ben-Zvi]] into [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]], but more needs to be done

#2009-04-09

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * I had been asked by students to say something about why they should care about learning about $(\infty,1)$-categories. I thought that would be a good thing to try to answer in an $n$Lab entry, so I started an entry [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]]. This is just a first attempt. Maybe somebody would enjoy adding his or her own points of views of correcting/improving mine.

  * created [[Connes fusion]], but filled in only pointers to further references

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[von Neumann algebra]] emphasising on sources of relations to category theory and low dimensional topology (particularly G. Segal's program on relations between CFT and elliptic cohomology). There is a good wikipedia entry on von Neumann algebras with lost of references and details, but neglecting the connection to the above topics which should be expanded on. Moreover somebody should mayve write entres on related topics as [[Connes fusion]], [[modular functor]] etc. as those are relevant for some of us.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I came to some sort of decision at [[direct sum]].

#2009-04-08

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  attempted a (long-winded) reply to [[David Corfield|David]]s question "What does it mean" at [[Coyoneda lemma]] (and would anyone mind if we renamed that to [[coYoneda lemma]]?)

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: 

  * Following Toby's suggestion, moved [[subsequential space]] to [[sequential convergence space]].  Split [[convergence space]] and [[Cauchy space]] off from [[filter]], and added some stuff about pseudotopological spaces to [[convergence space]].

  * Created [[Reedy category]].

* [[David Corfield|David]]: Created [[Coyoneda lemma]]. What does it mean?

#2009-04-07

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Created [[subsequential space]] with a bit of propaganda.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I created entries [[orbit category]], [[Dold-Thom theorem]] and [[satellite]] with most basic definitions, properties and references, but quickly run out of energy; one should at least add the definition of the morphism part of the satellite functors, the connecting morphism for long exact sequence of satellites, and connection to the Kan extensions. Made some additions to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I have a terminological question at [[direct sum]].  (It\'s a rather elementary question in universal algebra.)

#2009-04-06

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created [[Deligne cohomology]]

  * reacted to [[Bruce Bartlett|Bruce]]'s question at [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] by expanding further on the notion of morphisms of sheaves

  * expanded slightly at [[AQFT]] -- still just a stub entry, though

  * touched [[combinatorial spectrum]]: replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], expanded the discussion of examples and changed the notation there a bit. But please check. I'll send a request about this to the blog.

  * replied to [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s comments on [[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]]'s comment at [[differential graded Lie algebra]]

  * replied to the questions that were at [[restriction and extension of sheaves]] (on notation and existence) by adding more details

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have adjusted an addition to [[differential graded Lie algebra]]. This used the term 'simply', but it is often not clear that one definition is 'simpler' than another.  'Simplicity' is sometimes clear, but is often in the eye of the beholder. I would love to see some discussion on this as it is an easy trap to fall into (as I know to my cost!) and there are several other similar traps out there which are just as difficult to avoid! Perhaps on the café???


#2009-04-05

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a few links to examples at [[space and quantity]] (we have a general problem that many entries created eraly on don't currently point to entries created more recently which de facto they should point to)

  * touched [[combinatorial spectrum]]: replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], added a list of examples and have further questions

#2009-04-04

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[bar and cobar construction]]. This looks at the differential algebra behind those constructions, and sketches the bar-cobar adjunction. 

  *  I have tried to provide more links to and from this series of 'lexicon' entries. (soon will be finished!)



* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * further polished [[nonabelian cohomology]]

  * created [[combinatorial spectrum]]

  * expanded [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]

  * created [[cohomology]]

  * created [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]]

#2009-04-03

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * added a bit more details to [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]

  * added discussion of the sheaf version to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * started an entry [[abelian sheaf cohomology]], but have just the "Idea"-section so far (aiming to provide the right $\infty$-categorical perspective)

  * provided, using [[Todd Trimble|Todd]]'s help, the details on the relations between the two definitions at [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]] and created a supplementary entry [[functors and comma categories]] on properties of, well, functors on comma categories


#2009-04-02

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded Hopf algebra]]. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * reorganized the entry [[mathematics]] a bit -- I am hoping that eventually this becomes a useful top of a small hierarchy of link-list entries which allow the reader to get an idea of the scope of topics covered (and not yet covered) by the $n$Lab, and possibly to facilitate searches by topic rather than by keyword

  * as discussed with [[Timothy Porter]], I created a stub for [[rational homotopy theory]] whose main purpose at the moment is to contain the link list to his lexicon entries on concepts in differential graded algebra

  * created [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]] and [[closed monoidal structure on sheaves]], but am being dense: have a question at the former

  * created [[direct image]] and [[inverse image]] and [[restriction and extension of sheaves]]

  * moved discussion from [[semi-abelian category]] to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] and added references

  * added explicit formulas to [[Yoneda extension]] (not the [[end]]-yoga, though)

  * added a question to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s question at [[semi-abelian category]] (probably for [[Tim Porter|Tim]])

  * polished [[infinity-topos]]

#2009-04-01

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * prodded by [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s latest comment at [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] I looked up and then created an  entry for [[semi-abelian category]]

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: (I seem to remember a request to put more recent changes at the top, even if you have one on today's page so ... .)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded Lie algebra]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[infinity-stackification]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[abelian sheaf]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * created [[injective object]]

  * created [[complex]]

  * created [[Grothendieck category]] -- it feels like this should make me say something about that axiom list at [[additive and abelian categories]]...

  * tried to resolve/incorporate parts of the discussion at [[localization]] by reworking the entry a bit -- also left a comment there

  * noticed that we have considerable overlap now between [[multiplicative system]] and [[category of fractions]]. Left a comment there to remind us. Somebody who knows the precise status of these two terms in the math community should please go ahead and merge the material in one entry, keeping a redirect page for the respective other term

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  * I have added a comment on the terminology [[localization]]. Perhaps an algebraic geometric historical perspective could be useful here to help explain the terminology. (I'm not sure that I am competent to provide this however!)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded coalgebra]].

* [[David Roberts]]:

  * Added [[bicategory of fractions]], [[category of fractions]] and [[wide subcategory]].
  * Started adding the construction of the [[localization]] of a category, as well as a speculative comment at that page on computing this as a [[fundamental category]].

  * Migrated [[2009 March changes|March changes]] 

  * Continued discussion with Urs at my private page [[davidroberts:comments on chapter 2]].
