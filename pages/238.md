[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

#2009-04-02

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded Hopf algebra]]. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * reorganized the entry [[mathematics]] a bit -- I am hoping that eventually this becomes a useful top of a small hierarchy of link-list entries which allow the reader to get an idea of the scope of topics covered (and not yet covered) by the $n$Lab, and possibly to facilitate searches by topic rather than by keyword

  * as discussed with [[Timothy Porter]], I created a stub for [[rational homotopy theory]] whose main purpose at the moment is to contain the link list to his lexicon entries on concepts in differential graded algebra

  * created [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]] and [[closed monoidal structure on sheaves]], but am being dense: have a question at the former

  * created [[direct image]] and [[inverse image]] and [[restriction and extension of sheaves]]

  * moved discussion from [[semi-abelian category]] to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] and added references

  * added explicit formulas to [[Yoneda extension]] (not the [[end]]-yoga, though)

  * added a question to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s question at [[semi-abelian category]] (probably for [[Tim Porter|Tim]])

  * polished [[infinity-topos]]

#2009-04-01

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * prodded by [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s latest comment at [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] I looked up and then created an  entry for [[semi-abelian category]]

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: (I seem to remember a request to put more recent changes at the top, even if you have one on today's page so ... .)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded Lie algebra]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[infinity-stackification]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[abelian sheaf]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * created [[injective object]]

  * created [[complex]]

  * created [[Grothendieck category]] -- it feels like this should make me say something about that axiom list at [[additive and abelian categories]]...

  * tried to resolve/incorporate parts of the discussion at [[localization]] by reworking the entry a bit -- also left a comment there

  * noticed that we have considerable overlap now between [[multiplicative system]] and [[category of fractions]]. Left a comment there to remind us. Somebody who knows the precise status of these two terms in the math community should please go ahead and merge the material in one entry, keeping a redirect page for the respective other term

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  * I have added a comment on the terminology [[localization]]. Perhaps an algebraic geometric historical perspective could be useful here to help explain the terminology. (I'm not sure that I am competent to provide this however!)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded coalgebra]].

* [[David Roberts]]:

  * Added [[bicategory of fractions]], [[category of fractions]] and [[wide subcategory]].
  * Started adding the construction of the [[localization]] of a category, as well as a speculative comment at that page on computing this as a [[fundamental category]].

  * Migrated [[2009 March changes|March changes]] 

  * Continued discussion with Urs at my private page [[davidroberts:comments on chapter 2]].
