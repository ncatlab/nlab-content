In [[algebraic geometry]] one can glue [[affine scheme]]s in various topologies; this way one obtains various kinds of locally affine [[ringed space]]s. For example, [[scheme]]s locally affine in [[Zariski topology]]. [[étale topology|Étale topology]] is finer than Zariski, hence the category of locally affine (ringed) spaces in étale topology is larger than the category of schemes. __Algebraic spaces__ make a category which is between the category of schemes and category of locally affine spaces in étale topology, namely those ringed spaces which may be obtained as a [[quotient]] of a scheme $S$ by an [[equivalence relation]] $R\subset S\times S$ which is a closed subscheme, and whose projections $p_1,p_2: R\to S$ are étale morphisms of schemes.
