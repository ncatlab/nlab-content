[[!redirects tropical rig]]
The __tropical rig__ is a [[rig]] $(\mathbb{R}\cup \{\infty\}, \oplus,\otimes)$ with addition $x\oplus y = min(x,y)$  and multiplication $x\otimes y = x+y$.

The __tropical semiring__ is a [[semiring]] $(\mathbb{R},\oplus,\otimes)$ with addition $x\oplus y = min(x,y)$  and multiplication $x\otimes y = x+y$.

[[tropical geometry|Tropical geometry]] is often thought as the algebraic geometry over the tropical semiring.
