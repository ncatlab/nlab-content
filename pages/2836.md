## Definition

In a [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ admitting a [[final object]] ${*}$, for any object $X$ its **suspension object** $\Sigma X$ is the [[homotopy pullback|homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
     X &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\to& \Sigma X
  }
  \,,
$$

This is the [[mapping cone]] of the terminal map $X \to {*}$. See there for more details.

This concept is dual to that of [[loop space object]].

## Suspension functor

### As an (infinity,1)-functor

Let $C$ be a [[pointed (infinity,1)-category]].  Write $M^\Sigma$ for the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[pushout|cocartesian squares]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\to& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $X$ and $Y$ are [[objects]] of $C$.  Supposing that $C$ admits [[cofibres]] of all [[morphisms]], then one sees that the functor $M^\Sigma \to C$ given by evaluation at the initial vertex ($X$) is a [[trivial fibration]].  Hence it admits a [[section]] $s : C \to M^\Sigma$.  Then the **suspension functor** $\Sigma_C : C \to C$ is the [[composite]] of $s$ with the functor $M^\Sigma \to C$ given by evaluating at the final vertex ($Y$).

$\Sigma_C$ is [[left adjoint]] to the [[loop space functor]] $\Omega_C$.

### As an ordinary functor

Let $C$ be a [[category]] admitting small [[colimits]].  Let $\Phi$ be a [[graded monoid]] in the [[category]] of [[groups]] and $F : C \to C$ a $\Phi$-symmetric [[endofunctor]] of $C$ that commutes with small [[colimits]].  Let $Spect_F^{\Phi}(C)$ denote the [[category]] of $\Phi$-symmetric $F$-[[spectrum objects]] in $C$.

Following [Ayoub](#Ayoub), the [[evaluation]] functor
  $$ Ev^n : Spect_F^{\Phi}(C) \to C, $$
which "evaluates" a symmetric spectrum at its $n$th component, admits under these assumptions a [[left adjoint]]
  $$ Sus^n : C \to \Spect_F^\Phi(C) $$
called the $n$th **suspension functor**, more commonly denoted $\Sigma_C^{\infty-n}$.

When $C$ is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]], and in the case $\Phi = \Sigma$ and $F = T \otimes -$ for some object $T$, there is an induced [[symmetric monoidal structure]] on $Spect^\Sigma_T(C)$ as described at [[symmetric monoidal structure on spectrum objects]].

**Proposition.** One has
  $$ Sus^p_T(X) \otimes Sus^q_T(Y) \simeq Sus^{p+q}_T(X \otimes Y) $$
for all $X,Y \in C$.  In particular, $Sus = Sus^0 : C \to \Spect^\Sigma_T(C)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]].

## Examples

* In [[Top]], this is the [[reduced suspension]] of a space.

* In a [[category of chain complexes]] the [[suspension of a chain complex]] is given by shifting the degrees of the chain complex up by one.
