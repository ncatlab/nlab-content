## Definition

An **algebraic number** is a [[root]] of a [[polynomial]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]] (or, equivalently, with [[rational number|rational]] coeffients).

Since the [[rational numbers]] are a [[subfield]] of the [[complex numbers]], and since the [[complex numbers]] are an [[algebraically closed field]], algebraic numbers are naturally regarded as a sub-field of [[complex numbers]]

Points becomes smaller as the integer polynomial coefficients become larger. View shows integers 0,1 and 2 at bottom right, $+i$ near top.

But the collection of all algebraic numbers forms itself already an [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] [[field]], typically denoted $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, as this is the [[algebraic closure]] of the field $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]]. The [[absolute Galois group]] $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}, \mathbb{Q})$ is peculiar, see [there](absolute+Galois+group#OfTheRationalNumbers).




A number (especially a [[complex number]]) which is *not* algebraic is called __transcendental__; famous examples are the base ($\mathrm{e} = 2.7\ldots $) and period ($2 \pi \mathrm{i} = 6.28\ldots \mathrm{i}$, or equivalently $\pi = 3.14\ldots $) of the [[natural logarithm]].

An [[algebraic integer]] is a root of a [[monic polynomial]] with integer coefficients. Given a [[field]] $k$ the (algebraic) __[[number field]]__ $K = k[P]$ over $k$ is the minimal [[field]] containing all the roots of a given polynomial $P$ with coefficients in $k$. Usually one considers algebraic number fields over rational numbers.
