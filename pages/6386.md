## Definition

An **algebraic number** is a [[root]] of a [[polynomial]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]] (or, equivalently, with [[rational number|rational]] coeffients). Equivalently, an element $\alpha$ of a [[field extension]] $K$ of the [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is *algebraic* if the [[subfield]] $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is a finite degree [[field extension|extension]], i.e., is [[finite dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. 

Since the [[rational numbers]] are a [[subfield]] of the [[complex numbers]], and since the [[complex numbers]] are an [[algebraically closed field]], algebraic numbers are naturally regarded as a sub-field of [[complex numbers]]

But the collection of all algebraic numbers forms itself already an [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] [[field]], typically denoted $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, as this is the [[algebraic closure]] of the field $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]]. This also follows easily from the equivalent definition of algebraic numbers in terms of finite degree extensions. The [[absolute Galois group]] $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}, \mathbb{Q})$ is peculiar, see [there](absolute+Galois+group#OfTheRationalNumbers).

A number (especially a [[complex number]]) which is *not* algebraic is called __transcendental__; famous examples are the base ($\mathrm{e} = 2.7\ldots $) and period ($2 \pi \mathrm{i} = 6.28\ldots \mathrm{i}$, or equivalently $\pi = 3.14\ldots $) of the natural [[logarithm]].

Given a [[field]] $k$, an algebraic __[[number field]]__ $K$ over $k$ is a finite-degree extension of $k$. By default, the term "algebraic number field" means an algebraic number field over the rational numbers. If $\alpha$ is an algebraic number over $\mathbb{Q}$ then $\mathbb{Q}[\alpha]$ is a __[[number field]]__, however the field of all algebraic numbers is *not* a __[[number field]]__.

An [[algebraic integer]] is a root of a [[monic polynomial]] with integer coefficients. Equivalently, an element $\alpha$ of a field extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ is an algebraic integer if the [[ring]] $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is of finite [[rank]] as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module. It follows easily from this characterization that the collection of all algebraic integers forms a commutative ring.
