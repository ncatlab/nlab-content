## Definition

An **algebraic number** is a [[root]] of a [[polynomial]] [[equation]] with [[integer]] coefficients (or, equivalently with [[rational number|rational]] coeffients). 

An [[algebraic integer]] is a root of a [[monic polynomial]] with integer coefficients. Given a [[field]] $k$ a (algebraic) __[[number field]]__ $K = k[P]$ over $k$ is the minimal [[field]] containing all the roots of a given polynomial $P$ with coefficients in $k$. Usually one considers algebraic number fields over rational numbers.
