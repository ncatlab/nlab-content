## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], a _dependent product type_ $\prod_{x\colon A} B(x)$, for a [[dependent type]] $x\colon A\vdash B(x)\colon Type$ is the [[type]] of "dependently typed [[functions]]" assigning to each $x\colon A$ an element of $B(x)$.

In a [[model]] of the type theory in [[categorical semantics]], this is a [[dependent product]].  In [[set theory]], it is an element of an indexed product.

It includes [[function types]] as the special case when $B$ is not dependent on $A$.  Note that a binary [[product type]] is rather different, being actually a special case of a [[dependent sum type]].

## Definition

Dependent products are almost always defined as a [[negative type]].
