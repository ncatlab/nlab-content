The deRham theorem asserts that the [[deRham cohomology]] $H^n_{dR}(X)$ of a smooth [[manifold]] $X$ (without boundary) is isomorphic to the "ordinary" $\mathbb{R}$-valued cohomology, i.e. the singular or Čech cohomology with real coefficients $H^n(X, \mathbb{R})$. The theorem has several dozens of different proofs. For example in Čech approach one can make a double complex whose first row is the Čech complex of a covering and first column is the de Rham complex and other entries are mixed and use spectral sequence argument (see the textbook of Bott and Tu, or the geometry lectures book by Postnikov, semester III). 
 

This is maybe best formulated, understood and proven in the context of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]:

Write $\mathbb{R}_c$ for 

* the abelian group $\mathbb{R}$ 

* regarded not as a [[Lie group]] with the standard [[manifold]] structure on $\mathbb{R}$ but as a topologically discrete group on the underlying set of $\mathbb{R}$

* and then regarded as a [[sheaf]] on $X$: the constant sheaf that sends $U \subset X$ to the set of _constant_ maps $U \to \mathbb{R}$, i.e.

* $\mathbb{R}_c : U \mapsto \mathbb{R}$.

Write $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c$ for the corresponding [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]] in [[chain complex]]es of sheaves of abelian groups: this is the complex of sheaves with $\mathbb{R}_c$ in degree $n$:

$$
  \mathbb{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c
  = 
  (\cdots \to 0 \to \mathbb{R}_c \to 0 \to \cdots \to 0) 
  \,.
$$ 

Next, write $\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ (without the subscript $c$!) for the [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne complex]] for $\mathbb{R}$

$$
  \bar \mathbb{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c
  = 
  (C^\infty(-,\mathbb{R}) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
    \Omega^1(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
    \Omega^2(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \cdots \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \Omega^n_{closed}(-)) 
  \,.
$$ 

(The notation here is borrowed from that used at [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]]: we can think of $\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ as a differential refinement of the object $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$).

Then we have:

* "ordinary" $\mathbb{R}$-valued cohomology of $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c$.

* [[deRham cohomology]] of $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in $\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c$ (this is semi-obvious, requires a bit more discussion).

* the [[Poincare lemma]] says that every closed [[differential form]] is locally exact, and hence there is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of chain complexes of sheaves

  $$
    \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}
  $$

  given by injecting for each $U \subset X$ the set $\mathbb{R}$ as the constant functions into $C^\infty(U,\mathbb{R})$.

It is this quasi-isomorphism of coefficient objects that induces the deRham isomorphism of [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian sheaf]] [[cohomology group]]s, which is ordinarily written as

$$
  H^n(X,\mathbb{R}) \simeq 
  H^n_{dR}(X)
  \,.
$$
