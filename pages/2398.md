The deRham theorem asserts that for $X$ a smooth [[manifold]] the [[deRham cohomology]] $H^n_{dR}(X)$ is isomorphic to the "ordiary" $\mathbb{R}$-valued cohomologhy $H^n(X, \mathbb{R})$.

This is best formulated, understood and proven in the context of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]:

Write $\mathbb{R}_c$ for 

* the abelian group $\mathbb{R}$ 

* regarded not as a [[Lie group]] with the standard [[manifold]] structure on $\mathbb{R}$ but as a topologically discrete group on the underlying set of $\mathbb{R}$

* and then regarded as a [[sheaf]] on $X$: the constant sheaf that sends $U \subset X$ to the set of _constant_ maps $U \to \mathbb{R}$, i.e.

* $\mathbb{R}_c : U \mapsto \mathbb{R}$.

Write $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c$ for the corresponding [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]] in [[chain complex]]es of sheaves of abelian groups: this is the complex of sheaves with $\mathbb{R}_c$ in degree $n$:

$$
  \mathbb{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c
  = 
  (\cdots \to 0 \to \mathbb{R}_c \to 0 \to \cdots \to 0) 
  \,.
$$ 

Next, write $\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ (without the subscript $c$!) for the [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne complex]] for $\mathbb{R}$

$$
  \bar \mathbb{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c
  = 
  (C^\infty(-,\mathbb{R}) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
    \Omega^1(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
    \Omega^2(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \cdots \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \Omega^n_{closed}(-)) 
  \,.
$$ 

(The notation here is borrowed from that used at [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]]: we can think of $\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ as a differential refinement of the object $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$).

Then we have:

* "ordinary" $\mathbb{R}$-valued cohomology of $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c$.

* [[deRham cohomology]] of $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in $\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c$ (this is semi-obvious, requires a bit more discussion).

* the [[Poincare lemma]] says that every closed [[differential form]] is locally exact, and hence there is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of chain complexes of sheaves

  $$
    \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}
  $$

  given by injecting for each $U \subset X$ the set $\mathbb{R}$ as the constant functions into $C^\infty(U,\mathbb{R})$.

It is this quasi-isomorphism of coefficient objects that induces the deRham isomorphism of [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian sheaf]] [[cohomology group]]s, which is ordinarily written as

$$
  H^n(X,\mathbb{R}) \simeq 
  H^n_{dR}(X)
  \,.
$$
