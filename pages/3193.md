## Definition

For an [[operator]] between [[Banach spaces]], compactness is a natural strengthening of [[bounded operator|continuity]] (boundedness). A linear operator is **compact** if it sends the [[bounded subspace|bounded subsets]] to [[relatively compact subset|relatively compact subsets]]. 


## Properties

Since every relatively compact subspace (in a Banach space, or indeed in any [[metric space]]) is bounded, every compact operator is bounded. Instead of checking compactness on all bounded subsets it is sufficient to check it for a [[ball]] of one fixed radius: an operator is compact iff it sends the ball of unit radius to a relatively compact set.

See also [[compact self-adjoint operator]].


## Completely continuous operators

In the setup of [[Hilbert spaces]], instead of a compact operator, one sometimes says a completely continuous operator. However, in the full generality of Banach spaces, by a **completely continuous operator** one means slightly less: an operator that maps every [[weak convergence|weakly convergent]] sequence to a [[norm convergence|norm convergent]] sequence. For Hilbert spaces and, more generally, for [[reflexive Banach spaces]], the two notions are equivalent.
