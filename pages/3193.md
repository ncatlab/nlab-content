For an operator between [[Banach spaces]], compactness is a natural strengthening of continuity (boundedness). A linear operator is **compact** if it sends the [[bounded subspace|bounded subsets]] to [[relatively compact subset|relatively compact subsets]]. 

In particular every compact operator is bounded. Instead of checking compactness on all bounded subsets it is sufficient to check it for a ball of one fixed radius: an operator is compact iff it sends the ball of unit radius to a relatively compact set.

In the setup of [[Hilbert spaces]], instead of a compact operator, one sometimes says a completely continuous operator. However, in the full generality of Banach spaces, by a **completely continuous operator** one means slightly less: an operator that maps every weakly convergent sequence to a norm convergent sequence. For Hilbert spaces and, more generally, for [[reflexive Banach spaces]], the two notions are equivalent.
