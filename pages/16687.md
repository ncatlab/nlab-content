(**Historical note:** The version linked to above is a handwritten draft copy, with some annotations by someone (perhaps Grothendieck). A typed version does exist which does not contain the preliminary material in the first file. The date of the official thesis defense was 22 May 1975, with Verdier, Cartan, L. Schwartz and Zisman as well as Grothendieck as the 'jury'. It was a 'doctorat d'etat'.)
