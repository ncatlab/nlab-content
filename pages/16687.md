(**Historical note:** The version linked to above is a handwritten draft copy, with some annotations by someone (perhaps Grothendieck). A typed version does exist which does not contain the preliminary material in the first file. The date of the official thesis defense was 22 May 1975, with [[Jean-Louis Verdier|Verdier]], [[Henri Cartan|Cartan]], L. Schwartz and Zisman as well as [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] as the 'jury'. It was a 'doctorat d'état'. The link to her thesis contains other material like a collection of remarks by Grothendieck on her work as well as two articles by Sính related to the subject of her thesis)
