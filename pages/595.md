## Definition

An **intersection** is a [[meet]] of [[subset]]s or (more generally) [[subobject]]s.

The dual notion is that of [[union]]/[[join]].

This includes the traditional [[set theory|set-theoretic]] intersection of subsets of some ambient set; intersections of completely arbitrary sets are considered [[evil]].

In a [[finitely complete category]], the intersection of two [[monomorphism]]s $A\hookrightarrow X$ and $B\hookrightarrow X$ can be computed by a [[pullback]] of the [[cospan]] $A\to X \leftarrow B$.
