#Idea#

According to the general pattern on [[(n,r)-category]], an $(\infty,1)$-category is a (weak) [[infinity-category]] in which all $n$-morphisms for $n \geq 2$ are [[equivalence]]s.

To some extent an $(\infty,1)$-category can be thought of as a [[enriched category|category enriched in]] [[(infinity,0)-category|(infinity,0)]]-categories, namely in [[infinity-groupoid]]s.

For a discussion of the motivation and purpose of $(\infty,1)$-categories see [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]].


#Definition#

By definition, the [[model category]] of $(\infty,1)$-categories is one which is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to any one of

 * [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]];

 * [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]];

 * [[Segal category|Segal categories]];

 * [[complete Segal space]]s;
