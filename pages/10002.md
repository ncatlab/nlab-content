## Properties

A [[topological field theory|topological]] [[FQFT]]-formulation of Donaldson theory is supposed to be given as a [[functor]] from a suitable [[symplectic category]] of [[symplectic manifolds]] with [[Lagrangian correspondences]] between them which sends a [[symplectic manifold]] to its [[Fukaya category]]. For more on this see at _[[Lagrangian correspondences and category-valued TFT]]_.
