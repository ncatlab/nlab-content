## Definition

For $C$ a [[regular category]] the _regular coverage_ on $C$ is the [[coverage]] whose [[covering]] families consist of single [[regular epimorphism]]s.

The [[Grothendieck topology]] generated from this is called the _regular topology_ .

[[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] [[Grothendieck topology]] whose covering families are generated by single [[regular epimorphisms]]: the [[regular coverage]].  

## Properties

* If $C$ is [[exact category|exact]] or has pullback-stable [[reflexive coequalizer]]s, then its [[codomain fibration]] is a [[stack]] for this topology (the necessary and sufficient condition is that any pullback of a kernel pair is again a kernel pair).

* For $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ the [[syntactic category]] of a [[regular theory]], the regular coverage makes it the [[syntactic site]], which is a site of defininition for the [[classifying topos]] of $\mathcal{T}$.
