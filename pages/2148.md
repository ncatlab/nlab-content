The subject of [[cohomology]] with local coefficients ([[twisted cohomology]]) begins with Reidemeister in his study of lens spaces in 193?. He considered the cohomology of a manifold $M$ in terms of cochains of the universal covering space $U$ together with the action of the fundamental group of $M$ as deck transformations. His terminology was _Überdeckung_ which refers to ???

Steenrod in 1942 independently generalized the concept of ordinary cohomology to *cohomology with coefficients in a local system of groups*, later known as *cohomology with local coefficients*. In 1943, he acknowledged Reidemeister's precedence  showing that (after a suitable interpretation) the theory includes Reidemeister's concept of Überdeckung.

In 1947, Eilenberg showed that the cohomology theory with a local system of groups is naturally equivalent to a theory of equivariants with respect to the [[deck transformation]]s of cohomology with ordinary coefficients on the corresponding universal [[covering space]].

In 1950, Olum extended Eilenberg's [[obstruction]] theory to the non-simple case, i.e. when the [[fundamental group]] acts non-trivially on the higher [[homotopy group]]s involved.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, there were several papers addressing operations on cohomology with local coefficients:

* 1963, Gitler (Steenrod mod $p$), _Cohomology operations with twisted coefficients_, AJM 85 (1963)156--188

* 1966, McClendon, thesis -- summarized in

* 1967, Emery Thomas, tc ops

* 1967, Larmore, tc ops

* 1969, McClendon, _Higher order twisted cohomology operations_, Invent. Math. 7 (1969) 183--214

* 1969, Larmore, tc

* 1970, Peterson, tc ops

* 1971, McClendon, tc ops

In 1972, the phrase _twisted cohomology_ was  used by Larmore to describe 
$H(-; \mathcal{E})$, cohomology with coefficients in a special kind of [[spectrum]] $\mathcal{E}$  related to a [[fibration]] $p:E\to B.$ The result is what May and Sigurdsson call a parameterized spectrum,
the _parameters_ being the points of $B$, which might also be called, in the older topological terminology, an _ex-spectrum_.

In recent years, especially after  the invention of [[twisted K-theory]], 'twisted cohomology' has become the generic term, including not only twisted [[generalized (Eilenberg–Steenrod) cohomology]] but even what is known as twisted _[[nonabelian cohomology|non-abelian]]_ cohomolgy. Among other things, non-abelian refers to the fact 
that no spectrum need be involved, but only a single target space, preferably at least a [[loop space]].

Also in 1972 Robinson constructed Moore--[[Postnikov system]]s for non-simple fibrations. In particular, he
provided twisted $K(\pi,n)$s corresponding to cohomology with local coefficients.
