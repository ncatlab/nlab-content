## Idea


By [[pseudo-differential operator|pseudo-differential analysis]] an [[elliptic operator]] acting on [[sections]] of two [[vector bundles]] on a [[manifold]] is a [[Fredholm operator]] and hence has closed [[kernel]] and [[cokernel]] of finite [[dimension]]. The difference of these two dimensions is the _analytical index_ of the operator. 

More generally, for $(E_p, D_p)$ an [[elliptic complex]], its analytical index is the alternating sum

$$
  ind_{an}(E_p, D_p)
  = 
  \sum_p (-1)^+ dim (ker (\Delta_p))
  \,.
$$

## Properties

This index does not the depend of the [[Sobolev space]] used to get a [[bounded operator]] (by elliptic regularity the kernel is made up of smooth sections and the same for the cokernel as it is the kernel of the adjoint). By [[topological K-theory]]  one can associate to it also a [[topological index]]. The [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]] say that this two indexes coincide.
