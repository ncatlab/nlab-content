
## Idea

When interpreting the [[Frobenius morphisms]] that appear in the [[Artin L-functions]] geometrically as flows (as discussed at _[Borger's arithmetic geometry -- Motivation](Borger's+absolute+geometry#Motivation)_) then this induces an evident analog of _[[zeta function]] of a [[dynamical system]]_.
