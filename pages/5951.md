(This might be the first public occurence of the precise term "cohesive topos". In the 2007 article _[Axiomatic cohesion](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/19/3/19-03abs.html)_ it still said "category of cohesion" and in a series of articles preceding that one (see [cohesive topos - References](cohesive%20topos#References)), other terms are used. In fact, at the same place but 18 years earlier, at the _[[Como|Como conference on Category Theory]]_, Lawvere used the term "category of Being", instead, in his _[[Some Thoughts on the Future of Category Theory]]_.)
