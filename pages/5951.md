  [video recording](http://dscpi.uninsubria.it/staff/Walters/Como_Category_Seminar/Meeting_in_honour_of_Bill_Lawvere/Records_of_the_Meeting.html) of the first few minutes of the first lecture

on [[cohesive topos]]es. 

> (This might be the first public occurence of the precise term "cohesive topos". In the 2007 article _[Axiomatic cohesion](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/19/3/19-03abs.html)_ it still said "category of cohesion" and in a series of articles preceding that one, other terms are used. In fact, at the same place but 18 years earlier, at the [[Como|Como conference on Category Theory]], Lawvere used the term "category of Being", instead, in his [[Some Thoughts on the Future of Category Theory]].)
