The **upper central series** of a group, $G$, is an ascending chain of subgroups 

$$
Z^0(G) \leq Z^1(G) \leq Z^2(G) \leq \ldots,
$$

where the zeroth member is the trivial group, the first member is the [[center]], the second member is the second center, and so on. 

$$
Z^0(G) = 1, Z^1(G) = Z(G), Z^2(G)/Z^1(G) = Z(G/Z^1(G)), Z^3(G)/Z^2(G) = Z(G/Z^2(G)), \ldots
$$

The indexing may be continued to the [[ordinals]], where the member indexed by a limiting ordinal is the union of all previous members.

For a [[nilpotent group]], the upper central series reaches the whole group in finitely many steps, and is the fastest ascending [[central series]]. It has the same length then as the [[lower central series]], although they need not coincide.
