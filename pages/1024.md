In a category $C$ with a singled out object $I$ such as a [[terminal object]] or a [[monoidal category|tensor unit]], for any object $c \in C$ the [[hom-set]]

$$
  Hom_C(I,c)
$$

is the set of **generalized elements** of $c$.


#Examples#

* For $C =$ [[Set]] and $I = \{\bullet\}$ the singleton set, the generalized elements of a set $C$ are precisely the ordinary elements of $C$.

* For $C = [D^{op}, Set]$  a [[presheaf]] category and for $I = \Delta_{pt} = (d \mapsto \{\bullet\})$ the presheaf constant on the singleton set, the generalized elements of a presheaf $F$ are the _global sections_ of this presheaf, equivalently these are the elements in the [[limit]] set over $F$.
