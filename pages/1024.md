## Idea and definition

In the category [[Set]] of [[set]]s, for $X$ a set, an element $x \in X$ is equivalently a [[morphism]] in [[Set]] (namely a function of sets) $x : {*} \to X$, where "$*$" denotes [[generalized the|the]] [[point]] -- the set with a single element.

However, from the point of view of the category [[Set]], most things that can be said and done about elements of a set $X$, can more generally be said and done for morphisms $x \colon U\to X$, for _any_ other set $U$.  The point is just that many constructions can be performed "elementwise".  For instance, the fact that elements of $X\times Y$ are exactly pairs $(x,y)$ of an element of $X$ and an element of $Y$, when performed "elementwise" for morphisms out of $U$, expresses the universal property of a [[product]].  In [[structural set theory]] such as [[ETCS]], one sometimes (but not necessarily) takes this point of view for axiomatizing the structure of $Set$.

On the other hand, once elements of objects are regarded as morphisms into these objects, the same reasoning applies to _every_ [[category]] $C$.  Accordingly, for $C$ any [[category]] and $X$ an [[object]] of $C$, one may refer to a [[morphism]] $x \colon U \to X$ a **generalized element** of $X$. One says this is a generalized element with **stage of definition** given by $U$.

The perspective of generalized elements of objects of a category $C$ is related to regarding $C$ as its image under the [[Yoneda embedding]]

$$
  Y : C \hookrightarrow [C^{op}, Set]
$$

into its [[presheaf category]]. Under this embedding, every object $X$ of $C$ is mapped to the [[functor]] -- the [[representable functor]] represented by it --

$$
  GenEl(X) : C^{op} \to Set
$$ 

that sends each object $U$ of $X$ to the set of generalized elements of $X$ at stage $U$.

It is also worth noting that the [[internal logic]] or [[type theory]] of a category provides us a way to go backwards formally.  By reasoning about "abstract elements" in a set-theoretic style like ordinary elements, the interpretation then "compiles" such proofs to category-theoretic ones which actually apply to all generalized elements.


## Examples 


### In $Set$

The primordial example is when $C$ is the category [[Set]] of sets and $I$ is a [[terminal object]] in $Set$ --- that is, a set with one element.  Then elements of any set $c$ are in one-to-one correspondence with functions $f: I \to c$.  This correspondence works as follows: given any element of $c$ there is a unique function $f: I \to c$ with this element in its image, and conversely each function $f: I \to c$ has a unique element of $c$ in its image. 

### In concrete categories

In the same way, in a [[concrete category]] whose underlying-set functor is represented by $I$, the $I$-elements of an object are the same as the elements of its underlying set.  (The category of sets is actually a special case of this, since it is concrete, with the identity functor represented by a terminal object.)

### Global elements

Generalizing from $Set$ in another way, in any category with a terminal object $I$, we call a morphism $f : I \to c$ a [[global element]] of the object $c$.

### In monoidal categories

On the other hand, it is common to take $I$ to be the unit object whenever $C$ is a [[monoidal category]].  The generalized elements defined over this $I$ are important in [[enriched category|enriched category theory]]).

### For generators

Arguably, the most general case where generalized elements defined at only one stage $I$ are "sufficient" when $I$ is some sort of [[generator]] of the category.  However, not every category has a single object as any sort of generator!  Instead, in arbitrary categories, generalized elements of *all* possible stages of definition must often be used to replace global elements.  Thus while a set is determined by its global elements, an object of an arbitrary category is determined by all of its generalized elements (this is one way to state the [[Yoneda lemma]]).

### In presheaf categories

For $C = [D^{op}, Set]$  a [[presheaf]] category and for $I = \Delta_{pt} = (d \mapsto \{\bullet\})$ the presheaf constant at the singleton set, the generalized elements of a presheaf $F$ are the _[[global section]]s_ of this presheaf, equivalently these are the elements in the [[limit]] set over $F$.

On the other hand, if $I=D(-,d)$ is a [[representable functor|representable]] presheaf, then the generalized elements of $F$ at stage $d$ are precisely the elements of the set $F(d)$, by the [[Yoneda lemma]].

### In abelian categories

An [[element in an abelian category]] is an equivalence class of generalised elements.

## Relationship to type theory

In the [[internal language|internal]] [[type theory]] of a category $C$, the generalized elements of $X$ at stage $U$ can be identified with [[terms]] of type $X$ in [[context]] $u\colon U$:
$$ 
   u\colon U \vdash x(u) \colon X
  \,. 
$$
See the references [below](#ReferencesInTypeTheory).

The fact that all type-theoretic constructions can be performed in any context implies that we can manipulate ordinary elements, and end up speaking also about generalized elements defined at arbitrary stages.
