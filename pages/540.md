## Idea

In [[higher category theory]] the term  _weak $\omega$-categories_ is essentially synonymous with _[[infinity-category]]_ in the fully general sense of _[[(infinity,infinity)-category]]_.  The terms "$\omega$-category" and "$\infty$-category" originate in different schools and their choice of use is mostly a matter of the preference of individual authors.  

One slight difference is that "$\infty$-category" usually implies a "weak" (fully general) notion, while in addition to weak $\omega$-categories there are also [[strict omega-category|strict ones]]. Another difference is that definitions of weak $\omega$-categories tend to be [[algebraic definitions of higher categories|algebraic]] instead of [[geometric definition of higher categories|geometric]] (accordingly typically the central open question is whether a definition really satisfies the [[homotopy hypothesis]]), though some definitions of weak $\omega$-categories are geometry (for instance some flavors of definition of [[opetopic omega-category]]).

## Examples

The following are examples for proposals of definitions of weak $\omega$-categories. 

* [[Trimble n-category|Trimble ∞-category]]

* [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak ω-category]]

* [[Batanin ω-category]]

* [[opetopic omega-category]]
