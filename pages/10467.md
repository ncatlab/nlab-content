## Idea 

What is called _global equivariant stable homotopy theory_ is a variant of [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] where  [[spectra]] are equipped with $G$-[[infinity-actions]] "for all [[compact Lie groups]] $G$ at once".

Often this is referred to just as "global stable homotopy theory" or even just "global homotopy theory". But there is also _unstable_ _[[global equivariant homotopy theory]]_.


More precisely, given an [[orthogonal spectrum]] $X$, then every [[representation]] $\rho \colon G \to O(n)$ of a [[compact Lie group]] on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ by [[orthogonal group]] [[actions]] induces a $G$-[[equivariant spectrum]] and hence a notion of $G$-equivariant [[homotopy groups]]. 

One says that a morphism of [[orthogonal spectra]] is a **global equivariant equivalence** if it induces [[isomorphisms]] on all $G$-equivariant [[homotopy groups]], for all $G$, this way. (This definition appears for instance as ([Schwede 13, def. 2.9](#Schwede13)), there referred to just as "global equivalence", which is maybe arguably a bit unsuggestive and possibly misleading.)

The **global equivariant stable homotopy category** $\mathcal{GH}$ is the ([[simplicial localization|simplicial]]) [[localization]] of the [[category]] of [[orthogonal spectra]] at these global equivariant equivalences (this is a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]]/[[triangulated category]].)

Since a global equivariant equivalence is in particular an ordinary [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of [[spectra]], there is a canonical functor

$$
  U \;\colon\; \mathcal{GH} \longrightarrow \mathcal{SH}
$$

from the global equivariant to the ordinary [[stable homotopy category]].

This functor has a ([[derived functor|derived]]) [[left adjoint]] and [[right adjoint]], which are both [[full and faithful functors]], hence which exhibit [[discrete object]]/[[codiscrete object]] structure

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{GH}
    &\stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{U}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{R}{\leftarrow}}}&
    \mathcal{SH}
  }
$$

on stable/triangulated categories ([Schwede 13, theorem IV 5.2](#Schwede13))

Global Borel-type [[equivariant cohomology]] is in the image of the [[right adjoint]] $R$ ([Schwede 13, example IV 5.12](#Schwede13))
