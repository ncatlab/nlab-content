
The term _parity_ means different things in different contexts:

## In superalgebra

In discussion of [[homological algebra|homological]] [[superalgebra]], _parity_ refers to the total $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded object|grading]] which in [Bernstein's convention](signs+in+supergeometry#SuperOddConvention) controls the [[signs in supergeometry|sign rule]]. See at _[[chain complex of super vector spaces]]_ the remark [on parity](chain+complex+in+super+vector+spaces#Parity).

## In particle physics
