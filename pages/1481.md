  An entry on the formalization of the process of [[quantization]] -- by [[category theory|abstract nonsense]] -- from classical [[sigma-model]] data to the corresponding [[quantum field theory]] .

=--



# Background and motivation #

The search is on for the abstract formalization of the process of _quantization_ -- the process that reads in a "classical field theory" for instance presented in form of a [[gauge theory]] or in form of a [[σ-model]] background field data -- and spits out the corresponding [[quantum field theory]].

+-- {.standout}

There is an open problem of mathematical (-[[physics]]) model building: what is the true formalism behind [[quantization]]?  That is to quantization such as, say, [[symplectic geometry]] is to [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]?

The formalism of [[FQFT]] clearly suggests that the fundamental description of [[quantization]] is some natural operation on higher functors.

=--



While for various aspects and facets of this question there are well-developed formalisms -- such as [[geometric quantization]] or [[deformation quantization]] or [[BV theory]] -- a full answer is certainly still missing, not the least because the full formalization of the _question_ itself has still to be established.

Considerable progress on this formulation of the question has been achieved with the formalization and proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] in _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_ by [[Jacob Lurie]]. This at least indicates what the _result_ of any full quantization procedure should be in that it clarifies what exactly a [[TQFT]] [[FQFT]] is: a morphism from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] $Z : Bord_n \to C$.

In [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]] Jacob Lurie only indicates the desire to find a similar formalization of "classical field theory" and a systematic procedure for turning the classical theory into the quantum theory.

These thoughts were further developed in [TFT from compact Lie groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0731), but remain sketchy for the moment. 

For the purpose of the present entry this indication of a quantizaton proposal by Lurie et al. mainly serves as a reference for the idea itself that a formalization of something interesting is to be sought here, and of the kind of [[category theory|abstract nonsense]] answer one hopes to find. We will however discuss a somewhat different-looking approach. It may well be related to the Lurie-et al proposal in the end, but for the time being we shall not concentrate on that relation.

Rather, the approach for a formalization of the quantization  procedure that shall be discussed at this entry here is more in the spirit as indicated to some extent in the work of [[David Ben-Zvi]] et. al, which is described in some detail at [[geometric ∞-function theory]]. This is essentially based on the idea that a [[quantum field theory]] is obtained from a [[σ-model]] target space object $X$ by homming [[extended cobordism]] [[cospan]]s $\Sigma_in \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$ into the target object and then pull-pushing [[geometric function object]]s through the resulting [[span]]s of configuration space objects $[\Sigma_{in},X] \leftarrow [\Sigma,X] \to [\Sigma_{out},X]$. 

The resulting pull-push operation is an example or a generalization of what [[John Baez]] discusses under the term [[groupoidification]]. David Ben-Zvi et al would speak of [[geometric function theory]].

The main result of David Ben-Zvi et. al.'s work on this approach is that they point out that as soon as the [[geometric function object]] one uses satisfies the two [[geometric ∞-function theory|fundamental theorems of geometric infinity-function theory]], a considerable amount of rich structure that has in parts been known by itself gets unified into one coherent elegant story: the nature of partition functions (i.e. traces), of centers, of Hochschild (co)homology, Deligne-Kontsevich-statements, etc. all are understood by means of a suitable [[geometric function theory]] as induced from the underlying geometry of configuration space objects $[\Sigma,X]$ as well as the [[loop space object]]s of $X$.

Here in this entry the aim is to discuss in detail aspects and models for the quantization procedure that is suggested by applying [[geometric function theory]] to [[σ-model]] backgrounds.

But more precisely, the premise of the discussion here is that a fundamental understanding of the situation is obtained after regarding seriously the fact that

1. background fields are not just encoded by the [[cohomology]] with coefficients in the target space object $X$, but by the corresponding [[differential cohomology]];

1. and that the functorial notion of the [[FQFT]] that one wants to obtain suggests that these differential cocycles themselves are encoded functorially, as described at [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|differential nonabelian cohomology]].

This means that we shall take the classical structure $\nabla$ which the sought-after quantization procedure is supposed to send to an [[FQFT]] $Z_\nabla : Bord_n \to C$ to be, essentially, a functor

$$
  \nabla : \Pi_n(X) \to A
$$

from some [[path n-groupoid]] of $X$ to some coefficient object $A$. 

Here the [[k-morphism]]s in $\Pi_n(X)$ are generated from the existing $k$-morphisms in $X$ as well as the $k$-dimensional smooth paths in $X$. The functor $\nabla$ on this encodes the _parallel transport_ of a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on a [[principal ∞-bundle]] over $X$: this assignment of [[k-morphism]]s in $A$ to $k$-dimensional paths in $X$ is the assignment of the **classical action** to trajectories in $X$.

More precisely, this is the classical action assigned to topologically disk-shaped $k$-paths. The full classical action of a classical [[σ-model]] quantum field theory is an extension of $\nabla$ 

$$
  \array{ 
    \Pi(X) \stackrel{\nabla}{\to}  A &\to& V
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\exp(S_\nabla)}
    \\
    Bord(X)
  }
$$

from disk-shaped cobordisms to _all_ [[cobordism]]s in $X$ (possibly and usually after an extension of the codomain to some new codomain $V$). This extension $\exp(i S_\nabla)$ knows not just the parallel transport, but also the **holonomy** of the classical background field.

The question to be analyzed here is how this classical action $\exp(i S_\nabla) : Bord_n(X) \to F$ transmutes systematically to an [[FQFT]] $Z_\nabla : Bord_n \to C$ on abstract bordisms (possibly with extra structure, if we pass from [[TQFT]] to richer theories like [[CFT]]). This step should be the **[[path integral]]**: 

in some way the assignment of $Z_\nabla$ to a [[cobordism]] $\Sigma$ is expected to be obtained by "summing" in some way the value of $\exp(i S_\nabla)$ on elements in the fiber of the [[forgetful functor]] $Bord_n(X) \to Bord_n$ over $\Sigma$, i.e. over all possible ways to map $\Sigma$ into $X$ -- the sum of $\exp(S_\nabla(\phi))$ over all _paths_ or _field configurations_  $\phi : \Sigma \to X$.

The basic idea that we shall follow has been sketched to some extent in the notes

* [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their sigma model QFTs]]. 

These notes in turn have grown out of the blog entry [An Exercise in Groupoidification -- the path integral](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/06/an_exercise_in_groupoidificati.html) from which the present entry draws its name. We hope to refine the discussion a bit more now, provide more details and more systematics.


# General procedure #


This section describes the general formalism that we want to study as a candidate for (aspects of) a fundamental [[category theory|abstract-nonsense]] description of [[quantization]]. The next section then picks special (simple) cases and works out the action of the abstract machinery on these.

+-- {.standout}

In rough outline the procedure is this:

* In a context $\mathbf{H}$ of sufficiently general spaces;

* we extend the _background field_ parallel transport $\nabla : \Pi(X) \to A$ to an action functional $\exp(S_\nabla) : Bord(X) \to V$.

* Then for each [[cobordism]] $\Sigma$ the component of the action functional $\exp(S_\nabla)|_\Sigma : [\Sigma,X] \to V$ on $\Sigma$ defines a total $V$-[[principal infinity-bundle|bundle]] space $E_\Sigma$;

* the _points_ of $E_\Sigma$ are the Dirac-$\delta$-distributional _sections_ or _quantum states_   

  -- these are picked and added up by the objects in the [[over category]] [[examples for geometric function objects|geometric function object]] $C(E_x) := \mathbf{H}/{E_x}$.

* the quantum propagation along a [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] $\Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$ is the pull-push of [[geometric function theory]]/[[groupoidification]] 

  $$
    Z_\nabla(\Sigma) : C(E_{\Sigma_{in}})
      \stackrel{out_* in^*}{\to}
      C(E_{\Sigma_{out}})
  $$

  through the corresponding [[span]] $E_{\Sigma_{in}} \leftarrow E_{\Sigma} \to E_{\Sigma_{out}}$ of total spaces.

=--



## the notion of space ##



We need to talk about _spaces_ of sorts: 

* a space $X$ that is the **target space** -- often, but not always, to be interpreted as physical spacetime -- in which the $d$-dimensional object -- for $d=0$ for instance a point particle such as an _electron_ -- whose dynamics we want to encode propagates.

  This space may be just a [[manifold]] but we want to allow it to be a kind of space a bit more general than that, for instance an [[orbifold]].

  When we are describing [[gauge theory]] the target space is smooth refinement of a [[classifying space]] $\mathbf{B}G$.

  When we are describing finite gauge theory such as [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]], the target space is just the one-object [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G$ that is the [[delooping]] of the gauge group $G$. 

* for each $(d+1)$-dimensional [[manifold]] $\Sigma$ a **path space** or **configuration space** $[\Sigma,X]$ of maps from $\Sigma$ into $X$.

The [[category theory|general abstract nonsence]] for dealing with general spaces of this sort is that of [[space and quantity]]. As described at [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]], this leads one to describe a space as an [[infinity-stack]] on some [[site]] $S$.

In the simplest case, which the reader should keep in mind, the [[site]] in question is the [[point]] and an [[infinity-stack]] on it is just an [[infinity-groupoid]]. In turn in simple cases of this, which the reader should still keep in mind, this [[infinity-groupoid]] will be just a [[groupoid]] or at most a [[2-groupoid]].

Whichever choice one makes, the collection of all such generalized spaces modeled on a certain [[site]] $S$ forms an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$. 

Despite possibly its appearance, the reader should take this statement as suggesting an immense simplification instead of a huge complification: the language of [[(infinity,1)-topos]] is a user interface that makes pretty sophisticated and rich notions of generalized spaces have the same look-and-feel as just plain [[topological space]]s. It's the inner workings of the formalism that will take of things coming out right even when we talk about richer objects.

In particular, it is the machinery of [[models for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes]] that provides all the tools for actually performing the operations that we shall consider. The reader unfamiliar with that will suffer little loss from concentrating his or attention on the toy examples where all "spaces" involved are finite [[groupoid]]s and trust that everything goes through analogously also in the other examples.


## the notion of path ##


With an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] context $\mathbf{H}$-fixed we are in a context that allows us to study [[cohomology]]. A classical background field on a target space $X$ is in parts a cocycle on $X$ with values in some coefficient object $A \in \mathbf{H}$.

But, as indicated above, it is actually, more: it is a _differential cocycle_ on $X$: something that depends not just on $X$ itself, but also on a notion of paths in $X$.

To encode this we may pick a [[simplicial object|cosimplicial object]]

$$
  \Delta_H : \Delta \to \mathbf{H}
$$

in our $(\infty,1)$-category of spaces, that encodes which object in $\mathbf{H}$ models the standard $k$-[[simplex]] regarded as a space. For instance if $\mathbf{H}$ is the [[(infinity,1)-topos]] of [[Lie ∞-groupoid]]s modeled by [[∞-stack]]s on [[Diff]], we would take $\Delta_H^n$ to be the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta^n_H \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ regarded as a smooth [[manifold]] in the standard way.

Then the space of disk-shaped $k$-dimensional paths in $X$ is $[\Delta_H^n,X]$.

These spaces glue together to the [[path infinity-groupoid]]

$$
  \Pi(X) := \lim_\to [\Delta_H^\bullet, X]
  \,.
$$

This is an [[∞-groupoid]] whose [[k-morphism]] are generated from the original $k$-morphisms of $X$ and the $k$-dimensional path $\phi : \Delta^k_H \to X$.

For instance if $X = Y//G$ is a global [[orbifold]], the 1-morphisms in $\Pi(X)$ will be generated from smooth paths $\gamma: y_1 \to y_2$ in $Y$ as well as orbifold jumps $g : y_1 \to g(y_1)$ subject to the relation

$$
  \array{
    y_1 &\stackrel{g}{\to}& g(y_1)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\gamma} && \downarrow^{g(\gamma)}
    \\
    y_2 &\stackrel{g}{\to}& g(y_2)
  }
  \,.
$$

Or if $X = C(Y)$ is realized as the [[Cech nerve]] of some [[Cech cover]] $(U = \coprod_i U_i) \to Y$ then $\Pi(X)$ will be generated from paths $(\gamma,i) : (y_1,i) \to (y_2,i)$ in $U_i$ for all $i$ and transitions $(y,i) \to (y,j)$ for all $y \in U_i \cap U_j$ subject to the condition

$$
  \array{
    (y_1,i) &\stackrel{}{\to}& (y_1,j)
    \\
    \downarrow^{(\gamma,i)} && \downarrow^{(\gamma,j)}
    \\
    (y_2,i) &\stackrel{}{\to}& (y_2,j)
  }
  \,.
$$


## the notion of trajectory ##


More generally, let $D$ be some [[poset]] and specify a functor

$$
  \Sigma_H : D \to \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

We think of as the image of some $k \in D$ under $\Sigma_H$  as the realization in $\mathbf{H}$ of some abstract [[cobordism]] whose boundary component inclusions are the images $\Sigma^j_H \to \Sigma_H^k$ of all morphisms $j \to k$ in $D$.

So $\Sigma_H$ encodes a [[multispan|multi-cospan]] of cobordisms in $H$. In principle $\Sigma_H$ will in general be supposed to range over _all_ cobordisms in some sense, but for our discussion it will be complete sufficient to concentrate on much less. Most of our discussion concerns a handful of cobordisms, usually just two of them and their composites.

In any case, by slight abuse of notation, we shall write

$$
  Bord(X) := \lim_\to [\Sigma_H^\bullet, X]
$$

and speak of the $\infty$-groupoid of **bordisms in $X$**. If we assume that $\Sigma_H$ ranges at least over the disk-shaped cobordisms $\Delta^k_H$ we have a canonical inclusion

$$
  \Pi(X) \hookrightarrow Bord(X)
  \,.
$$


## the notion of background field and action functional ##

a flat classical background field (with vanishing [[field strength]]) is a morphism


$$
  \nabla : \Pi(X) \to A
$$

(the more general situation is described at ..., but need not concern us here for the moment. It's quantization will structurally be a bit, but not essentially different from that of the flat case)

this encodes an $A$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]]. 

In the case that $A = \mathbf{B}G$ is the [[delooping]] of an $\infty$-group $G$, so that $A$ has a unique [[pointed object|point]] $pt_A : {*} \to \mathbf{B}G$ the total space of this [[principal ∞-bundle]] is the ([[homotopy pullback|homotopy]]) [[pullback]] $P$ in

$$ 
 \array{
  P &\to& {*}
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  X \simeq [pt,X] &\stackrel{\nabla|_{pt}}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
 }
  \,,
$$

where $\nabla|_{pt}$ is the component of $\nabla$ (as a morphism out of a colimit) on points in $X$.

We are interested in forming the associated $\infty$-bundle induced by a choice of [[representation]]

$$
  \rho : A \to V
$$

on some [[(∞,1)-category]] $V$. As a cocycle this is just the composite

$$
  \rho_* \nabla : \Pi(X) \stackrel{\nabla}{\to}
   A \stackrel{\rho}{\to} V
  \,.
$$

This is the _background field_ that encodes the forces acting on the objects propagating in $X$ whose quantum dynamics we seek.

We will often abuse notation and write just $\nabla$ for $\rho_* \nabla$, when the context is clear.

A choice of extension of this through the inclusion $\Pi(X) \to Bord(X)$ is the corresponding **action functional** $\exp(S_\nabla)$

$$
  \array{
    \Pi(X) &\stackrel{\nabla}{\to}& V
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\exp(S_\nabla)}
    \\
    Bord(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

For each cobordism $\Sigma$ the component $\exp(S_\nabla)|_\Sigma$ of the action functional will define a total space of an associated bundle $E_\Sigma$. These are discussed in the next section.


## the notion of section and state ##

A _state_ of the quantum theory over a cobordism $\Sigma$ is supposed to be a _section_ of the bundle $E_\Sigma \to [\Sigma,X]$ over the configuration space $[\Sigma,X]$ of fields on $\Sigma$, where we allow generalized sections that may be distributional.

In order to define sections and states,
we need to fix a [[point]] of the coefficient object $V$, i.e. a morphism

$$
  pt_V : {*} \to V
$$

from the [[terminal object]] ${*}$ into $V$. The choice of this point determines over which [[monoid]] our quantum theory will be linear:

**definition (ground monoid)**

given the [[pointed object]] ${*} \stackrel{pt_V}{\to} V$ we say that the respective **ground monoid** is the [[endomorphism|endomorphism monoid]]

$$
  \Omega_{pt} V = End_V(pt_V)
$$

i.e. the [[2-limit|lax pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \Omega_{pt} V &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{pt_V}
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{pt_V}{\to}& V
  }
  \,.
$$

**example: ordinary linear quantum mechanism**

In the special case that $V = $ [[Vect]] over some ground field $k$ the canonical point is that ground field and then the "ground monoid" is again canonically identified with the ground field: $End_{Vect_k}(k) \simeq k$. Therefore the name "ground monoid" as a generalization of this situation.


More generally, for $W : {*}\to V$ any other point of $V$, we say that the [[2-limit|lax pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    el_{pt_V}(W) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{pt_V}
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{W}{\to}& V
  }
$$

is the object of _elements of $W$_ relative to the chosen point.

**example: ordinary vectors**

Again in the special case that $V = $ [[Vect]] with the above standard point, $W \in V$ will be some vector space and $el_{k}(W)$ is the set, regarded as a [[discrete category]] of its ordinaly elements -- the vectors in $W$.

Moreover, given the background field differential cocycle or the action functional

$$
  \exp(S_\nabla)  : Bord(X)  \to V
$$

we have the [[2-limit|lax pullback]]

$$
  \array{  
    E &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{pt_V}
    \\
    Bord(X) &\stackrel{\exp(S_\nabla)}{\to}&
   V
  }
$$

Next we make use of the fact that we are in fact in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] so that [[colimit]]s are [[pullback stability|pullback stable]]... (not yet, really)

For each component $\exp(S_\nabla)|_\Sigma : [\Sigma,X] \to V$ we get a corresponding lax pullback

$$
  \array{  
    E_{\Sigma} &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{pt_V}
    \\
    [\Sigma,X] &\stackrel{\exp(S_\nabla)|_\Sigma}{\to}&
   V
  }
$$

in particular the fiber over $x \in X$ of $E_{pt}$

$$
  \array{
    el_{pt_v}(E_x)
    &\to&
    E_{pt} &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow &&\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\stackrel{x}{\to}& X
     &\stackrel{\exp(S_\nabla)|_{pt}}{\to}& V
  }
$$

is the fiber of the underlying $V$-$\infty$-bundle

**example**

in the case that $V = FinVect$ and $\nabla : \Pi(X) \to Vect$ is a [[vector bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] and with the canonical point chosen for $Vect$ as above, this $el_{pt_V}(E_x)$ is simply the fiber of that vector bundle over $x$.

Choose the [[geometric function theory]] given by [[over category|over categories]] in $\mathbf{H}$ as described at [[examples for geometric function objects]]

$$
  C :=  \mathbf{H}/(-) :   \mathbf{H} \to (\infty,1)Cat
$$

a _section of the background field_ or _state of the quantum system_ is over each point $x$ an object $C(E_x)$.


### special case: degroupoidification for $V$-phased groupoids ##

In the case that $V = FinVect$ we have that $E_x$ is (the [[discrete category]] on the set underlying) a vector space.

For $(\psi : \Psi \to E_x) \in C(E_x)$ consider the underlying morphism of plain $\infty$-groupoids and interpret this as the vector

$$
  \sum_{v \in E_x} |\psi^{-1}(v)|\cdot v
$$  

given by the linear combination of all elements $v \in E_x$ weighted by the [[groupoid cardinality]] of the [[infinity-groupoid]] sitting over it.


##  the propagation map ##

In total the above discussion yields, starting from a background field $\nabla : \Pi(X) \to V$, a [[multispan]] of  $\infty$-bundles $E_\Sigma$ over configuration spaces $[\Sigma,X]$.

An an object in the [[over category]] $C(E_{\Sigma}) := \mathbf{H}/E_{\Sigma}$ encodes a -- possibly distributional -- section of $E_\Sigma \to [\Sigma,X]$. The quantum propagation we take to be the pull-push of the [[geometric function object]]s $C(E_\Sigma)$ through this [[multispan]].


...

Let $\Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$
be a [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] regarded as part of the [[multispan|multi-cospan]] $\Sigma_H$ that defines $Bord(X)$ as

$$
  Bord(X) = \lim_\to [\Sigma^\bullet_H,X]
$$

this realizes $Bord(X)$ as the universal cocone whose component under $\Sigma$ is

$$
  \array{
    && [\Sigma,X]
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    [\Sigma_{in},X]
    &&&&
    [\Sigma_{out},X]
    \\
    &
    {}_{\exp(S_\nabla)}_{in}\searrow
    & \downarrow^{\exp(S_\nabla)_\Sigma}
    &
    \swarrow_{\exp(S_\nabla)_{out}}
    \\
    &&
    V
  }
$$

by lax pullback of $pt_V : {*} \to V$ this induces a span of total spaces

$$
  \array{
    && E_{in \mapsto out}
    \\
    & {}^{in}\swarrow && \searrow^{out}
    \\
    E_{in}
    &&
    &&
    E_{out}
  }
$$

**definition** the "quantum propagation along $\Sigma$" is the functor of [[geometric function object]]s

$$
  Z_\nabla(\Sigma)
  : 
  C(E_{in})
  \stackrel{out_* {in}^*}{\to}
  C(E_{out})
$$


given $\psi : \Psi \to E_{in}$ we extract the corresponding "degroupoidified" vector of the corresponding section over $\phi|_{\Sigma_in} \in [\Sigma_{in},X]$ as the pullback

$$
  \array{
    p^* \Psi
    &\to&
    \Psi
    \\
    \downarrow^{\psi|_{\phi|_{\Sigma_{in}}}}
    &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    V_{\phi|_{\Sigma_{in}}} &\stackrel{p}{\to}& E_{in}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*}
    &\stackrel{\phi|_{\Sigma_{in}}}{\to}&
    [\Sigma_{in},X]
  }
$$



# Concrete examples #

## electromagnetically charged particle ##

..

take $A = \mathbf{B}U(1)$ such that

$$
 \nabla : P_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}U(1)
$$

encodes the [[electromagnetic field]]

and choose the standard representation

$$
  \rho : \mathbf{B}U(1) \to Vect
$$

then the above propagation prescription sends the $\delta$-section $\delta_x$ \to $U \delta_x : y \mapsto$ = sum over all paths $\gamma : x \to y$ of $\exp(S_\nabla(\gamma))$.


## [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] ##

Let $X = \mathbf{B}G$ for $G$ a finite [[group]]. Then $[\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G] = G Bund(\Sigma)$ is the [[orbifold]] of $G$-[[principal bundle]]s on $\Sigma$.

Consider for simplicity just codimension 1. To do that regard $Bord(\mathbf{B}G)$ as a 1-category whose objects are 2-dimensional closed manifolds $\Sigma_{in}, \Sigma_{out}$ and whose morphism corresponding spans of 3-dimensional cobordisms $\Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$.  

Then 

$$
  Z(\Sigma) : C(E_{\Sigma_{in}})  \to 
    C(E_{\Sigma_{out}})
$$

is under the above "degroupoidification" the action of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, where the $\frac{1}{|Aut(P)|}$-weight comes from the fact that the pulled back state ${in}^* \psi$ picks up the automorphisms of $P$ by the push-forward

$$
  \array{
    && in^* \Psi
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow^{in^* \psi}
    \\
    \Psi && && E_{\Sigma}
    \\
    &\searrow^{\psi}& & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    && E_{\Sigma_{in}}
    &&&&
    E_{\Sigma_{out}}
  }
$$
