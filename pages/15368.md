## Idea

One of the conditions in the definition of _[[metric]]_ and _[[norm]]_ say that the norm of the sum of any two elements $f$ and $g$ is smaller than or equal to the sum of their norms:

$$
  {\vert f + g \vert} \leq {\vert f\vert} + {\vert g\vert }
  \,.
$$

For the usual metric/norm on [[Euclidean space]] and $f$ and $g$ two edges of a triangle

$$
  \array{
    && y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    x && \underset{f + g}{\longrightarrow} && z
  }
$$

then this [[inequality]] expresses that the straight path from $x$ to $z$ is always shorter or at worst as long as the path from $x$ to $z$ via $y$.

However, [[normed fields]] and hence [[normed vector spaces]] for which this example gives the correct intuition are rare among all normed fields and vector spaces, they are called the _[[archimedean]]_ such cases. Most norms instead satisfy the stronger [[ultrametric]] triangle inequality which says that

$$
  {\vert f + g \vert} \leq may({\vert f\vert}, {\vert g\vert })
  \,.
$$

These are called [[non-archimedean]].
