## Definition

An unbounded [[chain complex]] $X_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet$

$$
  \cdots \to X_2 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_1 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_0 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_{-1} \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_{-2} \stackrel{\partial}{\to} \cdots   
$$


is called _[[connective]]_ if it has no nontrivial [[homology groups]] in negative degree. Often one means more strictly that it is connective if it is concentrated in non-negative degree, hence if $X_{-n} \simeq 0$ for all $n \geq 1$, hence if it is of the form

$$
  \cdots \to X_2 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_1 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_0 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} 0 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} 0 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} \cdots   
  \,.
$$

This is _connective_ as in _[[connective spectrum]]_. Hence a connective chain complex is in particular a [[bounded chain complex]], bounded from below.

## Examples

* The [[singular chain complex]] of a [[topological space]] is connective. This is directly related to the fact that the [[homotopy groups]] of topological spaces are in non-negative degree, as opposed to their [[stabilization]] by [[spectra]], which may have homotopy groups also in negative degrees.

## Properties

### Relation to simplicial groups

The [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] asserts that connective chain complexes of [[abelian groups]] are equivalent to [[abelian group|abelian]] [[simplicial groups]].
