## Idea

Physical oscillations (of [[elasticity|elastic]] bodies) are described via a [[wave equation]] and hence by the [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of a [[Laplace operator]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]]. The phrase _hearing the shape of a drum_ in this context refers to the issue of recovering a Riemannian manifold from just the spectrum of the Laplace operator on it ("[[spectral geometry]]").

In plain Riemannian geometry there are counter-examples to the possibility of recovering Riemannian manifolds from just the spectrum of their Laplace operator. But from a little bit more of information, enhancing the Laplace operator to a _[[spectral triple]]_ it becomes possible in general. This theorem due to [[Alain Connes]] is the motivation for the formulation of all of metric geometry via [[spectral triples]], a program which is known as Connes' _[[noncommutative geometry]]_.
