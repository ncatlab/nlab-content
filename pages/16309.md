## Idea

Physical oscillations (of elastic bodies) are described via a [[wave equation]] and hence by the [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of a [[Laplace operator]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]]. The phrase _hearing the shape of a drum_ in this context refers to the issue of recovering a Riemannian manifold from just the spectrum of the Laplace operator on it ("[[spectral geometry]]").

In fact there are counter-examples, and it is not in general possible to identify a Riemannian manifold from just the spectrum of a Laplace operator. But from a little bit more of information, enhancing the Laplace operator to a _[[spectral triple]]_ it is possible. This theorem due to [[Alain Connes]] is the motivation for the formulation of all of metric geometry via [[spectral triples]], a program which is known as Connes' _[[noncommutative geometry]]_.
