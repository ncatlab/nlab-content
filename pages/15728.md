## Idea

A **class-locally presentable category** is a generalisation of a [[locally presentable category]], in that one may need a [[proper class]] of objects to build all the others by suitable colimits.

## Definition

Let $\lambda$ be a [[regular cardinal]], and let the category $C$ be [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]]. Then $C$ is called **class $\lambda$-presentable** if there is a class $A \subset C$ of $\lambda$-presentable objects such that every object of $C$ is a $\lambda$-filtered colimit of objects in $A$. A category of class-locally presentable if it is class $\lambda$-presentable for some $\lambda$.

If $C$ merely has $\lambda$-filtered colimits, rather than all colimits (and limits), then it is called **class $\lambda$-accessible**, and **class-accessible** if it is class $\lambda$-accessible for some $\lambda$.
