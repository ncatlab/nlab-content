## Idea

In [[physics]], _moduli stabilization_ refers to the problem of rendering [[Kaluza-Klein compactifications]] stable.

A [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] is a [[model (physics)|model]] of [[gravity]] where [[spacetime]] is assumed to be a higher dimensional [[fiber bundle]], with [[compact topological space|compact]] [[fibers]] of tiny extension, such that the resulting physics looks effectively lower-dimensional, but inheriting extra [[field (physics)|fields]]. Namely the size and shape of the compactified extra dimension is encoded in the [[Riemannian metric]], hence in the field of gravity, hence are themselves dynamical fields. Since these fields parameterize the [[moduli space]] of the KK-compactification, they are called _[[moduli fields]]_. 

The problem of _moduli stabilization_ is the problem of identifying mechanisms or conditions that ensure that as these fields dynamically evolve, the compact spatial dimensions remain stably so, neither opening up nor collapsing. For [[phenomenology|phenomenoloigcally]] realistic KK-compactifications the compact volume has to stably be a tiny but finite value ("volume stabilization").


Equivalently, since fast varying moduli appear as light or massless [[particles]] in the low-dimensional [[effective field theory]] which would show up in accelerator [[experiments]] (such as the [[LHC]]) but don't, the problem is to identify mechanisms or conditions that would render these moduli fields massive.

In [[classical field theory]] of [[gravity]] then KK-compactifications are argued ([Penrose 03, section 10.3](#Penrose03)) to generically be unstable by the [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorem]]. 

In [[string theory]] it is argued that string theoretic effects may stabilize the compact dimensions, namely a combination of [[flux compactification]] and [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[brane]] effects ([Acharya 02](#Acharya02), [KKLT 03](#KKLT03)). However, these arguments typically focus on fluctuations that preserve given [[special holonomy]] ([[supersymmetry and Calabi-Yau manifolds|Calabi-Yau 3-folds]] in type II or [[M-theory on G2-manifolds|G2-manifolds in M-theory]]). There is also a more generic argument for volume compactification by string winding modes ("Brandenberger-Vafa mechanism" [Brandenberger-Vafa 89](#BrandenbergerVafa89), [Watson-Brandenberger 03](#WatsonBrandenberger03)) and the claim ([Kim-Nishimura-Tsuchiya 12](#KimNishimuraTsuchiya12)) that in the non-perturbative [[IKKT model]] computer simulations show a spontaneous stable compactification to 3+1 dimensions.

## In string theory

The issue of stabilization of compact dimensions arises notably in [[string theory]] [[Kaluza-Klein compactifications]]. 

In the context of [[type II string theory]] one way to design the [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] such that the moduli fields are massive is to consider the case where [[higher gauge field|higher]] [[background gauge fields]] [[vacuum expectation value|vacuum expectation values]] (VEVs) $F_p$ are present on the compactification space.  Since these fields are characterized by their higher [[field strength]]/[[curvature]] forms which are referred to as "[[flux]]" terms in physics, these models are called **[[flux compactification]]** models ([KKLT 03](#KKLT03)).

Because the standard [[kinetic action]] term

$$
  S_{kin} \propto \int F_p \wedge \star_g F_p
$$

couples the flux VEV to the metric $g$ (via the [[Hodge star operator]]) and hence to the moduli, it generically induces an effective [[potential energy]] for these, which may stabilize them (when including [[non-perturbative effects]]).

Similarly in [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] the 4-form flux of the [[supergravity C-field]] leads to potentials for the moduli, which is argued to generically stabilize them ([Acharya 02](#Acharya02)).

Since for these flux compactifications only the [[periods]] of the form fields on the compact space matter, under a bunch of further assumptions on the nature of the compactification, one can reduce the number of possible such compactifications to a combinatorial problem. The resulting space of possibilities is also known  as the _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_.

The moduli stabilization in ([KKLT 03](#KKLT03)) was demonstrated in two steps. First, all moduli were stabilized at a fixed minimum with a negative [[cosmological constant]]. This was achieved by combining fluxes with [[non-perturbative effects]]. Second, the minimum was lifted to a metastable vacuum with a positive cosmological constant. This was accomplished by adding anti D-branes and using previous results, obtained in ([Kachru-Pearson-Verlinde 01](#KachruPearsonVerlinde01)), that the flux-anti D-brane system can form a metastable bound state with positive energy. In ([KKLT 03](#KKLT03)) it was also shown that one can fine tune various parameters to make the value of the [[cosmological constant]] consistent with the observed amount of [[dark energy]].
