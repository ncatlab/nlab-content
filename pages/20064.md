# The algebraic small object argument

## Idea

The ordinary [[small object argument]] is a way of constructing (often [[combinatorial wfs|combinatorial]]) [[weak factorization systems]] from a set of "generators".  While powerful and useful, it has several defects, such as:

* Its result is not uniquely determined.  In particular, it does not converge: we just go on until we've gone on long enough, but going on longer would produce a different result.

* Relatedly, it has no universal property.  This makes it hard to deal with category-theoretically.

* It does not suffice to construct every weak factorization system, not even every [[accessible wfs|accessible]] one.

The algebraic small object argument is a refinement of the small object argument, due to [Garner](#Garner), that remedies these defects.

## Properties

* The result of the algebraic small object argument is an [[algebraic weak factorization system]], which is "freely generated" by the input data in an appropriate sense.

* If the underlying category is [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]], then this awfs is in particular an [[accessible weak factorization system]].  Conversely, any accessible wfs can be generated by the algebraic small object argument; see [Rosicky](#Rosicky).

* Not every accessible *algebraic* wfs can be generated by the algebraic small object argument as above: every accessible wfs admits *some* algebraic realization that's generated by the algebraic SOA above, but it could admit other algebraic realizations that are not.  However, there is a further refinement of the algebraic SOA, due to [Bourke and Garner](#BourkeGarnerI), that takes as input a *double* category, and does suffice to generate all accessible algebraic wfs.
