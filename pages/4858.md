
Roger Penrose is a [[mathematical physics|mathematical physicist]] at University of Oxford. 

* [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose)


He made fundamental contributions to the study of mathematical [[general relativity]], such as the [[Penrose-Hawking theorem]] and the discovery of the [[twistor space]] description of [[spacetime]] geometry.

Later Penrose became interested in what are typically regarded as more [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions regarding the interplay of [[mathematics]], [[physics]] with the human [[mind]].

([Penrose 94, section 8.7](#Penrose94))


Penrose (controversially) argued that [[quantum gravity]] effects on [[decoherence]] of [[quantum superposition]] causes [[physics]] to be non-[[computability|computable]] and serves to explain aspects of the human [[mind]] such as [[consciousness]]. This latter aspect he is more recently developing in more concrete detail in [[quantum biology]] (see there for more) with [[Stuart Hameroff]].
