
Roger Penrose is a [[mathematical physics|mathematical physicist]] at University of Oxford. 

* [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose)


He made fundamental contributions to the study of mathematical [[general relativity]], such as the [[Penrose-Hawking theorem]] and the discovery of the [[twistor space]] description of [[spacetime]] geometry.

## Selected thoughts


### Mind-Maths-Matter
 {#MindMathsMatter}

Penrose has highlighted the subtle [[philosophy|philosophical]] issue of the  
apparent interrelation of [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and the [[mind]] ([Penrose 94, section 8.7](#Penrose94), [Penrose 05](#Penrose05)):

$$
  \array{
     && logic
     \\
     & \swarrow && \nwarrow
     \\
     physics  &&\longrightarrow &&  mind
  }
$$

Here the composite arrow from [[mind]] over [[logic]]/[[mathematics]] to nature/[[physics]] resonates with the [[absolute idealism]] of the _[[Science of Logic]]_.

### Quantum gravity effects in neurons

Penrose (controversially) argued that [[quantum gravity]] effects on [[decoherence]] of [[quantum superposition]] causes [[physics]] to be non-[[computability|computable]] and serves to explain aspects of the human [[mind]] such as [[consciousness]], by causing [[wave function collapse]] in microtubuli inside neurons. This latter aspect he is more recently developing in more concrete detail in [[quantum biology]] (see there for more) with [[Stuart Hameroff]].

### Moduli stabilization
 {#ModuliStabilization}

In [Penrose 03, section 10.3](#Penrose03) it is pointed out that the [[Penrose-Hawking theorem]] immediately implies that in _pure_ [[Einstein gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) small compact dimensions of [[spacetime]], as assumed in [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]], cannot be stable. 
From this the author draws the conclusion that [[moduli stabilization]] in [[KK-compactifications]] in general and in [[string phenomenology]] in particular can never work, a claim later repeated in [Penrose 16](#Penrose16). 

However, all claims of [[moduli stabilization]] in the literature concern not pure gravity, but [[gravity]] coupled to a [[gauge field]] ([[Einstein-Maxwell theory]]) or [[higher gauge field]] ([[supergravity]]) with non-trivial [[field strength]] on the compact dimensions, whence called _[[flux compactifications]]_. It is the repulsive [[force]] of the gauge field in the compact fibers which counteracts the gravitational collapse.

This is not specific to [[string theory]] and can be seen in elementary terms ([Freund-Rubin 80](moduli+stabilization#FreundRubin80)) and in simple toy examples such as in plain 6-dimensional [[Einstein-Maxwell theory]] ([Salam et. al., 83 ](moduli+stabilization#RDSS83)).
