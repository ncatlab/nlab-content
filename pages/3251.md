## Idea

Equivariant stable homotopy theory over some [[topological group]] $G$ is the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[G-spectra]]. This includes the [[naive G-spectra]] which constitute the actual [[stabilization]] of [[equivariant homotopy theory]], but is more general, one speaks of _genuine $G$-spectra_. Notably a genuine $G$-spectrum has [[homotopy groups]] graded by the group of [[integers]], but by the [[representation ring]] of $G$ (usually called [[RO(G)-grading]]).

The concept of [[cohomology]] in equivariant stable homotopy theory is _[[equivariant cohomology]]_:

[[!include equivariant cohomology -- table]]

## Basic definitions

### In terms of looping by representation spheres

The definition of _[[G-spectrum]]_ is typically given in generalization of the definition of [[coordinate-free spectrum]].

A **[[G-universe]]** in this context is (e.g. [Greenlees-May, p. 10](#GreenleesMay)) an infinite dimensional real [[inner product space]] equipped with a linear $G$-[[action]] that is the [[direct sum]] of [[countable|countably]] many copies of a given [[set]] of (finite dimensional? -DMR) [[representations]] of $G$, at least containing the trivial representation on $\mathbb{R}$ (so that $U$ contains at least a copy of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$).

Each such subspace of $U$ (representation contained in $U$? -DMR) is called an _indexing space_ ([[RO(G)-grading]]). For $V \subset W$ indexing spaces, write $W-V$ for the orthogonal complement of $V$ in $W$. Write $S^V$ for the [[one-point compactification]] of $V$; and for $X$ any (pointed) [[topological space]] write $\Omega^V := [S^V,X]$ for the corresponding (based) sphere space.

A **[[G-space]]** in the following means a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological space]] equipped with a continuous [[action]] of the [[topological group]] $G$ that fixes the base point. A  morphism of $G$-spaces is a continuous map that fixes the basepoints and is $G$-equivariant.

A weak equivalence of $G$-spaces is a morphism that induces isomorphism on all $H$-fixed homotopy groups (...)

A **$G$-spectrum** $E$ (indexed on the chosen universe $U$) is

* for each indexing space $V \subset U$ a $G$-space $E V$;

* for each pair $V \subset W$ of indexing spaces a $G$-equivariant [[homeomorphism]]

  $$
    E V \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Omega^{W-V} E W
    \,.
  $$

A [[morphism]] $f : E \to E'$ of $G$-spectra is for each indexing space $V$ a morphism of $G$-spaces $f_V : E V \to E' V$, such that this makes the obvious diagrams commute.

This becomes a [[category with weak equivalences]] by setting:

a morphism $f$ of $G$-spectra is a **weak equivalence of $G$-spectra** if for every indexing space $V$ the component $f_V$ is a weak equivalence of $G$-spaces (as defined above).

This may be expressed directly in terms of the notion of **homotopy group of a $G$-spectrum**: this is ...

### In terms of orthogonal spectra with $G$-action

... ([Schwede 15](#Schwede15))...

### In terms of Mackey-functors

A _[[Mackey functor]]_ with values in [[spectra]] ("spectral Mackey functor") is an [[(∞,1)-functor]] on a suitable  [[(∞,1)-category of correspondences]] 
$Corr_1^{eff}(\mathcal{C}) \hookrightarrow Corr_1(\mathcal{C})$ which sends [[coproducts]] to [[smash product]]. (This is similar to the concept of [[sheaf with transfer]].)

$$
  S \;\colon\; Corr_1^{eff}(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow Spectra
$$

For $G$ a [[finite group]] and $\mathcal{C}= G Set$ its category of [[permutation representations]], then $S$ is a genuine $G$-[[equivariant spectrum]] ([Guillou-May 11](#GuillouMay11)).
 So in this case the [[homotopy theory]] of spectral Mackey functors is a presentation for [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] ([Guillou-May 11](#GuillouMay11), [Barwick 14](#Barwick14)).

For $\mathcal{C}$ an [[abelian category]] this definition reduces ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) Mackey functors as originally defined in ([Dress 71](#Dress71)).

## Equivariant cohomology

The notion of [[cohomology]] relevant in equivariant stable homotopy theory is the flavor of [[equivariant cohomology]] (see there for details) called [[Bredon cohomology]].
