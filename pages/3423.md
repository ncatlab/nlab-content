## Definition

__$Loc$__ or **$Locale$** is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[locales]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous maps]] between locales.  By definition, this means that $Loc$ is the [[opposite category]] of [[Frm]], the category of [[frames]].

$Loc$ is used as a substitute for [[Top]] if one wishes to do [[topology]] with locales instead of standard [[topological spaces]].

$Loc$ is naturally a [[(1,2)-category]]; its [[2-morphism]] are the pointwise ordering of [[frame]] homomorphisms.

###### Definition

The [[2-category]] [[Locale]] has

* as [[object]]s $X$ [[frame]]s $Op(X)$;

* as [[morphisms]] $f : X \to Y$ frame homomorphisms $f^* : Op(Y) \to Op(X)$;

* a unique [[2-morphisms]] $f \Rightarrow g$ whenever for all $U \in Op(Y)$ we have a (then necessarily unique) morphism $f^* U \to g^* U$.

## Properties

For any [[base topos]] $E$ the [[2-category]] $Loc(S)$ of [[internal locales]] in $S$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[subcategory]] of the [[over topos|slice]] of [[Topos]] over $S$ on the [[localic geometric morphism]]s. See there for more details.

See [[locale]] for more properties.


The [[2-functor]] that formes [[category of sheaves|categories of sheaves]]

$$
  Sh : Locale \to Topos
$$

exhibits $Locale$ as a [[full sub-2-category]] of [[Topos]]. See _[[localic reflection]]_ for more on this.
