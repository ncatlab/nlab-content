## Definition

__$Loc$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[locales]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous maps]] between locales.  By definition, this means that $Loc$ is the [[opposite category]] of [[Frm]], the category of [[frames]].

$Loc$ is used as a substitute for [[Top]] if one wishes to do [[topology]] with locales instead of standard [[topological spaces]].

$Loc$ is naturally a [[(1,2)-category]]; its [[2-morphism]] are the pointwise ordering of [[frame]] homomorphisms. 

## Properties

For any base topos $E$ the 2-category $Loc(S)$ of locales in $S$ is equivalent to the subcatgeory of the slice of [[Topos]] over $S$ on the [[localic geometric morphism]]s. See there for more details.
