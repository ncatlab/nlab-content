__$Loc$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[locales]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous maps]] between locales.  By definition, this means that $Loc$ is the [[opposite category]] of [[Frm]], the category of [[frames]].

$Loc$ is used as a substitute for [[Top]] if one wishes to do [[topology]] with locales instead of standard [[topological spaces]].
