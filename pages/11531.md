## Idea

The **Arf-Kervaire invariant problem** asks whether certain hypothetical elements $\theta_j \in \pi^s_{2^{j+1} - 2}$ of the stable [[homotopy groups of spheres]] exist. In fact the definition of these elements works in all dimensions but due to a theorem of Browder they do not exist in dimensions $d\neq 2^{j+1} - 2$.

Prior to ([Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel 09](#HillHopkinsRavenel09)), all that was known rested on the explicit construction of such elements for $j=1,...,5$ (so in dimensions 2,6,14,30 and 62). HHR established that these elements do not exist for $j \gt 6$, so the only dimension in which existence remains unknown in 126 (ie $j=6$). The proof is by construction of a 256-periodic [[spectrum]] $\Omega$ and a [[spectral sequence]] for it that can detect the elements $\theta_j$ as elements of $\pi_*(\Omega)$. HHR then show that $\pi_n(\Omega)=0$ for $-4\lt n\lt 0$, which by the periodicity, implies that the images of $\theta_j$ must be elements of the trivial group, and hence are themselves trivial.
