## Idea

In [[logic]], a __predicate__  is a statement with (potentially) a [[free variable]] in it.  More specifically, a predicate in (say) the variables $x,y,z$ is a statement whose free variables may include $x$, $y$, and $z$; a predicate on (say) the [[type]]s $X,Y,Z$ is a statement whose free variables may include a variable of type $X$, a variable of type $Y$, and a variable of type $Z$.

The term **proposition** may be used synonymously with 'predicate', or it may be restricted to the case when there are *no* free variables.

In modern logic, it\'s often cleaner to speak of the propositions (or predicates) that can be stated in any given [[context]]; the context specifies the free variables available.


## In categorical logic

In the [[internal logic]] of a [[category]], [[type]]s are given by [[object]]s of the category predicates of type $T$ are given by [[subobject]]s $\phi \hookrightarrow T$.

We think of $T$ as the analogue of the "set" of possible values of variables $t$ and of $\phi$ as being the subset on those $t$ for which the statement $\phi(t)$ is [[true]].
