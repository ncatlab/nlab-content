## Idea

In the context of [[modal logic]], two key [[modalities]] that one wants to consider are those of _necessity_ and _possibility_.

The idea is to consider for any [[proposition]] $p$ 

* a proposition labeled $\Box p$ expressing the idea that "$p$ is necessarily true";

* a proposition labeled $\lozenge p$ expressing the idea that "$p$ is possibly true".

## The S4 axioms

For every [[modality]] one typically demands that it preserves implication, in that

* $\Box(p \to q) \to (\Box p \to \Box q)$

* $\lozenge (p \to q) \to (\lozenge p \to \lozenge q)$.

This preservation of implication is called the [[K modal logic|K-axiom]].  In traditional non-[[categorical logic]] this is often all that is considered, because in traditional classical modal logic, the operators are considered dual, i.e. $\Box A= \neg (\lozenge (\neg A))$.

A minimum requirement on a formalization of $\lozenge$ and $\Box$ with interpretation of "necessity" and "possibility" is arguably that there are [[implications]]

* $\Box p \rightarrow p$;

* $p \rightarrow \lozenge p$,

expressing that if something is necessarily true, then that should mean that it is true in all instances, and that if something is true in one instance, then it is evidently possible for it to be true. With this one speaks of [[T modal logic]].

By similar plausibility arguments one often demands that

* $\Box p \to \Box \Box p$

* $\lozenge \lozenge p \to \lozenge p$

which may be read as expressing that iterating the previous reasoning does not yield any new insight.

If one equips plain [[propositional logic]] with these additional modal operators satisfying these rules, then one speaks of _[[S4 modal logic]]_. 

### The generality of S4 

In terms of [[categorical logic]], the S4 axioms just say ([Bierman & de Paiva 92](#BiermanPaiva92)) that 

* $\Box$ is an ([[idempotent comonad|idempotent]]) [[comonad]];

* $\lozenge$ is an ([[idempotent monad|idempotent]]) [[monad]]

on the [[category]] ([[poset]]) of [[propositions]] (see at _[[monad in computer science]]_).  The above reasoning makes plausible that any operator expressing "necessity" and "possibility" should *at least* satisfy these (co)monad axioms, but not every (co)monad is sensibly interpreted this way.

For example there is

* the (idempotent) comonad $\emptyset$ which sends every proposition to [[false]] (the [[nothing|non-being]]-modality);

* the (idempotent) monad $\ast$ which sends every proposition to [[true]] (the [[being]]-modality).

These $\emptyset \dashv \ast$ satisfy all of the above axioms (as well as more axioms that are being considered, such as those called [[S5 modal logic]]) but they are not a very good interpretation of the informal concepts of "possibility" and "necessity".  Under this interpretation nothing is necessarily true, and everything is possibly true.  While this is not nonsensical, it is not very interesting and doesn't correspond well to our intuitive meanings of "necessary" and "possible".

This issue becomes more pronounced as one generalizes from the small realm of [[propositional logic]] to include both or either of:

* [[types]] more general than [[propositions]] (in [[modal type theory]]);

* [[first-order logic]] with [[quantifiers]], hence [[hyperdoctrines]]/[[dependent types]].

There are many [[modal operators]] in such contexts which are all modeled by (idempotent) (co)monads but which do not have the interpretation of expressing the modes of "necessity" or "possibility". See at _[[modal operator]]_ for some examples.

Therefore it makes sense to ask which _additional_ axioms on a modal operator make it an accurate formalization of the informal concepts of necessity and possibility.  The answer to this may depend on context and intention (after all one is trying to find a precise formulation of an a priori informal idea).

## Possible worlds via first-order logic and type theory
 {#InFirstOrderLogicAndTypeTheory}

One common philosophical interpretation of "necessarily" and "possibly" is in terms of a collection of "possible worlds" that are similar to the "real world", but not the same.  Under this interpretation, a proposition is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds, and possibly true if it is true in some possible world.

Now the idea of a proposition being true "necessarily in all possible cases" or "possibly at least in one case" is formally very well established in *predicate* logic: it is just the interpretation of the [[universal quantifier]] "for all" $\forall$ and of the [[existential quantifier]] "there exists" $\exists$.  In [[categorical logic]], these [[quantifiers]] (see there for details) are part of an [[adjoint triple]] whose middle piece is [[context]] extension, and as such they naturally induce a [[comonad]] and a [[monad]].  Thus, if we interpret "necessarily" and "possibly" in terms of possible worlds, we can model them by this base change adjoint triple.

### Globally

In more detail, let $W$ be the [[context]] [[type]] of [[variables]]/[[terms]] on which the propositions depend, i.e. the collection "of all [[possible worlds semantics|possible worlds]]".  Any specific choice of $W$ may be taken as specifying what is to be understood as a "possible world".

Writing $\mathbf{H}_{\ast}$ for the [[category]] of all context-free [[types]] under consideration and writing $\mathbf{H}_{/W}$ for the category of types in [[context]] "$W$", then in [[categorical logic]] (for instance $\mathbf{H}_{/(-)}$ might be a [[hyperdoctrine]] over a [[category of contexts]] containing objects $W$ and $\ast$) the [[quantifiers]] $\forall_{x\colon X}$ and $\exists_{x\colon X}$ participate in a [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]] 

$$
  (\exists_W \dashv W^\ast \dashv \forall_W)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
    \stackrel{\stackrel{\forall_{w \colon W}}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\stackrel{W^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\exists_{w\colon W}}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

In a context of pure [[logic]] this would be called

[[existential quantifier]] $\dashv$ [[context extension]] $\dashv$ [[universal quantifier]]

whereas in a context of [[dependent type theory]] this would be called

[[dependent sum]] $\dashv$ [[context extension]] $\dashv$ [[dependent product]].

In either case, under the suitable version of [[propositions as types]] (and using [[bracket types]] etc. if desired), the operations $\forall$ and $\exists$ have the usual interpretation of "for all" and "there exists".

Note, however, that these operations change the context from $W$ to $\ast$.  In other words, if a proposition $P$ depends on $W$, so that it may be true in some worlds and false in others, then $\exists_W P$ and $\forall_W P$ no longer depend on $W$.  The idea of a necessity and a possibility modality is to send a proposition in some context to a proposition in the *same* context, so that we can for instance say that $\Box P \to P$ and so on.  Thus we need to make $\exists_W P$ and $\forall_W P$ into propositions that again depend on $W$ --- even if they now depend trivially on $W$, being [[context extension|extended]] back from the absolute context $\ast$ to $W$.

This is just what is accomplished by passing from the above [[adjoint triple]] to the induced [[adjoint pair]] on $\mathbf{H}_{/W}$ by forming composites with the [[context extension]] operation $W^\ast$

$$
  (\underset{W}{\lozenge} \dashv \underset{W}{\Box})
  \coloneqq
  \left(
     \left(
     W^\ast \circ \underset{w\colon W}{\exists}
     \right)
     \dashv
     \left(
     W^\ast \circ \underset{w\colon W}{\forall}
     \right)
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
  \,.
$$

With this, if $p\in \mathbf{H}_{/W}$ is a [[proposition]] about terms $w$ of $W$ (a $W$-[[dependent type]]) then 

* $\underset{W}{\lozenge}(p)$ is [[true]]/[[inhabited type|inhabited]] precisely if $\underset{w \colon W}{\exists} p(w)$ is [[true]]/[[inhabited type|inhabited]], hence (that is the standard interpretation of the [[quantifier]]) if it is possible for $p(w)$ to be true for some $w$;

* $\underset{W}{\Box}(p)$ is [[true]]/[[inhabited type|inhabited]] precisely if $\underset{w \colon W}{\forall} p(w)$ is [[true]]/[[inhabited type|inhabited]], hence (that is again the standard interpretation of the quantifier) if $p(w)$ necessarily holds for all $w$.

(Note that there is also an adjoint pair on $\mathbf{H}_{/\ast}$ in which the left adjoint is given by context extension back to $\mathbf{H}_{/W}$ followed by $\exists_W$, and dually the right adjoint is given by $W^\ast$ followed by $\forall_W$.  However, these modalities are not as interesting and do not very well represent necessity and possibility.)

Thus, this gives one [[syntax|syntactic]] formalization of the informal meaning of "necessity" and "possibility".  The natural [[semantics]] for these [[base change]] operations is a generalization of the simple traditional _[[possible worlds semantics]]_ of propositional necessity and possibility modalities.  (There are, however, more complicated possible worlds semantics.)

Moreover, with this formalization, the modal operator $\underset{W}{\lozenge}$ is [[left adjoint]] to $\underset{W}{\Box}$ and hence both form an [[adjoint modality]]. As discussed there, this is a formalization of [[unity of opposites|opposite]] concepts, which reflects well the opposition of necessity and possibility in their informal meaning.

Some technical remarks:

1. In general, $\underset{W}{\lozenge}$ and $\underset{W}{\Box}$ as defined above are, while being a [[monad]] and [[comonad]], respectively, not an [[idempotent monad]] and [[idempotent comonad]] if generalized from [[first-order hyperdoctrines]] to more general [[dependent type theories]]. But this just reflects the usual issues with [[propositions as types]], see there for more discussion.

1. While [[base change]]-[[adjunctions]] are essentially unique and not free to choose, there is a genuine choice in the above given by the choice of [[context]] $W$. This is reflected in the subscripts of $\underset{W}{\lozenge}$ and $\underset{W}{\Box}$ above. It is the choice of this $W$ that gives different kinds of possibility and necessity. More generally there is in fact not just a choice of a context, but of a morphism of contexts, reflecting what is often called "accessibility of possible worlds". This we come to [below](#ViaBaseChangeRelatively).

### Relatively
  {#ViaBaseChangeRelatively}

With this axiomatization via [[base change]], it is immediate to consider the relative case where instead of [[base change]] to a [[unit type]] $W \to \ast$ one considers [[base change]] 

$$
  (\exists_\omega \dashv \omega^\ast \dashv \forall_\omega)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
    \stackrel{\stackrel{\forall_{w \colon \omega^{-1}(-)}}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\stackrel{\omega^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\exists_{w\colon \omega^{-1}(-)}}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/W_0}
  \,.
$$

along any [[morphism]] 

$$
  \omega \colon W \longrightarrow W_0
$$

and set

$$
  (\underset{\omega}{\lozenge} \dashv \underset{\omega}{\Box})
  \coloneqq
  \left(
     \left(
     \omega^\ast \circ \underset{w\colon \omega^{-1}(-)}{\exists}
     \right)
     \dashv
     \left(
     \omega^\ast \circ \underset{w\colon \omega^{-1}(-)}{\forall}
     \right)
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
  \,.
$$

If here $\omega$ is an [[effective epimorphism]] (a [[1-epimorphism]]) then it exibits an [[equivalence relation]] on $W$, where $w_1\sim w_2$ is given by $\omega(w_1) = \omega(w_2)$. In traditional [[possible worlds semantics]] such equivalence relation is called an "accessibility relation between possible worlds". Now 

*  $\underset{\omega}{\lozenge} p$ is true/inhabited at $w\in W$ iff it is true/inhabited at at least one $\tilde w$ in the same equivalence class of $w$;

*  $\underset{\omega}{\Box} p$ is true/inhabited at $w\in W$ iff it is true/inhabited at all $\tilde w$ in the same equivalence classes of $w$.
