## Idea

The [[D-brane]] of [[dimension]] $5+1$ in [[type IIB string theory]]. 

## Properties

### Black hole entropy

At low string coupling [[D1-D5 brane bound states]] are described by 2d [[CFT]], which is well understood. After passage to the corresponding strongly coupled [[black brane]] configurations in [[type IIB supergravity]], which are [[black hole]]s in the given [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]], the [[entropy]] of these 2d CFTs matches the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of these black holes.

This is parts of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. See ([AGMOO, chapter 5](#AGMOO)).
