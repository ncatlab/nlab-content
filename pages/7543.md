## Idea

The _Segal condition_ is a condition on a [[simplicial object]] $X_\bullet \in \mathcal{C}^{\Delta^{op}}$ which says that each component $X_{n \geq 2} \in \mathcal{C}$ is obtained from $X_1 \stackrel{\overset{\partial_0}{\to}}{\underset{\partial_1}{\to}} X_0$ by the $n$-fold [[fiber product]] of $X_1$ over $X_0$ which "glues" $n$ copies of $X_1$ end-to-end.

Hence if one thinks of $X_0$ as a collection of [[objects]] and of $X_1$ as a collection of [[morphisms]], then $X_\bullet$ satisfies the Segal condition precisely if each $X_{n \geq 2}$ can be interpreted as the collection of sequences of [[composition|composable]] morphisms of length $n$. The precise formulation is below in _[Definition -- For simplicial objects](#ForSimplicialObjects)_.

Accordingly, if $\mathcal{C} = $ [[Set]] is the category of [[sets]], then the Segal condition characterizes precisely those [[simplicial sets]] which are the [[nerve]] of a [[small category]], theorem \ref{NerveTheorem} below. This is the observation due to ([Segal 1968](#Segal)), following [[Grothendieck]], which today gives the Segal condition its name. Sometimes this statement also called the _nerve theorem_ (no relation to what is called _[[nerve theorem]]_ in [[homotopy theory]]).

It is useful to decompose this statement into its constituents as follows: 

A [[small category]] $C$ may be thought of as a [[directed graph]] $U(C)$ equipped with a [[unit law|unital]] [[associativity|associative]] [[composition]] operation. This corresponds to a sequence of inclusions of [[sites]]

$$
  (1 \stackrel{\overset{d_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{d_1}{\leftarrow}} 0) \hookrightarrow \Delta_0 \to \Delta
$$

into the [[simplex category]], where $\Delta_0$ is the category of finite non-empty directed linear graphs:

* a [[directed graph]] is equivalently a [[presheaf]] on $(1 \stackrel{\overset{d_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{d_1}{\leftarrow}} 0)$;

* a [[presheaf]] on $\Delta$, hence a [[simplicial set]] encodes via its face and degeneracy maps a kind of associative and unital composition -- but not necessarily "of composable morphisms" if $X_{n\geq 2}$ is not given in the above fashion.

In terms of this we can say that equipping a directed graph with the structure of a category is equivalent to asking for its pushforward along $(1 \stackrel{\overset{d_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{d_1}{\leftarrow}} 0) \hookrightarrow \Delta_0$ (which encodes all the collections of sequences of composable edges) to be equipped with a lift to a simplicial object through the pullback along $\Delta_0 \to \Delta$. Conversely, the simplicial objects obtained as such lifts are precisely the simplicial objects that satisfy the Segal condition.

Formulated in this way one sees that the Segal condition has a large variety of generalizations to structures with richer kinds of composition operations, such as [[globular operads]]. This is made precise below in _[Definition -- For presheaves on globular theories](#ForPresheavesOnGlobularTheories)_.

## Definition

### For simplicial objects 
 {#ForSimplicialObjects}

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] with [[pullbacks]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[simplicial object]] 

$$
  X : \Delta^{op} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

is said to satisfy the **Segal condition** if it sends the [[colimits]] in the [[simplex category]] to [[limits]], hence if 

$$
  X_n 
   \simeq 
  \underbrace{
    X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1
  }_{n\; factors}
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

=--

More in detail:

+-- {: .num_defn #SegalCones}
###### Definition

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider $\Delta[n]$ naturally as a [[cocone]] in the [[simplex category]] under the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     \Delta[0] && && \Delta[0] && && \Delta[0] &&& \cdots
      \\
      & {}_{\mathllap{d_1}}\searrow && {}^{\mathllap{d_0}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{d_0}} && {}_{d_1}\swarrow && \cdots
      \\
      && \Delta[1] &&&& \Delta[1] && \cdots 
  }
$$

with $n$ copies of $\Delta[1]$ at the bottom, such that the cocone injection of the $k$th copy is $\Delta[1] \simeq (k-1,k) \hookrightarrow (0,1,2, \cdots, n) \simeq \Delta[n]$.

A [[simplicial object]] $X \colon \Delta^{op} \to \mathcal{C}$ satisfies the **Segal conditions** if it sends these cocones to [[limit]] [[cones]] in $\mathcal{C}$. 


=--



+-- {: .num_remark #InfinitySegalCones}
###### Remark

This definition immediately generalizes to [[(∞,1)-category theory]] where $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[(∞,1)-category]] and $X$ is a [[simplicial object in an (∞,1)-category]]. Then for $X$ to satisfy the Segal condiitons means that it sends the cocones of def. \ref{SegalCones} to [[(∞,1)-limit]] cones in $\mathcal{C}$.

Such a simplicial object is also called a **[[pre-category object in an (∞,1)-category]]** in $\mathcal{C}$.

## Properties

### Characterization of nerves of small categories

The archetypical role of the Segal condition is to make the following statement true.

+-- {: .num_theorem #NerveTheorem}
###### Theorem
**(nerve theorem)**

A [[simplicial set]] is the [[nerve]] of a [[small category]] precisely if it satsfies the Segal conditions.

=--

This is due to ([Segal 1968](#Segal)), following [[Grothendieck]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is an entirely unrelated theorem in [[homotopy theory]] also often called "the" _[[nerve theorem]]_. See there for more. Not to be confused with the discussion here.

=--

### In terms of sheaf conditions

We discuss an equivalent formulation of the Segal condition in terms of notion in [[topos theory]]/[[(∞,1)-topos theory]]. This perspective lends itself more to a formulation of Segal conditions in terms of the [[internal logic]] of toposes.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The condition in def. \ref{SegalCones} superficially looks like a [[sheaf]] condition for [[coverings]] of $\Delta[n]$ by $n$ subsequent copies of $\Delta[1]$. However, these coverings do _not_ form a [[coverage]] on the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$: the refinement-of-covers-axiom is not satisfied:

For instance for $d_1 \colon \Delta[1] \to \Delta[2]$ the map that sends the single edge of $\Delta[1]$ to the composite edge in $\Delta[2]$ there is no way to "pull back" the cover 

$$
  \{\Delta[1] \coprod \Delta[1] \stackrel{((0,1),(1,2))}{\to} \Delta[2]\}
$$ 

along this morphism, not even in the weak sense of _[[coverage]]_.

However, as this example also makes clear, the problem is precisely only with the morphisms in $\Delta$ that are no injective on generating edges.

=--

Therefore consider instead the following:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $\Delta_0 \hookrightarrow Graph$ be the [[full subcategory]] of that of [[directed graphs]] on the linear graphs $\{0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Morphisms in $\Delta_0$ have to send elementary edges to elementary edges. For instance there are precisely $n$ morphisms $\Delta_0[1] \to \Delta_0[n]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Taking the cocones of def. \ref{SegalCones} as [[coverings]] constitutes a [[coverage]] on $\Delta_0$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[presheaf]] $X \colon \Delta_0^{op} \to \mathcal{C}$ is a [[sheaf]] with respect to this coverage precisely if it is in the essential image of the moprhism

$$
  Graph(\mathcal{C})
  \coloneqq
  \mathcal{C}^{(1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} 0)} \to \mathcal{C}^{\Delta_0^{op}}
$$

which sends a [[directed graph]] $E \stackrel{\overset{t}{\to}}{\underset{s}{\to} }V$ to the [[presheaf]] which sends $\Delta[2]$ to $E {}_t\times{}_s E$, etc.

Hence we have an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Graph(\mathcal{C})
  \simeq
  Sh(\Delta_0)
  \,.
$$

=--

In terms of this theorem \ref{NerveTheorem} says the following:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[commuting diagram]] of [[1-categories]]

$$
  \array{
    Cat &\stackrel{N}{\to}& PSh(\Delta)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Graph \simeq Sh(\Delta_0) &\hookrightarrow& PSh(\Delta_0)
  }
  \,,
$$

where

* the top horizontal morphism forms the [[nerve of a category]];

* the left vertical morphism sends a category to its underlying graph, [[forgetful functor|forgetting]] [[composition]] and [[identity]]-assignments;

* the right vertical morphism analogously forgets [[inner Kan complex|inner horn]] fillers etc. and degeneracies

is a [[pullback]].
