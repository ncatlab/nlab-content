## Idea

[[Gabriel's theorem]] says that connected [[quivers]] of finite type are precisely those whose underlying [[undirected graph]] is a [[Dynkin diagram]] in the ADE series, and that the indecomposable [[quiver representations]] are in [[bijection]] with the positive roots in the [[root system]] of the Dynkin diagram. ([Gabriel 72](#Gabriel72)).
