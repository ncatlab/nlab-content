## Definition

For $C$ and $D$ [[monoidal model categories]], a **lax monoidal Quillen adjunction**

$$
  (L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}}
  D
$$

is

* a [[Quillen adjunction]] $(L \dashv R)$ between the underlying [[model categories]];

* equipped with the structure of a [[lax monoidal functor]] on $R$ with respect to the underlying [[monoidal categories]]

* such that the induced structure of an [[oplax monoidal functor]] on $L$ satisfies:

  1. for all cofibrant objects $x,y \in D$ the oplax monoidal transformation

     $$
       L(x \otimes y) \to L(x) \otimes L(y)
     $$

     is a weak equivalence in $C$    

  1. for some (hence any) cofibrant [[resolution]] $q : \hat I_D \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} I_D$ of the monoidal unit object in $D$, the composite

     $$
       L(\hat I_D) \stackrel{L(q)}{\to} L(I_D) \to I_C
     $$

     is a weak equivalence in $C$.

This is called a **strong monoidal Quillen adjunction** if $L$ is a [[strong monoidal functor]]. 

If a monoidal Quillen adjunction is also a [[Quillen equivalence]] it is called a **monoidal Quillen equivalence**.

## Properties

### Recognition of monoidal Quillen adjunctions {#Recognition}

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $(L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} D$ be a [[Quillen adjunction]] between [[monoidal model categories]] and let $R$ be equipped with the strcuture of a [[lax monoidal functor]].

Then the following two conditions are sufficient for $(L \dashv R)$ to be a lax monoidal Quillen adjunction:

1. for some (hence any) cofibrant [[resolution]] $q : \hat I_D \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} D$ of the unit object in $D$, the composite morphism

   $$
     L(\hat I_D) \stackrel{L(q)}{\to} L(I_D) \stackrel{\tilde i}{\to} I_C
   $$

   is a weak equivalence, (wher $\tilde i$ is the [[adjunct]] of $i : I_D \to R(I_C)$);

1. the unit object $I_D$ _detects weak equivalences_ in that for every weak equivalence $f : X \to Y$ between fibrant objects the morphism $D^{\Delta^{op}}(Q I_D, f)$ of [[hom-object]]s in the category of [[simplicial object]]s in $D$ is an equivalence of Kan complexes, for $Q I_D$ a cofibrant resolution in the [[Reedy model structure]] $D^{\Delta^{op}}_{Reedy}$. 

=--

This is proposition 3.16 in ([SchwedeShipley](#SchwedeShipley)).




### Lift to Quillen adjunctions on monoids {#LiftToMonoids}

For $C$ and $D$ [[monoidal model categories]] we may ask if on their categories of [[monoid]]s exist the corresponding [[transferred model structure]]s, transferred along the [[stuff, structure, property|forgetful]]/[[free functor]] adjunction 

$$
  (F_C \dashv U_C) : Mon(C) \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}}
  C
  \,.
$$

For the purposes of the following statement, we define

+-- {: .un_def #CreatedModelStructure}
###### Definition

We say a model category structure on $Mon(C)$ is _created_ by $U_C$ is

* it is the [[transferred model structure]];

* every cofibrant object in $Mon(C)$ is a [[retract]] of a [[cell object]].

###### Theorem

Let $(L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} D$ be a lax monoidal Quillen adjunction between [[monoidal model categories]] with cofibrant unit obects.


If the forgetful functors $U_C$ and $U_D$ [create](#CreatedModelStructure) a model structures on monoids, then there is an induced [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  (L^{mon} \dashv R) 
  : 
  Mon(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} Mon(D)
  \,,
$$

where the functor underlying the [[right adjoint]] is the original $R$. 


The left adjoint $L^{mon}$ is the functor given by forming the [[coequalizer]]s

$$
  L^{mon} : B 
    \mapsto 
   \lim_{\to}
  (F_D L F_C B \stackrel{\to}{\to} F_D L B)
$$

of the following two morphisms (...)

=--

This is theorem 3.12 in ([SchwedeShipley](#SchwedeShipley)). Its proof uses the following technical lemmas

+-- {: .un_lemma #OneTechnicalLemma}
###### Lemma

Let $(L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} D$ be a monoidal Quillen adjunction between monoidal model categories with cofibrant unit objects.

Suppose the adjunction

$$
  (L^{mon} \dashv R) 
  : 
  Mon(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} Mon(D)
$$

described above exists (just as an adjunction, not yet assumed to be a Quillen adjunction). Then for every monoid $B \in Mon(D)$ which is an $(L^\mon \dashv R)$-[[cell object]], the [[adjunct]]

$$
 \chi_B :  L B \to L^{mon} B
$$

to the morphism underlying the unit $B \to R L^{mon} B$ is a weak equivalence.

=--

This is proposition 5.1 in ([SchwedeShipley](#SchwedeShipley)).

###### Proof

+-- {: .un_lemma #AnotherTechnicalLemma}
###### Lemma

If $U_C$ [creates](#CreatedModelStructure) the model structure on $Mon(C)$ and the unit in $C$ is cofibrant,  then a cofibrant $C$-monoid is also cofibrant as an object in $C$.

This is 6.2 in ([SchwedeShipleyAlgebras](#SchwedeShipleyAlgebras))

###### Proof

###### Proof of the theorem


For any cofibrant $B \in Mon(D)$  and fibrant $Y \in Mon(C)$ we have to show that a morphism $B \to R Y$ is a weak equivalence precisely if its adjunct $L^{mon} B \to Y$ is in $Mon(C)$.

The adjunct of the the underlying morphism of $B \to R Y$ $C$ is the composite

$$
  L B \stackrel{\chi_B}{\to} L^{mon} B \to Y
$$ 
 
in $D$. 

Since by assumption the model structure on $Mon(D)$ is [created](#CreatedModelStructure) by $U_D$ it follows by definition that the cofibrant $B$ is a [[retract]] of a [[cell object]] in $Mon(D)$. Then the [above lemma](#OneTechnicalLemma) asserts that

$$
  \chi_B : L B \to L^{mon} B
$$

is a weak equivalence. 

Since the unit $I_D$ is by assumption cofibrant, it follows by the [above lemma](#AnotherTechnicalLemma) that a cofibrant $D$-monoid is also cofibrant as an object in $D$.

Therefore the fact that $(L \dashv R)$ is a [[Quillen equivalence]] implies that $L B \to L^{mon} B \to Y$ is a weak equivalence precisely if its $(L \dashv R)$-adjunct $B \to R Y$ is, which is the statement we have to show.
