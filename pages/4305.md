Given a [[vector space]] $V$, the $n$-fold [[tensor product]] of this space with itself, $V \otimes \cdots \otimes V$, is usually denoted $V^{\otimes n}$ and called the $n$th **tensor power** of $V$.  

More generally, given any [[monoidal category]] $C$ --- that is, roughly, a category with tensor products ---  we can form the $n$th tensor power $x^{\otimes n}$ of any object $x \in C$.  We can also form the $n$th tensor power of any morphism $f : x \to y$, obtaining a morphism $f^{\otimes n} : x^{\otimes n} \to y^{\otimes n}$.  This process defines a functor 
$$       (-)^{\otimes n} : C \to C $$
which could be called the $n$th **tensor power** functor.

If $C$ is a suitable [[linear category]], the $n$th tensor power functor is a simple example of a [[Schur functor]].

The sum of all of the tensor powers of $V$ is the __tensor algebra__ of $V$.
