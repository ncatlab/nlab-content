## Idea

The name for an  [[instanton]] [[gauge field]] configuration in $SU(2)$-[[Yang-Mills theory]] (describing the [[weak nuclear force]]).

The BPTS construction considers -- on a 4-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]] [[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]] to the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^4$ -- [[gauge field]] configurations for [[gauge group]] the [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$ that have vanishing [[field strength]] outside some finite radius. These are then equivalently configurations on the 4-[[sphere]]. The BPTS instanton is the $SU(2)$-gauge field whose underlying $SU(2)$-[[principal bundle]]  has [[second Chern class]]=instanton number equal to $\pm1 \in \mathbb{Z} \simeq H^4(S^4, \mathbb{Z})$.

The physics literature typically focuses on describing this $SU(2)$-bundle in terms of the [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] which after [[covering]] the 4-sphere with two 4-[[balls]] (two "hemispheres") is given by an $SU(2)$-vaued transition function on the intersection of these two balls, which has the [[homotopy type]] of the 3-spehere. Since also the [[manifold]] underlying the [[special unitary group|special unitary]] [[Lie group]] $SU(2)$ is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to $S^3$, this allows to encode the classes of $SU(2)$-[[principal bundles]]/$SU(2)$-instantons on $S^4$ in terms of [[homotopy classes]] of maps $S^3 \to S^3$, and this is what much of the literature focuses on.
