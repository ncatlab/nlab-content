If $V$ is a [[monoidal category]], the **unit $V$-category** is the $V$-[[enriched category]] $\mathcal{I}$ having one [[object]], say $\star$, with $\mathcal{I}(\star,\star)=I$, the monoidal unit object of $V$, and the composition and identity-assigning morphisms being the canonical coherence isomorphism $I\otimes I\cong I$ and the identity arrow $id_I$, respectively.

The $V$-category $\mathcal{I}$ plays a role in enriched category theory that is similar to the role played by the [[terminal category]] in ordinary unenriched category theory.  (In fact, the terminal category is the unit $Set$-category.)  For instance, objects of a $V$-category $\mathcal{A}$ can be identified with $V$-functors $\mathcal{I}\to\mathcal{A}$.
