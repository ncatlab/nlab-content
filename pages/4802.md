## Idea

A _vielbein_ or _soldering form_ on a [[manifold]] $X$ is a linear identification of a [[tangent bundle]] with a [[vector bundle]] with explicit [[orthogonal structure]].

Any such choice encodes a [[Riemannian metric]] on $X$. 

## Definition

### In terms of $iso$-connections

A [[Lie algebra valued 1-form]]

$$
  (E,\Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d)
$$

with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] encodes a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$. In this context the component 

$$
  E : T X \to \mathbb{R}^d
$$

of the [[connection on a bundle|connection]] 1-form is called the _vielbein_ . It encodes the metric by

$$
  g = \langle E \otimes E\rangle  \in Sym^2_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)
  \,,
$$

where $\langle -,-\rangle : \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ is the canonical [[bilinear form]].

For $d=4$ this is the _vierbein_ , for $d = 3$ the _dreibein_ , etc.

This terminology is used in the [[first-order formulation of gravity]]. 

Globally we have that a $O(n) \hookrightarrow iso(n)$-[[Cartan connection]] on a manifold $X$ encodes a vielbein and compatible [[spin connection]].

### In terms of orthogonal structure / reduction of structure group

We discuss here how a choice of vielbein on a [[manifold]] is equivalently the [[reduction of structure groups|reduction of the structure group]] of the [[tangent bundle]] from the [[general linear group]] $GL(n)$ to its [[maximal compact subgroup]], the [[orthogonal group]].


#### The class of the tangent bundle
 {#ClassOfTheTangentBundle}

For completeness, we first review how the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[smooth manifold]] is naturally incarnated as a [[cocycle]] in $GL(n)$-valued [[Cech cohomology]] and how this in turn is naturally formulated in terms of [[Lie groupoids]]/[[differentiable stack|smooth]] [[moduli stacks]]. The reader familiar with these basics should skip to the [next section](#ReductionOfTheStructureGroup).

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$. 

By definition this means that there is an [[atlas]] $\{\phi_i^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^n \simeq U_i \hookrightarrow X\}$ of [[coordinate charts]]. On each overlap $U_i \cap U_j$ of two [[coordinate charts]] the [[partial derivatives]] of the corresponding [[coordinate transformations]]

$$
  \phi_j\circ \phi_i^{-1}
  : 
  U_i \cap U_j \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

form the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[smooth functions]]

$$
  ((\lambda_{i j})^{\mu}{}_{\mu})
  \coloneqq
  \left[\frac{d}{d x^\nu} \phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1} (x^\mu)
  \right]
  :
  U_i \cap U_j 
  \to 
  GL_n
$$

with values in invertible [[matrices]], hence in the
[[general linear group]] $GL(n)$. By construction (by the [[chain rule]]), these functions satisfy on triple overlaps of coordinate charts the equations

$$
  (\lambda_{i j})^\mu{}_\lambda (\lambda_{j k})^\lambda{}_{\nu} 
  = 
  (\lambda_{i k})^\mu{}_{\nu}
  \,,
$$

hence the equation

$$
  \lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}
$$

in $C^\infty(U_i \cap U_j, GL(n))$

This is the [[cocycle]] condition for a [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] in degree 1 with coefficients in $GL(n)$

$$
  [(\lambda_{i j})] \in H^1_{smooth}(X, GL_n)
  \,.
$$

It is useful to formulate this statement in the language of [[Lie groupoids]]/[[differentiable stacks]]. 

* $X$ itself is trivially a Lie groupoid;

* from the atlas $\{U_i \to X\}$ we get the corresponding [[Cech groupoid]] $C(\{U_i\})$;

* any [[Lie group]] $G$ induces its [[delooping]] groupoid $\mathbf{B}G$.

The above situation is then neatly encoded in the existence of a diagram of Lie groupoids of the form

$$
  \array{
     C(\{U_i\}) &\stackrel{\lambda}{\to}& \mathbf{B} GL(n).
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
$$

For short we may write such morphisms as

$$
  T X : X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n) \;\; \in \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

Since all real [[vector bundles]] on $X$ are encoded by such morphisms, we say that $\mathbf{B} GL(n)$ is the [[moduli stack]] for real vector bundles. 

Of course there is a "smaller" Lie groupoid that also classifies real vector bundles. Passing to this "smaller" Lie groupoid is what the choice of vielbein accomplishes, to which we now turn.


#### Reduction of the structure group
 {#ReductionOfTheStructureGroup}


Consider the defining inclusion of the [[orthogonal group]] into the [[general linear group]]

$$
  O(n) \hookrightarrow GL(n)
  \,.
$$

We may understand this inclusion geometrically in terms of the canonical [[metric]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$, but we may also understand it purely Lie theoretically as the
the inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]] of $GL(n)$. This makes manifest that the inclusion is trivial at the level of [[homotopy theory]] (it is a [[homotopy equivalence]]) and hence _only_ encodes geometric information.


The inclusion induces a corresponding morphism of moduli stacks

$$
  \mathbf{B} O(n) \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)
  \,.
$$


A choice of [[orthogonal structure]] on $T X$ is a factorization of the above $GL(n)$-valued cocycle through $\mathbf{c}$, up to a smooth [[homotopy]].

$$
  \array{
     X &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& \mathbf{B} O(n)
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\lambda}}\searrow &\swArrow_{E}& \swarrow
     \\
     && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

This consists of two pieces of data

* the morphism $h$ is a $O(n)$-valued 1-cocycle -- a collection of _orthogonal transition functions_ --  hence on each overlap of coordinate patches a smooth function
  
  $$
    ((h_{i j}){}^a{}_b) : U_i \cap U_j \to O(n)
  $$
  
  such that 

  $$
    h_{i j} \cdot h_{j k} = h_{i k}
    \,;
  $$

* the homotopy $E$ is on each chart a function

$$
  E_i  = ((E_i)^a{}_\mu) : U_i \to GL(n)
$$

* such that on each double overlap it intertwines the transition functions $\lambda$ of the tangent bundle with the new orthogonal transition functions, meaning that the equation

  $$
    E^a{}_{\mu} \lambda^{\mu}{}_\nu
    =
    h^a{}_b E^b{}_\nu
  $$

  holds. This exhibits the [[natural transformation|naturality]] [[diagram]] of $E$:

  $$
    \array{
       * &\stackrel{E_i}{\to}& * 
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{h_{i j}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\lambda_{i j}}}
       \\
       * &\stackrel{E_j}{\to}& * 
    }
  $$

This $E$ is the **vielbein**.

#### The moduli space of orthogonal structures

$$
  \array{  
    GL(n)/O(n) &\to& \mathbf{B} O(n)
    \\
    && \donwnarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} GL(n)
  }
$$

The [[groupoid]] / [[moduli stack]] of orthogonal structures is the groupoid of "$TX$-twisted" $\mathbf{c}$-structure" (in the sense discussed [[twisted differential c-structure|here]]), the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{c}Struc_{TX}(X)
    &\to&
    * 
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{e}^\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{T X}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B} O(n))
    &\stackrel{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{c})}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B} GL(n))
  }
  \,.
$$

An object in $\mathbf{c} Struc_{TX}$ is

* a choice of $O(n)$-[[principal bundle]] $P : X \to \mathbf{B} O(n)$ on $X$;

* a choice of [[isomorphism]] of $T X$ with $P$ as $GL(n)$-principal bundles

  $$
    e : T X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} P 
    \,.
  $$

This is the vielbein. Over a [[coordinate patch]] $\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to X$ with respect to the induced trivialization of $T X$ and a given chosen trivialization of $P$, this is a [[matrix]]-valued function

$$
  e|_\phi = \{e^q{}_{\mu}\}
  \,.
$$

Next, a [[morphism]] in $\mathbf{c}Struc_{T X}$ is an $O(n)$-[[gauge transformation]] of $P$ and hence of $e$.

Therefore the [[truncated|0-truncation]] of $\mathbf{c}Struc_{T X}$ is the space of [[Riemannian metrics]] / [[orthogonal structures]] on $X$.


#### Differential refinement: Spin connection

We may further lift this discussion to [[differential cohomology]] to get genuine _differential_ $T X$-twisted $\mathbf{c}$-structures. 

$$
  \array{
    GL(n)/ O(n) &\to& \mathbf{B} O(n)_{conn}
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} GL(n)_{conn}
  }
$$

This introduces in addition the [[Levi-Civita connection]] in $X$ with respect to the given vielbein.
