What is known as the _prime number theorem_ is a description of the [[asymptotic]] distribution of [[prime numbers]].

## Related concepts

* An [[analogy|analog]] of the theorem exists for [[prime geodesics]] in [[hyperbolic manifolds]], accordingly called the _[[prime geodesic theorem]]_. Just as the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] control the error term in the prime number theorem, so the zeros of the [[Selberg zeta function]] control the error term in the prime geodesic theorem.
