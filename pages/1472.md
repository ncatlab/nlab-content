This entry lists and discusses applications and occurences of [[higher category theory]] in [[physics]].

# General considerations #

>[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I inserted the following quick rough sketch just as a catalyst for further development/criticism/revision, without really taking or even having the time to do justice to this topic. I don't have the time and energy right now to run with this ball, but I thought I'd give it a kick anyway.

At this time, a systematic and comprehensive $n$-categorical formulation of fundamental physics, that was expected in one form or other for many years, is gradually beginning to take concrete shape in structures revolving around the concept of [[FQFT|extended quantum field theory]].

Given the current evidence there is some reason to expect that eventually [[higher category theory]] in general and [[(infinity,n)-category]] theory in particular will find its role as the natural language for [[quantum field theory]] and all that entails in much the same way as, for instance, in the past

* [[differential geometry]] turned out to be the natural language for [[Maxwell theory]] and [[Einstein gravity]];

* [[symplectic geometry]] turned out to be the natural language for [[Hamiltonian mechanics]];

* etc.

For instance just recently with the [[generalized tangle hypothesis]] taking concrete shape we are seeing 

* [[geometric infinity-function theory]] as a natural language for (at least topological) [[sigma-model]] quantum field theory.

If we take the presently available evidence of the picture that is emerging here, then it appears that all $n$-categorical phenomena in physics that have been identified already in the past may be fit into and organized according to the following pattern:

* **0th quantization: classical physics**: quantization is quantization of "action functionals". Action functionals in fundamental physics tend to arise in the form of holonomies of higher [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|differential cocycles]]. For instance the Chern-Simons action functional is the 3-dimensional holonomy of a $U(1)$ 2-gerbe, the Wess-Zumino model term the 2-dimensional holonomy of a 1-gerbe, and the gauge coupling term of the ordinary charged particle (an electron, or a quark) the ordinary holonomy of a bundle with connection. So  0th quantized physics is about parallel transport $n$-functors $\nabla$ that send "classical trajectories" to the "phases" assigned to them by the "gauge coupling". So 0th quantization is controled by $n$-functors of the form

  * classical action: target space $\to$ phases

* **1st quantization: quantum mechanics**: it has become [[FQFT|clear]] that the quantum field theory that described the propagation of a fundamental $(n-1)$-brane (or "$n$-particle") is encoded in an $n$-functor from an [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]] to some suitable codomain.  This sends "worldvolumes"  to "correlators". So first quantization is controled by $n$-functors of the form

  * quantum propagation: cobordisms/Feynman diagrams $\to$ correlators

* **2nd quantization: quantum field theory**: quantum mechanical propagation functors as above that arise by quantizing classical data, i.e. that arise as [[sigma-model]]s typically compute the amplitude assigned to as a cobordism a sum of phases over classical trajectories. This pattern continues: in [[string theory|second quantization]] one constructs "$S$-matrix elements" by summing amplitudes over cobordisms/Feynman diagrams. This is by far the least developed bit, but it seems we want to say that the $n$-functor relevant for second quantized quantum field theory here is of the kind

  * scattering amplitude: reaction channel $\to$ $S$-matrix element

We will now list $n$-categorical physics ordered according to this rough pattern of successive quantization.

> the following a stub obtained from copy-and-pasting material that [[David Ben-Zvi]] mentioned [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/a_prehistory_of_ncategorical_p_1.html#c025075)

Kontsevich’s 1994 ICM article, is one of the seminal papers of the 1990s. This paper invented the categorical side of mirror symmetry (homological mirror symmetry), discovered D-[[brane]]s (before physicists realized their role - and directly inspiring many physicists) and the fact that they naturally form [[dg-category|dg-categories]] and [[A-infinity-category]], and thus led to a deluge of papers involving [[category theory]] and [[higher category theory]] in close relation with mathematical physics.

In particular the Moore-Segal paper should be seen in the light of this development. On a similar note, roughly contemporary with Moore-Segal (which is arXiv:math/0609042 though developed earlier) are the works of Costello (arXiv:math/0412149) and Kontsevich-Soibelman (arXiv:math/0606241 — some of the results were lectured on in various places by Kontsevich in 2003 and in particular helped inspire Costello) proving a much stronger result, which is the TCFT (or equivalently differential graded / $A_oo$-) version of the classification of open-closed 2d [[TQFT]]s. These papers were directly motivated by homological mirror symmetry and [[topological string theory|topological]] [[string theory]], and have greatly influenced work in areas such as [[string topology]] which you mention and the [[cobordism hypothesis]] ([[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories|Hopkins-Lurie]] started from Costello's paper and abstracted the argument, before the general argument in n-dimensions came around).

>[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: not sure which $n$-categorical aspect of these two subjects we might want to discuss. As soon as I know, I would try to move it into the above pattern, but for the moment I am not sure.
