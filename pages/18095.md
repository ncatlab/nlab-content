
## Definition

In a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$, the _unit ball_ around some point $x \in X$ is the [[set]] of points of [[distance]] at most 1 from $x$: $\{y \in X \vert d(x,y) \leq 1\}$.

One special case that is often used is the unit ball in a metrized [[topological vector space]], whereby the point $x$ in the above definition is taken to be the zero vector. More specifically, the unit ball of a [[Banach space]] is of interest, as there is an [[adjunction]] between the category of Banach spaces and contractions, and the category of sets, where the right adjoint functor $Ban \to Set$ takes the underlying set of the unit ball.

Note that the unit ball around the zero vector makes sense in any [[norm#on_a_vector_space|normed vector space]], or even if the vector space is only equipped with a [[seminorm]].
