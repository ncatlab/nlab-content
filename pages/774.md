In a category $C$ a diagram of morphisms of $C$ 

$$U \rightrightarrows ^a_b V \rightarrow ^c X $$

 is called a [[coequaliser]] diagram if 

1. $ca=cb$; and 

1. $c$ is universal for this property: i.e. if $f: V \to Y$ is a morphism of $C$ such that $fa=fb$, then there is a unique morphism $f': X \to Y$ such that $f'c=f$. 


This concept is a special case of that of [[colimit]].
