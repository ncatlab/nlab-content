## Definition

A **finite limit** is a [[limit]] over a [[diagram]] that is a [[finite category]].

More generally, in [[higher category theory]], a finite limit is a [[limit]] of a diagram that is a finite [[(n,r)-category]].


## Related concepts

A [[category]] that has all finite limits is called a [[finitely complete category]] or a (finitary) [[essentially algebraic theory]].

A [[functor]] that preserves finite limits is called [[left exact functor]], a _lex_ functor, a _cartesian_ functor, or a _finitely continuous_ functor.   The 2-category of finitely complete categories, left exact functors and natural transformations is called [[Lex]].
