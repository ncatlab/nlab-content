In the [[foundations of mathematics]], one sometimes comes across the phrase ‘ordinary mathematics’.  This seems to mean mathematics that does not use high-powered axioms (such as the [[axiom of replacement]] or [[large cardinals]]), thus excluding [[model theory]] and [[category theory]] (beyond the basics).  One might define it as mathematics that can be formalised in [[ETCS]]; this includes all mathematics through the 19th century and most of 20th-century mathematics as well.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_mathematics) defines it as mathematics that takes place is the [[von Neumann universe]] of rank $\omega + \omega$, which is a model of $ETCS$.
