##Motivation##

Gabber and Ramero have developed a chapter in abstract algebra and [[algebraic geometry]] which should, in the style of Grothendieck's theory of [[schemes]], capture some of the ideas of [Gerd Faltings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Faltings). To this aim they define a notion of [[almost ring]], almost module, and finally, __almost scheme__. The framework is akin to many ideas in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and in particular uses localization theory (compare also the generalized algebraic geometry of [[Nikolai Durov]]).

>The categories of almost modules and almost algebras are introduced as a convenient setting for the development of Faltings' method of almost etale extensions. After some preliminaries of general "almost homological algebra" we construct the almost version of the cotangent complex and we use it to generalise some results of Faltings on the lifting of almost etale morphisms and almost etale algebras over nilpotent extensions. We also study the "almost trace" of an almost flat and almost finitely presented morphism, in particular we show that the almost trace is (almost) perfect if and only if the morphism is almost etale. Finally we study some cases of non-flat descent for almost rings, and establish the invariance of almost etale morphisms under Frobenius.

>We develop almost ring theory, which is a domain of mathematics somewhere halfway between ring theory and category theory (whence the difficulty of finding appropriate MSC-class numbers). We apply this theory to valuation theory and to p-adic analytic geometry. You should really have a look at the introductions (each chapter has one).
