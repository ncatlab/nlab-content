## Idea

A _$Q$-category_ is nothing but a [[coreflective subcategory]] and a _$Q^\circ$-category_ is nothing but a [[reflective subcategory]]. Since both of these encode reflective [[localization]]s, following [Rosenberg](#Rosenberg) the "Q" is for _quotient_ and is to indicate that in this context one is interested in notions similar to, but different from, the standard notion of [[sheaves]]:

for $\mathbb{C} := (C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\hookrightarrow}} \bar C)$ a $Q^\circ$-category there is canonically induced a quadruple of [[adjoint functor]]s between the corresponding [[presheaf categories]]

$$
  PSh(\bar A)
   \stackrel{\overset{u_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{}{\stackrel{\overset{u^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{u_*}{\to}}{\underset{u^!}{\leftarrow}}}}}
  PSh(A) 
$$

and a presheaf $F \in PSh(A)$ is called an _$\mathbb{A}$-sheaf_ if the canonical morphism

$$
  u^* F \to u^! F
$$

is an [[isomorphism]] in $PSh(\bar A)$. More generally, there are generalizations of this condition where presheaves of sets can be replaced with presheaves with values in other categories, notably in [[abelian categories]].

In a central motivating class of examples $\bar C$ is a category of [[sieve]]s on objects in a [[small category]] $C$ that are regarded as being [[covering]] but which do not necessarily satisfy the axioms of a [[Grothendieck topology]] and not even of a [[coverage]].


## Motivation

The [[Yoneda embedding]] is continuous but not cocontinuous functor. Hence the Grothendieck topologies are used to define smaller image than the category of presheaves such that for that embedding some covering cones will stay covering cones. In one case the cones correspond to the Grothendieck topology but more general families of diagrams may be involved. The important properties of categories of diagrams for doing the sheaf theory can be expressed in terms of certain adjoint pairs of functors. As one application this generalization of sheaf theory can also rephrase categorically properties like formal smoothness and formal etaleness of functors, and as another puts the sheafification in a framework for which another special case is a construction of the Gabriel-type noncommutative localization. 

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #QCategory}
###### Definition

An __almost quotient category__, or a __$Q$-category__ is 

* a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s

  $$
    \mathbb{A} : (u^* \dashv u_*) :  \bar A \stackrel{\overset{u^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{u_*}{\to}} A
    \,,
  $$

  with $Q$ the [[left adjoint]];

* such that $Q$ is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] 

In other words, $A$ is equipped with an equivalence with a [[coreflective subcategory]] of $\bar{A}$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_note #QTerminology}
###### Note

* In motivating classes of examples $\bar A$ and $A$ are [[topos]]es and $\mathbb{A}$ is a [[geometric morphism]] between them. Therefore one generally speaks of $u_*$ as the **[[direct image]]** and of $u^*$ as the **[[inverse image]]** of the Q-category.

* The definition \ref{QCategory} is nothing but the definition of a [[coreflective subcategory]]. However the term _$Q$-category_ is used when the pair is used in a specific meaning useful to constructions in (generalized) sheaf theory (similarly like presheaf of objects in $D$ and contravariant functor to $D$ are synonyms, but a different word refers to a different context and intuition).

+-- {: .num_defn #QopCategory}
###### Definition

A $Q^\circ$-category is a pair of functors $Q: A\leftrightarrow\bar{A}: I$,
where $Q$ is fully faithful and right adjoint to $I$. In other words, $A$ is equipped with an equivalence with a [[reflective subcategory]] of $\bar{A}$.

## Examples

### Presheaves on a $Q$-category

The [[category of presheaves]] over any $Q$-category canonically inherits itself the structure of a Q-category. 

+-- {: .num_prop #PresheafQCategories}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathbb{A} = \bar A \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} A$ be a $Q$-category. 
Let $C$ be any category.

Then forming [[copresheaves]] with values in $C$ yields a Q-category of the form

$$
  [\mathbb{A},C] :
   [\bar A, C]
     \stackrel{\overset{C^R = (-)\circ R}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{C^L = (-)\circ L}{\to}}
   [A,C]
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The $(C^R \dashv C^L)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]] is the dual $C^\eta$  of the original counit $\eta$

$$
  C^{\eta} : Id_{C^A} \to C^L \circ C^R = C^{L R}
$$ 

and the counit is the dual of the original unit

$$
  C^\epsilon : C^R\circ C^L = C^{R L}\to Id_{C^{\bar{A}}}
  \,.
$$ 

Since the [[left adjoint]] being a [[full and faithful functor]] is equivalent to the unit of the [[adjunction]] being an [[isomorphism]], it follows from $L$ being full and faithful that $C^R$ is full and faithful.

=--

This appears as ([Kontsevich-Rosenberg, 2.7](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).

+-- {: .num_note #ExtraAdjointsForPresheafQCategories}
###### Note

Assume in the context of prop. \ref{PresheafQCategories} that

* $A$ and $\bar A$ are [[small categories]];

* $C$ has all small [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s (for instance $C$ = [[Set]]).

Then there is a quadruple of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  (u_! \dashv u^* \dashv u_* \dashv u^* \dashv u_*) : 
  [\bar A, C]
    \stackrel{\overset{u_! = Lan R}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{u^* = C^R}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{u_* = C^L}{\to}}{\underset{u^! = Ran L}{\leftarrow}}}}
  [A,C]
  \,,
$$

where $Lan R$ denotes the left [[Kan extension]] along $R$ and $Ran L$ the right Kan extension along $L$.

### Domain and codomain fibration 

+-- {: .num_defn #DomainAndCodomainFibration}
###### Proposition

For $A$ any [[category]], write $\bar A := A^I$ for its [[arrow category]].
This comes equipped with the [[codomain fibration]] $cod : \bar A \to A$ and the [[domain cofibration]] $dom : \bar A \to A$. Both have a joint [[section]] $\epsilon : A \to \bar A$ by a [[full and faithful functor]] that assigns identity morphisms. These form a triple of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  (codom \dashv \epsilon \dashv dom) :
  A^I
    \stackrel{\overset{codom}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\epsilon}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{dom}{\to}}}
  A
  \,.
$$


Taking this apart, we have that

$$
  A^{dom} : A^I \stackrel{\overset{\epsilon}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{dom}{\to}}
  A
$$

is a $Q$-category and 

$$
  A^{dom} : A^I
    \stackrel{\overset{cod}{\to}}{\underset{\epsilon}{\leftarrow}}
  A
$$

is a $Q^o$-category.

=--

This appears as ([Kontsevich-Rosenberg, 2.5](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).

Several classes of examples of Q-categories of interest arise as sub-Q-categories of those of this form. For instance the Q-categories of infinitesimal thickenings [below](#InfinitesimalThickening).

+-- {: .num_note #PresheavesOnCodomainFibration}
###### Note

Passing to copresheaf Q-categories as in prop. \ref{PresheafQCategories}
we have the Q-category

$$
  [A^I,Set]
   \stackrel{\overset{u^* = (-)\circ dom}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{u_* = (-)\circ \epsilon}{\to}}{\overset{u^! = (-)\circ codom}{\leftarrow}}}
  [A,Set]
$$

where the extra [[right adjoint]] is given by precomposition with the domain evaluation.



=--


### Q-category of cones

Let $C$ be a category and $LC$ be the category whose objects are [[cones]] $\alpha: x\to d$ over (small) diagrams $d: D\to C$ where $D$ are variable small categories; and the morphisms from $x\stackrel{\alpha}\to d$ to $x'\stackrel{\alpha'}\to d'$ are triples of the form $(f,\rho,\bar{f})$ where $f:x\to x'$ is a morphism in $C$, $\rho : D\to D'$ is a diagram (= functor), and $\bar{f}:d\circ\rho\to d'$ is a morphism of diagrams (= natural transformation) such that 
$$\array{
x & \stackrel{f}\to & x'\\
\alpha\star\rho\downarrow && \downarrow\alpha'\\
d\circ \rho &\stackrel{\bar{f}}\to & d'
}$$
commutes and $\alpha\star \rho$ denotes the horizontal (= Godement) composition of natural transformations. 

Then one defines composition of morphisms by the formula
$$
(f_1, \rho_1,\bar{f_1})\circ(f_2, \rho_2,\bar{f_2})
\stackrel{def}{=}(f_1\circ f_2, \bar{f_1}\rho_2\circ\rho_1\f_2, \bar{f_1}\circ\bar{f_2}).
$$

There is a fully faithful functor $Q_C:C\to LC$ that to any $x\in C$ assigns the trivial cone $id_x :x\to x$ and to any morphism the corresponding morphism of trivial cones. Its right adjoint is the morphism $I_C:LC\to C$ defined by sending the cone $\alpha: x\to d$ over a diagram $d:D\to C$ its vertex $x$ and to a cone morphism $(f,\rho,\bar{f})$, the morphism of vertices $f$. Then $I_C\circ Q_C = Id_C$. The identity transformation can be thus taken as the unit of the adjunction. The counit of the adjunction $\epsilon: Q_C\circ I_C \to Id_{LC}$ is constructed as follows: to a cone $\alpha:x\to d$ assign the morphism $(1_x, const, \alpha)$ where $const: D\to C$ is the constant diagram which is the unique diagram from $D = dom(d)$ to the final category $1=\{\star\}$. One can check that these data indeed define an adjoint pair $Q_C\dashv I_C$ of functors. 
$Q_C: C\leftrightarrow I_C: LC$ is therefore a Q-category, and it is called the __Q-category of cones__. 

If $\mathcal{L}\subset Cat$ is a family of small categories, then one considers the full subcategory $L_{\mathcal{L}}C$ of cones whose domains are in $\mathcal{L}$; the rest of the construction restricts to obtain a Q-category $Q^{\mathcal{L}}_C : C\leftrightarrow L_{\mathcal{L}}C : I_C^{\mathcal{L}}$. 

The most classical case is when $\mathcal{L}$ is the (say skeletal) category $Dis$ of small discrete categories (=just identity morphisms), one obtains then the Q-category $Q^{Dis}_C: C\leftrightarrow L_{Dis}C$. 
A __semicosite__ (or semicositus pl. semicositi) is a Q-category of the form $C\leftrightarrow \bar{C}$ where $\bar{C}$ is a full subcategory of $L_{Dis}C$ and the adjoint pair is obtained by the restriction. A semicosite is a __precosite__ (=Grothendieck precotopology) if 

(i) $id_x\in Ob(\bar{C})$ whenever $x\in Ob(C)$.

(ii) $\{x\stackrel{\phi_i}\to x_i\}_{i\in I}\in Ob(\bar{C})$ and $\{x_i\stackrel{\phi_{ij}}\to x_{ij}\}_{j\in J_i}\in Ob(\bar{C})$ then $\{x\stackrel{\phi_{ij}\circ\phi_i}\to x_{ij}\}\in Ob(\bar{A})$

(iii) $\{x\to x_i\}_{i\in I}\in Ob(\bar{C})$ and $g\in C(x,y)$, then the family of pushouts $\{y\mapsto x_i\coprod_x y\}_{i\in I}$ exists and belongs to $Ob(\bar{C})$.

An example of a cosite is a cosite of closed sets of a topological space.

The $Q$-category of [[sieves]].

The $Q$-subcategory of the $Q$-category of (all) sieves corresponding to the subcategory of sieves corresponding to the Grothendieck topology...

(needs explanation)


### Infinitesimal thickenings
 {#InfinitesimalThickening}

Generally, [[infinitesimal object|infintiesimal thickenings]] are characterized by [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective embeddings]]:

A characteristic property of an [[infinitesimally thickened point]] $D$ is that for $X$ any object without infinitesimal thickening, there are in general nontrivial morphisms $D \to X$, but there is only a unique morphism $X \to D$, reflecting the fact that $D$ has only a single global point. Thus if by $i : C \to \bar C$ we denote the inclusion of objects $X$ without infinitesimal thickening into the collection of possibly infinitesimally thickened objects, and by $p : \bar C \to C$ the projection that contracts away the infinitesimal extension, we have indeed an [[adjunction]]

$$
  \bar C(i(X), D) \simeq C(X, p(D)) \simeq C(X,*) \simeq *
  \,.
$$

This general concept is described at <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#InfinitesimalNeighBourhoodSite">infinitesimal neighbourhood site</a>. See also the discussion below at [Relation to cohesive toposes](#RelationToCohesiveToposes).

The following is one realization of this general concept. 

+-- {: .num_prop #InfinitesimalThickening}
###### Proposition

Let $k$ be a [[field]] and $A := CAlg_k$ be the category of commutative [[associative algebra]]s over $k$. 

Let $\bar A \subset A^I$ be the [[full subcategory]] of the [[codomain fibration]] Q-category from prop. \ref{DomainAndCodomainFibration} on those morphisms of commutative algebras which are [[epimorphism]]s and whose [[kernel]] is nilpotent. Then

$$
  CAlg_k^{inf} : \bar A \stackrel{\overset{\epsilon}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{dom}{\to}} A
$$

is a Q-category.

The analogous statement is true with $A = Alg_k$ the category of all [[associative algebra]]s, not necessarily commutative.

## $\mathbb{A}$-Sheaves
  {#ASheaves}

We discuss the notion of a _$\mathbb{A}$-sheaves_ on a Q-category $\mathbb{A}$.


+-- {: .num_defn #BareSheafCondition}
###### Definition

Let $\mathbb{A} = (\bar A \stackrel{\overset{u^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{u_*}{\to}}A)$ be a [Q-category](#QCategory). An object $x \in A$ is called an **$\mathbb{A}$-sheaf** if for all $y \in \bar A$ the canonical morphism

$$
  \bar A(y, u^*(x)) \to A(u_*(y), x)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]] (in [[Set]], hence a [[bijection]]).

This morphism is given by

$$
  g \mapsto \eta_x^{-1} \circ u_*(g)
$$

where $\eta_x : u_* u^*(x) \to x$ is the $x$-component of the $(u^* \dashv u_*)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]] (which is an [[isomorphism]] because $u^*$ is a [[full and faithful functor]]).


=--

This appears as ([Kontsevich-Rosenberg, 3.1.1](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).



+-- {: .num_prop #SheafConditionByExtraRightAdjoint}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathbb{A}$ be a Q-category with an extra [[right adjoint]] $u^! : A \to \bar A$

$$
  \mathbb{A}
  : 
  \bar A
    \stackrel{\overset{u^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{u_*}{\to}}{\underset{u^!}{\leftarrow}}}
  A
  \,.
$$

Then an object $x \in A$ is an $\mathbb{A}$-sheaf in the sense of def. \ref{BareSheafCondition} precisely if the canonical morphism

$$
  (u^*(x) \to u^!(x))
  :=
  u^*(X) 
    \stackrel{}{\to}
  u^! u_* u^* (x)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  u^! (x)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]] in $\bar A$. It is a monopresheaf precisely if this is a [[monomorphism]].

=--

This appears as ([Kontsevich-Rosenberg, 3.1.3](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).

For more details on the canonical morphism appearing here see the section <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+topos#AdjointQuadruples">Adjoint quadruples</a> at [[cohesive topos]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using the $(u_* \dashv u^!)$-[[adjunction]]-[[isomorphism]] we have that the canonical morphism from def. \ref{BareSheafCondition} is isomorphic to

$$
  \phi : \bar A(y, u^* x) \to A(u_* y, x) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   \bar A(y, u^! y)
  \,,
$$

for all $y \in \bar A$, where the second map sends every morphism to its [[adjunct]]. Using the definition of the first morphism from def. \ref{BareSheafCondition} and the expression of [[adjunct]]s (as discussed there) by composition with (co)-units, we find that the composite map here sends any morphism

$$
  g : y \to u^* x
$$

to the composite

$$
  \array{
     y 
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     u^! u_* y &\stackrel{u^! u_* g}{\to}& u^! u_* u^* x
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && u^! x
  }
  \,.
$$

Using that [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction units]] are [[natural transformation]]s, we can complete this to a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& u^* x
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     u^! u_* y &\stackrel{u^! u_* g}{\to}& u^! u_* u^* x
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && u^! x
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that $\phi$ acts on any $g$ by postcomposition with the canonical morphism $u^* x \to u^! x$. By the [[Yoneda lemma]] it follows that $\phi$ is an [[isomorphism]] for all $y$ precisely if $u^* x \to u^!$ is an isomorphism.

+-- {: .num_def #MonoAndEpiPresheaves}

Let $\mathbb{A} = (u^* \dashv u_* \dashv u^!): \bar A \to A$ be a  Q-category with an extra right adjoint as in prop. \ref{SheafConditionByExtraRightAdjoint}.

We say

* an object $x \in A$ is **$\mathbb{A}$-monopresheaf** if $u^* x \to u^! x$ is a [[monomorphism]] in $\bar A$.

## Relation to other concepts


### Relation to cohesive toposes
  {#RelationToCohesiveToposes}

If a Q-category $\mathbb{A}$ has the extra [[right adjoint]] of prop. \ref{SheafConditionByExtraRightAdjoint} and in addition an extra left adjoint to a total of a quadruple of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  \mathbb{A} : 
   \bar A
     \stackrel{\overset{u_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{u^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{u_*}{\rightarrow}}{\underset{u^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
   A
$$

then essential axioms characterizing a [[cohesive topos]] are satisfied, in particular if for instance $\bar A$ and $A$ are [[presheaf topos]]es as in \ref{PresheafQCategories} (this is considered around [Kontsevich-Rosenberg, 3.5.1](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).

Notably in this case the canonical [[natural transformation]]

$$
  u^* \to u^!

from prop. \ref{SheafConditionByExtraRightAdjoint} is the one appears in the axioms of a [[cohesive topos]]: if this transformation is a [[monomorphism]] in a cohesive topos -- hence if in the language of Q-categories all objects are monopresheaves -- one says that _discrete objects are concrete_ in the cohesive topos.

Moreover, due to the extra left adjoint $u_!$ there is a canonical dual morphism

$$
  u_* \to u_!
  \,.
$$ 

In ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)) is the suggestion that it is interesting to consider the full subcategory of $\bar A$ on which $u_* \to u_!$ is an isomorphism. This is dual to the statement of the above section on [A-Sheaves](#ASheaves) which asserts that it is interesting to consider the full subcategory of $A$ on which $u^* \to u^!$ is an isomorphism.

More concretely, the axioms of <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#InfinitesimalCohesion">Infinitesimal cohesion</a> are an abstraction of the situation of prop. \ref{InfinitesimalThickening}. In every cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos equipped with an _infinitesimal neighbourhood_ there is an analog of the characterization of formal smoothness from prop. \ref{FormalSmoothnessByASheaves}. See the section <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#InfinitesimalPaths">Infinitesimal paths and de Rham spaces</a>.

The term _$Q$-category_ originally was short for _almost quotient category_ , presumably because of its role in the theory of [[Gabriel localization]]. The sheaf formalism in terms of $Q$-categories has been introduced in the mimeographed notes
