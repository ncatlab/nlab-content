## Idea

The [[waves]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] in [[electromagnetism]] are called _light_ (sometimes the term is limited to the [[frequency]] range of _visible light_ and a bit below ([[infrared]]) and above ([[ultraviolet]]) that): light is appearing as _[[electromagnetic radiation]]_. 

## Properties

The [[quanta]] of light are [[photons]]. The [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]] plays a special role in the laws of physics, see at _[[special relativity]]_.
