## Definitions and terminology

A **split epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $e\colon A \to B$ in $C$ such that there exists a morphism $s\colon B \to A$ such that the [[composite]] $e \circ s$ equals the [[identity morphism]] $1_B$.  Then the morphism $s$, which satisfies the [[duality|dual]] condition, is a __[[split monomorphism]]__.

We say that:
* $s$ is a __[[section]]__ of $e$,
* $e$ is a __[[retraction]]__ of $s$,
* $B$ is a __[[retract]]__ of $A$,
* the pair $(e,s)$ is a __[[split idempotent|splitting]]__ of the [[idempotent]] $s \circ e\colon A \to A$.  

A split epimorphism in $C$ can be equivalently defined as a morphism $e\colon A \to B$ such that for every [[object]] $X\colon C$, the [[function]] $C(X,e)$ is a [[surjection]] in $\mathbf{Set}$; the preimage of $1_B$ under $C(B,e)$ yields a section $s$.

Alternatively, it is also possible to define a split epimorphism as an __absolute epimorphism__: a morphism such that for every [[functor]] $F$ out of $C$, $F(e)$ is an [[epimorphism]].  From the definition as a morphism having a section, it is obvious that any split epimorphism is absolute; conversely, that the image of $e$ under the representable functor $C(B,1)$ is an epimorphism reduces to the characterization above.


## Properties

* Any split epimorphism is automatically a [[regular epimorphism]] (it is the [[coequalizer]] of $s\circ e$ and $1_A$), and therefore also a [[strong epimorphism]], an [[extremal epimorphism]], and (of course) an [[epimorphism]].

* The [[axiom of choice]] [[internal logic|internal]] to a category $C$ can be phrased as "all epimorphisms are split."  In [[Set]] this is equivalent to the usual axiom of choice; in many other categories it may be true without assuming the axiom of choice (in $Set$), or it may be false regardless of the axiom of choice.


## Applications

The notion of split epimorphism arises often as a condition on fibrations in [[categories of chain complexes]]. See there for details.


## Examples

* In [[Vect]], every epimorphism is split. For $\phi\colon V \to W$ a surjective linear map, we can find an isomorphism $V \simeq ker(\phi) \oplus V'$. Then $\phi|_{V'}$ is an isomorphism, and its inverse $W \to V' \hookrightarrow ker(\phi) \oplus V'$ is a section of $\phi$.
