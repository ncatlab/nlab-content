## Idea

In the context of [[string theory]], the [[background gauge field]] over a [[D-brane]] is a unitary [[principal bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]], or rather, by the [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] mechanism, a [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundle]], whose twist is the restriction of the ambient [[B-field]] to the D-brane.

The first hint for the existence of such [[background gauge fields]] for the [[open string]] 2d-[[sigma-model]] comes from the fact that the open string's endpoint can naturally be taken to carry labels $i \in \{1, \cdots n\}$. Further analysis then shows that the lowest excitations of these $(i,j)$-strings behave as the quanta of a $U(n)$-[[gauge field]], the $(i,j)$-excitation being the given [[matrix]] element of a $U(n)$-valued connection 1-form $A$.

This original argument goes back work by Chan and Paton. Accordingly one speaks of _Chan-Paton factors_ and _Chan-Paton bundles_ .
