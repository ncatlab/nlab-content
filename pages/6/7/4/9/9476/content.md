P&#243;lya enumeration theorem is a particular theorem in [[enumerative combinatorics]]; it serves as a basis of methods often called P&#243;lya's enumeration (counting) theory. It is especially used in counting of graphs, including often in applications like chemistry.

The P&#243;lya "theory" can be redone in terms of Joyal [[species]]. 

The theory can also be rederived from state sum
identities in certain positive [[TQFT]]:
