Localization of a category is an ambiguous term that can refer to one of the two following notions:

* [[category of fractions]].  This is traditional terminology, used in the books by Gabriel–Zisman and Borceux.

* [[reflective localization]].  This meaning is especially prevalent in the literature on [[quasicategories]], following Lurie's [[Higher Topos Theory]].  However, some authors use “localization” to mean the [[quasicategory of fractions]] instead.
