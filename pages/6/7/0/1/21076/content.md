## Idea

The evolution of the early [[observable universe]] must have been crucially affected by the properties (e.g. [[equation of state]]) of the primordial [[quark-gluon plasma]], and then, as the [[temperature]] decreased, by its [[confinement]] [[phase transition]] during [[nucleosynthesis]] to a [[hadron]] [[gas]]. These effects are controlled by [[quantum chromodynamics]] ([[QCD]]) and specifically in its [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[confinement|confined]] [[state of matter|phase]]. The study of the properties of [[QCD]] relevant for [[cosmology]] this way is called _QCD cosmology_.
