## Statement

The [[topological space]] underlying a [[scheme]] is a [[sober topological space]].

Recall that the points of the underlying topological space of an [[affine scheme]] are [[prime ideals]] of the corresponding [[ring]]. If one takes only the subspace with points the [[maximal ideals]], as in algebraic geometry before the introduction of schemes, then one does not get a sober space.

If the ring is a Jacobson ring (any prime ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals), then the [[soberification]] of this subspace is the prime spectrum.
