 {#PolyakovGaugeStringDualityReferences}

Key ideas underlying what is now known as the *[[AdS-CFT correspondence|holographic]] [[duality in string theory|duality in]] [[string theory]]* and specifically *[[AdS-QCD correspondence|holographic QCD]]* (see notably also at *[[holographic light front QCD]]*) were preconceived by [[Alexander Polyakov]] (cf. historical remarks in [Polyakov (2008)](#Polyakov08)) under the name *[[gauge/string duality]]*, in efforts to understand [[confinement|confined]] [[QCD]] (the [[mass gap problem]]) by regarding [[color charge|color]]-[[flux tubes]] ([[Wilson lines]]) between [[quarks]] as dynamical [[strings]]:

Early suggestion that [[confinement|confined]] [[QCD]] is described by regarding the [[color charge|color]]-[[flux tubes]] as [[string]]-like dynamical degrees of freedoms:

  > "The gauge-invariant configuration space consists of a collection of strings with quarks at their ends. The strings are lines of non-Abelian electric flux. In the strong coupling limit the dynamics is best described in terms of these strings. Quark confinement is a result of the inability to break a string without producing a pair. $[$...$]$"

  > "This picture of the strongly coupled Yang-Mills theory in terms of a collection of stringlike flux lines is the central result of our analysis. It should be compared with the phenomenological use of stringlike degrees of freedom which has been widely used in describing hadrons."

  > "The basic idea is that gauge fields can be considered as chiral fields, defined on the space of all possible contours (the [[free loop space|loop space]]). The origin of the idea lies in the expectation that, in the confining phase of a gauge theory, [[closed strings]] should play the role of elementary excitations."

  > "So the [[world sheet]] of [[string]] should be interpreted as the color magnetic dipole sheet. The string itself should be interpreted as the electric [[flux tube]] in the [[monopole]] plasma."

> $[$[old personal page](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/alexander-polyakov)$]$: "My main interests this year $[$1993?$]$ were directed towards [[string theory]] of [[quark]] [[confinement]]. The problem is to find the string Lagrangian for the Faraday's "[[flux tube|lines of force]]",which would reproduce perturbative corrections from the [[Yang-Mills theory]] to the Coulomb law at small distances and would give permanent [[confinement]] of quarks at large distances."


Early suggestion, due to the [[Liouville theory|Liouville field]] seen in the [[quantization]] of the [[bosonic string]] via the [[Polyakov action]],

that such [[flux tubes]] regarded as [[confinement|confining]] [[strings]] are to be thought of a probing higher dimensional spacetime, exhibiting a [[holographic principle]] in which actual spacetime appears as a [[intersecting brane model|brane]]:

  > "We add new arguments that the Yang-Mills theories must be described by the non-critical strings in the five dimensional curved space. The physical meaning of the fifth dimension is that of the [[renormalization]] scale represented by the [[Liouville field]]."

eventually culminating in the formulation of the dictionary for the [[AdS-CFT correspondence]]:

> "Relations between gauge fields and strings present an old, fascinating and unanswered question. The full answer to this question is of great importance for theoretical physics. It will provide us with a theory of quark confinement by explaining the dynamics of color-electric fluxes."

and the suggestion of finding the [[AdS-QCD correspondence|string-QCD correspondence]]:

* {#Polyakov02} [[Alexander Polyakov]], _Gauge Fields and Space-Time_, Int. J. Mod. Phys. A **17** S1 (2002) 119-136 $[$[arXiv:hep-th/0110196](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110196), [doi:10.1142/S0217751X02013071](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X02013071)$]$

> "in the strong coupling limit of a [[lattice gauge theory]] the elementary excitations are represented by [[closed strings]] formed by the color-electric fluxes. In the presence of quarks these strings open up and end on the quarks, thus guaranteeing quark confinement. Moreover, in the $SU(N)$ gauge theory the strings interaction is weak at large $N$. This fact makes it reasonable to expect that also in the physically interesting continuous limit (not accessible by the strong coupling approximation) the best description of the theory should involve the [[flux tubes|flux lines]] (strings) and not fields, thus returning us from Maxwell to Faraday. In other words it is natural to expect an exact duality between gauge fields and strings. The challenge is to build a precise theory on the string side of this duality."

> "Already in 1974, in his [famous large $N$ paper](large+N+limit#tHooft74), 't Hooft already tried to find the string-gauge connections. His idea was that the lines of Feynman’s diagrams become dense in a certain sense and could be described as a 2d surface. This is, however, very different from the picture of strings as [[flux tube|flux lines]]. Interestingly, even now people often don’t distinguish between these approaches. In fact, for the usual amplitudes Feynman’s diagrams don’t become dense and the flux lines picture is an appropriate one. However there are cases in which t’Hooft’s mechanism is really working."

  > "By the end of ’77 it was clear to me that I needed a new strategy $[$for understanding [[confinement]]$]$ and I became convinced that the way to go was the [[gauge/string duality]]. $[$...$]$"

  > "Classically the string is infinitely thin and has only transverse oscillations. But when I quantized it there was a surprise -- an extra, longitudinal mode, which appears due to the quantum "thickening" of the string. This new field is called the [[Liouville field|Liouville mode]]. $[$...$]$"

  > "I kept thinking about [[gauge/string duality|gauge/strings dualities]]. Soon after the [[Liouville field|Liouville mode]] was discovered it became clear to many people including myself that its natural interpretation is that random surfaces in 4d are described by the strings flying in 5d with the Liouville field playing the role of the fifth dimension. The precise meaning of this statement is that the wave function of the general string state depends on the four center of mass coordinates and also on the fifth, the Liouville one. In the case of minimal models this extra dimension is related to the matrix eigenvalues and the resulting space is flat."

  > "Since this 5d space must contain the flat 4d subspace in which the gauge theory resides, the natural ansatz for the metric is just the Friedman universe with a certain warp factor. This factor must be determined from the conditions of conformal symmetry on the world sheet. Its dependence on the Liouville mode must be related to the renormalization group flow. As a result we arrive at a fascinating picture -- our 4d world is a projection of a more fundamental 5d string theory. $[$...$]$"

  > "At this point I was certain that I have found the right language for the [[gauge/string duality]]. I attended various conferences, telling people that it is possible to describe gauge theories by solving Einstein-like equations (coming from the conformal symmetry on the world sheet) in five dimensions. The impact of my talks was close to zero. That was not unusual and didn’t bother me much. What really caused me to delay the publication ([Polyakov 1998](#Polyakov98)) for a couple of years was my inability to derive the asymptotic freedom from my equations. At this point I should have noticed the paper of [Klebanov 1997](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9702076) in which he related [[D3 branes]] described by the supersymmetric Yang Mills theory to the same object described by supergravity. Unfortunately I wrongly thought that the paper is related to matrix theory and I was skeptical about this subject. As a result I have missed this paper which would provide me with a nice special case of my program. This special case was presented little later in full generality by Juan Maldacena ([Maldacena 1997](AdS-CFT+correspondence#Maldacena97a)) and his work opened the flood gates."
