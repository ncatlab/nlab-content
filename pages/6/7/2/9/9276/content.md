## Idea

Darboux's theorem states that a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ equipped with a [[differential 1-form]] $\theta$ which is sufficiently non-degenerate admits local [[coordinate charts]] $\phi_i \colon\mathbb{R}^{2n} \to X$ on which $\theta$ takes the canonical form $\phi_i^\ast \theta = \sum_{k} x^{2k} \mathbf{d} x^{2k+1}$.

In particular 

* for $(X, \omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]] there are local charts in which the [[symplectic form]] $\omega$ takes the form $\phi_i^\ast \omega = \sum_{k} \mathbf{d} x^{2k} \wedge \mathbf{d} x^{2k+1}$;

* similarly, for [[contact manifolds]] there are adapated local charts.

(e.g. [Arnold 78, p. 362](#Arnold78))

For the case of symplectic manifolds the Darboux theorem may also be read as saying that a [[G-structure]] for $G = Sp(2n)$ the [[symplectic group]] (hence an [[almost symplectic structure]]) is an [[integrable G-structure]] already when it is first-order integrable, i.e. [[torsion of a G-structure|torsion]]-free, i.e. symplectic.
