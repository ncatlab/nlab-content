Given a ring (or $k$-algebra) $A$, a left $A$-module is __flat__ if tensoring with $A$ as a functor from left $A$-modules to left $A$-modules is exact functor (sends short exact sequences to short exact sequences). 

In the case of an abelian category notion of exact and flat functors coincide. The ring and/or the module above may be taken nonunital.
