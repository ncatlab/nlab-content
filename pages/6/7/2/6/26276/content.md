## Idea

Given a [[group]] $G$, a *symplectic representation* of $G$ is a [[representation]] of $G$ on a [[symplectic vector space]], that is a $F$-vector space (where $F$ is a [[field]]) with a [[symplectic form]] 
(a nondegenerate skew-symmetric [[bilinear form]]) $\omega$, preserving that form: $\omega(g.x,g.y) = \omega(x,y)$ for all $x,y\in G$.
