Given a group $G$, a symplectic representation of $G$ is a [[representation]] of $G$ on a [[symplectic vector space]], that is a $F$-vector space (where $F$ is a field) with a symplectic (=nondegenerate antisymmetric) form $\omega$, preserving that form: $\omega(g.x,g.y) = \omega(x,y)$ for all $x,y\in G$.
