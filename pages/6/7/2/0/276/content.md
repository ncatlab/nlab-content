#Idea#

A _crossed complex_ (of groupoids) is a nonabelian and [[horizontal categorification|many object]] generalization of a chain complex of abelian groups.

Crossed complexes were conceived by Whitehead in the 1950s and then discussed in great detail in a series of articles by Ronnie Brown and collaborators in the context of [[nonabelian algebraic topology]].

Crossed complexes are an equivalent way to encode the information contained in [[strict omega-groupoid]]s: the groups appearing in the crossed complex in degree $n \geq 2$ are the source-fibers of the collection of $n$-morphisms of the $\omega$-groupoid.

#Remarks#

* In low degrees crossed complexes are the following:
  * A crossed complex of length 0 is a [[Set|set]].
  * A crossed complex of length 1 is a [[groupoid]].
  * A crossed complex of length 2 is a [[crossed module]], which is a strict kind of [[2-group]].
