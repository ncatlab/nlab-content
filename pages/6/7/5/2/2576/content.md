# Introduction #

Recall from last time that given $G$ an algebraic group such that the [[formal spectrum]] $Spf A(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$ is the completion $\hat G$, we could define $A_{S^1}({*}) := \mathcal{o}_{G}$ then passing to germs gave a completion map

$$
  A_{S^1}({*}) \to A(\mathbb{C}P^\infty) = 
  A^{Bor}_{S^1}({*}).
$$

The problem we (begin) to address here is how to extend this equivariant cohomology to other spaces besides the point.  This requires derived algebraic geometry.


# Derived group schemes#


Recall that a commutative [[group scheme]] over a scheme $X$ is a functor
$$
G: \mathrm{Sch} /X^{op} \to \mathrm{Ab}
$$
such that composition with the forgetful functor $F: \mathrm{Ab} \to \mathrm{Set}$ is representable.

We would like extend this definition to the world of [[derived scheme]]s.  There are two problems

1. Because of the higher categorical nature of derived schemes Hom sets are spaces.

1. Everything should in the $\infty$-setting, that is defined only up to homotopy.

We will not worry about the second concern and address the first by replacing the category $\mathrm{Ab}$ with $\mathrm{TopAb}$ and $\mathrm{Set}$ with $\mathrm{Top}$.



> The following definition is somewhat restrictive and really should incorporate more of the $\infty$-structure.


**Definition** A commutative [[derived group scheme]] over a [[derived scheme]] $X$ is a topological functor
$$
G: \mathrm{DSch} / X^{op} \to \mathrm{TopAb}
$$ 
such that composition with the forgetful functor $F: \mathrm{TopAb} \to \mathrm{Top}$ is representable (up to weak equivalence) by an object which is [[flat]] over $X$.


**Examples**

1. Let $X$ be a scheme, then we have an associated [[derived scheme]] $\overline{X}$.  The structure sheaf of $\overline{X}$ is obtained by viewing the structure sheaf of $X$ as a presheaf of $E_\infty$-rings and then sheafifying.  We then have an equivalence between commutative [[derived group scheme]]s over $\overline{X}$ and commutative [[group scheme]]s which are flat over $X$.

1. For $X$ a [[derived scheme]] we have a map from commutative [[derived group scheme]]s over $X$ to commutative [[group scheme]]s which are flat over $\pi_0 X$.


#Preorientations#

Throughout $A$ will be an $E_\infty$-ring, $X$ the affine [[derived scheme]] $\mathrm{Spec} A$, $G$ a commutative [[derived group scheme]] over $X$, $A_{S^1}$ the $E_\infty$-ring given by $\Gamma (G)$, and $A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty}$ the $E_\infty$-ring given by

$$
  A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty} = \mathrm{Hom}_{E_\infty} (\mathbb{C}P^\infty , A).
$$

**Definition**(Preliminary) A preorientation of $G$ is a morphism of commutative [[derived group scheme]]s over $X$
$$
\sigma : \mathrm{Spf} A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty} \to G,
$$
where $\mathrm{Spf} A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty}$ is the completion wrt the ideal $\mathrm{ker} (A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty} \to A^{pt} = A)$. A preorientation is an orientation if the induced map
$$
\hat \sigma : \mathrm{Spf} A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty} \to \hat G
$$
is an isomorphism.

Suppose that $G$ is affine, then a map 
$$
\sigma : \mathrm{Spf} A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty} \to G
$$
corresponds to a map $A_{S^1} \to A^{\mathbb{C}P^\infty}$
which is the same as a map
$$
\mathbb{C}P^\infty \to \mathrm{Hom} (X, G) = G(X).
$$
Hence we are led to the following definition.

**Definition** Let $X$ be a [[derived scheme]] and $G$ a commutative [[derived group scheme]] over $X$.  A preorientation of $G$ is a morphism of topological commutative monoids
$$
\mathbb{P} (\mathbb{C} [\alpha]) = \mathbb{C}P^\infty \to G(X).
$$

Notice that $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is nearly freely generated.  Indeed it follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra that as a topological monoid $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is generated by $\mathbb{C}P^1$ subject to the single relation that $\mathrm{pt} = \mathbb{C}P^0 \subset \mathbb{C}P^1$ is the monoidal unit.

**Proposition** A preorientation up to homotopy is a map
$$S^2 \simeq \mathbb{C}P^1 \to G(X) $$
that is an element of $\pi_2 (G(X))$.

Hence, we always have at least one preorientation: the trivial one which corresponds to $0 \in \pi_2 (G(X))$.

#Orientations#

As motivation recall that a map $s: A \to B$ of 1-dim [[formal group]]s is an isomorphism if and only if $s'$ is invertible.  We would like to encode this in our derived language (without defining $s'$).

**Definition** Let $A$ be an $E_\infty$-ring, $G$ a commutative [[derived group scheme]] over $\mathrm{Spec} A$ and $\sigma : S^2 \to G(A)$ a preorientation.  Then $\sigma$ is an orientation if

1. $\pi_0 G \to \mathrm{Spec} \pi_0 A$ is smooth of relative dimension 1, and

1. The map induced by $\beta : \omega \to \pi_2 A$ 
$$
\pi_n A \otimes_{\pi_0 A} \omega \to \pi_{n+2} A$$
is an isomorphism for each $n$.

Note that (2) implies that $A$ is weakly periodic.  Conversely, if $A$ is weakly periodic then (2) is equivalent to $\beta$ being an isomorphism.

Before defining $\beta$ and $\omega$ we extend the above definition to [[derived group scheme]]s over an arbitrary [[derived scheme]].

**Definition** Let $X$ be a [[derived scheme]], $G$ a commutative [[derived group scheme]] over $X$ and $\sigma: S^2 \to G(X)$ a preorientation.  Then $\sigma$ is an orientation if $(G, \sigma) |_U$ is an orientation for all $U \subset X$ affine.

We now define the module $\omega$ and the map $\beta$.  Let $A$ be an $E_\infty$-ring, $G$ a commutative [[derived group scheme]] over $\mathrm{Spec} A$ and let $G_0 = \pi_0 G$ a scheme over $\mathrm{Spec} \pi_0 A$. Let $\Omega$ denote the sheaf of differentials on $G_0 / \pi_0 A$.  Then define
$$\omega := i^* \Omega, \; i: \mathrm{Spec} \pi_0 A \to G $$
is the identity section.

Now let $U \hookrightarrow G$ be an open affine subscheme containing the identity section, so $U = \mathrm{Spec} B$ for some $E_\infty$-ring $B$.  Then $\sigma$ induces a map
$B \to A^{S^2}$ which is the same as a map
$$
\pi_0 B \to A(S^2)= \pi_0 A \oplus \pi_2 A .
$$
It is a fact that the map $\pi_0 B \to \pi_2 A$ is a derivation over $\pi_0 A$ and hence has a classifying map which yields a map
$$\beta : \omega \to \pi_2 A .$$
