##Â Definition

A __localic groupoid__ is a [[internal category|internal]] [[groupoid]] in the category of locales. A special case is of [[localic group]]s.

Localic groupoids are important, among other reasons, because every [[Grothendieck topos]] can be presented as the [[topos]] of equivariant [[sheaves]] on some localic groupoid.  This fact is due to [[Andre Joyal|Joyal]] and Tierney. For more see [[classifying topos of a localic groupoid]].
