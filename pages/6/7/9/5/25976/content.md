## Idea

In [[epistemic modal logic]], the **KK principle** or **KK thesis** states that for any proposition $p$, if one knows that $p$, then one knows that one knows it. While admitted by one of the early workers in the field, [[Jaakko Hintikka]], it is the subject of considerable philosophical debate (see [Hemp](#Hemp)).
