#Motivation and history#

While the homotopy theory is suitable for the study of (locally) good topological spaces, it fails to give useful information for bad spaces, whose classical examples are [[Warszaw circle]], Sierpinski gasket and so on. Even if 
our principal interest is in good spaces, bad spaces arise in their study. For example, in the study of dynamical systems on manifolds, an important issue are the attractors of such systems, which are typically fractal sets. The intuitive idea of shape theory is to define invariants of topological spaces by approximating them with good spaces, either by considerations of embedding into good spaces, or by considering abstract inverse systems of good spaces. 

The shape theory has been first introduced by Polish mathematician [Karol Borsuk](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Borsuk.html) in the 1960s. The modern version of shape theory is developed in terms of inverse systems ([[pro-object]]s) introduced in this setup by S. Marde&#353;i&#263;. For many applications one needs more refined invariants which build up [[strong shape theory]], while sometimes a more crude versions may be useful, for example recent theory of [[coarse shape]].

M. Batanin further elucidated shape theory from categorical and 2-categorical point of view, but his approach is still not much used.

#Abstract shape category#

The shape category associated to a pair $(C,D)$ of a category $C$ and its [[dense subcategory]] $D$ (of good objects) in the second sense, that is for every object $X$ in $C$ there is its $D$-expansion, that is a universal object $\mathbf{X}$ in the category $\mathrm{pro}-D$ of pro-objects in $D$, together with a map $X\to\mathbf{X}$ in $\mathrm{pro}-D$, which is universal (initial) among all such. The shape category has the same objects as $C$ and its morphisms are equivalence classes of maps between the $D$-expansions.
