## Idea

The **Wess-Zumino-Witten model** (or **WZW model** for short, also called  **Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten** model, or short **WZNW** model) is a 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] whose target space is a [[Lie group]].

This may be regarded as the boundary theory of [[Chern-Simons theory]] for Lie group $G$.

The [[vertex operator algebra]]s corresponding to the WZW model are [[current algebra]]s.

## References

A useful account of the WZW model that encompasses both its [[action functional]] and [[path integral]] quantization as well as the [[current algebra]] aspects of the QFT is in

* [[Krzysztof Gawedzki]], _Conformal field theory: a case study_ ([hep-th/9904145](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9904145))

This starts in section 2 as a warmup with describing the 1d QFT of a particle propagating on a group manifold. Thee [[Hilbert space]] of [[state]]s is expressed in terms of the [[Lie theory]] of $G$ and its [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$.

In section 4 the quantization of the 2d WZW model is discussed in analogy to that. In lack of a full formalization of the quantization procedure, the author uses the loop algebra $\mathcal{l} \mathfrak{g}$ --  the [[affine algebra]] -- of $\mathfrak{g}$ as the evident analog that replaces $\mathfrak{g}$ and discusses the Hilbert space of states in terms of that. He also indicates how this may be understood as a space of sections of a [[line bundle]] over the loop group.
