## Idea

In some noncommutative algebras there are elements which can be in terms of a distinguished generators (resembling matrix entries of a generic matrix) written by formulas analogous to the formula for the usual determinant. 

In some cases they have special properties, for example being central (e.g. in the case of [[Yangian]]). 

In the case of [[quantum linear group]]s, as the usual determinant is related to the exterior algebra, the  corresponding quantum determinant is related to a quantum exterior algebra. In some cases, quantum determinants may be written as products of quasideterminants, similarly to the usual determinant.

Historically, quantum determinants first appeared in the works of Leningrad school of quantum integrable systems.
