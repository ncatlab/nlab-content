## Definition

A __compact metrizable space__ is a [[metrizable topological space]] that is also a [[compact space]].

## Terminology

A compact metrizable space is sometimes called a __[[compactum]]__ (plural, *compacta*).  (But be warned that “compactum” is also sometimes used in the literature to refer to a [[compact Hausdorff space]]. In particular, this sense has been adopted in many nLab article pages, as a handy shorthand.)
