A __comonad__ (or cotriple) on a category $A$ is a [[monad]] on its [[dual category]] $A^{op}$. Similarly a comonad in a 2-category $E$ is a [[comonoid]] in the [[monoidal category]] $E(X,X)$ for some object $X$. Every [[additive monad|additive]] comonad on an [[abelian category]] $A$ induces an augmented simplicial endofunctor on $A$, what is the basis of [[comonadic homology]]. [[algebra for a monad|Comodules]] (= coalgebras) over the comonad with underlying endofunctor $M_R\mapsto M_R\otimes_R S$ in $R$-$Mod$ for the  extension of rings $R\hookrightarrow S$ correspond to the [[descent]] data for that extension. [[zoranskoda:gluing categories from localizations|Gluing of categories from localizations]] may also be formalized via comonads.

[[distributive law|Distributive laws]] between a monad and a comonad are so-called _mixed_ distributive laws; a special case has been rediscovered in physics under the name _entwining structures_ (Brzezi&#324;ski, Majid 1997). Their theory is often studied in the connection with the theory of comonads in the bicategory of rings, modules and morphisms of modules, that is [[coring]]s. There is a homomorphism of bicategories from a bicategory of entwinings to a bicategory of corings ([&#352;koda 2008](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0805.4611)), which is an analogue of the 2-functor $comp$ (R. Street, _Formal theory of monads_, JPAA 1972) of strict 2-categories in the case of distributive laws of monads (recall also that a distributive law among monads corresponds to a monad in the 2-category of monads).
