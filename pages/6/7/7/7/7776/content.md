## Idea 

A basic result in the study of [[coherent sheaf|coherent]] and [[quasicoherent sheaves]] (of [[modules]]) over [[affine schemes]] says that for a [[commutative ring]] $R$ the [[quasicoherent modules]] over the [[spectrum of a ring|Zariski spectrum]] $Spec(R)$ are equivalent to $R$-modules &lbrack;[Serre 1955](#Serre55)&rbrack;.

## Statement in the formalism of locally ringed spaces

Recall that given a commutative unital ring $R$, there is an adjunction 

$$
  \widetilde{(-)} 
  \,\dashv\, 
  \Gamma
  \;\colon\; 
  \mathcal{O}(Spec\; R)\text{-}Mod 
    \leftrightarrows
  R\text{-}Mod
  \,,
$$ 

between the [[category of modules]] over its affine spectrum, i.e., the [[local ring]] object $\mathcal{O}(Spec\; R)$ in the category of [[sheaves]] over the [[topological space]] $Spec(R)$, and the category of ordinary [[modules]] over $R$. 

In the [[right adjoint]] direction, for an $\mathcal{O}(Spec\; R)$-module $\mathcal{F}$, we have the [[presheaf]] value $\mathcal{F}(Spec\; R)$, the module of [[global sections]], usually denoted $\Gamma(\mathcal{F})$. 

In the [[left adjoint]] direction, for a (left) $R$-module $M$, we have a sheaf $\tilde{M}$ over $Spec(R)$, whose value $\tilde{M}(D_f)$ at a typical open $D_f$ of $Spec(R)$ is given by the localization $R[f^{-1}]\otimes_R M$, and where the restriction maps are given by canonical maps between these localizations. This gives a sheaf of modules over the sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}(Spec\; R)$. 

The [[unit of an adjunction|unit of this adjunction]], with components $M \to \Gamma(\tilde{M})$, is the canonical isomorphism $M \cong R \otimes_R M$. The counit, with components $\widetilde{\Gamma(\mathcal{F})} \to \mathcal{F}$, is the presheaf map whose value at a typical open $D_f$ is the canonical map 

$$
  R[f^{-1}] 
    \otimes_R 
  \mathcal{F}(Spec\; R) 
    \longrightarrow 
  \mathcal{F}(D_f)
$$ 

induced by the restriction map 

$$
  \mathcal{F}(Spec\; R) 
    \longrightarrow 
  \mathcal{F}(D_f)
$$ 

of $R$-modules (with $R$ acting on the [[codomain]] by [[restriction of scalars]] along the ring map $R \to R[f^{-1}]$), noting that $R[f^{-1}] \otimes_R (-)$ is left adjoint to the functor that restricts scalars along $R \to R[f^{-1}]$. 

The theorem of [Serre (1955)](#Serre55) is that this [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] restricts to an [[adjoint equivalence]] of categories, which we denote as 

$$
  \widetilde{(-)} \dashv \Gamma
  \;\colon\; 
  Qcoh(Spec R) 
    \leftrightarrows
  R\text{-}Mod
$$

between [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent modules]] over $\mathcal{O}_{Spec R}$, and ordinary $R$-modules. In particular, an $\mathcal{O}_{Spec\; R}$-module $\mathcal{F}$ is quasicoherent if and only if the counit map 

$$
  \varepsilon_\mathcal{F} 
    \;\colon\; 
  \widetilde{\Gamma(\mathcal{F})} 
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{F}
$$ 

is an [[isomorphism]]. 

Furthermore, if $R$ is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]], the adjoint equivalence restricts further to an equivalence between [[coherent sheaves|coherent modules]] over $\mathcal{O}_{Spec R}$ and finitely generated modules over $R$. 

## Statement in the formalism of functor of points

In the formalism of [[functor of points]], the equivalence turns into a definition: affine schemes are defined as the [[opposite category]] of the category of [[commutative rings]] (with the functor $Spec$ now being tautologically defined as the identity functor), and the category of quasicoherent modules over $Spec R$ is now defined as the category of $R$-modules.  This assignment defines a [[stack]] of categories over the site of affine schemes with the [[Zariski topology]].

The functor of points approach carries over to quasicoherent modules over non-affine schemes: given such a scheme $X$, a quasicoherent module over $X$ is a morphism of [[stacks]] from $X$ to the stack of quasicoherent modules defined above.  In concrete terms, this boils down to picking an open cover of $X$ and defining a quasicoherent module using [[cocycle data]].
