Physical bodies interact. The effects of binary interactions between point particles are known to be summarizable in vector quantities called forces applied to any body in interaction; namely the forces on one body from each of several other bodies add up as vectors and the sum of forces applied results in a change in motion which is proportional to the acceleration of the body (second Newton's law $F=ma$ is hence NOT a definition of force but a real law).

Thus force is a vector-like quantity which is a manifestation of the interaction between bodies. If body $A$ acts with force $F$ to the body $B$ then body $B$ acts on body $A$ with the force of the opposite vector value. These two forces do not cancel as they act on different bodies and at different points in space, though they are along the same line.

Sometimes one abstracts the forces on a system of particles from the rest of background by "potential energy" of the particles. Then the background acts on each particle with a force equal to the negative gradient of the potential energy.

In quantum field theory the forces appear mediated by particles which get exchanged between the bodies in interaction. For example, the strong nuclear force is mediated by gluons. There are 4 known fundamental forces in nature and all others are derived from them: the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational force; and the first three are unified in the standard model of particle physics.
