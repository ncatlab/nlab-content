A **locally cartesian closed category** is a category $C$ with finite limits all of whose [[slice category|slice categories]] $C/x$ are [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

Equivalently, it is a category with finite limits such that each pullback functor $f^*: C/y \to C/x$ has a right adjoint $\Pi_f$.  In particular, such pullbacks preserve all colimits.  Therefore, if a locally cartesian closed category has finite colimits, it is automatically a [[coherent category]] and in fact a [[Heyting category]].

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed categories is [[dependent type theory]].
