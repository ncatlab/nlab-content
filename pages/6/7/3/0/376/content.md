A **locally cartesian closed category** is a [[category]] $C$ with a [[terminal object]] and all of whose [[over category|slice categories]] $C/x$ are [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

Equivalently, it is a category with [[finite limit]]s such that each [[pullback]] functor $f^*: C/y \to C/x$ has a right adjoint $\Pi_f$. In particular, such pullbacks preserve all [[colimit]]s. Therefore, if a locally cartesian closed category has [[finite colimit]]s, it is automatically a [[coherent category]] and in fact a [[Heyting category]].

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed categories is [[dependent type theory]].
