A **locally cartesian closed category** is a [[category]] $C$ with a [[terminal object]] and all of whose [[over category|slice categories]] $C/x$ are [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

Equivalently, it is a category with [[finite limit]]s such that each [[pullback]] functor $f^*: C/y \to C/x$ has a right adjoint $\Pi_f$. In particular, such pullbacks preserve all [[colimit]]s. Therefore, if a locally cartesian closed category has [[finite colimit]]s, it is automatically a [[coherent category]] and in fact a [[Heyting category]].

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed categories is [[dependent type theory]].

There are categories which are cartesian closed and not locally cartesian closed, but in which for some $f$ the  pullback functor $f^*: C /y \to C/x$ has a right adjoint. This includes $Cat$ and $Gpd$ and the category of [[crossed complex]]es, where in the latter two cases it is necessary and sufficient for $f$ to be a fibration.
