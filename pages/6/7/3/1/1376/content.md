## Idea

The notion of _monoid_ (or _monoid object_, _algebra_, _algebra object_) in a [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] $C$ is the [[(infinity,1)-category theory|(infinity,1)-categorical]] generalization of [[monoid in a monoidal category]].

## Definition

For $C$ a [[monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with monoidal structure determined by the [[(∞,1)-functor]] 

$$
  p_\otimes : C^\otimes \to N(\Delta)^{op}
$$

a **monoid object** of $C$ is a [[lax monoidal (infinity,1)-functor|lax monoidal (∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  N(\Delta)^{op} \to C^\otimes
$$

This generalizes how, for [[monoidal categories]], [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid objects]] are the same as lax monoidal functors

$$
  * \to C
  \,.
$$

## Examples

* A monoid in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] is an [[A-infinity ring|A-∞ ring]]. If it is a commutative monoid, it is an [[E-infinity ring|E-∞ ring]].
