#Idea#

Recall that a [[monoid]] object or algebra object in a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is the same as a lax monoidal functor

$$
  * \to C
  \,.
$$

This definition generalized to [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal (infinity,1)-categories]] and defines algebra objects for these.


#Definition#

For $C$ a [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] with monoidal structure determined by the $(\infty,1)$-functor 

$$
  p_\otimes : C^\otimes \to N(\Delta)^{op}
$$

an **algebra object** of $C$ is a [[lax monoidal (infinity,1)-functor]]

$$
  N(\Delta)^{op} \to C^\otimes
$$

#Examples#

* An algebra object in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] is an [[E-infinity ring spectrum]].
