* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Elliptic Cohomology I: Spectral Abelian Varieties_, ([pdf](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/Elliptic-I.pdf))
 
A discussion of abelian varieties in the setting of [[spectral algebraic geometry]]. It sets out to answer:

>What does it mean to give an elliptic curve (or, more generally, an
abelian variety) over a cohomology theory $A$? To what extent do such objects behave like their counterparts in classical algebraic geometry?
