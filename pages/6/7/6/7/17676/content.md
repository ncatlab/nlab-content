* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Elliptic Cohomology I: Spectral Abelian Varieties_, ([pdf](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/Elliptic-I.pdf))

It is described as the first in a series of papers whose ultimate aim is to carry out the details of the program outlined in [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]].
 
This first paper provides a discussion of abelian varieties in the setting of [[spectral algebraic geometry]]. It sets out to answer the question:

>What does it mean to give an elliptic curve (or, more generally, an
abelian variety) over a cohomology theory $A$? To what extent do such objects behave like their counterparts in classical algebraic geometry?
