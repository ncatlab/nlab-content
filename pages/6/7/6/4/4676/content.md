## Idea

A _bundle 2-gerbe_ is a special presentation of the total space of a $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$-[[principal 3-bundle]], where $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ is the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#BnU1">circle Lie 3-group</a>.

A [[connection on a bundle 2-gerbe]] is a special cocycle representative for [[circle n-bundles with connection]], hence for degree 4 [[Deligne cohomology]], hence for degree 4 [[Cheeger-Simons differential character]]s.

The definition is built by iteration on the definition of [[bundle gerbe]]:

a bundle 2-gerbe over a manifold $X$ is

* a surjective [[submersion]] $Y \to X$;

* on the [[fiber product]] $Y \times_X Y$ a [[bundle gerbe]] $\mathcal{L} \to Y\times_X Y$;

* a morphims of bundle gerbes $\pi_1^* \mathcal{L} \otimes\pi_2^* \mathcal{L} \to \pi_1^* \mathcal{L}$;

* which is associative up to a choice of coherent [[2-morphism]]s.

## Examples
