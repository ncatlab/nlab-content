## Definition ##

A [[morphism]] $f:hom_A(a,b)$ of a [[dagger 2-poset]] $A$ is a **map** if it is [[functional morphism in a dagger 2-poset|functional]] and [[entire morphism in a dagger 2-poset|entire]]. 

The [[set]] of all maps in $hom_A(a,b)$ is defined as 

$$Map_A(a, b) \coloneqq \{f \in hom_A(a,b) \vert isFunctional(f) \wedge isEntire(f)\}$$
