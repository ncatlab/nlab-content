Noncommutative algebraic geometry studies objects much more general than a single algebra: one wants to glue algebras to more general "systems". This idea has been around from 1980-s. Of course, one needs a good equivalence among systems. One idea is to replace the algebra by a module and glue categories of modules and then look if the categories are equivalent. But the categories of modules loose the track of the Morita equivalence class, which one would like to keep. For example, one wants to define morphisms between such systems as some class of geometric morphisms, but when one restricts to algebras one would like to have only morphisms of algebras, not the bimodules corresponding to nonaffine morphisms. 

This is nicely achieved in a formalism which significantly refines the standard techniques of gluing via corings sketched in chapter 2 of

#### STEP 1: Category of Covers

Given a $k$-algebra $B$, a $B$-[[coring]] $M = (M,\delta^M,\epsilon^M)$ is a comonoid in the category of $B$-bimodules (i.e. $B\otimes B^{op}$-modules). One defines a category of covers as opposite to the category of pairs $(B,M)$ where $B$ is a $k$-algebra and $M$ is a bimodule; one requires that $

### Properties 

Theorem. The category of separated quasi-compact schemes over k is equivalent to a full subcategory of $NSpaces_k$. The category $Alg^{op}_k$ is also equivalent to a full subcategory of
$NSpaces_k$. Category $NSpaces_k$ has finite limits.

Theorem. Construction $(B,M)\to QCoh(B,M)$ extends to a functor from the category $NSpaces_k$ to the category of abelian $k$-linear categories. For separated quasi-compact schemes, it gives usual quasi-coherent sheaves of commutative algebraic geometry. For associative algebras, it gives categories of left modules.
