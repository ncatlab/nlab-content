Let $A$ be a Lawvere theory with generic object $T$. The full subcategory of $A$ generated by the cartesian powers of $T^n$ is also a Lawvere theory, that we denote by $M_n(A)$. In the case of annular theories this is the construction of $n\times n$-matrices over $A$. If we denote by $M_n$ the application of this construction to the initial theory, whose models are simply sets, then we may identify $M_n(A)$ with $M_n\otimes A$. 

It is an amusing exercise to present $M_n$ in terms of generating operations and relations between them.
