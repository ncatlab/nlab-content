Recall that a [[TQFT]] is an [[FQFT]] defined on the $(\infty,n)$-[[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms|category of cobordisms]] whose morphisms are plain cobordisms and diffeomorphisms between these.

In a _conformal_ quantum field theory the cobordisms are equipped with a conformal structure (a Riemannian structure modulo a pointwise rescaling).

A conformal field theory (CFT) is accordingly a functor on such a richer category of conformal [[cobordism]]s.

See the discussion at [[FQFT]] for more details.

The low dimensional case of $2$-dimensional CFT is of course the best understood. It is in fact so predominant that in much of the literature CFT is understood to be $2$-dimensional.

$2$-dimensional conformal field theories have two major applications:

* they describe critical phenomena on surfaces in condensed matter physics;

* they are the building blocks used in [[string theory]]

In the former application it is mostly the _local_ behaviour of the CFT that is relevant. This is encoded in [[vertex operator algebra]]s.

In the [[string theory|string theoretic]] applications the extension of the local theory to a full representation of the 2d conformal cobordism category is crucial. This extension is called _solveing the sewing constraints_ .

...

* The target space structure corresponding to [[defect line]]s in 2d CFT are [[bi-brane]]s.

The special case of _rational_ conformal field theory has been essentially entirely formalized and classified. The classification result for full rational 2d CFT was given by Fjelstad--Fuchs--Runkel--Schweigert
