**Algebra** is the manipulation of symbols without (necessarily) regard for their meaning, especially in a way that can be formalized in [[cartesian logic]].  It is often seen as [[duality|dual]] to [[geometry]].

The word 'algebra' is often also used for an algebraic structure:
* often by default an [[associative unital algebra]];
* more generally a [[monoid object]];
* more generally in a different way, a [[nonassociative algebra]];
* an [[algebra over an operad]], of a [[monad]], a [[PROP]], etc;
* an [[algebra for an endofunctor]];
* a model of any [[algebraic theory]] or anything studied in [[universal algebra]];
* higher categorical analogues, many object/family versions of algebras, for example [[algebroid]]s, and [[pseudoalgebra]]s (or [[2-algebra]]s) over [[pseudomonad]]s (or [[2-monad]]s).

Various fields of mathematics or mathematical concepts can be manipulated in an algebraic or symbolic way, and such approaches or formalized subfields have names like [[categorical algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[homotopical algebra]] and so on. Methods of combinatorics which involve much algebra, and manipulations with [[formal power series]] in particular, are called [[algebraic combinatorics]].

The nlab has a number of entries on particular algebraic structures ([[monoid]], [[semigroup]], [[group]], [[ring]], [[noetherian ring]], [[quasigroup]], [[associative algebra]], [[Lie algebra]], [[coalgebra]], [[dg-algebra]], [[bialgebra]], [[graded algebra]], [[Hopf algebra]], [[coring]], [[quasitriangular bialgebra]], [[lattice]], [[rig]], $\Omega$-[[$\Omega$-group|group]], [[field]], [[perfect field]], [[free field]], [[vertex operator algebra]] etc.), their structural features, parts, "envelopes" or localizations ([[ideal]], [[center]], [[centralizer]], [[normal subgroup]], [[normal closure]], [[normalizer]], [[holomorph]], [[Ore set]], [[Ore localization]]...) and on algebraic structures internal to other categories ([[topological group]], [[Lie group]], [[Lie groupoid]], [[algebraic group]], [[formal group]] etc).

For many algebraic strutures a notion of [[action]] is defined; they embody "symmetry algebras" of some other algebraic objects. The possibilities for realizing a given algebra in such a way are systematically studied in a field called [[representation theory]].
