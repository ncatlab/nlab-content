## Idea

A **first-order set theory** is a [[set theory]] which is a [[first-order theory]]. These include [[unsorted set theories]] like [[ZFC]] and [[fully formal ETCS]], [[simply sorted set theories]] like the two-sorted presentation of [[ETCS]], and [[dependently sorted set theories]] like the usual presentation of [[ETCS]] and [[SEAR]]. 

It contrasts with other approaches to [[set theory]] which are not first-order theories, such as [[set-level type theories]] like [[XTT]] or [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] with a [[type of all propositions]] and [[UIP]]/[[axiom K]], all of which could be considered to be set theories.
