## Idea

_Computability theory_ studies [[mathematics|mathematical]] entities that may be obtained by actual [[computation]] (instead of by less concrete proofs of existence). As such computability theory is similar to _[[constructive mathematics]]_ and to _[[realizability]]_; indeed (emphasized e.g. in ([Bauer 05](#Bauer05))):

Computable mathematics is the [[realizability]] [[interpretation]] of [[constructive mathematics]].

Computability theory deals only with computability in principle and disregards the complexity of computation, that is instead the topic of _[[complexity theory]]_.

The key concept in computability theory is that of a _[[computable function]]_, hence of a [[function]] whose output may be determined from its input by an actual [[computation]]. There are two main types of computability, depending on whether one takes the domain and codomain of computable functions to be _finite string_ from a finite alphabet, hence equivalently [[natural numbers]], or _infinite strings_ from a finite interval, hence sequence of natural numbers. 

In the first case -- "type I computability" -- computable functions are [[partial recursive functions]]. In the second -- "type II computability" -- they are [[continuous functions]] on (quotients of) [[Baire space (computability)|Bair space]] (see at _[[computable function (analysis)]]_).
