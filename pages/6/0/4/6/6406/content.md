## Idea

In [[algebraic number theory]], a *conductor* is a modulus (in the sense of number theory) associated to an abelian [[field extension|extension]] of number fields and reflects its [[ramification of ideals|ramification]] data. It was introduced in the work of Weber at the end of 19th century. It is one of the central notions in [[class field theory]]. A later version is due [[Emil Artin]].
