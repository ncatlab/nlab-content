## Definition 

An [[ordered field]] $F$ is **real closed** if it satisfied the following two properties: 

* Any positive element $x \gt 0$ in $F$ is a square of an element in $F$; 

* Any odd degree polynomial with coefficients in $F$ has a root in $F$. 

## Properties 

Real closed fields can be equivalently characterized by any of the following properties: 

1. $F$ is not algebraically closed, but $F[\sqrt{-1}]$ is. See also [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. 

1. As an ordered field, $F$ is elementarily equivalent to the field of real numbers. 

1. The intermediate value theorem holds for all polynomials with coefficients in $F$.
