A (**Lagrangean** or) **lagrangian submanifold** of a [[symplectic manifold]] $N$ is a submanifold $M$ whose tangent space $TM_x$ at every point $x\in M$ is a lagrangian subspace $TM_x\subset TN_x$, i.e. a maximal isotropic subspace, i.e. a subspace which is simultaneously isotropic and coisotropic with respect to the symplectic bilinear form on $TN_x$. 

Lagrangian submanifolds are of central importance in symplectic geometry and applications.
