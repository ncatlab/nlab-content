A (**Lagrangean** or) **lagrangian submanifold** of a [[symplectic manifold]] $N$ is a [[submanifold]] $M$ whose [[tangent space]] $T M_x$ at every point $x\in M$ is a [[lagrangian subspace]] $T M_x\subset T N_x$, i.e. a maximal isotropic subspace, i.e. a subspace which is simultaneously isotropic and coisotropic with respect to the symplectic bilinear form on $T N_x$. 

Lagrangian submanifolds are of central importance in [[symplectic geometry]] and applications. The concept of lagrangian submanifold has been defined/named by Maslov.
