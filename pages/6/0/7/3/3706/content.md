## Definition


A (**Lagrangean** or) **lagrangian submanifold** of a [[symplectic manifold]] $N$ is a [[submanifold]] $M$ whose [[tangent space]] $T M_x$ at every point $x\in M$ is a [[lagrangian subspace]] $T M_x\subset T N_x$, i.e. a maximal [[isotropic subspace]], i.e. a subspace which is simultaneously isotropic and coisotropic with respect to the symplectic bilinear form on $T N_x$. 

Lagrangian submanifolds are of central importance in [[symplectic geometry]] and applications. The concept of lagrangian submanifold has been defined/named by Maslov. 

## Examples

### Of a Poisson Lie algebroid
 {#OfAPoissonLieAlgebroid}

A [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{P}$ is a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] for $n = 1$. Regarding its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] as the algebra of functions on a [[dg-manifold]], that dg-manifold carries a graded [[symplectic form]] $\omega$. One can then say

###### Definition

A dg-[[Lagrangian submanifold]] of $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$ is also called a **$\Lambda$-structure**. ([&#352;evera, section 4](#Severa)).

###### Proposition

For $(X, \pi)$ the [[Poisson manifold]] underlying a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$, a dg-Lagrangian submanifold of $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$ corresponds to a [[coisotropic submanifold]] of $(X, \pi)$.

###### Remark

The dg-Lagrangian submanifolds also correspond to [[branes]] in the [[Poisson sigma-model]] (see there) on $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$.

### Of a Courant Lie 2-algebroid
 {#OfACourantLie2Algebroid}

A [[Courant Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{C}$ is a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] for $n = 2$. Regarding its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] as the algebra of functions on a [[dg-manifold]], that dg-manifold carries a graded [[symplectic form]] $\omega$. One can then say

+-- {: .num_defn #ForPoissonLieAlgebroidyByLagrangianFoliation}
###### Definition

A dg-[[Lagrangian submanifold]] of $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$ is also called a **$\Lambda$-structure**. ([&#352;evera, section 4](#Severa)).

Hence we might say **real polarization** of $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$ is a foliation by dg-Lagrangian submanifolds.

###### Proposition

The dg-Lagrangian submanifolds of a Courant Lie 2-algebroid $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$ correspond to [[Dirac structures]] on $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$.
