{#Problem} Beware that the latter has an issue in [Lem. 17.1.7](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/TEAK/KateBookFinal.pdf#page=371) (following an analogous problematic statement in [Cole 2006](Strøm+model+structure#Cole06)) where it comes to establishing a [[Strøm model structure]]. This was noticed by [[Richard Williamson]], see [Barthel & Riehl, p. 2 and Rem 5.12 and Sec. 6.1](Strøm+model+structure#BarthelRiehl13) for details.
