\section{Idea}

A _digital signal_ is a [[signal]] which conveys information about digital data, the latter being typically a sequence of [[bit|bits]]. [[IQ modulation]] in one of its several forms is the [[waveform modulation|modulation]] technique typically used to create the signal, that is to say, to construct a [[waveform]] from the digital data.

\section{Sending of a digital signal}

Several steps are typically involved in creating a waveform from a sequence of bits.
