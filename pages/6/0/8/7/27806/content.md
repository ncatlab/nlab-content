## Definition

An **idempotent monoid** is a monoid which is [[idempotent]] in the sense that $x x = x$ for all $x$ in the monoid. 

## Properties

By definition, every idempotent monoid is a [[unital magma|unital]] [[band]]. 

## Examples 

* A [[semilattice]] (in this article, we mean semilattices with identity) is the same thing as a [[commutative]] idempotent monoid. 

* An [[additively idempotent semiring|idempotent semiring]] is a [[semiring]] whose addition operation is an idempotent monoid. 

* A [[Boolean ring]] is a [[ring]] whose multiplication operation is an idempotent monoid. 

* A [[multiplicatively idempotent rig]] is a [[rig]] whose multiplication operation is an idempotent monoid. 

## Internalization

The concept of an idempotent monoid can be [[internalization|internalized]] in any [[monoidal category with diagonals]]; see [[idempotent monoid object]] for more details.
