## Idea
 {#Idea}

*Domain theory* has its origin in

1. topological algebra concerned with Lawson semilattices,

1. [[computer science]], concerned with the problem of finding a viable [[denotational semantics]] for certain theories of [[computability]] (such as the untyped [[lambda calculus]]): this resist straightforward interpretations in terms of plain [[functions]] between sets but does have interpretation in terms of [[monotone functions]] between [[partially ordered sets]] (certain [[lattices]]) &lbrack;[Scott (1970)](#Scott70), [Scott & Strachey (1971)](#ScottStrachey71)&rbrack;. 

The theory has since grown into an area which weaves together diverse strands in [[logic]], [[computability]], [[lattice]] theory, [[general topology]], and [[category theory]]. 

Domain theory can be said to have come into existence with the insight from [Scott (1970)](#Scott70) of interpreting untyped [[lambda calculus]] in terms of [[monotone functions]] between [[continuous lattices]]. In rough terms, the problem can be set out as follows: 

* [[lambda calculus|Lambda calculus]] is a [[syntax]] of [[functions]] and [[functional]] application, whose basic constituents are [[types]], [[terms]] of types, and type and term [[type formation|formation schemes]] with which one can speak of [[product types]] $A \times B$ and [[function types]] $A \Rightarrow B$. 

* One problem is to construct a *meaning* or *[[semantics]]* for such [[syntax]] in terms of "actual" [[sets]] and [[functions]]. The [[categorical semantics]] of [[lambda calculus]] is by [[cartesian closed categories]], in which [[types]] are interpreted as [[objects]] $A$ and [[terms]] are interpreted as ([[generalized element|generalized]]) [[elements]] or "functions" $X \to A$. 

* In so-called untyped lambda calculus (whose syntax is closely connected with the theory of computability and recursive functions), all terms may be regarded as being of the same type $D$ (which therefore need not be mentioned, hence "untyped"), so that intuitively speaking, elements of $D$ and functions on $D$ are treated on one and the same footing. 

* The problem Scott solved is to faithfully model untyped lambda calculus; in categorical terms, the basic problem is to construct a cartesian closed category with just one object $D$ (or rather, two objects: $D$ and a terminal object $1$), so that $D$ is closed under formation of products and function spaces: $D \cong D \times D$ and $D \cong D \Rightarrow D$. Notice that in the category of sets, the only solution is to take $D \cong 1$, so that all terms are then equal ("algorithmic inconsistency"). This is not a faithful modeling of untyped lambda calculus, which has provably unequal terms. 

In 1969, Dana Scott solved this problem topologically: the terms were interpreted as continuous functions on a suitable space $D$ isomorphic to its own function space. This $D$ is called a _domain_. Decades later, we now know many techniques for constructing such domains as suitable objects in cartesian closed categories, but Scott's basic insight, that computability could be interpreted as continuity, 
continues to exert a decisive influence today. 

## Terminology

[[Martín Escardó]] writes on the [nForum](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/10150/dcpo/?Focus=90736#Comment_90736):

> The usual practice of [[domain theory]] papers and talks is to start by defining “domain” for the purposes of the paper or talk. It is a reusable word. Usually only compound words using the word “domain” have a fixed meaning, such as [[Scott domain]] (bounded complete [[algebraic dcpo]]), [[continuous Scott domain]] (bounded complete [[continuous poset|continuous]] [[dcpo]]), [[FS domain]], [[SFP domain]], [[L-domain]]. I wouldn’t use the plain word “domain” in a paper without first explicitly defining it, as it has been used with so many different meanings in the domain theory literature. Also the terminological conventions vary a bit depending on whether domain theory is used for the purposes of computation (e.g., [[denotational semantics|programming language semantics]], and [[computability|theory of computability]]) or [[topology]] and [[algebra]]. For example, in programming language semantics papers one often encounters [[posets]] that have sups of ascending sequences, rather than [[directed sets]], and a least element, because all the authors are interested in is the existence of (least) fixed point of continuous endo-functions, and these assumptions are enough for this purpose. Such [[posets]] are often called domains in such papers. But for applications of [[domain theory]] to [[topology]], [[dcpo|directed completeness]] is what one needs in general, and often we have more (even all sups — for example, a topological space is [[exponentiable object|exponentiable]] if its [[lattice]] of open sets is a [[continuous poset|continuous]] [[dcpo]] — but this [[dcpo]] has all sups and moreover is a [[distributive lattice]], and the continuous distributive lattices are precisely the topologies of [[exponentiable object|exponentiable spaces]], up to isomorphism). Because these applications and communities are so diverse, it is natural to see a divergence of terminology, even if many of the techniques are the same.

> **Abstract**: We prove that a globally hyperbolic [[spacetime]] with its causality relation is a bicontinuous [[poset]] whose interval topology is the manifold topology. From this one can show that from only a countable dense set of events and the causality relation, it is possible to reconstruct a globally hyperbolic spacetime in a purely order theoretic manner. The ultimate reason for this is that globally hyperbolic spacetimes belong to a category that is equivalent to a special category of domains called interval domains. We obtain a mathematical setting in which one can study causality independently of geometry and differentiable structure, and which also suggests that spacetime emerges from something discrete.
