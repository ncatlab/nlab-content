## Idea ##

In the same vein that [[commutative rings]] are to [[integral domains]] and [[GCD rings]] are to [[GCD domains]], [[prevector spaces]] are to [[vector spaces]]. 

## Definition ##

A $R$-[[module]] $V$ is a **prevector space** if $R$ is a [[prefield]]. 

## Examples ##

* Every $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space is a $\mathbb{Q}$-prefield. 

* Every classical vector space is a $F$-prefield for a classical [[field]] $F$ (defined using [[denial inequality]]).

* Every Heyting vector space is a $F$-prefield for a [[Heyting field]] $F$. 

* Every discrete vector space is a $F$-prefield for a [[discrete field]] $F$. 

* Every residue vector space is a $F$-prefield for a [[residue field]] $F$.
