## Definition

A _complex vector bundle_ is a [[vector bundle]] whose fibers are [[complex vector spaces]].

A complex vector bundle with complex 1-dimensional [[fibers]] is a [[complex line bundle]].

More precisely, a __complex vector bundle__ is a [[real vector bundle]] $E\to M$ together with a lifting of its $\mathbf{R}$-module structure $\mathbf{R}\to End(E)$ to a homomorphism of $\mathbf{R}$-algebras $\mathbf{C}\to End(E)$.

The latter lifting is also known as a __complex structure__ on a [[real vector bundle]].

In terms of [[cocycles]], complex vector bundles can be described using cocycle data where the transition maps are complex-linear maps.

## Connections to holomorphic vector bundles

Any [[holomorphic vector bundle]] over a [[complex manifold]] has an underlying complex vector bundle.

Conversely, given a complex vector bundle over a [[complex manifold]], if its transition maps are holomorphic, then it is a [[holomorphic vector bundle]].

## Properties

### Oka-Grauert principle

The _[[Oka-Grauert principle]]_ states that for any [[Stein manifold]] $X$ the holomorphic and the topological classification of [[complex vector bundles]] on $X$ coincide. The original reference is ([Grauert 58](#Grauert58)).
