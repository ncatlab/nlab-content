## Idea

A notion of [[ordered ring]] for [[pseudo-orders]]/[[strict total orders]]. 

## Definition

A **pseudo-ordered ring** or a **strictly totally ordered ring** is an [[ring]] $R$ with a [[pseudo-order]]/[[strict total order]] $\lt$ such that 

* $0 \lt 1$

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$ implies that $0 \lt a + b$; alternatively, $0 \lt a + b$ implies that $0 \lt a$ or $0 \lt b$. 

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then $0 \lt a \cdot b$

## Properties

Every pseudo-ordered ring is a [[partially ordered ring]] given by the [[negation]] of the strict total order. In the presence of [[excluded middle]], every pseudo-ordered ring is a [[totally ordered ring]]. 

Pseudo-ordered rings may have [[zero divisors]]. The pseudo-ordered rings which do not have zero divisors are [[ordered integral domains]]. 

## Examples

* the integers are a pseudo-ordered ring

* the [[Dedekind real numbers]] are a pseudo-ordered ring which in constructive mathematics cannot be proved to be a [[totally ordered ring]].
