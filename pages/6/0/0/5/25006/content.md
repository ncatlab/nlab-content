## Idea

A notion of [[ordered ring]] for [[linear orders]]. 

## Definition

A linearly ordered ring is an [[ring]] $R$ with a [[linear order]] $\lt$ such that 

* $0 \lt 1$

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then $0 \lt a + b$

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then $0 \lt a \cdot b$

## Properties

Every linearly ordered ring is a [[partially ordered ring]] given by the [[negation]] of the linear order. In the presence of [[excluded middle]], every linearly ordered ring is a [[totally ordered ring]]. 

Linearly ordered rings may have [[zero divisors]]. The linearly ordered rings which do not have zero divisors are [[ordered integral domains]]. 

## Examples

* the integers are a linearly ordered ring

* the [[Dedekind real numbers]] are a linearly ordered ring which in constructive mathematics cannot be proved to be a [[totally ordered ring]].
