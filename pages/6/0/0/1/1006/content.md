## Idea

An **$n$-Lie algebra** is defined to be an algebraic structure which

* looks formally like the special case of an $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebra]] for which only the $n$-ary bracket $D_n$ is non-vanishing (see there);

* _but_ without necessarily the grading underlying an $L_\infty$-algebra, and in particular without the requirement that $D_n$ be of homogeneous degree $-1$ in any grading.

Therefore, any "$n$-Lie algebras" that appear in the literature are **not** examples of $L_\infty$-algebras.

So $n$-Lie algebras in this sense in general don't integrate to [[Lie infinity-groupoid]]s via the usual [[Lie theory]]. An important application of $n$-Lie algebras is as formalizations and generalizations of Nambu brackets.

## Re-inventions

The notion of $n$-Lie algebras, for $n=3$, was re-invented by string physicists in 

* Jonathan Bagger, Neil Lambert, _Gauge Symmetry and Supersymmetry of Multiple M2-Branes_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0955))

which sparked a tremendous amount of [activity](http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~ahoop08/klose.pdf). See the blog entry

* [Lie 3-Algebras on the Membrane](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/linfinity_algebras_on_the_memb.html)

for further details and links. And see this blog discussion

* [3-Algebra and Chern-Simons terms](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/03/twisted_differential_string_an.html#c022696)

for discussion about the relation to proper $L_\infty$-algebraic formalism.

Further re-inventions of the concept of $n$-Lie algebras in this context are appearing. For instance in 

* Tamar Friedman, _Orbifold singularities, the LATKe, and Yang-Mills with Matter_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0024))
