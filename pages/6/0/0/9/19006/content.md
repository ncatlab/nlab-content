## Idea

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] generally all [[quantum observables]] are subject to [[renormalization]] choices that may change their value from that computed in [[classical field theory]]. But if [[renormalization conditions]] are imposed, these generally reduce the space of renormalization choices. If a choice of [[renormalization condition]] completely removes the renormalization freedom in an observable, one says that it _protects_ the observable from _receiving quantum corrections_.

Typically this is considered for global [[symmetry of the Lagrangian|symmetries]], the [[renormalization condition]] being that the symmetry is retained after renormalization. In this case one says that that the _symmetry protects_ the quantum observable from receiving quantum corrections.

## Examples

Famous examples of protected quantities are [[masses]] and [[charges]] of [[BPS-states]], which are protected, in this way, by [[supersymmetry]]. The reason why supersymmetric field theory admits more interesting computations than are possible otherwise is that the protection of BPS states allows to compute many [[quantum observables]] that would otherwise not be computatble in practice.

This is for instance the reason why so much is known about the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of extremal (hence [[BPS-state|BPS]]) [[black holes]] (see at _[[black holes in string theory]]_) while comparatively little is known about the quantum properties of non-BPS and hence "non-protected" black holes.
