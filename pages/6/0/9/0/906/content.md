Sequential topological space is a topological space X such that a subset A of X is closed iff it contains all the limit points of all sequences whose members are in A. Every [[Frechet-Uryson space | Frechet-Uryson space]] is a sequential space. Every topological space satisfying first countability axiom is Frechet-Uryson, hence a sequential space.
