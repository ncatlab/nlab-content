A [[topological space]] is _sequential_ if (in a certain sense) you can do topology in it using only [[sequence]]s instead of more general [[net]]s.

Sequential spaces are a kind of [[nice topological space]].

# Definition #

A __sequential topological space__ is a [[topological space]] $X$ such that a subset $A$ of $X$ is closed iff it contains all the limit points of all [[sequence]]s whose members are in $A$.

# Examples #

Every [[Frechet-Uryson space]] is a sequential space. Every topological space satisfying the first countability axiom is Frechet&#8211;Uryson, hence a sequential space.
