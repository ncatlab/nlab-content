## Definition

A [[locale]] is coherent if its [[compact elements]]
are closed under finite meets and any element is a join of compact elements.

A morphism of coherent locales is a morphism $f$ of [[locales]]
such that $f^*$ preserves compact elements.

## Properties

Every coherent locale is a [[coherent topos]] which is also a locale (i.e. [[(0,1)-topos]]). 

Coherent locales are [[spatial locale|spatial]]. This is a special case of the [[Deligne completeness theorem]] for [[coherent toposes]]. The corresponding [[topological spaces]] are called [[coherent spaces]].

Coherent locales classify [[coherent theories]]. If $\mathbb{T}$ is a propositional coherent theory, then the model $L(\mathbb{T})$ is a coherent locale. 

## Category of coherent locales

The category of coherent locales is contravariantly equivalent to the category of [[distributive lattices]].
