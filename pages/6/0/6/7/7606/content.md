## Definition

An [[algebraic scheme]] is __semiseparated__ if it has a [[basis of topology]] by affine open subsets which is closed under finite intersections. 

A __cover__ $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of a scheme by affine open subsets is __semiseparated__ (also spelled semi-separated, some say semiseparating or semi-separating) if $U_i\cap U_j$ is also affine for every pair $(i,j)\in I\times I$. 

A scheme is semiseparated iff it has an affine cover which is semiseparated. 

## Properties

An open subset of a semiseparated scheme is semiseparated.
