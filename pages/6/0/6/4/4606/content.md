## Definition

Given a [[set]] $X$, the __empty function__ to $X$ is the [[function]] to $X$ from the [[empty set]].  This always exists and is unique; in other words, the empty set is an [[initial object]] in the [[category of sets]].

If regarded as a [[bundle]], the empty function is the [[empty bundle]] over its [[codomain]].

## Properties

The empty function to the [[empty set]] is _not_ a [[constant function]].
