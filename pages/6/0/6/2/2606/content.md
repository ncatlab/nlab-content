__Triadic Analogy__

Sometimes I think of it this way:

$$\array{
\arrayopts{\frame{solid}}
Proof Hint & : & Proof & : & Proposition
\\
&& :: &&
\\
Untyped Term & : & Typed Term & : & Type
}$$

Sometimes I think of it this way:

$$\array{
\arrayopts{\frame{solid}}
Proposition & : & Type
\\
& :: &
\\
Proof & : & Typed Term
\\
& :: &
\\
Proof Hint & : & Untyped Term
}$$

What follows may be a slightly different way of looking at the _propositions as types analogy_ than people are used to, so if it's necessary to adjust the title after a while, that's okay, but this name will do for the time being.

In formal work with the calculi of categories, combinators, and related systems, there is some advantage to performing applications and compositions on the right.  In more casual work one naturally reverts to applications and compositions on the left, creating a call for ways to maintain cross-cultural dialogue between the two conventions.

Since we are dealing with non-associative calculi (where "non" = n.o.n. = not of necessity), it is necessary to use parentheses for every application and composition or else to establish determinate conventions for leaving the intended associations tacit.

Assuming that application and composition follow the same convention, we have the following four conventions for the application and association of terms:

* LALA = left application, left association.
* LARA = left application, right association.
* RALA = right application, left association.
* RARA = right application, right association.

There are several ways to mark the convention that governs a given context of discussion, either by using different operation symbols for the different styles of application and composition or else by naming the convention in force by means of indices equivalent to the above descriptors.

# Identity, or the Identifier #

## Step 1 ##

Consider the following problem requirements:

One is given a syntactic specification of the following form:

$$\array{x & = & x\mathop{I}}$$

This amounts to a _paraphrastic definition_ of the operator $\mathop{I}$, where the syntactic frame "$x = x \underline{\phantom{I}}$" is the defining context, or _definiens_, and $\mathop{I}$ is the object to be defined, or _definiendum_.

One is now asked to find a _pure interpretant_ for $\mathop{I}$, that is, an equivalent term in $\langle \mathop{K}, \mathop{S} \rangle$, the _combinatory algebra_ generated by $\mathop{K}$ and $\mathop{S}$, that does as $\mathop{I}$ does.

A handle on the problem can be gotten by observing the following relationships:

$$\array{
x
& = &
(x\mathop{K})(x\mathop{K})
& = &
x(\mathop{K}(\mathop{K}\mathop{S}))
\\
&& \Downarrow &&
\\
\mathop{I}
&& = &&
\mathop{K}(\mathop{K}\mathop{S})
}$$

Thus the sequence of operations indicated by $\mathop{K}(\mathop{K}\mathop{S})$ is a $\langle \mathop{K}, \mathop{S} \rangle$ proxy for $\mathop{I}$.

## Step 2 ##

Assign types in the following specification:

$$\array{x_A & = & x_A \mathop{I}_{A \Rightarrow A}}$$

A suitable type assignment provides a propositional typing for $\mathop{I} : A \Rightarrow A$, whose type, read as a proposition, is a theorem of intuitionistic propositional calculus.

Check that $A \Rightarrow A$ is a theorem of classical propositional calculus.

<table align="center" style="font-weight:bold"><td><pre>
     A   A                         
     o---o       o---o             
     |           |                 
     @     =     @     =     @     
                                   
</pre></td></table>

Check.

## Step 4 ##

__Term Development : Contextual Definition $\rightsquigarrow$ Combinator Construction__

Consider the parse tree of the term $\mathop{I}$ in terms of the primitive combinators $\mathop{K}$ and $\mathop{S}$, that is, the articulation or construction corresponding to the term equation $\mathop{I} = (\mathop{K}(\mathop{K}\mathop{S}))$, as shown here:

<table align="center" style="font-weight:bold"><td><pre>
            K   S     
            o   o     
          K  \ /      
          o  (o)      
           \ /        
     I  =  (o)        
                      
</pre></td></table>

Adding appropriate type-indices to the nodes of this tree will leave us with a proof tree for the propositional type of $\mathop{I} : A \Rightarrow A$.  Thus, the construal or construction of $\mathop{I}$ as $\mathop{K}(\mathop{K}\mathop{S})$ constitutes a hint or clue to the proof of $A \Rightarrow A$ in the intuitionistic propositional calculus.  Although guesswork may succeed in easy cases such as this, a more systematic procedure is to follow the development in Step&nbsp;1, that takes us from contextual specification to operational algorithm, and to carry along the type information as we go, ending up with a typed parse tree for $\mathop{I}$, tantamount to a proof tree for $A \Rightarrow A$.
