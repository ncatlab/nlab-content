This may be a slightly different way of looking at the _propositions as types analogy_ than people are used to, so if it's necessary to adjust the title after a while, that's okay, but this name will do for the time being.

In formal work with the calculi of categories, combinators, and related systems, there is some advantage in doing applications and compositions on the right.  In more casual work one naturally reverts to applications and compositions on the left, calling for ways to maintain cross-cultural dialogue between the two conventions.

Since we are dealing with non-associative calculi (non = n.o.n. = not of necessity), it is necessary to use parentheses for every application and composition or else to establish determinate conventions for leaving them tacit.

Assuming that application and composition follow the same convention, we have the following four conventions for the application and association of terms:

* LALA = left application, left association.
* LARA = left application, right association.
* RALA = right application, left association.
* RARA = right application, right association.

There are several ways to mark the convention that governs a given context of discussion, either by using different operation symbols for the different styles of application and composition or else by naming the convention in force by means of indices equivalent to the above descriptors.
