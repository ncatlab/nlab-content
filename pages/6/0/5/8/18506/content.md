##Idea

A **Clifford&#8211;Klein space form** is a [[double coset space]] $\Gamma \backslash G/H$, where $G$ is a [[Lie group]], $H$ a [[closed subspace|closed]] [[subgroup]] of $G$, and $\Gamma$ a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[subgroup]] of $G$ that [[action|acts]] [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]] and [[free action|freely]] on the [[homogeneous space]] $G/H$. 

The classical space forms are the [[cosets]] of the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ or the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ or the [[hyperbolic space]] $\mathbb{H}^n$ by [[discrete group|discrete]] [[subgroups]] of their [[isometry group]] [[action|acting]] [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]] ([Carmo 92, chapt 8](#Carmo92)).

The first of these are also called _[[spherical space forms]]_. The classification of these was raised as an open problem by [Killing 1891](#Killing1891) and a complete solution was finally compiled by ([Wolf 74](#Wolf74))
