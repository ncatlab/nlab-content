## Idea

For the theory of [[fiber bundles]] to be well-behaved one typically needs to restrict to those that have a _[[local trivialization]]_ not just over any [[open cover]] but over a [[numerable open cover]] -- these are the numerable bundles. Since this condition is automatic if the base space is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] the condition is often not made explicit.

## Definition

\begin{definition}\label{NumerableFiberBundle}
**(numerable fiber bundle)**

A [[fiber bundle]] over a [[topological space]] is called _numerable_ if it admits a [[local trivialization]] over a [[numerable open cover]].

\end{definition}

## Properties


\begin{remark}
Various results for [[classifying spaces]] that classify arbitrary [[fiber bundles]] over [[paracompact topological spaces]] generalizes (only) to a classification of numerable bundles over general topological spaces.

\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
 The conclusion that the bundle projection of a topological [[fiber bundle]] is a [[Serre fibration]] follows generally only for numberable bundles (by [this Prop.](Serre+fibration#MapIsSerreFibrationIfPullbackToNumerableCoverIsSo))
\end{remark}
