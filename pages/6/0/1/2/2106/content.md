## Idea

__Symplectic geometry__ is a branch of [[differential geometry]] studying [[symplectic manifold]]s and some generalizations; it originated as a formalization of the mathematical apparatus of [[classical mechanics]] and geometric optics (and the related [[semiclassical approximation|WKB-method]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and, more generally, the method of stationary phase in [[harmonic analysis]]). A wider branch including symplectic geometry is [[Poisson geometry]] and a sister branch in odd dimensions is [[contact geometry]]. A special and central role in the subject belongs to certain real-like half-dimensional submanifolds, called [[Lagrangian submanifold|lagrangian (or Lagrangean) submanifolds]], which are in some sense classical points. Symplectic geometry radically changed after the 1985 article of [[Mikhail Gromov]] on pseudoholomorphic curves and the subsequent work of [[Andreas Floer]] giving birth to symplectic topology or "hard methods" of symplectic geometry. 


## Applications 

* In its application to [[physics]], symplectic geometry is the fundamental mathematical language for [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], [[geometric quantization]], geometrical optics. 


* A tremendous amount of insight into higher [[Lie theory]] ([[Lie groupoids]], [[Lie ∞-groupoids]], [[Lie ∞-algebroids]]) has derived from [[Alan Weinstein]]'s long-term project of understanding the role of symplectic geometry in [[geometric quantization]]. See there for more details.

[[Zoran Skoda]]: it is true that large influence of Weinstein's program can not be overestimated, but it is not the origin of these considerations; it rather builds up on earlier fundamental works of Kirillov, Kostant, Souriau who invented geometric quantization, all of them originally in symplectic context; and the florishing of the subject from mid 1960s till mid 1980-s is related to their work; and other related tracks of Guillemin, Sternberg, Kashiwara, Karasev, Arnold and so on; and vast developments in harmonic analysis and representation theory (Kostant, Auslander, Vogan, Wallach, Stein...), [[microlocal analysis]] ([[Kashiwara]], Saito, Hormander, Maslov, Karasev, Duistermaat...),  [[integrable system]]s/[[quantum group]]s (this is more into more general Poisson geometry: Lie-Poisson groups, classical r-matrices, bihamiltonian systems...), and  related approaches to quantization (Berezin method, [[coherent state]]s...).

* [[T-duality]] and (related) [[mirror symmetry]] interchange the symplectic data and complex algebraic geometry data. Some cases of both the symplectic and complex algebraic picture can be unified and studied in a broader concept of [[generalized complex geometry]].


## Related concepts

* There is a [[vertical categorification]] of symplectic geometry to [[higher symplectic geometry]]. This involves  [[multisymplectic geometry]] and the geometry of [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]]s. And their combination.
