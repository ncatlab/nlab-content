#Idea#

__Symplectic geometry__ is a branch of [[differential geometry]] studying [[symplectic manifold]]s and some generalizations; it originated as a formalization of the mathematical aparatus of [[classical mechanics]] and geometric optics (and the related WKB-method in [[quantum mechanics]] and, more generally, the method of stationary phase in [[harmonic analysis]]). A wider branch including symplectic geometry is [[Poisson geometry]] and a sister branch in odd dimensions is [[contact geometry]]. A special and central role in the subject belongs to certain real-like half-dimensional submanifolds, called [[Lagrangian submanifold|lagrangian (or Lagrangean) submanifolds]], which are in some sense classical points. Symplectic geometry radically changed after the 1985 article of Gromov on pseudoholomorphic curves and the subsequent work of Floer giving birth to symplectic topology or "hard methods" of symplectic geometry.

# Related concepts and applications #

* In its application to [[physics]], symplectic geometry is the fundamental mathematical language for [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], [[geometric quantization]], geometrical optics. 


* A tremendous amount of insight into higher [[Lie theory]] ([[Lie groupoid]]s, [[Lie ∞-groupoid]]s, [[Lie ∞-algebroid]]s) has derived from [[Alan Weinstein]]'s long-term project of understanding the role of symplectic geometry in [[geometric quantization]]. See there for more details.

[[Zoran ?koda]]: it is true that large influence of Weinstein's program can not be overestimated, but it is not the origin of these considerations; it rather builds up on earlier fundamental works of Kirillov, Kostant, Souriau who invented geometric quantization, all of them originally in symplectic context; and the florishing of the subject from mid 1960s till mid 1980-s is related to their work; and other related tracks of Guillemin, Sternberg, Kashiwara, Karasev, Arnold and so on; and vast developments in harmonic analysis and representation theory (Kostant, Auslander, Vogan, Wallach, Stein...), microlocal analysis (Kashiwara, Saito, Hormander, Maslov, Karasev, Duistermaat...),  integrable systems/quantum groups (this is more into more general Poisson geometry: Lie-Poisson groups, classical r-matrices, bihamiltonian systems...), and  related approaches to quantization (Berezin method, coherent states...).

* There is a [[vertical categorification]] of symplectic geometry, called _multisymplectic geometry_ . For more on this see

  * [[John Baez]], [[Chris Rogers]], _Categorified Symplectic Geometry and the String Lie 2-Algebra_, ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4721))

* [[T-duality]] and mirror symmetry interchange the symplectic data and geometric structure data. Some cases of it can be unified in a broader concept of [[generalized complex geometry]].


# Symplectic geometry and classical Hamiltonian mechanics #

The notion of symplectic geometry may be understood as the mathematical structure that underlies the physics of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. A classical monograph that emphasizes this point of view is

* [[Vladimir Arnold]], _Mathemtical Methods of Classical Mechanics_ Springer.

#Applications#

## Jacobi's elimination of nodes and Witten's "Two dimensional gauge theories revisited." ##


Here is a telegraphic version of the story:  

 Conservation lawas arising from symmetries have been formalized as moment maps by Kirillov, Kostant
and Souriau in late 1960s. Elimination of nodes procedure has been made rigorous by Marsden and Weinstein and, independently, by Meyer, as [[symplectic
reduction]] (symplectic quotient construction).

In the early 1980s Mumford observed that symplectic quotients are closely related to [[geometric invariant theory]] quotients and that many [[moduli space]]s
important in [[algebraic geometry]] and in mathematical physics can be realized as [[symplectic quotient]]s.  Atiyah and Bott used this point of view in "The moment map and equivariant cohomology" to construct
[[cohomology]] classes of [[moduli space]]s of flat [[connection on a bundle|connection]]s on [[Riemann
surface]]s.  In "Two dimensional gauge theories revisited" [[Edward Witten|Witten]] conjectured a method for computing the [[intersection pairing]]s of cohomology classes of symplectic quotients.  The work of Atiyah and
Bott and Witten's conjecture stimulated a large research effort to understand the topology of symplectic quotients in terms of the [[equivariant cohomology]] of the original spaces. Witten's conjecture was
proved by Jeffrey and Kirwan several years later.
