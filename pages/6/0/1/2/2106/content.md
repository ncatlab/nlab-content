__Symplectic geometry__ is a branch of [[differential geometry]] studying [[symplectic manifold]]s and some generalizations; it originated as a formalization of the mathematical aparatus of [[classical mechanics]] and geometric optics (and the related WKB-method in [[quantum mechanics]] and, more generally, the method of stationary phase in [[harmonic analysis]]). A wider branch including symplectic geometry is [[Poisson geometry]] and a sister branch in odd dimensions is [[contact geometry]]. A special and central role in the subject belongs to certain real-like half-dimensional submanifolds, called [[Lagrangian submanifold|lagrangian (or Lagrangean) submanifolds]], which are in some sense classical points. Symplectic geometry radically changed after the 1985 article of Gromov on pseudoholomorphic curves and the subsequent work of Floer giving birth to symplectic topology or "hard methods" of symplectic geometry.

Some random remarks:


* [[T-duality]] and mirror symmetry interchange the symplectic data and geometric structure data. Some cases of it can be unified in a broader concept of [[generalized complex geometry]].

* In its application to [[physics]], symplectic geometry is the fundamental mathematical language for [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], [[geometric quantization]], geometrical optics. 

* A tremendous amount of insight into higher [[Lie theory]] ([[Lie groupoid]]s, [[Lie ∞-groupoid]]s, [[Lie ∞-algebroid]]s) has derived from [[Alan Weinstein]]'s long-term project of understanding the role of symplectic geometry in [[geometric quantization]]. See there for more details.

[[Zoran ?koda]]: it is true that large influence of Weinstein's program can not be overestimated, but it is not the origin of these considerations; it rather builds up on earlier fundamental works of Kirillov, Kostant, Souriau who invented geometric quantization, all of them originally in symplectic context; and the florishing of the subject from mid 1960s till mid 1980-s is related to their work; and other related tracks of Guillemin, Sternberg, Kashiwara, Karasev, Arnold and so on; and vast developments in harmonic analysis and representation theory (Kostant, Auslander, Vogan, Wallach, Stein...), microlocal analysis (Kashiwara, Saito, Hormander, Maslov, Karasev, Duistermaat...),  integrable systems/quantum groups (this is more into more general Poisson geometry: Lie-Poisson groups, classical r-matrices, bihamiltonian systems...), and  related approaches to quantization (Berezin method, coherent states...).
