## Idea

What is called the _hierarchy problem_ is an issue in [[phenomenology]] and [[model (in theoretical physics)|model building]], notably in the [[standard model of particle physics]], concerning discrepancies between the [[electroweak]] and [[Planck scale]]. For instance, the masses of the [[W-boson|W]] and [[Z-boson|Z]] particles, the force carriers of the [[weak nuclear force]], are about 10,000 trillion times smaller than the [[Planck mass]]. Thus there is a huge hierarchy in the mass scales of [[weak nuclear forces]] and [[gravity]]. See [Strassler](#Strassler) for review.

## Proposed solutions

### Just an artifact

[Mooij & Shaposhnikov 2021](#MooijShaposhnikov21) suggested that the hierarchy problem might not have any physical meaning, rather being a mere artifact of a certain formulation of the quantum field theory and/or model of the Standard model, and that if a different formulation was chosen the hierarchy problem can be avoided entirely. 


### In M-theory on $G_2$-manifolds
  {#InMTheoryOnG2Manifols}

In the context of [[M-theory on G₂-manifolds]] (the [[G₂-MSSM]]) a generic solution to the [[hierarchy problem]] is proposed in ([Acharya-Kane-Kumar 12, section  V.A.2 (p. 10-11)](#AcharyaKaneKumar12)) due to control over [[non-perturbative effects]] from [[membrane instantons]], which due to their exponential nature, provide the exponential hierarchy.
