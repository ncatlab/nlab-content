## Idea

Commutative monoidal categories are [[symmetric monoidal categories]] whose  [[tensor product]] is _strictly_ [[associative]] and [[unital]] (as for [[permutative categories]]), but also strictly [[commutative monoid|commutative]], in that the [[associators]], [[unitors]], and [[braidings]] are all the  [[identity natural transformation]]. 

Notice that the [[coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories]] only says that [[symmetric monoidal categories]] are symmetric monoidally equivalent to [[strict monoidal categories]] whose [[braidings]], however, may not be given by the identity.

## Examples

Commutative monoidal categories are the natural type of category that [[Petri nets]] freely generate ([Baez-Master 18, Section 2](#BaezMaster18)).   

The symmetric monoidal category of [[line bundles]] on a topological space, or [[smooth line bundles]] on a manifold, or [[invertible sheaf|invertible sheaves]] on a variety or scheme, is symmetric monoidally equivalent to a commutative monoidal category under the usual tensor product of these structures.

Any abelian group object in $Cat$ is a commutative monoidal category.

## Definition

A commutative monoidal category is a [[commutative monoid object]]  in [[Cat]]  with its [[cartesian product]].  Equivalently, it is an [[internal category]] in the category of [[commutative monoids]].

Explicitly, the data of a commutative monoidal category are:

* A commutative monoid of objects $C_1$,

* a commutative monoid of morphisms $C_0$,

* source and target [[monoid homomorphisms]] $s,t \colon C_1 \to C_0$,

* an identity assigning monoid homomorphism $i \colon C_0 \to C_1$ and,

* a homomorphism $\circ \colon C_1 \times_C_0 C_1 \to C_1$ representing composition.

These homorphisms are required to satisfy the axioms of a [[category]]. In particular, because composition is a commutative monoid homomorphism, it satisfies the [[interchange law]]

$$ (g \circ f) + (h \circ k) = (g + h) \circ (f + k) $$

whenever all composites are defined.

## Characterization up to equivalence

One might [[conjecture]] that a symmetric monoidal category is symmetric monoidally equivalent to a commutative monoidal category iff all its self-braidings

$$   B_{x,x} \colon x \otimes x \to x \otimes x $$

are identity morphisms.  Note that since a commutative monoidal category has this property, and this property is invariant under symmetric-monoidal-equivalence, the "only if" part of the characterization is certainly true.

This conjecture was proved in [Kim 16](#Kim16).
