A [[subcategory]] $S$ of a category $C$ is __full__ if its [[inclusion functor]] is [[full functor|full]]; this inclusion functor is often called a __full embedding__ or a __full inclusion__.

To specify a full subcategory $S$ of $C$, it is enough to say which [[object]]s belong to $S$.  Then $S$ must consist of all [[morphism]]s whose [[source]] and [[target]] belong to $S$ (and no others).  One speaks of the _full subcategory on_ a given set of objects.

Any [[full and faithful functor]] $F: D \to C$ defines a full subcategory of $C$, the full subcategory on the image (or [[essential image]]) of $F$, which (either way) will be [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $D$.  Thus we may consider any category $D$ equipped with such a functor to be a full subcategory of $C$.
