## Definition

If one accepts the notion of [[subcategory]] without any qualification (as discussed there), then:

A [[subcategory]] $S$ of a category $C$ is a **full subcategory** if its [[inclusion functor]] is a [[full functor]]. 

This inclusion functor is often called a __full embedding__ or a __full inclusion__.

Notice that to specify a full subcategory $S$ of $C$, it is enough to say which [[object]]s belong to $S$.  Then $S$ must consist of all [[morphism]]s whose [[source]] and [[target]] belong to $S$ (and no others).  One speaks of the _full subcategory on_ a given set of objects.

This means that equivalently we can say:

A functor $F : S \to C$ exhibits $S$ as a **full subcategory** of $C$ precisely if it is a [[full and faithful functor]].
($S$ is the [[essential image]] of $F$).
