Unlike [[Čech cohomology]], [[Čech homology]] is not a homology theory in the sense of Eilenberg-Steenrod: the exactness axiom (long exact sequence in homology) does not hold. A correction to the basic &#268;ech definition was given by [[Sibe Mardešić]]. The resulting "strong homology theory" agrees with [[singular homology]] on the spaces having homotopy type of [[CW complexes]], and does give long exact sequence of pairs $(X,A)$ where $X$ is paracompact and $A$ closed in $X$; moreover for metric compacta it satisfies not only all the axioms of Eilenberg-Steenrod, but also the relative homeomorphism axiom and the [[wedge axiom]]. 

The only homology theory on the metric compacta satisfying not only the Eilenberg-Steenrod but also the wedge axiom is the [[Steenrod-Sitnikov homology]] theory, hence the strong homology agrees with it.
