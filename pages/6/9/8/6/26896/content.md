## Idea

The *Heine-Cantor theorem* states that, given a [[pointwise continuous function]] $f \,\colon\, M \to N$ between [[metric spaces]], that if $M$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] then $f$ is [[uniformly continuous function|uniformly continuous]]. 

A special case, in [[real analysis]], is that every [[pointwise continuous function]] from the [[unit interval]] to the [[real numbers]] is [[uniformly continuous function|uniformly continuous]].
