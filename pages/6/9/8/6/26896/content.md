## Idea

The Heine-Cantor theorem states that every given [[metric spaces]] $M$ and $N$ and a [[pointwise continuous function]] $f$ from $M$ to $N$, if $M$ is a [[compact]] metric space, then $f$ is a [[uniformly continuous function]]. 

One special case of the Heine-Cantor theorem is the case from real analysis that every pointwise continuous function from the [[unit interval]] to the [[real numbers]] is uniformly continuous.
