## Idea

On the one hand, [[infinity-groupoids|$\infty$-groupoids]] form an [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]] ($Grpd_\infty$), while their [[stabilization]] -- plain [[spectra]] form -- form instead a [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable $(\infty,1)$-category]]; on the other hand, the collection of *[[parameterized spectra]]*, parameterized over [[infinity-groupoids|$\infty$-groupoids]], forms again an [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]]: the "[[tangent (infinity,1)-topos|tangent $(\infty,1)$-topos]]" $T Grpd_\infty$.

In search for a term to capture this curious phenomenon more generally, [Joyal 2015](#Joyal15) proposed to call a ([[pointed (infinity,1)-category|pointed]]) [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable $(\infty,1)$-category]] an "$\infty$-locus" if the collection of its $Grpd_\infty$-parameterized objects (namely [[(infinity,1)-functors|$(\infty,1)$-functors]] $Grpd_\infty \to \mathcal{C}$) forms an [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]]. 

Notice that the terminology "locus" here is unrelated to the common use of *[[locus]]* in mathematics. Compare the earlier proposal in [Joyal 2008](#Joyal08) to say "[[logos]]" for *[[(infinity,1)-category|$(\infty,1)$-category]]*, which is similarly ideosyncratic.

More generally, one may consider "loci" given by [[(infinity,2)-sheaves|$(\infty,2)$-sheaves]] on any [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]] ([Hoyois 2019](#Hoyois19)). 


## Examples

In the above motivating example, $\mathcal{C} =$ [[Spectra]]. In fact, every [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable]] [[stable (infinity,1)-category|styable $(\infty,1)$-category]] is a Joyal $\infty$-locus (essentially by the [stable Giraud theorem](stable+infinity-category#StableGiraud), cf. [Hoyois 2019, p. 1 and Ex. 7](#Hoyois19)).
But, for instance, not just [[spectra]] but already [[prespectra]] and in fact just [[pointed homotopy types]] form a Joyal $\infty$-locus, in this sense. 

If one drops the requirement that $\mathcal{C}$ be [[pointed (infinity,1)-category|pointed]], then every [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]] is a Joyal $\infty$-locus (cf. [Hoyois 2019, Ex. 6](#Hoyois19)).


For the case over over more general [[base (infinity,1)-toposes|base $(\infty,1)$-toposes]]: [[sheaves of spectra]] over an [[(infinity,1)-site|$(\infty,1)$-site]] $\mathcal{S}$ may be [[parameterized spectrum|parameterized]] over objects of the [[infinity-stack (infinity,1)-topos|$\infty$-stack $(\infinity,1)$-topos]] $Sh_\infty(\mathcal{S})$ and the collection of these parameterized sheaves of spectra forms the [[tangent (infinity,1)-topos|tangent $(\infty,1)$-topos]] $T Sh_\infty(\mathcal{S})$. Analogous statements hold more generally for [[n-excisive (infinity,1)-functors|$n$-excisive $(\infty,1)$-functors]] into any [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]] (see [there](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/n-excisive+functor#nExcisiveFunctorsFormInfinityTopos)).
