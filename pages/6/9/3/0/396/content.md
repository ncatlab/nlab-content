A **full and faithful functor** is, surprisingly enough, a [[functor]] which is both [[full functor|full]] and [[faithful functor|faithful]].  "Full and faithful" is sometimes shortened to "fully faithful" or "ff."   See also [[subcategory]].

Together with [[bo functor|bijective-on-objects functors]], ff functors form an [[bo-ff factorization system|orthogonal factorization system]] on $Cat$.
