__Robin Hartshorne__ is an algebraic geometer at Berkeley. At some point he was associated with Grothendieck's school, for example his book _Residues and duality_ (1966) is mainly a writeup of a Grothendieck cycle of seminars. 

His textbook __Algebraic geometry__ (1977) is now a classic of the theory of [[scheme]]s. The definition of [[coherent sheaf]] in that book differs from the definition in [[EGA]] and is well behaved on [[Noetherian scheme]]s.
