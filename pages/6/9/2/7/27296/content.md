## Idea

In [[physics]], specifically in [[field theory]], a *gauge field* is a type of [[field (physics)|field]] in [[gauge theory]].

The eponymous property of gauge fields is that they are identified only up to [[equivalences]] called *[[gauge transformations]]*.

The archetypical example of a gauge field is the [[electromagnetic field]] in ([[classical field theory|classically]]) [[electromagnetism]] and ([[quantum field theory|quantumly]]) [[quantum electrodynamics]].
