A [[full subcategory]] $T$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ of (left or right) modules over a ring is a __Serre subcategory__ if for any [[exact sequence]]
$$
0\to M\to M'\to M''\to 0
$$
$M'$ is in $T$ iff $M$ and $M''$ are in $T$. Following Serre, one then defines the category $A/T$ whose objects are objects of $A$ and morphisms are defined in $A/T$ as
$$\mathrm{Hom}_{A/T}(X,Y) = \mathrm{colim}\, \mathrm{Hom}_A(X',Y/Y')$$
where the colimit is over all $X',Y'$ in $A$ such that $Y'$ and $X/X'$ are in $T$. The quotient category $A/T$ is abelian.

Very often the same definition of Serre subcategory is used for an arbitrary abelian category $A$;
but in fact, at least when the abelian category is not a [[Grothendieck category]], it is more appropriate to ask for an additional condition in the definition of Serre subcategory so that the standard theorems on correspondences with other canonical data in localization theory remain valid.

For any subcategory of an abelian category $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the [[full subcategory]] of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which any (nonzero) [[subquotient]] of $N$ in $T$
has a (nonzero) [[subobject]] from $T$.  This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ with $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].
Moreover $\bar{T}$ is always [[thick subcategory|thick]] in the stronger sense
(that is, thick and topologizing). 
Serre subcategories in the stronger sense are those subcategories which are stable under the operation $\bar{}$.
