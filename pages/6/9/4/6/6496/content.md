__Gersten resolution__ is certain exact sequence of Zariski sheaves coming from a spectral sequence related to the study of motivic sheaves.

Voevodsky: Homology of schemes II: p 46 has a brief general discussion of Gersten resolution for the Zariski sheaf associated to a homotopy invariant [[Pretheory]].

Some things may be found in articles of Geisser, for example in K-theory handbook.

Rost: Chow groups with coefficients. Studies an abstract setup which applies to Gersten resolutions.
