A __0-poset__ is a [[truth value]]. Compare the concept of $1$[[1-poset|poset]] (a [[partial order|poset]]) and $(-1)$-[[(-1)-poset|poset]] (which is trivial); compare also with $(-1)$-[[(-1)-category|category]] and $0$-[[0-groupoid|groupoid]], which mean the same thing for different reasons.

The point of 0-posets is that they complete some patterns in the [[periodic table]] of $n$-categories, in particular the progression of $n$-[[n-poset|posets]].

For example, there should be a $0$-[[0-category|category]] of $0$-posets; a $0$-category is simply a [[set]], and this set is the set of truth values, classically
$$
  (-1)Pos := \{\bot, \top\}
  \,.
$$
Actually, we should expect the $0$-category of $0$-posets to be a $1$-poset; this is simply a poset, and indeed truth values do form a poset (where $\bot \leq \top$).

If we equip the category of $0$-posets with its [[cartesian monoidal category|monoidal cartesian structure]] (which is [[conjunction]], the logical AND operation), then an $\infty$-[[enriched category|category enriched]] over this should be a $1$-poset; and indeed it is (up to [[equivalence of categories]]) a poset (although up to isomorphism only, a category enriched over truth values under conjunction is actually a set equipped with a [[preorder]]).

See [[(-1)-category]] for references on this sort of [[negative thinking]].
