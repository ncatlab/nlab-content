## Idea

Topological order is an order in quantum [[solid state physics|phase of matter]] which is beyond Landau [[symmetry breaking]] order. At long distance
and low energy (ie at macroscopic level), topological order is 
defined by [[topological degeneracy]] of the ground states and the [[non-Abelian geometric phases]] obtained by deforming the degenerate ground states. This is a characteristic of a special case of wider notion of [[topological state of matter]], see there.
