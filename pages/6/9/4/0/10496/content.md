## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[solid state physics]], by *topological order* ([Wen 89](#Wen89),  [Wen & Niu 90](#WenNiu90), [Wen 91](#Wen91), [93](#Wen93), [95](#Wen95), [Gu & Wen 09, p. 2](#GuWen09), [Chen, Gu & Wen 10](#ChenGuWen2010)) one refers to a phenomenon that may (but need not) be exhibited by [[quantum materials]] that are in a [[topological phase of matter]]. Hence there is an implication

$$
  \text{topological order}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \text{topological phase}
  \,,
$$

but not the other way around.

Specifically, the [[ground state]] of a topologically ordered material is rich in structure (besides being topologically stable), which need not be the case for a general topological phase. In particular a topologically ordered ground state is "degenerate" (a standard but somewhat unfortunate jargon in this context: it really refers to the *[[energy]]* [[eigenvalues]] being degenerate) in that there is a $\geq 2$-dimensional Hilbert space of [[quantum states]] that all have the same lowest energy (within experimentally relevant approximation). 

Moreover, for this to qualify as topologically ordered, one typically demands that in its degenerate ground state the system may exhibit "[[anyon|anyonic]] [[defects]]". A popular more succinct way of making this somewhat more precise is to say that the [[dynamics]] of (the [[electrons]] in) a topologically ordered material, when restricted to the energy=0 ground states, is a [[topological field theory]] equal or akin to a [[Chern-Simons theory]] with [[Wilson line]]-insertions: these Wilson lines being the [[worldlines]] of the [[anyon]]-[[defects]]. 

In short then, topological order is meant to be that aspect of [[topological phases of matter]] which is related to the existence of [[anyons]] in the material, in one way or other. Via this relation, topological order is closely related to considerations in [[topological quantum computation]].


### Via degenerate anyonic ground states
 {#ViaDegenerateAnyonicGroundStates}

The definition is traditionally a little vague, but the hallmark of a *topological order* is meant to be the presence, in a [[topological phase of matter|topological phase]], of some or preferably all of the following phenomena ([Gu & Wen 09, p. 2](#GuWen09), called the "modern day philosopher's stone" in [Tsvelik 2014b](parafermion#Tsvelik14b)):

1. degenerate [[ground state]] ([Wen 89, p. 4](#Wen89), [Wen 95, Sec. 1.1](#Wen95));  

1. [[Berry connection]] with [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[holonomy]];

1. [[anyon]] excitations/defects whose [[wavefunctions]] constitute [[braid group representations]] ("[[anyon statistics|fractional statistics]]").

The original articles ([Wen 89](#Wen89),  [Wen & Niu 90](#WenNiu90), [Wen 91](#Wen91), [93](#Wen93), [95](#Wen95)) proposed to declare that [[topological phase of matter|topological phases]] with distinct ground state degeneracy exhibit distinct topological order. The demand that also the [[Berry connection]] should be non-abelian for there to be a topological order seems to appear first in [Wen 91 review](#Wen91Review) (then also [Gu & Wen 09, p. 2](#GuWen09)). Or maybe the claim is rather that two distinct topological orders may have the same ground state degeneracy but be distinguished by their Berry connections.


\begin{remark}\label{RelationBetweenDefiningConditions}
**(relation between these conditions)**
\linebreak
By "degenerate ground state" one just means that the sub-[[Hilbert space]] of [[quantum states]] (for crystalline materials these are the quantum states of  [[electrons]] in the crystal lattice of [[atomic nuclei]]) of those that have the lowest possible [[energy]], has [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] $\geq 2$.

{#RelationToSRE} (It has been proposed that the presence of "[[short-range entanglement]]" in [[quantum materials]] implies that the ground state Hilbert space is 1-dimensional. In this sense, the condition that the ground state be degenerate implies that there is *no* "[[short-range entanglement]]" if there is "topological order".)

Since (by [[Bloch-Floquet theory]]) the quantum states of these electrons form the [[space of sections]] of the Bloch bundle, and since (by assumption of a [[topological phase of matter|topological phase]]) the ground state involves sections only of the gapped [[sub-bundle]] which is called the *[[valence bundle]]*, this is closely related to the valence bundle having [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]] $\geq 2$.

(In making these statement there is some tacit switching between single-electron theory and its [[second quantization]] involved, sorting out of which would be necessary for being more precise about these matters.)

But since the [[Berry connection]] is a [[connection on a vector bundle|connection]] on the [[valence bundle]], it can have non-abelian [[holonomy]] (namely in [[unitary group|U(n)]] for $n \geq 2$) only if the bundle's rank is $\geq 2$.

Similarly, the presence of [[anyons]] broadly means that there are families of [[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatic defomrations]] of the material which have the effect of transforming the [[ground state]] by [[linear operators]] forming a [[braid group representation]]. This is most interesting when the representation is non-abelian, which again requires that the Hilbert space of ground states that it is represented on has dimension $\geq 2$. 

However, there are also non-trivial "abelian anyons", namely braid group representations which are just complex 1-dimensional, and -- even if not as interesting as their non-abelian cousins -- these are counted as perfectly valid instances of the concept of anyons (in fact it was first a struggle and then a breakthrough to detect abelian anyons in [[experiment]]). Some authors, especially those using the language of [[fusion categories]] to speak about anyons, require of a "topological order" only that it contains anyons and possibly just abelian anyons, in which case it is maybe not so clear whether the ground state needs to be degenerate and/or the Berry connection be non-abelian.
  
\end{remark}

### Via topological entanglement entropy
 {#ViaTopologicalEntanglementEntropy}

It is now thought that some/all of the [above](#ViaDegenerateAnyonicGroundStates) characteristics may be captured [[quantum information theory|quantum information theoretically]] in terms of the [[entanglement entropy]] of the [[ground state]]:

The non-degeneracy of the ground state is related to *absence* of "[[short-range entanglement]]";
and the existence of anyon excitations is related to the *presence* of "[[long-range entanglement]]" ([Chen, Gu & Wen 10, Sec. 5](#ChenGuWen2010)) witnessed by a non-vanishing *[[topological entanglement entropy]]* ([Kitaev & Preskill 2006](entanglement+entropy#KitaevPreskill06), [Levin & Wen 2006](entanglement+entropy#LevinWen06)).  

Often one sees topological order being related also to (1) *strong interaction* and/or (2) *strong quantum correlation* ([Wen 91 review](#Wen91Review)) between the electrons (while the classical [[electron band theory]] that gives rise to the widely-accepted [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]] assumes that it is sensible to *neglect* the interaction of electrons between each other and only retain their interaction to an effective Coulomb [[background field]]).

{#BewareOfCorrelation} Beware that the use of the term "correlation" in the context of topological order (cf. [Wen 91 review ](#Wen91Review)) is always meant as "quantum correlation" and specifically as "non-classical quantum correlation"  and as such used as a synonym for *[[quantum entanglement]]* (cf. [ZCZW 19, ยง1.5](#ZCZW19) and generally [Luo & Luo 03, p. 3](entanglement#LuoLuo03)). In contrast, long-range *classical correlation* is indicative of *non-topological* [[Landau theory]]-phases and hence the opposite of what is relevant here. 
 
Together with the entanglement-theoretic characterization just mentioned, the logic here seems to be the following sequence of schematic implications:

\begin{tikzcd}[

  row sep=-2pt,

The first steps in this sequence is intuitively plausible and widely expected to hold (eg. [Lu & Viyah 2022, p. 1](entanglement+entropy#LuVijay22)) but not currently derivable from first principles ([Zaanen, Liu, Sun & Schalm 2015, p. 527](entanglement+entropy#ZaanenLiuSunSchalm15)):
 
If the [[electromagnetic field|Coulomb]] interaction between the electrons -- which by itself is certainly strong and long-range -- cannot be neglected (hence if the averaging- or screening-effects that make [[electron band theory]] work do not apply) then this strong interaction makes the electrons in the ground state be correlated with each other, one way or other, across non-negligible distances; and quantum mechanically this leads to the ground state's entanglement entropy having long-range contributions, which,  essentially by definition, means that it has a constant contribution by the *topological* entanglement entropy.
