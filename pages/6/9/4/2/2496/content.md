[[!redirects higher order propositions]]

# Idea #

If functions of type $X \to \mathbb{B}$ are propositions about things in $X$, then functions of type $(X \to \mathbb{B}) \to \mathbb{B}$ are propositions about propositions about things in $X$, the first of a series of __higher order propositions__ based on $X$.
