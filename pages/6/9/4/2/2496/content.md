[[!redirects higher order propositions]]

# Idea #

If functions of type $X \to \mathbb{B}$ are propositions about things in $X$, then functions of type $(X \to \mathbb{B}) \to \mathbb{B}$ are propositions about propositions about things in $X$, the first of a series of __higher order propositions__ to be based on $X$.

# Higher order propositional expressions #

By way of equipping the discussion with a modicum of concrete material, let's begin with a consideration of higher order propositions and logical operators that stem from the ordinary propositions on 1 and 2 variables.

## Higher order propositions and logical operators $(n = 1)$ ##

A _higher order proposition_ is, very roughly speaking, a proposition about propositions.  If the original order of propositions is a class of [[indicator functions]] $f : X \to \mathbb{B}$, then the next higher order of propositions consists of maps of the type $m : (X \to \mathbb{B}) \to \mathbb{B}$.

For example, consider the case where $X = \mathbb{B}$.  Then there are exactly four propositions $f : \mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{B}$, and exactly sixteen higher order propositions that are based on this set, all bearing the type $m : (\mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{B}) \to \mathbb{B}$.

# Functional conception of quantification theory #

Up till now quantification theory has been based on the assumption of individual variables ranging over universal collections of perfectly determinate elements.  Merely to write down quantified formulas like $\forall_{x \in X} f(x)$ and $\exists_{x \in X} f(x)$ involves a subscription to such notions, as shown by the membership relations invoked in their indices.  Reflected on pragmatic and constructive principles, these ideas begin to appear as problematic hypotheses whose warrants are not beyond question, projects of exhaustive determination that overreach the powers of finite information and control to manage.  Therefore, it is worth considering how we might shift the medium of quantification theory closer to familiar ground, toward the predicates themselves that represent our continuing acquaintance with phenomena.
