## Idea

A _higher-order logic_ is any [[logic]] which features _higher-order predicates_, which are [[predicates]] of predicates or of operations.  If we think of a predicate as a [[function]] to [[truth values]], then a higher-order predicate is a function on a [[power set]] or a [[function set]].

[[type theory|Typed]] higher-order logic may be called higher-order type theory. Typed higher-order [[intuitionistic logic]] is often identified with the [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]].

There are also examples of [[dependent type theory|dependently typed]] higher-order logics. One example of a dependently typed higher-order logic is a [[dependent type theory]] with a separate [[type]] [[judgment]], [[identity types]], [[dependent sum types]], [[dependent product types]], [[weak function extensionality]], a [[type of all propositions]], and a [[natural numbers type]]. This uses the [[propositions as some types]] interpretation of [[dependent type theory]].
