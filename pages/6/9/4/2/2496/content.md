A _higher-order logic_ is any [[logic]] which features _higher-order predicates_, which are [[predicates]] of predicates or of operations.  If we think of a predicate as a [[function]] to [[truth values]], then a higher-order predicate is a function on a [[power set]] or a [[function set]].

Higher-order [[intuitionistic logic]] is often identified with the [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]].
