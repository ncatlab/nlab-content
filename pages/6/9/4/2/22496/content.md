## Idea

For $G$ a [[group]], there is a [[pointed connected groupoid|pointed connected]] [[groupoid]] $(G \rightrightarrows \ast)$ with

* a single [[object]],

* [[morphisms]] the [[elements]] of $G$, 

* [[composition]] the group operation in $G$.

This may be understood as the "[[delooping]]" of $G$ in the ambient [[(infinity,1)-topos]], and is, as such, naturally denoted $\mathbf{B}G$.
