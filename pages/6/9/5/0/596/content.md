[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

I'd like to eventually describe some useful concept here that should go by the name _multispan_ and _multispan composition_. A beginning is made here

* [[multispansJan24.pdf:file]]

This is related to discussions at the $n$-Caf&#233; at these places:

* general idea (or not) of multispans [blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/11/category_theory_and_biology.html#c021530)

* extended cobordisms as multispans [blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html#c021486)

* traces on multispans and co-traces on spans [blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html#c021537)

#Remarks#

* The concept of multispans as described above is akin to, in fact inspired by or maybe even a realization of the idea of a [[hyperstructure]] by [[Nils Baas]].

#Related concepts#

* [[span trace]]
