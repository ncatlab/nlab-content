A [[subcategory]] $D$ of a category $C$ is called __replete__ if it respects [[isomorphism]] of morphisms in the [[arrow category]] of $C$.

## Definition

A subcategory $D$ of $C$ is __replete__ if for any $x$ in $D$ and any isomorphism $f:x\cong y$ in $C$, both $y$ and $f$ are also in $D$.

Equivalently, if $f \in D$ and $f \cong g$ in $Arr(C)$, then $g \in D$.
