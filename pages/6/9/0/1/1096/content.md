The notion of [[presheaf]] today is technically synonymous with ([[contravariant functor|contravariant]]) [[functor] $F : S^{op} \to A$ -- albeit a functor is called a [[presheaf]] only if it is being used in a certain way, notably when its domain has the structure of a [[site]] and there is the potential to consider the [[sheafification]] of the functor to a [[sheaf]].

Historically this formalization was abstracted from the special case where the domain category $S = O(X)$ is the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]].
