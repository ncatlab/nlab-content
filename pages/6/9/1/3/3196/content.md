The **Morse theory** is the method of studying the topology of a smooth manifold $M$ by study of [[Morse functions]] $M\to\mathbb{R}$ and their associated gradient flows. 

Classical Morse theory centered around simple statements like Morse inequalities, concerning just the Betti numbers. 

A variant using multivalued functions is the Novikov-Morse theory.

There are some infinite dimensional generalizations like Floer instanton homology for 3-dimensional manifolds and also the Hamiltonian variant of the Floer homology (and cohomology) for the (finite dimensional) symplectic manifolds. Especially well studied is the case of the cotangent bundle of a differentiable manifold with its standard symplectic structure; this is sometimes called Floer-Oh homology. Floer homology has been partly motivated by Arnold's conjecture on periodic trajectories in classical mechanics. Symplectic variant of Floer cohomology is related to quantum cohomology.
