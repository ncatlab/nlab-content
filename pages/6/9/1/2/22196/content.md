\section{Overview}

The physical existence of the [[Home Page|nLab]] is funded by donations (see [below](#Donate)) which are received via a mechanism handled by the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/), with the kind administrative help of [[Brendan Fong]].

The nLab's [[nlabmeta:technical board]] decides about how to use these funds for paying server rent and sysadmin services (see [further below](#Expenditures)).

\section{Available funds}

As of 05 May 2022 the funds available to the nLab due to donations are 

* USD 7280.59 .




\section{Expenditures}
 {#Expenditures}

The [[nlabmeta:technical board]] has decided to put these funds to use for the following tasks:

1. Starting in July 2022 we have hired a sysadmin on a basis of

   * USD 400 / month .

1. We are still in the process of migrating the nLab installation to a new server. (The server we have been running on -- which had been kindly donated to us -- was sunsetted already $\ 2$ years ago, and we had been urged to migrate already then.) We have meanwhile been offered a new server for free, again (and a million and more thanks are due to the people who make this work), but actually performing the migration to the new server is a non-trivial task. This is now underway in a joint effort of some nLab technical team members and an IT company. The total costs are not in yet but should amount to

   * $\sim$ EUR 4000 .
