\section{Overview}

The physical existence of the [[HomePage|nLab]] is funded by donations (see [below](#Donate)) which are received via a mechanism handled by the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/), with the kind administrative help of [[Brendan Fong]].

The nLab's [[nlabmeta:technical board]] decides about how to use these funds for paying server rent and sysadmin services (see [further below](#Expenditures)).

## Available funds
 {#AvailableFunds}

As of 05 May 2022 the funds available to the nLab due to donations are 

* 7280.59 USD .




## Expenditures
 {#Expenditures}

Since then we have spent:

* 3 $\times$ 400 USD

  on payment of a temporary sysadmin.

* 504 EUR

  paying a software company to help with the server migration.


The full expected cost of (at least) $\sim$ 4000 EUR was saved, since the enlarged [[nlabmeta:technical board|technical team]] kindly took care of the necessary server migration themselves.
