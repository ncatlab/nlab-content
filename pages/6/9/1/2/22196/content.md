\section{Overview}

The physical existence of the [[HomePage|nLab]] is funded by donations (see [below](#Donate)) which are received via a mechanism handled by the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/), with the kind administrative help of [[Brendan Fong]].

The nLab's [[nlabmeta:technical board]] decides about how to use these funds for paying server rent and sysadmin services (see [further below](#Expenditures)).
