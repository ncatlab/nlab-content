\section{Overview}

In 2021, the [[HomePage|nLab]] will move to the cloud. To fund the running of the nLab in the cloud, we have decided to rely upon funding by [donations](#Donate). 

In the autumn of 2020, at the kind initiative of [[Brendan Fong]], the nLab decided to collaborate with the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/) for the practical side of this: the Topos Institute is legally able to handle donations, and the financing of the nLab will be handled by the Topos Institute. The Topos Institute owns the cloud account in which the nLab will be run. 

\section{Plan}

The nLab is carrying out an initial [request for donations](#Donate) to support the running of the nLab, via the Topos Institute. Hopefully, the amounts raised will be sufficient to finance the running of the nLab for a number of years, and no further request for donations for this purpose will be made until necessary. It is possible in the future that funds donated to the nLab may be put to the development of the nLab in other ways, but there are no definite plans for this yet.

\section{A community endeavour}

The details of donations will not be made public. The nLab will view itself as equally indebted to those who contribute a smaller amount as to those who contribute a larger amount. When we work on the nLab, we work for everybody: those who have made a donation, and those who have not.
