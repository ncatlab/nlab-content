Various sets of real or complex-valued functions have not only the structure of vector space but also additional topological structure. To study those systematically various classes of topological vector spaces were gradually developed and studied, often irrespective on the nature of elements. Hence one can study Banach spaces of anything, not necessarily of functions. Naturally more and more general structures were studied. Thus the __functional analysis__ is a field of mathematics studying compatible algebraic and topological structure, where algebraic most often refers to linear spaces with structure (e.g. ordered vector space, real algebra etc.) and topological may include topology but also metric refinements like norm etc. The underlying ground field is most often real or complex numbers. In addition to the study of topological vector spaces, various interesting classes or examples of operators on them are in focus of this subject.

Main classical areas is the subject of topological vector spaces (important classes include Hilbert, Banach, Frechet spaces, and a pretty general class of [[locally convex space|locally convex topological vector spaces]]). The spectral theory, measure theory, ergodic theory and representation theory gave rise to the study of [[operator algebras]], out of which the mainstream variety of the [[noncommutative geometry]] also arose. 

Wikipedia [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis) has a fair list of books on the subject.
