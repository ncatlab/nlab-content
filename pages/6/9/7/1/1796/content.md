## Idea

Due to [[Paul Taylor]], Abstract Stone Duality (ASD) is a re-[[axiom|axiomatisation]] of the notions of *[[topological space]]* and *[[continuous function]]* in [[general topology]] in terms of a [[lambda calculus|lambda-calculus]] of [[computable function|computable]] [[continuous functions]] and [[predicates]].

Abstract Stone duality is both [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] and [[computable mathematics|computable]], thus being one approach to [[synthetic topology]].

The topology on a space is treated not as a discrete [[lattice]], but as an [[exponential object]] of the same [[category]] as the original space, with an associated &#955;-calculus (which includes an [[internalization|internal]] lattice structure). Every expression in the &#955;-calculus denotes both a continuous function and a program. ASD does not use the [[Set|category of sets]] (or any [[topos]]), but the [[full subcategory]] of [[overt space|overt]] [[discrete space|discrete]] objects plays this role (an overt object is the dual to a [[compact space|compact]] object), forming an [[arithmetic universe]] (a [[pretopos]] with [[lists]]) with general [[recursion]]; an optional 'underlying set' axiom (which is not [[predicative mathematics|predicative]]) will make this a topos.

The classical (but not constructive) theory of [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[sober space|sober]] [[topological space]]s is a model of ASD, as is the theory of locally compact [[locale]]s over any topos (even constructively).  In "Beyond Local Compactness" on the ASD website, Taylor removes the restriction of local compactness.
