###### Definition

A [[topological space]] is called _extremally disconnected_ if the [[closure]] of any [[open subset]] is still an open subset, 
or, equivalently, the closures of disjoint open subsets are disjoint.

=--

This is equivalent to [[separation axioms in terms of lifting properties#IllustrationOfLiftingForExtremallyDisconnected|a 
left lifting property with respect to a 
surjective proper morphism of finite topological spaces 
(see details here)]].
We hope the picture of finite topological spaces is mostly self-explanatory: boxes are put around open subsets, and 
an arrow $x\to c$ means that $c$ is in the closure of $x$.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem (Gleason)

Extremally disconnected topological spaces are precisely the [[projective objects]] in the [[category]] of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Hausdorff topological spaces]], and in fact in 
the category of topological spaces and proper maps.

=--

See e.g. ([Bhatt-Scholze 13, below theorem 1.8](BhattScholze13))
For the second part see [Strauss (1967), Theorem].


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $R$ a [[w-contractible ring]], the [[profinite set]] $\pi_0(Spec R)$
is an extremally disconnected [[profinite set]].

Part of ([Bhatt-Scholze 13, theorem 1.8](#BhattScholze13)).

## The logical side

The extremal disconnectedness of a space is correlated with the property that the frame of its open subsets is a [[De Morgan Heyting algebra]] hence with the validity of the [[De Morgan law]] in logic, since a result by Johnstone says that a topos $Sh(X)$ of sheaves on a space $X$ is a [[De Morgan topos]] precisely when $X$ is extremally disconnected and this implies that all subobject lattices $sub(X)$ are De Morgan Heyting algebras, in particular $sub(1)$ corresponding to the frame of opens of $X$ (cf. [[De Morgan topos]] for details and references).

## Weak factorisation systems

Being extremally disconnected is a left lifting property with respect to a surjective proper morphism of finite topological spaces.
Both being surjective and being proper are the right lifting properties. 
Hence, existance of a weak factorisation system generated by this morphism 
implies that each space admits a surjective proper map from an extremally disconnected space. In fact, the statement of the Gleason theorem 
can be understood in terms of weak factorisation systems generated by 
morphisms of finite topological spaces. See a [[separation axioms in terms of lifting properties#DiscussionOfLiftingForExtremallyDisconnected|a discussion here]] for more details.

###### Example

For $S$ any [[set]] regarded as a [[discrete topological space]],
its [[Stone-Cech compactification]] is extremally disconnected.

###### Counter-Example

The [[profinite set]] underlying the [[p-adic integers]], regarded as a [[Stone space]], is _not_ extremally disconnected.
