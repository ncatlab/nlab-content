# Classical Whitehead theorem #

The classical **Whitehead theorem** asserts that

Every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] between [[CW-complex]]es is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

(See also the discussion at [[m-cofibrant space]]).

Using the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem this may be reformulated:

In the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[? Grpd]] every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

# Whitehead theorem in general $(\infty,1)$-toposes #

There is a notion of [[homotopy group]]s for objects in every [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]], as described at [[homotopy group (of an ∞-stack)]]. Accordingly, there is a notion of [[weak homotopy equivalence]] in every [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] and hence an analog of the statement of Whiteheads theorem. One finds that

**Warning** Whitehead's theorem **fails** for general [[(∞,1)-topos]]es.

The [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es in which the Whitehead theorem does hold are the [[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]]es. These are precisely the ones that are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by a local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. 

For instance the hypercomplete $(\infty,1)$-topos [[Top]] is presented by the model structure on simplicial presheaves on the point, namely the [[model structure on simplicial sets]].
