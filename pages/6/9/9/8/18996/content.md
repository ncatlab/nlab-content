###### Definition
**(H-cohomology)**

Given a [[smooth manifold]] or [[formal smooth manifold]] $X$, and given a [[differential 3-form]] $H \in \Omega^3(X)$, then forming the [[wedge product]] with $H$ is a nilpotent operation, and hence defines the [[differential]] of a [[cochain complex]] whose entries are the [[vector spaces]] $\Omega^{even/odd}(X)$ of all odd-graded or all even-graded [[differential forms]] on $X$:

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  \Omega^{even}(X)
    \overset{H\wedge(-)}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega^{odd}(X)
    \overset{H\wedge(-)}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega^{even}(X)
    \overset{H\wedge(-)}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega^{odd}(X)
    \to
   \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[cochain cohomology]] of this [[cochain complex]] 

$$
  H^{even/odd}_{H\wedge}(X)
  \coloneqq; 
  \frac{
    ker
    \left(
      \Omega^{even/odd}(X)
       \overset{H\wedge(-)}{\longrightarrow}
      \Omega^{odd/even}(X)
     \right)
   }{
    im
    \left(
      \Omega^{odd/even}(X)
       \overset{H\wedge(-)}{\longrightarrow}
      \Omega^{even/odd}(X)
     \right)
   }
$$

is also called the _H-cohomology_ of $X$.

###### Remark

Often it is assumed that the 3-form $H$ in def. \ref{HCohomology} is [[closed differential form|closed]], because in this case H-cohomology serves as an approximation to the corresponding $H$-[[twisted de Rham cohomology]] (prop. \ref{TwistedDeRhamCohomologyCoincidesWithHCohomologyOnInfinitesimllayThickenedPoint} below). But of course for def. \ref{HCohomology} to make sense in itself, $H$ need not be closed.

###### Proposition

If the [[de Rham complex]] $(\Omega^\bullet(X),d_{dr})$ is [[formal dg-algebra|formal]], then for $H \in \Omega_{cl}^3(X)$ a [[closed differential form|closed]] [[differential 3-form]], the H-cohomology of $X$ (def. \ref{HCohomology}) coincides with its $H$-[[twisted de Rham cohomology]]:

$$
  H^\bullet_{H \wedge (-)}(X)
  \simeq
  H^\bullet_{d + H \wedge (-)}(X)
  \,.
