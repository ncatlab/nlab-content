# Idea #

A finite dimensional [[Lie algebra]] $g$ or degreewise finite-dimensional [[L-∞ algebra]] $g$ is encoded in a a differential $D : \vee^\bullet g \to \vee^\bullet g$ on the cofree co-commutative coalgebra generated by $g$.

The dual of this is a [[differential graded algebra]] $(\wedge^\bullet g^*, d)$. The underlying [[cochain complex]] (forgetting the [[monoid]]al structure) is the _Chevalley-Eilenberg cochain complex_ .

There is in fact a bijection between [[semifree dga|quasi-free]] [[cochain complex|cochain]] [[differential graded algebra]]s in non-negative degree and [[L-∞ algebra]]s. 

The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex is usually defined a bit more generally for [[Lie algebra]]s equipped with a [[Lie module]] $g \to End V$. In the above language this more general cochain complex is the one underlying the [[Lie ∞-algebroid]] that encodes this action in the sense of [[Lie ∞-algebroid representation]]s.

The [[chain homology and cohomology|cohomology]] of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex is called [[Lie algebra cohomology]].
