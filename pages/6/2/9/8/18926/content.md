## Idea

A _[[Lagrangian field theory]]_ is _interacting_ if it is not a _[[free field theory]]_. Just as in the discussion at _[[free field theory]]_, there is some room for making this precise, but at the very least it should mean that the [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]] are _not [[linear differential equation|linear]]_.

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the [[algebras of observables]] of interacting field theories are [[quantization|quantized]] as [[formal power series]] in [[Planck's constant]] and in the [[coupling constant]] ([[interacting field algebra]]), as a formal expansion around the quantizaton of a [[free field theory]] ([[Wick algebra]]).

To date [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is the only way known to approach the [[quantization]] of [[interacting field theories]] in [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $\geq 4$. In [[constructive field theory]] examples of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] interacting quantum field theores in [[dimension]] 3 have been constructed and examples in dimension 2 are common, such as [[2d CFTs]].  

## Examples

Key examples of interacting field theories are [[phi^4 theory]] ([[scalar field theory]] with [[interaction]] term given by the power $(\mathbf{\Phi}(x))$ of the [[field observable]]), [[Yang-Mills theory]] for [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[gauge group]] and [[gravity]]. 

The [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]], as a [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] is a famous open problem.
Yang-Mills theory with [[abelian group|abelian]] [[gauge group]] the [[circle group]] is a [[free field theory]], but coupled to a [[Dirac field]] there is a canonical [[interaction]] term that makes this the interacting field theory called _[[quantum electrodynamics]]_ (QED).  Similarly [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) is an interacting field theories. These interacting theories (QED, QCD with [[Higgs field]]-coupling) make up the [[standard model of particle physics]].
