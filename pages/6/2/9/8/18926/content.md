## Idea

A _[[Lagrangian field theory]]_ is _interacting_ if it is not a _[[free field theory]]_.

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the [[algebras of observables]] of interacting field theories are [[quantized]] as [[formal power series]] in [[Planck's constant]] and in the [[coupling constant]] ([[interacting field algebra]]), as a formal expansion around the quantizaton of a [[free field theory]] ([[Wick algebra]]).
