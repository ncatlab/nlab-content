## Definition

In a [[†-category]] $C$, a [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ is said to be **unitary** if it is [[isomorphism|invertible]] and its [[inverse]] $f^{-1}$ is its dagger $f^{\dagger}$: 

$$
  f^{-1} = f^\dagger : y \to x
  \,.
$$ 

For more details, see the entry [[†-category]].

## Examples

* The unitary morphisms in $C = $ [[Hilb]] are the ordinary [[unitary operator]]s between [[Hilbert space]]s 

  In particular the unitary [[automorphism]]s of an object in $Hilb$ form the [[unitary group]].
