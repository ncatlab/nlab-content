For $X$ a [[topological space]], let $\Pi(X)_\bullet := X^{\Delta_{Top}^\bullet}$ be the [[simplicial set]] of $n$-[[simplex|simplices]] in $X$ -- the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid]] of $X$.

For $R$ some [[ring]], let $Maps(\Pi(X),R)^{\bullet}$ be the [[simplicial object|simplicial]] [[ring]] of $R$-valued functions on the spaces of $n$-simplices. The corresponding [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex]] $C^\bullet(X)$ is the cochain complex whose [[chain homology and cohomology|cochain cohomology]] is the __singular cohomology__ of the space $X$:

a homogeneous element $\omega_p \in C^p(X)$ is a function on $p$-simplices in $X$.

These form a ring themselves under the [[cup product]].
