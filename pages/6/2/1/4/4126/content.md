## Idea

In [[quantum mechanics]], the _Kochen-Specker theorem_ -- developed in 1967 by [[Simon Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]] -- is a [[no-go theorem]] that places limits on the types of [[hidden variable theories]] that may be used to explain the apparent randomness of quantum mechanics in a causal way.  It is a complement to [[Bell's theorem]], developed by [[John Bell]] in 1964, and is related to [[Gleason's theorem]], developed in 1957 by Andrew Gleason (who incidentally is the person who communicated the original Kochen-Specker paper to the _Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics_ ).
