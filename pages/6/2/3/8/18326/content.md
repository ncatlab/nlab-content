## Definition

A **Freyd category** [Levy 04](#Levy04) may be defined as

* a [[small category]] $\mathbb{V}$ with [[finite products]];
* a small category $\mathbb{C}$;
* an [[action]] of $\mathbb{V}$ on $\mathbb{C}$ (with the finite products providing a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]] for $\mathbb{V}$)
* an identity-on-objects [[functor]] $\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{C}$ that preserves the actions.

## Properties

### Relation to Lawvere theories

[Staton 14](#Staton14) shows that a Freyd category is equivalent to a [[Lawvere theory]] enriched in a locally $\emptyset$-presentable [[cartesian closed category]].
