For $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  the **special unitary group** $SU(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$ which preserve the [[volume form]] on this space.   This group canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices with determinant 1.
