## Idea

In [[string theory]] the term _swampland_ had been introduced ([Vafa 05](#Vafa05)) to publicly highlight the basic fact that many [[effective quantum field theory]] [[vacuum state|vacua]] will not admit a [[UV-completion]] to a [[string theory vacuum]], hence that admitting a completion to a [[string theory vacuum]] is a strong constraint, hence that [[string theory]] predicts many more conditions to be satisfied by [[gauge groups]], [[field (physics)|field content]] and [[coupling constants]] than predicted by plain [[quantum field theory]].

The terminology was motivated since the collection of [[string theory vacua]] had previously come to be called the _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_. The idea is to imagine the remaining [[effective field theory|EFTs]] not "in" this landscape to form a space "away from the landscape", whence the colorful imagery of a swampland.

More in detail, there is supposedly a map

\[
  \label{PointParticleLimitMap}
  \text{String Vacua}
  \overset{\;\;ppl\;\;}{\longrightarrow}
  \text{effective QFT Vacua}
\]

that takes [[string theory vacua]] to their low-energy approximation by [[vacuum state|vacua]] of [[effective quantum field theories]]. One way to possibly formalize this is to take the point-particle limit (ppl) of [[2d SCFTs]] to obtain [[spectral triples]] (as discussed at _[[2-spectral triple]]_) taking [[string]] [[worldsheets]] to [[Feynman diagrams]]:

Then with language of [[homological algebra]] or more generally of [[category theory]] we may begin to formalize the situation as follows:

1. the [[domain]] of (eq:PointParticleLimitMap) is the [[landscape of string theory vacua]];

1. the [[image]] of (eq:PointParticleLimitMap) is the landscape of corresponding [[effective quantum field theories|eQFTs]] that admit stringy [[UV-completion]];

1. the [[cokernel]] of (eq:PointParticleLimitMap) is the _swampland_;

1. the [[kernel]] of (eq:PointParticleLimitMap), or more generally its [[fiber]] over any [[effective quantum field theory|EFT]], is the space of different choices of stringy [[UV-completion]] of the same [[effective quantum field theory]].

Making this fully precise requires saying more about what the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] in (eq:PointParticleLimitMap) actually are, and in which ambient [[category]] (they will be some kind of [[moduli stacks]] in an ambient [[(∞,1)-category]] which may not quite be [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]], whence "[[cokernel]]" may need to be interpreted in a non-abelian sense; but such details don't change the general idea here).

For example, part of what it means to specify a [[string theory vacuum]] is to declare the [[D-brane charge]] contained in this vacuum (subject to [[RR-field tadpole cancellation]] against [[O-plane]]-charges). In actual [[string theory]] this [[RR-field]] [[charge]] is supposed to be (see [there](D-brane#ReferencesKTheoryDescription)) a [[cocycle]] in some flavour of [[topological K-theory]] ([[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]] [[differential K-theory|differential]] [[KR-theory]]), while its image in the underlying [[effective field theory]] is in the corresponding flavour of [[ordinary cohomology]]/[[de Rham cohomology]]. The map that relates the two incarnations of RR-field charge is the _[[Chern character]]_, which is what formalizes the map (eq:PointParticleLimitMap) in in the D-brane charge "sector" of the theory

$$
  \array{
    \text{String Vacua}
    &\overset{\;\;ppl\;\;}{\longrightarrow}&
    \text{effective QFT Vacua}
    \\
    \left\{
    \array{
      \text{D-brane RR-charge}
      \\
      \text{in K-theory}
    }
    \right\}
    &\overset{\text{Chern character}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \left\{
    \array{
      \text{flux forms in}
      \\
      \text{ordinary cohomology}
    }
    \right\}
  }
$$

The [[Chern character]] in general does have non-trivial [[cokernel]] ("swampland RR-fields") and [[kernel]] (choices of [[UV-completion]] of the effective RR-fields). In fact it fits not just in a [[short exact sequence]], but in the [[differential cohomology hexagon]] (see there for more) of [[K-theory]].

In contrast to this example, the literature on the "swampland" phenomenon is currently dominated by informal hand-wavy arguments. Starting with [Ooguri-Vafa 06](#OoguriVafa06) is an attempt to guess semi-precise rules-of-thumb for recognizing [[effective field theory|EFTs]] in the swampland, now known as the _swampland conjectures_. Motivated by the re-opening of the question whether [[de Sitter spacetime]] actually appears in [[string theory vacua]] or not ([Danielsson-van Riet 18](#DanielssonVanRiet18)), these swampland conjecture currently revolve around bounds on the [[cosmological constant]] in relation to [[scalar fields]] in the theory.

An argument that much of the existing swampland literature does not even live up to the level of rigour of [[folklore]] string theory, and in fact that it is fundamentally flawed, is made in [Banks 19](#Banks19).


## Swampland conjectures
 {#SwamplandConjectures}

The following list of statements have come (around 2020-2021) to be widely discussed in a sector of the [[string phenomenology]] community which associates with the "swampland" imagery. They are now commonly referred to and known as  "conjectures", specifically "the swampland conjectures", but the terms used tend to remain vague/undefined and may change their intended meaning with context (not the least the notion of "state in quantum gravity", which however in most of these statements really means: classical solitonic [[black brane]]-solution in some [[supergravity]]-theory -- e.g. in Conj. \ref{ElectricWeakGravityConjecture}). 

But some of these statements have been interpreted in special cases as more precise statements about [[moduli spaces]] of [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]], and in this form they may be closer to [[conjectures]] in the sense of established sense of [[mathematics]].


### No global symmetries conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
A theory coupled to [[gravity]] must have no global symmetries, which means that they are either broken or gauged. 
\end{conjecture}

This includes global $p$-form symmetries as well as global discrete symmetries. 

### Completeness hypothesis

\begin{conjecture}
A [[gauge theory]] coupled to [[gravity]] must contain physical states with all possible gauge charges consistent with [[Dirac charge quantization]].
\end{conjecture}

\begin{remark}
This immediately implies that any continuous [[gauge group]] (i.e. a [[Lie group]]) must be [[compact]].
However, this does not restrict discrete gauge groups, which can be non-compact (e.g. [[duality]] groups).
\end{remark}

### BPS completeness hypothesis

\begin{conjecture}
If a given charge can be populated by [[BPS states]], then the physical spectrum must contain a BPS state with this charge.
\end{conjecture}

### Weak gravity conjecture

#### Electric weak gravity conjecture

\begin{conjecture}\label{ElectricWeakGravityConjecture}
Given a $U(1)$-[[gauge theory]] weakly coupled to [[gravity]] with [[gauge coupling]] $g$, there must exist an electrically charged state with mass $m$ and charge $q$ satisfying

$$ m \leq \sqrt{2} g q M_p, $$

where $M_p$ is the [[Planck mass]].
\end{conjecture}

The electric weak gravity conjecture can be also formulated by stating that there must exist an electrically charged state satisfying 

$$ \frac{Q}{m} \leq \frac{Q_{\mathrm{ext}}}{M_{\mathrm{ext}}} $$

where $Q=q g$ is the non-quantized charge, $Q_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{ext}}$ are charge and mass of an [[extremal black hole]].

#### Magnetic weak gravity conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
Given a $U(1)$-[[gauge theory]] weakly coupled to [[gravity]] with [[gauge coupling]] $g$, The cutoff scale $\Lambda$ of the [[effective field theory]] must be bounded from above by the [[gauge coupling]] as

$$ \Lambda \leq g M_p^{(d-2)/2}, $$

where $M_p$ is the [[Planck mass]] and $d$ is the [[dimension]].
\end{conjecture}

#### Convex hull weak gravity conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
Given a $U(1)^n$-[[gauge theory]] weakly coupled to [[gravity]], let $\vec{z}_i:=\vec{q}_i/m \in\mathbb{R}^n$ be the charge to mass ratio of a charged state $i$ and let $I$ be the set of charged states in the theory. Then, the [[convex hull|convex set]] of the set $\{\pm\vec{z}_i\}_{i\in\I}$ must contain the unit ball as measured by the kinetic matrix of the $U(1)^n$-[[gauge theory]].
\end{conjecture}

This condition is a stronger statement than requiring the weak gravity conjecture to be satised for each $U(1)$-[[gauge theory]].

#### Sublattice (or tower) weak gravity conjecture

(...)

### Swampland distance conjecture

\begin{terminology}
Consider the [[moduli space]] $\mathcal{M}$ of a theory coupled to [[gravity]], which is parametrized by the expectation values of some field $\phi^i$ that has no [[potential]]. Starting from any point $P \in \mathcal{M}$ there always exists another point $Q \in \mathcal{M}$ such that their [[geodesic distance]] $d(P,Q)$ is infinite. This is called *infinite field distance limit*.
\end{terminology}

\begin{example}
The decompactification limit in compactified [[string theory]] is the standard example of infinite field distance limit.
\end{example}

\begin{conjecture}
There exists an infinite tower of states with a mass scale $M$ that becomes exponentially light at any infinite field distance limit as

$$ M(Q) \sim M(P)e^{-c d(P,Q)}, $$

where $c$ is a positive constant.
\end{conjecture}

### Emergent string conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
Any infinite field distance limit is either 
 
* a decompactification limit, or

* a limit in which a weakly coupled string becomes tensionless.

\end{conjecture}

This is a refinement of the *swampland distance conjecture* which explicits the nature of the tower of states.

### AdS distance conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
Any [[AdS]] [[vacuum]] has an infinite tower of states that becomes light in the flat spacetime limit $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$, satisfying

$$ m\sim|\Lambda|^c, $$

where $c$ is a constant.
\end{conjecture}

### AdS instability conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
Any [[non-supersymmetric vacuum]] is at best metastable (and eventually has to decay).
\end{conjecture}

### dS conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
The scalar [[potential]] $V$ of an [[effective field theory]] weakly coupled to gravity must satisfy the following bound on its derivatives:

$$ |\nabla V| \geq \frac{c}{M_p}V, $$

where $c\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ is positive.
\end{conjecture}

The dS conjecture was further refined as it follows.

\begin{conjecture}
The previous bound needs to be imposed only if the condition 
$$ \mathrm{min}(\nabla_i\nabla_j V) \leq -\frac{c'}{M_p^2}V, $$
for some $c'\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, on the second derivative of the [[potential]] is violated.
\end{conjecture}

Thanks to this refinement, only proper dS minima are excluded and not general critical points.

### Trans-planckian censorship conjecture

(...)

### Asymptotic dS conjecture

\begin{conjecture}
The scalar [[potential]] $V$ of an [[effective field theory]] weakly coupled to [[gravity]] presents a _runaway behavior_ when approaching an infinite field distance point, i.e.

$$ |\nabla V| \geq c V, $$

where $c\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$.
\end{conjecture}

This is an asymptotic version of the *dS conjecture*.

### Swampland cobordism conjecture
 {#SwamplandCobordismConjecture}

From [McNama & Vafa 17](#McNamaVafa17):

\begin{conjecture}\label{OriginalSwamplandCobordismConjecture}
For any [[quantum gravity]] theory [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on a $d$-dimensional internal manifold, some kind of "quantum-gravity version" of a [[cobordism group]] must vanish in degree $d$. In heuristic symbols:

$$ \Omega^{\mathrm{QG}}_d = 0. $$
\end{conjecture}

\begin{remark}
A rigorous discussion of a possible role of [[cobordism cohomology]] in [[M-theory]], assuming [[Hypothesis H]], is in [Sati & Schreiber 21a](#SatiSchreiber21a); for relation to discussion of Conj. \ref{OriginalSwamplandCobordismConjecture} see [p. 83](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01877.pdf#page=83) there.
\end{remark}
