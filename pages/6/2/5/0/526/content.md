A **comonoid** in a [[monoidal category]] $M$ is a [[monoid]] [[internalization|in]] the monoidal category $M^{op}$.

For example, a comonoid in [[Vect]] is called a [[coalgebra]].  Every set can be made into a comonoid in [[Set]] in a unique way.  More generally, every object in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] can be made into a comonoid in a unique way.
