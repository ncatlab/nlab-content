A **comonoid** (or __comonoid object__) in a [[monoidal category]] $M$ is a [[monoid object]] in the [[opposite category]] $M^{op}$ (which is a monoidal category using the same operation as in $M$).

For example, a comonoid in [[Vect]] (with its usual [[tensor product]]) is called a [[coalgebra]].  Every set can be made into a comonoid in [[Set]] (with the [[cartesian product]]) in a unique way.  More generally, every object in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] can be made into a comonoid in a unique way.
