## Idea

In the context of [[Goodwillie calculus]] the _Taylor tower_ of an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F$ to a [[Goodwillie-differentiable (∞,1)-category]] is its stagewise approximation by [[n-excisive (∞,1)-functors]] $P_n F$ (its [n-excisive projections](n-excisive+%28?%2C1%29-functor#nExcisiveApproximation))

$$
  \cdots \to P_{n+1} F \to P_n F \to \cdots \to P_1 F \to P_0 F
  \,.
$$

which is [[analogy|analogous]] to the approximation of a [[smooth function]] by its [[Taylor series]].

If this tower converges to $F$, then $F$ is analogous to an [[analytic function]] and is called an _[[analytic (∞,1)-functor]]_.

The [[spectral sequence]] induced by the [[filtration]] given by the Goodwillie-Taylor tower is the _[[Goodwillie spectral sequence]]_.

## Properties

### Convergence

convergence for $\rho$-[[analytic (∞,1)-functors]] on $\rho$-[[n-connected object of an (infinity,1)-topos|connective objects]] (...) ([Goodwillie 03, theorem 1.13](#Goodwillie03), see also [Munson-Volic 15, theorem 10.1.51 and section 10.2.4](#MunsonVolic15))
