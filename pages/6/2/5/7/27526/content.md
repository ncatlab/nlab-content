## Selected writings

On the first of [[William Lawvere]]'s *[[Open problems in topos theory]]*, the existence of a [[proper class]] of quotient toposes of a [[Grothendieck topos]] (with 'quotient maps' defined to be '[[connected topos#connected_geometric_morphism|connected]] [[geometric morphism#surjections_and_embeddings|surjective geometric morphisms]]'):

Solution for the case of [[Boolean toposes]]:

* {#Hora23} [[Ryuya Hora]]: *Internal Parameterization of Hyperconnected Quotients* &lbrack;[arXiv:2302.06851](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06851)&rbrack;

  talk at *[[Category Theory conference]]* (July 2023) &lbrack;[pdf](https://sites.uclouvain.be/ct2023/supports/4_THURSDAY/Hora.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVvTIe-lHXw)&rbrack;

A special example in the non-Boolean case:

* {#HoraKamio23} [[Ryuya Hora]], Yuhi Kamio: *Quotient toposes of discrete dynamical systems*, Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra **228** 8 (2024) 107657 &lbrack;[doi;10.1016/j.jpaa.2024.107657](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpaa.2024.107657), [arXiv:2310.02647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02647)&rbrack;

On [Lawvere's fourth problem in topos theory](William+Lawvere#FirstProblemInToposTheory), to calculate the [[Aufhebung]] of the [[adjoint triple|opposition]] between [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]] and [[simplicial coskeleton|coskeleta]] in the category of [[symmetric simplicial sets]] (the [[category of presheaves]] on the category of [[inhabited set|non-empty]] [[finite sets]]):

On [[adjoint strings]] of [[functors]] between a [[topos]] and [[Set]] and specifically on *completely connected* toposes ([[locally connected toposes]] with a further [[left adjoint]] to the left adjoint to the [[inverse image]] functor):

* [[Ryuya Hora]]: _Grothendieck topos with a left adjoint to a left adjoint to a left adjoint to the global sections functor_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2503.04317](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04317)&rbrack;
