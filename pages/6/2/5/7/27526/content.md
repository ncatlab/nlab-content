## Selected writings

On [Lawvere's first problem in topos theory](William+Lawvere#FirstProblemInToposTheory), the existence of a [[proper class]] of quotient toposes of a [[Grothendieck topos]] (with 'quotient maps' defined to be '[[connected topos#connected_geometric_morphism|connected]] [[geometric morphism#surjections_and_embeddings|surjective geometric morphisms]]'):

Solution for the case of [[Boolean toposes]]:

* [[Ryuya Hora]]: *Internal Parameterization of Hyperconnected Quotients* &lbrack;[arXiv:2302.06851](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06851)&rbrack;

A special example in the non-Boolean case:

* [[Ryuya Hora]], Yuhi Kamio: _Quotient toposes of discrete dynamical systems_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2310.02647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02647)&rbrack;

Full solution:

* Yuhi Kamio, [[Ryuya Hora]], _A solution to the first Lawvere's problem A Grothendieck topos that has a proper class many quotient topoi_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2407.17105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17105)&rbrack;

On [Lawvere's fourth problem in topos theory](William+Lawvere#FirstProblemInToposTheory), to calculate the [[Aufhebung]] of the [[adjoint triple|opposition]] between [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]] and [[simplicial coskeleton|coskeleta]] in the category of [[symmetric simplicial sets]] (the [[category of presheaves]] on the category of [[inhabited set|non-empty]] [[finite sets]]):

* [[Ryuya Hora]], Yuki Maehara: _Lawvere's fourth open problem: Levels in the topos of symmetric simplicial sets_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2503.03439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03439)&rbrack;


On [[adjoint strings]] of [[functors]] between a [[topos]] and [[Set]] and specifically on *completely connected* toposes ([[locally connected toposes]] with a further [[left adjoint]] to the left adjoint to the [[inverse image]] functor):

* [[Ryuya Hora]]: _Grothendieck topos with a left adjoint to a left adjoint to a left adjoint to the global sections functor_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2503.04317](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04317)&rbrack;
