is a description of how (in Taylor\'s opinion) the [[foundations]] of mathematics should really be done, with an eye towards matching how mathematics is done in practice (with the consequence that the system is no stronger than necessary).

The result is actually a series of foundations, most [[constructive mathematics|constructive]], suitable for different sorts of mathematics.  Ultimately, these are described as [[internal logic|logic in]] categories defined by [[sketch]]es and equipped with distinguished [[pullback]]-stable classes of _display morphisms_.

The book includes a self-contained, though dense, introduction to [[category theory]]. Before the three chapters on category theory comes a chapter "Posets and Lattices", which "does for posets everything that is later done for categories" (per Taylor's [summary](http://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/summary.html)); compare [[category theory vs order theory]].


## Resources

The text is [available online](http://www.PaulTaylor.EU/Practical-Foundations/index.html) in a somewhat unreadable format.

There is also a [summary](http://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/summary.html) in a readable format. This is basically an expanded table of contents together with an abbreviated introduction, with a link into the above-mentioned online text for each section.

A useful survey of some of the topics discussed there is also in

* [[Paul Taylor]], _Foundations for computable topology_ ([web](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/foufct/abstract.html))
 {#topology}

which is an exposition of Taylor's [[Abstract Stone Duality]].
