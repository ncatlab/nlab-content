Paul Taylor\'s book _Practical Foundations of Mathematics_ is a description of how (in Taylor\'s opinion) the [[foundations]] of mathematics should really be done, with an eye towards matching how mathematics is done in practice (with the consequence that the system is no stronger than necessary).

The result is actually a series of foundations, most [[constructivism|constructive]], suitable for different sorts of mathematics.  Ultimately, these are described as [[internal logic|logic in]] categories defined by [[sketch]]es and equipped with distinguished [[pullback]]-stable classes of _display morphisms_.

It is [available online](http://www.PaulTaylor.EU/Practical-Foundations/index.html) in a somewhat unreadable format.
