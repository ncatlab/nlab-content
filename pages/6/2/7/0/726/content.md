  [online version](http://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/index.html)

on a formulation of the [[foundations of mathematics]], with an eye towards the actual practice of [[mathematics]] (with the consequence that the system is no stronger than necessary).

The result is actually a series of foundations, most [[constructive mathematics|constructive]], suitable for different sorts of mathematics.  Ultimately, these are described as [[internal logic|logic in]] categories defined by [[sketch]]es and equipped with distinguished [[pullback]]-stable classes of _display morphisms_.

The book includes a self-contained, though dense, introduction to [[category theory]]. Before the three chapters on category theory comes a chapter "Posets and Lattices", which "does for posets everything that is later done for categories" (per Taylor's [summary](http://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/summary.html)); compare [[category theory vs order theory]].


## Resources

The text is [available online](http://www.PaulTaylor.EU/Practical-Foundations/index.html) in a somewhat unreadable format.

There is also a [summary](http://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/summary.html) in a readable format. This is basically an expanded table of contents together with an abbreviated introduction, with a link into the above-mentioned online text for each section.

A useful survey of some of the topics discussed there is also in

* [[Paul Taylor]], _Foundations for computable topology_ ([web](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/foufct/abstract.html))
 {#topology}

which is an exposition of Taylor's [[Abstract Stone Duality]].
