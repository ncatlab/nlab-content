## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] one speaks of the "statistics" of a [[particle]] species or other object when referring to the [[irreducible representation]] of the [[group]] which exchanges identical such particles that it belongs to. Typically this is the [[symmetric group]] and accordingly one speaks of [[boson]] and [[fermion]] statistics. But in special cases, namely whenever the codimension in space of the objects in question is 1 (e.g. point particles in 2-dimensional [[quantum field theories]]), accordingly in this situation these may have what is then called _braid group statistics_ and one speaks of _[[anyons]]_.
