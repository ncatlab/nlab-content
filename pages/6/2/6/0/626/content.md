_String diagrams_ are a graphical calculus for expressing operations in a [[monoidal category]]. The idea is roughly to think of morphisms in a monoidal category as "strings" which run from their source objects to their target objects and to encode further structure on the monoidal category in geometrical properties on these strings. For instance

* having no string at all denotes the tensor unit;

* putting strings next to each other denotes the [[tensor product]];

* braiding strings over each other corresponds to -- yes, the [[braided monoidal category|braiding]] (if any);

* bending strings around corresponds to dualities on the corresponding [[dualizable object]] (if any).

There are many additional structures on monoidal categories (see the article by Selinger below for an overview) which encode further geometric properties. For instance

* in monoidal categories which are _ribbon categories_ the strings from above behave as if they have a small transversal extension which makes them behave as ribbons. Accordingly, there is a _twist_ operation in the axioms of a ribbon category and graphically it corresponds to twisting the ribbons by 180 degrees.

* in monoidal categories which are _spherical_ all strings behave as if drawn on a sphere.

* etc.

Many operations in monoidal categories that look rather unenlightening in symbols become very obvious in string diagram calculus, such as the [[trace]]: an output wire gets bent around and connects to an input.

##String diagrams for bicategories

Since a monoidal category is just a special case (namely the one-object case) of a [[bicategory]], there is also a string diagram calculus for bicategories. This makes it manifest that the string diagram notation is _Poincar&#233; dual_ to the [[globe|globular]] notation: where one uses $d$-dimensional symbolds the other uses $(2-d)$-dimensional symbols.
