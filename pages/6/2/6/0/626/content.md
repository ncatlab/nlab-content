_String diagrams_ are a graphical calculus for expressing operations in a [[monoidal category]]. The idea is roughly to think of objects in a monoidal category as "strings" and a morphism from one tensor product to another as a node which the source strings enter and the target strings exit. Further structure on the monoidal category is encoded in geometrical properties on these strings. For instance

* putting strings next to each other denotes the monoidal product, and having no string at all denotes the unit;

* braiding strings over each other corresponds to &#8211; yes, the [[braided monoidal category|braiding]] (if any);

* bending strings around corresponds to dualities on [[dualizable object]]s (if any).

There are many additional structures on monoidal categories (see the article by Selinger below for an overview) which encode further geometric properties. For instance

* in monoidal categories which are _[[ribbon category|ribbon categories]]_ the strings from above behave as if they have a small transversal extension which makes them behave as ribbons. Accordingly, there is a _twist_ operation in the axioms of a ribbon category and graphically it corresponds to twisting the ribbons by 180 degrees.

* in monoidal categories which are _[[spherical category|spherical]]_ all strings behave as if drawn on a sphere.

* etc.

Many operations in monoidal categories that look rather unenlightening in symbols become very obvious in string diagram calculus, such as the [[trace]]: an output wire gets bent around and connects to an input.

##String diagrams for bicategories

Since a monoidal category is just a special case (namely the one-object case) of a [[bicategory]], there is also a string diagram calculus for bicategories. This makes it manifest that the string diagram notation is _Poincar&#233; dual_ to the [[globe|globular]] notation: where one uses $d$-dimensional symbolds the other uses $(2-d)$-dimensional symbols.
