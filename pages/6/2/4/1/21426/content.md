## Idea

An _exotic meson_ is a [[hadron]] of [[baryon number]] [[zero]] which however, in contrast to actual [[mesons]], has [[Wigner classification]] given by an [[isospin]] and [[Lorentz group|Lorentz]]-[[spin group]]   [[linear representation|representation]] which is _not_ a [[direct summand]] of a [[tensor product of representations]] of that of a [[quark]]-[[pair]].

Hence the existence of exotic mesons is not readily explained by the [[QCD]]-based [[constituent quark model]] of [[quantum hadrodynamics]],  where [[mesons]] are [[bound states]] of two quarks (and [[baryons]] of three).

Some exotic mesons may possibly be interpreted as [[tetraquarks]] 

## Examples

* [[XYZ mesons]]
