## Definition

A _Riemannian manifold_ is a [[smooth manifold]] equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]].

See also [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]

## Remarks

* To be distinguished from [[Riemann surface]]. In particular, the concepts of 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are, while closely related, crucially different.

* There is a refinement of topological [[cobordism category|cobordism categories]] to one of [[Riemannian cobordism]]s.

* See also the [[Myers–Steenrod theorem]].
