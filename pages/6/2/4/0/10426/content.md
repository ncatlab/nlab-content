## Idea

As the [[type theory]] of [[sheaf toposes]] (under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]]) is _[[geometric type theory]]_, so the [[homotopy type theory]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]] deserves to be called _geometric homotopy type theory_.

In terms of [[axioms]] a geometric homotopy type theory should be something like

* plain [[homotopy type theory]] (i.e. [[dependent type theory]] with [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[identity types]])

* with "all" [[higher inductive types]]

* with the [[univalence axiom]]

* and maybe with a "small type of generators" in some sense.
