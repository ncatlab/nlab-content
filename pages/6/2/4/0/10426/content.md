## Idea

In the sense of [[functorial geometry]] one may understand any  [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-topos]] as a [[homotopy theory]] of generalized [[geometry|geometric]] [[spaces]], and hence as a *geometric homotopy theory*.

\begin{tikzcd}[
    column sep=-50pt
  ]
    \mbox{geometry} 
    \ar[dr, hook]
    && 
    \mbox{homotopy theory}
    \ar[dl, hook']
    \\
    &
   \mbox{$(\infty,1)$-topos theory}
\end{tikzcd}

Similarly, as *[[geometric type theory]]* refers to a conjectural [[conservative extension|extension]] of [[geometric logic]] to an [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]] with [[categorical semantics]] in [[sheaf toposes]] (under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]]) equipped with [[geometric morphisms]] between them, a similar conjectural extension to a [[homotopy type theory]] corresponding to [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (and geometric morphisms between them) may deserve to be called _geometric homotopy type theory_ (cf. *[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]*).

Since [[homotopy colimits]] are [[preserved colimit|preserved]] by [[inverse images]] of [[geometric morphisms]], this type theory is likely to include at least non-recursive [[higher inductive types]], and furthermore perhaps free models for every (finite) [[essentially algebraic (infinity,1)-theory]].  (Arbitrary recursive higher inductive types only make sense with reference to [[Pi-types]], which are not geometric.)

Traditionally the [[types]] in geometric homotopy type theory, hence the _geometric homotopy types_, are known as _[[∞-stacks]]_ and maybe better as _[[(∞,1)-sheaves]]_, notably as _[[moduli ∞-stacks]]_.
