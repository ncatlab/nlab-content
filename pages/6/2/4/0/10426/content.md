## Idea

As the [[type theory]] of [[sheaf toposes]] (under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]]) is _[[geometric type theory]]_, so the [[homotopy type theory]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]] maybe deserves to be called _geometric homotopy type theory_. 

Traditionally the [[types]] in geometric homotopy type theory, hence the _geometric homotopy types_, are known as _[[∞-stacks]]_ and maybe better as _[[(∞,1)-sheaves]]_, notably as _[[moduli ∞-stacks]]_.
