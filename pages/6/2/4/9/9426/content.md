## Idea

The _Fermat curve_ is a projective [[algebraic curve]] over a [[ground field]] $k$ given by the Fermat equation 

$$
  x^n + y^n = z^n
  \,,
$$ 

where $n$ is a positive [[integer]] greater or equal $2$. 

_Fermat's last theorem_ is the statement, that for $n\gt 2$ this equation has no solutions in rationals (or, equivalently, has no solutions in integers), other than when at least one of $x,y$ or $z$ vanishes. In other words, the Fermat curves with $n\gt 2$ have no nontrivial $\mathbb{Q}$-[[rational points]]. For $n=2$, the Fermat curve is just the [[projective line]] $\mathbb{P}^1$, hence is much less interesting.

Famously a [[proof]] of this theorem had been announced by [[Pierre de Fermat]], but no proof was recorded before [[Andrew Wiles]] with aid of [[Richard Taylor]] proved the [[modularity theorem]] for semistable [[elliptic curves]], which by [[Ribet's theorem]] implies Fermat's last theorem (see [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem]]).

Therefore, while Fermat's theorem is generally accepted as proven now, the methods used in the proof go far beyond the mathematics known at [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s time. Moreover [[Ribet's theorem]] and the [[modularity theorem]] are major conceptual statements in [[arithmetic geometry]], quite different in character from the content of Fermat's last theorem in itself:

> I confess that Fermat's Last Theorem, as an isolated proposition, has very little interest for me, because I could easily lay down a multitude of such propositions, which one could neither prove nor dispose of. ([[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], quoted in J. R. Newman (ed.) _The World of Mathematics_ (1956))

It is open whether there exists a more direct proof, in particular a proof using only some system of arithmetic. Harvey Friedman has gone so far as to conjecture (his 'Grand Conjecture') that [[Elementary Function Arithmetic]] should be enough to prove FLT, among many other 'finitary' major theorems in mathematics).
