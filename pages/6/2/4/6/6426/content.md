## Idea

A [[super-unitary representation]] of the [[super Poincaré group]] ([[supersymmetry]])

The analog in [[superalgebra]]/[[supergeometry]] of a [[unitary representation of the Poincaré group]].

An [[irreducible representation]] of the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] is called  a **[[super multiplet]]**. This is in general itself a [[super vector space]] which contains an ordinary irreducible [[unitary representation of the Poincaré group]]. Via the [[Wigner classification]] of fundamental [[particles]] with Poincar&#233; irreps, this may be identified with a [[boson|bosonic]] [[relativistic particle]] of some [[mass]] -- together with the images of these "bosonic" elements under the odd generators: the **superpartners** of the bosonic particles.
