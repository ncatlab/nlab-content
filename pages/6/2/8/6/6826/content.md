## Idea

Theories of [[supergravity]] in [[dimension]] $l \lt 11$ always contain a global [[symmetry]] called [[R-symmetry]] (a remnant of the full [[11-dimensional supergravity]] $Spin(10,1)$-symmetry after  [[KK-compactification]]). In some cases this is promoted to a local symmetry, such that there is a [[gauge field]] ([[connection on a bundle]]) with coefficients in that group. These are called _gauged supergravity_ theories. 

## Properties

### From dimensional reduction

For many cases gauged supergravity theories are obtained by [[KK-compactification|dimensional reduction]] from [[11-dimensional supergravity]] or [[type II supergravity]], which themselves do not contain a gauge field but higher degree fields ("fluxes"), the [[supergravity C-field]] and the [[B-field]] respectively. These induce gauged supergravities (e.g. [Samtleben 08, figure 1](#Samtleben08)). The [[gauge groups]] are the [[U-duality]] groups of the compactification (e.g. [Samtleben 08, table 1](#Samtleben08)).
