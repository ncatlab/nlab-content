#Definition#

_Oidification_ is another term for [[horizontal categorification]].

#Remark#

It has rightly been remarked that groupoids are more fundamental than groups, algebroids are more fundamental than algebras, etc. Hence in a better world, the suffix would be characterizing the one-object special cases, not the general concepts.
