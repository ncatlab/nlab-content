The __one-point compactification__ of a [[topological space]] is also known as the __Alexandroff compactification__ or __Alexandroff extension__ after a 1924 paper by [[Pavel Aleksandrov|Павел Сергеевич Александров]] (then transliterated 'P.S. Aleksandroff').

We may start with any [[topological space]] $X$, then construct a [[compact space]] $X^*$, an [[element]] $\infty$ of $X$, and an [[open map|open]] [[embedding]] $X \hookrightarrow X^*$, such that $X^* \setminus \{\infty\} = X$.  This is [[the|essentially unique]].

$X^*$ is technically a [[compactification]] of $X$ (meaning that $X$ is [[dense subspace|dense]] in $X^*$) only if $X$ was not already compact.  $X^*$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (hence a [[compactum]]) if and only if $X$ was already both Hausdorff and [[locally compact space|locally compact]].

The topology on $X^*$ is fairly straightforward: it is generated by the open subsets of $X$ and by the complements of the closed compact subsets of $X$.  (The former are the open subsets of $X^*$ that do not contain $\infty$, while the latter are the open subsets of $X^*$ that do contain $\infty$.)
