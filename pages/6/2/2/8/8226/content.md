## Idea

Every closed [[3-manifold]] can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure
(...)

The proof of the geometrization conjecture implies that of 

* the [[Poincar√© conjecture]]

* the [[elliptization conjecture]]

The conjecture was stated by [[William Thurston]] in 1982. 
The [[Ricci flow]]-strategy for the proof was devised by [[Richard Hamilton]] and the remaining technical problem of controlling the pinching was finally solved by [[Grigori Perelman]].
