## Definition

For $k$ a [[field]] or a [[division ring]], a __vector space__ over $k$ 
(or a $k$-vector space) is a [[module]] over the [[ring]] $k$.  When the vector space is fixed, its elements are called _vectors_, the field $k$ is referred to as the base field of the ground field of the vector space, and the elements of $k$ are called _scalars_. 

Sometimes a vector space over $k$ is called a __$k$-linear space__.  (Compare '$k$-[[linear map]]'.) If $k$ is only a division ring then we
carefully distinguish the left $k$-vector spaces and right $k$-vector spaces.

The [[category]] of vector spaces is typically denoted [[Vect]], or 
$Vect_k$ if we wish to make the field $k$ (the *ground field*) explicit. So

$$
  Vect_k \coloneqq k Mod
  \,.
$$

This category has vector spaces over $k$ as objects, and $k$-linear maps between these as morphisms.

### Multisorted notion 

Alternatively, one sometimes defines "vector space" as a two-sorted notion; taking the field $k$ as one of the sorts and a module over $k$ as the other. More generally, the notion of "module" can also be considered as two-sorted, involving a ring and a module over that ring. 

This is occasionally convenient; for example, one may define the notion of [[topological vector space]] or topological module as an [[internalization]] in $Top$ of the multisorted notion. This procedure is entirely straightforward for topological modules, as the notion of module can be given by a two-sorted Lawvere theory $T$, whence a topological module (for instance) is just a product-preserving functor $T \to Top$. One may then define a topological vector space as a topological module whose underlying (discretized) ring sort is a field. 


## Properties

By the _[[basis theorem]]_ (and using the [[axiom of choice]]) every vector space admits a [[basis of a vector space|basis]].

## Literature

The vector spaces seem to have been first introduced in

* Giuseppe Peano, _Calcolo Geometrico secondo l'Ausdehnungslehre di H. Grassmann preceduto dalle Operazioni della Logica Deduttiva_, Torino 1888

The literature on vector spaces is now extremely large, including lots of elementary linear algebra textbooks. Classics include

* [[Michael Artin]], Algebra
* Israel M. Gelfand, Lectures on linear algebra
* P. R. Halmos, Finite dimensional vector spaces
* [[M M Postnikov]], Lectures on geometry, semester 2: Linear algebra

Affine spaces are sets which are torsors over the abelian group of vectors of a vector space. Thus vector spaces may serve as a basis for the affine and for the Euclidean geometry. This approach has been invented by [[Hermann Weyl]] in 1918. Dieudonn√© wrote an influential book on such an approach to 2d and 3d Euclidian geometry, in which the basics of vector spaces in low dimension is introduced along the way (the book is intended for high school teachers):
