Is there a nice _arrow theoretic_ way to define vector spaces?

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: There is comparatively nice abstract nonsense to be said about _rings_. For instance, a [[ring]] is a category with one object [[internalization|internal to]] the category of abelian groups. From that starting point the concepts of ring theory develop rather naturally from pure category theoretic reasoning. In particular modules over rings appear naturally.

For some reason this is different when rings are refined to _fields_ and modules to vector spaces. The very concept of a _field_ is somehow not as natural from a category theoretic perspective, or at least I don't see how it is. This problem becomes very manifest when one tries to categorigfy fields and vector spaces: it is very straightforward to categorify rings and their modules, but their refinement to categorified fields  and vector spaces is harder.
