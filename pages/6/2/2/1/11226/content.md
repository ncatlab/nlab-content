## Idea

**Computational complexity theory** is the study of how much and how many resources are required to perform [[computations]]. Unlike other systems theories, computational complexity theory is purely mathematical and focuses on analysis of [[formal logic]] and abstract machines.

### History

Historically, computational complexity theory arose from questions in [[computability theory]] and [[cryptography]]. In computability theory, we wanted to know what might be uncomputable relative to certain models of computation. In [[cryptography]], we wanted to know which ciphers could be broken for a given amount of computational resources.

### Current Directions

Today, the main focus of computational complexity theory is analysis of the [[complexity class|complexity classes]] [[P]] and [[NP]]. Their relationship determines which of [[Impagliazzo's five worlds]] is physical reality.

Additionally, [[descriptive complexity]] theory is an active research programme which characterizes complexity classes via formal logic rather than abstract machines.
