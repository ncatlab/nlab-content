## Idea

**Computational complexity theory** is the study of how much and how many resources are required to perform computations. Unlike other systems theories, computational complexity theory is purely mathematical and focuses on analysis of formal logic and abstract machines.

### History

Historically, computational complexity theory arose from questions in [[computability theory]] and [[cryptography]]. In computability theory, we wanted to know what might be uncomputable relative to certain models of computation. In cryptography, we wanted to know which ciphers could be broken for a given amount of computational resources.

### Current Directions

Today, the main focus of computational complexity theory is analysis of the [[complexity class|complexity classes]] P and NP. Their relationship determines which of [[Impagliazzo's five worlds]] is physical reality.

Additionally, [[descriptive complexity]] theory is an active research programme which characterizes complexity classes via formal logic rather than abstract machines.
