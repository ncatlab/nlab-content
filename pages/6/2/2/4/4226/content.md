## Idea

__Motivic integration__ attaches to certain subsets of [[arc scheme]]s of varieties an element in a [[Grothendieck ring of varieties]] in a manner close in spirit to [[Euler characteristics]]. Technically it may be viewed as one of generalizations of [[p-adic integration]] to a geometric integration theory obtained by replacing the [[p-adic integers]] by a more broad class of rings. Some examples include [[formal power series ring]] over the [[complex numbers]], and more generally any henselian discretely valued fields of residual characteristic zero. [Recently](#References), these cases have been generalized to the case of any complete [[discrete valuation ring]] (whose [[residue field]] is [[perfect field|perfect]] in the [[mixed characteristic]] case).

In all of the described cases, the idea is to construct a suitable [[scheme]] over the residue field, called the [[arc space|arc scheme]] which serves as a suitable [[measure space]] on which functions are integrated; however, the value of integrals are not [[real number|real numbers]], but instead they are valued in the [[Grothendieck ring]] of varieties. In this sense, the value of a "motivic" integral is often regarded as a _geometric object_, rather than a numerical value.

The notion of arc scheme has a further generalization, known as a [[Greenberg scheme]].

## History

Motivic integration was introduced in the talk of [[Maxim Kontsevich]] at Orsay in 1995 in order to prove that [[Hodge numbers]] of [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] are [[birational map|birational]] invariants. This talk also dealt with [[orbifold cohomology]] as well as 2 related papers of  [[Lev Borisov]]. The orbifold cohomology has been continued by Weimin Chen, [[Yongbin Ruan]] and collaborators, and later also by algebraic geometers Abramovich, Vistoli, and others. Batyrev is another contributor to both subjects in the context of physics.

Later, a more general framework of motivic integration in model theory has been put forward by Denef and Loeser, partly based on Denef's work on $p$-adic integration. More recent work using a model-theoretic approach is by Hrushovski and Kazhdan.
