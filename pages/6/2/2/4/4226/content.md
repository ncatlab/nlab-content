## History

Motivic integration has been introduced in the talk of Maxim Kontsevich at Orsay in 1996. This talk also dealt with [[orbifold cohomology]] as well as this 2 related papers to [[Lev Borisov]]. The orbifold cohomology has been continued by Weimin Chen, Yongbin Ruan and collaborators, and later also by algebraic geometers Abramovich, Vistoli, and others. From physical side a pioneer of both subjects is also Batyrev. More general framework of motivic integration in model theory has been put forward by Denef and Loeser. More recent work using model theoretica approach is by Hrushovski and Kazhdan.
