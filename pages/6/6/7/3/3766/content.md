## Overview

Liouville [[integrable systems]] can always be phrased in the form of a Lax pair depending on a spectral parameter belonging to so called spectral curve. This way the complex analytic theory of Riemann surfaces comes into play. In a landmark article in 1987, [[Nigel Hitchin]] introduced more refined viewpoint to a rather general class of integrable systems, where the spectral curve is a hyperelliptic curve (genus 2 or more). This system is defined on the cotangent bundle of moduli space of stable bundles studied by Ramanan, Narasimhan, Hitchin, Nitsure, Faltings, [[Carlos Simpson|Simpson]] (introduction of Higgs bundles!) and others. 

The elliptic Calogero-Moser system is an example of Hitchin system. 

For other purposes than integrable systems, e.g. in representation theory, one can consider Hitchin fibration over other ground fields. [[Alexander Beilinson]] and [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] have shown the importance of Hitchin fibration in the geometric Langlands program. Ngo (with Laumon) has studied Hitchin fibration to prove an important step in Langlands program, so called Fundamental Lemma, which was conjectural from 1970-s and is one of the main mathematical discoveries in last decade.
