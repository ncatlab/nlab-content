## Overview

Liouville [[integrable systems]] can always be phrased in the form of a Lax pair depending on a spectral parameter belonging to so called spectral curve. This way the complex analytic theory of Riemann surfaces comes into play. In a landmark article in 1987, [[Nigel Hitchin]] introduced more refined viewpoint to a rather general class of integrable systems, where the spectral curve is a hyperelliptic curve (genus 2 or more). This system is defined on the cotangent bundle of moduli space of stable bundles studied by Ramanan, Narasimhan, Hitchin, Nitsure, [[Gerd Faltings|Faltings]], [[Carlos Simpson|Simpson]] (introduction of Higgs bundles!) and others. Some of the features of that system are more readily seen fro consideration of a canonical map from the cotangent bundle of the moduli space to the so-called Hitchin base, and the map is called the Hitchin fibration. 

The elliptic Calogero-Moser system is an example of Hitchin system. 

For other purposes than integrable systems, e.g. in representation theory, one can consider Hitchin fibration over other ground fields. [[Alexander Beilinson]] and [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] have shown the importance of Hitchin fibration in the geometric Langlands program. Ngo (with Laumon) has studied a Hitchin fibration to prove an important step in Langlands program, so called Fundamental Lemma, which was conjectural from 1970-s and is one of the main mathematical discoveries in last decade.
