## Idea

The _zigzag category_ is the [[category]] whose objects are [[diagram]]s that look like

$$
  \{
    t_0 \leftarrow t_1 \leftarrow t_2 \rightarrow t_3 \leftarrow t_4 
    \cdots
  \}
  \,.
$$


## Definition

Let $\mathbf{T}$ be the [[category]] defined as follows:

* An [[object]] is given by a triple of data $t \coloneqq (n,t_+,t_-)$, which is a [[partition]] of the [[poset]] $\{i \;|\; 1\leq i\leq n\}$ for some [[natural number]] $n \geq 0$ into two [[subset]] parts $t_+$ and $t_-$. (The corresponding diagram as above has nodes $t_0, \ldots, t_n$, and the arrow between $t_{i-1}$ and $t_i$ points forward to $t_i$ if $i \in t_+$, and backward if $i \in t_-$.) 

* A [[morphism]] is a [[monotone map]] preserving the partitions.

We will call $\mathbf{T}$ the __zigzag category__, or the __category of zigzag types__.

Also, notice that we have cleverly hidden the [[empty set]] among the objects.  We pat ourselves on the backs for doing this. (Here the zigzag type consists of a single node.) 


## Applications

Such zig-zag [[diagram]]s serve to model morphisms in an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] in terms of a presentation by a [[category with weak equivalences]]. See [[simplicial localization of a homotopical category]].
