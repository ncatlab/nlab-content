Let $\mathbf{T}$ be the category defined as follows:

* Objects are defined by triples of data $t:=(n,t_+,t_-)$, which are partitions of the sets $\{1,...,n\}$ into two disjoint subsets $t_+$ and $t_-$.  

* Morphisms are monotone maps preserving the partitions.  

We will call $\mathbf{T}$ the _zigzag category_, or the _category of zigzag types_.
