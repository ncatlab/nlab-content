A [[topological ring]] $R$ is an __adic noetherian ring__ if it is [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] as ring and it has a [[basis of topology]] consisting of all translations of the neighborhoods of zero of the form $I^n$ $n\gt 0$ where $I\subset R$ is a fixed ideal of $R$, and $R$ is Hausdorff and complete in that topology. A choice of such an ideal is said to be the defining ideal or (more French) the ideal of the definition of the topological ring $R$. If $R$ is adic noetherian ring an ideal $J\subset R$ is a defining ideal iff it is open and its powers tend to $\{0\}$. The topology of an adic noetherian ring $R$ with the defining ideal $I$ is said to be the **$I$-adic topology** and the descending filtration of $R$ by the powers of $I$ to be the **$I$-adic filtration**.

For an adic noetherian ring $R$ there is a construction of a [[ringed space]], its [[formal spectrum]] $Spf(R)$, which does not depend on the choice of the ideal $I\subset R$ generating its (fixed in advance) topology. The underlying topological space of $Spf(R)$ is $Spec(R/I)$ which is (under the above assumptions on $R$ and $I$) a closed subspace of $Spec(R)$ and it contains all closed points of $Spec(R)$.
