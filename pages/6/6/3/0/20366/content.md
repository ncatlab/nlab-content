[Telegram](https://telegram.org) (see official [FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)) is developing Telegram Open Network (TON) (see list.[wiki](https://list.wiki/Telegram_Open_Network_(TON) and wikipedia.[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_Open_Network)), centered around a new generation (and [[high performance DLs|high performance]]) [[blockchain]] project. TON is envisioned to support for decentralised applications and [[smart contract]]s, distributed file-storage service (TON Storage), micropayments, a proxy service (TON proxy) and TON DNS. TON had large private ICO for large investors in early 2018 and is supposed to be fully operational in Q4 2019. According to press ([kod.ru](https://kod.ru/ton-test-version-apr-2019), [zfr.su](https://zfr.su/nachalsya-zakrytyy-beta-test-telegram-open-network), [cryptor.net](https://cryptor.net/news/pavel-durov-zapustil-testnet-telegram-open-network-3490), [beincrypto](https://beincrypto.com/telegram-launches-open-network-testnet-in-private-beta/), [kryptonews](https://www.kryptonews.org/2019/04/12/telegram-launches-open-network-testnet-in-private-beta), [other](https://ton-telegram.net/news/testnet-launched)), TON testnet has started, with access only to limited parties, on April 11, 2019.

TON blockchain's native cryptocurrency is called Gram. The underlying blockchain protocol supports a number of innovative ideas helping scaling, including notably infinite sharding paradigm and instant hypercube routing. It employs a new [[virtual machine]] (TON VM), supporting algebraic types. TON has upgradeable  formal  blockchain  specifications and support for off-chain payment networks.

The whole thing will run on protocols used already by Telegram and use similar specs:

* specs: [TL language](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) ("Type Language", TON will use an upgrade, TL-B), [MTProto mobile protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto)
* JAVA MTProto implementation [github](https://github.com/ex3ndr/telegram-mt)
* github [OpenTl.ClientApi](https://opentl.github.io/OpenTl.ClientApi), [mtproto2json](https://github.com/nikat/mtproto2json)

It will use Telegram Passport.

* Telegram Passport [manual](https://core.telegram.org/passport), [example](https://core.telegram.org/passport/example), [telepass.me](https://telepass.me), [guide](https://technandu.com)

> Telegram is introducing a new feature called Passport, a single sign-on option for services that need actual real-world IDs or documents. Passport will let users store their files and data in Telegram's cloud and pass it directly on to services that need that information (via Neowin).
