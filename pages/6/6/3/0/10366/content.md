## Idea

The super-Poincar&#233; Lie algebra has certain exceptional super [[Lie algebra extensions]] by "[[central charges]]" which commute with the generators of the [[super translation Lie algebra]] and form a [[tensor]] [[representation]] of the remaining [[Lorentz group]] generators.

Here "central charges" is in quotation marks (and typically is so in the literature) since these charges will be in the [[center]] of the [[super translation Lie algebra]] but not in general in the center of the full [[super Poincare Lie algebra]].

## Examples

The "[[M-theory Lie algebra]]" is a polyvector extension of the super Poincar&#233; Lie algebra $\mathfrak{siso}_{N=1}(10,1)$ by polyvectors of rank $p = 2$ and $p=5$ (the [[M2-brane]] and the [[M5-brane]] in the [[brane scan]]), see below [Polyvector extensions as automorphism Lie algebras](#PolyvectorExtensionsAsAutomorphismLieAlgebras).

Similarly the _[[type II supersymmetry algebra]]_ in [[type II supergravity]].

## Properties

### Short multiplets

Extended supersymmetry algebras in general have
"short" [[supermultiplets]]. These are called _[[BPS states]]_.

### As automorphism Lie algebras of Lie $n$-superalgebras
 {#PolyvectorExtensionsAsAutomorphismLieAlgebras}

At least some of the [polyvector extensions](#PolyvectorExtensions) of the super Poincar&#233; Lie algebra arise as the [[automorphism]] super Lie algebras of the [[Lie n-algebra]] 
[[infinity-Lie algebra cohomology|extensions]] classified by the cocycles discussed above.

For instance the automorphisms of the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] gives the "[[M-theory Lie algebra]]"-extension of super-Poincar&#233; in 11-dimensions ([FSS 13](#FSS13)). This is also discussed at _[supergravity Lie 3-algebra -- Polyvector extensions](supergravity+Lie+3-algebra#Polyvector)_.
