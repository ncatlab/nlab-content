## Idea

In the context of [[homological algebra]] [[derived functor]]s are traditionally considered on a [[model structure on chain complexes]] and often they are evaluated only on chain complexes that are concentrated in a single degree. If instead they are evaluated on general chain complexes, one sometimes speaks of **hyper-derived functors** for emphasis.

Compare this to the usage of the term [[hypercohomology]]. This, too, is really just the basic definition of cohomology, but not restricted to [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]]s concentrated in a single degree.

## Properties

There is a certain [[spectral sequence]] that can help to compute values of hyper-derived functors. See the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spectral+sequence#HyperDerivedFunctors">Spectral sequences for hyper-derived functors</a>.
