#Idea#

The _Kan extension_ of a [[functor]]
$F : C \to D$ with respect to a functor
$$
 \array{
  C
  \\
  \downarrow^p
  \\
  C'
 }
$$

is, if it exists, a "best approximation" to 
the problem of finding a functor $C' \to D$ such that 
$$
  \array{
     C &\stackrel{F}{\to}& D
     \\
     \downarrow^p & \nearrow
     \\
     C'
  }
  \,,
$$
i.e. to extending the domain of $F$ through $p$ from $C$ to $C'$.

## Local and global definition ##

As for the definition of [[limit]] (and [[homotopy limit]]) and induced from the _local_ definition of [[adjoint functor]]s, there is a _local_ definition of what Kan extension meas, which applies to every single functor, and there is a _global_ definition, which applies to the category of all functors. If the local Kan extension of every single functor exists for some category, then both definitions coincide. 

In particular, the _global_ definition of Kan extension is a direct generalization of the _global_ definition of [[limit]].



#Definition#

We give the following three definitions, which are equivalent in good situations

* local definitions

  * Kan extension in terms of a universal natural transformation;

  * Kan extension in terms of weighted (co)limits.

* global definition

  * Kan extension as the adjoint to pullback of functor categories;


## Global definition: adjoint to pullback of functor categories ##

The functor $p : C \to C'$ induces, by precomposition, a functor between [[functor category|functor categories]]
$$
  p_*: G\mapsto G\circ p  : [C',D] \to [C,D]
  \,.
$$

The [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to $p_*$ is **left Kan extension** along $p$ of functors
$$
  Lan = Lan_p : [C,D] \to [C',D]
  \,,
$$
and the [[adjoint functor|right adjoint]] is **right Kan extension** along $p$ of functors
$$
  Ran = Ran_p: [C,D] \to [C',D]
  \,.
$$

This definition clearly makes sense as stated in particular also in [[enriched category theory]].

As discussed at [[adjoint functor]], it is possible that these adjoints do not exist, but may still be partially defined. Namely, for some functor $F\in [C,D]$ there exist a functor $Lan_p\,F:C'\to D$, *the left Kan extension of $F$ along $p$*,  and a natural isomorphism 
$$
Hom_{[C,D]}(F,p_*(-))\cong Hom_{[C',D]}(Lan\,F,-),
$$
i.e. a (co)representative of the functor $Hom_{[C,D]}(F,p_*(-))$. Similarly, right Kan extensions along $p$ may exist only for some $F$.


## Local definition: in terms of universal natural transformations ##

The above global definition _implies_ the following property:

[[generalized the|The]] left Kan extension $Lan F = Lan_p F$ of $F : C \to D$ along $p:C\to C'$ is a functor $Lan F : C' \to D$ equipped with a [[natural transformation]] $\eta_F : F \Rightarrow p_* Lan F$. 

<center markdown="1">[[kan-0.png:pic]]</center>

with the property that every other natural transformation
$F \Rightarrow p_* G$ factors uniquely through $\eta_F$ as

<center markdown="1">[[kan-1.png:pic]]</center>

Similarly for the right Kan extension, with the direction of the natural transformations reversed:

<center markdown="1">[[kan-2.png:pic]]</center>

It is clear that the definition in this form makes sense in every 2-category. In a bit different terminology, the left Kan extension 1-cell $F:C\to D$ along 1-cell $p\in K(C,C')$ in a 2-category $K$ is a pair $(Lan_p F,\alpha)$ where $\alpha : F\to Lan_p F\circ p$ is a 2-cell which reflects the object $F\in K(C,D)$ along the functor $p_* = K(p,D):K(C',D)\to K(C,D)$. 

This version of the definition clearly makes sense in any [[2-category]].

**Warning.** While this property is implied by the above global definition, it does not itself imply the global definition. For emphasis this definition here is sometimes called a **weak Kan extension** instead. See also the comment in the following section.



## Local definition: pointwise definition in terms of weighted (co)limits ##

We give now a list of ways to express the Kan extension of a functor in terms of [[weighted limit|weighted]] [[limit|(co)limit]]s. These definitions apply in particular in the case that of $V$-[[enriched category theory]] for $V$ a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]].

### in terms of weighted (co)limit###

The right Kan extension of a functor $F : C \to D$ along $p : C \to C'$ is at $c' \in C'$ the [[weighted limit]] over $F$ with weight $\hat p_{c'} : C^{op} \stackrel{C'(c',p(-))}{\to}  V$
$$
  (Ran_p F)(c') := lim^{C'(c',p(-))} F
  \,.
$$

Similarly the left Kan extension is given by the [[weighted limit|weighted colimit]]

$$
  (Lan_p F)(c') := colim^{C'(p(-),c')} F
  \,.
$$

### in terms of ends and coends ###

If the $V$-[[enriched category]] $D$ is [[power]]ed over $V$, then the above weighted limit may be re-expressed in terms of an [[end]] as

$$
  (Ran_p F)(c') \simeq \int_{c \in C} C'(c',p(c))\pitchfork F(c')
  \,.
$$

So in particular when $D = V$ this is

$$
  (Ran_p F)(c') \simeq \int_{c \in C} [C'(c',p(c)),F(c')]
  \,.
$$


Similarly, if $D$ is [[copower|tensored]] over $V$, then the left Kan extension is given by a [[coend]].

$$
  (Lan_p F)(c') \simeq \int^{c \in C} C'(p(c),c')\otimes F(c')
  \,.
$$

### in terms of (co)limits over comma-categories ###


In the special case that $V = Set$, and only then, there is an expression of the Kan extension as a (co)limit over a [[comma category]].

The right Kan extension of a functor of ordinary categories is given by the [[limit]]

$$
    (Ran_p F)(c')
      \simeq lim ((const_{c'}/p) \to C \stackrel{F}{\to} Set)
  \,,
$$

The left Kan extension of a functor of ordinary categories is given by the [[colimit]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (Lan_p F)(c')
      \simeq colim ((p/const_{c'}) \to C \stackrel{F}{\to} Set)
  \end{aligned}
$$

Here $(const_{c'}/p)$ and $(p/const_{c'})$ are [[comma category|comma categories]] in the notation described there.


**Warning.** Note, however, that _not_ all _weak Kan extensions_ (in the universal-transformation sense defined above) are computed in this way, and weak Kan extensions can exist even when $D$ does not admit very many limits.  For instance, the weak Kan extensions that arise in the study of [[derived functor]]s are not computed in this way.

Kan extensions that are computed by limits and colimits are sometimes called **pointwise** Kan extensions, as in [[Categories Work]].  On the other hand, some authors (such as Kelly) assert that only pointwise Kan extensions deserve the name "Kan extension," and use a term such as "weak Kan extension" for a functor equipped with a universal natural transformation.  It is certainly true that most Kan extensions which arise in practice are pointwise.  This distinction is even more important in [[enriched category]] theory.








# Definition in $(\infty,1)$-categories #

The global definition of Kan extensions for
$(\infty,1)$-functors in terms of left/right adjoints to pullbacks may be interpreted essentially verbatim in the context of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] using the corresponding notion of [[limit in quasi-categories]].

Details are in [section 4.3, p. 215](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=215)  of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]].


#Examples#

* For $C' = $ the [[point]], the right Kan extension of $F$ is the [[limit]] of $F$, $Ran F \simeq \lim F$ and the left Kan extension is the [[colimit]] $Lan F \simeq colim F$.

* For $f : X \to Y$ a [[site|morphism of sites]] coming from a functor $f^t : S_Y \to S_X$ of the underlying categories, the left Kan extension of functors along $f^t$ is the [[inverse image]] operation $f^{-1} : PSh(Y) \to PSh(X)$.

* see also [[examples of Kan extensions]]

### basic example: restriction and extenion of sheaves ###

For more on the following see also 

* [[restriction and extension of sheaves]]

The basic example for left Kan extensions using the above pointwise formula, is in the construction of the pullback of sheaves along a morphism of topological spaces. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous map and $F$ a presheaf over $X$. Then the formula $(f_* F)(U) = F(f^{-1}(U))$ clearly defines a presheaf $f_* F$ on $Y$, which is in fact a sheaf if $F$ is.
On the other hand, given a presheaf $G$ over $Y$ we can not
define pullback presheaf $(f^{-1} G)(V)=G(f(V))$ because $f(V)$ might not be open in general (unless $f$ is an open map). For Grothendieck sites such $f(V)$ would not make even sense. But one can consider approximating from above by $G(W)$ for all $W\supset f(V)$ which are open and take a colimit of this diagram of inclusions (all $W$ are bigger, so getting down to the lower bound means going reverse to the direction of inclusions). But inclusion $f(V)\subset W$ implies $V\subset f^{-1}(f(V))\subset f^{-1}(W)$. The latter identity $V\subset f^{-1}(W)$ involves _only open sets_. Thus we take a colimit over the comma category $(V\downarrow f^{-1})$ of $G$. If $G$ is a sheaf, the colimit $G(V)$ understood as a rule $V\mapsto G(V)$ is still not a sheaf, we need to [[sheafification|sheafify]]. The result is sheaf-theoretic pullback 
$$
f^{-1}G = \mathrm{sheafify}(V\mapsto\mathrm{colim}_{V\hookrightarrow f^{-1}W} G(W)) = \mathrm{sheafify}(V\mapsto\mathrm{colim}_{(V\downarrow f^{-1})} G)
$$ 
which is a sheaf and one can analyze this construction to show that $f^{-1}$ is a right adjoint to $f_*$. This usage of left Kan extension persists in the more general case of Grothendieck topologies. 



#Remark on terminology: pushforward vs. pullback#

Generally, for $p : C \to C'$ a [[functor]], the induced functor on [[functor category|functor categories]]
$$
  [C', D] \stackrel{- \circ p}{\to}
  [C,D]
$$

_pulls back_ a functor on $C'$ to a functor on $C$, as this goes in the direction opposite to that of $p$ itself.

In that sense one would denote this functor by $p^*$ and call the (left or right) Kan exension along $p$, which goes the other way, the _push forward_ of functors from $C$ to functors on $C'$.

On the other hand, a crucial application of Kan extensions is to [[presheaf]] categories, i.e. to situations where $C = S^{op}$ and $S' = C'^{op}$ with $S$ and $S'$ both being [[site]]s.

In these cases the [[site]] may be thought of as representing a topological space. In particular $S$ may be the [[partial order|poset]] $Open(X)$ of open subsets of a topological space $X$ and inclusions and simlarly for $S'$. In that case, morphisms of sites

$$
  Open(X)^{op} \to Open(X')^{op}
$$ 
come from morphisms of topological spaces going the other way
$$
  X \leftarrow X' : f
  \,,
$$
because a continuous maps $f : X' \to X$ of topological spaces induces a pullback 
$$
  f^{-1} : O(X)^{op} \to O(X')^{op}
$$
$$
  U \mapsto f^{-1}(U)
$$
of open subsets. This means that when a functor $O(X)^{op} \to Set$ is thought of as a presheaf on a site, then what looks like a pullback of functors along $p = f^{-1}$ corresponds geometrically to a _push-forward_ of pre-sheaves. Therefore in [[presheaf]] literature (such as [[Categories and Sheaves]])  the functor induced by $p$ is usually denoted $p_*$ and not $p^*$.

It is however noteworthy that also the opposite perspective does occur in geometrically motivated examples. For instance 

* if $C$ is the [[discrete category]] on smooth space and $D = U(1)$ is the discrete category on the smooth space $X$ underlying the Lie group $U(1)$, then smooth functors (i.e. functors [[internal category|internal to]] [[generalized smooth space|smooth spaces]]) $F : C \to D$ can be identified with smooth $U(1)$-valued functions on $X$, and the functor on these functor categories induced by a smooth functor $p : C \to C'$ does correspond to the familiar notion of _pullback_ of functions;

* and similar in higher degrees: if $C = P_1(X)$ is the smooth path groupoid of a smooth space and $D = \mathbf{B} U(1)$ the smooth [[group]] $U(1)$ regarded as a one-object [[Lie groupoid]], then smooth functors $C \to D$ correspond to smooth 1-forms $\in \Omega^1(X)$ on $X$, and precomposition with a smooth functor $p : P_1(X) \to P_1(X')$ corresponds to the familiar notion of _pullback_ of 
1-forms.

This means that whether or not Kan extension corresponds geometrically to pushforward or to pullback depends on the way (covariant or contravariant) in which the domain categories $C$, $C'$ are identified with geometric entities.
