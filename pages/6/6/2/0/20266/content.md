## Idea

The concept of a [[special linear group]] $SL(2,K)$ with $K = \mathbb{O}$ the [[octonions]] does not quite make sense, due to the failure of the [[octonions]] to be an [[associative algebra]]. 

Nevertheless, the pattern of the [[special linear groups]] of the other three [[real numbers|real]] [[normed division algebras]] suggests that for some suitably adjusted concept of "special linear group", it should make sense to speak of $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$, after all, and be essentially the [[spin group]] $Spin(9,1)$:
