## Idea

The concept of a [[special linear group]] $SL(2,K)$ with $K = \mathbb{O}$ the [[octonions]] does not quite make sense, due to the failure of the [[octonions]] to be an [[associative algebra]]. 

Nevertheless, the pattern of the [[special linear groups]] of the other three [[real numbers|real]] [[normed division algebras]] suggests that for some suitably adjusted concept of "special linear group", it should make sense to speak of $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$, after all, and that it should essentially be essentially the [[spin group]] $Spin(9,1)$:

[[!include exceptional spinors and division algebras -- table]]

[Dray and Manogue](#DM10) have shown how to interpret $Spin(9,1)$ as $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$ is as follows.   First, a warmup with the complex numbers. The space $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{C})$ of $2 \times 2$ hermitian matrices with entries in $\mathbb{C}$ may be identified with 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, since the determinant is a quadratic form of signature $(1,3)$.  Any element $g \in \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ acts as a linear transformation of $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{C})$ as follows: 

$$  X \mapsto g X g^\ast , \qquad X \in \mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{C})  $$

and this action preserves the determinant on $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{C})$, so we obtain a homomorphism from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ to $\mathrm{O}(1,3)$.  In fact this is a 2-1 homomorphism from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ onto $SO_0(1,3)$.   Since $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ is simply connected, this allows us to identify $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ with $\mathrm{Spin}(1,3) \cong \mathrm{Spin}(3,1)$.  

Following this pattern, the space $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{O})$ of $2 \times 2$ hermitian matrices with entries in $\mathbb{O}$ may be identified with 10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, since the determinant is a quadratic form of signature $(1,9)$.   (The determinant of an element of $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{O})$ is well-defined using the usual formula for the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix, because any octonion commutes with its conjugate.)  Let $\mathbb{M}_2(\mathbb{O})$ be the set of  $2 \times 2$ matrices octonions all of whose entries lie in an arbitrary subalgebra of $\mathbb{O}$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$.  Then the determinant of $g \in \mathbb{M}_2(\mathbb{O})$ is well-defined by the usual formula, and furthermore $(g X) g^\ast = g ( X g^\ast)$ for all $X \in \mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{O})$.   

Let $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{O})$ be the subgroup of linear transformations of $\mathbb{O}^2$ generated by those of the form 

$$   \psi \mapsto g \psi $$

where $g \in \mathbb{M}_2(\mathbb{O})$ has $det(g) = 1$.  This group acts
as linear transformation of $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{O})$ in a unique way such that

$$  X \mapsto (g X) g^\ast , \qquad X \in \mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{O})  $$

when $g \in \mathbb{M}_2(\mathbb{O})$ has $det(g) = 1$.   This action
preserves the determinant on $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{O})$.  Thus, there is a homomorphism from $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{O})$ to $\mathrm{O}(1,9)$, and in fact it maps to $\mathrm{SO}_0(1,9)$ in a 2-1 and onto way, which allows us to identify $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{O})$ with $\mathrm{Spin}(1,9) \cong \mathrm{Spin}(9,1)$.

Another proposal for making sense of $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$ is due to [Hitchin 18](#Hitchin18). In this approach, "$SL(2,\mathbb{O})$" is a submanifold of "$GL(2,\mathbb{O})$", which is an open orbit of $Spin(9,1) \times GL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on ${S} \otimes \mathbb{R}^2$.  Here ${S}$ is the 16-dimensional spin representation of $Spin(9,1)$; this may be identified with $\mathbb{O}^2$, which is one reason $Spin(9,1)$ is commonly identified with $SL(2,\mathbb{O})$.
