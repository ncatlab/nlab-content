* If $A$, $B$ are raw types and $x$ is a variable, then $\Pi(x:A).B$ is a raw type.
* If $A,B$ are raw types, $M$ is a raw term and $x$ is a variable, then $\lambda(x:A.B). M$ is a raw term.
* If $A$, $B$ are raw types, $M,N$ are raw terms and $x$ is a variable, then $App^{x:A.B}(M,N)$ is a raw term.
