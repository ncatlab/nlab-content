##  Idea 

The _RR field_ or _Ramond--Ramond field_ is a [[gauge theory|gauge field]] appearing in  [[supergravity|10-dimensional type II supergravity]].

Mathematically the RR field on a space $X$ is a [[cocycle]] in [[differential K-theory]] -- or rather, in full generality, in [[twisted differential K-theory|twisted differential]] [[KR-theory]] subject to a [[self-dual higher gauge field]] constrained encoded by a quadratic form defining an [[11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] on twisted differential KR cocycles.

Accordingly, the [[field strength]] of the RR field, i.e. the image of the [[differential cohomology|differential K-cocycle]] in deRham cohomology, is an inhomogeneous even or odd differential form


* in [[type IIA string theory]]
  $$
    F_{RR} = R_0 + R_2 + \cdots
  $$

* in [[type IIB string theory]]
  $$
    F_{RR} = R_1 + R_3 + \cdots
  $$

The components of this are sometimes called the RR forms. 

In the presence of a nontrivial [[Kalb–Ramond field]] the RR field is [[twisted cohomology|twisted]]: a cocycle in the corresponding [[twisted K-theory]].

Moreover, the RR field is constrained to be a [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-dual]] differential K-cocycle in a suitable sense.

[[!include electric-magnetic duality -- table]]

The RR field derives its name from the way it shows up when the [[supergravity]] theory in question is derived as an effective background theory in [[string theory]]. From the [[sigma-model]] perspective of the string the RR field is the condensate of fermionic 0-mode excitations of the type II superstring for a particular choice of boundary conditons called the _Ramond_ boundary condititions. Since these boundary conditions have to be chosen for _two_ spinor components, the name appears twice.

### Irrational RR-charge
 {#IrrationalRRCharge}

An argument that RR-charge may occur in [[irrational number|irrational]] ratios is due to

* [[Constantin Bachas]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Christoph Schweigert]], around (2.8) of _Flux Stabilization of D-branes_, JHEP 0005:048,2000 ([arXiv:hep-th/0003037](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0003037))

In a sequence of followup articles, authors found this problematic and tried to make sense of it:

* [[Washington Taylor]], _D2-branes in B fields_, JHEP 0007 (2000) 039 ([arXiv:hep-th/0004141](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0004141))

> In this article it was argued that the D0-brane charge arising from the integral over the D2-brane of the pullback of the B field is cancelled by the bulk contributions, but in this calculation it was implicitly assumed that the gauge field $C^{(1)}$ is constant. (from [Zhou 01](#Zhou01))
