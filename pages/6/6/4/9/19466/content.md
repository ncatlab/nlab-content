## Idea

The idea of _presheaf of groupoids_ may refer to one of the following distinct but closely related concepts:

1. a [[functor]] from some [[opposite category]] to the [[1-category]] [[Grpd]] of all [[small groupoids]];

1. a [[Grpd]]-[[enriched functor]] from the opposite of a [[Grpd]]-[[enriched category]] to [[Grpd]] canonically regarded as enriched over itself, all with respect to its [[cartesian closed category]]-structure;

1. a [[pseudofunctor]] from the opposite of a plain category to the [[2-category]] (in fact: [[(2,1)-category]]) [[Grpd]] of all small groupoids;

1. a [[2-functor]] from the [[opposite 2-category]] of some [[2-category]] to the [[2-category]] [[Grpd]] of all small groupoids.

In the last two cases one also speaks of _[[pre-stacks]] of groupoids_ or _[[(2,1)-presheaves]]_.

The first two of these carry [[structures]] of [[homotopical categories]], even of  [[model categories]], that make them [[presentable (infinity,1)-category]]-presentations of the latter two.

Under the [[simplicial nerve]]-constructions, presheaves of groupoids in the sense of the first two items form a [[full subcategory]] of [[simplicial presheaves]], and their [[model category]]-structures enhance to the corresponding [[model structures on simplicial presheaves]], which [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|present]] _[[(∞,1)-presheaves]] of [[∞-groupoids]]_, hence _pre-[[∞-stacks]]_.

## Examples
 {#Examples}

* For $\mathcal{C}$ an ordinary [[site]], each [[covering]] family $\{U_i \overset{\iota_i}{\to} X\}$ induces a _[[Cech groupoid]]_, which is really a presheaf of groupoids

$$
  C(\{U_i\}) \in [\mathcal{C}^{op}, Grpd]
  \,.
$$
