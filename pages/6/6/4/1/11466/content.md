##Idea

A [[topological ring]] $R$ is said to have a _(left) linear topology_ if it has a [[topological base]] of neighbourhoods of 0 consisting of (left) ideals.

Taking this apart we have a **definition/proposition** of such a topology, given by a left uniform filter:

###### Proposition (Gabriel)
A nonempty family of left ideals in $R$ is a left [[uniform filter]] (=[[topologizing filter]]) of left ideals iff it is a basis of neighborhood of $0$ of some
left linear topology. In other words, the following conditions hold:

[[filter|Filter]] axioms: (0) $\{R\}$ is open and:

(i) If $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq \mathfrak{b}$ are left ideals and $\mathfrak{a}$ is open, then so is $\mathfrak{b}$.

(ii) If $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ are open left ideas, then so is $\mathfrak{a}\cap\mathfrak{b}$.

Uniform filter condition:

(UF) If $\mathfrak{a}$ is an open left ideal and $r\in R$, then the left ideal

$$(\mathfrak{a}:r)= \{x\in R\mid x r\in \mathfrak{a}\}$$

is open.
