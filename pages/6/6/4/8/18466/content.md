## Idea

What is called _causal perturbation theory_ is a mathematically rigorous construction of _[[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]_ ([[gauge theory|gauge]]-) [[quantum field theory]], such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], based on a mathematical formulation of [[renormalization]] by St&#252;ckelberg-Bogoliubov-Epstein-Glaser ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)).

Causal perturbation theory may be regarded as providing a well-defined consistent generalization from [[quantum mechanics]] to [[quantum field theory]] on [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian]] [[spacetimes]] of the construction of the [[S-matrix]] via the [[Dyson formula]] ("[[time-ordered products]]") in the [[interaction picture]] .

A key idea of causal perturbation theory is that the [[interaction]] term $V$ is considered multiplied with some [[smooth function]] $g$ which has [[compact support]] on [[spacetime]]. This hence serves as a spacetime-dependent "[[coupling constant]]" which "switches off" the interaction outside a compact region, but not discontinuously as in many other schemes, but smoothly, hence "adiabatically" in terminology borrowed from [[thermodynamics]]. Therefore this is often called the "[[adiabatic switching]]" function, or similar.

The corresponding [[S-matrix]] would naively be given by the [[Dyson formula]]

$$
  S_g \coloneqq T \exp\left( \int_X g(x) V(x) dvol(x) \right)
$$

for $V$ the [[interaction]] term, and "$T$" indicating the [[time-ordered product]]. Causal perturbation theory proceeds by [[axiom|axiomatizing]] the key structural properties of this "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]" [[S-matrix]], making sense of the "[[time-ordered product]]" by appropriate [[causal locality|causal ordering]] (whence the name of the approach) and then proving by [[induction]] that solutions to these axioms exist. 

It turns out that at each step in the [[induction]] (corresponding to each loop order) a [[distribution]] has to be [extended to a point](extension%20of%20distributions#SolutionSpaceOfPointExtensions), namely to the point at which the [[interaction]] takes place. A key theorem ([Epstein-Glaser 73, section 5](EpsteinGlaser73), [this prop.](extension+of+distributions#SpaceOfPointExtensions)) states that this extension is parameterized by a finite-dimensional space of [[point-supported distributions]] at that point. This freedom in [[extension of distributions]] is identified with the traditional [[renormalization]] freedom in [[perturbative quantum field theory]], see at _[[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]]_ for more on this point. 

(It may be argued, vividly so in [Scharf 95, p. 181-182](#Scharf95), that the notorious "infinities" that "plague" quantum field theory in other approaches are nothing but the result of incorrectly dealing with the issue of [[extension of distributions]]. )

In fact the [[interacting field algebra]] induced by the [[S-matrix]] constructed via causal perturbation theory this way is a model for [[Fedosov's formal deformation quantization]] of the given [[local Lagrangian density]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16](#HawkinsRejzner16)), thus justifying the method from first principles of (perturbative) [[quantization]].


The key axiom imposed on the [[S-matrix]] in causal perturbation theory is [[causal locality]], whence the name of the approach. This axiom asks that if adiabatic switching functions $g$ and $h$ have [[spacelike]] separated [[supports]] then the S-matrix _factors_

$$
  S_{g + h} = S_g S_h
  \,.
$$  

The [[time-ordered products]] $T(..)$ of [[field (physics)|fields]] are handled by splitting of [[distributions]] using tools from [[microlocal analysis]]. This is the mathematically rigorous step that takes care of what in other approaches are the "ultraviolet divergencies".

Originally the idea was that in the end the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] $g \to 1$ had to be taken, removing the adiabatic switching of the the compact support of the interaction. In general this limit does not exist ("infrared divergencies", e.g. [AAS 10, section 6](#AAS10)).

But in ([Ilin-Slavnov 78](#IlinSlavnov78)) it was observed that in fact the [[algebra of observables]] on any [[bounded subsets|bounded]] region may be computed with a $g$ whose [[compact support]] contains that region. Later in ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00](#BrunettiFredenhagen00)) it was pointed out that this means that causal perturbation theory in fact serves to construct the [[local net of observables]] of the [[perturbative quantum field theory]], as in the [[axioms]] for [[AQFT]] and in fact as in the axioms of [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]], but with values in [[formal power series algebras]] (as befits a [[perturbation theory]]) instead of [[C*-algebras]] (suitable for [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]). This way causal perturbation theory leads to a unification of [[AQFT]] [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]] with [[perturbative quantum field theory]]. This unification is now known as **[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]]**, see there for more.



## Properties

### Main theorem of renormalization
 {#MainTheoremOfRenormalization}

A central result in causal perturbation theory is called the _[[main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory]]_. This says that any two _renormalization schemes_, hence any two solutions to the inductive construction of the [[S-matrix]] $V \mapsto S(V)$,  as indicated above, for [[interaction]] terms $V$, are related by a unique natural transformation $Z \colon V \to V'$

$$
  S' = S \circ Z
  \,.
$$

The collection of these operations $Z$ forms a [[group]] called the _[[Stückelberg-Peterson renormalization group]]_. 

This is a mathematical reflection of the idea that renormalization is about regarding a [[perturbative quantum field theory]] with [[interaction]] $V$ as a [[effective field theory]] at some energy scale and then discovering that at higher energy there is a more fundamental interaction $Z(V)$ which effectively looks like $V$ at lower energy.
