The categories mailing list ([url](https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/)) is a popular mailing list for [[category theory]]. It commenced in 1990 and is still (somewhat) active. The journal [[TAC]] was [launched on the mailing list in January 1995](https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/elec-journal).

The messages are archived in a number of different ways, depending on date:

* For June 1994 to November 1999, there is a curated website, organised alphabetically by topic/title: <https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/>

* For 11 March 1990 (the start) to July 2009 (when a change in Outlook led to a halt in archiving), there are compiled monthly digests, organised in yearly/monthly folders here: <https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/archive/>

* An dump of the [Gmane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmane) archive (otherwise only accessible via the protocol [nntp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol)) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/punkdit/categories/), which is searchable, but not sorted or archived in any particularly human-readable way.
