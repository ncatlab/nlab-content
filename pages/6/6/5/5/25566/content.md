The *Categories mailing list* is a [mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list) on the topic of *[[category theory]]*. 

The list commenced in 1990 and is still  active. From 1990 to 2023, the mailing list was hosted by Mount Allison University (categories@mta.ca) and moderated by [[Bob Rosebrugh]]. In 2023, the mailing list was transitioned to Macquarie University (categories@mq.edu.au) and is currently moderated by [[Jean-Simon Lemay]].

The journal *[[Theory and Applications of Categories]]* was [launched on the mailing list in January 1995](https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/elec-journal).

## Archives

The list's messages are archived in a number of different ways, depending on date:

* For June 1994 to November 1999, there is a curated website, organised alphabetically by topic/title: <https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/>

* For 11 March 1990 (the start) to July 2009 (when a change in Outlook led to a halt in archiving), there are compiled monthly digests, organised in yearly/monthly folders here: <https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/archive/>

* An dump of the [Gmane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmane) archive (otherwise only accessible via the protocol [nntp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol)) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/punkdit/categories/), which is searchable, but not sorted or archived in any particularly human-readable way.
