## Idea

One can view a [[probability measure]] $p$ on a space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ as a "pile of mass", for example, of sand, on the space $X$. 
Using this picture, given two probability spaces $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$, there could be many ways of moving the mass from $X$ to $Y$ in such a way that the sand from the pile $p$ is arranged to form the pile $q$. (The mass from which point goes to which point, or points?)
This "way of moving the mass" is called a *transport plan*, and it is usually encoded by a joint distribution or by a [[Markov kernel]] (see below). 

It is useful to keep track of *in which way* we are rearranging the mass $p$ to form $q$, and we can see these different ways as different morphisms, between the objects $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$, in a  [[category of couplings]]. 


## Definition

Let $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$ be [[probability spaces]]. A **coupling** or **transport plan** between $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$ is a probability space $(X\times Y, \mathcal{A}\otimes\mathcal{B},r)$ where 

* $\mathcal{A}\otimes\mathcal{B}$ is the [[tensor product]] [[sigma-algebra]] on the [[topological product space|product space]] $X\times Y$ (generated by the sets $A\times B$ with $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$);

* the [[measure]] $r$ has $p$ and $q$ as marginals, in the sense that for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$,

   $$
     r(A\times Y) \,=\, p(A) 
     \;\;
     \text{and}
     \;\;
     r(X\times B) \,=\, q(B)
     \,.
   $$

## Main constructions

### Identity coupling

Given a probability space $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$, the **identity coupling** or **diagonal coupling** is given by the following measure on $\mathcal{A}\otimes\mathcal{A}$:
$$
\Delta_p (A\times A') = p(A\cap A') 
$$
for all $A,A'\in\mathcal{A}$.

Intuitively, this is a copy of $p$ on $X$ concentrated on the diagonal subset $\{(x,x):x\in X\}\subseteq X\times X$.
(Whenever $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is standard Borel, the diagonal subset is measurable, and so this intuition can be made precise.)

This coupling gives the [[identity]] in the [[category of couplings]].
In terms of transport plans, this corresponds to not moving any mass (almost surely).


### Independent coupling

Given probability spaces $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$ the **independent coupling** or **product coupling** or **constant coupling** is given by the product measure $p\otimes q$, i.e.
$$
(p\otimes q)(A\times B) = p(A)\,q(B)
$$
for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$.

In terms of transport plans, this arranges the mass from almost all points of $X$ to a distribution proportional to $q$, (almost surely) independently of the point of origin.


### Composition of couplings

Let $(X,\mathcal{A},p)$, $(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$, $(Z,\mathcal{C},r)$ be [[standard Borel]] probability spaces, and consider transport plans $s$ from $p$ to $q$ and $t$ from $q$ to $r$. 
The **composite transport plan** $t\circ s$ from $p$ to $r$ is defined as follows:
$$
(t\circ s)(A\times C) = \int_Y s'(A|y)\,t'(C|y) q(dy)
$$
for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $C\in\mathcal{C}$, and where $s'$ and $t'$ are the [[Markov kernel#regular_conditionals_from_a_joint_distribution|regular conditional distributions]] associated to $s$ and $t$ given $Y$.
The interpretation is that the mass in moved according to the plan $s$ and then according to the plan $t$, and in case the transport is stochastic, the two transitions are taken independently.

This construction gives composition in the [[category of couplings]]. When the transport plans are induced by functions or kernels (see below), the composition of transport plans is given by the composition of functions or kernels.

In [Kozen-Silva-Voogd'23](#non_borel), this construction was extended beyond the standard Borel case. (See there for the details.)

### Couplings induced by functions

Let $f:(X,\mathcal{A},p)\to(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$ be a [[measure-preserving function]]. 
One can define the "deterministic" transport plan $r_f$ as follows,
$$
r_f(A\times B) = p\big(A\cap f^{-1}(B)\big)
$$
for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$.
Intuitively, this maps all the mass at $x$ to the point $f(x)$, for every $x\in X$.

Note that in general there may exist no measure-preserving function between two probability spaces, for example, on the real line, if $p$ is a [[Dirac measure|Dirac delta]] and $q$ is not. 
A construction that always exists is in terms of [[Markov kernels]], see below.

### Couplings induced by kernels

Let $k:(X,\mathcal{A},p)\to(Y,\mathcal{B},q)$ be a [[Markov kernel#measurepreserving_kernels|measure-preserving Markov kernel]]. 
One can define a transport plan $r_k$ as follows,
$$
r_k(A\times B) = \int_A k(B|x)\,p(dx) 
$$
for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$.
Intuitively, this maps all the mass at $x$ to a measure on $Y$ proportional to the measure $B\mapsto k(B|x)$. 

Note that in the formula above, the measure $B\mapsto k(B|x)$ is invoked only for almost all $x$, and so it is insensitive to changes in $k$ on a $p$-measure-zero set. 
In a certain sense, this transporting the *mass* of $p$, more than the single points $x$.

In many cases, such as if $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B})$ are [[standard Borel]], every transport plan is in the form $r_k$ for some $k$. See also [[category of couplings#equivalence_of_the_definitions|the discussion at "category of couplings"]].

### Bayesian inversion

Couplings are in some sense undirected, meaning that every transport plan from $X$ to $Y$ can also be seen as (and canonically induces) a transport plan from $Y$ to $X$.

This makes the [[category of couplings]] canonically a [[dagger category]].

For transport plans specified by kernels, this symmetry corresponds exactly to [[Bayesian inversion]] of kernels.
