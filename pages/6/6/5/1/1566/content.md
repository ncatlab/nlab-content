## Definition

### In Sets

A _commutative monoid_ is a [[monoid]] where the multiplication satisfies the commutative law:
$$x y = y x.$$

Alternatively, just as a [[monoid]] can be seen as a [[category]] with one object, a commutative monoid can be seen as a [[bicategory]] with one object and one morphism (or equivalently, a [[monoidal category]] with one object).

Commutative monoids with [[homomorphisms]] between them form a _[[category of commutative monoids]]_.

### In any symmetric monoidal category


More generally, the concept makes sense [[internalization|internal]] to any [[symmetric monoidal category]]. See at _[[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category]]_ for details.


## Examples

* An [[abelian group]] is a commutative monoid that is also a [[group]].

* The [[natural numbers]] (together with 0) form a commutative monoid under addition.

* Every bounded [[semilattice]] is an _idempotent_ commutative monoid, and every idempotent commutative monoid yields a semilattice, (see that entry).

Examples of [[commutative monoids in a symmetric monoidal category]]:

1. A commutative monoid in the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[category of vector spaces]] is a [[commutative algebra]];

1. A commutative monoid in the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[category of chain complexes]] of vector spaces is a [[differential graded-commutative algebra]];

1. A commutative monoid in the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[category of chain complexes of super vector spaces]] is a [[differential graded-commutative superalgebra]].
