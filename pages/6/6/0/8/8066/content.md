Game theory is the study of strategic interaction between agents. It is often used for mathematical modelling of real-world situations in which agents interact, including in microeconomics, computer science and ecology.

Game theory should not be confused with [[game semantics]], which has some terminology and history in common but has little overlap in practice.

##Via coalgebras##

Several authors have approached game theory through coalgebraic systems theory, defining games as elements of the [[terminal coalgebra for an endofunctor|terminal coalgebra]] of an appropriate functor. This puts the concepts of _state_ and _state transition_ in a game to centre stage. It is closely related to [extensive form games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive-form_game), whereby a game is defined by its tree of plays.

Perhaps the first paper to use this approach is [Pavlovic 2009](#Pavlovic09). Others are [Abramsky and Winschel 2017](#AbramskyWinschel17) and [Ghani, Kupke, Lambert and Forsberg 2018](#Ghani18a), the latter of which connects coalgebraic game theory with compositional game theory.

##Compositional game theory##

Open games approach games as open systems, making them morphisms of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] which can be depicted as [[string diagram|string diagrams]], in the spirit of [[applied category theory]]. See [Ghani, Hedges, Winschel and Zahn 2018](#Ghani18b).

Open games have a close connection to [[lens (in computer science)|lenses]]. This can be used to situate open games inside a symmetric monoidal [[double category]] in a game-theoretically interesting way, see [Hedges 2018](#Hedges18).

##Homotopy and game theory##

[[homotopy|Homotopies]] between strategy profiles have been considered as a practical method to compute Nash equilibria (see [Herings and Peeters 2010](#Herings10)). This has never been studied categorically, but it suggests a possible route towards a higher-categorical approach to game theory.
