The **Monster group** $M$ is a [[finite group]] that is the largest of the [[sporadic finite simple group]]s. It has order

$$
 \begin{aligned}
& 2^{46}\cdot 3^{20}\cdot 5^9\cdot 7^6\cdot 11^2\cdot 13^3\cdot 17\cdot 19\cdot 23\cdot 29\cdot 31\cdot 41\cdot 47\cdot 59\cdot 71 
  \\
 & = 808017424794512875886459904961710757005754368000000000
 \end{aligned}
$$

and contains all but six of the other 25 [[sporadic finite simple groups]] as [[subquotient]]s. 

In a famous paper 

* Griess, _The Friendly Giant_ , Inventiones (1981)

the existence of the largest simple sporadic group was proved. The author constructs "by hand" a non-associative but commutative algebra of dimension 196883, and showed that the [[automorphism group]] of this algebra is the conjectured friendly giant/monster simple group. The name "Friendly Giant" for the Monster did not take on.

After Griess found this algebra [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]] and Meurman and/or Borcherds showed that the Griess algebra is just the degree 2 part of the infinite dimensional [[Moonshine vertex algebra]].
