#Idea#

The homotopy category of an [[(infinity,1)-category]] is, roughly, the best [[category|1-categorical]] approximation.

#Definition#

The [[nerve|simplicial nerve]] functor
$N :$ [[Cat]] $\to$ [[SSet]] has a [[left adjoint]]
$$
 h : SSet \to Cat
 \,.
$$
For $C$ an [[(infinity,1)-category]] regarded as a [[quasi-category]], hence as a [[simplicial set]] with extra [[stuff, structure, property|property]], its **homotopy category** is its image $h C$ under this functor.
