## Idea

The notion of *extensions* in a [[double category]] abstracts that of the  classical operation of [[extension of scalars]] of [[bimodules]].
Indeed, they are usually available in [[framed bicategories]], which are formal analogoues to double categories of bimodules; and indeed extensions in a double category of bimodules correspond to extensions of scalars.

The dual notion is that of **[[restriction (double category theory)|restriction]]**.
Since having all restrictions is equivalent to having all extensions, and since in double category theory one usually works with the former, we redirect the reader to the aforementioned page.
