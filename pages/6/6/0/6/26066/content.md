# Quasi-Frobenius algebra

## Definition

Recall that an [[algebra]] is a [[Frobenius algebra]] if its left [[regular representation]] $L(A)$ is isomorphic to its right regular representation $R(A)$. For *quasi*-Frobenius algebras, this isomorphism is weakened.

###### Definition
An algebra $A$ is called a quasi-Frobenius algebra if the isomorphism classes of idecomposable components of its left-regular representation $L(A)$ matches those of its right-regular representation $R(A)$.
