# Idea #

The _Karoubi envelope_ of a [[category]] is the universal way to ensure that every [[idempotent]] is a [[split idempotent]].  It is the [[Set]]-enriched version of [[Cauchy completion]].

Karoubi envelopes for [[(infinity,1)-category|(âˆž,1)-categories]] are discussed in section 4.4.5 of

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]. 


Some discussion of the stable version is in section 4.1.2 of

* [[David Ben-Zvi]], John Francis, David Nadler, _Integral Transforms and Drinfeld Centers in Derived Algebraic Geometry_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0157), [[geometric infinity-function theory|nLab entry]])

and section 2.3 of 

* [[David Ben-Zvi]], David Nadler, _The Character Theory of a Complex Group_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1247))

In section 3.1.2 of latter are also given
references (to Neeman and Lurie) for an important result of Neeman's about Karoubi closure and compact generators.

The Karoubi envelope for the additive case is covered at 

* Dror Bar-Natan, Scott Morrison, _The Karoubi envelope and Lee's degeneration of Khovanov homology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606542))
