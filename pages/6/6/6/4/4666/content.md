The __trivial group__ is the [[point]] $\bullet$ interpreted as a [[group]], often denoted $1$ or $0$.  Its underlying [[set]] is a [[singleton]], and its unique [[element]] is the [[identity element|identity]].

The trivial group is a [[zero object]] (both [[initial object|initial]] and [[terminal object|terminal]]) of [[Grp]].

Given any group $G$, the unique group [[homomorphisms]] from $1$ to $G$ and from $G$ to $1$ make $1$ both a [[subgroup]] and a [[quotient group]] of $G$.  In such a guise, it is called the __trivial subgroup__ or __trivial quotient group__ of $G$.

We also denote the trivial group as $\{1\}$ or $\{0\}$, especially when viewed as a trivial subgroup.  The trivial quotient group of $G$ may be denoted $G/G$ or $\{G\}$.

The trivial group is an example of a [[trivial algebra]].
