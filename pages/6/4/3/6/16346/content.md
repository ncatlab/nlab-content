## Idea

While _[[Cartan geometry]]_ was originally conceived of in the context of [[differential geometry]], its principles and constructions make sense much more generally. In particular they make sense in the context of [[supergeometry]]. The implementation of Cartan geometry in supergeometry may well be called _super-Cartan geometry_ or _Cartan super-geometry_.

While this terminology has not been used traditionally, nevertheless key ingredients of super-Cartan geometry are well known in the literature, and all the more is it useful to make them explicit as what they are.

Essentially all of the [[supergravity]] literature in [[physics]] is about super-Cartan geometry for the inclusion of a [[Lorentz group]] inside a [[super Poincare group]], in direct analogy to how ordinary [[Einstein gravity]] ([[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]]) is the Cartan geometry of the inclusion of a Lorentz group inside a plain [[Poincare group]] -- this in fact being Cartan's original and motivating example for the whole theory. Where physicists speak of "locally gauging [[supersymmetry]]" the mathematical formulation of that is precisely this: the "[[supersymmetry]]" [[supergroup]] is the [[super Poincare group]] [[action|acting]] on [[super Minkowski spacetime]], and "locally gauging" it means exactly to consider [[spacetimes]] that are locally ([[tangent space]]-wise) modeled on [[super Minkowski space]], while globally varying according to a [[Lorentz group]]-[[G-structure]], hence the super-analog of a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]].

Physics literature usually refers to the "superspace formulation" of supergravity when referring to the formulation of the theory in [[supergeometry]].,
One physics references which moreover makes the super-Cartan-geometric picture of [[supergravity]] very explicit is ([D'Auria-Fre 82](#DAuriaFre82), [Castellani-D'Auria-Fre 91](#CastellaniDAuriaFre91)). (These authors in fact also make the [[higher Cartan geometry]] hidden here fairly explicit, see there for more.), even though these authors do not use this mathematical terminology. A reference that very clearly identifies the role of the matematics of supergeometric [[G-structures]] in [[supergravity]] is ([Lott 01](#Lott01)), and the followup ([Egeileh-Chami 13](#EgeilehChami13)) to that article also makes the terminology Cartan-geometry explicit.

This provides ample example and application of super-Cartan geometry for the case where $G/H$ is a [[super vector space]], hence for the case corresponding to [[G-structure]]. More general super-Cartan geometry apparently remains to be explored.
