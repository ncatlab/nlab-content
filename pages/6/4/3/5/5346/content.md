## Idea

The _model structure on simplicial groups_ is a presentation of the 
[[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groups]] in [[∞Grpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]]. See [[group object in an (∞,1)-category]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_prop #ModelStructureOnSimplicialGroups} 
###### Proposition

There is a "projective" [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] $sGrp$ of [[simplicial groups]] where a morphism is

* a [[weak equivalence]] if the [[underlying]] morphism is a weak equivalence in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], hence a [[simplicial weak homotopy equivalence]];

* a [[fibration]] if the underlying morphism is a fibration in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], hence a  [[Kan fibration]];

* a [[cofibration]] if it has the [[left lifting property]] with respect to all [[acyclic fibrations]].

## Properties

### Further model category properties
 {#FurtherModelCategoryProperties}


#### Fibrations

\begin{proposition}\label{EveryObjectIsFibrant}
  Every object in the projective model structure (Prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSimplicialGroups}) is [[fibrant object|fibrant]].
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  This statement amounts to saying that the underlying simplicial set of any simplicial group is a [[Kan complex]], which is the case by Moore's theorem ([here](simplicial+group#EverySimplicialGroupIsAKanComplex)).
\end{proof}


#### Cofibrations
 {#Cofibrations}

\begin{proposition}\label{sGrpIsCofibrantlyGenerated}
  The model structure on [[sGrp]] from Prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSimplicialGroups} is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]], with generating (acyclic) cofibrations the images under the degreewise [[free group]]-functor $F$ of the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary]] and [[horn]]-inclusions into simplicial [[simplices]]:
$$
  I \;=\;
  \big\{
    F(i_n) \,\colon\, F(\partial \Delta[n]) \hookrightarrow F(\Delta[n])
  \big\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
$$
$$
  J 
    \;=\;
  \big\{
    F(j_n^k) \,\colon\, F(\Lambda_k[n]) \hookrightarrow F(\Delta[n])
  \big\}_{
    {n \in \mathbb{N}_+,}
    \atop
    {0 \leq k \leq n}
  }
$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  By definition, the model structure on simplicial groups is the right [[transferred model structure]] from the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], along the [[forgetful functor]] $sGrp \to sSet_{Qu}$ with [[left adjoint]] the degreewise [[free group]]-functor $F \,\colon\,sSet \to sGrp$. Now since $sSet_{Qu}$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] with generating (acyclic) cofibrations $i_n$ ($j_n^k$)
([this Prop.](classical+model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#AsACofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory)) it follows (by [this Prop.](transferred+model+structure#SufficientConditions)) that so is [[sGrp]], with generating (acyclic) cofibrations their images under $F$, as claimed. \end{proof}



\begin{definition}\label{AlmostFreeMaps}
**(almost free maps)** \linebreak
A homomorphims of simplicial groups is called *almost free* if it is degreewise the inclusion into the [[amalgamation of groups|amalgamation]] with a [[free group]]

$$
  f_n 
    \,\colon\, 
  \mathcal{G}_n 
    \xhookrightarrow{\phantom{---}}
  \mathcal{G}_n \star F(S_n)
$$
in a compatible way.
\end{definition}
([Goerss & Jardine (1999), p. 270](#GoerssJardine99); [Speirs (2015), §A.4](#Speirs15))

\begin{proposition}
\label{ClosurePropertiesOfAlmostFreeMaps}
 The [[class]] of almost free maps (Prop. \ref{AlmostFreeMaps}) is closed under

1. [[isomorphism]]

1. [[pushout]]

1. [[transfinite composition]]

\end{proposition}
[Speirs (2015), Prop. A.4.1](#Speirs15)

\begin{proposition}\label{CharacterizationOfCofibrations}
In the model structure on simplicial groups (Prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSimplicialGroups}):  

1. Every *almost free* homomorphism (Def. \ref{AlmostFreeMaps}) is a cofibration.

1. Every cofibration is a [[retract]] of an almost free map

\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The first statement is proven in [Goerss & Jardine (1999) Cor. 1.10](#GoerssJardine99).
For the second statement, use with Prop. \ref{sGrpIsCofibrantlyGenerated}, that the model category is cofibrantly generated by $I = \{F(i_n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, which [means](cofibrantly+generated+model+category#CellsAndInjectives) that the cofibrations of $sGrp$ are the [[retracts]] of the [[relative cell complexes]] (i.e. of the [[transfinite compositions]] of [[pushouts]]) of the $F(i_n)$. Therefore it is now sufficient to see that 
$$
  Cell\big(
    \{ F(i_n) \}
  \big)
  \;\;
  \supset
  \;\;
  AlmostFreeMaps
  \,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \text{and}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;  
  Cell\big(
    \{ F(i_n) \}
  \big)
  \;\;
  \subset 
  \;\;
  AlmostFreeMaps
  \,.
$$
The first statement is [Goerss & Jardine (1999), V Prop. 1.9](#GoerssJardine99). The second statement follows by Prop. \ref{ClosurePropertiesOfAlmostFreeMaps} after observing that $F(i_n)$ itself is almost free.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{AllCofibrationsOfSimplicialGroupsAreMonomorphisms}
  All cofibrations in [[sGrp]] are [[monomorphisms]], hence the [[underlying]] maps are [[cofibrations]] in [[classical model structure on simplicial sets|$sSet_{Qu}$]].
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Since the almost free maps (Def. \ref{AlmostFreeMaps}) are manifestly monomorphisms and since all cofibrations are retracts of almost free maps (Prop. \ref{CharacterizationOfCofibrations}) this follows form the fact that injections (cofibrations in $sSet_{Qu}$) are closed under retracts.
\end{proof}


### Relation to reduced simplicial sets

+-- {: .num_prop #QuillenEquivalenceWithReducedSimplicialSets} 
###### Proposition
**([[Quillen equivalence between simplicial groups and reduced simplicial sets]])**

Forming [[simplicial loop space]] objects and [[simplicial classifying spaces]] gives a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  \big(
    \Omega \dashv \overline{W}
  \big) 
  \;\colon\; 
  sGrp 
   \stackrel{\overset{}{\longleftarrow}}{\longrightarrow}
  sSet_0
$$

with the [[model structure on reduced simplicial sets]].

=--

([Goerss-Jardine 99, Chapter V, Prop. 6.3](#GoerssJardine99))


### Relation to simplicial groupoids

\begin{remark}
Forming simplicial [[delooping groupoids]] constitutes a [[fully faithful functor]] of [[1-categories]] from [[simplicial groups]] to [[sSet]]-[[enriched groupoids]] (DK-[[simplicial groupoids]]):

$$
  \array{
    sGrp &\hookrightarrow& sSet\text{-}Grpd
    \\
    \mathcal{G} &\mapsto& \mathbf{B}\mathcal{G}
    \mathrlap{\,.}
  }
$$

With respect to the above model structure (Prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnSimplicialGroups}) and the [[model structure on simplicial groupoids]], this functor clearly preserves the [[weak equivalences]] and [[fibrations]]. However, it does not have a [[left adjoint]] and thus fails to be a [[right Quillen functor]].
\end{remark}
