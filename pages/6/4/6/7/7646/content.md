
Of groups:

* [[wreath product of groups]]

* [[categorical wreath product]]

Of monads:

* [[wreath product of wreaths]] due to Lack and Street, where a [[wreath]] (in a 2-category) is, in some sense, a generalization of Beck's  [[distributive laws]]

* [[weak wreath product|weak wreath product of weak wreaths]] due to Street and Böhm, where a [[weak wreath]] (in a 2-category) is to a wreath what a [[weak distributive law]] is to a distributive law (i.e. replace unitality with something *weaker*)
