Of [[monads]]:

* [[wreath product of wreaths]] due to [Lack & Street 2002](wreath+product+of+wreaths#LackStreet02), where [[wreaths]] (in a [[2-category]]) are, in some sense, a generalization of [[distributive laws]] for [[monads]],

* [[weak wreath product of weak wreaths]] due to [Street 2009](weak+wreath+product#Street09) and [Böhm 2010](weak+wreath+product##Böhm10), where a [[weak wreath]] (in a [[2-category]]) is to a wreath what a [[weak distributive law]] is to a distributive law (i.e. replace unitality with something *weaker*)
