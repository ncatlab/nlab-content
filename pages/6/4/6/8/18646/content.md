## Idea

In the construction of ([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]] various naive mathematical constructions give rise to ill-defined "[[divergent series|divergent]]" expressions. 

Some of these occur in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that [[interaction]] points are taken _close_ to each other. Since the short distances involved in this limit translate, under [[Fourier transform]], to high [[frequencies]] encoded in the [[wave front set]] of the [[distributions]], these are called _ultraviolet divergences_. The correct way to deal with them is called _[[renormalization]]_.

Other divergences occcur in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that the spacetime [[support]] of the [[interaction]] (the support of the "[[adiabatic switching]]") tends without bounds to all of spacetime, also called the *[[adiabatic limit]]*. Since the large distances involved in this limit translate, under [[Fourier transform]], to low [[frequencies]], these are called _[[infrared divergences]]_.
