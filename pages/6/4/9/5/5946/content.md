__Daniel Murfet__ is an algebraic geometer; his PhD advisor was [[Amnon Neeman]]. Daniel keeps a blog [The Rising Sea](http://therisingsea.org) which is not very active, but hosts lots of (nice and reliable) Daniel's expositional notes (pdf files) on algebraic geometry, homological algebra and some category theory.
