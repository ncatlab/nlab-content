  > In very general terms a *halo* is a diluted or less intense component surrounding a stronger or more massive central object. Quite a few quantum systems could fit this general description, but the way the term has been applied for the last 15 years on the quantum level has been more restrictive, namely, to denote systems in which a wave-function component has an unusually large spatial extension. If this were used as the sole criterion, many systems with widely differing properties could be counted as halos, e.g., Rydberg states in atoms, and the term would lose its scientific usefulness. The tradition has been to restrict the name to a more exclusive set of structures. We shall in Sec. II consider a more precise definition of the quantum halo; it suffices here to note that tunneling into a classically forbidden region should be a pronounced feature.
