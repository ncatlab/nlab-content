## Idea

In [[graph theory]] a _pseudograph_ is a particular type of [[graph]]. A pseudograph is a [[set]] of [[vertices]] and for each unordered pair of vertices a set of [[edges]] between these.

A [[directed graph|directed]] pseudograph is also called a _[[quiver]]_.

The terminology is used in distinction to:

1. _[[multigraphs]]_, which are like pseudographs but not admitted to have "[[loops]]" in the sense of [[edges]] between a vertex and itself;

1. _[[simple graphs]]_, which are multigraphs with at most one edge between any unordered pair of distinct vertices.

Beware that the terminology is not completely consistent across different authors. Some authors may allows [[loops]] when they speak of multigraphs.
