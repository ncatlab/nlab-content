**Jacobian conjecture**: Let $k$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] of characteristics zero, $n\geq 2$ and $\phi: k^n\to k^n$ a (regular) [[endomorphism]] of $k^n$ with constant Jacobian (the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, which is in this polynomial case algebraically defined). Then $\phi$ is a regular [[automorphism]], i.e. has a polynomially defined inverse. 

The conjecture is open still stated by Keller in 1939. There were many failed attempts to prove the Jacobian conjecture, especially for $n = 2$; there are also some reductions to special cases. For example, it is known that the Jacobian conjecture holds iff it holds for $\phi$ a polynomial map of degree 3. The Jacobian conjecture is also known to hold at least for those $\phi$ which have a rational inverse.

The Jacobian conjecture is also equivalent to the Dixmier conjecture: every endomorphism of the $r$-th [[Weyl algebra]] $A_{r,k}$ over $k$ is an automorphism for all $r$. This is a statement of the article

which does contain an error in the proof, which has been later amended by others. It is actually known that each endomorphism of the $r$-th Weyl algebra is *injective*, and not known wheather it is *surjective*.
