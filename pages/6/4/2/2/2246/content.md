## Definition

A [[field]] (in the sense of [[commutative algebra]]) $F$ is **perfect** if every [[algebraic extension]] of $F$ is [[separable extension|separable]]. 


## Examples 

All fields of [[characteristic]] zero are perfect, as are all [[finite fields]], and all [[algebraically closed fields]], and all extensions of perfect fields. 

An example of a field that isn't perfect is the field of rational functions over a finite field.
