## Idea

An **exponentiable topos** is a generalization of the notion of an exponentiable [[locale]] and can be viewed as a (topological) "space" $X$ that behaves well with respect to the construction of mapping spaces $Y^X$. 

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A [[Grothendieck topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ is called _exponentiable_ (in the [[2-category]] of Grothendieck toposes $GrTop$) if the 2-functor ${}_{-}\times\mathcal{E}$ has a right 2-adjoint $(_{-})^\mathcal{E}$.
=--

## Remarks

* More concretely, $\mathcal{E}$ is exponentiable if there exists a functor $(_{-})^\mathcal{E}$ such that for all toposes $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}$ $Hom(\mathcal{F}\times\mathcal{E},\mathcal{G})$ is (naturally) equivalent as a category to $Hom(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}^\mathcal{E})$.

* The concept generalizes to [[higher topos theory]] (cf. [Anel-Lejay 2018](#AJ18), [Lurie 2018](#Lurie18)).

## Properties

Interestingly, in the category of locales exponentiability of a locale $X$ hinges on the existence of the single exponential $S^X$ where $S$ is the [[Sierpinski space]]: $Y^X$ exists for all $Y$ iff $S^X$ exists.

In $GrTop$ the [[classifying topos for the theory of objects|object classifier]] $\mathcal{S}[\mathbb{O}]$ takes over the role of the Sierpinski space and we have the following

###### Proposition
A [[Grothendieck topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ is exponentiable iff the [[exponential object|exponential]] $\mathcal{S}[\mathbb{O}]^\mathcal{E}$ exists.

This result is due to Johnstone-Joyal ([1982](#JJ82), p.282) and occurs as theorem 4.3.1 of Johnstone ([2002, vol.1 p.433](#J02)).

The following theorem pursues this analogy and generalizes a result of [[Martin Hyland]] on locales ([1981](#Hyland81)).

###### Theorem
A [[Grothendieck topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ is an exponentiable object in the 2-category of Grothendieck toposes and [[geometric morphisms]] iff $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[continuous category]].

=--

This result is due to Johnstone-Joyal ([1982](#JJ82)) and occurs as theorem 4.4.5 of Johnstone ([2002, p.748](#J02)).


## Examples

* Since [[locally finitely presentable categories]] are [[continuous category|continuous]] and [[coherent topos|coherent toposes]] are locally finitely presentable (cf. Johnstone ([2002, p.915](#J02))) it follows that _coherent toposes are exponentiable_. This can be viewed as an avatar of the fact that (locally) compact topological spaces behave well with respect to mapping spaces.

* By the same reasoning all functor categories $Set^{\mathcal{C}}$ for  $\mathcal{C}$ a [[small category]] are exponentiable since they are [[locally finitely presentable category|locally finitely presentable]]. This includes in particular all [[presheaf toposes]] on small categories.

## Ramifications

The notion of a [[tiny object]] in a cartesian closed category suggests the following

###### Definition
An exponentiable Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{E}$ is called _tiny_ (or _infinitesimal_) if the 2-functor $(_{-})^\mathcal{E}$ has a right 2-adjoint $(_{-})_\mathcal{E}$.
