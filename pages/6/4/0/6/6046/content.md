and a fully refereed online, open access journal

* [Bulletin of the Manifold Atlas](http://www.boma.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20250228132237/http://www.boma.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/))

housing refereed pages from the wiki. Pages from the wiki are subsequently independent of a published version, so can continue to develop.
