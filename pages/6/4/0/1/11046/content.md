## Idea

A [[spacetime]] which as a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] has (possibly) non-vanishing [[Riemann curvature]] is called _curved_. This corresponds to a non-trivial [[field (physics)|field]] of [[gravity]]. 

A highly symmetric example of curved spacetime is the ([[anti de Sitter spacetime|anti]]-)[[de Sitter spacetime]]. Other important examples are [[black hole]]-spacetimes. 

In contrast, a non-curved spacetime is called *flat*, the archetypical example being [[Minkowski spacetime]].
