## Idea

The concept of _[[cobordism]]_ sits at a subtle connection between [[differential topology]]/[[differential geometry]] and [[stable homotopy theory]]/[[higher category theory]], this is the content of what is often called "cobordism theory". 

The insight goes back to the seminal thesis ([Thom 54](#Thom54)), which established that the [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]] exhibits the [[cobordism ring]], whose elements are cobordism [[equivalence classes]] of [[manifolds]], as the [[homotopy groups]] of a [[spectrum]], whence called the _[[Thom spectrum]]_. 

Via the [[Brown representability theorem]], the full [[Thom spectrum]] represents a [[generalized cohomology theory]], whence called _[[cobordism cohomology theory]]_. For every kind of topological structure carried by manifolds this has a variant, such as notably [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]]. These Thom spectra and their cobordism cohomology theories play a special role in [[stable homotopy theory]], for instance for the concepts of _[[orientation in generalized cohomology]]_ and the concept of _[[genus]]_.

A more recent refinement of this statement is (the proof of)  the [[cobordism hypothesis]] which identified the ([[framed manifold|framed]]) [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] as the free [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category with duals]] on a single object.
