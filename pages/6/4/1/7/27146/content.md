Jacob Towber was an American algebraist with tenure at de Paul University at Chicago. An example of finite dimensional noncommutative [[Hopf algebra]]s is named after him (Radford's Hopf algebras) with most famous member in dimension 8. The purpose of his example originally was to  give an example of a Hopf algebra whose [[Jacobson radical]] is not a [[Hopf ideal]].
