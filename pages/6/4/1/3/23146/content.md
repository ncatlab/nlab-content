## Idea

In [[enriched category theory]], a *Bénabou cosmos* is a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{V}$ with good properties that make it a [[base of enrichment]] well-suited for $\mathcal{V}$-[[enriched category theory]]. (There are variants of this idea, see at *[[cosmos]]* for more).

The archetypical Bénabou cosmos is the category [[Set]] of all sets, equipped with its [[Cartesian product]]-monoidal structure; and $Set$-[[enriched category theory]] is the ordinary theory of [[locally small categories]], whose [[hom-sets]] are [[sets]].

The point of the notion of Bénabou cosmoi is to allow more general [[hom-objects]] than just [[sets]], while imposing enough conditions on the category $\mathcal{V}$ which these form in order that most standard definitions and proofs of plain [[category theory]] (e.g. properties of [[enriched functor categories]] and specifically of [[categories of presheaves]]) generalize to $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category theory (e.g. concerning [[enriched presheaves]]).


## Definition

\begin{definition}\label{BenabouCosmosAccordingToStreet}
A [[Bénabou cosmos]]  is ([Street 74, p. 1](#Street74)) a 

* [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] (hence [[bicomplete category|bicomplete]]) 

* [[closed monoidal category|closed]] 

* [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]

* [[monoidal category|monoidal]]

[[category]].  
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
There is a generalization of Def. \ref{BenabouCosmosAccordingToStreet} to the context of enriched [[indexed categories]] ([Shulman 2013](#Shulman13)).  While Def. \ref{BenabouCosmosAccordingToStreet} is not "[[elementary topos|elementary]]" (as it involves infinitary (non-[[finite limit|finite]]) [[limits]] and [[colimits]]), the indexed version *is* elementary, as the infinitary structure is folded into the indexing base category.  The notion of [[Bénabou cosmoi]] is recovered as particular indexed cosmoi over [[Set]].
\end{remark}


## Examples
 {#Examples}

\begin{example}\label{TopoiAreCosmoi}
**([[topoi]] are [[cosmoi]])**
\linebreak
  Every [[Grothendieck topos]] is a Bénabou cosmos, where the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] structure is [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]]. Examples in this class include:

* The archetypical such example is the category [[Set]] of [[set]]. $Set$-[[enriched categories]] are ordinary [[locally small categories]].

* The category [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]] is the [[presheaf topos]] over the [[simplex category]], whose cartesian monoidal structure is discussed at *[[products of simplicial sets]]*. $sSet$-[[enriched categories]] are often called *[[simplicial categories]]* (though see there for ambiguity in this terminology). They serve as foundation for much of [[homotopy theory]], see at *[[simplicial homotopy theory]]* and *[[simplicial model categories]]* for more. 

\end{example}

## References

Apparently there is no explicit written account by [[Jean Bénabou]] on the notion, but one finds it recounted in [Street 74, p. 1](#Street74):

> to J. Benabou the word means "bicomplete symmetric monoidal category", such categories $\mathcal{V}$ being rich enough so that the theory of categories enriched in  $\mathcal{V}$ develops to a large extent just as the theory of ordinary categories.
