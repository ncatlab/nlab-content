#Definition#

A presheaf on a category $S$ with values in a category $C$ is nothing but a functor 
$$
  S^{op} \to C
$$
from the [[opposite category]] $S^{op}$ to $C$.

#Remarks#

* One addresses such functors as presheaves if there is the structure of a [[site]] on $S$, such that it makes sense to ask if a given presheaf is actually a [[sheaf]].

* One generally useful way to think of presheaves is in the sense of [[space and quantity]].

* In the case where $C = Set$ and $S$ is [[small category|small]], an important general principle is that the category of presheaves on $S$ and [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between them is the [[free cocompletion]] of $S$.
