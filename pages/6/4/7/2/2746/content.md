I'm an assistant professor of mathematics at the [University of Nevada, Reno](http://www.unr.edu/math/).
 
My research lies on the interface between algebraic topology, geometry, and mathematical physics. I am particularly interested in the role that homotopy theoretic and higher categorical structures play in quantization.

My Ph.D thesis was on [[higher symplectic geometry]], and was supervised by [[John Baez]].
