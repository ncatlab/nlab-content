An __entourage__ (aka __vicinity__) is a [[binary relation]] of 'approximate equality' on a [[space]].  Just as a [[topological space]] is given by its [[underlying set]] of points and an appropriate collection of [[open subsets]], so a [[uniform space]] is given by its underlying set of points and an appropriate collection of entourages.  If the intuition behind open subsets is that you can take a point in an open subset, move it a small distance, and get a point in the open subset; then the intuition behind entourages is that you can take any two points related by an entourage, move them anywhere in the space as long as each is only moved a small distance relative to the other, and get two points related by the entourage.


## Examples

*  In a [[metric space]], a relation $\approx$ is an entourage if there exists a positive [[real number]] $\epsilon$ such that
   $$ d(x,y) \lt \epsilon \;\implies\; x \approx y ,$$
   where $x,y$ are points in the metric space and $d$ is the metric.

*  In a [[gauge space]], $\approx$ is an entourage if there exists an $\epsilon$ and a gauging distance $d$ such that the preceding condition holds.

*  In a [[topological abelian group]], $\approx$ is an entourage if there is a [[neighbourhood]] $N$ of the identity element such that
   $$ x/y \in N \;\implies\; x \approx_N y ,$$
   where $x,y$ are points in the metric space and $/$ is the division operation in the group.

*  In a nonabelian [[topological group]], there are two distinct notions of entourage, one using the same formula as above and the other using $y/x$ in place of $x/y$.
