## Idea

In the context of [[2-category theory]], a **cartesian closed 2-category** is a [[2-category]], $\mathcal{B}$, with [[2-limit|finite products]] and a cartesian closed structure. For any $A$, $B$ in $\mathcal{B}$, there is an exponential object $B^A$, an evaluation 1-arrow, $eval_{A, B}: B^A \times A \to B$, and for every $X$ an adjoint equivalence between $\mathcal{B}(X, B^A)$ and $\mathcal{B}(X \times A, B)$.  

The concept was introduced in ([Makkai 96](#Makkai96)). There is no connection to the concept of [[cartesian bicategory]].

## Examples

* the 2-category of generalized [[species]] ([FGHW](#FGHW)).

* the 2-category of cartesian distributors.

* the 2-category of operads.
