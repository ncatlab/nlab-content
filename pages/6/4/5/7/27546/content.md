## Idea

The *plat closure* of a [[braid]] of an [[even number]] of strands is the [[link]] obtained by connecting each consecutive [[pair]] of incoming strands and each consecutive pair of outgoing strands. 

There is a maximal [[subgroup]] $H_{2n} \subset Br_{2n}$ of the [[braid group]], called the *Hilden subgroup*, such that the plat closure is [[invariant]] under pre- & postcomposition with elements in $H_{2n}$, hence such that it descends to an operation on the [[double coset]]

$$
  PlatClosure 
    \;\colon\;
  H_{2n}\backslash Br_{2n}/H_{2n}
  \longrightarrow
  Links_{/isotopy}
  \,.
$$
This situation generalizes to [[framed braids]] whose plat closures are [[framed links]].
