There are multiple notions of *cartesian square* that are used in mathematics: 

* There is the *cartesian square* as a [[cartesian power]] in the sense that a [[square]] is a [[power]]: thus the cartesian square is another name for the [[product]] of an [[object]] with itself. 

* There is the *Cartesian square* as a square [[diagram]], where it is another term for [[pullback]] [[diagram]]. Similarly,  *homotopy cartesian square* is another term for *[[homotopy pullback]]* diagram.
