## Definition

A **constant sheaf** is a [[sheaf]] that is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[sheafification]] of a constant [[presheaf]] (a constant [[functor]]).

This notion sits in a hierarchy of related notions:

* A section of a constant sheaf is a [[locally constant function]]. 

* A section of a [[constant stack]] is a [[locally constant sheaf]].

For the full story see [[locally constant âˆž-stack]].

## Examples

* The [[natural numbers object]] in any [[Grothendieck topos]] is the constant sheaf on the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers.
