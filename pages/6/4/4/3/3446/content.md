## Definition

A **constant sheaf** is a [[sheaf]] (on some [[site]] C) that is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[sheafification]] of a constant [[presheaf]] (a constant [[functor]]).

Together with the [[global section]] functor, the constant sheaf functor is a [[geometric morphism]]

$$
  \Gamma : Sh(C) \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Set : const
$$

from the [[Grothendieck topos|sheaf topos]] to the [[topos]] [[Set]].


## Examples

* The [[natural numbers object]] in any [[Grothendieck topos]] is the constant sheaf on the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers.

## Pattern

* A [[locally constant function]] is a section of a **constant sheaf**;

* a [[locally constant sheaf]] is a section of a [[constant stack]];

* a [[locally constant stack]] is a section of (... and so on...)

* a [[locally constant ∞-stack]] is a section of a [[constant ∞-stack]].

A locally constant sheaf / $\infty$-stack is also called a [[local system]].
