The __spin group__ $Spin(n)$ is the [[universal covering space]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$. By the usual arguments it inherits a group structure for which the operations are smooth and so is a [[Lie group]] like $SO(n)$.

The spin group is one element in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$, which starts out like

$$
  \cdots \to Fivebrane(n) \to String(n) \to Spin(n) \to SO(n) \to \mathrm{O}(n)
  \,.
$$

[[fivebrane group]] to [[string group]] to **spin group** to [[special orthogonal group]] to [[orthogonal group]].

The [[homotopy group]]s of $O(n)$ are for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and for sufficiently large $n$

$$
  \array{
     \pi_{8k+0}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2
     \\
     \pi_{8k+1}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2
     \\
     \pi_{8k+2}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+3}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}
     \\
     \pi_{8k+4}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+5}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+6}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+7}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

By [[Whitehead tower|co-killing]] these groups step by step one gets

$$
  \array{
     cokill this &&&& to get
     \\
     \\
     \pi_{0}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2 &&& SO
     \\
     \pi_{1}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2 &&& Spin
     \\
     \pi_{2}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{3}(O) & = \mathbb{Z} &&& String
     \\
     \pi_{4}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{5}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{6}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{7}(O) & = \mathbb{Z} &&& Fivebrane
  }
  \,.

#Spin group in physics#

The name arises due to the requirement that the structure group of the [[tangent bundle]] of [[spacetime]] lifts to $Spin(n)$ so as to 'define particles with spin'... (Someone more awake and focused please put this into proper words!)
