To accomodate an intuitive notion of a "function of differential operator" there is a simple trick used: consider the Fourier transform. Then the differential operators become polynomials. This correspondence of operators and their symbols, is by the definition, under some analytic care can be extended to define generalizations of differential operators by suitably extending a notion of symbols. Thus [[pseudodifferential operator]]s of Kohn and Nirenberg appeared in 1965 with soon following  revolution in harmonic analysis and analysis in PDE. This includes a  further generalization, the Fourier integral operators of [[Lars Hormander|Lars HÃ¶rmander]]. A part of harmonic analysis involving such methods is called microlocal analysis.

This is clearly related to the general study of oscillating integrals, including stationary phase method and WKB-method (and generalizations) in particular. These kind of approximations and related estimates are of importance to the study of the propagation of singularities of differential equations, wave fronts, eikonal equations, and so on.

As oscillating integrals are involved in the analysis of various Green functions like the heat kernel there is also a connection to index theorems for elliptic differential operators, see H&#246;rmander's 4-volume book on analysis of linear PDEs.
