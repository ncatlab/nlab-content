To accomodate an intuitive notion of a "function of differential operator" there is a simple trick used: consider the Fourier transform. Then the differential operators become polynomials. This correspondence of operators and their symbols, is by the definition, under some analytic care can be extended to define generalizations of differential operators by suitably extending a notion of symbols. Thus [[pseudodifferential operator]]s of Kohn and Nirenberg appeared in 1965 with soon following  revolution in harmonic analysis and analysis in PDE. This includes a  further generalization, the Fourier integral operators of [[Lars Hormander|Lars Hörmander]]. A part of harmonic analysis involving geometric aspect (support, wavefront set, characteristics, wavefront set...of distributions, pseudodifferential operators and their symbols) of such methods is called **microlocal analysis**. There are more technical definitions (involving wavefront sets, supports and filtrations on the lagebras of symbols) of various "microlocal" properties of symbols: microlocalizaton, microhypoellipticity, microparametrix etc.). Some formal symmilarities are also taken in a version of filtered localization theory in noncommutative algebra, so called algebraic microlocalization, which is however not used in operator theory.

This is clearly related to the general study of oscillating integrals, including stationary phase method and WKB-method (and generalizations) in particular. These kind of approximations and related estimates are of importance to the study of the propagation of singularities of differential equations, wave fronts, eikonal equations, and so on.

As oscillating integrals are involved in the analysis of various Green functions like the heat kernel there is also a connection to index theorems for elliptic differential operators, see H&#246;rmander's 4-volume book on analysis of linear PDEs.
