[[!redirects category of categories]]

## Idea
The **elementary theory of the category of categories**, or _ETCC_ for short, is the first order axiomatics proposed by [[William Lawvere|F.W. Lawvere]] in 1963 for a category of categories as a [[foundation of mathematics|foundation for mathematics]].
