## Idea

A morphism of [[schemes]] (and more general objects, e.g., stacks) that is [[quasicompact]] and [[quasiseparated]].

## An analogue of good covers for quasicompact quasiseparated schemes

Quasicompact quasiseparated schemes are characterized by a property that they admit an analogue (of sorts) of a [[good cover]]: such schemes are precisely those schemes that can be covered by finitely many affine opens such that the intersection of any two opens can itself be covered by finitely many affine opens.
