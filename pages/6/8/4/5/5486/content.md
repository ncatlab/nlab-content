The __Morse--Kelley set theory__ ($MK$) is an axiomatic approach to [[set theory]] which has both [[classes]] and [[sets]].  Whereas [[NBG]] (which also has both classes and sets) is [[conservative extension|conservative]] over [[ZFC]], Morse--Kelley is not a conservative extension of $NBG$. The principal difference from $NBG$ is that $MK$ allows arbitrary formulas $\phi$ appearing in the class [[axiom of specification|comprehension axiom schema]] (in particular, formulae with quantifiers ranging over classes themselves).

The approach is explained in the appendix to [[John Kelley]]'s 1955 book _General Topology_.
