The __Morse-Kelley set theory__ is an axiomatic approach to [[set theory]] which has both [[classes]] and [[sets]] as in [[NBG]] approach, but unlike NBG which is [[conservative extension|conservative]] over [[ZFC]], Morse-Kelley is not a conservative extension of NBG. The principal difference from NBG is that it allows arbitrary formula $\phi$ appearing in the class comprehension axiom schema (in particular, formulae with quantifiers ranging over classes themselves).

The approach is explained in the appendix to J. L. Kelley's 1955 book _General topology_.
