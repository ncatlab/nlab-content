A **pretopos** is a [[coherent category]] which is both [[extensive category|extensive]] and [[exact category|exact]].  (See [[familial regularity and exactness]] for why extensivity and exactness deserve to be considered together.)  Frequently one is interested in _Heyting pretoposes_, or pretoposes which are also [[Heyting category|Heyting categories]].

Like any coherent category, a (Heyting) pretopos has an [[internal logic]].  Extensivity and exactness make a Heyting pretopos a very set-like category.  One can say imprecisely that it has "all the good first-order properties of a [[topos]];" that is, all the good properties except the existence of exponentials and power objects.  Therefore, Heyting pretoposes (often [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]] ones) are related to [[predicativism|predicative mathematics]] in a way similar to how toposes are related to [[constructivism|intuitionistic mathematics]].

A pretopos is necessarily [[balanced category|balanced]], but while it has coproducts and coequalizers of equivalence relations, it need not have all finite colimits.  However, if it has countable pullback-stable unions of subobjects, then any internal binary relation generates an equivalence relation and therefore has a quotient, so we can construct arbitrary coequalizers and thus arbitrary finite colimits.

## Infinitary pretoposes ##

An **infinitary pretopos** is an [[coherent category|infinitary coherent category]] which is both [[extensive category|infinitary extensive]] and [[exact category|exact]].  Giraud's theorem says that infinitary pretoposes with small generating sets are the same as [[Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck toposes]], and in particular are [[topos|toposes]].
