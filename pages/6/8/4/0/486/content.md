## Definitions

A __pretopos__ is a [[coherent category]] which is both [[extensive category|extensive]] and [[exact category|exact]].  (See [[familial regularity and exactness]] for why extensivity and exactness deserve to be considered together.)


Frequently one is especially interested in pretoposes having additional properties, such as:

* A __Heyting pretopos__ is a pretopos which is also a [[Heyting category]]; a __Boolean pretopos__ is a pretopos which is also a [[Boolean category]].  These are suitable as frameworks for [[finite mathematics|finitist]] [[predicative mathematics]], respectively with [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] or [[classical logic|classical]] logic.
* A __$\Pi$-pretopos__ is a pretopos which is also a [[locally cartesian closed category]].  (A $\Pi$-pretopos is automatically a Heyting pretopos.)  These are suitable as frameworks for finitist [[constructive mathematics]] which is 'weakly predicative'.
* A __$W$-pretopos__ is a pretopos which has (locally) [[inductive object]]s ([[initial algebra|initial]] [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebras]] for [[polynomial endofunctor]]s), most famously a [[natural numbers object]].  Heyting $W$-pretoposes and Boolean $W$-pretoposes are suitable as frameworks for non-finitist predicative mathematics.
* A __$\Pi$-$W$-pretopos__ is a $\Pi$-pretopos that has all [[W-types]].  (Every $\Pi$-$W$-pretopos is both a $\Pi$-pretopos and a $W$-pretopos, but the converse seems to fail.)  These are suitable as frameworks for weakly predicative constructive mathematics that is not finitist.
* A __[[topos]]__ is a pretopos that has [[power objects]].  A topos is automatically a $\Pi$-pretopos; conversely, a $\Pi$-pretopos is a topos iff it has a [[subobject classifier]], and a Boolean $\Pi$-pretopos is always a topos.  Toposes and [[Boolean toposes]] are suitable as frameworks for finitist (but otherwise impredicative) mathematics, with intuitionistic and classical logic respectively.
* A __$W$-topos__ is of course a topos that is a $W$-pretopos; it is sufficient that the topos have a [[natural numbers object]] (see van den Berg & Moerdijk), so this is often called a __topos with NNO__.  These are suitable as frameworks for (non-predicative, non-finitist) [[constructive mathematics]], while Boolean $W$-toposes are suitable as a framework for [[classical mathematics]] without the [[axiom of choice]].
* A __topos with choice__ is a topos that satisfies the [[axiom of choice]] (that every [[epimorphism]] is [[split epic|split]]).  Every topos with choice is automatically boolean, so $W$-toposes with choice are suitable as a framework for full classical mathematics.  (In fact, a [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] $W$-topos with choice is precisely a model of [[ETCS]].)


## Internal logic and mathematics in pretopoi

Like any coherent (or Heyting) category, a (Heyting) pretopos has an [[internal logic]].  Extensivity and exactness make a Heyting pretopos a very set-like category.  One can say imprecisely that it has "all the good first-order properties of a [[topos]]", meaning not that it has those properties that can be expressed in elementary terms (which is false) but that it has those properties that (unlike exponential and power objects) correspond to first-order reasoning in ordinary mathematics.  Therefore, pretoposes (especially Heyting, $\Pi$, and/or $W$ ones) are related to predicative constructive mathematics in a way similar to how toposes are related to non-predicative constructive mathematics.


## Colimits

A pretopos is necessarily [[balanced category|balanced]], but while it has coproducts and coequalizers of equivalence relations, it need not have all finite colimits.  However, if it has countable pullback-stable unions of subobjects, then any internal binary relation generates an equivalence relation and therefore has a quotient, so we can construct arbitrary coequalizers and thus arbitrary finite colimits.  And we can perform an "internal" version of this argument in a $\Pi$-pretopos with a [[natural numbers object|NNO]], such as a $\Pi$-$W$-pretopos.


## The precanonical topology

A pretopos, being a [[coherent category]], admits a [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] [[Grothendieck topology]] called the [[coherent topology]].  In a pretopos, this topology is generated by finite jointly epimorphic families.  Since the [[canonical topology]] on a [[Grothendieck topos]] consists of all jointly epimorphic families, the coherent topology on a pretopos is sometimes called the __precanonical topology__.

The [[codomain fibration]] of a pretopos is always a [[stack]] for its precanonical topology.  Being a pretopos is stronger than necessary for this condition to hold in a coherent category, however; see [[coherent category]] for the necessary and sufficient conditions.


## Infinitary pretoposes ##

An __infinitary pretopos__ is an [[infinitary coherent category]] which is both [[infinitary extensive category|infinitary extensive]] and [[exact category|exact]].  Giraud\'s theorem says that infinitary pretoposes with small generating sets are the same as [[Grothendieck toposes]], and in particular are [[toposes]] (although this last result is not valid in [[predicative mathematics]]).
