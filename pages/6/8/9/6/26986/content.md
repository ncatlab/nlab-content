## Idea

The *ergodic decomposition theorem* says that, under some conditions, every [[invariant measure]] is a [[mixture]] of [[ergodic measure|ergodic ones]]. 

[[category-theoretic approaches to probability theory|In terms of category theory]], the statement can be often expressed in terms of a categorical [[limit]].


## Statement of the theorem

(...)


## Examples

* [[De Finetti's theorem]] together with the [[Hewitt-Savage zero-one law]] can be seen as an instance of the ergodic decomposition theorem, where the [[action]] is given by [[exchangeability|finite permutations]].
