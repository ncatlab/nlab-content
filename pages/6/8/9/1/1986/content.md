[[!include all changes]]


All non-trivial additions or changes to the $n$Lab should briefly be indicated here. This way [[Contributors|the rest of us]] can spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

+-- {: .standout}

Please log all your non-trivial changes to the $n$Lab here!

=--

Here "non-trivial" means: anything that any other contributor might be interested in taking notice of. If you fix a trivial typo in the text somewhere, that is highly appreciated but unlikely to be controversial and hence need not be logged here. But already if you fix a typo in some _formula_, it may be of interest. Generally: the more you log your activity here, the better. Even when in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in changes you made, drop a note here on what you did.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list.

Added links to [[mathematics]], [[algebra]] and maybe to some more entry(s).

*  [[John Baez]]: Why does the main front page look so weird?  Did the site get moved to a new host, or is it the result of an alien invasion?
   
   * Hmm, now it's back to normal.

   * [[Urs Schreiber]]: I can't tell what happened. Andrew is indeed preparing the migration and has set up the nLab on another server by now. That shouldn't affect what's going on here. Or might it be that the phenomenon was something just on your side? What was it actually?

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I was thinking of writing articles on $\Omega$-[[Omega-group|groups]] and [[Malcev variety|Мальцев varieties]] to talk about [[ideals]] in them.  I agree that three articles, one on that subject, one on ideals in
