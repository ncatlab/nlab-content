[[!include all changes]]


All non-trivial additions or changes to the $n$Lab should briefly be indicated here. This way [[Contributors|the rest of us]] can spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

+-- {: .standout}

Please log all your non-trivial changes to the $n$Lab here!

=--

Here "non-trivial" means: anything that any other contributor might be interested in taking notice of. If you fix a trivial typo in the text somewhere, that is highly appreciated but unlikely to be controversial and hence need not be logged here. But already if you fix a typo in some _formula_, it may be of interest. Generally: the more you log your activity here, the better. Even when in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in changes you made, drop a note here on what you did.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] is adding [[boolean domain]], [[boolean function]], and [[boolean-valued function]] --- according to his custom starting with a middling level of abstraction that comes up a lot in pedagogy and practice and is calculated to avoid scaring too many children and horses.

* [[Zoran Å koda]] created [[locally convex space]] and additions to [[topological vector space]]; the latter wasted an additional one hour or so because the server was not accepting the input but sending internal application error messages for some reason which according to many tries seemed to have originated in some characters in formulas in previous (Toby's text) it seems as only after changing his formulas it worked and removing my own paragraphs did not help, but who knows which combination of mine and earlier text is actually bugging the system. The repeated trials or removing and adding text took more time than necessary because of the old problem with nlab default that nlab rejects the submition if it is 4th subsequent trial without refreshing edit view from within show view (hence back button not allowed more than 3 times in a row). I think the default should be put to 10 or so, as I often hit over 3 submits from the text which I edit and do not want to wait (and also fight and pay slow internet when on wireless) to go back to show view and then again to ask for another edit: my mozilla keeps the old edit and I can go back to the text immeditaly if the submit was unsucessful or if I notice I do not like the outcome. Thus when server is slow I can reedit what I was editing 5 seconds ago instanteneously without repressing the edit and waiting for the server which may fail again. I think 10 resubmits within the frame could be a better deafult than 3. Created entries [[Fourier analysis]] and [[Pontrjagin dual]]. Yesterday wrote few lines in [[functional analysis]] but on the submit the loss of connection lost it; I'll try again today. 

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added [[multigrade operator]] and [[parametric operator]].  Added the missing Figures to [[minimal negation operator]] but didn't know how to scale them here --- 80% or 500px would probably be good.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Edited [[nonstandard analysis]] a bit.  Grammatically, I changed 'infinitesimally small' to 'infinitesimal', which already means 'infinitely small' (in absolute value).

   *  Added a lot to [[graph]].
   *  Regarding [[SVGsandbox]], note also [[SVG Sandbox]] and [[Inclusion Sandbox]].
   *  Formatted [[minimal negation operator]], where [[Jon Awbrey]] has put material; note that there are two missing diagrams.
   *  Cross linked [[subfunctor]] and [[sieve]].
