## Idea

Projective spectrum Proj assigns a locally ringed space $Proj(A)$ to a graded ring $A$. This construction has been introduced by Serre.

Serre proved two elementary theorems concerning the structure of sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules on $X = Proj(A)$ relating graded modules over $A$ and [[quasicoherent sheaves]] over $X$: one on coherent and another on quasicoherent sheaves. In both cases, quasicoherent sheaves correspond to objects in the localization of a category of graded modules by a torsion (Serre's) subcategory.

There is an analogue for affine schemes, (affine) [[affine Serre's theorem|Serre's theorem on quasicoherent sheaves over affine schemes]]. 

## Serre's theorem, quasicoherent version

There is a functor $M\mapsto \tilde{M}$ (todo: should be described here) from the category of graded modules over a $\mathbf{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded ring $A$ to the category of quasicoherent sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules on $X = Proj(A)$ which has a fully faithful right adjoint, hence inducing an equivalence of the category of quasicoherent modules $qcoh(X)$ with a localization of the category of graded $A$-modules. The kernel of that localization is the subcategory of modules of finite length.

## Serre's theorem, coherent version

If $A$ is Noetherian the functor $M\mapsto \tilde{M}$ restricted to the category of finitely generated projective modules takes values in the category of coherent sheaves and the induced functor also has a fully faithful right adjoint, which moreover induces an equivalence between the localization of the category of finitely generated projective $A$-modules by the Serre's subcategory of modules of finite length and the category of coherent sheaves over $Proj(A)$.

## Noncommutative and derived analogues

The subject of noncommutative projective algebraic geometry by Artin and Zhang, as well as independent (and different mainly in the level of generality) attempts to 
noncommutative geometry by other authors take the Serre's
theorem to the status of definition of the category of quasicoherent sheaves when the graded ring is generalized to a noncommutative one.
