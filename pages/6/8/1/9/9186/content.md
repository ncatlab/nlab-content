## Definition

The [[connected component]] of the [[subgroup]] of [[outer automorphisms]] of the [[super Poincaré group]] (in some dimension) which fixes the underlying [[Poincaré group]] is called its _R-symmetry_ group.

When realizing [[supergravity]] theories by [[KK-compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] then R-symmetry arises from residual [[isometries]] of the compactificaiton space. 

In [[gauged supergravity]], in turn, part of the [[global symmetry|global]] R-symmetry is promoted to an actual [[gauge group]].

For instance the $SO(8)$ R-symmetry and gauging of [[4d supergravity]] may be understood geometrically by compactification of 11d supergravity on an $S^7$ fiber (e.g. [de Wit 02, section 5](#deWit02)).
