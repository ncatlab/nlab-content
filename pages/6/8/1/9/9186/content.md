## Definition

The [[connected component]] of the [[subgroup]] of [[outer automorphisms]] of the [[super Poincaré group]] (in some given dimension for some real [[spin representation]] ("[[number of supersymmetries]]")) which fixes the underlying [[Poincaré group]] is called its _R-symmetry_ group (e.g. [de Wit 02, p. 5-6](#deWit02)).

So these are transformations acting on just the [[spinors]], leaving the vectors alone, such that in particular the super-bracket which pairs spinors to vectors remains invariant.

For the real [[spin representations]] in dimension 3,4 and 6 which are induced by the [[normed division algebra]] $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}$, respectively (see at _[[division algebra and supersymmetry]]_) and for $N$ supersymmetries (i.e. the spin representation being the [[direct sum]] of $N$ copies of a real irrep) then the R-symmetry group at least includes the $N \times N$ $\mathbb{A}$-[[unitary matrices]] ([Varadarajan 04, section 6.7](#Varadarajan04)).

Geometrically, when realizing [[supergravity]] theories by [[KK-compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] then this R-symmetry may be thought of as arising from residual [[isometries]] of the compactification space. 

In [[gauged supergravity]], in turn, part of the [[global symmetry|global]] R-symmetry is promoted to an actual [[gauge group]].

For instance the $SO(8)$ R-symmetry and gauging of [[4d supergravity]] (...say which version...) may be understood geometrically by compactification of 11d supergravity on an $S^7$ fiber (e.g. [de Wit 02, section 5](#deWit02)).
