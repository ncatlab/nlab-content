## Idea

A _conformal net_ is a central structure appearing in [[conformal field theory]]: it is the specialization of the [[AQFT]]-notion of a [[local net]] of algebras of observables from general [[quantum field theory]].

## References

Standard [[AQFT]] references on conformal nets include

* [[Roberto Longo]], _Conformal Subnets and Intermediate Subfactors_ ([arXiv:0102196](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0102196))

and lots of others...

A somewhat novel take on conformal nets is presented and studied in 

* [[Arthur Bartels]], [[Andre Henriques]], [[Chris Douglas]], _Conformal nets and local field theory_ ([arXiv:0912.5307](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5307))

where conformal nets are arranged into a [[tricategory]]  with [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]] that is a [[delooping]] of the [[bicategory]] of [[von Neumann algebra]]s and [[bimodule]]s between these. Among other things, this work connects the [[AQFT]] notion of conformal nets with the [[FQFT]] notion of [[cobordism]] representations.
