## Idea

Overlap algebras are one possible constructive version
of [[complete Boolean algebras]].
In the presence of [[excluded middle]],
the category of overlap algebras
is equivalent to the category of [[complete Boolean algebras]]
and continuous homomorphisms.

However, in the absence of [[excluded middle]],
the [[powerset]] of a [[set]] is no longer a [[complete Boolean algebra]],
but it is an overlap algebra.

## Definition

(See Definition 2.1 in \cite{OA}.)

An __overlap algebra__ is an [[overt]] [[frame]] $L$
such that if for all $z\in L$ the positivity of $z\wedge x$
implies the positivity of $z\wedge y$,
then we have $x\le y$.

Morphisms of overlap algebras are precisely
[[open]] morphisms of [[frames]].

Thus, in the presence of [[excluded middle]]
the category of overlap algebras is equivalent
to the category of [[complete Boolean algebras]],
see Proposition 5.2 in \cite{OA}.

## Properties

In the presence of [[excluded middle]],
overlap algebras coincide with [[complete Boolean algebras]].
(Proposition 2.2 and Proposition 5.2 in \cite{OA}.)
