## Idea

The traditional notion of *[[connection on a principal bundle]]* with given [[structure group|structure]] [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ has a slick [[dg-algebra|dg-algebraic]]-formulation in terms of the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ and the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ (due to [Henri Cartan 1950](Weil+algebra#Cartan50)). 

These concepts of *[[Cartan connection]]* may be generalized to [[L-infinity algebras|$L_\infty$-algebras]] (originally so in [SSS09](#SSS09), [SSS12](#SSS12), [FSS12](#FSS12), which was the starting point for the more comprehensive development in [dcct12](#dcct12)) -- see at *[[connection on a smooth principal infinity-bundle|connection on a smooth principal $\infty$-bundle]]*. In fact, noticing (see [here](L-infinity-algebra#ReformulationInTermsOfSemifreeDGAlgebra)) that the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]-construction $CE(-)$ constitutes a [[full subcategory]]-embedding of the 1-category of [[finite type]] [[L-infinity algebras|$L_\infty$-algebras]] into the [[opposite category|opposite 1-category]] of [[dgc-algebras]], there is an immediate $L_\infty$-analog of the notion of [[Weil algebra]] ([SSS09, Def. 16](#SSS09)).

However, this is a [[1-category|1-]][[category theory|category theoretic]] analog, hence is a particularly strict model, defined up to [[isomorphism]], of what the would-be $\infty$-Weil algebra of an $L_\infty$-algebra should be. The latter will only be well-defined up to compatible [[quasi-isomorphism]]. 

The need to pass to compatible deformations of $L_\infty$-Weil algebras for a satisfactory definition of [[string 2-connections]] ([[1-brane]] connections) and analogous higher notions ([[fivebrane structure|5-brane]]-connection, [[ninebrane structure|9-brane]], etc.) was first discussed around [SSS09, Prop. 21](#SSS09) (and used to exhibit the [[higher gauge theory|higher gauge-theoretic]] nature of the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] in [SSS12, §3.2](higher+gauge+theory+of+the+Green-Schwarz+mechanism+--+references#SatiSchreiberStasheff12)), and was justified there by the condition that the canonical [[invariant polynomial]] in that situation does lift as expected. 

A more general discussion of the necessary *adjustments* of $L_\infty$-Weil algebras was then given in [Saemann & Schmidt 20](#SaemannSchmidt20), who observe that a good general condition to impose is that the induced [[BRST complex|BRST complexes]] of $L_\infty$-connections ([SSS09, §9.3](#SSS09)) remain well-defined when the [[antifields]] and [[auxiliary fields]] are required to strictly vanish. 
These authors introduce the terminology *adjusted Weil algebras* ([Saemann & Schmidt 20, Def. 4.2](#SaemannSchmidt20)) and the resulting *adjusted $L_\infty$-connections* and *adjusted [[higher parallel transport]]* ([Kim & Saemann 2020](KimSaemann20)). 

Concretely, the choice of compatible deformation of the Weil algebra determines the [[Bianchi identities]] on the [[curvature characteristic forms]] of corresponding [[L-infinity algebra valued differential forms|$L_\infty$-algebra valued differential forms]] (these [[Bianchi identities]] are embodied by the [[differential]] in the Weil algebra restricted to shifted generators) and without adjustment the Bianchi identities are stronger than (i.e. just special cases of what) they ought to be.

Notice that, while the [[Weil algebra]] by itself is [[contractible homotopy type]], its *adjustments* along [[quasi-isomorphisms]] must satisfy [[horizontal differential form|horizontality]] constraints (such as the vanishing of those [[antifields]]) which makes this a non-trivial procedure. 

While the characterization of adjusted Weil algebras for $L_\infty$-algebra in [Saemann & Schmidt 20, Def. 4.2](#SaemannSchmidt20) clearly (generalizes and) conceptually improves on [SSS09, Prop. 21](#SSS09), and while in applications it clearly gives the right answers (the correct higher [[Bianchi identities]]), what is still missing is a purely [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] justification. Since in practice these adjusted Weil algebras behave and are used much like [[resolutions]] by [[minimal fibrations]] in [[model category]]-theory, it is natural to wonder if there is the structure of a [[homotopical category|homotopical]] [[fibration category]] on the Weil algebra choices for $L_\infty$-algebras, such that this is indeed the case. This question is open.

On the other hand, [Borsten, Kim & Saemann 2021](#BorstenKimSaemann21) argue that adjustment is naturally understood after embedding [[L-infinity algebras|$L_\infty$-algebras]] within [[EL-infinity algebra|$E L_\infty$-algebras]] (and that this is what exhibits [[tensor hierarchies]] as a [[higher gauge theory]]-phenomenon).
