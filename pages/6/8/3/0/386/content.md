#Idea#

The **simplex category** $\Delta$ encodes one of the main [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. Its objects are the standard cellular $n$-[[simplex|simplices]].


#Definition#

* The __simplex category__ $\Delta$ is the full [[subcategory]] of [[Cat]] consisting of the finite linear [[quiver]]s.

* Equivalently: $\Delta$ is the category of finite [[totally ordered set]]s and order-preserving functions between them.

* Equivalently, the simplex category $\Delta$ may be described as the initial strict monoidal category equipped with a monoid. This style of definition also opens up the possibility of using string diagrams to visualize the structure of $\Delta$ and of the [[cube category]] $\Box$. 

#Remarks#

Sometimes, one may wish to restrict to the category $\dot{\Delta}$ consisting of *occupied* (non-empty) such.
