The __simplex category__ $\Delta$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] consisting of the finite linear [[quiver]]s.

Equivalently: $\Delta$ is the category of finite [[totally ordered set]]s and order-preserving functions between them.

Sometimes, one may wish to restrict to the category $\dot{\Delta}$ consisting of *occupied* (non-empty) such.
