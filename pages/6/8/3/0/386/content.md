#Idea#

The **simplex category** $\Delta$ encodes one of the main [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. Its objects are the standard cellular $n$-[[simplex|simplices]].


#Definition#

* The __simplex category__ $\Delta$ is the full [[subcategory]] of [[Cat]] consisting of the finite linear [[quiver]]s.

* Equivalently: $\Delta$ is the category of finite [[totally ordered set]]s and order-preserving functions between them.

* Equivalently, the simplex category $\Delta$ may be described as the initial strict monoidal category equipped with a monoid. This style of definition also opens up the possibility of using string diagrams to visualize the structure of $\Delta$ and of the [[cube category]] $\Box$. 

#Remarks#

Sometimes, one may wish to restrict to the category $\dot{\Delta}$ consisting of *occupied* (non-empty) simplices.

[[Todd Trimble|Todd]] _says_: Historically, and especially for algebraic topologists, $\Delta$ refers to the category of nonempty totally ordered sets and order-preserving maps; an adjective like "augmented" would be attached to "simplicial object" if they wanted to refer to a contravariant functor coming out of what is being defined here as $\Delta$. While I understand arguments why one might wish to redefine $\Delta$ this way, there are also countervailing arguments (cf. Tom's Caf&#233; post How I Came to Love the Nerve Construction); in any event, given the weight of history, the "sometimes" strikes me as inappropriate understatement. I think more discussion is called for before we appropriate $\Delta$ for the lesser-used concept, and rename the more commonly used one as $\Delta$ with a dot over it (do other people use that notation?).
