In the _groupoid approach to quantization_

* Eli Hawkins, _A groupoid approach to quantization_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.SG/0612363))

symplectic groupoids are the right tool for thinking about [[geometric quantization]] not of [[symplectic manifold]]s but of just [[Poisson manifold]]s.

A _**symplectic groupoid** in this context is something like a [[groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] the [[category]] of [[symplectic manifold]]s
