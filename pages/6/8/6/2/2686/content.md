#Idea#

A [[Poisson manifold]] may be thought of as a [[Lie algebroid]] with extra structure: called an [[n-symplectic manifold]] for $n = 1$.

By [[Lie integration]] this Lie algebroid should integrate to a [[Lie groupoid]] with extra structure. Symplectic groupoids are supposed to be these objects that integrate [[n-symplectic manifold]] aka [[Poisson manifold]]s in this sense.

symplectic groupoids are the right tool for thinking about [[geometric quantization]] not of [[symplectic manifold]]s but of just [[Poisson manifold]]s.

A _**symplectic groupoid** in this context is something like a [[groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] the [[category]] of [[symplectic manifold]]s
