## Definition

Given a [[monoid]] (or [[semigroup]]) $M$ and an element $a \in M$, a __left principal ideal__ in $M$ is a [[subset]] $M a$ of $M$ such that for all $m \in M$, $m a \in M a$.  Similarly, a __right principal ideal__ in $M$ is a [[subset]] $a M$ of $M$ such that for all $m \in M$, $a m \in a M$.  Finally, a __two-sided principal ideal__, or simply __principal ideal__, in $M$ is a subset $\langle a \rangle$ that is both a left ideal and a right ideal.
