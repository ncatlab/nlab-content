## Idea

A square [[matrix]] is called a _permutation matrix_ if every row and every column has all entries 0 except for precisely one entry, which has value 1 (a special case of [[monomial matrices]]).

Permutation matrices represent [[linear permutation representations]] in their canonical [[linear basis]].
