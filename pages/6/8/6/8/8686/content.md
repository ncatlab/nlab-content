## Statement

Given a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ which is [[flat module|flat]] as a $k$-[[module]] over a [[commutative ring|commmutative ground ring]] $k\supset\mathbb{Q}$ containing the [[rational numbers|rationals]], consider the [[universal enveloping algebra]] $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})=\cup_{i= 0}^\infty U^i(g)$ as a [[filtered algebra]] and a [[Hopf algebra]], where $g$ is the subspace of [[primitive elements]]. 

The __Poincar&#233;&#8211;Birkhoff&#8211;Witt theorem__ (often abbreviated to PBW theorem) says that the [[associated graded algebra]] is canonically [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[symmetric algebra]] $Sym(g)$ as an algebra, and the projection $U(g)\to Gr U(g)\cong Sym(g)$ is an  isomorphism of $k$-[[coalgebras]].  

The fact that associated graded algebra is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra is a weak form of the theorem and it is usually proved either by very explicit and long calculation constructing certain representation or by application of the [[zoranskoda:diamond lemma]]. The induced Poisson structure on $Sym(g)$ is the linear Poisson structure for the corresponding $g$.
