Ensifer is a self-proclaimed historian of mathematics, with particular interests in category theory and algebraic geometry. He is planning a scientific biography of Alexander Grothendieck (titled _Mowing and Sowing_).

Ensifer considers Jean Dieudonn&#233; an ideal historian of mathematics; and he strives to write a history of the whole of mathematics (the intended title being _Canons and Giants_) similar in spirit to what Dieudonn&#233; wrote of algebraic and differential topology, algebraic geometry, and functional analysis.

Ensifer also intends a campanion to _Canons and Giants_ which provides mathematical backgrounds (the intended title being _Tractatus Matheseos_, Latin for _Treatise on Mathematics_).

Ensifer benefits a lot form nLab when preparing drafts for TM and his special thanks go to Urs Schreiber for his bring this site into existence.
