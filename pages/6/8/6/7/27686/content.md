Given a [[complete quadrangle]] and a line $p$ in the same plane, consider the 6 points of intersection of sides of the quadrangle with the line $p$. 

Pappus' involution theorem is a result in projective geometry stating that in the above situation there is a projective involution (a projective automorphism which is also an involution) which interchanges each of the intersections of a side of the quadrangle with $p$ with the intersection of the opposite side of the quadrangle with $p$.

This projective map is not a perspectivity but a composition of two perspectivities.
