## Idea

In [[particle physics]] and specifically within [[effective field theories]] such as [[quantum hadrodynamics]], the _form factor_ of a given [[bound state]] is the [[ratio]] of its actual [[differential cross section]] for a given [[scattering]] process, by that of an actually pointlike particle
