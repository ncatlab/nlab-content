## Idea

A [[random variable]] is called *deterministic* if it happens to be non-random ("[[red herring principle]]") in that it does not actually depend on the given [[event (in probability theory)|events]], hence if it is a [[constant function]] on the underlying [[measure space]]/[[probability space]] (or at least takes a fixed value [[almost surely]]).

## Properties

\begin{remark}
  The [[law of a random variable|law]] of a deterministic random variable is a [[Dirac measure]].
\end{remark}
