[[!redirects p-exact category]]

##Idea
Loosely speaking a **Puppe exact category** is an [[abelian category]] without additivity. The subsisting exactness properties permit a considerable amount of homology theory.

Introduced by [[Dieter Puppe|D. Puppe]] in the early 1960s as a weakening of abelian categories, their homology theory was studied by [[Barry Mitchell|B. Mitchell]] in his textbook on category theory. They were extensively used by [[Marco Grandis|M. Grandis]] in his work on distributive homological algebra in the 1980s.

##Remark

Grandis worked on further generalizations that he called semi-exact or homological. This family differs from the concepts around [[semi-abelian categories]] studied in particular in the monograph by [[Dominique Bourn|Bourn]] and [[Francis Borceux|Borceux]] with respect to the existence of finite limits in the latter. Grandis (2010) proposes to view the difference as akin to the difference between projective and affine spaces.


##Definition

A [[well-powered categroy|well-powered]] category $\mathcal{C}$ is called _Puppe exact_ (, or _p-exact_ for short,) iff 

* $\mathcal{C}$ has a [[zero object]].

* $\mathcal{C}$ has [[kernels]] and [[cokernels]].

* every mono is a kernel and every epi is a cokernel.

* every morphism has an [[factorization system|epi-mono factorization]].
