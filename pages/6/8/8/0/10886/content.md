## Idea

The notion of _homotopy spectral sequence_ adapts the notion of _[[spectral sequence]]_ from [[homological algebra]]/[[stable homotopy theory]] to unstable/[[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] [[homotopy theory]]. 

Where a [[spectral sequence]] consists of [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] in an [[abelian category]] -- which typically come from the ([[cohomology group|co-]])[[homology groups]] of a ([[cochain complex|co-]])[[chain complex]] or generally from the  [[homotopy groups]] of a [[stable homotopy type]] -- the notion of homotopy spectral sequence is modeled on the [[homotopy groups]] of ([[pointed object|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]]/[[homotopy types]] which in the lowest two degrees consist instead of [[nonabelian groups]] and ([[pointed sets|pointed]]) [[sets]].

## Examples

The classical and motivating examples of a homotopy spectral sequence is the [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence]] which computes [[homotopy groups]] of a [[topological space]]/[[simplicial set]]/[[homotopy type]] realized as the [[totalization]] of a [[cosimplicial homotopy type]]. It may be regarded as the unstable analog of the [[Adams spectral sequence]], which computes homotopy groups of certain [[spectra]]. The corresponding [[spectral sequence]] for [[homology groups]] of the totalization of a [[cosimplicial homotopy type]] is the [[Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence]].
