## Idea


The [[stabilization]]/[[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^\infty  Maps(X,A)$ of  [[mapping spaces]] $Maps(X,A)$ between suitable [[CW-complexes]] $X, A$ happens to decompose as a [[direct sum]] of [[spectra]] (a [[wedge sum]]) in a useful way, related to the expression of the [[Goodwillie derivatives]] of the functor $Maps(X,-)$ and often expressible in terms of the [[configuration space (mathematics)|configuration spaces]] of $X$.
