## Definition

An __$H$-space__ ("H" for [[Heinz Hopf|Hopf]], as in _[[Hopf construction]]_) is a [[magma]] [[internalization|internal to]] the [[classical homotopy category]] of [[topological spaces]] [[Ho(Top)]], or in the homotopy category $Ho(Top)_*$ of [[pointed topological spaces]],  which has a [[unit]] up to [[homotopy]]. 

Similarly:

An **[[H-monoid|$H$-monoid]]** is a [[monoid object]] in [[Ho(Top)]], hence an $H$-space is an $H$-monoid if the product of the magma is [[associativity|associative]] up to [[homotopy]]. 

An __$H$-group__ is a [[group object]] in [[Ho(Top)]], so an $H$-monoid is an $H$-group if it also has [[inverses]] up to homotopy.

An **$H$-ring** is a [[ring object]] in (pointed) [[Ho(Top)]].

To continue in this pattern, one could say that an **[[H-category]]** is a category internal to [[Ho(Top)]].

Notice that here the homotopies for units, associativity etc. are only required to _exist_ for an H-space, not required to be equipped with higher [[coherence|coherent]] homotopies. An $H$-monoid equipped with such higher and coherent homotopies  is instead called a _strongly homotopy associative_ space or  _$A_\infty$-[[A-infinity space|space]]_ for short.  If it has only higher homotopies up to level $n$, it is called an $A_n$-[[A-n space|space]].

A better name for an $H$-space might be be $H$-[[unitoid]], but it is rarely used. The $H$ stands for [[Heinz Hopf]], and reflects the sad fact that the natural name 'homotopy group' was [[homotopy group|already occupied]]; Hopf and A. Borel found necessary algebraic conditions for a space to admit an $H$-space structure.

There are dual notions of $H$-counitoid (or $H'$-space, or [[co-H-space]]), $H$-comonoid (or $H'$-monoid) and $H$-[[cogroup]] (or $H'$-group) having co-operations with the usual identities up to homotopy. 

## Examples

### Loop spaces

The main example of an $H$-group is the [[loop space]] $\Omega X$ of a space $X$, which however is naturally even an [[A-infinity space]]. 

### Suspensions

The main example of an [[co-H-space|H-cogroup]] in $Top_*$ is the [[suspension]] $S X= S^1\wedge X$ of a pointed topological space $X$. 

### Spheres

The only [[n-spheres]] $S^n$ which have $H$-space structure are those for $n = 0,1,3,7$, and their H-space structure is given by identifying them as the unit spheres in one of the four [[normed division algebras]] ([[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], [[quaternions]], [[octonions]]) and taking the product to be that induced by the algebra product. 

An example of an H-space that does not lift to an [[A-infinity space]] is the [[7-sphere]] $S^7$. It can't be delooped because its [[delooping]] would have [[cohomology group]] a [[polynomial ring]] on a generator in degree 8, and this is impossible by mod $p$ [[Steenrod operations]] for any odd $p$, see [Lemma 2, Adams61](#Adams61). The 7-sphere is also not an $H$-group.

### Mapping spaces into H-groups

If $K$ is an $H$-group then for any topological space $X$, the set of [[homotopy classes]] $[X,K]$ has a natural group structure in the strict sense; analogously if $K'$ is an $H$-cogroup then $[K',X]$ has a group structure. If there is more than one $H$-group structure on a space, then the induced group structures on the set of homotopy classes coincide. 

If an $H$-space is equivalent to a [[delooping|deloopable one]], then it is a [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|group object in the (∞,1)-category]] [[Top]]. In other words, in that case, the associativity and other axioms hold up to **coherent homotopy**. 

### K-Theory space


The [[classifying space]] $B U \times \mathbb{Z}$ for (complex) [[topological K-theory]] is an H-ring space (p. 205 (213 of 251) in _[[A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology]]_.)

### Dwyer-Wilkerson space

See at _[[Dwyer-Wilkerson H-space]]_


## Properties

Let $A$ be a [[connected]] H-space. Then for every $a:A$, the [[maps]] $\mu(a,-),\mu(-,a):A \to A$ are [[homotopy equivalences]].

### Nilpotency

Every [[connected topological space|connected]] H-space is [[nilpotent topological space|nilpotent]] (see [there](nilpotent+topological+space#Properties)).

### Relation to $A_\infty$-spaces

Given an [[A-∞ space]] in the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]]/[[Top]], its image in the corresponding [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]] [[Ho(Top)]] in an $H$-space. Conversely, refining an H-space to a genuine $A_\infty$-space means lifting the structure of a [[monoid object in an (∞,1)-category]] from the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] to the genuine [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]]/[[Top]].

Further discussion of this is also at _[loop space -- Homotopy associative structure](loop+space#AInfinityStructure)_.

### Ring structure on homology
 {#RingStructureOnHomology}

The operations on an [[H-space]] $X$ equip its [[homology]] with the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of  [[ring]]. At least for [[ordinary homology]] this is known as the _[[Pontrjagin ring]]_ $H_*(X)$ of $X$.

### Rational homotopy
 {#RationalHomotopy}

Every [[connected topological space|connected]] H-space of rational [[finite type]] (i.e., whose [[rational cohomology]] in each degree is a [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[rational vector space]]) is [[rational homotopy equivalence|rationally homotopy equivalent]] to a [[product space|product]] of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]] (e.g. [May & Ponto 2011, Thm. 9.1.1](#MP11concise)). This means equivalently that its minimal [[Sullivan model]] has vanishing [[differential]], see for instance the example of [[Sullivan models of based loop spaces]].

If such an H-space in addition admits the structure of a [[finite CW-complex]] then it has the [[rational homotopy equivalence|rational homotopy type]] of a finite [[product topological space|product]] of [[odd number|odd]]-[[dimension of a manifold|dimensional]] [[rational n-sphere|rational spheres]] (Cor. 9.1.2. of [May & Ponto 2011](#MP11concise)). 

For example, since [[smooth manifolds]] have CW-complex structure (see [there](CW+complex#SmoothManifoldsAdmitCWComplexStructure)) this  is the case for all [[Lie groups]] (e.g. [Lin 1995](#Lin95)). 

## H-Spaces in homotopy type theory

In [[homotopy type theory]], an *H-Space* consists of

* A type $A$,
* A basepoint $e:A$
* A binary operation $\mu : A \to A \to A$
* A left unitor 
$$\lambda:\prod_{(a:A)} \mu(e,a)=a$$ 
* A right unitor 
$$\rho:\prod_{(a:A)} \mu(a,e)=a$$

A __homomorphism of H-spaces__ between two H-spaces $A$ and $B$ consists of 

* A function $\phi:A \to B$ such that 
  * The basepoint is preserved
$$\phi(e_A) = e_B$$
  * The binary operation is preserved
$$\prod_{(a:A)} \prod_{(b:A)} \phi(\mu_A(a, b)) = \mu_B(\phi(a),\phi(b))$$

* A function 

$$\phi_\lambda:\left(\prod_{(a:A)} \mu(e_A,a)=a\right) \to \left(\prod_{(b:B)} \mu(e_B,b)=b\right)$$

such that the left unitor is preserved:

$$\phi_\lambda(\lambda_A) = \lambda_B$$

* A function 

$$\phi_\rho:\left(\prod_{(a:A)} \mu(a, e_A)=a\right) \to \left(\prod_{(b:B)} \mu(b, e_B)=b\right)$$

such that the right unitor is preserved:

$$\phi_\rho(\rho_A) = \rho_B$$

### Examples

* There is a H-space structure on the [[circle]]. See Lemma 8.5.8 of the [[HoTT book]]. 

\begin{proof}
We define $\mu : S^1 \to S^1 \to S^1$ by circle induction:
$$\mu(base)\equiv id_{S^1}\qquad ap_{\mu}\equiv funext(h)$$
where $h : \prod_{x : S^1} x = x$ is defined in Lemma 6.4.2 of the [[HoTT book]]. We now need to show that $\mu(x,e)=\mu(e,x)=x$ for every $x : S^1$. Showing $\mu(e,x)=x$ is quite simple, the other way requires some more manipulation. Both of which are done in the book.
\end{proof}

* Every [[loop space]] is naturally a [[H-space]] with [[path]] concatenation as the operation. In fact every [[loop space]] is a [[group]].

* The type of [[maps]] $A \to A$ has the structure of a H-space, with basepoint $id_A$, operation function composition.

* An [[A3-space]] $A$ is an H-space with an equality $\mu(\mu(a, b),c)=\mu(a,\mu(b,c))$ for every $a:A$, $b:A$, $c:A$ representing associativity up to homotopy. 

* A unital magma is a 0-truncated H-space.
