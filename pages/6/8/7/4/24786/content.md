## Definition

An **absolutely dense functor** $F \colon A \to B$ is a [[functor]] which is equivalently characterised by the following conditions:

1. $F^* = [F^{op}, Set] \colon [B^{op}, Set] \to [A^{op}, Set]$ is [[fully faithful]].

1. The [[counit]] of the adjunction $F_* \dashv F^* : [B^{op}, Set] \to [A^{op}, Set]$ is invertible.

1. $F$ is [[co-fully faithful]] (also called a [[lax epimorphism]]) in [[Cat]].

1. For every functor $G : B^{op} \times B \to C$, there is a canonical isomorphism ([MathOverflow answer](https://mathoverflow.net/a/354097))
$$ \int_{b \in B} G(b, b) \cong \int_{a \in A} G(F a, F a) $$
(This is a notion of [[final functor|initiality]] for [[ends]].)

More generally, an **absolutely dense morphism** in a [[proarrow equipment]] $K \to M$ is a 1-cell $f : a \to b$ in $K$ for which the counit $f_* \circ f^* \cong 1_b$.
