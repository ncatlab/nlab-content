## Definition

An **absolutely dense functor** $F \colon A \to B$ is a [[functor]] which is equivalently characterised by the following conditions:

1. $[F^{op}, Set] \colon [B^{op}, Set] \to [A^{op}, Set]$ is [[fully faithful]].

1. $F$ is [[co-fully faithful]] (also called a [[lax epimorphism]]) in [[Cat]].
