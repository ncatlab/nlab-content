on the rigorous [[path integral]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] and (mostly [[free quantum field|free]]) [[quantum field theory]] ([[constructive quantum field theory]]). 

In order to construct a fully rigorous definition of a [[quantum field theory]], the authors use the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms to define a notion of a [[quantum field]] that is equivalent to the [[Wightman axioms]], see [[Osterwalder-Schrader theorem]]. 

Note that the ultimate goal of the program, namely the fully rigorous construction of the [[standard model of particle physics]], has not been achived (yet) and has become one of the famous Millennium Problems of the Clay institute.
