#Idea#

BV theory is the answer to two different questions:

 * **Hamiltonian BV**: taking quotients of Poisson manifolds by group actions;

 * **Lagrangian BV**: integrating forms over [[NQ-supermanifold]]s.

##Hamiltonian BV## 

In this context the BV-complex is a [[Homological resolution|homological resolution]] of the problem of taking quotients of symplectic manifolds by group actions.

_Question_: Can you explain more about this? What do you mean by a "homological resolution of the problem"? Is there a nice example? I went over the [blog entry](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/07/poisson_reduction.html) but it seemed to talk about symplectic/Poisson reduction in its own right and didn't yet make the link with the BV formalism.

_Comment_: Kevin Costello is preparing a [book](http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~costello/renormalization) on _Renormalization of quantum field theories_, available on his webpage. He has a section entitled _The BV construction as symplectic reduction_ [](http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~costello/chap3.pdf#page=7). Could you somehow link your explanation to that in some way?

##Lagrangian BV## 

In this context the BV-complex is a means to describe 
[[integration over supermanifolds]] for [[NQ-supermanifold]]s given by [[L-infinity algebroid]]s.

In the physics literture the function algebra of these [[NQ-supermanifold]]s is addressed as the [[BRST complex]].

#Further discussion#

We had a discussion of some aspects of BV-formalism over at the $n$-Category Caf&#233; at [Frobenius Algebras and the BV Formalism](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/frobenius_algebras_and_the_bv.html).
