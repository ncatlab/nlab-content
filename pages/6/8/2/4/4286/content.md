## Idea

A _black hole_ is a [[spacetime]] that solves [[Einstein equations]] of [[general relativity]] characterized by the fact that it posseses an __[[event horizon]]__ hypersurface (or several of them) which has a number of special characteristics; for example the light can not escape from the space confined by the horizon hypersurface due to [[gravity|gravitational]] effects. Much of the theoretical considerations are about the entropy of black holes (cf. [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]) and the information paradox.

Black holes are considered theoretically for [[gravity|gravitational theories]] in various number $d$ of dimension. For $g \geq 5$ a black hole [[spacetime]] may have nontrivial [[topology]], e.g. _black rings_ are possible. 

## Examples

* In usual asymptotically 3+1-dimensinal [[Minkowski spacetime]], the first black hole solution that was found is the [[Schwarzschild black hole]] solution; such a black hole posses a single horizon hypersurface and seems to be stable under various perturbations. 

* Another solution with finite angular momentum is called the [[Kerr spacetime]], and there is a simple generalization having also the electric charge, the Newman solution or the Kerr-Newman black hole. This solution differs pretty much from the Schwarzschild solution and its structure is unstable under various physical mechanisms and perturbations; it posesses two horizons, inner and outer. 

## Empirical observation

See

* [[observing black holes]].


Some candidate [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] objects which seem to point to black hole have been observed.
