In [[category theory]], a concept is (half-jokingly) said to be _evil_ if it involves equations between [[object|objects]].  More precisely:

* A property of categories is _non-evil_ if it when it holds for a [[category]] $C$, it also holds for any category $C'$ that is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to $C$.

* A property of functors is _non-evil_ if when holds for a [[functor]] $F$, it also holds for any functor $F'$ that is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to $F$.

By rigorously avoiding equations between objects, we can ensure that the properties we define are non-evil.  (This should be made more precise, to become a theorem.)

The ideas here generalize in many directions.  For example not only properties, but also constructions involving categories and functors, can be evil or non-evil.  The idea also generalizes to $n$-categories and to objects, morphisms etc. [[internalization|internal]] to $n$-categories.

##Discussion

There's been a lot of discussion of this on the $n$-Category Caf&#233; --- someone find it and cite it!
