## Idea

A [[cell complex]] (such as a [[CW-complex]]) is _locally finite_ if each cell is [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] from all but [[finite set|finitely many]] cells, hence if every point is contained in only a [[finite number]] of cells.

## Properties

\begin{proposition}
A [[CW complex]] is locally finite if and only if it is locally compact.
\end{proposition}
