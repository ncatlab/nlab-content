## Statement


Every [[separable space|separable]] [[metrisable topological space]] is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]].

With the [[axiom of choice]] we have more generally that:


Every [[metrisable topological space]] is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]. 

The orignal **proof**, due to [Stone 1948](#Stone48), used that  [[metric spaces are fully normal]] and showed that [[fully normal spaces are equivalently paracompact]] ("Stone's theorem").

A direct and short proof was later given in [Rudin 1968](#Rudin68).

Historically, first it was shown that [[fully normal spaces are equivalently paracompact]] in

Since it is easy to see that [[metric spaces are fully normal]] this implies that metric spaces and hence metriable topological spaces are paracompact. Accordingly this statement came to be known as _Stone's theorem_.
