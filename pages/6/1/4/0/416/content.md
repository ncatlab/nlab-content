## Idea

In a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $V$ the [[internal hom]] $[-,-] : V^{op} \times V \to V$ satisfies the [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  [v_1,[v_2,v_3]] \simeq [v_2,[v_1,v_3]]
$$

for all [[object]]s $v_i \in V$ ([prop.](closed+monoidal+category#TensorHomIsoInternalizes)). If we regard $V$ as a $V$-[[enriched category]] we write $V(v_1,v_2) := [v_1,v_2]$ and this reads

$$
  V(v_1,V(v_2,v_3)) \simeq V(v_2,V(v_1,v_3))
  \,.
$$

If we now pass more generally to any $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$ then we still have the enriched [[hom object]] functor $C(-,-) : C^{op} \times C \to V$. One says that $C$ is _powered_ over $V$ if it is in addition equipped also with a mixed operation $\pitchfork : V^{op} \times C \to C$ such that $\pitchfork(v,c)$ behaves as if it were a hom of the object $v \in V$ into the object $c \in C$ in that it satisfies the natural isomorphism

$$
  C(c_1,\pitchfork(v,c_2)) \simeq V(v,C(c_1,c_2))
  \,.
$$

## Definition 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Let $V$ be a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[monoidal category]].  In a $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$, the **power** of an object $y\in C$ by an object $v\in V$ is an object $\pitchfork(v,y) \in C$ with a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  C(x, \pitchfork(v,y)) \cong V(v, C(x,y))
$$

where $C(-,-)$ is the $V$-valued hom of $C$ and $V(-,-)$ is the [[internal hom]] of $V$.


We say that $C$ is **powered** or **cotensored** over $V$ if all such power objects exist.

###### Remark

Powers are frequently called _cotensors_ and a $V$-category having all powers is called _cotensored_, while the word "power" is reserved for the case $V=$ [[Set]].  However, there seems to be no good reason for making this distinction.  Moreover, the word "tensor" is fairly overused, and unfortunate since a tensor (= a [[copower]]) is a [[colimit]], while a cotensor (= power) is a [[limit]].

## Properties

* Powers are a special sort of [[weighted limit]]s.  Conversely, all weighted limits can be constructed from powers together with [[conical limit]]s.  The dual colimit notion of a power is a [[copower]].


## Examples

* $V$ itself is always powered over itself, with $\pitchfork(v_1,v_2) := [v_1,v_2]$.

* Every [[locally small category]] $C$ ($V = (Set,\times)$ ) with all [[product]]s  is powered over [[Set]]: the powering operation

  $$
    \pitchfork(S,c) := \prod_{s\in S} c
  $$

  of an object $c$ by a set $S$ forms the $|S|$-fold [[cartesian product]] of $c$ with itself, where $|S|$ is the [[cardinality]] of $S$. 

  The defining natural isomorphism

  $$
    Hom_C(c_1,\pitchfork(S,c_2))\simeq Hom_{Set}(S,Hom_C(c_1,c_2))
  $$

  is effectively the definition of the product (see [[limit]]).
