## Definition

A _discrete group_ is a [[group object]] in [[discrete space]]s.

Equivalently this is just an ordinary group -- a [[set]] with a group structure. One says _discrete group_ for emphasis in a context where by default one is speaking about [[topological group]]s or [[Lie group]]s or groups equipped with other [[stuff, structure, property|structure]]. See [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] for more discussion.
