## Idea

A __discrete group__ is a [[group object]] in [[discrete spaces]].

Equivalently this is just an ordinary [[group]] -- a [[set]] with a group structure. One says _discrete group_ for emphasis in a context where by default one is speaking about [[topological group]]s or [[Lie group]]s or groups equipped with other [[stuff, structure, property|structure]]. See [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] for more discussion.
