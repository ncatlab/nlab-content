## Idea

A relation whose [[double negation]] implies the relation itself. 

## Definition

A stable [[binary relation]] $R$ on a set $S$ is a relation such that for all elements $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $\neg \neg R(a, b)$ implies that $R(a, b)$. 

## Examples

* Every [[decidable relation]] is a stable relation. 

* The [[denial inequality relation]] of a set is a stable relation. 

* In any [[inequality space]], [[equality]] is a stable relation. 

* [[Markov's principle]] states that the [[strict order]] for the [[modulated Cauchy real numbers]]  is a stable relation. 

* The [[analytic Markov's principle]] states that the [[strict order]] for the [[Dedekind real numbers]] is a stable relation. 

* Given a relation $R$, the negation of the relation $\neg R$ is a stable relation. 

* In the presence of the [[double negation law]], every relation is a stable relation.
