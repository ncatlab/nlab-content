Classical _[[affine algebraic variety|affine algebraic varieties]]_ appear as sets of zeros of a set $S = \{P_\alpha|\alpha\in A\}$ of polynomials in affine $n$-dimensional space $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ over a field $k$. The coordinate algebra of $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ is the algebra of [[polynomial]]s in $n$ variables, $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and the coordinate algebra of an affine algebraic variety is $R := k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ where $I:= \langle S\rangle$ is the [[ideal]] generated by $S$. 

The __Hilbert basis theorem__ asserts that this ideal $I$ is finitely generated; and consequently $R$ is a [[noetherian ring]]. For a proof see standard textbooks on commutative algebra or algebraic geometry (e.g. Atiyah, MacDonald); there is also a proof on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_basis_theorem).
