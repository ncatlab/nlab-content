## Idea

The fractional superstrings are supposed to be a family of generalizations of the [[superstring]] that exhibit [[parafermion]] statistics. They were first described in [Argyres and Henry Tye (1991)](#AH91) in an attempt to find other kinds of string theories with lower critical dimension (see [[string theory]]).

A string theory (as a [[sigma-model]]) defines in particular a two-dimensional [[worldvolume]] (i.e. worldsheet) theory with specific [[symmetries|symmetry]]: a [[conformal field theory]] in the bosonic case, and a [[SCFT|superconformal field theory]] in the super- case. The idea is to start from the worldsheet theory and impose particular transformations as symmetries of the theory, motivated by the assumption that any theory defined as such corresponds to a worldsheet theory. These symmetry transformations include generators, or currents, with fractional spins, of which the $\frac{3}{2}$-spin current of the superstring case is an example.

Some consistency checks are described in ([Henry Tye (1993)](#HenryTye93)).

The relevant geometric structure on the worlsheet appears to be an *r-spin* structure (see e.g. ([Randal-Williams (2010)](#Randal-Williams10)) ([Runkel and Szegedy (2018)](#RS18))).
