
## Idea

Just as a [[Lie triple system]] axiomatizes the properties of the ternary operation $[a,b,c] = [[a,b],c]$ in an associative algebra where $[a,b] = a b - b a$ is the [[commutator]], a **Jordan triple system** axiomatizes the properties of the so-called Jordan triple product $\{a,b,c\} = \{\{a,b\},c\}$ in an associative algebra where $\{a,b\} = a b + b a$ is the [[anticommutator]].  Just as Lie triple systems arise naturally from $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded [[Lie algebras]], Jordan triple systems arise naturally from so-called **3-graded Lie algebras**, which are $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras concentrated in degrees $-1,0$ and $1$.   And just as the tangent space of any point in a [[symmetric space]] is naturally a Lie triple system, the tangent space of any point in a [[hermitian]] symmetric space is naturally a Jordan triple system.
