##Idea##

Directed Homotopy Theory is a form of [[homotopy theory]] which tries to study the properties of [[directed space]]s. Much of the impetus for the theory has come from work on modelling concurrent process. It can also be seen as a way of studying an 'evolving' space. This is discussed in more detail in the entry on [[motivation for directed homotopy]]

and the possibility of an analogue of covering spaces in

Philippe Gaucher (PPS, Paris) has introduced an interesting related model, namely that of 'flows'.  These are, approximately, topological categories without identity arrows.  They are intended as another model of processes. One of his papers on this idea is at [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0308054v1), published as

###Comment###
[[Tim Porter|Tim]]: A related topic is that of higher dimensional automata. Perhaps someone who knows a little more than I do about this could comment on the links with other aspects of the nLab.
