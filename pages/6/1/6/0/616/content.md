##Idea##

Directed Homotopy Theory is a form of homotopy theory which tries to study the properties of [[directed space]]s.  Initially it used [[pospace]]s as the objects, that is spaces with a closed partial order, but with the introduction of [[d-space]]s by Grandis, these have become, perhaps, the more common objects of study.  

Much of the impetus for the theory has come from work on modelling concurrent process. It can also be seen as a way of studying an 'evolving' space.

##References and (a little) Discussion##

Marco Grandis' work on the area is listed amongst his publications at his ([homepage](http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/rec.public_grandis.html)).

Foundational work was done by Eric Goubault and his collaborators.

Categorical aspects are looked at in

The fundamental category of a pospace is discussed in

Philippe Gaucher (PPS, Paris) has introduced an interesting related model, namely that of 'flows'.  These are, approximately, topological categories without identity arrows.  They are intended as another model of processes. One of his papers on this idea is at [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0308054v1), published as 

*  Philippe Gaucher, A model category for the homotopy theory of concurrency, Homology Homotopy and Applications, vol. 5 (1):p.549-599, 2003.

 A websearch will find others.

Another approach to model category structures in this area is by Kahl, who uses a Baues type fibration category approach.

Krzysztof Worytkiewicz and Peter Bubenik have given a model category structure for local pospaces:

###Comment###
[[Tim Porter|Tim]]: A related topic is that of higher dimensional automata. Perhaps someone who knows a little more than I do about this could comment on the links with other aspects of the nLab.
