## Definition ##

By a *compact connected space* one will typically mean a [[topological space]] which is both [[compact topological space|compact]] and [[connected topological space|connected]].

Beware that in [[constructive mathematics]] there is a definition of "compact connectedness" which is really just one version of "connectedness", see at *[[connected topological space]]* the section *[Constructive definition](connected+space#ConstructiveDefinition)*.
