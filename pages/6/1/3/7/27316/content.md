## Idea

A _(weakly) stable Yang-Mills-Higgs connection_ (or _(weakly) stable YMH connection_) is a [[Yang-Mills-Higgs connection]], around which the Yang-Mills-Higgs [[action functional]] is positive or even strictly positively curved:

[[Yang-Mills-Higgs connections]] are [[critical points]] of the Yang-Mills-Higgs action functional, where the first [[variational calculus|variational]] derivative vanishes. For (weakly) stable Yang-Mills connections, the second derivative is additionally required to be positive or even strictly positive.


## Basics

Consider

* $G$ a [[Lie group]] and $\mathfrak{g}$ its [[Lie algebra]],

* $B$ an [[orientable]] [[Riemannian manifold]] with Riemannian metric $g$ and volume form $\operatorname{vol}_g$,

* $E\twoheadrightarrow B$ a [[principal bundle|principal $G$-bundle]] and $\operatorname{Ad}(E)\coloneqq E\times_G\mathfrak{g}\twoheadrightarrow B$ its [[adjoint bundle]],

* $A\in\Omega_{\operatorname{Ad}}^1(E,\mathfrak{g})\cong\Omega^1(B,\operatorname{Ad}(E))$ a [[principal connection]],

* $F_A\coloneqq\mathrm{d}A+\frac{1}{2}[A\wedge A]\in\Omega_{\operatorname{Ad}}^2(E,\mathfrak{g})\cong\Omega^2(B,\operatorname{Ad}(E))$ its [[curvature]]. If $A$ is a Yang-Mills connection, $F_A$ is also called [[Yang-Mills field]].

## Definition

The _Yang-Mills action functional_ (or _YM action functional_) is given by:

$$
\operatorname{YM}\colon\Omega^1(B,\operatorname{Ad}(E))\rightarrow\mathbb{R},
\operatorname{YM}(A)
\coloneqq\int_B\|F_A\|^2\mathrm{d}\operatorname{vol}_g.
$$

$A$ is called a _stable Yang-Mills connection_ (or _stable YM connection_) iff:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}\operatorname{YM}(\alpha(t))\vert_{t=0}
\gt 0
$$

for all smooth families $\alpha\colon(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\rightarrow\Omega^1(B,\operatorname{Ad}(E))$ with $\alpha(0)=A$. It is called _weakly stable_ if only $\geq 0$ holds. If it is not weakly stable, it is called _unstable_.

([Chiang 2013, Definition 3.1.7]({#Chiang13}))

For comparison, the condition for a _Yang-Mills connection_ (or _YM connection_) is:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\operatorname{YM}(\alpha(t))\vert_{t=0}
=0.
$$

If $A$ is a (weakly) stable or unstable Yang-Mills connection, $F_A$ is also called _(weakly) stable_ or _unstable Yang-Mills field_.

## Properties

\begin{theorem}
Every weakly stable Yang-Mills connection on $S^n$ for $n\geq 5$ is flat.
\end{theorem}

([Bourguignon & Lawson 81, Theorem A]({#BourguignonLawson81}), [Kobayashi, Ohnita & Takeuchi 86, Theorem 1.3.]({#KobayashiOhnitaTakeuchi86}), [Kawai 86]({#Kawai86}), [Chiang 13, Theorem 3.1.9]({#Chiang13}))

[[James Simons]] presented this result without written publication during a symposium on _Minimal Submanifolds and Geodesics_ in Tokyo in September 1977.

\begin{theorem}
If for a [[compact]] $n$-dimensional smooth submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ a $\varepsilon\gt 0$ exists, so that:
$$
\frac{2}{n-2}\varepsilon
\lt\lambda_i
\leq\varepsilon
$$
at every point for all principal curvatures $\lambda_i$, then all weakly stable Yang-Mills connections on it are flat.
\end{theorem}

([Kawai 86]({#Kawai86}))

This includes the previous theorem as a special case.

\begin{theorem}
Every weakly stable $\operatorname{SU}(2)$- or $\operatorname{SU}(3)$-Yang-Mills field on $S^4$ is either [[D=4 Yang-Mills theory|selfdual]] or [[D=4 Yang-Mills theory|anti-selfdual]].
\end{theorem}

([Bourguignon & Lawson 81, Theorem B]({#BourguignonLawson81}), [Chiang 213, Theorem 3.1.10]({#Chiang13}))

\begin{theorem}
All weakly stable Yang-Mills connections on a [[compact]] [[orientable]] [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] Riemannian $4$-manifold with [[structure group]] $\operatorname{SU}(2)$ are either [[D=4 Yang-Mills theory|selfdual]], [[D=4 Yang-Mills theory|antiselfdual]] or reduce to an abelian field.
\end{theorem}

([Bourguignon & Lawson 81, Theorem B']({#BourguignonLawson81}), [Chiang 213, Theorem 3.1.11]({#Chiang13}))

## Yang-Mills-unstable manifolds

A [[compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]], for which no [[principal bundle]] over it (with a [[compact]] [[Lie group]] as [[structure group]]) has a stable Yang-Mills connection is called _Yang-Mills-unstable_ (or _YM-unstable_). For example, the spheres $S^n$ are Yang–Mills-unstable for $n\geq 5$ because of the above result from [[James Simons]]. A Yang–Mills-unstable manifold always has a vanishing second [[Betti number]].

([Kobayashi, Ohnita & Takeuchi 86, Theorem 2.17.]({#KobayashiOhnitaTakeuchi86}))

Central for the proof is that the infinite [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is the classifying space $\operatorname{BU}(1)$ as well as the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb {Z} ,2)$. Hence principal $\operatorname{U}(1)$-bundles over a Yang–Mills-unstable manifold $X$ (but even more generally every [[CW complex]]) are classified by its second [[cohomology]] (with integer coefficients):

$$
\operatorname{Prin}_{\operatorname{U}(1)}(X)
\cong[X,\operatorname{BU}(1)]
=[X,K(\mathbb{Z},2)]
=H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}).
$$

On a non-trivial principal $\operatorname{U}(1)$-bundles over $X$, which exists for a non-trivial second cohomology, one could construct a stable Yang–Mills connection.

Open problems about Yang-Mills-unstable manifolds include:

* Is a [[simply connected]] compact simple [[Lie group]] always Yang-Mills-unstable?

* Is a Yang-Mills-instable simply connected compact Riemannian manifold always harmonically instable? Since $S^n\times S^1$ for $n\geq 5$ is Yang-Mills-unstable, but not harmonically instable, the condition to be simply connected cannot be dropped.
