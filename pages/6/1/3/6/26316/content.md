## Overview

Class $\mathcal{S}$ (for "six") originally denoted a specific class of $N=2$ 4d [[super Yang-Mills theory]] introduced in [Gaiotto, Moore & Neitzke 2009](#GMN2009). They originate from [[KK-compactification]] of [[M5-branes]] on punctured [[Riemann surfaces]] $C$ and are labelled by a [[simply laced Lie group]], a [[Riemann surface]] $C$, and a decoration of the punctures of $C$ by defect operators.

By further compactifications, one relates theories of this class with certain [[superconformal symmetry|superconformal]] field theories in  dimension $2$ (or, in other formalism, [[chiral algebras]]) which are now also said to be of class $S$ (see at [[AGT correspondence]]).

  > We give a functorial construction of the genus zero chiral algebras of class $\mathcal{S}$, that is, the vertex algebras corresponding to the theory of class $\mathcal{S}$ associated with genus zero pointed Riemann surfaces via the 4d/2d duality discovered by Beem, Lemos, Liendo, Peelaers, Rastelli and van Rees in physics. We show that there is a unique family of vertex algebras satisfying the required conditions and show that they are all simple and conformal. In fact, our construction works for any complex semisimple group G that is not necessarily simply laced. Furthermore, we show that the associated varieties of these vertex algebras are exactly the genus zero Moore-Tachikawa symplectic varieties that have been recently constructed by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima using the geometry of the affine Grassmannian for the Langlands dual group.
