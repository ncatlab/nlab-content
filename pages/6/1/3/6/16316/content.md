## Idea 

The [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of _mixed Tate motives_ $DTM(S)$ is the [[localizing subcategory]] of the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[mixed motives]] $DM(S)$ generated by the twists of the [[Tate motive]] $\mathbf{Z}(n)$.

## Properties

* $DTM(S)$ can be described as a [[coreflective sub-(infinity,1)-category]] of $DM(S)$, since it follows from a theorem of [[Amnon Neeman]] that the inclusion admits a [[right adjoint]].

* The existence of a [[left adjoint]] is false for [[algebraically closed fields]] that are not the [[algebraic closure]] of a [[finite field]], while for fields [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over a [[finite field]], the [[Tate-Beilinson conjecture]] would imply that the inclusion is a [[Frobenius functor]], i.e. that the [[right adjoint]] is also a [[left adjoint]].  See ([Totaro 15](#Totaro15)).
