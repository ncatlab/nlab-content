## Proofs as processes

Caires & Pfenning (2010) established a correspondence between intuitionistic [[linear logic]] and session typed [[π-calculus]].
Later on, Wadler (2012) established a correspondence between classical linear logic and the same calculus.

* propositions as session types
* proofs as π-processes
* cut reduction as communication
