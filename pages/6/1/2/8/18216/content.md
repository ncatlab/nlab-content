## Idea


Given an [[n-sphere]] $S^n$, regarded under its standard [[embedding]] into [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, then its _equator_ is the [[intersection]] with $\mathbb{R}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. 

The equator devides the $n$-sphere into its to [[hemi-n-spheres]].

For $n \geq 1$, the full $n$-sphere is the [[suspension]] of its equator $(n-1)$-sphere, namely the [[union]] of all [[meridians]] passing through the equator.
