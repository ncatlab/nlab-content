## Idea

Motivated by the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]], the _suspension category_ of ([Spanier-Whitehead 53](#SpanierWhitehead53)) has as [[objects]] [[pointed topological space|pointed]]  [[CW-complexes]], and as [[hom-sets]] it has [[colimits]] 

$$
  Hom(X,Y) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_q [\Sigma^q X , \Sigma^q Y]
$$ 

over [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]] between their arbitrary high [[suspensions]].

More generally one considers the category whose objects are pairs $(X,n)$ of a [[pointed topological space|pointed]]  [[CW-complex]] $X$ and an [[integer]] $n$ and whose [[hom-sets]] are 

$$
  Hom((X_1,n_1), (X_2,n_2)) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{q \gt max({\vert n_1\vert},{\vert n_2\vert})} [\Sigma^{q+n_1} X_1 , \Sigma^{q+n_2} X_2]
  \,.
$$

This is a [[triangulated category]].

But the Spanier-Whitehead category lacks other desirable properties, for instance it does not have all [[coproducts]] and the canonical functor from the homotopy category of [[pointed topological spaces]] does not preserve the coproducts that already exist. As a consequence, in particular a [[Brown representability theorem]] does not hold in the SW-category.

Later it was realized (see e.g. [Whitehead 62](#Whitehead62)) that this all this is fixed by regardeding the SW-category for [[finite CW complexes]] as a [[full subcategory]] on the (shifted) [[suspension spectra]]  inside the larger category of [[spectra]]: the [[stable homotopy category]] (e.g. [Schwede 12, chapter II theorem 7.2](#Schwede12)). As such it is the full subcategory on the [[finite spectra]] (e.g. [Schwede 12, chapter II theorem 7.4](#Schwede12)).
