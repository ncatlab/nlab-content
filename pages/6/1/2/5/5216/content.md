## Idea

One form of the [[bicategory#Coherence|coherence theorem for bicategories]] states that every [[bicategory]] is [[equivalence of bicategories|equivalent]] to a [[strict 2-category]].  **Lack's coherence observation** (named for [[Steve Lack]]) states that naturally occurring bicategories tend to be [[equivalence of bicategories|equivalent]] to naturally occurring strict 2-categories.  

## Examples

Instances of Lack's coherence observation include:

* The bicategory [[Prof]] of [[small categories]] and [[profunctors]] is equivalent to the strict 2-category of [[presheaf categories]] and [[cocontinuous functors]].

* The bicategory [[Span]](C) of [[spans]] in a category $C$ with [[pullbacks]] is equivalent to the strict 2-category of [[slice categories]] of $C$ and [[linear polynomial functors]]. More generally, the bicategory of [[polynomial functor|polynomials]] in a [[locally cartesian closed category]] is equivalent to the strict 2-category of slices and [[polynomial functors]].

Both examples are instances of a more general result. Given a [[relative pseudomonad]] $T$ on a strict 2-category $K$, the [[Eilenberg--Moore bicategory]] of $T$ will also be a strict 2-category, whereas the [[Kleisli bicategory]] will usually not be. However, the Kleisli bicategory embeds fully faithfully into the Eilenberg--Moore bicategory, and so will be [[biequivalent]] to the full sub-2-category of the Eilenberg--Moore bicategory on the free algebras.

It is not clear whether there are other examples that are not special cases of the observation above.
