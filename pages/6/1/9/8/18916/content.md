## Idea

In [[number theory]], _[[Ken Ribet]]'s theorem_ is a statement about [[Galois representations]] associated with [[modular forms]]. 

[[Jean-Pierre Serre]] ad [[Ken Ribet]] observed that together with assuming the [[Taniyama-Shimura modularity conjecture]] (as yet unproven at that time), Ribet's theorem implies [[Fermat's last theorem]]. The [[modularity theorem]] was then proven by [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Richard Taylor]], thus often known now as _[[Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem]]_.

## Statement

Let $f$ be a weight $2$ newform of level $\Gamma_{0}(q N)$, with $q$ not dividing $N$. Let $\overline{\rho}_{f,p}$ be the associated absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional mod $p$ [[Galois representation]] which is unramified if $q\neq p$ and finite flat if $q=p$.

Then there exists another weight $2$ newform $g$, of level $\Gamma_{0}(N)$, with associated mod $p$ Galois representation $\overline{\rho}_{g,p}$, such that

$$\overline{\rho}_{f,p}\simeq\overline{\rho}_{g,p}.$$
