The __characteristic function__ of a [[subset]] $U$ of some [[set]] $X$ is a [[function]] from $X$ to the set $TV$ of [[truth values]] (which classically is $TV = \{\bot,\top\}$) that takes $a$ in $X$ to the truth value of the statement that $a \in U$.  That is,

$$ \chi_U(a) \;\Leftrightarrow\; a \in U ,$$

where $\chi_U$ (also often $1_U$) is the characteristic function of $U$.
