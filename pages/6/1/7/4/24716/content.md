## Idea

While the inherently [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of [[quantum physics]] means, roughly, that as soon as there is more than one possibility, no [[quantum measurement]] outcome can be known with certainty; conversely this also means that all outcomes are possible with some probability. This converse statement had been stated by [Gell-Mann 1956](#GellMann56) for the case of [[quantum hadrodynamics]] (p. 859) in this form \[our emphasis\]:

> "Principle of Compulsory Strong Interactions". Among baryons, antibaryons, and mesons, **any process which is not forbidden** by a conservation law **actually does take place** with appreciable probability. 

The statement is recalled by [Bunge 1976, p. 31](#Bunge76) in the form \[our emphasis\]:

> Anything that is not forbidden is compulsory. 

> A more careful wording of the above principle is this: **All possible** repetitive chance **events** (in particular all those consistent with the conservation laws) are likely to **occur** in the long run.

and by [Israel 1996](#Israel96) in the form:

> What is not forbidden is compulsory.

For better or worse, [Gell-Mann 1956](#GellMann56) on that same page 859 found it helpful to add (about the [[contrapositive]] statement) that:

> this is related to the state of affairs that is said to prevail in a perfect totalitarian state. Anything that is not compulsory is forbidden.

and some historians of science swallowed this red herring and ever since refer to Gell-Mann's "principle of quantum compulsion"  instead as the "totalitarian principle" (eg. [Jaeger 2017](#Jaeger17), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian_principle), cf. [Kragh 2019a](#Kragh19a)). See also the "principle of plenitude" (cf. [Kragh 2019b](#Kragh19b)).

Notice that Gell-Mann's principle goes against the grain of the *classical* implication (see *[[modal logic]]*), which is the implication in the opposite direction:

$$
  \array{
    necessary && actual && possible
    \\
    \Box (-) &\rightarrow& (-) &\rightarrow& \lozenge (-)
  }
$$

That in [[quantum physics]] this implication may in fact be reversed can be understood as [[ambidextrous adjunction|ambidexterity]] 
$$
  \lozenge \mathscr{H}_\bullet
  \;\simeq\;
  \Box \mathscr{H}_\bullet
$$

of finite-dimensional [[dependent linear types]] $\mathscr{H}_\bullet$, see at *[[quantum circuits via dependent linear types]]*.
