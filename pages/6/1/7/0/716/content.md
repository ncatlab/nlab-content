A **compact closed category** is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] for which each object $A$ has a **dual** $A^*$.
This is an object equipped with morphisms called the **unit** 

$$i: I \to A \otimes A^* $$

and **counit**

$$e : A^* \otimes A \to I $$

satisfying the 'triangle identities' familiar from the concept of [[adjunction]].
