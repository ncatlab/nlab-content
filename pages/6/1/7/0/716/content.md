## Definition

A **compact closed category**, or simply a **compact category**, is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] in which every object is [[dualizable object|dualizable]], hence a [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]] [[symmetric monoidal category]].

More generally, if we drop the symmetry requirement, we obtain a [[rigid monoidal category]], a.k.a. an *autonomous category*.  Thus a compact category may also be called a **rigid symmetric monoidal category** or a **symmetric autonomous category**.  A maximally clear, but rather verbose, term would be a **symmetric monoidal category with duals for objects**.

## Properties

### Internal hom and compact closure

A rigid symmetric monoidal category $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is in particular a [[closed monoidal category]], with the [[internal hom]] given by 

$$
  [A,B] \simeq A^* \otimes B
$$ 

(where $A^*$ is the [[dual object]] of $A$), via the [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}(C,[A,B])
  \simeq
  \mathcal{C}(C, A^\ast \otimes B)
  \simeq
  \mathcal{C}(C \otimes A, B)
  \,.
$$

This is what the terminology "compact closed" refers to.

### Relation to traced monoidal categories
 {#RelationToTracedMonoidalCategories}

Given a [[traced monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$, there is a [[free construction]] completion of it to a compact closed category $Int(\mathcal{C})$ ([Joyal-Street-Verity 96](#JoyalStreetVerity96)):

the objects of $Int(\mathcal{C})$ are pairs $(A^+, A^-)$ of objects of $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ in $Int(\mathcal{C})$ is given by a morphism of the form $A^+\otimes B^- \longrightarrow A^- \otimes B^+$ in $\mathcal{C}$, and [[composition]] of two such morphisms $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ and $(B^+ , B^-) \to (C^+ , C^-)$ is given by [[trace|tracing out]] $B^+$ and $B^-$ in the evident way.


### Relation to star-autnomous categories

A compact closed category is a [[star-autonomous category]]: the [[tensor unit]] is a [[dualizing object]].

## Examples

* The category [[FinVect]] of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]] is compact closed, see [here](finite-dimensional+vector+space#CompactClosure).
