The following treatment of [[information geometry]] (and Fisher metric in particular) is using [[diffeological space]]s (motivated by singular statistical models, including from [[machine learning]])

>  In this paper, first, we survey the concept of diffeological Fisher metric and its naturality, using functorial language of probability morphisms, and slightly extending Lê's theory in (Le2020) to include weakly $C^k$-diffeological statistical models. Then we introduce the resulting notions of the diffeological Fisher distance, the diffeological Hausdorff--Jeffrey measure and explain their role in classical and Bayesian nonparametric estimation problems in statistics.
