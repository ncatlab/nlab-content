>  In this paper, first, we survey the concept of diffeological Fisher metric and its naturality, using functorial language of probability morphisms, and slightly extending Lê's theory in (Le2020) to include weakly $C^k$-diffeological statistical models. Then we introduce the resulting notions of the diffeological Fisher distance, the diffeological Hausdorff--Jeffrey measure and explain their role in classical and Bayesian nonparametric estimation problems in statistics.

>    In this paper I propose a generative model of supervised learning that unifies two approaches to supervised learning, using a concept of a correct loss function. Addressing two measurability problems, which have been ignored in statistical learning theory, I propose to use convergence in outer probability to characterize the consistency of a learning algorithm. Building upon these results, I extend a result due to Cucker-Smale, which addresses the learnability of a regression model, to the setting of a conditional probability estimation problem. Additionally, I present a variant of Vapnik-Stefanyuk's regularization method for solving stochastic ill-posed problems, and using it to prove the generalizability of overparameterized supervised learning models.
