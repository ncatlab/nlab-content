## **Supergeometry**

In [[nLab:Klein geometry]] and [[nLab:Cartan geometry]] the fundamental geometric concept is the [[nLab:symmetry group]] $G$ of the local model [[nLab:space]], which is then recovered as some [[nLab:coset space]] $G/H$. These symmetry groups $G$ are reflected in their [[nLab:categories of representations]] $Rep(G)$, which are certain nice [[nLab:tensor categories]]. In terms of [[nLab:physics]] via [[nLab:Wigner classification]], the [[nLab:irreducible objects]] in  $Rep(G)$ label the possible [[nLab:fundamental particle]] species on the [[nLab:spacetime]] $G/H$. Hence if we regard the [[nLab:tensor category]] $Rep(G)$ as the actual fundamental concept, then the natural question is that of _[[nLab:Tannaka duality|Tannaka reconstruction]]_: Given any nice [[nLab:tensor category]], is it [[nLab:equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $Rep(G)$ for some symmetry group $G$? For [[nLab:rigid monoidal category|rigid]] [[nLab:tensor categories]] in [[nLab:characteristic zero]] subject only to a mild size constraint this is answered by **[[nLab:Deligne's theorem on tensor categories]]** (theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) : all of them are, but only if we allow $G$ to be a "[[nLab:supergroup]]".

### **Model layer**

#### Superalgebra
 {#Superalgebra}

We start by introducing the basic concepts of [[tensor categories]] along with the basic examples of [[vector spaces]] and [[super vector spaces]]:

* _[Tensor categories](#TensorProductsAndMonoidalCategories)_

This allows to speak of [[commutative algebra]] [[internalization|internal]] to tensor categories. Specializing this to the tensor category of [[super vector spaces]] yields [[supercommutative superalgebras]]. The [[formal duals]] of these are the [[affine variety|affine]] [[super schemes]]. This we discuss in

* _[Commutative algebra in tensor categories and Affine super-spaces](#CommutativeAlgebraInTensorCategories)_

Next we introduce the concept of [[commutative monoids]] equipped with the structure of a [[commutative Hopf algebras]] and explain how these are [[formal duals]] to [[group objects|groups]]. Then we use this to motivate and explain the concept of (affine algebraic) [[supergroups]] as [[formal duals]] to [[commutative Hopf algebras]] internal to the tensor category of [[super vector spaces]], namely [[supercommutative Hopf algebras]]:

* _[(Super-)Groups as (Super-)commutative Hopf algebras](#GroupsAsHopfAlgebras)_

Finally we discuss how under this relation [[linear representations]] of groups correspond to [[comodules]] over their formally dual [[commutative Hopf algebras]], and we introduce the key class of categories of interest here: tensor-[[categories of representations]] of groups and of super-representations of super-groups:

* _[Linear representations as comodules](#LinearRepresentationsAsComodules)_


##### Tensor products and Tensor categories
 {#TensorProductsAndMonoidalCategories}

+-- {: .num_defn #VectorSpaces} 
###### Definition

For $k$ a [[field]], we write $Vect_k$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are $k$-[[vector spaces]];

* [[morphisms]] are $k$-[[linear functions]] between these.

When the [[ground field]] $k$ is understood or when its precise nature is irrelevant, we will often notationally suppress it and speak of just the category [[Vect]] of vector spaces.

This is the category inside which [[linear algebra]] takes place.

=--

Of course the category [[Vect]] has some special properties. Not only are its objects "linear spaces", but the whole category inherits linear structure of sorts. This is traditionally captured by the following terminology for **[[additive and abelian categories]]**. Notice that there are several different but equivalent ways to state the following properties (discussed behind the relevant links).

+-- {: .num_defn #AdditiveAndAbelianCategories} 
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]]. 

1. Say that $\mathca{C}$ has **[[direct sums]]** if its has [[finite products]] and [[finite coproducts]] and if the canonical comparison  morphism between these is an [[isomorphism]]. We write $V \oplus W$ for the direct sum of two objects of $\mathcal{C}$ in this.

1. Say that $\mathcal{C}$ is an **[[additive category]]** if it has [[direct sums]] and in addition it is [[Ab-enriched category|enriched in abelian groups]], meaning that every [[hom-set]] is equipped with the stucture of an [[abelian group]] such that [[composition]] of morphisms is a [[bilinear map]].

1.Say that $\mathcal{C}$ is an **[[abelian category]]** if it is an [[additive category]] and has property that its [[monomorphisms]] are precisely the inclusions of [[kernels]] and its [[epimorphisms]] are precisely the projections onto [[cokernels]].

=--

We also make the following definition of $k$-linear category, but notice that conventions differ as to which extra properties beyond [[Vect]]-[[enriched category|enrichment]] to require on a linear category:

+-- {: .num_defn #LinearCategory} 
###### Definition

For $k$ a [[field]] (or more generally just a [[commutative ring]]), call a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ a **$k$-[[linear category]]** if

1. it is an [[abelian category]] (def. \ref{AdditiveAndAbelianCategories});

1. its [[hom-sets]] have the structure of $k$-[[vector spaces]] (generally $k$-[[modules]]) such that [[composition]] of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[bilinear map]] 

and the underlying additive [[abelian group]] structure of these [[hom-spaces]] is that of the underlying [[abelian category]].

In other words, a $k$-linear category is an [[abelian category]] with the additional structure of a [[Vect]]-[[enriched category]] (generally $k$[[Mod]]-enriched) such that the underlying [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enrichment]] according to def. \ref{AdditiveAndAbelianCategories} is obtained from the $Vect$-enrichment under the [[forgetful functor]] $Vect \to Ab$.

A [[functor]] between $k$-linear categories is called a **$k$-[[linear functor]]** if its component functions on [[hom-sets]] are [[linear maps]] with respect to the given $k$-linear structure. 

=--

+-- {: .num_example} 
###### Example

The category [[Vect]]${}_k$ of [[vector spaces]] (def. \ref{VectorSpaces}) is a $k$-[[linear category]] according to def. \ref{LinearCategory}.

Here the abstract [[direct sum]] is the usual direct sum of [[vector spaces]], whence the name of the general concept.

For $V,W$ two $k$-vector spaces, the vector space structure on the [[hom-set]] $Hom_{Vect}(V,W)$ of [[linear maps]] $\phi \colon V \to W$ is given by "pointwise" multiplication and addition of functions:

$$
  (k_1 \phi_1 + k_2 \phi_2)
  \;\colon\,
   v \;\mapsto\;
   k_1 \phi_1(v) + k_2 \phi_2(v)
  \,.
$$


=--

Recall the basic construction of the [[tensor product of vector spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorProductOfVectorSpaces} 
###### Definition

Given two [[vector spaces]] over some [[field]] $k$,  $V_1, V_2 \in Vect_k$, their [[tensor product of vector spaces]] is the vector space denoted

$$
  V_1 \otimes_k V_2 \;\in\; Vect
$$

whose elements are [[equivalence classes]] of  [[tuples]] of elements $(v_1,v_2)$ with $v_i \in V_i$, for the [[equivalence relation]] given by

$$
  (k v_1 , v_2) \;\sim\; (v_1, k v_2)
$$

$$
  (v_1 + v'_1 , v_2) \; \sim \; (v_1,v_2) + (v'_1, v_2)
$$

$$
  (v_1 , v_2 + v'_2) \; \sim \; (v_1,v_2) + (v_1, v'_2)
$$

More abstractly this means that the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] is the vector space characterized by the fact that

1. it receives a [[bilinear map]]
   
   $$
     V_1 \times V_2 \longrightarrow V_1 \otimes V_2
   $$

   (out of the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets)

1. any other [[bilinear map]] of the form

   $$
     V_1 \times V_2 \longrightarrow V_3
   $$

   factors through the above bilinear map via a unique [[linear map]]

   $$
     \array{
        V_1 \times V_2 &\overset{bilinear}{\longrightarrow}& V_3
        \\
        \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists ! \, linear}}
         \\
         V_1 \otimes_k V_2
     }
   $$

=--

The existence of the [[tensor product of vector spaces]], def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}, equips the category [[Vect]] of vector spaces with extra structure, which is a "[[categorification]]" of the familair structure of a [[semi-group]]. One also says "[[monoid]]" for [[semi-group]] and therefore [[categories]] equippd with a [[tensor product]] operation are also called  _[[monoidal categories]]_:
 

+-- {: .num_defn #MonoidalCategory} 
###### Definition

A **[[monoidal category]]** is a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with 

1. a [[functor]]

   $$ 
      \otimes 
        \;\colon\; 
      \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}  
       \longrightarrow
      \mathcal{C}
   $$

   out of the [[product category]] of $\mathcal{C}$ with itself, called the **[[tensor product]]**, 

1. an object

   $$ 
     1 \in \mathcal{C} 
   $$

   called the **[[unit object]]** or **[[tensor unit]]**, 

1. a [[natural isomorphism]] 

   $$
     a 
       \;\colon\; 
     ((-)\otimes (-)) \otimes (-)
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-) \otimes ((-)\otimes(-))
   $$

   called the **[[associator]]**, 

1. {#MonoidalCategoryUnitors} a [[natural isomorphism]] 

   $$
     \ell
       \;\colon\; 
     (1 \otimes (-)) 
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-)
   $$

   called the **[[left unitor]]**, and a natural isomorphism 

   $$
     r \;\colon\; (-) \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} (-)
   $$

   called the **[[right unitor]]**, 

such that the following two kinds of [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]], for all objects involved:

1. **triangle identity**:

   $$
     \array{
        & (x \otimes 1) \otimes y &\stackrel{a_{x,1,y}}{\longrightarrow} & x \otimes (1 \otimes y)
         \\     
         & {}_{\rho_x \otimes 1_y}\searrow       
         && \swarrow_{1_x \otimes \lambda_y}
         & 
        \\
        &&
        x \otimes y
        &&
     }
   $$


1. the **[[pentagon identity]]**:

   $$
     \array{
       && (w \otimes x) \otimes (y \otimes z)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\alpha_{w \otimes x, y, z}}}\nearrow
        &&
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{\alpha_{w,x,y \otimes z}}}
       \\
       ((w \otimes x ) \otimes y) \otimes z
        && &&
       (w \otimes (x \otimes (y \otimes z)))
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{\alpha_{w,x,y}} \otimes id_z }\downarrow 
        && && 
       \uparrow^{\mathrlap{ id_w \otimes \alpha_{x,y,z} }}
       \\
       (w \otimes (x \otimes y)) \otimes z
         && \underset{\alpha_{w,x \otimes y, z}}{\longrightarrow} &&
       w \otimes ( (x \otimes y) \otimes z )
     }
   $$


=--

As expected, we have the following basic example:

+-- {: .num_example #VectAsAMonoidalCategory} 
###### Example

For $k$ a [[field]], the category [[Vect]]${}_k$ of $k$-[[vector spaces]] becomes a [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) as follows

* the abstract [[tensor product]] is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] $\otimes_k$ from def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces} 

* the [[tensor unit]] is the [[field]] $k$ itself, regarded as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself;

* the [[associator]] is the map that on representing [[tuples]] acts as

  $$
    \alpha_{V_{1}, V_2, V_3} 
       \;\colon\; 
   ((v_1, v_2), v_3) \mapsto (v_1, (v_2,v_3))
  $$

* the left [[unitor]] is the map that on representing [[tuples]] is given by

  $$
    \ell_{V} \colon (k,v) \mapsto k v
  $$

  and the right unitor is similarly given by

  $$
    r_V \colon (v,k) \mapsto k v
    \,.
  $$

That this satisifes the [[pentagon identity]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) and the left and right unit identities is immediate on representing tuples.

=--

But the point of the abstract definition of [[monoidal categories]] is that there are also more exotic examples. The followig one is just a minimal enrichment of example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}, and yet it will be important.

+-- {: .num_example #GradedVectorSpacesAsAMonoidaCategory} 
###### Example

Let $G$ be a [[group]] (or in fact just a [[monoid]]/[[semi-group]]). A **$G$-[[graded vector space]]** $V$ is a [[direct sum]] of vector spaces labeled by the elements in $G$:

$$
  V = \underset{g \in G}{\oplus} V_g
  \,.
$$

A [[homomorphism]] 

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow W
$$

of $G$-graded vector spaces is a [[linear map]] that respects this direct sum structure, hence equivalently a [[direct sum]] of [[linear maps]] 

$$
  \phi_g \;\colon\; V_g \longrightarrow W_g
$$

for all $g \in G$, such that

$$
  \phi = \underset{g \in G}{\oplus} \phi_g
  \,.
$$

This defines a [[category]], denoted $Vect^G$. Equip this category with a [[tensor product]] which on the underlying vector spaces is just the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] from def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}, equipped with the $G$-grading with is obtained by multiplying degree labels in $G$:

$$
  (V \otimes W)_g
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{{g_1, g_2 \in G} \atop {g_1 g_2 = g}}{\oplus}
   V_{g_1} \otimes_k V_{g_2} 
  \,.
$$

The [[tensor unit]] for the tensor product is the ground field $k$, regarded as being in the degree of the [[neutral element]] $e \in G$

$$
  1_g
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      k & | g = e
      \\
      0 & | otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

The [[associator]] and [[unitors]] are just those of the monoidal structure on plain vector spaces, from example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}.

=--

One advantage of abstracting the concept of a [[monoidal category]] is that it allows to prove general statements uniformly for all kinds of tensor products, familar ones and more exotic ones. The following lemma \ref{kel1} and remark \ref{CoherenceForMonoidalCategories} are two important such statements.

+-- {: .num_lemma #kel1} 
###### Lemma 
**([Kelly 64](monoidal+category#Kelly))** 

Let $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ be a [[monoidal category]], def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}. Then the left and right [[unitors]] $\ell$ and $r$ satisfy the following conditions: 

1. $\ell_1 = r_1 \;\colon\; 1 \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 1$;

1. for all objects $x,y \in \mathcal{C}$ the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commutes]]:
 
   $$ 
     \array{
       (1 \otimes x) \otimes y  & & 
       \\
       {}^\mathllap{\alpha_{1, x, y}} \downarrow 
       & \searrow^\mathrlap{\ell_x \otimes id_y} & 
       \\
       1 \otimes (x \otimes y) 
       & \underset{\ell_{x \otimes y}}{\longrightarrow} & x \otimes y
     }
     \,;
   $$ 

   and

   $$ 
     \array{
       x \otimes (y \otimes 1) & & 
       \\
       {}^\mathllap{\alpha^{-1}_{1, x, y}} \downarrow 
       & \searrow^\mathrlap{id_x \otimes r_y} & 
       \\
       (x \otimes y) \otimes 1
         & 
           \underset{r_{x \otimes y}}{\longrightarrow} 
         & 
       x \otimes y
     }
     \,;
   $$

+-- {: .num_remark #CoherenceForMonoidalCategories}
###### Remark

Just as for an [[associative algebra]] it is sufficient to demand $1 a = a$ and $a 1 = a$ and $(a b) c = a (b c)$ in order to have that expressions of arbitrary length may be re-bracketed at will, so there is a _[[coherence theorem for monoidal categories]]_ which states that all ways of freely composing the [[unitors]] and [[associators]] in a [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) to go from one expression to another will coincide. Accordingly, much as one may drop the notation for the bracketing in an [[associative algebra]] altogether, so one may, with due care, reason about monoidal categories without always making all unitors and associators explicit.

(Here the qualifier "freely" means informally that we must not use any non-formal identification between objects, and formally it means that the diagram in question must be in the image of a [[strong monoidal functor]] from a _free_ monoidal category. For example if in a particular monoidal category it so happens that the object $X \otimes (Y \otimes Z)$ is actually _equal_ to $(X \otimes Y)\otimes Z$, then the various ways of going from one expression to another using only associators _and_ this "accidental" equality no longer need to coincide.)

=--

The above discussion makes it clear that a [[monoidal category]] is like a [[monoid]]/[[semi-group]], but "[[categorified]]". Accordingly we may consider additional properties of [[monoids]]/[[semi-groups]] and correspondingly lift them to monoidal categories. A key such property is _[[commutative ring|commutativity]]_. But while for a monoid, commutativity is just an extra [[property]], for a [[monoidal category]] it involves choices of commutativity-[[isomorphisms]] and hence is [[stuff, structure and property|extra structure]]. This might  seem like a subtle point, but in fact, as we will see [below](#SuperGroupsAsSuperHopfAlgebras), this is the very source of [[superalgebra]].

The [[categorification]] of "commutativity" comes in two stages, [[braiding]] and [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric braiding]].

+-- {: .num_defn #BraidedMonoidalCategory} 
###### Definition

A **[[braided monoidal category]]**, is a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) equipped with a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$ 
  \tau_{x,y} \;\colon\; x \otimes y \to y \otimes x 
$$

(for all [[objects]] $x,y in \mathcal{C}$) called the **[[braiding]]**, such that the following two kinds of [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]] for all [[objects]] involved ("hexagon identities"):

$$
  \array{
   (x \otimes y) \otimes z 
   &\stackrel{a_{x,y,z}}{\to}&
   x \otimes (y \otimes z)
   &\stackrel{\tau_{x,y \otimes z}}{\to}&
   (y \otimes z) \otimes x
   \\
   \downarrow^{\tau_{x,y}\otimes Id}
   &&&&
   \downarrow^{a_{y,z,x}}
   \\
   (y \otimes x) \otimes z
   &\stackrel{a_{y,x,z}}{\to}&
   y \otimes (x \otimes z)
   &\stackrel{Id \otimes \tau_{x,z}}{\to}&
   y \otimes (z \otimes x)
  }
$$

and

$$
  \array{
   x \otimes (y \otimes z) 
   &\stackrel{a^{-1}_{x,y,z}}{\to}&
   (x \otimes y) \otimes z
   &\stackrel{\tau_{x \otimes y, z}}{\to}&
   z \otimes (x \otimes y)
   \\
   \downarrow^{Id \otimes \tau_{y,z}}

   (x \otimes z) \otimes y
   &\stackrel{\tau_{x,z} \otimes Id}{\to}&
   (z \otimes x) \otimes y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $a_{x,y,z} \colon (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z)$ denotes the components of the [[associator]] of $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SymmetricMonoidalCategory} 
###### Definition

A **[[symmetric monoidal category]]** is a [[braided monoidal category]] (def. \ref{BraidedMonoidalCategory}) for which the [[braiding]] 

$$ 
   \tau_{x,y} \colon x \otimes y \to y \otimes x 
$$

satisfies the condition:

$$ 
  \tau_{y,x} \circ \tau_{x,y} = 1_{x \otimes y}  
$$

for all objects $x, y$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #SymmetricMonoidalCategoriesCoherenceTheorem}
###### Remark

In analogy to the [[coherence theorem for monoidal categories]] (remark \ref{CoherenceForMonoidalCategories}) there is a [[coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}), saying that every diagram built freely (see remark \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategoriesCoherenceTheorem}) from [[associators]], [[unitors]] and [[braidings]] such that both sides of the diagram correspond to the same [[permutation]] of objects, coincide.

=--

Consider the simplest non-trivial special case of $G$-[[graded vector spaces]] from example \ref{GradedVectorSpacesAsAMonoidaCategory}, the case where $G = \mathbb{Z}/2$ is the [[cyclic group of order two]].

+-- {: .num_example #Z2Zgradedvectorspaces}
###### Example

A **$\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector space]]** is a [[direct sum]] of two vector spaces

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}
  \,,
$$

where we think of $V_{even}$ as the summand that is graded by the [[neutral element]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$, and of $V_{odd}$ as being the summand that is graded by the single non-trivial element. 

A [[homomorphism]] of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded vector spaces

$$
  f \;\colon\; V_1 \longrightarrow V_2
$$

is a [[linear map]] of the underlying vector spaces that respects the grading, hence equivalently a pair of linear maps 

$$
  f_{even} \;\colon\; (V_1)_{even} \longrightarrow (V_1)_{even}
$$

$$
  f_{odd} \;\colon\; (V_1)_{odd} \longrightarrow (V_1)_{odd}
$$

between then summands in evem degree and in odd degree, respectively:

$$
  f = f_{even} \oplus f_{odd}
  \,.
$$

The [[tensor product]] of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded vector space is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] of the underlying vector spaces, but with the grading obtained from multiplying the original gradings in $\mathbb{Z}/2$. Hence

$$
  (V_1 \otimes V_2)_{even}
    \coloneqq
  (V_1)_{even} \otimes (V_2)_{even}
    \oplus
  (V_1)_{odd} \otimes (V_2)_{odd}
$$

and

$$
  (V_1 \otimes V_2)_{odd}
    \coloneqq
  (V_1)_{even} \otimes (V_2)_{odd}
    \oplus
  (V_1)_{odd} \otimes (V_2)_{even}
  \,.
$$

As in example \ref{GradedVectorSpacesAsAMonoidaCategory}, this definition makes $\mathbb{Z}/2$ a [[monoidal category]] def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}.

###### Proposition

There are, up to [[braided monoidal functor|braided monoidal]] [[equivalence of categories]], precisely two choices for a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[braiding]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory})

$$


on the [[monoidal category]] $(Vect_k^{\mathbb{Z}/2}, \otimes_k)$ of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector spaces]] from def. \ref{Z2Zgradedvectorspaces}.

1. the **trivial braiding** whch is the [[natural transformation|natural]] [[linear map]] given on tuples $(v_1,v_2)$ representing an element in $V_1 \otimes V_2$ (according to def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}) by

   $$
     \tau^{triv}_{V_1, V_2} \;\colon\; (v_1,v_2) \mapsto (v_2, v_1)
   $$

1. the **super-braiding** which is the [[natural transformation|natural]] [[linear function]] given on tuples $(v_1,v_2)$ of _homogeneous degree_ (i.e. $v_i \in (V_i)_{\sigma_i} \hookrightarrow V_i$, for $\sigma_i \in \mathbb{Z}/2$) by 

   $$
     \tau^{super}_{V_1, V_2} 
        \;\colon\;
     (v_1, v_2)
        \mapsto
     (-1)^{deg(v_1) deg(v_2)}
     \,
     (v_2,v_1)
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ a [[monoidal category]], write

$$
  (Line(\mathcal{C}), \otimes, 1)
    \hookrightarrow
  (\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)
$$ 

for the [[full subcategory]] on those $L \in \mathcal{C}$ which are [[invertible objects]] under the [[tensor product]], i.e. such that there is an object $L^{-1} \in \mahcal{C}$ with $L \otimes L^{-1} \simeq 1$ and $L^{-1} \otimes L \simeq 1$. Since the [[tensor unit]] is clearly in $Line(L)$ (with $1^{-1} \simeq 1$) and since with $L_1, L_2 \in Line(\mathcal{C}) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ also $L_1 \otimes L_2 \in Line(\mathcal{C})$ (with $(L_1 \otimes _2)^{-1} \simeq L_2^{-1} \otimes L_1^{-1}$) the [[monoidal category]] structure on $\mathcal{C}$ restricts to $Line(\mathcal{C})$. 


Accordingly any [[braiding]] on $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes,1)$ restricts to a braiding on $(Line(\mathcal{C}), \otimes, 1)$. Hence it is sufficient to show that there is an essentially unique non-trivial symmetric braiding on $(Line(\mathcal{C}), \otimes, 1)$, and that this is the restriction of a braiding on $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$.

Now $(Line(\mathcal{C}, \otimes , 1))$ is necessarily a [[groupoid]] (the "[[Picard groupoid]]" of $\mathcal{C}$) and in fact is what is called a _[[2-group]]_. As such we may regard it equivalently as a [[homotopy 1-type]] with group structure, and as such it it is equivalent to its [[delooping]]

$$
  B_\otimes Line(\mathcal{C})
$$

regarded as a [[pointed homotopy type]]. (See at _[[looping and delooping]]_).

The [[Grothendieck group]] of $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ is 

$$
  \pi_0(Line(\mathcal{C}))
    \simeq
  \pi_1(B Line(\mathcal{C}))
$$

the [[fundamental group]] of the delooping space. 

Now a symmetric braiding on $Line(\mathcal{C})$ is precisely the structure that makes it a [[symmetric 2-group]] which is equivalently the structure of a second [[delooping]] $B^2 Line(\mathcal{C})$ (for the braiding) and then a third delooping $B^3 Line(\mathcal{C})$ (for the symmetry), regarded as a [[pointed homotopy type]].

This way we have rephrased the question equivalently as a question about the possible [[k-invariants]] of spaces of this form.

Now in the case at hand, $Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ has precisely two [[isomorphism classes]] of objects, namely the [[ground field]] $k$ itself, regarded as being in even degree and regarded as being in odd degree. We write $k^{1\vert 0}$ and $k^{0 \vert 1}$ for these, respectively. By the rules of the tensor product of [[graded vector spaces]] we have

$$
  k^{1\vert 0} \otimes_k k^{1\vert 0} \simeq k^{1\vert 0}
$$

$$
  k^{1\vert 0} \otimes_k k^{0\vert 1} \simeq k^{0\vert 1}
$$

and

$$
  k^{0 \vert 1} \otimes_k^{0 \vert 1} \simeq k^{1 \vert 0}
  \,.
$$

In other words

$$
  \pi_0(Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/2
  \,.
$$

Now under the above homotopical identification the non-trivial braiding is identified with the elements

$$
  1 =
  k^{1 \vert 0} 
     \simeq 
  k^{0\vert 1} \otimes_k k^{0 \vert 1}
    \stackrel{\tau^{super}_{k^{0\vert 1}, k^{0 \vert 1}}}{\longrightarrow}
  k^{0\vert 1} \otimes_k k^{0\vert 1}
    \simeq
  k^{1 \vert 0}
  = 1  
$$

Due to the symmetry condition, 

$$
  (\tau^{super}_{k^{0\vert 1}, k^{0 \vert 1}})^2 = id
$$

and hence 

$$
  \tau^{super}_{k^{0\vert 1}, k^{0 \vert 1}}
  \in 
  \{+ id, -id\}
  \,.
$$

Therefore for classifying just the symmetric braidings, it is sufficient to restrict the [[hom-spaces]] in $Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ from being either $k$ or empty, to [[hom-sets]] being $\mathbb{Z}/2 = \{+1-1\} \hookrightarrow k$ or empty. Write $\widetilde{Line}(sVect)$ for the resulting [[2-group]].

In conclusion then the [[equivalence classes]] of possible [[k-invariants]] of $B^3 Line(sVect)$, hence the possible symmetric braiding on $Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ are in the degree-4 [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z}/2,3)$ with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$. One finds (...)


$$
  H^4(K(\mathbb{Z}/2, 3), \mathbb{Z}/2)
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbb{Z}/2
  \,.

It has been suggested (in [Kapranov 15](super+algebra#Kapranov15)) that this and other phenomena are evidence that in the wider context of [[homotopy theory]]/[[stable homotopy theory]] super-grading (and hence [[superalgebra]]) is to be regarded as but a shadow of grading in [[higher algebra]] over the [[sphere spectrum]]. Notice that the [[sphere spectrum]] is just the analog of the group of [[integers]] in [[stable homotopy theory]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ClosedMonoidalCategory}
###### Definition

Given a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[tensor product]] $\otimes$ (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}) it is called a **[[closed monoidal category]]** if for each $Y \in \mathcal{C}$ the functor $Y \otimes(-)\simeq (-)\otimes Y$ has a [[right adjoint]], denoted $hom(Y,-)$

$$
  \mathcal{C}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{hom(Y,-)}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{(-) \otimes Y}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

hence if there are [[natural bijections]]

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X \otimes Y, Z)
   \;\simeq\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}{C}(X, hom(Y,Z))
$$

for all objects $X,Z \in \mathcal{C}$. 

Since for the case that $X = 1$ is the [[tensor unit]] of $\mathcal{C}$ this means that

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,hom(Y,Z)) \simeq Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)
  \,,
$$

the object $hom(Y,Z) \in \mathcal{C}$ is an enhancement of the ordinary [[hom-set]] $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)$ to an object in $\mathcal{C}$.
Accordingly, it is also called the **[[internal hom]]** between $Y$ and $Z$.

In a [[closed monoidal category]], the adjunction isomorphism between [[tensor product]] and [[internal hom]] even holds internally:

+-- {: .num_prop #TensorHomAdjunctionIsoInternally}
###### Proposition

In a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]] (def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}) there are [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$
  hom(X \otimes Y, Z)
   \;\simeq\;
  hom(X, hom(Y,Z))
$$

whose image under $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,-)$ are the defining [[natural bijections]] of def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $A \in \mathcal{C}$ be any object. By applying the defining natural bijections twice, there are composite natural bijections

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A , hom(X \otimes Y, Z))
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes (X \otimes Y), Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}((A \otimes X)\otimes Y, Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes X, hom(Y,Z))
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, hom(X,hom(Y,Z)))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since this holds for all $A$, the [[Yoneda lemma]] (the [[fully faithful functor|fully faithfulness]] of the [[Yoneda embedding]]) says that there is an isomorphism $hom(X\otimes Y, Z) \simeq hom(X,hom(Y,Z))$. Moreover, by taking $A = 1$ in the above and using the left [[unitor]] isomorphisms $A \otimes (X \otimes Y) \simeq X \otimes Y$ and $A\otimes X \simeq X$  we get a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,hom(X\otimes Y, ))

If $\epsilon$ and alll $\mu_{x,y}$ are [[isomorphisms]], then $F$ is called a **strong monoidal functor**.

Then for $(A,\mu_A,e_A)$ a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid in]] $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}), its image $F(A) \in \mathcal{D}$ becomes a monoid $(F(A), \mu_{F(A)}, e_{F(A)})$ by setting

###### Definition

Let $(\mathcal{C},\otimes, 1)$ be a [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory})

Then right **[[duality]]** between objects $A, A^\ast \in (\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$

consists of

1. a [[morphism]] of the form

   $$
     ev_A\;\colon\;A^\ast \otimes A \longrightarrow 1
   $$

   called the _counit_ of the duality, or the _[[evaluation]] map_;

1. a [[morphism]] of the form

   $$
     i_A \;\colon\; 1 \longrightarrow A \otimes A^\ast

   called the _unit_ or _coevaluation map_

such that

* ([[triangle identity]]) the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]

  and

  $$

  where $\alpha$ denotes the [[associator]] of the [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$, and $\ell$ and $r$ denote the left and right [[unitors]], respectively.

We say that $A^\ast$ is the right [[dual object]] to $A$. Similarly a left dual for $A$ is an object $A^\ast$ and the structure of $A$ as a right dual of $A^\ast$. If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ is equipped with the structure of a [[braided monoidal category]], then every right dual is canonically also a left dual.

If in a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ every object has a left and right dual, then it is called a **[[rigid monoidal category]]**.

Let

Clearly the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] (def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}) restricts to those of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]], and so there is the induced [[monoidal category]] structure from example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}

$$
  (FinVect_k, \otimes = \otimes_k, 1 = k )

$$
  V^\ast \coloneqq hom(V,k)
$$

is a  [[dual object]] in the abstract sense of def. \ref{DualizableObject}. 

Here the evaluation map is literally the defining [[evaluation]] map of linear duals (whence the name of the abstract concept)

$$
  ev_{V} \;\colon\;  V^\ast \otimes_k V \simeq hom(V,k) \otimes_k k \overset{}{\longrightarrow} k
$$
$$
  ev
    \;\colon\;

  \phi(v)
  \,.
$$

The co-evaluation map 

$$
  i_V
    \;\colon\;
  k \longrightarrow V \otimes V^\ast
$$

is the linear map that sends $1 \in k$ to $id_V \in End(V) \simeq V \otimes_k V^\ast$ under the canonical identification of $V \otimes_k V^\ast$ with the linear space of [[linear map|linear]] [[endomorphisms]] of $V$.

If we choose a [[linear basis]] $\{e_i\}$ for $V$ and a corresponding dual bases $\{e^i\}$ of $V^\ast$, then the evaluation map is given by

$$
  ev \;\colon\; (e^i, e_j) \mapsto e^i(e_j) =  \delta^i_j
$$

(with the [[Kronecker delta]] on the right) and the co-evaluation map is given by

$$
  1 \mapsto \underset{i}{\sum} (e_i,  e^i)
  \,.
$$

In this perspective the [[triangle identities]] are the statements that

$$
  \underset{j}{\sum} e^i(e_j) e^j = e^i
$$

and

$$
  \underset{j}{\sum} e_j e^j(e_i) = e_i
  \,.
$$

Physicists will recognize this as just the basic rules for [[tensor]] calculus in index-notation.

Similarly, the full subcategory

$$

of the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector spaces]] from example \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}, on those of finite total dimension is a [[rigid monoidal category]].

Here we say that a [[super vector space]] $V$ has [[dimension] 

$$
  (p\vert q)
  \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}
$$ 

if its even part has dimension $p$ and its odd part has dimension $q$:

   \;\;\;
   \Leftrightarrow
   \;\;\;
  \left( dim(V_{even}) = p \;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\; dim(V_{odd}) = q \right)

The [[dual object]] of such a finite dimensional super vector space is just the linear [[dual vector space]] as in example \ref{FiniteDimensionalVectorSpaces}, equipped with the evident grading:

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}
  \;\;\;\; \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;\;
  V^\ast = (V_{even}^\ast) \oplus (V_{odd}^\ast)

There are many [[monoidal categories]] whose "[[tensor product]]" operation is quite unlike the [[tensor product of vector spaces]]. Hence one says _[[tensor category]]_ for monoidal categories that are also $k$-[[linear categories]] and such that the tensor product functor  suitably reflects that linear structure.
There are slight variants of what people mean by a "[[tensor category]]". Here we mean precisely the following: 

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorCategory}
###### Definition

For $k$ a [[field]], then a **$k$-[[tensor category]]** $\mathcal{A}$ is an 

1. [[essentially small category|essentially small]]

1. [[linear category|k-linear]] (def. \ref{LinearCategory})

1. [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]] (def. \ref{DualizableObject})

1. [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory})

1. [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory})

such that 

1. the [[tensor product]] functor $\otimes \colon \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is in both arguments separately

   1. $k$-linear (def. \ref{LinearCategory});

   1. [[exact functor|exact]].


1. $End(1) \simeq k$ (the [[endomorphism ring]] of the [[tensor unit]] coincides with $k$).

=--

In this form this is considered in ([Deligne 02, 0.1](#Deligne02)).

We consider now various types of size constraints on tensor categories. The Tannaka reconstructin theorem (theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) only assumes one of them (subexponential growth, def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}), but the others appear in the course of the proof of the theorem.

1. finiteness (def. \ref{FiniteTensorCategory})

1. finite $\otimes$-generation (def. \ref{FiniteTensorGeneration})

1. subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth})

Recall the concept of [[length of an object]] in an [[abelian category]], a generalization of the concept of [[dimension]] of a [[free module]]/[[vector space]]. 


+-- {: .num_defn #FiniteTensorCategory} 
###### Definition

A $k$-[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is called **finite** (over $k$) if 

1. There are only [[finite number|finitely many]] [[simple objects]] in $C$ (hence it is a [[finite abelian category]]), and each of them admits a [[projective presentation]]. 

1. Each object $a$ is of [[object of finite length|finite length]]; 

1. For any two [[objects]] $a$, $b$ of $C$, the [[hom-object]] ($k$-[[vector space]]) $\hom(a, b)$ has [[finite]] [[dimension]];

The category of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] over $k$ is a finite tensor category according to def. \ref{FiniteTensorCategory}. It has a single isomorphism class of [[simple objects]], namely $k$ itself.

The following finiteness condition is useful in the proof of the main theorem, but not necessary for its statement (according to [Deligne 02, bottom of p. 3](#Deligne02)):

+-- {: .num_defn #FiniteTensorGeneration}
###### Definition

A $k$-[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is called _finitely $\otimes$-generated_ if there exists an [[object]] $E \in \mathcal{A}$ such that every other object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ is a [[subquotient]] of a [[direct sum]] of [[tensor products]] $E^{\otimes^n}$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

$$
  \array{
    && \underset{i}{\oplus} E^{\otimes^{n_i}}
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\hookrightarrow& (\underset{i}{\oplus} E^{\otimes^{n_i}})/Q
  }
  \,.
$$

Such $E$ is called an _$\otimes$-generator_ for $\mathcal{A}$.

The following is the main size constraint needed in the theorem. Notice that it is a "mild" constraint at least in the intuitive sense that it states just a minimum assumption on the expected behaviour of dimension ([[length of an object|lengh]]) under tensor powers.

###### Definition

A [[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is said to have _subexponential growth_ if the [[length]] of tensor exponentials is no larger than the exponential of the length: for every [[object]] $X$ there exists a [[natural number]] $N_X$ such that $X$ is of [[length of an object|length]] at most $N_X$, and that also all [[tensor product]] powers of $X$ are of length bounded by the corresponding powers of $N_X$:

$$
  \underset{X \in \mathcal{A}}{\forall}
  \underset{N_X \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}

##### Commutative algebra in tensor categories and Affine super-spaces
 {#CommutativeAlgebraInTensorCategories}

The key idea of [[supercommutative superalgebra]] is that it is nothing but plain [[commutative algebra]] but "[[internalization|internalized]]" not in ordinary [[vector spaces]], but in [[super vector spaces]]. This is made precise by def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory} and ef. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra} below.

The key idea then of [[supergeometry]] is to define super-[[spaces]] to be spaces whose [[algebras of functions]] are [[supercommutative superalgebras]]. This is not the case for any "ordinary" space such as a [[topological space]] or a [[smooth manifold]]. But these spaces may be _characterized_ via their algebras of functions, and hence it makes sense to generalize the latter.

For [[smooth manifolds]] the statement is the following

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition
**([[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]])**

The [[functor]]

$$
  C^\infty(-) \;\colon\; SmoothMfd \longrightarrow Alg_{\mathbb{R}}^{op}
$$

which sends a [[smooth manifold]] ([[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]], [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]], [[second countable topological space|second countable]]) to (the [[formal dual]] of) its $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] is a [[full and faithful functor]].

In other words, for two [[smooth manifolds]] $X,Y$ there is a [[natural bijection]] between the [[smooth functions]] $X \to Y$ and the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] [[homomorphisms]] $C^\infty(X)\leftarrow C^\infty(Y)$.

=--

A **proof** is for instance in ([Kolar-Slovak-Michor 93, lemma 35.8, corollaries 35.9, 35.10](embedding+of+smooth+manifolds+into+formal+duals+of+R-algebras#KolarSlovakMichor93)).

This says that we may _identify_ [[smooth manifolds]] as the  "[[formal duals]]" of certain [[associative algebras]], namely those in the image of the above full embedding. Accordingly then, any larger class of associative algebras than this may be thought of as the class of [[formal duals]] to a generalized kind of manifold, defines thereby. Given any associative algebra $A$, then we think of as representing a space which is such that it has $A$ as its algebra of functions.

The [[duality]] between certain  [[spaces]] and their [[algebras of functions]] is profound. In [[physics]] it has always been used implicitly, in fact it was so ingrained into theoretical physics that it took much effort to abstract away from [[coordinate system|coordinate functions]] to discover global [[Riemannian geometry]] in the guise of"[[general relativity]]". As mathematics, an early prominent duality theorem is [[Gelfand duality]] (between [[topological spaces]] and [[C*-algebras]]) which served as motivation for the very definition of [[algebraic geometry]], where [[affine schemes]] are nothing but the [[formal duals]] of [[commutative rings]]/[[commutative algebras]]. Passing to [[non-commutative algebras]] here yields [[non-commutative geometry]], and so forth. In great generality this duality betwee spaces and their function algebras appears as "[[Isbell duality]]" between [[presheaves]] and [[copresheaves]]. 

In [[supergeometry]] we are concerned with spaces that are formally dual to associative algebras which are "very mildly" non-commutative, namely [[supercommutative superalgebras]], which are in fact [[commutative algebras]] when viewed internal to [[super vector spaces]]. The corresponding [[formal dual]] spaces are, depending on some technical details _[[super schemes]]_ or _[[supermanifolds]]_. In the [[physics]] literature, such spaces are usually just called _[[superspace]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn #MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}

Moreover, if $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes , 1)$ has the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}) $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1, B)$ with symmetric [[braiding]] $\tau$, then a monoid $(A,\mu, e)$ as above is called a **[[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category|commutative monoid in]]** $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1, B)$ if in addition

1. a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded associatiive algebra according to example \ref{GradedAlgebras};

1. such that for any two elements $a, b$ of homogeneous degree, their product satisfies

$$

However, since the definition of not-necessarily commutative monoids does not invoke the [[braiding]] of the ambient [[tensor category]], and since [[super vector spaces]] differ from $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector spaces]] only via their [[braiding]], this yields equivalently just $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded algebras (example \ref{GradedAlgebras}):

+-- {: .num_example #MonoidGivenByTensorUnit}
###### Example

Given a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}), then the [[tensor unit]] $1$ is a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid in]] $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) with product given by either the left or right [[unitor]]

$$
  \ell_1 = r_1 \;\colon\; 1 \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 1

By lemma \ref{kel1}, these two morphisms coincide and define an [[associativity|associative]] product with unit the identity $id \colon 1 \to 1$.

If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes , 1)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}), then this monoid is a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category|commutative monoid]].

  E_1 \otimes E_1 \otimes E_2 \otimes E_2
   \overset{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}{\longrightarrow}
  E_1 \otimes E_2
$$

(where we are notationally suppressing the [[associators]] and where $\tau$ denotes the [[braiding]] of $\mathcal{C}$).

That this definition indeed satisfies associativity and commutativity follows from the corresponding properties of $(E_i,\mu_i, e_i)$, and from the hexagon identities for the braiding (def. \ref{BraidedMonoidalCategory}) and from symmetry of the braiding.

Similarly one checks that for $E_1 = E_2 = E$ then the unit maps

$$
  E \simeq E \otimes 1

  E \otimes E

$$
  E \simeq 1 \otimes E

In the situation of def. \ref{ModulesInMonoidalCategory}, the monoid $(A,\mu, e)$ canonically becomes a left module over itself by setting $\rho \coloneqq \mu$. More generally, for $C \in \mathcal{C}$ any object, then $A \otimes C$ naturally becomes a left $A$-module by setting:

$$
  \rho
  \;\colon\;
  A \otimes (A \otimes C)
   \underoverset{\simeq}{a^{-1}_{A,A,C}}{\longrightarrow}
  (A \otimes A) \otimes C
    \overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes C
  \,.
$$

The $A$-modules of this form are called **[[free modules]]**.

The [[free functor]] $F$ constructing free $A$-modules is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $U$ which sends a module $(N,\rho)$ to the underlying object $U(N,\rho) \coloneqq N$.

$$
  A Mod(\mathcal{C})
    \underoverset
     {\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
     {\overset{F}{\longleftarrow}}
     {\bot}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A homomorphism out of a free $A$-module is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; A\otimes C \longrightarrow N
$$

fitting into the diagram (where we are notationally suppressing the [[associator]])

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A \otimes C
      &\overset{A \otimes f}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes N
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu \otimes id}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A \otimes C
      &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    N
  }
  \,.
$$

Consider the composite

$$
  \tilde f
    \;\colon\;
  C
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\ell_C}{\longrightarrow}
  1 \otimes C
    \overset{e\otimes id}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes C
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  N
  \,,
$$

i.e. the restriction of $f$ to the unit "in" $A$. By definition, this fits into a [[commuting square]] of the form (where we are now notationally suppressing the [[associator]] and the [[unitor]])

$$
  \array{
   A \otimes C
     &\overset{id \otimes \tilde f}{\longrightarrow}&
   A \otimes N
   \\
   {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes e \otimes id}}\downarrow 
     && 
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
   \\
   A \otimes A \otimes C
    &\underset{id \otimes f}{\longrightarrow}&
   A \otimes N
  }
  \,.
$$

Pasting this square onto the top of the previous one yields

$$
  \array{
   A \otimes C
     &\overset{id \otimes \tilde f}{\longrightarrow}&
   A \otimes N
   \\
   {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes e \otimes id}}\downarrow 
     && 
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
    \\
    A \otimes A \otimes C
      &\overset{A \otimes f}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes N
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu \otimes id}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A \otimes C
      &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    N
  }
  \,,
$$

where now the left vertical composite is the identity, by the unit law in $A$. This shows that $f$ is uniquely determined by $\tilde f$ via the relation

$$
  f = \rho \circ (id_A \otimes \tilde f)
  \,.
$$

This natural bijection between $f$ and $\tilde f$ establishes the adjunction.

###### Proposition

Given a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}, def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}), and given $(A,\mu,e)$ a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category|commutative monoid in]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}). If all [[coequalizers]] exist in $\mathcal{C}$, then the [[tensor product of modules]] $\otimes_A$ from def. \ref{TensorProductOfModulesOverCommutativeMonoidObject} makes the [[category of modules]] $A Mod(\mathcal{C})$ into a [[symmetric monoidal category]], $(A Mod, \otimes_A, A)$ with [[tensor unit]] the object $A$ itself, regarded as an $A$-module via prop. \ref{MonoidModuleOverItself}.

If moreover all [[equalizers]] exist, then this is a [[closed monoidal category]] (def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}) with [[internal hom]] given by the function modules $hom_A$ of def. \ref{TensorProductOfModulesOverCommutativeMonoidObject}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof sketch

The associators and braiding for $\otimes_{A}$ are induced directly from those of $\otimes$ and the [[universal property]] of [[coequalizers]]. That $A$ is the tensor unit for $\otimes_{A}$ follows with the same kind of argument that we give in the proof of example \ref{FreeModulesTensorProduct} below.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #FreeModulesTensorProduct}
###### Example

For $(A,\mu,e)$ a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) in a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C},\otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}), the [[tensor product of modules]] (def. \ref{TensorProductOfModulesOverCommutativeMonoidObject}) of two [[free modules]] (def. \ref{MonoidModuleOverItself}) $A\otimes C_1$ and $A \otimes C_2$ always exists and is the free module over the tensor product in $\mathcal{C}$ of the two generators:

$$
  (A \otimes C_1) \otimes_A (A \otimes C_2)
  \simeq
  A \otimes (C_1 \otimes C_2)
  \,.
$$

Hence if $\mathcal{C}$ has all [[coequalizers]], so that the [[category of modules]] is a [[monoidal category]] $(A Mod, \otimes_A, A)$ (prop. \ref{MonoidalCategoryOfModules}) then the free module functor (def. \ref{MonoidModuleOverItself}) is a [[strong monoidal functor]] (def. \ref{LaxMonoidalFunctor})

$$
  F
    \;\colon\;
  (\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)
    \longrightarrow
  (A Mod, \otimes_A, A)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to show that the diagram

$$
  A \otimes A \otimes A
   \underoverset
    {\underset{id \otimes \mu}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\phantom{AAAA}}
  A \otimes A
    \overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}
  A 
$$

is a [[coequalizer]] diagram (we are notationally suppressing the [[associators]]), hence that $A \otimes_A A \simeq A$, hence that the claim holds for $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.

To that end, we check the [[universal property]] of the [[coequalizer]]:

First observe that $\mu$ indeed coequalizes $id \otimes \mu$ with $\mu \otimes id$, since this is just the [[associativity]] clause in def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}. So for $f \colon A \otimes A \longrightarrow Q$ any other morphism with this property, we need to show that there is a unique morphism $\phi \colon A \longrightarrow Q$ which makes this [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi}}
    \\
    Q
  }
  \,.
$$

We claim that 

$$
  \phi 
    \;\colon\;
  A 
    \underoverset{\simeq}{r^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} 
  A \otimes 1 
    \overset{id \otimes e}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes A
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  Q
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is the inverse of the right [[unitor]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

First to see that this does make the required triangle commute, consider the following pasting composite of [[commuting diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes r^{-1}}}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow 
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{r^{-1}}}_{\simeq}
    \\
    A \otimes A \otimes 1 
      &\overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes 1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes e}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \otimes e} }
    \\
    A \otimes A \otimes A 
      &\overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes \mu}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    A \otimes A 
      &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Q
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the the top square is the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the right [[unitor]], the middle square commutes by the functoriality of the tensor product $\otimes \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ and the definition of the [[product category]] (def. \ref{OppositeAndProductOfPointedTopologicallyEnrichedCategory}), while the commutativity of the bottom square is the assumption that $f$ coequalizes $id \otimes \mu$ with $\mu \otimes id$. 

Here the right vertical composite is $\phi$,  while, by [unitality](#UnitalityMonoid) of $(A,\mu ,e)$, the left vertical composite is the identity on $A$, Hence the diagram says that $\phi \circ \mu = f$, which we needed to show.

It remains to see that $\phi$ is the unique morphism with this property for given $f$. For that let $q \colon A \to Q$ be any other morphism with $ q\circ \mu = f$. Then consider the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes 1 &\overset{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id\otimes e}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\simeq}
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
    \\
    A \otimes A &\overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{q}}
    \\
    Q
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top left triangle is the [unitality](#UnitalityMonoid) condition and the two isomorphisms are the right [[unitor]] and its inverse. The commutativity of this diagram says that $q = \phi$.

=--

(e.g. [EKMM 97, VII lemma 1.3](#EKMM97))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, consider a $A$-algebra $E$ with unit $e_E \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow E$ and product $\mu_{E/A} \colon E \otimes_A E \longrightarrow E$. There is the underlying product $\mu_E$ 

$$
  \array{
    E \otimes A \otimes E
    & 
    \underoverset
      {\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\phantom{AAA}}
    &
    E \otimes E
     &\overset{coeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\mu_E}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    && && E
  }
  \,.
$$

By considering a diagram of such coequalizer diagrams with middle vertical morphism $e_E\circ e_A$, one find that this is a unit for $\mu_E$ and that $(E, \mu_E, e_E \circ e_A)$ is a commutative monoid in $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$.

Then consider the two conditions on the unit $e_E \colon A \longrightarrow E$. First of all this is an $A$-module homomorphism, which means that

$$
  (\star)
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{id \otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}& A \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commutes]]. Moreover it satisfies the unit property

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes_A E 
      &\overset{e_A \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    && E
  }
  \,.
$$

By forgetting the tensor product over $A$, the latter gives

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes E 
      &\overset{e \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    A \otimes_A E 
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    E &=& E
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
   \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes E 
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\rho}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E}}}
    \\
    E &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& E  
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top vertical morphisms on the left the canonical coequalizers, which identifies the vertical composites on the right as shown. Hence this may be [[pasting|pasted]] to the square $(\star)$ above, to yield a [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A
     &\overset{id\otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes E 
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow
      &&
    {}^{\mathllap{\rho}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E}}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& E  
  }  
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
   =
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes A 
     &\overset{e_E \otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_E}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that the unit $e_A$ is a homomorphism of monoids $(A,\mu_A, e_A) \longrightarrow (E, \mu_E, e_E\circ e_A)$.

Now for the converse direction, assume that $(A,\mu_A, e_A)$ and $(E, \mu_E, e'_E)$ are two commutative monoids in $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ with $e_E \;\colon\; A  \to E$ a monoid homomorphism. Then $E$ inherits a left $A$-[[module]] structure by

$$
  \rho
    \;\colon\;
  A \otimes E 
    \overset{e_A \otimes id}{\longrightarrow} 
  E \otimes E
    \overset{\mu_E}{\longrightarrow}
  E
  \,.
$$

By commutativity and associativity it follows that $\mu_E$ coequalizes the two induced morphisms $E \otimes A \otimes E \underoverset{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}{\phantom{AA}} E \otimes E$. Hence the [[universal property]] of the [[coequalizer]] gives a factorization through some $\mu_{E/A}\colon E \otimes_A E \longrightarrow E$. This shows that $(E, \mu_{E/A}, e_E)$ is a commutative $A$-algebra.

Finally one checks that these two constructions are inverses to each other, up to isomorphism.

When thinking of commutative monoids in some tensor category as [[formal duals]] to certain [[spaces]], then we are interested in forming [[Cartesian products]] and more generally [[fiber products]] of these spaces. Dually this is given by [[coproducts]] of commutative monoids and commutative $R$-algebras. The following says that these may be computed just as the [[tensor product of modules]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #CoproductsInCMon}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[tensor category]] and let $R \in CMon(\mathcal{A})$ be a [[commutative monoid]] in $\mathcal{A}$, def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}. Then $R CAlg(\mathcal{A})$ has binary [[coproducts]] and these are given by the [[tensor product of modules]] of the underlying $R$-modules.

Dually this means that the [[opposite category]] $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$ has [[finite products]] and hence the structure of a [[Cartesian monoidal category]]:

$$
  Spec(A_1) \times Spec(A_2) \simeq Spec(A_1 \otimes_R A_2)

See at _[CRing -- Properties -- Cocartesian comonoidal structure](CRing#CocartesianComnonoidalStructure)_:





##### (Super-)Groups as (super-)commutative Hopf algebras
 {#GroupsAsHopfAlgebras}

We are interested in [[groups]] equipped with [[geometry]]. 

A familiar example is [[differential geometry]], where one considers groups whose underlying set is promoted to a [[smooth manifold]] and all whose operations (product, inverses) are [[smooth functions]]. These are of course [[Lie groups]]. 

A **[[linear representation]]** of a [[Lie group]] $G$ on a [[vector space]] $V$ is a [[smooth function]]

$$
  \rho \;\colon\; G \times V \longrightarrow V 
$$

such that 

1. ([[linear map|linearity]]) for all elements $g \in G$ the function

   $$
     \rho(g) \colon V \longrightarrow V
   $$

   is a [[linear function]]

1. ([[unitality]]) for $e \in G$ the [[neutral element]] then $\rho(e)$ is the [[identity]] function;

1. ([[action]] property) for $g_1, g_2 \in G$ any two elements, then acting with them consecutively is the same as acting with their product:

   $$
      \rho(g_2) \circ  \rho(g_1) = \rho(g_2 g_1)
      \,.
   $$

But here we need to consider groups with more general geometric structure. The key to the generalization is to regard [[spaces]] dually via their [[algebras of functions]].


In the above example, write $C^\infty(X)$ for the [[smooth algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$. The assignment

$$
  C^\infty(-) \;\colon\; SmthMfd \longrightarrow SmthAlg_{\mathbb{R}}
$$

is a [[contravariant functor]], which is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]].  This means that for 

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

any [[smooth function]], then precomposition of smooth functions on $Y$ with $f$ yields a homomorphism of smooth algebras going the other way around

$$
  C^\infty(X) \longleftarrow C^\infty(Y) \;\colon\; f^\ast
$$

and the associatioon $f \mapsto f^\ast$ is a [[natural bijection]].
Of course, for any two composable smooth functions $f,g$ then $(g \circ f )^\ast = f^\ast \circ g^\ast$ and if $f = id$ is the identity smooth function, then $f^\ast = id$ is the identity homomomorphism of smooth algebras.

Moreover, the functor $C^\infty(-)$ sends [[Cartesian products]] of smooth manifolds to "completed tensor products" $\otimes^c$ of function algebras (namely to the [[coproduct]] of [[smooth algebras]], see there)

$$
  C^\infty(X \times Y) \simeq C^\infty(X) \otimes^c C^\infty(Y)
  \,.
$$

Together this means that if $X = G$ is equipped with the structure of a [[group object]], then the product operation in the group induces a "[[coproduct]]" operation on its smooth algebra of smooth functions:

$$
  \array{
    product &\colon& G \times G &\longrightarrow& G
    \\
    && C^\infty(G) \otimes^c C^\infty(G) &\longleftarrow& C^\infty(G) &\colon& product^\ast 
  }
  \,.
$$

Now the [[associativity]] of the group product translates into a corresponding dual property of its dual, called "[[co-associativity]]", and so forth. The resulting algebraic structure is called a **[[Hopf algebra]]**.
 

While the explicit definition of a _[[Hopf algebra]]_ may look involved at first sight, Hopf algebras are simply [[formal duals]] of [[groups]]. Since this perspective is straightforward, we may just as well consider it in the generality of [[groupoids]].

A simple illustrative archetype of the following construction of commutative Hopf algebroids from homotopy commutative ring spectra is the following situation:

For $X$ a [[finite set]] consider

$$
  \array{
    X \times X \times X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\circ = (pr_1, pr_3)}}
    \\
    X \times X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s = pr_1}}\downarrow 
     \uparrow 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{t = pr_2}}
    \\
    X
  }  
$$

as the ("[[codiscrete groupoid|codiscrete]]") [[groupoid]] with $X$ as [[objects]] and precisely one morphism from every object to every other. Hence the [[composition]] operation $\circ$, and the [[source]] and [[target]] maps are simply projections as shown. The identity morphism (going upwards in the above diagram) is the [[diagonal]].

Then consider the image of this structure under forming the [[free abelian groups]] $\mathbb{Z}[X]$, regarded as [[commutative rings]] under pointwise multiplication.

Since 

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[X \times X]
    \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]
$$

this yields a diagram of homomorphisms of commutative rings of the form

$$
  \array{
    (\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X] )
      \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[X]}
    (\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X])
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{} }
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]
    \\
    \uparrow 
     \downarrow 
    \uparrow
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}[X]
  }  
$$

satisfying some obvious conditions. Observe that here

1. the two morphisms $\mathbb{Z}[X] \rightrightarrows \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]$ are $f \mapsto f \otimes e$ and $f \mapsto e \otimes f$, respectively, where $e$ denotes the unit element in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$;

1. the morphism $\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X] \to \mathbb{Z}[X]$ is the multiplication in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[X]$;

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}).
A **[[commutative Hopf algebroid]]** in $\mathcal{A}$ is an [[internal groupoid]] in the [[opposite category]] $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$ of [[commutative monoids]] in $\mathcal{A}$, regarded with its [[cartesian monoidal category]] structure according to prop. \ref{CoproductsInCMon}.

+-- {: .num_prop #CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}
###### Proposition


An [[internal category]] in $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$ is a [[diagram]] in $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    Spec(\Gamma) \underset{Spec(A)}{\times} Spec(\Gamma)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\circ}}
    \\
    Spec(\Gamma)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s}}\downarrow \; \uparrow^{\mathrlap{i}} \downarrow^{\mathrlap{t}}
    \\
    Spec(A)
  }
  \,,
$$

(where the [[fiber product]] at the top is over $s$ on the left and $t$ on the right) such that the pairing $\circ$ defines an [[associativity law|associative]] [[composition]] over $Spec(A)$, [[unitality|unital]] with respect to $i$. This is an [[internal groupoid]] if it is furthemore equipped with a morphism

$$
  inv \;\colon\; Spec(\Gamma) \longrightarrow Spec(\Gamma)
$$

acting as assigning [[inverses]] with respect to $\circ$.

The key basic fact to use now is prop. \ref{CoproductsInCMon} the [[tensor product]] of commutative monoids exhibits the [[cartesian monoidal category]] structure on $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$, :
$$
  Spec(R_1) \underset{Spec(R_3)}{\times} Spec(R_2) 
  \simeq
  Spec(R_1 \otimes_{R_3} R_2)
  \,.
$$

This means that def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid} is equivalently a diagram in $CMon(\mathcal{A})$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma \underset{A}{\otimes} \Gamma
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi}}

###### Remark

Generally, in a commutative Hopf algebroid, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, the two morphisms $\eta_L, \eta_R\colon A \to \Gamma$ from remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut} need not coincide, they make $\Gamma$ genuinely into a [[bimodule]] over $A$, and it is the [[tensor product]] of [[bimodules]] that appears in remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}. But it may happen that they coincide:

An [[internal groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_1 \stackrel{\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{t}{\longrightarrow}}$ for which the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] morphisms coincide, $s = t$, is euqivalently a [[group object]] in the [[slice category]] over $\mathcal{G}_0$.

Dually, a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma \stackrel{\overset{\eta_L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\eta_R}{\longleftarrow}} A$ for which $\eta_L$ and $\eta_R$ happen to coincide is equivalently a **commutative [[Hopf algebra]]** $\Gamma$ over $A$.

of the fact in def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid} that identity morphisms respect sources:

##### Deligne's Tannaka duality for tensor categories

Deligne's theorem on tensor categories ([Deligne 02](#Deligne02), recalled as theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) establishes [[Tannaka duality]] between linear [[tensor categories]] in [[characteristic zero]] subject to just a mild size constraint (subexponential growth, def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth} below), and [[supergroups]] ("[[supersymmetries]]"), realizing these tensor categories as [[categories of representations]] of these supergroups.

Since the concept of linear [[tensor categories]] arises very naturally in [[mathematics]], the theorem gives a purely mathematical "reason" for the relevance of [[superalgebra]] and [[supergeometry]]. It is reasonable to wonder why of all possible generalizations of [[commutative algebra]], it is [[supercommutative superalgebras]] that are singled out (from alternatives such as plain $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded algebras]], or in fact $\mathbb{Z}/n$-graded algebras or general [[noncommutative algebras]] or, the like), as they are notably in theoretical [[physics]] ("[[supersymmetry]]"), but also in mathematical fields such as [[spin geometry]] (e.g. via the relation between [[Majorana spinors]] and supersymmetry, [here](Majorana+spinor#Supersymmetry)) and [[topological K-theory]] (for instance via its incarnation as _[[Karoubi K-theory]]_, or via the descriptioon of [[twisted K-theory]] by _[[super line 2-bundles]]_). 

But with $k$-linear [[tensor categories]] appearing on general abstract grounds as the canonical structure to consider in [[representation theory]], Deligne's theorem serves to base supercommutative superalgebra on this same general abstract foundation, showing that this is precisely the context in which full $k$-linear tensor categories exhibit full [[Tannaka duality]].

More concretely, in [[quantum field theory]], under the [[Wigner classification]], [[fundamental particles]] are identified with [[irreducible representations]] of the [[isometry group]] of the local model of [[spacetime]]. Forming the [[tensor product]] of two such representations corresponds to combining them as two [[subsystems]] of a joint system. Therefore it is natural to demand that physical particle species should form complex-linear [[tensor categories]]. Deligne's theorem then gives that [[supersymmetry]] is the most general context in which this works out. (In physics the irreducible representation in this context here are called the _[[supermultiplets]]_.)

Recall the following from the discussion at _[[geometry of physics -- smooth sets]]_. We will set up [[supergeometry]] in direct analogy to this formulation of plain [[differential geometry]]. See also at _[[geometry of physics -- manifolds and orbifolds]]_ and _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_.


+-- {: .num_defn #SiteCartSp}
###### Definition

Write [[CartSp]] for the [[category]] of [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \in\mathbb{N}$ with [[smooth functions]] between them. Say that a collection of morphisms $\{U_i \to X\}$ in $CartSp$ is [[covering]] if this is a [[good open cover]] in that every finite non-empty intersection of the charts is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to a Cartesian space.

###### Remark

We may think of this as the category of abstract [[coordinate systems]] on which [[differential geometry]] is to be modeled, see at _[[geometry of physics -- coordinate systems]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn #Smooth0Type}
###### Definition

We say a _[[smooth set]]_ or _smooth 0-type_ is a [[sheaf]] on $CartSp$, write

$$
 Smooth0Type \coloneqq Sh(CartSp) 
$$

for the [[sheaf topos]] of all these.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The useful way to think of def. \ref{Smooth0Type} in the present context is as defining a kind of [[generalized smooth space]] which is _defined_ by which smooth functions from Cartesian spaces it receives (see also at _[[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]]_ for more exposition of this point).

Under the [[Yoneda embedding]] 

$$
  CartSp \hookrightarrow Smooth0Type
$$

every Cartesian space $X$ is naturally regarded as a smooth space itself, namely the one it [[representable functor|represents]] by the assignment

$$
  X \colon \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n ,X)
  \,.
$$

Hence the set that the Cartesian space $X$, regarded as a sheaf, assigns to a coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ is just the set of all ways of mapping that coordinate system smoothly into $X$.

Hence given any $X \in Smooth0Type$, we are entitled to think of it as a [[generalized smooth space]] which need not be given as a [[set]] equipped with [[smooth structure]], but whose nature instead we detect or _probe_ by mapping Cartesian spaces into it: given  $\mathbb{R}^n$ then we think of the set $X(\mathbb{R}^n)$, which the sheaf $X$ assigns, as playing the role of the set of all smooth functions "$\mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow X$" into the would-be space $X$. 

The [[Yoneda lemma]] gives that this is not circular, but consistent: once we identify Cartesian spaces themselves as smooth spaces via the [[Yoneda embedding]], then the previous statement becomes literally true and we may remove the quotation marks:

$$
  X(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \simeq
  \left\{
    morphisms\;of\;smooth\;spaces\;
    \mathbb{R}^n \to X
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

The strategy is then to work with this nice category (a [[topos]]) of [[smooth spaces]], and find in their [[subcategories]] of more specific objects having extra properties which one may need in given applications:

###### Remark

One has to be careful that prop. \ref{EmbeddingOfSmoothManifoldsIntoFormalDualsOfRAlgebras} might seem to imply more than it does. In order that all constructions on all commutative algebras have the desired dual effect on formally dual smooth spaces (e.g. construction of [[products]]/[[coproducts]], or construction of [[Kähler differentials]]) one needs to refine plain commutative algebras over $\mathbb{R}$ to _[[smooth algebras]]_. See there for more on this point, which however for our purposes here is not of further concern.

It is an observation from [[experiment]] (from the [[Stern-Gerlach experiment]] via the [[spin-statistics theorem]]), that spaces of [[physical fields]] for [[physical theories]] that contain [[fermions]] behave as if they have [[algebras of functions]] which are not quite [[commutative algebras]], but where the functions depending on the [[fermions]] only commute with each other up to picking up a minus sign.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The even-degree part $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})_{even}$ is an ordinary [[commutative algebra]], but if $q \geq 1$ then it is not the algebra of functions on any [[smooth manifold]], because it has a non-trivial [[nilpotent ideal]]. Instead, a nilpotent element of an [[algebra of functions]] may be thought of as a function depending on an _infinitesimal direction_.

For instance $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{0|2})_{even}$ is isomorphic to what is known as the [[algebra of dual numbers]] $(\mathbb{R}\oplus \epsilon \mathbb{R})/(\epsilon^2)$ with $\epsilon = \theta^1 \theta^2$.

This is traditionally more familiar from the theory of [[formal schemes]], but the same kind of general abstract theory goes through in the context of [[differential geometry]], a point of view known as _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_.
 
But this means that in passing to commutative superalgebras there are _two_ stages of generalizations of plain differential geometry involved:

1. [[smooth manifolds]] are generalized to [[formal smooth manifolds]];

1. [[formal smooth manifolds]] are further generalized to formal smooth [[supermanifolds]].

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Write $\mathbb{D}$ for the [[formal dual]] of the [[algebra of dual numbers]]. Then morphisms


$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{D}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which are the identity after restriction along $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{D}$, are equivalently algebra homomorphisms of the form


$$
  (C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \oplus \epsilon C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n))
  \longleftarrow
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

which are the identity modulo $\epsilon$. Such a morphism has to take any function $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to 

$$
  f + (\partial f) \epsilon
$$

for some smooth function $(\partial f) \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The condition that this assignment makes an algebra homomorphism is equivalent to the statement that for all $f_1,f_2 \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$

$$
  (f_1 f_2 + (\partial (f_1 f_2))\epsilon )
  =
  (f_1 + (\partial f_1) \epsilon)
  (f_2 + (\partial f_2) \epsilon)
  \,.
$$

Multiplying this out and using that $\epsilon^2 = 0$ this in turn is equivalent to

$$
  \partial(f_1 f_2) = (\partial f_1) f_2 + f_1 (\partial f_2)
  \,.
$$

This in turn means equivalently that $\partial\colon C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)\to C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a [[derivation]]. But derivations of algebras of [[smooth functions]] are equivalent to [[vector fields]]. (See at _[[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]]_).

In particular one finds that maps

$$
  \mathbb{D} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$

are equivalently single [[tangent vectors]].

#### Super differential forms
 {#DeRhamComplexOfSuperDifferentialForms}

Recall from def. \ref{SuperCartesianSpace}:

A [[super Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ is the [[formal dual]]
of the [[commutative superalgebra]] 

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
  \coloneqq 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p)\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{R}^q
$$

in that a smooth function 
$\mathbb{R}^{p_1|q_1}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p_2|q_2}$
is equivalently (by definition!) a superalgebra homomorphism

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p_1|q_1})
  \longleftarrow
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p_2|q_2})
  \,.
$$

Notice then that from knowledge of an [[algebra of functions]]
one obtains the corresponding [[de Rham complex]] by the idea
of [[Kähler differentials]]. As discussed there, this statement requires
a little care in the smooth context, but the result is still
immediate:

For $\mathbb{R}^n$ a [[Cartesian space]], then its [[de Rham complex]] is the $\mathbb{Z}$-graded commutative [[dg-algebra]] whose underlying $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded vector space]] is

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^p)
  =
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \wedge^\bullet \langle \mathbf{d}x^1, \cdots, \mathbf{d}x^p\rangle
$$

and whose [[differential]] is defined in degree-0 by

$$
  \mathbf{d} f \coloneqq \sum_{i = 1}^p \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \mathbf{d}x^i
$$

and extended from there to all degree by the graded Leibnitz rule.

It is immediate to generalize this to the super-context, one just needs to be sure to apply the [[signs in supergeometry|sign rule]] throughout.

###### Remark

We may write 

$$
  (n,\sigma)\in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_2
$$ 

for elements in this bigrading group. 

In this notation the grading of the elements in $\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})$ is all induced by the fact that the de Rham differential $\mathbf{d}$ itself is a [[derivation]] of degree $(1,even)$.

| generator | bi-degree |
|--|--|
| $x^a$ | (0,even) |
| $\theta^\alpha$ | (0,odd) |
| $\mathbf{d}$ | (1,even) |

Here the last line means that we have

| generator | bi-degree |
|--|--|
| $x^a$ | (0,even) |
| $\theta^\alpha$ | (0,odd) |
| $\mathbf{d}x^a$ | (1,even) |
| $\mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha$ | (1,odd) |


The formula for the "cohomologically- and super-graded commutativity" in $\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})$ is 

$$
  \alpha \wedge \beta 
  = 
  \;
  (- 1)^{n_\alpha n_\beta + \sigma_\alpha \sigma_\beta}
  \;
  \beta \wedge \alpha
$$

for all $\alpha,  \beta \in \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})$ of homogeneous $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}_2$-degree. Hence there are _two_ contributions to the sign picked up when exchanging two super-differential forms in the wedge product:

1. there is a "cohomological sign" which for commuting a $n_1$-forms past an $n_2$-form is $(-1)^{n_1 n_2}$;

1. in addition there is a "super-grading" sich which for commuting a $\sigma_1$-graded coordinate function past a $\sigma_2$-graded coordinate function (possibly under the de Rham differential) is $(-1)^{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}$.

extended uniquely as a graded [[derivation]] on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$.

Given a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, then

equivalently a dg-algebra homomorphims

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^p)

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

With a choice of basis as in remark \ref{CEAlgebraInTermsOfBasis}, then the content of prop. \ref{LieAlgValuedFormsViaDgAlgHoms} is seen in components as follows:

a dg-algebra homomorphism is first of all a homomorphism of [[graded algebras]], and since the domain $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is free as a graded algebra, such is entirely determined by what it does to the generators

$$
  \array{
    t^a, &\mapsto& A^a & \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \\ 
    r^a &\mapsto& F^a & \in \Omega^2(\mathbb{R}^n)
  }
  \,.
$$

But being a dg-algebra homomorphism, this assignment needs to respect the differentials on both sides. For the original generators this gives

$$
  \array{
    t^a &\mapsto&&&  A^a
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}}} &&&& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{d}_{dR}}}
    \\
    - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c
    + r^a
    &\mapsto&
    (- \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} A^b \wedge A^c + F^a)
    &=&
    \mathbf{d}_{dR} A^a 
  }
  \,.
$$

With this satisfied, then, by the very nature of the [[Weil algebra]],
the differential is automatically respected also on the shifted generators. This statement is the _[[Bianchi identity]]_.

(with differential $d$ of degree (1,even))
such that the underlying graded algebra is the super Grassmann algebra
$\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ via def. \ref{SuperGrassmannAlgebra}.

We call this again the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the super Lie algebra
dually defined thereby.

Similarly, the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is obtained from this by adding a generator in degree $(2,\sigma)$ for each previous generator in degree $(1,\sigma)$ and extending the differential as in def. \ref{WeilForLInfinitityAlgebra}.

###### Definition


Given a [[super Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, def. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraViaCE}, prop. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraTraditional}, then a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued super-differential form on the [[super Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ is a $(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_2)$-graded dg-algebra homomorphism

from the [[Weil algebra]] according to def. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraViaCE}, to the super de Rham complex of def. \ref{SuperDeRhamComplex}.

Accordingly we write

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}, \mathfrak{g})

  Hom_{dgAlg}(W(\mathfrak{g}), \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}))

Let $\mathfrak{g} \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^{1|0} = \mathbb{R}$ be the ordinary abelian [[line Lie algebra]].
Then

$$

  \simeq
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})_{even}

is the set of super-differential forms in degree $(1,even)$.

Similarly with $\mathfrak{g} = \mathbb{R}^{0|1}$ the [[odd line]] regarded as an abelian super Lie algebra, then

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}, \mathbb{R}^{0|1})

So generally for $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary Lie algebra regarded as a super Lie algebra, then $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}, \mathfrak{g})$ is bigger than $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^p,\mathfrak{g})$.

This is an issue to be dealt with when describing [[supergravity]] in terms of Cartan fields on [[supermanifolds]] $X$, because the actual [[spacetime]] manifold one cares about is just the [[bosonic modality|bosonic part]] $\stackrel{\rightsquigarrow}{X}$.

$$
  \left(

    ,
    [-,-]

$$ 

that extends the [[Poincaré Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})$ by some odd-[[graded vector space]] $N$. Any such extension involves involves:

1. the even-odd superbracket $[\mathfrak{so},N]$, which hence is an [[action]] of the [[Lorentz Lie algebra]] on  $N$;

1. the even-even-odd [[Jacobi identity]], which is the action property of that action;

1. the odd-odd superbracket $[N,N]$ which is a _symmetric_ [[bilinear form]] $N \otimes N \to \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$

1. the even-odd-odd [[Jacobi identity]], which says that this bilinear form is $\mathfrak{o}(d-1,1)$-[[equivariance|equivariant]].

#### Poincar&#233; connections: Graviton and gravitino field
 {#GravitonAndGravitino}

We may now apply the general discussion of super Lie algebra valued super differential forms, def. \ref{SuperLieAlgValuedDiffForms}, to the case of the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]], def. \ref{SuperPoincareAndSuperMinkowski}.

its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N}))$ is generated on 

* elements $\{e^a\}$ and $\{\omega^{ a b}\}$ of degree $(1,even)$

* and elements $\{\psi^\alpha\}$ of degree $(1,odd)$

with the differential defined by

$$
  d_{CE} \, \omega^{a b} = \omega^a{}_b \wedge \omega^{b c}
$$

$$
  d_{CE} \, e^{a } = \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b + \frac{i}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi
$$

$$
  d_{CE} \, \psi = \frac{1}{4} \omega^{ a b} \Gamma_{a b} \psi
  \,.
$$

Accordingly its [[Weil algebra]] 
$W(\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N}))$
has these generators together with a further degree-shifted copy of each $\{t^a\}$, $\{r^{a b}\}$ and $\{\rho^{\alpha}\}$ with differential given by

$$
  d_{W} \, \omega^{a b} = \omega^a{}_b \wedge \omega^{b c} + r^{a b}
$$

$$
  d_{W} \, e^{a } = \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b + \frac{i}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi + t^a
$$

$$
  d_{W} \, \psi = \frac{1}{4} \omega^{ a b} \Gamma_{a b} \psi + \rho
  \,.
$$


Differential form data with values in this is a morphism of [[dg-algebras]] from the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N}))$ to the [[deRham dg-algebra]] $\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})$, def. \ref{SuperDeRhamComplex}

This is [[∞-Lie algebroid valued differential form]] data with [[curvature|∞-Lie algebroid valued curvature]] that is explicitly given by:

Discarding the terms involving $\omega$ here this is the CE algebra of the [[super translation algebra]] underlying [[super Minkowski spacetime]].

In this way the super-Poincar&#233; Lie algebra and its extensions is usefully discussed for instance in ([D'Auria-Fr&#233; 82](#DAuriaFre82)) and in ([Azc&#225;rraga-Townsend 89](super+Minkowski+spacetime#AzcarragaTownsend89), [CAIB 99](super+Minkowski+spacetime##CAIB99)). In much of the literature instead the following equivalent notation is popular, which more explicitly involves the [[coordinates]] on [[super Minkowski space]].

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The abstract generators in def. \ref{CEAlgebraOfSuperPoincare} are identified with [[left invariant 1-forms]] on the [[super-translation group]] (= [[super Minkowski space]]) as follows.

Let $(x^a, \theta^\alpha)$ be the canonical [[coordinates]] on the [[supermanifold]] $\mathbb{R}^{d|N}$ underlying the super translation group. Then the identification is 

* $\psi^\alpha = d \theta^\alpha$.

* $e^a = d x^a +  \overline{\theta} \Gamma^a d \theta$.

Notice that this then gives the above formula for the differential of the [[super-vielbein]] in def. \ref{CEAlgebraOfSuperPoincare} as

$$ 
  \begin{aligned}
    d e^a & = d (d x^a +  \overline{\theta} \Gamma^a d \theta)
    \\
    & =  d \overline{\theta}\Gamma^a d \theta
    \\
    & =  \overline{\psi}\Gamma^a \psi
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$


=--


+-- {: .num_remark #Supertorsion}
###### Remark

The term $\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi$ is sometimes called the *[[supertorsion]]* of the [[super-vielbein]] $e$, because the defining equation

$$
  d_{CE} e^{a } -\omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b = \bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi
$$

may be read as saying that $e$ is [[torsion]]-free except for that term. Notice that this term is the only one that appears when the differential is applied to "Lorentz scalars", hence to object in $CE(\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}))$ which have "all indices contracted". See also at _[[torsion constraints in supergravity]]_.

Notably we have 

$$
  d \left( 
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
  \right)
  \propto
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_{p-1}}
  \right)
  \wedge
  \left(
    \overline{\Psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_p} \Psi
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This remaining operation "$e \mapsto \Psi^2$" of the differential acting on Loretz scalars is sometimes denoted "$t_0$", e.g. in ([Bossard-Howe-Stelle 09, equation (8)](super+Minkowski+spacetime#BossardHoweStelle09)).

This relation is what govers all of the exceptional super Lie algebra cocycles that appear [below](#TheOldBraneScan): for some combinations of $(d,p,N)$ a [[Fierz identity]] implies that the term

$$
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_{p-1}}
  \right)
  \wedge
  \left(
    \overline{\Psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_p} \Psi
  \right)
$$

vanishes identically, and hence in these dimensions the term

$$
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
$$

is a [[cocycle]] in super [[Lie algebra cohomology]].

#### Cohomology of super-Minkowski spacetime

The [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] which in def. \ref{CEAlgebra} and def. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraViaCE} we used to _characterize_ the corresponding (super) Lie algebras are of course traditionally introduced as the [[cochain complexes]] whose [[cochain cohomology]] is [[Lie algebra cohomology]]. We may conceptualize this as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn #SiteCartSp}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]$ for the _[[line Lie n-algebra|line Lie (n+1)-algebra]]_, the [[super L-infinity algebra]] defined simply as the [[formal dual]] to the $(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_2)$-graded commutative [[dg-algebra]]

$$
  CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]) \coloneqq
  \left(
    \wedge^\bullet \mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n],
    \;
    d = 0
  \right)
$$

whose underlying [[graded algebra]] is freely generated from a single generator in degree $(n,even)$, and whose differential vanishes.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #LieAlgebraCohomologAsHomomorphism}
###### Remark

Recall that being a "[[formal dual]]" to a dg-algebra here simply means that for $\mathfrak{g}$ any [[super Lie algebra]], the homomorphisms of [[super L-infinity algebras]] of the form

$$
  \mu \;\colon\; \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]
$$

are equivalently (by definition!) homomorphisms of [[dg-algebras]] of the form

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \longleftarrow
  CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])
  \,.
$$ 

Since the underlying graded algebra of $CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])$ is free on a single generator $c$ in degree $n+1$, such a homomorphism is determined by the image of this generator

$$
  c \mapsto \mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the condition that this map respects the differentials, and since the differential on $CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])$ vanishes by definition, this means that

$$
  \array{
     c &\mapsto& && \mu
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_{\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]}}}
     && &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_{\mathfrak{g}}}}
     \\
     0 &\mapsto& 0 &=& d_{\mathfrak{g}}\mu
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence such a moprhism $\mu$ is equivalently a _closed_ element of degree $(n+1)$ in $CE(\mathfrak{g})$, hence is equivalently a [[Lie algebra cohomology|super Lie algebra cocycle]] of degree $n+1$ on $\mathfrak{g}$.

This way [[line Lie n-algebra|line Lie (n+1)-algebra]] $\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]$ is the _[[moduli stack|moduli object]]_ for degree-$(n+1)$ Lie algebra cohomology in direct [[analogy]] of how for instance the familiar [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $B^{n+1}\mathbb{R} = K(\mathbb{Z},n+1)$ is the classifying space for degree $n+1$ [[ordinary cohomology]] of [[topological spaces]].

=--

One advantange of conceptualizing Lie algebra cocycles as in remark \ref{LieAlgebraCohomologAsHomomorphism} is that it neatly connects to the formulation of [[Lie algebra valued forms]] according to def. \ref{LieAlgValuedFormsViaDgAlgHoms}, def. \ref{SuperLieAlgValuedDiffForms}:


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A $\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]$-valued differential form is simply an even closed differential $(n+1)$-form:

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}, \mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])
  \simeq
  Hom(CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]), \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}))
  \simeq
  \Omega^{n+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})_{even,closed}
  \,.
$$

Hence a super Lie algebra $(n+1)$-cocycle $\mu$ on 
$\mathfrak{g}$ naturally determines a map


$$
  \mu(-)
  \colon
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q},\mathfrak{g})
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{n+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})_{even,closed}
$$

given by forming the composite with the morphism representing the cocycle $\mu$

$$
  \left(
    \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
     \stackrel{A}{\longleftarrow}
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
   \stackrel{A}{\longleftarrow}
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\mu^\ast}{\longleftarrow}
  CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])
  \right)
$$

sending a [[Lie algebra valued form]] $A$ to a closed differential form $\mu(A)$.

One finds that the elements $\mu_{p+2}$ in def. \ref{ThePsiPsiTermsInCEOfSuperMinkowski} are CE-closed, hence are super Lie algebra cocycles for given $(d,p,N)$, precisely if there is a [[super p-brane]] in $N$-supersymmetric super-Minkowski spacetime on which no other super $p$-brane may end.

##### The full brane scan 

Every Lie algebra cocycle $\mu_{p+2} \colon \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}$ induces a [[L-∞ algebra cohomology|higher extension]] of its domain, namely the [[Lie n-algebra|Lie (p+1)-algebra]] $\hat \mathfrak{g}$ which is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mu_{p+2}$ in the [[homotopy theory of L-∞ algebras]]:

$$
  \array{
     \hat \mathfrak{g}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathfrak{g}
     &\stackrel{\mu_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&
     b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

For the cocycles on [[super Minkowski spacetime]] from the [old brane scan](#TheOldBraneScan) these extensions are known as _[[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]]_.

$$
  \array{
     \hat \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
     &\stackrel{\mu_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&
     b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

Now the extended super Minkowski spacetime $\hat \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ may carry further cocycles, that do not come from ordinary super Minkowski spacetime. Including these yields the full brane scan.

This complete brane scan is no longer just a table, but is a tree, a bouquet, where each edge is an $L_\infty$-extension.

As a mathematical statement prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} is originally due to ([D'Auria-Fr&#233; 82, p.18](#DAuriaFre82)), where it is considered as an ingredient for constructing the [[action functional]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] in the [[D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity]]. The statement has been rediscovered in ([BLNPST 97, (9)](#BLNPST97)), finding its interpretation as giving the [[geometry of physics -- WZW terms|WZW term]] of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] for the [[M5-brane]].


+-- {: .num_defn #m2braneLie3Algebra}
###### Definition

Write $\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane} \in sL_\infty Alg$ for the [[super L-∞ algebra]] which is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mu_4$ in prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski}.

$$
  \array{
     \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}
     &\stackrel{\mu_4}{\longrightarrow}&
     b^3 \mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

and specifically for the representive of this homotopy fiber which, by the [recognition theorem for L-∞ extensions](model+structure+for+L-infinity+algebras#HomotopyFiberProducts), is given by having the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] 

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) = (CE(\mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}})\otimes \langle h_3\rangle, d h_3 = -\mu_4)
  \,.
$$

=--

In terms of def. \ref{m2braneLie3Algebra}, the second item in prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} reads as follows:


+-- {: .num_cor #The7CocycleOnm2brane}
###### Corollary

There is a super $L_\infty$-cocycle of the form

$$
  \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}
  \stackrel{h_3 \wedge \mu_4 + \frac{1}{15} \mu_7}{\longrightarrow}
  b^6 \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

=--

But since $\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}$ is a $b^2 \mathbb{R}$-[[principal ∞-bundle]], it is natural to ask whether $h_3 \wedge \mu_4 + \frac{1}{15} \mu_7$ is $b^2 \mathbb{R}$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] with respect to some natural $b^2\mathbb{R}$-[[∞-action]] on $b^6 \mathbb{R}$. Such a natural action is given by prop. \ref{b2RactionOnb2p2R}. To exhibit in components the equivariance of the 7-cocycle in corollary \ref{The7CocycleOnm2brane} with respect to this action we need a [[resolution]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]]:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $\mathbb{R}_{res}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}$ for the [[super L-∞ algebra]] whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is obtained from that of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] by


$$
  CE\left(
   \mathbb{R}_{res}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}
  \right)
  \coloneqq
  \left(
   CE\left(
     \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}\right)\otimes \left\langle h_3, g_4\right\rangle ,
     {{d h_3 = g_4 - \mu_4} \atop {d g_4 = 0}}

###### Proposition

The canonical morphism

$$
  \mathbb{R}_{res}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}
$$

given dually by $\psi^\alpha \mapsto \psi^\alpha$, $e^a \mapsto e^a$, is an equivalence of $L_\infty$-algebras. It factors the morphism $\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}$ from def. \ref{m2braneLie3Algebra} through a morphism $\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}  \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}_{res}$ which on [[nLab:formal dual]] CE-elements is given by $h_3 \mapsto 0$, $g_4 \mapsto 0$ and by being the identity on all other generators.

###### Proposition

There is a [[diagram]] of [[L-∞ algebras]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && \vdots && && \vdots
    \\
    && \downarrow \downarrow && && \downarrow \downarrow
    \\
    &&
    \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane} 
    &&
      \stackrel{h_3 \wedge \mu_4  + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7 }{\longrightarrow}
    &&
    b^6 \mathbb{R}
    \\
    &&
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert\mathbf{32}}
    &\stackrel{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}&
    \mathbb{R}_{res}^{10,1\vert\mathbf{32}} 
    && 
      \stackrel{h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7 }{\longrightarrow}
    && 
    b^6 \mathbb{R}/b^2 \mathbb{R}
    \\
    &&
    & {}_{\mathllap{}}\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &&
    && b^3 \mathbb{R}
  }
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That the diagram exists and commutes at the level of the underlying graded algebras of the [[formal dual]] CE-algebras is immediate in terms of the defining generators: each generator is mapped to the generator of the same name, if present, in the codomain, or to zero otherwise, except for $g_7 \in CE(b^6 \mathbb{R})$ which is sent to $h_3 \wedge \mu_4  + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7$ and $g_7 \in CE(b^6 \mathbb{R}/b^2 \mathbb{R})$, which is sent to $h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7 $, as indicated.  

It remains to check that the middle horizontal map respects the CE-differentials: by prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d(h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7)
    &=
    (g_4 - \mu_4) \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \mu_4 \wedge \mu_4
    \\
    & = g_4 \wedge g_4
  \end{aligned}
$$

and by def. \ref{RationalSphereAlgebra} this says indeed that $g_7 \mapsto h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7$ respects the CE-differentials.

###### Remark

The form of the equivariant cocycle in prop. \ref{7CocycleOnM2BraneDescends} is that of the [[curvature]] of the [[geometry of physics -- WZW terms|WZW term]] of the [[sigma model]] describing the [[M5-brane]] as considered in ([BLNPST 97, (6),(8)](#BLNPST97)).

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In view of remark \ref{RationalSpheres}, prop. \ref{7CocycleOnM2BraneDescends} says that the CE-elements $\mu_4$ and $\mu_7$ of prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} define a cocycle with values in the rational 4-sphere. In the discussions in _[[geometry of physics -- WZW terms]]_ and _[[geometry of physics -- BPS charges]]_ we see that under [[Lie integration]] and globalization in [[higher Cartan geometry]], these elements encode the [[supergravity C-field]] and its [[electric-magnetic duality|magnetic dual]]. That these fields should take values in the 4-sphere was first suggested in ([Sati 13, section 2.5](Hisham+Sati#Sati13)).

###### Remark

Passing to [[(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves]], this yields, via [[(∞,1)-Kan extension]], a sequence of [[adjoint quadruples]] as follows:

    & &\hookrightarrow&
  }
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #TheProcessOfModalities}
###### Proposition

Passing to the [[adjoint triples]] of [[idempotent monads]] and [[idempotent comonads]] which this induces, then yields 

* on the left the [[shape modality]] $\int$, [[flat modality]] $\flat$ and [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$, 

* in the middle yields the [[reduction modality]] $\Re$, the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Im$ and the [[infinitesimal flat modality]] $\&$. 

* on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit $\rightsquigarrow$ is the [[bosonic modality]] and whose left piece $\rightrightarrows$ produces _super-even_ components, containing all the "[[fermion]] [[currents]]" if one wishes , which in this [[unity of opposites]] hence deserves to be called the _[[fermionic modality]]_. The further right adjoint $R$ is the [[rheonomy modality]].

Hence we get a process of [[adjoint modalities]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && id &\dashv& id 
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{fermionic}{}& \rightrightarrows &\dashv& \rightsquigarrow & \stackrel{bosonic}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{bosonic}{} & \rightsquigarrow &\dashv& Rh & \stackrel{rheonomic}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{reduced}{} & \Re &\dashv& \Im & \stackrel{infinitesimal}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{infinitesimal}{}& \Im &\dashv& \& & \stackrel{\text{&#233;tale}}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{contractible}{}& &#643; &\dashv& \flat & \stackrel{discrete}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{discrete}{}& \flat &\dashv& \sharp & \stackrel{differential}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }
$$

where "$\vee$" denotes inclusion of [[modal types]]. The first level is [[cohesion]], the second is [[differential cohesion]] ([[elasticity]]), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further "square roots" of all infinitesimal generators.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

All the sites are [[∞-cohesive sites]], which gives that we have an [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]]. The composite inclusion on the right is an [∞-cohesive neighbourhood site](differential+cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#PresentationOnInfinitesimalNeighbourhoodSites), whence the inclusion $Smooth\infty Gpd\hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth\infty Grpd$ exhibits [[differential cohesion]].

With this the rightmost adjoint quadruple gives the [[Aufhebung]] of $\Re \dashv \Im$ by $\rightsquigarrow \dashv \R$ and the further opposition $\rightrightarrows \dashv \rightsquigarrow$.

###### Remark

Any [[reflective subcategory]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}
  \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}

$$

induces an [[idempotent monad]] on $\mathbf{H}$, i.e. an [[endofunctor]]

$$
  \bigcirc \;\coloneqq\; i \circ L \;\colon\; \mathbf{H} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

equipped with a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \epsilon_X \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \bigcirc X
$$

such that applying $\bigcirc$ again to that transformation it becomes an [[isomorphism]].

Dually, any [[coreflective subcategory]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}
  \stackrel{\overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{R}{\longleftarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}
$$

induces an [[idempotent comonad]]

$$
  \Box \;\coloneqq\; i \circ R \;\colon\; \mathbf{H} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

If moreover these two cases combine to an [[adjoint triple]] of the form

$$
  \mathcal{C}
   \stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}
$$


or of the form

$$
  \mathcal{C}
   \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\longleftarrow}}

$$


then these (co-)monads themselves are [[adjunction|adjoint]] to each other as

$$
  \Box \dashv \bigcirc
$$

or as

$$
  \bigcirc \dashv \Box
  \,,
$$

respectively, forming an "[[adjoint cylinder]]".

Notice the following:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The total composite labeled $\Delta$ in prop. \ref{CoReflectonsOfToposes}
is indeed the [[locally constant sheaf]]-functor for $SuperFormalSmooth0Type$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $X$ be any object in image of this total functor, and let $U \times D_s \in CartSp \rtimes SupeInfPoint$. Then by adjunction $SuperFormalSmooth0Type(U\times D_s, X)$ is equivalently homs in $FormalSmooth0Type$ out of the dual of the Weil algebra which is the quotient of the original one by the ideal generated by its odd part. Hence this, in turn, is equivalently homs in $Smooth0Type$ out of $U$ and that finally is equivalently homs in $Set$ out of $\ast$ into the given set.

=--

+-- {: .num_cor #SystemOfModalities}
###### Corollary

Passing, via remark \ref{FromAdjunctionsToMonads}, from the sequence of [[adjoint quadruples]] in prop. \ref{CoReflectonsOfToposes}, yields the following system of [[adjoint triples]] of [[idempotent monads]] and [[idempotent comonads]]:


$$
  \array{
    && id &\dashv& id 
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{fermionic}{}& \rightrightarrows  &\dashv& \rightsquigarrow & \stackrel{bosonic}{}
    \\

    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }
$$

where $\vee$ denotes inclusion of [[modal types]].

=--

We pronounce the operations in corollary \ref{SystemOfModalities} as follows.

* [[solidity]]

  * **[[fermionic modality]] $\rightrightarrows$** -- the spaces it sends to the point are purely fermionic, the [[odd line]];

  * **[[bosonic modality]] $\rightsquigarrow$** -- sends a super-space to the underlying bosonic space;

  * **[[rheonomy modality]] $\Rh$**;

* [[elasticity]]

  * **[[reduction modality]] $\Re$** -- removes infinitesimal thickening;
 
  * **[[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Im$** -- sends a space to its [[de Rham space]];

  * **[[infinitesimal flat modality]] $\&$**;

* [[cohesion]]
  
  * **[[shape modality]]  $\int$** -- sends a space to its set $\pi_0$ of [[connected components]]; or rather, once we lift the discussion here from [[sheaves]] to [[infinity-stacks]], then this sends a space to its [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]];

  * **[[flat modality]] $\flat$** -- sends a space to the [[discrete space]] formed by its points;

  * **[[sharp modality]] $\sharp$**.



+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

* For $X \in SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth0Type \hookrightarrow FormalSmooth0Type \hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth0Type$  any ordinary [[smooth manifold]], this is a [[bosonic modality|bosonic]] [[modal type]] $\stackrel{\rightsquigarrow}{X} \simeq X$.

* The [[odd line]] $\mathbb{R}^{0|1}$ is purely [[fermionic modality|fermionic]] in that it is an $\e$-[[comodal type]]: $\stackrel{\rightrightarrows}{\mathbb{R}^{0|1}}\simeq \ast$.

* All [[super Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ have [[contractible]] [[shape]] in that $\int \mathbb{R}^{p|q} \simeq \ast$.

By applying [[universal constructions]] to the [[unit of a monad|units]]/[[counit of a comonad|counits]] of these [[modalities]], we obtain various further operations that will be useful

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinitesimalDiskBundle}
###### Definition

Given $X \in \mathbf{H}$, its _infinitesimal disk bundle_ $T_{inf} X\to X$

Given a point $x \;\colon\;  \ast \to X$, then the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] 
$\ast \to \mathbb{D}_x \to X$ of that point is the further [[pullback]] of the infinitesimal disk bundle to this point:
