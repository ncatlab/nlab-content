Let $Top$ be the category of topological spaces, and let $\Sigma$ be the full subcategory whose only two objects are a one-point space and $\mathbb{N}^+$, the one-point compactification of the discrete space of natural numbers. Let $J$ be the canonical Grothendieck topology on $\Sigma$. 

The **topological topos** is the topos of canonical sheaves $Sh_J(\Sigma)$ on $\Sigma$. The functor 

$$Top \to Set^{\Sigma^{op}}: X \mapsto Top(-, X)$$ 

is faithful and factors through $Sh_J(\Sigma)$, and its restriction to the category of [[sequential space]]s is full.
