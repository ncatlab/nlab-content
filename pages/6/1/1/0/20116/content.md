## Idea

An [[experiment]] studying [[neutrino]] [[physics]]:

The _Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna_ (ANITA) experiment has been designed to study ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos by detecting the radio pulses emitted by their interactions with the Antarctic ice sheet.

In 2018 the experiment saw some events that were interpreted as signaling New Physics beyond the [[standard model of particle physics]] ([Fox et. al.  18](#FoxEtAl18)).

Possible [[model (in theoretical physics)]] that have been suggested might explain this include [[sterile neutrinos]] ([Huang 18](#Huang18)) or [[leptoquarks]] ([Chauhan-Mohanty 18](#ChauhanMohanty18))
