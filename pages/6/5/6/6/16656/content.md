
In a [[monoid]], an element $x$ is __irreducible__ if it is neither [[invertible element|invertible]] nor the product of two non-invertible elements.  Without [[bias]], we can say that $x$ is irreducible if, whenever it is written as a product of a [[finite list]] of elements, at least one element in the list is invertible.
