## Definition

In a [[monoid]], an element $x$ is __irreducible__ if it is neither [[invertible element|invertible]] nor the product of two non-invertible elements.  Without [[bias]], we can say that $x$ is irreducible if, whenever it is written as a product of a [[finite list]] of elements, at least one element in the list is invertible.

In a [[commutative ring]], an element is **irreducible** if it is neither [[invertible element|invertible]] nor the product of two non-invertible elements, with respect to the multiplication operation on the commutative ring. 

## Examples

* Every [[prime number]] is an irreducible element in the integers. 

* Given a field $K$, every [[monic polynomial]] of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] one is an irreducible element in the univariate [[polynomial ring]] $K[x]$.
