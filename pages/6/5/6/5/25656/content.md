## Idea

Meshes are towers of constructible [[stratified space#stratified_bundle|stratified bundles]] that can be embedded in trivial directed line bundles. Meshes play a central role in the 'local' description of directed (namely, [[directed space#framed_spaces|framed]]) regular [[cell complex|cell]] and [dual-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_duality#Dual_cell_structures) complexes.

## Definition

Meshes are [[stratifications]] with additional [[structure]] (namely, structure that records spatial [[directed space|directions]] via framings). Recall, the [[fundamental category]] functor $\mathcal{E} : \mathcal{S}\mathit{trat} \to \mathbf{Cat}_\infty$ from the $\infty$-category of [[stratified space#conical_strat|(conical) stratifications]] to the $\infty$-category of [[âˆž-categories]]. For defining fundamental categories, we work with [[stratified space#exit_entrance_conv|entrance paths]] (which is the opposite convention to working with [[stratified space#exit_entrance_conv|exit paths]]). 

\begin{rmk} For simplicity, in the below one can replace $\infty$-category $\mathcal{E}$ with the fundamental *[[poset]]* $\mathsf{E}$, obtaining an equivalent definition of $n$-meshes (even though the definition of general $n$-mesh *bundles* will differ).
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn} A _1-mesh_ is a is a [[framing|framed]] [[contractible]] $k$-[[manifold]] $M$, $k \leq 1$, together with a [[stratification]] $f$ on $M$ whose strata are open $l$-disks, $l \leq 1$.
\end{defn}

Contractibility implies that any 1-mesh framed embeds in standard framed $\mathbb{R}$: we call such embeddings _mesh-trivialization_.

\begin{defn} A _1-mesh bundle_ $p : (M,f) \to B$ is a [[stratified space#stratified_bundle|stratified bundle]] bundle with 1-mesh fibers $(M_x, f_x)$, for $x \in B$, and a fiberwise mesh-triviailizing bundle embedding $p \hookrightarrow (\pi_B : B \times \mathbb{R} \to B)$ into the trivial $\mathbb{R}$-bundle over $B$, such that

1. $\mathcal{E}(p)$ is an [[exponentiable fibration]],
2. $\mathcal{E}(p_{(0)})$ is an [[opfibration]],
3. $\mathcal{E}(p_{(1)})$ is a [[fibration]],

where $p_{(i)}$ denotes the restriction of $p$ to the union of strata in its domain that are of dimension $i$ in all fibers they intersect.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} An _$n$-mesh bundle_ $M$ over a base stratification $(B,g)$ is a tower of 1-mesh bundles
$$
    (M_n, f_n) \to (M_{n-1}, f_{n-1}) \to ... \to (M_1, f_1) \to (M_0,f_0) = (B,g)
$$
If $(B,g) = \ast$ is the trivial stratification then we speak of an _$n$-mesh_ $M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk} There are several equivalent phrasings and further variations of the definitions of 1- and $n$-mesh bundles. For instance, the original assumption of contractibility in the definition of 1-meshes can be weakened.
\end{rmk}

\begin{terminology} An $n$-mesh $M$ is call _closed_ if $M_n$ is [[compact]], and _open_ if $M_n \cong \mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{terminology}

\begin{defn} An _$n$-mesh map_ $F : M \to N$ is a stratified map of towers that fiberwise preserves the framing. (In fact, this makes mesh maps framed maps in the sense of [[directed+topological+space#framed_spaces|framed directed spaces]].)
\end{defn}


## Properties

### Cell structures

Closed meshes are regular cell complexes. More generally, meshes $M$ are stratified $0$-types (meaning $\mathcal{E}(M_i,f_i)$ are $0$-[[truncated]] as $\infty$-categories).

### Classification

The fundamental categories $\mathcal{E}(M) = \mathcal{E}(f_n \to f_{n-1} \to ... \to f_0)$ of meshes are certain towers of poset maps 'with structure': this gives rise to a combinatorial notion dubbed [[trusses]]. In fact, meshes up to framed stratified homeomorphism are classified by trusses (see at [[trusses]] for more).

### Duality

As a consequence of the classification of meshes by trusses, we obtain a involutive dualization endofunctor on the category of meshes. This functor can be understood as a geometric dualiation operation. It maps open to closed meshes and vice versa.
