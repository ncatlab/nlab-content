Remark on terminology: [[Robert Langlands]] did not actually introduce or use the term "dual group". The original texts just speak of the "L-group" ([Gelbhart 84, page 29 (205)](#Gelbhart84)). Also, the role of ${}^L G$ in the number-theoretic [[Langlands program]] is not as symmetric as in the [[geometric Langlands program]], it essentially serves as an ingredient for the construction of [[automorphic L-functions]] from [[Galois representations]] in $G$. In the [comment to a message to Sarnak (2014)]() Langlands writes:

> This duality $[$ [[electric-magnetic duality]]/[[S-duality]] $]$ is quite different than the functoriality and reciprocity introduced in the arithmetic theory $[$ of the [[Langlands program]] $]$.

Further comments along these lines are in  ([Langlands 14, pages 6-7](#Langlands14)).
