## Idea ##

In strong shape theory, you remember all of the [[homotopy theory|homotopy]] coherence information in the approximations to a [[topological space]].


### Background ###
In classical [[shape theory]] or [[Čech homotopy]], the polyhedra or simplicial sets approximating a given space are treated as giving a [[pro-object]] in the homotopy category. In the early strong versions of shape theory the diagrams are thought of as being in the coherent homotopy pro category of simplical sets, or one of the equivalent forms (e.g. that due to Edwards and Hastings (1973)).  This is now probably better treated by the methods discussed in the entry on [[shape theory]].

### History ###

The earliest paper on strong shape would seem to be by D.E. Christie, in 1944. He looked at a 2-truncated version of the later theory.
