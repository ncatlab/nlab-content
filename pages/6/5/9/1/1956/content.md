##Motivation## 

$k$-linear [[derivation]]s of a (not necessarily commutative) associative unital $k$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] $A$ with values in $A$-[[bimodules]] are often considered: these are $k$-linear maps $d: A\to M$ satisfying the Leibniz identity: $d(a b)=d(a) b+ a d(b)$. One would like to construct a universal construction of that kind. 


##Definitions##

The triple $(A,M,d)$ is then called a __differential calculus__ over $A$, provided $M$ is in the $k$-linear span of all expressions of the form $a d(b_1) d(b_2)\cdots d(b_n)$ where $a,b_1,\ldots,b_n\in A$. Morphisms of differential calculi over $A$ are straightforward to define. A universal object in that category is the __universal differential calculus__ and $\Omega A = M$ in that case is called the __universal differential envelope__ of $A$. It is constructed as the quotient of the tensor algebra $T A$ modulo the ideal generated by the ("augmentation") kernel $I\subset A\otimes A$ of the multiplication map $A\otimes A\to k$; then $d a = 1\otimes a - a\otimes 1$.

This is a bit confusing. The subbimodule $I$ should rather be the degree-1 component of $\Omega A$ (see Bourbaki, Alg&#232;bre III, paragraph Probl&#232;me universel pour les d&#233;rivations: cas non commutatif).

[[Eric]]: I'm probably confused, but $A$ is degree-0 and $A\otimes A$ is degree-1.

The bimodule $\Omega A$ is in fact a $k$-algebra, generated by degree-$1$ elements (in $A$); differential $d:A\to \Omega A$ can be naturally extended along the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow \Omega A$ to a differential $d:\Omega A\to \Omega A$ satisfying the Leibniz rule, by setting $d 1 = 0$, $d (w y) =  d(w) y + (-1)^p w d(y)$, where $w,y$ are forms and $w\in\Omega^p A$ is homogeneous.
