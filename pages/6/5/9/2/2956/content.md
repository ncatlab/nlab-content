## Idea 

The _Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis_ states that for all $k = n+2$ a [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]] is "maximally monoidal".  In other words, for $k \geq n + 2$, a $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-category is the same thing as an $(n+2)$-tuply monoidal $n$-category.  More precisely, the natural inclusion $k Mon n Cat \hookrightarrow (n+2) Mon n Cat$ is an [[equivalence of higher categories]].


## Proof for $(n,1)$-categories

For the case of monoideal [[(n,r)-category|(n,1)-categories]] a proof of the stabilization hypothesis appears in 

section 43.5 of some version of

* [[Andr√© Joyal]], _The theory of quasicategories and its applications_ lectures at [Simplicial Methods in Higher Categories](http://www.crm.es/HigherCategories/), ([pdf](http://www.crm.cat/HigherCategories/hc2.pdf))

and later in
