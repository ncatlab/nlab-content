# Weak distributive laws

## Idea

The notion of a **weak distributive law** between two [[monads]] is a generalisation of that of a [[distributive law]], in which forming the [[composition|composite]] monad requires [[split idempotent|splitting]] an [[idempotent]] on the [[underlying]] [[composition|composite]] [[endofunctor]].
