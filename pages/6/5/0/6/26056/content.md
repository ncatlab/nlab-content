 {#NonProjectedSuperRiemannSurfaceModuli}

A [[supermanifold]] is called *projected* if it [[retraction|retracts]] onto its bosonic [[body]]. (That's not the wording used in the literature, though.)

Since the computation of [[superstring scattering amplitudes]] involves a [[Berezin integral]] over the [[supergeometry|super]] [[moduli space]] of the given type of super Riemann surfaces, it is of interested to know when this [[moduli space of super Riemann surfaces]] is projected, as that allows to separate the bosonic from the fermionic sectors of this "[[path integral]]".

However, it turns out that the super-[[moduli space of super Riemann surfaces]] $\mathfrak{M}_{g, n_S, n_R}$ is generically *not* projected beyond low [[genus of a surface|genus]] $g$ (the string's [[loop order]]), depending on 

* the number $n_S$ of Neveu-punctures 

* the number $n_R$ of Ramond-punctures.

Specifically:

* $\mathfrak{M}_{g, 0, 0}$ is not projected for $g \geq 5$, 

  $\mathfrak{M}_{g, n_S \geq 1, 0}$ is not projected for $g \geq n_S + 1$

  &lbrack;[Donagi & Witten 2015](#DonagiWitten15)&rbrack;

* $\mathfrak{M}_{g, 0, 2r \geq 2}$ is not projected for $g \geq 5r + 1$

  &lbrack;[Donagi & Ott 2023](#DonagiOtt23)&rbrack;.


On the other hand, $g = 2$ (stringy [[2-loop]]) remains the highest order for which integration over the moduli space has actually been considered/performed, see [D'Hoker & Phong 2002](string+scattering+amplitude#DHokerPhong02).
