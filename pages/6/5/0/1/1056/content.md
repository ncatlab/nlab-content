## Idea

By regarding a [[simplicial set]] as an [[object]] in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]], one effectively identifies it (up to weak equivalence) with that [[∞-groupoid]] that it presents under [[Kan fibrant replacement]].

If the original simplicial set is the [[nerve]] of a [[category]], the corresponding Kan fibrant replacement is something like the _$\infty$-groupoidification_ of that category: see [[geometric realization of categories]].

This way each ordinary category models an [[∞-groupoid]]. The _Thomason_ [[model category]] structure on [[Cat]] exhibits this: in this [[model category]] a morphism between two categories is a weak equivalence, precisely if it induces a weak equivalence of the corresponding $\infty$-groupoids.  

It turns out the Thomason model structure on [[Cat]] is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

This is remarkable, in that it says that every [[homotopy n-type|homotopy type]], i. e. every weak equivalence class of $\infty$-groupoids, is obtained by $\infty$-groupoidifying just categories.

In fact, every cofibrant object in this structure is a [[poset]]. Since every object in a model category is weakly equivalent to a cofibrant one, this means that even the [[nerve]]s of just posets are sufficient to model all homotopy types.


This is a rather curious aspect of the [[Robert Thomason|Thomason]] model on [[Cat]]: it does not really have anything intrinsically to do with [[category|categories]], but rather uses these as a way to present [[∞-groupoid]]s. In particular, the class of weak equivalences is much larger than just the [[equivalence of categories|equivalences of categories]]. 
There is a _different_ model structure on [[Cat]] in which the weak equivalences are precisely the "true" weak [[equivalence of categories|equivalences of categories]] (not of anything constructed from them). This is called the [[canonical model structure on Cat]].

## Definition

Recall the [[subdivision]] functor $Sd$ and its right adjoint $Ex$.
The Thomason model structure on $Cat$ is given by

* A functor is a Thomason cofibration iff it has the left lifting property
against the Thomason trivial fibrations
* A functor $f : C \to D$ is a Thomason weak equivalence iff $N(f)$ is a weak homotopy equivalence
* A functor $f : C \to D$ is a Thomason fibration iff $Ex^2 N(f)$ is a Kan fibration

## Properties

### Equivalence with the classical model structure on simplicial sets

The Thomason model structure on Cat is [[Quillen equivalent]] to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] by the adjunction

$$ h Sd^2 : sSet \rightleftarrows Cat : Ex^2 N $$

We can assert more: this is also an adjoint weak equivalence. These are relative functors between the [[relative categories]] $(sSet, Kan)$ and $(Cat, Thomason)$, and both the adjunction unit and counit are natural weak equivalences.

### The nerve is a homotopy colimit

By [Hirschhorn proposition 18.1.6](#Hir), the nerve of any category is the homotopy colimit of the constant point-valued diagram:

###### Proposition 
For any category $C$, $N(C) \simeq hocolim_{c \in C} \Delta^0$

In fact, when Hirschhorn's definition of the homotopy colimit for functors valued in simplicial model categories:
$$
  hocolim(f) = N(- \downarrow C)^{op} \otimes_{C} f
$$
we get an isomorphism $N(C)^{op} \cong hocolim(1)$.
