### Chord diagrams as multi-trace observables in the BMN matrix model
 {#AsLieWeightSystemsInBMNModel}

The [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[states]] of the [[BMN matrix model]] are temporally constant complex matrices which are [[complex number|complex]] [[metric Lie representations]] $\mathfrak{g} \otimes V \overset{\rho}{\to} V$ of $\mathfrak{g}=$[[su(2)]] (interpreted as [[fuzzy 2-sphere]] [[noncommutative geometries]] of [[giant gravitons]] or equivalently as [[fuzzy funnels]] of [[D0-D2 brane bound states]]).

A [[fuzzy 2-sphere]]-[[rotation]] [[invariant]] [[multi-trace observable]] on these supersymmetric states is hence an expression of the following form:

Here we are showing the corresponding [[string diagram]]/[[Penrose notation]] for [[metric Lie representations]], which makes manifest that 

1. these multi-trace observables are encoded by [[Sullivan chord diagrams]] $D$ 

1. their value on the supersymmetric states $\mathfrak{su}(2) \otimes V \overset{\rho}{\to}V$ is the [[evaluation]] of the corresponding [[Lie algebra weight system]] $w_{{}_V}$ on $D$.

Or equivalently, if $\widehat D$ is a [[horizontal chord diagram]] whose $\sigma$-[[permutation|permuted]] closure is $D$ (see [here](horizontal+chord+diagram#ClosureToSullivanChordDiagrams)) then the values of the invariant multi-trace observables on the supersymmetric states of the BMN matrix model are the evaluation of $w_{V,\sigma}$ on $\widehat D$, as shown here:

But since [[all horizontal weight systems are partitioned Lie algebra weight systems]] this way, this identifies supersymmetric states of the BMN matrix model as seen by invariant multi-trace observables as [[horizontal chord diagrams]] evaluated in [[Lie algebra weight systems]].
