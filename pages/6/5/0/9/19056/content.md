Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $(\infty,1)$-category. An object $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be **$h$-initial** if it defines an [[initial object]] in the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(\mathcal{C})$.

Dually, an object is called **$h$-terminal** if it defines a terminal object in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$.
