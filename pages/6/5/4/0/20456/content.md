## Idea

A type of [[cohomology]] attached to prisms, which are $\delta$-rings equipped with an ideal satisfying some conditions. (The pair $(A, I)$ is a prism when $I$ is an [[ideal]] of a $\delta$-ring $A$ defining a [[Cartier divisor]] on its [[spectrum of a commutative ring|spectrum]] $Spec(A)$ such that $A$ is derived $(p,I)$-complete, and $p \in I + \phi(I)A$.)

Roughly, it is a unified construction of various $p$-adic cohomology theories, including [[Ã©tale cohomology]], [[de Rham cohomology]] and [[crystalline cohomology]], as well as the so far conjectural $q$-de Rham cohomology of [[Peter Scholze]].

## Definition

Let $(A,I)$ be a prism as defined above. Let $R$ be a formally smooth $A/I$-algebra. The _prismatic site_ $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ has objects which are prisms $(B,IB)$ over $(A,I)$ together with a map $R\to B/IB$ over $A/I$. Such an object is written $(R\to B/IB\leftarrow B)$.

We have functors $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ and $\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{\Delta}$ which sends $(R\to B/IB\leftarrow B)$ to $B$ and $B/IB$ respectively.

The _prismatic cohomology_ of $R$ is defined to be $\Delta_{R/A}:=R\Gamma((R/A)_{\Delta},\mathcal{O}_{\Delta})$.

## Comparison theorems

We have the following comparison theorems:
\begin{theorem}[crystalline comparison]
$\phi_{A}^{*}\Delta_{R/A}^{\wedge}=R\Gamma_{crys}(R/A)$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[etale comparison]
$R\Gamma_{\et}(\mathrm{Spec}(R[1/p]),\mathbb{Z}/p^{n})=(\Delta_{R/A}[1/d]/p^{n})^{\phi=1}$
\end{theorem}
