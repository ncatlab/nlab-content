## Idea

Prismatic cohomology is a cohomology theory for p-adic [[formal schemes]] which can specialize into various $p$-adic cohomology theories, including [[étale cohomology]], [[de Rham cohomology]] and [[crystalline cohomology]], as well as the so far conjectural $q$-de Rham cohomology of [[Peter Scholze]]. It is a geometric approach to integral [[p-adic Hodge theory]].

## Prisms

A prism is a pair $(A,I)$ where $A$ is a $\delta$-ring and $I$ is an ideal defining a Cartier divisor on $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, such that $A$ is derived $(p,I)$-complete, and $p \in I + \phi(I)A$.

## Examples of Prisms

* $A=\mathbb{Z}_{p}[[u]]$ and $I=(u-p)$
* $A=A_{\mathrm{inf}}(R)$ and $I=\mathrm{ker}(\theta)$, where $\theta:A_{\mathrm{inf}}(R)\to R$ is the canonical surjection

## Relation to Perfectoid Rings

A prism $(A,I)$ is _perfect_ if $A$ is perfect. The category of perfect prisms is equivalent to the category of _integral perfectoid rings_ which are related to, but not the same as, the perfectoid rings in [[perfectoid spaces]]. The definition of integral perfectoid ring can be found in Definition 3.5 of  [BhattScholze19](#BhattScholze19) and the relation between the two notions of perfectoid can be found in Lemma 3.20 of the same paper.

## Definition of Prismatic Cohomology

Let $(A,I)$ be a prism as defined above. Let $R$ be a formally smooth $A/I$-algebra. The _prismatic site_ $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ has objects which are prisms $(B,I B)$ over $(A,I)$ together with a map $R\to B/I B$ over $A/I$. Such an object is written $(R\to B/I B\leftarrow B)$.

We have functors $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ and $\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{\Delta}$ which sends $(R\to B/I B\leftarrow B)$ to $B$ and $B/I B$ respectively. The _prismatic cohomology_ of $R$ is defined to be $\Delta_{R/A}:=R\Gamma((R/A)_{\Delta},\mathcal{O}_{\Delta})$.

## Comparison theorems

We have the following comparison theorems relating prismatic cohomology to the crystalline and étale cohomology:

\begin{theorem}
Let $A,(p)$ be a bounded prism and let $R$ be a smooth $A/p$-algebra. There exists a canonical isomorphism
$$\phi_{A}^{*}\Delta_{R/A}^{\wedge}\cong R\Gamma_{crys}(R/A)$$
in $D(A)$, compatible with the action of Frobenius on both sides.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Let $(A,I)$ be a perfect prism and let $R$ be a $p$-complete $A/I$-algebra. For all $n\geq 1$, there exists a canonical isomorphism
$$R\Gamma_{\et}(\mathrm{Spec}(R[1/p]),\mathbb{Z}/p^{n})\cong (\Delta_{R/A}[1/d]/p^{n})^{\phi=1}$$
where $d$ is a generator of $I$.
\end{theorem}

## Absolute Prismatic Cohomology

By forgetting the choice of base prism, one obtains the absolute prismatic cohomology. Given a p-adic formal scheme $X$, its absolute prismatic site ${X}_{\Delta}$ is the category of all bounded  prisms $(B,J)$ equipped with a map $\mathrm{Spf}(B/J)\to X$, topologized with the flat topology. We have sheaves $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$, $I_{\Delta}$, and $\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{\Delta}$ obtained by remembering $B$, $J$, and $B/J$ respectively.

The absolute prismatic cohomology $R\Gamma(X_{\Delta},\mathcal{O}_{\Delta})$ is equipped with a filtration called the _Nygaard filtration_, playing a role analogous to that of the [[Hodge filtration]] for [[de Rham cohomology]].

## Prismatic Crystals

Let $X$ be a p-adic formal scheme and let $X_{\Delta}$ be its absolute prismatic site as above. A _prismatic crystal_ is an assignment

$$(B,J)\in X_{\Delta}\mapsto \mathcal{E}(B)\in\mathrm{Vect}_{B}$$

where $\mathrm{Vect}_{B}$ is the set of finite projective $B$-modules.

A stacky approach to the study of prismatic crystals has been developed independently by Drinfeld ([Drinfeld20](#Drinfeld20)) and Bhatt-Lurie ([BhattLurie22](#BhattLurie22)).

Given p-adic formal scheme $X$, one can attach a stack, called the _Cartier-Witt stack_ and denoted $\mathrm{WCart}_{X}$ by Bhatt-Lurie, and called the _[[prismatization]]_ of $X$ and denoted $X^{\Delta}$ by Drinfeld. When $X$ is quasi-syntomic, one can identify the $\infty$-category of crystals of $(p,I_{\Delta})$-complete complexes on $(X_{\Delta},\mathcal{O}_{\Delta})$ with the derived $\infty$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves on $\mathrm{WCart}_{X}$ ([Bhatt21](#Bhatt21), Remark 2.6).

## Applications

Prismatic cohomology can be used to obtain the following inequality for $X$ a proper smooth [[formal scheme]] over $\mathbb{C}_{p}$ (here $k$ is the residue field of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}_{p}}$):

$$dim_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}H_{et}^{i}(X_{\mathbb{C}_{p}},\mathbb{F}_{p})\leq dim_{k}H_{dR}^{i}(X_{k})$$

Prismatic cohomology has also been used in [Bhatt20](#Bhatt20) to prove that modulo a prime power the absolute integral closure of an excellent Noetherian domain is Cohen-Macaulay. The proof also uses a p-adic version of the [[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence]] being developed in yet-unpublished work of [[Bhargav Bhatt]] and [[Jacob Lurie]].

Prismatic cohomology has also been used to construct a version of [[syntomic cohomology]], which describes the graded pieces of a "motivic" filtration on p-adic etale K-theory. This is analogous to the filtration on [[topological K-theory]] whose graded pieces are described by the shifted singular cohomology complex, and is also analogous to the filtration on [[algebraic K-theory]] by [[motivic cohomology]]. This is used by Antieau, Krause and Nikolaus in [AKN22](#AKN22) to determine the K-groups of $\mathbb{Z}/p^{n}$.

## Historical Precursors

Prismatic cohomology was developed by [[Bhargav Bhatt]] and [[Peter Scholze]] following earlier work on developing an integral version of [[p-adic Hodge theory]]. Some of this earlier work includes $A_inf$-cohomology in [BhattMorrowScholze16](#BhattMorrowScholze16) and integral p-adic Hodge theory via [[topological Hochschild homology]] in [BhattMorrowScholze16](#BhattMorrowScholze16), both of which were developed together with [[Matthew Morrow]].
