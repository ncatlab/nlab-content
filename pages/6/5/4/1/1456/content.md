A __monoid object__ in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal]] to $C$.

By the [[microcosm principle]], in order to define monoid objects in $C$, $C$ itself must be a "categorified monoid" in some way.  The natural requirement is that it be a [[monoidal category]].  In fact, it suffices if it is a [[multicategory]].    

Compare to a [[group object]], which in contrast can only be defined using finite [[product]]s, rather than an arbitrary monoidal structure on the category $C$.
