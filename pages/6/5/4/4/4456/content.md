## Definition

A **preframe** is a [[poset]] with finite [[meets]] and [[directed set|directed]] [[joins]], and in which the finite meets distribute over the directed joins.

## Remarks

A preframe is a [[frame]] if and only if it is also a [[distributive lattice]], i.e. it has finite joins which are distributed over by finite meets.

Preframes are a useful technical tool in the study of [[proper map]]s of [[locales]].

Since preframes involve operations of arbitrarily large arity, it is not automatic that they are [[monadic|monadic functor]] over Set or that they can be presented by generators and relations.  It is, however, true; see
