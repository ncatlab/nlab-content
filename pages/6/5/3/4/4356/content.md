## Idea

_Differential cobordism cohomology_ is the refinement to [[differential cohomology]] of [[cobordism cohomology theory]].

By tensoring with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact ring]], this induces various other differential cohomology theories, such as [[differential elliptic cohomology]].

## References

A model for a multiplicative differential refinement of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]], the theory represented by the [[Thom spectrum]] is in
