One wants to regard a [[weak complicial set]] as the [[nerve]] of a weak [[omega-category]], even if not in all cases there may be an definition of weak [[omega-category]] apart from that [[weak complicial set]]. In that context Dominic Verity therefore speaks of **simplicial weak $\omega$-category theory**.
