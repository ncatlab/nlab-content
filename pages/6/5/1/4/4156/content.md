## Idea ##
This page is about PCT theorems in [[quantum field theory]]. PCT stands for parity, charge and time. The laws of nature as described by [[quantum field theory]]s are believed to be invariant if one simultaneously reverses the arrow of time, conjugates all charges and reverses all chiral properties. PCT theorems try to make this believe precise by defining the appropriate operators and showing that certain expressions remain constant. Both the statements and the proofs depend on the framework for [[quantum field theory]] one uses.

Being "invariant" means that every process that can be observerd in our universe can be observed identically in the "mirror" universe, that is there is no experiment in our universe that cannot be duplicated in the mirror universe. 

For some time physicists believed that subsets of the PCT symmetry are respected by nature, but today there are counterexamples known for every subset, for example:

* The [[weak force]] violates parity symmetry.

* Charge symmetry would violate the observation that the universe consists mostly of matter and not of matter and antimatter.

* For CP symmetry violation see Wikipedia: [CP violation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation)

* All known physical laws are time symmetric, but since PCT symmetry is believed to hold and CP symmetry does not hold, there has to be a process that breaks T symmetry. As of today there is no consenus about what that process may be (there are good reasons to believe that it has nothing to do with the second law of thermodynamics).

### Definition in the Haag-Kastler approach ###
Let $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{J})$ be a Haag-Kastler net on [[Minkowski spacetime]].

The PCT operator $\Theta$ is an anti-linear automorphism, that is for every local algebra $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O})$, elements $A, B \in \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O})$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ we have the relations
$$
\Theta(AB) = \Theta(A) \Theta(B) \; \; \text{and} \; \; \Theta(\lambda A) = \overline \lambda \Theta(A)
$$

$$
\Theta(\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O})) = \mathcal{M}(-\mathcal{O})
$$

For the representation $U(\Lambda, a)$ of the [[Poincare group]] on $\mathcal{M}$ we have
$$
\Theta U(\Lambda, a) A = U(\Lambda, -a) \Theta A 
$$

Further, $\Theta$ has to transform every [[charged sector]] into its conjugate sector.
A PCT theorem in this approach is a theorem that states suffcient conditions such that an PCT operator $\Theta$ exists.
