A [[category]] is _skeletal_ if objects that are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] are necessarily [[equality|equal]]. 

A **skeleton** of a category is any skeletal [[subcategory]] that is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the original category. 

If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then every category has a skeleton. Notice that the [[axiom of choice]] fails in general when one considers [[internal category|internal categories]]. Hence not every [[internal category]] has a skeleton.
