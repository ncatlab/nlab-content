Barr proved an embedding theorem for [[regular categories]] and a strengthening for the [[Barr exact categories]].

Barr's embedding theorem for [[regular categories]] says that every small regular category can be embedded into a category of small presheaves. It has been proved

and, in a different way, in 

* M. Barr, _Representation of categories_, J. Pure Appl. Alg. __41__ (1986) 113-137 (this article has supposedly some fixable errors).

[[Michael Barr]]'s full exact embedding theorem for [[Barr exact categories]], proved in (?)

generalizes the Lubkin-Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorems for abelian categories. The Giraud's theorem for topoi is not much more than a special case of that theorem.

One can also consider categories enriched over a locally finitely presentable closed symmetric monoidal category $V$. Such a $V$-category $C$ is regular if it is finitely complete, admits the coequalizers of kernel pairs all [[regular epimorphism]]s are universal (i.e. stable under pullbacks) and stable under cotensors with the finite objects. A $V$-functor is regular if it preserves finite limits and regular epimorphisms. The following generalizes the Barr's embedding theorem for regular categories to the regular enriched categories:

Its main results is 

> Theorem 10. For a small regular $V$-category $C$ there exists a small category $T$ and a regular fully faithful functor $E : C \longrightarrow [T, V]$.
