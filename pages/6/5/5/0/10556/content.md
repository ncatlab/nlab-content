__&#216;ystein Ore__ was a Norwegian algebraist and graph theorist. His Norwegian name in his mathematical articles was however spelled as Oystein Ore. He introduced [[Ore extension]]s and Ore conditions for [[Ore set]]s (in the context of study of linear equations over noncommutative [[Ore domain]]s) of rings. Ore introduced name groupoid for what we now call [[magma]] (cf. [[historical notes on quasigroups]]).
