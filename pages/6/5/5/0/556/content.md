A **2-categorical limit** is the type of [[limit]] that is appropriate in a [[2-category]].

* See [[2-limit]] for the "morally correct" notion of "up-to-isomorphism" limit.

* See [[strict 2-limit]] for a stricter sort of limit that can exist in a [[strict 2-category]] and is sometimes useful in constructing weaker 2-limits.
