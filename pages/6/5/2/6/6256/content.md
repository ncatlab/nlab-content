## Idea

There are several theorems of [[Ernest Michael]] from the 1950s about [[paracompactness]]. There is also Michael's 1972 characterization of paracompact [[locally compact spaces]] under certain class of quotient maps.  

## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop #RegularSpacesWherOpenCoveringIsRefinedbyCountableLocallyFiniteConnectionsofOpensAreParacompact}
###### Proposition
**(detection of paracompactness, [Michael 53, theorem 1](#Michael53))**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] such that

1. $X$ is [[regular topological space|regular]];

1. every [[open cover]] of $X$ has a [[refinement]] by a union of a [[countable set]] of 

   [[locally finite sets of subsets|locally finite]] sets of open subsets (not necessarily covering). 

Then $X$ is [[paracompact topological space]].

This implies in particular that [[second-countable regular spaces are paracompact]].


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
**(on the closed image of a paracompact space, [Michael 57, corollary 1](#Michael57))**

The [[image]] of a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] under a [[closed maps|closed]] [[continuous function]] is also paracompact Hausdorff.

###### Proposition
**(Michael selection theorem)** 

A [[lower semicontinuous map]] from a [[paracompact topological space]] $X$ to a [[Banach space]] $E$ with convex closed values has a continuous subrelation which is a function. If this is true for a given topological space $Y$ instead of $E$ and all such functions and codomains $E$, then $Y$ is paracompact.
