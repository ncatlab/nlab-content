## Idea

Every (paracompact Hausdorff) [[differentiable manifold]] can be equipped with a [[Riemannian structure]]. Therefore the existence of a metric does not impose constraints on a topology of a manifold. The local Riemannian structure of a Riemannian manifold on the other hand can be very different with the same global topology: there are even locally many nonisometric Riemannian structures on the same manifold/neighborhood. All even dimensional manifolds allow *locally* a (unique up to isomorphism) [[symplectic structure]]. [[symplectic manifold|Symplectic manifolds]], due to the [[Darboux theorem]], are all locally isomorphic, but according to the spectacular findings of [Gromov 1985](#Gromov1985), there are still global invariants of symplectic structure as well as topological constraints on even-dimensional manifolds permitting symplectic structure.
