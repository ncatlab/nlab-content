## Idea

The **hyperdescent** condition is used to refer to a specific [[∞-descent]] condition for [[∞-presheaves]].

Concretely, hyperdescent can be implemented by performing the [[left Bousfield localization]] of the [[model category]] of [[simplicial presheaves]] equipped with the [[projective model structure]] (say) at [[hypercovers]].
Equivalently, we can localize at those morphisms of [[simplicial presheaves]] that induce isomorphisms on all sheaves of homotopy groups.
Then [[fibrant objects]] in the resulting [[model structure]] will be precisely [[presheaves]] of [[Kan complexes]] that satisfy the hyperdescent condition.

Model structures on [[simplicial sheaves]] implementing hyperdescent were first constructed by [[André Joyal]] in mid-1980s.  [[John F. Jardine]] then constructed analogous model structures for [[simplicial presheaves]].

Hyperdescent should be contrasted with [[Čech descent]].
The [[Čech descent]] condition is weaker than the hyperdescent condition, since it uses [[Čech nerves]] of [[covering families]] instead of arbitrary [[hypercovers]].
However, for [[hypercomplete sites]] such as [[Zariski site]], [[Nisnevich site]], [[CartSp]], [[Stein site]], and most of the other sites used in differential and complex geometry, the [[hyperdescent]] condition coincides with the Čech descent condition.
