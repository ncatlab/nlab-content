An _endomorphism_ is a [[morphism]] in a [[category]] whose [[source]] and  [[target]] coincide.

The collection of all endomorphisms of an object $a$ of $C$

$$
  End_C(a) := \{ a \stackrel{f}{\to} a | f \in C_1 \}
$$

naturally is a [[monoid]]. In fact, the one-object category $\mathbf{B} End_C(a)$ defined by this monoid is the [[full]] [[subcategory]] of $C$ on $a$

$$
  \mathbf{B} End_C(a) \hookrightarrow C
  \,.
$$
