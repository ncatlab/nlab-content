## Idea

The _Nisnevich site_ is a certain [[Grothendieck topology]] on a [[category]] of [[scheme]]s. 

The [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[∞-stack]]s on $Nis$ (specifically: its [[homotopy localization|homotopy]] [[stabilization]]) is the $(\infty,1)$-topos whose [[cohomology]] theory is [[motivic cohomology]].

## Definition

The _Nisnevich site_ relative to a [[scheme]] $S$ is the [[site]] given by

* the [[category]] of [[smooth scheme]]s of finite type over $S$;

* equipped with the [[Grothendieck topology]] whose covering families 
  for an $S$-scheme $U$ are finite families of [[etale map]]s $V_i \to U$
  that form a cover in the [[etale site]] and such that 
  for all [[field]]s $k$ every morphism
  $Spec k \to U$ lifts to one of the $V_i$.
