## Ideas

Typical ambiguity means you don't have to explicitly say what universe level you're working at; you just say something like "Type" and the system (or the reader) guesses it. 

Both Russell and Tarski style universes can be typically ambiguous or not.

## Examples

* [[Coq]] uses Russell style universes with typical ambiguity. 

* [[Agda]] uses Russell style universes without typical ambiguity: you always have to explicitly indicate the universe level.

* The [[HoTT Book]] (first edition) uses Russell style universes with (except for a few places) typical ambiguity.
