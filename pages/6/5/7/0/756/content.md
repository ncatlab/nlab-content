**$\Simp\Ab$** is the category of simplicial abelian groups, i.e., of [[simplicial object]]s in the category [[Ab]] of [[abelian group]]s, i.e., it is the [[functor category]] of functors from the [[opposite category]] $\Delta^{op}$ of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ to $Ab$:

$$
  \Simp\Ab = [\Delta^{op}, Ab]
  \,.
