## Definition

Suppose $X$ is a set and $M$ is a [[σ-algebra]] of subsets of $X$.

A __σ-ideal__ of $M$ is a subset $N\subset M$ that is closed under countable unions and passage to subsets: if $a\in N$, $b\in M$, and $b\subset a$, then $b\in N$.

## Example

If $\mu$ is a [[measure]] on a [[measurable space]] $(X,M)$, then
$$N_\mu = \{m\in M\mid \mu(m)=0\}$$
is a σ-ideal.

## Applications

Sometimes we do not have a canonical measure $\mu$ at our disposal, but we do have a canonical σ-ideal of negligible sets.
This is the case, for example, for [[smooth manifolds]] and [[locally compact groups]].

Replacing the data of a [[measure]] $\mu$ with the data of a σ-ideal $N$ results in the concept of an [[enhanced measurable space]] $(X,M,N)$.
See the article [[categories of measure theory]] for more details and motivation.
