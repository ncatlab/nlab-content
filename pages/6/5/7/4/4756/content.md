## Idea

A **(2,1)-presheaf** is a [[presheaf]] with values in the [[(2,1)-category]] [[Grpd]]. A 2-[[truncated]] [[(∞,1)-presheaf]].

Sometimes this is also called a **prestack**. Other times a prestack is more specifically taken to be a [[separated (infinity,1)-presheaf|separated (2,1)-presheaf]]: a $(2,1)$-presheaf such that the functors into its [[descent]] objects are [[full and faithful functor]]s.

The [[∞-stackification]] of a $(2,1)$-presheaf is a certain [[2-sheaf]] or [[stack]].
