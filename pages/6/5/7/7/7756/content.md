## Idea

A __first-order theory__ is a [[theory]] written in the language of [[first-order logic]] i.e it is a set of formulas or sequents (or generally, [[axioms]] over a signature) whose [[quantification|quantifiers]] and variables range over individuals of the underlying domain, but not over subsets of individuals nor over functions or relations of individuals etc. A first-order theory is called _infinitary_ when the expressions contain infinite disjunctions or conjunctions, else it is called _finitary_.

Another name for a first-order theory is _elementary theory_ which is found in the older literature but by now has gone extinct though it has left its traces in names like [[elementary topos]], [[elementary embedding]], [[ETCC]] etc.

The characterization of set-theoretic [[models]] of (finitary) first-order theories is the topic of traditional [[model theory]].

## Examples

Formulations of [[set theory]] are usually first-order theories, such as

* [[material set theory]]: [[ZFC]]

* [[structural set theory]]: [[fully formal ETCS]]

## Remark

In particular, the precise formulation of the former in first-order predicate logic by [[Some remarks on axiomatized set theory|Skolem in 1922]] provided the impetus for the strong hold that  first-order predicate logic gained over mathematical logic in the following.

It is somewhat ironic that classical  first-order logic owes its promotion to prominence to intuitionistic mathematicians like [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]] (1910,1918) and [[Thoralf Skolem|Skolem]].
