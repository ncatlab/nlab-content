### Structure of the seminar ###
{#Structure}

Each time we have a topical talk given by local or external speakers on (higher) differential geometry and (derived) algebraic geometry, based on interests of the participants. The abstracts can be seen in this webpage at least one week prior to the talk. We shall also give a minor amount of prerequisites for each talk, so that undergraduates who are not familiar with those can have some preview ahead of time. By the end of each talk, there will be a conclusion section consists of discussions, Q&A, backgrounds survey to help people with diverse backgrounds to better capture the main ideas.

### Prerequisite ###
{#Prerequisite}
Basics of calculus and algebras.

#### Nov. 3rd, 2016: On jets, jet bundles and $l_\infty$ structures. ####

We start by looking at formal Taylor series of smooth functions at certain point of a smooth manifold $M$, and from this we define an infinite dimensional manifolds called jets space. We show that this space can be viewed as an infinite dimensional vector bundle over $M$, and describe the transition function. The infinite jet bundle $J_M$ has a filtration, and can be noncanonically identified with ${\rm Sym}^\bullet T^\vee M$. Moreover, there are algebraic structures on its sections $\Gamma(J_M)\equiv \mathcal {J}_M$.

**For Students:**

* A helpful practice: consider the case when $M = \mathbb {R}^n$, then one can view $J_M$ as an infinite dimensional vector space. 

* We assume one knows the basic definition of vector bundles, and as special example, tangent bundle and cotangent bundle.

####Nov. 10th, 2016: Geometric and topological information of jet bundles, Atiyah class.####
The jet bundle $J_M$ has a flat connection, which can be extended into the de Rham module $\Omega_M^*\otimes_{C^\infty_M} J_M$. This makes the latter into a differential graded commutative  algebra (CDGA). This gives an $l_\infty$ structure on $\Omega_M\otimes_{C^\infty_M} TM[-1]$. Similar construction can be taken for $J(E)$ and $J_M\otimes_{\mathbb {R}} E$, and we can encode the information of connections, curvature on $E$ in the corresponding $l_\infty$ structure. We define and identify the Atiyah classes in those two different constructions. 

**For students:**

* Start by familiarizing yourself with differential forms --- this helps you to understand de Rham module in the talk. Differential forms on $M$ with de Rham differential also gives an example of CDGA. It would be helpful if you also know about connections on vector bundles.

* We shall give/assign background talks about Kahler differential, $l_\infty$ algebra, etc. So please do not worry if you do not know about those.
