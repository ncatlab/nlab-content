## Idea

### General

A _quiver gauge theory_ is a [[gauge theory]] -- usually a [[super Yang-Mills theory]] -- whose [[field (physics)|field]] content is determined by a [[quiver]] in that to each node $x_i$ of the quiver is assigned a [[gauge group]] $U(n_i)$ and to each edge a [[fermion]] field species which is charged as the [[fundamental representation]] under the gauge group of the target and the anti-fundamental representation of the domain of the quiver edge.

Such data naturally arises in [[geometric engineering of quantum field theory]] from [[D-brane]] models in [[string theory]] with D-branes located at certain [[singularities]] of a [[Calabi-Yau variety]]: the nodes $x_i$ of the quiver for a $(d+1)$-dimensional quiver gauge theory correspond to $n_i$ coincident $d$-[[D-branes]] and the edges of the quiver to [[open string]] states stretching between these branes. Under this interpretation, a [[representation]] of the quiver corresponds to giving all these fields a [[vacuum expectation value]].


### As fixed point locus

Consider a $U(N)$ [[Chan-Paton gauge field]] theory on [[D-branes]] at a $G$-[[orbifold]] [[singularity]] $\mathbb{C}^n\sslash G$ for $\Gamma$ a [[finite group]].

Then the [[fermions]] transform in $\mathbf{c} \otimes (N \mathbf[r]) \otimes (N \mathbf{r}^\ast)$, where $\mathbf{r}$ denotes the [[regular representation]] of $\Gamma$ and $\mathbf{c}$ denotes the representation which defines the [[orbifold]] [[action]]. 

Then the $\Gamma$-[[fixed point space]] inside this representation is

$$
  \big(
    \mathbf{c} \otimes (N \mathbf{r}) \otimes (N \mathbf{r}^\ast)
  \big)^\Gamma
$$

is the corresponding weighted [[McKay quiver]] matrix.

This observation is due to [Lawrence-Nekrasov-Vafa 98, Section 2.1](#LawrenceNekrasovVafa98)




## Properties

### Relation between coherent sheaves and quiver representations

The [[representation theory|representation theoretic]] aspects of the [[gauge theory]] thus obtained depend only on aspects which are already seen by the [[B-model]] [[topological string]], which in this context plays the role of a simplified version of the physical [[superstring]] itself. By the discussion at _[[TCFT]]_ this [[topological field theory]] is essentially determined by its [[derived category]] of [[B-branes]], which is a [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on the given [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]]. Localized to suitable [[singularities]] the [[B-branes]] decompose into [[fractional branes]] which is mathematically reflected by the existence of [[exceptional collections]] of objects in the derived category. The [[endomorphism algebra]] of the [[direct sum]] of the objects in the exceptional collection turns out to be the [[path algebra]] of the corresponding [[quiver]] and under this identification the [[derived categories]] of [[coherent sheaves]] and of [[quiver representations]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] ([Bondal 90](#Bondal90)). This equivalence to quiver representations gives one of the ways of getting a concrete combinatorial handle on derived categories of [[B-branes]] and hence on properties of quiver gauge theory.

### Relation to Seiberg duality

Under [[geometric engineering of quantum field theory]] via [[D-branes]] situated at [[ADE-singularities]] in non-compact [[Calabi-Yau varieties]] as above, for instance [[Seiberg duality]] of the corresponding quiver gauge field theories may be understood in terms of [[equivalences of categories]] of derived quiver representations corresponding to [[mutations of exceptional collections]] etc. ([Robles-Llana & Rocek 04](#RoblesLlanaRocek04)).

an [[exceptional collection]] in the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on a suitable [[Calabi-Yau variety]] [[cone]] is used to induce a [[quiver]] and make the derived category be equivalent to that of its [[quiver representations]].
