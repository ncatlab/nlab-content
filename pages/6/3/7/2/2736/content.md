## Idea

[[Set]]...

* Objects are sets
* Morphisms are functions

***

## Limits

[[limits]]

#### Initial Object

The empty set $\emptyset$ is the [[initial object]] in Set.

Why?

#### Terminal Object

Any one element set is a [[terminal object]] in Set.

Why?

#### Binary Products

The [[product]] in set is the...

Why?

#### Arbitrary Small Products

arbitrary (but small) [[products]]

#### Equalizers

The [[equalizer]] of two [[parallel morphisms|parallel functions]] $f,g:X\to Y$ is the subset of $X$ on which both functions coincide, i.e.

$$
  Eq(f,g)
  = 
  \left\{
     s \in c | 
     f(s) = g(s)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Why?

#### Pullbacks

The [[pullback]] of two functions of sets is the set of pairs $(x,y)$ such that $f(x)=g(y)$.

Why?

#### Fibred Products

[[fibred products]]

## Colimits

[[colimits]]

#### Coterminal Object

[[coterminal object]]

#### Binary Coproducts

 binary [[coproducts]]

#### Arbitray Small Coproducts

arbitrary (but small) [[coproducts]]

#### Coequalizers
 
[[coequalisers]]

#### Pushouts

[[pushouts]]

#### Cofibred Products
