A [[duality]] between homotopy and cohomology, which one can see in the fact that cohomology groups are homotopy classes of maps into a space with a single nonzero homotopy group, while homotopy groups are homotopy classes of maps from a space with a single nonzero cohomology group. 

* $H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}) \cong [X, K(\mathbb{Z},n)]$
* $\pi_n(X) \cong [S^n, X]$

$K(\mathbb{Z},n)$ is the (Eilenberg-MacLane) space whose only interesting homotopy group is the $n$th one, which is $\mathbb{Z}$.

$S^n$ is the space whose only interesting cohomology group is the $n$th one, which is $\mathbb{Z}$.

Note though that this duality is not perfect -- [comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/09/mathematical_miniatures.html#c019103), [comment](http://eom.springer.de/E/e120020.htm).
