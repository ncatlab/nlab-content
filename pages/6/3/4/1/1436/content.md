Eckmann--Hilton duality is an abstract [[duality]] arising from arrow reversal in [[Top]]. It manifests itself in a duality between [[homotopy theory|homotopy]] and [[cohomology]].

One can see this in the fact that [[cohomology group]]s consist of [[homotopy]] classes of maps into a space with a single nontrivial [[homotopy group]], while homotopy groups consist of homotopy classes of maps from a space with a single nontrivial cohomology group:
* $H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}) \cong [X, K(\mathbb{Z},n)]$
* $\pi_n(X) \cong [S^n, X]$

Here, $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$ is an [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane space]] whose only interesting homotopy group is $\pi_n(K(\mathbb{Z},n)) = \mathbb{Z}$, while $S^n$ is a [[sphere]] whose only interesting cohomology group is the $H^n(S^n,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$.

Note though that this duality does not hold perfectly in [[Top]]. For example, a pullback of a cofibration by a fibration is a cofibration, but a pushforward of a fibration by a cofibration is not a fibration. Since the [[model category]] axioms are self-dual, the failure of Eckmann-Hilton duality for ordinary homotopy theory shows that there are interesting facts about ordinary homotopy theory which cannot be derived from these axioms.
