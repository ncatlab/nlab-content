Eckmann--Hilton duality is a [[duality]] between [[homotopy theory|homotopy]] and [[cohomology]].

One can see this in the fact that [[cohomology group]]s consist of [[homotopy]] classes of maps into a space with a single nontrivial [[homotopy group]], while homotopy groups consist of homotopy classes of maps from a space with a single nontrivial cohomology group:
* $H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}) \cong [X, K(\mathbb{Z},n)]$
* $\pi_n(X) \cong [S^n, X]$

Here, $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$ is an [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane space]] whose only interesting homotopy group is $\pi_n(K(\mathbb{Z},n)) = \mathbb{Z}$, while $S^n$ is a [[sphere]] whose only interesting cohomology group is the $H^n(S^n,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$.

Note though that this duality is not perfect -- [comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/09/mathematical_miniatures.html#c019103), [comment](http://eom.springer.de/E/e120020.htm).
