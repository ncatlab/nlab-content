A **super vector space** is an [[object]] in the [[category]] [[SVect]]: as an object it is just a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space]], but when tensoring them one uses the non-trivial [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]] on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebras.  In simple terms, this means that when switching two 'odd' vectors one introduces a minus sign:

$$ v \otimes w \mapsto (-1)^{deg(v) deg(w)} w \otimes v $$
