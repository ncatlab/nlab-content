I was until 2006 a professor of mathematics at the University of Wales Bangor (aka University of Bangor). The University closed down the Mathematics degree and I was retired! Since then I have been on various interesting visiting positions, whilst being Emeritus, retaining an office in the Computer Science section of the university and continuing to work at least as hard as before (I claim).

I am writing a series of notes on the theory and application of crossed gadgetry in algebra and topology, and some parts of these notes (approximately first 7 chapters) have been made available on the web at various times. I am currently trying to write a new chapter on 2-vector spaces and 2-vector bundles, with the emphasis on 'trying'.
