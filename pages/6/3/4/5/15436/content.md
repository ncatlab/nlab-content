## Idea

Generally, by a "ring of integers" one means a concept that generalizes the standard [[integers]] inside the [[field]] of [[rational numbers]] to more general base-[[fields]], such as [[number fields]] or [[local field|local]] [[non-archimedean fields]]. 

## Definition

### General definition

In any unital ring $R$ one can identify the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ with the subring
$\{ n 1_R | n\in\mathbb{Z}\}\subseteq R$ of all multiples $\pm 1_R, \pm (1_R+1_R), \pm(1_R+1_R+1_R),\ldots$ of the unit element $1_R$. 

The ring $R$ is then a left and right module over $\mathbb{Z}$ via the multiplication with
the corresponding multiple of unit, that is $n.m = (n 1_R)\cdot m$. 
An __integer__ in a commutative ring $R$ is any element
$r\in R$ which satisfies equation $P(r) = 0$ 
where $P$ is a nontrivial [[polynomial]] whose coefficients are multiplies of $1_R$ and the top degree coefficient is $1_R$ (in other words, a [[root]] of a monic polynomial in $R$ with the coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$). 
It can be checked that the set of integers
(also said to be integral elements) in $R$ is closed with respect to addition, multiplication and taking the negative of an element, hence a subring of $R$, which is moreover containing the usual integers $\mathbb{Z} 1_R$ as unique solutions for $x\in R$ of equations $1_r \cdot x - n 1_R = 0$.

Notation: the subring of integers in an [[algebraic number field]] $K$ (a [[finite number|finite]]-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[field extension]] of $\mathbb{Q}$), is often denoted $\mathcal{O}_K \hookrightarrow K$. In a [[local field|local]] [[non-archimedean field]] $F$, then its ring of integers is often denoted $\mathcal{O}_F$.

## Properties in a number field
 {#OfANumberField}

Alternatively, an element $\alpha \in K$ is an __[[algebraic integer]]__ if the subring $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \hookrightarrow K$ generated by $\alpha$ is of [[finite number|finite]] [[rank]] over $\mathbb{Z}$. This makes it plain that the [[algebraic integers]] themselves form a [[ring]]: if $\alpha, \beta \in \mathcal{O}_K$ are integral, then both $\alpha - \beta$ and $\alpha \beta$ are contained in the image of the induced map $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[\beta] \to K$, which is also of finite rank. 

## Properties in a local non-archimedean field
 {#OfANonArchimedeanField}

Given a [[local field|local]] [[non-archimedean field]] $F$, then its ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$ is the subring of elements of [[norm]] $\leq 1$. 

If $F$ is the [[formal completion]] of a [[number field]] $K$, then the ring of integers of $F$ is the formal completion of the ring of integers of $K$ in the [above](#OfANumberField) sense.

## Examples

* For $K = \mathbb{Q}$ the [[rational numbers]] then $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}} \simeq \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[commutative ring]] of ordinary [[integers]].


* For $p$ any [[prime]] and $\mathbb{Q}_p$ the [[formal completion]] of $\mathbb{Q}$ at $p$, hence the [[p-adic numbers]], then the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is $\mathbb{Z}_p$, the [[p-adic integers]].

* For $K$ the [[Gaussian numbers]] then $\mathcal{O}_K$ is the [[Gaussian integers]].

* The ring of integers of the field $\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ of [[Laurent series]] with [[coefficients]] in a [[finite field]] is the ring of [[formal power series]] $\mathbb{F}_q[ [t] ]$.

## Properties

### General

A ring of integers is a [[Dedekind domain]].
