## Idea

In [[type theory]] what is called the _UIP axiom_, the axiom of _uniqueness of identity proofs_ is an [[axiom]] that when added to [[intensional type theory]] turns it into a [[extensional type theory|propositionally extensional type theory]].

The axiom asserts that any two [[terms]] of the same [[identity type]] 
$Id_A(x,y)$ are themselves [[propositional equality|propositionally equal]] (in the corresponding higher identity type).

This is contrary to the [[univalence]] axiom, which makes sense only in the absence of UIP.

## Statement

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The _UIP axiom_ (for types in a [[type of types|universe]] "$Type$") posits that the type 

$$
\underset{A \colon Type}{\prod} 
\underset{x,y \colon A}{\prod}
\underset{p,q \colon Id_A(x,y)}{\prod}
Id_{Id_A(x,y)}(p,q)
$$

has a term. In other words, we add to our type theory the rule

$$
\frac{}{
  \vdash uip
  \colon
  \underset{A \colon Type}{\prod} 
  \underset{x,y \colon A}{\prod}
  \underset{p,q \colon Id_A(x,y)}{\prod}
  Id_{Id_A(x,y)}(p,q)}
$$

We can modify this by making the hypotheses of the axiom into premises of the rule, if we wish.  In particular, this can be used to give a version of the rule that applies to all types not necessarily belonging to some fixed universe, using the [[judgment]] "$A\;type$" for "$A$ is a type" (as distinguished from "$A:Type$" for "$A$ belongs to the universe type $Type$").

$$
\frac{\Gamma\vdash A\; type \quad \Gamma\vdash x : A \quad \Gamma \vdash y:A \quad \Gamma \vdash p : Id_A(x,y) \quad \Gamma \vdash q:Id_A(x,y)}{
  \Gamma\vdash uip : Id_{Id_A(x,y)}(p,q)}
$$
