## Idea

In [[model theory]], a _model_ of a [[theory]] in some context is a realization of the axioms of that theory in that context.

## Definition

...

### For Lawvere theories

For $Syn(T)$ the [[syntactic category]] of a [[Lawvere theory]], and for $C$ any category with finite [[limit]]s, a _model_ for $T$ in $C$ is a product-preservinf functor

$$
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.
$$

The **category of models** in this case is hence the [[full subcategory]] of the [[functor category]] $[Syn(T),C]$ on product-preserving functors.
