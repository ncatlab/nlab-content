A **Polish space** is a [[topological space]] that's 
homeomorphic to a separable [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Every [[second countable space|second countable]] [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is a Polish space.

Polish spaces provide a useful framework for doing measure theory.  We can take any Polish space and regard it as a [[measurable space]] with its $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets.  Then, there is a complete classification of Polish spaces up to measurable bijection: there is one for each countable cardinality, and one whose cardinality is that of the continuum, and no others.

Why are Polish spaces 'not very big'?  In other words, why are there none with cardinality exceeding the continuum?  It's because any Polish space has a countable dense subset -- it's separable -- and you can write any point as a limit of a sequence of points in this subset.  So, you only need a sequence of integers to specify any point in a Polish space.
