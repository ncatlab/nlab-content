Momentum is, according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], the 'amount of motion' in an object.  It is, at least approximately, proportional to the object\'s [[mass]] and to its [[velocity]], and thus measured in units of mass times velocity.

Classically, momentum is often *defined* as [[mass]] times [[velocity]].  However, this breaks down in some situations:

*  Relativistically, the velocity factor is more complicated (tending to $\infty$ as velocity tends to the [[speed of light]]).
*  In the presence of velocity-dependent forces (notably those produced by a [[magnetic field]]), there is an additional position-dependent term.
*  In nonlinear coordinates (such as for [[angular momentum]]), one not only needs to use a nonlinear velocity (such as [[angular velocity]]) but also replace mass with something more complicated (such as [[moment of inertia]]) which is often position-dependent.

The systematic treatments of Hamiltonian and Lagrangean mechanics correct for these and also allow momentum to be treated naturally in quantum physics.


In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], momentum is one of the basic coordinates on [[phase space]].  In [[Lagrangean mechanics]], momentum is derived, as the partial derivative of the [[Lagrangean]] with respect to [[position]] $q$, or as the coefficient on $\mathrm{d}q$ in the [[action functional|action form]].


In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[canonical quantization]] process formally replaces momentum by $-i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x},$ where $x$ is position.  (Equivalently, in [[momentum space]], canonical quantization replaces $x$ by $i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial p}.)$  In this situation, position and momentum [[fail to commute|canonical+commutation+relation]].
