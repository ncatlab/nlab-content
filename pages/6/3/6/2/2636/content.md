Momentum is classically defined as [[mass]] times [[velocity]].  

In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[canonical quantization]] process formally replaces momentum by $-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx},$ where $x$ is position.  (Equivalently, in [[momentum space]], canonical quantization replaces $x$ by $i \hbar \frac{d}{dp}.)$  In this situation, position and momentum [fail to commute](canonical+commutation+relation).
