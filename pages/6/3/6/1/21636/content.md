## Life

I am [autistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism) at the [high-functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-functioning_autism) part of the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum).

At free times I write poems, which are shared in a small blog [Insensata Rigidez](https://insensatez.blog.br). I also have some admiration for the beautiful things in nature. Specially, I like to collect flowers, leaves, stones, died insects, etc.
