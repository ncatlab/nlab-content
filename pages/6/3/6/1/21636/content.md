I am a PhD student at [Departament of Mathematics](http://www.mat.ufmg.br/posgrad/) of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil. 

Presently I am mainly interested in (higher) gauge theory, geometric regularity theory, in finding general theorems on emergence between field theories,  in applying categorification methods in algebra and differential geometry, in abstracting standard results and in the axiomatization problem of Astrophysics.

I am a co-founder of a research group on mathematical-physics and categorification, called Algebraic, Categorical and Geometric Methods in Physics (or just Math-Phys-Cat Group). For our website, see [here](https://math-phys.group/).
