# About

I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer working in abstraction processes applied to Mathematics, Physics, Philosophy and Computer Science.

Currently I'm in a Software Developer position at [Magalu Cloud](https://magalu.cloud), the first Brazilian public cloud provider.

I'm also an active Linux user and a [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) lover.


# Math-Phys-Cat

I was one of the founders and the developer of the [[Math-Phys-Cat Group]], a Brazilian research group.  


# Development

I'm involved in constructing a functional approach to Python that presents strong type safety. For instance, see:

- [typed](https://github.com/ximenesyuri/typed): the basis of the approach.
- [comp](https://github.com/ximenesyuri/comp): using the approach to construct a component system compatible with Jinja.

Documentations for the projects are available at [ximenesyuri.com/libs](https://ximenesyuri.com/libs)
