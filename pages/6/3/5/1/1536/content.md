# Idea #

In any context it is of interest to ask which kind of [[morphism]]s $p : C \to D$ arise as [[pullback]]s along a classifying morphism $S_p : D \to U$ to some universal object $U$ of some universal morphism $p_{univ} : \hat U \to U$.

The Grothendieck construction describes this in the context of [[Cat]]: a morphism $p : C \to D$ of [[category|categories]] -- i.e. a [[functor]] -- is called a [[fibered category]] or [[Grothendieck fibration]] if it is encoded in a [[pseudofunctor]] $S_p : D \to Cat$.

The reconstruction of $p$ from the pseudofunctor $S_p$ is the Grothendieck construction.

# Definition #

Let for the time being [[Grpd]] be the 1-category of [[groupoid]]s and [[functor]]s between them.

Recall from [[generalized universal bundle]] that the "universal [[Grpd]]-[[bundle]]" is $Grpd_* \to Grpd$, where $Grpd_*$ is the category of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[groupoid]]s.

Then for $F : C \to Grpd$ a [[functor]], the Grothendieck construction for $F$ is the [[pullback]] $\int F \to C$ of $Grpd_* \to Grpd$ along $F$:

$$
  \array{
    \int F &\to& Grpd_*
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C &\stackrel{F}{\to}& Grpd
  }
  \,.
$$

This means that the objects of $\int F$ are pairs $(c,a)$, where $c \in Obj(C)$ and $a \in Obj(F(c))$ and morphisms in $\int F$ are given by pairs $(c \stackrel{f}{\to} c', \alpha : F(f)(a) \to a')$. This is to be visualized as

$$
  \int F = 
  \left\{
  \array{
    && {*}
    \\
    & {}^a\swarrow &\Downarrow^{\alpha}& \searrow^{a'}
    \\
    F(c) && \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} F(c')
    \\
    \\
    c &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& c'
  }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$


## Generalizations ##

The analog of the Grothendieck construction one categorical dimension down is the [[category of elements]] of a [[presheaf]].-

The analog of the Grothendieck construction for [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] is described at [[Cartesian fibration]] and at [[universal fibration of (∞,1)-categories]].


## Warning on terminology ##

The term 'Grothendieck Construction' is applied in the literature to at least two very different constructions (and as [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] introduced so many new ideas and constructions to mathematics, perhaps there are others!). One concerns the construction of a [[fibered category]] from a [[pseudofunctor]] and will be treated in more detail in the entry on [[Grothendieck fibration]].  The other referes to constructing the [[Grothendieck group]] is  in the context of [[K-theory]] from isomorphism classes of vector bundles on a space by the introduction of formal inverses, 'virtual bundles'.  This constructs an Abelian group from the semi-group of isomorphism classes.
