##Warning##
The term 'Grothendieck Construction' is applied in the literature to at least two very different constructions (and as [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] introduced so many new ideas and constructions to mathematics, perhaps there are others!). One concerns the construction of a [[fibered category]] from a [[pseudofunctor]] and will be treated in more detail in the entry on [[Grothendieck fibration]].  The other is  the way of constructing K-theory from isomorphism classes of vector bundles on a space by the introduction of formal inverses, 'virtual bundles'.  This constructs an Abelian group from the semi-group of isomorphism classes.
