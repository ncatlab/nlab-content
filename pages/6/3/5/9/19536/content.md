## Idea

The [[category]] $dgcAlg$ whose [[objects]] are [[differential graded-commutative algebras]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[homomorphisms]] between these (i.e. [[algebra homomorphisms]] that respect the [[graded object|grading]] and the [[differential]]).


## Properties

### Model structure

* [[model structure on dgc-algebras]]

### Full subcategories

Important [[full subcategories]] include thos of 

* [[connective]] dgc-algebras $dgcAlg_{\geq 0}$ which are concentrated in non-positive degree;

* [[semifree dgc-algebras]], equivalently [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] of [[L-infinity algebras]]

* [[rational homotopy theory]]

* [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]]

* [[Lie integration]]
