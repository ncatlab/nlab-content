An algebraic theory is a concept in [[universal algebra]] that describes a specific type of algebraic gadget, such as [[group|groups]] or [[ring|rings]]. An individual group or ring is a _model_ of the appropriate theory. Roughly speaking, an algebraic theory consists of a specification of operations and laws that these operations must satisfy.

Traditionally, algebraic theories were described in terms of [[logic]]. But _finitary_ algebraic theories (that is, those involving only finitary operations) can be understood category-theoretically as [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]]. However, there are also infinitary algebraic theories (such as an algebra in which arbitrary sums are possible, one model of which is $[0,\infty]$).

_Essentially_ algebraic theories allow for partially-defined operations. Just as finitary algebraic theories can be understood as Lawvere theories, which live in the [[doctrine]] of [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal categories]], so essentially algebraic theories can be understood by a generalisation to [[finitely complete category|finitely complete categories]].
