## Idea

The [[phases of matter|phases]] of [[condensed matter physics|quantum materials]] with [[gapped Hamiltonian]] admit a 
"[[topology|topological]]" (really: [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretical]]) classification by [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]] [[topological K-theory]], whence one speaks of _[[topological phases of matter]]_, _[[topological states of matter]]_, _[[topological order]]_, _[[topological insulators]]_, and the like.

## Properties

### Holographic relation to K-theory classification of D-brane charge

Under [[AdS/CFT duality in solid state physics]] the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]] corresponds to the [[K-theory classification of D-brane charge]] ([Ryu-Takayanagi 10a](#RyuTakayanagi10a), [Ryu-Takayanagi 10v](#RyuTakayanagi10b))
