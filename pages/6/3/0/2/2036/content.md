A [[nonassociative algebra]] $A$ is __alternative__ if it satisfies the following weakening of the associativity condition for multiplication: for every two elements $x,y\in A$ one has $x(x y)=(x x)y$ and $(x y)y=x(y y)$. 

In particular, every [[associative algebra]] is alternative. The properly *non*associative algebra of [[octonion]]s is also alternative. The reason is that it is obtained by a [[double of algebra with involution|doubling procedure]] from the algebra of [[quaternion]]s which is associative; and the double of any associative $\mathbf{R}$-algebra with involution is alternative.
