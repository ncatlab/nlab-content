__Jiang-Hua Lu__ is a geometer at the University of Hong Kong. Her PhD is from University of California, Berkeley, advised by [[Alan Weinstein]]. Her main specialty is  [[Poisson geometry]]. 

She introduced the notion of an [[associative bialgebroid]] over a noncommutative base, and a rather nonsymmetric version of the notion of [[Hopf algebroid]], partly motivated by imagining Poisson groupoids appearing in their quasiclassical limit.
