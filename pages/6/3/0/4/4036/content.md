## Definition


+-- {: .num_defn #GoodOpenCover }
###### Definition

A [[cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is called a **good cover** -- or **good open cover** if it is

1. an [[open cover]];

1. such that all the $U_i$ and all their inhabited finite intersections are [[contractible topological spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


For $X$ a [[topological manifold]] one often requires that the inhabited finite intersections are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]]. Similarly, for $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] one often requires that the finite inhabited intersections are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]].

In the literature this is traditionally glossed over, but this is in fact a subtle point, see the discussion at [[open ball]] and see below at _[Existence on paracompact smooth manifolds](#ExistenceOnParacompactManifolds)_. 

=--

Due to this subtlety, it is instructive to make explicit the following definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentiablyGoodOpenCover}
###### Definition

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ a _differentiably good open cover_ ([FSS 2010, Def. 6.3.9](#FSS10)) is a good open cover one all whose finite non-empty intersections are in fact [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]], hence to a [[Cartesian space]].

### Existence on paracompact smooth manifolds
 {#ExistenceOnParacompactManifolds}


\begin{remark}
\label{LiteratureOnExistenceOfDifferentiablyGoodOpenCovers}
The existence result (Prop. \ref{ExistenceOfDifferentiablyGoodOpenCovers} below) of differentiably good open covers (Def. \ref{DifferentiablyGoodOpenCover}) on smooth manifolds seems to have been a [[folk theorem]], based in turn on the [[folk theorem]] that every [[geodesic convexity|geodesically convex]] [[open neighbourhood]] in a [[Riemannian manifold]] is *[[diffeomorphic]]* (as opposed to just [[homeomorphic]]) to an [[open ball]], hence to a [[Cartesian space]].

For instance, the latter fact is asserted without proof or reference inside the proof of Theorem 5.1 of [Bott & Tu 1982](#BottTu82).

Actual proofs that [[star-shaped subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]] are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to [[open balls]]/[[Cartesian spaces]] have then been made explicit in [Gonnord & Tosel 1998, p. 60](#GonnordTosel98) and  [Ferus 2007, Thm. 237](#Ferus07). 

(These proofs had remained obscure: In the textbooks [Conlon 2008](ball#Conlon08) and [Lee 2009](ball#Lee09) the statement is still referred to as lacking a citable proof: Conlon writes that a proof is "extremely difficult", while Lee writes that "references to a complete proof are hard to find", see also [this remark](ball#LiteratureOnStarShapedOpenDiffeoToOpenBall) at _[[open  ball]]_.)

That this argument completes the existence proof of differentiably good open covers has  made explicit in [FSS 2010, Prop. A.1](#FSS10). In [Guillemin & Haine 19 this is Thm. 5.3.2](GuilleminHaine19), where the crucial step is left as Exercise 5.3, also App. C. See also [Demailly 2012, Lem. IV 6.9](#Demailly12).

\begin{proposition}
\label{ExistenceOfDifferentiablyGoodOpenCovers}
**(existence of differentiably good open covers)**
\linebreak
Every [[paracompact manifold|paracompact]] [[smooth manifold]] admits a good open cover, def.&#160;\ref{GoodOpenCover}, in fact
a differentiable good open cover, def.&#160;\ref{DifferentiablyGoodOpenCover}
\end{proposition}

The following proof of Prop. \ref{ExistenceOfDifferentiablyGoodOpenCovers} follows that given in [FSS 2010, Prop. A.1](#FSS10):

\begin{proof}
By ([Greene](#Greene)) every paracompact smooth manifold admits a [[Riemannian metric]] with positive [[convexity radius]] $r_{\mathrm{conv}} \in \mathbb{R}$. Choose such a metric and choose an [[open cover]] consisting for each point $p\in X$ of the geodesically convex open subset $U_p := B_p(r_{conv})$ given by the geodesic $r_{conv}$-ball at $p$. Since the [[injectivity radius]] of any metric is at least $2r_{\mathrm{conv}}$ it follows from the minimality of the geodesics in a geodesically convex region that inside every finite nonempty intersection $U_{p_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{p_n}$ the [[geodesic flow]] around any point $u$ is of radius less than or equal the injectivity radius and is therefore a diffeomorphism onto its image. 

Moreover, the [[preimage]] of the intersection region under the geometric flow is a [[star-shaped]] region in the [[tangent space]] $T_u X$: because the intersection of geodesically convex regions is itself geodesically convex, so that for any $v \in T_u X$ with $\exp(v) \in U_{p_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{p_n}$ the whole geodesic segment $t \mapsto \exp(t v)$ for $t \in [0,1]$ is also in the region.

So we have that every finite non-empty intersection of the $U_p$ is diffeomorphic to a star-shaped region in a vector space. By the results cited at [[ball]] (e.g. theorem 237 of ([Ferus 2007](#Ferus07))) this star-shaped region is diffeomorphic to an $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{proof}

Here is another proof of Prop. \ref{ExistenceOfDifferentiablyGoodOpenCovers}:

\begin{proof}
Every [[paracompact manifold|paracompact]] [[smooth manifold]] admits a [[Riemannian metric]], and for any point in a [[Riemannian manifold]] there is a [[geodesically convex]] [[neighborhood]] (any two points in the neighborhood are connected by a unique geodesic in the neighborhood, one whose length is the distance between the points; see for example the remark after ([Milnor, lemma 10.3 on page 59](#Milnor)), or ([do Carmo, Proposition 4.2](#doCarmo))).
A nonempty intersection of finitely many such geodesically convex neighborhoods is also geodesically convex.
The inverse of the [[exponential map]] based at any
interior point of a geodesically convex open subset
gives a [[diffeomorphism]] from this subset to a star-shaped
open subset of $\mathbf{R}^n$.
Indeed, the [[Gauss lemma]] shows that the tangent
map of the exponential map is invertible.
By definition of geodesic convexity the exponential
map is injective, hence a diffeomorphism.
By [this theorem](open+ball#StarShapedOpenDiffeomorphicToOpenBall), star-shaped open subsets
of $\mathbf{R}^n$ are diffeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^n$,
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}




### Coverages of good open covers


+-- {: .num_prop #GoodOpenCoversFormACoverageOnParacompactSmooothManifolds}
###### Proposition

The [[category]] $ParaSmMfd$ of [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] [[smooth manifolds]] admits a [[coverage]] whose covering families are good open covers.

The same holds true for [[full subcategories]] such as

* [[CartSp]] -- [[Cartesian spaces]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to check this in $ParaSmMfd$.
We need to check that for $\{U_i \to U\}$ a good open cover and $f : V \to U$ any morphism, we get commuting squares

$$  
  \array{  
     V_j &\to& U_{i(j)}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     V &\stackrel{f}{\to}& U
  }
$$

such that the $\{V_i \to V\}$ form a good open cover of $V$. 

Now, while $ParaSmMfd$ does not have all [[pullbacks]], the pullback  of an [[open cover]] does exist, and since $f$ is necessarily a [[continuous function]] this is an [[open cover]] $\{f^* U_i \to V\}$. The $f^* U_i$ need not be contractible, but being open subsets of a paracompact manifold, they are themselves paracompact manifolds and hence admit themselves good open covers $\{W_{i,j} \to f^* U_i\}$.

Then the family of composites $\{W_{i,j} \to f^* U_i \to V\}$ is clearly a good open cover of $V$.

### Existence on CW complexes 

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem 

Every finite [[CW complex]] admits a good open cover. 

=--

Hopefully someone can find a clear reference to a proof. The assertion for finite CW complexes is found for example [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=dL8FCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=%22good+cover%22+%22CW+complex%22&source=bl&ots=GrZW-ZGSpU&sig=eLwTeBNnBYJuEYBJ-6JCPTPvw1g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBGoVChMIlJCJzIOGyAIVCmg-Ch2FQwlj#v=onepage&q=%22good%20cover%22%20%22CW%20complex%22&f=false) (Topology of Tiling Spaces by Sadun, p. 37). It is not immediately clear from the remarks there what obstructions would exist to generalizing the assertion to all CW complexes.

As indicated at [[CW complex]], every CW complex is *homotopy equivalent* to a simplicial complex, and simplicial complexes certainly admit good covers by taking open stars. 


### (Non-)Existence for topological manifolds

For a (paracompact) [[topological manifold]] the construction via [[Riemannian metrics]] or similar smooth constructions in general does not work. 

In ([Osborne-Stern 69](#OsborneStern69)) the following discussion for sufficient conditions getting "close" to good open covers is discussed:

Let $X$ be a [[n-connected space|k-connected]] [[topological manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ (without [[boundary]]), and define 

$$
  q \coloneqq
  min(k,n-3)
  \,.
$$ 

For $p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $p(q+1) \gt n$ then $X$ admits a cover by $p$ open balls and such that all nonempty intersections of the covering cells are [[n-connected space|(qâˆ’1)-connected]].


### Refining covers

A cover $\{U_i\to X\}_{i\in I}$ refines another cover $\{V_j\to X\}_{j\in J}$ if each map $V_j\to X$ is some $U_i\to X$.

Each differentially good cover has a unique smallest refinement to a differentially good cover that is closed under intersection.

## $n$POV

The following [[nPOV]] perspective on good open covers gives a useful general "explanation" for their relevance, which also explains the role of good covers in [[Cech cohomology]] generally and [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]  in particular.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $sPSh(CartSp)_{proj}$ be the category of [[simplicial presheaves]] on the category [[CartSp]] equipped with the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]], regarded as a 0-[[truncated]] object of $sPSh(C)$.

Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a good open cover by [[open ball]]s in the strong sense: such that every finite non-empty intersection is diffeomorphic to an $\mathbb{R}^d$.

Then: the [[Cech nerve]] $C(\{U\}) \in sPSh(C)$ is a cofibrant resolution of $X$ in the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption we have that $C(U)$ is degreewise a [[coproduct]] of [[representable functor|representables]]. It is also evidently a [[split hypercover]].

This implies the statement by the [characterization of cofibrant objects in the projective structure](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+simplicial+presheaves#CofibrantObjects).


=--

This has a useful application in the [[nerve theorem]].

Notice that the [[descent]] condition for simplicial presheaves on [[CartSp]] at (good) covers is very weak, since all [[Cartesian space]]s are topologically contractible, so it is easy to find the fibrant objects $A \in sPSh(C)_{proj, loc}$ in the [[topological localization]] of $sPSh(C)_{proj}$ for the canonical [[coverage]] of [[CartSp]]. The above observation says that for computing the $A$-valued [[cohomology]] of a [[diffeological space]] $X$, it is sufficient to evaluate $A$ on (the Cech nerve of) a good cover of $X$.


We can turn this around and speak for any [[site]] $C$ of a covering family $\{U_i \to X\}$ as being _good_ if the corresponding [[Cech nerve]] is degreewise a coproduct of representables. In the projective model structure on simplicial presheaves on $C$ such good covers will enjoy the central properties of good covers of topological spaces.
