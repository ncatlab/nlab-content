A [[topological space]] is __separable__ if it has a [[countable set|countable]] [[dense subspace|dense]] subset.

To be explicit, $X$ is separable if there exists an [[infinite sequence]] $a\colon \mathbb{N} \to X$ such that, given any point $b$ in $X$ and any [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $b$, we have $a_i \in U$ for some $i$.

Many results in [[analysis]] are easiest for separable spaces.  This is particularly true if one wishes to avoid using strong forms of the [[axiom of choice]] or to be [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] over the natural numbers.
