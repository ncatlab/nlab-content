## Definition ##

In an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$, for any object $X$ its **suspension object** $\Sigma X$ is the [[homotopy pullback|homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
     X &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\to& \Sigma X
  }
  \,,
$$

where ${*}$ is the [[terminal object]].

This is the [[mapping cone]] of the terminal map $X \to {*}$. See there for more details.

This concept is dual to that of [[loop space object]].

## Examples ##

* In [[Top]], this is the ordinary [[suspension]] of a space.
