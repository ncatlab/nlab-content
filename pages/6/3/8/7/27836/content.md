## Idea

The *weak topology* on a [[topological vector space]] $(V, \tau)$ is the [[initial topology]] induced by its [[linear functionals]] $V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that are [[continuous map|continuous]] with respect to its originally given topology $\tau$.

> Beware that in other contexts the term "[[weak topology]]" (see there) is used for other [[initial topologies]].
