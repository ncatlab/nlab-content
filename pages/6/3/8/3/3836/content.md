## Idea

The notion of _locally small $(\infty,1)$-category_ is the generalization of the notion of [[locally small category]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.

## Definitions

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
  
A [[quasi-category]] $C$ is **locally small** if for all objects $x,y \in C$ the [[hom-object in a quasi-category|hom ∞-groupoid]] $Hom_C(x,y)$ is [[essentially small (infinity,1)-category|essentially small]].

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, below prop. 5.4.1.7]].

## Properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[quasi-category]] $C$ is locally small precisely if the following equivalent condition holds:

for every [[small set]] $S$ of objects in $C$, the full [[sub-quasi-category]] on $S$ is [[essentially small (∞,1)-category|essentially small]].
