A **2-poset** is any of several concepts that generalize [[partial order|posets]] one step in [[higher category theory]]. One does not usually hear about $2$-posets by themselves but instead as special cases of $2$-[[2-category|categories]], such as the [[locally posetal 2-category|locally posetal]] ones.

$2$-posets can also be called **(1,2)-categories**, being a special case of [[(n,r)-categories]].  The concept generalizes to $n$-[[n-poset|posets]].


## Definition

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$2$-poset__ is an $\infty$-category such that all parallel pairs of $j$-morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalent]] for $j \geq 2$. Thus, up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $2$-morphisms, not even whether two given parallel $2$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition may give a concept more general than a locally posetal $2$-category for your preferred definition of $2$-category, but it will be equivalent if you ignore irrelevant data.


## Examples

* [[Pos]]
* [[Rel]]
* [[simplex category]]
* [[Lat]]
* [[DistLat]]
* [[Frm]]
* [[Locale]]
* [[HeytAlg]]
* [[BoolAlg]]

* [[allegory]]
* [[bicategory of relations]]
* [[first-order hyperdoctrine with equality]]

Just as the motivating example of a $2$-category is the $2$-category [[Cat]] of categories, so the motivating example of a $2$-poset is the $2$-poset [[Pos]] of posets.
