## Idea

Classically, a _lattice in the [[Cartesian space]]_ $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[subgroup]] (of the underlying [[topological group|topological]] [[abelian group]]) that [[spans]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$. This may be generalized, from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a general locally compact abelian group. 

## Definition 

A *lattice* in a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological abelian group|abelian group]] $A$ is a subgroup $L \hookrightarrow A$ that is [[discrete space|discrete]] and *cocompact*, meaning that the quotient group $A/L$ with the quotient topology is [[compact space|compact]].

Applying [[Pontryagin duality]], the dual of the quotient map $q: A \to A/L$ is in that case a discrete subgroup $\widehat{A/L} \hookrightarrow \widehat{A}$ which is also cocompact (its [[cokernel]] being the compact group $\widehat{L}$). This is called the *dual lattice*of $L$. 

## Examples

Notable examples of classical lattices (in $\mathbb{R}^n$ include 

* [[Leech lattice]], [[E8 lattice]] 

The standard diagonal inclusion of a global field (such as a [[number field]]) $k$ into its [[ring of adeles]] $A_k$ is a lattice in the more general sense. Recalling that $A_k$ is Pontryagin dual to itself, the lattice $k$ is identified with its dual lattice.
