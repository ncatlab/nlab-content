on [[cellular cohomology]]. 



> **Abstract.** We present a development of [[cellular]] [[ordinary cohomology|cohomology]] in [[homotopy type theory]]. [[ordinary cohomology|Cohomology]] associates to each space a sequence of [[abelian groups]] capturing part of its structure, and has the advantage over [[homotopy groups]] in that these abelian groups of many common spaces are easier to compute in many cases. Cellular cohomology is a special kind of [[ordinary cohomology|cohomology]] designed for [[cell complexes]]: these are built in stages by [[attaching space|attaching]] [[spheres]] of progressively higher [[dimension]], and cellular cohomology defines the groups out of the combinatorial description of how spheres are attached. Our main result is that for finite cell complexes, a wide class of [[cohomology theories]] (including the ones defined through [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]]) can be calculated via cellular cohomology. This result was formalized in the Agda proof assistant.
