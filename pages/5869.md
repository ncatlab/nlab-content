## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #PUH}
###### Definition


For $\mathcal{H}$ a [[Hilbert space]], the _projective unitary group_ $P U(\mathcal{H})$ is the [[quotient]] of the [[unitary group]] $U(\mathcal{H})$ by its [[center]] $Z U(\mathcal{H}) \simeq U(1)$, the [[circle group]]

$$
 P U(\mathcal{H}) := U(\mathcal{H})/U(1)
  \,.
$$


=--

This is naturally a [[topological group]]. For $\mathcal{H}$ of finite-[[dimension]] $n$ $P U(n) := P U(\mathcal{H})$ is also naturally a [[Lie group]].


## Properties

### Homotopy type

+-- {: .num_prop #KZ2}
###### Prop

If $\mathcal{H}$ is an infinite-[[dimension]]al [[separable Hilbert space]] the underlying [[topological space]] of its projective unitary group has the [[homotopy type]] of an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[unitary group]] $U(\mathcal{H})$ in this case is [[contractible]] (by [[Kuiper's theorem]]) and the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ [[action|acts]] free and faithfully on it. Therefore the quotient map $U(\mathcal{H}) \to P U(\mathcal{H})$ is a model for the [[circle group]]-[[universal principal bundle]] and in particular the topological space underlying $P U(\mathcal{H})$ is equivalent to the [[classifying space]] $B U(1) \simeq B^2 \mathbb{Z} \simeq K(\mathbb{Z},2)$.

###### Prop

For $\mathcal{H}$ an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space $P U(\mathcal{H})$-[[principal bundle]]s over a [[topological space]] $X$ are classidied by third [[integral cohomology]] of $X$

$$
  P U(\mathcal{H}) Bund(X) \simeq H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{KZ2} we have that the [[classifying space]] of $P U(\mathcal{H})$ itself is an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]]

$$
 B P U(\mathcal{H})
  \simeq
  B B U(1)
  \simeq
  B^3 \mathbb{Z}
  \simeq
  K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)
  \,.
$$

This is the classifying space for degree-3 integral cohomology (see [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for more on this).

+-- {: .num_prop #ClassesOfPUHBundles}
###### Prop

Every [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle]]/[[bundle gerbe]] on $X$ is equivalent to the [[lifting gerbe]] of some $P U(\mathcal{H})$-principal bundle to a $U(\mathcal{H})$-bundle, and the equivalence classes of these structures correspond uniquely.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[twisted bundle]]s of a given bundle gerbe are given by the [[twisted cohomology]] relative to the morphism $\mathbf{B} P U(\mathcal{H}) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ that is part of the long [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \mathbf{B} U(1) \to \mathbf{B} U(\mathcal{H}) \to B \mathbf{P} U(\mathcal{H}) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  \,.
$$

Since the topological space underlying $U(\mathcal{H})$ is contractible, on the underlying topological spaces this is

$$
  K(\mathbb{Z},2) \to * \to K(\mathbb{Z},3) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)
  \,.
$$

This means that the morphism that sends $P U(\mathcal{H})$-bundles to the twist that they induce is an isomorphism.

### Action on Fredholm operators

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space.

Since by the above $PU(\mathcal{H}) \simeq B U(1)$ and since there is a canonical action of [[line bundles]] on complex vector bundles, hence on the [[topological K-theory]] of a manifold $X$, there must also be a natural action of $PU(\mathcal{H}) \times Fred \to Fred$ of $PU(\mathcal{H})$ on the space of [[Fredholm operators]] (on connected components).

This is given by letting a projective unitary act by conjugation on a Fredholm operator: $(g, F) \mapsto g F g^{-1}$.
