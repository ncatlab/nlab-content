## Idea

**Deduction** is the process of passing from premises to conclusion in such a way that the [[truth]] of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive [[logic]] studies what it is for an argument to be **valid**.

A formalization of the process of deductive reasoning is provided by the system called _[[natural deduction]]_.
