## Idea

**Deduction** is the process of passing from [[premises]] to [[conclusions]] in such a way that the [[truth]] of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive [[logic]] studies what it is for an argument to be **valid**.

## Formalizations

A formalization of the process of deductive reasoning are [[deductive systems]] in [[logical frameworks]] such as _[[natural deduction]]_ and _[[sequent calculus]]_.
