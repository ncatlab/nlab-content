## Idea

The notion of  _Klein geometry_ is essentially that of _[[homogeneous space]]_ in the context of [[differential geometry]].

Klein geometries form the _local models_ for [[Cartan geometries]].

For the generalization of Klein geometry to [[higher category theory]] see [[higher Klein geometry]].


## Definition

A **Klein geometry** is a pair $(G, H)$ where $G$ is a 
[[Lie group]] and $H$ is a closed Lie subgroup of $G$ such that the (left) [[coset space]] 

$$
   X \coloneqq G/H
$$ 

is [[connected space|connected]]. $G$ [[action|acts]] [[transitive action|transitively]] on the homogeneous space $X$. We may think of $H\hookrightarrow G$ as the [[stabilizer subgroup]] of a point in $X$.

See there at _[Examples -- Stabilizers of shapes / Klein geometry](stabilizer+group#KleinGeometry)_.


## Examples

* For $G = E(n)$, the [[Euclidean group]] in $n$-dimensions; $H = O(n)$, the [[orthogonal group]]; then, $X$ is $n$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]].

* Analogously, for $G = Iso(d,1)$ the [[Poincare group]] of $(d+1)$-dimensional [[Minkowski space]], and $H = SO(d,1)$ the [[special orthogonal group]] of rotations and [[Lorentz boosts]], then $X = \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ is [[Minkowski space]] itself.

  Passing to the corresponding [[Cartan geometry]] -- by what physicists call _gauging_ -- yields the [[first order formulation of gravity]].
