A **Klein geometry** is a pair $(G, H)$ where $G$ is a Lie group and $H$ is a closed Lie subgroup of $G$ such that the (left) coset space $X = G/H$ is connected. $G$ acts transitively on the homogeneous space $X$. We may think of $H$ as the [[stabilizer]] of a point in $X$.

###Example###
* $G = E(n)$, the Euclidean group in $n$-dimensions; $H = O(n)$, the orthogonal group; then, $X$ is $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.

Klein geometries may be generalized to [[Cartan geometry|Cartan geometries]].
