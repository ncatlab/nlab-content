## Idea

The basic definition of a [[manifold]] (especially a [[smooth manifold]]) is as a space locally modeled on a finite-dimensional [[Cartesian space]]. This can be generalized to a notion of smooth manifolds locally modeled on infinite-dimensional [[topological vector spaces]]. Typical examples of these are [[mapping spaces]] between finite-dimensional manifolds, such as [[loop space]]s.
