## Idea

The [[associative algebra]] of [[matrices]] over some [[ring]] under [[matrix multiplication]] is the coresponding _matrix algebra_.

## Properties

### Relation to groupoid algebras

The algebra of $n \times n$-matrices is equivalently the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of the [[pair groupoid]] on the set with $n$-elements.
