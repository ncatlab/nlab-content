## Idea


A kind of [[topological space]] about which one can reason "effectively", hence [[constructive mathematics|constructively]]. Used in [[computable analysis]], see at _[[computable function (analysis)]]_.

## Related concepts

* [[formal topology]] Every effective topological space $X$ defines a formal space. If 
$X$ is `constructively complete`, then the formal points of $X$ coincide with its effective points; see [Spreen10](#Spreen10).
* [[equilogical space]]
