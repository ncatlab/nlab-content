## Idea

When formulating a [[theory of physics]] in terms of [[mathematics]] one typically models the range of certain physical quantities by [[torsors]] over some [[group]] of transformations.  

For instance a [[wavelength]] would be identified as element in the [[real line]] minus its origin, $\mathbb{R}-\{0\}$ , being a torsor over the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathbb{R}^\times$ of [[real numbers]]. 

In order for the "[[coordination]]" of the mathematical theory with physical [[experiment]] to take place, one needs to choose an identification of this abstract torsor with the (idealized) one that it is supposed to model in nature. Such a choice is equivalent to a choice of [[unit]] (in the mathematical sense), hence a choice of element of the torsor. In this context this is then a _physical unit_. 

For instance picking an element in $\mathbb{R}-\{0\}$ and declaring this to be 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum means defining a _physical unit of length_ (in this example:  of the [[meter]]).

Physical units are often called _physical constants_. But by definition physical units are arbitrary choices made in the desciption of a physical system. Of course once made, one wants to keep these choices constant, such as to be useful. 

The actual _constants of nature_ are instead quotients of physical units. For instance the [[fine structure constant]] is the [[quotient]]

$$
  \alpha \coloneqq \frac{e^2}{ (4 \pi \epsilon_0) \hbar c} \in \mathbb{R}
$$

where $e$ is the [[electric charge]] of the [[electron]] expressed in physical units of charge ([[Volt]]), $\hbar$ is [[Planck's constant]] etc. The resulting quotient is then independent of any choices and is hence a [[real number]] characterizing nature independently of any conventions about how to parameterize it.
