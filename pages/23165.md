## Idea

What has come to be called __Stein duality__ establishes an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]]
between a certain [[category]] of [[complex algebras]]
and a certain category of [[Stein spaces]]
in a completely analogous manner
to the equivalence between [[commutative rings]] and [[affine schemes]],
and, more closely, [[C^∞-rings]] and [[smooth loci]] (see also at *[[duality between algebra and geometry]]*).

## Preliminaries

Recall that a [[Stein manifold]] is a [[complex manifold]]
that admits a proper holomorphic [[immersion]] into some $C^n$.
More generally, a [[Stein space]] is a [[complex analytic space]]
(i.e., a [[locally ringed space]] that is locally isomorphic to the vanishing locus of some ideal of [[holomorphic functions]] on~$C^n$)
whose reduction is a [[Stein manifold]].
A Stein spaces is __globally finitely presented__
if it admits a closed embedding in $C^n$ whose defining ideal is globally finitely generated.

## Definition

(See Proposition~1.13 in Pridham.)
The category of globally [[finitely presented object|finitely presented]] [[Stein spaces]]
is [[contravariant functor|contravariantly]] [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[finitely presented object|finitely presented]]
[[EFC-algebras]].
The equivalence functor sends a [[Stein space]] to its EFC-algebra of [[global sections]].

(See Theorem~3.23 in Pirkovskii.)
The category of [[Stein spaces]] of finite embedding dimension
is contravariantly equivalent to the category of finitely generated [[EFC-algebras]].
The equivalence functor sends a [[Stein space]] to its [[EFC-algebra]] of global sections.
