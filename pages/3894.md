## Idea

A **G-structure** on an $n$-[[manifold]] $M$, for a given structure group $G$, is a $G$-subbundle of the [[frame bundle]] (of the [[tangent bundle]]) of $M$. 

Equivalently, this means that a $G$-structure is a choice of [[reduction of structure groups|reduction]] of the canonical structure group $GL(n)$ of the [[principal bundle]] to which the [[tangent bundle]] is [[associated bundle|associated]] along the given inclusion $G \hookrightarrow GL(n)$.

More generally, one can consider the case $G$ is not a [[subgroup]] but equipped with any group homomorphism $G \to GL(n)$. If this is instead an [[epimorphism]] one speaks of a [[lift of structure groups]].

Both cases, in turn, can naturally be understood as special cases of [[twisted differential c-structures]], which is a notion that applies more generally to [[principal infinity-bundles]].

## Definition

### Traditional

(...)

### In terms of higher geometry

We give an equivalent definition of $G$-structures in terms of [[higher geometry]] ("from the [[nPOV]]"). This serves to clarify the slightly subtle but important difference between existence and choice of $G$-structure, and seamlessly embeds the notion into the more general context of [[twisted differential c-structures]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $G \to K$ be a [[homomorphism]] of [[Lie groups]]. Write 

$$
  \mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K
$$

for the morphism of [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoids]] ( the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stacks]] of smooth $K$- and $G$-[[principal bundles]], respectively).

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] (or generally an [[orbifold]] or [[Lie groupoid]], etc.) Let $P \to X$ be a $K$-[[principal bundle]] and let $g : X \to \mathbf{B}K$ be any choice of morphism representing it.

Write $\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)$ etc. for the [[derived hom space|hom-groupoid]] of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoids]] / smooth stacks . This is equivalently the groupoid of $G$-principal bundles over $X$ and smooth [[gauge transformations]] between them.

Then the **groupoid of $G$-structure on $P$** (with respect to the given morphism $G \to K$) is the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \mathbf{c}Struc_{[P]}(X)
  :=
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
   \times_{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}K)}
  \{P\}
  \,.
$$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{c}Struc_{[P]}(X)
    &\to&
    *
    \\
    \downarrow & \swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{g}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
     &\stackrel{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{c})}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}K)
  }
$$

(the groupoid of _[[twisted differential c-structure|twisted c-structures]]_).

Specifically, when $X$ is a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$, the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ canonically comes from a morphism $T X : X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ into the [[moduli stack]] for the [[general linear group]] $K := GL(n)$. Then for any group homomorphism $G \to GL(n)$, a **$G$-structure** on $X$ is a $G$-structure on $T X$, as above.

### Integrability

For the moment see at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to special holonomy

The existence of $G$-structures on tangent bundles of [[Riemannian manifolds]] is closely related to these having [[special holonomy]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]]
of [[dimension]] $n$ with [[holonomy group]]  $Hol(g) \subset O(n)$.

For $G \subset O(n)$ some other [[subgroup]], $(X,g)$ admits a torsion-free 
G-structure precisely if $Hol(g)$ is [[adjoint action|conjugate]] to 
a [[subgroup]] of $G$.

Moreover, the space of such $G$-structures is the [[coset]] $G/L$,
where $L$ is the group of elements suchthat conjugating $Hol(g)$ with them
lands in $G$.

## Examples

### Reduction of tangent bundle structure

* For the [[subgroup]] of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ of matrices of positive determinant, a $GL(n, \mathbb{R})^+$-structure defines an [[orientation]].

* For the [[orthogonal group]], an $O(n)$-structure defines a [[Riemannian metric]]. (See the discussion at [[vielbein]] and at

* For the [[special linear group]], an $SL(n,R)$-structure defines a [[volume form]]. 

* For the trivial group, an $\{e\}$-structure consists of an [[absolute parallelism]] of the manifold.

* For $n = 2 m$ even, a $GL(m, \mathbb{C})$-structure defines an [[almost complex structure]] on the manifold. It must satisfy an integrability condition to be a [[complex structure]].

### Lift of tangent bundle structure

An example for a lift of structure groups is

* for the [[spin group]]  $spin(n)$, a $G$-structure is a [[spin structure]].

This continues with lifts to the 

* [[string group]] giving [[string structure]];

* [[fivebrane group]] giving [[fivebrane structure]].

### Reduction of more general bundle structure
 {#ExamplesOfReductionsOfNonTangentBundles}

* For general $G \to K$, the corresponding notion of [[Cartan geometry]] involves $G$-structure on $K$-principal bundles (not necessarily underlying a tangent bundle).

* A $U(n,n) \hookrightarrow O(2n,2n)$-structure is a [[generalized complex structure]];

* For $H_n \to E_{n(n)}$ the inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]] into the [[split real form]] of an [[exceptional Lie group]], the corresponding structure is an [[exceptional generalized geometry]].

## Further issues

> Need to talk about integrability conditions, and those of higher degree. Also need to discuss [[pseudo-group|pseudo-groups]].
