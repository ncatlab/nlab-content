## Idea

A **G-structure** on an $n$-[[manifold]] $M$, for a given structure group $G$, is a $G$-subbundle of the [[frame bundle]] (of the [[tangent bundle]]) of $M$. 

Equivalently, this means that a $G$-structure is a choice of [[reduction of structure groups|reduction]] of the canonical structure group $GL(n)$ of the [[principal bundle]] to which the [[tangent bundle]] is [[associated bundle|associated]] along the given inclusion $G \hookrightarrow GL(n)$.

More generally, one can consider the case $G$ is not a [[subgroup]] but equipped with any group homomorphism $G \to GL(n)$. If this is instead an [[epimorphism]] one speaks of a [[lift of structure groups]].

Both cases, in turn, can naturally be understood as special cases of [[twisted differential c-structures]], which is a notion that applies more generally to [[principal infinity-bundles]].

## Definition

### General

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ and given a [[Lie group|Lie]] [[subgroup]] $G \hookrightarrow GL(n)$ of the [[general linear group]], then a _$G$-structure_ on $X$ is a [[reduction of structure groups|reduction of the structure group]] of the [[frame bundle]] of $X$ to $G$.

There are many more explicit (and more abstract) equivalent ways to say this, which we discuss below. There are also many evident variants and generalizations. 

Notably one may consider reductions of the frames in the $k$th order [[jet bundle]]. (e. g. [Alekseevskii](#Alekseevskii)) This yields order $k$ $G$-structure and the ordinary $G$-structures above are then first order.

Moreover, the definition makes sense for generalized [[manifolds]] modeled on other base spaces than just [[Cartesian spaces]]. In particular there is an evident generalization to [[supermanifolds]] spring

###### Definition

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ with [[frame bundle]] $Fr(X)$, and given a [[Lie group]] [[monomorphism]]

$$
  G \longrightarrow GL(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

into the [[general linear group]], then a _$G$-structure_ on $X$ is an $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ equipped with an inclusion of [[fiber bundles]]

$$
  \array{
    P &&\hookrightarrow&& Fr(X)
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

which is $G$-equivariant.

###### Remark

From this perspective, a $G$-structure consists of the collection of all $G$-[[frame field|frames]] on a manifold. For instance for an [[orthogonal structure]] it consists of all those frames which are pointwise an [[orthonormal basis]] of the [[tangent bundle]] (with respect to the [[Riemannian metric]] which is defined by the orthonormal structure).

=--

Accordingly: 

+-- {: .num_defn #GStructureGeneratedByFrameField}
###### Definition

Given $G \hookrightarrow GL(n)$ and given any one [[frame field]] $\sigma \colon X \to Fr(X)$ over a [[manifold]] $X$, then acting with $G$ on $\sigma$ at each point produces a $G$-subbundle. This is called the $G$-structure _generated_ by the frame field $\sigma$.

### In terms of Cartan connections

A $G$-structure equipped with compatible [[connection on a bundle|connection]] data is equivalently a [[Cartan connection]] for the inclusion $(G \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \rtimes G)$. 

See at _[Cartan connection -- Examples -- G-structures](Cartan+connection#ExampleGStructures)_

### In terms of higher differential geometry

We give an equivalent definition of $G$-structures in terms of [[higher differential geometry]] ("from the [[nPOV]]"). This serves to clarify the slightly subtle but important difference between existence and choice of $G$-structure, and seamlessly embeds the notion into the more general context of [[twisted differential c-structures]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $G \to K$ be a [[homomorphism]] of [[Lie groups]]. Write 

$$
  \mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K
$$

for the morphism of [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoids]] ( the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stacks]] of smooth $K$- and $G$-[[principal bundles]], respectively).

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] (or generally an [[orbifold]] or [[Lie groupoid]], etc.) Let $P \to X$ be a $K$-[[principal bundle]] and let 

$$
  k \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}K
$$ 

be any choice of morphism [[modulating morphism|modulating]] it.

Write $\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)$ etc. for the [[derived hom space|hom-groupoid]] of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoids]] / smooth stacks . This is equivalently the groupoid of $G$-principal bundles over $X$ and smooth [[gauge transformations]] between them.

Then the **groupoid of $G$-structure on $P$** (with respect to the given morphism $G \to K$) is the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \mathbf{c}Struc_{[P]}(X)
  :=
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
   \times_{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}K)}
  \{k\}
  \,.
$$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{c}Struc_{[P]}(X)
    &\longrightarrow&
    \ast
    \\
    \downarrow & \swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{k}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
     &\stackrel{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{c})}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}K)
  }
$$

(the groupoid of _[[twisted differential c-structure|twisted c-structures]]_).


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If here $k$ is trivial in that it factors through the point, $k \colon X \to \ast \to \mathbf{B}K$ then this homotopy fiber product is $\mathbf{H}(X,K/G)$, where $K/G$ is the [[coset space]] ([[Klein geometry]]) which itself sits in the [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
   K/G \to \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Specifically, when $X$ is a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$, the [[frame bundle]] $Fr(X)$ is [[modulating moprhism|modulated]] by a morphism $\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ into the [[moduli stack]] for the [[general linear group]] $K := GL(n)$. Then for any group homomorphism $G \to GL(n)$, a **$G$-structure** on $X$ is a $G$-structure on $Fr(X)$, as above.

## Properties

### Integrability of $G$-structure

+-- {: .num_defn #Integrability}
###### Definition

A $G$-structure on a [[manifold]] $X$ is called _locally flat_ ([Sternberg 64, section VII, def. 24](#Sternberg64)) or _integrable_ (e.g. [Alekseevskii](#Alekseevskii)) if it is locally equivalent to the _standard flat $G$-structure_, def. \ref{StandardFlatGStructure}. 

This means that there is an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ by [[open subsets]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the restriction of the $G$-structure to each of these is equivalent to the standard flat $G$-structure.

=--


See at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_ for more on this

The [[obstruction]] to integrability of $G$-structure is the _[[torsion of a G-structure]]_. See there for more.


### Relation to special holonomy

The existence of $G$-structures on tangent bundles of [[Riemannian manifolds]] is closely related to these having [[special holonomy]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]]
of [[dimension]] $n$ with [[holonomy group]]  $Hol(g) \subset O(n)$.

For $G \subset O(n)$ some other [[subgroup]], $(X,g)$ admits a torsion-free 
G-structure precisely if $Hol(g)$ is [[adjoint action|conjugate]] to 
a [[subgroup]] of $G$.

Moreover, the space of such $G$-structures is the [[coset]] $G/L$,
where $L$ is the group of elements suchthat conjugating $Hol(g)$ with them
lands in $G$.

This appears as ([Joyce prop. 3.1.8](#Joyce))


## Examples

### The standard flat $G$-structure
 {#TheStandardFlatGStructure}

+-- {: .num_defn #StandardFlatGStructure}
###### Definition

For $G \hookrightarrow GL(n)$ a subgroup, then the _standard flat $G$-structure_ on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $G$-structure which is generated, via def. \ref{GStructureGeneratedByFrameField}, from the canonical [[frame field]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (the one which is the identity at each point, under the defining identifications).

=--

### Reduction of tangent bundle structure

* For the [[subgroup]] of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ of matrices of positive determinant, a $GL(n, \mathbb{R})^+$-structure defines an [[orientation]].

* For the [[orthogonal group]], an $O(n)$-structure defines a [[Riemannian metric]]. (See the discussion at [[vielbein]] and at

* For the [[special linear group]], an $SL(n,R)$-structure defines a [[volume form]]. 

* For the trivial group, an $\{e\}$-structure consists of an [[absolute parallelism]] of the manifold.

* For $n = 2 m$ even, a $GL(m, \mathbb{C})$-structure defines an [[almost complex structure]] on the manifold. It must satisfy an integrability condition to be a [[complex structure]].

### Lift of tangent bundle structure

An example for a lift of structure groups is

* for the [[spin group]]  $spin(n)$, a $G$-structure is a [[spin structure]].

This continues with lifts to the 

* [[string group]] giving [[string structure]];

* [[fivebrane group]] giving [[fivebrane structure]].

### Reduction of more general bundle structure
 {#ExamplesOfReductionsOfNonTangentBundles}

* For general $G \to K$, the corresponding notion of [[Cartan geometry]] involves $G$-structure on $K$-principal bundles (not necessarily underlying a tangent bundle).

* A $U(n,n) \hookrightarrow O(2n,2n)$-structure is a [[generalized complex structure]];

* For $H_n \to E_{n(n)}$ the inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]] into the [[split real form]] of an [[exceptional Lie group]], the corresponding structure is an [[exceptional generalized geometry]].
