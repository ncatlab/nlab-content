An algebraic theory is a concept in [[universal algebra]] that describes a specific type of algebraic gadget, such as [[group|groups]] or [[ring|rings]]. An individual group or ring is a _model_ of the appropriate theory. Roughly speaking, an algebraic theory consists of a specification of operations and laws that these operations must satisfy.

Traditionally, algebraic theories were described in terms of [[logic]]. But _finitary_ algebraic theories (that is, those involving only finitary operations) can be understood category-theoretically as [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]]. However, there are also infinitary algebraic theories (such as an algebra in which arbitrary sums are possible, one model of which is $[0,\infty]$).

Algebraic theories (finitary or otherwise) can also be understood through [[monad]]s; in fact, Johnstone defines an [[algebraic category]] as one that is monadic over [[Set]] (although there are some size issues here).  For example, the theory of a [[compact Hausdorff space]] $X$ can be seen as algebraic, with one operation for each [[direction|directed set]] $D$ that takes an [[net|ultranet]] indexed by $D$ to its limit; this is a finitary operation only when $D$ is finite (which is really the trivial case).  There is no Lawvere theory for compact Hausdorff spaces, yet there is a monad for it, which maps each set $S$ to its set of [[ultrafilter]]s.

_[[essentially algebraic theory|Essentially algebraic theories]]_ allow for partially-defined operations. Just as finitary algebraic theories can be understood as Lawvere theories, which live in the [[doctrine]] of [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal categories]], so finitary essentially algebraic theories can be understood by a generalisation to [[finitely complete category|finitely complete categories]].
