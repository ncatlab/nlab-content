## Idea

Kähler manifolds are analogues in [[complex geometry]] of [[Riemannian manifolds]] in real [[differential geometry]].


A Riemannian manifold is a real [[smooth manifold]] equipped with a nondegenerate smooth symmetric 2-form $g$ (the [[Riemannian metric]]), while an __almost Kähler manifold__ is a complex holomorphic manifold equipped with a nondegenerate hermitian 2-form $h$ (the __Kähler $2$-form__).  The real cotangent bundle is replaced with the complex cotangent bundle, and symmetry is replaced with hermitian symmetry. An almost Kähler manifold is a __Kähler manifold__ if it satisfies an additional integrability condition.

The Kähler 2-form can be decomposed as $h = g+i\omega$; here $g$ is a riemannian metric and $\omega$ a [[symplectic form]]. There is a unique up to a scalar hermitian metric on a complex projective space (which can be normalized), the Fubini--Study metric. All analytic subvarieties of a complex projective space are in fact [[algebraic variety|algebraic subvarieties]] and they inherit the Kähler structure from the projective space. Examples include complex tori $\mathbb{C}^n/L$ where $L$ is a lattice in $\mathbb{C}^n$, K3-surfaces, compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, quadrics, products of projective spaces and so on.

Kähler manifolds were first introduced and studied by P. A. Shirokov (cf. [a historical article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1070/RM1995v050n02ABEH002098)) and later independently by Kähler.
