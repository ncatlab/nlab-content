## Idea

A _K&#228;hler manifold_ is a [[smooth manifold]] compatibly equipped with 

1. [[complex structure]];

1. [[Riemannian structure]];

1. [[symplectic structure]].

If the symplectic structure is not compatibly present, it is just a [[Hermitian manifold]].

| [[complex structure]] | + [[Riemannian structure]] | + [[symplectic structure]] |
|--|--|--|
[[complex structure]] | [[Hermitian structure]] | [[Kähler structure]] |

Where a Riemannian manifold is a real [[smooth manifold]] equipped with a nondegenerate smooth symmetric 2-form $g$ (the [[Riemannian metric]]), an __almost K&#228;hler manifold__ is a [[complex manifold|complex holomorphic manifold]] equipped with a nondegenerate hermitian 2-form $h$ (the __K&#228;hler $2$-form__).  The real [[cotangent bundle]] is replaced with the complex cotangent bundle, and symmetry is replaced with hermitian symmetry. An almost K&#228;hler manifold is a __K&#228;hler manifold__ if it satisfies an additional integrability condition.

The K&#228;hler 2-form can be decomposed as $h = g+i\omega$; here $g$ is a [[Riemannian metric]] and $\omega$ a [[symplectic form]]. 

## Definition

### In terms of $G$-Structure
 {#InTermsOfGStructure}

A K&#228;hler manifold is a [[integrability of G-structure|first-order integrable]] [[almost Hermitian structure]], hence a first order integrable [[G-structure]] for $G = U(n) \hookrightarrow GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ the [[unitary group]] (e.g. [Verbitsky 09](#Verbitsky09)).

By the fact (see at _[unitary group -- relation to orthogonal, symplectic and general linear group](unitary+group#RelationToOrthogonalSymplecticAndGeneralLinearGroup)_) that $U(n) \simeq O(2n) \underset{GL(2n,\mathbb{R})}{\times} Sp(2n,\mathbb{R}) \underset{GL(2n,\mathbb{R})}{\times} GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ this means that a K&#228;hler manifold structure is precisely a joint [[orthogonal structure]]/[[Riemannian manifold]] structure, [[symplectic manifold]] structure and [[complex manifold]] structure.



## Examples
 {#Examples}

The archetypical elementary example is the following:

+-- {: .num_example #StandardAlmostKaehlerVectorSpaces}
###### Example
**(standard K&#228;hler vector space)**

Let $V \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^2$ be the 2-dimensional [[real vector space]] equipped with the [[complex structure]] $J$ which is given by the canonical identification $\mathbb{R}^2 \simeq \mathbb{C}$, hence, in terms of the canonical [[linear basis]] $(e_i)$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, this is

$$
  J = (J^i{}_j) 
  \coloneqq 
  \left( 
    \array{
      0 & -1
      \\
      1 & 0
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Moreover let 

$$
  \omega = (\omega_{i j}) \coloneqq \left( \array{0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0} \right)
$$ 

and 

$$
  g = (g_{i j}) \coloneqq \left( \array{ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1}  \right)
  \,.
$$ 

Then $(V, J, \omega, g)$ is a Kähler vector vector space, hence a Kähler manifold if $\mathbb{R}^2$ is regarded as a [[smooth manifold]] in the standar way and if these [[bilinear forms]] $J, \omega g$ are extended as constant rank-2 [[tensors]] over this manifold.

This is elementary, but, for the record, here is one way to make it fully explicit (we use [[Einstein summation convention]] and "$\cdot$" denotes [[matrix multiplication]]):

###### Example

There is a unique (up to a scalar) hermitian metric on  [[complex projective space]] (which may be normalized), the _[[Fubini-Study metric]]_. 

All analytic subvarieties of a complex projective space are in fact [[algebraic variety|algebraic subvarieties]] and they inherit the K&#228;hler structure from the projective space. 

Examples include [[complex tori]] $\mathbb{C}^n/L$ where $L$ is a lattice in $\mathbb{C}^n$, [[K3-surfaces]], compact [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]], quadrics, products of projective spaces and so on.

## Properties

### Relation to (almost) complex manifold

> The following based on [this MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/73330/381) by [[Spiro Karigiannis]]

When $(X, J)$ is an [[almost complex manifold]], then there is a notion of smooth complex-valued [[differential forms]] of type $(p,q)$. A complex valued $2$-form $\omega$ is of type $(1,1)$ precisely if it satisfies 

$$
  \omega(J v,J w) = \omega(v,w)
$$ 

for all smooth [[vector fields]] $v,w$ on $X$. Here $\omega$ is a *real* $2$-form of type $(1,1)$, if $\overline \omega = \omega$. Setting

$$
  g(v,w) = \omega(v, J w), 
$$

defines a smooth symmetric rank $(2,0)$ [[tensor field]]. This is a
[[Riemannian metric]] precisely if it is fiberwise a [[positive definite bilinear form]]. If it $g(-,-) = \omega(-,J -)$ is hence a Riemannian metric, then $\omega(-,-)$ is called positive definite, too.

The triple of data $(J, \omega, g)$, where $J$ is an [[almost complex structure]], $\omega$ is a real positive $(1,1)$-[[differential form]], and $g$ is the associated [[Riemannian metric]] this way define an *[[almost Hermitian manifold]]*. 

Now the condition for $X$ to be a K&#228;hler is that $X$ be a [[complex manifold]] ($J$ is integrable) and that $d\omega = 0$. 
Equivalently that for the [[Levi-Civita connection]] $\nabla$ of $G$ we have $\nabla \omega = 0$ or $\nabla J = 0$. 

Hence given a [[complex manifold]] $X$, together with a  *closed* real $2$-form $\omega$, the only additional condition required to ensure that it defines a  K&#228;hler metric is that it be a positive $(1,1)$-form.

### Relation to symplectic manifolds

Lifting a [[symplectic manifold]] structure to a K&#228;hler manifold structure is also called choosing a _[[Kähler polarization]]_.

### Relation to Spin-structures

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A spin structure on a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Hermitian manifold]] ([[Kähler manifold]]) $X$ of complex [[dimension]] $n$ exists precisely if, equivalently

* there is a choice of [[square root]] $\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}$ of the [[canonical line bundle]] $\Omega^{n,0}$ (a "[[Theta characteristic]]"); 

* there is a trivialization of the [[first Chern class]] $c_1(T X)$ of the [[tangent bundle]].

=--

In this case one has:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[natural isomorphism]] 

$$
  S_X \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet}_X \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}_X
$$ 

of the [[sheaf]] of [[sections]] of the [[spinor bundle]] $S_X$ on $X$ with the [[tensor product]] of the  [[Dolbeault complex]] with the corresponding [[Theta characteristic]];


Moreover, the corresponding [[Dirac operator]] is the [[Dolbeault-Dirac operator]] $\overline{\partial} + \overline{\partial}^\ast$.

=--

This is due to ([Hitchin 74](#Hitchin74)). A textbook account is for instance in ([Friedrich 74, around p. 79 and p. 82](#Friedrich74)).

### Hodge star operator
 {#HodgeStarOperator}

On a K&#228;hler manifold $\Sigma$ of [[dimension]] $dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma) = n$ the [[Hodge star operator]] acts on the [[Dolbeault complex]] as

$$
  \star \;\colon\; \Omega^{p,q}(X) \longrightarrow \Omega^{n-q,n-p}(X)
  \,.
$$

(notice the exchange of the role of $p$ and $q$) See e.g. ([BiquerdH&#246;ring 08, p. 79](#BiquerdHoering08)).


### Hodge structure
 {#HodgeStructure}

The [[Hodge theorem]] asserts that for a compact K&#228;hler manifold, the canonical $(p,q)$-grading of its [[differential forms]] descends to its [[de Rham cohomology]]/[[ordinary cohomology]]. The resulting structure is called a _[[Hodge structure]]_, and is indeed the archetypical example of such.
