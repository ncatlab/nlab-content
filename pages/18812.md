## Idea


In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] a _[[vacuum state]]_ is the information needed to turn a product of field [[observables]] such as $\mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)$ into a [[function]] (or rather: [[generalized function]]/[[distribution]]) of the insertion points $x$ any $y$, namely the [[n-point function]] (here [[2-point function]], also called the _[[Hadamard propagator]]_)

$$
  \langle \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)\rangle
$$

which may be regarded as the [[probability amplitude]] for a quantum in state $b$ at spacetime point $y$ to turn into a quantum in state $a$ at spacetime point $x$, _in the given state_ that the fields are in, which is defined thereby (see at _[[state in AQFT]]_).

In the [[worldline formalism]] of field theories these _[[propagators]]_ arise from a 1-dimensional [[field theory]] on the "[[worldline]]" of ([[virtual particle|virtual]]) [[particles]] running from $y$ to $x$.

Now by the very definition of [[perturbative string theory]], these particles are replaced by [[strings]] whose dynamics is now encoded in a 2d field theory on the [[worldsheet]] of strings, specifically a [[2d superconformal field theory]] ([[2d SCFT]]) of [[central charge]] 15. Hence now it is the _[[2d SCFT]]_ which defines the _[[vacuum state]]_ that the perturbative string theory is in. 

This is then called a _[[perturbative string theory vacuum]]_.

If this [[2d SCFT]] arises from [[quantization]] of a [[sigma-model]], then this is called a _geometric background_, otherwise it is a purely algebraically defined _[[non-geometric string vacuum]]_.

In practice full [[2d SCFTs]] are hard to construct, and often one considers them by [[perturbative quantum field theories|perturbation theory]] of a "[[sigma-model]]" which is defined by a [[spacetime]] manifold equipped with extra [[field (physics)|fields]] (e.g. the [[B-field]] etc.). It turns out that to low order these [[background field]] configurations that define [[sigma-model]] [[2d SCFTs]] are given by [[solutions]] to [[equations of motion]] of [[supergravity]] theories (e.g. [[type II supergravity]] for [[type II string theory]], etc.)

Therefore often such [[supergravity]] solutions equipped with some extra data that makes them consistent CFT backgrounds at higher order are referred to as _vacua_ for string theory. But this is in general a coarse approximation. The full vacua are the full [[2d SCFTs]] that define the [[worldsheet]] theory of the string.

The collection of all string vacua, possibly subject to some assumptions, has come to be called the _[[landscape of string theory vacua]]_.
