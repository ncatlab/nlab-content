## In algebra and analysis

In [[algebra]] and [[analysis]] a _coefficient_ is an element of a [[ring]] $R$ (a [[number]]) which multiplies another fixed element. For instance for [[polynomial]] $\sum_n a_n x^n $ over $R$ in a [[variable]] $x$, the $a_n \in R$ are the coefficients of $x^n$.

## In cohomology and homology

In [[cohomology]] _coefficients_ are what the cohomology takes values in. For [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^\bullet(-,A)$ the [[abelian group]] $A$ is the _coefficient group_. For [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] the given [[spectrum]] $E$  that [[Brown representability|represents]] it is the _coefficient spectrum_. Dually for [[homology]]. 

It is this notion of "coefficient" that appears in terms like

* [[universal coefficient theorem]]

* [[local system of coefficients]]

* [[local coefficient bundle]]
