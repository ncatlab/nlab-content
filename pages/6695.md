## Definition

### For maps between topological spaces

A [[function]]  $f : X \to Y$ between [[topological space]]s  is called __closed__ if the [[image]] of every [[closed set]] in $X$ is also open in $Y$.

Recall that $f$ is a __[[continuous map]]__ if the [[preimage]] of every [[closed subspace|closed set]] in $Y$ is closed in $X$.  For defining closed maps typically one restricts attention to closed [[continuous map]]s, although it also makes sense to speak of closed functions that are not continuous.

See also [[open map]] (from which the above was blatantly adapted).
