###### Definition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,n)-category]]. We say that

* $C$ **has adjoints for morphisms** if in its [[homotopy 2-category]] every [[morphism]] has a [[left adjoint]] and a [[right adjoint]];

* for $1 \lt k \lt n$ that $C$ **has adjoints for [[k-morphism]]s** if for every pair $X,Y \in C$ of [[object]]s, the [[hom-set|hom-(∞,n-1)-category]] $C(X,Y)$ has adjoints for $(k-1)$-morphisms.

* $C$ **has adjoints** if it has adjoints for [[k-morphism]]s with $0 \lt k \lt n$.

If $C$ is in addition a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] we say that

* $C$ **has duals for objects** if its [[homotopy category]] is a [[rigid monoidal category]].

Finally we say that

* $C$ **has duals** if it has duals for objects and has adjoints.
