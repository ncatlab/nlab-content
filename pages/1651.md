## Definition

A [[topological space]] is called **locally path-connected** if it has a [[basis of the topology|basis]] of [[path-connected space|path-connected]] [[neighbourhoods]]. In other words, if for every point $x$ and [[neighbourhood]] $V \ni x$, there exists a path-connected neighbourhood $U \subset V$ that contains $x$.

###### Lemma

Let $X$ be a locally path connected space. Then the path connected component $P_x \subset X$ over any point $x \in X$ is an [[open set]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to show that every point $y \in P_x$ has an [[neighbourhood]] $U_y$ which is still contained in $P_x$. But by local path connectedness, $y$ has a neighbourhood $V_y$ which  is path connected. It follows by concatenation of paths that $V_y \subset P_x$.

A locally path-connected space is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if it is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]].

###### Proposition

The [[connected components]] of a locally path-connected space are the same as its path-connected components.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A path connected component is always connected ([this lemma](connected+space#ConnectedPathConnectedSpace)), and in a locally path-connected space is it also open (lemma \ref{InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen}).
This means that every path-connected component is also connected.


Conversely, it is now sufficient to see that every connected component is path-connected. Suppose it were not, then it would be covered by 
more than one disjoint non-empty path-connected components. 
But by lemma \ref{InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen} these
would be all open. This would be in contradiction with the assumption that 
$U$ is connected. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

###### Examples
**([[Euclidean space]] is locally path-connected)**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (with its [[metric topology]]) is locally path-connected, since each [[open ball]] is [[path-connected topological space]].

###### Example


Every [[open subset|open]] [[subspace]] of a locally path connected topological space is itself locally path connected.
