A space is **locally path-connected** if it has a basis of [[path-connected space|path-connected]] [[neighbourhood]]s. In other words, if for every point $x$ there exists a path-connected open set $U$ that contains $x$.

A locally path-connected space is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if it is path-connected.  In any case, the connected components of a locally path-connected space are the same as its path-connected components.

This is off the top of my head. Someone check it!

Yeah, it's right --- _Todd_.
