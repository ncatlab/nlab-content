## Definition

A [[topological space]] is called **locally path-connected** if it has a [[basis of the topology|basis]] of [[path-connected space|path-connected]] [[neighbourhoods]]. In other words, if for every point $x$ and [[neighbourhood]] $V \ni x$, there exists a path-connected neighbourhood $U \subset V$ that contains $x$.

## Properties

A locally path-connected space is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if it is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]].  In any case, the connected components of a locally path-connected space are the same as its path-connected components.
