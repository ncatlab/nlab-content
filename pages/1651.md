A space is **locally path-connected** if it has a basis of [[path-connected space|path-connected]] [[neighbourhood]]s. In other words, if for every point $x$ and neighbourhood $V \ni x$, there exists a path-connected neighbourhood $U \subset V$ that contains $x$.

A locally path-connected space is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if it is path-connected.  In any case, the connected components of a locally path-connected space are the same as its path-connected components.
