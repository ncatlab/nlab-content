## Idea

The notion of  _monomorphism_ is the generalization of the notion of _injective map of sets_ from the [[category]] [[Set]] to arbitrary [[category|categories]].

The [[formal duality|formally dual]] concept is that of _[[epimorphism]]_, which similarly generalizes (or strengthens) the concept of [[surjective function]].

Common jargon includes "is a mono" or "is monic" for "is a monomorphism", and "is an epi" or "is epic" for "is an epimorphism", and "is an iso" for "is an isomorphism".
 
## Definition

A [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in some [[category]] is called a _monomorphism_ (sometimes abbrieviated to _mono_, or described as being _monic_), if for every [[object]] $Z$ and every [[pair of parallel morphisms]] $g_1,g_2 \colon Z \to X$ then

$$
  \left(
    f \circ g_1
    \,=\,
    f \circ g_2
  \right)
  \;\Rightarrow \;
  \left(
    g_1 \,=\, g_2
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Stated more abstractly, this says that $f$ is a monomorphism if for every $Z$ the [[hom-functor]] $Hom(Z,-)$ takes it to an [[injective function]] between [[hom-sets]]

$$
  Hom(Z,X) 
    \overset{\phantom{AA} f_\ast \phantom{AA}}{\hookrightarrow} 
  Hom(Z,Y)
  \,.
$$

Since injective functions are precisely the monomorphisms in [[Set]] (example \ref{MonomorphismsInSet} below) this may be stated as saying that $f$ is a monomorphism if $Hom(Z,f)$ is a monomorphism for all objects $Z$. 

Finally, $f$ being a monomorphism in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ means equivalently that it is an [[epimorphism]] in the [[opposite category]] $\mathcal{C}^{op}$.

###### Example
**(monomorphisms in $Set$)

The monomorphisms in the category [[Set]] of [[sets]] and [[functions]] between them are precisely the [[injective functions]].

Every [[isomorphism]] is both a monomorphism and an [[epimorphism]].

### Examples of monos that are epi but not iso
 {#ExamplesOfMonosThatAreEpiButNotIso}

The following lists some examples of [[morphisms]] that are both [[monomorphisms]] and [[epimorphisms]], but not necessarily [[isomorphisms]].

\begin{example}

In the [[category]] of [[Hausdorff topological spaces]], the inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ of a [[dense subspace]] is an [[epimorphism]].

\end{example}

See [this Prop.](Hausdorff+space#DenseSubspaceInclusionsAreEpimorphismsAmongHausdorffSpaces) for proof.

\begin{example}
  
In [[unital ring|unital]] [[Rings]], the canonical inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \overset{i}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbb{Q}$ of the [[integers]] into the [[rational numbers]] is an [[epimorphism]].

\end{example}

See [this Prop.](Ring#InclusionOfIntegersIntoRationalsIsEpimorphismOfRings) for proof.


## Properties

We list the following properties without their (easy) proofs. The proofs can be found spelled out (dually) at [[epimorphism]].


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The following are equivalent:

* $f : x \to y$ is a monomorphism in $C$;

* $f$ is an [[epimorphism]] in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$;

* postcomposition with $f$ is a [[monomorphism]] in [[Set]]: that is, for all $c \in C$, $f \circ -: Hom(c,x) \to Hom(c,y)$ is an [[injection]];

* the [[commuting diagram]] 
  $$
    \array{
      x &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& x
      \\
      {}^{Id}\downarrow && \downarrow^{f}
     \\
     x &\underset{f}{\to}& y
    }
  $$

  is a [[pullback]] diagram.

###### Proposition

If $f \colon x \to y$ and $g \colon y \to z$ are monomorphisms, so is their composite $g f$.  If $g f$ is an monomorphism, so is $f$.

###### Proposition

Every [[equalizer]]

$$
  t \to x \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} y 
$$

is a monomorphism.

=--

The converse of the above proposition fails, and a mononomorphism that is the equalizer of some pair of morphisms is called a [[regular monomorphism]].

###### Proposition

Monomorphisms are preserved by [[pullback]].

###### Proposition

Monomorphisms are preserved by any [[right adjoint]] [[functor]], or more generally any functors that preserves pullbacks.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Monomorphisms are [[reflected limit|reflected]] by [[faithful functors]].

=--

We have seen some ways in which monomorphisms get along with limits.  Here is another:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Any morphism from a terminal  object is a monomorphism.  The product of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.
=--


Monomorphisms do not get along quite as well with colimits.  For example, the unique morphism from the initial object is not always an monomorphism, and the canonical morphisms from the summands into a coproduct, e.g. $i_1 : x_1 \to x_1 + x_2$, are not always monomorphisms (though these results do hold in $Set$). However, the unique morphism from the initial object is a monomorphism when the initial object is [[strict initial object|strict]], and the canonical morphisms into a coproduct are monomorphisms when the coproduct is a [[disjoint coproduct]]. 


## Variations

At [epimorphism](/nlab/show/epimorphism#Variations) there is a long list of variations on the concept of epimorphism.  Each of these, of course, has a dual notion for monomorphism, but the ones most commonly used are:

* [[split monomorphism]] = morphism which has a [[retraction]]
* [[normal monomorphism]] = a [[kernel]] of some morphism (in a category with [[zero morphisms]])
* [[regular monomorphism]] = an [[equalizer]] of some [[parallel pair]]
* [[strong monomorphism]] = a monomorphism [[orthogonality|right orthogonal]] to [[epimorphisms]]
* monomorphism

Frequently, regular and strong monos coincide.  For instance, this is the case in any [[quasitopos]], and also in [[Top]], where they are the subspace inclusions (the plain monomorphisms are the injective functions).

Sometimes, all monomorphisms are regular---this seems to happen a bit more frequently than for epimorphisms.  For instance, this is the case in any [[pretopos]] (including any [[topos]], such as [[Set]]), but also in any [[abelian category]], and also in the category [[Grp]].

In [[Ab]] and in any [[abelian category]], all monomorphisms are normal.  But this is not so in [[Grp]], where (despite the fact that all monomorphisms are regular), the normal monos are the inclusions of [[normal subgroups]] (hence the name).  In any [[Ab-enriched category]], all regular monos are normal, but not all monos need be regular.

In a [[Boolean topos]], such as [[Set]] (in [[classical mathematics]]), any monomorphism with [[inhabited set|inhabited]] domain is split.  Of course, no mono with empty domain and inhabited codomain can be split (in contrast to the dual case, where it can happen that all epimorphisms split -- the [[axiom of choice]]).
