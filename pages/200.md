#The category $Ring$ or rings#
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Definition

_Ring_ is the category of [[rings]] (with [[unital ring|unit]]) and ring [[homomorphisms]] (that preserve the unit).

A _ring_ is a [[monoid]] [[internalization|in]] [[Ab]], where $Ab$ is the category of [[abelian group|abelian groups]].  So, $Ring$ is an example of a category of [[internal monoids]].

## Properties

### Epi/Monomorphisms

Every [[surjective function|surjective]] [[homomorphism]] of rings is an [[epimorphism]] in $Ring$, but not every epimorphism is surjective. 

A counterexample is the defining inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ of the ring of [[integers]] into the ring of [[rational numbers]]. This is an injective epimorphism of rings.
