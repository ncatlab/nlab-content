Hi, I'm Hanno, a student from the University of Bonn. I am interested in algebraic topology, homological algebra, Lie theory and knot theory, though I do not know very much at any of these subjects. I hope to write my diploma thesis in 2010.

You can find my private homepage [here](http://www.uni-bonn.de/~habecker/mathe.xml). 

I hope to get some insights into higher category theory here and on the other hand to contribute to some topics which I am already familiar with.
