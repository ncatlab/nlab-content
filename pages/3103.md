Hi, I'm Hanno, a PhD student under supervision of Catharina Stroppel from the University of Bonn. I am interested in homological and homotopical algebra algebra, categorical logic, Lie theory and knot theory. My (hopefully) soon to be defended thesis is about applications of homotopy theoretic methods in Khovanov-Rozansky knot homology.

You can find my university homepage [here](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/habecker/). 

I hope to get some insights into higher category theory here and on the other hand to contribute to some topics which I am already familiar with.
