## Idea

In [[logic]], and more specifically in [[sequent calculus]]/[[natural deduction]], a **bunched logic** is a logic in which the formulas in the [[context]] are not just a [[list]] or [[set]] but have some additional, usually [[tree]]-like, structure.

This can be indicated syntactically by the use of two or more punctuation symbols, such as comma and semicolon, along with parentheses for grouping.  Thus for instance a sequent with bunches might be written like

$$ A,B,(C;(D,E);F),(G;H) \vdash K $$

The sub-contexts surrounded by parentheses are informally called *bunches*.  The phrase *bunched logic* is not entirely standard, although the word "bunches" has been used for multiple logics of this form.

Each type of punctuation also comes with a nullary version.  The punctuation symbols like comma and semicolon are sometimes called *structural connectives*, since they are part of the judgmental structure (like [[structural rules]]) but are closely related to the [[logical connectives]] such as conjunction and disjunction.

Usually the reason for using a bunched logic is that the bunches of different sorts obey different [[structural rules]].  For instance, the semicolon-bunches might allow the [[contraction rule]] and/or the [[weakening rule]], while the comma-bunches do not.

## Examples

### Bunched implications

In **bunched implications** logic ([BI](#BI)), the semicolon-bunches allow contraction and weakening while the comma-bunches do not.  This allows defining both an [[additive conjunction]] and a [[multiplicative conjunction]], internalizing the semicolon and the comma respectively, such that both [[distributive law|distribute]] over the [[additive disjunction]] and moreover both come with a corresponding implication: the [[additive implication]] and the [[multiplicative implication]].

### Relevance logic

Some forms of [[relevance logic]] can be presented with a bunched sequent calculus that is similar to BI, but in which the comma-bunches also have contraction (though not weakening) and there is no additive implication.  See for instance ([Mints](#Mints)).

## Categorical semantics

Bunched logics naturally have semantics in categories with more than one [[monoidal structure]], so that a bunch such as $(A,(B;C),((D,E);F))$ can be interpreted as $A \otimes (B\boxtimes C) \otimes ((D\otimes E)\boxtimes F)$.  Frequently (e.g. if one kind of bunch admits contraction and weakening) one of the two monoidal structures is a [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] one.  A typical and motivating example of a model for BI is the [[category of presheaves]] $[C^{op},Set]$ over a monoidal category $C$, which comes equipped both with the ordinary [[ccc structure on presheaves]] as well as the closed monoidal structure given by [[Day convolution]].
