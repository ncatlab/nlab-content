
For $V$ a [[vector space]] equipped with an [[inner product]] $\langle -,-\rangle : V \otimes V \to k$, a collection of vectors $\{v_i\}$ of $V$ is **orthogonal** with respect to $\langle -, - \rangle$ if for all $i \neq j$ we have $\langle v_i, v_j\rangle = 0$. It is __orthonormal__ if additionally we have $\langle{v_i, v_i}\rangle = 1$; that is, $\langle{v_i, v_j}\rangle = \delta_{i,j}$ (the [[Kronecker delta]]) for all $i, j$. Finally, we say that a collection of vectors is an orthogonal (or orthonormal) **basis** if it is a maximal set of [[basis of a free module|linearly independent]] vectors that is orthogonal (or orthonormal). 

The terminology is most widely applied in the context of a vector space over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex numbers]] that is equipped with a [[Euclidean space|positive definite inner product]], and even more especially in the context of [[Hilbert space]]. _Note that an orthonormal basis need not be a [[basis of a vector space|basis]]_ (cf. [[red herring principle]]), notably because for an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, it might not be a [[basis of a free module|spanning set]] in the ordinary algebraic sense. Instead, the [[subspace]] spanned by an orthonormal basis is a [[dense subspace]] with respect to the [[metric space]] [[topology]] defined by the positive definite inner product (and this is usually enough for the purposes of analysis).
