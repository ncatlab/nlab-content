## Definition

For $V$ an [[inner product space]], a collection of vectors $\{v_i\}$ of $V$ is **orthogonal** with respect to the inner $\langle{-, -}\rangle\colon V \times V \to k$ if for all $i \neq j$ we have $\langle{v_i, v_j}\rangle = 0$. It is __orthonormal__ if additionally we have $\langle{v_i, v_i}\rangle = 1$; that is, $\langle{v_i, v_j}\rangle = \delta_{i,j}$ (the [[Kronecker delta]]) for all $i, j$.  Note that an orthogonal set is necessarily [[linearly independent subset|linearly independent]].


## Bases

One often applies this to the case when the collection is a [[basis]] of the vector space.  Typically, by 'basis' here we mean the [[topological basis|sense of basis]] used for a [[topological vector space]] (which every positive-definite inner product space is naturally): a linearly independent set whose span is [[dense subspace|dense]] in $V$.  In the case where $V$ has finite [[dimension]], this matches the [[Hamel basis|purely algebraic sense of basis]]: a linearly independent set whose span is all of $V$, or equivalently a [[maximal element|maximal]] linearly independent set.

We have this interesting pair of results:

* On one hand, no infinite-dimensional positive-definite inner-product space has an orthogonal (much less orthonormal) basis in the purely algebraic sense.
* On the other hand, any maximal orthogonal set (which must exist by an application of [[Zorn's lemma]]) is necessarily a basis in the topological sense.


## Gram–Schmidt process

In the finite-dimensional case (at least), one may turn any basis into an orthogonal or even orthonormal basis using the [[Gram–Schmidt process]].
