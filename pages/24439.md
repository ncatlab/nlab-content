## Definition

In [[classical mathematics]], a multiplicatively cancellable [[rig]] is a rig $R$ such that each $(r \neq 0) \in R$ is multiplicatively cancellable.

An element $r \in R$ where $R$ is a rig is left multiplicatively cancellable iff for every $s,t \in R$ we have that $(r.s = r.t) \Rightarrow (s = t)$ and it is right multiplicatively cancellable iff for every $s,t \in R$ we have that $(s.r = t.r) \Rightarrow (s = t)$. An element $r \in R$ is multiplicatively cancellable iff it is left multiplicatively cancellable and right multiplicatively cancellable.

If $R$ is a commutative rig, an element is left multiplicatively cancellable iff it is right multiplicatively cancellable.

### In constructive mathematics

[[regular element of a commutative ring|Like in the case for integral domains]] and [[fields]], the definition above bifurcates into multiple definitions in [[constructive mathematics]].
