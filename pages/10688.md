## Idea

The _EHP spectral sequence_ is a [[spectral sequence]] for computation of [[homotopy groups of spheres]] obtained from the [[filtration]] of $\pi_{s+n}(S^n)$ by [[suspensions]] (German: _E_inh√§ngung):

$$
  \pi_{s+1}(S^1) \to \pi_{s+2}(S^2) \to \cdots \to \pi_{s+n}(S^n)
  \,.
$$


The EHP spectral sequence is often used used in the context of the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]] for [[p-localization]] at some prime $p$.
