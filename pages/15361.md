> {#WeStillHaveNo} We still have no fundamental formulation of “[[M-theory]]” - the hypothetical theory of which [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and the five [[string theories]] are all special limiting cases. Work on formulating the fundamental principles underlying M-theory has noticeably waned. $[...]$. If history is a good guide, then we should expect that anything as profound and far-reaching as a fully satisfactory formulation of M-theory is surely going to lead to new and novel mathematics. Regrettably, it is a problem the community seems to have put aside - temporarily. But, ultimately, Physical Mathematics must return to this grand issue.

> Perhaps we need to understand the nature of time itself better. $[...]$ One natural way to approach that question would be to understand in what sense time itself is an emergent concept, and one natural way to make sense of such a notion is to understand how pseudo-Riemannian geometry can emerge from more fundamental
and abstract notions such as categories of branes.
