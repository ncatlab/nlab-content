## Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], $E \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] and $D : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E)$ a [[differential operator]] on [[sections]] of $E$, its **symbol** is the bundle morphism

$$
   \sigma(D) : T^* X \times_X E \to E
$$

given at any point $x \in X$ on an cotangent vector being the restriction of a [[section]] $\mathbf{d}f \in \Gamma(T^* X)$ of the [[cotangent bundle]] being the [[de Rham differential]] of a [[smooth function]] by

$$
  \sigma(D)_x \colon \mathbf{d}f_x \mapsto [D,f]_x
  \,,
$$

where in the [[commutator]] on the right we regard multiplication by $f$ as an [[endomorphism]] of $\Gamma(E)$.

The symbol may naturally be thought of as an element in the [[K-theory]] of $X$ ([Freed](#Freed)).

## Examples

* For $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[Cartesian space]] and $D$ the [[Dirac operator]] of the [[flat connection]], the symbol of $D$ reproduces the [[symbol map]] between [[differential forms]] and [[Clifford algebra]] elements.
