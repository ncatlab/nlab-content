## Idea

The _Cahier topos_ is a [[cohesive topos]] that constitutes a [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|well-adapted model]] for [[synthetic differential geometry]] (a "[[smooth topos]]").

It is the [[sheaf topos]] on the [[site]] [[ThCartSp]] of [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimally thickened]] [[Cartesian spaces]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let [[ThCartSp]] be the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[smooth loci]] on those of the form 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \times \ell W
  \,,
$$

consisting of a [[product]] of a [[Cartesian space]] with an [[infinitesimally thickened point]], i.e. a formal dual of a _Weil algebra_ .

Dually, the [[opposite category]] is the [[full subcategory]] $ThCartSp^{op} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg$ of [[smooth algebras]] on those of the form

$$
  C^\infty( \mathbb{R}^k \times \ell W)
  = 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) \otimes W
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears for instance in [Kock Reyes (1)](#KockReyes).

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Define a structure of a [[site]] on [[ThCartSp]] by declaring a [[covering]] family to be a family of the form

$$
  \{
    U_i \times \ell W \stackrel{p_i \times Id}{\to} U \times \ell W
  \}
$$

where $\{U_i \stackrel{p_i}{\to} U\}$ is an [[open cover]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $U$ by Cartesian spaces $U_i$. 

=--

This appears as [Kock (5.1)](#Kock). 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


The **Cahiers topos** $\mathcal{CT}$ is the [[category of sheaves]] on this site:

$$
  \mathcal{CT} := Sh(ThCartSp)  
  \,.
$$

This site of definition appears in [Kock, Reyes](#KockReyes). The original definition is due to [Dubuc](#Dubuc)

## Properties

### Synthetic differential geometry

+-- {: .num_prop #ModelForSynthetic}
###### Proposition


The Cahiers topos is a well-adapted model for [[synthetic differential geometry]].

=--

This is due to [Dubuc](#Dubuc).

### Connectedness, locality and cohesion

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The Cahiers topos is a [[cohesive topos]]. See [[synthetic differential infinity-groupoid]] for details.

### Convenient vector spaces
 {#ConvenientVectorSpaces}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[category]] of [[convenient vector spaces]] with [[smooth functions]] between them embeds as a [[full subcategory]] into the Cahiers topos.

The embedding is given by sending a convenient vector space $V$ to the sheaf given by

$$
  V
  : 
  \mathbb{R}^k \times \ell W
  \mapsto 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k, V) \otimes W
  \,.
$$

=--

This result was announced in [Kock](#Kock). See the corrected proof in ([KockReyes](#KockReyes)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Together with prop. \ref{ModelForSynthetic}
this means that the [[differential geometry]] on
convenient vector spaces may be treated synthetically
in the Cahiers topos.

## Variants and generalizations

When restricting the [[site]] of infinitesimally thickened Cartesian spaces to that of plain [[Cartesian spaces]] one obtaines the topos discussed at _[[smooth space]]_. This is still a [[cohesive topos]], but no longer a model for [[synthetic differential geometry]].

The [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over $CartSp_{th}$ is disucssed at [[synthetic differential ∞-groupoid]]. It contains that Cahiers topos as the sub-[[(n,1)-topos|(1,1)-topos]] of [[0-truncated]] objects.
