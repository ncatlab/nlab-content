## Idea

The _Cahier topos_ is a [[smooth topos]] that constitutes a [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|well-adapted model]] for [[synthetic differential geometry]].

It is the [[sheaf topos]] on the [[site]] [[ThCartSp]] of [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimally thickened]] [[Cartesian space]]s.

## Definition

Let [[ThCartSp]] be the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[smooth loci]] on those of the form 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \times \ell W
  \,,
$$

consisting of a [[product]] of a [[Cartesian space]] with an [[infinitesimal space]], i.e. a formal dual of a _Weil algebra_ .

Define a structure of a [[site]] on [[ThCartSp]] by declaring a [[covering]] family to be a family of the form

$$
  \{
    U_i \times \ell W \stackrel{p_i \times Id}{\to} U \times \ell W
  \}
$$

where $\{U_i \stackrel{p_i}{\to} U\}$ is an [[open cover]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $U$ by Cartesian spaces $U_i$. 

The **Cahiers topos** $\mathcal{CT}$ is the [[category of sheaves]] on this site:

$$
  \mathcal{CT} := Sh(ThCartSp)  
  \,.
$$
