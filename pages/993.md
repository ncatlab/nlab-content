In [[geometry]], __spectrum__ is a geometric space constructed from some algebraic, categorical, analytic or similar data which typically do not have an obvious/manifest geometric meaning. Examples are [[Gelfand spectrum]] of a $C^*$-algebra, Grothendieck spectrum of a commutative ring, formal spectrum of a complete noetherian commutative ring, primitive spectrum of a noncommutative (but unital) ring, left spectrum of a noncommutative ring, Rosenberg's spectrum of an [[abelian category]], Gabriel's spectrum of indecomposable injectives, [[Pierce spectrum]], <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/09/18/berkovich-spaces-i">Bercovich spectrum</a> in rigid analytic geometry...

Spectrum does not necessarily give a faithful representation of original data. For example, Gelfand spectrum of a $C^*$-algebra is sufficient for reconstructing the $C^*$-algebra if we restrict to commutative $C^*$-algebras (Gelfand-Neimark [[reconstruction]] theorem), but is not a sufficient invariant if we consider all $C^*$-algebras. 

The word spectrum in this setup originates from the fact that the spectrum of a commutative Banach algebra is a natural extension of the theory of a spectrum of a family of commuting self-adjoint operators, which is in turn the generalization of the spectral theory of one self-adjoint operator. Spectrum of an operator is in quantum (and classical!) mechanics corresponding to frequencies of vibrations and waves, hence in optics to color. Newton experimentally observed the spectrum from white light passing through a prism, and with a surprise he considered it at first as a ghost like object, hence he named it after a Latin word for ghost or spirit (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum">wikipedia</a>).

Distinguish from [[spectrum]] in the sense of homotopy theory.
