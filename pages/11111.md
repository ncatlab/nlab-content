Serre's criterion of affiness characterizes [[affine morphism]]s of schemes in terms of exactness properties of the corresponding functors among the categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].

If $f\colon X\to Y$ is a [[quasicompact morphism]] of [[algebraic scheme]]s and $X$ is [[separated scheme|separated]], then $f$ is affine iff it is cohomologically affine, that is, the direct image functor $f_*$ is [[exact functor|exact]].
