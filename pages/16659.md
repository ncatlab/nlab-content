## Idea

The [[initial object]] in the category of toposes and [[logical morphisms]]; also known as the initial topos. This object is constructed out of the syntax of topos theory. 

### Foundations

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], [[Jim Lambek]] proposed to use the free topos as ambient world to do mathematics in; see ([Lambek 2001](#LambekWorld)). Being syntactically constructed, but universally determined, with higher-order [[intuitionistic type theory]] as [[internal language]] he saw it as a reconciliation of the three classical schools of [[philosophy of mathematics]], namely [[formalism]], [[platonism]], and [[intuitionism]]. His latest views on this variant of categorical foundations can be found in ([Lambek-Scott 2011](#LS11)).
