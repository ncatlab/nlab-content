## Definition

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]], a [[subset]] $S \hookrightarrow R$ of its set of elements is called _multiplicative_ if it is closed under multiplication "$\cdot$"in $R$, hence if $s_1,s_2 \in S \hookrightarrow R$ implies that $s_1 \cdot s_2 \in S \hookrightarrow R$.

The [[localization of a commutative ring]] at a multiplicative subset exists, denoted $S^{-1}R$ or $R[S^{-1}]$.
