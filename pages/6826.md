## Idea

Theories of [[supergravity]] always contain a global [[symmetry]] called [[R-symmetry]]. In some cases this is promoted to a local symmetry, such that there is a [[gauge field]] ([[connection on a bundle]]) with coefficients in that group. These are called _gauged supergravity_ theories.

## Properties

### From dimensional reduction

For many cases gauged supergravity theories are obtained by dimensional reduction from [[11-dimensional supergravity]] or [[type II supergravity]], which themselves do not contain a gauge field. This appears in the reduction by the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]].

## Examples

Some examples are discussed at [[7-dimensional supergravity]].
