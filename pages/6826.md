Theories of [[supergravity]] may contain a [[gauge field]] ([[connection on a bundle]]).

For many cases gauged supergravity theories are obtained by dimensional reduction from [[11-dimensional supergravity]] or [[type II supergravity]], which themselves do not contain a gauge field. This appears in the reduction by the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]].
