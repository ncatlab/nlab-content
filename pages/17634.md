## Definition
Let $V$ be a [[norm|normed]] [[vector space]]. A **unit vector** in $V$ is a vector with norm of 1. Given a non-zero vector $v \in V$, we can **normalize** it to a unit vector $\frac{v}{|v|}$ in the same direction.

## In quantum mechanics

Classically, the space of [[states]] of a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] system is given by a [[Hilbert space]] $H$. Often, it is desirable to consider only states of unit norm. One can view this as requiring that probabilities sum up to 1.
