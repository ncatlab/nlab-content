###### Definition

Let $C$ be a category with finite limits, let $\Grpd$ be the category of small groupoids.

A **groupoid object in** $C$ is defined to be a functor $F:C\to \Grpd$ such that

1. there is an object $g_0\in C_0$ such that there is a fuctorial identification $F(c)_0\simeq C(c,g_0)$

1. there is an object $g_1\in C_0$ such that there is a fuctorial identification $F(c)_1\simeq C(c,g_1)$

## Examples

A groupoid in $\Top$ is a [[topological groupoid]].

A groupoid in $\Diff$ is a [[Lie groupoid]].
