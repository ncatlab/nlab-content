Given a [[group]] $G$, its __lower central series__ is the inductively defined descending sequence

$$
G = G_0 \supset G_1\supset G_2\supset \ldots
$$

in which $G_k = [G, G_{k-1}]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ where $g\in G$ and $h\in G_{k-1}$. 

Similarly, given a Lie algebra $L$, its lower central series is the inductively defined descending sequence of Lie subalgebras $L = L_0\supset L_1\supset L_2\supset\ldots$ in which $L_k = [L, L_{k-1}]$ is the Lie subalgebra generated bt all commutators $[l,h]$ where $l\in L$ and $h\in L_{k-1}$.
