## Idea

For $G$ a [[compact topological group]], the notion of _$G$-CW-complex_ is much like that of [[CW-complex]], only that where in the latter case one builds a [[topological space]] from gluing of [[disks]] $D^n$ ("[[cell complex|cells]]") for a $G$-CW-complex one glues [[products]] of [[disks]] with $G$-[[orbits]] $G/H$ for suitable [[subgroups]] $H$.

These are spaces used in $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]].

## Properties

It seems that the collection of $G$-CW-complexes has a [[full sub-(infinity,1)-category|full embedding]] into the [[(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on the [[orbit category]] $Orb(G)$.
