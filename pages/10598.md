## Idea

The concept of _$G$-CW  complex_ is to that of [[CW-complexes]] as [[topological G-spaces]] are to [[topological spaces]]: for $G$ a [[compact topological group]], the notion of _$G$-CW-complex_ is much like that of [[CW-complex]], only that where in the latter case one builds a [[topological space]] from gluing of [[disks]] $D^n$ ("[[cell complex|cells]]") for a $G$-CW-complex one glues [[products]] of [[disks]] with $G$-[[orbits]] $G/H$ for suitable [[subgroups]] $H$.

These are spaces used in $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]].

## Properties

The collection of $G$-CW-complexes has a [[full sub-(infinity,1)-category|full embedding]] into the [[(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on the [[orbit category]] $Orb(G)$.  This is given by sending a $G$-CW complex, $Y$, to the presheaf sending $G/H$ to $Y^H$, the subspace of $Y$ fixed by $H$.

See at _[[Elmendorf's theorem]]_.
