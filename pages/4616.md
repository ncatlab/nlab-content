## Idea

A _nice simplicial topological space_ is a [[simplicial topological space]] that satisfies certain extra properties that make it well behaved in [[homotopy theory]], notably so that its [[geometric realization of simplicial spaces]] is its [[homotopy colimit]].

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn }
###### Definition 

Let $X : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ be a [[simplicial topological space]].

Such $X$ is called

* **good** if all the degeneracy maps $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n$ are all [[closed cofibration]]s;

* **proper** if the inclusion $s X_n \hookrightarrow X_n$ of the degenerate simplices is a [[closed cofibration]], where $s X_n = \bigcup_i s_i(X_{n-1})$.

In other words this says: $X_\bullet$ is proper if it is cofibrant in the [[Reedy model structure]] $[\Delta^{op}, Top_{Strom}]_{Reedy}$ on [[simplicial object]]s with respect to the [[Strøm model structure]] on [[Top]].

=--

The notion of good simplicial topological space goes back to ([Segal](#Segal)), that of proper simplicial topological space to ([May](#May)). 


## Properties

### General

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

A good simplicial topological space is proper.

=--

A proof appears as [Lewis, corollary 2.4 (b)](#Lewis). A generalization of this result is in [RobertsStevenson](#StevensonRoberts).


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X_\bullet$ any simplicial topological space, then ${|Sing X_\bullet|}$ is good, hence proper, and the natural morphism

$$
  {|Sing X_\bullet|} \to X_\bullet
$$

is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--

This follows by results in ([Lewis](#Lewis)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since for $X \in Top$ the map $|Sing X| \to X$ is a cofibrant [[resolution]] in the standard [[Quillen model structure on topological spaces]], we have that

$$
  |Sing X_\bullet| \to X_\bullet
$$

is a degreewise [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. In particular each space $|Sing X_n|$ is a [[CW-complex]], hence in particular a [[locally equi-connected space]]. By ([Lewis, p. 153](#Lewis)) inclusions of [[retract]]s of locally equi-connected spaces are [[closed cofibration]]s, and since degeneracy maps are retracts, this means that the degeneracy maps in $|Sing X_\bullet|$ are closed cofibrations.

### Models for the homotopy colimit

+-- {: .un_prop}

###### Proposition

Let $X_\bullet$ be a [[simplicial topological space]]. Then there is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[weak homotopy equivalence]] 

$$
 \Vert X_\bullet\Vert \simeq hocolim_{n \in \Delta} X_n
$$

from its fat [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]] to the [[homotopy colimit]] over the simplicial diagram $X : \Delta^{op} \to Top$.

If moreover $X_\bullet$ is [proper](#ProperSimplicialSpace), then the [[natural transformation|natural morphism]]  $ {\Vert X\Vert} \to {|X|}$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], and hence also the ordinary geometric realization is a model for the homotopy colimit.

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That the [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]] of a proper simplicial space is is homotopy colimit follows from the [above fact](#ProperIsReedyCofibrant) that proper spaces are Reedy cofibrant, and using the general statement discussed at [[homotopy colimit]] about description of homotopy colimits by [[coend]]s.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

In the case $X_\bullet$ that is a [good](#GoodSimplicialSpace) [[simplicial topological space]], a direct (i.e., not using the fact that goodness implies properness) proof that $ \Vert X\Vert  \to |X|$ is a weak homotopy equivalence has been sketched by [[Graeme Segal]] and then refined by Tammo tom Dieck.
