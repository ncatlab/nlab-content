## Idea

A _nice simplicial topological space_ is a [[simplicial topological space]] that satisfies certain extra properties that make it well behaved in [[homotopy theory]], notably so that its [[geometric realization of simplicial spaces]] is its [[homotopy colimit]].

## Definition

Let $X : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ be a [[simplicial topological space]].

Such $X$ is called

* **good** if all the degeneracy maps $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n$ are all closed cofibrations;

* **proper** if the inclusion $s X_n \hookrightarrow X_n$ of the degenerate simplices is a closed cofibration, where $s X_n = \bigcup_i s_i(X_{n-1})$.


## Properties

###### Proposition

A good simplicial space is also proper: $good \Rightarrow proper$.

This is apparently due to ([Lewis1982](#Lewis)).

###### Proposition

For $X_\bullet$ proper its [[geometric realization of a simplicial space]] is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to its [[homotopy colimit]] in the [[model structure on topological spaces]] over $\Delta$

$$
  |X_\bullet| \simeq hocolim_{n} X_n
  \,.

May originally said _strictly proper_ for what now is just called _proper_ .

The implication $good \Rightarrow proper$ seems to be handled like a folk theorem. Its origin is maybe in
