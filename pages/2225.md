Given a [[group]] $G$ and a subset $S\subset G$, the **normal closure** of $S$ in $G$ is the smallest [[subgroup]] containing the set of all conjugates of elements in $S$, i.e. the subgroup [[Moore closure|generated by]] the set of all elements of the form $g^{-1} s g$, where $g\in G$ and $s\in S$. The normal closure is clearly a [[normal subgroup]] of $G$. 

The normal closure, also called __conjugate closure__ (see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_closure)), should be distinguished from the [[normalizer]] of $S$ in $G$. In [[combinatorial group theory]] a group $G$ is [[presentation|presented]] via specifying a set $X$ of generators and a set $R$ of relations. This means that $G=F/N$ where $F$ is the [[free group]] generated by $X$ and $N$ is the normal closure of $R$ in $F$.
