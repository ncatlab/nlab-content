## Idea

In [[graph theory]], given an (undirected) [[graph]] the *graph distance* is, if it exists, the [[function]] that assigns to any [[subset]] of 2 [[vertices]] the [[length]] of the minimum path of edges between them, hence the [[minimum]] [[number]] of consecutive [[edges]] needed to connect the two vertices.

## Applications

### In geometric group theory

In [[geometric group theory]] the graph distance of the [[Cayley graph]] of a [[finitely generated group]] serves to equip with [[group]] with a [[metric]].
