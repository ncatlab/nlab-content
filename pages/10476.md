## Idea

_Elmendorf's theorem_  states that for $G$ a [[topological group]], then the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on the [[orbit category]] $Orb_G$ of $G$, naturally regarded as an [[(∞,1)-site]], is [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]] to the [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] of [[topological spaces]] with $G$-[[action]] ([[G-spaces]]) at the "fixed point weak equivalences" (also presented by [[G-CW complex]], see at _[[equivariant homotopy theory]]_ for more).

More in detail, for $G$ a [[topological group]], write $Top^G$ for the [[category]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] which are equipped with a [[continuous function|continuous]] $G$-[[action]]. Say that a [[continuous map]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between $G$-spaces is a **weak $G$-homotopy equivalence** if for any [[closed subspace|closed subgroup]] $H \hookrightarrow G$, the induced function on $H$-[[fixed point]] spaces $f^H \colon X^H \longrightarrow Y^H$ is an ordinary [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. Write 

$$
  Top^G[\{weak\,G-homotopy\;equivalences\}^{-1}]
  \in (\infty,1)Cat
$$

for the corresponding [[simplicial localization]].

Next, write $Orb_G$ for the [[full subcategory]] of $Top^G$ on the $G$-[[homogeneous spaces]] of the form $G/H$, but regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]] by regarding each hom-topological space as its [[homotopy type]]. Write moreover $Top^{Orb_G}$ for the category of [[continuous function|continuous]] functors $Orb_G^{op} \longrightarrow Top$. Write finally

$$
  PSh_\infty(Orb_G)
   \in 
 (\infty,1)Cat
  \,.
$$

Then Elmendorf's theorem asserts that there is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  Top^G[\{weak\;G-homotopy\;equivalences\}^{-1}]
  \simeq
  PSh_\infty(Orb_G)
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

In particular the theorem hence asserts that the $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]] is an [[(∞,1)-topos]].

###### Remark

There is an evident generalization of the [[orbit category]] of a fixed group to the [[global orbit category]]. Under this generalization an analog of Elmendorf's theorem plays a cental role in [[global equivariant homotopy theory]] ([Rezk 14](#Rezk14)).

## Model category presentation / Quillen equivalence
 {#ModelCategoryPresentation}

A version of the theorem that applies fairly generally for ([[discrete group|discrete]]) [[group objects]] in suitable [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] is in ([Guillou](#Guillou), [Stephan 13](#Stephan13)).

###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[cofibrantly generated model category]]
and for $G$ a [[discrete group]] (canonically regarded as a [[group object]] of $\mathcal{C}$ via its [[tensoring]] over [[Set]]) write $G \mathcal{C}$ for the category of $G$-[[actions]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

###### Example

Fixed point functors on the following kinds of model categories are cellular

* the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]];

* the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]];

* the global [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] over any small category;

* (...)

###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with cellular fixed point functor, def. \ref{CellularFixedPointFunctor}, then the category $G \mathcal{C}$ of $G$-actions in $\mathcal{C}$ carries a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] structure $G \mathcal{C}_{fine}$ whose weak equivalences and fibrations are those maps which induce weak equivalences or fibrations in $\mathcal{C}$, respectively, on objects of $H$-[[fixed points]], for all [[subgroups]] $H$ of $G$.

([Guillou, theorem 3.12](#Guillou))


Write $Orb_G$ for the [[orbit category]] of $G$.

Write $(\mathcal{C}^{Orb_G^{op}})_{proj}$ for the projective global [[model structure on functors]] from the $G$-[[orbit category]] to $\mathcal{C}$. 


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Proposition

There is a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  (\Theta, \Phi)
    \;\colon\;
  G\mathcal{C}
   \stackrel{\overset{\Theta}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\Phi}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{C}^{Orb_G^{op}}
$$

where $\Phi X \colon G/H \mapsto X^H$ assigns fixed-point objects and where $\Theta S$ has as underlying object $S(G/1)$.

This constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the above model structures

$$
  (\Theta, \Phi)
    \;\colon\;
  G\mathcal{C}_{fine}
    \simeq_{Quillen}
  \mathcal{C}^{Orb_G^{op}}_{proj}
 \,.
