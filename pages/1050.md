#Definition#

* A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **right exact** if for all [[object]]s $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $F/d$ is [[filtered category|filtrant]].

* A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **left exact** if for all [[object]]s $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $d/F$ is [[filtered category|filtrant]].

* A [[functor]] is **exact** if it is both left and right exact.

#Examples#

* If $C$ has finite [[limit]]s then a functor is left exact precisely if it preserves these limits.  See also [[continuous functor]].
