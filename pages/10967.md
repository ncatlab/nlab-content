## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] the _no-cloning theorem_ is the statement that one cannot produce a secod copy of an arbitrary given [[quantum state]] by a quantum physical process.

More on detai, it says that given a quantum systems with [[Hilbert spaces]] $H$ and with a chosen initial pure [[quantum state]] $e \in H$, then there is no [[unitary operator]] on the [[tensor product]] $H \otimes H$ which would take all states of the form $(\psi, e)$ to $(\psi,\psi)$. (This follows for instance immediately from the fact that such a unitary operator preserves, by definition, the [[inner product]].)

There is generalization of this to [[mixed quantum states]], then called the _no-broadcasting theorem_. Dually, there is also a _no-deleting theorem_.

Formally, when quantum physics is axiomatized by [[quantum logic]] in the guise of [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]], the content of "no-cloning" and "no-deleting" is the very "linearity" of this logic, the absence of a [[diagonal]] map and of a [[projection]] map for the non[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[tensor product]] in the [[categorical semantics]] given by non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[symmetric monoidal categories]].
