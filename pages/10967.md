## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] the _no-cloing theorem_ is the statement that one cannot produce two copies of an arbitrary given [[quantum state]].

Formally, when quantum physics is axiomatized by [[quantum logic]] in the guise of [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]], this is the very "linearity" of this logic, the absence of a [[diagonal]] map in the [[categorical semantics]] given by non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[symmetric monoidal categories]].
