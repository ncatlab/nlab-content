## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] the _no-cloning theorem_ is the statement that one cannot produce a secod copy of an arbitrary given [[quantum state]] by a quantum physical process.

More in detail, in its original version the statement is that given a quantum system with [[Hilbert space]] $H$ and with a chosen initial pure [[quantum state]] $e \in H$, then there is no [[unitary operator]] on the [[tensor product]] $H \otimes H$ which would take states of the form $(\psi, e)$ to $(\psi,\psi)$. 

Of course this cannot exist, because such a map would not even be [[linear map|linear]]. Often the statement is relaxed to observing that if there is a unitary that takes $(\psi,e)$ to $(\psi,\psi)$ and $(\phi,e)$ to $(\phi,\phi)$ for any two states $\phi,\psi \in H$, then either $\phi= \psi$ or $\phi \perp \psi$ (since it follows from unitarity that in this case $\langle\phi | \psi \rangle  = \langle\phi | \psi \rangle^2 $).

There is a  slightly more substantial generalization of this observation to [[mixed quantum states]], then called the _no-broadcasting theorem_. Dually, there is also a _no-deleting theorem_.

Formally, when quantum physics is axiomatized by [[quantum logic]] in the guise of [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]], the content of "no-cloning" and "no-deleting" is the very "linearity" of this logic, the absence of a [[diagonal]] map and of a [[projection]] map for the non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[tensor product]] in the [[categorical semantics]] given by non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[symmetric monoidal categories]] such as that of Hilbert spaces. See also at _[[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]]_.

From this perspective one gets a more interesting statement if one turns this around and asks which conditions are imposed on a [[symmetric monoidal category]] if its [[tensor product]] is assumed to admit a [[diagonal map]] (for "cloning") or [[projection]] maps (for "deleting") or both. These turn out to be very strong conditions. For instance in order for a [[diagonal]] to exist for the tensor product of a [[compact closed category]] implies that every [[endomorphism]] on every [[object]] in the category is a multiple of the [[identity]] ([Abramsky 09](#Abramsky09), in generalization of "[Joyal's lemma](dualizing+object+in+a+closed+category#InACartesianClosedCategory)"). This is clearly false in any category in which one could find interesting quantum mechanics, certainly in that of (finite dimensional) [[Hilbert spaces]].
