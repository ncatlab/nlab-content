A **subsingleton** generally refers to a [[subset]] (of some ambient set $A$) having at most one element.  That is, it is a subset $B$ of $A$ such that any two elements of $B$ are equal.

Of course, classically any subsingleton is either [[empty set|empty]] or a [[singleton]], but [[constructive mathematics|constructively]] this need not hold.  In a [[topos]], the "object of subsingletons in $A$" is the [[partial map classifier]] for $A$, often denoted $A_\bot$.

###### Remark

Sometimes a slightly different convention is used: There what we call subsingletons are called **[[subterminal object|subterminals]]**, and a subset $B$ of $A$ is a *subsingleton* if and only if there exists an element $a \in A$ such that every element of $B$ is equal to $a$. With this nomenclature, any subsingleton is a subterminal, but the converse doesn't hold in general. (See _[[flabby sheaf]]_ for a class of examples where the converse does hold.)
