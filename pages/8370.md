## Idea

Under the identifications

1. [[propositions as types]]

1. [[programs as proofs]]

1. [[relation between type theory and category theory]]

the following notions are equivalent:

1. The [[proof]] of a [[proposition]]. (In [[logic]].)

1. A [[program]] with output some [[type]]. 

1. A [[morphism]] between [[objects]]. (In [[category theory]].)

This is referred to as "computational trinitarianism" in ([Harper](#Harper)), where also an exposition is given.

>The central dogma of computational trinitarianism holds that Logic, Languages, and Categories are but three manifestations of one divine notion of computation.  There is no preferred route to enlightenment: each aspect provides insights that comprise the experience of computation in our lives.

>Computational trinitarianism entails that any concept arising in one aspect should have meaning from the perspective of the other two.  If you arrive at an insight that has importance for logic, languages, and categories, then you may feel sure that you have elucidated an essential concept of computation--you have made an enduring scientific discovery.
