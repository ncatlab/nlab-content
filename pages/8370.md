## Idea

Under the identifications

1. [[propositions as types]]

1. [[programs as proofs]]

1. [[relation between type theory and category theory]]

the following notions are equivalent:

1. The [[proof]] of a [[proposition]]. (In [[logic]].)

1. A [[program]] with output some [[type]]. 

1. A [[morphism]] between [[objects]]. (In [[category theory]].)

This is referred to as "computational trinitarianism" in ([Harper](#Harper)), where also an exposition is given.
