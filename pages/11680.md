## Idea

As the concept of _[[coherent sheaf]]_ is a generalization of that of ([[complex vector bundle|complex]], [[algebraic vector bundle]]) [[vector bundle]], the concept of _rank_ of a coherent sheaf is the corresponding generalization of that of _[[rank of a vector bundle]]_.

## Definition

e.g. ([Huybrechts-Lehn 96, def. 1.2.2](#HuybrechtsLehn96))

## Related concepts

* [[degree of a coherent sheaf]]

* [[slope of a coherent sheaf]]

* [[stable coherent sheaf]], [[Bridgeland stability condition]]

This appeared in the Grothendieck's FGA in order to treat the moduli problems leading to [[Quot scheme]]s. See Nitsure's contribution at [[FGA explained]] for a modern remake.
