## Idea

Notions of [[cohesion - table|cohesion]] are generally treated with [[∞Grpd]] as the [[base (∞,1)-topos]]. However, for the purposes of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[arithmetic geometry]], the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-topos of (∞,1)-sheaves]] over the [[pro-étale site]] of a point, $Sh_\infty(ProFinSet)$, may be better suited.

Since this site is used centrally in [[condensed mathematics]], we might call cohesion over this new base, _condensed cohesion_. On the other hand, it is the closed related [[pyknotic set|pyknotic]] approach that constructs an (∞,1)-topos of pyknotic spaces.


## Infinitesimal cohesion

The [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] of $Sh_\infty(ProFinSet)$ ought to be composed of parameterized condensed [[spectra]]. (Pyknotic spectra are treated in ([BarHai19, sec 3.1](#BarHai19).)

## Cohesion

The big pro-étale site on all schemes over a separably closed field $k$ is (check) cohesive over the pro-étale site of a point. 

Consider then [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos -- structures]].

The [[differential cohomology diagram]] for stable objects in sheaves over the former...
