## Idea 

A _gauge theory_ may denote either a [[classical field theory]] or a [[quantum field theory]] whose [[field configurations]] are [[cocycles]] in [[differential cohomology]] ([[ordinary differential cohomology|abelian]] or [[Chern-Weil theory|nonabelian]]).

### Ordinary gauge theories

An _ordinary gauge theory_ is a [[quantum field theory]] whose field configurations are [[vector bundle]]s 
[[connection on a bundle|with connection]].

This includes notable the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the [[standard model of particle physics]]:

* Ordinary [[electromagnetism]] in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]. 

* Fields in [[Yang-Mills theory]] (such as appearing in the [[standard model of particle physics]] and in [[GUT]]s) are [[vector bundle]]s [[connection on a bundle|with connection]].

Other examples include formal physical models.

* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is a gauge theory whose field configurations are $G$-[[principal bundle]]s for $G$ a finite group (these come with a unique [[connection on a bundle|connection]], so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group $G$ in these examples is called the [[gauge group]] of the theory.

### Higher and generalized gauge theories 

The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-$1$ [[differential cohomology]].

More generally, a _[[higher gauge theory]]_ is a [[quantum field 
theory]] whose field configurations are cocycles in more general [[differential cohomology]], for instance higher degree [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycles]] or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential [[K-theory]].

This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

* The [[magnetic current]] in [[electromagnetism]] is a [[bundle gerbe|bundle gerbe with connection]], a [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] refining a cocycle in degree-$3$ [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology]]: the _magnetic charge_ .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher [[supergravity]] theories,

* The [[Kalb-Ramond field]] is a [[bundle gerbe|bundle gerbe with connection]], a [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] with curvature 3-form.

* The [[supergravity C-field]] is a [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] with curvature 4-form.

* The [[RR-field]] is a cocycle in [[differential K-theory]].


### Gravity as a gauge theory

There are various models that realize gravity also as a gauge theory.

* [Chern-Simons Actions for (Super)-Gravities](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/03/chernsimons_actions_for_superg.html)

In particular [[supergravity]] theories have interpretations as higher gauge theories as described at [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]].

## Properties

### Non-redundancy and locality

Sometimes one see the view expressed that [[gauge symmetry]] is "just a redundancy" in the description of a [[theory (physics)|theory of physics]], for instance in that among [[observables]] it is only the [[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]] ones which are physically meaningful.

This statement however

### Anomalies 

In the presence of [[magnetic charge]] (and then even in the absence of [[chiral fermion anomaly|chiral fermion anomalies]]) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] is a famous phenomenon in [[differential cohomology]] by which such a [[quantum anomaly]] cancels against that given by chiral fermions.

## List of gauge fields and their models

The following tries to give an overview of some collection of gauge fields in physics, their models by [[differential cohomology]] and further details.

* [[Yang-Mills field]]

  * cocycle in lowest degree [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|nonabelian differential cohomology]]  

    * originally realized in terms of differential [[Čech cohomology|Čech cocycle]]s
      $$
        \hat F \in \mathbf{H}(X, \bar \mathbf{B} G)
      $$
      with coefficients in the [[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms]],
       
      then traditionally in terms of [[vector bundle]]s [[connection on a bundle|with connection]]

  * [[field strength]] depending on the [[group]] $G$ we have
  
    * $G = U(1)$ - [[electromagnetism]] (see below)

    * $G = SU(2)\times U(1)$ - electroweak force field strength

    * $G = SU(3)$ - strong nuclear force field

  * [[parallel transport]]: [[Wilson line]]s

* [[electromagnetic field]]

  * cocycle in degree-$2$ [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|ordinary]] [[differential cohomology]]

    * naturally/historically realized in terms of Maxwell-Dirac presentation as a cocycle in [[Čech cohomology|Čech]]--[[Deligne cohomology|Deligne]] cocycle
      $$
        \hat F \in \mathbf{H}(X,\bar \mathbf{B} U(1))
      $$

  * [[field strength]]: the electric field $E$ and magnetic field $B$, locally at a point $x \in X$
    $$
      F = E \wedge d t + \star_3 B 
    $$

  * on $X = \mathbb{R}^3\backslash \{0\}$: underlying class in integral cohomology $cl(\hat F) \in H(X,\mathbf{B} U(1)) \simeq H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is the [[magnetic charge]]

  * [[parallel transport]]: gauge interaction piece of [[path integral|action functional]] of the electrically charged quantum 1-particle


* [[Kalb-Ramond field]]

  * cocycle in degree-$3$ [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|ordinary]] [[differential cohomology]]

    * naturally/historically realized in terms of 

      * a cocycle in [[Čech cohomology|Čech]]--[[Deligne cohomology|Deligne]] cocycle

        $$
          \hat H \in \mathbf{H}(X,\bar \mathbf{B}^2 U(1))
        $$

      * a [[bundle gerbe]] with connection

  * [[field strength]]: $H \in \Omega^3(X)$ the "$H$-field" -- on a D-[[brane]] this is the [[magnetic current]] for the  [[Yang-Mills field]] on the [[brane]]

  * [[parallel transport]]: gauge interaction piece of [[path integral|action functional]] of the electrically charged quantum 2-particle (the [[string theory|string]]).


* [[supergravity C-field]]

  * cocycle in degree-$4$ [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|ordinary]] [[differential cohomology]]

    * naturally/historically realized in terms of as a cocycle in [[Čech cohomology|Čech]]--[[Deligne cohomology|Deligne]] cocycle
      $$
        \hat H \in \mathbf{H}(X,\bar \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
      $$

      using the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] it may also be thought of as a [[schreiber:theory of differential nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian differential cocycle]] given by a [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection]]

  * [[field strength]]: $H \in \Omega^4(X)$ the "$G$-field" -- in heterotic [[supergravity]] this is the 5-brane [[magnetic current]] for the  [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[Kalb-Ramond field]]
 
  * [[parallel transport]]: gauge interaction piece of [[path integral|action functional]] of the electrically charged quantum 3-particle (the [[brane|membrane]]).


* [[RR field]]

  * cocycle in [[differential K-theory]]

    * in presence of nontrivial [[Kalb-Ramond field]]: cocycle in differential [[twisted K-theory]]

  * [[field strength]]: RR-forms

  > The manuscript of Weyl’s first book on mathematical physics, Space – Time – Matter (STM) (Raum – Zeit – Materie), delivered to the publishing house (Springer) Easter 1918, did not contain Weyl’s new geometry and proposal for a UFT. It was prepared from the lecture notes of a course given in the Summer semester of 1917 at the Polytechnical Institute (ETH) Zürich. Weyl included his recent findings only in the 3rd edition (1919) of the book. The English and French versions (Weyl 1922b, Weyl 1922a), translated from the fourth revised edition (1921), contained a short exposition of Weyl’s generalized metric and the idea for a scale gauge theory of electromagnetism.
