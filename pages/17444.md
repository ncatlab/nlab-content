##Idea

A **bi-Heyting topos** is a [[topos]] whose lattices of subobjects carry the structure of a [[co-Heyting algebra]] in addition to their normal [[Heyting algebra]] structure and thereby permit to model co-intuitionistic logic.

##Definition

A [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ such that the lattice $sub(X)$ of subobjects is a [[co-Heyting algebra|bi-Heyting algebra]] for every object $X\in\mathcal{E}$ is called a [[bi-Heyting topos]].

## Examples

* [[essential subtoposes|Essential subtoposes]] of presheaf toposes.

##Properties

##Remark

* In bi-Heyting toposes the co-Heyting algebra operations are generally not preserved by [[inverse image functor|inverse image functors]], so that the co-Heyting logical operators like [[co-Heyting negation]] or [[co-Heyting boundary]] are subject to _[[de re and de dicto]]_ effects.
