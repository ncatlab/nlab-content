##Idea

A **bi-Heyting topos** is a [[topos]] whose lattices of subobjects carry the structure of a [[co-Heyting algebra]] in addition to their normal [[Heyting algebra]] structure and thereby permit to model bi-intuitionistic logic.

##Definition

A [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ such that the lattice $sub(X)$ of subobjects is a [[co-Heyting algebra|bi-Heyting algebra]] for every object $X\in\mathcal{E}$ is called a [[bi-Heyting topos]].

## Examples

* [[Boolean toposes]] are bi-Heyting since their subobject lattices are Boolean algebras which are self-dual Heyting algebras.

* Presheaf toposes and their [[essential subtoposes]].

##Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
A Grothendieck topos is bi-Heyting when finite unions distribute over arbitrary intersections:
$$
S\cup (\bigcap_{i\in I} T_i)=\bigcap_{i\in I} (S\cup T_i)\quad .
$$
=--

**Proof.** Because this distributivity amounts to the preservation of limits by $T\vee$\_ and implies by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] the existence of a left adjoint \_$\backslash T$ which provides the [[co-Heyting algebra]] structure. $\qed$

###### Proposition
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a Grothendieck topos with generating set $\{G_i | i\in I\}$. Then $\mathcal{E}$ is bi- Heyting precisely iff the lattice of subobjects of $G_i$ is a bi-Heyting algebra for all $G_i$.

###### Proposition
Let $f:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{F}$ be a surjective [[essential geometric morphism]] between Grothendieck toposes. If $\mathcal{E}$ is bi-Heyting so is $\mathcal{F}$.

###### Proposition
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category. Then $Set^{\mathcal{C}^{op}}$ is bi-Heyting.
=--

**Proof.**  Let $|\mathcal{C}|$ be the discrete category on the objects of $\mathcal{C}$. The inclusion $i:|\mathcal{C}|\hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ induces a surjective essential geometric morphism $Set^{|\mathcal{C}|^{op}}\to Set^{\mathcal{C}^{op}}$ and the first of these is Booelan hence bi-Heyting. By prop. \ref{surjective_essential} follows the claim. $\qed$


##Remark

* In bi-Heyting toposes the co-Heyting algebra operations are generally not preserved by [[inverse image functor|inverse image functors]], so that the co-Heyting logical operators like [[co-Heyting negation]] or [[co-Heyting boundary]] are subject to _[[de re and de dicto]]_ effects.
