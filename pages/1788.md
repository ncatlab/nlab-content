**Traditional approach.** Notice that what is considered in [DMW00](#DMW00), [DFM03](#DFM03) and elsewhere to quantize the C-field flux $G_4$ is not just ordinary cohomology, but ordinary cohomology with bells and whistles added as need be:

Foremost there is the half-integral quantization of the $G_4$-flux, mentioned as (3.2) in [DMW00](#DMW00). Ordinary cohomology may be modified ("shifted")  to accomodate this, as maybe first formalized in [HS02](#HS02) and used in [DFM03](#DFM03). 

Beyond this, [DMW00](#DMW00) argue that the "M-theory path integral" imposes a further condition on the shifted integral cohomology class of $G_4$, namely that it be in the kernel of the Steenrod operation $Sq^3$. Whether this constraint is enforced by flux quantization in some further modification of ordinary cohomology is not discussed there.

Instead, the observation made is that the constraint $Sq^3 [F_4] = 0$ is also the first condition that appears in the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for lifting an ordinary cohomology class $[F_4]$ to complex topological K-theory, as demanded by the widely accepted conjecture that RR-field fluxes $F_{n}$ in string theory are quantized in topological K-theory. 

Since, moreover, $F_4$ is meant to come from $G_4$ as one lifts string theory to M-theory, the observation of [DMW00](#DMW00) is hence that the "integral equation of motion" in M-theory reproduces one of the constraints on one of the RR-field components given by flux quantization in K-theory. 

Suggestive as this is, this consistency check is arguably not a "derivation of K-theory" in string theory. In fact, the conjecture that string theoretic RR-flux really is quantized in K-theory remains itself being debated (for instance, it's not clear how to make it compatible with S-duality). The problem here is that little is known with certainty about non-perturbative string theory beyond a web of interlocking conjectures.

\linebreak

{#InViewOfThisSituation} **Hypothesis H.** In view of this situation it seems worthwhile to try a strict top-down approach where a unified generalized cohomology theory in M-theory is postulated and its consequences on flux quantization rigorously derived. 

There are good hints what this M-theoretic cohomology theory ought to be: Its image in rational cohomology must see the trivialization of the cup square of the $G_4$-flux demanded by 11d supergravity -- this being the M-theoretic lift of the twisted Bianchi identities that motivate the twisted K-theory conjecture [MSa 03, Sec. 4.2](#MSa03), [FSS 16, Sec. 3](#FSS16).  The condition happens to be exactly the relation that identifies the Sullivan model of the 4-sphere, thus suggesting that M-brane charge is quantized in 4-Cohomotopy theory; due to [Sa 13, Sec. 2.5](#Sa13).

Indeed, cohomotopical charge quantization in M-theory, on the rational level, follows from a first-principles analysis of the super $p$-brane scan, and is as such the direct M-theoretic analogue of a computation that derives the twisted K-theory classification of D-brane charge ([FSS 15](#FSS15), reviewed in [FSS19a, Sec. 7](#FSS19a)).

This means that any cohomology theory which quantizes M-brane charge should rationally coincide with Cohomotopy theory. Accordingly, it is natural to consider the hypothesis (dubbed "[[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]") that M-brane charge indeed is in Cohomotopy theory itself [Sa 13](#Sa13)  (suitably twisted by the tangent bundle [FSS19b](#FSS19b), [FSS19c](#FSS19b)).

\linebreak

**Implications.** Indeed, one finds that the assumption of [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]], that M-brane charge is in J-twisted Cohomotopy theory, readily implies both the half-integral shifted flux quantization on $G_4$ as well as the "integral equation of motion" -- together with a list of further expected constraints [FSS19b, Table 1](#FSS19b). 

This way [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] implies as much "derivation of K-theory"; though one should push further to an actual derivation of the implied flux quantization of RR-fields. Derivation from [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] of more of the fine-print in the K-theory conjecture is in [SS19a](#SS19a), [BSS18](#BSS18), [BMSS 18](#BMSS18).

Moreover, Hypothesis H sees the Horava-Witten Green-Schwarz mechanism in the presence of M5-branes ([FSS19d](#FSS19d), [SS20b](#SS20b)), reveals fine-print in the M5-brane anomaly cancellation argument ([SS20a](#SS20a)), and seems to see a zoo of subtle brane charge effects expected in Hanany-Witten systems ([SS19b](#SS19b)). Certainly none of these effects follows from flux quantization in just ordinary cohomology (nor in K-theory, for that matter).

By way of outlook, we think we see now that there is a natural chromatic character map on twisted Cohomotopy which exhibits the M5-brane partition function as charge-quantized in elliptic cohomology, as suggested by traditional discussion of M5-brane ellitptic genera. This is work in progress.

\linebreak

{#Conclusion} **Conclusion.** In summary, rigorous derivation of the implications of [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] suggests that twisted Cohomotopy theory sees a fair number of subtle effects that have previously been argued informally to appear in the elusive non-perturbative completion of string theory. This may be indication that, going beyond the traditional approach of hard-coding M-theoretic folklore into a putative "C-field model", charge quantization in twisted Cohomotopy might get to the native heart of the elusive mathematical nature of "M-theory". But, of course, more analysis is necessary.

The very first paragraphs of the reply highlight that subquotients of ordinary cohomology groups are not ordinary cohomology anymore --  or else you'd conclude from the AHSS that everything is ordinary cohomology. There is a single flux quantization condition enforced by ordinary integral cohomology, namely integrality of the charge, and evidently that's not the subtle web of conditions in question here. If C-field flux were quantized in ordinary cohomology, there'd be no need for DFM to discuss "models of the C-field", namely candidate non-ordinary cohomology theories whose structure enforces the peculiar nature of C-field flux. From plain ordinary cohomology in 11d evidently K-theory does not follow, or else the latter were pointless. Ordinary cohomology quantizes non-interacting abelian gauge flux and nothing else, that does't make an M-theory. It's extra conditions on top of superficially ordinary cohomology classes which are the content of DMW's old argument, as explained in the reply's first section. 

One needs to understand, as readers venturing into this discussion might be expected to know, that the Chern-Dold character map and the AHSS are tools to break down any generalized cohomology into ordinary cohomology with a sequence of conditions and identifications imposed on them. It is in this way, and only in this way, that, conversely, an intricate web of flux quantization conditions on superficially ordinary cohomllogy classes may be unified and be explained by making manifest a single but generalized cohomology theory which enforces them all. It is this nature of flux quantization in generalized cohomology which is the point, cause and aim of the discussion. The reader unclear about this would need to be provided with more explanation of the background story, not less.
