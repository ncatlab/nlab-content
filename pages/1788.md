> Sandbox rules appear to be:
 Do not touch an existing section.
Sections are made with a sizeable number of #-symbols juxtaposed.
You may make new sections, though, on the top of the section-`stack'.
Finally, erase what you have entered once you do not need it anymore (the content is allowed to linger for quite some time though, no rush).

### test: does ascii art work the same way as in [nforum](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/7794/strictification-of-isofibrations-up-to-homotopy/?Focus=63233#Comment_63233)?

(THIS TEST CAN BE DELETED)

To make the software here display ASCII art verbatim you need to indent the relevant lines by (at least) four whitespaces

      X >-~-> X_1
      |       |
     A|       v
      v       v

    X >-~-> X_1
    |       |
   A|       v
    v       v
