Notice that what is considered in [DMW00](#DMW00), [DFM03](#DFM03) and elsewhere to quantize the C-field flux $G_4$ is not just ordinary cohomology, but ordinary cohomology with bells and whistles added as need be:

Foremost there is the half-integral quantization of the $G_4$-flux, mentioned as (3.2) in [DMW00](#DMW00). Ordinary cohomology may be modified ("shifted")  to accomodate this, as maybe first formalized in [HS02](#HS02) and used in [DFM03](#DFM03). 

Beyond this, [DMW00](#DMW00) argue that the "M-theory path integral" imposes a further condition on the shifted integral cohomology class of $G_4$, namely that it be in the kernel of the Steenrod operation $Sq^3$. Whether this constraint is enforced by flux quantization in some further modification of ordinary cohomology is not discussed there.

Instead, the observation made is that the constraint $Sq^3 [F_4] = 0$ is also the first condition that appears in the Atyizah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for lifting an ordinary cohomology class $[F_4]$ to complex topological K-theory, as demanded by the widely accepted conjecture that RR-field fluxes $F_{n}$ in string theory are quantized in topological K-theory. 

Since, moreover, $F_4$ is meant to come from $G_4$ as one lifts string theory to M-theory, the observation of [DMW00](#DMW00) is hence that the "integral equation of motion" in M-theory reproduces one of the constraints on one of the RR-field components given by flux quantization in K-theory. 

Suggestive as this is, this consistency check is arguably not a "derivation of K-theory" in string theory. In fact, the conjecture that string theoretic RR-flux really is quantized in K-theory remains itself being debated (for instance, it's not clear how to make it compatible with S-duality). The problem here is that little is known with certainty about non-perturbative string theory beyond a web of interlocking conjectures.

In view of this situation it seems worthwhile to try a strict top-down approach where a unified generalized cohomology theory in M-theory is postulated and its consequences on flux quantization rigorously derived. 

Interestingly, the assumption of [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]], that M-brane charge is in J-twisted Cohomotopy theory, readily implies both the half-integral shifted flux quantization on $G_4$ as well as the "integral equation of motion" (together with a list of further expected constraints, [FSS19b](#FSS19b), [FSS19c](#FSS19b)). 

This way it implies as much "derivation of K-theory"; though one should push further to an actual derivation of the implied flux quantization of RR-fields. Further comparison of Hypothesis H to the K-theory conjecture is in [SS19a](#SS19b) [BSS18](#BSS18), now in the sector of fractional D-brane charge at orbifold singularities.  

Moreover, Hypothesis H seems to see a zoo of subtle brane charge effects expected in Hanany-Witten systems ([SS19b](#SS19b)). Certainly none of these effects follows from flux quantization in just ordinary cohomology.
