###### Definition

###### Example
**(wave front set of [[delta distribution]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the [[delta distribution]]

$$
  \delta(0) \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

on $n$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]], given by [[evaluation]] at the origin. Its wave front set is

$$
  WF(\delta(0))
  = 
  \left\{
    (0,k)
    \;\vert\;
    k \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\}
  \right\}
  \subset
  \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n
  \simeq
  T^\ast \mathbb{R}^n 
  \,.
$$

###### Proof

First of all the [[singular support of a distribution|singular support]] of $\delta(0)$ is clearly $singsupp(\delta(0)) = \{0\}$, hence the wave front set vanishes over $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\}$. 

At the origin, any bump function $b$ supported around the origin with $b(0) = 1$ satisfies $b \cdot \delta(0) = \delta(0)$ and hence the wave front set over the origin is the set of covectors along which the [[Fourier transform of distributions|Fourier transform]] $\hat \delta(0)$ does not suitably decay. But this Fourier transform is in fact a [[constant function]] and hence does not decay in any direction.

###### Example
**(wave front set of [[Heaviside distribution]])**

Let $H \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^1)$ be the [[Heaviside distribution]] given by

$$
  \langle H, b\rangle \coloneqq \int_0^\infty b(x)\, d x
  \,.
$$

Its wave front set is

$$
  WF(H) = \{(0,k) \vert k \neq 0\}
  \,.
