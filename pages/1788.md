
## Quantum circuits via dependent linear types

The following indicates how quantum protocols in [[quantum information theory]] -- hence  [[quantum circuits]] consisting of general [[quantum gates]] with classical control, including [[decoherence|de-coherent]] [[quantum measurement]]-gates -- are naturally formulated in [[dependent linear type theory]], with classically controlled [[quantum states]] regarded as having [[linear type|linear data types]] [[dependent type|dependent]] on the classical control parameters and measurement results. The key observation is that:

1. The [[necessity]] [[modality]] $\Box_C \coloneqq (p_C)^\ast (p_C)_\ast$ on [[linear types]] dependent on a given classical [[context]] $C$ (which includes classical control parameters as well as eventual [[quantum measurement]]-outcomes on the same footing) knows all about controlled [[quantum gates]]: These are identified with the [[morphisms]] in its [[co-Kleisli category]], with the $\Box_C$-[[counit of a comonad|counit]] (taking a linear type "out of the comonad") reflecting the operation of [[quantum measurement]] (and the [[comultiplication]] encoding the [[superposition]]-principle).

1. The [[external tensor product]] of dependent linear types gives the compilation of [[quantum gates]] into [[quantum circuits]], essentially as familiar from the quantum [[string diagram]]-calculus of [Abramsky & Coecke 2004](finite+quantum+mechanics+in+terms+of+dagger-compact+categories#AbramskyCoecke04) with respect to the plain [[tensor product]], but now taking into account all classical control and all potential measurement outcomes. 

All this flows readily from the abstract theory, the only extra observation involved is that the necessity modality respects the external tensor product -- and hence that these classically controlled quantum circuits are unambiguously defined --, which follows when the [[modality]] of *[[necessity]]* $\Box_C \mathscr{H}_\bullet$ coincides with that of *[[possibility]]* $\bigcirc_C \mathscr{H}_C$ on the quantum data types $\mathbb{H}_\bullet$ involved -- hence (in full generality) when the linear types are [[dualizable object|dualiable]] in the sense of [[ambidextrous adjunction|ambidextrous]] and specifically (in the traditional model) when [[space of quantum states|quantum state spaces]] are [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]], as usual in [[quantum information theory]].

In summary, the following shows that every [[dependent linear type theory|dependent linearly-typed]] [[programming language]] as in [Riley 2022](dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22Thesis) *automatically* is a [[quantum programming language]] for classically controlled [[quantum circuits]] (as such somewhat akin to [[Quipper]] but entirely avoiding Quipper's problem of needing "dynamical lifting" of "bits back into the context"). 

### General

We assume a [[dependent linear type theory]] which [[functor|functorially]] obtains (as anticipated in [Schreiber 2014](dependent+linear+type+theory#Schreiber14), [§3.2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.7041.pdf#page=39) and established in [Riley 2022](dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22Thesis), [§2.4](https://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/islandora/object/ir:3269)):

1. from a classical ("intuitionistic") [[type]] $X : Type$ a (large) type $LinType_X$ of [[linear types]] [[dependent type|dependent]] on $X$, equipped with [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal structure]] $(-) \otimes (-)$ ([[tensor product]]) and $[-,\,-]$ ([[internal hom]]);

1. from a [[function]] $f : X_1 \xrightarrow{\;} X_2$ between classical types a [[yoga of six operations]] (specifically: a "[[Wirthmüller context]]") between their types of dependent linear types, hence a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[substitution]]/[[pullback]] operation $f^\ast$ which is [[strong monoidal functor|strong monoidal]], [[strong closed functor|strong closed]] and extends to a [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]] (with [[left adjoint]] $f_!$ a version of [[dependent sum]] and [[right adjoint]] a version of [[dependent product]]):
