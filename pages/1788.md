###### Remark

Since, by definition \ref{CWSpectrum}, a $p$-cell of a [[cell spectrum]] that appears at stage $q$ shows up as its $k$-fold suspension at stage $q+k$, its attachment to some spectrum $X$ is reflected by a [[pushout]] of spectra of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma^\infty S^{-1}_+[-q]
      &\longrightarrow&
    X
      &\longrightarrow&
    \ast
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty i_{p}[-q]}}
    \downarrow
      &(po)&
    \downarrow
      &(po)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma^\infty D^{p}_+[-q]
      &\longrightarrow&
    \hat X
      &\longrightarrow&
    \Sigma^\infty S^p[-q]
  }
  \,,
$$ 

where the left vertical morphism is the image under the $-q$th shift spectrum functor (def. \ref{ShiftedSpectrum}) of the image under the [[suspension spectrum]] functor (def. \ref{SuspensionSpectrum}) of the basic cell inclusion $i_p$ of [[pointed topological spaces]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#GeneratingCofibrationsForPointedTopologicalSpaces)). This is a cofibration by prop. \ref{SigmaInfinityIsQuillenOnStrictModelStructureOnSequential}, and so also the middle vertical morphism is a cofibration, by theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}. Using the [[pasting law]] for pushout, we find that the [[cofiber]] of the middle vertical morphisms (hence its [[homotopy cofiber]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyFiber)) in the strict model structure) is \Sigma^\infty S^p[-q]$ (and not $\Sigma^\infty S^p_+[-q]$!). This is a shift of a trunction of the [[sphere spectrum]].

After having set up the stable model category structure in theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory} below, we find that this means that cell attachments to CW-spectra in the stable model structure are by cofibers of integer shifts of the sphere spectrum.
