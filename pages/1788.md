

I have a suspicion: 

a flow

$$
  Jet(F) \stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow} Jet(F)
$$

being evolutionary is to mean that it preserves the Cartan distribution, and by what I just said in #5, but dualizing back through the $(T_{inf} \dashv Jet)$-adjunction, I am guessing now that this means that its image under $i_\ast$ stabilizes the universal differential operator, i.e. that we have

$$
  \array{
    && Jet( F)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{}}\swarrow &\swArrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    Jet(Jet(F))
    && \underset{Jet(\phi)}{\longrightarrow}&&
    Jet(Jet(F))
  }
  \,.
$$

If that is true, then my second order conjecture is that the horizontal $\eta$ are those killed by this precomposition, i.e. that for a quantomorphism

$$
  \array{
       Jet(F) && \stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow} && Jet(F)
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\mathbf{L}}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\mathrlap{\eta}}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{L}}}
       \\
       && \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn}
   }
$$

to be admissible, we need

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    && Jet( F)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{}}\swarrow &\swArrow& \searrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\       
       Jet(Jet(F))  && \stackrel{Jet(\phi)}{\longrightarrow} && Jet(Jet(F))
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{Jet \mathbf{L}}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\mathrlap{Jet(\eta)}}& \swarrow_{ \mathrlap{Jet\mathbf{L}}}
       \\
       && Jet \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn}
   }
   \right)
   \;\;\;\;
    \simeq
   \;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    && Jet F
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\       
       Jet(Jet(F))  && = && Jet(Jet(F))
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{Jet \mathbf{L}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{Jet \mathbf{L}}}
       \\
       && Jet \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn}
   }
  \right)
$$
