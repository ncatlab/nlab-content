Let $E \in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ be an [[Omega-spectrum]] (def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum}) and let $X\in Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ be a [[pointed topological space]] with $\Sigma^\inft X$ its [[suspension spectrum]] (example \ref{SuspensionSpectrum}). Then the [[graded abelian group]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet(X)
     & \coloneqq
    [\Sigma^\infty X, \Sigma^\bullet E]
    \\
      & \simeq
    [X, \Omega^\infty \Sigma^\bullet E]_\ast
    \\
      & \simeq
    [X, E_\bullet]_\ast
  \end{aligned}
$$

is also called the [[reduced chomology]] of $X$ in the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory that is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by $E$.

Here the equivalence used are

1. the [[adjunction]] isomorphism of $(\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty)$ from theorem \ref{StableHomotopyCategoryIsIndeedStabilizationOfClassicalHomotopyCategory};

1. the isomorphism $\Sigma \simeq [1]$ of suspension with the shift spectrum (def. \ref{ShiftedSpectrum}) on $Ho(Spectra)$ of lemma \ref{CounitOfFakeSuspensionAndShiftIsStableEquivalence}, together with the nature of $\Omega^\infty$ from prop. \ref{SigmaInfinityOmegaInfinity}.

The latter expression 

$$
  \tilde E^n(X) \simeq [X, E_n]_\ast
$$

(on the right the hom in in the [[classical homotopy category]] $Ho(Top^{\ast/})$ of [[pointed topological spaces]]) is manifestly the definition of [[reduced cohomology|reduced]] [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] as discussed in [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- S|part S]] in the [section on the Brown representability theorem](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory -- S#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem).

More generally, there is now $E$-cohomology not only for spaces, but also for spectra: for $X \in Ho(Spectra)$ be any spectrum, then

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
   \coloneqq
  [X,\Sigma^\bullet E]
$$

is called the reduced $E$-cohomology of the spectrum $X$. For examples see in the [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- S|part S]] the section _[Orientation in generalized cohomology](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#OrientationAndFiberIntegration)_.
