First let $\hat X_0 \longrightarrow X_0$ be a CW-approximation of the component space in degree 0, via prop. \ref{CWApproximationForContinuousFunctions}. Then proceed by [[induction]]: suppose that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[CW-approximation]] $\phi_{k \leq n} \colon  \hat X_{k \leq n} \to X_{k \leq n}$ has been found such that all the structure maps are respected. Consider then the continuous function

$$
  S^1 \wedge \hat X_n 
    \overset{S^1 \wedge \phi_n}{\longrightarrow} 
  S^1 \wedge X_n 
    \overset{\sigma_n}{\longrightarrow} 
  X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

Applying prop. \ref{CWApproximationForContinuousFunctions} to this function factors it as

$$
  S^1 \wedge \hat X_n 
    \hookrightarrow 
  \hat X_{n+1} 
    \overset{\phi_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow} 
  X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

Hence we have obtained the next stage of the CW-approximation. The respect for the structure maps is just this factorization property:

$$
  \array{  
    S^1 \wedge \hat X_n 
      &\overset{S^1 \wedge \phi_n}{\longrightarrow}& 
    S^1 \wedge X_n
    \\
    {}^{incl}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n}}
    \\
    \hat X_{n+1} &\underset{\phi_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$
