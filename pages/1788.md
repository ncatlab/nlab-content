###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}. Write $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are those objects of $\mathcal{C}$ which are both fibrant and cofibrant;

* [[morphisms]] are the [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, hence the [[equivalence classes]] of morphism under the equivalence relation of prop. \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations}.

and whose [[composition]] operation is given on representatives by composition in $\mathcal{C}$.

This is, up to [[equivalence of categories]], the **[[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category of the model category]]** $\mathcal{C}$.

###### Proposition

Def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} is well defined, in that composition of morphisms between fibrant-cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ indeed passes to [[homotopy classes]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Fix any morphism $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$ between fibrant-cofibrant objects. Then for precomposition

$$
 (-) \circ [f] \;\colon\; Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(Y,Z) \to Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C}(X,Z))}
$$

to be well defined, we need that with $(g\sim h)\colon Y \to Z$ also $(f g \sim f h)\colon X \to Z$. But by prop \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations} we may take the homotopy $\sim$ to be exhibited by a right homotopy $\eta \colon Y \to Path(Z)$, for which case the statement is evident from this diagram:

$$
  \array{
    && && Z
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow & \uparrow^{\mathrlap{p_1}}
    \\
    X 
      &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow} & 
    Y
      &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path(Z)
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{g}}\searrow & \downarrow_{\mathrlap{p_0}}
    \\
    && && Z
  }
  \,.
$$

For postcomposition we may choose to exhibit homotopy by left homotopy and argue dually.
