Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a stable cofibration that is also a stable weak homotopy equivalence, and let $g \colon X \to X'$ be any morphism. Consider the [[pushout]] diagram 

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y &\longrightarrow& cof(f)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow 
       &(po)& 
     \downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X' &\underset{g_\ast f}{\longrightarrow}& Y' &\longrightarrow& cof(g_\ast f)
  }
  \,.
$$

The induced map on [[cofibers]] on the right is an isomorphism by the [[pasting law]]. Since $f$ is a cofibration, so is its pushout $g_\ast f$ (by the model structure), and hence both these cofibers are actually [[homotopy cofibers]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyFiber)). Hence by prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfStableHomotopyGroups} there is a diagram of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     \pi_{\bullet+1}(cof(f))
     &\longrightarrow&
     \pi_\bullet(X) &\overset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(Y) &\longrightarrow& \pi_\bullet(cof(f))
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow 
       && 
     {}^{\mathllap{g_\ast}}\downarrow 
       && 
     \downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     \pi_{\bullet+1}(cof(g_\ast f))
     &\longrightarrow&
     \pi_\bullet(X') &\underset{(g_\ast f)_\ast}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(Y') &\longrightarrow& \pi_\bullet(cof(g_\ast f))
  }
$$

where both horizontal sequences are exact. That $f$ is a stable weak homotopy equivalence means precisely that $f_\ast$ is an isomorphism, and hence exactness of the top sequence implies that $\pi_\bullet(cof(f)) = 0$. Then the isomorphisms on the right and left imply that also $\pi_\bullet(cof(g_\ast f)) = 0$ and so exactness of the bottom sequence implies that $(g_\ast f)_\ast$ is an isomorphism, hence that the pushout $g_\ast f$ is a stable weak homotopy equivalence.
