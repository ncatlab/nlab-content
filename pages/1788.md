In order to see this, it is convenient to adopt the following notation: for $f \colon X \to Y$ a morphism, then we denote the collection of [[generalized element]] of its homotopy fiber as

$$
  hofib(f)
  = 
  \left\{
    (x, f(x) \rightsquigarrow \ast)
  \right\}
$$

indicating that these elements are pairs consisting of an element $x$ of $X$ and a "path" (an element of the given path space object) from $f(x)$ to the basepoint.
