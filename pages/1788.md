###### Remark
**(covering spaces are [[Serre fibrations]] but not in general [[Hurewicz fibrations]])**

Since the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] $n$-disks $D^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are evidently locally connected, prop. \ref{HomotopyLiftingPropertyOfCoveringSpaces} says in particular that covering spaces have the [[right lifting property]] against the set of inclusions


$$
  \left\{
    D^n \overset{(id, const_0)}{\hookrightarrow} D^n \times [0,1]
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

A continuous function with the right lifting property against this set of functions is called a _[[Serre fibration]]_.

On the other hand, a continuous function with the right lifting property against the inclusions $X \overset{(id_X, const_0)}{\hookrightarrow} X \times [0,1]$ for _all_ topological spaces $X$ is called a _[[Hurewicz fibration]]_.

Not every covering space is a Hurewicz fibration, for counterexamples see [this example](Serre+fibration#SerreFibrationsWhichAreNotHurewiczFibrations).

However, if we restrict all topological spaces involved to [[compactly generated topological spaces|compactly generated]] [[weakly Hausdorff topological spaces]] (one of the [[convenient categories of topological spaces]] that one often restricts attention to) then every covering space both whose base space as well as whose total space admits is the structure of a [[CW-complex]] is a Hurewicz fibration ([this prop.](Serre+fibration#SerreFibrationsBetweenCWComplexesAreHurewiczFibrations)).
