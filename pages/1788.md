###### Proposition

In the [[projective model structure on functors|projective model structures]] on [[cotowers]] in topological spaces, $[\mathbb{N}^{\leq}, (Top_{cg})_{Quillen}]_{proj}$ and $[\mathbb{N}^{\leq}, (Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}]_{proj}$ from def. \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnNSequencesOfTopologicalSpaces}, the following holds:

1. The [[colimit]] functor preserves fibrations between sequences of [[relative cell complex]] inclusions;

1. Let $I$ be a [[finite category]], let $D_\bullet(-) \colon I \to [\mathbb{N}^{\leq}, Top_{cg}]$ be a finite [[diagram]] of sequences of relative cell complexes. Then there is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

Use that both $(Top_{cg})_{Quillen}$ and $(Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}$ are [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] (theorem \ref{CofibrantGenerationOfPointedTopologicalSpaces}) whose generating acyclic cofibrations have [[compact topological spaces]] as [[domains]] and [[codomains]]. The colimit over a sequence of relative cell complexes (being a [[transfinite composition]]) yields another [[relative cell complex]], and hence lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} says that every morphism out of the domain or codomain of a generating acyclic cofibration into this colimit factors through a finite stage inclusion. Since a projective fibration is a degreewise fibration, we have the [[lifting property]] at that finite stage, and hence also the lifting property against the morphisms of colimits.

Regarding the second statement:

This is a model category theoretic version of a standard fact of plain [[category theory]], which says that in the category [[Set]] of sets,[filtered colimits commute with finite limits](commutativity+of+limits+and+colimits#FilteredColimitsCommuteWithFiniteLimits) in that there is an isomorphism of sets of the form which we have to prove is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces. But now using that weak homotopy equivalences are detected by forming [[homotopy groups]] (def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}), hence [[hom-sets]] out of [[n-spheres]], and since $n$-[[spheres]] are [[compact topological spaces]], lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} says that homming out of $n$-spheres commutes over the colimits in question. Moreover, generally homming out of anything commutes over [[limits]], in particular [[finite limits]] (every [[hom functor]] is [[left exact functor]] in the second variable). Therefore we find isomorphisms of the form

$$
  Hom\left(
    S^q,
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
      \left(
        \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
        D_n(i)
      \right)
  \right)
  \simeq
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
      \left(
        \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
        Hom\left(S^q, D_n(i)\right)
      \right) 
   \overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
      \left(
        \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
        Hom\left(S^q D_n(i)\right)
      \right) 
   \simeq
    Hom\left(
     S^q,
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i
      \left(
        \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n}
          D_n(i)
      \right) 
   \right)
$$

and similarly for the [[left homotopies]] $Hom(S^q \times I,-)$ (and similarly for the pointed case). This implies the claimed isomorphism on homotopy groups.
