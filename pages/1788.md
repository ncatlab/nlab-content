###### Lemma

For $X \in Ho(Spectra)$ any spectrum in the [[stable homotopy category]] (remark \ref{StableHomotopyCategoryStructuredSpectra}), then the derived [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] (corollary \ref{MonoidalStableHomotopyCategory}) 

$$
  X \wedge^L (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Ho(Spectra)
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(Spectra)
$$

preserves [[homotopy cofiber sequences]].

###### Proof

We may choose a cofibrant representative of $X$ in $OrthSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable}$, which we denote by the same symbol. Then by theorem \ref{StableModelStructureWithSymmetricMonoidalSmashProductSatisfiesPushoutProductAxiom} 

$$
  X \wedge (-) \;\colon\; OrthSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable} \longrightarrow OrthSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable}_{stable}
$$

is a left Quillen functor in that it preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations (and it is a [[left adjoint]] by prop. \ref{MonoidalCategoryOfModules}. Hence its [[left derived functor]] is equivalently its restriction to cofibrant objects followed by the localization functor.

But now every [[homotopy cofiber]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyFiber)) is represented by the ordinary [[cofiber]] of a cofibration. The left Quillen functor preserves both the cofibration as well as its cofiber.
