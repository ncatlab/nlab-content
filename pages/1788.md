## Where should tags for text elements appear. Start or end?

This started off as "do tags on elements of a sub list work?"

{#pgh} Here is a paragraph starting with the tag `pgh`.

See [this paragraph](#pgh).

from [[quasitopos]] 

* The following examples are categories of separated presheaves for the $\neg\neg$-topology on various presheaf toposes: 

  * {#inj} The category of [[monomorphisms]] between sets (as presheaves on the [[interval category]]).  

  * {#endorel} The category of sets equipped with a [[relation]] (as presheaves on 
    $$G_1 = (0 \stackrel{\overset{s}{\to}}{\underset{t}{\to}} 1),$$ 
    a truncation of the [[globular category]]).  

  * {#endoref} The category of sets equipped with a reflexive relation (as presheaves on a truncated reflexive globular category). 

  * {#endosym} The category of sets equipped with a symmetric relation (as presheaves on the full subcategory of finite sets and injections consisting of just the objects $1$, $2$). 

  * {#endorefsym} The category of sets equipped with a reflexive symmetric relation (as presheaves on the full subcategory of finite sets consisting of just the objects $1$, $2$). See [[category of simple graphs]]. 

* {#born} The category of [[bornological set|bornological sets]].

* The tag at the end of this list item doesn't make it into the HTML. {#atend} 

* removing the space before the tag doesn't help.{#atend2}

----

Tag [at end](#atend) of text preceded by a space doesn't work. 

Spaceless tag [at end](#atend2) doesn't work.

All of these work (with the tag at the start):

* [$Inj$](#inj), [$EndoRel$](#endorel), [$EndoSym$](#endosym), [$EndoRef$](#endoref), [$EndoRefSym$](#endorefsym).

-----

Strangely single bracket link texts allow math expressions while double bracket texts don't. For example

    the topos [$Set^\to$](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sierpinski+topos) or[$Set^\to$](nlab/show/Sierpinski+topos) or [[Sierpinski topos|$Set^\to$]]. 

produces

+-- {: .standout}
the topos [$Set^\to$](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sierpinski+topos) or[$Set^\to$](nlab/show/Sierpinski+topos) or [[Sierpinski topos|$Set^\to$]].

## heading1 with tag at end works.{#head1}

link to [heading1](#head1).

## {#head2}heading2 with tag at start. The tag doesn't make it into HTML.

link to [heading2](#head2).
