## Idea

A *photonic crystal* ([Benisty et a. 1999](#BenistyEtAl99), going back to [Yablonovitch 1987](#Yablonovitch87), [John 1987](#John87)) (often: a *waveguide array*) is a material with periodic dielectric structure/refractive index in which [[light waves]] (ultimately: [[photons]]) behave much like [[Bloch waves]] of [[electrons]] inside an actual [[crystal]], such as in that they form [[energy bands]] separated by band gaps ([Yablonovitch 1987](#Yablonovitch87)). (Of course, the underlying material may itself be made form actual [[crystal|crystalline]] structures, such as [[graphene]], see e.g. [BBKKL10](#BBKKL10)).

By suitably engineering photonic crystals they may emulate various phenomena seen elsewhere in nature (for instance transport properties analogous to those in [[semiconductors]]) or not seen anywhere else, whence one also speaks of "[[metamaterial|meta-materials]]". 

For instance, many aspects of [[topological phases of matter]] ([[topological insulators]], [[semimetals]], ...) have analogs realizations in photonic crystals ("topological photonics", see the references [below](#ReferencesTopologicalPhotonics)). Notably  [[braiding]] of [[band nodes]] has been demonstrated in [[photonic semimetals]] ([Park, Gao, Zhang & Oh 2022](#ParkGaoZhangOh22)) and similarly for [[phonon|phonons]] ([Peng, Bouhon, Monserrat & Slager 2022](#PBMS22)).
