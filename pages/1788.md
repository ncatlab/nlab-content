###### Lemma

For $X, Y \in \mathcal{C}$ with $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, and for $P, Q$ fibrant/cofibrant replacement functors as in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, then the morphism

$$
 Hom_{Ho(\mathcal{C})}(P X,Q Y)
  =
 Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Q Y)/_{\sim}
   \overset{Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(j_X, p_Y)}{\longrightarrow}
 Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_{\sim}
$$

(on [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms, well defined by prop. \ref{BetweenCofibFibLeftAndRightHomotopyAreEquivalentEquivalenceRelations}) is a [[natural bijection]].

###### Proof

We may factor the morphism in question as the composite

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Q Y)/_{\sim}
    \overset{Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_{P X}, p_Y)/_\sim }{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Y)/_{\sim}
    \overset{Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(j_X, id_Y)/_\sim}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_{\sim}
  \,.
$$

This shows that it is sufficient to see that for $X$ cofibrant and $Y$ fibrant, then 

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)/_\sim
   \;\colon\; 
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Q Y)/_\sim \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_\sim
$$

is an isomorphism, and dually that

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(j_X, id_Y)/_\sim 
  \;\colon\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(P X, Y)/_\sim \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/_\sim
$$

is an isomorphism. We discuss this for the former; the second is [[formal dual|formally dual]]:

First, that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)$ is surjective is the [[lifting property]] in 

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\longrightarrow& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_Y}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which says that any morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ comes from a morphism $\hat f \colon X \to Q Y$ under postcomposition with $Q Y \overset{p_Y}{\to} Y$.

Second, that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(id_X, p_Y)$ is injective is the lifting property in 

$$
  \array{
    X \sqcup X &\overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_Y}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(X) &\underset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

which says that if two morphisms $f, g \colon X \to Q Y$ become homotopic after postcomposition with $p_Y \colon Q X \to Y$, then they were already homotopic before.
