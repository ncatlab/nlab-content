We give a summary of the central steps of motivic quantization of local prequantum field theory in general abstract terms of (or akin to) [[homotopy type theory]], hence in the [[internal language]] of [[(∞,1)-toposes]]. This is to bring out the sheer conceptual simplicity underlying the process.

1. Choose a [[homotopy type theory]] $\mathbf{H}$ with [[differential cohesion|differential]] [[cohesion]], hence equipped with [[higher modalities]]  $(\Pi \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ ([[shape modality]], [[flat modality]], [[sharp modality]]) and $(Red \dashv \Pi_{inf} \dashv \flat_{ingf})$ ([[reduction modality]], [[infinitesimal shape modality]], [[infinitesimal flat modality]]). 

   We say that $\mathbf{H}$ is a context for [[local prequantum field theory]].

1. To choose a _[[phase and phase space in physics|group of phases]]_ is to choose an [[abelian ∞-group]] $\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$.

   By [[differential cohesion]] this choice induces a a [[type]]
   $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}$ of $\mathbb{G}$-[[principal ∞-connections]].

   The [[context]] of such a choice, hence the the [[slice (∞,1)-topos|slice homotopy theory]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}}$, is the context of [[local action functional]] assigning [[phase and phase space in physics|phases]] in $\mathbb{G}$ within the ambient context of local prequantum field theory. 

   A [[type]] in this [[context]] is such a [[local action functional]] $\left[\array{\mathbf{Fields} \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exp(i S)}} \\ \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn} }  \right]$, its [[dependent sum]] to the ambient context is the [[moduli ∞-stack]] of [[field (physics)|fields]].

   Moreover, the [[automorphism ∞-groups]] of [[types]] in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}}_{conn}$ are the [[quantomorphism ∞-groups]] containing the [[Heisenberg ∞-groups]], whose [[Lie differentiation]] are the [[Poisson L-∞ algebras]] and [[Heisenberg L-∞ algebras]] of the local prequantum field theory, respectively.

1. To choose a _[[superposition principle]]_ is to choose an 
   [[E-∞ ring|commutative ring]] type $E \in CRing_\infty(\mathbf{H})$ and a [[function]] $\rho \colon \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}GL_1(E)$ to its [[∞-group of units]].

   Given a superposition principle, the [[dependent sum]] of a
   [[local action functional]] $\exp(i S)$ along $\rho$ we call the
   [[higher prequantum line bundle|higher prequantum E-line bundle]].

   A [[section]] of the [[higher prequantum line bundle]] is called a [[wavefunction]] and forming the [[space of sections]] is an  [[(∞,1)-functor]]  $E^{\bullet + (-)}(-) \colon \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL_1(E)} \longrightarrow E Mod$ to $E$-[[∞-modules]].

1. A [[relation]] in the local prequantum field theory context
   $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}}$ we call a 
   [[space]] of [[trajectories]]. Its [[dependent sum]]
   along $\rho$ we call the corresponding [[integral kernel]].
   The image of that under $\Gamma$ we call maybe by the same name.
   A choice of self-[[dual object|duality]] on its correspondence $E$-module
   we call a [[path integral]] [[measure]]. This induces
   a [[linear function]] by passing to [[dual morphisms]] and this is the
   [[quantum propagator]] given by [[quantization]] of the original
   space of [[trajectories]].
