


The [[wave front set]] of the various [[propagators]] for the [[Klein-Gordon equation]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]], regarded, via [[translation]] [[invariant|invariance]], as [[distributions]] in a single variable, are as follows:

* the [[causal propagator]] $\Delta_S$

  $$
     WF(\Delta_S) = \left\{ (x,k) \,\vert\, {\vert x\vert}^2_\eta = 0 \,\text{and}\, {\vert k\vert}^2_\eta = 0 \, \text{and} \, k \neq 0  \right\}
  $$

* the [[Hadamard propagator]] $\Delta_H$


  $$
    WF(\Delta_H) = \left\{ (x,k) \,\vert\, {\vert x\vert}^2_\eta = 0 \,\text{and}\, {\vert k\vert}^2_\eta = 0 \,\text{and}\, k_0 \gt 1   \right\}
  $$
