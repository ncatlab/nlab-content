We claim that from its components on consecutive spheres the functor $X$ is already uniquely determined. Indeed, by definition the hom-space between non-consecutive spheres $StdSpheres(S^n, S^{n+k})$ is the 
[[smash product]] of the hom-spaces between the consecutive spheres, for instance:

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge S^1 & = & StdSpheres(S^n, S^{n+1}) \wedge StdSpheres(S^{n+1}, S^{n+2})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow 
      && 
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow^{\circ}
    \\
    S^2 & = & StdSpheres(S^n , S^{n+2})
  }
  \,,
$$

and so functoriality completely fixes the former by the latter.

Now observe that a [[natural transformation]] $f \colon X \to Y$ between two functors on $StdSpheres$ is equivalently a collection of component maps $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$, such that for each $s \in S^1$ then the following squares commute

$$
  \array{
    X(S^n) 
      &\overset{f_n}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y^{S^{n}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{X_{S^n,S^{n+1}}(s)}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y_{S^n,S^{n+1}}(s)}}
    \\
    X(S^{n+1})
      &underset{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y(S^{n+1})
  }
  \,,
$$

By the smash/hom adjunction, the square equivalently factors as

$$
  \array{
    X(S^n) 
      &\overset{f_n}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y^{S^{n}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(s,id)}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(s,id)}}
    \\
    S^1 \wedge X(S^n)
     &\underset{id \times f_n}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^1 \wedge Y(S^n)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\sigma^X_n}}
    \downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^Y_n}}
    \\
    X(S^{n+1})
      &underset{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y(S^{n+1})
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the top square commutes in any case, and so the total rectangle commutes precisely if the lower square commutes, hence if under our identification the components $\{f_n\}$ constitute a homomorphism of sequential spectra.
