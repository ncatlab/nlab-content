###### Remark

Given a [[vector bundle]] $V \to X$ of [[rank]] $n$, then the [[reduced cohomology|reduced]] [[ordinary cohomology]] of its [[Thom space]] $Th(V)$ (def. \ref{ThomSpace}) vanishes in degrees $\lt n$:

$$
 \tilde H^{\bullet \lt n}(Th(V))
  \simeq
  H^{\bullet \lt n}(D(V), S(V))
  \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

###### Proof

Consider the [[long exact sequence]] of [[relative cohomology]] ([here](generalized+cohomology#ExactnessUnreduced))

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  H^{\bullet-1}(D(V))
   \overset{i^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{\bullet-1}(S(V))
   \longrightarrow
  H^\bullet(D(V), S(V))
    \longrightarrow
  H^{\bullet}(D(V))
   \overset{i^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{\bullet}(S(V))
    \to
  \cdots  
  \,.
$$

Since the cohomology in degree $k$ only depends on the $k$-skeleton, and since for $k \lt n$ the $k$-skeleton of $S(V)$ equals that of $X$, and since $D(V)$ is even homotopy equivalent to $X$, the morhism $i^\ast$ is an isomorphism in degrees lower than $n$. Hence by exactness of the sequence it follows that $H^{\bullet \lt n}(D(V),S(V)) = 0$.
