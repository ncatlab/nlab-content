###### Example

In lowest degrees the generalized Jacobi identity says that

1. for $n = 1$: the unary map $\partial \coloneqq l_1$ squares to 0:

   $$
     \partial (\partial(v_1)) = 0
   $$

1: for $n = 2$: the unary map $\partial$ is a graded [[derivation]] of the binary map

   $$
     [\partial v_1, v_2] + (-1)^{(\vert v_1\vert +1)(\vert v_2 \vert +1 ) } [\partial v_2, v_1]
     +
     \partial [v_1, v_2]
     =
     0
   $$

   hence
 
   $$
     \partial [v_1, v_2] =  [\partial v_1, v_2] + (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert}[v_1, v_2]
     \,.
   $$
