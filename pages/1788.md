
We proceed by [[induction]] over the number $k$ of arguments.

For $k = 1$ there is nothing to be shown. So assume that the $\Delta_F$-star product of $k$ local observables with pairwise disjoint spacetime support exists as a [[microcausal polynomial observable]] $A_{mc} = A_1 \star_F \cdots \star_F A_k$. We need to see that for $A_{k+1}$ any [[local observable]] whose spacetime support is disjoint from that of all of the $A_i$, hence disjoint from that of $A_{mc}$, the star product $A_{k+1} \star_F A_{mc}$ exists and is again microcausal.
