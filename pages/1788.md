In the context of [[homotopy theory]], a [[pullback]] diagram, such as in the definition of the [[fiber]] in def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}

$$
  \array{
     fib(f) &\longrightarrow& X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$

ought to [[commuting diagram|commute]] only up to a (left/right) [[homotopy]] (def. \ref{LeftAndRightHomotopyInAModelCategory}) between the outer composite morphisms. Moreover, it should satisfy its [[universal property]] up to such homotopies.

Instead of going through the full theory of what this means, we observe that this is plausibly modeled by the following construction, and then we check ([below](#HomotopyFibers)) that this indeed has the relevant abstract homotopy theoretic properties.

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ a [[model category]], def. \ref{ModelCategory}. 

For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism between cofibrant objects (hence a morphism in $\mathcal{C}_c\hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}), its _[[mapping cone]]_ is the object 

$$
  Cone(f)
  \coloneqq
  \ast \underset{X}{\sqcup} Cyl(X) \underset{X}{\sqcup} Y
$$

in the colimiting diagram

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& Cyl(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}} & \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& &\to& Cone(f) 
  }
  \,,
$$

where $Cyl(X)$ is a [[cylinder object]] for $X$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.

Dually, for $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ a morphism between fibrant objects (hence a morphism in $\mathcal{C}_f\hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}), its _[[mapping cocone]]_ is the object 

$$
  Cocone(f) \coloneqq \ast \underset{Y}{\times} Path(Y)\underset{Y}{\times} X
$$

in the following limit diagram

$$
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\longrightarrow& &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}& && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
      &&  Path(Y) &\underset{\delta_0}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $Path(Y)$ is [[path space object]] for $Y$, def. \ref{PathAndCylinderObjectsInAModelCategory}.

###### Remark

If we write homotopies as double arrows between morphisms, then then limit diagram in def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone} looks just like the square in the definition of [[fibers]] in def. \ref{FiberAndCofiberInPointedObjects}, except that it is filled by the right homotopy given by the component map denoted $\eta$:

$$
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Dually, the colimiting diagram for the mapping cone turns to look just like the square for the [[cofiber]], except that it is filled with a left homotopy 

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\eta}& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& cone(f)
  }
$$

###### Proposition

The colimit appearing in the definition of the [[mapping cone]] in def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone} is equivalent to three consecutive [[pushouts]]:

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} &(po)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& Cyl(X) &\longrightarrow& Cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow & (po) & \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& Cone(X) &\to& Cone(f) 
  }
  \,.
$$

The two intermediate objects appearing here are called

* the plain _[[cone]]_  $Cone(X) \coloneqq \ast \underset{X}{\sqcup} Cyl(X)$;

* the _[[mapping cylinder]]_ $Cyl(f) \coloneqq Cyl(X) \underset{X}{\sqcup} Y$.

Dually, the limit appearing in the definition of the [[mapping cocone]] in def. \ref{MappingConeAndMappingCocone} is equivalent to three consecutive [[pullbacks]]:

$$
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\longrightarrow& Path(f) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    Path_\ast(Y)  &\longrightarrow&  Path(Y) &\underset{\delta_0}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

The two intermediate objects appearing here are called

* the _base path space object_ $Path_\ast(Y) \coloneqq \ast \underset{Y}{\prod} Path(Y)$;

* the _mapping path space_ or _mapping co-cylinder_ $Path(f) \coloneqq X \underset{Y}{\times} Path(X)$.

Intuitively this says that $cone(f)$ is the object obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. gluing to one end of that the object $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Intuitively it is clear that this way every [[cycle]] in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be "continuously" translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it becomes the point. This means that every [[homotopy group]] of $Y$ in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping conee **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it clear how $cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[cokernel]] of $f$. And therefore the name "mapping cone".
