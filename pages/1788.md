Conversely, [[smooth functions]] are the [[non-singular distributions]]. The collection of points around which a distribution is singular (i.e. not [[non-singular distribution|non-singular]]) is called its _[[singular support]]_.

The [[Fourier transform of distributions]] decomposes a [[generalized function]] into the [[plane wave]] modes that it is made of. The [[Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem]] says that the singular nature of a [[compactly supported distribution]] may be read off from this [[Fourier mode]] decomposition:  Singularities correspond to large contributions by Fourier modes of high [[frequency]] and small [[wavelength]], hence to large "[[ultraviolet divergence|ultraviolet]]" (UV) contributions. Therefore the [[singular support]] of a distribution is the set of points around which the Fourier transform does not sufficiently decay "in the UV".

But since the [[Fourier transform]] is a function of the full [[wave vector]] of the [[plane wave]] modes,  not just of the [[frequency]]/[[wavelength]], but also of the [[direction of a vector|direction]] of the wave vector, this means that it contains _[[direction of a vector|directional]] information_ about the singularities: A distibution may have UV-singularities at some point and in some [[wave vector]] [[direction of a vector|direction]], but maybe not in other [[direction of a vector|directions]]. If the distribution in question is a [[distributional solution to a partial differential equation]] on [[spacetime]] then the _[[propagation of singularities theorem]]_ says that the [[singular support]] of the solution evolves in spacetime along the direction of those [[wave vectors]] along which the Fourier transform exhibits high UV constributions. This means that these directions are the "wave front" of the distributional solution. Accordingly, the [[singular support]] of a distribution together with, over each of its points, the [[direction of a vector|directions]] of [[wave vectors]] in which the Fourier transform around that point has large UV constributions is called the _[[wave front set]]_ of the distribution. 

What is called _[[microlocal analysis]]_ is essentially the analysis of [[distributions]] with attention to their [[wave front set]], hence to the [[wave vector]]-[[direction of a vector|directions]] of [[UV divergences]].

In particular the [[product of distributions]] is well defined (only) if the [[wave front sets]] of the distributions to not "collide". And this in fact motivates the definition of the wave front set:

Let $u,v \in  \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^1)$ be two [[distributions]], for simplicity of exposition taken on the [[real line]].

Since the product $u \cdot v$, is, if it exists, supposed to generalize the _pointwise_ product of smooth functions, it must be fixed locally: for every point $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there ought to be a [[compactly supported function|compactly supported]] [[smooth function]] ([[bump function]]) $b \in C^\infty_{cp}(\mathbb{R})$ with $f(x) = 1$ such that

$$
  b^2 u \cdot v = (b u) \cdot (b v)
  \,.
$$

But now $b v$ and $b u$ are both [[compactly supported distributions]], and these have the special property that their [[Fourier transform of distributions|Fourier transforms]] $\widehat{b v}$ and $\widehat{b u}$ are, in particular, [[smooth functions]] (by the [[Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem]]).

Moreover, the operation of [[Fourier transform]] intertwines pointwise products with [[convolution products]]. This means that if the product of distributions $u \cdot v$ exists, it must locally be given by the inverse Fourier transform of the [[convolution product]] of the Fourier transforms $\widehat {b u}$ and $\widehat b v$:

$$
  \widehat{ b^2 u \cdot v }(x)
  \;=\;
  \underset{\underset{k_{max} \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}
  \,
  \int_{- k_{max}}^{k_{max}} \widehat{(b u)}(k) \widehat{(b v)}(x - k) d k
  \,.
$$

(Notice that the converse of this formula holds as a fact: [this prop.](Fourier+transform#FourierTransformOfDistributionsInterchangesConvolutionOfDistributionsWithPointwiseProduct).)

This shows that the product of distributions exists once there is a [[bump function]] $b$ such that the [[integral]] on the right converges as $k_{max} \to \infty$.

Now the [[Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem]] says more, it says that the Fourier transforms $\widehat {b u}$ and $\widehat {b u}$ are polynomially bounded. On the other hand, the [[integral]] above is well defined if the [[integrand]] decreases at least quadratically with $k \to \infty$.
This means that for the convolution product to be well defined, either $\widehat {b u}$ has to polynomially decrease faster with $k \to \pm \infty$ than $\widehat {b v}$ grows in the _other_ direction, $k \to \mp \infty$ (due to the minus sign in the argument of the second factor in the [[convolution product]]), or the other way around.

Moreover, the degree of polynomial growth of the [[Fourier transform of distributions|Fourier transform]] increases by one with each [[derivative of distributions|derivative]]. Therefore if the [[product law]] for [[derivatives of distributions]] is to hold generally, we need that either $\widehat{b u}$ or $\widehat{b v}$ decays faster than _any_ polynomial in the opposite of the directions in which the respective other factor does not decay.

Here the set of directions of wave vectors in which the Fourier transform of a distribution localized around any point does not decay exponentially is called the _[[wave front set]]_ of a distribution. Hence the condition that the product of two distributions is well defined is that for each wave vector direction in the wave front set of one of the two distributions, the opposite direction must not be an element of the wave front set of the other distribution.
