Clearly the only way to go about achieving this is to have the horizontal morphisms be the [[braiding]] homomorphisms of the [[smash product]]. To see this more clearly, consider labeling the two copies of the circle appearing here as $S^1_a$ and $S^1_b$. Then the diagram we are dealing with looks like this:

$$
  \array{
     S_a^1 \wedge S_b^1 \wedge X_n &\longrightarrow& S_b^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S_a^1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{S^1_a \wedge \sigma_n}}\downarrow 
       &(nc)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n \wedge S^1_a}}
     \\
     S_a^1 \wedge X_{n-1} &\longrightarrow& X_{n-1} \wedge S_a^1
  }
$$

This makes it manifest that as $S^1_a$ passes long the top and right, it has to be braided past $S^1_b$, while this does not occur as $S^1_a$ passes down and left. Since the braiding $S^1_a \wedge S^1_b \to S^1_b \wedge S^1_a$ is nontrivial (the homotopy class of this map differs from the identity by a minus sign in $\p_2(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$), there is no way to make this diagram commute.

However, we may get around this by considering two consecutive structure maps, such that $S_a^2$ is to be braided around. Then it works.
