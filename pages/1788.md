One consequence of theorem \ref{ProjectiveModelStructureOnTopologicalFunctors} is the model category theoretic incarnation of the theory of [[homotopy colimits]].

Observe that ordinary [[limits]] and [[colimits]] (def. \ref{LimitsAndColimits}) are equivalently characterized in terms of [[adjoint functors]]:

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any [[category]] and let $I$ be a [[small category]]. Write $[I,\mathcal{C}]$ for the corresponding [[functor category]]. We may think of its objects as $I$-shaped [[diagrams]] in $\mathcal{C}$, and of its morphisms as homomorphisms of these diagrams.  There is a canonical functor

$$
  \mathcal{C} \overset{const}{\longrightarrow} [I,\mathcal{C}]
$$

which sends each object of $\mathcal{C}$ to the diagram that is constant on this object. Then unwinding the definition of the [[universal properties]] of [[limits]] and [[colimits]], one sees that 

1. precisely when $\mathcal{C}$ has all [[colimits]] of shape $I$, then the functor $const$ has a [[left adjoint]] functor, which is the operation of forming these colimits:

   $$
     [I,\mathcal{C}]
       \underoverset
        {\underset{const}{\longleftarrow}}
        {\overset{\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}}{\longrightarrow}}
        {\bot}
     \mathcal{C}
   $$

1. precisely when $\mathcal{C}$ has all [[limits]] of shape $I$, then the functor $const$ has a [[right adjoint]] functor, which is the operation of forming these limits.

   $$
     [I,\mathcal{C}]
       \underoverset
        {\underset{\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}}{\longrightarrow}}
        {\overset{const}{\longleftarrow}}
     \mathcal{C}
   $$
