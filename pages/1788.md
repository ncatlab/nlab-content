######Definition
We shall say that a map $u:A\to B$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$ 
has the *left lifting property* with respect to a map $f:X\to Y$, 
or that $f$ has the *right lifting property* with respect to $u$,
if every commutative square
\begin{xymatrix}
A  \ar[d]_u \ar[r]^{x}  & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
B \ar[r]_{y}         & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a _diagonal filler_ $d:B\to X$,
\begin{xymatrix}
A  \ar[d]_u \ar[r]^{x} & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
B \ar[r]_{y} \ar[ur]^d        & Y
\end{xymatrix}
We shall denote this relation by $u\,\pitchfork\, f$.
Notice that the condition $u\,\pitchfork\, f$ means that
the following commutative square $Sq(u,f)$,
\[
\label{20}
\]
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(B,X)  \ar[d]_{hom(B,f)}  \ar[rr]^{hom(u,X)}  & & hom(A,X)  \ar[d]^{hom(A,f)}  \\
hom(B,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(u,Y)}      & & hom(A,Y),
\end{xymatrix}
is [epicartesian](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares),
or equivalently if the map
$$Hom(u,f)': hom(B,X)\to hom(B,Y) \times_{hom(A,Y)}hom(A,X)$$
is surjective.

######Notation
If $\mathcal{M}$
is a class of maps,
we shall denote by ${}^\pitchfork\!\mathcal{M}$ (resp. 
$\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$)
the class of maps having the left (resp. the right) lifting property
with respect to every map in $\mathcal{M}$.
We shall say that ${}^\pitchfork\!\!\mathcal{M}$ is the *left complement* of
$\mathcal{M}$, and that $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is its *right complement*.

######Example
Recall  that a map of simplicial sets is said to be a [[Kan fibration]]
if it has the right lifting property with respect to 
the inclusion $h^k_n: \Lambda^k[n] \subset  \Delta[n]$
for every $n\gt 0$ and $0\le k\le n$. 
A simplicial set $X$ is a [[Kan complex]] iff
the map $X\to 1$ is a Kan fibration.

Then a functor in the category $\mathbf{Cat}$

with respect to the inclusion $\{0\}\subset J$.

######Definition
We shall say that a pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ of classes of maps
in a category $\mathbf{E}$ is a **weak factorisation system**
if the following conditions are satisfied:

* every map $f:A\to B$ admits a factorisation $f=p u:A\to E\to B$ 
with $u\in \mathcal{L}$ and $p\in \mathcal{R}$;


* $\mathcal{L}= {}^\pitchfork\mathcal{R}$ and 
$\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork $;

=--

We shall say that a factorisation $f=p u:A\to E\to B$ with $u\in \mathcal{L}$ and $p\in \mathcal{R}$ is a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-*factorisation* of the map $f$. The class $\mathcal{L}$ is called the *left class* of the system, and the class $\mathcal{R}$ is called the *right class* . 




+-- {: .un_defn #FSimpliesWFS}

The category of sets $\mathbf{Set}$
admits a weak factorisation system $(Inj,Surj)$, where
$Inj$ the class of injections 
and $Surj$ is the class of surjections.

######Duality
If $( \mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation system
in a category $\mathbf{E}$, then the pair
$(\mathcal{R}^o,\mathcal{L}^o)$ is a weak factorisation system
in the opposite category $\mathbf{E}^o$.
=--


If $\mathcal{M}$ is a class of maps in a category $\mathbf{E}$,
then for any object $B\in \mathbf{E}$ we shall denote
by $\mathcal{M}/B$ the class of maps in the slice
category $\mathbf{E}/B$
whose underlying map in $\mathbf{E}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.
Dually, we shall denote by $B\backslash \mathcal{M}$ the class of maps in the coslice category $B\backslash \mathbf{E}$ whose underlying map belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.


+--{: .un_prop #slicewfs}
###### Slice and coslice
If $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation
system in a category $\mathbf{E}$, then the pair
$(\mathcal{L}/B,\mathcal{R}/B)$ is a weak factorisation system
in the slice category $\mathbf{E}/B$ for any object
$B$ in $\mathbf{E}$. Dually, the pair
$(B\backslash \mathcal{L},B\backslash \mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation system in the coslice category $B\backslash \mathbf{E}$.

######Proof
Left to the reader.

##Closure properties##



If $\mathcal{C} $ and $\mathcal{F} $
are two classes of maps in $\mathbf{E}$, we shall 
write $\mathcal{C}\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{F} $
to indicate that we have $u\pitchfork f$ for every $u\in \mathcal{C} $
and $f\in \mathcal{F} $. 
The three conditions
$$ \mathcal{C}\subseteq {}^\pitchfork \mathcal{F}, \quad \quad  \mathcal{C} \,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{F},\quad \quad
\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{C}^\pitchfork  $$
are equivalent.
If $\mathcal{C}=\{u\}$,
we shall write $u \,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{F} $ instead of 
$\{u\}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{F} $. Similarly, we shall write
$\mathcal{C} \,\pitchfork\, f$ instead of $\mathcal{C} \pitchfork \{f\}$.


The operations $\mathcal{M}\mapsto \mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$
and $\mathcal{M}\mapsto {}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$
on classes of maps 
are contravariant and mutually adjoint.
It follows
that the operations
$\mathcal{M}\mapsto ({}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M})^\pitchfork$
and $\mathcal{M}\mapsto {}^\pitchfork(\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork)$
are closure operators.




+-- {: .num_lemma #scholieselflift}
######Lemma
The following conditions on a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$
are equivalent:

$$f \mathrm{is}\:\mathrm{invertible}, \quad \mathbf{E}\,\pitchfork\, f, 
\quad f\,\pitchfork\, f, \quad f\,\pitchfork\, \mathbf{E}.$$ 
=--



+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
($1\Rightarrow 2$)
If $f$ is invertible, then the square
\begin{xymatrix}
A  \ar[d]_u \ar[r]^{x}  & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
B \ar[r]_{y}         & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $f^{-1}y:B\to X$.
Thus, $u\,\pitchfork\, f$ for any arrow $u$, and hence 
$\mathbf{E}\,\pitchfork\, f$.
($2\Rightarrow 3$) If $\mathbf{E}\,\pitchfork\, f$, then 
$f\,\pitchfork\,f$. 
($3\Rightarrow 1$) If $f\,\pitchfork\,f$, then the square
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[d]_f \ar@{=}[r]  &   X  \ar[d]^f \\
Y \ar@{=}[r]         & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $g:Y\to X$ and this shows that $f$ is invertible.
The equivalences ($1\Leftrightarrow 2\Leftrightarrow 3$)
are proved. The equivalences ($1\Leftrightarrow 4\Leftrightarrow 3$)
are proved similarly.
=--



Recall that a map $u:A\to B$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$ is said to be 
a *retract* of another map $v:C\to D$,
if $u$ is a retract of $v$ in the category of arrows $\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.
The condition means that there exists four maps $p,i,q,j$ fitting in
a commutative diagram
\begin{xymatrix}A \ar[d]^u\ar[r]^i& C \ar[d]^v\ar[r]^p & A \ar[d]^u \\ 
B \ar[r]^j & D \ar[r]^q &  B
\end{xymatrix}
and such that $p i=1_A$ and $q j=1_B$.

###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under retracts* 
if every retract of a map in $\mathcal{M}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.
=--





We recall that the *base change* of a map $f:X\to Y$
along a map $v:V\to X$ is the map $g:U \to V$
in a pullback square,
\begin{xymatrix}
U  \ar[d]_g \ar[r]  & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
V \ar[r]_{v}         & Y
\end{xymatrix}


Dually, the *cobase change* of a map $u:A\to B$
along a map $c:A\to C$ is the map $v:C\to D$
in a pushout square,
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{u} \ar[r]^{c} & C\ar[d]^{v}\\
B \ar[r]  & D.
\end{xymatrix}

###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under base changes* 
if the base change of a map in $\mathcal{M}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$,
when the base change exists.
The notion of a class of maps *closed under cobase changes* 
is defined dually.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #defcloseundercoproducts}
###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under coproducts* 
if the coproduct
$$\sqcup_{i\in I}u_i: \sqcup_{i\in I} A_i\to \sqcup_{i\in I} B_i$$
of any family of maps $(u_i:i\in I)$ in $\mathcal{M}$
belongs to $\mathcal{M}$, when this
coproduct exists.
The notion of a class of maps closed under products
is defined similarly.

+-- {: .num_lemma #closureofcomplementsfirst}
######Lemma
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a class of maps in a
category $\mathbf{E}$.
Then the class $\mathcal{M}^\bot$ contains the isomorphisms
and is closed under composition, retracts, products,
and base changes.
Dually, the class ${}^\bot\mathcal{M}$ is 
contains the isomorphisms and
is closed under composition, retracts, coproducts,
and cobase changes.
=--



+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof
That class ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$ contains the isomorphisms 
by Scholie \ref{scholieselflift}.
Let us show that it
is closed under composition. We shall use the
properties of [[Cartesian squares|epicartesian]] squares.
Let us show that if two morphisms $u:A\to B$ and $v:B\to C$
belongs to ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$, then so
does their composite $v u:A\to C$.
For any morphism $f:X\to Y$, the square $Sq(v u,f)$
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(C,X)   \ar[rr]^{hom(v u,X)} \ar[d]_{hom(C,f)}  & & hom(A,X)  \ar[d]^{hom(A,f)}  \\
hom(C,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(v u,Y)}      & & hom(A,Y),
\end{xymatrix}
can be obtained by composing horizontally the squares $Sq(u,f)$
and $Sq(v,f)$,
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(C,X)   \ar[rr]^{hom(v ,X)} \ar[d]_{hom(C,f)}  & &
hom(B,X)  \ar[d]_{hom(B,f)}  \ar[rr]^{hom(u,X)}  & & hom(A,X)  \ar[d]^{hom(A,f)}  \\
hom(C,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(v,Y)} & & hom(B,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(u,Y)}      
& & hom(A,Y).
\end{xymatrix}
The squares $Sq(u,f)$
and $Sq(v,f)$ are epicartesian if $f\in \mathcal{M}$;
hence their composite is epicartesian by the lemma
[here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#cancelquasicartesian).
This shows that $v u\in {}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$.
We have proved that the class ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$
is closed under composition.
Let us now show that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ 
is closed under retracts.
If a map $f:X\to Y$ is a retract of a map $g:U\to V$,
then the square $Sq(u,f)$ is a retract of the square $Sq(u,g)$
for any map $u:A\to B$.
But a retract of an epicartesian square
is epicartesian by the lemma
[here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#retractquasicart). 
It follows that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is closed under retracts. Let us show that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$
is closed under products.
If a map $f:X\to Y$ is the product of a family of maps
$f_i:X_i\to Y_i$ ($i\in I$), then the square
$Sq(u,f)$ is the product of the family of 
squares $Sq(u,f_i)$.
But the product of a family of epicartesian 
squares is epicartesians by the lemma 
[here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#productquasicart}). 
This shows that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is closed under 
products. 
Let us show that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ 
is closed under base changes.
Suppose that we have a pullback square

\[
\label{01}
\]
\begin{xymatrix}
U \ar[d]_g \ar[r]^u  &  X  \ar[d]^f \\
V \ar[r]^v      & Y
\end{xymatrix}
with $f\in \mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ and let us prove
that $g\in \mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$.
It suffices to show that the square $Sq(u,g)$ 
is epicartesian for every morphism $u:A\to B$
in $\mathcal{M}$. But the
square is the back face of the following 
commutative cube,
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(B,U) \ar[rr] \ar[dd] \ar[dr] &   & hom(A,U)  \ar[dr]  \ar '[d] [dd]  & \\ &  hom(B,X)\ar[dd]\ar[rr] &   & hom(A,X) \ar[dd] \\ 
 hom(B,V) \ar[dr] \ar '[r] [rr]&  &   hom(A,V) \ar[dr] &  \\ 
& hom(B,Y)  \ar[rr] &   & hom(A,Y) .
\end{xymatrix}
The left and the right faces of the cube are cartesian,
since the square (eq:01) is cartesian and the
functors $hom(A,-)$ and $hom(B,-)$ preserve limits.
The front face is epicartesian
since we have $u\pitchfork p$.
Hence the back face is epicartesian by the cube
lemma [here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#cubelemmaquasicart).

###### Proposition
The two classes of a weak factorisation system $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ contain the isomorphisms and they
are closed under composition and retracts. 
The right class $\mathcal{R}$ is closed
under base changes and products, and
the left class $\mathcal{L}$ 
under cobase changes and coproducts.
The intersection $\mathcal{L}\,\cap \,\mathcal{R}$ is the class of isomorphisms.

######Proof
This follows from Lemma \ref{closureofcomplementsfirst}

since $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork$

######Definition
Recall that a map $u:A\to B$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$  is said to be
a *domain retract*
of a map $v:C\to B$,
if the object $(A,u)$ of the category $\mathbf{E}/B$ is a retract of
the object $(C,v)$.
There is a dual notion of *codomain retract*.

###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under domain retracts* 
if every domain retract of a map in $\mathcal{M}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.
The notion of a class closed under codomain retract is defined similarly.
=--





+-- {: .num_prop #WFS2}
######Theorem
A pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ 
of classes of maps in a category $\mathbf{E}$ is a 
weak factorisation system iff the following conditions are satisfied:

* every map $f:X\to Y$ admits a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-factorisation 
$f=p u:X\to E\to Y$; 
* $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}$;
* the class $\mathcal{L}$ is closed under codomain retracts
and the class $\mathcal{R}$ under domain retracts.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
The implication ($\Rightarrow$) is clear since the classes of a weak factorisation
system are closed under retracts by Proposition
\ref{ClosureofleftandrightclassesWFS}.
Let us prove the implication ($\Leftarrow$).
We have $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{L}^\pitchfork $
since we have $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{R}$ by the hypothesis.
Let us show that we have $\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork \subseteq \mathcal{R}$.
If a map $f:X\to Y$ belongs to $\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork$, let us choose
a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-factorisation $f=p u:X\to E\to Y$.
The square
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[d]_u \ar@{=}[r] & X  \ar[d]^f\\
E  \ar[r]^p    & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $r:E\to X$ since we have 
$u\,\pitchfork\, f$.
Hence we have $f r=p$ and $r u =1_X$
and this shows that $f$ is a domain retract of $p$.
Thus, $f\in \mathcal{R}$, since $\mathcal{R}$
is closed under domain retracts by hypothesis. 
=--



Recall that a class $\mathcal{C}$ of objects in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is said to be *replete* if every object isomorphic to an object
in $\mathcal{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{C}$.
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$ 
in $\mathbf{E}$ is **replete**,
if it is replete as a class of objects of the category
$\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.




+-- {: .num_prop #incompleteWFS}
######Corollary
Suppose that a pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ of classes
of maps  in a category $\mathbf{E}$ satisfies the
following three conditions:

* every map $f:X\to Y$ admits a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-factorisation 
$f=p u:X\to E\to Y$; 

* $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}$;

* the classes $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
are replete. 

If $\mathcal{L}'$ denotes the class of maps which are codomain retracts
of maps in $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{R}'$ denotes the class of 
maps which are domain retracts of maps in $\mathcal{R}$,
then the pair $(\mathcal{L}',\mathcal{R}')$
is a weak factorisation system.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
The condition  $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}$
implies the condition $\mathcal{L}'\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}'$
by Lemma \ref{closureofcomplementsfirst}.
It is easy to see that $\mathcal{L}'$
is closed under codomain retracts,
and that $\mathcal{R}'$ is closed under domain retracts.
The result then follows from Theorem \ref{WFS2}.

######Definition
For any ordinal $\alpha$, let us put $[\alpha]=\{i :0\le i \le \alpha \}$
and $[\alpha)=\{i :0\le i \lt \alpha \}$.
Let $\mathbf{E}$ be a cocomplete category.
We shall say that a functor $C:[\alpha] \to  \mathbf{E}$
is a *chain of lentgth* $\alpha$, or an $\alpha$-*chain*.
The *composite* of $C$ 
is defined to be the canonical map $C(0)\to C( \alpha)$.
The *base* of $C$ is the restriction of $C$ to $[\alpha)$. 
The chain $C$ is *cocontinuous* 
if the canonical map 
$$ \mathrm{colim}_{i\lt j} C(i)\to C(j)$$

We shall say that a subcategory $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbf{E}$

######Lemma
The class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is closed
under transfinite op-compositions for any
class of maps $\mathcal{M}$ in a complete category $\mathbf{E}$.
=--


+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
Let us show that if $\alpha \gt 0$ is a limit ordinal
then every continuous op-chain $C:[\alpha]\to \mathbf{E}$
with a base in $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $
has its composite in $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $.
Let us denote by $c(j,i)$ the transition map $C(j)\to C(i)$
defined for $0\le i\le j\le \alpha$.
For any morphism $u:A\to B$, let us denote
by $Sq(u,C)$ the contravariant functor 
$[\alpha]\to  \mathbf{Set}^I$ obtained
by putting $Sq(u,C)(i)=hom(u,C(i)):hom(B,C(i))\to hom(A,C(i))$
for $i\in [\alpha]$.
By definition, the functor $Sq(u,C)$ takes a pair $i\leq j$
to the square $Sq(u,c(j,i))$,
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(B,C(j))  \ar[rr]^{hom(u,C(j))}  \ar[d]_{hom(B,c(j,i))}   
& &  hom(A,C(j))  \ar[d]^{hom(A,c(j,i))}  \\
hom(B,C(i)) \ar[rr]_{hom(u,C(i))}     & & hom(A,C(i)).
\end{xymatrix}
Beware that here the square $Sq(u,c(j,i))$
is defining a morphism from
the its top horizontal line to the bottom horizontal line;
this means that we are presently using the vertical composition
in the category of squares).
The (vertical) op-chain $Sq(u,C):[\alpha]\to  \mathbf{Set}^I$
is continuous, since $C$ is continuous. 
If $u\in \mathcal{M}$, then 
the square $Sq(u,c(j,i))$ is epicartesian 
for every $i\leq j\lt \alpha$ by the assumption on $C$.
It follows that the square $Sq(u,c(\alpha,0))$ is epicartesian by the lemma [here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#transfiniteopcompquasicart).
This show that $c(\alpha,0)$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $,
and hence that $$\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $
is closed under transfinite op-compositions.

is saturated. Let us say that a map in a cocomplete
category is *surjective* if it is left orthogonal
to every monomorphisms; then the class of surjective maps

######Proposition
The class ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$ 
is saturated for any class of maps $\mathcal{M}$ in a cocomplete category
$\mathbf{E}$. In particular, the left class of a weak factorisation system in a cocomplete category is saturated.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
The class ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$ contains the isomorphisms 
and it is closed under composition, retracts and cobase changes by 
\ref{closureofcomplementsfirst}. And it is closed under
transfinite compositions by Lemma \ref{rightclassopcomposition}
dualised.

######Lemma
A cellular class of maps is closed under coproducts. 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a cellular class of maps in a 
cocomplete category $\mathbf{E}$.
We shall say that an object $A\in \mathbf{E}$
*cofibrant*, if the map $\bot \to A$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$,
where $\bot$ is the initial object of $\mathbf{E}$.
We shall first prove that the coproduct of a
family of cofibrant objects is cofibrant. 
Let us first show that the coproduct of a finite
family of cofibrant objects is cofibrant.
The identity map $\bot \to \bot$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$,
since $\mathcal{M}$ contains the isomorphisms.
Hence the object $\bot $ is cofibrant.
This show that the coproduct of the empty
family of objects is cofibrant.
It remains to show that the coproduct of a finite
non-empty family of cofibrant objects is cofibrant.
For this it suffices to show that the coproduct
of two cofibrant objects is cofibrant.
If $A$ and $B$ are cofibrant, 
consider the pushout square
\begin{xymatrix}
\bot \ar[r]\ar[d]&  B \ar[d]^{i_B} \\
A   \ar[r]^(0.4){i_A}&  A\sqcup B .
\end{xymatrix}
The map $i_B$ is a cobase change
of the map $\bot \to A$. Thus, $i_B\in \mathcal{M}$,
since $A$ is cofibrant and $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under cobase change.
The map $\bot \to B$ also belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$, since $B$ is cofibrant.
Hence the composite $\bot \to B\to  A\sqcup B$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$,
since $ \mathcal{M}$ is closed under composition.
This shows that $ A\sqcup B$ is cofibrant.
Let us now show that the coproduct 
$$A= \bigsqcup_{i\in I} A_i  $$
of an infinite family of cofibrant objects $(A_i:i\in I)$ is cofibrant.
We shall argue by induction on the ordinal $\alpha=\mathrm{Card}(I)$. 
If $j\lt \alpha$, let us put
$$C(j)=\bigsqcup_{i\lt j} A_i.$$
There is an obvious canonical map $C(j)\to C(k)$
for $j\le k \le \alpha$ and
this defines a cocontinuous chain $C:[\alpha] \to \mathbf{E}$.
Notice that $C(0)=\bot$ and $C(\alpha)=A$.
Hence we can  prove that $A$ is cofibrant by showing
that the composite of $C$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$.
For this it suffices to show that the base of $C$ belongs to 
$ \mathcal{M}$, since $ \mathcal{M}$
is closed under transfinite compositions.
But the object
$$C(j,k)=\bigsqcup_{j\le i\lt k} A_i$$
is cofibrant for every $j\le k\lt \alpha$
by the induction hypothesis, since $k\lt \alpha$. 
And the transition map $C(j)\to C(k)$ is a base change
of the map $\bot \to C(j,k)$
since we have a pushout square
\begin{xymatrix}
\bot \ar[r]\ar[d]&  C(j) \ar[d] \\
C(j,k)  \ar[r]&  C(k).
\end{xymatrix} 
This shows that the transition map $C(j)\to C(k)$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$
for every $j\le k\lt \alpha$.
We have proved that the base of $C$
belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$ and hence that the object $A$ is cofibrant.
Let us now show that the class $ \mathcal{M}$ is closed under coproducts.
For this, let us show that the coproduct $u:A\to B$ of a family of maps 
$u_i:A_i\to B_i$ ($i\in I$) in $ \mathcal{M}$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$.
For this, let us denote by $ \mathcal{M}'$ the class of maps in the category 
$A\backslash  \mathbf{E}$ whose underlying map in $\mathbf{E}$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$.
It is easy to verify that the class $ \mathcal{M}'$ satisfies the hypothesis
of the proposition. 
Let us put $E_i=B_i\sqcup_{A_i}A$ for each $i\in I$,
\begin{xymatrix}
A_i\ar[r]\ar[d]_{u_i}&  A \ar[d]^{v_i} \\
B_i  \ar[r] & E_i.
\end{xymatrix} 
The object $(B,u)$ of $A\backslash \mathbf{E}$
is the coproduct of the family of objects $(E_i,v_i)$ for $i\in I$.
The map $v_i:A\to E_i$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$, since $u_i\in \mathcal{M}$ by assumption, and since the class $ \mathcal{M}$ is closed under cobase change. Hence the object $(E_i,v_i)$ of the category $A\backslash \mathbf{E}$
is cofibrant with respect to the class $ \mathcal{M}'$.
It follows that the object $(B,u)$ is cofibrant by the first part of the proof. This proves that $u\in   \mathcal{M}$.

######Definition
If $\alpha$ is a regular cardinal,
we shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$ in a complete category
$\mathbf{E}$ 
is  $\alpha$-*cellular* if it satisfies the following conditions:
* $\mathcal{M}$ contains the isomorphisms and is closed under composition;
* $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under transfinite compositions of cocontinuous   chains of length $\le \alpha$;
* $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under cobase changes;
* $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under coproducts.

We shall say that an $\alpha$-cellular class $\mathcal{C}$
is  $\alpha$-*saturated* if in addition,

* $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under retracts.

Every class of maps $\Sigma\subseteq \mathbf{E}$ 
is contained in a smallest $\alpha$-cellular class $Cell^\alpha(\Sigma)$
called the $\alpha$-cellular class *generated* by $\Sigma$.
Similarly, $\Sigma$ is contained in a smallest $\alpha$-saturated class $Sat(\Sigma)$
called the $\alpha$-saturated class *generated* by $\Sigma$.
