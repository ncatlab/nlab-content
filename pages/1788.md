###### Definition
**([[evolutionary vector fields]] and [[antifields]])**

Let $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ be a [[fiber bundle]]. Then an [[evolutionary vector field]] $v$ is a smooth bundle morphism

$$
  \array{
    J^\infty_\Sigma(E)
    && \overset{v}{\longrightarrow} &&
    V_\Sigma E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{jb_{\infty,0}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathllap{}}
    \\
    && E
  }
  \,.
$$

We write

$$
  \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(T J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E) Mod^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

for the space of evolutionary vector fields, 
regarded as a [[graded module]] over the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]]

$$
  \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)
  \;=\;
  C^\infty\left( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \right)
$$

of [[smooth functions]] on the [[jet bundle]].

For the construction of the [[BV-BRST complex]] in the following, we will want to 
assign a _degree_ to evolutionary vector field, namely degree -1. 
The above module regarded as a [[graded module]] concentrated all in degree -1
is denoted by

$$
  \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(T J^\infty_\Sigma(E))[-1]
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E) Mod^{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$


In the special case that $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ is a [[trivial vector bundle]]
with [[field (physics)|field]] [[coordinates]] $(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s$ as in example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}, then 
we write 

$$
  \overline \phi_a \;\coloneqq\; \partial_{\phi^a}[-1]
$$

for the induced basis elements of the space of those  [[vector fields]] on the [[jet bundle]] (def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) which are dual to the field coordinates,
but regarded in degree -1. These then provide a [[linear basis]] for the space of evolutionary vector fields
in that the canonical linear map is an [[isomorphism]] of [[graded modules]]:

$$
  \label{AntifieldCoordinates}
  \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)
  \langle
     \overline{\phi}_a
  \rangle
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma(E))[-1]
  \,.
$$

These generators $\overline{\phi}_a$ in degree -1 are called the _[[antifield]] coordinates_ 
corresponding to the [[field (physic)|field]] coordinates $\phi^a$.

###### Definition
**(implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetry]])**

Given a [[Lagrangian field theory]] $(E, \mathbf{L})$ (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}),
then an _implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetry]]_ is an [[evolutionary vector field]] 
$\epsilon \in \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)$
on which the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]] (prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) 
vanishes:

$$
  \iota_\epsilon \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0
  \,.
$$

In the special case that the [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ is a [[trivial vector bundle]]
over [[Minkowski spacetime]] (example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) 
with [[field (physics)|field]] coordinates $(\phi^a)$ and $(\overline{\phi}_a)$
and [[antifield]] coordinates $\overline{\phi}_a$ (eq:AntifieldCoordinates) an 
[[evolutionary vector field]] has an expansion of the form

$$
  \epsilon = R^a \partial_{\phi^a}
$$

where $(R^a \in \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E))_{a = 1}^s$ are smooth functions on the jet bundle; and in terms
of these coordinates the condition on $\epsilon$ to be a gauge symmetry is equivalent to the condition

$$
  R^a \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{ \delta \phi^a} = 0 \phantom{AAA} \in \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)
  \,.

###### Example
**(trivial implicial infinitesimal gauge transformations)**

Let $(E,\mathbf{L})$ be a [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}).

Then every [[evolutionary vector field]] (def. \ref{EvolutionaryVectorField}) of the special form

$$
  \epsilon 
  \coloneqq
  \frac{\delta_{EL} L }{\delta \phi^a} \kappa^{[a b]} \partial_{\phi^a}
  \;\in\;
  \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)
$$

for a collection of smooth functions $(\kappa^{[a b]} \in \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E))$ which is 
skew-symmetric in its indices ($\kappa^{[a b]} = - \kappa^{[b a]}$) is an 
implicit infinitesimal gauge symmetry (def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry}).

But since this is so for a "trivial reason" namely just that skew symmetry:

$$
  \iota_\epsilon \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}
  =
  \undeerset{= 0}{
  \underbrace{
   \left( \frac{\delta_{EL} L }{\delta \phi^a} \right)
   \left( \frac{\delta_{EL} L }{\delta \phi^b} \right)
   \kappa^{[a b]}
  }
  }
  \, 
  dvol_\Sigma
$$

these are called the _trivial_ implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations.

###### Proposition
**(implicit [[infinitesimal gauge transformations]] are [[infinitesimal symmetries of the Lagrangian]])**

For $(E, \mathbf{L})$ a [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}), then 
every implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetry]] $\epsilon$ (def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry})
is in particular an [[infinitesimal symmetry of the Lagrangian]] (def. \ref{SymmetriesAndConservedCurrents})
in that 

$$
  \iota_\epsilon \delta \mathbf{L}
   \;=\;
  d \tilde J_\epsilon
$$

for some $\tilde J_\epsilon$. Moreover, the  [[conserved currents]] associated to 
such $\epsilon$ by [[Noether's theorem]] (prop. \ref{NoethersFirstTheorem}) vanish identically.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows directly from the definitions: Using $\delta \mathbf{L} = \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} + d \Theta$
(prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) and the defining property
$\iota_\epsilon \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0$ (def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry})
together with the verticality of $\epsilon$ ($\iota_{\epsilon} \circ d = - d \circ \iota_{\epsilon}$)
we have:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \iota_\epsilon \delta \mathbf{L}
      & =
    \iota_\epsilon
    \left(
      \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}
       -
      d \Theta
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \underset{
      = 0
    }{
    \underbrace{
      \iota_\epsilon \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}
    }
    }
    -
    \underset{ = - d \iota_\epsilon \Theta}{
    \underbrace{
      \iota_\epsilon d \Theta
    }
    }
    \\
    & =
    d \underset{ = \tilde J_\epsilon }{\underbrace{ \iota_\epsilon \Theta }}
  \end{aligned}
$$

The point of implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations is that 
as soon as there is a single non-trivial one, i.e. one not vanishing on-shell,
then there cannot be any Cauchy surfaces for the equations of motion.
The reason is that 

1. the flow along implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations preserves the shell

2. if $\epsilon$ is an implicit infinitesimal gauge transformation, then so is
   $f \epsilon$ for $f \in \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)$ any smooth function on the jet bundle.
   In particular $f$ may depend arbitrarily on spacetime. 
   
Together this means that the flow along $f \epsilon$ may change a solution at arbitrary spacetime
points, while keeping it a soluton. In particular if we choose a would-be Cauchy surface, and
consider $f$ with spacetime support away from that surface, then every solution restricted to 
an infinitesimal neighbourhood of the Cauchy surface has infinitely many extension to solutions
on all of spacetime: with any one such extesion also the flow along $f \epsilon$ of that solution
is a solution, with the same initial Cauchy data.

Now the quantization prescription via [[Wick algebras]] for the [[free fields]] and
[[causal perturbation theory]] for the interacting fields relies on the assumption that the
equations of motion of the free field are given by a [[normally hyperbolic differential operator]].
However, on time-oriented globally hyperbolic spacetimes, these operators have unique 
advanced and retarded propagators. This means that solution are uniquely specified by
Cauchy data. Conversely this means that in the presence of non-trivial implicit infinitesimal gauge transformation,
the equations of motion can not be given by a normally hyperbolic operator, and hence in this case
quantization via causal perturbation theory is not applicable.

The idea BRST-BV quantization now is to fix this by 

1. enlarging the field bundle to a [[derived Lie algebroid]],

   1. hence enlarging the space of fields by adding more fields (equipped with grading)
   
   1. introducing a [[differential]] on these
   
   so that in [[cochain cohomology]] the original on-shell field species are
   recovered, hence so that this is a [[]]
      
1. such that the equations of motion for the system for the enlarged field space _are_
   normally hyperbolic and may hence be quantized by causal perturbation theory
   
1. such that this quantization preserves the differential suitably, so that after quantization
   we may again pass to cochain cohomology and interpret that result as the quantization of the 
   original system to be quantized.

###### Definition
**([[BV-complex]] of ordinary [[Lagrangian density]])**

Let $(E,\mathbf{L})$ be a [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})

Evaluation of [[evolutionary vector fields]] (def. \ref{EvolutionaryVectorField}) in the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]] $\delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} \in \Omega^{p,0}_\Sigma(E) \wedge \delta \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)$ (prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) yields a $\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)$-[[linear map]] 
(of degree +1 if we consider the evolutionary vector fields in degree -1)

$$
  \iota_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}}
  \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)[-1]
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E)
  \,.
$$

If we use the [[volume form]] $dvol_\Sigma$ on [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ to induce an identification

$$
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E) \;\simeq\; C^\infty(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))\langle dvol_\sigma\rangle
$$

with respect to which the [[Lagrangian density]] decomposes as

$$
  \mathbf{L} = L dvol_\Sigma
$$

then this is a linear map of the form

$$
  \iota_{\delta_{EL} L}
  \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)[-1]
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)
  \,.
$$

In the special case that the [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ is a [[trivial vector bundle]]
(example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) with [[field (physics)|field]] coordinates $(\phi^a)$
so that the Euler-Lagrange variational derivative has the expansion 

$$
  \delta_{EL}L
  \;=\;
  \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a} \delta \phi^a
$$

then this map is given on the [[antifield]] basis elements (eq:AntifieldCoordinates) by

$$
  \iota_{\delta_{EL}L}
  \;\colon\;
  \overline{\phi}_a
  \;\mapsto\;
  \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a}
  \,.
$$

Consider then the [[symmetric algebra|graded symmetric algebra]]

$$
  Sym_{\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)}\left(
    \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)[-1]
  \right)
$$

which is generated over $\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)$ from the [[evolutionary vector fields]] in degree -1, and let

$$
  \delta_{BV}
  \;\colon\;
    Sym_{\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)}\left(
    \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)[-1]
  \right)
  \;\longrightarrow\;
  Sym_{\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)}\left(
    \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)[-1]
  \right)
$$

be the unique extension of the linear map $\iota_{\delta_{EL}L}$ to a [[derivation]] of degree +1 on this algebra.

The resulting [[differential graded-commutative algebra]] 

$$
  \left(
    Sym_{\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)}\left(
      \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)[-1]
    \right)
    \,,\,
    \delta_{BV}
  \right)
$$

is called the _[[BV-complex]]_ of the Lagrangian field theory.

=--

The [[cochain cohomology]] of the [[BV-complex]] has the following interpretation:


in degree 0:


$$
  im( \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma(E)) \overset{\delta_{BV}}{\to} \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E))
$$

is functions on the [[shell]].

in degree -1:

$$
  ker( \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma(E)) \overset{\delta_{BV}}{\to} \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E))
$$

is the implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetries]] (def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry})

and

$$
  im( 
    \Gamma_{\Sigma}^{ev}(V_\Sigma E) \wedge_{\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E)} \Gamma_\Sigma^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)  
      \overset{\delta_{BV}}{\longrightarrow}
    \Gamma_{\Sigma}^{ev}(V_\Sigma E)
  )
$$

is the trivial implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations (example \ref{TrivialImplicialInfinitesimalGaugeTransformations}).
