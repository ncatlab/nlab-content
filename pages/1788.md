There is no direct [[natural isomorphism]] between the standard suspension (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}) and the alternative suspension (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}). This is due to the non-trivial graded commutativity ([[braiding]]) of smash products of spheres. (We discuss braiding of the smash product more in detail in [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1-2|Part 1.2]], [this example](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#PointedTopologicalSpacesWithSmashIsSymmetricMonoidalCategory)). 

Namely a [[natural isomorphism]] $\phi \colon \Sigma X \longrightarrow X \wedge S^1$ (or alternatively the other way around) would have to make the following diagrams commute:

$$
  \array{
     S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n 
       &\overset{id_{S^1} \wedge \phi_n}{\longrightarrow}& 
     S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{S^1 \wedge \sigma_n}}\downarrow 
       &(nc)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n \wedge S^1}}
     \\
     S^1 \wedge X_{n+1} 
       &\underset{\phi_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& 
     X_{n+1} \wedge S^1
  }
$$

and [[natural transformation|naturally]] so in $X$.

The only evident option is to have $\phi$ be the [[braiding]] homomorphisms of the [[smash product]]

$$
  \phi_n = \tau_{S^1, X_n} 
    \;\colon\; 
   S^1 \wedge X_{n} 
     \overset{\simeq}{\to}
   X_{n} \wedge S^1
  \,.
$$

It may superficially look like this makes the above diagram commute, but it does not. To make this explicit, consider labeling the two copies of the circle appearing here as $S^1_a$ and $S^1_b$. Then the diagram we are dealing with looks like this:

$$
  \array{
     S_a^1 \wedge S_b^1 \wedge X_n 
       &\longrightarrow& 
     S_a^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S_b^1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{S^1_a \wedge \sigma_n}}\downarrow 
       &(nc)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n \wedge S^1_b}}
     \\
     S_a^1 \wedge X_{n+1} &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1} \wedge S_b^1
  }
$$

If we had $S^1_a \wedge \sigma_n$ on the left and $\sigma_n \wedge S^1_a$ on the right, then the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the [[braiding]] would indeed give a commuting diagram. But since this is not the case, the only way to achieve this would be by exchanging in the top left

$$
  S^1_a \wedge S^1_b \longrightarrow S^1_b \wedge S^1_a
  \,.
$$

However, this map is non-trivial. It represents $-1$ in $[S^2, S^2]_\ast = \pi_2(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$. Hence inserting this map in the top of the previous diagram still does not make it commute.

But this technical problem points to its own solutions: if we were to restrict to spectra which had structure maps only of the form $S^2 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+2}$, then the braiding required to make the two models of suspension comparable would be

$$
  S^2_a \wedge S^1_b \longrightarrow S^1_b \wedge S^2_a
$$

and this map is indeed trivial. This we turn to in def. \ref{SequentialS2Spectra} below. More generally, the kind of issue encountered here is taken care of by the concept of [[symmetric spectra]], to which we turn [further below](#SymmetricSpectra).
