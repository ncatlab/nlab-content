1. each $l_n$ is graded antisymmetric, in that for every [[permutation]] $\sigma$ and homogeneously graded elements $v_i \in V_{\vert v_i \vert}$ then

   $$
     l_n(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)},\cdots ,v_{\sigma(n)}) 
     = 
     \chi(\sigma,v_1,\cdots, v_n) \cdot l_n(v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n)
   $$
