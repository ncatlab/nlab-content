**Proper Orbifold Cohomotopy for M-Theory**

M-theory folklore has it
that all quasi-realistic QCD-like physics is realized 
(and thereby non-perturbatively completed) 
at or inside super-spacetime orbi-singularities 
of intersecting black M5/M2-branes
whose magnetic flux threads an 
ambient smooth G-structured bulk spacetime
subject to a long list of subtle
differential- and algebro-topological 
constraints.

Despite an intriguing web of 
plausibility arguments and consistency checks 
that have been amassed since 
this picture emerged in the "second superstring revolution",
it has remained unclear, and largely unexplored, 
what any of this really means mathematically 
-- notably what putative M-theory on fluxed and G-structured super-orbifold spacetimes actually predicts, with any certainty, for observable physics -- 
be it in its application to 
confined hadronic matter (holographic QCD), or 
to quantum-supreme solid states (holographic CMT), 
not to speak of the more traditional but less 
tangible application to quantum gravity.

The issue with the mathematical foundations of M-theory (formerly known as string theory) had been prophesized early on: "String theory at its finest should be a new branch of geometry $[\ldots]$ developed in the twenty-first or twenty-second century $[\ldots]$ that fell by chance into the twentieth century" -- [E. Witten 1988](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Edward%20Witten#StringTheoryAtItsFinestQuote) (in [Davis & Brown, CUP 1988](https://books.google.us/books/about/Superstrings.html?id=SrSyTS4kzP8C), p. 95, 102).

Since the 21st centrury is now well on its way,
this talk surveys a new branch of mathematical geometry 
which has emerged over the last years, in joint work with Hisham Sati, 
and which *provably* exhibits a fair number of the subtle phenomena expected in M-theory on fluxed orbifold spacetimes: This
"*differential cohomotopy in a singular-cohesive $\infty$-topos*" ([[schreiber:Proper Orbifold Cohomology|arXiv:2008.01101]]) operates close to novel homotopy-theoretic foundations for mathematics itself ([[nLab:modal homotopy type theory]]) and provides a rigorous but charmingly intuitive axiomatics of geometric qualities that transparently controls construction and classification of elaborate geometric entities such as the twisted equivariant differential generalized cohomology of G-structured super-orbifolds in which gives mathematical meaning to quantized M-brane charges and C-field fluxes.

Evidence for the "[[schreiber:Hypothesis H|Hypothesis H]]" that this new geometry *is* part of the missing mathematical foundations of M-theory is further discussed in the lecture by Hisham Sati in the school the week before this conference.
