###### Definition

Let $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ be a [[smooth vector bundle]] over a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. On its [[real vector space]] $\Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ [[space of sections|of smooth sections]] consider the [[seminorms]] indexed by a [[compact subset]] $K \subset \Sigma$ and a [[natural number]] $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and given by

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma_\Sigma^\infty(E) &\overset{p_K^N}{\longrightarrow}&
    [0,\infty)
    \\
    \Phi &\mapsto&  \underset{n \leq N}{max} \underset{x \in K}{sup} {\vert \nabla^n \Phi(x)\vert}
  }
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[absolute values]] of the [[covariant derivatives]] of $\Phi$ for any fixed choice of [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on $E$ and [[norm]] on the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] $(T^\ast \Sigma)^{\otimes_\Sigma^n} \otimes_\Sigma E $.

This makes $\Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ a [[Fréchet space|Fréchet]] [[topological vector space]].

We consider the subspaces 

$$
  \Gamma_{\Sigma,sup}(E) \hookrightarrow \Gamma_\Sigma(E)
$$ 

of sections with presribed support from def. \ref{CompactlySourceCausalSupport} with the induced [[subspace topology]], which makes these, too, be [[Fréchet space|Fréchet]] [[topological vector spaces]].
