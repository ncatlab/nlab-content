[Goldblatt1984](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Bibliography#Goldblatt1984)

_Eric_: I removed the space between "Goldblatt" and "1984" so that the url looks more intuitive, i.e. does not have "%20" for the space.

Let's try a redirect

[[nitwits]]

It works! Let's try a second redirect to the same page

[[nincompoops]]

+-- {: .query}
OK, so for a while `[[nitwits]]` above actually linked to [[nitwit]].  But I was unable to actually get a hold of [[nitwits]] itself in any way!  <http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nitwit> redirected me to <http://ncatlab.org/nlab/new/nitwit>, where there was no content, and <http://ncatlab.org/nlab/edit/nitwit> sent me to the [[HomePage]].  All of this is the behaviour appropriate if [[nitwits]] simply didn\'t exist ... yet something was happening, by the link here.

Now I\'ve (re?)-created [[nitwits]] with redirect content, but that doesn\'t seem to work; is it off again, or did I type it wrong?

Hi Toby. We are discussing this with Jacques over at [Musings](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001083.html#c024203). The user manual confused me, but I think I get it now. It is different than Mediawiki, but probably better once we get the hang of it. - Eric

Update: Omigosh, I see how it works ... it\'s backwards!
=--

I was able to move [[∞-category]] to [[temp]] and fix it so that it redirects properly to [[infinity-category]].  This is not really ideal; there was edit history at [[∞-category]] which is now at [[tmp]] (see below for why); although it is not important, some redirect pages\' is.

Then I moved [[temp]] to [[tmp]] and moved [[$\infty$-category]] to [[temp]] ---but that failed!  The content and history (such as it is) is now duplicated between [[$\infty$-category]] and [[temp]].  I also managed to duplicate [[$n$-category]] at [[temporary]].  So still a few bugs in the system ... wait, no, now it works!  The problem is that <http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%24%5Cinfty%24-category> is not redirecting to <http://ncatlab.org/nlab/new/%24%5Cinfty%24-category> as it should for a nonexistent page.

OK, well, this will work fine for moving pages and creating new redirects for existing pages.  It won\'t work for combining pages (which is rare) or for regularising current redirect pages.  (I mean, I did regularise some ... but only by creating extra pages with nonsense names and hiding the edit history.)  Ultimately, there is no way to reduce the number of pages with current content except by reducing the number of pages with edit history (that is, by deleting them).

:   Second definition for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
    because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2

:   This definition has a code block, a blockquote and a list.

You can make abbreviations. Here I'm going to make an abbreviation for the n-category cafe: 

*[nCat]: n-category cafe
Is this a new line?

Now apparently I just type nCat and it should output "n-category cafe". Did it work?  No!

Trying theorem numbering:

###### Theorem
**(Lagrange's Theorem)**. Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $H$
be a subgroup of $G$. Then the order of $H$ divides the order of
$G$.

By Theorem \ref{Lagrange}, we know that the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

Nor can you put it inside links: [[$\infty$-category]].
But you can put it inside *some* markup, such as boldface: **I love $\infty$-categories!!!**
I don\'t know what makes the difference.

We can put in a table, which is a block-level HTML construct, like this, remembering to separate it by blank lines top and bottom:

<table>
<tr><td>Foo</td></tr>

But we can't put in an iframe like this:

Many spaces that occur in mathematics aren't manifolds but one would like to be able to treat them as if they were manifolds; in particular, they should have some *smooth* structure that goes beyond mere topology.  By considering examples of these spaces and by considering what specifically one would like to do with or to them, it is possible to generalise the idea of a smooth manifold to encompass the new examples whilst preserving enough structure to retain the old tools.  There have been several such generalisations in recent mathematical history.  A (partial) list is below.
