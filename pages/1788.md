By the discussion in _[Differential forms](#DifferentialForms)_ and _[Principal connections](#PrincipalConnections)_, [[differential forms]] and more generally [[connection on a bundle|connections]] may be regarded as [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] [[measures]] of _change_, of _displacement_. The discussion in _[Differentiation](#Differentiation)_ showed how to extract from a _finite_ but [[cohesion|cohesive]] (e.g. smoothly continuous) displacement all its infinitesimal measures of displacements by [[differentiation]]. 

Here we discuss the reverse operation: _[[integration]]_ is a construction from a [[differential form]] of the corresponding finite cohesive displacement. More generally this applies to any [[connection on a bundle|connection]] and is then called the _[[nLab:parallel transport]]_ of the connection, a term again referring to the idea that a finite [Sentimancho](http://www.seosentimental.org/) displacement proceeds pointwise in parallel to a given infinitesimal displacement.

Under good conditions this construction can proceed literally by "adding up all the infinitesimal contributions" and therefore [[integration]] is traditionally thought of as a generalization of forming [[sums]]. Therefore one has the notation "$\int_{\Sigma} \omega$"
for the [[integral]] of a [[differential form]] $\omega$ over a space $\Sigma$, as a variant of the notation "$\sum_{S} f$" for the [[sum]] of values of a [[function]] on a [[set]] $S$. For the case of integrals of connections the corresponding parallel transport expression is often denoted by an exponentiated integral sign "$\mathcal{P} \exp(\int_\Sigma \omega)$", referring to the fact that the passage from infinitesimal to finite quantities involves also the passage from [[Lie algebra]] data to [[Lie group]] data ("[[Lie integration|exponentiated Lie algebra data]]"). 

However, both from the point of view of [[gauge theory]] [[physics]] as well as from the [[general abstract]] perspective of [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] another characterization of integration is more fundamental: the [[integral]] $\int_\Sigma \omega$ of a [[differential form]] $\omega$ (or more generally of a [[circle n-bundle with connection|connection]]) is an [[invariant]] under those [[gauge transformations]] of $\omega$ that are trivial on the [[boundary]] of $\Sigma$, and it is the _[[universal construction|universal]]_ such invariant, hence is uniquely characterized by this property.

In traditional accounts this fact is referred to via the _[[Stokes theorem]]_ and its generalizations (such as the [[nonabelian Stokes theorem]]), which says that the [[integral]]/[[parallel transport]] is indeed _[[invariant]]_ under gauge transformations of differential forms/connections. That this invariance actually characterizes the integral and the parallel transport is rarely highlighted in traditional texts, but it is implicit for instance in the old "path method" of [[Lie integration]] (discussed below in _[Lie integration](#LieIntegration)_) as well as in the famous characterization of [[flat connections]], discussed above in _[Flat 1-connections](#Flat1Connections)_: 

for $X$ a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[manifold]] and for $G$ a [[Lie group]], the operation of sending a [[flat connection|flat]] $G$-[[principal connection]] $\nabla$ to its [[parallel transport]] $\gamma \mapsto hol_{\gamma}(\nabla)$ around [[loops]] $\gamma\colon S^1 \to X$, hence to the [[integral]] of the connection around all possible loops (its [[holonomy]]),  for any fixed basepoint

$$
  hol \coloneqq \mathcal{P} \exp(\int_{(-)} (-)) 
  \;\colon\; 
  H^1_{conn, flat}(X,G) 
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} 
  Hom_{Grp}(\pi_1(X) , G)/G
$$

exhibits a [[bijection]] between gauge  [[equivalence classes]] of connections and [[group]] homomorphisms from the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ of $X$ to the [[gauge group]] $G$ (modulo [[adjoint action|adjoint]] $G$-action from gauge transformations at the base point, hence at the integration boundary). This is traditionally regarded as a property of the definition of the [[parallel transport]] $\mathcal{P} \exp(\int_{(-)}(-))$ by [[integration]]. But being a [[bijection]], we may read this fact the other way round: it says that forming equivalence classes of flat $G$-connections is a way of computing their [[integral]]/[[parallel transport]]. 

We saw a generalization of this fact to non-closed forms and non-flat connections already in the discussion at _[Differential 1-forms as smooth incremental path measures](##1FormsAsSmoothFunctors)_, where gauge equivalence classes of differential forms are shown to be equivalently assignments of [[parallel transport]] to [[path groupoid|smooth paths]].

This is also implied by the above discussion: for $\nabla \in H^1_{conn}(X,G) $ any non-flat connection and $\gamma \colon S^1 \to X$ a trajectory in $X$, we may form the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] of $\nabla$ to $S^1$. There it becomes a necessarily flat connection $\gamma^* \nabla \in H^1_{conn, flat}(S^1,G)$, since the [[curvature]] [[differential 2-form]] necessarily vanishes on the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifold]] $S^1$. Accordingly, by the above bijection, forming the gauge [[equivalence class]] of $\gamma^* \nabla$ means to find a group homomorphism

$$
  \mathbb{Z} \simeq \pi_1(S^1) \to G
$$  

modulo conjugation (modulo nothing if $G$ is [[abelian group|abelian]], such as $G = U(1)$) and since $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[free group]] on a single generator this is the same as finding an element 

$$
  hol_\gamma(\nabla)
  = 
  \mathcal{P} \exp(\int_\gamma \gamma^*\nabla)
  \in 
  G
  \,.
$$

This total operation of first pulling back the connection and then forming its [[integration]] (by taking gauge equivalence classes) is called the _[[transgression]]_ of the original 1-form connection on $X$ to a 0-form connection on the [[loop space]] $[S^1,X]$.

Below in the [Model Layer](#IntegrationModelLayer) we discuss the classical examples of [[integration]]/[[parallel transport]] and their various generalizations in detail. Then in the [Semantic Layer](#IntegrationSemanticLayer) we show how indeed all these constructions are obtained forming [[equivalence classes]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids|smooth homotopy types]], hence by _[[truncated object in an (∞,1)-category|truncation]]_ (followed, to obtain the correct cohesive structure, by _concretification_, def. \ref{ConcreteObjectsAndConcretification}).
