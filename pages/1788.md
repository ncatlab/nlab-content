### Basic reading

For **Prelude) Classical homotopy theory** 

A concise and yet comprehensive and self-contained re-write of the proof ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)) of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] is in

* {#Hirschhorn15} [[Philip Hirschhorn]], _The Quillen model category of topological spaces_ ([arXiv:1508.01942](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01942)).

For general [[model category]] theory a decent concise account is in

* {#DwyerSpalinski95} [[William Dwyer]], J. Spalinski, _[[Homotopy theories and model categories]]_ ([pdf](http://folk.uio.no/paularne/SUPh05/DS.pdf)) in [[Ioan Mackenzie James]] (ed.), _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_ 1995

For the restriction to the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient category]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] good sources are

* {#Lewis78} [[Gaunce Lewis]], _Compactly generated spaces_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/GaunceApp.pdf)), appendix A of _The Stable Category and Generalized Thom Spectra_ PhD thesis Chicago, 1978

* {#Strickland09} [[Neil Strickland]], _The category of CGWH spaces_, 2009 ([pdf](http://neil-strickland.staff.shef.ac.uk/courses/homotopy/cgwh.pdf))

For section **1) Stable homotopy theory** we follow the modern picture of the stable homotopy category for which an enjoyable quick survey may be found in

* {#Malkiewich14} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _The stable homotopy category_, 2014 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/stable.pdf)).

The classical account in ([Adams 74, part III sections 2, 4-7](#Adams74)) is still a good read (but ignore the "[[Adams category]]"-construction of the [[stable homotopy category]] in sections III.2 and III.3). What we actually do follows 

* {#MMSS00} [[Michael Mandell]], [[Peter May]], [[Stefan Schwede]], [[Brooke Shipley]], _[[Model categories of diagram spectra]]_, Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, 82 (2001), 441-512 ([pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/PAPERS/mmssLMSDec30.pdf))

For the discussion of [[ring spectra]] we pass to [[symmetric spectra]] and [[orthogonal spectra]]. A comprehensive and account of the former is in

* {#Schwede12} [[Stefan Schwede]], _[[Symmetric spectra]]_, 2012 ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/~schwede/SymSpec-v3.pdf))


For **Interlude: Spectral sequences** a discussion streamlined for our purposes is in ([Rognes 12, section 2](#Rognes12)).

In **2) Adams spectral sequence** for the general theory we follow ([Hopkins 99, section 5](#Hopkins99)) as worked out in

* {#Aramian} [[Nersés Aramian]], _The Adams spectral sequence_ ([[AramianANSS.pdf:file]])

and we take some further clues from ([Adams 74, III.15](#Adams74)).

For the special case of the classical Adams spectral sequence a comprehensive survey is in 

* {#Bruner09} [[Robert Bruner]], _An Adams spectral sequence primer_, 2009 ([pdf](http://www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/papers/adams.pdf))

For the **Seminar on Complex oriented cohomology** an excellent textbook to hold on to is

* {#Kochman96} [[Stanley Kochman]], chapters I - IV of _[[Bordism, Stable Homotopy and Adams Spectral Sequences]]_, AMS 1996

While this gives detailed proofs, some standard steps used are made more explicit for instance in 

* {#Switzer75} [[Robert Switzer]], _Algebraic Topology - Homotopy and Homology_, Die  Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften in Einzeldarstellungen, Vol. 212, Springer-Verlag, New York, N. Y., 1975. 


Specifically for **S.1) Generalized cohomology** a neat account is in:

* {#AguilarGitlerPrieto02} Marcelo Aguilar, [[Samuel Gitler]], Carlos Prieto, section 12 of _Algebraic topology from a homotopical viewpoint_, Springer (2002) ([toc pdf](http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/106999419.pdf))


For **S.2) Cobordism theory** an efficient collection of the highlights is in

* {#Malkiewich11} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _Unoriented cobordism and $M O$_, 2011 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/cobordism.pdf))

except that it omits proof of the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]/[[Serre spectral sequence]] and that of the [[Thom isomorphism]], but see the references there and see ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96), [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 11.7](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)) for details.
 
For **S.3) Complex oriented cohomology** besides ([Kochman 96, chapter 4](#Kochman96)) have a look at part II of 

* {#Adams74} [[Frank Adams]], _[[Stable homotopy and generalized homology]]_, Chicago Lectures in mathematics, 1974

and

* {#Lurie10} [[Jacob Lurie]], lectures 1-10 of _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010

(These overlap, pick the one that seems more inviting on first reading.)

are still an excellent source. For further reading on homotopy theory and stable homotopy theory a useful collection is

The modern chromatic picture originates around

a useful survey is in

* {#Wilson13} [[Dylan Wilson]] section 1.2 of _Spectral Sequences from Sequences of Spectra: Towards the Spectrum of the Category of Spectra_ lecture at _[2013 Pre-Talbot Seminar](http://math.harvard.edu/~hirolee/pretalbot2013/)_, March 2013 ([[DylanWilsonOnANSS.pdf:file]])
