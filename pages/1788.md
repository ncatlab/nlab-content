Making the _implicit_ [[infinitesimal gauge transformations]] form def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry} explicit means to consider the
infinitesimal [[homotopy quotient]] of their [[action]] on the [[field bundle]],
represented by their [[action Lie algebroid]]. The ("[[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra|Chevalley-Eilenberg]]"-)algebra
of functions on this "field bundle with infinitesimal gauge symmetries made explicit" is called the _[[BRST complex]]_.
In it the formerly _implicit_ infinitesimal gauge symmetries appear _explicitly_ in the guise of [[field (physics)|field]] variables
of positive grading in a [[differential graded-commutative algebra]]. These are called _[[gauge fields]]_.

###### Definition
**(infinitesimal [[derived Lie algebroid]])**

Let $X$ be an [[infinitesimally thickened point]] and write $C^\infty(X)$ for its [[algebra of functions]].
Then  a _connected [[Lie ∞-algebroid]]_ $\mathfrak{a}$ over $X$ of [[finite type]] is a

1. a sequence $(\mathfrak{a}_k)_{ k = 1 }^\infty$ of [[free modules]] of [[finite number|finite]] [[rank]] over $C^\infty(X)$, hence a
   [[graded module]] $\mathfrak{a}_\bullet$ in degrees $k \in \mathbb{N}$; $k \geq 1$

1. a [[differential]] $d_{CE}$ that makes the [[graded-commutative algebra]] $Sym_{C^\infty(X)}(\mathfrak{a}^\ast_\bullet)$
   into a cochain [[differential graded-commutative algebra]] (hence with $d_{CE}$ of degree +1) over $\mathbb{R}$
   (not necessarily over $C^\infty(X)$), to be called the _[[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]_ of $\mathfrak{a}$:

   $$
     CE(\mathfrak{a})
      \;\coloneqq\;
     \left(
       Sym_{C^\infty(X)}(\mathfrak{a}^\ast_\bullet)
       \,,\,
       d_{CE}
     \right)
     \,.
   $$

If we allow $\mathfrak{a}_\bullet$ to also have terms in non-positive degree, then we speak of a _[[derived Lie algebroid]]_.

With $C^\infty(X)$ canonically itself regarded as a [[dgc-algebra]], there is a canonical
dg-algebra homomorphism

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{a}) \longrightarrow C^\infty(X)
$$

which is the identity on $C^\infty(X)$ and zero on $\mathfrak{a}^\ast_{\neq 0}$.

###### Example
**(basic examples of [[Lie algebroids]])

Two basic examples of [[Lie algebroids]] are:

1. For $X$ any [[smooth manifold]], then setting $\mathfrak{a}_{\neq 0 } \coloneqq 0$ and $d_{CE} \coloneqq 0$
   makes it a Lie algebroid.

1. For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] [[Lie algebra]]
   we obtain a Lie algebroid denoted $\ast/\mathfrak{g}$ or $B \mathfrak{g}$ by taking the base manifold
   to be the point, taking $\mmathfrak{a}$ to be concentrated in degree 1 on $\mathfrak{g}$, and
   taking the differential to be given by the linear dual of the [[Lie bracket]]

   $$
     d_{CE} \;\colon\; \mathfrak{g}^\ast \overset{[-,-]^\ast}{\longrightarrow} \mathfrak{g}^\ast \wedge \mathfrak{g}^\ast
     \,.
   $$

   If $(t_\alpha)$ is a [[linear basis]] for $\mathfrak{g}$ and $(t^\alpha)$ a corresponding dual basis for $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$,
   then this is given by

   $$
     d_{CE} t^\alpha -\tfrac{1}{2} C^\alpha_{\beta \gamma} t^\beta \wedge t^\gamma
     \,,
   $$

   where on the right we have the structure constants of the [[Lie bracket]] in this basis:

   $$
     [t^\beta, t^\gamma] = t_\alpha C^\alpha{}_{\beta \gamma}
     \,.
   $$

   The resulting [[dgc-algebra]]

   $$
     \left(
       \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^\ast, d_{CE} = [-,-]^\ast
     \right)
   $$

   is the standard [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] from basic [[Lie theory]], whence the name of the general concept.


=--

The two basic examples \ref{BasicExamplesOfLieAlgebroids} are unified by the following example,
which is the one of central relevance for the discussion of [[gauge theory]]:

+-- {: .num_example #ActionLieAlgebroid}
###### Example
**([[action Lie algebroid]])**

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] , let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a [[Lie algebra]] equipped with an
[[action]] on $X$ by [[infinitesimal]] [[diffeomorphisms]], hence equipped with a [[homomorphism]]
of Lie algebras

$$
  \rho \;\colon \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow ( Vect(X), [-,-] )
$$

to the smooth [[vector fields]] on $X$.

Then there is the _[[action Lie algebroid]]_ $X/\mathfrak{g}$ whose underlying space is $X$;
whose $C^\infty(X)$-module is concentrated in degree 1 on the [[free module]] $C^\infty(X) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathfrak{g}$
and whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra|CE-differential]] is given

* on functions $f \in C^\infty(X)$ by the Lie algebra action

  $$
    d_{CE} f \coloneqq \rho(-)(f) \in C^\infty(X) \otimes \mathfrak{g}^\ast
  $$

* on dual Lie algebra elements $\omega \in \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ by the [[linear dual]] of the [[Lie bracket]]

  $$
    d_{CE} \omega \coloneqq \omega([-,-]) \;\in \; \mathfrak{g}^\ast \wedge \mathfrak{g}^\ast
    \,.
  $$

In terms of [[coordinates]] this means the following. Assume that $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[Cartesian space]]
with coordinates $(\phi^a)$ and let $\{t_\alpha\}$ be a [[linear basis]] for $\mathfrak{g}$
with dual basis $(c^\alpha)$ for $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$. Then the
Lie action has components

$$
  d_{CE} \phi^a = \rho^{a}_{\alpha} c^\alpha
$$

$$
  d_{CE} c^\alpha = -\tfrac{1}{2} C^\alpha{}_{\beta \gamma} c^\beta \wedge c^\gamma
$$

where on the right we have the structure constants of the Lie algebra in this basis:

$$
  [t_\beta, t_\gamma] = C^\alpha{}_{\beta \gamma} t_\alpha
  \,.
$$

That the differential $d_{CE}$ thus defined indeed squares to 0 is

* in degree 0 the action property: $\rho([t, t']) = [\rho(t), \rho(t')]$

* in degree 1 the [[Jacobi identity]].

###### Definition

Given two [[derived Lie algebroids]] $\mathfrak{a}$, $\mathfrak{a}'$, then a [[homomorphism]]
between them

$$
  f \;\colon\; \mathfrak{a} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{a}'

###### Example
**([[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]] [[functions]] in terms of [[Lie algebroids]])

Let $X/\mathfrak{g}$ be an [[action Lie algebroid]] (example \ref{ActionLieAlgebroid})
and regard the[[real line]] $\mathbb{R}^1$ as a Lie algebroid by example \ref{BasicExamplesOfLieAlgebroids}.
Then homomorphisms of Lie algebroids (def. \ref{HomomorphismBetweenLieAlgebroids}) of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; X/\mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1
  \,,
$$

hence _smooth functions on the Lie algebroid_, are equivalently

* ordinary [[smooth functions]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1$ on the underlying [[smooth manifold]],

* which are [[invariant]] under the Lie action in that $\rho(-)(f) = 0$.

=--


Given a [[derived Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{a}$, its [[Weil algebra]] is

$$
  W(\mathfrak{a})
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left(
    Sym_{C^\infty(X)}( \Gamma(T^\ast X) \oplus \mathfrak{a}_\bullet \oplus \mathfrak{a}[1]_\bullet )
     \;,\;
    \mathbf{d}_W \coloneqq d_{CE} + \mathbf{d}
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbf{d}$ acts as the de Rham differential $\mathbf{d} \colon C^\infty(X) \to \Gamma(T^\ast X)$
on functions, and as the degree shift operator $\mathbf{d} \colon \mathfrak{a}_\bullet \to \mathfrak{a}[1]_\bullet$
on the graded elements.

$\,$

Let $(E,\mathbf{L})$ be a [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
whose [[field bundle]] $E$ is a [[trivial vector bundle]] (example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) and whose [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}$ is spacetime-independent (example \ref{ShellForSpacetimeIndependentLagrangians}).
Let $\Sigma \times \{\varphi\} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ be a constant section of the shell .

Let $(J^\infty_\Sigma (E,\varphi))_{BRST}$ with

$$
  C^\infty\left(
     (J^\infty_\Sigma (E,\varphi))_{BRST}
 \right)
   =
 \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\phi)_{BRST}
$$

be an [[L-∞ algebroid]] on $\Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\phi)$ such that the Lagrangian function is invariant, hence a morphism
of $L_\infty$-algebroids of the form

$$
  (J^\infty_\Sigma (E,\varphi))_{BRST}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}
$$

which means that

$$
  L \;\in\; \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\phi)_{BRST}
$$

is closed $d_{CE} L = 0$. We say now that the  $\mathfrak{a}_1$ are
_explicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetries]]_ of $L$ (and $\mathfrak{a}_{\geq 2}$ are the [[higher gauge transformation|higher]] such)

We say that functions on the [[derived Lie algebroid]] which is
the [[derived critical locus]] of $L$ is the _derived shell_ (or something like this)
and that its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is the
_local [[BV-BRST complex]]_ of the system:

$$
  \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\phi)_{BRST}\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}}
$$

In the special case that there are no explicit infinitesimal gauge symmetries
this reduces to the plain local [[BV-complex]] from def. \ref{BVComplexOfOrdinaryLagrangianDensity}.

On the [[Weil algebra]] we need to re-introduce the [[variational bicomplex]] structure.

The full de Rham differential on the derived critical locus is


$$
  \mathbf{d}_W = \mathbf{d} + s_{\text{BV-BRST}}
$$

and we need to re-state what counts as a horizontal differential now. Take it to be

$$
  d_W \coloneqq d - s_{BV}
$$

where $d = d x^\mu \frac{d}{d x^\mu}$ is the original total horizontal differential.

The cohomology of $d_W$ is called _[[local BV-BRST cohomology]]_.

Then a local observable $A \in \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E)\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}}$
is derived-horizontally closed, $d_W A = 0$, if $s_{\text{BV-BRST}} A = 0$.

$$
  \array{
    \{s_{\text{BV-BRST}}(A)  \}
    \\
    {\mathllap{s_{\text{BV-BRST}}}}\uparrow
    \\
    \{A\} &\underset{d\vert_{\Omega^{p+1,1}_\Sigma} = 0}{\longrightarrow}& 0
  }
$$

Such $A$ is exact $d_W$-exact if it is a sum of a term that vanishes on-shell and a horizontally exact term.

Hence if we now define the local observables to be the horizontal cohomology,
we get precisely the gauge-invariant on-shell local observables.


+-- {: .num_prop #dWCohomology}
###### Proposition
**($d_W$-cohomology)**

The $d_W$-closed elements in degree $(p,0)$ are precisely pairs $(v,J_v)$
consisting of an implicit infinitesimal local gauge symmetry $v$ and a conserved current $J_v$ for it.

The $d_W$-exact elements in this degree are sums of

1. $d$-exact currents;

1. on-shell vanishing implicit gauge transformations;

1. on-shell vanishing currents with their horizontally exact gauge transformations


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The $d_W$-closed element are
the implicit infinitesimal gauge symmetries $v$ regarded as an [[antifield]] $v^a \overline{\phi}_a$
multiplied with the [[volume form]] $dvol_\Sigma$
together with their Noether current $J_v \in \Omega^{p,0}_\Sigma(E)$ (prop. \ref{NoethersFirstTheorem})


$$
  \array{
    \{J_v\} &\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}& \{ \overset{= 0}{\overbrace{ d J_v - \iota_v \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} }} \}
    \\
    && \uparrow\mathrlap{s_{BV}}
    \\
    && \{ v^a \overline{\phi}_a dvol_\Sigma\}
  }
$$



Such a pair is exact if

$$
  \array{
    \{K\}
     &\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}&
    \{ d K + v^{a \mu} \frac{\delta_{EL}L}{\delta \phi^a} \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma   \} &\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}& \{ \overset{= 0}{\overbrace{ d J_v - \iota_v \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} }} \}
    \\
    && \mathllap{s_{BV}}\uparrow && \uparrow\mathrlap{s_{BV}}
    \\
    && v^{a \mu} \overline{\phi}_a \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
      &\underset{-d}{\longrightarrow}&
    \{ v^a \overline{\phi}_a dvol_\Sigma\}
    \\
    && && \uparrow\mathrlap{s_{BV}}
    \\
    &&
    && \kappa^{a b } \overline{\phi}_a \overline{\phi}_b dvol_\Sigma
  }
$$

(...)

=--




So now we define, in analogy to what we did in the underived case, the derived vertical derivative to be what
remains of the [[Weil algebra]] derivative once we subtract the derived horizontal derivative:

$$
  \delta_W \coloneqq \mathbf{d}_W - d_W
  \,.
$$

This way now the local [[BV-BRST complex]] given as the [[derived critical locus]]
of the BRST complex gets a bigrading: the "derived variational bicomplex" or something.

###### Example
**(gauge symmetries modulo EOMs are $d_W$-exact)


An  [[infinitesimal gauge symmetry]] $v_\epsilon$  of [[gauge parameter]] $(\epsilon^\alpha)$ is a vector field on the jet bundle with components of the form

$$
  \mathcal{L}_{v_\epsilon} \phi^a
   \;\coloneqq\;
  R^a_\alpha \epsilon^\alpha
    +
  R^{a \mu}_\alpha \frac{d \epsilon^\alpha}{d x^\mu}
$$

such that this is an [[infinitesimal symmetry of the Lagrangian]] in that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \iota_{v_\epsilon} \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}
    & =
    v^a \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a} dvol_\Sigma
    \\
    & =
    \epsilon^\alpha
    \left(
       R^a_\alpha \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{ \delta \phi^a}
       -
       \frac{d}{d x^\mu}
       \left(
          R^{a \mu}_\alpha \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a}
       \right)
    \right)
    dvol_\Sigma
    +
    d\left(
       \epsilon^\alpha R^{a \mu}_\alpha \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a}
    \right)
    \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
    \\
    & =
    0 + d(...)
  \end{aligned}
$$

for all $(\epsilon^\alpha)$.

The corresponding [[antighosts]] $\overline{c}_\alpha$ are taken by the BV-BRST differential to the antifield-preimage of the term on the left:

$$
  s\left(\overline{c}_\alpha\right)
  \;=\;
  R^a_\alpha \overline{\phi}_a
  -
  \frac{d}{d x^\mu}
  \left(
    R^{a \mu}_\alpha \overline{\phi}_a
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, an [[on-shell]] vanishing [[infinitesimal symmetry of the Lagrangian]] is a vector field with components of the form

$$
  \kappa^{a b} \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a}
$$

for $\kappa^{a b} = - \kappa^{b a}$ a skew-symmetric system of smooth functions on the jet bundle.

The linear combination of such an infinitesimal gauge symmetry and an on-shell vanishing infinitesimal symmetry is $(s+d)$-exact:


$$
  \begin{aligned}
    v^a dvol_\Sigma
    & =
    \left(
      R^a_\alpha \epsilon^\alpha
      +
      R^{a \mu}_\alpha \frac{d \epsilon^\alpha}{d x^\mu}
      +
      \kappa^{a b} \frac{\delta_{EL} L }{ \delta \phi^a }
    \right)
    dvol_\Sigma
    \\
    & =
    s
    \left(
      \epsilon^\alpha \overline{c}_\alpha
      -
      \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa^{a b} \overline{\phi}_a \overline{\phi}_b
    \right) dvol_\sigma
    +
    d\left(
      \epsilon^\alpha R^{a \mu}_\alpha
    \right)
    \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
  \end{aligned}
$$

([Barnich-Brandt-Henneaux 94, p. 20](#BarnichBrandtHenneaux94))


It may be useful to organize this expression into the $s+d$-[[bicomplex]] like so:

$$
  \array{
    \{K\}
     &\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}&
     \{ d K
       +
     \epsilon^\alpha R^{a \mu}_\alpha \frac{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}}{ \delta \phi^a}
     \}

    \{ \overset{= 0}{\overbrace{ d J_v - \iota_v \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} }} \}
    \\
    && \mathllap{s}\uparrow && \uparrow\mathrlap{-s}
    \\
    &&
    \epsilon^\alpha R^{a \mu}_\alpha \overline{\phi}_a
    \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
      &\underset{d}{\longrightarrow}&
    \left\{
      d\left(
        \epsilon^\alpha R^{a \mu}_\alpha \overline{\phi}_a
      \right)
      \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
      +
      \left(
        R^a_\alpha \epsilon^\alpha
        +
        R^{a \mu}_\alpha \frac{d \epsilon^\alpha}{d x^\mu}
        +
        \kappa^{a b} \frac{\delta_{EL} L }{ \delta \phi^a }
      \right)
      \overline{\phi}_a
      \,
      dvol_\Sigma
    \right\}
    \\
    && && \uparrow\mathrlap{-s}
    \\
    &&
    &&
    \left(
       - \epsilon^\alpha \overline{c}_\alpha
       +
      \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa^{a b } \overline{\phi}_a \overline{\phi}_b
    \right)
    dvol_\Sigma
  }
$$

But beware that this uses a convenient abuse of notation: A horizontal derivative of an antifield, such as

$$
  d( b^\mu \overline{\phi}_a ) \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
$$

which looks like it should be taken by the BV-BRST differential $s$ to

$$
  - d( b^\mu \frac{\delta_{El} L}{\delta \phi^a} ) \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
$$

should rather be regarded as shorthand for the element

$$
  ( b^\mu \frac{\delta_{El} L}{\delta \phi^a} ) \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
$$

which is taken by the horizontal differential $d$ to the same expression. This way no horizontal derivatives of antifields apear as actual coordinate functions: the antifields are the coordinates not on the full [[tangent bundle]] of the [[jet bundle]], but just on the bundle of [[evolutionary vector fields]], which locally are functions on the jet bundle with coefficients just the $\overline{\phi}_a$.

## Gauge fixing

In good cases the resulting combined [[BV-BRST complex]] is [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]]
to a [[derived Lie algebroid]] version of the [[shell]], degreewise compatible with
the [[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebra|local Poisson bracket]] (from prop. \ref{LocalPoissonBracket})
and degreewise admitting [[Cauchy surfaces]]. To this therefore the construction of [[covariant phase spaces]]
and then the construction of local observabes applies degree-wise.

## Quantization
 {#QuantumObservables}

Given any [[space]] with [[infinitesimal symmetries]] acting on it, there is the corresponding [[homotopy quotient]]
by these infinitesimal symmetries. For the [[covariant phase space]] of a [[Lagrangian field theory]], as [above](#PhaseSpace) with its [[Poisson Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal symmetries (def. \ref{PoissonBracketOnHamiltonianLocalObservables}),
this infinitesimal [[homotopy quotient]] is known as the _[[Poisson Lie algebroid]]_ and the corresponding genuine
[[homotopy quotient]] is known as the _[[symplectic groupoid]]_. As one passes from [[phase space]] to its [[symplectic groupoid]],
the [[algebra of functions]] on phase space -- hence the [[algebra of observables]] $Obs$ (def. \ref{LocalObservables}) -- which is always a [[commutative algebra]] _[[deformation quantization|deforms]]_ to the corresponding algebra of functions on a [[Lie groupoid]]
called the ([[polarization|polarized]]) [[convolution algebra of a Lie groupoid]]. This is now a [[non-commutative algebra]]
called the _[[algebra of quantum observables]]_ $Obs_{\hbar}$; and this passage from
[[phase space]] to its [[symplectic groupoid]] [[homotopy quotient]] by  Hamiltonian symmetries is called _[[quantization]]_
(specifically: "[[geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids]]").
Here the strength of the non-commutativity is measured by a [[deformation]] parameter called _[[Planck's constant]]_ $\hbar$.

Since the product in the [[algebra of quantum observables]] $Obs_\hbar$ differs from that in $Obs$, the
positivity condition $\langle A^\ast A\rangle \geq 0$ in the definition of  _[[states]]_ $\langle - \rangle$
of a field theory (def. \ref{States}) acquires a different meaning. The states after [[quantization]] are called
_[[quantum states]]_ and their difference witnesses that after [[quantization]] the [[Lagrangian field theory]] is of a different nature:
one says that it is no longer a _[[classical field theory]]_, but a _[[quantum field theory]]_
and that the objects whose states are expressed by these new [[quantum states]] are _[[quantum fields]]_.

Unfortunately, explicitly constructing the [[algebra of quantum observables]] of a [[Lagrangian field theory]] and hence "constructing the [[quantum field theory]]" turns out to be extremely hard, unless some simplifying assumptions are made.

One kind of simplification occurs when the  [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] is very low. For instance if the spacetime dimension is taken to be $p+1 = 1$ -- modelling the approximation where one completely ignores the variation of fields in space
and retains just their time evolution -- then one speaks of [[quantum mechanics]], which is well understood.
Another simplification occurs when the field theory is a _[[free field theory]]_, meaning that its [[equation of motion]]
is a [[normally hyperbolic differential operator|normally hyperbolic]] [[linear differential operator]].
In this case the [[quantum field theory]] is fully understood as long as the underlying [[spacetime]] is a
[[time orientation|time-orientable]] and [[globally hyperbolic spacetime|globally hyperbolic]]. But, as the
name indicates, this captures only the case where there is no [[interaction]] among the [[field (physics)|fields]].

Since the [[algebra of quantum observables]] $Obs_\hbar$ is a _[[deformation]]_ with strength $\hbar$ of the commutative algebra of classical
observables $Obs$ controlled by the [[Poisson Lie algebra]], another simplification occurs if one
gives up on the demand to understand the full deformation at finite value of [[Planck's constant]] $\hbar$
and considers just [[infinitesimal]] values of $\hbar$. Since this means that the resulting [[quantum observables]]
are no longer actual [[smooth functions]] of $\hbar$, but just _[[formal power series]]_, this is called
_[[formal deformation quantization]]_. The resulting "infinitesimally quantized" [[field theory]] is called
_[[perturbative quantum field theory]]_.

For [[interaction|interacting]] [[field theories]] in [[spacetime]] dimension $p+1 \geq 3+1$
their quantization has been constructed to date only in [[perturbation theory]] this way.
The construction of full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] (in dimension $\geq 3+1$ with
non-vanishing [[interaction]]) is, at the time of this writing, a wide open problem.

But [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is well understood. This we turn to next...
