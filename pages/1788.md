In order to see this, it is convenient to adopt the following notation: for $f \colon X \to Y$ a morphism, then we denote the collection of [[generalized element]] of its homotopy fiber as

$$
  hofib(f)
  = 
  \left\{
    (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast)
  \right\}
$$

indicating that these elements are pairs consisting of an element $x$ of $X$ and a "path" (an element of the given path space object) from $f(x)$ to the basepoint.

This way the canonical map $hofib(f) \to X$ is $(x, f(x) \rightsquigarrow \ast) \mapsto x$. Hence in this notation the homotopy fiber of the homotopy fiber reads

$$
  hofib(hofib(f))
  = 
  \left\{
    ( (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast), 
            x \overset{\gamma_2}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast  )
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This identifies with $\Omega Y$ by forming the loops

$$
  \gamma_1 \cdot f(\overline{\gamma_2})
  \,,
$$

where the overline denotes reversal and the dot denotes concatenation.

Then consider the next homotopy fiber

$$
  hofib(hofib(hofib(f)))
  =
  \left\{
    \left(
      ( (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast), x \overset{\gamma_2}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast  ),
      \left(
      \array{
         x && \overset{\gamma_3}{\rightsquigarrow} && \ast
         \\
         f(x) &&\overset{f(\gamma_3)}{\rightsquigarrow}&& \ast
         \\
         & {}_{\mathllap{\gamma_1}}\searrow & \Downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathllap{}}
         \\
         && \ast
      }    
      \right)
    \right)
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have a path in $hofib(f)$ from $(x, f(x)\overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast)$ to the basepoint element. This is a path $\gamma_3$ together with a path-of-paths $f(\gamma_3) \simeq \gamma_2$. 

By the above convention this is identified with the loop in $X$ which is

$$
  \gamma_2 \cdot (\overline{\gamma}_3)
  \,.
$$

But the map to $hofib(hofib(f))$ sends this datat to $( (x, f(x) \overset{\gamma_1}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast), x \overset{\gamma_2}{\rightsquigarrow} \ast  )$, hence to the loop

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \gamma_1 \cdot f( \overline{\gamma_2} )
    & \simeq
    f(\gamma_3) \cdot f(\overline{\gamma_2})
    \\
    & =
    f( \gamma_3 \cdot \overline{\gamma_2} )
    \\
    & =
    f ( \overline{\gamma_2 \cdot \overline{\gamma}_3} )
    \\
    & =
    \overline{f(\gamma_2 \cdot \overline{\gamma}_3) }
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

hence to the reveral of the image under $f$ of the loop in $X$.
