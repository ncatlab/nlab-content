### A first idea of quantum fields
 {#AFirstIdeaOfQuantumFields}

We introduce here the basic concepts of _[[Lagrangian field theory]]_, first for [[prequantum field theory]] and then for its [[deformation quantization]] to [[perturbative quantum field theory]].

In full beauty these concepts are extremely general; but in this section the aim is to give a first good idea of the subject, and therefore we present for the moment only a restricted setup, notably assuming that [[spacetime]] is [[Minkowski spacetime]], that the [[field bundle]] (see below) is an ordinary and [[trivial bundle|trivial]] [[fiber bundle]].

This does subsume what is considered in most traditional texts on the subject. In subsequent sections we will eventually discuss more general situations, where spacetimes is allowed to be [[globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold]] and the [[field bundle]] to be an super [[infinity-Lie algebroid]]. This is sufficient generality to capture the established perturbative [[BV formalism|BRST-BV quantization]]
of [[fermions]] coupled to [[gauge fields]] [[AQFT on curved spacetime|on curved spacetimes]].
Further generalization, necessary for the discussion of global topological effects such as [[instanton]] configurations
of [[gauge fields]] is discussed yet further below.

We do however allow already here the [[field bundle]] to be a [[supermanifold]], so that we capture not just [[boson|bosonic]] fields
([[gauge fields|gauge]] [[force]] fields) but also [[fermion|fermionic]] fields ([[spinor]] [[matter]] fields).
This means that we assume background on [[synthetic differential supergeometry]] as developed in _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_
in the generality of [[super formal smooth sets]].
(It does _not_ mean that we restrict attention to, or even consider, field theories with _[[supersymmetry]]_ here;
it just means that we allow for [[fermionic fields]]).
This generality is necessary even apart from the description of fermionic fields: The generality of [[smooth sets]]
is neecessary for the description of smooth [[configuration spaces]] of fields (at least it
greatly simplifies the handling these spaces, compared to their description as [[infinite-dimensional manifolds]] )
and the generality of [[formal smooth sets]] is necessary for the [[transgression]] of variational differential forms
to field configurations, in particular for the discussion of the [[covariant phase space]].


Throughout we use the case of the real [[scalar field]] as an illustrative running example, which we develop alongside with the theory. The discussion of other [[field (physics)|field]] species that are of more genuine interest in applications is postponed to their dedicated sections below.

We use the [[Einstein summation convention]]: Expressions with repeated indicices indicate [[sum|summation]] over the
range of indices.


#### Geometry

In [[field theory]] one is concerned with [[differential geometry]] on
kinds of [[spaces]] that are more general than [[manifolds]] in several ways,
notably [[mapping spaces]] between [[supermanifolds]] and/or between [[formal manifolds]].
Even in the special cases when these [[mapping spaces]] may be given the structure of [[infinite-dimensional manifold|infinite-dimensional]]
manifolds (see at _[[manifold structure of mapping spaces]]_), careful inspection shows that this structure is often
much stronger than what is actually needed for the formulation of the theory. For example
in order to define a [[differential form]] on a [[mapping spaces]] (such as a [[symplectic form]]
on a [[configuration space]] of fields) one just needs the structure of a _[[diffeological space]]_
or (more generally) of a _[[smooth set]]_. If [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] and [[formal geometry|infinitesimal]]
aspects are taken into account, these are _[[super formal smooth sets]]_.

The formulation of ([[synthetic differential geometry|synthetic]]) [[differential geometry]] in this
fashion is introduced in the entries

* _[[geometry of physics -- smooth sets]]_

* _[[geometry of physics -- differential forms]]_

* _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_.

In the following we freely use the concepts introduced there.

We abbreviate

$$
  \mathbf{H} \coloneqq SuperFormSmoothSet
$$

for the [[category]] ([[topos]]) of [[super formal smooth sets]] that we work in.


#### Spacetime
  {#Spacetime}

Throughout, let

$$
  p \in \mathbb{N}
$$

be a [[natural number]] and write

$$
  \Sigma \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^{p,1} \coloneqq (\mathbb{R}^{p+1}, \eta)
$$

for [[Minkowski spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$, hence for the [[smooth manifold]] which is the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{p+1}$ of dimension $p+1$ equipped with the [[left invariant differential form|constant]] [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] $\eta$ which at the origin is given by the standard [[quadratic form]] of [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]]

$$
  (-, +, \cdots, +)
$$

in terms of the canonical [[coordinate functions]]

$$
  x^k \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{p+1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

which we index starting at zero: $(x^k)_{k = 0}^p$.

We write

$$
  dvol_\Sigma
   \;\coloneq\;
  d x^0 \wedge d x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p
  \in \Omega^{p+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p,1})
$$

for the induced [[volume form]], and we call

$$
  d x^0 \in \Omega^1(\Sigma)
$$

the canonical representative of the canonical [[time orientation]] on Minkowski spacetime.


#### Fields

A _[[field (physics)|field]] configuration_ on a given [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ is meant to be some kind of [[quantity]] assigned to each point of spacetime (each [[event]]), such that this assignment varies smoothly with spacetime points. For instance an _[[electromagnetic field]]_ configuration is at each point of spacetime a collection of [[vectors]] that encode the direction in which a [[charged particle]] passing through that point will feel a [[force]] (the [[Lorentz force]]).

This is readily formalized: If

$$
  F \in SmthMfd
$$

is the [[smooth manifold]] of "values" that the the given kind of field may take at any spacetime point, then a field configuration $\Phi$ is modeled as a [[smooth function]] from spacetime to this space of values:

$$
  \Phi
    \;\colon\;
   \Sigma
     \longrightarrow
   F
  \,.
$$

It will be useful to unify^^ spacetime and the space of field values into a single space, the [[Cartesian product]]

$$
  E \;\coloneqq\; Sigma \times F
$$

and to think of this equipped with the [[projection]] map onto the first factor as a [[fiber bundle]] of spaces of field values over spacetime


$$
  \array{
     E &\coloneqq& \Sigma \times F
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{fb}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{pr_1}}
     \\
     \Sigma
  }
  \,.
$$

This is then called the _[[field bundle]]_, which specifies the kind of values that the given field species may take at any point of spacetime. Since the space $F$ of field values is the [[fiber]] of this [[fiber bundle]], it is sometimes also called the _[[field fiber]]_.

###### Definition
**([[field (physics)|fields]] on a fixed [[spacetime]])**

Given a ([[Minkowski spacetime|Minkowski]]) [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$, then a _[[type]] of fields_ on $\Sigma$
is a [[smooth set|smooth]] [[fiber bundle]]

$$
  \array{E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}} \\ \Sigma }
  \,,
$$

called the _[[field bundle]]_,

Given a type of fields on $\Sigma$ this way, then a  _[[field (physics)|field]] configuration_ of that type on $\Sigma$
is a smooth  [[section]] of this [[bundle]], namely a [[smooth function]] of the form

$$
  \Phi \colon \Sigma \longrightarrow E
$$

such that composed with the [[projection]] map it is the [[identity function]], i.e. such that

$$
  fb \circ \Phi = id
  \phantom{AAAAAAA}
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\Phi}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma & = & \Sigma
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding _field [[configuration space]]_ is the [[smooth set|smooth]] [[space of sections|space of all these]], to be denoted

$$
  \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \in \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

This is the [[set]] of all field configurations $\Phi$ as above, and it is equipped with the
structure of a [[smooth set]] ([[diffeological space]]) by declaring that a _smooth family_ of field configurations,
parameterized over any [[Cartesian space]] $U$ is a smooth function

$$
  \array{
    U \times \Sigma &\overset{\Phi_{(-)}(-)}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    (u,x) &\mapsto& \Phi_u(x)
  }
$$

such that for each $u \in U$ we have $p \circ \Phi_{u}(-) = id_\Sigma$, i.e.

$$
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\Phi_{(-)}(-)}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    U \times \Sigma &\underset{pr_2}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma
  }
  \,.
$$


More generally, let $S \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ be a [[submanifold]] of spacetime. We write
$N_\Sigma(S) \hookrghtarrow \Sigma$ for its [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] in $\Sigma$.

If $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ is a [[field bundle]] (def. \ref{Fields})
then the _[[configuration space]] of fields restricted to $S$_, to be denoted

$$
  \Gamma_{S}(E) \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[space of sections]] restricted to $N_\Sigma(S)$.

There is a canonical [[evaluation]] [[smooth function]]

$$
  \label{FieldEvaluation}
  ev_S
   \;\colon\;
  N_\Sigma S \times \Gamma_{S}(E)
    \longrightarrow
  E
$$

which takes a [[pair]] consisting of an [[generalized element|element]] in $N_\Sigma S$
and a field configuration to the value of the field configuration at that point.

=--

For the time being, not to get distracted from the core idea of
field theory, we will focus on the following simple special case of field bundles:

+-- {: .num_example #TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}
###### Example
**([[trivial vector bundle]] as a [[field bundle]])**

In applications the [[field fiber]] $F$ is often a [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] and equipped with the structure of a [[vector space]]. In this case the trivial field bundle with fiber $F$ is of course a _[[trivial vector bundle|trivial]] [[vector bundle]]_.

Choosing any [[linear basis]] $(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s$ of the field fiber, then over [[Minkowski spacetime]] we have canonical [[coordinates]] on the total space of the field bundle

$$
  ( (x^\mu), ( \phi^a ) )
  \,,
$$

where the index $\mu$ ranges from $0$ to $p$, while the index $a$ ranges from 1 to $s$.

If this trivial vector bundle is regarded as a [[field bundle]] according to def. \ref{Fields}, then
a field configuration $\Phi$ is equivalently an $s$-[[tuple]] of [[real number|real]]-valued [[smooth functions]]
$\Phi^a \colon \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ on spacetime:

$$
  \Phi = ( \Phi^a )_{a = 1}^s
  \,.
$$

=--

The following simplest special case of this simple class of special cases
serves as a good toy example for the general theory:

+-- {: .num_example #RealScalarFieldBundle}
###### Example
**([[real scalar field]])**

If $\Sigma$ is a [[spacetime]] and if the [[field fiber]]

$$
  F \coloneqq \mathbb{R}
$$

is simply the [[real line]], then the corresponding trivial [[field bundle]] (def. \ref{Fields})

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{pr_1}}\downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$

is the _[[trivial fiber bundle|trivial]] [[real line bundle]]_ (a special case of example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) and the corresponding [[field (physics)|field]] type (def. \ref{Fields}) is called the _[[real scalar field]]_ on $\Sigma$. A configuration of this field is simply a [[smooth function]] on $\Sigma$ with values in the [[real numbers]]:

$$
  \Gamma_\Sigma(\Sigma \times \mathbb{R})
    \;\simeq\;
  C^\infty(\Sigma)
  \,.
$$

=--


#### Field variations

Given a [[field bundle]] as in def. \ref{Fields} above, then we know what type of quantities the corresponding fields assign to a given spacetime point ([[event]]). Among all consistent such field configurations, some are to qualify as those that "may occur in reality" if we think of the field theory as a means to describe parts of the [[observable universe]]. Moreover, if the reality to be described does not exhibit "action at a distance" then admissibility of its field configurations should be determined over arbitrary small spacetime regions, in fact over the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of any spacetime point. This means equivalently that the realized field configurations should be those that satisfy a given _[[differential equation]]_, hence an [[equation]] between the value of the [[derivatives]] of the field
configuration at any spacetime point.

In order to formalize this, it is useful to first collect all the possible derivatives that a field may have at any given point into one big space of "field derivatives at spacetime points". This collection is called the _[[jet bundle]]_ of the [[field bundle]], given as def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below.

Moving around in this space means to change the possible value of fields and their derivatives, hence to _vary_ the fields. Accordingly _[[variational calculus]]_ of fields is just [[differential calculus]] on the [[jet bundle]] of the [[field bundle]], this we consider in def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below.

###### Definition
**([[jet bundle]] of a [[trivial vector bundle]] over [[Minkowski spacetime]])**

Given a [[field fiber]] [[vector space]] $F = \mathbb{R}^s$ with [[linear basis]] $(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s$,
then for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ a natural number,  the _order-$k$ [[jet bundle]]_

$$
  \array{
    J^k_{\Sigma}( E )
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{jb_k}}
    \\
    \Sigma
  }
$$

over [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\Sigma$ of the [[trivial vector bundle]]

$$
  E \coloneqq \Sigma \times F
$$

is the [[Cartesian space]] which is spanned by coordinate functions to be denoted as follows:

$$
  \left(
     (x^\mu)
     \,,\,
     (\phi^a )
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu_1\mu_2} )
     \,,\,
     \cdots
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} )
  \right)
$$

where the indices $\mu, \mu_1, \mu_2, \codts$ range from 0 to $p$, while the index $a$ ranges from $1$ to $s$. In terms of these coordinates the [[bundle]] [[projection]] map $jb_k$ is just the one that remembers the spacetime coordinates $x^\mu$ and forgets the values of the field $\phi^a$ and its derivatives $\phi_{\mu}$. Similarly there are intermediate projection maps

$$
  \array{
    \cdots
     &\overset{jb_{3,2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    J^{2}_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{jb_{2,1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    J^1_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{jb_1}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    && &{}_{\mathllap{jb_2}}\searrow& {}^{\mathllap{jb_1}}\downarrow  &\swarrow_{\mathrlap{fb}}&
    \\
    && && \Sigma &&
  }
$$

given by forgetting coordinates with more indices.

The _infinite-order [[jet bundle]]_

$$
  J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[direct limit]] over these finite order jet bundles,
formed in the [[category]] of [[smooth sets]]. This means that it is the [[smooth set]] which is defined
by the fact that a smooth function

$$
  U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} J^\infty_\Sigma(E)
$$

from some [[Cartesian space]] $U$ is equivalently a system of ordinary smooth functions
into all the finite-order jet spaces

$$
  \left(
    U \overset{f_k}{\longrightarrow} J^k_\Sigma(E)
  \right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}
  \,,
$$

such that this system is compatible with the
above projection maps, i.e. such that

$$
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\forall} \left(
    jb_{k+1,k} \circ f_{k+1} = f_k
  \right)
  \phantom{AAAAAAA}
  \array{
    && && U &&
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{f_2}}\swarrow&  {}_{\mathllap{f_1}}\downarrow  &\searrow^{f_0}&
    \\
    \cdots
     &\overset{jb_{3,2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    J^{2}_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{jb_{2,1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    J^1_\Sigma(E)s
      &\overset{jb_1}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    && &{}_{\mathllap{jb_2}}\searrow& {}^{\mathllap{jb_1}}\downarrow  &\swarrow_{\mathrlap{fb}}&
    \\
    && && \Sigma &&
  }
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #JetProlongation}
###### Definition
**([[jet prolongation]])

The [[smooth function]] from the [[space of sections]] of the original bundle to the space of sections of the jet bundle which records the field $\Phi$ and all its spacetimes [[derivatives]] is called _[[jet prolongation]]_:

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{j^\infty_\Sigma}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma_\Sigma(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
    \\
    (\Phi^a)
    &\mapsto&
    \left(
    \left( \Phi^a \right)
      \,,\,
      \left(  \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu}  \right)
      \,,\,
      \left( \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^a}{\partial x^{\mu_1} \partial x^{\mu_2}}  \right)
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

So the canonical [[coordinates]] on the jet bundle are the spacetime-point-wise _possible_ values of fields and field derivates,
while the [[jet prolongation]] picks the actual collections of field derivatives that may occur for an actual field
configuration.

While the [[jet bundle]] is not [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]],
reflecting the fact that there are arbitrary higher orders of spacetime derivatives of a field configurations,
it turns out that it is only very "mildly [[infinite dimensional manifold|infinite dimensional]]"
in that
smooth  functions on jet bundles turn out to _locally_ depend on only finitely many of the jet coordinates
(i.e. only on a finite order of spacetime derivatives). This is the content
of the following prop. \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold} \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold}.
In practice this means that the situation is very convenient:

1. Any given [[local Lagrangian density]] (which will define a field theory, we come to this in def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below)
   will locally depend on some finite number $k$ of derivatives and may hence locally
   be treated as living on the ordinary manifold $J^k_\Sigma(E)$.

1. while at the same time all formulas (such as for the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]], def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) work uniformly
without worries about fixing a maximal order of derivatives.

+-- {: .num_prop #JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold}
###### Proposition
**([[jet bundle]] is a [[locally pro-manifold]])**

Given a [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ as in def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime},
then a [[smooth function]] out of it

$$
  J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \longrightarrow X
$$

is such that around each point of $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ there is a [[neighbourhood]] $U \subset J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$
on which it is given by a function on a smooth function on $J^k_\Sigma(E)$ for some finite $k$.

###### Definition
**([[variational bicomplex]])**

On the [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$ of a [[trivial vector bundle]] over [[Minkowski spacetime]] as in def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} we may consider its [[de Rham complex]] of
[[differential forms]]; we write its [[de Rham differential]] in boldface:

$$
  \mathbf{d} \;\colon\; \Omega^\bullet(J^\infty_\Sigma(E)) \longrightarrow \Omega^{\bullet+1}(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
  \,.
$$

Since the jet bundle unified spacetime with field values, we want to decompose this differential into
a contribution coming from forming the [[total derivatives]] of fields along spacetime ("[[horizontal derivatives]]"), and
actual _variation_ of fields at a fixed spacetime point ("[[vertical derivatives]]"):


The  _[[total derivative|total spacetime derivative]]_ or  _[[horizontal derivative]]_ on $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$
is the map on [[differential forms]] on the jet bundle of the form

$$
  d
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{\bullet+1}( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
$$

which on functions $f \colon J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \to \mathbb{R}$ (i.e. on 0-forms) is defined by

$$
  \label{SpacetimeTotalDerivativeOnSmoothFunctions}
  \begin{aligned}
    d f
    & \coloneqq
    \frac{d f}{d x^\mu}
    \mathbf{d} x^\mu
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    \underoverset{\mu = 0}{p}{\sum}
    \left(
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^a}
      \phi^a_{,\mu}
      +
      \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial \phi^a_{,\nu}}
      \phi^a_{,\nu \mu }
      +
      \cdots
    \right)
    \mathbf{d} x^\mu
  \end{aligned}
$$

and extended to all forms by the graded [[Leibniz rule]], hence  as a nilpotent [[derivation]] of degree +1.

The  _[[vertical derivative]]_

$$
  \delta
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{\bullet+1}( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )
$$

is what remains of the full [[de Rham differential]] when the total spacetime derivative ([[horizontal derivative]]) is subtracted:

$$
  \delta \coloneqq \mathbf{d} - d
  \,.
$$

This defines a bigrading on the [[de Rham complex]] of $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$, into horizontal degree $r$ and vertical degree $s$

$$
  \Omega^\bullet\left( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \right)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{r,s}{\oplus} \Omega^{r,s}(E)
$$

such that the horizontal and vertical derivative increase horizontal or vertical degree, respectively:

$$
  \array{
     C^\infty(J^\infty_\Sigma(E)) = & \Omega^{0,0}(E)
       &\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}&
     \Omega^{1,0}(E)

in its [[variational bicomplex]] (def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
we have the following:

* The spacetime [[total derivative]] ([[horizontal derivative]]) of a spacetime coordinate function $x^\mu$
  coincides with its ordinary de Rham differential

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      d x^\mu
      & =
      \frac{\partial x^\mu}{ \partial x^\nu} \mathbf{d}x^\nu
      \\
      & = \mathbf{d} x^\mu
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  which hence is a horizontal 1-form

  $$
    \mathbf{d}x^\mu \;\in\; \Omega^{1,0}_\Sigma(E)
    \,.
  $$

* Therefore the variational derivative ([[vertical derivative|vertical derivative]]) of a spacetime coordinate function vanishes:

  $$
    \delta x^\mu = 0
    \,,
  $$

  reflective the fact that $x^\mu$ is not a field coordinate that could be varied.

* In particular the given [[volume form]] on $\Sigma$ gives a horizontal $p+1$-form on the jet bundle,
  which has the same coordinate expression (and which we denote by the same symbol)

  $$
    dvol_\Sigma =  d x^0 \wedge d x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p
     \;\in\;
    \Omega^{p+1,0}
    \,.
  $$

* Generally any horizontal $k$-form is of the form

  $$
    f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} d x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{\mu_k}
    \;\in\;
    \Omega^{k,0}_{\Sigma}(E)
  $$

  for

  $$
    f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} = f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}\left((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots\right)
    \in C^\infty(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
  $$

  any smooth function of the spacetime coordinates and the field coordinates (locally depending only on a finite
  order of these, by prop. \ref{JetBundleIsLocallyProManifold}).

* In particular every horizontal $(p+1)$-form $\mathbf{L} \in \Omega^{p+1,0}(E)$ is proportional to the
  above volume form

  $$
    \mathbf{L} = L \, dvol_\Sigma
  $$

  for $L = L((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots)$ some smooth function that may depend on all the
  spacetime and field coordinates.

* The spacetimes [[total derivatives]] /horizontal derivatives) of the variational derivative (vertical derivative) $\delta \phi$ of a field variable is the differential 2-form of horizontal degree 1 and vertical degree 2 given by

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      d (\delta \phi^a)
      & =
      -
      \delta (d \phi_a)
      \\
      & =
      - (\delta \phi^a_{,\mu}) \wedge \mathbf{d} x^\mu
    \end{aligned}
    \,.
  $$

  In words this says that "the spacetime derivative of the variation of the field is the variation of its spacetime derivative".

###### Proposition
**([[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] along [[jet prolongation]] compatible with (total) spacetime derivatives)**

Let $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ be a [[field bundle]] over a [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ (def. \ref{Fields}),
with induced [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty_\Sigma(E)$

Then for $\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ any field configuration, the [[pullback of differential forms]]

$$
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
   \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega^\bullet(\Sigma)
$$

along the [[jet prolongation]] of $\Phi$ (def. \ref{JetProlongation}):

1. intertwines the [[de Rham differential]] on [[spacetime]] with the [[total derivative|total]] spacetime derivative ([[horizontal derivative]]) on the [[jet bundle]]:

   $$
     d \circ j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
     \;=\;
     j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ d
     \,.
   $$

1. annihilates all [[vertical differential forms]]

   $$
     j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast\vert_{\Omega^{r, \geq 1}_\Sigma(E)} = 0
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that generally the operation of [[pullback of differential forms]]
along any smooth function intertwines the full [[de Rham differentials]]. In particular
we have on general grounds that

$$
  d \circ j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
  =
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ \mathbf{d}
  \,.
$$

This means that the second statement immediately follows from the
first, by definition of the variational (vertical) derivative as the differece between
the full de Rham differential and the horizontal one:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ \delta
    & =
    j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \circ (\mathbf{d} - d)
    \\
    & =
    (d - d) \circ j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
    \\
    & =
    0
  \end{aligned}
$$

It remains to see the first statement:

Since the [[jet prolongation]] $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)$ preserves the spacetime coordinates $x^\mu$
(being a [[section]] of the [[jet bundle]]) it is immediate that the claimed relation
is satisfied on the
horizontal [[linear basis|basis]] 1-forms $\mathbf{d}x^\mu = d x^\mu$ (example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle}):

$$
  d j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast( \mathbf{d}x^\mu )
  =
  d^2 x^\mu = 0
  \phantom{AAAAA}
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast d \mathbf{d} x^\mu
  =
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast d^2 x^\mu
  \,.
$$

Therefore it finally remains only to check the first statement on smooth functions (0-forms).
So let

$$
  f
    =
  f\left(
    (x^\mu)
    \,,\,
    (\phi^a)
    \,,\,
    ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
    \,,\,
    \cdots
  \right)
$$

be a smooth function on the jet bundle. Then by the [[chain rule]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast
    f\left(
      (x^\mu)
      \,,\,
      (\phi^a)
      \,,\,
      ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
    & =
    d
    f\left(
      (x^\mu)
      \,,\,
      (\Phi^a)
      \,,\,
      \left(  \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu} \right)
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \left(
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^a}
      \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^a_{,\nu}}
      \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^a}{\partial x^\nu \partial x^\mu}
      +
      \cdots
    \right)
    d x^\mu
  \end{aligned}
$$

That this is equal to $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast d f$ follows by the very definition
of the total spacetime derivative of $f$ (eq:SpacetimeTotalDerivativeOnSmoothFunctions).

While the [[variational bicomplex]] on the jet bundle encodes the [[variational calculus]]
on all _possible_ derivatives of field configurations, it may be [[transgression|transgressed]]
to the [[configuration space]] of actual fields (def. \ref{Fields}) to yield information
on the variation of actual fields. This involves [[integration]] over regions of [[spacetimes]],
and hence requires a condition on the differential forms over the jet bundle to have [[compact support]]
along spacetime:

The _spacetime support  _ $supp_\Sigma(A)$ of a [[differential form]] $A \in \Omega^\bullet(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))$
on the [[jet bundle]] of $E$ is the [[topological closure]] of the maximal subset $S \subset \Sigma$
such that the restriction of $A$ to the jet bundle restrited to this subset vanishes:

$$
  supp_\Sigma(A) \coloneqq Cl( \{ x \in \Sigma |  \iota_{\{x\}^\ast A = 0} \} )
$$

We write

$$
  \Omega^{r,s}_{\Sigma,cp}(E)

  \left\{
    A \in \Omega^{r,s}_\Sigma(E)
    \;\vert\;

#### Equations of motion


Given any type of fields (def. \ref{Fields}), those field configurations that
are to be regarded as "physically realizable" (if we think of the field theory as a description of the [[observable universe]])
should satisfy some [[differential equation]] (the "[[equation of motion]]"), meaning that realizability of any field configuration may
be checked upon restricting the configuration to the [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] of each spacetime point.
This expresses the physical absence of "action at a distance" and is one aspect of what it means to have
a _[[local field theory]]_.

For many field theories of interest, their [[differential equation|differential]] [[equation of motion]]
is not a random [[PDE]], but is of the special kind that exhibits the "[[principle of extremal action]]"
determined by a [[local Lagrangian density]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below). Therefore these are called _[[Lagrangian field theories]]_, and this is what we consider here.

In terms of [[variational calculus]] on [[jet bundles]], the [[principle of extremal action]]
has a simple precise manifestation, expressed by the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]]
of the Lagrangian density (def. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below)
and the _[[Euler-Lagrange equation]] [[equation of motion|of motion]]_ that it encodes
(def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime} below).

On the one hand it is simply an [[experiment|experimental fact]] that the [[observable universe]]
follows the [[principle of extremal action]] -- aspects of which have been known in ancient times already --
hence that it is well described by [[local Lagrangian field theory]]. But there is also
a mathematical reason that singles out the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]]:
It turns out to be what makes the [[Poincare lemma]] on [[spacetime]] compatible with that on the [[jet bundle]]
by completing the [[sheaf of chain complexes]] of the [[horizontal differential forms]] on the [[jet bundle]] to a [[resolution]]
of the the [[ground field]], viewed as a [[constant sheaf]] on the jet bundle:
this the _[[Euler-Lagrange complex]]_ (spring).

###### Definition
**([[local Lagrangian density]])**

Given a [[field bundle]] $E$ over a $(p+1)$-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\Sigma$ as in example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}, then a _[[local Lagrangian density]]_ $\mathbf{L}$ (for the type of field thus defined) is a [[horizontal differential form]] of degree $(p+1)$ (def. \ref{VariationalBicomplexOnSecondOrderJetBundleOverTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) on the corresponding [[jet bundle]]
(def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}):

$$
  \mathbf{L} \;\in \; \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma}(E)
  \,.
$$

By example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle}
in terms of the given [[volume form]] on spacetimes, any such Lagrangian density may uniquely be written as

$$
  \mathbf{L} = L \, dvol_\Sigma
$$

where the [[coefficient]] function (the _Lagrangian function_)
is a smooth function on the spacetime and field coordinates:

$$
  L = L((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots )
  \,.

###### Proposition
**([[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]] and [[presymplectic current]])**

If a [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}$ as in def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}, then its de Rham differential has a _unique_ decomposition as a sum of two terms

$$
  \mathbf{d} \mathbf{L}
  =
  \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}
  -
  d \Theta
$$

such that $\delta EL$ is a "[[source form]]":

$$
  \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}
    \;\in\;
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma}(E) \wedge \delta \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma}(E)
    \;\subset\;
  \Omega^{p+1,1}_{\Sigma}(E)
  \,.
$$

The map

$$
   \delta_{EL} \;\colon\; \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma}(E) \longrightarrow \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma}(E) \wedge \delta \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma}(E)
$$

thus defined is called the _[[Euler-Lagrange operator]]_ and is explicitly given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta_{EL} L \, dvol_\Sigma
    & \coloneqq
    \frac{\delta L}{ \delta \phi^a}
    \delta \phi^a \wedge dvol_\Sigma
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    \left(
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a}
      -
      \frac{d}{d x^\mu}
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
      +
      \frac{d^2}{d x^{\mu^1} d x^{\mu^2}}
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{\mu_1, \mu_2}}
      -
      \cdots
    \right)
    \delta \phi^a
    \wedge
    dvol_\Sigma
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

The remaining term $d \Theta$ is unique, while $\Theta \in \Omega^{p,1}_{\Sigma}(E)$ is unique only up to terms $d \alpha$ in the image of $d$.
One possible choice is

$$
  \label{StandardThetaForTrivialVectorFieldBundleOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
  \begin{aligned}
    \Theta
    & \coloneqq \phantom{+}
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}

        \frac{d}{d x^\nu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu \nu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
      \right)

$$
  \iota_{\partial_{\mu}} dvol_\Sigma
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (-1)^{\mu} d x^0 \wedge \cdots d x^{\mu-1} \wedge d x^{\mu+1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p
$$

denotes the contraction of the volume form with the [[vector field]] $\partial_\mu$.

The [[vertical derivative]] of a chosen $\Theta$ is called a _[[pre-symplectic current]]_ for $\mathbf{L}$:

$$
  \Omega \coloneqq \delta \Theta \;\;\; \in \Omega^{p,2}_{\Sigma}(E)
  \,,
$$

which, by the above, is unique up to addition of a total spacetime derivative $d \delta \alpha$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using $\mathbf{L} = L dvol_\Sigma$ and that $d \mathbf{L} = 0$ by degree reasons (example \ref{BasicFactsAboutVarationalCalculusOnJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundle}), we find

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{d}\mathbf{L}
    & =
    \left(
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a} \delta \phi^a
      +
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}} \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
      +
      \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \mu_2}} \delta \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \mu_2}
      +
      \cdots
    \right)
    \wedge dvol_{\Sigma}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The idea now is to have $d \Theta$ pick up those terms that would appear as [[boundary]] terms under the [[integral]]
$\int_\Sigma j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \mathbf{d}L$ if we were to consider [[integration by parts]] to remove
spacetime derivatives of $\delta \phi^a$.

the total horizontal derivative of $\Theta$ from (eq:StandardThetaForTrivialVectorFieldBundleOnMinkowskiSpacetime) as follows:

        -

        \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
      \right)
      + \cdots
    \right)
    \wedge dvol_\Sigma
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in the last line we used that

$$
  d x^{\mu_1} \wedge \iota_{\partial_{\mu_2}} dvol_\Sigma
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      dvol_\Sigma &\vert& \text{if}\, \mu_1 = \mu_2
      \\
      0 &\vert& \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
$$

Here the two terms proportional to $\frac{d}{d x^\nu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu \nu}} \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}$
cancel out, and we are left with

$$
  d \Theta
  \;=\;
    -
      \left(
        \frac{d}{d x^\mu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
        -
        \frac{d^2}{ d x^\mu d x^\nu}
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu \nu}}
        +
        \cdots
      \right)
      \delta \phi^a \wedge dvol_\Sigma
        -
      \left(
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\mu}
        +
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\nu \mu}}
        \delta \phi^a_{,\nu \mu}
        +
        \cdots
      \right)
      \wedge dvol_\Sigma
$$


Hence $-d \Theta$ shares with $\mathbf{d} \mathbf{L}$ the terms that are proportional to
$\delta \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}$ for $k \geq 1$,
and so the remaining terms are proportional to $\delta \phi^a$, as claimed:

$$
  \mathbf{d}L + d \Theta
  =
  \underset{
    = \delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}
  }{
  \underbrace{
  \left(
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a}
    -
    \frac{d}{d x^\mu}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
    +
    \frac{d^2}{d x^\mu d x^\nu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu\nu}}
    +
    \cdots
  \right)
  \delta \phi^a \wedge dvol_\Sigma
  }}
  \,.

###### Definition
**([[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equation of motion]])**

Given a [[field bundle]] $E$ over [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ as in example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}
equipped with a [[local Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L} \in  \Omega^{p+1,1}_{\Sigma}(E)$ as in def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}
then the corresponding _[[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equation of motion]]_
on fields $\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ is the equation

$$
  j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \left(\delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}\right) = 0
  \,,
$$

where $j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi) \colon \Sigma \to J^\infty_{\Sigma}(E)$ denotes the [[jet prolongation]] of $\Phi$ (def. \ref{JetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}), $j^\infty_{\Sigma}(\Phi)^\ast$ the operation of
[[pullback
of differential forms]] along this function, and $\delta_{EL}$ is the
[[Euler-Lagrange operator]] from prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}.

By that same proposition this equation is
equivalently the [[differential equation]]

$$
  \left(
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a}
      -
    \frac{d}{d x^\mu}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu}}
    +
    \frac{d^2}{d x^\mu d x^\nu} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi^a_{,\mu\nu}}
    -
    \cdots
  \right)
  \left(
     (x^\mu), (\Phi^a), \left( \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu}, \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu \partial x^\nu} \right)
  \right)
  \;=\;
  0
  \,.
$$

We write

$$
  \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{\delta_{EL} L = 0}
    \hookrightarrow
  \Gamma_\Sigma(E)
$$

for the [[smooth space|smooth]] subspace of the space of all field configurations on those that solve this
differential equation.

In the physics literature this subspace of solutions to the [[equations of motion]] is also called the _[[shell]]_.
Phrases like "working on-shell" refer to restricting constructions to this the subspace of solutions
inside the full [[configuration space]].

###### Definition
**([[covariant phase space]])

Let

1. $\Sigma$ be a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$;

1. $E \overset{fb}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma$ a [[field bundle]] (def. \ref{Fields})

1. $\mathbf{L} \in \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E)$ a [[local Lagrangian density]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime});

and consider

* $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ a [[Cauchy surface]].


We say that 

1. the _[[phase space]]_ with respect to $\Sigma_p$ is the space of solutions to the [[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]] (def. \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
restricted to the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] $N_\Sigma(\Sigma_p)$ (def. \ref{ConfigurationSpaceOverSubmanifoldOfSpacetime}):

   $$
    \Gamma_{\Sigma_p}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0}
   $$


1. the space $\mathcal{F}_{loc}$ of _[[local observables]] on phase space_
is the [[image]] under [[transgression]] to $\Sigma_p$ (def. \ref{TransgressionOfVariationalDifferentialFormsToConfigrationSpaces})
of the [[Hamiltonian form|Hamiltonian]] [[horizontal differential form|horizontal]] $p$-forms with compact spacetime support (def. \ref{SpacetimeSupport}):

   $$
     \mathcal{F}_{loc}
       \;\coloneqq\;
     im\left(
       \Omega^{r,0}_{\Sigma,cp,Ham}(E)
         \overset{\tau_{\Sigma_p}}{\longrightarrow}
       C^\infty\left( 
         \Gamma_{\Sigma_p}(E)_{\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} = 0}         
       \right)
     \right)
   $$

1. the _[[Poisson bracket]]_ on $\mathcal{F}_{loc}$ is that induced from the [[Poisson Lie n-algebra]] bracket on 
Hamiltonian forms:

   $$
     \array{
       \Omega^{r,0}_{\Sigma,cp,Ham}(E)
       \otimes
       \Omega^{r,0}_{\Sigma,cp,Ham}(E)
         &\longrightarrow&
       \Omega^{r,0}_{\Sigma,cp,Ham}(E)
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{\tau_{\Sigma_p} \otimes \tau_{\Sigma_p}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tau_{\Sigma_p}}}
       \\
       \mathcal{F}_{loc} \otimes \mathcal{F}_{loc}
         &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}&
       \mathcal{F}_{loc}
