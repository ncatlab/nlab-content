###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. For $f \colon X \to Y$ any morphism of [[pointed objects]], and for $A$ a [[pointed object]], def. \ref{CategoryOfPointedObjects}, then the sequence

$$
  [A,hofib(f)]_\ast \longrightarrow [A,X]_\ast \longrightarrow [A,Y]_{\ast}
$$

is [[exact sequence|exact]] (the sequecne being the image of the [[homotopy fiber]] sequence of def. \ref{HomotopyFiber} under the hom-functor of the pointed [[homotopy category of a model category]]

$$
  [A,-]_\ast \;\colon\; Ho(\mathcal{C}^{/\ast}) \longrightarrow Set^{\ast/}
  \,.
$$

###### Proof

We may choose representatives such that $A$ is cofibrant, and $f$ is a fibration. Then we are faced with an ordinary pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    hofib(f) &\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
$$ 

and the hom-classes are represented by genuine morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. From this it follows immediately that $ker(p_\ast)$ includes $im(i_\ast)$. Hence it remains to show that every element in $ker(p_\ast)$ indeed comes from $im(i_\ast)$.

But an element in $ker(p_\ast)$ is represented by a morphism $\alpha \colon A \to X$ such that there is a left homotopy as in the following diagram

$$
  \array{
     && A &\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     && {}^{\mathllap{i_0}}\downarrow &{}^{\tilde \eta}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     A &\overset{i_1}{\longrightarrow} & Cyl(A) &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
     \\
     \ast && \longrightarrow && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now by lemma \ref{ComponentMapsOfCylinderAndPathSpaceInGoodSituation} the square here has a lift $\tilde \eta$, as shown. This means that $i_1 \circ\tilde \eta$ is left homotopic to $\alpha$. But by the universal property of the fiber, $i_1 \circ \tilde \eta$ factors through $i \colon hofib(f) \to X$.
