Throughout, let $k$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]] (for instance the [[complex numbers]]).


The proof proceeds in three main steps:

1. Proposition \ref{LengthOfObjectIsBounded} states that in a $k$-[[tensor category]] an object $X$ being of subexponential growth is equivalent to the existence of a [[Schur functor]] that annihilates this, hence equivalent to the statement that some power of $X$, skew-symmetrized in sme variables and symmetrized in others, vaishes. 

   Hence this proposition is where the [[symmetric group]] action on tensor powers appears, from just a kind of finite-dimensionality assumption.

1. Proposition \ref{SchurFinitenessImpliesExistenceOfSuperFiberFunctor} in turn says that if every object in $\mathcal{A}$ is annihilated by some [[Schur functor]], then there exists a super [[fiber functor]] on $\mathcal{A}$ over some [[supercommutative superalgebra]] $R$, hence then every object of $\mathcal{A}$ has underlying it a [[super vector space]] with some extra structure.

###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{A}$ a $k$-[[tensor category]], then the following are equivalent:

1. the category $\mathcal{A}$ has subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth});

1. for every object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a [[partition]] $\lambda$ of $n$ such that the corresponding value of the [[Schur functor]], def. \ref{SchurFunctor}, on $X$ vanishes: $S_\lambda(X) = 0$.
