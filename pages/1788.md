###### Lemma

In a [[category of fibrant objects]] $\mathcal{C}_f$, def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects}, let 

$$
 \array{
  A_1 &&\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}&& A_2
  \\
  & {}_{\in Fib}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in Fib}
  \\
  && B
 }
$$

be a morphism over  some object $B$ in $\mathcal{C}_f$
and let $u \colon B' \to B$ be any morphism in 
$\mathcal{C}_f$. Let 

$$
 \array{
  u^*A_1 &&\stackrel{u^* f}{\longrightarrow}&& u^* A_2
  \\
  & {}_{\in Fib}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in Fib}
  \\
  && B'
 }
$$

be the corresponding morphism pulled back along $u$.

Then

* if $f$ is a fibration then also $u^* f$ is a fibration;

* if $f$ is a weak equivalence then also $u^* f$ is a weak equivalence.

###### Proof

For $f \in Fib$ the statement follows from the [[pasting law]] which says that if in 

$$
  \array{
    B' \times_B A_1 &\longrightarrow& A_1
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{u^* f \in Fib}} 
    && \;\;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{f \in Fib}}
    \\
    B' \times_B A_2 &\longrightarrow& A_2
    \\
    \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}} && \;\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    B' &\stackrel{u}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
$$

the bottom and the total square are pullback squares, then so is the top square. The same reasoning applies for $f \in W \cap Fib$.

Now to see the case that $f\in W$:

Consider the [[full subcategory]] $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$ of the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ (def. \ref{SliceCategory}) on its fibrant objects, i.e. the full subcategory of the slice category on the fibrations 

$$
  \array{
    X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    B
  }
$$

into $B$. By factorizing for every such fibration the [[diagonal morphisms]] into the [[fiber product]] $X \underset{B}{\times} X$ through a weak equivalence followed by a fibration, we obtain path space objects $Path_B(X)$ relative to $B$: 

$$
  \array{
   (\Delta_X)/B
   \;\colon
    &
    X 
      &\overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}&
    Path_B(X)
      &\overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}&
    X \underset{B}{\times} X
    \\
    & & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    & && B
  }
  \,.
$$

With these, the [[factorization lemma]] (lemma \ref{FactorizationLemma}) applies in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$. 

(Notice that for this we do need the restriction of $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ to the fibrations, because this ensures that the projections $p_i \colon X_1 \times_B X_2 \to X_i$ are still fibrations, which is used in the proof of the factorization lemma ([here](#ProofOfFactorizationLemma)).)

So now given any 

$$
  \array{
    X && \underoverset{\in W}{f}{\longrightarrow} && Y
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    && B
  }  
$$

apply the [[factorization lemma]] in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$ to factor it as 

$$
  \array{
    X 
      &\overset{i \in W}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Path_B(f) 
      &\overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow 
     &\downarrow& 
    \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    && B
  }  
  \,.
$$

By the previous discussion it is sufficient now to show that the base change of $i$ to $B'$ is still a weak equivalence. But by the factorization lemma in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})_f$, the morphism $i$ is right inverse to another acyclic fibration over $B$:

$$
  \array{
    id_X
    \;\colon
    &
    X 
      &\overset{i \in W}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Path_B(f) 
      &\overset{\in W \cap Fib}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    & & 
    {}_{\mathllap{\in Fib}}\searrow 
     &\downarrow& 
    \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    & && B
  }  
  \,.
$$

(Notice that if we had applied the factorization lemma of $\Delta_X$ in $\mathcal{C}_f$ instead of $(\Delta_X)/B$ in $(\mathcal{C}_{/B})$ then the corresponding triangle on the right here would not commute.) 

Now we may reason as before: the base change of the top morphism here is exhibited by the following pasting composite of pullbacks:

$$
  \array{
    B' \underset{B}{\times} X
     &\longrightarrow&
    X
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    B' \underset{B}{\times} Path_B(f) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    Path_B(f)
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    B' \underset{B}{\times}X  
      &\longrightarrow& 
    X
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(pb)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    B'
     &\longrightarrow&
    B
  }
  \,.
$$

The acyclic fibration $Path_B(f)$ is preserved by this pullback, as is the identity $id_X \colon X \to Path_B(X)\to X$. Hence the weak equivalence $X \to Path_B(X)$ is preserved by [[two-out-of-three]] (def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}).
