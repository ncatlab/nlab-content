######Definition
We shall say that a map $u:A\to B$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$ 
has the *left lifting property* with respect to a map $f:X\to Y$, 
or that $f$ has the *right lifting property* with respect to $u$,
if every commutative square
\begin{xymatrix}
A  \ar[d]_u \ar[r]^{x}  & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
B \ar[r]_{y}         & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a _diagonal filler_ $d:B\to X$,
\begin{xymatrix}
A  \ar[d]_u \ar[r]^{x} & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
B \ar[r]_{y} \ar[ur]^d        & Y
\end{xymatrix}
We shall denote this relation by $u\,\pitchfork\, f$.
Notice that the condition $u\,\pitchfork\, f$ means that
the following commutative square $Sq(u,f)$,
\[
\label{20}
\]
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(B,X)  \ar[d]_{hom(B,f)}  \ar[rr]^{hom(u,X)}  & & hom(A,X)  \ar[d]^{hom(A,f)}  \\
hom(B,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(u,Y)}      & & hom(A,Y),
\end{xymatrix}
is [epicartesian](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares),
or equivalently if the map
$$Hom(u,f)': hom(B,X)\to hom(B,Y) \times_{hom(A,Y)}hom(A,X)$$
is surjective.

######Notation
If $\mathcal{M}$
is a class of maps,
we shall denote by ${}^\pitchfork\!\mathcal{M}$ (resp. 
$\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$)
the class of maps having the left (resp. the right) lifting property
with respect to every map in $\mathcal{M}$.
We shall say that ${}^\pitchfork\!\!\mathcal{M}$ is the *left complement* of
$\mathcal{M}$, and that $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is its *right complement*.

######Example
Recall  that a map of simplicial sets is said to be a [[Kan fibration]]
if it has the right lifting property with respect to 
the inclusion $h^k_n: \Lambda^k[n] \subset  \Delta[n]$
for every $n\gt 0$ and $0\le k\le n$. 
A simplicial set $X$ is a [[Kan complex]] iff
the map $X\to 1$ is a Kan fibration.

Then a functor in the category $\mathbf{Cat}$

with respect to the inclusion $\{0\}\subset J$.

######Definition
We shall say that a pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ of classes of maps
in a category $\mathbf{E}$ is a **weak factorisation system**
if the following conditions are satisfied:

* every map $f:A\to B$ admits a factorisation $f=p u:A\to E\to B$ 
with $u\in \mathcal{L}$ and $p\in \mathcal{R}$;


* $\mathcal{L}= {}^\pitchfork\mathcal{R}$ and 
$\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork $;

=--

We shall say that a factorisation $f=p u:A\to E\to B$ with $u\in \mathcal{L}$ and $p\in \mathcal{R}$ is a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-*factorisation* of the map $f$. The class $\mathcal{L}$ is called the *left class* of the system, and the class $\mathcal{R}$ is called the *right class* . 




+-- {: .un_defn #FSimpliesWFS}

The category of sets $\mathbf{Set}$

$Inj$ the class of injections 
and $Surj$ is the class of surjections.

######Duality
If $( \mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation system
in a category $\mathbf{E}$, then the pair
$(\mathcal{R}^o,\mathcal{L}^o)$ is a weak factorisation system
in the opposite category $\mathbf{E}^o$.
=--


If $\mathcal{M}$ is a class of maps in a category $\mathbf{E}$,
then for any object $B\in \mathbf{E}$ we shall denote
by $\mathcal{M}/B$ the class of maps in the slice
category $\mathbf{E}/B$
whose underlying map in $\mathbf{E}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.
Dually, we shall denote by $B\backslash \mathcal{M}$ the class of maps in the coslice category $B\backslash \mathbf{E}$ whose underlying map belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.


+--{: .un_prop #slicewfs}
###### Slice and coslice
If $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation
system in a category $\mathbf{E}$, then the pair
$(\mathcal{L}/B,\mathcal{R}/B)$ is a weak factorisation system
in the slice category $\mathbf{E}/B$ for any object
$B$ in $\mathbf{E}$. Dually, the pair
$(B\backslash \mathcal{L},B\backslash \mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation system in the coslice category $B\backslash \mathbf{E}$.

######Proof
Left to the reader.

##Closure properties##



If $\mathcal{C} $ and $\mathcal{F} $
are two classes of maps in $\mathbf{E}$, we shall 
write $\mathcal{C}\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{F} $
to indicate that we have $u\pitchfork f$ for every $u\in \mathcal{C} $
and $f\in \mathcal{F} $. 
The three conditions
$$ \mathcal{C}\subseteq {}^\pitchfork \mathcal{F}, \quad \quad  \mathcal{C} \,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{F},\quad \quad
\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{C}^\pitchfork  $$
are equivalent.
If $\mathcal{C}=\{u\}$,
we shall write $u \,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{F} $ instead of 
$\{u\}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{F} $. Similarly, we shall write
$\mathcal{C} \,\pitchfork\, f$ instead of $\mathcal{C} \pitchfork \{f\}$.


The operations $\mathcal{M}\mapsto \mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$
and $\mathcal{M}\mapsto {}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$
on classes of maps 
are contravariant and mutually adjoint.
It follows
that the operations
$\mathcal{M}\mapsto ({}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M})^\pitchfork$
and $\mathcal{M}\mapsto {}^\pitchfork(\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork)$
are closure operators.




+-- {: .num_lemma #scholieselflift}
######Lemma
The following conditions on a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$
are equivalent:

$$f \mathrm{is}\:\mathrm{invertible}, \quad \mathbf{E}\,\pitchfork\, f, 
\quad f\,\pitchfork\, f, \quad f\,\pitchfork\, \mathbf{E}.$$ 
=--



+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
($1\Rightarrow 2$)
If $f$ is invertible, then the square
\begin{xymatrix}
A  \ar[d]_u \ar[r]^{x}  & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
B \ar[r]_{y}         & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $f^{-1}y:B\to X$.
Thus, $u\,\pitchfork\, f$ for any arrow $u$, and hence 
$\mathbf{E}\,\pitchfork\, f$.
($2\Rightarrow 3$) If $\mathbf{E}\,\pitchfork\, f$, then 
$f\,\pitchfork\,f$. 
($3\Rightarrow 1$) If $f\,\pitchfork\,f$, then the square
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[d]_f \ar@{=}[r]  &   X  \ar[d]^f \\
Y \ar@{=}[r]         & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $g:Y\to X$ and this shows that $f$ is invertible.
The equivalences ($1\Leftrightarrow 2\Leftrightarrow 3$)
are proved. The equivalences ($1\Leftrightarrow 4\Leftrightarrow 3$)
are proved similarly.
=--



Recall that a map $u:A\to B$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$ is said to be 
a *retract* of another map $v:C\to D$,
if $u$ is a retract of $v$ in the category of arrows $\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.
The condition means that there exists four maps $p,i,q,j$ fitting in
a commutative diagram
\begin{xymatrix}A \ar[d]^u\ar[r]^i& C \ar[d]^v\ar[r]^p & A \ar[d]^u \\ 
B \ar[r]^j & D \ar[r]^q &  B
\end{xymatrix}
and such that $p i=1_A$ and $q j=1_B$.

###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under retracts* 
if every retract of a map in $\mathcal{M}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.
=--





We recall that the *base change* of a map $f:X\to Y$
along a map $v:V\to X$ is the map $g:U \to V$
in a pullback square,
\begin{xymatrix}
U  \ar[d]_g \ar[r]  & X \ar[d]^{f}  \\
V \ar[r]_{v}         & Y
\end{xymatrix}


Dually, the *cobase change* of a map $u:A\to B$
along a map $c:A\to C$ is the map $v:C\to D$
in a pushout square,
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{u} \ar[r]^{c} & C\ar[d]^{v}\\
B \ar[r]  & D.
\end{xymatrix}

###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under base changes* 
if the base change of a map in $\mathcal{M}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$,
when the base change exists.
The notion of a class of maps *closed under cobase changes* 
is defined dually.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #defcloseundercoproducts}
###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under coproducts* 
if the coproduct
$$\sqcup_{i\in I}u_i: \sqcup_{i\in I} A_i\to \sqcup_{i\in I} B_i$$
of any family of maps $(u_i:i\in I)$ in $\mathcal{M}$
belongs to $\mathcal{M}$, when this
coproduct exists.
The notion of a class of maps closed under products
is defined similarly.

+-- {: .num_lemma #closureofcomplementsfirst}
######Lemma
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a class of maps in a
category $\mathbf{E}$.
Then the class $\mathcal{M}^\bot$ contains the isomorphisms
and is closed under composition, retracts, products,
and base changes.
Dually, the class ${}^\bot\mathcal{M}$ is 
contains the isomorphisms and
is closed under composition, retracts, coproducts,
and cobase changes.
=--



+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof
That class ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$ contains the isomorphisms 
by Scholie \ref{scholieselflift}.
Let us show that it
is closed under composition. We shall use the
properties of [[Cartesian squares|epicartesian]] squares.
Let us show that if two morphisms $u:A\to B$ and $v:B\to C$
belongs to ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$, then so
does their composite $v u:A\to C$.
For any morphism $f:X\to Y$, the square $Sq(v u,f)$
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(C,X)   \ar[rr]^{hom(v u,X)} \ar[d]_{hom(C,f)}  & & hom(A,X)  \ar[d]^{hom(A,f)}  \\
hom(C,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(v u,Y)}      & & hom(A,Y),
\end{xymatrix}
can be obtained by composing horizontally the squares $Sq(u,f)$
and $Sq(v,f)$,
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(C,X)   \ar[rr]^{hom(v ,X)} \ar[d]_{hom(C,f)}  & &
hom(B,X)  \ar[d]_{hom(B,f)}  \ar[rr]^{hom(u,X)}  & & hom(A,X)  \ar[d]^{hom(A,f)}  \\
hom(C,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(v,Y)} & & hom(B,Y) \ar[rr]_{hom(u,Y)}      
& & hom(A,Y).
\end{xymatrix}
The squares $Sq(u,f)$
and $Sq(v,f)$ are epicartesian if $f\in \mathcal{M}$;
hence their composite is epicartesian by the lemma
[here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#cancelquasicartesian).
This shows that $v u\in {}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$.
We have proved that the class ${}^\pitchfork\mathcal{M}$
is closed under composition.
Let us now show that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ 
is closed under retracts.
If a map $f:X\to Y$ is a retract of a map $g:U\to V$,
then the square $Sq(u,f)$ is a retract of the square $Sq(u,g)$
for any map $u:A\to B$.
But a retract of an epicartesian square
is epicartesian by the lemma
[here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#retractquasicart). 
It follows that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is closed under retracts. Let us show that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$
is closed under products.
If a map $f:X\to Y$ is the product of a family of maps
$f_i:X_i\to Y_i$ ($i\in I$), then the square
$Sq(u,f)$ is the product of the family of 
squares $Sq(u,f_i)$.
But the product of a family of epicartesian 
squares is epicartesians by the lemma 
[here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#productquasicart}). 
This shows that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is closed under 
products. 
Let us show that the class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ 
is closed under base changes.
Suppose that we have a pullback square

\[
\label{01}
\]
\begin{xymatrix}
U \ar[d]_g \ar[r]^u  &  X  \ar[d]^f \\
V \ar[r]^v      & Y
\end{xymatrix}
with $f\in \mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ and let us prove
that $g\in \mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$.
It suffices to show that the square $Sq(u,g)$ 
is epicartesian for every morphism $u:A\to B$
in $\mathcal{M}$. But the
square is the back face of the following 
commutative cube,
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(B,U) \ar[rr] \ar[dd] \ar[dr] &   & hom(A,U)  \ar[dr]  \ar '[d] [dd]  & \\ &  hom(B,X)\ar[dd]\ar[rr] &   & hom(A,X) \ar[dd] \\ 
 hom(B,V) \ar[dr] \ar '[r] [rr]&  &   hom(A,V) \ar[dr] &  \\ 
& hom(B,Y)  \ar[rr] &   & hom(A,Y) .
\end{xymatrix}
The left and the right faces of the cube are cartesian,
since the square (eq:01) is cartesian and the
functors $hom(A,-)$ and $hom(B,-)$ preserve limits.
The front face is epicartesian
since we have $u\pitchfork p$.
Hence the back face is epicartesian by the cube
lemma [here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#cubelemmaquasicart).

###### Proposition
The two classes of a weak factorisation system $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ contain the isomorphisms and they
are closed under composition and retracts. 
The right class $\mathcal{R}$ is closed
under base changes and products, and
the left class $\mathcal{L}$ 
under cobase changes and coproducts.
The intersection $\mathcal{L}\,\cap \,\mathcal{R}$ is the class of isomorphisms.

######Proof
This follows from Lemma \ref{closureofcomplementsfirst}

since $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork$

######Definition
Recall that a map $u:A\to B$ in a category $\mathbf{E}$  is said to be
a *domain retract*
of a map $v:C\to B$,
if the object $(A,u)$ of the category $\mathbf{E}/B$ is a retract of
the object $(C,v)$.
There is a dual notion of *codomain retract*.

###### Definition
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$
in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is *closed under domain retracts* 
if every domain retract of a map in $\mathcal{M}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$.
The notion of a class closed under codomain retract is defined similarly.
=--





+-- {: .num_prop #WFS2}
######Theorem
A pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ 
of classes of maps in a category $\mathbf{E}$ is a 
weak factorisation system iff the following conditions are satisfied:

* every map $f:X\to Y$ admits a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-factorisation 
$f=p u:X\to E\to Y$; 
* $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}$;
* the class $\mathcal{L}$ is closed under codomain retracts
and the class $\mathcal{R}$ under domain retracts.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
The implication ($\Rightarrow$) is clear since the classes of a weak factorisation
system are closed under retracts by Proposition
\ref{ClosureofleftandrightclassesWFS}.
Let us prove the implication ($\Leftarrow$).
We have $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{L}^\pitchfork $
since we have $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{R}$ by the hypothesis.
Let us show that we have $\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork \subseteq \mathcal{R}$.
If a map $f:X\to Y$ belongs to $\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork$, let us choose
a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-factorisation $f=p u:X\to E\to Y$.
The square
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[d]_u \ar@{=}[r] & X  \ar[d]^f\\
E  \ar[r]^p    & Y
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $r:E\to X$ since we have 
$u\,\pitchfork\, f$.
Hence we have $f r=p$ and $r u =1_X$
and this shows that $f$ is a domain retract of $p$.
Thus, $f\in \mathcal{R}$, since $\mathcal{R}$
is closed under domain retracts by hypothesis. 
=--



Recall that a class $\mathcal{C}$ of objects in a category $\mathbf{E}$
is said to be *replete* if every object isomorphic to an object
in $\mathcal{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{C}$.
We shall say that a class of maps $\mathcal{M}$ 
in $\mathbf{E}$ is **replete**,
if it is replete as a class of objects of the category
$\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.




+-- {: .num_prop #incompleteWFS}
######Corollary
Suppose that a pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ of classes
of maps  in a category $\mathbf{E}$ satisfies the
following three conditions:

* every map $f:X\to Y$ admits a $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$-factorisation 
$f=p u:X\to E\to Y$; 

* $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}$;

* the classes $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
are replete. 

If $\mathcal{L}'$ denotes the class of maps which are codomain retracts
of maps in $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{R}'$ denotes the class of 
maps which are domain retracts of maps in $\mathcal{R}$,
then the pair $(\mathcal{L}',\mathcal{R}')$
is a weak factorisation system.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
The condition  $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}$
implies the condition $\mathcal{L}'\,\pitchfork\,\mathcal{R}'$
by Lemma \ref{closureofcomplementsfirst}.
It is easy to see that $\mathcal{L}'$
is closed under codomain retracts,
and that $\mathcal{R}'$ is closed under domain retracts.
The result then follows from Theorem \ref{WFS2}.

######Definition
For any ordinal $\alpha$, let us put $[\alpha]=\{i :0\le i \le \alpha \}$
and $[\alpha)=\{i :0\le i \lt \alpha \}$.
Let $\mathbf{E}$ be a cocomplete category.
We shall say that a functor $C:[\alpha] \to  \mathbf{E}$
is a *chain of lentgth* $\alpha$, or an $\alpha$-*chain*.
The *composite* of $C$ 
is defined to be the canonical map $C(0)\to C( \alpha)$.
The *base* of $C$ is the restriction of $C$ to $[\alpha)$. 
The chain $C$ is *cocontinuous* 
if the canonical map 
$$ \mathrm{colim}_{i\lt j} C(i)\to C(j)$$

We shall say that a subcategory $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbf{E}$

######Lemma
The class $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$ is closed
under transfinite op-compositions for any
class of maps $\mathcal{M}$ in a complete category $\mathbf{E}$.
=--


+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
Let us show that if $\alpha \gt 0$ is a limit ordinal
then every continuous op-chain $C:[\alpha]\to \mathbf{E}$
with a base in $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $
has its composite in $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $.
Let us denote by $c(j,i)$ the transition map $C(j)\to C(i)$
defined for $0\le i\le j\le \alpha$.
For any morphism $u:A\to B$, let us denote
by $Sq(u,C)$ the contravariant functor 
$[\alpha]\to  \mathbf{Set}^I$ obtained
by putting $Sq(u,C)(i)=hom(u,C(i)):hom(B,C(i))\to hom(A,C(i))$
for $i\in [\alpha]$.
By definition, the functor $Sq(u,C)$ takes a pair $i\leq j$
to the square $Sq(u,c(j,i))$,
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(B,C(j))  \ar[rr]^{hom(u,C(j))}  \ar[d]_{hom(B,c(j,i))}   
& &  hom(A,C(j))  \ar[d]^{hom(A,c(j,i))}  \\
hom(B,C(i)) \ar[rr]_{hom(u,C(i))}     & & hom(A,C(i)).
\end{xymatrix}
Beware that here the square $Sq(u,c(j,i))$
is defining a morphism from
the its top horizontal line to the bottom horizontal line;
this means that we are presently using the vertical composition
in the category of squares).
The (vertical) op-chain $Sq(u,C):[\alpha]\to  \mathbf{Set}^I$
is continuous, since $C$ is continuous. 
If $u\in \mathcal{M}$, then 
the square $Sq(u,c(j,i))$ is epicartesian 
for every $i\leq j\lt \alpha$ by the assumption on $C$.
It follows that the square $Sq(u,c(\alpha,0))$ is epicartesian by the lemma [here](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Cartesian+squares#transfiniteopcompquasicart).
This show that $c(\alpha,0)$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork $,
and hence that $\mathcal{M}^\pitchfork$
is closed under transfinite op-compositions.

######Lemma
A cellular class of maps is closed under coproducts. 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a cellular class of maps in a 
cocomplete category $\mathbf{E}$.
We shall say that an object $A\in \mathbf{E}$
*cofibrant*, if the map $\bot \to A$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$,
where $\bot$ is the initial object of $\mathbf{E}$.
We shall first prove that the coproduct of a
family of cofibrant objects is cofibrant. 
Let us first show that the coproduct of a finite
family of cofibrant objects is cofibrant.
The identity map $\bot \to \bot$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$,
since $\mathcal{M}$ contains the isomorphisms.
Hence the object $\bot $ is cofibrant.
This show that the coproduct of the empty
family of objects is cofibrant.
It remains to show that the coproduct of a finite
non-empty family of cofibrant objects is cofibrant.
For this it suffices to show that the coproduct
of two cofibrant objects is cofibrant.
If $A$ and $B$ are cofibrant, 
consider the pushout square
\begin{xymatrix}
\bot \ar[r]\ar[d]&  B \ar[d]^{i_B} \\
A   \ar[r]^(0.4){i_A}&  A\sqcup B .
\end{xymatrix}
The map $i_B$ is a cobase change
of the map $\bot \to A$. Thus, $i_B\in \mathcal{M}$,
since $A$ is cofibrant and $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under cobase change.
The map $\bot \to B$ also belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$, since $B$ is cofibrant.
Hence the composite $\bot \to B\to  A\sqcup B$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$,
since $ \mathcal{M}$ is closed under composition.
This shows that $ A\sqcup B$ is cofibrant.
Let us now show that the coproduct 
$$A= \bigsqcup_{i\in I} A_i  $$
of an infinite family of cofibrant objects $(A_i:i\in I)$ is cofibrant.
We shall argue by induction on the ordinal $\alpha=\mathrm{Card}(I)$. 
If $j\lt \alpha$, let us put
$$C(j)=\bigsqcup_{i\lt j} A_i.$$
There is an obvious canonical map $C(j)\to C(k)$
for $j\le k \le \alpha$ and
this defines a cocontinuous chain $C:[\alpha] \to \mathbf{E}$.
Notice that $C(0)=\bot$ and $C(\alpha)=A$.
Hence we can  prove that $A$ is cofibrant by showing
that the composite of $C$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$.
For this it suffices to show that the base of $C$ belongs to 
$ \mathcal{M}$, since $ \mathcal{M}$
is closed under transfinite compositions.
But the object
$$C(j,k)=\bigsqcup_{j\le i\lt k} A_i$$
is cofibrant for every $j\le k\lt \alpha$
by the induction hypothesis, since $k\lt \alpha$. 
And the transition map $C(j)\to C(k)$ is a base change
of the map $\bot \to C(j,k)$
since we have a pushout square
\begin{xymatrix}
\bot \ar[r]\ar[d]&  C(j) \ar[d] \\
C(j,k)  \ar[r]&  C(k).
\end{xymatrix} 
This shows that the transition map $C(j)\to C(k)$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$
for every $j\le k\lt \alpha$.
We have proved that the base of $C$
belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$ and hence that the object $A$ is cofibrant.
Let us now show that the class $ \mathcal{M}$ is closed under coproducts.
For this, let us show that the coproduct $u:A\to B$ of a family of maps 
$u_i:A_i\to B_i$ ($i\in I$) in $ \mathcal{M}$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$.
For this, let us denote by $ \mathcal{M}'$ the class of maps in the category 
$A\backslash  \mathbf{E}$ whose underlying map in $\mathbf{E}$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$.
It is easy to verify that the class $ \mathcal{M}'$ satisfies the hypothesis
of the proposition. 
Let us put $E_i=B_i\sqcup_{A_i}A$ for each $i\in I$,
\begin{xymatrix}
A_i\ar[r]\ar[d]_{u_i}&  A \ar[d]^{v_i} \\
B_i  \ar[r] & E_i.
\end{xymatrix} 
The object $(B,u)$ of $A\backslash \mathbf{E}$
is the coproduct of the family of objects $(E_i,v_i)$ for $i\in I$.
The map $v_i:A\to E_i$ belongs to $ \mathcal{M}$, since $u_i\in \mathcal{M}$ by assumption, and since the class $ \mathcal{M}$ is closed under cobase change. Hence the object $(E_i,v_i)$ of the category $A\backslash \mathbf{E}$
is cofibrant with respect to the class $ \mathcal{M}'$.
It follows that the object $(B,u)$ is cofibrant by the first part of the proof. This proves that $u\in   \mathcal{M}$.

=--


+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof(Part 0)
We first explain the rough idea of proof in the case $\alpha=\omega$.
We begin by constructing a functor 
$$F:\mathbf{E}\to \mathbf{E}$$
together with a natural transformation $\theta:Id\to F$ 
having the following properties:
for every arrow $\sigma:A\to B$ in $\Sigma$ and every
map $x:A\to X$, there exists a map $x^\sigma:B\to F(X)$
fitting in a commutative square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{\sigma} \ar[r]^{x}  &  X \ar[d]^{\theta_X}\\
B  \ar[r]^(0.4){x^\sigma}  &  F(X).
\end{xymatrix}
The object $R(X)$ is then taken to be the colimit
of the infinite sequence,
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[r]^{\theta^0} & F(X) \ar[r]^{\theta^1}& F^2(X) \ar[r]^{\theta^2} & F^3(X)\ar[r] &\cdots
\end{xymatrix}
where $\theta^n=\theta_{F^n(X)}$,
and natural transformation $\rho:Id\to R$ is defined by the canonical map $X\to R(X)$. The nice properties of $\rho $
are deduced from the nice properties of $\theta$.
Let us show that the object $R(X)$ is $\Sigma$-fibrant.
If $v_n:F^n(X)\to R(X)$ denotes the canonical map,
then we have a commutative triangle
\begin{xymatrix}
F^n(X)  \ar[d]_{\theta^n} \ar[r]^{v_n}  & R(X)  \\
F^{n+1}(X)  \ar[ur]_{v_{n+1}}  &
\end{xymatrix}
for every $n\geq 0$.
The domain of every map $\sigma:A\to B$ in $\Sigma$
is compact by hypothesis. It follows that 
for every
map $x:A\to R(X)$,
there exist an integer $n\ge 0$ together with a map $y:A\to F^n(X)$ such that $x=v_n y$. 
But there is then a map $y^\sigma:B\to F^{n+1}(X)$
fitting in a commutative square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{\sigma} \ar[r]^{y}  &  F^nX \ar[d]^{\theta^n} \\
B  \ar[r]^(0.4){y^\sigma}  &  F^{n+1}(X).
\end{xymatrix}
If $z=v_{n+1}y^\sigma$, then
$z\sigma=v_{n+1}y^\sigma \sigma =v_{n+1} \theta^n y= v_{n} y=x.$
This shows that $R(X)$ is $\Sigma$-fibrant.
Let us describe the construction of the functor $F$ in the case
where $\Sigma$ consists of a single map $\sigma:A\to B$.
If $E$ is a set we shall denote by $E\times A$
the coproduct of $E$ copies of $A$. 
The functor $E\mapsto E\times A$ is left adjoint 
to the functor  $X\mapsto hom(A,X)$.
Let $\epsilon(A,X):hom(A,X)\times A\to X$
be the counit of the adjunction.
By definition, we have $\epsilon(A,X)i_x=x$ for every
$x:A\to X$, where $i_x:A\to hom(A,X)\times A$
is the inclusion indexed by $x$.
The object $F(X)$ and the map $\theta_X:X\to F(X)$ 
are then defined by a pushout square
\begin{xymatrix}
hom(A,X)\times A  \ar[d]_{hom(A,X)\times \sigma}
 \ar[rr]^(0.7){\epsilon(A,X)} &  &  X \ar[d]^{\theta_X} \\
hom(A,X)\times B  \ar[rr] &  &  F(X),
\end{xymatrix}
For every map $x:A\to X$, the composite of the squares
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[rr]^(0.3){i_x}\ar[d]_\sigma & & hom(A,X)\times A  
\ar[d]_{hom(A,X)\times \sigma} \ar[rr]^(0.7){\epsilon(A,X)}  &  & 
 X \ar[d]^{\theta_X} \\
B\ar[rr]^(0.3){i_x}&  &  hom(A,X)\times B  \ar[rr]  &  &  F(X),
\end{xymatrix}
is a square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{\sigma} \ar[r]^{x}  &  X \ar[d]^{\theta_X}\\
B  \ar[r]^(0.4){x^\sigma}  &  F(X).
\end{xymatrix}
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof(Part 1) 
We now give a full proof in the case $\alpha=\omega$.
For every object $X\in \mathbf{E}$ 
let us put
$$S(X)=\bigsqcup_{\sigma\in \Sigma}  hom(s(\sigma),X)\,\times\, s(\sigma)$$
where $s(\sigma)$ is the source of the map $\sigma$.
This defines a functor $S:\mathbf{E}\to \mathbf{E}.$
The counits 
$$\epsilon(s(\sigma),X):hom(s(\sigma), X)\,\times\, s(\sigma) \to X$$
induces a map $\epsilon_X:S(X)\to X$.
This defines a natural transformation $\epsilon:S\to Id$,
where $Id$ denotes the identity functor.
By definition, if $\sigma:A\to B$ is a map in $\Sigma$, then for every
map $x:A\to X$ we have $\epsilon_X i_{(\sigma,x)}=x$,
where $i_{(\sigma,x)}:A\to S(X)$
is the inclusion indexed by $(\sigma,x)$.
For every object $X\in \mathbf{E}$ let us put 
$$T(X)=  \bigsqcup_{\sigma\in \Sigma} 
hom(s({\sigma}),X)\,\times\, t({\sigma}),$$
where $t(\sigma)$ is the target of the map $\sigma$.
This defines a functor $T:\mathbf{E}\to \mathbf{E}.$
The coproduct over $\sigma\in \Sigma$ of the maps 
$$hom(s(\sigma),X)\,\times\, \sigma: hom(s(\sigma),X)\,\times\, s(\sigma) \to 
hom(s({\sigma}),X)\,\times\, t({\sigma})$$
is a map $\phi_X:S(X)\to T(X)$. 
This defines a natural transformation $\phi:S\to T.$
Let us denote by $F(X)$ the object defined by
the pushout square
\begin{xymatrix}
S(X) \ar[d]_{\phi_X} \ar[rr]^{\epsilon_X}  &  &  X \ar[d]^{\theta_X}\\
T(X)  \ar[rr]  & &  F(X).
\end{xymatrix}
This defines a functor $F: \mathbf{E}\to  \mathbf{E}$ together
with a natural transformation $\theta:Id\to F$.
Observe that for every map $\sigma:A\to B$ in $\Sigma$ and every
map $x:A\to X$, the composite of the squares
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[rr]^{i_{(\sigma,x)}}\ar[d]_\sigma & & S(X)  
\ar[d]_{\phi_X} \ar[rr]^{\epsilon_X}  &  & 
 X \ar[d]^{\theta_X} \\
B\ar[rr]^{i_{(\sigma,x)}}&  &  T(X) \ar[rr]  &  &  F(X),
\end{xymatrix}
is a square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{\sigma} \ar[r]^{x}  &  X \ar[d]^{\theta_X}\\
B  \ar[r]^{x^\sigma}  &  F(X).
\end{xymatrix}
The colimit $R(X)$ 
of the infinite sequence
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[r]^{\theta^0} & F(X) \ar[r]^{\theta^1}& F^2(X) \ar[r]^{\theta^2} & F^3(X)\ar[r] &\cdots
\end{xymatrix}
is $\Sigma$-fibrant by the part 0 of the proof, where $\theta^n=\theta_{F^n(X)}$. 
Let us show that the canonical map $\rho_X:X\to R(X)$ 
belongs to $Cell^{\omega}(\Sigma)$.
For this it suffices to show that the maps $\theta_X$
belong to $Cell^{\omega}(\Sigma)$, since an $\omega$-cellular
class is closed under $\omega$-compositions.
But $\theta_X$ is a cobase change of $\phi_X$,
and $\phi_X$ is a coproduct of maps in $\Sigma$.
This shows that $\theta_X$ belongs to $Cell^{\omega}(\Sigma)$
by the closure preperties of this class of maps.
It remains to show that the functor $R$
preserves directed colimits. The functor $hom(A,-)$
preserves directed colimits for any compact object $A$.
Hence, also the functor $hom(A,-)\,\times\, B$
for any object $B$, since the functor $(-)\times B$
is cocontinuous. The functor $R$ is by construction
a colimit of functors of the form $hom(A,-)\,\times\, B$,
for compact objects $A$. It follows that $R$ preserves directed colimits.
This completes the proof of the proposition in the case
where $\alpha=\omega$.  
=--


+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof (Part 2) 
Let us now consider the case where $\alpha\gt \omega$. 
The sequence
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[r]^{\theta^0} & F(X) \ar[r]^{\theta^1}& F^2(X) \ar[r]^{\theta^2} & F^3(X)\ar[r] &\cdots
\end{xymatrix}
can be extended 
cocontinuously through all the
ordinals $\leq \alpha$ by putting 
$$F^j(X)=\mathrm{colim}_{i\lt j}  F^i(X)$$
for every limit ordinal $j \le \alpha$
and by putting $F^{j+1}(X)=F(F^{j}(X))$ and
$$\theta^j=\theta_{F^j(X)}:F^j(X)\to F^{j+1}(X)$$
for every ordinal $j \lt \alpha$.
Let us then put $R(X)=F^\alpha(X)$ and let $v_i:F^i(X)\to R(X)$
be the canonical map for $i \lt \alpha$.
This defines a functor $R:\mathbf{E}\to \mathbf{E}$
equipped with a natural transformation $\rho_X=v_0:X\to R(X)$.
Let us show that the object $R(X)$ is $\Sigma$-fibrant.
For every map $\sigma:A\to B$ in $\Sigma$ and every
map $x:A\to X$, there exist an ordinal $i \lt \alpha$ together with a map $y:A\to F^i(X)$ such that $x=v_i y$, since the object $A$
is $\alpha$-compact.
But there is then a map $y^\sigma:B\to F^{i+1}(X)$
fitting in a commutative square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{\sigma} \ar[r]^{y}  &  F^iX \ar[d]^{\theta^i} \\
B  \ar[r]^(0.4){y^\sigma}  &  F^{i+1}(X).
\end{xymatrix}
If $z=v_{i+1}y^\sigma$, then
$z\sigma=v_{i+1}y^\sigma \sigma =v_{i+1} \theta^i y= v_{i} y=x.$
This shows that $R(X)$ is $\Sigma$-fibrant.
We leave to the reader the verification that $\rho_X$
belongs to $Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$,
and the verification that the functor $R$ preserves $\alpha$-directed colimits.

If $\mathbf{E}$ is a category, then an object of the category 
$\mathbf{E}^{[2]}$ is a composable
pair of maps $A\to B\to C$ in the category $\mathbf{E}.$
There is then a composition functor 
$$\sigma_1:\mathbf{E}^{[2]}\to \mathbf{E}^{[1]}$$
which associates to a composable
pair $A\to B\to C$ its composite $A\to B$.
We shall say that a section 
$$F:\mathbf{E}^{[1]}\to \mathbf{E}^{[2]}$$
of the functor $\sigma_1$

It associates
to a map $f:A\to A'$ a factorisation $f=f_1f_0:A\to F(f)\to A'$,
and it takes a

Let $\Sigma$ be a set of maps in a cocomplete category $\mathbf{E}$.
If the domain and codomain of every map in $\Sigma$ is $\alpha$-compact
then there exists a factorisation functor 
$$F:\mathbf{E}^{[1]}\to \mathbf{E}^{[2]}$$
which associates to every morphism 
$f:A\to B$ a factorisation $f=f_1f_0: A\to F(f)\to B$
with $f_0\in Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$ and $f_1\in \Sigma^\pitchfork$.
Moreover, the functor $F$ preserves $\alpha$-directed colimits.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof 
We shall use Proposition \ref{Sigmafibrantreplacement}.
For any map $u:A\to B$ in $\mathbf{E}$,
let us denote by $\lambda(u)$ the square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{u} \ar[r]^{u}  &  B \ar[d]^{1_B}\\
B  \ar@{=}[r] &  B
\end{xymatrix}
viewed as a morphism $u\to 1_B$ in the category $\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.
If $f:X\to Y$ is a map in $\mathbf{E}$,
then the condition $u\,\pitchfork\, f$
exactly means that the map
$$Hom(\lambda(u),f): Hom(1_B,f)\to Hom(u,f)$$
is surjective and hence that $f$ is $\lambda(u)$-fibrant.
Hence a map $f:X\to Y$ belongs to $\Sigma^\pitchfork$
iff it is $\lambda(\Sigma)$-fibrant as an object of the category
$\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.
It is easy to verify that domain and codomain 
of a map in $\lambda(\Sigma)$ are $\alpha$-compact,
since this is true of the maps in $\Sigma$. 
It then follows from Proposition \ref{Sigmafibrantreplacement}
that we can construct a functor 
$$R:\mathbf{E}^{[1]}\to \mathbf{E}^{[1]}$$
together with a natural transformation $\rho:Id\to R$.
This yields a commutative square
\begin{xymatrix}
X \ar[d]_{f} \ar[rr]^{\rho_0(f)}  &  & R_0(f) \ar[d]^{R(f)}\\
Y \ar[rr]^{\rho_1(f)}  &  & R_1(f).
\end{xymatrix}
in the category $\mathbf{E}$ for every map $f:X\to Y$
in $\mathbf{E}$. 
The map $R(f)$ belongs to $\Sigma^\pitchfork$, since it is a
$\lambda(\Sigma)$-fibrant object of the category $\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$.
The morphism $\rho(f):f\to R(f)$ belongs to 
$Cell^{\alpha}(\lambda(\Sigma))$ for every map $f\in \mathbf{E}$ by Proposition \ref{Sigmafibrantreplacement}. 
Let us show that the map $\rho_0(f)$ belongs to 
$Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$ and that the map $\rho_1(f)$ is invertible. 
For this, let us denote by $\mathcal{C}$ the class of 
maps $u:A\to B$ in $\mathbf{E}^{[1]}$
\begin{xymatrix}
A_0 \ar[d]_{u} \ar[r]^{u_0}  &  B_0 \ar[d]\\
A_1 \ar[r]^{u_1}  &  B_1
\end{xymatrix}
for which $u_0\in Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$ and for which $u_1$ invertible.
The 
It is easy to verify that the class $\mathcal{C}$
is $\alpha$-cellular. Moreover, we have $\lambda(\Sigma)\subseteq \mathcal{C}$. It follows that we have
$Cell^{\alpha}(\lambda(\Sigma))\subseteq \mathcal{C}$.
Thus, the morphism $\rho(f):f\to R(f)$ belongs to $ \mathcal{C}$
for every $f$. Hence the map $\rho_0(f)$ belongs to 
$Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$ and the map $\rho_1(f)$ is invertible.
We can then construct a functorial factorisation

+-- {: .num_theorem #existenceofWFS}
######Theorem
Let $\Sigma$ be a set of maps between small objects in a cocomplete category $\mathbf{E}$. Then the pair $(Sat(\Sigma),\Sigma^\pitchfork)$
is a weak factorisation system.
Moreover, if $\Sigma$ is a set of maps between $\alpha$-compact objects, 
then every morphism in $Sat(\Sigma)$
is a codomain retract of a morphism in $Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$. 
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof 
We shall apply Proposition \ref{WFS2} to the classes 
$\mathcal{L}=Sat(\Sigma)$ and $\mathcal{R}=\Sigma^\pitchfork$.
The class $\mathcal{L}$ is closed under codomain retracts,
since it is saturated. The class $\mathcal{R}$
is closed under domain retracts by Proposition \ref{closureofcomplements}
since it is a right complement $\Sigma^\pitchfork$.
Let us show that we have $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{R}$.
We have $\Sigma \subseteq {}^\pitchfork(\Sigma^\pitchfork)=\mathcal{R}^\pitchfork$. Thus, $Sat(\Sigma)\subseteq \mathcal{R}^\pitchfork$,
since the class $\mathcal{R}^\pitchfork$ is saturated
by Proposition \ref{leftsaturatedissaturated}.
This proves that $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{R}$.
Let us choose a regular cardinal $\alpha$ for which
$\Sigma$ is a set of maps between $\alpha$-compact objects.
It then follows from Proposition \ref{functorialfibrantreplacement}
that every map $f:X\to Y$
admits a factorisation $f=p u:X\to E\to Y$
with $u\in Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$ and $p\in \mathcal{R}$.
But we have $Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)\subseteq Sat(\Sigma)$
since a saturated class is $\alpha$-cellular for any
regular cardinal $\alpha$ by Lemma \ref{saturatedarecoproductclosed} 
This shows that $u\in \mathcal{L}$
and hence that the pair $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$
is a weak factorisation system by Proposition \ref{WFS2}.
It remains to prove that every morphism in $\mathcal{L}$
is a codomain retract of a morphism in $Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$. 
If $u:A\to B$ belongs to $\mathcal{L}$,
let us choose a factorisation $u=p v:X\to E\to Y$
with $v\in Cell^{\alpha}(\Sigma)$ and $r\in \mathcal{R}$.
The square
\begin{xymatrix}
A \ar[d]_{u} \ar[r]^{v}  &  E \ar[d]^r\\
B \ar@{=}[r]   &  B
\end{xymatrix}
has a diagonal filler $s:B\to E$, since we have $u\pitchfork r$.
This shows that $u$ is a codomain retract of $v$.

Let $F:\mathbf{C}\leftrightarrow \mathbf{D}:G$ be a pair of adjoint functors

If $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is a weak factorisation system
in the category $\mathbf{C}$ and $(\mathcal{L}',\mathcal{R}')$ 
a weak factorisation system
in $\mathbf{D}$, then the two conditions
$$F(\mathcal{L})\subseteq \mathcal{L}'\quad \mathrm{and}
\quad G(\mathcal{R}')\subseteq \mathcal{R} $$
are equivalent.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
The condition $F(\mathcal{L})\subseteq \mathcal{L}'$ is equivalent
to the condition $F(\mathcal{L})\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{R}'$,
since $\mathcal{L}'={}^\pitchfork\mathcal{R}'$.
But the condition $F(\mathcal{L})\,\pitchfork\, \mathcal{R}'$
is equivalent to the condition $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\, G(\mathcal{R}')$
by Lemma \ref{adjointfunctorliftingprop}.
But the condition $\mathcal{L}\,\pitchfork\, G(\mathcal{R}')$
is equivalent to the condition $G(\mathcal{R}')\subseteq \mathcal{R}$,
since $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{L}^\pitchfork$.
