In [[higher category theory]], the _exchange law_, or _interchange law_, states that the multiple ways of composing higher morphisms are the same.

You should be able to see it in action at [[bicategory]], but not enough detail has been written there yet!

In even higher (and non-[[semi-strict n-category|semi-strict]]) category theory, the interchange law becomes a higher morphism itself: the _exchanger_.
