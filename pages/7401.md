## Idea

Generalized Reedy model structures are a class of [[model categories]] that generalize the [[Reedy model structures]] when the underlying [[site]] is generalized from a [[Reedy category]] to a [[generalized Reedy category]].

So these model structures serve to present [[(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-functors]] on generalized Reedy categories.

## Definition

Let $S$ be a (Cisinski-Moerdijk) [[generalized Reedy category]].
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with small [[limits]] and [[colimits]].

### The model structure

+-- {: .num_defn #FirstNotation}
###### Definition

For every [[object]] $s \in S$, every [[functor]] $X : S \to \mathcal{C}$ and every [[natural transformation]] $\phi : X \to Y$ write 

* $S^+(s)$ for the [[full subcategory]] of the [[slice category]] $S^+/s$ on the non-invertible morphisms into $s$;

* $S^-(s)$ for the [[full subcategory]] of the [[under category]] $s/S^-$ on the non-invertible morphisms out of $s$;

* $L_s(X) := {\lim_\to}_{(r \to s) \in S^+(s)} X(r)$ for the [[colimit]] of $X$ over $S^+(s)$, called the **latching object** of $X$ at $s$;

* $M_s(X) := {\lim_\leftarrow}_{(s \to r) \in S^-(s)} X(r)$ for the [[limit]] of $X$ over $S^-(s)$, called the **matching object** of $X$ at $s$.

* $X_s \coprod_{L_s(X)} L_s(Y) \to Y_s$ for the universal morphism induced from the morphism $L_s(X) \to X_s$, called the **relative latching map** of $\phi$ at $s$;

* $X_s \to M_s(X) \prod_{M_s(Y)} Y_s$ for the dual universal morphism, called the **relative matching map** of $\phi$ at $s$.

=--

See _[[Joyal-Tierney calculus]]_ for more on these kinds of objects and morphisms.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

In the above situation, the [[automorphism]] group $Aut_S(s)$ of $s$ canonically acts on all objects that appear, and all morphisms that appear respect this action.

Equivalently this means that for all $s$ the above objects and morphisms take place in the presheaf category $[B Aut(s), \mathcal{C}]$.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #ReedyModelStructure}
###### Definition

Let $S$ be a (Cisinski-Moerdijk)-[[generalized Reedy category]]. And let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[cofibrantly generated model category]]. Write $[S, \mathcal{C}]$ for the [[category of presheaves]] on $S^{op}$ with values in $\mathcal{C}$.

Call a morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $[S, \mathcal{C}]$

* a **Reedy cofibration** if for each $s \in S$ the relative latching map 

  $$
    X_s \coprod_{L_s(X)} L_s(Y) \to Y_s
  $$

  is a cofibration in $[B Aut(s), \mathcal{C}]_{proj}$;

* a **Reedy fibration** if for each $s \in S$ the relative matching map 

  $$
    X_s \to M_s(X) \prod_{M_s(Y)} Y_s
  $$

  is a fibration in $\mathcal{C}$;

* a **Reedy weak equivalence** if for each $s \in S$ the morphism

  $$
    f_s : X_s \to Y_s
  $$

  is a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{C}$;

where $[B Aut(r), \mathcal{C}]_{proj}$ is the projective [[model structure on functors]].

=--

### Global latching objects
 {#GlobalLatchingObjects}

We discuss here an alternative way of speaking about the latching objects, one where all indices at a given degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are unified.

Recall from def. \ref{FirstNotation} that for $s \in S$ we write $S^+(s)$
for the category of non-invertible degree-increasing morphisms into $s$. We introduce the union of these categories over all objects of a fixed degree.

+-- {: .num_defn #SecondNotation}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $S^+(n) = \coprod_{d(r) = n} S^+(r)$;

* $d_ n : S^+((n)) \to S$ for the restriction of the [[domain opfibration]] to objects that are non-invertible morphisms in $S^+$ with codomain in degree $n$ and to morphisms whose codomain is invertible, i.e. to diagrams of the form

  $$
    \array{
       a &\to& b
       \\
       \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in S^+}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in S^+}} & not\, invertible
       \\
       s & \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} & s' & deg = n
    }
    \,;
  $$

* $k_n : S^+(n) \hookrightarrow S^+((n))$ for the [[full subcategory]] inclusion on constant codomains;

* $G_n(S) \subset Core(S)$ for the [[groupoid]] of objects of dgree $n$ and [[isomorphisms]] between them.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The above categories and functors arrange into a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{d_n}{\leftarrow}& S^+((n)) &\stackrel{cod}{\to}& G_n(S)
    &\stackrel{j_n}{\to}& S
    \\
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{i_n}}\uparrow && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{i_n}}
    \\
    && S^+(n) &\stackrel{cod}{\to}& Obj(S)_n
  }  
  \,,
$$

where the vertical morphisms are (non-full) inclusions and the square is a [[pullback]] of an [[opfibration]].  Therefore it satisfies the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] so that we have a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  cod_! i^* \simeq i^* cod_!
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_defn #GlobalLatching}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $X \in [S, \mathcal{C}]$. Write 

* $X_n := j_n^* X \in [G_n(S), \mathcal{C}]$;

* the **$n$th latching object** is 

  $$
    L_n(X) := cod_! d_n^* X \in [G_n(S), \mathcal{C}]
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $s \in Obj(S)_n$ we have

$$
  L_n(X) : s \mapsto L_s(X)
  \,.

### Skeleta and coskeleta
 {#SkeletaAndCoskeleta}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write 

$$
  t_n : S_{\leq n}  \hookrightarrow S
$$ 

for the [[full subcategory]]
on the objects of degree $\leq n$.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Left and right [[Kan extension]] along $t_n$ defines an [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  ((t_n)_! \dashv t_n^* \dashv (t_n)_*)
  :
   [S_{\leq n},\mathcal{C}] \stackrel{\overset{(t_n)_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{t_n^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{(t_n)_*}{\hookrightarrow}}}
  [S,\mathcal{C}]
  \,.
$$


The induced [[monads]]

$$
  (sk_n \dashv cosk_n)
  : 
  [S,\mathcal{C}]
    \stackrel{\overset{(t_n)_!}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{t_n^*}{\to}}
  [S_{\leq n},\mathcal{C}]
    \stackrel{\overset{t_n^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{(t_n)_*}{\to}}
  [S,\mathcal{C}]
$$

are the **$n$-[[skeleton]]** and **$n$-[[coskeleton]]** functors, respectively.

Define for all $X \in [S, \mathcal{C}]$ the notation $sk_{-1}X$ to denote the [[initial object]] and $cosk_{-1}X$ the [[terminal object]].

=--

The $((t_n)_! \dashv t_n^*)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]] and the $(t_n^* \dashv (t_n)_*)$-unit induces [[natural transformations]]

$$
  sk_n \to id
$$

$$
  id \to cosk_n
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_lemma #LatchingIsSkeleton}
###### Lemma

The degree-$n$th latching object, def. \ref{GlobalLatching}, is isomorphic to the $(n-1)$-skeleton, and dually, the degree-$n$ matching object is isomorphic to the $(n-1)$-coskeleton. Under these identifications the canonical morphisms on both sides match

$$
  Latch_n(X) \simeq sk_{n-1}(X) 
$$

$$
  Match_n(X) cosk_{n-1}(X)
$$


=--

This is ([Ber-Moer, lemma 6.2](#BergerMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .num_lemma #coSkeletonTower}
###### Lemma

There are towers of [[natural trasnsformations]]

$$
  \emptyset \to sk_0 X \to sk_1 X \to sk_2 X \to \cdots \to X
  \,,
$$

and

$$
  X \to \cdots \to cosk_2 X \to cosk_1 X \to cosk_0 X \to *
  \,,
$$

that exhibit $X$ as the [[colimit]] of its skeleton tower and as the [[limit]] of its coskeleton tower.

=--

This is ([Ber-Moer, lemma 6.3](#BergerMoerdijk)).


(...)

## Proof of the model category axioms

We discuss that for $S$ a Berger-Moerdijk-[[generalized Reedy category]] and $\mathcal{C}$ a [[cofibrantly generated model category]], def. \ref{ReedyModelStructure} indeed defines a [[model category]] structure on the [[functor category]] $[S,\mathcal{C}]$.

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem 

Def. \ref{ReedyModelStructure} indeed defines a [[model category|model structure]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that $[S,\mathcal{C}]$ has all limits and colimits (as for any [[category of presheaves]] they are computed objectwise in $\mathcal{E}$) and that the weak equivalences satisfy [[two-out-of-three]], since the weak equivalences in $\mathcal{E}$ do. Also, all three classes of morphisms are closed under [[retracts]], since, for instance, the relative latching morphism of a retract is the retract of a relative latching morphism and so the property follows with the retract-closure of the classes of morphisms in $\mathcal{E}$.

It remains to show that the relevant lifting and factorization properties hold. This we discuss in a list of lemmas below in _[Lifting](#Lifting)_ and _[Factorization](#Factorization)_.

=--

### Lifting 
 {#Lifting}

We work with the "global" latching objects from [above](#GlobalLatchingObjects).

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Observation

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $[S, \mathcal{C}]_{gReedy}$ is a Reedy cofibration
precisely if for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the global relative latching morphism, def. \ref{GlobalLatching}

$$
  X_n \coprod_{L_n(X)} L_n(Y) \to Y_n
$$

is a cofibration in $[G_n(S), \mathcal{C}]$.

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #ExtraPropertyOfAcyclicCofibrations}
###### Lemma

Let $f : X \to Y$ in $[S, \mathcal{C}]$ be an acyclic Reedy cofibration. Then for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the morphism $Latch_n(f) : Latch_n(X) \to Latch_n(Y)$ is over each $s \in S$ an acyclic cofibration in $\mathcal{C}$

Dually, let $f : X \to Y$ in $[S, \mathcal{C}]$ be an acyclic Reedy fibration. Then for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the morphism $Match_n(f) : Match_n(X) \to Match_n(Y)$ is over each $s \in S$ an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{C}$


=--

This is ([Ber-Moer, lemma 5.3 and lemma 5.5](#BergerMoerdijk)).




+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

In the generalized Reedy model structure, def. \ref{ReedyModelStructure}, 

* acylcic cofibrations have the [[left lifting property]] agains fibrations;

* cofibrations have the [[left lifting property]] agains acyclic fibrations.


=--

This is ([Ber-Moer, lemma 5.2, lemma 5.4](#BergerMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We show the first clause. The second is dual. So let $f : X \to Y$ be an acyclic cofibration and let $g : Y \to X$ be a fibration.
We will exhibit a lift in any commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{}{\to}& X
  }
$$

by inductively constructing lifts in its image under $t_n^*$ (restriction to objects of degree $\leq n$, see [above](#SkeletaAndCoskeleta)).

First consider the case $n = 0$. Since $L_0(X) = \emptyset$ for all $X$, the fact that 

$$
  A_0 \coprod_{L_0(A)} L_0(B) \to B_0
$$

is a cofibration in $[G_0, \mathcal{C}]$ by assumption, means that in fact $f_0 : A_0 \to B_0$ is an acyclic cofibration here. Similarly $Y_0 \o X_0$ is a fibration there. But $G_0(S) = S_{\leq 0}$ and so the restriction of the lifting problem along $t_0$

$$
  \array{
    A_0 &\stackrel{}{\to}& Y_0
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    B_0 &\stackrel{}{\to}& X_0
  }
$$

is a lifting problem in $[G_0(S), \mathcal{C}]_{proj}$ of an acyclic cofibration against a fibration, and hence has a filler $\gamma_0 : B_0 \to Y_0$ there.

Now assume that a fillier $\gamma_{\leq (n-1)}$ in 

$$
  \array{
    A_{\leq (n-1)} &\stackrel{}{\to}& Y_{\leq (n-1)}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    B_{\leq (n-1)} &\stackrel{}{\to}& X_{\leq (n-1)}
  }
$$

has been found. By lemma \ref{LatchingIsSkeleton} this induces maps $Latch_n(B) \to Latch_{Y}$ and $Match_n(B) \to Match_n(Y)$ from which we can build the commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    A_n \coprod_{Latch_n A} Latch_n B
    &\to&
    Y_n
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B_n &\to& X_n \times_{Match_n X} Match_n Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Staring at this for a while (...) one sees that a lift of this in $[G_n, \mathcal{C}]$ completes the induction step. 

By assumption the left vertical morphism is a cofibration in $[G_n, \mathcal{C}]_{proj}$, and the right vertical morphism is a fibration there. It is now sufficient to show that the left morphism is also a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{E}$ over each $s \in S$.

By lemma \ref{ExtraPropertyOfAcyclicCofibrations} we know that $L_n(f)_s$ is an acyclic cofibration in $\mathcal{C}$ for all $s$. Hence so is its pushout $A_s \to 
(A_s \coprod_{L_n(A)_s} L_n(B)_s)$. The morphism $v_n(s)$ finally sits in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    A_r &\stackrel{f_r}{\to}&
    \\
    \downarrow  & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{v_n(s)}}
    \\
    (A_s \coprod_{L_n(A)_s} L_n(B)_s)
  }
$$ 

and so is a weak equivalence by [[two-out-of-three]].

## Properties

### Skeletal filtration and coskeleton tower

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $S$ be a Berger-Moerdijk-[[generalized Reedy category]] and $\mathcal{C}$ any [[model category]]. Let $X \in [S, \mathcal{C}]$ and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $k \lt l \leq \infty$. Recall the skeleta/coskeleta towers from lemma \ref{coSkeletonTower}.

1. If $X$ is Reedy cofibrant according to def. \ref{ReedyModelStructure} then all $sk_n X$ are Reedy cofibrant and the canonical morphisms $sk_k X \to sk_l X$ are Reedy cofibrations. 

1. If $X$ is Reedy fibrant according to def. \ref{ReedyModelStructure} then all $cosk_n X$ are Reedy fibrant and the canonical morphisms $cosk_l X \to cosk_k X$ are Reedy fibrations. 


=--

This is ([Ber-Moer, prop. 6.5](#BergerMoerdijk)).

### Relation to other model structures

(...)

## Example

* Every ordinary [[Reedy category]] is a generalized Reedy category, and in this case the above model structure reduces to the traditional [[Reedy model structure]].

* The [[model structure for dendroidal complete Segal spaces]] is a [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the generalized Reedy model structure over the [[tree category]].
