A [[geometric definition of higher category]].

The special case of [[(infinity,n)-category]] for $n=2$.

Models include 

* the definition by [[Carlos Simpson]] and Tamsamani;

* the definition in terms of [[n-fold Segal space]]s;

* a definition in terms of scaled simplicial sets, following Verity's [[simplicial model for weak omega-categories]] by Jacob Lurie (see reference below)
