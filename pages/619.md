A full [[subcategory]] is **reflective** if its inclusion functor has a [[adjunction|left adjoint]].  The left adjoint is sometimes called the _reflector_.

A reflective subcategory is always closed under [[limit|limits]], and inherits [[colimit|colimits]] from the larger category by application of the reflector.

When the reflector is a [[monomorphism]], a reflective category is often thought of as a full category of *complete* objects in some sense; the reflector takes each object in the ambient category to its completion.  Example: Complete metric spaces within metric spaces.
