## Idea

The [[Lie group]] $G_2$ is one (or rather: three) of the [[exceptional Lie groups]]. One way to characterize it is as the [[automorphism group]] of the [[octonions]]. Another way to characterize it is as the [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL(7)$ of those elements that preserve the canonical [[differential n-form|differential 3-form]]  $\langle ,(-)\times (-) \rangle$ on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^7$. As such, the group $G_2$ is a higher analog of the [[symplectic group]] (which is the group that preserves a canonical 2-form on any $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$), obtained by passing from [[symplectic geometry]] to [[2-plectic geometry]].

###### Definition

On the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^7$ consider the constant [[differential n-form|differential 3-form]]  $\omega \in \Omega^3(\mathbb{R}^7)$ given on tangent vectors $u,v,w \in \mathbb{R}^7$ by

$$
  \omega(u,v,w) \coloneqq \langle u , v \times w\rangle
  \,,
$$

where

* $\langle -,-\rangle$ is the canonical [[bilinear form]] 

* $(-)\times(-)$ is the [[cross product]] of vectors.

Then the group $G_2 \hookrightarrow GL(7)$ is the [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] acting on $\mathbb{R}^7$ which preserves the canonical [[orientation]] and preserves this 3-form $\omega$. Equivalently, it is the subgroup preserving the orientation and the [[Hodge star operator|Hodge dual]] differential 4-form $\star \omega$.

## Properts

### General

The inclusion $G_2 \hookrightarrow GL(7)$ of def. \ref{As2PlectomorphismsOnR7} factors through the [[special orthogonal group]]

$$
  G_2 \hookrightarrow SL(7) \hookrightarrow GL(7)
  \,.
$$

### Relation to higher prequantum geometry

The 3-form $\omega$ from def. \ref{As2PlectomorphismsOnR7} we may regard as equipping $\mathbb{R}^7$ with [[n-plectic geometry|2-plectic structure]]. From this point of view $G_2$ is the linear subgroup of the [[2-plectomorphism group]], hence (up to the translations) the image of the [[Heisenberg group]] of $(\mathbb{R}^7, \omega)$ in the symplectomorphism group.

Or, dually, we may regard the 4-form $\star \omega$ of def. \ref{As2PlectomorphismsOnR7} as being a [[n-plectic geometry|3-plectic structure]] and $G_2$ correspondingly as the linear part in the [[3-plectomorphism group]] of $\mathbb{R}^7$.
