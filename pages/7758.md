
A class $K$ of [[structure in model theory|structures]] of a given signature is an __elementary class__ if there is a [[first-order theory]] $T$ such that $K$ consists precisely of all models of $T$. 

There is a vast generalizations for higher-order theories (and more) [[abstract elementary class]], [[metric abstract elementary class]].
