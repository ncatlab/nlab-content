[[Charles Rezk]] has proposd a notion of weak [[(n,r)-category|(n+k,n)-category]], which he calls **$(n+k,n)$-Theta-spaces** . The $(n+k,n)$-Theta-spaces are precisely the fibrant objects of a certain [[model category]] structure on the category of [[simplicial presheaf|presheaves of simplicial sets]] on [[Andre Joyal]]'s category $\Theta_n$. This notion is a generalization of that of [[complete Segal space]]s (which are precisely the $(infty,1)$-$\Theta$-spaces).
