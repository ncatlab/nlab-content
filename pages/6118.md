## Idea

>One of my early Honours students at [[Macquarie University]] baffled his proposed Queensland graduate studies supervisor who asked whether the student knew the definition of a [[topological space]]. The aspiring researcher on [[dynamical system]]s answered positively: "Yes, it is a relational $\beta$-module!"  I received quite a bit of flak from colleagues concerning that one; but the student [[Peter Kloeden]] went on to become a full professor of mathematics in Australia then Germany.

In 1970, [[Mike Barr]] gave an abstract definition of [[topological space]] based on a notion of [[convergence]] between [[ultrafilters]] (building on work by [[Erny Manes]] on [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]).   Succinctly, Barr defined topological spaces as 'relational $\beta$-modules'.  Here we unpack this definition and examine its properties.

The correctness of this definition (in the sense of matching [[Bourbaki]]\'s definition) is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]] ($UP$).  However, the definition can be treated on its own, even in a context without $UP$.  So we also consider the properties of relational $\beta$-modules when these might not match Bourbaki spaces.


## Definitions

### Abstract

...


### Concrete

A __relational $\beta$-module__ is a [[set]] $S$ and a [[binary relation]] $\to$ between [[ultrafilters]] on $S$ and [[elements]] of $S$ that satisfies a certain rule.

To explain this rule, we first define a [[subset]] $A$ of $S$ to be __[[open subset|open]]__ if $A \in \mathcal{U}$ whenever $\mathcal{U} \to x \in A$.  Then the requirement on $\to$ is a converse:

*  $\mathcal{U} \to x$ if $A \in \mathcal{U}$ whenever $A$ is open and $x \in A$.

...


## Properties

We say that $\mathcal{U}$ __converges__ to $x$ if $\mathcal{U} \to x$.

As above, a [[subset]] $A$ of $S$ is __[[open subset|open]]__ if $A \in \mathcal{U}$ whenever $\mathcal{U} \to x \in A$.  On the other hand, $A$ is __[[closed subset|closed]]__ if $x \in A$ whenever $A \in \mathcal{U} \to x$.

A relational $\beta$-module is __[[compact space|compact]]__ if every ultrafilter converges to at least one point.  It is __[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]__ if every ultrafilter converges to at most one point.  Thus, a __[[compactum]]__ is precisely a relational $\beta$-module in which every ultrafilter converges to exactly one point.
