## Idea

>One of my early Honours students at [[Macquarie University]] baffled his proposed Queensland graduate studies supervisor who asked whether the student knew the definition of a [[topological space]]. The aspiring researcher on [[dynamical system]]s answered positively: "Yes, it is a relational $\beta$-module!"  I received quite a bit of flak from colleagues concerning that one; but the student [[Peter Kloeden]] went on to become a full professor of mathematics in Australia then Germany.

In 1970, [[Mike Barr]] gave an abstract definition of [[topological space]] based on a notion of [[convergence]] between [[ultrafilters]] (building on work by [[Erny Manes]] on [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]).   Succinctly, Barr defined topological spaces as 'relational $\beta$-modules'.  Here we unpack this definition and examine its properties.

The correctness of this definition (in the sense of matching [[Bourbaki]]\'s definition) is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]] ($UP$).  However, the definition can be treated on its own, even in a context without $UP$.  So we also consider the properties of relational $\beta$-modules when these might not match Bourbaki spaces.
