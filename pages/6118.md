## Idea

>One of my early Honours students at [[Macquarie University]] baffled his proposed Queensland graduate studies supervisor who asked whether the student knew the definition of a [[topological space]]. The aspiring researcher on [[dynamical system]]s answered positively: "Yes, it is a relational $\beta$-module!"  I received quite a bit of flak from colleagues concerning that one; but the student [[Peter Kloeden]] went on to become a full professor of mathematics in Australia then Germany.
---[[Ross Street]], in _[[An Australian conspectus of higher categories]]_

In [1970](#Barr), [[Michael Barr]] gave an abstract definition of [[topological space]] based on a notion of [[convergence]] between [[ultrafilters]] (building on work by [[Ernest Manes]] on [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]).  Succinctly, Barr defined topological spaces as 'relational $\beta$-modules'.  It was subsequently realized that this was a special case of the notion of [[generalized multicategory]].  Here we unpack this definition and examine its properties.

The correctness of this definition (in the sense of matching [[Bourbaki]]\'s definition) is equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]] ($UP$).  However, the definition can be treated on its own, even in a context without $UP$.  So we also consider the properties of relational $\beta$-modules when these might not match [[topological space|Bourbaki spaces]]. 


## Definitions

### Abstract description 

If $S$ is a [[set]], let $\beta{S}$ be the set of [[ultrafilters]] on $S$. This set is canonically identified with the set of Boolean algebra homomorphisms 

$$P(S) \to \mathbf{2},$$ 

from the power set of $S$ to $\mathbf{2}$, the unique Boolean algebra with two elements. The 2-element set carries a [[dualizing object]] structure that induces an evident [[adjoint pair]] 

$$(Set \stackrel{P}{\to} Bool^{op}) \; \dashv \;  (Bool^{op} \stackrel{\hom(-, \mathbf{2})}{\to} Set)$$ 

so that the composite [[functor]] $\beta = \hom(P-, \mathbf{2}): Set \to Set$ carries a [[monad]] structure. 

The functor $\beta : Set \to Set$ extends to [[Rel]] as follows: given a [[binary relation]] $r\colon X \to Y$, written as a subobject in $Set$

$$R \stackrel{\langle \pi_1, \pi_2 \rangle}{\to} X \times Y,$$ 

we define $\beta(r): \beta(X) \to \beta(Y)$ to be the relation obtained by taking the image of $\langle \beta(\pi_1), \beta(\pi_2) \rangle: \beta(R) \to \beta(X) \times \beta(Y)$. It turns out, although it is by no means obvious, that $\beta$ is according to this definition a _strict_ functor on $Rel$. 

The monad structure on $\beta: Set \to Set$, given by a unit $u: 1 \to \beta$ and multiplication $m: \beta \beta \to \beta$, extends not to a strict monad on $Rel$, but rather one where the transformations $u, m$ are [[lax natural transformation|op-lax]] in the sense of there being inequalities 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{u_X}{\to} & \beta X & & & & & & \beta \beta X & \stackrel{m_X}{\to} & \beta X \\  
\mathllap{r} \downarrow & \leq & \downarrow \mathrlap{\beta(r)} & & & & & & \mathllap{\beta \beta (r)} \downarrow & \leq & \downarrow \mathrlap{\beta(r)} \\
Y & \underset{u_Y}{\to} & \beta Y & & & & & & \beta \beta Y & \underset{m_Y}{\to} & \beta Y
}$$ 

(while of course the monad associativity and unit conditions remain as equations: hold on the nose). 

Then a __relational $\beta$-module__ is a [[lax algebra]] (module) of $\beta$ on the [[2-poset]] $Rel$. In other words, a set $S$ equipped with a relation $\xi: \beta S \to S$ such that the following inequalities hold: 

$$\label{rel1} \array{
S & \stackrel{u_S}{\to} & \beta S & & & & & & \beta \beta S & \stackrel{m_S}{\to} & \beta S \\
 & \mathllap{1_S} \searrow \; \leq & \downarrow \mathrlap{\xi} & & & & & & \mathllap{\beta(\xi)} \downarrow & \leq & \downarrow \mathrlap{\xi} \\ 
 & & S & & & & & & \beta S & \underset{\xi}{\to} & S
}$$ 

Arguably, it is better to consider $Rel$ as a [[proarrow equipment]] in this construction, in order to accommodate [[continuous functions]] between topological spaces (not continuous relations!) as the appropriate abstract notion of morphism between relational $\beta$-modules.  See [[generalized multicategory]] for a more generalized context. 


### Bridge to a concrete description 

A __relational $\beta$-module__ is a [[set]] $S$ and a [[binary relation]] $\xi: \beta S \to S$ between [[ultrafilters]] on $S$ and [[elements]] of $S$ that satisfy the conditions (eq:rel1) . For $F \in \beta S$ and $x \in S$, we write $F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$ if $(F, x)$ satisfies the relation $\xi$, or often just $F \rightsquigarrow x$ if the relation is clear. We pronounce this by saying "the ultrafilter $F$ _converges_ to the point $x$", so that $\xi$ plays the role of "notion of convergence". 

Preliminary to explaining the conditions (eq:rel1), we first set up a [[Galois connection]] between $\xi \in Rel(\beta S, S)$ and subsets $\mathcal{C} \in P P(S)$, so that fixed points on the $P P(S)$ side are exactly topologies on $S$, and fixed points on the other side are (as we show below) lax $\beta$-module structures on $S$. The Galois connection would then of course restrict to a Galois correspondence between topologies and lax module structures. 

Recall that each topology $\mathcal{O} \subseteq P(S)$ induces a notion of convergence where $F \rightsquigarrow x$ means $N_x \subseteq F$ ($F$ contains the filter of neighborhoods of $x$). Accordingly, for general $\mathcal{C} \subseteq P(S)$, define the relation $conv(\mathcal{C}) = \xi: \beta S \to S$ by 

$$F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x \;\;\; \Leftrightarrow \;\;\; (\forall_{U \in P(S)})\; U \in \mathcal{C} \; \wedge \; x \in U \; \Rightarrow \; U \in F.$$ 

Conversely, a topology $\mathcal{O}$ can be retrieved from its notion of convergence: under the ultrafilter principle, the neighborhood filter of a point $x$ is just the intersection of all ultrafilters containing it (hence all $F$ such that $F \rightsquigarrow x$), and then a set is open if it is a neighborhood of all of its elements. Accordingly, for general "notions of convergence" $\xi \in Rel(\beta S, S)$, we define a collection $\tau(\xi) \subseteq P(S)$ by 

$$\tau(\xi) \coloneqq \{U \subseteq S: \; (\forall_{F: \beta S, x: S})\; (x \in U \; \wedge\; F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x) \Rightarrow U \in F\}.$$ 

+-- {: .num_prop #topology} 
###### Proposition 
$\tau(\xi)$ is a topology on $S$, for any $\xi \in Rel(\beta S, S)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
It is trivial that $S \in \tau(\xi)$. If $U, V \in \tau(\xi)$, and if $x \in U \cap V$ and $F \rightsquigarrow x$, then also $x \in U$ and $x \in V$ and we conclude $U, V \in F$, whence $U \cap V \in F$ since $F$ is an ultrafilter, so that $U \cap V$ satisfies the condition of belonging to $\tau(\xi)$. Given a collection of elements $U_i \in \tau(\xi)$, if $x \in \cup_i U_i$ and $F \rightsquigarrow x$, then $x \in U_i$ for some $i$ and we conclude $U_i \in F$, whence $\cup_i U_i \in F$ since $F$ is upward closed. Therefore $\cup_i U_i$ satisfies the condition of belonging to $\tau(\xi)$ (vacuously so if the collection is empty). 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #galois} 
###### Proposition 
There is a Galois connection between notions of convergence on $S$ and subsets of $P(S)$, according to the bi-implication 

$$\mathcal{C} \subseteq \tau(\xi) \; \Leftrightarrow \; \xi \subseteq conv(\mathcal{C}).$$ 

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
To establish the bi-implication, it suffices to observe that both containments $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \tau(\xi)$ and $\xi \subseteq conv(\mathcal{C})$ are equivalent to the condition 

$$\forall_{F: \beta S} \forall_{U: P S} \forall_{x: S} (F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x) \; \wedge \; (U \in \mathcal{C}) \; \wedge \; (x \in U) \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; (U \in F).$$ 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #fix} 
###### Proposition 
If $\mathcal{O}$ is a topology on $S$, then $\mathcal{O} = \tau(conv(\mathcal{O}))$ (i.e., topologies are fixed points of the closure operator $\tau \circ \conv$). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We already have $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \tau(conv(\mathcal{O}))$ from Proposition \ref{galois}. For the other direction, we must show that any $V$ belonging to $\tau(conv(\mathcal{O}))$ is an $\mathcal{O}$-neighborhood of each of its points. Suppose the contrary: that $x \in V$ but $V$ is not an $\mathcal{O}$-neighborhood of $x$. Then for every $\mathcal{O}$-neighborhood $U \in N_x$, we have $U \cap \neg V \neq \emptyset$, so that sets of this form generate a filter. By the ultrafilter principle, we may extend this filter to an ultrafilter $F$; clearly we have $F \rightsquigarrow x$ and $\neg V \in F$, but since $F \rightsquigarrow x$ and $V \in \tau(conv(\mathcal{O}))$ and $x \in V$, we also have $V \in F$, which is inconsistent with $\neg V \in F$. 
=-- 

Propositions \ref{topology}, \ref{galois}, and \ref{fix} more or less show that a topological space $(S, \mathcal{O})$ is a particular type of [[pseudotopological space]]: 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
A pseudotopological space is set $S$ equipped with a relation $\xi: \beta S \to S$ such that $1_S \leq \xi \circ u_S$. 
=--  

All that remains is to check is: 

+-- {: .num_prop #pseudo} 
###### Proposition 
The lax unit condition $1_S \leq \xi \circ u_S$ holds if $\xi = conv(\mathcal{O})$, for a topology $\mathcal{O}$. 
=-- 

The unit $u_S: S \to \beta S$ may also be denoted $prin_S$, as it takes an element $x \in S$ to the principal ultrafilter 

$$prin_S(x) = \{U \subseteq S: x \in U\}$$ 

and now the unit condition says $prin_S(x) \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$ for all $x$. For $\xi = conv(\mathcal{O})$, this says $N_x \subseteq prin_S(x)$, or that $x \in V$ for all neighborhoods $V \in N_x$, which is a tautology. 

One of our goals is to prove the following theorem: 

+-- {: .num_theorem #conc} 
###### Theorem 
**(Main Theorem)** 
An arrow $\xi: \beta(S) \to S$ in $Rel$ is of the form $conv(\tau(\xi))$ if and only if the following inequalities are satisfied: 

$$1_S \leq \xi \circ prin_S, \qquad \xi \circ \beta(\xi) \leq \xi \circ m_S$$ 

where $m_S: \beta \beta(S) \to \beta(S)$ is the multiplication on the ultrafilter monad. 
=--

## Ultrafilter functor on $Rel$ {#functor} 

We now pause to examine more closely the extension of the ultrafilter functor $\beta: Set \to Set$ to $Rel$, showing in particular that the extension is a strict functor. First we slightly rephrase our earlier definition: 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
For a relation $r: X \to Y$ between sets, given by a subobject $R \hookrightarrow X \times Y$ in $Set$ with projections $f: R \to X$ and $g: R \to Y$, define $\bar{\beta}(r)$ to be the composite 

$$\beta(X) \stackrel{\beta(f)^{o}}{\to} \beta(R) \stackrel{\beta(g)}{\to} \beta(Y)$$ 

in the bicategory of relations. 
=-- 

Any span of functions $(h: S \to X, k: S \to Y)$ that represents $r$ (in the sense that $r = k h^{o}$ in the bicategory of relations) would serve in place of $(f, g)$, since for any such span there is an epi $s: S \to R$ with $h = f s$, $k = g s$, whence $\beta(s)$ is epi (because the epi $s$ splits in $Set$) and we have 

$$\array{
\beta(g)\beta(f)^{o} & = & \beta(g)\beta(s)\beta(s)^{o}\beta(f)^{o} \\
 & = & \beta(g)\beta(s)(\beta(f)\beta(s))^{o} \\ 
 & = & \beta(g s)\beta(f s)^{o} \\ 
 & = & \beta(k)\beta(h)^{o}.
}$$ 

In particular, $\bar{\beta}$ is well-defined. Since $\bar{\beta}$ extends $\beta: Set \to Set$, there is no harm in writing $\beta(r)$ in place of $\bar{\beta}(r)$. If $r \leq r': X \to Y$, then $\beta(r) \leq \beta(r')$ (as can be seen from the calculation displayed above, but replacing the epi $s$ by a general map $t$, and the first equation by an inequality $\geq$). 

+-- {: .num_remark #oplax}
###### Remark 
The same recipe works to extend any functor $T: Set \to Set$ to $Rel$, and the extension $\bar{T}: Rel \to Rel$ is always an _op-lax_ functor in the sense that 

$$\bar{T}(r s) \leq \bar{T}(r) \bar{T}(s)$$ 

as is easily seen by contemplating a pullback diagram (where $r = g f^{o}$ and $s = k h^{o}$): 

$$\array{
 & & & & Q & & & & \\ 
 & & & \mathllap{p} \swarrow & & \searrow \mathrlap{q} & & & \\
 & & R & & & & S & & \\
 & \mathllap{f} \swarrow & & \searrow \mathrlap{g} & & \mathllap{h} \swarrow & & \searrow \mathrlap{k} & \\ 
X & & & & Y & & & & Z
}$$ 

whereupon one calculates 

$$\array{
\bar{T}(r s) & = & T(k q) T(f p)^{o} \\ 
 & = & T(k) T(q) T(p)^{o} T(f)^{o} \\ 
 & \leq & T(k) T(h)^{o} T(g) T(f)^{o} \\ 
 & = & \bar{T}(r) \bar{T}(s) 
}$$ 

where the inequality comes from $T(q) T(p)^{o} \leq T(h)^{o} T(g)$, which is equivalent to $T(h) T(q) \leq T(g) T(p)$ (where even equality holds). This calculation shows that $\bar{T}$ is an actual (not just an op-lax) functor on $Rel$ iff $T$ satisfies the **Beck-Chevalley** condition: if $(p, q)$ is a pullback of $(g, h)$, then 

$$T(q) T(p)^{o} = T(h)^{o} T(g).$$ 

This in turn amounts to $T$ preserving weak pullbacks. (It actually says $T$ takes pullbacks to weak pullbacks, but this implies $T$ takes weak pullbacks to weak pullbacks because any endofunctor $T$ on $Set$ preserves epis, using the axiom of choice.) 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #BC} 
###### Proposition 
The functor $\beta: Set \to Set$ satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition (and therefore the extension $\beta: Rel \to Rel$ is a strict functor). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Referring to the pullback diagram in Remark \ref{oplax}, let $Q = R \times_Y S$ be the pullback. We must show that the canonical map 

$$\beta(R \times_Y S) \to \beta(R) \times_{\beta(Y)} \beta(S)$$ 

is epic. Viewing this as a continuous map between compact Hausdorff spaces (see [this section](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/compactum#ultrafilters_form_a_compactum_23) of the article on [[compacta]]), it suffices to show that the canonical map 

$$R \times_Y S \to \beta(R) \times_{\beta(Y)} \beta(S)$$ 

has a dense image. Let $(G, H) \in \beta(R) \times_{\beta(Y)} \beta(S)$, so that $\beta(g)(G) = \beta(h)(H)$ are the same ultrafilter $J \in \beta(Y)$. Let $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ be [basic open neighborhoods](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/compactum#the_space_of_ultrafilters_19) of $G$ and $H$ in $\beta(R)$ and $\beta(S)$ respectively; we must show that there is $(r, s) \in R \times_Y S$ such that 

$$(prin(r), prin(s)) \in \hat{A} \times \hat{B}$$ 

or in other words such that $r \in A$ and $s \in B$. We have $g^{-1}(g(A)) \in G$ since $A \in G$ and $A \subseteq g^{-1}(g(A))$, so that $g(A)$ belongs to 

$$J = \beta(g)(G) \coloneqq \{C \subseteq Y: g^{-1}(C) \in G\}$$ 

and similarly $h(B) \in J$. It follows that $g(A) \cap h(B) \in J$ so that $g(A) \cap h(B) \neq \emptyset$. Any element $y \in g(A) \cap h(B)$ can be written as $y = g(r)$ and $y = h(s)$ for some $r \in A$ and $s \in B$, and this completes the proof. 
=-- 

### The 2-poset of $\beta$-relations 

Proposition \ref{BC} is instrumental in developing a context in which relational $\beta$-modules may be seen in terms of (relational) [[generalized multicategories]]. 

In the ordinary theory of generalized multicategories, one starts with a [[cartesian monad]] $T$ on a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, and proceeds to construct a [[bicategory]] of $T$-spans. These are spans of the form 

$$T X \stackrel{p_1}{\leftarrow} R \stackrel{p_2} Y$$ 

to be continued... 

## Proof of Main Theorem 

We now return to the task of proving theorem \ref{conc}. 

+-- {: .num_remark #open} 
###### Remark 
For a topological space $(S, \mathcal{O})$ and a point $x \in S$, let $\xi = conv(\mathcal{O})$, and let $\mathcal{O}_x$ be the collection of _open_ neighborhoods of $x$. Then $F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$, i.e., $N_x \subseteq F$, is equivalent to $\mathcal{O}_x \subseteq F$. This is because $N_x$ is the filter generated by $\mathcal{O}_x$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
The following conditions are equivalent: 

* $\xi = conv(\mathcal{C})$ for some $\mathcal{C} \subseteq P(S)$; 

* $\xi = conv(\mathcal{O})$ for some topology $\mathcal{O} \subseteq P(S)$; 

* $\xi = conv(\tau(\xi))$. 

Indeed, $conv \circ \tau \circ conv = conv$ by general properties of Galois connections. Applying $conv \circ \tau$ to both sides of the first equation, we have 

$$conv(\tau(\xi)) = (conv \circ \tau \circ conv)(\mathcal{C}) =  conv(\mathcal{C}) = \xi$$ 

so the first equation implies the third. Which in turn implies the second, since we know by proposition \ref{topology} that collections $\mathcal{O}$ of the form $\tau(\xi)$ are topologies. The second equation trivially implies the first. 
=-- 

We now break up our Main Theorem \ref{conc} into the following two theorems. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
If $\xi = conv(\mathcal{O})$ for a topology $\mathcal{O}$, then the two inequalities of (eq:rel1) are satisfied. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The first inequality (lax unit condition) was already verified in proposition \ref{pseudo}. For the second (lax associativity), let us represent the relation $\xi$ by a span $\beta S \stackrel{\pi_1}{\leftarrow} R \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} S$, so that $\beta(\xi) = \beta(\pi_2) \beta(\pi_1)^o$. The lax associativity condition becomes 

$$\pi_2 \pi_1^o \beta(\pi_2) \beta(\pi_1)^o \leq \pi_2 \pi_1^o m_S$$ 

which (using $\beta(\pi_1) \dashv \beta(\pi_1)^o$) is equivalent to 

$$\label{assoc} \pi_2 \pi_1^o \beta(\pi_2) \leq \pi_2 \pi_1^o m_S \beta(\pi_1)$$ 

or in other words that for all $\mathcal{G}: \beta(R)$, $x: S$ 

$$\label{conv1} \beta(\pi_2)(\mathcal{G}) \rightsquigarrow_\xi x \;\; \vdash \;\; m_S \beta(\pi_1)(\mathcal{G}) \rightsquigarrow_\xi x.$$ 

Here $\beta(\pi_2)(\mathcal{G})$ is, by definition, 

$$\{U \subseteq S: \pi_2^{-1}(U) \in \mathcal{G}\},$$ 

with $\beta(\pi_1)(\mathcal{G})$ defined similarly. The monad multiplication $m_S: \beta \beta S \to \beta S$ is by definition 

$$(\mathcal{U}: \beta\beta S) \;\; m_S(\mathcal{U}) \coloneqq \{A \subseteq S: \hat{A} \in \mathcal{U}\}$$ 

where $\hat{A} = \{F \in \beta S: A \in F\}$ (see also the [previous section](nlab/show/relational+beta-module#functor)). 

Thus, (eq:conv1) translates into the following entailment (using remark \ref{open}):  

$$\array{
 & & \mathcal{O}_x \subseteq \{A \subseteq S: \pi_2^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{G}\} \\ 
 & \vdash & \forall_{U: P S} U \in \mathcal{O}_x \Rightarrow \pi_1^{-1}(\hat{U}) \in \mathcal{G}.
}$$ 

This would naturally follow if 

$$\forall_{U \in \mathcal{O}_x} \pi_2^{-1}(U) \subseteq \pi_1^{-1}(\hat{U}).$$ 

But a pair $(F, y)$ belongs to $\pi_2^{-1}(U)$ if $F \rightsquigarrow_\xi y$ and $y \in U$; we want to show this implies $F = \pi_1(F, y)$ belongs to $\hat{U}$, or in other words that $U \in F$. But this is tautological, given how $conv(\mathcal{O})$ is defined in terms of a topology $\mathcal{O}$. 
=-- 

The next theorem establishes the converse of the preceding theorem; the two theorems together establish the Main Theorem. First we need a lemma. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #closed} 
###### Lemma 
Given any relation $\xi: Rel(\beta S, S)$ and $x: S$, $A \subseteq S$, we have that $x$ belongs to the closure $\bar{A}$ wrt the topology $\tau(\xi)$ if and only if $\exists_{F: \beta S} A \in F \; \wedge \; F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
As usual, let $\neg A$ denote the complement of a subset $A$. By definition of the topology $\tau(\xi)$, we have that $\neg A$ is a neighborhood of $x$ if $\forall_{F: \beta S} F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x \; \Rightarrow \; \neg A \in F$. In other words, 

$$\array{
x \in int(\neg A) & \Leftrightarrow & \forall_{F: \beta S} \; F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x \; \Rightarrow \; \neg A \in F \\
 & \Leftrightarrow & \forall_{F: \beta S} \; \neg ((A \in F) \; \wedge \; (F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x))
}$$ 

since in an ultrafilter $F$, we have $\neg (A \in F)$ iff $(\neg A) \in F$. Negating both sides of this bi-implication gives 

$$\array{ 
x \in \bar{A} & \Leftrightarrow & \exists_{F: \beta S} \; A \in F \; \wedge \; F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x
}$$ 

as desired. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
If $\xi: \beta S \to S$ in $Rel$ satisfies the inequalities of (eq:rel1), then $\xi = conv(\tau(\xi))$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We have $\xi \leq conv(\tau(\xi))$ from the Galois connection (proposition \ref{galois}), so we just need to prove $conv(\tau(\xi)) \subseteq \xi$, or that $F \rightsquigarrow_{conv(\tau(\xi))} x$ (henceforth abbreviated as $F \rightsquigarrow_{\tau(\xi)} x$) implies $F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$ under the conditions (eq:rel1). 

If $F \rightsquigarrow_{\tau(\xi)} x$, then every neighborhood $V$ of $x$ belongs to $F$, so that for every $U \in F$, every neighborhood $V$ of $x$ intersects $U$ in a nonempty set. But this just means $x \in \bar{U}$ for every $U \in F$, or in other words (using lemma \ref{closed}) that 

$$U \in F \; \; \vdash \; \; \exists_{G: \beta S} U \in G \; \wedge \; G \rightsquigarrow_\xi x.$$ 

Representing the relation $\xi$ as usual by a subset $\langle \pi_1, \pi_2 \rangle: R \hookrightarrow \beta S \times S$, another way of expressing the existential formula on the right of this entailment is: 

$$\exists_{(G, x): R} G \in \hat{U}$$ or 

$$\exists_{\gamma: R} \pi_1(\gamma) \in \hat{U} \wedge \pi_2(\gamma) = x$$ 

or even just 

$$\label{ult} \pi_1^{-1}(\hat{U}) \wedge \pi_2^{-1}(\{x\}) \neq \emptyset$$ 

as subsets of $R$, as $U$ ranges over all elements of $F$. We therefore have that subsets of the form (eq:ult) generate a proper filter of $R$. By the ultrafilter principle, we may extend this filter to an ultrafilter $\mathcal{G} \in \beta R$. 

By construction, we have 

$$F \subseteq \{B \subseteq X: \pi_1^{-1}(\hat{B})) \in \mathcal{G}\} \qquad prin_S(x) \subseteq \{A \subseteq X: \pi_2^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{G}\}$$ 

but in fact these inclusions are equalities since the left sides and right sides are ultrafilters. Put differently, we have established 

$$F = (m_S \circ \beta(\pi_1))(\mathcal{G}), \qquad prin_S(x) = \beta(\pi_2)(\mathcal{G}).$$ 

Notice that the lax unit condition of (eq:rel1) implies that $prin_S(x) = \beta(\pi_2)(\mathcal{G}) \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$, or that $(\mathcal{G}, x)$ belongs to the relation $\xi \circ \beta(\pi_2)$. Recall also that the lax associativity condition is equivalent to (eq:assoc), which says 

$$\xi \circ \beta(\pi_2) \leq \xi \circ m_S \circ \beta(\pi_1);$$ 

in other words $(\mathcal{G}, x)$ belongs to $\xi \circ m_S \circ \beta(\pi_1)$, i.e., $F = (m_S \circ \beta(\pi_1))(\mathcal{G}) \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$, as was to be shown. 
=-- 

This completes the proof of the Main Theorem (theorem \ref{conc}).

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose first that $f$ is continuous, and that $(F, y) \in \beta(X) \times Y$ belongs to $f \circ \xi$, i.e., there is $x$ such that $F \rightsquigarrow x$ and $f(x) = y$. We want to show $\beta(f)(F) \rightsquigarrow y = f(x)$, or that any open set $V$ containing $f(x)$ belongs to $\beta(f)(F)$. The latter means $f^{-1}(V) \in F$, which is true since $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set containing $x$ and $F \rightsquigarrow x$. 

Now suppose $f \circ \xi \leq \theta \circ \beta(f)$. To show $f$ is continuous, it suffices to show that 

$$f(\bar{A}) \subseteq \widebar{f(A)}$$ 

for any $A \subseteq X$ (easy exercise). For $x \in \bar{A}$, lemma \ref{closed} shows there is $F: \beta(X)$ with $A \in F$ and $F \rightsquigarrow x$. Under the supposition we have $\beta(f)(F) \rightsquigarrow f(x)$, and we also have $f(A) \in \beta(f)(F)$, because $A \subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$ and $F$ is upward closed and $A \in F$ implies $f^{-1}(f(A)) \in F$. Then again by lemma \ref{closed}, $f(A) \in \beta(f)(F)$ and $\beta(f)(F) \rightsquigarrow f(x)$ implies $f(x) \in \widebar{f(A)}$, as desired.

## Properties 

As above, a [[subset]] $A$ of $S$ is __[[open subset|open]]__ if $A \in \mathcal{U}$ whenever $\mathcal{U} \to x \in A$.  On the other hand, by lemma \ref{closed}, $A$ is __[[closed subset|closed]]__ if $x \in A$ whenever $A \in \mathcal{U} \to x$.

A relational $\beta$-module is __[[compact space|compact]]__ if every ultrafilter converges to at least one point.  It is __[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]__ if every ultrafilter converges to at most one point.  Thus, a __[[compactum]]__ is (assuming $UF$) precisely a relational $\beta$-module in which every ultrafilter converges to exactly one point, that is in which the action of the monad $\beta$ lives in $Set$ rather than in $Rel$. Full proofs may be found at [[compactum]]; see also [[ultrafilter monad]]. 

A continuous map $f$ from $(X, \xi: \beta X \to X)$ to $(Y, \theta: \beta Y \to Y)$ is [[proper map|proper]] if the square 

$$\array{
\beta X & \stackrel{\xi}{\to} & X \\
\mathllap{\beta (f)} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{f} \\
\beta Y & \underset{\theta}{\to} & Y
}$$ 

commutes (strictly) in $Rel$, and $f$ is [[open map|open]] if the square 

$$\array{
\beta X & \stackrel{\xi}{\to} & X \\
\mathllap{\beta (f)^o} \uparrow & & \uparrow \mathrlap{f^o} \\
\beta Y & \underset{\theta}{\to} & Y
}$$ 

commutes in $Rel$. From this point of view, a space $X$ is Hausdorff if the diagonal map $\delta: X \to X \times X$ is proper, and compact if $\epsilon: X \to 1$ is proper (and these facts remain true even for pseudotopological spaces). See [Clementino, Hofmann, and Janelidze](#CHJ), _infra_ corollary 2.5. 

The following _ultrafilter interpolation_ result is due to [Pisani](#Pis):

###### Theorem 
A topological space $(X, \xi)$ is exponentiable if, whenever $m_X(\mathcal{U}) \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$ for $\mathcal{U} \in \beta\beta X$ and $x \in X$, there exists $F \in \beta X$ with $\mathcal{U} \rightsquigarrow_{\beta(\xi)} F$ and $F \rightsquigarrow_\xi x$.

For an convergence-approach extension of this result to exponentiable _maps_ in $Top$, see [Clementino, Hofmann, and Tholen](#CHT).

###### Definition 
A continuous map $f: X \to Y$ is a _discrete fibration_ if, whenever $G \rightsquigarrow y$ in $Y$ and $f(x) = y$, there exists a unique $F \in \beta(X)$ such that $\beta(f)(F) = G$ and $F \rightsquigarrow x$ in $X$.

###### Proposition 
A continuous map $f: X \to Y$ is &eacute;tale (a local homeomorphism) if $f$ and $\delta_f: X \to X \times_Y X$ are both discrete fibrations.

## Relation to nonstandard analysis

In [[nonstandard analysis]] (which implicitly relies throughout on $UF$), one may define a topological space using a relation between hyperpoints (elements of $S^*$) and standard points (elements of $S$).  If $u$ is a hyperpoint and $x$ is a standard point, then we write $u \approx x$ and say that $x$ is a __[[standard part]]__ of $u$ or that $u$ belongs to the __[[halo]]__ (or _monad_, but *not* the category-theoretic kind) of $x$.  This relation must satisfy a condition analogous to the condition in the definition of a relational $\beta$-module.  The nonstandard defintions of open set, compact space, etc are also analogous.  (Accordingly, one can speak of *the* standard part of $u$ only for Hausdorff spaces.)

So ultrafilters behave very much like hyperpoints.  This is not to say that ultrafilters *are* (or even can be) hyperpoints, as they don\'t obey the [[transfer principle]].  Nevertheless, one does use ultrafilters to construct the [[model]]s of nonstandard analysis in which hyperpoints actually live.  Intuitions developed for nonstandard analysis can profitably be applied to ultrafilters, but the transfer principle is not valid in proofs.


## Relation to other topological concepts

If $\beta$ is treated as a monad on $Set$ instead of on $Rel$, then its algebras are the [[compacta]] (the compact Hausdorff spaces), again assuming $UP$; see [[ultrafilter monad]], and more especially [[compactum]]. 

One might hope that there would be an analogous treatment of [[uniform spaces]] based on an [[equivalence relation]] between ultrafilters.  (In nonstandard analysis, this becomes a relation $\approx$ of infinite closeness between arbitrary hyperpoints, instead of only a relation between hyperpoints and standard points.)  The description in terms of generalized multicategories is known to generalize to a description of uniform spaces, but rather than using relations between ultrafilters, this description uses pro-relations between points. 

Indeed, an abstract niche which accommodates and unifies Barr's approach to topological spaces, Lawvere's approach to [[metric spaces]], as well as uniform structures, [[prometric spaces]], and [[approach structures]], has been given by [Clementino, Hofmann, and Tholen](#CHT2).
