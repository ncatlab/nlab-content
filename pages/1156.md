An **($\infty$,1)-sheaf** is another term for an [[∞-stack]] with values in [[∞-groupoid]]s. 

See [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] for more.

#Remarks#

The practice of writing “$\infty$-sheaf” instead of [[∞-stack]] is a rather reasonable one, since a [[stack]] is nothing but a _2-sheaf_. This is the practice adopted for instance in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]

But there “$\infty$” really means $(\infty,1)$.
