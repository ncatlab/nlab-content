The book

* [[Paul Taylor]],  _Practical Foundations of Mathematics_ ([web](http://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/prafm/index.html))

is a description of how (in Taylor\'s opinion) the [[foundations]] of mathematics should really be done, with an eye towards matching how mathematics is done in practice (with the consequence that the system is no stronger than necessary).

The result is actually a series of foundations, most [[constructive mathematics|constructive]], suitable for different sorts of mathematics.  Ultimately, these are described as [[internal logic|logic in]] categories defined by [[sketch]]es and equipped with distinguished [[pullback]]-stable classes of _display morphisms_.

It is [available online](http://www.PaulTaylor.EU/Practical-Foundations/index.html) in a somewhat unreadable format.

A useful survey of some of the topics discussed there is also in

* [[Paul Taylor]], _Foundations for computable topology_ ([web](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/foufct/abstract.html))
