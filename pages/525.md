## Idea

A _bialgebra_ (or bi[[gebra]]) is both an [[algebra]] and a [[coalgebra]], where the operations of either one are [[homomorphisms]] for the other. A bialgebra structure on an [[associative algebra]] is precisely such as to make its [[category of modules]] into a [[monoidal category]] equipped with a [[fiber functor]].


A bialgebra is one of the ingredients in the concept of [[Hopf algebra]].


## Definition

A **bialgebra** is a [[monoid]] [[internalization|in]] the category of [[coalgebra|coalgebras]].  Equivalently, it is a [[comonoid]] [[internalization|in]] the category of [[algebra|algebras]].  Equivalently, it is a monoid in the category of comonoids in [[Vect]] --- or equivalently, a comonoid in the category of monoids in [[Vect]].

More generally, a **[[bimonoid]]** in a monoidal category $M$ is a monoid in the category of comonoids in $M$ --- or equivalently, a comonoid in the category of monoids in $M$.  So, a bialgebra is a bimonoid in $Vect$.

## Properties

### Relation to sesquialgebras

Bialgebras are precisely those [[sesquialgebras]] $A$ whose product $A \otimes A$-$A$-[[bimodule]] is induced from an algebra [[homomorphism]] $A \to A \otimes A$ and whose unit $k$-$A$ bimodule is induced from an algebra homomorphism $A \to k$.

### Tannaka duality and categories of modules

The structure of a bialgebra on an [[associative algebra]] equips its [[category of modules]] with the structure of a [[monoidal category]] and a monoidal [[fiber functor]]. In fact that construction is an equivalence. This is the statement of [[Tannaka duality]] for bialgebras. For instance ([Bakke](#Bakke))

## Examples

Notions of bialgebra with further structure notably include _[[Hopf algebras]]_ and their variants.
