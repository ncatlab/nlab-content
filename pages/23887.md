## Idea


The notion of a *lattice object* is the generalization of that of *[[lattice]]* as one passes from the ambient [[category of sets]] [[internalization|into]] more general ambient  [[categories]] with suitable properties.


## Definition

In a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, a **lattice object** is a [[bicartesian preordered object]] that is also a [[partially ordered object]].
