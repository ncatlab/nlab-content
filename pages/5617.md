## Idea

The _volume form_ on a finite-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[orientation|oriented]] (pseudo)-[[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is the [[differential form]] whose [[integral]] over pieces of $X$ computes the [[volume]] of $X$ as measured by the [[metric]] $g$.

If the manifold is unoriented, then we get a _volume [[pseudoform]]_ instead.


## Definition

For $(X,g)$ an [[orientation|oriented]] (pseudo)-[[Riemannian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$, its **volume form** $vol_g \in \Omega^n(X)$ is the [[differential form]] of degree $n$ that is defined by any of the following equivalent statements.

* The symmetric square $vol_g \cdot vol_g$ is equal to the $n$-fold [[wedge product]] $g \wedge \cdots \wedge g$, as elements of $\Omega^n(X) \otimes \Omega^n(X)$, and $vol_g$ is [[positive n-form|positive]].

* The volume form is the image under the [[Hodge star]] operator $\star_g\colon \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^{n-k}(X)$ of the [[smooth function]] $1 \in \Omega^0(X)$

  $$
    vol_g = \star_g 1
    \,.
  $$

* In local oriented coordinates, $vol_g = \sqrt{|det(g)|}$, where $det(g)$ is the [[determinant]] of the [[matrix]] of the coordinates of $g$.

* For $(E, \Omega)\colon T X \to iso(n)$ the [[Lie algebra valued differential form]] on $X$ with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] $iso(n)$ that encodes the metric and orientation (the _[[spin connection]]_ $\Omega$ with the _[[vielbein]]_ $E$), the volume form is the image of $(E,\Omega)$ under the canonical volume [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycle]] $vol \in CE(iso(n))$:

  $$
    vol_g = vol(E)
    \,.
  $$

  See [[Poincare Lie algebra]] for more on this.


## Generalisations

If $(X,g)$ is unoriented, then the definitions above don't quite make sense, but (at least) the first three can be reinterpreted to give an $n$-[[pseudoform]] instead, the __volume pseudoform__, or __volume element__.  (Whether a pseudoform is positive is independent of the orientation, the Hodge operator still takes forms to pseudoforms, and local coordinates for a pseudoform include a local orientation.)

The concept of volume (pseudo)-form can also be axiomatised: on any $n$-dimensional manifold, a __volume form__ is any $n$-form that is [[positive n-form|positive]] (meaning that its [[integral]] on any [[open submanifold]] is nonnegative) and nondegenerate (meaning that it's nowhere zero).  Altogether, we may say that its integral on any [[inhabited subset|inhabited]] open submanifold is (strictly) positive.  Such a structure is actually equivalent to an [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] positive [[Radon measure]] on $X$.

If $X$ is unoriented, then we can only integrate $n$-pseudoforms, so we can only axiomatise the concept of volume pseudoform.  On the other hand, if we equip $X$ with a nondegenerate $n$-form $vol$, then there is a unique orientation $o$ on $X$ such that $vol$ is positive and therefore (relative to $o$) a volume form.  (Nondegeneracy is vital here.)

If I remember correctly, every volume (pseudo)form comes from a metric, which is unique iff $n \leq 1$.
