[[abelian category|Abelian categories]] are a common generalization of the category of abelian groups, categories of $R$-modules where $R$ is a ring, and the categories of sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of rings on a topological space $X$. Similarly, in the categorical dimension 2, one wants to define an __abelian 2-category__ as a generalization of symmetric 2-groups and possibly some 2-related categories. There is a couple of different proposals in the literature.
