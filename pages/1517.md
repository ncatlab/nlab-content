For a [[category]] $C$ and [[endofunctor]] $F$, a **[[coalgebra]] of** $F$ is an [[object]] $X$ in $C$ and a map $\alpha: X \to F(X)$. (The object $X$ may be called the __carrier__ of the coalgebra)

Given two coalgebras $(x, \eta: x \to F x)$, $(y, \theta: y \to F y)$, a coalgebra map is a [[morphism]] $f: x \to y$ which respects the coalgebra structures: 

$$\theta \circ f = F(f) \circ \eta$$

The dual concept is an [[algebra for an endofunctor]]. Both [[algebras]] and coalgebras for endofunctors on $C$ are special cases of [[algebra for a C-C bimodule|algebras for C-C bimodules]].

See also [[terminal coalgebra]].

##Examples of coalgebras for functors on [[Set]]:

* $X \to F(X) = D(X)$, the set of probability distributions on $X$: Markov chain on $X$.
* $X \to F(X) = P(X)$, the powerset on $X$: Binary relation on $X$.
* $X \to F(X) = X^A \times B$: Deterministic automaton.
* $X \to F(X) = P(X^A \times B)$: Nondeterministic automaton.
* $X \to F(X) = A \times X \times X$, for a set of labels $A$: Labelled binary tree.
