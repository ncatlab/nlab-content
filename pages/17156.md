## Idea

In [[linear algebra]], alternating [[multilinear functions]] are well known, and are in many cases (over the [[real numbers]], for example) are equivalent to [[antisymmetric multifunction|antisymmetric functions]].  In cases where they differ (such as in [[characteristic]] $2$), it is often the alternating functions that behave better.

Actually, being alternating is not, in itself, really about linearity, and we can abstract away to a nonlinear concept of _alternating function_.  (That said, there is one bit of very mild linear structure that is needed: a [[basepoint]] in the [[target]] set.)


## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[set]], and let $(Y,0)$ be a [[pointed set]] (so $Y$ is a set and $0$ is one of its elements).  Let $n$ be a [[natural number]] (or indeed any [[cardinal number]]).  Recall that a [[multifunction]] of [[arity]] $n$ to $Y$ from $X$ is the same thing as a [[function]] to $Y$ from the $n$-fold [[cartesian power]] $X^n$.

An __alternating multifunction__ (or simply _alternating function_) of arity $n$ from $X$ to $(Y,0)$ is a multifunction of arity $n$ from $X$ to $Y$ such that, whenever two of the function\'s arguments are equal, the value of the function is $0$.  In arity $0$ or $1$, every multifunction is trivially alternating; in arity $2$, we can write this as the [[equational law]] $f(a,a) = 0$; in arity $3$, we have the equational laws $f(a,a,b) = 0$, $f(a,b,a) = 0$, and $f(a,b,b) = 0$; etc.


## Properties

If $X$ and $Y$ are [[modules]] over a [[base rig]] in which $2$ is cancellable (or indeed if multiplication by $2$ is cancellable in $Y$), and taking $0 \in Y$ to be the usual [[zero]] element of a module, then an alternating [[multilinear function]] is the same thing as an [[antisymmetric function|antisymmetric]] multilinear function.  Even if $2$ is not cancellable, any alternating multilinear function is antisymmetric, but not the reverse.  (In the case where $Y$ is the base rig, we speak of an _alternating form_.)

Note that the [[alternating groups]] are really about antisymmetric functions rather than alternating functions as such.  (Whereas a [[symmetric function]] is preserved by the application of any element of the [[symmetric group]], an antisymmetric function is preserved by and only by the elements of the alternating group.)  Nevertheless, this precise distinction between 'alternating' and 'antisymmetric' is well established in the theory of vector spaces over a field of [[characteristic]] $2$ (in which multiplication by $2$ is as uncancellable as possible).


## Constructive aspects

In [[constructive mathematics]], we usually assume that the arity $n$ of $f$ has [[decidable equality]], which is true if $n$ is a [[natural number]] (which is most common) or even a (possibly infinite) [[extended natural number]].  However, as long as the arity is equipped with an [[inequality]], then we can state the definition: whenever equal arguments have inequal indices, the value of the multifunction $f$ there is zero.  If $X$ and $Y$ are also equipped with inequalities, then $f$ is __strongly alternating__ if, whenever its value is inequal to $0$ in $Y$, then arguments with inequal indices must be inequal in $X$.  (In arity $2$, for example, if $f(a,b) \ne 0$, then $a \ne b$.)  If the inequality on $Y$ is [[tight relation|tight]] (so that its [[negation]] is [[equality]] in $Y$), then every strongly alternating function is alternating, but the reverse requires [[excluded middle]] in general.
