## Idea
 {#Idea}

### Basic idea

In the general sense, _superalgebra_ is the study of ([[higher algebra|higher]]) [[algebra]] 

* [[internalization|internal]] to the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector spaces]] ([[super vector spaces]]);

equivalently 

* over the [[base topos]] on [[superpoints]].

More specifically, an _associative superalgebra_ is an [[associative algebra]] in the context of superalgebra. As in the ordinary case, this is often just called _a superalgebra_ , too.


In the following we first discuss

* _[Associative superalgebras](#AssociativeSuperalgebras)_

as [[monoids]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector spaces]]. Then we pass to the perspective of

* _[Algebra in the topos over superpoints](#AlgebraOverSuperpoints)_

and consider systematically [[algebra]] in the [[sheaf topos]] over the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s and show how this reproduces and generalizes the previous notions.

See ([Sachse](#Sachse)) and the references at _[[super ∞-groupoid]]_ for some history of the topos-theoretic perspective on superalgebra.


### Abstract idea
 {#AbstractIdea}

Superalgebra is [[universal property|universal]] in the following sense. The crucial super-grading rule (the "Koszul sign rule") 

$$
  a \otimes b = (-1)^{deg(a) deg(b)} b \otimes a
$$

in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded vector spaces]] is induced from the [[subcategory]] which is the [[abelian 2-group]] of metric graded [[lines]]. This in turn is the [[free construction|free]] [[abelian 2-group]] (groupal [[symmetric monoidal category]]) on a single generator.  (This point of view is amplified for instance in the first part of ([Kapranov 13](#Kapranov13)), whose second part is about [[super 2-algebra]]). Generally then super-grading and hence super-algebra arises from the [[truncated object|2-truncation]] (3-[[coskeleton]]) of the free [[abelian ∞-group]] on a single generator, which is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$. So the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading of superalgebra comes from the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_n(\mathbb{S})$ in degree 1 and 2:

| $n = $ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $\cdots$ | 
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--|
| $\pi_n(\mathbb{S}) = $ | $\mathbb{Z}$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$ | $ 0 $ | $0$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_{240}$ | $\cdots$ |
| meaning: | degree | [[boson]]/[[fermion]] super-degree | [[spin geometry|spin]] | [[string geometry|string]] | $-$ | $-$ | ? | ? | $\cdots$ |
| [[free construction|free object]] on single [[generators and relations|generator]]: | [[abelian group]] | [[abelian 2-group]] | [[abelian 3-group]] | [[abelian 4-group]] |  |  | [[abelian 7-group]] | [[abelian ∞-group|abelian 8-group]] | [[abelian ∞-group]] | 



This suggests (as hinted at in ([Kapranov 13](#Kapranov13))) that in full generality [[higher geometry|higher]] [[supergeometry]] is to be thought of as $\mathbb{S}$-[[graded object|graded]] geometry, hence [[Isbell duality|dually]] as [[higher algebra]] with [[∞-group of units]] [[augmented ∞-group|augmented]] over the [[sphere spectrum]]. 

But notice that this is canonically so for every [[E-∞ ring]], see at _[∞-group of units -- Augmented definition](infinity-group+of+units#AugmentedDefinition)_. This would mean: In [[higher geometry]]/[[higher algebra]] supergeometry/superalgebra is intrinsic, canonically given. 


Using this together with [[Hisham Sati|Sati]]'s _[[Geometric and topological structures related to M-branes]]_, we can derive the terminology in the above table as indicated now. 

> The following uses a not yet published story of cohomological quantization that is briefly indicated [[schreiber:Synthetic Quantum Field Theory|here]]. More details to be spelled out here when the details have been published. Until then, take the following with the required skepticism or, if necessary, raise complaints over at the nForum. ) 

* **$d = 1$ [[sigma-model]]** 

  The [[local coefficients]] for [[quantization|quantizing]] the ([[spinning particle|spinning]]) [[particle]] on the [[boundary]] of the [[string]] ending on a [[D-brane]] (by K-theoretic [[geometric quantization by push-forward]]/[[D-brane charge]]) are

  $$
    \array{   
      B BU(1)
      &\simeq&
      B K(\mathbb{Z},2)
      &\to& 
      B gl_1(MU) 
      &\to&
      MU \text{-}Mod
    }
  $$

  for $MU$ the [[complex K-theory spectrum]] [[E-∞ ring]], and
  hence the characteristic twists are in degree 2 of the group of units, hence of the graded group of units

  $$
    gl_1^gr(MU) \to \mathbb{S}
  $$

  hence are graded by the second [[homotopy group]] 

  $$  
    \pi_2(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
  $$

  of the sphere spectrum.

* **$d = 2$ [[sigma-model]]** 

  The [[local coefficients]] for [[quantization|quantizing]] the [[string]] (on the [[boundary]] of the [[M2-brane]] ending on an [[M9-brane]]) are

  $$

      &\simeq&

      &\to& 
      B gl_1(tmf) 
      &\to&
      tmf \text{-}Mod
    }
  $$

  for the [[tmf]] [[E-∞ ring]], and
  hence the characteristic twists are in degree 3 of the group of units, hence of the graded group of units

  $$
    gl_1^gr(tmf) \to \mathbb{S}
  $$

  hence are graded by the third [[homotopy group]] 

  $$  
    \pi_3(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{24}
  $$

  of the sphere spectrum.

* **$d = 5$ [[sigma-model]]** 

  The [[local coefficients]] for [[quantization|quantizing]] the [[Yang monopole]] (on the [[boundary]] of the [[M5-brane]] ending on an [[M9-brane]]) are

  $$
    \array{

      B gl_1(K(5)) 
      &\to&
      K(5) \text{-}Mod
    }
    \,,
  $$

  and
  hence the characteristic twists are in degree 6 of the group of units, hence of the graded group of units

  $$
    gl_1^gr(K(5)) \to \mathbb{S}
  $$

  hence are graded by the sixth [[homotopy group]] 

  $$  
    \pi_6(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{2}
  $$

  of the sphere spectrum.

## Associative superalgebras
 {#AssociativeSuperalgebras}

### Definition

#### Superalgebras

An ordinary [[associative algebra]] (a [[vector space]] with a linear and associative and unital product operation) is a [[monoid]] in the [[monoidal category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]].

Throughout, fix a [[field]] $k$ of [[characteristic]] 0.

+-- {: .num_defn #SuperVectorSpaces}
###### Definition

Write [[SVect]] for the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector space]]s over $k$. This is the [[category]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space]]s equipped with the unique non-trivial symmetric [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal structure]].

Objects are vector spaces with a [[direct sum]] decomposition

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}
$$

and the [[tensor product]] is given in terms of that on vector spaces by

$$
  V \otimes W = 
  (V_{even} \otimes W_{even} \oplus V_{odd}\otimes W_{odd})
  \oplus
  (V_{even} \otimes W_{odd} \oplus V_{odd} \otimes W_{even})
$$

but equipped with the non-trivial braiding morphism

$$
  b_{V, W} : V \otimes W \to W \otimes V
$$

that is the usual braiding isomorphism of [[Vect]] on $V_{even} \otimes W_{even}$ and on $V_{even} \otimes W_{odd} \oplus V_{odd} \otimes W_{even}$ but is $(-1)$ times this on $V_{odd}\otimes W_{odd}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SuperAlgebras}
###### Definition

A **super (associative) algebra** over $K$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

A **(graded)-commutative (associative) algebra** over $K$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

=--

This means that a commutative superalgebra is a [[super vector space]]

$$
  A = A_{even} \oplus A_{odd}
$$

equipped with a morphism of super vector spaces

$$
  (-)\cdot (-) : A \otimes A \to A
$$

that is associative and commutative in the usual sense. Spcifically for the commutativity this means that with $a,b  \in A_{odd}$ we have

$$
  a \cdot b = - b \cdot a
  \,.
$$

Whereas if either of $a$ or $b$ is in $A_{even}$ we have

$$
  a \cdot b = b \cdot a
  \,.
$$

#### Related notions
 {#RelatedNotions}

+-- {: .num_defn #Center}
###### Definition

The **[[center]]** of a superalgebra $A$ is the sub-superalgebra $Z(A) \hookrightarrow A$ spanned by all those elements $z \in A$ of homogeneous degree which graded-commute with all other homogeneois elements $a$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Opposite}
###### Definition

For $A$ a superalgebra, its **opposite** $A^{op}$ is the superalgebra with the same underlying [[super vector space]] as $A$, and with multiplication defined on homogeneous elements by

$$
  a_1 \cdot_{A^{op}} a_2 \coloneqq (-1)^{{\vert a_1\vert}{\vert a_2\vert}} a_2 \cdot_{A} a_1
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #CentralSimple}
###### Definition

A superalgebra $A$ is called **central simple** if 

1. its [[center]], def. \ref{Center} is the ground field;

1. its only 2-sided graded [[ideals]] are $0$ and $A$ itself.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #AlgWithBimodules}
###### Definition

Write $2sVect \simeq sAlg$ for the [[2-category]] equivalent to the one whose [[objects]] are superalgebra, [[1-morphisms]] are [[bimodules]] and [[2-morphisms]] are intertwiners. This is naturally a [[monoidal 2-category]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #2sVect}
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[[2-vector space]]_ this is equivalently the 2-category of **super 2-vector spaces**. [[equivalence|Equivalence]] in $2sVect \simeq sAlg$ is also called _[[Morita equivalence]]_ of super-algebras.

=--
+-- {: .num_defn #Azumaya}
###### Definition

A superalgebra is an [[Azumaya algebra]] if it is an invertible object in the [[monoidal 2-category]] $s2Vect \simeq sAlg$, def. \ref{AlgWithBimodules}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The group of [[equivalence classes]] of Azumaya super algebras is called the super _[[Brauer group]]_, see there for more details.

=--


### Examples


#### Endomorphisms algebras, matrix algebras

+-- {: .num_defn #EndomorphismSuperalgebra}
###### Definition

For $V \in SVect$ a [[super vector space]], its [[endomorphism ring]] is canonically a super-algebra. Superalgebras isomorphic to ones of this form, are also called **matrix super algebras**.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EndomorphismSuperalgebrasAreCentralSimple}
###### Proposition

A matrix superalgebra, def. \ref{EndomorphismSuperalgebra} is central simple, def. \ref{CentralSimple}.

=--


#### Grassmann algebra 
 
* For $V$ a [[vector space]] or [[graded vector space]] the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet V$ is a super algebra. This are the _free_ superalgebras.

#### Clifford algebra 

An class of examples of non-(graded)-commutative superalgebra 
are [[Clifford algebra]].

In fact, let $V$ be a [[vector space]] equipped with symmetric [[inner product]]
$\langle -,- \range$. Write $\wedge^\bullet V$ be the [[Grassmann algebra]] on $V$. The inner product makes this a super [[Poisson algebra]]. The [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V, \langle \rangl)$ is the [[deformation quantization]] of this.

+-- {: .num_example #ComplexCl1}
###### Example

There is a superalgebra over the [[complex numbers]] of the form

$$
  A = \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}\langle u\rangle
  \,,
$$

where the single odd generator satisfies $u \cdot u = 1$.

=--


### Properties
 {#Properties}

#### General

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A superalgebra is isomorphic to a matrix algebra, def. \ref{EndomorphismSuperalgebra} precisely if it is [[equivalence|equivalent]]  in  $2 sVect \simeq Alg$, def. \ref{AlgWithBimodules}, ([[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]]) to the ground field super algebra.

=--

#### Picard 3-group, Brauer group
 {#Picard2Groupoid}

We discuss the [[Picard 3-group]] of $2sVect \simeq sAlg$, def. \ref{AlgWithBimodules}, hence the corresponding [[Brauer group]].

+-- {: .num_theorem #AzumayaAreCentralSimple}
###### Theorem

A superalgebra is invertible/Azumaya, def. \ref{Azumaya}, precisely if it is finite dimensional and central simple, def. \ref{CentralSimple}.

=--

This is due to ([Wall](#Wall)).

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

The [[Brauer group]] of superalgebras over the [[complex numbers]] is the [[cyclic group of order 2]]. That over the [[real numbers]] is cyclic of order 8:

$$
  sBr(\mathbb{C}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
$$
$$
  sBr(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_8
  \,.
$$

The non-trivial element in $sBr(\mathbb{R})$ is that presented by the superalgebra $\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C} u$ of example \ref{ComplexCl1}, with $u \cdot u = 1$.

=--

This is due to ([Wall](#Wall)).

The following generalizes this to the higher [[homotopy groups]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[homotopy groups]] of the [[braided 3-group]] $sAlg^\times$ of Azumaya superalgebra are

| | $sAlg^\times_{\mathbb{C}}$ | $sAlg^\times_{\mathbb{R}}$ |
|--|--|--|
| $\pi_2$ | $\mathbb{C}^\times$ | $\mathbb{R}^\times$
| $\pi_1$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$
| $\pi_0$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_8$

where the [[groups of units]] $\mathbb{C}^\times$ and $\mathbb{R}^\times$ are regarded as [[discrete groups]].

=--

This appears in ([Freed, (1.38)](#Freed)).


## Algebra in the topos over superpoints
 {#AlgebraOverSuperpoints}

We now consider [[higher algebra]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] over [[super points]]: the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Super∞Grpd]].

### The topos

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $SuperPoint$ for the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s. Write 

$$
  SuperSet := Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the [[sheaf topos]] (a [[presheaf topos]]) over this site.
Write 

$$
  Super \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SuperPoint)
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over this site: the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[super ∞-groupoid]]s.

=--

### The line object $\mathbb{R}$
 {#AlgebraInToposOverSuperPoints-TheLineObject}

+-- {: .num_defn #EmbeddingOfSupermanifoldsIntoSheavesOnSuperpoints}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  j \colon SuperSmthMfd \hookrightarrow Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the restricted [[Yoneda embedding]] of [[supermanifolds]] given by the canonical inclusion $SuperPoint \hookrightarrow SuperSmoothManifold$.

=--




+-- {: .num_defn #TheRealLine}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  \mathbb{R} := j(\mathbb{R}) \in Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the presheaf represented by the [[real line]], regarded as a [[supermanifold]]. Equipped with its canonical [[internalization|internal]] [[ring]] structure this is 

$$
  \mathbb{R} \in Ring(Sh(SuperPoint))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at [[supermanifold]] (in the section [As locally ringed spaces - Properties](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/supermanifold#AsLocallyRingedSpacesProperties)) $\mathbb{R}$ sends the formal dual of a [[Grassmann algebra]] to its even subalgebra

$$
  \mathbb{R}  : Spec \wedge^\bullet V \mapsto (\wedge^\bullet V)_{even}
  \,.
$$

This is canonically equipped with the structure of a (unital) [[commutative ring]] in $SuperSet$.

=--

In ([Sachse](#Sachse)) this appears around (21).


### $\mathbb{R}$-Modules
 {#SuperModulesAsbbKModules}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $Mod_{\mathbb{R}}(SuperSet)$ for the [[Mod|category of modules]] over $\mathbb{R}$ of def. \ref{TheRealLine} in $SuperSet$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EmbeddingOfSVectIntoKMod}
###### Proposition

The restriction of the embedding of def. \ref{EmbeddingOfSupermanifoldsIntoSheavesOnSuperpoints} to supermanifolds which are [[super vector spaces]] is a [[functor]]

$$
  j : SVect_{\mathbb{R}} = Mod_{\mathbb{R}}(Set) \hookrightarrow Mod_{\mathbb{K}}(SuperSet)
$$

from real [[super vector spaces]]  to internal modules over $\mathbb{R}$ that sends $V \in SVect_{\mathbb{R}}$ to

$$
  j(V) : Spec \Lambda \mapsto (\Lambda \otimes_\mathbb{R} V)_{even}
  = 
  (\Lambda_{even} \otimes_\mathbb{R} V_{even})
    \oplus
  (\Lambda_{odd} \otimes_\mathbb{R} V_{odd})
  \,.
$$

This is a [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, corollary 3.2](#Sachse)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is a variation on the [[Yoneda lemma]].

=--

This means that ordinary [[super vector spaces]] are embedded as a [[full subcategory]] in $\mathbb{K}$-modules in the topos over [[super points]].

### Associative and Lie Superalgebras

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor $j$ from prop \ref{EmbeddingOfSVectIntoKMod} induces a [[full and faithful functor]]

$$
  SAlg_{\mathbb{R}}(Set) \hookrightarrow Alg_{\mathbb{R}}(SuperSet)
$$

of superalgebras over $\mathbb{R}$ as in def. \ref{SuperAlgebras} and internal [[associative algebra]]s over $\mathbb{R}$ in $SuperSet$.

Similarly we have a faithful embedding

$$
  SLieAlg_{\mathbb{R}}(Set) \hookrightarrow LieAlg_{\mathbb{R}}(SuperSet)
$$

of ordinary [[super Lie algebras]] over $\mathbb{R}$ into the internal [[Lie algebras]] over $\mathbb{R}$.

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, corollary 3.3](#Sachse)).
