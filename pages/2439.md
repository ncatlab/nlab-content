## Idea
 {#Idea}

### Basic idea

In the general sense, _superalgebra_ is the study of ([[higher algebra|higher]]) [[algebra]] 

* [[internalization|internal]] to the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector spaces]] ([[super vector spaces]]);

equivalently 

* over the [[base topos]] on [[superpoints]].

More specifically, an _associative superalgebra_ is an [[associative algebra]] in the context of superalgebra. As in the ordinary case, this is often just called _a superalgebra_ , too.


In the following we first discuss

* _[Associative superalgebras](#AssociativeSuperalgebras)_

as [[monoids]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector spaces]]. Then we pass to the perspective of

* _[Algebra in the topos over superpoints](#AlgebraOverSuperpoints)_

and consider systematically [[algebra]] in the [[sheaf topos]] over the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s and show how this reproduces and generalizes the previous notions.

See ([Sachse](#Sachse)) and the references at _[[super ∞-groupoid]]_ for some history of the topos-theoretic perspective on superalgebra.


### Abstract idea
 {#AbstractIdea}

We discuss the general abstract _raison d' &ecirc;tre_ of super algebra. Readers looking for just the plain definition should probably [skip to below](#AssociativeSuperalgebras) on first reading.

Superalgebra is [[universal property|universal]] in the following sense. The crucial super-grading rule (the "Koszul sign rule") 

$$
  a \otimes b = (-1)^{deg(a) deg(b)} b \otimes a
$$

in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded vector spaces]] is induced from the [[subcategory]] which is the [[abelian 2-group]] of metric graded [[lines]]. This in turn is the [[free construction|free]] [[abelian 2-group]] (groupal [[symmetric monoidal category]]) on a single generator.  (This point of view is amplified for instance in the first part of ([Kapranov 13](#Kapranov13)), whose second part is about [[super 2-algebra]]). Generally then super-grading and hence super-algebra arises from the [[truncated object|2-truncation]] (3-[[coskeleton]]) of the free [[abelian ∞-group]] on a single generator, which is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$. So the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading of superalgebra comes from the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_n(\mathbb{S})$ in degree 1 and 2:

| $n = $ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $\cdots$ | 
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--|
| $\pi_n(\mathbb{S}) = $ | $\mathbb{Z}$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$ | $ 0 $ | $0$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_{240}$ | $\cdots$ |
| meaning: | degree | [[boson]]/[[fermion]] super-degree | [[spin geometry|spin]] | [[string geometry|string]] | $-$ | $-$ | ? | ? | $\cdots$ |
| [[free construction|free object]] on single [[generators and relations|generator]]: | [[abelian group]] | [[abelian 2-group]] | [[abelian 3-group]] | [[abelian 4-group]] |  |  | [[abelian 7-group]] | [[abelian ∞-group|abelian 8-group]] | [[abelian ∞-group]] | 



This suggests (as hinted at in ([Kapranov 13](#Kapranov13))) that in full generality [[higher geometry|higher]] [[supergeometry]] is to be thought of as $\mathbb{S}$-[[graded object|graded]] geometry, hence [[Isbell duality|dually]] as [[higher algebra]] with [[∞-group of units]] [[augmented ∞-group|augmented]] over the [[sphere spectrum]]. 

But notice that this is canonically so for every [[E-∞ ring]], see at _[∞-group of units -- Augmented definition](infinity-group+of+units#AugmentedDefinition)_. This would mean: In [[higher geometry]]/[[higher algebra]] supergeometry/superalgebra is intrinsic, canonically given. 


Using this together with [[Hisham Sati|Sati]]'s _[[Geometric and topological structures related to M-branes]]_ and the [[image of the J-homomorphism]]

[[!include image of J -- table]]


we can derive the terminology in the above table as indicated now. 

> The following uses the notions of _[[motivic quantization]]_ as indicated there, to be expanded.

* **$d = 1$ [[sigma-model]]** 

  The [[local coefficients]] for [[quantization|quantizing]] the ([[spinning particle|spinning]]) [[particle]] on the [[boundary]] of the [[string]] ending on a [[D-brane]] (by K-theoretic [[geometric quantization by push-forward]]/[[D-brane charge]]) are

  $$
    \array{   
      B BU(1)
      &\simeq&
      B K(\mathbb{Z},2)
      &\to& 
      B gl_1(KU) 
      &\to&
      KU \text{-}Mod
    }
  $$

  for $KU$ the [[complex K-theory spectrum]] [[E-∞ ring]], and
  hence the characteristic twists are in degree 2 of the group of units, hence of the [graded ∞-group of units](infinity-group%20of%20units#AugmentedDefinition)

  $$
    gl^{gr}_1(KU) \to \mathbb{S}
  $$

  hence are graded by the second [[homotopy group]] 

  $$  
    \pi_2(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
  $$

  of the sphere spectrum.

* **$d = 2$ [[sigma-model]]** 

  The [[local coefficients]] for [[quantization|quantizing]] the [[string]] (on the [[boundary]] of the [[M2-brane]] ending on an [[M9-brane]]) are

  $$
    \array{   
      B B^2 U(1)
      &\simeq&
      B K(\mathbb{Z},3)
      &\to& 
      B gl_1(tmf) 
      &\to&
      tmf \text{-}Mod
    }
  $$

  for the [[tmf]] [[E-∞ ring]], and
  hence the characteristic twists are in degree 3 of the group of units, hence of the graded group of units

  $$
    gl^{gr}_1(tmf) \to \mathbb{S}
  $$

  hence are graded by the third [[homotopy group]] 

  $$  
    \pi_3(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{24}
  $$

  of the sphere spectrum.

* **$d = 5$ [[sigma-model]]** 

  The [[local coefficients]] for [[quantization|quantizing]] the [[Yang monopole]] (on the [[boundary]] of the [[M5-brane]] ending on an [[M9-brane]]) are

  $$
    \array{   
      B B^5 U(1)
      &\simeq&
      B K(\mathbb{Z},6)
      &\to& 
      B gl_1(K(5)) 
      &\to&
      K(5) \text{-}Mod
    }
    \,,
  $$

  and
  hence the characteristic twists are in degree 6 of the group of units, hence of the graded group of units

  $$
    gl^{gr}_1(K(5)) \to \mathbb{S}
  $$

  hence are graded by the sixth [[homotopy group]] 

  $$  
    \pi_6(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{2}
  $$

  of the sphere spectrum.


## Associative superalgebras
 {#AssociativeSuperalgebras}

### Definition

#### Superalgebras

An ordinary [[associative algebra]] (a [[vector space]] with a linear and associative and unital product operation) is a [[monoid]] in the [[monoidal category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]].

Throughout, fix a [[field]] $k$ of [[characteristic]] 0.

+-- {: .num_defn #SuperVectorSpaces}
###### Definition

Write [[SVect]] for the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector space]]s over $k$. This is the [[category]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space]]s equipped with the unique non-trivial symmetric [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal structure]].

Objects are vector spaces with a [[direct sum]] decomposition

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}
$$

and the [[tensor product]] is given in terms of that on vector spaces by

$$
  V \otimes W = 
  (V_{even} \otimes W_{even} \oplus V_{odd}\otimes W_{odd})
  \oplus
  (V_{even} \otimes W_{odd} \oplus V_{odd} \otimes W_{even})
$$

but equipped with the non-trivial braiding morphism

$$
  b_{V, W} : V \otimes W \to W \otimes V
$$

that is the usual braiding isomorphism of [[Vect]] on $V_{even} \otimes W_{even}$ and on $V_{even} \otimes W_{odd} \oplus V_{odd} \otimes W_{even}$ but is $(-1)$ times this on $V_{odd}\otimes W_{odd}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SuperAlgebras}
###### Definition

A **super (associative) algebra** over $K$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

A **[[graded commutative algebra|(graded)-commutative (associative) algebra]]** over $K$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

=--

This means that a commutative superalgebra is a [[super vector space]]

$$
  A = A_{even} \oplus A_{odd}
$$

equipped with a morphism of super vector spaces

$$
  (-)\cdot (-) : A \otimes A \to A
$$

that is associative and commutative in the usual sense. Spcifically for the commutativity this means that with $a,b  \in A_{odd}$ we have

$$
  a \cdot b = - b \cdot a
  \,.
$$

Whereas if either of $a$ or $b$ is in $A_{even}$ we have

$$
  a \cdot b = b \cdot a
  \,.
$$

#### Related notions
 {#RelatedNotions}

+-- {: .num_defn #Center}
###### Definition

The **[[center]]** of a superalgebra $A$ is the sub-superalgebra $Z(A) \hookrightarrow A$ spanned by all those elements $z \in A$ of homogeneous degree which graded-commute with all other homogeneois elements $a$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Opposite}
###### Definition

For $A$ a superalgebra, its **opposite** $A^{op}$ is the superalgebra with the same underlying [[super vector space]] as $A$, and with multiplication defined on homogeneous elements by

$$
  a_1 \cdot_{A^{op}} a_2 \coloneqq (-1)^{{\vert a_1\vert}{\vert a_2\vert}} a_2 \cdot_{A} a_1
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #CentralSimple}
###### Definition

A superalgebra $A$ is called **central simple** if 

1. its [[center]], def. \ref{Center} is the ground field;

1. its only 2-sided graded [[ideals]] are $0$ and $A$ itself.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #AlgWithBimodules}
###### Definition

Write $2sVect \simeq sAlg$ for the [[2-category]] equivalent to the one whose [[objects]] are superalgebra, [[1-morphisms]] are [[bimodules]] and [[2-morphisms]] are intertwiners. This is naturally a [[monoidal 2-category]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #2sVect}
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[[2-vector space]]_ this is equivalently the 2-category of **super 2-vector spaces**. [[equivalence|Equivalence]] in $2sVect \simeq sAlg$ is also called _[[Morita equivalence]]_ of super-algebras.

=--
+-- {: .num_defn #Azumaya}
###### Definition

A superalgebra is an [[Azumaya algebra]] if it is an invertible object in the [[monoidal 2-category]] $s2Vect \simeq sAlg$, def. \ref{AlgWithBimodules}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The group of [[equivalence classes]] of Azumaya super algebras is called the super _[[Brauer group]]_, see there for more details.

=--


### Examples


#### Endomorphisms algebras, matrix algebras

+-- {: .num_defn #EndomorphismSuperalgebra}
###### Definition

For $V \in SVect$ a [[super vector space]], its [[endomorphism ring]] is canonically a super-algebra. Superalgebras isomorphic to ones of this form, are also called **matrix super algebras**.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EndomorphismSuperalgebrasAreCentralSimple}
###### Proposition

A matrix superalgebra, def. \ref{EndomorphismSuperalgebra} is central simple, def. \ref{CentralSimple}.

=--


#### Grassmann algebra 
 
* For $V$ a [[vector space]] or [[graded vector space]] the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet V$ is a super algebra. This are the _free_ superalgebras.

#### Clifford algebra 

An class of examples of non-(graded)-commutative superalgebra 
are [[Clifford algebra]].

In fact, let $V$ be a [[vector space]] equipped with symmetric [[inner product]]
$\langle -,- \range$. Write $\wedge^\bullet V$ be the [[Grassmann algebra]] on $V$. The inner product makes this a super [[Poisson algebra]]. The [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V, \langle \rangl)$ is the [[deformation quantization]] of this.

+-- {: .num_example #ComplexCl1}
###### Example

There is a superalgebra over the [[complex numbers]] of the form

$$
  A = \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}\langle u\rangle
  \,,
$$

where the single odd generator satisfies $u \cdot u = 1$.

+-- {: .num_defn #InclusionOfCommutativeSuperalgebras}
###### Definition

Given some [[ground field]] $k$, write

$$
  \iota \colon CAlg_k \hookrightarrow SCAlg_k
$$

for the [[full subcategory]] of ordinary [[commutative algebras]]
over $k$ into commutative super-algebras (as those having trivial odd part).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra}
###### Proposition

The inclusion $\iota$ of def. \ref{InclusionOfCommutativeSuperalgebras}
has 

1. a [[right adjoint]] $(-)_{even}$ given by restricting a superalgebra
to its even part;

1. a [[left adjoint]] $(-)/((-)_{odd})$ given by forming the "[[body]]", the [[quotient]] by the ideal generated by the odd part (by the "[[soul]]").


=--

This is immediate. See further discussion see for instance [Carchedi-Roytenberg 12, example 3.18](#CarchediRoytenberg12)

+-- {: .num_remark #AdjointTripleBetweenPlainAndSuperalgebra}
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra} 
gives an [[adjoint triple]] of the form

$$
  CAlg_k \stackrel{\overset{(-)/((-)_{odd})}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\underset{(-)_{even}}{\longleftarrow}}}
  SCAlg_k
$$

and hence an [[adjoint cylinder]], which induces a pair of [[adjoint modalities]] ([[fermionic modality]] $\dashv$ [[bosonic modality]]).
See at _[[super smooth infinity-groupoid]]_ for more on this.

=--


#### Relation to matrix algebras

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A superalgebra is isomorphic to a matrix algebra, def. \ref{EndomorphismSuperalgebra}, precisely if it is [[equivalence|equivalent]]  in  $2 sVect \simeq Alg$, def. \ref{AlgWithBimodules}, ([[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]]) to the ground field super algebra.

=--

#### Picard 3-group, Brauer group
 {#Picard2Groupoid}

We discuss the [[Picard 3-group]] of $2sVect \simeq sAlg$, def. \ref{AlgWithBimodules}, hence the corresponding [[Brauer group]]. See also at _[[super line 2-bundle]]_.

+-- {: .num_theorem #AzumayaAreCentralSimple}
###### Theorem

A superalgebra is invertible/Azumaya, def. \ref{Azumaya}, precisely if it is finite dimensional and central simple, def. \ref{CentralSimple}.

=--

This is due to ([Wall](#Wall)).

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

The [[Brauer group]] of superalgebras over the [[complex numbers]] is the [[cyclic group of order 2]]. That over the [[real numbers]] is cyclic of order 8:

$$
  sBr(\mathbb{C}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2
$$
$$
  sBr(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_8
  \,.
$$

The non-trivial element in $sBr(\mathbb{R})$ is that presented by the superalgebra $\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C} u$ of example \ref{ComplexCl1}, with $u \cdot u = 1$.

=--

This is due to ([Wall](#Wall)).

The following generalizes this to the higher [[homotopy groups]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[homotopy groups]] of the [[braided 3-group]] $sAlg^\times$ of Azumaya superalgebra are

| | $sAlg^\times_{\mathbb{C}}$ | $sAlg^\times_{\mathbb{R}}$ |
|--|--|--|
| $\pi_2$ | $\mathbb{C}^\times$ | $\mathbb{R}^\times$
| $\pi_1$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$
| $\pi_0$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_8$

where the [[groups of units]] $\mathbb{C}^\times$ and $\mathbb{R}^\times$ are regarded as [[discrete groups]].

=--

This appears in ([Freed, (1.38)](#Freed)).


## Algebra in the topos over superpoints
 {#AlgebraOverSuperpoints}

We now consider [[higher algebra]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] over [[super points]]: the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Super∞Grpd]].

### The topos

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $SuperPoint$ for the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s. Write 

$$
  SuperSet := Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the [[sheaf topos]] (a [[presheaf topos]]) over this site.
Write 

$$
  Super \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SuperPoint)
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over this site: the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[super ∞-groupoid]]s.

=--

### The line object $\mathbb{R}$
 {#AlgebraInToposOverSuperPoints-TheLineObject}

+-- {: .num_defn #EmbeddingOfSupermanifoldsIntoSheavesOnSuperpoints}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  j \colon SuperSmthMfd \hookrightarrow Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the restricted [[Yoneda embedding]] of [[supermanifolds]] given by the canonical inclusion $SuperPoint \hookrightarrow SuperSmoothManifold$.

=--




+-- {: .num_defn #TheRealLine}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  \mathbb{R} := j(\mathbb{R}) \in Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the presheaf represented by the [[real line]], regarded as a [[supermanifold]]. Equipped with its canonical [[internalization|internal]] [[ring]] structure this is 

$$
  \mathbb{R} \in Ring(Sh(SuperPoint))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


By the discussion at [[supermanifold]] (in the section [As locally ringed spaces - Properties](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/supermanifold#AsLocallyRingedSpacesProperties)) $\mathbb{R}$ sends the formal dual of a [[Grassmann algebra]] to its even subalgebra

$$
  \mathbb{R}  : Spec \wedge^\bullet V \mapsto (\wedge^\bullet V)_{even}
  \,.
$$

This is canonically equipped with the structure of a (unital) [[commutative ring]] in $SuperSet$.


=--

In ([Sachse](#Sachse)) this appears around (21).


### $\mathbb{R}$-Modules
 {#SuperModulesAsbbKModules}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $Mod_{\mathbb{R}}(SuperSet)$ for the [[Mod|category of modules]] over $\mathbb{R}$ of def. \ref{TheRealLine} in $SuperSet$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EmbeddingOfSVectIntoKMod}
###### Proposition

The restriction of the embedding of def. \ref{EmbeddingOfSupermanifoldsIntoSheavesOnSuperpoints} to supermanifolds which are [[super vector spaces]] is a [[functor]]

$$
  j : SVect_{\mathbb{R}} = Mod_{\mathbb{R}}(Set) \hookrightarrow Mod_{\mathbb{K}}(SuperSet)
$$

from real [[super vector spaces]]  to internal modules over $\mathbb{R}$ that sends $V \in SVect_{\mathbb{R}}$ to

$$
  j(V) : Spec \Lambda \mapsto (\Lambda \otimes_\mathbb{R} V)_{even}
  = 
  (\Lambda_{even} \otimes_\mathbb{R} V_{even})
    \oplus
  (\Lambda_{odd} \otimes_\mathbb{R} V_{odd})
  \,.
$$

This is a [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, corollary 3.2](#Sachse)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is a variation on the [[Yoneda lemma]].

=--

This means that ordinary [[super vector spaces]] are embedded as a [[full subcategory]] in $\mathbb{K}$-modules in the topos over [[super points]].

### Associative and Lie Superalgebras

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor $j$ from prop \ref{EmbeddingOfSVectIntoKMod} induces a [[full and faithful functor]]

$$
  SAlg_{\mathbb{R}}(Set) \hookrightarrow Alg_{\mathbb{R}}(SuperSet)
$$

of superalgebras over $\mathbb{R}$ as in def. \ref{SuperAlgebras} and internal [[associative algebra]]s over $\mathbb{R}$ in $SuperSet$.

Similarly we have a faithful embedding

$$
  SLieAlg_{\mathbb{R}}(Set) \hookrightarrow LieAlg_{\mathbb{R}}(SuperSet)
$$

of ordinary [[super Lie algebras]] over $\mathbb{R}$ into the internal [[Lie algebras]] over $\mathbb{R}$.

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, corollary 3.3](#Sachse)).
