## Idea

In the general sense, _superalgebra_ is the study of ([[higher algebra|higher]]) [[algebra]] over the [[base topos]] on [[superpoint]]s.

More specifically, an _associative superalgebra_ is an [[associative algebra]] in the context of superalgebra. As in the ordinary case, this is often just called _a superalgebra_ , too.

In the following we first discuss

* [Associatvive superalgebra](#AssociativeSuperalgebras)

as [[monoid]]s in the [[braided monoidal category]] of [[super vector space]]s. Then we pass to the more abstract picture of

* [Algebra in the topos over superpoints](#AlgebraOverSuperpoints)

and consider systematically [[algebra]] in the [[sheaf topos]] over the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s and show how this reproduces and generalizes the previous notions.

See ([Sachse](#Sachse)) and the references at [[super ∞-groupoid]] for some history of the topos-theoretic perspective on superalgebra.


## Associative superalgebras
 {#AssociativeSuperalgebras}

### Definition

An ordinary [[associative algebra]] (a [[vector space]] with a linear and associative and unital product operation) is a [[monoid]] in the [[monoidal category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]].

Throughout, fix a [[field]] $k$ of [[characteristic]] 0.

+-- {: .num_defn #SuperVectorSpaces}
###### Definition

Write [[SVect]] for the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector space]]s over $k$. This is the [[category]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space]]s equipped with the unique non-trivial symmetric [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal structure]].

Objects are vector spaces with a [[direct sum]] decomposition

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}
$$

and the [[tensor product]] is given in terms of that on vector spaces by

$$
  V \otimes W = 
  (V_{even} \otimes W_{even} \oplus V_{odd}\otimes W_{odd})
  \oplus
  (V_{even} \otimes W_{odd} \oplus V_{odd} \otimes W_{even})
$$

but equipped with the non-trivial braiding morphism

$$
  b_{V, W} : V \otimes W \to W \otimes V
$$

that is the usual braiding isomorphism of [[Vect]] on $V_{even} \otimes W_{even}$ and on $V_{even} \otimes W_{odd} \oplus V_{odd} \otimes W_{even}$ but is $(-1)$ times this on $V_{odd}\otimes W_{odd}$.

###### Definition

A **super algebra** over $K$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

A **(graded)-commutative algebra** over $K$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

=--

This means that a commutative superalgebra is a [[super vector space]]

$$
  A = A_{even} \oplus A_{odd}
$$

equipped with a morphism of super vector spaces

$$
  (-)\cdot (-) : A \otimes A \to A
$$

that is associative and commutative in the usual sense. Spcifically for the commutativity this means that with $a,b  \in A_{odd}$ we have

$$
  a \cdot b = - b \cdot a
  \,.
$$

Whereas if either of $a$ or $b$ is in $A_{even}$ we have

$$
  a \cdot b = b \cdot a
  \,.
$$

### Examples

#### Grassmann algebra 
 
* For $V$ a [[vector space]] or [[graded vector space]] the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet V$ is a super algebra. This are the _free_ superalgebras.

#### Clifford algebra 

An class of examples of non-(graded)-commutative superalgebra 
are [[Clifford algebra]].

In fact, let $V$ be a [[vector space]] equipped with symmetric [[inner product]]
$\langle -,- \range$. Write $\wedge^\bullet V$ be the [[Grassmann algebra]] on $V$. The inner product makes this a super [[Poisson algebra]]. The [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V, \langle \rangl)$ is the [[deformation quantization]] of this.


## Algebra in the topos over superpoints
 {#AlgebraOverSuperpoints}

We now consider [[higher algebra]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] over [[super points]]: the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Super∞Grpd]].

### The topos

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $SuperPoint$ for the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s. Write 

$$
  SuperSet := Sh(SuperPoint)
$$

for the [[sheaf topos]] (a [[presheaf topos]]) over this site.
Write 

$$
  Super \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SuperPoint)
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over this site: the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[super ∞-groupoid]]s.

=--

### The line object $\mathbb{K}$

The canonical [[line object]] in $Sh(SuperPoint)$ is 

$$
  \mathbb{A}^1  = Spec F(*) = \mathbb{R}^{0|1}
  \,,
$$ 

the [[odd line]]. 

As a presheaf $\mathbb{R}^{0|1} : (Gr^{op})^{op} \to Set$ this assigns

$$
  \mathbb{A}^1 : Spec \wedge^\bullet V \mapsto (\wedge^\bullet V)_{odd}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Consider analogously the presheaf $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{K}^1$ defined by

$$
  \mathbb{K}^1  : Spec \wedge^\bullet V \mapsto (\wedge^\bullet V)_{even}
  \,.
$$

This is canonically equipped with the structure of a (unital) [[commutative ring]] in $SuperSet$.

=--

In ([Sachse](#Sachse)) this appears around (21).


### $\mathbb{K}$-Modules

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $Mod_{\mathbb{K}}(SuperSet)$ for the [[Mod|category of modules]] over $\mathbb{K}$ in $SuperSet$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EmbeddingOfSVectIntoKMod}
###### Proposition

There is a [[functor]]

$$
  j : SVect_k = Mod_k(Set) \hookrightarrow Mod_{\mathbb{K}}(SuperSet)
$$

from [[super vector space]]s over $k$ to internal modules over $\mathbb{K}$ that sends $V \in SVect_k$ to

$$
  j(V) : Spec \Lambda \mapsto (\Lambda \otimes_k V)_{even}
  = 
  (\Lambda_{even} \otimes_k V_{even})
    \oplus
  (\Lambda_{odd} \otimes_k V_{odd})
  \,.
$$

This is a [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, corollary 3.2](#Sachse)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is a variation on the [[Yoneda lemma]].

=--

This means that ordinary [[super vector space]]s are embedded as a [[full subcategory]] in $\mathbb{K}$-modules in the topos over [[super point]].

### Associative and Lie Superalgebras

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor $j$ from prop \ref{EmbeddingOfSVectIntoKMod} induces a [[full and faithful functor]]

$$
  SAlg_k(Set) \hookrightarrow Alg_{\mathbb{K}}(SuperSet)
$$

of superalgebras over $k$ as in def. \ref{SuperAlgebras} and internal [[associative algebra]]s over $\mathbb{K}$ in $SuperSet$.

Similarly we have a faithful embedding

$$
  SLieAlg_k(Set) \hookrightarrow LieAlg_{\mathbb{K}}(SuperSet)
$$

of ordinary [[super Lie algebra]]s over $k$ into the internal [[Lie algebra]]s over $\mathbb{K}$.

=--

This appears as ([Sachse, corollary 3.3](#Sachse)).
