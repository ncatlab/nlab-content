#Definition#

Recall that an ordinary [[algebra]] (a [[vector space]] with a linear and associative and unital product operation) is a [[monoid]] in the [[category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]].

Accordingly, **super algebra** is a [[monoid]] in the [[category]] [[SVect]] of [[super vector space]]s.

#Examples#

## Grassmann algebra ##
 
* For $V$ a [[vector space]] or [[graded vector space]] the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet V$ is a super algebra. This are the _free_ superalgebras.

## Clifford algebra ##

See [[Clifford algebra]].
