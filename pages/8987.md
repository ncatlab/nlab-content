## Idea

Given a [[presymplectic form]] $(X, \omega)$ (hence any closed [[differential 2-form]]), a _[[prequantization]]_ of it in the traditional sense is a choice of [[circle bundle with connection]] on $X$ whose [[curvature]] 2-form is $\omega$. Since the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ is equivalent, as a [[smooth âˆž-group]] to the [[2-group]] coming from the [[crossed module]] $(\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R})$, such a lift exists whenever the [[periods]] of $\omega$ are integral, hence are in the inclusion of the [[integers]] into the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

But conversely this means that for _any_ closed differential 2-form $\omega$ there is a [[connection on a 2-bundle]] on a $(\Gamma \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R})$-[[principal 2-bundle]], where $\Gamma \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the inclusion of the [[discrete group]] of [[periods]] of $\omega$.

If $\Gamma$ here is not finitely generated, then the [[smooth 2-group]] $(\Gamma \to \mathbb{R})$ is not equivalent to a smooth 1-group, and hence this is a genuine case of _[[higher geometric prequantization]]_. The upshot being that while not every closed 2-form has an ordinary [[prequantization]], it always does have one in [[higher geometric prequantization]], at least if we admit to choose the structure 2-group accordingly.

These considerations are currently mostly motivated purely mathematically. But the claim is that there useful physical applications (... eventually to be added here...).
