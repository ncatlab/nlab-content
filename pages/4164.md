## Idea ##
The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is a theorem about [[local nets]] in the [[Haag-Kastler approach]] to [[quantum field theory]]. It states that for certain nets the set of vectors $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}) \Omega$ (local algebra of a bounded open set applied to the vacuum vector, see [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]] for definitions and details) is dense in the given state space, a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.

The Reeh-Schlieder theorem can be proven to be valid in the [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]], but the statement itself is sometimes used as an axiom and called the **Reeh-Schlieder property** in this case.

The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is of central importance for the mathematical structure theory of the [[Haag-Kastler approach]]. The _physical interpretation_ is counterintuitive and therefore to a certain degree controversial: Intuitively one might expect that for a localized observable $A \in \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O})$ the vector $A \Omega$ should be localized in $\mathcal{O}$, that is the state should look like the vacuum in the causal complement of $\mathcal{O}$. But the Reeh-Schlieder theorem says that every, arbitrary state can be approximated by states of the kind $A \Omega$. This shows that the concept of _localized states_ is nontrivial in [[AQFT]] and needs to be handled with care.

Complementary statements about the asymptotic "vacuum-like appearance" of localized observables exist, too, and are commonly called [[cluster theorem]]s.
