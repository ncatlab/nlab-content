## Idea

In [[gravity]],  __Bekenstein-Hawking entropy__ is an [[entropy]] assigned to [[black hole]], on the basis of laws of thermodynamics and observers outside black hole.  It striking property is that it is proportional to the surface area of the balck hole's [[horizon]].

## Properties

### Interpretation in AdS/CFT correspondence

In the context of [[string theory]] BH entropy is explained by a version of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. Here every [[black brane]] solution in [[supergravity]] is the strong-coupling limit of a [[D-brane]] [[worldvolume]] [[QFT]]. After [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] these black brane configurations become ordinary [[black hole]]s.  The [[entropy]] of the [[D-brane]] worldvolume theories on the [[event horizon]] turns out to coincide with the BH entropy of the corresponding black hole. 

Detailed computations exist in particular for [[D1-brane]]/[[D5-brane]] systems. This is parts of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. See ([AGMOO, chapter 5](#AGMOO)).

See also _[[string theory results applied elsewhere]]_.

### Interpretation by strong coupling limit of D-branes

Another way to derive Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in [[string theory]] is by computing the entropy of weakly coupled open strings on D-brane configurations in flat [[Minkowski space]] which transmute as the coupling constant is increased to given (supersymmetric) black hole configurations. More on this is at _[[black holes in string theory]]_.

This article showed that under some assumptions the [[Einstein equations]] can even be _derived_ from identifying gravitational horizon area with [[entropy]] and them imposing laws of [[thermodynamics]].

(Later authors tried to argue that derivations like this show that gravity is not a fundamental force of nature such as [[electromagnetism]] or the [[strong nuclear force]], but rather an [[entropic force]] that arises only from more fundamental forces in a [[thermodynamic limit]]. This however remains at best unclear.)
