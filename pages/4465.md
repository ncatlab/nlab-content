## Idea

In [[gravity]],  __Bekenstein-Hawking entropy__ is an [[entropy]] assigned to [[black hole]], on the basis of laws of thermodynamics and observers outside black hole.  It striking property is that it is proportional to the surface area of the balck hole's [[horizon]].

## Properties

### Interpretation in AdS/CFT correspondence

In the context of [[string theory]] BH entropy is explained by a version of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. Here every [[black brane]] solution in [[supergravity]] is the strong-coupling limit of a [[D-brane]] [[worldvolume]] [[QFT]]. After [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] these black brane configurations become ordinary [[black hole]]s.  The [[entropy]] of the [[D-brane]] worldvolume theories on the [[event horizon]] turns out to coincide with the BH entropy of the corresponding black hole. 

Detailed computations exist in particular for [[D1-brane]]/[[D5-brane]] systems. This is parts of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]. See ([AGMOO, chapter 5](#AGMOO)).
