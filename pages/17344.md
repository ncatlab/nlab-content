## **Part 1) Stable homotopy theory**
 {#StableHomotopyTheory}


We now set up [[stable homotopy theory]].
 
**Literature.** For a decent quick idea see ([Malkiewich 14](#Malkiewich14)).
For a little more details the original lecture ([Adams 74, part III sections 2-7](#Adams74)) is still recommendable (except where it considers the [[stable homotopy category]] in its incarnation as the [[Adams category]], better to consider the [[homotopy category]] of the [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]; we go through this [below](#Spectra)). A detailed modern account is ([Schwede 12](#Schwede12)).

$\,$

Recall from the [[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- P|classical homotopy theory]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SuspensionAndLoopAreAdjointOnHomotopyCategory)) that the [[loop space]] functor $\Omega$ and the [[reduced suspension]] functor $\Sigma$ on the [[classical homotopy category]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] are [[adjoint functors]], with $\Sigma$ [[left adjoint]] and $\Omega$ [[right adjoint]]:

$$
  (\Sigma \dashv \Omega)
  \;\colon\;
  Ho(Top^{\ast/})
   \longrightarrow
  Ho(Top^{\ast/})
  \,.
$$

The _[[stable homotopy category]]_ $Ho(Spectra)$ is to be the result of stabilizing the adjunction in prop. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopAreAdjointOnHomotopyCategory}, in the sense of forcing it to become an [[equivalence of categories]]:

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top^{\ast/}) 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top^{\ast/})
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,,
$$

where $(\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty)$ is to be an adjunction universally "localizing" $Ho(Top^{\ast/})$ to $Ho(Spectra)$. 

The notation here is suggestive of the intuition behind how this stabilization will work: The universal way of making a topological space $X$ become stable under suspension is to pass to its infinite suspension in a suitable sense. That suitable sense is going to be called the _[[suspension spectrum]]_ of $X$. Conversely, if an object doesnt's change up to equivalence, by forming its loop spaces, it must give an [[infinite loop space]].

In contrast to the [[classical homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.


There is a variety of different models for the [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra, some of which roughly fits into a hierarchy like so:

1. [[sequential spectra]] with their [[model structure on sequential spectra]]

1. [[symmetric spectra]] with their [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

1. [[orthogonal spectra]] with their [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

1. [[excisive functors]] with their [[model structure for excisive functors]]

As one moves down this list, the objects modelling the spectra become richer. This means on the one hand that their abstract properties become better as one moves down the list, on the other hand it means that it is more immediate to construct and manipulate examples as one stays further up in the list. 

We start with plain sequential spectra [below](#SequentialSpectra) as a transparent means to see the [[stable homotopy category]]. When we get to the discussion of [[ring spectra]] [eventually](#RingSpectra) with the basic applications in mind, it is convenient to pass to the richer model of [[symmetric spectra]], [further below](#SymmetricSpectra).


### Motivating theorems

But first we now consider some facts in plain ("un-stable") [[algebraic topology]]/[[homotopy theory]] that serve to motivate the passeage to [[stable homotopy theory]] in the first place.


Motivation for stabilization under $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$:

* [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] (...[[May recognition theorem]])

* [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]

* [[triangulated category]]-structure on [[Spanier-Whitehead category]]

Further motivation which is the subject of the [seminar](#ComplexOrientedCohomology):

* [[generalized cohomology]]

  * [[suspension isomorphism]]

  * [[Brown representability theorem]]

* [[cobordism theory]]

  [[Thom's theorem]]




### **1.1)** Sequential spectra
 {#SequentialSpectra}

The most lighweight model for [[spectra]] are _[[sequential spectra]]_. They support most of [[stable homotopy theory]] in a straightforward way, and have the advantage that examples tend to be immediate (for instance the proof of the [[Brown representability theorem]] spits out sequential spectra). 

The key disadvantage of sequential spectra is that they do not support a functorial [[smash product of spectra]] before passing to the [[stable homotopy category]], much less a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]]. This is the structure needed for a decent discussion of the [[higher algebra]] of [[ring spectra]]. To accomodate this, further [below](#SymmetricSpectra) we enhance sequential spectra to the slightly richer model of [[symmetric spectra]]. But both these models are connected by a [[free-forgetful adjunction]] and for workinbg with either model it is useful to pass back and forth.

#### Sequential pre-spectra 

+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectrum}
###### Definition

A **[[sequential spectrum]]** (or sequential [[pre-spectrum]], for emphasis) in [[simplicial sets]], is an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial set]] $X_\bullet$ equipped with morphisms $\sigma_n \colon S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $S^1 \coloneqq \Delta[1]/\partial\Delta[1]$ is the minimal simplicial [[circle]], and where $\wedge$ is the [[smash product]] of [[pointed objects]].

 A [[homomorphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ of spectra is a sequence $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ of homomorphisms of pointed simplicial sets, such that all [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}& S^1 \wedge Y_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^X}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^Y}}
    \\
    X_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commute]].

Write $SeqSpec(sSet)$ for this [[category]] of sequential spectra.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #SmashProductOfSpectrumWithSimplicialSet}
###### Example

For $X \in SeqSpec(sSet)$ and $K \in $ [[sSet]], hence $K_+ \in sSet^{\ast/}$ then $X \wedge K_+$ is the sequential spectrum degreewise given by the [[smash product]] of pointed objects

$$
  (X \wedge K_+)_n \coloneqq (X_n \wedge K_+)
$$

and with structure maps given by

$$
  S^1 \wedge (X_n \wedge K_+) \simeq (S^1 \wedge X_n) \wedge K_+ \stackrel{\sigma_n \wedge K_+}{\longrightarrow} X_{n+1}\wedge K_+
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialEnrichment}
###### Proposition

The category $SeqSpec$ of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum} becomes a [[simplicially enriched category]] (in fact an $sSet^{\ast/}$-[[enriched category]]) with [[hom objects]] $[X,Y]\in sSet$ given by

$$
  [X,Y]_n \coloneqq Hom_{SeqSpec(sSet)}(X\wedge \Delta[n]_+,Y)
  \,.
$$

=--

We now consider the [[homotopy theory]] of sequential pre-spectra. The true [[stable homotopy theory]] below is obtained from this by passing from all pre-spectra to the [[Omega-spectra]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}
###### Definition

Say that a homomorphism $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ in the category $SeqSpec(sSet)$, def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum} is

* a **strict weak equivalence** if each component $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$ is a weak equivalence in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] (hence a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of [[geometric realizations]]);

* a **strict weak equivalence** if each component $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$ is a fibration in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] (hence a [[Kan fibration]]);

* a **strict cofibration** if the simplicial maps $f_0\colon X_0 \to Y_0$ as well as all [[pushout products]] of $f_n$ with the structure maps of $X$

  $$
    X_{n+1}\underset{S^1 \wedge X_n}{\coprod} S^1 \wedge Y_n
    \longrightarrow
    Y_{n+1}
  $$

  are cofibrations of simplicial sets in the  [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] (i.e.: [[monomorphisms]] of simplicial sets);

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}
###### Proposition

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} give the structure of a [[model category]] $SeqSpec(sSet)_{strict}$, called the **strict [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]** on sequential spectra.

Moreover, this is

* a [[proper model category]];

* a [[simplicial model category]] with respect to the simplicial enrichment of prop. \ref{SimplicialEnrichment}.

=--

([Bousfield-Friedlander 78, prop. 2.2](Bousfield-Friedlander+model+structure#BousfieldFriedlander78)). 


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $sSet^{\mathbb{N}}$ for the category of $\mathbb{N}$-sequences of simplicial sets. This may be thought of as the category of [[simplicial presheaves]] on the [[discrete category]] $\mathbb{N}^{op}$, and as such it carries the projective [[model structure on functors]]/[[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $sSet^{\mathbb{N}}_{proj}$.

Consider then the [[free-forgetful adjunction]]

$$
  SeqSpectra(sSet)
  \stackrel{\overset{F}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  sSet^{\mathbb{N}}
$$

and the corresponding [[transferred model structure]] $SeqSpectra(sSet)_{strict}$,

$$
  SeqSpectra(sSet)_{strict}
  \stackrel{\overset{F}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  sSet^{\mathbb{N}}_{proj}
  \,.
$$

It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed. To that end, consider a [[commuting square]] of sequential spectra

$$
  \array{
    X_\bullet &\stackrel{h_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}& A_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_\bullet}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\longrightarrow& B_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

By definition, this is equivalently a $\mathbb{N}$-collection of commuting diagrams of simplicial sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

such that all structure maps are respected.

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow && \searrow
    \\
    && B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    \\
    && A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[lifting]] in the original diagram is a lifting in each degree $n$, such that the lifting in degree $n+1$ makes these diagrams of structure maps commute.

Since components are parameterized over $\mathbb{N}$, this condition has solutions by [[induction]]. First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0. Then assume a lifting $l_n$ in degree $n$ has been found

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} &\nearrow_{\mathrlap{l_n}}& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

the lifting $l_{n+1}$ in the next degree has to also make the following diagram commute

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    & \searrow 
    \\
    Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    && 
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_{n+1}}} & \downarrow
    \\
    && A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

This is a [[cocone]] under the the commuting square for the structure maps, and therefore the outer diagram is equivalently a morphism out of the [[domain]] of the [[pushout product]] $f_n \Box \sigma_n^X$, while the compatible lift $l_{n+1}$ is equivalently a lift against this pushout product:

$$
  \array{
    Y_n \underset{X_n}{\sqcup} X_{n+1}
    &\stackrel{(\sigma_n^A l_n,h_{n+1})}{\longrightarrow}&
    A_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{l_{n+1}}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_{n+1} &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

#### The stable model structure on sequential spectra


In order to do [[stable homotopy theory]] with [[sequential spectra]], we need to equip the [[category]] of sequential [[pre-spectra]] of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum} with a [[model category]] structure whose weak equivalences are the [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] of def. \ref{StableWeakEquivalenceOfSequentialsSetSpectra}. This class contains the degreewise weak homotopy equivalences of the strict model structure of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} but is strictly larger. There are then different choices for the fibrations and cofibrations, but it is particularly convenient to keep the cofibrations those of the strict model structure, for then we are in the situation of [[Bousfield localization of model categories]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #BousfieldLocalizationOfModelCategories}
###### Definition


A _left [[Bousfield localization of model categories|Bousfield localization]]_ $C_{loc}$ of a [[model category]] $C$ is another model category structure on the same underlying category with the same cofibrations, 

$$
  cof_{C_{loc}} = cof_c
$$

but more weak equivalences

$$
  W_{C_{loc}} \supset W_C
  \,.
$$

=--

While that's a very simple definition, it turns out that something interesting happens to the fibrations when we keep the cofibrations fixed and increase the weak equivalences.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark 

In def. \ref{BousfieldLocalizationOfModelCategories} it follows directly that 

* $C_{loc}$ has as fibrations a subset of fibrations of $C$

  $$
    fib_{C_{loc}} = rlp(cof_{C_{loc}} \cap W_{C_{loc}})
    \subset rlp(cof_{C_{loc}} \cap W_C) = fib_{C}
    \,.
  $$

* $C_{loc}$ has the same acyclic fibrations as $C$

  $$
    fib_{C_{loc}} \cap W_{C_{loc}}
    =
    rlp(cof_{C_{loc}}) = rlp(cof_C) = fib_C \cap W_C
    \,.
  $$

* on the underlying categories

  * the identity functor $Id : C \to C_{loc}$ preserves cofibrations and weak equivalences

  * the identity functor $Id : C_{loc} \to C$ preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations

  so that this pair of functors is a [[Quillen adjunction]]

  $$
    C_{loc} \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} C
    \,,
  $$

The category $C^\circ$ _modeled_ by a model category $C$ is its [[full subcategory]] on fibrant-cofibrant objects. Under left Bousfield localization the fibrant-cofibrant objects of $C_{loc}$ are a subcollection of those of $C$, so that we have the full subcategory

$$
  (C_{loc})^\circ \subset C^\circ
  \,.
$$

Moreover, as we shall see, every object in $C$ is weakly equivalent in $C_{loc}$ to one in $C_{loc}$: it _reflects into $C_{loc}$_ .

Hence Bousfield localization is a model category version of reflecting onto a [[reflective subcategory]].

=--

(...)



In the situation of sequential spectra, we have more structure controlling the left Bousfield localization:

1. every sequential pre-spectrum is weakly equivalent to an [[Omega-spectrum]], def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum};

1. the strict weak equivalences between [[Omega-spectra]] are already [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]].

The structures in both these items are reflected by the [[spectrification]] [[endofunctor]] $Q$ of def. \ref{Spectrification}.

The _[[Bousfield-Friedlander theorem]]_ which we discuss now  states that if an [[endofunctor]] $Q \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ on a [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$ behaves like an [[idempotent monad]] in an appropriate model category theoretic sense, then the [[left Bousfield localization]] [[model category]] structure of $\mathcal{C}$ at the $Q$-equivalences exists.



+-- {: .num_defn #QuillenIdempotentMonad}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[proper model category]]. 
Say that a **Quillen idempotent monad** on $\mathcal{C}$ is
 
1. an [[endofunctor]] 

   $Q \;\colon\;  \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$

1. a [[natural transformation]]

   $\eta \colon id_{\mathcal{C}} \longrightarrow Q$

such that

1. $Q$ preserves weak equivalences;

1. all $Q(\eta_X) \colon Q(X) \longrightarrow Q(Q(X))$ are weak equivalences;

1. if in a [[pullback]] square in $\mathcal{C}$

   $$
     \array{
       f^\ast W &\stackrel{f^\ast h}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       W &\stackrel{h}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     }
   $$

   we have that

   1. $f$ is a fibration and $Y$ is fibrant;

   1. $Q(\eta_X)$, $Q(\eta_Y)$ and $Q(h)$ are weak equivalences

   then $Q(f^\ast h)$ is a weak equivalence.

###### Lemma

In the situation of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInBousfieldLocalizationAtQuillenIdempotentMonad}, 
a morphism is an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{C}_Q$ precisely if it is an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{C}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear from the definition that an acyclic fibration is also a  $Q$-acyclic $Q$-fibration. In the other direction, let $f$ be a $Q$-acyclic $Q$-fibration. Consider its factorization into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration

$$
  f \colon \underoverset{\in Cof}{i}{\longrightarrow} \underoverset{\in W \cap Fib}{p}{\longrightarrow}
  \,.
$$

Now the fact that $Q$ preserves weak equivalences together with [[two-out-of-three]] implies that $i$ is a $Q$-weak equivalence, hence a $Q$-acyclic $Q$-cofibration. This means by assumption that $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $i$. Hence the [[retract argument]], implies that $f$ is a [[retract]] of the acyclic fibration $p$, and so is itself an acyclic fibration.

###### Proposition
**([[Bousfield-Friedlander theorem]])**

For $Q \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$
a Quillen idempotent monad according to def. \ref{QuillenIdempotentMonad},
then $\mathcal{C}_Q$, def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInBousfieldLocalizationAtQuillenIdempotentMonad} is a [[model category]].

=--

([Bousfield-Friedlander 78, theorem 8.7](Bousfield-Friedlander+theorem#BousfieldFriedlander78), [Bousfield 01, theorem 9.3 ](Bousfield-Friedlander+theorem#Bousfield01))

Warning: this proof assumes that $\mathcal{C}$ admits [[functorial factorization]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[two-out-of-three]] poperty for $Q$-fibrations is evident. We discuss the two factorization conditions, from these the lifting follows by the [[retract argument]].

First, lemma \ref{FirstLemmaForBousfieldFriedlander} directly implies that every morphism factors as a $Q$-cofibration followed by a $Q$-acyclic $Q$-fibration, simply by factoring it as a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.

For the other factorization, let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism. By applying functorial fibrant replacement to $Q(f) \to \widehat{Q(f)}$ in $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}_{inj}$ and composing this with $\eta_f$ yields a diagram 

$$
  \array{
     X &\underoverset{}{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& Q(X) &\underoverset{W\cap Cof}{u}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(X)}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q(f)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{{\widehat{Q(f)} \atop {\in Fib}}}}
     \\
     Y &\underoverset{}{\eta_Y}{\longrightarrow}& Q(Y) &\underoverset{W\cap Cof}{v}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(Y)}
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $u$ is a weak equivalence, using the weak idempotency of $Q$ and [[two-out-of-three]] in the naturality square of $\eta$ on $u$ gives that $\eta_{\widehat{Q(X)}}$ is a weak equivalence. By the same argument $\eta_{\widehat{Q(Y)}}$ is a weak equivalence. From this, lemma \ref{SecondLemmaForBousfieldFriedlander} gives that $\widehat{Q(f)}$ is a $Q$-fibration.

Next, observe that the total bottom morphism $v \circ \eta_X$ is a $Q$-equivalence by the first two conditions on $Q$. Hence the third condition on $Q$ says that the pullback $\widehat{Q(f)}^\ast(v \circ \eta_X) \colon E \to \widehat{Q(X)}$ is also a $Q$-equivalence

$$
  \array{
     E &\underoverset{\in W_Q}{}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(X)}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g \atop {\in Fib_Q}}}\downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\widehat{Q(f)}}}
     \\
     Y &\underset{v \circ \eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(Y)}
  }
  \,.
$$

Then by [[two-out-of-three]] for $Q$-weak equivalences, the induced morphism $X \to E$ is a $Q$-weak equivalence, so by the previous factorization statement it factors as

$$
  X 
    \overset{W_Q \cap Cof_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
  D
    \stackrel{W_Q \cap Fib_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
  E
  \,.
$$

The resulting composite

$$
  f  
    \;\colon\;
    X 
      \overset{W_Q \cap Cof_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
    D
      \stackrel{W_Q \cap Fib_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
      \underoverset{g}{Fib_Q}{\longrightarrow}
    Y
$$

is the desired factorization.

### **1.2)** Structured spectra
 {#DiagramSpectra}


Given that [[spectra]] are the analog in [[homotopy theory]] of [[abelian groups]], we want to consider [[algebra]] -- the theory of [[rings]] and their [[modules]] -- [[internalization|internal]] to spectra. This "[[higher algebra]]" ([below](#HigherAlgebra)) accordingly is the theory of [[ring spectra]] and [[module spectra]].

[[!include homological and higher algebra -- table]]

Hence where a [[ring]] is equivalently a [[monoid]] with respect to the [[tensor product of abelian groups]], we are after a corresponding [[tensor product]] of [[spectra]]. This is to be the [[smash product of spectra]], induced by the [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]]/[[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]].


There is a key point to be dealt with here: the [[smash product of spectra]] has to exhibit a certain _graded commutativity_. Informally, there are two ways to see this:

First, we have seen above that under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] [[chain complexes]] yield examples of spectra. But the [[tensor product of chain complexes]] is graded commutative.

Second, more fundamentally, we see in the discussion of the [[Brown representability theorem]] ([here](#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem)) that every ([[sequential spectrum|sequential]]) [[spectrum]] $A$ induces a [[generalized homology theory]] given by the formula $X \mapsto \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$ (where the smash product is just the degreewise smash of pointed objects). By the [[suspension isomorphism]] this is such that for $X = S^n$ the [[n-sphere]], then $\pi_{\bullet\geq 0}(E \wedge S^n) \simeq \pi_{\bullet \geq 0}(E_n)$. This means that instead of thinking of a [[sequential spectrum]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum}, as indexed on the [[natural numbers]] equipped with [[addition]] $(\mathbb{N},+)$, it may be more natural to think of sequential spectra as indexed on the [[n-spheres]] equipped with their smash product of pointed spaces $(\{S^n\}_n, \wedge)$.

###### Proposition

There are [[homeomorphisms]] between [[n-spheres]] and their [[smash products]]

such that in [[Ho(Top)]] there are [[commuting diagrams]] like so:

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ realized as the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\phi_{n_1,n_2}$ is given by the identity on [[coordinates]] and the [[braiding]] homeomorphism

$$
  b_{n_1,n_2}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{S^2}
  \stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow}
  S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_2}
$$

is given by permuting the [[coordinates]]:

$$
  (x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1}, y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2})
  \mapsto
  (y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2}, x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1})
  \,.
$$

This has [[degree of a continuous map|degree]] $(-1)^{n_1 n_2}$ .

=--


This phenomenon suggests that if we "[[categorify]]" the [[natural numbers]] to the [[n-spheres]] and think of the $n$th component space of a [[sequential spectrum]] as being the value assigned to the [[n-sphere]]

$$
  E_n \simeq E(S^n)
$$

then there should be a possibly non-trivial [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on $E_n$, due to the fact that there is such an action of $S^n$ which is non-trivial according to prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}.

We discuss two ways of making this precise below in  _[Symmetric and orthogonal spectra](#SymmetricSpectra)_, and we discuss how these are unified by a concept of [[module objects]] over a [[monoid object]] representing the [[sphere spectrum]] below in _[S-modules](#SModules)_.

The general abstract theory for handling this is _[[monoidal category|monoidal]] and [[enriched category theory]]_. We first develop the relevant basics in _[Monoidal and enriched categories](#MonoidalAndEnrichedCategories)_


#### Symmetric and orthogonal spectra
 {#SymmetricSpectra}

**Literature.** ([Schwede 12](#Schwede12)) 

$\,$

In order to accomodate the graded commutativity phenomenon of spheres in prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}, we enrich the model of [[stable homotopy theory]] based on [[sequential spectra]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum}, by adding in [[mathematical structure|structure]] which captures the fact that the $n$th component $X_n$ of a sequential spectrum $X$ is to be thought of as the evaluation on the [[n-sphere]] and thus ought to be [[action|acted]] on by the [[automorphisms]] of the $n$-sphere. 

Taking into account just the automorphisms by [[coordinate]] [[permutations]] on $S^n \simeq (S^1)^{\wedge^n}$ yields the concept of _[[symmetric spectra]]_.
Taking into account the automorphisms by [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformations]] on $S^n \simeq (\mathbb{R}^n)^+$ yields the concept of _[[orthogonal spectra]]_. Using _all_ automorphisms yields the concept of _pre-[[excisive functors]]_.

To contrast these more structured models for spectra with the plain [[sequential spectra]], they are sometimes referred to as _[[highly structured spectra]]_.

Below in _[S-modules](#SModules)_ we give a unified discussion of all four models of spectra thus obtained (sequential, symmetric, orthogonal, excisive). Further below in _[The stable model structures](#TheStableModelStructures)_ we use this to construction and understand the [[model structures on spectra]] that present [[stable homotopy theory]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the explicit model of $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ as the category of fibrant-cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ with left/right-homotopy classes of morphisms between them (discussed at _[[homotopy category of a model category]]_).

A [[derived functor]] exists if its restriction to this subcategory preserves weak equivalences. Now the [[pushout-product axiom]] implies that on the subcategory of cofibrant objects the functor $\otimes$ preserves acyclic cofibrations, and then the preservation of all weak equivalences follows by [[Ken Brown's lemma]]. 

Hence $\otimes^L$ exists and its [[associativity]] follows simply by restriction. It remains to see its [[unitality]].

To that end, consider the construction of the localization functor $\gamma$ via a fixed but arbitrary choice of (co-)fibrant replacements $Q$ and $R$, assumed to be the identity on (co-)fibrant objects. We fix notation as follows:

$$

  \,.
$$

 
Now to see that $\gamma(I)$ is the [[tensor unit]] for $\otimes^L$, notice that in the [[zig-zag]]

$$
  (R Q I) \otimes (R Q X)
    \overset{j_{Q I} \otimes (R Q X)}{\longleftarrow}
  (Q I) \otimes (R Q X)
    \overset{(Q I)\otimes j_{Q X}}{\longleftarrow}
  (Q I) \otimes (Q X)
    \overset{p_I \otimes (Q X)}{\longrightarrow}
  I \otimes Q X
    \simeq
  Q X
$$

all morphisms are weak equivalences: For the first two this is due to the [[pushout-product axiom]], for the third this is due to the unit axiom on a monoidal model category. It follows that under $\gamma(-)$ this zig-zig gives an isomorphism

$$
  \gamma(I) \otimes^L \gamma(X)\simeq \gamma(X)
$$

and similarly for tensoring with $\gamma(I)$ from the right.

To exhibit lax monoidal structure on $\gamma$, we need to construct a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \gamma(X) \otimes^L \gamma(Y) \longrightarrow \gamma(X \otimes Y)
$$

and show that it satisfies the the appropriate [[associativity]] and [[unitality]] condition.

By the definitions at _[[homotopy category of a model category]]_, the morphism in question is to be of the form

$$
  (R Q X) \otimes (R Q Y) \longrightarrow R Q (X\otimes Y)
$$


To this end, consider the [[zig-zag]]

$$
  (R Q X) \otimes (R Q Y)
   \underoverset{\in Cof \cap W}{j_{Q X} \otimes R Q Y}{\longleftarrow}
  (Q X) \otimes (R Q Y)
    \underoverset{\in Cof \cap W}{(Q X) \otimes  j_{Q Y} }{\longleftarrow}
  (Q X) \otimes (Q Y)
    \overset{p_X \otimes (Q Y)}{\longrightarrow}
  X \otimes (Q Y)
    \overset{Y \otimes p_Y}{\longrightarrow}   
  X \otimes Y
  \,,
$$

and observe that the two morphisms on the left are weak equivalences, as indicated, by the [[pushout-product axiom]] satisfied by $\otimes$.

Hence applying $\gamma$ to this zig-zag, which is given by the two horizontal part of the following digram

$$
  \array{
    (R Q X) \otimes (R Q Y) &\longleftarrow& R( Q X \otimes Q Y ) &\longrightarrow& R Q (X \otimes Y)
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{id}} && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{j_{Q X \otimes Q Y}}} && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{j_{Q(X \otimes Y)}}}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{X\otimes Y}}}
    \\
    (R Q X) \otimes (R Q Y)
     &\underoverset{\in Cof \cap W}{j_{Q X} \otimes j_{Q Y}}{\longleftarrow}&
    (Q X) \otimes (Q Y)
      &\overset{p_X \otimes p_Y}{\longrightarrow}&
    X \otimes Y
  }
  \,,
$$

and inverting the first two morphisms, this yields a natural transformation as required. 


To see that this satisfies associativity if the monoid axiom holds, tensor the entire diagram above on the right with $(R Q Z)$ and consider the following [[pasting]] composite:

$$
  \array{
    (R Q X) \otimes (R Q Y) \otimes (R Q Z) &\longleftarrow& R( Q X \otimes Q Y ) \otimes (R Q Z) &\longrightarrow& (R Q (X \otimes Y)) \otimes (R Q Z)
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{id}} && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{j_{Q X \otimes Q Y} \otimes id }} && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{j_{Q(X \otimes Y)}\otimes id }}
    \\
    && && Q(X \otimes Y) \otimes (R Q Z) &\overset{id \otimes j_{Q Z}}{\longleftarrow}& Q(X\otimes Y) \otimes (Q Z)
    \\
       \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}} 
    && 
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{(X\otimes Y)} \otimes id }} 
    &(\star)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{(X \otimes Y)} \otimes id}}
    \\
    (R Q X) \otimes (R Q Y) \otimes (R Q Z)
     &\underoverset{\in Cof \cap W}{j_{Q X} \otimes j_{Q Y} \otimes id}{\longleftarrow}&
    (Q X) \otimes (Q Y) \otimes (R Q Z)
      &\overset{p_X \otimes p_Y \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    X \otimes Y \otimes (R Q Z)
      &\underset{id \otimes j_{Q Z}}{\longleftarrow}&
    X\otimes Y \otimes Q Z 
      &\overset{id \otimes p_Z}{\longrightarrow}& 
    X \otimes Y \otimes Z  
  }
  \,,
$$

Observe that under $\gamma$ the total top [[zig-zag]] in this diagram gives

$$
  (\gamma(X) \otimes^L \gamma(Y)) \otimes^L \gamma(Z)
  \to \gamma(X\otimes Y)\otimes^L \gamma(Z)
  \,.
$$

Now by the [[monoid axiom in a monoidal model category|monoid axiom]] (but not by the pushout-product axiom!), the horizontal maps in the square in the bottom right (labeled $\star$) are weak equivalences. This implies that the total horizontal part of the diagram is a [[zig-zag]] in the first place, and that under $\gamma$ the total top zig-zag is equal to the image of that total bottom zig-zag. But by functoriality of $\otimes$, that image of the bottom zig-zag is 

$$
  \gamma(p_X \otimes p_Y \otimes p_Z) 
  \circ 
  \gamma(j_{Q X} \otimes j_{Q Y} \otimes j_{Q Z})^{-1}
  \,.
$$

The same argument applies to left tensoring with $R Q Z$ instead of right tensoring, and so in both cases we reduce to the same morphism in the homotopy category, thus showing the associativity condition on the transformation that exhibits $\gamma$ as a lax monoidal functor.

1. pre-[[excisive functors]]

This approach is due to ([Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley 00](#MMSS00)).

###### Definition

Define the following $Top^{\ast/}$-[[enriched categories|enriched]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal categories]] (the [[tensor product]] is an [[enriched functor]]):

1. $Seq$ has as objects the [[natural numbers]] and has only identity morphisms, tensor product is the addition of natural numbers, tensor unit is 0;

1. $Sym$ is the standard [[skeletal category|skeleton]] of the [[core]] of [[FinSet]], objects are the sets $\{1, \cdots,n\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, all morphisms are [[automorphisms]] and the [[automorphism group]] of $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ is the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$, tensor product is the [[disjoint union]] of sets, tensor unit is the [[empty set]];

1. $Orth$ has as objects finite dimenional real linear [[inner product spaces]] $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ and as morphisms the [[linear map|linear]] [[isometry|isometric]] [[isomorphisms]] between these; hence all morphisms are [[automorphisms]] and the [[automorphism group]] of the object $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ is the [[orthogonal group]] $O(V)$; the monoidal product is [[direct sum]] of linear spaces, the tensor unit is the 0-vector space;

1. $Top_{fin}^{\ast/}$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[pointed topological space]] on those [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to [[finite CW-complexes]], tensor product is their [[smash product]], tensor unit is the [[0-sphere]] $S^0$.

Denote the canonical [[faithful functor|faithful]] [[subcategory]] inclusions by

$$
 \array{
   Seq 
     &\stackrel{seq}{\hookrightarrow}& 
   Sym

$$

where $S^V$ denotes the [[one-point compactification]] of $V$. On morphisms $sym \colon \Sigma_n \hookrightarrow O(n)$ is the inclusion of [[permutation]] matrices into [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] matrices and $orth \colon O(V) \hookrightarrow Aut(S^V)$ is the topological subspace inclusions of the pointed [[homeomorphisms]] $S^V \to S^V$ that are induced under forming [[one-point compactification]] from linear isometric isometries of $V$.

1. All three inclusions are [[strong monoidal functors]].

1. Under passing to [[enriched functor categories]], restriction $(-)^\ast$ along these inclusions and [[left Kan extension]] $(-)_!$ along them yields a sequence of [[adjunctions]]

1. All four [[enriched functor categories]] become [[symmetric monoidal categories]] with the [[Day convolution]] monoidal product structure induced by the monoidal structure of their [[sites]]. 

1. With respect to this all [[adjunctions]] above are symmetric [[monoidal adjunctions]] (the [[right adjoint]] is a [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric]] [[lax monoidal functor]], the [[left adjoint]] is even a [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric]] [[strong monoidal functor]]).

for the image under the [[Yoneda embedding]] of the [[tensor unit]] in $Top_{fin}^{\ast/}$ with its [[smash product]] (the [[0-sphere]]), which by lemma \ref{DayConvolutionTensorUnitIsYonedaImageOfTensorUnitInSite} is the tensor unit in $([Top_{fin}^{\ast/}, Top^{\ast/}], \otimes_{Day})$.

Since this is going to be the standard presentation of the [[sphere spectrum]] in the [[model structure for excisive functors]] on $[Top_{fin}^{\ast/}, Top^{\ast/}]$ we refer to it as _[[generalized the|the]] [[sphere spectrum]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark #RestrictionsOfSphereSpectrumAreStillMonoidObjects}
###### Remark

While $\mathbb{S}$ in def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum} is the [[tensor unit]] in $([Top_{fin}^{\ast/}, Top^{\ast/}], \otimes_{Day})$, neither of its restrictions $\mathbb{S}_{Orth},\mathbb{S}_{Sym}, \mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ is the tensor unit in $([Orth, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day}), ([Sym, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day}), ([Seq, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day})$, respectively. 

Nevertheless, because by prop. \ref{PropertiesOfTopologicalDiagramCategoriesForSpectra} the restriction functors are [[strong monoidal functors]] and because the tensor unit $\mathbb{S}$ canonically has the structure of a [[monoid object]], each of $\mathbb{S}_{Orth},\mathbb{S}_{Sym}, \mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ inherts the structure of a [[monoid object]] in the respective [[Day convolution]] [[monoidal category]].

Moreover, $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ are [[commutative monoid objects]], while $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ is not commutative (due to the [graded commutativity in the smash product of spheres](smash+product+of+spectra#GradedCommutativity) which is not reflected in the trivial symmetry of the tensor product on $Seq$).

| | $\mathbb{S}$ | $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ | $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ | $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ |
|--|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| [[monoid object]] | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| [[commutative monoid object]] | yes | yes | yes | no |
| [[tensor unit]] | yes | no | no | no |

Explicitly, by the discussion at _[Day convolutions -- Properties -- Monoids](Day+convolution#Monoids)_, monoids with resepct to Day convolution are equivalently [[lax monoidal functors]] on the site, and as such $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ is the one given by the canonical [[natural transformations]]

$$
  S^{V_1} \wedge S^{V_2} \longrightarrow S^{V_1 \oplus V_2}
$$

and $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ the ones given by the canonical natural transformations

$$
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2} \longrightarrow S^{n_1 + n_2}

Therefore we may consider [[module objects]] over the restrictions of [[generalized the|the]] [[sphere spectrum]] from def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum}.

###### Proposition

The category of right [[module objects]] over $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$, $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ from def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum}, which are [[monoid objects]] by prop. \ref{PropertiesOfTopologicalDiagramCategoriesForSpectra}, remark \ref{RestrictionsOfSphereSpectrumAreStillMonoidObjects}, are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], respectively, to the categories of [[orthogonal spectra]], [[symmetric spectra]] and [[sequential spectra]] (in [[compactly generated topological spaces]]):

$$

$$
  \mathbb{S}_{Seq} Mod_r \simeq SeqSpec(Top)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$ for any of the three monoids. By the discussion at _[Day convolutions -- Properties -- Monoids](Day+convolution#Monoids)_, right modules with respect to [[Day convolution]] are equivalently right [[modules over monoidal functors]] over the monoidal functor corresponding to $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$ as in remark \ref{RestrictionsOfSphereSpectrumAreStillMonoidObjects}. This means that for $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ they are functors $X \colon Sym \longrightarrow sSet^{\ast/}$ or $X \colon Seq \longrightarrow sSet^{\ast/}$, respectively equipped with [[natural transformations]]

$$
  X_p \wedge S^{q}  \longrightarrow X_{p+q}
$$

satisfying the evident [[categorification|categorified]] [[action]] property. In the present case this action property says that these morphisms are determined by 

$$
  X_p \wedge S^1 \longrightarrow X_{p+1}
$$

under the isomorphisms $S^p \simeq S^1 \wedge S^{p-1}$. Naturality of all these morphisms as functors on $Sym$ is the equivariance under the symmetric group actions in the definition of [[symmetric spectra]]. 

Similarly, modules over $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ are equivalently functors

$$
  X_V \wedge S^{W}  \longrightarrow X_{V \oplus W}
$$

etc. and their functoriality embodies the [[orthogonal group]]-equivariance in the definition of [[orthogonal spectra]].


=--

+-- {: .num_remark #PreExcisiveFunctorsAreSModules}
###### Remark

For completeness, we may, trivially, add to the three statements in prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules} the equivalence

$$
  \mathbb{S} Mod_r \simeq [Top^{\ast/}_{fin}, Top^{\ast/}]
  \,,
$$

which holds tautologically because by def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum} $\mathbb{S}$ is in fact the [[tensor unit]] in $([Top^{\ast/}_{fin}, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day})$, so that every object here is canonically a module object over $\mathbb{S}$.

Now the [[model structure on excisive functors]] shows that the category $[Top^{\ast/}_{fin}, Top^{\ast/}]$ constitutes a model for [[stable homotopy theory]], while this is not the case for either of its restrictions. 

Hence we may read prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules} as saying that while restricting the domain of [[excisive functors]] breaks their property of being a model for [[stable homotopy theory]], but at the same time retaining the correspondingly restricted [[sphere spectrum]]-[[module]] structure first of all becomes non-tautological after restriction and second restores the property of the objects to model spectra.

Via prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules} this is equivalently symmetric monoidal product structure

1. If $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$ is a [[commutative monoid]] (hence for $dia \in \{Top^\ast/, Orth,Sym\}$ but not for $dia = Seq$) then $\mathbb{S}_{dia} FreeMod^{op}$ carries a [[symmetric monoidal category]] structure such that under the above equivalence its [[Day convolution]] is the [[tensor product of modules]].

We consider now, prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra} below, "strict" [[model category]] structures on the above categories of spectra, which regard spectra only as diagrams of topological spaces, ignoring the fact that it is not the degreewise [[homotopy groups]] but the [[stable homotopy groups]] that are to be invariants of [[stable homotopy types]] (this is def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} below with an extra subtlety in the case of symmetric spectra, see prop. \ref{RelationBetweenStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} below). Incorporating the latter is accomplished by a [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localizatiob]] of the strict model structures to the genuine stable model structures [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructure).

###### Proposition

Write $[Seq, Top^{\ast/}_{Quillen}]$ for the [[model category]] structure on $\mathbb{N}$-parameterized sequences of pointed topological spaces, whose weak equivalences, fibrations and cofibrations are degreewise those of the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]]. (This is equivalently the injective as well as the  projective [[model structure on functors]] over the discrete category $\mathbb{N}$).

Then for each of the categories in the diagram of prop. \ref{SystemOfAdjunctionsForDiagramSpectra}, say that the **strict model structure** on it is the [[transferred model structure]] from $[Seq, Top^{\ast/}_{Quillen}]$ along the composite adjunction connecting the two in that diagram, so that we get a diagram of [[Quillen adjunctions]]

To see that indeed all the adjunctions here are [[Quillen adjunctions]], use that by prop. \ref{PropertiesOfTopologicalDiagramCategoriesForSpectra} and lemma \ref{SModulesAsEnrichedFunctors} all [[right adjoints]] are given by restrictions of [[sites]]. By definition of the strict model structures and transferred moddel structures their fibrations and acyclic fibrations are objectwise so, and hence are preserved by these restriction functors.

To obtain from this the genuine [[stable homotopy theory]] of genuine spectra we need to restrict this to [[Omega-spectra]], in the following sense.

+-- {: .num_defn #StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra}
###### Definition

For any of the four categories of spectra in prop. \ref{SystemOfAdjunctionsForDiagramSpectra}, we say (with notation from def. \ref{NotationForGenericDiagramSpectra}) that:

1. an object $X$ is an _Omega-spectrum_ if $seq^\ast X $ is an [[Omega spectrum]] in the standard sense of [[sequential spectra]];

1. a morphism $f$ is a _stable weak homotopy equivalence_ if $seq^\ast(f)$ is a [[stable weak homotopy equivalence]] in the standard sense of [[sequential spectra]] (an [[isomorphism]] on all [[stable homotopy groups]] of sequential spectra);

1. a morphism $f$ is a _stable equivalence_ if for all Omega-spectra $X$ in the above sense, the morphism $[f,E]_{strict}$ is a [[bijection]] (where $[-,E]_{strict}$ is the [[hom-functor]] of the [[homotopy category]] of the strict model structure of prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}.


=--

([MMSS00, def. 8.3 with the notation from p. 21](#MMSS00))


The following proposition says that def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} makes sense, in that if the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the strict model structures at the stable equivalences exists (which we check [below](ProofOfTheStableModelStructure)) then it indeed localizes the homotopy theory to the [[Omega-spectra]].

+-- {: .num_prop #StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences}
###### Proposition

The weak equivalences in the strict model structure (prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}) and the stable equivalences of def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} are related as follows:

1. Every weak equivalence with respect to the strict model structure is a stable equivalence.

1. Every stable equivalence between Omega-spectra (def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra}) is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

=--

([MMSS 00, lemma 8.11](#MMSS00))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement follows by def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} since weak equivalences become isomorphisms in the [[homotopy category]].

For the second statement, let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a stable equivalence between Omega-spectra. Then by definition, in particular

$$
  [f,X]_{strict} \;\colon\; [Y,X]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,X]_{strict}
$$

is a [[bijection]]. Therefore the pre-image of $[id_X] \in [X,X]_{strict}$ is an inverse to $f$ in the [[homotopy category]] of the strict model structure. Hence $f$ represents an isomorphism in the strict homotopy category and is hence a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

##### Free spectra
 {#FreeSpectra}

> This is a technical section with discussion of certain [[free construction|free]] objects  in the categories of spectra of prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules}. The discussion here provides technical lemmas that are used in the proof of the stable model structures [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructure), the proof of the Quillen equivalences between them [further below](#QuillenEquivalencesOfStableModelStructures) and [then](#MonoidalStableModelStructure) the proof that the model structure is monoidal.

The concept of _[[free spectrum]]_ is a generalization of that of _[[suspension spectrum]]_. In fact the [[stable homotopy types]] of free spectra are precisely those of iterated [[loop space objects]] of [[suspension spectra]]. But for the development of the theory what matters is free spectra before passing to stable homotopy types, for as such they play the role of the basic cells for the stable [[model structures on spectra]] analogous to the role of the [[n-spheres]] in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] (def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra} below).

Moreover, while free [[sequential spectra]] are just re-indexed [[suspension spectra]], free [[symmetric spectra]] and free [[orthogonal spectra]] in addition come with suitably freely generated [[actions]] of the [[symmetric group]] and the [[orthogonal group]]. It turns out that this is not entirely trivial; it leads to a subtle issue (lemma \ref{AdjunctsOfFreeSpectrumInclusionsAreOrAreNotStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences} below) where the [[adjuncts]] of certain canonical inclusions of free spectra are [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] for sequential and orthogonal spectra, but _not_ for symmetric spectra.  The fine analysis of this phenomenon is crucial in the proof of the [[Quillen equivalences]] between the stable model structures on the four models of spectra (theorem \ref{QuillenEquivalencesBetweenStableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra}).

   $$

1. On the free $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$-module on $e \in Dia^{op} \stackrel{y}{\hookrightarrow} [Dia, Top^{\ast/}]$ this takes the value

  $$
    (F^{dia}_n K)(e)

    \,.
  $$

=--

([MMSS00, p. 7 with theorem 2.2](#MMSS00))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Generally, for $\mathcal{C}$ a $V$-[[enriched category|enriched]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], and for $c\in \mathcal{C}$ an object, then there is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  [\mathcal{C}, V]
    \stackrel{\overset{y(d)\otimes(-)}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{(-)_c}{\longrightarrow}}
  V
$$

whose characterizing [[natural isomorphism]] is the combination of that of [[tensoring]] with the [[Yoneda embedding]]:

$$
  [\mathcal{C},V]( y(d) \otimes K, F )
    \simeq
  V( K, [\mathcal{C},V]( y(d), F ) )
    \simeq
  V(K, F(d))
  \,.
$$ 

Specializing this to our case with $V = Top^{\ast/}$ and $\mathcal{C} = \mathbb{S}_{dia} FreeMod^{op}$ yields the first statement. The second follows from similar yoga, see the formula at _[Day convolution -- Modules](Day+convolution#FreeModulesOverAMonoidInDayConvolution)_.

+-- {: .num_prop #ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}
###### Proposition

Explicitly, the [[free spectra]] according to def. \ref{FreeStructuredSpectrum}, look as follows:

For [[sequential spectra]]: $(F^{Seq}_n K)_q \simeq K \wedge S^{q-n}$;

for [[symmetric spectra]]: $(F^{Sym}_n K)_q \simeq \Sigma(q)_+ \wedge_{\Sigma(q-n)} K \wedge S^{q-n}$.

for [[orthogonal spectra]]: $(F^{Orth}_n K)_q \simeq O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n)} K \wedge S^{q-n}$.

In particular: 

1. $F_0 K = \Sigma^\infty K$;

1. $F_n^{Seq}S^n$ is like the [[suspension spectrum]] of the point (the standard sequential [[sphere spectrum]]) but with its first $n$ components simply removed.


=--

(e.g. [Schwede 12, example 3.20](#Schwede12))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By working out the formula in item 2 of lemma \ref{ExplicitExpressionForFreeSpectra}. In the sequential case $(Dia = Seq)$ there exists a morphism $k_1 \otimes k_2 \to k_3$ only if $k_1 + k_2 = k_3$ and then there is a unique such. Hence here the colimit in the formula becomes a [[coproduct]] and we find

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (F^{Seq}_n K)(q)
      & \simeq
    \underset{e_1+e_2 = q}{\coprod} 
    \underset{\simeq\left\{ \array{S^0 & if\, n = e_1 \\ \ast & otherwise}\right.}{\underbrace{Seq(n,e_1)}} \wedge \mathbb{S}_{dia}(e_2) \wedge K
    \\
     & \simeq
      S^{q-n}\wedge K
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

In the symmetric case ($Dia = Sym$) the formula is similar except that $S^0 = Seq(q,q)_+$ is replaced by $Sym(q,q)_+ = \Sigma(q)_+$ and the colimit goes over the automorphisms that fix $q-n$ elements, thereby producing the partial smash tensor shown in the statement. Analogously for the orthogonal case ($Dia = Orth$).

=--

One use of free spectra, important in the verification of the stable model structures [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructure) and in the dicussion of the stable equivalences [further below](#RelatingStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences), is that they serve to co-represent adjuncts of structure morphisms of spectra. To this end, first consider the following general existence statement.

+-- {: .num_lemma #CorepresentingOfAdjunctsOfStructureMapsExists}
###### Lemma

$$
  \lambda_n

  F_{n+1}^{dia}S^1
    \longrightarrow
  F_n^{dia} S^0
$$

such that for every $X\in \mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod$ precomposition $\lambda_n^\ast$ forms a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$

    \mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod(F^{dia}_n S^0, X) &\simeq& Top^{\ast/}(S^0,X_n) &\simeq& X_n

    Top^{\ast/}(S^1, X_{n+1})
    &\simeq&
    \Omega X_{n+1}
  }
  \,,
$$

where the horizontal equivalences are the [[adjunction]] isomorphisms and the canonical identification, and where the right morphism is the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunct]] of the structure map $\sigma_n$ of the [[sequential spectrum]] $seq^\ast X$ underlying $X$ (def. \ref{NotationForGenericDiagramSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all prescribed morphisms in the diagram are [[natural transformations]], this is in fact a diagram of copreheaves on $\mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod(F^{dia}_n S^0, -) &\simeq& Top^{\ast/}(S^0,(-)_n) &\simeq& (-)_n

    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde \sigma^{(-)}_n}}

    \mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod(F^{dia}_{n+1} S^1, -)
    &\simeq&
    Top^{\ast/}(S^1, (-)_{n+1})
    &\simeq&
    \Omega (-)_{n+1}

([MMSS 00, lemma 8.5](#MMSS00), following [Hovey-Shipley-Smith 00, remark 2.2.12](#HoveyShipleySmith00))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the case $Dia = Seq$ and $n = 0$. All other cases work analogously.

By lemma \ref{ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}, in this case the morphism $\lambda_0$ has components like so:

$$
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    S^3 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^3
    \\
    S^2 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^2
    \\
    S^1 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    \ast &\stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow}& S^0
    \\
    \underbrace{\,\,\,} && \underbrace{\,\,\,}
    \\
    F_1 S^1 &\stackrel{\lambda_0}{\longrightarrow}& F_0 S^0
  }
  \,.
$$

Now for $X$ any sequential spectrum, then a morphism $f \colon F_0 S^0 \to X$ is uniquely determined by its 0th components $f_0 \colon S^0 \to X_0$ (that's of course the very free property of $F_0 S^0$); as the compatibility with the structure maps forces the first component, in particular, to be $\sigma_0^X\circ \Sigma f$:

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma S^0 &\stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma X_0
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_0^X}}
    \\
    S^1 &\stackrel{\sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& X_1
  }
$$

But that first component is just the component that similarly determines the precompositon of $f$ with $\lambda_0$, hence $\lambda_0^\ast f$ is fully fixed as being the map $\sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f$. Therefore $\lambda_0^\ast$ is the function

$$
  \lambda_0^\ast
  \;\colon\;
  X_0 
  = 
  Maps(S^0, X_0)
  \stackrel{f \mapsto \sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}
  \Maps(S^1, X_1)
  =
  \Omega X_1
  \,.
$$

It remains to see that this is the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunct]] of $\sigma_0^X$. By the general formula for adjuncts, this is

$$
  \tilde \sigma_0^X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X_0 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
  \Omega \Sigma X_0
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega X_1
  \,.
$$

To compare to the above, we check what this does on points: $S^0 \stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow} X_0$ is sent to the composite

$$
   S^0 
     \stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow}
   X_0 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
   \Omega \Sigma X_0
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow}
   \Omega X_1
   \,.
$$

To identify this as a map $S^1 \to X_1$ we use the adjunction isomorphism once more to throw all the $\Omega$-s on the right back to $\Sigma$-s the left, to finally find that this is indeed

$$
  \sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f
    \;\colon\;
  S^1 = \Sigma S^0 \stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma X_0 \stackrel{\sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow} X_1
  \,.

The following property of the maps from def. \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctsOfStructureMaps} to be or not to be stable weak homotopy equivalences will be the key technical fact that implies ([below](#RelatingStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences)) that stable equivalences of spectra are or are not the same as stable weak homotopy equivalences.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement is an immediate consequence of lemma \ref{IndeedCorepresentationOfAdjunctsOfStructureMaps}.

The other two statements follow from inspection of the explicit form of the maps, via prop. \ref{ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}, in each case separately:

**sequential case**

Here the components of the morphism eventually stabilize to isomorphisms

$$
  \array{
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_{n+3} & S^3 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^3
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_{n+2} & S^2 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^2
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_{n+1} & S^1 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_n \colon & \ast &\stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow}& S^0
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \underbrace{\,\,\,} && \underbrace{\,\,\,}
    \\
    \lambda_n \colon & F_{n+1} S^1 &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& F_n S^0
  }
$$

and this immediately gives that $\lambda_n$ is an isomorphism on stable homotopy groups.

**orthogonal case**

Here for $q \geq n+1$ the $q$-component of $\lambda_n$ is the [[quotient]] map

$$
  (\lambda_n)_q 
    \;\colon\;
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n-1)} S^{q-n}
   \simeq
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n-1)} S^1 \wedge S^{q-n-1}
  \longrightarrow
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n)}S^{q-n}
  \,.
$$

By the [suspension isomorphism](homotopy+group+of+a+spectrum#SuspensionIsomorphismOfStableHomotopyGroups) for [[stable homotopy groups]], $\lambda_n$ is a stable weak homotopy equivalence precisely if any of its [[reduced suspension|suspensions]] is. Hence consider instead $\Sigma^n \lambda_n \coloneqq S^n \wedge \lambda_n$, whose $q$-component is 

$$
  (\Sigma^n\lambda_n)_q 
    \;\colon\;
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n-1)} S^{q}
    \longrightarrow
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n)}S^{q}
  \,.
$$

Now due to the fact that $O(q-k)$-action on $S^q$ lifts to an $O(q)$-action, the quotients of the diagonal action of $O(q-k)$ equivalently become quotients of just the left action. Formally this is due to the existence of the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    O(q)_+ \wedge S^q 
     &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& 
    O(q)_+ \wedge S^q 
     &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& 
    O(q)_+ \wedge S^q 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\

  }
$$

which says that the image of any $(g,s) \in O(q)_+  \wedge S^q$ in the quotient $Q(q)_+ \wedge_{Q(q-k)} S^q$ is labeled by $([g],s)$.

It follows that $(\Sigma^n\lambda_n)_q$ is the smash product of a projection map of [[coset spaces]] with the identity on the sphere:

$$
  (\Sigma^n\lambda_n)_q 
    \simeq
  proj_+ \wedge id_{S^q} 
    \;\colon\;
  O(q)/O(q-n-1)_+ \wedge S^q
    \longrightarrow
  O(q)/O(q-n)_+ \wedge S^{q}
  \,.
$$

Now finally observe that this projection function

$$
  proj
  \;\colon\;
  O(q)/O(q-n-1) 
    \longrightarrow
  O(q)/O(q-n)
$$

is $(q - n -1 )$-connected (see [here](coset+space#CofiberSequencesOfCosetsOfOrthogonalGroups)). Hence its smash product with $S^q$ is $(2q - n -1 )$-connected.

The key here is the fast growth of the connectivity with $q$. This implies that for each $s$ there exists $q$ such that $\pi_{s+q}((\Sigma^n \lambda_n)_q)$ becomes an isomorphism. Hence $\Sigma^n \lambda_n$ is a stable weak homotopy equivalence and therefore so is $\lambda_n$.

**symmetric case**
 
Here the morphism $\lambda_n$ has the same form as in the orthogonal case above, except that all occurences of [[orthogonal groups]] are replaced by just their sub-[[symmetric groups]].

Accordingly, the analysis then proceeds entirely analogously, with the key difference that the projection

$$
  \Sigma(q)/\Sigma(q-n-1) 
    \longrightarrow
  \Sigma(q)/\Sigma(q-n)
$$

does _not_ become highly connected as $q$ increases, due to the [[discrete topological space]] underlying the symmetric group. Accordingly the conclusion now is the opposite: $\lambda_n$ is not a stable weak homotopy equivalence in this case.

Another use of free spectra is that their [[pushout products]] may be explicitly analyzed, and checking the [[pushout-product axiom]] for general cofibrations may be reduced to checking it on morphisms between free spectra.

##### Stable equivalences

We discuss that the two concepts of _stable equivalences_ and of _stable weak homotopy equivalences_ in def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} actually agree in the cases of a) pre-[[excisive functors]], b) [[orthogonal spectra]] and c) [[sequential spectra]], while in the case of [[symmetric spectra]] the class of stable equivalences includes but is strictly larger than that of stable weak homotopy equivalences. 

This is important in practice, since the stable equivalences are the weakequivalences in the stable model structure of theorem \ref{StableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra}, while the [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] are typically more readily identified.

###### Proof

Let $E$ be an Omega-spectrum. Then by the first item of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAKindOfAlmostSpectrification}, for every $X$ the morphism

$$
  [X,r_E]_{strict}
    \;\colon\; 
  [X,E]_{strict} 
    \longrightarrow 
  [X, R^\infty E]_{strict}

is an isomorphism. Since $r_{(-)}$ is a [[natural transformation]] (by def. \ref{AKindOfAlmostSpectrification}), the naturality squares gives a factorization of this morphism as

$$
  [X,r_E]_{strict}
    \;\colon\;
  [X,E]_{strict} 
    \stackrel{R^\infty}{\longrightarrow}
  [R^\infty X, R^\infty E]_{strict}
    \stackrel{[r_X,E]_{strict}}{\longrightarrow}
  [X, R^\infty E]_{strict}  
$$

Combining this with vertical morphisms as below, which are isomorphisms again by item 1 of lemma \ref{AKindOfAlmostSpectrification},

$$
  \array{

exhibits a [[retraction]] 

$$
  id \colon [X,E]_{strict} \longrightarrow [R^\infty X,E]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,E]_{strict}

$$ 

which is natural in $X$. This naturality now implies a retraction of morphisms

$$
  \array{
    id_{[Y,E]_{strict}} \colon & [Y,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [R^\infty Y,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [Y,E]_{strict}

Finally, by the second item of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAKindOfAlmostSpectrification}, the middle vertical morphism here is an isomorphism, hence $[f^\ast, E]_{strict}$ is the retract of an iso and hence ([here](retract#RetractOfIso)) an isomorphism itself, for all Omega-spectra $E$. This means by definition that $f^\ast$ is a stable equivalence.

By theorem ref. \ref{StableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra}, and by lemmas  \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} and \ref{RetractsOfRelativeKCellComplexesAreTheStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations}, every stable weak equivalence factors as a $K$-[[relative cell complex]] followed by weak equivalence in the strict model structure. Since the latter is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] it is in particular a [[stable weak homotopy equivalence]]. Hence we are reduced to showing that every $K$-[[relative cell complex]] is a stable weak homotopy equivalence.

Observe now that we know this to be true for the elements of $K$ itself (def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}): first of all, the elements in $F J$ are [[retracts]] of [[deformation retracts]] and therefore stable weak homotopy equivalences. Second, the morphisms denoted $k_n$ in def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}, which resolve the maps $\lambda_n$ from def. \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctsOfStructureMaps}, as stable weak homotopy equivalences by lemma \ref{AdjunctsOfFreeSpectrumInclusionsAreOrAreNotStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences}.  This implies that so are their pushout products $k_n \Box i$.

Explicitly, there is a model structure $\mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod_{stable}$ whose

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

First regarding strict cofibrations: By the [[Yoneda lemma]], the elements in $F J$ have [[right lifting property]] against the strict fibrations, hence in particular they are strict cofibrations. Moreover, by [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]], $k_n \Box i_+$ has left lifting against any acyclic strict fibration $f$ precisely if $k_n$ has left lifting against $f^i$. By $\mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod_{strict}$ being a $Top$-[[enriched model category]] the latter is still a strict acyclic fibration. Since $k_n$ by construction is a strict cofibration, the lifting follows and hence also $k_n \Box i_+$ is a strict cofibration.

Regarding stable equivalences: The morphisms in $F J$ by design are strict weak equivalences, hence they are in particular stable equivalences. Similarly, the morphisms $k_n$ by construction, by [[two-out-of-three]] and by remark \ref{CorepresentingForAdjunctOfStructureMapsAreStableEquivalences} are stable equivalences. Hence the derived hom (...expand...) out of $k_n \Box i_+$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence, hence on the homotopy category an iso.

A morphism in $\mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod$ which is both

1. a $K$-[[injective morphisms]] (with respect to $K$ from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}) 

is an acyclic fibration in the stric model structure, prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}, hence is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] and [[Serre fibration]] of topological spaces;

=--

([MMSS 00, corollary 9.8](#MMSS00))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $f\colon E \to B$ be both a stable equivalence as well as a $K$-injective morphism. Since $K$ contains the generating acyclic cofibrations for the strict model structure (prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}), $f$ is in particular a strict fibration, hence a degreewise fibration. Therefore the fiber $F$ of $f$ is its [[homotopy fiber]] in the strict model structure. This implies that for any $E$ that with $[f,E]_{strict}$ a bijection, by assumption also $[\ast,E]_{strict} \to [F,E]_{strict}$ is a bijection, hence that $F\to \ast$ is also a stable weak equivalence. 

Observe also that $F$, being the pullback of a $K$-injective morphisms is a $K$-[[injective object]], so that by corollary \ref{KInjectivesObjectsAreOmegaSpectra} $F$ is an Omega-spectrum. Together this implies with prop. \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences} that $F \to \ast$ is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure, hence degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. From this the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] imply that $\pi_{\bullet \geq 1}(f_n)$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] for all $n$ and for each homotopy group in positive degree. 

To infer from this the remaining case that also $\pi_0(f_0)$ is an isomorphism, observe that by assumption of $K$-injectivity lemma \ref{KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations} gives that $f_n$ is a homotopy pullback (in topological spaces) of $\Omega (f_{n+1})$. But by the above $\Omega (f_{n+1})$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, since $\pi_\bullet(\Omega(-)) = \pi_{\bullet+1}(-)$.

For $K$ from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}  the [[retracts]] of $K$-[[relative cell complexes]] are precisely the morphisms which are

1. stable equivalences (def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra}), 

1. as well as a cofibration with respect to the strict model structure (prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}).

=--

([MMSS 00, prop. 9.9 (i)](#MMSS00))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all elements of $K$ are stable equivalences and strict cofibrations by lemma \ref{ElementsOfKAreStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations}, it follows that every retract of relative $K$-cell complex has the same property.

In the other direction, if $f$ is a stable equivalence and strict cofibration, by the [[small object argument]] it factors $f \colon \stackrel{i}{\to}\stackrel{p}{\to}$ as a relative $K$-cell complex $i$ followed by a $K$-[[injective morphism]] $p$. By the previous statement $i$ is a stable equivalence, and so by assumption and by [[two-out-of-three]] so is $p$. Therefore lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} implies that $p$ is a strict acyclic fibration. But then the assumption that $f$ is a strict cofibration mean that it has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, and so the [[retract argument]] implies that $f$ is a retract of the relative $K$-cell complex $i$.

Every acyclic fibration in the strict model structure in injective with respect to to strict cofibrations by the strict model structure; and it is a stable equivalence by item 1 of prop. \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences}.

Conversely, a morphism injective with respect to stricts cofibrations that are stable equivalences is a $K$-[[injective morphism]] by corollary \ref{KInjectivesAreIndeedTheStableFibrations}, and hence if it is also a stable equivalence then by lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} it is a strict acylic fibration.

(of theorem \ref{StableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra})

The non-trivial points to check are the two [[weak factorization systems]].

That $(cof_{stable}\cap weq_{stable} \;,\; fib_{stable})$ is a weak factorization system follows from lemma \ref{RetractsOfRelativeKCellComplexesAreTheStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations} and the [[small object argument]]. 

By lemma \ref{StableAcyclicFibrationsAreEquivalentlyStrictAcyclicFibrations} the stable acyclic fibrations are equivalently the strict acyclic fibrations and hence the weak factorization system $(cof_{stable} \;,\; fib_{stable} \cap we_{stable})$ is identified with that of the strict model structure $(cof_{strict} \;,\; fib_{strict} \cap we_{strict})$.

Moreover by lemma \ref{StableAcyclicFibrationsAreEquivalentlyStrictAcyclicFibrations} the stable acyclic fibrations are equivalently the strict acyclic fibrations, which are of course also preserved by right Quillen functors for the strict model structure.

###### Proof idea
(of theorem \ref{QuillenEquivalencesBetweenStableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra})

With lemma \ref{AdjunctionsBetweenDiagramSpectraAreStableQuillenAdjunctions} it is sufficient to show that all the total [[derived functors]] are [[adjoint equivalences]]. By [[two-out-of-three]] for Quillen equivalences, it is sufficient to show this for all the (composite) adjunctions whose right adjoint does _not_ point to $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}Mod$.

In these cases, theorem \ref{RelationBetweenStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} implies that the right adjoint functor preserves and reflects weak equivalence (a morphism in its domain is a stable equivalence precisely if its image is).

In such a case, for checking a Quillen equivalence it is sufficient to check that the [[adjunction unit]] is a weak equivalence on all cofibrant objects (...citation...).

###### Lemma

The [[pushout product]] of two cofibrations in $\mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod_{stable}$ is again a cofibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A general abstract fact about [[pushout-products]] ([Hovey-Shipley-Smith 00, prop. 5.3.4](#HoveyShipleySmith00), see _[here](pushout-product#PushoutProductOfCofClassIsCofClassOfPushoutProduct)_) is that for $I_1, I_2$ two classes of morphisms in a [[symmetric monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] with [[finite limits]] and [[finite colimits]], and writing $I_i Cof$ for their saturated classes, then under [[pushout-product]] $\Box$:

$$
  (I_1 Cof) \Box (I_2 Cof)
  \subset 
  (I_1 \Box I_2) Cof
  \,.
$$

Since the cofibrations of the stable model structure, theorem \ref{StableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra}, are elements in


$$
  Cof_{stable} = (F I) Cof
$$

with $F I$ the class of [[free spectra]] on the class of generating cofibrations $I$ of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}, this implies in the present case that 

$$
  Cof_{stable} \Box Cof_{stable}
  \subset
  (F I \Box F I) Cof
  \,.
$$

Now lemma \ref{PushoutSmashProductOfFreeSpectraOnGeneratingCofibrationsOfTop} implies that 

$$
  F I \Box F I
  =
  F(I \Box I)
  =
  F I

While this gives detailed proofs, some standard steps used are made more explicit for instance in 

* {#Switzer75} [[Robert Switzer]], _Algebraic Topology - Homotopy and Homology_, Die  Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften in Einzeldarstellungen, Vol. 212, Springer-Verlag, New York, N. Y., 1975. 


Specifically for **S.1) Generalized cohomology** a neat account is in:

* {#AguilarGitlerPrieto02} Marcelo Aguilar, [[Samuel Gitler]], Carlos Prieto, section 12 of _Algebraic topology from a homotopical viewpoint_, Springer (2002) ([toc pdf](http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/106999419.pdf))


For **S.2) Cobordism theory** an efficient collection of the highlights is in

* {#Malkiewich11} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _Unoriented cobordism and $M O$_, 2011 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/cobordism.pdf))

except that it omits proof of the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]/[[Serre spectral sequence]] and that of the [[Thom isomorphism]], but see the references there and see ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96), [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 11.7](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)) for details.
 
For **S.3) Complex oriented cohomology** besides ([Kochman 96, chapter 4](#Kochman96)) have a look at part II of 

* {#Adams74} [[Frank Adams]], _[[Stable homotopy and generalized homology]]_, Chicago Lectures in mathematics, 1974

and

* {#Lurie10} [[Jacob Lurie]], lectures 1-10 of _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010

(These overlap, pick the one that seems more inviting on first reading.)

### Further reading

The two originals

* {#Quillen67} [[Daniel Quillen]], _Axiomatic homotopy theory_ in  _Homotopical algebra_, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, No. 43 43, Berlin (1967)

* {#Brown73} [[Kenneth Brown]], _[[Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology]]_, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 186 (1973), 419-458  ([JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1996573))

are still an excellent source. For further reading on homotopy theory and stable homotopy theory a useful collection is

* {#James95} [[Ioan Mackenzie James]], _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_ 1995

The modern chromatic picture originates around

* {#Hopkins99} [[Mike Hopkins]], _[[Complex oriented cohomology theories and the language of stacks]]_, 1999 

a useful survey is in

* {#Wilson13} [[Dylan Wilson]] section 1.2 of _Spectral Sequences from Sequences of Spectra: Towards the Spectrum of the Category of Spectra_ lecture at _[2013 Pre-Talbot Seminar](http://math.harvard.edu/~hirolee/pretalbot2013/)_, March 2013 ([[DylanWilsonOnANSS.pdf:file]])

a wealth of details is in

* {#Ravenel86} [[Doug Ravenel]], _[[Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_, 1987/2003 ([pdf](http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/mybooks/ravenelA1.pdf))

and new foundations have been laid in

* {#LurieHigherAlgebra} [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Higher Algebra]]_

Further useful lecture notes pointed to above include the following:

* {#Hatcher04} [[Alan Hatcher]], _[Spectral sequences in algebraic topology](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/SSAT/SSATpage.html)_ _II: The Adams spectral sequence_, 2004 ([pdf](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/SSAT/SSch2.pdf))

* {#Rognes12} [[John Rognes]], _The Adams spectral sequence_ (following [Bruner](#Bruner)), 2012 ([pdf](http://folk.uio.no/rognes/papers/notes.050612.pdf))
