## Idea

In ([[particle physics|particle]]-)[[physics]] the term "naturalness" refers to the vague idea that a [[model (physics)|model]] with "very large" or "very small" parameters is "unnatural". 

This idea has been very influential in particle physics in the 1980s-201xs, often taken as an argument for why the [[standard model of particle physics]] needs to exhibit low energy global [[supersymmetry]]... at least before the measurements of the [[LHC]], which make global low energy supersymmetry increasingly unlikely.

> {#WilsonOnNaturalness} $[ \cdots ]$ The claim was that it would be unnatural for such particles to have masses small enough to be detectable soon. But this claim makes no sense when one becomes familiar with the history of physics. There have been a number of cases where numbers arose that were unexpectedly small or large. An early example was the very large distance to the nearest star as compared to the distance to the Sun, as needed by Copernicus, because otherwise the nearest stars would have exhibited measurable parallax as the Earth moved around the Sun. Within elementary particle physics, one has unexpectedly large ratios of masses, such as the large ratio of the muon mass to the electron mass. There is also the very small value of the weak coupling constant. In the time since my paper was written, another set of unexpectedly small masses was discovered: the neutrino masses. There is also the riddle of dark energy in cosmology, with its implication of possibly an extremely small value for the cosmological constant in Einstein’s theory of general relativity. This blunder was potentially more serious, if it caused any subsequent researchers to dismiss possibilities for very large or very small values for parameters that now must be taken seriously.
