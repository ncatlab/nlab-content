## Idea

In ([[particle physics|particle]]-)[[physics]] the term "naturalness" refers to the vague idea that a [[model (physics)|model]] of physics is expected to work without requiring unlikely-looking ad-hoc coincidences of its parameters, and that instead all such "conspiracies" among parameter values are to have some systematic cause, such as some [[symmetry]] of the model.

An archetypical example, which at times has been referred to as _the_ naturalness probem of the [[standard model of particle physics]], is that the [[mass]] of the [[Higgs boson]] is first of all many orders of magnitude below the [[Planck scale]], while at the same time potentially receiving very large potential quantum corrections from the presence of (potentially undetected) heavy particles, which therefore must coincidentally cancel out.

Accordingly, a popular suggestion has been that there should be a symmetry which is to naturally explain this otherwise coincidental cancellation, namely low-energy [[supersymmetry]]. The failure of such a symmetry to be observed at the [[LHC]] experiment is leading to a re-examination of the naturalness paradigm.

A key problem is arguably that the principle has been used in a very vague and very ambiguous sense. Even apart from the problem of which large or small numbers are to be regarded as "unlikely" (see the [quote below](#WilsonOnNaturalness) from [Wilson 04](#Wilson04)), there is technical fine print. An attempt to bring some clarity into the situation is in ([Clarke 17](#Clarke17)).

> {#WilsonOnNaturalness} $[ \cdots ]$ The claim was that it would be unnatural for such particles to have masses small enough to be detectable soon. But this claim makes no sense when one becomes familiar with the history of physics. There have been a number of cases where numbers arose that were unexpectedly small or large. An early example was the very large distance to the nearest star as compared to the distance to the Sun, as needed by Copernicus, because otherwise the nearest stars would have exhibited measurable parallax as the Earth moved around the Sun. Within elementary particle physics, one has unexpectedly large ratios of masses, such as the large ratio of the muon mass to the electron mass. There is also the very small value of the weak coupling constant. In the time since my paper was written, another set of unexpectedly small masses was discovered: the neutrino masses. There is also the riddle of dark energy in cosmology, with its implication of possibly an extremely small value for the cosmological constant in Einstein’s theory of general relativity. This blunder was potentially more serious, if it caused any subsequent researchers to dismiss possibilities for very large or very small values for parameters that now must be taken seriously.
