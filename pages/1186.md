## Idea 

The notion of _locally presentable $(\infty,1)$-category_ is the analog in [[(∞,1)-category]] theory of [[locally presentable category]] in ordinary [[category theory]]:

There is a wealth of equivalent ways to make precise what this means, which are listed below. Two simple ones are:

a locally presentable $(\infty,1)$-category $C$ is precisely

* a [[reflective (∞,1)-subcategory]] of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] 

  $$
    C \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow} PSh_{(\infty,1)}(K)
    \,;
  $$

* equivalent to the full subcategory $A^\circ$ of a [[combinatorial simplicial model category]] $A$ on fibrant-cofibrant objects 

  (where the [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] $A^\circ$ is regarded as an $(\infty,1)$-category, for instance as a [[quasi-category]] after applying the [[homotopy coherent nerve]]).

If the [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] to the [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] $C \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ also preserves finite [[limit]]s, then the locally presentable $C$ is an [[(∞,1)-topos]].


**Warning on terminology.** In [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] -- where the notion has been introduced -- the term _presentable $(\infty,1)$-category_ is used for what we call a _locally presentable $(\infty,1)$-category_ here, in order to be in line with the established terminology in ordinary [[category theory]]. 


### Presentation by simplicial model categories 

Presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories are precisely those [[(∞,1)-categories]] which are _presented_ by a [[combinatorial simplicial model category]] $C$ in that they are the full [[simplicially enriched category|simplicial subcategory]] $C^\circ \hookrightarrow C$ on fibrant-cofibrant objects of $C$ 

(Or, equivalently, the [[quasi-category]] associated to this [[simplicially enriched category]]).

Under this presentation,
equivalence of presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories corresponds precisely
to spans of [[Quillen equivalence]]s between presenting
[[combinatorial simplicial model category|combinatorial simplicial model categories]].

$C^\circ$ and $D^\circ$ are equivalent as $(\infty,1)$-categories precisely
if there exists a chain of simplicial Quillen equivalence

$$
  C 
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  \stackrel{\to}{\leftarrow}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  \cdots  
  D.
$$

This is remark A.3.7.7 in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]].

Partly due to the fact that [[simplicial model category|simplicial model categories]] have been studied for a longer time -- partly because they are simply more tractable -- than [[(∞,1)-categories]], many $(\infty,1)$-categories are indeed handled in terms of such a presentation by a [[simplicial model category]]. 

The canonical example is the presentation of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on an ordinary (1-categorical) [[site]] $S$ by the simplicial [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model category of simplicial presheaves]] on $S$.


### Presentation by conglomerates of objects in a small $(\infty,1)$-category 

From another perspective, the notion of a presentable [[(∞,1)-category]] is a means to handle [[large category|large]] $(\infty,1)$-categories in terms of small ones.
It is is a slight refinement of the notion of an [[accessible (∞,1)-category]].

A _presentable_ $(\infty,1)$-category is one which may be [[large category|large]], but can entirely be _presented_ as an $(\infty,1)$-category of "conglomerates of objects" in a small $(\infty,1)$-category -- precisely: that it is [[accessible (infinity,1)-category|accessible]] but also admits all small [[limit in quasi-categories|colimits]].

This means that it is desireable to get hold of presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories. The following long list of equivalent definitions allows for many equivalent characterization of presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories. In particular, all [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves]] are presentable.

## Definition 

An [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ is **presentable** precisely if the following equivalent conditions hold.


* $C$ is [[accessible (infinity,1)-category|accessible]] and admits small [[limit in quasi-categories|colimits]];


* $C$ is the [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]]:

  there exists a small $(\infty,1)$-category $D$ and a functor $f: PSh(D) \to C$ from the [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on $D$ with a [[(infinity,1)-fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[right adjoint]].

  * (if in addition $f$ is left [[exact functor|exact]] then $C$ is an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $C$)


This is equivalent to all of the following equivalent statements.


* there exists a [[combinatorial simplicial model category]] $A$ and (with $C$ incarnated as a [[quasi-category]]) an equivalence $ C \simeq N(A^\circ)$ of $C$ with the [[homotopy coherent nerve]] of the full [[sSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] [[subcategory]] of $A$ on fibrant and cofirant objects.


* $C$ is [[accessible (infinity,1)-category|accessible]] and for every [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ the full subcategory $C^\kappa$ (...explanation to be filled in...) admits $\kappa$-small [[limit in quasi-categories|colimits]];


* there exists a [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ such that $C$ is $\kappa$-[[accessible (infinity,1)-category|accessible]] and $C^\kappa$ ([explanation]()) admits $\kappa$-small [[limit in quasi-categories|colimits]];

* there exists a [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]] $\kappa$, a small $(\infty,1)$-category $D$ with $\kappa$-small [[limit in quasi-categories|colimits]] and an equivalence $Ind_\kappa D \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} D$ of $D$ with the category of $\kappa$-[[ind-object]]s of $D$;

* $C$ is [[locally small (infinity,1)-category|locally small]], admits small colimits, and there exists a [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ and a small [[set]] $Cmptcs$ of $\kappa$-[[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact object]]s of $C$ such that every object in $C$ is a [[limit in quasi-categories|colimit]] of a small diagram in the full subcategory on $Cmpcts$.

## Details

...

That [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category|localizations]] $C \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow} PSh_{(\infty,1)}(K)$ correspond to combinatorial simplicial model categories is essentially **[Dugger's theorem](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/combinatorial+model+category#DuggerTheorem)**: every [[combinatorial model category]] arises, up to Quillen equivalence, as the left [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the global projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].
