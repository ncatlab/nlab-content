So far we have discussed [[extended prequantum field theory]]: [[Lagrangians]] and their induced [[action functionals]] and [[prequantum n-bundles]]. Now we turn to actual [[quantum field theory]]. A [[prequantum field theory]] is supposed to induce a [[quantum field theory]] under the last step of [[higher geometric quantization]]: a choice of [[polarization]] (or equivalent) and the passage to the corresponding [[space of states]] of polarized [[sections]] of the [[prequantum n-bundles]]. This step that connects [[prequantum field theory]] with [[quantum field theory]] we discuss below in _[Geometric Quantization](#GeometricQuantization)_.

Here we discuss the structure of the _outcome_ of this process.
