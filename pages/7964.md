## Idea

The _Higgs field_ or _[[Higgs boson]]_ is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[physical field]]/[[fundamental particle]]  in a [[gauge theory]] such as the [[standard model of particle physics]] supposedly responsible for giving elementary particles their [[mass|masses]] by the _[[Higgs mechanism]]_. 

## Models

There is no lack of proposals for realizing the Higgs field in various big schemes of mathematical structures modelling physics. 

For instance

* in the [[technicolor]] model the Higgs field is not a fundamental particle but a compound of fermions. This realizes the Higgs effect entirely in ordinary [[gauge theory]]; 

* in [[string theory]] (see _[[string phenomenology]]_) a Higgs can arise in all sorts of ways. Notably in "intersecting brane models" it arises from strings localized at intersecting points (for a typical kind of survey see for instance [around slide 33 here](http://www-tap.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sc2/Kobayashi.pdf#page=33)) 

* in [[noncommutative geometry]] it has been [shown](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/standard+model+of+particle+physics#NCGeometry) that the Higgs may be modeled as a component of the gauge bosons assuming that the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] is over a certain non-commutative space of classical dimension 0.
