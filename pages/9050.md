## Idea

The [[Hodge theorem]] asserts, in particular, that for a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifold]], the canonical $(p,q)$-[[graded object|grading]] of its [[differential forms]] descends to its [[de Rham cohomology]]/[[ordinary cohomology]]. The resulting structure is called a _[[Hodge structure]]_, and is indeed the archetypical example of such.
