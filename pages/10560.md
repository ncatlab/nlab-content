## Idea

A **triangulated functor** $F : T \to T'$ between two [[triangulated categories]] $T$ and $T'$ is an [[additive functor]] that commutes with translation and preserves the distinguished triangles.

([Neeman 01, def. 2.1.1](#Neeman01))

Triangulated functors are also called _exact functors_ (not to be confused with the _other_ meaning of _[[exact functor]]_).
