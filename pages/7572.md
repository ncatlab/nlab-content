## Idea

The _Heine-Borel theorem_ asserts that a [[subspace]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of a [[Euclidean space]] is a [[compact topological space]] precisely if it is [[closed subset|closed]] and [[bounded subset|bounded]].

More generally, it says that a [[metric space]] is [[compact space|compact]] precisely if it is [[complete metric space|complete]] and [[totally bounded metric space|totally bounded]].

## References

The theorem is due to [[Eduard Heine]] and [[Ã‰mile Borel]].
