## Definition

An algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is __integral__ if for any [[Zariski topology|Zariski]] [[open subset]] $U\subset X$ the ring of sections $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ of the [[structure sheaf]] over $U$ is an [[integral domain]]. 

## Properties

### Equivalent characterizations

A scheme is integral iff it is both [[reduced scheme|reduced]] and [[irreducible topological space|irreducible]]. Integral schemes of finite type over the [[spectrum]] of an [[algebraically closed field]] correspond (in the sense of [[equivalence of categories]]) to classical [[algebraic varieties]].
