An algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is __integral__ if for any Zariski open subset $U\subset X$ the ring of sections $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ of the structure sheaf over $U$ is an [[integral domain]]. 

Basic fact: a scheme is integral iff it is both [[reduced scheme|reduced]] and [[irreducible topological space|irreducible]].
