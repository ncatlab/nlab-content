## Idea

The _$J$-homomorphism_ is traditionally a family of [[group]] homomorphisms

$$
  J_i : \pi_i(O(n)) \to \pi_{n+i}(S^n)
$$

from the [[homotopy groups]] of the [[orthogonal group]] to those of the [[sphere spectrum]].

This refines to a morphism of [[infinity-groups]]

$$
  J : O \to GL_1(\mathbb{S})
$$

to the [[infinity-group of units]] of the sphere spectrum, regarded as an [[E-infinity ring spectrum]].

## Applications

By postcomposition with $B J : B O \to B GL_1(\mathbb{S}) $ the $J$-homomorphism sends real [[vector bundles]] to sphere-spectrum bundles ([[(infinity,1)-vector bundles]] over the sphere spectrum). See also at _[[Thom space]]_.
