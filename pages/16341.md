## Idea

Generalizing the classical notion of [[monoid]], one can define a _monoid_ (or _monoid object_) in any [[monoidal category]] $(C,\otimes,I)$.
Classical monoids are of course just monoids in [[Set]] with the [[cartesian product]].

By the [[microcosm principle]], in order to define monoid objects in $C$, $C$ itself must be a "categorified monoid" in some way.  The natural requirement is that it be a [[monoidal category]].  In fact, it suffices if $C$ is a [[multicategory]].  Contrast this with a [[group object]], which can only be defined in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] (or a [[cartesian multicategory]]).

## Definition

Namely, a **monoid in $C$** is an object $M$ equipped with a multiplication $\mu: M \otimes M \to M$ and a unit $\eta: I \to M$ satisfying the **associative law**:

and the **left and right unit laws**:

Here $\alpha$ is the [[associator]] in $C$, while $\lambda$ and $\rho$ are the left and right [[unitor|unitors]].

## Morphism of monoids

The analogue of a monoid homomorphism, called a morphism of monoids, is a morphism, $\f: M \to M'$  between two monoid objects, satisfying the equations;


$f \circ \mu = \mu' \circ (f \otimes f)$

$f \circ \eta = \eta'$

corresponding to the commutative diagrams;

## As categories with one object

Just as the category of regular [[monoid|monoids]] is equivalent to the category of locally small (i.e. Set-enriched) categories with one object, the category of monoids in $C$ (with the obvious morphisms) is equivalent to the category of $C$-[[enriched category|enriched categories]] with one object.
