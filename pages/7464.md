
In [[complex analysis]], the Goursat theorem is the extension (due to [[Édouard Goursat]]) of the [[Cauchy integral theorem]] from [[continuously differentiable functions]] (for which [[Augustin Cauchy]] had proved it) to [[differentiable functions]] (which requires a harder and more technical argument).  Given Cauchy's other work, the immediate corollary is that every differentiable function is in fact [[analytic function]]; see [[holomorphic function]].  This corollary may also be viewed as the Goursat theorem; everything else in the basic theory of holomorphic functions is due to Cauchy, while Goursat\'s contribution was to remove the hypothesis that the derivative of such a function must be continuous.
