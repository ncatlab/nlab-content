## Idea


An ordinary [[spectral triple]] is, discussed there, the abstract algebraic data characterizing [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] on a [[worldline]] and thereby spectrally encoding an effective (possibly [[non-commutative geometry|non-commutative]]) [[target space]] [[geometry]]. 
Ordinary [[Riemannian geometry]] with [[spin structure]] is the special case of this where the [[Hilbert space]] in the spectral triple is that os square integrable [[sections]] of the [[spinor bundle]] and the operator $D$ acting on that is the standard [[Dirac operator]], hence the "supercharge" of the worldline supersymmetry of the [[spinning particle]].

In generalization of this, a "2-spectral triple" should be the analogous algebraic data that encodes the [[worldsheet]] theory of a [[superstring]] propagating on a [[target space]] geometry which is a generalization of [[Riemannian geometry]] with ([[twisted string structure]]) [[string structure]].

Of course such data is just that of a [[2d superconformal field theory]], realized locally for instance by a [[vertex operator algebra]] or by a [[conformal net]] of [[local net of observables|local observables]]. But for emphasis it may be useful to speak of such data as constituting a "2-spectral triple", for emphasizing more the important and intricate relation to the concept of [[spectral triples]], which in much of the literature seems to be unduly ignored.

That the 0-mode sector of a [[2d SCFT]] -- hence the quantum point [[particle]] limit of a quantum [[superstring]] dynamics -- yields a [[spectral triple]] was maybe first highlighted in ([Fröhlich-Gawędzki 93](#FroehlichGaweddzki93)) by way of a series of concrete examples, such as the [[WZW model]]. Here the [[Dirac operator]] of the spectral triple is the [[Dirac-Ramond operator]] of the [[superstring]], hence the operator whose [[index]] (in the [[large volume limit]]) is the [[Witten genus]]. A formalizaion of this process sending a super [[vertex operator algebra]] to a spectral triple was then described in ([Roggenkamp-Wendland 03](#RoggenkampWendland03)), reviewed in ([Roggenkamp-Wendland 08](#RoggenkampWendland08))


## Examples

### Flop transition

There is at least evidence that there is a continuous path in the space of 2-spectral triples that starts and ends at a point describing the ordinary geometry of a complex 3-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau space]] but passes in between through a 2-spectral triple/2d SCFT (a [[Gepner model]]) which is not the $\sigma$-model of an ordinary geometry, hence which describes "noncommutative 2-geometry" (to borrow that terminology from the situation of ordinary spectral triples). This is called the [[flop transition]] (alluding to the fact that the geometries at the start and end of this path have different [[topology]]). This was further expanded on and used for the mathematical study of the [[large volume limit]] of [[string theory]] [[vacua]] in ([Soibelman 11](#Soibelman11)).
