## Definition

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]], its **nilradical** $I \subset R$ is the [[ideal]] of nilpotent elements: the collection of those elements $a \in R$ such that there is $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $a^n = 0$.

The [[quotient]] $R/I$ is also called the _reduced_ part of $R$.

(If $R$ is not commutative there are different generalization of the notion of nilradical. See wikipedia, for the moment.)

With rings regarded as [[Isbell duality|formal dual]]s of [[affine scheme]]s, the canonical inclusion

$$
  Spec R/I \to Spec R
$$

is to be thought of as exhibiting the inclusion of $Spec R/I$ into an [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal thickening]] of itself.

For $X : CRing \to Set$ a [[presheaf]] on the [[category]] of [[commutative rings]], the presheaf

$$
  X_{dR} : Spec R \mapsto X(Spec R/I)
$$

is called the [[de Rham space]] of $X$.
