## Idea 

Just as [[functor|functors]] is a [[morphism]] between [[category|categories]], a natural transformations is a [[2-morphism]] between two functors.

Natural transformations are the [[2-morphism]]s in the [[2-category]] [[Cat]].

## Definition ##

### Explicit definition

Given [[categories]] $C$ and $D$ and [[functor]]s $F, G:C \to D,$ a __natural transformation__ $\alpha:F \Rightarrow G$, denoted

$$
  \array{
    \\
    & \nearrow \searrow^F
    \\
    C
    &\Downarrow^{\alpha}&
    D
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_G
  }
  \,,
$$

is an assignment to every [[object]] $x$ in $C$ of a [[morphism]] 
$\alpha_x:F(x) \to G(x)$ in $D$ (called the __component__ of $\alpha$ at $x$) such that for any morphism $f:x \to y$ in $C$, the following [[diagram]] [[commuting diagram|commutes]] in $D$:

\[ 
  \array{ 
    F(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(y) 
  }
  \,. 
\] 

### Composition

Natural transformations between functors $C \to D$ and $D \to E$ compose in the obvious way to natural transformations $C \to E$ (this is their [[vertical composition]] in the [[2-category]] [[Cat]])
and functors $F : C \to D$ with natural transformations between them form the [[functor category]] 

$$
  [C,D] \in Cat
$$ 

The notation alludes to the fact that this makes [[Cat]] a [[closed monoidal category]].  Since $Cat$ is in fact a [[cartesian closed category]], another common notation is $D^C$.  In fact, if we want $Cat$ to be [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], the definition of natural transformation is forced (since an [[adjoint functor]] is unique). This is discussed in [a section below](#InTermsOfCartMon).

There is also a [[horizontal composition]] of natural transformations, which makes [[Cat]] a [[2-category]]: the [[Godement product]]. See there for details. 

In fact, [[Cat]] is a 2-category (a $Cat$-enriched category) _because_ it is (cartesian) closed: closed monoidal categories are automatically enriched over themselves, via their [[internal hom]].

An alternative but ultimately equivalent way to define a natural transformation $\alpha : F \rightarrow G$ is as an assignment to every morphism $m : x \rightarrow y$ in $C$ of a morphism $\alpha(m) : F(x) \rightarrow G(y)$, in such a way as that $\alpha(m_0 m_1 m_2) = G(m_0) \alpha(m_1) F(m_2)$ for every ternary composition $m_0m_1m_2$ in $C$. The relation of this to the previous definition is that the commutative squares in the previous definition for any morphism $f$ give the value $\alpha(f)$, and each $\alpha(id_x)$ gives the component $\alpha_x$. Composition of natural transformations can be specified directly in terms of this account as well: specifically, an $n$-ary composition $\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n$ of natural transformations is uniquely determined by the property that $(\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n)(m_1 ... m_n) = \alpha_1(m_1) ... \alpha_n(m_n)$, for every $n$-ary composition $m_1 ... m_n$ in $C$.

### In terms of the cartesian closed monoidal structure on $Cat$ {#InTermsOfCartMon}

The definition of the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$ with morphisms being natural transformations is precisely the one that makes $Cat$ a [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[closed monoidal category]].

The category [[Cat]] of all categories (regarded for the moment just as an ordinary 1-[[category]]) is a [[cartesian monoidal category]]: for every two categories $C$ and $D$ there is the cartesian [[product]] category $C \times D$, whose objects and morphisms are simply pairs of objects and morphisms in $C$ and $D$: $Mor(C \times D) = Mor(C) \times Mor(D)$.

It therefore makes sense to ask if there is for each category $C \in Cat$ an [[internal hom]] functor $[C,-] : Cat \to Cat$ that would make [[Cat]] into a [[closed monoidal category]] in that for $A,B,C \in Cat$ we have natural isomorphisms of _sets_ of functors

$$
  Funct(A \times C , B) \simeq Funct(A, [C,B])
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the case for $[C,B]$ being the [[functor category]] with functors $C \to B$ as objects and natural transformations, as defined above, as morphisms.

Since $Cat$ here is cartesian closed, one often uses the exponential notation $B^C := [B,C]$ for the functor category.

To derive from this the definition of natural transformations above, it is sufficient to consider the [[interval category]] $A := I := \{a \to b\}$. For any category $E$, a functor $I \to E$ is precisely a choice of morphism in $E$. This means that we can check what a morphism in the [[internal hom]] category $[C,B]$ is by checking what functors $I \to [C,D]$ are. But by the defining property of $[C,D]$ as an [[internal hom]], such functors are in natural bijection to functors $I \times C \to B$.

$$
  Funct(I, [C,B]) \simeq Funct(I \times C, B)
  \,.
$$

But, as mentioned above, we kown what the category $I \times C$ is like: its morphisms are pairs of morphisms in $I$ and $C$, subject to the obvious composition law, which says in particular that for $f : c_1 \to c_2$ any morphism in $C$ we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(f,(a \to b))}{\to} (c_2,b)
    & =
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(f, Id)}{\to} (c_2,a) 
    \stackrel{(Id, (a \to b)}{\to}
    (c_2, b)
    \\
    &=
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(Id, (a\to b))}{\to} (c_1,b) 
    \stackrel{(f,Id}{\to}
    (c_2, b)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the right side is more conveniently depicted as a commuting square

$$
  \array{
     (c_1,a) &\stackrel{(f,Id)}{\to}& (c_2,a)
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,(a \to b))}} 
     && 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id, (a \to b))}}
     \\
     (c_1,b) &\stackrel{(f,Id)}{\to}& (c_2,b)
  }
  \,.
$$

So a natural transformation between functors $C \to D$ is given by the images of such squares in $D$. By tracing back the way the hom-isomorphism works, one finds that the image of such a square in $D$ for a natural transformation $\alpha : F \to G$ is the naturality square from above:

$$
  \array{ 
    F(c_1) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(c_2) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(c_1) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(c_2) 
  }
  \,. 
$$ 


### In terms of double categories 

There is a nice way of describing these structures due to [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For a category $D$ let $(\square D,\circ_1,\circ_2)$  be the double category of commutative squares in $D$. Then the class of natural transformations of functors $C \to D$ can be described as $Cat(C,(\square D,\circ_1))$. But then $\circ_2$ induces a category structure on this and so we get $CAT(C,D)$. 

An advantage of this approach is that it applies to the case of topological categories and groupoids (working in a convenient category of spaces). 

An analogous approach works for strict cubical $\omega$-categories with connections, using the good properties of [[cube]]s, so leading to a [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed structure]] for these objects. This yields by an [[equivalence of categories]] a monoidal closed structure on [[strict omega-category|strict globular omega-categories]], where the [[tensor product]] is the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].


## Variations

For functors between [[n-category|higher categories]], see [[lax natural transformation]] etc.

A transformation which is natural only relative to [[isomorphisms]] may be called a [[canonical transformation]].

For functors with more complicated shapes than $C \rightrightarrows D$, see [[extranatural transformation]] and [[dinatural transformation]].
