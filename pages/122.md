## Idea ##

Just as [[functor|functors]] is a [[morphism]] between [[category|categories]], a natural transformations is a morphism between two functors.

## Definition ##

Given categories $C$ and $D$ and functors $F, G:C \to D,$ a __natural transformation__ $\alpha:F \Rightarrow G$, denoted

$$
  \array{
    \\
    & \nearrow \searrow^F
    \\
    C
    &\Downarrow^{\alpha}&
    D
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_G
  }
  \,,
$$

assigns to every [[object]] $x$ in $C$ a [[morphism]] 
$\alpha_x:F(x) \to G(x)$ in $D$ (called the __component__ of $\alpha$ at $x$) such that for any morphism $f:x \to y$ in $C$, the following diagram commutes in $D$:

\[ 
  \array{ 
    F(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(y) 
  }
  \,. 
\] 

Natural transformations between functors $C \to D$ compose in the obvious way
and functors $F : C \to D$ with natural transformations between them form the [[functor category]] 

$$
  [C,D] \in Cat
$$ 

The notation alludes to the fact that this makes [[Cat]] a [[closed monoidal category]].  Since $Cat$ is in fact a [[cartesian closed category]], another common notation is $D^C$.  In fact, if we want $Cat$ to be cartesian closed, the definition of natural transformation is forced (since an [[adjoint functor]] is unique).

There is also a horizontal composition of natural transformations, which makes [[Cat]] a [[2-category]]. In fact, [[Cat]] is a 2-category (a $Cat$-enriched category) _because_ it is (cartesian) closed: closed monoidal categories are automatically enriched over themselves, via their [[internal hom]]. 

## in terms of the cartesian closed monoidal structure on $Cat$ ##

The definition of the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$ with morphisms being natural transformations is precisely the one that makes $Cat$ a [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[closed monoidal category]].

The category [[Cat]] of all categories (regarded for the moment just as an ordinary 1-[[category]]) is a [[cartesian monoidal category]]: for every two categories $C$ and $D$ there is the cartesian [[product]] category $C \times D$, whose objects and morphisms are simply pairs of objects and morphisms in $C$ and $D$: $Mor(C \times D) = Mor(C) \times Mor(D)$.

It therefore makes sense to ask if there is for each category $C \in Cat$ an [[internal hom]] functor $[C,-] : Cat \to Cat$ that would make [[Cat]] into a [[closed monoidal category]] in that for $A,B,C \in Cat$ we have natural isomorphisms of _sets_ of functors

$$
  Funct(A \times C , B) \simeq Funct(A, [C,B])
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the case for $[C,B]$ being the [[functor category]] with functors $C \to B$ as objects and natural transformations, as defined above, as morphisms.

Since $Cat$ here is cartesian closed, one often uses the exponential notation $B^C := [B,C]$ for the functor category.

To derive from this the definition of natural transformations above, it is sufficient to consider the [[interval category]] $A := I := \{a \to b\}$. For any category $E$, a functor $I \to E$ is precisely a choice of morphism in $E$. This means that we can check what a morphism in the [[internal hom]] category $[C,B]$ is by checking what functors $I \to [C,D]$ are. But by the defining property of $[C,D]$ as an [[internal hom]], such functors are in natural bijection to functors $I \times C \to B$.

$$
  Funct(I, [C,B]) \simeq Funct(I \times C, B)
  \,.
$$

But, as mentioned above, we kown what the category $I \times C$ is like: its morphisms are pairs of morphisms in $I$ and $C$, subject to the obvious composition law, which says in particular that for $f : c_1 \to c_2$ any morphism in $C$ we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(f,(a \to b))}{\to} (c_2,b)
    & =
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(f, Id)}{\to} (c_2,a) 
    \stackrel{(Id, (a \to b)}{\to}
    (c_2, b)
    \\
    &=
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(Id, (a\to b))}{\to} (c_1,b) 
    \stackrel{(f,Id}{\to}
    (c_2, b)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the right side is more conveniently depicted as a commuting square

$$
  \array{
     (c_1,a) &\stackrel{(f,Id)}{\to}& (c_2,a)
     \\
     \downarrow^{\rlap{(Id,(a \to b))}} 
     && 
     \downarrow^{\rlap{(Id, (a \to b))}}
     \\
     (c_1,b) &\stackrel{(f,Id)}{\to}& (c_2,b)
  }
  \,.
$$

So a natural transformation between functors $C \to D$ is given by the images of such squares in $D$. By tracing back the way the hom-isomorphism works, one finds that the image of such a square in $D$ for a natural transformation $\alpha : F \to G$ is the naturality square from above:

$$
  \array{ 
    F(c_1) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(c_2) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(c_1) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(c_2) 
  }
  \,. 
$$ 


## in terms of double categories ##

There is a nice way of describing these structures due to [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For a category $D$ let $(\square D,\circ_1,\circ_2)$  be the double category of commutative squares in $D$. Then the class of natural transformations of functors $C \to D$ can be described as $Cat(C,(\square D,\circ_1))$. But then $\circ_2$ induces a category structure on this and so we get $CAT(C,D)$. 

An advantage of this approach is that it applies to the case of topological categories and groupoids (working in a convenient category of spaces). 

An analogous approach works for strict cubical $\omega$-categories with connections, using the good properties of [[cube]]s, so leading to a [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed structure]] for these objects. This yields by an [[equivalence of categories]] a monoidal closed structure on [[strict omega-category|strict globular omega-categories]], where the [[tensor product]] is the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]]. 

##Discussion##

[[Eric]]: For some reason, I always thought a natural transformation was a more general map between functors $\alpha:F\Rightarrow G$, where
$$F:A\to B\quad\text{and}\quad G:C\to D.$$

Then $\alpha(F):C\to D$ is a functor and we'd probably also want **2-component** functors $\alpha_C:A\to C$ and $\alpha_D:B\to D$ such that the following diagram commutes
$$ 
  \array{ 
    A 
    & 
    \stackrel{F}{\to} 
    & 
    B 
    \\ 
    \mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha_C}}\downarrow 
    &\mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha}}\Downarrow & 
    \downarrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{\alpha_D}}
    \\ C 
    & 
    \stackrel{G}{\to} & D 
  }
$$
If this is not a natural transformation, is there another name for it?

When $A = C$ and $B = D$, this should coincide with the usual definition. If so, why don't we define natural transformation in this more general way? It seems more "natural" to me.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: I suppose your 2-arrow in the middle labeled $\alpha$ is supposed to be a natural transformation (in the standard sense)? 

Then this is a square in the 2-category of categories. Such squares appear in turn as the _components_ of [[lax natural transformation]]s of 2-functors into [[Cat]].

[[Eric]]: Thanks. I was hesitant to put that 2-arrow in there. I'm still learning this stuff and am on shaky ground. But no. That 2-arrow is not supposed to be a natural transformation in the traditional sense because it is not a map between functors with the same domain and codomain. It is tempting to say we might want $\alpha_D\circ F\Rightarrow\alpha_C\circ G$ to be a natural transformation in the traditional sense though.

_Toby_:  That arrow certainly *looks* to me like a $2$-arrow from $\alpha_D\circ F$ to $\alpha_C\circ G$.  Unless it has no particular meaning and is just labelling the entire square as $\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G$.  In any case, there is the question of what, if anything, goes between $\alpha_D\circ F$ and $\alpha_C\circ G$.  If nothing, then I would call such a thing a __square__ of functors.  If something more interesting, see my answer at [[ericforgy:Natural Transformation]] (which I saw first).

_Todd_: Here's one way of considering how the standard notion of natural transformation is the "right" one. Just as in topology we would like to consider the "space of all continuous maps $X \to Y$" from one space to another as a topological space, and the right notion of topology so we get an appropriate universal property, we want the same thing here. So the term analogous to "space" is "category", the term analogous to "continuous map" is "functor", and the term analogous to "space of all continuous maps from one space to another" or "function space" is "category of all functors from one category to another" or "functor category". And there should be a universal property which gives the right such category. 

In the end, if $D^C$ denotes the functor category, the universal property provides an equivalence between functors $X \to D^C$ and functors $X \times C \to D$. Pursuing this, let's figure out what morphisms in $D^C$ should look like. In an ordinary category $Y$, a morphism in $Y$ corresponds to a functor $\mathbf{2} \to Y$, where $\mathbf{2}$ is a category with two objects $0, 1$ and exactly one nonidentity arrow $0 \to 1$. So morphisms in $D^C$ should correspond to functors $\mathbf{2} \to D^C$. And the universal property says these are equivalent to functors $\mathbf{2} \times C \to D$. Now: if you carefully work through what functors of that form give you, you get precisely the notion of natural transformation. This is an exercise well worth working out. 

This is how you know the notion of natural transformation is morally the "right" one. 

[[Urs Schreiber]]: I added above a subsection on this characterization in terms of the cartesian closed monoidal structure on $Cat$.

[[Eric]]: I think I got it. 

Given two functors $F:A\to B$ and $G:C\to D$, let $\alpha:F\Rightarrow G$ together with component functors $\alpha_C:A\to C$ and $\alpha_D:B\to D$ be a map such that 
$$\alpha_D\circ F\Rightarrow G\circ\alpha_C$$
is a natural transformation (in the standard sense). Does this guy have a name?

The reason why I bring this up is that I do not like bigons. Bigons are not a good shape for doing computational geometry, geometric realization, etc. So before I could finally grok what a [[cone]] was, I had to draw a bunch of diagrams. These diagrams were bigons. Yucky!

Thanks Todd. That was a valiant effort, but didn't manage to convince me (I have a thick skull!). I still like this more general definition. Given topological spaces $W,X,Y,Z$, we could also be interested in studying spaces $(W\to X)\Rightarrow (Y\to Z)$. What you described would then be a special case where $W=Y$ and $X=Z$.

Here is my attempt to formalize an alternative definition:

>##Definition##

>Given categories $A$,$B$,$C$,$D$ and functors $F:A\to B$,$G:C\to D$ a __natural transformation__ $\alpha:F \Rightarrow G$

    \stackrel{G}{\to} & D 
  }
$$
>assigns functors $\alpha_C:A\to C$ and $\alpha_D:B\to D$ called **component functors** and for any morphism $f:x\to y$ in $A$ assigns morphisms $\alpha_x:\alpha_D\circ F(x)\to G\circ\alpha_C(x)$ and $\alpha_y:\alpha_D\circ F(y)\to G\circ\alpha_C(y)$ in $D$ called **component morphisms** such that the following diagram commutes in $D$:
$$ 
  \array{ 
    \alpha_D\circ F(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{\alpha_D\circ F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    \alpha_D\circ F(y) 
    \\ 
    \mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha_x}}\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{\alpha_y}} 
    \\ G\circ\alpha_C(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G\circ\alpha_C(f)}{\to} & G\circ\alpha_C(y) 
  }
$$

***

Again, this reduces to the traditional definition when $\alpha_C$ and $\alpha_D$ are identity functors. What do you think? If this doesn't already have a name (it probably does), what would be a good name for it?
