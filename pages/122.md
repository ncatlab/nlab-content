#Idea#

Just as [[functor|functors]] go between [[category|categories]], natural transformations go between functors.

#Definition#

Given categories $C$ and $D$ and functors $F, G:C \to D,$ a __natural transformation__ $\alpha:F \Rightarrow G$ 

$$
  \array{
    \\
    & \nearrow \searrow^F
    \\
    C
    &\Downarrow^{\alpha}&
    D
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_G
  }
$$
assigns to every object $x$ in $C$ a morphism 
$\alpha_x:F(x) \to G(x)$ in $D$ (called the __component__ of $\alpha$ at $x$) such that for any morphism $f:x \to y$ in $C$, the following diagram commutes in $D$:

\[ 
  \array{ 
    F(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(y) 
  }
  \,. 
\] 

Natural transformations between functors $C \to D$ compose in the obvious way
and functors $F : C \to D$ with natural transformations between them form the [[functor category]] 
$$
  [C,D]
$$ 
The notation alludes to the fact that this makes [[Cat]] a [[closed monoidal category]].  Since $Cat$ is in fact a [[cartesian closed category]], another common notation is $D^C$.  In fact, if we want $Cat$ to be cartesian closed, the definition of natural transformation is forced (since an [[adjoint functor]] is unique).

There is also a horizontal composition of natural transformations, which makes [[Cat]] a [[2-category]]. In fact, [[Cat]] is a 2-category (a $Cat$-enriched category) _because_ it is (cartesian) closed: closed monoidal categories are automatically enriched over themselves, via their [[internal hom]]. 

##Remark##

There is a nice way of describing these structures due to [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For a category $D$ let $(\square D,\circ_1,\circ_2)$  be the double category of commutative squares in $D$. Then the class of natural transformations of functors $C \to D$ can be described as $Cat(C,(\square D,\circ_1))$. But then $\circ_2$ induces a category structure on this and so we get $CAT(C,D)$. 

An advantage of this approach is that it applies to the case of topological categories and groupoids (working in a convenient category of spaces). 

An analogous approach works for strict cubical $\omega$-categories with connections, using the good properties of [[cube]]s, so leading to a [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed structure]] for these objects. This yields by an [[equivalence of categories]] a monoidal closed structure on [[strict omega-category|strict globular omega-categories]], where the [[tensor product]] is the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]]. 

##Discussion##

[[Eric]]: For some reason, I always thought a natural transformation was a more general map between functors $\alpha:F\Rightarrow G$, where
$$F:A\to B\quad\text{and}\quad G:C\to D.$$

Then $\alpha(F):C\to D$ is a functor and we'd probably also want **2-component** functors $\alpha_C:A\to C$ and $\alpha_D:B\to D$ such that the following diagram commutes
$$ 
  \array{ 
    A 
    & 
    \stackrel{F}{\to} 
    & 
    B 
    \\ 
    \mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha_C}}\downarrow 
    &\mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha}}\Downarrow & 
    \downarrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{\alpha_D}}
    \\ C 
    & 
    \stackrel{G}{\to} & D 
  }
$$
If this is not a natural transformation, is there another name for it?

When $A = C$ and $B = D$, this should coincide with the usual definition. If so, why don't we define natural transformation in this more general way? It seems more "natural" to me.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: I suppose your 2-arrow in the middle labeled $\alpha$ is supposed to be a natural transformation (in the standard sense)? 

Then this is a square in the 2-category of categories. Such squares appear in turn as the _components_ of [[lax natural transformation]]s of 2-functors into [[Cat]].

[[Eric]]: Thanks. I was hesitant to put that 2-arrow in there. I'm still learning this stuff and am on shaky ground. But no. That 2-arrow is not supposed to be a natural transformation in the traditional sense because it is not a map between functors with the same domain and codomain. It is tempting to say we might want $\alpha_D\circ F\Rightarrow\alpha_C\circ G$ to be a natural transformation in the traditional sense though.

_Toby_:  That arrow certainly *looks* to me like a $2$-arrow from $\alpha_D\circ F$ to $\alpha_C\circ G$.  Unless it has no particular meaning and is just labelling the entire square as $\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G$.  In any case, there is the question of what, if anything, goes between $\alpha_D\circ F$ and $\alpha_C\circ G$.  If nothing, then I would call such a thing a __square__ of functors.  If something more interesting, see my answer at [[ericforgy:Natural Transformation]] (which I saw first).

_Todd_: Here's one way of considering how the standard notion of natural transformation is the "right" one. Just as in topology we would like to consider the "space of all continuous maps $X \to Y$" from one space to another as a topological space, and the right notion of topology so we get an appropriate universal property, we want the same thing here. So the term analogous to "space" is "category", the term analogous to "continuous map" is "functor", and the term analogous to "space of all continuous maps from one space to another" or "function space" is "category of all functors from one category to another" or "functor category". And there should be a universal property which gives the right such category. 

In the end, if $D^C$ denotes the functor category, the universal property provides an equivalence between functors $X \to D^C$ and functors $X \times C \to D$. Pursuing this, let's figure out what morphisms in $D^C$ should look like. In an ordinary category $Y$, a morphism in $Y$ corresponds to a functor $\mathbf{2} \to Y$, where $\mathbf{2}$ is a category with two objects $0, 1$ and exactly one nonidentity arrow $0 \to 1$. So morphisms in $D^C$ should correspond to functors $\mathbf{2} \to D^C$. And the universal property says these are equivalent to functors $\mathbf{2} \times C \to D$. Now: if you carefully work through what functors of that form give you, you get precisely the notion of natural transformation. This is an exercise well worth working out. 

This is how you know the notion of natural transformation is morally the "right" one.
