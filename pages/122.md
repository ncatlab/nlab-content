#Idea#

Just as [[functor|functors]] go between [[category|categories]], natural transformations go between functors.

#Definition#

Given categories $C$ and $D$ and functors $F, G:C \to D,$ a __natural transformation__ $\alpha:F \Rightarrow G$ 

$$
  \array{
    \\
    & \nearrow \searrow^F
    \\
    C
    &\Downarrow^{\alpha}&
    D
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_G
  }
$$
assigns to every object $x$ in $C$ a morphism 
$\alpha_x:F(x) \to G(x)$ in $D$ (called the __component__ of $\alpha$ at $x$) such that for any morphism $f:x \to y$ in $C$, the following diagram commutes in $D$:

\[ 
  \array{ 
    F(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(y) 
  }
  \,. 
\] 

Natural transformations between functors $C \to D$ compose in the obvious way
and functors $F : C \to D$ with natural transformations between them form the [[functor category]] 
$$
  [C,D]
$$ 
The notation alludes to the fact that this makes [[Cat]] a [[closed monoidal category]].  Since $Cat$ is in fact a [[cartesian closed category]], another common notation is $D^C$.  In fact, if we want $Cat$ to be cartesian closed, the definition of natural transformation is forced (since an [[adjoint functor]] is unique).

There is also a horizontal composition of natural transformations, which makes [[Cat]] a [[2-category]]. In fact, [[Cat]] is a 2-category (a $Cat$-enriched category) _because_ it is (cartesian) closed: closed monoidal categories are automatically enriched over themselves, via their [[internal hom]]. 

##Remark##

There is a nice way of describing these structures due to [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For a category $D$ let $(\square D,\circ_1,\circ_2)$  be the double category of commutative squares in $D$. Then the class of natural transformations of functors $C \to D$ can be described as $Cat(C,(\square D,\circ_1))$. But then $\circ_2$ induces a category structure on this and so we get $CAT(C,D)$. 

An advantage of this approach is that it applies to the case of topological categories and groupoids (working in a convenient category of spaces). 

An analogous approach works for strict cubical $\omega$-categories with connections, using the good properties of [[cube]]s, so leading to a [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed structure]] for these objects. This yields by an [[equivalence of categories]] a monoidal closed structure on [[strict omega-category|strict globular omega-categories]], where the [[tensor product]] is the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]]. 

##Discussion##

[[Eric]]: For some reason, I always thought a natural transformation was a more general map between functors $\alpha:F\Rightarrow G$, where
$$F:A\to B\quad\text{and}\quad G:C\to D.$$

Then $\alpha(F):C\to D$ is a functor and we'd probably also want **2-component** functors $\alpha_C:A\to C$ and $\alpha_D:B\to D$ such that the following diagram commutes
$$ 
  \array{ 
    A 
    & 
    \stackrel{F}{\to} 
    & 
    B 
    \\ 
    \mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha_C}}\downarrow 
    &\mathllap{\scriptsize{\alpha}}\Downarrow & 
    \downarrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{\alpha_D}}
    \\ C 
    & 
    \stackrel{G}{\to} & D 
  }
$$
If this is not a natural transformation, is there another name for it?

When $A = C$ and $B = D$, this should coincide with the usual definition. If so, why don't we define natural transformation in this more general way? It seems more "natural" to me.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: I suppose your 2-arrow in the middle labeled $\alpha$ is supposed to be a natural transformation (in the standard sense)? 

Then this is a square in the 2-category of categories. Such squares appear in turn as the _components_ of [[lax natural transformation]]s of 2-functors into [[Cat]].

[[Eric]]: Thanks. I was hesitant to put that 2-arrow in there. I'm still learning this stuff and am on shaky ground. But no. That 2-arrow is not supposed to be a natural transformation in the traditional sense because it is not a map between functors with the same domain and codomain. It is tempting to say we might want $\alpha_D\circ F\Rightarrow\alpha_C\circ G$ to be a natural transformation in the traditional sense though.

_Toby_:  That arrow certainly *looks* to me like a $2$-arrow from $\alpha_D\circ F$ to $\alpha_C\circ G$.  Unless it has no particular meaning and is just labelling the entire square as $\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G$.  In any case, there is the question of what, if anything, goes between $\alpha_D\circ F$ and $\alpha_C\circ G$.  If nothing, then I would call such a thing a __square__ of functors.  If something more interesting, see my answer at [[ericforgy:Natural Transformation]] (which I saw first).
