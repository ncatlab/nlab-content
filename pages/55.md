#Definition#

A _Lie algebroid_ is the [[horizontal categorification|many object version]] of a Lie algebra. There are various equivalent definitions:

**Definition in terms of vector bundles with anchor map.**
A Lie algebroid over a [[manifold]] $X$ is 

 * a vector bundle $E \to X$;

 * equipped with a Lie brackets $[\cdot,\cdot] : \Gamma(E)\otimes \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E)$ on its space of sections;

 * a morphisms of vector bundles $\rho : E \to TX$;

 * such that the _Leibniz rule_ holds: for all $X, Y \in \Gamma(E)$ and all $f \in C^\infty(X)$ we have
$$
  [X, f \cdot Y] = f\cdot [X,Y] + \rho(X)(f) \cdot Y
  \,.
$$

**Definition in terms of Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra.**
A Lie algebroid over a manifold $X$ is a vector bundle 
$E \to X$ equipped with a degree +1 derivation $d$ on the free (over $C^\infty(X)$) graded-commutative algebra $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(E)^*$ (where the dual is over $C^\infty$), such that $d^2 = 0$.

This is for $\Gamma(E)$ satisfying suitable finiteness conditions.  In general, as the masters well knew, the correct definition is the algebra of alternating multilinear functions from  $\Gamma(E)$ to the ground field, assumed of characteristic 0. This can also be phrased in terms of
linear maps from the corresponding coalgebra cogenerated by 
$\Gamma(E)$, but the masters did not have coalgebras in those days.

The differential graded-commutative algebra 

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  :=
  (\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(E)^*, d)
$$

is the _Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra_ of the Lie algebroid (in that for $X = pt$ it reduces to the ordinary Chevally-Eilenberg algebra for Lie algebras). 

In the existing literature this is often addressed just as "the complex that computes Lie algebroid cohomology".

It is helpful to compare this definition to the general definition of [[Lie infinity-algebroid|Lie infinity-algebroids]], the [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras and Lie algebroids.


**Definition in terms of commutative Lie-Rinehart pairs.**

A Lie algebroid over the manifold $X$ is 

 * a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$;

 * the structure of a Lie module over $\mathfrak{g}$ on $C^\infty(X)$ (i.e. an action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on $X$);


 * the strucuture of a $C^\infty(X)$-module on $\mathfrak{g}$ (in fact: such that $\mathfrak{g}$ is a finitely generated projective module);

 * such that the two actions satisfy two compatibility conditions which are modeled on the standard relations obtained by setting $\mathfrak{g} = \Gamma(T X)$.


#Examples#

* A **Lie algebra** is a Lie algebroid over a point, $X = pt$.

* The **tangent Lie algebroid** is 

    1. in the vector bundle definition given by $E = T X$, $\rho = \mathrm{Id}$;

    2. in the CE-definition: $\mathrm{CE}(T X) = (\Omega^\bullet(X), d_{deRham})$;

*  **Bundles of Lie algebras** $E \to X$ with fiber $\mathfrak{g}$ are Lie algebroids with $\rho = 0$ and fiberwise bracket. In particular, for $G$ a Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $P \to X$ a $G$-principal bundle, the _adjoint bundle_ $ad P := P \times_G \mathfrak{g}$ (where $\mathfrak{g}$ is associated using the adjoint representation of $G$ on its Lie algebra) is a bundle of Lie algebras.

 * The **Atiyah Lie algebroid**: for $G$ a Lie group and $P \to X$ a $G$-principal bundle, the vector bundle $At(P):= T P/G$ naturally inherits the structure of a Lie algebroid. Moreover, it fits into a short exact sequence of Lie algebroids over $X$
$$
  0 \to ad P \to At(P) \to T X \to 0
$$
known as the **Atiyah sequence**. For some $n$-Caf&eacute; blog discussion of this see [n-Transport and Higher Schreier theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/09/nconnections_and_higher_schrei.html).

* The **vertical tangent Lie algebroid** $T_{vert}Y \hookrightarrow T Y$ of a smooth map $\pi : Y \to X$ of manifolds is the sub-Lie algebroid of the tangent Lie algebroid $T Y$ defined as follows:

   1. In the vector bundle perspective $E = ker(\pi_*)$ is the kernel bundle of the map $\pi_* : T Y \to T X$.

   2. In the dual picture we have $CE(T_{vert}Y) = \Omega^\bullet_{vert}(Y)$, the [[Lie infinity-algebroid|qDGCA]] of **vertical differential forms**. This is the quotient of $\Omega^\bullet(Y)$ by the ideal of those forms which vanish when restricted in all arguments to $ker(\pi_*)$.  

#Remarks#

The extent to which Lie algebroids are to [[Lie groupoid|Lie groupoids]] as Lie algebras are to Lie groups is the content of general [[Lie theory]], in which [[Lie's three theorems|Lie's theorems]] have been generalized to Lie algebroids.
