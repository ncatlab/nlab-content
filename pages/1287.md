## Idea

A _local system_  -- which is short for _local system of [[coefficients]] for [[cohomology]]_ -- is a system of coefficients for [[twisted cohomology]].

Often this is presented or taken to be presented by a [[locally constant sheaf]]. Then cohomology with coefficients in a local system is the corresponding [[sheaf cohomology]].

More generally, we say a _local system_ is a [[locally constant stack]], ... and eventually a [[locally constant ∞-stack]].

Under suitable conditions (if we have [[Galois theory]]) local systems on $X$ correspond to [[functor]]s out of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$, or more generally to [[(∞,1)-functor]]s out of the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]. These in turn are equivalently [[flat connections]] (this relation is known as the _[[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence]]_) or generally [[flat ∞-connections]].



## Definitions

A notion of [[cohomology]] exists intrinsically within any [[(∞,1)-topos]]. We discuss local systems first in this generality and then look at special cases, such as local systems as ordinary [[sheaves]].

### General 

For $\mathbf{H}$ an [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]], write

$$
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{LConst}{\to}}
  \infty Grpd
$$

be the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[(∞,1)-geometric morphism]], where $\Gamma$ is the [[global section]] [[(∞,1)-functor]] and $LConst$ the [[constant ∞-stack]]-functor.

Write $\mathcal{S} := core(Fin \infty Grpd) \in $ [[∞Grpd]] for the [[core]] [[∞-groupoid]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of finite $\infty$-groupoids. (We can drop the finiteness condition by making use of a higher [[universe]].) This is canonically a [[pointed object]] $* \to \mathcal{S}$, with points the terminal groupoid.


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $X \in \mathbf{H}$ an [[object]], a **local system** of [[locally constant ∞-stack]] on $X$ is a morphism

$$
  \tilde \nabla : X \to LConst \mathcal{S}
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$ or equivalently the object in the [[over-(∞,1)-topos]]

$$
  (P \to X) \in \mathbf{H}/X
$$

that is classified by $\tilde \nabla$ under the [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]]

$$
  \array{
    P &\to& LConst \mathcal{Z}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\tilde \nabla}{\to}&  LConst \mathcal{S}
  }
$$

In other words, local systems are [[locally constant ∞-stack]]s or [[cocycle]]s for [[cohomology with constant coefficients]].

=--

See [[principal ∞-bundle]] for discussion of how [[cocycle]]s $\tilde \nabla : X \to LConst \mathcal{S}$ classiy morphisms $P \to X$.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

If $\mathbf{H}$ happens to be a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] in that there is the further [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] $\Pi$

$$
  (\Pi \dashv LConst \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$

we call $\Pi(X)$ the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]]. In this case, by the adjunction hom-equivalence we have 

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X, LConst \mathcal{S})
  \simeq
  Func(\Pi(X), \mathcal{S})
  \,.
$$

This means that local systems are naturally identified with [[representation]]s ($\infty$-[[permutation representation]]s, as it were) of the fundamental $\infty$-groupoid.

The [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over a [[locally contractible space]] is locally $\infty$-connected, and many authors identify local systems on such a topological space with representations of its [[fundamental groupoid]].

=--


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Given a local system $\tilde \nabla : X \to LConst \mathcal{S}$, the cohomology of $X$ with this **local system of coefficients** is 
the intrinsic [[cohomology]] of the [[over-(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}/X$:

  $$
    H(X,\tilde \nabla)
    :=
    \mathbf{H}_{/X}(X, P_{\tilde \nabla})
    \,,
  $$

where $P_{\tilde\nabla}$ is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\tilde \nabla$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Unwinding the definitions and using the universality of the [[(∞,1)-pullback]], one sees that a [[cocycle]] $c \in \mathbf{H}(X,\tilde \nabla)$ is a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{c}{\to}&& *
    \\
    & \searrow &\swArrow& \swarrow
    \\
    && LConst \mathcal{S}
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$. This is precisely a [[section]] of the [[locally constant ∞-stack]] $\tilde \nabla$.

### Sheaf-theoretic case

Local systems can also be considered in abelian contexts. One finds the following version of a local system

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A **linear local system** is a [[locally constant sheaf]] on a [[topological space]] $X$ (or manifold, analytic manifold, or algebraic variety) whose stalk is a finite-dimensional [[vector space]]. 

=--

Regarded as a sheaf $F$ with values in [[abelian group]]s, such a linear local system serves as the coefficient for [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]. As discussed there, this is in degree $n$ nothing but the intrinsic cohomology of the $\infty$-topos with coefficients in the [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]] $\mathbf{B}^n F$.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

On a connected topological space this is the same as a sheaf of sections of a finite-dimensional [[vector bundle]] equipped with flat [[connection on a bundle]]; and it also corresponds to the [[representations]] of the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ in the typical stalk. On an analytic manifold or a variety, there is an equivalence between the category of non-singular coherent 
$D_X$-[[D-module|modules]] and local systems on $X$.

* [[simplicial local system]]: within Sullivan's (1977) theory of _Infinitesimal computations in topology_, he refers to 'local systems' several times. This seems to be simplicial in nature.
