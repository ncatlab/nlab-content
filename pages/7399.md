##Idea

>A _dessin d'enfant_ (French for a "child's drawing", plural ''dessins d'enfants'', "children's drawings") is a type of [[graph drawing]] used to study [[Riemann surface]]s and to provide combinatorial [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] for the action of the [[absolute Galois group]] of the [[rational number]]s.

>''Intuitively, a dessin d'enfant is simply a [[undirected graph|graph]], with its [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] colored alternating black and white, [[graph embedding|embedded]] onto an [[Orientability|oriented surface]] that, in many cases, is simply a [[plane]]. For the coloring to exist, the graph must be [[bipartite graph|bipartite]]. The faces of the embedding must be topological disks. The surface and the embedding may be described combinatorially using a [[rotation system]], a [[cyclic order]] of the edges surrounding each vertex of the graph that describes the order in which the edges would be crossed by a path that travels clockwise on the surface in a small loop around the vertex. Any dessin can provide the surface it is embedded on with a structure as a Riemann surface. It natural to ask which Riemann surfaces arise in this way. The answer is provided by [[Belyi's theorem]], which states that these are precisely those that can be defined over the field of algebraic numbers (when considered as algebraic curves). The absolute Galois group transforms these particular curves into each other, and thereby also transforms the underlying dessins.'' (wikipedia)

## Definition

###### Definition

A dessin d’enfants is a bipartite connected graph $G$ which is 
embedded into an orientable closed topological surface $X$ , such that it ﬁlls the 
surface, i.e. $X \setminus G$ is a union of open cells. Two dessins d’enfants $(X_1 , G_1 )$ and $(X_2 , G_2 )$ are called equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism $f : X_1 \to X_2$ 
such that $f (G_1 ) = G_2$ .
