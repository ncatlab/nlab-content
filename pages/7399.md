## Idea and prehistory

It is an old result that any (finite) [[graph]] can be embedded in an orientable surface. (The result can be found, for instance in [White 1984](#White1984), in which he give an algorithm, calling it the Edmonds algorithm and giving a date of 1960, (see [Edmonds 1960](#Edmonds1960)).)

In 1879 Felix Klein (see [Klein's dessins d'enfants](#KleinsDessins)) in his paper "Über die Transformationen elfter Ordnung der elliptischen Funktionen" ("On the transformations of order eleven of elliptic functions" ) classified some Riemann surfaces of a certain ramification type by associating to covers of the surface with certain [[monodromy]] group their "dessins d'enfants" which he called "Linienzüge".

The modern perception of dessins d'enfants begins with [[Grothendieck]], who showed how to describe, categorically, the geometric structure corresponding to such embedded graphs, namely by the action of a certain 'cartographic group' on sets.  His motivation was the way in which this shed light on the structure of Riemann surfaces, and through that to the [[absolute Galois group]] $G$ of the rational numbers. The technical vehicle explicating this relation is Belyi's theorem from which follows that $G$ has a faithful [[action]] on Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants.


>A _dessin d'enfant_ (French for a "child's drawing", plural "dessins d'enfants", ''children's drawings") is a type of [[graph]] drawing used to study [[Riemann surface]]s and to provide combinatorial [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] for the action of the [[absolute Galois group]] of the [[rational number]]s.

>''Intuitively, a dessin d'enfant is simply a [[undirected graph|graph]], with its [[vertex|vertices]] colored alternating black and white, [[graph embedding|embedded]] onto an [[Orientability|oriented surface]] that, in many cases, is simply a [[plane]]. For the coloring to exist, the graph must be [[bipartite graph|bipartite]]. The faces of the embedding must be topological disks. The surface and the embedding may be described combinatorially using a [[rotation system]], a [[cyclic order]] of the edges surrounding each vertex of the graph that describes the order in which the edges would be crossed by a path that travels clockwise on the surface in a small loop around the vertex. Any dessin can provide the surface it is embedded on with a structure as a Riemann surface. It natural to ask which Riemann surfaces arise in this way. The answer is provided by [[Belyi's theorem]], which states that these are precisely those that can be defined over the field of algebraic numbers (when considered as algebraic curves). The absolute Galois group transforms these particular curves into each other, and thereby also transforms the underlying dessins.'' (wikipedia)



The original development does not, however, explicitly use bipartite graphs, rather it used a form of 1-complex, embedded in a surface (see below). The use of bipartite graphs simplifies the exposition.

## Definition

A _dessin d’enfant_ is a bipartite connected graph $G$ which is 
embedded into an orientable closed topological surface $X$, such that it ﬁlls the 
surface, i.e. $X \setminus G$ is a union of open cells. Two dessins d’enfants $(X_1 , G_1 )$ and $(X_2 , G_2 )$ are called _equivalent_ if there exists a homeomorphism $f : X_1 \to X_2$ 
such that $f (G_1 ) = G_2$ .

## Example

* An example for a bipartite (connected) graph is a [[tree category|tree]].

* It is well known that the bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ is non-planar, so does not embed in the 2-sphere, but will embed in the torus, in such a way that its complement is a disjoint union of discs.


##Remark

The original work  was stated in terms of objects called [[cellular maps]], and the category of these cellular maps and isotopy classes of morphisms between them was shown to correspond to a category of finite $\mathbb{G}$-sets where $\mathbb{G}$ is a group called the [[cartographic group]], which has a simple presentation in terms of operations of a geometric /  combinatorial nature. )



## A translated extract 

(from the [[Esquisse d'un programme]] describing the idea as seen by Grothendieck:)


''My interest in topological surfaces began to appear in 1974, when I proposed to Yves Ladegaillerie the theme of the isotopic study of embeddings 
of a topological 1-complex into a compact surface. Over the two following 
years, this study led him to a remarkable isotopy theorem, giving a complete algebraic description of the isotopy classes of embeddings of such 
1-complexes, or compact surfaces with boundary, in a compact oriented 
surface, in terms of certain very simple combinatorial invariants, and the 
fundamental groups of the protagonists. This theorem, which should be 
easily generalisable to embeddings of any compact space (triangulable to 
simplify) in a compact oriented surface, gives as easy corollaries several 
deep classical results in the theory of surfaces, and in particular Baer’s isotopy theorem. 

 In the work of Ladegaillerie there is also a purely algebraic description, in terms 
of fundamental groups, of the ''isotopic'' category of compact surfaces X , 
equipped with a topological 1-complex K embedded in X . This description, 
which had the misfortune to run counter to ''today’s taste'' and because of 
this appears to be unpublishable, nevertheless served (and still serves) as a 
precious guide in my later reflections, particularly in the context of absolute 
algebraic geometry in characteristic zero. ''
