__$Frm$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[frames]] and whose [[morphisms]] are frame [[homomorphisms]], that is [[functions]] which preserve all [[joins]] (including the [[bottom element]]) and finitary [[meets]] (equivalently, binary meets and the [[top element]]).  $Frm$ is a [[subcategory]] of [[Pos]], in fact a [[replete subcategory]] of both [[DistLat]] and [[SupLat]].

The [[opposite category]] of $Frm$ is the category [[Loc]] of [[locales]]; this is an example of the duality between [[space and quantity]].


## Free frames

$Frm$ is given by a [[variety of algebras]], or equivalently by an [[algebraic theory]], so it is an [[equationally presented category]]; however, it requires operations of arbitrarily large arity.  Nevertheless, it is a [[monadic category]] (over [[Set]]), because it has [[free objects]].  Specifically, the __free frame__ on a [[set]] $X$ is the lattice of [[upper subsets]] of the [[free join-semilattice]] on $X$, that is $\mathcal{U}\mathcal{P}_{fin}X$.

(This construction is [[constructive mathematics|constructively valid]], but it does not go through in [[predicative mathematics]], where infinite frames are generally [[proper class|large]] objects.)

Note that free frames are quite different from free [[locales]] (which are [[discrete spaces]] from a localic perspective).
