## Idea

A _complete Segal space_ is a [[category object in an (∞,1)-category|category object]] in [[∞Grpd]] (a [[Segal space]] is a [[pre-category object in an (∞,1)-category|pre-category object]]).

Hence complete Segal spaces are models for [[(∞,1)-categories]].

More explicitly, the rough idea is that a complete Segal space is the [[nerve]] of a [[enriched category|category enriched]] [[homotopical enrichment|weakly]] over [[Top]]/[[sSet]]: it is not a [[simplicial set]], but a simplicial [[topological space]] or [[bisimplicial set]] that satisfies the [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] analog of the condition that otherwise implies that a [[simplicial set]] is the [[nerve]] of a [[category]].

A bit more precisely: to determine if a [[simplicial set]] $X_\bullet$ arises from a [[category]] by passing to its [[nerve]] one has to check the **Segal condition**s: that for all natural numbers $m,n$ the square

$$
  \array{
    X_{m+n} 
     &
      \stackrel{p^*_{0,\cdots, m}}{\to}
     & 
     X_m
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p^*_{m, \cdots, m+n}}}\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p^*_m}}
    \\
    X_n &\stackrel{\quad p^*_0\quad}{\to}& X_0
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] square in [[Set]] (where the maps $p^*_{\cdots}$ project out the indicated parts of the objects of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ regarded as [[posets]]). $X^\bullet$ is the [[nerve]] of a [[category]] precisely if this is the case for all $n, m$.

This condition is internalized homotopically in the category of spaces to get the definition of a _[[Segal space]]_.  One can interpret "spaces" here as meaning either (sufficiently [[nice category of spaces|nice]]) [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]]; in the latter case a Segal space is a particular sort of [[bisimplicial set]].

###### Definition

A **Segal space** $X_\bullet$
  is a simplicial [[nice topological space]]/[[simplicial set]]
  $X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ which is [[Reedy model structure|Reedy fibrant]] and for which for all $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ the square

$$
  \array{
    X_{m+n} &\stackrel{
      p^*_{0,\cdots, m}
    }{\to}& X_m
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p^*_{m, \cdots, m+n}}}\downarrow 
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p^*_m}}
    \\
    X_n &\stackrel{p^*_0}{\to}& X_0
  }
$$

is a [[homotopy pullback]] square in [[Top]]/[[sSet]].

Next, the idea is that, roughly,
a Segal space $X_\bullet$ is a **complete Segal space** if the the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X_0$ is the maximal topological groupoid contained in the topologically enriched category of which $X_\bullet$ is like the nerve of.
