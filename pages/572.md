## Idea

A _complete Segal space_ is a [[internal category in an (∞,1)-category]] in [[∞Grpd]], with the latter [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by [[sSet]]/[[Top]]. Complete Segal spaces are a model for [[(∞,1)-categories]].

More in detail, a complete Segal space $X$ is

* for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[Kan complex]] $X_n$, thought of as the _space of composable sequences of $n$-morphisms and their composites_;

* forming a [[simplicial object]] $X_\bullet$ in [[sSet]] (a [[bisimplicial set]]);

such that

1. there is a [[composition]] operation well defined up to [[coherence|coherent]] [[homotopy]]: exibited by the canonical morphisms

   $$
     X_k \to X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1
   $$

   (into the iterated [[homotopy pullback]] of the [[∞-groupoid]] of 1-morphisms over the $\infty$-groupoid of objects) being [[homotopy equivalences]]

   (so far this defines a _[[Segal space]]_);

1. the notion of equivalence in $X_\bullet$ is compatible with that in the ambient [[∞Grpd]] ("completeness"): the sub-simplicial object $Core(X_\bullet)$ on the invertible morphisms in each degree has all face and degeneracy maps being homotopy equivalences.


## Properties

### Model category structure

The category $[\Delta^{op}, sSet]$ of [[simplicial presheaves]] on the [[simplex category]] ([[bisimplicial sets]]) supports a [[model category]] structure whose fibrant objects are precisely the complete Segal spaces: the _[[model structure for complete Segal spaces]]_. This presents the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

## Examples

### Ordinary categories as complete Segal spaces
 {#OrdinaryCategoriesAsCompleteSegalSpaces}

We discuss how an ordinary [[small category]] is naturally regarded as a complete Segal space.
([Rezk, 3.5](#Rezk))

#### Preliminaries

We need the following basic ingredients.

Write $(-)^{(-)} : Cat^{op} \times Cat \to Cat$ for the [[internal hom]] in [[Cat]], sending two categories $A$, $X$ to the [[functor category]] $X^A = Func(A,X)$.

By the discussion at [[nerve]] we have a canonical functor

$$
  \Delta \hookrightarrow Cat
$$

including the [[simplex category]] into [[Cat]] by regarding the [[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$ as the category generated from $n$ consecutive morphisms.

The [[nerve]] itself is then then functor

$$
  N : Cat \to sSet
$$

to [[sSet]] sending a category $C$ to 

$$
  N(C) : k \mapsto C^{\Delta[k]}
  \,.
$$

Its restriction along $Grpd \hookrightarrow Cat$ to [[groupoids]] lands in [[Kan complexes]] $KanCplx \hookrightarrow $ [[sSet]].

The [[core]] operation is the functor

$$
  Core : Cat \to Grpd
$$

[[right adjoint]] to the inclusion of [[Grpd]] into [[Cat]]. It sends a category to the groupoid obtained by discarding all non-invertible morphisms.

#### The construction

Let $C$ be a [[small category]]. Define 

$$
  \mathbf{C} \in [\Delta^{op}, sSet]
$$

by

$$
  \mathbf{C}_k := N(Core(C^{\Delta[k]}))  
  \,.
$$

In degree 0 this is the the [[core]] of $C$ itself. In degree 1 it is the groupoid $\mathbf{C}_1$ underlying the [[arrow category]] of $C$. 

One sees that the [[source]] and [[target]] functors $s, t : C^{\Delta[1]} \to C$ are [[isofibrations]] and hence their image under [[core]] and [[nerve]] are [[Kan fibrations]]. Therefore it follows that the [[homotopy pullback]] (see there) $\mathbf{C}_1 \times_{\mathbf{C}_0} \cdots \times_{\mathbf{C}_0} \mathbf{C}_1$ is given already be the ordinary pullback in the 1-category [[Grpd]]. Using this, it is immediate that for all $k$ the functors

$$
  Core(C^{\Delta[k]}) \to Core(C^{\Delta[1]}) \times_{Core(C)} \cdots \times_{Core(C)} Core(C^{\Delta[1]}) 
$$

are [[isomorphisms]], and so in particular 

$$
  \mathbf{C}_k 
   \to 
  \mathbf{C}_1 \times_{\mathbf{C}_0} \cdots \times_{\mathbf{C}_0} \mathbf{C}_1
$$

is an equivalence. 

It is clear that the composition operation defined this way "is" the composition in $C$. In particular the morphisms that are invertibel under this composition are precisely those that are already invertible in $C$. Therefore we have the core simplicial object

$$
  Core(\mathbf{C}) : k \mapsto N(Core(C)^{\Delta[k]})
   = N(Core(C))^{\Delta[k]}
  \,,
$$

where, note, now we _first_ take the core of $C$ and then form morphism categories. 

This simplicial Kan complex has in each positive degree a [[path space object]] for the [[Kan complex]] $N(Core(C))$.

Notably (since $\Delta[k]$ is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weak homotopy equivalent]] to the point) it follows that indeed all the face and degeneracy maps are weak homotopy equivalences.

So for every category $C$, the simplicial object $\mathbf{C}$ constructed as above is a complete Segal space. This constructions extends to a functor $Cat \to completeSegalSpace$ and this is homotopy full and faithful.

#### Properties of the inclusion
 {#PropertiesOfTheInclusionOfCategories}
 

Write

$$
 Sing_J : Cat \to [\Delta^{op}, sSet]
$$

for the functor just defined

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ and $D$ two categories, there are [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$
  Sing_J(C \times D)
  \simeq
  Sing_J(C) \times Sing_J(D)
$$

and

$$
  Sing_J(D^C) \simeq (Sing_J D)^{Sing_J C}
  \,.
$$

A functor $f : C \to D$ is an [[equivalence of categories]] precisely if $Sing_J(f)$ is an equivalence in the [[Reedy model structure]] $[\Delta^{op}, sSet]_{Reedy}$ (hence is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of Kan complexes).

This appears as ([Rezk, theorem 3.7](#Rezk)).
