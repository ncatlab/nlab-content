## Idea

The _partition function_ is a certain assignment that may be extracted from a system in [[statistical mechanics]], or in [[quantum field theory]]. If the quantum field theory $Z$ is presented as an [[FQFT]], that is, as a [[functor]] on a category of $d$-dimensional [[cobordism]]s, then the partition function is the assignment to $d$-dimensional [[torus|tori]] $T$ of the values $Z(T)$ assigned to these by the QFT.

By the axioms of functoriality and symmetric monoidalness of a QFT, this means that the partition function is the [[trace]] over the value of the QFT in the cylinder obtained by cutting the torus open.

This is where the partition function originally derives its name from: typically for QFTs on _[[Riemannian metric|Riemannian]]_ [[cobordism]]s the  value of the QFT on a cylinder of _length_ $t$ is a [[linear operator]] of the form $\exp(- t H)$ for some operator $H$.

## Origin of the term 

When one thinks of the QFT --- under [[Wick rotation]] --- as describing a physical system in [[statistical mechanics]], then the vector space that $H$ acts on is the vector space of all states of the system and $H$ is the operator whose eigenstates are the states of definite energy. The expression

$$
  tr(exp(-t H))
$$

then is interpreted as 

> sum over all states $\Psi$ of the system and weigh each one by its energy $E_\Psi$.

This involves, conversely, counting for each fixed energy $E_\Psi$ the number of states of that energy. This will typically be a sum over certain partitions of various particles of an ensemble into various "bins" of partial energies. Therefore the term _partition_ function.

In fact, the common letter $Z$ uses to denote QFTs (or at least [[TQFT]]s) also derives from this: in German the partition function is called _Zustandssumme_ --- from German _Zustand_ for "state" .

The [[Mellin transform]] of the partition function is known in [[quantum field theory]] as the [[Schwinger parameter]]-formulation which takes the [[worldline theory]] to its [[zeta function regularization|zeta regulated]] [[Feynman propagator]].

## Examples 

Partition function for the [[superparticle]]: [[K-theory]] [[index]].

Partition function for the [[type II superstring]]: [[elliptic genus]].

Partition function for the [[heterotic string]]: [[Witten genus]].
