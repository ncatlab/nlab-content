## Idea

Yang--Mills theory is a [[gauge theory]] on a given 4-[[dimensional]] ([[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[manifold]] $X$ whose field is the [[Yang–Mills field]] -- a cocycle $\nabla \in \mathbf{H}(X,\bar \mathbf{B}U(n))$ in differential [[nonabelian cohomology]] represented by a [[vector bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] -- and whose [[action functional]] is 

$$
  \nabla \mapsto
  \frac{1}{e^2 }\int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla  + i \theta \int_X F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla
$$

for 

* $F_\nabla$ the [[field strength]], locally the [[curvature]] $\mathfrak{u}(n)$-[[Lie algebra valued differential form]] on $X$ ( with $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$);

* $\star$ the [[Hodge star]] operator of the metric  $g$;

* $\frac{1}{e^2}$ and $\theta$ some [[real number]]s (see [[S-duality]])

## Applications

All gauge fields in the [[standard model of particle physics]] as well as in [[GUT]] models are Yang--Mills fields.

The matter fields in the standard model are spinors charged under the Yang-Mills field. See

* [[spinors in Yang-Mills theory]]
