Yang-Mills theory is a [[gauge theory]] on 4-dimensional (pseudo)Riemannian [[manifold]] $X$ whose field is the [[Yang-Mills field]] -- a cocycle $\hat F \in \mathbf{H}(X,\bar \mathbf{B}U(n))$ in differential [[nonabelian cohomology]] represented by a [[vector bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] -- and whose [[action functional]] is 

$$
  \hat F \mapsto
  \int_X F \wedge \star F  + \theta \int_X F \wedge F
$$

for some real number $\theta$.

All gauge fields in the [[standard model of particle physics]] as well as in [[GUT]] models are Yang-Mills fields.
