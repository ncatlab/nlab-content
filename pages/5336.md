# Introduction

The Russian school of [[constructive mathematics]], associated principally with [[Andrey Markov Jr]], was (is?) a variety of constructive mathematics focussing on [[recursion theory]].

# Principles and results

*  Classically true principles:
   *  [[Markov's principle]] for [[natural numbers]]: if an [[infinite sequence]] of [[binary digits]] is not all $0$, then it has a least one $1$;
   *  [[dependent choice]].
* Classically false principles:
  *  every [[partial function]] from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ is [[computable function|computable]];
  *  every set is a [[subquotient]] of $\mathbb{N}$.
* Classically false results:
  *  every [[total function]] from $\mathbb{R}$ (the [[real line]]) to $\mathbb{R}$ is pointwise [[continuous function|continuous]] ([[Ceitin's theorem]]);
  *  there exist continuous functions from $[0,1]$ (the [[unit interval]]) to $\mathbb{R}$ that are pointwise continuous but not [[uniformly continuous map|uniformly continuous]];
  *  there exist [[bounded subspace|bounded]] sets of real numbers with no [[supremum]] (given by [[Specker sequence]]s).
