A **Poisson Lie group** (often written Poisson-Lie group) or Lie Poisson group is a [[group object]] in the category of [[Poisson manifolds]]. In other words the group product and inverse are smooth maps of Poisson manifolds where $G\times G$ has the product Poisson structure. 

If $H$ is any (finite dimensional) Lie group then the dual $(T_e H)^*$ of its [[tangent Lie algebra]] has a canonical bracket introduced by Kirillov which makes it into a Poisson Lie group. To this aim one identifies $(T_e H)^*$ with its own tangent space $T_u (T_e H)^*$ and interprets the differential $df$ of a function $f:(T_e H)^*\to \mathbb{R}$ as a function $(T_e H)^*\to ((T_e H)^*)^*\cong T_e H$ where the finite dimensionality is used. Then Kirillov defines

$$
\lbrace f_1, f_2\rbrace (u) = \langle [(df_1)_u, (df_2)_u, u\rangle
$$

Given two Lie groups $H,K$, the Lie algebra homomorphisms $T_e H \to T_e K$ are in 1-1 correspondence with the Poisson Lie maps $(T_e K)^* \to (T_e H)^*$. 

Deformation quantizations of Poisson Lie groups are Hopf algebras. The usual [[quantum groups]] have smaller number of quantum subgroups (i.e. Hopf quotient algebras) than the corresponding Lie group has, namely only only those whose classical limits are not only Lie subgroups but Poisson Lie subgroups.
