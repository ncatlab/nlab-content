###### Definition

An **algebraic lattice** is a [[lattice]] which is

* a [[complete lattice]];

* such that every element is a [[join]] of [[compact elements]].

=--


An __algebraic lattice__ is a [[complete lattice]] (equivalently, a [[suplattice]], or in different words a [[poset]] with the [[extra property|property]] of having arbitrary [[colimits]] but with the [[structure]] of [[directed colimits]]/[[directed joins]]) in which every element is the [[supremum]] of the [[compact element]]s below it (an element $e$ is compact if, for every subset $S$ of the lattice, $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of $S$ just in case $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of some finite subset of $S$). 

Here is an alternative formulation: 
+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
An algebraic lattice is a [[poset]] which is [[locally finitely presentable category|locally finitely presentable]] as a category. 
=-- 

This formulation suggests useful a way of viewing algebraic lattices in terms 
of [[Gabriel-Ulmer duality]] (but with regard to enrichment in [[truth values]], instead of in $Set$). 

## Properties

### The category of algebraic lattices

The [[morphisms]] most commonly considered between algebraic lattices are the [[finitary functors]] between them, which is to say, the [[Scott topology|Scott-continuous]] functions between them; i.e., those functions which preserve directed joins (hence the parenthetical remarks [above](#Def)). 

The resulting category __AlgLat__ is [[cartesian closed]] and is dually equivalent to the category whose objects are [[meet semilattices]] (construed as categories with [[finite limits]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[truth values]]) and whose morphisms are meet-preserving [[profunctors]] between them (using the convention that a $V$-enriched profunctor from $C$ to $D$ is a functor $D^{op} \times C \rightarrow V$; of course, with an opposite convention, one could similarly state a covariant equivalence). 

The category of [[topological spaces]] is the [[stuff, structure, property|2-image]] of the projection from the [[comma category]] $(Set / Forgetful)$ to $Set$, where $Forgetful : AlgLat \rightarrow Set$ is the obvious forgetful functor. This connection is explored in more depth with the category of [[equilogical spaces]], equivalent to both a category of [[equivalence relation|partial equivalence relations]] over $AlgLat$, and of total [[equivalence relations]] on $T_0$ topological spaces.



### Completely distributive lattices

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


The category of [[Alexandroff locales]] is equivalent to that of [[completely distributive lattice|completely distributive]] algebraic lattices. 
=--

This appears as ([Caramello, remark 4.3](#Caramello)).

The [[completely distributive lattice|completely distributive]] algebraic lattices form a [[reflective subcategory]] of that of all distributive lattices. The reflector is called _[[canonical extension]]_.
