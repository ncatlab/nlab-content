## Definition

An __algebraic lattice__ is a [[complete lattice]] (or perhaps rather a [[suplattice]]? Or a [[poset]] with the [[extra property|property]] of arbitrary [[colimits]] but only the [[structure]] of [[directed colimits]]/[[directed joins]]? Anyway, it has arbitrary [[joins]], whatever the morphisms should be) in which every element is the [[supremum]] of the [[compact element]]s below it (an element $e$ is compact if, for every subset $S$ of the lattice, $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of $S$ just in case $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of some finite subset of $S$).

The morphisms most commonly considered between algebraic lattices are the [[finitary functor]]s between them, which is to say, the [[Scott topology|Scott-continuous]] functions between them; i.e., those functions which preserve directed joins (hence the parenthetical remarks before). The resulting category __AlgLat__ is [[cartesian closed]] and is dually equivalent to the category whose objects are [[meet semilattices]] (construed as categories with finite limits [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[truth values]]) and whose morphisms are meet-preserving [[profunctors]] between them (using the convention that a $V$-enriched profunctor from $C$ to $D$ is a functor $D^{op} \times C \rightarrow V$; of course, with an opposite convention, one could similarly state a covariant equivalence). The category of [[topological spaces]] is the [[stuff, structure, property|2-image]] of the projection from the [[comma category]] $(Set / Forgetful)$ to $Set$, where $Forgetful : AlgLat \rightarrow Set$ is the obvious forgetful functor. This connection is explored in more depth with the category of [[equilogical space]]s, equivalent to both a category of [[partial equivalence relation]]s over $AlgLat$, and of total equivalence relations on $T_0$ topological spaces.
