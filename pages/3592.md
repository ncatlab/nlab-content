###### Definition

An **algebraic lattice** is a [[lattice]] which is

* a [[complete lattice]];

* such that every element is a [[join]] of [[compact elements]].

=--


An __algebraic lattice__ is a [[complete lattice]] (equivalently, a [[suplattice]], or in different words a [[poset]] with the [[extra property|property]] of having arbitrary [[colimits]] but with the [[structure]] of [[directed colimits]]/[[directed joins]]) in which every element is the [[supremum]] of the [[compact element]]s below it (an element $e$ is compact if, for every subset $S$ of the lattice, $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of $S$ just in case $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of some finite subset of $S$). 

Here is an alternative formulation: 
+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
An algebraic lattice is a [[poset]] which is [[locally finitely presentable category|locally finitely presentable]] as a category. 
=-- 

This formulation suggests useful a way of viewing algebraic lattices in terms 
of [[Gabriel-Ulmer duality]] (but with regard to enrichment in [[truth values]], instead of in $Set$). 

As this last formulation suggests, algebraic lattices typically arise as [[subobject lattices]] for objects in locally finitely presentable categories. As an example, for any (finitary) [[Lawvere theory]] $T$, the subobject lattice of an object in $T$-$Alg$ is an algebraic lattice (this class of examples explains the origin of the term "algebraic lattice", which is due to Garrett Birkhoff). 

## Properties

### The category of algebraic lattices

The [[morphisms]] most commonly considered between algebraic lattices are the [[finitary functors]] between them, which is to say, the [[Scott topology|Scott-continuous]] functions between them; i.e., those functions which preserve directed joins (hence the parenthetical remarks [above](#Def)). 

The resulting category __AlgLat__ is [[cartesian closed]] and is dually equivalent to the category whose objects are [[meet semilattices]] (construed as categories with [[finite limits]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[truth values]]) and whose morphisms are meet-preserving [[profunctors]] between them (using the convention that a $V$-enriched profunctor from $C$ to $D$ is a functor $D^{op} \times C \rightarrow V$; of course, with an opposite convention, one could similarly state a covariant equivalence). 

There is a _full_ [[full embedding|embedding]] 

$$i \colon AlgLat \to Top_0$$ 

to the category of $T_0$-[[separation axioms|spaces]], taking an algebraic lattice $L$ to the space whose points are elements of $L$, and whose [[open sets]] $U$ are defined by the property that their [[characteristic maps]] 

$$\chi_U: L \to \mathbf{2}$$ 

($\chi_U(a) = 1$ if $a \in U$, else $\chi_U(a) = 0$) are poset maps that preserve [[directed colimits]]. The [[specialization order]] of $i(L)$ is $L$ again. 

Every $T_0$-space $X$ occurs as a [[subspace]] of some space $i(L)$ associated with an algebraic lattice. Explicitly, let $L(X)$ be the [[power set]] of the underlying set of the [[topology]], $P{|\mathcal{O}(X)|}$, and define 

$$X \to (i\circ L)(X)$$ 

to take $x$ to $N(x) \coloneqq \{U \in \mathcal{O}(X): x \in U\}$. This gives a topological embedding of $X$ in $i(L(X))$. 

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark 
On similar grounds, if $U \colon AlgLat \to Set$ is the forgetful functor, then the [2-image](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stuff%2C+structure%2C+property#a_factorisation_system_14) of the projection functor $\pi \colon Set\downarrow U \to Set$ is the category of topological spaces $Top$. In more nuts-and-bolts terms, an object $(S, L, f \colon S \to U(L))$ gives a space with underlying set $S$ and open sets those of the form $f^{-1}(O)$, where $O$ ranges over the Scott topology on $L$. Notice that if $(f \colon S \to S', g \colon L \to L')$ is a morphism in $Set \downarrow U$, then $f$ is continuous with respect to these topologies. Therefore the projection $\pi \colon Set \downarrow U \to Set$ factors through the faithful forgetful functor $Top \to Set$. Thus, working in the factorization system (eso+full, faithful) on $Cat$, we have a faithful functor $2$-$im(\pi) \to Top$ filling in as the diagonal 

$$\array{
Set \downarrow U & \to & Top \\
\downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow \\
2\text{-}im(\pi) & \to & Set.
}$$ 

But notice also that $Set \downarrow U \to Top$ is [eso and full](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ternary+factorization+system#examples_9). It is eso because any topology $\mathcal{O}(S)$ on $S$ can be reconstituted from the triple $(S, P{|\mathcal{O}(S)|}, x \mapsto N(x) \colon S \to P{|\mathcal{O}(S)|})$. We claim it is full as well. For, every continuous map $X \to X'$ between topological spaces induces a continuous map between their $T_0$ reflections $X_0 \to X_{0}'$, and since algebraic lattices like $P{|\mathcal{O}(X)|}$ (being continuous lattices) are [[injective objects]] in the category of $T_0$ spaces, we are able to complete to a diagram 

$$\array{
X & \to & X_0 & \to & P{|\mathcal{O}(X)|} \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
X' & \to & X_{0}' & \to & P{|\mathcal{O}(X')|}
}$$ 

where the rightmost vertical arrow is Scott-continuous (and the horizontal composites are of the form $x \mapsto N(x)$). Finally, since $Set \downarrow U \to Top$ is eso and full, it follows that $2$-$im(\pi) \to Top$ is eso, full, and faithful, and therefore an equivalence of categories. 

This connection is explored in more depth with the category of [[equilogical spaces]], which can be seen either as a category of (set-theoretic) [[equivalence relation|partial equivalence relations]] over $AlgLat$, or equivalently of (set-theoretic) total [[equivalence relations]] on $T_0$ topological spaces.

### Relation to locally finitely presentable categories 

One of our definitions of algebraic lattice is: a poset $L$ which is locally finitely presentable when viewed as a category. The completeness of $L$ means that right adjoints $L \to Set$ are representable, given by $L(p, -) \colon L \to Set$, and we are particularly interested in those representable functors that preserve [[filtered colimits]]. These correspond precisely to finitely presentable objects $p$, which in lattice theory are usually called compact elements. These compact elements are closed under finite joins. 

By Gabriel-Ulmer duality, $L$ is determined from the join-semilattice of compact elements $K$ by $L \cong Lex(K^{op}, Set)$. Since the elements of $K^{op}$ are subterminal, we can also write $L \cong Lex(K^{op}, 2)$ where $2 = Sub(1)$.

###### Theorem (Porst) 
If $C$ is a [[locally finitely presentable category]] and $X$ is an object of $C$, then 

* The lattice of subobjects $Sub(X)$, 

* The lattice of quotient objects (equivalence classes of epis sourced at $X$) $Quot(X)$, 

* The lattice of congruences (internal equivalence relations) on $X$ 

are all algebraic lattices.

### Completely distributive lattices

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


The category of [[Alexandroff locales]] is equivalent to that of [[completely distributive lattice|completely distributive]] algebraic lattices. 
=--

This appears as ([Caramello, remark 4.3](#Caramello)).

The [[completely distributive lattice|completely distributive]] algebraic lattices form a [[reflective subcategory]] of that of all distributive lattices. The reflector is called _[[canonical extension]]_.
