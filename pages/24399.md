## Overview

*[LOOPS'22](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1100970/)* is a [[theoretical physics]] conference held in Lyon, France between 18 July and 22 July 2022. This conference consists of a variety of subjects at the frontier of theoretical physics, such as [[cosmology]], [[holography]], [[black hole]] physics, [[loop quantum gravity]], and other topics in [[quantum field theory]] and [[quantum gravity]]. The website for this conference could be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1100970/).
