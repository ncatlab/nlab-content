## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every [[CW-complex]] is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]].

=--

For a textbook explanation, see e.g. [Fritsch-Piccinini 90, theorem 1.3.5](#FritschPiccinini90). Below we describe a somewhat more categorically minded approach. 

### CW-complexes are Hausdorff and normal

+-- {: .num_prop #CWComplexesAreNormal}
###### Proposition

Every [[CW-complex]] is a [[Hausdorff space]], in fact a [[normal topological space]].

=--

The proof is broken down in two parts. The first is that each $n$-skeleton $X_n$ of a CW-complex $X$ is normal (throughout we use "normal" to mean normal and Hausdorff), and that the inclusion $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n$ is a closed embedding. The second is that the colimit 

$$X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \ldots$$ 

of the sequence of skeleta and inclusions between them is again normal. 

We give just a sketch of the argument here; for full details see _[[colimits of normal spaces]]_. 

* A basic lemma is that the pushout in $Top$ of a closed embedding $i: X \to Z$ along any map $f: X \to Y$ is again a closed embedding, $j: Y \to Y \cup_X Z$. 

* Recall that a space $W$ is normal iff for any closed subspace $C \subseteq W$ and continuous function $f: C \to \mathbb{R}$, there is a continuous extension of $f$ to a map $g: W \to \mathbb{R}$. This may be exploited to give a simple proof of the following result: if $Y, Z$ are normal and $X \hookrightarrow Z$ is a closed subspace, then given a continuous map $f: X \to Y$, the space $W$ in the 
topological pushout diagram 
$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\hookrightarrow} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 
is also normal. Sketch of proof: if $C \subseteq W$ is closed and $\phi: C \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, first extend the evident map $k^{-1}(C) \to \mathbb{R}$ to a map $\beta: Y \to \mathbb{R}$, and similarly extend a suitable map $h(X) \cup g^{-1}(C) \to \mathbb{R}$ to a map $\theta: Z \to \mathbb{R}$, compatibly with $\beta$ so that the pair $(\beta, \theta)$ induces a map $\psi: W \to \mathbb{R}$ out of the pullback that restricts to $\phi: C \to \mathbb{R}$. 

* Assuming then that the $(n-1)$-skeleton $X_{n-1}$ is normal, and forming an adjunction space $X_n$ by attaching a collection of $n$-disks $\sum_{i \in I} D_i^n$ to $X_{n-1}$ by an attaching map $f: \sum_{i \in I} S_i^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$, it follows that the space $X_n$ is normal, and the embedding $X_{n-1} \to X_n$ is closed. 

* Finally, one proves without difficulty that the topological colimit of a sequence of normal spaces and closed embeddings between them is again normal. This applies in particular to the sequence of skeleta $X_n$ and the embeddings between them. 

### CW-complexes are paracompact

As a direct corollary of the above we obtain:

+-- {: .num_prop #CountableCWComplexesAreParacompact}
###### Proposition

CW-complexes with a [[countable set]] of cells are [[paracompact topological spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Each cell $D^{n}$ is a [[second-countable topological space]], and since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]] it follows that a CW-complex with a countable set of cells is second-countable.

By prop. \ref{CWComplexesAreNormal} it is also normal, hence in particular [[regular topological space|regular]]. Now the statement follows from the fact that [[second-countable regular spaces are paracompact]].

=-- 

However, the statement holds in full generality: 

+-- {: .num_prop #CWComplexesAreParacompact}
###### Proposition

CW-complexes (no restriction on the number of cells) are [[paracompact topological spaces]].

=-- 

The proof can again be broken down in two steps, parallel to the discussion after Proposition \ref{CWComplexesAreNormal}. The first is that each $n$-skeleton $X_n$ of a CW-complex $X$ is paracompact (throughout we use "paracompact" to mean paracompact and $T_1$; of course we know from Proposition \ref{CWComplexesAreNormal} that CW-complexes are Hausdorff), and that the inclusion $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n$ is a closed embedding. The second is that the colimit 

$$X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \ldots$$ 

of the sequence of skeleta and inclusions between them is again paracompact. 

The proofs for these two steps are pretty simple, once we have in hand a celebrated result from the 1950's: Ernest Michael's [[Michael's theorem|selection criterion]] for paracompactness. Thus there are some technical preliminaries that enter the full argument: 

* The [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity|proof]] that paracompactness of a space $X$ is equivalent to the statement that every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ admits a subordinate [[partition of unity]] (a result which requires some degree of [[axiom of choice|choice]]); 

* A convenient repackaging of the partition of unity result whereby a subordinate partition of unity is recast as a certain *continuous selection*: a continuous map $X \to L^1(\mathcal{U})$ included inside a suitably constructed [[entire relation]] $R \hookrightarrow X \times L^1(\mathcal{U})$. Abstracting away, the desired results thus involve considering maps $X = colim\; \mathbf{D} \to B$ out of a colimit of some diagram $\mathbf{D}$ of paracompact spaces into a Banach space $B$, and these boil down to [[cocones]] $\mathbf{D} \to B$ which are easily analyzed. 

More details can be found at [[colimits of paracompact spaces]].
