###### Lemma
**(cell attachment to Hausdorff space is still Hausdorff)**

Let $X$ be a [[Hausdorff space]] and let 

$$
  f \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \longrightarrow  X
$$

be a [[continuous function]]. Then also the [[attachment space]]

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_X}}
    \\
    D^n &\underset{i_{D^n}}{\longrightarrow}& X \cup_f D^n
  }
$$

is Hausdorff.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First we fix a way to extend open subsets of $S^{n-1}$ to open subsets of $D^n$. To that end, pick some real number $\epsilon$ with $0 \lt \epsilon \lt 1/2$. Then for $V \subset S^{n-1}$ an open subset of the sphere, let $C_\epsilon(V) \subset D^n$ be its open cone of height $\epsilon$ into the bulk of the $n$-disk, i.e. the set of points in $D^n$ of radial distance $\lt \epsilon$ from $V \subset S^{n-1} \subset D^n$. 

Observe 

1. A base of open neighbourhoods of $X \cup_f D^n$ is given by

   1. the images under $i_{D^n}$ of the open subsets of $D^n \setminus S^{n-1}$;

   1. the images under $i_X$ of the open subsets of $X \setminus f(S^{n-1})$;

   1. for $x \in S^{n-1}$ the union of the image under $i_X$ of an open neighbourhood $U_{f(x)} \subset X$ with the image under $i_{D^n}$ of the cone $C_\epsilon( f^{-1}(U_{f(x)}))$.

   These sets are open because their pre-images under $i_{D^n}$ and $i_X$ are open, by construction. They form a base because, again by construction, every point has a neighbourhood in this collection.

1. For every point $x \in X \setminus f(X) \subset X \subset X \cup_f D^n$ there exist disjoint open neighbourhoods around $f(S^{n-1})$ and $x$. 

   To see this, first find such open neighbourhoods in $X$. These exist because $S^{n-1}$ is a [[compact topological space]] (for instance by [[Heine-Borel theorem]]), since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] whence $f(S^{n-1}) \subset X$ is compact, and finally since [[compact subspaces in Hausdorff spaces are separated by neighbourhoods from points]]. Now form the union of the open neighbourhood of $f(S^{n-1})$ in $X$ with $C_\epsilon(S^{n-1})$ to obtain an open neighbourhood in $X \cup_f D^{n-1}$, still disjoint from that of the point.

Now we discuss separation of distinct points in $X \cup_f D^{n}$ by case distinction:

1. If $x \neq y \in D^n \setminus S^{n-1}$ then by the Hausdorffness of $D^n \setminus S^{n-1}$ there are disjoint open neighbourhoods $V_{x}, V_y \subset D^n \setminus S^{n-1}$ and their images under $i_{D^n}$ are still open and disjoint.

1. If $x \neq y \in X \setminus f(S^{n-1})$, then by the Hausdorffness of $X$ there are disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x, U_y \subset X$. By the second observation above we may moreover find open neighbourhoods $U'_x, U'_y \subset X$ that separate these points from $f(X)$. Hence $U_x \cap U'_x$ and $U_y \cap U'_y$ are disjoint open neighbourhoods in $X \setminus f(S^{n-1})$ whose image under $i_X$ remain disjoint open subsets in $X \cup_f D^{n-1}$.

1. If $x \neq y \in S^{n-1}$ with $f(x) \neq f(y)$ then pick disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x$, $U_y$ in $X$, which exist by the Hausdorffness of $X$. Their unions with $C_\epsilon(f^{-1}(U_x))$ and $C_\epsilon(f^{-1}(U_y))$, respectively, are disjoint open neighbourhoods in $X \cup_f D^n$.

1. If $x \in D^n \setminus S^{n-1}$ and $y \in X \setminus f(S^{n-1})$ under $i_X$ we may find an open ball around $x$ which does not intersect $S^{n-1}$ and, by the second observation above, an open neighbourhood of $y$ which does not intersect $f(X)$. The images of these in $X \cup_f D^n$ are of the required form. 

1. If $x \in S^{n-1}$ and $y \in X \setminus f(S^{n-1})$,  then by the second observation above we find disjoint open neighbourhoods of $f(S^{n-1})$ and of $y$ in $X$. The union of the former with $C_\epsilon(S^{n-1})$ gives disjoint open neighbourhoods in $X \cup_f D^n$ as required.

1. If $x \in D^n \setminus S^{n-1}$ and $y \in S^{n-1}$ let $d$ be the distance of the former to the boundary $S^{n-1}$ of $D^n$, pick the open ball of radius $d/2$ around that point. Then pick the enire rim of width $d/2$ as a neighbourhood for the point on the boundary. These are disjoint open neighbourhoods inside $D^n$ and by forming the union of the latter with all of $X$ they become disjoint open neighbourhoods in $X \cup_f D^n$.

###### Lemma
**(cell attachment to paracompact Hausdorff is still paracompact Hausdorff)**

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] and let 

$$
  \array{
     S^{n-1} &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_X}}

     D^n &\underset{i_{D^n}}{\longrightarrow}& X \cup_f D^n
  }
$$

be a [[cell attachment]]. Then also $X \cup_f D^n$ is paracompact Hausdorff.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Hausdorffness is the statement of lemma \ref{CellAttachmentToHausdorffSpaceIsHausdorff}.  We need to discuss paracompactness.

First we claim that both inclusion maps $D^n \to X \cup_f D^n$ and $X \to X \cup_f D^n$ are [[closed maps]]. To see this, recall that a subset of $X \cup_f D^n$ is closed precisely if its pre-images under both $i_X$ and $i_{D^n}$ are closed.

1. That $i_{D^n}$ is closed follows on abstract grounds since $D^n$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] (e.g. by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]]) and since $X \cup_f D^n$ is Hausdorff by lemma \ref{CellAttachmentToHausdorffSpaceIsHausdorff}, and since [[maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper]].

   More explicitly: It is sufficient to test on a base of closed subsets given by intersections of $D^n$ with other closed balls inside an ambient Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. If these intersections fall into the interior of the given $D^n$ then it is clear that their image is also closed. If instead they intersect the boundary $S^{n-1}$ then they do so in a closed point or a closed interval, in any case a compact subspace. We need to see that the image of that in $X$ is also closed in $X$. But this follows since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] and since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]].

1. That $i_X$ is closed follows on abstract grounds, since by construction it is the [[pushout]] of the closed map $S^{n-1} \to D^n$ and pushout preserves closed subspace inclusions by [this lemma](subspace+topology#pushout). (To see that $S^{n-1} \to D^n$ is a closed map observe that $S^{n-1} \subset D^n$ is a closed subspace and that [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]]).


   More explicitly: Consider a closed subset in $X$. Its image in $X \cup_f D^n$ has closed pre-image under $f$ in $S^{n-1}$ since $f$ is continuous. Now since $S^{n-1} \subset D^n$ is a closed subspace and since [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] if follows that this pre-image is also closed in $D^n$, hence it is closed in $X \cup_f D^n$. 

Now let $\{ U_i \subset X \cup_f D^n \}_{i \in I}$ be any open cover of the attachment space. We need to produce a locally finite refinement.

The pre-images of these open subsets in $D^n$ and in $X$ yield open covers $\{i_X^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ and $\{i_{D^n}^{-1}(U_i) \subset D^n\}_{i \in I}$ of these spaces. 

Now $X$ is paracompact Hausdorff by assumption and $D^n$ is paracompact Hausdorff by basic results (for instance use that [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]]). 

Hence by paracompactness of $X$ and $D^n$ there are locally finite refinements 

$$
  \{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J_X}
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  \{W_j \subset D^n\}_{j \in J_{D^n}}
$$

of these covers.
 
Since [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal]] we may apply the [[shrinking lemma]] to these to obtain further locally finite refinements 

$$
  V'_j \subset Cl(V'_j) \subset V_j
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  W'_j \subset Cl(W'_j) \subset W_j
$$

such that the [[topological closures]] of their patches are still contained in the original locally finite patches. 

Since the two inclusion maps are closed, by the above observation, 

> and we need that the $Cl(V'_j)$,  $Cl(W'_j)$ are (replaced by something) saturated... 

[this lemma](saturated+subset#FindSatureatedOpenInsideOpenNeighbourhood) says that we may find a locally finite cover intermediate to these two consisting of open [[saturated subsets]] $V^{sat}_j$ and $W^{sat}_j$:

$$
  V'_j \subset Cl(V'_j) \subset V^{sat}_j \subset V_j
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  W'_j \subset Cl(W'_j) \subset W^{sat}_j \subset W_j
$$

The images in $X \cup_f D^n$ of these saturated subsets are 

1. still open (by the nature of the [[final topology]], since saturated subsets are equal to the pre-images of their images) 

1. still locally finite (being composed of two locally finite sets of subsets) 

1. still a cover, by construction of the attachment space. 

Hence this is a locally finite refinement of the original cover, as required.

=--

A direct corollary of lemma \ref{CellAttachmentToParacompactHausdorffIsStillParacompactHausdorff} is that _finite_ CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff, and similarly that finite relative CW-complexes relative to paracompact Hausdorff spaces are paracompact Hausdorff.

For the non-finite case one needs a bit more...
