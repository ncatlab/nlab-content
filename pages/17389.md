## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every [[CW-complex]] is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]].

=--

For a textbook explanation, see e.g. [Fritsch-Piccinini 90, theorem 1.3.5](#FritschPiccinini90). Below we describe a somewhat more categorically minded approach. 

### Points are closed in CW-complexes 

+-- {: .num_lemma #CWComplexesAreT1}
###### Lemma 

Every [[CW-complex]] $X$ satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation property]] that [[singletons]] are [[closed subsets]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $X_n$ denote the $n^{th}$ skeleton of $X$. We argue by [[induction]] that each skeleton is $T_1$. Vacuously $X_{-1} = \emptyset$ is $T_1$. If $X_{n-1}$ is $T_1$, and $X_n$ is formed as an [[attachment space]] along a map $f: \sum_{i \in I} S_i^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$, so 

$$\array{
\sum_{i \in I} S_i^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \sum_{i \in I} D_i^{n-1} \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & po & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
X_{n-1} & \hookrightarrow & X_n
}$$ 

is a pushout square, then any point $x$ of $X_n$ either belongs to the closed subspace $X_{n-1}$ and is closed there by inductive hypothesis, and so is closed in $X_n$, or else $g^{-1}(x)$ is a singleton in the $T_1$ space $\sum_{i \in I} D_i^n$, so that $g^{-1}(x)$ is closed, making $\{x\}$ closed by definition of the [[pushout]] (as a [[quotient space]]). 

Then if $X = \bigcup_n X_n$ with the [[colimit]] topology and $x \in X$, each intersection $\{x\} \cap X_n$ is closed in $X_n$, so $\{x\}$ is closed in $X$ by definition of the colimit topology.

### CW-complexes are paracompact


+-- {: .num_prop #CWComplexesAreParacompact}
###### Proposition

CW-complexes are [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
First one proves that each $n$-skeleton $X_n$ is paracompact and Hausdorff, by an inductive argument. Here are the ingredients: 

* Spheres $S^{n-1}$ and disks $D^n$ are paracompact and Hausdorff since they are compact and Hausdorff, and coproducts of paracompact Hausdorff spaces are paracompact and Hausdorff. Hence 

More details can be found at [[colimits of paracompact spaces]].
