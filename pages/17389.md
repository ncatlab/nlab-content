### CW-complexes are Hausdorff and normal

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every [[CW-complex]] is a [[Hausdorff space]], in fact a [[normal topological space]].

=--

The proof is broken down in two parts. The first is that each $n$-skeleton $X_n$ of a CW-complex $X$ is normal (throughout we use "normal" to mean normal and Hausdorff), and that the inclusion $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n$ is a closed embedding. The second is that the colimit 

$$X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \ldots$$ 

of the sequence of skeleta and inclusions between them is again normal. 

We give just a sketch of the argument here; for full details see _[[colimits of normal spaces]]_. 

* A basic lemma is that the pushout in $Top$ of a closed embedding $i: X \to Z$ along any map $f: X \to Y$ is again a closed embedding, $j: Y \to Y \cup_X Z$. 

* Recall that a space $W$ is normal iff for any closed subspace $C \subseteq W$ and continuous function $f: C \to \mathbb{R}$, there is a continuous extension of $f$ to a map $g: W \to \mathbb{R}$. This may be exploited to give a simple proof of the following result: if $Y, Z$ are normal and $X \hookrightarrow Z$ is a closed subspace, then given a continuous map $f: X \to Y$, the space $W$ in the 
topological pushout diagram 
$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\hookrightarrow} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 
is also normal. Sketch of proof: if $C \subseteq W$ is closed and $\phi: C \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, first extend the evident map $k^{-1}(C) \to \mathbb{R}$ to a map $\beta: Y \to \mathbb{R}$, and similarly extend a suitable map $h(X) \cup g^{-1}(C) \to \mathbb{R}$ to a map $\theta: Z \to \mathbb{R}$, compatibly with $\beta$ so that the pair $(\beta, \theta)$ induces a map $\psi: W \to \mathbb{R}$ out of the pullback that restricts to $\phi: C \to \mathbb{R}$. 

* Assuming then that the $(n-1)$-skeleton $X_{n-1}$ is normal, and forming an adjunction space $X_n$ by attaching a collection of $n$-disks $\sum_{i \in I} D_i^n$ to $X_{n-1}$ by an attaching map $f: \sum_{i \in I} S_i^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$, it follows that the space $X_n$ is normal, and the embedding $X_{n-1} \to X_n$ is closed. 

* Finally, one proves without difficulty that the topological colimit of a sequence of normal spaces and closed embeddings between them is again normal. This applies in particular to the sequence of skeleta $X_n$ and the embeddings between them. 

### CW-complexes are paracompact

+-- {: .num_lemma #CellAttachmentToParacompactHausdorffIsStillParacompactHausdorff}
###### Lemma
**(cell attachment to paracompact Hausdorff is still paracompact Hausdorff)**

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] and let 

$$
  \array{
     S^{n-1} &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_X}}
     \\
     D^n &\underset{i_{D^n}}{\longrightarrow}& X \cup_f D^n
  }
$$

be a [[cell attachment]]. Then also $X \cup_f D^n$ is paracompact.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{ U_i \subset X \cup_f D^n \}_{i \in I}$ be any open cover of the attachment space. We need to produce a locally finite refinement.


Observe that 

1 .$X \cup_f D^n$ is the union of the subsets

   $$
     (D^n \setminus S^{n-1}), (X \setminus f(S^{n-1})), f(S^{n-1})
     \;\subset\;
     X \cup_f D^{n}
     \,.
   $$

1. $D^n$ is itself paracompact Hausdorff (paracompact since it is actually compact, e.g. by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]], and Hausdorff since it is a metric space),

1. $S^{n-1} \subset D^n$ and $f(S^{n-1}) \subset X$ are closed subsets. The former is [[compact topological space|compact]] for instance by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]], and so this follows because [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] and because [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]].

Let now $\{ i_{D^n}^{-1}(U_i) \subset D^n \}_{i \in I}$
and $\{i_{X}^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be the restrictions of the given cover. By paracompactness of $D^n$ and of $X$, these restrictions have locally finite open refinements

$$
  \{
    V_j \subset X
  \}_{j \in J_X}
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  \{
    W_j \subset D^n
  \}_{j \in J_{D^n}}
  \,.
$$

Accordingly there are induced locally finite open refinements

$$
  \{
    V_j \setminus f(S^{n-1}) \subset X \setminus f(S^{n-1})
  \}_{j \in J_X}
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  \{
    W_j \setminus S^{n-1} \subset D^n \setminus S^{n-1}
  \}_{j \in J_{D^n}}
  \,.
$$

Their images under $i_{X}$ and $i_{D^n}$ in $X \cup_f D^n$ are still open, hence yield a locally finite set of subset of $X \cup_f D^n$. 

Its only failure is that it does not cover $f(S^{n-1}) \subset X \cup_f D^n$. But, as before, this is a compact subset, and hence there is a finite subset $J_{f(S^{n-1})} \subset I$ such that the original $U_i$ with $i \in J_{f(S^{n-1})}$ cover this subset. Since these are finitely many, the resulting cover

$$
  \left\{
    i_{D^n}\left( V_j \setminus S^{n-1} \right)
    \subset X \cup_f D^n
  \right\}_{j \in J_{D^n}}
  \sqcup
  \left\{
    i_{X}
    \left(
      W_j \setminus f(S^{n-1})
    \right)
    \subset X \cup_f D^n
  \right\}
  \sqcup
  \left\{
    U_i \subset X \cup_f D^n
  \right\}_{i \in J_{f(S^{n-1})}}
$$

is a locally finite refinement of the original cover.

=--

A direct corollary of lemma \ref{CellAttachmentToParacompactHausdorffIsStillParacompactHausdorff} is that _finite_ CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff, and similarly that finite relative CW-complexes relative to paracompact Hausdorff spaces are paracompact Hausdorff.

For the non-finite case one needs a bit more...
