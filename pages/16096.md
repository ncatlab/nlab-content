## Idea

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, and given $k \in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$, there is a [[Lie groupoid]] whose [[objects]] are the points of $X$ and whose [[morphisms]] between two such points $x\to y$ are order-$k$ [[jets]] of local [[diffeomorphisms]] taking $x$ to $y$.

These Lie groupoids are often called _jet groupoids_, e.g. ([Lorenz 09](#Lorenz09)). If one passes from jets to [[germs]] of local diffeomorphisms then one arrives essentially at the [[Haefliger groupoid]] of $X$ (except that this has a more discrete smooth structure on its set of morphisms).

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[differential cohesion]] there is the bundle $T_{inf}^k X\to X$ of order-$k$ [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] in $X$. In terms of this the jet groupoid is the [[Atiyah groupoid]] of $T_{inf}^k X$, the groupoid whose morphisms between objects $x$ and $y$ are isomorphism of the [[fibers]] of this bundle over these points.
