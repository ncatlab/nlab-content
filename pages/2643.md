A _rigged Hilbert space_ is a formal device which makes it possible to treat spectral theory of unbounded normal operators on Hilbert space as if it were about actual eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It may be used to make rigorous the idea of eigenstates for observables as they commonly arise in quantum mechanics. 

## Example 

Let $H$ be the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R}, d x)$ consisting of square integrable functions $f$ with respect to Lebesgue measure. There is an unbounded self-adjoint operator 

$$m_x: H \to H: f \mapsto x \cdot f$$ 

where $(x \cdot f)(y) := y f(y)$. This operator is not defined on all of $H$, but it is defined on a dense subspace of $H$. For example, if $S$ is the Schwartz space consisting of smooth functions $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ all of whose derivatives $f^{(n)}(x)$ decay rapidly at infinity (more rapidly than any negative power of $|x|$), then there is a dense inclusion map $i: S \to H$, and $m_x$ is defined globally on $S$. 

Meanwhile the Schwartz space $S$ carries its own topology (as described in the article [[distribution]]), stronger than the topology it inherits from $H$, and the space of tempered distributions $S^*$ is defined to be the continuous dual of the [[topological vector space|TVS]] $S$. Since the continuous inclusion $i: S \to H$ is dense, it follows that any continuous functional 

$$f: S \to \mathbb{C}$$ 

has at most one extension to a continuous functional $H \to \mathbb{C}$. In other words, the adjoint map 

$$i^*: H^* \to S^*$$ 

is injective. In addition, the topology on $S$ is such that the operator $m_x: S \to S$ is continuous. 

In this example, there is a dense inclusion $S \to S^*$ defined by the inner product pairing, and the operator $m_x$ extends uniquely to an operator $S^* \to S^*$, called $m_x$ by abuse of notation. Again, in this example, the operator $m_x: S^* \to S^*$ has an eigenvector $s_{\xi}$ for each $\xi \in \mathbb{R}$:  

$$m_x(s_{\xi}) = \xi s_{\xi}$$ 

_Ugh. Lousy start on something that would be nice to understand properly. Maybe an expert can help out. John, you there?_
