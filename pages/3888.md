**Mathematical Reviews** is an indexing service provided by the [American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org), giving the publication data of mathematics publications which are most often (but not always) accompanied with a short or a featured review "article" or with the original abstract.
Its online version is called **MathSciNet**:

* web: [https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/)

It requires subscription, but some of its services, most notably the so called **Relay Station** does not. Relay Station gives the full reference (and sometimes a link to the journal) called by the MR number of the review, but does not provide the abstract or the review unless one has a subscription.

MR numbers have two formats. Relay station accepts both formats. To link from $n$lab, the URL is of the following form:

**https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=FORMAT

where FORMAT includes the code after the MR. So MR92a:81191 has 

**https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=92a:81191

and MR1289330 has the URL

**https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1289330

MR numbers can be discovered using the free [**MR Lookup** service](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mrlookup).

This can also provide citations in BibTeX format.  The [MRef](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mref/) tool can also be used to parse citations copied and pasted from elsewhere.
