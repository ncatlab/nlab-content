This page contains a detailed introduction to basic [[topology]].
Starting from scratch (required background is just a basic concept of _[[sets]]_), and amplifying motivation from [[analysis]],
it first develops standard [[point-set topology]] ([[topological spaces]]).
In passing, some basics of [[category theory]] make an informal appearance,
used to transparently summarize some conceptually important aspects of the theory, such as
[[initial topology|initial]] and [[final topologies]] and the [[reflective subcategory|reflection]] into
[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[sober topological spaces]].
We close with discussion of the basics of [[topological manifolds]] and [[differentiable manifolds]],
laying the foundations for [[differential geometry]].

$\,$

The idea of _[[topology]]_ is to study "[[spaces]]" with "[[continuous functions]]" between them.
Specifically one considers [[functions]] between [[sets]] (whence "[[point-set topology]]", see [below](#PointSetTopology))
such that there is a concept for what it means that these functions depend
continuously on their arguments, in that their values do not "jump".
Such a concept of [[continuous function|continuity]] is familiar from [[analysis]] on [[metric spaces]],
(recalled [below](#Continuity)) but the definition in topology generalizes this analytic concept
and renders it more foundational, generalizing the concept of [[metric spaces]] to that of _[[topological spaces]]_.
(def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} below).

Hence, [[topology]] is the study of the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]], and whose
[[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] (see also remark \ref{TopCategory} below).
This category is much more flexible than that of [[metric spaces]], for example it admits the construction of
arbitrary [[quotients]] and [[intersections]] of spaces.
Accordingly, topology underlies or informs many and diverse areas of mathematics, such as
[[functional analysis]], [[operator algebra]], [[manifold]]/[[scheme]] theory, hence [[algebraic geometry]] and [[differential geometry]],
and the study of [[topological groups]], [[topological vector spaces]], [[local  rings]], etc. Not the least, it gives rise to
the field of [[homotopy theory]], where one considers also continuous deformations of
continuous functions themselves ("[[homotopies]]").
Topology itself has many branches,
such as _[[low-dimensional topology]]_ or _[[topological domain theory]]_.

A popular imagery for the concept of a [[continuous function]] is provided by deformations of [[elasticity|elastic]]
physical bodies, which may be deformed by stretching them without tearing. The canonical illustration is
a continuous [[bijection|bijective]] function from the [[torus]] to the surface of a coffee mug, which maps half of the torus to the
handle of the coffee mug, and continuously deforms parts of the other half in order to form the actual cup.
Since the [[inverse function]] to this function is itself continuous,
the torus and the coffee mug, both regarded as [[topological spaces]], are "[[isomorphism|the same]]"
for the purposes of [[topology]]; one says they are _[[homeomorphic]]_.

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Surfaces.png" width="400">
</div>

On the other hand, there is _no_ [[homeomorphism]] from the [[torus]] to, for instance, the [[sphere]], signifying that these
represent two topologically distinct spaces. Part of topology is concerned with studying [[homeomorphism]]-[[invariants]]
of topological spaces ("[[topological properties]]") which allow to detect by means of [[algebra|algebraic]] manipulations
whether two topological spaces are homeomorphic
(or more generally [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]]) or not. This is called _[[algebraic topology]]_.
A basic algebraic invariant is the [[fundamental group]] of a topological space (discussed [below](#FundamentalGroups)),
which measures how many ways there are to wind loops inside a topological space.

Beware the popular imagery of "[[rubber-sheet geometry]]", which only captures part of the full scope of topology,
in that it invokes spaces that _locally_ still look like [[metric spaces]] (called _[[topological manifolds]]_, see [below](#Manifolds)).
But the concept of topological spaces is a good bit more general.
Notably, [[finite topological spaces]] are either [[discrete topological space|discrete]] or very much unlike
[[metric spaces]] (example \ref{FiniteT1SpacesAreDiscrete} below); the former play a role in [[categorical logic]]. Also, in [[geometry]], exotic topological spaces frequently arise when  forming non-free [[quotients]].
In order to gauge just how many of such "exotic" examples of topological  spaces beyond locally [[metric spaces]] one wishes
to admit in the theory,
extra "[[separation axioms]]" are imposed on topological spaces (see [below](#SeparationAxioms)), and the flavour of topology as a field
depends on this choice.

Among the separation axioms, the _[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff space]]_ axiom is the most popular
(see [below](#TnTopologicalSpaces)). But the weaker axiom of [[sober topological space|sobriety]] (see [below](#SoberSpaces))
stands out, because on the one
hand it is the weakest axiom that is still naturally satisfied in applications to [[algebraic geometry]] ([[schemes are sober]])
and [[computer science]] ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)), and on the other, it fully realizes the strong roots that
topology has in [[formal logic]]: [[sober topological spaces]] are entirely characterized by the
union-, intersection- and inclusion-relations
(logical [[conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[implication]]) among their [[open subsets]] ([[propositions]]).
This leads to a natural
and fruitful generalization of [[topology]] to more general "purely logic-determined spaces", called _[[locales]]_,
and in yet more generality, _[[toposes]]_ and _[[higher topos theory|higher toposes]]_. While the latter are beyond
the scope of this introduction, their rich theory and relation to the [[foundations]] of mathematics and geometry
provide an outlook on the relevance of the basic ideas of [[topology]].


$\,$



In this first part we discuss the foundations of the concept of "sets equipped with topology"
([[topological spaces]]) and of [[continuous functions]] between them.



$\,$

+-- {: principle}
**([[classical logic]])**

The [[proofs]] in the following freely use the [[principle of excluded middle]], hence [[proof by contradiction]],
and in a few places they also use the [[axiom of choice]]/[[Zorn's lemma]].

Hence we discuss [[topology]] in its traditional form with [[classical logic]].

We do however highlight the role of [[frame]] homomorphisms (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens} below) and that of [[sober topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Sober} below). These concepts pave the way to a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]]
formulation of [[topology]] in terms not of [[topological spaces]] but in terms of _[[locales]]_ (remark \ref{Locales} below).
For further reading along these lines see [Johnstone 83](locale#Johnstone83).

+-- {: principle}
**([[set theory]])**

Apart from [[classical logic]], we assume the usual informal concept of [[sets]]. The reader (only) needs to
know the concepts of

1. [[subsets]] $S \subset X$;

1. [[complements]] $X \setminus S$ of subsets;

1. [[image]] sets $f(X)$ and [[pre-image]] sets $f^{-1}(Y)$ under a [[function]]
$f \colon X \to Y$;

1. [[unions]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} S_i$ and [[intersections]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} S_i$ of [[dependent type|indexed sets of]] subsets $\{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$.

The only rules of set theory that we use are the

1. [[interactions of images and pre-images with unions and intersections]]

1. [[de Morgan duality]].

For reference, we recall these:

+-- {: .num_prop #PreservationOfUnionsAndIntersectionsOfSets}
###### Proposition
**([[images]] preserve [[unions]] but not in general [[intersections]])**

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[function]] between [[sets]]. Let $\{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[subsets]] of $X$. Then

1. $f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cup}  S_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cup} f(S_i)\right)$ (the [[image]] under $f$ of a [[union]] of subsets is the union of the images)

1. $f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i\right) \subset \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} f(S_i)\right)$ (the [[image]] under $f$ of the [[intersection]] of the subsets is contained in the intersection of the images).

The [[injective function|injection]] in the second item is in general proper. If $f$ is an [[injective function]] and if $I$ is [[inhabited set|non-empty]], then this is a [[bijection]]:

* $(f\,\text{injective}) \Rightarrow \left(f\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} f(S_i)\right)\right)$

###### Proposition
**([[pre-images]] preserve [[unions]] and [[intersections]])**

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[function]] between [[sets]]. Let $\{T_i \subset Y\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[subsets]] of $Y$. Then

1. $f^{-1}\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cup}  T_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cup} f^{-1}(T_i)\right)$ (the [[pre-image]] under $f$ of a [[union]] of subsets is the union of the pre-images),

1. $f^{-1}\left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  T_i\right) = \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} f^{-1}(T_i)\right)$ (the [[pre-image]] under $f$ of the [[intersection]] of the subsets is contained in the intersection of the pre-images).

+-- {: .num_prop #deMorgan}
###### Proposition
**([[de Morgan's law]])**

Given a [[set]] $X$ and a set of subsets

$$
  \{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}
$$

then the [[complement]] of their [[union]] is the [[intersection]] of their [[complements]]

$$
  X \setminus
  \left(
     \underset{i \in I}{\cup}  S_i
  \right)
  \;\;=\;\;
   \underset{i \in I}{\cap}
   \left(
      X \setminus S_i
   \right)
$$

and the [[complement]] of their [[intersection]] is the [[union]] of their [[complements]]

$$
  X \setminus
  \left(
     \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i
  \right)
  \;\;=\;\;
   \underset{i \in I}{\cup}
   \left(
      X \setminus S_i
   \right)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, taking complements reverses inclusion relations:

$$
  \left(
    S_1 \subset S_2
  \right)
  \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\,
  \left(
    X\setminus S_2 \subset X \setminus S_1
  \right)
  \,.

## Metric spaces
 {#Continuity}

The concept of continuity was first made precise  in [[analysis]], in terms of [[epsilontic analysis]] on [[metric spaces]], recalled as def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} below. Then it was realized that this has a more elegant formulation in terms of the more general concept of _[[open sets]]_, this is prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets} below. Adopting the latter as the definition leads to a more abstract concept of "continuous space", this is the concept of _[[topological spaces]]_, def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} below.

Here we briefly recall the relevant basic concepts from [[analysis]], as a motivation for various definitions in
[[topology]]. The reader who either already recalls these concepts in analysis
or is content with ignoring the motivation coming from analysis should skip right away to the section _[Topological spaces](#TopologicalSpaces)_.

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpace}
###### Definition
**([[metric space]])**

A _[[metric space]]_ is

1. a [[set]] $X$ (the "underlying set");

1. a [[function]] $d \;\colon\; X \times X \to [0,\infty)$ (the "distance function") from the [[Cartesian product]] of the set with itself to the [[nonnegative number|non-negative]] [[real numbers]]

such that for all $x,y,z \in X$:

1. (symmetry) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$

1. ([[triangle inequality]]) $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y)+ d(y,z)$.

1. (non-degeneracy) $d(x,y) = 0 \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\; x = y$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #OpenBalls}
###### Definition
**([[open balls]])**

Let $(X,d)$, be a [[metric space]]. Then for every element $x \in X$ and every  $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_+$ a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], we write

$$
  B^\circ_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) \lt \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the [[open ball]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$. Similarly we write

$$
  B_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) \leq \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the _closed ball_ of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$. Finally we write

$$
  S_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) = \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the [[sphere]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$.

For $\epsilon = 1$ we also speak of the _unit open/closed ball_ and the _unit sphere_.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}
###### Definition

For $(X,d)$ a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) then a [[subset]] $S \subset X$
is called a _[[bounded subset]]_ if $S$ is contained in some [[open ball]] (def. \ref{OpenBalls})

$$
  S \subset B^\circ_x(r)
$$

around some $x \in X$ of some [[radius]] $r \in \mathbb{R}$.

A key source of metric spaces are [[norm|normed]] _[[vector spaces]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #NormedVectorSpace}
###### Dedfinition
**(normed vector space)**

A _[[normed vector space]]_ is

1. a [[real vector space]] $V$;

1. a [[function]] (the _[[norm]]_)

   $$
     {\Vert {-} \Vert} \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}
   $$

   from the underlying [[set]] of $V$ to the [[non-negative number|non-negative]] [[real numbers]],

such that for all $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with [[absolute value]] ${\vert c \vert}$ and all $v , w \in V$ it holds true that

1. (linearity) ${\Vert c v \Vert} = {\vert c \vert} {\Vert v \Vert }$;

1. ([[triangle inequality]]) ${\Vert v+w \Vert} \leq {\Vert v \Vert } + {\Vert w \Vert}$;

1. (non-degeneracy) if ${\Vert v \Vert} = 0$ then $v = 0$.

=--



+-- {: .num_prop #MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace}
###### Proposition

Every [[normed vector space]] $(V, {\Vert {-} \Vert})$
becomes a [[metric space]] according to def. \ref{MetricSpace} by setting

$$
  d(x,y) \coloneqq {\Vert x-y \Vert}
  \,.
$$

=--

Examples of [[normed vector spaces]] (def. \ref{NormedVectorSpace}) and hence, via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace},
of [[metric spaces]] include the following:

+-- {: .num_example #EuclideanNorm}
###### Example
**([[Euclidean space]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[Cartesian space]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n
    =
   \left\{
     \vec x
     =
     (x_i)_{i = 1}^n
     \vert
      x_i \in \mathbb{R}
   \right\}
$$

carries a [[norm]] (the _Euclidean norm_ ) given by the [[square root]] of the [[sum]] of the [[squares]] of the components:

   $$
     {\Vert \vec x \Vert}
       \;\coloneqq\;
     \sqrt{
     \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
       (x_i)^2
     }
     \,.
   $$

Via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace} this gives $\mathbb{R}^n$ the structure of a
[[metric space]], and as such it is called the _[[Euclidean space]]_ of [[dimension]] $n$.

</div>

More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $p \in \mathbb{R}$, $p \geq 1$, then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ carries the _[[p-norm]]_

   $$
     {\Vert \vec x \Vert}_p  \coloneqq \root p {\sum_i {|x_i|^p}}
   $$

One also sets

$$
  {\Vert \vec x \Vert}_\infty \coloneqq \underset{i \in I}{max} \, {\vert x_i \vert}
$$

and calls this the _[[supremum norm]]_.

The graphics on the right (grabbed from Wikipedia) shows unit circles (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to various [[p-norms]].

By the [[Minkowski inequality]],
the [[p-norm]] generalizes to non-[[finite dimensional vector spaces]] such as [[sequence spaces]] and [[Lebesgue spaces]].

For $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ two [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), then a [[function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is said to be _continuous at a point $x \in X$_ if for
every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon$
there exists a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\delta$ such that
for all $x' \in X$ that are a [[distance]] smaller than $\delta$ from $x$ then their image $f(x')$
is a distance smaller than $\epsilon$ from $f(x)$:

$$
  \left(
    f\,\, \text{continuous at}\, x
  \right)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{{\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}} \atop {\epsilon \gt 0}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \underset{{\delta \in \mathbb{R}} \atop {\delta \gt 0}}{\exists}
      \left(
        \left(
          d_X(x,x') \lt \delta
        \right)
           \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
        \left(
          d_Y(\,f(x), f(x')\,) \lt \epsilon
        \right)
      \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The function $f$ is said to be _continuous_ if it is continuous at every point $x \in X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #DistanceFunctionFromsubset}
###### Example
**(distance function from a subset is continuous)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace})
and let $S \subset X$ be a [[subset]] of the underlying set.
Define then the function

$$
  d(S,-) \;\colon\; X \to \mathbb{R}
$$

from the underlying set $X$ to the [[real numbers]] by assigning to a point $x \in X$ the [[infimum]] of the [[distances]] from $x$ to $s$, as
$s$ ranges over the elements of $S$:

$$
  d(S,x) \coloneqq inf \left\{ d(s,x) \,\vert\,  s\in S  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This is a continuous function, with $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as a [[metric space]] via its [[Euclidean norm]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

In particular the original distance function $d(x,-) = d(\{x\},-)$ is continuous in both its arguments.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $x \in X$ and let $\epsilon$ be a positive real number. We need to find a positive real number
$\delta$ such that for $y \in X$ with $d(x,y) \lt \delta$ then ${\vert d(S,x) - d(S,y) \vert} \lt \epsilon$.

For $s \in S$ and $y \in X$, consider the [[triangle inequalities]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d(s,x) & \leq d(s,y) + d(y,x)
    \\
    d(s,y) & \leq d(s,x) + d(x,y)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Forming the [[infimum]] over $s \in S$ of all terms appearing here yields

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d(S,x) & \leq d(S,y) + d(y,x)
    \\
    d(S,y) & \leq d(S,x) + d(x,y)
  \end{aligned}
$$

which implies

$$
  {\vert d(S,x) - d(S,y) \vert} \leq d(x,y)
  \,.
$$

This means that we may take for instance $\delta \coloneqq \epsilon$.

+-- {: .num_example #PolynoialsAreContinuous}
###### Example
**([[rational functions are continuous]])**

Consider the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as the
1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}$ from example \ref{EuclideanNorm}.

For $P \in \mathbb{R}[X]$ a [[polynomial]], then the function

$$
  \array{
    f_P &\colon& \mathbb{R} &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& P(x)
  }
$$

is a [[continuous function]] in the sense of def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity}.
Hence [[polynomials are continuous functions]].

Similarly [[rational functions are continuous]] on their [[domain]] of definition:
for $P,Q \in \mathbb{R}[X]$ two polynomials, then $\frac{f_P}{f_Q} \colon \mathbb{R} \setminus \{x | f_Q(x) = 0\} \to \mathbb{R}$
is a continuous function.

Also for instance forming the [[square root]] is a continuous function $\sqrt(-) \colon \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$.


=--

On the other hand, a [[step function]] is continuous everywhere except at the [[finite number]] of points
at which it changes its value, see example \ref{StepFunction} below.


We now reformulate the analytic concept of continuity from def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} in terms of the simple but important concept of _[[open sets]]_:


+-- {: .num_defn #OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}
###### Definition
**(neighbourhood and open set)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}). Say that:

1. A _[[neighbourhood]]_ of a point $x \in X$ is a [[subset]] $U_x \subset X$ which contains some [[open ball]] $B_x^\circ(\epsilon) \subset U_x$ around $x$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}).

1. An _[[open subset]]_ of $X$ is a [[subset]] $U \subset X$ such that for every $x \in U$ it also contains an [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ around $x$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}).

1. An _[[open neighbourhood]]_ of a point $x \in X$ is a [[neighbourhood]] $U_x$ of $x$ which is also an open subset, hence equivalently this is any open subset of $X$ that contains $x$.

=--


The following picture shows a point $x$, some [[open balls]] $B_i$ containing it, and two of its [[neighbourhoods]] $U_i$:

###### Example
**(the empty subset is open)**

Notice that for $(X,d)$ a [[metric space]], then the [[empty set|empty]] [[subset]] $\emptyset \subset X$
is always an [[open subset]] of $(X,d)$ according to def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}.
This is because the clause for open subsets $U \subset X$ says that "for every point $x \in U$ there exists...",
but since there is no $x$ in $U = \emptyset$, this clause is always satisfied in this case.

Conversely, the entire set $X$ is always an open subset of $(X,d)$.

1. $(a,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x \leq b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*half-open interval*)

1. $[a,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x \lt b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*half-open interval*)

1. $[a,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x \leq b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*closed interval*)

The first of these is an open subset according to def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}, the other three are not.
The first one is called an _[[open interval]]_, the last one a _[[closed interval]]_
and the middle two are called _[[half-open intervals]]_.

Similarly for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ one considers

1. $(-\infty,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert x \lt b  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*unbounded open interval*)

1. $(a,\infty) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ $\,\,$ (*unbounded open interval*)

1. $(-\infty,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert x \leq b  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*unbounded half-open interval*)

1. $[a,\infty) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ $\,\,$ (*unbounded half-open interval*)

The first two of these are open subsets, the last two are not.

For completeness we may also consider

* $(-\infty , \infty) = \mathbb{R}$

* $(a,a) = \emptyset$

which are both open, according to def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}.

###### Proposition
**(rephrasing continuity in terms of open sets)**

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be two [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}).
Then a [[function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] in the [[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] sense of def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} precisely if it has the property that its [[pre-images]] of [[open subsets]] of $Y$ (in the sense of def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}) are open subsets of $X$:

$$

    f \,\, \text{continuous}

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe, by direct unwinding the definitions,
that the epsilontic definition of continuity (def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity}) says equivalently in
terms of [[open balls]] (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) that
$f$ is continous at $x$ precisely if for every open ball $B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)$ around an image
point, there exists an open ball $B^\circ_x(\delta)$ around the corresponding pre-image
point which maps into it:

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      f \,\,\text{continuous at}\,\, x
    \right)
    & \Leftrightarrow \;
    \underset{\epsilon \gt 0}{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{\delta \gt 0}{\exists}
      \left(
        f(\;B_x^\circ(\delta)\;) \;\subset\; B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)
      \right)
    \right)
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow \;
    \underset{\epsilon \gt 0}{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{\delta \gt 0}{\exists}
      \left(
        B^\circ_x(\delta) \subset f^{-1}\left( B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon) \right)
      \right)
    \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

With this observation the proof immediate. For the record, we spell it out:

First assume that $f$ is continuous in the epsilontic sense. Then for $O_Y \subset Y$ any [[open subset]] and $x \in f^{-1}(O_Y)$ any point in the pre-image, we need to show that there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] of $x$ in $f^{-1}(O_Y)$.

That $O_Y$ is open in $Y$ means by definition that there exists an [[open ball]] $B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)$ in $O_Y$ around $f(x)$
for some radius $\epsilon$. By the assumption that $f$ is continuous and using the above observation, this implies that there exists an
open ball $B^\circ_x(\delta)$ in $X$ such that $f(B^\circ_x(\delta)) \subset B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon) \subset Y$,
hence such that $B^\circ_x(\delta) \subset f^{-1}\left(B^{\circ}_{f(x)}(\epsilon)\right) \subset f^{-1}(O_Y)$.
Hence this is an open ball of the required kind.

Conversely, assume that the pre-image function $f^{-1}$ takes open subsets to open subsets. Then for every $x \in X$ and $B_{f(x)}^\circ(\epsilon) \subset Y$ an [[open ball]] around its image, we need to produce an open ball $B_x^\circ(\delta) \subset X$ around $x$
such that $f(B_x^\circ(\delta)) \subset B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)$.

But by definition of open subsets, $B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon) \subset Y$ is open, and therefore by assumption on $f$
its pre-image $f^{-1}(B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)) \subset X$ is also an open subset of $X$. Again by definition of
open subsets, this implies that it contains an open ball as required.

$$
  H^{-1} \;\colon\;
  (a,b)

By example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}, all except the last of these pre-images listed are open subsets.

The failure of the last of the pre-images to be open
witnesses that the step function is not continuous at $x = 0$.

### Compactness
 {#CompactMetricSpaces}

A key application of [[metric spaces]] in [[analysis]] is that they allow a formalization of what it means
for an infinite [[sequence]] of elements in the metric space (def. \ref{Sequences} below)
to _[[convergence|converge]]_ to a _[[limit of a sequence]]_ (def. \ref{Convergence} below).
Of particular interest are therefore those metric spaces for which each sequence has a converging subsequence:
the _[[sequentially compact metric spaces]]_ (def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}).

We now briefly recall these concepts from [[analysis]]. Then, in the above spirit, we reformulate
their epsilontic definition in terms of [[open subsets]].
This gives a useful definition that generalizes to [[topological spaces]], the _[[compact topological spaces]]_
discussed further [below](#CompactSpaces).

$$
  x_{(-)}
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{N}
    \longrightarrow
  X
$$

from the [[natural numbers]] to $X$.

A _[[sub-sequence]]_ of such a sequence is a sequence of the form

$$
  x_{\iota(-)}
   \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{N}
    \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow}

  x_{(-)}

$$

in the underlying set $X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}) is said to _[[convergence|converge]]_ to a point $x_\infty \in X$, denoted

$$
  x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
$$

if for every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon$, there exists a [[natural number]] $n$, such that
all elements in the sequence after the $n$th one have [[distance]] less than $\epsilon$ from $x_\infty$.

$$
  \left(
    x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
  \right)
   \,\Leftrightarrow\,

Often one writes $\underset{i \to \infty}{\lim}x_i$ for this point.

A [[normed vector space]], regarded as a metric space via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace} that

The key fact to translate this [[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] definition of compactness to a concept that
makes sense for general [[topological spaces]] ([below](#CompactSpaces)) is the following:

+-- {: .num_prop #CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
###### Proposition
**([[sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]])**

For a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is [[sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]];

1. for every [[set]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of [[open subsets]] $U_i$ of $X$ (def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace})
   which [[open cover|cover]] $X$ in that $X = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i$, then
   there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ of these open subsets which still covers
   $X$ in that also $X = \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} U_i$.

=--

The **proof** of prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
is most conveniently formulated with some of the terminology of topology in hand, which we introduce now.
Therefore we postpone the proof to [below](#ProofOfSequentiallyCompactMetricSpacesAreEquivCompact).


$\,$

In **summary** prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets} and prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
show that the purely combinatorial
and in particular non-[[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] concept of _[[open subsets]]_ captures a substantial part of the nature of
[[metric spaces]] in [[analysis]]. This motivates to reverse the logic and consider more general "[[spaces]]" which are
_only_ characterized by what counts as their open subsets. These are the _[[topological spaces]]_
which we turn to now in def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} (or, more generally, these are the "[[locales]]", which we briefly
consider below in remark \ref{Locales}).


$\,$




## Topological spaces
 {#TopologicalSpaces}

Due to prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets}
we should pay attention to [[open subsets]] in [[metric spaces]]. It turns out that the following closure
property, which follow directly from the definitions, is at the heart of the concept:


+-- {: .num_prop #OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties}
###### Proposition
**(closure properties of open sets in a metric space)**

The collection of [[open subsets]] of a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ as in def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} has the following properties:

1. The [[union]] of any [[set]] of open subsets is again an open subset.

1. The [[intersection]] of any [[finite number]] of open subsets is again an open subset.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #EmptyIntersection}
###### Remark
**(empty union and empty intersection)**

Notice the degenerate case of [[unions]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i$
and [[intersections]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_i$ of [[subsets]] $U_i \subset X$ for the case that they
are indexed by the [[empty set]] $I = \emptyset$:

1. the _empty union_ is the empty set itself;

1. the _empty intersection_ is all of $X$.

(The second of these may seem less obvious than the first. We discuss the general logic behind these kinds of phenomena [below](#UniversalConstructions).)

This way prop. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties}
is indeed compatible with the degenerate cases of examples of open subsets in example \ref{OpenEmptySet}.

=--


Proposition \ref{OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties} motivates
the following generalized definition, which abstracts away from the concept of [[metric space]]
just its system of [[open subsets]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**([[topological spaces]])**

Given a [[set]] $X$, then a _topology_ on $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ called the _[[open subsets]]_, hence a [[subset]] of the [[power set]] $P(X)$

$$
  \tau \subset P(X)
$$

such that this is closed under forming

1. finite [[intersections]];

1. arbitrary [[unions]].

In particular (by remark \ref{EmptyIntersection}):

* the [[empty set]] $\emptyset \subset X$ is in $\tau$ (being the union of no subsets)

and

* the whole set $X \subset X$ itself is in $\tau$ (being the intersection of no subsets).

A set $X$ equipped with such a [[topology]] is called a _[[topological space]]_.

###### Remark

In the field of [[topology]] it is common to eventually simply say "[[space]]" as shorthand for "[[topological space]]".
This is especially so as further qualifiers are added, such as "Hausdorff  space" (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace} below).
But beware that there are other kinds of [[spaces]] in mathematics.

In view of example \ref{MetricTopology} below one generalizes the terminology from
def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn #Neighbourhood}
###### Definition
**([[neighbourhood]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and let $x \in X$ be a point.
A _[[neighbourhood]]_ of $x$ is a [[subset]] $U_x \subset X$ which contains an
[[open subset]] that still contains $x$.

An _open neighbourhood_ is a neighbourhood that is itself an open subset, hence an open neighbourhood
of $x$ is the same as an open subset containing $x$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The simple definition of [[open subsets]] in def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} and the simple
implementation of the _principle of continuity_ below in def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}
gives the field of [[topology]] its fundamental and universal flavor. The combinatorial nature of these definitions makes
[[topology]] be closely related to [[formal logic]]. This becomes more manifest still for the "[[sober topological space]]"
discussed [below](#SoberSpaces). For more on this perspective see the remark on _[[locales]]_ below, remark \ref{Locales}.
An introductory textbook amplifying this perspective is ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)).

Before we look at first examples [below](#TopologicalSpacesExamples),
here is some common **further terminology** regarding topological spaces:

###### Definition
**([[finer topology|finer/coarser topologies]])**

Let $X$ be a [[set]], and let $\tau_1, \tau_2 \in P(X)$ be two [[topological space|topologies]] on $X$,
hence two choices of [[open subsets]] for $X$, making it a [[topological space]]. If

$$
  \tau_1 \subset \tau_2
$$

hence if every open subset of $X$ with respect to $\tau_1$ is also regarded as open by $\tau_2$, then
one says that

* the topology $\tau_2$ is _[[finer topology|finer]]_ than the topology $\tau_2$

* the topology $\tau_1$ is _[[coarser topology|coarser]]_ than the topology $\tau_1$.

With any kind of [[mathematical structure|structure]] on [[sets]], it is of interest how to

###### Definition
**([[basis for the topology]])**

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], def. \ref{TopologicalSpace},
and let

$$
  \beta \subset \tau
$$

be a [[subset]] of its set of [[open subsets]]. We say that

1. $\beta$ is a _[[topological base|basis for the topology]]_ $\tau$ if every open subset $O \in \tau$ is a [[union]] of elements of $\beta$;

1. $\beta$ is a _[[topological base|sub-basis for the topology]]_ if every open subset $O \in \tau $ is a [[union]] of [[finitary intersections|finite intersections]] of elements of $\beta$.

Often it is convenient to _define_ topologies by defining some (sub-)basis as in def. \ref{TopologyBase}. Examples are the
the [[metric topology]] below, example \ref{MetricTopology},
the [[product topological space|binary product topology]] in def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace} below,
and the [[compact-open topology]] on [[mapping spaces]] below in def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}.
To make use of this, we need to recognize sets of open subsets that serve as the basis for some topology:

+-- {: .num_lemma #RecognizingTopologicalBasis}
###### Lemma
**(recognition of topological bases)**

Let $X$ be a set.

1. A collection $\beta \subset P(X)$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ is a [[basis of a topology|basis]]
for some topology $\tau \subset P(X)$ (def. \ref{TopologyBase}) precisely if

   1. every point of $X$ is contained in at least one element of $\beta$;

   1. for every two subsets $B_1, B_2 \in \beta$ and for every point $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$ in their intersection, then there exists
   a $B \in \beta$ that contains $x$ and is contained in the intersection: $x \in B \subset B_1 \cap B_2$.

1. A subset $B \subset \tau$ of open subsets is a sub-basis for a topology $\tau$ on $X$ precisely if $\tau$ is the coarsest topology (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) which contains $B$.

### Examples
 {#TopologicalSpacesExamples}

We discuss here some basic examples of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}), to get a feeling for
the scope of the concept. But topological spaces are ubiquituous in [[mathematics]], so that there are many more examples
and many more classes of examples than could be listed. As we further develop the theory below, we encounter more examples,
and more classes of examples. Below in _[Universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions)_ we discuss a very general construction
principle of new topological space from  given ones.

First of all, our motivating example from [above](#Continuity) now reads as follows:

+-- {: .num_example #MetricTopology}
###### Example
**([[metric topology]])**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}). Then the collection of its [[open subsets]] in def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} constitutes a _[[topological space|topology]]_ on the set $X$, making it a _[[topological space]]_ in the sense of def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}. This is called the _[[metric topology]]_.

The [[open balls]] in a metric space constitute a [[basis of a topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}) for the [[metric topology]].



=--




While the example of [[metric space]] topologies (example \ref{MetricTopology}) is the motivating example
for the concept of [[topological spaces]], it is important to notice that the concept
of topological spaces is considerably more general, as some of the following examples show.


The following simplistic example of a (metric) topological space is important for the theory
(for instance in prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub}):

We write also

$$
  \emptyset
    \;\coloneqq\;
   \left(
     \emptyset, \tau_{\emptyset} = \{ \emptyset  \}
   \right)
$$

for the resulting [[topological space]],
which we call the _[[empty topological space]]_.

On a [[singleton]] set $\{1\}$ there exists a unique topology $\tau$
making it a [[topological space]] according to def. \ref{TopologicalSpace},
namelyf

$$
  \tau
    \coloneqq

  \right)
$$

for this topological space and call it _the [[point topological space]]_.

This is equivalently the [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}) on $\mathbb{R}^0$,
regarded as the 0-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

1. the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) $\tau = \left\{   \emptyset, \{0,1\}  \right\}$;

1. the _[[discrete topology]]_ (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}), $\tau = \left\{   \emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}  \right\}$;

###### Example
**(discrete and co-discrete topology)**

Let $S$ be any [[set]]. Then there are always the following two extreme
possibilities of equipping $X$ with a topology $\tau \subset P(X)$ in the sense of
def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}, and hence making it a [[topological space]]:

1. $\tau \coloneqq P(S)$ the set of _all_ open subsets;

   this is called the _[[discrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[finer topology|finest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$,

   we write $Disc(S)$ for the resulting topological space;

1. $\tau \coloneqq \{ \emptyset, S \}$ the set contaning only the [[empty set|empty]] subset of $S$ and all of $S$ itself;

   this is called the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[coarser topology|coarsest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$,

   we write $CoDisc(S)$ for the resulting topological space.

The reason for this terminology is best seen when considering [[continuous functions]] into or out of these (co-)discrete topological spaces, we come to this in example \ref{ContinuousFunctionsIntoCoDiscreteTopologicalSpaces} below.

Given a [[set]] $X$, then the _[[cofinite topology]]_ or _finite complement topology_ on $X$ is the [[topological space|topology]]
(def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) whose [[open subsets]] are precisely

1. all [[cofinite subsets]] $S \subset X$ (i.e. those such that the [[complement]] $X \setminus S$ is a [[finite set]]);

1. the [[empty set]].

If $X$ is itself a [[finite set]] (but not otherwise) then the cofinite topology on $X$ coincides with the [[discrete topological space|discrete topology]] on $X$ (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}).

is the topological space whose underlying set is the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying sets of the summand spaces,
and whose open subsets are precisely the disjoint unions of the open subsets of the summand spaces.

In particular, for $I$ any index set, then the disjoint union
of $I$ copies of the [[point space]] (example \ref{Point}) is equivalently the [[discrete topological space]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology})

**([[quotient topological space]])**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) and let

$$
  R_\sim \subset X \times X
$$

be an [[equivalence relation]] on its underlying set. Then the _[[quotient topological space]]_  has

* as underlying set the [[quotient set]] $X/\sim$, hence the set of [[equivalence classes]],

and

* a subset $O \subset X/\sim$ is declared to be an [[open subset]] precisely if its [[preimage]] $\pi^{-1}(O)$ under the canonical [[projection map]]

  $$
    \pi \;\colon\; X \to X/\sim
  $$

  is open in $X$.

(This is also called the _[[final topology]]_ of the projection $\pi$. We come back to this below in def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}. )

Often one considers this with input datum not the equivalence relation, but any [[surjection]]

$$
  \pi \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

of sets. Of course this identifies $Y = X/\sim$ with $(x_1 \sim x_2) \Leftrightarrow (\pi(x_1) = \pi(x_2)) $.
Hence the _quotient topology_ on the codomain set of a function out of any topological space has as open subsets
those whose pre-images are open.

To see that this indeed does define a topology on $X/\sim$ it is sufficient to observe that taking pre-images
commutes with taking unions and with taking intersections.

precisely if every [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ of $x$ (def. \ref{Neighbourhood}) [[intersection|intersects]] $S$:

By lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure} we use that a point is in the closure of a set precisely if every [[open neighbourhood]]

Hence in one direction

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} Cl(U_i)
  \subset
  Cl(\underset{i \in I}{\cup}U_i)
$$

because if every neighbourhood of a point intersects all the $U_i$, then every neighbourhood intersects their union.

The other direction

$$
  Cl(\underset{i \in I}{\cup}U_i)
  \subset
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} Cl(U_i)

On left now we have the point for which there exists for each $i \in I$ a neighbourhood $U_{x,i}$ which does not intersect $U_i$. Since $I$ is finite, the intersection $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_{x,i}$ is still an open neighbourhood of $x$, and such that it intersects none of the $U_i$, hence such that it does not intersect their union.

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), regarded as a [[topological space]] via example \ref{MetricTopology},
and let $V \subset X$ be a [[subset]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $V \subset X$ is a [[closed subspace]] according to def. \ref{ClosedSubset}.

1. For every [[sequence]] $x_i \in V \subset X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}) with elements in $V$, which [[convergence|converges]]
   as a sequence in $X$ (def. \ref{Convergence}) to some $x_\infty \in X$, we have $x_\infty \in V \subset X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First assume that $V \subset X$ is closed and that $x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_{\infty}$ for some
$x_\infty \in X$. We need to show that then $x_\infty \in V$. Suppose it were not, hence that
$x_\infty \in X\setminus V$. Since, by assumption on $V$, this [[complement]] $X \setminus V \subset X$ is an [[open subset]],
it would follow that there exists a [[real number]] $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that the [[open ball]]
around $x$ of radius $\epsilon$ were still contained in the complement: $B^\circ_x(\epsilon) \subset X \setminus V$.
But since the sequence is assumed to converge in $X$, this would mean that there exists $N_\epsilon$ such that all
$x_{i \gt N_{\epsilon}}$ are in $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$, hence in $X\setminus V$. This contradicts the assumption that
all $x_i$ are in $V$, and hence we have [[proof by contradiction|proved by contradiction]] that $x_\infty \in V$.

Conversely, assume that for all sequences in $V$ that converge to some $x_\infty \in X$ then $x_\infty \in V \subset X$.
We need to show that then $V$ is closed, hence that $X \setminus V \subset X$ is an open subset, hence that for every
$x \in X \setminus V$ we may find a real number $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that the [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ around $x$
of radius $\epsilon$ is still contained in
$X \setminus V$. Suppose on the contrary that such $\epsilon$ did not exist. This would mean that for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$
with $k \geq 1$ then the [[intersection]] $B^\circ_x(1/k) \cap V$ were [[inhabited|non-empty]]. Hence then we could [[axiom of choice|choose]]
points $x_k \in B^\circ_x(1/k) \cap V$ in these intersections. These would form a sequence which clearly converges to
the original $x$, and so by assumption we would conclude that $x \in V$, which violates the assumption that $x \in X \setminus V$.
Hence we [[proof by contradiction|proved by contradiction]] $X \setminus V$ is in fact open.

Often one considers closed subsets inside a closed subspace. The following is immediate, but useful.

+-- {: .num_lemma #SubsetsInClosedSubspace}
###### Lemma
**([[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}), and let $C \subset X$ be a [[closed subset]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}), regarded as a [[topological subspace]] $(C,\tau_{sub})$ (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}). Then a [[subset]] $S \subset C$ is a [[closed subset]] of $(C,\tau_{sub})$ precisely if it is closed as a subset of $(X,\tau)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $S \subset C$ is closed in $(C,\tau_{sub})$ this means equivalently that there is an open open subset $V \subset C$ in $(C, \tau_{sub})$ such that

$$
  S = C \setminus V
  \,.
$$

But by the definition of the subspace topology, this means equivalently that there is a subset $U \subset X$ which is open in $(X,\tau)$ such that $V = U \cap C$. Hence the above is equivalent to the existence of an open subset $U \subset X$ such that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S & = C \setminus V
    \\
    & = C \setminus (U \cap C)
    \\
    & = C \setminus U
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

But now the condition that $C$ itself is a closed subset of $(X,\tau)$ means equivalently that there is an open subset $W \subset X$ with $C = X \setminus W$. Hence the above is equivalent to the existence of two open subsets $W,U \subset X$ such that

$$
  S = (X \setminus W) \setminus U
   =
   X \setminus (W \cup U)
  \,.
$$

Since the union $W \cup U$ is again open, this implies that $S$ is closed in $(X,\tau)$.

Conversely, that $S \subset X$ is closed in $(X,\tau)$ means that there exists an open $T \subset X$ with  $S = X \setminus T \subset X$. This means that  $S = S \cap C = (X \setminus T) \cap C = C\setminus T = C \setminus (T \cap C)$, and since $T \cap C$ is open in $(C,\tau_{sub})$ by definition of the subspace topology, this means that $S \subset C$ is closed in $(C, \tau_{sub})$.

A special role in the theory is played by the "irreducible" closed subspaces:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClosedIrreducible}
###### Definition
**([[irreducible closed subspace]])**

A [[closed subset]] $S \subset X$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of a [[topological space]] $X$ is called _[[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]]_ if it is
[[inhabited|non-empty]] and not the [[union]] of two closed proper (i.e. smaller) subsets. In other words,
a [[inhabited|non-empty]] closed subset $S \subset X$ is irreducible if whenever
$S_1, S_2 \subset X$ are two [[closed subspace]] such that

$$
  S = S_1 \cup S_2
$$

then $S_1 = S$ or $S_2 = S$.

+-- {: .num_example #IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}
###### Example
**(closures of points are irreducible)**

For $x \in X$ a [[point]] inside a [[topological space]], then
the [[topological closure|closure]] $Cl(\{x\})$ of the [[singleton]] [[subset]] $\{x\} \subset X$
is [[irreducible closed subset|irreducible]] (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible}).

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example
**(no nontrivial closed irreducibles in metric spaces)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]], regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).
Then every point $x \in X$ is closed (def \ref{ClosedSubset}),
hence every singleton subset $\{x\} \subset X$ is irreducible according to def. \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}.

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm})
with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}). Then for $a \lt c \subset \mathbb{R}$
the closed interval $[a,c] \subset \mathbb{R}$ (example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals} ) is _not_
irreducible, since for any $b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \lt b \lt c$ it is the union of two smaller closed subintervals:

$$
  [a,c] \,=\, [a, b] \cup [b, c]
  \,.
$$

In fact we will see below (prop. \ref{SoberFromHausdorff}) that in a metric space the singleton subsets are precisely the only
irreducible closed subsets.

=--

Often it is useful to re-express the condition of irreducibility of closed subspaces
in terms of complementary open subsets:

+-- {: .num_prop #OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}
###### Proposition
**(irreducible closed subsets in terms of prime open subsets)**

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $P \in \tau $ be a proper [[open subset]] of $X$,
hence so that the [[complement]] $F \coloneqq X\setminus P$ is a [[inhabited|non-empty]] [[closed subspace]]. Then $F$
is [[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]] in the sense of def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible} precisely if whenever $U_1,U_2 \in \tau$ are open subsets
with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ then $U_1 \subset P$ or $U_2 \subset P$:

$$
  \left(
    X \setminus P \,\,\text{irreducible}
  \right)
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{U_1, U_2 \in \tau}{\forall }
    \left(

      \;\Rightarrow\;
      \left(U_1 \subset P \;\text{or}\; U_2 \subset P\right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The open subsets $P \subset X$ with this property are also called the _prime open subsets_ in $\tau_X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that every [[closed subset]] $F_i \subset F$ may be exhibited as the [[complement]]

$$
  F_i = F \setminus U_i
$$

of some open subset $U_i \in \tau$ with respect to $F$. Observe that under this identification the condition
that $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_1 \cup F_2 = F$,
because it is equivalent to the equation labeled $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  F_1 \cup F_2
  & =
  (F \setminus U_1) \cup (F \setminus U_2)
  \\
  &
  = \left( X \setminus (P \cup U_1) \right) \cup \left( X \setminus P \cup U_2 \right)
  \\
  & = X \setminus
  \left(
    \left(
      P \cup U_1
    \right)
    \cap
    \left(
      P \cup U_2
    \right)
  \right)
  \\
  & = X \setminus ( P \cup (U_1 \cap U_2)  )
  \\
  & \stackrel{(\star)}{=}   X \setminus P
  \\
  & = F
  \,.
\end{aligned}
\,.
$$

Similarly, the condition that $U_i \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_i = F$,
because it is equivalent to the equality $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equalities:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F_i &= F \setminus U_i
    \\
    & = X \setminus ( P \cup U_i )
    \\
    & \stackrel{(\star)}{=} X \setminus P
    \\
    & =
    F
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Under these identifications, the two conditions are manifestly the same.

We consider yet another equivalent characterization of irreducible closed subsets,
prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} below, which will be needed in the
discussion of the [[separation axioms]] further [below](#SeparationAxioms).
Stating this requires the following concept of "[[frame]]" [[homomorphism]],
the natural kind of [[homomorphisms]] between [[topological spaces]] if we were to forget the
underlying set of points of a topological space, and only remember the set $\tau_X$ with its
operations induced by taking finite intersections and arbitrary unions:

and hence in order for this to co-restrict to $\tau_X \subset P(X)$ when restricted to $\tau_Y \subset P(Y)$
we need to demand that, under $f$, pre-images of open subsets of $Y$ are open subsets of $Z$.

  \,.
$$

=--

See also ([Johnstone 82, II 1.3](#Johnstone82)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First we need to show that the function is well defined in that given
a frame homomorphism $\phi \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ then  $X \setminus U_\emptyset(\phi)$
is indeed an irreducible closed subspace.

To that end observe that:

$(\ast)$ _If there are two elements $U_1, U_2 \in \tau_X$ with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$
then $U_1 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ or $U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$._

This is because

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2)
    & =
    \phi(U_1 \cap U_2)
    \\
    & \subset \phi(U_{\emptyset}(\phi))
    \\
    & =
    \emptyset
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where the first equality holds because $\phi$ preserves finite intersections by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}, the inclusion holds because $\phi$ respects
inclusions by remark \ref{PreservationOfInclusionsByFrameHomomorphism}, and the second equality holds because $\phi$ preserves arbitrary unions
by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}.
But in $\tau_\ast = \{\emptyset, \{1\}\}$ the intersection of two open subsets is empty precisely if at least one of them is empty,
hence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$ or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$. But this means that $U_1 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ or $U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$, as claimed.

Now according to prop. \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}
the condition $(\ast)$ identifies the [[complement]]
$X \setminus U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ as an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(X,\tau)$.

Conversely, given an irreducible closed subset $X \setminus U_0$, define $\phi$ by

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  U
    \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{if} \, U \subset U_0
      \\
      \{1\} & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This does preserve

1. arbitrary unions

   because $\phi(\underset{i}{\cup} U_i) = \{\emptyset\}$ precisely if $\underset{i}{\cup}U_i \subset U_0$ which is the
   case precisely if all $U_i \subset U_0$, which means that all $\phi(U_i) = \emptyset$ and because $\underset{i}{\cup}\emptyset = \emptyset$;

   while $\phi(\underset{i}{\cup}U_1) = \{1\}$ as soon as one of the $U_i$ is not contained in $U_0$, which means that
   one of the $\phi(U_i) = \{1\}$ which means that $\underset{i}{\cup} \phi(U_i) = \{1\}$;

1. finite intersections

   because if $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U_0$, then by $(\ast)$ $U_1 \in U_0$ or $U_2 \in U_0$, whence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$
   or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$, whence with $\phi(U_1 \cap U_2) = \emptyset$ also $\phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2) = \emptyset$;

   while if $U_1 \cap U_2$ is not contained in $U_0$ then neither $U_1$ nor $U_2$ is contained in $U_0$ and hence with
   $\phi(U_1 \cap U_2) = \{1\}$ also $\phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2) = \{1\} \cap \{1\} = \{1\}$.

Hence this is indeed a frame homomorphism $\tau_X \to \tau_\ast$.

Finally, it is clear that these two operations are inverse to each other.

Before looking at first examples of continuous functions [below](#ContinuousFunctionsExamples)
we consider now an informal remark
on the resulting global structure, the "[[category of topological spaces]]", remark \ref{TopCategory} below.
This is a language that serves to make transparent key phenomena in [[topology]]
which we encounter further below, such as the [Tn-reflection](#HausdorffReflections) (remark \ref{ReflectiveSubcategory} below),
and the [universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions).

###### Remark
**([[concrete category|concrete]] [[category of topological spaces]])**

For $X_1, X_2, X_3$ three [[topological spaces]] and for

$$
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_2 \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} X_3
$$

two [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) then their [[composition]]

$$
  f_2 \circ f_1
  \;\colon\;
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2 \overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow} X_3
$$

is clearly itself again a continuous function from $X_1$ to $X_3$.

Moreover, this composition operation is clearly _[[associativity|associative]]_, in that for

$$
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_2 \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} X_3
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}

three [[continuous functions]], then

  f_3 \circ (f_2 \circ f_1)
   =
  (f_3 \circ f_2) \circ f_1
  \;\colon\;
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_4
  \,.
$$

Finally, the composition operation is also clearly _[[unitality|unital]]_, in that for
each topological space $X$ there exists the [[identity]] function $id_X \colon X \to X$
and for $f \colon X_1 \to X_2$ any continuous function then

$$
  id_{X_2} \circ f  \;=\; f \;=\; f \circ id_{X_1}
  \,.
$$

One summarizes this situation by saying that:

1. [[topological spaces]] constitute the _[[objects]]_,

1. [[continuous functions]] constitute the _[[morphisms]]_ ([[homomorphisms]])

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AssociativityDiagram.png" width="400">
</div>

of  a _[[category]]_, called the _[[category of topological spaces]]_ ("[[Top]]" for short).

It is useful to depict collections of [[objects]] with [[morphisms]] between them
by [[diagrams]], like this one:

$\,$

$\,$

$\,$

> graphics grabbed from [Lawvere-Schanuel 09](#category+theory#LawvereSchanuel09).

There are other categories. For instance there is the [[category of sets]] ("[[Set]]" for short) whose

1. [[objects]] are [[sets]],

1. [[morphisms]] are plain [[functions]] between these.

The two categories [[Top]] and [[Set]] are different, but related. After all,

1. an [[object]] of [[Top]] (hence a [[topological space]]) is an [[object]] of [[Set]] (hence a [[set]])
equipped with [[extra structure]] (namely with a [[topological space|topology]]);

1. a [[morphism]] in [[Top]] (hence a [[continuous function]]) is a [[morphism]] in [[Set]] (hence a plain [[function]])
   with the [[extra property]] that it preserves this extra structure.

Hence we have the _underlying set assigning function_

$$
  \array{
    Top &\overset{U}{\longrightarrow}& Set
    \\
    \\
    (X,\tau) &\overset{\phantom{AAa}}{\mapsto}& X
  }
$$

from the [[class]] of [[topological spaces]] to the [[class]] of [[sets]]. But more is true:
every [[continuous function]] between topological spaces is, by definition,
in particular a function on underlying sets:

$$
  \array{
    Top &\overset{U}{\longrightarrow}& Set
    \\
    \\
    (X,\tau_X) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\overset{}{\mapsto}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    (Y, \tau_Y) &\underset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& Y
  }
$$

and this assignment (trivially) respects the [[composition]] of morphisms and the [[identity morphisms]].

Such a [[function]] between [[classes]] of [[objects]] of [[categories]], which is extended to a
function on the [[sets]] of [[homomorphisms]] between these objects in a way that respects [[composition]]
and [[identity morphisms]] is called a _[[functor]]_.  If we write an arrow between categories

$$
  U \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Set
$$

then it is understood that we mean not just a [[function]] between their [[classes]] of [[objects]],
but a [[functor]].

The functor $U$ at hand has the special property that it does not do
much except _[[stuff, structure, property|forgetting extra structure]]_, namely the extra structure on a
set $X$ given by a choice of topology $\tau_X$. One also speaks of a _[[forgetful functor]]_.

This is intuitively clear, and we may easily formalize it: The [[functor]] $U$ has the special property
that as a [[function]] between [[sets]] of [[homomorphisms]] ("[[hom sets]]", for short) it is [[injective function|injective]].
More in detail, given topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ then the component function of $U$
from the set of [[continuous function]] between these spaces to the set of plain functions between their underlying sets

is an [[injective function]], including the continuous functions among all functions of underlying sets.

A [[functor]] with this property, that its component functions
between all [[hom-sets]] are injective, is called a _[[faithful functor]]_.

A [[category]] equipped with a [[faithful functor]] to [[Set]] is called a _[[concrete category]]_.

Hence [[Top]] is canonically a [[concrete category]].

###### Example
**([[product topological space]] construction is [[functor|functorial]])**

For $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ two [[categories]] as in remark \ref{TopCategory}
(for instance [[Top]] or [[Set]]) then we obtain a new category denoted $\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{D}$
and called their _[[product category]]_ whose

1. [[objects]] are [[pairs]] $(c,d)$ with $c$ an object of $\mathcal{C}$ and $d$ an object of $\mathcal{D}$;

* [[morphisms]] are [[pairs]] $(f,g) \;\colon\; (c,d) \to (c', d')$ with $f \colon c \to c'$ a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$
and $g \colon d \to d'$ a morphism of $\mathcal{D}$,

* [[composition]] of morphisms is defined pairwise $(f', g') \circ (f,g) \coloneqq ( f' \circ f, g' \circ g )$.

This concept secretly underlies the construction of [[product topological spaces]]:

Let $(X_1,\tau_{X_1})$, $(X_2, \tau_{X_2})$, $(Y_1, \tau_{Y_1})$ and $(Y_2, \tau_{Y_2})$ be [[topological spaces]].
Then for all [[pairs]] of [[continuous functions]]

$$
  f_1 \;\colon\; (X_1, \tau_{X_1}) \longrightarrow (Y_1, \tau_{Y_1})
$$

and

$$
  f_2 \;\colon\; (X_2, \tau_{X_2}) \longrightarrow (Y_2, \tau_{Y_2})
$$

the canonically induced function on [[Cartesian products]] of sets

$$
  \array{
    X_1 \times X_2 & \overset{  f_1 \times f_2 }{\longrightarrow} & Y_1 \times Y_2
    \\
    (x_1, x_2) &\mapsto& ( f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2) )
  }
$$

is clearly a [[continuous function]] with respect to the [[product topological spaces|binary product space topologies]]
(def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})

$$
  f_1 \times f_2
    \;\colon\;
  (X_1 \times X_2, \tau_{X_1 \times X_2})
    \longrightarrow
  (Y_1 \times Y_2, \tau_{Y_1 \times Y_2})
  \,.
$$


Moreover, this construction respects [[identity functions]] and [[composition]] of functions
in both arguments.

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), this is summarized
by saying that the [[product topological space]] construction $(-) \times (-)$ extends to a _[[functor]]_
from the [[product category]] of the [[category]] [[Top]] with itself to itself:

$$
  (-) \times (-)
    \;\colon\;
  Top \times Top
    \longrightarrow
  Top

### Examples
 {#ContinuousFunctionsExamples}

We discuss here some basic examples of [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) between [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) to get a feeling for the nature of the concept.
But as with topological spaces themselves, continuous functions between them
are ubiquituous in mathematics, and no list will exhaust all classes of examples. Below in the section
_[Universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions)_ we discuss a general principle that serves to
produce examples of continuous functions with prescribed "[[universal properties]]".


+-- {: .num_example #TerminalityOfThePoint}
###### Example
**(point space is [[terminal object|terminal]])**

For $(X,\tau)$ any [[topological space]], then there is a _unique_ continuous function

1. from the [[empty topological space]] (def. \ref{Point}) $X$

   $$
     \emptyset
       \overset{\phantom{AA} \exists ! \phantom{AA} }{\longrightarrow}
     X
   $$

1. from $X$ to the [[point topological space]] (def. \ref{Point}).

   $$
     X \overset{\phantom{AA} \exists ! \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} \ast
   $$



In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), this
says that

1. the [[empty topological space]] is the _[[initial object]]_

1. the [[point space]] $\ast$ is the _[[terminal object]]_

in the [[category]] [[Top]] of topological spaces. We come back to this below in example \ref{TerminalInitialObject}.

+-- {: .num_example #PointsViaContinuousFunctions}
###### Example
**([[constant functions|constant]] [[continuous functions]])**

For $(X, \tau)$ a [[topological space]] then for $x \in X$ any element of the underlying set,
there is a unique continuous function (which we denote by the same symbol)

$$
  x \;\colon\; \ast \longrightarrow X
$$

from the [[point topological space]] (def. \ref{Point}), whose image in $X$ is that element. Hence there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  \left\{
    \ast \overset{f}{\to} X
    \,\vert\, f \,\,\text{continuous}
  \right\}
    \;\simeq\;
  X
$$

between the continuous functions from the point to any topological space, and the underlying set of that topological space.

More generally, for $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ two topological spaces, then a continuous
function $X \to Y$ between them is called a _[[constant function]]_ with value some point $y \in Y$ if it
factors through the point spaces as

$$

_[[locally constant function|locally constant]]_ if every point $x \in X$ has a [[neighbourhood]] (def. \ref{Neighbourhood})
on which the function is constant.

###### Example
**([[continuous functions]] into and out of [[discrete space|discrete]] and [[codiscrete spaces]])**

Let $S$ be a [[set]] and let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Recall from example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}

1. the [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$;

1. the [[co-discrete topological space]] $CoDisc(S)$

on the underlying set $S$. Then [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) into/out of these satisfy:

1. every [[function]] (of sets) $Disc(S) \longrightarrow X$ out of a discrete space is [[continuous function|continuous]];

1. every [[function]] (of sets) $X \longrightarrow CoDisc(S)$ into a codiscrete space is [[continuous function|continuous]].

Also:

* every [[continuous function]] $(X,\tau) \longrightarrow Disc(S)$ into a discrete space is [[locally constant function|locally constant]] (def. \ref{FunctionLocallyConstant}).

+-- {: .num_example #Diagonal}
###### Example
**([[diagonal]])**

For $X$ a [[set]], its _[[diagonal]]_ $\Delta_X$ is the [[function]] from $X$
to the [[Cartesian product]] of $X$ with itsef, given by

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
     \\
     x &\mapsto& (x,x)
  }
$$



For $(X,\tau)$ a [[topological space]], then the diagonal is a [[continuous function]]
to the [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) of $X$ with itself.

$$
  \Delta_X \;\colon\; (X, \tau) \longrightarrow (X \times X, \tau_{X \times X})
  \,.
$$

To see this, it is sufficient to see that the [[preimages]] of [[basis for a topology|basic opens]] $U_1 \times U_2$
in $\tau_{X \times X}$ are in $\tau_X$. But these pre-images are the [[intersections]] $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset X$,
which are open by the axioms on the topology $\tau_X$.

+-- {: .num_example #ImageFactorization}
###### Example
**([[image factorization]])**

Let $f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]].

Write $f(X) \subset Y$ for the [[image]] of $f$
on underlying sets, and consider the resulting factorization of $f$ through $f(X)$ on underlying sets:

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  X
    \overset{\text{surjective}}{\longrightarrow}
  f(X)
    \overset{\text{injective}}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,.
$$

There are the following two ways to topologize the [[image]] $f(X)$ such as to make this a sequence of
two continuous functions:

1. By example \ref{SubspaceTopology} $f(X)$ inherits a [[topological subspace|subspace topology]] from $(Y,\tau_Y)$
which evidently makes the inclusion $f(X) \longrightarrow Y$ a [[continuous function]].

   Observe that this also makes $X \to f(X)$ a continuous function: An open subset of $f(X)$
   in this case is of the form $U_Y \cap f(X)$ for $U_Y \in \tau_Y$, and $f^{-1}( U_Y \cap f(X) ) = f^{-1}(U_Y)$,
   which is open in $X$ since $f$ is continuous.

1. By example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace} $f(X)$ inherits a [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] from $(X,\tau_X)$
   which evidently makes the surjection $X \longrightarrow f(X)$ a [[continuous function]].

   Observe that this also makes $f(X) \longrightarrow Y$ a continuous function: The preimage under this map of an
   open subset $U_Y \in \tau_Y$ is the restriction $U_Y \cap f(X)$, and the pre-image of that under $X \to f(X)$ is
   $f^{-1}(U_Y)$, as before, which is open since $f$ is continuous, and therefore $U_Y \cap f(X)$ is open in the
   quotient topology.

Beware, in general a continuous function itself (as opposed to its [[pre-image]] function) neither
preserves [[open subsets]], nor [[closed subsets]], as the following examples show:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R} &\overset{const_a}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    x &\mapsto& a

(example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology}). Then the [[identity function]] on the underlying sets

$$
  id_{\mathbb{R}} \;\colon\; Disc(\mathbb{R}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}

is a [[continuous function]] (a special case of example \ref{ContinuousFunctionsIntoCoDiscreteTopologicalSpaces}).
A [[singleton set|singleton]] [[subset]] $\{a\} \in Disc(\mathbb{R})$ is open, but regarded as a subset
$\{a\} \in \mathbb{R}$ it is not open.

maps all of $\mathbb{R}$ (which is a closed subset, since $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \setminus \emptyset$) to

then so its its [[image]] projection $X \to f(X) \subset Y$, respectively, for $f(X) \subset Y$ regarded with its

If $f$ is an open map, and $O \subset X$ is an open subset, so that $f(O) \subset Y$ is also open in $Y$, then, since $f(O) = f(O) \cap f(X)$, it is also still open in the subspace topology, hence $X \to f(X)$ is an open map.

If $f$ is a closed map, and $C \subset X$ is a closed subset so that also $f(C) \subset Y$ is a closed subset, then the [[complement]] $Y \setminus f(C)$ is open in $Y$ and  hence $(Y \setminus f(C)) \cap f(X) = f(X) \setminus f(C)$ is open in the subspace topology, which means that $f(C)$ is closed in the subspace topology.

precisely if $f$ sends open and $f$-[[saturated subsets]] in $X$ (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated}) to open subsets of $Y$.
By lemma \ref{ComplementOfSaturatedSubsetIsSaturated} this is the case precisely if it sends
closed and $f$-saturated subsets to closed subsets.

**(saturated open neighbourhoods of saturated closed subsets under closed maps)**

Let

1. $f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ be a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap});

1. $C \subset X$ be a [[closed subset]] of $X$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) which is $f$-[[saturated subset|saturated]] (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated});

1. $U \supset C$ be an [[open subset]] containing $C$;

then there exists a smaller open subset $V$ still containing $C$

$$
  U \supset V \supset C
$$

and such that $V$ is still $f$-[[saturated subset|saturated]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We claim that the [[complement]] of $X$ by the $f$-saturation (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated}) of the complement of $X$ by $U$

$$
  V \coloneqq X \setminus \left(  f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \setminus U \right)  \right) \right)
$$

has the desired properties. To see this, observe first that

1. the [[complement]] $X \setminus U$ is closed, since $U$ is assumed to be open;

1. hence the image $f(X\setminus U)$ is closed, since $f$ is assumed to be a closed map;

1. hence the pre-image $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \setminus U \right)\right)$ is closed, since $f$ is continuous
   (using prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}), therefore its complement $V$ is indeed open;

1. this pre-image $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \setminus U \right) \right)$ is saturated (by example \ref{PreImagesAreSaturatedSubsets})
   and hence also its complement $V$ is saturated (by lemma \ref{ComplementOfSaturatedSubsetIsSaturated}).

Therefore it now only remains to see that $U \supset V \supset C$.

By [[de Morgan's law]] (prop. \ref{deMorgan}) the inclusion $U \supset V$ is equivalent to the inclusion $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \setminus U \right)\right) \supset X \setminus U$,
which is clearly the case.

The inclusion $V \supset C$ is equivalent to
$f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \setminus U \right) \right) \,\cap \, C = \emptyset$.
Since $C$ is saturated by assumption, this is
equivalent to $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \setminus U \right)\right) \,\cap \, f^{-1}(f(C)) = \emptyset$.
This in turn holds precisely if $f\left(  X \setminus U \right) \,\cap \, f(C)  = \emptyset$.
Since $C$ is saturated, this holds precisely if $X \setminus U \cap C = \emptyset$, and this is true by the assumption
that $U \supset C$.

### Homeomorphisms
 {#Homeomorphisms}


With the [[objects]] ([[topological spaces]]) and the [[morphisms]] ([[continuous functions]]) of the [[category]] [[Top]] thus defined
(remark \ref{TopCategory}), we obtain the concept of "sameness" in topology. To make this precise, one says that a [[morphism]]

$$
  X \overset{f}{\to} Y
$$

in a [[category]] is an _[[isomorphism]]_ if there exists a morphism going the other way around

$$
  X \overset{g}{\longleftarrow} Y
$$

which is an [[inverse]] in the sense that both its [[compositions]] with $f$ yield an [[identity morphism]]:

$$
  f \circ g = id_Y \;\;\;\;\; and \;\;\;\;\; g \circ f = id_X
  \,.
$$

Since such $g$ is unique if it exsist, one often writes "$f^{-1}$" for this [[inverse morphism]].


+-- {: .num_defn #Homeomorphism}
###### Definition
**([[homeomorphisms]])**


An [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] (remark \ref{TopCategory})
of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) with [[continuous functions]] between them (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps})
is called a _[[homeomorphism]]_.

Hence a _[[homeomorphism]]_ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

between two [[topological spaces]] $(X,\tau_X)$, $(Y,\tau_Y)$
such that there exists another continuous function the other way around

$$
  (X, \tau_X) \longleftarrow (Y, \tau_Y) \;\colon\; g
$$

such that their [[composition|composites]] are the [[identity functions]] on $X$ and $Y$,
respectively:

$$
  f \circ g = id_{Y} \;\;\;and\;\;\; g \circ f = id_{X}
  \,.
$$


<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Homeomorphism.png" width="560">

> graphics grabbed from [Munkres 75](#Munkres75)

We notationally indicate that a continuous function is a homeomorphism by the symbol "$\simeq$".

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X,\tau_X) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} (Y,\tau_Y)
  \,.
$$

If there is _some_, possibly unspecified, homeomorphism between topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$,
then we also write

$$
  (X,\tau_X) \,\simeq\, (Y,\tau_Y)
$$

and say that the two topological spaces _are homeomorphic._

A [[property]]/[[predicate]] $P$ of [[topological spaces]] which is [[invariant]] under homeomorphism in that

$$
  \left(
     (X, \tau_X)

  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
    P(X,\tau_X)

    P(Y,\tau_Y)
  \right)

is called a _[[topological property]]_ or _topological invariant_.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(notation for homeomorphisms)**

Beware the following notation:


1. In [[topology]] the notation $f^{-1}$ generally refers to the [[pre-image]] function of a given [[function]] $f$,
while if $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}), it is also used for the [[inverse function]] of $f$.
This abuse of notation is convenient: If $f$ happens to be a homeomorphism, then the pre-image of a subsets under
$f$ is its image under the inverse function $f^{-1}$.

1. Many authors strictly distinguish the symbols "$\cong$" and "$\simeq$" and use the _former_ to denote
homeomorphisms and the latter to refer to [[homotopy equivalences]] (which we consider in [[Introduction to Topology -- 2|part 2]]).
We use either symbol (but mostly "$\simeq$") for "[[isomorphism]]" in whatever the ambient [[category]] may be
and try to make that context always unambiguously explicit.

###### Remark

If $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) with inverse coninuous function $g$, then


1. also $g$ is a homeomophism, with inverse continuous function $f$;

1. the underlying function of sets $f \colon X \to Y$ of a homeomorphism $f$ is necessarily a [[bijection]], with inverse bijection $g$.

=--

But beware that not every [[continuous function]] which is [[bijection|bijective]] on underlying sets
is a homeomorphism. While an [[inverse function]] $g$ will exists on the level of functions of sets, this inverse may fail
to be continuous:

+-- {: .num_example #ExponentialMapFromHalfOpenIntervalToCircle}
###### Counter Example

Consider the [[continuous function]]

$$
  \array{
    [0,2\pi) &\longrightarrow& S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2
    \\
    t &\mapsto& (cos(t), sin(t))
  }
$$

from the [[half-open interval]] (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) to the unit circle $S^1 \coloneqq S_0(1) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}), regarded as a [[topological subspace]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology})
of the [[Euclidean plane]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

The underlying function of sets of $f$ is a [[bijection]]. The [[inverse function]] of sets however fails to be continuous
at $(1,0) \in S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Hence this $f$ is _not_ a [[homeomorphism]].

Indeed, below we see that the two topological spaces $[0,2\pi)$ and $S^1$ are distinguished by
[[topological invariants]], meaning that they cannot be homeomorphic via _any_ (other) choice of homeomorphism.
For example $S^1$ is a [[compact topological space]]
(def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace})
while $[0,2\pi)$ is not, and $S^1$ has a non-trivial [[fundamental group]], while that of $[0,2\pi)$
is trivial ([this prop.](Introduction+to+Topology+--+2#FundamentalGroup)).

=--

Below in example \ref{ContinuousBijectionFromClosedIntervalToCircle} we discuss a practical criterion under which continuous bijections are homeomorphisms after all. But immediate from the definitions is the following characterization:

+-- {: .num_prop #HomeoContinuousOpenBijection}
###### Proposition
**([[homeomorphisms]] are the [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[open map|open]] [[bijections]])

Let $f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]]
between [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}). Then the following are equivalence:

1. $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]];

1. $f$ is a [[bijection]] and an [[open map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap});

1. $f$ is a [[bijection]] and a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear from the definition that a homeomorphism in particular has to be a bijection.
The condition that the [[inverse function]] $Y \leftarrow X \colon g$ be continuous means
that the [[pre-image]] function of $g$ sends open subsets to open subsets. But by $g$ being the inverse to
$f$, that pre-image function is equal to $f$, regarded as a function on subsets:

$$
  g^{-1} = f \;\colon\; P(X) \to P(Y)
  \,.
$$

Hence $g^{-1}$ sends opens to opens precisely if $f$ does, which is the case precisely if $f$ is an open map,
by definition.
This shows the equivalence of the first two items. The equivalence between the first and the third follows
similarly via prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}.

=--


$\,$


Now we consider some actual **examples** of [[homeomorphisms]]:


+-- {: .num_example #ConcreteAndAbstractPoint}
###### Example
**(concrete point homeomorphic to abstract point space)**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[inhabited|non-empty]] [[topological space]], and let $x \in X$ be any point.
Regard the corresponding [[singleton]] [[subset]] $\{x\} \subset X$ as equipped with its
[[topological subspace|subspace topology]] $\tau_{\{x\}}$ (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}). Then this is
[[homomorphism|homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) to the abstract [[point space]] from example \ref{Point}:

$$
  (\{x\}, \tau_{\{x\}} ) \,\simeq\, \ast
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_example #OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn}
###### Example
**(open interval homeomorphic to the real line)**

Regard the [[real line]] as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Then the open [[interval]] $(-1,1) \subset \mathbb{R}$ (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals})
regarded with its [[subspace topology]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) is [[homeomorphic]] (def.\ref{Homeomorphism}) to all of the [[real line]]

$$
  (-1,1) \,\simeq\, \mathbb{R}^1
  \,.
$$

An [[inverse]] pair of [[continuous functions]] is for instance given (via example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}) by


$$
  \array{
    f &\colon&  \mathbb{R}^1 &\longrightarrow& (-1,+1)
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+ x^2}}
  }
$$

and

$$
  \array{
    g &\colon&  (-1,+1) &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}^1
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
  }
  \,.
$$

But there are many other choices for $f$ and $g$ that yield a homeomorphism.

Similarly, for all $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$

1. the [[open intervals]] $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$
(example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) equipped with their [[topological subspace|subspace topology]]
are all homeomorphic to each other,

1. the closed intervals $[a,b]$ are all homeomorphic to each other,

1. the half-open intervals of the form $[a,b)$ are all homeomophic to each other;

1. the half-open intervals of the form $(a,b]$ are all homeomophic to each other.

Generally, every [[open ball]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) is [[homeomorphic]] to all of $\mathbb{R}^n$:

$$
  \left(
    B^\circ_0(\epsilon) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
  \right)
   \,\simeq\,
  \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

=--

While mostly the interest in a given homeomorphism is in it being
non-obvious from the definitions, many homeomorphisms that appear
in practice exhibit "obvious re-identifications" for which it is
of interest to leave them _consistently implicit_:


+-- {: .num_example #CartesianSymmetricMonoidalTop}
###### Example
**(homeomorphisms between iterated product spaces)**


Let $(X,\tau_X)$, $(Y,\tau_Y)$ and $(Z, \tau_Z)$ be [[topological spaces]].

Then:

1. There is an evident [[homeomorphism]] between the two ways of bracketing the three factors when forming their
   [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}), called the _[[associator]]_:

   $$
     \alpha_{X,Y,Z}
       \;\colon\;
     \left(
       (X, \tau_X) \times (Y, \tau_Y)
     \right)
     \times
     (Z, \tau_Z)
       \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
     (X,\tau_X)
      \times
     \left(
       (Y,\tau_Y)
        \times
       (Z, \tau_Z)
     \right)
     \,.
   $$

1. There are evident [[homeomorphism]] between $(X,\tau)$ and its [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) with the [[point space]] $\ast$ (example \ref{Point}), called the left and right _[[unitors]]_:

   $$
     \lambda_X \;\colon\; \ast \times (X, \tau_X)  \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} (X,\tau_X)
   $$

   and

   $$
     \rho_X \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \times \ast \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} (X, \tau_X)
     \,.
   $$

1. There is an evident [[homeomorphism]] between the results of the two orders in which to form their [[product topological spaces]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}), called the _[[braiding]]_:

   $$
     \beta_{X,Y}
       \;\colon\;
     (X,\tau_X) \times (Y,\tau_Y)
       \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
     (Y,\tau_Y) \times (X, \tau_X)
     \,.
   $$

Moreover, all these homeomorphisms are compatible with each other, in that they make the
following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]] (recall remark \ref{TopCategory}):

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), all this is summarized by
saying that the the [[functor|functorial]] construction $(-) \times (-)$ of [[product topological spaces]]
(example \ref{FunctorialProductSpace})
gives the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] the [[structure]] of a
_[[monoidal category]]_ which moreover is _[[symmetric monoidal category|symmetrically]] [[braided monoidal category|braided]]_.

From this, a basic result of [[category theory]], the _[[coherence theorem for monoidal categories|MacLane coherence theorem]]_, guarantees that there is
no essential ambiguity re-backeting arbitrary iterations of the binary product topological space construction,
as long as the above homeomorphsims are understood.

Accordingly, we may write

$$
  (X_1, \tau_1)
    \times
  (X_2, \tau_2)
    \times
  \cdots
    \times
  (X_n, \tau_n)
$$

for iterated [[product topological spaces]] without putting parenthesis.

The following are a sequence of examples all of the form that an abstractly
constructed topological space is homeomorphic to a certain subspace of a Euclidean space.
These examples are going to be useful in further developments below, for example
in the [proof below](#BorelHeineProof) of the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] (prop. \ref{BorelHeine}).

* _[[product topological space|Products]] of [[intervals]] are homeomorphic to [[cube|hypercubes]]_ (example \ref{ClosedIntervalsProduct}).

* _The [[closed interval]] glued at its endpoints is homeomorphic to the [[circle]]_ (example \ref{HomeomorphismBetweenTopologicalAndCombinatorialCircle}).

* _The [[cylinder]], the [[Möbius strip]] and the [[torus]] are all homeomorphic to [[quotient spaces|quotients]] of the square_ (example \ref{SquareToCyclinderTorusAndMoebius}).

###### Example
**(product of closed intervals homeomorphic to hypercubes)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $[a_i, b_i] \subset \mathbb{R}$ for $i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}$
be $n$ [[closed intervals]] in the [[real line]] (example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}), regarded as [[topological subspaces]] of the
1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]]
(example \ref{MetricTopology}). Then the [[product topological space]]
(def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{CartesianSymmetricMonoidalTop})
of all these intervals is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism})
to the corresponding [[topological subspace]] of the $n$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}):

###### Proof

There is a canonical [[bijection]] between the underlying sets.
It remains to see that this, as well and its inverse, are [[continuous functions]].
For this it is sufficient to see that under this bijection the defining [[basis of a topology|basis]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase})
for the [[product topological space|product topology]] is also a basis for the [[topological subspace|subspace topology]].
But this is immediate from lemma \ref{RecognizingTopologicalBasis}.

+-- {: .num_example #HomeomorphismBetweenTopologicalAndCombinatorialCircle}
###### Example
**(closed interval glued at endpoints homeomorphic circle)**

As topological spaces, the [[closed interval]] $[0,1]$ (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) with its two endpoints identified is [[homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) to the standard [[circle]]:

$$
  [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)} \;\; \simeq \;\; S^1
  \,.
$$

More in detail: let

$$
  S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2
$$

be the unit [[circle]] in the [[plane]]

$$
  S^1 = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2, x^2 + y^2 = 1\}
$$

equipped with the [[subspace topology]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$,
which is itself equipped with its standard [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Moreover, let

$$
  [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}
$$

be the [[quotient topological space]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) obtained from the [[interval]] $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}^1$ with its [[subspace topology]] by applying the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies the two endpoints (and nothing else).

Consider then the function

$$
  f \;\colon\; [0,1] \longrightarrow S^1
$$

given by

$$
  t \mapsto (cos(t), sin(t))
  \,.
$$

This has the property that $f(0) = f(1)$, so that it descends to the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  \array{
    [0,1] &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
    \\
    && S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

We claim that $\tilde f$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (definition \ref{Homeomorphism}).

First of all it is immediate that $\tilde f$ is a [[continuous function]]. This follows immediately from the fact that $f$ is a [[continuous function]] and by definition of the [[quotient topology]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

So we need to check that $\tilde f$ has a continuous inverse function. Clearly the restriction of $f$ itself to the open interval $(0,1)$ has a continuous inverse. It fails to have a continuous inverse on $[0,1)$ and on $(0,1]$ and fails to have an inverse at all on [0,1], due to the fact that $f(0) = f(1)$. But the relation quotiented out in $[0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}$ is exactly such as to fix this failure.

and the $n$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}):

This homeomorphism is given by "[[stereographic projection]]":
One thinks of both the $n$-sphere as well as the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ as [[topological subspaces]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ in the standard way (example \ref{SpheresAndDisks}), such that they [[intersection|intersect]] in the [[equator]] of the $n$-sphere. For $p \in S^n$ one of the corresponding poles, then the homeomorphism is the
function which sends a point $x \in S^{n}\setminus \{p\}$ along the line connecting it with $p$ to
the point $y$ where this line intersects tfhe equatorial plane.

In the canonical ambient [[coordinates]] this [[stereographic projection]] is given as follows:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \supset \;\;\;
    &
    S^n \setminus (1,0, \cdots, 0)
      &\overset{\phantom{AA} \simeq \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbb{R}^{n}
    &
    \;\;\;
    \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
    \\

    (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\mapsto}&
    \frac{1}{1 - x_1}
    \left(
      0 , x_2, \cdots, x_{n+1}
    \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider more generally the stereographic projection

$$
  \sigma
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \backslash (1,0,\cdots, 0)
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^n
   =
  \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n.1} \,\vert\, x_1 = 0 \}
$$

of the entire ambient space minus the point $p$ onto the equatorial plane, still given by mapping a point $x$ to the unique point $y$ on the equatorial hyperplane such that the points $p$, $x$ any $y$ sit on the same straight line.

This condition means that there exists $d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$
  p +  d(x-p) = y
  \,.
$$

Since the only condition on $y$ is that $y_1 = 0$ this implies that

$$
  p_1 + d(x_1-p_1) = 0
  \,.
$$

This equation has a unique solution for $d$ given by

$$
  d = \frac{1}{1 - x_1}
$$

and hence it follow that

$$
  \sigma(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    =
  \frac{1}{1-x_1}(0,x_2, \cdots, x_n)
  \,
$$

Since [[rational functions are continuous]] (example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}), this function $\sigma$ is continuous and since the topology on $S^n\backslash p$ is the [[subspace topology]] under the canonical embedding $S^n \backslash p \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \backslash p$ it follows that the restriction

$$
  \sigma\vert_{S^n \backslash p}
    \;\colon\;
  S^n\backslash p
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^n
$$

is itself a [[continuous function]] (because its pre-images are the restrictions of the pre-images of $\sigma$ to $S^n\backslash p$).

To see that $\sigma \vert_{S^n \backslash p}$ is a [[bijection]] of the underlying sets we need to show that for every

$$
  (0, y_2, \cdots, y_{n+1})
$$

there is a unique $(x_1, \cdots , x_{n+1})$ satisfying

1. $(x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1}) \in S^{n} \backslash \{p\}$, hence

   1. $x_1 \lt 1$;

   1. $\underoverset{i = 1}{n+1}{\sum} (x_i)^2 = 1$;

1. $\underset{i \in \{2, \cdots, n+1\}}{\forall} \left(y_i = \frac{x_i}{1-x_1} \right)$.

The last condition uniquely fixes the $x_{i \geq 2}$ in terms of the given $y_{i \geq 2}$ and the remaining $x_1$, as

$$
  x_{i \geq 2} = y_i \cdot (1-x_1)
  \,.
$$

With this, the second condition says that


$$
  (x_1)^2 + (1-x_1)^2 \underset{r^2}{\underbrace{\underoverset{i = 2}{n+1}{\sum}(y_i)^2}} = 1
$$

hence equivalently that

$$
  (r^2 + 1) (x_1)^2 - (2 r^2) x_1 + (r^2 - 1) = 0
  \,.
$$

By the [[quadratic formula]] the solutions of this equation are

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    x_1
      & =
    \frac
      { 2 r^2 \pm \sqrt{ 4 r^4 - 4 (r^4 - 1)  } }
      { 2 (r^2 + 1) }
    \\
    & =
    \frac
      { 2 r^2 \pm 2  }
      { 2 r^2 + 2 }
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The solution $\frac{ 2 r^2 + 2  }{ 2 r^2 + 2 } = 1$ violates the first condition above, while the solution $\frac{ 2 r^2 - 2  }{ 2 r^2 + 2 } \lt 1$ satisfies it.

Therefore we have a unique solution, given by

$$
  \left(
    \sigma\vert_{S^n \backslash \{p\}}
  \right)^{-1}(0,y_2, \cdots, y_{n+1})
  \;=\;
  \left(
    \frac{2 r^2 - 2}{2 r^2 +2}
    ,
    \left( 1- \frac{2 r^2 - 2}{2 r^2 +2} \right) y_2
    ,
    \cdots
    ,
    \left( 1- \frac{2 r^2 - 2}{2 r^2 +2} \right) y_{n+1}
  \right)
$$

In particular therefore also an [[inverse function]] to the stereographic projection exists
and is a [[rational function]], hence continuous by example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}. So we have exhibited a homeomorphism as required.

Important examples of pairs of spaces that are _not_ homeomorphic include the following:


+-- {: .num_theorem #TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension}
###### Theorem
**([[topological invariance of dimension]])**

For $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ but $n_1 \neq n_2$, then the
 [[Euclidean spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology})
 are _not_ [[homeomorphic]].

More generally, an [[open subset]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ is never homeomorphic to an open subset in $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ if $n_1 \neq n_2$.

=--

The proofs of theorem \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension} are not elementary, in contrast to how obvious the statement seems to be intuitively.
One approach is to use tools from _[[algebraic topology]]_:
One assigns [[topological invariants]] to topological spaces, notably classes in [[ordinary cohomology]]  or in [[topological K-theory]]),
quantities that are [[invariant]] under [[homeomorphism]],
and then shows that these classes coincide for $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} - \{0\}$ and for $\mathbb{R}^{n_2} - \{0\}$ precisely only
if $n_1 = n_2$.

One indication that [[topological invariance of dimension]] is not an _elementary_ consequence of the axioms of topological spaces
is that a related "intuitively obvious" statement is in fact false: One might think that there is no
_[[surjective function|surjective]]_ [[continuous function]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to  \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ if $n_1 \lt n_2$.
But there are: these are called the _[[Peano curves]]_.

## Separation axioms
 {#SeparationAxioms}

The plain definition of _[[topological space]]_ ([above](#TopologicalSpaces)) happens to admit examples where distinct points or distinct subsets of the underlying set appear as more-or-less unseparable as seen by the topology on that set.

The extreme class of examples of topological spaces in which the open subsets do not distinguish
distinct underlying points, or in fact any distinct subsets, are the [[codiscrete spaces]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}).
This does occur in practice:

+-- {: .num_example #RQuotientedByQ}
###### Example
**([[real numbers]] quotiented by [[rational numbers]])**

Consider the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded
as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology})
and consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $\mathbb{R}$ which identifies two [[real numbers]] if they
differ by a [[rational number]]:

$$
  \left(
    x \sim y
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{p/q \in \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}}{\exists}
    \left(
      x = y + p/q
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then the [[quotient topological space]] (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

$$
  \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbb{R}/\sim
$$

is a [[codiscrete topological space]] (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}),
hence its topology does not distinguish any distinct proper subsets.

=--

Here are some less extreme examples:

+-- {: .num_example #SierpinskiNonSeparated}
###### Example
**(open neighbourhoods in the Sierpinski space)**

Consider the [[Sierpinski space]] from example \ref{SierpinskiSpace}, whose underlying set consists of
two points $\{0,1\}$, and whose open subsets form the set $\tau = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\} \}$.
This means that the only (open) neighbourhood of the point $\{0\}$ is the entire space.
Incidentally, also the [[topological closure]] of $\{0\}$  (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) is the entire space.
=--

+-- {: .num_example #LineWithTwoOrigins}
###### Example
**([[line with two origins]])**

Consider the [[disjoint union space]] $\mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R}$ (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}) of two copies of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}), which is equivalently the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the [[discrete topological space]] on the 2-element set (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}):

$$
  \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R} \;\simeq\; \mathbb{R} \times Disc(\{0,1\})
$$

Moreover, consider the [[equivalence relation]] on the underlying set which identifies every
point $x_i$ in the $i$th copy of $\mathbb{R}$ with the corresponding point in the other, the $(1-i)$th copy, except when $x = 0$:

$$
  \left(
    x_i \sim y_j
  \right)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \left(
      x = y
    \right)
    \,\text{and}\,
    \left(
      \left(
        x \neq 0
      \right)
      \,\text{or}\,
      \left(
        i = j
      \right)

The [[quotient topological space]] by this equivalence relation (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

$$
  \left(
    \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R}
  \right)/\sim
$$

is called the **line with two origins**. These "two origins" are the points $0_0$ and $0_1$.

We claim that in this space _every neighbourhood of $0_0$ intersects every neighbouhood of $0_1$.

Because, by definition of the [[quotient topological space|quotient space topology]], the [[open neighbourhoods]] of $0_i \in   \left( \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R} \right)/\sim$ are precisely those that contain subsets of the form

$$
 (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_i
  \;\coloneqq\;
 (-\epsilon,0) \cup \{0_i\} \cup (0,\epsilon)
 \,.
$$

But this means that the "two origins" $0_0$ and $0_1$ may not be [separated by neighbourhoods](separation+axioms#SeparatedByNeighbourhoods), since the intersection of
$(-\epsilon, \epsilon)_0$ with $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)_i$ is always non-empty:

$$
  (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_0
   \cap
  (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_1
  \;=\;
  (-\epsilon, 0) \cup (0, \epsilon)
  \,.
$$

In many applications one wants to exclude at least some such exotic examples
of topologial spaces from the discussion and instead concentrate on those examples for which
the topology recognizes the separation of distinct points, or of more general
[[disjoint subsets]].
The relevant conditions to be imposed on top of the plain [[axioms]] of a [[topological space]] are hence known as _[[separation axioms]]_
which we discuss in the following.

These axioms are all of the form of saying that two subsets (of certain kinds) in the topological space are 'separated' from each other in one sense if they are 'separated' in a (generally) weaker sense. For example the weakest axiom (called $T_0$) demands that if two points are distinct as elements of the underlying set of points, then there exists at least one [[open subset]] that contains one but not the other.

In this fashion one may impose a hierarchy of stronger axioms. For example demanding that given two distinct points, then each of them is contained in some open subset not containing the other ($T_1$) or that such a pair of open subsets around two distinct points may in addition be chosen to be [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] ($T_2$). Below in _[Tn-spaces](TnTopologicalSpaces)_ we discuss the following hierarchy:

{#TableOfMainSeparationAxioms}
[[!include main separation axioms -- table]]

The condition, $T_2$, also called the _[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff condition]]_ is the most common among all separation axioms. Historically this axiom was originally taken as part of the definition of topological spaces,
and it is still often (but by no means always) considered by default.

However, there are respectable areas of mathematics that involve topological spaces where the Hausdorff axiom fails, but
a weaker axiom is still satisfied, called [[sober topological spaces|sobriety]].
This is the case notably in [[algebraic geometry]] ([[schemes are sober]]) and in [[computer science]] ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)).
These _[[sober topological spaces]]_ are singled out by the fact that they are entirely characterized by their
[[frame of opens|sets of open subsets]] with their union and intersection structure (as in def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens})
and may hence be understood independently from their underlying sets of points. This we discuss [further below](#SoberSpaces).

| hierarchy of [[separation axioms]]                 |
|---------------------------------------|
| $\array{ &&&\text{metric space}  \\ &&& \Downarrow \\ &&& \vdots \\ &&& \Downarrow \\ &&& T_4  = \text{normal Hausdorff} \\ &&& \Downarrow \\ &&& T_3 = \text{regular Hausdorff} \\ &&& \Downarrow \\ &&& T_2 = \text{Hausdorff}  \\ && \swArrow && \seArrow \\ \, & T_1 && && \text{sober} & \, \\ && \seArrow && \swArrow \\ &&& T_0 = \text{Kolmogorov} \\ }  $ |

All separation axioms are satisfied by [[metric spaces]] (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}, example \ref{MetricSpacesAreNormal} below), from whom the concept of topological space was originally abstracted [above](#TopologicalSpaces). Hence imposing some of them may also be understood as gauging just how far one allows topological spaces to generalize away from metric spaces




### $T_n$ spaces
 {#TnTopologicalSpaces}

There are many variants of separation axims. The classical ones are labeled $T_n$
(for German "Trennungsaxiom") with $n \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ or higher. These we now introduce in def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace} and def. \ref{NormalSpace}.

+-- {: .num_defn #HausdorffTopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**(the first three [[separation axioms]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}).

For $x \neq y \in X$ any two points in the underlying set of $X$ which are not [[equality|equal]] as elements of this set,
consider the following [[propositions]]:

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/HausdorffProperty.png" width="190">
</div>


* **(T0)** *There exists a [[neighbourhood]] of one of the two points which does not contain the other point.*

* **(T1)** *There exist [[neighbourhoods]] of both points which do not contain the other point.*

* **(T2)** *There exists [[neighbourhoods]]_ of both points which do not intersect each other.*

> graphics grabbed from [Vickers 89](#Vickers89)

The topological space $X$ is called a _$T_n$-topological space_ or just _$T_n$-space_, for short,
if it satisfies condition $T_n$ above for all pairs of distinct points.

A $T_0$-topological space is also called a _[[Kolmogorov space]]_.

A $T_2$-topological space is also called a _[[Hausdorff topological space]]_.

For definiteness, we re-state these conditions formally. Write $x,y \in X$ for points in $X$, write $U_x, U_y \in \tau$ for open [[neighbourhoods]] of these points. Then:

* **(T0**) $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left(
    \left( \underset{U_y}{\exists} \left( \{x\} \cap U_y = \emptyset \right) \right)
      \,\text{or}\,
    \left( \underset{U_x}{\exists} \left( U_x \cap \{y\} = \emptyset  \right) \right) \right)$

* **((T1)** $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left(\underset{U_x,U_y}{\exists} \left(\left( \{x\} \cap U_y = \emptyset\right)
  \, \text{and} \, \left( U_x \cap \{y\}  = \emptyset \right)\right) \right)$

* **(T2)** $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left( \underset{U_x, U_y}{\exists} \left( U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset\right) \right)$

one of them satisfies $T_n$ precisely if the other does.

Because for $x \neq y \in X$ two distinct points, then the [[distance]] $d(x,y)$ between them is [[positive number]],
by the non-degeneracy axiom in def. \ref{MetricSpace}. Accordingly the [[open balls]] (def. \ref{OpenBalls})

+-- {: .num_prop #T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints}
###### Proposition
**($T_0$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is $T_0$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace})
precisely if the function $Cl(\{-\})$ that forms [[topological closures]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of [[singleton]] [[subsets]]
from the underlying set of $X$ to the set of [[irreducible closed subsets]] of $X$ (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible},
which is well defined according to example \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}), is [[injective function|injective]]:

$$
  Cl(\{-\}) \;\colon\; X \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow} IrrClSub(X)
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume first that $X$ is $T_0$. Then we need to show that if $x,y \in X$ are such that
$Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$ then $x = y$. Hence assume that $Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$.
Since the closure of a point is the [[complement]] of the union of the open subsets not containing the point
(lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure}),
this means that the union of open subsets that do not contain $x$
is the same as the union of open subsets that do not contain $y$:

$$
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\setminus \{x\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
  \;=\;
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\setminus \{y\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
$$

But if the two points were distinct, $x \neq y$, then by $T_0$ one of the above unions would contain $x$ or $y$, while the other would not, in contradiction to the above equality. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

Conversely, assume that $\left( Cl\{x\} = Cl\{y\}\right) \Rightarrow \left( x = y\right)$, and assume that $x \neq y$.
Hence by [[contraposition]] $\mathrm{Cl}(\{x\}) \neq \mathrm{Cl}(\{y\})$. We need to show that there exists
an open set which contains one of the two points, but not the other.

Assume there were no such open subset, hence that every open subset containing one of the two points would
also contain then other. Then by lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure} this would mean
that $x \in \mathrm{Cl}(\{y\})$ and that $y \in \mathrm{Cl}(\{x\})$. But this would imply that
$Cl(\{x\}) \subset \mathrm{Cl}(\{y\})$ and that $\mathrm{Cl}(\{y\}) \subset \mathrm{Cl}(\{x\})$,
hence that $\mathrm{Cl}(\{x\}) = \mathrm{Cl}(\{y\})$. This is a [[proof by contradiction]].

Here the first step is the reformulation of closure from lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure}, the second is another application of the [[de Morgan law]] (prop. \ref{deMorgan}), the third is the definition of union and complement, and the last one is manifestly
by definition of $T_1$.

+-- {: .num_prop #T2InTermsOfClosedDiagonal}
###### Proposition
**($T_2$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau_X)$ is $T_2$=[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]]
precisely if the [[image]] of the [[diagonal]]

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
     \\
     x &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& (x,x)
  }
$$

is a [[closed subset]] in the [[product topological space]]
$(X \times X, \tau_{X \times X})$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that the Hausdorff condition is equivalently rephrased in terms of the product topology as: _Every point $(x,y) \in X$ which is not on the diagonal has an open neighbourhood $U_{(x,y)} \times U_{(x,y)}$ which still does not intersect the diagonal_, hence:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & (X,\tau)\,\text{Hausdorff}
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow
    &
  \underset{(x,y) \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta_X(X) }{\forall}
  \left(
      \underset{ { U_{(x,y)} \times V_{(x,y)} \in \tau_{X \times Y} } \atop { (x,y) \in U_{(x,y)} \times V_{(x,y)} } }{\exists}
      \left(
           U_{(x,y)} \times V_{(x,y)} \cap \Delta_X(X) = \emptyset
      \right)
  \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

Therefore if $X$ is Hausdorff, then the diagonal $\Delta_X(X) \subset X \times X$ is the complement of a union of such open sets, and hence is closed:


$$
  (X, \tau)\, \text{Hausdorff}
  \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\;
  \Delta_X(X)
  =
  X \setminus
  \left(
    \underset{(x,y) \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta_X(X)}{\cup}
    U_{(x,y)} \times V_{(x,y)}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Conversely, if the diagonal is closed, then (by lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure}) every point $(x,y) \in X \times X$ not on the diagonal, hence with $x \neq y$, has an open neighbourhood $U_{(x,y)} \times V_{(x,y)}$ still not intersecting the diagonal, hence so that $U_{(x,y)} \cap V_{(x,y)} = \emptyset$. Thus $(X,\tau)$ is Hausdorff.

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) regarded as a [[topological space]]

###### Proof

By example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace} metric spaces are $T_2$, hence in particular $T_1$.
What we need to show is that given two [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] [[closed subsets]] $C_1, C_2 \subset X$
then their exists [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[open neighbourhoods]] $U_{C_1} \subset C_1$
and $U_{C_2} \supset C_2$.

Recall the function

**($T_n$ are topological properties of increasing strength)**

The separation axioms from def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}, def. \ref{NormalSpace}
are [[topological properties]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) which imply each other as

$$
  T_4 \Rightarrow T_3 \Rightarrow T_2 \Rightarrow T_1 \Rightarrow T_0

The implications

$$
  T_2 \Rightarrow T_1 \Rightarrow T_0
$$

and

$$
  T_4 \Rightarrow T_3
$$

are immediate from the definitions. The remaining implication $T_3 \Rightarrow T_2$
follows with prop. \ref{T1InTermsOfTopologicalClosure}: This says that by assumption of $T_1$
then all points in $(X,\tau)$ are closed, and with this the condition $T_2$ is manifestly
a special case of the condition for $T_3$.

=--

Hence instead of saying "$X$ is $T_1$ and ..." one could just as well phrase
the conditions $T_3$ and $T_4$ as "$X$ is $T_2$ and ...", which would render
the proof of prop. \ref{ImplicationsAmongTheSeparationAxioms} even more trivial.

The following shows that not every $T_2$-space/Hausdorff space is $T_3$/regular

for the [[subset]] of [[natural number|natural]] [[fractions]] inside the [[real numbers]].

Define a [[topological basis]] $\beta \subset P(\mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{R}$ consisting of all the [[open intervals]] as well as the [[complements]] of $K$ inside them:

The [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_{\beta} \subset P(\mathbb{R})$ which is generated from this [[topological basis]] is called the _K-topology_.

This is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) which is not a [[regular Hausdorff space]],

###### Proposition
**($T_3$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is a [[regular Hausdorff space]] (def. \ref{NormalSpace}), precisely if
all points are closed and for all points $x \in X$ with [[open neighbourhood]] $U \supset \{x\}$ there exists a smaller open neighbourhood $V \supset \{x\}$ whose [[topological closure]] $Cl(V)$ is still contained in $U$:

$$
  \{x\} \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset U

The **proof** of prop. \ref{T3InTermsOfTopologicalClosures} is the direct  specialization of the following proof for prop. \ref{T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures} to the case that $C = \{x\}$ (using that by $T_1$, which is part of the definition of $T_3$, the singleton subset is indeed closed, by prop. \ref{T1InTermsOfTopologicalClosure}).


+-- {: .num_prop #T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures}
###### Proposition
**($T_4$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is [[normal Hausdorff space]] (def. \ref{NormalSpace}), precisely if all points are closed and for all [[closed subsets]] $C \subset X$ with [[open neighbourhood]] $U \supset C$ there exists a smaller open neighbourhood $V \supset C$ whose [[topological closure]] $Cl(V)$ is still contained in $U$:

$$
  C \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset U
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, assume that $(X,\tau)$ is normal, and consider

$$
  C \subset U
  \,.
$$

It follows that the [[complement]] of the open subset $U$ is closed and disjoint from $C$:

$$
  C \cap X \setminus U = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

Therefore by assumption of normality of $(X,\tau)$, there exist open neighbourhoods  with

$$

  V \supset C
  \,, \phantom{AA}
  W \supset X \setminus U
  \phantom{AA}
    \text{with}
  \phantom{AA}
  V \cap W = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

But this means that

$$
  V \subset X \setminus W
$$

and since the [[complement]] $X \setminus W$ of the open set $W$ is closed, it still contains the closure of $V$, so that we have

$$
  C \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset X \setminus W \subset U
$$

as required.

In the other direction, assume that for every open neighbourhood $U \supset C$ of a closed subset $C$ there exists a smaller open neighbourhood $V$ with

$$
  C \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset U
  \,.
$$

Consider disjoint closed subsets

$$
  C_1, C_2 \subset X
  \,,
  \phantom{AAA}
  C_1 \cap C_2 = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

We need to produce disjoint open neighbourhoods for them.

From their disjointness it follows that

$$
  X \setminus C_2 \supset C_1
$$

is an open neighbourhood. Hence by assumption there is an open neighbourhood $V$ with

$$
  C_1 \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset X \setminus C_2
  \,.
$$

Thus

$$
  V \supset C_1
    \,, \phantom{AAAA}
  X \setminus Cl(V) \supset C_2
$$

are two disjoint open neighbourhoods, as required.

But the $T_4$/normality axiom has yet another equivalent reformulation, which is of a different nature,
and will be important when we discuss [[paracompact topological spaces]] [below](#ParacompactSpaces):

The following concept of _[[Urysohn functions]]_ is another approach of thinking about separation
of subsets in a topological space, not in terms of their neighbourhoods, but in terms of
continuous real-valued "indicator functions" that take different values on the subsets.
This perspective will be useful when we consider [[paracompact topological spaces]] [below](#ParacompactSpaces).

But the [[Urysohn lemma]] (prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma} below) implies that this concept of separation
is in fact equivalent to that of normality of Hausdorff spaces.

Let $X$ be a [[normal Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{NormalSpace}), and let $A,B \subset X$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Beware, the Urysohn function in prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma} may take the values 0 or 1 even outside of the two subsets. The condition that the function takes value 0 or 1, respectively, _precisely_ on the two subsets corresponds to "[[perfectly normal spaces]]".

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
of [[Urysohn's lemma]], prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma}

Set

$$
  C_0 \coloneqq A
  \phantom{AAA}
  U_1 \coloneqq X \setminus B
  \,.
$$

Since by assumption

$$
  A \cap B = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

we have

$$
  C_0 \subset U_1
  \,.

$$

That $(X,\tau)$ is normal implies, by lemma \ref{T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures}, that every open neighbourhood $U \supset C$ of a closed subset $C$ contains a smaller neighbourhood $V$ together with its [[topological closure]] $Cl(V)$

$$
  U \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset C
  \,.
$$

Apply this fact successively to the above situation to obtain the following infinite sequence of nested open subsets $U_r$ and closed subsets $C_r$

$$
  \array{
    C_0 &&  &&  &&  &\subset&  &&  &&  && U_1
    \\
    C_0 &&  &\subset&  && U_{1/2} &\subset& C_{1/2} &&  &\subset&  && U_1
    \\
    C_0 &\subset& U_{1/4} &\subset& C_{1/4} &\subset& U_{1/2} &\subset& C_{1/2} &\subset& U_{3/4} &\subset& C_{3/4} &\subset& U_1
  }
$$

and so on, labeled by the [[dyadic rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}_{dy} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ within $(0,1]$

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/UrysohnConstruction.png" width="400">

$$
 \{ U_{r} \subset X \}_{r \in (0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q}_{dy}}
$$

with the property

$$
  \underset{r_1 \lt r_2 \, \in (0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q}_{dy}}{\forall}
  \left(
      U_{r_1} \subset Cl(U_{r_1}) \subset U_{r_2}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Define then the function

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow [0,1]
$$

to assign to a point $x \in X$ the [[infimum]] of the labels of those open subsets in this sequence that contain $x$:

$$
  f(x)
     \coloneqq
  \underset{U_r \supset \{x\}}{\lim} r
$$

Here the [[limit of a net|limit]] is over the [[directed set]] of those $U_r$ that contain $x$, ordered by reverse inclusion.


This function clearly has the property that $f(A) = \{0\}$  and $f(B) = \{1\}$. It only remains to see that it is continuous.

To this end, first observe that

$$
  \array{
    (\star)
    &&
    \left(
      x \in Cl(U_r)
    \right)
      &\Rightarrow&
    \left(
       f(x) \leq r
    \right)
    \\
    (\star\star)
    &&
    \left(
      x \in U_r
    \right)
      &\Leftarrow&
    \left(
      f(x) \lt r
    \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here it is immediate from the definition that $(x \in U_r) \Rightarrow (f(x) \leq r)$ and that $(f(x) \lt r) \Rightarrow (x \in U_r \subset Cl(U_r))$. For the remaining implication, it is sufficient to observe that

$$
  (x \in \partial U_r) \Rightarrow (f(x) = r)
  \,,
$$

where $\partial U_r \coloneqq Cl(U_r) \setminus U_r$ is the [[boundary]] of $U_r$.

This holds because the [[dyadic numbers]] are [[dense subset|dense]] in $\mathbb{R}$. (And this would fail if we stopped the above decomposition into $U_{a/2^n}$-s at some finite $n$.) Namely, in one direction, if $x \in \partial U_r$ then for every small positive real number $\epsilon$ there exists a dyadic rational number $r'$ with $r \lt r' \lt r + \epsilon$, and by construction $U_{r'} \supset Cl(U_r)$ hence  $x \in U_{r'}$. This implies that $\underset{U_r \supset \{x\}}{\lim} = r$.


{#PreimagesOfTheSubbaseOpens} Now we claim that for all $\alpha \in [0,1]$ then

1. $f^{-1}(\,(\alpha, 1]\,) = \underset{r \gt \alpha}{\cup} \left( X \setminus Cl(U_r) \right)$

1. $f^{-1}(\,[0,\alpha)\,) = \underset{r \lt \alpha}{\cup} U_r$

Thereby $f^{-1}(\,(\alpha, 1]\,)$ and $f^{-1}(\,[0,\alpha)\,)$ are exhibited as unions of open subsets, and hence they are open.

Now since the subsets $\{ [0,\alpha), (\alpha,1]\}_{\alpha \in [0,1]}$
form a [[topological subbase|sub-base]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}) for the Euclidean metric topology on $[0,1]$, it follows that all pre-images of $f$ are open, hence that $f$ is continuous.

### $T_n$ reflection
 {#HausdorffReflections}

While the [[topological subspace]] construction preserves the $T_n$-property  for $n \in \{0,1,2\$
(example \ref{TiSubspaces}) the construction of [[quotient topological spaces]] in general does not,
as shown by examples \ref{RQuotientedByQ} and \ref{LineWithTwoOrigins}.

Further [below](#UniversalConstructions) we will see that, generally, among all [[universal constructions]]
in the [[category]] [[Top]] of all  [[topological spaces]] those
that are [[limits]] preserve the $T_n$ property, while those that are [[colimits]] in general do not.

But at least for $T_0$, $T_1$ and $T_2$  there is a  universal way, called _[[reflective subcategory|reflection]]_ (prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection} below),
to approximate any topological space "from the left" by a $T_n$ topological spaces

Hence if one wishes to work within the [[full subcategory]] of the $T_n$-spaces
among all [[topological space]], then the correct way to construct quotients and other _[[colimits]]_
(see [below](#UniversalConstructions)) is to first construct them as usual [[quotient topological spaces]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}), and then apply the $T_n$-reflection to the result.

**($T_n$-reflection)**

Let $n \in \{0,1,2\}$. Then for every [[topological space]] $X$ there exists


1. a $T_n$-topological space $T_n X$

1. a [[continuous function]]

   $$
     t_n(X)
       \;\colon\;
     X \longrightarrow T_n X
   $$

   called the _$T_n$-reflection_ of $X$,

which is the  "closest approximation from the left" to $X$ by a $T_n$-topological space, in that
for $Y$ any $T_n$-space, then [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

are in [[bijection]] with [[continuous function]] of the form

$$
  \tilde f \;\colon\; T_n X \longrightarrow Y
$$

and such that the bijection is constituted by

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ t_n(X)
  \;\colon\;
    X
      \overset{ t_n(X)}{\longrightarrow}

    & {}_{\mathllap{t_n(X)}}\searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
    \\
    && T_n X
  }
  \,.
$$


* For $n = 0$ this is known as the _[[Kolmogorov quotient]]_ construction (see prop. \ref{KolmogorovQuotient} below).

* For $n = 2$
this is known as _[[Hausdorff reflection]]_ or _Hausdorffication_ or similar.



Moreover, the operation $T_n(-)$ extends to [[continuous functions]] $f \colon X \to Y$

$$
  (X \overset{f}{\to} Y)
    \;\mapsto\;
  (T_n X \overset{T_n f}{\to} T_n Y)
$$

such as to preserve [[composition]] of functions as well as [[identity functions]]:

$$
  T_n g \circ T_n f = T_n(g \circ f)
  \phantom{AA}
  \,,
  \phantom{AA}
  T_n id_X = id_{T_n X}
  \,
$$

Finally, the comparison map is compatible with this in that

$$
  t_n(Y) \circ f
    =
  T_n(f) \circ t_n(X)
  \phantom{AAAA}

We **prove** this via a concrete construction of $T_n$-reflection in prop. \ref{HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces} below.
But first we pause to comment on the bigger picture of the $T_n$-reflection:


+-- {: .num_remark #ReflectiveSubcategory}
###### Remark
**([[reflective subcategories]])**

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}) the $T_n$-reflection of prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}
says that

1. $T_n(-)$ is a _[[functor]]_ $T_n \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Top_{T_n}$ from the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] to the [[full subcategory]] $Top_{T_n} \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} Top$ of Hausdorff topological spaces;

1. $t_n(X) \colon X \to T_n X$ is a _[[natural transformation]]_ from the [[identity functor]] on [[Top]] to the functor $\iota \circ T_n$

1. $T_n$-topological spaces form a [[reflective subcategory]] of all [[topological spaces]] in that $T_n$ is [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion functor $\iota$; this situation is denoted as follows:

   $$
     Top_{T_n}
       \underoverset{\underset{\phantom{A}\iota\phantom{A}}{\hookrightarrow}}{\overset{\phantom{A}H\phantom{A}}{\longleftarrow}}{\bot}
     Top
     \,.
   $$

Generally, an _[[adjoint functor|adjunction]]_ between two [[functors]]

$$
  L \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \leftrightarrow \mathcal{D} \;\colon\; R
$$

is for all pairs of objects $c \in \mathcal{C}$, $d \in \mathcal{D}$ a [[bijection]] between sets of [[morphisms]] of the form

$$
  \left\{
     L(c) \longrightarrow d
  \right\}
  \phantom{A}
    \leftrightarrow
  \phantom{A}
  \left\{
    c \longrightarrow R(d)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

i.e.

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(L(c), d)
  \underoverset{\phantom{AA}\simeq \phantom{AA}}{\phi_{c,d}}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(c, R(d))
$$

and such that these bijections are "[[natural bijection|natural]]" in that they for all pairs of morphisms $f \colon c' \to c$ and $g \colon d \to d'$ then the folowing [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(L(c), d)
      &\underoverset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\phi_{c,d}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(c, R(d))
    \\
    {\mathllap{g \circ (-) \circ L(f)}}\downarrow
       &&
    \downarrow{\mathrlap{ R(g) \circ (-) \circ f }}
    \\
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(L(c'), d')
     &\underoverset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\phi_{c',d'}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{\mathcal{D}}(c', R(d'))
  }
  \,.
$$

One calls the image under $\phi_{c,L(c)}$ of the [[identity morphism]] $id_{L(x)}$ the
_[[unit of an adjunction|unit of the adjunction]]_, written

$$
  \eta_x \;\colon\; c \longrightarrow R(L(c))
  \,.
$$

One may show that it follows that the image $\tilde f$ under $\phi_{c,d}$ of a general morphism $f \colon c \to d$
(called the _[[adjunct]]_ of $f$) is given by this [[composition|composite]]:

$$
  \tilde f
    \;\colon\;
  c \overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow} R(L(c)) \overset{R(f)}{\longrightarrow} R(d)
  \,.
$$

In the case of the [[reflective subcategory]] inclusion $(T_n \dashv \iota)$ of the category of $T_n$-spaces into
the category [[Top]] of all topological spaces this adjunction unit is precisely the $T_n$-reflection
$t_n(X) \colon X \to \iota( T_n(X))$ (only that we originally left the re-embedding $\iota$ notationally implicit).

=--

$\,$

There are various ways to see the existence and to construct the $T_n$-reflections. The following is the quickest way to see the existence, even though it leaves the actual construction rather implicit.

+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}
###### Proposition
**($T_n$-reflection via explicit quotients)**


Let $n \in \{0,1,2\}$. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on the underlying set $X$
for which $x_1 \sim x_2$ precisely if for every [[surjective function|surjective]] [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ into any
$T_n$-topological space $Y$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) we have $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$:

$$
  (x_1 \sim x_2)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{ { Y \in Top_{T_n} } \atop { X \underoverset{\text{surjective}}{f}{\to} Y  }  }{\forall}
  \left(
    f(x) = f(y)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then

1. the set of [[equivalence classes]]

   $$
     T_n X \coloneqq X /{\sim}
   $$

   equipped with the [[quotient topology]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) is a $T_n$-topological space,

1. the quotient projection

   $$
     \array{
       X & \overset{t_n(X)}{\longrightarrow} &  X/{\sim}
       \\
       x &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& [x]
     }
   $$

   exhibits the $T_n$-reflection of $X$, according to prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First we observe that every continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ into a $T_n$-topological space $Y$
factors uniquely, via $t_n(X)$ through a continuous function $\tilde f$
(this makes use of the "[[universal property]]" of the quotient topology, which we dwell on a bit more below in example \ref{UniversalPropertyOfQuotientSpace}):

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ t_n(X)
$$

Clearly this continuous function $\tilde f$ is unique if it exists, because its underlying function of sets
must be given by

$$
  \tilde f \colon [x] \mapsto f(x)
  \,.
$$

First observe that this is indeed well defined as a function of underlying sets.
To that end, factor $f$ through its [[image]] $f(X)$

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow f(X) \hookrightarrow Y
$$

equipped with its [[topological subspace|subspace topology]] as a subspace of $Y$ (example \ref{ImageFactorization}). By
prop. \ref{TiSubspaces} also the image $f(X)$ is a $T_n$-topological space, since $Y$ is.
This means that if two elements $x_1, x_2 \in X$ have the same equivalence class, then, by definition of the
equivalence relation, they have the same image under _all_ comntinuous surjective functions into a $T_n$-space,
hence in particular they have the same image under $f \colon X \overset{\text{surjective}}{\longrightarrow} f(X) \hookrightarrow Y$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    ( [x_1] = [x_2]) & \Leftrightarrow\, (x_1 \sim x_2)
    \\
    & \Rightarrow\, ( f(x_1) = f(x_2) )
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

This shows that $\tilde f$ is well defined as a function between sets.

To see that $\tilde f$ is also continuous, consider $U \in Y$ an open subset. We need to show that
the pre-image $\tilde f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X/\sim$. But by definition of the [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}), this is open precisely if its pre-image under the quotient projection $t_n(X)$ is open, hence precisely if

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (t_n(X))^{-1} \left( \tilde f^{-1}\left(U\right)  \right)
    & =
    \left( \tilde f \circ t_n(X) \right)^{-1}(U)
    \\
    & =
    f^{-1}(U)
  \end{aligned}
$$

is open in $X$. But this is the case by the assumption that $f$ is continuous. Hence $\tilde f$ is indeed the unique
continuous function as required.

What remains to be seen is that $T_n X$ as constructed is indeed a $T_n$-topological space.
Hence assume that $[x] \neq [y] \in T_n X$ are two distinct points. Depending on the value of $n$,  need to produce open neighbourhoods
around one or both of these points not containing the other point and possibly disjoint to each other.

Now by definition of $T_n X$ the assumption $[x] \neq [y]$ means that there exists a $T_n$-topological space $Y$ and a surjective continuous function
$f \colon X \overset{surjective}{\longrightarrow} Y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y) \in Y$:

$$
  ( [x_1] \neq [x_2] )
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \underset{ { Y \in Top_{T_m}  \atop { X \underoverset{\text{surjective}}{f}{\longrightarrow} Y } } }{\exists}
  \left(
    f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, since $Y$ is $T_n$,
there exist the respective kinds of neighbourhoods around $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ in $Y$. Moreover, by the previous statement there
exists the continuous function $\tilde f \colon T_n X \to Y$ with $\tilde f([x_1]) = f(x_1)$ and $\tilde f([x_2]) = f(x_2)$.
By the nature of continuous functions,
the pre-images of these open neighbourhoods in $Y$ are still open in $X$ and still
satisfy the required disjunction properties. Therefore $T_n X$ is a $T_n$-space.

=--

Here are alternative constructions of the reflections:

+-- {: .num_prop #KolmogorovQuotient}
###### Proposition
**([[Kolmogorov quotient]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Consider the [[relation]] on the underlying set
by which $x_1 \sim x_2$ precisely if neither $x_i$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] not containing the other.
This is an [[equivalence relation]]. The [[quotient topological space]] $X \to X/\sim$ by this
equivalence relation (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) exhibits the $T_0$-reflection of $X$ according to prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}.

=--

A more explicit construction of the Hausdorff quotient than given by prop. \ref{HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}
is rather more involved. The issue is that the relation "$x$ and $y$ are not separated by disjoint open neighbourhoods"
is not [[transitive relation|transitive]];

+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflectionViaTransitiveClosureOfDiagonal}
###### Proposition
**(more explicit [[Hausdorff reflection]])**

For $(Y,\tau_Y)$ a [[topological space]], write $r_Y \subset Y \times Y$
for the [[transitive relation|transitive closure]] of the [[relation]] given by the [[topological closure]] $Cl(\Delta_Y)$ of the [[image]] of the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_Y \colon Y \hookrightarrow Y \times Y$.

$$
  r_Y \coloneqq Trans(Cl(Delta_Y))
  \,.
$$

Now for $(X,\tau_X)$ a [[topological space]], define by [[induction]] for each [[ordinal number]] $\alpha$ an [[equivalence relation]] $r^\alpha$ on $X$ as follows, where we write $q^\alpha \colon X \to H^\alpha(X)$ for the corresponding [[quotient topological space]] projection:

We start the induction with the trivial equivalence relation:

* $r^0_X \coloneqq \Delta_X$;

For a [[successor ordinal]] we set

* $r_X^{\alpha+1} \coloneqq \left\{ (a,b) \in X \times X  \,\vert\, (q^\alpha(a), q^\alpha(b)) \in r_{H^\alpha(X)} \right\}$

and for a [[limit ordinal]] $\alpha$ we set

* $r_X^\alpha \coloneqq \underset{\beta \lt \alpha}{\cup} r_X^\beta$.

Then:

1. there exists an ordinal $\alpha$ such that $r_X^\alpha = r_X^{\alpha+1}$

1. for this $\alpha$ then $H^\alpha(X) = H(X)$ is the Hausdorff reflection from prop. \ref{HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}.

## Sober spaces
 {#SoberSpaces}

While the original formulation of the [[separation axioms]] $T_n$ from def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace} and def. \ref{NormalSpace}
clearly does follow some kind of pattern, its equivalent reformulation in terms of closure conditions in
prop. \ref{T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints}, prop. \ref{T1InTermsOfTopologicalClosure}, prop \ref{T2InTermsOfClosedDiagonal},
prop. \ref{T3InTermsOfTopologicalClosures} and prop. \ref{T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures} suggests rather different patterns.
Therefore it is worthwhile to also consider separation-like axioms that are not among the original list.

In particular, the alternative characterization of the $T_0$-condition in prop. \ref{T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints}
immediately suggests the following strengthening, different from the $T_1$-condition (see example \ref{T1AndSoberIncomparable} below):

###### Definition
**([[sober topological space]])**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is called a _[[sober topological space]]_
precisely if every [[irreducible closed subspace]] (def. \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint})
is the [[topological closure]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of a unique point, hence precisely if the function

$$
  Cl(\{-\}) \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow IrrClSub(X)

from the underlying set of $X$ to the set of [[irreducible closed subsets]] of $X$ (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible},

###### Proposition
**([[Hausdorff spaces are sober]])**

Every [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) is
a [[sober topological space]] (def. \ref{Sober}).

More specifically, in a Hausdorff topological space
the [[irreducible closed subspaces]] (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible})
are precisely the [[singleton]] [[subspaces]] (def. \ref{SubspaceTopology}).

Hence, by example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}, in particular
every [[metric space]] with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}) is sober.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The second statement clearly implies the first. To see the second
statement, suppose that $F$ is an irreducible closed subspace which
contained two distinct points $x \neq y$. Then by the Hausdorff property
there would be disjoint neighbourhoods $U_x, U_y$, and hence it would follow that
the relative [[complements]] $F \setminus U_x$ and $F \setminus U_y$ were distinct closed proper subsets of
$F$ with

$$
  F = (F \setminus U_x) \cup (F \setminus U_y)
$$

in contradiction to the assumption that $F$ is irreducible.

This [[proof by contradiction|proves by contradiction]] that every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.
Conversely, generally the [[topological closure]] of every singleton is irreducible closed, by example \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}.

=--

By prop. \ref{T0FromSober} and prop. \ref{SoberFromHausdorff} we have the implications on the right of the following diagram:

| [[separation axioms]]                 |
|---------------------------------------|
| $\array{\\ &&& T_2 = \text{Hausdorff}  \\ && \swArrow && \seArrow \\ \, & T_1 && && \text{sober} & \, \\ && \seArrow && \swArrow \\ &&& T_0 = \text{Kolmogorov} \\ }  $ |

But there there is no implication betwee $T_1$ and sobriety:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Proposition

The [[intersection]] of the [[classes]] of [[sober topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Sober}) and $T_1$-topological spaces (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) is not [[empty set|empty]], but neither class is contained within the other.

=--

That the intersection is not empty follows from prop. \ref{SoberFromHausdorff}.
That neither class is contained in the other is shown by the following counter-examples:

+-- {: .num_example #T1AndSoberIncomparable}
###### Example
**($T_1$ neither implies nor is implied by sobriety)**

* The [[Sierpinski space]] (def. \ref{SierpinskiSpace}) is sober, but not $T_1$.

* The [[cofinite topology]] (example \ref{TopologyCofinite}) on a non-[[finite set]] is $T_1$ but not sober.

Finally, sobriety is indeed strictly weaker that Hausdorffness:

1. in general not [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}).

### Frames of opens


What makes the concept of [[sober topological spaces]] special is that
for them the concept of [[continuous functions]] may be expressed entirely in terms
of the relations between their [[open subsets]], disregarding the underlying
set of points of which these opens are in fact subsets.

Recall from example \ref{ContinuousFunctionGivesFrameHomomorphism}
that for every [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$
the [[pre-image]] function $f^{-1} \colon \tau_Y \to \tau_X$ is a [[frame]] [[homomorphism]]
(def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}).

For sober topological spaces the converse holds:

+-- {: .num_prop #FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
###### Proposition

If $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ are [[sober topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Sober}), then
for every [[frame]] [[homomorphism]] (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens})

$$
  \tau_X \longleftarrow \tau_Y \;\colon\; \phi
$$

there is a unique [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ such that $\phi$ is the function
of forming [[pre-images]] under $f$:

$$
  \phi = f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof #ProofOfFrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
###### Proof

We first consider the special case of frame homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X \;\colon\; \phi
$$

and show that these are in bijection to the underlying set $X$, identified with the continuous functions
$\ast \to (X,\tau)$ via example \ref{PointsViaContinuousFunctions}.

By prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub}, the frame homomorphisms $\phi \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$
are identified with the irreducible closed subspaces $X \setminus U_\emptyset(\phi)$ of $(X,\tau_X)$.
Therefore by assumption of [[sober topological space|sobriety]] of $(X,\tau)$ there is a unique point
$x \in X$ with $X \setminus U_{\emptyset} = Cl(\{x\})$. In particular this means that for $U_x$ an open
neighbourhood of $x$, then $U_x$ is not a subset of $U_\emptyset(\phi)$, and so it follows that $\phi(U_x) = \{1\}$.
In conclusion we have found a unique $x \in X$ such that

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  U \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      \{1\} & \vert \,\text{if}\, x \in U
      \\
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the [[inverse image]] function of the continuous function $\ast \to X$ which sends $1 \mapsto x$.

Hence this establishes the bijection between frame homomorphisms of the form $\tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X$
and continuous functions of the form $\ast \to (X,\tau)$.

With this it follows that a general frame homomorphism of the form $\tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y$
defines a function of sets $X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ by [[composition]]:

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X)
    &\mapsto&
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous analysis, an element $U_Y \in \tau_Y$ is sent to $\{1\}$ under this composite precisely if
the corresponding point $\ast \to X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is in $U_Y$, and similarly for
an element $U_X \in \tau_X$. It follows that $\phi(U_Y) \in \tau_X$ is precisely that subset of
points in $X$ which are sent by $f$ to elements of $U_Y$, hence that $\phi = f^{-1}$ is the [[pre-image]]
function of $f$. Since $\phi$ by definition sends open subsets of $Y$ to open subsets of $X$, it follows
that $f$ is indeed a continuous function. This proves the claim in generality.

+-- {: .num_remark #Locales}
###### Remark
**([[locales]])**

Proposition \ref{FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
is often stated as saying that sober topological spaces are [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the
"[[locales with enough points]]" ([Johnstone 82, II 1.](#Johnstone82)). Here "[[locale]]" refers to a concept akin to topological spaces where one considers
_just_ a "[[frame of open subsets]]" $\tau_X$, without requiring that its elements be actual [[subsets]] of some ambient set.
The natural notion of [[homomorphism]] between such generalized topological spaces are clearly the [[frame]] homomorphisms
$\tau_X \leftarrow \tau_Y$ from def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}.

From this perspective, prop. \ref{FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces} says that
sober topological spaces $(X, \tau_X)$ are entirely characterized by their [[frames of opens]] $\tau_X$ and just so happen to
"have enough points" such that these are actual open subsets of some ambient set, namely of $X$.

### Sober reflection

To see that $\widetilde{(-)}$ indeed preserves unions, observe that (e.g. [Johnstone 82, II 1.3 Lemma](#Johnstone82))

    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p \in \widetilde{ \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i }
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used that the frame homomorphism $p \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ preserves unions. Similarly for intersections, now with $I$ a [[finite set]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p \in \underset{i \in I}{\cap} \widetilde{U_i} \;
    & \Leftrightarrow
    \underset{i \in I}{\forall} p(U_i) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow \underset{i \in I}{\cap} p(U_i) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p\left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_i\right) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p \in \widetilde{ \underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_i }
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used that the frame homomorphism $p$ preserves finite intersections.

To see that $s_X$ is continuous, observe that $s_X^{-1}(\tilde U) = U$, by construction.

###### Lemma
**([[sober reflection]] detects $T_0$ and sobriety)**

For $(X, \tau_X)$ a [[topological space]],
the function $s_X \colon X \to S X$ from def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction} is

1. an [[injection]] precisely if $(X,\tau_X)$ is $T_0$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. a [[bijection]] precisely if $(X,\tau_Y)$ is [[sober topological space|sober]] (def. \ref{Sober}), in which  case $s_X$ is in fact a [[homeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} there is an identification $S X \simeq IrrClSub(X)$ and via this $s_X$ is identified with the map $x \mapsto Cl(\{x\})$.

Hence the second statement follows by definition, and the first statement by prop. \ref{T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints}.

That in the second case $s_X$ is in fact a homeomorphism follows from the definition of the opens $\tilde U$: they are identified with the opens $U$ in this case (...expand...).

For $(X,\tau)$ a [[topological space]], then the topological space $(S X, \tau_{S X})$ from def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined} is sober.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $S X \setminus \tilde U$ be an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(S X, \tau_{S X})$. We need to show that it is the [[topological closure]] of a unique element $\phi \in S X$.

Observe first that also $X \setminus U$ is irreducible.

To see this use prop. \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}, saying that irreducibility of $X \setminus U$ is equivalent to $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U \Rightarrow (U_1 \subset U) or (U_2 \subset U)$. But if $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U$ then also $\tilde U_1 \cap \tilde U_2 \subset \tilde U$ (as in the [proof](#ProofOfSoberificationConstructionWellDefined) of lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined}) and hence by assumption on $\tilde U$ it follows that $\tilde U_1 \subset \tilde U$ or $\tilde U_2 \subset \tilde U$. By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} this in turn implies $U_1 \subset U$ or $U_2 \subset U$.  In conclusion, this shows that also $X \setminus U$ is irreducible .

By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} this irreducible closed subspace corresponds to a point $p \in S X$. By that same lemma, this frame homomorphism $p \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ takes the value $\emptyset$ on all those opens which are inside $U$. This means that the [[topological closure]] of this point is just $S X \setminus \tilde U$.

This shows that there exists at least one point of which $X \setminus \tilde U$ is the topological closure. It remains to see that there is no other such point.

So let $p_1 \neq p_2 \in S X$ be two distinct points. This means that there exists $U \in \tau_X$ with $p_1(U) \neq p_2(U)$. Equivalently this says that $\tilde U$ contains one of the two points, but not the other. This means that $(S X, \tau_{S X})$ is [[separation axiom|T0]].
By prop. \ref{T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints} this is equivalent to there being no two points with the same topological closure.

###### Proposition
**(unique factorization through soberification)**

For $(X, \tau_X)$ any [[topological space]], for $(Y,\tau_Y^{sob})$ a sober topological space, and for $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ a [[continuous function]], then it factors uniquely through the [[soberification]] $s_X \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (S X, \tau_{S X})$ from def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined}

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\exists !}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the construction in def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, we find that the outer part of the following square [[commuting square|commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau^{sob}_Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{s_{S X}}}
    \\
    (S X, \tau_{S X})
     &\underset{S f}{\longrightarrow}&
    (S S X, \tau_{S S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

By lemma \ref{SoberificationIsIndeedSober} and lemma \ref{UnitIntoSXDetectsT0AndSobriety}, the right vertical morphism $s_{S X}$ is an isomorphism (a [[homeomorphism]]), hence has an [[inverse morphism]]. This defines the diagonal morphism, which is the desired factorization.

To see that this factorization is unique, consider two factorizations $\tilde f, \overline{f} \colon \colon (S X, \tau_{S X}) \to (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})$ and apply the soberification construction once more to the triangles

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{ \tilde f, \overline{f}}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \phantom{AAA}
    \mapsto
  \phantom{AAA}
  \array{
    (S X, \tau_{S X}) &\overset{S f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\simeq}\downarrow & \nearrow_{ \tilde f, \overline{f}}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

Here on the right we used again lemma \ref{UnitIntoSXDetectsT0AndSobriety} to find that the vertical morphism is an isomorphism, and that $\tilde f$ and $\overline{f}$ do not change under soberification, as they already map between sober spaces. But now that the left vertical morphism is an isomorphism, the commutativity of this triangle for both $\tilde f$ and $\overline{f}$ implies that $\tilde f = \overline{f}$.

## Universal constructions
 {#UniversalConstructions}

We have seen [above](#BasicConstructions) various construction principles for [[topological spaces]] [above](#BasicConstructions),
such as [[topological subspaces]] and [[topological quotient spaces]]. It turns out that
these constructions enjoy certain
"[[universal properties]]" which allow us to find [[continuous functions]] into or out of these
spaces, respectively (examples \ref{UniversalPropertyOfBinaryProductSpace}, example \ref{UniversalPropertyOfDisjointUnionSpace} and \ref{UniversalPropertyOfQuotientSpace} below).

Since this is useful for handling topological spaces (we secretly used the universal property of the
quotient space construction already in the proof of prop. \ref{HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}), we next consider,
in def. \ref{LimitingCone} below, more general
"[[universal constructions]]" of topological spaces, called _[[limits]]_ and _[[colimits]]_ of topological spaces
(and to be distinguished from limits _in_ topological spaces, in the sense of [[convergence]]
of [[sequences]] as in def. \ref{Convergence}).

Moreover, we have seen [above](#HausdorffReflections) that the [[quotient space]] construction in general does not
preserve the $T_n$-[[separation axiom|separation]] property or [[sober space|sobriety]] property
of topological spaces, while the [[topological subspace]] construction does. The same turns out
to be true for the more general "colimiting" and "limiting" universal constructions. But we have also seen
that we may universally "reflect" any topological space to becomes a $T_n$-space or sober space.
The remaining question then is whether this reflection breaks the desired universal property.
We discuss that this is not the case, that instead the universal construction in all topological spaces
followed by these reflections gives the correct universal constructions in $T_n$-separated and sober topological
spaces, respectively (remark \ref{CoLimitsInNiceTopologicalSpaces} below).

After these general considerations, we finally discuss a [list of examples](#UniversalConstructionsExamples) of universal constructions in topological spaces.

$\,$

To motivate the following generalizations, first observe the [[universal properties]]
enjoyed by the basic construction principles of topological spaces from [above](#BasicConstructions)

+-- {: .num_example #UniversalPropertyOfBinaryProductSpace}
###### Example
**([[universal property]] of binary [[product topological space]])

Let $X_1, X_2$ be [[topological spaces]]. Consider their [[product topological space]]
$X_1 \times X_2$ from example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}. By example \ref{ProjectionsAreOpenContinuousFunctions}
the two [[projections]] out of the product space are [[continuous functions]]

$$
  \array{
    X_1 &\overset{pr_1}{\longleftarrow}& X_1 \times X_2 &\overset{pr_2}{\longrightarrow}& X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Now let $Y$ be any other [[topological space]]. Then, by [[composition]], every [[continuous function]]
$Y \to X_1 \times X_2$ into the product space yields two continuous component functions $f_1$ and $f_2$:

$$
  \array{
    && Y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_1}}\swarrow & \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}}
    \\
    X_1 &\underset{pr_1}{\longleftarrow}& X_1 \times X_2 &\underset{pr_2}{\longrightarrow}& X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

But in fact these two components completely characterize the function into the product: There is a
([[natural bijection|natural]]) [[bijection]] between continuous functions into the product space
and pairs of continuous functions into the two factor spaces:

$$
  \array{
    &
    \left\{
       Y \longrightarrow X_1 \times X_2
    \right\}
    &\simeq&

        \array{
          Y \longrightarrow X_1,
          \\
          Y \longrightarrow X_2
        }
      \right)
    \right\}
    \\
    \text{i.e.:}
    &
    \\
    &
    Hom(Y, X_1 \times X_2)
      &\simeq&
    Hom(Y,X_1) \times Hom(Y, X_2)
  }
  \,.
$$


=--


+-- {: .num_example #UniversalPropertyOfDisjointUnionSpace}
###### Example
**([[universal property]] of [[disjoint union spaces]])**

Let $X_1, X_2$ be [[topological spaces]]. Consider their [[disjoint union space]]
$X_1 \sqcup X_2$ from example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}. By definition,
the two inclusions into the disjoint union space are clearly [[continuous functions]]

$$
  \array{
    X_1 &\overset{i_1}{\longrightarrow}& X_1 \sqcup X_2 &\overset{i_2}{\longleftarrow}& X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Now let $Y$ be any other [[topological space]]. Then by [[composition]] a [[continuous function]]
$X_1 \sqcup X_2 \longrightarrow Y$ out of the disjoint union space yields two continuous component functions $f_1$ and $f_2$:

$$
  \array{
    X_1 &\overset{i_1}{\longleftarrow}& X_1 \sqcup X_2 &\overset{i_2}{\longrightarrow}& X_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f_1}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{f_2}}
    \\
    && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

But in fact these two components completely characterize the function out of the disjoint union: There is a
([[natural bijection|natural]]) [[bijection]] between continuous functions out of disjoint union spaces
and pairs of continuous functions out of the two summand spaces:

$$
  \array{
    &
    \left\{
       X_1 \sqcup X_2 \longrightarrow Y
    \right\}
    &\simeq&

        \array{
          X_1 \longrightarrow Y,

          X_2 \longrightarrow Y
        }
      \right)
    \right\}
    \\

**([[universal property]] of [[quotient topological spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and let $\sim$ be an [[equivalence relation]] on its
underlying set. Then the corresponding [[quotient topological space]] $X/\sim$
together with the corresponding qutient [[continuous function]]
$p \colon X \to X/\sim$ has the following [[universal property]]:

Given $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ any [[continuous function]] out of $X$
with the property that it respects the given [[equivalence relation]], in that

$$
  (x_1 \sim x_2)
    \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
    f(x_1) = f(x_2)

then there is a unique [[continuous function]] $\tilde f \colon X/\sim \longrightarrow Y$
such that

$$
  f = \tilde f\circ p

    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\exists ! \tilde f}
    \\
    X/\sim
  }
  \,.
$$

(We already made use of this universal property in the construction of the
$T_n$-reflection in the proof of prop. \ref{HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}.)

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that there is a unique function $\tilde f$ as claimed on the level of
functions of the underlying sets:
In order for $f = \tilde f \circ p$ to hold, $\tilde f$ must send an equivalence class in $X/\sim$
to one of its members

$$
  \tilde f \;\colon\; [x] \mapsto x
$$

and that this is well defined and independent of the choice of representative $x$ is guaranteed by
the condition on $f$ above.

Hence it only remains to see that $\tilde f$ defined this way is continuous, hence that for
$U \subset Y$ an open subset, then its pre-image $\tilde f^{-1}(U) \subset X/\sim$ is open
in the quotient topology. By definition of the quotient topology (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}),
this is the case precisely if its further pre-image under $p$ is open in $X$. But by the
fact that $f = \tilde f \circ p$, this is the case by the continuity of $f$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p^{-1}
    \left(
       \tilde f^{-1}
       \left(
         U
       \right)
    \right)
    & =
    \left(
      \tilde f \circ p
    \right)^{-1}(U)
    \\
    & = f^{-1}(U)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

This kind of example we now generalize.

### Limits and colimits
 {#LimitsAndColimits}

We consider now the general definition of [[free diagrams]] of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Diagram} below),
their [[cones]] and [[co-cones]] (def. \ref{Cone}) as well as [[limit|limiting cones]] and [[colimit|colimiting cocones]] (def. \ref{LimitingCone} below).

Then we use these concepts to see generally (remark \ref{CoLimitsInNiceTopologicalSpaces} below)
why [[limits]] (such as [[product spaces]] and [[subspaces]])
of $T_{n \leq 2}$-spaces and of [[sober spaces]] are again $T_n$ or sober, respectively, and to see that the
correct [[colimits]] (such as [[disjoint union spaces]] and [[quotient spaces]]) of $T_n$- or sober spaces
are instead the _$T_n$-reflection_ (prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}) or sober reflection (prop. \ref{SoberReflection}), respectively, of these
colimit constructions performed in the context of unconstrained topological spaces.

The [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] "$\bot$" over the empty diagram is hence that
for every object $X$, there is a unique map of the form $\bot \to X$. Such an object $\bot$ is called an _[[initial object]]_.

$$

be a [[free diagram]] of the shape "[[pair of parallel morphisms]]" (example \ref{ParallelMorphisms}).

A [[limit]] over this diagram according to def. \ref{LimitingCone} is also called the _[[equalizer]]_ of the maps $f_1$ and $f_2$.
This is a set or topological space $eq(f_1,f_2)$ equipped with a map $eq(f_1,f_2) \overset{p_1}{\longrightarrow} X_1$,
so that $f_1 \circ p_1 = f_2 \circ p_1$ and such that if $Y \to X_1$ is any other map with this property

$$

then there is a unique factorization through the equalizer:

In example \ref{ConeIncarnationOfSolutionsToEquations} we have seen that a cone over
such a pair of parallel morphisms is a _[[solution]]_ to the equation $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$.

The equalizer above is the _space of all solutions_ of this equation.

Often the defining [[universal property]] of a limit/colimit construction is all that one
wants to know. But sometimes it is useful to have an explicit description of the limits/colimits,
not the least because this proves that these actually exist.
Here is the explicit description of the (co-)limiting cone over a diagram of sets:


+-- {: .num_prop #SetLimits}
###### Proposition
**([limits and colimits of sets](limits+and+colimits+by+example#limcoliminset))**

Let

$$
  \left\{ X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\longrightarrow} X_j \right\}_{i,j \in I, \alpha \in I_{i,j}}
$$

be a [[free diagram]] of sets  (def. \ref{Diagram}). Then

1. its [[limit|limit cone]] (def. \ref{LimitingCone}) is given by the following [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]]
   $\underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i$
   of all the [[sets]] $X_i$ appearing in the diagram

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i
     \,\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow}\,
     \underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i
   $$

   on those [[tuples]] of elements which match the [[graphs]] of the functions appearing in the diagram:

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i} X_i
     \;\simeq\;
     \left\{
       (x_i)_{i \in I}
       \,\vert\,
       \underset{ {i,j \in I} \atop { \alpha \in I_{i,j} } }{\forall}
       \left(
         f_{\alpha}(x_i) = x_j
       \right)
     \right\}
   $$

   and the projection functions are $p_i \colon (x_j)_{j \in I} \mapsto x_i$.

1. its [[colimit|colimiting co-cone]] (def. \ref{LimitingCone}) is given by the [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i$ of all the [[sets]] $X_i$ appearing in the diagram

   $$
     \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i
       \,\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\longrightarrow}\,
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i
   $$

   with respect to the [[equivalence relation]] which is generated from the [[graphs]] of the functions in the diagram:

   $$
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i
     \;\simeq\;
     \left(
       \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i
     \right)/
     \left(
       (x \sim x')
         \Leftrightarrow
       \left(
         \underset{ {i,j \in I} \atop { \alpha \in I_{i,j} } }{\exists}
         \left(
           f_\alpha(x) = x'
         \right)
       \right)
     \right)
   $$

   and the injection functions are the evident maps to [[equivalence classes]]:

   $$
     q_i \;\colon\; x_i \mapsto [x_i]
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We dicuss the proof of the first case. The second is directly analogous.

First observe that indeed, by construction, the projection maps $p_i$ as given do make a cone over the free diagram,
by the very nature of the relation that is imposed on the tuples:

$$
  \array{
     &&
     \left\{
       (x_k)_{k \in I}
       \,\vert\,
       \underset{ {i,j \in I} \atop { \alpha \in I_{i,j} } }{\forall}
       \left(
         f_{\alpha}(x_i) = x_j
       \right)
     \right\}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
    \\
    X_i && \underset{f_\alpha}{\longrightarrow} && X_j
  }
  \,.
$$

We need to show that this is universal, in that every other cone over the free diagram factors universally
through this one. First consider the case that the tip of a given cone is a singleton:

$$
  \array{
    && \ast
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{p'_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p'_j}}
    \\
    X_i
      && \underset{f_\alpha}{\longrightarrow} &&
    X_j
  }
  \phantom{AAAAA}
    =
  \phantom{AAAAA}
  \array{
    && \ast
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{const_{x'_i}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{const_{x'_j}}}
    \\
    X_i
      && \underset{f_\alpha}{\longrightarrow} &&
    X_j
  }
  \,.
$$

As shown on the right, the data in such a cone is equivantly: for each $i \in I$ an element $x'_i \in X_i$, such that for all $i, j \in I$ and $\alpha \in I_{i,j}$
then $f_\alpha(x'_i) = x'_j$. But this is precisely the relation used in the construction of the limit above and hence there
is a unique map

$$
  \ast
    \overset{(x'_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}
     \left\{
       (x_k)_{k \in I}
       \,\vert\,
       \underset{ {i,j \in I} \atop { \alpha \in I_{i,j} } }{\forall}
       \left(
         f_{\alpha}(x_i) = x_j
       \right)
     \right\}
$$

such that for all $i \in I $ we have

$$
  \array{
    \ast
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{p'_i}}
    \\
     \left\{
       (x_k)_{k \in I}
       \,\vert\,
       \underset{ {i,j \in I} \atop { \alpha \in I_{i,j} } }{\forall}
       \left(
         f_{\alpha}(x_i) = x_j
       \right)
     \right\}
     &\underset{p_i}{\longrightarrow}&
     X_i
  }
$$

namely that map is the one that picks the element $(x'_i)_{i \in I}$.

This shows that every cone with tip a singleton factors uniquely through the claimed limiting cone. But
then for a cone with tip an arbitrary set $Y$, this same argument applies to all the single elements of $Y$.

It will turn out below in prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop} that limits and colimits
of diagrams of topological spaces are computed by first applying prop. \ref{SetLimits} to the underlying diagram
of underlying sets, and then equipping the result with a topology as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn #InitialAndFinalTopologies}
###### Definition
**([[initial topology]] and [[final topology]])**

Let $\{(X_i, \tau_i)\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[set]] of [[topological spaces]], and let $S$ be a bare [[set]]. Then

* For

  $$
    \{S \overset{\phantom{AA}p_i\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} X_i \}_{i \in I}

  a set of [[functions]] out of $S$, the _[[initial topology]]_ $\tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the
  [[coarse topology|coarsest]] topology on $S$ (def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}) such that all $f_i \colon (S,\tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})) \longrightarrow X_i$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

  By lemma \ref{RecognizingTopologicalBasis} this is equivalently
  the topology whose open subsets are the unions of finite intersections of the preimages of the open subsets of the
  component spaces under the projection maps, hence the topology generated from the [[sub-base for a topology|sub-base]]
  $$
    \beta_{ini}(\{p_i\} )
      =
    \left\{
      p_i^{-1}(U_i)
      \;\vert\;
      i \in I,\, U_i \subset X_i \, \text{open}
    \right\}
    \,.
  $$


* For

  $$
    \{X_i \overset{\phantom{AA}f_i\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} S\}_{i \in I}
  $$

  a set of [[functions]] into $S$, the _[[final topology]]_ $\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the
  [[fine topology|finest]] topology on $S$ (def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}) such that all $q_i \colon X_i \longrightarrow (S,\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

  Hence a subset $U \subset S$ is open in the final topology precisely if
  for all $i \in I$ then the [[pre-image]] $q_i^{-1}(U) \subset X_i$ is open.

$$

be a [[free diagram]] of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Diagram}).

1. The [[limit]] over this free diagram (def. \ref{LimitingCone}) is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space

   1. whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit of the underlying sets according to prop. \ref{SetLimits};

   1. whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

   $$
     \array{
       && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{k \in I} X_k

=--

(e.g. [Bourbaki 71, section I.4](#Bourbaki71))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the first case, the second is directly analogous:

Consider any [[cone]] over the given free diagram:

$$
  \array{
    && (\tilde X,\tau_{\tilde X})
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{p'_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p'_j}}
    \\
    (X_i, \tau_i) && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && (X_j, \tau_j)
  }
$$

By the nature of the limiting cone of the underlying diagram of underlying sets,
which always exists by prop. \ref{SetLimits}, there is a unique function of underlying sets of the form

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \tilde X \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
$$

satisfying the required conditions $p_i \circ \phi = p'_i$.  Since this is already unique
on the underlying sets, it is sufficient to
show that this function is always [[continuous function|continuous]] with respect to the
[[initial topology]].

Hence let $U \subset \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i$ be in $\tau_{initial}( \{p_i\} )$.
By def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, this means that $U$ is a union of finite intersections
of subsets of the form $p_i^{-1}(U_i)$ with $U_i \subset X_i$ open. But since taking pre-images
preserves unions and intersections (prop. \ref{PreservedByPreImages}),
and since unions and intersections of opens in $(\tilde X, \tau_{\tilde X})$
are again open, it is sufficient to consider $U$ of the form $U = p_i^{-1}(U_i)$. But then
by the condition that $p_i \circ \phi = p'_i$ we find

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi^{-1}\left(
      p_i^{-1}\left(
        U_i
      \right)
    \right)
    & =
    \left(
       p_i \circ \phi
    \right)^{-1}(U_i)
    \\
    & =
    (p'_i)^{-1}\left( U_i \right)
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

and this is open by the assumption that $p'_i$ is continuous.

We discuss a list of examples of (co-)limits of topological spaces in a moment [below](#UniversalConstructionsExamples),
but first we conclude with the main theoretical impact of the concept of topological (co-)limits for our our purposes.

Here is a key property of (co-)limits:

+-- {: .num_prop #HomFunctorPreservesLimits}
###### Proposition
**([[hom-functor preserves limits|functions into a limit cone are the limit of the functions into the diagram]])**

Let $\{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\longrightarrow} X_j\}_{i,j \in I, \alpha \in I_{i,j}}$
be a [[free diagram]] (def. \ref{Diagram}) of sets or of topological spaces.

1. If the [[limit]] $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i \in \mathcal{C}$ exists (def. \ref{LimitingCone}), then
   the [[set]] of (continuous) function into this limiting object is the limit over the sets $Hom(-,-)$ of (continuous) functions
   ("[[homomorphisms]]") into the components $X_i$:

   $$
     Hom\left(\,Y\,, \,\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i \, \right)
      \;\simeq\;
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i \left( Hom\left(\,Y\,, \,X_i\, \right) \right)
     \,.
   $$

   Here on the right we have the limit over the free diagram of sets given by the operations $f_\alpha \circ (-)$
   of post-composition with the maps in the original diagram:

   $$
     \left\{
       Hom(Y,X_i)
          \overset{\phantom{A} f_\alpha \circ (-) \phantom{A} }{\longrightarrow}
       Hom(Y, X_j)
     \right\}_{i,j \in I, \alpha \in I_{i,j}}
     \,.
   $$


1. If the [[colimit]] $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i \in \mathcal{C}$ exists, then
   the [[set]] of (continuous) functions out of this colimiting object is the limit over the sets of
   morphisms out of the components of $X_i$:

   $$
     Hom\left(\,\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i\,,\, Y\,\right)
       \;\simeq\;
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim} \left( Hom\left(\, X_i\,, \,Y\, \right) \right)
     \,.
   $$

   Here on the right we have the colimit over the free diagram of sets given by the operations
   $(-) \circ f_\alpha$ of pre-composition with the original maps:

   $$
     \left\{
       Hom(X_i, Y)
         \overset{\phantom{A} (-)\circ f_\alpha \phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
       Hom(X_j, Y)
     \right\}_{i,j \in I, \alpha \in I_{i,j}}
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We give the proof of the first statement. The proof of the second statement is directly analogous
(just reverse the direction of all maps).

First observe that, by the very definition of limiting cones, maps out of some $Y$ into them are in natural bijection
with the set $Cones\left(Y, \{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\} \right)$ of cones over the corresponding diagram with tip $Y$:

$$
  Hom\left(
    Y,
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i} X_i
  \right)
    \;\simeq\;
  Cones\left(
    Y, \{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Hence it remains to show that there is also a natural bijection like so:

$$
  Cones\left(
    Y,
    \{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\}
  \right)
    \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i} \left( Hom(Y,X_i) \right)
  \,.
$$

Now, again by the very definition of limiting cones, a single element in the limit on the right is equivalently a cone of the form

$$
  \left\{
  \array{
    && \ast
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{const_{p_i}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{const_{p_j}}}
    \\
    Hom(Y,X_i)
     && \underset{f_\alpha \circ (-)}{\longrightarrow} &&
    Hom(Y,X_j)
  }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This is equivalently for each $i \in I$ a choice of map $p_i \colon Y \to X_i$ , such that  for each $i,j \in I$
and $\alpha \in I_{i,j}$ we have $f_\alpha \circ p_i = p_j$. And indeed, this is precisely the characterization of an element in the
set $  Cones\left( Y, \{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\} \right)$.


=--

Using this, we find the following:

+-- {: .num_remark #CoLimitsInNiceTopologicalSpaces}
###### Remark
**(limits and colimits in categories of [[nice topological spaces]])**

Recall from remark \ref{ReflectiveSubcategory} the concept of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{\phantom{A}R\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{\phantom{A}L\phantom{A}}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  \mathcal{D}
$$

witnessed by [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{D}}\left( L(c),d \right)
    \simeq
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}\left( c,R(d) \right)
  \,.
$$

Then these _[[adjoints preserve (co-)limits]]_ in that

1. the [[left adjoint functor]] $L$ preserve [[colimits]] (def. \ref{LimitingCone})

   in that for every [[diagram]] $\{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\}$ in $\mathcal{D}$ there
   is a [[natural isomorphism]] of the form

   $$
     L \left(
       \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i
     \right)
     \;\simeq\;
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i L(X_i)
   $$

1. the [[right adjoint functor]] $R$ preserve [[limits]] (def. \ref{LimitingCone})

   in that for every [[diagram]] $\{X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ there
   is a [[natural isomorphism]] of the form

   $$
     R
     \left(
       \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i
     \right)
     \;\simeq\;
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i R(X_i)
     \,.
   $$


This implies that if we have a [[reflective subcategory]] of topological spaces

$$
  Top_{nice}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{\phantom{AA}\iota\phantom{AA}}{\hookrightarrow}}
      {\overset{\phantom{AA}L\phantom{AA}}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  Top
$$

(such as with $T_{n \leq 2}$-spaces according to remark \ref{ReflectiveSubcategory} or with sober spaces
according to remark \ref{SobertopologicalSpacesFormReflectiveSubcategory})

then

1. limits in $Top_{nice}$ are computed as limits in $Top$;

1. colimits in $Top_{nice}$ are computed as the reflection $L$ of the colimit in $Top$.

For example let $\{(X_i, \tau_i) \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} (X_j, \tau_j) \}$ be a diagram of Hausdorff spaces, regarded
as a diagram of general topological spaces. Then

1. not only is the limit of topological spaces $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i (X_i, \tau_i)$ according to prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop} again a Hausdorff space, but it also satisfies its universal property with
respect to the category of Hausdorff spaces;

1. not only is the reflection $T_2 \left( \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_i X_i \right)$
of the colimit as topological spaces a Hausdorff space
(while the colimit as topological spaces in general is not), but this reflection does satisfy the
universal property of a colimit with respect to the category of Hausdorff spaces.



=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that right/left adjoint functors preserve limits/colimits:
We discuss the case of the right adjoint functor preserving limits. The other case is
directly anlogous (just reverse the direction of all arrows).

So let  $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i$
be the limit over some diagram $\left\{ X_i \overset{f_\alpha}{\to} X_j\right\}_{i,j \in I, \alpha \in I_{i,j}}$.
To test what a right adjoint functor does to this, we may map any object $Y$ into it. Using prop. \ref{HomFunctorPreservesLimits} this yields

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom(Y, R(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i))
    & \simeq
    Hom(L(Y), \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i Hom(L(Y), X_i)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i Hom(Y, R(X_i))
    \\
    & \simeq Hom(Y, \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_i R(Y_i))
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

Since this is true for all $Y$, it [[Yoneda lemma|follows]] that

$$
  R(\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_i X_i)
  \simeq
  \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_i R(X_i)
  \,.
$$

Now to see that limits/colimits in the reflective subcategory are computed as claimed;

+-- {: .num_example #PointTopologicalSpaceAsEmptyLimit}
###### Example
**([[empty space]] and [[point space]] as empty [[colimit]] and [[limit]])**

Consider the [[empty diagram]] (example \ref{DiscreteDiagram}) as a diagram of [[topological spaces]].
By example \ref{TerminalInitialObject} the limit and colimit (def. \ref{LimitingCone}) over this type of diagram are the
_[[terminal object]]_ and _[[initial object]]_, respectively. Applied to topological spaces we find:

1. The [[limit]] of topological spaces over the [[empty diagram]] is the [[point space]] $\ast$ (example \ref{Point}).

1. The [[colimit]] of topological spaces over the [[empty diagram]] is the [[empty topological space]] $\emptyset$ (example \ref{Point}).

This is because for an empty diagram, the a (co-)cone is just a topological space, without any further data or properties,
and it is universal precisely if there is a unique continuous function to (respectively from) this space to any other space $X$.
This is the case for the point space (respectively empty space) by example \ref{TerminalityOfThePoint}:

$$
  \emptyset
    \overset{ \phantom{AA} \exists ! \phantom{AA} }{\longrightarrow}
  (X, \tau)

Consider a [[discrete category|discrete]] [[diagram]] consisting of two topological spaces $(X,\tau_X), (Y,\tau_Y)$ (example \ref{DiscreteDiagram}). Generally, it [[limit]] and [[colimit]] is the _[[product]]_ $X \times Y$ and _[[coproduct]]_ $X \sqcup Y$, respectively
(example \ref{CoProduct}).

1. In topological space this [[product]] is the binary [[product topological space]] from example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}, by the universal property observed in example \ref{UniversalPropertyOfBinaryProductSpace}:

   $$
     (X,\tau_X) \times (Y, \tau_Y) \simeq (X \times Y, \tau_{X \times Y})
     \,.
   $$


1. In topological spaces, this [[coproduct]] is the [[disjoint union space]] from example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces},
by the universal property observed in example \ref{UniversalPropertyOfDisjointUnionSpace}:

   $$
     (X, \tau_X) \sqcup (Y, \tau_Y) \simeq ( X \sqcup Y, \tau_{X \sqcup Y} )
     \,.
   $$

=--

So far these examples just reproduces simple constructions which we already considered.
Now the first important application of the general concept of limits of diagrams of topological spaces
is the following example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace} of product spaces with an
non-[[finite set]] of factors. It turns out that the correct topology on the underlying infinite [[Cartesian product]]
of sets is _not_ the naive generalization of the binary product topology, but instead is the corresponding
[[weak topology]], which in this case is called the _[[Tychonoff topology]]_:

+-- {: .num_example #InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}
###### Example
**(general [[product topological spaces]] with [[Tychonoff topology]])**

Consider an arbitrary [[discrete category|discrete]] [[diagram]] of topological spaces (def. \ref{DiscreteDiagram}),
hence a [[set]] $\{(X_i, \tau_i)\}_{i \in I}$ of topological spaces, indexed by any [[set]] $I$, not necessarily a [[finite set]].

The [[limit]] over this diagram (a _[[Cartesian product]]_, example \ref{CoProduct})
is called the _[[product topological space]]_ of the spaces in the diagram, and denoted

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\prod} (X_i, \tau_i)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{SetLimits} and prop. \ref{TopologicalSubspaceInitial}, the underlying set of this product space is
just the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets, hence the set of [[tuples]] $(x_i \in X_i)_{i \in I}$. This comes
for each $i \in I$ with the [[projection]] map

$$
  \array{
    \underset{j \in I}{\prod} X_j &\overset{pr_i}{\longrightarrow}& X_i
    \\
    (x_j)_{j \in I} & \overset{\phantom{AA}  \phantom{AA} }{\mapsto} & x_i
  }
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{TopologicalSubspaceInitial} and def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, the topology on this set
is the [[coarse topology|coarsest]] topology such that the [[pre-images]] $pr_i(U)$ of open subsets $U \subset X_i$
under these projection maps are open. Now one such pre-image is a [[Cartesian product]] of open subsets of the form

$$
  p_i^{-1}(U_i)
    \;=\;
  U_i
  \times
  \left(
    \underset{j \in I \setminus \{i\}}{\prod} X_j
  \right)
  \; \subset \;
  \underset{j \in I}{\prod} X_j
  \,.
$$


The [[coarse topology|coarsest topology]] that contains these open subsets ist that generated by these subsets regarded as
a [[topological base|sub-basis for the topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}), hence the arbitrary unions of finite intersections of
subsets of the above form.

Observe that a binary intersection of these generating open is (for $i \neq j$):

$$
  p_i^{-1}(U_i)
    \cap
  p_j^{-1}(U_j)
    \;\simeq\;
  U_i \times U_j
  \times
  \left(
    \underset{k \in I \setminus \{i.j\}}{\prod} X_k
  \right)
$$

and generally for a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ then

$$
  \underset{j \in J \subset I}{\cap} p_i^{-1}(U_i)
  \;=\;
  \left(
    \underset{j \in J \subset I}{\prod} U_j
  \right)
  \times
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I\setminus J}{\prod} X_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Therefore the open subsets of the product topology are unions of those of this form.
Hence the product topology is equivalently that generated by these subsets when regarded as a [[basis for the topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}).

This is also known as the _[[Tychonoff topology]]_.

Notice the subtlety: Naively we could have considered as open subsets the unions of products
$\underset{i \in I}{\prod}U_i$ of open
subsets of the factors, without the constraint that only finitely many of them differ from the corresponding total space.
This also defines a topology, called the _[[box topology]]_. For a [[finite set|finite index set]] $I$
the box topology coincides with the product space (Tychinoff) topology, but for non-finite $I$ it is strictly
[[fine topology|finer]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}).

###### Example

Write $Disc(\{0,1\})$ for the the [[discrete topological space]] with two points (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}). Write $\underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} Disc(\{0,2\})$ for the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}) of a [[countable set]] of copies of this discrete space with itself (i.e. the corresponding [[Cartesian product]] of sets $\underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} \{0,1\}$ equipped with the [[Tychonoff topology]] induced from the [[discrete topology]] of $\{0,1\}$).

Notice that due to  the nature of the [[Tychonoff topology]], this product space is _not_ itself discrete.

Consider the [[function]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod}
      &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}&
    [0,1]

    &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\mapsto}&
    \underoverset{i = 0}{\infty}{\sum} \frac{2 a_i}{ 3^{i+1}}
  }
$$

which sends an element in the product space, hence a [[sequence]] of binary digits, to the value of the [[power series]] as shown on the right.

One checks that this is a [[continuous function]] (from the [[product topology]] to the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] on the [[closed interval]]). Moreover with its [[image]] $\kappa\left( \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} \{0,1\}\right) \subset [0,1]$ equipped with its [[subspace topology]], then this is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image:

$$
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} Disc(\{0,1\})
    \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  \kappa\left(
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} Disc(\{0,1\})
  \right)

###### Example
**([[union]] of two [[open subset|open]] or two [[closed subset|closed]] [[subspaces]] is [[pushout]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $A,B \subset X$ be [[subspaces]] such that

1. $A,B \subset X$ are both [[open subsets]] or are both [[closed subsets]];

1. they constitute a [[cover]]: $X = A \cup B$

Write $i_A \colon A \to X$ and $i_B \colon B \to X$ for the corresponding inclusion [[continuous functions]].

Then the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
     A \cap B &\longrightarrow& A
     \\
     \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_A}}
     \\
     B &\underset{i_B}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

is a [[pushout]] square in [[Top]]  (example \ref{Pushout}).

By the [[universal property]] of the [[pushout]] this means in particular that for $Y$ any [[topological space]] then a function of underlying sets

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is a [[continuous function]] as soon as its two restrictions

$$
  f\vert_A \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow Y
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f\vert_A \;\colon\; B \longrightarrow Y
$$

are continuous.

More generally if $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is a [[cover]] of $X$ by an arbitrary set of [[open subsets]]
or by a [[finite set]] of [[closed subsets]], then a function $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous precisely
if all its restrictions $f\vert_{U_i}$ for $i \in I$ are continuous.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{SetLimits} the underlying diagram of underlying [[sets]] is clearly a pushout in [[Set]]. Therefore,
by prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop}, we need to show that the [[topological space|topology]] on $X$
is the [[final topology]] (def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}) induced by the set of functions $\{i_A, i_B\}$, hence that
a [[subset]] $S \subset X$ is an [[open subset]] precisely if the [[pre-images]] (restrictions)

$$
  i_A^{-1}(S) = S \cap A
   \phantom{AAA}
    \text{and}
   \phantom{AAA}
  i_B^{-1}(S) = S \cap B
$$

are open subsets of $A$ and $B$, respectively.

Now by definition of the [[subspace topology]], if $S \subset X$ is open, then the intersections $A \cap S \subset A$ and $B \cap S \subset B$ are open in these subspaces.

Conversely, assume that $A \cap S \subset A$ and $B \cap S \subset B$ are open. We need to show that then $S \subset X$ is open.

Consider now first the case that $A;B \subset X$ are both open open. Then by the nature of the [[subspace topology]], that $A \cap S$ is open in $A$ means that there is an open subset $S_A \subset X$ such that $A \cap S = A \cap S_A$. Since the intersection of two open subsets is open, this implies that $A \cap S_A$ and hence $A \cap S$ is open.  Similarly $B \cap S$. Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S
     & =
    S \cap X
    \\
    & = S \cap (A \cup B)
    \\
    & =  (S \cap A) \cup (S \cap B)
  \end{aligned}
$$

is the union of two open subsets and therefore open.

Now consider the case that $A,B \subset X$ are both closed subsets.

Again by the nature of the subspace topology, that $A \cap S \subset A$ and $B \cap S \subset B$ are open means that there exist open subsets $S_A, S_B \subset X$ such that $A \cap S = A \cap S_A$ and $B \cap S = B \cap S_B$. Since $A,B \subset X$ are closed by assumption, this means that $A \setminus S, B \setminus S \subset X$ are still closed, hence that $X \setminus (A \setminus S), X \setminus (B \setminus S) \subset X$ are open.

Now observe that (by [[de Morgan duality]])

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S
      & = X \setminus (X \setminus S)
    \\
      & =
    X \setminus ( (A \cup B) \setminus S )
    \\
      & =
    X \setminus ( (A \setminus S) \cup (B \setminus S) )
    \\
     & =
    (X \setminus (A \setminus S)) \cap (X \setminus (B \setminus S))
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

This exhibits $S$ as the intersection of two open subsets, hence as open.

Consider on the [[disjoint union]] set $X \sqcup Y$ the [[equivalence relation]] generated by the [[relation]]

$$
  (x \sim y) \Leftrightarrow \left( \underset{a \in A}{\exists}\left(  x = f(a) \,\text{and}\, y = g(a) \right)   \right)

Then prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop} implies that the pushout is equivalently the
[[quotient topological space]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) by this equivalence relation of the
[[disjoint union space]] (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}) of $X$ and $Y$:

+-- {: .num_defn #SingleCellAttachment}
###### Definition
**(single cell [[space attachment|attachment]])**

For $X$ any [[topological space]] and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then an _$n$-cell [[attaching space|attachment]]_ to $X$ is the result of gluing an [[n-disk]] to $X$, along a prescribed image of its bounding [[n-sphere|(n-1)-sphere]] (def. \ref{SpheresAndDisks}):

Let

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \longrightarrow X
$$

be a [[continuous function]], then the [[space attachment]] (example \ref{PushoutInTop})

$$
  X \cup_\phi D^n \,\in Top
$$

is the topological space which is the [[pushout]] of the boundary inclusion of the $n$-sphere along $\phi$, hence the universal space that makes the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow &(po)& \downarrow

###### Example
**([[discrete topological spaces]] from 0-cell [[space attachment|attachment]] to the [[empty space]])**

A single cell [[attaching space|attachment]] of a 0-cell, according to example \ref{SingleCellAttachment} is the same as forming the [[disjoint union space]] $X \sqcup \ast$ with the [[point space]] $\ast$:

$$
  \array{
     (S^{-1} = \emptyset) &\overset{\exists !}{\longrightarrow}&  X
     \\
     \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
     \\
     (D^0 = \ast) &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

In particular if we start with the [[empty topological space]] $X = \emptyset$ itself (example \ref{Point}), then by [[attaching space|attaching]] 0-cells we obtain a [[discrete topological space]]. To this then we may attach higher dimensional cells.

+-- {: .num_defn #CellAttachments}
###### Definition
**([[space attachment|attaching]] many cells at once)**


If we have a [[set]] of [[attaching maps]] $\{S^{n_i-1} \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} X\}_{i \in I}$ (as in def. \ref{SingleCellAttachment}), all to the same space $X$, we may think of these as one single continuous function out of the [[disjoint union space]] of their [[domain]] spheres

$$
  (\phi_i)_{i \in I}
    \;\colon\;
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup}
  S^{n_i-1}
   \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

Then the result of attaching _all_ the corresponding $n$-cells to $X$ is the pushout of the corresponding [[disjoint union]] of boundary inclusions:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} S^{n_i - 1}

+-- {: .num_defn #RelativeCellComplexes}
###### Definition
**([[relative cell complexes]] and [[CW-complexes]])


Let $X$ be a topological space, then
A _topological [[relative cell complex]]_ of countable height based on $X$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \colon X \longrightarrow Y
$$

and a [[sequential diagram]] of [[topological space]] of the form

$$
  X = X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow X_2 \hookrightarrow X_3 \hookrightarrow \cdots
$$

such that

1. each $X_k \hookrightarrow X_{k+1}$ is exhibited as a cell attachment according to def. \ref{CellAttachments}, hence presented by a [[pushout]] diagram of the form

   $$
     \array{
       \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} S^{n_i - 1}
         &\overset{(\phi_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}&
       X_k
       \\
       \downarrow
         &(po)&
       \downarrow
       \\
       \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{n_i}
         &\longrightarrow&
      X_{k+1}
     }
     \,.
   $$

1. $Y = \underset{k\in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} X_k$ is the [[union]] of all these cell attachments, and $f \colon X \to Y$ is the canonical inclusion; or stated more abstractly: the map $f \colon X \to Y$ is the inclusion of the first component of the diagram into its [[colimit|colimiting cocone]] $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k X_k$:

   $$
     \array{
       X = X_0 &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\longrightarrow& \cdots
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow && \cdots
       \\
       && Y = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet
     }
   $$

If here $X = \emptyset$ is the [[empty space]] then the result is a map $\emptyset \hookrightarrow Y$, which is equivalently just a space $Y$ built form "attaching cells to nothing". This is then called just a _topological [[cell complex]]_ of countable hight.

Finally, a topological (relative) cell complex of countable hight is called a **CW-complex** is the $(k+1)$-st cell attachment $X_k \to X_{k+1}$ is entirely by $(k+1)$-cells, hence exhibited specifically by a pushout of the following form:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} S^{k}
      &\overset{(\phi_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}&
    X_k
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(po)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{k+1}
      &\longrightarrow&
    X_{k+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Given a CW-complex, then $X_n$ is also called its $n$-[[skeleton]].

A _[[finite CW-complex]]_ is one which admits a presentation in which there are only finitely many attaching maps, and similarly a _countable CW-complex_ is one which admits a presentation with countably many attaching maps.

## Subspaces

We discuss special classes of [[subspaces]] of [[topological spaces]] that play an important role in the

1. _[Embeddings](#Embeddings)_


### Connected components
 {#ConnectedComponents}

Via [[homeomorphism]] to [[disjoint union spaces]] one may characterize whether topological spaces are
_[[connected topological spaces|connected]]_  (def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace} below),
and one may decompose every topological space
into its [[connected components]] (def. \ref{ComponentsConnected} below).

The important subtlety in to beware of
is that a topological space is _not_ in general the disjoint union space of its connected
components.
The extreme case of this phenomenon are [[totally disconnected topological spaces]]
(def. \ref{TotallyDisconnectedTopologicalSpace} below) which are nevertheless not [[discrete topological spaces|discrete]]
(examples \ref{RationalNumbersAreTotallyDisconnected} and \ref{TotallyDisconnectedCantorSpace} below).
Spaces which are free from this exotic behaviour include the
_[[locally connected topological spaces]]_ (def.  \ref{LocallyConnected} below)
and in particular
the [[locally path-connected topological spaces]] (def. \ref{ForLocallyPathConnectedThenPathConnectedComponentsAgree} below).

1. For all pairs of topological spaces $(X_1, \tau_1), (X_2, \tau_2)$
such that $(X, \tau)$ is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism})
to their [[disjoint union space]] (def. \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces})

   $$
     (X,\tau) \simeq (X_1,\tau_1) \sqcup (X_2,\tau_2)
   $$

   then exactly one of the two spaces is the [[empty space]] (example \ref{Point}).

1. For all pairs of [[open subsets]] $U_1, U_2 \subset X$ if

   $$
     U_1 \cup U_2 = X \phantom{A}\text{and} \phantom{A} U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset
   $$

   then exactly one of the two subsets is the [[empty set]];

1. if a [[subset]] $CO \subseteq X$ is both an [[open subset]] and a [[closed subset]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) then $ CO = X$ if and only if $CO$ is [[inhabited set|non-empty]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Lemma

The conditions in def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace} are indeed equivalent.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the equivalence of the first two statements:

Suppose that in every disjoint union decomposition of $(X,\tau)$ exactly one summand is empty. Now consider two disjoint open subsets $U_1, U_2 \subset X$ whose union is $X$ and whose intersection is empty. We need to show that exactly one of the two subsets is empty.

Write $(U_1, \tau_{1})$ and $(U_2, \tau_2)$ for the corresponding [[topological subspaces]].
Then observe that from the definition of [[subspace topology]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology})
and of the [[disjoint union space]] (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}) we have a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  X \simeq (U_1, \tau_1) \sqcup (U_2, \tau_2)
$$

because by assumption every open subset $U \subset X$ is the disjoint union of open subsets of $U_1$ and $U_2$, respectively:

$$
  U = U \cap X = U \cap (U_1 \sqcup U_2) = (U \cap U_1) \sqcup (U \cap U_2)
  \,,
$$

which is the definition of the disjoint union topology.

Hence by assumption exactly one of the two summand spaces is the [[empty space]] and hence the underlying set is the empty set.

Conversely, suppose that for every pair of open subsets $U_1, U_2 \subset U$ with $U_1 \cup U_2 = X$ and $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$ then exactly one of the two is empty. Now consider a homeomorphism of the form $(X,\tau) \simeq (X_1, \tau_1) \sqcup (X_2,\tau_2)$. By the nature of the [[disjoint union space]] this means that $X_1, X_2 \subset X$ are disjoint open subsets of $X$ which cover $X$.
So by assumption precisely one of the two subsets is the empty set and hence precisely one of the two topological spaces is the empty space.

Now regarding the equivalence to the third statement:

If a subset $CO \subset X$ is both closed and open, this means equivalently that it is open and that its [[complement]] $X \setminus CO$ is also open, hence equivalently that there are two open subsets $CO, X \backslash CO \subset X$ whose union is $X$ and whose intersection is empty. This way the third condition is equivalent to the second, hence also to the first.

###### Remark
**([[empty space]] is not [[connected topological space|connected]])**

According to def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace} the [[empty topological space]] $\emptyset$ (def. \ref{Point})
is _not_ connected, since $\emptyset \simeq \emptyset \sqcup \emptyset$, where both instead
of exactly one of the summands are empty.

Of course it is immediate to change def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace} so that it would
regard the empty space as connected. This is a matter of convention.

  \underset{ r \in \mathbb{R}  }{\forall}

      x \lt r \lt y

   \left(

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Suppose on the contrary that we had $x \lt r \lt y$ but $r \notin S$. Then by the
nature of the [[subspace topology]] there would be a decomposition of $S$ as a [[disjoint union]]
of [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[open subsets]]:

$$
  S

    S \cap (-\infty,r)

$$

But since $x \lt r$ and $r \lt y$ both these open subsets were [[inhabited set|non-empty]], thus contradicting the
assumption that $S$ is connected. This yields a [[proof by contradiction]].

We need to show that precisely one of them is the [[empty set]].

Since $p$ is a [[continuous function]], also the [[pre-images]] $p^{-1}(U_1), p^{-1}(U_2) \subset X$
are open subsets and are still disjoint. Since $p$ is [[surjective function|surjective]] it also follows that
$p^{-1}(U_1) \cup p^{-1}(U_2) = X$. Since $X$ is connected, it follows that one of these two pre-images is
the empty set. But again sicne $p$ is surjective, this implies that precisely one of $U_1, U_2$ is empty,
which means that $f(X)$ is connected.

###### Example
**([[product space]] of [[connected spaces]] is [[connected space|connected]])**

Let $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[connected topological spaces]] (def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace}).
Then also their [[product topological space]]  $\underset{i \in I}{\prod}X_i$
(example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}) is connected.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $U_1, U_2 \subset \underset{i \in I}{\prod}X_i$ be an [[open cover]]
of the product space by two disjoint open subsets. We need to show that precisely one of the two
is empty. Since each $X_i$ is connected and hence non-empty, the product space is not empty, and hence
it is sufficient to show that at least one of the two is empty.

Assume on the contrary that both $U_1$ and $U_2$ were non-empty.

Observe first that if so, then we could find $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$
whose coordinates differed only in a finite subset of $I$. This is since by the nature of the
[[Tychonoff topology]] $\pi_i(U_1) = X_i$ and $\pi_i(U_2) = X_i$ for all but a finite number of $i \in i$.

Next observe that we then could even find $x'_1 \in U_1$ that differed only in a single coordinate from $x_2$:
Because pick one coordinate in which $x_1$ differs from $x_2$ and change it to the corresponding coordinate of $x_2$.
Since $U_1$ and $U_2$ are a cover, the resulting point is either in $U_1$ or in $U_2$. If it is in $U_2$, then
$x_1$ already differed in only one coordinate from $x_2$ and we may take $x'_1 \coloneqq x_1$.
If instead the new point is in $U_1$, then rename it to $x_1$ and repeat the argument. By [[induction]]
this finally yields an $x'_1$ as claimed.

Therefore it is now sufficient to see that it leads to a contradiction to assume
that there are points $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$
that differ in only the $i_0$th coordinate, for some $i_0 \in I$, in that this would imply that $x_1 = x_2$.

Observe that the inclusion

$$
  \iota \colon X_{i_0} \longrightarrow \underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i
$$

which is the identity on the $i_0$th component and is otherwise constant on the $i$th component of
$x_1$ or equivalently of $x_2$ is a continuous function, by the nature of the [[Tychonoff topology]] (example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}).

Therefore also the restrictions $\iota^{-1}(U_1)$ and $\iota^{-1}(U_2)$ are open subsets.
Moreover they are still disjoint and cover $X_{i_0}$. Hence by the connectedness of $X_{i_0}$,
precisely one of them is empty. This means that the $i_0$-component of both $x_1$ and $x_2$
must be in the other subset of $X_i$, and hence that $x_1$ and $x_2$ must both be in $U_1$
or both in $U_2$, contrary to the assumption.

regards two points as equivalent if they both sit in some [[subset]]
which, as a [[topological subspace]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}), is [[connected topological space|connected]] (def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace}):

the set of [[connected components]] (def. \ref{ComponentsConnected}) of their

###### Proposition
**([[topological closure]] of [[connected topological space|connected]] [[subspace]] is [[connected topological space|connected]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and let $S \subset X$ be a [[subset]] which, as a [[subspace]], is [[connected topological space|connected]] (def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace}). Then also the [[topological closure]] $Cl(S) \subset X$ is connected

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Suppose that $Cl(S) = A \sqcup B$ with $A,B \subset X$ [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] [[open subsets]]. We need to show that one of the two is empty.

But also the intersections $A \cap S\,,B \cap S \subset S$ are disjoint subsets, open as subsets of the subspace $S$ with $S = (A \cap S) \sqcup (B \cap S)$. Hence by the connectedness of $S$, one of $A \cap S$ or $B \cap S$ is empty. Assume $B \cap S$ is empty, otherwise rename. Hence $A \cap S = S$, or equivalently: $S \subset A$. By disjointness of $A$ and $B$ this means that  $S \subset Cl(S) \setminus B$. But since $B$ is open, $Cl(S) \setminus B$ is still closed, so that

$$
  (S \subset Cl(S) \setminus B)
  \Rightarrow
  (Cl(S) \subset Cl(S) \setminus B)
  \,.
$$

This means that $B = \emptyset$, and hence that $Cl(S)$ is connected.

###### Proposition
**([[connected components]] are [[closed subset|closed]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Then its [[connected components]] (def. \ref{ComponentsConnected}) are [[closed subsets]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition, the connected components are [[maximal elements]] in the set of connected subspaces [[preorder|pre-ordered]] by inclusion.
Assume a connected component $U$ were not closed. By prop. \ref{ClosureOfConnectedSubspaceIsConnected}
its closure $Cl(U)$ is still closed, and would be strictly larger, contradicting the maximality of $U$.
This yields a [[proof by contradiction]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{ConnectedComponentsAreClosed} implies that when a space has a [[finite set]] of connected components, then they are not just closed but also open, hence [[clopen subsets]] (because then each is the [[complement]] of a finite union of closed subspaces).
This in turn means that the space is the [[disjoint union space]] of its connected components.

For a non-finite set of connected components this remains true if the space is [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]]
see def. \ref{LocallyConnected}, lemma \ref{AlternativeCharacterizationOfLocalConnectivity} below.

We now highlight the subtlety that not every topological space is the
disjoint union of its connected components. For this it is useful to consider
the following extreme situation:

+-- {: .num_defn #TotallyDisconnectedTopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**([[totally disconnected topological space]])**

A [[topological space]] is called _[[totally disconnected topological space|totally disconnected]]_
if all its
[[connected components]] (def. \ref{ComponentsConnected}) are [[singletons]], hence [[point spaces]] (example \ref{ConcreteAndAbstractPoint}).

=--

The trivial class of examples is this:

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**([[discrete topological spaces]] are [[totally disconnected topological space|totally disconnected]])**

Every [[discrete topological space]]
(example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) is a [[totally disconnected topological space]] (def. \ref{TotallyDisconnectedTopologicalSpace}).

=--

But the important point is that there are non-discrete totally disconnected topological spaces:

+-- {: .num_example #RationalNumbersAreTotallyDisconnected}
###### Example
**(the [[rational numbers]] are [[totally disconnected topological space|totally disconnected]] but non-[[discrete topological space]])**

The [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ equipped
with their [[subspace topology]] (def. \ref{SubspaceTopology})
inherited
from the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology}) on the [[real numbers]], form a [[totally disconnected space]] (def. \ref{TotallyDisconnectedTopologicalSpace}), but not a [[discrete topological space]]
(example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that the subspace topology is not discrete, since the [[singletons]] $\{q\} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ are not [[open subsets]]
(because their [[pre-image]] in $\mathbb{R}$ are still
singletons, and the points in a [[metric space]] are closed, by example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace} and prop. \ref{T1InTermsOfTopologicalClosure}).

What we need to see is that $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ is nevertheless totally disconnected:

By construction, a [[base for a topology|base for the topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}) is given by the open subsets which are restrictions of [[open intervals]] of real numbers to the rational numbers

$$
  (a,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} \coloneqq (a,b) \cap \mathbb{Q}
$$

for $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$.

Now for any such $a \lt b$ there exists an [[irrational number]] $r \in \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ with $a \lt r \lt b$. This being irrational implies that $(a,r)_{\mathbb{Q}} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ and $(r,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ are disjoint subsets. Therefore every basic open subset is the disjoint union of (at least) two open subsets:

$$
  (a,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} = (a,r)_{\mathbb{Q}} \cup (r,b)_{\mathbb{Q}}
  \,.
$$

Hence no [[inhabited set|non-empty]] open subspace of the rational numbers is connected.

+-- {: .num_example #TotallyDisconnectedCantorSpace}
###### Example
**([[Cantor space]] is [[totally disconnected topological space|totally disconnected]] but non-[[discrete topological space|discrete]])**

The [[Cantor space]] $\underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} Disc(\{0,1\})$ (example \ref{CantorSpace}) is a [[totally disconnected topological space]] (def. \ref{TotallyDisconnectedTopologicalSpace}) but is _not_ a [[discrete topological space]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[base of a topology|base opens]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase})
of the [[product topological space]] $\underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod} Disc(\{1,2\})$ (example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}) are of the form

$$
  \left( \underset{i \in I \subset \mathbb{N}}{\prod} U_i \right)
  \times
  \left(
    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}\setminus I}{\prod} \{1,2\}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

for $I \subset \mathbb{N}$ a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]].

First of all this is not the [[discrete topological space|discrete topology]], for that also contains
infinite products of proper subsets of $\{1,2\}$ as open subsets, hence is strictly [[finer topology|finer]].

On the other hand, since $I \subset \mathbb{N}$ is finite, $\mathbb{N}\setminus I$ is [[inhabited set|non-empty]]
and hence there exists some $k_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the corresponding factor in the above product is
the full set $\{1,2\}$. But then the above subset is the
disjoint union of the open subsets

$$
  \{1\}_{k_0}
  \times
  \left(
     \underset{i \in I \setminus \{k_0\} \subset \mathbb{N}}{\prod} U_i \right)
   \times
  \left(
    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}\setminus (I \cup \{k_0\}) }{\prod} \{1,2\}
  \right)
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \{2\}_{k_0}
  \times
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I \setminus \{k_0\} \subset \mathbb{N}}{\prod} U_i
  \right)
   \times
  \left(
    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}\setminus (I\setminus \k_0 ) }{\prod} \{1,2\}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

In particular if $x \neq y$ are two distinct points in the original open subset,
them being distinct means that there is a smallest $k_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
they have different coordinates in $\{1,2\}$ in that position. By the above this
implies that they belong to different connected components.

interested in topological spaces
which do not share the phenomenon of examples \ref{RationalNumbersAreTotallyDisconnected} or

which _are_ the disjoint union of their connected components:


+-- {: .num_example #LocallyConnected}
###### Definition
**([[locally connected topological spaces]])**

A [[topological space]]  $(X,\tau)$ is called _[[locally connected topological space|locally connected]]_
if the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. For every point $x$ and every [[neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ there is
   a [[connected topological space|connected]] (def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace})
   open neighbourhood $Cn_x \subset U_x$.

1. Every [[connected component]] of every open [[subspace]] of $X$ is open.

###### Lemma

The conditions in def. \ref{LocallyConnected} are indeed all equivalent.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

$\,$

1) $\Rightarrow$ 2)

Assume every neighbourhood of $X$ contains a connected neighbourhood
and let $U \subset X$ be an open subset with $U_0 \subset U$ a connected component. We need to show that $U_0$ is open.

Consider any point $x \in U_0$. Since then also $x \in U$, there is a connected open neighbourhood $U_{x,0}$ of $x$ in $X$. Observe that this must be contained in $U_0$, for if it were not then $U_0 \cup U_{x,0}$ were a larger open connected open neighbourhood, contradicting the maximality of the connected component $U_0$.

Hence $U_0 = \underset{x \in U_0}{\cup} U_{x,0}$ is a union of open  subsets, and hence itself open.

2) $\Rightarrow$ 3)

Now assume that every connected component of every open subset $U$ is open. Since the connected components generally constitute a [[cover]] of $X$ by [[disjoint subsets]], this means that now they form an [[open cover]] by disjoint subsets. But by forming intersections with the cover this implies that every open subset of $U$ is the disjoint union of open subsets of the connected components (and of course every union of open subsets of the connected components is still open in $U$), which is the definition of the topology on the [[disjoint union space]] of the connected components.

3) $\Rightarrow$ 1)

Finally assume that every open subspace is the disjoint union of its connected components. Let $x$ be a point and $U_x \supset \{x\}$ a neighbourhood. We need to show that $U_x$ contains a connected neighbourhood of $x$.

But, by definition, $U_x$ contains an open neighbourhood of $x$ and by assumption this decomposes as the disjoint union of its connected components. One of these contains $x$. Since in a [[disjoint union space]] all summands are open, this is the required connected open neighbourhod.

**([[Euclidean space]] is [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]])

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) (with its [[metric topology]],
example \ref{MetricTopology}) is [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]]
(def. \ref{LocallyConnected}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By nature of the Euclidean metric topology, every neighbourhood $U_x$ of a point $x$
contains an [[open ball]] containing $x$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}).
Moreover, every open ball clearly contains an open [[cube]],
hence a [[product space]] $\underset{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} (x_i-\epsilon, x_i + \epsilon)$ of [[open intervals]] which is still a neighbourhood of $x$ (example \ref{ClosedIntervalsProduct}).

Now intervals are connected by example \ref{ConnectedSubspacesOfRealLineAreTheIntervals}
and product spaces of connected spaces are connected
by example \ref{ProductSpaceOfConnectedSpacesIsConnected}.
This shows that ever open neighbourhood contains a connected neighbourhood, which is the
characterization of local connectedness in the first item of def. \ref{LocallyConnected}.

from the [[closed interval]] (example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) equipped with

Being connected by a [[path]] (def. \ref{Path}) is an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim_{pcon}$ on the underlying set of
points $X$.

###### Proof

We need to show that the relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]],
[[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]].

For $x \in X$ a point, then the [[constant function]] with value $x$

$$
  const_x \;\colon\; [0,1] \to \ast \overset{}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

is continuous (example \ref{PointsViaContinuousFunctions}). Therefore $x \sim_{pcon} x$  for all points ([[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]).

For $x,y \in X$ two points and

$$
  \gamma
    \;\colon\;
  [0,1] \longrightarrow X
$$

a path connecting them, then the _reverse path_

$$
  [0,1]
    \overset{(1-(-))}{\longrightarrow}
  [0,1]

$$

is continuous (the function $[0,1] \overset{1-(-)}{\to} [0,1]$ is continuous because
[[polynomials are continuous]] ). Hence with $x \sim_{pcon} y$ also $y \sim_{pcon} x$ ([[symmetric relation|symmetry]]).

For $x,y,z \in X$ three points and for

$$
  \gamma_1, \gamma_2
    \;\colon\;
  [0,1] \longrightarrow X
$$

two paths with $\gamma_1(0) = x$, $\gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(0) = y$ and $\gamma_2(1) = z$

$$
  \gamma_1(x) \overset{\pahntom{A}\gamma_1\phantom{A}}{\rightsquigarrow} \gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(0) \overset{ \phantom{A}\gamma_2\phantom{A} }{\rightsquigarrow} \gamma_2(1)
$$

consider the function

$$
  \array{
    [0,1] &\overset{  (\gamma_2 \cdot \gamma_1) }{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    t
    &\mapsto&

$$

This is a [[continuous function]] by example \ref{ClosedSubspacesGluing}, hence this constitutes a path connecting $x$ with $z$
(the "concatenated path"). Therefore $x \sim_{pcon} y$ and $y \sim_{pcon} z$ implies $x \sim_{pcon} z$ ([[transitive relation|transitivity]]).

there is a continuous function

$$
  \gamma \colon [0,1] \longrightarrow X

with $\gamma(0) = p^{-1}(x)$ and $\gamma(1) = p^{-1}(y)$. Since the composition of continuous

Assume it were not, then it would be covered by two disjoint non-empty open subsets $U_1, U_2 \subset X$. But by path connectedness there were a continuous path $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ from a point in one of the open subsets to a point in the other. The continuity would imply that $\gamma^{-1}(U_1), \gamma^{-1}(U_2) \subset [0,1]$ were a disjoint open cover of the interval. This would be in contradiction to the fact that intervals are connected. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called _[[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]]_
if for every point $x \in X$ and every [[neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ there exists
a neighbourhood $C_x \subset U_x$ which, as a [[subspace]],

Let $X$ be a [[locally path-connected topological space]] (def. \ref{PathConnectedLocally}).
Then each of its path-connected components is an [[open set]] and a [[closed set]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that every path connected component $P_x$ is open,
it is sufficient to show that every point $y \in P_x$ has an [[neighbourhood]] $U_y$ which is still contained in $P_x$. But by local path connectedness, $y$ has a neighbourhood $V_y$ which  is path connected. It follows by concatenation of paths
(as in the proof of lemma \ref{ConnectedByPathIsEquivalenceRelation}) that $V_y \subset P_x$.

Now each path-connected component $P_x$ is the [[complement]] of the [[union]] of all the
other path-connected components. Since these are all open, their union is open, and hence the
complement $P_x$ is closed.

###### Proposition
**(in a [[locally path-connected space]] [[connected components]] coincide with path-connected components)**

Let $X$ be a [[locally path-connected topological space]] (def. \ref{PathConnectedLocally}).
Then the [[connected components]] of $X$ according
to def. \ref{ComponentsConnected} agree
with the path-connected components according to def. \ref{PathConnectedComponents}.

In particular, locally path connected spaces are [[locally connected topological spaces]] (def. \ref{LocallyConnected}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A path connected component is always connected by lemma \ref{ConnectedPathConnectedSpace},
and in a locally path-connected space it is also open, by prop. \ref{InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen}.
This implies that the path-connected components are maximal connected subspaces, and hence must be the connected components.

Conversely let $U$ be a connected component. It is now sufficient to see that this is
path-connected. Suppose it were not, then it would be covered by
more than one disjoint non-empty path-connected components.
But by prop. \ref{InLocallyPathConnectedSpaceThePathConnectedComponentsAreOpen} these
would all be open. This would be in contradiction with the assumption that
$U$ is connected. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

**([[embedding of topological spaces]])**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[topological spaces]]. A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is called an _[[embedding of topological spaces]]_ if in its [[image factorization]] (example \ref{ImageFactorization})

$$

###### Proposition
**([[closed injections are embeddings|open/closed continuous injections are embeddings]])**

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y,\tau_Y)$
which is

1. an [[injective function]]

1. an [[open map]] or a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap})

is an [[embedding of topological spaces]] (def. \ref{EmbeddingOfTopologicalSpaces}).

This is called a _closed embedding_ if the [[image]] $f(X) \subset Y$ is a [[closed subset]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $f$ is injective, then the map onto its [[image]] $X \to f(X) \subset Y$ is a [[bijection]]. Moreover, it is still continuous with respect to the subspace topology on $f(X)$ (example \ref{ImageFactorization}). Now a bijective continuous function is a homeomorphism precisely if it is an [[open map]] or a [[closed map]] prop. \ref{HomeoContinuousOpenBijection} .

Let

1. $X$ be a [[topological space]]

1. $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space]]

1. $f \colon X \to Y$ be a [[continuous function]].

Then the following are equivalent

1. $f$ is an [[injective function|injective]] [[proper map]],

1. $f$ is a closed [[embedding of topological spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, if $f$ is an injective proper map,
then since [[proper maps to locally compact spaces are closed]], it follows that $f$ is also  [[closed map]]. The claim then follows since [[closed injections are embeddings]], and since the image of a closed map is closed.

Conversely, if $f$ is a closed embedding, we only need to show that the embedding map is proper. So for $C \subset Y$ a [[compact subspace]], we need to show that the [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(C) \subset X$ is also compact. But since $f$ is an injection (being an embedding), that pre-image is just the intersection $f^{-1}(C) \simeq C \cap f(X)$. By the nature of the [[subspace topology]], this is compact if $C$ is.

**([[compact topological space|compactness]] in terms of [[closed subsets]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $(X,\tau)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] in the sense of def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}.

1. Let $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[closed subsets]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) such that their [[intersection]]
   is [[empty set|empty]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i = \emptyset$, then there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]
   $J \subset I$ such that the corresponding finite intersection is still empty $\underset{i \in  J \subset i}{\cap} C_i = \emptyset$.

1. Let $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[closed subsets]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) such that it enjoys the
   _[[finite intersection property]]_, meaning that for every [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ then
   the corresponding finite intersection is [[inhabited set|non-empty]] $\underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$.
   Then also the total intersection is [[inhabited set|non-empty]], $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The equivalence between the first and the second statement is immediate from the definitions after expressing
open subsets as complements of closed subsets $U_i = X \setminus C_i$ and applying [[de Morgan's law]]
(prop. \ref{deMorgan}).

We discuss the equivalence between the first and the third statement:

In one direction, assume that $(X,\tau)$ is compact in the sense of def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}, and that $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ satisfies the [[finite intersection property]]. We need to show that then $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$.

Assume that this were not the case, hence assume that $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i = \emptyset$. This would imply that the open [[complements]] were an [[open cover]] of $X$ (def. \ref{OpenCover})

$$
  \left\{
     U_i \coloneqq X \setminus C_i
  \right\}_{i \in I}
  \,,
$$

because (using [[de Morgan's law]], prop. \ref{deMorgan})

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i\;
    & \coloneqq
    \underset{i \in I}{\cup} X \setminus C_i
    \\
    & = X \setminus \left( \underset{i \in I}{\cap}C_i \right)
    \\
    & = X \setminus \emptyset
    \\
    & = X
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

But then by compactness of $(X,\tau)$ there were a finite subset $J \subset I$ such that $\{ U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ were still an open cover, hence that $\underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} U_i = X $. Translating this back through the [[de Morgan's law]] again this would mean that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \emptyset
       & =
    X \setminus
    \left(
      \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} U_i
    \right)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    X \setminus
    \left(
      \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} X \setminus C_i
    \right)
    \\
    & = \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cap} X \setminus \left( X \setminus C_i\right)
    \\
    & =
    \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cap}  C_i
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

This would be in contradiction with the finite intersection property of $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$, and hence we have [[proof by contradiction]].

Conversely, assume that every set of closed subsets in $X$ with the finite intersection property has non-empty total intersection. We need to show that the every open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ has a finite subcover.

Write $C_i \coloneqq X \setminus U_i$ for the closed complements of these open subsets.

Assume on the contrary
that there were no finite subset $J \subset I$ such that $\underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} U_i = X$,
hence no finite subset such that
$\underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cap} C_i = \emptyset$. This would mean that $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I }$ satisfied the finite intersection property.

But by assumption this would imply that $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$, which, again by de Morgan, would mean that $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i \neq X$. But this contradicts the assumption that the $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ are a cover. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all the closed intervals are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (by example \ref{OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn})
it is sufficient to show the statement for $[0,1]$. Hence let $\{U_i \subset [0,1]\}_{i \in I}$ be an
[[open cover]] (def. \ref{OpenCover}). We need to show that it has an open subcover.

Say that an element $x \in [0,1]$ is _admissible_ if the closed sub-interval $[0,x]$ is covered by
finitely many of the $U_i$. In this terminology, what we need to show is that $1$ is admissible.

Observe from the definition that

1. 0 is admissible,

1. if $y \lt x \in [0,1]$ and $x$ is admissible, then also $y$ is admissible.

This means that the set of admissible $x$ forms either

1. an [[open interval]] $[0,g)$

1. or a [[closed interval]] $[0,g]$,

for some $g \in [0,1]$. We need to show that the latter is true, and for $g = 1$.
We do so by observing that the alternatives lead to contradictions:

1. Assume that the set of admissible values were an open interval $[0,g)$. Pick an $i_0 \in I$ such that $g \in U_{i_0}$ (this exists because of the covering property). Since such $U_{i_0}$ is an open neighbourhood of $g$, there is a positive real number $\epsilon$ such that the open ball $B^\circ_g(\epsilon) \subset U_{i_0}$ is still contained in the patch. It follows that there is an element $x \in B^\circ_g(\epsilon) \cap [0,g) \subset U_{i_0} \cap [0,g)$ and such that there is a finite subset $J \subset I$ with $\{U_i \subset [0,1]\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ a finite open cover of $[0,x)$. It follows that $\{U_i \subset [0,1]\}_{i \in J \subset I} \sqcup \{U_{i_0}\}$ were a finite open cover of $[0,g]$, hence that $g$ itself were still admissible, in contradiction to the assumption.

1. Assume that the set of admissible values were a closed interval $[0,g]$ for $g \lt 1$.
   By assumption there would then be a finite set $J \subset I$ such that $\{U_i \subset [0,1]\}_{i \in J \subset I}$
   were a finite cover of $[0,g]$. Hence there would be an index $i_g \in J$ such that $g \in U_{i_g}$.
   But then by the nature of open subsets in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}$, this $U_{i_g}$ would also
   contain an open ball $B^\circ_g(\epsilon) = (g-\epsilon, g + \epsilon)$. This would mean that
   the set of admissible values includes the open interval $[0,g+ \epsilon)$, contradicting the assumption.

This gives a [[proof by contradiction]].

###### Nonexample
**([[Euclidean space]] is non-compact)**

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \gt 0$, the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}), regarded with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}), is _not_ a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}).

This is not a finite cover, and removing any one of its patches $U_n$, it ceases to be a cover, since the points of the form $(n + \epsilon, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n)$ are contained only in $U_n$ and in no other patch.

###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $Y$ (def. \ref{OpenCover}). We need show that this has a finite sub-cover.

By the continuity of $f$ the [[pre-images]] $f^{-1}(U_i)$ form an [[open cover]] $\{f^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$. Hence by compactness of $X$, there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that
$\{f^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $X$. Finally, by surjectivity of $f$ it it follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Y
      & = f(X)

      & = f\left( \underset{i \in J}{\cup} f^{-1}(U_i) \right)
    \\
      & = \underset{i \in J}{\cup} U_i
  \end{aligned}
$$

where we used that [[images of unions are unions of images]].

This means that also $\{U_i \subset Y\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $Y$, and in particular a finite subcover of the original cover.

If $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[continuous function]] out of a [[compact topological space]] $X$ (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace})

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\longrightarrow} f(X) \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow} Y

The converse to cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact} does not hold in general: the

Since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (prop. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}) the image $f([a,b]) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspace]].

Suppose this image did not contain its maximum. Then $\{(-\infty,x)\}_{x \in f([a,b])}$ were an [[open cover]] of the image, and hence, by its compactness, there would be a finite subcover, hence a finite set $(x_1 \lt x_2 \lt \cdots \lt x_n)$ of points $x_i \in f([a,b])$, such that the union of the $(-\infty,x_i)$ and hence the single set $(-\infty, x_n)$ alone would cover the image. This were in contradiction to the assumption that $x_n \in f([a,b])$ and hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

**(traditional [[extreme value theorem]])**

Let

$$
  f \;\colon\; [a,b] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

be a [[continuous function]] from a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[closed interval]] ($a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$) (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals})
regarded as a [[topological subspace]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) of [[real numbers]] to the [[real numbers]], with the
latter regarded with their [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Then $f$ attains its [[maximum]] and [[minimum]]: there exists $x_{max}, x_{min} \in [a,b]$ such that
for all $x \in [a,b]$ we have

$$
  f([a,b]) = [f(x_{min}), f(x_{max})]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (prop. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact})
the image $f([a,b]) \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspace]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{SubspaceTopology}).
By the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] (prop. \ref{BorelHeine}) this is a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[closed subset]] (def. \ref{MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}, def. \ref{ClosedSubset}). By the nature of the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]], the image is hence a union of [[closed intervals]]. Finally by continuity of $f$ it needs to be a single closed interval, hence
(being bounded) of the form

$$
  f([a,b]) =  [f(x_{min}), f(x_{max})] \;\subset\; \mathbb{R}

+-- {: .num_prop #ClosedProjectionCharacterizationOfCompactness}
###### Proposition
**([[closed-projection characterization of compactness]])

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]]. The following are equivalent:

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]] according to def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace};

1. For every topological space $(Y,\tau_Y)$ then the [[projection]] map out of the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace})

   $$
     \pi_Y
      \;\colon\;
     (Y, \tau_Y) \times (X, \tau_X)
       \longrightarrow
     (Y, \tau_Y)
   $$

   is a [[closed map]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
([due to Todd Trimble](closed-projection+characterization+of+compactness#Acknowledgement))

In one direction, assume that $(X,\tau_X)$ is compact and let $C \subset Y \times X$ be a closed subset.
We need to show that $\pi_Y(C) \subset Y$ is closed.

By lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure} this is equivalent to showing that every point $y \in Y \setminus \pi_Y(C)$
in the complement of $\pi_Y(C)$ has an open neighbourhood $V_y \supset \{y\}$ which does not intersect $\pi_Y(C)$:
$$
  V_y \cap \pi_Y(C) = \emptyset
  \,.
$$
This is clearly equivalent to
$$
  (V_y \times X) \cap C = \emptyset
$$
and this is what we will show.

To this end, consider the set

$$
  \left\{
    U \subset X\, \text{open}
    \;\vert\;
    \underset{ {V \subset Y \, \text{open} } \atop { V \supset \{y\} }  }{\exists}
    \left(
      (V \times U) \cap C = \emptyset
    \right)
  \right\}
$$

Observe that this is an [[open cover]] of $X$: For every $x \in X$ then $(y,x) \notin C$ by assumption of $Y$,
and by closure of $C$ this means that there exists an open neighbourhood of $(y,x)$  in $Y \times X$ not intersecting $C$,
and by nature of the [[product topology]] this contains an open neighbourhood of the form $V \times U$.

Hence by compactness of $X$, there exists a finite subcover $\{ U_j \subset X \}_{j \in J}$ of $X$ and a corresponding
set $\{V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J}$ with $V_j \times U_j \cap C = \emptyset$.

The resulting open neighbourhood

$$
  V \coloneqq \underset{j \in J}{\cap} V_j
$$

of $y$ has the required property:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     V \times X
     & =
     V \times \left( \underset{j \in J}{\cup} U_j \right)
     \\
     & = \underset{j \in J}{\cup}\left( V \times U_j \right)
     \\
     & \subset \underset{j \in J}{\cup} \left( V_j \times U_j \right)
     \\
     & \subset (Y \times X) \setminus C
     \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

Now for the converse:

Assume that $\pi_Y \colon Y \times X \to X$ is a closed map for all $Y$. We need to show
that $X$ is compact. By prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetFormulationOfCompactness} this means equivalently that
for every set $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of closed subsets and satisfying the [[finite intersection property]],
we need to show that $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$.


So consider such a set $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of closed subsets satisfying the [[finite intersection property]].
Construct a new topological space $(Y, \tau_Y)$ by setting

1. $Y \coloneqq X \sqcup \{\infty\}$;

1. $\beta_Y \coloneqq P(X) \sqcup \left\{ (C_i \cup \{\infty\}) \subset Y  \right\}_{i \in I}$ a [[sub-base for a topology|sub-base]] for $\tau_Y$ (def. \ref{TopologyBase}).

Then consider the [[topological closure]] $Cl(\Delta)$ of the "diagonal" $\Delta$ in $Y \times X$

$$
   \Delta
     \coloneqq
   \left\{
      (x,x) \in Y \times X \,\vert\, x \in X
   \right\}
  \,.
$$


We claim that there exists $x \in X$ such that

$$
  (\infty,x) \in Cl(\Delta)
  \,.
$$

This is because

$$
  \pi_Y(Cl(\Delta)) \subset Y \,\,\text{is closed}
$$

by the assumption that $\pi_Y$ is a closed map, and

$$
  X \subset \pi_Y(Cl(\Delta))
$$

by construction. So if $\infty$ were not in $\pi_Y(Cl(\Delta))$, then, by lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure},
it would have an open neighbourhood not intersecting $X$. But by definition of $\tau_Y$, the open neighbourhoods
of $\infty$ are the unions of finite intersections of $C_i \cup \{\infty\}$, and by the assumed [[finite intersection property]]
all their finite intersections do still intersect $X$.

Since thus $(\infty,x) \in Cl(\Delta)$, lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure} gives again that
all of its open neighbourhoods intersect the diagonal.
By the nature of the [[product topology]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})
this means that for all $i \in I$ and all open neighbourhoods $U_x \supset \{x\}$  we have that

$$
  \left(
    (C_i \cup \{ \infty \} ) \times U_x
  \right)
  \;\cap\;
  \Delta
  \;\neq\;
  \emptyset
  \,.
$$

By definition of $\Delta$ this means equivalently that

$$
  C_i \cap U_x \neq \emptyset
$$

for all open neighbourhoods $U_x \supset \{x\}$.

But by closure of $C_i$ and using lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure}, this means that

$$
  x \in C_i
$$

for all $i$, hence that

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset
$$

as required.

This [[closed-projection characterization of compactness]] from prop. \ref{ClosedProjectionCharacterizationOfCompactness}
is most useful, for instance it yields direct proof of the following important facts in [[topology]]:

* The _[[tube lemma]]_, prop. \ref{TheTubeLemma} below,

* The _[[Tychonoff theorem]]_, prop. \ref{TychonoffTheorem} below.

###### Lemma
**([[tube lemma]])**

Let

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]],

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}),

1. $x \in X$ a point,

1. $W \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} X \times Y$ an open subset in the [[product topology]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{TychonoffTheorem}),

such that the $Y$-[[fiber]] over $x$ is contained in $W$:

$$
  \{x\} \times Y \;\subseteq\; W
  \,.
$$

Then there exists an [[open neighborhood]] $U_x$ of $x$ such that the "tube" $U_x \times Y$ around the fiber $\{x \} \times Y$ is still contained:

$$
  U_x \times Y \subseteq W
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let

$$
  C \coloneqq (X \times Y) \setminus W
$$

be the [[complement]] of $W$. Since this is closed, by prop. \ref{ClosedProjectionCharacterizationOfCompactness} also its projection $p_X(C) \subset X$ is closed.

Now

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \{x\} \times Y \subset W
      & \;\Leftrightarrow\;
    \{x\} \times Y \; \cap \; C = \emptyset
    \\
    & \;\Rightarrow\;
    \{x\} \cap  p_X(C) = \emptyset
  \end{aligned}
$$

and hence by the closure of $p_X(C)$ there is (by lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure}) an open neighbourhood $U_x \supset \{x\}$ with

$$
  U_x \cap p_X(C) = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

This means equivalently that $U_x \times Y \cap C = \emptyset$, hence that $U_x \times Y \subset W$.

+-- {: .num_prop #TychonoffTheorem}
###### Proposition
**([[Tychonoff theorem]] --  the [[product space]] of [[compact spaces]] is [[compact space|compact]])**

Let $\{(X_i, \tau_i)\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[set]] of [[compact topological spaces]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}).
Then also their [[product space]] $\underset{i \in I}{\prod}(X_i, \tau_i)$ (example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace})
is compact.

=--

We give a proof of the finitary case of the Tychonoff theorem using the
[[closed-projection characterization of compactness]] from prop. \ref{ClosedProjectionCharacterizationOfCompactness}.
This elementary proof generalizes fairly directly to an elementary proof of the general case: see [here](closed-projection+characterization+of+compactness#TychonoffTheorem).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the finitary case

By prop. \ref{ClosedProjectionCharacterizationOfCompactness} it is sufficient to show that
for every topological space $(Y,\tau_Y)$ then the projection

$$
  \pi_Y
    \;\colon\;
  (Y, \tau_Y)
  \times
  \left(
    \underset{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} (X_i, \tau_i)
  \right)
    \longrightarrow
  (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

is a closed map. We proceed by [[induction]]. For $n = 0$ the statement is obvious.
Suppose it has been proven for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then
the projection for $n+1$ factors is the composite of two consecutive projections

$$
  \pi_Y
    \;\colon\;
  Y \times \left(\underset{i \in \{1, \cdots, n + 1\} }{\prod} X_i \right)
    =
  Y \times \left(\underset{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\} }{\prod} X_i \right) \times X_{n+1}
    \longrightarrow
  Y \times \left(\underset{i \in \{1, \cdots, ,n\} }{\prod} X_i \right)
    \longrightarrow
  Y
  \,.
$$


By prop. \ref{ClosedProjectionCharacterizationOfCompactness},
the first map here is closed since $(X_{n+1}, \tau_{n+1})$ is compact by the assumption of the proposition, and similarly the second is closed
by induction assumtion. Hence the composite is a closed map.


=--


Of course we also want to claim that [[sequentially compact metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}) are compact
as topological spaces when regarded with their [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}):

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSpaceSequenceConverging}

**([[convergence|converging]] [[sequence]] in a [[topological space]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) and let
$(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[sequence]] of points $(x_n)$ in $X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}).
We say that this sequence _[[convergence|converges]]_ in $(X,\tau)$ to a point $x_\infty \in X$,
denoted

$$
  x_n \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
$$

if for each [[open neighbourhood]] $U_{x_\infty}$ of $x_\infty$ there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
for all $n \geq k$ then $x_n \in U_{x_\infty}$:

$$
  \left(
    x_n \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
  \right)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
  \underset{{U_{x_\infty} \in \tau_X} \atop {x_\infty \in U_{X_\infty}}}{\forall}

1. $(X,d)$ is a [[sequentially compact metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}) hence a [[sequentially compact topological space]] (def. \ref{SequentiallyCompactTopologicalSpace}).

=--


+-- {: .proof #ProofOfSequentiallyCompactMetricSpacesAreEquivCompact}
###### Proof
of prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace} and  prop. \ref{SequentiallyCompactMetricSpacesAreEquivCompact}

Assume first that $(X,d)$ is a [[compact topological space]]. Let $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[sequence]] in $X$. We need to show that it has a sub-sequence which [[convergence|converges]].

Consider the [[topological closures]] of the sub-sequences that omit the first $n$ elements of the sequence

$$
  F_n
   \;\coloneqq\;
  Cl(\left\{
    x_k \,\vert\, k \geq n
  \right\})
$$

and write

$$
  U_n \coloneqq X \setminus F_n
$$

for their [[open subset|open]] [[complements]].

Assume now that the [[intersection]] of all the $F_n$ were [[empty set|empty]]

$$
  (\star)
  \phantom{AA}
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cap} F_n \;= \; \emptyset
$$

or equivalently that the [[union]] of all the $U_n$ were all of $X$

$$
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} U_n
  \;=\;
  X
  \,,
$$

hence that $\{U_n \subset X\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ were an [[open cover]]. By the assumption that $X$ is compact, this
would imply that there were a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $\{i_1 \lt i_2 \lt  \cdots \lt i_k\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ with

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    X & = U_{i_1} \cup U_{i_2} \cup \cdots \cup U_{i_k}
    \\
    & = U_{i_k}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This in turn would mean that $F_{i_k} = \empty$, which contradicts the construction of $F_{i_k}$. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]] that assumption $(\ast)$ is wrong, and hence that there must exist an element

$$
  x \in \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cap} F_n
  \,.
$$

By definition of [[topological closure]] this means that for all $n$ the [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(1/(n+1))$ around $x$ of [[radius]] $1/(n+1)$ must intersect the $n$th of the above subsequences:

$$
  B^\circ_x(1/(n+1))
  \,\cap\,
  \{x_k \,\vert\, k \geq n \}
  \;\neq\;
  \emptyset
  \,.
$$

If we [[axiom of choice|choose]] one point $(x'_n)$ in the $n$th such intersection for all $n$ this defines a sub-sequence, which converges to $x$.

In summary this proves that _compact_ implies _sequentially compact_ for metric spaces.

For the converse, assume now that $(X,d)$ is sequentially compact. Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $X$. We need to show that there exists a finite sub-cover.

Now by the [[Lebesgue number lemma]], there exists a positive real number $\delta \gt 0$ such that for each $x \in X$ there is $i_x \in I$ such that $B^\circ_x(\delta) \subset U_{i_x}$.
Moreover, since [[sequentially compact metric spaces are totally bounded]], there exists then  a [[finite set]] $S \subset X$ such that

$$
   X
     \;=\;
   \underset{s \in S}{\cup}
   B^\circ_s(\delta)
   \,.
$$

Therefore $\{U_{i_s} \to X\}_{s \in S}$ is a finite sub-cover as required.

###### Remark
**([[nets]] fix the shortcomings of [[sequences]])**

That [[compact topological space|compactness]] of topological spaces is not detected by
[[convergence]] of [[sequences]] (remark \ref{SequentiallyCompactNeitherImpliesNorIsImpliedByCompactness})
may be regarded as a shortcoming of the concept of _[[sequence]]_. While a sequence is indexed
over the [[natural numbers]], the concept of [[convergence]] of sequnces only invokes that the natural
numbers form a _[[directed set]]_. Hence the concept of convergence immediately generalizes to
sets of points in a space which are indexed over an arbitrary [[directed set]]. This is called a _[[net]]_.

And with these the expected statement does become true (for a [[proof]] see [here](net#CompactSpacesEquivalentlyHaveConvergetSubnets)):

$\;\;\;\;$_A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]]
precisely if every [[net]] in $X$ has a [[convergence|converging]] [[subnet]]._


In fact convergence of nets also detects [[closed subsets]] in topological spaces (hence their topology as such),
and it detects the continuity of functions between topological spaces. It also detects for instance the Hausdorff property.
(For detailed statements and proofs see _[here](net#RelationToTopology)_.) Hence when [[analysis]] is cast in terms
of [[nets]] instead of just sequences, then it raises to the same level of generality as topology.

  U_x \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y}{\cap} U_{x,s}
$$

of the corresponding open neighbourhoods of $x$ is still open, and by construction it is disjoint from all the $U_{s}$, hence also from their union

$$
  U_Y \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y}{\cup}  U_s

1. $C \subset X$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}) [[topological subspace]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}).

###### Proposition
**([[Heine-Borel theorem]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the $n$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] via example \ref{EuclideanNorm},
regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Then for a [[topological subspace]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the following are equivalent:

1. $S$ is  [[compact topological space|compact]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace});

1. $S$ is [[closed subset|closed]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) and [[bounded subset|bounded]] (def. \ref{MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}).

=--

+-- {: .proof #BorelHeineProof}
###### Proof

First consider a [[subset]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ which is closed and bounded. We need to show that
regarded as a [[topological subspace]] it is [[compact topological space|compact]].

The assumption that $S$ is bounded by (hence contained in) some [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$
implies that it is contained in $\{ (x_i)_{i = 1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^n \,\vert\, -\epsilon \leq x_i \leq \epsilon \}$.
By example \ref{ClosedIntervalsProduct}, this  topological subspace is homeomorphic to the $n$-cube

$$
  [-\epsilon, \epsilon]^n
  =
  \underset{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} [-\epsilon, \epsilon]
  \,,
$$

hence to the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}) of $n$ copies of
the closed interval with itself.

Since the closed interval $[-\epsilon, \epsilon]$
is compact by example \ref{CompactClosedInterval}, the [[Tychonoff theorem]] (prop. \ref{TychonoffTheorem})
implies that this $n$-cube is compact.

Since [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] (lemma \ref{SubsetsInClosedSubspace})
the closed subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is also closed as a subset $S \subset [-\epsilon, \epsilon]^n$.
Since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]]
(lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}) this implies that $S$ is compact.

Conversely, assume that $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact subspace. We need to show that it is closed and bounded.

The first statement follows since
the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace})
and since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (prop. \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}).

Hence what remains is to show that $S$ is bounded.

To that end, choose any [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}$
and consider the [[open cover]] of all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the open [[n-cubes]]

$$
  (k_1-\epsilon, k_1+1+\epsilon)
    \times
  (k_2-\epsilon, k_2+1+\epsilon)
    \times
      \cdots
    \times
  (k_n-\epsilon, k_n+1+\epsilon)
$$

for [[n-tuples]] of [[integers]] $(k_1, k_2 , \cdots, k_n ) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$.
The restrictions of these to $S$ hence form an open cover of the subspace $S$. By the assumption that
$S$ is compact, there is then a finite subset of $n$-tuples of integers such that the
corresponding $n$-cubes still cover $S$. But the union of any finite number of bounded closed $n$-cubes
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is clearly a bounded subset, and hence so is $S$.

1. since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}) it follows that $C \subset X$ is also compact;

1. since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}) it then follows that $f(C) \subset Y$ is compact;

1. since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (prop. \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}) it finally follow that $f(C)$ is also closed in $Y$.

For the second statement we need to show that if $C \subset Y$ is a [[compact topological space|compact subset]], then also its [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(C)$ is compact.

Now

1. since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (prop. \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}) it follows that $C \subset Y$ is closed;

1. since [[pre-images]] under continuous functions of closed subsets are closed (prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}), also $f^{-1}(C) \subset X$ is closed;

1. since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}), it follows that $f^{-1}(C)$ is compact.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First we claim that $(X,\tau)$ is [[regular topological space|regular]]. To show this, we need to find for each point $x \in X$ and each closed subset $Y \in X$ not containing $x$ disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_Y \supset Y$. But since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}), the subset $Y$ is in fact compact, and hence this is the statement of lemma \ref{SeparationByNeighbourhoodsOfPointsFromCompactSubsetsInHausdorffSpaces}.

Next to show that $(X,\tau)$ is indeed normal, we apply the idea of the proof of lemma \ref{SeparationByNeighbourhoodsOfPointsFromCompactSubsetsInHausdorffSpaces} once more:

Let $Y_1, Y_2 \subset X$ be two disjoint closed subspaces. By the previous statement then for every point $y_1 \in Y$ we find disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_{y_1} \supset \{y_1\}$ and $U_{Y_2,y_1} \supset Y_2$. The union of the $U_{y_1}$ is a cover of $Y_1$, and by compactness of $Y_1$ there is a finite subset $S \subset Y$ such that

$$
  U_{Y_1} \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y_1}{\cup} U_{y_1}
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $Y_1$ and

$$
  U_{Y_2} \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y}{\cap} U_{Y_2,s}

is an open neighbourhood of $Y_2$, and both are disjoint.

be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace});

1. $(Y, \tau_Y)$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $\pi \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[surjective function]].

(def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

###### Proof

We need to show that a subset $U \subset Y$ is an [[open subset]] of $(Y , \tau_Y)$ precisely if its [[pre-image]] $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset X$
is an open subset in $(X,\tau_X)$. Equivalenty, as in prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}, we need to show that $U$ is a [[closed subset]]
precisely if $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is a closed subset. The implication

$$
  \left( U \, \text{closed}\right) \,\Rightarrow\, \left( f^{-1}(U) \,\text{closed}\right)
$$

follows via prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity} from the continuity of $\pi$. The implication

$$
  \left( f^{-1}(U) \,\text{closed}\right)
   \,\Rightarrow\,
  \left( U \, \text{closed}\right)

Let

$$
  \pi \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that

1. $(X, \tau)$ is a [[compact Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}, def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $\pi$ is a [[surjection]] and $\tau_Y$ is the corresponding [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

Then the following are equivalent

1. $(Y, \tau_Y)$ is itself a [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $\pi$ is a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The implicaton $\left( (Y, \tau_Y)\, \text{Hausdorff} \right) \Rightarrow \left( \pi \, \text{closed}  \right)$
is given by prop. \ref{MapsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}. We need to show the converse.

Hence assume that $\pi$ is a closed map. We need to show that for every pair of
distinct points $y_1 \neq y_2 \in Y$ there exist [[open neighbourhoods]] $U_{y_1}, U_{y_2} \in \tau_Y$
which are disjoint, $U_{y_1} \cap U_{y_2} = \emptyset$.

First notice that the [[singleton]] subsets $\{x\}, \{y\} \in Y$ are closed. This is because they are images
of singleton subsets in $X$, by surjectivity of $f$, and because singletons in a Hausdorff space are closed
by prop, \ref{TnImplications} and prop. \ref{T1InTermsOfTopologicalClosure}, and because images under $f$ of
closed subsets are closed, by the assumption that $f$ is a closed map.

It follows that the [[pre-images]]

$$
  C_1 \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{y_1\})
  \phantom{AA}
  C_2 \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{y_2\})
  \,.
$$

are [[closed subsets]] of $X$.

Now again since [[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]] (prop. \ref{CompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal}) it follows (by def. \ref{NormalSpace}) that we may find disjoint open subset $U_1, U_2 \in \tau_X$
such that

$$
  C_1 \subset U_1 \phantom{AAA} C_2 \subset U_2
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by lemma \ref{SaturatedOpenNeighbourhoodsOfSaturatedClosedSubsets} we may find these $U_i$ such that they
are both [[saturated subsets]] (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated}). Therefore finally lemma \ref{DetectViaSaturatedSubsetsContinuousQuotientMap}
says that the images $\pi(U_i)$ are open in $(Y,\tau_Y)$. These are now clearly disjoint open neighbourhoods of $y_1$ and $y_2$.

regarded as a [[topological subspace]] of the 2-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) equipped with its
[[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

This is clearly a [[continuous function]] and a [[bijection]] on the underlying sets.
Moreover, since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact})
and since the closed interval $[0,1]$ is compact (example \ref{CompactClosedInterval}) we also obtain another proof that
the [[circle]] is compact.

Hence by prop. \ref{ContinuousBijectionsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreHomeomorphisms}
the above map is in fact a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  [0,2\pi]/\sim \;\simeq\; S^1

is _not_ a homeomorphism, even though this, too, is a bijection on the the underlying sets.
But the [[half-open interval]] $[0,2\pi)$ is not compact (for instance by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]], prop. \ref{BorelHeine}), and hence prop. \ref{ContinuousBijectionsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreHomeomorphisms}
does not apply.

### Locally compact spaces

A topological space is _[[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]_ if each point has a
[[compact topological space|compact]] [[neighbourhood]]. Or rather, this is the case in locally
compact [[Hausdorff spaces]]. Without the Hausdorff condition one asks that these compact neighbourhoods
exist in a certain controlled way (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace} below).

It turns out (prop. \ref{LocallyCompactHausdorffAreSubspacesOfCompactHausdorff} below)
that locally compact Hausdorff spaces are precisely the open [[subspaces]] of
the [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]  discussed [above](#CompactSpaces).

A key application of local compactness ist that the _[[mapping spaces]]_ (topological spaces
of continuous functions, def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} below) out of a locally compact space behave as expected from mapping spaces.
(prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyOfMappingSpace} below). This gives rise for instance the [[loop spaces]] and [[path spaces]]
(example \ref{LoopSpace} below) which become of paramount importance in the discussion of [[homotopy theory]].

For the purposes of [[point-set topology]] local compactness is
useful as a criterion for identifying [[paracompact topological space|paracompactness]]
(prop. \ref{ParacompactFromLocallyCompactAndSigmacompact} below).

**(varying terminology regarding "locally compact")**

On top of the terminology issue inherited from that of "compact", remark \ref{CompactTerminology}
(regarding whether or not to require "[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]]" with "compact"; we do not),
the definition of "locally compact" is subject to further ambiguity in the literature.
There are various definitions of locally compact spaces alternative to def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace},
we consider one such alternative definition below in def. \ref{LocalCompactnessViaCompactNeighbourhoodBase}.

For [[Hausdorff topological spaces]] all these definitions
happen to be equivalent (prop. \ref{InHausdorffSpacesDefinitionsOfLocalCompactnessAgree} below), but in general they are not.

The version we state in def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace} is the one that gives various results

Let $x \in X$ be a point and let $U_x \subset X$ an open neighbourhood.  We need to produce a smaller open neighbourhood
whose closure is compact and still contained in $U_x$.

By the nature of the [[subspace topology]] there exists an open subset $V_x\subset K$ such that $U_x = X \cap V_x$.
Since $X \subset K$ is assumed to be open, it follows that $U_x$ is also open as a subset of $K$.
Since [[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]] (prop. \ref{CompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal}) it
follows by prop. \ref{T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures} that
there exists a smaller open neighbourhood $W_x \subset K$ whose [[topological closure]] is still contained in $U_x$,

In the discussion of [[locally Euclidean spaces]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace} below), as well as in other contexts,
a definition of local compactness that in the absence of Hausdorffness is slightly weaker
than def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace} (recall remark \ref{LocallyCompactVarying}) is useful:

###### Definition
**([[locally compact topological space|local compactness]] via compact [[neighbourhood base]])**

A [[topological space]] is _[[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]_ if for
for every point $x \in X$ every [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ contains a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[neighbourhood]] $K_x \subset U_x$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #InHausdorffSpacesDefinitionsOfLocalCompactnessAgree}
###### Proposition
**(equivalence of definitions of local compactness for Hausdorff spaces)**

If $X$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]], then the two definitions of [[locally compact topological space|local compactness]]
of $X$

1.  definition \ref{LocalCompactnessViaCompactNeighbourhoodBase} (every open neighbourhood contains a compact neighbourhood),

1. definition \ref{LocallyCompactSpace} (every open neighbourhood contains a compact neighbourhood that is the topological closure of an open neighbourhood)

are equivalent.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Generally, definition \ref{LocallyCompactSpace} directly implies definition \ref{LocalCompactnessViaCompactNeighbourhoodBase}. We need to show that Hausdorffness implies the converse.

Hence assume that for every point $x \in X$ then every open neighbourhood $U_x \supset \{x\}$ contains a compact neighbourhood. We need to show that it then also contains the closure $Cl(V_x)$ of a smaller open neighbourhood and such that this closure is compact.

So let $K_x \subset U_x$ be a compact neighbourhood. Being a neighbourhood, it has a non-trivial [[interior]] which is an open neighbouhood

$$
  \{x\} \subset Int(K_x) \subset K_x \subset U_x \subset X
  \,.
$$

Since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (lemma \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}), it follows that $K_x \subset X$ is a closed subset. This implies that the [[topological closure]] of its interior as a subset of $X$ is still contained in $K_x$ (since the topological closure is the smallest closed subset containing the given subset, by def. \ref{ClosedSubset}): $Cl(Int(K_x)) \subset K_x$. Since [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] (lemma \ref{SubsetsInClosedSubspace}), $Cl(Int(K_x))$ is also closed as a subset of the compact subspace $K_x$.
Now since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}), it follows that this closure is also compact as a subspace of $K_x$, and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (prop. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}), it finally follows that it is also compact as a subspace of $X$:

$$
  \{x\} \subset Int(K_x) \subset \underset{\text{compact}}{Cl(Int(K_x))} \subset \underset{}{K_x} \subset U_x \subset X
  \,.
$$

A key application of locally compact spaces is that the [[compact-open topology|space of maps]]
out of them into any given topological space (example \ref{CompactOpenTopology} below)
satisfies the expected [[universal property]] of a [[mapping space]] (prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyOfMappingSpace} below).

###### Example
**(topological [[mapping space]] with [[compact-open topology]])**

For

1. $(X, \tau_X)$ a [[locally compact topological space]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace})

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ any [[topological space]]

then the _[[compact-open topology|mapping space]]_

$$
  Maps\left(
    (X,\tau_X), (Y,\tau_Y)
  \right)
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \left(
    Hom_{Top}(X,Y) , \tau_{\text{cpt-op}}
  \right)
$$

is the [[topological space]]

* whose underlying set $Hom_Top(X,Y)$ is the set of [[continuous functions]] $X \to Y$;

* whose topology $\tau_{\text{cpt-op}}$ is generated from the [[topological basis|sub-basis for the topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase})
  which is given by subsets to denoted

  $U^K \subset Hom_{Top}(X,Y)$ for labels

  * $K \subset Y$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] subset,

  * $U \subset X$ an [[open subset]]

  and defined to be those subsets of all those [[continuous functions]] $f$ that take $K$ to $U$:

  $$
    U^K
    \;\coloneqq\;
    \left\{
      f \colon X \overset{\text{continuous}}{\longrightarrow} Y
      \;\;\vert\;\;
      f(K) \subset U
    \right\}

Accordingly this topology $\tau_{\text{cpt-op}}$ is called the _[[compact-open topology]]_ on the set of functions.

and $(-)\times (-)$ denotes forming the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{InfiniteProductTopologicalSpace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see the continuity of the evaluation map:

Let $V \subset Y$ be an open subset. We need to show that $ev^{-1}(V) = \{(x, f) \vert f(x) \in V\}$
is a union of products of the form $U \times V^K$ with $U\subset X$ open and $U^K \subset Hom_{Set}(K,U)$ a basic open according to def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}.

For $(x, f) \in ev^{-1}(V)$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V) \subset X$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$, by continuity of $f$.
By local compactness of $X$, there is a compact subset $K \subset f^{-1}(V)$ which is still a neighbourhood of $x$.
Since $f$ also still takes that into $V$,
we have found an open neighbourhood

$$
  (x,f) \in {K \times V^K} \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} ev^{-1}(V)
$$

with respect to the product topology. Since this is still contained in $ev^{-1}(V)$, for all $(x,f)$ as above,
$ev^{-1}(V)$ is exhibited
as a union of opens, and is hence itself open.

Regarding the second point:

In one direction, let $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \times (Y, \tau_Y) \to (Z \, \tau_Z)$ be a continuous function, and let $U^K \subset Maps(X,Y)$
be a sub-basic open. We need to show that the set

$$
  \tilde f^{-1}(U)
    =
  \left\{
    z \in Z \;\vert\;  f(K,z) \subset U
  \right\}
   \;\subset\;
  Z
$$

is open. To that end, observe that $f(K,z) \subset U$ means that $K \times \{z\} \subset f^{-1}(U)$, where $f^{-1}(U) \subset X \times Y$ is open by the continuity of $f$.
Hence in the [[topological subspace]] $K \times Z \subset X \times Y$ the inclusion

$$
  K \times \{z\} \subset \left( f^{-1}(U) \cap (K \times Z) \right)
$$

is an open neighbourhood. Since $K$ is compact, the [[tube lemma]] (prop. \ref{TheTubeLemma}) gives an
open neighbourhood $V_z \supset \{z\}$ in $Y$, hence an open neighbourhood $K \times V_z \subset K \times Y$,
which is still contained in the original pre-image:

$$
  K \times V_z \;\subset\; f^{-1}(U) \cap (K \times Z) \;\subset\; f^{-1}(U)
  \,.
$$

This shows that with every point $z \in \tilde f^{-1}\left(U^K\right)$ also an open neighbourhood of $z$ is contained in $\tilde f^{-1}\left(U^K\right)$,
hence that the latter is a union of open subsets, and hence itself open.

In the other direction, assume that $\tilde f \colon Z \to Maps((X,\tau_X),(Y,\tau_Y))$ is continuous:
We need to show that $f$ is continuous. But observe that $f$ is the [[composition|composite]]

$$
  f
  =
  (X, \tau_X) \times (Z,\tau_Z)
    \overset{id{(X,\tau_X)} \times \tilde f}{\longrightarrow}
  (X, \tau_X)
  \times
  Maps((X,\tau_X), (Y,\tau_Y))
    \overset{ev}{\longrightarrow}
  (X,\tau_X)
  \,.
$$

Here the first function $id \times \tilde f$ is continuous since $\tilde f$ is by assumption since the product of two continuous functions
is again continuous (example \ref{FunctorialProductSpace}). The second function $ev$ is continuous by the first point above.
hence $f$ is continuous.

**([[compact-open topology|topological mapping space]] is [[exponential object]])**

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyOfMappingSpace}
says that the [[mapping space]] construction with its [[compact-open topology]] from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}
is an _[[exponential object]]_ or _[[internal hom]]_. This just means that it beahves in all abstract ways just as
a [[function set]] does for plain functions, but it does so for continuous functions and being itself
equipped with a topology.

Moreover, the construction of topological mapping spaces in example \ref{CompactOpenTopology}
extends to a [[functor]] (remark \ref{TopCategory})

$$
  (-)^{(-)} \;\colon\; Top_{lcpt}^{op} \times Top \longrightarrow Top
$$

from the [[product category]] of the category [[Top]] of all [[topological spaces]] (remark \ref{TopCategory})

(exmaple \ref{CompactOpenTopology}) exists. This is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) to the space $(x,\tau)$ itself:

Let $(X,\tau)$ be any [[topological space]].

1. The [[circle]] $S^1$ (example \ref{SpheresAndDisks}) is a [[compact Hausdorff space]] (example \ref{ExamplesOfCompactHausdorffSpaces})
   hence, by prop. \ref{OpenSubspacesOfCompactHausdorffSpacesAreLocallyCompact}, a [[locally compact topological space]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}). Accordingly the [[mapping space]]

   $$
     \mathcal{L} X \coloneqq Maps( S^1, (X,\tau) )
   $$

   exists (def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}). This is called the _[[free loop space]]_ of $(X,\tau)$.

   If both $S^1$ and $X$ are equipped with a choice of point ("[[basepoint]]") $s_0 \in S^1$, $x_0 \in X$, then the [[topological subspace]]

   $$
     \Omega X \subset \mathcal{L}X
   $$

   on those functions which take the basepoint of $S^1$ to that of $X$, is called the _[[loop space]]_ of $X$,
   or sometimes _[[based loop space]]_, for emphasis.

1. Similarly the [[closed interval]] is a [[compact Hausdorff space]] (example \ref{ExamplesOfCompactHausdorffSpaces})
   hence, by prop. \ref{OpenSubspacesOfCompactHausdorffSpacesAreLocallyCompact}, a [[locally compact topological space]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}). Accordingly the [[mapping space]]

   $$
     Maps( [0,1], (X,\tau) )
   $$

   exists (def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}). Again if $X$ is equipped with a choice of basepoint $x_0 \in X$, then the [[topological subspace]]
   of those functions that take $0 \in [0,1]$ to that chosen basepoint is called the _[[path space]]_ of $(X\tau)$:

   $$
     P X \subset Maps( [0,1], (X,\tau) )
     \,.

Notice that we may encode these subspaces more abstractly in terms of [[universal properties]]:

The path space and the loop space are characterized, up to [[homeomorphisms]], as being the [[limit|limiting cones]]
in the following [[pullback]] diagrams of topological spaces (example \ref{Pushout}):

###### Lemma
**([[one-point compactification]] is well-defined)**

The [[topological space|topology]] on the [[one-point compactification]] in def. \ref{OnePointExtension} is indeed well defined in that the given set of subsets is indeed closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The unions and finite intersections of the open subsets inherited from $X$ are closed among themselves by the assumption that $X$ is a topological space.

It is hence sufficient to see that

1. the unions and finite intersection of the $(X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$ are closed among themselves,

1. the union and intersection of a subset of the form $U \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} X \subset X^\ast$ with one of the form $(X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$ is again of one of the two kinds.

Regarding the first statement: Under [[de Morgan duality]]

$$
  \underset{
     i \in \underset{\text{finite}}{J}
  }{\cap}
   (X \backslash CK_i \cup \{\infty\})
  =
  X \backslash
  \left(
     \left(\underset{i \in \underset{\text{finite}}{J}}{\cup} CK_i \right)
     \cup
     \{\infty\}
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} ( X \backslash C_i \cup \{\infty\} )
  =
  X \backslash
  \left(
    \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} CK_i \right)
    \cup
    \{\infty\}
  \right)
$$

and so the first statement follows from the fact that finite unions of compact subspaces and arbitrary intersections of closed compact subspaces are themselves again compact ([this prop.](compact+space#UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces)).

Regarding the second statement: That $U \subset X$ is open means that there exists a closed subset $C \subset X$ with $U = X\backslash C$. Now using [[de Morgan duality]] we find

1. for intersections:

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       U \cap ( (X\backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\} )
       & =
       (X \backslash C) \cap (X \backslash CK)
       \\
       & =
       X \backslash ( C \cup CK )
     \end{aligned}
   $$

   Since finite unions of closed subsets are closed, this is again an open subset of $X$;

1. for unions:

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       U \cup (X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}
       & =
       (X \backslash C) \cup (X \backslash CU) \cup \{\infty\}
       \\
       & =
       (X \backslash (C \cap CK)) \cup \{\infty\}
     \end{aligned}
     \,.
   $$

   For this to be open in $X^\ast$ we need that $C \cap CK$ is again compact. This follows because [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] and because [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]].

Pick a point $\infty \in S^n$. By [[stereographic projection]] we have a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  S^n \setminus \{\infty\} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n

$$

With this it only remains to see that for $U_\infty \supset \{\infty\}$ an open neighbourhood of $\infty$ in $S^n$ then the complement $S^n \setminus U_\infty$ is compact closed, and cnversely that the complement of every compact closed subset of $S^n \setminus \{\infty\}$ is an open neighbourhood of $\{\infty\}$.

Observe that under [[stereographic projection]] (example \ref{StandardStereographicProjection}) the open subspaces $U_\infty \setminus \{\infty\} \subset S^n \setminus \{\infty\}$ are identified precisely with the [[closed subset|closed]] and [[bounded subsets]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$. (Closure is immediate, boundedness follows because an open neighbourhood of $\{\infty\} \in S^n$ needs to contain an open ball around $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n \simeq S^n \setminus \{-\infty\}$ in the _other_ stereographic projection, which under change of chart gives a bounded subset. )

By the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] (prop.  \ref{BorelHeine}) the closed and bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are precisely the compact, and hence the compact closed, subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n \simeq S^n \setminus \{\infty\}$.

###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X^\ast\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]].  We need to show that this has a finite subcover.

That we have a cover means that

1. there must exist $i_\infty \in I$ such that $U_{i \infty} \supset \{\infty\}$ is an [[open neighbourhood]] of the extra point. But since, by construction, the only open subsets containing that point are of the form $(X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$, it follows that there is a compact closed subset $CK \subset X$ with $X \backslash CK \subset U_{i \infty}$.

1. $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in i}$ is in particular an open cover of that closed compact subset $CK \subset X$. This being compact means that there is a finite subset $J \subset I$ so that $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \J \subset X}$ is still a cover of $CK$.

Together this implies that

$$
  \{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}
  \cup
  \{ U_{i_\infty} \}

is a finite subcover of the original cover.

###### Proof

It is clear that if $X$ is not Hausdorff then $X^\ast$ is not.

For the converse, assume that $X$ is Hausdorff.

Since $X^\ast = X \cup \{\infty\}$ as underlying sets, we only need to check that for $x \in X$ any point, then there is an open neighbourhood $U_x \subset X \subset X^\ast$ and an open neighbourhood $V_\infty \subset X^\ast$ of the extra point which are disjoint.

That $X$ is locally compact implies by definition that there exists an open neighbourhood $U_k \supset \{x\}$ whose [[topological closure]] $CK \coloneqq Cl(U_x)$ is a closed compact neighbourhood $CK \supset \{x\}$. Hence

$$
  V_\infty \coloneqq (X \backslash CK ) \cup \{\infty\} \subset X^\ast

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Then the evident inclusion function

$$

into its [[one-point compactification]] (def. \ref{OnePointExtension}) is

###### Proof

Regarding the first point: For $U \subset X$ open and $CK \subset X$ closed and compact, the [[pre-images]] of the corresponding open subsets in $X^\ast$ are

$$
  i^{-1}(U) = U
  \phantom{AAAA}
  i^{-1}( (X \backslash CK) \cup \infty ) = X \backslash CK

which are open in $X$.


Regarding the second point:  The image of an open subset $U \subset X$ is $i(U) = U \subset X^\ast$, which is open by definition

Regarding the third point: We need to show that $i \colon X \to i(X) \subset X^\ast$ is a [[homeomorphism]]. This is immediate from the definition of $X^\ast$.

That every open subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is locally compact Hausdorff was the statement of

But if $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff, then its [[one-point compactification]] $X^\ast$ is compact Hausdorff
by prop. \ref{OnePointExtensionIsCompact} and prop. \ref{HausdorffOnePointCompactification}. Moreover the

**([[proper maps to locally compact spaces are closed]])**

Let

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]],

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}, def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}),

1. $f \colon X \to Y$ a [[proper map]] (def. \ref{ProperContinuous}).

Then $f$ is a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $C \subset X$ be a [[closed subset]]. We need to show that $f(C) \subset Y$ is closed.
By lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure} this means we need to show
that every $y \in Y \setminus f(C)$ has an open neighbourhood $U_y \supset \{y\}$ not intersecting $f(C)$..

By local compactness of $(Y,\tau_Y)$ (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}), $y$ has an open neighbourhood $V_y$ whose topological closure $Cl(V_y)$ is compact. Hence since $f$ is proper, also $f^{-1}(Cl(V_y)) \subset X$ is compact. Then also the intersection $C \cap f^{-1}(Cl(V_y))$ is compact, and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (prop. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}) so is

$$
  f\left( C \cap f^{-1}(Cl(V_y)) \right)
  =
  f(C) \cap (Cl(V))

$$

This is also a [[closed subset]], since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (lemma \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}). Therefore

$$
  U_y \coloneqq V_y \setminus ( f(C) \cap (Cl(V_y)) ) = V_y \setminus f(C)

is an open neighbourhod of $y$ not intersecting $f(C)$.

1. $f$ is a closed [[embedding of topological spaces]] (def. \ref{EmbeddingOfTopologicalSpaces}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, if $f$ is an injective proper map,
then since [[proper maps to locally compact spaces are closed]], it follows that $f$ is also  [[closed map]]. The claim then follows since [[closed injections are embeddings]] (prop. \ref{OpenClosedContinuousInjectionsAreEmbeddings}), and since the image of a closed map is closed.

Conversely, if $f$ is a closed embedding, we only need to show that the embedding map is proper. So for $C \subset Y$ a [[compact subspace]], we need to show that the [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(C) \subset X$ is also compact. But since $f$ is an injection (being an embedding), that pre-image is just the intersection $f^{-1}(C) \simeq C \cap f(X)$. By the nature of the [[subspace topology]], this is compact if $C$ is.

## Paracompact spaces
 {#ParacompactSpaces}


The concept of [[compact topological space|compactness]] in topology ([above](#CompactSpaces))
has several evident weakenings of interest. One is that of _[[paracompact topological space|paracompactness]]_
(def. \ref{ParacompactSpace} below). The concept of paracompact topological spaces leads over
from plain [[topology]] to actual [[geometry]]. In particular the [[topological manifolds]] discussed [below](#Manifolds)
are paracompact topological spaces.

A key property is that [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces]] are equivalently those (prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffEquivalentToexistenceOfParititionsOfUnity} below) all whose [[open covers]] admit a subordinate [[partition of unity]] (def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity} below), namely a set of [[real number|real]]-valued [[continuous functions]]
each of which is [[support|supported]] in only one patch of the cover, but whose [[sum]] is the unit function.
Existence of such partitions implies that structures on topological spaces which are glued together via [[linear maps]]
(such as [[vector bundles]]) are well behaved.

Finally in [[algebraic topology]] paracompact spaces are important as for them [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] may be computed in terms of [[Cech cohomology]].

$$

Let $\mathcal{U} = \{ U_j \subset \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (X_i, \tau_i) \}_{j \in J}$ be an [[open cover]].
We need to produce a locally finite refinement.

Since each $X_i$ is open in the disjoint union, the intersections $U_i \cap X_j$ are all open, and
hence by forming all these intersections we obtain a [[refinement]] of the original cover by a disjoint union
of open covers $\mathcal{U}_i$ of $(X_i, \tau_i)$ for all $i \in I$. By the assumption that
each $(X_i, \tau_i)$ is paracompact, each $\mathcal{U}_i$ has a locally finite refinement $\mathcal{V}_i$.
Accordingly the disjoint union $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup}\mathcal{V}_i$ is a locally finite refinement
of $\mathcal{U}$.

In identifying [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces]] using the recognition principles that
we establish [below](#ExamplesParacompactSpaces) it is often useful
(as witnessed for instance by prop. \ref{ParacompactFromLocallyCompactAndSigmacompact} and prop. \ref{RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison} below) to consider two closely
related properties of topological spaces:

###### Example
**([[Euclidean space]] is second-countable)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Consider the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[Euclidean norm|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology}). Then $\mathbb{R}^n$
is [[second-countable topological space|second countable]] (def. \ref{CountableSecond}).

A [[countable set]] of [[topological base|base open subsets]] is given by the [[open balls]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ of [[rational number|rational]] [[radius]] $\epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0} \subset \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and centered at points with [[rational number|rational]] [[coordinates]]: $x \in \mathbb{Q}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that this is still a [[base for a topology|base]], it is sufficient to see that every point inside very
[[open ball]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is contains in an open  ball of rational radius with rational coordinates of its
center that is still itself contained in the original open ball.

To that end, let $x$ be a point inside an [[open ball]]
and let $d \in \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}$ be its [[distance]] from the [[boundary]] of the ball.
By the fact that the rational numbers are a [[dense subset]] of $\mathbb{R}$, we may find $\epilon \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that
$0 \lt \epsilon \lt d/2$ and then we may find $x' \in \mathbb{Q}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $x' \in B_x^\circ(d/2)$.
This open ball contains $x$ and is contained in the original open ball.

### Examples

* [[metric spaces]] (prop. \ref{ParacompactMetricSpace}),

* [[CW-complexes]] (example \ref{ParacompactHausdorffCWComplexes}).


In order to discuss these, we first consider some recognition principles of paracompactness:

1. [[locally compact and second-countable spaces are sigma-compact]] (prop. \ref{SigmaCompactFromLocallyCompactAndSecondCountable} below)

1. [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]] (prop. \ref{ParacompactFromLocallyCompactAndSigmacompact} below)

on recognition of paracompactness (prop. \ref{RegularSpacesWherOpenCoveringIsRefinedbyCountableLocallyFiniteConnectionsofOpensAreParacompact} below).

1. [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}),

1. [[second-countable topological space|second-contable]] (def. \ref{CountableSecond}).

Then $X$ is [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]] (def. \ref{CompactSigma}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to produce a [[countable cover]] of $X$ by [[compact subspaces]].

By [[second-countable topological space|second-countability]] there exists a [[countable set|countable]] [[base for a topology|base]] of open subsets

$$
  \beta
    =
  \left\{
    B_i \subset X
  \right\}_{i \in I}
  \,.
$$

By [[locally compact topological space|local compactness]], every point $x \in X$ has an open neighbourhood $V_x$ whose [[topological closure]] $Cl(V_x)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]].

By definition of [[base of a topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}),
for each $x \in X$ there exists $B_x \in \beta$ such that ${x} \subset B_x \subset V_x$,
hence such that $Cl(B_x) \subset Cl(V_x)$.

Since [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] (lemma \ref{SubsetsInClosedSubspace}),
since $Cl(V_x)$ is compact by assumption,
and since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}) it
follows that $B_x$ is compact.

Applying this for each point exhibits $X$ as a union of compact closures of base opens:

$$
  X = \underset{x \in X}{\cup} Cl(B_x)
  \,.
$$

But since there is only a [[countable set]] $\beta$ of base open subsets to begin with, there is a countable subset $J \subset X$ such that

$$
  X = \underset{x \in J}{\cup} Cl(B_x)
  \,.
$$

Hence

$$
  \{Cl(B_x) \subset X\}_{x \in J}
$$

is a countable cover of $X$ by compact subspaces.

The other two statements need a little more preparation:

**([[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] and [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]] space admits nested countable cover by coompact subspaces)**

1. [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace});

1. [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]] (def. \ref{CompactSigma}).

Then there exists a [[countable open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $X$ such that for each $i \in I$

1. the [[topological closure]] $Cl(U_i)$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspace]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}, example \ref{SubspaceTopology});

1. $Cl(U_i) \subset U_{i +1}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compactness]] of $X$ there exists a [[countable cover]] $\{K_i \subset X\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspaces]]. We use these to construct the required cover by [[induction]].

For $i = 0$ set

$$
  U_0 \coloneqq \emptyset
  \,.
$$

Then assume that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have constructed a set $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}$ with the required properties.

In particular this implies that the union

$$
  Q_n \coloneqq Cl(U_n) \cup K_{n-1} \;\subset X
$$

is a compact subspace (by example \ref{UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces}). We now construct an open neighbourhood $U_{n+1}$ of this union as follows:

Let $\{U_x \subset X\}_{x \in Q_n}$ be a set of open neighbourhood around each of the points in $Q_n$. By [[locally compact topological space|local compactness]] of $X$, for each $x$ there is a smaller open neighbourhood $V_x$ with

$$
  \{x\} \subset V_x \subset \underset{\text{compact}}{\Cl(V_x)} \subset U_x
  \,.
$$

So $\{V_x \subset X\}_{x \in Q_n}$ is still an open cover of $Q_n$. By compactness of $Q_n$,  there exists a [[finite set]] $J_n \subset Q_n$ such that $\{V_x \subset X\}_{x \in J_n}$ is a [[finite open cover]]. The union

$$
  U_{n + 1} \coloneqq \underset{x \in J_n}{\cup} V_x
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $Q_n$, hence in particular of $Cl(U_n)$. Moreover, since finite unions of compact
spaces are compact (example \ref{UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces}),
and since the closure of a finite union is the union of the closures (prop. \ref{ClosureOfAFiniteUnionIsUnionOfTheClosures})
the closure of $U_{n+1}$ is compact:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Cl(U_{n+1})
    &=
    Cl\left(  \underset{x\in J_n}{\cup} V_x \right)
    \\
    & =
    \underset{x \in J_n}{\cup} \underset{\text{compact}}{Cl( V_x )}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

In conclusion, by [[induction]] we have produced  a set $\{U_n \subset X\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $Cl(U_i)$ compact and $Cl(U_i) \subset U_{i+1}$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$. It remains to see that this is a cover. This follows since by construction each $U_{n+1}$ is an open neighbourhood not just of $Cl(U_{n})$ but in fact of $Q_n$, hence in particular of $K_n$, and since the $K_n$ form a cover by assumption:

$$
  \underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} U_i
  \supset
  \underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} K_i

**([[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]].

Then $X$ is also [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $X$. We need to show that this has a refinement by a [[locally finite cover]].

By lemma \ref{LocallyCompactAndSigmaCompactImpliesGoodNestedCover} there exists a countable open cover $\{V_n \subset X\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $X$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

1. $Cl(V_n)$ is compact;

1. $Cl(V_n) \subset V_{n+1}$.

Notice that the [[complement]] $Cl(V_{n+1}) \setminus V_n$ is compact, since $Cl(V_{n+1})$ is compact and $V_n$ is open,
by example \ref{IntersectionCompactWithOpen}.

By this compactness, the cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ regarded as a cover of the [[subspace]] $Cl(V_{n+1})\setminus V_n$ has a finite subcover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J_n}$ indexed by a finite set $J_n \subset I$, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

We consider the sets of intersections

$$
  \mathcal{U}_n
    \coloneqq
  \{ U_i \cap ( V_{n+2} \setminus Cl(V_{n-1}) )  \}_{i \in I}_{i \in J_n}
  \,.
$$

Since $V_{n+2} \setminus Cl(V_{n-1})$ is open, and since $Cl(V_{n+1}) \subset V_{n+2}$ by construction, this $\mathcal{U}_n$ is still an open cover of $Cl(V_{n+1})\setminus V_n$. We claim now that

$$
  \mathcal{U} \coloneqq \underset{n\in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} \mathcal{U}_n
$$

is a locally finite refinement of the original cover, as required:

1. $\mathcal{U}$ is a refinement, since by construction each element in $\mathcal{U}_n$ is contained in one of the $U_i$;

1. $\mathcal{U}$ is still a covering because by construction it covers $Cl(V_{n+1}) \setminus V_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and since by the nested nature of the cover $\{V_n \subset X\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ also  $\{Cl(V_{n+1}) \setminus V_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a cover of $X$.

1. $\mathcal{U}$ is locally finite because each point $x \in X$ has an open neighbourhood of the form $V_{n+2} \setminus Cl(V_{n-1})$ (since these also form an open cover, by the nestedness) and since by construction this has trivial intersection with $\mathcal{U}_{\geq n+3}$ and since all $\mathcal{U}_n$ are finite, so that also $\underset{k \lt n+3}{\cup} \mathcal{U}_k$ is finite.

More generally all [[metric spaces]] are paracompact. This we consider below as prop. \ref{ParacompactMetricSpace}.



Using this recognition principle prop. \ref{ParacompactFromLocallyCompactAndSigmacompact}, a source of paracompact
spaces are locally compact [[topological groups]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup}),

###### Definition
**([[topological group]])**

A [[topological group]] is a [[group]] $G$ equipped with a [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_G \subset P(G)$ (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace})
such that the group operation $ (-)\cdot (-)\;\colon\;G \times G \to G$ and the assignment of [[inverse elements]] $(-)^{-1} : G \to G$
are [[continuous functions]].

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example
**([[Euclidean space]] as a [[topological groups]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]]
and
equipped with the addition operation from its canonical [[vector space]] structure
is a [[topological group]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup}) $(\mathbb{R}^n, +)$.

The following prop. \ref{ParacompactLocallyCompactTopologicalGroups} is a useful recognition principle for paracompact topological groups:

###### Lemma
**(open subgroups of topological groups are closed)**

Every [[open subset|open]] [[subgroup]] $H \subset G$ of a [[topological group]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup}) is [[closed subset|closed]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The set of $H$-[[cosets]] is a [[cover]] of $G$ by [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] [[open subsets]].
One of these cosets is $H$ itself and hence it is the complement of the union of the other cosets, hence the complement of an open subspace, hence closed.

+-- {: .num_prop #ParacompactLocallyCompactTopologicalGroups}
###### Proposition
**([[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[topological groups]] are [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]])

A [[topological group]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup}) which is  [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] (def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}) is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] (def. \ref{ParacompactSpace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption of local compactness, there exists a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[neighbourhood]] $C_e \subset G$ of the [[neutral element]]. We may assume without restriction of generality that with $g \in C_e$ any element, then also the [[inverse element]] $g^{-1} \in C_e$.

For if this is not the case, then we may enlarge $C_e$ by including its inverse elements, and the result is still a compact neighbourhood of the neutral element: Since taking [[inverse elements]] $(-)^{-1} \colon G \to G$ is a [[continuous function]], and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]], it follows that also the set of inverse elements to elements in $C_e$ is compact, and the union of two compact subspaces is still compact (example \ref{UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces}).

Now for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write $C_e^n  \subset G$ for the [[image]] of $\underset{k \in \{1, \cdots n\}}{\prod} C_e \subset \underset{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} G$ under the iterated group product operation $\underset{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod} G \longrightarrow G$.

Then

$$
  H \coloneqq \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} C_e^n
    \;\subset\;
  G
$$

is clearly a topological subgroup of $G$.

Observe that each $C_e^n$ is compact. This is because $\underset{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}{\prod}C_e$ is
compact by the [[Tychonoff theorem]] (prop. \ref{TychonoffTheorem}), and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]]. Thus

$$
  H = \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} C_e^n
$$

is a countable union of compact subspaces, making it [[sigma-compact]].
Since [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]] (prop. \ref{ParacompactFromLocallyCompactAndSigmacompact}), this implies that $H$ is paracompact.

Observe also that the subgroup $H$ is open, because it contains with the [[interior]] of $C_e$ a non-empty open subset $Int(C_e) \subset H$ and we may hence write $H$ as a union of open subsets

$$
  H = \underset{h \in H}{\cup} Int(C_e) \cdot h
  \,.
$$

Finally, as indicated in the proof of Lemma \ref{OpenSubgroupOfTopologicalGroupIsClosed}, the cosets of the open subgroup $H$ are all open and partition $G$ as a [[disjoint union space]] (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}) of these open cosets. From this we may draw the following conclusions:

* In the particular case where $G$ is [[connected topological space|connected]] (def. \ref{ConnectedTopologicalSpace}), there is just one such coset, namely $H$ itself. The argument above thus shows that a connected locally compact topological group is $\sigma$-compact and (by local compactness) also paracompact.

* In the general case, all the cosets are homeomorphic to $H$ which we have just shown to be a paracompact group. Thus $G$ is a [[disjoint union space]] of paracompact spaces. This is again paracompact by prop. \ref{ParacompactDisjointUnionOfParacompactSpaces}.

=--

An archetypical example of a locally compact topological group is the general linear group:

+-- {: .num_example #GLn}
###### Example
**([[general linear group]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the _[[general linear group]]_ $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ is the [[group]] of [[real number|real]] $n \times n$ [[matrices]] whose [[determinant]] is non-vanishing

   $$
     GL(n)
     \;\coloneqq\;
     \left(
       A \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R})
       \; \vert \;
       det(A) \neq 0
     \right)
   $$

   with group operation given by [[matrix multiplication]].

   This becomes a [[topological group]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup})
   by taking the [[topological space|topology]] on $GL_(n,\mathbb{R})$ to be the
   [[subspace topology]] (def. \ref{SubspaceTopology}) as a subspace of the [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) of [[matrices]]

   $$
     GL(n,\mathbb{R})\subset  Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}
   $$

   with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

   Since [[matrix multiplication]] is a
   [[polynomial function]] and since [[inverse matrix|matrix inversion]] is a [[rational function]],
   and since [[polynomials are continuous]] and more generally [[rational functions are continuous]] on their [[domain]] of definition
   (example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}) and since the domain of definition for matrix inversion is precisely
   $GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R})$, the group operations on $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ are indeed
   [[continuous functions]].

=--

There is another [[topological space|topology]] which suggests itself on the general linear group:
the [[compact-open topology]] (example \ref{CompactOpenTopology}). But in fact this coincides with
the Euclidean topology:

+-- {: .num_example #AsSubspaceOfTheMappingSpace}
###### Proposition
**([[general linear group]] is [[subspace]] of the [[compact-open topology|mapping space]])

The [[topological space|topology]] induced on the real general linear group when regarded as a [[topological subspace]] of [[Euclidean space]] with its [[metric topology]]

$$
  GL(n,\mathbb{R})
    \subset
  Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R})
    \simeq
  \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}
$$

(as in def. \ref{GLn})
coincides with the topology induced by regarding the general linear group as a [[subspace]] of the [[mapping space]] $Maps(k^n, k^n)$,

$$
  GL(n,\mathbb{R})
    \subset
  Maps(k^n, k^n)
$$

i.e. the set of all [[continuous functions]] $k^n \to k^n$ equipped with the [[compact-open topology]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

On the one had, the [[universal property]] of the [[mapping space]] ([this prop.](Introduction+to+Topology+--+1#UniversalPropertyOfMappingSpace)) gives that the inclusion

$$
  GL(n, \mathbb{R}) \to Maps(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}^n)
$$

is a [[continuous function]] for $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ equipped with the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]], because this is the [[adjunct]] of the defining continuous [[action]] map

$$
  GL(n, \mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$


This implies that the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] on $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is equal to or [[finer topology|finer]] than the subspace topology coming from $Map(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}^n)$.

We conclude by showing that it is also equal to or [[coarser topology|coarser]], together this then implies the claims.

Since we are speaking about a subspace topology, we may consider the open subsets of the ambient Euclidean space $Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}$. Observe that a [[neighborhood base]] of a linear map or matrix $A$ consists of sets of the form

$$
  U_A^\epsilon
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{B \in Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \,\vert\, \underset{{1 \leq i \leq n}}{\forall}\; |A e_i - B e_i| \lt \epsilon \right\}
$$

for $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$.

But this is also a [[base for the topology|base]] element for the [[compact-open topology]], namely

$$
  U_A^\epsilon
   \;=\;
  \bigcap_{i = 1}^n V_i^{K_i}
  \,,
$$

where $K_i \coloneqq \{e_i\}$ is a [[singleton]] and $V_i \coloneqq B^\circ_{A e^i}(\epsilon)$ is the [[open ball]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $A e^i$.

###### Proposition
**([[general linear group]] is [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space|paracompact Hausdorff]])**

The [[topological group|topological]] [[general linear group]] $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ (def. \ref{GLn}) is

1. not [[compact topological space|compact]];

1. [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]];

1. [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space|paracompact Hausdorff]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that

$$
  GL_n(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}
$$

is an [[open subset|open]] [[subspace]], since it is the [[pre-image]] under the [[determinant]] function (which is a [[polynomial]] and hence continuous, example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}) of the of the open subspace $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \subset \mathbb{R}$:

$$
  GL(n,\mathbb{R}) = det^{-1}( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} )
  \,.
$$

As an open subspace of Euclidean space, $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is not compact, by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] (prop. \ref{BorelHeine}).

As Euclidean space is Hausdorff (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}), and since every [[topological subspace]] of a Hausdorff space is again Hausdorff, so $Gl(n,\mathbb{R})$ is Hausdorff.

Similarly, as Euclidean space is [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] (example \ref{MetricSpacesAreLocallyCompact}) and since
an open subspace of a locally compact space is again locally compact, it follows that $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is locally compact.

From this it follows that $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is paracompact, since locally compact topological groups are paracompact
by prop. \ref{ParacompactLocallyCompactTopologicalGroups}.

Now we turn to the second recognition principle for paracompactness and the examples it implies.

**([[metric spaces are paracompact]])**

A [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) regarded as a [[topological space]] via its

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover. By [[Michael's theorem]] (prop. \ref{RegularSpacesWherOpenCoveringIsRefinedbyCountableLocallyFiniteConnectionsofOpensAreParacompact}) it is sufficient that we find a [[refinement]] by a [[countable cover]].

But second countability implies precisely that every open cover has a countable subcover:

Every open cover has a refinement by a cover consisting of [[base for the topology|base]] elements, and if there is only a countable set of these, then the resulting refinement necessarily contains at most this countable set of distinct open subsets.

###### Example
**([[CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]], let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let

  f \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \longrightarrow X
$$

be a [[continuous function]] from the $(n-1)$-[[sphere]] (with its [[subspace topology]] inherited from [[Euclidean space]],

    D^n &\underset{i_{D^n}}{\longrightarrow}& X \cup_f D^n

$$

is paracompact Hausdorff.

This immediately implies that all [[finite CW-complexes]] (def. \ref{RelativeCellComplexes}) relative to a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]]
are themselves paracompact Hausdorff. In fact this is true generally: all CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces.

### Partitions of unity
 {#PartitionsOfUnity}

A key aspect of paracompact Hausdorff spaces is that they are equivalently those spaces that admit
_partitions of unity_. This is  def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity} and prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffEquivalentToexistenceOfParititionsOfUnity}
below. The existence of partitions of unity on topological spaces is what starts to give them
"[[geometry|geometric]] character". For instance the [[topological vector bundles]] discussed [below](#VectorBundles)
behave as expected in the presence of partitions of unity.

$\,$

Before we discuss partitions of unity, we consider some technical preliminaries
on locally finite covers. First of all notice the following simple but useful fact:

+-- {: .num_lemma #LocallyFiniteRefinementInducesLocallyFiniteWithSameIndexSet}
###### Lemma
**(every locally finite refinement induces one with the original index set)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] (def. \ref{OpenCover}), and let $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$, be a [[refinement]] (def. \ref{RefinementOfOpenCovers}) to a [[locally finite cover]] (def. \ref{LocallyFiniteCover}).

By definition of [[refinement]] we may [[axiom of choice|choose]] a [[function]]

$$
  \phi \colon J \to I
$$

such that

$$
  \underset{j \in J}{\forall}\left( V_j \subset U_{\phi(j)} \right)
  \,.
$$

Then  $\left\{ W_i \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ with

$$
  W_i
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    \underset{j \in \phi^{-1}(\{i\})}{\cup} V_j
  \right\}
$$

is still a [[refinement]] of $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ to a [[locally finite cover]].

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear by construction that $W_i \subset U_i$, hence that we have a [[refinement]]. We need to show local finiteness.

Hence consider $x \in X$. By the assumption that $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ is locally finite, it follows that there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $K \subset J$ such that

$$
  \underset{j \in J\setminus K}{\forall} \left( U_x \cap V_j = \emptyset \right)
  \,.
$$

Hence by construction

$$
  \underset{i \in I\setminus \phi(K)}{\forall} \left( U_x \cap W_i = \emptyset \right)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[image]] $\phi(K) \subset I$ is still a [[finite set]], this shows that $\{W_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is locally finite.

In the discussion of [[topological manifolds]] [below](#Manifolds), we are particularly
interested in topological spaces that are both paracompact as well as Hausdorff.
In fact these are even normal:

+-- {: .num_prop #ParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal}
###### Proposition
**([[paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal]])**

Every [[paracompact Hausdorff space]]
(def. \ref{ParacompactSpace}, def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) is [[normal Hausdorff space|normal]] (def. \ref{NormalSpace}).

In particular [[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a paracompact Hausdorff space

We first show that it is [[regular topological space|regular]]: To that end,
let $x \in X$ be a point, and let $C \subset X$ be a [[closed subset]] not containing $x$. We need to find disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_C \supset C$.

First of all, by the Hausdorff property there exists for each $c \in C$ disjoint open neighbourhods $U_{x,c} \supset \{x\}$ and $U_c \supset \{c\}$. As $c$ ranges, the latter clearly form an open cover $\{U_c \subset X\}_{c \in C}$ of $C$, and so the union

$$
  \{U_c \subset X\}_{c \in C} \,\cup\, X \setminus C
$$

is an open cover of $X$. By paracompactness of $(X,\tau)$, there exists a locally finite refinement, and by
lemma \ref{LocallyFiniteRefinementInducesLocallyFiniteWithSameIndexSet} we may assume its elements to share the original index
set and be contained in the original elements of the same index. Hence

$$
  \{V_c \subset U_c \subset  X\}_{c \in C}
$$

is a locally finite collection of subsets, such that

$$
  U_C \coloneqq \underset{c \in C}{\cup} V_c
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $C$.


Now by definition of local finiteness there exists an open neighbourhood $W_x \supset \{x\}$ and a finite subset $K \subset C$ such that

$$
  \underset{c \in C \setminus K}{\forall}( W_x \cap V_c = \emptyset )
  \,.
$$

Consider then

$$
  U_x
   \;\coloneqq\;
  W_x
    \cap
  \left(
    \underset{k \in K}{\cap}
     \left(
       U_{x,k}
     \right)
  \right)
  \,,
$$

which is an open neighbourhood of $x$, by the finiteness of $K$.

It thus only remains to see that

$$
  U_x \cap U_C = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

But this holds because the only $V_{c}$ that intersect $W_x$ are the $V_{k} \subset U_{k}$ for $k \in K$ and each of these is by construction disjoint from $U_{x,k}$ and hence from $U_x$.

This establishes that $(X,\tau)$ is regular. Now we prove that it is normal. For this we use the same approach as before:

Let $C,D \subset X$ be two disjoint closed subsets. By need to produce disjoint open neighbourhoods for these.

By the previous statement of regularity, we may find for each $c \in C$ disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_c \subset \{c\}$ and $U_{D,c} \supset D$. Hence the union

$$
  \left\{
    U_c \subset X
  \right\}_{c \in C}
  \cup
  X \setminus C
$$

is an open cover of $X$, and thus by paracompactness has a locally finite refinement, whose elementes we may, again by lemma \ref{LocallyFiniteRefinementInducesLocallyFiniteWithSameIndexSet}, assume to have the same index set as before and be contained in the previous elements with the same index. Hence we obtain a locally finite collection of subsets

$$
  \{ V_c \subset U_c \subset X \}_{c \in C}
$$

such that

$$
  U_{C}
   \coloneqq
  \underset{c \in C}{\cup} V_c
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $C$.

It is now sufficient to see that every point $d \in D$ has an open neighbourhood $U_d$ not intersecting $U_C$, for then

$$
  U_D \coloneqq \underset{d \in D}{\cup} U_d
$$

is the required open neighbourhood of $D$ not intersecting $U_C$.

Now by local finiteness of $\{V_c \subset X\}_{c \in X}$, every $d \in D$ has an open neighbourhood $W_d$ such that there is a finite set $K_d \subset C$ so that

$$
  \underset{c \in C \setminus K_d}{\forall}
  \left(
     V_c \cap W_d = \emptyset
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Accordingly the intersection

$$
  U_d
    \coloneqq
  W_d
   \cap
  \left(
    \underset{c \in K_d \subset C}{\cap} U_{D,c}
  \right)
$$

is still open and disjoint from the remaining $V_k$, hence disjoint from all of $U_C$.

That paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal (prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal}) allows to "shrink" the open subsets of any
locally finite open cover a little, such that the topological closure of the small patch is still contained in the original one:

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[normal topological space|normal]] (def. \ref{NormalSpace}) and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[open cover]] (def. \ref{LocallyFiniteCover}).

Then there exists another open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ such that the [[topological closure]] $Cl(V_i)$ of its elements is contained in the original patches:

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]] and let $\{U \subset X\}_{i \in \{1,2\}}$ an [[open cover]] by two [[open subsets]].

Then there exists an open set $V_1 \subset X$ whose [[topological closure]] is contained in $U_1$

$$
  V_1 \subset Cl(V_1) \subset U_1
$$

and such that $\{V_1,U_2\}$ is still an open cover of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $U_1 \cup U_2 = X$ it follows (by [[de Morgan's law]], prop. \ref{deMorgan}) that their [[complements]] $X \setminus U_i$ are [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[closed subsets]]. Hence by normality of $(X,\tau)$ there exist disjoint open subsets

$$
  V_1 \supset X \setminus U_2
  \phantom{AAA}
  V_2 \supset X \setminus U_1
  \,.
$$

By their disjointness, we have the following inclusions:

$$
  V_1 \subset X \setminus V_2 \subset U_1
  \,.
$$

In particular, since $X \setminus V_2$ is closed, this means that $Cl(V_1) \subset Cl(X \setminus V_2) =  X \setminus V_2 $.

Hence it only remains to observe that $V_1 \cup U_2 = X$, which is true     by definition of $V_1$.

Then there exists another open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ such that $Cl(V_i) \subset U_i$ for all $i \in I$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[induction]], using lemma \ref{ShrinkingLemmaForBinaryCover}.

To begin with, consider $\{ U_1, \underoverset{i = 2}{n}{\cup} U_i\}$. This is a binary open cover, and hence lemma \ref{ShrinkingLemmaForBinaryCover} gives an open subset $V_1 \subset X$ with $V_1 \subset Cl(V_1) \subset U_1$ such that $\{V_1, \underoverset{i = 2}{n}{\cup} U_i\}$ is still an open cover, and accordingly so is

$$
  \{ V_1  \} \cup \left\{ U_i \right\}_{i \in \{2, \cdots, n\}}
  \,.
$$

Similarly we next find an open subset $V_2 \subset X$ with $V_2 \subset Cl(V_2) \subset U_2$ and such that

$$
  \{ V_1, ,V_2  \} \cup \left\{ U_i \right\}_{i \in \{3, \cdots, n\}}
$$

is an open cover. After $n$ such steps we are left with an open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}$ as required.

###### Remark

Beware the [[induction]] in lemma \ref{ShrinkinglemmaForFiniteCovers} does _not_ give the statement for infinite [[countable covers]]. The issue is that it is not guaranteed that $\underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} V_i$ is a cover.

And in fact, assuming the [[axiom of choice]], then there exists a  counter-example of a countable cover on a normal spaces for which the shrinking lemma fails (a [[Dowker space]] due to [Beslagic 85](#Beslagic85)).

=--

This issue is evaded if we consider [[locally finite covers|locally finite]] countable covers:

###### Lemma
**([[shrinking lemma]] for locally finite countable covers)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]] and $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[countable cover]]. Then there exists [[open subsets]] $V_i \subset X$ for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $V_i \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i$ and such that $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is still a cover.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

As in the proof of lemma \ref{ShrinkinglemmaForFiniteCovers}, there exist $V_i$ for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $V_i \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i$ and such that for every finite number, hence every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then

$$
  \underoverset{i = 0}{n}{\cup} V_i
  \;=\;
  \underoverset{i = 0}{n}{\cup} U_i
  \,.
$$

Now the extra assumption that $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] implies that every $x \in X$ is contained in only finitely many of the  $U_i$, hence that for every $x \in X$ there exists $n_x \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$
  x \in \underoverset{i = 0}{n_x}{\cup} U_i
  \,.
$$

This implies that for every $x$ then

$$
  x \in \underoverset{i = 0}{n_x}{\cup} V_i
  \subset \underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} V_i
$$

hence that $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is indeed a cover of $X$.

=--

This is as far as one gets without the [[axiom of choice]].
We now invoke [[Zorn's lemma]] to generalize the shrinking lemma for finitely many patches (lemma \ref{ShrinkinglemmaForFiniteCovers}) to arbitrary sets of patches:

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
of the general [[shrinking lemma]], lemma \ref{PatchesOfOpenCoverOfNormalSpaceMayBeMadeSmallerSoThatTheirClosuresAreContained}.

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be the given locally finite cover of the normal space $(X,\tau)$. Consider the set $S$ of [[pairs]] $(J, \mathcal{V})$ consisting of

1. a [[subset]] $J \subset I$;

1. an $I$-indexed set of open subsets $\mathcal{V} = \{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$

with the property that

1. $(i \in J \subset I) \Rightarrow ( Cl(V_i) \subset U_i )$;

1. $(i \in I \setminus J) \Rightarrow ( V_i = U_i )$.

1. $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $X$.

Equip the set $S$ with a [[partial order]] by setting

$$
  \left(
    (J_1, \mathcal{V})
    \leq
    (J_2, \mathcal{W})
  \right)
    \Leftrightarrow
  \left(
    \left(
      J_1 \subset J_2
    \right)
    \,\text{and}\,
    \left(
      \underset{i \in J_1}{\forall}
      \left(
         V_i = W_i
      \right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

By definition, an element of $S$ with $J = I$ is an open cover of the required form.

We claim now that a [[maximal element]] $(J, \mathcal{V})$ of $(S,\leq)$ has $J = I$.

For assume on the contrary that $(J,\mathcal{V})$ is maximal and there were $i \in I \setminus J$. Then we could apply the construction in lemma \ref{ShrinkingLemmaForBinaryCover} to replace that single $V_i$ with a smaller open subset $V'_i$ to obtain $\mathcal{V}'$ such that $Cl(V'_i) \subset V_i$ and such that $\mathcal{V}'$ is still an open cover. But that would mean that $(J,\mathcal{V}) \lt (J \cup \{i\}, \mathcal{V}')$, contradicting the assumption that $(J,\mathcal{V})$ is maximal. This [[proof by contradiction|proves by contradiction]] that a maximal element of $(S,\leq)$ has $J = I$ and hence is an open cover as required.

We are reduced now to showing that a maximal element of $(S,\leq)$ exists. To achieve this we invoke [[Zorn's lemma]]. Hence we have to check that every [[chain]] in $(S,\leq)$, hence every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] has an [[upper bound]].

So let $T \subset S$ be a [[total order|totally ordered]] subset. Consider the union of all the index sets appearing in the pairs in this subset:

$$
  K
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{(J,\mathcal{V}) \in T  }{\cup} J
  \,.
$$

Now define open subsets $W_i$ for $i \in K$ picking any $(J,\mathcal{V})$ in $T$ with $i \in J$ and setting

$$
  W_i \coloneqq V_i \phantom{AAA} i \in K
  \,.
$$

This is independent of the choice of $(J,\mathcal{V})$, hence well defined, by the assumption that $(T,\leq)$ is totally ordered.

Moreover, for $i \in I\setminus K$ define

$$
  W_i \coloneqq U_i  \phantom{AAA} i \in I \setminus K
  \,.
$$

We claim now that $\{W_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ thus defined is a cover of $X$. Because by assumption that $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is locally finite, so for every point $x \in X$ there exists a finite set $J_x \subset I$ such that $(i \in I \setminus J_x) \Rightarrow (x \notin U_i)$. Since $(T,\leq)$ is a total order, it must contain an element $(J, \mathcal{V})$ such that
the finite set $J_x \cap K$ is contained in its index set $J$, hence  $J_x \cap K \subset J$. Since that $\mathcal{V}$ is a cover, it follows that $x \in \underset{i \in J_x \cap K}{V_i} \subset  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} V_i$, hence in $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} W_i$.

This shows that $(K,\mathcal{W})$ is indeed an element of $S$. It is clear by construction that it is an upper bound for $(T ,\leq )$. Hence we have shown that every [[chain]] in $(S,\leq)$ has an upper bound, and so Zorn's lemma implies the claim.

After these preliminaries, we finally turn to the partitions of unity:

+-- {: .num_defn #PartitionOfUnity}
###### Definition
**([[partition of unity]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]]. Then a _[[partition of unity]] subordinate to the cover_ is

* a [[set]] $\{f_i\}_{i \in I}$ of [[continuous functions]]

  $$
    f_i \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow [0,1]
  $$

  (where  $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ is equipped with the [[subspace topology]] of the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] equipped with its [[metric topology]]);

such that with

$$
  Supp(f_i) \coloneqq Cl\left( f_i^{-1}( (0,1] ) \right)
$$

denoting the [[support]] of $f_i$ (the [[topological closure]] of the subset of points on which it does not vanish) then

1. $\underset{i \in I}{\forall} \left( Supp(f_i) \subset U_i \right)$;

1. $\left\{ Supp(f_i) \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$  is a [[locally finite cover]] (def. \ref{LocallyFiniteCover});

1. $\underset{x \in X}{\forall} \left(  \underset{i \in I}{\sum} f_i(x) = 1 \right)$.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #RemarkPartitionOfUnity}
###### Remark

Regarding the definition of [[partition of unity]] (def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}) observe that:

1. Due to the second clause in def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}, the [[sum]] in the third clause involves only a [[finite number]] of elements not equal to zero, and therefore is well defined.

1. Due to the third clause, the interiors of the supports $\left \{ h_i^{-1}( (0,1] ) \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$
   constitute a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[open cover]]:

   1. they are open, since they are the [[pre-images]] under the [[continuous functions]] $f_i$ of the open subset $(0,1] \subset [0,1]$,

   1. they cover because, by the third clause, for each $x \in x$ there is at least one $i \in I$ with $h_i(X) \gt 0$,
      hence $x \in h_i^{-1}((0,1])$

   1. they are locally finite because by the second clause alreay their closures are locally finite.

###### Example

Consider $\mathbb{R}$ with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]].

Then a [[partition of unity]] $\{ f_n \colon \mathbb{R} \to [0,1] \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  (def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity})) subordinate to this cover is given by

###### Proposition
**([[paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}). Then the following are equivalent:

1. $(X,\tau)$ is a [[paracompact topological space]] (def. \ref{ParacompactSpace}).

1. Every [[open cover]] of $(X,\tau)$ admits a subordinate [[partition of unity]] (def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}).

=--


+-- {: .proof #OpenCoverOfParacompactHausdorffSpaceAdmitsPartitionOfUnityProof}
###### Proof

One direction is immediate: Assume that every open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ admits a subordinate partition of unity $\{f_i\}_{i \in I}$. Then by definition (def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}) $\{ Int(Supp(f)_i)  \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is a locally finite open cover refining the original one (remark \ref{RemarkPartitionOfUnity}), hence $X$ is paracompact.

We need to show the converse: If $(X,\tau)$ is a [[paracompact topological space]], then for every [[open cover]] there is a subordinate [[partition of unity]] (def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}).

By paracompactness of $(X,\tau)$, for every open cover there exists a locally finite refinement
$\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$, and by lemma \ref{LocallyFiniteRefinementInducesLocallyFiniteWithSameIndexSet} we
may assume that this has the same index set. It is now sufficient to show that this locally finite cover
$\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ admits a subordinate partition of unity, since this will then also be
subordinate to the original cover.

Since [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal]]
(prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal})
we may apply the [[shrinking lemma]] \ref{PatchesOfOpenCoverOfNormalSpaceMayBeMadeSmallerSoThatTheirClosuresAreContained} to the given locally finite open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}$, to obtain a smaller locally finite open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$. Apply the lemma once more to that result to get a yet smaller open cover  $\{W_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$, so that now

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\forall}
  \left(
     W_i \subset Cl(W_i) \subset V_i \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$

It follows that for each $i \in I$ we have two disjoint [[closed subsets]], namely the [[topological closure]] $Cl(W_i)$ and the [[complement]] $X \setminus V_i$

$$
  Cl(W_i) \cap (X\setminus V_i) = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

Now since [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal]] (prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal}), [[Urysohn's lemma]] (prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma}) says that there exist [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  h_i \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow [0,1]
$$

with the property that

$$
  h_i( Cl(W_i) ) = \{1\}
  \,,
  \phantom{AAA}
  h_i( X \setminus V_i ) = \{0\}
  \,.
$$

This means in particular that $h_i^{-1}((0,1]) \subset V_i$ and hence that the [[support]] of the function is
contained in $U_i$

$$
  Supp(h_i) =  Cl(h_i^{-1}((0,1])) \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i
  \,.
$$

By this construction, the set of function $\{h_i\}_{i \in I}$ already
satisfies conditions 1) and 2) on a partition of unity subordinate to $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ from def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}.
It just remains to normalize these functions so that they indeed sum to unity. To that end, consider the continuous function

$$
  h \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow [0,1]
$$

defined on $x \in X$ by

$$
  h(x) \coloneqq \underset{i \in I}{\sum} h_i(x)
  \,.
$$

Notice that the [[sum]] on the right has only a [[finite number]] of non-zero summands, due to the local finiteness of the cover, so that this is well-defined. Moreover this is again a continuous function, since [[polynomials are continuous]] (example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}).



Moreover, notice that

$$
  \underset{x \in X}{\forall} \left(  h(x) \neq 0  \right)
$$

because $\{Cl(W_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is a cover so that there is $i_x \in I$ with $x \in Cl(W_{i_x})$, and since $h_i(Cl(W_{i_x})) = \{1\}$, by the above, and since all contributions to the sum are non-negative.

Hence it makes sense to define the [[ratios]]

$$
  f_i \;\coloneqq\;  h_i/h
  \,.
$$

Since $Supp(f_i) = Supp(h_i)$ this still satisfies conditions 1) and 2) on a partition of unity
(def. \ref{PartitionOfUnity}), but by construction this now also satisfies

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\sum} f_i = 1
$$

and hence the remaining condition 3). Therefore

$$
  \left\{
     f_i
  \right\}_{i \in I}
$$

is a partition of unity as required.

We will see various applications of prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffEquivalentToexistenceOfParititionsOfUnity}
in the discussion of [topological vector bundles](#VectorBundles) and of [topological manifolds](#Manifolds),
to which we now turn.


$\,$

## Vector bundles
 {#VectorBundles}

A _([[topological vector bundle|topological]]) [[vector bundle]]_ is a collection of [[vector spaces]]
that vary continuously over a [[topological space]]. Hence topological vector bundles combine
[[linear algebra]] with [[topology]]. The usual operations of [[linear algebra]], such as
[[direct sum]] and [[tensor product of vector spaces]], generalize to "parameterized" such
operations $\oplus_X$ and $\otimes_X$ on vector bundles over some base space $X$ (def. \ref{DirectSumOfTopologicalVectorBundlesViaTransitionFunctions} and def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorBundles} below).

This way a [[semi-ring]] $(Vect(X)_{/\sim}, \oplus_X, \otimes_X)$ of isomorphism classes of
topological vector bundles is associated with every [[topological space]]. If one adds in formal additive
inverses to this semiring (passing to the [[Grothendieck group of a commutative monoid|group completion]] of the direct sum of vector bundles) one obtains
an actual ring, called the _[[topological K-theory]]_ $K(X)$ of the topological space. This is a fundamental
topological invariant that plays a central role in [[algebraic topology]].

A key class of examples of topological vector bundles are the _[[tangent bundles]]_ of [[differentiable manifolds]]
to which we turn [below](#Manifolds). For these the vector space associated with every point is the
"linear approximation" of the base space at that point.

Topological vector bundles are particularly well behaved over [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces]],
where the existence of [[partitions of unity]] (by prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffEquivalentToexistenceOfParititionsOfUnity} above) allows to perform global operations on vector bundles by first performing them locally and then using the partition of unity
to continuously interpolate between these local constructions. This is one reason why the definition of
[[topological manifolds]] [below](#Manifolds) demands them to be paracompact Hausdorff spaces.

$\,$

The combination of [[topology]] with [[linear algebra]] begins in the evident way,
in the same vein as the concept of [[topological groups]] (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup});
we "[[internalization|internalize]]" definitions from [[linear algebra]] into
the [[cartesian monoidal category]] [[Top]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}, remark \ref{CartesianSymmetricMonoidalTop}):

**([[topological ring]] and [[topological field]])

A _[[topological ring]]_ is

1. a [[ring]] $(R,+,\cdot)$,

1. a [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_R \subset P(R)$ on the underlying set of the ring, making it
   a [[topological space]] $(R,\tau_R)$ (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace})

such that

1. $(R,+)$ is a [[topological group]] with respect to $\tau_R$ (def. \ref{TopologicalGroup});

1. also the multiplication $(-)\cdot (-) \;\colon\; R \times R \longrightarrow R$ is a [[continuous function]]
   with respect to $\tau_R$ and the [[product topology]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}).

A topological ring $((R, \tau_R),+,\cdot)$ is a _[[topological field]]_ if

1. $(R,+,\cdot)$ is a [[field]];

1. the function assigning multiplicative inverses $(-)^{-1} \;\colon\; R \setminus \{0\} \to R \setminus \{0\}$ is a

Let $[E_1 \to X]$ and $[E_2 \to X]$ be two topological vector bundles (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}).
Then there always exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ such that both bundles
have a [[local trivialization]] over this cover.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition we may find two possibly different
open covers $\{U^1_{i_1} \subset X\}_{{i_1} \in I_1}$ and $\{U^2_{i_2} \subset X\}_{i_2 \in I_2}$
with local tivializations
$\{ U^1_{i_1} \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_{i_1}}{\to} E_1\vert_{U^1_{i_1}} \}_{i_1 \in I_1}$
and
$\{ U^2_{i_2} \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^2_{i_2}}{\to} E_2\vert_{U^2_{i_2}} \}_{i_2 \in I_2}$.

The _joint [[refinement]]_ of these two covers is the open cover given by the intersections
of the original patches:

$$
  \left\{
    U_{i_1, i_2}
      \coloneqq
    U^1_{i_1} \cap U^2_{i_2}
      \subset
    X
  \right\}_{(i_1, i_2) \in I_1 \times I_2}
  \,.
$$

The original local trivializations restrict to local trivializations on this finer cover

$$
  \left\{
    U_{i_1, i_2}
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_{i_1}\vert_{U^2_{i_2}}}{\longrightarrow}
    E_1\vert_{U_{i_1, i_2}}
  \right\}_{(i_1, i_2) \in I_1 \times I_2}
$$

and

$$
  \left\{
    U_{i_1, i_2}
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^2_{i_2}\vert_{U^1_{i_1}}}{\longrightarrow}
    E_2\vert_{U_{i_1, i_2}}
  \right\}_{(i_1, i_2) \in I_1 \times I_2}
  \,.

###### Example
**(topological [[trivial vector bundle]] and (local) trivialization)**

For $X$ any [[topological space]], and $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
we have that the [[product topological space]]

$$
  X \times k^n \overset{pr_1}{\to} X
$$

canonically becomes a topological vector bundle over $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}).
A local trivialization is given over the trivial cover $\{X \subset X\}$ by the identity function $\phi$.

This is called the _[[trivial vector bundle]]_ of [[rank]] $n$ over $X$.

Given any topological vector bundle $E \to X$, then a choice of [[isomorphism]] to a trivial bundle (if it exists)

$$
  E \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow} X \times k^n
$$

is called a _trivialization_ of $E$. A vector bundle for which a trivialization exists is called _trivializable_.

Accordingly, the [[local trivialization|local triviality]] condition in the definition of topological vector bundles (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}) says that they are locally isomorphic to the trivial vector bundle. One also says that the data consisting of an open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ and the [[homeomorphisms]]

$$
  \left\{
     U_i \times k^n
       \overset{\simeq}{\to}
     E|_{U_i}
  \right\}_{i \in I}
$$

as in def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle} constitute a _[[local trivialization]]_ of $E$.

###### Example
**([[section]] of a [[topological vector bundle]])**

Let $E \overset{\pi}{\to} X$ be a topological vector bundle (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}).

Then a [[homomorphism]] of vector bundles from the [[trivial vector bundle|trivial]] [[line bundle]]
(example \ref{TrivialTopologicalVectorBundle}, remark \ref{TerminologyVectorBundles})

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \times k \longrightarrow E
$$

is, by fiberwise linearity, equivalently a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \sigma \;\colon\;  X \longrightarrow E
$$

such that $\pi \circ \sigma = id_X$

$$

    & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    X & \underset{id_X}{\longrightarrow} & X
  }
  \,.
$$

Such functions $\sigma \colon X \to E$ are called _[[sections]]_ (or _cross-sections_)
of the vector bundle $E$.

Namely $f$ by is necessarily of the form

$$
  f(x, c) = c \cdot \sigma(x)
$$

for a unique such section $\sigma$.

###### Example
**(topological vector sub-bundle)**

Given a topological vector bundel $E \to X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}), then a _sub-bundle_ is a homomorphism of topological vector bundles over $X$

$$
  i\;\colon\; E' \hookrightarrow E
$$

such that for each point $x \in X$ this is a linear embedding of fibers

$$
  i|_x \;\colon\; E'_x \hookrightarrow E_x

The archetypical example of vector bundles are the [[tautological line bundles]]
on [[projective spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #ToplogicalProjectiveSpace}
###### Definition
**(topological [[projective space]])**

Let $k$ be a [[topological field]] (def. \ref{TopologicalRing})
and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Consider the [[product topological space]] $k^{n+1} \coloneqq \underset{\{1,\cdots, n+1\}}{\prod} k$,
let $k^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \subset k^{n+1}$ be the [[topological subspace]] which is the [[complement]] of the origin, and consider on its underlying set the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies two points if they differ by [[multiplication]] with some $c \in k$ (necessarily non-zero):

$$
  (\vec x_1 \sim \vec x_2)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{c \in k}{\exists}
    ( \vec x_2 = c \vec x_1 )
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The [[equivalence class]] $[\vec x]$ is traditionally denoted

$$
  [x_1 : x_2 : \cdots : x_{n+1}]
  \,.
$$


Then the _[[projective space]]_ $k P^n$ is the corresponding [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  k P^n \;\coloneqq\; \left(k^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}\right) / \sim
  \,.
$$

For $k = \mathbb{R}$ this is called _[[real projective space]]_ $\mathbb{R}P^n$;

for $k = \mathbb{C}$ this is called _[[complex projective space]]_ $\mathbb{C}P^n$.

The first [[complex projective space]] (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace})

Under this identification one also speaks of the _[[Riemann sphere]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover}
###### Definition
**(standard open cover of topological [[projective space]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the _standard open cover_ of the projective space $k P^n$ (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace}) is

$$
  \left\{
    U_i \subset k P^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n+1\}}
$$

with

$$
  U_i

    [x_1 : \cdots : x_{n+1}] \in k P^n
    \;\vert\;
    x_i \neq 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

To see that this is an open cover:

1. This is a cover because with the orgin removed in $k^n \setminus \{0\}$ at every point $[x_1: \cdots : x_{n+1}]$
   at least one of the $x_i$ has to be non-vanishing.

1. These subsets are open in the [[quotient topology]] $kP^n = (k^n \setminus \{0\})/\sim$, since their [[pre-image]] under the quotient co-projection $k^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to k P^n$ coincides with the pre-image $pr_i^{-1}( k \setminus \{0\} )$ under the [[projection]] onto the $i$th coordinate in the [[product topological space]] $k^{n+1} = \underset{i \in \{1,\cdots, n+1\}}{\prod} k$.

###### Definition
**(topological [[tautological line bundle]])

For $k$ a [[topological field]] (def. \ref{TopologicalRing}) and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the _tautological line bundle_ over the [[projective space]] $k P^n$ is topological $k$-[[line bundle]] (remark \ref{TerminologyVectorBundles})
whose total space is the following [[subspace]] of the [[product space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})
of the [[projective space]] $k P^n$ (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace}) with $k^n$:

$$
  T

$$

where $\langle \vec x\rangle_k \subset k^{n+1}$ is the $k$-[[linear span]] of $\vec x$.

(The space $T$ is the space of pairs consisting of the "name" of a $k$-line in $k^{n+1}$ together with an element of that $k$-line)

This is a bundle over [[projective space]] by the projection function

$$
  \array{
    T &\overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow}& k P^n

+-- {: .num_prop #WellDefinedTautologicalTopologicalLineBundle}
###### Proposition
**(tautological topological line bundle is well defined)**

The tautological line bundle in def. \ref{TautologicalTopologicalLineBundle} is well defined in that it indeed admits a [[local trivialization]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We claim that there is a local trivialization over the canonical cover of def. \ref{TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover}. This is given for $i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}$ by

$$
  \array{
    U_i \times k &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& T\vert_{U_i}
    \\
    ( [x_1 : \cdots x_{i-1}: 1 : x_{i+1} : \cdots : x_{n+1}] , c )
      &\mapsto&
    ( [x_1 : \cdots x_{i-1} : 1 : x_{i+1} : \cdots : x_{n+1} ], (c x_1, c x_2, \cdots , c x_{n+1}) )
  }
  \,.
$$

This is clearly a [[bijection]] of underlying sets.

To see that this function and its inverse function are continuous, hence that this is a [[homeomorphism]] notice that this map is the [[extension]] to the [[quotient topological space]] of the analogous map

$$
  \array{
    ( (x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{n+1}) , c)
     &\mapsto&
    ( (x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{n+1}) , (c x_1, \cdots c x_{i-1}, c, c x_{i+1}, \cdots, c x_{n+1}) )
  }
  \,.
$$

This is a [[polynomial]] function on [[Euclidean space]] and since [[polynomials are continuous]], this is continuous. Similarly the [[inverse function]] lifts to a [[rational function]] on a subspace of Euclidean space, and since [[rational functions are continuous]] on their domain of definition, also this lift is continuous.

Therefore by the [[universal property]] of the [[quotient topology]], also the original functions are continuous.

### Transition functions


We discuss how topological vector bundles are equivalently
given by [[cocycles]] (def. \ref{CocycleCech} below) in [[Cech cohomology]] (def. \ref{CohomologyCech})
constituted by their [[transition functions]] (def. \ref{TransitionFunctions} below). This allows to make precise the intuition that
vector bundles are precisely the result of "continuously gluing" trivial vector bundles onto each other"
(prop. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundlesCharacterizedByCechCohomology} below).

This gives a
"local-to-global principle" for constructions on vector bundles. For instance it
allows to easily obtain concepts of [[direct sum of vector bundles]] and [[tensor product of vector bundles]]
(def. \ref{DirectSumOfTopologicalVectorBundlesViaTransitionFunctions} and def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorBundles} below) by applying the usual operations from linear algebra on a local trivialization and then re-glung the result
via the combined transition functions.

$\,$

The definition of Cech cocycles is best stated with the following terminology in hand:

**([[continuous functions]] on [[open subsets]] with values in the [[general linear group]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, regard the [[general linear group]] $GL(n,k)$
as a [[topological group]] with its standard [[topological space|topology]],
given as the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[subspace topology]]
via $GL(n,k) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(k) \simeq k^{(n^2)}$ or as the
subspace topology $GL(n,k) \subset Maps(k^n, k^n)$ of the [[compact-open topology]] on the [[mapping space]].
(That these topologies coincide is the statement of [this prop.](general+linear+group#AsSubspaceOfTheMappingSpace).

For $X$ a [[topological space]], we write

$$
  \underline{GL(n,k)}

$g \colon U \to GL(n,k)$ (for $U \subset X$ equipped with its [[subspace topology]]), regarded as a
[[group]] via the pointwise group operation in $GL(n,k)$:

$$
   g_1 \cdot g_2 \;\colon\; x \mapsto g_1(x) \cdot g_2(x)
   \,.
$$

Moreover, for $U' \subset U \subset X$ an inclusion of open subsets, and for
$g \in \underline{GL(n,k)}(U)$, we write

$$
  g|_{U'} \in \underline{GL(n,k)}(U')

for the restriction of the continuous function from $U$ to $U'$.

with open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ and component functions $\{g_{i j}\}_{i,j \in I}$.

which is a [[continuous function]] (by the [[universal property]] of the [[quotient topological space]] construction, since the corresponding continuous [[function]] on the un-quotientd disjoint union space respects the equivalence relation).

in the category of vector space objects in the slice category $Top/X$. Here the restriction of $i$ to the coproduct summands is induced by inclusion:

$$(U_i \cap U_j) \times V \hookrightarrow U_i \times V \hookrightarrow \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \times V$$

and the restriction of $\mu$ to the coproduct summands is
via the action of the transition functions:

$$(U_i \cap U_j) \times V \overset{(\langle incl, g_{i j} \rangle) \times V}{\to} U_j \times GL(V) \times V \overset{action}{\to} U_j \times V \hookrightarrow \underset{j}{\sqcup} U_j \times V$$

whose components are the original local trivialization isomorphisms.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[universal property]] of the [[disjoint union space]] ([[coproduct]] in [[Top]]),
continuous functions out of them are equivalently sets of continuous functions out of every
summand space. Hence the set of local trivializations $\{U_i \times k^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} E|_{U_i} \subset E\}_{i \in I}$
may be collected into a single [[continuous function]]

$$
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
     \times
   k^n
   \overset{(\phi_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow }
   E
   \,.
$$

By construction this function respects the [[equivalence relation]] on the disjoint union space given by
the transition functions, in that for each $x \in U_i \cap U_j$ we have

$$
  \phi_i((x,i),v)
  =
  \phi_j \circ \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i((x,i),v)
  =
  \phi_j \circ ((x,j),g_{i j}(x)(v))
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[quotient space]] coprojection this means that $(\phi_i)_{i \in I}$
uniquely [[extension|extends]] to a [[continuous function]] on the quotient space such that the
following [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
    \right)
      \times
    k^n
    &\overset{(\phi_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}&
  E
  \\
  \downarrow  & \nearrow_{\exists !}
  \\
  \left(
    \left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
    \right)
      \times
    k^n
  \right)
  /
  \left(
     \left\{
        g_{i j}
     \right\}_{i,j \in I}
  \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

It is clear that this continuous function is a [[bijection]]. Hence to show that it is a
[[homeomorphism]], it is now sufficient to show that this is an [[open map]]
(by prop. \ref{HomeoContinuousOpenBijection}).

So let $O$  be a subset in the quotient space which is open. By definition of the
[[quotient topology]] this means equivalently that its restriction $O_i$ to $U_i \times k^n$
is open for each $i \in I$. Since the $\phi_i$ are [[homeomorphisms]], it follows that the
images $\phi_i(O_i)  \subset  E\vert_{U_ i}$ are open.
By the nature of the [[subspace topology]], this means that these images are open also in $E$.
Therefore also the union $f(O) = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \phi_i(O_i)$ is open.

###### Proof

By example \ref{FinerCoverCech} we may assume without restriction that the two Cech cocycles are
defined with respect to the same open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$
(for if they are not, then by example \ref{FinerCoverCech} both are cohomologous to
cocycles on a joint refinement of the original covers and we may argue with these).

Accordingly, by example \ref{TopologicalVectorBundleFromCechCocycle} the two bundles $E(c_1)$ and $E(c_2)$
both have local trivializations of the form

$$
  \{ U_i \times k^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_i}{\longrightarrow} E(c_1)\vert_{U_i}\}
$$

and

$$
  \{ U_i \times k^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^2_i}{\longrightarrow} E(c_2)\vert_{U_i}\}
$$

over this cover.  Consider then for $i \in I$ the function

$$
  f_i \coloneqq  (\phi_i^2)^{-1}\circ f\vert_{U_i} \circ  \phi^1_i
  \,,
$$

hence the unique function making the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    U_i \times k^n &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_i}{\longrightarrow}& E(c_1)\vert_{U_i}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f_i}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ f\vert_{U_i} }}
    \\
    U_i \times k^n &\underoverset{\phi^2_i}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& E(c_2)\vert_{U_i}
  }
  \,.
$$

This induces for all $i,j \in I$ the following composite commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    (U_i \cap U_j) \times k^n
      &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_i}{\longrightarrow}&
    E(c_1)\vert_{U_i \cap U_j}
      & \underoverset{\simeq}{(\phi^1_j)^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}  &
    (U_i \cap U_j) \times k^n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f_i}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ f\vert_{U_i \cap U_j} }}
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ f_j }}
    \\
    (U_i \cap U_j) \times k^n
      &\underoverset{\phi^2_i}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    E(c_2)\vert_{U_1 \cap U_2}
      &\underoverset{(\phi^2_j)^{-1}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    (U_i \cap U_j) \times k^n
  }
  \,.
$$

By construction, the two horizonal composites of this diagram are pointwise
given by the components $g^1_{i j}$ and $g^2_{i j}$of the cocycles $c_1$ and $c_2$, respectively.
Hence the commutativity of this
diagram is equivalently the commutativity of these diagrams:

  $$
    \array{
      k^n  &\overset{ g^1_{i j}(x) }{\longrightarrow}& k^n

the vertical morphism in the middle on the right is unique, by the fact that all other
morphisms in the diagram on the right are invertible.

Therefore by example \ref{ClosedSubspacesGluing} there is a unique vector bundle homomorphism

$$
  f\;\colon\; E(c_1) \to E(c_2)
$$

given for all $\alpha \in A$ by $f\vert_{V_\alpha} = f_\alpha$. Similarly there is a unique vector bundle
homomorphism

$$
  f^{-1}\;\colon\; E(c_2) \to E(c_1)
$$

given for all $\alpha \in A$ by $f^{-1}\vert_{V_\alpha} = f^{-1}_\alpha$.
Hence this is the required vector bundle isomorphism.

Finally to see that the function from Cech cohomology classes to isomorphism classes of vector
bundles thus defined is a bijection:

By prop. \ref{FromTransitionFunctionsReconstructVectorBundle} the function is [[surjective function|surjective]],
and by prop. \ref{CechCoboundaryFromIsomorphismBetweenVectoreBundles} it is injective.

### Properties

We discuss some basic general properties of topological vector bundles.

+-- {: .num_lemma #FiberwiseIsoisIsomorphismOfVectorBundles}
###### Lemma
**(homomorphism of vector bundles is isomorphism as soon as it is a fiberwise isomorphism)**

Let $[E_1 \to X]$ and $[E_2 \to X]$ be two topological vector bundles (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}).

If a [[homomorphism]] of vector bundles $f \colon E_1 \longrightarrow E_2$
restricts on the [[fiber]] over each point to a linear isomorphism

$$
  f\vert_x \;\colon\; (E_1)_x \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} (E_2)_x
$$

then $f$ is already an isomorphism of vector bundles.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that $f$ has an [[inverse function]]
of underlying sets $f^{-1} \colon E_2 \to E_1$ which is a function over $X$: Over each $x \in X$
it it the linear inverse $(f\vert_x)^{-1} \colon (E_2)_x \to (E_1)_x$.

What we need to show is that this is a continuous function.

By remark \ref{CommonOpenCoverLocalTrivialization} we find an open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ over which
both bundles have a local trivialization.


$$
  \left\{ U_i \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_i}{\to} (E_1)\vert_{U_i}\right\}_{i \in I}
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  \left\{ U_i \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^2_i}{\to} (E_2)\vert_{U_i} \right\}_{i \in I}
  \,.
$$

Restricted to any patch $i \in I$ of this cover, the homomorphism $f|_{U_i}$ induces a homomorphism
of  [[trivial vector bundles]]

$$
  f_i \coloneqq \phi^2_j^{-1} \circ f \circ \phi^1_i
   \phantom{AAAAAA}
  \array{
    U_i \times k^n &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi^1_i}{\longrightarrow}& (E_1)\vert|_{U_i}
    \\
    {}^{f_i}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f\vert_{U_i}}}
    \\
    U_i \times k^n &\underoverset{\phi^2_i}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& (E_2)\vert_{U_j}
  }
  \,.
$$

Also the $f_i$ are fiberwise invertible, hence are
continuous bijections. We claim that these are [[homeomorphisms]], hence that their
inverse functions $(f_i)^{-1}$ are also continuous.

To this end we re-write the $f_i$ a little. First observe that by the [[universal property]]
of the [[product topological space]] and since they fix the base space $U_i$, the $f_i$ are equivalently given by
a continuous function

$$
   h_i \;\colon\; U_i \times k^n \longrightarrow k^n
$$

as

$$
  f_i(x,v) = (x, h_i(x,v))
  \,.
$$

Moreover since $k^n$ is [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] (as every [[metric space]]),
the [[mapping space]] [[adjunction]] says (by prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyOfMappingSpace}) that there is a continuous function

$$
  \tilde h_i
    \;\colon\;
  U_i \longrightarrow Maps(k^n, k^n)
$$

(with $Maps(k^n,k^n)$ the set of continuous functions $k^n \to k^n$ equipped with the [[compact-open topology]])
which factors $h_i$ via the [[evaluation]] map as

$$
  h_i
    \;\colon\;
  U_i \times k^n
    \overset{\tilde h_i \times id_{k^n}}{\longrightarrow}
  Maps(k^n, k^n) \times k^n
    \overset{ev}{\longrightarrow}
  k^n
  \,.
$$

By assumption of fiberwise
linearity the functions $\tilde h_i$ in fact take values in the [[general linear group]]

$$
  GL(n,k) \subset Maps(k^n, k^n)
$$

and this inclusion is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image (by [this prop.](general+linear+group#AsSubspaceOfTheMappingSpace)).

Since passing to [[inverse matrices]]

$$
  (-)^{-1} \;\colon\; GL(n,k) \longrightarrow GL(n,k)
$$

is a [[rational function]] on its domain $GL(n,k) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(k) \simeq k^{(n^2)}$ inside [[Euclidean space]]
and since [[rational functions are continuous]] on their domain of definition,
it follows that the inverse of $f_i$

$$
  (f_i)^{-1}
    \;\colon\;
  U_i \times k^n
    \overset{(id  , \tilde h_i )  }{\longrightarrow}
  U_i \times k^n \times GL(n,k)
    \overset{ id  \times (-)^{-1} }{\longrightarrow}
  U_i \times k^n \times GL(n,k)
    \overset{id  \times ev}{\longrightarrow}
  U_i \times k^n
$$

is a continuous function.

To conclude that also $f^{-1}$ is a continuous function we make use prop. \ref{FromTransitionFunctionsReconstructVectorBundle}
to find an isomorphism between $E_2$ and a [[quotient topological space]] of the form

$$
  E_2 \simeq \left(\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (U_i \times k^n) \right) / \left(  \left\{ g_{i j}\right\}_{i,j\in I} \right)
  \,.
$$

Hence $f^{-1}$ is equivalently a function on this quotient space, and we need to show that as such it is continuous.

By the [[universal property]] of the [[disjoint union space]] (the [[coproduct]] in [[Top]]) the set of continuous functions

$$
  \{ U_i \times k^n \overset{f_i^{-1}}{\to} U_i \times k^n \overset{\phi^1_i}{\to} E_1 \}_{i \in I}
$$

corresponds to a single continuous function

$$
  (\phi^1_i \circ f_i^{-1})_{i \in I}
    \;\colon\;
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i \times k^n
    \longrightarrow
  E_1
  \,.
$$

These functions respect the equivalence relation, since for each $x \in U_i \cap U_j$ we have

$$
  (\phi^1_i \circ f_i^{-1})((x,i),v)
    =
  (\phi^1_j \circ f_j^{-1})( (x,j), g_{i j}(x)(v) )
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \text{since:}
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \array{
    && E_1
    \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\phi^1_i \circ f_i^{-1}}}\nearrow
     &
       \uparrow^{\mathrlap{f^{-1}}}
     & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{ \phi^1_j \circ f_j^{-1} }}
    \\
    U_i \times k^n
      &\underset{\phi^2_i}{\longrightarrow}&
    (E_2)\vert_{U_i \cap U_i}
      &\underset{(\phi^2_j)^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    U_i \times k^n
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore by the [[universal property]] of the [[quotient topological space]] $E_2$, these functions
[[extension|extend]] to a unique continuous function $E_2 \to E_1$ such that the following
[[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in i}{\sqcup} U_i \times k^n
      &\overset{( \phi^1_i \circ f_i^{-1} )_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E_1
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists !}}
    \\
    E_2
  }
  \,.
$$

This unique function is clearly $f^{-1}$ (by pointwise inspection) and therefore $f^{-1}$ is continuous.


=--


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**(fiberwise linearly independent sections trivialize a vector bundle)**

If a topological vector bundle $E \to X$ of [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]] $n$
admits $n$ [[sections]] (example \ref{VectorBundleSections})

$$
  \{\sigma_k \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow E\}_{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}
$$

that are linearly independent at each point $x \in X$, then $E$ is trivializable (example \ref{TrivialTopologicalVectorBundle}).
In fact, with the sections regarded as vector bundle homomorphisms out of the trivial vector bundle
of rank $n$ (according to example \ref{VectorBundleSections}), these sections _are_ the trivialization

$$
  (\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_n)
  \;\colon\;
  (X \times k^n)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E
  \,.
$$

This is because their linear independence at each point means precisely that this
morphism of vector bundles is a fiber-wise linear isomorphsm
and therefore an isomorphism of vector bundles by lemma \ref{FiberwiseIsoisIsomorphismOfVectorBundles}.

## Manifolds
 {#Manifolds}

A _[[topological manifold]]_ is a [[topological space]] which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]]
(def. \ref{TopologicalManifold} below), but which may globally look very different.
These are the kinds of topological spaces that are really meant when people advertise [[topology]]
as "[[rubber-sheet geometry]]".

If the [[gluing functions]] which relate the Euclidean [[local charts]] of  topological manifolds to each other are [[differentiable functions]], for a fixed degree of differentiability, then one speaks of _[[differentiable manifolds]]_ (def \ref{DifferentiableManifold} below) or of _[[smooth manifolds]]_ if the gluing functions are arbitrarily differentiable.

Accordingly, a differentiable manifold is a space to which the tools of [[infinitesimal analysis|infinitesimal]] [[analysis]] may be applied _locally_.
In particular we may ask whether a [[continuous function]] between differentiable manifolds is [[differentiation|differentiable]]
by computing its [[derivatives]] pointwise in any of the Euclidean [[coordinate charts]].
This way differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for what is called _[[differential geometry]]_.
(They are the analogs in differential geometry of what [[schemes]] are in [[algebraic geometry]].)

Basic examples of smooth manifolds are the [[n-spheres]] (example \ref{SmoothManifoldnSphere} below),
the [[projective spaces]] (example \ref{SmoothManifoldRealComplexProjectiveSpace} below).
and the [[general linear group]] (example \ref{SmoothManifoldGeneralLinearGroup}) below.



$\,$


The definition of [[topological manifolds]] (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold} below) involves two clauses:
The conceptual condition is that a manifold is  _[[locally Euclidean topological space]]_ (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace} below).
On top of this one demands as a technical regularity
condition [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space|paracompact Hausdorffness]], which serves to ensure that manifolds behave well.
Therefore we first consider locally Euclidean spaces in themselves.

+-- {: .num_defn #LocallyEuclideanSpace}
###### Definition
**([[locally Euclidean topological space]])**

A [[topological space]] $X$ is _[[locally Euclidean topological space|locally Euclidean]]_ if every point $x \in X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ which,
as a [[subspace]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}), is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism})
to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (def. \ref{MetricTopology}):

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n
    \overset{\phantom{AA} \simeq \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  U_x
    \subset
  X

The "local" [[topological properties]] of Euclidean space are inherited by locally Euclidean spaces:

###### Proposition
**([[locally Euclidean spaces]] are $T_1$-[[separation axiom|separated]], [[sober topological space|sober]], [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]], [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]] and [[locally path-connected topological spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[locally Euclidean space]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}). Then

1. $X$ satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $X$ is [[sober topological space|sober]] (def. \ref{Sober});

1. $X$ is [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] in the weak sense of def. \ref{LocalCompactnessViaCompactNeighbourhoodBase}.

1. $X$ is [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]] (def. \ref{LocallyConnected}),

1. $X$ is [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] (def. \ref{PathConnectedLocally}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

Let $x \neq y$ be two distinct points in the locally Euclidean space. We need to show that there is an open neighbourhood $U_x$ around $x$ that does not contain $y$.

By definition, there is a Euclidean open neighbourhood $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U_x \subset X$ around $x$. If $U_x$ does not contain $y$, then it already is an open neighbourhood as required. If $U_x$ does contain $y$, then $\phi^{-1}(x) \neq \phi^{-1}(y)$ are equivalently two distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^n$. But Euclidean space, as every [[metric space]], is $T_1$ (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}, prop. \ref{TnImplications}), and hence we may find an open neighbourhood $V_{\phi^{-1}(x)} \subset \mathbb{R}^n $ not containing $\phi^{-1}(y)$. By the nature of the [[subspace topology]], $\phi(V_{\phi^{-1}(x)}) \subset X$ is an open neighbourhood as required.

Regarding the second statement:

We need to show that the map

$$
  Cl(\{-\}) \;\colon\; X \to IrrClSub(X)
$$

that sends points to the [[topological closure]] of their singleton sets is a [[bijection]] with the set of [[irreducible closed subsets]]. By the first statement above the map is [[injective function|injective]] (via lemma \ref{T1InTermsOfTopologicalClosure}).
Hence it remains to see that every irreducible closed subset is the topological closure of a singleton. We will show something stronger: every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.

Let $P \subset X$ be an open proper subset such that if there are two open subsets $U_1, U_2 \subset X$ with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ then $U_1 \subset P$ or $U_2 \subset P$. By prop \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}) we need to show that there exists a point $x \in X$ such that $P = X \setminus \{x\}$ it its [[complement]].

Now since $P \subset X$ is a proper subset, and since the locally Euclidean space $X$ is covered by Euclidean neighbourhoods, there exists a Euclidean neighbourhood $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U \subset X$ such that $P \cap U \subset U$ is a proper subset. In fact this still satisfies the condition that for $U_1, U_2 \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} U$ then $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P \cap U$ implies $U_1 \subset P \cap U$ or $U_2 \subset P \cap U$. Accordingly, by prop. \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}, it follows that $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \phi^{-1}(P \cap U)$ is an irreducible closed subset of [[Euclidean space]]. Sine [[metric spaces]] are [[sober topological space]] as well as $T_1$-[[separation axiom|separated]] (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}, prop. \ref{SoberFromHausdorff}), this means that there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\phi^{-1}(P \cap U) = \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{x\}$.

In conclusion this means that the restriction of an irreducible closed subset in $X$ to any Euclidean chart is either empty or a singleton set. This means that the irreducible closed subset must be a disjoint union of singletons that are separated by Euclidean neighbourhoods. But by irreducibiliy, this union has to consist of just one point.


Regarding the third statement:

Let $x \in X$ be a point and let $U_x \supset \{x\}$ be an open neighbourhood. We need to find a compact neighbourhood $K_x \subset U_x$.

By assumption there exists a Euclidean open neighbourhood $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} V_x \subset X$. By definition of the [[subspace topology]] the intersection $U_x \cap V_x$ is still open as a subspace of $V_x$ and hence $\phi^{-1}(U_x \cap V_x)$ is an open neighbourhood of $\phi^{-1}(x)  \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

Since Euclidean spaces are locally compact (example \ref{MetricSpacesAreLocallyCompact}), there exists
a compact neighbourhood $K_{\phi^{-1}(x)} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (for instance a sufficiently small [[closed ball]] around $x$, which is compact by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]], prop. \ref{BorelHeine}).
Now since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] prop. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}, it follows
that also $\phi(K) \subset X$ is a compact neighbourhood.

Regarding the last two statements:

We need to show that for every point $x \in X$ and every [neighbourhood $U_x \supset \{x\}$
there exists a neighbourhood $C_x \subset U_x$ which is [[connected topological space|connected]]
and a neighbourhood$PC_x \subset U_x$ which is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]].

By local Euclideanness there exists a chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} V_x \subset X$.
Since [[Euclidean space]] is locally connected and locally path-connected (def. \ref{PathConnectedComponents}), there is a connected and a path-connected
neighbourhood of the pre-image $\phi^{-1}(x)$ contained in the pre-image $\phi^{-1}( U_x \cap V_x )$.
Since continuous images of connected spaces
are connected (prop. \ref{ContinuousImagesOfConnectedSpacesAreConnected}), and
since continuous images of path-connected spaces
are path-connected (prop. \ref{PathConnectedContinuousImage}), the images of these neighbourhoods under $\phi$ are neighbourhoods of $x$ as required.

=--

It follows immediately from prop. \ref{LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace} via prop. \ref{ForLocallyPathConnectedThenPathConnectedComponentsAgree} that:

+-- {: .num_prop #PathConnectedFromConnectedLocallyEuclideanSpace}
###### Proposition
**([[connected topological space|connected]] [[locally Euclidean spaces]] are [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]])**

For a [[locally Euclidean space]] $(X,\tau)$ (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace})
the  [[connected components]] (def. \ref{ComponentsConnected})
coincide with the [[path-connected topological space|path-connected components]] (def. \ref{PathConnectedComponents}).

=--



But the "global" topological properties of Euclidean space are not generally inherited by locally Euclidean spaces. This sounds obvious, but notice that also Hausdorff-ness is a "global property":

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(locally Euclidean spaces are not necessarily $T_2$)**

It might superficially seem that every locally Euclidean space (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}) is necessarily a [[Hausdorff topological space]], since [[Euclidean space]], like any [[metric space]], is Hausdorff, and since by definition the neighbourhood of every point in a locally Euclidean spaces looks like Euclidean space.

But this is not so, see the counter-example \ref{NonHausdorffManifolds} below, Hausdorffness is a "non-local condition", as opposed to the $T_0$ and $T_1$ [[separation axioms]].

Therefore we will explicitly impose Hausdorffness on top of local Euclidean-ness.
This implies the equivalence of following further regularity properties:



+-- {: .num_prop #RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison}
###### Proposition
**(equivalence of regularity conditions for [[locally Euclidean space|locally Euclidean]] [[Hausdorff spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[locally Euclidean space]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace})
which is [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}).

Then the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]] (def. \ref{CompactSigma}).

1. $X$ is [[second-countable topological space|second-countable]] (def. \ref{CountableSecond}).

1. $X$ is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] (def. \ref{ParacompactSpace}) and has a [[countable set]] of [[connected components]] (def. \ref{ComponentsConnected}).


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First, observe that $X$ is [[locally compact]] in the strong sense of def. \ref{LocallyCompactSpace}:
By prop. \ref{LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace} every locally Euclidean space is locally compact in the weak sense that every
[[neighbourhood]] contains a compact neighbourhood, but since $X$ is assumed to be Hausdorff,
this implies the stronger statement by prop. \ref{InHausdorffSpacesDefinitionsOfLocalCompactnessAgree}.

**1) $\Rightarrow$ 2)**

Let $X$ be sigma-compact. We show that then $X$ is [[second-countable topological space|second-countable]]:

By sigma-compactness there exists a [[countable set]] $\{K_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of compact subspaces. By $X$ being locally Euclidean, each  $K_i$ admits an [[open cover]] by restrictions of [[Euclidean spaces]]. By their compactness, each $K_i$
has a subcover

$$
  \{ \mathbb{R}^{n_{j}} \overset{\phi_{i,j}}{\to} X \}_{j \in J_i}
$$

with $J_i$ a finite set. Since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]], we have
obtained  a countable cover of $X$ by Euclidean spaces $\{ \mathbb{R}^n  \overset{\phi_{i,j}}{\to} X\}_{i \in I, j \in J_i}$. Now Euclidean space itself is second countable (by example \ref{SecondCountableEuclideanSpace}), hence admits a countable set $\beta_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ of base open sets. As a result the union $\underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J_i}}{\cup} \phi_{i,j}(\beta_{\mathbb{R}^n})$ is a base of opens for $X$. But this is a countable union of countable sets, and since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]] we have obtained a countable base for the topology of $X$. This means that $X$ is second-countable.

**1) $\Rightarrow$ 3)**

Let $X$ be sigma-compact. We show that then $X$ is paracompact with a countable set of connected components:

Since [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]] (prop. \ref{ParacompactFromLocallyCompactAndSigmacompact}), it follows that $X$ is paracompact. By [[locally connected topological space|local connectivity]] (prop. \ref{LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace}) $X$ is the [[disjoint union space]] of its [[connected components]] (def. \ref{LocallyConnected}, lemma \ref{AlternativeCharacterizationOfLocalConnectivity}). Since, by the previous statement, $X$ is also second-countable it cannot have an uncountable set of connected components. (Because there must be at least one base open contained in every connected component.)

**2)$\Rightarrow$ 1)** Let $X$ be second-countable, we need to show that it is sigma-compact.

This follows since [[locally compact and second-countable spaces are sigma-compact]] (lemma \ref{SigmaCompactFromLocallyCompactAndSecondCountable}).

**3) $\Rightarrow$ 1)**

Now let $X$ be paracompact with countably many connected components. We show that $X$ is sigma-compact.

By [[locally compact topological space|local compactness]], there exists an open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$
such that
the topological closures $\{K_i \coloneqq Cl(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$
constitute a cover by [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspaces]].
By paracompactness there is a locally finite refinement of this cover.
Since [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal]] (prop. \ref{ParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreNormal}), the [[shrinking lemma]] applies (lemma \ref{ShrinkingLemmaForLocallyFiniteCountableCovers}) to this refinement and yields a locally finite open cover

$$
  \mathcal{V} \coloneqq \{V_j \subset X \}_{j \in J}
$$

as well as a locally finite cover $\{Cl(V_j) \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ by closed subsets. Since this is a refinement of the orignal cover, all the $Cl(V_j)$ are contained in one of the compact subspaces $K_i$. Since [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] (lemma \ref{SubsetsInClosedSubspace}), the $Cl(V_j)$ are also closed as subsets of the $K_i$.
Since [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}) it follows that the $Cl(V_j)$ are themselves compact and hence form a locally finite cover by compact subspaces.

Now fix any $j_0 \in J$.

We claim that for every $j \in J$ there is a finite sequence of indices $(j_0, j_1, \cdots, j_n, j_{n} = j)$ with the property
that $V_{j_k} \cap V_{j_{k+1}} \neq \emptyset$ for all $k \in \{0, \cdots, n\}$.

To see this, first observe that it is sufficient to show sigma-compactness for the case that $X$ is [[connected topological space|connected]]. From this the general statement follows since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]]. Hence assume that $X$ is connected.
It follows from prop. \ref{PathConnectedFromConnectedLocallyEuclideanSpace} that  $X$ is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]].

Hence for any $x \in V_{j_0}$ and $y \in V_{j}$ there is a path $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ (def. \ref{Path}) connecting $x$ with $y$. Since the [[closed interval]] is compact (example \ref{CompactClosedInterval})
and since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (prop. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}), it follows that there is a finite subset of the $V_i$ that covers the image of this path. This proves the claim.

It follows that there is a function

$$
  f \;\colon\; \mathcal{V} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}
$$

which sends each $V_j$ to the [[minimum]] natural number $n$ as above.

We claim now that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[preimage]] of $\{0,1, \cdots, n\}$ under this function is a [[finite set]].
Since [[countable unions of countable sets are countable]] this
means that $f$ serves as a countable enumeration of the set $J$ and hence implies that $\{ Cl(V_j) \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ is a countable cover of $X$ by compact subspaces, hence that $X$ is sigma-compact.

We prove this last claim by [[induction]]. It is true for $n = 0$ by construction, since $f^{-1}(\{0\}) = V_{j_0}$. Assume it is true for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, hence that $f^{-1}(\{0,1, \cdots, n\})$ is a finite set. Since finite unions of compact subspaces are again compact (example \ref{UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces}) it follows that

$$
  K_n
    \coloneqq
  \underset{V \in f^{-1}(\{0,\cdots, n\})}{\cup} Cl(V)
$$

is compact. By local finiteness of the $\{Cl(V_j)\}_{j \in J}$, every point $x \in K_n$ has an open neighbourhood $W_x$ that intersects only a finite set of the $Cl(V_j)$. By compactness of $K_n$, the cover $\{W_x \cap K_nfGi \subset K_n\}_{x \in K_n}$ has a finite subcover. In conclusion this implies that only a finite number of the $V_j$ intersect $K_n$.

Now by definition $f^{-1}(\{0,1,\cdots, n+1\})$ is a subset of those $V_j$ which intersect $K_n$, and hence itself finite.

This finally gives a good idea of what the definition of topological manifolds should be:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalManifold}
###### Definition
**([[topological manifold]])**

A _topological manifold is a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[locally Euclidean topological space|locally Euclidean]] (def. \ref{LocallyEuclideanSpace}),

1. [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space|paracompact Hausdorff]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}, def. \ref{ParacompactSpace}).

If the [[Euclidean spaces|Euclidean]] [[neighbourhoods]] $\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} U_x \subset X$
of the points $x \in X$ are all of [[dimension]] $n$
for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then the topological manifold is said to be of dimension $n$, too.
Sometimes one also speaks of an "$n$-fold" in this case.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(varying terminology regarding "topological manifold")**

Often a _topological manifold_ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold})
is required
to be [[second-countable topological space|second-countable]] (def. \ref{CountableSecond})
or [[sigma-compact]] (def. \ref{CompactSigma}). But by
prop. \ref{RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison} both
conditions are implied by def. \ref{TopologicalManifold} as soon as there is a [[countable set]] of [[connected components]].
Manifolds with uncountably many connected components are rarely considered in practice.
The restriction to countably many connected components is strictly necessary
for several important theorems (beyond the scope of our discussion here) such as:

1. the [[Whitney embedding theorem]];

1. the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]].

=--

Besides the trivial case of [[Euclidean spaces]] themselves,
we discuss here three main classes of  **examples** of manifolds:

1. [[n-spheres]] $S^n$ (example \ref{SmoothManifoldnSphere} below)

1. [[projective spaces]] $k P^n$ (example \ref{SmoothManifoldRealComplexProjectiveSpace} below)

1. [[general linear groups]] $GL(n,k)$ (example \ref{SmoothManifoldGeneralLinearGroup}) below.

Since all these examples are not just [[topological manifolds]] but naturally carry
also the structure of _[[differentiable manifolds]]_, we first consider
this richer definition before turning to the examples:

1. An [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ and a [[homeomorphism]] $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U$

1. An [[open cover]] of $X$ by local charts $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ is called an _[[atlas]]_ of the topological manifold.

1. Given such an [[atlas]] then for each $i,j \in I$ the induced homeomorphism

   is called the _[[gluing function]]_ from chart $i$ to chart $j$.

Next we consider the case that the gluing functions of a topologiclal manifold
are [[differentiable functions]] in which case one speaks of a _[[differentiable manifold]]_ (def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold} below).
For convenience we first recall the definition of [[differentiable functions]]
between [[Euclidean spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentiableFunctionBetweenCartesianSpaces}
###### Definition
**([[differentiable functions]] between [[Euclidean spaces]])**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open subset]] of [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

Then a [[function]] $f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called  **differentiable** at $x\in U$
if there exists a [[linear map]] $d f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the following [[limit of a sequence|limit]]
exists and vanishes as $h$ approaches zero "from all directions at once":

$$
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} = 0.
$$

This means that for all $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] $V_x\subseteq U$ of $x$ such that whenever $x+h\in V$ we have $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} \lt \epsilon$.

We say that $f$ is _differentiable on_ a [[subset]] $S$ of $U$ if $f$ is differentiable at every $x\in S$,
and we say that $f$ is _differentiable_ if $f$ is differentiable on all of $U$.
We say that $f$ is *continuously differentiable* if it is differentiable and  $d f$ is a [[continuous function]].

The function $d f_x$ is called the **derivative** or **differential of $f$ at $x$**.

More generally, let $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ be an [[open subset]].

Then a [[function]] $f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ is _differentiable_  if for all $i \in \{1, \cdots, n_2\}$ the component function

$$
  f_i \;\colon\; U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^{n_2} \overset{pr_i}{\longrightarrow}  \mathbb{R}
$$

is differentiable in the previous sense

In this case, the derivatives $d f_i \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ of the $f_i$ assemble into a linear map  of the form

$$
  d f_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
  \,.
$$

If the derivative exists at each $x \in U$, then it defines itself a function

$$
  d f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow Hom_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1} , \mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \cdot n_2}
$$

to the space of [[linear maps]] from $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$, which is canonically itself a [[Euclidean space]]. We say that $f$ is _twice continuously differentiable_ if $d f$ is continuously differentiable.

Generally then, for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the function $f$ is called _$k$-fold continuously differentiable_ or _of class $C^k$_ if
for all $j \leq k$ the $j$-fold differential $d^j f$ exists and is a continuous function.

Finally, if $f$ is $k$-fold continuously differentiable for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ then it is called a _[[smooth function]]_
or _of class $C^\infty$_.

Of the various properties satisfied by [[differentiation]], the following plays a special role in the theory of
differentiable manifolds (notably in the discussion of their [[tangent bundles]], def. \ref{TangentBundle} below):

**([[differentiable manifold]] and [[smooth manifold]])**

For $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then a $p$-fold _[[differentiable manifold]]_ or _$C^p$-manifold_ for short is

1. a [[topological manifold]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold});

1. an [[atlas]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\}$ (def. \ref{Charts}) all whose [[gluing functions]]  are $p$ times continuously [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

  is a $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between open subsets of [[Euclidean space]].

(Notice that this in in general  a non-trivial condition even if $X = Y$ and $f$ is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.)

If a manifold is $C^p$ differentiable for all $p$, then it is called a _[[smooth manifold]]_.
Accordingly a continuous function between differentiable manifolds which is $p$-fold differentiable
for all $p$ is called a _[[smooth function]]_,

###### Definition
**([[diffeomorphism]])**

Given [[smooth manifolds]] $X$ and $Y$ (def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}), then a [[smooth function]]

  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is called a _[[diffeomorphism]]_, if there is an [[inverse function]]

$$
  X \longleftarrow Y \;\colon\; g
$$

which is also a [[smooth function]] (hence if $f$ is an [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]]${}_\infty$
from remark \ref{CategoryDiff}).

=--

Here it is important to note that while being a [[topological manifold]] is just a [[property]]
of a [[topological space]], a [[differentiable manifold]] carries [[extra structure]] encoded in the
[[atlas]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #SmoothStructure}
###### Definition
**([[smooth structure]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological manifold]] (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}) and let

$$
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
  \right)_{i \in I}
  \phantom{AAA}
   \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
  \right)_{j \in J}
$$

be two [[atlases]] (def. \ref{Charts}), both making $X$ into a [[smooth manifold]] (def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}).

Then there is a [[diffeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Diffeomorphism}) of the form

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  \left(
    X
      \;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
    \right)_{i \in I}
  \right)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(
    X\;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
    \right)_{j \in J}
  \right)
$$

precisely if the [[identity function]] on the underlying set of $X$ constitutes such a diffeomorphism.
(Because if $f$ is a diffeomorphism, then also $f^{-1}\circ f = id_X$ is a diffeomorphism.)

That the identity function is a diffeomorphism between $X$ equipped with these two atlases means,
by definition \ref{DifferentiableManifold}, that

$$
  \underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \phi_i^{-1}(V_j) \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n
    \phantom{AA}
    \text{is smooth}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Notice that the functions on the right may equivalently be written as

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \supset
   \,
   \phi_i^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)
     \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
    U_i \cap V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \psi_j^{-1}(U_i \cap V_j) \; \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

showing their analogy to the gluing functions within a single atlas (def. \ref{Charts}).

Hence diffeomorphsm induces an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of
smooth atlases that exist on a given [[topological manifold]] $X$. An [[equivalence class]]
with respect to this equivalence relation is called a _[[smooth structure]]_ on $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #DifferentiableManifoldCartesianSpace}
###### Example
**([[Cartesian space]] as a [[smooth manifold]])

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the [[atlas]] consisting of the single [[chart]] $\mathbb{R}^n \overset{id}{\to} \mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[smooth manifold]], in particularly a $p$-fold differentiable manifold for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$ according to def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}.

Similarly the [[open disk]] $D^n$ becomes a [[smooth  manifold]] when equipped with the atlas whose single chart is the [[homeomorphism]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to D^n$.

This defines a [[smooth structure]] (def.  \ref{SmoothStructure}) on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $D^n$.
Strikingly, precisely for $n = 4$ there are _other_ smooth structures on $\mathbb{R}^4$,
hence called _[[exotic smooth structures]]_.

+-- {: .num_example #SmoothManifoldnSphere}
###### Example
**([[n-sphere]] as a [[smooth manifold]])**

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ becomes a smooth manfold, with [[atlas]] consisting of the two [[local charts]] that are given by the [[inverse functions]] of the [[stereographic projection]] from the two poles of the sphere onto the [[equator|equatorial]] hyperplane

$$
  \left\{

       \underoverset{\simeq}{\sigma^{-1}_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.
$$

By the formula given in the proof of prop. \ref{StandardStereographicProjection}  the induced [[gluing function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\}$ are [[rational functions]] and hence [[smooth functions]].

Finally the $n$-sphere is a [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space]]. Ways to see this include:

1. $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a [[compact subspace]] by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] (prop. \ref{BorelHeine}). Compact spaces are also paracompact (example \ref{CompactSpaceIsParacompact}).
Moreover, [[Euclidean space]], like any [[metric space]], is Hausdorff (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}),
and [[subspaces]] of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff;

1. The $n$-sphere has the structure of a [[CW-complex]] (example \ref{TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself}) and [[CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces]] (example \ref{ParacompactHausdorffCWComplexes}).

###### Example
**([[open subsets]] of differentiable manifolds are again differentiable manifolds)**

Let $X$ be a $k$-fold differentiable manifold and let $S \subset X$
be an [[open subset]] of the underlying [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$.

Then $S$ carries the structure of a $k$-fold differentiable manifold such that the
inclusion map $S \hookrightarrow X$ is an [[open embedding|open]]
[[embedding of differentiable manifolds]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Since the underlying [[topological space]] of $X$ is [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]] ([this prop.](topological+manifold#LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace)) it is the [[disjoint union space]] of its [[connected components]] ([this prop.](locally+connected+topological+space#AlternativeCharacterizationsOfLocalConnectivity)).

Therefore we are reduced to showing the statement for the case that $X$ has a single [[connected component]]. By [this prop](topological+manifold#RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison) this implies that $X$ is [[second-countable topological space]].

Now a [[subspace]] of a second-countable Hausdorff space is clearly itself second countable and Hausdorff.

Similarly it is immediate that $S$ is still [[locally Euclidean space|locally Euclidean]]: since $X$ is locally Euclidean every point $x \in S \subset X$ has a Euclidean neighbourhood in $X$ and since $S$ is open there exists an open ball in that (itself [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to Euclidean space) which is a Euclidean neighbourhood of $x$ contained in $S$.

For the differentiable structure we pick these Euclidean neighbourhoods from the given atlas.
Then the [[gluing functions]] for the Euclidean charts on $S$ are $k$-fold differentiable follows since these are restrictions of the gluing functions for the atlas of $X$.

**([[general linear group]] as a [[smooth manifold]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[general  linear group]] $Gl(n,\mathbb{R})$ (example \ref{GLn})
is a [[smooth manifold]]
(as an [[open subspace]] of [[Euclidean space]] $GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R} \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)})$,
via example \ref{OpenSubsetsOfDifferentiableManifoldsAreDifferentiableManifolds} and example \ref{DifferentiableManifoldCartesianSpace}).

The group operations are [[smooth functions]] with respect to this smooth manifold structure, and thus $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$
is a _[[Lie group]]_.

Next we want to show that [[real projective space]] and [[complex projective space]] (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace})
carry the structure of differentiable manifolds. To that end first re-consider their standard open cover (def. \ref{TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover}).

**(standard open cover of [[projective space]] is [[atlas]])**

###### Proof

If $x_i \neq 0$ then

$$
  [x_1 : \cdots : x_i : \cdots : x_{n+1}]
  =
  \left[
    \frac{x_1}{x_i} : \cdots : 1 : \cdots \frac{x_{n+1}}{x_i}
  \right]
$$

and the representatives of the form on the right are _unique_.

This means that

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n &\overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}& U_i
    \\
    (x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    &\mapsto&
    [x_1: \cdots: 1: \cdots : x_n+1]
  }
$$

is a bijection of sets.

To see that this is a [[continuous function]], notice that it is the composite

$$
  \array{
    && \mathrlap{\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{x_i = 0\}}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \phi_i}}\nearrow & \downarrow

of the function

    (x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{n+1})
    &\mapsto&
    (x_1, \cdots, 1, \cdots ,x_n+1)
  }
$$

with the quotient projection. Now $\hat \phi_i$ is a [[polynomial]] function and since [[polynomials are continuous]], and since the projection to a [[quotient topological space]] is continuous, and since composites of continuous functions are continuous, it follows that $\phi_i$ is continuous.

It remains to see that also the [[inverse function]] $\phi_i^{-1}$ is continuous.
Since

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{x_i = 0\}
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    U_i

    ( \frac{x_1}{x_i}, \cdots, \frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \cdots , \frac{x_{n+1}}{x_i})
  }
$$

is a [[rational function]], and since [[rational functions are continuous]], it follows, by nature of the [[quotient topology]], that $\phi_i$ takes open subsets to open subsets, hence that $\phi_i^{-1}$ is continuous.

###### Example
**([[real projective space|real]]/[[complex projective space]] is [[smooth manifold]])**

For $k \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}\}$ the topological [[projective space]] $k P^n$ (def. \ref{ToplogicalProjectiveSpace}) is a [[topological manifold]] (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}).

Equipped with the standard open cover of def. \ref{TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover} regarded as an [[atlas]] by lemma \ref{ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas}, it is a [[differentiable manifold]], in fact a [[smooth manifold]] (def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas} $k P^n$ is a [[locally Euclidean space]]. Moreover, $kP^n$ admits the structure of a [[CW-complex]] ([this prop.](real+projective+space#RealProjectiveSpaceCWComplex)
and [this prop.](complex+projective+space#CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace))
and therefore it is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] since [[CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces]]. This means that it is a [[topological manifold]].

It remains to see that the [[gluing functions]] of this atlas are [[differentiable functions]] and in fact [[smooth functions]]. But by lemma \ref{ProjectiveSpaceOpenCoverIsAtlas} they are even [[rational functions]].

Since [[differentiable manifolds]] are [[locally Euclidean spaces]] whose [[gluing functions]]
respect the [[infinitesimal analysis]] on [[Euclidean space]], they constitute a globalization of
[[infinitesimal analysis]] from [[Euclidean space]] to more general [[topological spaces]].
In particular a [[differentiable manifold]] has associated to each point a _[[tangent space]]_
of [[vectors]] that linearly approximate the manifold in the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]]
of that point. The union of all these [[tangent spaces]] is called the _[[tangent bundle]]_
of the [[differentiable manifold]].

The tangent bundle, via the [[frame bundle]] that is [[associated bundle|associated]] to it
is the basis for all actual _[[geometry]]_: By equipping tangent bundles with
([[torsion of a G-structure|torsion-free]]) "[[G-structures]]"
one encodes all sorts of flavors of geometry, such as [[Riemannian geometry]],
[[conformal geometry]], [[complex geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]], and generally
[[Cartan geometry]].

$$

saying that two such functions are related precisely if either there exists a chart around $x$ such that (or else for all charts around $x$ it is true that) the first [[derivative]] of the two functions regarded via the given chart as functions $\mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^n$, coincide at $t = 0$ (with $t$ denoting the canonical [[coordinate]] function on $\mathbb{R}$).

+-- {: .num_lemma #TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}
###### Lemma
**(tangency is equivalence relation)**

The two relations in def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves} are [[equivalence relations]] and they coincide.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that they conincide, we need to show that if the derivatives in question coincide in one chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U_i \subset X$, that then they coincide also in any other chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi}{\to} U_j \subset X$.

Write

$$
  U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
$$

for the intersection of the two charts.

First of all, since the derivative may be computed in any [[open neighbourhood]] around $t = 0$, and since the differentiable functions $\gamma_i$ are in particular [[continuous functions]], we may restrict to the open neighbourhood

$$
  V \coloneqq \gamma_1^{-1}( U_{i j} ) \cap \gamma_2^{-1}(U_{i j})
  \;\subset\; \mathbb{R}
$$

of $0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and consider the derivatives of the functions

$$
  \gamma_i^{\phi}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\phi\vert_{U_{i j}} \circ \gamma_i\vert_{V}) \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \phi^{-1}(U_{i j}) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

and

$$
  \gamma_i^{\psi}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\psi\vert_{U_{i j}} \circ \gamma_i \vert _{V}) \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \psi^{-1}(U_{i j}) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

But then by definition of the differentiable [[atlas]], there is the differentiable function

$$
  \alpha
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \phi^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}
  U_{i j}
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  \psi^{-1}(U_i j)
$$

such that


$$
  \gamma_i^\psi = \alpha \circ \gamma_i^\phi
$$

for $i \in \{1,2\}$. The [[chain rule]] now relates the derivatives of these functions as

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \gamma_i^\psi
    \;=\;
  (D \alpha) \circ \left(\frac{d}{d t} \gamma_i^\phi\right)
  \,.
$$

Since $\alpha$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] and since derivatives of diffeomorphisms are linear isomorphisms, this says that the derivative of $\gamma_i^\phi$ is related to that of $\gamma_i^\psi$ by a linear isomorphism, and hence

$$
  \left(
   \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_1)^\phi = \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_2^\phi)
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
   \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_1)^\psi = \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_2^\psi)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Finally, that either relation is an equivalence relation is immediate.

###### Definition
**([[tangent vector]])

Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] and $x \in X$ a point. Then a _tangent vector_ on $X$ at $x$ is an [[equivalence class]] of the the tangency equivalence relation (def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves}, lemma \ref{TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}).

The set of all tangent vectors at $x \in X$ is denoted $T_x X$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #LinearTangentSpace}
###### Lemma
**([[real vector space]] structure on [[tangent vectors]])**

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and $x \in X$ any point,  let $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U \subset X$ be a [[chart]] with $x \in U \subset X$.

Then there is induced a [[bijection]] of sets

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}  T_x X
$$

from the $n$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] to the set of tangent vectors at $x$ (def. \ref{TangentVector}) given by sending $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to the equivalence class of the following differentiable curve:

$$
  \array{
    \gamma^\phi_{\vec v}
    &
    \mathbb{R}^1
      &\overset{ (-)\cdot \vec v }{\longrightarrow}&
   \mathbb{R}^n
      &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}&
    U_i
    \subset X
    \\
    &
    t
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    t \vec v
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    \phi(\phi^{-1}(x) + t \vec v)
  }
  \,.
$$

For $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi'}{\longrightarrow} U' \subset X$
another chart with $x \in U' \subset X$, then the linear isomorphism relating these two identifications is
the [[derivative]]

$$
  d \left((\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi  \right)_{ \phi^{-1}(x) }
  \in
  GL(n,\mathbb{R})
$$

of the [[gluing function]] of the two charts at the point $x$:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n
    &&
    \overset{
       d \left((\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi\right) (x)}{\longrightarrow} &&
    \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    && T_x X
  }
  \,.
$$

This is also called the _[[transition function]]_ between the two local identifications of the tangent space.

If $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$
is an [[atlas]] of the [[differentiable manifold]] $X$, then the transition functions

$$
  \left\{
    g_{i j}
    \coloneqq
    d( \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i )_{\phi^{-1}(-)}
    \colon
    U_i \cap U_j
      \longrightarrow
    GL(n,\mathbb{R})
  \right\}_{i,j \in I}
$$

defined this way satisfy the following [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] conditions for all $i,j \in I$, $x \in U_i \cap U_j$

1. $g_{i i}(x) = id_{\mathbb{R}^n}$;

1. $g_{j k}\circ g_{i j}(x) = g_{i k}(x)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The bijectivity of the map is immediate from the fact that the first derivative of $\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma^\phi_{\vec v}$
at $\phi^{-1}(x)$ is $\vec v$.

The formula for the transition function now follows with the [[chain rule]]:

$$
  d \left( (\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi( \phi^{-1}(x)  (-) \vec v )   \right)_0
  =
  d \left( (\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi \right)_{\phi^{-1}(x)} \circ \underset{ \vec v }{\underbrace{ d ( \phi^{-1}(x) +(-)\vec v )_0 }}
  \,.
$$

Similarly the Cech cocycle condition follows by the [[chain rule]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g_{j k} \circ g_{i j}(x)
     & =
    d( \phi_k^{-1} \circ \phi_j )_{\phi_j^{-1}(x)}
    \circ
    d( \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i )_{\phi_i^{-1}(x)}
    \\
    & =
    d( \phi_k^{-1} \circ \phi_j \circ \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i )_{\phi_i^{-1}(x)}
    \\
    & =
    d( \phi_k^{-1} \circ \phi_i )_{\phi_i^{-1}(x)}
    \\
    &=
    g_{i k}(x)

###### Definition
**([[tangent space]])**

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]] and $x \in X$ a point, then the _[[tangent space]]_ of $X$ at $x$ is the set $T_x X$ of [[tangent vectors]] at $x$ (def. \ref{TangentVector}) regarded as a [[real vector space]] via lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #EuclideanSpaceTangentBundle}
###### Example
**([[tangent bundle]] of [[Euclidean space]])

If $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ is itself a [[Euclidean space]], then
for any two points $x,y \in X$ the [[tangent spaces]] $T_x X$ and $T_y X$ (def. \ref{TangentSpace})
are canonically identified with each other:

Using the [[vector space]] (or just [[affine space]]) structure of $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ we may send every
smooth function $\gamma \colon \mathbb{R} \to X$ to the smooth function

$$
  \gamma' \colon t \mapsto \gamma(t) + (x-y)
  \,.
$$

This gives a linear bijection

$$
  \phi_{x,y} \colon T_x X \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} T_y X
$$

and these linear bijections are compatible, in that for $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}^n$ any three points,
then

$$
  \phi_{y,z} \circ \phi_{x,y} = \phi_{x,z} \;\colon\; T_x X \longrightarrow T_y Y
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}, each tangent space is identified with $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself,
and this identification in turn is compatible with all the above identifications:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    T_x X && \underoverset{\phi_{x,y}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} && T_y Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore it makes sense to canonically identify all the tangent spaces of Euclidean space with that Euclidean space
itself. As a result, the collection of all the tangent spaces of Euclidean space is naturally identified
with the [[Cartesian product]]

$$
  T \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n
$$

equipped with the [[projection]] on the first factor

$$
  \array{
    T \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi = pr_1}}
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^n
  }
  \,,
$$

because then the [[pre-image]] of a [[singleton]] $\{x\} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ under this projection are
canonically identified with the above tangent spaces:

$$
  \pi^{-1}(\{x\}) \simeq T_x \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

This way, if we equip $T \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with the [[product space|product space topology]],
then  $T \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n$ becomes a [[trivial vector bundle|trivial]] [[topological vector bundle]].

This is called the _[[tangent bundle]]_ of the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ regarded as a [[differentiable manifold]].

**([[chain rule]] is [[functor|functoriality]] of [[tangent space]] construction on [[Euclidean spaces]])**

Consider the assignment that sends

1. every [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ to its [[tangent bundle]] $T \mathbb{R}^n$ according to def. \ref{EuclideanSpaceTangentBundle};

1. every [[differentiable function]] $f \colon \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ to the
   function on [[tangent vectors]] (def. \ref{TangentVector}) induced by postcomposition with $f$

   $$
     \array{
       T \mathbb{R}^{n_1}
         &\overset{f \circ (-)}{\longrightarrow}&
       T \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
       \\
       \left[
         \mathbb{R}^1
           \overset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}
         \mathbb{R}^{n_1}

         &\mapsto&
       \left[
         \mathbb{R}^1
           \overset{ f \circ \gamma}{\longrightarrow}
         \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
       \right]
     }
   $$

By the [[chain rule]] we have that the [[derivative]] of the composite curve $f \circ \gamma$ is

$$
  d (f \circ \gamma)_t
  =
  (d f_{\gamma(x)}) \circ d\gamma
$$

and hence that under the identification $T \mathbb{R}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ of example \ref{EuclideanSpaceTangentBundle}
this assignment takes $f$ to its [[derivative]]

   $$
     \array{
       \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_1}
         &\overset{ d f )}{\longrightarrow}&
       \mathbb{R}^{n_2} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
       \\
       (x,\vec v)
         &\mapsto&
       (f(x), d f_x(\vec v))
     }
     \,,
   $$

Conversely, in the first form above the assignment $f \mapsto f \circ (-)$ manifestly
respects [[composition]] (and [[identity functions]]). Viewed from the second perspective
this respect for composition is once again the [[chain rule]] $d(g \circ f) = (d f)\circ (d g)$:

$$
  \array{
    && Y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow  && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    X && \underset{ g\circ  f}{\longrightarrow} && Z
  }
  \phantom{AAA}

    \\
    T X &&  \underset{d(g \circ f)}{\longrightarrow} && T Z
  }
  \,.
$$

In the language of [[category theory]] this says that the assignment

$$
  \array{
    CartSp &\overset{T}{\longrightarrow}& CartSp
    \\
    X &\mapsto& T X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{ f }}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d f}}
    \\
    Y &\mapsto& T Y
  }
$$

is an [[endofunctor]] on the [[category]] [[CartSp]] whose

1. [[objects]] are the [[Euclidean spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. [[morphisms]] are the [[differentiable functions]] between these (for any chosen differentiability class $C^k$ with $k \gt 0$).

this is called the _tangent bundle_ of $X$.

Equivalently this means that the tangent bundle $T X$ is the [[topological vector bundle]] which
is glued (via [this example](topological+vector+bundle#TopologicalVectorBundleFromCechCocycle)) from the
[[transition functions]] $g_{i j} \coloneqq d(\phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i)_{\phi^{-1}(-)}$ from lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}:

$$

(Notice that, by examples \ref{EuclideanSpaceTangentBundle}, each $U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n \simeq T U_i$ is the tangent bundle
of the chart $U_i \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$.)

###### Lemma
**([[tangent bundle]] is [[differentiable vector bundle]])**

If $X$ is a $(p+1)$-times [[differentiable manifold]], then the total space
of the tangent bundle def. \ref{TangentBundle} is a $p$-times [[differentiable manifold]] in that

1. $(T X, \tau_{T X})$ is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]];

1. The [[gluing functions]] of the atlas $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{2n} \underoverset{\simeq}{d \phi_i}{\to} T U_i \subset  T X \right\}_{i \in I}$ are $p$-times continuously differentiable.

Moreover, the projection $\pi \colon T X \to X$ is a $p$-times continuously [[differentiable function]].

In summary this makes $T X \to X$ a _[[differentiable vector bundle]]_.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that $T X$ is Hausdorff:

Let $(x,\vec v), (x', \vec v') \in T X$ be two distinct points. We need to product
disjoint openneighbourhoods of these points in $T X$. Since in
particular $x,x' \in X$ are distinct, and since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open neighbourhoods
$U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_{x'} \supset \{x'\}$. Their pre-images $\pi^{-1}(U_x)$ and $\pi^{-1}(U_{x'})$
are disjoint open neighbourhoods of $(x,\vec v)$ and $(x',\vect v')$, respectively.

Now to see that $T X$ is paracompact.

Let $\{U_i \subset T X\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover. We need to find a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]]
[[refinement]]. Notice that $\pi \colon T X \to X$ is an [[open map]] (by [this example](open+map#ProjectionsAreOpenContinuousFunctions))
so that $\{\pi(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $X$.

Let now $\{\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_j}{\to} V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ be an [[atlas]] for $X$ and consider the
open common refinement

$$
  \left\{ \pi(U_i) \cap V_j \subset X  \right\}_{i \in I, j \in J}
  \,.
$$

Since this is still an open cover of $X$ and since $X$ is paracompact, this has a locally finite refinement

$$
  \left\{ V'_{j'} \subset X\right\}_{j' \in J'}
$$

Notice that for each $j' \in J'$ the product topological space $V'_{j'} \times \mathbb{R}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$
is paracompact (as a [[topological subspace]] of [[Euclidean space]] it is itself [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]
and [[second countable topological space|second countable]]
and since [[locally compact and second-countable spaces are paracompact]], lemma \ref{SigmaCompactFromLocallyCompactAndSecondCountable}).
Therefore the cover

  \{ \pi^{-1}(V'_{j'}) \cap U_i \subset V'_{j'} \times \mathbb{R}^n \}_{(i,j') \in I \times J'}
$$

has a locally finite refinement

$$
  \{W_{k_{j'}} \subset V'_{j'} \times \mathbb{R}^n \}_{k_{j'} \in K_{j'}}
  \,.
$$

We claim now that

$$
  \{ W_{k_{j'}}  \subset T X \}_{j' \in J',  k_{j'} \in K_{j'}}
$$

is a locally finite refinement of the original cover.
That this is an open cover refining the original one is clear. We need to see that it is locally finite.

So let $(x,\vec v) \in T X$. By local finiteness of $\{ V'_{j'}  \subset X\}_{j' \in J'}$ there is an open neighbourhood
$V_x \supset \{x\}$ which intersects only finitely many of the $V'_{j'} \subset X$.
Then by local finiteness of $\{ W_{k_{j'}}  \subset V'_{j_'}\}$, for each such $j'$ the point $(x,\vec v)$
regarded in $V'_{j'} \times \mathbb{R}^n$ has an open neighbourhood $U_{j'}$ that intersects only finitely many of the $W_{k_{j'}}$. Hence the
intersection $\pi^{-1}(V_x) \cap \left( \underset{j'}{\cap}  U_{j'} \right)$ is a finite intersection of open subsets, hence still open,
and by construction it intersects still only a finite number of the $W_{k_{j'}}$.

This shows that $T X$ is paracompact.

Finally the statement about the differentiability of the glung functions and of the projections is immediate from the definitions

###### Proposition
**([[differentials]] of [[differentiable functions]] between [[differentiable manifolds]])**

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[differentiable manifolds]] and let $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[differentiable function]]. Then the operation of postcomposition which takes differentiable curves in $X$ to differentiable curves in $Y$

$$
  \array{
     Hom_{Diff}(\mathbb{R}^1, X)
       &\overset{f \circ (-)}{\longrightarrow}&
     Hom_{Diff}(\mathbb{R}^1, Y)

       \mathbb{R}^1 \overset{\gamma}{\to} X
     \right)
     &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
     \left(
       \mathbb{R}^1 \overset{f \circ \gamma}{\to} Y
     \right)
  }
$$

descends at each point $x \in X$ to the tangency [[equivalence relation]] (def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves}, lemma \ref{TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}) to yield a function on
sets of [[tangent vectors]] (def. \ref{TangentVector}), called the _[[differential]]_ $d f_x$ of $f$ at $x$

$$
  d f|_{x}
    \;\colon\;
  T_x X
   \longrightarrow
  T_{f(x)} Y
  \,.
$$

Moreover:

1. ([[linear function|linear dependence]] on the tangent vector) these differentials are [[linear functions]] with respect to the vector space structure on the [[tangent spaces]] from lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}, def. \ref{TangentSpace};

1. ([[differentiable function|differentiable dependence]] on the base point) globally they
yield a [[homomorphism]] of real [[differentiable vector bundles]]  between the [[tangent bundles]] (def. \ref{TangentBundle}, lemma \ref{DifferentiableTangentBundle}), called the global _[[differential]]_ $d f$ of $f$

   $$
     d f \;\colon\; T X \longrightarrow T Y
     \,.
   $$

1. ([[chain rule]]) The assignment $f \mapsto d f$ respects [[composition]] in that for $X$, $Y$, $Z$ three [[differentiable manifolds]] and for

   $$
     X
       \overset{\phantom{A}f\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     Y
       \overset{\phantom{A}g\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     Z
   $$

   two [[composition|composable]] [[differentiable functions]] then their [[differentials]] satisfy

     d(g \circ f) = (d g) \circ (d f)

###### Definition
**([[vector field]])**

Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] with differentiable tangent bundle $T X \to X$ (def. \ref{TangentBundle}).

A differentiable [[section]] $v \colon X \to T X$ of the tangent bundle is called a (differentiable)
_[[vector field]]_ on $X$.

+-- {: .num_remark #AlgebraicDefinition}
###### Remark
**([[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]])**

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and write $C^\infty(X)$ for the [[associative algebra]] over the [[real numbers]]
of  [[smooth functions]] $X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

Then every smooth [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma_X(T X)$ (def. \ref{VectorField}) induces a [[function]]


$$
  \partial_v
    \;\colon\;
  C^\infty(X) \longrightarrow C^\infty(X)
$$

by

$$
  \partial f \;\colon\; x \mapsto \frac{d}{d t} (f \circ \gamma_{v_x})_0
$$

where $\gamma_{v_x} \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \to X$ is a smooth curve which represents the [[tangent vector]] $v(x) \in T_x X$
according to def. \ref{TangentVector}.

The linearity of [[derivatives]] and the [[product rule]] of [[differentiation]]
imply that this function $\partial_v$ is a [[derivation]] on the algebra of smooth functions. Hence there is a function

$$
  \array{
    \Gamma_X(T X)
      &\longrightarrow&
    Def(C^\infty(X))
    \\
    v &\mapsto& \partial_v
  }
  \,.
$$

It turns out that this function is in fact a [[bijection]]: every derivation of the algebra of smooth functions
on a smooth manifold arises uniquely from a smooth tangent vector in this way.

For more on this see at _[[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]]_.



=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(notation for tangent vectors in a chart)**

Under the bijection of lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace} one often denotes the tangent vector  corresponding to the the $i$-th canonical [[linear basis|basis]] vector of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \phantom{AA} \text{or just } \phantom{AA}
  \partial_i
$$

because under the identification of tangent vectors with [[derivations]] on the algebra of [[differentiable functions]] on $X$ as [above](#AlgebraicDefinition) then it acts as the operation of taking the $i$th [[partial derivative]]. The general tangent vector corresponding to $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is then denoted by

$$
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
  v^i
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \phantom{AA} \text{or just } \phantom{AA}
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum} v^i \partial_i
  \,.
$$


Notice that this identification depends on the choice of [[chart]], which is left implicit in this notation.

Sometimes, notably in texts on [[thermodynamics]], one augments this notation to indicate the chart being used by listing the remaining coordinate functions as subscripts. For instance if two functions $f,g$ on a 2-dimensional manifold are used as coordinate functions for a local chart (i.e. so that $x^1 = f$ and $x^2 = g$ ), then one writes

$$
  (\partial/\partial f)_g
  \phantom{AA}
  (\partial/\partial g)_f
$$

for the tangent vectors $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}$, respectively.

Consider an immersion $f \;\colon\; (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of an [[open interval]] into the [[Euclidean plane]] (or the [[2-sphere]]) as shown on the right. This is not a [[embedding of smooth manifolds]]: around the points where the image crosses itself, the function is not even injective, but even
a#t the points where it just touches itself, the pre-images under $f$ of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ do not exhaust the open subsets of $(a,b)$, hence do not yield the [[subspace topology]].

As a concrete examples, consider the function  $(sin(2-), sin(-)) \;\colon\; (-\pi, \pi) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$. While this is an immersion and [[injective]], it fails to be an embedding due to the points at $t = \pm \pi$ "touching" the point at $t = 0$.

###### Proposition
**(proper injective immersions are equivalently the closed embeddings)**

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[smooth manifolds]], and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a [[smooth function]]. Then the following are equivalent

1. $f$ is a [[proper map|proper]] [[injective function|injective]]  [[immersion]];

1. $f$ is a closed embedding (def. \ref{SmoothManifoldsEmbedding}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since topological manifolds are [[locally compact topological spaces]] (prop. \ref{LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace}),
this follows directly since [[injective proper maps into locally compact spaces are equivalently closed embeddings]] by prop. \ref{InjectiveProperMapsAreEquivalentlyTheClosedEmbeddings}.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #CompactManifoldEmbedsIntoLargeDimensionalEuclideanSpace}
###### Proposition

For every [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] $X$ (of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]]), there exists some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $X$ has an embedding (def. \ref{SmoothManifoldsEmbedding}) into the [[Euclidean space]] of dimension $k$:

$$
  X \overset{\text{embd}}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^k
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let

$$
  \{\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}
$$

be an [[atlas]] exhibiting the [[smooth structure]] of $X$. In particular this is an [[open cover]], and hence by compactness there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that

$$
  \{\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}
$$

is still an open cover.

Since $X$ is a [[smooth manifold]], there exists a [[partition of unity]] $\{f_i \in C^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})\}_{i \in J }$ subordinate to this cover with _[[smooth functions]]_ $f_i$ (by [this prop.](partition+of+unity#SmoothManifoldAdmitsSmoothPartitionsOfUnity)).

This we may use to extend the inverse [[chart]] identifications

$$
  X \supset \;\; U_i \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_i}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n
$$

to smooth functions

$$
  \hat \psi_i \;\colon\; X \to \mathbb{R}^{n}
$$

by setting

$$
  \hat \phi_i
  \;\colon\;
   x
  \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
       f_i(x) \cdot \psi_i(x) &\vert& x \in U_i \subset X
       \\
       0 &\vert& \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

The idea now is to combine all these functions to obtain an injective function

$$
  (\hat \psi_i)_{i \in J}
  \;\colon\;
  X \longrightarrow (\mathbb{R}^n)^{\vert J\vert }
  \simeq
  \mathbb{R}^{n \cdot {\vert J \vert }}
  \,.
$$

But while this is injective, it need not be an [[immersion]], since the [[derivatives]] of the product functions $f_i \cdot \psi_i$ may vanish, even though the derivatives of the two factors do not vanish separately. However this is readily fixed by adding yet more ambient coordinates and considering the function

$$
  (\hat \psi_i, f_i)_{i \in I}
  \;\colon\;
  X
    \longrightarrow
  \left(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})\right)^{\vert J \vert}
  \simeq
  \mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\cdot {\vert J \vert}}
  \,.
$$

This is an immersion. Hence it remains to see that it is also an [[embedding of topological spaces]].

By [this prop](embedding+of+topological+spaces#OpenClosedContinuousInjectionsAreEmbeddings) it is sufficient to see that the injective continuous function is a [[closed map]]. But this follows generally since $X$ is a [[compact topological space]] by assumption, and since $Y$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] by definition of manifolds, and since [[maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper]].
