This page is a detailed introduction to basic [[topology]].
Starting from scratch (required background is just a basic concept of _[[sets]]_), and amplifying motivation from [[analysis]],
it first develops standard [[point-set topology]] ([[topological spaces]]).
In passing, some basics of [[category theory]] make an informal appearance,
used to transparently summarize some conceptually important aspects of the theory, such as
[[initial topology|initial]] and [[final topologies]] and the [[reflective subcategory|reflection]] into
[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[sober topological spaces]].
The second part introduces some basics of [[homotopy theory]], mostly the [[fundamental group]],
and ends with their first application to the classification of [[covering spaces]].

The idea of _[[topology]]_ is to study "[[spaces]]" with "[[continuous functions]]" between them.
Specifically one considers [[functions]] between [[sets]] (whence "[[point-set topology]]", see [below](#PointSetTopology))
such that there is a concept for what it means that these functions depend
continuously on their arguments, in that that their values do not "jump".
Such a concept of [[continuous function|continuity]] is familiar from [[analysis]] on [[metric spaces]],
(recalled [below](#Continuity)) but the definition in topology generalizes this analytic concept
and renders it more foundational, generalizing the concept of [[metric spaces]] to that of _[[topological spaces]]_.
(def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} below).

Hence [[topology]] is the study of the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]], and whose
[[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] (see also remark \ref{TopCategory} below).
This category is much more flexible than that of [[metric spaces]], for example it admits the construction of
arbitrary [[quotients]] and [[intersections]] of spaces.
Accordingly, topology underlies or informs many and diverse areas of mathematics, such as
[[functional analysis]], [[operator algebra]], [[manifold]]/[[scheme]] theory, hence [[algebraic geometry]] and [[differential geometry]],
and the study of [[topological groups]], [[topological vector spaces]], [[local  rings]], etc.. Not the least, it gives rise to
the field of [[homotopy theory]], where one considers also continuous deformations of continuous functions themselves ("[[homotopies]]").
Topology itself has many branches,
such as _[[low-dimensional topology]]_ or _[[topological domain theory]]_.

A popular imagery for the concept of a [[continuous function]] is provided by deformations of [[elasticity|elastic]]
physical bodies, which may be deformed by stretching them without tearing. The canonical illustration is
a continous [[bijection|bijective]] function from the [[torus]] to the surface of a coffee mug, which maps half of the torus to the
handle of the coffee mug, and continuously deforms parts of the other half in order to form the actual cup.
Since the [[inverse function]] to this function is itself continuous,
the torus and the coffee mug, both regarded as [[topological spaces]], are "[[isomorphism|the same]]"
for the purposes of [[topology]], one says they are _[[homeomorphic]]_.

On the other hand, there is _no_ [[homeomorphism]] from the [[torus]] to, for instance, the [[sphere]], signifying that these
represent two topologically distinct spaces. Part of topology is concerned with studying [[homeomorphism]]-[[invariants]]
of topological spaces which allow to detect by means of [[algebra|algebraic]] manipulations
whether two topological spaces are homeomorphic
(or more generally [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]]). This is called _[[algebraic topology]]_.
A basic algebraic invariant is the [[fundamental group]] of a topological space (discussed [below](#FundamentalGroups)),
which measures how many ways there are to wind loops inside a topological space.

Beware that the popular imagery of "[[rubber-sheet geometry]]" only captures part of the full scope of topology,
in that it invokes spaces that _locally_ still look like [[metric spaces]].
But the concept of topological spaces is a good bit more general.
Notably [[finite topological spaces]] are either [[discrete topological space|discrete]] or very much unlike
[[metric spaces]] (example \ref{FiniteT1SpacesAreDiscrete} below), they play a role in [[categorical logic]]. Also in [[geometry]] exotic topological spaces frequently arise when  forming non-free [[quotients]].
In order to gauge just how many of such "exotic" examples of topological  spaces beyond locally [[metric spaces]] one wishes
to admit in the theory,
extra "[[separation axioms]]" are imposed on topological spaces (see [below](#SeparationAxioms)), and the flavour of topology as a field
depends on this choice.

Among the separation axioms, the _[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff space]]_ axiom is most popular
(see [below](#TnTopologicalSpaces)) the weaker axiom of [[sober topological space|soberity]] (see [below](#SoberSpaces)) stands out, on the one
hand because this is the weakest axiom that is still naturally satisfied in applications to [[algebraic geometry]] ([[schemes are sober]])
and [[computer science]] ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)) and on the other hand because it fully realizes the strong roots that
topology has in [[formal logic]]: [[sober topological spaces]] are entirely characterized by the
union-, intersection- and inclusion-relations
(logical [[conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[implication]]) among their [[open subsets]] ([[propositions]]).
This leads to a natural
and fruitful generalization of [[topology]] to more general "purely logic-determined spaces", called _[[locales]]_
and in yet more generality _[[toposes]]_ and _[[higher topos theory|higher toposes]]_. While the latter are beyond
the scope of this introduction, their rich theory and relation to the [[foundations]] of mathematics and geometry
provides an outlook on the relevance of the basic ideas of [[topology]].


$\,$



In this first part we discuss the foundations of the concept of "sets equipped with topology"
([[topological spaces]]) and of [[continuous functions]] between them.


## Metric spaces
 {#Continuity}

The concept of continuity was first made precise  in [[analysis]], in terms of [[epsilontic analysis]] on [[metric spaces]], recalled as def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} below. Then it was realized that this has a more elegant formulation in terms of the more general concept of _[[open sets]]_, this is prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets} below. Adopting the latter as the definition leads to a more abstract concept of "continuous space", this is the concept of _[[topological spaces]]_, def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} below.

Here we briefly recall the relevant basic concepts from [[analysis]], as a motivation for various definitions in
[[topology]]. The reader who either already recalls these concepts in analysis
or is content with ignoring the motivation coming from analysis should skip right away to the section _[Topological spaces](#TopologicalSpaces)_.

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpace}
###### Definition
**(metric space)**

A _[[metric space]]_ is

1. a [[set]] $X$ (the "underlying set");

1. a [[function]] $d \;\colon\; X \times X \to [0,\infty)$ (the "distance function") from the [[Cartesian product]] of the set with itself to the [[nonnegative number|non-negative]] [[real numbers]]

such that for all $x,y,z \in X$:

1. (symmetry) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$

1. ([[triangle inequality]]) $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y)+ d(y,z)$.

1. (non-degeneracy) $d(x,y) = 0 \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\; x = y$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #OpenBalls}
###### Definition

Let $(X,d)$, be a [[metric space]]. Then for every element $x \in X$ and every  $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_+$ a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], we write

$$
  B^\circ_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) \lt \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the [[open ball]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$. Similarly we write

$$
  B_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) \leq \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the _closed ball_ of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$. Finally we write

$$
  S_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) = \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the [[sphere]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$.

For $\epsilon = 1$ we also speak of the _unit open/closed ball_ and the _unit sphere_.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}
###### Definition

For $(X,d)$ a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) then a [[subset]] $S \subset X$
is called a _[[bounded subset]]_ if $S$ is contained in some [[open ball]] (def. \ref{OpenBalls})

$$
  S \subset B^\circ_x(r)
$$

around some $x \in X$ of some [[radius]] $r \in \mathbb{R}$.

A key source of metric spaces are [[norm|normed]] _[[vector spaces]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #NormedVectorSpace}
###### Dedfinition
**(normed vector space)**

A _[[normed vector space]]_ is

1. a [[real vector space]] $V$;

1. a [[function]] (the _[[norm]]_)

   $$
     {\Vert {-} \Vert} \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}
   $$

   from the underlying [[set]] of $V$ to the [[non-negative number|non-negative]] [[real numbers]],

such that for all $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with [[absolute value]] ${\vert c \vert}$ and all $v , w \in V$ it holds true that

1. (linearity) ${\Vert c v \Vert} = {\vert c \vert} {\Vert v \Vert }$;

1. ([[triangle inequality]]) ${\Vert v+w \Vert} \leq {\Vert v \Vert } + {\Vert w \Vert}$;

1. (non-degeneracy) if ${\Vert v \Vert} = 0$ then $v = 0$.

+-- {: .num_prop #MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace}
###### Proposition

Every [[normed vector space]] $(V, {\Vert {-} \Vert})$
becomes a [[metric space]] according to def. \ref{MetricSpace} by setting

$$
  d(x,y) \coloneqq {\Vert x-y \Vert}
  \,.
$$

=--

Examples of [[normed vector spaces]] (def. \ref{NormedVectorSpace}) and hence, via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace},
of [[metric spaces]] include the following:

+-- {: .num_example #EuclideanNorm}
###### Example

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[Cartesian space]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n
    =
   \left\{
     \vec x
     =
     (x_i)_{i = 1}^n
     \vert
      x_i \in \mathbb{R}
   \right\}
$$

carries a [[norm]] (the _Euclidean norm_ ) given by the [[square root]] of the [[sum]] of the [[squares]] of the components:

   $$
     {\Vert \vec x \Vert}
       \;\coloneqq\;
     \sqrt{
     \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
       (x_i)^2
     }
     \,.
   $$

Via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace} this gives $\mathbb{R}^n$ the structure of a
[[metric space]], and as such it is called the _[[Euclidean space]]_ of [[dimension]] $n$.

</div>

More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $p \in \mathbb{R}$, $p \geq 1$, then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ carries the _[[p-norm]]_

   $$
     {\Vert \vec x \Vert}_p  \coloneqq \root p {\sum_i {|x_i|^p}}
   $$

One also sets

$$
  {\Vert \vec x \Vert}_\infty \coloneqq \underset{i \in I}{max} \, {\vert x_i \vert}
$$

and calls this the _[[supremum norm]]_.

The graphics on the right (grabbed from Wikipedia) shows unit circles (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to various [[p-norms]].

By the [[Minkowski inequality]],
the [[p-norm]] generalizes to non-[[finite dimensional vector spaces]] such as [[sequence spaces]] and [[Lebesgue spaces]].

### Continuity
 {#ContinuityInAnalysis}

The following is now the fairly obvious definition of continuity for functions between metric spaces.

For $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ two [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), then a [[function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is said to be _continuous at a point $x \in X$_ if for
every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon$
there exists a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\delta$ such that
for all $x' \in X$ that are a [[distance]] smaller than $\delta$ from $x$ then their image $f(x')$
is a distance smaller than $\epsilon$ from $f(x)$:

$$
  \left(
    f\,\, \text{continuous at}\, x
  \right)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{{\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}} \atop {\epsilon \gt 0}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \underset{{\delta \in \mathbb{R}} \atop {\delta \gt 0}}{\exists}
      \left(
        \left(
          d_X(x,x') \lt \delta
        \right)
           \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
        \left(
          d_Y(\,f(x), f(x')\,) \lt \epsilon
        \right)
      \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The function $f$ is said to be _continuous_ if it is continuous at every point $x \in X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #PolynoialsAreContinuous}
###### Example
**([[polynomials are continuous functions]])**

Consider the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as the
1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}$ from example \ref{EuclideanNorm}.

For $P \in \mathbb{R}[X]$ a [[polynomial]], then the function

$$
  \array{
    f_P &\colon& \mathbb{R} &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& P(x)
  }
$$

is a [[continuous function]] in the sense of def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity}.

Similarly for instance

* forming the [[square root]] is a continuous function $\sqrt(-) \colon \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$;

* forming the multiplicativ inverse is a continuous function $1/(-) \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}$.

=--

On the other hand, a [[step function]] is continuous everywhere except at the [[finite number]] of points
at which it changes its value, see example \ref{StepFunction} below.


We now reformulate the analytic concept of continuity from def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} in terms of the simple but important concept of _[[open sets]]_:


+-- {: .num_defn #OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}
###### Definition
**(neighbourhood and open set)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}). Say that:

1. A _[[neighbourhood]]_ of a point $x \in X$ is a [[subset]] $U_x \subset X$ which contains some [[open ball]] $B_x^\circ(\epsilon) \subset U_x$ around $x$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}).

1. An _[[open subset]]_ of $X$ is a [[subset]] $U \subset X$ such that for every $x \in U$ it also contains an [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ around $x$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}).

1. An _[[open neighbourhood]]_ of a point $x \in X$ is a [[neighbourhood]] $U_x$ of $x$ which is also an open subset, hence equivalently this is any open subset of $X$ that contains $x$.

=--


The following picture shows a point $x$, some [[open balls]] $B_i$ containing it, and two of its [[neighbourhoods]] $U_i$:

+-- {: .num_example #OpenEmptySet}
###### Example
**(the empty subset is open)**

Notice that for $(X,d)$ a [[metric space]], then the [[empty set|empty]] [[subset]] $\emptyset \subset X$
is always an [[open subset]] of $(X,d)$ according to def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}.
This is because the clause for open subsets $U \subset X$ says that "for every point $x \in U$ there exists...",
but since there is no $x$ in $U = \emptyset$, this clause is always satisfied in this case.

Conversely, the entire set $X$ is always an open subset of $(X,d)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #OpenAndClosedIntervals}
###### Example
**(open/closed [[intervals]])**

Regard the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

For $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the following [[subsets]]:

1. $(a,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x \lt b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*open interval*)

1. $(a,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x \leq b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*half-open interval*)

1. $[a,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x \lt b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*half-open interval*)

1. $[a,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x \leq b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*closed interval*)

The first of these is an open subset according to def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}, the other three are not.
The first one is called an _[[open interval]]_, the last one a _[[closed interval]]_
and the middle two are called _[[half-open intervals]]_.

Similarly for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ one considers

1. $(-\infty,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert x \lt b  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*unbounded open interval*)

1. $(a,\infty) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ $\,\,$ (*unbounded open interval*)

1. $(-\infty,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert x \leq b  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (*unbounded half-open interval*)

1. $[a,\infty) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x  \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ $\,\,$ (*unbounded half-open interval*)

The first two of these are open subsets, the last two are not.

For completeness we may also consider

* $(-\infty , \infty) = \mathbb{R}$

* $(a,a) = \emptyset$

which are both open, according to def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}.

=--

We may now rephrase the analytic definition of continuity entirely in terms of open subsets (def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}):

+-- {: .num_prop #ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets}
###### Proposition
**(rephrasing continuity in terms of open sets)**

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be two [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}).
Then a [[function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] in the [[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] sense of def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} precisely if it has the property that its [[pre-images]] of [[open subsets]] of $Y$ (in the sense of def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}) are open subsets of $X$:

$$
  \left(
    f \,\, \text{continuous}

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe, by direct unwinding the definitions,
that the epsilontic definition of continuity (def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity}) says equivalently in
terms of [[open balls]] (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) that
$f$ is continous at $x$ precisely if for every open ball $B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)$ around an image
point, there exists an open ball $B^\circ_x(\delta)$ around the corresponding pre-image
point which maps into it:

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      f \,\,\text{continuous at}\,\, x
    \right)
    & \Leftrightarrow \;
    \underset{\epsilon \gt 0}{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{\delta \gt 0}{\exists}
      \left(
        f(\;B_x^\circ(\delta)\;) \;\subset\; B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)
      \right)
    \right)
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow \;
    \underset{\epsilon \gt 0}{\forall}
    \left(
      \underset{\delta \gt 0}{\exists}
      \left(
        B^\circ_x(\delta) \subset f^{-1}\left( B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon) \right)
      \right)
    \right)
  }
  \,.
$$

With this observation the proof immediate. For the record, we spell it out:

First assume that $f$ is continuous in the epsilontic sense. Then for $O_Y \subset Y$ any [[open subset]] and $x \in f^{-1}(O_Y)$ any point in the pre-image, we need to show that there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] of $x$ in $f^{-1}(O_Y)$.

That $O_Y$ is open in $Y$ means by definition that there exists an [[open ball]] $B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)$ in $O_Y$ around $f(x)$
for some radius $\epsilon$. By the assumption that $f$ is continuous and using the above observation, this implies that there exists an
open ball $B^\circ_x(\delta)$ in $X$ such that $f(B^\circ_x(\delta)) \subset B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon) \subset Y$,
hence such that $B^\circ_x(\delta) \subset f^{-1}\left(B^{\circ}_{f(x)}(\epsilon)\right) \subset f^{-1}(O_Y)$.
Hence this is an open ball of the required kind.

Conversely, assume that the pre-image function $f^{-1}$ takes open subsets to open subsets. Then for every $x \in X$ and $B_{f(x)}^\circ(\epsilon) \subset Y$ an [[open ball]] around its image, we need to produce an open ball $B_x^\circ(\delta) \subset X$ around $x$
such that $f(B_x^\circ(\delta)) \subset B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)$.

But by definition of open subsets, $B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon) \subset Y$ is open, and therefore by assumption on $f$
its pre-image $f^{-1}(B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)) \subset X$ is also an open subset of $X$. Again by definition of
open subsets, this implies that it contains an open ball as required.

       (-\infty, 0] & \vert \, a \lt 0 \;\;\text{and}\;\; b \leq 1

$$

By example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}, all except the last of these pre-images listed are open subsets.

The failure of the last of the pre-images to be open
witnesses that the step function is not continuous at $x = 0$.

### Compactness
 {#CompactMetricSpaces}

A key application of [[metric spaces]] in [[analysis]] is that they allow a formalization of what it means
for an infinite [[sequence]] of elements in the metric space (def. \ref{Sequences} below)
to _[[convergence|converge]]_ to a _[[limit of a sequence]]_ (def. \ref{Convergence} below).
Of particular interest are therefore those metric spaces for which each sequence has a converging subsequence:
the _[[sequentially compact metric spaces]]_ (def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}).

We now briefly recall these concepts from [[analysis]]. Then, in the above spirit, we reformulate
their epsilontic definition in terms of [[open subsets]].
This gives a useful definition that generalizes to [[topological spaces]], the _[[compact topological spaces]]_
discussed further [below](#CompactSpaces).




+-- {: .num_defn #Sequences}
###### Definition
**([[sequence]])**

Given a [[set]] $X$, then a _[[sequence]]_ of elements in $X$ is a [[function]]

$$
  x_{(-)}
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{N}
    \longrightarrow
  X
$$

from the [[natural numbers]] to $X$.

A _[[sub-sequence]]_ of such a sequence is a sequence of the form

$$
  x_{\iota(-)}
   \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{N}
    \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow}
  \mathbb{N}
    \overset{x_{(-)}}{\longrightarrow}

for some [[injection]] $\iota$.

###### Definition
**([[convergence]] to [[limit of a sequence]])**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}).
Then a [[sequence]]

$$
  x_{(-)}
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{N}
    \longrightarrow
  X
$$

in the underlying set $X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}) is said to _[[convergence|converge]]_ to a point $x_\infty \in X$, denoted

$$
  x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
$$

if for every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon$, there exists a [[natural number]] $n$, such that
all elements in the sequence after the $n$th one have [[distance]] less than $\epsilon$ from $x_\infty$.

$$
  \left(
    x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
  \right)
   \,\Leftrightarrow\,
  \left(
    \underset{ {\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}}  \atop {\epsilon \gt 0} }{\forall}
    \left(
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
    \left(

    \;
    d(x_i, x_\infty) \leq \epsilon
    \right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Here the point $x_\infty$ is called the _[[limit of a sequence|limit of the sequence]]_.
Often one writes $\underset{i \to \infty}{\lim}x_i$ for this point.

$$

is called a _[[Cauchy sequence]]_ if for every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon$
there exists a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the [[distance]] between any two elements

A [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), for which every [[Cauchy sequence]] (def. \ref{CauchySequence})
[[convergence|converges]] (def. \ref{Convergence}) is called a _[[complete metric space]]_.

A [[normed vector space]], regarded as a metric space via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace} that
is complete in this sense is called a _[[Banach space]]_.

Finally recall the concept of _[[compactness]]_ of [[metric spaces]] via [[epsilontic analysis]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}
###### Definition
**([[sequentially compact metric space]])**

A [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) is called _[[sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]]_
if every [[sequence]] in $X$ has a subsequence (def. \ref{Sequences}) which [[convergence|converges]] (def. \ref{Convergence}).

=--

The key fact to translate this [[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] definition of compactness to a concept that
makes sense for general [[topological spaces]] ([below](#CompactSpaces)) is the following:

+-- {: .num_prop #CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
###### Proposition
**([[sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]])**

For a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is [[sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]];

1. for every [[set]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of [[open subsets]] $U_i$ of $X$ (def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace})
   which [[open cover|cover]] $X$ in that $X = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i$, then
   there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ of these open subsets which still covers
   $X$ in that also $X = \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} U_i$.

=--

The **proof** of prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
is most conveniently formulated with some of the terminology of topology in hand, which we introduce now.
Therefore we postpone the proof to [below](#ProofOfSequentiallyCompactMetricSpacesAreEquivCompact).


$\,$

In **summary** prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets} and prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
show that the purely combinatorial
and in particular non-[[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] concept of _[[open subsets]]_ captures a substantial part of the nature of
[[metric spaces]] in [[analysis]]. This motivates to reverse the logic and consider more general "[[spaces]]" which are
_only_ characterized by what counts as their open subsets. These are the _[[topological spaces]]_
which we turn to now in def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} (or, more generally, these are the "[[locales]]", which we briefly
consider below in remark \ref{Locales}).


$\,$




## Topological spaces
 {#TopologicalSpaces}

Due to prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets}
we should pay attention to [[open subsets]] in [[metric spaces]]. It turns out that the following closure
property, which follow directly from the definitions, is at the heart of the concept:


+-- {: .num_prop #OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties}
###### Proposition
**(closure properties of open sets in a metric space)**

The collection of [[open subsets]] of a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ as in def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} has the following properties:

1. The [[union]] of any [[set]] of open subsets is again an open subset.

1. The [[intersection]] of any [[finite number]] of open subsets is again an open subset.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #EmptyIntersection}
###### Remark
**(empty union and empty intersection)**

Notice the degenerate case of [[unions]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i$
and [[intersections]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_i$ of [[subsets]] $U_i \subset X$ for the case that they
are indexed by the [[empty set]] $I = \emptyset$:

1. the _empty union_ is the empty set itself;

1. the _empty intersection_ is all of $X$.

(The second of these may seem less obvious than the first. We discuss the general logic behind these kinds of phenomena [below](#UniversalConstructions).)

This way prop. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties}
is indeed compatible with the degenerate cases of examples of open subsets in example \ref{OpenEmptySet}.

=--


Proposition \ref{OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties} motivates
the following generalized definition, which abstracts away from the concept of [[metric space]]
just its system of [[open subsets]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**([[topological spaces]])**

Given a [[set]] $X$, then a _topology_ on $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ called the _[[open subsets]]_, hence a [[subset]] of the [[power set]] $P(X)$

$$
  \tau \subset P(X)
$$

such that this is closed under forming

1. finite [[intersections]];

1. arbitrary [[unions]].

In particular (by remark \ref{EmptyIntersection}):

* the [[empty set]] $\emptyset \subset X$ is in $\tau$ (being the union of no subsets)

and

* the whole set $X \subset X$ itself is in $\tau$ (being the intersection of no subsets).


A set $X$ equipped with such a [[topology]] is called a _[[topological space]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the field of [[topology]] it is common to eventually simply say "[[space]]" as shorthand for "[[topological space]]".
This is especially so as further qualifiers are added, such as "Hausdorff  space" (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace} below).
But beware that there are other kinds of [[spaces]] in mathematics.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The simple definition of [[open subsets]] in def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} and the simple
implementation of the _principle of continuity_ below in def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}
gives the field of [[topology]] its fundamental and universal flavor. The combinatorial nature of these definitions makes
[[topology]] be closely related to [[formal logic]]. This becomes more manifest still for the "[[sober topological space]]"
discussed [below](#SoberSpaces). For more on this perspective see the remark on _[[locales]]_ below, remark \ref{Locales}.
An introductory textbook amplifying this perspective is ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)).

=--

$\,$

Before we look at first examples [below](#TopologicalSpacesExamples),
here is some common **further terminology** regarding topological spaces:

There is an evident [[partial ordering]] on the set of topologies that a given set may carry:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologyFinerCoarser}
###### Definition
**([[finer topology|finer/coarser topologies]])**

Let $X$ be a [[set]], and let $\tau_1, \tau_2 \in P(X)$ be two [[topological space|topologies]] on $X$,
hence two choices of [[open subsets]] for $X$, making it a [[topological space]]. If

$$
  \tau_1 \subset \tau_2
$$

hence if every open subset of $X$ with respect to $\tau_1$ is also regarded as open by $\tau_2$, then
one says that

* the topology $\tau_2$ is _[[finer topology|finer]]_ than the topology $\tau_2$

* the topology $\tau_1$ is _[[coarser topology|coarser]]_ than the topology $\tau_1$.

=--

With any kind of [[mathematical structure|structure]] on [[sets]], it is of interest how to
"[[generators and relations|generate]]" such structures from a small amount of data:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologyBase}
###### Definition
**([[basis for the topology]])**

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], def. \ref{TopologicalSpace},
and let

$$
  \beta \subset \tau
$$

be a [[subset]] of its set of [[open subsets]]. We say that

1. $\beta$ is a _[[topological base|basis for the topology]]_ $\tau$ if every open subset $O \in \tau$ is a [[union]] of elements of $\beta$;

1. $\beta$ is a _[[topological base|sub-basis for the topology]]_ if every open subset $O \in \tau $ is a [[union]] of [[finitary intersections|finite intersections]] of elements of $\beta$.


=--

Often it is convenient to _define_ topologies by defining some (sub-)basis as in def. \ref{TopologyBase}. Examples are the
the [[metric topology]] below, example \ref{MetricTopology},
the [[product topological space|binary product topology]] in def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace} below,
and the [[compact-open topology]] on [[mapping spaces]] below in def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}.
To make use of this, we need to recognize sets of open subsets that serve as the basis for some topology:

+-- {: .num_lemma #RecognizingTopologicalBasis}
###### Lemma
**(recognition of topological bases)**

Let $X$ be a set.

1. A collection $\beta \subset P(X)$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ is a [[basis of a topology|basis]]
for some topology $\tau \subset P(X)$ (def. \ref{TopologyBase}) precisely if

   1. every point of $X$ is contained in at least one element of $\beta$;

   1. for every two subsets $B_1, B_2 \in \beta$ and for every point $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$ in their intersection, then there exists
   a $B \in \beta$ that contains $x$ and is contained in the intersection: $x \in B \subset B_1 \cap B_2$.

1. A subset $B \subset \tau$ of opens is a sub-basis for a topology $\tau$ on $X$ precisely if $\tau$ is the coarsest topology (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) which contains $B$.

### Examples
 {#TopologicalSpacesExamples}

We discuss here some basic examples of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}), to get a feeling for
the scope of the concept. But topological spaces are ubiquituous in [[mathematics]], so that there are many more examples
and many more classes of examples than could be listed. As we further develop the theory below, we encounter more examples,
and more classes of examples. Below in _[Universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions)_ we discuss a very general construction
principle of new topological space from  given ones.

First of all, our motivating example from [above](#Continuity) now reads as follows:

+-- {: .num_example #MetricTopology}
###### Example
**([[metric topology]])**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}). Then the collection of its [[open subsets]] in def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} constitutes a _[[topological space|topology]]_ on the set $X$, making it a _[[topological space]]_ in the sense of def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}. This is called the _[[metric topology]]_.

The [[open balls]] in a metric space constitute a [[basis of a topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase}) for the [[metric topology]].



=--



While the example of [[metric space]] topologies (example \ref{MetricTopology}) is the motivating example
for the concept of [[topological spaces]], it is important to notice that the concept
of topological spaces is considerably more general, as some of the following examples show.


The following simplistic example of a (metric) topological space is important for the theory
(for instance in prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub}):

+-- {: .num_example #Point}
###### Example
**([[empty space]] and [[point space]])**

On the [[empty set]] there exists a unique topology.
We write $\emptyset$ also for the resulting [[topological space]],
which we call the _[[empty topological space]]_.

On a [[singleton]] set $\{1\}$ there exists a unique topology $\tau$
making it a [[topological space]] according to def. \ref{TopologicalSpace},
namely

$$
  \tau
    \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \emptyset , \{1\}
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

We write

$$
  \ast
    \coloneqq
  \left(
    \left\{1\right\}, \tau \coloneqq \left\{ \emptyset, \left\{1\right\}\right\}
  \right)
$$

for this topological space and call it _the [[point topological space]]_.

This is equivalently the [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}) on $\mathbb{R}^0$,
regarded as the 0-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

=--

+-- {: .num_example #SierpinskiSpace}
###### Example

On the 2-element set $\{0,1\}$ there are (up to [[permutation]] of elements) three distinct topologies:

1. the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) $\tau = \left\{   \emptyset, \{0,1\}  \right\}$;

1. the _[[discrete topology]]_ (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}), $\tau = \left\{   \emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}  \right\}$;

1. the _[[Sierpinski space]]_ topology $\tau = \left\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\}  \right\}$.

+-- {: .num_example #CoDiscreteTopology}
###### Example
**(discrete and co-discrete topology)**

Let $S$ be any [[set]]. Then there are always the following two extreme
possibilities of equipping $X$ with a topology $\tau \subset P(X)$ in the sense of
def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}, and hence making it a [[topological space]]:

1. $\tau \coloneqq P(S)$ the set of _all_ open subsets;

   this is called the _[[discrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[finer topology|finest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$,

   we write $Disc(S)$ for the resulting topological space;

1. $\tau \coloneqq \{ \emptyset, S \}$ the set contaning only the [[empty set|empty]] subset of $S$ and all of $S$ itself;

   this is called the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[coarser topology|coarsest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$,

   we write $CoDisc(S)$ for the resulting topological space.

The reason for this terminology is best seen when considering [[continuous functions]] into or out of these (co-)discrete topological spaces, we come to this in example \ref{ContinuousFunctionsIntoCoDiscreteTopologicalSpaces} below.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #TopologyCofinite}
###### Example
**([[cofinite topology]])**

Given a [[set]] $X$, then the _[[cofinite topology]]_ or _finite complement topology_ on $X$ is the [[topological space|topology]]
(def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) whose [[open subsets]] are precisely

1. all [[cofinite subsets]] $S \subset X$ (i.e. those such that the [[complement]] $X \backslash S$ is a [[finite set]]);

1. the [[empty set]].

If $X$ is itself a [[finite set]] (but not otherwise) then the cofinite topology on $X$ coincides with the [[discrete topological space|discrete topology]] on $X$ (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}).

We now consider basic construction principles of new topological spaces from given ones:

1. [[disjoint union spaces]] (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces})

1. [[subspaces]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}),

1. [[quotient spaces]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

1. [[product spaces]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}).

Below in _[Universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions)_ we will recognize these
as simple special cases of a general construction principle.


+-- {: .num_example #DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Example
**([[disjoint union]])**

For $\{(X_i, \tau_i)\}_{i \in I}$ a [[set]] of topological spaces, then their _[[disjoint union]]_

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (X_i, \tau_i)
$$

is the topological space whose underlying set is the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying sets of the summand spaces,
and whose open subsets are precisely the disjoint unions of the open subsets of the summand spaces.

In particular, for $I$ any index set, then the disjoint union
of $I$ copies of the [[point space]] (example \ref{Point}) is equivalently the [[discrete topological space]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology})
on that index set:

Let $(X, \tau_X)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $S \subset X$ be a [[subset]] of the underlying set. Then the corresponding _[[topological subspace]]_ has $S$ as its underlying set, and its open subsets are those subsets of $S$ which arise as restrictions of open subsets of $X$.

$$
  R_\sim \subset X \times X
$$

be an [[equivalence relation]] on its underlying set. Then the _[[quotient topological space]]_  has

* as underlying set the [[quotient set]] $X/\sim$, hence the set of [[equivalence classes]],

and

* a subset $O \subset X/\sim$ is declared to be an [[open subset]] precisely if its [[preimage]] $\pi^{-1}(O)$ under the canonical [[projection map]]

  $$
    \pi \;\colon\; X \to X/\sim
  $$

  is open in $X$.

(This is also called the _[[final topology]]_ of the projection $\pi$. We come back to this below in def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}. )

Often one considers this with input datum not the equivalence relation, but any [[surjection]]

of sets. Of course this identifies $Y = X/\sim$ with $(x_1 \sim x_2) \Leftrightarrow (\pi(x_1) = \pi(x_2)) $.
Hence the _quotient topology_ on the codomain set of a function out of any topological space has as open subsets
those whose pre-images are open.

To see that this indeed does define a topology on $X/\sim$ it is sufficient to observe that taking pre-images
commutes with taking unions and with taking intersections.

Beware that for non-[[finite set|finite]] products, the descriptions of the product topology is not as simple.

Consider the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm})
and hence as a [[topological space]] via the corresponding [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).
Moreover, consider the [[closed interval]] $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ from example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals},
regarded as a [[subspace]] (def. \ref{SubspaceTopology}) of $\mathbb{R}$.

The [[product space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) of this interval with itself

$$
  [0,1] \times [0,1]
$$


is a topological space modelling the closed square. The [[quotient space]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) of that

### Closed subsets
 {#ClosedSubsets}

The [[complements]] of [[open subsets]] in a [[topological space]] are called _[[closed subsets]]_
(def. \ref{ClosedSubset} below).
This simple definition indeed captures the concept of closure in the [[analysis|analytic]]
sense of [[convergence]] of [[sequences]] (prop. \ref{ConvergenceInClosedSubspace} below). Of particular interest for the theory of topological spaces in the discussion of [[separation axioms]] [below](#SeparationAxioms) are those closed subsets which are
"[[irreducible closed subset|irreducible]]" (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible} below). These happen to be equivalently the
"[[frame]] homomorphisms" (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}) to the [[frame of opens]] of the point
(prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} below).

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}). Then
a [[subset]] $S$ of $X$ is called a _[[closed subset]]_ if its [[complement]] $X \backslash S$ is an  _[[open subset]]_:

If a [[singleton]] subset $\{x\} \subset X$ is closed, one says that $x$ is a _closed point_ of $X$.

Given any subset $S \subset X$, then its _[[topological closure]]_ $Cl(X)$ is the smallest closed subset containing $S$:

###### Remark
**([[de Morgan's law]])**

In reasoning about [[closed subsets]] in [[topology]] we are concerned with [[complements]] of [[unions]] and
[[intersections]] as well as with [[unions]]/[[intersections]] of [[complements]]. Recall therefore
that taking [[complements]] of [[subsets]] exchanges [[unions]] with [[intersections]]
([[de Morgan's law]]):

Given a [[set]] $X$ and a set of subsets

$$
  \{S_i \subset S\}_{i \in I}
$$

then

$$
  X \backslash
  \left(
     \underset{i \in I}{\cup}  S_i
  \right)
  \;\;=\;\;
   \underset{i \in I}{\cap}
   \left(
      X \backslash S_i
   \right)
$$

and

$$
  X \backslash
  \left(
     \underset{i \in I}{\cap}  S_i
  \right)
  \;\;=\;\;
   \underset{i \in I}{\cup}
   \left(
      X \backslash S_i
   \right)
  \,.
$$

Also notice that taking complements reverses inclusion relations:

$$
  \left(
    S_1 \subset S_2
  \right)
  \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\,
  \left(
    X\backslash S_2 \subset X \backslash S_1

###### Lemma

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and let $S \subset X$ be a [[subset]] of its underlying

precisely if every [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ of $x$ [[intersection|intersects]] $S$:

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) and let $S \subset X$ be a [[subset]].
Then the _[[topological interior]]_ of $S$ is the largest [[open subset]] $Int(S) \in \tau$ still contained in $S$,

The _[[boundary]]_ $\partial S$ of $S$ is the [[complement]] of its interior inside its [[topological closure]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}):

**(duality between closure and interior)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and let $S \subset X$ be a [[subset]].

###### Example
**([[topological closure]] and [[interior]] of [[closed interval|closed]] and [[open intervals]])**

Regard the [[real numbers]] as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) and equipped with the
corresponding [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}) . Let $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$. Then the [[topological interior]]
(def. \ref{IntSubset}) of the [[closed interval]] $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$
(example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) is the [[open interval]] $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$,
moreover the closed interval is its own [[topological closure]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset})
and the converse holds (by lemma \ref{RelationClAndInt}):

$$
  \array{
    Cl\left( \,(a,b)\, \right)
     \,=\,
    [a,b]
    &&
    Int\left( \, (a,b) \,  \right)

    Int\left(\,[a,b]\,\right)

Hence the  [[boundary]] of the closed interval is its endpoints, while the boundary of the open interval is
empty

The terminology "closed" subspace for complements of opens is justified by the following statement,
which is a further example of how the combinatorial concept of open subsets captures key phenomena in [[analysis]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #ConvergenceInClosedSubspace}
###### Proposition
**([[convergence]] in [[closed subspaces]])**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), regarded as a [[topological space]] via example \ref{MetricTopology},
and let $V \subset X$ be a [[subset]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $V \subset X$ is a [[closed subspace]] according to def. \ref{ClosedSubset}.

1. For every [[sequence]] $x_i \in V \subset X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}) with elements in $V$, which [[convergence|converges]]
   as a sequence in $X$ (def. \ref{Convergence}) to some $x_\infty \in X$, then $x_\infty \in V \subset X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First assume that $V \subset X$ is closed and that $x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_{\infty}$ for some
$x_\infty \in X$. We need to show that then $x_\infty \in V$. Suppose it were not, hence that
$x_\infty \in X\backslash V$. Since, by assumption on $V$, this [[complement]] $X \backslash V \subset X$ is an [[open subset]],
it would follow that there exists a [[real number]] $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that the [[open ball]]
around $x$ of radius $\epsilon$ were still contained in the complement: $B^\circ_x(\epsilon) \subset X \backslash V$.
But since the sequence is assumed to converge in $X$, this would mean that there exists $N_\epsilon$ such that all
$x_{i \gt N_{\epsilon}}$ are in $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$, hence in $X\backslash V$. This contradicts the assumption that
all $x_i$ are in $V$, and hence we have [[proof by contradiction|proved by contradiction]] that $x_\infty \in V$.

Conversely, assume that for all sequences in $V$ that converge to some $x_\infty \in X$ then $x_\infty \in V \subset X$.
We need to show that then $V$ is closed, hence that $X \backslash V \subset X$ is an open subset, hence that for every
$x \in X \backslash V$ we may find a real number $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that the [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ around $x$
of radius $\epsilon$ is still contained in
$X \backslash V$. Suppose on the contrary that such $\epsilon$ did not exist. This would mean that for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$
with $k \geq 1$ then the [[intersection]] $B^\circ_x(1/k) \cap V$ were [[inhabited|non-empty]]. Hence then we could choose
points $x_k \in B^\circ_x(1/k) \cap V$ in these intersections. These would form a sequence which clearly converges to
the original $x$, and so by assumption we would conclude that $x \in V$, which violates the assumption that $x \in X \backslash V$.
Hence we [[proof by contradiction|proved by contradiction]] $X \backslash V$ is in fact open.

A special role in the theory is played by the "irreducible" closed subspaces:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClosedIrreducible}
###### Definition
**([[irreducible closed subspace]])**

A [[closed subset]] $S \subset X$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of a [[topological space]] $X$ is called _[[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]]_ if it is
[[inhabited|non-empty]] and not the [[union]] of two closed proper (i.e. smaller) subsets. In other words,
a [[inhabited|non-empty]] closed subset $S \subset X$ is irreducible if whenever
$S_1, S_2 \subset X$ are two [[closed subspace]] such that

$$
  S = S_1 \cup S_2
$$

then $S_1 = S$ or $S_2 = S$.

###### Example
**(closures of points are irreducible)**

For $x \in X$ a [[point]] inside a [[topological space]], then
the [[topological closure|closure]] $Cl(\{x\})$ of the [[singleton]] [[subset]] $\{x\} \subset X$
is [[irreducible closed subset|irreducible]] (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible}).

###### Example
**(no nontrivial closed irreducibles in metric spaces)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]], regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).
Then every point $x \in X$ is closed (def \ref{ClosedSubset}),
hence every singleton subset $\{x\} \subset X$ is irreducible according to def. \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}.

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm})
with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}). Then for $a \lt c \subset \mathbb{R}$
the closed interval $[a,c] \subset \mathbb{R}$ (example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals} ) is _not_
irreducible, since for any $b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \lt b \lt c$ it is the union of two smaller closed subintervals:

$$
  [a,c] \,=\, [a, b] \cup [b, c]
  \,.
$$

In fact we will see below (prop. \ref{SoberFromHausdorff}) that in a metric space the singleton subsets are precisely the only
irreducible closed subsets.

Often it is useful to re-express the condition of irreducibility of closed subspaces
in terms of complementary open subsets:

+-- {: .num_prop #OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}
###### Proposition
**(irreducible closed subsets in terms of prime open subsets)**

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $P \in \tau $ be a proper [[open subset]] of $X$,
hence so that the [[complement]] $F \coloneqq X\backslash P$ is a [[inhabited|non-empty]] [[closed subspace]]. Then $F$
is [[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]] in the sense of def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible} precisely if whenever $U_1,U_2 \in \tau$ are open subsets
with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ then $U_1 \subset P$ or $U_2 \subset P$:

$$
  \left(
    X \backslash P \,\,\text{irreducible}

      \left(U_1 \subset P \;\text{or}\; U_2 \subset P\right)

  \right)
  \,.
$$

THe open subset $P \subset X$ with this property are also called the _prime open subsets_ in $\tau_X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that every [[closed subset]] $F_i \subset F$ may be exhibited as the [[complement]]

$$
  F_i = F \backslash U_i
$$

of some open subset $U_i \in \tau$ with respect to $F$. Observe that under this identification the condition
that $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_1 \cup F_2 = F$,
because it is equivalent to the equation labeled $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  F_1 \cup F_2
  & =
  (F \backslash U_1) \cup (F \backslash U_2)
  \\
  &
  = \left( X \backslash (P \cup U_1) \right) \cup \left( X \backslash P \cup U_2 \right)
  \\
  & = X \backslash
  \left(
    \left(
      P \cup U_1
    \right)
    \cap
    \left(
      P \cup U_2
    \right)
  \right)
  \\
  & = X \backslash ( P \cup (U_1 \cap U_2)  )
  \\
  & \stackrel{(\star)}{=}   X \backslash P
  \\
  & = F
  \,.
\end{aligned}
\,.
$$

Similarly, the condition that $U_i \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_i = F$,
because it is equivalent to the equality $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equalities:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F_i &= F \backslash U_i
    \\
    & = X \backslash ( P \cup U_i )
    \\
    & \stackrel{(\star)}{=} X \backslash P
    \\
    & =
    F

$$

Under these identifications, the two conditions are manifestly the same.

We consider yet another equivalent characterization of irreducible closed subsets,
prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} below, which will be needed in the
discussion of the [[sepration axioms]] further [below](#SeparationAxioms).
Stating this requires the following concept of "[[frame]]" [[homomorphism]],

underlying set of points of a topological space, and only remember the set $\tau_X$ with its

  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where the first equality holds because $\phi$ preserves finite intersections by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}, the inclusion holds because $\phi$ respects
inclusions by remark \ref{PreservationOfInclusionsByFrameHomomorphism}, and the second equality holds because $\phi$ preserves arbitrary unions
by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}.
But in $\tau_\ast = \{\emptyset, \{1\}\}$ the intersection of two open subsets is empty precisely if at least one of them is empty,
hence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$ or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$. But this means that $U_1 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ or $U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$, as claimed.

Now according to prop. \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}
the condition $(\ast)$ identifies the [[complement]]
$X \backslash U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ as an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(X,\tau)$.

Conversely, given an irreducible closed subset $X \backslash U_0$, define $\phi$ by

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  U
    \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{if} \, U \subset U_0
      \\
      \{1\} & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This does preserve

1. arbitrary unions

   because $\phi(\underset{i}{\cup} U_i) = \{\emptyset\}$ precisely if $\underset{i}{\cup}U_i \subset U_0$ which is the
   case precisely if all $U_i \subset U_0$, which means that all $\phi(U_i) = \emptyset$ and because $\underset{i}{\cup}\emptyset = \emptyset$;

   while $\phi(\underset{i}{\cup}U_1) = \{1\}$ as soon as one of the $U_i$ is not contained in $U_0$, which means that
   one of the $\phi(U_i) = \{1\}$ which means that $\underset{i}{\cup} \phi(U_i) = \{1\}$;

1. finite intersections

   because if $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U_0$, then by $(\ast)$ $U_1 \in U_0$ or $U_2 \in U_0$, whence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$
   or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$, whence with $\phi(U_1 \cap U_2) = \emptyset$ also $\phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2) = \emptyset$;

   while if $U_1 \cap U_2$ is not contained in $U_0$ then neither $U_1$ nor $U_2$ is contained in $U_0$ and hence with
   $\phi(U_1 \cap U_2) = \{1\}$ also $\phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2) = \{1\} \cap \{1\} = \{1\}$.

Hence this is indeed a frame homomorphism $\tau_X \to \tau_\ast$.

Finally, it is clear that these two operations are inverse to each other.

## Continuous functions
 {#ContinuousFunctions}

With the concept of [[topological spaces]] in hand (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace})
it is now immediate to formally implement in abstract generality the
statement of prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets}:

**principle of continuity**

$\,$ $\,$ _Continuous pre-Images of open subsets are open._

+-- {: .num_defn #ContinuousMaps}
###### Definition
**(continuous function)**

A _[[continuous function]]_ between [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace})

$$
  f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

is a [[function]] between the underlying sets,

$$
  f \colon X \longrightarrow Y
$$

such that [[pre-images]] under $f$ of open subsets of $Y$ are open subsets of $X$.

=--



We may equivalently state this in terms of [[closed subsets]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #ClosedSubsetContinuity}
###### Proposition

Let $(X_1, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be two [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}).
Then a [[function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

between the underlying [[sets]] is [[continuous function|continuous]] in the sense of def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}
precisely if [[pre-images]] under $f$ of [[closed subsets]] of $Y$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) are
closed subsets of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows since taking [[pre-images]] commutes with taking [[complements]].

=--

$\,$

Before looking at first examples of continuous functions [below](#ContinuousFunctionsExamples)
we consider now an informal remark
on the resulting global structure, the "[[category of topological spaces]]", remark \ref{TopCategory} below.
This is a language that serves to make transparent key phenomena in [[topology]]
which we encounter further below, such as the [Tn-reflection](#HausdorffReflections) (remark \ref{ReflectiveSubcategory} below),
and the [universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions).

+-- {: .num_remark #TopCategory}
###### Remark
**([[concrete category|concrete]] [[category of topological spaces]])**

For $X_1, X_2, X_3$ three [[topological spaces]] and for

$$
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_2 \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} X_3
$$

two [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) then their [[composition]]

$$
  f_2 \circ f_1
  \;\colon\;
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2 \overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow} X_3
$$

is clearly itself again a continuous function from $X_1$ to $X_3$.
Moreover, this composition operation is clearly _[[associativity|associative]]_, in that for

$$
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_2 \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} X_3
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_3 \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} X_4
$$

three [[continuous functions]], then

$$
  f_3 \circ (f_2 \circ f_1)
   =
  (f_3 \circ f_2) \circ f_1
  \;\colon\;
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_3
  \,.
$$

Finally, the composition operation is also clearly _[[unitality|unital]]_, in that for
each topological space $X$ there exists the [[identity]] function $id_X \colon X \to X$
and for $f \colon X_1 \to X_2$ any continuous function then

$$
  id_{X_2} \circ f  \;=\; f \;=\; f \circ id_{X_1}
  \,.
$$

One summarizes this situation by saying that:

1. [[topological spaces]] constitute the _[[objects]]_,

1. [[continuous functions]] constitute the _[[morphisms]]_ ([[homomorphisms]])

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AssociativityDiagram.png" width="400">
</div>

of  a _[[category]]_, called the _[[category of topological spaces]]_ ("[[Top]]" for short).

It is useful to depict collections of [[objects]] with [[morphisms]] between them
by [[diagrams]], like this one:

$\,$

$\,$

$\,$

> graphics grabbed from [Lawvere-Schanuel 09](#category+theory#LawvereSchanuel09).

There are other categories. For instance there is the [[category of sets]] ("[[Set]]" for short) whose

1. [[objects]] are [[sets]],

1. [[morphisms]] are plain [[functions]] between these.

The two categories [[Top]] and [[Set]] are different, but related. After all,

1. an [[object]] of [[Top]] (hence a [[topological space]]) is an [[object]] of [[Set]] (hence a [[set]])
equipped with [[extra structure]] (namely with a [[topological space|topology]]);

1. a [[morphism]] in [[Top]] (hence a [[continuous function]]) is a [[morphism]] in [[Set]] (hence a plain [[function]])
   with the [[extra property]] that it preserves this extra structure.

Hence we have the _underlying set assigning function_

$$
  \array{
    Top &\overset{U}{\longrightarrow}& Set
    \\
    \\
    (X,\tau) &\overset{\phantom{AAa}}{\mapsto}& X
  }
$$

from the [[class]] of [[topological spaces]] to the [[class]] of [[sets]]. But more is true:
every [[continuous function]] between topological spaces is, by definition,
in particular a function on underlying sets:

$$
  \array{
    Top &\overset{U}{\longrightarrow}& Set
    \\
    \\
    (X,\tau_X) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\overset{}{\mapsto}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    (Y, \tau_Y) &\underset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& Y
  }
$$

and this assignment (trivially) respects the [[composition]] of morphisms and the [[identity morphisms]].

Such a [[function]] between [[classes]] of [[objects]] of [[categories]], which is extended to a
function on the [[sets]] of [[homomorphisms]] between these objects in a way that respects [[composition]]
and [[identity morphisms]] is called a _[[functor]]_.  If we write an arrow between categories

$$
  U \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Set
$$

then it is understood that we mean not just a [[function]] between their [[classes]] of [[objects]],
but a [[functor]].

The functor $U$ at hand has the special property that it does not do
much except _[[stuff, structure, property|forgetting extra structure]]_, namely the extra structure on a
set $X$ given by a choice of topology $\tau_X$. One also speaks of a _[[forgetful functor]]_.

This is intuitively clear, and we may easily formalize it: The [[functor]] $U$ has the special property
that as a [[function]] between [[sets]] of [[homomorphisms]] ("[[hom sets]]", for short) it is [[injective function|injective]].
More in detail, given topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ then the component function of $U$
from the set of [[continuous function]] between these spaces to the set of plain functions between their underlying sets

$$
  \array{
    \left\{
      (X,\tau_X)
        \underoverset{\text{function}}{\text{continuous}}{\longrightarrow}
      (Y,\tau_Y)
    \right\}
      &\;\overset{\phantom{AA}U\phantom{AA}}{\mapsto}\;&
    \left\{
      X
        \underset{\text{function}}{\longrightarrow}
      Y
    \right\}
  }
$$

is an [[injective function]], including the continuous functions among all functions of underlying sets.

A [[functor]] with this property, that its component functions
between all [[hom-sets]] are injective, is called a _[[faithful functor]]_.

A [[category]] equipped with a [[faithful functor]] to [[Set]] is called a _[[concrete category]]_.

Hence [[Top]] is canonically a [[concrete category]].



=--

+-- {: .num_example #FunctorialProductSpace}
###### Example
**([[product topological space]] construction is [[functor|functorial]])**

For $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ two [[categories]] as in remark \ref{TopCategory}
(for instance [[Top]] or [[Set]]) then we obtain a new category denoted $\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{D}$
and called their _[[product category]]_ whose

1. [[objects]] are [[pairs]] $(c,d)$ with $c$ an object of $\mathcal{C}$ and $d$ an object of $\mathcal{D}$;

* [[morphisms]] are [[pairs]] $(f,g) \colon (c,d) \to (c', d')$ with $f \colon c \to d$ a morphism of $\mathcal{C}$
and $g \colon d \to d'$ a morphisms of $\mathcal{D}$,

* [[composition]] of morphisms is defined pairwise $(f', g') \circ (f,g) \coloneqq ( f' \circ f, g' \circ g )$.

This concept secretly underlies the construction of [[product topological spaces]]:

Let $(X_1,\tau_{X_1})$, $(X_2, \tau_{X_2})$, $(Y_1, \tau_{Y_1})$ and $(Y_2, \tau_{Y_2})$ be [[topological spaces]].
Then for all [[pairs]] of [[continuous functions]]

$$
  f_1 \;\colon\; (X_1, \tau_{X_1}) \longrightarrow (Y_1, \tau_{Y_1})
$$

and

$$
  f_2 \;\colon\; (X_2, \tau_{X_2}) \longrightarrow (Y_2, \tau_{Y_2})
$$

the canonically induced function on [[Cartesian products]] of sets

$$
  \array{
    X_1 \times X_2 & \overset{  f_1 \times f_2 }{\longrightarrow} & Y_1 \times Y_2
    \\
    (x_1, x_2) &\mapsto& ( f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2) )
  }
$$

is a [[continuous function]] with respect to the [[product topological spaces|binary product space topologies]]
(def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})

$$
  f_1 \times f_2
    \;\colon\;
  (X_1 \times X_2, \tau_{X_1 \times X_2})
    \longrightarrow
  (Y_1, \times Y_2, \tau_{Y_1 \times Y_2})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, this construction respects [[identity functions]] and [[composition]] of functions
in both arguments.

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), this is summarized
by saying that the [[product topological space]] construction $(-) \times (-)$ extends to a _[[functor]]_
from the [[product category]] of the [[category]] [[Top]] with itself to itself:

$$
  (-) \times (-)
    \;\colon\;
  Top \times Top
    \longrightarrow
  Top
  \,.

### Examples
 {#ContinuousFunctionsExamples}

We discuss here some basic examples of [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) between [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) to get a feeling for the nature of the concept.
But as with topological spaces themselves, continuous functions between them
are ubiquituous in mathematics, and no list will exhaust all classes of examples. Below in the section
_[Universal constructions](#UniversalConstructions)_ we discuss a general principle that serves to
produce examples of continuous functions with prescribed "[[universal properties]]".


+-- {: .num_example #TerminalityOfThePoint}
###### Example
**(point space is [[terminal object|terminal]])**

For $(X,\tau)$ any [[topological space]], then there is a unique continuous function

$$
  X \longrightarrow \ast
$$

from $X$ to the [[point topological space]] (def. \ref{Point}).


In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), this
says that the point $\ast$ is the _[[terminal object]]_ in the [[category]] [[Top]] of topological spaces.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #PointsViaContinuousFunctions}
###### Example
**([[constant functions|constant]] [[continuous functions]])**

For $(X, \tau)$ a [[topological space]] then for $x \in X$ any element of the underlying set,
there is a unique continuous function (which we denote by the same symbol)

$$
  x \;\colon\; \ast \longrightarrow X
$$

from the [[point topological space]] (def. \ref{Point}), whose image in $X$ is that element. Hence there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  \left\{
    \ast \overset{f}{\to} X
    \,\vert\, f \,\,\text{continuous}
  \right\}
    \;\simeq\;
  X
$$

between the continuous functions from the point to any topological space, and the underlying set of that topological space.

More generally, for $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ two topological spaces, then a continuous
function $X \to Y$ between them is called a _[[constant function]]_ with value some point $y \in Y$ if it
factors through the point spaces as

$$
  const_y
    \;\colon\;
  X \overset{\exists !}{\longrightarrow} \ast \overset{y}{\longrightarrow} Y
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn #FunctionLocallyConstant}
###### Definition
**([[locally constant function]])**

For $(X.\tau_X)$, $(Y,\tau_Y)$ two [[topological spaces]], then a
a [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X,\tau_X) \to (Y,\tau_Y)$ (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) is called
_[[locally constant function|locally constant]]_ if every point $x \in X$ has a [[neighbourhood]]
on which the function is constant.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #ContinuousFunctionsIntoCoDiscreteTopologicalSpaces}
###### Example
**([[continuous functions]] into and out of [[discrete space|discrete]] and [[codiscrete spaces]])**

Let $S$ be a [[set]] and let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Recall from example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}

1. the [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$;

1. the [[co-discrete topological space]] $CoDisc(S)$

on the underlying set $S$. Then [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) into/out of these satisfy:

1. every [[function]] (of sets) $Disc(S) \longrightarrow X$ out of a discrete space is [[continuous function|continuous]];

1. every [[function]] (of sets) $X \longrightarrow CoDisc(S)$ into a codiscrete space is [[continuous function|continuous]].

Also:

* every [[continuous function]] $(X,\tau) \longrightarrow Disc(S)$ into a discrete space is [[locally constant function|locally constant]] (def. \ref{FunctionLocallyConstant}).


=--


+-- {: .num_example #Diagonal}
###### Example
**([[diagonal]])**

For $X$ a [[set]], its _[[diagonal]]_ $\Delta_X$ is the [[function]] from $X$
to the [[Cartesian product]] of $X$ with itsef, given by

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
     \\
     x &\mapsto& (x,x)
  }
$$



For $(X,\tau)$ a [[topological space]], then the diagonal is a [[continuous function]]
to the [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) of $X$ with itself.

$$
  \Delta_X \;\colon\; (X, \tau) \longrightarrow (X \times X, \tau_{X \times X})
  \,.
$$

To see this, it is sufficient to see that the [[preimages]] of [[basis for a topology|basic opens]] $U_1 \times U_2$
in $\tau_{X \times X}$ are in $\tau_X$. But these pre-images are the [[intersections]] $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset X$,
which are open by the axioms on the topology $\tau_X$.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #ImageFactorization}
###### Example
**([[image factorization]])**

Let $f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]].

Write $f(X) \subset Y$ for the [[image]] of $f$
on underlying sets, and consider the resulting factorization of $f$ through $f(X)$ on underlying sets:

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  X
    \overset{\text{surjective}}{\longrightarrow}
  f(X)
    \overset{\text{injective}}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,.
$$

There are the following two ways to topologize the [[image]] $f(X)$ such as to make this a sequence of
two continuous functions:

1. By example \ref{SubspaceTopology} $f(X)$ inherits a [[topological subspace|subspace topology]] from $(Y,\tau_Y)$
which evidently makes the inclusion $f(X) \longrightarrow Y$ a [[continuous function]].

   Observe that this also makes $X \to f(X)$ a continuous function: An open subset of $f(X)$
   in this case is of the form $U_Y \cap f(X)$ for $U_Y \in \tau_Y$, and $f^{-1}( U_Y \cap f(X) ) = f^{-1}(U_Y)$,
   which is open in $X$ since $f$ is continuous.

1. By example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace} $f(X)$ inherits a [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] from $(X,\tau_X)$
   which evidently makes the surjection $X \longrightarrow f(X)$ a [[continuous function]].

   Observe that this also makes $f(X) \longrightarrow Y$ a continuous function: The preimage under this map of an
   open subset $U_Y \in \tau_Y$ is the restriction $U_Y \cap f(X)$, and the pre-image of that under $X \to f(X)$ is
   $f^{-1}(U_Y)$, as before, which is open since $f$ is continuous, and therefore $U_Y \cap f(X)$ is open in the
   quotient topology.

Beware that in general a continuous function itself (as opposed to its [[pre-image]] function) neither
preserves [[open subsets]], nor [[closed subsets]], as the following examples show:

###### Example

Regard the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm})
equipped with the [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).
For $a \in \mathbb{R}$ the [[constant function]] (example \ref{PointsViaContinuousFunctions})

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R} &\overset{const_a}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    x &\mapsto& a
  }
$$

maps every [[open subset]] $U \subset \mathbb{R}$ to the [[singleton set]] $\{a\} \subset \mathbb{R}$, which is not open.

and $\mathbb{R}$ for the set of [[real numbers]] equipped with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]
(example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology}). Then the [[identity function]] on the underlying sets

$$
  id_{\mathbb{R}} \;\colon\; Disc(\mathbb{R}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

is a [[continuous function]] (a special case of example \ref{ContinuousFunctionsIntoCoDiscreteTopologicalSpaces}).
A [[singleton set|singleton]] [[subset]] $\{a\} \in Disc(\mathbb{R})$ is open, but regarded as a subset
$\{a\} \in \mathbb{R}$ it is not open.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

(example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology}). The [[exponential function]]

$$
  \exp(-) \;\colon\; \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

maps all of $\mathbb{R}$ (which is a closed subset, since $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \backslash \emptyset$) to
the [[open interval]] $(0,\infty) \subset \mathbb{R}$, which is not closed.

Those continuous functions that do happen to preserve
open or closed subsets get a special name:

A [[continuous function]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps})

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)
$$

whose underlying function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is [[surjective function|surjective]]
exhibits $\tau_Y$ as the corresponding [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})
precisely if $f$ sends open and $f$-[[saturated subsets]] in $X$ (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated}) to open subsets of $Y$.
By lemma \ref{ComplementOfSaturatedSubsetIsSaturated} this is the case precisely if it sends
closed and $f$-saturated subsets to closed subsets.

=--

We record the following technical lemma about saturated subspaces, which we will need below
to prove prop. \ref{QuotientProjectionsOutOfCompactHausdorffSpacesAreClosedPreciselyIfTheCodomainIsHausdorff}.

###### Lemma
**(saturated open neighbourhoods of saturated closed subsets under closed maps)**

Let

1. $f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ be a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap});

1. $C \subset X$ be a [[closed subset]] of $X$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) which is $f$-[[saturated subset|saturated]] (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated});

1. $U \supset C$ be an [[open subset]] containing $C$;

then there exists a smaller open subset $V$ still containing $C$

$$
  U \supset V \supset C
$$

and such that $V$ is still $f$-[[saturated subset|saturated]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We claim that the [[complement]] of $X$ by the $f$-saturation (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated}) of the complement of $X$ by $U$

$$
  V \coloneqq X \backslash \left(  f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \backslash U \right)  \right) \right)
$$

has the desired properties. To see this, observe first that

1. the [[complement]] $X \backslash U$ is closed, since $U$ is assumed to be open;

1. hence the image $f(X\backslash U)$ is closed, since $f$ is assumed to be a closed map;

1. hence the pre-image $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \backslash U \right)\right)$ is closed, since $f$ is continuous
   (using prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}), therefore its complement $V$ is indeed open;

1. this pre-image $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \backslash U \right) \right)$ is saturated (by example \ref{PreImagesAreSaturatedSubsets})
   and hence also its complement $V$ is saturated (by lemma \ref{ComplementOfSaturatedSubsetIsSaturated}).

Therefore it now only remains to see that $U \supset V \supset C$.

By [[de Morgan's law]] (remark \ref{deMorgan}) the inclusion $U \supset V$ is equivalent to the inclusion $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \backslash U \right)\right) \supset X \backslash U$,
which is clearly the case.

The inclusion $V \supset C$ is equivalent to
$f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \backslash U \right) \right) \,\cap \, C = \emptyset$.
Since $C$ is saturated by assumption, this is
equivalent to $f^{-1}\left( f\left(  X \backslash U \right)\right) \,\cap \, f^{-1}(f(C)) = \emptyset$.
This in turn holds precisely if $f\left(  X \backslash U \right) \,\cap \, f(C)  = \emptyset$.
Since $C$ is saturated, this holds precisely if $X \backslash U \cap C = \emptyset$, and this is true by the assumption
that $U \supset C$.

### Homeomorphisms
 {#Homeomorphisms}


With the [[objects]] ([[topological spaces]]) and the [[morphisms]] ([[continuous functions]]) of the [[category]] [[Top]] thus defined
(remark \ref{TopCategory}), we obtain the concept of "sameness" in topology. To make this precise, one says that a [[morphism]]

$$
  X \overset{f}{\to} Y
$$

in a [[category]] is an _[[isomorphism]]_ if there exists a morphism going the other way around

$$
  X \overset{g}{\longleftarrow} Y
$$

which is an [[inverse]] in the sense that both its [[compositions]] with $f$ yield an [[identity morphism]]:

$$
  f \circ g = id_Y \;\;\;\;\; and \;\;\;\;\; g \circ f = id_X
  \,.
$$

Since such $g$ is unique if it exsist, one often writes "$f^{-1}$" for this [[inverse morphism]]. However, in the context
of [[topology]] then $f^{-1}$ usually refers to the [[pre-image]] function of a given [[function]] $f$, and in these
notes we will stick to this usage and never use "$(-)^{-1}$" to denote [[inverses]].

+-- {: .num_defn #Homeomorphism}
###### Definition
**([[homeomorphisms]])**


An [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] (remark \ref{TopCategory})
of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) with [[continuous functions]] between them (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps})
is called a _[[homeomorphism]]_.

Hence a _[[homeomorphism]]_ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

between two [[topological spaces]] $(X,\tau_X)$, $(Y,\tau_Y)$
such that there exists another continuous function the other way around

$$
  (X, \tau_X) \longleftarrow (Y, \tau_Y) \;\colon\; g
$$

such that their [[composition|composites]] are the [[identity functions]] on $X$ and $Y$,
respectively:

$$
  f \circ g = id_{Y} \;\;\;and\;\;\; g \circ f = id_{X}
  \,.
$$


<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Homeomorphism.png" width="560">

> graphics grabbed from [Munkres 75](#Munkres75)

We notationally indicate that a continuous function is a homeomorphism by the symbol "$\simeq$".

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X,\tau_X) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} (Y,\tau_Y)
  \,.
$$

If there is _some_, possibly unspecified, homeomorphism between topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$,
then we also write

$$
  (X,\tau_X) \,\simeq\, (Y,\tau_Y)
$$

and say that the two topological spaces _are homeomorphic._

A [[property]]/[[predicate]] $P$ of [[topological spaces]] which is [[invariant]] under homeomorphism in that

$$
  \left(
     (X, \tau_X)
     \,
       \simeq
     \,
     (Y,\tau_Y)
  \right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
    P(X,\tau_X)
     \,\Leftrightarrow\,
    P(Y,\tau_Y)
  \right)
$$

is called a _[[topological property]]_ or _topological invariant_.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

If $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) with inverse coninuous function $g$, then


1. also $g$ is a homeomophism, with inverse continuous function $f$;

1. the underlying function of sets $f \colon X \to Y$ of a homeomorphism $f$ is necessarily a [[bijection]], with inverse bijection $g$.

=--

But beware that not every [[continuous function]] which is [[bijection|bijective]] on underlying sets
is a homeomorphism. While an [[inverse function]] $g$ will exists on the level of functions of sets, this inverse may fail
to be continuous:

+-- {: .num_example #ExponentialMapFromHalfOpenIntervalToCircle}
###### Counter Example

Consider the [[continuous function]]

$$
  \array{
    [0,2\pi) &\longrightarrow& S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2
    \\
    t &\mapsto& (cos(t), sin(t))
  }
$$

from the [[half-open interval]] (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) to the unit circle $S^1 \coloneqq S_0(1) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}), regarded as a [[topological subspace]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology})
of the [[Euclidean plane]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

The underlying function of sets of $f$ is a [[bijection]]. The [[inverse function]] of sets however fails to be continuous
at $(1,0) \in S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Hence this $f$ is _not_ a [[homeomorphism]].

Indeed, below we see that the two topological spaces $[0,2\pi)$ and $S^1$ are distinguished by
[[topological invariants]], meaning that they cannot be homeomorphic via _any_ (other) choice of homeomorphism.
For example $S^1$ is a [[compact topological space]]
(def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace})
while $[0,2\pi)$ is not, and $S^1$ has a non-trivial [[fundamental group]], while that of $[0,2\pi)$
is trivial ([this prop.](Introduction+to+Topology+--+2#FundamentalGroup)).

=--

Below in example \ref{ContinuousBijectionFromClosedIntervalToCircle} we discuss a practical criterion under which continuous bijections are homeomorphisms after all. But immediate from the definitions is the following characterization:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
**([[homeomorphisms]] are the [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[open map|open]] [[bijections]])

Let $f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]]
between [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}). Then the following are equivalence:

1. $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]];

1. $f$ is a [[bijection]] and an [[open map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap});

1. $f$ is a [[bijection]] and a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear from the definition that a homeomorphism in particular has to be a bijection.
The condition that the [[inverse function]] $Y \leftarrow X \colon g$ be continuous means
that the [[pre-image]] function of $g$ sends open subsets to open subsets. But by $g$ being the inverse to
$f$, that pre-image function is equal to $f$, regarded as a function on subsets:

$$
  g^{-1} = f \;\colon\; P(X) \to P(Y)
  \,.
$$

Hence $g^{-1}$ sends opens to opens precisely if $f$ does, which is the case precisely if $f$ is an open map,
by definition.
This shows the equivalence of the first two items. The equivalence between the first and the third follows
similarly via prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}.

=--


$\,$


Now we consider some actual **examples** of [[homeomorphisms]]:


+-- {: .num_example #ConcreteAndAbstractPoint}
###### Example
**(concrete point homeomorphic to abstract point space)**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ be a [[inhabited|non-empty]] [[topological space]], and let $x \in X$ be any point.
Regard the corresponding [[singleton]] [[subset]] $\{x\} \subset X$ as equipped with its
[[topological subspace|subspace topology]] $\tau_{\{x\}}$ (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}). Then this is
[[homomorphism|homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) to the abstract [[point space]] from example \ref{Point}:

$$
  (\{x\}, \tau_{\{x\}} ) \,\simeq\, \ast
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_example #OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn}
###### Example
**(open interval homeomorphic to the real line)**

Regard the [[real line]] as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Then the open [[interval]] $(-1,1) \subset \mathbb{R}$ (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals})
regarded with its [[subspace topology]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) is [[homeomorphic]] (def.\ref{Homeomorphism}) to all of the [[real line]]

$$
  (-1,1) \,\simeq\, \mathbb{R}^1
  \,.
$$

An [[inverse]] pair of [[continuous functions]] is for instance given (via example \ref{PolynoialsAreContinuous}) by


$$
  \array{
    f &\colon&  \mathbb{R}^1 &\longrightarrow& (-1,+1)
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+ x^2}}
  }
$$

and

$$
  \array{
    g &\colon&  (-1,+1) &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}^1
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
  }
  \,.
$$

But there are many other choices for $f$ and $g$ that yield a homeomorphism.

Similarly, for all $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$

1. the [[open intervals]] $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$
(example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) equipped with their [[topological subspace|subspace topology]]
are all homeomorphic to each other,

1. the closed intervals $[a,b]$ are all homeomorphic to each other,

1. the half-open intervals of the form $[a,b)$ are all homeomophic to each other;

1. the half-open intervals of the form $(a,b]$ are all homeomophic to each other.

Generally, every [[open ball]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) is [[homeomorphic]] to all of $\mathbb{R}^n$:

$$
  \left(
    B^\circ_0(\epsilon) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
  \right)
   \,\simeq\,
  \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

=--

While mostly the interest in a given homeomorphism is in it being
non-obvious from the definitions, many homeomorphisms that appear
in practice exhibit "obvious re-identifications" for which it is
of interest to leave them _consistently implicit_:


+-- {: .num_example #CartesianSymmetricMonoidalTop}
###### Example
**(homeomorphisms between iterated product spaces)**


Let $(X,\tau_X)$, $(Y,\tau_Y)$ and $(Z, \tau_Z)$ be [[topological spaces]].

Then:

1. There is an evident [[homeomorphism]] between the two ways of bracketing the three factors when forming their
   [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}), called the _[[associator]]_:

   $$
     \alpha_{X,Y,Z}
       \;\colon\;
     \left(
       (X, \tau_X) \times (Y, \tau_Y)
     \right)
     \times
     (Z, \tau_Z)
       \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
     (X,\tau_X)
      \times
     \left(
       (Y,\tau_Y)
        \times
       (Z, \tau_Z)
     \right)
     \,.
   $$

1. There are evident [[homeomorphism]] between $(X,\tau)$ and its [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) with the [[point space]] $\ast$ (example \ref{Point}), called the left and right _[[unitors]]_:

   $$
     \lambda_X \;\colon\; \ast \times (X, \tau_X)  \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} (X,\tau_X)
   $$

   and

   $$
     \rho_X \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \times \ast \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow} (X, \tau_X)
     \,.
   $$

1. There is an evident [[homeomorphism]] between the results of the two orders in which to form their [[product topological spaces]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}), called the _[[braiding]]_:

   $$
     \beta_{X,Y}
       \;\colon\;
     (X,\tau_X) \times (Y,\tau_Y)
       \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
     (Y,\tau_Y) \times (X, \tau_X)
     \,.
   $$

Moreover, all these homeomorphisms are compatible with each other, in that they make the
following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]] (recall remark \ref{TopCategory}):

1. (triangle identity)
   $$

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}), all this is summarized by
saying that the the [[functor|functorial]] construction $(-) \times (-)$ of [[product topological spaces]]
(example \ref{FunctorialProductSpace})
gives the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] the [[structure]] of a
_[[monoidal category]]_ which moreover is _[[symmetric monoidal category|symmetrically]] [[braided monoidal category|braided]]_.

From this, a basic result of [[category theory]], the _[[coherence theorem for monoidal categories|MacLane coherence theorem]]_, guarantees that there is
no essential ambiguity re-backeting arbitrary iterations of the binary product topological space construction,
as long as the above homeomorphsims are understood.

Accordingly, we may write

$$
  (X_1, \tau_1)
    \times
  (X_2, \tau_2)
    \times
  \cdots
    \times
  (X_n, \tau_n)
$$

for iterated [[product topological spaces]] without putting parenthesis.

There is a canonical [[bijection]] between the underlying sets.
It remains to see that this, as well and its inverse, are [[continuous functions]].
For this it is sufficient to see that under this bijection the defining [[basis of a topology|basis]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase})
for the [[product topological space|product topology]] is also a basis for the [[topological subspace|subspace topology]].
But this is immediate from lemma \ref{RecognizingTopologicalBasis}.

+-- {: .num_example #HomeomorphismBetweenTopologicalAndCombinatorialCircle}
###### Example
**(closed interval glued at endpoints homeomorphic circle)**

As topological spaces, the [[closed interval]] $[0,1]$ (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) with its two endpoints identified is [[homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) to the standard [[circle]]:

$$
  [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)} \;\; \simeq \;\; S^1
  \,.
$$

More in detail: let

$$
  S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2
$$

be the unit [[circle]] in the [[plane]]

$$
  S^1 = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2, x^2 + y^2 = 1\}
$$

equipped with the [[subspace topology]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$,
which is itself equipped with its standard [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Moreover, let

$$
  [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}
$$

be the [[quotient topological space]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) obtained from the [[interval]] $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}^1$ with its [[subspace topology]] by applying the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies the two endpoints (and nothing else).

Consider then the function

$$
  f \;\colon\; [0,1] \longrightarrow S^1
$$

given by

$$
  t \mapsto (cos(t), sin(t))
  \,.
$$

This has the property that $f(0) = f(1)$, so that it descends to the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  \array{
    [0,1] &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
    \\
    && S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

We claim that $\tilde f$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (definition \ref{Homeomorphism}).

First of all it is immediate that $\tilde f$ is a [[continuous function]]. This follows immediately from the fact that $f$ is a [[continuous function]] and by definition of the [[quotient topology]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

So we need to check that $\tilde f$ has a continuous inverse function. Clearly the restriction of $f$ itself to the open interval $(0,1)$ has a continuous inverse. It fails to have a continuous inverse on $[0,1)$ and on $(0,1]$ and fails to have an inverse at all on [0,1], due to the fact that $f(0) = f(1)$. But the relation quotiented out in $[0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}$ is exactly such as to fix this failure.

Important examples of pairs of spaces that are _not_ homeomorphic include the following:


+-- {: .num_theorem #TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension}
###### Theorem
**([[topological invariance of dimension]])**

For $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ but $n_1 \neq n_2$, then the
 [[Euclidean spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}, example \ref{MetricTopology})
 are _not_ [[homeomorphic]].

More generally, an [[open subset]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ is never homeomorphic to an open subset in $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ if $n_1 \neq n_2$.

=--

The proofs of theorem \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension} are not elementary, in contrast to how obvious the statement seems to be intuitively.
One approach is to use tools from _[[algebraic topology]]_:
One assigns [[topological invariants]] to topological spaces, notably classes in [[ordinary cohomology]]  or in [[topological K-theory]]),
quantities that are [[invariant]] under [[homeomorphism]],
and then shows that these classes coincide for $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} - \{0\}$ and for $\mathbb{R}^{n_2} - \{0\}$ precisely only
if $n_1 = n_2$.

One indication that [[topological invariance of dimension]] is not an _elementary_ consequence of the axioms of topological spaces
is that a related "intuitively obvious" statement is in fact false: One might think that there is no
_[[surjective function|surjective]]_ [[continuous function]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to  \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ if $n_1 \lt n_2$.
But there are: these are called the _[[Peano curves]]_.

## Separation axioms
 {#SeparationAxioms}

The plain definition of _[[topological space]]_ ([above](#TopologicalSpaces)) happens to admit examples where distinct points or distinct subsets of the underlying set appear as more-or-less unseparable as seen by the topology on that set.

The extreme class of examples of topological spaces in which the open subsets do not distinguish
distinct underlying points, or in fact any distinct subsets, are the [[codiscrete spaces]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}).
This does occur in practice:

+-- {: .num_example #RQuotientedByQ}
###### Example
**([[real numbers]] quotiented by [[rational numbers]])**

Consider the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded
as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology})
and consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $\mathbb{R}$ which identifies two [[real numbers]] if they
differ by a [[rational number]]:

$$
  \left(
    x \sim y
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{p/q \in \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}}{\exists}
    \left(
      x = y + p/q
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then the [[quotient topological space]] (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

$$
  \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbb{R}/\sim
$$

is a [[codiscrete topological space]] (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}),
hence its topology does not distinguish any distinct proper subsets.

=--

Here are some less extreme examples:

+-- {: .num_example #SierpinskiNonSeparated}
###### Example
**(open neighbourhoods in the Sierpinski space)**

Consider the [[Sierpinski space]] from example \ref{SierpinskiSpace}, whose underlying set consists of
two points $\{0,1\}$, and whose open subsets form the set $\tau = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\} \}$.
This means that the only (open) neighbourhood of the point $\{0\}$ is the entire space.
Incidentally, also the [[topological closure]] of $\{0\}$  (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) is the entire space.
=--

+-- {: .num_example #LineWithTwoOrigins}
###### Example
**([[line with two origins]])**

Consider the [[disjoint union space]] $\mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R}$ (example \ref{DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}) of two copies of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}), which is equivalently the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})
of $\mathbb{R}$ with the [[discrete topological space]] on the 2-element set (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}):

$$
  \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R} \;\simeq\; \mathbb{R} \times Disc(\{0,1\})
$$

Moreover, consider the [[equivalence relation]] on the underlying set which identifies every
point $x_i$ in the $i$th copy of $\mathbb{R}$ with the corresponding point in the other, the $(1-i)$th copy, except when $x = 0$:

$$
  \left(
    x_i \sim y_j
  \right)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \left(
      x = y
    \right)
    \,\text{and}\,
    \left(
      \left(
        x \neq 0
      \right)
      \,\text{or}\,
      \left(
        i = j
      \right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The [[quotient topological space]] by this equivalence relation (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

$$
  \left(
    \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R}
  \right)/\sim
$$

is called the **line with two origins**. These "two origins" are the points $0_0$ and $0_1$.

We claim that in this space _every neighbourhood of $0_0$ intersects every neighbouhood of $0_1$.

Because, by definition of the [[quotient topological space|quotient space topology]], the [[open neighbourhoods]] of $0_i \in   \left( \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R} \right)/\sim$ are precisely those that contain subsets of the form

$$
 (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_i
  \;\coloneqq\;
 (-\epsilon,0) \cup \{0_i\} \cup (0,\epsilon)
 \,.
$$

But this means that the "two origins" $0_0$ and $0_1$ may not be [separated by neighbourhoods](separation+axioms#SeparatedByNeighbourhoods), since the intersection of
$(-\epsilon, \epsilon)_0$ with $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)_i$ is always non-empty:

$$
  (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_0
   \cap
  (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_1
  \;=\;
  (-\epsilon, 0) \cup (0, \epsilon)
  \,.
$$

=--


In many applications one wants to exclude at least some such exotic examples
of topologial spaces from the discussion and instead concentrate on those examples for which
the topology recognizes the separation of distinct points, or of more general
disjoint subsets.
The relevant conditions to be imposed on top of the plain [[axioms]] of a [[topological space]] are hence known as _[[separation axioms]]_
which we discuss in the following.

These axioms are all of the form of saying that two subsets (of certain kinds) in the topological space are 'separated' from each other in one sense if they are 'separated' in a (generally) weaker sense. For example the weakest axiom (called $T_0$) demands that if two points are distinct as elements of the underlying set of points, then there exists at least one [[open subset]] that contains one but not the other.

In this fashion one may impose a hierarchy of stronger axioms. For example demanding that given two distinct points, then each of them is contained in some open subset not containing the other ($T_1$) or that such a pair of open subsets around two distinct points may in addition be chosen to be disjoint ($T_2$). This last condition, $T_2$, also called the _[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff condition]]_ is the most common among all separation axioms. Historically this axiom was originally taken as part of the definition of topological spaces,
and it is still often (but by no means always) considered by default.

However, there are respectable areas of mathematics that involve topological spaces where the Hausdorff axiom fails, but
a weaker axiom is still satisfied, called [[sober topological spaces|soberity]].
This is the case notably in [[algebraic geometry]] ([[schemes are sober]]) and in [[computer science]] ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)).
These _[[sober topological spaces]]_ are singled out by the fact that they are entirely characterized by their
[[frame of opens|sets of open subsets]] with their union and intersection structure (as in def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens})
and may hence be understood independently from their underlying sets of points.

| [[separation axioms]]                 |
|---------------------------------------|
| $\array{\\ &&& T_2 = \text{Hausdorff}  \\ && \swArrow && \seArrow \\ \, & T_1 && && \text{sober} & \, \\ && \seArrow && \swArrow \\ &&& T_0 = \text{Kolmogorov} \\ }  $ |

All separation axioms are satisfied by [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), from whom the concept of topological space was originally abstracted [above](#TopologicalSpaces). Hence imposing some of them may also be understood as gauging just how far one allows topological spaces to generalize away from metric spaces





### $T_n$ spaces
 {#TnTopologicalSpaces}

There are many variants of separation axims. The classical ones are labeled $T_n$
(for German "Trennungsaxiom"). These we now introduce in def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace} and def. \ref{NormalSpace}:

+-- {: .num_defn #HausdorffTopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**(the first three [[separation axioms]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}).

For $x \neq y \in X$ any two points in the underlying set of $X$ which are not [[equality|equal]] as elements of this set,
consider the following [[propositions]]:

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/HausdorffProperty.png" width="190">
</div>


* **(T0)** _There exists a [[neighbourhood]] of one of the two points which does not contain the other point._

* **(T1)** _There exist [[neighbourhoods]] of both points which do not contain the other point._

* **(T2)** _There exists [[neighbourhoods]]_ of both points which do not intersect each other._

> graphics grabbed from [Vickers 89](#Vickers89)

The topological space $X$ is called a _$T_n$-topological space_ or just _$T_n$-space_, for short,
if it satisfies condition $T_n$ above for all pairs of distinct points.

A $T_0$-topological space is also called a _[[Kolmogorov space]]_.

A $T_2$-topological space is also called a _[[Hausdorff topological space]]_.

For definiteness, we re-state these conditions formally. Write $x,y \in X$ for points in $X$, write $U_x, U_y \in \tau$ for open [[neighbourhoods]] of these points. Then:

* **(T0**) $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left(
    \left( \underset{U_y}{\exists} \left( \{x\} \cap U_y = \emptyset \right) \right)
      \,\text{or}\,
    \left( \underset{U_x}{\exists} \left( U_x \cap \{y\} = \emptyset  \right) \right) \right)$

* **((T1)** $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left(\underset{U_x,U_y}{\exists} \left(\left( \{x\} \cap U_y = \emptyset\right)
  \, \text{and} \, \left( U_x \cap \{y\}  = \emptyset \right)\right) \right)$

* **(T2)** $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left( \underset{U_x, U_y}{\exists} \left( U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset\right) \right)$

+-- {: .num_prop #T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints}
###### Proposition
**($T_0$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is $T_0$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace})
precisely if the function $Cl(\{-\})$ that forms [[topological closures]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of [[singleton]] [[subsets]]
from the underlying set of $X$ to the set of [[irreducible closed subsets]] of $X$ (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible},
which is well defined according to example \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}), is [[injective function|injective]]:

$$
  Cl(\{-\}) \;\colon\; X \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow} IrrClSub(X)
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume first that $X$ is $T_0$. Then we need to show that if $x,y \in X$ are such that
$Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$ then $x = y$. Hence assume that $Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$.
Since the closure of a point is the [[complement]] of the union of the open subsets not containing the point
(lemma \ref{UnionOfOpensGivesClosure}),
this means that the union of open subsets that do not contain $x$
is the same as the union of open subsets that do not contain $y$.

$$
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{x\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
  \;=\;
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{y\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
$$

But if the two points were distinct, $x \neq y$, then by $T_0$ one of the above unions would contain $x$ or $y$, while the other would not, in contradiction to the above equality. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]].

Conversely, assume that if $x,y \in X$ are such that $Cl\{x\} = Cl\{y\}$ then $x = y$.
We need to show that if $x \neq y$ then there exists an open neighbourhood around one of the
two points not containing the other.

Hence assume that $x \neq y$.
By assumption it follows that $Cl(\{x\} \neq Cl(\{y\})$, hence that now

$$
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{x\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
  \;\neq\;
  \underset{ {U \subset X \, \text{open}} \atop { U \subset X\backslash \{y\} } }{\cup} \left( U \right)
 \,.
$$

This means that there must be at least one open subset which contains $x$ but not $y$, or vice versa.

###### Proposition
**($T_1$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) precisely if
all its points are [[closed points]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume first that $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$. We need to show that for every point $x \in X$ we have
$Cl(\{x\}) = \{x\}$. Since the closure of a point is the [[complement]] of the union of all open subsets not containing this point,
this is the case precisely if the union of all open subsets not containing $x$ is $X \backslash \{x\}$, hence
if every point $y \neq x$ is member of at least one open subset not containing $x$. This is true by $T_1$.

Conversely, assume that for all $x \in X$ then $Cl(\{x\}) = \{x\}$. Then for $x \neq y \in X$ two
distinct points we need to produce an open subset of $y$ that does not contain $x$. But as before,
since $Cl(\{x\})$ is the complement of the union of all open subsets that do not contain $x$,
the assumption $Cl\{x\} = \{x\}$ means that $y$ is member of one of these open subsets that do not
contain $x$.

###### Proposition
**($T_2$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau_X)$ is $T_2$=[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace})
precisely if the [[diagonal]] function $\Delta_X \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (X \times X, \tau_{X \times X})$
(example \ref{Diagonal}) is a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $(X,\tau_X)$ is Hausdorff, then by definition for every pair of distinct points $x \neq y \in X$ there exists open neighbourhoods
$U_x, U_y \in \tau_X$ such that $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$. In terms of the [[product topology]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})
this means that every point $(x,y) \in X \times X$ which is not on the diagonal has an open neighbourhood $U_x \times U_y$ which
still does not contain the diagonal. By definition this means that in fact every [[subset]] of the diagonal is a
[[closed subset]] of $X \times X$, hence in particular those that are in the image under $\Delta_X$ of closed subsets of $X$.
Hence $\Delta_X$ is a closed map.

Conversely, if $\Delta_X$ is a closed map, then the full diagonal (i.e. the image of $X$ under $\Delta_X$) is closed in $X \times X$,
and hence this means that every points $(x,y) \in X \times X$ not on the diagonal has an open neighbourhood $U_x \times U_y$
not containing the diagonal, i.e. such that $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$. Hence $X$ is Hausdorff.

**Further separation axioms**

separation axioms $T_0$, $T_1$ and $T_2$ from def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}.


+-- {: .num_defn #NormalSpace}
###### Definition

Let $(X,\tau)$ be [[topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}).

Consider the following conditions

* **(T3)** The space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) and for $x \in X$ a point and $C \subset X$ a [[closed subset]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) not containing $x$,
  then there exist disjoint [[open neighbourhoods]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_C \supset C$.

* **(T4)** The space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) and for $C_1, C_2 \subset X$ disjoint [[closed subsets]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset})
  then there exist disjoint [[open neighbourhoods]] $U_{C_i} \supset C_i$.

If $(X,\tau)$ satisfies $T_3$ it is said to be a _$T_3$-space_ also called a _[[regular Hausdorff topological space]]_.

If $(X,\tau)$ satisfies $T_4$ it is to be a _$T_4$-space_ also called a _[[normal Hausdorff topological space]]_.

The implications

$$

are immediate from the definitions. The remaining implication $T_3 \Rightarrow T_2$
follows with prop. \ref{AllPointsClosedEquivalentToT1}.

Hence instead of saying "$X$ is $T_1$ and ..." one could just as well phrase
the conditions $T_3$ and $T_4$ as "$X$ is $T_2$ and ...", which would render
the proof of prop. \ref{ImplicationsAmongTheSeparationAxioms} even more trivial.

Notice that there is a whole zoo of further variants of [[separation axioms]] that are considered in the literature.

### $T_n$ reflection
 {#HausdorffReflections}

Not every [[universal construction]] of [[topological spaces]] applied to $T_n$-spaces
results again in a $T_n$ topological space, notably [[quotient space]] constructions need not
(as in example \ref{LineWithTwoOrigins}).

But at least for $T_0$, $T_1$ and $T_2$  there is a  universal way, called _[[reflective subcategory|reflection]]_ (prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection} below),
to approximate any topological space "from the left" by a $T_n$ topological spaces.

Hence if one wishes to work within the [[full subcategory]] of the $T_n$
among all [[topological space]], then the correct way to construct quotients and other _[[colimits]]_
(see [below](#UniversalConstructions)) is to first construct them as usual [[quotient topological spaces]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}),
and then apply the $T_n$-reflection to the result.



+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflection}
###### Proposition
**($T_n$-reflection)**

Let $n \in \{0,1,2\}$. Then for every [[topological space]] $X$ there exists
a $T_n$-topological space $T_n X$ and a [[continuous function]]

$$
  t_n(X)
    \;\colon\;
  X \longrightarrow T_n X
$$

which is the  "closest approximation from the left" to $X$ by a $T_n$-topological space, in that
for $Y$ any $T_n$-space, then [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

are in [[bijection]] with [[continuous function]] of the form

$$
  \tilde f \;\colon\; T_n X \longrightarrow Y
$$

and such that the bijection is constituted by

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ t_n(X)

    X
      \overset{ t_n(X)}{\longrightarrow}
    T_n X
      \overset{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow}

**([[reflective subcategories]])**

In the language of [[category theory]] (remark \ref{TopCategory}) the $T_n$-reflection of prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}
says that

1. $T_n(-)$ is a _[[functor]]_ $T_n \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Top_{T_n}$ from the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] to the [[full subcategory]] $Top_{T_n} \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} Top$ of Hausdorff topological spaces;

1. $t_n(X) \colon X \to T_n X$ is a _[[natural transformation]]_ from the [[identity functor]] on [[Top]] to the functor $\iota \circ T_n$

1. $T_n$-topological spaces form a [[reflective subcategory]] of all [[topological spaces]] in that $T_n$ is [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion functor $\iota$; this situation is denoted as follows:

Generally, an _[[adjoint functor|adjunction]]_ between two [[functors]]

$$

and such that these bijections are "[[natural bijection|natural]]" in that they for all pairs of morphisms $f \colon c' \to c$ and $g \colon d \to d'$ then the folowing [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]:

There are various ways to see the existence and to construct the $T_n$-reflections. The following is the quickest way to see the existence, even though it leaves the actual construction rather implicit.


+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}
###### Proposition

Let $n \in \{0,1,2\}$. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on the underlying set $X$
for which $x \sim y$ precisely if for every [[surjective function|surjective]] [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ into any
$T_n$-topological space $Y$ we have $f(x) = f(y)$.

Then the set of [[equivalence classes]]

$$
  T_n X \coloneqq X /{\sim}
$$

equipped with the [[quotient topology]] is a $T_n$-topological space, and the quotient map $t_n(X) \;\colon\; X \to X/{\sim}$ exhibits the $T_n$-reflection of $X$, according to prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First we observe that every continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ into a $T_n$-topological space $Y$
factors uniquely via $t_n(X)$ through a continuous function $\tilde f$

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ h_X
$$

where

$$
  \tilde f \colon [x] \mapsto f(x)
  \,.
$$

To see this, first factor $f$ through its [[image]] $f(X)$

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow f(X) \hookrightarrow Y
$$

equipped with its [[topological subspace|subspace topology]] as a subspace of $Y$ (example \ref{ImageFactorization}). By
prop. \ref{TiSubspaces} also $f(X)$ is a $T_n$-topological space if $Y$ is.

It follows by definition of $t_n(X)$ that the factorization exists at the level of sets as stated,
since if $x_1, x_2 \in X$ have the same [[equivalence class]] $[x_1] = [x_2]$ in $T_n X$, then
by definition they have the same image under all continuous surjective functions to a $T_n$-space, hence in particular
under $X \to f(X)$. This means that $\tilde f$ as above is well defined.
Moreover, it is clear that this is the unique factorization.

To see that $\tilde f$ is continuous, consider $U \in Y$ an open subset. We need to show that $\tilde f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X/\sim$. But by definition of the [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]], this is open precisely if its pre-image under the quotient projection $t_n(X)$ is open, hence precisely if

$$
  (t_n(X))^{-1} \left( \tilde f^{-1}\left(U\right)  \right)
  =
  \left( \tilde f \circ t_n(X) \right)^{-1}(U)
  =
  f(U)
$$

is open in $X$. But this is the case by the assumption that $f$ is continuous.

What remains to be seen is that $T_n X$ as constructed is indeed a $T_n$-topological space.
Hence assume that $[x] \neq [y] \in T_n X$ are two distinct points. We need to produce open neighbourhoods
around one or both of these point not containing the other point and possibly disjoint to each other.

Now by definition of $T_n X$ the assumption $[x] \neq [y]$ means that there exists a $T_n$-topological space $Y$ and a surjective continuous function
$f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y) \in Y$. Accordingly, since $Y$ is $T_n$,
there exist the respective kinds of neighbourhoods around these image points in $Y$. Moreover, by the previous statement there
exists the continuous function $\tilde f \colon T_n X \to Y$ with $\tilde f([x]) = f(x)$ and $\tilde f([y]) = f(y)$.
By the nature of continuous functions,
the pre-images of these open neighbourhoods in $Y$ are still open in $X$ and still
satisfy the required disjunction properties. Therefore $T_n X$ is a $T_n$-space.

precisely if every [[irreducible closed subspace]] (def. \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint})
is the [[topological closure]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of a unique point, hence precisely if the function

**([[Hausdorff spaces are sober]])**

Every [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) is
a [[sober topological space]] (def. \ref{Sober}).

More specifically, in a Hausdorff topological space
the [[irreducible closed subspaces]] (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible})
are precisely the [[singleton]] [[subspaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSubspace}).

Hence, by example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}, in particular
every [[metric space]] with its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}) is sober.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The second statement clearly implies the first. To see the second
statement, suppose that $F$ is an irreducible closed subspace which
contained two distinct points $x \neq y$. Then by the Hausdorff property
there are disjoint neighbourhoods $U_x, U_y$, and hence it would follow that
the rlative [[complements]] $F \backslash U_x$ and $F \backslash U_y$ were distinct proper closed subsets of
$F$ with

$$
  F = (F \backslash U_x) \cup (F \backslash U_y)
$$

in contradiction to the assumption that $F$ is irreducible.

This [[proof by contradiction|proves by contradiction]] that every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.
Conversely, generally the [[topological closure]] of every singleton is irreducible closed, by example \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}.

### Frames of opens


What makes the concept of [[sober topological spaces]] special is that
for them the concept of [[continuous functions]] may be expressed entirely in terms
of the relations between their [[open subsets]], disregarding the underlying
set of points of which these open are in fact subsets.

Recall from example \ref{ContinuousFunctionGivesFrameHomomorphism}
that for every [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$
the [[pre-image]] function $f^{-1} \colon \tau_Y \to \tau_X$ is a [[frame]] [[homomorphism]]
(def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}).

For sober topological spaces the converse holds:

+-- {: .num_prop #FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
###### Proposition

If $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ are [[sober topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Sober}), then
for every [[frame]] [[homomorphism]] (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens})

$$
  \tau_X \longleftarrow \tau_Y \;\colon\; \phi
$$

there is a unique [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ such that $\phi$ is the function
of forming [[pre-images]] under $f$:

$$
  \phi = f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof #ProofOfFrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
###### Proof

We first consider the special case of frame homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X \;\colon\; \phi
$$

and show that these are in bijection to the underlying set $X$, identified with the continuous functions
$\ast \to (X,\tau)$ via example \ref{PointsViaContinuousFunctions}.

By prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub}, the frame homomorphisms $\phi \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$
are identified with the irreducible closed subspaces $X \backslash U_\emptyset(\phi)$ of $(X,\tau_X)$.
Therefore by assumption of [[sober topological space|sobriety]] of $(X,\tau)$ there is a unique point
$x \in X$ with $X \backslash U_{\emptyset} = Cl(\{x\})$. In particular this means that for $U_x$ an open
neighbourhood of $x$, then $U_x$ is not a subset of $U_\emptyset(\phi)$, and so it follows that $\phi(U_x) = \{1\}$.
In conclusion we have found a unique $x \in X$ such that

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  U \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      \{1\} & \vert \,\text{if}\, x \in U
      \\
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the [[inverse image]] function of the continuous function $\ast \to X$ which sends $1 \mapsto x$.

Hence this establishes the bijection between frame homomorphisms of the form $\tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X$
and continuous functions of the form $\ast \to (X,\tau)$.

With this it follows that a general frame homomorphism of the form $\tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y$
defines a function of sets $X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ by [[composition]]:

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X)
    &\mapsto&
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous analysis, an element $U_Y \in \tau_Y$ is sent to $\{1\}$ under this composite precisely if
the corresponding point $\ast \to X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is in $U_Y$, and similarly for
an element $U_X \in \tau_X$. It follows that $\phi(U_Y) \in \tau_X$ is precisely that subset of
points in $X$ which are sent by $f$ to elements of $U_Y$, hence that $\phi = f^{-1}$ is the [[pre-image]]
function of $f$. Since $\phi$ by definition sends open subsets of $Y$ to open subsets of $X$, it follows
that $f$ is indeed a continuous function. This proves the claim in generality.

###### Remark
**([[locales]])**

Proposition \ref{FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
is often stated as saying that sober topological spaces are [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the
"[[locales with enough points]]" ([Johnstone 82, II 1.](#Johnstone82)). Here "[[locale]]" refers to a concept akin to topological spaces where one considers
_just_ a "[[frame of open subsets]]" $\tau_X$, without requiring that its elements be actual [[subsets]] of some ambient set.
The natural notion of [[homomorphism]] between such generalized topological spaces are clearly the [[frame]] homomorphisms
$\tau_X \leftarrow \tau_Y$ as above. From this persepctive, prop. \ref{FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces} says that
sober topological spaces $(X, \tau_X)$ are entirely characterized by their [[frames of opens]] $\tau_X$ and just so happen to
"have enough points" such that these are actual open subsets of some ambient set, namely of $X$.

of [[frame]] [[homomorphisms]] from the [[frame of opens]] of $X$ to that of the point. Define a [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_{S X} \subset P(S X)$ on this set by declaring it to have one element $\tilde U$ for each element $U \in \tau_X$ and given by

$$

    \\
    U &\mapsto& \tilde U

in fact preserves arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Whith this the statement follows by the fact that $\tau_X$ is closed under these operations.

To see that $\widetilde{(-)}$ indeed preserves unions, observe that (e.g. [Johnstone 82, II 1.3 Lemma](#Johnstone82))

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p \in \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \widetilde{U_i} \;

where we used that the frame homomorphism $p \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ preserves unions. Similarly for intersections, now with $I$ a [[finite set]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}

=--

(e.g. [Johnstone 82, lemma II 1.7](#Johnstone82))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $S X \backslash \tilde U$ be an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(S X, \tau_{S X})$. We need to show that it is the [[topological closure]] of a unique element $\phi \in S X$.

Observe first that also $X \backslash U$ is irreducible.

To see this use [this prop.](irreducible+closed+subspace#OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible), saying that irreducibility of $X \backslash U$ is equivalent to $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U \Rightarrow (U_1 \subset U) or (U_2 \subset U)$. But if $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U$ then also $\tilde U_1 \cap \tilde U_2 \subset \tilde U$ (as in the [proof](#ProofOfSoberificationConstructionWellDefined) of lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined}) and hence by assumption on $\tilde U$ it follows that $\tilde U_1 \subset \tilde U$ or $\tilde U_2 \subset \tilde U$. By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} this in turn implies $U_1 \subset U$ or $U_2 \subset U$.  In conclusion, this shows that also $X \backslash U$ is irreducible .

By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} this irreducible closed subspace corresponds to a point $p \in S X$. By that same lemma, this frame homomorphism $p \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ takes the value $\emptyset$ on all those opens which are inside $U$. This means that the [[topological closure]] of this point is just $S X \backslash \tilde U$.

This shows that there exists at least one point of which $X \backslash \tilde U$ is the topological closure. It remains to see that there is no other such point.

So let $p_1 \neq p_2 \in S X$ be two distinct points. This means that there exists $U \in \tau_X$ with $p_1(U) \neq p_2(U)$. Equivalently this says that $\tilde U$ contains one of the two points, but not the other. This means that $(S X, \tau_{S X})$ is [[separation axiom|T0]]. By [this prop.](separation+axioms#T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints) this is equivalent to there being no two points with the same topological closure.

###### Proof

By the construction in def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, we the outer part of the following square [[commuting square|commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau^{sob}_Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{s_{S X}}}
    \\
    (S X, \tau_{S X})
     &\underset{S f}{\longrightarrow}&
    (S S X, \tau_{S S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

By lemma \ref{SoberificationIsIndeedSober} and lemma \ref{UnitIntoSXDetectsT0AndSoberity}, the right vertical morphism $s_{S X}$ is an isomorphism (a [[homeomorphism]]), hence has an [[inverse morphism]]. This defines the diagonal morphism, which is the desired factorization.

To see that this factorization is unique, consider two factorizations $\tilde f, \overline{f} \colon \colon (S X, \tau_{S X}) \to (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})$ and apply the soberification construction once more to the triangles

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{ \tilde f, \overline{f}}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \phantom{AAA}
    \mapsto
  \phantom{AAA}
  \array{
    (S X, \tau_{S X}) &\overset{S f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\simeq}\downarrow & \nearrow_{ \tilde f, \overline{f}}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

Here on the right we used again lemma \ref{UnitIntoSXDetectsT0AndSoberity} to find that the vertical morphism is an isomorphism, and that $\tilde f$ and $\overline{f}$ do not change under soberification, as they already map between sober spaces. But now that the left vertical morphism is an isomorphism, the commutativity of this triangle for both $\tilde f$ and $\overline{f}$ implies that $\tilde f = \overline{f}$.

## Compact spaces
 {#CompactSpaces}


From the discussion of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[metric spaces]] in
def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact} and prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
it is now immediate how to generalize the concept to [[topological spaces]]
to obtain a notion of _[[compact topological spaces]]_ (def. \ref{SequentiallyCompactTopologicalSpace}
and def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace} below). These compact spaces play a special role in [[topology]],
much like [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] do in [[linear algebra]].


The most naive version of the definition directly generalizes the concept via converging
sequences from def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSpaceSequeneConverging}
###### Definition
**(converging sequence in a topological space)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) and let
$(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[sequence]] of points $(x_n)$ in $X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}).
We say that this sequence _[[convergence|converges]]_ in $(X,\tau)$ to a point $x_\infty \in X$,
denoted

$$
  x_n \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
$$

if for each open [[neighbourhood]] $U_{x_\infty}$ of $x_\infty$ there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
for all $n \geq k$ then $x_n \in U_{x_\infty}$:

$$
  \left(
    x_n \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
  \right)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \underset{{U_{x_\infty} \in \tau_X} \atop {x_\infty \in U_{X_\infty}}}{\forall}
  \left(

**([[compact topological space|compactness]] in terms of closed subsets)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $(X,\tau)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] in the sense of def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}.

1. Let $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[closed subsets]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) such that their [[intersection]]
   is [[empty set|empty]] $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i = \emptyset$, then there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]

1. Let $\{C_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of [[closed subsets]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) such that it enjoys the
   _[[finite intersection property]]_, meaning that for every [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ then
   the corresponding finite intersection is [[inhabited set|non-empty]] $\underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$.
   Then also the total intersection is [[inhabited set|non-empty]], $\underset{i \in I}{\cap} C_i \neq \emptyset$.

**(closed intervals are compact)**

For any $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$ the [[closed interval]] (example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals})

$$
  [a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}
$$

regarded with its [[topological subspace|subspace topology]] is a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all the closed intervals are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (by example \ref{OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn})
it is sufficient to show the statement for $[0,1]$. Hence let $\{U_i \subset [0,1]\}_{i \in I}$ be an
open cover. We need to show that it has an open subcover.

Say that an element $x \in [0,1]$ is _admissible_ if the closed sub-interval $[0,x]$ is covered by
finitely many of the $U_i$. In this terminlogy, what we need to show is that $1$ is admissible.

Observe from the definition that

1. 0 is admissible,

1. if $y \lt x \in [0,1]$ and $x$ is admissible, then also $y$ is admissible.

This means that the set of admissible $x$ forms either an [[open interval]] $[0,g)$ or a [[closed interval]]
$[0,g]$, for some $g \in [0,1]$. We need to show that the latter is true, and for $g = 1$.
We do so by observing that the alternatives lead to contradictions:

1. Assume that the set of admissible values were an open interval $[0,g)$. By assumption there would be
   a finite subset $J \subset I$ such that $\{U_i \subset [0,1] \}_{i \in J \subset I}$ were a finite
   open cover of $[0,g)$. Accordingly, since there is some $i_g \in I$ such that $g \in U_{i_g}$, the union
   $\{U_i\}_{i \in J } \sqcup \{U_{i_g}\}$ were a finite cover of the closed interval $[0,g]$,
   contradicting the assumption that $g$ itself is not admissible (since it is not contained in $[0,g)$).

1. Assume that the set of admissible values were a closed interval $[0,g]$ for $g \lt 1$.
   By assumption there would then be a finite set $J \subset I$ such that $\{U_i \subset [0,1]\}_{i \in J \subset I}$
   were a finite cover of $[0,g]$. Hence there would be an index $i_g \in J$ such that $g \in U_{i_g}$.
   But then by the nature of open subsets in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}$, this $U_{i_g}$ would also
   contain an open ball $B^\circ_g(\epsilon) = (g-\epsilon, g + \epsilon)$. This would mean that
   the set of admissible values includes the open interval $[0,g+ \epsilon)$, contradicting the assumption.

This gives a [[proof by contradiction]].

###### Proposition
**(binary [[Tychonoff theorem]])**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be two [[compact topological spaces]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}).
Then also their [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) $(X \times Y, \tau_{X \times Y})$ is compact.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{ U_i \subset X \times Y \}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of the product space. We need to show that
this has a finite subcover.

By definition of the product space topology, each $U_i$ is the union, indexed by some set $K_i$, of [[Cartesian products]]
of open subsets of $X$ and $Y$:

$$
  U_i
    \;=\;
  \underset{k_i \in K_i}{\cup} \left(
     V_{k_i} \times W_{k_i}
  \right)
  \phantom{AAAA}
  V_{k_i} \in \tau_{X} \,\phantom{A}\text{and} \phantom{A}\, W_{k_i} \in \tau_{Y}
  \,.
$$

Consider then the [[disjoint union]] of all these index sets

$$
   K
    \,\coloneqq\,
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup}
  K_i
  \,.
$$

This is such that

$$
  (\star)
  \phantom{AA}
  \left\{
    V_{k_i} \times W_{k_i}
      \subset
    X \times Y
  \right\}_{k_i \in K}
$$

is again an open cover of $X \times Y$.

But by construction, each element $V_{k_i} \times W_{k_i}$ of this new cover is contained in at least one
$U_{j(k_i)}$ of the original cover.
Therefore it is now sufficient to show that there is
a finite subcover of $(\star)$, consisting of elements indexed by $k_i \in K_{fin} \subset K$ for some
[[finite set]] $K_{fin}$. Because then the corresponding $U_{j(k_i)}$ for $k_i \in K_{fin}$ form a finite subcover
of the original cover.

In order to see that $(\star)$ has a finite subcover, first fix a point $x \in X$ and
write $\{x\} \subset X$ for the corresponding [[singleton]] [[topological subspace]].
By example \ref{ConcreteAndAbstractPoint} this is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the abstract
[[point space]] $\ast$.
By example \ref{CartesianSymmetricMonoidalTop} there is thus a [[homeomorphism]] of the form

$$
  \{x\} \times Y \simeq Y
  \,.
$$

Therefore, since $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is assumed to be [[compact topological space|compact]], the open cover

$$
  \left\{
    \left(
      (V_{k_1} \times W_{k_1}) \cap (\{x\} \times Y)
    \right)
      \;\subset\;
    \{x\}\times Y
  \right\}_{k_i \in K}
$$

has a finite subcover, indexed by a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J_x \subset K$.

Here we may assume without restriction of generality that $x \in V_{k_i}$ for all $k_i \in J_x \subset K$,
because if not then we may simply remove that index and still have a (finite) subcover.

By finiteness of $J_x$ it now follows that the intersection

$$
  V_x
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{k_i \in J_x}{\cap} V_{k_i}
$$

is still an open subset, and by the previous remark we may assume without restriction that

$$
  x \in V_x
  \,.
$$

Now observe that by the nature of the above cover of $\{x\} \times Y$ we have

$$
  \{x\} \times Y
    \subset
  \underset{k_i \in J_x \subset K}{\cup}  V_{k_i} \times W_{k_i}
$$

and hence

$$
  \{x\} \times Y \subset \{x\} \times \underset{k_i \in J_x \subset K}{\cup} W_{k_i}
  \,.
$$

Since by construction $V_x \subset V_{k_i}$ for all $k_i \in J_x \subset K$, it follows
that we have found a finite cover not just of $\{x\} \times Y$ but of $V_x \times Y$

$$
  V_x \times Y
    \subset
  \underset{k_i \in J_x \subset K}{\cup} \left( V_{k_i} \times W_{k_i} \right)
  \,.
$$

To conclude, observe  that $\{V_x \subset X\}_{x \in X}$ is clearly an open cover of $X$,
so that by the assumption that also $X$ is compact there is a finite set of points $S \subset X$
so that $\{V_x \subset X\}_{x \in S \subset X}$ is still a cover.
In summary then

$$
  \left\{
    V_{k_i} \times W_{k_i}
    \subset X \times Y
  \right\}_{{x \in S \subset X} \atop { k_i \in J_x \subset K }}
$$

is a finite subcover as required.

In terms of the topological incarnation of the definitions of compactness, the familiar statement about metric spaces from prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace} now equivalently says the following:

###### Proposition
**([[sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]])**

If $(X,d)$ is a [[metric space]], regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}), then the following are equivalent:

1. $(X,d)$ is a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}).

1. $(X,d)$ is a [[sequentially compact topological space]] (def. \ref{SequentiallyCompactTopologicalSpace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof #ProofOfSequentiallyCompactMetricSpacesAreEquivCompact}
###### Proof
of prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace} and  prop. \ref{SequentiallyCompactMetricSpacesAreEquivCompact}

Assume first that $(X,d)$ is a [[compact topological space]]. Let $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[sequence]] in $X$. We need to show that it has a sub-sequence which [[convergence|converges]].

Consider the [[topological closures]] of the sub-sequences that omit the first $n$ elements of the sequence

$$
  F_n
   \;\coloneqq\;
  Cl(\left\{
    x_k \,\vert\, k \geq n
  \right\})
$$

and write

$$
  U_n \coloneqq X \backslash F_n
$$

for their [[open subset|open]] [[complements]].

Assume now that the [[intersection]] of all the $F_n$ were [[empty set|empty]]

$$
  (\star)
  \phantom{AA}
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cap} F_n \;= \; \emptyset
$$

or equivalently that the [[union]] of all the $U_n$ were all of $X$

$$
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} U_n
  \;=\;
  X
  \,,
$$

hence that $\{U_n \to X\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ were an [[open cover]]. By the assumption that $X$ is compact, this would imply that there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $\{i_1 \lt i_2 \lt  \cdots \lt i_k\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ with

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    X & = U_{i_1} \cup U_{i_2} \cup \cdots \cup U_{i_k}
    \\
    & = U_{i_k}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This in turn would mean that $F_{i_k} = \empty$, which contradicts the construction of $F_{i_k}$. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]] that assumption $(\ast)$ is wrong, and hence that there must exist an element

$$
  x \in \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cap} F_n
  \,.
$$

By definition of [[topological closure]] this means that for all $n$ the [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(1/(n+1))$ around $x$ of [[radius]] $1/(n+1)$ must intersect the $n$th of the above subsequence:

$$
  B^\circ_x(1/(n+1))
  \,\cap\,
  \{x_k \,\vert\, k \geq n \}
  \;\neq\;
  \emptyset
  \,.
$$

Picking one point $(x'_n)$ in the $n$th such intersection for all $n$ hence defines a sub-sequence, which converges to $x$.

This proves that compact implies sequentially compact for metric spaces.

For the converse, assume now that $(X,d)$ is sequentially compact. Let $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $X$. We need to show that there exists a finite sub-cover.

Now by the [[Lebesgue number lemma]], there exists a positive real number $\delta \gt 0$ such that for each $x \in X$ there is $i_x \in I$ such that $B^\circ_x(\delta) \subset U_{i_x}$.
Moreover, since [[sequentially compact metric spaces are totally bounded]], there exists then  a [[finite set]] $S \subset X$ such that

$$
   X
     \;=\;
   \underset{s \in S}{\cup}
   B^\circ_s(\delta)
   \,.
$$

Therefore $\{U_{i_s} \to X\}_{s \in S}$ is a finite sub-cover as required.

1. $f \colon X \to Y$ is a [[surjective function]].

Then also $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $Y$. We need show that this has a finite sub-cover.

By the continuity of $f$ the [[pre-images]] $f^{-1}(U_i)$ are [[open subsets]] of $X$, and by the surjectivity of $f$ they form an [[open cover]] $\{f^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$. Hence by compactness of $X$, there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that
$\{f^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $X$. Finall, using again that $f$ is assumed to be surjective, it follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Y
      & = f(X)
    \\
      & = f\left( \underset{i \in J}{\cup} f^{-1}(U_i) \right)
    \\
      & = \underset{i \in J}{\cup} U_i
  \end{aligned}
$$

which means that also $\{U_i \subset Y\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $Y$, and in particular a finite subcover of the original cover.

###### Corollary
**([[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]])**

If $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[continuous function]] out of a [[compact topological space]] $X$ which is not necessarily [[surjective function|surjective]], then we may consider its [[image factorization]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow f(X) \hookrightarrow Y
$$

as in example \ref{ImageFactorization}. Now by construction $X \to f(X)$ is surjective, and so lemma \ref{ContinuousSurjectionOutOfCompactSpaceHasCompactCodomain} implies that $f(X)$ is compact.

The converse to cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact} does not hold in general: the

**([[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}), and let $Y \subset X$ be a
[[closed subspace|closed]] [[topological subspace]]. Then also $Y$ is [[compact topological space|compact]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{V_i \subset Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $Y$. We need to show that this has a finite sub-cover.

By definition of the [[topological subspace|subspace topology]], there exist open subsets $U_i$ of $X$ with

$$
  V_i = U_i \cap Y
  \,.
$$

By the assumption that $Y$ is closed, the [[complement]] $X \backsalsh Y$ is an open subset of $X$, and therefore

$$
  \{ X \backslash Y \subset X\} \cup \{ U_i \subset X \}_{i \in I}
$$

is an [[open cover]] of $X$. Now by the assumption that $X$ is compact, this latter cover has a finite subcover,
hence there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that

$$
  \{ X \backslash Y \subset X\} \cup \{ U_i \subset X \}_{i \in J \subset I}
$$

is still an oopen cover of $X$, hence in particular intersects to a finite open cover of $Y$.
But since $Y \cap ( X \backsalsh Y ) = \empty$, it follows that indeed

$$
  \{V_i \subset Y\}_{i \in J \subset I}
$$

is a cover of $Y$, and in indeed a finite subcover of the original one.

Let

1. $Y \subset X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspace]].


Then for every $x \in X \backslash Y$ there exists

1. an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$;

1. an open neighbourhood $U_Y \supset Y$

such that

* they are still disjoint: $U_x \cap U_Y = \emptyset$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the assumption that $(X,\tau)$ is Hausdorff, we find for every point $y \in Y$ disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_{x,y} \supset \{x\}$ and $U_y \supset \{y\}$. By the nature of the [[subspace topology]] of $Y$, the restriction of all the $U_y$ to $Y$ is an [[open cover]] of $Y$:

$$
  \left\{
    (U_y \cap Y) \subset Y
  \right\}_{y \in Y}
  \,.
$$

Now by the assumption that $Y$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover, hence a [[finite set]] $S \subset Y$ such that

$$
  \left\{
    (U_y \cap Y) \subset Y
  \right\}_{y \in S \subset Y}
$$

is still a cover.

But the finite intersection

$$
  U_x \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y}{\cap} U_{x,s}
$$

of the corresponding open neighbourhoods of $x$ is still open, and by construction it is disjoint from all the $U_{s}$, hence in particular from their union

$$
  U_Y \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y}{\cup}  U_s
  \,.
$$


Therefore $U_x$ and $U_Y$ are two open subsets as required.

**([[Heine-Borel theorem]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, regard $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the $n$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] via example \ref{EuclideanNorm},
regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Then for a [[topological subspace]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the following are equivalent:

1. $S$ is  [[compact topological space|compact]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace});

1. $S$ is [[closed subset|closed]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) and [[bounded subset|bounded]] (def. \ref{MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}).

=--

+-- {: .proof #BorelHeineProof}
###### Proof

First consider a [[subset]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ which is closed and bounded. We need to show that
regarded as a [[topological subspace]] it is [[compact topological space|compact]].

The assumption that $S$ is bounded by (hence contained in) some [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$
implies that it is contained in $\{ (x_i)_{i = 1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^n \,\vert\, -\epsilon \leq x_i \leq \epsilon \}$.
By example \ref{ClosedIntervalsProduct}, this  topological subspace is homeomorphic to the $n$-cube
$[-\epsilon, \epsilon]^n$. Since the closed interval $[-\epsilon, \epsilon]$
is compact by example \ref{CompactClosedInterval}, the binary [[Tychonoff theorem]] (prop. \ref{BinaryTychonoffTheorem})
implies that this $n$-cube is compact. Since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]]
(lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}) this implies that $S$ is compact.

Conversely, assume that $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact subspace. We need to show that it is closed and bounded.

The first statement follows since
the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] (example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace})
and since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (prop. \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}).

Hence what remains is to show that $S$ is bounded.

To that end, choose any [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}$
and consider the [[open cover]] of all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the open [[n-cubes]]

$$
  (k_1-\epsilon, k_1+1+\epsilon)
    \times
  (k_2-\epsilon, k_2+1+\epsilon)
    \times
      \cdots
    \times
  (k_n-\epsilon, k_n+1+\epsilon)
$$

for [[n-tuples]] of [[integers]] $(k_1, k_2 , \cdots, k_n ) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$.
The restrictions of these to $S$ hence form an open cover of the subspace $S$. By the assumption that
$S$ is compact, there is then a finite subset of $n$-tuples of integers such that the
corresponding $n$-cubes still cover $S$. But the union of any finite number of bounded closed $n$-cubes
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is clearly a bounded subset, and hence so is $S$.

###### Proof

For the first statement, we need to show that if $C \subset X$ is a [[closed subset]] of $X$, then also $f(C) \subset Y$ is a closed subset of $Y$.

Now

1. since [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}) it follows that $C \subset X$ is also compact;

1. since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}) it then follows that $f(C) \subset Y$ is compact;

1. since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (prop. \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}) it finally follow that $f(C)$ is also closed in $Y$.

For the second statement we need to show that if $C \subset Y$ is a [[compact topological space|compact subset]], then also its [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(C)$ is compact.

Now

1. since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] (prop. \ref{CompactSubspacesOfHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}) it follows that $C \subse Y$ is closed;

1. since [[pre-images]] under continuous of closed subsets are closed (prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}), also $f^{-1}(C) \subset X$ is closed;

1. since [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}), it follows that $f^{-1}(C)$ is compact.

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]].

1. $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[bijection]] of [[sets]].

Then $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]], i. e. its [[inverse function]] $Y \to X$ is also a [[continuous function]].

In particular then both $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ are [[compact Hausdorff spaces]].

Write $g \colon Y \to X$ for the [[inverse function]] of $f$.

We need to show that $g$ is continuous, hence that for $U \subset X$ an [[open subset]], then also its [[pre-image]] $g^{-1}(U) \subset Y$ is open in $Y$.
By prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity} this is equivalent to the statement that for $ \subset X$ a [[closed subset]] then the [[pre-image]] $g^{-1}(C) \subset Y$ is also closed in $Y$.

But since $g$ is the [[inverse function]] to $f$, its [[pre-images]] are the [[images]] of $f$. Hence the last statement above equivalently says that $f$ sends closed subsets to closed subsets. This is true by prop. \ref{MapsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}.

###### Proof

First we claim that $(X,\tau)$ is [[regular topological space|regular]]. To show this, we need to find for each point $x \in X$ and each disjoint closed subset $Y \in X$ dijoint open neighbourhoods $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_Y \supset Y$. But since [[closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact]] (lemma \ref{ClosedSubsetsOfCompactSpacesAreCompact}), the subset $Y$ is in fact compact, and hence this is in fact the statement of lemma \ref{SeparationByNeighbourhoodsOfPointsFromCompactSubsetsInHausdorffSpaces}.

Next to show that $(X,\tau)$ is indeed normal, we apply the idea of the proof of lemma \ref{SeparationByNeighbourhoodsOfPointsFromCompactSubsetsInHausdorffSpaces} once more:

Let $Y_1, Y_2 \subset X$ be two disjoint closed subspaces. By the previous statement then for every point $y_1 \in Y$ we find disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_{y_1} \supset \{y_1\}$ and $U_{Y_2,y_1} \supset Y_2$. The union of the $U_{y_1}$ is a cover of $Y_1$, and by compactness of $Y_1$ there is a finite subset $S \subset Y$ such that

$$
  U_{Y_1} \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y_1}{\cup} U_{y_1}
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $Y_1$ and

$$
  U_{Y_2} \coloneqq \underset{s \in S \subset Y}{\cap} U_{Y_2,s}

is an open neighbourhood of $Y_2$, and both are disjoint.

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace});

1. $(Y, \tau_Y)$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $\pi \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[surjective function]].

Then $\tau_X$ is the [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] inherited from $\tau_X$ via the surjection $f$
(def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that an subset $U \subset Y$ is an [[open subset]] $(Y , \tau_Y)$ precisely if its [[pre-image]] $\pi^{-1}(U) \subset X$
is an open subset in $(X,\tau_X)$. Equivalenty, as in prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}, we need to show that $U$ is a [[closed subset]]
precisely if $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is a closed subset. The implication

$$
  \left( U \, \text{closed}\right) \,\Rightarrow\, \left( f^{-1}(U) \,\text{closed}\right)
$$

follows via prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity} from the continuity of $\pi$. The implication

$$
  \left( f^{-1}(U) \,\text{closed}\right)
   \,\Rightarrow\,
  \left( U \, \text{closed}\right)
$$

follows since $\pi$ is a [[closed map]] by prop. \ref{MapsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}.

itself still Hausdorff.

**(quotient projections out of compact Hausdorff spaces are closed precisely if the codomain is Hausdorff)**

Let

$$
  \pi \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that

1. $(X, \tau)$ is a [[compact Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}, def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $\pi$ is a [[surjection]] and $\tau_Y$ is the corresponding [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]] (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

Then the following are equivalent

1. $(Y, \tau_Y)$ is itself a [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace});

1. $\pi$ is a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The implicaton $\left( (Y, \tau_Y)\, \text{Hausdorff} \right) \Rightarrow \left( \pi \, \text{closed}  \right)$
is given by prop. \ref{MapsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}. We need to show the converse.

Hence assume that $\pi$ is a closed map. We need to show that for every pair of
distinct point $y_1 \neq y_2 \in Y)$ there exist [[open neighbourhoods]] $U_{y_1}, U_{y_2} \in \tau_Y$
which are disjoint, $U_{y_1} \cap U_{y_2} = \emptyset$.

Therefore consider the [[pre-images]]

$$
  C_1 \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{y_1\})
  \phantom{AA}
  C_2 \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{y_2\})
  \,.
$$

Observe that these are [[closed subsets]], because in the Hausdorff space $(Y, \tau_Y)$
(which is hence in particular $T_1$) the singleton subsets $\{y_i\}$ are closed
by prop. \ref{AllPointsClosedEquivalentToT1}, and since pre-images under continuous functions preserves closed subsets by
prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity}.

Now since [[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]]  it follows (by def. \ref{NormalSpace}) that we may find disjoint open subset $U_1, U_2 \in \tau_X$
such that

$$
  C_1 \subset U_1 \phantom{AAA} C_2 \subset U_2
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by lemma \ref{SaturatedOpenNeighbourhoodsOfSaturatedClosedSubsets} we may find these $U_i$ such that they
are both [[saturated subsets]] (def. \ref{SubsetSaturated}). Therefore finally lemma \ref{SaturatedOpenNeighbourhoodsOfSaturatedClosedSubsets}
says that the images $\pi(U_i)$ are open in $(Y,\tau_Y)$. These are now clearly disjoint open neighbourhoods of $y_1$ and $y_2$.

[[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

This is clearly a [[continuous function]] and a [[bijection]] on the underlying sets.
Moreover, since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] (cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact})
and since the closed interval $[0,1]$ is compact (example \ref{CompactClosedInterval}) we also obtain another proof that
the [[circle]] is compact.

Hence by prop. \ref{ContinuousBijectionsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreHomeomorphisms}
the above map is in fact a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  [0,2\pi]/\sim \;\simeq\; S^1

is _not_ a homeomorphism, even though this, too, is a bijection on the the underlying sets.

does not apply.

## Universal constructions
 {#UniversalConstructions}


One point of the general definition of [[topological space]] [above](#TopologicalSpaces) is that it admits constructions which intuitively should exist on "continuous spaces", but which do not in general exist on  [[metric spaces]].

Examples include the construction of [[quotient topological spaces]] of metric spaces, which are not [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]
anymore (e.g. example \ref{LineWithTwoOrigins}), and hence in particular are not metric spaces anymore (by example \ref{HausdorffMetricSpace}).

Now from a more abstract point of view, a [[quotient topological space]] is a special case of a "[[colimit]]" of topological
spaces. This we explain now.

Generally, for every [[diagram]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of topological spaces (remark \ref{TopCat}),
hence for every collection of topological spaces with a system of [[continuous functions]] betwen them, then
there exists a further topological space, called the _[[colimit|colimiting]] space_ of the diagram,
which may be thought of as the result of "gluing" all the spaces in the diagram together, while using the
maps between them in order to identify those parts "along which" the spaces are to be glued.

One may formalize this intuition by saying that the colimiting space has the property that it receives compatible continuous functions
from all the spaces in the diagram, and that it is characterized by the fact that it is
_[[universal property|universal with this property]]_: every compatible system of maps to another space uniquely
factors through the colimiting one.

Therefore forming colimits of topological spaces is a convenient means to construct new spaces which have
prescribed properties for continuous functions out of them. We implicitly used a simple special case of this
phenomenon in the proof of the [[Hausdorff reflection]] in prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}, when we concluded
the existence of certain unique factorizing maps out of the Hausdorff qotient of a topological space.

[[formal dual|Dual]] to the concept of [[colimits]] of topological space is that of "[[limits]]" of
[[diagrams]] of topological spaces (not to be confused with [[limits of sequences]] _in_ a topological space).
Here one considers topological spaces with the [[universal property]] of having compatible continuous
functions into a given [[diagram]] of spaces.

Most constructions of new topological spaces that one builds from given spaces are obtained by forming limits and/or colimits
of diagrams of the original spaces.

**([[diagram]] in a [[category]])**

A [[diagram]] $X_\bullet$ in a [[category]], such as the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]]
or the category [[Set]] of [[sets]] from remark \ref{TopCategory}, is

1. a [[set]] $\{ X_i \}_{i \in I}$ of [[objects]] in the category;

1. for every [[pair]] $(i,j) \in I \times I$ of labels of objects a [[set]]
   $\{ X_i \overset{ f_\alpha }{\longrightarrow} X_j\}_{\alpha \in I_{i,j}}$ of [[morphisms]] between these objects;

1. for each [[triple]] $i,j,k \in I$ [[function]]

   $$
     comp_{i,j,k} \;\colon\; I_{i,j} \times I_{j,k} \longrightarrow I_{i,k}

such that

1. for every $i \in I$ the [[identity morphisms]] $id_{X_i} \colon X_i \to X_i$ is part of the diagram;

1. $comp$ is [[associativity|associtive]] and [[unital]] in the evident sense,

1. for every composable pair of morphisms

  $$
    X_i
      \overset{f_{\alpha} }{\longrightarrow}
    X_j
      \overset{ f_{\beta} }{\longrightarrow}
    X_k

  then the [[composition|composite]] of these two morphisms equals the morphisms of the diagram that is
  labeled by the value of $comp_{i,j,k}$ on their labels:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies} for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

any [[cone]] over the diagram, then by construction there is a unique function of underlying sets $S \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i$ making the required diagrams commute, and so all that is required is that this unique function is always [[continuous function|continuous]]. But this is precisely what the initial topology ensures.

**(single cell attachment)**

For $X$ any [[topological space]] and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then an _$n$-cell attachment_ to $X$ is the result of gluing an [[n-disk]] to $X$, along a prescribed image of its bounding [[n-sphere|(n-1)-sphere]] (def. \ref{SpheresAndDisks}):

Let

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; S^{n-1} \longrightarrow X
$$

be a [[continuous function]], then the "attaching space"

$$
  X \cup_\phi D^n \,\in Top
$$

is the topological space which is the [[pushout]] of the boundary inclusion of the $n$-sphere along $\phi$, hence the universal space that makes the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow &(po)& \downarrow

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

A single cell attachment of a 0-cell, according to example \ref{SingleCellAttachment} is the same as forming the [[disjoint union space]] $X \sqcup \ast$ with the [[point]] space $\ast$:

$$
  \array{
     (S^{-1} = \emptyset) &\overset{\exists !}{\longrightarrow}&  X
     \\
     \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
     \\
     (D^0 = \ast) &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

In particular if we start with the [[empty topological space]] $X = \emptyset$ itself, then by attaching 0-cells we obtain a [[discrete topological space]]. To this then we may attach higher dimensional cells.

###### Definition
**(attaching many cells at once)**


If we have a [[set]] of attaching maps $\{S^{n_i-1} \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} X\}_{i \in I}$ (as in def. \ref{SingleCellAttachment}), all to the same space $X$, we may think of these as one single continuous function out of the [[disjoint union space]] of their [[domain]] spheres

$$
  (\phi_i)_{i \in I}
    \;\colon\;
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup}
  S^{n_i-1}
   \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

Then the result of attaching _all_ the corresponding $n$-cells to $X$ is the pushout of the corresponding [[disjoint union]] of boundary inclusions:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} S^{n_i - 1}
      &\overset{(\phi_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}&
    X

1. $Y = \underset{k\in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} X_k$ is the [[union]] of all these cell attachments, and $f \colon X \to Y$ is the canonical inclusion; or stated more abstractly: the map $f \colon X \to Y$ is the inclusion of the first component of the diagram into its [[colimit|colimiting cocone]] $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k X_k$:

   $$
     \array{
       X = X_0 &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\longrightarrow& \cdots
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow && \cdots
       \\
       && Y = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet
     }
   $$

If here $X = \emptyset$ is the [[empty space]] then the result is a map $\emptyset \hookrightarrow Y$, which is equivalently just a space $Y$ built form "attaching cells to nothing". This is then called just a _topological [[cell complex]]_ of countable hight.

Finally, a topological (relative) cell complex of countable hight is called a **CW-complex** is the $(k+1)$-st cell attachment $X_k \to X_{k+1}$ is entirely by $(k+1)$-cells, hence exhibited specifically by a pushout of the following form:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} S^{k}
      &\overset{(\phi_i)_{i \in I}}{\longrightarrow}&
    X_k
    \\
    \downarrow
      &(po)&
    \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} D^{k+1}
      &\longrightarrow&
    X_{k+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

A _[[finite CW-complex]]_ is one which admits a presentation in which there are only finitely many attaching maps, and similarly a _countable CW-complex_ is one which admits a presentation with countably many attaching maps.

Given a CW-complex, then $X_n$ is also called its $n$-[[skeleton]].
