## Idea

Let $T$ be a [[dg-category]] and $D(T)$ its [[derived dg-category]]. Consider the [[dg-Yoneda embedding]]
  $$ h : T \hookrightarrow D(T). $$
The [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by its [[essential image]] is denoted $Tri(T) \subset D(T)$, and the [[thick subcategory|thick]] [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by its [[essential image]] is denoted $Perf(T) \subset D(T)$. It coincides with the [[full subcategory]] of [[compact objects]] of $D(A)$.
