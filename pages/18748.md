## Idea

In flat geometry the parallel vectors (with the same orientation or not) form an equivalence class. The same holds for lines and even higher dimensional oriented subspaces. The equivalence classes, usually with the orientation taken into account, is called a direction (in the case of higher dimension, $n$-direction, see also [[bivector]]).

## Definition

For $V$ a [[real vector space]], the _direction_ of a non-zero vector $v \in V$ is its [[equivalence class]] under the multiplication with [[positive number|positive]] [[real numbers]].

Recall that a nonzero vector is __parallel__ to a subspace $W$ of a vector space $V$ if it has a representative of the form $\vec{A B}$ with $A,B\in W$. Two ponzero vectors are mutually parallel if one is a nonzero multiple of another.

Direction of a _nonzero_ vector in a vector space over any field is geometrically defined as the __equivalence class of lines parallel to the vector__. Sometimes one talks oriented lines instead (In complex case one gives real orientation on complex lines by choosing a real subspace of real dimension $1$.)

If $V$ is a [[normed vector space]] or [[inner product space]]s in particular (as they have the induced [[norm]] $v\mapsto \sqrt{\langle v, v\rangle}$), the (oriented) __direction__ of a nonzero vector $v$ is represented by the unit direction vector (with the same direction in any of the above senses) and it can be expressed by the formula

$$
  v/{\vert v\vert} \;\in \; S(V)
  \,.
$$
and is an element of the [[unit sphere]] $S(V)$ of $V$. (e.g [MathWorld](#MathWorld)).


Similarly the _unoriented direction_ of a non-zero vector in any vector space is its [[equivalence class]] under multiplication with any non-zero element of the [[ground field]], hence the element it represents in the corresponding [[projective space]] $P V$.

The unit direction vector can be atached not only to a (direction of) a vector but also to a direction of lines per se (see Wikipedia, _[Direction vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_vector)_).

J. Lelong-Ferrand defines the direction of an affine subspace of an affine space as its orbit under the action of the translation group. This agrees with the parallelness in Choquet where two affine subspaces of the same dimension are parallel if their translation group of vectors (as a subgroup of the group of vectors of the entire space) is the same.
