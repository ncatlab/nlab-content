## Idea

In flat [[geometry]] the [[parallel]] [[vectors]] with the same [[orientation]] form an [[equivalence class]].  The same holds for oriented lines and even higher dimensional oriented subspaces.  The equivalence class of a vector (or other object) is called its *direction*.  (In the case of higher dimension we may say "$n$-direction"; see also [[bivector]].)  If the vector space is [[normed space|normed]], then each such equivalence class has a canonical [[unit vector]] representative, called a *direction vector*.

If we neglect the orientation we get a bigger equivalence class, called the *unoriented direction*.  Unoriented directions have a representing unit vector only up to sign.

## Definition

### Oriented direction

For $V$ a [[real vector space]], or more generally a vector space over an [[ordered field]], the _direction_ of a non-zero vector $v \in V$ is its [[equivalence class]] under the multiplication with [[positive number|positive]] scalars.  Equivalently, it may be defined as the equivalence class of oriented lines parallel to $v$ and having the same orientation.

(Recall that a nonzero vector $v$ is __parallel__ to a subspace $W$ of a vector space $V$ if $v$ has a representative of the form $\vec{A B}$ (i.e. $v = A - B$) with $A,B\in W$.  When $W$ is a line, we say that $v$ furthermore has the same orientation as $W$ if $\vec{A B}$ points in the positive direction along $W$.

If $V$ is a [[normed vector space]] (such as an [[inner product space]] with the induced [[norm]] $v\mapsto \sqrt{\langle v, v\rangle}$), the (oriented) __direction__ of a nonzero vector $v$ is canonically represented by the unit direction vector (with the same direction in any of the above senses) and it can be expressed by the formula

$$
  v/{\vert v\vert} \;\in \; S(V)
  \,.
$$
and is an element of the [[unit sphere]] $S(V)$ of $V$. (e.g [MathWorld](#MathWorld)).

### Unoriented direction

Similarly, the _unoriented direction_ of a non-zero vector in any vector space is its [[equivalence class]] under multiplication by non-zero elements of the [[ground field]], hence the element it represents in the corresponding [[projective space]] $P V$.  Unlike oriented direction, this makes sense over an arbitrary field.

The unit direction vector can be attached not only to a (direction of) a vector but also to a direction of lines per se (see Wikipedia, _[Direction vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_vector)_).

J. Lelong-Ferrand defines the direction of an affine subspace of an affine space as its orbit under the action of the translation group. This agrees with the parallelness in Choquet where two affine subspaces of the same dimension are parallel if their translation group of vectors (as a subgroup of the group of vectors of translations of the entire space) is the same.
