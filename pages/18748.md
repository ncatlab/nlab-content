## Definition

Recall that a nonzero vector is __parallel__ to a subspace $W$ of a vector space $V$ if it has a representative of the form $\vec{A B}$ with $A,B\in W$.

Direction of a _nonzero_ vector is the __equivalence class of lines parallel to the vector__. Sometimes one talks oriented lines instead.

In the setup of normed vector spaces and [[inner product space]]s in particular (as they have the [[norm]] $v\mapsto \sqrt{\langle v, v\rangle}$), the oriented direction class is represented by the unit vector with the same direction.

For $V$ an [[normed vector space]] with [[norm]] $v\mapsto {\vert v\vert}$ the _direction_ of a nonzero element $v \in V$  is represented by the unit vector

$$
  v/{\vert v\vert} \;\in \; S(V)
  \,.
$$
