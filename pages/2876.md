## Idea

A [[monad]] $\mathbf{G}=(G,\mu,\eta)$ on an [[additive category]] $A$ is **additive** if its underlying [[endofunctor]] $G:A\to A$ is an [[additive functor]]. One defines an **additive [[comonad]]** in the same vein.

Note that every additive category is [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enriched]], and an additive monad is then the same as an [[Ab]]-[[enriched monad]].
