## Idea

In theoretical [[cosmology]], the term _ekpyrotic cosmology_ ([Khoury-Ovrut-Steinhardt-Turok 01](#KhouryOvrusSteinhardtTurok01)) refers to the hypothesis that the [[observable universe]] is the locus of the collision of two [[branes]] in an ambient higher-dimensional [[spacetime]]. The scenario is vaguely motivated from the [[Randall-Sundrum model]] (which in turn was vaguely motivated from [[Horava-Witten theory]]) but with the two branes there not being static but colliding with or even passing through each other, possibly repeatedly ("cyclic cosmology" [Steinhardt-Turok 01](#SteinhardtTurok01)).

Just like the [[Randall-Sundrum model]], also the ekpyrotic model is loosely [[string theory inspired model|string theory inspired]] but initially without the ambition to check whether there really are [[string theory vacua]] with these proporties. Recent more detailed analysis points to the contrary ([Uzawa 18](#Uzawa18)).
