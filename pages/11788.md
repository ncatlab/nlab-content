## Definition

### In 1-topos theory

Let $(C, \tau)$ be a [[small site|small]] [[cartesian site|cartesian]] [[site]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
An object $X$ of $C$ is called **stable** if for all morphisms $Y \to X$ from a [[compact object]] $Y$, the [[domain]] of the [[kernel pair]] $R \rightrightarrows Y$ of $f$ is also a [[compact object]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
An object $X$ of $C$ is called **coherent** if it is [[compact object|compact]] and stable.

###### Theorem
Let $(C, \tau)$ be a [[small site|small]] [[cartesian site|cartesian]] [[site]], and suppose that $\tau$ is generated by finite [[covering families]].  For an object $X$ of $C$, let $l(X)$ denote the [[sheaf]] [[sheafification|associated]] to the [[presheaf]] [[representable functor|represented]] by $X$.  Then

* $l(X)$ is a coherent object of the [[topos]] $Sh(C, \tau)$, for all objects $X$ in $C$,
* if $(C, \tau)$ is further a [[pretopos]] with its [[coherent coverage]], then every [[coherent object]] of $Sh(C, \tau)$ is isomorphic to $l(X)$ for some $X$.

### In $(\infty,1)$-topos theory
 {#InInfinityToposTheory}

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

An [[object]] $X$ in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is an _$n$-coherent object_ if the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/X}$ is an [[n-coherent (∞,1)-topos]]

###### Remark

A coherent object which is also [[n-truncated object of an (∞,1)-category|n-truncated]] for some $n$ is called a _[[finitely constructible object]]_.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

[[∞Grpd]] is a [[coherent (∞,1)-topos]] and a [[locally coherent (∞,1)-topos]]. An [[object]] $X$, hence an [[∞-groupoid]], is an $n$-coherent object if all its [[homotopy groups]] in degree $k \leq n$ are [[finite set|finite]]. Hence the fully coherent objects here are the [[homotopy types with finite homotopy groups]].
