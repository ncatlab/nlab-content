###### Definition
An object $X$ of $C$ is called **stable** if for all morphisms $Y \to X$ from a [[compact object]] $Y$, the [[domain]] of the [[kernel pair]] $R \rightrightarrows Y$ of $f$ is also a [[compact object]].

###### Definition
An object $X$ of $C$ is called **coherent** if it is [[compact object|compact]] and stable.

###### Theorem
Let $(C, \tau)$ be a [[small site|small]] [[cartesian site|cartesian]] [[site]], and suppose that $\tau$ is generated by finite [[covering families]].  For an object $X$ of $C$, let $l(X)$ denote the [[sheaf]] [[sheafification|associated]] to the [[presheaf]] [[representable functor|represented]] by $X$.  Then

* $l(X)$ is a coherent object of the [[topos]] $Sh(C, \tau)$, for all objects $X$ in $C$,
* if $(C, \tau)$ is further a [[pretopos]] with its [[coherent coverage]], then every [[coherent object]] of $Sh(C, \tau)$ is isomorphic to $l(X)$ for some $X$.

This is ([Johnstone, Theorem D3.3.7](#JohnstoneSketches)).
