## Definition

A _positive operator_ is a [[linear operator]] $A$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $(H, \langle -,-\rangle)$ such that the [[quadratic form]]

$$
  v \mapsto \langle v, A v\rangle
$$

for $v \in H$ is positive.

###### Definition
An element $A$ of an (abstract) [[C*-algebra]] is called **positive** if it is [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] and its [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] is contained in $[0, \infinity)$.

Here, 'positive' means positive semidefinite; see at [[inner product]] for the family of variations of this notion.  (The relevant inner product here is that associated with the quadratic form above: $v, w \mapsto \langle v, A w\rangle$.)
