## Idea

A **pseudo-distributive law** is a vertical [[categorification]] of a [[distributive law]], relating two [[pseudomonads]] on a [[bicategory]].  There are various different levels of weakness that such a thing can exist at.  As with ordinary distributive laws, a pseudo-distributive law governs the lifting of one pseudomonad to the Eilenberg-Moore and Kleisli bicategories of the other.

## Definition

See any of the references, particularly [(CHP)](#CHP)

## Examples

* If $T$ is a [[pseudo-commutative 2-monad|pseudo-commutative]] [[2-monad]] on [[Cat]], then there is a pseudo-distributive law between $T$ and the 2-monad whose algebras are [[symmetric monoidal categories]]; see [(Kelly)](#Kelly).

* [[Grothendieck fibrations]] and opfibrations on a [[category]] $C$ (or more generally an object of a suitable 2-category) are the algebras for a pair of pseudomonads.  If $C$ has pullbacks, there is a pseudo-distributive law between these pseudomonads, whose joint algebras are the [[bifibrations]] satisfying the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]]; see [(von Glehn)](#vonGlehn).

* [[generalized polycategories]] are naturally defined relative to a pseudo-distributive law on a [[Prof]]-like bicategory; see [(Garner)](#Garner) for the canonical example of ordinary (symmetric) [[polycategories]].

* Pseudo-distributive laws involving [[lax-idempotent 2-monads]] have an especially nice form; see [(Marmolejo)](#MarmolejoDL) and [(Walker)](#Walker).
