## Idea

In [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]_ there is discussion of the _[[cohesion]]_ of some [[substance]]. [[William Lawvere]] argued that the "[[objective logic]]" of this discussion is to be formalized via [[categorical logic]] by the axiomatics of [[cohesive toposes]] (see there for references), i.e. by [[modal type theory]] equipped with [[shape modality]] and [[flat modality]].

But Hegel goes on to speak of cohesion being refined to _elasticity_:

> [PN§297Zusatz](Science+of+Logic#PN297Zusatz) Elasticity is the whole of cohesion.

Moreover, according to [PN§298](Science+of+Logic#PN298) this elasticity is related to the [[unity of opposites]] that consistute [[Zeno's paradox of motion]], hence to the modern concept of [[differentiation]] via a [[limit of a sequence]].  In terms of [[categorical logic]] this is precisely what is encoded in the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] and [[infinitesimal flat modality]] of "[[differential cohesion]]". 

Sticking to imagery from [[solid state physics]], this is reminiscent of concepts in [infinitesimal strain theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_strain_theory). This applies to 

> structures built from relatively stiff elastic materials 

(And so maybe it would be suggestive to rename "differential cohesion" to "elastic cohesion"?)
