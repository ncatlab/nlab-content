## Idea

The term _geometrodynamics_ has been coined, or at least promoted, by [[John Wheeler]] as a description for the dynamics of [[gravity]] according to [[general relativity]]. Since the field of [[gravity]] is entirely encoded in the [[spacetime]] [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|metric geometry]], there is some justification for thinking of the dynamics of the gravitational field as being "the dynamics of geometry" itself. Hence the term.

More specifically the term _geometrodynamics_ is associated with Wheeler's speculation that all of physics might fundamentally be described by configurations of gravity coupled to other fields, notably the field of [[electromagnetism]], but without any matter: one can see that certain [[spacetime]]s without any matter content but with certain nontrivial [[topology]] may locally effectively look as if they contained massive and possibly charged bodies. 

For instance on a spacetime that is obtained from two copies of [[Minkowski space]] connected by a thin (as measured by the metric) throat -- often called a _wormhole_ -- an electric field configuration whose field lines all converge to the throat's mouth in one of the two Minkowski sheets, pass through the throat and then emegere concentrically in the other Minkowski sheet may have no divergence anywhere, hence according to [[electromagnetism|Maxwell's equations]] have no charge sources anywhere, and still effectively look to an observer constrained to one of the two Minkowski sheets but relatively far away from the throat's mouth as if they were the field lines of a positively or negatively charged point source located where the mouth of the throat is.

These kinds of ideas Wheeler liked to describe by phrases such as _charge without charge_ and _mass without mass_ . Later these basic ideas have continued a life notably in the context of attempts to describe gravity by a [[topological quantum field theory]], for instance in approaches to describe [[gravity as a BF-theory]].
