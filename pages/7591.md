## Idea

The generalization in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of the notion of _[[group of units]]_ in ordinary category theory.

## Definition

### Unaugmented definition

+-- {: .num_defn #PlainInfinityGroupOfUnits}
###### Definition

Let $A$ be an [[A-∞ algebra|A-∞]] [[ring spectrum]]. 

For $\Omega^\infty A$ the underlying [[A-∞ space]] and $\pi_0 \Omega^\infty A$ the ordinary [[ring]] of connected components, write $(\pi_0 \Omega^\infty A)^\times$ for its [[group of units]]. 

Then the [[∞-group of units]] 

$$
  A^\times \coloneqq GL_1(A)
$$

of $A$ is the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] $GL_1(A)$ in

$$
  \array{
    GL_1(A) &\to& \Omega^\infty A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    (\pi_0 \Omega^\infty A)^\times &\to& \pi_0 \Omega^\infty A
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In terms of [[derived algebraic geometry]] one has that 

$$
  GL_1(A) \simeq \mathbb{G}_m(A) = Hom(Spec A, \mathbb{G}_m)
$$

is the [[mapping space]] from $Spec A$ into the [[multiplicative group]].
This point of view is adopted for instance in ([Lurie, p. 20](#Lurie)).

=--

### Augmented definition
 {#AugmentedDefinition}

There is slight refinement of the above definition, which essentially adds one 0-th "grading" homotopy group to $B gl_1(E)$ and thereby makes the $\infty$-group of units of [[E-∞ rings]] be canonically [[augmented ∞-group|augmented]] over the [[sphere spectrum]] ([Sagave 11](#Sagave11)).

+-- {: .num_defn #AugmentedGroupOfUnits}
###### Definition

There is a functor

$$
  gl_1^J \colon CRing_\infty \to AbGrp_\infty/\mathbb{S}
  \,,
$$

given by ...

=--

This is ([Sagave 11, def. 3.14 in view of example 3.8](#Sagave11)). See also ([Sagave 11, section 1.4](#Sagave11)) for comments on how this yields an $\infty$-version of $\mathbb{Z}$-grading on an abelian group.

+-- {: .num_prop #FiberSequenceForExtendedGl1}
###### Proposition

For $E$ an [[E-∞ ring]], there is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of [[abelian ∞-groups]]

$$
  gl_1(E) \to gl_1^J(E) \to \mathbb{S}
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have the ordinary $\infty$-group of units of def. \ref{PlainInfinityGroupOfUnits} and on the right we have the [[sphere spectrum]], regarded (being a [[connective spectrum]]) as an [[abelian ∞-group]].

=--

Here the existence of the map $gl_1(E) \to gl_1^J(E)$ is ([Sagave 11, lemma 2.12 + lemma 3.16 ](#Sagave11)). The fact that the resulting sequence is a homotopy fiber sequence is ([Sagave 11, prop. 4.1](#Sagave11)).


Using this, there is now a modified delooping of the ordinary $\infty$-group of units:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $bgl_1^\ast(E)$ for the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $gl_1^J(E) \to \mathbb{S}$ to yield

$$
  gl_1(E) \to gl_1^J(E) \to \mathbb{S} \to bgl_1^\ast(E)
  \,.
$$

=--

([Sagave 11, prop. 4.3](#Sagave11))


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

It ought to be true that the non-connective delooping $bgl_1^\ast(E)$ sits inside the full [[Picard ∞-group]] of $E Mod$. ([Sagave 11, remark 4.11](#Sagave11)). (Apparently it's the full inclusion on those degree-0 twists which are grading twists, i.e. on the elements $(-)\wedge\Sigma^n E$.)

See also at _[twisted cohomology -- by R-module bundles](twisted+cohomology#InfSections)_.

 {#Properties}

### Adjointness to $\infty$-group $\infty$-ring
 {#AdjointnessToGroupRing}

####  Unaugmented case

+-- {: .num_defn #GroupOfUnitsFunctor} 
###### Definition

Write

$$
  gl_1 \; \colon \;  CRing_\infty \to AbGrp_\infty
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-functor]] which sends a [[E-∞ ring|commutative ∞-ring]] to its [[∞-group of units]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

The [[∞-group of units]] [[(∞,1)-functor]] of def. \ref{GroupOfUnitsFunctor} is a  right-[[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  CRing_\infty 
  \stackrel{\overset{\mathbb{S}[-]}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{gl_1}{\to}}
  AbGrp_\infty
  \,.
$$

=--

This is ([ABGHR 08, theorem 2.1/3.2, remark 3.4](#ABGHR08)).

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

The [[left adjoint]]

$$
  \mathbb{S}[-] \colon AbGrp_\infty \to CRing_\infty
$$

is a higher analog of forming the [[group ring]] of an ordinary [[abelian group]] over the [[integers]] 

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[-] \colon Ab \to CRing
  \,,
$$

which is indeed [[left adjoint]] to forming the ordinary [[group of units]] of a ring.

We might call $\mathbb{S}[A]$ the **[[∞-group ∞-ring]]** of $A$ over the [[sphere spectrum]].

=--

####  Augmented case

Also the augmented $\infty$-group of units functor of def. \ref{AugmentedGroupOfUnits} is a homotopy right adjoint. ([Sagave 11, theorem 1.7](#Sagave11)).

### Homotopy groups

The [[homotopy groups]] of $GL_1(E)$ are

$$
  \pi_n(GL_1(E))
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       \pi_0(E)^\times & |\, n = 0
       \\
       \pi_n(E) & | \, n \geq 1
    }
  \right.
$$

### Cohomology and logarithm
 {#CohomologyAndLogarithm}

Given $E$ an [[E-∞ ring]], then write $gl_1(E)$ for its $\infty$-group of units regarded as a [[connective spectrum]]. For $X$ the [[homotopy type]] of a  [[topological space]], then the [[cohomology]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by $gl_1(E)$ in degree 0 is the ordinary [[group of units]] in the [[cohomology ring]] of $E$:

$$
  H^0(X, gl_1(E))  \simeq (E^0(X))^\times
  \,.

$$

In positive degree the canonical map of pointed homotopy types $GL_1(E) = \Omega^\infty gl_1(E) \to \Omega^\infty E$ is in fact an [[isomorphism]] on all [[homotopy groups]]

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \geq 1} GL_1(E) \simeq \pi_{\bullet \geq 1} \Omega^\infty E
  \,.
$$

On cohomology elements this map

$$
  \pi_q(gl_1(E)) \simeq \tilde H^0(S^q, gl_1(E)) \simeq  (1+ \tilde R^0(S^q))^\times \subset (R^0(S^q))^\times
$$


is [[logarithm]]-like, in that it sends $1 + x \mapsto x$.

But there is not a homomorphism of [[spectra]] of this form. This only exists after [[K(n)-local stable homotopy theory|K(n)-localization]], where it is called then the [[logarithmic cohomology operation]], see there for more.

([Rezk 06](#Rezk06))

### Relation to Picard $\infty$-group and Brauer $\infty$-group
 {#RelationToPicardInfinityGroups}

Given an [[E-∞ ring]] $E$, the [[looping]] of the Brauer $\infty$-group is the [[Picard ∞-group]] ([Szymik 11, theorem 5.7](#Szymik11)). 

$$
  \Omega Br(E) \simeq Pic(E).
$$

The [[looping]] of that is the ∞-group of units ([Sagave 11, theorem 1.2](#Sagave11)).

$$
  \Omega^2 Br(E) \simeq \Omega Pic(E) \simeq GL_1(E)
  \,.
$$

## Examples

### Snaith's theorem and the units of K-theory and complex cobordism
 {#SnatihTheorem}

[[Snaith's theorem]] asserts that 

1. the [[K-theory spectrum]] for [[complex K-theory]] is the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] of the [[circle 2-group]] localized away from the [[Bott element]] $\beta$:

   $$
     KU \simeq (\mathbb{S}[B U(1)])[\beta^{-1}]
     \,;
   $$

1. the [[periodic complex cobordism spectrum]] is the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] of the [[classifying space]] for stable [[complex vector bundles]] (the classifying space for [[topological K-theory]]) localized away from the [[Bott element]] $\beta$:

   $$
     MU \simeq (\mathbb{S}[B U])[\beta^{-1}]
     \,.
   $$

### Units of topological modular forms

Analysis of the $\infty$-group of units of [[tmf]] is in ([Ando-Hopkins-Rezk 10, from section 12 on](#AndoHopkinsRezk10)).

### Inclusion of circle $n$-bundles into higher chromatic cohomology

By [Snaith's theorem](#SnatihTheorem) above there is a canonical map

$$
  B U(1) \to \mathbb{S}[B U(1)] \to  KU
$$

that sends [[circle bundles]] to cocycles in [[topological K-theory]]. 

At the next level there is a canonical map

$$
  B^2 U(1) \to \mathbb{S}[B^2 U(1)] \to tmf
$$

that sends [[circle 2-bundles]] to [[tmf]]. See at _[tmf -- Inclusion of circle 2-bundles](tmf#InclusionOfCircle2Bundles)_.

Write $gl_1(K(n))$ for the [[∞-group of units]] of the (a) 
[[Morava K-theory]] spectrum.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $p = 2$ and all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]]

$$
  Maps(B^{n+1}U(1), B gl_1(K(n)))
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}/(2)
$$

between the [[mapping space]] from the [[classifying space]] for [[circle n-bundle|circle (n+1)-bundles]] to the [[delooping]] of the [[∞-group of units]] of $K(n)$.

=--

([Sati-Westerland 11, theorem 1](#SatiWesterland11))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at [[(∞,1)-vector bundle]] this means that for each such map there is a type of [[twisted cohomology|twist]] of Morava K-theory (at $p = 2$).
