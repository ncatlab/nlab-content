## Idea ##

The **$E_k$-operad** or **little $k$-cubes operad** is the [[operad]] or [[(infinity,1)-operad]] whose $n$-aray operations are parameterized by rectilinear disjoint embeddings of $n$ $k$-dimensional cubes into another $k$-dimensional cube.

When regarded as a [[topological operad]], the topology on the space of all such embedding is such that a continuous path is given by continuously moving the images of these little cubes in the big cube around.

Therefore the [[algebra over an operad|algebras over]] the $E_k$-operad are "$k$-fold monoidal" objects For instance [[k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-category|k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-categories]].

The limiting $E_\infty$-operad is the resolution of the ordinary commutative monoid operad $Comm$. Its algebras are [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy commutative monoid objects]] such as $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity ring|rings]].
