## Idea

One way to define a _connection_ on a [[vector bundle]] $E \to X$ is as a [[principal connection]] of the $GL(n)$-[[principal bundle]] that the vector bundle is an [[associated bundle]] to. Another is as a [[covariant derivative]] on the space of [[sections]] of the vector bundle.

## Examples

* [[flat vector bundle]]

* [[Bott connection]]

(...)

## References

An exposition with an eye towards applications in [[gauge theory]] is in section 16.3 of
