**Ieke Moerdijk** is a professor of mathematics at the Mathematisch Instituut of the Radboud University Nijmegen. Previously he was in Utrecht.  His main interests are in [[sheaf]] and [[topos theory]], [[descent]] and [[cohomology]], [[synthetic differential geometry]], [[operads]], [[groupoids]], [[stacks]] and [[orbifolds]], [[Lie groupoids]] and foliations, and abstract homotopy theory (Quillen [[model categories]]).
