## Idea

A _proper base change theorem_ asserts a [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] for [[base change]] in [[cohomology]] along a [[proper map]].

## In étale cohomology

Let $p \colon X \longrightarrow S$ be a [[proper morphism of schemes]]. For $f \colon T \longrightarrow S$ any other morphism into $S$, consider the [[fiber product]]

$$
  \array{
    X \times_S T &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f^\ast p}} \downarrow & & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    T &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \,.
  }
$$

The étale proper base change theorem says that in this situation and for $\mathcal{F}$ an [[abelian sheaf]] of [[torsion groups]] on $X$, the [[derived functor|derived]] pull-push along the top and left is isomorphic to the derived push-pull along the bottom right. (...)
