
## Definition

A **totally isotropic subspace** of an [[inner product space]] is a sub-[[vector space]] on which the [[bilinear form]] vanishes.

An **isotropic subspace** of a [[symplectic vector space]] is a [[vector space|vector subspace]] on which the [[symplectic form]] vanishes.

A maximal isotropic subspace is called a **[[lagrangian subspace]]**.

The space of all isotropic subspaces of a given inner product space is called its **[[isotropic Grassmannian]]**.

A [[submanifold]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] each [[tangent space]] of which is isotropic with respect to the ambient symplectic structure is an **[[isotropic submanifold]]**.
