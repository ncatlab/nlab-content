
A topotally isotropic subspace of an [[inner product space]] is a sub-[[vector space]] on which the [[bilinear form]] vanishes.

An **isotropic subspace** of a [[symplectic vector space]] is a sub-[[vector space]] on which the [[symplectic form]] vanishes.

A maximal isotropic subspace is called a [[lagrangian subspace]].

The space of all isotropic subspaces of a given inner product space is called its [[isotropic Grassmannian]].
