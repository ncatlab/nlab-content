The **formality theorem** by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] states that there is an [[L-∞-algebra]] [[quasi-isomorphism]] from the [[dg-Lie algebra]] of [[polyvector field]]s (with zero differential and [[Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket]]) to the [[dg-Lie algebra]] of the shifted [[Hochschild cohomology|Hochschild cochain complex]] (with Hochschild differential and Gerstenhaber bracket), whose first Taylor coefficient is the [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem|HKR]] quasi-isomorphism.

The formality theorem implies that every [[Poisson manifold]] has a canonical [[deformation quantization]].
