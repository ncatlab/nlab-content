The formality theorem states that there is an $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphism from the dg Lie algebra of polyvector fields (with zero differential and [[Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket]]) to the dg Lie algebra of the shifted [[Hochschild cohomology|Hochschild cochain complex]] (with Hochschild differential and Gerstenhaber bracket), whose first Taylor coefficient is the [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem|HKR]] quasi-isomorphism.
