## Idea

Often a ([[smooth function|smooth]]) [[function]] on an [[infinite-dimensional manifold]] (or on a more general [[smooth space]]) is called a _functional_, especially when [[scalar]]-valued. A central example are the _[[action functionals]]_ in [[physics]]. The [[calculus of variations]] is largely about such functionals.

To distinguish from the specifically [[linear functionals]] in [[functional analysis]], one might speak here of _nonlinear functionals_. However, in practice the context is usually understood and the adjective "nonlinear" is rarely used explicitly.  There are also nonlinear functionals in functional analysis, such as [[quadratic forms]].

The reason for the name is that (like the infinite-dimensional [[vector spaces]] of functional analysis), these infinite-dimensional manifolds were originally spaces of [[functions]] (typically between finite-dimensional manifolds), and functions of functions are the original meaning of [[functional]].
