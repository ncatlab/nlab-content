## Idea

The _splitting principle_ in [[Chern-Weil theory]]/[[nonabelian cohomology]] is a method of turning a $G$-[[principal bundle]] for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] into a [[torus]] bundle (hence _splitting_ it into [[complex line bundles]]) such that the [[universal characteristic classes]] of the original $G$-bundle may be computed in terms of the (generally simpler) classes of this torus bundle.

## Statement

Let $G$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact Lie group]] and write $U(1)^n \simeq T \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} G$ for a [[maximal torus]].

Let $X$ be a [[connected topological space]] and $P \to X$ a $G$-[[principal bundle]] over $X$ [[classifying space|classified]] by a map $g \colon X \to B G$.

Then consider the [[coset space]] $G/T$ and the $G/T$-[[fiber bundle]] $Y\to X$ [[associated bundle|associated]] to $P$, this is equivalently the [[homotopy pullback]] in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    Y &\stackrel{(g_1,\cdots, g_n)}{\longrightarrow}& B T & \simeq B U(1)^n 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{B i}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& B G
  }
  \,.
$$

This diagram shows that the pullback of the $G$-principal bundle $P \to X$ along $p$ to $Y$ is equivalently a $T$-principal bundle splitting as [[circle group]]-principal bundles classified by $(g_1, \cdots, g_n)$. 

That this is a useful splitting is the content of:

###### Theorem
**(generalized splitting principle)**

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] in which a [[prime number]] $p$ is a [[unit]] if $H_\bullet(B G,\mathbb{Z})$ has a $p$-[[torsion subgroup]].

Then

1. The $H^\bullet(B G,R)$-module $H^\bullet(B T, R)$ (via $B i^\ast$) is [[free module|free]] on the cohomology of $G/T$:

   $$
     H^\bullet(B T,R)\simeq H^\bullet(B G,R) \otimes H^\bullet(G/T, R)
     \,;
   $$

1. Analogously there is an isomorphism

   $$
     H^\bullet(Y,R) \simeq H^\bullet(X,R)\otimes H^\bullet(G/T,R)
   $$

   and hence $p^\ast$ is the canonical inclusion (and hence in particular is an [[injection]])
   
   $$
     p^\ast \;\colon\;  H^\bullet(X,R)\hookrightarrow H^\bullet(Y,R)
     \,.
   $$

In this general form this is due to ([May](#May)).

###### Remark

Since the elements 

$$
  c \in H^\bullet(B G,R)
$$ 

are the [[universal characteristic classes]] of $G$-principal bundles with [[coefficients]] in $R$ (hence by [[Chern-Weil theory]] the [[invariant polynomials]] of the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ if $R$ has [[characteristic]]-0), theorem \ref{GeneralizedSplittingPrinciple}
gives the following way to express the characteristic classes of $G$-principal bundles on $X$ by [[tuples]] 
$$
  (c_1^1, \cdots, c_1^n) \coloneqq (B i)^\ast c
$$ 

of characteristic classes -- hence [[first Chern class|first Chern classes]] -- of just circle bundles ([[line bundles]]):

$$
  p^\ast (c(P)) \simeq (g_1^\ast c_1^1, \cdots, g_n^\ast c_1^n)
  \,.
$$

(Since $p^\ast$ is injective, this is a genuine characterization of $c(P)$).

## Examples
 {#Examples}

### Complex vectors bundles and their Chern roots
 {#ComplexVectorBundleAndTheirChernRoots}

For $G = U(n)$ the [[unitary group]], the [[universal characteristic classes]] are the [[Chern classes]] $c_k \in H^\bullet(B U(n), \mathbb{Z})$. By the discussion at _[Chern class -- Properties -- Splitting principle and Chern roots](Chern+class#SplittingPrinciple).
the universal splitting principle here says that 

$$
  (B i)^\ast(\sum_k c_k) = (1 + x_1) \cdots (1+ x_n)
  \,,
$$

where the $x_i \in H^\bullet(B U(1)^n , \mathbb{Z})$ are the universal characteristic classes of the [[maximal torus]], hence are $n$ incarnations of the universal [[first Chern class]] (equivalently: the [weights](group+character#RelationToChernRootsAndSplittingPrinciple) of the [[group characters]] of $U(n)$).
It follows that every [[complex vector bundle]] $\xi$ of [[rank]] $n$ over a space $X$ when pulled back to its [[flag space]] bundle decomposes as a [[direct sum]] of [[complex line bundles]] $\zeta_i$ and has [[Chern classes]] $c_k$ expressed in terms of the [[first Chern classes]] of these line bundles as

$$
  c_k(p^\ast \xi ) = \sigma_k(c_1(\zeta_1), \cdots, c_n(\zeta_n))
  \,.
$$

This case is what is traditionally is often meant by default by the "splitting principe".

For the [[special unitary group]] the situation is the same, only that here the splitting is into a sum of line bundles used [[tensor product]] is constrained to be trivializable.

### Real vector bundles 
 {#RealVectorBundles}

Under the _[Relation between Pontryagin classes and Chern classes](Pontryagin+class#FurtherRelationToChernClasses)_ the above translates into a splitting principle also for [[real vector bundles]].

### Genera and Hirzebruch characteristic series

The basic theorem of [[Hirzebruch series]] expresses [[genera]] via the splitting principle. The Hirzebruch characteristic series $K_\phi$ is a [[series]] in a single variable $x = c_1(L)$, to be thought of as the [[first Chern class]] of the universal [[complex line bundle]] over $B U(1)$. 

The Hirzebruch formula for the value of the [[genus]] $\phi$ on an [[orientation|oriented]] [[manifold]] $X$

$$
  \phi(X) = \langle K_\phi(T X), [X]\rangle
$$

denotes the pairing of that class of the [[tangent bundle]] with the [[fundamental class]] which under the splitting principle pulls back on the [[flag space]] bundle to the class $\prod_k K_\phi(x_k)$ of the corresponding direct sum of line bundles.
