## Idea

The _splitting principle_ in [[Chern-Weil theory]]/[[nonabelian cohomology]] is a method of turning a $G$-[[principal bundle]] for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] into a [[torus]] bundle (hence _splitting_ it into [[line bundles]]) such that the [[universal characteristic classes]] of the original $G$-bundle may be computed in terms of the (generally simpler) classes of this torus bundle.

## Statement

Let $G$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact Lie group]] and write $U(1)^n \simeq T \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} G$ for its [[maximal torus]].

Let $X$ be a [[connected topological space]] and $P \to X$ a $G$-[[principal bundle]] over $X$ [[classifying space|classified]] by a map $g \colon X \to B G$.

Then consider the [[coset space]] $G/T$ and the $G/T$-[[fiber bundle]] $Y\to X$ [[associated bundle|associated]] to $P$, this is equivalently the [[homotopy pullback]] in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    Y &\stackrel{(g_1,\cdots, g_n)}{\longrightarrow}& B T & \simeq B U(1)^n 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{B i}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& B G
  }
  \,.
$$

This diagram shows that the pullback of the $G$-principal bundle $P \to X$ along $p$ to $Y$ is equivalently a $T$-principal bundle splitting as [[circle group]]-principal bundles classified by $(g_1, \cdots, g_n)$. 

That this is a useful splitting is the content of:

###### Theorem
**(generalized splitting principle)**

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] in which a [[prime number]] $p$ is a [[unit]] if $H_\bullet(B G,\mathbb{Z})$ has a $p$-[[torsion subgroup]].

Then

1. The $H^\bullet(B G,R)$-module $H^\bullet(B T, R)$ (via $B i^\ast$) is [[free module|free]] on the cohomology of $G/T$:

   $$
     H^\bullet(B T,R)\simeq H^\bullet(B G,R) \otimes H^\bullet(G/T, R)
     \,;
   $$

1. Analogously there is an isomorphism

   $$
     H^\bullet(Y,R) \simeq H^\bullet(X,R)\otimes H^\bullet(G/T,R)
   $$

   and hence $p^\ast$ is the canonical inclusion (and hence in particular is an [[injection]])
   
   $$
     p^\ast \;\colon\;  H^\bullet(X,R)\hookrightarrow H^\bullet(Y,R)
     \,.
   $$

In this general form this is due to ([May](#May)).

###### Remark

Since the elements 

$$
  c \in H^\bullet(B G,R)
$$ 

are the [[universal characteristic classes]] of $G$-principal bundles with [[coefficients]] in $R$ (hence by [[Chern-Weil theory]] the [[invariant polynomials]] of the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ if $R$ has [[characteristic]]-0), theorem \ref{GeneralizedSplittingPrinciple}
gives the following way to express the characteristic classes of $G$-principal bundles on $X$ by [[tuples]] 
$$
  (c_1^1, \cdots, c_1^n) \coloneqq (B i)^\ast c
$$ 

of characteristic classes -- hence [[first Chern class|first Chern classes]] -- of just circle bundles ([[line bundles]]):

$$
  p^\ast (c(P)) \simeq (g_1^\ast c_1^1, \cdots, g_n^\ast c_1^n)
  \,.
$$

(Since $p^\ast$ is injective, this is a genuine characterization of $c(P)$).
