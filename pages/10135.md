## Idea

Since the crucial extra [[structures]] carried by an [[orbifold]] are

1. geometric structure (e.g. [[topology|topological]], [[algebraic geometry|algebro-geometric]], [[differential geometry|differential-geometric]], [[supergeometry|super-geometric]], etc.)

1. [[singularities]]

the [[cohomology]] of orbifolds should be such as to provide [[invariants]] which are sensitive not just to the underlying plain [[homotopy type]] of an orbifold (its [[shape modality|shape]]) but also to this extra structure. This means that _orbifold cohomology_ should, respectively, unify

1. geometric cohomology (e.g. [[sheaf cohomology|sheaf]] [[hypercohomology]], [[differential cohomology]], etc.)

1. [[equivariant cohomology]] in its fine form of [[Bredon cohomology]]
 
in the sense that [[differential cohomology|geometric cohomology]] is recovered away from the orbifold [[singularities]] and [[equivariant cohomology]] is recovered right at the [[singularities]], while globally orbifold cohomology provides a unification of these two aspects.

History

According to [Abramovich 05, p. 42](#Abramovich05):

> On December 7, 1995 [[Maxim Kontsevich]] delivered a history-making lecture at Orsay, titled _String Cohomology_. This is what is now know, after [Chen-Ruan 00](#ChenRuan00), as _orbifold cohomology_, Kontsevich's lecture notes described the orbifold and  [[quantum cohomology]] of a global quotient [[orbifold]]. Twisted sectors, the age grading, and a version of orbifold stable maps for global quotients are all there.

The same lecture also introduced _[[motivic integration]]_.
