###### Proposition
**(a countable union of countable sets is countable)**

Assuming the [[axiom of countable choice]] then:

Let $I$ be a [[countable set]] and let 
$\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an $I$-[[dependent type|dependent set]] of [[countable sets]] $S_i$. Then the [[disjoint union]]

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} S_i
$$

is itself a countable set
