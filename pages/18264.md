###### Proposition
**(a countable union of countable sets is countable)**

Assuming the [[axiom of countable choice]] then:

Let $I$ be a [[countable set]] and let 
$\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an $I$-[[dependent type|dependent set]] of [[countable sets]] $S_i$. Then the [[disjoint union]]

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} S_i
$$

is itself a countable set.

###### Proof 
Classical proof: we may assume all the $S_i$ are [[nonempty set|nonempty]]. For each $i \in I$, choose a [[surjection]] $f_i: \mathbb{N} \to S_i$ (this requires the axiom of countable choice) and also a surjection $f: \mathbb{N} \to I$. Then we have a composite surjection 

$$\mathbb{N} \stackrel{pair}{\to} \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \stackrel{f \times 1}{\to} I \times \mathbb{N} \cong \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \mathbb{N} \stackrel{\underset{i \in I}{\cup} f_i}{\to} \underset{i \in I}{\cup} S_i$$ 

where for $pair: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ we may take for example the function that is inverse to $(x, y) \mapsto \binom{x+y+1}{2} + y$. 

For constructive mathematicians who accept the axiom of countable choice, the proof is only slightly more elaborate. Here we define a set to be *countable* if it is a [[quotient]] of (is enumerated by) a [[decidable subset]], i.e., [[complemented subobject]] of $\mathbb{N}$. (To be continued.)
