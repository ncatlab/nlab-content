## Idea

A [[moduli space]] of [[connections on bundles]] over some prescribed [[space]].

Often one considers [[flat connections]] only, see at _[[moduli space of flat connections]]_.

## Properties

### Compactness

If $\Sigma$ is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], then the moduli space of flat connections over $\Sigma$ is compact. 

### Over complex manifolds / complex varieties

Over a [[complex manifold]]/[[complex variety]], the [[Koszul-Malgrange theorem]] identifies holomorphic [[flat connections]] on [[complex vector bundles]] with [[holomorphic vector bundles]]. This identifies the moduli space of flat connections as a [[complex manifold]] with (a non-abelian version of) the first Griffiths [[intermediate Jacobian]]. See at _[intermediate Jacobian -- Examples -- k=0](http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/intermediate+Jacobian#ExamplePicard)_.

More specifically over a [[Riemann surface]] _[[Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem]]_ identifies the [[moduli spaces of flat connections]] with that of certain [[complex manifold|complex]] spaces of [[stable vector bundle|stable]] [[holomorphic vector bundles]].  This space appears as the [[phase space]] for [[Chern-Simons theory]] over that surface. See there for more.

More generally, the [[Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem]] similarly gives a [[Kähler structure]] on the moduli space of flat connections also over higher dimensional Kähler manifolds ([Scheinost-Schottenloher 96, corollary 1.16](#ScheinostSchottenloher96)).

## Examples

### Flat connections over a torus
  {#FlatConnectionsOverATorus}

Let $G$ be a [[compact Lie group]]. Assume either that $G$ is [[simply connected]] or is a [[torus]] (what we really need below is that any two commuting elements in $G$ sit jointly in one [[maximal torus]]). 

The moduli space of $G$ [[flat connections]] on a 2-dimensional [[torus]] $A \simeq S^1 \times S^1$ (e.g. underlying a complex [[elliptic curve]]) has the following description:

first, the [[moduli stack]] of flat connections is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [\Pi(A), \mathbf{B}G] 
    & \simeq [B [A, S^1], \mathbf{B}G]
    \\
    & \simeq Hom_{Grp}(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}, G)//_{ad} G
  \end{aligned}
$$

(see also the discussion at _[characters and fundamental groups of tori](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group+character#CharactersAndFundamentalGroupsOfTori)_).

Here a single [[flat connection]] is just a choice of pair of two commuting elements in $G$, and $G$ acts on that by [[conjugation]]. Now any two commuting elements can be taken to sit in a [[maximal torus]] $T \hookrightarrow G$, and up to [[conjugation]] we can take this to be one fixed maximal torus. This means that the moduli space is actually

$$
  \pi_0 \left(
    Hom_{Grp}([A,S^1], G)//_{ad} G
  \right)
  \simeq
  Hom_{Grp}([A, S^1], T)/W
  \,,
$$

where $W$ is the [[Weyl group]] $W = N_G(T)/T$. 

Moreover, by [[Pontryagin duality]] this may be re-expressed as

$$
  \cdots \simeq Hom_{Grp}([T,S^1], A)/W
  \,.
$$

where now $[T,S^1]$ is the [[character group]] of the [[maximal torus]].

In this form the moduli space of flat connections appears prominently for instance in the discussion of [[equivariant elliptic cohomology]].
