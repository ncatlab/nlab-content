## Definition ##

Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a [[ringed space]].  Consider the subsheaf of sets $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{O}_X$ such that for each open subset $U \subset X$, $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{S})$ consists of only the regular sections of $\mathcal{O}_X$ over $U$, i.e. those elements of $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X)$ which are not zero divisors.  Consider the [[presheaf]] of rings on $X$
  \[ U \quad\mapsto\quad \Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X)[\Gamma(U, \mathcal{S})^{-1}] \]
which assigns to $U$ the [[ring of fractions]] of $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X)$ with denominators in $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{S})$; its [[sheafification]] $\mathcal{M}_X$ is called the **sheaf of (germs of) meromorphic functions on $X$**.  The sections of $\mathcal{M}_X$ over $X$ are called the **meromorphic functions on X** and we denote this ring $M(X) = \Gamma(X, \mathcal{M}_X)$.

###### Proposition

For every open subset $U \subset X$ there is a canonical isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}_U$ and the restriction of $\mathcal{M}_X$ to $U$.

###### Proposition

For every point $x \in X$ there is a canonical isomorphism between the stalk $\mathcal{M}_{X,x}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}[\mathcal{S}_x^{-1}]$.
