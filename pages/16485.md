# Linearly compact vector spaces, modules, rings, objects

## Motivation

Linearly compact vector space were introduced in the development of the idea of duality. The (algebraic) linear dual of the discrete infinite-dimensional vector space is of larger cardinality so the original space is not isomorphic to the dual of its dual. But if a natural formal topology (which comes say from the filtration of the original space by its finite-dimensional subspaces; the formal topology on the dual is equivalent to consider the dual cofiltration) is given to the algebraic dual, then it makes sense to take the space of _continuous_ linear functional and we recover the original vector space. More precisely this amounts to an embedding of the category of (discrete) vector spaces into the category of linearly compact vector spaces, the latter category has a duality which extends the duality for finite-dimensional vector spaces. 

A standard reference for the basics is the Dieudonné's book on formal groups. 

The next definition is copied from Tom Leinster's note that's listed below. 

## Definition

A **linearly compact vector space** over a field $k$ is a topological vector space $V$ over $k$ such that:

* The topology is linear: the open affine subspaces form a basis for the topology.
* Any family of closed affine subspaces with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.
* The topology is Hausdorff.
