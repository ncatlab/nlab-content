## Idea

A slight variant $\tilde Mot_{num}(k,\mathbb{Q})$ of the [[category of pure motives|category of pure]] [[numerical motives]] $Mot_{num}(k,\mathbb{Q})$ is a [[Tannakian category]] [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[category of representations]] of some [[algebraic group]] $GMot_k$:

$$
  Mot_{num}(k,\mathbb{Q}) \simeq Rep(GMot_k)
  \,.
$$

In the sense of [[Galois theory]], that [[algebraic group]] is called the _motivic Galois group_ for pure motives. There is also a motivic Galois group of mixed motives. 

See for instance ([Kahn](#Kahn)) for details and references.

That group is, or is closely related to, the group of algebraic _[[periods]]_, and as such is related to expressions appearing in [[deformation quantization]] and in [[renormalization]] in [[quantum field theory]], whence it is also sometimes referred to as the _[[cosmic Galois group]]_. See there for more on this.

## Properties

### Relation to Grothendieck-Teichmüller group

The [[Grothendieck-Teichmüller group]] is supposed to be a [[quotient]] of the motivic Galois group. This is a conjecture due to ([Drinfeld 91](#Drinfeld91)).

### General

A quick survey is in 

* [[Bruno Kahn]], _Motivic Galois groups_ ([pdf](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~kahn/preprints/PaloAlto2.pdf))
 {#Kahn}

A new approach by Ayoub in the setting of homotopy theory of schemes is
* [[Joseph Ayoub]], _L'algèbre de Hopf du groupe de Galois motivique_ ([pdf] (http://user.math.uzh.ch/ayoub/PDF-Files/GaloisMotivic-1.pdf)){#Ayoub}

More is in

> We show that the spectrum of Kontsevich's algebra of formal periods is a torsor under the motivic Galois group for mixed motives over the rational numbers. This assertion is stated without proof by Kontsevich and originally due to Nori. In a series of appendices, we also provide the necessary details on Nori's category of motives.

### Relation to Grothendieck-Teichmüller group

The Drinfeld conjeture is stated in

* [[Vladimir Drinfel'd]], _On quasi-triangular Quasi-Hopf algebras and a group closely related with $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Q}})$, Leningrad Math. J., 2 (1991), 829 - 860.
 {#Drinfeld91}


### In quantum field theory

A conjecture that the motivic Galois group naturally acts on the space of [[deformation quantizations]] of [[free field theories]] is in section 5 of 

* [[Maxim Kontsevich]], _Operads and motives in deformation quantization_, Lett. Math. Phys.48:35-72, 1999 ([arXiv:math/9904055](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9904055))

Regarding that this approach is related to Hodge theory periods, and that QFT can be attacked using the Batalin-Vilkovsky formalism, Barannikov has developed
further the Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry and related Hodge theory in a direction which is probably a ground for better understanding of motivic Galois group as well. 

An analogous statement, that a motivic Galois group naturally acts on structures in [[renormalization]] is in

* [[Alain Connes]], [[Matilde Marcolli]], _Renormalization and motivic Galois theory_, [arXiv:math/0409306](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409306)
