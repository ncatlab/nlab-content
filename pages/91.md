## Idea

Globular sets are to [[simplicial sets]] as [[globes]] are to simplices.


## Definition

A _globular set_, also called an _$\omega$-graph_ or _$\omega$-[[quiver]]_, is a [[presheaf]] on the _globe category_ (described below), one of the [[geometric shapes for higher structures]].

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark
The presheaf definition can understood from the point of view of [[space and quantity]]: a _globular set_ is a space characterized by the fact that and how it may be _probed_ by mapping standard globes into it: the set $S_n$ assigned by a globular set to the standard $n$-globe $[n]$ is the set of $n$-globes in this space, hence the way of mapping a standard $n$-globe into this spaces.
=--

The **[[globe category]]** $G$ is the category whose objects are the
non-negative integers and whose morphisms are generated from

$$
  \sigma_n : [n] \to [n+1]
$$
$$
  \tau_n : [n] \to [n+1]
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ subject to the relations (dropping obvious subscripts)

$$
  \sigma\circ \sigma = \tau \circ \sigma
$$
$$
  \sigma\circ \tau = \tau \circ \tau
$$

A **globular object** $S$ [[internalization|in]] a category $K$ is a
functor $S : G^{\mathrm{op}} \to K$.  In particular, for $K = Sets$ we
say $S$ is a **globular set**.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we write

$$
  S_n \coloneqq S(n) 
$$
$$
  s_n \coloneqq S(\sigma_n) : S_{n+1} \to S_{n}
$$
$$
  t_n \coloneqq S(\tau_n) : S_{n+1} \to S_{n}
$$
and call $S_n$ the **collection of $n$-cells**; $s_n$ the $(n+1)$st
**source map** and $t_n$ the $(n+1)$st **target map**.

The relations (dropping obvious subscripts)
$$
  s \circ s = s \circ t
$$
$$
  t \circ s = t \circ t
$$

are called the **globular identities**.

A morphism of globular objects is a natural transformation of the
corresponding functors.  For the resulting category of globular
objects in $K$ we write

$$
  GlobularObjects(K) := K^{G^{\mathrm{op}}}
$$

The category $GlobularObjects(Set)$ of globular sets is often written $GSet$ or $GlobSet$.


### Reflexive globular sets

If to the globe category we add additional generating morphisms

$$
  \iota_n : [n+1] \to [n]
$$

satisfying the relations

$$
  \iota \circ \sigma = \mathrm{Id}
$$
$$
  \iota \circ \tau = \mathrm{Id}
$$

we obtain the **reflexive globe category**, a presheaf on which is a
**reflexive globular set**.  In this case the morphism

$$
  i_n := S(\iota_n) : S_{n} \to S_{n+1}
$$

is called the $n$th **identity assigning map**; it satisfies the globular identities:

$$
  s \circ i = \mathrm{Id}
$$
$$
  t \circ i = \mathrm{Id}
$$


### $n$-globular sets

A presheaf on the full subcategory of the globe category containing only the integers $[0]$ through $[n]$ is called an **$n$-globular set** or an **$n$-graph** or an **$n$-quiver**.  An $n$-globular set may be identified with an $\infty$-globular set which is empty above dimension $n$.

Note that a $1$-globular set is just a [[quiver]], and a $0$-globular set is just a [[set]].


### Notation for composite globular maps

The globular identities ensure that

* two sequences of boundary maps
$$
  f_n \circ \cdots \circ f_{n+m-1} \circ f_{n+m} :
  S_{n+m+1} \to S_n
$$

with $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$ and for $f_k, \in \{s_k, t_k\}$ are
equal if and only if their last term $f_n$ coincides;

* for all $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$ we have

$$
    s_n \cdots s_{n+1} \circ \cdots \circ
    s_{n+m} \circ i_{n+m} \circ \cdots \circ i_{n+1} \circ i_n
    =
    \mathrm{Id}
  $$
  $$
    t_n \cdots t_{n+1} \circ \cdots \circ
    t_{n+m} \circ i_{n+m} \circ \cdots \circ i_{n+1} \circ i_n
    =
    \mathrm{Id}
    \,.
  $$

We therefore write

$$
  s_n, t_n : S_{n+m+1} \to S_n
$$
$$
  i_n : S_n \to S_{n+m+1}  
$$

with $i_n, s_n, t_m$ the sequence of $m$
consecutive identity-assigning, source or target maps, respectively.


## Examples

* Any [[strict 2-category]] or [[bicategory]] has an underlying 2-globular set.  Likewise, any [[tricategory]] has an underlying 3-globular set.  Globular sets can be used as underlying data for [[n-categories]] as well; see for instance [[Batanin ω-category]].

* The **globular $n$-globe** $G_n$ is the globular set represented by $n$, i.e. $G_n(-) := Hom_G(-,n)$.


## Remarks

* Globular sets are based on one of the three major [[geometric shapes for higher structures]].

* Also related is the notion of [[computad]], which is similar to a globular set in some ways, but allows "formal composites" of $n$-cells to appear in the sources and targest of $(n+1)$-cells.
