## Idea

In 19th century, noneuclidean geometries were found (Lobachevski, Bolya, Gauss) and mathematicians were reexamening the [[foundations]] of [[geometry]]; thus some schools concentrated on [[axiom|axiomatic]] build up of geometry,  independent from the tools which were offered by the [[models]] with concrete [[coordinate]] [[algebra of functions|algebras]]. Synthetic geometry in this sense referred to doing geometry without the recourse of [[algebras of functions]] and analytic computations. This was especially successful in [[projective geometry]], see _[[synthetic projective geometry]]_.

The main part of synthetic geometry is the study of incidence structures in geometry, sometimes also called [[incidence geometry]].

## Comparison to synthetic differential geometry
 {#ComparisonToSDG}

This perspective of synthetic geometry is somewhat different from the more modern subject called _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_, though the terminology has the same origin. Namely, regarding that in the axiomatic approach the emphasis is on the relation between the elements of geometry ([[points]], [[lines]], [[curves]]) and that in modern geometry those are viewed as subvarieties, hence [[subobjects]], in his original axiomatization of _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_ [[William Lawvere]] has reinterpreted the meaning of synthetic geometry as being concerned with categorical  relationship between geometrical objects. However, he was not concerned with working without analytic and algebraic calculations (which do appear in his axioms for [[infinitesimally thickened points]]); he just wanted to introduce the foundations internally. (But this is different for his later development of [[cohesion|cohesive geometry]] which includes the original synthetic differential geometry via _[[differential cohesion]]_. Here no analysis enters the [[axioms]].)


Lawvere also notes the  failure (for physical applications) of the correspondence between evolution paths and corresponding maps in differential geometry, and wanted to work in [[closed monoidal categories]] (having the [[exponential law]] for [[mapping spaces]]). In [[synthetic differential geometry]], which he created with Kock, Dubuc and others, this enabled also intuitive, pre-Cauchy reasoning with [[differentials]], what also reminded him of 19th century mathematics what probably also influenced on choosing the name. But still, the subject of synthetic differential geometry is non-synthetic in the sense of traditional 
synthetic geometry.
