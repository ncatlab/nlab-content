## Definition

A **suplattice** is a [[partial order|poset]] which has all [[joins]] (and in particular is a join-[[semilattice]]).  By the [[adjoint functor theorem]] for posets, a suplattice necessarily has all [[meet|meets]] as well and so is a [[complete lattice]].  However, a **suplattice homomorphism** preserves joins, but not necessarily meets.  Furthermore, a *[[proper class|large]]* semilattice which has all *small* joins need not have all meets, but might still be considered a large suplattice (even though it may not even be a lattice).

Dually, an __inflattice__ is a poset which has all [[meets]], and an __inflattice homomorphism__ in a monotone function that preserves all meets.

A __[[frame]]__ (dual to a [[locale]]) is a suplattice in which finitary meets distrubute over arbitrary joins.  (Frame homomorphisms preserve all joins and finitary meets.)

The [[category]] [[SupLat]] of suplattices and suplattice homomorphisms admits a [[tensor product]] which represents "bilinear maps," i.e. functions which preserve joins separately in each variable.  Under this tensor product, the category of suplattices is a [[star-autonomous category]] in which the dualizing object is the suplattice dual to the object $TV$ of [[truth-values]].  A [[monoid object|monoid]] in this [[monoidal category]] is a __[[quantale]]__, including [[frames]] as a special case.
