A **suplattice** is a [[partial order|poset]] which has all [[join|joins]].  By the [[adjoint functor theorem]] for posets, a suplattice necessarily has all [[meet|meets]] as well and so is a [[complete lattice]].  However, a **suplattice homomorphism** preserves joins, but not necessarily meets.

The category $Sup$ of suplattices and suplattice homomorphisms admits a [[tensor product]] which represents "bilinear maps," i.e. functions which preserve joins separately in each variable.  A monoid in this monoidal category is a [[quantale]], including [[frames]] as a special case.
