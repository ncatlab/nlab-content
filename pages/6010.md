## Definition

An _embedding of smooth manifolds_ is a [[smooth function]] $f : X \hookrightarrow Y$ such that

* $f$ is an [[immersion]]

* the underlyiing [[continuous function]] is an [[embedding]] of topological spaces.

## Properties

### Whitney embedding theorem

Every [[smooth manifold]] (of finite [[dimension]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and [[second countable space|second countable]]) has an embedding into a [[Cartesian space]].
