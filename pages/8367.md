Inductive reasoning concerns assessments of how likely a statement is to be true, given observations of its consequences.

Not everybody holds that such reasoning occurs. [[Karl Popper]] famously claimed that "Induction, i.e. inference based on many observations, is a myth. It is neither a psychological fact, nor a fact of ordinary life, nor one of scientific procedure." (Conjectures and Refutations, p. 53).

A common approach to formulate an _inductive_ logic is to couch inductive reasoning in terms of [[probability theory]]. It can be shown by so-called "Dutch Book" arguments, that a rational agent must set their degrees of belief in such a way that they satisfy the axioms of probability theory. For example, if one's degree of belief that the next toss of a coin will show heads is $p$, then one should believe it will show tails to degree $(1 - p)$, otherwise it will be possible for someone to take betting positions making a loss certain whatever the outcome.

Using Bayes' Rule, degrees of belief can be updated on receipt of new evidence.

$$
P(h|e) = P(e|h) \cdot \frac{P(h)}{P(e)},
$$

where $h$ is a hypothesis and $e$ is evidence.

The idea here is that when $e$ is observed, one's degree of belief in $h$ should be changed from $P(h)$ to $P(h|e)$. This is known as **conditionalizing**. If $P(h|e) \gt P(h)$, we say that $e$ has provided **confirmation** for $h$.

Interestingly, one of the first people to give a qualitative sketch of how such an approach would work was [[George Polya]] in 'Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning', where examples from mathematics are widely used. This surprises many, it being thought that mathematicians relied solely on [[deduction]].
