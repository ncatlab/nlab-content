## Idea

Recall that ( _geometric_ ) [[T-duality]] is an operation acting on tuples roughly consisting of

* a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ with the structure of a torus-[[principal bundle]] $T^n \to X \to X/T^n$ -- modelling [[spacetime]]

* equipped with a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] -- modelling the [[Kalb-Ramond field]]

* and in [[twisted K-theory]] refined to elements in [[differential K-theory|differential twisted K-theory]] -- modelling the [[RR-field]]
  
* and notably equipped with a (pseudo)[[Riemannian metric]] -- modelling the field of [[gravity]].

The idea of **topological T-duality** is to disregard the [[Riemannian metric]] and the connection and study the remaining "topological" structure.

While the idea of [[T-duality]] originates in [[string theory]], topological T-duality has become a field of study in pure mathematics in its own right. 

In the language of [[bi-brane]]s a topological T-duality transformation is a bi-brane of a special kind between the two gerbes involved. The induced pull-push operation (in [[groupoidification]] and [[geometric function theory]]) on (sheaves of sections of, or K-classes of) (twisted) vector bundles is essentially the Fourier--Mukai transformation. More on the bi-brane interpretation of (topological and non-topological) T-duality is in _SarkissianSchweigert08_.


## Definition

Two tuples $(X_i \to B, G_i)_{i = 1,2}$ consisting of a $T^n$-bundle $X_i$ over a manifold $B$ and a line [[bundle gerbe]] $G_i \to X_i$ over $X$ are **topological T-duals** if there exists an isomorphism $u$ of the two line bundle gerbes pulled back to the [[fiber product]] correspondence space $X_1 \times_B X_2$:

$$
  \array{
    && pr_1^* G_1 && \stackrel{u}{\leftarrow}
    && pr_2^* G_2
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow && \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    G_1 &&&& X_1 \times_B X_2 &&&& G_2
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow && \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X_1 &&&& X_2
    \\
    &&& \searrow &&& \swarrow
    \\
    &&&& B
  }
$$

## References

The simplest version of topological T-duality, when $X$ is a principal circle bundle, was originally developed in 

* [[Peter Bouwknegt]]-[[Jarah Evslin]]-[[Varghese Mathai]] ([hep-th/0306062](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0306062)) 

and the torus bundle case was introduced in 

* Bouwknegt-Hannabus-Mathai [hep-th/0312284](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0312284). 

In these papers the gerbe does not appear, but an integral 3-form, representing the Dixmier-Douady class of a gerbe does. Note that if the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|integral]] [[cohomology group]] $H^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$ of $X$ has [[torsion]] in dimension three, not all gerbes will arise in this way. The formalization with the above data originates in
