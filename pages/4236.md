An (left, right, two-sided) [[ideal]] of ring (or $k$-algebra) $R$ is a (left, right, bi) $R$-submodule of $R$ itself. One can consider similarly the notion of a [[presheaf of modules]] over a presheaf of rings: and the presheaf of ideals is then the presheaf of submodules of a presheaf of rings. 

In algebraic geometry, [[quasicoherent sheaves]] of modules are of special importance; thus also quasicoherent ideals as those ideals which are quasicoherent as sheaves of modules.  An important example of a quasicoherent sheaf of ideals is the [[defining sheaf of ideals]] of a [[closed subscheme]]. 

Wikipedia uses less preferrable term [ideal sheaf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_sheaf). 

Having a [[finitary monad]] $T$ in the category of sets, the [[sheafification functor]] from the category of presheaves of sets to the category of sheaves of sets, can be strictly lifted to the category of presheaves of $T$-modules (or, if you like, $T$-algebras) to the category of sheaves of $T$-modules. More generally, one can consider sheaves of finitary monads and corresponding categories of sheaves of modules and of bimodules. The discussions of sheaves of ideals extends easily to this setting.
