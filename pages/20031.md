Brownian motion is an example of a [[stochastic process]]. Brownian motion $B_t$ is a stochastic process on $[0,\infty)$ with the following properties:

* $B_0=0$ almost surely.

* The increments $B_t-B_s$ are independent and normally distributed $N(0,t-s)$ for $t \gt s$.

* The function $t\mapsto B_t$ is continuous.
