## Idea

A _trialgebra_ is meant to be a structure at least similar to or involving an [[associative algebra]] but equipped with two further compatible algebra structures, the first additional one making it a [[bialgebra]], the second one making it then a trialgebra.

In the spirit of [[Tannaka duality]], this is to be such that the [[category of modules]] of the associative algebra underlying the trialgebra inherits the structure not just of a [[monoidal category]] (as it does for a bialgebra), but even of a [[Hopf monoidal category]].

Notice that next the [[2-category]] of [[module categories]] over a [[Hopf monoidal category]] inherits the structure of a [[monoidal 2-category]]. This finally has a [[3-category]] of module 2-categories. 

In the spirit of _[[n-modules]]_ by iterated internalization, this 3-category may be thought of as the [[4-module]] (over the groun field), presented by the trialgebra.

Accordingly, trialgebras may be thought of as 4-[[bases]] for [[spaces of quantum states]] of [[extended TQFTs|extended]] [[4d TQFTs]] . This has been the main motivation for considering them in ([Pfeiffer 04](#Pfeiffer)) (not quite in the above language), in turn forming a 2-basis for the correspondinf [[Hopf monoidal categories]] in ([Crane-Frenkel 04](#CraneFrenkel)). A review of related literature is in ([Baez-Lauda 09, p. 98](#BaezLauda))
