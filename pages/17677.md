##Idea
Philosophers have sought a means to isolate the properly [[logic|logical]] components of a language from the remainder. A prominent idea here has been to use invariance under arbitrary permutations of the domain of objects. Some, e.g., Mautner and Tarski, have seen this as an extension of the [[Erlangen program]] of [[Felix Klein]], which looked to distinguish geometries by their invariance under different transformation groups. Logic is now to be seen as the maximally invariant theory.

In the propositional case, consider the [[symmetric group]], $S_n$, acting on a set, $X$, of cardinality $n$. Then it also acts on all cartesian powers, $X^k$. Subsets of $X^k$ are $k$-ary [[relations]], and those invariant under $S_n$ are unions of the [[orbits]] of its action. The idea then is that such relations are definable using only logical constants.

[[Steve Awodey]] has argued that [[homotopy type theory]] should be seen in a similar light as expressing invariance under [[equivalence]].
