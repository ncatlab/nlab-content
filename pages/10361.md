## Idea

In its standard formulation, [[quantum physics]] is a probabilistic theory of nature, since it provides only [[probabilities]] (in fact [[probability amplitudes]]) for [[observable]] to obtain certain values in [[experiment]]. This is in contrast to [[classical mechanics]], which (on classical [[pure states]]) predicts events with certainty. 

However, on very small scales classical mechanics predicts the _wrong_ events, while [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] predicts the right [[probabilities]].

On the other hand, it is well known that upon "coarse graining", which means after avraging over certain details, also classical mechanics induces a probabilistic theory of nature, namely [[statistical mechanics]]/[[thermodynamics]].

Therefore it is natural to speculate that maybe also [[quantum physics]] is the [[statistical mechanics]] of a more refined theory of as yet unseen "degrees of freedom of nature" on small scales, which does predict events with certainty, and which reduced to quantum mechanics as one averages over these unseen new degrees of freedom.

These "unseen degrees of freedom" are usually called _hidden variables_ and a [[theory (physics)|theory]] which is non-probabilistic but designed to reproduce [[quantum mechanics]] as a statistical theory are called _hidden variable theories_.

There have been various attempts to construct such hidden variable theories. However, there are also [[theorems]] about the characteristic properties of [[quantum mechanics]] which asserts (under some (natural) assumptions, of course) that there cannot be a hidden variable theory.

These theorems are

* [[Bell's inequalities]] ([Bell 64](#Bell64));

* the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]] ([Kochen-Specker 68](#KochenSpecker68)).

One well-developed attempt to construct a hidden variable theory is [[Bohmian mechanics]]; this makes hidden variables out of the entire [[wavefunction]] and violates the assumption of [[locality]].
