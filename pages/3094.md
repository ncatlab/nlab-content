## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$ in the sense of ([Bourbaki 71](#Bourbaki71)) (that is, a set $X$ and a topology $\tau_X$) and a [[subset]] $Y$ of $X$, a topology $\tau_Y$ on $Y$ is said to be the topology **induced** from $\tau_X$ by the [[inclusion function|set inclusion]] $Y \hookrightarrow X$ if $\tau_Y = \tau_X \cap_{pw} \{Y\} \coloneqq \{ U \cap Y | U\in\tau_X\}$. In other words, $\tau_Y$ is the smallest topology on $Y$ such that the inclusion $Y \hookrightarrow X$ is [[continuous map|continuous]] (the [[initial topology]] on that map). The pair $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is then said to be a *topological [[subspace]]* of $(X,\tau_X)$. The induced topology is for that reason sometimes called the **subspace topology** on $Y$. 

A subspace $i: Y \hookrightarrow X$ is **closed** if $Y$ is closed as a subset of $X$ (or if $i$ is a [[closed map]]), and is **open** if $Y$ is open as a subset of $X$ (or if $i$ is an [[open map]]). 

A property of topological spaces is said to be **hereditary** if its satisfaction for a topological space $X$ implies its satisfaction for all topological subspaces of $X$. 

## Properties

###### Proposition 

Topological subspace inclusions are precisely the [[regular monomorphisms]] in [[Top]].

For example, the [[equalizer]] of two maps $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\to}{\to} Y$ in [[Top]] is computed as the equalizer at the underlying-set level, equipped with the subspace topology.

###### Lemma 
The [[pushout]] in [[Top]] of any (closed/open) subspace $i \colon A \hookrightarrow B$ along any [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \to C$ is a (closed/open) subspace $j: C \hookrightarrow D$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Since $U = \hom(1, -): Top \to Set$ is [[faithful functor|faithful]], we have that monos are reflected by $U$; also monos and pushouts are preserved by $U$ since $U$ has both a [[left adjoint]] and a [[right adjoint]]. In $Set$, the pushout of a mono along any map is a mono, so we conclude $j$ is monic in $Top$. Furthermore, such a pushout diagram in $Set$ is also a pullback, so that we have the [[Beck-Chevalley condition|Beck-Chevalley equality]] $\exists_i \circ f^\ast = g^\ast \exists_j \colon P(C) \to P(B)$ (where $\exists_i \colon P(A) \to P(B)$ is the [[direct image]] map between [[power sets]], and $f^\ast: P(C) \to P(A)$ is the [[inverse image]] map). 

To prove that $j$ is a subspace, let $U \subseteq C$ be any open set. Then there exists open $V \subseteq B$ such that $i^\ast(V) = f^\ast(U)$ because $i$ is a subspace inclusion. If $\chi_U \colon C \to \mathbf{2}$ and $\chi_V \colon B \to \mathbf{2}$ are the maps to [[Sierpinski space]] that classify these open sets, then by the universal property of the pushout, there exists a unique continuous map $\chi_W \colon D \to \mathbf{2}$ which extends the pair of maps $\chi_U, \chi_V$. It follows that $j^{-1}(W) = U$, so that $j$ is a subspace inclusion. 

If moreover $i$ is an open inclusion, then for any open $U \subseteq C$ we have that $j^\ast(\exists_j(U)) = U$ (since $j$ is monic) and (by Beck-Chevalley) $g^\ast(\exists_j(U)) = \exists_i(f^\ast(U))$ is open in $B$. By the definition of the topology on $D$, it follows that $\exists_j(U)$ is open, so that $j$ is an open inclusion. The same proof, replacing the word "open" with the word "closed" throughout, shows that the pushout of a closed inclusion $i$ is a closed inclusion $j$.

A similar (but even simpler) line of argument establishes the following result. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #transfinite} 
###### Lemma 
Let $\kappa$ be an [[ordinal]], viewed as a [[preorder]] category, and let $F: \kappa \to Top$ be a functor that preserves [[directed colimits]]. Then if $F(i \leq j)$ is a (closed/open) subspace inclusion for each morphism $i \leq j$ of $\kappa$, then the canonical map $F(0) \to colim_{i \in \kappa} F(i)$ is also a (closed/open) inclusion. 
=-- 

## Variations

There is also a notion of a [[Grothendieck topology]] induced along a [[functor]] from a Grothendieck topology on another category (actually the input can be a somewhat more general [[coverage]], then the topology induced along the [[identity functor]] will serve as a sort of a completion). (this will be explained later).

A topology may be induced by more than a [[function]] other than a subset inclusion, or indeed by a family of functions out of $Y$ (not necessarily all with the same [[target]]). However, the term 'induced topology' is often (usually?) restricted to subspaces; the general concept is called a [[weak topology]].  (This construction can be done in any [[topological concrete category]]; in this generality it is often called an [[initial structure]] for a [[sink|source]].)  The dual construction (involving functions to $Y$) is a [[strong topology]] (or [[final structure]] for a [[sink]]); an example is the [[quotient topology]] on a [[quotient space]].
