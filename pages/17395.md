##Idea

**Relevance logics**, also known as **relevant logics**, are non-classical logics designed to avoid what some consider to be paradoxical about classical [[implication]].  In particular, certain hypothetical propositions in which antecedent and consequent are irrelevant to one another occur as [[tautologies]] in [[classical logic]], whereas one might consider that a claim that '$P$ implies $Q$' suggests that the truth of $P$ gives us reason to accept the truth of $Q$.
