* [[William Lawvere]],

  _Toposes of laws of motion_ , 

  transcript of a talk in Montreal, Sept. 1997 

  ([pdf](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/ToposMotion.pdf))

on the formulation of [[differential equations]]/[[continuum mechanics]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and the notion of [[toposes of laws of motion]].

Another early text in this direction is Lawvere's _[[Categorical dynamics]]_. Related texts on the [[foundations]] of [[physics]] in [[topos theory]] include the collection _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_.

An open question concerning the characterization of "Toposes of laws of motion" is raised as question 7 "The algebra of time" in

* _Open problems in topos theory_, April 2009 ([pdf](http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/pssl88/lawvere.pdf))


Entries with related discussion include _[[geometry of physics]]_ and _[[higher category theory and physics]]_.
