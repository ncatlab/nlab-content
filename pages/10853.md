* [[William Lawvere]],

  _Toposes of laws of motion_ , 

  transcript of a talk in Montreal, Sept. 1997 

  ([pdf](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/ToposMotion.pdf))

on the formulation of [[differential equations]]/[[continuum mechanics]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]].

Another early text in this direction is Lawvere's _[[Categorical dynamics]]_. Related texts on the [[foundations]] of [[physics]] in [[topos theory]] include the collection _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_.

Entries with related discussion include _[[geometry of physics]]_ and _[[higher category theory and physics]]_.

## Laws of motion

[[actions]] of an [[group object]], forming the [[topos]] of [[actions]]

From p. 9:

> Likewise, the infinitesimal version of such systems i.e. vector fields or first-order ODE’s, will also form a topos as I pointed out in my Chicago lecture. But what about actual dynamical systems in the spirit of [[Galileo]], for example, second-order ODE’s? (Of course, the symplectic or Hamiltonian systems that are also much studied do address this question of states of Becoming versus locations of Being, but in a special way which it may not be possible to construe as a topos;
