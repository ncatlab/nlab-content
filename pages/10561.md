Identities of Bol-Moufang type are 60 4-th order identities for a binary algebraic operation which include left and right Bol identities and the three Moufang identities. The identities follow from associativity but are weaker than associativity; in the case of loops some of them do imply associativity. 

4 general elements $x,y,z,w$ in the fixed order can be bracketed in 5 ways: $(xy)(zw), x((yz)w), (x(yz))w, ((xy)z)w, x(y(zw))$. If the two of the 4 elements are the same (hence we have $a,a,b,c$ than we can order them in 6 ways such that $b$ and $c$ are in fixed order. Bol-Moufang identities are obtained that we take general elements $a,a,b,c$ with $b$ before $c$ (for definiteness) and form 4 th order monomial in any bracketing and equate it with different bracketing. 
For example, $(ab)(ac) = a((ba)c)$. We can do this in 5 choose 2 times 6 ways, hence 60 ways. Requiring different sets among Bol-Moufang identities in a quasigroup or in a loop one gets some interesting classes of quasigroups and loops, for example, [[Bol loop]]s, [[Moufang loop]]s and some others.
