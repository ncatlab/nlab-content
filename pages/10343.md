## Idea

As opposed to ordinary [[Minkowski spacetime]], [[super Minkowski spacetime]] has, when regarded as the [[super translation Lie algebra]], exceptional [[cocycles]]. The [[super L-infinity algebra]] extensions classified by these serve as _extended super-spacetimes_ which are [[target spaces]] for super $p$-[[branes]].
