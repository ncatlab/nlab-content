Recall that in a [[category]] $C$, each pair of [[object]]s $x$ and $y$ determines a [[set]] $C(x,y)$, the [[hom-set]] of $x$ and $y$.  In a $2$-[[2-category|category]] $B$, each pair of objects determines a _category_ $B(x,y)$.  This category is the __hom-category__ of $x$ and $y$.

As a $2$-category is [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Cat]], a hom-category is a special case of a [[hom-object]].  But the hom-category makes sense also for the weakly enriched concept of [[bicategory]].
