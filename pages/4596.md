## Idea

Generally, a _connecting homomorphism_ is a [[morphism]] of the kind produced by the [[snake lemma]]. 

Specifically, when the [[double complex]] that goes into the snake lemma is regarded as part of a [[short exact sequence]] $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet$ of [[chain complexes]], then the connecting homomorphisms induce morphisms $\delta_n : H_n(C) \to H_{n-1}(A)$ on the [[homology groups]] of these chain complexes which exhibit the corresponding [[long exact sequence in homology]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
   \to
  H_n(A) \to H_n(B) \to H_n(C) 
   \stackrel{\delta_n}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(A) \to H_{n-1}(B) \to H_{n-1}(C)   
   \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

This long exact sequence is the image under [[chain homology]]

$$
  H_0(-) : Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to \mathcal{A}
$$

of the long [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of chain complexes induced by the short exact sequence. Hence the connecting homomorphism is the image under $H_\bullet(-)$ of a [[mapping cocone]] inclusion on chain complexes.


## Description for long homology exact sequences 

The construction of the connecting homomorphism is easily described in terms of elements in the case that $\mathcal{A} \simeq R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$, see [In terms of elements](#OnHomologyInTermsOfElements) below. By the [embedding theorems](abelian%20category#EmbeddingTheorems) the general case can be reduced to this case. But there is also an abstract construction without recourse to elements, see the [General abstract construction](#OnHomologyGeneralAbstract) below.

### In terms of elements
 {#OnHomologyInTermsOfElements}

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]]. Write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the [[category of chain complexes]] in $\mathcal{A}$.

Let

$$
  0 \to A_\bullet \stackrel{i}{\to} B_\bullet \stackrel{p}{\to}  C_\bullet \to 0
$$

be a [[short exact sequence]] in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, define a map

$$
  \delta_n : H_n(C) \to H_{n-1}(A)
$$

by sending

$$
  \delta_n : [c] \mapsto \widehat{[\partial^B \hat c]}
  \,,
$$

where 

1. $c \in Z_n(C)$ is a [[cycle]] representing a given [[homology group]]; 

1. $\hat c \in C_n(B)$ is any lift of that cycle to an element in $B_n$, which exists because $p$ is a [[surjection]] (but which no longer needs to be a cycle itself);

1. $\widehat{[\partial^B \hat c]}$ is any lift of $\partial^B \hat c$ to $C_{n-1}(A)$, which exists uniquely by exactness (since $p(\partial^B \hat c) = \partial^C p(\hat c) = \partial^C c = 0$) and which is indeed in $Z_{n-1}(A)$ since $\partial^A \widehat{[\partial^B \hat c]} = \partial^B \partial^B \hat c = 0$.

###### Proposition

Def. \ref{ConnectingForHomologyInComponents} is indeed well in that 
the given map is independent of the choices involved.

###### Definition

For $[c]_C \in H^n(C)$ the class of a closed element $c$, by surjectivity of $B \to C$ there is an element $\hat c \in B$ mapping to it. This need not be closed anymore, but of course $d_B \hat c$ is. By the fact that $B \to C$ is a chain map we have that the image of $d_B \hat c$ in $C$ vanishes. Therefore by the exactness of the sequence the element $d_B \hat c$ may be regarded as a closed element of $A$. The cohomology class $[d_B \hat c]_A$ of this is what the connecting homomorphism assigns to $[c]_C$:

$$
  \delta : [c]_C \mapsto [d_B\hat c]_A
  \,.
$$

This is indeed well defined, in that it is independent of the choice of $\hat c$: for $\hat c'$ another choice, we have that the difference $\hat c - \hat c'$ is in the kernel of $B \to C$ hence is in $A$. Then $d_B \hat c' = d_B \hat C + d_A(\hat c - \hat c')$. Hence $[d_B \hat c]_A = [d_B \hat c']_A$.

###### Theorem

Let $0 \to A_\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to} B_\bullet \stackrel{g}{\to} C_\bullet \to 0$
be a [[short exact sequence]] of [[chain complexes]] in some [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$. Then for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ there are natural _connecting homomorphisms_ $\partial : H_n(C) \to H_{n-1}(A)$ such that we have a [[long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots \stackrel{g}{\to}
  H_{n+1}(C)
  \stackrel{\partial}{\to}
  H_n(A)
  \stackrel{f}{\to}
  H_n(B)
  \stackrel{g}{\to}
  H_n(C)
  \stackrel{\partial}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(A)
  \stackrel{f}{\to}
  \cdots
$$

in [[chain homology]].

###### Proof

A proof not using the [[Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem]] can proceed as follows.

Applying the [[snake lemma]] to the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     && 0 && 0 && 0   
     \\
     && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     0 &\to& Z_n A &\to& Z_n B &\to & Z_n C
     \\
     && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     0 &\to& A_n &\to& B_n &\to & C_n &\to & 0 
     \\
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d}}     
     \\
     0 &\to& A_{n-1} &\to& B_{n-1} &\to & C_{n-1} &\to& 0
     \\
     && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     0 &\to& \frac{A_{n-1}}{im(d)(A_n)} &\to& \frac{B_{n-1}}{im(d)(B_n)} &\to & \frac{C_{n-1}}{im(d)(C_n)} &\to & 0 
     \\
     && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     && 0 && 0 && 0     
  }
$$

shows that the rows in the commuting diagram


$$
  \array{
      && \frac{A_{n}}{im(d)(A_{n+1})} &\to& \frac{B_{n}}{im(d)(B_{n+1})} &\to & \frac{C_{n}}{im(d)(C_{n+1})} &\to & 0 
      \\
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d}}     
     \\
     0 &\to& Z_{n-1} A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Z_{n-1} B &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z_{n-1} C
  }
$$

are [[exact sequences]]. Therefore applying the [[snake lemma]] to this, once more, yields the desired long exact sequence.
