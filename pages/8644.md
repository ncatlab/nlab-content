## Idea

In [[QCD]] [[instanton]] configurations of the [[gauge field]] control the experimentally observed [[vacuum]] structure of the theory.

One considers QCD on a [[Minkowski spacetime]] [[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]] to a Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^4$ and assumes the [[field strength]] to vanish beyond some finite radius. This makes the gauge field configurations be equivalently $SU(3)$-[[principal connections]] on the 4-[[sphere]] $S^4$. The [[second Chern class]] of the underlying $SU(3)$-[[principal bundle]] is called the [[Yang-Mills instanton]]-number of the gauge field configuration. The theoretical/experimentally observed [[vacuum]] of [[QCD]] is some [[superposition]] of gauge fields in various instanton number sectors.

In particular the **instanton liquid model** in QCD assumes that the [[vacuum]] (ground state of QCD) is populated by instanton field configurations of average radius $1/3 fm$ ([[femtometres]]) with a density of 1 such instanton per $fm^4$. Some details of this model remain subtle, see for instance ([Schaefer-Shuryak](#SchaeferShuryak)) for a good survey.
