## Idea

A _partition of unity_ is a [[partition]] of the unit function on a [[topological space]] into a sum of continuous functions that are each non-zero only on small parts of the space.


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. A (point finite) **partition of unity** on $X$ is a collection $\{u_j\}_J$ of [[continuous function]]s $u_j:X \to [0,1]$, $j\in J$ such that

 1. $\sum_J u_j(x) = 1$ for all $x\in X$
 2. For each $x\in X$, there is only a finite number of $j\in J$ such that $u_j(x) \neq 0$ (point finiteness condition).

A partition of unity defines an [[open cover]] of $X$, consisting of the open sets $u_j^{-1}(0,1]$. Call this the **induced cover**.

Sometimes (rarely) the condition that $\{u_j\}_J$ is point finite is dropped. In this case we refer to a _non-point finite_ partition of unity (see [[red herring principle]]).

Given a [[cover]] $\mathcal{U} = \{U_j\}_{j\in J}$ of a [[topological space]] (open or closed or neither), the partition of unity $\{u_j\}_J$ is **subordinate** to $\mathcal{U}$ if for all $j\in J$,
$$
\overline{u_j^{-1}(0,1]} \subset U_j.
$$

What this means is that the open sets $u_j^{-1}(0,1]$ form an open cover _refining_ the cover $\mathcal{U}$.


## Properties

[[Paracompact spaces]] have the property that every [[open cover]] has a subordinate partition of unity.

[[Normal spaces]] have the property that every [[locally finite cover]] has a subordinate partition of unity.

The last two are actually characterisations of paracompact resp. normal spaces (reference Bourbaki, Topology Generale - find this!)

Paracompact [[smooth manifolds]] have _smooth_ partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover (this follows from the existence of a smooth [[bump function]] on $[-1,1]$). It is not true, however, that analytic manifolds have analytic partitions of unity - the aforementioned [[bump function]] is smooth but not analytic.


### From a non-point finite partition of unity to a partition of unity

###### Definition

A collection of functions $\mathcal{U} = \{u_i : X \to [0,1]\}$ such that every $x\in X$ is in the support of some $u_i$. Then $\mathcal{U}$ is called _locally finite_ if the cover $u_i^{-1}(0,1]$ (i.e. the induced cover) is [[locally finite cover|locally finite]].

###### Proposition
(Mather, 1965)

Let $\{u_i\}_J$ be a non-point finite partition of unity. Then there is a locally finite partition of unity $\{v_i\}_{i\in J}$ such that the induced cover of the latter is a refinement of the induced cover of the former.
=--

(For a proof, see p.354 of Dold's Lectures on algebraic topology.)

This implies that (loc. finite) [[numerable covers]] are cofinal in induced covers arising from collections of functions as in the definition. In particular, given the [[Milnor classifying space]] $\mathcal{B}^M G$ of a [[topological group]] $G$, which comes with a countable family of 'coordinate functions' $\mathcal{B}^M G \to [0,1]$, has a numerable cover. This is shown by Dold to be a trivialising cover for the universal bundle constructed by Milnor, and so the universal bundle is [[numerable bundle|numerable]].


## Applications 

### Maps to geometric realizations

Partitions of unity can be used in constructing maps from spaces to [[geometric realization]]s of [[simplicial spaces]] (incl. simplicial sets) - for example a [[classifying map]] for a $G$-[[bundle]] where $G$ is a [[Lie group]].


### Coboundaries for Cech cocycles {#CechCoboundaries}

Partitions of unity can be used to give explicit coboundaries for the cocycles of the complex of functions on a cover.

Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a [[open cover]] and $\{\rho_i \in C(X,\mathbb{R})\}$ a collection of functions with

* $(x not \in U_i) \Rightarrow \rho_i(x) = 0$

* $\sum_i \rho_i = const_1$.

Write $C(\{U_i\}) : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ for the [[Cech nerve]] of the cover and $C(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbb{R})$ for the [[cosimplicial ring]] of functions on this [[simplicial object|simplicial]] topological space; and $(C_\bullet(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbb{R}), \delta)$ for the corresponding (normalized) [[Moore complex|cochain complex]]: its differential is the alternating sum of the pullbacks of functions along the face maps, i.e. along the restriction maps

$$
  \delta = \sum_k (-1)^k \delta_{k}^*
  \,.
$$

For instance for $f = \{f_{i_1, i_2, \cdots, i_n} \in C(U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_{n+1}})\}$ a collection of functions in degree $n$, we have

$$
  (\delta f)_{i_0 \cdots i_n i_{n+1}} =
  \sum_{k = 0}^{n+1} (-1)^k f_{i_0 \cdots i_{k-1} i_{k+1} \cdots i_{n+1}}
  \,.
$$ 

This cochain complex has vanishing [[cochain cohomology]] in positive degree. We can explicitly construct corresponding coboundaries using the partion of unity:

assume that with the above notation $f$ is a cocycle in positive degree, in that $\delta f  = 0$. Then define the $(n-1)$-cochain

$$
  \lambda_{i_1 \cdots i_n}
  :=
  \sum_{i_0} \rho_{i_0} f_{i_0 i_1 \cdots i_n}
  \,.
$$

Here in the summands on the right the product is defined on $U_{i_0} \cap U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_n}$ and extended as 0 to all of $U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_n}$.

With this definition we have

$$
  \delta \lambda = f
  \,.
$$

To see this we compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (\delta \lambda)_{i_1 \cdots i_{n+1}}
    & :=
    \sum_{i_0} \rho_{i_0} \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k f_{i_0 i_1 \cdots i_{k-1} i_{k+1} \cdots i_{n+1}}
    \\
    & =
    \pm 
    \sum_{i_0} \rho_{i_0} 
    f_{i_1 \cdots i_{n+1}}
    \\
    & = f_{i_1 \cdots i_{n+1}}
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the second step we used the condition $\delta f = 0$ and in the last step we used the property of the partition of unity.

This construction is used a lot in [[Cech cohomology]]. For instance it can be used to show in Chech cocycles that every [[principal bundle]] admits a [[connection on a bundle]] (see there for the details).
