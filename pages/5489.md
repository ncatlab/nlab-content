Often in mathematics, when requiring some structure/operation/property/... to exist at every finite [[arity]], it suffices to require only the binary (2-ary) and nullary (0-ary) forms, from which the others follow.

For example, in defining a [[category]], one could use an "unbiased" definition in which composites of all finite sequences of morphisms are directly postulated, with corresponding associativity laws, but it suffices to require only binary composites and nullary composites (i.e., identity morphisms) and some particular corresponding associativity laws.

As a special case of this, we have perhaps the prototypical example of a binary/nullary pair sufficing to generate all finite instances of some structure: the [[natural numbers]] themselves are the free [[monoid]] on one generator, and thus are freely associatively produced from that one generator (aka, 1) using only binary and nullary addition.
