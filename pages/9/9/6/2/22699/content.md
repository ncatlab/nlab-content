## Idea

There should be a commutative version of a [[invertible magma]]. That leads to the concept of a _commutative invertible magma_. 

## Definition

A __commutative invertible magma__ is a [[magma]] $(G,(-)\cdot(-):G\times G\to G)$ with a unary operation $(-)^{-1}:G \to G$ called the __inverse__ such that 

* $a \cdot (b \cdot b^{-1}) = a$

for all $a,b \in G$. 

## Examples

* Every [[commutative loop]] is a commutative invertible [[unital magma]]. 

* Every commutative invertible quasigroup is a commutative invertible magma. 

* Every [[abelian group]] is a commutative invertible monoid.

* The empty magma is a commutative invertible magma.
