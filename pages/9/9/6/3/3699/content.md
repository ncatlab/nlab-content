[[!redirects Markov chains]]
A Markov chain is a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor|coalgebra]] for the [[endofunctor]] on [[Set]] which maps a set $X$ to the set of [[probability distribution|probability distributions]] on $X$.

[[Ian Durham]]: I assume that a Markov chain can be represented as a directed graph in some way and thus can be used to generate a free category of some sort.  Is this a correct assumption?

[[Eric]]: I'm pretty sure that is the case for _finite_ Markov chains.
