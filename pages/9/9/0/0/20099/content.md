## Idea

An [[experiment]]/[[measurement]] is said to produce a _null result_ if it supports the [[null hypothesis]], typically in that the result has low [[statistical significance]].

## Examples

### Null results in physics

Historically important null results in [[physics]]:

* [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] led to development of [[special relativity]], thus of [[general relativity]] and the modern [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[gravity]].

* absence of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] predicted by $H_0 = $ [[classical field theory|classical]] [[electromagnetism]]] led to the hypothesis of [[energy]]/[[frequency]]-quantization (now expressed by [[Plancks's constant]]) and hence to the development of [[quantum physics]]
