## Idea

The notion of _Weil algebra_ is ordinarily defined for a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$. It may be understood as the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the tangent [[Lie 2-algebra]] $T \mathfrak{g}$ or $inn(\mathfrak{g})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, generalizing the notion of [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T X$ from a 0-[[truncated]] Lie algebroid $X$ (a [[smooth manifold]]) to the one-obeject [[Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{g}$.

Generally, for every [[Lie-∞-algebroid]] $\mathfrak{a}$ one may define the corresponding tangent Lie-$\infty$-algebroid $T \mathfrak{a}$ , whose Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra may be called the Weil algebra of $\mathfrak{a}$:

$$
  W(\mathfrak{a})
  =
  CE(T \mathfrak{a})
  \,.
$$



### Weil algebra of a Lie algebra 

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]]. The **Weil algebra** $W(\mathfrak{g})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ is

* the graded [[Grassmann algebra]] generated from the dual [[vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^*$ together with another copy of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ shifted in degree

  $$
    W(\mathfrak{g}) := \wedge^\bullet 
   (\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1])
  $$

* equipped with a [[derivation]] $d : W(\mathfrak{g}) \to W(\mathfrak{g})$ that makes this a [[dg-algebra]], defined by the fact that on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ it acts as the differential of the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ plus the degree shift morphism $\mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^*$.

This Weil algebra has trivial [[chain homology and cohomology|cohomology]] and sits in a sequence

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{g})
  \leftarrow inv(\mathfrak{g})
$$

with the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ and its algebra of [[invariant polynomial]]s on $\mathfrak{g}$. This may be understood as a model for the sequence of algebras of differential forms on the [[generalized universal bundle|universal G-bundle]]

$$
  G \to \mathcal{E}G \to \mathcal{B}G
  \,.
$$

As such, the Weil algebra plays a crucial role in the study of the [[Lie algebra cohomology]] of $\mathfrak{g}$.


## Definition

Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a [[∞-Lie algebroid]], identified with its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{a}) = \wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(\mathfrak{a}_0)} \mathfrak{a}_{\geq 1}^* $. 

The corresponding **Weil algebra** is

$$
  \mathrm{W}(\mathfrak{a})
  := CE(T \mathfrak{a})
  :=
  \left(
    \wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(\mathfrak{a}_0)}
    (
      \mathfrak{a}_{\geq 1}^* \oplus \Gamma(T^* \mathfrak{a}_0) 
      \oplus \mathfrak{a}_{\geq 1}^*[1]
    )
    , d_{\mathrm{W}(\mathfrak{a})}
  \right)
$$

where the differential acts as the de Rham differential on $\wedge^\bullet \Gamma(T^* \mathfrak{a}_0)$ and is defined on generators in $\mathfrak{a}^* \oplus \mathfrak{a}^*[1]$ by 

$$
  d_{\mathrm{W}(\mathfrak{a})}
  =
  \left(
    \array{
       d_{\mathrm{CE}(\mathfrak{a})}
       &
       0
       \\
       \sigma
       &
       - \sigma \circ d_{\mathrm{CE}(\mathfrak{a})}
       \circ \sigma^{-1}
    }
    \,,
  \right)
$$

where $\sigma|_{\mathfrak{a}^*} : \mathfrak{a}^* \to \mathfrak{a}^*[1]$ is the canonical degree-shifting isomorphism, and in $\sigma \circ d_{\mathrm{CE}(\mathfrak{a})} \circ \sigma^{-1}$ its left appearance is its extension as a degree +1 [[derivation]].

## Properties {#Properties}

The main point of the definition is that the differential restricted to the original (unshifted) generators is the original differential plus the shift:

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{a})} |_{\mathfrak{a}^*} = d_{CE(\mathfrak{a})} + \sigma
  \,.
$$

By solving the condition $d_{W(\mathfrak{a})} \circ d_{W(\mathfrak{a})} = 0$ and using that $d_{CE(\mathfrak{a})} d_{CE(\mathfrak{a})} = 0$ this already fixes uniquely the differential $d_{W(\mathfrak{a})} \sigma t$ on the shifted generators $\sigma(t) \in \mathfrak{a}^*[1]$. For one computes:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    0 & =
    d_{W(\mathfrak{a})}(d_{W(\mathfrak{a})} t)
    \\
    & = 
    d_{W(\mathfrak{a})}(d_{CE(\mathfrak{a})}t + \sigma t)
    \\
    & = \sigma d_{CE(\mathfrak{a})} t + d_{W(\mathfrak{a}) } \sigma t
  \end{aligned}
$$

and hence

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{a})} \sigma t = - \sigma d_{CE(\mathfrak{a})} \sigma^{-1} (\sigma t)
  \,.
$$

This implies the following [[free functor|free property]]:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be an $L_\infty$-algebra. Morphisms of $dg$-algebras $W(\mathfrak{g}) \to A$ are in natural bijection to morphisms of [[graded vector space]]s $\mathfrak{g}^* \to A$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Forgetting the differential, $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is the free graded-commutative algebra generated by (a shifted copy of) $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$. Therefore,
$$
Hom_{dgca}(W(\mathfrak{g}),A)\subseteq Hom_{gca}(W(\mathfrak{g}),A)=Hom_{grVect}(\mathfrak{g}^*,A)\oplus Hom_{grVect}( \mathfrak{g}^*[1],A).
$$
Projecting down to $Hom_{grVect}(\mathfrak{g}^*,A)$, one obtains a natural map
$$
Hom_{dgca}(W(\mathfrak{g}),A)\to Hom_{grVect}(\mathfrak{g}^*,A),
$$
which is a bijection. 

To prove injectivity, we just have to show that the restriction of a dgca morphism $f:W(\mathfrak{g})\to A$ to $\mathfrak{g}^*$ determines the restriction of $f$ to $\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$. One has, for any $x=\sigma(t)\in \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x)&=f(\sigma(t))=f(d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}t-d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}t)\\
&=d_A f(t)- f(d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}t).
\end{aligned}
$$
Since $d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t)$ lies in the sub-gca of $W(\mathfrak{g})$ generated by $\mathfrak{g}^*$, the element $f(d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t))$, and therefore $f(x)$, is determined by $f\vert_{\mathfrak{g}^*}$. 

Next we show surjectivity, i.e. that every morphism of graded vector spaces $\phi:\mathfrak{g}^*\to A$ can be extended to a dgca morphism $f:W(\mathfrak{g})\to A$. Denote by $f_0: \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*\to A$ the extension of $\phi$ to a graded commutative algebra morphism, and let $\psi:\mathfrak{g}^*[1]\to A$ the graded vector space morphism defined by
$$
\psi(x)=d_A \phi(t)-f_0d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t),
$$
for any $x=\sigma(t)\in \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$.
The graded vector space morphism $\phi+\psi:\mathfrak{g}^*\oplus\mathfrak{g}^*[1]\to A$ extends to a commutative graded algebra $f:W(\mathfrak{g})\to A$, whose restriction to $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is $\phi$. We want to show that $f$ is actually a dgca morphism. We only need to test commutativity with the differentials on generators $t\in \mathfrak{g}^*$ and $x=\sigma(t)\in \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$. We have
$$
d_A f(t)=d_A\phi(t)=\psi(\sigma(t))+f_0d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t)=f(\sigma(t))+
f d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t)=f d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}(t),
$$
which in particular implies that $d_A f\vert_{\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*}=f d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}\vert_{\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*}$,
and
$$
d_A f(x)= d_A \psi(x) = -d_A f_0d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t)=-d_A f (d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t)).
$$
Since $d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t)\in \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$, we obtain
$$
d_A f(x)= -f d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} (d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})}(t))=
-f d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}(d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}(t)-x)=f d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}(x).
$$

**Example**

In particular for $A = \Omega^\bullet(X)$ the [[de Rham complex]] of a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, we have that 

$$
  Hom_{dgAlg}(W(\mathfrak{g}), \Omega^\bullet(X))
  = 
  \Omega^\bullet(X) \otimes \mathfrak{g}
$$

is the collection of [[differential form]]s with values in the $\infty$-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.

A morphism of 

$$
  (A, F_A) : W(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)
$$

sends the unshifted generators $t^a$ to differential forms $A^a$ and sends the shifted generators $\sigma t^a$ to their [[curvature]]. The respect for the differential on the shifted generators is the [[Bianchi identity]] on these curvatures.


## Relation to other concepts

### $\infty$-Lie algebra valued differential forms {#LieAlgValuedForms}

For $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[∞-Lie algebra]],  $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], $\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential forms are morphisms

$$
  (A,F_A) : W(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$

The image of the unshifted generators $A : \wedge^1 \mathfrak{g}^* \to \Omega^\bullet(X)$ are the forms themselves, the image of the shifted generators $F_A : \wedge^1 \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ are the corresponding [[curvature]]s. The respect for the differential on the shifted generators are the [[Bianchi identity]] on the curvatures.

Precisely if the curvatures vanish does the morphism factor through the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g}) \to CE(\mathfrak{g})$.

More on this at [[schreiber:curvature of ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]].


### Invariant polynomials and Chern-Simons elements

A [[cocycle]] in the [[∞-Lie algebra cohomology]] of the [[∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is a closed element in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$.

An [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle -\rangle$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ is a closed element in the Weil algebra $\langle -\rangle \in W(\mathfrak{g})$, subject to the addition condition that it its entirely in the shifted copy of $\mathfrak{g}$, $\langle - \rangle \in \wedge^\bullet (\mathfrak{g}^*[1])$.

Since the cohomology of $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is trivial, there is necessarily for each invariant polynomial an element $cs_{\langle -\rangle}$ such that

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} cs_{\langle -\rangle} = 
  \langle -\rangle
  \,.
$$

This is the [[Chern-Simons form|Chern-Simons element]] of the invariant polynomial. Its restriction 

$$
  \mu_{\langle -\rangle} := cs_{\langle - \rangle}|_{\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*}
$$

to the unshifted copy, hence to the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]], is the cocycle that is in transgression with $\langle - \rangle$.

For 

$$
  (A,F_A) : W(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)
$$

a collection of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential forms (as [above](LieAlgValuedForms)) and $\langle -\rangle  : CE(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}) \to W(\mathfrak{g})$ an [[invariant polynomial]], the composite

$$
  \langle F_A\rangle
  :
  CE(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})
  \stackrel{\langle - \rangle}{\to}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{(A,F_A)}{\to}
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
$$

is the corresponding [[curvature characteristic form]], a closed $n$-form on $X$. For $(\langle - \rangle, cs) : W(b^{n-1}) \to W(\mathfrak{g})$ the corresponding Chern-Simons element we have that $cs(A,F_A)$ is the corresponding [[Chern-Simons form]] on $X$.

## Examples

### Weil algebra of a Lie algebra {#WeilofLieAlg}

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite dimensional [[Lie algebra]]. This Lie algebra regarded as a [[Lie algebroid]] has as base manifold the point, $X_0 = pt$. Its algebra of functions is accordingly the ground field, and the algebra $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X_0)} \mathfrak{g}^*$ is just a [[Grassmann algebra]].

The [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) = (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d_{\mathfrak{g}})
  \,,
$$

where the differential acts on the elements of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree 1 by the linear dual of the Lie bracket.

$$
  d \mathfrak{g}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} = [-,-]^* : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^* \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*
  \,.
$$

The corresponding Weil algebra is obtained by adding another copy of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree 2

$$
  W(\mathfrak{g}) = (\wedge^\bullet (\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1]), d_{W(\mathfrak{g})})
$$

where with $\sigma : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ the degree shift isomorphism, the differential acts as

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*}
  : 
  [-,-]^* + \sigma
$$

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*[1]}
  : 
  \sigma \circ d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} \circ \sigma^{-1}
  \,.
$$

For illustration, we spell this out in a basis.

Let $\{t_a\}_a$ be a basis for the underlying vector space of $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ be the corresponding structure constants of the Lie bracket

$$
  [t_b, t_c] = C^a{}_{b c} t_a 
  \,.
$$

Then the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra is generated on generators $\{t^a\}$ of degree 1, on which the differential acts as

$$
  d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} : t^a \mapsto - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c
  \,.
$$

The Weil algebra in turn is generated from these generators $\{t^a\}$ in degree 1 and generators $\{r^a\}$ in degree 2, with differential given by

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} : t^a \mapsto - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c + r^a
$$

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} : r^a \mapsto C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge r^c 
  \,.
$$

### Weil algebra of a 0-truncated Lie algebroid

A 0-[[truncated]] Lie algebroid is just a [[smooth manifold]] $X$.
Its Weil algebra is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the
[[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T X$ of $X$, which is the [[de Rham algebra]]
$\Omega^\bullet(X)$ of $X$:

$$
  W(X) = CE(T X) = (\Omega^\bullet(X), d_{dR})
  \,.
$$
