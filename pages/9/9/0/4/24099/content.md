## Definition 

A [[locale]] $L$ is __locally positive__ (or _locally $(-1)$-connected_, _overt_, or _open_, but not to be confused with an [[open sublocale]]) if every [[open sublocale]] $O \in \mathcal{O}(L)$ is an indexed join of [[positive open sublocales]], or equivalently, if it has a base of positive open sublocales. 

Other definitions of a locally positive locale include that the unique map $!:L \to 1$ is [[open map|open]], and that the product projection $\pi_2:L \times L' \to L'$ is open for every locale $L'$.
