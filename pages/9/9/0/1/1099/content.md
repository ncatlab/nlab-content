#Idea#

An _$(\infty,1)$-functor_ is a morphism between [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].

#Definition#

The details of the definition depend on the model chosen for
[[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].

1. [[quasi-category]]

1. [[simplicially enriched category]]

1. [[Segal category]]

1. [[complete Segal space]]


#Definition in terms of quasi-categories#

For $C$ and $D$ [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]
the [[simplicial set]] of simplicial maps
$Hom_{SSet}(C,D)$ from $C$ to $D$ is itself a 
[[quasi-category]] (for that it is sufficient that $D$ is a quasi-category). Therefore

$$
  Fun(C,D) := Hom_{SSet}(C,D)
  \,.
$$
