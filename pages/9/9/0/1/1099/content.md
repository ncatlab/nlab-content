## Idea

An _$(\infty,1)$-functor_ is a morphism between [[(∞,1)-categories]].

The collection of all $(\infty,1)$-functors between two $(\infty,1)$-categories form an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]].

## Definition

The details of the definition depend on the model chosen for
[[(∞,1)-categories]].

1. [[quasi-category]]

1. [[simplicially enriched category]]

1. [[Segal category]]

1. [[complete Segal space]]


### In terms of quasi-categories

For $C$ and $D$ [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]
the [[simplicial set]] of simplicial maps
$Hom_{SSet}(C,D)$ from $C$ to $D$ is itself a 
[[quasi-category]] (for that it is sufficient that $D$ is a quasi-category). Therefore

$$
  Fun(C,D) := sSet(C,D)
  \,.
$$

These form the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]].
