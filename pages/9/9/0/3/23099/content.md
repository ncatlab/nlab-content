## Idea

What may be called *Borel-equivariant rational homotopy theory* (this is not an established term, but it fits well) is the [[rational homotopy theory]] of [[G-spaces]] regarded in [[Borel model structure|Borel equivariant homotopy theory]], hence where [[weak equivalences]] are simply the [[underlying]] ([[forgetful functor|forgetting]] the [[group action]]) [[weak homotopy equivalences]]. This is in contrast to the [[fixed locus]]-wise weak hom. equivalences, as in [[fine model structure on topological G-spaces|proper equivariant homotopy theory]], which leads to [[equivariant rational homotopy theory|proper equivariant rational homotopy theory]].

Borel-equivariant rational homotopy theory is relevant even and particularly to the study of plain (non-equivariant) [[homotopy types]], as it provides the means to conceptualize their [[rationalization]] 
beyond the constraint of these being [[nilpotent topological space|nilpotent]] or even [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]], hence outside the scope of plain [[rational homotopy theory]]:

Namely, given any [[connected topological space|connected]] space $X$ (but the same discussion applies to each [[connected component]] of a non-connected space), without any restriction on its [[fundamental group]], it fits into a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    \widehat X 
    &\xrightarrow{\;\;}&
    X
    \\
    && 
    \big\downarrow
    \\
    &&
    B \pi_1(X)    
  }
$$

with 

* its [[universal cover]] $\widehat X$, which *is* [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]; 

* the [[classifying space]] $B \pi_1(X)$ of its [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$.


Now, by the general discussion at *[[infinity-action|$\infty$-action]]* and at *[[Borel model structure]]* ([here](Borel+model+structure#RelationToSliceOverSimplicialClassifyingSpace)) -- this means that $X$ regarded in the [[slice (infinity,1)-category|slice]] over $B \pi$ is [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalent]] to the [[covering space]] $\widehat X$ *equipped* with its canonical [[group action]] by $\pi$.

This allows to regard the [[rationalization]] of non-[[nilpotent spaces]] $X$ as being the image of the [[universal covers]] $\widehat X$ in $\pi_1(X)$-eqjuivariant homotopy theory. (Since the $\pi_1(X)$-action on a universal covering space is [[free action|free]], this is necessarily Borel-equivariant.)

This perspective is really due to 
[Brown & Szczarba 95](#BrownSzczarba95) (based on [Brown & Szczarba 90](#BrownSzczarba90), [Brown & Szczarba 93](#BrownSzczarba93)) -- to spot it there, look ([here](#BrownSzczarba95Pages)) for: 2nd par. on  p. 883 (16 of 48) and around Thm. 4.4 on p. 896 (29 of 48).

Rational homotopy theory (as well as [[real homotopy theory]]) for general connected spaces $X$ and regarded as Borel-equivariant rational homotopy theory of their [[covering spaces]] is laid out, and the corresponding [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]] is proven, in:

(While [FHT 15](#FelixHalperinThomas15) does discuss, mostly in its Section 7, some aspects of non-simply connected spaces via the rational homotopy of their [[covering spaces]] with attention to $\pi_1$-actions, it does not seem to establish or mention aspects of a systematic generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]] to this situation.)
