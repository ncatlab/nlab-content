
## Disambiguation

In [[mathematics]], the term *Boolean semiring* or *Boolean rig* can refer to:

* [[Boolean semiring (Bartels)]], a rig satisfying $x^2 = x$
* [[Boolean semiring (Guzm√°n)]], a rig satisfying $x^2 = x$ and $1 + x + x = 1$
* One also has rigs satisfying $x^2 = x$ and $x + x = 0$, but those rigs are provably equivalent to [[Boolean rings]]. 

The term *Boolean semiring* can also refer to the following:

* [[Boolean semiring (Chajda & Kotrle)|Boolean semiring (Chajda &amp; Kotrle)]]
* [[Boolean semiring (Guterman)]]
* [[Boolean semiring (Subrahmanyam)]]
