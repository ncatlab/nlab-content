## Idea

A __row operation__ on a rectangular matrix with elements in a ring is operation of replacing it with another matrix of the same dimensions which is of one of the following types

* interchanging of two rows of the matrix

* rescaling one row by multiplying it with a nonzero element

* adding a multiple of one row to some other row.

Similarly, a __column operation__ is either interchanging two columns, rescaling one column by multiplying it with a nonzero element or adding a multiple of one column to some other column.

## Properties

Each row operation can be achieved by multiplying the matrix from the left by an [[elementary matrix]].

If the ring is a field then each row operation is invertible.
