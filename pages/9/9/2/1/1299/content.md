Given a [[filter]] $F$ of [[ideal]]s in a ring $R$, a left $R$-[[module]] $M$ is __$F$-torsion__ ([[Pierre Gabriel|Gabriel]]'s terminology: $F$-negligible) if for any $m\in M$ there exists a $L$ in $F$ which annihilates it: $L m=0$. 

Given two filters $F,G$ of left ideals on $R$, one defines their __Gabriel composition__ (or __Gabriel product__) $F\bullet G$ as the set of all left ideals $L$ in $R$ such that there is $K$ in $G$ with $K/L$ being $F$-torsion. Then $F\bullet G$ is again a filter of left ideals in $R$.

Gabriel composition of filters corresponds to the [[Gabriel multiplication]] of the corresponding torsion classes considered as strictly full subcategories. A Gabriel composition of [[uniform filter]]s is uniform.
