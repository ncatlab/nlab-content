## Definition

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a [[von Neumann algebra]] acting on a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.

A vector $x \in \mathcal{H}$ is a **separating vector** if $M(x) = 0$ implies $M = 0$ for all $M \in \mathcal{M}$.


## Properties

The notions of separating vector is dual to that of [[cyclic vector]] with respect to the [[commutant]] $\mathcal{M}'$, that is a vector is cyclic for $\mathcal{M}$ iff it is separating for $\mathcal{M}'$.

## Applications

In the context of [[AQFT]] separating vectors appear as _vacuum [[state]]s_ . See [[Reeh-Schlieder theorem]].
