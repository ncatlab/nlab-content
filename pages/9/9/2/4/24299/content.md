## Definition ##

In [[dependent type theory]], given a [[Russell universe]] $U$, a [[type]] $A$ is **purely essentially $U$-small** if the universe has an element $B:U$ and an equivalence $p:A \simeq B$. 

A [[type]] $A$ is **merely essentially $U$-small** if [[existential quantifier|there merely exists]] an element $B:U$ such that $A \simeq B$: 
$$\mathrm{isEssentiallySmall}_U(A) \coloneqq \exists B:U.A \simeq B$$

Similarly, given a [[Tarski universe]] $(U, T)$, a [[type]] $A$ is **purely essentially $U$-small** if the universe has an element $B:U$ and an equivalence $p:A \simeq T(B)$.

A [[type]] $A$ is **merely essentially $U$-small** if [[existential quantifier|there merely exists]] an element $B:U$ such that $A \simeq T(B)$: 
$$\mathrm{isEssentiallySmall}_U(A) \coloneqq \exists B:U.A \simeq T(B)$$

## Examples

For a single universe $U$, [[propositional resizing]] states that the type of all [[h-propositions]] in a universe is essentially $U$-small. 

## Making all essentially small types small

Given a [[Russell universe]] $U$, one could make all essentially $U$-small types actually small types by the following [[inference rules]]:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash \mathrm{witnSmall}_A:\exists B:U.A \simeq B}{\Gamma \vdash A:U}$$
