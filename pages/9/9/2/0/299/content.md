A _0-category_ is a [[set]]. This terminology may seem strange at first, but it is very helpful to see sets as the beginning of a sequence of concepts: sets, [[category|categories]], [[2-category|2-categories]], [[3-category|3-categories]], etc. Doing so reveals patterns such as the [[periodic table]]. (It also sheds light on the theory of [[homotopy group]]s and [[n-stuff]].)

For example, there should be a $1$-category of $0$-categories; this is the [[Set|category of sets]]. Then a [[enriched category|category enriched]] over this is a $1$-category (more precisely, a [[locally small category]]). Furthermore, an enriched groupoid is a [[groupoid]] (or $1$-groupoid), so a $0$-category is the same as a [[0-groupoid]].

To some extent, one can continue to define a [[(-1)-category]] to be a [[truth value]] and a [[(-2)-category]] to be a triviality (that is, there is exactly one). These don\'t fit the pattern perfectly; but the concepts of [[(-1)-groupoid]] and [[(-2)-groupoid]] for them do work perfectly, as does the concept of [[0-poset]] for a truth value.
