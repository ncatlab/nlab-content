A _0-category_ is a set. This terminology may seem strange at first, but it is very helpful to see sets as the beginning of a sequence of concepts: sets, categories, 2-categories, 3-categories, etc.  Doing so reveals patterns such as the [[periodic table]].

To some extent, one can continue to define a [[(-1)-category]] to be a [[truth value]] and a [[(-2)-category]] to be a triviality (that is, there is exactly one). These don\'t fit the pattern perfectly; but the concepts of [[(-1)-groupoid]] and [[(-2)-groupoid]] for them do work perfectly, as does the concept of [[0-poset]] for a truth value.
