## Idea

The [[philosophy|philosophical]] system laid out by [[Baruch Spinoza]].

## Relation to Hegel's system

[[Georg Hegel]] in his _[[Science of Logic]]_ claims to describe a system which subsumes Spinoza's, but which refines it by extending it to more fundamental stages. What is called _Hegel's system_ proceeds from (what he calls) stages of determinations of _[[being]]_ to stages of determinations of the _essence_ to culminate in _substance_, "the final unity of essence and being" ([WdL &#167;1235](Science+of+Logic#1235)), which Hegel claims ([WdL &#167;1287](Science+of+Logic#1287)) to be the _substance_ of Spinoza's system.
