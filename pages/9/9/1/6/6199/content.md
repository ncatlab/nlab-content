## Idea

A __dynamical system__ is a [[space]] $X$ (often a bare [[set]] or a [[manifold]]) together with a "law of motion" expressed by the [[action]] of a [[monoid]] $A$:

$$
  A \times X \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

To model continuous [[time]]-evolution one may take $A = (\mathbb{R}, +)$ to be the additive [[group]] of [[real numbers]]. 

For discrete time evolution $A = (\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is the additive group of [[integers]] (or just the monoid $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ of [[natural numbers]]). In this case the law of motion is often given by an [[initial value problem]] for a [[differential equation]] "of evolution type".

In this case, the dynamical system is equivalently a space $X$ equipped with an [[automorphism]] (this being the action of the [[unit element]] in $\mathbb{Z}$, sometimes called the "shift").
  

Sometimes the evolution is only partially defined; this is most often in dynamical systems induced by evolution differential equations which do not necessarily have existence of solutions for arbitrary large time, or the dynamical system is defined only for nonnegative time. 

The definition evidently makes sense quite generally [[internalization|internal to]] various ambient [[categories]]: For instance one considers complex dynamics, [[algebraic dynamics]], arithmetic dynamics and so on. 

Dynamical systems are used to describe not only physical motions but also the behaviour of parameters of various systems, e.g. in sociological, financial, weather and other models.
