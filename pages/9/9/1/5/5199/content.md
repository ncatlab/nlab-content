## Idea

A **framed link** is a [[link]] where the [[circles]] forming the components are viewed as having a thickness, albeit an arbitrarily small thickness.
That is to say, instead of the components of the links being [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embedded]] circles, they are embedded solid [[tori]].

The thickening can be considered in one direction only which gives [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embedded]] [[ribbons]].  This is an equivalent definition which can be useful as it makes the distinction clearer between an embedding and the same embedding composed with, say, a [[Dehn twist]].

A [[link diagram]] can be made into a diagram of a framed links by giving it the **blackboard framing**: this views each segment of the link diagram as a ribbon lying on the "blackboard".

Two diagrams represent the same link diagram if and only if they can be related by a modified version of the [[Reidemeister moves]] in which the first move is replaced by the following move.

## Definition 

The precise notion of a framing on a link is perhaps most naturally given in terms of [[smooth manifold|smooth structures]] on [[manifolds]]. We'll start from there and later give other versions. 

### Framing

Let $M$ be an [[orientation|oriented]] [[3-manifold]], for example $S^3$. The [[tangent bundle]] $p: T M \to M$ is a bundle with [[structure group]] [[general linear group|$GL(3) = GL(\mathbb{R}^3)$]] which in fact admits a [[reduction of the structure group|reduction]] to $GL_+(3)$ (invertible [[linear transformations]] with [[positive number|positive]] [[determinant]]) since $M$ is oriented. A further reduction to the structure group [[SO(3)|$SO(3)$]] can be effected by a number of means, e.g., by equipping $M$ with a [[Riemannian metric]]. 

Now let 

$$L: S^1 \sqcup \ldots \sqcup S^1 \hookrightarrow M$$ 

be a smoothly embedded link (of oriented circles). The [[normal bundle]] of $L$ is the [[cokernel]] of the bundle inclusion 

$$T(S^1 \sqcup \ldots \sqcup S^1) \to L^\ast T M$$ 

(as bundles over $S^1 \sqcup \ldots \sqcup S^1$); it is naturally [[associated bundle|associated]] with a [[principal bundle|principal]] $SO(2)$-bundle. A *framing* of $L$ is simply a choice of [[section]] $\sigma$ of this principal $SO(2)$-bundle. It can be thought of as a smooth choice of unit normal vectors along points of the embedded link, and can be visualized as "ribbons", one for each component $S^1$, with one edge of the ribbon being that component. 

The $SO(2)$-bundle or circle bundle over each component $S^1$ can be seen as an embedded [[torus]] in $M$. The framing itself induces a diffeomorphism on this torus which takes an element $(\xi, p)$ over $p \in S^1$ to $(\sigma(p)\xi, p)$. 

### Framing number

However, it is often convenient to consider such framings, or rather their associated torus [[diffeomorphisms]], only up to [[isotopy]]. For each component $S^1$, the [[isotopy class]] is specified by an [[integer]] which gives the number of 360 degree clockwise rotations of the unit normal or clockwise twists of the ribbon as one traverses the component in the direction of its orientation. This is called the *framing number*.

If one regards the framed link as a ribbon link, then its framing number is the [[linking number]] of the two [[boundary of a manifold|boundaries]] of the [[ribbon]].

Thus an alternative way of describing a framing on an oriented link is by assigning an integer (framing number) to each link component.

## Examples
