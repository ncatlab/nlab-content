## Idea

### Heat kernel as a fundamental solution

One of the simplest linear partial differential equations of parabolic type is the heat (conductivity) equation. Recall that a [[fundamental solution]] of a linear partial differential operator $P$ is a solution of the PDE $P f = \delta$ where the inhomogeneous term $\delta$ is a [[delta function]] (in appropriate boundary conditions).

The fundamental solution of a heat equation is called the **heat kernel**. 

### Role in index theory

The study of heat kernel led to a new simpler proof of the [[index theorem]] by [[Michael Atiyah|Atiyah]], [[Raoul Bott|Bott]] and Patodi.

### Heat kernel for operators over Riemannian manifolds

Let $E\to X$ be a smooth vector bundle over a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$, $\Gamma(E)$ the space of the smooth sections of $E$ and $P:\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E)$ a positive self-adjoint elliptic differential operator. The **heat operator** symbolically denoted by $e^{-tP}:\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E)$ is an infinitely smoothening operator characterized by the property that 

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (e^{-tP}u) = -Pe^{-tP}u
$$

for all $u\in\Gamma(E)$. The **heat kernel** $K$ for $P$ is then the kernel of an [[integral operator]] representing the heat operator:

$$
(e^{-tP}u)(x) = \int_X K_t(x,y) u(y) dy
$$ 

$K_t(x,y):E_y\to E_x$ is a linear map for all $x,y$ and $t$. Of course, one needs to justify this definition by the proof of the existence. 

### Heat kernel and path integrals

The [[Schr√∂dinger equation]] without potential term is similar to the 
[[heat equation]] (there is an additional $\sqrt{-1}$); hence its fundamental solution is similar. The heat equation on the other hand can describe [[diffusion]]. Therefore also the similarity in the [[path integral]] description: the [[Wiener measure]] [[integral]] describes diffusion using [[Brownian motion]], similarly the Feynman path integral (for a finite-dimensional system) describes [[quantum mechanics]]; many points in the standard calculations are parallel.
