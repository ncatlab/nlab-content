One of the simplest linear partial differential equations of parabolic type is the heat (conductivity) equation. Recall that a [[fundamental solution]] of a linear partial differential operator $P$ is a solution of the PDE $P f = \delta$ where the inhomogeneous term $\delta$ is a [[delta function]] (in appropriate boundary conditions).

The fundamental solution of a heat equation is called the **heat kernel**. The study of heat kernel led to a new simpler proof of the [[index theorem]] by [[Michael Atiyah|Atiyah]], [[Raoul Bott|Bott]] and Patodi.

The [[Schroedinger equation]] without potential term is similar to the heat equation (there is an additional $\sqrt{-1}$); hence its fundamental solution is similar. The heat equation on the other hand can describe diffusion. Therefore also the similarity in the [[path integral]] description: the Wiener integral describes diffusion using Brownian motion, similarly the Feynman path integral (for a finite-dimensional system) describes quantum mechanics; many points in the standard calculations are parallel.
