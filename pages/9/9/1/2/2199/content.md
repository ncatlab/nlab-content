A __boolean domain__ $\mathbb{B}$ is a generic 2-element set, say, $\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}$, whose elements are intended for interpretation as logical values, commonly but not invariably, with $0 = \mathrm{false}$ and $1 = \mathrm{true}$.

Note that $\mathbb{B}$ is the same as the set of [[truth values]] in [[classical logic]].  If we think of $\mathbb{B}$ as a [[pointed set]] equipped with the element that is interpreted as $true$ (so that the other element must be interpreted as $false$), then there is an [[generalized the|effectively unique]] boolean domain.

The way I'll be doing things, there is actually an important distinction between the mathematical object $\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}$ and the set of logical values $\{ \mathrm{false}, \mathrm{true} \}$.  There is a step of interpretation --- or "applying the mathematics to the logical subject matter" --- that separates them.  There is of course the usual interpretation, so we often get sloppy about when we cross the line, but there are good reasons for observing it at other times.

A __boolean variable__ $x$ is a variable that takes its value from a boolean domain, as $x \in \mathbb{B}$.  If this variable depends on parameters, then it is (or defines) a [[Boolean-valued function]], that is a [[function]] whose target if $\mathbb{B}$.
