[[!redirects FinVect]]

**Vect** is the [[category]] whose [[object|objects]] are [[vector space|vector spaces]] and whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are linear operators.  This definition implicitly presumes that we are considering vector spaces over a fixed field $k$.  To make the dependence on the field explicit, we may write $Vect_k$.  

Vect is where linear algebra lives.

The [[full subcategory]] of Vect consisting of finite-dimensional vector spaces is denoted **FinVect**.
