_Vect_ is the [[category]] whose [[object|objects]] are vector spaces and whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are linear operators.  This definition implicitly presumes that we are considering vector spaces over a fixed field $k$.  To make the dependence on the field explicit, we may write $Vect_k$.  

Vect is where linear algebra lives.
