## Idea

In [[type theory]], a _dependent type_ or _[[type]] in [[context]]_ is a *[[family]]* or *[[bundle]]* of [[types]] which vary over the elements ([[terms]]) of some other type.  It can be regarded as a formalization of the notion of "indexed family," providing a [[structural set theory|structural]] account of families (in contrast to the [[material set theory|material]] approach which requires sets to be able to contain other sets as elements).

Type theory with the notion of dependent types is called _[[dependent type theory]]_.

In the [categorical semantics of type theory](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+theory#CategoricalSemantics), a dependent type 

$$
  x:A \; \vdash \;B(x) \;\mathrm{type}
$$ 

is represented by a particular [[morphism]] $p\colon B\to A$, the intended meaning being that each type $B(x)$ is the [[fiber]] of $p$ over $x\in A$.  The morphism in a category that may represent dependent types in this way are sometimes called [[display morphisms]] (especially when not every morphism is a display morphism).

Dependent types can be thought of as fibrations in classical homotopy theory. The base space is $X$, the total space is $\sum_{(x:X)}P(x)$ and the fiber $P(\star_X)$. This gives the fibration:

$$P(\star_X)\to \sum_{x:X}P(x) \to X$$

## Examples

When the [[theory]] of a [[category]] is phrased in dependent type theory then there is one type "$obj$" of [[objects]] and a type $hom$ of [[morphisms]], which is dependent on two terms of type $obj$, so that for any $x,y:obj$ there is a type $hom(x,y)$ of arrows from $x$ to $y$.  This dependency is usually written as $x,y:obj \vdash hom(x,y):Type$.  In some theories, it makes sense to say that the type of "$hom$" itself is $obj, obj\to Type$ (usually understood as $obj \to (obj \to Type)$ or $(\obj \times \obj) \to Type$), i.e. a function from pairs of elements of $A$ to the [[type of types|universe]] $Type$ of types.
