I am still working on a text Nonabelian algebraic topology, with a draft currently being reviewed. It focuses on the use of crossed complexes and related cubical structures. 

A major set of work was with Philip Higgins; we defined a homotopy double groupoid of a pointed pair of spaces in 1974, published in 1978, and generalised this to the cubical homotopy omega-groupoid of filtered space in 1977, published in 1981. 

The use of strict cubical multiple groupoids has been fundamental to this work, because of the ability of cubical methods to model easily algebraic inverse to subdivision. This was essential for the main aims of this work with Higgins: higher homotopy van Kampen theorems. Cubical methods are also useful for discussion of tensor products. 

Work with Jean-Louis Loday gave a van Kampen theorem for cat^n-groups, structures which model homotopy (n+1)-types. This enables new calculations of nonabelian homotopy invariants, such as n-adic homotopy groups. 

I am also interested in the methodology of mathematics, and have articles on this on my Popularisation and teaching page &lt;http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/publar.html>.
