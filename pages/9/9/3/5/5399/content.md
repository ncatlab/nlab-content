## Definition

A [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] is called **clopen** if it is both [[open set|open]] and [[closed set|closed]].  Equivalently, a clopen set is a [[complement|complemented element]] of the [[frame]] of open subsets, a definition which makes as good sense for [[locales]] as for spaces.


## Properties

The set of clopen sets in any space forms a [[Boolean algebra]].  If the space is a [[Stone space]], then it can be reconstructed from its Boolean algebra of clopens.  On the other hand, a space is [[connected space|connected]] just when the only clopens are the [[empty set]] and the whole space.
