## Writing

### Ultrafinitism

Nelson argued for a position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as [[ultrafinitism]]:

### Nelson arithmetic

In the same paper he defined a first order theory that was weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]], which replaces the induction schema of induction on natural numbers with a predicate and two axioms that state that induction on natural numbers for that predicate is true:

He did not give a name to the theory, so it has been called "[[Nelson arithmetic]]" for lack of a better name. 

### (In)Consistency of Peano Arithmetic

At one point Nelson claimed to have a [[formal proof]] of [[inconsistency]] of [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA). While the proof turned out to be wrong, as acknowledged by Nelson, given that the supicion that PA might be inconsistent after all is shared by others (e.g. [[Vladimir Voevodsky]]) it is still interesting to see Nelson's proof strategy via [[Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]]:
