## Selected writings

### Ultrafinitism

Nelson argued for a position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as [[ultrafinitism]]:

* {#Nelson11} [[Edward Nelson]], _Warning Signs of a Possible Collapse of Contemporary Mathematics_ (~2011) &lbrack;[pdf](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/papers/warn.pdf), [[Nelson-WarningSigns.pdf:file]]&rbrack;

### Nelson arithmetic

[Nelson 2011](#Nelson11) also defined a [[first-order theory]] that was weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]], which replaces the [[induction]] schema of induction on [[natural numbers]] with a predicate and two axioms that state that induction on natural numbers for that predicate is true.

He did not give a name to the theory, so it has been called "[[Nelson arithmetic]]" for lack of a better name. 

### (In)Consistency of Peano Arithmetic

At one point Nelson claimed to have a [[formal proof]] of [[inconsistency]] of [[Peano arithmetic]] (PA). While the proof was ultimately acknowledged by Nelson to be wrong, given that the suspicion that PA might be inconsistent after all is shared by others (e.g. [[Vladimir Voevodsky]]), it is still interesting to see Nelson's proof strategy via [[Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]]:

## Quotes
 {#Quotes}

{#FirstQuantizationIsAMystery} Famously attributed to Edward Nelson is the phrase:

> *First quantization is a mystery, but second quantization is a functor.*

(on "first" or "[[canonical quantization]]" versus "[[second quantization]]" of [[free field theory|free fields]]) maybe first quoted as such in:

* [[Michael Reed]], [[Barry Simon]]; p. 207 of Vol 2 of: *[[Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics]]*, Academic Press (1978) &lbrack;[pdf](http://www.astrosen.unam.mx/~aceves/Metodos/ebooks/reed_simon2.pdf)&rbrack;
