A _closed monoidal deformation retract_ on a [[closed category|closed]] [[monoidal category|(symmetric) monoidal]] [[homotopical category|homotopical]] category $(V, \otimes, [-,-])$ is a [[deformation retract]] for the [[two-variable adjunction]]

$$
  (\otimes , [-,-], [-,-]) : V \times V \to V
$$

such that a bunch of conditions are satisfied:

#Remarks#

Such closed monoidal deformation retracts are used to characterize [[closed monoidal homotopical category|closed monoidal homotopical categories]].
