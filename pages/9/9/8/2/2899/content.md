This entry is about &#233;tale morphisms in the sense of [[algebraic geometry]]. The word [[etale map|étale map]] is preffered in differentiable and topological contexts, see [[étalé space]] for the topological version. 

Recall that for a [[smooth morphism of schemes]] $f:X\to Y$ we can define a relative dimension in every point $X$. 
A morphism of [[schemes]] is **&#233;tale** if it is a smooth morphism and if it is of relative dimension $0$. Equivalently, it is [[flat morphism|flat]] and unramified. 
The property of being &#233;tale is [[base change|preserved under pullbacks]] along any morphism of schemes; a [[composite]] of &#233;tale maps is &#233;tale.

There is a weaker notion of a formally &#233;tale morphism. A morphism is **formally &#233;tale** if it is [[formally smooth]] (satisfying an infinitesimal lifting property) and formally unramified. These are sheaf-like properties, what can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and [[epipresheaf]] properties on the $Q$-category of nilpotent thickenings). 

&#201;tale morphisms are used to define small and big [[etale site|étale sites]] and [[étale cohomology]]. &#201;tale topology has similar cohomological properties to complex [[analytic topology]], and in particular it is much finer for cohomological purposes than the [[Zariski topology]].
