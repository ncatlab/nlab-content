# Idea #

Given an [[algebraic theory]] $\mathcal{V}$, a $\mathcal{V}$-algebra is a model of $\mathcal{V}$ in the category $Set$.  A 'Tall-Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid' is _the kind of thing that acts on $\mathcal{V}$-algebras_.  

# Definition #

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be an [[algebraic theory]] and let $\mathcal{V}-alg$ be the category of models of this theory in $Set$.  Then a **Tall-Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid** is a [[monoid|monoid object]] in the category of co-$\mathcal{V}$-objects in $\mathcal{V}-alg$.   

# Examples #

* If $\mathcal{V}$ is the theory of commutative, unital rings, a $\mathcal{V}$-algebra is a commutative, unital ring, and the corresponding sort of Tall-Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid is called a [[biring]].  

* If $\mathcal{V}$ is the theory of commutative, associative algebras over a field $k$, then a $\mathcal{V}$-algebra is a commutative, associative algebra over $k$, and the corresponding sort of Tall-Wraith $\mathcal{V}$-monoid is called a [[plethory]].

[[John Baez]]: The above material is tentative, based on things I heard [on the $n$-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/the_monads_hurt_my_head_but_no.html#c025550), but may not have understood. 

[[Andrew Stacey]]: looks okay to me.  I put in lots of "commutative"s in the examples because the original papers in both cases dealt with commutative cases and I thought it best that the examples were as close as possible to the originals.  I also changed the $V$ to $\mathcal{V}$ in line with the notation from _The Hunting of the Hopf Ring_.  Should there be a lab standard on fonts for categories, objects, functors, and the like?
