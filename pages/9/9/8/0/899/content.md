#Idea
A **topological group** is an [[internalization|internal]] [[group object]] in the category of [[topological space|topological spaces]].

More explicitly, it is a group equipped with a topology such that the multiplication and inversion maps are continuous.

#unitary representation on Hilbert spaces

* definition: an unitary representation $R$ of a topological group $G$ in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is a continuous homomorphism
$$
   R: G \to \mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})
$$
where $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{H})$ is the group of [[unitary operator]]s on $\mathcal{H}$ with respect to the strong topology.
