## Idea

For $C$ a [[locally small category]], every [[object]] $X$ of $C$ induces a [[presheaf]] on $C$: the [[representable presheaf]] $h_X$ represented by $X$. This assignment extends to a [[functor]] $C \to [C^{op}, Set]$ from $C$ to its [[category of presheaves]].
The [[Yoneda lemma]] implies that this functor is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] and hence realizes $C$ as a [[full subcategory]] inside its category of presheaves.

Recall from the discussion at [[representable presheaf]] that the presheaf represented by an object $X$ of $C$ is the functor $h_X :C^{op} \to Set$ whose assignment is illustrated by

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/ericforgy/files/hxalpha3.jpg" width = "400"/>

which sends each object $U$ to $Hom_C(U,X)$ and each morphism $\alpha:U'\to U$ to the function

$$h_X\alpha: Hom_C(U,X)\to Hom_C(U',X).$$

Moreover, for $f : X \to Y$ a [[morphism]] in $C$, this induces a [[natural transformation]] $h_f : h_X \to h_Y$, whose component on $U$ in $X$ is illustrated by

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/ericforgy/files/hf.jpg" width = "400"/>

For this to be a natural transformation, we need to have the commuting diagram

$$\array{
h_X U & \stackrel{h_f U}{\rightarrow} & h_Y U \\
\mathllap{h_X\alpha\quad}{\downarrow} & {} & \mathrlap{\downarrow}{\quad h_Y\alpha} \\
h_X U' & \stackrel{h_f U'}{\rightarrow} & h_Y U'
}$$

but this simply means that it doesn't matter if we first "comb" the strands back to $U'$ and then comb the strands forward to $Y$, or comb the strands forward to $Y$ first and then comb the strands back to $U'$


<img src="http://ncatlab.org/ericforgy/files/nattrans.jpg" width = "600"/>

which follows from associativity of composition of morphisms in $C$.




 

## Definition

The **Yoneda embedding** for $C$ a [[locally small category]] is the [[functor]]

$$
  Y : C \to [C^{op}, Set]
$$

from $C$ to the [[category of presheaves]] over $C$
which is the image of the [[hom-functor]]

$$
  Hom : C^{op} \times C \to Set
$$

under the Hom [[adjunction]]

$$
  Hom(C^{op} \times C , Set) \simeq
  Hom(C, [C^{op}, Set])
$$

in the [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[monoidal category|symmetric monoidal category]] [[Cat]].

Hence $Y$ sends any [[object]] $c \in C$ to the [[representable presheaf]] which assigns to any other object $d$ of $C$ the [[hom-set]] of [[morphism]]s from $d$ into $c$:

$$
  Y(c) 
    \;\colon\; 
  C^{op} \stackrel{C(-,c)}{\to} Set
  \,.
$$

The Yoneda embedding is sometimes denoted by &#x3088;, the [hiragana kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(kana%29) for "Yo"; see the references [below](#ReferencesNotation).


## Remarks

We can also curry the Hom functor in the other variable, thus obtaining a contravariant functor
$$
C^{op} \to [C, Set]
$$
which is explicitly given by $c \mapsto C(c,-)$. This is sometimes jokingly called the **contravariant Yoneda embedding**. 

However, since $C^{op}(-,c)=C(c,-)$, it is easy to see that the contravariant Yoneda embedding is just the Yoneda embedding $Y: C^{\op} \to [(C^{op})^{op}, Set]=[C, Set]$ of $C^{op}$, and hence does not require special treatment.  

## Properties

###### Proposition
**(Yoneda embedding is a [[fully faithful functor]])**

For $\mathcal{C}$ any [[category]], the [[functor]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{C}
      &\overset{Y}{\hookrightarrow}&
    [\mathcal{C}^{op}, Set]
    \\
    c &\mapsto& Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-,c)
  }
$$

is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that for $c_1, c_2 \in \mathcal{C}$ any two [[objects]], we have that every [[morphism]] of [[presheaves]] between their [[representable functor|represented presheaves]] 

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-,c_1)
   \overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-,c_2)
$$

is of the form 

$$
  \phi \;=\; Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-,f)
$$

for a unique morphism 

$$
  f \;\colon\; c_1 \to c_2
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$. This follows by the [[Yoneda lemma]], which says that morphisms $\phi$ as above are identified with the elements in 

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(-,c_2)(c_1)
  \;=\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(c_1,c_2)
  \,.
$$

It is also [[limit]] preserving (= [[continuous functor]]), but does in general not preserve [[colimit]]s. 

The Yoneda embedding of a [[small category]] $S$ into the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on $S$ gives a [[free cocompletion]] of $S$.

If the Yoneda embedding of a category has a [[left adjoint]], then that category is called a _[[total category]]_ .
