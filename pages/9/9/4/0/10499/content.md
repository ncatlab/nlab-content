## Idea

The classical _fracture theorem_ is a fundamental result in [[homotopy theory]] which says that the study of [[homotopy types]] may be decomposed into that of [[rational homotopy types]] and [[p-complete homotopy types]] of [[p-local homotopy types]].

More precisely, for $p$ a [[prime number]] and $X$ a [[p-local homotopy type]], then $X$ is the [[homotopy fiber product]]

$$
  X \simeq X_{\mathbb{Q}} \underset{(X_p^\wedge)_{\mathbb{Q}}}{\times} X_p^\wedge
$$

of its [[rationalization]] with its [[p-completion]].

(e.g [May-Ponto, theorem 13.1.4](#MayPonto))

## Examples

In an [[tangent cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]] every [[stable homotopy type]] is canonically a cohesive/differential extension of its [[geometric realization of a cohesive homotopy type|geometric realization]] by way of a fracture theorem involving the localizations induced by the [[shape modality]] and the [[flat modality]]. See at _[tangent cohesion -- Cohesive and differential refinement](tangent+cohesive+%28?%2C1%29-topos#CohesiveAndDifferentialRefinement)_.
