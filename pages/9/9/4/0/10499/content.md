## Examples

In an [[tangent cohesive (âˆž,1)-topos]] every [[stable homotopy type]] is canonically a cohesive/differential extension of its [[geometric realization of a cohesive homotopy type|geometric realization]] by way of a fracture theorem involving the localizations induced by the [[shape modality]] and the [[flat modality]]. See at _[tangent cohesion -- Cohesive and differential refinement](tangent+cohesive+%28?%2C1%29-topos#CohesiveAndDifferentialRefinement)_.
