_GAGA_ refers to the paper *G&#233;ometrie Alg&#233;brique et G&#233;om&#233;trie Analytique* by [[Serre]], and in general to results relating [[complex geometry|complex]] [[algebraic geometry]] and [[complex geometry|complex]] [[analytic geometry]]. 

For example, often one can computes [[sheaf cohomology]] either in the algebraic category or in the analytic category, obtaining the same result. This can be useful because one has more tools in the analytic category, such as [[Dolbeault cohomology|Dolbeault resolutions]]. Typically GAGA-type theorems hold for proper (compact) varieties, but not for non-proper varieties.
