

This page collects the various networks and communities, in the largest possible sense, of mathematicians and non-mathematicians whose research is [[category theory]]-oriented.

It is by no means a comprehensive list, in strict alphabetic order.

1. [CoACT](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/centre-of-australian-category-theory-coact), the centre of Australian Category Theory (!!! This link is probably outdated)
2. [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io), the network of Italian category theorists. See the updated [event page](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest.html)!
3. [TallCats](https://compose.ioc.ee), the Compositional Systems and Methods group at TalTech University, Tallinn, Estonia.
4. The [Topos institute](https://topos.institute), an "independent scientific institute devoted to fundamental inquiry that shapes the technologies of tomorrow".
5. Yorkshire and Midlands Category Theory Seminar, [YaMCATS](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/extranet/staff-material/staff-profiles/simona-paoli/yorkshire-and-midlands-category-theory-seminar-yamcats), is a category theory research network between the universities of Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield. The network is partially funded by the London Mathematical Society.
6. The [Applied Category Theory (ACT)](https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/) community.
