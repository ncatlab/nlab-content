

This page collects the various networks and communities, in the largest possible sense, of mathematicians and non-mathematicians whose research is [[category theory]]-oriented.

It is by no means a comprehensive list, in strict alphabetic order.

* [Applied Category Theory (ACT)](https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/) -- On [[applied category theory]].

* [CoACT](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/innovative-technologies/centres/centre-of-australian-category-theory-coact) -- the Centre of Australian Category Theory at Macquarie University.

* [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io) -- a network of Italian category theorists. See the [event page](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest21.html) for the current edition and for [last year](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest20.html)'s edition!


* [[Math-Phys-Cat]] ([home page](https://math-phys.group)) -- _Mathematical-Physics and Categorification Group_, a Brazilian research group on [[mathematical physics]] with emphasis on [[higher category theory and physics]].


* [TallCats](https://compose.ioc.ee) -- the Compositional Systems and Methods group at TalTech University, Tallinn, Estonia.

* [Topos institute](https://topos.institute) -- an "independent scientific institute devoted to fundamental inquiry that shapes the technologies of tomorrow".


* [YaMCATS](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/extranet/staff-material/staff-profiles/simona-paoli/yorkshire-and-midlands-category-theory-seminar-yamcats) -- the Yorkshire and Midlands Category Theory Seminar,  is a category theory research network between the universities of Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield. The network is partially funded by the London Mathematical Society.
