on [[formal logic]] (for which [[George Boole|Boole]] became widely famous, cf. *[[Boolean algebra]]*) but also on [[probability theory]], where  (as observed by [Pitowsky 1989a](Bell's+inequalities#Pitowsky89a), reviewed, e.g., in [Khrennikov 2008](Bell's+inequalities#Khrennikov08)) Boole's book derives the inequalities that later became known as *[[Bell's inequalities]]* in [[quantum probability theory]].
