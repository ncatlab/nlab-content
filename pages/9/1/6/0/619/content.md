A full [[subcategory]] is **reflective** if its inclusion functor has a [[adjunction|left adjoint]].  The left adjoint is sometimes called the _reflector_.

A reflective subcategory is always closed under [[limit|limits]], and inherits [[colimit|colimits]] from the larger category by application of the reflector.
