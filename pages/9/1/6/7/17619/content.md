## Idea

The idea of cyclic homology can be generalized to other [[skew-simplicial group]]s as shown by Krasauskas and independently by Fiodorowicz. The simplest analogue is the dihedral homology.

There is also a geometric analogy where 

* _[[Hochschild homology]]_ is essentially the cohomology of [[free loop spaces]];

*  _[[cyclic homology]]_ is essentially the cohomology of [[free loop spaces]] modulo the [[circle group]] $SO(2)$ action by rotating on the loops;

so _dihedral homology_ is the cohomology of free loop spaces modulo the $O(2)$-action on loops (including reflections, as in the [[dihedral group]]).
