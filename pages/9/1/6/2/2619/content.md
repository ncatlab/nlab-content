Let $E$ be a small, cocomplete category. An object $e$ of $E$ is **tiny** if the hom-functor $E(e, -) : E \to Set$ preserves small colimits.

Tiny objects are also sometimes called **small-[[projective object]]s**.

If homming out of a tiny object even has a [[right adjoint]] and hence preserves _all_ colimits it is called an [[infinitesimal object|atomic object]]. The right adjoint is called an [[amazing right adjoint]].
