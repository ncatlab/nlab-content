## Idea

The notion of _initial Θ-theta data_ was introduced by [[Shinichi Mochizuki]] in §3 of [Inter-Universal Teichmüller theory I](#MochizukiIUTTI) as the starting point for the notion of a [[chain of Θ-Hodge theatres]].

## Notation

In order to understand the definition, we recall a little notation. 

1) Given a field $F$, the notation $E / F$ means that $E$ is a [[field extension]] of $F$. 

2) Given a field $F$, the notation $\overline{F}$ means that we have an [[algebraic closure]] of $F$.  

## Definition

The following is Definition 3.1 in [Inter-Universal Teichmüller theory I](#MochizukiIUTTI), on pg.61 (currently).

###### Definition

_Initial Θ-data_ is a 7-tuple $(\overline{F} / F, X_{F}, l, \underline{C}_{K}, \underline{\mathbb{V}}, \mathbb{V}^{bad}_{mod}, \underline{\epsilon})$ given the following data.

1) A [[number field]] $F$ such that $\sqrt{-1} \in F$. In other words, we have a field extension of the [[quotient ring]] $\mathbb{Q}[X] / (X^{2} + 1)$, which itself is a field because $X^{2} + 1$ is irreducible: see [[field extension]] for more details on this.

2) A scheme $X_{F}$ which is obtained by removing a closed point from an [[elliptic curve]] $E_{F}$ over $F$. The scheme structure on $X_{F}$ is that inherited from $E_{F}$ by virtue of the fact that $X_{F}$ is an open subset of (the underlying topological space of) $E_{F}$, as described at [[open subscheme]]. We require that $X_{F}$ satisfies certain conditions: TODO.
