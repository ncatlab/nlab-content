## Idea

There is a noticeable [[analogy]] between phenomena ([[theorems]]) in the theory of [[number fields]] and those in the theory of [[function fields]] over [[finite fields]] ([Weil 39](#Weil39), [Iwasawa 69](#Iwasaw69), [Mazur-Wiles 83](#MazurWiles83)), hence between the theories of the two kinds of _[[global fields]]_. When regarding [[number theory]] dually as [[arithmetic geometry]], then one may see that this analogy extends further to include [[complex analytic geometry]], the theory of [[complex curves]] (e.g. [Frenkel 05](#Frenkel05)). 

For instance ([Weil 39](#Weil39)) defined an invariant of a [[number field]] -- the _[[genus of a number field]]_-- which is analogous to the [[genus of a curve|genus]] of the [[algebraic curve]] on which a given [[function field]] is the [[rational functions]]. This is such as to make the statement of the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] for [[algebraic curves]] extend to [[arithmetic geometry]] ([Neukirch 92, chapter II, prop.(3.6)](#Neukirch92)).

It is also the function field analogy which induces the conjecture of the [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] by analogy from the the number-theoretic [[Langlands correspondence]]. Here one finds that the [[moduli stack of bundles]] over a [[complex curve]] is analogous in absolute [[arithmetic geometry]] to the [[coset space]] of the [[general linear group]] with coefficients in the [[ring of adeles]] of a number field, on which [[unramified]] [[automorphic representations]] are functions. Under this analogy the [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]] may be regarded as giving the [[groupoid cardinality]] of the [[moduli stack of bundles]] in [[arithmetic geometry]].

In summary then the analogy says that the theory of [[function fields]] looks much like a [[global analytic geometry]]-version of the theory [[complex curves]], and moreover the theory of [[number fields]] looks much like further globalizing this to the "absolute base field" [[F1]].


To date the function field analogy remains just that, an [[analogy]], though various research programs may be thought of as trying to provide a context in which the analogy would become a consequence of a systematic theory (see e.g. the introduction of [v.d. Geer et al 05](#vdgeer05)). This includes 

* [[Arakelov geometry]];

* geometry "over [[F1]]";

* [[global analytic geometry]].
