## Idea

A _modular form_  is a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]] that satisfies certain transformation property under the [[action]] of the [[modular group]]. Abstractly this transformation property makes the function a [[section]] of a certain [[line bundle]] on the [[quotient]] of the [[upper half plane]] that makes it the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] (over the [[complex numbers]]) or more generally a [[modular curve]].

Modular forms are also often called _classical [[automorphic forms]]_, see [below]()



Modular forms appear as the [[coefficient]] ring of the [[Witten genus]] on manifolds with rational [[string structure]]. For manifolds with actual [[string structure]] this refines to [[topological modular forms]], which are the [[homotopy groups]] of the [[spectrum]] [[tmf]].

###### Definition

An **(integral) [[modular form]]** of weight $w$ is a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]]

$$
  f : (\mathbb{R}^2)_+ \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

(complex numbers with strictly positive imaginary part) 

such that

1. if $A = \left( \array{a & b \\ c& d}\right) \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acting by $A : \tau \mapsto = \frac{a \tau + b }{c \tau + d}$ we have
 
   $$
     f(A(\tau)) = (c \tau + d)^w f(\tau)
   $$

   (notice that for $A = \left( \array{1 & 1 \\ 0& 1}\right)$ then  $f(\tau + 1) = f(\tau)$)

1. $f$ has at worst a pole at $\{0\}$ (for _weak_ modular forms this condition is relaxed)

   it follows that $f = f(q)$ with $q = e^{2 \pi i \tau}$ is a meromorphic funtion on the open disk.


1. **integrality** $\tilde f(q) = \sum_{k = -N}^\infty a_k \cdot q^k$ then $a_k \in \mathbb{Z}$

=--

More generally there is such a definition for $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ replaced by any other arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma \subset SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ (e.g. [Litt, def.1](#Litt)), giving modular forms on [[modular curves]].

### As functions on lattices

The reference for this definition  is [Calegari13](#Calegari13).

A modular form $f$ of weight $k$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is a function on lattices $\Lambda=\mathbb{Z}+\tau\mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{C}$ such that

1. $f(\mathbb{Z}+\tau\mathbb{Z})$ is holomorphic as a function of $\tau$

2. $f(\mu \Lambda)=\mu^{-k}$ for all $\mu\in\mathbb{C}^{\times}$

3. $f(\mathbb{Z}+\tau\mathbb{Z})$ is bounded as $\tau\to i\infty$.

### As functions on elliptic curves together with a choice of differential

Again the reference for this definition  is [Calegari13](#Calegari13).

Since [[elliptic curves]] over $\mathbb{C}$ can be defined in terms of lattices, the previous definition can also be expressed as follows.

A modular form $f$ of weight $k$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is a function on pairs $(E,\omega)$ where $E$ is an elliptic curve and $\omega\in H^{0}(E,\Omega_{E}^{1})$, such that

$$f(E,\mu\omega)=\mu^{-k}f(E,\omega)$$

and such that $f(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}+\tau\mathbb{Z})$ is bounded as $\tau\to i\infty$.

### As sections of a line bundle over the moduli stack
 {#AsSections}

More abstractly, for $\mathcal{M}_{ell}$ the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] (or rather its [[Deligne-Mumford compactification]]) and $A \to \mathcal{M}_{ell}$ the corresponding universal bundle, write $\Omega^1_{A/S}$ for the [[line bundle]] of fiberwise [[Kähler differential forms]]. Write $e$ for the 0-[[section]] of this line bundle. Then

$$
  \omega \coloneqq e^\ast \Omega^1_{A/S}
$$ 

is a [[line bundle]] over the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]]. A modular form of weight $k$  is a [[section]] of $\omega^{\otimes k}$. Using the Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism one can show that the space of cusp forms of weight $2$ are the differentials on the corresponding modular curve.


### For congruence subgroups
 {#ForCongruenceSubgroups}

Similarly one considers modular forms for [[congruence subgroups]] of the full [[modular group]], hence on the space of [[elliptic curves with level structure]].

### As automorphic forms
 {#AsAutomorphicForms}

Instead of regarding, as [above](#AsSections), modular forms as [[sections]] of a [[line bundle]] on a [[quotient]] of the [[upper half plane]], one may regard them alternatively as plain functions, but on the ([[Möbius group|projective]]) [[special linear group]] $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. (e.g. [Martin 13, section 2](Martin13), [Litt, section 2](#Litt)).

As such these functions are then invariant under the [[action]] of the [[modular group|modular]] [[subgroup]] $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\hookrightarrow SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and hence are really functions on the [[coset space]] $SL(2,\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ (for forms on moduli of elliptic curves) or more generally $\Gamma \backslash SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ (for forms on more general [[modular curves]]).

This generalizes to the case of other [[congruence subgroups]] (as [above](ForCongruenceSubgroups)). Generally such functions on [[coset spaces]] like this are called _[[automorphic forms]]_. See there for more.

For the history of the terminology "modular form"/"automorphic form" see also [this MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/124785/381).

## Properties

### Action by Hecke operators

Modular forms can be acted on by Hecke operators. Viewing a modular form as a function on lattices, the most common kind of Hecke operator $T_{n}$ acts on a modular form $f$ as follows:

$$T_{n}f(\Lambda)=\sum_{\Lambda'}f(\Lambda')$$

where the sum runs over all lattices $\Lambda'$ which are index $n$ subgroups of $\Lambda$. A modular form which is a simultaneous eigenvector is also called a _Hecke eigenform_ or simply _eigenform_.

A modular form which vanishes at the cusps (equivalently, whose zeroth Fourier coefficient is equal to $1$) is called _cuspidal_, or a _cusp form_. A cusp form is _normalized_ if its first Fourier coefficient is equal to $1$. For normalized cuspidal eigenforms of integer weight, the eigenvalue of the Hecke operator $T_{n}$ is exactly the $n$-th Fourier coefficient.

Hecke operators were first developed by [[Louis Mordell]] to study the conjectures of [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] on the tau function (the Fourier coefficients of the modular discriminant). They were later developed by (and named after) [[Erich Hecke]] who used them to study [[L-functions]]. 

### Relation to Galois representations

Modular forms can be used to construct [[Galois representations]]. For instance in the case of weight $2$ 
normalized eigenforms this is the Eichler-Shimura construction discussed in [DiamondShurman05, chapter 9](#DiamondShurman05). This was generalized to higher weight in [Deligne71](#Deligne71), and the case of weight $1$ comes from the work of [DeligneSerre74](#DeligneSerre74).

The problem of whether a Galois representation comes from some modular form is part of the problem of _modularity_. Known cases include the [[modularity theorem]] of [TaylorWiles95](#TaylorWiles95) and [BreuilConradDiamondTaylor2001](#BreuilConradDiamondTaylor2001). The former is notably an important part of [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem]]. 

On a more general level, as modular forms are a special case of automorphic forms, their relation to Galois representations is part of the [[Langlands program]].

### Relation of $MF_0(2)$ to the elliptic genus

Write $\Gamma_0(2) \hookrightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for the [[subgroup]] of the [[modular group]] on those elements $\left(\array{a & b \\ c & d}\right)$ for which $c = 0\, mod\, 2$.

A modular function for $\Gamma_0(2)$ is a [[meromorphic function]] on the [[upper half plane]] which transforms as a modular form under the action of $\Gamma_0(2) \hookrightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Write $MF_\bullet(\Gamma_0(2))$ for the ring of these.

There is a natural isomorphism

$$
  MF_\bullet(\Gamma_0(2)) \simeq \mathbb{C}[\epsilon, \delta]
$$

(see at [[elliptic genus]]) for the notation.

([Landweber-Ravenel-Stong 93, theorem 1.5 and sections 5.3, 5.8](#LandweberRavenelStong93))

### Relation to elliptic cohomology

For $E$ the [[elliptic cohomology theory]] associated to the [[elliptic curve]] $C$, then 

$$
  E_{2n} \simeq \omega(C)^{\otimes n}
$$

(where $\omega$ is the line bundle from [above ](#AsSections))

and 

$$
  E_{2n+1}\simeq 0
  \,.
$$
