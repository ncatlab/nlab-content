##Classical Triangulations##
###Aim###
The aim of this entry is to describe some of the classical versions of important concepts which are needed elsewhere. This may serve as an entry point for someone versed in a more classical version of algebraic topology, or being adept at the nPOV, and its ramifications, needs to bridge the gap to more classical ideas to understand some more classically written source. (It may also be useful if some classically written source is not at hand when you need it!) The exposition will be fairly 'classical with asides to explain the significance for later developments.

##Triangulations &#224; l'ancienne##
Let $X$ be a [[polyhedron]] (in the sense of polyhedral space), i.e. a space homeomorphic to the [[geometric realisation]] of a [[simplicial complex]]. 

+--{: .un_defn}
######Definition
A **classical triangulation** of $X$ is a pair $(K,f)$, where $K$ isn a simplicial complex and $f : |K|\to X$ is a homeomorphism.

 (In this context we will often drop the term 'classical' referring to 'triangulation' if there is little risk of confusion.)
