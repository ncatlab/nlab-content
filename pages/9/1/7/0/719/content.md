## Thin elements##

These occur in various contexts.

1. In the simplicial singular complex $SX$ of a topological space $X$ a singular simplex $f: \Delta^n \to X$ is called [[thin]] it it factors through a retraction $r: \Delta^n \to \Lambda^{n-1}_i$ to some horn of $\Delta^n$. Then the well known [[Kan]] condition on $SX$ can be stated as: _every horn in $SX$ has a thin filler._ There are  other fillers which depend on $X$. It is difficult to decide the laws on these elements.  

1. Keith Dakin's axioms on thin elements in a simplicial  set $K$ with subsets $T_n \subseteq K_n, n \geq 1$, of elements called _thin_ are 
: DT1) Degenerate elements are thin;
: DT2) Any horn has a unique thin filler;
: DT3) If all faces but one of a thin element are thin, then so is the remaining face. 

1. Ashley's theorem, conjectured by Dakin, is that the category of such  [[T-complexes]] is equivalent to that of [[crossed complexes]]. 

1. Brown and Higgins proved that cubical T-complexes are equivalent to crossed complexes, and to strict cubical $omega$-groupoids with connections. 

1. In that theory, the notion of thin element is crucial because it can be proved that any (multiple) composition of thin elements is thin, and because of the relation of thin elements to commutative shells. 

1. David Jones in his thesis developed the notion of Polyhedral T-complex, and gave sufficient axioms for these to be equivalent to crossed complexes.
