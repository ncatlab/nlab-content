In a [[partial order|poset]] or even [[preorder|proset]], the __down set__ of an element $x$ is the set
$$ x{\downarrow} = \{ y \;|\; y \leq x \} .$$

In a [[quasiorder]], the __strict down set__ of $x$ is the set
$$ x\dot{\downarrow} = \{ y \;|\; y \lt x \} .$$

If you think of a poset $P$ as a [[category]], then the down set of $x$ is the [[coslice category]] $x / P$.

A down set in the [[opposite category|opposite]] $P^{op}$ of $P$ is an [[up set]] in $P$.

Note: The term 'down set' is also often used for a [[lower set]], a more general concept.  In the terminology above, the down set of $x$ is the lower set [[Moore closure|generated by]] $x$.
