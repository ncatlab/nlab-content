First all, we have our [studip link](
https://www.studip.uni-goettingen.de/dispatch.php/course/overview?cid=cd3c8d093de4d8fd9c8245f25e75f851). You need to register in Flexnow and present at least once, if you want to obtain your credit for this seminar.

Our seminar follows mostly Goerss-Jardine (GJ)
