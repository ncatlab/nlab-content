## Idea

**Homotopy level** is another name for the notion of [[truncated object|truncation]] (particularly in [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] and their 
[[internal logic|internal language]] of [[homotopy type theory]]) in which the numbering is offset by 2:

a [[homotopy n-type]] is a [[type]] of homotopy level $n+2$.  

This offset in counting enables it to "start" at 0 rather than (-2), which is convenient when defining it by induction over the natural numbers in type theory.  Thus, the correspondence between the various terminologies is indicated in the following table.
