## Idea

A _curved $A_\infty$_ is defined just like an [[A-infinity algebra]], but allowing in the definition also a 0-ary operation. $m_0$. Including this means thte unary operation no longer squares to 0 but to be proportinal to the binary product with this constant

$$
  m_1 \circ m_1 \propto m_2(m_0,-)
  \,.
$$

This $m_0$ is called the _curvature_ of the curved $A_\infty$-algebra.

## Examples

* The curved [[BGG sequences]] under cup product yield curved $A_\infty$-algebras ([Calderbank-Diemer 00, section 6](#CalderbankDiemer00)).
