## Idea ##

Linear operators on [[normed space|normed spaces]] are continuous precisely iff they are bounded. A bornological space retains this property by definition.

+-- {: .standout}
The discussion below is about bornological CVSes, but there is a more general notion of [[bornological space]].

## Definition ##

A [[locally convex]] [[topological vector space]] $E$ is **bornological** if every circled, convex subset $A \subset E$ that absorbs every [[bounded set]] in $E$ is a neighbourhood of $0$ in $E$. Equivalently every [[seminorm]] that is bounded on bounded sets is continuous.

The **bornology** of a given [[TVS]] is the family of bounded subsets.

Given a locally convex [[TVS]] $E$ with initial topology $T_0$, there is a finest topology $T$ such that the family of bounded subsets of $T$ coincides with $T_0$. The space $E$ equipped with the topology $T$ is called the **bornologification** of $E$, or the **bornological space associated with** $(E, T_0)$

## Properties ##

### Maps on bornological spaces

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $U$ be a linear map from a bornological space $E$ to any locally convex [[TVS]], then the following statements are equivalent:

* $U$ is continuous,

* $U$ is bounded on bounded sets,

* $U$ maps [[null sequence|null sequences]] to null sequences.

### Relation to Banach spaces

Every [[inductive limit]] of [[Banach spaces]] is a bornological vector space. ([Alpay-Salomon 13, prop. 2.3](#AlpaySalomon13))

Conversely, every bornological vector space is an inductive limit of [[normed spaces]], and of [[Banach spaces]] if it is quasi-complete ([Schaefer-Wolff 99](#SchaeferWolff99))


## Examples ##

Every metrizible locally convex space is bornological, that is every [[Fr√©chet space]] and thus every [[Banach space]].
