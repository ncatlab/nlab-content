\section{Introduction}

_Diagrammatic knot theory_ is an approach to [[knot theory]] and surrounding fields in which [[link diagrams]] and generalisations are the principal means with which one works with [[knots]], [[links]], [[3-manifolds]], and other objects in [[geometric topology]]. It has a highly combinatorial and pictorial, and sometimes also elementary, flavour.

\section{Starting point}

The fundamental result, akin to the [[Nullstellensatz]] in algebraic geometry for instance, which makes this approach to knot theory possible is [[Reidemeister's theorem]]. 

\section{Invariants}

Invariants in diagrammatic knot theory are typically obtained by proving invariance under the [[Reidemeister moves]] or other collections of moves (usually including at least some of the Reidemeister moves).

\section{Purely diagrammatic fields}

Some modern flavours of knot theory, such as [[virtual knot theory]], are _defined_ diagrammatically, although geometric interpretations have sometimes later been found.
