Unsurprisingly, **category theory** is the theory of [[category|categories]].

But maybe surprisingly, category theory turns out to be much more than the study of a particular mathematical structure. The degree to which category theory for instance is more encompassing than [[group theory]] is more drastic than the simple straightforward generalization from the mathematical structure [[group]] to the mathematical structure [[category]] might suggest. This is one of the main reasons for interest in category theory: it seems to provide a unified language for mathematics.

Wouldn\'t it be simpler to list the entries that *aren\'t* related to category theory?
