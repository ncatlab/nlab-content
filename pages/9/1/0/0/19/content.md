Unsurprisingly, **category theory** is the theory of [[category|categories]].

But maybe surprisingly, category theory turns out to be much more than the study of a particular mathematical structure. The degree to which category theory for instance is more encompassing than [[group]] theory is is more drastic than the simple straightforward generalization from the mathematical structure [[group]] to the mathematical structure [[category]] might suggest.
