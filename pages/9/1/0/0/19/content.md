Unsurprisingly, **category theory** is the theory of [[category|categories]].

But maybe surprisingly, category theory turns out to be much more than the study of a particular mathematical structure. The degree to which category theory for instance is more encompassing than [[group theory]] is more drastic than the simple straightforward generalization from the mathematical structure [[group]] to the mathematical structure [[category]] might suggest. This is one of the main reasons for interest in category theory: it seems to provide a unified language for mathematics.

Wouldn\'t it be simpler to list the entries that *aren\'t* related to category theory?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says: I do this for the following reasons: 

a) I want eventually all the encyclopedic entries on the $n$Lab to be listed in the main headline entries such as [[sheaf and topos theory]] so that people can efficiently see which information exists on the $n$Lab and search for keywords.

b) I expect that eventually pure category theoretic definitions will not dominate the $n$Lab entries. Currently they clearly do, since we found ourselves explaining things from the bottom up. But as soon as we start working more seriously on more specialized topics, for instance on the [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] sections pure category theoretic entries will become the minority. Clearly, I think, we don't want the $n$Lab to be or remain a _just_ category theory dictionary.

Toby: I see, this list is only for such dictionary-like terms, not for everything that uses category theory in some way (which I think probably *will* continue to be most). But we can make it shorter by, say, removing everything that\'s about [[higher category theory]] and making a single link to that (just as we don\'t list everything under [[mathematics]]).

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Sure, whatever works best for us. I see that this list here is getting a bit out of control, but it is part of my general attempt to keep the entries we build listed alphabetically in the main index pages, so to allow at least some sort of global picture of the state of the wiki. The best solution would be some automatically created list. Hm, now that I say this: we should maybe start adding "catgegory: xyz"-labels to the entries, where "xyz" is one of the headline items. Hm...
