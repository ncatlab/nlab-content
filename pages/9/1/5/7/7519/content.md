##Idea

We have some group, $H$, with a subgroup, $A$, together with a monomorphism, $\theta : A\to H$.   The **HNN-extension** $H\ast_A$ is obtained by adjoining an element $t$ to $H$
subject to the relations:
$$t^{-1}at= \theta(a)$$
for all $a\in A$.

The idea is thus that the two copies of $A$ in $H$ given by $A$ itself and $\theta(A)$ become conjugate subgroups in $H\ast_A$.

##Link with graphs of groups

Examine the [[fundamental group of a graph of groups|fundamental group]] of the [[graph of groups]], $\mathcal{G}$, with underlying graph the graph with one vertex, $v$ and one edge, $e$ and nothing else. Take the vertex group, $G_v$, to be $H$, the edge group, $G_e$, to be $A$, and the two morphisms from $G_e$ to $Gv$ are the inclusion of $A$ into $H$ and the given monomorphism, $\theta$, then $\Pi_1(\mathcal{G})(v) \cong H*_A$.
