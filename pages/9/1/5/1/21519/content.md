## Idea

A _global quotient orbifold_ is an [[orbifold]] that is represented by a [[G-space]] $X$: To the extent that orbifolds are identified with [[topological groupoids]]/[[Lie groupoids]], a global quotient orbifold is represented by the [[action groupoid]] of $G$ [[action|acting]] on $X$. Understood as representing a [[topological stack]]/[[differentiable stack]], this is the [[quotient stack]] of $X$ by $G$. Understood in [[(âˆž,1)-topos theory]] this is the [[homotopy quotient]] $X \sslash G$.

The [[orbifold cohomology]] of global quotient orbifolds is a version of [[equivariant cohomology]] of $X$.

The orbifolds that are global quotients of [[smooth manifolds]] by the action of a [[discrete group]] are called _[[good orbifolds]]_, or _[[very good orbifolds]]_ if the group is even [[finite group|finite]]. All others are called _bad orbifolds_ ([Thurston 92, Ch. 13, Def. 13.2.3](good+orbifold#Thurston92)).
