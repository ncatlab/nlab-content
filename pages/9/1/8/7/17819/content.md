## Idea

An (abstract) clone is equivalent to a [[cartesian operad]] (that is, a [[cartesian multicategory]] with one object). However, clones are presented differently, with projections rather than with symmetries, contraction and weakening. Consequently, an abstract clones is equivalently considered a presentation of a single-sorted [[algebraic theory]] in terms of algebraic operations, equivalent to a [[Lawvere theory]] but organized slightly differently.

## Definition

A set of algebraic operations on a fixed set $S$ is a __(concrete) clone__
on $S$ if it contains all (component) projections $S^{n}\to S$ and is closed under composition ("superposition").

An **abstract clone** consists of an abstract set of "$n$-ary operations" for every $n$ together with projection and composition operations.  For now, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_%28algebra%29).  This is the notion that's equivalent to a cartesian operad or a Lawvere theory.
