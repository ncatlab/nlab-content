# Clones

## Idea

A clone is a [[cartesian multicategory]] with one object, in the same way that an [[operad]] is a [[symmetric multicategory]] with one object.  Thus, a clone could equivalently be called a *cartesian operad*.  Equivalently, a clone is a presentation of a single-sorted [[algebraic theory]] in terms of algebraic operations, equivalent to a [[Lawvere theory]] but organized slightly differently.

## Definition

A set of algebraic operations on a fixed set $S$ is a __clone__
on $S$ if it contains all (component) projections $S^{n}\to S$ and is closed under composition ("superposition").
