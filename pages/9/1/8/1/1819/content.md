Combinatorial simplicial model categories, i.e. [[model category|modelcategories]] that are both

* [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial model categories]]

* [[simplicial model category|simplicial model categories]]

are precisely those [[model category|model categories]] that present [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinity,1)-categories]] (see there for details).
