A [[connection on a bundle|connection]] that is [[flat connection|flat]] up to a central term.

In [[Cartan geometry|Cartan geometry]], a torsion-free affine connection $\nabla$  on a manifold is said to be projectively flat if the corresponding normal projective Cartan connection induced by the projective class of $\nabla$ is flat. For example, the Levi-Civita connection of a hyperbolic manifolds are projectively flat in this sense, because the corresponding normal standard tractor connection is flat.
