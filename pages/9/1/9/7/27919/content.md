## Idea

*Geometric topology*, as a field of [[mathematics]], is mainly concerned with characterizing [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embeddings]] of [[differentiable manifold|differentiable]]/[[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[manifolds]] ([[submanifolds]]).

This is closely related, and partially overlaps, with [[differential topology]] and [[low-dimensional topology]].
