## Idea

Where the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] formulate [[quantum field theory]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]], known as _[[algebraic quantum field theory]]_ (AQFT) there is a generalization of these axioms to [[curved spacetimes]] ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 01](#BrunettiFredenhagen01)), also known as _locally covariant algebraic quantum field theory_. For the case of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] this is _[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]]_, see there for more. 

(This falls short of being a theory of [[quantum gravity]], instead it describes [[quantum field theory]] on classical [[background field]] configurations of [[gravity]].)

This is the mathematically rigorous framework for studying subjects such as the [[cosmological constant]] (see [there](cosmological+constant#InPerturbativeQuantumGravity)), [[Hawking raditation]] or the [[cosmic microwave background]] ([Fredenhagen-Hack 13](#FredenhagenHack13)).


## Applications

### Vacuum energy and Cosmological constant

The [[renormalization]] freedom in [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[quantization]] of [[gravity]] ([[perturbative quantum gravity]]) induces freedom in the choice of [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[stress-energy tensor]] and hence in the [[cosmological constant]]. 

Review includes ([Hack 15, section 3.2.1](#Hack15)).

For more see at _[[cosmological constant]]_ [here](cosmological+constant#InPerturbativeQuantumGravity).

  > $[$ the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] $]$  taken  together  with  the  axioms  defining  a  [[C*-algebra]]  are  a  distillation  into  abstract  mathematical  language  of  all  the   general  truths  that  we  have  learned  about  the  physics  of  microscopic   systems  during  the  last  50 years. They  describe a  mathematical  structure of  great  elegance  whose  properties  correspond  in  many  respects  to  the facts  of  experimental  physics.  In  some  sense,  the  axioms  represent  the most  serious  attempt  that  has  yet  been  made  to  define  precisely  what physicists mean by the words "observability, causality, locality, relativistic invariance," which  they are constantly  using  or  abusing  in their  everyday speech. $[$...$]$ I therefore  propose as an  outstanding opportunity  still open to the pure mathematicians, to  create a mathematical structure preserving the  main features of the Haag-Kastler axioms but possessing E-invariance instead of P-invariance. 

$P$ here denotes the [[Poincaré group]], while $E$ denotes what Dyson calls the 'Einstein group', which is now called the [[diffeomorphism group]].
