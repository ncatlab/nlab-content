## Idea

"Quantum algebra" is an overloaded term with several related meanings whose usage depends on the given author. 

#### Quantum algebras as a class of algebras

For many people, *quantum algebra* is a synonym for *[[quantum group]]* or some related algebra (e.g. a deformed oscillator algebra, [[quantum homogeneous space]], quantum Schubert variety, [[Yangian]], [[quantum nilpotent algebra]] etc.). 

One usually assumes that quantum algebras are formal [[deformations]] of (typically finitely generated) [[commutative algebras]] or other standard algebras like the [[Weyl algebra|Weyl]] or [[Clifford algebras]]. Often [[operator algebras]] of similar nature are also viewed as quantum algebras, at least in the respective community.

Large [[noncommutative algebras]] (say free associative algebras and alike) are typically not called quantum. Nevertheless, few authors view any noncommutative associative algebra as quantum. 

#### Quantum algebras in quantizations

Often a [[quantization]] of some classical [[algebra of observables]], or of a related algebra of functions in [[classical mechanics]] or [[classical field theory]] is called the algebra of [[quantum observables]] or, somewhat more informally, the *quantum algebra of observables* (or an appropriate variant). 

#### Quantum algebras as a subject

By "quantum algebras" one often means a wider subject  which does not only include the study of quantum algebras in the above sense but also related mathematics, e.g. noncommutative [[Hopf algebras]] in general, [[associative bialgebroids]], [[braided monoidal categories]], low dimensional topological invariants (see [[quantum topology]]) like the knot and link invariants which stem say from research on [[R-matrices]] and related quantum algebras. It is recognized as one of the subject classes at arXiv.
