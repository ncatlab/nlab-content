This page aims to gather priceless snippets of mathematical wisdom about specific subjects, garnered from around the n-categorical blogosphere!

[Weighted colimits](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007688), explained nicely by John Baez as the _categorification of weighted sums_.

[Bernoulli numbers](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/02/metric_spaces.html#c014936), link to a problem sheet by John Baez with solution by Jeff Morton on everything you need to know.

[Framed cobordisms and TQFT's](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/02/new_hire_at_ucr.html#c016709), link to a classic comment by John Baez explaining how stable homotopy theory and extended TQFT become one and the same thing in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$.

[The link between duals for objects and adjoint functors](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/02/logicians_needed_now.html#c018557). Here Bruce described what extra condition you need, besides $V \otimes \dash$ being left adjoint to $V^* \otimes \dash$, to make sure that $V^*$ is a right dual of $V$ in the normal sense, and gave an example showing why this condition was necessary.
