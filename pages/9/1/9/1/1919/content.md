Given a [[set]] $X$, two [[subsets]] $A$ and $B$ of $X$ are __disjoint__ if their [[intersection]] is [[empty set|empty]].

There\'s more interesting stuff to say, about different strengths of disjoint in [[constructive mathematics]], and about generalisations and categorifications like [[disjoint coproducts]], but not now.
