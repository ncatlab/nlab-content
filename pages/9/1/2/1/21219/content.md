## Idea

Broadly, a _scalar quantity_ is a "basic form of quantity", in terms of which more sophisticated objects of [[algebra]] are defined; and/or a "plain form of quantity", not subject to non-trivial transformation laws.

Specifically:

* **in [[mathematics]]**, by a _scalar_ one typically means an [[element]] of a [[ground ring]] or [[ground field]] (see also: [[number]]);

  this usage appears in concepts such as _[[scalar product]]_, _[[extension of scalars]]_, _[[restriction of scalars]]_, ...

* **in [[physics]]**, by a _scalar_ one typically means an element of a [[trivial representation]] of a given [[symmetry group]];

  this usage appears in concepts such as _[[scalar field]]_, _[[scalar meson]]_, ..., and in partial negation in concepts such as _[[pseudoscalar]]_, ...

These two usages do overlap: The 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[trivial representation]] $\mathbf{1} \in Rep_k(G)$ of any [[symmetry group]] $G$ over any [[ground field]] $k$ has as [[underlying set]] that ground field itself: $\mathbf{1} \,\simeq_k\, k$.

For instance, the _[[scalar curvature]]_ in [[Riemannian geometry]] is a scalar(-valued [[function]]) in both senses of the word.
