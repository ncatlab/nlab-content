### Kant's categories of pure understanding

> In the Transcendental Analytic, the most crucial as well as the most difficult part of [Kant 1781 "The critique of pure reason"](#Kant1781), he maintained that physics is a priori and synthetic because in its ordering of experience it uses concepts of a special sort. These concepts&#8212;"categories," he called them&#8212;are not so much read out of experience as read into it and, hence, are a priori, or pure, as opposed to empirical. But they differ from empirical concepts in something more than their origin: their whole role in knowledge is different. For, whereas empirical concepts serve to correlate particular experiences and so to bring out in a detailed way how experience is ordered, the categories have the function of prescribing the general form that this detailed order must take. They belong, as it were, to the very framework of knowledge. But although they are indispensable for objective knowledge, the sole knowledge that the categories can yield is of objects of possible experience; they yield valid and real knowledge only when they are ordering what is given through sense in space and time. (from Encyclopedia Britannica)

According to [[Kant]] the _categories of pure understanding_  are (forming what is known as "the table of categories"):

1. [[quantity]]

   * unity

   * plurality

   * totality

1. [[quality]]

   * reality

   * negation
  
   * limitation

1. [[relation]]

   * inherence and subsistence ([[substance]] and accident)

   * causality and dependence (cause and effect)

   * community (reciprocity)

1. [[modality]]

   * [[possibility]]

   * actuality (_Wirklichkeit_)

   * [[necessity]]

### Hegel's categories of being

According to [[Hegel]] there is refinement of the table, both by adding more categories (and maybe by omitting some?) and by claiming to relate them more systematically by a system of [[unity of opposites]] and of [[Aufhebung|sublation]] of these oppositions. See at _[[Science of Logic]]_ for more on this. Hegel calls the categories the _determinations of being_.

### Lawvere's (co-)reflective categories

According to [[Lawvere]] the system of categories of Hegel are usefully formalized in [[categorical logic]] ("[[objective logic]]") as systems of (co-)[[reflective subcategories]] (in the sense of [[category]] in [[category theory]]) of some ambient [[topos]]. See also at _[[Science of Logic]]_ for more on this.
