## Definition
 {#Definition}

A [[locally small category]] $\mathcal{K}$ is **completely distributive** if it has [[small colimits]], [[small limits]], and the colimit functor $colim \colon \mathcal{PK} \to \mathcal{K}$ is [[continuous functor|continuous]].

More abstractly, there is a [[pseudodistributive law]] between the [[free cocompletion]] and the [[free completion]], for which the [[pseudoalgebras]] are the completely distributive categories.

## Examples

* Every [[totally distributive category]], in particular every [[presheaf category]] $[C^{op},Set]$ for small $C$ is completely distributive.
