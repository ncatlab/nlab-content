## Definition

For locally small $\mathcal{K}$ denote by $\mathcal{PK}$ the full subcategory of $[\mathcal{K}^{op},Set]$ on small colimits of representables. The category $\mathcal{K}$ is cocomplete iff the Yoneda embedding $Y:\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{PK}$ has a left adjoint $colim:\mathcal{PK}\to\mathcal{K}$. If $colim$ has a *further* left adjoint $W:\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{PK}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ is moreover complete, then it is called *completely distributive*.

## Examples

* Every [[totally distributive category]], in particular every [[presheaf category]] $[C^{op},Set]$ for small $C$ is completely distributive.
