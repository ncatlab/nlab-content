## Definition

A [[function]] on (some subset of) a [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with values in the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ is **smooth** if all its [[derivative]]s exist at all points. 

The concept can be generalised from cartesian spaces to [[Banach spaces]] and some other infinite-dimensional spaces.  There is a [[locale]]-based analogue suitable for [[constructive mathematics]] which is not described as a function of points but as a special case of a [[continuous map]] (in the localic sense).

A [[manifold]] whose transition functions are smooth functions is a [[smooth manifold]]. The [[category]] [[Diff]] is the category whose objects are smooth manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth functions betweeen them.
