A [[function]] on (some subset of) a [[cartesian space]] with values in $\mathbb{R}$ is **smooth** if all its [[derivative]]s exist at all points.


A [[manifold]] whose transition functions are smooth functions is a [[smooth manifold]]. The [[category]] [[Diff]] is the category whose objects are smooth manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth functions betweeen them.
