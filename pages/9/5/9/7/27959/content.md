## Idea

Recall first that a ([[topological vector bundle|topological]]) [[line bundle]] over a ([[topological field|topological]]) *[[field]]* (or more generally a ([[topological ring|topological]]) [[ring]]) $\mathbb{K}$ is, by definition, a [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]]=1 $\mathbb{K}$-[[vector bundle]] and hence a $\mathbb{K}$-[[fiber bundle]] with [[structure group]] the [[group of units]] $GL(1,\mathbb{K}) \simeq \mathbb{K}^\times$. It is then typically a [[theorem]] that (over [[paracompact topological spaces]]) such [[fiber bundles]] all arise, up to [[isomorphism]], as [[pullback bundle|pullbacks]] of the [[tautological line bundle]] on [[infinite projective space]] $\mathbb{K}P^\infty$, so that their [[isomorphism classes]] are identified with the [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous maps]] to this [[classifying space]] $\mathbb{K}P^\infty$.

Now, the [[octonions]] $\mathbb{O}$ are not an ([[associativity|associative]]) [[ring]] and so a would-be [[group of units]] "$\mathbb{O}^\times$" which could serve as the [[structure group]] of $\mathbb{O}$-[[fiber bundles]] does not exist. This means that the usual definition of $\mathbb{K}$-[[line bundles]] does not generalize to $\mathbb{K} \coloneqq \mathbb{O}$.

However, the notion of a [[tautological line bundle]] over the [[octonionic projective line]] $\mathbb{O}P^1$ still does make sense, and this ([[rank of a vector bundle|rank]]=8 [[real vector bundle]]) is commonly called the *tautological octonionic line bundle* or the "canonical octonionic line bundle".

By the above analogy it is then justified (though not common in the literature) to *define* general *octonionic line bundles* to be, up to [[isomorphism]], the [[pullback bundles]] of this tautological one along [[continuous maps]] to [[octonionic projective line|$\mathbb{O}P^1$]].
