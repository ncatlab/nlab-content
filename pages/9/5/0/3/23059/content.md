##Idea

A lattice ordered group is a group which is also a lattice in a compatible way.

##Partially ordered groups.
 
 First we introduce _partially ordered groups_. 

A group $G$ is said to be _partially ordered_ if it is equipped with a partial order, $\le$, which is compatible with the group multiplication, $\cdot$, so, if $g\leq h$ then $g\cdot k\leq h\cdot k$ and also $k\cdot g\leq k\cdot h$ for any $g,h,k \in G$.

##Lattice ordered groups.

If $G,\leq)$ is a partially ordered group, and the partial order is a lattice, then we say $G$ is a _lattice ordered group_, so for each pair , $a,b$ in $G$ has a [[join]], $a \vee b$ and a [[meet]], $a\wedge b$.

Some sources abbreviate 'lattice ordered groups' to '$\ell$-group'.

##Properties 

* The group operation distibutes over both $\vee$ and $\wedge$.

* A sort of de Morgan's law holds, so $(a\vee b)^{-1}= a^{-1}\wedge b^{-1}$. THis is easily proved once one notes that inversion reverses the order.
