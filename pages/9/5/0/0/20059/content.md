## General

These are a class of model structures on certain categories of [[cubical sets]], due to [[Christian Sattler]], motivated by [[cubical type theory]].

### Assumptions

Let $\mathbb{C}$ be a [[small category]] with [[finite products]].
Assume there is a (cartesian) [[interval object]] $\mathbb{I}$, i.e.,
an object $\mathbb{I}$ with two morphisms $0,1 : e \to \mathbb{I}$,
where $e$ is the terminal object in $\mathbb{C}$.

Assume further that we have [[connection on a cubical set|connection
maps]] $\vee,\wedge : \mathbb{I}\times\mathbb{I} \to \mathbb{I}$ such
that $x \vee 0 = 0 \vee x = x$ and $x \wedge 1 = 1 \wedge x = x$.

We also need a face lattice $\mathbb{F}$, that is, a sublattice of the
[[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ in the [[presheaf category]] $cSet =
\mathbb{C}^{op} \to Set$ containing the endpoints of each cylinder
$J^+ = J \times \mathbb{I}$ for each object $J$ of $\mathbb{C}$, and
an operation $\forall : \mathbb{F}^\mathbb{I} \to \mathbb{F}$ right
adjoint to the projection in the sense that $\psi \le \forall \delta$
iff $\psi p \le \delta$, where $p : \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{I} \to
\mathbb{F}$.

If we want the model to be effective, we also require that each
proposition $\psi = 1$ with $\psi \in \mathbb{F}(I)$ is decidable.
(This rules out taking $\mathbb{F} = \Omega$.)

### Instances of the assumptions

A simple and central example is the full subcategory of the category
of [[posets]] $Pos$ on powers of $\mathbb{I} = (0 \lt 1)$. This is
also the [[Lawvere theory]] of [[distributive lattices]]. The
[[idempotent completion]] is the full subcategory of $Pos$ on finite
lattices.

Other prominent examples are the Lawvere theories of [[de Morgan algebra|de
Morgan]], [[Kleene algebra|Kleene]], and [[boolean algebra|boolean]] algebras.

For computational purposes we can take $\mathbb{F}$ to be the smallest
lattice containing the cylinder endpoints (the faces of cubes). To get
[[Cisinski model structures]] we can take $\mathbb{F} = \Omega$.

## Equivalence with simplicial sets
One may wonder whether these models structures are equivalent to the model in [[simplicial sets]].
This is not the case for Cartisian cubes; see [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/homotopytypetheory/RQkLWZ_83kQ/tAyb3zYTBQAJ). However, this model does form a Grothendieck [[(infinity,1)-topos]], because it satisfies the Giraud axioms. For deMorgan cubical sets the geometric realization is not a Quillen equivalence (because of the reversal map); the counterexample is the unit interval quotient by the symmetry); see [Sattler](#sattlerHIM). Whether they are equivalent by another map is not yet excluded.
The question whether the geometric realization for the cubical sets based on distribute lattices is an equivalence is still open.
