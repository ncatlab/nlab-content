An algebraic variety or an algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is normal if at every point $p$ the stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is integrally closed domain. For every variety $X$ there is a morphism $X\to \mathcal{X}$ which is universal among all morphisms from $X$ into normal varieties; $\mathcal{X}$ is (or more precisely $\mathcal{X}$ together with the universal morphism) said to be the __normalization of__ $X$.
