A __bicartesian closed category__ is a [[cartesian closed category]] with finite [[coproducts]]. In the case where this is furthermore a [[preorder]] or [[poset]], it is called a [[Heyting prealgebra]] or [[Heyting algebra]], respectively. They provide the semantics and proof theory of [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[propositional logic]].

Note that a bicartesian closed category is [[bicartesian category|bicartesian]] (that is, it is both [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] and [[cocartesian monoidal category|cocartesian]]), and furthermore it is cartesian closed, but it is usually *not* [[cocartesian closed category|cocartesian closed]].  Thus the terminology could be confusing, but since the only cocartesian closed categories are trivial, there is not much danger.

A bicartesian closed category is one kind of [[2-rig]].
