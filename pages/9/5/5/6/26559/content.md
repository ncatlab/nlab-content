 {#Outline}


([ยง2](#FluxDensitiesAndBraneSources)) A *[[higher gauge theory]]* (review in [Alfonsi 2024, ยง2](#Alfonsi24); [BFJ${}^+$ 2024](#BFJKNRSW24)) [of Maxwell-type](higher+gauge+field#HigherGaugeTheoryOfMaxwellType) is a ([[quantum field theory|quantum]]) [[field theory]] analogous to [[vacuum]]-[[electromagnetism]] ([[AQFT on curved spacetimes|on curved spacetimes]]), but with the analog of the electromagnetic [[flux density]] $F_2$ ([which ordinarily is](electromagnetic+field#FieldStrengthAsClosed2Form) a [[differential 2-form]] on 3+1 [[dimension of a manifold|dimensional]] [[spacetime]] $X^4$)  allowed to be a system of [[differential forms]] $\vec F \,\equiv\, \big\{F^{(i)}\big\}_{i \in I}$ of any degree $deg_i \geq 1$ on a [[dimension of a manifold|$D$-dimensional]] [[spacetime]] $X^D$ of any dimension $D = d+1 \geq 2$, and satisfying a higher (see Def. \ref{HigherMaxwellEquations} below) analog of [[Maxwell's equations]].

Such [[higher gauge theories]] famously appear as the [[higher gauge field|gauge field]]-sector in higher-dimensional [[supergravity]] and hence in [[superstring|super]]-[[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]], which is where they draw most of their motivation from. 

In analogy to how for ordinary [[Maxwell theory]] one may think of [[singularities]] or stable bumps in the [[flux density]] $F_2$ as being sourced by [[charges]] carried by (hypothetical) [[Dirac monopoles]] or by (observed) [[Abrikosov vortex strings]], respectively, so one may think of [[singularities]] or stable bumps in these higher flux densities as sourced by [[singular branes]] or [[solitonic branes]], respectively, for suitably higher dimensional ([[membrane|mem-]])[[branes]] carrying suitable higher charges.

But for [[singular brane|singular]]/[[solitonic branes]] to be "[[elementary particle|elementary]]" objects of individually discernible nature, their charges, and hence the total fluxes which they source, should have discrete ("quantized") values (as indeed observed for [[Abrikosov vortex strings]]). This is the topic of *[[flux quantization]]*:

\linebreak

([ยง3](#FluxQuantizationLaws)) Just as for [[electromagnetism]], these higher [[flux densities]] themselves do not yet constitute the full [[field (physics)|field]]-content of the given higher gauge theory. 

Traditionally one declares the full [[higher gauge field|higher]] [[gauge field]] to be given by [[gauge potentials]] $\vec A$ whose differential *locally* contributes to the given flux density, $\vec F \,=\, \mathrm{d} \vec A + \cdots$ and which is *globally* subjected to a topological condition which implies *[[flux quantization|flux and charge quantization]]* of the total fluxes and (brane-)charges, making them form a [[discrete space]] reflecting the nature of *individual* ("[[elementary particle|elementary]]") branes carrying/sourcing discrete units of charges/fluxes (as famously observed for [[Abrikosov vortex strings]]). 
But from this point of view it is far from transparent how to identify the structure of gauge potentials for general higher gauge theories.

More systematically, we may understand [[flux quantization]] as the specification of the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] charge/flux sectors in ([[nonabelian cohomology|non-abelian]]) [[generalized cohomology]] of which the [[flux densities]] are but differential-geometric [[Chern-Dold character|characters]], and observe that the corresponding higher [[gauge potentials]] and hence the full field content of the higher gauge theory arise automatically as the [[homotopy theory|homotopy]]/[[higher gauge theory|gauge theoretic]] witnesses of the resulting [[flux quantization]], making the full higher gauge fields be [[cocycles]] in a corresponding ([[nonabelian differential cohomology|nonabelian]]) [[differential cohomology]] theory.

\linebreak

([ยง4](#Examples)) Examples of [[flux quantization]] beyond [[Dirac charge quantization]] in [[electromagnetism]] play a key role in [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]]: 

  * the seminal "Hypothesis K" postulating [[D-brane charge quantization in K-theory]],

  * the more recent "[[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]" postulating [[M-brane]] charge quantization in unstable [[twisted Cohomotopy|twisted]] [[Cohomotopy]].

These hypotheses are not unrelated: Under "[[double dimensional reduction|double dimensional]] [[Kaluza-Klein reduction]]" along a [[circle]] [[fiber]] the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] fluxes on $X^{10+1}$ are to give rise to *most* of the [[B-field|$B$-]]/[[RR-field]]-fluxes in $X^{9+1}$ (as part of the [[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]], which is either conjectural or defining, depending on attitude towards the definition of the elusive [[M-theory]]). Therefore [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] may be understood as providing an [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]]/[[M-theory|M-theoretic]] *lift* of [[D-brane charge quantization in K-theory|Hypothesis K]] to the extent that it reduces to the latter under [[double dimensional reduction]], and as an [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]]/[[M-theory|M-theoretic]] *correction* to the extent that it does not quite reduce to Hypothesis K.

While the discussion of the fine-grained predictions and mutual (in)compatibilities of these flux-quantization laws is beyond the scope of this review, these examples serve to highlight nature of the space of choices of flux quantization laws and with them the general mechanism of flux quantization --- which previous more *ad hoc*-discussions have barely brought out.

Notice therefore that a *choice* of flux quantization is (depending on perspective of how that higher gauge theory is ultimately defined):

* a hypothesis about 

or else

* a specification of 

the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative completion]] of the given [[higher gauge theory]], which is generally an issue that deserves (more) attention.

Traditionally, flux quantization laws have been postulated sporadically and in ad-hoc fashion, in order to patch up "anomalous" theories: 
Since the ancient past it is common to define any [[theory (physics)|physical theory]] by a [[stationary action principle]] embodied by a [[Lagrangian density]], from which a perturbative [[BRST complex]] is extracted, whose [[quantization]] (e.g. [Henneaux & Teitelboim 1992](#HenneauxTeitelboim92)) is generally afflicted with problems ("[[quantum anomalies|anomalies]]") some of which are dealt with by ad-hoc flux quantization: For example the original [[Dirac charge quantization]] was postulated to cure an anomaly in the quantum theory of an [[electron]] propagating in the background field of a [[magnetic monopole]] (a "0-brane"), while the enigmatic [[shifted C-field flux quantization]] similarly serves to cure an anomaly in the quantum theory of the [[M2-brane]] propagating in the background field of an [[M5-brane]] ([Witten 1996a, ยง2.2](#Witten96a)).

In contrast, in the modernized picture reviewed here, the available choices of flux-quantization laws $\mathcal{A}$ are [[algebraic topology|algebro-topologically]] determined by the form of the higher [[Gauss law]] on any [[Cauchy surface]], and any such choice, given by a compatible [[non-abelian cohomology]]-theory, determines the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[phase space]] [[smooth infinity-stack|stack]] of flux-quantized gauge fields. This process makes no reference to [[Lagrangian densities]] and applies seamlessly to field theories that do not even have a natural Lagrangian description, such as [[self-dual higher gauge theories]].

Typically there is an "evident" choice of flux quantization and this is the choice tacitly made in the literature, where considered at all. But it is important to notice that there are other admissible choices, embodying hypotheses about (or definitions of) non-evident nonperturbative completions of the given higher gauge theory. 

The following table shows in outline the logic of algebra-topological flux quantization; on the left in generality and on the right for our three running examples:

1. traditional [[Dirac charge quantization]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] (experimentally well-supported);

1. traditional [[D-brane charge quantization in topological K-theory|D-brane charge quantization]] in [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[topological K-theory]] ("Hypothesis K", still facing various challenges);

1. more recent [[M-brane]]$\;$[[shifted C-field flux quantization|charge quantization]] in unstable [[twisted Cohomotopy|twisted]] [[Cohomotopy]] ("[[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]").

\end{imagefromfile}


As this table indicates, the [[algebraic topology|algebro-topological]] nature of flux/charge quantization is [[higher Lie theory|higher Lie theoretic]] (explained in [ยง3](#FluxQuantizationLaws)), by matching two [[L-infinity algebras|$L_\infty$-algebras]] associated with a given [[higher gauge theory]] [of Maxwell type](higher+gauge+field#HigherGaugeTheoryOfMaxwellType) ([ยง2](#FluxDensitiesAndBraneSources)):

**(i)** The higher [[Gauss law]] of a [[higher gauge theory]] [of Maxwell-type](higher+gauge+field#HigherGaugeTheoryOfMaxwellType) is equivalent to the condition that the [[flux densities]] jointly constitute a [[flat L-infinity algebra valued differential form|closed $L_\infty$-algebra valued differential form]] with values in a characteristic [[L-infinity algebra|$L_\infty$-algebra]] $\mathfrak{a}$;

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-GaussLawAsFlatnessCondition-240123.jpg",
    "width": 740,

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

**(ii)** The [[classifying space]] $\mathcal{A}$ of the topological flux/charge sector is [[rational homotopy type|rationally]] characterized by its [[rational numbers|rational]] [[Whitehead L-infinity algebra|Whitehead $L_\infty$-algebra]]  $\mathfrak{l}\mathcal{A}$ (essentially the "Quillen model" of $\mathcal{A}$: that $L_\infty$-algebra whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{l}\mathcal{A})$ is the [[Sullivan model]] of $\mathcal{A}$) and the nonabelian [[Chern-Dold character]] map extracts from $\mathcal{A}$-cohomology its image in $\mathfrak{l}\mathcal{A}$-valued [[nonabelian de Rham cohomology]]:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "NonabCharacter-240123.jpg",
    "width": 840,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}
 
\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-FirstIdeaFluxQuantization-240123.jpg",
    "float": "right",
    "width": 580,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


That these two $L_\infty$-algebras coincide is the condition on the choice of the flux quantization law embodied by $\mathcal{A}$; and it implies that the non-abelian [[Chern-Dold character map]] $ch_{\mathcal{A}}$ from the [[non-abelian cohomology]]-theory classified by $\mathcal{A}$ takes values in the [[non-abelian de Rham cohomology]] with coefficients in $\mathfrak{l}\mathcal{A}$, which under $\mathfrak{l}\mathcal{A} \simeq \mathscr{a}$ identifies with the deformation classes of [[flux densities]] satisfying their higher [[Gauss law]].

Finally, given such a choice of flux quantization law $\mathcal{A}$, the [[gauge potentials]] and hence the full [[moduli stack]] of [[higher gauge fields]] appears by forming the above matching not just as an identification in [[non-abelian de Rham cohomology]] but as a [[homotopy fiber product]] of the corresponding [[moduli stacks]]: This makes the full flux-quantized [[higher gauge fields]] be [[cocycles]] in [[nonabelian differential cohomology]] with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$.

\begin{remark}
**(the role of [[L-infinity algebra|$L_\infty$-algebras]]: curvature-coefficients instead of gauge potiential-coefficients)**
\linebreak
In comparison to more traditional discussions, beware that the (possibly non-abelian) [[L-infinity algebra|$L_\infty$-algebra]] $\mathfrak{a}$ here controls the (possibly non-linear) [[Bianchi identities]]/[[Gauss law]] satisfied by the [[curvature forms]]/[[flux densities]] --- and thus is *not* the (higher) Lie algebra in which the [[gauge potentials]] take values, if any. (Even in the abelian case, where both types of coefficient $L_\infty$-algebras make sense, they differ by a degree-shift.)

This is an underappreciated use of [$L_\infty$-algebras in physics](L-infinity-algebra#ReferencesInPhysics), but it is known from the ["FDA"-method in supergravity](D'Auria-Fre+formulation+of+supergravity) and is tacitly familiar in traditional discussion of RR-flux/D-brane charge: 

Here the characteristic $L_\infty$-algebra $[b_2, \, v_{2\bullet-1}] = v_{2\bullet + 1}$ bears no resemblance to the [[Lie algebra]] [[special unitary Lie algebra|$\mathfrak{su}(n)$]], and yet after choosing [[D-brane charge quantization in topological K-theory]] it follows (an algebro-topological form of "[[gauge enhancement]]") that gauge potentials with coefficients in $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ (namely [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on Hermitean [[vector bundles]]) provide [[cocycles]] for the resulting [[differential K-theory]]. It is in this way (RR-flux quantization $\rightsquigarrow$ K-theory $\rightsquigarrow$ gauge bundles as cocycles) that non-abelian [[gauge fields]] appear on [[D-branes]].

In fact, flux quantization as discussed here does not apply to [[su(n)|$\mathfrak{su}(n)$]]-[[Yang-Mills theory]] directly:

Generally, not all [[L-infinity algebras|$L_\infty$-algebras]] appear as rational [[Whitehead L-infinity algebras|Whitehead $L_\infty$-algebras]] of (the [[homotopy type]] of) a space $\mathcal{A}$ that is amenable to [[rationalization]]; those that do are "[[nilpotent L-infinity algebra|nilpotent]]". 
Specifically, [[su(n)|$\mathfrak{su}(n)$]] ($n \geq 2$) is not a [[nilpotent Lie algebra]], which relates to the fact that flux quantization as discussed here --- while it does apply to non-linear/non-abelian higher Bianchi identities such as for the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] --- does not apply directly to [[Yang-Mills theory]] with gauge Lie algebra [[su(n)|$\mathfrak{su}(n)$]] (or other [[classical Lie algebras]]).

## Flux densities and Brane sources

### Electromagnetic flux and its "branes"
 {#OrdinaryElectromagneticFluxAndItsBranes}

[[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] observed "lines of force" -- now called *flux of the magnetic field* -- concentrating towards the *poles* of rod magnets:

\end{imagefromfile}

In modern [[differential geometry|differential-geometric]] formulation, the [[flux density|density of these flux lines]] through any given [[surface]]-element is encoded in a [[differential 2-form]] $F_2$:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-FluxDensityAs2Form-240124.jpg",
    "width": 600,

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


More in detail, with respect to any [[foliation]] of [[spacetime]] $X^4$ by [[spacelike]] [[Cauchy surfaces]] $X^4 \simeq \mathbb{R}^1 \times X^d$ (assuming [[globally hyperbolic spacetime|global hyperbolicity]]), the spatial component of $F_2$ is the *magentic flux density* $B$, while the [[Hodge duality|Hodge dual]]  (with respect to $X^4$) of the temporal component is the *electric flux density* $E$.

Imagining, as Dirac did, that Faraday's rod magnet could be made *infinitely* long and thin, any one of its poles would look like an isolated [[monopole|mono-pole]] with flux concentrating towards it from all directions:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "MagneticMonopole-240124.jpg",
    "width": 600,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

At the point of the idealized monopole itself, the flux density $B$ per unit volume would diverge -- a "singularity" much in the sense of [[black holes]], which therefore we do not regard to be part of spacetime(time): The spacetime domain on which to discuss the fluxes sourced by a magnetic monopole is not [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ itself, but its  [[complement]] around the [[worldline]] $\mathbb{R}^{0,1}$ of the would-be monopole:

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{3,1} 
    \setminus
  \mathbb{R}^{0,1}
  \;
  \underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}
  \;
  \mathbb{R}^{0,1}
  \times
  \big(
    \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{0\}
  \big)
  \;
  \underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}
  \;
  \mathbb{R}^{0,1} 
  \times 
  R^1_{\gt 0}
  \times S^2
  \;
  \underset{\mathrm{hmtp}}{\simeq}
  \;
  S^2
  \,.
$$

As such, magnetic monopoles are the *[[singular brane|singular]] 0-[[branes]]* of electromagnetism --- in theory: Whether magnetic monopoles exist in nature remains open; they have not been seen in [[experiment]], but there are decent theoretical arguments that they should exist in [[grand unified theories]].

On the other hand, the "[[solitonic branes]] of electromagnetism" are experimentally well-established (and have famously been regarded as actual 1-[[branes]] ([[strings]]) approximated by a [[Nambu-Goto action]]: [Nielsen & Olesen 1973](vortex+string#NielsenOlesen73); [Polyakov 2008, p. 1](vortex+string#Polyakov08); [Beekman & Zaanen 2011](vortex+string#BeekmanZaanen11)): These are the [[Abrikosov vortices]] formed in [[type II superconductors]] with in a transverse magnetic field:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "SuperconductorVortexStructure-230304.jpg",
    "width": 720,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    },
    "caption": "adapted from [Loudon and Midgley 2009](superconductivity#LoudonMidgley09)"
\end{imagefromfile}

In this case the "sphere" through which the total magnetic flux density is measured is nominally the [[plane]] filled by the superconducting material, but since far away from any vortex the magentic flux has to vanish, this plane appears to the fluxes via its [[one-point compactification]] with the "point at infinity" adjoined.

These vortex strings are *[[solitons]]* in that the flux density is everywhere finite, and yet the "bumps" in the flux density are topologically stable. Much like a bump in a rug cannot be flattened as long as the boundary of the rug is fixed in place, so the requirement that flux densities "[[vanishing at infinity|vanish at infinity]]" keeps the vortex strings in place --- or at least this is the case once we take account of [[Dirac flux quantization]] below.

In summary:

\begin{imagefromfile}

\end{imagefromfile}


The fact that there are, generally, these two kinds of "branes imprinted on flux" is "well-known" and yet underappreciated:

\linebreak


### Singular versus solitonic branes
 {#TheDistinctionBetweenSingularAndSolitonicBranes}

Imprinted on [[flux densities]] may be *two kinds* of [[branes]], here to be called:

1.  **[[singular branes]]** ([[black branes]]) reflected in **diverging flux density** at **singular loci** that are to be removed from spacetime,

    > Beware that in [[supergravity]] these are also called "elementary branes" &lbrack;[Duff & Lu 1994](#DuffLu94)&rbrack;, in reference to how [[black holes]] carry the same quantum numbers as [[elementary particles]] -- but here we rather not conflate these two aspects.

1. **[[solitonic branes]]** reflected in **finite flux density** which is localized in that it **[[vanishing at infinity|vanishes at infinity]]**, transversally.

   >  The terminology "[[solitonic brane]]" was introduced in [Duff, Khuri & Lu 1992](solitonic+brane#DuffKhuriLu92), [1994](solitonic+brane#DuffKhuriLu94) and [Duff & Lu 1993](solitonic+brane#DuffLu93), [1994](#DuffLu94) to mean stable but non-singular brane-like solutions to (supergravity/flux) equations of motion ("[[solitons]]"). 

**Singular points and points at infinity.**
More formally, one may encode these two cases by  slightly adjusting the nature of the **spacetime domain** on which fluxes are actually defined &lbrack;cf. [SS23-MF, ยง2.1](#SS23-MF)&rbrack;:

1. fluxes sourced by [[singular branes]] of [[dimension]] $p+1$ inside [[spacetime]] $X^{d+1}$ are actually defined on the [[complement]] $X^{d+1} \setminus Q^{p+1}$ of their singular [[worldvolume]],

1. fluxes sourced by [[solitonic branes]] 
of [[codimension]] $d-p$ are actually defined on their transverse space $T^{d-p}$ equipped with a "[[point at infinity]]" on which they are required to vanish.

\end{imagefromfile}

Here the condition of flux densities [[vanishing at infinity]] on some space is naturally formalized by considering the larger [[category]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] $(X, x \in X)$ (we discuss further below how to properly speak of differential geometric smoothness in this context) and regarding their given "base point" as being the "point at infinity", whence we shall write $(X, \infty_X)$ for the generic pointed space. Then a function "[[vanishing at infinity]]" on $(X,\infty_X)$ is a function on $X$ that literally vanishes at $\infty_X$.

For example:

1. The result of *adjoining* to $\mathbb{R}^n$ its "point at infinity" (this is called its *[[one-point compactification]]*, here to be denoted $\mathbb{R}^n_{\cup \{\infty\}}$) is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]] with any basepoint: 

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^n_{\cup \{\infty\}} 
       \,\underset{homeo}{\simeq}\, 
     S^n
     \,.
   $$

1. On the other hand, to consider unconstrained functions on some $X$ in this context, we may regard all the points of $X$ as being at finite distance by declaring that the "point at infinity" is disjoint from $X$, hence by considering the [[disjoint union]] (denoted "$\sqcup$" as opposed to "$\cup$"):
 
   $$
     X_{\sqcup \{\infty\}}
     \;\coloneqq\;
     X \sqcup \{ \infty \}
     \,.
   $$

Given two such pointed spaces, their *[[smash product]]* "$\wedge$" is their [[Cartesian product]] with all points that are at infinity in either factor identified with a single new point at infinity:

$$
  \big(
    X,\, \infty_X
  \big)
  \wedge
  \big(
    Y,\, \infty_Y
  \big)
  \;\;
  \coloneqq
  \;\;
  \frac{
    X \times Y
  }{
    X \times \{\infty_Y\}
    \,\cup\,
    \{\infty_X\} \times Y
  }
$$

\linebreak

**The case of flat branes.**
For example, in the case of *flat branes* (i.e. with [[Cartesian space|Cartesian]] [[worldvolumes]] inside [[Minkowski spacetime]]), both these spacetime domains are [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalence]] to [[spheres]], but of differen dimensions:

(1.) Spacetime domain for flat singular branes:

\begin{imagefromfile}

    "width": 700,

        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

\begin{example}
In the case of ordinary electromagnetic flux ([above](#OrdinaryElectromagneticFluxAndItsBranes)) it follows from this general reasoning that a flux density 2-form $F_2$ in $D=3+1$ may reflect the presence of 

1. singular 0-branes with spacetime domain 

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^{3,1} \setminus \mathbb{R}^{0,1} 
       \,\underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}\, 
     \mathbb{R}^{0,1} \times \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0} \times S^2  
       \,\underset{\mathrm{hmtp}}{\simeq}\, 
     S^2
   $$

1. solitonic 1-branes with spacetime domain

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^{1,1}_+ 
       \wedge 
     \mathbb{R}^{2}_{\cup \{\infty\}}
     \;\underset{homeo}{\simeq}\;
     \mathbb{R}^{1,1}_+ 
       \wedge 
     S^2
     \;\underset{hmtp}{\simeq}\;
     S^2
   $$

which are exactly the familiar cases of [[magnetic monopoles]] (hypothetical) and [[Abrikosov vortex strings]] (observed).
\end{example}

This general distinction between [[singular branes]] and [[solitonic branes]] is important for the correct understanding of the implications of choices of [[flux quantization]]-laws on the corresponding brane charges.

### Higher fluxes and their brane sources
 {#HigherFluxAndItsBranes}

On the backdrop of ordinary electromagnetic flux ([above](#OrdinaryElectromagneticFluxAndItsBranes)) and the general rule for measuring flux sourced by [[singular branes]] or [[solitonic branes]] ([above](#TheDistinctionBetweenSingularAndSolitonicBranes)) it clearly makes sense to consider [[theory (physics)|physical theories]] of [[higher gauge fields]] whose precise nature remains to be discussed, but whose flux densities are reflected in higher-degree differential forms $F^{(i)}_{deg_i}(X^D)$, these possibly being of different field species to be labeled by a [[finite set|finite]] [[index set]] $I \in Set$ and jointly to be denoted as follows:

\[
  \label{TheHigherFluxDensities}
  \vec F
  \;\equiv\;
  \Big\{
    F^{(i)}_{\mathrm{deg}_i}
    \,\in\,
    \Omega_{dR}^{deg_i}\big(
      X^D
    \big)
  \Big\}
  \,.
\]


\begin{imagefromfile}

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Remarkably, such higher flux densities "automatically" appear in higher dimensional [[supergravity]], namely as partial "[[superpartners]]" of the [[gravitino]]-field. In particular in [[D=10 supergravity]] and [[D=11 supergravity]] these higher flux densities are known under the (now) fairly standard symbols shown on the right, along with the standard name of the correspoding [[singular branes]] (the "higher-dimensional monopoles").

* [[D=10 supergravity]]: [[B-field]]$\leftrightarrow$[[NS5-brane]]/[[F1-brane]] and [[RR-field]]$\leftrightarrow$[[D-branes]]

* [[D=11 supergravity]]: [[C-field]]$\leftrightarrow$[[M5-brane]]/[[M2-brane]].

(cf. [Blumenhagen, Lรผst & Theisen 2013, ยง18.5, Table 18.3](#BlumenhagenLรผstTheisen13))

Historically, the [[D-branes]] in [[D=10 supergravity]] were first identified as such &lbrack;[Polchinski 1995, cf. (14)](#Polchinski95)&rbrack; in their [[singular brane]] incarnation &lbrack;[Duff & Lu 1994](#DuffLu94)&rbrack;, while their incarnation as solitonic branes (in the [above sense](#TheDistinctionBetweenSingularAndSolitonicBranes)) was considered only later in the context of the hypothesis of [[D-brane charge quantization in K-theory]] &lbrack;[Bergman, Gimon & Hoลava 1999, ยง2.2 & ยง2.3](#BergmanGimonHoลava99), building on earlier discussion by [Witten 1998, ยง4.1](#Witten98)&rbrack; to be discussed further [below](#Examples).

### Equations of motion of flux
 {#EquationsOfMotionOfFlux}

As we now turn to the [[equations of motion]] for [[flux densities]] (the analogs of [[Maxwell's equations]] for [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] flux), the key move towards identifying possible [[flux quantization laws]] ([below](#FluxQuantizationLaws)) is to arrange these equations, equivalently, as:

1. a purely *[[cochain cohomology|cohomological]]* system of [[differential equations]] known as higher *[[Bianchi identities]]*;

1. a purely *[[geometry|geometric]]* system of [[linear equations]] expressing a *[[Hodge duality|Hodge self-duality]]*.

the point being that the first item is entirely "[[algebraic topology|algebro-topological]]" ([[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]]),  while dependency on geometry,  namely on the [[spacetime]] [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|metric]]  (the [[field (physics)|field]] of [[gravity]]) is all isolated in the second item.

It turns out &lbrack;[SS23-FQ](#SS23-FQ)&rbrack; that from such *duality-symmetric laws of flux*, the [[canonical phase space]] of the [[higher gauge theory]], including the [[flux quantization|flux-quantization structure]] may be obtained straightforwardly, *without* going through the traditional and thorny route of [[BRST complex|BRST-]][[BV formalism|BV analysis]] based on an [[stationary action principle]] given by a [[Lagrangian density]]. 

\begin{imagefromfile}

        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


This move of isolating "pre-metric flux equations" supplemented by a "constitutive" duality constraint has a curious status in the  literature. On the one hand, it is elementary and immediate as an equivalent re-formulation of the usual form of (higher) Maxwell-type equations of motion,
and as such has been highlighted, in the case of electromagnetism a century ago  [Kottler (1922a)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#Kottler22a), [(1922b)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#Kottler22b), [Cartan (1924) ยง80](pre-metric+electromagnetism#Cartan24), [Dantzig (1934)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#Dantzig34)  and more recently [Hehl & Obukhov (2003)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#HehlObukhov03), [Delphenich (2005a)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#Delphenich05a), [(2005b)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#Delphenich05a) (see the comprehensive account by [Delphenich (202x)](pre-metric+electromagnetism#DelphenichBook)). While the broader community does not seem to have taken much note of "premetric electromagnetism", we may observe that just the same "pregeometric" perspective evidently underlies what string theorists call "duality-symmetric" or (for better or worse: "democratic")  formulations of supergravity fields (see Examples \ref{MotionOfSupergravityCField} and \ref{MotionOfCoupledBRRFields} below).


\begin{definition}\label{HigherMaxwellEquations}
**Higher Maxwell-type equations** (in vacuum)
on a [[tuple]] (eq:TheHigherFluxDensities) of [[flux]] [[differential forms]] $\vec F \,\equiv\, \big\{F^{(i)}\big\}_{i \in I}$ of any degree $deg_i \geq 1$ on a [[dimension of a manifold|$D$-dimensional]] [[spacetime]] $X^D$ (a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]) of any dimension $D = d+1 \geq 2$ , is:

1. any system of [[polynomial]] $\vec P(-)$ first order [[exterior derivative|exterior]]-[[differential equations]] $\mathrm{d} \vec F \,=\, \vec P\big(\vec F\big)$ (the higher [[Bianchi identities]], crucially admitting polynomial "self-sourcing" of fluxes);

1. subject to a [[linear map|linear]] $\vec \mu(-)$ [[Hodge star operator|Hodge]]-[[duality-symmetric higher gauge theory|self-duality]] relation $\star \vec F \,=\, \vec \mu\big(\vec F\big)$ (the "[[constitutive equation]]"):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-HigherMaxwellEquations.jpg",
    "width": 800,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Concretely:

* $\vec P$ is an $I$-tuple of graded-symmetric [[polynomials]] with [[rational numbers|rational]] [[coefficients]] in $I$ [[variables]] of degrees $\vec deg$,

* $\vec \mu$ is a [[linear map|linear]] [[endomorphism]] on the [[vector space]] [[linear span|spanned]] by these variables.

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The equations in Def. \ref{HigherMaxwellEquations} imply that $\vec P$ and $\vec \mu$ respect degrees is a certain evident way. Moreover, the following property of the [[Hodge star operator]] on [[Lorentzian manifolds]] (see [there](Hodge+star+operator#eq:HodgeSquareOnRiemannian)) implies further constraints on the available higher Maxwell-type equations:
\[
  \label{HodgeSquareOnLorentzianSpacetime}
  \star 
  \,
  \star
  \,
  F_{deg}
  \;\;
  =
  \;\;
  -(-1)^{deg(D-deg)}
  \,
  F_{deg}
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \text{for}
  \;
  F_{deg}
  \,\in\,
  \Omega^{deg}_{dR}(X^D)
  \,.
\]
This controls notably the existence of genuinely [[self-dual higher gauge theories]], see Ex. \ref{MotionOfSelfDualHigherGaugeFluxes} below.

\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
Not all higher gauge theories are of the higher Maxwell-form (Def. \ref{HigherMaxwellEquations}): For instance [higher Chern-Simons type theories](higher+gauge+field#OfChernSimonsType) are different.

As a consequence, given a higher gauge theory of higher Maxwell-type, its [[double dimensional reduction]] is no longer of this type, since the [[KK-monopole]]-flux appears without a Hodge duality-partner, see below (..).
\end{remark}


\begin{example}\label{MotionOfElectromagneticField}
**(Motion of the electromagnetic fluxes)**

The classical [[Maxwell equations]] expressed in terms of differential forms (see basic references [here](Maxwell's+equations#ReferencesForMaxwellEquationsViaDifferentialForms)) are as shown on the left, with their [[premetric electromagnetism|premetric]] form shown on the right (see the references [there](pre-metric+electromagnetism#ReferencesPremetricElectromagnetism)):

\end{imagefromfile}

Here the [[differential 3-form]] $J_3$ embodies the density of an [[electric current]] carrying an [[electric field]] and inducing a [[magnetic field]]. This kind of *[[background field|background]]* source term, where the source is not given by (a polynomial in) the flux densities themselves, does not fit into the Definition \ref{HigherMaxwellEquations} and shall be disregarded for the purpose of the present discussion, meaning that we focus on the special case of Maxwell's equations "in vacuum":

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-MotionOfVacuumElectromagnetism.jpg",
    "width": 430,
    "unit": "px",

    }
\end{imagefromfile}

\end{example}

It is clear that, mathematically at least, Ex. \ref{MotionOfElectromagneticField}, makes sense more generally for flux densities of any degree. In particular:

\begin{example}\label{MotionOfPureRRFields}
**(Motion of untwisted [[RR-field]] fluxes)**

The [[equations of motion]] of the [[RR-field]] fluxes in [[D=10 supergravity]] in the case of vanishing [[B-field]]-fluxes are often taken to be as follows:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-MotionOfPureRRFluxes.jpg",
    "width": 820,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

> (While we may think of $\bullet$ as ranging over all [[natural numbers]] -- which is suggestive in view of [[D-brane charge quantization in topological K-theory|Hypothesis K]] discussed below -- of course on the given spacetime manifold of dimension $D=10$ all differential forms of degree $\gt 10$ vanish identically.)

Beware, while these equations are readily written down in themselves and are now often stated in this form, it is at least subtle to see them in entirety as actually arising from [[D=10 supergravity]], since in that context the fluxes of low (co)dimensions are not genuinely present (in type IIA this concerns $F_8$ and $F_0$, $F_{10}$, the latter two, at least, belong to [[massive type IIA supergravity]]). See the discussion in ... below.
\end{example}

Notice that in type IIB, Ex. \ref{MotionOfPureRRFields} describes a flux density ($F_5$) which is Hode dual (not just to any other flux in the tuple but) to itself, $F_5 \,=\, \star\, F_5$. Generally we have:

\begin{example}\label{MotionOfSelfDualHigherGaugeFluxes}
**(Motion of self-dual higher gauge field fluxes)**

Since Def. \ref{HigherMaxwellEquations} regards *every* higher gauge theory as being "self-dual" in a sense, the [[equations of motion]] of [[flux densities]] of actual [[self-dual higher gauge fields]] -- in the strict sense that one and the same flux density form is required to be Hodge dual to itself -- are readily an example of Def. \ref{HigherMaxwellEquations}:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "GeomPhys-MotionOfSelfDualFlux.jpg",
    "width": 510,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Due to the properties of the square of the Hodge operator (eq:HodgeSquareOnLorentzianSpacetime),
this has non-trivial solutions iff the degree of the flux is odd $deg = 2k+1$ and hence iff spacetime dimension is $D=4k+2$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{example}

What is much more clear-cut than the example of fluxes in [[D=10 supergravity]] (Ex. \ref{MotionOfPureRRFields}) is the following example of fluxes in [[D=11 supergravity]], where at least on flat spacetimes there is no ambiguity in the literature:


\begin{example}\label{MotionOfSupergravityCField}
**(Motion of [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] fluxes)**

The equations of motion of the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] in [[D=11 supergravity]] (originally the "3-index A-field" due to [Cremmer, Julia & Scherk 1978](D=11+supergravity#CremmerJuliaScherk78), see also [D'Auria & Frรฉ 1982, p. 131](D=11+supergravity#DAuriaFrรฉ82); [Castellani, D'Auria & Frรฉ 1991, ยงIII.8](D=11+supergravity#CastellaniDAuriaFrรฉ91); [Miemiec & Schnakenburg 2006, p. 32](D=11+supergravity#MiemiecSchnakenburg06)) are traditionally as shown on the left here, with their equivalent "duality-symmetric" reformulation shown on the right (see the references [there](duality-symmetric+higher+gauge+theory#PremetricCFieldReferences)):

        "right": 0, 
        "left": 0
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Since this higher gauge theory is unambiguous, it is worth considering its [[double dimensional reduction]]: Considering the case that the 11-dimensional spacetime is the total space of a [[circle group|circle]]-[[principal bundle]] over a 10-dimensional base manifold $X^{10}$

\begin{tikzcd}[sep=20pt]
  S^1 
  \ar[r, hook]
  &
  X^{11}
  \ar[d]
  \\
  &
  X^{10}
\end{tikzcd}

with ([[first Chern class|first]]) [[Chern class]] represented by a [[differential 2-form]] on $X^{10}$

\[
  \label{ClosureOfFirstChernClassOnBaseSpace}
  \mathrm{d}
  \,
  F_2
  \;=\;
  0
  \,,
\]

and assuming that all flux densities are $S^1$-inavariant (hence focusing on their 0th [[Kaluza-Klein reduction|KK-modes]]) they decompose into a [[basic differential form|basic]] component (a differential form on $X^{10}$, [[pullback of differential forms|pulled back]] to $X^{11}$ ) and the [[wedge product]] of a [[basic differential form]] with the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] $\theta$ on the $S^1$-fibers:

$$
  \begin{array}{l}
    G_4
    \;=\;
    F_4 \,+\, \theta \wedge H_3
    \\
    G_7 
    \;=\;
    H_7 \,+\, \theta \wedge F_6
    \,.
  \end{array}
$$

In terms of these components, the above duality-symmetric equations of motion of the C-field read equivalently as follows &lbrack;[Mathai & Sati 2004, ยง4](duality+between+M-theory+and+type+IIA+string+theory#MathaiSati04)&rbrack;:
