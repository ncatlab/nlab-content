## Idea

A _Jordan superalgebra_ is the analog of a [[Jordan algebra]] in [[superalgebra]]/[[supergeometry]]. A Jordan superalgebra $J$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra $J = J_0 \oplus J_1$, where $J_0$ is a Jordan algebra and $J_1$ a $J_0$-bimodule with a “Lie-like” product into $J_0$.

Elements of $J$ are supercommutative, that is, $a \cdot b = (-1)^{|a|\cdot|b|} b \cdot a$, and satisfy the super Jordan identity.

## Classification

Simple Jordan superalgebras over an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic 0]] were classified by Kac ([Kac 77](#Kac77)). The only [[exceptional structure|exceptional]] finite-dimensional example is the 10-dimensional Jordan superalgebra $K_{10}$.
