## Idea

In [[computer science]], a __stream__ is the same thing as an [[infinite]] [[sequence]] in [[mathematics]]. 

## Definition

Let $A$ be a [[set]] (or [[object]] of any [[category]] $C$ where the following makes sense).  Consider the [[writer monad]] $F$ from [[Set]] (or $C$) to itself that maps $X$ to $A \times X$. The [[final coalgebra]] of $F$ is the set (or object) of __streams__ on $A$.
