## Idea

The _principle of extremal action_ in [[physics]] is a historical precursor of the modern understanding that [[trajectories]] of [[particles]] and configurations of [[field (physics)|fields]] realized in [[classical mechanics]] are characterized as being the _[[variational calculus|variational]] [[extrema]]_ or _[[critical loci]]_ of a [[nonlinear functional|functional]] on the space of all possible configurations, called the _[[action functional]]_. 
For typical examples of this principle -- some of which were known to the ancient Greeks and which were then formalized in some generality in the 18th century -- these extrema are indeed minima, as with, for instance, the propagation of a ray of light through optical media in [[optics]]. More generally one speaks of the _principle of extremal action_ or the _principle of stationary action_. But in fact mostly today one just speaks of the [[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]], which are the equations that characterize these extremal trajectories.

With the advent of [[quantum mechanics]], the _principle of extremal action_ found an explanation in more fundamental terms as the [[classical limit]] of quantum [[dynamics]]. A simple, though somewhat heuristic, way to see this is via [[path integral]] [[quantization]]: whereas propagation in [[quantum mechanics]] is given by the [[path integral]] by which _every_ trajectory $\phi$ between two prescribed configurations contributes with a [[probability amplitude]] given by the  exponentiated value $\exp(i S(\phi))$ of the [[action functional]] $S$ on this trajectory, at least under some conditions the main contribution to this integral is from trajectories close to the critical points of the action functional. 


## Examples

* [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] $\implies$ [[Einstein equation of motion]] for [[gravity]]/[[general relativity]]
