(*Disambiguation: This should not be confused with propositional extensionality in [extensional type theory](extensional+type+theory#propositional_extensionality).*)

**Propositional extensionality** holds when for any two propositions $P$ and $Q$, we have $(P=Q) \simeq (P\leftrightarrow Q)$. This can be seen as the propositional case of the [[univalence axiom]], reflecting the logical equivalence of types which are propositions as equality within the [[universe of types]].

Specializing to the case where one of the propositions is 'true', [[George Boole]] can be thought to be talking about propositional extensionality when he writes

>_If instead of the proposition, "The sun shines," we say, "It is true that the sun shines," we then speak not directly of things, but of a proposition concerning things, viz., of the proposition "The sun shines." And, therefore, the proposition in which we thus speak is a secondary one.  Every primary proposition may thus give rise to a secondary proposition, viz., to that secondary proposition which asserts its truth, or declares its falsehood._ (Boole, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, p. 53)
