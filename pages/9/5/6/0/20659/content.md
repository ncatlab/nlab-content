## Idea

In the [[ADE-classification]], the items labeled $A2$ include the following:

1. as [[finite subgroups of SO(3)]]:

   the [[cyclic group of order 3]]  

   $\mathbb{Z}/3$

1. as [[finite subgroups of SU(2)]]:

   the [[cyclic group of order 3]]  

   $\mathbb{Z}/3$

1. as [[simple Lie groups]]: the [[special unitary group]] in 3 complex dimensions

   [[SU(3)]]

1. as a [[Dynkin diagram]]/[[Dynkin quiver]]: 

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node (left) at (-.5,0) {};
  \node (right) at (.5,0) {};

  \draw[fill=black] (left) circle (.1);
  \draw[fill=black] (right) circle (.1);

  \draw (left) to (right);
\end{tikzpicture}

\linebreak
