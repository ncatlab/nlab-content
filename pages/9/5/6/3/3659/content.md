## Idea
This page is a draft, see for now

* Wikipedia on the [Osterwalder--Schrader theorem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osterwalder&#8211;Schrader_theorem)

Rough idea: The [[Wightman axioms]] describe how the algebra of observables of a quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime is generated by quantum fields. The Wightman reconstruction theorem asserts that knowing all correlation functions of all fields in the vacuum state is equivalent to knowing the quantum fields. The Osterwalder--Schrader theorem states conditions that correlation functions on Euclidean spacetime have to satisfy to be equivalent to the correlation functions of a Wightman QFT on Minkowski spacetime.

In this sense the Osterwalder--Schrader theorem states and proves conditions that assure that the Wick rotation is a well defined isomorphism of quantum field theories on Minkowski and on Euclidean spacetime.

## axioms of euclidean field theory
The axioms of euclidean field theory are the euclidean analogue of the [[Wightman axioms]] on Minkowski spacetime.
The axioms may be formulated for tempered distributions, but we follow the lines of Glimm and Jaffe and define them for $\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the space of distributions that is dual to the space of all smooth functions with compact support, $mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^d)$.
We define the generating functional on $mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^d)$
$$
S(f) := \integral e^{i \phi(f)} d\mu
$$
as the inverse Fourier transform of a Borel probability measure $d\mu$ on $mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$.

* **OS0 (analyticity)**: For every finite set of test functions $f_1, f_2,...f_n$ and complex numbers $z:= (z_1, z_2, ...z_n)$ the function
$$
        z \mapsto S(\sum_{k=1}^n z_k f_k)
$$
is entire analytic on $\mathbb{C}^n$

* **OS1 (regularity)**: For some p with $1 \le p \le 2$ and some constant c the following inequality holds for all test functions f:
$$
     | S(f) | \le exp(c \| f \|_{L_1} + \| f\|^p_{L_p})
$$ 

* **OS2 (invariance)**

* **OS2 (reflection positivity)**

* **OS2 (ergodicity)**
