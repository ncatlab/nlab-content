## Idea ##

A more general concept of [[metric space]]. 

## Definition ##

A __premetric space__ is a [[set]] $S$ with a ternary [[relation]] $(-)\sim_{(-)}(-)\colon S \times \mathbb{R}_+ \times S \to \Omega$, where $\mathbb{R}_+$ represent the positive [[real numbers]] in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\Omega$ is the set of [[truth values]]. 

## Rational premetric spaces ##

Sometimes the positive [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}_{+}$ are used instead of $\mathbb{R}_{+}$, such as in the construction of the [[Cauchy real numbers]] and the [[HoTT book real numbers]]. While these are also called "premetrics" in the literature, we shall call these **rational premetrics** and the associated spaces **rational premetric spaces**, to distinguish from the real premetrics above. 

In fact, any Archimedean [[Tarski group]] would work to define premetrics and premetric spacces.
