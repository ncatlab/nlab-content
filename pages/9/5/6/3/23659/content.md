For the family of binary relations indexed by the non-negative rational numbers defined by Fred Richman in [Real numbers and other completions](http://math.fau.edu/richman/docs/RealNums.pdf), see [[Richman premetric space]].

## Idea ##

A more general concept of [[metric space]] by Auke Booij. While Auke Booij simply called these structures "[[premetric spaces]]", there are multiple notions of premetric spaces in the mathematical literature, so we shall refer to these as Booij premetric spaces. 

## Definition ##

A __Booij premetric space__ is a [[set]] $S$ with a ternary [[relation]] $(-)\sim_{(-)}(-)\colon S \times \mathbb{Q}_+ \times S \to \Omega$, where $\mathbb{Q}_+$ represent the positive [[rational numbers]] in $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\Omega$ is the set of [[truth values]]. 

Booij premetric spaces are used as in the construction of the [[Cauchy real numbers]] and the [[HoTT book real numbers]].
