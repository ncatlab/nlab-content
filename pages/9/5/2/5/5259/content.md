## Idea

The _spectral action_ is a natural [[functional]] on the space of [[spectral triple]]s. 

Since a spectral triple encode [[Riemannian geometry]] in a generalized context of [[noncommutative geometry]] a functional on a space of spectral triples is comparable to the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional on the space of ordinary Rimennian manifolds. And indeed, on spectral triples corresponding to ordinary Riemannian geometry the spectral action reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a series of integral over higher [[curvature]] invarianrs. 


## Applications

The spectral action has been proposed as an  [[action functional]] for describing fundamental [[physics]]. See at [[higher category theory and physics]] the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+category+theory+and+physics#SpecStandModAndGravity">The standard model and gravity</a>.
