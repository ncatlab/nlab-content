commonly known as *la lettre testament* or *Galois' last letter*, since, famously,  the morning after writing it the author died in a duel.


The letter announces Galois' solution to the "solvability of equations by radicals". It is commonly cited as the first printed appearance of the term *[[group]]* in modern mathematical practice (specifically: [[permutation group|group of permutations]]).
