#Idea#

The notion of quasi-category is a [[geometric definition of higher category]] which slightly relaxes the [[Kan complex|Kan condition]] on a simplicial set.


#Definition#


A quasi-category is a [[simplicial set]] in which all _inner_ horns have fillers.



#Remarks#

* Compare with the definition of a [[Kan complex]] in which _all_ horns are required to have fillers: a quasi-category is a structure slightly weaker than a Kan complex. Indeed, while we can think of a Kan complex as an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid]] (that is an $(\infty,0)$-category), in which _all_ morphisms are [[equivalence]]s, a quasi-category is a model for an $(\infty,1)$-[[infinity comma one category|category]], in which only all $n$-morphisms for $n \geq 2$ are required to be [[equivalence]]s.
