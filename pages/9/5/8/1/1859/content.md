A **Gray-Groupoid** is a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semistrict]] [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic model]] for a [[3-groupoid]]: 

it is a [[Gray-category]] -- a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semistrict]] [[3-category]] -- in which every [[k-morphism]] is invertible.

Gray-groupoids are related to [[2-crossed complex]]es and [[2-crossed module]]s as strict [[2-groupoid]]s are related to [[crossed complex]]es.

A Gray groupoid with a single object is the [[delooping]] of a [[Gray group]].
