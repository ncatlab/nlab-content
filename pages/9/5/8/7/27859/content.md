stated seven problems in [[topos theory]], unsolved at time of writing:

#### First problem
 {#FirstProblemInToposTheory}

Concerning the existence of a [[proper class]] of quotient toposes of a [[Grothendieck topos]] (with 'quotient maps' defined to be '[[connected topos#connected_geometric_morphism|connected]] [[geometric morphism#surjections_and_embeddings|surjective geometric morphisms]]').

Solution for the case of [[Boolean toposes]]:

* [[Ryuya Hora]]: *Internal Parameterization of Hyperconnected Quotients* &lbrack;[arXiv:2302.06851](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06851)&rbrack;

A special example in the non-Boolean case:

* [[Ryuya Hora]], Yuhi Kamio: _Quotient toposes of discrete dynamical systems_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2310.02647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02647)&rbrack;

Full solution:

* Yuhi Kamio, [[Ryuya Hora]], _A solution to the first Lawvere's problem A Grothendieck topos that has a proper class many quotient topoi_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2407.17105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17105)&rbrack;

#### Third problem
  {#ThirdProblemInToposTheory}

The syntactic effects of the [[co-Heyting boundary|boundary operator]] $\partial$ on general [[geometric theory|geometric theories]] $\mathbb{T}$ as well as its semantic effects on [[model|models]] of [[theory of presheaf type|theories $\mathbb{T}$ of presheaf type]] are described in section 10.2 of [[Olivia Caramello|Olivia Caramello's]] book "Theories, Sites, Toposes" (CUP 2018, p.326f). This leaves open the "semantics" for more general theories.


#### Fourth problem
  {#FourthProblemInToposTheory}

To calculate the [[Aufhebung]] of the [[adjoint triple|opposition]] between [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]] and [[simplicial coskeleton|coskeleta]] in the category of [[symmetric simplicial sets]] (the [[category of presheaves]] on the category of [[inhabited set|non-empty]] [[finite sets]]).

* [[Ryuya Hora]], Yuki Maehara: _Lawvere's fourth open problem: Levels in the topos of symmetric simplicial sets_ &lbrack;[arXiv:2503.03439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03439)&rbrack;


#### Seventh problem
 {#SeventhProblemInToposTheory}

Problem 7, "The algebra of time", concerns the characterization of _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_
