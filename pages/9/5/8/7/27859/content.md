The history of mathematics, especially through the lenses of its popularisation, has idolised the relevance of several important lists of open problems, which have guided the developments of large fields of mathematics. This has happened, just to make an example, in the case of Hilbert's list of problems, to several open problems in number theory, and to the Langlands conjectures in algebraic geometry.

Currently in topos theory there is no consensus among researchers around such a list of open problems that should be supposed to guide the research in the field.

This page is to record the reference

which is a list of open problems that Lawvere presented  "For [[Martin Hyland]] and [[Peter Johnstone]] in honor of their sixtieth birthdays"

The document states seven problems in [[topos theory]], unsolved at time of writing.

## Statement

#### First problem
 {#FirstProblemInToposTheory}

Concerning the existence of a [[proper class]] of quotient toposes of a [[Grothendieck topos]] (with 'quotient maps' defined to be '[[connected topos#connected_geometric_morphism|connected]] [[geometric morphism#surjections_and_embeddings|surjective geometric morphisms]]').

Solution for the case of [[Boolean toposes]]: [Hora 2023](#Hora23)

A special example in the non-Boolean case: [Hora & Kamio 2024a](#HoraKamio24a)

Full solution: [Kamio & Hora 2024b](#KamioHora24b)


#### Third problem
  {#ThirdProblemInToposTheory}

The syntactic effects of the [[co-Heyting boundary|boundary operator]] $\partial$ on [[geometric theory|geometric theories]] $\mathbb{T}$ as well as its semantic effects on its [[model|models]] are described in section 10.2 of [Caramello 2018](#Caramello18).


#### Fourth problem
  {#FourthProblemInToposTheory}

To calculate the [[Aufhebung]] of the [[adjoint triple|opposition]] between [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]] and [[simplicial coskeleton|coskeleta]] in the category of [[symmetric simplicial sets]] (the [[category of presheaves]] on the category of [[inhabited set|non-empty]] [[finite sets]]).


The solution by [Hora & Maehara 2025](#Hora25) as well as the remarks concerning [[cyclic sets]] by [Kennett, Riehl, Roy & Zaks 2011](#KRRZ11) suggests the following revised problem 4':

Is the [[Aufhebung|Aufhebungs]] relation of [[skew-simplicial set|skew-simplicial sets]] more generally identical to the relation for [[SSet]]?

Or even to consider this question for [[crossed group|crossed groups]] relative to [[Eilenberg-Zilber category|Eilenberg-Zilber categories]] or [[generalized Reedy category|generalized Reedy categories]].

#### Seventh problem
 {#SeventhProblemInToposTheory}

Problem 7, "The algebra of time", concerns the characterization of _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_
