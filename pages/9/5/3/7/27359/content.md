## Idea

A [[ring]] equipped with an [[apartness relation]] such that all ring operations are [[strongly extensional]] in that they reflect the apartness relation. 

In [[classical mathematics]], every [[apartness relation]] is logically equivalent to the [[negation]] of an [[equivalence relation]], so apartness rings are equivalent to [[rings]] with an equivalence relation which are [[ring setoids]] with respect to the equivalence relation. But in [[constructive mathematics]], not every [[apartness relation]] is logically equivalent to the [[negation]] of an [[equivalence relation]]; hence the concept of a *ring with apartness* or an *apartness ring*. 

## Definition

A [[ring]] $R$ is an **apartness ring** or a **ring with apartness** if it comes with an [[apartness relation]] $a \# b$ such that

* for all $a, b, c, d \in R$, $a + b \# c + d$ implies that $a \# c$ or $b \# d$

* for all $a, b \in R$, $-a \# -b$ implies that $a \# b$

* for all $a, b, c, d \in R$, $a \cdot b \# c \cdot d$ implies that $a \# c$ or $b \# d$

An apartness ring $R$ where the apartness relation is a [[tight apartness relation]] is called a *[[tight apartness ring]]*. 

## Examples

* Every [[local ring]] is an apartness ring where the apartness relation $x \# y$ is given by invertibility of $y - x$. 

* Every [[approximate integral domain]] is an apartness ring where the apartness relation $x \# y$ is given by [[cancellative element|cancellativity]] of $y - x$. 

* Every [[seminorm|semi]][[normed ring]] is an apartness ring where the apartness relation $x \# y$ is given by $0 \lt \vert y - x \vert$. 

* Every [[strictly weakly ordered ring]] is an apartness ring where the apartness relation $x \# y$ is given by the relation $(x \lt y) \vee (y \lt x)$. In the presence of [[excluded middle]], strictly weakly ordered rings are [[totally preordered rings]] where $x \lt y$ is given by the [[negation]] of the [[total preorder]] $y \leq x$.
