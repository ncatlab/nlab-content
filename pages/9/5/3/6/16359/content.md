## In solid state physics

In [[physics]], _solidity_ of [[matter]] (the subject of [[solid state physics]]) is fundamentally due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] whose induced [[degeneracy pressure]] prevents collections of [[fermions]] (such as [[electrons]] and [[quarks]] which consitute [[atoms]]) from collapsing to a [[condensate]].
