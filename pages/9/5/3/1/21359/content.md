## Definition

A [[locale]] $L$ is __connected__ if $1\ne0$ and $1=A\cup B$
for disjoint opens $A$ and $B$ implies $A=0$ or $B=0$.

A [[locale]] $L$ is __locally connected__ if its connected opens
form a [[base]] (any open is a [[supremum]] of connected opens).

## Properties

For a locally connected locale one can define its set of connected components.

See [[cosheaf of connected components]] for a parametrized version of this construction.
