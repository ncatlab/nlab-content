## Idea

A property of [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[local ring|local]] [[commutative rings]] to be Cohen-Macaulay is a weak version of a smoothness condition. 

## Definition

A local [[commutative ring]] is Cohen-Macaulay iff it is a [[Cohen-Macaulay module]] as a module on itself. 

A variety is Cohen-Macaulay if for all points $x$ the corresponding local ring is Cohen-Macauley, that is, its Krull dimension is equal to its depth. 

## Relation to other classes

Every [[regular local ring]] is Cohen-Macauley and, more generally, every [[complete intersection ring]] $\mathcal{O}_x$ is Cohen-Macauley.
