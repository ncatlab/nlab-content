A **pseudotopological space** or **Choquet space** is a [[set]] $S$ together with a [[relation]] $\to$ from $\mathcal{F}S$ to $S$, where $\mathcal{F}S$ is the set of [[filter]]s on $S$; if $F \to x$, we say that $F$ __converges__ to $x$.  This must satisfy some axioms:
1. Centred: The principal ultrafilter $F_x = \{ A \;|\; x \in A \}$ at $x$ converges to $x$;
1. Isotone: If $F \subseteq G$ and $F \to x$, then $G \to x$;
1. Filtered: If $F \to x$ and $G \to x$, then $F \cap G \to x$.
1. Star property: If $F$ is a [[filter]] such that for every proper filter $G \supseteq F$ there exists a proper filter $H \supseteq G$ with $H \to x$, then $F \to x$.

It follows that $F \to x$ if and only if every [[ultrafilter]] refining $F$ converges to $x$ (assuming the [[axiom of choice]], or more precisely the [[ultrafilter theorem]]).  Thus a pseudotopology consists precisely of a convergence relation between ultrafilters and points satisfying the single axiom that $F_x$ converges to $x$, for every $x$.

A [[subsequential space]] is a pseudotopological space that may be defined using only [[sequence]]s instead of arbitrary nets/filters.

A filter $F$ __clusters__ at a point $x$ if there exists a proper filter $G$ such that $F \subseteq G$ and $G \to x$.

The definition can also be phrased in terms of [[net]]s; a net $\nu$ converges to $x$ if and only if its eventuality filter converges to $x$.

The morphisms of convergence spaces are the continuous functions; a function $f$ between pseudotopological spaces is __continuous__ if $F \to x$ implies that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the filterbase $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$.  In this way, pseudotopological spaces form a [[category]] $PsTop$.

## Properties ##

The [[topological space]]s can be characterized as the pseudotopological ones in which the convergence satisfies a certain "associativity" condition.  In this way one can think of a topological space as a "multicategory" parametrized by ultrafilters.  In particular, note that a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] pseudotopological space is defined by a single function $\mathcal{U}S \to S$, where $\mathcal{U}S$ is the set of ultrafilters on $S$, such that the composite $S \to \mathcal{U}S \to S$ is the identity.  That is, it is an [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] for the [[pointed endofunctor]] $\mathcal{U}$.  The compact Hausdorff _topological_ spaces are precisely the algebras for $\mathcal{U}$ considered as a [[monad]].
