A **pseudotopological space** or **Choquet space** is a [[convergence space]] in which

* if $F$ is a [[filter]] such that for every filter $G \supseteq F$ there exists a filter $H \supseteq G$ with $H \to x$, then $F \to x$.

In a pseudotopological space, we have $F\to x$ if and only if every [[ultrafilter]] refining $F$ converges to $x$ (assuming the [[axiom of choice]], or more precisely the [[ultrafilter theorem]]).  Thus a pseudotopology consists precisely of a convergence relation between ultrafilters and points satisfying the single axiom that $F_x$ converges to $x$, for every $x$.

A [[subsequential space]] is a pseudotopological space that may be defined using only [[sequence]]s instead of arbitrary nets/filters.
