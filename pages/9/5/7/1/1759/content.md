## 2009-07-09

* [[Zoran Skoda]] 

  * I STRONGLY disagree with creation of spurios PLURAL items when they are of NO use. Namely like Eric just created new version of [[bialgebra cocycle]] to say that it redirects [[bialgebra cocycles]], while it is simpler and better from memory point of view to write [[bialgebra cocycle]]s. Why having whole page archived and one more page to browse in history just to distiguish if s is before or after the brackets ?? Dear Eric we have thousands of items to enter and there will be thousands of new pages in future and why to increase entropy and spend yuor valuable time on this -- please take some book and help us entering something NEW and not messing with plurals and creating new versions for nothing. I have hard time browsing history when something is messed up and if I am going to spend it on such a nonsense than I will leave the idea to enter new items myself.  

    * [[Eric]]: Hi Zoran. By adding a redirect for plurals, we are not creating spurious pages (but we are creating spurious revisions, but I don't see that as a meaningful issue). In fact, my hope is that everyone will stop writing things like <nowiki>[[page]]s</nowiki> in favor of <nowiki>[[pages]]</nowiki> at which point I could stop correcting the links. Please see [[redirect]] for more information. Redirects are a very nice new feature of the nLab (partially motivated by your suggestions wrt symbolic links) and I hope they become a natural part of any contributors arsenal. PS: It is ironic that you complain about creating additional revisions when you just created a THIRD revision by changing my redirect BACK (???). PPS: A good place to discuss this and any other administrative issues is on the [n-forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/). That is a good place for such discussions and once a decision has been made about any issue, the conclusion will be placed on the brand new [nLab meta](http://ncatlab.org/nlabmeta/show/HomePage) site. We're working on decision making processes now and any feedback is more than welcome.

  * created [[bialgebra cocycle]], [[Drinfel'd twist]]

  * by the way how does one download the source of a previous version ? I sometimes create a page and then there are changes after and I want to have my file for other purposes with what I wrote and I do not know how to access it. 

* [[John Baez|John]] 

  * I did some work on the [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]], and proposed some new guidelines for how it should look. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * am working at [[Cech cohomology]] on the section "Abelian Cech cohomology" where my aim is to spell out a derivation of the standard Cech double complex from starting with the general definition of cohomology for the case that the coefficient object is in the image of the Dold-Kan map from chain complexes of sheaves to simplicial sheaves -- I am not really satisfied, but this is how far I got -- check critically


## 2009-07-08

* [[Urs Schreiber]]:
 
  * added to [[nerve]] an "Idea" section and a further "examples"-section on nerves for chain complexes and the relation to the Dold-Kan correspondence

  * after a bit of work and with a bit of luck, I found the old reference by Kan where the description of the Dold-Kan correspondence is given in terms of nerves -- this is the nice way to do it -- added that reference to the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

    * that reminds me that it would be nice if we eventually had an entry on that verey general nonsense behind nerves (or do we already have that somewhere?)

  * by coincidence I came across the old entry [[crossed module]] and noticed that there were meanwhile plenty of links to add to it -- so I did

  * added two further references, by Birgit Richter, on the ($\infty$-)monoidal structure of the Dold-Kan correspondence  to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * added a small section on and a link to [[matching family]] at [[sheafification]]

  * reorganized [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] in an attempt to make the material more systematic -- then I started adding a detailed def/lemma/theorem/proof list of the classical statement, but didn't get very far yet

  * made a remark at [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]]

  * pasted a blog comment by [[David Ben-Zvi]] into [[n-categorical physics]]

*  [[Zoran ?koda]]: created [[essential image]], added n-category generalization to [[replete subcategory]], additions to [[image]], [[model structure on chain complexes]], remark due Leinster to [[Gray-category]]; created [[matching family]] following mainly conventions in MacLane-Moerdijk. This last item surely overlaps with [[sheafification]] but the approach and exposition is rather different; created micro-entry [[maximal sieve]].  

## 2009-07-07

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Gave Tim a link at [[category theory]].
   *  Started [[suspension]] to fill links.  (We already have [[reduced suspension]].  There\'s also a suspension defined at [[delooping]] which doesn\'t seem to be quite the same; what\'s the connection?)

      * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: when passing from topological spaces to spectra, suspension of spaces becomes the suspension mentioned at delooping: that in a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], I'd say

* [[David Corfield|David]]

  * added to [[co-H-space]]. It's not looking very much like a dual version of [[H-space]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[Cech cover]] and [[Cech model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

    * in that context also rewrote and expanded the introduction at [[hypercover]] and included corresponding links at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

  * I notice that [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] is a renamed version of the original Sandbox(!). (As you can see by clicking on its "history" link. But also the current [[Sandbox]]'s very first link claims to lead to the historical Sandbox, but takes on to the Sandbox poage with title "Timeline of category theory-...") I guess that's not intended. 

    *  This came about because [[Rafael Borowiecki]] created the [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|Timeline]] by moving the [[Sandbox]] instead of as a new page.  So I was faced with the choice to move it back and then create Rafael\'s page properly or to just recreate the Sandbox instead.  So I recreated the Sandbox but then put a note at the top in case anybody wants to see the history of that page, which is now at the [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|Timeline]].  (But now that it\'s been more than half an hour, I can remove that note; anyone looking through the history will still see it.)  ---Toby

  * tried to improve the exposition at [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]]. More to be done eventually, though.

* [[Eric]]

  * Reminds Urs that he no longer needs to type <nowiki>[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]</nowiki> because there is now a redirect from [[Urs]] to [[Urs Schreiber]]., i.e. the link <nowiki>[[Urs]]</nowiki> points to [[Urs]]. Try it! :)

  * Along similar lines, after seeing <nowiki>[[internalization|internal to]]</nowiki> about a million times, I just added a redirect so that typing <nowiki>[[internal to]]</nowiki> gets redirected automatically to [[internal to]]. Try it! :)


## 2009-07-06

* [[Urs]]

  * replied to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] at [[cogroup]] (yes, that wasn't so good) and to [[David Roberts|David R.]] at [[principal infinity-bundle]] (yes, that was a typo)

* [[Toby Bartels]]:

  * I would like to suggest that the appearance of links to nonexistent pages is a *feature* that we should not break.  Thus we should not create blank pages (or pages that are blank except for redirects) but instead create pages only when we have something to put there.  Conversely, we shouldn\'t change links to go to redirected forms (as at [[geometric infinity-function theory]] currently) unless the redirects have actually been created.  If this means that we have things like `[[∞-foo|infinity-foo]]` (when nobody has written about $\infty$-foos yet), then we\'re no worse off than before we had redirects, and the appearance of links to nonexistent pages still tells us something.  (Note: there is some related discussion now hidden under July 3.)

    * [[Eric]]: I agree that appearance of links to nonexistent pages is a **feature** that should not be broken. Currently, one of my self-assigned projects (a.k.a. a labor of love) is to pick a page and systematically "clean it". The last major cleaning was [[geometric ∞-function theory]]. I hope that for the most part (with some minor exceptions) most everyone would agree that it looks a lot better now. The issue that brought up your comment, however, came about as a result of me "cleaning" [[strict ∞-category]]. Part of my system for cleaning pages involves changing things like <nowiki>[[category|categories]]</nowiki> to simply <nowiki>[[categories]]</nowiki> and adding a redirect from [[categories]] to [[category]]. If I do this enough, then most n-Lab pages will have available redirects for plural forms of nouns. In fact, I would encourage everyone to stop including things like <nowiki>[[singular page name|plural page name]]</nowiki> and simply use the plural form <nowiki>[[plural page name]]</nowiki>. Then either leave the nonexistent link there for someone to add the redirect or add the [[redirect]] yourself. What happened on [[strict ∞-category]] was that there was a link <nowiki>[[exchange law|exchange laws]]</nowiki>. My "system" suggests that I change that to <nowiki>[[exchange laws]]</nowiki> and add a redirect from [[exchange laws]] to [[exchange law]]. In this rare case, [[exchange law]] did not exist yet, so I couldn't add a redirect without creating a blank page for [[exchange law]]. In this rare case, given that I am trying to systematically "clean" pages, I thought it was acceptable to break the rule about nonexistent pages. I still think it is justified as long as it doesn't become a habit, which I'm pretty sure it won't be.

  * A question at [[cogroup]] about what we really want there.  (Surely more than just the empty set?)

    * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: we want to say that pointed _spheres_ are co-groups, so that maps out of them, called homotopy groups, are, well, groups. Supposed to be dual to the statement that mapping _into_ a group coefficient object gives [[cohomology group]]s

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] 

  * added to [[principal bundle]] a long detailed section called "the $G$-action from the homotopy pullback" -- this may look like weird overkill, but the point is that this serves as a warmup for an analogous discussion at [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * rediscovered that we had an entry [[Cech methods]] and added lots of links to that

  * provided explicit details at [[Cech cohomology]] for the general (nonabelian) case in low degree

* [[Zoran ?koda]]: created [[small fibration]], added more general discussion on [[endomorphism monoids]]. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] created [[Cech cohomology]]

* [[David Corfield|David]]

  * more suggestions than changes, but it would be good to have entries for [[cogroup]] and [[co-H-space]]. Could [[homotopy group]] and [[cohomology group]] be made to resemble each other more? I.e., must the former be restricted to $n$-spheres as domain? Hmm, is something suboptimal about H-group and H-cogroup, whereas H-space and co-H-space? Perhaps 'co' and 'H' commute.

    * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: it would in principle be good to have expositions at [[cohomology]], [[cohomology group]] and [[homotopy]], [[homotopy group]] be more symmetric -- we just have to beware that we'd be going into untrodden territory and should indicate accordingly: while generalized cohomologies of all sorts are becoming familiar, I can't recall having seen mentioned the corresponding dual notion of generalized homotopy anywhere but in our discussion -- so we should maybe tag the corresponding discussion, if we implrement it, with a box saying "this is research material" or the like -- but I would enjoy it if we did so

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]]

    * added a discussion of this at [[delooping]], a brief reference to it at [[quotient object]] and a link to it in the fourth $\inft$-Giraud-axiom at [[(infinity,1)-topos]]


## 2009-07-05

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Mentioned [[endomorphism monoids]] too.
   *  Tried to give Tim some comfort at [[pseudofunctor]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * added a tiny bit of discussion to [[principal infinity-bundle]] about how the homotopy pullback definition gives the $G$-action and vice versa. But need to say more here.

    * By the way has anyone seen [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]? I know that he has thought about this, it's related to his [[michaelshulman:exactness hypothesis|exactness hypothesis]].


## 2009-07-04

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Mentioned [[automorphism groups]].

*  [[Tim]]: I have asked a silly question at [[pseudofunctor]], but would appreciate an answer. Can I make a plea to someone to provide a more detailed treatment of the Grothendieck construction as well. (I mean the one which is related to the pseudocolimit. At least a general reference to that should be in the entry.)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Put some stuff at [[equality]], but there is much more that could and should be said there.
   *  Added some pretty broad examples to [[evil]].

*  [[Tim]]: I have added new references to [[distributor]] and [[Grothendieck fibration]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Added a bit to the scandalously short page [[isomorphism]].


## 2009-07-03

*  [[Eric Forgy]] created [[exchange law]] blank (perhaps by accident?) and [[Toby Bartels]] wrote a very brief stub there.
   *  _Eric_: This was not an accident. I was cleaning some pages and wanted a redirect for [[exchange laws]], but [[exchange law]] did not exist yet, so I created it so I could insert a redirect assuming (correctly) that someone would fill in some content.
   *  _Toby_:  I wouldn\'t agree with your assumption.  What I wrote there is not very useful; if I\'d waited to write it by choice rather than by necessity, then I would have written rather more.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * edited and expanded the link list at [[generalized smooth space]]

  * created [[smooth infinity-stack]] -- took the liberty of declaring this to be the term for "$\infty$-stacks on CartesianSpaces" 

    * see the example there to see the relevance of this, with an eye towards the discussion at [[principal 2-bundle]] and [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * created [[smooth space]] -- took the liberty of declaring this to be the term for "sheaves on Diff" = "sheaves on CartesianSpaces". 

    * this way a "diffeological space" is precisely a "concrete smooth space" and I 

      * edited [[diffeological space]]

      * and created [[concrete sheaf]] (but [[concrete site]] still missing, and also maybe not the best definition at [[concrete sheaf]] yet)
  
      to make this statement.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Created [[Cauchy sequence]] and [[complete space]], including brief references at the end of each to the relationship with [[Cauchy complete categories]].


## 2009-07-02

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * started a section "concrete realizations" at [[principal infinity-bundle]]. So far I recall the old result by Quillen on certain "1-categorica topological bundles" and their $\infty$-action groupoids. Then I start making some remarks on Jardine's approach using what he calls "diagrams" and have a remark on how that compares to the Bartels-Bakovi&cacute;-etc-style. This requires eventually much more discussion, but I have to call it quits for today. 

    But the point is that Jardine works in the "petit topos" perspective where all bundles live over the fixed site. So the terminal object in his setup is not the point, but the underlying space over which one works. This means that the simple picture of a principal $\infty$-bundle as the homotopy pullback of the point no longer works and is the reason why he introduces the yoga of what he calls "diagrams".

    On the other hand, when one works with simplicial sheaves in the context of a "gros topos" such as sheaves on $Diff$ or on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ or equivalent, then the simple conceptual picture remains valid. 

    Notice that placing oneself into the context of $n$-groupoids internal to diffeological spaces or the like is doing precissely this: working with simplicial sheaves on $Diff$.

    Evidently i shouldn't be discussing this here but in some entry. But it's time for me to go to bed now.


* [[Zoran ?koda]] created [[grouplike element]]. It contains few words on Amitsur complex for a coring with a (semi-)grouplike. The aim is to soon (using the setup) introduce entries for connections for corings; and then correpsondence between falt connections and descent data in the comonadic and coring setups (after Menini et al; all coming back to the example which is the correspondence between 1-order costratifications and flat connections in the crystalline setup due Grothendieck). 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * started adding the discussion of the model given by (pre)sheaves with values in _simplicial groupoids_ to [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] (contained in a new big diagram containing all Quillen equivalent models for $\infty$-sheaves)

    * in that context created [[model structure on presheaves of simplicial groupoids]]


* [[Zoran ?koda]] created [[coseparable coring]],[[Sweedler coring]], [[two dimensional sheaf theory]]; expanded [[stratifold]] (which was empty, but existing!), added a reference to [[fibration in a 2-category]] and somewhere else. I think that in K-theory delooping has a bit different multiple meanings which are related but are more procedures making from something what can not be delooped strictly in the sense of [[delooping]] to the delooping of something what is the best approximation of deloopable; there are procedures due to Quillen, Waldhausen, Karoubi etc. 

  * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: the entry on [[two dimensional sheaf theory]] is motivated from some behind-the-scenes discussion Zoran and I are having -- Zoran rightly points out that the present characterization of [[derived stack]] may be wanting, as strictly speaking saying "derived stack" should be related to but not be regarded as equivalent to "higher stack on higher categorical site" -- what we really need eventually is more details on the To&#235;n-Vezzosi [work](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0579/) on higher topos theory in the context of SSet-enriched categories, 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] 

  * replied at [[delooping]]


* _[[Eric]]_: Added a redirect for [[Urs]] so that he no longer has to type <nowiki>[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]</nowiki> and can simply type <nowiki>[[Urs]]</nowiki> and will be redirected to the correct page.

## 2009-07-01

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * proudly presenting what is now the widest (horizontally speaking) $n$Lab entry as yet: at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] I added a section "Map" where I draw a big diagram that indicates at least part of the collection of model structures, their interrelation, definition and authors

    *  Yeah, I was thinking of reworking that map to run vertically ....  ---Toby

    *  Would that really be better, though? Optimally, eventually we'd produce a LaTeXed pdf diagram. Here and elsewhere. That, however, inhibits joint editing a bit. ---Urs


  * replied at [[delooping]], at [[group]], added a bit at [[Notation]]

  * moved the key statement of [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s remark to the very beginning of [[group]] 


*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  [[Andrew Stacey]] may be interested to see how I\'ve changed the formatting of the goal box at [[Froelicher space]].
   *  Incorporated Zoran\'s new references at [[principal 2-bundle]] into the text.
   *  Added a note at [[group]] how $Grp$ is a full sub-$2$-category of $Grpd_*$ (even though not of $Grpd$).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * expanded at [[group]] on the statement that "a group is a groupoid with a single object"

  * added to [[loop space object]] the true definition, added also an "idea" section, links to related entries and an introductory blurb to the original material

  * created [[delooping]] for the matter discussed by [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] and [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] at [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]

  * added Jardine-Luo reference to [[principal 2-bundle]] and [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * added to [[Froelicher space]] an "Idea" and a "Reference" section, prompoted by the blog entry [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/laubinger_on_lie_algebras_for.html)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  I archived the [[2009 June changes]] by the sneaky method of changing this page\'s name, copying the header and footer text (with appropriate changes) from the previous archive, and then creating this page anew.  Maybe that will keep us from testing Instiki\'s tolerance for pages with thousands of edits in their history.  (^_^)
   *  I\'ve completed migrating all old redirect pages to history pages; all links within the body of the Lab should now take you immediately to the target page.  (There are a few victims of a bug, but I\'ll straighten that out with Jacques.)  I have [more comments](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=39) on the Forum.
