## Idea


The **colored Jones polynomial** of a [[knot]] or [[link]] is a generalization of the [[Jones polynomial]]. The latter may be seen as 'colored' by the defining 2-dimensional [[complex number|complex]] [[linear representation]] of [[SU(2)]], where the $N$-colored Jones polynomial $J_N(K, q)$ involves instead the $N$-dimensional [[irreducible representation]].
