#Definition#

A **retraction** of a [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ is a one-sided inverse: a [[morphism]] $\rho : B \to A$ such that
$$
  A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \stackrel{\rho}{\to} A
$$
equals the [[identity morphism]] on $A$.

In this case, $f$ may also be called a [[section]] of $\rho$, $A$ may be called a [[retract]] of $B$, and the entire situation is said to split the [[idempotent]]
$$
  B \stackrel{\rho}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B
.$$

A **[[split monomorphism]]** is a morphism that *has* a retraction; a **[[split epimorphism]]** is a morphism that *is* a retraction.
