## Eleven-dimensional supergravity

On [[11-dimensional supergravity]]

On classification of [[supersymmetry]]-[[super Lie algebras]]:

* {#Nahm78} [[Werner Nahm]], _[[Supersymmetries and their Representations]]_, Nucl.Phys. B135 (1978) 149 ([spire:120988](https://inspirehep.net/record/120988), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(78)90218-3">doi:10.1016/0550-3213(78)90218-3</a>)


(...)

On the [[KK-monopole]]:

* {#HanKoh85} Seung Kee Han, I. G. Koh, _$N = 4$ Remaining Supersymmetry in Kaluza-Klein Monopole Background in D=11 Supergravity Theory_, Phys.Rev. D31 (1985) 2503, in [[Michael Duff]] (ed.), _[[The World in Eleven Dimensions]]_ 57-60 ([doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.31.2503](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.31.2503), [spire:204521](http://inspirehep.net/record/204521))


## The eleven-dimensional supermembrane

On the [[M2-brane]]

## The eleven-dimensional superfivebrane

On the [[M5-brane]]

## $M$-theory (before $M$-theory was cool)

on [[M-theory]]

## Intersecting branes and black holes

On [[black branes]], [[BPS-states]] of intersecting M-branes, 

* [[Arkady Tseytlin]], _Harmonic superpositions of M-branes_, Nucl.Phys.B475:149-163,1996 ([arXiv:hep-th/9604035](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9604035))

as well as [[black holes in string theory]] and [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]

## $M$-theory and duality

On [[duality in string theory]], mostly [[S-duality]] and [[dual heterotic string theory]], ending with [[AdS-CFT]]

On whether "M" is really for "[[membrane]]" after all:

> In other words, perhaps $D = 11$ supergravity together with [[M-brane|its BPS configurations]]: [[M-wave|plane wave]], [[M2-brane|membrane]], [[M5-brane|fivebrane]], [[KK monopole]] and the $D = 11$ embedding of the Type II [[D8-brane|eight brane]] are are all there is to $M$-theory and that we need look no further for new degrees of freedom. (p. 329)

Concluding with:

> future historians may judge the period 1984-95 as a time when theorists were like boys playing by the sea shore, and diverting themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of perturbative ten-dimensiorial superstrings while the great ocean of non-perturbative eleven-dimensional M-theory lay all undiscovered before them. (p.330)

Compare to the situation 20 years later as in 

* [[Greg Moore]], _[[Physical Mathematics and the Future]]_, talk at [Strings 2014](http://physics.princeton.edu/strings2014/)

with its section 12: "Keep true to the dreams of thy youth: M-theory"
