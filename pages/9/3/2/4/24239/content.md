_Higher-Dimensional Types in the Mechanization of Homotopy Theory_, [[Kuen-Bang Hou (Favonia)]], Ph. D. Thesis 2017, [pdf](https://favonia.org/files/thesis.pdf)

## Abstract
Mechanized reasoning has proved effective in avoiding serious mistakes
in software and hardware, and yet remains unpopular in the practice of mathematics. My thesis is aimed at making mechanization easier so that more
mathematicians can benefit from this technology. Particularly, I experimented
with higher-dimensional types, an extension of ordinary types with a hierarchy of stacked relations, and managed to mechanize many important results
from classical homotopy theory in the proof assistant Agda. My work thus
suggests higher-dimensional types may help mechanize mathematical concepts.
