## Idea

_Representation theory_ is concerned with the study of [[algebra|algebraic]] [[structures]] via their [[representations]], This concerns notably [[groups]], directly or in their incarnation as [[group algebras]], [[Hopf algebras]] or [[Lie algebras]], and usually concerns [[linear algebra|linear]] [[representations]], hence [[modules]] of these structures. But more generally representation theory also studies [[representations]]/[[modules]]/[[actions]] of generalizations of such structures, such as [[coalgebras]] via their [[comodules]] etc.

See also at _[[geometric representation theory]]_.

## In homotopy type theory
 {#InHomotopyTypeTheory}

The fundamental concepts of representation theory have a particular natural formulation in  [[homotopy theory]] and in fact in [[homotopy type theory]], which also  refines it from the study of [[representations]] of [[groups]] to that of     [[∞-representations]] of [[∞-groups]]. This includes both [[discrete ∞-groups]] as well as [[geometric homotopy types]] such as [[smooth ∞-groups]], the higher analog of [[Lie groups]].

The key observation to this translation is that 

1. an [[∞-group]] $G$ is equivalently given by its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ regarded with its canonical [[pointed object|point]] (see at [[looping and delooping]]), hence the universal $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] 

   $$
     \array{
        G &\longrightarrow& \ast
        \\
        && \downarrow
        \\
        && \mathbf{B}G
     }
   $$

1. an [[∞-action]] $\rho$ of $G$ on any [[geometric homotopy type]] $V$ is equivalently given by a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of the form

   $$
     \array{
        V &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& V//_\rho G
        \\
        && \downarrow
        \\
        && \mathbf{B}G
     }
     \,,
   $$

   hence by a $V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] over $\mathbf{B}G$ which is the $\rho$-[[associated ∞-bundle]] to the universal $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] (see at _[[∞-action]]_ for more on this).

Under this identification, the representation theory of $G$ is equivalently 

* the [[homotopy theory]] in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] over $\mathbf{B}G$;

* the [[homotopy type theory]] in the [[context]] of/[[dependent type theory|dependent on]] $\mathbf{B}G$. 

More in detail, this yields the following identifications:
