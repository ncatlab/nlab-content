(It does _not_ refer to the idea of chain complexes of groups, i.e., [[chain complexes]] in the (more or less) usual sense.)

##Idea

A _complex of groups_ is a [[diagram]] of [[groups]], [[homomorphisms]] and [[conjugations]], corresponding, abstractly, to the system of inclusions of the [[stabiliser]] subgroups of an [[action]] of a group on a [[simplicial cell complex]] or equivalently on a [[small category without loops]]. If the complex is 1-dimensional one obtains a [[graph of groups]] - note however, the category of 1-complexes of groups is not equivalent as a category to the category of graphs of groups (see [[A. Thomas]] Proposition 2.1).

##Definition

We will initially give the definition in its 'bare hands' form. Here $K$ is a [[simplicial complex]]

 A _complex of groups_, $G(K)$, on $K$ is specified by the data, $(\{G_\sigma\}, \{\psi_a\}, \{g_{a, b}\})$
given by

* a group, $G_{\sigma}$, for each simplex, $\sigma$, of $K$; 

* an injective homomorphism,

$$\psi_a :G_{i (a)} \rightarrow G_{t(a)},$$

for each edge, $a \in E_K$, of the barycentric subdivision of $K$;

* for each pair of composable edges, $a$ and $b$, in $E_K$, an element
  $g_{a, b} \in G_{t(a)}$ is given such that

$$g^{- 1}_{a, b} \psi_{ba} (_-) g_{a, b} = \psi_a \psi_b$$

and such that the   'cocycle condition'

$$g_{a, cb} \psi_a (g_{b, c}) = g_{ab, c} g_{a, b}$$

holds.
