_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:_ Er, I meant to say here: _Meas_ is the category of measure spaces and measure-preserving maps. 

But now I recall that [[John Baez|John]] [uses](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0812/0812.4969v1.pdf) _Meas_ for a 2-categorical version of that.

Which terminology should we use? What's the standard term for the category of measure spaces?
