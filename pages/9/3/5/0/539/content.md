_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:_ Er, I meant to say here: _Meas_ is the category of measure spaces and measure-preserving maps. 

But now I recall that [[John Baez|John]] [uses](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0812/0812.4969v1.pdf) _Meas_ for a 2-categorical version of that.

Which terminology should we use? What's the standard term for the category of measure spaces?

_Toby_: You can distinguish them as $\MeasSp$ and $\MeasCat$. But by default, I would expect $\Meas$ to mean $\MeasSp$. (Unless there was some sense that $\Meas\Sp$ can be built out of $\Sp$ and some operator $\Meas$, kind of like how $\Gray\Cat$ is $\Gray-\Cat$ for suitable [[Gray]]. But life is probably not that beautiful.)
