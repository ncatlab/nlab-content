A coherence theorem in category theory can mean one of several things: 

* Given a [[doctrine]], such as the doctrine for monoidal categories, a coherence theorem may provide a full or partial algorithm for deciding equality in free algebras. For instance, one may be interested in the coherence problem for closed categories: how does one decide equality of morphisms in freely generated closed categories, or in other words, how does one decide which diagrams (generated from the closed structure) commute? 

* Or, given a doctrine for "weak" categorical structures of some sort, such as symmetric monoidal categories which are "weak" commutative monoids in $Cat$, a coherence theorem may provide a means for fully or partially strictifying such structures, to the effect that every weak structure is weakly equivalent to a strictified structure. For example, every symmetric monoidal category is symmetric-monoidally equivalent not to a commutative monoid in $Cat$, but to a symmetric strict monoidal category. This may be regarded as a partial or semi-strictification result. 

These two senses are connected of course, particularly in work from the Australian school during the early 1970's that centers on the concept of [[club]], a particular sort of doctrine. We describe some of this below. 

Naturally, it should not be thought that coherence problems are restricted to 1-category theory; for instance, the main result in Gordon, Power and Street's _Coherence in Tricategories_ is that every tricategory is triequivalent to a category enriched in the monoidal category $Gray$. This is an example of a semi-strictification result, and is the tip of an iceberg of hoped-for further coherence theorems for algebraic notions of $n$-category.
