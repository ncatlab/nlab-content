# Double Chu and 2-Chu constructions

## Definition

The [[Chu construction]] can be expressed as a [[functor]] from the category of co-
subunary (symmetric) [[polycategories]] to the category of symmetric polycategories, which is right adjoint to the forgetful functor.  Since it is a right adjoint, it preserves limits, and therefore also [[internal categories]].

Any [[2-polycategory]] $C$ has a double polycategory $\mathbb{Q}(C)$ of [[quintets]], in which the horizontal arrows are those of $C$ and the vertical arrows are the unary co-unary arrows in $C$, with the 2-cells filled by "square" 2-cells in $C$.  (Of course, an ordinary polycategory can be regarded as a locally discrete 2-polycategory, and in this case the 2-cells in $\mathbb{Q}(C)$ are *commutative* squares in $C$.)  If $C$ is a co-subunary 2-polycategory, then $Chu(\mathbb{Q}(C))$ is a [[double polycategory]] called its **double Chu construction** $\mathbb{C}hu(C)$.

Discarding the nonidentity vertical arrows in $\mathbb{C}hu(C)$ yields a 2-polycategory called the **2-Chu construction**.
