#Definition:# (Here is an extended version)

A **profinite group** is a [[filtered limit|filtered inverse limit]] of [[finite group|finite groups]] within the category of topological groups. (The finite groups are given the discrete topology.) Equivalently, it is a Hausdorff, compact, totally disconnected [[topological group]].

An alternative, and still equivalent, definition is that a **profinite group** is a [[pro-object]] in the category of [[finite group|finite groups]].

#Examples#

* A motivating example is the absolute [[Galois group]] of a number field.

* In SGA1, Grothendieck definied the fundamental group of a scheme to be a profinite group.  (This is linked with his work on [[pro-representable functor|pro-representable functors]].)

#Developments from the concept#
* The category of profinite groups has nice 'exactness' properties. The projective limit of a systems of profinite groups is an exact functor, unlike its behaviour on groups themselves. To extend this behaviour beyond (pro)finite groups sometimes pro-localic groups have been used.

* In Algebraic Topology, profinite homotopy types are frequently encountered. This is often because of the use of profinite completions of homotopy types in an attempt to get more information out of the invariants. 

* In the 1960s Artin and Mazur constructed a functor which associates to
each locally noetherian scheme $X$ its &#233;tale homotopy type $X_{et}$ , an object of
$pro-Ho(SSets)$, the [[pro-category]] of the homotopy category $Ho(SSets)$ of simplicial sets. They observed that this did not correspond to a homotopy category of a [[model category]] on a category of pro simplicial sets.



* In the 1990s, Morel and Voevodsky, defined a neat framework
for the use of topological methods in algebraic geometry. They embedded the
category of smooth schemes of 'finite type over a field k into a larger category
of 'k-spaces', which carries the structure of a closed model category. The study of these k-spaces is linked to &#233;tale homotopy theory, see Schmidt, _On the &#233;tale homotopy type of
Morel-Voevodsky spaces_, and Isaksen, _Etale realization on the $A^1$-homotopy theory of schemes_. Adv. in Math. 184, 37-63 (2004).
