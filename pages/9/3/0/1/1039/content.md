## Definition

### General

An [[∞-groupoid]] or a [[topological space]] or another realization of the concept [[(n,r)-category|(∞,0)-category]] is **contractible** if it is [[weak equivalence|weakly equivalent]] to the [[point]].

$$
  (C \;\text{is contractible}) \Leftrightarrow
  (C \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} *)
  \,.
$$

Sometimes one allows also the empty object $\emptyset$ to be contractible. To distinguish this, we say

* an $\infty$-groupoid is **(-1)-[[truncated]]** (is a [[(-1)-groupoid]]) if it is either empty or equivalent to the point;

* an $\infty$-groupoid is **(-2)-[[truncated]]** (is a [[(-2)-groupoid]]) if it is equivalent to the point.

Notice that since the [[Whitehead theorem]] applies in [[∞Grpd]], being weakly equivalent to the point is the same as there being a contraction.
