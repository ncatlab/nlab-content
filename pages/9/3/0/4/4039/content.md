## Idea

**Variational calculus** deals with local extremization of [[functionals]] employing some aspects of the [[differential calculus]] on spaces of [[functional]]s. 

Specifically, it studies the critical points, i.e. the points where the first variational derivative of a functional vanishes, for functionals on spaces of [[section]]s of [[jet bundle]]s. The kinds of equations specifying these critical points are [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s.

This applies to, and is largely motivated from, the study of [[action functional]]s in [[physics]]. In [[classical physics]] the critical points of a specified action functional on the space of field configurations encode the physically observable configurations.

There are strong [[cohomology|cohomological]] tools for studying variational calculus, such as the [[variational bicomplex]] and [[BV-BRST formalism]].
