
## Idea

Given a [[concrete category]], that is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a [[functor]] $U$ from $C$ to the [[category of sets]] (satisfying certain conditions), we call $U$ a [[forgetful functor]] and call $U(x)$, for $x$ an [[object]] of $C$, the __underlying set__ of $x$.

In the case where $C$ is explicitly a category of [[structured sets]], then every object $x$ of $C$ is a [[set]] ${|x|}$ equipped with some [[extra structure|extra]] [[structure]]. In that case, the underlying set of $x$ is precisely this set ${|x|}$.

More generally, if $C$ is concrete over another [[category]] $D$, in that we have a [[faithful functor]] $U \colon C \to D$, then given any object $x\colon C$, its __underlying object__ of $D$ is $U(x)$.
