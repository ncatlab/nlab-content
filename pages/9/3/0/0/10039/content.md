###### Definition

Given a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ between two [[dualizable objects]] in a [[symmetric monoidal category]], the corresponding **dual morphism**

$$
  f^\ast \colon Y^\ast \to X^\ast
$$

is the one obtained by $f$ by composing the the duality [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] of $X$, the duality [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] of $Y$ and the [[braiding]] of $X$ with $Y$...

###### Example

If $A$, $B$ are [[C*-algebras]] which are [[Poincar√© duality algebras]], hence [[dualizable objects]] in the [[KK-theory]]-category, then for $f \colon A \to B$ a morphism it is [[K-orientation|K-oriented]], the corresponding [[Umkehr map]] is (postcomposition) with the dual morphism of its [[opposite algebra]] version:

$$
  f! \coloneqq (f^op)^\ast
  \,.
$$
