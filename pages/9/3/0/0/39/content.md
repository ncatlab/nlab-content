###### Definition
**(quasi-free differential graded-commutative algebras)**

A _quasi-free differential graded commutative algebra_
(**qDGCA**) is an algebra of smooth functions $A := C^\infty(X)$ on a manifold $X$ together with a degree +1 graded derivation $d$ on the free (over $A$) graded-(anti-)commutative algebra
$
  \wedge^\bullet g^* = S^\bullet g^*[1]
$
on the dual (over $A$) of a non-positively graded cochain complex $g$ of $A$-modules, such that $d^2 = 0$.
