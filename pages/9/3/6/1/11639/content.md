## Idea

In higher dimensional analogy of how the [[formal Picard group]] of an [[elliptic curve]] gives the [[formal group]] of an [[elliptic spectrum]] representing an [[elliptic cohomology theory]], so the [[formal Brauer group]] of a [[K3 surface]] gives the formal group of an [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] given by a [[spectrum]] hence called a _K3-spectrum_ [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] _K3-cohomology_ ([Szymik 10, section 4.2](#Szymik10)).

## Properties

### Existence

The [[formal Brauer groups]] $\Phi^2_{X}$ of [[K3 surfaces]] $X$ have [[height of a formal group|height]] in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,\infty\}$, and all values appear. ([Artin 74](#Artin74), [Artin-Mazur 77](#ArtinMazur77)).

By the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]] there is a K3-spectrum associated with $\Phi^2_X$ if it is Landweber exact.

([Szymik 10, theorem 1](#Szymik10)) gives sufficient conditions for this to be the case and ([Szymik 10, prop. 7, prop. 8](#Szymik10)) say that these condition are satisfied for enough K3 surfaces to realize all formal Brauer groups (...add details...).
