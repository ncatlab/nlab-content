## Idea

A [[physical system]] in [[solid state physics]] consisting of [[electrons]] confined to an essentially 2-dimensional surface and subject to a perpendicular [[magnetic field]].

In an appropriate limit of low [[temperature]] aspects of this system are described by the [[topological quantum field theory]] called _[[Chern-Simons theory]]_. In this limit the system has been proposed as constituting a possible implementation of [[topological quantum computation]].


## Properties

### As a topological insulator

The bulk/edge behaviour in a quantum Hall effect is is that of a [[topological insulator]]. (While topological insulator materials typically show this behaviour without the need of a strong magnetic field.)
