## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[differential cohesion]], then given any [[space]] $X$ and a [[point]] $x \colon \ast \to X$, then the _formal disk_ in $X$ at $x$ is just the [[infinitesimally thickened point]] which is the [[formal neighbourhood]] of that point. If there is a concept of [[dimension]] for $X$, then the dimension of that formal disk is the dimension of $X$ at that point.

[[Isbell duality|Dually]] in terms of [[function algebras]], in the typical models formal disks are the [[formal spectra]] of [[formal power series]] algebras. The formal spectra of the [[Laurent series]] algebras are instead the "punctured formal disks", hence formal disks with their unique global point removed.

More concretely, if $S$ is any [[infinity-cohesive site]] of "differentiable spaces" (such as for instance [[complex analytic manifolds]]) and $S_{synthdiff}$ is the corresponding site of infinitesimal thickenings (for instance complex analytic [[smooth loci]] of the form the product of a complex manifold with an [[infinitesimally thickened point]]), then we have relative [[cohesion]] of $Sh_\infty(S_{synthdiff})$ over $Sh_\infty(InfPoints)$ (see at _[[synthetic differential âˆž-groupoid]]_) and for any space $X$ then the [[flat modality]] takes it to its union $\flat X$ of all formal disks around all [[global points]] of $X$.
