## Idea

Given a [[coherent space]], $X$, a new topology may be constructed by taking as [[topological base|basic open subsets]] the closed sets of $X$ with [[quasicompact]] complements. This space $X^{\vee}$ is called the _Hochster dual_ of $X$. The space $X^{\vee}$ is also coherent and $X^{\vee \vee} = X$. 

The Hochster dual of a [[distributive lattice]] is the opposite lattice. The Hochster dual of a coherent [[frame]] is its join [[completion]].
