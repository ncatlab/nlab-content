## Idea

A _logical framework_ is a formal [[metalanguage]] for deductive systems, such as [[natural deduction]], [[type theories]], [[sequent calculus]], etc. 


## Examples

For a list see at _[Specific logical Frameworks and Implementations](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/lfs-impl.html)_.

Historically, the first logical framework was [[Automath]].
The goal of the Automath project was to provide a tool for the
formalization of mathematics without [[foundations|foundational]] prejudice.
Many modern logical frameworks carry influences of this.

Then inspired by the development of [[Martin-LÃ¶f dependent type theory]] was the [[Edinburgh Logical Framework]] (ELF).

The [[logic]] and [[type theory]]-approaches were later combined in the [[Elf]] language. This gave rise to [[Twelf]].
