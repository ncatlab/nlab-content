
[[differential geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]], cf. *[[GAGA]]*

The following table illustrates some parallels between [[algebraic geometry]] and [[differential geometry]].  There is also a third column for (holomorphic) [[complex geometry]].
These parallels are formalized using the notion of a [[Fermat theory]].
