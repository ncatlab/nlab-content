## Idea

Given a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[topological group|group]] $G$ and a $G$-[[G-space|space]] $X$, one can consider the category of $G$-[[equivariant sheaves]] on $X$. It has been understood by [[Joseph Bernstein]] and [[Valery Lunts]] that the [[derived category]] of the [[abelian category]] of equivariant sheaves (or of any other abelian category) is not the most sensible choice, when the [[action]] is not [[free action|free]]. Instead one needs to use $G$-[[resolutions]], i.e. to effectively consider resolutions of the space $X$ itself while defining the derived category.
