Uffe Haagerup was a Danish mathematician.
He received a Master's degree in 1973 from the University of Copenhagen, advised by [[Gert Pedersen]],
and went on to become a professor at the University of Odense in 1981 without a doctorate.

His work is concentrated around the field of [[von Neumann algebras]]
(and [[noncommutative measure theory]]).
He is responsible for developing many fundamental concepts in this area,
including the [[standard form of a von Neumann algebra]] (analogous
to the [[L^2-space]]),
[[noncommutative L^p-spaces]], [[weights]] and [[operator valued weights]] on [[von Neumann algebras]] (analogous to (fiberwise) [[measures]]), and many others.
