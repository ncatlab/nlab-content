###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]]. This is called an _exact $(\infty,1)$-category_ if

1. $\mathcal{C}$ has a [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]] and [[homotopy fiber products]];

1. [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|groupoid objects]] in $\mathcal{C}$ are effective:

1. realization of groupoid objects is [[universal colimit|universal]].

## Other notions of "exact"

There is another meaning for "exact (∞,1)-category" for which there is a [[Quillen Q-construction]] for exact (∞,1)-categories which allows to compute its [[algebraic K-theory]].
