## Idea

The notion of **3-groupoid** is the next higher generalization in [[higher category theory]] of [[groupoid]] and [[2-groupoid]]. 

## Definition

A **3-groupoid** is an [[∞-groupoid]] such that all [[parallel pair]]s of [[k-morphism]] are [[equivalence|equivalent]] for $k \geq 4$: a 3-[[truncated]] [[∞-groupoid]].

Thus, up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $3$-morphisms, except whether two given parallel $3$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition may give a concept more general than your preferred definition of $3$-groupoid, but it will be equivalent; basically, you may have to rephrase equivalence of $3$-morphisms as [[equality]].

See also [[n-groupoid]].

## Models

A general 3-groupoid is [[geometric definition of higher categories|geometrically modeled]] by a 4-[[simplicial skeleton|coskeletal]] [[Kan complex]]. Equivalently -- via the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem -- by a [[homotopy 3-type]].

A small model of this is a 3-[[hypergroupoid]], where all [[horn]]-filelrs in dimension $\geq 4$ are _unique_ .

A 3-groupoid is [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraically modeled]] by a [[tricategory]] in which all morphisms are invertible, and by a 3-[[truncated]] [[algebraic Kan complex]]. 

A [[semi-strict infinity-category|semistrict]] [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic model]] for 3-groupoids is provided by the notion of [[Gray-groupoid]]. These in turn are encoded by [[2-crossed module]]s.

An entirely strict algebraic model for 3-groupoids (which no longer models all [[homotopy 3-type]]s) is a 3-[[truncated]] [[strict omega-groupoid]].
