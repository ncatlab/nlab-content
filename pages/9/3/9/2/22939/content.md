## Idea

The **$E_8$ manifold** is the unique [[compact]], [[simply connected]] topological 4-[[manifold]] with [[intersection pairing|intersection form]] the [[E8]] [[lattice in a vector space|lattice]].

The $E_{8}$ manifold has no [[smooth structure]], nor even is [[triangulation theorem|triangulable]] as a [[simplicial complex]].
