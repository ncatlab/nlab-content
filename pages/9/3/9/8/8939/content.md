## Definition

An [[internal hom]] in a [[(2,1)-topos]] of [[stacks]] or generally in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[∞-stacks]] is often called a **mapping stack** or **[[mapping ∞-stack]]**, in analogy with _[[mapping space]]_.

## Properties

By the general formula for [[internal homs]] in [[toposes]], for $X, A \in \mathbf{H}$ two stacks or $\infty$-stacks, their mapping stack assigns to an object $U \in C$ in a [[site]] or [[(∞,1)-site]] of definition the [[groupoid]] or [[∞-groupoid]] given by

$$
 [X, A] \;\colon\; U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(X \times U, A)
  \,.
$$
