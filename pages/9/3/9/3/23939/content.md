The name "bananaspace" is an inside-joke on a typo for *[[Banach space]]* that occurred in the presentation of a friend of the founders ([here](https://twitter.com/jasonchen0325/status/1526583860191825920), cf. [Miller 2011, p. 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~asnowden/teaching/2011/18.904/lec/lec-03-02a.pdf#page=2)).
