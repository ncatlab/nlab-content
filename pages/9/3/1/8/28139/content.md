# Spacial portal
Derived from the famous video game series "Portal (2007, 2011)", the Spacial portal the result of cutting and guling the surounding ambiant space.
this creates linked portal surfaces and the material space (the new space after the gluing).

#### More rigorously
> an Ambient space is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space, usually denoted X. Note this means X is a Tychonoff space. This is the default space that we work in.

> A surface S is a set in ambient space that equals its boundary: S = ∂S. We use the symbol S by default to denote a surface in the ambient space X.

> A topological portal in the ambient space X is an ordered set (S, F, g) where S is a surface in X, F is a family of portal functions of S, and g is a global gluing pattern on S made from F.
