## Idea

In [[categorical algebra]], by a *monad transformation* one may mean a [[natural transformation]] between (the [[underlying]] [[functors]] of) [[monads]] (on [[Cat]]), suitably compatible with the monad structure to constitute a [[1-morphism]] in the [category of monads](monad#TransformationOfMonadsOnFixedCategory).

Beware that for [[monads in computer science]] the similar term *[[monad transformer]]* is used for [[natural transformation|natural]] families of such monad transformations.
