## Idea

By [[analogy]] of [[spin]] and [[spin^c]] with [[Mp]] and [[Mp^c]] and in view of [[spin representations]], the standard Segal-Shale-Weil [[metaplectic representation]] is also called the _symplectic spinor representation_.

Accordingly, an [[associated bundle]] for this representation is also called a _symplectic spinor bundle_ (in [[analogy]] with [[spinor bundles]]). This plays a role in [[metaplectic quantization]].
