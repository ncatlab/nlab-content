## Idea ##

What is called the _AKSZ formalism_ -- after the initials of its four authors -- Alexandrov, [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]], Schwarz, Zaborosnky -- is a a special technique for constructing [[path integral|action functional]]s  in [[gauge theory]].

More precisely, it is a method for constructing a [[BV theory|BV Laplacian]] for a [[sigma-model]] with a given symplectic [[NQ-supermanifold]] $X$ target space which describes a generalization of the [[Poisson sigma-model]].

## conceptual context and background ##

The AKSZ construction assumes parameter space and target space of the [[sigma-model]] to be [[quantization|quantized]] to be modeled in terms of [[NQ-supermanifolds]]. These may conceptually be thought of as representing [[Lie-∞ algebroid]]s. In a general context of [[sigma-model]] quantization, such as described for instance at

* [[exercise in groupoidification - the path integral]]

* [[geometric ∞-function theory]]

target space would instead be represented by a [[Lie ∞-groupoid]]. In a complete picture of [[sigma-model]] [[quantization]] the ASZ method should therefore be a means to handle a linearized or infinitesimal approximation to the full theory.
