A __skewfield__ (also spelled skew-field) or a __division ring__ is a unital [[ring]] where each nonzero element has an inverse. A commutative skewfield is called a [[field]], but sometimes in specialized works on skewfields one often says simply field for a skewfield.

Very often textbooks develop linear algebra in generality of division rings, namely the usual notions of basis, dimension, linear map, matrix of a linear map with respect to two bases and so on, pass without changes for left or right vector spaces over a division field.

The most famous noncommutative example is the skewfield of quaternions. Frobenious theorem states that apart from the fields of real and of complex numbers and quaternions, there are no associative finite-dimensional division algebras over real numbers; and even if one includes nonassociative finite-dimensional division algebras one obtains only one more example (octonions).
