## Idea

Directly analogous to the concept of [[completion of a ring]] is the _completion of a module_ over that ring.

## Properties

### Relation of formal completion to torsion approximation
 {#RelationToTorsionApproximation}

For suitable ideals $\mathfrak{a}\subset A$ of a commutative ring $A$, then the [[derived functor]] of $\mathfrak{a}$-adic [[completion of a module|completion of A-modules]] forms together with $\mathfrak{a}$-[[torsion approximation]] an [[adjoint modality]] on the  
[[(âˆž,1)-category of modules]] over $A$. See at _[arithmetic fracturing for chain complexes](fracture+theorem#CompletionAndTorsionOnDerivedCategories)_ for details.
