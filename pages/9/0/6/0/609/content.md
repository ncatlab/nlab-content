## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of *simplicial groupoids* pairs the concepts of *[[groupoids]]* and *[[simplicial sets]]*. Via the [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]] functor &lbrack;[Dwyer & Kan (1984)](#DwyerKan84)&rbrack; their [[homotopy]] theory is equivalent to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets|classical]] homotopy theory of [[simplicial sets]]/[[Kan complexes]] (both being models for [[infinity-groupoids|$\infty$-groupoids]]).


## Definition
 {#Definition}

A priori, the term *simplicial groupoid* may refer to [[simplicial objects]] in the ([[1-category|1-]])[[category]] [[Grpd]] of ([[small category|small]]) [[strict category|strict]] [[groupoids]].

However (cf. discussion at *[[simplicial category]]*), in applications (notably in [[homotopy theory]]) one is interested only in those simplicial objects in [[Grpd]] whose [[underlying]] simplicial [[sets]] of [[objects]] are *simplicially constant*. This more restrictive notion is traditionally still referred to as "simplicial groupoids" &lbrack;e.g. [Dwyer & Kan (1984),  ยง1.2.(ii)](#DwyerKan84), [Goerss & Jardine (2009), V.7](GoerssJardine09)&rbrack;; but for the moment let us call these instead "simplicial DK-groupoids", for clarity, and let us denote the [[full subcategory]] they form by

$$
  sGrpd_{DK} 
    \overset{\phantom{---}}{\hookrightarrow} 
  Func(\Delta^{op}, Grpd)
  \,.
$$

So given such a simplicial DK-groupoid $\mathcal{C}_\bullet \,\in\, sGrpd_{DK}$ we have:

1. a plain [[set]] of [[objects]] $Obj(\mathcal{C}_\bullet) \,\in\, Sets$;

1. for every [[pair]] $x, y \,\in\, Obj(\mathcal{C}_\bullet)$ of [[objects]] the degree-wise [[hom-sets]] form a [[simplicial set]] 

   $$
     \mathcal{C}_\bullet(x,y)
     \;\coloneqq\;
     Hom_{\mathcal{C}_\bullet}(x,y)
     \;\in\;
     sSet
     \,;
   $$

1. where the degreewise [[composition]] operations constitutes an [[sSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] composition operation

   $$
     \mathcal{C}_\bullet(x,y)
     \,\times\,
     \mathcal{C}_\bullet(y,z)
     \overset{\circ}{\longrightarrow}
     \mathcal{C}_\bullet(x,z)
   $$

1. making $\mathcal{C}_\bullet$ an [[sSet-enriched category]].

Conversely, simplical DK-groupoids are therefore in [[bijection]] to those [[sSet-enriched categories]] whose degreewise [[categories]] formed by the $n$-cell [[morphisms]] for any $n \,\in\, \mathbb{N}$ are [[groupoids]].

This makes the category $sGrpd_{DK}$ be a [[full subcategory]] of the category of ([[small category|small]]) [[sSet-enriched categories]]:

$$
  sGrpd_{DK} 
    \overset{\phantom{---}}{\hookrightarrow} 
  sSet Cat
  \,.
$$


## Remarks
 
*  Simplicially enriched groupoids are related to [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]] via an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] found independently by Dwyer & Kan and Joyal & Tierney; see *[[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]*.  This adjunction gives an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] so that simplicially enriched groupoids model all [[homotopy type|homotopy types]].

   *  This is a groupoidal version of the equivalence between [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] and [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]] via the [[homotopy coherent nerve]].

*  A simplicially enriched groupoid having exactly one object is essentially the same as a [[simplicial group]]. Notationally however it is often important to distinguish a simplicial group form the corresponding single object simplicially enriched groupoid.

*  Many constructions on simplicial groups, such as that of its [[Moore complex]] carry over to simplicialy enriched groupoids without difficulty.
