A **simplicial groupoid** is a [[simplicially enriched category]] which is all the categories involved are [[groupoid]]s.

A **simplicially enriched groupoid** is a groupoid [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category [[SimpSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s.  Equivalently, a simplicially enriched groupoid is a simplicial groupoid in which the face and degeneracy operators are constant on objects.

Simplicially enriched groupoids are related to [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]] via an [[adjunction]] found independently by Dwyer&#8211;Kan and Joyal&#8211;Tierney; see [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]].  This adjunction gives an [[equivalence]] of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] so that simplicially enriched groupoids model all [[homotopy type|homotopy types]].
