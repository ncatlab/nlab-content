## On nothing, being and becoming

On [[being]], [[nothing]] and [[becoming]] (English translation following [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] [here](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/94612/5603)):

> The nameless nonbeing is the origin of universe;

> The named being is the mother of all observed things.

> Within nonbeing, we enjoy the mystery of the universe.

> Among being, we observe the richness of the world.

> Nonbeing and being are two aspects of the same mystery.

> From nonbeing to being and from being to nonbeing is the gateway to all understanding.
