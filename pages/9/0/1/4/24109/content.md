## Definition

The **Banach fixed-point theorem** states: 

Let $(X, \rho)$ be a [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[metric space]] with a point $x_0$ and is bounded by $C : \mathbb{Q}$. Let $T : X \to X$ be an endomap with a rational [[Lipschitz constant]] $0 \lt c \lt 1$. Then $X$ has a unique [[fixed point]], i.e. we have a point $x$ with $\rho(T (x), x) = 0$,
and for any $y : X$ with $\rho(T (y), y) = 0$ we have $x = y$.
