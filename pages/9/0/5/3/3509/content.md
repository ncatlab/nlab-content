There are several related notions dealing with similar notions. Historically the first is 

* [[stable homotopy category]] of spectra 

and V. Puppe shown that it has a [[triangulated category|triangulated structure]]. Stability referred to [[stable homotopy theory]] and invertibility of [[suspension]] there. 

Then Waldhausen came up with

* [[Waldhausen category]]

with the applications in [[algebraic K-theory]]. His construction of K-theory for Quillen exact categories could be factored in two steps and the intermediate case is the Waldhausen category. From each [[Quillen exact category]] one can produce its **stable category** which is an example of a [[suspended category]] rather than triangulated. In particular, its suspension is not invertible in general it is in the case when the exact category is Frobenius (and in particular when it is abelian). [[Alexander Rosenberg|A. Rosenberg]] has devised a generalization of suspended category to a nonadditive setting.

Finally there are more complete descriptions of stability in notions of [[stable model category|stable model categories]], studied mainly in 1990s, stable Segal categories of French school and [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable quasi-categories]] of Joyal and of Lurie. 

Should there be stable $(\infinity,n)$-categories at some point ?
