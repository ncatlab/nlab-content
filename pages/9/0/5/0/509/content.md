In a [[category]] with a [[terminal object]], a **pointed object** is an [[object]] $X$ equipped with a [[global element]] $1\to X$.

A pointed object is distinguished from an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] one in that the chosen point is _structure_ rather than a property.  In particular, a morphism of pointed objects is a morphism in the original category which preserves the points.  In other words, the category of pointed objects in $C$ is the [[co-slice category]] $1/C$ under the terminal object.

## Examples ##

* Pointed [[topological space|topological spaces]] and [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]] are important in [[homotopy theory]].

* Pointed $n$-[[n-category|categories]] figure prominently in the [[delooping hypothesis]]; see also [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].

* In a category with a [[zero object]], every object is automatically pointed in a unique way.

## Remarks ##

* If $C$ is a [[monoidal category]] (usually [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]]), there is a [[smash product]] of pointed objects which is usually the "correct" notion of product to consider.

* If $C$ is a non-cartesian monoidal category, occasionally one may instead want a "pointed object" to be one equipped with a map $I\to X$, where $I$ is the unit of the monoidal structure.
