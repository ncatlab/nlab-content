## Idea

A *Church monoid* is a particular type of [[algebra|algebraic]] [[mathematical structure]] that provides [[semantics]] for a flavour of [[relevance logic]], a weak form of [[substructural logic]].

## Definition

A Church monoid is a [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] [[commutative monoid]] $(M,\circ, 1,\leq)$ that is has a binary operation, "implication", written $a\to b$ that as an operation $b\mapsto (a\to b)$ is [[right adjoint]] to the [[functor]] $-\circ a$. Here $M$ is considered as a [[thin category]] associated to the underlying [[poset]]. Additionally, for all $a\in M$, $a \leq a\circ a$, resulting in a [[monoidal category with diagonals]], where $\circ$ is the monoidal product.
