###### Proposition
**([[topological space|topological]] [[homotopy type]] is [[cohesive shape]] of [[continuous diffeology]])**

For every $X \in$ [[TopologicalSpaces]], the [[cohesive shape]]/[[path âˆž-groupoid]] presented by its _diffeological singular simplicial set_ (Def. \ref{DiffeologicalSingularSimplicialSet}, Remark \ref{DiffeologicalSingularSetIsPathGroupoid}) of its [[continuous diffeology]] is [[natural transformation|naturally]] [[weak homotopy equivalence|weak homotopy equivalent]] to the [[homotopy type]] of $X$ presented by the ordinary [[singular simplicial set]]:

$$
  Sing_{diff}
  \big(
    Cdfflg(X)
  \big)
  \;\simeq_{whe}\;
  Sing(X)
  \,.
$$
