## Idea

The **four-colour theorem**, or **four colour map theorem**, states that given any separation of a [[plane]] into contiguous regions, called a _map_, the regions can be coloured using at most four colours so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. Regions are considered adjacent if they share a boundary segment.
