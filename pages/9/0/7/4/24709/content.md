## Idea

A version of [[canonicity]] where the [[definitional equalities]] are replaced with [[identity types]]. 

In the case for the [[natural numbers type]] homotopy canonicity states that every natural number $n:\mathbb{N}$ comes with a natural number $m:\mathbb{N}$ and an [[identification]] to the [[canonical form]] $p:n =_\mathbb{N} \mathrm{succ}^m(0)$. 

## Examples

* [[Chris Kapulkin]] and [[Christian Sattler]] have an unpublished proof that [[homotopy type theory]] has homotopy canonicity, even though HoTT does not have [[canonicity]]

* [[cubical type theory]] has homotopy canonicity
