## Definition

A **01-bounded semilattice** $L$ is a [[semilattice]] which is also a [[bounded poset]] with respect to the semilattice-induced [[partial order]], with [[bottom element]] $0 \in L$ and [[top element]] $1 \in L$. 

Equivalently, $L$ is a [[semilattice]] with an [[absorbing element]] and a [[neutral element]] with respect to the semilattice operation. The absorption and neutral axioms automatically imply that the semilattice is bounded. $L$ is called a **01-bounded join-semilattice** if $0$ is the neutral element and $1$ is the absorbing element, and $L$ is called a **01-bounded meet-semilattice** if $1$ is the neutral element and $0$ is the absorbing element

The [[Lawvere theory]] of 01-bounded semilattices is the [[semilattice cube category]], the [[cartesian cube category]] with one connection.
