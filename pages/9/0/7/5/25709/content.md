__Brace algebra__ involves higher-order operations related to the study of $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebra]]s. There is a sequence of canonical functors

dendriform algebras --> brace algebras --> pre-Lie algebras

Hence, in some sense, brace algebras are intermediate between [[dendriform algebra]]s and [[pre-Lie algebra]]s. 

There is also a notion of a __symmetric brace algebra__ which has analogous role for $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebra]]s instead of $A_\infty$. They are related to post-Lie algebras.
