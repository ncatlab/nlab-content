Disambiguation: there is a different notion of a coherent functor due Auslander as a finitely presented object in the category of additive functors from a fixed abelian category to the category of abelian groups, see [[abelianization of an additive category]]. This terminology is suggested by algebra where coherent algebras and modules have alike definition.

## Definition

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ between [[coherent categories]] is called **coherent** if it is a [[regular functor]] and in addition preserves finite [[union]]s.

## Properties

* For $\mathcal{T}$ a [[coherent theory]] and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ its [[syntactic category]], coherent functors $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}} \to \mathcal{E}$ into some [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ are precisely [[model]]s of the theory in $\mathcal{E}$.

  For $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ equipped with the structure of the [[syntactic site]] (the [[coherent coverage]]), this is in turn equivalent to [[geometric morphism]]s $\mathcal{E} \to Sh(\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}})$ into the [[sheaf topos]] over $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ (the [[classifying topos]] for the theory).
