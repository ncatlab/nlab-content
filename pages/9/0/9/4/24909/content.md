## Idea

A **class theory** or **class-set theory** is a theory of [[classes]]. Class theories are usually formulated in the language of [[logic over type theory]]. 

Similar to the case with [[set theory]], there are material and structural versions of class theory as well. Material approaches to class theories include [[Morse-Kelley class theory]] and [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel class theory]], and classes are defined as formulae in the language of set theory for a truth value, equipped with a specified free variable for a class; a formula for a class in a given context $\Gamma$ is a formula for a truth value in the extension of $\Gamma$ by one more free variable for a set. Structural approaches to class theories include [[category with class structure]] and the general field of [[algebraic set theory]], and classes are defined as [[objects]] in a suitably presented [[well-pointed category]]. 

In contrast to [[material set theories]] like [[ZFC]] and [[structural set theories]] like [[ETCS]] or [[SEAR]], the notion of [[set]] is not a primitive in the theory. It is instead a defined notion from the primitive notion of [[class]]. 

While class theories address the issue of size in mathematics, they violate the [[principle of equivalence]] for higher structures like [[groupoids]], because, like sets in set theory, every class in class theory has [[propositional equality]], including [[groupoids]] defined in class theory. 

## Semantics and models

Let $U$ be a [[universe]], and let $\mathrm{Set}_U$ be the [[universe]] of [[sets]] in $U$, and let $\Omega$ be a collection of [[propositions]]. A model of [[set theory]] is $\mathrm{Set}_U$, while a model of [[class theory]] is the collection of [[predicates]] $\mathrm{Set}_U \to \Omega$.
