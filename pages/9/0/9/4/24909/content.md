## Idea

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], a **class theory** or **class-set theory** is a [[theory]] of [[classes]]. Class theories are usually formulated in the language of [[logic over type theory]]. 

Similar to the case with [[set theory]], there are [[material versus structural|material and structural versions]] of class theory as well: 

Material approaches to class theories include *[[Morse-Kelley class theory]]* and *[[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel class theory]]*. Here, classes are defined as [[formulae]] in the language of set theory for a [[truth value]], equipped with a specified [[free variable]] for a class; a formula for a class in a given context $\Gamma$ is a formula for a truth value in the extension of $\Gamma$ by one more free variable for a set. 

Structural approaches to class theories include *[[category with class structure]]* and the general field of *[[algebraic set theory]]*. Here, classes are defined as [[objects]] in a suitably presented [[well-pointed category]]. 

In contrast to [[material set theories]] like [[ZFC]] and [[structural set theories]] like [[ETCS]] or [[SEAR]], the notion of [[set]] is not a primitive in the theory. It is instead a defined notion from the primitive notion of [[class]]. 

While class theories address the [[size issue|issue of size]] in mathematics, they violate the [[principle of equivalence]] for [[higher structures]] like [[groupoids]], because, like sets in set theory, every class in class theory has [[propositional equality]], including [[groupoids]] defined in class theory. 

## Semantics and models

Let $U$ be a [[universe]], and let $\mathrm{Set}_U$ be the [[universe]] of [[sets]] in $U$, and let $\Omega$ be a collection of [[propositions]]. A [[model]] of [[set theory]] is $\mathrm{Set}_U$, while a model of [[class theory]] is the collection of [[predicates]] $\mathrm{Set}_U \to \Omega$.
