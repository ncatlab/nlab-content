A [[functor]] $F: C \to D$ from the category $C$ to the category $D$ is _faithful_ if for each pair of objects $x, y \in C$, the function

$$F : C(x,y) \to D(F(x), F(y))$$

is one-to-one.  

More abstractly, we may say a functor is faithful if it is $2$-[[k-surjective functor|surjective]] &#8211; or loosely speaking, 'surjective on equations between given morphisms'.
