## Definition

Denote by $Emb_n$ the [[site]] of $n$-dimensional [[smooth manifolds]] and [[open embeddings]].

An [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] $F\colon Emb_n^op\to Top$ of [[topological spaces]] is __microflexible__ if for any closed inclusion $K\to K'$ of [[compact spaces]],
the induced map $F(K')\to F(K)$ is a [[Serre microfibration]].

An [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] $F\colon Emb_n^op\to Top$ of [[topological spaces]] is __flexible__ if for any closed inclusion $K\to K'$ of [[compact spaces]],
the induced map $F(K')\to F(K)$ is a [[Serre fibration]].

## Gromov's theorem

Given an [[open manifold]] $M$,
the inclusion of microflexible sheaves into flexible sheaves
on the site $Emb_n/M$ is an equivalence of [[(∞,1)-categories]].
