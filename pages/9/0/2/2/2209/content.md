[[!redirects Peirce's logic of information]]

Peirce's incipient theory of information, that he appears to have developed by sheer force of logical insight from his early understanding of signs and scientific inquiry, is not an easy subject to grasp in its developing state.  An attempt to follow his reasoning step by step might well begin with this:

: Let us now return to the information.

: The information of a term is the measure of its superfluous comprehension.

: [Peirce 1866, Lowell Lecture 7, CE 1, 467](http://mywikibiz.com/Directory:Jon_Awbrey/Papers/Information_%3D_Comprehension_%C3%97_Extension#Selection_1)

Today we would say that information has to do with constraint, law, redundancy.  I think that Peirce is talking about more or less the same thing under the theme of _superfluous comprehension_, where the comprehension of a term is the collection of properties, also known as _intensions_, that it implies about the things to which it applies.
