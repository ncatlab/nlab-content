## Idea

The _quark-gluon plasma_ is the [[phase of matter]] of [[quantum chromodynamics]] at extremely high [[temperature]]. At high temperature [[quarks]] are not [[confinement|confined]] to [[hadron]] [[bound states]] but propagate freely together with the [[gluons]], forming a "quark-gluon soup". Since this is analogous to an ordinary [[plasma]] which is a [[phase of matter|phase]] where [[electrons]] and [[protons]] are no longer [[bound state|bound]] to [[atoms]] but propagate freely, one speaks of _quark-gluon plasma_.

> **Schematic [[phase diagram]] of [[QCD]].** The vertical axis indicates [[temperature]] $T$, the horizontal axis indicates [[baryon]] [[density]]. At low enough tempeterature [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] only appear as [[hadron]] [[bound states]] ([[confinement]]). But above a critical temperature these [[hadron]] [[bound states]] break apart (deconfinement) and [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] may exist freely. This [[phase of matter|phase]] of [[QCD]] is the _quark-gluon plasma_.

### Non-perturbative regime

Despite the [[confinement|deconfinement]] beyond [[temperature]] $T_c$, the quark-gluon plasma at temperature $\sim 4-5 T_c$ as produced in [[experiment]] ([Adams et al. 05](#AdamsEtAl05), [Adcox et al. 05](#AdcoxEtAl05)) is apparently strongly [[coupling constant|coupled]], meaning that its properties are [[non-perturbative effects]] requiring discussion of [[QCD]] as a [[non-perturbative field theory]]. With an exact such theory largely missing, much of the theoretical discussion of the quark-gluon plasma involves [[lattice QCD]] computer simulation. Indication for strong coupling of the QG-plasma comes from the nature of the _elliptic flow_ seen both in [[experiment]] as well as in these computer simulations, which shows [[hydrodynamic]] behaviour with extremely small [[shear viscosity]] (e.g. [Shuryak 01](#Shuryak01), [Chakraborty 12](#Chakraborty12)).


It has been proposed ([Policastro-Son-Starinets 01](#PolicastroSonStarinets01)) that, therefore, an analytic approach to a description of the quark-gluon plasma (i.e. not just via [[lattice QCD]] computer experiment) might be given by approximate [[AdS-CFT duality]] (see e.g. [Biagazzi-Cotrone 12](#BiagazziCotrone12)). The difficulty with this approach is that for [[QCD]] (as opposed to [[N=4 D=4 SYM]]) [[AdS-CFT duality]] applies only to some approximation.

### Perturbative regime

At yet higher energies, the quark-gluon plasma is eventually supposed to be weakly [[coupling constant|coupled]] again, due to [[asymptotic freedom]] (e.g. [Blaizot 03](#Blaizot03))

## Related concepts

* The quark-gluon plasma is naturally studied in terms of [[infinite-temperature thermal field theory]] ([Blaizot-Iancu-Rebhan 03, section 2.2.4](#BlaizotIancuRebhan03), [Blaizot 04, around p. 17](#Blaizot04))
