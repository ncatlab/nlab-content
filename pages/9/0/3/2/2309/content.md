By _cohomology theory_ is usually meant more precisely an example of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] regarded as a [[functor]] that assigns abelian [[group]] or even [[ring]]s to [[topological space]]s, subject to some conditions.  Note that the subject of cohomology theories is itself simply called _[[cohomology]]_.
