## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], given [[types]] $A$ and $B$, a [[function]] $f:A \to B$ is an __effective epimorphism__ if $f$ is the [[colimit]] of its [[Čech nerve]]. See [[effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category]] for the corresponding definition in the [[categorical semantics]]. 

However, the Čech nerve of a function is a [[semi-simplicial type in homotopy type theory]], and so it is not yet known how to formally define the Čech nerve and effective epimorphisms in homotopy type theory. There have been, however, various extensions to homotopy type theory, such as [[two-level type theory]], bi-[[cubical type theory]], [[simplicial type theory]], and [[displayed type theory]], in which it is possible to define semi-simplicial types, and thus it should be possible to define the Čech nerve, its colimit, and effective epimorphisms in those theories. 

It is conjectured that the [[surjections]] $f:A \to B$ between two [[set]]s $A$ and $B$ are effective epimorphisms.
