A proper groupoid $X$ is a [[internal groupoid|topological groupoid]] $X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0$ such that the map $(s,t):X_1 \to X_0\times X_0$ is [[proper map|proper]]. This also makes sense when $X$ is a [[Lie groupoid]] - just consider the underlying topological groupoid.

Proper groupoids are most often seen when discussing [[orbifolds]], which are proper [[etale groupoid|etale]] groupoids.
