A _finitely complete_ category is a category $C$ which admits all finite limits, that is a finite limit for any finite diagram $F: J \to C$. 

There are several well known reductions of this concept to classes of special limits. For example, a category is finitely complete if and only if 

* It admits all finite products and equalizers. 

* It admits all (finite, or even binary) pullbacks and a terminal object.
