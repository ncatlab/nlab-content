A **finitely complete category** is a [[category]] $C$ which admits all finite [[limit|limits]], that is a limit for any finite [[diagram]] $F: J \to C$. 

There are several well known reductions of this concept to classes of special limits. For example, a category is finitely complete if and only if:

* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all binary [[product|products]] and [[equalizer|equalizers]]; or
* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all binary [[pullback|pullbacks]].
