Given a [[set]] $S$, the __identity function__ on $S$ is the [[function]] $id_S: S \to S$ that maps any element $x$ of $S$ to itself:
$$ id_S = (x \mapsto x) = \lambda x.\; x .$$

The identity functions are the [[identity morphisms]] in the category [[Set]] of sets.

More generally, in any [[concrete category]], the identity morphism of each object is given by the identity function on its underlying set.
