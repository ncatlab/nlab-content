## Definition

Given a [[set]] $S$, the __identity function__ on $S$ is the [[function]] $id_S\colon S \to S$ that maps any element $x$ of $S$ to itself:
$$ id_S = (x \mapsto x) = \lambda x.\; x ;$$
or equivalently,
$$ id_S(x) = x .$$

The identity functions are the [[identity morphisms]] in the category [[Set]] of sets.

More generally, in any [[concrete category]], the identity morphism of each object is given by the identity function on its [[underlying set]].

### In dependent type theory

In [[dependent type theory]], the identity function on a [[type]] $T$ is defined in the same way, as 
$$\mathrm{id}_T \coloneqq \lambda(t:T).t:T \to T$$

##Â Properties

\begin{theorem}
For all [[elements]] $x:T$, the [[fiber]] of the identity function $\lambda(t:T).t:T \to T$ at $x$ is a [[contractible type]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The [[fiber]] of the identity function $\lambda(t:T).t:T \to T$ at $x$ is the dependent type 
$$\sum_{y:T} (\lambda(t:T).t)(y) =_T x$$
By the [[computation rule]] of [[function types]], the term $(\lambda(t:T).t)(x)$ reduces down to $x$, and the fiber type becomes
$$\sum_{y:T} y =_T x$$
This is always a [[contractible type]]: 

* the [[center of contraction]] is given by the [[dependent pair]] $(x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))$

* for any $z:\sum_{y:T} y =_T x$, there is an [[identification]] 

$$z =_{\sum_{y:T} y =_T x} (x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))$$

By induction on [[dependent sum types]], it suffices to construct an identification 
$$(w, p) =_{\sum_{y:T} y =_T x} (x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))$$
for any $w:T$ and $p:w =_T x$, and by induction on [[identity types]], it suffices to construct an identification 
$$(x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x)) =_{\sum_{y:T} y =_T x} (x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))$$
but that's just reflexivity on $(x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))$
$$\mathrm{refl}_{\sum_{y:T} y =_T x}((x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))):(x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x)) =_{\sum_{y:T} y =_T x} (x, \mathrm{refl}_T(x))$$

Thus, for all $x:T$, the [[fiber]] of the identity function $\lambda(t:T).t:T \to T$ at $x$ is contractible. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The [[identity function]] on a type $T$ is an [[equivalence of types]]. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By definition of an equivalence of types. 
\end{proof}

Hence, in [[dependent type theory]], the identity function is also called the **identity equivalence**. 

Since the identity function is an equivalence of types, it has an [[inverse function]]. 

\begin{theorem}
The [[inverse function]] of the identity function is the identity function itself. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
...
\end{proof}
