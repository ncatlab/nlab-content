## Idea

A **strict $\omega$-groupoid** or **strict $\infty$-groupoid**is a [[strict ∞-category]] in which all [[k-morphism]]s have a strict [[inverse]] for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$

By a result by Brown and Higgins, going back to insights by Whitehead, $\omega$-groupoids are equivalently modeled by [[crossed complex]]es.

Strict $\infty$-groupoids form one of the vertices of the [[cosmic cube]] of [[higher category theory]].

## $(\infty,1)$-Category of strict $\infty$-groupoids

There is a [[model structure on strict ∞-groupoids]]. 

This should [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞Grpd]] on strict $\infty$-groupoids.
