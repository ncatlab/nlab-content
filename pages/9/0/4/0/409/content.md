## Idea

A _strict $\omega$-groupoid_ is an [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic model]] for certain simple [[homotopy types]]/[[∞-groupoids]] based on [[globular sets]]. It is almost like a [[chain complex]] of [[abelian groups]] (under [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]) except that the [[fundamental group]] is allowed, more generally, to be non-abelian and to act on all the other [[homotopy groups]]. In fact, strict $\omega$-groupoids are [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] to [[crossed complexes]].

## Definition

A **strict $\omega$-groupoid** or **strict $\infty$-groupoid** is a [[strict ∞-category]] in which all [[k-morphisms]] have a strict [[inverse]] for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$

Equivalently, it is a [[globular set]] $X_\bullet$ equipped with a [[unit law|unital]] and [[associativity|associative]] [[composition]] in each degree such that for all pairs of degrees $(k_1 \lt k_2)$ it induces on the 2-graph $X_{k_2} \stackrel{\to}{\to} X_{k_1} \stackrel{\to}{\to} X_0$ the structure of a [[strict 2-groupoid]]. 

## Properties

### Relation to crossed complexes

Due to an insight going back to [[George Whitehead]], written out in [Brown-Higgins-](#BrownHiggins), the [[1-category]] of strict $\omega$-groupoids is equivalentl to that of [[crossed complexes]]. This equivalence is a generalization of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to which it redruces when restricted to crossed complexes whose fundamental group is abelian and acts trivially. More details in this are at _[[Nonabelian Algebraic Topology]]_.

Strict $\infty$-groupoids form one of the vertices of the [[cosmic cube]] of [[higher category theory]].

### Model structure

There is a [[model structure on strict ∞-groupoids]]. 

This should [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞Grpd]] on strict $\infty$-groupoids.
