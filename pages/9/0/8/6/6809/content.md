## Idea

A 4d [[TQFT]] obtained by a "topological twist" from 4d [[super Yang-Mills theory]]. Its [[S-duality]] is supposed to encode, as a special case [[geometric Langlands duality]].

Upon compactification down to 2d it reproduces, at certain parameters, the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]].

## Related concepts

* [[geometric Langlands duality]]

* [[A-model]], [[B-model]]
