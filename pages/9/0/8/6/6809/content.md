## Idea

The _Kapustin-Witten TQFT_ is the [[4d TQFT]] obtained by  [[topologically twisted super Yang-Mills theory|topological twisting]] from  [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] on a 4-dimensional manifold of the form $M=\Sigma\times C$, where $\Sigma$ is a Riemann surface possibly with boundary and $C$ is a Riemann surface of genus $g\geq 2$. Its [[S-duality]] is supposed to encode, as a special case, [[geometric Langlands duality]] for the Riemann surface $C$.

Upon [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] on $C$ (i.e. $C$ is taken to be much smaller than $\Sigma$) down to 2d the resulting effective field theory on $\Sigma$ reproduces, at certain parameters, the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] whose target as a [[sigma model]] is the Hitchin moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{H}(G)$, where $G$ is the gauge group of the theory. 

S-duality manifests as mirror symmetry between $\mathcal{M}_{H}(G)$ and $\mathcal{M}_{H}({}^{L}G)$ where ${}^{L}G$ is the Langlands dual group of $G$.
