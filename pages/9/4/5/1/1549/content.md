A class $I$ of [[object]]s in a [[cartesian closed category]] $C$ is called an **exponential ideal** if whenever $Y\in I$ and $X\in C$, the [[exponential object]] $Y^X$ is in $I$.  Of course, in particular this implies that $I$ is itself cartesian closed.

If $I$ is a [[reflective subcategory]], then it is an exponential ideal if and only if its [[reflector]] $C\to I$ preserves finite [[product]]s (see A4.3.1 in the [[Elephant]]).
