##Overview##

Quillen's small object argument is a method for constructing functorial [[weak factorization system|weak factorization systems]] that are **cofibrantly generated** by a set of maps $I$. To say that a weak factorization system is cofibrantly generated by $I$ is to say that the right class of the system consists of precisely those maps which have the right lifting property with respect to $I$. The left class is then necessarily the class of maps who have the left lifting property with respect to the right class. 

When a weak factorization system is cofibrantly generated, another consequence of Quillen's small object argument is that the left class is the smallest [[saturated class of maps]] containing $I$.

Given that the classes of a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system are determined by lifting properties, the content of the small object argument is to produce the required factorizations. With care, this construction is _functorial_, so the result is a functorial weak factorization system.

The domains of the maps in $I$ are required to satisfy a smallness condition that says that any morphism from these objects to a sufficiently-large-directed colimit will factor through the base of the colimiting diagram.

##The Construction##

Given a morphism $f: X \rightarrow Y$, we would like to factor $f$ as $a : X \rightarrow Z$ followed by $q : Z \rightarrow Y$, where $q$ has the right lifting property with respect to all arrows in $I$. The arrow $a$ will be constructed to be a transfinite composite of pushouts of coproducts of maps in $i$. The left class of a weak factorization system is closed under all of these constructions, so $a$ will be in the left class cofibrantly generated by $i$.

For convenience, suppose our category is locally small. We can then consider the set $S_1$ of lifting problems between $f$ (on the right) and elements $i \in I$ (on the left). Form a coproduct over $S_1$ of the corresponding elements of $I$; the squares of $S_1$ then specify a canonical map from the domain of this morphism to $Z_0:=X$. The pushout of this diagram defines an object $Z_1$ and morphisms $a_1 : Z_0 \rightarrow Z_1$ and $q_1 : Z_1 \rightarrow Y$ factoring $f$. Intuitively, we have formed $Z_1$ by spheres for every attaching map from a domain of $I$ into $X=Z_0$.

Now, we iterate this construction with $q_1 : Z_1 \rightarrow Y$ in place of $f$ and taking colimits to construct $Z_{\alpha}$ for limit ordinals $\alpha$.  This construction does not converge, so we choose instead to stop at a sufficiently large ordinal $\beta$, chosen so that the domains of the maps in $I$ will satisfy the smallness property described above. Define $a$ to be the transfinite composite of the $a_{\alpha}$ and $q$ to be the induced map from the colimit $Z_{\beta}$ to $Y$.

It is clear from the construction that $a$ is in the left class of the weak factorization system, so it remains to show that $q$ has the right lifting property with respect to each $i \in I$. Given a lifting problem, the map from dom $i$ to dom $q$ factors through some $Z_{\alpha}$ by the smallness property. Because $Z_{\alpha+1}$ was defined to be a pushout over squares including this one, we have a map cod $i \rightarrow Z_{\alpha +1} \rightarrow Z_{\beta} =$ colim $Z_{\alpha}$, which is the desired lift.

###A note on Functoriality###

In order for the aforementioned construction to be _functorial_ we must be a bit careful. First, we must choose all of our colimits in advance and secondly, we must take care to terminate the construction at the same ordinal $\beta$ each time.
