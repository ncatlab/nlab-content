This article is the origin of the notion of [[Chern-Simons forms]] and their conception as [[secondary characteristic classes]], which led to the refinement of the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] by [[Cheeger-Simons differential characters]]. 

This is also where _[[Chern-Simons theory]]_ derives its name from.
