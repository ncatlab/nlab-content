A **cubical object** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[functor]]

$$
  F : \Box^{op} \to C
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of the [[cube category]] $\Box$ into $C$.

If $C = Set$ then this is called a [[cubical set]].

Functors 

$$
  F : \Box \to C
$$


from the cube category itself are **co-cubical object**s in $C$.

See also [[simplicial object]].
