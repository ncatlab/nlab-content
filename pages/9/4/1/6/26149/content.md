## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], a **strict singleton** or a **strict contractible type** is a pointed [[strict proposition]], or equivalently a strict proposition which is also a [[singleton]] or [[contractible type]]. In dependent type theories where [[strict propositions]] instead of [[h-propositions]] are used to represent the [[predicate logic]] of the type theory, strict singletons represent the notion of *[[truth]]* in the theory. 

## Examples

* The strict [[unit type]] with judgmental [[computation rules]] is a strict singleton. 

* The [[squash type]] of any [[pointed type]] is a strict singleton.

##Â Related concepts

* [[judgmental equality]]

* [[strict proposition]]
