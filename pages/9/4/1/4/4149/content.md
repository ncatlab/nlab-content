## Idea 

Resultant of two monic polynomials is an expression which is zero if the polynomials have a common multiple: it may be defined as a product of all possible difference between the pairs of roots of the two polynomials. They are an analogue of a discriminant of a single quadratic equation: the discriminant is zero if the equation has a double root. 

There are generalizations for more than 2 polynomials but in general they are purely understood. There are remarkable determinant expressions for resultants of 2 or 3 polynomials. In what is the first article on [[homological algebra]], Cayley has shown how to descibe a resultant as a determinant of a complex which is a certain Koszul resolution. 

While syzygies show linear relations, linear relations among linear relations and so on and thus belong to linear homological algebra, resultants seem to point to a nonlinear homological algebra for polynomial relations among polynomials and so on.
