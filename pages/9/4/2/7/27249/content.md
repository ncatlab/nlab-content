## Idea

Coalgebroid is a horizontal categorification of a coalgebra. The concept may be introduced in various levels of generality.

> We explain a theorem of D. Schäppi on the reconstruction of an affine category scheme (dually, a coalgebroid) over a general commutative ring from its category of finite-rank representations.
