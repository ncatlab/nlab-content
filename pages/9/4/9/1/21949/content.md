## Idea

The **propositional axiom of choice** is simply another name for the usual [[axiom of choice]] in [[dependent type theory]], to distinguish with the untruncated version of the axiom of choice called the *[[type theoretic axiom of choice]]*. 

It corresponds to the *[[internal axiom of choice]]* in [[categorical semantics]] and in [[set theory]]. 

##Â Statement

The propositional axiom of choice is the statement that given types $A$ and $B$ and type family $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$, one can construct

$$\mathrm{ac}_R:\left(\prod_{x:A} \exists y:B.R(x, y)\right) \to \left(\exists f:A \to B.\prod_{x:A} R(x, f(x))\right)$$

The [[propositions as subsingletons]] interprets [[disjunction]] and [[existential quantification]] as the [[bracket type]] of the [[sum type]] and [[dependent sum type]] respectively, and leads to the usual statement of the axiom of choice translated to [[dependent type theory]]. 

The equivalent form of the axiom of choice involving a unary type family $x:A \vdash P(x)$ instead of a binary type family $x:A, y:B \vdash R(x, y)$ states that one can construct

$$\mathrm{ac}_R:\left(\prod_{x:A} [P(x)]\right) \to \left[\prod_{x:A} P(x)\right]$$

This is the statement that any [[dependent product]] of any [[family]] of [[inhabited]] [[h-sets]] is [[inhabited]].
