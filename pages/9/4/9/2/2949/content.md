## Idea

When in a [[convenient category of topological spaces]], e.g. [[compactly generated space]]s, the category is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], so that there is an [[adjunction]] between the mapping space and the cartesian product in that category.  For general [[topological space]]s there is no globally defined adjunction, but we can instead characterize exactly which spaces are exponentiable.

## Exponentiable spaces

For $C$ a [[finitely complete category|category with finite products]], recall that an object $c$ is **[[exponentiable object|exponentiable]]** if the functor $c \times -: C \to C$ has a [[right adjoint]], usually denoted $(-)^c: C \to C$.

###### Theorem (Exponentiability) 
Let [[Top]] be the category of all topological spaces. An object $X$ of $Top$ is exponentiable if and only if $X$ satisfies either of these equivalent conditions:

* $X \times -: Top \to Top$ preserves [[coequalizer]]s, or equivalently [[quotient space]]s.  This functor always preserves [[coproducts]], so this condition is equivalent to saying that $X \times -$ preserves all small [[colimits]]. This is equivalent to exponentiability by the [[adjoint functor theorem]].

* $X$ is **core-compact**: for every open neighborhood $U$ of a point $x$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that for every open cover of $U$, there exists a finite subcover of $V$.  This is a theorem of point-set topology, not abstract nonsense like the previous condition.
=--

We write $V\ll U$ to mean that any open cover of $U$ admits a finite subcover of $V$; this is read as **$V$ is relatively compact under $U$** or **$V$ is way below $U$**.  Thus $X$ is core-compact iff every open set is a union of the subsets that are way below it.  If $X$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then core-compactness is equivalent to [[locally compact space|local compactness]]; thus in particular all locally compact Hausdorff spaces are exponentiable.  Note that core-compactness is also called **quasi local compactness**.

When $X$ is core-compact, we can explicitly describe the exponential topology on $Y^X$ (whose points are continuous maps $f: X \to Y$).  It is generated by [[topological basis|subbasis]] elements $O_{U,V}$, for $U$ an open subset of $X$ and $V$ an open subset of $Y$, where a continuous map $f\colon X \to Y$ belongs to $O_{U,V}$ iff $U\ll f^{-1}(V)$:

$$ O_{U, V} = \{f \in Y^X: U \ll f^{-1}(V)\} .$$

If $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff, then this topology on $Y^X$ coincides with the [[compact-open topology]].

Further remarks should be made which connect this to the theory of [[continuous lattice]]s (essentially, a space is exponentiable if its topology is a continuous lattice). 

## General exponential laws

If $X$ is exponentiable, then the exponential law gives us an isomorphism of *sets* $Map(Y,B^X) \cong Map(X\times Y,B)$ for any other spaces $B$ and $Y$.  If $Y$ is also exponentiable, then the [[Yoneda lemma]] yields from this a homeomorphism $B^{X\times Y} \cong (B^X)^Y$.  However, we can also say some things in general without all spaces involved being exponentiable.

We now agree to denote by $Map(X,Y)=X^Y$ the space of continuous maps $X\to Y$ in the [[compact-open topology]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem (Exponential law)
Let
$X,Y,B$ be [[topological spaces]]. For any $f\in B^{X\times Y}$,
the formula
$$
[(\theta f)(y)](x) = f(x,y)
$$
defines a [[continuous map]] $\theta f:Y\to B^X$
which we call the map adjoint to $f$, or the [[adjunct]] of $f$.

The adjunction map
$$
\theta : Map(X\times Y,B)\to Map(Y,B^X), \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\theta:f\mapsto \theta f
$$
is a [[one-to-one function]], and if $X$ is [[locally compact space|locally compact and Hausdorff]] then $\theta$ is a [[bijection]].
Independently from that assumption on $X$, if $Y$ is
[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then $\theta$ is continuous in the [[compact-open topology]]
$$
\theta : B^{X\times Y}\to (B^X)^Y.
$$

If both assumptions (on $X$ and $Y$) are satisfied, then
$\theta$ is not only a continuous bijection, but also open, hence a [[homeomorphism]].

## Based exponential laws

There is also a version for based (= [[pointed space|pointed]]) topological spaces. The [[cartesian product]] then needs to be replace by the [[smash product]] of the based spaces. Regarding that the maps preserve the base point, the adjunction map $\theta$ induces the adjunction map

 $$\theta_*:Map_*(X\wedge Y,B)\to Map_*(Y,B^X)$$

where the mapping space $Map_*$ for based spaces is the subspace of the usual mapping space, in the compact-open topology, which consists of the mappings preserving the base point. 

It appears that $\theta_*$ is again one-to-one and continuous, and it is bijective if $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff. If $Y$ is also Hausdorff then $\theta_*$ is a homeomorphism.
