## Idea

The *Fisher metric* is a [[Riemannian metric]] appearing in [[information geometry]]. 

Quantum variants include the *Bures metric* and the *quantum Fisher information matrix*.

Most references about Fisher metric are at [[information geometry]], here we add few on quantum and $C^*$-algebraic analogues.

For singular statistical models (including those arising in [[machine learning]]) one needs more version of Fisher metric beyond manifolds; one possibility is in the framework of [[diffeologies]],

>  In this paper, first, we survey the concept of diffeological Fisher metric and its naturality, using functorial language of probability morphisms, and slightly extending Lê's theory in (Le2020) to include weakly $C^k$-diffeological statistical models. Then we introduce the resulting notions of the diffeological Fisher distance, the diffeological Hausdorff--Jeffrey measure and explain their role in classical and Bayesian nonparametric estimation problems in statistics.
