Fisher metric is a metric appearing in [[information geometry]], see there for more information and references. There are also several quantum versions. One is the Bures metric and another is quantum Fisher information matrix.

Most references about Fisher metric are at [[information geometry]], here we add few on quantum and $C^*$-algebraic analogues.

For singular statistical models (including those arising in [[machine learning]]) one needs more version of Fisher metric beyond manifolds; one possibility is in the framework of [[diffeologies]],

>  In this paper, first, we survey the concept of diffeological Fisher metric and its naturality, using functorial language of probability morphisms, and slightly extending Lê's theory in (Le2020) to include weakly $C^k$-diffeological statistical models. Then we introduce the resulting notions of the diffeological Fisher distance, the diffeological Hausdorff--Jeffrey measure and explain their role in classical and Bayesian nonparametric estimation problems in statistics.
