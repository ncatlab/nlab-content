Fisher metric is a metric appearing in [[information geometry]], see there for more information and references. There are also several quantum versions. One is the Bures metric and another is quantum Fisher information matrix.

Most references about Fisher metric are at [[information geometry]], here we add few on quantum and $C^*$-algebraic analogues.
