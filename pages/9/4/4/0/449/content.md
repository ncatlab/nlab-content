(roughly)

An algebraically defined [[higher category theory|higher category]] is a cellular set, usually a [[globular set]] or a [[cubical set]] equipped with the _structure_ of chosen composition maps, identity maps, and usually, in the case of weak $\infty$-categories, their higher coherent structure maps (associators, pentagonators, unitors, etc ).

This is to be contrasted the the [[geometric definition of higher category]] where all these operations are replaced instead by _relations_ (for instance instead of a specified composite there is just the guarantee for the existence of a composite).

The main examples of algebraically defined higher categories are all flavors of [[omega-category|omega-categories]] as well as [[n-fold category|n-fold categories]].

(somebody please add pointers to and discussion of the [[Todd Trimble|Trimble]]-definition of weak higher category).
