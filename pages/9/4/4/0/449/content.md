# Idea #

An algebraically defined [[higher category theory|higher category]] consists of some sort of [[geometric shapes for higher structures|geometric data]], usually a [[globular set]] or a [[cubical set]], equipped with the _structure_ of chosen composition maps, identity maps, and usually, in the case of weak $\infty$-categories, their higher coherent structure maps (associators, pentagonators, unitors, etc ).

This is to be contrasted with the [[geometric definition of higher category]] where all these operations are replaced instead by _properties_ (for instance instead of a specified composite there is just the guarantee for the existence of a composite).

# Examples #

* The usual definition of a [[category|1-category]] is algebraic, although there are equivalent nonalgebraic ones.

* Likewise, the usual notions of [[strict n-category]] and [[strict omega-category]] are algebraic.

* [[n-fold category|n-fold categories]] are also algebraically defined.

* [[bicategory|Bicategories]], [[tricategory|tricategories]], and [[tetracategory|tetracategories]] are algebraic notions of weak $2$-categories through $4$-categories.

* The [[Michael Batanin|Batanin]]/[[Tom Leinster|Leinster]] approach to higher categories involves algebraic structure imposed all at once (using higher [[operad|operads]]) on a globular set. See [[Batanin omega-category]].

* The [[Todd Trimble|Trimble]]/[[Peter May|May]] approach to higher categories involves algebraic structure imposed in stages by a process of iterative enrichment. See also [[Trimble n-category]].
