## Definition

A **constant stack** is a [[stack]] that is equivalent to the [[stackification]] of a presheaf that is constant (as a [[functor]]).

This is part of a larger pattern:

* A [[locally constant function]] is a section of a [[constant sheaf]].

* A [[locally constant sheaf]] is a section of a constant stack.

* A [[locally constant ∞-stack]] is a section of a [[constant ∞-stack]].
