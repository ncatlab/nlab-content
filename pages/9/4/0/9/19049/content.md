## Idea

The _store comonad_ (also _costate comonad_) is a co[[monad (in computer science)]] used to implement computational storage and retrieval of data in [[functional programming]].

As a comonadic triple $(D,\varepsilon,\delta)$ it is given by an [[endofunctor]],
$$
D X : X \rightarrow W \times [W,X],
$$
with [[natural transformations]] the counit,
$$
\varepsilon : D X \rightarrow X 
$$
$$
\varepsilon(v,f) \mapsto f(v),
$$
usually called **extract** and comultiplication,
$$
\delta: D X \rightarrow D D X
$$
$$
\delta (s, v) \mapsto (s, \lambda  s' . (s', v)),
$$ 

simply called **duplicate**.
## Properties

### Realization in dependent type theory

In a [[locally Cartesian closed category]]/[[dependent type theory]] $\mathbf{H}$, then to every type $W$ is associated its [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_W}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{W^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_W}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

In terms of this the store comonad is the composite

$$
  Store = \sum_W W^\ast \prod_W W^\ast 
$$

of [[context extension]], followed by [[dependent product]] , followed by [[context extension]], followed by [[dependent sum]].

Here $\prod_W W^\ast = [W,-]$ is called the _[[function monad]]_ or _[[reader monad]]_ and $\sum_W W^\ast = W \times (-)$ is the _[[writer comonad]]_.
