## Definition

In a [[strictly weakly ordered ring]] $R$, the natural numbers are a subset of $R$, because every strictly weakly ordered ring has [[characteristic zero]]. A number or element $a \in R$ is an **infinite number** or an **infinite element** if for all natural numbers $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \lt a$. 

Examples of rings with infinite numbers include the [[hyperreal numbers]] and the [[surreal numbers]]. 

A strictly weakly ordered ring $R$ which satisfies the [[archimedean property]] has no infinite numbers.
