_Stone Spaces_ (1982) is a monograph by [[Peter Johnstone]] (later author of the [[Elephant]]).  Ostensibly about the [[Stone representation theorem]], it may be best known as a reference for using [[locales]] in place of [[topological spaces]].

Although it is a work of [[mathematics]] rather than [[foundations|metamathematics]], it shows clearly by example how (usually) results about locales do not require the [[axiom of choice]] even when analogous results about topological spaces do.  [[Paul Taylor]] has somewhat jocularly written
>In [Joh82] the public theorems about topology are marked with an asterisk, although the official meaning of that symbol is a dependence on the axiom of choice.
([ASD I](http://www.monad.me.uk/ASD/dedras/), page 3).  Unfortunately for [[constructive mathematics|constructive mathematicians]], [[excluded middle]] is *not* considered a form of choice.


## Contents

Besides the usual prefaces, bibliography, and indexes, there is a historical introduction, and each chapter concludes with notes on historical and metamathematical aspects.  Otherwise, each of 7 chapters is divided into 4 sections, which in turn contain paragraphs that deal with essentially one idea each:
