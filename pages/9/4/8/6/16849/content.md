A **bipartite graph** is a [[graph]] $G$ equipped with a [[vertex coloring|2-coloring]] of its vertices, i.e., equipped with a graph homomorphism $f : G \to K_2$.

This is really what you want ? Normally, being bipartite is property of a graph not a structure. As you define it it amounts to being an object in $Grph/K_2$. This might be an ([[étendue]]) topos, presumably equivalent to the slice over $K_2$ of the topos of involutory directed graphs, cf. a related construction in Lawvere 1986 .
