In a [[closed category]] $C$ (for instance a [[closed monoidal category]]) for any two objects $X,Y$ there is an object $hom(X,Y)$ representing the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. This is called the **internal hom**, expressing the idea that this the perspective on the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ from the inside of $C$.

You can distinguish this from the external [[hom-set]] $Hom(x,y)$.  Note that if $I$ is the unit object of the closed category $C$, then
$$Hom(I,hom(x,y)) \cong Hom(x,y)$$
given by a [[natural isomorphism]].

More generally, if $C$ is an [[enriched category]], you get a [[hom-object]].
