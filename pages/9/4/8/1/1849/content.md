The [[physical field|field]] content of standard $11$-dimensional [[supergravity]] consists of ---besides the [[gravitational field]] and the various fermionic [[superpartner]]s--- a field that is locally modeled by a differential $3$-[[differential form|form]]. 

Given that 

* an ordinary [[connection on a bundle|connection]] form is often denoted by the symbol $A$ and
* the local $2$-form of the [[Kalb–Ramond field]] is usually denoted by the symbol $B$,

this $3$-form is usually denoted by the letter $C$ and just called "the $C$ field".

In complete analogy to how

* quantum particles couple to the [[electromagnetic field]] and
* quantum [[string theory|strings]] couple to the [[Kalb–Ramond field]],

so $(2+1)$-dimensional extended objects, quantum "mem[[branes]]", couple to the $C$-field. By the entirely same Dirac quantization argument described at [[electromagnetic field]] and [[Kalb–Ramond field]], this alone implies already that the $C$ field is a degree-$3$ [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne]] [[differential cohomology|differential cocycle]].

Moreover, a phenomenon closely related to the [[Green–Schwarz mechanism]] implies that the $C$-field is not an arbitrary degree-$3$ diffential cocycle, but the difference of two Chern--Simons differential cocycles, in that the curvature characteristic $4$-form is constrained to be in the de Rham cohomology class of the first Pontryagin characteristic class of the tangent bundle of the underlying space.
