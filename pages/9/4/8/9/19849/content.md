## Idea

A **two-valued topos** is a topos with exactly two [[truth value|truth values]].



## Definition

A topos $\mathcal{E}$ is called _two-valued_ if its [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ has precisely two global elements $1\overset{true}{\to}\Omega$ and $1\overset{false}{\to}\Omega$.


## Properties

* In particular, a two-valued topos $\mathcal{E}$ is consistent i.e. $\mathcal{E}\neq 1$.

* Since $\Omega$ classifies subobjects $X\subseteq 1$, these correspond precisely to global elements $1\overset{\chi_X}{\to}\Omega$ whence a topos $\mathcal{E}$ is two-valued precisely if the [[terminal object]] $1$ has exactly the two subobjects $0$ and $1$.

* Two-valued toposes are [[connected topos|connected]] i.e. $0\neq 1$ and $U\coprod V\cong 1$ implies $U\cong 1$ and $V\cong 0$ or vice versa. This holds because $U$, $V$ are disjoint subobjects of $U\coprod V\cong 1$ but $1$ has only the two trivial subobjects.

* Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a [[geometric theory]] over the signature $\Sigma$. Then $\mathbb{T}$ is called [[complete theory|complete]] if every geometric sentence $\varphi$ over $\Sigma$ is $\mathbb{T}$-provably equivalent to either $\top$ or $\bottom\; ,$ but not both. A geometric theory $\mathbb{T}$ is complete precisely iff its [[classifying topos]] $Set[\mathbb{T}]$ is two-valued (Caramello [2012](#Ca12), remark 2.5).

* Being two-valued is different from saying that $\Omega\cong 1\coprod 1$: The latter property characterizes [[Boolean topos|Boolean toposes]] but a Boolean topos is not necessarily two-valued - the easist consistent example possibly being $Set\times Set$ which is four-valued, more complicated ones often arising in intermediates steps in set-theoretic [[forcing]] (cf. [[continuum hypothesis]]). There exists a general _filter quotient construction_ turning a Boolean topos into a two-valued Boolean topos (cf. Mac Lane-Moerdijk [1994](#MM94), pp.256ff, 274). 

## Examples

* Though the  forcing models resulting from the above mentioned filter-quotient construction provide a plethora of examples of Boolean two-valued toposes other than $Set$, two-valued toposes are by no means bound to be Boolean. 

* In fact, there exists a rich supply of two-valued toposes that are not Boolean provided by the **toposes of actions of monoids** $M$:  Since the underlying set of $\Omega$ consists of all right ideals of $M$ with $m\in M$ acting on a right ideal $I$ by mapping it to $I\cdot m=\{x\in M|m\cdot x\in I\}\;,$ a global element picks out a right ideal $J$ that satisfies $J\cdot y= J$ for all $y\in M$, inheriting by equivariance the triviality of the action on $1$ with underlying set a singleton, which implies $J=\empty$ or $J=M$, the latter since $j\in J$ entails $1\in J\cdot j=J\;.$ Whence $Set^{M^{op}}$ is two-valued but it is a well known excercise that $Set^{M^{op}}$ is Boolean precisely iff $M$ is a group.
