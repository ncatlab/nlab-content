## Idea 

A notion of [[precategory]] which uses the [[equivalence relation]] of [[setoids]] rather than the [[identity type]] of [[h-sets]]. 

## Definition

In [[intensional type theory]], a **(2,1)-preorder** or **locally setoidal prebicategory** $\mathcal{C}$ consists of 

* a [[type]] of [[objects]] $Ob(\mathcal{C})$, 
* for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $B:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a [[setoid]] $(Hom(A, B), \equiv_{Hom(A, B)})$ of [[morphisms]]
* for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, $B:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and $C:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a [[binary function]] 
$$(-)\circ_{A, B, C}(-) :Hom(B, C) \times Hom(A, B) \to Hom(A, C)$$
which preserves the setoid equivalence relation
* for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a morphism $\mathrm{id}_A:Hom(A, A)$
* such that 
  * the composition of morphisms is [[associative]]: for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, $B:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, $C:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and $D:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and for each morphism $f:Hom(A, B)$, $g:Hom(B, C)$, and $h:Hom(C, D)$, 
$$h \circ_{A, C, D} (g \circ_{A, B, C} f) \equiv_{Hom(A, D)} h \circ_{B, C, D} (g \circ_{A, B, D} f)$$
  * the composition of morphisms satisfies the left and right [[unit laws]]: for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $B :Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and morphism $f:Hom(A, B)$, $\mathrm{id}_B \circ_{A, B, B} f \equiv_{Hom(A, B)} f$ and $f \circ_{A, A, B} \mathrm{id}_A \equiv_{Hom(A, B)} f$.

The latter two axioms are actually inhabitants of the [[equivalence relation]], hence are data included in the definition just like the first four.  However, by definition elements of an equivalence relations are (typally) unique whenever they exist, so in most cases their presence as data can be ignored.

## Properties

A (2,1)-preorder is **locally univalent** or a **[[precategory]]** if for all objects $A$ and $B$ and morphisms $f:Hom(A, B)$ and $g:Hom(A, B)$ the canonical function 
$$idtoequivrel(A, B, f, g):f =_{Hom(A, B)} g \to f \equiv_{Hom(A, B)} g$$ 
is an equivalence. In a [[univalent type theory]], every setoid is a set and thus every (2,1)-preorder is a precategory. 

An isomorphism in a (2,1)-preorder is a morphism $f:Hom(A, B)$ with a morphism $g:Hom(B, A)$ such that $g \circ f \equiv_{Hom(A, A)} id_A$ and $f \circ g \equiv_{Hom(B, B)} id_B$. The type of all isomorphisms between $A$ and $B$ is represented by $A \cong_{Ob(\mathcal{C})} B$ and is also a setoid. 

A (2,1)-preorder is **globally univalent** if for all objects $A$ and $B$ the canonical function 
$$idtoiso(A, B):A =_{Ob(\mathcal{C})} B \to A \cong_{Ob(\mathcal{C})} B$$ 
reflects the equivalence relation and is an equivalence of types. 

A (2,1)-preorder is **univalent** or a **[[univalent category]]** if it is both locally univalent and globally univalent.
