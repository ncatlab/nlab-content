## Rank of a module

Let $A$ be a [[ring]] and $N$ a [[module]] over $A$. 

A collection of elements $(w_i)_{i \in I}$ of $N$ is called a [[basis]] of $N$ (over $A$) if for every $x \in N$ there is a unique collection $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ of elements of $A$ such that $a_i = 0$ for all but finitely many $i \in I$ and $x = \sum_{i \in I} a_i w_i$. 

If $N$ has a basis it is called _free_ (over $A$). If $A$ is not the zero ring and $N$ is free with basiss $(w_i)_{i \in I}$, then the [[cardinality]] $# I$ only depends on $N$, and not on the choice of basis. It is called the **rank** of $N$ over $A$, notation: $rank_A(M)$. If $N$ is a [[finitely generated]] free module then the rank is finite.
