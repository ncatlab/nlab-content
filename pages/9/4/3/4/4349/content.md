Given a functor 

$$F : C \to D \, , $$

we can think of the objects of $C$ as objects of $D$ equipped with extra **stuff**.  If $F$ is [[faithful]] we can think of the objects of $C$ as objects of $D$ equipped with extra [[structure]].  If $F$ is [[full]] and faithful we can think of the objects of $C$ as objects of $D$ equipped with extra [[property|properties]].  

This is why a functor between groupoids

$$ F : C \to core(FinSet) $$

is called a [[stuff type]].
