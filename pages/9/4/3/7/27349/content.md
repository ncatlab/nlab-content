## Statements

Every [[Stein manifold]] of dimension $n$ admits an injective proper holomorphic immersion into $\mathbf{C}^{2n+1}$.

Every holomorphically complete [[complex space]] of dimension $n$ admits an injective proper holomorphic map into $\mathbf{C}^{2n+1}$ that is an immersion at every uniformizable point. 

If for some $N\gt n$ a holomorphically complete [[complex space]] $X$ is locally isomorphic to an analytic subset of an open set in $\mathbf{C}^N$, then there is an injective proper holomorphic map $\phi\colon X\to\mathbf{C}^{N+n}$ that is an isomorphism onto its image.

The relevant spaces of embeddings are dense in the space of all holomorphic mappings into the corresponding cartesian spaces equipped with the compact convergence topology.
