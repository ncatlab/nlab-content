## Idea

The _Giry monad_ ([Giry 80](#Giry80), following [Lawvere 62](#Lawvere62)) is the [[monad]] on a [[category]] of suitable [[spaces]] which sends each suitable space $X$ to the space of suitable [[probability measures]] on $X$.

It is one of the main examples of a [[probability monad]], and hence one of the main structures used in [[categorical probability]].


## Definition

The *Giry monad* is defined on the category of [[measurable spaces]], assigning to each measurable space $X$ the space $G(X)$ of all [[probability measures]] on $X$ endowed with the [[sigma-algebra|$\sigma$-algebra]] generated by the set of all the [[evaluation maps]] 
$$
  ev_U \colon G(X) \to [0,1]
$$ 
sending a probability measure $P$ to $P(U)$, where $U$ ranges over all the measurable sets of $X$. The unit of the monad sends a point $x \in X$ to the [[Dirac measure]] at $x$, $\delta_x$, while the [[monad]]-multiplication is defined by the [[natural transformation]] 
$$
  \mu_{X}
  \;\colon\; 
  G\big(G(X)\big) 
  \longrightarrow 
  G(X)
$$

given by

$$
  \mu_X (Q)(U) 
  \;\coloneqq\; 
  \textstyle{\int}_{q \in G(X)} 
  ev_U(q) 
  \,dQ
  \,.
$$

This makes the [[endofunctor]] $G$ into a [[monad]], and as such this is the _Giry monad_ on measurable spaces, as originally defined by [Lawvere 1962](#Lawvere62).

An alternative choice, convenient for analysis purposes, and introduced by Giry, is obtained by restricting the category of [[measurable spaces]] to the (full) subcategory which are those measurable spaces generated by [[Polish spaces]], $Pol$, which are  separable [[metric spaces]] for which a complete metric exists.  The morphisms of this category are continuous functions.

Write 

$$
  P \colon Pol \to Pol
$$

for the [[endofunctor]] which sends a space, $X$, to the space of [[probability measures]] on the [[Borel subsets]] of $X$. $P(X)$ is equipped with the weakest [[topology]] which makes the [[integration]] map $\tau \mapsto \int_{X}f d\tau$ [[continuous function|continuous]] for any $f$, a bounded, continuous, real function on $X$. 

There is a [[natural transformation]] 

$$
  \mu_{X}: P(P(X)) \to P(X)
$$

given by

$$
 \mu_X (M)(A) := \int_{P(X)} \tau(A) M(d\tau).
$$

This makes the [[endofunctor]] $P$ into a [[monad]], and this is the _Giry monad_ on [[Polish spaces]].  

## Properties

### Kleisli category

The [[Kleisli morphisms]] of the Giry monad on [[Meas]] (and related subcategories) are [[Markov kernels]]. Therefore its [[Kleisli category]] is the category [[Stoch]]. 
It is one of the most important examples of a [[Markov category]].

### Algebras over the Giry monad
We can't say anything about the $G$-algebras on the category of measurable spaces due to lack of structure and set-theoretical issues.  However, we can analyze the $P$-algebras exploiting the continuous morphisms and countably dense subsets on the spaces $P{X}$, and give a class of non-free $P$-algebras.
   
If $X$ is any measurable space then the space of probability measures $P{X}$ is a convex space with the structure defined pointwise, i.e., if $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is a finite collection of probability measures on $X$  then, for every sequence $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ with each $p_i \in [0,1]$  the  affine sum  $\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i P_i$,  is also a probability measure, defined at the measurable set $U$ in $X$ by
\begin{equation}
\big(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i P_i\big)(U) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i P_i(U).
\end{equation}
On the otherhand, given any $P$-algebra $h: P{X} \rightarrow X$ it follows that $X$ can also be endowed with a convex structure by defining, for every affine sum of $n$ elements of $X$,
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i := h(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{x_i}).
\end{equation}

To analyze $P$-algebras, via the Eilenberg-Moore representation as morphisms $h:P{X} \rightarrow X$, we require

\begin{lemma} \label{FunThm} Given any $P$-algebra $h: P{X} \rightarrow X$ the continuous function $h$ is an affine map.  
Moreover, for any measurable space $Y$ and $P$-algebra $k:P{Y} \rightarrow Y$ on it,  if $f: (X, h) \rightarrow (Y, k)$ is a map of $P$-algebras then the continuous function $f$ is also affine.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}  Because a $P$-algebra $h$ must satisfy $h \circ \mu_X = h \circ P{h}$ we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
(h \circ \mu_X)( \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{Q_i}) &=& (h \circ P{h})( \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{Q_i}) \\
h( \sum_{i=1}^n p_i Q_i) &=& h(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \, \delta_{h(Q_i)}) \\
 &=& \sum_{i=1}^n p_i h(Q_i)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where the last line makes use of the definition of the convex structure on $X$.  Thus every $P$-algebra is affine.

To prove the map of $P$-algebras is an affine map we compute
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcll}
f(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i) &=& f(h(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{x_i})) &  \\
&=& k(P(f)(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{x_i}) &  \\
&=& k(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{f(x_i)}) &  \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n p_i f(x_i) & 
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

Remark: The space $P{X}$ actually has a superconvex structure since, for $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  \sum_{i=1}^n p_i=1$ and each $p_i \in [0,1]$,   the countable affine sum $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} p_i P_i$ also defines a probability measure on $P{X}$.  The preceding Lemma also then holds for the term "affine" replaced by "countably affine". 

\begin{lemma} (Uniqueness of $P$-algebras) Let $X$ be a Polish space and suppose $f,g:P{X} \rightarrow X$ are a pair of $P$-algebras.  Then $f=g$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}  
 The space $X$, being a separable metric space, has a countable dense subset  $E$, and hence  the set $D=\{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \delta_{e_i} \, | \, e_i\in \E, r_i \in \mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1],  \sum_{i=1}^n  r_i=1,  \text{ and } n  \text{ finite}\}$ is dense in $P{X}$.(Parthasarathy, Probability measures on metric spaces,Theorem 6.3)   Since the set $D$ is dense in $P{X}$ and $P{X}$ is a complete separable metric space it follows that the functions $f$ and $g$ are completely determined by their  values on the dense subset $D$.  We have $f(\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \delta_{e_i})= \sum_{i=1}^n r_i f(\delta_{e_i}) =  \sum_{i=1}^n r_i e_i$, where the first equality follows by Lemma \ref{FunThm}, and the second equality by the required condition on algebras, $h(\delta_e)=e$, and similiarly $g(\sum_{i=1}^n r_i \delta_{e_i}) = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i e_i.$  Since $f=g$ on the dense subset and both $f$ and $g$ are continuous maps it follows that $f=g$ on all of $P{X}$. 
\end{proof} 

\begin{lemma} \label{thm} Let $X$  be a Polish space and suppose $h:P{X} \rightarrow X$ is a $P$-algebra.  Then $h$ is a free $P$-algebra if and only if there exists a $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphism $\phi: X \rightarrow P{Y}$ for some Polish space $Y$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose there exists a $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphism $\phi: X \rightarrow P{Y}$ then $\hat{h} = \phi \circ h \circ P(\phi^{-1}): P(P{Y}) \rightarrow P{Y}$ is also a $P$-algebra.  Since the multiplication natural transformation $\mu: P \circ P \Rightarrow P$ gives the free $P$-algebra $\mu_Y: P(P{Y}) \rightarrow P{Y}$ it follows by the uniqueness lemma that $\hat{h}=\mu_Y$.  Because $\phi$ is a $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphism it then follows that $h$ is a free $P$-algebra.

Conversely, if $h$ is a free $P$-algebra then, since all free $P$-algebras are given by $\mu_Y: P(P{Y}) \rightarrow P{Y}$ for every space $Y$,  there must exists a particular space $Y$ such that $X = P{Y}$. Hence the identity map yields  a  $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphism  $id: X \rightarrow P{Y}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{L3}
The space $P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ is not $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphic to $P{X}$ for any Polish space $X$.
\end{lemma}
 \begin{proof}
Every element of $P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ is characterized precisely by two independent real numbers $r,s \in [0,1]$.
The only space $X$ for which every element $Q \in P{X}$ is characterized by two independent variables $r,s \in [0,1]$ is $P{\mathbf{3}}$. But clearly 
 $P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ is not $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphic to $P{\mathbf{3}}$. 

  \end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{marginal} (Marginalization $P$-algebra)  Let $\pi_i: P(\mathbf{2})\times P(\mathbf{2}) \rightarrow P(\mathbf{2})$, for $i=1,2$ denote  the two coordinate projection maps of the product space $P(\mathbf{2}) \times P(\mathbf{2})$.  The function $m:P( P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}) \rightarrow P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ specified by marginalization, $Q \mapsto \big( (\mu_2\circ  P{\pi_1})Q, (\mu_2 \circ P{\pi_2})Q\big)$, is a $P$-algebra.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} The function $m$ is continuous because each of the component maps are continuous.  The condition $m \circ \eta_{P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}} = id_{P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}}$ follows because for each element $(Q,R) \in P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ we have $\mu_2(G{\pi_1} \delta_{(Q,R)}) = \mu_2(\delta_{\pi_1(Q,R)}) = \mu_2(\delta_P)=Q$ and similarly $\mu_2(P{\pi_2} \delta_{(Q,R)}) =R$.

To prove the required condition $P{m} \circ m= \mu_{P{2} \times P{2}} \circ m$ first note that $m$ is an affine function because each component map $\mu_2 \circ P{\pi_i}$, for $i=1,2$, is a composite of affine maps. Moreover, since $P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ is a separable metric space it has a countable dense subset of elements $(u_k, v_k)$ so that the set of elements consisting of affine sums of Dirac measures of the form $\sum_{j=1}^p s_j \delta_{(u_j,v_j)}$ for $p$ a finite number  is a dense subset of $P(P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}})$.  In turn it follows that affine sums of elements of the form $\sum_{i=1}^n r_i  \delta_{\sum_{j=1}^p s_j^i \delta_{(u_j^i,v_j^i)}}$ specify a dense subset of $P(P(P(\mathbf{2}) \times P(\mathbf{2})))$.  A direct computation on the dense elements, using the fact that all the maps are affine, then yields $P{m} \circ m= \mu_{P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}} \circ m$ on all the elements of the dense set.  Since the maps are all continuous  it therefore follows that $P{m} \circ m= \mu_{P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}} \circ m$ on all elements of $P(P(P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}))$.  This completes the proof that $m$ is a $P$-algebra.

\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
The category of $P$-algebras  is not equivalent to the Kleisi category of the $P$-monad for Polish spaces.  In other words, there are non-free $P$-algebras.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{marginal} we know that the marginalization map  $m:P( P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}) \rightarrow P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ is a $P$-algebra.
By Lemma \ref{L3} we know that $P{\mathbf{2}} \times P{\mathbf{2}}$ is not $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphic to $P{Y}$ for any space $Y$. Hence by Lemma \ref{thm} it follows that $m$ is not a free $P$-algebra, and hence the category of $P$-algebras  is not equivalent to the Kleisi category for the $P$-monad.
\end{proof}
If Lemma \ref{L3} can be generalized to the statement that if the convex space $\prod_{i \in I}P(X_i)$, where $I$ is a countable indexing set, is not $\mathbf{Cvx}$-isomorphic to $P(Z)$ for any Polish space $Z$ then all the marginalization maps $m: P\big(\prod_{i \in I}P(X_i)\big) \rightarrow \prod_{i \in I}P(X_i)$ are non-free $P$-algebras. Those maps are obviously $P$-algebras by the argument used in Lemma \ref{marginal}.  

[Doberkat](http://ls10-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/index.php?id=18) gives a characterization of the $P$-algebras on Polish spaces as convex spaces which satisfy some basic properties. The transition between the Eilenberg-Moore(EM) representation and Doberkats representation is that given an EM $P$-algebra $h: P{X} \rightarrow X$ one obtains an induced convex space structure on $X$ by defining $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i := h(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \delta_{x_i})$ so that as a convex space  $P{X}$ modulo the equivalence relation specified by $h$ is isomorphic to the convex space $X$. The projection map $P{X}/h \rightarrow X$ is the function $h$ which is affine.  Conversely, given a Polish space $X$ such that there exists an equivalence relation $R$ on $P{X}$, partitioning it into equivalence classes such that the projection map $\pi:P{X} \rightarrow X$ satisfies some basic properties listed by Doberkat then $\pi$ is an EM $P$-algebra.

Doberkat points out that the countable discrete Polish spaces cannot be algebras because such spaces are disconnected, hence there can be no continuous map $P{\mathbf{n}} \rightarrow \mathbf{n}$.

### Voevodsky's work

[[Vladimir Voevodsky]] has also worked on a category theoretic treatment of [[probability theory]], and gave few talks on this at IHES, Miami, in Moscow etc. Voevodsky had in mind applications in [[mathematical biology]], for example, population genetics: 

See [Miami Talk abstract](http://www.math.miami.edu/anno/voevodsky.htm)

> ...a categorical study of probability theory where "categorical" is understood in the sense of category theory. Originally, I developed this approach to probability to get a better understanding of the constructions which I had to deal with in population genetics. Later it evolved into something which seems to be also interesting from a purely mathematical point of view. On the elementary level it gives a category which is useful for the work with probabilistic constructions involving complicated combinations of stochastic processes of different types. On a more advanced level, applying in this context the old idea of a functor as a generalized object one gets a better view of the relationship between probability and the theory of (pre-)ordered topological vector spaces.

> In early 60-ies Bill Lawvere defined a category whose objects are measurable spaces and morphisms are Markov kernels. I will try to show how this category allows one to think about many of the notions of probability theory in categorical terms and to connect probabilistic objects to objects of other types through various functors.

Voevodsky's unfinished [notes on categorical probability theory](http://www.math.ias.edu/Voevodsky/voevodsky-publications_abstracts.html#markov) have been released posthumously.

### Panangaden's monad

[[Prakash Panangaden]] in [Probabilistic Relations](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.52.4840) defines the [[category]] $SRel$ (stochastic [[relation]]s) to have as [[object]]s [[set]]s equipped with a $\sigma$[[sigma-field|-field]]. [[morphism|Morphisms]] are conditional probability densities or stochastic kernels. So, a morphism from $( X, \Sigma_X)$ to $( Y, \Sigma_Y)$ is a function $h: X \times \Sigma_Y \to [0, 1]$ such that 

1. $\forall B \in \Sigma_Y . \lambda x \in X . h(x, B)$ is a bounded measurable function,
1. $\forall x \in X . \lambda B \in \Sigma_Y . h(x, B)$ is a subprobability measure on $\Sigma_Y$.

If $k$ is a morphism from $Y$ to $Z$, then $k \cdot h$ from $X$ to $Z$ is defined as $(k \cdot h)(x, C) = \int_Y  k(y, C)h(x, d y)$.

Panangaden's definition differs from Giry's in the second clause where subprobability measures are allowed, rather than ordinary probability measures.

Panangaden emphasises that the mechanism is similar to the way that the category of relations can be constructed from the [[power set]] [[functor]]. Just as the category of relations is the [[Kleisli category]] of the powerset functor over the category of sets [[Set]], $SRel$ is the Kleisli category of the functor over the category of [[measurable space]]s and [[measurable function]]s which sends a measurable space, $X$, to the measurable space of sub[[probability measure]]s on $X$. This functor gives rise to a [[monad]].

What is gained by the move from probability measures to subprobability measures? One motivation seems to be to model probabilistic processes from $X$ to a [[coproduct]] $X + Y$. This you can iterate to form a process which looks to see where in $Y$ you eventually end up. This relates to $SRel$ being traced.

There is a [[monad]] on $MeasureSpaces$, $1 + -: Meas \to Meas$. A probability measure on $1 + X$ is a subprobability measure on $X$. Panangaden's monad is a composite of Giry's and $1 + -$.

## History

The [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] underlying the Giry monad was originally developed [by Lawvere in 1962](#Lawvere62), prior to the full recognition of the relationship between [[monads]] and [[adjunctions]]. Although P. Huber had already shown in 1961 that every [[adjoint functor|adjoint pair]] gives rise to a [[monad]], it wasn't until 1965 that the constructions of Eilenberg-Moore, and Kleisli, made the essential equivalence of both concepts manifest.  

Lawvere's construction was written up as an [appendix to a proposal](#Lawvere62) to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,  set up by President Kennedy as part of the State Department to handle planning and execution of certain treaties with the Soviet Union. This appendix was intended to provide a reasonable framework for arms control verification protocols ([Lawvere 20](#Lawvere20)).

At that time, Lawvere was working for a "think tank" in California, and the purpose of the proposal was to provide a means for verifying compliance with limitations on nuclear weapons.   In the 1980's, [[Michèle Giry]] was collaborating with another French mathematician at that time who was also working with the French intelligence agency, and was able to obtain a copy of the appendix. Giry then developed and extended some of the ideas in the appendix ([Giry 80](#Giry80))

[[Gian-Carlo Rota]] had also (somehow) obtained a copy of [the appendix](#Lawvere62), which ended up in the library at The American Institute of Mathematics, and only became publicly available in 2012. 

From [Lawvere 20](#Lawvere20):

> I'd like to say that the idea of the category of probabilistic mappings, the document corresponding to that was not part of a seminar, as some of the circulations say, essentially it was the document submitted to the arms control and disarmament agency after suitable checking that the Pentagon didn't disagree with it. Because of the fact that for arms control agencies as a side responsibility the forming of arms control agreements and part of these agreements must involve agreed upon protocols of verification. So the idea of that paper did not provide such protocols, but it purported to provide reasonable framework within which such protocol can be formulated.

shows, in effect, that the Giry monad restricted to countable measurable spaces (with the discrete $\sigma$-algebra) yields the restricted Giry functor $G|: \mathbf{Meas}_c \rightarrow \mathbf{Meas}$ which has the codensity monad $G$.  This suggest that the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ are ''sufficient'' in some sense. Indeed, the full subcategory of Polish spaces consisting of the single object $N$ of all natural numbers with the powerset $\sigma$-algebra is codense in $Pol$ for the reasons delineated in the proof above - every continuous function $P{X} \rightarrow X$ is completely determined by its values on the countable dense subset of $P{X}$.
