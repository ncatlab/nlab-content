## Idea

The notion of [[weak complicial set]] is a model for (the [[omega-nerve]] of) the notion of [[weak ∞-category]]. The **model structure for weak $\omega$-categories** is a [[model category]] structure on the category of [[stratified simplicial set]]s, such that cofibrant-fibrant objects are precisely the [[weak complicial set]]s. This model structure may therefore be understood as a presentation of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of weak $\omega$-categories.
