A stub for now.

A quasitopological groupoid is a generalisation of a [[internal category|topological groupoid]] in that composition is not necessarily continuous, but only left and right composition by each arrow (when this is defined). It is the [[horizontal categorification]] of a quasitopological group.


More generally, one can talk about a [[quasi-C groupoid]], where $C$ is a (topological?) concrete category or a site (Warning: the last object is current research by [[David Roberts|me]], and may only be a curiosity).
