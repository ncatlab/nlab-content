##Â Definition

An **irreflexive symmetric relation** is a [[binary relation]] that is [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]] and [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]. 

## Examples

* Every [[apartness relation]] is an irreflexive symmetric relation which is also a [[comparison]]. 

* Every [[tight relation|tight]] irreflexive symmetric relation is [[denial inequality]]. 

## In constructive mathematics

In constructive mathematics, not ever tight irreflexive symmetric relation is a denial inequality. Instead, the [[denial inequality]] is an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ in which $\neg(a = b)$ if and only if $a \neq b$, and a tight irreflexive symmetric relation is called a [[tight inequality]]. 

Some constructive mathematicians use the term "[[inequality relation]]" for an irreflexive symmetric relation, but that term has other definitions in the literature, see [[inequality#InequalityRelation|this section]] for more information.
