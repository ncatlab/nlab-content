##Â Definition

An **irreflexive symmetric relation** is a [[binary relation]] that is [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]] and [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]. A set equipped with an irreflexive symmetric relation is called an **inequality space**

## Examples

* Every [[apartness relation]] is an irreflexive symmetric relation which is also a [[comparison]]. 

* The negation of a [[reflexive symmetric relation]] is an irreflexive symmetric relation. 

* Every [[denial inequality]] is a [[weakly tight relation|weakly tight]] irreflexive symmetric relation. 

## In constructive mathematics
 {#ConstructiveMathematics}

In constructive mathematics, not ever tight irreflexive symmetric relation is a denial inequality, and not every denial inequality is tight. Instead, every [[denial inequality]] is only [[weakly tight]]. Indeed, since excluded middle cannot be proven, we could distinguish between the following irreflexive symmetric relations in constructive mathematics:

* [[denial inequality]], an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ which additionally satisfies $\neg(a = b)$ implies $(a \neq b)$

* [[tight]] irreflexive symmetric relation, an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ which additionally satisfies $\neg(a \neq b)$ implies $(a = b)$

* [[weakly tight relation|weakly tight]] irreflexive symmetric relation, an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ which additionally satisfies $\neg(a \neq b)$ implies $\neg \neg (a = b)$

* [[stable relation|stable]] irreflexive symmetric relation, an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ which additionally satisfies $\neg \neg (a \neq b)$ implies $(a \neq b)$

* [[decidable relation|decidable]] irreflexive symmetric relation, an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ which additionally satisfies $(a \neq b)$ or $\neg (a \neq b)$

* [[apartness relation]], an irreflexive symmetric relation $\neq$ which additionally satisfies $a \neq b$ implies that $a \neq c$ or $c \neq b$

or any combination of the above, such as [[tight apartness relation]]. 

The notion of "[[inequality relation]]" in constructive mathematics usually refers to either the [[denial inequality]] or a [[tight apartness relation]]. On the other hand, some authors have used "inequality relation" to refere to general irreflexive symmetric relations. 

## Antithesis interpretation

Sets equipped with an irreflexive symmetric relation $\nsim$ are known as **antithesis sets** in the [[antithesis interpretation]] of [[constructive mathematics]] in [[intuitionistic logic]]. Then we have the following:

* An antithesis set is **strong** if $\nsim$ is an [[apartness relation]]. 

* An antithesis set is **affirmative** if $\nsim$ is [[denial inequality]]. 

* An antithesis set is **refutative** if $\nsim$ is a [[tight relation]]. 

Thus, every set is an affirmative antithesis set. The [[inequality spaces]] talked about elsewhere in the nLab are strong refutative antithesis sets.
