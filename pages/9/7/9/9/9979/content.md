##Â Definition

An __inequality relation__ is a [[binary relation]] that is [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]] and [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].  An inequality relation is often denoted '$\neq$' (infix) or a variation like $\#$.

## Examples

* Every [[apartness relation]] is an inequality relation which is also a [[comparison]]. 

* Every [[local ring]] has an inequality relation given by $a \# b$ if and only if $b - a$ is invertible. This happens to be an apartness relation. 

## Warning on terminology

The term 'inequality relation' is often shortened to 'inequality', but it should not be confused with [[order]] relations (the sort typically denoted '$\le$' or a variation).  Sometimes 'inequation' is used for a statement containing an inequality relation (much as 'equation' is used for a statement containing an equality relation), leaving 'inequality' to mean a statement containing an order relation).

## Tight inequality relations

A tight inequality relation is an inequality relation such that if $\neg(a \neq b)$ then $a = b$. This concept is trivial in [[classical mathematics]], since every tight inequality on a set is the [[denial inequality]] (the [[negation]] of [[equality relation|equality]]).
