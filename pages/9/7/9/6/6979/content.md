## Idea

_Dependent type theory_ is the flavor of [[type theory]] that admits _[[dependent types]]_.

Its [[categorical semantics]] is in [[locally cartesian closed categories]] $C$, where a [[dependent type]]

$$
  x : X \vdash E(x) \; \mathrm{type}
$$

is interpreted as a [[morphism]]  $E \to X$, hence an [[object]] in the [[slice category]] $C_{/X}$.

Then change of [[context]] corresponds to [[base change]] in $C$. See also _[[dependent sum]]_ and _[[dependent product]]_.

Dependent type systems are heavily used for _[[certified programming|software certification]]_. 

## In the foundations of mathematics

Dependent type theory itself support various [[foundations of mathematics]] via the [[propositions as some types]] interpretation of [[dependent type theory]], where propositions are the types where every two elements are equal 

$$\mathrm{isProp}(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} x =_A y$$

Suppose that a dependent type theory has a separate [[type]] [[judgment]] as well as [[dependent product types]], [[dependent sum types]], [[identity types]], [[weak function extensionality]], [[propositional truncations]], [[empty type]], [[unit type]], [[sum types]]. All the operations in [[predicate logic]] are derivable from said type formers: 

* [[universal quantification]] is the dependent product type of families of propositions due to weak function extensionality

* similarly, [[implication]] is the function type of two propositions due to weak function extensionality, and function types are just dependent product types of a constant family of types

* [[logical conjunction]] is the product type of two propositions, and product types are just dependent sum types of a constant family of types

* [[existential quantification]] is the propositional truncation of dependent sum types

* [[logical disjunction]] is the propositional truncation of sum types

* [[falsehood]] is the empty type

* [[truth]] is the unit type

* [[excluded middle]] and the [[law of double negation]] is stated as an [[inference rule]] about propositions

Then 

* One can add a [[cumulative hierarchy]] to the dependent type theory and work entirely in the cumulative hierarchy for [[material set theory]]

* One can add a [[category of sets]] to the dependent type theory and work entirely in the category of sets for [[structural set theory]]

* One can add a [[type universe]] satisfying certain [[axioms]] and [[axiom schemata]], such as [[universe extensionality]], closure under identity types, closure under dependent sum types, closure under dependent product types, [[propositional resizing]], [[axiom of replacement|replacement]], [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], and [[axiom of choice|choice]], to the dependent type theory and work entirely in the universe for [[univalent type theory]] or [[univalent foundations]]. Adding internal universe types as [[small]] [[object classifiers]] as well as all [[higher inductive types|higher inductive]] and [[coinductive types]] to the universe results in [[homotopy type theory]]. 

* One can add a [[Russell type of all propositions]] and a [[natural numbers type]] and work in the dependent type theory itself for [[higher-order logic]].

###### Theorem

The [[functors]] 

* $Cont$, that form a [[category of contexts]] of a [[dependent type theory]];

* $Lang$ that forms the [[internal language]] of a [[locally cartesian closed category]]

constitute an [[equivalence of categories]]

  LocallyCartesianClosedCategories

This ([Seely, theorem 6.3](#Seely)).  It is somewhat more complicated than this, because we need to strictify the category theory to match the category theory; see [[categorical model of dependent types]].  For a more detailed discussion see at
