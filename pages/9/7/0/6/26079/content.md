> Distinguish from the notion of a group of affine transformations (of an affine space) or the (general) affine group.

## Definition

An __affine group scheme__ is a [[group object]] (hence a [[group scheme]]) [[internalization|internal]] to the [[category]] of [[affine schemes]]. 

## Related notions

If $k$ is a [[commutative ring]], the category of affine group $k$-schemes is [[opposite category|opposite]] to the category of commutative [[Hopf algebra|Hopf $k$-algebras]]. 

By an __affine algebraic group__, one additionally assumes that the underlying scheme is over an [[algebraic variety]] (in particular reduced) and over a field. The narrower notion then agrees with the notion of a [[linear algebraic group]].

[Waterhouse](#Waterhouse)12.1 The Lie algebra of the affine group $k$-scheme $X$ is the Lie algebra of left-invariant $k$-linear derivations $T:\mathcal{O}(X)\to\mathcal{O}(X)$ of the Hopf algebra of regular functions of $X$, which are also morphisms of right comodules: $\Delta\circ T = (id\otimes T)\circ\Delta:\mathcal{O}(X)\to\mathcal{O}(X)\otimes\mathcal{O}(X)$ 
(one says also that $T$ is left-invariant).

This Lie algebra is also isomorphic to the Lie algebra of $k$-linear $k$-valued derivations of $\mathcal{O}(X)$.

## Examples

* The *[[additive group]] scheme* (viewed as a group valued functor on the opposite of the category of affine schemes) assigns to a commutative ring its additive group.
