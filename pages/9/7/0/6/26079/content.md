> Distinguish from the notion of a group of affine transformations (of an affine space) or the (general) affine group.

## Definition

An __affine group scheme__ is a group object in the category of [[affine scheme]]s. 

## Related notions

If $k$ is a commutative ring, the category of affine group $k$-schemes is opposite to the category of commutative [[Hopf algebra|Hopf]] $k$-algebras. 

By an __affine algebraic group__, one additionally assumes that the underlying scheme is over an [[algebraic variety]] (in particular reducible) and over a field. The narrower notion then agrees with the notion of a [[linear algebraic group]].
