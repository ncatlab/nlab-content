__Mathematics__ is the part of [[science]] that constructs and studies [[mathematical objects]] used to implement mathematical models.  The results of study are organized into [[definitions]], [[theorems]], and [[proofs]].

Subfields of mathematics include the following:

* [[philosophy of mathematics]]

* [[foundations of mathematics]]

  * [[set theory]], [[type theory]], [[(infinity,1)-category theory]]

  * [[mathematical logic]]

* mathematical tools
  
  * [[proof assistants]]

* [[topology and geometry|Topology and Geometry]]

  * [[geometry]] (general list), [[topology]] (general list)

  * [[general topology]]
  
  * [[algebraic topology]]

  * [[homotopy theory]]

  * [[rational homotopy theory]]

  * [[differential geometry]]

  * [[differential topology]]

  * [[algebraic geometry]]
  
  * [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]

  * [[noncommutative geometry]] (general flavour)

  * [[higher geometry]]

  * [[Lie theory]]

* [[algebra|Algebra]]:

  * [[universal algebra]]
  
  * [[higher algebra]]

  * [[group theory]] (including generalizations)

  * [[representation theory]]

  * [[algebraic approaches to differential calculus]]

  * [[homological algebra]] 

  * [[gebras]] (co(al)gebras, bi/Hopf-algebr-as/oids...)
