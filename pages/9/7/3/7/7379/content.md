# Quasi-topological spaces

## Idea 

The [[category]] of *quasi-topological spaces* was proposed in [Spanier 1963](#Spanier63) as a substitute for the category [[Top]] of ordinary [[topological spaces]], in order to serve as a [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient category]] for the purposes of [[algebraic topology]]. In particular, quasi-topological spaces form a [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] [[cartesian closed category]]. 

Today, quasi-topological spaces seem to be regarded mostly as a historical curiosity, perhaps because working topologists were never comfortable with the [[set theory|set-theoretic]] issues that accompany them. In retrospect, however, they are an impressive testament to the conceptual insight of [[Edwin Spanier|Spanier]] into ideas of [[topos theory]] which were at the time (early 1960's) barely in the air, and even not quite born yet (being an early example of [[quasitopos]], whose name perhaps derives from Spanier's notion, compare [Dubuc & Español 2006, p. 12](#DubucEspanol06)). 


## Definition 

Let $\mathcal{C H}$ be the [[category]] of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]. This may be regarded as a (large) [[site]] (in fact a [[concrete site]]) when equipped with the [[Grothendieck pretopology]] of finite families $\{ C_\alpha \to X \}_{
\alpha \in I}$ for which the induced map $ \coprod_{\alpha\in I} C_\alpha \to X $ is surjective.

###### Definition 
A **quasi-topological space** is a (small-set valued) [[concrete sheaf]] on $\mathcal{C H}$. 
=-- 

The (super-large) category of quasi-topological spaces is a [[quasitopos]] (although this is not immediately obvious for [[size issues|size reasons]] --- in particular, it is probably not a [[Grothendieck quasitopos]]).  In particular, it is a [[locally cartesian closed category]].
