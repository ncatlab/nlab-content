**Mathematical physics** is a discipline at the interface of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], concerned with developing mathematical models of physical phenomena and mathematical apparatus arising or needed in such models. It intersects with the **theoretical physics** which deals with theoretical arguments in consideration of physical phenomena and the development of models of known and of conjectured physics; theoretical physics is in a sense wider as it deals also with interpretations, non-rigorous and sometimes speculative argument from experiment or from rough comparison of different models and various experimental data, not entering or forming together necessary a compatible mathematical entity. For example, the calculations of fitting parameters and adjusting models to complicated experimental data, called the phenomenology is a part of job of a theoretical physicist, but most of such work is not considered nowdays to  belong to mathematical physics, unless one is developing a really new mathematical model or tool for such work. 

Most recently one also sometimes uses a less familiar term **physical mathematics** for the study of mathematical constructions inspired by models of theoretical physics; thus the final aim may be more mathematical (say finding a new topological invariant using physical intuition) then in the mathematical physics. However there is no clean boundary and to some extent the two notions are interchangeable.

A historically inclined article on mathematical physics is featured on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics).
