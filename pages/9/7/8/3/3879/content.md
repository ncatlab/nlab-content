## Idea

**Mathematical physics** is a discipline at the interface of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], concerned with developing mathematical models of physical phenomena and mathematical apparatus arising or needed in such models. It intersects with **theoretical physics** which deals with theoretical arguments in consideration of physical phenomena and the development of models of known and of conjectured physics; theoretical physics is in a sense wider as it deals also with interpretations, non-rigorous and sometimes speculative argument from experiments or from rough comparisons of different models and various experimental data, not entering or forming together a necessarily compatible mathematical entity. For example, the calculations of fitting parameters and adjusting models to complicated experimental data, called the [[phenomenology]] is part of the work of a theoretical physicist, but most such work is not nowadays considered to belong to mathematical physics, unless one is developing a really new mathematical model or tool for such work. 

More recently, one also sometimes uses a less familiar term **physical mathematics** for the study of mathematical constructions inspired by models of theoretical physics; thus the final aim may be more mathematical (say finding a new topological invariant using physical intuition) than in the mathematical physics. However there is no clean boundary and to some extent the two notions are interchangeable.
