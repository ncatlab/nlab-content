## Idea

Given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite products]] and a suitable set of [[subterminal objects]] $\Phi$, one may construct a new category $\mathcal{C}_{\Phi}$, known as the **filter quotient category**, which has the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$, and where morphisms are given by [[equivalence classes]] of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$, via an equivalence relation generated by $\Phi$.
