## Idea

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite products]] and a suitable set of [[subterminal objects]] $\Phi$, one may construct a new category $\mathcal{C}_{\Phi}$, known as the **filter quotient category**, which has the same [[objects]] as $\mathcal{C}$, but where [[morphisms]] are given by [[equivalence classes]] of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$, via an [[equivalence relation]] generated by $\Phi$.
