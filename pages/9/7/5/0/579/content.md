# Definition #

A **strong epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[epimorphism]] which is left [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to any [[monomorphism]] in $C$.

# Remarks #

* If $C$ has equalizers, then any morphism which is left orthogonal to all monomorphisms must automatically be an epimorphism.

* Every [[regular epimorphism]] is strong.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[regular category|regular]].

* Every strong epimorphism is [[extremal epimorphism|extremal]].  The converse is true if $C$ has [[pullback]]s.
