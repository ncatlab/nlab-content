## Definition 

A **strong epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[epimorphism]] which is left [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to any [[monomorphism]] in $C$.

## Properties

* The composition of  strong epimorphisms is a strong epimorphism. If $f\circ g$ is a strong epimorphism, then $f$ is a strong epimorphism.

* If $C$ has [[equalizers]], then any morphism which is left orthogonal to all monomorphisms must automatically be an epimorphism.

* Every [[regular epimorphism]] is strong.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[regular category|regular]].

* Every strong epimorphism is [[extremal epimorphism|extremal]].  The converse is true if $C$ has [[pullback]]s.

## In higher category theory

A [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] is a [[n-truncated|(-1)-truncated]] morphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$. 

Therefore it makes sense to define an **strong epimorphism in an $(\infty,1)$-category** to be a morphism that is part of the left half of an [[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category]] whose right half is that of $(-1)$-[[truncated]] morphisms.

If $C$ is an [[(∞,1)-topos]] then it has an [[n-connected/n-truncated factorization system]] for all $n$. The $(-1)$-[[connected]] morphisms are also called [[effective epimorphism]]s. Therefore in an $(\infty,1)$-topos strong epimorphisms again coincide with effective epimorphisms.
