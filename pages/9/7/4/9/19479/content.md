Sanjeevi Krishnan is an assistant prof at Ohio State. Previously, he 'postdocked' at the University of Pennsylvania, the Naval Research Lab, and jointly, the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA Saclay) and École Polytechnique. He studied for his Ph.D. in algebraic topology under the supervision of Peter May at the University of Chicago. 

His current research interests are in [[directed homotopy theory]] and other aspects of applied algebraic topology.  He has proved results on [[Poincaré duality]] on directed graphs, linking this to the classical Max Flow Min Cut theorem.
