#Definition#

Let $k$ be a commutative [[ring]].

A **derived Deligne-Mumford stack** (over $k$) is a [[generalized scheme]] in the sense of locally affine $\mathcal{G}$-[[structured (infinity,1)-topos]] for $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}_{et}(k)$ the &#233;tale [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)]].

#Special cases #

A [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|1-localic]] derived Deligne-Mumford stack is an ordinary [[Deligne-Mumford stack]]. See there for more details.

# related concepts #

Notice that for [[generalized scheme]]s the &#233;tale [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)]] $\mathcal{G}_{et}(k)$ is not interchangeable with the Zariski geometry $\mathcal{G}_{et}(k)$. Instead $\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k)$-[[generalized scheme]]s are [[derived scheme]]s.
