
__Ethereum__ is a public [[blockchain]] which is established as a sequel to [[bitcoin]] with intention to include [[smart contract]]s and distributed applications as envisioned by [[Vitalik Buterin]] in 2013. This platform is considered as the main platform of blockchain 2.0 stage in blockchain technology development; as of 2019 it still uses proof of work. 
As of 2019, Ethereum mainnet, which supports the Ether cryptocurrency is still officially beta and many improvements in 2019 and 2020 are planned, called Ethereum 1.x, including replacing the present Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) with ewasm virtual machine for [[WebAssembly]] bytecode. Somewhere in 2020 or 2021, a new release of Ethereum based on proof of stake with sharding and many other improvements (including a rent for smart contracts) is planned to be created; the new platform is called Ethereum 2.0 and will qualify for 3rd generation blockchain platform in terms of scalability and speed, and possibly some level of interoperability. Migration of users from the Ethereum 1.x beta chain will be performed via smart contracting, without hard forks. The old net is likely to stay as a read only record of old history and be attached to the new net as a shardchain. The implementations of Ethereum 2.0 are being coded simultaneously by 9 different teams in several different programming languages. 

Ethereum 1.0 platform has largely influenced development of many subsequent platforms; in particular, [[zoranskoda:Hyperledger]] Fabric is a permissioned blockchain  developed by IBM and Linux Foundation on the basis of Ethereum.
