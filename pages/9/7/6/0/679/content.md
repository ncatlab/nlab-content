$SSet$ is the category of [[simplicial set]]s.

This is the [[functor category]] from the [[opposite category]] $\Delta^{op}$ of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ to the category [[Set]] of sets:

$$
  SSet := [\Delta^{op}, Set]
  \,.
$$

$SSet$ is naturally a [[model category]] using the [[model structure on simplicial sets]].
