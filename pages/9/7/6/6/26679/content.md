## Idea

A _rational homotopy sphere_ is a [[topological space]] which need not be [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]], but which has the same [[rational homotopy type]] as an $n$-sphere, hence whose [[rationalization]] is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to a [[rational n-sphere]].
