## Idea

Multisimplicial sets are the analogs of [[simplicial sets]] with [[simplices]] replaced by [[multisimplices]] (perhaps more appropriately called multiplexes).

###### Definition

An **$n$-fold multisimplicial set**  is a [[presheaf]] on the $n$-fold [[multisimplex category]] $\Delta^n$, that is, a [[functor]] $X\colon(\Delta^n)^{op}\to Sets$, equivalently a [[multisimplicial object]] in the category [[Set]] of sets.

=--

The category of $n$-fold multisimplicial sets can be
equipped with a [[model structure]] that turns
it into a [[model category]] that is Quillen equivalent
to the standard [[Kan?Quillen model structure]] on [[simplicial sets]].

An important operation on multisimplicial sets is the _exterior product_
$$Fun((\Delta^m)^{op},Set)\times Fun((\Delta^n)^{op},Set)\to Fun((\Delta^{m+n})^{op},Set)$$
defined as the [[left Kan extension]] of the tautological functor
$$\Delta^m\times\Delta^n\to\Delta^{m+n}.$$

The exterior product is a [[left Quillen bifunctor]]
whose [[left derived bifunctor]] model the cartesian
product in the [[âˆž-category]] of spaces.

The exterior product is useful when it is desirable
to have a product operation that does not require subdivision.
