#Idea#

**$L_\infty$-algebroids** or **Lie $\infty$-algebroids** are to [[Lie ∞-groupoids]] as [[Lie algebras]] are to [[Lie groups]]. Hence $L_\infty$-algebroids are a [[horizontal categorification]] and [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras: they encompass $L_\infty$-[[L-∞-algebras|algebras]] as well as [[Lie algebroids]].

A Lie $\infty$-algebroid is a [[complex]] $g$ of [[modules]] over a [[ring]] $A_0$, satisfying some (complicated) conditions. It turns out that it is easier to formulate these conditions in terms of the [[Chevalley?Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(g)$ of $g$. This is a certain type of graded super commutative algebra constructed from $g$.


#Definition in terms of differential algebra#


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (Lie $\infty$ Algebroid)

A Lie $\infty$-algebroid $g$ over a manifold $X_0$ is the following data:

* A commutative algebra $A_0$, thought of as the ring of functions on a manifold $X_0$.

* a non-positively graded complex $g$ of (finitely generated projective) $A_0$-modules
$$
\dots \to g_{-n}\to g_{-n+1} \to \dots \to g_0.
$$

* A degree 1 derivation Q on the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra $CE(g)=\wedge^\bullet_{A} g^* = S^\bullet g^*[1]$ of $g$, such that $Q^2=0$.
=--

The Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra $CE(g)$ of a Lie $\infty$-algebroid is a commutative [[semifree dga]], and any such (of non negative degree) is of the form $CE(g)$ for some Lie $\infty$ algebroid.

A morphism of Lie $\infty$ algebroids $g\to h$ is a linear map $\phi\colon CE(h)\to CE(g)$ of the  Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras in the opposite direction, respecting the grading and the differentials. 

Notice that the first few terms of $\wedge^\bullet g^*$ in degree 0, 1 and 2, respectively, are
$$
  \wedge^\bullet g^*
  =
  A_0 \oplus g_0^*[1] \oplus  (g_0^*[1]\wedge g_0^*[1])
  \oplus g_{-1}^*[1] \oplus \cdots
  \,.
$$

###### Example
Take $g = \Gamma(T X)$ to be the $C^\infty(X)$-module of [[tangent vector fields]] on $X$, then $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)} g^* = \wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)} \Omega^1(X) = \Omega^\bullet(X)$.

There is plenty of room to fuss about the grading conventions.

#The Chevalley--Ehresmann functor on Lie $\infty$-algebroids#

A Lie $\infty$-algebroid $g$ is a complex of $A_0$-modules, so corresponds to a bunch of [[vector bundles]] $E_i\to X_0$ over the underlying manifold $X_0$, where $g_i=\Gamma(E_i)$, and the differential of the complex gives fibrations 

$$
\dots \to E_{-n}\to E_{-n+1}\to \dots \to E_0\to X_0
$$

So one can think of a Lie $\infty$-algebroid as a rather intricate classical geometric structure: vector bundles with [[extra stuff]]. These form a category. But taking the Chevalley--Ehresmann algebra gives a functor

$$
  Lie \infty Algebroids \stackrel{CE(-)}{\to} sDGCAs
$$

from the category of Lie $\infty$-algebroids to the category of semi free Differential Graded Commutative algebras (sDGCAs).

Each SDGCA is the algebras of functions on a supermanifold, more precisely an [[NQ-supermanifold]]. So the CE functor gives a remarkable connection between classical geometry and super geometry.


#Remarks#

* The definition of a Lie $\infty$-structure in terms of a dual differential graded-commutative algebra is the higher graded version of the definition of Lie algebras in terms of [Lie coalgebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_coalgebra).

* In the physics literature $CE(g)$ is called a [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra|BRST complex]].


#Special Cases#

* a Lie $\infty$-algebroid over a point, $X = pt$ is an **$L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebra]]**;

* an Lie $\infty$-algebroid $g$ with generators for $CE(g)$ concentrated in the first $n$ degrees is a **Lie $n$-algebroid**;

* an Lie $\infty$-algebroid the differential of whose CE algebra is "co-binary", i.e. $d : \mathfrak{g}^* \to g^* \oplus g^* \wedge g^*$, is **strict**.

So in particular

* a Lie 1-algebroid is a **[[Lie algebroid]]**;

* a Lie 1-algebroid over the point is a **Lie algebra**;

* a Lie $n$-algebroid over a point is a **[[Lie n-algebra]]**.

##Further examples##


* A [[Courant algebroid]] is not exactly an $L_\infty$-algebroid, but it is encoded by a Lie $3$-algebra.

+-- {: .query}
When I read the literature a Courant algebraoid seems to be a Lie 2-algebroid with as extra structure a symplectic form of ghostnumber 2. So it is just a special case of a Lie $\infty$-algebroid, no?

* Standard examples of [[exterior differential system]]s are [[Chevalley?Eilenberg algebras]] of $L_\infty$-algebroids.

#Further resources#

There should be an [[internalization]] of this into the context of [[generalized smooth spaces]] and [[generalized smooth algebras]]. This is discussed at [[schreiber:generalized smooth L-infinity algebroid]].

#References#

The term "Lie $\infty$-algebroid" or "$L_\infty$-algebroid" as such is not as yet established in the literature, as most authors working with these objects think of them entirely in terms of [[NQ-supermanifolds]] and either ignore the relation to [[Lie theory]] or take it more or less for granted. 

Possibly the first explicit appearance of the idea of $\infty$-Lie algebroids recognized in their full [[Lie theory|Lie theoretic]] meaning is

* Pavol &Scaron;evera, _Some title containing the words "homotopy" and "symplectic", e.g. this one_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.SG/0105080))

which uses "[[NQ-supermanifolds]]". Of course, as this article also points out, in hindsight one finds that much of this is already implicit in the much older theory of [[Sullivan model|Sullivan models]] in [[rational homotopy theory]], which is concerned with modelling _spaces_ by qDGCAs. That these spaces can be regarded as [[∞-groupoids]] and as [[Lie ∞-groupoids]] in particular is clear in hindsight, but was possibly first explicitly realized in the above reference. See also [[Lie integration]].
