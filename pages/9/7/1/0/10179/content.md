## Idea
 {#Idea}

Every [[topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is canonically a [[cartesian closed monoidal category]] $(\mathbf{H}, \times)$, with the [[tensor product]] being the [[cartesian product]] "$\times$". But if, in addition to this canonical product, $\mathbf{H}$ is equipped with _another_ (hence necessarily non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]]) [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[tensor product]] [[structure]] "$\otimes$", then $(\mathbf{H}, \otimes)$ might be called a _monoidal topos_. 

If the extra monoidal structure is also [[closed monoidal category|closed]], one also speaks, generally, of a *[[doubly closed monoidal category]]*-[[structure]] (with [[internal logic]] a *[[bunched logic]]*). Hence instead of "monoidal topos" it might make sense to speak of "doubly monoidal topos".

Of course, a topos may carry more than one non-cartesian monoidal category structure, and in some of the interesting examples, the various monoidal structures will be interlinked in some way. A typical example is the phenomenon of [[plethysm]]. 

## Examples

\begin{example}
\label{ViaDayConvolution}
For $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ a small [[monoidal category]], the [[presheaf topos]] $[\mathcal{C}, Set]$ is naturally a [[doubly closed monoidal category|doubly closed monoidal]] topos with respect to the [[Day convolution]] tensor product.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{SliceToposOverAMonoidObject}
**(slice topos over a monoid object)**
\linebreak
For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[topos]] and $\mathbb{G} \in \mathbf{H}$ a [[monoid object]], the [[slice topos]]  $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbb{G}}$ inherits a non-cartesian monoidal structure $\otimes_G$ induced from the product structure on $\mathbb{G}$:

$$
  \left[
    \array{
      X_1
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\chi_1}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G}
   }
   \;\;
  \right]
  \otimes_{\mathbb{G}}
  \left[
    \array{
      X_2
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\chi_2}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G}
   }
   \;\;
  \right]
  \;\;
  \coloneqq
  \;\;
  \left[
    \array{
      X_1 \times X_2
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\chi_1, \chi_2)}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{G}
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\cdot}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G}
    }
    \;\;\;\;\;
  \right]
  \,.
$$

Such monoidal toposes are always biclosed and appear as categories of [[local action functionals]] in the context of _[[motivic quantization]]_.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
This Ex. \ref{SliceToposOverAMonoidObject} overlaps with the previous Ex. \ref{ViaDayConvolution} in the case where the given topos is [[Set|$Set$]] and the small category $\mathcal{C}$ is the [[discrete category]] on a [[small set]] $X$. In that case, the monoidal category structure is just a [[monoid]] [[structure]] on $X$ and the two definitions of a monoidal structure agree up to [[isomorphism]].
\end{remark}

###### Example

The [[classifying topos for the theory of objects]] -- namely the [[presheaf topos]] $[FinSet, Set]$ on the [[opposite category]] of [[FinSet]], or equivalently the category of [[finitary monad|finitary]] [[endofunctors]] $End_f(Set)$ -- is naturally a monoidal topos under [[composition]] of endofunctors. A standard textbook reference is ([Johnstone D3.2](#Johnstone)). The [[enriched category theory]] over this monoidal category is discussed in ([Garner 13](#Garner13)).

+-- {: .num_example} 
###### Example 

There are several variations on the theme of the previous example \ref{ClassifyingToposForTheoryOfObjects}, where one considers [[presheaves]] on the "$\underline{\;\;\;\;\;}$" monoidal category $M$ generated by a single object, where the "blank" may be filled in with some structure-connoting adjective. In the previous example, we had that $FinSet^{op}$ is the [[free construction|free]] [[cartesian monoidal category]] generated by a single object, but the blank might be filled in with "symmetric" ($M$ is the [[permutation category]] $\mathbb{P} = Core(FinSet)$), or "braided" (the [[braid category]] $\mathbb{B}$), or "semicartesian symmetric monoidal" ([[FinInj|$Fin_{inj}$]]: finite sets and [[injections]] between them), or "strict" (the discrete category $\mathbb{N}$), and so on. In each of these cases, the [[presheaf topos]] $E = [M^{op}, Set]$ acquires a [[Day convolution]] structure, but more interestingly, we have an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] 

$$E \simeq \{E, E\}$$ 

where the right side is the category of cocontinuous $\underline{\;\;\;\;\;}$ monoidal endofunctors. By transferring the endofunctor composition across the equivalence, $E$ acquires another monoidal product structure. In the classical symmetric case, this goes under names like [[plethysm|plethystic monoidal product]], and in each such case the notion of monoid therein gives a notion of [[operad]]. See also [[generalized multicategory]]. For more on this see at _[operad -- A detailed conceptual treatment](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/operad#Conceptual)_.

###### Example

The category of [[dendroidal sets]] is a topos (the [[presheaf topos]] on the [[tree category]]) and naturally carries the non-cartesian [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]].

###### Example

In &lbrack;[Dolan 2011](#Dolan11)&rbrack; is indicated a category of "toric [[quasicoherent sheaves]]" which is a topos and hence under tensor product of quansicoherent sheaves a (semi?)-monoidal topos.

=--

\begin{example}\label{TangentInfinityTopos}
  Given an [[(\infinity,1)-topos|$\infty$-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, its [[tangent (infinity,1)-topos|tangent $\infty$-topos]] $T \mathbf{H}$ carries the [[external tensor product|external]] [[smash product of spectra]].

Similarly, given a [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable $\infty$-category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (or more generally a [[Joyal locus]], see there for more), the [[(infinity,1)-category]] $\int_{\mathcal{X} \in Grpd_\infty} Func(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{A})$ of [[infinity-Grpd|$Grpd_\infty$]]-[[parameterized stable homotopy theory|parameterized]] $\mathcal{A}$-objects (is an [[(infinity,1)-topos|$\infty$-topos]] and) should carry the corresponding [[external tensor product]].
\end{example}
