In a typed language, a _coherent formula_ is a [[logic]]al sentence obtained from atomic ones by using the logical connectives $\vee$, $\bottom$, $\wedge$, $\top$ and the [[quantifier]] $\exists x$, where $x$ is of finitely presented type. 

So this excludes existential quantification over function types
