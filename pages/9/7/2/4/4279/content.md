## Idea
 {#Idea}

The concept of _state on a star-algebra_ is the formalization of the general idea of [[states]] from the point of view of  [[quantum probability theory]] and [[AQFT|algebraic quantum theory]].

In order to motivate the definition from more traditional formulations in  [[physics]], recall that there a _[[state]]_ $\langle - \rangle$ is the information that allows to  assign to each [[observable]] $A$ the [[expectation value]] $\langle A\rangle$ that this observable has when the [[physical system]] is assumed to be in that state.

Often this is formalized in the [[Schrödinger picture]] where a [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] [[space of states]] $\mathcal{H}$ is taken as primary, and the [[observables]] are [[representation|represented]] as suitable [[linear operators]] $A$ on $\mathcal{H}$. Then for $\psi \in \mathcal{H}$ a state ([[pure state]]) the [[expectation value]] of $A$ in this state is the [[inner product]] $\langle \psi \vert A \vert \psi \rangle \coloneqq (\psi, A \psi)$. This defines a [[linear function]]

$$
  \langle \psi \vert (-) \vert \psi \rangle
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{A}
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}
$$

on the [[algebra of observables]] $\mathcal{A}$, satisfying some extra properties.

Conversely, in the [[Heisenberg picture]] one may take the "abstract" [[associative algebra|algebra]] [[algebra of quantum observables|of observables]] as primary (i.e. not necessarily manifested as an [[operator algebra]]), and declare that a state is any linear functional

$$
  \langle - \rangle
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{A}
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}
$$

which is _positive_ in that $\langle A^\ast A\rangle \geq 0$ and _normalized_ in that $\langle 1\rangle = 1$.   Under suitable conditions a [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] [[space of states]] may be (re-)constructed from this *a posteriori* via the _[[GNS construction]]_. 

Traditionally this definition is considered for [[algebras of observables]] which are [[C*-algebras]] (as usually required for [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]], see e.g. [Fredenhagen 03, section 2](#Fredenhagen03)), but the definition makes sense generally for plain [[star-algebras]], such as for instance for the [[formal power series algebras]] that appear in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (e.g. [Bordemann-Waldmann 96, def. 1](#BordemannWaldmann96), [Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, def. 2.4](#FredenhagenRejzner12), [Khavkine-Moretti 15, def. 6](#KhavkineMoretti15), [Dütsch 18, def. 2.11](#Duetsch18)).

The perspective that states are normalized positive linear functionals on the algebra of observables is implicit in traditional [[perturbative quantum field theory]], where it is encoded in the [[2-point function]] corresponding to a [[vacuum state]] or more generally a [[quasi-free quantum state]] (the _[[Hadamard propagator]]_).  The perspective is made explicit in [[algebraic quantum field theory]] (see e.g. [Fredenhagen 03, section 2](#Fredenhagen03)) and for [[star-algebras]] of observables that are not necessarily [[C*-algebras]] in [[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]] (e.g. [Bordemann-Waldmann 96](#BordemannWaldmann96), [Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, def. 2.4](#FredenhagenRejzner12), [Khavkine-Moretti 15, def. 6](#KhavkineMoretti15), [Dütsch 18, def. 2.11](#Duetsch18)).

### For unital star algebras

+-- {: .num_defn #StateOnAStarAlgebra}
###### Definition
**([[state]] on a [[unital algebra|unital]] [[star algebra]])**

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[unital]] [[star-algebra]] over the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$. A _state_ on $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[linear function]]

$$
  \rho \;\colon\; \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

such that

1. (positivity) for all $A \in \mathcal{A}$ the value of $\rho$ on the product $A^\ast A$ is 

   1. [[real part|real]] $\,\rho(A^\ast A) \in \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ 

   1. as such [[non-negative real number|non-negative]]: $\rho(A^\ast A) \geq 0$.

1. (normalization) $\rho(1) = 1$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**([[probability theory|probability theoretic]] interpretation of [[state on a star-algebra]])**

A [[star algebra]] $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with a [[state on a star-algebra|state]] is also called a _[[quantum probability space]]_, at least when $\mathcal{A}$ is in fact a [[von Neumann algebra]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #StatesFormAConvexSet}
###### Remark
**([[state on a star-algebra|states]] form a [[convex set]])**

For $\mathcal{A}$ a unital [[star-algebra]], the [[set]] of states on $\mathcal{A}$ according to def. \ref{StateOnAStarAlgebra} is naturally a [[convex set]]: For $\rho_1, \rho_2 \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{C}$ two states then for every $p \in [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ also the [[linear combination]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{A}
     &\overset{p \rho_1 + (1-p) \rho_2}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbb{C}
    \\
    A &\mapsto& p \rho_1(A) + (1-p) \rho_2(A)
  }
$$
 

is a state.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #PureStateOnAStarAlgebra}
###### Definition
**([[pure state]])**

A state $\rho \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{C}$ on a unital [[star-algebra]] (def. \ref{StateOnAStarAlgebra}) is called a _[[pure state]]_ if it is extremal in the [[convex set]] of all states (remark \ref{StatesFormAConvexSet}) in that an identification

$$
  \rho = p \rho_1 + (1-p) \rho_2
$$

for $p \in (0,1)$ implies that $\rho_1 = \rho_2$ (hence $= \rho$).

### For $C^\ast$-Algebras

The following discusses states specifically on [[C*-algebras]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An element $A$ of an (abstract) $C^*$-algebra is called **[[positive operator|positive]]** if it is [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] and its [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] is contained in $[0, \infinity)$. We write $A \ge 0$ and say that the set of all [[positive operators]] is the positive cone (of a given $C^*$-algebra).
=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This definition is motivated by the [[Hilbert space]] situation, where an operator $A \in \mathcal{B} (\mathcal{H})$ is called [[positive operator|positive]] if for every vector $x \in \mathcal{H}$ the inequality $ \langle x, A x \rangle \ge 0$ holds. If the abstract $C^*$-algebra of the definition above is represented on a Hilbert space, then we see that by [[functional calculus]] we can define a self adjoint operator $B$ by $B \coloneqq f(A)$ with $f(t) := t^{1/2}$ and get  $ \langle x, A x \rangle = \langle B x, B x \rangle \ge 0$. This shows that the positive elements of the abstract algebra, if represented on a Hilbert space, become positive operators as defined here in the Hilbert space setting.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[linear functional]] $\rho$ on an $C^*$-algebra is **positive** if $A \ge 0$ implies that  $\rho(A) \ge 0$.

A **state** of a unital $C^*$-algebra is [[linear functional]] $\rho$ such that $\rho$ is positive and $\rho(1) = 1$.

=--

Though the mathematical notion of state is already close to what physicists have in mind, they usually restrict the set of states further and consider normal states only. We let $\mathcal{R}$ be an $C^*$-algebra and $\pi$ an representation of $\mathcal{R}$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.
 

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Definition/Theorem

A **normal state** $\rho$ is a state that satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

* $\rho$ is weak-operator continuous on the unit ball of $\pi(\mathcal{R})$.

* $\rho$ is strong-operator continuous on the unit ball $\pi(\mathcal{R})$.

* $\rho$ is ultra-weak continuous.

* There is an operator $A$ of [[trace class]] of $\mathcal{H}$ with $tr(A) = 1$ such that $\rho(\pi(R)) = tr(A \pi(R))$ for all $R \in \mathcal{R}$.

=--

This appears as [KadisonRingrose, def. 7.1.11, theorem 7.1.12](#KadisonRingrose)


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This list is not complete, there are more commonly used equivalent characterizations of normal states.

The last one is most frequently used by physicists, in that context the operator $A$ is also called a [[density matrix]] or density operator.

Sometimes the observables of a system are described by an abstract $C^*$-algebra, in this case an important notion is the folium:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
The **folium** of a representation $\pi$ of an $C^*$-algebra  $\mathcal{R}$ on a Hilbert space is the set of normal states of $\pi(\mathcal{R})$.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A state $\rho$ of a representation is called a **vector state** if there is a $x \in \mathcal{H}$ such that $\rho(\pi(R)) = \langle \pi(R)x, x \rangle$ for all $R \in \mathcal{R}$.
=--

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Normal states are vector states if $\mathcal{R}$ is a [[von Neumann algebra]] with a separating vector. More precisely: Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a von Neumman algebra acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, let $\rho$ be a normal state of $\mathcal{R}$ and $x \in \mathcal{H}$ be a separating vector for $\mathcal{R}$, then there is a $y \in \mathcal{H}$ such that $\rho(R) = \langle Ry, y \rangle$ for all $R \in \mathcal{R}$.
=--

This appears as [KadisonRingrose, theorem 7.2.3](#KadisonRingrose).

The set of states of an $C^*$-algebra is sometimes called the **[[space of quantum states|state space]]**.

The state space is non-empty (define a state on the subalgebra $\mathbb{C} 1$ and extend it to the whole $C^*$-algebra via the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]), convex and weak$^*$-compact, so it has extreme points. By the [[Krein-Milman theorem]] (see Wikipedia: [Krein-Milman theorem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krein%E2%80%93Milman_theorem)) it is the weak$^*$-closure of its extreme points.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A **pure state** is a state that is an extreme point of the state space.
=--

The term "pure" originates from the notion of [[entanglement]], a pure state is not a mixture of two distinct other states.


## Examples

+-- {: .num_prop #ClassicalProbabilityMeasureAsStateOnMeasurableFunctions}
###### Proposition
**(classical [[probability measure]] as state on [[measurable functions]])**

For $\Omega$ classical [[probability space]], hence a [[measure space]] which normalized total measure $\int_\Omega d\mu = 1$, let $\mathcal{A} \coloneqq L^1(\Omega)$ be the algebra of Lebesgue [[measurable functions]] with values in the [[complex numbers]], regarded as a [[star algebra]] by pointwise [[complex conjugation]]. Then forming the [[expectation value]] with respect to $\mu$ defines a [[state on a star-algebra|state]] (def. \ref{StateOnAStarAlgebra}):

$$
  \array{
    L^1(\Omega) 
      &\overset{\langle (-)\rangle_\mu}{\longrightarrow}& 
    \mathbb{C}
    \\
    A &\mapsto& \int_\Omega A d\mu
  }
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_example #ElementsOfHilbertSpaceAsPureStates}
###### Example
**(elements of a [[Hilbert space]] as [[pure states]] on [[bounded operators]])**

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a [[complex numbers|complex]] [[separable Hilbert space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] with [[inner product]] $\langle -,-\rangle$ and let $\mathcal{A} \coloneqq \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ be the algebra of [[bounded operators]], regarded as a [[star algebra]] under forming [[adjoint operators]]. Then for every element $\psi \in \mathcal{H}$ of unit [[norm]] $\langle \psi,\psi\rangle = 1$ there is the [[state on a star-algebra|state]] (def. \ref{StateOnAStarAlgebra}) given by

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})
      &\overset{\langle (-)\rangle_\psi}{\longrightarrow}&
     \mathbb{C}
     \\
     A &\mapsto& \langle \psi \vert\, A \, \vert \psi \rangle &\coloneqq& \langle \psi, A \psi \rangle
  }
$$

These are [[pure states]] (def. \ref{PureStateOnAStarAlgebra}).

More general states in this case are given by [[density matrices]].
