Higher topos theory is the generalisation to [[higher category theory]] of [[topos theory]]. It is partly motivated by [[Grothendieck]]'s program in _[[Pursuing Stacks]]_.

More generally, the concept _$(n,r)$-topos_ is to [[topos]] as [[(n,r)-category]] is to [[category]].

Rather little is known about the very general notion of higher topos theory. A rich theory however exists in the context of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].

Just as the archetypical example of an ordinary [[topos]] (i.e. a $(1,1)$-topos) is [[Set]] -- the category of [[0-category|0-categories]] -- so the $\infty$-category of [[n-category|n-categories]] or at least of $n$-[[groupoid]]s should form the archetypical example of an $(n+1,1)$-topos. 


## general higher topos theory ##

[[Mike Shulman]] has some ideas about more general higher topos theory 

* [[michaelshulman:What is a 2-topos|What is a 2-topos]] (part of [[michaelshulman:2-categorical logic|2-categorical logic]])
* [[michaelshulman:n-topos for large n|n-topos for large n]].


## $(\infty,1)$-topos theory ##

Early frameworks for [[Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck]] (as opposed to "elementary") $(\infty,1)$-topoi are due [[Charles Rezk]] and [[Bertrand Toen|Toën]]--Vezzosi in two versions (preprints 2002), via [[simplicially enriched category|simplically enriched categories]] and via [[Segal category|Segal categories]]:

[[Jacob Lurie]] has given the abstract [[models for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes|model]]-independent definition of [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-toposes of (∞,1)-sheaves]] in 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]] 

and shown that Brown-Joyal-Jardine [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] (for ordinary [[∞-stack]]s) and more generally the To&#235;n-Vezzosi [[model structure on simplicially enriched presheaves]] (for [[derived ∞-stack]]s) are indeed models for this theory.

In this context, indeed the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞-Grpd]] or [[Top]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s or equivalently (see [[homotopy hypothesis]]) of (compactly generated weakly Hausdorff) [[topological spaces]] -- is the archetypical example of an $(\infty,1)$-topos.
