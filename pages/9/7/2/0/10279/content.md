## Idea

An *antilinear map* or *conjugate linear map* is much like a [[linear map]], but instead of commuting with "[[scalar]] [[multiplication]]" it "anti-commutes" with it, in that multiplication by a scalar $c$ is mapped to multiplication by the scalar's [[star-conjugation|conjugate]] $\overline{c}$.

In order to make sense of this notion, the [[ground ring]] of the [[modules]] (or [[ground field]] of the [[vector spaces]]) that serve as the map's [[source|domain]] and [[codomain]] must have the additional structure of an [[involution]], to serve as the [[star-conjugation|conjugation]] map $c \mapsto \overline{c}$.

An antilinear map has a central role in the concept of [[star-algebra]]. Conversely, an antilinear map can be seen as built on a star-algebra, in that the [[involution]] makes the [[ground ring]] into a [[star-algebra]] over itself.


## Definition

Given a [[commutative ring]] (often a [[field]], or possibly just a [[rig]]) $K$, equipped with an [[involution]] $x \mapsto \overline{x}$, meaning an [[endomorphism]] with $\overline{\overline{x}} = x$ for all $x \in K$.

Then for $K$-[[modules]] (or $K$-[[linear spaces]]) $V, W$, a __$K$-antilinear map__ is a function $T \colon V \to W$ such that for all $x, y \in V$ and $r \in K$,

$$ 
  T(r \cdot x + y) 
  \;=\; 
  \overline{r} \cdot T(x) + T(y) 
  \,.
$$

This differs from the definition of a [[linear map]] in the appearance of $\overline{(-)}$ on the right-hand side.

## Examples

### Simple general examples

Every $K$-linear map is also a $K$-antilinear map, for $K$ regarded as equipped with the [[identity function|identity]] [[involution]].

Any involution $\overline{(-)} \colon K \to K$ is itself an antilinear map.


### Complex vector spaces

A motivating class of examples is when $K = \mathbb{C}$ is the [[complex numbers]], and $\overline{(-)}$ is [[complex conjugation]].

In particular, the [[Hermitian adjoint]] is an antilinear map from a space of $\mathbb{C}$-linear operators to itself.


### Further examples

A [[star-algebra|$*$-algebra]] requires by definition its [[anti-involution]] to be antilinear.
