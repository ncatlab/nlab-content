I'll try to work out some stuff here. If anything becomes interesting in the slightest, I hope to add a new page to the nLab collection. Any editorial angels who wish to help add, correct, comment, etc, please feel free.

My ultimate goal is to follow what others at the nLab are doing and reformulate it in a way I can understand (which usually means that I need to "discretize" everything).

**Warning: Under Construction**

##Discrete Smooth Spaces

My current motivation is to try to discretize the definition of a Frolicher space (from [Andrew Stacey's paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2225)).

###Definition (Frolicher) 

A Frolicher space is a triple $(X,C,F)$ where $X$ is a set, $C$ is a family of curves in $X$, i.e. a subset of $Map(R,X)$, and $F$ is a
family of functionals on $X$, i.e. a subset of $Map(X,R)$. 


The sets $C$ and $F$ have to satisfy the following compatibility condition: a curve $c: R\to X$ is in $C$ if and only if $fc\in C^\infty(R,R)$ for all functionals $f\in F$, and similarly a functional $f: X\to R$ is in
$F$ if and only if $fc\in C^\infty(R,R)$ for all curves $c: R\to X$.

I guess the first place to start is to define what I mean by a discrete space.

###Definition (Discrete Space)

Given a [[directed graph]] $G = (G_0,G_1,s,t)$, a discrete space is the [graded differential algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_graded_algebra) (DGA) 

$$\Omega(G) = \bigoplus_{r\ge 0} \Omega^r(G)$$

generated by a complete set of orthogonal vertex projections

$$\{\pi_v:G_0\to G_0|v\in G_0\}$$

and the set of edge projections

$$\{\pi_e:G_1\to G_1|e\in G_1\}.$$

The subalgebra $\Omega^0(G)$ of vertex projections is commutative and satisfies the relations

\[\sum_{v\in G_0} \pi_v = 1\]

with product given simply by composition

\[\pi_v \pi_v' = \delta_{v,v'} \pi_v.\]

Right multiplication $\Omega^1(G)\times\Omega^0(G)\to\Omega^1(G)$ is given by

$$\pi_e\pi_v = \delta_{t(e),v} \pi_e$$

and left multiplication $\Omega^0(G)\times\Omega^1(G)\to\Omega^1(G)$ is gievn by

$$\pi_v\pi_e = \delta_{v,s(e)} \pi_e.$$

###Generating a Discrete Space

The derivation

$$d: \Omega^0(G)\to \Omega^1(G)$$

applied to vertex projections results in,

\[\sum_i d\pi_i = 0\]

and

\[d(\pi_i \pi_j) = (d \pi_i) \pi_j + \pi_i (d \pi_j) = \delta_{i,j} d\pi_i,\]

which, in particular, provides the graded commutative relation

\[[\pi_i,d\pi_i] = d\pi_i.\]

The commutative relation helps us to order the 0-projections to the left of the 1-projections. For example, define

$$\pi_{i,j} := \pi_i (d\pi_j) \pi_j.$$

Commuting $\pi_j$ to the left results in

$$\begin{aligned}
\pi_{i,j} 
&= \pi_i (d\pi_j) \pi_j \\
&= \pi_i ([\pi_j,d\pi_j] - \pi_j d\pi_j) \\
&= (1-\delta_{i,j}) \pi_i d\pi_j
\end{aligned}$$

Blah blah...

Multiplying by $\pi_i$ on the left and $\pi_j$ on the right, we have

$$\pi_i (d\pi_j) \pi_j = (\delta_{i,j} - 1) \pi_i (d\pi_i) \pi_j$$

Note: I just found that what I am trying to outline here is very closely related to this paper: [C* Algebras of Infinite Graphs](http://www.ams.org/proc/2000-128-08/S0002-9939-99-05378-2/S0002-9939-99-05378-2.pdf)

Note: The plot thickens. Reference tracking opened a floodgate. I'm trying to track down [Graphs, groupoids and Cuntz-Krieger algebras](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.38.93), but in the meantime came across [Fundamental groupoids of k-graphs](http://www.emis.de/journals/NYJM/j/2004/10-12.pdf). A $k$-graph seems to be a lot like a diamond complex.

Note: This looks like a very interesting and readable thesis: [$C^*$-algebras associated to higher-rank graphs](http://www.newcastle.edu.au/service/library/adt/uploads/approved/adt-NNCU20060327.122628/public/02whole.pdf)

####Doodles

In our paper, we began the discussion in the framework of directed graphs. I wonder if we could present it in the context of the nerve of a category? Before I can do that, I probably need to learn what a nerve of a category is.

What if we begin with a discrete graph $G$ and....
