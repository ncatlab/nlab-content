This is my personal sandbox, where I'll try to work out some stuff. If anything becomes interesting in the slightest, I hope to add a new page. Any editorial angels who wish to help add, correct, etc, please feel free.

##Discrete Smooth Spaces

I hope to adapt the definition of a Frolicher space to discrete/abstract space.

###Definition 2.2 (Frolicher) 

A Frolicher space is a triple $(X,C,F)$ where $X$ is a set, $C$ is a family of curves in $X$, i.e. a subset of $Map(R,X)$, and $F$ is a
family of functionals on $X$, i.e. a subset of $Map(X,R)$. 


The sets $C$ and $F$ have to satisfy the following compatibility condition: a curve $c: R\to X$ is in $C$ if and only if $fc\in C^\infty(R,R)$ for all functionals $f\in F$, and similarly a functional $f: X\to R$ is in
$F$ if and only if $fc\in C^\infty(R,R)$ for all curves $c: R\to X$.

I guess the first place to start is to define what I mean by a discrete space.

###Discrete Space

Given a directed graph $G$ with nodes denoted by

$$e_i\in G_0$$

and directed edges denoted by

$$e_{i,j}: e_i\to e_j\in G_1,$$

a discrete space is the space generated by the differential algebra of projections

$$\pi_i:G_0\to G_0, \pi_i(e_j) = \delta_{i,j} e_j$$

satisfying

$$\pi_i \pi_j = \delta_{i,j} \pi_i$$

and

$$\sum_i \pi_i = 1.$$

Applying the Leibniz rule results in,

$$d(\pi_i \pi_j) = (d \pi_i) \pi_j + \pi_i (d \pi_j) = \delta_{i,j} d\pi_i$$

Multiplying by $\pi_i$ on the left and $\pi_j$ on the right, we have

$$\pi_i (d\pi_j) \pi_j = (\delta_{i,j} - 1) \pi_i (d\pi_i) \pi_j$$


####Doodles

In our paper, we began the discussion in the framework of directed graphs. I wonder if we could present it in the context of the nerve of a category? Before I can do that, I probably need to learn what a nerve of a category is.

What if we begin with a discrete graph $G$ and....
