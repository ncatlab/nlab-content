Is it really a good idea to create pages for new authors that say nothing but 'category\: people'? I think that it might be better to leave the pages unwritten, so that they might notice the question marks by their names and be inspired to tell us about themselves. &#8212;Toby

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: That is a good question! I was going to ask about that. I'll pose the question on the blog and see what others have to say. Personally, when I first edited a page and saw my author name at the bottom with a big greyed out background and a question mark after it, I felt "pressured" to create my own page just to cosmetically get rid of the greyed out background. My thought was that by adding SOMETHING to the author's page, it would take off some of that pressure and they can modify it whenever they want to at their leisure.

The point for adding "category: people" is that they will show up when you click "people", so you can see a list of names of people who have contributed.

I'm happy to do whatever you guys want. I thought I was doing a service to new authors, but I can see various arguments either way.
