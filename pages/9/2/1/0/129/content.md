This is my personal sandbox, where I'll try to work out some stuff. If anything becomes interesting in the slightest, I hope to add a new page. Any editorial angels who wish to help add, correct, etc, please feel free.

##Discrete Smooth Spaces

I hope to adapt the definition of a Frolicher space to discrete/abstract space.

###Definition 2.2 (Frolicher) 

A Frolicher space is a triple $(X,C,F)$ where $X$ is a set, $C$ is a family of curves in $X$, i.e. a subset of $Map(R,X)$, and $F$ is a
family of functionals on $X$, i.e. a subset of $Map(X,R)$. 

The sets $C$ and $F$ have to satisfy the following compatibility condition: a curve $c: R\to X$ is in $C$ if and only if $fc\in C^\infty(R,R)$ for all functionals $f\in F$, and similarly a functional $f: X\to R$ is in
$F$ if and only if $fc\in C^\infty(R,R)$ for all curves $c: R\to X$.

I guess the first place to start is to define what I mean by a discrete space.

###Discrete Space

In our paper, we began the discussion in the framework of directed graphs. I would like to be able to present it in the context of the nerve of a category. Before I can do that, I probably need to learn what a nerve of a category is.
