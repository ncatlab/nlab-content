## Definition

For $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]],
an [[(∞,1)-category]] is called _$\kappa$-compactly generated_ if it is
$\kappa$-[[accessible (infinity,1)-category|accessible]] and [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]].

This is equivalent to it being [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]] to the $\infty$-category $Ind_\kappa(\mathcal{D})$ of [[ind-objects in an (∞,1)-category|ind-objects]] in a [[small (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{D}$ with $\kappa$-small [[(∞,1)-colimits]]. 

([[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 5.5.7.1]])



## Properties

### Recognition for stable $(\infty,1)$-categories

Compact generation for [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] is detected already on their [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] as discussed at _[[compactly generated triangulated category]]_

([[Higher Algebra|HA, remark 1.4.4.3]]))
