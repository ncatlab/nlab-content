An _abelian group_ is a [[group]] where the multiplication satisfies the commutative law:
$$x y = y x.$$

Alternatively, just as a [[group]] is a [[groupoid]] with one object, an abelian group is a [[2-groupoid]] with one object and one morphism.  

The [[category]] with abelian groups as [[object|objects]] and group homomorphisms as [[morphism|morphisms]] is called [[Ab]].
