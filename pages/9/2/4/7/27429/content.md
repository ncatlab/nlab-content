## Definition

Recall that a [[filter]] $F$ on a [[lattice]] $L$ is called __[[prime filter|prime]]__ if $\bot \notin F$ and, whenever $x \vee y \in F$, then $x \in F$ or $y \in F$.  In other words, for every [[finite set|finite index set]] $I$, $x_k \in F$ for some $k$ whenever $\bigvee_{i\colon I} x_i \in F$.

We now generalise from finitary [[joins]] to [[countable set|countable]] joins:  A filter $F$ on a [[sigma-complete lattice|$\sigma$-complete lattice]] $L$ is __countably prime__ if, for any countable index set $I$, $x_k \in F$ for some $k$ whenever $\bigvee_{i\colon I} x_i \in F$. 

If $L$ is a [[sigma-frame|$\sigma$-frame]], then a countably prime filter of $L$ is given by a $\sigma$-frame homomorphism from $L$ to the initial $\sigma$-frame, which is the [[boolean domain]] in [[classical mathematics]] and in [[constructive mathematics]] that assumes the [[limited principle of omniscience]]. Thinking of $L$ as a [[sigma-locale|$\sigma$-locale]], this is the same as a point of $L$.
