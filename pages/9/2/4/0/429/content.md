## Idea

The subject of _universal algebra_ is the study of types of structures in [[algebra]]. For instance instead of studying properties of [[group]]s, in universal algebra one studies properties of the _theory of groups_ . This is an example of an [[algebraic theory]] which is a [[Lawvere theory]], also an [[algebra over a monad]].
