### General
 {#GeneralIdea}

In [[solid state physics]], a [[phase of matter]] (of a [[quantum material]]) is called *topological* (sometimes: a *topological state of matter*), within a given [[energy]] bound $\Delta$ (the "gap") if external deformations of the system that are gentle enough -- namely "[[adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]]" -- not to excite modes ([[quanta]]) $\gt \Delta$ above the [[ground state]] leave the main properties of the system [[invariant]]. This is vaguely reminiscent of how [[topology]] is concerned with properties of [[spaces]] that are invariant under "gentle" -- namely "[[continuous map|continuous]]" -- deformations. Indeed, it turns out or is expected that topological phases of matter may be characterized (classified) by certain [[homeomorphism classes]] or rather by [[homotopy classes]] of the kind studied in [[topology]], or rather in [[homotopy theory]] and [[generalized cohomology theory]] (e.g. the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]).

Such topological phases are fundamentally different from classical [[phases of matter]] in that they are *not* controlled by the [[Landau theory of phase transitions]].


### Topological insulators

For instance, a [[topological insulator]]-phase of a [[crystal|crystalline]] material (a prime example being [[graphene]], see also [below](#ExampleGraphene)) is one where the [[valence band]] of energies occupied by the crystal's [[electrons]] is separated by such an energy gap from the [[conduction band]], and where the [[valence bundle]] of the electron's occupied [[quantum states]], as a [[topological vector bundle]] over the material's [[Brillouin torus]], has (see also [[fiber bundles in physics]]):

1. a non-[[trivial bundle|trivial]] [[equivariant bundle|equivariant]] [[homeomorphism class]], in fact 

1. a non-trivial [[equivariant homotopy class|equivariant]] [[homotopy class]] of its [[classifying map]], in fact

1. a non-vanishing [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology|generalized]] [[cohomology class]] in [[twisted equivariant K-theory|twisted equivariant]] [[topological K-theory]].

This is part of the statement of the *[[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]* (for which there is some [[experiment|experimental]] and [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] support but which, one should admit, remains a [[conjecture]]). 

The idea is that no gentle/[[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] deformation of such a [[topological insulator]]-phase (eg. by changing ambient [[pressure]], tension, [[electric fields]], etc.) can change the "topological" (rather: homotopy-theoretic) class of the [[valence bundle]], and all the material's properties implied by this non-trivial class (notably the nature of its "[[edge modes]]") remain unchanged under such deformation. 

Here the [[equivariance]] is with respect to any or all of: 

1. *spatial* [[crystallographic group|crystallographic point]] symmetries,

1. *non-spatial* symmetries, including:

   1. [[CPT theorem|CPT symmetries]] like [[time-reversal symmetry]],

   1. "[[internal symmetry|internal]]" or "on-site" symmetries 

         (such as [[spin]]-reversal symmetries in systems negligible [[magnetic field]] and [[spin-orbit coupling]])

which all [[group action|act]] on: 

1. the [[Brillouin torus]] and/or

1. the [[quantum observables|observables]] of the system 

   (eg. on the [[Hamiltonian]] by [[complex conjugation]], for the case of [[time-reversal symmetry]]).

If the class of a topological phase of matter crucially depends on its  [[equivariance]] under such [[symmetries]], hence if the phase could/would decay under deformations which (albeit remaining [[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]]) [[symmetry breaking|break]] some of the symmetry, then one speaks of a *[[symmetry protected topological phase]]*. The richness of topological phases all comes from this [[symmetry protected topological phase|symmetry protection]]. 

For instance, without any symmetry protection the [[valence bundles]] in a [[topological insulator]]-[[phase of matter|phase]] of a realistic crystalline material (necessarily of effective dimension $\leq 3$) are characterized entirely by their [[first Chern class]]; one speaks of a *[[Chern insulator]]*-phase. 

If a more fine-grained topological phase is "[[symmetry protected topological phase|protected]]" by [[crystallographic group|crystallographic symmetry]], then one speaks of a *[[topological crystalline insulator]]*-phase, etc.

### Topological semi-metals

More generally, there are topological phases where small [[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] deformations have no effect, as before, but where the [[topological space]] *of possible deformations* has itself a non-trivial [[topological space|topology]], for instance a non-trivial [[fundamental group]], in which case the end result of a  *[[loop]] of deformations* may have the effect of having transformed the system's [[ground state]] by a [[unitary operator]] which depends on the [[homotopy class]] of this loop.

For example, if there is an energy gap *except* over a [[codimension]]$\geq 2$ [[submanifold]] of "band crossings" or "nodal loci" inside the [[Brillouin torus]], where the gap closes right at the [[chemical potential]], then one speaks of a *topological [[semi-metal]]*-phase. 
In this case the [[valence bundle]] is well-defined (only) on the [[complement]] of these "nodal" points, as before, and as such again invariant under gentle deformations, but now these external deformations (which will gently shift the [[energy bands]]) may move the position of the nodal band-crossing points through the [[Brillouin torus]]. 
If a loop of such deformations has the effect of [[braid group|braiding]] these nodal points around each other then it may in total have the effect of having transformed the [[ground state]] by an operation in a [[braid group representation]]. 

If this braiding is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], and/or if the [[holonomy]] of the [[Berry connection]] around the nodal points is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], it follows in particular that the ground state is "degenerate" ("has multiplicity") hence that there is a [[Hilbert space]] of states, all of the ground state energy at the chemical potential, whose [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] is $\geq 2$. In this case one says that the topological phase in addition exhibits *[[topological order]]* or that its ground states exhibits "[[short-range entanglement|long-range entanglement]]" (at least "no [[short-range entanglement]]").

### Topological field theory
 {#TopologicalFieldTheory}

Therefore, in this case of [[topological order]], the [[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] [[dynamics]] of the [[ground state]] of the topological material, say as the nodal points are [[braid group|braided]] around each other, is characterized by:

1. a [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[Hilbert space]] [[space of quantum states]] 

   (the degenerate ground state),

1. a vanishing [[Hamiltonian]] 

   (being the restriction of the full Hamiltonian of the material to its energy=0 eigenstates),

1. global dynamics depending (only) on the "[[topology]]" (really: the [[homotopy type]]) of the trajectory

   (such as on the [[braid group|braid]] formed by the [[worldlines]] of the nodal points).

These are exactly the characteristics of a [[topological field theory]] of the type of [[Chern-Simons theory]], which here one may understand as the tiny but highly interesting subsector "below the gap" of the full non-topological [[quantum field theory]] that describes all the higher excitations of the given material (which is at least as rich as [[quantum electrodynamics]] in the [[background field|background]] of the [[electromagnetic field|Coulomb potential]] of the [[atomic nuclei]] on the crystal sites, see also [here](Dirac+field#FreeDiracFieldInCoulombBackground)).


### Anyons

Generally, it is expected that [[codimension]]=2 [[defects]] in a topological phase  of matter exhibit such a ([[symmetry protected topological order|symmetry protected]]) *[[topological order]]* in that the [[adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] [[braid group|braiding]] of them around each other inside the topological host material is described by a [[topological quantum field theory]] and in particular constitutes a [[braid group representation]] on the systems [[ground state]]. 

In this case one refers to these defects also a *[[anyons]]*. 

The [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|CS-WZW correspondence]] between [[Chern-Simons theory]] and the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]] then predicts that the [[wavefunctions]] that constitute these anyonic ground states in topological phases are given by [[conformal blocks]] of a [[2d CFT]], and it seems that this is indeed the case.

The idea to use the resulting monodromy [[braid representations]] constituted by the [[conformal blocks]] as [[quantum gates]] in a [[quantum computer]] underlies the subject of *[[topological quantum computation]]*.

The technical problem with implementing this and related ideas is that, in general, the energy gap of a topological phase of matter is small, so that it is first of all hard to detect and second it will be hard to *preserve* (hence hard to remain in the topological phase) as one tries to put the "topological properties" of a [[quantum material]] to use.




## Examples
 {#Examples}


### Quantum Hall effect

* [[quantum Hall effect]], [[quantum spin Hall effect]]


### Graphene
 {#ExampleGraphene}
 
The first and archetypical example of all these phenomena is seen in *[[graphene]]*, where a band gap *almost* closes over two nodal *[[Dirac points]]* (up to a tiny shift by the [[spin-orbit coupling]]).


The topological phase/order of graphene is "[[symmetry protected topological phase|symmetry protected]]": 

That this must be the case follows already from the fact that any plain [[complex vector bundle]] (such as the [[valence bundle]] may naively seem to be) is necessarily [[trivial bundle|trivial]] over the [[complement]] of two Dirac points inside the Brillouin [[2-torus]] (a punctured torus, see [[torus#AsAHomotopyType|here]]).
Indeed, the [[dynamics]] of the [[electrons]] in graphene is "$T I$"-symmetric, which forces the valence bundle to be a [[real vector bundle]] with a class not in [[KU-theory]] but in [[KO-theory]], which may be non-trivial over a punctured torus (see at *[[Möbius strip]]*). This non-triviality of the $T I$-symmetric valence bundles is exhibited by non-trivial [[Berry phases]] around the two nodal points.
