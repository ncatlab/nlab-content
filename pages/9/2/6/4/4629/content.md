## Definition

In a [[2-category]], the composition of [[2-morphism]]s along [[object]]s is called _horizontal composition_ .

+-- {: style="text-align:center"}
[[!include horizontal composition - SVG]]
=--

This is in contrast to the [[vertical composition]] of 2-morphisms, which is their composition along 1-[[morphism]]s. 

## Properties

Horizontal and vertical composition are subject to the compatibility condition called the [[interchange law]].

## Examples

* In [[Cat]], horizontal composition is the [[Godement product]] of [[natural transformation]]s.
