## Definition

In a [[2-category]], the composition of [[2-morphisms]] along [[object]]s is called _horizontal composition_ .

This is in contrast to the [[vertical composition]] of 2-morphisms, which is their composition along 1-[[morphism]]s. 

## Properties

Horizontal and vertical composition are subject to the compatibility condition called the [[interchange law]], which in this case and the higher categorical ones means that if we fix three objects $A$, $B$, and $C$ then the composition of 1-cells between them defines a functor.

## Examples

* In [[Cat]], horizontal composition is the [[Godement product]] of [[natural transformation]]s.
