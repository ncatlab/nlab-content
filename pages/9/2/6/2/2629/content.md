A 'structure type' is a type of [[structure]] that can placed on finite sets, e.g. a coloring, or ordering.  To make this precise, we define a __structure type__ to be a faithful functor

$$X \to core(FinSet)$$

from some groupoid $X$ to [[core]]([[FinSet]]), which is the groupoid of finite sets and bijections.  Equivalently, we can think of it as a [[presheaf]] of sets on the groupoid of finite sets and bijections, or in other words a functor

$$core(FinSet)^{op} \to Set $$

But since a groupoid is equivalent to its opposite, we can also think of it as a faithful functor

$$core(FinSet) \to Set $$

In this guise, a structure type is more commonly called a __(combinatorial) species of structure__, or [[species]] for short.  

A structure type is a special case of a [[stuff type]], so read about 'stuff types' for more information.
