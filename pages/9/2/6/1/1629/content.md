## Definition

A **homeomorphism** (also spelt 'homoeomorphism' and 'hom&#339;omorphism' but *not* 'homomorphism') is an [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]].

That is, a homeomorphism $f : X \to Y$ is a [[continuous map]] of [[topological spaces]] such that there is an [[inverse]] $f^{-1}: Y \to X $ that is also a continuous map of topological spaces.  Equivalently, $f$ is a [[bijection]] between the underlying sets such that both $f$ and its inverse are continuous.

For more see at _[[Introduction to Topology -- 1]]_ the section _[Homeomorphisms](Introduction+to+Topology -- 1#Homeomorphisms)_.


The term 'homeomorphism' is also applied to isomorphisms in categories that generalise $Top$, such as the category of [[convergence spaces]] and the category of [[locales]].

## Counter-examples

Beware that a continous [[bijection]] is not necessarily a homeomorphism; that is, $Top$ is not a [[balanced category]].

For example $\exp(2\pi i(-)) [0,1) \to S^1$ is continuous and the underlying function of sets is a [[bijection]], but the inverse function at the level of sets is not continuous.
