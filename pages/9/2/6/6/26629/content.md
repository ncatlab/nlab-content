## Idea

A **double fibration**, or **fibration of double categories** is the appropriate analogue of [[Grothendieck fibration]] for [[double categories]]. There are several equivalent definitions; see the references.

When the source and target are known as double categories, the adjunct "double" can be omitted, as with a [[double functor]].  Also note that unlike a double category, but like a double functor, a double fibration is not a "fibration in the category of fibrations".
