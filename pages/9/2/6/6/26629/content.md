## Idea

A **fibration of double categories** is the appropriate analogue of [[Grothendieck fibration]] for [[double categories]]. There are several equivalent definitions; see the references.

In some of the literature, fibrations of double categories are referred to as **double fibrations**. However, this terminology is awkward for several reasons: it is typically redundant to specify "double" when we are talking of functors between double categories, and **double _X_** has an existing meaning in the theory of [[sketches]] (i.e. an _X_ in the category of _X_s).
