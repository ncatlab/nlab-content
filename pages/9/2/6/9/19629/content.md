## Idea

In [[string theory]] the _Goddard-Thorn theorem_ ([Goddard-Thorn 72](#GoddardThorn72), [Thorn 87](#Thorn87), [Thorn 12](#Thorn12)) establishes the consistency of the usual [[quantization]] of the [[bosonic string]] [[sigma-model]] for [[target space]] [[dimension]] 26, and of the [[NSR string|NSR]] [[superstring]] [[sigma-model]] for [[target space]] [[dimension]] 10.

In the original "old covariant quantization" approach to this problem the proof amounts to demonstrating that the [[inner product]] on the would-be [[Hilbert space]] of [[quantum states]] is indeed [[positive definite]]. Since would-be [[quantum states]] of [[negative number|negative]] [[norm]] have been known as "ghost states", the theorem has become widely known as the _no-ghost theorem_ of [[string theory]]. More modern derivations proceed via or compare to [[quantization]] via the [[BRST complex]] of the string [[sigma-model]].

In particular the theorem thus establishes the [[superstring]] excitations of vanishing [[mass]], and that (after [[GSO projection]]) these coincide with the quanta of [[perturbative quantum gravity|perturbative]] [[supergravity]] in 10 dimensions ([[type IIA supergravity]] or [[type IIB supergravity]]).
