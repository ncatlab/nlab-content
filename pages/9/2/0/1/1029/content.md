Two [[morphism]]s $f, g$ in a [[category]] $C$ are called **parallel** if they have the same [[source]] and [[target]] [[object]]s:

$$
  f,g : c \to d
  \,.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: This page duplicates [[parallel morphisms]].  It might seem like the name of this page is more in line with the naming conventions, but one can also object that it doesn't make sense to talk about "a parallel morphism," only "a parallel _pair_ of morphisms."  Thoughts?
