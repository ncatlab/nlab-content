## Idea

A _multi trace observable_ is a [[polynomial]] in [[single trace operators]] (see there for more background).

## Properties

### As Lie weight systems in BMN matrix model
 {#AsLieWeightSystemsInBMNModel}

The [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] and [[rotation]]-[[invariant]] multi trace observables of the $N \times N$-[[BMN matrix model]] are precisely the values of [[special unitary Lie algebra|su(N)]]-[[Lie algebra weight systems]] on [[Sullivan chord diagrams]], namely on [[all horizontal weight systems are partitioned Lie algebra weight systems|permuted closures]] of [[horizontal chord diagrams]]:
