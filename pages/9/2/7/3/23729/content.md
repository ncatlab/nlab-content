## Idea

In [[solid state physics]] an *insulator* is a [[crystal|crystalline]] material for which the [[chemical potential]] of the [[electrons]] is inside a sizeable [[energy gap]] between the [[valence band]] and the [[conduction band]]. (If there is a gap but just a small one, one speaks of a *[[semi-conductor]]*, instead.)

This situation implies that for net [[electric charge]] to be transported through the material (hence for it to become a [[conductor]]) an energy density above the gap width has to be applied from the outside, in order to lift electron states from the [[valence bundle]] to the [[conduction bundle]], where they can then propagate. Below this energy density the material hence resists the transport of electric current.

Due to the energy gap, the [[valence bundle]] of an insulator is well-defined. If this has a non-trivial class in ([[twisted equivariant K-theory|twisted equivariant]]) [[topological K-theory]] of the [[Brillouin torus]], one speaks of a *[[topological insulator]]* (see at *[[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]*).
