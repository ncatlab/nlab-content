A **Fuchsian (differential) equation** is a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with analytic coefficients in the complex domain whose all singular points are **regular** singular points. [[Riemann-Hilbert problem|Riemann 21st problem]] is concerned with finding a Fuchsian equation with prescribed points of singularities and prescribed monodromies. The corresponding connection is also called Fuchsian.
