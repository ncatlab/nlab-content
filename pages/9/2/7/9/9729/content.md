In mathematics, a [[highly structured ring spectrum]] or ∞-ring is an object in [[homotopy theory]] encoding a refinement of a multiplicative structure on a [[cohomology theory]]. A commutative version of an ∞-ring is called an [[E-∞ ring]]. While originally motivated by questions of geometric topology and bundle theory, they are today most often used in [[stable homotopy theory]].
