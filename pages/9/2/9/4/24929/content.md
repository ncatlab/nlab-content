## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[algebra]], a *subring* is a [[subobject]] of a [[ring]], i.e. a [[subobject]] of an [[object]] in the [[category]] [[Ring]] of rings with [[homomorphisms]] between them.

As usual, there is a little bit of variation of what exactly one takes to be the definition of "ring" (multiplicative [[unital magma|unitality]] is usually understood by default, while [[commutative ring|commutativity]] is usually not assumed by default) but in each case the general notion of [[subobject]] reduces to the appropriare notion of subring. For instance, a subring in the category of unital rings necessarily contains the [[unit]]-element of the ambient ring, etc.
