A [[group]] is a special sort of [[category]], and the **group algebra** (denoted $k[G]$ or $k G$) of a group $G$ is just the [[category algebra]] of this category. 

The group algebra is always a [[Hopf algebra]].

Sometimes instead of working over a [[ground field]] $k$, one allows $k$ to be a [[commutative unital ring]]. Then we talk about __group ring__ (though it is in fact a commutative unital $k$-[[commutative unital algebra|algebra]]). The integer group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ is the most important example, extensively used in the [[representation theory]] of finite groups.
