## Idea

A **reflection principle** is roughly a statement or formula (scheme) that expresses the idea that a certain logical object contains copies of itself. They play an important role in different guises in several fields of [[mathematical logic]] e.g. in [[set theory]], [[proof theory]], [[type theory]] and, recently, [[constructive analysis]].

G&#246;del's encoding of an unprovability predicate into [[Peano arithmetic]] $PA$ can be viewed as an _'anti-reflection'_ principle for $PA$. Conversely, this suggests that the validity of reflection principles for some theory $T$ can be informally understood as expressing or approximating the (internal) _consistency_ and _completeness_ of $T$.


### Set-theoretic reflection principles

A _reflection principle_ in [[set theory]] states that it is possible to find [[sets]] that resemble the [[class]] of all sets that are constructed in some ways; in other words, any statement true of the universe $V$ already holds at some initial segment $V_\alpha$. This can be interpreted as saying that no first-order property can distinguish the set-theoretic universe from the extensions of all its member sets thereby suggesting the _expansiveness_ or strong infinity of the universe: $V$ gets 'arbitrarily large'.

The first reflection principles go back to [[Richard Montague|R. Montague]] and A. L&#233;vy around 1960. It emerged from their work that reflection principles can supplant the traditional axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]], e.g. the [[axiom of replacement]] (cf. [Bell-Machover 1977](#BellMach77), p.495). This capacity and the intuition that they express 'completeness' make them interesting candidates in the quest for new axioms of set theory (cf. [Koellner 2009](#Koell09)).

### Universes in type theory

In [[type theory]] this principle is embodied by a [[type of types]] ([Martin-L&#246;f 74, p. 6](#MartinLoef74)).
