## Idea

A central result in the construction of [[perturbative quantum field theories]] via the method of [[causal perturbation theory]] is called the _main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory_. This says that any two _[[renormalization]] schemes_, hence any two solutions to the inductive construction of the [[S-matrix]] $V \mapsto S(V)$ for [[interaction]] terms $V$, are related by a unique transformation $Z \colon V \mapsto V'$

$$
  S' = S \circ Z
  \,.
$$

The collection of these operations $Z$ forms a [[group]] called the _[[St端ckelberg-Peterson renormalization group]]_. Hence the space of renormalization schemes is a [[torsor]] over this group.

This theorem is a mathematical reflection of the idea that renormalization is about regarding a [[perturbative quantum field theory]] with [[interaction]] $V$ as a [[effective field theory]] at some energy scale and then discovering that at higher energy there is a more fundamental interaction $Z(V)$ which effectively looks like $V$ at lower energy.
