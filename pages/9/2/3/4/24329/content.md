## Idea

The Feynman–Kac formula expresses the [[integral kernel]] of the [[one-parameter semigroup]] generated by a [[Laplacian]] on a [[smooth manifold]]
as the [[path integral]] of the [[parallel transport]] map associated to the given [[connection]] with respect to all paths of a given length connecting the two given points.
