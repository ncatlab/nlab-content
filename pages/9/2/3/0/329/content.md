#Idea

* A strict 2-category is a [[directed n-graph|directed 2-graph]] equipped with a composition operation on adjacent 1-cells and 2-cells which is strictly unital and associative.

* The concept of a strict 2-category is the simplest generalization of a [[category]] to a [[higher category theory|higher category]]. It is the one-step [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of the concept of a category.

#Definition

A _strict 2-category_, often called simply a _2-category_, is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] [[Cat]].  



#Remarks

* A strict 2-category is the same as an [[omega-category]] which is trivial in degree $n \geq 3$.

* This is to be contrasted with a _weak 2-category_ called a [[bicategory]]. In a strict 2-category composition of 1-morphisms is strictly associative and comoposition with [[identity]] morphisms strictly satisfies the required identity law. In a weak 2-category these laws may hold only up to coherent 2-morphisms.
