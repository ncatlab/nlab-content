A __locally ringed space__ is a [[ringed space]] $(X,\mathcal{O})$ such that the [[stalks]] of the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}$ are [[local ring]]s. 

The morphism of locally ringed space is a morphism of ringed spaces $(f,f^\sharp):(X,\mathcal{O}_X)\to (Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ where $f:X\to Y$, such that the [[comorphism]] $f^\sharp:\mathcal{O}_Y\to f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a map of [[local rings]] (that is, the map of rings which respects the [[maximal ideal]]).
