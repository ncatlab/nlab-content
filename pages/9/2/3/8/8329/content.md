## Idea

According to _[[Science of Logic]]_ ([SoL &#167;152](Science+of+Logic#152), [Lawvere 91, p. 11](#Lawvere91)) "becoming" is the [[unity of opposites]] of [[nothing]] and [[being]]. The reverse is _[[ceasing]]_. The [[Aufhebung]] of both is [[Dasein]]:

| |  | [[Dasein]] | |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [[becoming]] : | [[nothing]] | $\;\;\;\dashv$ | [[being]] | : [[ceasing]] |


The universal factorization via $\emptyset$-[[unit of a monad|unit]] and $\ast$-[[counit of a comonad]]:

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \ast 
    \\
    \\
    nothing && becoming && being
  }
$$

of the unique [[function]] from the [[empty type]] to the [[unit type]] through any other [[type]] $X$.

Indeed, this is the statement of [SoL &#167;174](Science+of+Logic#174): _there is nothing which is not an intermediate state between being and nothing._
