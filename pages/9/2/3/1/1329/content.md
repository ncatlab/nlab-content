#Idea#

The _hypercompletion_ ([[Higher Topos Theory|Lu]]) or _$t$-completion_ ([ToVe](http://poincare.dma.unifi.it/~vezzosi/papers/msri.pdf))of an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] of [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-sheaves]] is a further localization/[[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-sheafification]] which corresponds to retaining only those [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]] which satisfy [[descent]] with respect to all [[hypercover]]s.

#Definition#

**Definition [p. 530](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=530) of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]]**

An [[(infinity,1)-topos]] of [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-sheaves]] is **hypercomplete**  if every [[infinity-connective morphism]] is an equivalence.

##Remarks##

Notice that in [section 6.5.4](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=539) of [[Higher Topos Theory]] it is argued that it may be more natural _not_ to pass to the hypercompletion of a given $(\infty,1)$-topos.



#Examples#

* The $(\infty,1)$-category defined by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] is the hypercmpletion of the localizatoin of simplicial presheaves at ordinary covers. For more details see [[descent for simplicial presheaves]].
