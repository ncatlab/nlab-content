## Definition

A [[Kan fibration]] that at the same time is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] is called an **acyclic Kan fibration**. (Also: a _trivial Kan fibration_.)

## Properties

Acyclic Kan fibrations are the [[acyclic fibrations]] in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] $sSet_{Qu}$, hence those morphisms which have the [[right lifting property]] against [[monomorphisms]] (degreewise [[injections]]) of [[simplicial sets]].

\begin{remark}\label{AcyclicKanFibrationsAreSurjective}
 In particular, this implies that acyclic Kan fibrations are always (in particular: degreewise) [[surjective]] in that they have right lifting against any [[empty bundle]] $\varnothing \xhookrightarrow{\;} S$ (as opposed to plain [[Kan fibrations]], see [this remark](horn#ZeroSimplexHasNoHorns)).
\end{remark}

In fact:
\begin{prop}
Acyclic Kan fibrations are precisely the morphisms of [[simplicial sets]] that have the [[right lifting property]] against all [[boundary of a simplex|simplex boundary inclusions]].
\end{prop}
See [this Prop.](classical+model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#AcyclicKanFibrationsAsRLPAgainstBoundaryInclusions) at *[[classical model structure on simplicial sets]]*.
This is part of the statement that $sSet_{Qu}$  is a [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] (see [this Prop.](classical+model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#AsACofibrantlyGeneratedModelCategory)).
