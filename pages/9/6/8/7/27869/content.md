## Idea

For a scalar function, a curve whose derivative is opposite to its [[gradient]] is called a *gradient flow*. It always points down the way of steepest descent and hence is monotonically descreasing with respect to the scalar function. It is then possible to study its convergence to [[critical points]], especially those that are [[local minima]].

If the scalar function is the *Seiberg-Witten action functional*, then the gradient flow is called *Seiberg-Witten flow*. It is described by the [[Seiberg-Witten equation]] and can be used to find solutions of the [[Seiberg-Witten equations]], which are the critical points.

The [[Seiberg-Witten flow]] is named after [[Nathan Seiberg]] und [[Edward Witten]], who introduced [[Seiberg-Witten theory]] in 1994.
