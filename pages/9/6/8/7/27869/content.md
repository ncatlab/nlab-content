## Idea

For a [[scalar]]-valued [[function]], a [[curve]] whose [[derivative]] is the negative of its [[gradient]] is called a *[[gradient flow]]*. It always points down the direction of [[steepest descent]] and hence is [[monotone function|monotonically descreasing]] with respect to the scalar function. It is then possible to study its [[convergence]] to [[critical points]], especially those that are [[local minima]].

If the scalar function is the *Seiberg-Witten action functional*, then the gradient flow is called *Seiberg-Witten flow*. It is described by the [[Seiberg-Witten equation]] and can be used to find solutions of the [[Seiberg-Witten equations]], which are the critical points.

The [[Seiberg-Witten flow]] is named after [[Nathan Seiberg]] und [[Edward Witten]], who introduced [[Seiberg-Witten theory]] in 1994.
