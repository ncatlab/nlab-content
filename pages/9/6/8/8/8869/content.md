## Idea

Classical Bergmann-Segal transform is a [[unitary transformation]] from the position Hilbert space of Lebesgue square integrable functions $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to the [[Bargmann-Fock space]] of analytic function with certain growth condition. 

This can be obtained from the point of view of [[coherent state]]s. Vectors in the Hilbert space can be represented in the coherent state representation: $|f\rangle = \int |z\rangle\langle z|f\rangle d\mu$; if $f$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ then $\langle z|f\rangle$ is a holomorphic function and this passage is called the Bargmann-Segal transform (referring to [Irving Segal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Segal)); this way a Hilbert space of holomorphic function appears, the [[Bargmann-Fock space]].

Bergmann-Segal transform is therefore an integral transform whose kernel is the overlap between the projective measure corresponding to the coherent states and a measure corresponding to an orthonormal basis coming from some polarization for $L^2$-sections. The kernel is a special case of a [[Bergman kernel]] in complex analysis.
