## Idea

Algebraic number theory studies [[algebraic numbers]], [[number fields]] and related [[algebra|algebraic]] structures. 

An [[algebraic number]] is a [[root]] of a [[polynomial]] [[equation]] with [[integer]] coefficients (or, equivalently with [[rational number|rational]] coeffients). An [[algebraic integer]] is a root of a [[monic polynomial]] with integer coefficients. Given a [[field]] $k$ a (algebraic) __[[number field]]__ $K = k[P]$ over $k$ is the minimal [[field]] containing all the roots of a given polynomial $P$ with coefficients in $k$. Usually one considers algebraic number fields over rational numbers. 

The main direction in algebraic number theory is the [[class field theory]] which roughly studies finite abelian extensions of number fields. The one dimensional class field theory stems from the ideas of Kronecker and Weber, and results of Hilbert soon after them. Main results of the theory belong to the first half of the 20th century (Hilbert, Artin, Tate, Hasse...) and are quite different for the [[local field]] from the [[global field]] case. Generalizations for higher dimensional fields came later under now active higher class field theory, which is usually formulated in terms of algebraic K-theory and is closely related to deep questions of algebraic geometry (Tate, Kato, Saito etc.).
