## Idea

**$Lex$** is a widely used name for the [[2-category]] of:

* [[small category|small]]$\;$[[finitely complete categories]], 

* [[left exact functor|finite-limit-preserving functors]] between these, and 

* [[natural transformations]] between those.

In [[categorical logic]], such categories are also known as *finite limits theories* or *[[essentially algebraic theories]]*.  Finite-limit-preserving functors are also known as *[[left exact functors]]* or **lex functors**, and these give $Lex$ its name.
