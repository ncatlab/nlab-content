**$Lex$** is a widely used name for the [[2-category]] of:

* [[small category|small]] [[finitely complete categories]], 

* [[left exact functor|finite-limit-preserving functors]] between these, and 

* [[natural transformations]] between those.

In [[categorical logic]], such categories are also known as **finite limits theories** or [[essentially algebraic theories]].  Finite-limit-preserving functors are also known as [[left exact functor|left exact functors]] or **lex functors**, and these give $Lex$ its name.
