## Idea

A _ring spectrum_ is a model for an [[A-∞ ring]].

The notion of [[spectrum]] is the generalization of the notion of [[abelian group]] to [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]]. The notion of **ring spectrum** is the corresponding generalization of the notion of [[ring]].

## Defnition

A _ring spectrum_ is a [[monoid]] in the [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho(\mathcal{S})$ equipped with the [[smash product of spectra]]. See there for more details.

This means that a ring spectrum is a monoid in the category $\mathcal{S}$ of [[spectrum|spectra]] up to not-necessarily coherent [[homotopy]].

A monoid-up-to-homotopy in the category of spectra for which the homotopies are coherent is called an $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity ring specturm|ring spectrum]] or just an $A_\infty$-[[A-∞ ring|ring]]. These may be modeled as [[monoid]]s with respect to the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].

## Properties

Not every ring spectrum may be refined to an $A_\infty$-ring spectrum.
