## Idea

Higher monadic descent is the generalization of the notion of [[monadic descent]] from [[category theory]] to [[higher category theory]]. It relates to the [[descent]] of [[∞-stacks]] as ordinary monad descent relates to [[stack]]s.

See also [[cohomological descent]].

## Examples

### Amitsur complex, Sweedler corings, Hopf algebroids
 {#AmitsurComplex}

For $\phi \colon B \longrightarrow A$ a [[homomorphism]]
of suitable [[monoids]], there is the corresponding pull-push [[adjunction]] 
([[extension of scalars]] $\dashv$ [[restriction of scalars]]) on [[categories of modules]]


$$
  ((- )\otimes_B A \dashv \phi^\ast )
  \;\colon\;
   Mod_A
    \stackrel{\overset{(-)\otimes_B A}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\phi^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}
   Mod_B
  \,.
$$

The [[bar construction]] of the corresponding [[monad]] is the corresponding [[Amitsur complex]].

(e.g. [Hess 10, section 6](#Hess10))

A monadicity theorem for [[2-monad|pseudomonads]] is proved in

In [[2-category]]-theory, a notion of 2-[[fibered category|fibered categories]] are defined in Gray's work and then again introduced and discussed at length by Claudio Hermida, who has good ideas on higher n (and I will be trilled to hear once that he found the time to return to the topic and give us good answers). An appendix in

is discussing a 2-categorical version of Beck-Chevalley condition needed to compare it with the 2-monadic descent; there is also a version of Beck's theorem sketched there.

Unfortunately, [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]]'s [[monadicity theorem]] (July 2004) which is in the setup of [[A-infinity category|A-∞-categories]], still remains unpublished. The [[triangulated category|triangulated]] version is in Rosenberg's lectures

Its proof is based on [[Verdier's abelianization functor]].
