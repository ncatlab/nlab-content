## Idea

Higher monadic descent is the generalization of the notion of [[monadic descent]] from [[category theory]] to [[higher category theory]]. It relates to the [[descent]] of [[∞-stack]]s as ordinary monad descent relates to [[stack]]s.

### 2-categorical monadic descent

In [[2-category]]-theory, a notion of 2-[[fibered category|fibered categories]] are defined in Gray's work and then again introduced and discussed at length by Claudio Hermida, who has good ideas on higher n (and I will be trilled to hear once that he found the time to return to the topic and give us good answers). An appendix in

is discussing a 2-categorical version of Chevalley condition (truly, the subtle historical and terminological differences between B-R vs Beck contributions for 1d case are not made there).
