## Idea

Higher monadic descent is the generalization of the notion of [[monadic descent]] from [[category theory]] to [[higher category theory]]. It relates to the [[descent]] of [[∞-stack]]s as ordinary monad descent relates to [[stack]]s.

### 2-categorical monadic descent

A monadicity theorem for [[2-monad|pseudomonads]] is proved in

In [[2-category]]-theory, a notion of 2-[[fibered category|fibered categories]] are defined in Gray's work and then again introduced and discussed at length by Claudio Hermida, who has good ideas on higher n (and I will be trilled to hear once that he found the time to return to the topic and give us good answers). An appendix in

is discussing a 2-categorical version of Beck-Chevalley condition needed to compare it with the 2-monadic descent; there is also a version of Beck's theorem sketched there.
