## Injective-on-objects functors

A [[functor]] between [[strict categories]] is called **injective-on-objects** if its object-[[function]] is [[injective function|injective]]. 

Injective-on-objects functors are exactly 

* the [[isocofibrations]] in $Cat$ 

* the [[cofibrations]] in the [[canonical model structure on categories]] (also in the [[canonical model structure on groupoids]]).
