## Idea

Since every [[ordered reduced local ring]] $R$ has [[characteristic zero]], the positive integers $\mathbb{Z}_+$ are a subset of $R$, with [[injection]] $i:\mathbb{Z}_+ \hookrightarrow R$. An **Archimedean ordered reduced local ring** is an [[ordered reduced local ring]] which satisfies the [[archimedean property]]: for all elements $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then there exists a positive integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that such that $a \lt i(n) \cdot b$. 

An important class of Archimedean ordered reduced local rings are [[Archimedean ordered local integral domains]], which are used in [[differential geometry]] and [[analysis]] to define [[analytic functions]] in the same way that [[Archimedean ordered Artinian local rings]] are used to define [[smooth functions]]. [[Archimedean ordered fields]] are the Archimedean ordered reduced local rings in which every non-invertible element is nilpotent, or equivalently, in which every non-invertible element is equal to zero.
