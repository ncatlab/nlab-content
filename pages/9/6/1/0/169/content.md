[[2-spectral triple|Recall]] that from a 2-dimensional [[CFT]] one induces a (generalized) _target space_ geometry in generalization of how a [[spectral triple]] induces such a generalized geometry.

From category-algebraic considerations one obtains [[defect line]]s in 2-d [[CFT]], which are encoded by bimodules as [brane]s are encoded by modules. **Bi-branes** are the answer to the question: "What is the target space structure corresponding to defect lines in the 2d CFT"?

For certain 2-d CFTs based on current algebras the bi-branes corresponding to certain defect lines in these theories have been introduced and discussed in

##In WZW theories##

It is found that, just as symmetric conformal branes in WZW models, whose target space is a Lie group $G$, correspond to 
submanifolds of $G$ given by conjugacy classes in $G$, bi-branes in WZW model correspond to [[span]]s or _correspondences_

where $B$ is a [[higher group characters|biconjugacy class]] of $G$.
