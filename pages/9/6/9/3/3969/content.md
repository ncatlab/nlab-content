## Idea

The notion of smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebra is the analog in [[higher category theory]] of [[smooth algebra]]. This is the basis for the [[derived geometry]] version of [[differential geometry]]/[[synthetic differential geometry]].

## Definition

A **smooth $\infty$-algebra** is an [[∞-algebra over an (∞,1)-algebraic theory]] $T$ for $T$ the ordinary [[Lawvere theory]] of [[smooth algebra]]s.

## Properties

The [[model structure on simplicial algebras]] on [[simplicial C-∞-ring]] is a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] for smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras.

## Applications

Smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras appear as the algebras of functions in [[derived differential geometry]], for instance on [[derived smooth manifolds]].
