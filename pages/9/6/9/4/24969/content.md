## Idea

Emergentism is a philosophical position which states that all of that field cannot be reduced to a common foundation. 

This contrasts with [[reductionism]], which says that the entire field can be reduced to a common foundation. 

## Emergentism in physics

Emergentism in [[physics]], which arose in response to the position of [[reductionism]], which states that all of physics could be reduced to one basic universal theory. 

In practice, emergentism is true, because even if one were to say the [[standard model of particle physics]] were to validate the reductionist paradigm, the Standard Model is so complex that particle physicists have not been able to model the dynamics of a single proton from the Standard Model, let alone the dynamics of molecules, chemical reactions, condensed matter systems, and galaxies. And furthermore, the complexity means that it is likely that even if humans could characterize such phenomena entirely based upon the Standard Model, it might be too long and complex for a single human to understand during their lifetime. This means that in practice, physicists usually have different theories for each different general phenomena; the [[quantum field theories]] used in [[condensed matter physics]] are [[effective field theories]] different from the Standard Model, and the models used in molecular chemistry and galactic physics aren't quantum field theories at all.
