On [[Yang-Mills theory]] ([[gauge theory]]) being about [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[principal bundles]]/[[fiber bundles]]:

Yang wrote in  _C. N. Yang, Selected papers, 1945-1980, with commentary_, W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1983, on p. 567:

> In 1975, impressed with the fact that [[gauge fields]] are [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[fiber bundles]], I drove to the house of [[Shiing-shen Chern|S. S. Chern]] in El Cerrito, near Berkeley... I said I found it amazing that [[gauge theory]] are exactly [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[fiber bundles]], which the mathematicians developed without reference to the physical world. I added: "this is both thrilling and puzzling, since you mathematicians dreamed up these concepts out of nowhere." He immediately protested: "No, no. These concepts were not dreamed up. They were natural and real."

Yang expanded on this passage in an interview recorded as

* D. Z. Zhang,  _C. N. Yang and contemporary mathematics_, The Mathematical Intelligencer 15, 13–21 (1993) ([doi:10.1007/BF03024319](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03024319)):

> $[$This$]$ was not just joy. There was something more, something deeper: After all, what could be more mysterious, what could be more awe-inspiring, than to find that the structure of the [[observable universe|physical world]] is intimately tied to the deep [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts, concepts which were developed out of considerations rooted only in [[logic]] and the beauty of form?
