#Definition#

A [[functor]] from a [[category]] to itself is called an **endofunctor**.

Given any category $C$, the [[functor category]] 

$$End(C) = C^C $$

is called the **endofunctor category** of $C$.  The objects of $End(C)$ are endofunctors $F: C \to C$, and the morphisms are natural transformations between such endofunctors.  The endofunctor category is a [[monoidal category]], thanks to our ability to compose endofunctors.
