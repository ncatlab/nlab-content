## Idea

Just as an ordinary [[topos]] comes with its [[internal logic]], and [[(∞,1)-topos]] should come with its _internal $(\infty,1)$-logic_ .

Not much is known about this yet. But below are some references that go in this direction.

## References

A discussion of the internal logic of a 2-topos is beginning to appear in

* [[Mike Shulman]], _[[michaelshulman:2-categorical logic]]_

A model for something like an $(\infty,1)$-[[type theory]] (but as yet without the corresponding logic) is described in

* [[Steve Awodey]], [[Michael Warren]], _Homotopy theoretic models of identity types_ ([arXiv:math/0709.0248](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0248))

[[Vladimir Voevodsky]] has also been thinking about what additional type-theoretic axioms are satisfied in $(\infty,1)$-models; his "equivalence axiom" seems to be closely related to the [[object classifier]]s in an $(\infty,1)$-topos.  Some references can be found at
