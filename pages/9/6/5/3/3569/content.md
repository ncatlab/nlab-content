## Idea

Just as an ordinary [[topos]] comes with its [[internal logic]], and [[(∞,1)-topos]] should come with its _internal $(\infty,1)$-logic_ .

Not much is known about this yet. But below are some references that go in this direction.

## Examples

### Internal logic in $\infty Grpd$ {#OfInfGrpd}

The archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] is [[∞Grpd]]. This is to be thought of as the [[vertical categorification|(∞,1)-categorification]] of the archetypical 1-[[topos]] [[Set]].

At [internal logic - in Set](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+logic#LogicOfSet) is a step-by-step discussion of how ordinary logic is recovered from the point of view of the [[internal logic]] of a topos $\mathcal{T}$ when  choosing $\mathcal{T} := Set$.

Here we look at the $(\infty,1)$-categoried analog of that discussion,  step-by-step, now everything internal to [[∞Grpd]].

So...

> (...please fill in what comes next, if you have an idea...)

First we need equivalents for 1, the terminal object, and 2, the subobject classifier. Can the terminal $\infty$-groupoid work as a generator?

## References

A discussion of the internal logic of a 2-topos is beginning to appear in

A model for something like an $(\infty,1)$-[[type theory]] (but as yet without the corresponding logic) is described in

[[Vladimir Voevodsky]] has also been thinking about what additional type-theoretic axioms are satisfied in $(\infty,1)$-models; his "equivalence axiom" seems to be closely related to the [[object classifier]]s in an $(\infty,1)$-topos.  Some references can be found at
