There are many principles in mathematics called 'extensionality'; what these principles all have in common are that they all characterize the notion of [[equality]] in that [[collection]]. Examples include

* [[function extensionality]] (for functions)

* [[equivalence extensionality]] (for equivalences)

* [[sequence extensionality]] (for sequences)

* [[tuple extensionality]] (for tuples)

* [[product extensionality]] (for products/pairs)

* [[univalence]]/[[universe extensionality]] (for small types of universes)

* [[propositional extensionality]] (for propositions)

* [[axiom of extensionality]] (for pure sets)

* [[extensional type theory]] (for terms, uses [[definitional equality]] for the extensionality condition)

There are other notions in mathematics which could be considered to be an extensionality principle. Examples include

* [[extensional relations]] and [[bisimulation]]

* [[antisymmetry]] (for elements of a [[poset]])

* [[connected relation|connectedness]] (for elements of a [[strict total order]])

* [[separation axiom]] (for elements of a [[Kolmogorov topological space]])

* [[Rezk completion]] (for [[objects]] of a [[category]] or [[(infinity,1)-category]])
