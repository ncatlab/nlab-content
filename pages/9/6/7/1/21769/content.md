## Definition

$FinRel$ is the [[category]] of [[finite sets]] and all [[relations]] between them: the [[full subcategory]] of [[Rel]] on finite sets.  Like [[Rel]], [[FinRel]] can also be seen as a [[2-poset]], and a [[cartesian bicategory]].



## Properties


### As a category of matrices

$FinRel$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $Mat(Bool)$, the category whose [[objects]] are [[natural numbers]] and where a [[morphism]] $f \colon m \to n$ is an $n \times m$ [[matrix]] with entries in the [[semiring]] of [[booleans]], $Bool = \{F,T\}$, where [[addition]] is the logical operation "[[logical disjunction|or]]" and [[multiplication]] is "[[logical conjunction|and]]".  

For any semiring $R$, the category $Mat(R)$ has [[biproducts]], corresponding to addition of natural numbers, and the [[initial object]] $0$ is also [[terminal object|terminal]] (hence is a [[zero object]]).  For any [[commutative magma|commutative]] semiring $R$, $Mat(R)$ also has another [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]]: a [[tensor product]] with $m \otimes n = m n$, which [[distributivity|distributes]] over biproducts.  Thus $FinRel$ has all these properties.   



### As a PROP

We can define [[bimonoids]] in any [[symmetric monoidal category]]: roughly, a bimonoid is a [[monoid]] and [[comonoid]] in a compatible way.  A bimonoid is said to be **special** if comultiplication followed by multiplication is the [[identity]], and **bicommutative** if it is both a [[commutative monoid]] and a [[cocommutative comonoid]].  

In a category with [[biproducts]] and a [[zero object]], every object $c$ is a bicommutative bimonoid where the multiplication is the [[fold map]] $\nabla \colon c \oplus c \to c$ and the comultiplication is the [[diagonal]] $\Delta \colon c \to c \oplus c$.  Thus, every object of $FinRel$ is a bicommutative bimonoid.  One can easily check that it is also special.

But something stronger is true.  $FinRel$ made symmetric monoidal with biproducts is the *[[free construction|free]]* symmetric monoidal category on a special bicommutative bimonoid.  That is, given a symmetric monoidal category $C$ and a special bicommutative bimonoid object $c \in C$, there is symmetric [[monoidal functor]] $F \colon FinRel \to C$, unique up to monoidal [[natural isomorphism]], mapping $1 \in FinRel$ together with its bimonoid operations to $c$ and its bimonoid operations.

This is conveniently expressed in the language of [[PROPs]]: $Mat(Bool)$ is the PROP for special bicommutative bimonoids.   This is Theorem 7.2 in [Coya-Fong 17](#CoyaFong17), based on techniques from [Lack 04](#Lack04).
