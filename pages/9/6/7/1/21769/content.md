## Definition

$FinRel$ is the [[category]] of [[finite set]]s and all [[relation]]s between them: the [[full subcategory]] of [[Rel]] on finite sets.  Like [[Rel]], [[FinRel]] can also be seen as a [[2-poset]], and a [[cartesian bicategory]].

## As a category of matrices

$FinRel$ is isomorphic to $Mat(Bool)$, the category where the objects are natural numbers and a morphism $f : m \to n$ is an $n \times m$ matrix with entries in the [[semiring]] of booleans, $Bool = \{F,T\}$, where addition is the logical operation "or" and multiplication is "and".  For any semiring $R$, the category $Mat(R)$ has [[biproducts]], corresponding to addition of natural numbers, and the initial object $0$ is also terminal.  For any commutative semiring $R$, $Mat(R)$ also has another symmetric monoidal structure, a tensor product with $m \otimes n = m n$, which distributes over biproducts.  Thus FinRel has all these properties.   

## As a PROP

We can define [[bimonoid]]s in any symmetric monoidal category: roughly, a bimonoid is a [[monoid]] and [[comonoid]] in a compatible way.  A bimonoid is said to be **special** if comultiplication followed by multiplication is the identity, and **bicommutative** if it is both a [[commutative monoid]] and a [[cocommutative comonoid]].  

In a category with biproducts and an object that is both initial and terminal, every object $c$ is a bicommutative bimonoid where the multiplication is the fold map $\nabla \colon c \oplus c \to c$ and the comultiplication is the diagonal $\Delta \colon c \to c \oplus c$.  Thus, every object of $FinRel$ is a bicommutative bimonoid.  One can easily check that it is also special.

But something stronger is true.  $FinRel$ made symmetric monoidal with biproducts is the *free* symmetric monoidal category on a special bicommutative bimonoid.  That is, given a symmetric monoidal category $C$ and a special bicommutative bimonoid object $c \in C$, there is symmetric monoidal functor $F: FinRel \to C$, unique up to monoidal natural isomorphism, mapping $1 \in FinRel$ together with its bimonoid operations to $c$ and its bimonoid operations.

This is conveniently expressed in the language of [[PROP]]s: $Mat(Bool)$ is the PROP for special bicommutative bimonoids.   This is Theorem 7.2 in Coya and Fong, based on techniques from Lack's paper "Composing PROPs".
