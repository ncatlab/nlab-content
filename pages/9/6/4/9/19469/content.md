##Idea

For any [[2-category]] $K$, there are two 2-categories (each with several variants) that could be called "the 2-category of adjunctions in $K$".

* The 2-category which here we call $Adj(K)$ has the same objects as $K$, its morphisms are the [[adjunctions]] in $K$ (pointing in the direction of, say, the left adjoint), and its 2-cells are [[mate]]-pairs of 2-cells between adjunctions in $K$.

* The 2-category $[Adj,K]$ is the [[functor 2-category]] from the [[walking adjunction]] $Adj$ to $K$.  Thus its *objects* are the adjunctions in $K$ --- or more precisely, triples (x,y,(f,g,\eta,\epsilon))$ where $x,y$ are objects of $K$ and $(f,g,\eta,\epsilon)$ is an adjunction between $x$ and $y$.  Its morphisms are pairs of morphisms $x\to x'$ and $y\to y'$ such that certain squares commute (perhaps up to a transformation or isomorphism), and its 2-cells are similarly composed of cylinders.

Note that the *morphisms* of $Adj(K)$ are the *objects* of $[Adj,K]$.

## Properties

* The morphisms in $Adj(Adj(K))$ are the [[adjoint triples]] in $K$.

* The inclusion of $Mnd$, the free monad, in $Adj$ induces a 2-functor from $[Adj,K]$ to the 2-category $[Mnd,K]$ of monads in $K$. The adjoints to this 2-functor are the [[Kleisli category|Kleisli]] and [[Eilenberg-Moore category|Eilenberg-Moore]] constructions on monads in $K$.
