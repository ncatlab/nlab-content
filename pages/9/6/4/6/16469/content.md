## Idea

A _supermultiplet_ is an [[irreducible representation]] of a [[supersymmetry]] [[supergroup]] or [[super Lie algebra]].

For the case of [[unitary representations of the super Poincaré group]], then under the canonical inclusion of the ordinary [[Poincaré group]] into the [[super Poincaré group]], the supermultiplets for super-isometries of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] decompose into a [[direct sum]] of irreducible [[unitary representations of the Poincaré group]]. Via the [[Wigner classification]] of fundamental [[particles]] as irreps of the [[Poincaré group]], this gives a decomposition of supermultiplets into [[particle]] species. The particles in this direct sum related by odd supersymmetry transformations are called _superpartners_.

Similar statements hold for the [[super anti de Sitter group]] or [[superconformal group]] etc.

By [[Deligne's theorem on tensor categories]] the most general regular [[tensor categories]] are those spanned by supermultiplets for some [[supergroup]].
