## Definition

A [[sheaf topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ is called **strongly connected** if it is a [[locally connected topos]]

$$
  (\Pi_0 \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : \mathcal{E} \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_0}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}} Set
$$

such that the extra [[left adjoint]] $\Pi_0$ in addition preserves finite [[product]]s (the [[terminal object]] and binary products).

This means it is in particular also a [[connected topos]].

If $\Pi_0$ preserves even all [[finite limit]]s then $\mathcal{E}$ is called a [[totally connected topos]].

If a strongly connected topos is also a [[local topos]], then it is a [[cohesive topos]].
