## Definition


A [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is __abelian__ if its bracket is identically 0, in that for all $x,y \in \mathfrak{g}$ we have 

$$ 
  [x,y] = 0
  \,.
$$

## Examples

Every [[vector space]] has a (necessarily unique) abelian Lie algebra structure.  As such, we may identify an abelian Lie algebra with its underlying vector space.

A $0$-dimensional or $1$-dimensional Lie algebra must be abelian.  The $0$-dimensional Lie algebra is the [[trivial Lie algebra]].  The $1$-dimensional Lie algebra is a [[simple object]] in [[LieAlg]], but it is traditionally *not* considered a [[simple Lie algebra]].

## Lie integration

Under [[Lie integration]] abelian Lie algebras integrate to [[abelian Lie group]]s.
