A [[Lie algebra]] is __abelian__ if it satisfies the identity
$$ [x,x] = 0 .$$

Every [[vector space]] has a (necessarily unique) abelian Lie algebra structure.  As such, we may identify an abelian Lie algebra with its underlying vector space.

A $0$-dimensional or $1$-dimensional Lie algebra must be abelian.  The $0$-dimensional Lie algebra is the [[trivial Lie algebra]].  The $1$-dimensional Lie algebra is a [[simple object]] in [[Lie Alg]], but it is traditionally *not* considered a [[simple Lie algebra]].
