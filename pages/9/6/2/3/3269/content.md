## Idea

The _Chow group_ of a [[scheme]] $X$ is the analog of the [[singular chain homology]] group of a [[topological space]].
 

## Definition

There is a notion of [[algebraic cycle]] $\in Z_i(X)$ generalizing that of a singular cycle. One first introduces some [[adequate equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on the set of cycles. The main example is the rational equivalence of cycles. 

The **$i$th Chow group** $CH_i(X) := Z_i(X)_\sim$ of $X$ is the group of equivalence classes of algebraic cycles in $X$. 

The total **Chow group** is the [[direct sum]] of all these

$$
  CH(X) := \oplus_i Z_i(X)_\sim
  \,.
$$



## Cohomological interpretation

Chow groups appear as the [[cohomology group]]s of [[motivic cohomology]] (see there for details) with coefficients in suitable [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]]s.
