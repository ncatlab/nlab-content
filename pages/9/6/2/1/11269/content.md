## Idea

Diagonal arguments are arguments that place limitations on the extent that a set $T$ can "talk about" attributes of elements of $T$. They are related to the paradoxes of old (e.g., the [[liar paradox]], [[Russell's paradox]]) that typically involve some degree of self-reference. 

Traditional "diagonal arguments" enter the proofs of, for example, 

* [[Cantor's theorem]]

* [[GÃ¶del]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]]

* [[halting theorem]]

As explained by [Yanofsky](#Yan) (after Lawvere), each of these diagonal arguments can be viewed as instances of the

* [[Lawvere fixed point theorem]]

which places limitations on how a set $T$ can self-describe $Y$-valued attributes of $T$ (a set $Y^T$) via a function $T \to Y^T$, or via a function $T \times T \to Y$. The name comes from a construction that involves the [[diagonal map]] $T \to T \times T$.
