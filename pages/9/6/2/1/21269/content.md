## Idea

An *ordinary tangle* is a [[dimension of a manifold|1-dimensional]] [[manifold]] [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]] that is [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embedded]] into the 3-cube, such that the [[boundary]] is embedded into chosen chosen pair opposing sides of the cube. 

Thus, one may think of a tangle as (a [[knot]] if it is [[connected topological space|connected]] or generally as) a [[link]] that was cut at several points and the resulting strands pulled apart at their endpoints to opposite sides of the cube. Conversely, a [[link]] ([[knot]]) is equivalently a (connected) tangle with [[empty set|empty]] [[boundary]].

Similarly, a tangle that progresses [[monotonic function|monotonically]] from its source to its target is equivalently a *[[braid group|braid]]*.

The notion of tangles generalizes to that of *$m$-tangles in dimension $n$*, which are $m$-[[manifolds with corners]] embedded into the $n$-cube such that their corners are appropriately embedded in the cube's boundary. In this sense ordinary tangles are the 1-tangles in 3-space.


## Properties

### Category of tangles

Tangles naturally constitute the [[morphisms]] of a [[category]]: 

The [[objects]] are [[finite set|finite]] [[subsets]] of $\mathbf{R}^2$. Morphisms $A\to B$ are embeddings of unions of finitely many closed intervals and circles into $[0,1]\times\mathbf{R}^2$ such that the restriction of the embedding to the endpoints yields a bijection to $A\sqcup B$. Morphisms are composed by gluing two copies of $[0,1]$ together and rescaling.

As usual, this suffers from being [[associativity|associative]] only up to an ambient [[isotopy]]. Thus, one can either take ambient isotopy classes of such embeddings, obtaining a [[1-category]] of tangles, or instead turn tangles into an [[(âˆž,1)-category]],
in which case morphisms $A\to B$ will encode the whole [[homotopy type]] of the space of embeddings described above.


### Category of framed tangles

Analogously there is a notion of *framed* tangles which are to ordinary tangles as [[framed links]] are to ordinary [[links]].

\begin{proposition}\label{ShumTheorem}
**([[Shum's theorem]])**
\linebreak
  The [[category of framed oriented tangles]] is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the [[free construction|free]] [[ribbon category]] generated by a single [[object]].
\end{proposition}
([Shum 1994](#Shum94), [Yetter 2001 Thm. 9.1](#Yetter01))

## Higher-dimensional variants

Higher-dimensional tangles, i.e. $m$-manifolds with corners embedded in the $n$-cube, were considered for instance in [Baez and Dolan 95](#BaezDolan95). A "tame" definition of tangles that admit *finite* [[stratified space|stratifications]] by their critical point types was given in [Dorn and Douglas 22](#DornDouglas22).
