On this page we construct the category of Nisnevich sheaves with transfer over a base scheme $S$ which is assumed to be [[regular scheme|regular]] and [[noetherian scheme|noetherian]], following [D&#233;glise](#Deglise).  Nisnevich sheaves with transfer play an important role in the theory of [[mixed motives]].

## Definitions

1.  Let $S$ be a base [[scheme]] which is [[regular scheme|regular]] and [[noetherian scheme|noetherian]].

2.  Let $Sm_S$ denote the category of [[schemes]] that are [[smooth]] and of [[finite type]] over $S$.  For $X,Y \in \Sm_S$, one defines the group of **finite $S$-[[correspondences]]** $C_S(X, Y)$ as the [[free abelian group]] generated by closed integral subschemes $Z \subset X \times_S Y$ such that the projection $Z \to X$ is [[finite]] and [[equidimensional morphism|equidimensional]].  This defines an [[additive category]] $Sm_S^{cor}$ whose objects are the same as $Sm_S$ and whose morphisms are finite $S$-correspondences.

3.  Note that there is a canonical functor $\gamma_S : \Sm_S \to \Sm_S^cor$ which acts on a [[morphism]] by taking the finite correspondence induced by its [[graph]].

4.  Recall that the [[fibred product]] over $S$ defines a [[symmetric monoidal structure]] on $\Sm_S$.  One can check that this also induces a [[symmetric monoidal structure]] on $\Sm_S^{cor}$.  The functor $\gamma_S$ respects these structures.

5.  Let $P_S$ (resp. $P_S^{tr}$) denote the category of [[abelian presheaves]] on $\Sm_S$ (resp. on $\Sm_S^{cor}$).  Objects of $P_S^{tr}$ are called **presheaves with transfer** on $S$.  We will write $L_S[X]$ for the [[presheaf]] with transfers [[representable|represented]] by an object $X \in \Sm_S$.

6.  Let $N_S$ denote the category of [[sheaves]] on $\Sm_S$ with respect to the [[Nisnevich topology]].  Let $N_S^{tr} \subset P_S^{tr}$ be the [[full subcategory]] spanned by [[presheaves]] $F : \Sm_S^{cor} \to Ab$ whose [[composition]] with $\gamma_S : \Sm_S \to \Sm_S^{cor}$ is a [[sheaf]] on $Sm_S$ (with respect to the [[Nisnevich topology]]).  Objects of $N_S^{tr}$ are called **Nisnevich sheaves with transfer**.

7.  **Proposition.** The category $N_S^{tr}$ is [[cocomplete]] and [[Grothendieck abelian category|Grothendieck abelian]] with an [[essentially small]] set of [[generators]] given by the objects $L_S[X]$ for $X \in \Sm_S$.

8.  This allows one to define a [[symmetric monoidal structure]] on $N_S^{tr}$, which is in fact the unique one for which the functor $\Sm_S \to \N_S^{tr}$ is [[symmetric monoidal]] and $- \otimes_S^{tr} -$ preserves [[colimits]].  Given $F$ and $G$ in $N_S^{tr}$, we can write
  $$ F = \colim_{X \to F} L_S[X] ; \qquad G = \colim_{Y \to G} L_S[Y] $$
where the [[colimits]] are taken over the family of morphisms $L_S[X] \to F$ (resp. $L_S[Y] \to G$.  Then we define
  $$ F \otimes_S^{tr} G = \colim_{X \to F ; Y \to G} L_S[X \times_S Y]. $$

9.  This [[symmetric monoidal structure]] is further [[closed monoidal structure|closed]]: one defines
  $$ \underline{\Hom}_{N_S^{tr}} (F,G) (X) = \Hom_{N_S^{tr}} (F \otimes_S^{tr} L_S[X], G) $$
for all $X \in \Sm_S$.
