
Bill Thurston was an American mathematician (Fields Medalist, 1982) who made important contributions to the theory of [[orbifolds]], the theory of [[foliation|foliations]], [[low-dimensional topology]] (especially in three dimensions), and to [[geometric group theory]].  He is perhaps best known for his [[geometrization conjecture]] (which was proved by Thurston in special cases, and by [[Richard Hamilton]] and [[Grigori Perelman]] in complete generality, and which in turn implies the [[Poincaré conjecture]]).
