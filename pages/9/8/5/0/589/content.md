A [[category]] $D$ is **complete** if it has all small [[limit|limits]]: that is, if every diagram 

$$ F: D \to C$$

where $D$ is a [[small category]] has a limit in $C$.

Many familiar categories of mathematical structures are complete: to name just a few examples, [[Set]], [[Grp]], [[Ab]], [[Vect]] and [[Top]] are complete.
