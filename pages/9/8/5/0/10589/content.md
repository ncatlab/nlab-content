## Idea

The _Weil conjectures_ are a sequence of [[conjectures]] about the properties of the number of points of [[algebraic varieties]] $X$ over [[finite fields]] $\mathbb{F}_p$, hence the number of [[homomorphisms]]

$$
  Spec \mathbb{F}_p \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

Effectively the conjecture says that the [[generating function]] for the number of points -- the [[zeta function]] -- for all $p$ is a [[rational function]] with some nice properties.

It was realized that the all except one of the conjectures (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]) would follow formally from the existence of a suitable [[cohomology theory]] on [[algebraic varieties]] which behaves in essential aspects like [[ordinary cohomology]] of [[topological spaces]] and which in particular satisfies a [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]], a [[Weil cohomology theory]].

Later [[Alexander Grothendieck]] found that the relevant [[cohomology]] theory is [[étale cohomology]] of [[schemes]].
