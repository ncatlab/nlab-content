## Idea

The _Weil conjectures_ are a sequence of [[conjectures]] about counting the number of points of [[algebraic varieties]] $X$ over [[finite fields]]; $\mathbb{F}_p$ and extensions thereof. That is, the number of [[homomorphisms]]

$$
  \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{F}_{p^n} \longrightarrow X
  \,
$$
for fixed $p$ but all $n \geq 1$.

Effectively the conjecture says that the [[generating function]] for the number of points as $n$ varies -- the [[zeta function]] -- is a [[rational function]] with some nice properties.

It was realized that the all except one of the conjectures (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]) would follow formally from the existence of a suitable [[cohomology theory]] on [[algebraic varieties]] which behaves in essential aspects like [[ordinary cohomology]] of [[topological spaces]] and which in particular satisfies a [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]] - what is now called a [[Weil cohomology theory]].

Later [[Alexander Grothendieck]] found that the relevant [[cohomology]] theory is [[étale cohomology]] of [[schemes]].
