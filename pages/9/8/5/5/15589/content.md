## Idea

In the spirit of the [[function field analogy]], _geometric class field theory_ is analogous to [[class field theory]], but where the latter studies finite abelian extensions of [[global fields]], geometric class field theory studies finite [[covering spaces]] of suitable [[algebraic curves]] over any constant [[perfect field]] $k$, not necessarily a [[finite field]] and possibly of [[characteristic zero]]. In particular $k$ may be the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, in which case the theory is about covering of [[complex|curves]].

As such, geometric class field theory has become part of the [[geometric Langlands program]] and of higher dimensional class field theory.
