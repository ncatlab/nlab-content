## Idea 

A *von Neumann regular ring* is one where all [[ideal|principal left ideals]] and principal right ideals are generated by [[idempotents]].  They were introduced by [[John von Neumann]] in 1936 as part of his algebraization of [[quantum mechanics]].

The principal left ideals in a von Neumann regular ring form a sublattice of the [[lattice]] of all left ideals which is a [[complemented lattice|complemented]] [[modular lattice]], and similarly with "left" replaced by "right".  This sets up a connection between von Neumann regular rings and the approach to [[quantum logic]] based on lattices: if the elements of a von Neumann regular ring are thought of as [[observables]], the lattice of principal left (or right) ideals can be thought of as consisting of [[propositions]].

## Definition

A *von Neumann regular ring* is a [[ring]] $A$ (not necessarily [[commutative ring|commutative]]) such that any of these equivalent conditions hold:

1. For every [[element]] $a \in A$ there exists $x \in A$ satisfying
$$
  a
  \;=\;
  a \, x \, a
  \,.
$$
2. For every $a \in A$ there is an [[idempotent]] $e \in A$ such that $A a = A e$.  In other words, every [[principal ideal|principal]]  [[left ideal]] of $A$ is generated by an idempotent.

3. For every $a \in A$ there is an [[idempotent]] $e \in A$ such that $a A = e A$.  In other words, every principal [[right ideal]] of $A$ is generated by an idempotent.

4. Every principal left ideal of $A$ is a [[direct sum|direct summand]] of the left $A$-[[module]] $A$.

5. Every  principal right ideal of $A$ is a direct summand of the right $A$-module $A$.

6.  Every finitely generated left $A$-module is [[projective module|projective]].

7.  Every finitely generated right $A$-module is [[projective module|projective]].

8. Every left $A$-module is [[flat module|flat]].

9.  Every right $A$-module is [[flat module|flat]].


To illustrate the use of the rather curious-looking equation $a = a x a$, consider this result, which implies that 1 $\iff$ 3.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose $a \in A$.  If for some $x \in A$ we have $a = a x a$, then $e = a x$ is idempotent and $a A = e A$. Conversely, if $a A = e A$ for some idempotent $e \in A$, then $a = a x a$ for some $x \in A$, and we can take $e = a x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} For the first implication, suppose for some $x \in A$ we have $a = a x a$.   Then $a x = a x a x$ so $e = a x$ is idempotent, and we just need to show $a A = e A$.   Since $e = a x$ we have $e A \subseteq a A$.   On the other hand, since $ a = a x a = e a$ we have $a A \subseteq e A$.

For the converse implication, suppose $a A = e A$ for some idempotent $e$.  This is equivalent to the conjunction of three conditions: $e \in a A$, $a \in e A$, and $e^2 = e$.      The first condition says $e = a x$ for some $x \in A$.  The second condition says $a = e y$ for some $y \in A$, which by the third condition implies $e a = e e y = e y = a$, which by the first implies $a x a = a$, as desired.
\end{proof}

A symmetrical argument, i.e. one applied to the [[opposite ring]], shows that 1 $\iff$ 3.  A principal left ideal is a summand of the left $A$-module $A$ if it is generated by an idempotent $e$, since then $A = Ae \oplus A(1-e)$, and conversely any summand of the left $A$-module $A$ is generated by an idempotent.  It follows that 2 $\iff$ 4, and a symmetrical argument shows that 3 $\iff$ 5. Finally, condition 1 is invariant under taking opposites of rings, and 2 is the ring opposite of 3, so also 1 $\iff$ 2, and therefore conditions 1 through 5 are equivalent. 

Again, by way of taking opposite rings, we have (1 $\iff$ 6) if and only if we have (1 $\iff$ 7) and similarly (1 $\iff$ 8) iff (1 $\iff$ 9). 

\subsection{Commutative von Neumann rings}

One can characterize [[commutative ring|commutative]] von Neumann rings as certain subrings of fields. 

The first remark to make is that such rings $R$ form a variety of algebras, in other words they are the algebras of a [[finitary monad]] on the category [[Set]], equivalently, [[models]] of a [[Lawvere theory]]. This is due to the following lemma. Define a *pseudo-inverse* of an element $a \in R$ to be an element $x \in R$ such that $a x a = a$ and $x a x = x$. (Compare [[pseudogroup]], and see also [[inverse semigroup]].) 

\begin{lemma} In a commutative von Neumann ring, every element $a$ has a unique pseudo-inverse $x$. \end{lemma} 

\begin{proof} Given $a$, there is $x$ such that $a x a = a$. It is an immediate calculation that $y = x a x$ is a pseudo-inverse of $a$. 

To prove uniquness, suppose $x, y$ are both pseudo-inverses of $a$, i.e., we have the four equations 

$$a x a = a \qquad x a x = x \qquad a y a = a \qquad y a y = y.$$

We want to prove $x = y$. First prove $a x = a y$: 

$$a x = x a = x a y a = (x a y)a = a(x a y) = (a x a)y = a y.$$ 

Then prove $x = y$: 

$$x = x(a x) = x(a y) = y(a x) = y(a y) = y.$$ 
This completes the proof. 
\end{proof} 

It follows immediately from this lemma that commutative von Neumann rings are the same thing as commutative rings equipped with a pseudo-inversion operator $a \mapsto \overline{a}$ (moreover, pseudo-inversion is uniquely determined, as we just saw). Now we can state the characterization: 

\begin{theorem} Every commutative von Neumann ring $R$ occurs as a subring of a product of fields that is closed under pseudo-inversion. \end{theorem} 

We sketch the proof as the end result after a series of lemmas. 

\begin{lemma} There are no non-zero [[nilpotent element|nilpotents]] in a von Neumann regular ring. \end{lemma} 

\begin{proof} It is enough to show that $a^2 = 0$ implies $a = 0$. But $a = a \overline{a} a = a^2 \overline{a}$ makes this plain. \end{proof} 

\begin{lemma} An [[integral domain]] that is von Neumann regular ring must be a [[field]]. \end{lemma} 

\begin{proof} It is easy to see from $(1 - a\overline{a})a = a - a\overline{a}a = 0$ that either $a = 0$ or $a$ is invertible. \end{proof} 

\begin{corollary} Every prime ideal in a commutative von Neumann regular ring is maximal. \end{corollary} 

\begin{corollary} For a commutative von Neumann regular ring, the [[nilradical]] equals the [[Jacobson radical]] (the intersection of all maximal ideals). 
\end{corollary} 

\begin{proof} This follows from a well-known consequence of the [[axiom of choice]], or of the even weaker [[ultrafilter principle]], that the nilradical equals the intersection of all prime ideals. The statement then follows from the previous corollary. \end{proof} 

The lemmas and corollaries enter the proof of the Theorem:

\begin{proof}: Taking $\mathfrak{m}$ to range over maximal ideals of $R$, the canonical quotient maps $R \to R/\mathfrak{m}$ are maps to fields, and these quotient maps \lq\lq tuple" together to form a map into a product of fields 

$$\phi: R \to \prod_{\mathfrak{m}} R/\mathfrak{m}.$$ 

The image is obviously closed under pseudo-inversion. The map $\phi$ maps $R$ isomorphically onto its image iff it has trivial kernel, but the kernel is clearly just the intersection of all maximal ideals, which is the same as the nilradical, which is the ideal consisting precisely of nilpotent elements, but the only nilpotent is the zero element. Thus the kernel is trivial, and the proof is complete. \end{proof} 



## Examples

* Every [[field]] is a von Neumann regular ring. 

* Every [[semisimple ring]] is von Neumann regular.

* For $V$ a [[vector space]] over a [[skew-field]] $K$, its [[endomorphism ring]] $End_K(V)$ is von Neumann regular.

* The property of being a von Neumann regular ring is [[invariant]] under [[Morita equivalence]], so if $A$ is a von Neumann regular ring so is the $n \times n$ [[matrix algebra]] $M_n(A)$.
