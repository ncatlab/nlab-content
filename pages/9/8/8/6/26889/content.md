## Idea 

A *von Neumann regular ring* is one where all [[ideal|principal left ideals]] and principal right ideals are generated by [[idempotents]].  They were introduced by [[John von Neumann]] in 1936 as part of his algebraization of [[quantum mechanics]].

The principal left ideals in a von Neumann regular ring form a sublattice of the [[lattice]] of all left ideals which is a [[complemented lattice|complemented]] [[modular lattice]], and similarly with "left" replaced by "right".  This sets up a connection between von Neumann regular rings and the approach to [[quantum logic]] based on lattices: if the elements of a von Neumann regular ring are thought of as [[observables]], the lattice of principal left (or right) ideals can be thought of as consisting of [[propositions]].

## Definition

A *von Neumann regular ring* is a [[ring]] $A$ (not necessarily [[commutative ring|commutative]]) such that any of these equivalent conditions hold:

1. For every [[element]] $a \in A$ there exists $x \in A$ satisfying
$$
  a
  \;=\;
  a \, x \, a
  \,.
$$
2. For every $a \in A$ there is an [[idempotent]] $e \in A$ such that $A a = A e$.  In other words, every [[principal ideal|principal]]  [[left ideal]] of $A$ is generated by an idempotent.

3. For every $a \in A$ there is an [[idempotent]] $e \in A$ such that $a A = e A$.  In other words, every principal [[right ideal]] of $A$ is generated by an idempotent.

4. Every principal left ideal of $A$ is a [[direct sum|direct summand]] of the left $A$-[[module]] $A$.

5. Every  principal right ideal of $A$ is a direct summand of the right $A$-module $A$.

6. Every left $A$-module is [[flat module|flat]].

7.  Every right $A$-module is [[flat module|flat]].

8.  Every finitely generated left $A$-module is [[projective module|projective]].

9.  Every finitely generated right $A$-module is [[projective module|projective]].

To illustrate the use of the rather curious-looking equation $a = a x a$, consider this result, which implies that 1 $\iff$ 3.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose $a \in A$.  If for some $x \in A$ we have $a = a x a$, then $e = a x$ is idempotent and $a A = e A$. Conversely, if $a A = e A$ for some idempotent $e \in A$, then $a = a x a$ for some $x \in A$, and we can take $e = a x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} For the first implication, suppose for some $x \in A$ we have $a = a x a$.   Then $a x = a x a x$ so $e = a x$ is idempotent, and we just need to show $a A = e A$.   Since $e = a x$ we have $e A \subseteq a A$.   On the other hand, since $ a = a x a = e a$ we have $a A \subseteq e A$.

For the converse implication, suppose $a A = e A$ for some idempotent $e$.  This is equivalent to the conjunction of three conditions: $e \in a A$, $a \in e A$, and $e^2 = e$.      The first condition says $e = a x$ for some $x \in A$.  The second condition says $a = e y$ for some $y \in A$, which by the third condition implies $e a = e e y = e y = a$, which by the first implies $a x a = a$, as desired.
\end{proof}

A symmetrical argument, i.e. one applied to the [[opposite ring]], shows that 1 $\iff$ 3.  A principal left ideal is a summand of the left $A$-module $A$ if it is generated by an idempotent $e$, since then $A = Ae \oplus A(1-e)$, and conversely any summand of the left $A$-module $A$ is generated by an idempotent.  It follows that 2 $\iff$ 4, and a symmetrical argument shows that 3 $\iff$ 5.

## Examples

* Every [[field]] is a von Neumann regular ring. 

* Every [[semisimple ring]] is von Neumann regular.

* For $V$ a [[vector space]] over a [[skew-field]] $K$, its [[endomorphism ring]] $End_K(V)$ is von Neumann regular.

* The property of being a von Neumann regular ring is [[invariant]] under [[Morita equivalence]], so if $A$ is a von Neumann regular ring so is the $n \times n$ [[matrix algebra]] $M_n(A)$.
