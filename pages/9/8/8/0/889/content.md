A __setoid__ is a [[set]] $S$ equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$.

Equivalently, a setoid is a [[groupoid]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[truth value]]s.  However, up to [[equivalence of categories]], such a groupoid is always a [[set]], the [[quotient set]] $S/{\equiv}$.

Setoids are particularly important in [[foundations]] of mathematics where quotient sets don\'t always exist and the above equivalence cannot be carried out.  However, arguably this is a terminological mismatch, and such people should say 'set' where they say 'setoid' and something else (such as 'preset', 'type', or 'completely presented set') where they say 'set'.
