## Idea ##

The _motivic [[cohomology]]_ of a [[scheme]] $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on the Zariski or [[etale cohomology|etale]] [[site]] of $X$ (an analog of the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]]) with coefficients in a complex of sheaves $A$ called the **motivic complex**.

## Definition ##

The **motivic complex** -- a [[chain complex]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in abelian groups -- is defined in [definition 3.1, page 33](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=33) of 

* Carlo Mazza, Vladimir Voevodsky and Charles Weibel, _Lectures in motivic cohomology_ ([web](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html) [pdf](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf))


The definition of motivic cohomology on a [[scheme]] $X$ as the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to the Zariski site structure on $X$ and with coefficients in the motivic complex is [definition 3,4, page 22](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=34).

The analogous definition with the Zariski [[site]] structure of $X$ replaced by the [[etale cohomology|etale site]] $Et(X)$ is in [lecture 10](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=87).

## As hom-sets of motives ##

Motivic cohomology computes certain derived hom-sets in the [[motive|category of motives]].

This is discussed in [lecture 14](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=121) of [MaVoWe](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html). See [prop 14.16](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=126).
