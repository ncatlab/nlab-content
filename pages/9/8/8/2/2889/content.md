## Idea ##

Motivic cohomology was for a long time a hypothetical [[cohomology]] theory on [[scheme]]s whose hypothetical existence [[Alexander Grothendieck]] proposed in the 1960s should be the underlying reason for what are called the [[standard conjectures on algebraic cycles]].

In the mid 1990s [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] proposed a concrete definition of motivic cohomology of a [[scheme]] $X$ as the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on the Zariski or [[etale cohomology|etale]] [[site]] of $X$ (an analog of the [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]]) with coefficients in a complex of sheaves $A$ called the **motivic complex**.

He also gave a concrete definition of the hypothetized [[category of motives]], whose objects are [[scheme]]s but whose morphisms are certain [[correspondence]]s, and showed that motivic cohomology is realized as derived hom-complexes in this category of motives.

Voevodsky's proposal could be shown to have all of the properties that Grothendieck had demanded on the hypothetical cohomology theory, except that to date it hasn't been shown yet that the cohomology groups vanish in negative degree, as they should.

## Voevodsky's definition ##


The **motivic complex** -- a [[chain complex]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in abelian groups -- is defined in [definition 3.1, page 33](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=33) of 

* Carlo Mazza, Vladimir Voevodsky and Charles Weibel, _Lectures in motivic cohomology_ ([web](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html) [pdf](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf))


The definition of motivic cohomology on a [[scheme]] $X$ as the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to the Zariski site structure on $X$ and with coefficients in the motivic complex is [definition 3,4, page 22](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=34).

The analogous definition with the Zariski [[site]] structure of $X$ replaced by the [[etale cohomology|etale site]] $Et(X)$ is in [lecture 10](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=87).

### As hom-sets of motives ###

Motivic cohomology computes certain derived hom-sets in the [[motive|category of motives]].

This is discussed in [lecture 14](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=121) of [MaVoWe](http://math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/motiviclectures.html). See [prop 14.16](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MVWnotes/prova-hyperlink.pdf#page=126).
