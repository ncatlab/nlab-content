## Idea

Certain [[Grothendieck topologies]] on a category with an [[initial object]] can be presented by a very simple structure called a _cd-structure_.

## Definition

A *cd-structure* on an [[infinity-category]] $C$ with an [[initial object]] is a class of commutative squares which is stable by isomorphism.  It is called **complete** if every [[morphism]] whose target is an [[initial object]] of $C$ is an isomorphism, and if it is stable by [[base change]] along arbitrary morphisms of $C$.

Any cd-structure gives rise in a canonical way to a [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$.

There are various interesting cd-structures on the category of [[schemes]] over a base $S$, which give rise to [[Grothendieck topologies]] like the [[Zariski topology|Zariski]], [[Nisnevich topology|Nisnevich]] and [[cdh topology|cdh]] topologies.
