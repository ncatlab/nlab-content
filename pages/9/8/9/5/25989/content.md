
If $V$ is a vector space, then the symmetric algebra $Sym(V^*)$ can be interpreted as the algebra of regular functions on $V$ considered as an (affine) space. One can generalize this construction to sheaves over a base scheme obtaining a sheaf of algebras. 

Let $S$ be an [[algebraic scheme]] and $\mathcal{F}$ a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] of $\mathcal{O}_S$-modules. For any affine $U\subset S$, the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of $Sym_{\mathcal{O}(U)}(\mathcal{F}(U))$ is a $U$-scheme; by gluing these spectra over all affines, one obtains an $S$-scheme
$Spec(Sym_{\mathcal{O}_S}\mathcal{F})$, the __relative spectrum__ of $\mathcal{F}$ over $S$ (also called the global spectrum of $\mathcal{F}$).

An $S$-scheme which can be obtained as a relative spectrum over $S$ is said to be a __relative affine scheme__.
