
Myles Tierney was a Rutgers faculty member for thirty-four years, coming to Rutgers as an Associate Professor in 1968 following positions at Rice University (1965-6) and at the ETH-Forschungsinstitut f&#252;r Mathematik, Z&#252;rich (1966-68). He received his B.A. from Brown University in 1959 and his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1965. 

Myles began his career as an [[algebraic topology|algebraic topologist]], moved toward [[category theory]] and was responsible (together with [[Bill Lawvere|F.W. Lawvere]]) for the introduction of a new field within category theory: [[elementary topoi]]. 

He had six Ph.D. students: Ira Wolf (1971), Carol Ann Keller (1983), Norman Adams (1984), Terence Lindgren (1984), [[Todd Trimble]] (1994), and Luca Mauri (1998). Myles retired as of January 1, 2003 and was honored by the Department at a retirement party on December 10, 2002.
