## Idea ##

A generalisation of various kinds of [[spaces]] equipped with a relation between its elements and its sequences. 

WARNING: “Generalised sequential space” is a placeholder name for a concept which may or may not have another name in the mathematics literature. 

## Definition ##

A set $S$ is a **generalised sequential space** if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the set of all [[sequences]] in $S$ and $S$ itself, for $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and $c \in S$. A generalised sequential space is **[[sequentially Hausdorff]]** if the binary relation is a [[functional relation]], and every sequentially Hausdorff generalised sequential space has a [[partial function]] 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} (-)_n:S^\mathbb{N} \to S$$ 

The morphisms between generalised sequential space are the **sequential limit-preserving functions**: a function $f$ between generalised sequential spaces $S$ and $T$ is __sequential limit-preserving__ if for all sequences $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to c$ implies that $(f \circ x) \to f(c)$, where $f \circ x \in T^\mathbb{N}$ is the [[sequence]] generated by [[composition|precomposition]] of the sequence $x$ by the function $f$. The [[isomorphisms]] between generalised sequential space $S$ and $T$ are the [[bijections]] $f$ from $S$ to $T$ such that for all sequences $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to c$ [[if and only if]] $(f \circ x) \to f(c)$. 

## Generalised net spaces

The above concept can also be generalised from sequences to [[nets]]. 

WARNING: “Generalised net space” is a placeholder name for a concept which may or may not have another name in the mathematics literature. 

A set $S$ is a **generalised net space** if for each [[directed set]] $I$, there is a [[binary relation]] $x \to_I c$ between the set of all $I$-indexed [[nets]] in $S$ and $S$ itself, for $x \in S^I$ and $c \in S$. A generalised net space is **[[Hausdorff]]** if each binary relation $x \to_I c$ is a [[functional relation]] for all directed sets $I$. 

The morphisms between preconvergence spaces are the **limit-preserving functions**: a function $f$ between generalised net spaces $S$ and $T$ is **limit-preserving** if for all [[directed sets]] $I$, [[nets]] $x \in S^I$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to_I c$ implies that $(f \circ x) \to_I f(c)$, where $f \circ x \in T^I$ is the [[net]] generated by [[composition|precomposition]] of the net $x$ by the function $f$. These functions can be called **netwise limit-preserving functions** to contrast with [[sequential limit-preserving functions]], which only preserve sequential limits in generalised net spaces. These functions can also be called **[[continuous functions]]** or **[[pointwise continuous functions]]**, since [[net#ContinuousFunctionsDetectedByNets|nets detect the continuity of functions between them]] in [[convergence spaces]] and [[topological spaces]]. 

The [[isomorphisms]] between generalised net spaces $S$ and $T$ are the [[bijections]] $f$ from $S$ to $T$ such that for all directed sets $I$ and nets $x \in S^I$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to_I c$ [[if and only if]] $(f \circ x) \to_I f(c)$.
