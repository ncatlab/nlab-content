## Idea ##

The most general space where the notion of convergence and limit for [[sequences]] makes sense, but the term "[[sequential convergence space]]" is already taken to mean a synonym of [[subsequential space]], and that definition is not the most general definition for which the notions of convergence and limit makes sense for sequences. 

## Definition ##

A set $S$ is a **sequential preconvergence space** if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the set of all [[sequences]] in $S$ and $S$ itself, for $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and $c \in S$. A sequential preconvergence space is **[[sequentially Hausdorff]]** if the binary relation is a [[functional relation]], and every sequentially Hausdorff sequential preconvergence space has a [[partial function]] 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} (-)_n:(\mathbb{N} \to S) \to S$$
