## Idea ##

By a *sequential preconvergence space* we shall mean the most general kind of [[topological space]] where the notion of [[convergence]] and [[limit of a sequence|limit]] for [[sequences]] makes sense. The possibly more evident term "[[sequential convergence space]]" for this notion is already taken to mean a synonym of *[[subsequential space]]*, but that definition is not the most general definition for which the notions of convergence and limit makes sense for sequences. 

## Definition ##

A set $S$ is a **sequential preconvergence space** if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the set of all [[sequences]] in $S$ and $S$ itself, for $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and $c \in S$. A sequential preconvergence space is **[[sequentially Hausdorff]]** if the binary relation is a [[functional relation]], and every sequentially Hausdorff sequential preconvergence space has a [[partial function]] 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} (-)_n:S^\mathbb{N} \to S$$ 

The morphisms between sequential preconvergence spaces are the **sequential limit-preserving functions**: a function $f$ between sequential preconvergence spaces $S$ and $T$ is __sequential limit-preserving__ if for all sequences $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to c$ implies that $(f \circ x) \to f(c)$, where $f \circ x \in T^\mathbb{N}$ is the [[sequence]] generated by [[composition|precomposition]] of the sequence $x$ by the function $f$. The [[isomorphisms]] between sequential preconverence spaces $S$ and $T$ are the [[bijections]] $f$ from $S$ to $T$ such that for all sequences $x \in S^\mathbb{N}$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to c$ [[if and only if]] $(f \circ x) \to f(c)$.
