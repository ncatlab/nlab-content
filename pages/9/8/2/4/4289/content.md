The __Croatian Black Hole School__ is a school inspired by the traditional Modave school in Belgium takes place on 21--25 June 2010 at [Trpanj](http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trpanj), on the Pelje&#353;ac Peninsula in southern Croatia. The organizer is [[Jarah Evslin]] and the main topic is the physics of [[black holes]], both theoretical and observational.

Lecture series:

* Chethan Krishnan (SISSA): Quantum field theory and black holes 

* Gaston Giribet (Buenos Aires):  Black hole physics and AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. (This includes Black hole physics in three-dimensional massive gravity, applications to four-dimensions (i.e. Kerr/CFT correspondence) and other topics (e.g. Lifshitz black holes).)

* John Wang (Niagara Univ and Buffalo)

* Dieter Van den Bleeken (Rutgers): BPS black holes and the attractor mechanism

* Mario Pasquato (Pisa): Intermediate mass black holes - observational challenges

* Malcolm Fairbairn (King's College):  Cosmology, astrophysics and astrophysical black goles 

* Holger Nielsen: Black hole information paradox
