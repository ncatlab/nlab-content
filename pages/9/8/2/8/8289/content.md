## Definition

By a *bifunctor* (short for _binary functor_, that is $2$-ary) or **functor of two variables** is simply a _[[functor]]_ whose [[domain]] is a [[product category]]:

For $C_1$, $C_2$ and $D$ [[categories]], a functor

$$
  F \;\colon\; C_1 \times C_2 \longrightarrow D
$$

is also called a _bifunctor_ from $C_1$ and $C_2$ to $D$.


\begin{remark}\label{Terminology}
**(terminology)**
\linebreak
While the term *[[bicategories]]* is used for ([[weak 2-category|weak]]) *[[2-categories]]*, the terminology "bifunctor" is not used in this context, instead one speaks of *[[pseudo-functors]]* or *[[2-functors]]* between [[bicategories]]/[[2-categories]].

In fact, even for the sense of a functor of 2 variable, the term "bifunctor" may not be used as frequently anymore as it used to, except maybe in parts of [[computer science]] and in [[model category]]-theory (cf. *[[Quillen bifunctor]]*).
\end{remark}

## Examples

Famous bifunctors are 

* the [[hom functor]]

  $$
    Hom(-,-) : C^{op} \times C \to Set
  $$

  on any [[locally small category]] $C$, or if $C$ is a [[closed category]], the [[internal hom]] functor

  $$
    [-,-] : C^{op} \times C \to C
    \,.
  $$

* on every [[monoidal category]] $(C, \otimes)$ the [[tensor product]] functor

  $$
    \otimes : C \times C \to C
  $$

A bifunctor of the form $D^{op} \times C \to Set$ is called a [[profunctor]].
