#Idea#

__Groupoidification__ is a program based on the observation that the operation of pull-pushing bundles of [[groupoid|groupoids]]

$$
  \array{
     \Psi
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
$$

through [[span|spans]] 

$$
  \array{
    && S
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    X &&&& Y
  }
$$

of [[groupoid|groupoids]] becomes a linear map acting on vector spaces after taking [[groupoid cardinality]] -- after "degroupoidification".

From another perspective, these over-groupoids are an [[example for geometric function objects]] as considered in the context of [[geometric function theory]].

#Remarks#

* Groupoidification is closely related to -- or maybe even synonymous to -- [[geometric function theory]].

#Relation to representation theory#

Groupoidification seems to be a central underlying governing principle in [[representation theory]] in its incarnation in  [[geometric function theory]].


#Relation to quantization#

Groupoidification in particular seems to illuminate structures encountered in the context of [[quantum field theory]]. Discussions of groupoidification in the context of QFT are
