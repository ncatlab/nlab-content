## Idea

The [[equation of motion]] as expressed in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].

Given a [[phase space]] represented by a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$, and given a [[Hamiltonian]] function $H \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ the solutions to the [[equations of motion]] are [[trajectories]] $\gamma \colon \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow X$ which satisfy

$$
  \mathbf{d} H(-) = \omega(\dot \gamma,-)
  \,,
$$

hence which are [[flow lines]] of the [[flow]] induced by the [[Hamiltonian vector field]] associated with $H$.
