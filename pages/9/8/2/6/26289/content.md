## Motivation

In [[category theory]], there is one sensible notion of [[limit]], which is defined in terms of [[universal property|universal]] [[cones]]. However, when we move to [[enriched category theory]], such limits (which we now call **conical limits** to distinguish them from more general notions of limits) are no longer sufficient. By "sufficient", we mean here that there are notions in enriched category theory that are limit-like (such as [[powers]]) but that are not examples of conical limits. Furthermore, it is not true that the [[presheaf category|copresheaf construction]] exhibits the free completion under conical limits. This motivates the move to [[weighted limits]], which are the appropriate notion of limit for enriched categories. In particular, the copresheaf construction is the free completion under weighted limits, and powers are examples of weighted limits.

For a general [[monoidal category]] $V$, weighted limits are more general than conical limits. However, when $V = Set$, every weighted limit can be expressed as a conical limit. This is useful, as the conical limits are simpler to describe than weighted limits.

A particular [[base of enrichment]] of interest is $Cat$, so that enriched categories are precisely [[2-categories]]. The appropriate notion of limit for 2-categories is a weighted 2-limit, i.e. the usual notion of weighted limit for enriched categories (see [[2-limit]] for more details). Unlike for $V = Set$, conical 2-limits do not suffice to capture all weighted 2-limits. Intuitively, cones only capture 1-cells, whereas it is also necessary to capture 2-cells for the appropriate notion of 2-limit.

However, it turns out that, just as every weighted limit for $V = Set$ can be reduced to a conical limit, every weighted limit for $V = Set$ can be reduced to a simpler kind of limit, called a **marked limit**. This is useful, as it makes working with 2-limits easier than working with general weighted limits.

## History and terminology

While the notion of marked 2-limit goes back a long way, for one reason or another they have remained overlooked until recently.

* Marked 2-limits were introduced by [[John Gray]] in [[Adjointness for 2-Categories]] as **cartesian quasi-limits**.
* [[Ross Street]] proved the equivalence between marked 2-limits and weighted 2-limits.
* Szyld studied such 2-limits, calling them **$\sigma$-s-limits**.
* The terminology **marked** appears in [Gagna–Harpaz–Lanari](#GHL22).
* A particular class of marked 2-limits, called **lax normal conical 2-limits**, (which suffices to capture all 2-limits) was studied by Mesiti.

## Definition

Let $F : A \to B$ be a [[2-functor]] between [[2-categories]], and let $A'$ be a locally full sub-2-category of $A$ (alternatively: a class of morphisms of $A$ closed under identities and composition). A **marked-lax limit** of $(A', F)$ is an object $m_l lim (A', F)$ together with a family of isomorphisms
$$B(b, m_l lim (A', F)) \cong [A, B]_{l, A'}(\Delta(b), F)$$
natural in $b \in B$, where $[A, B]_{l, A'}(\Delta(b), F)$ is the 2-category of [[2-functors]] $A \to B$, marked-lax natural transformations ([[lax natural transformations]] $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_f = 1$ if $f \in A'$), and [[modifications]].
