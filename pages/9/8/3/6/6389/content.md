I'm a theoretical physicist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My current research is in [quantum information theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07901), although my background before that was in [statistical physics, stochastic processes and evolutionary dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02958). I'm also [Blake Stacey](https://scirate.com/blake-stacey) at SciRate.
