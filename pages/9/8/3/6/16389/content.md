## Idea

What is called _light-cone gauge quantization_ is one approach to the [[quantization]] of [[sigma models]] whose [[target space]] has a [[lightlike]] [[Killing vector]]. The strategy of this approach is to [[gauge fixing|gauge fix]] the [[metric]] and [[diffeomorphisms]] of the [[worldvolume]] such that also the worldvolume has a [[lightlike]] [[Killing vector field]] and such that this is mapped to the given one on target space.

This typically fixes most of the available gauge freedom, and the strategy is then to apply [[quantization]] to what remains. For more on this general idea see at _[[quantization commutes with reduction]]_.

Often this is considered for [[target space]] being [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ and with $X^+ \coloneqq X^0 - X^1$ denoting one of its canonical lightlike [[coordinates]]. If $\tau$ denotes similarly a lightlike coordinate function on the [[worldvolume]], then the condition of light-cone gauge reads

$$
  X^+ = p^+ \tau
$$

for some proportionality constant $p^+$, the *light cone momentum*.  This is how light cone gauge appears in much of the physics literature.

If in addition, one assumes that the coordinate function $X^+$ on spacetime is periodic, hence that it actually runs along a [[circle]] [[fiber]] (which some authors take to be literally [[lightlike]], while others consider the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of [[boosts]] of a [[spacelike]] [[circle]] [[fiber]]), then the lightcone momentum $p^+$ becomes quantized in units of the inverse [[radius]] $R$ of this circle

\[
  \label{LightConeMomentumQuantization}
  p^+ \;=\; N/R
  \phantom{AAA}
  N \in \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
\]

The [[quantization]] of a [[sigma model]] in this situation is hence called the _discrete light cone quantization_ or _DLCQ_, for short.

Often it turns out that [[negative number|negative]] values of $N$ in (eq:LightConeMomentumQuantization) can be neglected or integrated out, so that 

$$
  N \in \mathbb{N}
$$

becomes a [[natural number]]-parameter akin to that considered in the [['t Hooft double line construction]] of [[gauge theories]], and then the [[large N limit]] of the discrete light cone quantization becomes of interest.


## Applications

### Quantization of Green-Schwarz super $p$-brane sigma models

Light cone gauge quantization is the only method by which [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma models]] have been quantized, to date. 

### BFSS matrix model

Specifically, applying light-cone gauge quantization to the [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] for the  [[M2-brane]] on 11d [[Minkowski spacetime]], combined with a certain regularization of the remaining l9ight-cone [[Hamiltonian]] yields the [[BFSS matrix model]].

### BMN matrix model 

Alternatively, applying the light cone gauge quantization of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] of the [[M2-brane]] not on [[Minkowski spacetime]] but, more generally, on 11d [[pp-wave spacetimes]] (which are [[Penrose limits]] of the [[near horizon geometry]] of the [[black brane|black]] [[M2-branes]]/[[M5-branes]]) yields the [[BMN matrix model]].
