#Definition#

An **associative ring spectrum**, or [[A-infinity ring]], is an [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|monoid object in]] the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] with its [[smash product of spectra]] [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal structure]].

Equivalently, this should be the same as an ordinary [[monoid]] with respect to the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].

#Remarks#

* A commutative associative ring spectrum is a [[commutative ring spectrum]], or [[E-infinity ring]].

the $(\infty,1)$-categorical description of associative ring spectra is in section 4.3 of
