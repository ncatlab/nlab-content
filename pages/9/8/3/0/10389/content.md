## Idea

In [[linear algebra]], by *linear subspaces* are typically meant the [[subobjects]] of [[vector spaces]], hence the *sub-vector-spaces*:

For $k$ a [[ground field]] and $V \in k Vec$ a $k$-[[vector space]], then a linear subspace of $V$ is another $k$-vector space $W$ equipped with a [[monomorphism]] $i \colon W \hookrightarrow V$, hence with a [[linear map]] $i$ whose [[underlying]] [[map]] is [[injective map|injective]].

Equivalently this means that the [[underlying set]] of $W$ is a [[subset]] of the underlying set of $V$ which is closed under the vector space operations in $V$.

If $V$ is equipped with the [[structure]] of a [[topological vector space]] then one is often interested in the [[closed subspace|closed]] linear subspaces.

More generally, for $R$ any [[ground ring]] one may regard $R$-[[modules]] as "$R$-linear spaces". Understood in this generality, linear subspaces are the [[subobjects]] in the [[category of modules]], hence the *[[submodules]]*.
