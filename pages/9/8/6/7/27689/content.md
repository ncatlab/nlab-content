## Definition

Given a [[projective space]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and two projective [[subspaces]] $E,F$ of dimension $m\lt n$, a ([[bijection|bijective]]) [[map]] $f:E\to F$ is called a __central perspectivity__ if there exist a point $O$ which is on neither of the two subspaces such that for each $e\in E$ the points $e,f(e)$ and $O$ are colinear. Point $O$ is then called the *center of the perspectivity*.

A finite composition of perspectivities is called a *projectivity* or *[[projective transformation]]*. 

Two triangles in a projective space (not necessarily in the same plane) are said to be __in a central perspective__ if there exist a point $O$ and a bijection $f$ among their vertices such that for each vertex $x$, the points $x$, $O$ and $f(x)$ are colinear.

In a [[projective plane]], if $A$, $B$ are two points, consider the pencils of all lines $a$ through $A$ and $b$ through $B$. A (bijective) map $f:a\to b$ is an __axial perspectivity__ if there exist a line $p$ not incident with any of the two points $A,B$ such that for each line $q\in a$ through $A$ intersection $p\cap q = p\cap f(q)$.

Two triangles in a projective space are said to be __in an axial perspective__ if there exist a bijection $f$ among the sides $p_1,p_2,p_3$ and $f(p_1),f(p_2),f(p_3)$ of the two triangles such that the three intersections $p_i\cap f(p_i)$ are colinear.

## Properties

Every projectivity among lines in a real plane can be 
presented as a composition of at most 2 perspectivities.

[[Desargues's theorem]] states that two triangles in a projective space over a [[field]] are in a central perspective iff they are in an axial perspective.
