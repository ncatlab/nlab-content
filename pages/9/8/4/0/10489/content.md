
The term "logos" is used

* by [[Heraclitus]] for _[[logos (in philosophy)]]_, something that later was discussed as "logic" in [[Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_.

* in [Freyd-Scedrov](#FreydScedrov) as a synonym for _[[Heyting category]]_;

* in [Joyal 08](#Joyal08) as a synonym for _[[quasi-category]]_ ([[(∞,1)-category]], cf. also *[[Joyal locus]]*);

* in [Joyal 2015](#Joyal15), [Anel & Joyal 2019](#AnelJoyal19), [ABFJ 2023 p. 3](#ABFJ23) for the [[formal duality|formal dual]] of a [[topos]], namely for an object of the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of [[toposes]]. This is along the same lines as the classical [[formal duality]] between [[frames]] and [[locales]] ([[(0,1)-toposes]]) and extends immediately to  [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty,1)$-toposes]] whose [[formal duality|formal duals]] are hence "$(\infty,1)$-logoi" or "$\infty$-logoi", for short;

* in [Anel 2019](#Anel19) for a [[cartesian closed (infinity,1)-category|cartesian closed $\infty$-category]] with [[finite (infinity,1)-limits|finite $\infty$-limits]] and [[van Kampen colimits]] in size bounded by some [[inaccessible cardinal]].

* in [DLL24](#DLL24) for a cocomplete category equipped with a family of limits such that colimits are exact with respect to this family. This paper also discusses the relationship between theirs, Anel-Joyal and Freyd-Scedrov  proposal of logos. Despite being different these proposals all come with similar motivations in mind.
