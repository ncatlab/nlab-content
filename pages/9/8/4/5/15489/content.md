)Finally,Ballard, &#183; SUPER BOWL: TOUCHDOWN TASTES! Friendship69-77&#8212;1465.99.As many of you might know from Ann Marie Shambaugh's editor's note two weeks ago, part of being a cop.NITYANANDA CHANDRA DAS Minister ISKCON Kalachandji??s Hare Krishna Temple DallasWe share your grief My wife spent the entire night off and on crying The Bhagavad Gita explains that we can mourn our separation from that person but we should understand that the self is not subject to deathBg 213 ?? As the embodied soul continuously passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age the soul similarly passes into another body at death A sober person is not bewildered by such a changeBg 217 ?? That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible No one is able to destroy that imperishable soulBg 220 ?? For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time He has not come into being does not come into being and will not come into being He is unborn eternal ever-existing and primeval He is not slain when the body is slainBg 222 ?? As a person puts on new garments giving up old ones the soul similarly accepts new material bodies giving up the old and useless onesBg 223 ?? The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon nor burned by re nor moistened by water nor withered by the windBg 224 ?? This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble and can be neither burned nor dried He is everlasting present everywhere unchangeable immovable and eternally the sameBg 225 ?? It is said that the soul is invisible inconceivable and immutable Knowing this you should not grieve for the bodyWILLIAM LAWRENCE Dean and Professor of American Church History Perkins School of Theology Southern Methodist UniversityEvery person who has had a career in some form of priestly or pastoral ministry has been summoned to a profoundly tragic situation for which there are no rational explanations available A mother learns that her teenage son has died in a one-car wreck and the minister arrives to be a pastoral presence A family learns that their loved one has died in a distant battle in military service and the minister arrives to provide some sort of comfort A child dies from an inoperable untreatable brain tumor and the minister holds vigil with the parents whose grief is unconsolableNot many of us have been drawn into a situation like the massacre in Connecticut where the victims are so numerous and the circumstances so senseless But whether there are dozens of lives lost or just one the questions raised are combinations of demands and protests "How could God let this happen" Or "Where was God in my child's last seconds of life" Outrage is the only legitimate emotion And any member of the clergy who has a pious answer for the questions provoked by the terrible circumstances is either lying about the faith or manipulating the emotions of the victimsThe first pastoral act in such situations is a demonstration of love by sitting in silent respect with the family members and allowing them to grieve to shout at God to dissolve in tears What love should not do in this situation is stifle the feelings of the heart-broken parent or attempt to offer a rational explanation for the events What happened in Connecticut and in similar eruptions of violence elsewhere was an irrational event And God does not need us at that moment to offer some defense of His heavenly dignity Anyone who tries to do so should be silencedThe second pastoral act involves enabling family members and friends to find a ritual that moves beyond the horrors and the grief along some path toward healing The funeral service is the start along that path I recall a time many years ago when a 17-year old girl was seriously injured in an auto crash and lingered in the hospital for a week before succumbing The small Roman Catholic Church where we conducted her funeral was filled with prayers with music and with a steady stream of her classmates coming forward for Communion while a soloist sang "And I will raise Him up on the last day" It made no attempt to offer answers but rather it achieved success at putting the whole community in contact with spiritual resources that will provide more than answersThere will finally one day be a gift of peace It will not be an explanation or an answer But it will be a giftJIM DENISON Theologian-in-Residence Texas Baptist Convention and President Denison Forum on Truth and CultureWe are to be the presence of Christ with those who grieve As God walks with us through the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23:4) we are to walk with those who travel the way of sorrow HowFirst listen Those in grief do not need to hear our words nearly as much as they need us to hear theirs Let them tell their stories and give voice to their pain If Jesus could cry from the cross "My God my God why have you forsaken me" (Matthew 27:46) we can express our doubts and struggles Job's friends were a help to him until they began talkingSecond offer practical help In the midst of unspeakable pain many cannot function in their daily lives They need food someone to clean their home help with paying bills and doing other mundane things They also need help with funeral arrangements they never imagined making and provisions for children who are grieving as wellLast get through today "Tomorrow" doesn't exist This day is the only day there is We will make plans for the future as we must but we need to focus on this day Be present in this moment with these friends and family for this hourThe Christmas promise is that Jesus would be "Immanuel" which means "God with us" (Matthew 1:23) In crisis we are called to prove his love in ours?000 allocation until at least next week.Juveniles can't go to jail.
