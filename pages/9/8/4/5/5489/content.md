Often in mathematics, when requiring some structure/operation/property/... to exist at every [[finite set|finite]] [[arity]], it suffices to require only the binary ($2$-ary) and nullary ($0$-ary) forms, from which the others follow.

For example, in defining a [[category]], one could use an "[[bias|unbiased]]" definition in which [[composites]] of all [[list|finite sequences]] of [[morphisms]] are directly postulated, with corresponding [[associativity]] laws, but it suffices to require only binary composites and nullary composites (i.e., [[identity morphisms]]) and some particular corresponding associativity laws.

As a special case of this, we have perhaps the prototypical example of a binary/nullary pair sufficing to generate all finite instances of some structure: the [[natural numbers]] themselves are the [[free monoid]] on one generator, and thus are freely associatively produced from that one generator (aka, $1$) using only binary and nullary addition.
