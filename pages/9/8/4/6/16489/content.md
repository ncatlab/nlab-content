
A **Fermat number** is a number of the form
$$
F_k = 2^{2^k}+1
$$
for integers $k \geq 0$. A Fermat number that is [[prime number|prime]] is called a **Fermat prime**. 

[[Pierre de Fermat]] conjectured (1640) that all $F_k$ are prime, but $F_5=4294967297$ is composite (641 is a factor, discovered by [[Euler]] in 1732), and in fact (as of 2014) only $F_k$ for $k=0,1,2,3,4$ are known to be prime. Basic questions remain open, such as:

* Are there infinitely many Fermat primes?
* Are there infinitely many composite Fermat numbers?

The Fermat numbers $F_k$ for $k=5,\ldots,32$ are known to be composite, though in some cases no explicit factors are known ($k=20,24$), or incomplete factorisations ($12 \leq k \leq 32$). Isolated other cases are known to be composite, for instance $k=3329780$.

There are heuristic (nonrigorous) arguments that there should be only finitely many Fermat primes, _and_ that Fermat primes have positive [[density of a subset|density]] in the primes; it is impossible that both of these hold, since finite sets have zero density in a countable set like that of the primes. In any case, it is conjectured by various people that: there are only finitely many Fermat primes; there are only five Fermat primes; and that there are finitely many, but more than five (this last position is argued by [[Emil Artin]]).
