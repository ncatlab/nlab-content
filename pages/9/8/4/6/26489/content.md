## Disambiguation

Similar to [[path types]], there are a few different types which can be called *loop types* or *loop space types* in [[dependent type theory]]. 

* The [[identity type]] $x =_A x$ for type $A$ and element $x:A$, which is the type of self-identifications of $x:A$ or the based [[loop space type]] $\Omega_A(x)$ of $x:A$;

* The type of pointed type homomorphisms 
$$S^1 \to_{*} A \equiv \sum_{f:S^1 \to A} f(\mathrm{base}) =_A x$$ 
from the [[circle type]] $S^1$ to a type $A$ with element $x:A$ - this parallels the topological definition of [[loop spaces]] as continuous functions out of the [[unit circle]] to a [[pointed topological space]];

The [[categorical semantics]] of free loop types in any of the above forms is the [[loop space object]]. 

There are also other types which could be called the *free loop type* or *free loop space type*:

* The [[dependent sum type]] $\sum_{x:A} x =_A x$ for type $A$, which is the type of all self-identifications in $A$;

* The function type $S^1 \to A$ from the [[circle type]] $S^1$ to a type $A$ - this parallels the topological definition of [[free loop spaces]] as continuous functions out of the [[unit circle]] to a [[topological space]];

The [[categorical semantics]] of free loop types in any of the above forms is the [[free loop space object]].
