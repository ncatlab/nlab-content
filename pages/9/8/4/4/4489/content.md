_Tomasz Brzezi&#324;ski_ is a Polish-UK mathematician and [[mathematical physicist]] with a position at the University of Swansea, Wales and University of Bia&#322;ystok, Poland. Large part of his work is concerned with [[noncommutative geometry]], especially [[quantum principal bundles]], coalgebraic and Hopf-Galois theories and the aspects of the [[descent theory]] in algebraic context. He has played a large role in the revival of the theory of [[corings]]. With [[Shahn Majid]] he rediscovered the mixed [[distributive laws]] under the name of [[entwining structures]], motivated by the quantum principal bundle theory.
