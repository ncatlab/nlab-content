## Idea

Where a system of [[quantum mechanics]] is specified by

* a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$;

* a [[hermitean operator]] $H$  on $\mathcal{H}$ -- the [[Hamiltonian]];

a system of _supersymmetric quantum mechanics_ has 

* a [[super Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$;

* an odd [[linear operator]] $D$ in $\mathcal{H}$, the [[supercharge]]

* such that $D \circ D = H$ is the [[Hamiltonian]].

If we regard the Hamiltonian as the generator of the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] in one dimension -- the  [[super translation Lie algebra]] --, then the graded commutator $[D,D] = 2 H$ is the [[supersymmetry]] extension to the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] in super-dimension $(1|1)$.

The data of a system of supersymmetric quantum mechanics may also be formalized in terms of a [[spectral triple]].

## Properties


### Relation to spinning particles
 {#RelationToSpinningParticles}

A simple but often underappreciated fact is that the [[worldline theory]] of any [[spinning particle]] is supersymmetric, and hence is supersymmetric quantum mechanics, _on the [[worldline]]_. In this sense relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics is not the exception but the rule, it is something exhibited by every [[fermion]] in the world. See at _[spinning particle -- Worldline supersymmetry](spinning+particle#WorldlineSupersymmetry)_for more on this. 

Of course the bulk of the literature considers non-relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics. That is much less relevant in nature. 


### Relation to index theory
 {#RelationToIndexTheory}

Another fairly simple but very deep fact is that the [[partition function]] of a supersymmetric [[quantum mechanical system]], namely the [[supertrace]] of its propagator, is equivalently what in mathematics (in [[index theory]]) is called the [[index]] of the supercharge regarded as a [[Fredholm operator]]. See the references [below](#ReferencesRelationToIndexTheory) for more on this.

This relation is at the heart of a deep and ubiquituous role that supersymmetric quantum mechanics plays in the [[mathematics]] of [[K-theory]] and related topics (and vice versa). For a general abstract discussion of why there is such a relation see also at _[super algebra -- Abstract idea](super+algebra#AbstractIdea)_ and at _[[super line 2-bundle]]_.




### Relation to Morse theory

For the moment see [below](#ReferencesRelationToMorseTheory).

### Relation to superstrings
 {#RelationToSuperstrings}

Supersymmetric quantum mechanics was introduced or at least became famous with ([Witten 82](#Wittem82)). As explained at the end of ([Witten 85](#Witten85)), [[Edward Witten|Witten]] had come to consider this while looking at the point particle limit of the [[superstring]] [[sigma-model]]. The superstring sigma-model is a kind of supersymmetric quantum mechanics on [[loop space]] (see also at [[2-spectral triple]]) and ordinary supersymmetric quantum mechanics is obtained from this in the limit of vanishing loop size (see e.g [Schreiber 04](#Schreiber04)). Under this identification the above discussion of [[index theory]] translates to Witten's interpretation of the universal [[elliptic genus]] as what is now known as the _[[Witten genus]]_ (see there for more).

One way to make this rigorously precise would be to realize the [[Dirac-Ramond operator]] of the [[superstring]] as an actual [[Dirac operator on smooth loop space]] (the string's [[Wheeler superspace]]), as originally suggested in ([Witten 87b](#Witten87b)).

### Relation to Morse theory and string theory
 {#ReferencesRelationToMorseTheory}

Supersymmetric quantum mechanics gained attention with the work

* {#Witten82} [[Edward Witten]], _Supersymmetry and Morse theory_  J. Differential Geom. **17** 4 (1982) 661-692. &lbrack;[euclid:jdg/1214437492](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437492), [pdf](http://www.cimat.mx/~gil/docencia/2012/teoria_de_morse/witten_supersymmetry_and_morse_theory.pdf), [spire:176416](http://inspirehep.net/record/176416)&rbrack;

which showed that [[Morse theory]] may be equivalently interpreted as the study of [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[vacua]] in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and  which was part of what gained Witten the [Fields medal 1990](http://159.226.47.99:8080/general/prize/medal/1990.htm). In this article a certain family of deformations of [[superparticles]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] are considered and the supersymmetric ground states are shown to be given by the [[Morse theory]] of the deformation function. 

For a survey of the relation to Morse theory see for instance

* [[Gábor Pete]], section 2 of _Morse theory_, lecture notes 1999-2001   ([pdf](http://www.math.bme.hu/~gabor/morse.pdf))

* Rohit Jain, _Supersymmetric Schr&#246;dinger operators with applications to Morse theory_ ([pdf](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/rjain/SUSY.pdf))

This deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics arises as the point-particle limit of the [[type II superstring]] regarded as [[quantum mechanics]] on the [[smooth loop space]] (the string's [[Wheeler superspace]]), a relation that is stated more explicitly in 

* {#Witten85} [[Edward Witten]], p. 92-94 in: *Global anomalies in string theory*, in: W. Bardeen and A. White (eds.) *[Symposium on Anomalies, Geometry, Topology](https://inspirehep.net/conferences/965785?ui-citation-summary=true)*, World Scientific (1985) 61-99 &lbrack;[[WittenGlobalAnomaliesInStringTheory.pdf:file]], [spire:214913](https://inspirehep.net/literature/214913)&rbrack;

and then in

* {#Witten87b} [[Edward Witten]], *The Index Of The Dirac Operator In Loop Space*, in: *Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms in Algebraic Topology*, Lecture Notes in Mathematics **1326**, Springer (1988) 161-181 &lbrack;[doi:10.1007/BFb0078045](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0078045), [spire](http://inspirehep.net/record/245523)&rbrack;

The relation between the 2d [[SCFT]] describing the [[type II superstring]] and this deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics on [[smooth loop space]] has been further explored in 

* {#Schreiber04} [[Urs Schreiber]], _On deformations of 2d SCFTs_, JHEP 0406:058,2004 ([arXiv:hep-th/0401175](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0401175))
