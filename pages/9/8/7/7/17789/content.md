## Idea
A Newton-Cartan structure on a [[4-manifold]] gives the manifold the structure of a non-relativistic Newtonian [[spacetime]].

###### Definition
Let $M$ be a 4-manifold. A **Newton-Cartan structure** consists of

 * A degenerate symmetric [[bivector]] $h : M \to S^2 (TM)$ of signature $(0, +, +, +)$.
 * A [[1-form]] $\theta: M \to T^*M$ that lies in the kernel of $h$ viewed as a map $T^*M \to TM$.
 * A [[torsion of a metric connection|torsion-free]] [[affine connection]] $\nabla$ such that $\nabla h = 0$ and $\nabla \theta = 0$.

Note that unlike [[Riemannian metrics]], the connection is not uniquely specified by $h$ and $\theta$.
