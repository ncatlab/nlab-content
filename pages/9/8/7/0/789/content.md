_Generalized complex geometry_ was propsoed by [[Nigel Hitchin]] as a formalism in [[differential geometry]] that would be suited to capture the phenomena that physicists encountered in the study of [[T-duality]].

It was later and is still developed by his students, notably Gualtieri and Cavalcanti.

Generalized complex geometry generalizes and unifies both

* [[complex geometry]]

and

* [[symplectic geometry]].

The basic idea is to study not just the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ or cotangent bundle $T^* X$ of a [[manifold]], but a certain [[Courant algebroid]] whose underlying [[vector bundle]] is the [[direct sum]] $T X \oplus T^* X$.
