## Idea

What is called _generalized complex geometry_ is the study of the geometry of [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid|symplectic Lie 2-algebroid]] called [[standard Courant algebroid]]s $\mathfrak{c}(X)$ (over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$). 

This geometry of symplectic Lie 2-algebroids turns out to unify, among other things, [[complex geometry]] with [[symplectic geometry]]. This unification notably captures central aspects of [[T-duality]].


## Properties

One finds (as described at [[standard Courant algebroid]]) that

* choices of sub-[[Lie algebroid]]s of $\mathfrak{c}(X)$ encode **[[Dirac structure]]s** and -- after [[complexification]] -- **generalized [[complex structure]]s**;

* choices of [[section]]s of the canonical morphism $\mathfrak{c}(X) \to T X$ to the [[tangent Lie algebroid]]s encode **generalized Riemannian metrics**: pairs consisting of a (possibly [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian metric]] and a [[differential form|2-form]].

  In applications in [[string theory]], this encodes the field of [[gravity]] and the [[Kalbâ€“Ramond field]], respectively. (There are also proposals for how the [[dilaton]] field appears in this context.)

In components these are structures found on the [[vector bundle]]

$$
  T X \oplus T^* X
  \,,
$$

the [[direct sum]] of the [[tangent bundle]] with the cotangent bundle of $X$. 

Generalized complex geometry thus generalizes and unifies

* [[complex geometry]],
* [[symplectic geometry]], and
* [[Riemannian geometry]].

It was in particular motivated by the observation that this provides a natural formalism for describing [[T-duality]].



## References

Generalized complex geometry was proposed by [[Nigel Hitchin]] as a formalism in [[differential geometry]] that would be suited to capture the phenomena that physicists encountered in the study of [[T-duality]].
It was later and is still developed by his students, notably Gualtieri and Cavalcanti.
