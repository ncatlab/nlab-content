
Especially in [[physics]] there are some types of [[equations]] that in their subfield are called _master equations_. Examples include the following:

1. in [[BV-BRST formalism]] the _classical master equation_ is the condition that the refinement of an [[action functional]] to a function on its [[derived critical locus]] squares to 0 with respect to a certain graded Poisson-bracket. The _quantum master equation_ is a deformation of this equation. See at _[[BV-BRST formalism]]_ for details on all this.

1. in [[statistical mechanics]], Langevin equation and generalizations

1. linear evolutionary differential equations (often for operator functions) of the form $d y/ d t = L y$ where $L$ is a linear operator not involving differentiating with respect to time is sometimes called a master equation in some contexts
