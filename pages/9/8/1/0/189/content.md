A _quiver_ is a free category on a [[directed graph]]. Given a directed graph $G$ with collection of vertices $G_0$ and collection of edges $G_1$, there is the free category $F(G)$ on the graph whose collection of objects coincides with the collection of vertices, and whose collection of morphisms consists of finite sequences of edges in $G$ that fit together head-to-tail. The composition operation in this free category is the concatenation of sequences of edges.




Here we taking advantage of the [[adjunction]] between [[Cat]] (the category of small categories) and [[DiGraph]] (the category of directed graphs).  Namely, any category has an underlying directed graph:

$$U : Cat \to DiGraph $$

and the left adjoint of this functor gives the free category on a directed graph:

$$F : DiGraph \to Cat $$

A [[representation]] of a quiver $Q = F(G)$ is a functor

$$R : Q \to Vect $$

Concretely, such a thing assigns a vector space to each vertex of the graph $G$, and a linear operator to each edge.  Representations of quivers are fascinating things, with connections to ADE theory, quantum groups, string theory, and more.

he defines a quiver as a [[directed graph]]. Then it seems like the [[path algebra]] is the category generated by the quiver. It seems the literature might be inconsistent in the naming conventions? Perhaps we need to settle the convention for nLab.

The wikipedia page also defines a quiver as a [[directed graph]]. It has a blurb about a categorical definition, but it doesn't seem to be consistent with the previous definition (?)

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: You are right, Eric, I think John "played Bourbaki" a bit when he wrote the above. I have added the comment to below in an attempt to clarify the situation.

In the literature, a **quiver** is usually defined as nothing but a [[directed graph]]. The point of this redundant use of terminology is that when people call their [[directed graph]]s "quivers", they indicate that they want to perform certain operations on it, such as, notably,  considering its [[quiver algebra]]. But this really means that they consider precisely the free category generated by the quiver. For that reason it makes sense to define, as above, that "quiver" really refers to the free category over a [[directed graph]]. This definition is arguably more sensible than the standard one, which is just redundant -- but it is non-standard.

These references need to be cleaned up. There are also many more to be added.
