A _quiver_ is a free category on a [[directed graph]]. Given a directed graph $G$ with collection of vertices $G_0$ and collection of edges $G_1$, there is the free category $F(G)$ on the graph whose collection of objects coincides with the collection of vertices, and whose collection of morphisms consists of finite [[sequence]]s of edges in $G$ that fit together head-to-tail. The composition operation in this free category is the concatenation of sequences of edges.




Here we taking advantage of the [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] between [[Cat]] (the category of small categories) and [[DiGraph]] (the category of directed graphs).  Namely, any category has an underlying directed graph:

$$U : Cat \to DiGraph $$

and the left adjoint of this functor gives the free category on a directed graph:

$$F : DiGraph \to Cat $$

A [[representation]] of a quiver $Q = F(G)$ is a functor

$$R : Q \to Vect $$

Concretely, such a thing assigns a vector space to each vertex of the graph $G$, and a linear operator to each edge.  Representations of quivers are fascinating things, with connections to ADE theory, quantum groups, string theory, and more.

#Remarks#

In the literature, a **quiver** is usually defined as nothing but a [[directed graph]]. The point of this redundant use of terminology is that when people call their [[directed graph]]s "quivers", they indicate that they want to perform certain operations on it, such as, notably,  considering its [[quiver algebra]]. But this really means that they consider precisely the free category generated by the quiver. For that reason it makes sense to define, as above, that "quiver" really refers to the free category over a [[directed graph]]. This definition is arguably more sensible than the standard one, which is just redundant -- but it is non-standard.

he defines a quiver as a [[directed graph]]. Then it seems like the [[quiver algebra|path algebra]] is the category generated by the quiver. It seems the literature might be inconsistent in the naming conventions? Perhaps we need to settle the convention for nLab.

The wikipedia page also defines a quiver as a [[directed graph]]. It has a blurb about a categorical definition, but it doesn't seem to be consistent with the previous definition (?)

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: You are right, Eric, I think John "played Bourbaki" a bit when he wrote the above. I have added a comment in an attempt to clarify the situation.

_[[John Baez|John]] says_: Yes, I played Bourbaki, trying to add some clarity to the usual treatment of quivers by recognizing that what people always _do_ with quivers is treat them as the free categories on directed graphs!  And after all, if you _don't_ want to take the free category on your directed graph, why bother calling it a 'quiver'?  You might as well call it a 'directed graph'!  

In short, my definition fits what people actually do with quivers, and saves 'quiver' from being a redundant synonym for 'directed graph'.   

By the way, quivers are called 'quivers' because they're a [bunch of arrows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver).

The Wikipedia entry on [the mathematics of quivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_(mathematics)) says that a categorical definition of quiver can be given, but doesn't actually give it: it says a quiver can be considered as a category, but it doesn't say precisely which kind of category.  But, people know which kind: a free category on a directed graph.

Also by the way, I've moved this down here because I imagine many pages on the $n$Lab will gradually acquire long and interesting discussions which we don't want stuck right in the middle of the main stuff.  Wikipedia has 'talk pages' for this purpose.

I removed the green 'query' box, which gets a bit inconvenient when the discussion gets long. But, it might be nice to have this sort of discussion be visibly different from the main article.
