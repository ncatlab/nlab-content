## Definition

The [[core]] of [[FinSet]], hence the [[category]] of [[finite sets]] and [[bijections]] ([[permutations]]) between them, is sometimes called the _permutation category_ and sometimes denoted $\mathbb{P}$.

Sometime else is called the _symmetric groupoid_ and denoted $\mathbb{S}$.
