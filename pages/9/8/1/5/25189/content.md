## construction
to cunstruct the E8 lattice we can start with the following points in 8 [[dimension]]s:

 - (1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0)

 - (0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0)

 - (0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0)

 - (0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0)

 - (0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0)

 - (0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0)

 - (0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0)

 - (-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$,-$\frac{1}{2}$)

Repeatedly adding and subtracting these
points we create the entire infinite E8 lattice.

## applications
In 2022 [[Maryna Viazovska]] got the fields medal for her proofs of the optimal [[sphere packing]] in 8 dimensions using this lattice and the optimal [[sphere packing]] in 24 dimensions using the [[Leech lattice]].

The optimal sphere packing constant in 8th dimensions is $\frac{\pi^4}{384} \approx 0.2537$

## properties
If we put spheres of radius $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ on every point of the lattice, then each sphere touches 240 other spheres.
