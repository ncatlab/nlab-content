## Idea

The *$E_8$ lattice* is an exceptional [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice inside]] $\mathbb{R}^8$.

## Definition

The $E_8$-lattice may be presented as the [[linear span]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]] of the following [[linear basis|basis vectors]] in the [[real vector space]] $\mathbb{R}^8$:

 - $(1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0)$

 - $(0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0)$

 - $(0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0)$

 - $(0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0)$

 - $(0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0)$

 - $(0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0)$

 - $(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0)$

 - $\big(-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\big)$

### Relation to sphere packing
 {#RelationToSpherePacking}

If [[7-spheres]] of [[radius]] $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ are centered around every point of the $E_8$ lattice, then each sphere touches 240 other spheres.

A [[proof]] that this arrangement gives the optimal [[sphere packing]] in 8 dimensions was given in [Viazovska (2016)](#Viazovska16). (The analogous statement holds in 24 dimensions with respect to the [[Leech lattice]] &lbrack;[CKMRV17](sphere+packing#CKMRV17)&rbrack;.)

The optimal sphere packing constant in 8 dimensions is $\frac{\pi^4}{384} \approx 0.2537$
