A [[group]] $H$ is called _quasisimple_ if and only if $H=[H,H]$ and $H/Z(H)$ is [[simple group|simple]]. The [[finite group|finite]] quasisimple groups have been classified, as a consequence of the classification of finite [[simple group]]s and the calculation of the [[Schur multiplier]] of each finite simple group.
