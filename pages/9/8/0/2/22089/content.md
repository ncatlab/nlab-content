* {#Pontrjagin38} [[Lev Pontrjagin]]:

  **Classification of continuous maps of a complex into a sphere**,

or rather about its belated exposition in

on [[differential topology]], establishing the [[Pontryagin isomorphism]] between unstable [[Cohomotopy]] and [[cobordism classes]] of [[normally framed submanifolds]], and applying it to the computation of the lowest couple of [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].

Together with 

* {#Thom54} [[René Thom]], _[[Quelques propriétés globales des variétés différentiables]]_, Comment. Math. Helv. 28, (1954). 17-86 ([doi:10.1007/BF02566923](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02566923), [dml:139072](https://eudml.org/doc/139072), [pdf](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/thomcob.pdf)),

due to which Pontryagin's construction came to be mainly known as the _[[Pontryagin-Thom construction]]_, this lays the foundations of [[cobordism theory]] as such and as a tool in [[stable homotopy theory]].
