## Idea

The _Beilinson-Drinfeld cup product_ is an explicit presentation of the [[cup product]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] for the case that the latter is modeled by the [[Deligne complex]]. It sends

$$
\cup: A[p]^\infty_D\otimes B[q]^\infty_D\to (A\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} B)[p+q]^\infty_D,
$$
where $A$ and $B$ are lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\mathbb{R}^m$ for some $n$ and $m$, respectively. 
It is a morphism of complexes, so it induces a cup product in [[Deligne cohomology]]. 

For $A=B=\mathbb{Z}$, the Beilinson-Deligne cup product is associative and commutative up to homotopy, so it induces an associative and commutatvive cup product on [[ordinary differential cohomology|differential cohomology]]
