##Â Definition ##

A [[graph|directed loop graph]] is **dense** if for every [[pair]] of [[vertices]] $a:V$ and $b:V$ with an [[edge]] $a \to b$, there exists a vertex $c:V$ with edges $a \to c$ and $c \to b$. 

A [[binary endorelation]] is **dense** if it is the edge relation of a dense directed loop graph.
