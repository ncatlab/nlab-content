## Idea

A __grammar__ is an explicit or implicit set/system of organizational rules governing some system of signs (see *[[semiotics]]*), for example a cultural code, a language, or a [[formal logic|logical system]].
In particular, a grammar should help distinguish well-formed or meaningful expressions. Regarding that the meaning of a sign is part of the system, grammars in general may contain rules concerning or depending on [[semantics]], though sometimes one restricts grammar to form.

It is widely believed that advanced _cognition_ itself includes intermediate representations which is symbolic and uses intermediate signs and their grammar. 
Patterns like analogies which contain placeholders to fill can also be viewed as part of grammar. 

Vocabulary (the list of signs) itself is usually, from the point of view of a grammar, considered as an open class  (that is, they can in principle be extended) hence it is not viewed as a part of a grammar, except for a special reserved signs (for example auxiliary verbs in a language grammar) which are typically viewed within closed classes (the lists which are considered exhaustive). 

## In linguistics

In [[linguistics]], a _descriptive grammar_ is an explicit grammar of some language/idiom. That is not the natural grammar itself but the scientific account of it (for example, Panini's grammar of Sanskrit which is a particular record writen in verse). A _prescriptive grammar_ is an explicit set of rules of advices how to attain to some norm of a language.
Linguists consider prescriptive grammars political or social construct rather than linguistical (scientific) though they may include the research into tradition and norm and some experience with socially popular practice. In ideal, a descriptive grammar should include information on variation, but often does not and is received often as prescriptive. A scientifically sound descriptive ground should never hesitate to include phrases/idioms which look  as lacking some logics, if they are not etymologically sound or not confirming to some general rules (or its original usage in history) if such idioms indeed appear often in practice (for example usage of double negation meaning single negation etc.). 

Notable modern theories of grammar in linguistics include generative grammar, transformational grammar, cognitive grammar, functional grammar, generative semantics etc.

Generative semantics in linguistics has the basic thesis that the computation of syntactic structures is driven by the semantic meaning of constituents
