###### Definition

In the context of [[Goodwillie calculus]]: Polynomial (∞,1)-functors, sometimes known simply as *polynomial functors* (but not to be confused with [[polynomial functors]]), are (∞,1)-functors which are [[n-excisive (∞,1)-functor|n-excisive]] for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Such a functor has degree $k$ when the smallest value of $n$ for which it is $n$-excisive is $k$.

###### Remark

An (∞,1)-functor may be approximated by polynomial (∞,1)-functors of any degree, see at _[[Goodwillie-Taylor tower]]_.

###### Remark

A polynomial (∞,1)-functor of degree $k$ is a **homogeneous** polynomial if its approximation by an $(k-1)$ degree polynomial is trivial.
