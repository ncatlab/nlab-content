For some applications, as for instance for the description of [[principal infinity-bundle]]s as [[torsor]]s, it may be convenient to 

* use [[simplicial groupoid]]s instead of [[Kan complex]]es or [[simplicial set]]s;

* use a model structure on (pre)sheaves with values in [[simplicial groupoid]]s instead of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] (see there for motivation on why to consider these models in the first place).
