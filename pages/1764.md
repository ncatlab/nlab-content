The model structure on presheaves of simplicial groupoids is one of the [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]]. It is a slight variant on the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. (At that link more general information is collected).



For various applications it is useful to 

* use [[simplicial groupoid]]s instead of [[Kan complex]]es or [[simplicial set]]s;

* use a model structure on (pre)sheaves with values in [[simplicial groupoid]]s instead of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] (see there for motivation on why to consider these models in the first place).

An example is the discussion of [[principal infinity-bundle]]s in section 3 of 

* Jardine, Luo, _Higher order principal bundles_ ([web](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0681/))
