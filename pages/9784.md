## Idea

A **precompact set** is one whose completion is compact.  This makes sense for [[uniform spaces]] but not for [[topological spaces]].  It is one of the useful types of subset of a [[locally convex topological vector space]], particularly with regard to defining topologies on [[linear dual|dual spaces]].


## Definitions

###### Definition
A uniform space $P$ is **precompact** if its completion is compact.

A subset of a uniform space is **precompact** if it is precompact for the inherited uniformity.
