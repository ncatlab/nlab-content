## Idea 

The idea of a commutative monad could be motivated as either

* The [[monad]] equivalent of a [[commutative algebraic theory]], generalized to either non-finitary theories or to categories other than [[Set]];
* A [[monad]] on a [[monoidal category]] whose underlying functor is [[monoidal functor|lax monoidal]], and whose unit and multiplication are [[monoidal natural transformation|monoidal]]. The interpretation is that the monad plays well with the monoidal product of the category, encoding for example products of formal expressions;
* A [[monad]] on a [[monoidal category]] whose [[strong monad|strength]] and [[strong monad|costrength]] commute with each other. 

It turns out that all these concepts coincide (see below, as well as the articles on [[commutative algebraic theories]] and [[monoidal monads]]).


## Definition 

Let $(T,\mu,\eta)$ be a [[monad]] on a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $C$, equipped with a [[strong monad|strength]] $\sigma$ (and with the costrength $\tau$ induced from $\sigma$ and the [[braiding]]). 

We say that $T$ (or $\sigma$) is **commutative** if the following diagram commutes for all objects $X$ and $Y$ of $C$. 
\begin{tikzcd}
			TX \otimes TY \ar{d}{\tau} \ar{r}{\sigma} & T(TX\otimes Y) \ar{r}{T\tau} & TT(X\otimes Y) \ar{d}{\mu} \\
			T(X\otimes TY) \ar{r}{T\sigma} & TT(X\otimes Y) \ar{r}{\mu} & T(X\otimes Y)
\end{tikzcd}


## Equivalence with monoidal monads

A commutative monad is equivalently a [[monoidal monad]], namely a [[monad#definition|monad in the bicategory]] of [[monoidal categories]], [[lax monoidal functors]] and [[monoidal natural transformations]]. 

For the details see [[monoidal monad]].



## Tensor product of algebras and multimorphisms

In many situations, [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] over a commutative monad are canonically equipped with a [[tensor product]] analogous to the [[tensor product of modules]] over a ring. 
In particular, commutative monads come equipped with a notion of [[multimorphisms]] of algebras, analogous to [[bilinear]] and [[multilinear maps]].

For the details, see [[tensor product of algebras over a commutative monad]], and the [[tensor product of algebras over a commutative monad#bimorphisms_and_universal_property|section on the universal property]] for multimorphisms. 


## Examples

In many of the examples, one can see how the property of commutativity (as opposed to just the structure of a [[strong monad|strength]]) has really the meaning of the operations being commutative.

* The free _commutative_ monoid monad on [[Set]] is commutative, the free monoid monad is not.
* If $M$ is a [[monoid]], the "action monad" $X\mapsto M\times X$ on [[Set]] is commutative if and only if $M$ is commutative as a monoid. 
* More generally, in an arbitrary [[symmetric monoidal category]], the monad induced by tensoring with an [[internal monoid]] is commutative if and only the monoid object is commutative. (See for example [Brandenburg, Example 6.3.12](#Brandenburg2014).)

Since commutative monads are the same as monoidal monads, monads encoding structures which admit products are commutative:

* Most [[probability monads]] are commutative, with monoidal structure given by forming the [[product probability]].
* The [[power set]] monad is commutative, with monoidal structure given by forming the product of subsets.


For a concrete example, consider the free commutative monoid monad $T$, and given a set $X$, write the elements of $TX$ as formal sums, such as $x_1+x_2$.  
The commutativity condition says that these two compositions have the same result,
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=0]
TX \times TY \ar{r}{\sigma} & T(TX\times Y) \ar{r}{T\tau} & TT(X\times Y) \ar{r}{\mu} & T(X\times Y) \\
(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1+x_2, y_1) + (x_1+x_2, y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & ((x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_1)) + ((x_1, y_2) + (x_2, y_2)) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_1) + (x_1, y_2) + (x_2, y_2)
\end{tikzcd}
and
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=0]
TX \times TY \ar{r}{\tau} & T(X\times TY) \ar{r}{T\sigma} & TT(X\times Y) \ar{r}{\mu} & T(X\times Y) \\
(x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1, y_1+y_2) + (x_2, y_1+y_2) \ar[mapsto]{r} & ((x_1, y_1) + (x_1, y_2)) + ((x_2, y_1) + (x_2, y_2)) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1, y_1) + (x_1, y_2) + (x_2, y_1) + (x_2, y_2)
\end{tikzcd}
Note that these two expressions are not the same on the nose, they are the same because addition is commutative.
