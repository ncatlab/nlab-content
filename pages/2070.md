A __regular element__ of a [[Heyting algebra]] is an element $x$ such that $\neg{\neg{x}} = x$.

Thus a [[Boolean algebra]] is precisely a Heyting algebra in which every element is regular.

As a special case, a __regular open__ in a [[locale]] $S$ is a regular element of $S$ as a [[frame]].

Analogously, a __regular open set__ in a [[topological space]] $X$ is a regular element of the frame of open sets of $X$; equivalently, an open set which equals the interior of its closure, or equivalently the exterior of its exterior.  (This is the origin of the term, related to a [[regular space]].)

The __regularisation__ of $x$ is $\neg{\neg{x}}$; note that this is regular.  In fact, any element of the form $\neg{y}$ is regular.
