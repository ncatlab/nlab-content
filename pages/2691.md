#Defintion#

Write $dgRing$ for the [[category]] of [[monoid]]s in the category of [[cochain complex]]es of abelian groups.

A [[dg-algebra]] is a dg-ring that is degreewise a $k$-[[vector spac]e] over some field $k$.

###### Definition

The  **projective** [[model category]] structure on $dgRing$ is given by setting:

* weak equivalences are the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s

* fibrations are the degreewise surjections.

###### Proposition

This indeed defines a [[model category]] and in fact a [[cofibrantly generated model category]].

###### Proof
