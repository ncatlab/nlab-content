## Idea 

A [[model category]] structure on a category of [[dg-algebra]]s tends to present an [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-algebra over an (∞,1)-algebraic theory|∞-algebras]]. 

For dg-algebras bounded in negative or positive degrees, the [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] asserts that their model category structures are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the corresponding [[model structure on simplicial algebras|model structure on (co)simplicial algebras]]. This case plays a central role in [[rational homotopy theory]].

The case of model structures on unbounded dg-algebras may be thought of as induced from this by passage to the [[derived geometry]] modeled on formal duals of the bounded dg-algebras. This is described at [[dg-geometry]].


## General

The category of [[dg-algebra]]s is that of [[monoid]]s in a [[category of chain complexes]]. Accordingly general results on a [[model structure on monoids in a monoidal model category]] apply.  

Below we spellout special cases, such as restricting to commutative monoids when working over a field of characteristic 0, or restricting to non-negatively graded cochain dg-algebras.

## Non-negatively graded cochain dg-algebras

### Definition 

Write $dgAlg$ for the [[category]] of cochain [[dg-algebra]]s in non-negative degree over a [[field]] $k$ of characteristic 0. Write $C dgAlg \subset dgAlg$ for the [[subcategory]] of (graded-)commutative dg-algebras.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The  **projective** [[model category]] structure on $C dgAlg$ and on $dgAlg$ is given by setting:

* weak equivalences are the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s

* fibrations are the degreewise [[epimorphism|surjections]].

=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

This indeed defines a [[model category]]. 

At least on $C dgAlg$ this is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

See the references below.

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark
**(category of fibrant objects)**

Evidently every object in $dgAlg$ and in $C dgAlg$ is fibrant. Therefore these model categories structures are in particular also structures of a [[category of fibrant objects]].

=--

The nature of the cofibrations is discussed below.


### Properties

#### Cofibrations: Sullivan algebras {#SullivanAlgebras}

In this section we describe the cofibrations in the model structure on $C dgAlg_\mathbb{N}$ of **non-negatively graded** dg-algebras. Notice that it is these that are in the image of the dual [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]].

Before we characterize the cofibrations, first some notation.

For $V$ a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded vector space]] write 
$\wedge^\bullet V$ for the [[Grassmann algebra]] over it. Equipped with the trivial differential $d = 0$ this is a [[semifree dga]] $(\wedge^\bullet V, d=0)$.

With $k$ our ground field we write $(k,0)$ for the corresponding dg-algebra, the tensor unit for the standard [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] on $dgAlg$. This is the [[Grassmann algebra]] on the 0-vector space
$(k,0) = (\wedge^\bullet 0, 0)$.


+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition
**(Sullivan algebras)**

A **relatived Sullivan algebra** is a [[morphism]] of dg-algebras that is an inclusion

$$
  (A,d) \to (A \otimes_k \wedge^\bullet V, d')
$$

for $(A,d)$ some dg-algebra and for $V$ some graded vector space, such that 

* there is a [[well ordered set]] $J$

* indexing a basis $\{v_\alpha \in V| \alpha \in J\}$ of $V$;

* such that with $V_{\lt \beta} = span(v_\alpha | \alpha \lt \beta)$ for all basis elements $v_\beta$ we have that 

  $$
    d' v_\beta \in A \otimes \wedge^\bullet V_{\lt \beta}
    \,.
  $$

This is called a **minimal** relative Sullivan algebra if in addition the condition

$$
  (\alpha \lt \beta) \Rightarrow (deg v_\alpha  \leq deg v_\beta)
$$

holds. For a Sullivan algebra $(k,0) \to (\wedge^\bullet V, d)$ relative to the tensor unit we call the [[semifree dga]] $(\wedge^\bullet V,d)$ simply a **Sullivan algebra**.  And a **minimal Sullivan algebra** if $(k,0) \to (\wedge^\bullet V, d)$ is a minimal relative Sullivan algebra.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

Sullivan algebras were introduced by [[Dennis Sullivan]] in his development of [[rational homotopy theory]]. This is one of the key application areas of the model structure on dg-algebras.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark
**($L_\infty$-algebras)**

Because they are [[semifree dga]]s, Sullivan dg-algebras $(\wedge^\bullet V,d)$ are (at least for degreewise finite dimensional $V$) [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s of [[L-∞-algebra]]s.

The co-commutative differential co-algebra encoding the corresponding [[L-∞-algebra]] is the free cocommutative algebra $\vee^\bullet V^*$ on the degreewise dual of $V$ with differential $D = d^*$, i.e. the one given by the formula

$$
  \omega(D(v_1 \vee v_2 \vee \cdots v_n)) =
  - (d \omega) (v_1, v_2, \cdots,  v_n)
$$

for all $\omega \in V$ and all $v_i \in V^*$.

=--


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition
**(cofibrations are relative Sullivan algebras)**

The cofibration in $C dgAlg_{\mathbb{N}}$ are precisely the [[retract]]s of relative  Sullivan algebras $(A,d) \to (A\otimes_k \wedge^\bullet V, d')$.

Accordingly, the cofibrant objects in $C dgAlg$ are precisely the Sullivan algebras $(\wedge^\bullet V, d)$

=--

+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition
**(sphere and disk algebras)**

Write $k[n]$ for the graded vector space which is the ground field $k$ in degree $n$ and 0 in all other degrees. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the [[semifree dga]]s

$$
  S(n) := (\wedge^\bullet k[n], 0)
$$ 

and for $n \geq 1$ the [[semifree dga]]

$$
  D(n) := 
   \left\lbrace
     \array{
         0 & (n = 0)
         \\
        (\wedge^\bullet (k[n+1] \oplus k[n]), 0) & (n \gt 0)
     }
   \right.
  \,.
$$ 

Write

$$
  i_n : S(n) \to D(n)
$$

for the obvious morphism that takes the generator in degree $n$ to the generator in degree $n$ (and for $n = 0$ it is the unique morphism from the [[initial object]] $(0,0)$).

For $n \gt 0$ write

$$
  j_n : 0 \to D(n)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition
**(generating cofibrations)**

The sets

$$
  I = \{i_n \}_n \cup \{S(0) \to 0\}
$$

and 

$$
  J = \{j_n \}_{n \gt 0} 
$$

are sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, respectively, exhibiting $C dgAlg$ as a [[cofibrantly generated model category]].

#### Commutative vs. non-commutative dg-algebras {#CommVsNoncomm}

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Observation


The [[stuff, structure, property|forgetful functor]]

$$
  F :  CdgAlg \to dgAlg
$$

from (graded-)commutative [[dg-algebra]]s to dg-algebras is the [[right adjoint]] part of a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  Ab
  :
  dgAlg 
   \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  CdgAlg
  :
  F
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The forgetful functor clearly preserves fibrations and cofibrations. It has a [[left adjoint]], the free abelianization functor $Ab$, which sends a [[dg-algebra]] $A$ to its quotient $A/[A,A]$.

=--


+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

Let the ground [[ring]] $k$ be a [[field]] of characteristic 0. Then every [[dg-algebra]] $A$ which has the structure of an [[algebra over an operad|algebra over]] the [[E-k-operad|E-∞ operad]] has a [[dg-algebra]] morphism $A \to A_c$ to a commutative dg-algebra $A_c$  which is

* a morphism of [[E-k-operad|E-∞ algebras]] (where $A_c$ has the obvious [[E-k-operad|E-∞ algebras]] structure)

* a weak weak equivalence in the model structure on dg-algebras (i.e. a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of the underlying cochain complexes).

=--

So this says that the weak equivalence classes of the commutative dg-algebras in the model category of all dg-algebras already exhaust the most general non-commutative but  homotopy-commutative dg-algebras.

## Unbounded dg-algebras {#Unbounded}

We discuss now the case of unbounded dg-algebras. For these there is no longer the [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] available. Instead, these can be understood as arising naturally as function $\infty$-algebras in the [[derived geometry|derived]] [[dg-geometry]] over formal duals of bounded dg-algebras, see [[function algebras on ∞-stacks]].

### Gradings and conventions {#GradingsAndConventions}

In [[derived geometry]] two categorical gradings interact: a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive]] $\infty$-groupoid $X$ has a space of [[k-morphism]]s $X_k$ for all non-negative $k$, and each such has itself a _[[simplicial T-algebra]]_ of functions with a component in each non-positive degree. But the directions of the face maps are opposite. We recall the grading situation from [[function algebras on ∞-stacks]].

Functions on a bare $\infty$-groupoid $K$, modeled as a [[simplicial set]], form a [[cosimplicial algebra]] $\mathcal{O}(K)$, which under the [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] identifies with a cochain [[dg-algebra]] (meaning: with positively graded differential) in non-negative degree

$$
  \left(
    \array{
        \vdots
       \\
       \downarrow \downarrow \downarrow \downarrow      
        \\
        K_2
       \\
       \downarrow^{\partial_0} \downarrow^{\partial_1} \downarrow^{\partial_2}
       \\
       K_1
       \\
       \downarrow^{\partial_0} \downarrow^{\partial_1}
       \\
       K_0
     }
  \right)
   \;\;\;\;\;
   \stackrel{\mathcal{O}}{\mapsto}
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow   
    \\
    \mathcal{O}(K_2)
    \\
    \uparrow^{\partial_0^*} \uparrow^{\partial_1^*} \uparrow^{\partial_2^*}
    \\
    \mathcal{O}(K_1)
    \\
    \uparrow^{\partial_0^*} \uparrow^{\partial_1^*}
    \\
    \mathcal{O}(K_0)
  }
  \right)
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \stackrel{\sim}{\leftrightarrow}
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
    \array{
     \cdots
     \\
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\sum_i (-1)^i \partial_i^*}}
     \\
     A_2
     \\
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\sum_i (-1)^i \partial_i^*}}
     \\
     A_1
     \\
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\sum_i (-1)^i \partial_i^*}}
     \\
     A_0
     \\
     \uparrow
     \\
     0
     \\
     \uparrow
     \\
     0
     \\
     \uparrow
     \\
     \vdots
   }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

On the other hand, a representable $X$ has itself a _[[simplicial T-algebra]]_ of functions, which under the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence also identifies with a cochain dg-algebra, but then necessarily in non-positive degree to match with the above convention. So we write

$$
  \mathcal{O}(X)
   \;\;\;\;\;
  =
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
   \array{
     \mathcal{O}(X)_0
     \\
     \uparrow \uparrow
     \\
     \mathcal{O}(X)_{-1}
     \\
     \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow
     \\
     \mathcal{O}(X)_{-2}
     \\
     \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow
     \\
     \vdots
   }
  \right)
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \stackrel{\sim}{\leftrightarrow}
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
    \array{
        \vdots
        \\
        \uparrow
        \\
        0
        \\
        \uparrow
        \\
        0
        \\
        \uparrow
        \\
       \mathcal{O}(X)_0
       \\
       \uparrow
       \\
       \mathcal{O}(X)_{-1}
       \\
       \uparrow
       \\
       \mathcal{O}(X)_{-2}
       \\
       \uparrow
       \\
       \vdots
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Taking this together, for $X_\bullet$ a general [[∞-stack]], its function algebra is generally an _unbounded_ cochain dg-algebra with mixed contributions as above, the simplicial degrees contributing in the positive direction, and the homological resolution degrees in the negative direction:

$$
  \mathcal{O}(X_\bullet)
   \;\;\;\;\;
   =
   \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
     \array{
        \vdots
        \\
        \uparrow
        \\
        \bigoplus_{k-p = q} \mathcal{O}(X_k)_{-p}
        \\
        \uparrow
        \\
        \vdots
        \\
        \uparrow^d
        \\
        \mathcal{O}(X_1)_0 \oplus \mathcal{O}(X_2)_{-1} \oplus 
          \mathcal{O}(X_3)_{-2} \oplus \cdots
        \\
        \uparrow^{d}
        \\
        \mathcal{O}(X_0)_0 \oplus \mathcal{O}(X_1)_{-1} \oplus 
          \mathcal{O}(X_2)_{-2} \oplus \cdots
        \\
        \uparrow^{d}
        \\
        \mathcal{O}(X_0)_{-1} \oplus \mathcal{O}(X_1)_{-2} \oplus 
          \mathcal{O}(X_2)_{-3}\oplus \cdots       
        \\
        \uparrow^{d}
        \\
        \vdots
     }
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 



### Definition


+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

For $k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0 let 

$$
  cdgAlg = CMon(Ch_\bullet(k))
$$ 

be the category of undounded commutative dg-algebras. With fibrations the degreewise surjections and weak equivalences the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s this is a 

* [[model category]]

which is

* [[proper model category|proper]];

* [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]].

=--

The existence of the model structure follows from the general discussion at [[model structure on dg-algebras over an operad]]. 

Properness and combinatoriality is discussed in ([ToënVezzosi](#ToenVezzosi)):

* in lemma 2.3.1.1 they state that $cdgAlg_+$ constitutes the first two items in a triple which they call an _HA context_ .

* this implies their assumption 1.1.0.4 which asserts properness and
  combinatoriality

Discussion of cofibrations in $dgAlg_{proj}$ is in ([Keller](#Keller)).

### Properties

#### Derived tensor product

Let $cdgAg_k$ be the projective model structure on commutative unbounded dg-algebras from above

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For cofibrant $A \in cdgAlg_k$, the functor

$$
  A\otimes_k (-) : k Mod \to A Mod
$$

preserves [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.

For $A,B \in cdgAlg_k$, their [[derived functor|derived]] [[coproduct]] in $k Mod$ coincides in the [[homotopy category]] with the derived [[tensor product]] in $k Mod$: the morphism

$$
  A \coprod_k^{L} B \stackrel{}{\to} A \otimes_k^L B
$$

is an isomorphism in $Ho(k Mod)$.

=--

This follows by the above with ([ToënVezzosi, assumption 1.1.0.4, and page 8](#ToenVezzosi)).


#### Derived hom-functor {#SimplicialHomObjects}

The model structure on unbounded dg-algebras is _almost_ $sSet_{Quillen}$-enriched. See the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+dg-algebras+over+an+operad#SimplicialEnrichment">simplicial enrichment</a> at [[model structure on dg-algebras over an operad]] for details.


+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition

Let $k$ be a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0. Let 
$\Omega^\bullet_{poly} : sSet \to (cdgAlg_k)^{op}$ be the functor that assigns polynomial [[differential forms on simplices]].

For $A,B \in dgcAlg_k$ define the [[simplicial set]]

$$
cdgAlg_k(A,B) : ([n] \mapsto Hom_{cdgAlg_k}(A, B \otimes_k \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta[n]))
  \,.
$$

This extends to a functor

$$
  cdgAlg_k(-,-) : cdgAlg_k^{op} \times cdgAlg_k \to sSet
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

The functor $cdgAlg_k(-,-)$ satisfies the dual of the [[pushout-product axiom]]: for $i : A \to B$ any cofibration in $cdgAlg_k$ and $p : X \to Y$ any fibration, the canonical morphism

$$
  (i^*, p_*) : cdgalg_k(A,B) \to 
    cdgAlg_k(A,X)
      \times_{cdgAlg_k(A,Y)} cdgAlg_k(B,Y)
$$

is a [[Kan fibration]], which is acyclic if $i$ or $p$ is.

=--

This implies in particular that for $A$ cofibrant, $cdgAlg_k(A,B)$ is a [[Kan complex]].


The proof works along the lines of ([BousfieldGugenheim, prop. 5.3](#BousfieldGugenheim)). See also the discussion at [[model structure on dg-algebras over an operad]].


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We give the proof for a special case. The general case is analogous.

We show that for $A$ cofibrant, and for any $B$ (automatically fibrant), $cdgAlg_k(A,B)$ is a [[Kan complex]].


By a standard fact in [[rational homotopy theory]] (due to [BousfieldGugenheim](#BousfieldGugenheim), discussed at [[differential forms on simplices]]) we have that $\Omega^\bullet_{poly} : sSet \to (cdgAlg^+_k)^{op}$ is a left [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen functor]], hence in particular sends acyclic cofibrations to acyclic cofibrations, hence acyclic [[monomorphism]]s of [[simplicial set]]s to acyclic fibrations of [[dg-algebra]]s. 

Specifically for each [[horn]] inclusion $\Lambda[n]_k \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ we have that the restriction map $\Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta[n]) \to \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Lambda[n]_k)$ is an acyclic fibration in $cdgAlg_k^*$, hence in $cdgAlg_k$.

A $k$-horn in $cdgAlg_k(A,B)$ is a morphism $A \to B \otimes \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Lambda[n]_k)$. A filler for this horn is a lift $\sigma$ in 

$$
  \array{
    && B \otimes \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta[n])
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& B \otimes \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Lambda[n]_k)
  }
  \,.
$$

If $A$ is cofibrant, then such a lift does always exist.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For $A \in cdgAlg$ cofibrant, $cdgAlg_k(A,B)$ is the correct [[derived hom-space]]


$$
  cdgAlg_k(A,B)
  \simeq
  \mathbb{R}Hom(A,B)   
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the assumption that $A$ is cofibrant and according to the facts discussed at [[derived hom-space]], we need to show that

$$
  s B : [n] \mapsto B\otimes_k \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta[n])
$$

is a [[simplicial resolution|resolution]], or _simplicial frame_ for $B$. (Notice that every object is fibrant in $cdgAlg_k$).

Since polynomial differential forms are acyclic on simplices (discussed [here](http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/differential+forms+on+simplices)) it follows that 

$$
  const B \to s B
$$

is degreewise a weak equivalence. It remains to show that $s A$ is fibrant in the [[Reedy model structure]] $[\Delta^{op}, cdgAlg_k]_{Reedy}$. 

One finds that the matching object is given by

$$
  (match s B)_k = B \otimes \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\partial \Delta[k])
  \,.
$$

Therefore $s B$ is Reedy fibrant if in each degree the morphism 

$$
  (s B_k \to (match s B)_k ) = (\Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\partial \Delta[k] \hookrightarrow \Delta[k]))
$$

is a fibration. But this follows from the fact that $\Omega^\bullet_{poly} : sSet \to cdgAlg_k^{op}$ is a left [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen functor]] (as discussed at [[differential forms on simplices]]).

#### Derived copowering over $sSet$ {#DerivedCopowering}

We discuss a concrete model for the $(\infty,1)$-copowering of 
$(cdgAlg_k)^\circ$ over [[∞Grpd]] in terms of an operation of $cdgAlg_k$ over [[sSet]].

First notice a basic fact about ordinary commutative algebras.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

In $CAlg_k$ the [[coproduct]] is given by the [[tensor product]] over $k$:

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    A 
      &\stackrel{i_A}{\to}& 
    A \coprod B 
      &\stackrel{i_B}{\leftarrow}& 
    B
   }
  \right)
  \simeq
  \left(
    \array{
      A 
        &\stackrel{Id_A \otimes_k e_B}{\to}& 
      A \otimes_k B 
        & \stackrel{e_A \otimes Id_B}{\leftarrow}&
      B
   }
  \right)
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We check the [[universal property]] of the coproduct: for $C \in CAlg_k$ and $f,g : A,B \to C$ two morphisms, we need to show that there is a unique morphism $(f,g) : A \otimes_k B \to C$  such that the diagram

$$
  \array{
    A 
     &\stackrel{Id_A \otimes e_B}{\to}&
    A \otimes_k B
     &\stackrel{e_A \otimes Id_B}{\leftarrow}&
    B
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(f,g)}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}} 
    \\
    && C
  }
$$

commutes.
For the left triangle to commute we need that $(f,g)$ sends elements of the form $(a,e_B)$ to $f(a)$. For the right triangle to commute we need that $(f,g)$ sends elements of the form $(e_A, b)$ to $g(b)$. Since every element of $A \otimes_k B$ is a product of two elements of this form

$$

$$

this already uniquely determines $(f,g)$ to be given on elements by the map

$$
  (a,b) \mapsto f(a) \cdot g(b)
  \,.
$$

That this is indeed an $k$-algebra homomorphism follows from the fact that $f$ and $g$ are

###### Corollary

We have that the [[copower]]ing of $A$ with the map of sets from two points to the single point

$$
  (* \coprod * \to *) \cdot A
  \simeq
  (
    A \otimes_k A
     \stackrel{\mu}{\to}
    A
  )
$$

is the product morphism on $A$. And that the tensoring with the map from the empty set to the point 

$$
  (\emptyset \to *)\cdot A
  \simeq
  (k \stackrel{e_A}{\to} A)
$$

is the unit morphism on $A$. Generally, for $f : S \to T$ any map of sets we have that the tensoring

$$
  (S \stackrel{f}{\to} T) \cdot A
  =
  A^{\otimes_k |S|}
  \to
  A^{\otimes_k |T|}
$$

is the morphism between [[tensor power]]s of $A$ of the cardinalities of $S$ and $T$, respectively, whose component over a copy of $A$ on the right corresponding to $t \in T$ is the iterated product $A^{\otimes_k |f^{-1}\{t\}|} \to A$ on as many tensor powers of $A$ as there are elements in the preimage of $t$ under $f$.

=--

The analogous statements hold true with $CAlg_k$ replaced by $cdgAlg_k$: for $S \in sSet$ and $ A \in cdgAlg_k$ we obtain a simplicial cdg-algebra 

$$
  S \cdot A \in cdgAlg_k^{\Delta^{op}}
$$ 

by the ordinary degreewise [[copower]]ing over [[Set]], using that $cdgAlg_k$ has coproducts (equal to the tensor product over $k$).

This is equivalently a commutative monoid in simplicial unbounded chain complexes

$$
  cdgAlg_k^{\Delta^{op}} \simeq CMon(Ch^\bullet(k)^{\Delta^{op}})
  \,.
$$

By the logic of the [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] the symmetric [[lax monoidal functor|lax monoidal]] [[Moore complex]] functor (via the [[Eilenberg-Zilber map]]) sends this to a commutative [[monoid]] in non-positively graded cochain complexes in unbounded cochain complexes

$$
  C^\bullet(S \cdot A) \in CMon(Ch^\bullet_-(Ch^\bullet(k)))
  \,.
$$

Since the [[total complex]] functor $Tot : Ch^\bullet(Ch^\bullet(k)) \to Ch^\bullet(k)$ is itself symmetric lax monoidal (...), this finally yields

$$
  Tot C^\bullet(S \cdot A) \in CMon(Ch^\bullet(k)) \simeq
    cdgAlg_k
$$

We have

This appears essentially (...) as ([GinotTradlerZeinalian, def 3.1.1](#GinotTradlerZeinalian)).


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[(∞,1)-limit|(∞,1)-copowering]] of $(dgcAlg_k)^\circ$ over [[∞Grpd]] is modeled by the [[derived functor]] of $CC$.

=--


This follows from ([GinotTradlerZeinalian, theorem 4.2.7](#GinotTradlerZeinalian)), which asserts that the [[derived functor]] of this tensoring is the unique [[(∞,1)-functor]], up to equivalence, satisfying the axioms of $(\infty,1)$-copowering.




+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor

$$
  CC : sSet \times cdgAlg_k \to cdgAlg_k
$$

preserves weak equivalences in both arguments.

=--

This is essentially due to ([Pirashvili](#Pirashvili)). The full statement is ([GinotTradlerZeinalian, prop. 4.2.1](#GinotTradlerZeinalian)).


+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

This means that the assumption for the copowering models of higher order [[Hochschild cohomology]] are satsified in $cdgAlg_k$ which are described in the section <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Hochschild+cohomology#PirashviliHigherOrder">Pirashvili's higher Hochschild homology</a> is satisfied:

this means that for $A \in cdgAlg$ and $S \in sSet$, $CC(S,A)$ is a model for the function $\infty$-algebra on the [[free loop space object]] of $Spec A$. See the section <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Hochschild+cohomology#OvercdgAlgs">Higher order Hochschild homology modeled on cdg-algebras</a> for more details.

#### Derived powering over $sSet$ {#DerivedPowering}


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Claim

Let $S \in \infty Grpd$ be presented by a degreewise finite [[simplicial set]] (which we denote by the same symbol).

Then the [[homotopy limit]] in $cdgAlg_k$ over the $S$-shaped diagram constant on $k$ is given by $\Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S)$.

$$
  \mathbb{R}{\lim_{\leftarrow}}_S const k \simeq \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S) 
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We show dually that for degreewise finite $S$ the assignment $(S, Spec A) \mapsto Spec (\Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S) \otimes A)$ models the $\infty$-copowering in $cdgAlg_k^{op}$.

By the discussion at <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/limit+in+a+quasi-category#Tensoring">(∞,1)-copowering</a> it is sufficient to to establish an equivalence

$$
  (dgcAlg_{k}^{op})^\circ(Spec (\Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S) \otimes A), Spec B)
  \simeq
   \infty Grpd(S, (dgcAlg_{k}^{op})^\circ(Spec A, Spec B))
$$

natural in $B$. Consider a cofibrant model of $B$, which we denote by the same symbol. The we compute with 1-categorical [[end]]/[[coend]] calculus
 
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    sSet(S, cdgAlg_k^{op}(Spec A,Spec B))
    & \simeq
    \int^{[r] \in\Delta}
      \Delta[r] \cdot Hom_{sSet}(S \times \Delta[r], 
        cdgAlg_k^{op}(Spec A, Spec B))
   \\
   & \simeq
    \int^{[r] \in\Delta}
      \Delta[r] \cdot 
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta}
       Hom_{Set}(S_k \times \Delta[k,r], 
        Hom_{cdgAlg_k^{op}}(Spec \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta^k) \times Spec A, Spec B))   
   \\
   & \simeq
    \int^{[r] \in\Delta}
      \Delta[r] \cdot 
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta} 
        Hom_{cdgAlg_k^{op}}((S_k \times \Delta[k,r]) \cdot Spec \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta^k) \times Spec A, Spec B))   
    \\
    & \simeq
    \int^{[r] \in\Delta}
      \Delta[r] \cdot 
        Hom_{cdgAlg_k^{op}}(\int^{[k] \in \Delta} 
 (S_k \times \Delta[k,r]) \cdot Spec \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta^k) \times Spec A, Spec B))       
    \\
    & \simeq
    \int^{[r] \in\Delta}
      \Delta[r] \cdot 
        Hom_{cdgAlg_k^{op}}(Spec \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S \times \Delta[r]) \times Spec A, Spec B))       
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where all steps are [[isomorphism]]s and the dot denotes the ordinary 1-categorical [[copower]]ing of the 1-category $cdgAlg^{op}$ over [[Set]]. In the last step we are using that the [[tensor product]] commutes with finite limits of dg-algebras. (This is where the finiteness assumption is needed). 

Now we use that $\Omega^\bullet_{poly}$ preserves [[product]]s up to [[quasi-isomorphism]] (as discussed <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/differential+forms+on+simplices#Properties">here</a>)

$$
  \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S \times \Delta[r])
  \simeq
  \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S) \otimes \Omega_{poly}^\bullet(\Delta[r])
  \,.
$$

This being a weak equivalence between fibrant objects and since $B$ is assumed cofibrant, we have by the [above discussion](#SimplicialHomObjects) of the derived hom-functor (and using the [[factorization lemma]]) a weak equivalence

$$
  \cdots \simeq
    \int^{[r] \in\Delta}
      \Delta[r] \cdot 
        Hom_{cdgAlg_k^{op}}(Spec \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(S) \times Spec \Omega^\bullet_{poly}\Delta[r]) \times Spec A, Spec B))       
  \,.
$$

Since all this is [[natural transformation|natural]] in $B$, this proves the claim.

For $A \in cdgAlg_k$, a [[path object]]

$$
  A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} P(A) \stackrel{fib}{\to} A \times A
$$

for $A$ is given by

$$
  P(A) := A \otimes_k \Omega^\bullet_{poly}(\Delta[1])

This follows along the above lines. The statement appears for instance as
([Behrend, lemma 1.19](#Behrend)).

#### Relation to $H \mathbb{Z}$-algebra spectra

For every [[ring spectrum]] $R$ there is the notion of [[algebra spectra]] over $R$. Let $R := H \mathbb{Z}$ be the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for the [[integer]]s. Then unbounded dg-algebras (over $\mathbb{Z}$) are one model for $H \mathbb{Z}$-algebra spectra.


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the standard [[model category]] structure for $H \mathbb{Z}$-[[algebra spectra]] and the model structure on unbounded differential graded algebras.

See [[algebra spectrum]] for details.

## Relation to $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebras

Commutative dg-algebras 
over a field $k$ of characteristic 0 constitute a presentation of 
[[E-infinity algebras]] over $k$ ([Lurie, prop. A.7.1.4.11]).
