Recall that [[cohomology]] in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ on an object $X$ with coefficients in an object $A$ is the [[hom-set]] in the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category]]

$$
  H(X,A) = \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X,A)
  \,.  
$$

This is the _cohomology set_ . 

It is a [[pointed set]] if $A$ is a [[pointed object]].

In the case that $A$ moreover carries the structure of a [[group object]], the set $H(X,A)$ inherits naturally itself the structure of a [[group]]. In this case one speaks of the _cohomology group_ of $X$ with coefficients in $A$.

Dually, is this why n-spheres are good for homotopy as they are cogroups? ---David
