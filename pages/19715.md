## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], given a [[universe in type theory|universe]], $\mathcal{U}$, we may define a type of [[mere propositions]] within that universe, $\sum_{A: \mathcal{U}} isProp(A)$. For universes, $\mathcal{U}_i$ and $\mathcal{U}_{i+1}$, we have that $A: \mathcal{U}_i$ entails $A:\mathcal{U}_{i+1}$. We thus have a natural map

$$
Prop_{\mathcal{U}_i} \to Prop_{\mathcal{U}_{i+1}}.
$$

The axiom of **proposition resizing** states that this map is an [[equivalence]]. Any mere proposition in the larger universe may be *resized* to an equivalent mere proposition in the smaller universe.

The axiom is a form of [[impredicativity]] for mere propositions, and by avoiding its use, the type theory is said to remain predicative.
