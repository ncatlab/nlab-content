## Idea

For $p \in \mathbb{R}$, $p \geq 1$, the _$p$-norm_ is a [[norm]] on suitable [[real vector spaces]] given by the $p$th [[root]] of the [[sum]] (or [[integral]]) of the $p$th-[[powers]] of the [[absolute values]] of the vector components. With due care the definition makes sense for non-[[finite dimensional vector spaces]] such as [[sequence spaces]] and [[Lebesgue spaces]], making them into [[normed vector spaces]], hence [[metric spaces]].

For $p = 2$ the $p$-norm is the standard _Euclidean norm_, defining [[Euclidean spaces]] and [[Hilbert spaces]] of [[square integrable functions]].

For $p = \infty$ the $p$-norm (found by taking the limit $p \to \infty$) is the [[supremum]] (or [[essential supremum]] in the continuous case) of the absolute values of the components of vectors, then called the _supremum norm_.

For $0 \leq p \lt 1$ one may to some extent still make sense of the formulas that define $p$-norms (see at _[Generalizations](#Generalizations)_ below), but the resulting concepts are no longer genuine norms.

### The $p$-norm on finite dimensional vector spaces
 {#ThePNorm}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \in \mathbb{R}$, $p \gt 0$, the _$p$-norm_ $\Vert - \Vert_p$ is the [[norm]] on the [[real vector space|real]] [[finite dimensional vector space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ given by the $p$th [[root]] of the [[sum]] of the $p$-[[powers]] of the [[absolute value]] of the components of a given [[vector]] $\vec x = (x)_{i = 1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^n$: 

$$ 
  {\Vert \vec x \Vert_p}  \coloneqq \root p {\sum_i {\vert x_i\vert^p}} 
$$

Equipping it with this [[norm]] makes $\mathbb{R}^n$ a  _[[normed vector space]]_.

For $p = 2$ this is the _Euclidean norm_, the standard norm that defines [[Euclidean space]].

For $p = \infty$ one takes the [[supremum]] over the [[absolute values]] of the components

$$
  {\Vert \vec x\Vert_\infty}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{1 \leq i \leq n}{\sub} {\vert x_i\vert}
  \,.
$$

### The $\mathcal{l}^p$-norm on sequence spaces
 {#OnSequenceSpaces}

For $p \in \mathbb{R}$, write $\ell^p$ for the vector space of those [[sequences]] $(x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for which the [[series]]

$$
  \underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum} {\vert x_i\vert}^p
    \;\lt\; 
  \infty
$$

(the [[sum]] of the $p$th [[powers]] of the [[absolute value]] of the components of the sequence) [[convergence|converges]].

For $p \geq 1$ the the [[function]]

$$
  {\Vert -\Vert_p}
  \;\colon\;
  \ell^p
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
  {\Vert (x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \Vert_p}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \root{p}{\underset{i \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum} {\vert x_i\vert^p}}
$$

defines a [[norm]] on this [[real vector space]]. This [[normed vector space]] is [[complete metric space|complete]], hence a [[Banach space]]. This is called the _[[sequence space]]_.

For $p = \infty$ one takes $\ell^\infty$ to be the space of bounded sequences and

$$
  {\Vert (x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \Vert_\infty}
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{sup} {\vert x_k\vert }
$$

to be the [[supremum]] over the [[absolute values]] of the components of the sequence. This is also called the _supremum norm_.


### The $L^p$-norm on Lebesgue spaces
 {#OnLebesgueSpaces}

More generally, for $(X,\mu)$ a [[measure space]], write $L^p(X)$ for the [[vector space]] of [[equivalence classes]] of those [[measurable functions]] $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$, for which the [[integral]]

$$
  \int_X {\vert f \vert^p}  d\mu \;\lt\; \infty
$$

exists, and where two such functions are regarded as equivalent, $f_1 \sim f_2$, if

$$
  \int_X {\vert f_2 - f_1 \vert^p}  d\mu \;=\; 0
  \,. 
$$

On this space the function

$$
  {\Vert -\Vert_p}
  \;\colon\;
  L^p(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
  {\Vert f \Vert_p}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \root{p}{\int_X {\vert f\vert^p}} d\mu 
$$

defines a [[norm]]. The [[triangle inequality]] holds due to [[Minkowski's inequality]].  The [[normed vector space]] $(L^p(X), {\Vert- \Vert_p})$ is also called a _[[Lebesgue space]]_.

## Generalizations for $0 \leq p \lt 1$
 {#Generalizations}

For $0 \leq p \lt 1$, the above definitions for $\Vert {-}\Vert_p$ still make sense in themselves, but the result is no longer a norm, as [[Minkowski's inequality]] (the [[triangle inequality]] for $p$-norms) fails.  A variant definition for $p \leq 1$ (which agrees with the usual definition for $p = 1$, preserving continuity in $p$) leaves out the $p$th root; then the result satisfies the triangle inequality (and indeed is a [[metric]]) but fails to be a norm because it is not positive-homogeneous of degree $1$ (but of degree $p$ instead).  Such a thing is called an [[F-norm]].

For $p = 0$, the unmodified $p$-norm (defined by the limit as $p \searrow 0$) is infinite if there is more than one nonzero entry and is the absolute value of the one nonzero entry if there is only one (or 0 if there is none); the modified $p$-norm (without the root) is the number of nonzero entries, but the triangle inequality continues to fail in this case.  Therefore, there is a further modified $0$-norm, given by
$$ {\|(x_1, x_2, \ldots)\|_0} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {2^{-n} {|x_n|}} {1 + {|x_n|}} $$
for $l^0$, which is an $F$-norm.  (But I don\'t know what is the justification for thinking of this as a $p$-norm for $p = 0$.)
