A [[topological space]] is called _fully normal_ if every [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ has a [[refinement]] by an open cover $\{V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ such that every _star_ in the latter cover is contained in a patch of the former.

Here for $x \in X$ a point, then the _star_ of $x$ is the [[union]] of the patches that contain $x$:

$$
  star(x,\mathcal{V})
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
     V_j \in \mathcal{V} \;\vert\; x \in V_J 
  \right\}
$$
