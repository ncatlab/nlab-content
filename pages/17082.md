## Idea

### Lift of morphisms

The **lift** of a morphism $p: Y\to B$ along an [[epimorphism]] (or more general map) $f:X\to B$ is a morphism $\tilde{f}: Y\to X$ such that $f = p\circ\tilde{f}$.

The dual problem is the [[extension]] of a morphism $f: A\to Y$ along a monomorphism $i: A\hookrightarrow X$, which is a morphism $\tilde{f}:X\to Y$ such that $\tilde{f}\circ i = f$. One sometimes, extends along more general morphisms than monomorphisms.
