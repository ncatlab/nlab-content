## Idea

For ordinary [[categories]] there is the notion of 

1. [[Grothendieck fibration]] between two categories. 

2. and the special case of a [[fibration fibered in groupoids]].

The analog of this for [[quasi-categories]] are

1. [[Cartesian fibration]]s

2. the special case of left/right (Kan-) [[fibrations of quasi-categories]],

rspectively. 


## Definition

A [[morphism]] of [[simplicial set]]s $f : X \to S$ is a **left fibration** or **left Kan fibration** if it has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all [[horn]] inclusions except the right outer ones. It is a **right fibration** or **right Kan fibration** if its extends against all horns except the left outer ones.


$$
  \array{
    \Lambda[n]_{k \gt 0} &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\exists}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& S
  } 
  \,.
$$

Morphisms with the [[left lifting property]] against all left/right fibrations are called **left/right anodyne** maps.

Write

$$
  RFib(S) \subset sSet/S
$$

for the full [[SSet]]-[[subcategory]] of the [[overcategory]] of [[SSet]] over $S$ on those morphisms that are right fibrations.

This is a [[Kan complex]]-enriched category and as such an incarnation of the **[[(∞,1)-category]] of right fibrations**. 
It is modeled by the [[model structure for left fibrations|model structure for right fibrations]]. For details on this see the discussion at [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]].


## Motivation: ordinary fibrations in groupoids are left fibrations

Fibrations in groupoids have a simple characterization in terms of their [[nerve]]s. Let $N : Cat \to sSet$ be the [[nerve]] functor and for $p : E \to B$ a morphism in [[Cat]], let $N(p) : N(E) \to B(N)$ be the corresponding morphism in [[sSet]].

Then

###### Proposition

The functor $p : E \to B$ is an  op-fibration in groupoids precisely if the morphism $N(p) : N(E) \to N(B)$ is a [[left Kan fibration]] of simplicial sets, i.e. precisely if for all [[horn]] inclusion 

$$
  \Lambda[n]_i \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $i$ _smaller_ than $n$ -- $0 \leq i \lt n$, we have that every commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda[n]_i &\to& N(E)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{N(p)}}
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& N(B)
  }
$$

has a lift

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda[n]_i &\to& N(E)
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{N(p)}}
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& N(B)
  }
  \,.
$$

## Properties

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Under the operation of forming the [[opposite quasi-category]], left fibrations turn into right fibrations, and vice versa: if $p : C \to D$ is a left fibration then $p^{op} : C^{op} \to D^{op}$ is a right fibration.

Therefore it is sufficient to list properties of only one type of these fib rations, that for the other follows.

#### Homotopy lifting property

In classical [[homotopy theory]], a continuous map $p : E \to B$ of [[topological spaces]] is said to have the [[homotopy lifting property]] if it has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all morphisms $Y \stackrel{(Id, 0)}{\to} Y \times I$ for $I = [0,1]$ the standard [[interval]] and every commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    Y &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y \times I &\to& B
  }
$$

there exists a lift $\sigma : Y \times I \to E$ making the two triangles

$$
  \array{
    Y &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^\sigma\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    Y \times I &\to& B
  }
$$

commute. For $Y = *$ the [[point]] this can be rephrased as saying that the 
universal morphism $E^I \to B^I \times_B E$ induced by the commuting square
commuting square

$$
  \array{
    E^I &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B^I &\to& B
  }
$$

is an [[epimorphism]]. If it is even an [[isomorphism]] then the lift $\sigma$ exists _uniquely_ . This is the situation that the following proposition generalizes:

###### Proposition

A morphism $p : X \to S$ of simplicial sets is a left fibration precisely if the canonical morphism

$$
  X^{\Delta[1]} \to X^{\{0\}} \times_{S^{\{0\}}} S^{\Delta^1}
$$

is a trivial Kan fibration.

###### Proof

This is a corollary of the characterization of left anodyne morphisms in [Properties of left anodyne maps](#PropRightAnodyne) by [[Andre Joyal]], recalled in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, corollary 2.1.2.10]].

#### As fibrations in $\infty$-groupoids

The notion of right fibration of quasi-categories generalizes the notion of [[category fibered in groupoids]]. This follows from the following properties.

###### Proposition

For $C \to *$ a right (left) fibration over the [[point]], $C$ is a [[Kan complex]], i.e. an [[∞-groupoid]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Right (left) fibrations are preserved by [[pullback]] in [[sSet]]. 

=--


+-- {: .un_corollary}
###### Corollary

It follows that the fiber $X_c$ of every right fibration $X \to C$ over every point $c \in C$, i.e. the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X_c &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \{c\} &\to& C
  }
$$

is a [[Kan complex]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ and $D$ quasi-categories that are ordinary [[categories]] (i.e. simplicial sets that are [[nerve]]s of ordinary categories), a morphism $C \to D$ is a right fibration precisely if the correspunding ordinary [[functor]] exhibits $C$ as a [[category fibered in groupoids]] over $D$.

###### Proof

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 2.1.1.3]].

=--

A canonical class of examples of a [[fibered category]] is the [[codomain fibration]]. This is actually a [[bifibration]]. For an ordinary category, a bifiber of this is just a set. For an $(\infty,1)$-category it is an $\infty$-groupoid. Hence fixing only one fiber of the bifibration should yield a fibration in $\infty$-groupoids. This is asserted by the following statement.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $p : K \to C$ be an arbitrary morphism to a [[quasi-category]] $C$ and let $C_{p/}$ be the corresponding [[over quasi-category|under quasi-category]]. Then the canonical propjection $C_{p/} \to C$ is a left fibration.

###### Proposition

The collection of left anodyne morphisms (those with [[left lifting property]] against left fibrations) is equivalently $LAn = LLP(RLP(LAn_0))$ for the following choices of $LAn_0$:

$LAn_0 =$

* the collection of all left [[horn]] inclusions

  $\{ \Lambda[n]_{i} \to \Delta[n] | 0 \leq i \lt n \}$;
