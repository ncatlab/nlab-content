## Idea 

An **ind-object** of a category $C$ is a **formal [[filtered colimit]]** of objects of $C$.  Formal means that the colimit is taken in the category of presheaves. The category of ind-objects of $C$ is written $ind$-$C$.

Here, "ind" is short for "[[inductive system]]", as in the inductive systems used to define [[directed colimits]], and as contrasted with "pro" in the dual notion of [[pro-object]] corresponding to "projective system".

Recalling the nature of [[filtered colimits]], this means that in particular chains of inclusions 

$$
  c_1 \hookrightarrow c_2 \hookrightarrow c_3 \hookrightarrow c_4 \hookrightarrow \cdots
$$

of objects in $C$ are regarded to converge to an object in $ind C$, even if that object does not exist in $C$ itself. 
Standard examples where ind-objects are relevant are categories $C$ whose objects are finite in some sense, such as finite sets or finite vector spaces. Their ind-categories contain then also the infinite versions of these objects as limits of sequences of inclusions of finite objects of ever increasing size. 

Moreover, ind-categories allow one to handle "big things in terms of small things" also in another important sense: many [[large category|large categories]] are actually ([[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to) ind-categories of [[small category|small categories]]. This means that, while [[large category|large]], they are for all practical purposes controlled by a [[small category]] (see the description of the [[hom-set]] of $ind-C$ in terms of that of $C$ below). Such [[large category|large categories]] equivalent to ind-categories are therefore called [[accessible category|accessible categories]].


## Definition 

There are several equivalent ways to define ind-objects.


### As diagrams 

One definition is to define the objects of $ind$-$C$ to be diagrams $F:D\to C$ where $D$ is a [[small category|small]] [[filtered category|filtered]] category.  
The idea is to think of these diagrams as being the placeholder for the [[colimit]] over them (possibly non-existent in $C$).
We identify an ordinary object of $C$ with the corresponding diagram $1\to C$.  To see what the morphisms should be between $F:D\to C$ and $G:E\to C$, we stipulate that

1. The embedding $C\to ind$-$C$ should be [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]],
1. each diagram $F:D\to C$ should be the colimit of itself (considered as a diagram in $ind$-$C$ via the above embedding), and
1. the objects of $C$ should be [[compact object|compact]] in $ind$-$C$.

Thus, we should have

$$
\begin{aligned}
  ind\text{-}C(F,G) &= ind\text{-}C(colim_{d\in D} F d, colim_{e\in E} G   e)\\
   &\cong lim_{d\in D}\; ind\text{-}C(F d, colim_{e\in E} G e)\\
   &\cong lim_{d\in D} colim_{e\in E}\; ind\text{-}C(F d, G e)\\
   &\cong lim_{d\in D} colim_{e\in E}\; C(F d, G e)
\end{aligned}$$

Here

* the first step is by assumption that each object is a suitable colimit;

* the second by the fact that the contravariant Hom sends colimits to limits (see properties of [[colimit]]);

* the third by the assumption that each object is a [[compact object]];

*  the last by the assumption that the embedding is a [[full and faithful functor]].

So then one _defines_ 

$$
  ind\text{-}C(F,G) \coloneqq lim_{d\in D} colim_{e\in E}\; C(F d, G e)
  \,.
$$

### As filtered colimits of representable presheaves 

Recall the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] that every presheaf $X \in PSh(C)$ is a [[colimit]] over [[representable functor|representable presheaves]]:


there is a functor $\alpha : D \to C$ (with $D$ possibly large) such that

$$
  X \simeq colim_{d \in D} Y(\alpha(d))
  \,.
$$



+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $ind\text{-}C \subset PSh(C)$ be the [[full subcategory]] of the [[presheaf]] [[category]] $PSh(C) = [C^{op},Set]$ on those [[functor]]s which are [[filtered colimits]] of [[representable functor|representables]], i.e. those for which 
$$
  X \simeq colim_{d \in D} Y(\alpha(d))
$$
with $D$ a [[filtered category]].
=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The functors $C^{op}\to Set$ belonging to $ind\text{-}C$ under this definition --- those which are filtered colimits of representables --- have an equivalent characterization as the [[flat functors]]: those which "would preserve all finite colimits if $C$ had them".  In particular, if $C$ has finite colimits, then $ind\text{-}C$ consists exactly of the finitely cocontinuous presheaves.

For more equivalent characterizations see at _[accessible category -- Definition](accessible+category#definition)_.

###### Definition

Given that $[C^{op},Set]$ is the [[free cocompletion]] of $C$, $ind$-$C$ defined in this way is its "free cocompletion under filtered colimits."

=--

To compare with the first definition, notice that indeed the formula for the [[hom-set]]s is reproduced:

Generally we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     [C^{op},Set](X,Y)
     & \simeq
     [C^{op}, Set](colim_{d \in D} Y F d, colim_{d' \in D'} Y G d)
     \\
     & \simeq 
     lim_{d \in D} [C^{op}, Set]( Y F d, colim_{d' \in D'} Y G d)
  \end{aligned}
$$

by the fact that the [[hom-functor]] sends [[colimit]]s to [[limit]]s in its first argument (see _properties_ at [[colimit]]). 

By the [[Yoneda lemma]] this is

$$
  \cdots \simeq 
   lim_{d \in D} (colim_{d' \in D'} Y G d')(F d)
  \,.
$$

Using that [[colimit]]s in $PSh(C)$ are computed objectwise (see again _properties_ at [[colimit]]) this is

$$
  \cdots \simeq 
   lim_{d \in D} colim_{d' \in D'} 
   C(F d, G d')  \,.
$$


## Examples 

* Let [[FinVect]] be the category of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]] (over some [[field]]). Let $V$ be an infinite-dimensional vector space. Then $V$ can be regarded as an object of $ind-FinVect$ as the colimit $colim_{V' \hookrightarrow V} Y(V')$ over the [[filtered category]] whose objects are inclusions $V' \hookrightarrow V$ of finite dimensional vector spaces $V'$ into $V$ of the representables $Y(V') : FinVect^{op} \to Set$ ($Y$ is the [[Yoneda embedding]]).

* For $C$ the category of finitely presented objects of some equationally defined structure, $ind\text{-}C$ is the category of all these structures.

  * The category [[Grp]] of [[group]]s is the ind-category of the category of finitely generated groups.

    * The category [[Ab]] of [[abelian group]]s is the ind-category of the category of finitely generated abelian groups.

* A [[formal scheme]] is an ind-object in [[schemes]].

## Properties 

* If $C$ is a [[locally small category]] then so is $ind-C$.

* The inclusion $C \hookrightarrow ind\text{-}C$ is [[exact functor|right exact]].

* a functor $F : C^{op} \to Set$ is in $ind\text{-}C$ (i.e. is a [[filtered colimit]] of [[representable functor|representables]]) precisely if the [[comma category]] $(Y,const_F)$ (with $Y$ the [[Yoneda embedding]]) is [[filtered category|filtered]] and [[cofinally small category|cofinally small]].

* $ind\text{-}C$ admits small [[filtered colimits]] and the inclusion $ind\text{-}C\hookrightarrow PSh(C)$ commutes with these colimits.

* If $C$ admits finite [[colimit]]s, then $ind\text{-}C$ is the [[full subcategory]] of the [[presheaf]] category $PSh(C)$ consisting of those functors $F : C^{op} \to Set$ such that $F$ is [[exact functor|left exact]] and the [[comma category]] $(Y,F)$ (with $Y$ the [[Yoneda embedding]]) is [[cofinally small category|cofinally small]].


* Ind-cocompletion is functorial -- in fact an underlying 2-functor of a [[lax-idempotent 2-monad]] (KZ-monad)

## Applications

* One important use of categories of ind-objects is in [[abelian sheaf]]-theory: for every [[small category|small]] [[abelian category]] $C$ the category $ind\text{-}C$ is a [[Grothendieck category]] and hence a good coefficient object for [[abelian sheaf cohomology]].

## In higher category theory

### In $(\infty,1)$-categories 

There is a notion of [[ind-object in an (∞,1)-category]].

With regard to the third of the properties listed above, notice that the [[comma category]] $(Y,const_F)$ is the [[category of elements]] of $F$, i.e. the [[pullback]] of the [[generalized universal bundle|universal Set-bundle]] $U : Set_* \to Set$ along $F : C^{op} \to Set$. This means that the [[stuff, structure, property|forgetful functor]]
$
  (Y,const_F) \to C
$
is the fibration classified by $F$. 

This is the starting point for the definition at [[ind-object in an (∞,1)-category]].
