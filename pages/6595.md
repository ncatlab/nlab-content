## Definition

In [[Riemannian geometry]], the **curl** or __rotation__ of a [[vector field]] $X$ over an [[orientation|oriented]] $3$-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] $(M,g)$ is the vector field $curl(X)$ (or $rot(X)$) defined by

$$
curl(X) = g^{-1}\star_g d_{dR}g(X)
,$$

where $\star_g$ is the [[Hodge star]] operator of $(M,g)$,

$$
\star_g\colon \Omega^i(M;\mathbb{R}) \to \Omega^{3-i}(M;\mathbb{R})
$$

Alternatively, the curl/rotation of a vector field $\mathcal{A}$ in some point $x\in M$ is calculated (or alternatively defined) by the integral formula 

$$
rot \vec\mathcal{A} = lim_{vol D\to 0} \frac{1}{vol D} \oint_{\partial D} \vec{n}\times \vec\mathcal{A} d S
$$

where $D$ runs over the domains with smooth boundary $\partial D$ containing point $x$ and $\vec{n}$ is the unit vector of outer normal to the surface $S$. The formula does not depend on the shape of boundaries taken in limiting process, so one can typically take a coordinate chart and balls with decreasing radius in this particular coordinate chart. 

More generally, if $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold whose [[cotangent spaces]] (equivalently, [[tangent spaces]]) are smoothly equipped with a binary [[cross product]] $&#x2a09;\colon \Omega^2(M;R) \to \Omega^1(M;R)$, then the __curl__ of any vector field $X$ is

$$
curl(X) = g^{-1} &#x2a09; d_{dR} g(X)
.$$

However, this is not as general as it may appear:

* in $0$ or $1$ [[dimension]], the cross product, hence the curl, must always be $0$;
* in $3$ dimensions, a smooth choice of cross product is equivalent to a smooth choice of [[orientation]], and we recover the previous formula;
* in $7$ dimensions, if a smooth choice of cross product is possible (as on the $7$-[[sphere]]), then uncountably many are possible, giving as many different notions of curl;
* in any other number of dimensions, no binary cross product exists at all, hence no curl.

There are also cross products of other [[arities|arity]] in other dimensions; using essentially the same formula, we can take the curl of a $k$-[[multivector|vector field]] if we have a smooth $(k+1)$-ary cross product.


## Examples

If $(M,g)$ is $\mathbb{R}^3$ endowed with the canonical Euclidean metric, then the curl of a vector field $(X^1,X^2,X^3) = X^1\partial_1 + X^2\partial_2 + X^3\partial_3$ is

$$
curl(X)^1 = \frac{\partial X^3}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial X^2}{\partial x^3} 
;\qquad
curl(X)^2 = \frac{\partial X^1}{\partial x^3}-\frac{\partial X^3}{\partial x^1} 
;\qquad
curl(X)^3 = \frac{\partial X^2}{\partial x^1}-\frac{\partial X^1}{\partial x^2} 
$$

This is the classical curl from [[vector analysis]].


## Remark

In many classical applications of the curl in [[vector analysis]], the Riemannian structure is actually irrelevant, and the gradient can be replaced with the [[exterior differential|deRham differential]] $d_{dR}$.  That is, $X$ is treated as the $1$-form $g(X)$, its curl is treated as the $2$-form $d_{dR} g(X)$, and once these identifications are made there is no need to involve $g$ at all.
