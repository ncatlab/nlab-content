## Definition

In [[Riemannian geometry]], the **curl** or __rotation__ of a [[vector field]] $X$ over an [[orientation|oriented]] $3$-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] $(M,g)$ is the vector field $curl(X)$ defined by

$$
curl(X) = g^{-1}\star_g d_{dR}g(X)
,$$

where $\star_g$ is the [[Hodge star]] operator of $(M,g)$,

$$
\star_g\colon \Omega^i(M;\mathbb{R}) \to \Omega^{3-i}(M;\mathbb{R})
$$


## Examples

If $(M,g)$ is $\mathbb{R}^3$ endowed with the canonical Euclidean metric, then the curl of a vector field $(X^1,X^2,X^3) = X^1\partial_1 + X^2\partial_2 + X^3\partial_3$ is

$$
curl(X)^1 = \frac{\partial X^3}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial X^2}{\partial x^3} 
;\qquad
curl(X)^2 = \frac{\partial X^1}{\partial x^3}-\frac{\partial X^3}{\partial x^1} 
;\qquad
curl(X)^3 = \frac{\partial X^2}{\partial x^1}-\frac{\partial X^1}{\partial x^2} 
$$

This is the classical curl from [[vector analysis]].


## Remark

In many classical applications of the curl in [[vector analysis]], the Riemannian structure is actually irrelevant, and the gradient can be replaced with the [[exterior differential|differential]].  That is, $X$ is treated as the $1$-form $g(X)$, its curl is treated as the $2$-form $d_{dR}g(X)$, and once these identifications are made there is no need to involve $g$ at all.
