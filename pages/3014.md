Classical mathematics is [[mathematics]] as it is normally practised, and particulary using commonly accepted [[foundations]].

This is a vague term, but some of the things that it might mean are:
*  use of [[classical logic]] and the [[axiom of choice]], in contrast to [[constructive mathematics]];
*  free use of [[power sets]] and [[infinite sets]], in contrast to [[predicative mathematics]] and [[finite mathematics]];
*  working in [[Set]], in contrast to working [[internalization]] to some other [[topos]] or more general [[category]];
*  allowing [[evil]] and otherwise ignoring the lessons of [[higher category theory]].

Despite the name, classical mathematics is only about 100 years old; anything much before that can usually interpreted just as well nonclassically as classically.

Note that the term 'classical' also has meanings within many specific fields of mathematics that may have nothing in particular to do with 'classical mathematics' as a whole.
