A notion of **defining sheaf of ideals** is a globalization of the notion of the [[defining ideal]] of a closed affine subvariety of an affine variety. One also says less preferrable "sheaf of definition", folowing literally the French variant. 

Given a [[closed immersion of schemes]] $f= (f,f^\sharp): (Y,O_Y)\to (X,O_X)$ of (or of more general [[locally ringed spaces]], e.g. of analytic varieties), the kernel $\mathcal{I} = O_X$ of the [[comorphism]] $f^\sharp:O_Y\to f_* O_X$ is a sheaf of ideals, called the [[defining sheaf]] of the closed immersion $f$. 

This can be repharsed in terms of the category of quasicoherenet sheaves. In this vein, [[Alexander Rosenberg]] defines the *defining ideal* of a [[topologizing subcategory]] $S$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ as the endofunctor $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{I}_S\in End(A)$ which is the subfunctor of the identity $Id_A$ assigning to any $M\in A$ the intersection of [[kernels]] $Ker(f)$ of all morphisms $f: M\to N$ with $N\in Ob(S)$.
