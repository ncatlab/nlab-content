Nekrasov functions are the coefficients of the character expansion of the matrix $\tau$-function. They were introduced in 

* N.Nekrasov, _Seiberg-Witten prepotential from instanton counting_, Adv.Theor.Math.Phys. __7__ (2004) 831-864, [hep-th/0206161](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0206161)

and play the central role in the formulation of the [[AGT conjecture]].
