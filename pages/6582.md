The basic problem of __harmonic analysis__ is the decomposition of elements in some topological vector space of functions in some basis which is typically distinguished by some nice [[representation theory|representation theoretical]] properties. This decomposition can be a sum, and a basis a topological basis, but more general it is a decomposition in the sense of an integral. The elements of the distinguished bases were in historical examples thought of as "basic waves" or "harmonics".
Some standard examples are [[Fourier analysis]] on locally compact abelian groups, [[wavelet analysis]], [[quantum group Fourier transform]] etc. In some cases the elements of the "basis" are not linearly independent, e.g. in the case of decomposition into [[coherent state]]s.
