## Idea
In 1961 G. Higman proved an important result in [[group theory]] that brings together in an intriguing way concepts from [[computability theory]] and [[finitely presentable object|finite presentability]].

## The result

**Higman's embedding theorem.** _A finitely generated group can be embedded in a finitely presented group iff it has a presentation (with a finite generating set) for which the set of defining relations is a recursively enumerable set of words._

**Theorem.** _There is a finitely presented group which contains an isomorphic copy of every finitely presented group._

## Remark

It clearly makes sense to ask the same question for other algebraic theories. In fact, it has been conjectured by the group theorist W. Boone that a similar result holds more generally for single-sorted [[Lawvere theory|algebraic theories]]. The importance of this conjecture has been stressed and the parallel to results by Craig and Vaught in [[first-order logic]] has been pointed out by [[F. W. Lawvere]] ([2002](#Lawvere02)) (see at [[Boone conjecture]] for further details).
