## Idea

The words "Chern--Simons theory" (after [[Shiing-shen Chern]] and [[James Simons]] who have their names attached to the [[Chern-Simons elements]] involved) can mean various things to various people, but here it generally refers to the three-dimensional [[TQFT|topological quantum field theory]] introduced by [[Edward Witten]] in his seminal paper ([Witten 1989](#Witten)), the paper which went a large way to him obtaining the Fields medal. 

Witten

Abstractly, Chern-Simons theory is the [[sigma-model]] [[TQFT]] whose target space is the smooth [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of a simple [[Lie group]] $G$ and whose background [[gauge field]] is the [[Chern-Simons 2-gerbe]] on $\mathbf{B}G$.

This is the [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] induced from the canonical [[Chern-Simons element]] on a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$.

For $G$ a discrete group the corresponding (much simpler) theory is [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]].



## Classical Chern-Simons theory (for simply connected groups)
 {#ClassicalChern-SimonsTheory}

For $G$ a [[simply connected]] [[Lie group]] 
we describe the basic setup of $G$-Chern-Simons theory

* [Lagrangian and action functional](#LagrangianAndActionFunctional)

* [Covariant phase space](#CovariantPhaseSpace)

### The Lagrangian and action functional
 {#LagrangianAndActionFunctional}

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] and write $\langle -,-\rangle \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ for (some multiple of) its [[Killing form]] [[invariant polynomial]] (in the [[Weil algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$).

Notice that this is in [[transgression]] via a [[Chern-Simons element]] $cs \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ to (a multiple of) the canonical [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra]] 3-cocycle

$$
  \mu_3 = \langle -,[-,-]\rangle \in CE(\mathfrak{g})
$$

in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$.

For $\Sigma$ a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] 3, write

$$
  Conf_\Sigma := \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})
   =
  \{
    \Omega^\bullet(\Sigma) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{g}) : A
  \}
$$

for the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued 1-forms]] on $\Sigma$, -- we call this the **field configuration space** of $\mathfrak{g}$-Chern-Simons theory over $\Sigma$.  Notice that this is canonically a [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoid]], as discussed there. 

By means of the above [[Chern-Simons element]] 
$W(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow W(b^2 \mathbb{R}): cs$ there is naturally associated to every field configuration $A$ a 3-form 

$$
  cs(A) \in \Omega^3(\Sigma)
$$

called the [[Chern-Simons form]] of $A$. This 3-form is the [[Lagrangian]] of Chern-Simons theory over $\Sigma$.

+-- {: .num_defn #CSActionFunctional}
###### Definition

The exponentiated **[[action functional]]** of Chern-Simons theory is the morphism

$$
 \exp(i S(-))
  : 
  Conf_\Sigma \to U(1)
$$

to the [[circle group]], which sends a field configuration $A$ to the integral over $\Sigma$ of its Chern-Simons form $CS(A)$.

$$
  A  \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma cs(A))
  \,.
$$

=--

### The covariant phase space
 {#CovariantPhaseSpace}

Since the above [[action functional]] is a [[local action functional]], its [[covariant phase space]] -- which is the space of solutions of the corresponding [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s -- naturally carries a [[presymplectic structure]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s for the action functional from def. \ref{CSActionFunctional} are

$$
  F_A = 0
  \,,
$$

where $F_A$ is the [[curvature]] 2-form of the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued 1-forms|Lie algebra valued form]] $A$.

The [[presymplectic structure]] on the space of solutions relative to any 2-[[dimensional]] submanifold $\Sigma_0 \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ is

$$
  \omega(\delta A_1, \delta A_2) \propto
  \int_{\Sigma_0} \langle \delta A_1 \wedge \delta A_2 \rangle
  \,.
$$

=--

The proof can be found spelled out at [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]].

The statements for equations of motion and gauge fixed Poisson structure appears for instance as ([Witten89, (2.3), (3,2)](#Witten)) or  ([FreedI, prop. 3.1, prop. 3.17](#Freed)). 
The [[presymplectic structure]] on the [[covariant phase space]] has apparently first been discussed in ([Witten86, section 5](#Witten86)) and in ([Zuckerman, section 3, example 2](#Zuckerman)).

Zuckerman states that on the reduced phase space of $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$-Chern-Simons theory the presymplectic form becomes the [[Weil-Petersson symplectic form]].

### Geometric quantization

Of the existing formalizations of [[quantization]], it is _[[geometric quantization]]_ that is naturally suited for the treatment of Chern-Simons theory.

For the moment, see the references [below](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Chern-Simons+theory#ReferencesGeometricQuantization).


## Classical Chern-Simons theory (general case)
 {#ClassicalChern-SimonsTheoryGeneral}

If the [[Lie group]] $G$ is not [[simply-connected]]
a $G$-[[principal bundle]] on 3-dimensional $\Sigma$
is not necessarily trivializable. (For instance for 
$G = U(1)$ the [[circle group]] the [[circle bundle]]s
on $\Sigma$ are classified by their [[Chern class]], which
can be any element in the [[integral cohomology]]
$H^2(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z})$.)

Therefore in these cases the [[configuration space]] of
Chern-Simons theory is no longer in general just a
[[groupoid of Lie algebra valued forms]] -- which is a [[groupoid]] of [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on trivial [[principal bundles]], but
a [[groupoid]] of more general [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on non-trivial [[principal bundle]]s.

The general formulation of Chern-Simons theory is then this:

let $G$ be a [[compact space|compact]] [[Lie group]] with [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $\langle-,-\rangle$
be a binary [[invariant polynomial]]. Then the refined
[[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] produces a map

$$
  \hat \mathbf{c} : H^1(\Sigma,G)_{conn} \to 
  H^4(\Sigma)_{diff}
$$

from $G$-bundles with connection to degree-4 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of $\Sigma$, classifying [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]] on $\Sigma$: the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]s.

The [[action functional]] of Chern-Simons theory is the
[[higher holonomy]] of this circle 3-bundle

$$
  S_CS : \nabla \mapsto \int_\Sigma \hat \mathbf{c}(\nabla)
  \in U(1)
  \,.
$$

### Abelian case

Let $G = U(1)$ the circle Lie group, and $\langle-,-\rangle$ the canonical invariant polynomial. 


Then the configuration space is $\mathbf{H}^2(\Sigma)_{diff}$ -- [[ordinary differential cohomology]] in degree 2 -- and the action functional is given by the [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]] over the [[Beilinson-Deligne cup product]]

$$
  S_{CS} : \hat A \mapsto \int_\Sigma \hat A \cup \hat A
  \,.
$$

(For the moment see [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] for references on this case.)



## Quantum Chern-Simons theory

### Observables: knot polynomials

The [[Wilson line]]-[[observable]]s in quantum Chern-Simons theory are
given by [[knot invariant]]s.

In [Witten (1989)](#Witten) it was shown  that the new [[knot invariant|polynomial invariant]] of [[knot]]s invented by [[Vaughan Jones]] in the context of [[von Neumann algebra]]s --  the [[Jones polynomial]] -- can be given a heuristic geometric interpretation: the [[Jones polynomial]] V(q) of a [[knot]] $K$ in a 3-manifold $M$ can be viewed as the [[path integral]] over all $SU(2)$-connections on $M$ of the exponential of the [[Chern-Simons form|Chern–Simons]] [[action functional]] $S[A]$:
\[
 V_K(q) = \int_{all\,connections\,A\,on\,M} hol_A(K) \,\, exp(iS[A])
\]
where
\[
S[A] = \frac{k}{4\pi} \int_M Tr (A \wedge dA + \frac{2}{3} A \wedge A \wedge A)
\]
is the integral of the [[Chern-Simons form|Chern–Simons Lagrangian]], 
\[
 Tr Hol_A (K) 
\]
is the trace of the holonomy of the connection around the knot $K$ in the [[fundamental representation]] of $SU(2)$, and  
\[
q = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{k+2}}.
\]
Said heuristically: the [[Jones polynomial]] of the knot $K$ can be understood as the "average value" over all connections of the _trace of the holonomy of the connection_ around the knot $K$. Note that this idea can be generalized by varying the gauge group $G$ from $SU(2)$ to some other Lie group; the representation in which the trace is evaluated can also be altered. Each of these modifications gives rise to a [[knot invariant]].  



### As an extended TQFT

The beautiful thing about Chern--Simons theory is that Witten was able use the _locality_ property of the [[path integral]] to give a _nonperturbative_ way to actually compute it. In this way Chern--Simons theory has become the 'poster-child' of [[extended topological quantum field theory]] since it exemplifies the main idea: take advantage of the higher gluing laws in order to compute geometric quantities. 

One of the major mathematical projects around Chern--Simons theory has therefore been to try and understand it rigorously as a 3-2-1-0 [[extended topological quantum field theory]]. For the abelian case the major paper in this regard is [Topological quantum field theories from Compact Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0731) by [[Dan Freed|Freed]], [[Mike Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[Jacob Lurie|Lurie]] and Teleman. No-one has yet made rigorous sense of the nonabelian theory as an extended [[TQFT]]. However, the invariants that the theory assigns to closed [[manifold]]s of dimension 0,1,2 and 3 are heuristically expected to be:

A closed 3-manifold $M$ $\mapsto$ the path integral given above (a number).

A closed 2-manifold $\Sigma$ $\mapsto$ the space of sections of the line bundle over the moduli space of flat [[connection on a bundle|connection]]s on $\Sigma$ (a finite-dimensional [[vector space]]).  (Reshetikhin and Turaev give an alternate quantum-groupy description of this space).

A circle $S^1$ $\mapsto$ the [[category]] of [[positive-energy representation]]s of the [[loop group]] $\Omega_k (G)$ at level $k$ (a [[linear category]]).

+-- {: .query}
The R-T construction sticks on the circle the [[modular tensor category]] of representations of a [[quantum group]] at a root of unity, modulo "unphysical representations."  Are these supposed to be the same?  Is this just the Kazhdan-Lusztig equivalence?

[[Urs Schreiber]]: the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] works with any [[modular tensor category]], I'd say. Using one coming from reps of loops group is expected to produce the Chern--Simonss QFT as a cobordism rep. But I think a full proof of that, i.e. a formalization of the CS path integral that would after turning the crank yield the RT construction, is not available to date. There is just lots of "circumstancial evidence".

=--

The 2-category assigned to the point is the most interesting piece of data since in principle all the other invariants can be derived from it using the gluing law. In the paper _[[Topological Quantum Field Theories from Compact Lie Groups]]_, it is proposed that

A point $\mapsto$ the category of skyscraper sheaves on ---, thought of as a 2-category via ---.

+-- {: .query}
Bruce: I've run out of time here and I can't precisely fill in those blanks above.  Any help?

[[Ben Webster]]: My understanding is that nobody is quite sure how to fill in those blanks.  One line of thinking is that it should be an object in a 3-category with is **not** 2Cat.
=--

Other groups have conceptualized this differently (but most likely equivalently at the end of the day as)

A point $\mapsto$ the 2-category of unitary [[2-representation]]s of the [[group]] $G$.

Still others think of the [[2-category]] assigned to the [[point]] in different terms.

## Properties

### Tunneling between vacua -- instanton Floer homology

For $g$ a fixed [[Riemannian metric]] on the 3-dimensional base space $\Sigma$, the [[gradient flow]] of the Chern-Simons theory [[action functional]] $S_{CS} : \Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}$ with respect to the respective [[Hodge inner product]] [[metric]] on $\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g})$ characterizes [[Yang-Mills instanton]] solutions of the [[Yang-Mills theory]] on $\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}$ with metric $g \otimes I$. 

This phenomenon is captured by [[instanton Floer homology]].

### As an effective background for topological string theory

In ([Witten94](#Witten94)) an argument was given that Chern-Simons theory can be understood as the effective target space [[string theory]] of the [[A-model]] or [[B-model]] [[TCFT]]. This argument has later been made more precise in the language of [[TCFT]]. See [TCFT -- Effective background theories](#http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/TCFT#ActionFunctionals) for more on this.

### As 3-dimensional gravity

The Chern-Simons action functional for the case that the gauge group is the [[Poincare group]] $Iso(2,1)$ (and the [[invariant polynomial]] is taken to be the one that pairs a translation generator with a rotation generator) happens to be equivalent to the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] in the [[first order formulation of gravity]] in 3-dimensions. 

Moreover, Chern-Simons theory for the groups $Iso(2,2)$ and $Iso(3,1)$ is similarly equivalent to [[gravity]] with [[cosmological constant]] in 3-dimensions.

Since the [[quantization]] of Chern-Simons theory is fairly well understood, these identifications imply indeed a definition of [[quantum gravity]] in 3-dimensions. 

More on this is at [[Chern-Simons gravity]].

Beware that there is a subtlety in the definition of the [[configuration space]]: when the field of gravity is identified with an $Iso(2,1)$-[[connection on a bundle|connection]] then the configuration space naturally contains degenerate [[vielbein]] fields $E$ (notably the 0 vielbein) and hence the induced rank-2 [[tensor]] $g = \langle E \otimes E\rangle$ may also be degenerate. Such degenerate tensors are not technically [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] tensors, since these are required to be non-degenerate. The genuine non-degenerate metric tensors correspond to precisely those $Iso(2,1)$-[[principal connection]]s which are in fact $(O(2,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(2,1))$-[[Cartan connection]]s.

However, the quantum theory exists nicely if one allows the larger configuration space of possibly degenerate metrics exists nicely, while the constrained one does not. This may be interpreted as saying that at least for purposes of [[quantum gravity]] it is wrong require non-degenerate metric tensors.


## Other features of Chern--Simons theory

There are plenty of topics not yet touched upon here.

* The idea of [[transgression]], and the significance of the [[Chern-Simons form|Chern–Simons form]]

* Large $N$ duality

* The [[BV-theory|Batalin-Vilkovisky]] viewpoint

* Much more...


### Chern--Simons theory and modular forms

Trying to interest your [[number theory]] friends with Chern--Simons theory? How about this: the Chern--Simons [[path integral]] $Z(k)$ above is (in a certain precise sense) a _[[modular form]]_. This correspondence between the Chern--Simons quantum invariants and [[modular form]]s sheds light in both directions, and is a fascinating idea to [[Bruce Bartlett|me]]. The key words here (which I don't understand) are "Eichler integral" and  "mock theta function". See:

* Lawrence and Zagier, Modular forms and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, Asian Journal of Mathematics vol 3 no 1 (1999).

* Hikami, Quantum invariant, modular forms, and lattice points, [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0409016). See also the follow ups to this paper. 

### The Morse theory of Chern--Simons theory

In a recent [talk](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2357), Witten outlined a new approach to Chern--Simons theory which perhaps gives an alternative nonperturbative definition of the [[path integral]]. Quoting from [Not Even Wrong](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2357):

> The main new idea that Witten was using was that the contributions of different critical points p (including complex ones), could be calculated by choosing   appropriate contours $\mathcal{C}_p$ using [[Morse theory]] for the Chern--Simons functional. This sort of Morse theory involving holomorphic Morse functions gets used in mathematics in [[Picard-Lefshetz theory]]. The contour is given by the downward flow from the critical point, and the flow equation turns out to be a variant of the self-duality equation that Witten had previously encountered in his work with Kapustin on [[geometric Langlands]]. One tricky aspect of all this is that the contours one needs to integrate over are sums of the $\mathcal{C}_p$ with integral coefficients and these coefficients jump at “Stokes curves” as one varies the parameter in one’s integral (in this case, $x=k/n$, $k$ and $n$ are large). In his talk, Witten showed the answer that he gets for the case of the figure-eight knot.

For slides of Witten's talk, click [here](http://www.princeton.edu/~tklose/adscft/EdwardWittenPCTS.pdf) and for video, click [here](http://echo360.princeton.edu:8080/ess/echo/presentation/2730cd4e-39b0-4d97-a825-165e7d4b819f). Pilfering material from the slides, the basic idea is as follows. Consider a general oscillatory integral in $n$ dimensions:
 \[
 I(\lambda) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} d^n exp(i\lambda f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)).
\]
We want to make sense of the integral when the function $f$ is allowed to take on imaginary values (naively, the integral diverges). To do this, we use Morse theory: we choose as our Morse function the real part of the exponent, that is $h = \Re(i \lambda f)$. For every critical point $p$ of $h$, the descending manifold $C_p$ is an $n$-cycle in the relative homology group $H_n (X, X_{\ll0})$. (Basically this means that it's a new "contour" for the integral). Moreover Morse theory tells us that the cycles we obtain in this way form a basis for the homology, so we can express our original cycle $C$ (the $\mathbb{R}^n$ appearing in the integral over $\mathbb{R}^n$) as a linear combination of these Morse theory cycles:
 \[
 C = \sum_p n_p C_p
\]
In this way we can make sense of the integral $I$ by {\em defining} it as the integral over these new cycles ("contours"): 
\[
 I(\lambda)  = \sum_{\text{crit. points} p} n_p I_p(\lambda)
\]
This new definition actually converges, and makes sense. Apparantly the same technique can be used to interpret the Chern--Simons path integral in the case of complex $k$. Witten argues that this viewpoint is useful if we try to interpret Chern--Simons theory as a theory of three-dimensional gravity, 

### Chern--Simons theory: 20 years on

The year 2009 marked the 20th anniversary of Witten's seminal paper _Quantum field theory and the Jones polynomial_ and there were a number of conferences marking this event. If anyone has notes for these conferences please say so, I ([[Bruce Bartlett|Bruce]]) would be very grateful!

* [Chern-Simons Gauge Theory: 20 years after](http://www.hausdorff-center.uni-bonn.de/event/2009/gauge_theory/) was a workshop at the Max Planck Institute in Bonn from 3--7 August 2009.
* (More here...)

### Geometric quantization and Chern--Simons theory?
In
 [Quantum field theory and the Jones polynomial](http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.cmp/1104178138), Witten makes the tantalizing observation that the "trace" occuring in the "trace of the holonomy around the knot" term in the path integral should _itself_ be seen as a path integral. In this way one hopes to obtain a much more unified formalism. See [[Bruce Bartlett:Geometric quantization and the path integral in Chern-Simons theory]] (password required).   

### Higher dimensional generalizations

One question that's been bugging me (Ben Webster) recently is what fills in the analogy "[[Jones polynomial]] is to Chern--Simons theory as [[Khovanov homology]] is to ??" 

(Urs: Answer now at [[Khovanov homology]].)

Which is to say _What 3/4-dimensional structure is Khovanov homology hinting at?_  I'm inclined to think there must be one, as it seems that all of the knot homologies associated by Chern--Simons theory to representations have categorifications (I have a [mostly finished paper](http://math.mit.edu/~bwebster/KI-HRT.pdf) on this).  Presumably these all glue together into something, possibly by a similar trick to the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction of 3-manifold invariants, but it's not so easy for me to see how.
