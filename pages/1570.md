While standard dynamics studies processes in real time, sometimes it also considers discrete dynamical systems. The step of discrete dynamics is in the appropriate category.

In __algebraic dynamics__ one typically studies discrete dynamical systems on algebraic varieties. Such a system is given by a regular endomorphism $D: X\to X$ of a variety $X$.

The case over [[number field]]s is also called arithmetic dynamics,
