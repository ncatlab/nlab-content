The **Monster group** $M$ is the largest of the sporadic finite simple groups. It has order
$$
2^{46}\cdot 3^{20}\cdot 5^9\cdot 7^6\cdot 11^2\cdot 13^3\cdot 17\cdot 19\cdot 23\cdot 29\cdot 31\cdot 41\cdot 47\cdot 59\cdot 71 = 808017424794512875886459904961710757005754368000000000
$$
and contains all but six of the other 25 [[sporadic finite simple groups]] as subquotients. One construction gives $M$ as the automorphism group of a 196884-dimensional algebra called the [[Griess algebra]].
