## Idea
A **scattered space** is a [[topological space]] that on the scale of 'connectivity' is at the extreme opposite of [[perfect space|perfect spaces]].

Scattered spaces are used to provide topological models of [[provability logic]].

## Definition

A subset $A$ of a topological space is called _dense in itself_ if  each point of $A$ is a [[limit point]] of $A$.

A topological space $X$ is called _scattered_ if $X$ doesn't contain nonempty dense-in-itself subsets.

## Example

* The [[Sierpinski space]] $X=\{a,b\}$ with topology $\{\emptyset ,\{a\}, X\}$ is scattered: whereas $b$ is a limit point of $X$, $a$ isn't, whence $X$ fails to be dense in itself. $\{a\}$ fails to be dense in itself since, whereas $b$ is a limit point, $a$ isn't. Finally, $\{b\}$ has no limit points at all. 

* Discrete spaces are scattered.

## Properties

* Every topological space $X$ is the disjoint union of a scattered subset and a [[perfect space|perfect]] subset.
