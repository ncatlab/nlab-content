## Idea
A **scattered space** is a [[topological space]] that on the scale of 'connectivity' is at the extreme opposite of [[perfect space|perfect spaces]].

Scattered spaces are used to provide topological models of [[provability logic]].

## Definition

A subset $A$ of a topological space is called _dense in itself_ if $A$ contains all its limit points.

A topological space $X$ is called _scattered_ if $X$ doesn't contain dense-in-itself subsets.

## Example

* Discrete spaces are scattered.

## Properties

* Every topological space $X$ is the disjoint union of a scattered subset and a [[perfect]] subset.
