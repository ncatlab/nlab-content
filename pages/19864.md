## Idea

As with the [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]] for [[equivariant K-theory]], similar results have been developed for [[equivariant complex cobordism cohomology theory]], and more generally for [[MU]]-modules.

For instance, for certain classes of group, $G$, the ring $MU(B G)$ is the completion of $MU_G(\ast)$ at its [[augmentation ideal]].
