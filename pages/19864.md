## Idea

As with the [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]] for [[equivariant K-theory]], similar results have been developed for [[equivariant complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([Löffler 74](#Loffler74), see [Greenlees-May, theorem 1.1](#Greenlees-May)), and more generally for [[MU]]-[[module spectrum|modules]].

For instance, for certain classes of [[groups]], $G$, the [[cohomology ring]] $MU(B G)$ is the [[completion of a ring|completion]] of $MU_G(\ast)$ at its [[augmentation ideal]].
