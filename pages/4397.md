# Bornological spaces

## Idea

Much as a [[topological structure]] on a [[set]] is a notion of which [[subsets]] are 'open', so a bornological structure, or bornology, on a set is a notion of which subsets are 'bounded'.


## Definitions

So far, we only discuss [[bornological topological vector spaces]].  See [[bornological set]] for the general notion of bornological space.

However, we can tell that bornological spaces and certain [[morphisms]] between them form a [[category]] $Born$.

## Properties

### Relation to Banach spaces
 {#RelationToBanachSpaces}

Every [[inductive limit]] of [[Banach spaces]] is bornological. ([Alpay-Salomon 13, prop. 2.3](#AlpaySalomon13))

Conversely, every bornological space is an inductive limit of [[normed spaces]], and of [[Banach spaces]] if it is quasi-complete ([Schaefer-Wolff 99](#SchaeferWolff99)).
