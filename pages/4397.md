## Idea

Much as a [[topological structure]] on a [[set]] is a notion of which [[subsets]] are 'open', so a bornological structure, or bornology, on a set is a notion of which subsets are 'bounded'.


## Definitions

So far, we only discuss [[bornological topological vector spaces]].  See [[bornological set]] for the general notion of bornological space.

However, we can tell that bornological spaces and certain [[morphisms]] between them form a [[category]] $Born$.
