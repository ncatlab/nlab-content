A computad is a formal device (due to [[Ross Street]]) for describing "generators" of $n$-[[n-category|categories]], much as [[directed graph]]s describe generators of [[category|categories]]. Originally the $n$-categories under consideration were [[strict n-category|strict]], but more recently the concept of $n$-computad has been expanded to take into account weak $n$-categories.  The notion is tied to [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] sense of higher categories, but computads can also be used as the input for [[geometric definition of higher category|geometric]] senses as well.


## Definitions ##

First we work in Street's original strict setting. 

An **n-computad** is defined recursively as follows: 

1. A 0-computad is a [[set]]; 

1. The data of an $n$-computad consists of an $(n-1)$-computad $\mathcal{C}$, a set $C_n$, and [[source]] and [[target]] maps 
$$s, t: C_n \rightrightarrows F_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})_{n-1}$$ 
where $F_{n-1}: (n-1)Comp \to (n-1)Cat$ is the "free $(n-1)$-category on an $(n-1)$-computad", and $D_j$ denotes the set of $j$-cells in a higher-dimensional category $D$. 

1. The data must satisfy globularity conditions: for all $c \in C_n$, the $(n-1)$-cells $s(c)$ and $t(c)$ must share the same source and the same target (as elements in $F_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})_{n-2}$). 

To complete the induction, we need to define $F_n$. Roughly speaking, in dimensions $j \lt n$, the structure agrees with that of $F_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})$. In dimension $n$, the $n$-cells are formal pasting diagrams built from the elements of $C_n$ by formal [[whiskering]]s and formal [[composition]]s across $(n-1)$-cells in $F_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})$. 

(Much detail to be filled in...) 


## Examples ##

* As in the definition, a 0-computad is a set.

* The free [[0-category]] on a 0-computad is just itself.

* A 1-computad is just a [[directed graph]].

* The free 1-category on a 1-computad is the usual free category on a graph.  That is, its objects are the vertices of the graph and its morphisms are finite composable strings of edges in the graph.

* A 2-computad is given by a directed graph together with a set $C_2$ of 2-cells, each equipped with a source and a target which are composable strings of edges in the graph.  For example, if the directed graph is a square
  $$\array{\bullet & \overset{f}{\to} & \bullet \\
  ^h\downarrow && \downarrow^k\\
  \bullet& \underset{g}{\to} & \bullet}$$
  then the free category it generates is the free noncommutative square, having two diagonals $k f$ and $g h$.  We can then make a 2-computad by adding one 2-cell $\alpha$ with source $k f$ and target $g h$.  The free 2-category on this 2-computad can then be drawn pictorially as
  $$\array{\bullet & \overset{f}{\to} & \bullet\\
  ^h\downarrow & \swarrow_\alpha & \downarrow^k\\
  \bullet & \underset{g}{\to} & \bullet}$$

* Any $n$-[[globular set]] can be considered as an $n$-computad where for each $n$, the functions $s, t: C_n \rightrightarrows F_{n-1}(\mathcal{C})_{n-1}$ land inside $C_{n-1}$.  The free $n$-category on this $n$-computad will then agree with the free $n$-category on the $n$-globular set we started with.

* Every [[oriental]] can be presented by a computad.


## Computads, presheaves and opetopes

The category of computads is "almost" a [[presheaf]] category.  At first glance, it may look as though it should *be* a presheaf category, say $Set^{Ctp^{op}}$ where $Ctp$ is the category of "computopes."  A "computope" is, intuitively, one possible "shape" for an $n$-cell in an $n$-category.  For example, every "globe" is a computope, as is every simplex/oriental, every cube, and so on.  It may feel at first as though a computad should be specified by giving a set of cells of each "shape" (i.e. for each computope) related by "face maps," generalizing globular sets, simplicial sets, cubical sets, and so on.

However, the presence of identities in the notion of free $n$-category prevents this from quite working, for sort of the same reason that [[strict n-categories]] are insufficient for $n\gt 2$.  For instance, there is a 2-computad with one 0-cell $x$, *no* 1-cells, and two 2-cells $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  The source and target of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must then both be the identity 1-cell $id_x$ of $x$.  Now in the free 2-category generated by this 2-computad, we have $\beta\alpha = \alpha\beta$, by the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]].  If we define a 3-computad on top of this 2-computad with a 3-cell $\mu$ whose source (say) is $\beta\alpha = \alpha\beta$, then there can be no "face" maps from the computope-shape of $\mu$ to the computope-shape of $\beta$ and $\alpha$, since there is no way to distinguish $\alpha$ from $\beta$ (i.e. neither one is the "first" or the "second").

This argument only kicks in for $n\ge 3$, so the categories of 0-computads, 1-computads, and 2-computads are presheaf categories.  (For 0 and 1, this is obvious.)

If we restrict the notion slightly, however, we can obtain presheaf categories.  For instance, if we consider only "many-to-one" computads in which the target of each $n$-cell consists of exactly one $(n-1)$-cell (rather than a free composite of such), we obtain a presheaf category, which is in fact equivalent to the category of [[opetopic sets]].
