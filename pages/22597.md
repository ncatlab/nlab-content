## Definition

A __quadratic number__ is a [[number]] that is the [[root]] of some quadratic [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] [[coefficients]]. A __quadratic irrational number__ is a __quadratic number__ that is also [[irrational number|irrational]]. The __real quadratic numbers__  are quadratic numbers without a square root of $-1$ ([[imaginary unit]]), while __complex quadratic numbers__ are quadratic numbers with a square root of $-1$. __Real quadratic irrational numbers__ are real quadratic numbers that are irrational, while __complex quadratic irrational numbers__ are complex quadratic numbers that are irrational. 

## Properties

Every quadratic irrational number $x:K$ could be expressed as 

$$x = a + b\cdot\sqrt{c}$$

where $a:\mathbb{Q}\subseteq K$, $b:\mathbb{Q}\backslash\{0\}\subseteq K$, and $c:\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}\subseteq K$, and where the [[principal square root]] $\sqrt{c}$ is not a positive integer or $i$ times a positive integer. $x$ is a real quadratic irrational number if $0\lt c$ and $x$ is a complex quadratic irrational number if $c\lt 0$. 

Every quadratic [[number field]] is a [[subfield]] of the complex quadratic numbers.
