## Idea

An _inductive type_ is a [[type]] defined as an [[initial object|initial]] [[algebra for an endofunctor]].

## Example

### Natural numbers

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[natural number]]s are the inductive type defined by

    Inductive nat : Type :=
     | zero : nat
     | succ : nat -> nat.
