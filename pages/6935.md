## Idea

An _inductive type_ it...

In terms of [[categorical semantics]], an _inductive type_ is a type whose interpretation is given by an [[initial algebra of an endofunctor]].

This has the usual meaning in ordinary [[category theory]]. In applications to [[(∞,1)-category theory]], the uniqueness clause in the notion of initial object is modified to allow for a [[contractible space]] of choices (as discussed at _[[initial object in an (∞,1)-category]]_), and this difference is reflected accordingly in the type-theoretic set-up. The [[syntax]] will give back the traditional meaning whenever equality is interpreted [[extensional type theory|extensionally]].

###### Remark

Notice that traditionally in [[category theory]], the notion of an [[initial algebra of an endofunctor|initial algebra]] $W$ [[algebra for an endofunctor|for an endofunctor]] $F$ can be broken down into three parts: 


1. It is an $F$-algebra, given by a structure $F(W) \to W$. Typically this structure is delivered in terms of _constructors_ (maps into $W$ out of the components of a coproduct decomposition of $F(W)$).

1. For any algebra $A$, there exists an algebra map $W \to A$.

1. Any two algebra maps from $W$ to $A$ are equal. 

In type theory, we break things down a bit differently, for a variety of reasons.

+-- {: .num_defn #InterpretationOfTheRules}
###### Definition

The categorical interpretation of introduction, elimination and computation rule are the following.

1. **introduction rule** 

   The interpretation of inductive term introduction is by a morphism

   $$
     F(W) \to W
   $$


1. **elimination rule** 

   Given a [[display map]] (e.g., a [[fibration]]) $B \to W$, where $B$ is given an algebra structure and the display map is an algebra map, the (dependent) eliminator is interpreted as a specified [[section]] $\sigma : W \to B \in \mathcal{C}_{/W}$

   $$
     \array{
       W &&\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&& B
       \\
        & {}_{\mathllap{id}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{}}
       \\
       && W
     }
   $$

1. **computation rule** 

   That section $\sigma$ is required to be an [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] [[homomorphism]].

+-- {: .num_remark #EliminationInterpretationImpliesMapsOut}
###### Remark

For the special case that $B \to W$ is a [[projection]] $p_1 : W \times A \to W$, the elimination and comutation rule imply in particular a specified algebra homomorphism from $W$ to any other $F$-algebra $A$.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Observation

When interpreted in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of [[homotopy type|homotopy 0-types]] = sets,
definition \ref{InterpretationOfTheRules}
implies that $W$ is an [[initial algebra for an endofunctor|initial algebra]] for $F$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By remark \ref{EliminationInterpretationImpliesMapsOut} we have a homomorphism from $W$ to any other $F$-algebra $A$. Therefore it remains to show that for $f, g : W \to A$ two algebra homomorphism, they are necessarily equal.

To that end, notice that by the assumption of 0-truncation, the [[diagonal]]  $\delta \colon A \to A \times A$ is a display map / fibration. 

Form its [[pullback]] $P$ 

$$
  \array{
    P & \to & A 
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{\delta} 
    \\
    W & \underset{\langle f, g \rangle}{\to} & A \times A,
  }
  \,,
$$ 

which is also an algebra homomorphism. Therefore by the interpretation of the elimination rule has a (specified) [[section]]. $\sigma : W \to P$. But $P \to W$ is the pullback of a [[monomorphism]] and therefore itself a monomorphism, and so the section forces it to be in fact an [[isomorphism]]. This in turn means that $f$ and $g$ are equal.

###### Remark

Notice that this is the [[induction]] principle (subalgebras of an initial algebra are the whole initial algebra). 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In [[intensional type theory]], where the diagonal is not a display map, we can perform the same argument using a [[path object]] $P A \to A \times A$ (represented in type theory by an [[identity type]]), showing thereby that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic.  A fancier version of this argument enables us to show that the space of algebra maps $W\to A$ is actually contractible. In other words, the axioms for an inductive type still imply that algebra maps out of $W$ are essentially unique, even though the axioms do not state this explicitly.

## Properties

### Homotopy initiality

Any inductive type $W$ is a homotopy initial F-[[algebra over an endofunctor|algebra]]: 
the space
of $F$-[[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] maps $W \to X$ is 
[[contractible]].

([Awodey-Gambino-Sojakova](#AwodeyGambinoSojakova))

## Examples

### Natural numbers

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[natural numbers]] are the inductive type defined by

    Inductive nat : Type :=
     | zero : nat
     | succ : nat -> nat.

This is the initial algebra for the endofunctor $F(X) = 1 + X = * \coprod X$.

### Identity types

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[identity types]] are the inductive types (or more precisely, the inductive *family*) defined by

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := 
      idpath : forall x, id x x.

This is the "initial algebra" for the endofunctor of the [[slice category]] over $A\times A$ which is constant at the [[diagonal]] $A\to A\times A$.
