## Idea

An _inductive type_ is...

In terms of [[categorical semantics]], an _inductive type_ is a type whose interpretation is given by an [[initial algebra of an endofunctor]].

This has the usual meaning in ordinary [[category theory]]. In applications to [[(∞,1)-category theory]], the uniqueness clause in the notion of initial object is modified to allow for a [[contractible space]] of choices (as discussed at _[[initial object in an (∞,1)-category]]_), and this difference is reflected accordingly in the type-theoretic set-up. The [[syntax]] will give back the traditional meaning whenever equality is interpreted [[extensional type theory|extensionally]].

## Definition

There are two _equivalent_ ways of defining the [[judgement]] rules for inductive types. The first describes [[term elimination|elimination]] on [[dependent types]] over the given type. This is the formalization of the notion of [[induction]], and discussed below in 

* [Induction: dependent elimination, computation](#InductionRules).

The second describes [[term elimination|elimination]] on absolute types. This is the formalization of the notion of [[recursion]], and discussed below

* [Recursion: elimination, computation](#RecursionRules)

###### Definition

The categorical interpretation of [[induction]], hence of the _dependent elimination_ and computation rules from [above](#InductionRules) are the following. 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the ambient [[category]].

1. **[[term introduction rule]]** 

   The interpretation of inductive term introduction is by an [[endofunctor]] $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ and an [[algebra over an endofunctor]], exhibited by a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

   $$
     F(W) \to W
     \,.
   $$


1. **[[term elimination rule]]** 

   The interpretation of the dependent elimination rule says that given a [[display map]] $B \to W$, where $B$ is given an $F$-[[algebra over an endofunctor|algebra structure]] and the display map is an $F$-algebra [[homomorphism]], the dependent eliminator is interpreted as a specified [[section]] $\sigma : W \to B \in \mathcal{C}_{/W}$, hence as a [[diagram]]

   $$
     \array{
       W &&\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&& B
       \\
        & {}_{\mathllap{id}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{}}
       \\
       && W
     }
   $$

   in $\mathcal{C}$.

1. **[[computation rule]]** 

   The interpretation of the dependent computation rules is that the section $\sigma$ from above is required to be an [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] [[homomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #InterpretationOfTheSimpleRules}
###### Definition

The categorical interpretation of [[recursion]], hence of the absolute elimination rules from [above](#RecursionRules) in a suitable [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is the following

1. **[[term introduction rule]]** 

   The interpretation of inductive term introduction is by an [[endofunctor]] $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ and an [[algebra over an endofunctor]], exhibited by a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

   $$
     F(W) \to W
     \,.
   $$

1. **[[term elimination rule]]**

   The interpretation of the absolute elimination rule is that for $A$ any other $F$-[[algebra of an endofunctor|algebra]], there is a morphism $W \to A$ in $\mathcal{C}$.

1. **[[computation rule]]**

   The interpretation of the absolute computation rule says that the morphism $W \to A$ from above is an algebra [[homomorphism]] and is unique as such.

In summary this says that the recursion rules are interpretd as an [[initial algebra of an endofunctor]].

+-- {: .num_prop #BothFormulationsOfInitialityAreEquivalent}
###### Proposition

When interpreted in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of [[homotopy type|homotopy 0-types]] = sets,
definition \ref{InterpretationOfTheRules}
and
definition \ref{InterpretationOfTheSimpleRules}
are indeed equivalent.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First suppose that $W$ is an initial $F$-algebra as in def. \ref{InterpretationOfTheSimpleRules}. Then since [[initial object|initiality]] entails first of all the existence of a morphims to any other object it follows that with $B$ another $F$-algebra there is a homomorphism $W \to B$, and since secondly initiality entails uniqueness of this morphism, it follows that given a homomorphism $B \to W$ the composite $W \to B \to W$ has to equal the identity $id_W$, hence that $B \to W$ has a section, and uniquely so.

Conversely, assume that $W$ satisfies definition \ref{InterpretationOfTheRules}.
For $A$ any other $F$-algebra we can form the trivial display map $W \times A \to W$ by [[projection]] and a [[section]] of this is equivalently just a morphism $W \to A$,  so we have a homomorphism from $W$ to any other $F$-algebra $A$. Therefore to show that $W$ is an initial $F$-algebra it remains to show that for $f, g : W \to A$ two algebra homomorphism, they are necessarily equal.

To that end, notice that by the assumption of 0-truncation, the [[diagonal]]  $\delta \colon A \to A \times A$ is a display map / fibration. 

Form its [[pullback]] $P$ 

$$
  \array{
    P & \to & A 
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{\delta} 
    \\
    W & \underset{\langle f, g \rangle}{\to} & A \times A,
  }
  \,,
$$ 

which is also an algebra homomorphism. Therefore by the interpretation of the elimination rule it has a (specified) [[section]] $\sigma : W \to P$. But $P \to W$ is the pullback of a [[monomorphism]] and therefore itself a monomorphism, and so the section forces it to be in fact an [[isomorphism]]. This in turn means that $f$ and $g$ are equal. 

=--


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In [[intensional type theory]], where the diagonal is not a display map, we can perform the same argument using a [[path object]] $P A \to A \times A$ (represented in type theory by an [[identity type]]), showing thereby that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic.  A fancier version of this argument enables us to show that the space of algebra maps $W\to A$ is actually contractible. In other words, the axioms for an inductive type still imply that algebra maps out of $W$ are essentially unique, even though the axioms do not state this explicitly.

## Properties

### Homotopy initiality

Any inductive type $W$ is a homotopy initial F-[[algebra over an endofunctor|algebra]]: 
the space
of $F$-[[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] maps $W \to X$ is 
[[contractible]].

### Natural numbers
 {#NaturalNumbers}

#### Introduction, elimination, computation

+-- {: .num_defn #InterpretationOfTheRules}
###### Definition

The [[type of natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ is the inductive type defined as follows.

1. **[[term introduction rule]]**

   $$
     \frac{}{0 \in \mathbb{N}}
     \;\;
     \frac{n \in \mathbb{N}}{s(n) \in \mathbb{N}}
   $$

1. **[[term elimination rule]]**

   $$
     \frac{
        \left(
        x \in \mathbb{N} \vdash  P(x) : Type
        \;\;
        \vdash p_0 : P(0)
        \;\;\;
        x \in \mathbb{N}, p : P(x) \vdash q : P(s x)
       \right)
       \;\;
       \vdash n \in \mathbb{N}
     }{
       p(n) : P(n)
     }
   $$

   (check, this probably still has syntax errors...)
   
1. **[[computation rule]]**

   (...)

=--

See for instance ([Pfenning, section 2](#Pfenning)).

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[natural numbers]] are the inductive type defined by

    Inductive nat : Type :=
     | zero : nat
     | succ : nat -> nat.

In the [[categorical semantics]]
this is interpreted as the [[initial algebra for an endofunctor|initial algebra]] for the endofunctor $F$ that sends an object to its [[coproduct]] with the [[terminal object]] 

$$
  F(X) = * \coprod X
  \,,
$$

or in different equivalent notation, which is very suggestive here:

$$
  F(X) = 1 + X
  \,.
$$

That [[initial algebra for an endofunctor|initial algebra]] is (as explained there) precisely a [[natural number object]] $\mathbb{N}$. The two components of the morphism $F(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N}$ that defines the algebra structure are the 0-[[generalized element|element]] $zero : * \to \mathbb{N}$ and the successor [[endomorphism]] $successor : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$

$$
  (zero,successor) : * \coprod \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}
  \,.
$$

In the following we write of course for short $0 : * \to \mathbb{N}$ and $s : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$.

#### Induction

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

We spell out in detail how the fact that $\mathbb{N}$ satisfied def. \ref{InterpretationOfTheRules} is the classical [[induction principle]]. 

That principle says informally that if a [[proposition]] $P$ depending on the natural numbers is true at $n = 0$ and such that if it is true for some $n$ then it is true for $n+1$, then it is true for all natural numbers.
 
Here is how this is formalized in type theory and then [[categorical semantics|interpreted]] in some suitable ambient category $\mathcal{C}$.

First of all, that $P$ is a proposition depending on the natural numbers means that it is a [[dependent type]]

$$
  n \in \mathbb{N} \vdash P(n) : Type
  \,.
$$ 

The categorical interpretation of this is by a [[display map]]

$$
  \array{
     P 
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{N}
  }
$$

in the given category $\mathcal{C}$.

Next, the fact that $P$ holds at 0 means that there is a ([[proof]]-)[[term]]

$$
  \vdash p_0 \in P(0)
  \,.
$$

In the categorical semantics the [[substitution]] of $n$ for 0 that gives $P(0)$ is given by the [[pullback]] of the above fibration

$$
  \array{
    0^* P &\to& P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{0}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
  }
$$

and the [[term]] $p_0$ is interpreted as a [[section]] of the resultig fibration over the terminal object

$$
  \array{
    * &\stackrel{p_0}{\to}& 0^* P &\to& P
    \\
    &\searrow& \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && * &\stackrel{0}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
  }
  \,.
$$

But by the defining [[universal property]] of the pullback, this is equivalently just a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    * &\stackrel{p_0}{\to}& P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{0}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
  }
  \,.
$$

Next the induction step. Formally it says that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an [[implication]] $p_s(n) : P(n) \to P(n+1)$

$$
  n \in \mathbb{N} \vdash p_s(n)  : P(n) \to   P(n+1)
$$

The categorical semantics of the [[substitution]] of $n+1$ for $n$ is now given by the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     P((-)+1) \coloneqq & s^*P &\to& P
     \\
     & \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     & \mathbb{N} &\stackrel{s}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
  }
$$

and the interpretation of the implication term $p_s(n)$ is as a morphism $P \to s^* P$ in $\mathcal{C}_{/\mathbb{N}}$

$$
  \array{
     P & \stackrel{p_s}{\to} &  s^*P &\to& P
     \\
     &\searrow & \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     && \mathbb{N} &\stackrel{s}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
  }
  \,.
$$

Again by the [[universal property]] of the pullback this is the same as a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     P &\stackrel{p_s}{\to}& P
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     \mathbb{N} &\stackrel{s}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
  }
  \,.
$$

In summary this shows that the fact that $P$ is a proposition depending on natural numbers which holds at 0 and which holds at $n+1$ if it holds at $n$ is interpreted precisely as an $F$-[[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra homomorphism]]

$$
  \array{
     P
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{N}
  }
  \,.
$$

The [[induction principle]] is supposed to deduce from this that $P$ holds for every $n$, hence that there is a proof $p_n : P(n)$ for all $n$:

$$
  n \in \mathbb{N} \vdash p(n) : P(n)
  \,.
$$

The categorical interpretation of this is as a morphism $p : \mathbb{N} \to P$ in $\mathcal{C}_{/\mathbb{N}}$. The existence of this is indeed exactly what the interpretation of the elimination rule, def. \ref{InterpretationOfTheRules}, gives, or (equivalently by prop. \ref{BothFormulationsOfInitialityAreEquivalent}) exactly what the initiality of the $F$-algebra $\mathbb{N}$ gives.

=--


#### Recursion

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

We spell out how the fact that $\mathbb{N}$ satisfies def. \ref{InterpretationOfTheSimpleRules} is the classical [[recursion principle]]. 


So let $A$ be an $F$-algebra object, hence equipped with a morphism

$$
  a_0 : * \to A
$$

and a morphism

$$
  h : A \to A
  \,.
$$

By [[initial object|initiality]] of the $F$-algebra $\mathbb{N}$, there is then a (unique) morphism

$$
  f : \mathbb{N} \to A
$$

such that the diagram 

$$
  \array{
    * &\stackrel{0}{\to}& \mathbb{N} &\stackrel{(-)+1}{\to}& \mathbb{N}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    * &\stackrel{a_0}{\to}& A &\stackrel{h}{\to}& A
  }
$$

commutes. This means precisely that $f$ is the function defined recursively by

1. $f(0) = a_0$;

1. $f(n+1) = h(f(n))$.

=--


### Identity types
 {#IdentityTypes}

The introduction, elimination and computation rules for _[[identity types]]_ are discussed there.

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[identity types]] are the inductive types (or more precisely, the _[[inductive family]]_) defined by

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := 
      idpath : forall x, id x x.

#### Categorical semantics

We may [[categorical semantics|interpret]] identity types in suitable categories $\mathcal{C}$ such as a [[type-theoretic model category]].

+-- {: .num_example #EndofunctorForIdentityTypes}
###### Example

The [[categorical semantics|categorical interpretation]] of identity types in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is as  the [[initial algebra of an endofunctor|initial algebra]] for the [[endofunctor]] 

$$
  F : \mathcal{C}_{/A \times A} \to 
  \mathcal{C}_{/A \times A}
$$

of the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/A \times A}$ over $A\times A$ which is constant at the [[diagonal]] $A\to A\times A$:

$$
  F (\langle E \to A \times A\rangle) = \langle A \stackrel{\Delta}{\to} A \times A\rangle
  \,.
$$

=--

So an [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] for this endofunctor is a morphism

$$
  \array{
    A &&\to&& E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\Delta}}\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && A \times A
  }
$$

and the [[initial object|initial]] such is the [[path space object]] $A^I \to A \times A$.

#### Path induction
 {#PathInduction}


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

We spell out in detail how the the [[induction principle]] def. \ref{InterpretationOfTheRules} for identity types is the [[principle of substitution of equals for equals]].

To have an $F$-algebra $\langle E \to A\times A\rangle$ over $\langle A^I \to A \times A\rangle$ means precisely to have a diagram

$$
  \array{
    && E 
    \\
    & \nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& A^I
    \\
    &\searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && A \times A
  }
$$
 
in $\mathcal{C}$.

This is the interpretation of the elimination rule: $E \to A^I$ is the interpretation of a type 

$$
  a,b \in A , p : (a = b) \vdash E(a,b,p)
$$

and the lift $A \to E$ is a [[section]] of the [[pullback]] of $E$ to $A$, hence an interpretation of a [[term]] in the [[substitution]]

$$
  s : E(a,a,r_a)
  \,.
$$

The elimination rule then says that this extends to a section $A^I \to E$, hence a "proof of $E$ over all identifications" $a = b$.

=--

#### Path recursion
 {#PathRecursion}

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

We spell out how the the [[recursion principle]] def. \ref{InterpretationOfTheSimpleRules} for [[identity types]] is related to the _[[complete Segal space|Segal-completeness condition]]_ and in particular to _[[univalence]]_. 

Notice that an [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra over the endofunctor]] that defines identity types, example \ref{EndofunctorForIdentityTypes},

$$
  \array{
     X_0 &&\stackrel{\sigma_0}{\to}&& X_1
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\delta_0, \delta_1}}
     \\
     && X_0 \times X_0
  }
$$

constitutes the [[simplicial skeleton|1-skeleton]] of a [[simplicial object]]

$$
  \array{
     X_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\downarrow \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_0}} \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\delta_1}}
     \\   
     X_0
  }
  \,.
$$

The [[recursion principle]] says that the [[simplicial identities|degeneracy map]] $\sigma_0$ factors through the [[path space object]] of $X_0$ as a lift $\hat \sigma_0$ in the diagram

$$
  \array{
     X_0 &\stackrel{\sigma_0}{\to}& X_1
     \\
     \downarrow &\nearrow_{\hat \sigma_0}& \downarrow
     \\
     X_0^I &\to& X_0 \times X_0
  }
  \,.
$$

[[categorical semantics|Semantically]], this lift exists because $X_0 \to X_0^I$ is an [[acyclic cofibration]] by definition of [[path space object]], and $X_1 \to X_0 \times X_0$ is a [[fibration]] ([[display map]]) by the interpretation rule for [[dependent types]].

This morphism 

$$
  \hat \sigma_0 : X_0^I \to X_1
$$

lifts paths/[[morphisms]] that exist in $X_0$ to the morphisms exhibited by $X_1$, if we think of the above as the 1-skeleton of a simplicial object that represents an [[internal category in an (infinity,1)-category]].

Suppose this exists, then there will be a notion of _equivalences_ in $X_1$, those morphisms that are invertible with respect to the given composition operation. In good situations this will give the [[core]] inclusion

$$
  Core(X_1) \hookrightarrow X_1
  \,.
$$

In this case the [[complete Segal space|Segal-completeness condition]] in degree 1 says that the path recursion $\hat \sigma_0$ exhibits this inclusion

$$
  \hat \sigma_0 : X_0^I \simeq Core(X_1) \to X_1
  \,.
$$

In the case that $X_\bullet$ is the classifier of the [[codomain fibration]], then this is called the _[[univalence]]-condition_.
