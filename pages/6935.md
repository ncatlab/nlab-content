## Idea

An _inductive type_ is a [[type]] defined as an [[initial object|initial]] [[algebra for an endofunctor]].

This has the usual meaning in ordinary [[category theory]]. In applications to [[(∞,1)-category theory]], the uniqueness clause in the notion of initial object is modified to allow for a [[contractible space]] of choices (as discussed at _[[initial object in an (∞,1)-category]]_), and this difference is reflected accordingly in the type-theoretic set-up. The [[syntax]] will give back the traditional meaning whenever equality is interpreted [[extensional type theory|extensionally]].

## Explanation 

In ordinary [[category theory]], the notion of an initial algebra $W$ [[algebra for an endofunctor|for an endofunctor]] $F$ can be broken down into three parts: 

1. It is an $F$-algebra, given by a structure $F(W) \to W$. Typically this structure is delivered in terms of _constructors_ (maps into $W$ out of the components of a coproduct decomposition of $F(W)$).

1. For any algebra $A$, there exists an algebra map $W \to A$.

1. Any two algebra maps from $W$ to $A$ are equal. 

In type theory, we break things down a bit differently, for a variety of reasons.  In terms of the [[categorical semantics|categorical interpretations]] of [[dependent type theory]], what the structure of an inductive type gives us is the following.

1. An algebra structure $W$, prescribed by constructors.

1. For any algebra $A$, a _specified_ algebra map $W \to A$.

1. Given a [[display map]] (e.g., a [[fibration]]) $B \to W$, where $B$ is given an algebra structure and the display map is an algebra map, one has a specified [[section]] $W \to B$ that is also an algebra map.

In fact, the second piece of structure is obtained as the special case of the third where $B = W\times A$ and the display map is the evident projection.  We refer to the specified section as the (dependent) *eliminator*, and to the fact that it is an algebra map as its *computation rule*.

Notice that these axioms still imply that algebra maps out of $W$ are essentially unique, even though that is not stated explicitly. For suppose that we assume that the [[diagonal]] map $\delta \colon A \to A \times A$ is a display map or fibration (as in the world of [[homotopy type|homotopy 0-types]] = sets), and suppose $f$ and $g$ are algebra maps from $W$ to $A$. We pull back to a display map over $W$,

$$\array{
P & \to & A \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{\delta} \\
W & \underset{\langle f, g \rangle}{\to} & A \times A,
}$$ 

and this $P \to W$ is also an algebra map. Therefore it has a (specified) section. But since $P \to W$ is also monic, the section forces it to be an [[isomorphism]], whence $f$ and $g$ are equal as required.

Notice that this is the [[induction]] principle (subalgebras of an initial algebra are the whole initial algebra). 

In [[intensional type theory]], where the diagonal is not a display map, we can perform the same argument using a [[path object]] $P A \to A \times A$ (represented in type theory by an [[identity type]]), showing thereby that $f$ and $g$ are homotopic.  A fancier version of this argument enables us to show that the space of algebra maps $W\to A$ is actually contractible.


## Type-theoretic definition 

To be written. Presumably there are introduction, elimination, and computation rules. 

## Examples

### Natural numbers

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[natural numbers]] are the inductive type defined by

    Inductive nat : Type :=
     | zero : nat
     | succ : nat -> nat.

This is the initial algebra for the endofunctor $F(X) = 1 + X$.

### Identity types

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[identity types]] are the inductive types (or more precisely, the inductive *family*) defined by

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := 
      idpath : forall x, id x x.

This is the "initial algebra" for the endofunctor of the [[slice category]] over $A\times A$ which is constant at the [[diagonal]] $A\to A\times A$.
