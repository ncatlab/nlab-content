## Idea

An _inductive type_ is a [[type]] defined as an [[initial object|initial]] [[algebra for an endofunctor]].

## Examples

### Natural numbers

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[natural numbers]] are the inductive type defined by

    Inductive nat : Type :=
     | zero : nat
     | succ : nat -> nat.

### Identity types

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[identity types]] are the inductive types defined by

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := 
      idpath : forall x, id x x.
