## Idea

An _inductive type_ is a [[type]] defined as an [[initial object|initial]] [[algebra for an endofunctor]]. 

This has the usual meaning in ordinary category theory. In applications to $(\infty, 1)$-category theory, the uniqueness clause in the notion of initial object is modified to allow for a contractible space of choices, and this difference is reflected accordingly in the type-theoretic set-up. The syntax will give back the traditional meaning whenever equality is interpreted extensionally. 

## Explanation 

In ordinary category theory, the notion of an initial algebra $W$ for an endofunctor $F$ can be broken down into three parts: 

1. It is an $F$-algebra, given by a structure $F(W) \to W$. Typically this structure is delivered in terms of _constructors_. 

1. For any algebra $A$, there exists an algebra map $W \to A$. 

1. Any two algebra maps from $W$ to $A$ are equal. 

In categorical interpretations of dependent type theory, particularly where equality predicates are not interpreted as monos $\delta \colon X \to X \times X$ (as in homotopy type theory), one has instead: 

1. An algebra structure $W$, prescribed by constructors. 

1. For any algebra $A$, a _specified_ algebra map $W \to A$. 

1. Given a display map (e.g., a fibration) $A \to W$, where $A$ is given an algebra structure and the display map is an algebra map, one has a specified section $W \to A$ that is also an algebra map. 

As a reality check, suppose that we assume that the diagonal map $\delta \colon A \to A \times A$ is a display map or fibration (as in the world of homotopy 0-types = sets), and suppose $f$ and $g$ are algebra maps from $W$ to $A$. We pull back to a display map over $W$,

$$\array{
P & \to & A \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{\delta} \\
W & \underset{\langle f, g \rangle}{\to} & A \times A,
}$$ 

and this $P \to W$ is also an algebra map. Therefore it has a (specified) section. But since $P \to W$ is also monic, the section forces it to be an isomorphism, whence $f$ and $g$ are equal as required. Notice that this is the induction principle (subalgebras of an initial algebra are the whole initial algebra). 

## Type-theoretic definition 

To be written. Presumably there are introduction, elimination, and computation rules. 

## Examples

### Natural numbers

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[natural numbers]] are the inductive type defined by

    Inductive nat : Type :=
     | zero : nat
     | succ : nat -> nat.

### Identity types

In [[Coq]]-[[syntax]] the [[identity types]] are the inductive types defined by

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := 
      idpath : forall x, id x x.
