## Motivation

Once, [[Johan Alm]] wrote some very neat notes:

* [Quantization as a Kan Extension](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Kantization09May27.pdf)

A discussion is available at the [$n$Café](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/05/alm_on_quantization_as_a_kan_e.html). The paper proves an aspect of the "[$n$-Café Quantum Conjecture](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/06/the_ncaf_quantum_conjecture.html)", suggested by [[Urs Schreiber]]. There is some old discussion at previous versions of the page [[Quantization as a Kan Extension]], and some on-page discussion that is now stored [at the nForum](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/12529/an-exercise-in-kantization/?Focus=90941#Comment_90941).

## Further work

Discussion of quantization in terms of Kan extension and [[pushforward in generalized cohomology]] is now at _[[motivic quantization]]_, with notes being at _[[schreiber:master thesis Nuiten]]_ and _[[schreiber:Quantization via Linear homotopy types]]_ .
