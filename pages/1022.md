
"Projective limit" is another term for what here is simply called [[colimit]].  (Similarly, "[[inductive limit]]" is another term for what here is called [[limit]].)

Many authors restrict this term to colimits over upward-[[directed sets]] (or [[filtered categories]]), especially the directed set $(\mathbb{N}, \leq)$ of [[natural numbers]]; see [[directed colimit]] (or [[filtered colimit]]) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.
