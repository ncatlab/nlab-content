## Idea

Generally, a __projective limit__ is the same thing as a [[limit]].  (Similarly, an [[inductive limit]] is the same thing as a [[colimit]].)  In this context, a __projective system__ is the same thing as a [[diagram]], and a __projective cone__ is the same thing as a [[cone]].

However, many authors restrict this terminology to limits over [[codirected sets]] (or [[cofiltered categories]]), especially the codirected set $(\mathbb{N},\geq)$ of [[natural numbers]]; see [[codirected limit]] (or [[cofiltered limit]]) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.

The dual concept is _[[inductive limit]]_.
