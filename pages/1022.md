"Projective limit" is another term for what here is simply called [[limit]].  (Similarly, "[[inductive limit]]" is another term for what here is called [[colimit]].)

Many authors restrict this term to limits over [[codirected sets]] (or [[cofiltered categories]]), especially the codirected set $(\mathbb{N}, \geq)$ of [[natural numbers]]; see [[codirected limit]] (or [[cofiltered limit]]) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.
