## Idea

A _monoidal functor_ is a [[functor]] between [[monoidal categories]] that preserves the monoidal structure: a [[homomorphism]] of monoidal categories.

## Definition ##

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ between [[strict monoidal category|strict]] [[monoidal categories]] $(C,\otimes)$ and $(D,\otimes)$ is called **lax monoidal** if it is equipped with a morphism

$$
  \epsilon : I_D \stackrel{}{\to} F(I_C)  
$$

and a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \mu_{x,y} : F(x) \otimes_D F(y) \to F(x \otimes_C y)
$$

satisfying the following conditions

* **[[associativity]]** For all $x,y,z \in C$ we have a [[commuting diagram]]

  $$
    \array{
      F(x) \otimes F(y) \otimes F(z) &\stackrel{Id \otimes \mu_{y,z}}{\to}&
      F(x) \otimes F(y \otimes z)
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{\mu_{x,y} \otimes Id}}\downarrow
      && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{x,y \otimes z}}}
      \\
      F(x \otimes y) \otimes F(z)
      &\stackrel{\mu_{x \otimes y, z}}{\to}&
      F(x \otimes y \otimes z)
    }
  $$

* **[[unitality]]** For all $x \in C$ we have

  $$
    \array{
      I_D  \otimes F(x) &\stackrel{\lambda^{-1}_{F(x)}}{\leftarrow}& F(x)
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{\epsilon \otimes Id}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(\lambda^{-1}_x)}}
      \\
      F(I_C) \otimes F(x)
      &\stackrel{\mu_{I,x}}{\to}& F(I_C \otimes x)
    }
  $$

  and

  $$
    \array{
      F(x) \otimes I_D &\stackrel{\rho^{-1}_{F(x)}}{\leftarrow}& F(x)
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{Id \otimes \epsilon }}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(\rho^{-1}_x)}}
      \\
      F(x) \otimes F(I_C)
      &\stackrel{\mu_{x,I}}{\to}& F(x \otimes I_C)
    }
  $$

Where $\lambda$ and $\rho$ are respectively the left and right [[unitor]]s.  We do not explicitly mention the category in which they live, as it is clear from where the subscripted object lives.

Lax monoidal functors are the [[lax morphism]] for an appropriate [[2-monad]].

If $\epsilon$ and $\mu_{x,y}$ are [[isomorphism]]s then $F$ is called a **strong monoidal functor**. If they are even identities it is called a **strict monoidal functor**. 

In contrast to this, a strong monoidal functor may also be called a **weak monoidal functor**.  Sometimes the plain term "monoidal functor" is used to mean a *strong* monoidal functor, in which case the general situation is called a **lax monoidal functor**.

An __[[oplax monoidal functor]]__ (with various alternative names including **comonoidal**), is a monoidal functor from the [[opposite categories]] $C^{op}$ to $D^{op}$.

A [[monoidal transformation]] between monoidal functors is a [[natural transformation]] that respects the extra structure in an obvious way.

If the monoidal categories are not [[strict monoidal category|strict]] one obtains correspondingly more coherence diagrams. One way to summarize these is to note that a monoidal category $C$ is equivalently its pointed [[delooping]] [[2-category]]/[[bicategory]] $\mathbf{B}C$ (with a single [[object]] and $C$ as its [[hom-object]]), then a monoidal functor $C \to D$ is equivalently a [[2-functor]]/[[pseudofunctor]] $\mathbf{B}C \to \mathbf{B}D$. Using this one can infer the coherence diagrams as special cases from those discussed at _[[pseudofunctor]]_.

## Properties

###### Observation

Lax monoidal functors send [[monoid]]s to monoids.

If $F : (C,\otimes) \to (D,\otimes)$ is a lax monoidal functor and 

$$
  (A \in C,\;\; \mu_A : A \otimes A \to A, \; i_A : I \to A)
$$

is a [[monoid]] in $C$, then the object $F(A)$ is naturally equipped with the structure of a monoid in $D$ by setting

$$
  i_{F(A)} : I_D \stackrel{}{\to} F(I_C) \stackrel{F(i_A)}{\to} F(A)
$$

and

$$
  \mu_{F(A)} : 
  F(A) \otimes F(A)
  \stackrel{\nabla_{F(A), F(A)}}{\to} 
  F(A \otimes A)
  \stackrel{F(\mu_A)}{\to}
  F(A)
  \,.
$$

This construction defines a functor

$$
  Mon(f) : Mon(C) \to Mon(D)
$$

between the categories of monoids.

Similarly, an [[oplax monoidal functor]] sends [[comonoids]] to comonoids.

###### Observation

For $(C,\otimes)$ a [[monoidal category]] write $\mathbf{B}C$ for the correspinding [[delooping]] [[2-category]].

Lax monoidal functor $f : C \to D$ correspond to [[lax 2-functor]] 

$$
  \mathbf{B}F : \mathbf{B}C \to \mathbf{B}D
  \,.
$$

If $F$ is strong monoidal then this is an ordinary [[2-functor]]. If it is strict monoidal, then this is a [[strict 2-functor]].

## String diagrams

Just like monoidal categories, monoidal functors have a [[string diagram]] calculus; see [these slides](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mmccurdy/cms2010talk.pdf) for some examples.
