A _monoidal functor_  is a [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ between [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]] $(C,\otimes_C, I_C)$ and $(D,\otimes_D, I_D)$ that respects the [[tensor product]] and the unit up to coherent but not necessarily invertible [[morphism]]s

$$
  \epsilon : I_D \stackrel{}{\to} F(I_c)  
$$

and

$$
  \mu_{x,y} : F(x) \otimes_D F(y) \to F(x \otimes_C y)
  \,.
$$

If these structure morphisms are [[isomorphism]]s then $F$ is called a **strong monoidal functor**. If they are even identities it is called a **strict monoidal functor**. The general situation is also called, for emphasis, a **lax monoidal functor**.

If we pass to the [[delooping]] [[2-category|2-categories]] $\mathbf{B}C$ and $\mathbf{B}D$ then a lax monoidal functor corresponds to a [[lax 2-functor]] 

$$
  \mathbf{B}F : \mathbf{B}C \to \mathbf{B}D
  \,.
$$

If $F$ is strong monoidal then this is an ordinary [[2-functor]]. If it is strict monoidal, then this is a [[strict 2-functor]].
