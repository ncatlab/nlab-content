O_{0,1} & \overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow} & O_{1,1} \\

is a commutative diagram in a category $\mathcal{C}$, then one meaning of _diagonal fill-in_ (synonyms: [[filler]] [[lift]]) is:

* morphism $j\colon O_{0,0}\rightarrow O_{1,1}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ making both triangles created commute. 
(That is, $f_0 = h_1 j$ and $f_1 = j h_0$.)

In certain contexts, the above commutative square is called a _lifting problem_.

If $j$ is uniquely determined (in an appropriate sense), then $h_0$ is said to be _orthogonal_ to $h_1$

This concept plays an important role in various abstract homotopy theories.
