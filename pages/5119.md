##Algebraic semantics for modal logics##

##Idea##
Classical [[propositional calculus]] has an algebraic model, namely a Boolean algebra. With a bit of imagination, one can give it a combinatorial model on the line of Kripke semantics. As this ordinary propositional logic has no modal operators, then the corresponding [[frame (modal logic)|frames]] have no relations, so are just sets.  If $W$ is such a set, (of worlds), a valuation $V: Prop \to 2^W$ just assigns to each $p \in Prop$ and $w\in W$ a truth value, $\top$ or $\bot$, (true or false).  We know however that there is a Boolean algebra structure around in that power set $2^W$ and the semantics extends the assignment given by $V$ to a map of algebras, from the term algebra based on the basic propositional language to the Boolean algebra of subsets of $W$. That is just to say that it builds up that extension of $V$ bit-by-bit on the terms. This gives an algebraic interpretation or representation of the terms of the logic in terms of the algebra of subsets of $W$, in other words an algebraic semantics.

Modal logics also have an algebraic semantics based on a Boolean algebra, but with additional operators that model the modal operators.

##Boolean algebras with operators (BAOs)##

###Boolean algebras###
We will, here, consider a [[Boolean algebra]], $\mathbb{B }$, as an algebra, and in the notation,

$$\mathbb{B} = (B, +, \cdot, \overline{},0,1)$$

so, for example, for a set $S$, the [[power set]] Boolean algebra will be

$$\mathbb{P}(S) = (\mathcal{P}(S), \cup, \cap,-,\emptyset, S),$$

where $-A$ is shorthand for the complement, $S- A$, of $A$.

###Operators###
The __operators__ that we need to add into the boolean algebras do not always preserve all the structure:

{: .un_defn}
A function, $m : B\to B$ is called an _operator_ on the Boolean algebra, $\mathbb{B}$, if it is additive

$$m(x+y) = mx + my.$$

The operator, $m$, is called _normal_ if $m0=0$.
=--

Any operator, $m$, in this sense has a dual $l : B\to B$ given by

$$l(x) = (m(x^-)^-.$$
