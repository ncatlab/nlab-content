###### Definition
A [[diagram]] $F:P\to M$ is called _projectively [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]]_ if $0\to F$ has the left lifing property with respect to component-wise acyclic fibrations.

In other words $F$ is [[projective object|projectively]] cofibrant if for any component-wise acyclic fibration $A\to B$ and any morphism $X\to B$ there is a lift

$$\array{
&&A
\\
&
\nearrow&\downarrow
\\
X
&\to&
B
}$$

making the triangle commute.

###### Example
1. A span is projectively cofibrant if it is a diagram of cofibrations in that the objects of the span are cofibrant and the morphisms are cofibrations.

1. A _cotower_ - i.e. a diagram with domain $(\mathbb{N},\le)$ is projectively cofibrant if it is a diagram of cofibrations and its value in $0$ is cofibrant.
