###### Definition
A [[diagram]] $F:P\to M$ is called _projectively [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]]_ if $0\to F$ has the left lifing property with respect to (component-wise) acyclic fibrations.

In other words $F$ is projectively cofibrant if for any acyclic cofibration $A\to B$ in $Fun(P,M)$ and any morphism $F\to B$ there is a lift

$$\array{
&&A
\\
&
\nearrow&\downarrow
\\
F
&\to&
B
}$$

making the triangle commute. In this case $F$ is [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]] since cofibrations and acyclic fibrations form a [[weak factorization system]] $(C,F\cap W)$.

###### Example
1. A span is projectively cofibrant if it is a diagram of cofibrations in that the objects of the span are cofibrant and the morphisms are cofibrations.

1. A _cotower_ - i.e. a diagram with domain $(\mathbb{N},\le)$ is projectively cofibrant if it is a diagram of cofibrations and its value in $0$ is cofibrant.
