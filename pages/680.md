#Idea#

The _Dold--Kan correspondence_ asserts that the [[nerve and realization]] [[adjunction]] between abelian 
[[simplicial group]]s and [[chain complex]]es encodes
[[infinity-groupoid]]s with abelian group structure equivalently in terms of [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups. 

Analogous statement hold for the category of abelian groups replaces by any other [[abelian category]].

This allows one

* on the one hand to understand the true conceptual home of many constructions with [[chain complex]]es in [[homological algebra]];

* on the other to efficiently compute with certain higher categorical structures.

Compare this to the role played by [[rational homotopy theory]] as a tool for handling certain [[topological space]]s.

The classical Dold--Kan correspondence states the equivalence of

: [[simplicial group|simplicial abelian groups]] $\;\simeq\;$ non-negatively graded [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups.

Since every [[simplicial group]] is a [[Kan complex]], one can equivalently read this more suggestively as 

: $\infty$-groupoids with abelian group structure $\;\simeq\;$ chain complexes$_+$ internal to abelian groups.

The fact that this involves _[[abelian group|abelian]]_ groups is essential for the correspondence. However, a similar correspondence still holds in a slightly more nonabelian context.  This and various other generalizations are described further below.


#Details#

We now spell out technical details of the classical Dold-Kan correspondence.

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem (Dold-Puppe)

For $A$ an [[abelian category]] 
there is an [[adjoint equivalence]]

$$
  N : [\Delta^{op},A] 
      \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Ch_+(A) : \Xi
$$

between 

* the category $[\Delta^{op},A]$ of [[simplicial object]]s in $A$;

* the [[category of chain complexes]] in $A$ that are 0 in negative degree,

where

* $N$ is the normalized [[Moore complex]] functor;

These functors respect the standard weak equivalences with respect to the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] [[model structure on chain complexes|and on chain complexes]] in that they induce isomorphisms between [[simplicial homotopy group]]s and [[homology]] groups.

=--

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem (Kan)

For the case that $A$ is the category of abelian groups, the functors $N$ and $\Xi$ are [[nerve and realization]] with respect to the cosimplicial chain complex

$$
  Ch_\bullet := N F_\mathbb{Z}(-): \Delta \to Ch_+(Ab)
$$

that sends the standard $n$-[[simplex]] to the normalized [[Moore complex]] of the free simplicial abelian group $F_{\mathbb{Z}}(\Delta^n)$ on the [[simplicial set]] $\Delta^n$, i.e.

$$
    \Xi(V_\bullet)_n= Hom_{Ch_\bullet(Ab)}(C_\bullet(\Delta^n), V_\bullet)
    \,.
$$

=--

Before proving this, 
first briefly recall the definition of the (normalized) [[Moore complex]]:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

For $A = (A_n)$ 
a simplicial abelian group, its **[[Moore complex]]** is

$$
  C_\bullet(A) = 
  \left(
    \cdots \to A_{n} 
     \stackrel{\partial_n :=  \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-1)^i d_i}
     {\to} A_{n-1} \to \cdots
  \right)
  \,,
$$  

where the $d_i$ are the [[simplicial set|face maps]] of $A$.

The **degenerate Moore complex** $D_\bullet(A)$
of $A$ is the full subcomplex generated from [[simplicial set|degenerate elements]] 

$$
  D_n(A) := s(A_{n-1})
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #LeftCosetsDisjoint}
###### Lemma

This is indeed well defined in that
the boundary map satisfies 
$\partial \circ \partial = 0$ in $C_\bullet(A)$
and restricts to a boundary map on the degenerate subcomplex
$\partial : A_n|_{s(A_{n-1})} \to A_{n-1}|_{s(A_{n-2})}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For the first statement one checks

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial_n \partial_{n+1}
    & =
    \sum_{i, j} 
      (-1)^{i+j}
      d_i \circ d_{j}
    \\
    &=
    \sum_{i  \geq j} (-1)^{i+j} d_i \circ d_j 
    + 
    \sum_{i \lt j} (-1)^{i+j}
      d_i \circ d_j 
    \\
    &=
    \sum_{i  \geq j} (-1)^{i+j} d_i \circ d_j 
    + 
    \sum_{i \lt j} (-1)^{i+j}
      d_{j-1} \circ d_i 
    \\
    &=
    \sum_{i  \geq j} (-1)^{i+j} d_i \circ d_j 
    -
    \sum_{i \leq k} (-1)^{i+k}
      d_{k} \circ d_i 
    \\
    &=
    0
  \end{aligned}
$$

using the [[simplicial identities|simplicial identity]] $d_i \circ d_j = d_{j-1} \circ d_i$ for $i \lt j$.

Similarly, using the mixed [[simplicial identities]] we find that for $s_j(a) \in A_n$ a degenarate element, its boundary is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     \sum_i (-1)^i d_i s_j(a)
     &=
     \sum_{i \lt j} (-1)^i  s_{j-1} d_i(a)
     +
     \sum_{i = j, j+1} (-1)^i  a
     +
     \sum_{i \gt j+1} (-1)^i s_j d_{i-1}(a)
     \\
     &=
     \sum_{i \lt j} (-1)^i  s_{j-1} d_i(a)
     +
     \sum_{i \gt j+1} (-1)^i s_j d_{i-1}(a)
  \end{aligned}
$$

which is again a combination of elements in the image of the degeneracy maps.

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma

The [[Moore complex]] splits as

$$
  C_\bullet(A) \simeq N_\bullet(A) \oplus D_\bullet(A)
$$

where the first summand is the [[Moore complex|normalized Moore complex]].

=--


+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem (Eilenberg-MacLane)

The inclusion 

$$
  N_\bullet(A) \hookrightarrow C_\bullet(A)
$$

is a [[model structure on chain complexes|homotopy equivalence]], i.e.
the complex $D_\bullet(X)$ is null-homotopic.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Following the proof of what is 
[theorem 2.1](http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/papers/g/goerss-jardine/ch-3.dvi) in Goerss-Jardine we look for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and each $j \lt n$ at the  groups

$$
  N_n(A)_j :=  \cap_{i=0}^j ker (d_i) \subset A_n
$$

and similarly at

$$
  D_n(A)_j = \{s_{i}\}_{i \leq j}(A_{n-1}) \subset A_n
  \,,
$$ 

the subgroup generated by the jirst $j$ degeneracies.

For $j= n-1$ these coincide with $N_n(A)$ and with $D_n(A)$, respectivey.  We show by induction on $j$ that the composite

$$
  N_n(A)_j \hookrightarrow A_n \stackrel{}{\to} A_n/D_n(A)_j
$$

is an isomorphism of all $j \lt n$. For $j = n-1$ this is then the desired result.

...

Now consider the free chain complex on $\Delta^n$...



# Generalizations #

There are various generalizations of the standard
Dold-Kan correspondence.

## Nonabelian versions ##

In a series of articles by Brown and Higgins, based on old work by Whitehead, the above was generalized to

: strict $\infty$-groupoids $\;\simeq\;$ crossed complexes.

Here on the left we have [[strict omega-groupoid]]s and on the right [[crossed complex]]es, a non-abelian generalization of chain complexes of groups.

: crossed complexes $\supset$ chain complexes$_+$ internal of abelian groups

There is a discussion of some of these and extensions to them to the non-Abelian case, in the entry on [[Moore complex]].


Perhaps the 'ultimate' form of a 'classical' Dold--Kan result is by Pilar Carrasco, who identified the extra structure on chain complexes of groups in order that they be [[Moore complex|Moore complexes]] of simplicial groups.  Dominique Bourn has a general form of this result for his [[semi-abelian category|semi-abelian categories]]. His results provide a neat categorical gloss on the theorem.

Dominique Bourn's formulation is very pretty. The Moore complex functor is [[monad|monadic]] when the basic category is semi-Abelian (Th. 1.4. p.113 in _Bourn2007_ below). Of course for simplicial _groups_, the  monad on chain complexes of groups gives the [[hypercrossed complex]]es of Carrasco and Cegarra, but here they fall out from the theory.  On the down side there is apparently no 
full analysis as yet of the actual form of this monad.


## Versions for monoids in abelian categories ##

The Dold-Kan correspondence (using the normalized chain complex functor) is in one direction [[monoidal category|monoidal]] in the naive (strict, 1-categorical) way, whereas in the other direction it is monoidal only in the expect homotopical sense.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The normalized chain complex functor

$$
  N : sAb \to Ch_+
$$

is a [[monoidal category|symmetric lax monoidal functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Weibel, _An introduction to homological algebra_, 8.5.4

=--

While the nerve functor $\Xi : Ch_+ \to sAb$ fails to be monoidal in such a direct way, it turns out to be monoidal in a suitable [[higher category theory|higher categorical]], i.e. [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] way.
This is the content of the following statements.


In **characteristic zero** there is also a Dold--Kan correspondence between simplicial algebras and [[dg-algebra]]s in nonnegative degrees, as well as between cosimplicial algebras and dg-algebras in nonpositive degrees, which is rather a [[Quillen equivalence]] (thus the two adjoint functors constructed in that case are inverses up to a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of dg-algebras):

* J.L. Castiglioni, G. Corti√±as, 
Cosimplicial versus DG-rings: a version of the Dold-Kan correspondence, J. Pure Appl. Algebra  191  (2004),  no. 1-2, 119--142, [arXiv:math.KT/0306289](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0306289).

* Stefan Schwede, Brooke Shipley, Equivalences of monoidal model categories, Algebr. Geom. Topol. 3 (2003), 287--334 ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0209342))

Further work along such lines is

* Birgit Richter, _Symmetry properties of the Dold-Kan correspondence_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/richter/doldkan.pdf))

This shows that the Dold-Kan map from Chain complexes to simplicial abelian groups is, while not a [[monoidal category|monoidal functor]], an $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-monoidal functor|monoidal functor]].

This implies that generalized [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]] on [[differential graded algebra|differential graded commutative algebras]] are $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-monoid|monoids]] in the category of $H \mathbb{Z}$-[[module]] [[spectrum|spectra]].

* Birgit Richter, _Homotopy algebras and the inverse of the normalization functor_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/richter/invjpaa.pdf))

This article shows that the inverse $\Xi$ from chain complexes to simplicial abelian groups sends algebras over arbitrary differential graded $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-operad|operads]] to $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-algebra|algebras]] in simplicial modules, and is part of a [[Quillen adjunction]] for these.


## Version for Lie algebras ## 

In rational homotopy theory, Quillen proved and used an analogous statement for Lie algebras: Quillen equivalence between the reduced rational dg Lie algebras and reduced rational simplicial Lie algebras:

* D. G. Quillen, Rational homotopy theory, Ann. Math. 90 (1969), 204--265.



## Parameterized version ##

The statement of the Dold--Kan correspondence generalizes to
[[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in the respective categories and this way from [[Infinity-Grpd]] to more general [[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]]:

For $X$ be a [[site]], let $Sh(X, sAb)$ be the category of 
_simplicial abelian sheaves_ -- i.e. [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial sheaves]] which take values
in simplicial abelian groups -- and let $Sh(X, Ch_+(Ab))$
be the category of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $S$ with values in
non-negatively graded [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups.
The normalized chain complex extends objectwise to a functor
$$
  Sh(X,sAb) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Sh(X, Ch_+(Ab))
$$
which is an [[equivalence]] of categories. Moreover, 
both these categories are naturally 
[[category with weak equivalences|categories with weak equivalences]]:
the weak equivalences in $Sh(X, sAb)$ are the stalkwise
[[model structure on simplicial sets|weak equivalences of simplicial sets]]
and the weak equivalences in $Sh(X, Ch_+(Ab))$ are the
[[quasi-isomorphism]]s. The normalized chain complex functor
preserves these weak equivalences.
This sheaf version of the Dold--Kan correspondence 
allows to understand [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]
as a special case of [[nonabelian cohomology]].

See page 9,10 of 

* K. Brown, [[BrownAHT|Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology]]

## $(\infinity,1)$-version ##

There is a version of the Dold-Kan correspondence in the context of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]:

let $C$ be a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]]. Then the $(\infty,1)$-categories of [[complex]]es in $C$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,1)$-category of [[simplicial object]]s in $C$

$$
  Fun(N(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}), C)
  \simeq
  Fun(N(\Delta)^{op}, C)  
  \,.
$$

This is [theorem 12.8, p. 50](http://math.mit.edu/~lurie/topoibook/DAGI.pdf) of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Stable Infinity-Categories]] 


## Related [[nerve]] constructions ## 

This gives a pattern for constructing simplicial structures, often called the _simplicial [[nerve]]_,  from algebraic structures. 

For example the nerve of a groupoid $G$ may be defined as the simplicial set which is $Ob(G)$ in dimension 0 and is given in dimension $n\gt 0$ by 

$$Nerve(G)_n= Gpd(\pi_1(\Delta^n,\Delta^n_0) , G).$$

where $\Delta^n_0$ denotes the set of vertices of $\Delta^n$. 

A [[filtered space]] $X_*$ has a fundamental crossed complex $\Pi X_*$, and a geometric simplex $\Delta^n$ has a filtration $\Delta^n_*$ by skeleta. The nerve of a [[crossed complex]] $C$ is then the simplicial set given in dimension $n$ by 

$$Nerve(C)_n= Crs(\Pi(\Delta^n_*, C).$$

This includes the case when $C$ is a [[crossed module]] (of groupoids) regarded as a crossed complex of length 2. The geometric realisation of this simplicial set gives the [[classifying space]] $BC$ of the crossed complex $C$. This space is filtered by the length of truncations of $C$ to give a filtered space $(BC)_*$ and it is a theorem that $\Pi(BC)_* \cong C$. 


An obvious analogue gives cubical or globular nerves.
