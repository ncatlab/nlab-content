The _Dold-Kan correspondence_ is the name of the [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of 

* the category [[SimpAb]] of [[simplicial set|simplicial]] abelian groups;

and

* the category $Ch_+(Ab)$ of non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups.

There is an adjoint equivalence

$$
  N : \Simp\Ab \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Ch_+(Ab) : \Xi
$$

where $N$ is the normalized chains functor, also called the [[Moore complex]].

A nice expression of the functor $\Xi$ (this was the light Kan shed on the work of Dold!) is that

 $$\Xi(C)_n= Chn(C_*(\Delta^n), C)$$

 where $C_*(\Delta^n)$ is the normalised chains of the simplicial set $\Delta^n$, and $Chn$ denotes the abelian group of chain mappings. 

This gives a pattern for constructing simplicial structures, often called the _simplicial [[nerve]]_,  from algebraic structures. 

For example the nerve of a groupoid $G$ may be defined as the simplicial set which is $Ob(G)$ in dimension 0 and is given in dimension $n\gt 0$ by 

$$Nerve(G)_n= Gpd(\pi_1(\Delta^n,\Delta^n_0) , G).$$

where $\Delta^n_0$ denotes the set of vertices of $\Delta^n$. 

A [[filtered space]] $X_*$ has a fundamental crossed complex $\Pi X_*$, and a geometric simplex $\Delta^n$ has a filtration $\Delta^n_*$ by skeleta. The nerve of a [[crossed complex]] $C$ is then the simplicial set given in dimension $n$ by 

$$Nerve(C)_n= Crs(\Pi(\Delta^n_*, C).$$

This includes the case when $C$ is a [[crossed module]] (of groupoids) regarded as a crossed complex of length 2. The geometric realisation of this simplicial set gives the [[classifying space]] $BC$ of the crossed complex $C$. This space is filtered by the length of truncations of $C$ to give a filtered space $(BC)_*$ and it is a theorem that $\Pi(BC)_* \cong C$. 


An obvious analogue gives cubical or globular nerves. 

#Remarks#

* There is a whole list of generalizations of this by Brown and Higgins, showing equivalences of various strict infinity-categories [[internal category|internal to]] $Ab$ with $Ch_+(Ab)$. 

*  There is a discussion of some of these and extensions to them to the non-Abelian case, in the entry on [[Moore complex]]
