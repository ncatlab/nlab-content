
### Idea

Implicit function theorem is about finding sufficient conditions for the existence of a differentiable inverse of a germ $f_p$ of a differentiable map $f : M\to N$ of [[smooth manifold]]s at point $p$. The invertibility is trivially equivalent to the statement that the germ is local diffeomorphism of some neighborhood of $p$ to some neighborhood of $f(p)$. If it is invertible, then we can consider the tangent map $T_p f: T_p M\to T_{f(p)}N$. If $f$ is locally invertible with differentiable inverse, then for all $y$ in some neighborhood of $y$ the functoriality of $T$ implies $Id_{T_y} = T_y (f^{-1}\circ f) = T_{f(y)}f^{-1}\circ T_y f$ and alike for $f\circ f^{-1}$ at $f(y)$ what shows that $T_y f$ must then be invertible. The theorem of inverse function says that the invertibility of $T_p f$ is in fact sufficient for the invertibility of the germ, which is then automatically differentiable. 

### In $\mathbf{R}^n$

Let $U\subset \mathbf{R}^n$ be an open set, $a\in U$, $f: U\to \mathbf{R}^n$ a map of class $C^1$ and $det\left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(a)\right)\neq 0$. Then there are open sets $V\ni a$, $W\ni f(a)$, $V\subset U$ such that $f|_V: V\to W$ is a diffeomorphism and for all $y\in W$ and $(f^{-1})'(y) = (f'[f^{-1}(y)])^{-1}$. 

### Local statement on manifolds

It is stated in idea section; the differentiable germ is assumed of class $C^1$. The statement is local, so one can consider it in charts, hence the proof reduces to the case of $\mathbf{R}^n$.

### Global statement on manifolds

Let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map of smooth manifolds. A point $q\in N$ is a __regular value__ of $f$, if for every point $p\in f^{-1}(q)$ the differential $T_p f: T_p M\to T_q N$ is an epimorphism. The implicit function theorem asserts that $Q = f^{-1}(p)$ is smooth submanifold in $M$ and the tangent bundle $T M|_N$ globally splits as $T M|_N\cong T N\oplus\mathbf{R}^n$ where $n = dim N$.

More generally, if $W\subset N$ is a submanifold we say that the map $f$ is __transversal along__ $W$ if for every point $x\in f^{-1}(W)$ there is an equality
$$
T_{f(x)} N = T_{f(x)}W + (T_x f)(T_x X)
$$ 
In particular, $f$ is transveral along every regular value $p\in N$. The theorem on implicit function asserts that the preimage $f^{-1}(W)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$ and the normal bundle $\nu(f^{-1}(W)\subset M)$ is isomorphioc to $f^*(\nu(W\subset N))$, and the differential $T f$ exhibits the fiberwise isomorphism 
$\nu(f^{-1}(W)\subset M)\to \nu(W\subset N)$.
