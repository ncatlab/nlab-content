## Idea

_Syntomic cohomology_ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of the _syntomic site_ of a [[scheme]].

It is closely related to the [[crystalline cohomology]] of that scheme. It may be regarded as an example of an [[absolute cohomology]] theory.



## References

The syntomic site was introduced in
