__Picard variety__ of a complete smooth algebraic variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field parametrizes the [[Picard group]] of $X$, more precisely the set of classes of isomorphic invertible quasicoherent sheaves with zero Chern class.

__Picard scheme__ is a scheme representing the relative Picard functor $Pic_{X/S}: (Sch/S)^{op}\to Set$. Picard functor in this generality has been introduced by [[Grothendieck]] in [[FGA]], along with the proof of representability.
