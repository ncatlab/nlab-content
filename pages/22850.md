## Definition

A **closed bicategory** is a [[bicategory]] $B$ whose composition functor

$$ B(y,z) \times B(x,y) \to B(x,z) $$

participates in a [[two-variable adjunction]].

## Remarks

A closed bicategory is a [[horizontal categorification]] of a [[closed monoidal category]].  It is not to be confused with a closed [[monoidal bicategory]], which is a [[vertical categorification]] of the same concept.
