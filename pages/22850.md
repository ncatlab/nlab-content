## Definition

A **closed bicategory** is a [[bicategory]] $B$ admitting all [[Kan extension|right extensions]] and [[Kan lift|right lifts]], whose composition functor

$${\circ} \colon B(y,z) \times B(x,y) \to B(x,z) $$

therefore participates in a [[two-variable adjunction]]. Closed bicategories were introduced by Lawvere in unpublished lecture notes *Closed categories and biclosed bicategories* (1971).

## Remarks

A closed bicategory is a [[horizontal categorification]] of a [[closed monoidal category]].  It is not to be confused with a closed [[monoidal bicategory]], which is a [[vertical categorification]] of the same concept.

Dually, a bicategory admitting all *left* extensions and lifts is called a **coclosed bicategory**, and is analogously the horizontal categorification of a [[coclosed monoidal category]]. A bicategory admitting all (right and left) extensions and lifts is a **biclosed bicategory**.
