# $\eta$-reduction and expansion

## Idea

In [[type theory]], $\eta$-reduction/expansion is a process of "computation" which is "dual" to [[beta reduction]].

Whereas $\beta$-reduction tells us how to simplify a term that involves an *eliminator* applied to a *constructor*, $\eta$-reduction tells us how to simplify a term that involves a *constructor* applied to an *eliminator*.

In contrast to beta reduction, whose "directionality" is universally agreed upon, the directionality of the eta relationship is not always the same.  Sometimes one may talk about eta **reduction**, which simplifies a constructor-eliminator pair by removing it, but we may also talk about eta **expansion**, which makes a term more complicated by introducing a constructor-eliminator pair.  The [[equivalence relation]] generated by eta reduction/expansion is called **eta equivalence**.

## Examples

### For function types

The most common example is for a [[function type]] $A\to B$.

In this case, the constructor of $A\to B$ is a *$\lambda$-expression*: given a term $b$ of type $B$ containing a free variable $x$ of type $A$, then $\lambda x.b$ is a term of type $A\to B$.

The eliminator of $A\to B$ says that given a term $f$ of type $A\to B$ and a term $a$ of type $A$, we can *apply* $f$ to $a$ to obtain a term $f(a)$ of type $B$.

An eta redex (a term that can be reduced by $\eta$ reduction) is then of the form $\lambda x. f(x)$ -- the constructor (lambda expression) applied to the eliminator (application).  Eta reduction reduces such a redex to the term $f$.

### For product types

Although function types are the most publicized notion of $\eta$-reduction, basically all types in type theory can have a form of it.  For instance, in the negative presentation of a [[product type]] $A\times B$, the constructor is an ordered pair $(a,b)\colon A\times B$, while the eliminators are projections $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ which yield elements of $A$ or $B$.

The $\eta$ rule then says that for a term $p\colon A\times B$, the term $(\pi_1 p, \pi_2 p)$ --- the constructor applied to the eliminators --- is equivalent to $p$ itself.

## Implementation

Eta reduction/expansion is not as well-behaved formally as beta reduction, and its introduction can make computational equality undecidable.  For this reason and others, it is not always implemented in computer proof assistants.

[[Coq]] versions 8.3 and prior do not implement eta equivalence (definitionally), but versions 8.4 and higher do.
