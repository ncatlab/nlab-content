## Idea

In [[logic]], the _exchange rule_ or _permutation rule_ states that the order of the [[premise]]s is irrelevant to the validity of a [[deduction]].  Along with the [[weakening rule]] and the [[contraction rule]], it is one of the most commonly adopted [[structural rules]].


## Statements

Exactly how this looks depends on the [[logic]] used.
