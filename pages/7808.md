>Astérisque journal was created in 1973 for the SMF’s first centenary. Astérisque is a top-level international journal. It publishes various monographs, renowned seminars or reports of the main international colloquiums ( available in French and English). The articles are chosen for their ability to show a research branch under a new perspective. Each volume deals with only one subject. The whole annual collection covers all the different fields of mathematics. Seven or eight volumes are published in a year. One of them is completely dedicated to Bourbaki Seminar notes.

>The editorial staff committee insists that published works should meet the highest standards as to both contents and presentation. Every manuscript is closely examined by a reporter: results, either summarised or not proved, will not be accepted. The articles are required to either contain some unusual results or to give a new viewpoint on a specific subject.
