## Idea

In ([Cartan-Eilenberg 56, XV.7](#CartanEilenberg56)) axioms for systems of bigraded [[modules]] $H(p,q)$ are given which imply the existence of a [[spectral sequence]] converging to $H(-\infty,\infty)$.

The key example of such a system are the [[relative cohomology]] groups $E^\bullet(X^q, X^p)$ of a [[filtered topological space]] (see at [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]]) for [[ordinary cohomology]] $E = H$ ([Cartan-Eilenberg 56, XV.7, Example 2](#CartanEilenberg56)) or in fact for any [[generalized cohomology theory]] $E$. In the latter case the resulting Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence came to be known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_.
