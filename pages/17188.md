## Idea

In ([Cartan-Eilenberg 56, XV.7](#CartanEilenberg56)) axioms for certain systems of bigraded [[modules]] $H(p,q)$ ("Cartan-Eilenberg systems") are given which imply the existence of a [[spectral sequence]] converging to $H(-\infty,\infty)$.

## Examples

### Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences

The key example of such a system are the [[relative cohomology]] groups $E^\bullet(X^q, X^p)$ of a [[filtered topological space]] (see at [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]]) for $E$ any [[generalized cohomology theory]]  ([Cartan-Eilenberg 56, XV.7, Example 2](#CartanEilenberg56)). That $E^\bullet(X^q, X^p)$ forms a suitable system of modules is the statement of the [exact sequence for triples](generalized+%28Eilenberg-Steenrod%29+cohomology#ExactnessForTriples) of any generalized cohomology theory.

This case of the Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence came to be known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_.
