__Robin Hartshorne__ is an algebraic geometer at Berkeley. At some point he was associated to Grothendieck's school, for example his book _Residues and duality_ is a mainly a writeup of a Grothendieck's cycle of seminars. 

His textbook __Algebraic geometry__, Springer GTM is a now a classic of the theory of schemes. The definition of [[coherent sheaf]] in that book differs from [[EGA]] definition and is well behaved on [[Noetherian scheme]]s.
