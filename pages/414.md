## Definition 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[object]] $P$ of a [[category]] $C$ is **projective** (with respect to [[epimorphisms]]) if it has the [[left lifting property]] against [[epimorphisms]]. 

=--

This means that $P$ is projective if for any [[morphism]] $f:P \to B$ and any [[epimorphism]] $q:A \to B$, $f$ factors through $q$ by some morphism $P\to A$.

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{q}} 
    \\
    P &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Yet another way to say  this is that

###### Definition

An object $P$ is projective precisely if the [[hom-functor]] $Hom(P,-)$ preserves [[epimorphisms]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This generalizes the notion of _[[projective modules]]_ over a [[ring]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There are variations of the definition where "epimorphism" is replaced by some other type of morphism, such as a [[regular epimorphism]] or [[strong epimorphism]] or the left class in some [[orthogonal factorization system]].  In this case one may speak of **regular projectives** and so on.  In a [[regular category]] "projective" almost always means "regular projective."

+-- {: .num_defn #EnoughProjectives}
###### Definition

A category $C$ has **enough projectives** if for every object $X$ there is an epimorphism $P\to X$ where $P$ is projective.

=--

This terminology refers to the existence of [[projective resolutions]], prop. \ref{EnoughIsEnough} below.



## Properties

* If $C$ has [[pullback|pullbacks]] and epimorphisms are preserved by pullback, as is the case in a [[pretopos]], then $P$ is projective iff any epimorphism $Q\to P$ is [[split epimorphism|split]].

* The [[axiom of choice]] can be phrased as "all objects of [[Set]] are projective."  See also [[internally projective object]] and [[COSHEP]].

## In abelian categories
 {#InAbelianCats}

Projective objects and [[injective objects]] in [[abelian categories]] $\mathcal{A}$ are of central interest in [[homological algebra]]. Here they appear as parts of [[cofibrant resolutions]] and [[fibrant resolutions]], respectively, in the [[category of chain complexes]] $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, with respecto to one of the two standard [[model structures on chain complexes]].

### Equivalent characterizations
 {#EquivalentCharacterizationInAbelianCats}

+-- {: .num_prop #EquivalenceOfDefinitionsInAbelian}
###### Proposition

The following are equivalent

1. $X \in \mathcal{A}$ is a projective object (in that it has the [[left lifting property]] against [[epimorphisms]], def. \ref{ByCovHomPreservingEpis});

1. The [[hom-functor]] $Hom(X,-) : \mathcal{A} \to $ [[Ab]] is an [[exact functor]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

For every object $X$, the hom-functor $Hom(X,-)$ is a [[left exact functor]]. So the second statement is equivalently that it is also right exact precisely if $X$ is projective.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
**of prop. \ref{EquivalenceOfDefinitionsInAbelian}**

Let 

$$
  0 \to A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} B \stackrel{p}{\to} C \to 0
$$

be a [[short exact sequence]] and consider

$$
  Hom(X,A) 
    \stackrel{Hom(X,i)}{\to}
  Hom(X,B)
   \stackrel{Hom(X,p)}{\to}
  Hom(X,C)
  \,.
$$

Since $Hom(X,-)$ is generally left exact, by the above remark, it preserves [[kernels]] and so $Hom(X,p)$ is a [[monomorphism]] and $ker( Hom(X,p) ) \simeq im ( Hom(X,i) )$, generally. 

Therefore we are reduced to showing that $Hom(X,p)$ is an [[epimorphism]] precisely if $X$ is projective. But this is def. \ref{ByCovHomPreservingEpis}.

### Projective resolutions

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $N \in \mathcal{A}$ an object, a **[[projective resolution]]** of $N$ is a [[chain complex]] $(Q N)_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ equipped with a [[chain map]]

$$
  Q N \to N
$$

(with $N$ regarded as a complex concentrated in degree 0) such that

1. this morphism is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] (this is what makes it a [[resolution]]), which is equivalent to 

   $$ \cdots \to (Q N)_1 \to (Q N)_0 \to N $$

   being an [[exact sequence]];

1.  all whose entries $(Q N)_n$ are projective objects.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means precisely that $Q N \to N$ is an [[cofibrant resolution]] with respect to the standard [[model structure on chain complexes]] (see [here](model%20structure%20on%20chain%20complexes#StandardQuillenOnBounded)) for which the fibrations are the positive-degreewise epimorphisms. Notice that in this model structure every object is fibrant, so that cofibrant resolutions are the only resolutions that need to be considered.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EnoughIsEnough}
###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{A}$ has _enough projectives_ in the sense of defn \ref{EnoughProjectives}, then every object has a projective resolution.

=--





## Examples

* An object in [[Ab]], an [[abelian group]], is projective precisely if it is a [[free group]].

* For $R$ a [[commutative ring]], an object in  $R$[[Mod]], an $R$-[[module]], is projective (a [[projective module]], see there for more details) precisely if it is a [[direct sum|direct summand]] of a [[free module]]. See at _[[projective module]]_ for more on this.
