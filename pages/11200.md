## Idea

A [[sheaf of spectra]] on the [[site]] of all [[smooth manifolds]] may be thought of as a [[spectrum]] equipped with generalized [[smooth structure]], in just the same way as an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] on this site may be thought of as a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]. Therefore one might speak of the [[stable (∞,1)-category]]

$$
  Sh_\infty(SmoothMfd, Spectra)
  \simeq
  Stab(Sh_\infty(SmoothMfd))
  =
  Stab(Smooth \infty Grpd)
$$

which is the [[stabilization]] of that of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] as being the $\infty$-category of _smooth specta_, just as the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] itself is the [[stabilization]] of that of bare [[∞-groupoids]].

Together with [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] smooth spectra sit inside the [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] over smooth manifolds. By the discussion [there](tangent+cohesive+∞-topos#CohesiveAndDifferentialRefinement), every smooth spectrum sits in a diagram which exhibits it ([Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)) as the moduli of a generalized [[differential cohomology]] theory  (in generalization of how every ordinary spectrum, via the [[Brown representability theorem]], corresponds to a bare [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]]).
