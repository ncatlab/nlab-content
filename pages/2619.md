#Definition#

Let $E$ be a small, cocomplete category. An object $e$ of $E$ is **tiny** if the hom-functor $E(e, -) : E \to Set$ preserves small colimits.

Tiny objects are also sometimes called **small-[[projective object]]s**.

_Todd_: Hm, I'm not familiar with that term. Who calls it that? (The link to [[projective object]] only mentions preservation of epimorphisms or perhaps regular epimorphisms = coequalizer maps.)

If homming out of a tiny object even has a [[right adjoint]] and hence preserves _all_ colimits, it is called an [[infinitesimal object|atomic object]]. The right adjoint is sometimes called an [[amazing right adjoint]], particularly in the context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]. If $E$ is a sheaf topos, then tiny objects and infinitesimal objects coincide. 


#Examples#

* In a [[presheaf]] category every [[representable functor|representable]] is a tiny object: since colimits of presheaves are computed objectwise (see [[limits and colimits by example]]) and using the [[Yoneda lemma]] we have for $U$ a [[representable]] functor and $F : J \to PSh$ a diagram that

  $$
    Hom(U, \lim_\to F) \simeq (\lim_\to F)(U) \simeq \lim_\to F(U)
  $$

  where now the last [[colimit]] is in [[Set]].

In the context of [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of categories, every tiny object may be construed as a representable presheaf, provided that we change the site from a small category $C$ to its Cauchy completion or [[Karoubi envelope]] $\bar{C}$, which gives the same presheaves up to equivalence.
