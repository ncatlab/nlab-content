A morphism $f:X\to Y$ of [[schemes]] is an __open immersion__ if the underlying morphism of topological spaces is a [[homeomorphism]] onto an open [[image]] and the [[comorphism]] $f^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_Y\to f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is an [[isomorphism]] of sheaves when restricted to the image of $f$. In other words, an open immersion is a morphism of schemes which decomposes uniquely into an isomorphism of schemes and the identity [[inclusion morphism|inclusion]] of an [[open subscheme]].
