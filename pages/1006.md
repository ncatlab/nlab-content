## Idea

An **$n$-Lie algebra** is defined to be an algebraic structure which

* looks formally like the special case of an $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebra]] for which only the $n$-ary bracket $D_n$ is non-vanishing (see there);

* _but_ without necessarily the grading underlying an $L_\infty$-algebra, and in particular without the requirement that $D_n$ be of homogeneous degree $-1$ in any grading.

Therefore, any "$n$-Lie algebras" that appear in the literature are **not** examples of _[[Lie n-algebras]]_, hence of  _[[L-∞ algebras]]_.
(So in particular $n$-Lie algebras in this sense in general don't integrate to [[Lie infinity-groupoids]] via the usual [[Lie theory]]. )

Instead, at least certain "3-Lie algebras" can be understood as encoding structure in [[Lie 2-algebras]] equipped with a binary [[invariant polynomial]] ([Saemann-Ritter 13, section 2.5](#SaemannRitter13)).

### Re-inventions

The notion of $n$-Lie algebras, for $n=3$, was re-invented by string physicists in the [[BLG model]]

* [[Jonathan Bagger]], [[Neil Lambert]], _Gauge Symmetry and Supersymmetry of Multiple M2-Branes_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0955))

which sparked a tremendous amount of [activity](http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~ahoop08/klose.pdf).

Further re-inventions of the concept of $n$-Lie algebras in this context are appearing. For instance in

A sensible interpretation of $3$-Lie algebras as expressible in  [[Lie 2-algebras]] equipped with a binary [[invariant polynomial]] is in section 2.5 of
