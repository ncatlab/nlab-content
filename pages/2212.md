## Idea ##

A _cosimplicial algebra_ -- similarly a cosimplicial ring -- is a [[cosimplicial object]] in the category of [[algebra]]s (of [[ring]]s).

## Relation to differential graded algebras ##

Under the [[monoidal Doldâ€“Kan correspondence]], cosimplicial algebras are essentially identified with [[differential graded algebra]]s in non-negative degree: the [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex]] $C^\bullet(A)$ of a cosimplicial algebra $A$ is a [[differential graded algebra]] where the degreewise product on the cosimplicial algebra maps to the [[cup product]] operation that gives the [[monoid]] structure $C^\bullet(A)$.


## Model category structure ##

A standard [[model category]] structure on the category of cosimplicial rings is the following

* fibrations are the degreewise surjections

* weak equivalences are the morphisms that induce isomorphisms in [[cohomotopy]]

* cofibrations are defined by their left [[lifting property]].

See for instance [def 9.1, p. 18](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0306/0306289v3.pdf#page=18) of 

* Castiglioni, Cortinas, _Cosimplicial versus dg-rings_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0306289))


## Examples ##

As cosimplcial algebras are [[duality|dual]] to simplicial spaces, each simplicial space $X$ gives rise to a cosimplicial algebra of functions on it. A list of examples is given at [[schreiber:Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]].
