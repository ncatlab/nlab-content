The *Sorgenfrey line* (after [[Robert Sorgenfrey]], a mathematical descendant of [[R.L. Moore]]) is the real line $\mathbb{R}$, but topologized by taking as [[base|topological basis]] the collection of half-open intervals $[a, b)$. This is sometimes called the *lower limit topology*, and the Sorgenfrey line is often denoted by $\mathbb{R}_l$. 

The Sorgenfrey line and spaces derived from it, notably the *Sorgenfrey plane* $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ (with the [[product topology]]), is a rich source for counterexamples in [[general topology]]. For example, the Sorgenfrey line is a ($T_1$) [[normal space]] and even a [[paracompact space]], but the Sorgenfrey plane fails to be normal (and thus is not paracompact either). The Sorgenfrey plane is also an example of a [[separable space]], but admitting an [[uncountable set|uncountable]] [[discrete space|discrete]] [[subspace]] (which is thus not separable), showing that separability is not a hereditary property.
