## Idea

On [[super smooth infinity-groupoids]] there is a [[modal operator]] $\beta$ which projects onto the bosonic components of the [[supergeometry]]. On [[formal dual]] [[superalgebras]] this is given by passing to the _[[body]]_. In terms of [[physical fields]] this is the projection onto [[boson]] fields, which are hence the [[modal types]] of $\beta$, and so it makes sense to speak of the _bosonic modality_.

This has a [[left adjoint]] $\epsilon$ (which on superalgebras passes to the even-graded sub-algebra) and hence together these form an [[adjoint modality]] which may be thought of as characterizing the [[supergeometry]]. See at _[super smooth infinity-groupoid -- Cohesion](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/super+smooth+infinity-groupoid#Cohesion)_. With $\epsilon$ being opposite to $\beta$ thereby, it makes sense to call it the _fermionion modality_.

Notice that the fermionic [[currents]] in [[physics]] (i.e. the [[electron]] density current) are indeed fermionic bilinears, i.e. are indeed in the even subalgebras of the underlying superalgebra.

$$
  \array{
    fermions & \epsilon &\stackrel{}{\dashv}& \beta & bosons
  }
$$

As a further mnemonic, take "$\beta$" to be reminisnces of [[beta decay]], exhibiting one of the fundamental bosonic [[forces]] (the [[weak nuclear force]]) in the [[standard model of particle physics]], and observe that $\epsilon$ is the standard symbol for a fermionic [[supersymmetry]] generator.
