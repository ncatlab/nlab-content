Given [[set]]s $A$ and $B$, the [[function set]] $A^B$ is the set of all [[function]]s from $B$ to $A$.  In the [[foundations]] of mathematics, the existence of such a set may be taken to follow from the existence of [[power set]]s, from the axiom of [[subset collection]], or as an axiom in its own right.

Thinking of [[Set]] as a [[locally small category]], this is a special case of a [[hom-set]].  Thinking of $\Set$ as a [[cartesian closed category]], this is a special case of an [[exponential object]], which is a special case of an [[internal hom]].
