## Definition

A simplicial complex $K$ is a set of objects, $V(K)$, called **vertices** and a set, $S(K)$, of finite non-empty subsets of $V(K)$, called **simplices**.  The simplices satisfy the condition that if $\sigma \subset V(K)$ is a simplex and $\tau \subset \sigma$, $\tau \ne \emptyset$, then $\tau$ is also a simplex.  

We say $\tau$ is a **face** of $\sigma$.  If $\sigma \in S(K)$ has $p+1$ elements it is said to be a **$p$-simplex**.  The set of $p$-simplices of $K$ is denoted by $K_p$. The **dimension** of $K$ is the largest $p$ such that $K_p$ is non-empty.

## Simplicial complexes v. simplicial sets

Simplicial complexes are, in some sense, special cases of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]], but only 'in some sense'. To get from a simplicial complex to a simplicial set, you must pick a total order on the set of vertices. Without an order on the vertices you cannot speak of the $k^{th}$ face of a simplex, which is an essential feature of a simplicial set! The degeneracies are obtained by repeating an element when listing the vertices of a simplex. If $\sigma = \{v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$, with $v_0\lt v_1\lt \ldots \lt v_n$ then, for instance, $s_0(\sigma) = \{v_0,v_0, v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$. 

Indeed, simplicial sets are essentially (that is, up to equivalence) presheaves on the category of finite nonempty totally ordered sets, whereas simplicial complexes may be regarded as certain types of presheaves on the category $Fin_{inj}$ of finite nonempty sets and injections between them. This works as follows: given a simplicial set $K = (V(K), S(K))$, define a presheaf $K^\sim: Fin_{inj}^{op} \to Set$ whose values are sets of injections $\phi$: 

$$K^\sim(B) \stackrel{def}{=} \{\phi: B \hookrightarrow V(K)| \phi(B) \in S(K)\}, \qquad K^\sim(i: A \to B)(\phi) \stackrel{def}{=} \phi \circ i$$ 

This defines an evident functor 

$$SimpComplex \to Set^{Fin_{inj}^{op}}: K \mapsto K^\sim$$ 

that is full and faithful. In fact, following a suggestion of James Dolan, Baez and Hoffnung characterize the category of simplicial complexes up to equivalence as the full subcategory of [[concrete sheaf|concrete sheaves]] on $Fin_{inj}$ with respect to the trivial [[Grothendieck topology|topology]] (where the only covering sieve $F \hookrightarrow hom(-, D)$ is the maximal sieve). 

It follows from this characterization that the category of simplicial complexes is a [[quasitopos]], and in particular is locally cartesian closed. The category of simplicial sets on the other hand is a [[topos]]. 

##Geometric realisations and Polyhedra##
An abstract simplicial complex is a combinatorial gadget that models certain aspects of a spatial configuration.  Sometimes it is useful, perhaps even necessary, to produce a topological space from that data in a simplicial complex. 



### Idea

To each simplicial complex $K$, one can associate a topological space called the _polyhedron_ of $K$ often also called or  _geometric realisation_ of $K$ and denoted $|K|$.   


This can be constructed by taking a copy $K(\sigma)$ of a standard topological $p$-simplex for each $p$-simplex of $K$ and then 'gluing' them together according to the face relations encoded in $K$.



#### Definition

The _standard (topological) $p$-simplex_ is usually  taken to be the convex hull of the basis vectors $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{e}_{p+1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{p+1}$, to represent each abstract $p$-simplex, $\sigma\in S(K)$, and then 'gluing' faces together, so whenever $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma$ we identify $K(\tau)$ with the corresponding face of $K(\sigma)$. This space is usually denoted $\Delta^p$.

#### Canonical constructions

As a set, $|K|$ is constructed as follows: 

$|K|$ is the set of all functions from $V(K)$ to  the closed interval $[0,1]$ such that

* if $\alpha \in |K|$, the set
 
$$\{v \in V(K) \mid \alpha(v)  \neq  0\}$$

is a simplex of $K$;

 * for each $v\in V(K)$,  
$$\sum_{\alpha \in V(K)} \alpha (v) = 1.$$

There are two commonly used topologies on the set $|K|$. The first is the _metric topology_: we put a metric $d$ on $|K|$ by 

$$d(\alpha,\beta) = \Big(\sum_{v\in V(K)} (\alpha(v) - \beta(v))^2\Big)^\frac{1}{2}.$$

$|K|$, when endowed with the metric space topology, will be denoted $|K|_d$. Notice that when $V(K)$ is finite, this gives $|K|_d$ as a subspace of the metric space $\mathbb{R}^{\#(V(K))}$ (which is usually of much higher dimension than might seem geometrically significant in a given context). 

The second topology is the _coherent topology_: each geometric simplex $|s|$ consists of all $\alpha \in |K|$ supported in $s$, and is given the subspace topology inherited as a subset of $|K|_d$; then the coherent topology on $|K|$ is the largest topology for which all inclusions $|s| \hookrightarrow |K|$ are continuous. This topological space is normally denoted just $|K|$, reflecting the fact that the coherent topology is regarded as the default topology to put on the set $|K|$. 

Note that if $s \subseteq t$ is an inclusion of simplices in $K$, then there is an induced subspace inclusion $|s| \hookrightarrow |t|$. The space $|K|$ may then be characterized as the colimit in $Top$ of the diagram consisting of geometric simplices $|s|$ and inclusions between them, so that a function $f: |K| \to X$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to each simplex $|s|$ is continuous. In particular, the identity function $|K| \to |K|_d$ is continuous, so that the coherent topology contains the metric topology (and is often strictly larger). 

### Triangulable spaces

If a topological space can be described up to homeomorphism as the geometric realization of a simplicial complex, we say it is **triangulable**, and a **triangulation** of a space $X$ is a simplicial complex $K$ together with a homeomorphism $h: |K| \to X$. 

There is another stronger notion of triangulation used by topologists: a **piecewise-linear (PL) structure** on a space $X$ is a triangulation where the link of every simplex in $K$ is a PL triangulation of a sphere.

This is as best as I can make out from reading Wikipedia. The definition looks recursive. Obviously I haven't filled in the definition of link.

#### Examples from manifold theory

* All [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] are triangulable and in fact admit PL structures. 

* All topological manifolds in dimensions 2 and 3 admit PL structures, and are in fact smoothable (admit a smooth manifold structure). 

* The $E_8$ [[E8 manifold|manifold]] does not admit a triangulation, much less a PL structure. 

* In dimensions $n \geq 5$, the $(n-2)$-fold suspension of the [[Poincare sphere]] is homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere, hence is triangulable, but it does not admit a PL structure. 

#### Relation to simplicial sets

The following statement may seem obvious, but it requires careful proof: 

* A space is triangulable if and only if it is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a simplicial set. 

As an important step: 

* The geometric realization of the nerve of a poset is triangulable. 

(These statements should actually be treated as conjectures for the moment until I write out careful proofs. The basic technique is subdivision.)
