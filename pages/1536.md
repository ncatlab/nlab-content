## Idea 

In any context it is of interest to ask which kind of [[morphisms]] 

$$
  \array{
    E
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    C
  }
$$

arise as [[pullbacks]] along a classifying morphism $S_p : C \to U$ to 
some universal object $U$ of some universal morphism 

$$
  \array{
    \hat U
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{univ}}}
    \\
    U
  }
  \,.
$$

The **Grothendieck construction** describes this in the context of [[Cat]]: a morphism $p : E \to C$ of [[category|categories]] -- i.e. a [[functor]] -- is called a [[fibered category]] or [[Grothendieck fibration]] if it is encoded in a [[pseudofunctor]]/[[2-functor]] $S_p : C^{op} \to Cat$.

The reconstruction of $p$ from the pseudofunctor $S_p$ is the **Grothendieck construction** 

$$
  \int \;\; : \;\; Func(C^{op}, Cat) \to Cat/C
$$

which is a [[2-functor]] from the [[2-category]] of pseudofunctors $C^{op} \to Cat$ to the [[overcategory]] of [[Cat]] over $C$.

The essential image of this functor consists of [[Grothendieck fibration]]s and this establishes an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of [[2-categories]]

$$
  \int : Func(C^{op}, Cat) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Fib(C) 
$$

between 2-functors $C^{op} \to Cat$ and [[Grothendieck fibration]]s over $C$.

When restricted to pseudofunctors with values in [[Grpd]] $\subset$ [[Cat]] this identifies the [[fibration fibered in groupoids|Grothendieck fibrations in groupoids]]

$$
  \int \;\;:\;\; Func(C^{op}, Grpd) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} FibGrpd(C) 
  \,.
$$

This equivalence notably allows to discuss [[stack]]s equivalently as pseudofunctors or as groupoid fibrations (in each case satisfying a [[descent]] condition with respect to a [[Grothendieck topology]] on $D$).

The Grothendieck construction is one of the central aspects of [[category theory]], together with the notions of universal constructions such as [[limit]], [[adjunction]] and [[Kan extension]]. It is expected to have suitable analogs in all sufficiently good contexts of [[higher category theory]]. Notably there is an [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]] in [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.


## Definition 

Let [[Cat]] be the [[2-category]] of [[categories]], [[functor]]s and [[natural transformation]]s.  In line with the philosophy of [[generalized universal bundles]], the "universal [[Cat]]-[[bundle]]" is $Cat_{*,\ell} \to Cat$.  Here $Cat_{*,\ell}$ denotes the (2-)category of "lax-[[pointed object|pointed]]" [[categories]], also known as the "lax slice" of $Cat$ under the [[terminal category]] $*\in Cat$.  Its objects are pointed categories, i.e. pairs $(A,a)$ where $A$ is a category and $a$ is an object of $A$, and its morphisms $(A,a) \to (B,b)$ are pairs $(f,\gamma)$ where $f\colon A\to B$ is a functor and $\gamma\colon f(a)\to b$ is a morphism in $B$.  The projection $Cat_{*,\ell} \to Cat$ is just the forgetful functor.

Then if $F\colon C \to Cat$ is a [[pseudofunctor]] from a category $C$ to $Cat$, the **Grothendieck construction** for $F$ is the (strict) [[2-pullback]] $ p : \int F \to C$ of $Cat_{*,\ell} \to Cat$ along $F$:

$$
  \array{
    \int F &\to& Cat_{*,\ell}
    \\
    {}^{p}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C &\overset{F}{\to}& Cat
  }
  \,.
$$

This means that

* the objects of $\int F$ are pairs $(c,a)$, where $c \in Obj(C)$ and $a \in Obj(F(c))$ 

* and morphisms in $\int F$ are given by pairs $(c \overset{f}{\to} c', F(f)(a) \overset{\alpha}{\to} a')$. This may be visualized as

$$
  \int F = 
  \left\{
  \array{
    && {*}
    \\
    & {}^a\swarrow &\seArrow^{\alpha}& \searrow^{a'}
    \\
    F(c) && \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} && F(c')
    \\
    \\
    c &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& c'
  }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This extends to a 2-functor between [[bicategories]]

$$
  \int \;\; : \;\; [C, Cat] \to Cat/C
$$

from [[pseudofunctor]]s on $C$ to the [[overcategory]] of [[Cat]] over $C$.

The more commonly described version of this construction works instead on contravariant pseudofunctors, i.e. pseudofunctors $C^{op}\to Cat$.  In this case we use instead the "universal $Cat$-cobundle" $(Cat_{*,c})^{op} \to Cat^{op}$, where $(Cat_{*,c})$ is the colax slice, whose objects are  again pointed categories $(A,a)$, but whose morphisms $(A,a) \to (B,b)$ are pairs $(f,\gamma)$ where $f\colon A\to B$ and $\gamma\colon b \to f(a)$.  Now the 2-pullback

$$
  \array{
    \int F &\to& (Cat_{*,c})^{op}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C &\stackrel{F}{\to}& Cat^{op}
  }
  \,.
$$

describes a 2-functor

$$ \int \quad\colon\quad [C^{op},Cat] \to Cat/C. $$

In this case,

* the objects of $\int F$ are again pairs $(c,a)$, where $c \in Obj(C)$ and $a \in Obj(F(c))$, but

* the morphisms in $\int F$ from $(c,a)$ to $(c',a')$ are pairs $(c \overset{f}{\to} c', a \overset{\alpha}{\to} F(f)(a'))$.


## The equivalence between fibrations and pseudofunctors

One can characterize the _image_ of the Grothendieck construction
as consisting precisey of those objects in $Cat/C$ that are
[[Grothendieck fibration]]s.

We recall the definition of the [[bicategory]] of Grothendieck fibrations 
and [[pseudofunctor]]s and
and then state the main equivalence theorem.

### The bicategory of pseudofunctors.

A [[pseudofunctor]] from a 1-[[category]] $C$ to a [[2-category]] ([[bicategory]]) $A$ is nothing but a (non-strict) [[2-functor]] between bicategories, with the ordinary category regarded as a special bicategory.

We write $[C^{op}, A]$ for the [[2-functor]] 2-category from the 
[[opposite category]] of $C$ to $A$ (the $op$ here is just convention):

* objects are pseudofunctors $F : C^{op} \to A$;

* morphism are [[lax natural transformation|pseudonatural transformations]];

* 2-morphism are [[modification]]s.


### The bicategory of fibrations

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition


A [[functor]] $p : E \to C$ is a **[[Grothendieck fibration]]**
if for every object $e \in E$ and every morphism $f : c \to p(e)$
in $C$ there is a morphism $\hat f : \hat c \to e$ in $E$ that lifts
$f$ in that $p(\hat f) = f$ and which is a [[Cartesian morphism]].

A **morphism of Grothendieck fibrations $F : (p : E \to C) \to (p' : E' \to C)$ is

* a functor $F : E \to E'$

* such that

  * $F$ sends [[Cartesian morphism]]s to Cartesian morphisms;

  * the diagram

    $$
      \array{
        E &&\stackrel{F}{\to}&& E'
        \\
        & {}_{\mathllap{p}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p'}}
        \\
        && C
      }
    $$

    in [[Cat]] commutes (strictly).

* a **2-morphism** between morphism $\eta : F \to F'$ is a 
  [[natural transformation]] of the underlying functors, that also makes
  the obvious diagram 2-commute, i.e. such that 
  $p' \cdot \eta$ is trivial.


Compositions are those induced from the underlying functors and natural transformations.

This defines the **[[2-category]] of Grothendieck fibrations** 

$$
  Fib(C) \hookrightarrow Cat/C
$$

over $C$, being a 2-[[subcategory]] of the [[overcategory]] of [[Cat]] over $C$.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark


Cartesian lifts are not required to be unique, but are automatically unique up to a unique vertical [[isomorphism]] connecting their domains.


=--


### Statement of the equivalence


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The Grothendieck construction factors through [[Grothendieck fibration]]s over $C$

$$
  \int : [C^{op}, Cat] \to Fib(C) \hookrightarrow Cat/C
$$

and establishes an equivalence of bicategories

$$
  \int : [C^{op}, Cat] \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Fib(C)
  \,.
$$

In fact, it is more than that: it is an equivalence of [[strict 2-categories]], in the sense of strict 2-category theory, i.e. an equivalence of $Cat$-[[enriched categories]].

When restricted to pseudofunctors that factor through [[Grpd]] $\hookrightarrow Cat$ it factors through [[fibrations in groupoids]]

$$
  \int : [C^{op}, Grpd] \to Fib_{Grpd}(C)\hookrightarrow Cat/C
$$

and establishes a similar equivalence

$$
  [C^{op}, Grpd] \simeq Fib_{Grpd}(C)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This can be verified by straightforward albeit somewhat tedious checking. Details are spelled out in section 1.2 of

* [[Peter Johnstone]], _Sketches of an Elephant_ 

The statement itself is theorem 1.3.6 there, all definitions and lemmas are on the pages before that.

=--

### Model category version

For the case of pseudofunctors with values in groupoids, there is a [[model category]] version of the Grothendieck construction discussed in

* [[Sharon Hollander]], _A homotopy theory for stacks_ ([arXiv:math.AT/0110247](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0110247)).

There the statement of the above equivalence is the statement that the Grothendieck equivalence exhibits a [[Quillen equivalence]] between suitable [[model category]] structures on functors from and to $C$.

This model category incarnation of the Grothendieck construction 
generalizes to a model category presentation of the 
[[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]].


## Adjoints to the Grothendieck construction {#adjunction}

The Grothendieck construction functor

$$
  \int : [C^{op}, Cat] \to Cat/C
$$

has a left and a right [[adjoint functor]].

Restricted to [[Grothendieck fibration]]s and [[fibrations in groupoids]], these exhibit the above equivalences as an [[adjoint equivalence]]s.

### The left adjoint

The [[left adjoint]] is the functor

$$
  L : (p : E \to C) \mapsto ( (-)/p : C^{op} \to Cat) 
$$

that assigns to a functor $p$ the presheaf which sends $c \in C$ to the [[comma category]] 

$$
  c/p = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      && c
      \\
      & \swarrow && \searrow
      \\
      p(e_1) &&\to&& p(e_2)
    }
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

i.e.

$$
  L(E \stackrel{p}{\to}C) : c \mapsto c/p
  \,.
$$

This functor may equivalently be expressed as follows:

for given $(E \stackrel{p}{\to} C)$ consider the [[weak limit|weak pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    E &\hookrightarrow& E^{\triangleright}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    C &\to& K(p)
  }
$$

of _[[2-categories]]_  (so that $K(p)$ is a [[2-category]]) where $K^{\triangleright}$ is $K$ with one [[terminal object]] $v$ adjoined (a [[join of quasi-categories|join]] of categories).

#### In terms of a cone construction {#Cone}

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Claim

We have

$$
  c/p \simeq Hom_{K(p)}(c,v)
  \,.
$$

And hence the left adjoint to the Grothendieck construction may be realized as the assignment that sends $p : E \to C$ to the pseudofunctor 

$$
  L(p) := Hom_{K(p)}(-, v) : C^{op} \to Cat
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is convenient to compute the weak pushout by embedding the situation from [[Cat]] into the bigger context of [[(∞,1)-categories]] and using the [[model category|model]] of that provided by [[sSet]]: the [[model structure for quasi-categories]]. This also facilitates the generalization of the argument from 1-categories to higher categories.

So consider equivalently the weak pushout diagram

$$
  \array{
    N(E) &\hookrightarrow& N(E)^{\triangleright}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{N(p)}} &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    N(C) &\to& N(K(p))
  }
$$

of [[quasi-categories]], where $N(-)$ is the [[nerve]] operation and where $N(E)^{\triangleright} = N(E) \star *$ is the [[join of simplicial sets]] of $N(E)$ with the [[point]]. 

By the general yoga of [[homotopy colimit]]s (see there for details) we know that this $\infty$-pushout here may be computed as an ordinary [[pushout]] in the 1-category [[sSet]] if the pushout diagram $N(C) \leftarrow N(E) \to N(E)^{\triangleright} $ has the property that

* all three objects are cofibrant;

* at least one of the two morphisms is a cofibration

in the [[model structure for quasi-categories]] $sSet_{Joyal}$.

But this is trivially verified since the cofibrations in $sSet_{Joyal}$ are just the [[monomorphism]]s in [[sSet]]: the degreewise injective maps of simplicial sets. So every object in $sSet_{Joyal}$ is cofibrant and the inclusion $N(E) \hookrightarrow N(E)^{\triangleright}$ is a cofibration. 

(The same conclusion would hold for the same simple reasons in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] $sSet_{Quillen}$.)

From this it follows that simply because we passed from categories to their [[nerve]]s, the computation of the weak pushout reduces to the computation of an ordinary pushout (one may think of passing to nerves as providing a cofibrant replacement: since in the nerve all composition of [[k-morphism]]s is "freed", the nerve is a suitably "puffed up" version of a category that is suitable for computing $\infty$-pushouts).

So we are reduced to computing the ordinary [[pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    N(E) &\hookrightarrow& N(E)^{\triangleright}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{N(p)}} && \downarrow
    \\
    N(C) &\to& Q
  }
$$
 
in [[sSet]]. The fibrant replacement of $Q$ is then the [[nerve]] of [[generalized the|the]] [[bicategory]] $K(p)$ that we are after.

As recalled at [[limits and colimits by example]] in the section [limits in presheaf categories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/limits+and+colimits+by+example#limitsinpresheafcat), [[colimit]]s (and hence pushouts) in the [[presheaf]]-category [[sSet]] $= Func(\Delta^{op}, Set)$ are computed for each object $[n] \in \Delta$ as ordinary colimits in [[Set]].

For **$n=0$** we see that $Q_0$ is the collection of objects of $C$ and one additional vertex $v$:

$$
 Q_0 = N(C)_0  \coprod \{ v\} = p(Obj(E)) \coprod \{v \}
$$


For **$n=1$**  similarly we find that $Q_1$ consists of the 1-cells in in $C$ and in addition of one 1-cell $e : c \to v$ for each $e \in Obj(E)$ with $p(e) = c$ (this 1-cell is really the terminal 1-cell $e \to v$ in $E^{\triangleright}$ but with its source re-interpreted as being $p(e) = c$ according to the identification of $Q_0$ as above). In the fibrant replacement of $Q$ the composite of original 1-cells $c_1 \to c_2$ and the new 1-cells $e : c_2 \to v$ will be freely added, so that the general 1-morphism $c_1 \to v$ will consist of a 1-morphism $c_1 \to c_2$ in $C$ together with a lift of $c_2$ to $E$. This is just as in the [[comma category]] $c/p$.

For **$n=2$** we have in $Q_2$ the 2-cells in $C$ as well as one 2-cell

$$
  \array{
    c_1 &&\to&& c_2
    \\
    & \searrow &{}^{(e_1 \to e_2)}\swArrow& \swarrow
    \\
    && v
  }
$$

for each 1-cell $(e_1 \to e_2)$ in $N(E)$ with $p(e_1 \to e_2)$ = $(c_1 \to c_2)$.

In particular this means that if $e_2: c_2 \to v$ is a morphism in $Q$ and $c_1 \to c_2$ is a morphism in $C$, then the composite $c_1 \to c_2 \to v$ in $Q$ is homotopic to any compatible direct morphism $c_1 \to v$ in $Q$.

This means that forming the fibrant replacement of $Q$ in $sSet_{Joyal}$ will not throw in superfluous 1-morphisms on top of those we already discussed in the previous paragraph...


Now furthermore...

=--


This formulation of the Grothendieck construction as an adjunction

$$
  (L \dashv \int) : Fib(C) \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} [C^{op}, Cat]
$$

with the left adjoint given by hom-objects in a pushout object as above
is the starting point for the [[vertical categorification]] described at [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]]. 




## Generalizations 

### $n = 0$ 

The analog of the Grothendieck construction one categorical dimension down is the [[category of elements]] of a [[presheaf]].

### $n = (\infty,1)$  {#(oo1)case}

The analog of the Grothendieck construction for [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] is described at [[Cartesian fibration]] and at [[universal fibration of (∞,1)-categories]]. 

The correspondence between $(\infty,1)$-categorical [[cartesian fibrations]] $E \to C$ and [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(∞,1)-presheaves]] $C \to (\infty,1)Cat^{op}$ is [[model category|modeled]] by the [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure on marked simplicial over-sets]] and the projective [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

For more details see

* [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]]


## Warning on terminology ##

The term 'Grothendieck Construction' is applied in the literature to at least two very different constructions (and as [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] introduced so many new ideas and constructions to mathematics, perhaps there are others!). One concerns the construction of a [[fibered category]] from a [[pseudofunctor]] and will be treated in more detail in the entry on [[Grothendieck fibration]].  The other referes to constructing the [[Grothendieck group]] is  in the context of [[K-theory]] from isomorphism classes of vector bundles on a space by the introduction of formal inverses, 'virtual bundles'.  This constructs an Abelian group from the semi-group of isomorphism classes.
