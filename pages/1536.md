# Idea #

In any context it is of interest to ask which kind of [[morphism]]s $p : C \to D$ arise as [[pullback]]s along a classifying morphism $S_p : D \to U$ to some universal object $U$ of some universal morphism $p_{univ} : \hat U \to U$.

The Grothendieck construction describes this in the context of [[Cat]]: a morphism $p : C \to D$ of [[category|categories]] -- i.e. a [[functor]] -- is called a [[fibered category]] or [[Grothendieck fibration]] if it is encoded in a [[pseudofunctor]] $S_p : D \to Cat$.

The reconstruction of $p$ from the pseudofunctor $S_p$ is the Grothendieck construction.


## Generalizations ##

The analog of the Grothendieck construction for [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] is described at [[Cartesian fibration]] and at [[universal fibration of (∞,1)-categories]].


## Warning on terminology ##

The term 'Grothendieck Construction' is applied in the literature to at least two very different constructions (and as [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] introduced so many new ideas and constructions to mathematics, perhaps there are others!). One concerns the construction of a [[fibered category]] from a [[pseudofunctor]] and will be treated in more detail in the entry on [[Grothendieck fibration]].  The other referes to constructing the [[Grothendieck group]] is  in the context of [[K-theory]] from isomorphism classes of vector bundles on a space by the introduction of formal inverses, 'virtual bundles'.  This constructs an Abelian group from the semi-group of isomorphism classes.
