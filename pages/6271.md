## Idea

__Borel\'s Theorem__ (also called _Borel\'s Lemma_) says that every [[power series]] is the [[Taylor series]] of some [[smooth function]]. In other words: for every collection of prescribed [[partial derivatives]] at some point, there is a smooth function having these as its actual derivatives.


## Statements

+-- {: .num_theorem #basic}
###### Theorem

The canonical map from the ring of germs of $C^\infty$ function at $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to the ring of formal power series obtained by taking the Taylor series at $0$ is surjective.
=--

There are many extensions and variants. 


For $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ a [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] $n+m \in \mathbb{N}$, write $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})$ for the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth function]]s with values in $\mathbb{R}$.

Write $m^\infty_{\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}} \subset C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})$ for the ideal of functions all whose [[partial derivative]]s along $\mathbb{R}^m$ vanish.

###### Theorem

Forming the [[Taylor series]] constitutes an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})/m^\infty_{\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) [ [ Y_1, \cdots, Y_m] ]
$$

between smooth functions modulo those whose derivatives along $\mathbb{R}^m$ vanish and the ring of [[power series]] in $m$-variables over $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

This appears for instance as ([Moerdijk-Reyes, theorem I.1.3](#MoerdijkReyes)).


## Proof

There is a full proof in Moerdijk--Reyes, cited above.  Here we prove Theorem \ref{basic} to indicate the method; the general version is not substantially different.  (This is based on the proof in [the English Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%27s_lemma) at the time of writing, but with more details.)

###### Proof (of Theorem \ref{basic})

A real [[power series]] at $0$ is given simply by an [[infinite sequence]] $c = (c_n)_{n\geq{0}}$ of [[real numbers]].  Given such a sequence, we would ideally use
$$ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n ,$$
but this is only correct if the sum converges on at least some [[neighbourhood]] of $0$ (in other words if the power series has a positive [[radius of convergence]]).

To ensure this, let $\psi$ be a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[bump function]] chosen so that $\psi(x) = 1$ for ${|x|} \leq 1$ and $\psi(x) = 0$ for ${|x|} \geq 2$.  (For example, $\psi(x) = \frac{\phi(x + 2)} {\phi(x + 2) + \phi(-x - 1)} \frac{\phi(-x + 2)} {\phi(-x + 2) + \phi(x - 1)}$, where $\phi(x)$ is $\exp(-1/x)$ when $x \gt 0$ and otherwise vanishes.)  Next, choose an infinite sequence $H = (H_n)_{n\geq{1}}$ of positive finite numbers:
$$ H_n = \max_{0\leq{k}\lt{n}} \max_{0\leq{i}\leq{k}} \root{n-k} {2^{2n-i} (k + 1) n^{\underline{k}} k^{\underline{i}} i!^{-1} {|c_n|} {\|\psi^{(k-i)}\|_\infty}} $$
(where $n^{\underline{k}}$ is the [[falling power]] $\prod_{0\leq{i}\lt{k}} (n - i)$, as discussed at [[binomial theorem]], including the special case $m! = m^{\underline{m}}$); also, let $H_0 = 0$ (the [[bottom element]] of $[0,\infty]$, since $0 \leq k \lt 0$ never occurs).  Finally, define
$$ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n \psi(H_n x) x^n .$$

If things go well, the derivatives of $f$ will be
$$ f^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k i!^{-1} k^{\underline{i}} n^{\underline{i}} c_n H_n^{k-i} \psi^{(k-i)}(H_n x) x^{n-i} ,$$
and I claim that this is so.  Since $H_n x = 0$ for ${|x|} \geq 2/H_n$, we have
$$ {\|f^{(k)}\|_\infty} \leq \sum_{n=k}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k i!^{-1} k^{\underline{i}} n^{\underline{i}} {|c_n|} H_n^{k-i} {\|psi^{(k-i)}\|_\infty} (2/H_n)^{n-i} \leq \sum_{n=k}^\infty (k + 1) \max_{0\leq{i}\leq{k} i!^{-1} k^{\underline{i}} n^{\underline{i}} {|c_n|} {\|psi^{(k-i)}\|_\infty} 2^{n-i}/H_n^{n-k} \leq (k + 1) \max_{0\leq{i}\leq{k} i!^{-1} k^{\underline{i}} k^{\underline{i}} {|c_n|} {\|psi^{(k-i)}\|_\infty} 2^{k-i} + \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty 2^{-n} ,$$
which is finite.  This proves [[uniform convergence]] of each claimed derivative (although not equiconvergence of all at once), and so each series not only converges but also may be antidifferentiated term by term, proving that $f^{(k)}$ is as claimed.

Finally because $\psi^(k)(0) = 0$ for $k \gt 0$ but $\psi(0) = 1$, and the same goes for $0^k$),
$$ f^{(k)}(0) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k i!^{-1} k^{\underline{i}} n^{\underline{i}} c_n H_n^{k-i} \psi^{(k-i)}(0) 0^{n-i} = k!^{-1} k! k! c_k H_k^0 \psi(0) 0^0 = k! c_k ,$$
making $c_k$ the $k$th coefficient of the Taylor series of $f$ at $0$, as desired.
