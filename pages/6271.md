## Idea

__Borel\'s Theorem__ (also called _Borel\'s Lemma_) says that every [[power series]] is the [[Taylor series]] of some [[smooth function]]. In other words: for every collection of prescribed [[partial derivatives]] at some point, there is a smooth function having these as actual partial derivatives.


## Statements

+-- {: .num_theorem #basic}
###### Theorem

The canonical map from the ring of germs of $C^\infty$ function at $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to the ring of formal power series obtained by taking the Taylor series at $0$ is surjective.
=--

There are many extensions and variants. 


For $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ a [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] $n+m \in \mathbb{N}$, write $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})$ for the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth function]]s with values in $\mathbb{R}$.

Write $m^\infty_{\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}} \subset C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})$ for the ideal of functions all whose [[partial derivative]]s along $\mathbb{R}^m$ vanish.

###### Theorem

Forming the [[Taylor series]] constitutes an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})/m^\infty_{\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) [ [ Y_1, \cdots, Y_m] ]
$$

between smooth functions modulo those whose derivatives along $\mathbb{R}^m$ vanish and the ring of [[power series]] in $m$-variables over $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

This appears for instance as ([Moerdijk-Reyes, theorem I.1.3](#MoerdijkReyes)).


## Proof

There is a full proof in Moerdijk--Reyes, cited above.  Here we prove Theorem \ref{basic} to indicate the method; the general version is not substantially different.  (This is based on the proof in [the English Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%27s_lemma) at the time of writing, but with more details.)

###### Proof (of Theorem \ref{basic})

A real [[power series]] at $0$ is given simply by an [[infinite sequence]] $c = (c_n)_{n\geq{0}}$ of [[real numbers]].  Given such a sequence, we would ideally use
$$ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n ,$$
but this is only correct if the sum converges on at least some [[neighbourhood]] of $0$ (in other words if the power series has a positive [[radius of convergence]]).

To ensure this, let $\psi$ be a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[bump function]] chosen so that $\psi(x) = 1$ for ${|x|} \leq 1$ and $\psi(x) = 0$ for ${|x|} \geq 2$.  (For example, $\psi(x) = \frac{\phi(x + 2)} {\phi(x + 2) + \phi(-x - 1)} \frac{\phi(-x + 2)} {\phi(-x + 2) + \phi(x - 1)}$, where $\phi(x)$ is $\exp(-1/x)$ when $x \gt 0$ and otherwise vanishes.)  Next, choose an infinite sequence $H = (H_n)_{n\geq{1}}$:
$$ H_n = \max_{0\leq{k}\lt{n}/2} \root{n-2k} {2^{2n-k} n^{\underline{k}} {\|\psi^{(k)}\|_\infty}} $$
(where $n^{\underline{k}}$ is the [[falling power]] $\prod_{0\leq{i}\lt{k}} (n - i)$, as discussed at [[binomial theorem]]).  Finally, define
$$ f(x) = c_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n \psi(H_n x) x^n .$$
(The term $c_0$ is because, morally, $H_0 = 0$.)

{I still need to explain why this series converges for all $x$ (and has the desired derivatives at $0$).  It\'s also possible that I have miscalculated $H$, in which case I should discover so as I finish this.}
