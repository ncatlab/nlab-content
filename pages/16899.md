## Idea

The category of metric spaces with Lipschitz maps between them is not good enough from a categorical viewpoint: it has finite limits (the max pseudo-metric on the product) but not all finite colimits: the coproduct doesn't always exist. To overcome this difficulty, we will work with ind-bounded metric spaces, with Lipschitz maps between them (any metric space may be seen as the colimit of its bounded subsets).

The category of bounded metric spaces has all finite limits and colimits (the two terms of the coproduct may be fixed to be at distance $1$, and other limits and colimits are the usual ones). This implies (SGA IV) that its indization has all limits and colimits. The category of ind-bounded metric spaces may thus give a convenient setting for the development of a metric stable homotopy theory.

The mapping space between two ind-bounded metric spaces is not strictly speaking an $\mathbb{R}_+$-graded set, but it may be seen as an ind-$\mathbb{R}_+$-graded set.
