## Idea

An **exponentiable topos** is a generalization of the notion of an exponentiable [[locale]] and can be viewed as a (topological) "space" $X$ that behaves well with respect to the construction of mapping spaces $Y^X$. 

The concept generalizes to [[higher topos theory]].

## Definition

...

## Properties

The following theorem generalizes a result of [[Martin Hyland]] on expenentiable locales to Grothendieck toposes.

###### Theorem
A [[Grothendieck topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ is an exponentiable object in the 2-category of Grothendieck toposes and [[geometric morphisms]] iff $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[continuous category]].

=--

This result is due to Johnstone-Joyal ([19812](#JJ82)) and occurs as theorem 4.4.5 (p.748) of the [[Elephant]] ([Johnstone (2002)](#J02).


## Examples

* Since [[locally finitely presentable categories]] are [[continuous category|continuous]] and [[coherent topos|coherent toposes]] are locally finitely presentable (cf. Johnstone ([2002, p.915](#J02))) it follows that _coherent toposes are exponentiable_. This can be viewed as an avatar of the fact that locally compact topological spaces behave well with respect to mapping spaces.
