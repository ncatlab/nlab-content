## Idea

The (unitary) _Geometric nerve_ is the [[nerve]] operation on [[bicategories]]. It is a [[functor]] from [[BiCat]] to [[sSet]]. This notion is due to R. Steet. 

$$
  N : BiCat \to sSet
  \,.
$$

## Definition

We may think of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ as the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the categories free on non-empty finite linear graphs. This gives the canonical inclusion $\Delta \hookrightarrow Cat$ that defines the ordinary nerve of categories. 

There is also the canonical embedding of categories into bicategories. Combined this gives the inclusion 

$$
  \Delta \hookrightarrow Cat \hookrightarrow BiCat
  \,.
$$

The bicategorical nerve is the nerve induced from that. So far $C$ a bicategory we have

$$
  N(C) : [k] \mapsto Hom_{NLax}(\Delta[k], C)
  \,.
$$
where $Hon_{NLax}$ is taking the _normal lax 2-functors_ as morphisms:
these are the lax 2-functors which strictly preserve identities. There are also an oplax version and non-normalized version.
 
## Properties

* The [[simplicial set]]s in the image of the geometric nerve are 3-[[coskeletal]].

* The geometric nerve identifies precisely [[bigroupoid]]s with 2-[[hypergroupoid]]s: those [[Kan complexes]] for which the horn fillers in dimension $\geq 3$ are _unique_ . 

  (Theorem 8.6 in ([Duskin](#Duskin)))  

  (This shows in particular that bigroupoids model all [[homotopy 2-type]]s.)


## Example

Any [[strict 2-category]] determines both a 'bicategory' in the above sense (since a 'strict' thing is also a 'weak' one)  and a simplicially enriched category.  The latter is found by taking the nerve of each 'hom-category'.  The Duskin nerve of a 2-category is the same as the [[homotopy coherent nerve]] of the corresponding $sSet$-category.  This can also be applied to [[2-groupoid]]s and results in a classifying space construction for [[crossed module]]s.
