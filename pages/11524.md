## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] and $G$ a [[group]] [[action|acting]] on it, then the _Borel equivariant cohomology_ of $X$ is the [[cohomology]] of the [[homotopy quotient]] $X//G$.

Since a standard way to model the [[homotopy quotient]] is the _[[Borel construction]]_, this is called _Borel equivariant cohomology_.

This is the special case of genuine [[equivariant cohomology]] where the [[action]] on the [[coefficienty]] is trivial.
