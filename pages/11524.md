## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] and $G$ a [[group]] [[action|acting]] on it, then the _Borel equivariant cohomology_ of $X$ is the [[cohomology]] of the [[homotopy quotient]] $X//G$.

Since a standard way to model the [[homotopy quotient]] is the _[[Borel construction]]_, this is called _Borel equivariant cohomology_.

This is the special case of genuine [[equivariant cohomology]] where the [[action]] on the coefficients is trivial.

## Properties

### As right induced genuine equivariant cohomology
  {#AsRightInducedGenuineEquivariantCohomology}


In the more general context of ([[global equivariant stable homotopy theory|global]]) [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]], Borel-[[equivariant spectra]] are those which are _right induced_ from plain [[spectra]], hence which are in the [[essential image]] of the [[right adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from [[equivariant spectra]] to plain [[spectra]].
