A __boolean function__ of $n$ variables is a [[function]] from $\mathbb{B}^n$ to $\mathbb{B}$, where $\mathbb{B}$ is the [[boolean domain]].  Compare a [[boolean-valued function]], where $\mathbb{B}^n$ may be replaced by any set $X$.

The logical operations in [[classical logic]] may all be interpreted as boolean functions, given by their truth tables.
