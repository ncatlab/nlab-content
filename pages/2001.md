A homomorphism of (not necessarily commutative nor unital) [[rings]] $u:R\to S$ is __flat__ if the extension of scalars (= [[inverse image]]) functor $u^*:R Mod\to S Mod$, $M\mapsto S\otimes_R M$ is an [[exact functor|exact]] [[additive functor]]. Recall that every extension of scalars functor for modules is cocontinuous and a fortiori admits a right adjoint. Hence this definition is in an agreement with the more general notion of a [[flat functor]] in category and topos theory.

If one pictures a morphism as a family, then for many purposes good families are flat (e.g. in deformation theory). 

A morphism $f:X\to Y$ of schemes is __flat__ if the induced map on stalks is flat morphism of (commutative unital) rings. Given a base scheme $S$, the slice category $Sch/S$ of schemes over $S$ is equipped with several _flat topologies_. These are the [[Grothendieck topologies]] in which covers consist of flat morphisms which set-theoretically cover the target scheme with some additional finiteness conditions. The usual choices are the fppf (fr. _fidèlement plat de presentation finie_, 'faithfully flat and of finite presentation') and fpqc (fr. _fidèlement plat e quasicompacte_, 'faithfully flat and quasicompact') topologies.
