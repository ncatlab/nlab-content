A **strict factorization system** is like an [[orthogonal factorization system]], but the factorizations are specified uniquely on the nose, rather than merely up to isomorphism.

One reason these are of interest is that they can be identified with [[distributive laws]] in the [[bicategory]] of [[spans]], as shown in

* R. Rosebrugh and R. J. Wood, [Distributive Laws and Factorization](http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/articles/fac.pdf).

Ordinary orthogonal factorization systems can be similarly characterized by:

* using a type of [[pseudo distributive law]], as in the above paper;

* by working in the bicategory of [[profunctors]] instead, as in [this paper](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/13/9/13-09abs.html) (see also [[factorization system over a subcategory]]); or by

* using [[weak distributive law]]s, as in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0732).
