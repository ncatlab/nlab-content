Truesdell championed an [[axiom|axiomatic]] approach to [[continuum physics]]/[[irreversible thermodynamics]] which goes by the name "[[rational thermodynamics]]". Exposure to this axiomatic approach partly motivated the development of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and [[cohesion]] by his student [[William Lawvere]] (see there for more) as a [[foundations]] for [[continuum mechanics]].
