## Idea

_Physics_ studies the constituting mechanisms of the [[observable universe]]. 

Since [[Newton]] laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called _[[Newton's laws of physics]]_, distinguishing it from the earlier _[[natural philosophy]]_, physics is specifically concerned with modelling observed [[phenomenology]] by "physical laws" formulated in the language of [[mathematics]]. The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to _fundamental physics_ (e.g. [[fundamental particles]]) and away from [[complex systems]] or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies [[statistical physics|statistical]] aspects in [[statistical physics]].

The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in [[models (in theoretical physics)]] called

1. the [[standard model of particle physics]]

1. the [[standard model of cosmology]];

which are formulated in the two fundamental [[theories]] called

1. [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills]]-[[gauge theory]] 

1. [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]]

which in turn are both instances of the general framework of [[classical field theory|classical]]/[[quantum field theory]].

Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical "toy"- and test-case [[models (in theoretical physics)]], exploring the "space of physical theories", and parts of [[mathematical physics]] overlaps with pure [[mathematics]], the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about [[phenomenology]].
