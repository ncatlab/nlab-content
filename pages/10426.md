## Idea

As [[geometric type theory]] refers to a conjectural extension of [[geometric logic]] to an [[extensional type theory|extensional]] dependent [[type theory]] that corresponds to [[sheaf toposes]] (under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]]) with [[geometric morphisms]] between them, a similar conjectural extension to a [[homotopy type theory]] corresponding to [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (and geometric morphisms) maybe deserves to be called _geometric homotopy type theory_.

Since hcolims are preserved by inverse images of geometric morphisms, this type theory is likely to include [[higher inductive types]].

Traditionally the [[types]] in geometric homotopy type theory, hence the _geometric homotopy types_, are known as _[[∞-stacks]]_ and maybe better as _[[(∞,1)-sheaves]]_, notably as _[[moduli ∞-stacks]]_.
