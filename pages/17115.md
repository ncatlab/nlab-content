## Idea

S-modules are one version of [[highly structured spectra]] that support a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].


The [[category]] of _S-modules_ ([EKMM 97](#EKMM97)) is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra|of spectra]], with the special property that it implements the [[smash product of spectra]] such as to yield itself a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal model category|monoidal]] [[model category of spectra]]: the _[[model structure on symmetric spectra]]_. This implies in particular that with respect to this [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] an [[E-∞ ring]] is presented simply as a plain [[commutative monoid]] [[internalization|in]] S-modules.

Other presentations sharing this property are _[[symmetric spectra]]_ and _[[orthogonal spectra]]_.

## Construction

The construction of [[S-modules]] by ([EKMM 97](#EKMM97)) begins with the notion of [[coordinate-free spectrum|coordinate free Lewis-May spectra]].  Using the [[linear isometries operad]], one can construct a [[monad]] $\mathbb{L}$ on the category $\mathcal{S}$ of such spectra, and the category of $\mathbb{L}$-algebras is a well-behaved model for the stable homotopy category, and moreover admits a smash product which is associative up to isomorphism, but unital only up to weak equivalence.  However, the subcategory of the $\mathbb{L}$-algebras for which the unit transformations are isomorphisms is again a well-behaved model for $Ho \mathbb{S}$, which is moreover symmetric monoidal.

Since the unit transformation is of the form $S\wedge E \to E$, where $S$ is the [[sphere spectrum]], and this map looks like the action of a ring on a module, the objects of this subcategory are called **$S$-modules** and the category is called $Mod_S$.  The intuition is that just as an abelian group is a [[module]] over the archetypical ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integer|integers]], a spectrum should be regarded as a module over the archetypal ring spectrum, namely the sphere spectrum.

Similarly, just as an ordinary [[ring]] is a [[monoid]] in the category $Mod_\mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[module]]s, i.e. a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, an $A_\infty$ or $E_\infty$ ring spectrum is a (possibly commutative) monoid in the category of $S$-modules, and thus referred to as an **$S$-algebra**.  More generally, for any $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-ring|ring spectrum]] $R$, there is a notion of $R$-[[module]] spectra forming a category $Mod_R$, which in turn carries an associative and commutative smash product $\wedge_R$ and a [[model category]] structure on $Mod_R$ such that $\wedge_R$ becomes unital in the [[homotopy category]].  All this is such that an $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebra]] over $R$ is a [[monoid object]] in $(Mod_R, \wedge_R)$.  Similarly $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-algebra|algebras]] are commutative monoid objects in $(Mod_R, \wedge_R)$.
