
Analogously to a [[smooth space]], a __continuous space__ is any notion of [[space]] between which the [[morphisms]] are [[continuous maps]].  Examples include:

* [[convergence spaces]],
* [[topological spaces]],
* [[locales]].

Contrast this with, for example:

* [[uniform spaces]] (morphisms are [[uniformly continuous map]]s),
* [[smooth spaces]] (morphisms are [[smooth maps]]),
* (weak) [[homotopy types]] (objects are still (nice) topological spaces, but now morphisms are [[homotopy]] classes of continuous maps).
