## Idea

In the context of [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]] and its variants, such as [[supergravity]]) what are called _no-hair theorems_ are statements saying that or to which extent [[black hole]] [[spacetimes]] and more generally [[black brane]] spacetimes are characterized by their [[mass]], [[angular momentum]] and [[charge]], hence that they look much like macroscopic [[fundamental particles]] or fundamental [[branes]] ("[[black branes]]").

## Examples

### In 4d Einstein-Maxwell theory

The archetypical example is 4-dimensional [[Einstein-Maxwell theory]], where the no-hair theorem asserts that all [[black hole]] solutions are entirely characterized by their [[mass]], [[angular momentum]] and [[electric charge]].

### In 4d Einstein-Yang-Mills theory

Generalizing to 4-dimensional [[Einstein-Yang-Mills theory]] with [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[gauge group]], the situation becomes much more subtle. (...)
