## Idea

The process of [[quantization]] is supposed to assign to a [[classical field theory]] ([[prequantum field theory]]) a corresponding [[quantum field theory]]. One tends to imagine that in some cases the resulting QFT can itself be regarded as a classical field theory, roughly, and the process of quantization be applied again. One then speaks of _second quantization_ . 

In its simplest form the _free_ second quantization (in the sense of [[free field theory]], introducing no [[interaction]] between the second quantized quanta) is identified with the _[[Fock space]]_ construction on a given [[space of quantum states]].

For interacting second quantization see _[[sigma-model -- exposition of second quantization of sigma-models]]_.

## Properties

### Syntax in linear type theory

In [[linear type theory]], which may be regarded as [[quantum logic]] (by the discussion there), the [[Fock space]] construction may naturally be identified with the [[exponential modality]]. See there for more.
