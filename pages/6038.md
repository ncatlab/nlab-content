The process of [[quantization]] is supposed to assign to a [[classical field theory]] a corresponding [[quantum field theory]]. One tends to imagine that in some cases the resulting QFT can itself be regarded as a classical field theory, roughly, and the process of quantization be applied again. One then speaks of _second quantization_ .
