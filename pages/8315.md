##Idea

Cellular homology is a very efficient tool for computing the [[ordinary homology|ordinary]] [[homology groups]] of [[CW complexes]], based on degree calculations. It uses the combinatorial structure of a CW-complex to define, first a complex of celluar chains and then the corresponding [[homology]]. (There is a related cellular cohomology.)  The cellular homology of a CW-complex is isomorphic to its [[singular homology]].

## Definition 

Recall that a CW complex is a [[topological space]] $X$ presented inductively by taking the [[colimit]] in [[Top]] of a sequence of inclusions 

$$X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow X_2 \hookrightarrow \ldots$$ 

where each $X_n$ is obtained from $X_{n-1}$ by attaching $n$-disks. 

In [[ordinary homology]] with $\mathbb{Z}$ [[coefficients]] (which can easily be relativized to include other coefficient groups), form a [[chain complex]], the **cellular chain complex**, whose terms are [[relative homology]] groups $H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})$, and where the [[differential]]

\[ d_n \colon H_{n+1}(X_{n+1}, X_n) \to H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})\]

is the composition 

$$H_{n+1}(X_{n+1}, X_n) \stackrel{\partial_n}{\to} H_n(X_n) \stackrel{i_n}{\to} H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})$$ 

where $\partial_n$ is a boundary map and $i_n$ is induced from the inclusion of pairs $(X_n, \emptyset) \to (X_n, X_{n-1})$. 

Using the [[Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms]], one can easily prove the following results.

###### Proposition 
The composition $d_{n-1} \circ d_n$ of two differentials as defined above is zero.

## Properties

### Cellular chains

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})$ is a [[free abelian group]] whose set of [[basis]] elements is the set of $n$-[[disks]] attached to $X_{n-1}$ to yield $X_n$.

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

Thus, each differential $d_n$ can be described as a [[matrix]] $M$ with [[integer]] entries $M_{i j}$. Here an index $j$ refers to the attaching map $f_j \colon S^n \to X_n$ for the $j^{th}$ disk $D^{n+1}$. The integer entry $M_{i j}$ corresponds to a map 

$$\mathbb{Z} \cong H_{n+1}(D^{n+1}, S^n) \to H_n(S^n) \to H_n(D^n, S^{n-1}) \cong H_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$ 

and is computed as the [[degree of a continuous function]]

$$S^n \stackrel{f_j}{\to} X_n \to X_n/(X_n - D^n) \cong D^n/S^{n-1} \cong S^n$$ 

where the inclusion $X_n - D^n \hookrightarrow X_n$ corresponds to the attaching map for the $i^{th}$ disk $D^n$.

### Cellular homology groups

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
The homology group $H_n(X)$ of the CW complex $X$ is isomorphic to the homology of the cellular chain complex at the component $H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})$. 
=-- 

### Via spectral sequences

The given structure of a [[filtered topological space]] $\cdots \hookrightarrow X_p \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X $ induces the structure of a [[filtered chain complex]] on the [[singular homology]] complex $C_\bullet(X)$

$$
  F_p C_\bullet(X) \coloneqq C_\bullet(X_p)
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] converges to the cellular homology. See there for more details.
