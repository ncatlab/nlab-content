Cellular homology is a very efficient tool for computing the homology groups of 
CW complexes, based on degree calculations. It uses the combinatorial structure of a CW-complex to define, first a complex of celluar chains and then the corresponding [[homology]]. (There is a related cellular cohomology.)  The cellular homology of a CW-complex is isomorphic to its [[singular homology]].
