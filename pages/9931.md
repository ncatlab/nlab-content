## Idea

The [[moduli stack of formal groups]] $\mathcal{M}_{FG}$ admits a natural [[stratification]] whose open [[strata]] are labeled by a [[natural number]] called the _height_ of formal groups.

The [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] associated to these [[formal groups]] by the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]] accordingly also inherit such an integer label, called _[[chromatic filtration]]_. Studying this is the topic of [[chromatic homotopy theory]].

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and fix 

$$
  f(x,y) \in R [ [ x,y ] ]
$$ 

a [[formal group law]] over $R$.

###### Definition

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the **$n$-series** of $f$ 

$$
  [n](t) \in R[ [ t ] ] 
$$

is defined [[recursion|recursively]] by

1. if $n = 0$ then $[n](t) = 0$;

1. if $n \gt 0$ then $[n](t) = f([n-1](t),t)$.

Now fix $p \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[prime number]], 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $v_n$ for the [[coefficient]] of $t^{p^n}$ in the $p$-series $[p]$ of $f$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Say that $f$

* has **height** $\geq n$ if $v_i = 0$ for $i \lt n$;

* has **height exactly** $n$ if it has height $\geq n$ and $v_n \in R$ is invertible.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $f(x,y) = x + y + x y$ the [[formal multiplicative group]] the $n$-series is 

$$
  [n](t) = (1+t)^n - 1
  \,.
$$

If $p = 0$ in $R$ then 

$$
  [p](t) = (1+t)^p - 1 = t^p
$$ 

and thus $f$ has height exactly 1.

###### Example

An [[elliptic curve]] over a [[field]] of [[positive number|positive]] [[characteristic]] whose [[formal group law]] has [[height of a formal group]] equal to 2 is called a _[[supersingular elliptic curve]]_. Otherwise the height equals 1 and the elliptic curve is called _ordinary_.

## Properties

### Chromatic height filtation

The hight of formal groups induces the [[height filtration]] on the [[moduli stack of formal groups]].
