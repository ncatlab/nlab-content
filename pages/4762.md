## Idea 


An _$n$-hypergroupoid_ is a model for an [[n-groupoid]]: it is an [[Kan complex]] that is like the [[nerve]] of a [[groupoid]] ($n= 1$), [[bigroupoid]] ($n = 2$) etc.

## Definition

###### Definition

An **$n$-hypergroupoid** is a [[Kan complex]] $K$ in which the [[horn]]-fillers are _unique_ in dimension greater than $n$:

$$
  (k \gt n) \Rightarrow
  \left(
     \array{
       \Lambda^i[k] &\to&  K
       \\
       \downarrow & \nearrow_{\exists !}
       \\
       \Delta[k]
     }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

(The lower dimensional horn fillers of course also exist, but are not in general unique.)

This is due to ([Duskin 79](#Duskin79), [Glenn 82](#Glenn82)). In [Beke 04](#Beke04) these are called _exact $n$-types_ instead. For a review on the definition see ([Pridham 09, section 2](#Pridham09)).

Equivalently, this are those [[Kan complex]]es which are $(n+1)$-[[coskeletal]] and such that the $(n+1)$-horns and $(n+2)$-horns have unique fillers.

###### Remark

## Properties

* 1-hypergroupoids are precisely the [[nerve]]s of [[groupoid]]s.

* 2-hypergroupoids are precisely the [[Duskin nerve]]s of [[bigroupoids]].
