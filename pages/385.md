## Idea 

The _Crans-Gray tensor product_ is a [[tensor product]] on the category of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] which is analogous to (the lax version of) the [[Gray tensor product]] for 2-categories.

This tensor product makes the category $Str\omega Cat$ of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] into a (non-symmetric) [[closed monoidal category|biclosed monoidal structure]]; thus in particular it has two internal-homs $Hom_r$ and $Hom_l$.  Both contain strict $\omega$-functors as their objects, and their $k$-cells for $k\gt 0$ are [[k-transfors]] which are lax or oplax in all dimensions (one internal-hom contains lax transfors and the other the oplax ones).


## Construction from cubical sets 

One abstract way to construct the Crans-Gray tensor product is as follows.

There is an obvious [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] on the [[cube category]] obtained from the obvious product of cellular [[geometric shapes for higher structures|cubes]] which is analogous to the cartesian product of the topological cubes $[0,1]^n$.  By [[Day convolution]] this naturally indces a [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] on [[cubical set|cubical sets]].

Now strict $\omega$-categories, although usually defined as [[globular set|globular sets]] with extra structure, can also be regarded as [[cubical set|cubical sets]] with extra structure.  More precisely, there is a forgetful functor from $Str\omega Cat$ to $CubSet$ which is [[monadic functor|monadic]], and the monad is a [[monoidal monad]].  It follows by further general results of Day that the tensor product on $CubSet$ lifts to $Str\omega Cat$.

It is also possible to give a direct construction of this tensor product; see Crans' thesis below.


## Relation to the Gray tensor product 

Strict $n$-categories for $n\lt\omega$ can of course be regarded as strict $\omega$-categories with all $k$-cells identities for $k\gt n$.   In general, the Crans-Gray tensor product of an $n$-category with an $m$-category will be an $(n+m)$-category, since the tensor product of the $n$-cube and the $m$-cube is the $(n+m)$-cube.  (Compare, for example, the fact that the [[Gray tensor product]] of two 1-categories is no longer, in general, a 1-category.)

However, we can obtain a tensor product on strict $n$-categories for any $n$ by applying the [[reflector]] (or "cotruncation") functor for the inclusion of strict $n$-categories into strict $\omega$-categories.  When $n=1$, this produces the cartesian product of categories, while when $n=2$ it reproduces the lax version of the [[Gray tensor product]].

Sjoerd Crans has also defined a tensor product *of* [[Gray-categories]], but the relationship between it and the tensor product of strict $\omega$-categories is not entirely clear, since neither $Str\omega Cat$ nor $GrayCat$ contains the other (their "intersection" is $Str3Cat$).


## Properties 

The Crans-Gray tensor product makes $Str\omega Cat$ into a bi[[closed monoidal category]]. So in particular for $X, Y \in \omega Cat$ two strict $\omega$-categories, the $\omega$-[[functor category]] between them is

$$
   [X,Y] = \omega Cat( X \otimes G^\bullet, Y)
  \,,
$$

where $\otimes$ is the CG-tensor product and $G^\bullet : G \to \omega Cat$ is the  [[globular set|globular]] object of standard [[globe]]s. The objects in $[X,Y]$ are the $\omega$-functors. The [[k-morphism]]s are the $k$-[[transfor]]s between these.

## Further Remarks 

* The Crans-Gray tensor product extends the tensor product  on strict $\omega$-groupoids given by R. Brown and P.J. Higgins (see below); they construct a symmetric monoidal closed structure on these $\omega$-groupoids. 

* The article ([BrownHiggins](#BrownHiggins)) sets up an equivalence between globular $\omega$-categories and certain cubical $\omega$-categories with [[connection]]s, to which the monoidal closed structure in the previous paper is easily extended. 

* There is the [[Verity-Gray tensor product]] on [[stratified simplicial set]]s (as described there). Via the [[oriental|omega-nerve]] [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] form the [[complicial set]]s within all [[stratified simplicial set]]s. According to observation 60 of [Verity06](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604414) section 11.4 of [Verity04](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410412) proves that the Crans-Gray tensor product is the reflection of the Verity-Gray tensor product under this inclusion.
