A _factorization algebra_ is like an [[algebra over an operad]] where the [[operad]] in question is like the [[little disks operad]], but with each disk embedded into a given manifold $X$.

This way a factorization algebra is an assignment of a [[object]] (in the standard case a vector space) $V_D$ to each ball $D \subset X$ embedded in $X$, and for each collection of non-intersecting embedded balls $D_1 , \cdots, D_n \subset D \subset X$ sitting inside a bigger embedded ball $D$ in $X$ a morphism

$$
  V_{D_1} \otimes V_{D_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V_{D_n} \to V_{D}
$$

such that for every collection of further nested balls inside balls, all the different ways to bracket

$$
  V_{D_{11}} \otimes V_{D_{12}} \otimes \cdots \otimes V_{D_{1 n}}
  \otimes V_{D_{21}} \otimes V_{D_{2 2}} \otimes \cdots \to V_D
  \,.
$$

This is pretty much like saying that the factorization algebra is an extended [[FQFT]] of genus 0 [[cobordism]]s that are embedded into $X$.

Indeed, such factorization algebras serve to describe [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] on $X$, pretty much in a way that generalizes the familiar way that 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory]] is given by [[vertex operator algebra]]s. See also the comments on the references below.

This may be regarded as a slight variation on the concept _chiral algebra_ originally introduced by Beilinson and Drinfeld.

A definition appears in section 4.1 _Topological Chiral Homology_ of

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]

There it is demonstrated how factorization algebras can be used to construct extended [[FQFT]]s.

Concrete constructions of formal algebras for familiar [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] are described in the work of Kevin Costello. This can be found mentioned in the talk notes of the [[Northwestern TFT Conference 2009]], see in particular

There seems to be a close relation between the description of [[quantum field theory]] by factorization algebras and the proposal presented in
