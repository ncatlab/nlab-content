## Idea

The _Steenrod-approximation theorem_ states mild conditions under which an extension of a [[smooth function]] on a [[closed subset]] by a [[continuous function]] may itself be improved to an extension by a smooth function.

This is a smooth enhancement of the [[Tietze extension theorem]].

## Statement


{#GeneralizedSteenrodTheorem}
+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem


Let $X$ be a finite [[dimension]]al [[connected]] [[smooth manifold]] [[manifold with corners|with corners]]. Let $\pi : E \to X$ be a locally trivial [[Diff|smooth]]  [[bundle]] with a [[locally convex]] [[manifold]] $N$ as typical [[fiber]] and $\sigma : X \to E$ a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[section]].

If $L \subset X$ is a [[closed subset]] and $U \subset X$ is an [[open subset]] such that $\sigma$ is [[smooth function|smooth]] in a [[neighbourhood]] of $L \setminus U$, then:

1. for each open neighbourhood $O$ of $\sigma(X)$ in $E$ there exists a section $\tau : X \to O$ 

   * which is smooth in a neighbourhood of $L$;

   * and which equals $\sigma$ on $X \setminus U$;

1. there exists a [[homotopy]] $F : [0,1] \times X \to O$ between $\sigma$ and $\tau$ such that

   * each $F(t,-)$ is a section of $\pi$;

   * for $(t,x) \in [0,1] \times (X \setminus U)$ we have $F(t,x) = \sigma(x) = \tau(x)$.

+-- {: .un_corollary}
###### Corollary

Let $f,g : Z \to Y$ be two [[smooth function]]s between [[smooth manifold]]s. Let  $\eta : Z \times [0,1] \to Y$ be a continuous [[delayed homotopy]] between them.

Then there exists also smooth homotopy between $f$ and $g$ which is itself continuously homotopic to $\eta$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


To apply the [generalized Steenrod theorem](#GeneralizedSteenrodTheorem) with the notation as stated there, makes the following identifications

* set $X := Z \times [0,1]$;

* set $N = Y$;

* let $E = Z \times [0,1] \times Y$ be the trivial $Z$-bundle over $X$

  (so a section of $E$ is nothing but a function $Z \times[0,1] \to Y$)

* let $(\sigma : X \to E) := (\eta : Z \times [0,1] \to Y)$ be the given continuous homotopy;

* set $L := Z \times \{0,1\}$;

* let $U := Z \times (0,1)$.

Then because by assumption $\eta$ is a continuous [[delayed homotopy]] between smooth functions, it follows that $\sigma$ is smooth in a neighbourhood $Z \times ([0,\epsilon) \coprod (1-\epsilon,1]$ of $L$.

So the theorem applies and provides a smooth  homotopy

$$
  \tau : [0,1] \times Z \to Y
$$

which moroever is itself (continuously) homotopic to $\eta$ via some continuous $F : [0,1] \times [0,1] \times Z \to Y$.
