## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let [[Ab]] be the collection of [[abelian groups]], regarded as a [[multicategory]] whose [[multimorphisms]] are the [[multilinear maps]] $A_1, \cdots, A_n \to B$.

The [[tensor product]] $A, B \mapsto A \otimes B$ in this multicategory is the **tensor product of abelian groups.

=--

Equivalently this means explicitly:

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitTensorProduct}
###### Definition

For $A, B$ two [[abelian groups]], their **tensor product of abelian groups** is an abelian group $A \otimes B$ obtained by

1. starting with the cartesian product $A\times B$ in sets,
1. generating a _[[free abelian group]] from it, and then
1. quotienting by [[generators and relations|relations]] $(a_1,b)+(a_2,b)\sim (a_1+a_2,b)$ and $(a,b_1)+(a,b_2)\sim (a,b_1+b_2)$.  


=--

(The 0-ary relations $(0,b)\sim 0$ and $(a,0)\sim 0$ follow automatically; one needs them explicitly only if one generalises to [[abelian monoids]].)

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A [[group homomorphism]] $A \otimes B \to C$ is a [[bilinear map]] $A \times B \to C$.

=--

## Properties

Equipped with the tensor product $\otimes$ of def. \ref{ExplicitTensorProduct} [[Ab]] becomes a [[monoidal category]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[monoid]] in $(Ab, \otimes)$ is equivalently a [[ring]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $(A, \cdot)$ be a [[monoid]] in $(Ab, \otimes)$. The fact that the multiplication

$$
  \cdot : A \otimes A \to A
$$

is bilinear means by the above that for all $a_1, a_2, b \in A$ we have

$$
  (a_1 +  a_2) \cdot b = a_1 \cdot b  + a_2 \cdot b
$$

and

$$
  b \cdot (a_1 +  a_2) = b \cdot a_1 + b \cdot a_2 
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the [[distributivity law]] of the ring.
