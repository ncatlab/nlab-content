### Recalling general 2-vector bundles

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], or more generally an [[E-∞ ring]]. By the discussion at [[2-vector space]] consider the [[2-category]]

$$
  2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$ 

[[equivalence of 2-categories|equivalent]] to that whose objects are [[associative algebras]] (or generally [[A-∞ algebra|algebras]]) $A$ over $R$, (being placeholders for the 2-vector space $A Mod$ which is the category of [[modules]] over $A$) whose [[1-morphisms]] are [[bimodules]] between these algebras (inducing linear functors between the corresponding 2-vector spaces = categories of modules) and whose [[2-morphisms]] are [[homomorphisms]] between those. 

Under [[Isbell duality]] and by the discussion at _[Modules -- as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction)_  we may think of this 2-category as being that of (generalized) 2-vector bundles over a [[space]] called $Spec R$.

### Line 2-bundles

The [[2-category]] $2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R$ is canonically a [[monoidal 2-category]]. An object in $2 Vect_R$ is a _[[line]]_ if it is an _invertible object_ with respect to this tensor product, hence if it is an _[[Azumaya algebra]]_. In terms of the above this means that it represents a 2-vector bundle over $Spec R$ which is a **line 2-bundle**.

The full inclusion

$$
  \mathbf{Br}(R) \hookrightarrow 2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$

of the maximal [[2-groupoid]] on the line 2-bundles over $Spec R$ is a [[braided 3-group]], the _[[Picard group|Picard 3-group]]_ of $Spec R$.  See _[Relation to Brauer group](#RelationToBrauerGroup)_ below for more.

## Properties

### Relation to Brauer group and Picard group
 {#RelationToBrauerGroup}

The [[braided 3-group]] $\mathbf{Br}(R)$ of line 2-bundles over $Spec R$ has as [[homotopy groups]]

* $\pi_0(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[Brauer group]] of $R$;

* $\pi_1(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[Picard group]] of $R$, hence the group of ordinary [[line bundles]] over $R$;

* $\pi_2(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[group of units]] of $R$.



## Examples

### Super line 2-bundles and twisted K-theory

We discuss line 2-bundles in [[supergeometry]] and their relation to [[twisted K-theory]]

###### Definition

Let $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq $ [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]] be the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of [[smooth super-∞-groupoids]]. With [[CartSp]]${}_{th}$ the [[site]] given by the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[supermanifolds]] on those of the form $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ for $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$ this is the corresponding [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]]

$$
  SmoothSuper\infty Grod \simeq Sh_\infty(CartSp_{th})
$$

This is cohesive over [[Super∞Grpd]] $ \simeq Sh_\infty(SuperPoints)$

$$
  \Gamma \colon SmoothSuper\infty Grpd  \to Super \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

Let $\mathbb{K} \in \mathbf{H}$ be the canocal [[affine line|affine]] [[line object]], whose underlying sheaf of sets assigns 

$$
  \mathbb{K} \colon \mathbb{R}^{p|q} \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathbb{C})\otimes (\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{C}^q)_{even}
 \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[[superalgebra]]_ we have that $\Gamma(\mathbb{K})$-algebras in [[Super∞Grpd]] are, externally, superalgebras over the [[complex numbers]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Defintion

Write

$$
  2\mathbf{sVect} \in SmoothSuper \infty Grpd
$$

for the object which over $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ is the [[2-groupoid]] whose 

* objects are semisimple $\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})$-algebras;

* [[1-morphisms]] are invertible [[bimodules]];

* [[2-morphisms]] are invertible bimodule homomorphisms.

This is naturally a [[braided monoidal 2-category]] object. Write

$$
 2 \mathbf{sLine} \in SmoothSuper \infty Grpd
$$

for the maximal [[braided 3-group]] inside this on the invertible objects.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The object $2\mathbf{sLine} \in SmoothSuper\infty Grpd$ is equivalent to that which to $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ assigns the 2-gorupoid with

* objects are the algebra $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathb{C})\otimes (\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{C}^q)_{even}$ and that algebra tensored with $Cl_1(\mathbb{C})$;

* morphisms are $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathb{C})\otimes (\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{C}^q)_{even}$ regarded as a bimodule over itself and that bimodule tensored with $Cl_1(\mathbb{C})$;

* 2-morphisms form the group $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathbb{C}^\times)$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is the straightforward generalization of the discussion at  _[superalgebra -- Picard 2-groupoid](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/super+algebra#Picard2Groupoid)_ from superalgebras over $\mathbb{C}$ to those over $C^\infty(\mathbb7R}^p, \mathbb{C})$.

The invertible $\mathbb{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R})$-algebras are equivalent to that algebra itself. The invertible superalgebras are the ground field and $Cl_1(\mathbb{C})$. Similarly for the invertible bimodules. Finally the inverticle intertwiners are pointwise $\mathbb{C}^\times$.
