## Definition

### Recalling general 2-vector bundles

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], or more generally an [[E-∞ ring]]. By the discussion at [[2-vector space]] consider the [[2-category]]

$$
  2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$ 

[[equivalence of 2-categories|equivalent]] to that whose objects are [[associative algebras]] (or generally [[A-∞ algebra|algebras]]) $A$ over $R$, (being placeholders for the 2-vector space $A Mod$ which is the category of [[modules]] over $A$) whose [[1-morphisms]] are [[bimodules]] between these algebras (inducing linear functors between the corresponding 2-vector spaces = categories of modules) and whose [[2-morphisms]] are [[homomorphisms]] between those. 

Under [[Isbell duality]] and by the discussion at _[Modules -- as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction)_  we may think of this 2-category as being that of (generalized) 2-vector bundles over a [[space]] called $Spec R$.

### Line 2-bundles

The [[2-category]] $2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R$ is canonically a [[monoidal 2-category]]. An object in $2 Vect_R$ is a _[[line]]_ if it is an _invertible object_ with respect to this tensor product, hence if it is an _[[Azumaya algebra]]_. In terms of the above this means that it represents a 2-vector bundle over $Spec R$ which is a **line 2-bundle**.

The full inclusion

$$
  \mathbf{Br}(R) \hookrightarrow 2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$

of the maximal [[2-groupoid]] on the line 2-bundles over $Spec R$ is a [[braided 3-group]], the _[[Picard group|Picard 3-group]]_ of $Spec R$.  See _[Relation to Brauer group](#RelationToBrauerGroup)_ below for more.

## Properties

### Relation to Brauer group and Picard group
 {#RelationToBrauerGroup}

The [[braided 3-group]] $\mathbf{Br}(R)$ of line 2-bundles over $Spec R$ has as [[homotopy groups]]

* $\pi_0(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[Brauer group]] of $R$;

* $\pi_1(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[Picard group]] of $R$, hence the group of ordinary [[line bundles]] over $R$;

* $\pi_2(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[group of units]] of $R$.
