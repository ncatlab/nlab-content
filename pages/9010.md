## Definition

### Recalling general 2-vector bundles

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], or more generally an [[E-∞ ring]]. By the discussion at [[2-vector space]] consider the [[2-category]]

$$
  2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$ 

[[equivalence of 2-categories|equivalent]] to that whose objects are [[associative algebras]] (or generally [[A-∞ algebra|algebras]]) $A$ over $R$, (being placeholders for the 2-vector space $A Mod$ which is the category of [[modules]] over $A$) whose [[1-morphisms]] are [[bimodules]] between these algebras (inducing linear functors between the corresponding 2-vector spaces = categories of modules) and whose [[2-morphisms]] are [[homomorphisms]] between those. 

Under [[Isbell duality]] and by the discussion at _[Modules -- as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction)_  we may think of this 2-category as being that of (generalized) 2-vector bundles over a [[space]] called $Spec R$.

### Line 2-bundles

The [[2-category]] $2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R$ is canonically a [[monoidal 2-category]]. An object in $2 Vect_R$ is a _[[line]]_ if it is an _invertible object_ with respect to this tensor product, hence if it is an _[[Azumaya algebra]]_. In terms of the above this means that it represents a 2-vector bundle over $Spec R$ which is a **line 2-bundle**.

The full inclusion

$$
  \mathbf{Br}(R) \hookrightarrow 2 Vect_R \simeq Alg_R
$$

of the maximal [[2-groupoid]] on the line 2-bundles over $Spec R$ is a [[braided 3-group]], the _[[Picard group|Picard 3-group]]_ of $Spec R$.  See _[Relation to Brauer group](#RelationToBrauerGroup)_ below for more.

## Properties

### Relation to Brauer group and Picard group
 {#RelationToBrauerGroup}

The [[braided 3-group]] $\mathbf{Br}(R)$ of line 2-bundles over $Spec R$ has as [[homotopy groups]]

* $\pi_0(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[Brauer group]] of $R$;

* $\pi_1(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[Picard group]] of $R$, hence the group of ordinary [[line bundles]] over $R$;

* $\pi_2(\mathbf{Br}(R))$ the [[group of units]] of $R$.



## Examples

### Super line 2-bundles and twisted K-theory
 {#SuperLine2BundlesAndTwistedK}

We discuss line 2-bundles in [[supergeometry]] and their relation to [[twisted K-theory]]. This follows the discussion in chapter 1 of ([Freed](#Freed)), which in turn follows the classical text ([Donovan-Karoubi](#DonovanKaroubi)) on [[twisted K-theory]] and ([Wall](#Wall)) on _[Picard 2-groupoids of superalgebras](super+algebra#Picard2Groupoid)_. What we add to this here is that we make explit the incarnation of these constructions as the [[∞-stack|higher stack]] on [[supermanifolds]] $2\mathbf{sLine}$ of super line 2-bundles. This is a supergeometric refinement of the [[moduli infinity-stack|moduli 2-stack]] $\mathbf{B}^2\mathbb{C}^\times$ for bare complex line 2-bundles, $\mathbb{C}^\times$-[[principal 2-bundles]].

###### Definition

Let $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq $ [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]] be the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd|smooth super-∞-groupoids]]. With [[CartSp]]${}_{th}$ the [[site]] given by the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[supermanifolds]] on those of the form $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ for $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$ this is the corresponding [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]]

$$
  SmoothSuper\infty Grod \simeq Sh_\infty(CartSp_{th})
$$

This is cohesive over [[Super∞Grpd]] $ \simeq Sh_\infty(SuperPoints)$

$$
  \Gamma \colon SmoothSuper\infty Grpd  \to Super \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

Let $\mathbb{K} \in \mathbf{H}$ be the canocal [[affine line|affine]] [[line object]], whose underlying sheaf of sets assigns 

$$
  \mathbb{K} \colon \mathbb{R}^{p|q} \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathbb{C})\otimes (\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{C}^q)_{even}
 \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[[superalgebra]]_ we have that $\Gamma(\mathbb{K})$-algebras in [[Super∞Grpd]] are, externally, superalgebras over the [[complex numbers]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Defintion

Write

$$
  2\mathbf{sVect} \in SmoothSuper \infty Grpd
$$

for the object which over $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ is the [[2-groupoid]] whose 

* objects are semisimple $\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})$-algebras;

* [[1-morphisms]] are invertible [[bimodules]];

* [[2-morphisms]] are invertible bimodule homomorphisms.

This is naturally a [[braided monoidal 2-category]] object. Write

$$
 2 \mathbf{sLine} \in SmoothSuper \infty Grpd
$$

for the maximal [[braided 3-group]] inside this on the invertible objects.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The object $2\mathbf{sLine} \in SmoothSuper\infty Grpd$ is equivalent to that which to $\mathbb{R}^{p|q}$ assigns the 2-gorupoid with

* objects are the algebra $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathbb{C})\otimes (\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{C}^q)_{even}$ and that algebra tensored with $Cl_1(\mathbb{C})$;

* morphisms are $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathb{C})\otimes (\wedge^\bullet \mathbb{C}^q)_{even}$ regarded as a bimodule over itself and that bimodule tensored with $Cl_1(\mathbb{C})$;

* 2-morphisms form the group $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathbb{C}^\times)$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First, the $\mathbb{K}$-algebras in the topos of supergeometry are externally the ordinary [[superalgebras]], by the discussion at _[superalgebra -- As algebras in the topos over superpoints](super+algebra#AlgebraOverSuperpoints)_. 

With this the statement is a straightforward generalization of the discussion at  _[superalgebra -- Picard 2-groupoid](super+algebra#Picard2Groupoid)_ from superalgebras over $\mathbb{C}$ to those over $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathbb{C})$.

While the invertible ordinary $\mathbb{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R})$-algebras are equivalent to that algebra itself (hence there is only one, up to equivalence); the invertible superalgebras are equivalent either to the ground field or to the complex [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl_1(\mathbb{C})$ (hence there are two, up to equivalence, the two elements in the [[Brauer group]] $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \pi_0(2\mathbf{sLine})$ ). Similarly for the invertible bimodules. Finally the inverticle intertwiners are pointwise $\mathbb{C}^\times$.

###### Remark

Therefore we have a canonical morphism

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{C}^\times \simeq 2\mathbf{Line} \to 2\mathbf{sLine}
$$

in [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]] (a [[n-monomorphism|2-monomorphism]]) from the [[moduli ∞-stack|moduli 2-stack]] of $\mathbb{C}^\times$-[[principal 2-bundles]]/[[bundle gerbes]], which picks the "ordinary" super 2-line bundle (as opposed to its "superpartner"), ignores the odd auto-[[gauge transformations]] of that and keeps all the [[higher gauge transformations]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In [[bosonic string theory]] over a [[spacetime]] $X$ the [[background gauge field]] called the [[B-field]] is a line 2-bundle [[circle n-bundle with connection|with connection]] given by a morphism 

$$
  X \to 2\mathbf{Line} \simeq \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{C}^\times
  \,.
$$

However in [[type II superstring theory]] the [[B-field]] is actually a super line 2-bundle, hence given by a morphism

$$
  X \to 2\mathbf{sLine} 
$$

in [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]]. This observation (formulated in less stacky language) is due to the analysis of [[orientifold]] background fields in ([Precis](#Precis)).

###### Remark

Comparison with the notation and terminology of 
([Freed-Hopkins-Teleman 07](#FreedHopkinsTeleman)):

the "$\mathcal{B}\mathbb{T}^{\pm}$" on the top of p. 14 there is 
$\Omega (2\mathbf{sLine})$ here; a graded line bundle over some $X$ there is a map of stacks $X \to \Omega (2\mathbf{sLine})$ here.

For $X$ 1-truncated, hence a groupoid, a graded central extension in the sense there is a map $X \to 2\mathbf{sLine}$ which factors as 
$X \to \mathbf{B}\Omega (2\mathbf{sLine}) \to 2\mathbf{sLine}$.
