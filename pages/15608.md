## Idea

In [[stable homotopy theory]] the [[rational homotopy theory|rational]] [[Bousfield localization of spectra]], hence $\mathbb{Q}$-localization $L_{S\mathbb{Q}}$, is accompanied dually by "$\mathbb{Q}$-acyclification" $G_{S\mathbb{Q}}$, forming a natural [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  G_{S \mathbb{Q}} X \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow L_{S\mathbb{Q}} X
$$

(by [this proposition](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#LocalizationCofiber)).

This $G_{S\mathbb{Q}}$ is the operation of _universal torsion approximation_.
In the special case of [[chain complexes]] it corresponds to the [[derived functor]] that forms [[torsion subgroups]] (see the discussion at _[fracture theorem -- Arithmetic fracturing of chain complexes](fracture+theorem#CompletionAndTorsionOnDerivedCategories)_).

Similarly, if one already looks at [[p-local spectra]] then torsion approximation is the homotopy fiber of $S\mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}]$-localization.


## Properties

Under suitable conditions, torsion approximation forms an [[adjoint modality]] with [[adic completion]]. See at _[Fracturing for chain complexes](fracture+theorem#CompletionAndTorsionOnDerivedCategories)_ for more on this.
