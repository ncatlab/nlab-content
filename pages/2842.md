## Definition

A [[continuous map]] $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ is a **Hurewicz cofibration** if it satisfies the **[[homotopy extension property]]**. 

This means that 

* for any [[topological space]] $Y$, 

* all continuous maps $f:A\to Y$, $\tilde{f}:X\to Y$ such that $\tilde{f}\circ i=f$ 

* and a [[homotopy]] $F:A\times I\to Y$ such that $F(-,0)=f$ 

there is a homotopy $\tilde{F}:X\times I\to Y$ such that 
  
* $\tilde{F}\circ(i\times id_I)=F$ 

* and $\tilde{F}(-,0)=\tilde{f}$. 

$$
  \array{
     A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde f}} 
     \\
     X  
  }
$$

We say that a Hurewicz cofibration $i:A\to X$ is a **closed cofibration** if $i(A)$ is closed in $X$.

If $A\subset X$ is closed and the inclusion is a cofibration, then the pair $(X,A)$ is an [[NDR-pair]].

There is also a version for [[pointed space]]s.

## Properties

### Closedness


Every Hurewicz cofibration $i$ is an injective map and if the image $i(A)$ is closed then it is a homeomorphism onto its image. In the category of [[weakly Hausdorff space|weakly Hausdorff]] [[compactly generated spaces]], $i(A)$ is always closed (the same in the category of all [[Hausdorff spaces]]), but in the category of all topological spaces there are pathological counterexamples. 
The simplest example (see the classical monograph Dieck, Kamps, Puppe, _Homotopietheorie_, LNM 157) is the following: let $A =\{a\}$ and $X=\{a,b\}$ be the one and two element sets, both with antidiscrete topology (only $X$ and $\emptyset$ are open in $X$), and $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion $a\mapsto a$. Then $i$ is a non-closed cofibration (useful exercise!). 



### Model structure

The collections

* [[Hurewicz fibration]]s, 

* closed Hurewicz cofibrations 

* and [[homotopy equivalences]] 

make one of the standard Quillen [[model category]] structures on the category [[Top]] of all topological spaces; see [[Strøm's model category]]. 

### Interaction with pullbacks

###### Theorem

Let

$$
  \array{
     X_0 &\hookrightarrow & X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_0}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\ 
     B_0 &\hookrightarrow& B
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow
     \\
     E_0 &\hookrightarrow& E
  }
$$

be a [[commuting diagram]] of [[topological space]]s such that

* the horizontal morphisms are closed cofibrations;

* the morphisms $p_0$ and $p$ are [[Hurewicz fibration]]s.

Then the induced morphism on [[pullback]]s is also a closed cofibration

$$
  X_0 \times_{B_0} E_0 \hookrightarrow X \times_B E
  \,.
$$

This is stated and proven in ([Kieboom](#Kieboom)).

The [[product]] of two closed cofibrations is a closed cofibration.
