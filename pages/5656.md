## Idea

One says _ordinary cohomology_ for the [[cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $K(\mathbb{A})$ for some [[abelian group]] $A$. 

This is to distinguish from more general notions of [[cohomology]], such as [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] and [[nonabelian cohomology]].

## Properties

Ordinary cohomology is modeled by [[singular cohomology]].

## Related concepts

* The refinement to [[differential cohomology]] is [[ordinary differential cohomology]].

* [[ordinary homology]]
