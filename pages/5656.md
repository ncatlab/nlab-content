## Idea

One says _ordinary cohomology_ for the [[cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $K(\mathbb{A})$ for some [[abelian group]] $A$. 

This is to distinguish from more general notions of [[cohomology]], such as [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] and [[nonabelian cohomology]].

## Properties

### Presentation by singular cohomology

Ordinary cohomology is modeled by [[singular cohomology]].

### General

* [[universal coefficient theorem]]

* [[Künneth theorem]]

* [[Hopf degree theorem]]

* [[Hurewicz theorem]], [[Boardman homomorphism]]

* [[Eilenberg-Zilber theorem]]
