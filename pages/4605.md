Given any [[set]] $X$, there is a unique __empty [[family]]__ of elements of $X$.  Formally, this is given by the [[empty function]] to $X$, the unique [[function]] from to $X$ from the [[empty set]].  As the empty set is [[finite set|finite]] and (a fortiori) [[countable set|countable]], this empty family counts as a [[list]] and a [[sequence]]; in such a guise it is known as the __empty list__ or the __empty sequence__.

When treating it as an element of the [[free monoid]] on $X$, the empty list may be written $()$, $*$, or $\epsilon$, perhaps with a subscript $X$ if desired.

Similarly, we have the notions of the empty family of elements of a [[preset]] or other notion of [[type]], the empty family of [[objects]] and the empty family of [[morphisms]] of a given [[category]], and more generally the empty family of whatever you want.
