## Idea

$Spectrum$ is the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[spectrum|spectra]].  It is also denoted $Sp$, or sometimes $Spec$ although that [[affine scheme|can be confusing]].

It is the free stable [[locally presentable (infinity,1)-category]] on one [[compact object|compact]] generator, namely the [[sphere spectrum]].

$Sp$ is the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[quasicoherent infinity-stacks]] on [[Spec(S)]].
