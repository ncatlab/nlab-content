## Idea

In [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) a [[singularity]] (such as that of a [[black hole]]) that is not behind an [[event horizon]] is called a _naked singularity_.

Naked singulrities appear for "extremal" black holes, with maximum [[charge]]/[[angular momentum]] at the given [[mass]] (see at [[charged and rotating black holes -- table]]).


Accoringly, in [[supergravity]] naked singularities appear for [[BPS state]] [[black branes]].
