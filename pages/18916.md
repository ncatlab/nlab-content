
In [[number theory]], _[[Ken Ribet]]'s theorem_ is a statement about [[Galois representations]] associated with [[modular forms]]. 

[[Jean-Pierre Serre]] ad [[Ken Ribet]] observed that assuming the [[Taniyama-Shimura modularity conjecture]] (as yet unproven at that time) it implies [[Fermat's last theorem]]. The [[modularity theorem]] was then proven by [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Richard Taylor]], thus often known now as _[[Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem]]_.
