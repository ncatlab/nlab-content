## Idea

The [[axioms]] of traditional [[algebraic quantum field theory]] or [[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]], where one assigns a plain [[algebra]] (e.g. a [[C*-algebra]] or [[formal power series algebra]]) of [[observables]] to a [[spacetime]] region, fail when one considers [[gauge theory]] on [[spacetimes]] more general than [[Minkowski spacetime]] ([[AQFT on curved spacetimes]]): 

The nature of [[gauge fields]] implies that to re-construct their global configuration (including non-trivial topology as in [[instanton sectors]]) one needs to locally remember the [[groupoid]] of [[gauge transformations]] (see [Eggertsson 14](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/bachelor+thesis+Eggertsson), [Schenkel 14](#Schenkel14), [Schreiber 14](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Higher+field+bundles+for+gauge+fields) for exposition), and hence, after [[quantization]], some [[higher algebra]] of observables. 

The program of _homotopical algebraic quantum field theory_ ([Benini-Schenkel 16](#BeniniSchenkel16), see [Schenkel 17](#Schenkel17) for survey) is to lift the axioms of [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]] to certain [[local nets]] of [[homotopical algebra|homotopical algebras]] such as to properly capture [[gauge theory]] with topologically non-trivial [[gauge field]] configurations.

The axioms as considered in [Schenkel 17](#Schenkel17) have some  similarity with that of [[factorization homology]], but also do take into account the [[causality]] condition for [[quantum fields]] on [[Lorentzian manifolds]].
