## Idea

In analogy to how a [[smooth manifold]] is a [[manifold]] modeled on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ in [[CartSp]], a _Fréchet manifold_ is a [[manifold]] modeled on a [[Fréchet space]].

## Definition
It is possible to define, analog to the finite dimensional case, the notion of smooth functions of [[Fréchet spaces]], see there. Therefore, the usual definition of a manifold carries over word by word:

###### Definition
A **Fréchet manifold** is a Hausdorff topological space with an atlas of coordinate charts taking their value in Fréchet spaces, such that the coordinate transition functions are all smooth functions between Fréchet spaces.

It is possible to generalize some concepts of differential geometry from the finite case to the Fréchet case, one has to be careful, however:

1. The dual of a Fréchet space that is not a [[Banach space]] is never a Fréchet space, therefore one cannot e.g. define both the tangent and the cotangent bundle as Fréchet manifolds. More serious is however

2. The existence and uniqueness theorems for ordinary differential equations fail in infinite dimensions, so that theorems depending on that from finite dimensional differential geometry cannot be transscribed to the infinite situation in general. It is possible to do this on a case by case basis however.

## Examples

Standard examples of Fréchet manifolds are smooth mapping spaces such as the

* [[smooth loop space]].
