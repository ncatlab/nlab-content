## Definition

###### Definition

A [[functor]] $F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ between [[additive category|additive categories]] is itself called __additive__ if it preserves finite [[biproducts]].

That is, 

1. $F$ maps a [[zero object]] to a zero object, $F(0) \simeq 0 \in \mathcal{B}$; 

1. given any two [[objects]] $x, y \in \mathcal{A}$, there is an [[isomorphism]] $F(x \oplus y) \cong F(x) \oplus F(y)$, and this respects the inclusion and projection maps of the [[direct sum]]:

$$
\array { x &          &            &          & y \\
           & {}_{\mathllap{i_X}}\searrow &            & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{i_y}} \\
           &          & x \oplus y \\
           & {}^{\mathllap{p_x}}\swarrow &            & \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_y}} \\
         x &          &            &          & y }
\quad\quad\stackrel{F}{\mapsto}\quad\quad
\array { F(x) &          &                                      &          & F(y) \\
              & {}_{\mathllap{i_{F(x)}}}\searrow &   & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{i_{F(y)}}} \\
              &          & F(x \oplus y) \cong F(x) \oplus F(y) \\
              & {}^{\mathllap{p_{F(X)}}}\swarrow &                                      & \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_{F(y)}}} \\
         F(x) &          &                                      &          & F(y) }
$$

###### Remark

In practice, functors between additive categories are generally assumed to be additive.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The [[hom-functor]] $Hom(-,-) \colon \mathcal{A}^{op}\times \mathcal{A} \to Ab$ is additive (and in both arguments separately).

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]] and $N \in \mathcal{A}$, the  functor that forms [[tensor product of modules]] $(-)\otimes N \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$.

=--

In fact thes examples are generic, see prop. \ref{RightExactAdditiveIsTensor} below.

## Properties

### Relation to $Ab$-enriched functors

An [[additive category]] canonically carries the structure of an [[Ab-enriched category]] where the $Ab$-enrichment structure is induced from the biproducts as described at _[[biproduct]]_. 

+-- {: .num_prop #AdditiveIsAbEnriched}
###### Proposition

With respect to the canonical [[Ab-enriched category]]-structre on additive categories $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{B}$, additive functors $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ are equivalently [[Ab]]-[[enriched functors]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

An $Ab$-enriched functor preserves all finite biproducts that exist, since finite biproducts in [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enriched categories]] are [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy colimits]].

### Characterization of right exact additive functors
 {#CharacterizationByExactness}

Let $R, R'$ be [[rings]].

The following is the _[[Eilenberg-Watts theorem]]_. See there for more.

+-- {: .num_prop #RightExactAdditiveIsTensor}
###### Proposition

If an additive functor $F : R$[[Mod]] $\to R'$[[Mod]] is a [[right exact functor]], then there exists an $R'$-$R$-[[bimodule]] $B$ and a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  F \simeq B \otimes_R (-)
$$

with the functor that forms the [[tensor product]] with $B$.

This is ([Watts, theorem 1](#Watts)),

* [[additive monad]]

* [[enriched functor]]

* In the context of [[derived functors in homological algebra]] one considers functors that are additive and in addition left/right [[exact functors]], as discussed above in _[Characterization by exactness](#CharacterizationByExactness)_.
