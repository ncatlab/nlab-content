## Idea ##

In certain [[foundations of mathematics]], the "[[functions]]" between [[sets]] or [[types]] or [[presets]] do not preserve the [[equality]] in the set/type/preset. Many times, the functions that do not preserve equality are called "prefunctions", and a function is defined to be a prefunction that satisfies [[function extensionality]]. 

## Definition 

### In set theory

Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are sets, a prefunction from $X$ to $Y$ is a mapping that does not preserve equality: it is not true that $a = b$ always implies $f(a) = f(b)$. A function is defined as a prefunction that preserves equality; such a prefunction is said to be __extensional__.

For example, consider the identity prefunction on the set of pairs of positive numbers, $Z^+ \times Z^+$ and the set of positive fractions $Q^+$. From $Z^+ \times Z^+$ to $Q^+$, this is a function, since $a/b = c/d$ if $(a,b) = (c,d)$. But from $Q^+$ to $Z^+ \times Z^+$, it is not a function, since (for example) $2/4 = 3/6$ but $(2,4) \neq (3,6)$. A related example is the operation of taking the numerator of a (positive) fraction; from $Q^+$ to $Z^+$, we may view this as a prefunction but not as a function, although it is a function on $Z^+ \times Z^+$.

Given sets $X$ and $Y$, the [[function set]] from $X$ to $Y$ is a [[subset]] of this set of prefunctions between $X$ and $Y$. Composition of prefunctions is also possible, but likewise does not preserve equality. 

### In type theory

In many foundations based on type theory, such as [[Martin-Löf type theory]], all types come equipped with an [[identity type]] which behaves similarly as equality does in sets, and therefore are not [[presets]], which do not have any equality at all. However, functions between types usually do not satisfy function extensionality, and in the set-theoretic sense are properly prefunctions. 

## Categorical semantics

The difference between functions and prefunctions in sets is modeled in [[category theory]] as the difference between an [[evaluational category]], a [[concrete category]] where [[morphisms]] behave as functions do in [[Set]], and an [[extensional category]], which is an evaluational category where all functions preserve the equality in sets, relating equality of elements to equality of functions. 

The same difference in type theory, such as intensional Martin-Löf type theory and homotopy type theory, is represented as concrete $(\infty,1)$-categorical versions of evaluational and extensional categories. These are usually internally represented by Tarski-style [[universes]]: where the universes with the axiom of [[function extensionality]] are extensional [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-categories]], and the ones without the axiom are merely evaluational [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-categories]] in the type theory.
