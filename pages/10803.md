## Idea

The term _$p$-adic cohomology_ would broadly refer to [[cohomology]] over [[spaces]] in [[p-adic geometry]].

More specifically it is used for [[crystalline cohomology]] in positive [[characteristic]],
based on the [[comparison theorem (crystalline cohomology)|comparison theorem]] in [[crystalline cohomology]] in positive charascteristic, which says that equivalent to [[de Rham cohomology]] in [[p-adic geometry]].

Notice that by "$p$-adic cohomology" one could also mean [[cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in [[p-adic numbers]]. An example of this is [[ℓ-adic cohomology]] which has [[p-adic number|ℓ-adic]] [[coefficients]], genuinely so over the [[pro-étale site]]). But not in all cases does this give the expected answers.
