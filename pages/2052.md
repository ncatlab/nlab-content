The __combinatorial group theory__ is an approach to the theory of discrete groups based on presentations of groups, that is describing the groups by generators and relations. Despite an apparent first-look simplicity of presentations most basic problems of combinatorial group theory are difficult and unsolvable in general; for example S.P. Novikov and collaborators proved the existence of a group for which the __word problem__, that is the question of equality of words, is algorithmically undecidable; in other words there is a presentation of this group such that no algorithm can take as an output arbitrary two words in the generators and decide in finite time if they represent the same element of the group. 

While sometimes the presentation method is used in the theory of finite groups, most often not very deep facts are used; instead finite group theory is rather dominated with interaction with [[representation theory]], [[ring]] theory, cohomology of groups and so on. Typical groups for which combinatorial method gives deep results are infinite discrete groups which are close in some sense to free groups, e.g. groups with a presentation having only one relation. Such groups often appear as fundamental groups of topological spaces. 

Nowdays combinatorial group theory uses fruitfully connections to [[topology]] and graph theory: say the fact that some group can be realized say as a [[fundamental group]] of a space, or that a group acts on a topological space are widely explored, to invite topological methods. In fact there is a hybrid field, the _geometric group theory_ ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_group_theory)).
