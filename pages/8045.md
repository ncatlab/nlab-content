
__Material set theory__ (also called _membership-based set
theory_) is a style of [[set theory]] that contrasts with [[structural set theory]].  In a material set theory, the elements of a set exist independently of that set.

Frequently in material set theory one takes everything to be a [[pure set]], including the elements of sets themselves.   Therefore, any two sets may be meaningfully compared to ask if they are [[equal]] or if one is a member of the other.  As a slight variation (still material set theory), one may also accept ur-elements (or atoms) as elements.  The main distinguishing feature of a material set theory is a global membership predicate, whereby it is meaningful to ask, given any object and a set, whether the object is an element of the set.
