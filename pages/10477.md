## Definition

A **Reedy category with fibrant constants** is a [[Reedy category]] $R$ such that for every [[model category]] $M$ an every fibrant object $X \in M$ the constant $R$-diagram at $X$ is Reedy fibrant.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For a Reedy category $R$ the following are equivalent.

1. $R$ has fibrant constants.
1. For any model category $M$ the colimit functor $\colim_R \colon M^R \to M$ is a [[Quillen adjunction|left Quillen functor]].
1. All matching categories of $R$ are connected or empty.

This theorem is proven in [Hirschhorn,Proposition 15.10.2 and Theorem 15.10.8](#Hirshhorn).

###### Proposition

1. The product of two Reedy categories with fibrant constants is a Reedy category with fibrant constants.
1. If $R$ is an [[elegant Reedy category]] and $X$ is a presheaf on $R$, then the [[category of elements]] of $X$ is a Reedy category with fibrant constants.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

1. This follows by combining point 3. of the theorem above with the fact that the matching categories satisfy the "Leibniz rule", see [Riehl, Verity, Observation 4.2](#RiehlVerity).
1. This is proven in [Hirschhorn, Proposition 15.10.4](#Hirschhorn) in the case of $R = \Delta$, but the argument given there applies to any elegant Reedy category.

## Examples

* The [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ is a Reedy category with fibrant constants.

* More generally, Joyal's [[Theta category|disk categories]] $\Theta_n$ are Reedy categories with fibrant constants.

* Every [[direct category]] is a Reedy category with fibrant constants.
