## Definition

A [[category]] is sometimes called __pointed__ if it has a [[zero object]] (e.g. [Quillen 67, II.2 def. 4](#Quillen67)), i.e. if it has an [[initial object]] and a [[terminal object]] and they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. 

(If the morphism from the [[initial object]] to the [[terminal object]] is not necessarily an [[isomorphism]] but just a [[monomorphism]] then one speaks also of a [[quasi-pointed category]].)

Every category of [[pointed objects]] is a pointed category in this sense, and this is probably the motivation for the terminology. 

Beware that the concept of _[[pointed objects]] in [[Cat]]_, which may also be called "pointed categories" is more general and more restricted: these are categories with any one [[object]] singled out, with [[functors]] between them preserving these objects.

Beware also that the concept of _[[well-pointed topos]]_ is unrelated.

## Properties

### Canonical enrichment in pointed sets

Every [[locally small category|locally small]] pointed category is naturally  [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category of [[pointed sets]] using the [[smash product]] as [[tensor product]], (but the converse may fail).
