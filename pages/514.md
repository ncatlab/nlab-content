## Definition

A category is (sometimes) called __pointed__ if it has a [[zero object]]. Every such category (at least if [[locally small category|locally small]]) may be interpreted as [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category of [[pointed set]]s using the [[smash product]] as tensor, (but not necessarily the other way around).


## Remarks

* The terminology certainly comes from the fact that every category of [[pointed object]]s has a [[zero object]]: the point.

* In the homotopical context of a [[category of fibrant objects|pointed category of fibrant objects]] many of the familiar constructions from homotopy theory in [[Top]] have analogs.

* Notice that this notion of pointed is _not_ related to usage such as in [[well-pointed topos]].  Nor is it to be confused with a [[pointed object]] in [[Cat]], which is just a category equipped with a chosen object (which need not be initial or terminal).

* A slight weakening of the concept of a pointed category is that of a [[quasi-pointed category]].
