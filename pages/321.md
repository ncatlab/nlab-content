## Definition 

### Spans

In any [[category]] $C$, a __span__, or __roof__, or __correspondence__, from an [[object]] $x$ to an object $y$ is a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     && s
      \\
      & {}^{f}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{g}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     y
  }
$$

where $s$ is some other object of the category.  (The word "correspondence" is also sometimes used for a [[profunctor]].)

This [[diagram]] is called a 'span' because it looks like a little bridge; 'roof' is similar.  The term 'correspondence' is prevalent in geometry and related areas; it comes about because a correspondence is a generalisation of a binary [[relation]].  

Note that a span with $f = 1$ is just a morphism from $x$ to $y$, while a span with $g = 1$ is a morphism from $y$ to $x$.  So, a span can be thought of as a generalization of a morphism in which there is no longer any asymmetry between source and target.

A span in the [[opposite category]] $C^op$ is called a [[co-span]] in $C$.  

A span that has a [[cocone]] is called a [[coquadrable span]].

### Categories of spans

If the category $C$ has [[pullback|pullbacks]], we can compose spans.  Namely, given a span from $x$ to $y$ and a span from $y$ to $z$:
$$
  \array{
     && s &&&& t
      \\
      & {}^{f}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{g}
       &
       & {}^{h}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{i}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     y
     &&&&
     z
  }
$$

we can take a pullback in the middle:

$$
  \array{
     &&&& s \times_y t 
     \\& 
    &&
      {}^{p_s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{p_t}
    \\
     && s &&&& t
      \\
      & {}^{f}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{g}
       &
       & {}^{h}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{i}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     y
     &&&&
     z
  }
$$

and obtain a span from $x$ to $z$:

$$
  \array{
     && s \times_y t
      \\
      & {}^{f p_s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{i p_t}
     \\
     x
     &&&&
     z
  }
$$

This way of composing spans lets us define a [[2-category]] $Span(C)$ with:

* objects of $C$ as objects
* spans as morphisms
* maps between spans as 2-morphisms

This is a weak 2-category: it has a nontrivial [[associator]]: composition of spans is not strictly associative, because pullbacks are defined only up to canonical isomorphism.  A [[Lack's coherence theorem|naturally defined]] [[strict 2-category]] which is equivalent to $Span(C)$ is the strict 2-category of [[linear polynomial functors]] between [[slice categories]] of $C$.

(Note that we must choose a specific pullback when defining the composite of a pair of morphisms in $Span(C)$, if we want to obtain a [[bicategory]] as traditionally defined; this requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Otherwise we obtain a bicategory with 'composites of morphisms defined only up to canonical iso-2-morphism'; such a structure can be modeled by an [[anabicategory]] or an [[opetopic bicategory]].)


## Properties

### The 1-category of spans

Let $C$ be a category with [[pullback]]s and let $Span_1(C) := (Span(C))_{\sim 1}$ be the 1-category of objects of $C$ and isomorphism class of spans between them as morphisms.

Then

* $Span_1(C)$ is a [[dagger category]].

Next assume that $C$ is a [[cartesian monoidal category]]. Then clearly $Span_1(C)$ naturally becomes a [[monoidal category]] itself, but more: then

* $Span_1(C)$ is a [[dagger compact category]].

### Universal property of the 2-category of spans




## Examples

* Spans in [[FinSet]] behave like the [[categorification]] of  [[matrices]] with entries in the [[natural number]]s: for $X_1 \leftarrow N \to X_2$ a span of finite sets, the [[cardinality]] of the [[fiber]] $X_{x_1, x_2}$ over any two elements $x_1 \in X_2$ and $x_2 \in X_2$ plays the role of the corresponding matrix entry. Under this identification composition of spaces indeed corresponds to matrix multiplication.

* A [[cobordism]] $\Sigma$ from $\Sigma_{in}$ to $\Sigma_{out}$ is an example of a cospan $\Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$ in the category of [[smooth manifold]]s. However, composition of cobordisms is not quite the pushpout-compisition of these cospans: to make the composition be a [[smooth manifold]] again some extra technical aspects must be added ("collars").
