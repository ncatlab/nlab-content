## Idea

[[motive|Motivic]] structures enters [[quantum physics]] in two dual guises, related to on the one hand [[algebraic deformation quantization]] and on the other hand to [[geometric quantization]]

### Via perturbative algebraic deformation quantization

In the first case one observes that [[formal deformation quantization]] of $n$-dimensional [[prequantum field theory]] amounts to choosing an inverse [[equivalence]] to the [[formality]] map from [[En-algebras]] to [[Pn-algebras]], this is explained at _[Motivic Galois group action on the space of quantizations](deformation+quantization#MotivicGaloisGroup)_. 

The [[automorphism infinity-group]] of either side therefore naturally [[infinity-action|acts]] on the space of formal deformation quantization choices obtained this way and one shows (conjectured by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] ([Kontsevich 99](#Kontsevich99)), recently proven by Dolgushev) that the connected component group of this is the 
[[Grothendieck-Teichmüller group]], a [[quotient]] of the [[motivic Galois group]]. 
Related to this in some way is [[Alain Connes]]' "[[cosmic Galois group]]" [[action|acting]] on the space of [[renormalization|renormalizations]] of [[perturbative quantum field theory]]. 

According to Kontsevich, this explains the role of motivc [[periods]] in [[correlation functions]] and hence in [[scattering amplitudes]] (see also at _[[amplituhedron]]_) in [[perturbative field theory]], see the motive-related references at _[[Feynman diagram]]_, at _[[motivic multiple zeta values]] _[[motivic L-function]]_.


### Via non-perturbative geometric quantization

On the other hand, in full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[geometric quantization]] in its modern cohomological form as [geometric quantization by push-forward](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+quantization+by+push-forward) one finds a "[[cohesion|cohesive]]" form of actual [[motivic cohomology]]exhibited by "[[cohesive]] [[pure motives]]". In effect, a [[local action functional]] on a [[moduli space]] of [[field (physics)|field]] [[trajectories]] is exhibited by a [[correspondence]]
with the [[local action functional]] itself exhibited by a [[twisted bivariant cohomology|twisted bivariant cocycle]] on the correspondence space, and the [[motivic quantization|motivic path integral quantization]] of this corresponds to the induced pull-push index transform. See the [references below](#ReferencesNonPerturbativeGeometric).

### On motivic structures in non-perturbative local quantum field theory
 {#ReferencesNonPerturbativeGeometric}

The formulation of [[quantization]] of [[local prequantum field theory]] as a passage to [[cohesive]] generalized [[pure motives]], hence "[[motivic quantization]]" is formulated as such in the last section of

* [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]_ ([arXiv:1310.7930](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7930))

based on 

* [[Joost Nuiten]], _[[schreiber:master thesis Nuiten|Cohomological quantization of local prequantum boundary field theory]]_


The following is a list of "precursors" of aspects of the idea [[motivic quantization]] as laid out there

$\,$

The formulation of [[geometric quantization]] as an [[index]] map in [[K-theory]] is attributed to [[Raoul Bott]].

The proposal that the natural [[domain]] for geometric quantization are [[Lagrangian correspondences]] is due to 

* [[Lars Hörmander]], _Fourier Integral Operators I._, Acta Math. __127__ (1971)
 {#Hoermander71}

* [[Alan Weinstein]], _Symplectic manifolds and their lagrangian submanifolds_, Advances in Math. __6__ (1971) {#Weinstein71}

In [[semiclassical quantization]] the precursor to this are works of [[Maslov]] in 1960s (which are quite related to Hoermander's and Sato's work).

With the recognition of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] in the 1980s, [[index theory]] (hence [[push-forward in generalized cohomology]] to the point) was understood to be about [[partition functions]] of systems of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] in 

* [[Luis Alvarez-Gaumé]], _Supersymmetry and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem_, Comm. Math. Phys. __90__:2 (1983) 161-173, [euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103940278) {#AlvarezGaume83}

* [[Ezra Getzler]], _Pseudodifferential operators on supermanifolds and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem_, Comm. Math. Phys. 92 (1983), 163-178. ([pdf](http://math.northwestern.edu/~getzler/Papers/1103940796.pdf))
 {#Getzler83}

*  [[Ezra Getzler]], _A short proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem_, Topology 25 (1986), 111-117 ([pdf](http://math.northwestern.edu/~getzler/Papers/local.pdf))

In higher analogy to this but much more subtly, the [[partition function]] of the [[heterotic string]], hence the [[Witten genus]], was understood to be the [[push-forward in generalized cohomology|push-forward]] to the point in [[tmf]]:

* [[Matthew Ando]], [[Mike Hopkins]], [[Charles Rezk]], _Multiplicative orientations of KO-theory and the spectrum of topological modular forms_, 2010 ([pdf](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~mando/papers/koandtmf.pdf))
  {#AndoHopkinsRezk}

The general perspective of the [[path integral as a pull-push transform]] was originally laid out, somewhat implicitly, in

* [[Daniel Freed]], _Quantum groups from path integrals_, [arXiv:q-alg/9501025](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/q-alg/9501025); _Higher algebraic structures and quantization_, [arXiv:hep-th/9212115](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9212115)

and then fully explicitly in

* [[Daniel Freed]], _Twisted K-theory and the Verlinde ring_, Andrejewski lecture ([pdf slides](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/Andrejewski%20Lectures.html))

Discussion along these lines of a pull-push quantization over [[KU]] of a 2-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]]-like [[gauge theory]] is in 

* [[Daniel Freed]], [[Michael Hopkins]], [[Constantin Teleman]], _Consistent orientation of moduli spaces_, [arXiv:0711.1909](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1909) {#FreedHopkinsTeleman07}

More in detail a functorial quantization of suitable correspondences of smooth manifolds to [[KK-theory]] by pull-push has been given in ([Connes-Skandalis 84](#ConnesSkandalis84)) and the generalization of that to [[equivariant K-theory]] (hence to [[groupoid K-theory]] of [[action groupoids]]) is in

* [[Heath Emerson]], [[Ralf Meyer]], _Bivariant K-theory via correspondences_, Adv. Math. 225 (2010), 2883-2919 ([arXiv:0812.4949](http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4949))
 {#EmersonMeyer08}



The point of view that the [[path integral as a pull-push transform|pull-push quantization]] of [[Gromov-Witten theory]] should be thought of as a theory of [[Chow motives]] of [[Deligne-Mumford stacks]] is expressed in 

* [[Kai Behrend]], [[Yuri Manin]], _Stacks of Stable Maps and Gromov-Witten Invariants_ ([arXiv:alg-geom/9506023](http://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9506023))

 {#Toen00}


The proposal that the natural [[codomain]] for geometric quantization is [[KK-theory]] is due to 

* [[Klaas Landsman]], _Functorial quantization and the Guillemin-Sternberg conjecture_ Proc. Bialowieza 2002 ([arXiv:math-ph/0307059](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0307059))

The point of view that pull-push along [[correspondences]] equipped with [[operator K-theory]] [[cycles]] in [[KK-theory]] is a [[K-theory]]-analog of [[motives]] was amplified in 

* [[Alain Connes]], [[Georges Skandalis]], _The longitudinal index theorem for foliations_. Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 20,
no. 6, 1139–1183 (1984) ([pdf](http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/longitudinal.pdf))

 {#ConnesConsaniMarcolli05}

The proof that the [[universal property]] that characterizes [[noncommutative motives]] is the analog in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] of the [[universal property]] that characterizes [[KK-theory]] in [[noncommutative topology]] is due to

* [[Gonçalo Tabuada]], _K-theory via universal invariants_, Duke Math. J. 145 (2008), no.1, 121–206.

 {#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10}

The description of [[string topology]] operations as an [[HQFT]] defined by pull-push transforms in [[ordinary homology]]/[[ordinary cohomology]] was originally realized in 

* [[Ralph Cohen]], [[Veronique Godin]],  _[[A Polarized View of String Topology]]_ ([arXiv:math/0303003](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0303003))

* Hirotaka Tamanoi, _Loop coproducts in string topology and triviality of higher genus TQFT operations_ (2007) ([arXiv:0706.1276](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1276))
 {#Tamanoi07}

A detailed discussion and generalization to [[open strings]] and an open-closed [[HQFT]] in the presence of a single space-filling [[brane]] is in

* [[Veronique Godin]], _Higher string topology operations_ (2007)([arXiv:0711.4859](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4859))

and for arbitrary [[branes]] in 

* [[Alexander Kupers]], _String topology operations_ MS thesis (2011) ([pdf](http://math.stanford.edu/~kupers/thesis7thjune2011.pdf))

That [[D-brane charge]] and [[T-duality]] is naturally understood in terms of pull-push/[[indices]] along [[correspondences]] in [[noncommutative topology]]/[[KK-theory]] was amplified in 

* [[Jacek Brodzki]], [[Varghese Mathai]], [[Jonathan Rosenberg]], [[Richard Szabo]],  _Noncommutative correspondences, duality and D-branes in bivariant K-theory_, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys.13:497-552,2009 ([arXiv:0708.2648](http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2648))
 {#BMRS2}

 {#Mahanta13}

where it is shown that there is a universal functor $KK \longrightarrow NCC_{dg}$ from [[KK-theory]] to the category of [[noncommutative motives]], which is the category of [[dg-categories]] and dg-[[profunctors]] up to homotopy between them. This is given by sending a [[C*-algebra]] to the [[dg-category]] of [[perfect complexes]] of (the unitalization of) its underlying [[associative algebra]].


Linearization of correspondences of [[discrete groupoid|geometrically discrete groupoids]] was considered in 

* [[John Baez]], [[Jim Dolan]], _Groupoidification_, November 2009 ([web](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/groupoidification/))
