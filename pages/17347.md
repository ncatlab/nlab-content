**Abstract.** _The [[category]] of those [[generalized cohomology theories]] that are equipped with a universal "[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" happens to unify within it the abstract structure theory of [[stable homotopy theory]] with the concrete richness of the [[differential topology]] of [[cobordism theory]] and of the [[arithmetic geometry]] of [[formal group laws]], such as [[elliptic curves]]. In the seminar we work through classical results in [[algebraic topology]], organized such as to give in the end a first glimpse of the modern picture of [[chromatic homotopy theory]]._

## Seminar) Complex oriented cohomology


**Outline.** We start with two classical topics of [[algebraic topology]] that first run independently in parallel:

* [S.1) Generalized cohomology](#S1GeneralizedCohomology)

* [S.2) Cobordism theory](#S2CobordismTheory)

The development of either of these happens to give rise to the concept of _[[spectra]]_ and via this concept it turns out that both topics are intimately related. The unification of both is our third topic

* [S.3) Complex oriented cohomology](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory)

$\,$

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96)).


### **S.1)** Generalized cohomology
 {#S1GeneralizedCohomology}

**Idea.** The concept that makes [[algebraic topology]] be about methods of [[homological algebra]] applied to [[topology]] is that of [[generalized homology]] and [[generalized cohomology]]: these are [[covariant functors]] or [[contravariant functors]], respectively,

$$
  Spaces \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from (sufficiently nice) [[topological spaces]] to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], such that a few key properties of the [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces is preserved as one passes them from [[Ho(Top)]] to the much more tractable [[abelian category]] [[Ab]].

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, chapters 7,8 and 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4, 4.2](#Kochman96), [Schwede 12, II.6](#Schwede12)) 


#### Generalized cohomology functors
 {#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors}

**Idea.** A [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is such a contravariant functor which satisfies the key properties exhibited by [[ordinary cohomology]] (as computed for instance by [[singular cohomology]]), notably [[homotopy invariance]] and [[excision]], _except_ that its value on the point is not required to be concentrated in degree 0. Dually for [[generalized homology]]. There are two versions of the axioms, one for [[reduced cohomology]], and they are equivalent if properly set up.

An important example of a generalised cohomology theory other than [[ordinary cohomology]] is [[topological K-theory]]. The other two examples of key relevance below are [[cobordism cohomology]] and [[stable cohomotopy]].

**Literature.** ([Switzer 75, section 7](#Switzer75), [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12 and section 9](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4](#Kochman96)).

##### Reduced cohomology


The traditional formulation of reduced generalized cohomology in terms of point-set topology is this:

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}
###### Definition

A **[[reduced cohomology theory]]** is 

1. a [[functor]]

   $$
     \tilde E^\bullet 
      \;\colon\; 
     (Top^{\ast/}_{CW})^{op} \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
   $$

   from the [[opposite category|opposite]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] ([[CW-complexes]]) to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]] ("[[cohomology groups]]"), in components

   $$
     \tilde E 
       \;\colon\; 
     (X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y)
       \mapsto
     (\tilde E^\bullet(Y) 
       \stackrel{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
     \tilde E^\bullet(X))
     \,,
   $$

1. {#SuspensionIsomorphismForReducedGeneralizedCohomology} equipped with a [[natural isomorphism]] of degree +1, to be called the **[[suspension isomorphism]]**, of the form

   $$
     \sigma_E
       \;\colon\;
     \tilde E^\bullet(-) 
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
     \tilde E^{\bullet +1}(\Sigma -) 
   $$

such that:

1. **([[homotopy invariance]])** If $f_1,f_2 \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ are two morphisms of pointed topological spaces such that there is a (base point preserving) [[homotopy]] $f_1 \simeq f_2$ between them, then the induced [[homomorphisms]] of abelian groups are [[equality|equal]] 

   $$
     f_1^\ast = f_2^\ast
     \,.
   $$

1. {#ReducedExactnessAxiom} **(exactness)** For $i \colon A \hookrightarrow X$ an inclusion of pointed topological spaces, with $j \colon X \longrightarrow Cone(i)$ the induced [[mapping cone]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ConeAndMappingCylinder)), then this gives an [[exact sequence]] of graded abelian groups

   $$
     \tilde E^\bullet(Cone(i)) 
      \overset{j^\ast}{\longrightarrow} 
     \tilde E^\bullet(X)
       \overset{i^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
     \tilde E^\bullet(A)
     \,.
   $$

=--

(e.g. [AGP 02, def. 12.1.4](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02))


This is equivalent (prop. \ref{HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent} below) to the following more succinct homotopy-theoretic definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyTheoretically}
###### Definition

A **reduced [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]]** is a [[functor]]

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet 
   \;\colon\; 
  Ho(Top^{\ast/})^{op} \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the pointed [[classical homotopy category]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ClassicalHomotopyCategory), [def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ClassicalPointedHomotopyCategory)), to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], and equipped with [[natural isomorphisms]], to be called the **[[suspension isomorphism]]** of the form

$$
  \sigma
    \;\colon\;
  \tilde E^{\bullet +1}(\Sigma -) 
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \tilde E^\bullet(-) 
$$

such that:

* **(exactness)** it takes [[homotopy cofiber]] sequences in $Ho(Top^{\ast/})$ ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyFiber)) to [[exact sequence|exact sequences]].


=--

As a consequence (prop. \ref{HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent} below), we find yet another equivalent definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyHomotopicalFunctor}
###### Definition

A **reduced [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]]** is a [[functor]]

  \tilde E^\bullet 
   \;\colon\; 
  (Top^{\ast/})^{op} \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of [[pointed topological spaces]] to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], such that 

* **(WHE)** it takes [[weak homotopy equivalences]] to isomorphisms

and equipped with [[natural isomorphism]], to be called the **[[suspension isomorphism]]** of the form

$$
  \sigma
    \;\colon\;

such that

+-- {: .num_prop #HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent}
###### Proposition

The three definitions 

* def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}  

* def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyTheoretically} 

* def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyHomotopicalFunctor} 

are indeed equivalent.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the equivalence of def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology} with def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyTheoretically}:

By the existence of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopQuillenModelStructure)), the characterization of its [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] ([cor.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyCategoryOfSubcategoriesOfModelCategoriesOnGoodObjects)) and the existence of [[CW-approximations]], the homotopy invariance axiom in def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology} is equivalent to the functor passing to the classical pointed homotopy category. In view of this and since on CW-complexes the standard topological mapping cone construction is a model for the [[homotopy cofiber]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#StandardTopologicalMappingConeIsHomotopyCofiber)), this gives the equivalence of the two versions of the exactness axiom.

Regarding the equivalence of def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyTheoretically} with def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyHomotopicalFunctor}:

This is the [[universal property]] of the [[classical homotopy category]]  ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory)) which identifies it  with the [[localization]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyCategoryOfACategoryWithWeakEquivalences)) of $Top^{\ast/}$ at the weak homotopy equivalences ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopQuillenModelStructure)), together with the existence of [[CW approximations]] ([rmk.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#EveryTopologicalSpaceWeaklyEquivalentToACWComplex)): jointly this says that, up to [[natural isomorphism]], there is a bijection between functors $F$ and $\tilde F$ in the following diagram (which is filled by a natural isomorphism itself):

$$
  \array{
    Top^{op} &\overset{F}{\longrightarrow}& Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\gamma_{Top}}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde F}}
    \\
    Ho(Top)^{op}\simeq (Top_{CW})/_\sim
  }
$$

where $F$ sends weak homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms and where $(-)_\sim$ means identifying homotopic maps.


=--

Prop. \ref{HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent} naturally suggests (e.g. [Lurie, section 1.4](#LurieHigherAlgebra)) that the concept of generalized cohomology be formulated in the generality of any abstract homotopy theory ([[model category]]), not necessarily that of (pointed) topological spaces:

+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ModelCategory)) with $\mathcal{C}^{\ast/}$ its [[slice model structure|pointed model category]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ModelStructureOnSliceCategory)). 

A **reduced additive [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]] ** on $\mathcal{C}$ is 

1. a [[functor]]

   $$
     \tilde E^\bullet \;\colon \; Ho(\mathcal{C}^{\ast/})^{op} \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
   $$

1. a [[natural isomorphism]] ("[[suspension isomorphisms]]") of degree +1

   $$
     \sigma \; \colon \; \tilde E^\bullet \longrightarrow \tilde E^{\bullet+1} \circ \Sigma
   $$

such that 

* **(exactness)** $\tilde E^\bullet$ takes [[homotopy cofiber sequences]] to [[exact sequences]].

=--

Finally we need the following terminology:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Let $\tilde E^\bullet$ be a [[reduced cohomology theory]] according to either of def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyTheoretically}, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyHomotopicalFunctor} or def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}.

We say $\tilde E^\bullet$ is **additive** if in addition

* {#WedgeAxiom} **([[wedge axiom]])** For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I} $ any set of pointed CW-complexes, then the canonical morphism

  $$
    \tilde E^\bullet(\vee_{i \in I} X_i) 
    \longrightarrow
    \prod_{i \in I} \tilde E^\bullet(X_i)
  $$

  from the functor applied to their [[wedge sum]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#WedgeSumAsCoproduct)), to the [[product]] of its values on the wedge summands, is an [[isomorphism]].

We say $\tilde E^\bullet$ is **ordinary** if its value on the [[0-sphere]] $S^0$ is concentrated in degree 0:

* **(Dimension)**  $\tilde E^{\bullet\neq 0}(\mathbb{S}^0) \simeq 0$.

If $\tilde E^\bullet$ is not ordinary, one also says that it is **generalized** or **extraordinary**.

A **[[homomorphism]] of reduced cohomology theories**

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; \tilde E^\bullet \longrightarrow \tilde F^\bullet
$$

is a [[natural transformation]] between the underlying functors which is compatible with the suspension isomorphisms in that all the following [[commuting square|squares commute]]

$$
  \array{
    \tilde E^\bullet(X) &\overset{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow}&  \tilde F^\bullet(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\sigma_E}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_F}}
    \\
    \tilde E^{\bullet + 1}(\Sigma X) 
    &\overset{\eta_{\Sigma X}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \tilde F^{\bullet + 1}(\Sigma X)
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

We now discuss some constructions and consequences implied by the concept of reduced cohomology theories:

+-- {: .num_defn #ConnectinHomomorphismForCohomologyTheoryOnInfinityCategory}
###### Definition

Given a generalized cohomology theory $(E^\bullet,\delta)$ on some $\mathcal{C}$ as in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}, and given a [[homotopy cofiber sequence]] in $\mathcal{C}$ ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LongFiberSequence)),

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} Z
  \stackrel{coker(g)}{\longrightarrow}
  \Sigma X
  \,,
$$

then the corresponding **[[connecting homomorphism]]** is the composite

$$
  \partial 
    \;\colon\; 
  E^\bullet(X)
   \stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow}
  E^{\bullet+1}(\Sigma X)
   \stackrel{coker(g)^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  E^{\bullet+1}(Z)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #LongExactSequenceOfACohomologyTheoryOnAnInfinityCategory}
###### Proposition

The [[connecting homomorphisms]] of def. \ref{ConnectinHomomorphismForCohomologyTheoryOnInfinityCategory} are parts of [[long exact sequences]]

$$
  \cdots
   \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow}
  E^{\bullet}(Z) 
    \longrightarrow 
  E^\bullet(Y) 
    \longrightarrow 
  E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow}
  E^{\bullet+1}(Z)
   \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the defining exactness of $E^\bullet$, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}, and the way this appears in def. \ref{ConnectinHomomorphismForCohomologyTheoryOnInfinityCategory}, using that $\sigma$ is by definition an isomorphism.

=--



##### Unreduced cohomology

Given a reduced [[generalized cohomology theory]] as in def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}, we may "un-reduce" it and evaluate it on unpointed topological spaces $X$ simply by evaluating it on $X_+$ ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#BasePointAdjoined)). It is conventional to further generalize to [[relative cohomology]] and evaluate on unpointed subspace inclusions $i \colon A \hookrightarrow X$, taken as placeholders for their [[mapping cones]] $Cone(i_+)$ ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#UnreducedMappingConeAsReducedConeOfBasedPointAdjoined)).

In the following a _pair_ $(X,U)$ refers to a [[subspace]] inclusion of [[topological spaces]]  $U \hookrightarrow X$.  Whenever only one space is mentioned, the subspace is assumed to be the [[empty set]] $(X, \emptyset)$. Write $Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow}$ for the category of such pairs (the [[full subcategory]] of the [[arrow category]] of $Top_{CW}$ on the inclusions). We identify $Top_{CW} \hookrightarrow Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow}$ by $X \mapsto (X,\emptyset)$.

+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralizedCohomologyTheory}
###### Definition

A _[[cohomology theory]]_ (unreduced, [[relative cohomology|relative]]) is 

1. a [[functor]]

   $$
     E^\bullet : (Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow})^{op} \to Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
   $$

   to the category of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], 

1. {#ConnectingHomomorphismOfUnreducedCohomology} a [[natural transformation]] of degree +1, to be called the **[[connecting homomorphism]]**, of the form

   $$
     \delta_{(X,A)} 
       \;\colon\;  
     E^\bullet(A, \emptyset) \to E^{\bullet + 1}(X, A)
     \,.
   $$ 

such that:

1. **(homotopy invariance)** For $f \colon (X_1,A_1) \to (X_2,A_2)$ a [[homotopy equivalence]] of pairs, then 

   $$
     E^\bullet(f) 
      \;\colon\; 
     E^\bullet(X_2,A_2) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E^\bullet(X_1,A_1)
   $$

   is an [[isomorphism]];

1. {#ExactnessUnreduced} **(exactness)** For $A \hookrightarrow X$ the induced sequence

   $$ 
     \cdots 
       \to 
     E^n(X, A) 
       \longrightarrow 
     E^n(X) 
       \longrightarrow
     E^n(A) 
       \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow} 
     E^{n+1}(X, A) 
       \to 
     \cdots 
   $$

   is a [[long exact sequence]] of [[abelian groups]].

1. **([[excision]])** For $U \hookrightarrow A \hookrightarrow X$ such that $\overline{U} \subset Int(A)$, then the natural inclusion of the pair $i \colon (X-U, A-U) \hookrightarrow (X, A)$ induces an isomorphism 

   $$
     E^\bullet(i) 
      \;\colon\; 
     E^n(X, A)
      \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     E^n(X-U, A-U)  
   $$

We say $E^\bullet$ is **additive** if it takes [[coproducts]] to [[products]]:

* {#UnreducedAdditivity} **(additivity)** If $(X, A) = \coprod_i (X_i, A_i)$ is a [[coproduct]], then the canonical comparison morphism 

  $$
    E^n(X, A) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \prod_i E^n(X_i, A_i)
  $$

  is an [[isomorphism]] from the value on $(X,A)$ to the [[product]] of values on the summands.

We say $E^\bullet$ is **ordinary** if its value on the point is concentrated in degree 0

* **(Dimension)**: $E^{\bullet \neq 0}(\ast,\emptyset) = 0$.

A [[homomorphism]] of unreduced cohomology theories 

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; E^\bullet \longrightarrow F^\bullet
$$

is a [[natural transformation]] of the underlying functors that is compatible with the connecting homomorphisms, hence such that all these [[commuting square|squares commute]]:

$$

     E^\bullet(A,\emptyset) &\overset{\eta_{(A,\emptyset)}}{\longrightarrow}& F^\bullet(A,\emptyset)

     \\
     E^{\bullet +1}(X,A)

     F^{\bullet +1}(X,A)

e.g. ([AGP 02, def. 12.1.1 ](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)). 


+-- {: .num_defn #AlternativeFormulationOfExcisionAxiom}
###### Lemma

The excision axiom in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} is equivalent to the following statement:

For all $A,B \hookrightarrow X$ with $X = Int(A) \cup Int(B)$, then the inclusion

$$
  i \colon (A, A \cap B) \longrightarrow (X,B) 
$$

induces an isomorphism,

$$
  i^\ast 
    \;\colon\;
  E^\bullet(X, B)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(A, A \cap B)
$$

=--

(e.g [Switzer 75, 7.2](#Switzer75))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, suppose that $E^\bullet$ satisfies the original excision axiom. Given $A,B$ with $X = \Int(A) \cup Int(B)$, set $U \coloneqq X-A$ and observe that 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     \overline{U} 
        & = \overline{X-A} 
     \\ & = X- Int(A)
     \\ & \subset Int(B)
  \end{aligned}
$$

and that

$$
  (X-U, B-U) = (A, A \cap B)
  \,.
$$

Hence the excision axiom implies $  E^\bullet(X, B) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E^\bullet(A, A \cap B)$. 

Conversely, suppose $E^\bullet$ satisfies the alternative condition. Given $U \hookrightarrow A \hookrightarrow X$ with $\overline{U} \subset Int(A)$, observe that we have a cover

$$
  \begin{aligned}
          Int(X-U) \cup Int(A) 
      & = (X - \overline{U}) \cap \Int(A)
   \\ & \supset (X - Int(A)) \cap Int(A)
   \\ & = X   
  \end{aligned}
$$

and that

$$
  (X-U, (X-U) \cap A) = (X-U, A - U)
  \,.
$$

Hence

$$
  E^\bullet(X-U,A-U)
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(X-U, (X-U)\cap A)
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(X,A)
  \,.
$$

The following lemma shows that the dependence in pairs of spaces in a generalized cohomology theory is really a stand-in for evaluation on [[homotopy cofibers]] of inclusions.

+-- {: .num_lemma #EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient}
###### Lemma

Let $E^\bullet$ be an cohomology theory, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory}, and let $A \hookrightarrow X$. Then there is an isomorphism 

$$
  E^\bullet(X,A)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X \cup Cone(A), \ast)
$$

between the value of $E^\bullet$ on the pair $(X,A)$ and its value on the unreduced [[mapping cone]] of the inclusion ([rmk.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#UnreducedCone)), relative to a basepoint.

If moreover $A \hookrightarrow X$ is (the [[retract]] of) a [[relative cell complex]] inclusion, then also the morphism in cohomology induced from the [[quotient]] map $p \;\colon\; (X,A)\longrightarrow (X/A, \ast)$ is an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  E^\bullet(p)
    \;\colon\; 
  E^\bullet(X/A,\ast)
    \longrightarrow
  E^\bullet(X,A)
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g [AGP 02, corollary 12.1.10](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider $U \coloneqq (Cone(A)-A \times \{0\}) \hookrightarrow Cone(A)$, the cone on $A$ minus the base $A$. We have

$$
  ( X\cup Cone(A)-U, Cone(A)-U) \simeq (X,A)
$$

and hence the first isomorphism in the statement is given by the excision axiom followed by homotopy invariance (along the contraction of the cone to the point).

Next consider the quotient of the [[mapping cone]] of the inclusion:

$$
  ( X\cup Cone(A), Cone(A) ) \longrightarrow (X/A,\ast)
  \,.

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a cofibration, then this is a [[homotopy equivalence]] since $Cone(A)$ is contractible and since by the dual [[factorization lemma]] ([lem.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#FactorizationLemma)) and by the invariance of homotopy fibers under weak equivalences ([lem.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#FiberOfFibrationIsCompatibleWithWeakEquivalences)), $X \cup Cone(A)\to X/A$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, hence, by the universal property of the [[classical homotopy category]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory)) a homotopy equivalence on CW-complexes.

The constructions of def. \ref{ReducedToUnreducedGeneralizedCohomology} and def. \ref{FromUnreducedToReducedCohomology} constitute a pair of [[functors]] between then [[categories]] of reduced cohomology theories, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology} and unreduced cohomology theories, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} which exhbit an [[equivalence of categories]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

(...careful with checking the respect for suspension iso and connecting homomorphism..)

To see that there are [[natural isomorphisms]] relating the two composites of these two functors to the identity:

One composite is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^\bullet 
    & \mapsto
    (\tilde E^\bullet \colon (X,x) \mapsto E^\bullet(X,\{x\})) 
    \\
    & \mapsto
    ((E')^\bullet \colon (X,A) \mapsto E^\bullet( X_+ \cup Cone(A_+) ), \ast)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have, from the construction, the reduced mapping cone of the original inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ with a base point adjoined. That however is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the original inclusion ([prop. ](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory -- P#UnreducedMappingConeAsReducedConeOfBasedPointAdjoined)). With this the natural isomorphism is given by lemma \ref{EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient}.

The other composite is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet
     & \mapsto
    (E^\bullet \colon (X,A) \mapsto \tilde E^\bullet(X_+ \cup Cone(A_+)))
    \\
    & \mapsto 
    ((\tilde E')^\bullet \colon X \mapsto \tilde E^\bullet(X_+ \cup Cone(*_+)))
  \end{aligned}
$$

where on the right we have the reduced mapping cone of the point inclusion with a point adoined. As before, this is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the point inclusion. That finally is clearly homotopy equivalent to $X$, and so now the natural isomorphism follows with homotopy invariance.
 
=--

Finally we record the following basic relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology:

+-- {: .num_prop #UnreducedCohomologyIsReducedPlusPointValue}
###### Proposition

Let $E^\bullet$ be an unreduced cohomology theory, and $\tilde E^\bullet$ its reduced cohomology theory from def. \ref{FromUnreducedToReducedCohomology}. For $(X,\ast)$ a pointed topological space, then there is an identification

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \simeq \tilde E^\bullet(X) \oplus E^\bullet(\ast)
$$

of the unreduced cohomology of $X$ with the [[direct sum]] of the reduced cohomology of $X$ and the unreduced cohomology of the base point.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The pair $\ast \hookrightarrow X$ induces the sequence

$$
  \cdots
   \to 
  E^{\bullet-1}(\ast)
    \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X) 
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(\ast)
    \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^{\bullet+1}(X)
    \to
  \cdots
$$

which by the exactness clause in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} is [[exact sequence|exact]]. 

Now since the composite $\ast \to X \to \ast$ is the identity, the morphism 
$E^\bullet(X) \to E^\bullet(\ast)$ has a [[section]] and so is in particular an [[epimorphism]]. Therefore, by exactness, the [[connecting homomorphism]] vanishes, $\delta = 0$ and we have a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 
    \to 
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X) 
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(\ast)
    \to
  0
$$

with the right map an epimorphism. Hence this is a [[split exact sequence]] and the statement follows.

and equipped with a [[natural isomorphism]] of degree +1, to be called the **[[suspension isomorphism]]**, of the form

$$
  \sigma
    \;\colon\;

such that:

1. **([[homotopy invariance]])** If $f_1,f_2 \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ are two morphisms of pointed topological spaces such that there is a (base point preserving) [[homotopy]] $f_1 \simeq f_2$ between them, then the induced [[homomorphisms]] of abelian groups are [[equality|equal]] 

   $$

      \overset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow} 
     \tilde E_\bullet(X)
       \overset{j_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
     \tilde E_\bullet(Cone(i)) 
     \,.

We say $\tilde E_\bullet$ is **additive** if in addition

  $$

  from the [[direct sum]] of the value on the summands to the value on the [[wedge sum]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory -- P#WedgeSumAsCoproduct)), is an [[isomorphism]].

We say $\tilde E_\bullet$ is **ordinary** if its value on the [[0-sphere]] $S^0$ is concentrated in degree 0:

* **(Dimension)**  $\tilde E_{\bullet\neq 0}(\mathbb{S}^0) \simeq 0$.

$$

###### Proposition

Let $(E,\mu,1)$ be a multiplicative cohomology theory, def. \ref{MultiplicativeCohomologyTheory}. Then

1. For every space $X$ the [cup product](#InternalMultiplicationOfMultiplicativeCohomologyTheory) gives $E^\bullet(X)$ the structure of a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded ring]], which is graded-commutative if $(E,\mu,1)$ is commutative.

1. For every pair $(X,A)$ the external multiplication $\mu$ gives $E^\bullet(X,A)$ the structure of a left and right [[module]] over the graded ring $E^\bullet(\ast)$.

1. All pullback morphisms respect the left and right action of $E^\bullet(\ast)$ and the connecting homomorphisms respect the right action and the left action up to multiplication by $(-1)^{n_1}$

###### Proof

Regarding the third point:

For pullback maps this is the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the external product: let $f \colon (X,A) \longrightarrow (Y,B)$ be a morphism in $Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow}$ then naturality says that the following square commutes:

$$
  \array{
    E^{n_1}(\ast) \otimes E^{n_2}(Y,B)
    &\overset{\mu_{n_1,n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E^{n_1 + n_2}(Y, B)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(id,f^\ast)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^\ast}}
    \\
    E^{n_1}(\ast) \otimes E^{n_2}(X,A)
    &\overset{\mu_{n_1,n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    E^{n_1 + n_2}(Y,B)
  }
  \,.
$$

For connecting homomorphisms this is the (graded) commutativity of the squares in def. \ref{MultiplicativeCohomologyTheory}:

$$
  \array{
    E^{n_1}(\ast)\otimes E^{n_2}(A)
      &\overset{(-1)^{n_1} (id, \delta)}{\longrightarrow}&

#### Brown representability theorem
 {#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem}


**Idea.** Given any [[functor]] such as the generalized (co)homology functor [above](#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors), an important question to ask is whether it is a _[[representable functor]]_. Due to the $\mathbb{Z}$-grading and the [[suspension isomorphisms]], if a generalized (co)homology functor is representable at all, it must be represented by a $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] such that the [[reduced suspension]] of one is comparable to the next one in the list. This is a _[[spectrum]]_ or more specifically: a _[[sequential spectrum]]_ .

Whitehead observed that indeed every [[spectrum]] represents a generalized (co)homology theory.  The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ states that, conversely, every generalized (co)homology theory is represented by a spectrum, subject to conditions of additivity.

As a first application, [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]] representing [[ordinary cohomology]] may be characterized via Brown representability.

**Literature.** ([Switzer 75, section 9](#Switzer75), [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4](#Kochman96))

###### Remark

A key subtlety in theorem \ref{BrownRepresentabilityForTraditionalBrownFunctors} is the restriction to _connected_ pointed topological spaces in def. \ref{BrownFunctorTraditional}. This comes about since the proof of the theorem requires that continuous functions $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ that induce isomorphisms on pointed homotopy classes 

$$
  [S^n,X]_\ast \longrightarrow [S^n,Y]_\ast
$$

for all $n$ are [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (For instance in [AGP 02](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02) this is used in the proof of theorem 12.2.19 there). But $[S^n,X]_\ast = \pi_n(X,x)$ gives the $n$th [[homotopy group]] of $X$ _only_ for the canonical basepoint, while for a weak homotopy equivalence in general one needs to consider the homotopy groups at all possible basepoints, at least one for each connected component. But so if one does assume that all spaces involved are connected, hence only have one connected component, then indeed weak homotopy equivalences are equivalently those maps  $X\to Y$ making all the $[S^n,X]_\ast \longrightarrow [S^n,Y]_\ast$ into isomorphisms.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If it were not for the connectedness clause in def. \ref{BrownFunctorTraditional} (remark \ref{ConnectivityInTraditionalBrownRepresentability}), then theorem \ref{BrownRepresentabilityForTraditionalBrownFunctors} with prop. \ref{EveryComponentOfAdditiveReducedCohomologyIsBrownFunctor} would immediately give the existence of the $\{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the remaining statement would follow immediately with the [[Yoneda lemma]], which says in particular that morphisms between [[representable functors]] are in [[natural bijection]] with the morphisms of objects that represent them.

The argument with the connectivity condition in Brown representability taken into account is essentially the same, just with a little bit more care:

For $X$ a [[pointed topological space]], write $X^{(0)}$ for the connected component of its basepoint. Observe that the [[loop space]] of a pointed topological space only depends on this connected component:

$$
  \Omega X \simeq \Omega (X^{(0)})
  \,.
$$

Now for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, to show that $\tilde E^n(-)$ is representable by some $E_n \in Ho(Top^{\ast/})$, use first that the restriction of $\tilde E^{n+1}$ to connected spaces is represented by some $E_{n+1}^{(0)}$. Observe that the [[reduced suspension]] of any $X \in Top^{\ast/}$ lands in $Top_{\geq 1}^{\ast/}$. Therefore the $(\Sigma\dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunction]] isomorphism ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SuspensionAndLoopAreAdjointOnHomotopyCategory)) implies that $\tilde E^{n+1}(\Sigma(-))$ is represented on _all_ of $Top^{\ast/}$ by $\Omega E_{n+1}^{(0)}$:

$$
  \tilde E^{n+1}(\Sigma X)
    \simeq
  [\Sigma X, E_{n+1}^{(0)}]_\ast
    \simeq
  [X, \Omega E_{n+1}^{(0)}]_\ast
    \simeq
  [X, \Omega E_{n+1}]_\ast
  \,,
$$

where $E_{n+1}$ is any pointed topological space with the given connected component $E_{n+1}^{(0)}$.
 
Now the [suspension isomorphism](#SuspensionIsomorphismForReducedGeneralizedCohomology) of $\tilde E$ says that $E_n \in Ho(Top^{\ast/})$ representing $\tilde E^n$ exists and is given by $\Omega E_{n+1}^{(0)}$:

$$
  \tilde E^n(X) \simeq \tilde E^{n+1}(\Sigma, X)\simeq [X,\Omega E_{n+1}]
$$

for any $E_{n+1}$ with connected component $E_{n+1}^{(0)}$.

This completes the proof. Notice that running the same argument next for $(n+1)$ gives a representing space $E_{n+1}$ such that its connected component of the base point is $E_{n+1}^{(0)}$ found before. And so on.

This abstract homotopy-theoretic proof uses the general concept of [[homotopy colimits]] in [[model categories]] as well as the concept of [[derived hom-spaces]] ("[[(∞,1)-category|∞-categories]]").

So while $\{S^n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ generates all of the homotopy theory of $Top^{\ast/}$, the latter is _not_ an example of def. \ref{CompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} due to the failure of $S^0$ to have [[cogroup]] structure.

###### Proposition

In a  homotopy theory compactly generated by cogroup objects $\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ closed under forming suspensions, according to def. \ref{CompactGenerationByCogroupObjects}, a morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]] precisely if for each $i \in I$ the induced function of maps in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]]

$$
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i,f)
   \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i,X)
   \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i,Y)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]] (a [[bijection]]).

=--

([Lurie, p. 114, Lemma star](#LurieHigherAlgebra))

+-- {: .proof }
###### Proof

By the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma|∞-Yoneda lemma]], the morphism $f$ is a weak equivalence precisely if for all objects $A \in \mathcal{C}$  the induced morphism of [[derived hom-spaces]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}(A,f)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(A,X)
   \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}(A,Y)
$$

is an equivalence in $Top_{Quillen}$. By assumption of compact generation and since the hom-functor $\mathcal{C}(-,-)$ sends [[homotopy colimits]] in the first argument to [[homotopy limits]], this is the case precisely already if it is the case for $A \in \{S_i\}_{i \in I}$.

Now the maps

$$
  \mathcal{C}(S_i,f)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(S_i,X)
   \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}(S_i,Y)
$$

are weak equivalences in $Top_{Quillen}$ if they are [[weak homotopy equivalences]], hence if they induce [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n$ for **all basepoints**.

It is this last condition of testing on all basepoints that the assumed [[cogroup]] structure on the $S_i$ allows to do away with: this cogroup structure implies that $\mathcal{C}(S_i,-)$ has the structure of an $H$-group, and this implies (by group multiplication), that all [[connected components]] have the same homotopy groups, hence that all homotopy groups are independent of the choice of basepoint, up to isomorphism.

Therefore the above morphisms are equivalences precisely if they are so under applying $\pi_n$ based on the connected component of the [[zero morphism]]

$$
  \pi_n\mathcal{C}(S_i,f)
    \;\colon\;
  \pi_n \mathcal{C}(S_i,X)
     \longrightarrow
  \pi_n\mathcal{C}(S_i,Y)
  \,.
$$

Now in this pointed situation we may use that 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_n \mathcal{C}(-,-) & \simeq \pi_0 \mathcal{C}(-,\Omega^n(-)) 
    \\
    & \simeq \pi_0\mathcal{C}(\Sigma^n(-),-)
    \\
    & \simeq Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n(-),-)
  \end{aligned}
$$

to find that $f$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{C}$ precisely if the induced morphisms

$$
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n S_i, f)
    \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n S_i,X)
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n S_i,Y)
$$

are isomorphisms for all $i \in I$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Finally by the assumption that each suspension $\Sigma^n S_i$ of a generator is itself among the set of generators, the claim follows.

To see this, first notice that we may directly find an extension $\eta_0$ along a map $X\to X_o$ such as to make a [[surjection]]: simply take $X_0$ to be the [[coproduct]] of **all** possible elements in the codomain and take

$$
  \eta_0
  \;\colon\;
   X 
     \sqcup
   \left(
     \underset{{i \in I,} \atop {\gamma \colon S_i \stackrel{}{\to} F}}{\coprod} 
     S_i
   \right)
   \longrightarrow
   F
$$

to be the canonical map. (Using that $F$, by assumption, turns coproducts into products, we may indeed treat the coproduct in $\mathcal{C}$ on the left as the coproduct of the corresponding functors.)

To turn the surjection thus constructed into a bijection, we now successively form quotients of $X_0$. To that end proceed by [[induction]] and suppose that $\eta_n \colon X_n \to F$ has been constructed. Then for $i \in I$ let

$$
  K_i 
    \coloneqq 
  ker
  \left( 
     Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i, X_n) 
        \stackrel{\eta_n \circ (-)}{\longrightarrow} 
     F(S_i) 
   \right)
$$

be the [[kernel]] of  $\eta_n$ evaluated on $S_i$. These $K_i$ are the pieces that need to go away in order to make a bijection. Hence define $X_{n+1}$ to be their joint [[homotopy cofiber]]

$$
  X_{n+1} 
     \coloneqq 
   coker\left(
     \left(
        \underset{{i \in I,} \atop {\gamma \in K_i}}{\sqcup} S_i
     \right)
     \overset{(\gamma)_{{i \in I} \atop {\gamma\in K_i}}}{\longrightarrow}
     X_n
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then by the assumption that $F$ takes this homotopy cokernel to a [[weak limit|weak]] [[fiber]] (as in remark \ref{WeakPullbacks}), there exists an extension $\eta_{n+1}$ of $\eta_n$ along $X_n \to X_{n+1}$:

Then by the assumption that $F$ takes this homotopy cokernel to a [[weak limit|weak]] [[fiber]] (as in remark \ref{WeakPullbacks}), there exists an extension $\eta_{n+1}$ of $\eta_n$ along $X_n \to X_{n+1}$:

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      \underset{{i \in I}\atop {\gamma \in K_i}}{\sqcup} S_i
    \right)
    &\overset{(\gamma)_{{i \in I}\atop \gamma \in K_i}}{\longrightarrow}&
    X_n
    &\overset{\eta_n}{\longrightarrow}& F
    \\
    \downarrow &(po^{h})& \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \eta_{n+1}}}
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& X_{n+1}
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    && F(X_{n+1}) &\longrightarrow& \ast 
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\exists \eta_{n+1}}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{epi}} && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\overset{\eta_n}{\longrightarrow}& ker\left((\gamma^\ast\right)_{{i \in I} \atop {\gamma \in K_i}}) &\longrightarrow& \ast 
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{\eta_n}}\searrow& \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
    \\
    && F(X_n)
    &\underset{(\gamma^\ast)_{{i \in I} \atop {\gamma \in K_i}} }{\longrightarrow}&
    \underset{{i \in I}\atop {\gamma\in K_i}}{\prod}F(S_i)
  }
  \,.
$$

It is now clear that we want to take

$$
  X' \coloneqq \underset{\rightarrow}{\lim}_n X_n
$$

and extend all the $\eta_n$ to that colimit. Since we have no condition for evaluating $F$ on colimits other than pushouts, observe that this [[sequential colimit]] is equivalent to the following pushout:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_n
    &\longrightarrow& \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_{2n}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_{2n+1} &\longrightarrow& X'
  }
  \,,
$$

where the components of the top and left map alternate between the identity on $X_n$ and the above successor maps $X_n \to X_{n+1}$.
Now the excision property of $F$ applies to this pushout, and we conclude the desired  extension $\eta' \colon X' \to F$:

$$
  \array{
    && \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_n
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_{2n+1} &\longrightarrow& X' &\longleftarrow& \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_{2n}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{(\eta_{2n+1})_{n}}}\searrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exists \eta}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{(\eta_{2n})_n}}
    \\
    && F    
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    && F(X')
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\exists \eta}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{epi}}
    \\
    &\ast \overset{(\eta_n)_n}{\longrightarrow}& \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n F(X_n)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \underset{n}{\prod}F(X_{2n+1})
    && &&
    \underset{n}{\prod}(X_{2n})
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \underset{n}{\prod}F(X_n)
  }
  \,,
$$



It remains to confirm that this indeed  gives the desired bijection. Surjectivity is clear. For injectivity use that all the $S_i$ are, by assumption, [[compact object|compact]], hence they may be taken inside the [[sequential colimit]]:

$$
  \array{
    && X_{n(\gamma)}
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{ \exists \hat \gamma}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    S_i 
      &\overset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}&
    X' 
      = 
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n X_n
  }
  \,.
$$

With this, injectivity follows because by construction we quotiented out the kernel at each stage. Because suppose that $\gamma$ is taken to zero in $F(S_i)$, then by the definition of $X_{n+1}$ above there is a factorization of $\gamma$ through the point:

$$
  \array{
    0 \colon & S_i
    &\overset{\hat \gamma}{\longrightarrow}&
    X_{n(\gamma)}
    &\overset{\eta_n}{\longrightarrow}& F
    \\
    & \downarrow && \downarrow & 
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& X_{n(\gamma)+1}
    \\
    & && \downarrow
    \\
    & && X'
  }
$$

This concludes the proof of Lemma ($\star$).

Now apply the construction given by this lemma to the case 
$X_0 \coloneqq 0$ and the unique $\eta_0 \colon 0 \stackrel{\exists !}{\to} F$. Lemma $(\star)$ then produces an object $X'$ which represents $F$ on all the $S_i$, and we want to show that this $X'$ actually represents $F$ generally, hence that for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$ the function

$$
  \theta \coloneqq \eta'\circ (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(Y,X')
   \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  F(Y)
$$

is a [[bijection]].

First, to see that $\theta$ is surjective, we need to find a preimage of any $\rho \colon Y \to F$. Applying Lemma $(\star)$ to $(\eta',\rho)\colon X'\sqcup Y \longrightarrow F$ we get an extension $\kappa$ of this through some $X' \sqcup Y \longrightarrow Z$ and the morphism on the right of the following commuting diagram:

$$
  \array{
    Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,X') && \longrightarrow && Ho(\mathcal{C})(-, Z)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\eta'\circ(-)}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\kappa \circ (-)}}
    \\
    && F(-)
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover, Lemma $(\star)$ gives that evaluated on all $S_i$, the two diagonal morphisms here become isomorphisms. But then prop. \ref{WhiteheadTheoremForCompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} implies that $X' \longrightarrow Z$ is in fact an equivalence. Hence the component map $Y \to Z \simeq Z$ is a lift of $\kappa$ through $\theta$.

Second, to see that $\theta$ is injective, suppose $f,g \colon Y \to X'$ have the same image under $\theta$. Then consider their [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    Y \sqcup Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& Z
  }
$$
 
along the [[codiagonal]] of $Y$. Using that $F$ sends this to a [[weak pullback]] by assumption, we obtain an extension $\bar \eta$ of $\eta'$ along $X' \to Z$. Applying Lemma $(\star)$ to this gives a further extension $\bar \eta' \colon Z' \to Z$ which now makes the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,X') && \longrightarrow && Ho(\mathcal{C})(-, Z)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\eta'\circ(-)}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\bar \eta' \circ (-)}}
    \\
    && F(-)
  }
$$

such that the diagonal maps become isomorphisms when evaluated on the $S_i$. As before, it follows via prop. \ref{WhiteheadTheoremForCompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} that the morphism
$h \colon X' \longrightarrow Z'$ is an equivalence.

Since by this construction $h\circ f$ and $h\circ g$ are homotopic

$$
  \array{
    Y \sqcup Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\stackrel{h}{\simeq}}}
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& Z &\longrightarrow& Z'
  }
$$

it follows with $h$ being an equivalence that already $f$ and $g$ were homotopic, hence that they represented the same element.

$$

Here the outer vertical morphisms are [[isomorphisms]], as shown, due to the [[pasting law]] (see also at _[fiberwise recognition of stable homotopy pushouts](homotopy+pullback#FiberwiseRecognitionInStableCase)_). 
This means that the [[four lemma]] applies to this diagram. Inspection shows that this implies the claim.

#### Milnor exact sequence
 {#S2MilnorExactSequence}


**Idea.** One tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] via "[[inverse limits]]" are _[[Milnor exact sequences]]_. For instance the generalized cohomology of the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ plays a key role in the [[complex oriented cohomology]]-theory discussed [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory), and via the equivalence $B U(1) \simeq \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ to the [[homotopy type]] of the infinite [[complex projective space]] (def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}), which is the [[direct limit]] of finite dimensional projective spaces $\mathbb{C}P^n$, this is an [[inverse limit]] of the generalized cohomology groups of the $\mathbb{C}P^n$s. But what really matters here is the [[derived functor]] of the [[limit]]-operation -- the  [[homotopy limit]] -- and the [[Milnor exact sequence]] expresses how the naive limits receive corrections from higher "[[lim^1]]-terms". In practice one mostly proceeds by verifying conditions under which these corrections happen to disappear, these are the _[[Mittag-Leffler conditions]]_.

We need this for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

for the homomorphism from def. \ref{TheBoundaryMapDefiningLim1} regarded as the single non-trivial differential in a [[cochain complex]] of abelian groups.
Then by remark \ref{LimitAsKernelAnalogousToLim1} and def. \ref{Lim1ViaCokernel} we have $H^0(L(A_\bullet)) \simeq \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim} A_\bullet$ and $H^1(L(A_\bullet)) \simeq \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^1 A_\bullet$.

With this, then for a short exact sequence of towers $0 \to A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet \to 0$ the long exact sequence in question is the [[long exact sequence in homology]] of the corresponding short exact sequence of complexes

###### Lemma

The category $Ab^{(\mathbb{N}, \geq)}$ of [[towers]] of [[abelian groups]] has [[enough injectives]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The functor $(-)_n \colon Ab^{(\mathbb{N}, \geq)} \to Ab$ that picks the $n$-th component of the tower has a [[right adjoint]] $r_n$, which sends an abelian group $A$ to the tower

$$
  r_n

    \cdots
    \to
    0
    \to

$$

Since $(-)_n$ itself is evidently an [[exact functor]], its right adjoint preserves injective objects ([prop.](injective+object#RightAdjointsOfExactFunctorsPreserveInjectives)). 

So with $A_\bullet \in Ab^{(\mathbb{N}, \geq)}$, let $A_n \hookrightarrow \tilde A_n$ be an injective resolution of the abelian group $A_n$, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then 

$$
  A_\bullet

By lemma \ref{TowersOfAbelianGroupsHasEnoughInjectives} there are [[enough injectives]] in $Ab^{(\mathbb{N}, \geq)}$. 
So for $A_\bullet \in Ab^{(\mathbb{N}, \geq)}$ the given tower of abelian groups, let 

$$

be an [[injective resolution]]. We need to show that 

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^1 A_\bullet
    \simeq
  ker(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}(j^2))/im(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}(j^1))

$$

Since limits preserve [[kernels]], this is equivalently

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^1 A_\bullet
    \simeq
  (\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}(ker(j^2)_\bullet))/im(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}(j^1))

###### Lemma

For $X_\bullet$ the sequence of stages of a ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[CW-complex]] $X = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n X_n$, then the canonical map

$$
  Tel(X_\bullet)
  \longrightarrow
  X
$$

from the [[mapping telescope]], def. \ref{MappingTelescope}, is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write in the following $Tel(X)$ for $Tel(X_\bullet)$ and write $Tel(X_n)$ for the mapping telescop of the substages of the finite stage $X_n$ of $X$. It is intuitively clear that each of the projections at finite stage

$$
  Tel(X_n) \longrightarrow X_n
$$

is a [[homotopy equivalence]], hence ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences)) a weak homotopy equivalence. A concrete construction of a homotopy inverse is given for instance in ([Switzer 75, proof of prop. 7.53](#Switzer75)).

Moreover, since spheres are [[compact object|compact]], so that elements of [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_q(Tel(X))$ are represented at some finite stage $\pi_q(Tel(X_n))$ it follows that 

$$
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_q(Tel(X_n)) 
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \pi_q(Tel(X))
$$

are [[isomorphisms]] for all $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and all choices of basepoints (not shown). 

Together these two facts imply that in the following commuting square, three morphisms are isomorphisms, as shown.

$$
  \array{
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_q(Tel(X_n))
    &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_q(Tel(X))
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_q(X_n)
    &\underset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_q(X)    
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore also the remaining morphism is an isomorphism ([[two-out-of-three]]). Since this holds for all $q$ and all basepoints, it is a weak homotopy equivalence.

$$

be a [[tower of fibrations]] ([[Serre fibrations]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SerreFibration))). Then for each $q \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a [[short exact sequence]]

  \,,
$$

for $\pi_\bullet$ the [[homotopy group]]-functor (exact as [[pointed sets]] for $i = 0$, as [[groups]] for $i \geq 1$) which says that 

1. the failure of the [[limit]] over the homotopy groups of the stages of the tower to equal the homotopy groups of the [[limit]] of the tower is at most in the [[kernel]] of the canonical comparison map;

1. that kernel is the $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^1$ (def. \ref{Lim1ViaCokernel}) of the homotopy groups of the stages. 

=--

An elementary but tedious proof is indicated in ([Bousfield-Kan 72, chapter IX, theorem 3.1](lim1+#BousfieldKan72). The following is a neat [[model category]]-theoretic proof following ([Goerss-Jardine 96, section VI. prop. 2.15](#GoerssJardine96)), which however requires the concept of [[homotopy limit]] over towers.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With respect to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] or the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], a tower of fibrations as stated is a fibrant object in the injective [[model structure on functors]] $[(\mathbb{N},\geq), sSet]_{inj}$ ($[(\mathbb{N},\geq), Top]_{inj}$) ([prop](projectively+cofibrant+diagram#CofibrantCotowerDiagram)). Hence the plain [[limit]] over this diagram represents the [[homotopy limit]]. By the discussion there, up to weak equivalence that homotopy limit is also the pullback in 

$$
  \array{
    holim X_\bullet &\longrightarrow& \underset{n}{\prod} Path(X_n)
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{n}{\prod} X_n &\underset{(id,p_n)_n}{\longrightarrow}&
    \underset{n}{\prod} X_ n \times X_n
  }
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the product over all the canonical fibrations out of the [[path space objects]]. Hence also the left vertical morphism is a fibration, and so by taking its [[fiber]] over a basepoint, the [[pasting law]] gives a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \underset{n}{\prod} \Omega X_n
    \longrightarrow
  holim X_\bullet
    \longrightarrow
  \underset{n}{\prod} X_n
  \,.
$$


The [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] of this fiber sequence goes

$$
  \cdots
   \to
  \underset{n}{\prod} \pi_{q+1}(X_n)  
   \longrightarrow
  \underset{n}{\prod} \pi_{q+1}(X_n)
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_q (\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet)
    \longrightarrow
  \underset{n}{\prod} \pi_q(X_n)
    \longrightarrow
  \underset{n}{\prod} \pi_q(X_n)
   \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

Chopping that off by forming kernel and cokernel yields the claim for positive $q$. For $q = 0$ it follows by inspection.

For

  X_\bullet

    X_1

the sequence of stages of the ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[CW-complex]] $X = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n X_n$, write

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    A_X 
    &\coloneqq 
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} X_{2n} \times [2n,{2n}+1];
  \\
    B_X 
    &\coloneqq 
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} X_{(2n+1)} \times [2n+1,{2n}+2].
  \end{aligned}
$$

for the [[disjoint unions]] of the [[cylinders]] over all the stages in even and all those in odd degree, respectively.

These come with canonical inclusion maps into the [[mapping telescope]] $Tel(X_\bullet)$ ([def.](mapping+telescope#MappingTelescope)), which we denote by

$$
  \array{
    A_X && && B_X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_{A_x}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_{B_x}}}
    \\
    && Tel(X_\bullet)
  }
  \,.
$$

Observe that 

1. $A_X \cup B_X \simeq Tel(X_\bullet)$;

1. $A_X \cap B_X \simeq \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} X_n$;

and that there are [[homotopy equivalences]]

1. $A_X \simeq \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} X_{2n+1}$

1. $B_X \simeq \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} X_{2n}$

1. $Tel(X_\bullet) \simeq X$.

The first two are obvious, the third is [this proposition](mapping+telescope#TelescopeOfCWComplexEquivalentToTheOriginal). 

This implies that the [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]] ([prop.](generalized+cohomology#MayerVietorisSequenceInGeneralizedCohomology)) for $\tilde E^\bullet$ on the cover $A \sqcup B \to X$ is isomorphic to the bottom horizontal sequence in the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
     \tilde E^{\bullet-1}(A_X)\oplus \tilde E^{\bullet-1}(B_X)
      &\longrightarrow&
    \tilde E^{\bullet-1}(A_X \cap B_X)
      &\longrightarrow& 
    \tilde E^\bullet(X)
      &\overset{(\iota_{A_x})^\ast - (\iota_{B_x})^\ast}{\longrightarrow}&
    \tilde E^\bullet(A_X)\oplus \tilde E^\bullet(B_X)
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    \tilde E^\bullet(A_X \cap B_X)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
      &&
    {}^{\mathllap{(id, -id)}}\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \underset{n}{\prod}\tilde E^{\bullet-1}(X_n)
      &\underset{\partial}{\longrightarrow}&
    \underset{n}{\prod}\tilde E^{\bullet-1}(X_n) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    \tilde E^\bullet(X)
      &\overset{(i_n^\ast)_{n}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \underset{n}{\prod}\tilde E^\bullet(X_n)
      &\underset{\partial}{\longrightarrow}&
    \underset{n}{\prod}\tilde E^\bullet(X_n)
  }
  \,,
$$

hence that the bottom sequence is also a [[long exact sequence]].

To identify the morphism $\partial$, notice that it comes from pulling back $E$-cohomology classes along the inclusions $A \cap B \to A$ and $A\cap B \to B$. Comonentwise these are the inclusions of each $X_n$ into the left and the right end of its cylinder inside the [[mapping telescope]], respectively. By the construction of the [[mapping telescope]], one of these ends is embedded via $i_n \colon X_n \hookrightarrow X_{n+1}$ into the cylinder over $X_{n+1}$. In conclusion, $\partial$ acts by

$$
  \partial
    \;\colon\;
  (a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
    \mapsto
  ( a_n - i_n^\ast(a_{n+1}) )
  \,.
$$

(The relative sign is the one in $(\iota_{A_x})^\ast - (\iota_{B_x})^\ast$ originating in the definition of the [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]] and properly propagated to the bottom sequence while ensuring that $\tilde E^\bullet(X)\to \prod_n \tilde E^\bullet(X_n)$ is really $(i_n^\ast)_n$ and not $(-1)^n(i_n^\ast)_n$, as needed for the statement to be proven.)

This is the morphism from def. \ref{TheBoundaryMapDefiningLim1} for the sequence

$$
   \cdots
    \to 
  \tilde E^\bullet(X_{n+1}) 
    \overset{i_n^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^\bullet(X_n)
    \overset{i_n^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^{\bullet}(X_{n-1})
   \to
   \cdots
 \,.
$$

Hence truncating the above long exact sequence by forming kernel and cokernel of $\partial$, the result follows via remark \ref{LimitAsKernelAnalogousToLim1} and definition \ref{Lim1ViaCokernel}.

#### Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
 {#SerreAtiyahHirzebruchSpectralSequence}

**Idea.** Another important tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] is to reduce it to the computation of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]]. Given a [[generalized cohomology theory]] $E$, there is a [[spectral sequence]] known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_ (AHSS) which serves to compute $E$-cohomology of $F$-[[fiber bundles]] over a [[simplicial complex]] $X$ in terms of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the generalized cohomology $E^\bullet(F)$ of the fiber. For $E = $ [[HA]] this is known as the _[[Serre spectral sequence]]_.

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] in turn is a consequence of the "[[Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence]]" which arises from the [[exact couple]] of [[relative cohomology]] groups of the skeleta of the CW-complex, and whose first page is the relative cohomology groups for codimension-1 skeleta.

We need the AHSS for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

##### Converging spectral sequences

+-- {: .num_defn #CohomologySpectralSequence}
###### Definition

A **cohomology [[spectral sequence]]** $\{E_r^{p,q}, d_r\}$ is

1. a sequence $\{E_r^{\bullet,\bullet}\}$ (for $r \in \mathbb{N}$, $r \geq 1$) of [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]] (the "pages");

1. a sequence of [[linear maps]] (the "[[differentials]]") 

   $$
     \{d_r \;\colon\; E_r^{\bullet,\bullet} \longrightarrow E_r^{\bullet+r, \bullet-r+1}\}
   $$

such that 

* $H_{r+1}^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the [[cochain cohomology]] of $d_r$, i.e. $E_{r+1}^{\bullet, \bullet} = H(E_r^{\bullet,\bullet},d_r)$, for all $r \in \mathbb{N}$, $r \geq 1$.

Given a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian group]]_ $C^\bullet$ equipped with a decreasing [[filtration]]

$$
  C^\bullet \supset \cdots \supset F^s C^\bullet \supset F^{s+1} C^\bullet \supset \cdots \supset 0$$

such that

$$
  C^\bullet = \underset{s}{\cup} F^s C^\bullet \;\;\;\; and \;\;\;\; 0 = \underset{s}{\cap} F^s C^\bullet
$$

then the spectral sequence is said to **converge** to  $C^\bullet$, denoted, 

$$
  E_2^{\bullet,\bullet} \Rightarrow C^\bullet
$$

if

1.  in each bidegree $(s,t)$ the sequence $\{E_r^{s,t}\}_r$ eventually becomes constant on a group 

    $E_\infty^{s,t} \coloneqq E_{\gg 1}^{s,t}$;

1. $E_\infty^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the [[associated graded]] of the filtered $C^\bullet$ in that

   $E_\infty^{s,t} \simeq F^s C^{s+t} / F^{s+1}C^{s+t}$.


{#MultiplicativeSpectralSequence} The converging spectral sequence is called a **[[multiplicative spectral sequence]]** if 

1. $\{E_2^{\bullet,\bullet}\}$ is equipped with the structure of a [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[associative algebra|algebra]];

1. $F^\bullet C^\bullet$ is equipped with the structure of a filtered [[graded algebra]] ($F^p C^k \cdot F^q C^l \subset F^{p+q} C^{k+l}$);

such that

1. each $d_{r}$ is a [[derivation]] with respect to the (induced) algebra structure on ${E_r^{\bullet,\bullet}}$, graded of degree 1 with respect to total degree;

1. the multiplication on $E_\infty^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is compatible with that on $C^\bullet$.

+-- {: .num_defn #CohomologySpectralSequence}
###### Remark

The point of [[spectral sequences]] is that by subdividing the data in any [[graded abelian group]] $C^\bullet$ into filtration stages, with each stage itself subdivided into bidegrees, such that each consecutive stage depends on the previous one in way tightly controled by the bidegrees, then this tends to give much control on the computation of $C^\bullet$. For instance it often happens that one may argue that the differentials in some spectral sequence all vanish from some page on (one says that the spectral sequence _collapses_ at that page) by pure degree reasons, without any further computation.

**(cohomological spectral sequence of an exact couple)**

    && E_2

$$

is itself an exact couple. Accordingly there is induced a sequence of exact couples 

$$
  \array{
    D_r && \stackrel{g_r}{\longrightarrow} && D_r
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f_r}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{h_r}}

then $\{E_r^{\bullet,\bullet}, d_r\}$ with

$$

$$
  F^p G^\bullet \coloneqq ker(G^\bullet \to D^{p-1, \bullet - p+1})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By exactness of the exact couple, the [[kernel]]

$$
  ker(d_{r-1}) \coloneqq ker(h \circ g^{-r+2} \circ f)
$$

consists of those elements $x$ such that $g^{-r+2} (f(x)) = g(y)$, for some $y$, hence 

$$
  ker(d_{r-1}) = f^{-1}(g^{r-1}(D^{s+r-1,t-r+1}))
  \,.
$$

By assumption there is for each $(s,t)$ an $R$ such that for all $r \geq R$ then $ker(d_{r-1})$ is independent of $r$. 

Moreover, $im(d_{r-1})$ consists of the image under $h$ of those $x$ such that $g^{r-2}(x)$ is in the image of $f$, hence (by exactness of the exact couple) such that $g^{r-2}(x)$ is in the kernel of $g$, hence such that $x$ is in the kernel of $g^{r-1}$. If $r \gt R$ then by assumption $g^{r-1} = 0$ and so then $im(d_{r-1}) = im(h)$.

It follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E_\infty^{p,n-p}
    & =
    ker(d_R)/im(d_R)
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    f^{-1}(im(g^R))/im(h)
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    im(g^R) \cap im(f)
    \\
    & 
    \simeq
    im(g^R) \cap ker(g)
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in last two steps we used once more the exactness of the exact couple.

The last group is that of elements $x \in G^n$ which map to zero in $D^{p-1,n-p+1}$ and where two such are identified if they agree in $D^{p,n-p}$, hence indeed 

$$
  E_\infty^{p,n-p} \simeq F^p G^n / F^{p+1} G^n
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark #ExtensionProblemForSpectralSequences}
###### Remark

Given a [[spectral sequence]] (def. \ref{CohomologySpectralSequence}), then even if it converges strongly, computing its infinity-page still just gives the [[associated graded]] of the [[filtered object]] that it converges to, not the filtered object itself. The latter is in each filter stage an [[extension]] of the previous stage by the corresponding stage of the infinity-page, but there are in general several possible extensions (the trivial extension or some twisted extensions). The problem of determining these extensions and hence the problem of actually determining the filtered object from a spectral sequence converging to it is often referred to as the **extension problem**.

More in detail, consider, for definiteness, a cohomology spectral sequence converging to some [[filtered object|filtered]] $F^\bullet H^\bullet$

$$
  E^{p,q} \;\Rightarrow\; H^\bullet
  \,.
$$

Then by definition of convergence there are isomorphisms

$$
  E_\infty^{p,\bullet} \simeq F^p H^{p + \bullet} / F^{p+1} H^{p + \bullet}
  \,.
$$

Equivalently this means that there are [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to F^{p+1}H^{p +\bullet} \hookrightarrow F^p H^{p +\bullet} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{p,\bullet} \to 0
  \,.
$$

for all $p$. The extension problem then is to inductively deduce $F^p H^\bullet$ from knowledge of $F^{p+1}H^\bullet$ and $E_\infty^{p,\bullet}$.

In good cases these short exact sequences happen to be [[split exact sequences]], which means that the extension problem is solved by the [[direct sum]]

$$
  F^p H^{p+\bullet} \simeq F^{p+1} H^{p+\bullet} \oplus E_\infty^{p,\bullet}
  \,.
$$

But in general this need not be the case. 

One sufficient condition that these exact sequences split is that they consist of homomorphisms of $R$-[[modules]], for some [[ring]] $R$, and that $E_\infty^{p,\bullet}$ are [[projective modules]] (for instance [[free modules]]) over $R$. Because then the [[Ext]]-group $Ext^1_R(E_\infty^{p,\bullet},-)$ vanishes, and hence all extensions are trivial, hence split.

So for instance for every spectral sequence in [[vector spaces]] the extension problem is trivial (since every vector space is a free module).

##### The AHSS

The following proposition requires, in general, to evaluate cohomology functors not just on [[CW-complexes]], but on all topological spaces. Hence we invoke prop. \ref{HomotopyTheoreticVersionOfCohomologyFunctorDefIsEquivalent} to regard a [[reduced cohomology theory]] as a contravariant functor on all pointed topological spaces, which sends [[weak homotopy equivalences]] to isomorphisms (def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyHomotopicalFunctor}).


+-- {: .num_prop #AHSSExistence}
###### Proposition
**(Serre-Cartan-Eilenberg-Whitehead-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence)**

Let $A^\bullet$ be a an [additive](#UnreducedAdditivity)  unreduced  [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology functor]]  ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#ReducedGeneralizedCohomologyHomotopyHomotopicalFunctor)). Let $B$ be a [[CW-complex]] and let $X \stackrel{\pi}{\to} B$ be a [[Serre fibration]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SerreFibration)), such that all its [[fibers]] are [[weakly contractible topological space|weakly contractible]] or such that $B$ is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]. In either case all [[fibers]] are identified with a typical fiber $F$ up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]] by connectedness ([this example](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#FibersOfSerreFibrations)), and well defined up to unique iso in the homotopy category by simply connectedness: 

$$
  \array{
    F &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib_{cl}}}
    \\
    && B
  }
  \,.
$$

If at least one of the following two conditions is met

* $B$ is [[finite number|finite]]-dimensional as a [[CW-complex]];

* $A^\bullet(F)$ is bounded below in degree and the sequences $\cdots \to A^p(X_{n+1}) \to A^p(X_n) \to \cdots$ satisfy the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]] (def. \ref{MittagLefflerCondition}) for all $p$;

then there is a cohomology [[spectral sequence]], def. \ref{CohomologySpectralSequence}, whose $E_2$-page is the [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^\bullet(B,A^\bullet(F))$ of $B$ with [[coefficients]] in the $A$-[[cohomology groups]] $A^\bullet(F)$ of the fiber, and which converges to the $A$-cohomology groups of the total space

$$
  E_2^{p,q} 
    =

with respect to the filtering given by

  \,,
$$

where $X_{p} \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(B_{p})$ is the fiber over the $p$th stage of the [[CW-complex]] $B = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n B_n$.


=--

+-- {: .proof #ProofOfTheAHSS}
###### Proof

The [exactness axiom](#ExactnessUnreduced) for $A$ gives an [[exact couple]], def. \ref{ExactCoupleAndDerivedExactCouple}, of the form

$$
  \array{
    \underset{s,t}{\prod} A^{s+t}(X_{s})
    &&
      \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} 
    &&
    \underset{s,t}{\prod} A^{s+t}(X_{s})
    \\

  \left(
      \array{
        A^{s+t}(X_s) & \longrightarrow & A^{s+t}(X_{s-1})
        \\
        \uparrow && \downarrow_{\mathrlap{\delta}}
        \\
        A^{s+t}(X_s, X_{s-1}) && A^{s+t+1}(X_{s}, X_{s-1})
      }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where we take $X_{\gg 1} = X$ and $X_{\lt 0} = \emptyset$. 

In order to determine the $E_2$-page, we analyze the $E_1$-page: By definition

$$
  E_1^{s,t}
   =
  A^{s+t}(X_s, X_{s-1})
$$


Let $C(s)$ be the set of $s$-dimensional cells of $B$, and notice that for $\sigma \in C(s)$ then 

$$
  (\pi^{-1}(\sigma), \pi^{-1}(\partial \sigma)) \simeq (D^n, S^{n-1}) \times F_\sigma
  \,,
$$

where $F_\sigma$ is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to $F$ ([exmpl.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#FibersOfSerreFibrations)).
 
This implies that 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E_1^{s,t}
    & \coloneqq
    A^{s+t}(X_s, X_{s-1})
    \\
    & \simeq \tilde A^{s+t}(X_s/X_{s-1})
    \\
    & \simeq \tilde A^{s+t}(\underset{\sigma \in C(n)}{\vee} S^s \wedge F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} \tilde A^{s+t}(S^s \wedge F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} \tilde A^t(F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} A^t(F)
    \\
    & \simeq C^s_{cell}(B,A^t(F))
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used the relation to [[reduced cohomology]] $\tilde A$, prop. \ref{ReducedToUnreducedGeneralizedCohomology} together with lemma \ref{EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient}, 
then the [wedge axiom](#WedgeAxiom) and the [suspension isomorphism](#SuspensionIsomorphismForReducedGeneralizedCohomology) of the latter. 

The last group $C^s_{cell}(B,A^t(F))$ appearing in this sequence of isomorphisms is that of [[cellular cohomology|cellular cochains]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CellularChainComplex)) of degree $s$ on $B$ with [[coefficients]] in the group $A^t(F)$. 

Since [[cellular cohomology]] of a [[CW-complex]] agrees with its [[singular cohomology]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CelluarEquivalentToSingularFromSpectralSequence)), hence with its [[ordinary cohomology]], to conclude that the $E_2$-page is as claimed, it is now sufficient to show that the differential $d_1$ coincides with the differential in the [[cellular cochain complex]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CellularChainComplex)). 

We discuss this now for $\pi = id$, hence $X = B$ and $F = \ast$. The general case works the same, just with various factors of $F$ appearing in the following: 

Consider the following diagram, which [[commuting diagram|commutes]] due to the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the [connecting homomorphism](#ConnectingHomomorphismOfUnreducedCohomology) $\delta$ of $A^\bullet$:

$$
  \array{
    \partial^\ast
     \colon
    & C^{s-1}_{cell}(X,A^t(\ast))
      & =&  \underset{i \in I_{s-1}}{\prod} A^t(\ast)
      && \longrightarrow &&
    \underset{i \in I_s}{\prod} A^t(\ast)
    & = & 
    C_{cell}^{s}(X,A^t(\ast))
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    && & \underset{i \in I_{s-1}}{\prod} \tilde A^{s+t-1}(S^{s-1}) 
      && &&
    \underset{i \in I_s}{\prod} \tilde A^{s+t}(S^{s}) 
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    && d_1 \colon &
    A^{s+t-1}(X_{s-1}, X_{s-2})
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    A^{s+t-1}(X_{s-1})
      &\overset{\delta}{\longrightarrow}&
    A^{s+t}(X_s, X_{s-1})
    \\
    && & 
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && & 
    A^{s+t-1}(S^{s-1}, \emptyset)
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    A^{s+t-1}(S^{s-1})
      &\overset{\delta}{\longrightarrow}&
    A^{s+t}(D^s , S^{s-1})
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the bottom vertical morphisms are those induced from any chosen cell inclusion $(D^s , S^{s-1}) \hookrightarrow (X_s, X_{s-1})$.

The differential $d_1$ in the spectral sequence is the middle horizontal composite. From this the vertical isomorphisms give the top horizontal map. But the bottom horizontal map identifies this top horizontal morphism componentwise with the restriction to the boundary of cells. Hence the top horizontal morphism is indeed the coboundary operator $\partial^\ast$ for the [[cellular cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $A^\bullet(\ast)$ ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CellularChainComplex)). This cellular cohomology coincides with [[singular cohomology]] of the [[CW-complex]] $X$ ([thm.](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CelluarEquivalentToSingularFromSpectralSequence)), hence computes the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $X$.

Now to see the convergence. If $B$ is finite dimensional then the convergence condition as stated in prop. \ref{CohomologicalSpectralSequenceOfAnExactCouple} is met.  Alternatively, if $A^\bullet(F)$ is bounded below in degree, then by the above analysis the $E_1$-page has a horizontal line below which it vanishes. Accordingly the same is then true for all higher pages, by each of them being the cohomology of the previous page. Since the differentials go right and down, eventually they pass beneath this vanishing line and become 0. This is again the condition needed in the proof of prop. \ref{CohomologicalSpectralSequenceOfAnExactCouple} to obtain convergence. 

By that proposition the convergence is to the [[inverse limit]]

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}
  \left(
    \cdots \stackrel{}{\to} A^\bullet(X_{s+1}) \longrightarrow A^\bullet(X_{s})
    \to \cdots
  \right)
  \,.
$$

If $X$ is finite dimensional or more generally if the sequences that this limit is over satisfy the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]] (def. \ref{MittagLefflerCondition}), then this limit is $A^\bullet(X)$, by prop. \ref{Lim1VanihesUnderMittagLeffler}.

### **S.2)** Cobordism theory
 {#S2CobordismTheory}

**Idea.** As one passes from [[abelian groups]] to [[spectra]], a miracle happens: even though the latter are just the proper embodiment of [[linear algebra]] in the context of [[homotopy theory]] ("[[higher algebra]]") their inspection reveals that spectra natively know about deep phenomena of [[differential topology]], [[index theory]] and in fact [[string theory]] (for instance via a close relation between _[[genera and partition functions - table|genera and partition functions]]_). 

A strong manifestation of this phenomenon comes about in [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]/[[chromatic homotopy theory]] that we eventually come to [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory). It turns out to be higher algebra over the complex Thom spectrum [[MU]]. 

Here we first concentrate on its real avatar, the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MO]]. The seminal result of [[Thom's theorem]] says that the [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[MO]] form the [[cobordism ring]] of [[cobordism]]-[[equivalence classes]] of [[manifolds]]. In the course of discussing this _[[cobordism theory]]_ one encounters various phenomena whose complex version also governs the complex oriented cohomology theory that we are interested in [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory).

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, chapter I and sections II.2, II6](Kochman96)). A quick efficient account is in ([Malkiewich 11](#Malkiewich11)). See also ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 11](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)).


#### Classifying spaces and $G$-Structure 
 {#ClassifyingSpaces}

**Idea.** Every [[manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ carries a canonical [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n$: its [[tangent bundle]]. There is a [[universal vector bundle]] of rank $n$, of which all others arise by [[pullback]], up to [[isomorphism]]. The base space of this universal bundle is hence called the [[classifying space]] and denoted $B GL(n) \simeq B O(n)$ (for $O(n)$ the [[orthogonal group]]). This may be realized as the [[homotopy type]] of a [[direct limit]] of [[Grassmannian manifolds]]. In particular the tangent bundle of a manifold $X$ is classified by a map $X \longrightarrow B O(n)$, unique up to homotopy. For $G$ a [[subgroup]] of $O(n)$, then a lift of this map through the canonical map $B G \longrightarrow B O(n)$ of classifying spaces is a _[[G-structure]]_ on $X$

$$
  \array{
    && B G
    \\
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& B O(n)
  }
$$ 

for instance an [[orientation]] for the inclusion $SO(n) \hookrightarrow O(n)$ of the [[special orthogonal group]], or an [[almost complex structure]] for the inclusion $U(n) \hookrightarrow O(2n)$ of the [[unitary group]].

All this generalizes, for instance from tangent bundles to [[normal bundles]] with respect to any [[embedding]]. It also behaves well with respect to passing to the [[boundary]] of manifolds, hence to [[bordism]]-classes of manifolds. This is what appears in [[Thom's theorem]] [below](#ThomTheorem).

For $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] and $K \subset H \subset G$ [[closed subspace|closed]] [[subgroups]], then the [[projection]] map on [[coset spaces]] 

$$
  p \;\colon\; G/K \longrightarrow G/H
$$

is a locally trivial $H/K$-[[fiber bundle]] (hence in particular a [[Serre fibration]]).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that the projection map in question is equivalently

$$
  G \times_H (H/K) \longrightarrow G/H
  \,,
$$

(where on the left we form the [[Cartesian product]] and then divide out the [[diagonal action]] by $H$). This exhibits it as the $H/K$-[[fiber bundle]] [[associated bundle|associated]] to the $H$-[[principal bundle]] of corollary \ref{QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal}.

###### Example

The [[n-spheres]] are [[coset]] spaces of [[orthogonal groups]]:

$$
  S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)
  \,.
$$

The odd-dimensional spheres are also coset spaces of [[unitary groups]]:

$$
  S^{2n+1}
  \simeq
  U(n+1)/U(n)
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

Fix a unit vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Then its [[orbit]] under the defining $O(n+1)$-[[action]] on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is clearly the canonical embedding $S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. But precisely the subgroup of $O(n+1)$ that consists of rotations around the axis formed by that unit vector [[stabilizer group|stabilizes]] it, and that subgroup is isomorphic to $O(n)$, hence $S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)$.

The second statement follows by the same kind of reasoning:

Clearly $U(n+1)$ [[transitive action|acts transitively]] on the unit sphere $S^{2n+1}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. It remains to see that its [[stabilizer subgroup]] of any point on this sphere is $U(n)$. If we take the point with [[coordinates]] $(1,0, 0, \cdots,0)$ and regard elements of $U(n+1)$ as [[matrices]], then the stabilizer subgroup consists of matrices of the block diagonal form

$$
  \left(
    \array{
      1 & \vec 0
      \\
      \vec 0 & A
    }
  \right)
$$

where $A \in U(n)$.

###### Proposition

For $n,k \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \leq k$, then the canonical inclusion of [[orthogonal groups]]

$$
  O(n) \hookrightarrow O(k)
$$

is an [[n-equivalence|(n-1)-equivalence]], hence induces an [[isomorphism]] on [[homotopy groups]] in degrees $\lt n-1$ and a [[surjection]] in degree $n-1$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the [[coset]] [[quotient]] [[projection]]

$$
  O(n)
    \longrightarrow
  O(n+1)
    \longrightarrow
  O(n+1)/O(n)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{OrthogonalGroupIsCompact} and by corollary \ref{QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal}, the projection $O(n+1)\to O(n+1)/O(n)$ is a [[Serre fibration]]. Furthermore, example \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace} identifies the [[coset]] with the [[n-sphere]] 

$$
  S^{n}\simeq O(n+1)/O(n)
  \,.
$$

Therefore the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] ([exmpl.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LongExactSequeceOfHomotopyGroups))of the [[fiber sequence]] $O(n)\to O(n+1)\to S^n$ has the form

$$
  \cdots
    \to

    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(O(n+1))
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(S^n)
   \to
  \cdots
$$

Since $\pi_{\lt n}(S^n) = 0$, this implies that 

$$
  \pi_{\lt n-1}(O(n))
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\lt n-1}(O(n+1))
$$

is an isomorphism and that

$$
  \pi_{n-1}(O(n))
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{n-1}(O(n+1))

is surjective. Hence now the statement follows by [[induction]] over $k-n$.

For $n,k \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \leq k$, then the canonical inclusion of [[unitary groups]]

$$
  U(n) \hookrightarrow U(k)

is a [[n-equivalence|2n-equivalence]], hence induces an [[isomorphism]] on [[homotopy groups]] in degrees $\lt 2n$ and a [[surjection]] in degree $2n$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the [[coset]] [[quotient]] [[projection]]

$$
  U(n)
  \longrightarrow
  U(n+1)
  \longrightarrow
  U(n+1)/U(n)
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{UnitaryGroupIsCompact} and corollary \ref{QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal}, the projection $U(n+1)\to U(n+1)/U(n)$ is a [[Serre fibration]]. Furthermore, example \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace} identifies the [[coset]] with the [[n-sphere|(2n+1)-sphere]] 

$$
  S^{2n+1}\simeq U(n+1)/U(n)
  \,.
$$

Therefore the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] ([exmpl.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LongExactSequeceOfHomotopyGroups))of the [[fiber sequence]] $U(n)\to U(n+1) \to S^{2n+1}$ is of the form

$$

    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(U(n+1))
    \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(S^{2n+1})
   \to
  \cdots
$$

Since $\pi_{\leq 2n}(S^{2n+1}) = 0$, this implies that 

$$
  \pi_{\lt 2n}(U(n))
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\lt 2n}(U(n+1))

is an isomorphism and that

$$
  \pi_{2n}(U(n))

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Take $\tilde B O(n) \coloneqq (E O(n+1))/O(n)$. 

To see that the canonical map $B O(n)\longrightarrow (E O(n+1))/O(n)$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] consider the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    O(n) &\overset{id}{\longrightarrow}& O(n)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    E O(n) &\longrightarrow& E O(n+1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B O(n) &\longrightarrow& (E O(n+1))/O(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{ProjectionOfCosetsIsFiberBundleForClosedSubgroupsOfCompactLieGroup} both bottom vertical maps are [[Serre fibrations]] and so both vertical sequences are [[fiber sequences]]. By prop. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOfBOnThoseOfOnShifted} part of the induced morphisms of [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] looks like this

$$
  \array{
    \pi_\bullet(B O(n))
    &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_\bullet( (E O(n+1))/O(n) )
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \pi_{\bullet-1}(O(n))
    &\overset{=}{\longrightarrow}&
    \pi_{\bullet-1}(O(n))
  }
  \,,
$$

where the vertical and the bottom morphism are isomorphisms. Hence also the to morphisms is an isomorphism.

That $B O(n)\to \tilde B O(n+1)$ is indeed a [[Serre fibration]] follows again with prop. \ref{ProjectionOfCosetsIsFiberBundleForClosedSubgroupsOfCompactLieGroup}, which gives the [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  O(n+1)/O(n)
    \longrightarrow
  (E O(n+1))/O(n)
    \longrightarrow
  (E O(n+1))/O(n+1)
  \,.
$$

The claim then follows with the identification

$$
  O(n+1)/O(n) \simeq S^n
$$

of example \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace}. 

The argument for the complex case is directly analogous, concluding instead with the identification 

$$
  U(n+1)/U(n)\simeq S^{2n+1}
$$

from example \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace}.

#### Thom spectra
 {#ThomSpectra}
 
**Idea**. Given a [[vector bundle]] $V$ of rank $n$ over a [[compact topological space]], then its [[one-point compactification]] is equivalently the result of forming the bundle $D(V) \hookrightarrow V$ of unit [[n-balls]], and identifying with one single point all the boundary unit [[n-spheres]] $S(V)\hookrightarrow V$. Generally, this construction $Th(C) \coloneqq D(V)/S(V)$ is called the _[[Thom space]]_ of $V$. 

Thom spaces occur notably as codomains for would-be [[left inverses]] of [[embeddings]] of [[manifolds]] $X \hookrightarrow Y$. The _[[Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map]]_ $Y \to Th(N X)$ of such an embedding is a continuous function going the other way around, but landing not quite in $X$ but in the [[Thom space]] of the [[normal bundle]] of $X$ in $Y$. Composing this further with the classifying map of the [[normal bundle]] lands in the Thom space of the [[universal vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B O(k)$, denoted $M O(k)$. In particular in the case that $Y = S^n$ is an [[n-sphere]] (and every manifold embeds into a large enough $n$-sphere, see also at [[Whitney embedding theorem]]), the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]] hence associates with every manifold an element of a [[homotopy group]] of a universal Thom space $M O(k)$.

This curious construction turns out to have excellent formal properties: as the dimension ranges, the universal Thom spaces arrange into a [[spectrum]], called the _[[Thom spectrum]]_, and the homotopy groups defined by the Pontryagin-Thom collapse pass along to the [[stable homotopy groups]] of this spectrum. 

Moreover, via [[Whitney sum]] of [[vector bundle]] the [[Thom spectrum]] naturally is a [[ring spectrum]], and under the Pontryagin-Thom collapse the [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds is compatible with this ring structure.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.5](#Kochman96), [Schwede 12, chapter I, example 1.16](#Schwede12))


#### Bordism and Thom's theorem
 {#ThomTheorem}

**Idea.** By the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse]] construction [above](#ThomSpectra), there is an assignment

$$
  n Manifolds \longrightarrow \pi_n(M O)
$$

which sends [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds to sum and product in the [[ring]] of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[Thom spectrum]]. One finds then that two manifolds map to the same element in $\pi_\bullet(M O)$ precisely if they are connected by a [[bordism]] as [above](#ClassifyingSpaces). The [[bordism]]-classes $\Omega_\bullet^O$ of manifolds  form a [[commutative ring]] under [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]], called the _[[bordism ring]]_, and hence Pontrjagin-Thom collapse produces a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \Omega_\bullet^O \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M O)
  \,.
$$

[[Thom's theorem]] states that this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]].

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.5](#Kochman96))


#### Thom isomorphism
 {#ThomIsomorphism}


**Idea.** If a [[vector bundle]] $E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} X$ of [[rank]] $n$ carries a cohomology class $\omega \in H^n(Th(E),R)$  that looks fiberwise like a [[volume form]] -- a [[Thom class]] -- then the operation of pulling back from base space and then forming the [[cup product]] with this [[Thom class]] is an [[isomorphism]] on (reduced) cohomology

$$
  ( (-) \cup \omega) \circ p^\ast 
  \;\colon\;
  H^\bullet(X,R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \tilde H^{\bullet+n}(Th(E),R)
  \,.
$$

This is the _[[Thom isomorphism]]_. It follow from the [[Serre spectral sequence]] (or else from the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]).

We need this below to compute (co)homology of universal Thom spectra $M U$ in terms of that of the [[classifying spaces]] $B U$.

Composed with pullback along the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]], the Thom isomorphism produces maps in cohomology that covariantly follow the underlying maps of spaces. These "[[Umkehr maps]]" have the interpretation of [[fiber integration]] against the Thom class.


**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 2.6](#Kochman96))



#### Orientation in generalized cohomology
 {#OrientationAndFiberIntegration}


**Idea.** From the way the [[Thom isomorphism]] via a [[Thom class]] works in [[ordinary cohomology]] (as [above](#ThomIsomorphism)), one sees what the general concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] and of [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] is to be.

Specifically we are interested in [[complex oriented cohomology]] theories $E$, characterized by an orientation class on infinity [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ (def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}), the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]], which restricts to a generator on $S^2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^\infty$.

(Another important application is given by taking $E = $ [[KU]] to be [[topological K-theory]]. Then [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] is [[spin^c structure]] and fiber integration with coefficients in $E$ is [[fiber integration in K-theory]]. This is classical _[[index theory]]_.)

##### Complex projective space

Complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ the the [[projective space]] $\mathbb{A}P^n$ for $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{C}$ the [[complex numbers]] (and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$), a [[complex manifold]] of complex [[dimension]] $n$ (real dimension $2n$). Equivalently, this is the complex [[Grassmannian]] $Gr_1(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})$ (def. \ref{RealAndComplexGrassmannian}). For the special case $n = 1$ then $\mathbb{C}P^1 \simeq S^2$ is the [[Riemann sphere]].

As $n$ ranges, there are natural inclusions

$$
  \ast = \mathbb{C}P^0 
    \hookrightarrow 
  \mathbb{C}P^1 
    \hookrightarrow 
  \mathbb{C}P^2
    \hookrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}P^3
    \hookrightarrow
  \cdots

The [[sequential colimit]] over this sequence is the infinite complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$. This is a model for the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ of [[circle principal bundles]]/[[complex line bundles]] (an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$).

###### Proof

To see the second characterization from def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}:

With ${\vert -\vert} \colon \mathbb{C}^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ the standard [[norm]], then every element $\vec z \in \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is identified under the defining equivalence relation with 

$$
  \frac{1}{\vert \vec z\vert}\vec z \in S^{2n-1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n+1}
$$

lying on the unit $(2n-1)$-sphere. This fixes the action of $\mathbb{C}-0$ up to a remaining action of complex numbers of unit [[absolute value]]. These form the [[circle group]] $S^1$.

The first characterization follows via prop. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsGrassmannian} from the general discusion at _[[Grassmannian]]_. With this the second characterization follows also with the [[coset]] identification of the $(2n+1)$-sphere: $S^{2n+1} \simeq U(n+1)/U(n)$ ([exmpl.](unitary+group#nSphereAsUnitaryCosetSpace)).

###### Proof

Given homogenous coordinates $(z_0, z_1, \cdots, z_n, z_{n+1}, z_{n+2}) \in \mathbb{C}^{n+2}$ for $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$, let 

$$
  \phi \coloneqq -arg(z_{n+2})
$$ 

be the [[phase]] of $z_{n+2}$. Then under the equivalence relation defining $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ these coordinates represent the same element as

$$
  \frac{1}{\vert \vec z\vert}(e^{i \phi} z_0, e^{i \phi}z_1,\cdots, e^{i \phi}z_{n+1}, r)
  \,,
$$ 

where 

$$
  r = {\vert z_{n+2}\vert}\in [0,1) \subset \mathbb{C}
$$ 

is the [[absolute value]] of $z_{n+2}$. Representatives $\vec z'$ of this form (${\vert \vec z' \vert = 1}$ and $z'_{n+2} \in [0,1]$) parameterize the [[n-disk|2n+2-disk]] $D^{2n+2}$ ($2n+3$ real parameters subject to the one condition that the sum of their norm squares is unity) with [[boundary]] the $(2n+1)$-sphere at $r = 0$. The only remaining part of the action of $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$ which fixes the form of these representatives is $S^1$ acting on the elements with $r = 0$ by phase shifts on the $z_0, \cdots, z_{n+1}$. The quotient of this remaining action on $D^{2(n+1)}$ identifies its boundary $S^{2n+1}$-sphere with $\mathbb{C}P^{n}$, by prop. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsS1Quotient}.

###### Proposition

For $A \in $ [[Ab]] any [[abelian group]], then the [[ordinary homology]] [[homology groups|groups]] of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ are

$$
  H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n,A)\simeq
  \left\{

$$

       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.

$$

Moreover, if $A$ carries the structure of a [[ring]] $R = (A, \cdot)$, then under the [[cup product]] the [[cohomology ring]] of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the the [[graded ring]]

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
   \simeq
  R[c_1] / (c_1^{n+1})
$$

which is the [[quotient]] of the [[polynomial ring]] on a single generator $c_1$ in degree 2, by the relation that identifies [[cup products]] of more than $n$-copies of the generator $c_1$ with zero.

Finally, the [[cohomology ring]] of the infinite-dimensional complex projective space is the [[formal power series ring]] in one generator:

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty, R)
   \simeq
  R[ [ c_1 ] ]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the case that the coefficients are the [[integers]] $A = \mathbb{Z}$. 

Since $\mathbb{C}P^n$ admits the structure of a [[CW-complex]] by prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}, we may compute its [[ordinary homology]] equivalently as its [[cellular homology]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CelluarEquivalentToSingularFromSpectralSequence)). By definition ([defn.](cellular+homology#CellularChainComplex)) this is the [[chain homology]] of the chain complex of [[relative homology]] groups

$$
  \cdots
    \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}   
  H_{q+2}((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q+2}, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q+1})
   \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}   
  H_{q+1}((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q+1}, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q})
   \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}
  H_{q}((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q}, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q-1})
    \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}   
  \cdots  
  \,,
$$

where $(-)_q$ denotes the $q$th stage of the [[CW-complex]]-structure. Using the CW-complex structure provided by prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}, then there are cells only in every second degree, so that 

$$
  (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k+1} = (\mathbb{C}P)_{2k}
$$

for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. It follows that the cellular chain complex has a zero group in every second degree, so that all differentials vanish. Finally, since prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace} says that $(\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k+2}$ arises from $(\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k+1} = (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k}$ by attaching a single $2k+2$-cell it follows that (by passage to [[reduced homology]])

$$
  H_{2k}(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z})
    \simeq
  \tilde H_{2k}(S^{2k})((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k}/(\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k-1})
   \simeq
  \tilde H_{2k}(S^{2k})
    \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

This establishes the claim for ordinary homology with integer coefficients.

In particular this means that $H_q(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z})$ is a [[free abelian group]] for all $q$. Since free abelian groups are the [[projective objects]] in [[Ab]] ([prop.](projective+object#ProjectiveObjectsInAbAreFreeGroups)) it follows (with the discussion at _[[derived functors in homological algebra]]_) that the [[Ext]]-groups vanishe:

$$
  Ext^1(H_q(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z}),A) = 0
$$

and the [[Tor]]-groups vanishes:

$$
 Tor_1(H_q(\mathbb{C}P^n), A) = 0
  \,.
$$

With this, the statement about homology and cohomology groups with general coefficients follows with the [[universal coefficient theorem]] for ordinary homology ([thm.](universal+coefficient+theorem#TheoremInOrdinaryHomology)) and for ordinary cohomology ([thm.](universal+coefficient+theorem#OrdinaryStatementInCohomology)).

Finally to see the action of the [[cup product]]: by definition this is the composite

$$
  \cup
  \;\colon\;
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
  \otimes
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
    \longrightarrow
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n \times \mathbb{C}P^n , R)
    \overset{\Delta^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n,R)
$$

of the "cross-product" map that appears in the [[Kunneth theorem]], and the pullback along the [[diagonal]] $\Delta\colon \mathbb{C}P^n \to \mathbb{C}P^n \times \mathbb{C}P^n$.

Since, by the above, the groups $H^2k(\mathbb{C}P^n,R) \simeq R[2k]$ and $H^{2k+1}(\mathbb{C}P^n,R) = 0$ are free and finitely generated, the [[Kunneth theorem]] in ordinary cohomology applies ([prop.](Künneth+theorem#KunnethInOrdinaryCohomology)) and says that the cross-product map above is an isomorphism. This shows that under cup product pairs of generators are sent to a generator, and so the statement $H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n , R)\simeq R[c_1](c_1^{n+1})$ follows.

This also implies that the projection maps

$$
  H^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n+2}, R)
  = 
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}, R) 
  \to 
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+}, R) 
  =
  H^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n}, R)
$$

are all [[epimorphisms]]. Therefore this sequence satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]] (def. \ref{MittagLefflerCondition}, example \ref{MittagLefflerSatisfiedInParticularForTowerOfSurjections}) and therefore the [[Milnor exact sequence]] for cohomology (prop. \ref{MilorSequenceForReducedCohomologyOnCWComplex}) implies the last claim to be proven:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty, R)
    \\
    & 
     \simeq 
    H^\bullet( \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \mathbb{C}P^n , R)
   \\
    &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
   \\
   &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n ( R [c_1^E] / ((c_1)^{n+1})  )
   \\

###### Definition

A [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] $E$ (def. \ref{MultiplicativeCohomologyTheory}) is called **complex orientable** if the the following equivalent conditions hold

1. The morphism

   $$
     i^\ast \;\colon\; E^2(B U(1)) \longrightarrow E^2(S^2)
   $$

   is [[surjection|surjective]].

1. The morphism

   $$
     \tilde i^\ast \;\colon\; \tilde E^2(B U(1)) \longrightarrow \tilde E^2(S^2)
     \simeq \pi_0(E)
   $$

   is [[surjection|surjective]].

1. The element $1 \in \pi_0(E)$ is in the [[image]] of the morphism $\tilde i^\ast$.

A **complex orientation** on a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] $E^\bullet$ is an element 

$$
  c_1^E \in \tilde E^2(B U(1))
$$

(the "first [[generalized Chern class]]") such that 

$$
  i^\ast c^E_1 = 1 \in \pi_0(E)
  \,.

###### Remark

Since $B U(1) \simeq K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ is the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]], it follows that a complex orientation on $E^\bullet$ induces an $E$-[[generalized Chern class|generalization]] of the [[first Chern class]] which to a [[complex line bundle]] $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$ classified by $\phi \colon X \to B U(1)$ assigns the class $c_1(\mathcal{L}) \coloneqq \phi^\ast c_1^E$. This construction extends to a general construction of $E$-[[Chern classes]].

###### Proposition

Given a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $(E^\bullet, c^E_1)$ (def. \ref{ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheories}), then there is an [[isomorphism]] of [[graded rings]] 

$$
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty) \simeq E^\bullet(\ast)[ [ c_1^E ] ]
$$

between the $E$-[[cohomology ring]] of infinite-dimensional complex projective space (def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}) and the [[formal power series]] in one generator of even degree over the $E$-[[cohomology ring]] of the point.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using the [[CW-complex]]-structure on $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ from prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}, given by inductively identifying $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ with the result of attaching a single $2n$-cell to $\mathbb{C}P^n$. With this structure, the unique 2-cell inclusion $i \;\colon\; S^2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is identified with the canonical map $S^2 \to B U(1)$.

Then consider the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] (prop. \ref{AHSSExistence}) for the $E$-cohomology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$. 

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, E^\bullet(\ast))
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
  \,.
$$

Since, by prop. \ref{OrdinaryCohomologyOfComplexProjectiveSpace}, the [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]] of complex projective space is 

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[c_1]
  \,,
$$

where $c_1$ represents a unit in $H^2(S^2, \mathbb{Z})\simeq \mathbb{Z}$, and since similarly the [[ordinary homology]] of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is a [[free abelian group]], hence a [[projective object]] in abelian groups ([prop.](projective+object#ProjectiveObjectsInAbAreFreeGroups)), the [[Ext]]-group vanishes in each degree ($Ext^1(H_n(\mathbb{C}P^n), E^\bullet(\ast)) = 0$) and so the [[universal coefficient theorem]] ([prop.](universal+coefficient+theorem#OrdinaryStatementInCohomology)) gives that the second page of the spectral sequence is

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, E^\bullet(\ast))
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(\ast)[ c_1 ] / (c_1^{n+1})
  \,.
$$

By the standard construction of the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] ([here](Atiyah–Hirzebruch+spectral+sequence#ConstructionByFilteringTheBaseSpace)) in this identification the element $c_1$ is identified with a generator of the [[relative cohomology]]

$$
  E^2((\mathbb{C}P^n)_2, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_1)
  \simeq
  \tilde E^2(S^2)
$$

(using, by the above, that this $S^2$ is the unique 2-cell of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ in the standard cell model).

This means that $c_1$ is a permanent cocycle of the spectral sequence (in the kernel of all differentials) precisely if it arises via restriction from an element in $E^2(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ and hence precisely if there exists a complex orientation $c_1^E$ on $E$. Since this is the case by assumption on $E$, $c_1$ is a permanent cocycle.

The same argument applied to all elements in $E^\bullet(\ast)[c]$, or else the $E^\bullet(\ast)$-linearity of the differentials (prop. \ref{LinearityOfDifferentialsInSerreAHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyTheory}), implies that all these elements are permanent cocycles.

Since the AHSS of a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] is a [[multiplicative spectral sequence]] ([prop.](multiplicative+cohomology+theory#AHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyTheoryIsMultiplicative)) this implies that the differentials in fact vanish on all elements of $E^\bullet(\ast) [c_1] / (c_1^{n+1})$, hence that the given AHSS collapses on the second page to give

$$
  \mathcal{E}_\infty^{\bullet,\bullet}
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(\ast)[ c_1^{E} ] / ((c_1^E)^{n+1})
$$

or in more detail:

$$
  \mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
      E^\bullet(\ast) & \text{if}\; p \leq  2n \; and\; even
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, since therefore all $\mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}$ are [[free modules]] over $E^\bullet(\ast)$, and since the filter stage inclusions $F^{p+1} E^\bullet(X) \hookrightarrow F^{p}E^\bullet(X)$ are $E^\bullet(\ast)$-[[module]] homomorphisms ([prop.](multiplicative+cohomology+theory#RingAndModuleStructureOnCohomologyGroupsOfMultiplicativeCohomplogyTheory)) the extension problem (remark \ref{ExtensionProblemForSpectralSequences}) trivializes, in that all the [[short exact sequences]]

$$
  0 \to F^{p+1}E^{p+\bullet}(X) \longrightarrow F^{p}E^{p+\bullet}(X) \longrightarrow \mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet} \to 0
$$

[[split exact sequence|split]] (since the [[Ext]]-group $Ext^1_{E^\bullet(\ast)}(\mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet},-) = 0$ vanishes on the [[free module]], hence [[projective module]] $\mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}$).

In conclusion, this gives an isomorphism of graded rings

$$
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
  \simeq
  \underset{p}{\oplus} \mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(\ast)[ c_1 ] / ((c_1^{E})^{n+1})
  \,.
$$

A first consequence is that the projection maps

$$
  E^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n+2})
  = 
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}) 
  \to 
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+}) 
  =
  E^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n})
$$

are all [[epimorphisms]]. Therefore this sequence satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]] ([def.](lim1#MittagLefflerCondition), [exmpl.](lim1#MittagLefflerSatisfiedInParticularForTowerOfSurjections)) and therefore the [[Milnor exact sequence]] for generalized cohomology ([prop.](lim1#MilorSequenceForReducedCohomologyOnCWComplex)) finally implies the claim:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^\bullet(B U(1))
     & \simeq
    E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)
    \\
    & \simeq 
    E^\bullet( \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \mathbb{C}P^n )
   \\
    &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
   \\
   &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n ( E^\bullet(\ast) [c_1^E] / ((c_1^E)^{n+1})  )
   \\
   & \simeq E^\bullet(\ast)[ [ c_1^E ] ]
   \,,
  \end{aligned}

### **S.3)** Complex oriented cohomology
 {#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory}


**Idea.** Given the concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] as [above](#OrientationAndFiberIntegration), it is clearly of interest to consider [[cohomology theories]] $E$ such that there exists an [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]/[[Thom class]] on the [[universal vector bundle]] over any [[classifying space]] $B G$ (or rather: on its induced [[spherical fibration]]), because then _all_ $G$-[[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundles]] inherit an orientation.

Considering this for $G = U(n)$ the [[unitary groups]] yields the concept of _[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]_. 

It turns out that a complex orientation on a generalized cohomology theory $E$ in this sense is already given by demanding that there is a suitable generalization of the [[first Chern class]] of [[complex line bundles]] in $E$-cohomology. By the [[splitting principle]], this already implies the existence of [[generalized Chern classes]] ([[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]) of all degrees, and these are the required universal generalized [[Thom classes]].

Where the ordinary [[first Chern class]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] is simply additive under [[tensor product]] of [[complex line bundles]], one finds that the composite of generalized first Chern classes is instead governed by more general commutative [[formal group laws]]. This phenomenon governs much of the theory to follow.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1-10](#Lurie10), [Adams 74, Part I, Part II](#Adams74)).




#### Chern classes
 {#ChernClasses}

**Idea**. In particular [[ordinary cohomology]] [[HR]] is canonically a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. The behaviour of general [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] to be discussed [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses) follows closely the behaviour of the ordinary [[Chern classes]]. 

An ordinary [[Chern class]] is a [[characteristic class]] of [[complex vector bundles]], and since there is the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of complex vector bundles, the _universal_ Chern classes are those of the [[universal complex vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B U$, which in turn are just the [[ordinary cohomology]] classes in $H^\bullet(B U)$

These may be computed inductively by iteratively applying to the [[spherical fibrations]]

$$
  S^{2n-1} \longrightarrow B U(n-1) \longrightarrow B U(n)
$$

the [[Thom-Gysin exact sequence]], a special case of the [[Serre spectral sequence]]. 

Pullback of Chern classes along the canonical map $(B U(1))^n \longrightarrow B U(n)$ identifies them with the [[symmetric polynomials]] in the [[first Chern class]] in $H^2(B U(1))$. This is the _[[splitting principle]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 2.2 and 2.3](#Kochman96), [Switzer 75, section 15.3](#Switzer75) [Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

$\,$

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let

$$
  \array{
    S^n &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

be a [[fiber bundle]] of [[n-spheres]] over a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[simplicial complex]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There exists a [[Thom class]]  $c \in H^{n+1}(E; R)$ (in the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the total space with [[coefficients]] in $R$) such that the [[cup product]] operation $c \cup (-)$ sits in a [[long exact sequence]] of [[cohomology groups]] of the form

$$
  \cdots 
   \to 
   H^k(B; R) 
     \stackrel{\pi^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
   H^k(E; R)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k-n}(B;R)
   \stackrel{c \cup (-)}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k+1}(B; R)
   \to
   \cdots
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Switzer 75, section 15.30](#Switzer75), [Kochman 96, corollary 2.2.6](#Kochman96))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

There is the corresponding [[Serre spectral sequence]] 

$$
  E_2^{s,t}
  =
  H^s(B; H^t(S^n;R))
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  H^{s+t}(E; R)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[n-sphere]] [[fiber]] is concentrated in just two degees

$$
  H^t(S^n; R)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      R & for \; t= 0 \; and \; t = n
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

most terms on the $E_2$ page of this spectral sequence, and hence on all the further pages, vanish. As a consequence, the only possible non-vanishing differentials $d_r$ are those on the $(n+1)$-page, of the form

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1,0} & \simeq &  H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Now since the [[coefficients]] $R$ is a [[ring]], then by prop. \ref{AHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyIsMultiplicative} the [[Serre spectral sequence]] is [[multiplicative spectral sequence|multiplicative]] under [[cup product]] and the [[differential]] is a [[derivation]] (of total degree 1) with respect to this product.

To make use of this, write

$$
  \iota = 1 \in H^0(B;R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E_{n+1}^{0,n} 
$$

for the unit in the cup product ring $H^\bullet(X;R)$, regarded as an element in the $(n+1)$-page of the spectral sequence. Notice that as such $\iota$ is not in degree 0, but in bidegree $(0,n)$, in particular $\iota$ is _not_ in $E_{n+1}^{0,0}$ and in particular is not the unit in there, and hence $d_{n+1}(\iota)$ need not vanish. Write

$$
  c \coloneqq d_{n+1}(\iota) \in E_{n+1}^{n+1,0} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H^{n+1}(B; R)
$$

for this element. This is the Thom class in question.

Because, notice that every element in $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,n}$ is of the form $\iota \cdot b$ for $b\in E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0} \simeq H^\bullet(B;R)$, and since $d_{n+1}$ is a [[derivation]] and vanishes on $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0}$, it follows that its action is fixed by 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{n+1}(\iota \cdot b)
    & =
    d_{n+1}(\iota) \cdot b + (-1)^{n} \iota \cdot \underset{= 0}{\underbrace{d_{n+1}(b)}}
    \\
    & = c \cdot b
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This shows that 

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence the non-vanishing entries of the $E_\infty$-page of the spectral sequence sit in [[exact sequences]] like so

$$
  \array{
     0
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s,n}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{ker(d_{n+1})}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{coker}(d_{n+1})}\downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s+n+1,0}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     0
  }  
  \,.
$$

Finally observe (lemma \ref{lemma}) that due to the sparseness of the $E_\infty$-page, there are also [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s,0} \longrightarrow H^s(E; R) \longrightarrow  E_\infty^{s-n,n} \to 0
  \,.
$$

Concatenating these with the above exact sequences yields the desired [[long exact sequence]].

+-- {: .num_lemma #lemma}
###### Lemma

For a cohomology [[spectral sequence]] converging to some $C^\bullet$ with the property that $E_\infty^{s,t} = 0$ unless $t = 0$ or $t = n$, then there are [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s,0} \longrightarrow C^s \longrightarrow  E_\infty^{s-n,n} \to 0
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Switzer 75, p. 356](#Switzer75))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of convergence the $E_{\infty}^{s,t}$ sit in [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to F^{s+1}C^{s+t} \longrightarrow F^s C^{s+t} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,t} \to 0
  \,.
$$

So when $E_\infty^{s,t} = 0$ the left morphism here is an [[isomorphism]].

We may use this to either shift away the filtering degree

* if $t \geq n$ then $F^s C^{s+t} = F^{s}C^{s-1+t+1} \simeq F^0 C^{s-1+t+1} = F^0 C^{s+t} \simeq C^{s+t}$.

or to shift away the offset of the filtering to the total degree:

* if $0 \leq t-1 \leq n-1$ then $F^{s+1}C^{s+t} = F^{s+1}C^{s+1+t-1} = F^{s+t}C^{s+1+t-1} = F^{s+t}C^{s+t}$

* if $t \lt 0$ then $F^{s}C^{s+t} = 0$.

In particular $F^{s}C^{s} \simeq E_\infty^{s,0}$.

Hence the defining exact sequence

$$
  0 \to F^{s+1}C^{s+n} \longrightarrow F^{s}C^{s+n} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,n} \to 0
$$

becomes

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s+n,0} \longrightarrow C^{s+n} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,n}
 \to 0
  \,.
$$

#### Conner-Floyd Chern classes
 {#ConnerFloydChernClasses}

**Idea.** For $E$ a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], then the generators of the $E$-[[cohomology groups]] of the [[classifying space]] $B U$ are called the _[[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]_, in $E^\bullet(B U)$. 

Using basic properties of the classifying space $B U(1)$ via its incarnation as the infinite [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, one finds that the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]]

$$
  H^p(\mathbb{C}P^n, \pi_q(E)) \Rightarrow H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
$$

collapse right away, and that the [[inverse system]] which they form satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]]. Accordinly the [[Milnor exact sequence]] gives that the ordinary [[first Chern class]] $c_1$ generates,  over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, all Conner-Floyd classes over $B U(1)$:

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E) [ [ c_1 ] ]
  \,.
$$

This is the key input for the discussion of [[formal group laws]] [below](#FormalGroupLaws).

Combining the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] with the [[splitting principle]] as for ordinary Chern classes [above](#ChernClasses) yields, similarly, that in general Conner-Floyd classes are generated, over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, from the ordinary Chern classes.

Finally one checks that Conner-Floyd classes canonically serve as [[Thom classes]] for $E$-cohomology of the [[universal complex vector bundle]], therby showing that [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] are indeed canonically [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] on ([[spherical fibrations]] of) [[complex vector bundles]]. 
 
**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96) [Adams 74, part I.4, part II.2 II.4, part III.10](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))


#### Formal group laws of first CF-Chern classes
 {#FormalGroupLaws}

**Idea.** The [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ for [[complex line bundles]] is a [[homotopy type]] canonically equipped with commutative group structure ([[infinity-group]]-structure), corresponding to the [[tensor product]] of complex line bundles. By the above, the [[first Chern class]] of these complex line bundles generates the $E$-cohomology of $B U(1)$, it follows that the [[cohomology ring]] $E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c_1 ] ]$ behaves like the ring of $\pi_\bullet(E)$-valued functions on a 1-dimensional commutative [[formal group]] equipped with a canonical [[coordinate]] function $c_1$. This is called a _[[formal group law]]_ over the [[graded ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$. 

On abstract grounds it follows that there exists a commutative ring $L$ and a universal (1-dimensional commutative) formal group law $\ell$ over $L$. This is called the _[[Lazard ring]]_. [[Lazard's theorem]] identifies this ring concretely: it turns out to simply be the [[polynomial ring]] on generators in every even degree.

Further below this has profound implications on the structure theory for complex oriented cohomology. The [[Milnor-Quillen theorem on MU]] identifies the Lazard ring as the cohomology ring of the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]], and then the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]], implies that there are lots of complex oriented cohomology theories.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1 and 2](#Lurie10))


#### Complex cobordism
 {#ComplexCobordismCohomology}

**Idea.** There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $\phi \colon B U(1)\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} M U(1)$ between the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]] and the  [[Thom space]] of the [[universal vector bundle|universal complex line bundle]]. This gives an element $\pi_\ast(c_1) \in M U^2(B U(1))$ in the [[complex cobordism cohomology]] of $B U(1)$ which makes the universal complex [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]] become a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].

This turns out to be a [[universal complex orientation on MU]]: for every other [[ring spectrum]] $E$ there is an equivalence between complex orientations on $E$ and ring spectrum homomorphisms

$$
  \{M U \longrightarrow E\} \;\simeq\; \{complex\;orientations\;on\;E\}
  \,.
$$

Hence [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is just [[higher algebra]] over [[MU]]. Equivalently: affine [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(MU)$.

#### Homology of $M U$
 {#HomologyOfMU}

**Idea.** Since, by the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ is indeed [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] over [[complex vector bundles]], there is a [[Thom isomorphism]] which reduces the computation of the $E$-[[homology of MU]], $E_\bullet(M U)$ to that of the [[classifying space]] $B U$. The homology of $B U$, in turn, may be determined by the duality with its cohomology ([[universal coefficient theorem]]) via [[Kronecker pairing]] and the induced duality of the corresponding [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]] (prop. \ref{AHSSPairing}) from the Conner-Floyed classes [above](#ConnerFloydChernClasses). Finally, via the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]/[[Boardman homomorphism]] the homology of $M U$ gives a first approximation to the [[homotopy groups]] of [[MU]].

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 2.4, 4.3](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lecture 7](#Lurie10))


#### Milnor-Quillen theorem on $M U$
 {#QuillenTheoremOnMU}

**Idea.** From the computation of the [[homology of MU]] [above](#HomologyOfMU) and applying the [[Boardman homomorphism]], one deduces that the [[stable homotopy groups]] $\pi_\bullet(MU)$ of [[MU]] are finitely generated. This implies that it is suffient to compute them over the [[p-adic integers]] for all primes $p$. Using the [[change of rings theorem]], this finally is obtained from inspection of the filtration in the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] for $MU$. This is Milnor's theorem wich together with [[Lazard's theorem]] shows that there is an isomorphism of rings $L \simeq \pi_\bullet(M U)$ with the [[Lazard ring]]. Finally [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] says that this isomorphism is exhibited by the universal ring homomorphism $L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M U)$ which classifies the universal complex orientation on $M U$.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie, lecture 10](#Lurie10))


#### Landweber exact functor theorem

**Idea.** By the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] induces a [[formal group law]] from its first [[Conner-Floyd Chern class]]. Moreover, [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] together with [[Lazard's theorem]] say that the [[cohomology ring]] $\pi_\bullet(M U)$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology]] [[MU]] is the classifying ring for formal group laws. 

The _[[Landweber exact functor theorem]]_ says that, conversely, forming the [[tensor product]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([[MU]]) with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact]] [[ring]] via some [[formal group law]] yields a [[cohomology theory]], hence a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. 

**Literature.** ([Lurie 10, lectures 15,16](#Lurie10))

### Outlook: Geometry of $Spec(MU)$

The grand conclusion of [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] ([above](#QuillenTheoremOnMU)): [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is essentially the [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(M U)$, and the latter is a kind of derived version of the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] (1-dimensional commutative).
