Given a commutative unital ring $k$ and a field $L\supset k$, an element $x\in L$ is said to be __integral__ over $k$ if it satisfies a [[monic polynomial]] equation with coefficients in $k$, or equivalently, there exist a finitely-generated nonzero $k$-submodule $M\subset L$ such that $x M \subset M$. 

A ring $K\supset k$ is said to be __integral__ over $k$ if every element of $K$ is integral over $k$. The relation of integrality of overrings is transitive. If $f:K\to K'$ is a surjective homomorphism of rings and $K$ integral over $k\subset K$, then $K' = f(K)$ is integral over $f(k)$.

The set of all elements of $L$ integral over $k$ is a subring of $L$ called the __integral closure__ of $k$ in $L$. We say that $k$ is __integrally closed in__ $L$ if it equals its own integral closure in $L$.

A commutative [[integral domain]] $k$ is __integrally closed__ if it is integrally closed in the quotient field of $k$. 

If $k$ is an integrally closed [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian domain]] and $L$ a finite separable field extension of its quotient field $Q(k)$ then the integral closure of $k$ in $L$ is finitely generated over $k$. 

If $k$ is a principal ideal ring and $L$ a finite separable extension of degree $n$ of its quotient field $Q(k)$, then the integral closure of $k$ in $L$ is a free rank $n$-module over $k$. 

If $K$ is integral over a subring $k$ then for any multiplicative set $S\subset k$, the localization $S^{-1} K$ is integral over $S^{-1} k$.  

Every [[unique factorization domain]] is integrally closed.
