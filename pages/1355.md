#Idea#

The _Verity-Gray tensor product_ or _lax Gray tensor product of [[stratified simplicial set]]s_ is a [[tensor product]] on the [[category]] $Strat$ of [[stratified simplicial set]]s which when restricted to [[complicial set]]s, i.e. [[oriental|omega-nerve]]s of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] reproduces the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]] on strict $\omega$-categories.

#Definition#

Let $(X, t X)$ and $(Y, t Y)$ be [[stratified simplicial set]]s. Then their **Verity-Gray tensor product** $(X, t X) \otimes (Y, t Y)$ is given by

$$
  (X, t X) \otimes (Y, t Y)
  :=
  (X \times Y, q(t X, t Y))
  \,,
$$

where $X \times Y$ is the [[cartesian product]] of [[simplicial set]]s (hence the standard monoidal structure on [[SSet]]), while $q(t X, t Y)$, the set of thin cells, is $tX\times tY$ for the Gray product, and for the lax-Gray product it is enlarged as described in the paper.
