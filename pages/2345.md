A __$2$-functor__ is simply a [[functor]] between $2$-[[2-category|categories]].

Of course, anything that goes between $2$-categories, if it deserves to be called anything like 'functor' at all, will be a $2$-functor, so the prefix is not really necessary.  (For discussion of this issue in general, see [[higher functor]].)  On the other hand, sometimes the more precise terminology helps to clarify that one really is thinking of $2$-categories, as with a pseudo functor (a weak $2$-functor, see below) to [[Cat]].

In any case, one does need to take care to write the definition correctly.  There are actually (at least) two ways to do this, corresponding to the two kinds of $2$-categories: [[strict 2-category|strict]] and [[bicategory|weak]].  So for the definitions, see:
*  [[strict 2-functor]]
*  [[pseudo functor]]

Compare [[lax 2-functor]], which should *not* be called simply 'functor'.

It doesn\'t make sense to speak of strict $2$-functors between weak $2$-categories, but it does make sense to speak of weak $2$-functors between strict $2$-categories.  Indeed, the weak $3$-[[3-category|categories]] $(Str 2 Cat, \Psi Fun)$ and [[Bicat]] (of strict $2$-categories and pseudo functors, and of bicategories and pseudofunctors, in both cases with [[natural transformation|transformations]] and [[modifications]]) are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], but the $3$-category [[Str2Cat]] (of strict $2$-categories, strict $2$-functors, transformations, and modifications) is essentially different.  (For the generalisation of this to higher categories, see [[semistrict higher category]].)
