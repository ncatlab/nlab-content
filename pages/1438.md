An __initial algebra__ for an [[endofunctor]] $F$ on a category $C$ is an [[initial object]] in the category of [[algebra|algebras]] of $F$.

If $F$ has an initial algebra $\alpha: F(X) \to X$, then $X$ is isomorphic to $F(X)$ via $\alpha$; this is **Lambek's theorem**.  In this sense, $X$ is a fixed point of $F$.  Being initial, $X$ is the *smallest* fixed point of $F$ in that there is a map from $X$ to any other fixed point (indeed, any other algebra), and this map is an [[injection]] if $C$ is [[Set]]. 

The dual concept is [[terminal coalgebra]], which is the *largest* fixed point of $F$.


##Proof of Lambek's theorem##  

+-- {: .proof}
Given an initial algebra structure $\alpha: F(X) \to X$, define an algebra structure on $F(X)$ to be $F(\alpha): F(F(X)) \to F(X)$. By initiality, there exists an $F$-algebra map $i: X \to F(X)$, so that 

$$\array{
F(X) & \overset{F(i)}{\to} & F(F(X)) \\
\alpha \downarrow & & \downarrow F(\alpha) \\
X & \underset{i}{\to} & F(X)
}$$ 

commutes. Now it is trivial, in fact tautological that $\alpha$ is itself an $F$-algebra map $F(X) \to X$. Thus $\alpha \circ i = 1_X$, since both sides of the equation are $F$-algebra maps $X \to X$ and $X$ is initial. As a result, $F(\alpha) \circ F(i) = 1_{F(X)}$, so that $i \circ \alpha = 1_{F(X)}$ according to the commutative square. Hence $\alpha$ is an isomorphism, with inverse $i$.

##Examples## 

In many cases, initial algebras can be constructed in [[recursion|recursive]] fashion, using the following special case of a theorem due to Ad&aacute;mek.

######Theorem (Ad&aacute;mek) 
Let $C$ be a category with an [[initial object]] $0$ and [[colimits]] of chains $\omega \to C$ (where $\omega$ is the first infinite [[ordinal]]), and suppose $F: C \to C$ preserves colimits of $\omega$-chains. Then the colimit $\gamma$ of the chain 

$$0 \overset{i}{\to} F(0) \overset{F(i)}{\to} \ldots \to F^{(n)}(0) \overset{F^{(n)}(i)}{\to} F^{(n+1)}(0) \to \ldots$$ 

carries a structure of initial $F$-algebra. 
=-- 

The $F$-algebra structure $F\gamma \to \gamma$ is inverse to the canonical map $\gamma \to F\gamma$ out of the colimit (which is invertible by the hypothesis on $F$). The proof of initiality may be extracted by dualizing the corresponding proof given at [[terminal coalgebra]]. 

This theorem applies in particular to any functor $F: Set \to Set$ which is a colimit of finitely representable functors $hom(n, -): X \mapsto X^n$, as in the following examples. 
 
* Let $A$ be a set, and let $F: Set \to Set$ be the functor $F(X) = 1 + A \times X$. Then the initial $F$-algebra is $A^*$, the [[free monoid]] on $A$. The $F$-algebra structure is 
  $$(e, m| ): 1 + A \times A^* \to A^*$$ 
  where $e: 1 \to A^*$ is the identity and $m|: A \times A^* \to A^*$ is the restriction of the monoid multiplication along the evident inclusion $i \times 1: A \times A^* \to A^* \times A^*$. 

  This "fixed point" of $F$ can be thought of as the result of the (slightly nonsensical) calculation 
  $$1 + A \times X = X \Rightarrow X = \frac1{1 - A} = 1 + A + A^2 + \ldots = A^*$$ 
  which can be made rigorous by interpreting the initial equality as defining the solution $X$ by recursion, and applying the theorem above. 

* Let $F: Set \to Set$ be the functor $F(X) = 1 + X^2$. Then the initial $F$-algebra is the set $T$ of isomorphism classes of finite (planar, rooted) binary [[trees]]. The $F$-algebra structure is 
  $$(r, j): 1 + T^2 \to T$$ 
  where $r: 1 \to T$ names the tree consisting of just a root vertex, and $j: T^2 \to T$ creates a tree $t \vee t'$ from two trees $t$, $t'$ by joining their roots to a new root, so that the root of $t$ becomes the left child and the root of $t'$ the right child of the new root. 

  The recursive equation 
  $$T = 1 + T^2$$ 
  would seem to imply that the structure $T$ behaves something like a structural "sixth root of unity", and indeed the structural isomorphism $T \cong F(T)$ allows one to exhibit an isomorphism 
  $$T = T^7$$ 
  constructively, as famously explored in the paper by Andreas Blass, _Seven Trees in One_. 

* Let $F: Set \to Set$ be the functor $F(X) = X^*$ (the free monoid from an earlier example). Then the initial $F$-algebra is the set of isomorphism classes of finite planar rooted [[trees]] (not necessarily binary as in the previous example). 

* Let $C$ be the coslice category $\mathbb{Z} \downarrow Ab$, and let $F: C \to C$ be the functor which pushes out along the multiplication-by-$p$ map $p \cdot -: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. Then the initial $F$-algebra is the [[Pruefer group]] $\mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}]/\mathbb{Z}$. See the discussion at the n-Category Caf&eacute;, starting [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/coalgebraically_thinking.html#c020660). 

* Let $Ban$ be the category of complex Banach spaces and maps of norm bounded above by $1$, and let $F: \mathbb{C} \downarrow Ban \to \mathbb{C} \downarrow Ban$ be the squaring functor $X \mapsto X \times X$. Then the initial $F$-algebra is $L^1([0, 1])$ (with respect to the usual Lebesgue measure). This result is due to [[Tom Leinster]]; see this [MathOverflow discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/23143/what-theorem-constructs-an-initial-object-for-this-category-formerly-integrabi/78262#78262).
