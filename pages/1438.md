An initial algebra for an endofunctor $F$ on a category $C$ is an [[initial object]] in the category of [[algebra|algebras]] of $F$.

If $F$ has an initial algebra, $\alpha: F(X) \to X$, then $X$ is isomorphic to $F(X)$.

$X$ is a smallest fixed point of $F$.

The dual concept is [[terminal coalgebra]].
