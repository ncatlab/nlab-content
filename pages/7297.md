A __regular local ring__ $R$ is a Noetherian commutative unital [[local ring]] whose [[Krull dimension]] agrees with the minimal number of generators of its maximal ideal $I$. Equivalently, the Krull dimension equals $dim_k (I/I^2)$ where $k = R/I$ is the residue field of $R$. A Noetherian local ring is regular iff its global dimension is finite; it follows that its global and Krull dimension coincide.
