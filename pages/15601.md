## Idea

A (general) __Ricatti differential equation__ is any first-order [[ordinary differential equation]] for a function $y = y(z)$ which is of the form

$$
\frac{d y}{d z} = a_0(z) + a_1(z) y + a_2(z) y^2 
$$

with $a_0(z)\neq 0$ and $a_2(z)\neq 0$. 


## Correspondence with 2nd order linear ODEs

There is a correspondence between Ricatti equations and a wide class of
2nd order linear differential equations, namely Ricatti equation for $y$ gives a 2nd order linear ODE for $u$ which satisfies $a_2 u' = u y$, namely

$$
u'' + a_0 a_2 u' + \left( a_1 + \frac{a_2'}{a_2} \right) u = 0.
$$
Of course, the coefficients are non-constant.


## Reduction to a Bernoulli ODE in the presence of a particular solution

Unlike the [[Bernoulli differential equation]] which has $a_0(z) = 0$ and $a_2(z) \neq 0$, the Ricatti equation can not be solved in quadratures in general, unless a a particular solution $y_1$ is known. If so, then we can write $y = y_1 + u$ and
write down the equation for $u$ which appears to be an example of a Bernoulli differential equation, hence solvable in quadratures. Regarding that $w = 1/u$ is
the substitution for reducing Bernoulli to first order linear ODE, we can reduce
the original Ricatti to such ODE by substituting $y = y_1 + 1/w$.
