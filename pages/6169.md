## Definition

### Traditional definition

A [[submanifold]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] each [[tangent space]] of which is an [[isotropic subspace]] with respect to the ambient symplectic structure is an **isotropic submanifold**.

### In cohesive higher geometry

The following is a suggestion for an axiomatization of ([[foliations]] by) isotropic subspaces in the context [[differential cohesion]], followed by some considerations showing how these axioms reproduce traditional theory. 

> Under construction.

So let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] equipped with [[differential cohesion]].

As usual, we write $(\int \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ for the [[adjoint triple]] of [[modalities]] that defines the [[cohesion]] -- [[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]] -- and we write $(Red \dashv \int_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf})$ for the adjoint triple of of modalities that defines the [[differential cohesion]] -- [[reduction modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal flat modality]]. 

Below we are going to axiomatize aspects of the traditional description of [[foliations]] by [[Lie groupoids]]/[[foliation groupoids]], so we start by briefly setting up some terminology on groupoids in differential cohesion.

If we think of a [[1-epimorphism]] $\mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}$ in $\mathbf{H}$ as the [[atlas]] on the cohesive $\infty$-groupoid $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbf{H}$, hence, by the [[Giraud-Rezk-Lurie axioms]], equivalently as a [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|groupoid object]] $\mathcal{G}_\bullet = \mathcal{G}_0^{\times^{\bullet+1}_{\mathcal{G}}}$, then we have the following "geometricity" constraints on groupoid objects

###### Definition

For $f \colon X \to Y$ any morphism in $\mathbf{H}$, write 

$$
  X \stackrel{L(f)}{\to} Y \underset{\int_{inf} Y}{\times} \int_{inf} X
$$

for the canonical morphism induced by the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the $\int_{inf}$-[[unit of an adjunction|unti]]. We say that

1. $f$ is a **[[formally smooth morphism]]** (or _[[submersion]]_) if $L(f)$ is a [[1-epimorphism]]

1. $f$ is a **[[formally étale morphism]]** (or _[[local diffeomorphism]]_) if $L(f)$ is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]].

Moreover, if $\pi \colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}$ is a [[1-epimorphism]], hence an [[atlas]] for the cohesive $\infty$-groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, then we say about the corresponding [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category|groupoid object]] that

1. $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ is an [[geometric ∞-groupoid]] if its [[atlas]] $\pi$ is a [[formally smooth morphism]]/[[submersion]].

1. $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ is an [[étale ∞-groupoid]] if its [[atlas]] $\pi$ is a [[formally étale morphism]]/[[local diffeomorphism]].

###### Definition

For $X \in \mathbf{H}$ a **[[foliation]]** of $X$ is 
a morphism $\mathcal{D} \colon X \to X//\mathcal{D}$ in $\mathbf{H}$ which is 

1. a [[1-epimorphism]];

1. a [[formally smooth morphism]].

Equivalently a foliation of $X$ is a map that exhibits $X$ as an [[atlas]]
for a [[geometric infinity-groupoid]], def. \ref{GeometricAndEtale}.

Given a foliation $\mathcal{D}$ on $X$ we say that the **the leaf decomposition** of $X$ induced by the foliation is the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] 

$$
  LeafDec(\mathcal{D})
  \coloneqq
  \flat(X//\mathcal{D}) \underset{X//\mathcal{D}}{\times} X
$$ 

in 

$$
  \array{
    LeafDec(\mathcal{D}) &\stackrel{\iota_{\mathcal{D}}}{\to}& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathcal{D}}}
    \\
    \flat (X//\mathcal{D}) &\to& X//\mathcal{D}
  }
  \,.
$$

Now let $\mathbb{G} \in Grp_2(\mathbf{H})$ a [[braided ∞-group]]. Write

$$
  \Omega^2_{cl} := \Omega^2_{flat}(-,\mathbb{G})
$$ 

for the corresponding coefficient object for [[curvature]] forms of $\mathbb{G}$-[[principal ∞-connections]] (as discussed there).

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Given a closed 2-form 

$$
  \omega \;\colon\; X \to \Omega^2_{cl}
$$

a foliation of $X$ by **$\omega$-isotropic subspaces** is a [[foliation]] $\mathcal{D} \colon X \to X//\mathcal{D}$
as in def. \ref{FoliationInDifferentialCohesion} such that the restriction of $\omega$ to the leaf decomposition is equivalent to the 0-form

$$
  \iota_{\mathcal{D}}^* \omega \simeq 0
  \,,
$$

hence such that the top composite morphism in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    (\flat \mathcal{E}) \underset{\mathcal{E}}{\times} X
    &\to& X &\stackrel{\omega}{\to}& \Omega^2_{cl}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \flat (X//\mathcal{D}) &\to& X//\mathcal{D}
  }
$$

factors through the point.

We now discuss how low-degree examples of this axiomatics interpreted in $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq $ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] reproduces the traditional notions of [[foliations]] and isotropic submanifolds of [[pre-symplectic manifolds]].
