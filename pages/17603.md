__Hyperalgebra__ of an affine algebraic group $G$ is the [[finite dual]]s of the Hopf algebra of [[representative function]]s of $G$. It can be interpreted (and is sometimes called) the algebra of distributions supported at unit. This algebra comes with a natural filtration. In characteristic $0$ it coincides (by L. Schwarz's theorem) with the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the Lie algebra of $G$, but it is much bigger in positive characteristic. It can also be obtained by base change from the Kostant's integral form of the universal enveloping algebra of the complex Lie algebra associated to $G$.

Some books on algebraic groups and on [[Hopf algebra]]s have chapters dedicated to this topic e.g.

* C. Jantzen, _Representations of algebraic groups_, chapter 7
* Η. Yanagihara, _Theory of Hopf algebras attached to group schemes_, Springer Lecture
