## Idea

A _Lawvere--Tierney topology_  (or _operator_ , or _modality_ , also called _geometric modality_) on a [[topos]] is a way of saying that something is 'locally' [[true]].  Unlike a [[Grothendieck topology]], this is done directly at the stage of [[logic]], defining a _[[geometric logic]]_.  In fact, it is a generalisation of Grothendieck topology in this sense: If $C$ is a [[small category]], then choosing a Grothendieck topology on $C$ is equivalent to choosing a Lawvere--Tierney topology in the [[presheaf topos]] $\Set^{C^\op}$ on $C$.

The use of "topology" for this and the related Grothendieck concept is regarded by some people as unfortunate; see [[Grothendieck topology]] for some reasons why.  A proposed replacement for "Grothendieck topology" is [[coverage|(Grothendieck) coverage]]; see [[Grothendieck topology]] for some possible replacements for "Lawvere--Tierney topology."


## Definition

Let $E$ be a [[topos]], with [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$. 


### The closure operator

+-- {: .num_defn #LTTopologyDef}
###### Definition

A __Lawvere--Tierney topology__ in $E$ is an ([[internalization|internally]]) a [[exact functor|left exact]] [[monad]] on the internal meet-[[semilattice]] $\Omega$. 

This means that: a Lawvere--Tierney topology in $E$ is a [[morphism]] 

$$
  j: \Omega \to \Omega
$$ 

such that

1. $j true = true$, equivalently $\id_\Omega \leq j: \Omega \to \Omega$ ('if $p$ is true, then $p$ is locally true')

   $$
     \array{
       * &\stackrel{true}{\to}& \Omega
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{true}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}
       \\
       && \Omega
     }
   $$

1. $j j = j$ (‘$p$ is locally locally true iff $p$ is locally true');

   $$
     \array{
       \Omega &\stackrel{j}{\to}& \Omega
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{j}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}
       \\
       && \Omega
     }
   $$

1. $j \circ \wedge = \wedge \circ (j \times j)$ (‘$p \wedge q$ is locally true iff $p$ and $q$ are each locally true')

   $$
     \array{
       \Omega \times \Omega &\stackrel{\wedge}{\to}& \Omega
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{j \times j}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}
       \\
       \Omega \times \Omega &\underset{\wedge}{\to}& \Omega
     }
     \,.
   $$

=--

Here $\leq$ is the internal [[partial order]] on $\Omega$, and $\wedge: \Omega \times \Omega \to \Omega$ is the internal [[meet]].

This appears for instance as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, V 1.](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .num_remark #LTTopologyAsSubobject}
###### Remark

By the definition of [[subobject classifier]] $j$ is equivalently a [[subobject]]

$$
  J \hookrightarrow \Omega
$$

satisfying three conditions. This perspective gives the direct relation to [[Grothendieck topologies]], as discussed [below](RelationToGrothendieckTopology).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Equivalently, the third axiom in def. \ref{LTTopologyDef} can be replaced with the (internal) statement that $j$ is order-preserving.

The equivalence amounts to the fact that, within the [[internal logic]] of [[topoi]], one can demonstrate that every [[monad]] on the [[preorder]] of [[truth values]] is in fact [[strong monad|strong]] (a special case of the fact that, for an [[endofunctor]] on some [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed]] $V$, [[tensorial strength|tensorial strengths]] are the same as $V$-[[enriched category|enrichments]], as described in the article on the former), and therefore _automatically_ preserves finite meets. 

Thus, a Lawvere-Tierney topology is the same thing as an internal [[closure operator]] on the preorder $\Omega$ (aka, a [[Moore closure]] on the one-element set), which amounts to the same thing as a natural closure operator on subobjects.

Specifically, given any [[subobject]] inclusion $X \hookrightarrow Y$ in $E$, consider its [[characteristic morphism]] $\chi_X: Y \to \Omega$. Then $j \circ \chi_X$ is another morphism $Y \to \Omega$, which defines another subobject $j_*(X)$ of $Y$, taken as the closure of our original subobject. The elements of $j_*(X)$ are those elements of $Y$ that are 'locally' in $X$.

###### Definition

The **closure operator** induced by $j$ is the [[natural transformation|transformation]]

$$
  \overline{(-)}_X : Sub(X) \to Sub(X)
$$

on the [[subobject]] lattice of $X \in E$, [[natural transformation|natural]] in $X$, that is given by the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    Hom(X, \Omega) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& Sub(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{Hom(X,j)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\overline{(-)}}}
    \\
    Hom(X,\Omega) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& Sub(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that for $U \hookrightarrow X$ a [[subobject]], with characteristic morphism $char U : X \to \Omega$, its closure is the subobject classified by

$$
  char \overline{U} : X \stackrel{char U}{\to} \Omega \stackrel{j}{\to} \Omega
  \,.

A morphism $j : \Omega \to \Omega$ is a Lawvere-Tierney topology, def. \ref{LTTopologyDef} precisely if the corresponding closure operator, def. \ref{TheClosureOperator} satisfies for all $X, Y \in E$

1. $A \subset \overline{A}$;

1. $\overline{\overline{A}} = A$;

### Sheaves

Using Lawvere--Tierney topologies, 
the notion of [[sheaf]] and [[sheafification]] generalizes from [[Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck topoi]] to arbitrary topoi. 

Let $E$ be a [[topos]] with Lawvere-Tierney topology $j$, def. \ref{LTTopologyDef} and associated closure operator $\overline{(-)} : Sub(-) \to Sub(-)$, def. \ref{TheClosureOperator}.

+-- {: .num_defn #DenseMonos}
###### Definition

A subobject $U \in Sub(X)$ is called **dense** if $\overline{U} = U$.

The corresponding [[monomorphism]] $U \hookrightarrow X$ is called a **[[dense monomorphism]]**.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #JSheaf} 
###### Definition

An object $A \in E$ is called a **$j$-[[sheaf]]** if it is a [[local object]] with respect to the dense monomorphisms.

This means that $A$ is a $j$-sheaf if for every dense $U \hookrightarrow X$ the induced morphism

$$
  Hom(X,F) \to Hom(U,F)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

$F$ is a **$j$-[[separated presheaf]]** if this morphism is itself a [[monomorphism]].

This is for instance in ([MacLaneMoerdijk, p. 223](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .num_prop #RelationToCoveringSieves}
###### Proposition

For $E$ a [[topos]] and $j$ a Lawvere-Tierney topology on $E$, the inclusion

$$
  Sh_j(E) \hookrightarrow E
$$

of [j-sheaves](#JSheaf) is a [[geometric embedding]]. 

So in particular $Sh_j(E)$ is itself a [[topos]] and the embedding is a [[full and faithful functor]] which has a [[exact functor|left exact]] [[left adjoint]] functor $E \to Sh_j(E)$: this is called the **[[sheafification]]** functor.

#### Equivalence with Grothendieck topologies
 {#RelationToGrothendieckTopology}


+-- {: .num_prop #RelationToCoveringSieves}
###### Proposition

For $C$ a [[small category]] and $E := [C^{op}, Set]$ its [[presheaf topos]], Lawvere--Tierney topologies in $E$ are equivalent to [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] on $C$.  

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that the [[subobject classifier]] in a [[presheaf topos]] is the  presheaf that assigns to $U \in C$ the set of all [[sieve]]s in $C$ on $U$

$$
  \Omega : U \mapsto Sieves_C(U)
  \,.
$$

A [[subobject]] $J \hookrightarrow \Omega$ is therefore precisely a choice of a collection of sieves on each object, which is closed under pullback. The proof therefore amounts to checking that the condition that such a collection of sieves is a [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$ is equivalent to the statement that the characteristic map $j : \Omega \to Omega$ of $J \hookrightarrow \Omega$ (see remark \ref{LTTopologyAsSubobject}) is a Lawvere-Tierney topology. 

=--

Here is more discussion of this point:

Suppose that $C$ is a small site.  Then given a [[subpresheaf]] inclusion $F \hookrightarrow G$ in $\Set^{C^\op}$, an object $X$ of $C$, and an element $f$ of $G(X)$, we say $f$ is locally in $F$ (that is, $f \in j_*(F)(X)$) if and only if, for some [[cover|covering family]] $c = (c_i: U_i \to X)_i$ on $X$, the restriction $c^*(f)$ of $f$ to $c$ is in $F$ (that is, each $c_i^*(f) \in F(U_i)$).  This intuitively defines the "local" modality that is the Lawvere--Tierney topology corresponding to the given Grothendieck topology on $C$.

As a specific example, take the usual Grothendieck topology on [[Top]], given by the usual notion of open cover. Taking real-valued functions on a space defines a presheaf (in fact a sheaf) $G: X \mapsto [X,R]$ on $\Top$; the constant functions form a subpresheaf $F$ of $G$. A real-valued function $f: X \to R$ belongs to $j_*(F)$ iff it is *locally* constant; that is, for some open cover $(U_i)_i$ of the domain $X$, each restriction $f|U_i$ is constant.

To make this precise in terms of the above definition, we need to understand the subobject classifier in $E = Set^{C^{op}}$.  But according to the definition, $\Omega$ is simply the representing object for the functor 
$$Sub: E^{op} \to Set$$ 
which takes an object $F$ of $E$ to the collection of subobjects of $F$, $Sub(F)$. In other words, $Sub(F) \cong \hom_E(F, \Omega)$. Applied to $F = \hom_C(-, c)$, we have then 
$$Sub(\hom_C(-, c)) \cong \hom_{Set^{C^{op}}}(\hom_C(-, c), \Omega) \stackrel{Yoneda}{\cong} \Omega(c)$$ 
In other words, we find that the functor $\Omega: C^{op} \to Set$ is defined by 
$$\Omega(c) = \{sieves on c\}$$ 

Next, if $J$ is a Grothendieck topology on $C$, then the collection of $J$-covering sieves on $c$ [which we denote by $J(c)$] is a subcollection of all sieves on $c$, and so we have an inclusion 
$$J(c) \hookrightarrow \Omega(c)$$ 
and this inclusion is natural in $c$, by virtue of the first axiom on covering sieves. Thus we have a subobject
$$J \hookrightarrow \Omega$$ 
and again, by definition of subobject classifier, this subobject corresponds to a uniquely determined element 
$$j \in \hom_E(\Omega, \Omega)$$ 
which is just the Lawvere--Tierney operator $j: \Omega \to \Omega$.

Conversely, any morphism $j:\Omega\to\Omega$ determines a subobject $J$ of $\Omega$, which therefore associates to every object $c$ a set of sieves on $c$.  It is easy to check that the axioms for covering sieves in a Grothendieck topology correspond exactly to the required properties of the operator $j$.

###### Observation

For $C$ a [[small site]] and $j$ the Lawvere-Tierney topology on the [[presheaf topos]] $E = [C^{op}, Set]$ given by prop. \ref{RelationToCoveringSieves} the [j-sheaves](#SheafSubtoposes) are precisely the [[sheaves]] in the ordinary sense of Grothendieck topologies.

#### Enriched generalization

* Francis Borceux, _Sheaves of algebras for a commutative theory_, Ann. Soc. Sci. Bruxelles Sér. I __95__ (1981), no. 1, 3–19, [MR83c:18006](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=628032)

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category enriched over $Set^{T}$ where $T$ is a [[commutative algebraic theory]]. Then $[\mathcal{C}^{op},\text{Set}^{T}]$. A $T$-sieve as an enriched subfunctor of $\mathcal{C}(-,x)\colon\mathcal{C}^{op}\rightarrow\text{Set}^{T}$. A $\mathbf{T}$-topology is a set $J(x)$ of $\mathbf{T}$-sieves for every $x$, satisfying some axioms. Borceux defines the notion of a sheaf over such enriched site and proves the existence and exactness of the associated sheaf functor. 

He proves that there is an object $\Omega_{T}$ in $[\mathcal{C}^{op},\text{Set}]$ which classifies subobjects in $[\mathcal{C}^{op},\text{Set}^{T}]$. Moreover, there is a correspondence betwen

(1) localizations of $[\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}},\text{Set}^{T}]$ 

(2) $T$-topologies on $\mathcal{C}$

(3) morphisms $j\colon\Omega_{\mathbf{T}}\rightarrow\Omega_{T}$ satisfying the Lawvere-Tierney axioms for a topology
