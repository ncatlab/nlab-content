The __specialisation topology__ is a way of turning any [[preorder]]ed set $P$ into a [[topological space]] (with the same underlying set).

A subset $A$ of $P$ is declared __open__ if it is upwards-closed.  That is, if $x \leq y$ and $x \in A$, then $y \in A$.  One may also use the convention that the open sets are the downwards-closed subsets; this is the specialisation topology on the [[opposite category|opposite]] $P^\op$.

Compare the [[Scott topology]], which is coarser.

# Examples

* [[Sierpinski space]] is the set of [[truth value]]s with the specialisation topology.

# Properties

$P$ is a [[partial order|poset]] if and only if its specialisation topology is $T_0$.
