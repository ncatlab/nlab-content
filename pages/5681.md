## Definition

###### Definition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] and $f : A \to B$ and $g : X \to Y$ two [[morphism]]s in $C$. Write $C_{A\sslash Y}$ for the [[over-(∞,1)-category|under-over-(∞,1)-category]].

We say that $f$ is **left orthogonal** to $g$ and that $g$ is **right orthogonal** to $f$ and write

$$
  f \perp g
$$

if for every [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    B &\to& Y
  }
$$

in $C$ we have that $C_{A\sslash Y}(B,X) \simeq *$ is [[contractible]].

=--

Note that the notation $C_{A\sslash Y}(B,X)$ subtly includes the given commuting diagram, since $C_{A\sslash Y}$ is only defined relative to a particular given morphism $A\to Y$.  Here we take that to be the common composite of the given commuting square, with $B$ and $X$ regarded as objects of $C_{A\sslash Y}$ via the resulting commuting triangles.

###### Definition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]]. An **orthogonal factorization system** on $C$ is a pair $(S_L, S_R)$ of [[class]]es of [[morphism]]s in $C$ that satisfy the following axioms.

1. Both classes are stable under [[retract]]s.

1. Every morphism in $S_L$ is left orthogonal to every morphism in $S_R$;

1. For every morphism $h : X \to Z$ in $C$ there exists a commuting triangle

   $$
     \array{
        && Y
        \\
        & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
        \\
       X &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& Z
     }
   $$

   with $f \in S_L$ and $g \in S_R$.

## Properties

### Closure properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $(L,R)$ a factorization system in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$, the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[arrow category]] $Func(\Delta^1, \mathcal{C})$ on the morphisms in $R$ is closed under [[(∞,1)-limits]] of shapes that exist in $\mathcal{C}$. Similarly the full subcategory on $L$ is closed under [[(∞,1)-colimits]] that exist in $\mathcal{C}$.

=--

This is ([Lurie, prop. 5.2.8.6 (7), (8)](#Lurie)).

### Reflection

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


Let $(L,R)$ be an orthogonal factorization system on an $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$. Write $\mathcal{C}^I_R \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}^I$ for the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the arrow category on the morphisms in $R$.

Then

1. this is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]]

   $$
     \mathcal{C}^I_R \stackrel{\stackrel{}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
     \mathcal{C}^I
   $$

1. The [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction units]] 
   $\eta_f : f \to \bar f$ are of the form

   $$
     \array{
        X &\stackrel{\in L}{\to}& \bar X
        \\
        {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\bar f \in R} }
        \\
        Y &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& \bar Y
     }
     \,.
   $$

   (In words: the reflection into $\mathcal{C}^I_R$ is given by the factorization in $(L,R)$).

=--

This is ([Lurie, lemma 5.2.8.19](#Lurie)).


## Examples

* In an [[(∞,1)-topos]] the classe of [[n-connected]] and that of [[n-truncated]] morphisms form an orthogonal factorization system, for all $(-2) \leq n \leq \infty $. 

  See [[(n-connected, n-truncated) factorization system]].
