##Idea

The _profinite completion_ functor (on [[topological spaces]]) is the [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion of the category of  [[profinite spaces]] into that of all [[topological spaces]]. It is particularly useful when applied to [[discrete topological spaces]] (i.e. really: [[sets]]!).

## Definition:

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].  A *profinite completion* of $X$ is a [[profinite space]], $\hat{X}$, together with a [[continuous map]], $\eta_X : X \to \hat{X}$, such that, if given any profinite space, $Y$, and a continuous map, $g : X \to Y$, there is a unique continuous map $\psi : \hat{X}\to Y$ with $\psi \eta_X = g$
