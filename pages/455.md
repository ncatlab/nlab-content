## Idea

A Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is an algebraic structure which models classical [[propositional calculus]], roughly the fragment of the logical calculus which deals with the basic logical connectives "and", "or", "implies", and "not". 


## Definitions

There are many known ways of defining a __Boolean algebra__ or __Boolean lattice__. Here are just a few: 

* A Boolean algebra is a [[complement|complemented]] [[distributive lattice]]. 

* A Boolean algebra is a [[Heyting algebra]] $H$ satisfying the law of excluded middle, which means either 
$$\neg \neg = id: H \to H$$ 
or (equivalently) 
$$\forall_{x \in H} x \vee \neg x = \top$$

* A Boolean algebra is a [[lattice]] $L$ equipped with a function $\neg: L \to L$ satisfying 
$$a \wedge b \leq c \qquad iff \qquad a \leq \neg b \vee c$$

### Explicitly

There are even two explicit definitions: order-theoretic and algebraic.

A __Boolean lattice__ is a [[poset]] such that:

*  there is an element $\top$ (a [[top element]]) such that $x \leq \top$ always holds;
*  there is an element $\bot$ (a [[bottom element]]) such that $\bot \leq x$ always holds;
*  given elements $a$ and $b$, there is an element $a \wedge b$ (a [[meet]] of $a$ and $b$) such that $x \leq a \wedge b$ holds iff $x \leq a$ and $x \leq b$;
*  given elements $a$ and $b$, there is an element $a \vee b$ (a [[join]] of $a$ and $b$) such that $a \vee b \leq x$ holds iff $a \leq x$ and $b \leq x$;
*  given an element $a$, there is an element $\neg{a}$ (a [[complement]] of $a$) such that $a \wedge \neg{a} \leq \bot$ and $\top \leq a \vee \neg{a}$;
*  given elements $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have $a \wedge (b \vee c) \leq (a \wedge b) \vee (a \wedge c)$.

Although we don\'t say so, we can prove that $\top$, $\bot$, $a \wedge b$, $a \vee b$, and $\neg{a}$ are unique; this makes it more clear what the last two axioms actually mean.

Alternatively, a __Boolean algebra__ is a [[set]] equipped with elements $\top$ and $\bot$, binary operations $\wedge$ and $\vee$, and a unary operation $\neg$, satisfying these identities:

*  $a \wedge \top = a$,
*  $a \vee \bot = a$,
*  $a \wedge (b \wedge c) = (a \wedge b) \wedge c$,
*  $a \vee (b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c$,
*  $a \wedge b = b \wedge a$,
*  $a \vee b = b \vee a$,
*  $a \wedge (a \vee b) = a$,
*  $a \vee (a \wedge b) = a$,
*  $a \wedge (b \vee c) = (a \wedge b) \vee (a \wedge c)$,
*  $a \wedge \neg{a} = \bot$,
*  $a \vee \neg{a} = \top$.

We can recover the poset structure: $a \leq b$ iff $a \wedge b = a$.

## Homomorphisms

Any [[lattice]] homomorphism automatically preserves $\neg$ and is therefore a Boolean algebra homomorphism.

Boolean algebras and Boolean algebra homomorphisms form a [[concrete category]] [[BoolAlg]]. 

## Definition via Lawvere theories 

The concrete category $U: BoolAlg \to Set$ is [[monadic functor|monadic]]: the category of Boolean algebras is the [[Eilenberg-Moore category|category of algebras]] for a [[finitary monad]], or equivalently it is the category of algebras for a [[Lawvere theory]]. In this case the Lawvere theory is very easily described. 

Ihe Lawvere theory is equivalent to the category opposite to the category of finitely generated free Boolean algebras (or of finitely generated free Boolean rings, if one prefers). In parallel to polynomial rings, the free Boolean ring on $n$ elements may be constructed, &agrave; la Beck [[distributive law]]s, as the monoid algebra $\mathbb{Z}_2[M_n]$ where $M_n$ is the free commutative idempotent monoid on $n$ elements, which itself has $2^n$ elements. 

The free Boolean algebra on $n$ elements is therefore isomorphic to $P(2^n)$, the [[power set]] of a $2^n$-element set. Applying a "toy" form of [[Stone duality]], the category of finitely generated free Boolean algebras is equivalent to the category of finite sets of cardinality $2^n$. 

Hence the Lawvere theory is identified with the category $Fin_{2^n}$ of finite sets of cardinality $2^n$, and the category of Boolean algebras is equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors 

$$Fin_{2^n} \to Set.$$ 

## Unbiased Boolean algebras

Observe that the [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of $Fin_{2^n}$ is $Fin_+$, the category of nonempty finite sets. (Indeed, every nonempty finite set is the retract of some set with $2^n$ elements.) 

+-- {: .un_prop}
######Proposition 
Let $C$ be a category with finite products, and let $i: C \hookrightarrow \widebar{C}$ be its Cauchy completion. Then $\widebar{C}$ has finite products, and the category of product-preserving functors $\widebar{C} \to Set$ is equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors $C \to Set$, via restriction along $i$. 
=--

By this proposition, the category of Boolean algebras is equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors 

$$Fin_+ \to Set$$

We call a product-preserving functor $Fin_+ \to Set$ an **unbiased Boolean algebra**. The idea here is that the usual concrete way of viewing Boolean algebras is inherently biased towards sets of cardinality $2^n$. Passing to the Cauchy completion removes that bias. 

## $k$-biased Boolean algebras 

Alternatively, we could apply the previous proposition in reverse and view Boolean algebras as a concrete category in an entirely different way. For example, the Lawvere theory given by the category of finite sets of cardinality $3^n$ has the same Cauchy completion $Fin_+$. Therefore, the category of product-preserving functors 

$$X: Fin_{3^n} \to Set$$ 

is also equivalent to the category of Boolean algebras. Only here, the appropriate underlying set functor sends $X$ to $X(3)$, the value at the generator $3$. 

Similarly, for each fixed cardinality $k \gt 1$, there is a Lawvere theory $Fin_{k^n}$, and they all lead to Boolean algebras as the category of algebras for the theory. The difference is in the associated monadic functor, $U_k: Prod(Fin_{k^n}, Set) \to Set$. 

A curious phenomenon that holds for each $k \geq 3$ (but **not** for $k = 2$) is as follows. Let $Un_k$ be the Lawvere subtheory of $Fin_{k^n}$ generated by just the unary operations, so that the algebras of $Un_k$ are identified with sets equipped with actions of the monoid $M_k = \hom(k, k)$ (endofunctions of the $k$-element set under composition), aka $M_k$-sets. By restriction of operations, there is an evident forgetful functor 

$$BoolAlg \to M_k\text{-}Set$$

+-- {: .un_prop} 
######Proposition 
For each $k \geq 3$, the forgetful functor from $BoolAlg \to$ $M_k$-$Set$ realizes $BoolAlg$ as a _full_ subcategory of $M_k$-Set.
