## Idea

A useful way to visualise and manipulate [[knot]]s is to project the knot onto a plane. A small change in the direction of projection will ensure that it is one-to-one except at the double points, called *crossings*, where the image curve of the knot crosses itself once transversely. At each crossing, so as to be able to recreate the original knot, the over-strand must be distinguished from the under-strand. This is usually done by creating a break in the strand going underneath.

## Details

A knot $K$ is usually specified by a projection to a plane.  Consider the parallel projection

$$p: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2$$

defined by $p(x,y,z) = (x,y,0)$  

(If you prefer your knots to be in $S^3$, of course, you can remove a single point from the complement of $K$ and then project down to $\mathbf{R}^3$.  It does not matter which point you use.)

A point $\mathbf{x}$ in the image $pK$ is called a *multiple point* if $p^{-1}(\mathbf{x})$ contains more than one point of $K$.  A *double point* occurs when there are exactly two points of $K$ in this and a *triple point* ... etc.  Multiple points of infinite order could occur.

A knot is in *regular position* with respect to $p$ if there are only double points and these are genuine crossings (i.e. no tangential touching occurs in the projected curve).

## Properties

Any smooth or PL knot $K$ is equivalent under an arbitrarily small rotation of $\mathbf{R}^3$ to one in regular position with respect to $p$.

A proof can be found in Crowell and Fox (page 7).

Once given such a projection one can construct a diagram from it in the manner sketched out at the top of the page. 

##Link diagrams

The above discussion can be easily extended to handle [[links]] as well as knots.
