## Idea

_Mayer-Vietoris sequence_ is the term for the [[fiber sequence]] -- or often for the corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] -- induced from an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] (or for a [[homotopy pullback]] presenting it).

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]] and let $X, Y, B$ be [[pointed objects]] and

$$
  f : X \to B
$$

and

$$
  g : Y \to B
$$

be any two [[morphisms]] with common [[codomain]] preserving the base points. Let $X \times_B Y$ be the [[(∞,1)-pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X \times_B Y &\to& Y
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding **Mayer-Vietoris sequence** is the [[fiber sequence]] of the induced morphism $X \times_B Y \to X \times Y$. Often the term is used (only) for the corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]].

## Properties

### General

+-- {: .num_prop #SequenceFromDiagonal}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]]. 

Then $X \times_B Y$ is equivalently given by the [[(∞,1)-pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X \times_B Y &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Delta_B}}
    \\
    X \times Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& B \times B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the right vertical morphism is the [[diagonal]].

Moreover, the [[homotopy fiber]] of $X \times_B Y \to X \times Y$ is the [[loop space object]] $\Omega B$.

=--
 
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement one checks for instance by choosing a presentation by a [[combinatorial model category]] and then proceeding as below in the discussion _[Presentation by fibrant objects](#PresentationByFibrantObjects)_.
Then by the [[pasting law]] for $(\infty,1)$-pullbacks it follows that with the left square in 

$$
  \array{
    \Omega B &\to& X \times_B Y &\to & B
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& X \times Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& B \times B
  }
$$

an $(\infty,1)$-pullback, so is the total outer rectangle. But again by the first statement, this is equivalent to the $(\infty,1)$-pullback

$$
  \array{
    \Omega B &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& B
  }
  \,,
$$

which is the defining pullback for the [[loop space object]].

=--

Therefore the Mayer-Vietoris [[fiber sequence]] is of the form

$$
  \Omega B \to X \times_B Y \to X \times Y
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

The corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] starts out as

$$
  \cdots \to \pi_{n+1} B \to \pi_n X \times_B Y \stackrel{(f_*, g_*)}{\to} \pi_n X \oplus \pi_n Y \stackrel{f_* - g_*}{\to} \pi_n B \to \cdots 
$$

$$
  \cdots \to \pi_2 B \to \pi_1 X \times_B Y \stackrel{(f_+, g_*)}{\to}  \pi_1 X \times \pi_1 Y \stackrel{f_* \cdot g_*^{-1}}{\to} \pi_1 B \to \pi_0 X \times_B Y \to \pi_0 (X \times Y)
  \,.
$$

=--

This has historically been the definition of Mayer-Vietories sequences ([Eckmann-Hilton](#EckmannHilton)).

### Presentation by fibrant objects
 {#PresentationByFibrantObjects}

Suppose that the [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is [[simplicial localization|presented]] by a [[category of fibrant objects]] $C$ (for instance the [[subcategory]] on the fibrant objects of a [[model category]]). 

Then the $(\infty,1)$-pullback $X \times_B Y$ is presented by a [[homotopy pullback]], and by the [[factorization lemma]], this is given by the ordinary [[limit]]

$$
  \array{
    X \times^h_B Y &\to& &\to& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    && B^I &\to& B 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where $B \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B^I \to B \times B$ is a [[path object]] for $B$. This limit coincides, up to [[isomorphism]], with the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    X \times_B^h Y &\to& B^I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X \times Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& B \times B
  }
  \,.
$$

This implies in particular that the [[homotopy fiber]] of $X \times_B^h Y \to X \times Y$ is the [[loop space object]] $\Omega B$, being the [[fiber]] of the [[path space object]] projection.

### Over an $\infty$-group
 {#OverAGroupObject}

We consider the special case where $B$ is an abelian [[∞-group]] in a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$.

In this case we have an [[(∞,1)-pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    B &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Delta_B}} 
    &\swArrow_{\simeq}& 
    \downarrow^\mathrlap{0}
    \\
    B \times B
    &\stackrel{-}{\to}&
    B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the bottom horizontal morphism is the composite

$$
  - : B \times B \stackrel{(id, (-)^{-1})}{\to} B \times B \stackrel{+}{\to} B
$$

of a morphism that sends the second argument to its inverse with the group composition operation.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Let $S$ be a small [[site]] and let $\mathcal{C} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ be the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $S$.

This is [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  \mathcal{C} \simeq ([S^{op}, sSet]_{proj, loc})^\circ
  \,.
$$

As discussed there, the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] prolongs to a [[Quillen adjunction]] on [[presheaves]] whose [[right adjoint]] is

$$
  \Xi : 
  [S^{op}, Ch_{\bullet \leq 0}(Ab)]_{proj}
  \to 
  [S^{op}, sAb]_{proj}
  \to
  [S^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,.
$$

Let then $B \in \mathcal{C}$ be an object with a presentation in $[S^{op}, sSet]$ in the image of this $\Xi$. We write $B$ also for this presentation, and hence $B = \Xi(\tilde B)$ for some presheaf of chain complexes $\tilde B$. 

We claim now that such $B$ satisfies the above assumption.

To see this, first notice that the evident morphism $- : \tilde B \times \tilde B \to \tilde B$ is degreewise an [[epimorphism]], hence it is a fibration in $[S^{op}, Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(Ab)]_{proj}$, and since $\Xi$ is [[Quillen adjunction|right Quillen]], so is the corresponding morphism $- : B \times B \to B$ in $[S^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$. 

Therefore the ordiary pullback of presheaves of chain complexes

$$
  \array{
    \tilde B &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Delta_{\tilde B}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{0}}
    \\
    \tilde B \times \tilde B &\stackrel{-}{\to}& \tilde B
  }
$$

is a [[homotopy pullback]] in $[S^{op}, Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(Ab)]_{proj}$, as is the ordinary pullback of simplicial presheaves

$$
  \array{
    B &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Delta_B}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{0}}
    \\
    B \times B &\stackrel{-}{\to}& B
  }
$$

in $[S^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$.

Since [[∞-stackification]] preserves [[finite (∞,1)-limits]], this presents an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] also in $\mathcal{C}$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Observation

For $B$ an [[∞-group]] object as above, the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] $X \times_B Y$ is equivalently given by the $(\infty,1)$-pullback

$$
  \array{
   X \times_B Y &\to& * 
   \\
   \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{0}}
   \\ 
   X \times Y &\stackrel{f-g}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{SequenceFromDiagonal} the object $X \times_B Y$ is the $(\infty,1)$-pullback in

$$
  \array{
    X \times_B Y &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Delta_B}}
    \\
    X \times Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& B \times B
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[pasting law]] this is equivalently given by the  composite pullback of 

$$
  \array{
    X \times_B Y &\to& B &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow 
    &\swArrow_{\simeq}& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Delta_B}}
    &\swArrow_{\simeq}& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{0}}
    \\
    X \times Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& B \times B
    &\stackrel{-}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the composite bottom morphism is $(f - g)$.
