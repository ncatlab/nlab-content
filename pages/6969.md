## Idea

_Intensional type theory_ is the flavor of [[type theory]] in which [[identity types]] are not necessarily [[propositions]] (that is, [[(-1)-truncated]]).  [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]]'s original definition of identity types, and the equivalent formulation as an [[inductive type]], are by default intensional; one has to impose extra axioms or rules in order to get [[extensional type theory]] (in which identity types are propositions).

In particular, [[homotopy type theory]] is intensional, because identity types represent [[path objects]].

Note that some type theorists use "intensional type theory" to refer to type theory which fails to satisfy [[function extensionality]].  This is in general an orthogonal requirement to how we are using the term here.

## Properties

### Decidability
 {#Decidability}

Only the intensional but not the [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] is [[decidability|decidable]]. ([Martin-Löf](#MartinLoef), [Hofmann](#Hofmann)).
