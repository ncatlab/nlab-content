## Idea

The version of [[type theory]] in which two terms $f, g$ of [[function types]] are _not_ necessarily identified if $\forall x : f(x) = g(x)$. Rather, the two functions may differ by _how_ they compute this result.

If this distinction is not made, one speaks of [[extensional type theory]].

## Properties

### Identity types

In particular two terms of a [[propositions as types|proposition type]] may give the same result ("[[true]]" or "[[false]]"), hence be [[proof]]s of the given proposition, but be _different_ proofs. This is implemented by the notion of [[identity types]] (as opposed to "equality types") in intensional type theory.

### Decidibility

Only the intensional but not the [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] is [[decidable]]. ([Martin-Löf](#MartinLoef), [Hofmann](#Hofmann)).
