## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[set]].  Frequently, $S$ is a [[group]] or [[monoid]] (usually commutative).

An **$S$-graded set** is an $S$-indexed [[family of sets]] $\{X_s\}_{s\in S}$.  This can equivalently be described as a function $S \to Set$, or as a function $X \to S$ (with $X_s$ the [[fiber]] over $s\in S$).

The elements of $X_s$ are often said to have **degree** $s$.


## Examples

The most common choices of $S$ are probably:

* the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$.
* the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$.
* the $2$-element set $\mathbb{Z}/2$.  In this case, the elements of degree $0$ are often called **even**, and those of degree $1$ **odd**.


## Monoidal structure and enrichment

Suppose $(S,0,+)$ is a monoid, written additively.  Then the category $Set^S$ of $S$-graded sets has a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]] structure, where

$$ (X \otimes Y)_s = \coprod_{u+v = s} (X_u \times Y_v) $$

This is a special case of [[Day convolution]].

A $Set^S$-[[enriched category]] is a category whose morphisms all have degrees in $S$, and such that identity morphisms have degree $0$ and $deg(g f) = deg(g) + deg(f)$.  Note that its underlying ordinary category, in the usual sense of enriched category theory, is the category of degree-$0$ morphisms.


## Graded objects

Given any set $S$ and any [[category]] $C$, the category of __$S$-graded objects of $C$__ is simply the [[functor category]] $C^S$ (identifying $S$ with its discrete category).  This includes graded sets as above, as well as [[graded abelian groups]], [[graded modules]], [[graded vector spaces]].  However, [[graded rings]] and [[graded algebras]] are not the same (and in particular require $S$ to be a [[monoid]]).
