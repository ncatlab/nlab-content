## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[set]].  Frequently, $S$ is a [[group]] or [[monoid]] (usually commutative).

An **$S$-graded set** is an $S$-indexed family of sets $\{X_s\}_{s\in S}$.  This can equivalently be described as a function $S\to Set$, or as a function $X\to S$ (with $X_s$ the fiber over $s\in S$).

The elements of $X_s$ are often said to have **degree** $s$.

## Examples

The most common choices of $S$ are probably:

* the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$.
* the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$.
* the 2-element set $\mathbb{Z}/2$.  In this case, the elements of degree 0 are often called **even**, and those of degree 1 **odd**.

## Monoidal structure and enrichment

Suppose $(S,0,+)$ is a monoid, written additively.  Then the category $Set^S$ of $S$-graded sets has a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]] structure, where

$$ (X \otimes Y)_s = \coprod_{u+v = s} (X_u \times Y_v) $$

This is a special case of [[Day convolution]].

A $Set^S$-[[enriched category]] is a category whose morphisms all have degrees in $S$, and such that identity morphisms have degree 0 and $deg(g f) = deg(g) + deg(f)$.  Note that its underlying ordinary category, in the usual sense of enriched category theory, is the category of degree-0 morphisms.
