Poisson manifolds are the mathematical setup for classical mechanics with finitely many degrees of freedom. 

A __Poisson algebra__ is a commutative unital [[associative algebra]] $A$ over the field of real or complex numbers equipped with a Lie bracket $\{,\}:A\otimes A\to A$ such that for any $f\in A$, $\{ f,-\}:A\to A$ is a derivation of $A$ as an associative algebra.

A __Poisson manifold__ is a real smooth [[manifold]] $M$ together with a Lie algebra bracket $\{,\}:C^\infty(M)\times C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M)$ on the vector space of smooth functions on $M$ which together with the pointwise multiplication of function makes it a Poisson algebra. As derivations of $C^\infty(M)$ correspond to smooth vector fields, for each $f\in C^\infty(M)$ there is a vector $X_f$ given by $X_f(g)=\{f,g\}$ and called the __Hamiltonian vector field__ corresponding to the function $f$ which is viewed as a classical hamiltonian function.  

Alternatively a Poisson structure on a manifold is given by a choice of smooth antisymmetric bivector called Poisson bivector $P\in\Lambda^2 TM$; then $\{f,g\}:=\lt df\otimes dg, P\gt$. 

Every [[symplectic manifold]] carries a natural Poisson structure; however such Poisson manifolds are very special. It is a basic theorem that Poisson structures on a manifold are equivalent to the smooth foliations of the underlying manifold, such that each leaf is a symplectic manifold.

The dual to a finite-dimensional Lie algebra has a natural structure of a Poisson manifold due Kirillov. Its leaves are called [[coadjoint orbit]]s. 

A morphism $h:M\to N$ of Poisson manifold is a morphism of smooth manifolds such that 
for all $f,g\in C^\infty(N)$, $\{f\circ h, g\circ h\}_M = \{f,g\}_N$.
