## Idea

Once _infinitesimal analysis_ was a synonym for "infinitesimal [[calculus]]", hence for the foundations of the theory of [[differentiation]] and [[integration]], but it has come to  refer to the formulation of [[analysis]] using explicit [[infinitesimal objects]], in contrast to [[epsilontic analysis]].

Formalisms that make infinitesimal analysis precise include

* [[synthetic differential geometry]] with [[nilpotent infinitesimals]]

* [[nonstandard analysis]] with non-nilpotent infinitesimals
