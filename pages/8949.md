Let $C$ be a category equipped with [[Grothendieck topology]] $\tau$, and $\pi:\mathcal{F}\to C$ a [[fibered category]] which is in fact a [[stack]] over the Grothendieck [[site]] $(C,\tau)$. Let $G$ be an [[group object]] in $C$ and $P$ a $G$-[[torsor]] in $C$ over $X\cong P/G$. 
Then the $G$-equivariant fiber over $P$ (i.e. the category $F^G(P)$ of $G$-[[equivariant object]]s over $P$ in the fibered category $\mathcal{F}$ over $C$) 
is equivalent to the usual fiber $\mathcal{F}(U)= \pi^{-1}(id_U)$ over $X$; this statement is referred to as the descent along the $G$-torsor $P$. 

In particular, the assignment of the category of quasicoherent sheaves to every scheme gives a pseudofunctor over the categroy of schemes with the faithfully flat topology. In the faithfully flat topology, for an algebraic group scheme $G$ and a $G$-torsor $P\to X$ in faithfully flat topology, the category of equivariant quasicoherent sheaves over $P$ is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves over $X$. 

Sometimes, the theorem on the descent along torsors is quite imprecisely referred to as the equivariant descent theorem.

An analogue in affine noncommutative algebraic geometry is the [[Schneider's descent theorem]] relating relative [[Hopf module]]s over the Hopf-Galois extension with the usual modules over the base. It has generalizations for other distributive laws, e.g. when the Hopf modules are replaced by [[entwined modules]]; also the generalization when
the Hopf algebras are replaced by weak Hopf algebras, Hopf algebroids and alike. There 
are also globalized (non-affine) versions using coaction [[compatible localization]]s.
