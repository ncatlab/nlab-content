The [[hidden smoothness principle]] refers to the conjectural picture envisioned in 1980s by [[Deligne]], [[Drinfeld]], [[Beilinson]], [[Kontsevich]] that [[moduli space]]s in algebraic geometry which are often singular, should be just truncations of a moduli spaces in some derived sense (precursors seen often at the level of [[derived categories of coherent sheaves]] and conjecturally these moduli spaces would locally involve [[commutative differential graded algebras]]); furthermore these moduli spaces should be smooth, and this property is lost due truncation. The derived moduli spaces were indeed realized in [[derived algebraic geometry]] and often indeed smoothness fails for truncation reasons. However, the smoothness is, even for the derived moduli spaces, not always present, hence the conjecture resulted in a heuristic rather than in a general rule.   

One of the principal concrete motivations was the idea to give the intrinsic geometric presentation and proof of the [[Serre intersection formula]].
