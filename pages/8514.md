The abc conjecture (written also ABC conjecture and Masser-Oesterlé conjecture) is a number theoretic conjecture posed by Joseph Oesterlé and David Masser in 1985. They looked at triples $a,b,c$ of relatively prime integers satisfying the equation $a+b+c = 0$ (or nowdays often instead $a + b = c$). They stratify the solution according to their "power". By radical $rad(N)$ of an integer $N$ one means the product of all its distinct prime factors. The _power_ of an abc-solution $(a,b,c)$ one denotes $P(a,b,c) = log|c|-log(rad(a\cdot b\cdot c))$. 

__abc conjecture__ For any number $\epsilon\gt 0$ there are only finitely many integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ to the abc equation with power $P(a,b,c)\geq\epsilon$.

[[Shinichi Mochizuki]] recently anounced the proof which community perceives as a serius but unchecked claim.

[Rumour, summer 2012](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/abc-conjecture-rumor-2/) - has the abc conjecture been proven by Mochizuki???

See this [review](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2310252) of a Soule article and the (paper) references it contains for stuff on the Arakelov theory approach to the abc conj via the Bogomolov inequality, and possible solution to the problem of absent absolute differentials. I have the article itself. The notion of successive minima might also be relevant - he mentioned some unpublished preprint with errors from the 90s or so.
