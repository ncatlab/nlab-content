## Idea

The _abc conjecture_ (or _ABC conjecture_) is a [[number theory|number theoretic]] conjecture due to ([Oesterlé-Masser 1985](#OesterléMasser)), which says that there are only [[finite set|finitely many]] integer solutions to the [[equation]] 

$$
  a + b = c   \;\;\; for a,b,c \geq 1 \in \mathbb{N}
$$

(or instead $a+b+c= 0$)
if one requires the [[integer numbers]] $a,b,c$ to have no common factor as well as having "joint power" greater than a given bound.

Here the _power_ of $a,b,c$ is

$$
  P(a,b,c) \coloneqq \frac{log|c|}{log(rad(a\cdot b\cdot c))}
  \,,
$$

where the [[radical]] $rad(n)$ of an [[integer]] $n$ is the product of all its distinct [[prime factors]]. 

The precise form of the conjecture is:

###### Conjecture
**(abc conjecture)**

For any number $\epsilon\gt 0$ there are only finitely many positive relatively prime ([[coprime integers|coprime]]) [[integer]] solutions $(a,b,c)$ to the [[equation]] $a + b = c$   with power $P(a,b,c)\geq 1+\epsilon$.

According to ([Mazur](#Matzur)):

> The beauty of such a Conjecture is that it captures the intuitive sense that triples of numbers which satisfy a linear relation, and which are divisible by high perfect powers, are rare; the precision of the Conjecture goads one to investigate this rarity quantitatively. Its very statement makes an attractive appeal to perform a range of numerical experiments that would test the empirical waters. On a theoretical level, it is enlightening to understand its relationship to the constellation of standard arithmetic theorems, conjectures, questions, etc., and we shall give some indications of this below.

## Mason's Theorem 

According to [Lang](#Lang), one important antecedent of the abc conjecture is a simple but at the time unexpected relation for the function field case, published in 1984. Consider polynomials $f \in k[t]$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, and define $n_0(f)$ to be the number of _distinct_ roots of $f$, counted _without_ regard to multiplicity.

###### Theorem ([Mason](#Mason)) 
Let $a, b, c \in k[t]$ be relatively prime polynomials, not all constant, such that $a + b = c$. Then $\max \{deg(a), deg(b), deg(c)\} \leq n_0(a b c) - 1$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $f = a/c$, $g = b/c$, so that $f + g = 1$. Taking the derivative, we obtain 

$$\frac{f'}{f} f + \frac{g'}{g} g = 0$$ 

whence 

$$b/a = g/f = -\frac{f'/f}{g'/g}.$$ 

Put 

$$a(t) = c_1 \prod (t - \alpha_i)^{m_i}, \qquad b(t) = c_2 \prod (t - \beta_j)^{n_j}, \qquad c(t) = c_3 \prod (t - \gamma_k)^{p_k}.$$ 

Then 

$$\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{f'/f}{g'/g} = -\frac{\sum \frac{m_i}{t - \alpha_i} - \sum \frac{p_k}{t - \gamma_k}}{\sum \frac{n_j}{t - \beta_j} - \sum \frac{p_k}{t - \gamma_k}} .$$

A common denominator for $f'/f$ and $g'/g$ is given by 

$$N_0 = \prod (t - \alpha_i) \prod (t - \beta_j) \prod (t - \gamma_k)$$ 

whose degree is $n_0(a b c)$. We then have 

$$\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{N_0 f'/f}{N_0 g'/g}$$ 

where the numerator and denominator on the right are polynomials. However, since $b$ and $a$ are relatively prime, the fraction $b/a$ is already in lowest terms. From this we conclude that $deg(b) \leq deg(N_0 f'/f) \leq n_0(a b c) - 1$, and similarly $deg(a) \leq deg(N_0 g'/g) \leq n_0(a b c) - 1$, which completes the proof.

###### Corollary (FLT for polynomials) 
Assume $x, y, z \in k[t]$ are relatively prime polynomials, not all constant, and suppose $x^n + y^n = z^n$. Then $n \leq 2$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
From Mason's theorem, we conclude $n deg(x) = deg(x^n) \leq deg(x) + deg(y) + deg(z) - 1$, and similarly upon replacing $x$ by $y$ and $z$ on the left. Adding the results, we have 

$$n(deg(x) + deg(y) + deg(z)) \leq 3(deg(x) + deg(y) + deg(z)) - 3$$ 

which is impossible if $n \geq 3$.

Guided by analogies between the ring of integers and the ring of polynomials in one variable, and building on insights of Mason, Frey, Szpiro, and others, Masser and Oesterl&eacute; were led to formulate the abc conjecture for integers as follows. Again define $N_0(m)$ for $m$ a non-zero integer to be the number of distinct primes dividing $m$. 

* Conjecture: For all $\epsilon \lt 0$ there exists $C(\epsilon) \lt 0$ such that for relatively prime integers $a, b, c$ satisfying $a + b = c$, we have 
$$\max({|a|}, {|b|}, {|c|}) \leq C(\epsilon)N_0(a b c)^{1+\epsilon}.$$ 

Of course, this differs from the polynomial case because of the presence of $1+ \epsilon$ in the exponent, but this is a necessary evil. For example, for any $C \gt 0$, we can find relatively prime $a$, $b$, $c$ with $a + b = c$ and ${|a|} \gt C N_0(a b c)$: take $a = 3^{2^n}$, $b = -1$, and observe by repeated application of $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$ that $c = a + b$ is of the form $2^n d$ for some integer $d$. Taking $n$ sufficiently large, we can easily derive the claimed inequality. 



## Relation to other statements

The abc conjecture implies the [[Mordell conjecture]] ([Elkies](#Elkies)).

It is equivalent to the general form of [[Szpiro's conjecture]].
