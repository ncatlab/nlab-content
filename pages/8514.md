The abc conjecture (written also ABC conjecture and Masser-Oesterlé conjecture) is a number theoretic conjecture posed by Joseph Oesterlé and David Masser in 1985. They looked at triples $a,b,c$ of relatively prime integers satisfying the equation $a+b+c = 0$ (or nowdays often instead $a + b = c$). They stratify the solution according to their "power". By radical $rad(N)$ of an integer $N$ one means the product of all its distinct prime factors. The _power_ of an abc-solution $(a,b,c)$ one denotes $P(a,b,c) = log|c|/log(rad(a\cdot b\cdot c))$. 

__abc conjecture__ For any number $\epsilon\gt 0$ there are only finitely many integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ to the abc equation with power $P(a,b,c)\geq\epsilon$.
