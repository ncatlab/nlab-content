## Idea

A _restricted product_ $\prod^\prime_{s\in S} X_s$ indexed by a [[set]] $S$ is the [[subobject]] of the genuine [[product]] on those elements  which are "trivial" for all but a [[finite number]] of indices $s\in S$.

Here what "trivial" means depends on the context. Often the $X_s$ are [[groups]] with specified [[subgroups]] $K_s \subset X_s$ and "is trivial" is taken to be "is in $K_s$". If $K_s$ is the [[trivial group]] then "is trivial" means "is the neutral element".


## Examples

* The [[ring of adeles]] of a [[global field]] $k$ is the restricted product of the [[formal completions]] $k_v$ at all its [[places]] $v$, with the restriction being that only finitely many components have [[norm]] greater than unity.

* A [[weak direct product]] is a restricted product whose trivial subobjects are specified [[global elements]].
