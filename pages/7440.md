## Idea

The notion of _[[(∞,1)-category]]_ may be formulated [[internalization|internal]] to any other $(\infty,1)$-category with sufficient propoerties (with a rich enough [[internal logic]]). This generalizes the notion of _[[internal category]]_ from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category theory]].

## Idea 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]].

A general abstract way of defining an $(\infty,1)$-category $A$ _internal to_ $\mathcal{C}$ -- also called a _$(\infty,1)$-category object_ in $\mathcal{C}$ is to say that this is a [[simplicial object]] $A : \Delta^{op} \to \mathcal{C}$. The condition that the object $A_k$ in degree $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is to be thought of as the _object of sequences of composable morphisms of length $k$_ of $A$ is formalized by asking the canonical morphisms $A_k \to A_1 \times_{A_0} \cdots \times_{A_0} A_1$ (into the iterated [[(∞,1)-pullback]] over the [[source]] and [[target maps]]) to be an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence in]] $\mathcal{C}$. In fact, this is literally just the definition of an [[internal category]] but interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$. Accordingly one may just as well equivalently speak just of a category object_ in $\mathcal{C}$.

Indeed, the obvious strengthening of this definition to enforce invertibility of [[morphisms]] yields the notion of [[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category]], which could also be called an _[[internal ∞-groupoid]]_.

Therefore, a further condition is necessary to ensure that the notion of [[homotopy]] in $\mathcal{C}$ is compatible with that in $A$ (this is caled the "completeness condition", see [below](#Completeness)).

A general abstract [[(∞,1)-category theory|(∞,1)-category theoretic]] way of formalizing this is given in [Lurie, sections 1.1, 1.2](#Lurie). For historical reasons, the notion of _internal $(\infty,1)$-category_ there goes by the name _complete Segal space object_, in honor of the notion of a _[[complete Segal space]]_, which may be thought of as perceiving an ordinary [[(∞,1)-category]] as an internal $(\infty,1)$-category in $\mathcal{C} = $ [[∞Grpd]].

There are a variety of [[model category]] structures that [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|present]] the $(\infty,1)$-category of all internal $(\infty,1)$-categories in a suitable $\mathcal{C}$, which typically go as models for _complete Segal space objects_. The soundness of these models is discussed in [Lurie, section 1.5](#Lurie).

### $(\infty,n)$-category

Let $\mathcal{C} := Cat_{(\infty,1]}$ be the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]]. Then the $(\infty,1)$-category $Cat_{(\infty,1)}(\mathcal{C})$ of $(\infty,1)$-category objects in $\mathcal{C}$ is, up to [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalence]], the $(\infty,1)$-category of [[(∞,2)-categories]]

$$
  Cat_{(\infty,1)}(Cat_{(\infty,1)})
  \simeq
  Cat_{(\infty,2)}
  \,.
$$

This yields an inductive construction of [[(∞,n)Cat]], the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[(∞,n)-categories]]

$$
  Cat_{(\infty,1)}(Cat_{(\infty,1)}(\cdots (Cat_{(\infty,1)})))
  \simeq
  Cat_{(\infty,n)}
  \,.
$$

The corresponging model is that of _[[n-fold complete Segal space]]_.
