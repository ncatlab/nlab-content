For a [[small category]] $S$, just as the [[presheaf]] category $Set^{S^{op}}$ is the [[free cocompletion]] of $S$, by duality we can conclude that $(Set^S)^{op}$ is the **free completion** of $S$.  This means that any functor $S\to C$ where $C$ is [[complete category|complete]] factors uniquely (up to isomorphism) through the "dual Yoneda embedding" $S\to (Set^S)^{op}$ via a [[continuous functor]] $(Set^S)^{op}\to C$.

This operation is a [[2-monad]] which is [[lax idempotent 2-monad|lax idempotent]] but not (even weakly) [[idempotent monad|idempotent]].  In analogy with the general concept of [[completion]], we might call the operation of *any* lax idempotent monad on a $2$-category a 'free completion'.  See discussion at [[completion]].
