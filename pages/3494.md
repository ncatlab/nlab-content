###Idea###
First a vague version:

A homotopy coherent diagram is a diagram of objects in a category which has a notion of homotopy, where commutativity is replaced by explicit homotopies, those homotopies are to then be coherently linked by higher homotopies ... and so on.

The idea perhaps intuitively makes sense but the management of the interactions between the various levels of homotopy requires care. The ideas were handled in various ways , but we will concentrate on approaches linked to the initial work of [[Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer Vogt]] and then developed further by [[Jean-Marc Cordier]] and [[Tim Porter]].
