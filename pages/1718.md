In a [[partial order|poset]] or even [[preorder|proset]], the __up set__ of an element $x$ is the set
$$ x{\uparrow} = \{ y \;|\; x \leq y \} .$$

In a [[quasiorder]], the __strict up set__ of $x$ is the set
$$ x\dot{\uparrow} = \{ y \;|\; x \lt y \} .$$

If you think of a poset $P$ as a [[category]], then the up set of $x$ is the [[slice category]] $P / x$.

An up set in the [[opposite category|opposite]] $P^{op}$ of $P$ is a [[down set]] in $P$.

Note: The term 'up set' is also often used for an [[upper set]], a more general concept.  In the terminology above, the up set of $x$ is the upper set [[Moore closure|generated by]] $x$.
