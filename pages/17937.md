## Idea

A fundamental theorem of [[topology]]: for $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ two different natural numbers, $n_1 \neq n_2$, then the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ of [[dimension]] $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively, are _not_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (while for $n_1 = n_2$ then of course they are). Hence [[dimension]] of [[topological manifolds]] is a _topological [[invariant]]_.

This seems intuitively obvious, but the [[formal proof]] (due to [[Brouwer]] around 1910) is comparatively hard, and the problem was an important open problem in the 19th century. To appreciate that the problem is harder than it may superficially seem it serves to notice that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are [[surjective]] [[continuous maps]] $\mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ (the [[Peano curves]]), in addition to the obvious [[injective]] continuous maps $\mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 1$ (or indeed $\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ for $m \leq n$), because of which there are also [[bijective]] (but discontinuous) maps $\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ for $m, n \geq 1$ (by the [[Schroeder–Bernstein theorem]]).


## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem #InvarianceOfDomain}
###### Theorem
**(Brouwer invariance of domain theorem)**

For $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ an [[open subset]] of a [[Cartesian space]], for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and for $f \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[injective map]], then its [[image]] $f(U)$ is also an [[open subset]].

In other words, continuous injections between Cartesian spaces are [[open maps]].  

=--

This is proven with tools from [[algebraic topology]], notably with the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

+-- {: .num_lemma #LemmaForTheCorollary}
###### Lemma

For $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[injection]] from $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ if and only if $n_1 \leq n_2$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $n_1 \leq n_2$, use $\iota_{n_1,n_2}\colon (x_1, \ldots, x_{n_1}) \mapsto (x_1, \ldots, x_{n_1}, \vec{0})$, where $\vec{0}$ consists of $n_2 - n_1$ copies of $0$.  If $n_1 \gt n_2$, then supposing a continuous injection $f\colon \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$, compose $f$ with $\iota_{n_2,n_1}$ to get a map from $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ to itself, also a continuous injection.  By invariance of domain (theorem \ref{InvarianceOfDomain}), the [[image]] of this map is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$, yet contained in the range of $\iota_{n_2,n_1}$, and the only open subset of that range is [[empty subset|empty]], a contradiction since $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ is not empty.

###### Corollary
**(topological invariance of dimension)**

For $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ then the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] if and only if $n_1 = n_2$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A homeomorphism is a continuous injection both ways, so $n_1 \leq n_2$ and $n_2 \leq n_1$ by lemma \ref{LemmaForTheCorollary}.

=--

This only-if half of this argument immediately generalizes to any [[inhabited subset|inhabited]] open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$.
