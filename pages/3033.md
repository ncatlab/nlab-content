# contact {#contact} 

The best way to contact me is by sending me an email at <fiorenza@mat.uniroma1.it>


# my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in [[mathematics|math]] from the University of Pisa. Have been a postdoc in mathematics for three years (in Roma Tor Vergata and Sapienza). Since 2005 I am assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.mat.uniroma1.it">Sapienza - Universit\`a di Roma</a>

# my research {#myresearch}

I'm principally interested in categorical constructions arising from theoretical [[physics]]. Something like a personal research wiki with more information is beginning to develop at

* [my personal web within the nLab] (I have to ask for this).

My **research interest**: detalis to be added



# exchange of thoughts {#exchangeofthoughts}

I enjoy exchanging thoughts on topics of interest for my research and always felt it would be a pity not to use the web for that purpose. To satisfy that need I use to 

* work on the wiki [The nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) (this wiki here).

* [my personal web within the nLab] (still missing).
