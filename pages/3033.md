# contact {#contact} 

The best way to contact me is by sending me an email at <fiorenza@mat.uniroma1.it>


# my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in [[mathematics|math]] from the University of Pisa. Have been a postdoc in mathematics for three years (in Roma Tor Vergata and Sapienza). Since 2005 I am assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.mat.uniroma1.it">Sapienza - Universit√† di Roma</a>

# my research {#myresearch}

I'm principally interested in categorical constructions arising from theoretical [[physics]]. Something like a personal research wiki with more information is beginning to develop at

* [[domenicofiorenza:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]].

My **research interest**: detalis to be added



# exchange of thoughts {#exchangeofthoughts}

I enjoy exchanging thoughts on topics of interest for my research and always felt it would be a pity not to use the web for that purpose. To satisfy that need I use to work on

*  the wiki [The nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) (this wiki here).

* [[domenicofiorenza:HomePage|my personal web within the nLab]]

# beta versions {#betaversions}

Here is where I develop revisions of nLab entries which (from my point of view) deserve consistent revision. As revision is complte I'll post them on the nLab. Everithing you find here is work in progress: please, edit it!

Currently revising:

* [[domenicofiorenza:over quasi-category|over quasi-category]]

* [[domenicofiorenza:limit|limit]]
