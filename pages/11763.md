## Idea


The principle of _identity of indiscernibles_ states that two objects are [[identical]] if they have all the same [[properties]].

This is also known as "[[Leibniz]]'s Law"


"There are several ways to think about the axiom of [[univalence]]. One can see it as a sophisticated updating of Leibniz’s principle of the identity of indiscernibles." --[[John Baez]] [nCafé](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/11/categories_for_the_working_phi.html)

A topological or geometrical version of the idea of identity of indiscernibles is [[separation axioms|separation]]: if two points are distinct, then they are separated in some sense. This means in turn that if two points in a space subject to a given separation axiom can not be separated by any admissible separation condition then they are identical.
