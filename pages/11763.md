"There are several ways to think about the axiom of univalence. One can see it as a sophisticated updating of Leibnizâ€™s principle of the identity of indiscernibles." --John Baez [http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/11/categories_for_the_working_phi.html](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/11/categories_for_the_working_phi.html)
