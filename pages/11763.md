## Idea

The principle of _identity of indiscernibles_ states that two objects are [[identical]] if they have all the same [[properties]].

This is also known as "[[Leibniz]]'s Law" (not to be confused with the [[product rule]], also so-called).

According to [Gries & Schneider 1998](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/7340), Leibniz wrote the following, in translation:

> Two terms are the same if one can be substituted for the otherwithout altering the truth of any statement. If we have $P$ and $Q$, and $P$ enters into some true proposition, and the substitution of $Q$ for $P$ wherever it appears results in a new proposition that is likewise true, and if this can be done for every proposition, then $P$ and $Q$ are said to be the same; 

> conversely, if $P$ and $Q$ are the same, they can be substituted for one another.



## In homotopy type theory
 {#InHomotopyTypeTheory}

In the presence of an [[identity type]], identity of indiscernibles is trivial because of [[haecceity|haecceities]]; but extensionality principles like [[function extensionality]], [[propositional extensionality]], and [[univalence]] ("typal extensionality") are naturally regarded as a stronger form of identity of indiscernibles. In particular, the [[consistency]] of [[univalence]] means that in [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] without univalence, one cannot define any [[predicate]] that provably distinguishes isomorphic [[types]]; thus isomorphic types are "externally indiscernible", and univalence incarnates that principle internally by making them identical.


"There are several ways to think about the axiom of [[univalence]]. One can see it as a sophisticated updating of Leibniz's principle of the identity of indiscernibles." --[[John Baez]] [nCaf&#233;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/11/categories_for_the_working_phi.html)


## In topology

A [[topology|topological]] or geometrical version of the idea of identity of indiscernibles is [[separation axioms|separation]]: if two points are distinct, then they are separated in some sense. This means in turn that if two points in a space subject to a given separation axiom can not be separated by any admissible separation condition then they are identical.
