## Idea

Semantics is the interpretation of the [[syntax]] of a [[theory]] in a [[model]].

## Examples

### Categorical semantics of dependent type theory

Notably the [[semantics]] of [[type theories]] is given by [[categories]]. For instance 

* [[dependent type theory]] is precisely the formal language for which [[locally cartesian closed categories]] are the semantics, 

* [[intensional type theory]]is the formal language for which [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-categories]] are the semantics;

* [[homotopy type theory]] is the formal language for which [[elementary (infinity,1)-toposes]] are the semantics.

For more on this see at _[[categorical semantics]]_ and at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_.
