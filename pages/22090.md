## Idea


The _[[Pontryagin theorem]]_ ([Pontryagin 38a](#Pontryagin38a), [50](#Pontryagin50), [55 II.6](#Pontryagin55)) identifies, for a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[smooth manifold]] $M^d$

* the [[cobordism classes]] of [[normally framed submanifolds|normally framed]] [[closed manifold|closed]] [[submanifolds]] of [[codimension]] $n$  in $M^d$

with 

* the $n$-[[Cohomotopy]] of $M^d$ -- the [[homotopy classes]] of [[maps]] from $M^d$ into the [[n-sphere]];

* the _[[Cohomotopy charge map]]_, often known as the _[[Pontryagin-Thom collapse construction]]_, which sends a [[normally framed submanifold]] $\Sigma^{d-n} \subset M^d$ to the [[continuous function]] taking values in the [[one-point compactification]] $\big( \mathbb{R}^n \big)^{cpt} \simeq S^n$ that assigns to points in $M^d$ sufficiently close to $\Sigma$ their "directed distance" from $\Sigma$, namely their [[normal vector]], and regards all other points as being "[[vanishing at infinity|at infinity]]":

In this form, with the assumption that $M^d$ is [[closed manifold|closed]], hence [[compact topological space|compact]], the statement appears for instance in [Kosinski 93, Sec. IX Prop. 5.5](#Kosinski93).

More generally, if the [[smooth manifold]] $M^d$ is not assumed to be [[compact topological space|compact]], essentially the same [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]] still gives an identification of the [[cobordism classes]] of its [[normally framed submanifolds]] with the _[reduced Cohomotopy](cohomotopy#ReducedCohomotopy)_ of its [[one-point compactification]]:

This form of Pontryagin's theorem seems to be [[folklore]] (e.g. [here](https://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/129511/FCM_THESIS.pdf#page=8)). It is made fully explicit in [CsÃ©pai 20, p. 12-13](#Csepai20).

An analogous statement, identifying [[cobordism classes]] of [[normally oriented submanifolds]] with [[homotopy classes]] of maps into the [[universal vector bundle|universal]] [[special orthogonal group|special orthogonal]] [[Thom space]] $M SO(n)$, is _[[Thom's theorem]]_ ([Thom 54](#Thom54)):

(Now the notion of asymptotic directed distance depends on the [[normal bundle|normal tangent spaces]], along $\Sigma$, which themselves vary now in the [[Grassmannian]] $Gr_n$, hence in the [[classifying space]] $B SO(n) \subset M SO(n)$.)


Both statements, Pontryagin's and Thom's, as well as their joint generalization to other [[tangential structures]] (besides framing and orientation structure) and notably their [[stabilization]] to [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology theory|Whitehead-generalized]] [[Cobordism cohomology theory]], have all come to be widely known as _the [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]]_, or similar, a term commonly used also for rather more involved cases, such as in [[MUFr]]-theory. This type of construction constitutes the basis of modern [[cobordism theory]] and its application in [[stable homotopy theory]].
