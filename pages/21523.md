## Idea

The _Tate sphere_, in the strict sense, is the [[object]] in a [[sheaf topos]] (or [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]], or its [[stabilization]]) over a [[gros site]] of [[algebraic varieties]], which is given by

$$ 
  S^1_{Tate}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbb{A}^1 / (\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\})
  \,.
$$

This denotes the ([[homotopy cofiber|homotopy]]-)[[cofiber]] of the inclusion morphism into the [[sheaf]] [[representable functor|represented]] by the [[affine line]] $\mathbb{A}^1$ from the [[subobject]] $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}$ [[representable functor|represented]] by the affine line with origin removed. The latter is equivalently the object underlying the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathbb{G}_m$.

This construction is typically understood by default in the context of [[motivic homotopy theory]] working over the [[Nisnevich site]] ([VRO 07, Remark 2.22](#VRO07)).
But the construction principle is clearly more general.

The Tate sphere gives rise to [[Tate twist|Tate twists]] in [[Weil cohomology theory|Weil cohomology theories]] such as [[étale cohomology]]. In formal constructions of categories of [[motive|motives]], one typically needs to 'invert the Tate sphere' in some sense in order to capture/represent Tate twists correctly. This is the case both for the [[stable motivic homotopy category|stable motivic homotopy categories]] à la [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]], where one more precisely inverts the operation of smashing with the Tate sphere, and for the category of [[pure motive|pure motives]], where one inverts the [[Lefschetz motive]].
