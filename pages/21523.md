## Idea

The _Tate sphere_, in the strict sense, is the [[object]] in a [[sheaf topos]] (or [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]], or its [[stabilization]]) over a [[gros site]] of [[algebraic varieties]], which is one of the following: $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ (the [[projective line]]); the quotient

$$ 
  S^1_{Tate}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbb{A}^1 / (\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\})
  \,,
$$

which denotes the ([[homotopy cofiber|homotopy]]-)[[cofiber]] of the inclusion morphism into the [[sheaf]] [[representable functor|represented]] by the [[affine line]] $\mathbb{A}^1$ from the [[subobject]] $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}$ [[representable functor|represented]] by the affine line with origin removed (equivalently the object underlying the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathbb{G}_m$); or $S^{1} \wedge \mathbb{G}_{m}$.

These constructions are understood by default in the context of [[motivic homotopy theory]] working over the [[Nisnevich site]] ([VRO 07, Remark 2.22](#VRO07)), where they are all $\mathbb{A}^{1}$-homotopy equivalent.
But the construction principle, especially that of the homotopy cofibre definition, is clearly more general.

In formal constructions of categories of [[motive|motives]], one typically 'inverts the Tate sphere' in some sense in order to represent [[Tate twist|Tate twists]] correctly in [[Weil cohomology theory|Weil cohomology theories]] such as [[étale cohomology]], or in [[motivic cohomology|motivic cohomology theories]]. This is the case, for example, both for the [[stable motivic homotopy category|stable motivic homotopy categories]] à la [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]], where one more precisely inverts the operation of smashing with the Tate sphere, and for the category of [[pure motive|pure motives]], where one inverts the [[Lefschetz motive]].
