
## Idea

For any category $S$ with pullbacks, it is easy to define the notion of [[internal category|category]] in $S$, and the definition of an internal [[functor]] between such is similarly straightforward.  But it is not so obvious how to define [[presheaf|presheaves]] on internal categories, because they must land in the ambient category $S$.

The solution lies in thinking of presheaves on an ordinary category $C$, and more generally [[profunctor]]s $C &#x21f8; D$, as giving sets equipped with an _action_ of the arrows of $C,D$, i.e. as their [[category of elements|categories of elements]].

## Definition

Here is the slick definition: let $S$ be a category with pullbacks. Then the bicategory $Prof(S)$ of internal categories, profunctors and transformations in $S$ is defined to be $Mod(Span(S))$, the category of [[monad]]s and [[module over a monad|bimodules]] in $Span(S)$, the [[bicategory]] of [[span]]s in $S$.

### Details

Recall that an [[internal category]] $C$ in $S$ is a monad in $Span(S)$, and so has an underlying span $(s,t) : C_1 \rightrightarrows C_0$.  Given $C,D \in Cat(S)$, a bimodule $H : C &#x21f8; D$ must be given by a span $H : C_0 \leftarrow H \to D_0$, together with a right action $H \circ C \to H$ of $C$ and a left action $D \circ H \to H$ of $D$ that are compatible in the sense described at [[module over a monad]].

Composition of spans is given by pullback, so the action of $C$ on $H$ is given by a morphism of spans $H_r : C_1 \times_{C_0} H \to H$, where the pullback is
$$
\array{
C_1 \times_{C_0} H & \to & H \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
C_1 & \underset{t}{\to} & C_0
}
$$
To say that $H_r$ is a morphism of spans is to require that
$$
\array{
C_1 \times_{C_0} H & \to & H \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
C_1 & \underset{s}{\to} & C_0
}
$$
commutes.  This action must satisfy unit and associativity axioms expressing functoriality of the corresponding presheaf.  Similarly, $H_\ell : H \times_{D_0} D_1 \to H$, where the pullback is along $s$, so that this represents a copresheaf.  Finally, compatibility of the two actions represents bifunctoriality of the profunctor.

An **internal presheaf** on an internal category is just a right action as above.

## Internal diagrams

An internal presheaf as above may take values in any [[Grothendieck fibration]] over $S$.  Given a fibration in the guise of an [[indexed category]] $E : S^{op} \to Cat$, a **$C$-diagram in $E$** is given by

* an object $P \in E(C_0)$, together with
* a morphism $\phi : s^* P \to t^* P$ in $E(C_1)$

satisfying 'cocycle equations'

* $i^*\phi = 1_P$
* $c^*\phi = p_1^* \phi \circ p_2^* \phi$

modulo coherent isos, where the $p_i$ are the projections out of $C_2$.

+-- {.query}
[[Finn Lawler|Finn]]:  Is there a slicker way to define these, or the category of them?  Anyone know a good reference?

[[Mike Shulman]]: One alternate definition is as an indexed functor from (the indexed category represented by) $C$ to $E$.  Maybe that's slicker?

[[Finn Lawler|Finn]]:  Yes, that's much nicer.  Embarassingly, I had to stare at this for quite a while before I realized that it should be just a simple application of Yoneda.  (D'oh!)  But I'm still stuck on the general case, so the paragraph below treats the strict case only.  There must be an elegant way to prove this for a pseudofunctor $E$, but at the moment I'm lost in a maze of twisty little Yoneda lemmas, all different.
=--

If $E$ is a strict functor, then it determines an internal category $E \in Cat([S^{op},Set])$, and because representables preserve limits $S(-,C_0)$ and $S(-,C_1)$ determine a 'representable' internal category $S(-,C) \in Cat([S^{op},Set])$.  Then an object $P \in E(C_0)$ is equivalent, by the [[Yoneda lemma]], to a natural transformation $F_0 : S(-,C_0) \to E_0$, and similarly $\phi$ determines $F_1 : S(-,C_1) \to E_1$.  It is easy to check that the (strict versions of the) conditions above are equivalent, again by Yoneda, to those making the $F_i$ into the components of an [[functor|internal functor]] $F : S(-,C) \to E$, equivalently a strict indexed functor $S(-,C) \to E$.

### Examples

* An internal presheaf on $C$ in the sense above is a $C^{op}$-diagram in the [[codomain fibration]] of $S$, that is the pseudofunctor $X \mapsto S/X$.

* If $S$ is equipped with a [[coverage]] and $C$ is the [[Cech nerve]] associated to a cover $p : U \to X$ in $S$, then the category of $C$-diagrams in $E$ is the [[descent]] category $Des_p(E)$.
