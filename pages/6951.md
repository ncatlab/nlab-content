## Idea

**Kripke-Joyal semantics** is a higher order generalization of the [[semantics|semantic]] interpretation proposed initially by Beth, Gregorczyk, and Kripke for [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic predicate logic]]. It provides a notion of _'local truth'_ or _'validity at a stage'_ in a [[topos]].

Since it is closely related to [[Paul Cohen|Paul Cohen's]] [[forcing]] technique in [[set theory]], a connection that was already observed by Gregorczyk and Kripke, it is sometimes called _forcing_ semantics. Other terms in use for it are _external_ semantics , _cover_ semantics or _Beth-Kripke-Joyal_ semantics.

By giving a semantics to formulas written in the [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] [[type theory]] used to express [[ordinary mathematics]] in a topos, the Kripke-Joyal semantics serves as [[semantics|semantic]] interface between the [[internalisation|internal (syntactic) description]] of mathematical objects using the [[Mitchell–Bénabou language]] and the external description.  

Kripke-Joyal semantics provide rules and prescriptions for semantic interpretation for general toposes but these prescriptions may simplify for special classes of toposes e.g. the rules resulting for [[presheaf toposes]] over posets (when restricted to first-order formulas) correspond to the original notion of model for IPL considered by [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]] et al.

There should be a version of Kripke-Joyal semantics for [[homotopy type theory]], as claimed [here](n-types%20cover#in_models). 

## Formulation

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an [[elementary topos]]. We will now specify the Kripke-Joyal semantics for formulas $\varphi$ in the [[Mitchell-Bénabou language]] of $\mathcal{E}$ restricting ourselves mainly to formulas $\varphi (x)$ with one free variable $x$ of type $X$. The straight forward generalization to the case with (less or) more free variables can be found in Johnstone ([1977](JT77)) or Borceux ([1994](#Borceux94)).

Recall that such a formula $\varphi (x)$ is interpreted by a morphism $X\overset{\varphi(x)}{\to}\Omega$ and gets an extension $\{x|\varphi(x)\}$ assigned to by the pullback

$$
\array{
\{x|\varphi(x)\}&\to & 1& \\
\downarrow &  &\downarrow &\mathsf{true} \\
X &\underset{\varphi(x)}{\to} & \Omega&
}
$$

Now a global element $1\overset{x_0}{\to} X$ satisfies $\varphi(x)$ if it is contained in $\{x|\varphi(x)\}$ in the sense that the following commutes:

$$
\array{
& &\{x|\varphi(x)\}&\to & 1 &\\
 &\nearrow&\downarrow &  &\downarrow &\mathsf{true} \\
1&\underset{x_0}{\to}& X &\underset{\varphi(x)}{\to} & \Omega&
}
$$

Kripke-Joyal semantics results from the generalization of this satisfaction relation from global elements to _generalized_ elements $U\overset{\alpha}{\to} X$.

+-- {: .num_defn #forcing}
###### Definition
A generalized element $U\overset{\alpha}{\to} X$ is said to _satisfy the formula_ $\varphi(x)$ or more suggestively, $U$ _forces_ $\varphi$ , denoted $U\models \varphi (\alpha)$ , when $\alpha$ factors through $\{x|\varphi(x)\}$ i.e. there exists a map $m$ making the following commute:
$$
\array{
& &\{x|\varphi(x)\}&\to & 1& \\
 &\overset{m}\nearrow&\downarrow &  &\downarrow &\mathsf{true} \\
U&\overset{\alpha}{\to}& X &\underset{\varphi(x)}{\to} & \Omega&
}
$$
=--

This is the same as to say that $im\,\alpha\subseteq \{x|\varphi(x)\}$ as subobjects of $X$.

Whereas $\{x|\varphi(x)\}$ represents the set of elements satifying $\varphi$ internally, the collection of global elements has in general no such representation thereby motivating the terminology 'external semantics'.

## Properties

One can now unwind the forcing relation $U\models \varphi (\alpha)$ recursively over the syntactic composition of $\varphi$. This results in a collection of semantic rules that is commonly referred to as the _Kripke-Joyal semantics_ and permits to make contact with the original rules proposed by Kripke for intuitionistic logic in 1965.

These rules are often useful for translating step by step an object defined by a formula of the Mitchell-B&#233;nabou into a concrete mathematical object in the topos.

First of all, the forcing relation is _monotone_ and _local_ :

+-- {: .num_prop #Monotone_Local}
###### Proposition
If $f:V\to U$ and $U\models \varphi (\alpha)$ then $V\models \varphi (\alpha\circ f)$. Conservely, if $f:V\to U$ is _epic_ and $V\models \varphi (\alpha\circ f)$ then $U\models \varphi (\alpha)$.

The short proof can be found in MacLane-Moerdijk ([1994](#MM94), p.304).

Note that the proposition gives a first hint of the importance of epimorphisms or _covers_ in this semantics, testimony of its geometric underpinning.

###### Theorem
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an elementary topos and $\alpha:U\to X\,$ a generalized element of $X\in\mathcal{E}$ . The forcing relation $\models$ satisfies

1. $U\models \varphi(\alpha)\wedge \psi(\alpha)$ iff $U\models \varphi(\alpha)$ and $U\models \psi(\alpha)\,$.

1. $U\models \varphi(\alpha)\vee \psi(\alpha)$ iff there exists maps $g:U_1\to U$ and $g_2:U_2\to U$ with $g_1+g_2:U_1+U_2\to U$ epic and such that $U_1\models \varphi(\alpha\circ g_1)$ and $U_2\models \psi(\alpha\circ g_2)\,$.

1. $U\models \varphi(\alpha)\Rightarrow \psi(\alpha)$ iff for any $g:V\to U\,$, $V\models \varphi(\alpha\circ g)$ implies $V\models\psi(\alpha\circ g)\,$.

1. $U\models\neg \varphi(\alpha)$ iff for all $g:V\to U\,$, $V\models \varphi(\alpha\circ g)$ implies that $V\simeq 0$.

Let $\varphi(x,y)$ be a formula with free variables x,y of type $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Then

1. $U\models \exists y\varphi(\alpha, y)$ iff there exists $g:V\to U$ epic and a generalized element $h:V\to Y$ such that $V\models \varphi(\alpha\circ g,h)\,$.

1. $U\models \forall y\varphi(\alpha, y)$ iff for every object $Y$ and all pairs of generalized elements $g:V\to U$ and $h:V\to Y\,$, $V\models \varphi(\alpha\circ g,h)\,$.

## Lawvere on Kripke-Joyal semantics

> To workers in algebraic geometry and analysis, it may appear somewhat excessive to detour through an elaborate Mitchell-B&#233;nabou language which in turn requires a Kripke-Joyal semantics in order to get back at the mathematical content of a specific topos. (That sometimes-recommended procedure is strictly analogous to defining a group to be the quotient of the free group generated by itself, which analogously is sometimes useful). The key clause in that semantics was presupposed in the title 'Quantifiers and Sheaves', but the linear case was a theorem in Godement 1958 and indeed just expresses in terms of 20th century concepts the content of Volterra's local existence theorem. Briefly,

> a) the rule of inference for existential quantification is just a symbolic expression of the universal property enjoyed by the geometric image of any map (not only in the category of sets where the axiom of choice holds, but) in any topos,

> b) a figure lying in such an image comes in fact only locally from figures in the domain of the map.
