## Idea

In a [[conformal field theory]] the conditions on [[correlators]] can be divided into two steps

1. for a fixed [[cobordism]] the correlators need to depend in a certain way on the choice of [[conformal structure]], they need to satisfy the [[Ward identities]] (e.g. [Gawedzki 99, around p. 30](#Gawedzki99));

1. the correlators need to glue correctly underly composition of cobordisms.

The spaces of functionals that satisfy the first of these conditions are called _conformal blocks_ . The second condition is called the [[sewing constraint]] on conformal blocks.

So conformal blocks are something like "precorrelators" or "potential correlators" of a [[CFT]]. 

The assignment of spaces of conformal blocks to surfaces and their [[isomorphisms]] under [[diffeomorphisms]] of these surfaces together constitutes the _[[modular functor]]_. Under [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|CS/WZW holography]] this is essentially the data also given by the [[Hitchin connection]], see at _[[quantization of 3d Chern-Simons theory]]_ for more on this.

From a point of view closer to [[number theory]] and [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] elements of conformal blocks are naturally thought of ([Beauville-Laszlo 93](#BeauvilleLaszlo93)) as generalized [[theta functions]] (see there for more).


## Properties

### Holographic correspondence

The conformal blocks at least of the [[WZW model]] are by a [[holographic principle|holographic]] correspondence given by the [[space of quantum states]] of 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]]. See at _[[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]]_.

### Relation to equivariant elliptic cohomology

For the $G$-[[WZW model]] the assignment of spaces of conformal blocks, hence by the above equivalently modular functor for $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] restricted to [[genus of a surface|genus-1 surfaces]] ([[elliptic curves]]) is essentially what is encoded in the universal $G$-[[equivariant elliptic cohomology]] (equivariant [[tmf]]). In fact equivariant elliptic cohomology remembers also the [[local prequantum field theory|pre-quantum]] incarnation of the modular functor as a systems of [[prequantum line bundles]] over Chern-Simons [[phase spaces]] (which are [[moduli stacks of flat connections]]) and remembers the [[quantization]]-process from there to the actual [[space of quantum states]] by forming holomorphic [[sections]]. See at _[equivariant elliptic cohomology -- Idea -- Interpretation in Quantum field theory](equivariant+elliptic+cohomology#InterpretationInQuantumFieldTheory)_ for more on this.
