## Idea

The term _functional_ is used in two meanings: 

* either a $k$-valued, usually linear, [[function]] on a $k$-[[vector space]] (or [[module]]), where $k$ is a [[field]] (or any [[rig]]); 

  discussed below in _[In linear algebra and functional analysis](#Linear)_

* or a suitably well behave [[function]] on some [[mapping space]], for instance a [[path space]] or the like

  discussed below in _[Nonlinear functionals](#Nonlinear)_.

Of course the two meanings may overlap.

Physicists and engineers usually speak of _functions_ if the argument is a [[variable]] of [[type]] the [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]]; but speak of a _functional_ if the type is a [[mapping space]].

Some special cases include

* in linear [[functional analysis]] one most often studies continuous _linear_ functionals: linear [[function]]s on [[topological vector space]]s. This includes for instance [[distribution]]s.

* in [[variational calculus]] one studies functions on spaces of [[sections]] of [[jet bundles]]. For example, they appear in [[physics]] as [[action functionals]].
 
* various discretised versions are interesting in finite geometries as well as numerical analysis

### Definition

A **functional** is a [[function]] $V \to k$ from a [[vector space]] to the [[ground field]] $k$.  A __linear functional__ is a [[linear map|linear]] such function, that is a [[morphism]] $V \to k$ in $k$-[[Vect]].  In the case that $V$ is a [[topological vector space]], a __continuous linear functional__ is a [[continuous map|continuous]] such map (and so a morphism in the category [[TVS]]).  When $V$ is a [[Banach space]], we speak of __[[bounded operator|bounded]] linear functionals__, which are the same as the continuous ones.


### Remarks

In a sense, linear functionals are co-probes for vector spaces. If the vector space $V$ in question has finite [[dimension]] and is equipped with a [[basis]], then all linear functionals are [[linear combinations]] of the [[coordinate projection]]s. These projections are known as the _[[dual basis]]_.

In infinite-dimensional [[topological vector spaces]], the notion of dual basis breaks down once spaces more general than [[Hilbert spaces]] are considered. But for [[locally convex spaces]], the [[Hahnâ€“Banach theorem]] ensures the existence of 'enough' continuous linear functionals.  Among non-LCSes, however, there are examples such that the only continuous linear functional is the constant map onto $0 \in k$.
