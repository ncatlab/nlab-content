
A **functional** is a map $V \to k$ in $Vect_k$ from a [[vector space]] to the ground [[field]]. In the case that $V$ is a [[TVS]], then this map is necessarily continuous. 

In a sense, functional are co-probes for vector spaces. If the vector space $V$ in question is finite dimensional and is equipped with a basis, then all functionals are linear combinations of the coordinate projections. These projections are known as the _dual basis_. 

In infinite dimensional vector spaces, the notion of dual basis breaks down once (topological) vector spaces more general than Hilbert spaces are considered. In this case, the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] ensures the existence of 'enough' (continuous) functionals. Note that for a non-locally convex TVS the Hahn-Banach theorem may fail. There are even examples of TVS such that the only functional is the constant map onto $0\in k$.
