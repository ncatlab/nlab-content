## Definition

A morphism $f\colon A\to B$ in a [[2-category]] $K$ is called **discrete** if it is representably [[faithful morphism|faithful]] and [[conservative morphism|conservative]], i.e. if for any $X$ the induced functor
$$ K(X,A) \to K(X,B) $$
is [[faithful functor|faithful]] and [[conservative functor|conservative]].

An object $A$ is called a **discrete object** if for any $X$, the category $K(X,A)$ is ([[equivalence of categories|equivalent to]]) a [[discrete category]], i.e. a [[set]].  If $K$ has a ([[2-limit|2-]])[[terminal object]] $1$, this is equivalent to saying that the unique map $A\to 1$ is a discrete morphism.


### Caveat

**NB:** it is more common to define these concepts in the other order: to first define an object to be discrete, as we have done, and then say that $f\colon A\to B$ is a discrete morphism if is a discrete object in the [[slice 2-category]] $K/B$.  In general this does *not* result in the same notion of "discrete morphism" as the definition we have given.  For instance, if $B$ is the [[interval category]] $(0\to 1)$ and $A$ is the free [[parallel pair]] $(0 \rightrightarrows 1)$, then the obvious functor $A\to B$ is a discrete object of $Cat/B$, but is not faithful.

However, the two definitions do coincide for [[fibration in a 2-category|fibrations]], opfibrations, and [[two-sided fibration]]s.  That is, if $f\colon A\to B$ is a fibration or an opfibration in $B$, then it is faithful and conservative if and only if it is a discrete object of $K/B$, and similarly if $A\leftarrow E \to B$ is a two-sided fibration, then $E\to A\times B$ is faithful and conservative if and only if it is a discrete object of $K/(A\times B)$.  Since this is usually the case of most interest (giving rise to [[discrete fibrations]] and, dually, [[codiscrete cofibrations]]), the difference between the two definitions is usually unimportant.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I believe that in cases when the two are different, it is the one given above (faithful and conservative) that is often the better one; hence my proposal in writing this page to change terminology slightly.  Disagreements are welcome.

## Factorization systems and discrete reflections

Discrete morphisms are often the right class of a [[factorization system in a 2-category|factorization system]].  This factorization system, or one related to it, plays a role in the construction of a [[proarrow equipment]] from [[codiscrete cofibrations]].
