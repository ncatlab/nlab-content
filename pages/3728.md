## Definition

For $C$ a [[quasi-category]], a morphism $f : x \to y$ in $C$ (an edge in the underlying [[simplicial set]]) is an **equivalence** if its image in the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(C)$ is an [[isomorphism]].

Equivalently, $f$ is an equivalence if it is the image of a functor of quasi-categories (i.e. a map of simplicial sets) out of the [[nerve]] $N(J)$, where $J$ is the [[interval groupoid]].  This is a quasi-categorical version of the general theorem-schema in [[higher category theory]] that any [[equivalence]] can be improved to an [[adjoint equivalence]].
