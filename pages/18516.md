## Idea

The _microcausal functionals_ on the space $C^\infty(X)$ of [[smooth functions]] on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] $(X,e)$ are those which come from [[compactly supported distributions]] on some [[Cartesian product]] of copies of $X$ such that the [[wave front set]] of the distributions excludes those covectors to a point in $X^n$ all whose components are in the [[future cone]] or all whose components are in the [[past cone]]

These functionals underly the [[Wick algebra]] of [[free field theories]]. The condition on the wave front is such that the [[product of distributions]] with a [[Hadamard distribution]] is well defined, so that the coresponding [[Moyal star product]] is well defined, which gives the [[Wick algebra]]. At the same time the condition is flexible enough to allow the usual ([[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]) point-[[interaction]] terms, such as of [[phi^4 theory]], see example \ref{AdiabaticallySwitchedPointInteractions} below.

## Definition

Let $(X,e)$ be a [[spacetime]] (a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]).

###### Definition
**(smooth functionals on smooth functions)


For $f \in C_c^\infty(X)$ a [[bump function]], it induces the function given by [[integration]]

$$
  \array{   
    C^\infty(X) &\overset{\Phi(f)}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \phi &\mapsto& \int_X f \cdot \phi dvol_g
  }
  \,,
$$

where $dvol_g$ denotes the [[volume form]] of the given [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]], and similarly if $f \in C_c^\infty(X^n)$ is a bump function on the $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]] manifold, then there is

$$
  \array{   
    C^\infty(X) &\overset{\Phi(f)}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \phi &\mapsto& \int_X f \cdot \phi^n dvol_g
  }
  \,,
$$

Write $\mathcal{F}_{reg}$ for the sub-algebra of smooth functions on the smooth space $C^\infty(X)$ which is generated from the functions $\Phi(f)$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $f \in C^\infty_c(X^n)$.

A further evident generalization of this takes $f \in \mathcal{E}'(X^n)$ to be a [[compactly supported distribution]] and induces the function

$$
  \array{   
    C^\infty(X) &\overset{\Phi(f)}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \phi &\mapsto& \langle f, \phi^{\otimes^n} \rangle_g
  }
  \,.
$$

Write $\mathcal{F}_{dist}$ for the subalgebra generated by these functionals.

+-- {: .num_defn #MicrocausalFunctionals}
###### Definition
**([[microcausal functionals]])**


Write $\mathcal{F}_{mc} \subset \mathcal{F}_{dist}$ for the subalgebra of smooth functionals 

$$
  C^\infty(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

on the [[smooth space]] of smooth functions on $X$ which is generated from those [[distributions]] on some Cartesian product $X^n$ (as in def. \ref{SmoothFunctionalsOnSmoothFunctions}) whose [[wave front set]] excludes those covectors to a point in $X^n$ all whose components are in the [[future cone]] or all whose components are in the [[past cone]].

=--

After [[deformation quantization]] to the [[Wick algebra]]/[[interacting field algebra]], this is the origin of "[[operator-valued distributions]]" in [[perturbative quantum field theory]].


## Examples


+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example
**(regular functionals are microcausal)**

Every regular functional (def. \ref{SmoothFunctionalsOnSmoothFunctions}) is a [[microcausal functional]] (def. \ref{MicrocausalFunctionals}), since the [[wave front set]] of a distribution that is given by an ordinary function is empty:

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{reg} \subset \mathcal{F}_{mc}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example #AdiabaticallySwitchedPointInteractions}
###### Example
**([[adiabatic switching|adiabtaically switched]] point interactions are microcausal)**

Let $g \in C^\infty_c(X)$ be a [[bump function]], then for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the smooth functional

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty(X) &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \phi &\mapsto& \int_X g(x) (\phi(x))^n dvol(x)
  }
$$

is a [[microcausal functional]] (def. \ref{MicrocausalFunctionals}).

If here we think of $\phi(x)^n$ as a point-[[interaction]] term (as for instance in [[phi^4 theory]]) then $g$ is to be thought of as an "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]" [[coupling constant]]. These are the relevant interaction terms to be quantized via [[causal perturbation theory]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For notational convenience, consider the case $n = 2$, the other cases are directly analogous. The distribution in question is the [[delta distribution]]

$$
  \int_X g(x) \phi(x)^2 dvol(x)
  \;=\;
  \int_{X \times X} g(x_1) \phi(x_1) \phi(x_2) dvol(x_1) dvol(x_2)
  =
  \langle g \cdot \delta(-,-) , (\phi \circ pr_1)\cdot (\phi \circ pr_2)  \rangle_g
  \,.
$$

Now for $(x_1, x_2) \in X \times X$ and $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \simeq U \subset X \times X$ a [[chart]] around this point,  the [[Fourier transform]] of $g \cdot \delta(-,-)$ restricted to this chart is proportional to the Fourier transform $\hat g$ of $g$ evaluated at the sum of the two covectors:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (k_1, k_2) 
      & \mapsto 
     \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2n}} g(x_1) \delta(x_1, x_2) \exp( k_1 \cdot x_1 + k_2 \cdot x_2 ) dvol(x_1) dvol(x_2)
    \\
    & \propto \hat g(k_1 + k_2)
   \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$


Since $g$ is a plain [[bump function]], its Fourier transform $\hat g$ is quickly decaying (in the sense of wave front sets)  with $k_1 + k_2$ ([this prop.](wavefront+set#EmptyWaveFronSetCorrespondsToOrdinaryFunction)). Thus only on the cone $k_1 + k_2 = 0$ that function is in fact constant and in particular not decaying.

</div>

This means that the wave front set consists of the element of the form $(x, (k, -k))$ with $k \neq 0$. Since $k$ and $-k$ are both in the [[future cone]] or both in the past cone precisely if $k = 0$, this situation is excluded in the wave front set and hence the distribution $g \cdot \delta(-,-)$ is microcausal.

This shows that microcausality in this case is related to conservation of momentum in th point interaction.

More generally:

+-- {: .num_example #CompactlySupportedPolynomialLocalDensities}
###### Example
**(compactly supported polynomial local densities are microcausal)**

Write

$$
  \Omega_{poly}^{h,v}(E)
$$

for the space of differential forms on the [[jet bundle]] 
of the [[field bundle]] $E$ which locally are [[polynomials]]
in the field variables.

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{loc}
    \; \subset \;
  C^\infty_c(\Sigma) \underset{\Omega_{poly}^{0,0}(E)}{\otimes} \Omega_{poly}^{d,0}(E)
$$

for the subspace of [[horizontal differential forms]] of degree $d$ on the [[jet bundle]] ([[local Lagrangian densities]])
of those which are [[compact support|compactly supported]] with respect to $\Sigma$ and [[polynomial]] with respect to the 
field variables.

Every $L \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}$ induces a functional

$$
   \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

by [[integration of differential forms|integration]] of the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]]
of $L$ along the [[jet prolongation]] of a given [[section]]:

$$
  \phi \mapsto \int_{\Sigma} j^\infty(\phi)^\ast L 
  \,.
$$

These functionals happen to be [[microcausal functional|microcausal]], so that there is an inclusion

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{loc} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{F}_{mc}
$$

into the space of microcausal functionals (e.g. [Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, p. 21](#FredenhagenRejzner12)). In fact this is a [[dense subspace]] inclusion (e.g. [Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, p. 23](#FredenhagenRejzner12))
