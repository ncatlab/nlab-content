## Definition

In any [[topos]] the pair of classes of morphisms ([[epimorphism]]s, [[monomorphism]]s) forms an [[orthogonal 
factorization system]].

## Properties

This is the special case of the [[n-connected/n-truncated factorization system]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] for the case that $(n = -1)$ and restricted to [[0-truncated]] [[object]]s.
