## Idea

[[Dustin Clausen]] says in [this comment on the nCafé](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/03/pyknoticity_versus_cohesivenes.html#c057781):

> Namely, I claim that if you’re willing to pass to suspension spectra, then you do get a fully well-defined functor which takes a CW-complex (viewed as a condensed set) to the suspension spectrum of its associated anima. But now this is not a functor to ordinary spectra, but a functor to condensed spectra which happens to take “discrete” values (discrete in the condensed direction) on CW-complexes.

> Actually, what you really have is a colimit-preserving endofunctor of condensed spectra, which when applied to the suspension spectrum of a CW complex (viewed as a condensed set) gives the suspension spectrum of its associated anima. This is the “solidification” functor, which works for spectra much in the same way it works for abelian groups.
