##Idea
In the [[stable homotopy category]] of p-local [[spectra]] for some prime number p, there are two collections of similarly behaved spectra: the [[Morava K-theories]] and spectra which are the telescopes of [[finite spectra]] under their $v_n$-maps. The former are usually denoted $K(n)$ and the latter are often denoted $T(n)$.  The telescope conjecture is that localization at $K(n)$ and localization at $T(n)$ are (Bousfield) equivalent.
