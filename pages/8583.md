## Idea

In the [[stable homotopy category]] of $p$-local [[spectra]] for some [[prime number]] $p$, there are two collections of similarly behaved spectra: the [[Morava K-theories]] and spectra which are the telescopes of [[finite spectra]] under their $v_n$-maps. The former are usually denoted $K(n)$ and the latter are often denoted $T(n)$.  The _telescope conjecture_ is that [[localization]] at $K(n)$ and localization at $T(n)$ are [[Bousfield equivalence|(Bousfield) equivalent]].
