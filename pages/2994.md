## Definition

### As partial functions

If $k$ is a field, then there is an injection $i:k(x) \to Mor(Part(k))$ from the field of [[rational expression]] to the set of [[morphisms]] $Mor(Part(k))$ of the [[category of partial functions]] $Part(k)$. The image $\im(i)$ is known as the set of **rational functions**. The injection $i$ is defined as follows: given the polynomial ring $k[x]$, there is a canonical injection $j:k[x] \to (k \to k)$ which sends [[constant]] polynomials in $k[x]$ to [[constant functions]] in $k \to k$, and the [[generator]] $x \in k[x]$ to the [[identity function]] $id_k$, where $k \to k$ is the set of [[endomorphisms]] on $k$. 

Work in progress

Given two polynomials $p, q \in k[x]$, we may associate a [[partial function]] $k \rightharpoonup k$ whose [[domain]] consists of $a \in k$ such that $q(a) \neq 0$ (defining $q(a)$ as usual as the value of $q$ under the unique $k$-algebra map $k[x] \to k$ sending $x$ to $a$), and sending each $a$ in the domain to $\frac{p(a)}{q(a)}$. 

### As functions on the projective line

It is perhaps more illuminating to think of this partial function (with domain $D$) as coming from a (total) function $[p/q]: \mathbb{P}^1(k) \to \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ on the [[projective line]], where we have inclusion functions $i: k \to \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ and the partial function is given by the pair of projection maps in the [[pullback]] 

$$\array{
D & \to & k \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow_\mathrlap{i} \\ 
k & \underset{[p/q] \circ i}{\to} & \mathbb{P}^1(k) 
}$$ 

It should also be noticed that such endofunctions $[p/q]$ on $\mathbb{P}^1(k)$ are closed under composition (except that special provision must be made for the constant function valued at $\infty$, which corresponds to the "fraction" $1/0$). 

## Properties

### As continuous functions
