## Definition

Given an [[integral domain]] $R$, the commutative _ring of **rational functions**_ $R(z)$ with coefficients in $R$ is the [[field of fractions]] of the [[polynomial ring]] $R[z]$.  

Let $X$ be an [[affine variety]] over a field $k$ with the ring of [[regular function]]s $\mathcal{O}(X)$. A __rational function__ is any element of the [[field of fractions]] of $\mathcal{O}(X)$, that is the [[function field]] of the variety.

### As "functions" 

In either case, rational functions are [[equivalence classes]] of fractions; they need not be [[functions]] defined everywhere. If $k$ is a field, then to each fraction $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \in k(x)$ with $p, q \in k[x]$ relatively prime, we may associate a [[partial function]] $k \rightharpoonup k$ whose [[domain]] consists of $a \in k$ such that $q(a) \neq 0$ (defining $q(a)$ as usual as the value of $q$ under the unique $k$-algebra map $k[x] \to k$ sending $x$ to $a$), and sending each $a$ in the domain to $\frac{p(a)}{q(a)}$. For the purposes of most elementary mathematics, the domain given here may be described as the "natural domain" of the rational function. 

It is perhaps more illuminating to think of this partial function (with domain $D$) as coming from a (total) function $[p/q]: \mathbb{P}^1(k) \to \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ on the [[projective line]], where we have inclusion functions $i: k \to \mathbb{P}^1(k)$ and the partial function is given by the pair of projection maps in the [[pullback]] 

$$\array{
D & \to & k \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow_\mathrlap{i} \\ 
k & \underset{[p/q] \circ i}{\to} & \mathbb{P}^1(k) 
}$$ 

It should also be noticed that such endofunctions $[p/q]$ on $\mathbb{P}^1(k)$ are closed under composition (except that special provision must be made for the constant function valued at $\infty$, which corresponds to the "fraction" $1/0$).
