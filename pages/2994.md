## Definition

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the commutative _ring of **rational functions**_ $R(z)$ with coefficients in $R$ is the [[field of fractions]] of the [[polynomial ring]] $R[z]$.  

Let $X$ be an [[affine variety]] over a field $k$ with the ring of [[regular function]]s $\mathcal{O}(X)$. A __rational function__ is any element of the [[field of fractions]] of $\mathcal{O}(X)$, that is the [[function field]] of the variety.

In either case, rational functions are [[equivalence classes]] of fractions; they need not be [[functions]] defined everywhere.
