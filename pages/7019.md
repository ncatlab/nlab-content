**Homotopy level** is another name for the notion of [[truncated object|truncation]] (particularly in [[(âˆž,1)-categories]] and their internal language of [[homotopy type theory]]) in which the numbering is offset by 2.  This enables it to "start" at 0 rather than (-2), which is convenient when defining it by induction over the natural numbers in type theory.  Thus, the correspondence between the various terminologies is indicated in the following table.

 Homotopy level | Truncation       |   Groupoids                       | Homotopy type theory
----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------
  h-level 0     |   (-2)-truncated | [[(-2)-groupoid]]/[[point]]       | [[contractible type]]
  h-level 1     |   (-1)-truncated | [[(-1)-groupoid]]/[[truth value]] | [[h-proposition]]
  h-level 2     |   0-truncated    | [[0-groupoid]]/[[set]]            | [[h-set]]
  h-level 3     |   1-truncated    | [[1-groupoid]]/[[groupoid]]       | h-groupoid
  h-level 4     |   2-truncated    | [[2-groupoid]]                    | h-2-groupoid
