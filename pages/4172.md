## Idea

The notion of _bimonoidal category_ is the [[categorification]] of the notion of [[rig]] in the way that the notion of [[monoidal category]] is the categorification of the notion of [[monoid]].

## Definition

A **bimonoidal category** is a [[category]] $R$ with two structures $(R,\otimes, 1)$ and $(R.\oplus, 0)$ of a [[monoidal category]], which satisfy a distributivity law up to natural isomorphism among each, paralleling that for addition and multiplication in a [[rig]].
