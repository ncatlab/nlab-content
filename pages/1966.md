
Sjoerd Crans has mainly worked on aspects of the [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic definition of higher categrories]], notably on clariyfing the right [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] on [[geometric shapes for higher structures|globular]] [[omega-category|ω-categories]] that achives the analogous effect that the simple [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] product does on [[simplicial set]]s. This is now known as the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

Crans also made an infuential contribution to the theory of [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]] in his study of the [[model structure on simplicial sheaves]].
