## Definition

### In general

Given a [[gauge field]] configuration modeled by a $G$-[[principal connection]], its **instanton sector** or **charge sector** is the [[equivalence class]] of the underlying [[principal bundle]].

### In $SU(n)$-Yang-Mills theory

Notably for [[Yang-Mills theory]] on a 4-dimensional [[spacetime]] and with a [[gauge group]] the [[special unitary group]] $G = SU(n)$,  $G$-[[principal bundles]] $P$ are entirely classified by their [[second Chern class]] $c_2(P)$ and hence the value $c_2(P) \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is the instanton sector. Given the $G$-[[principal connection]] of the gauge field the image in [[de Rham cohomology]] of this class may be expressed by the [[integration of differential forms]] $[\int_{X} \langle F_\nabla , \F_\nabla \rangle] \in H_{dR}^4(X)$, where $F_{\nabla}$ is the [[curvature]] and $\langle -,-\rangle$ the [[invariant polynomial]] which corresponds to $c_2$ under the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]].
