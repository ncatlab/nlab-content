## Idea

In the context of [[arithmetic geometry]] a _higher regulator_, or just _regulator_ for short, is a [[homomorphism]] from [[algebraic K-theory]] to a suitable [[ordinary cohomology]] theory. (It makes sense to think that it "regulates" [[cocycles]] in [[algebraic K-theory]], which tend to be hard to analyze, to become cocycles in ordinary cohomology, about which typically more may be said.) This generalizes the original concept of a [[regulator of a number field]] which is a measure for the [[group of units]] of the [[ring of integers]] of the number field, in view of the fact that the [[determinant]] function provides a canonical homomorphism $K_1 \to GL_1$ from the first [[algebraic K-theory]] to the [[group of units]].

Regulators are used in the study of [[L-functions]] for instance in the context of the [[Beilinson conjectures]] and the [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]].

The simplest example of such regulators are

* the [[analytic class number formula]];

* the [[Dedekind zeta-function]] of $K$;

* the Dirichlet regulator map, discussed below.

These regulators may be understood as essentially being the [[Chern characters]] in [[algebraic K-theory]] ([Deninger Scholl (2.6)](#DeningerScholl), [Tamme 12](#Tamme12)).  Based on this observation they serve to define [[differential cohomology]]-refinements of algebraic K-theory, namely _[[differential algebraic K-theory]]_ ([Bunke-Tamme 12](#BunkeTamme12)).

## Definition

### Dirichlet and Borel regulator
 {#BorelRegulator}

For $R$ a [[ring]], $K R$ denoting its [[algebraic K-theory]] [[spectrum]] and $\Sigma^n H \mathbb{R}$ a [[suspension]] of the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] of the [[real numbers]], then a regulator of $K R$-[[cohomology theory]] is a [[homomorphism]] of [[spectra]]

$$
  r_{\sigma,p} \;\colon\; K R \longrightarrow \Sigma^p H \mathbb{R}
$$

or equivalently is the induced [[cohomology operations]]. e.g. ([Bunke-Tamme 12, 1.2](#BunkeTamme12))

If here $R$ is the [[ring of integers]] of a [[number field]] and $\sigma \colon R \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a choice of embedding into the [[complex numbers]], then the _Borel regulator_ ([Borel 74](#Borel74)) is of this form, for odd $p$, such that its induced [[cohomology operation]]

$$
  r_{\sigma,p} \;\colon\; K_1(R) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

is the _Dirichlet regulator_ given by

$$
  u \mapsto log {\vert \sigma(u) \vert}
  \,.
$$

A description of this in [[differential algebraic K-theory]] is in ([Bunke-Tamme  12, 1.2](#BunkeTamme12)):

for $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], then a class in $K R^0(X)$ is represented by  a [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective module|projective]] $R$-[[module bundle]] $V \to X$. Write

$$
  cycl(V) \in K R^0(X)
$$

for this class. 

Under the chosen embedding $\sigma$ we have the [[complexification]] $V \otimes_\sigma \mathbb{C}$ of this [[module bundle]], which is a [[complex vector bundle]] with (because $R$ is geometrically [[discrete object|discrete]]) a [[flat connection]] $\nabla_{V_\sigma}$.  

The choice of hermitean structure on $V_\sigma$, hence a [[reduction of the structure group]] to the [[unitary group]] induces an adjoint connection $\nabla_{V_\sigma}^\ast$. Write then 

$$
  CS_p(\nabla_{V_\sigma}^\ast, \nabla_{V_\sigma})
$$

for the relative [[Chern-Simons form]] between these two connections, hence for the [[transgression]] of the relative [[Chern character]] in degree $p+1$. 

This is a closed differential form, (the Kamber-Tondeur form, see [Bismut-Lott 95](#BismutLott95)).

This differential form represents, via the [[de Rham theorem]] [[isomorphism]], the Dirichlet regulator above

$$
  r_{\sigma,p}(cycl(V))
  \simeq
  [CS_p(\nabla_{V_\sigma}^\ast, \nabla_{V_\sigma})]
  \in 
  H_{dR}^p(X) \simeq H^p(X,\mathbb{R})
  \,.
$$

In [[differential algebraic K-theory]] this construction can be refined from landing in [[de Rham cohomology]] to landing in genuine [[ordinary differential cohomology]] ([[higher prequantization]]), hence with $CS_p(\nabla_{V_\sigma}^\ast, \nabla_{V_\sigma})$ itself realized as the [[curvature]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (p-1)-bundle with connection]].

### Regulators of generalized algebraic K-theories
 {#ForGeneralizedAlgebraicKTheories}

Based on the [above](#BorelRegulator) abstract formulation of 
the classical Beilinson- and Borel-regulators, the following
general definition suggests itsef:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Consider the following data:

1. For $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$ a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] write $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{C})$ for its [[algebraic K-theory of a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]. 

1. For $A \in Ch_\bullet(Ab)$ any [[chain complex]] write $H A$ for its [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] given by the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]].

Then a _regulator_ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ of the [[algebraic K-theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{C})$ is a [[homomorphism]] of [[spectra]] (hence a [[cohomology operation]])

$$
  r \;\colon\; \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow H A
  \,.
$$

Accordingly the [[spectrum]] of $A$-regulators of $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{C})$ is the [[mapping spectrum]] $[\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{C}), H A]$.

## Properties

### Becker-Gottlieb transfer and GRR for algebraic K-theory

 {#BeckerGottliebTransfer}

For $\pi \colon X \to B$ a [[proper map|proper]] [[submersion]] of [[smooth manifolds]], there is a variant of [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] given by the [[Becker-Gottlieb transfer]] in some $E$-[[cohomology theory]]

$$
  tr_\pi \;\colon\; E^\ast(X) \longrightarrow E^\ast(B)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, for the above [[sheaves]] of $R$-[[modules]] $cycl(V)$ we have the [[direct image]] sheaves $\pi_\ast V$ and there is an identity

$$
  \underset{i \geq 0}{\sum} (-1)^i cycl(R^i \pi_\ast(V))
  \simeq
  tr_\pi(cycl(V))
$$ 

in $K R(B)$. The [above](#BorelRegulator) Borel-Dirichlet regulator $r_{\sigma,p}$ is such that it preseves this as an identity in $H(X,\mathbb{R})$. Hence it plays a role here analogous that of the [[Chern character]] in the [[Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem]].

The [[Becker-Gottlieb transfer]] refines in turn to [[differential cohomology]], hence [[differential algebraic K-theory]] mapping to [[ordinary differential cohomology]], according to ([Bunke-Gepner 13](BunkeGepner13)). 

However, the above relation between direct image of sheaves and push-forward in cohomology receives a correction when refined to [[differential algebraic K-theory]], a correction by a term in the image of the inclusion $a(-)$ of differential forms into [[differential cohomology]], by the [[transfer index conjecture]] one has


$$
  \underset{i \geq 0}{\sum} (-1)^i \widehat{cycl}(R^i \pi_\ast(V))
   + a(something)
  \simeq
  \widehat{tr}_\pi(\widehat{cycl}(V))
$$ 

where the hats denote the [[differential cohomology]] refinement.
