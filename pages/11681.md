## Idea

The [[Hodge theorem]] in the language of [[electromagnetism]]. Over a [[Riemann surface]] this may be regarded as simple case of the _[[Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem]]_.

## Statement

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[orientation|oriented]] [[Riemannian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$. Write $\star$ for the corresponding [[Hodge star]] operator.

Then for every exact [[differential n-form]] $j$ of degree $n-k-1$ there is in each [[de Rham cohomology]] ckass of degree 2 a unique representative closed 2-form $F$

$$
  \mathbf{d} F = 0
$$

such that

$$
  \mathbf{d}\star F = j
  \,.
$$

Reading this as [[Maxwell's equations]] on $(X,g)$ then $g$ is the [[field (physics)|field]] of [[gravity]], $F$ is the [[Faraday tensor]] measuring the [[field strength]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] and $j$ is the [[electric current]].
