## Idea

_Urysohn's lemma_ (prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma} below) states that on a [[normal topological space]] disjoint [[closed subsets]] may be separated by [[continuous functions]] in the sense that a continuous function exists which takes value 0 on one of the two subsets and value 1 on the other (called an "Urysohn function", def. \ref{UrysohnFunction}) below. In fact the  existence of such functions is equivalent to a space being normal (remark \ref{Equivalence} below).

Urysohn's lemma is a key ingredient for instance in the proof of the [[Tietze extension theorem]] and in the proof of the existence of [[partitions of unity]] on [[paracompact topological spaces]].  See the list of implications [below](#Implications).

## Statement

+-- {: .num_defn #UrysohnFunction}
###### Definition
**(Urysohn function)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and let $A,B \subset X$ be disjoint [[closed subsets]]. Then an _Urysohn function_ for this situation is 

* a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to [0,1]$

to the [[closed interval]] equipped with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]], that takes the value 0 on $A$ and the value 1 on $B$:

$$
  f(A) = \{0\}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  f(B) = \{1\}
  \,.
$$ 

=--



+-- {: .num_prop #UrysohnLemma} 
###### Proposition
**(Urysohn's lemma)**

Let $X$ be a [[normal topological space|normal]] (or $T_4$) [[topological space]], and let $A,B \subset X$ be two disjoint [[closed subsets]] of $X$. Then there exists an Urysohn function (def. \ref{UrysohnFunction}).


=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Beware that the function in prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma} may take the values 0 or 1 even outside of the two subsets. The condition that the function takes value 0 or 1, respectively, _precisely_ on the two subsets corresponds to _[[perfectly normal spaces]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #Equivalence}
###### Remark

It is immediate that, conversely, the existence of an Urysohn function (def. \ref{UrysohnFunction}) implies that the topological space is [[normal topological space|normal]]. For let $A, B \subset X$ be disjoint closed subsets, and consider a continuous function $f \colon X \to [0,1]$ with $f(A) = \{0\}$ and $f(B) = \{1\}$ then 

$$
  U_A \coloneqq f^{-1}([0,1/3)
  \phantom{AAA}
  U_B \coloneqq f^{-1}((2/3,1])
$$

are disjoint open neighbourhoods of these subsets. 

Hence Urysohn's lemma shows that a topological space being normal is _equivalent_ to it admitting Urysohn functions.

=--

## Proof

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
of Urysohn's lemma, prop. \ref{UrysohnLemma}


Set

$$
  C_0 \coloneqq A
  \phantom{AAA}
  U_1 \coloneqq X \backslash B
  \,.
$$

Since by assumption

$$
  A \cap B = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

we have 

$$
  C_0 \subset U_1
  \,.
$$

Notice that (by [this lemma](separation+axioms#T4InTermsOfTopologicalClosures)) if a space is normal then every open neighbourhood $U \supset C$ of closed subset $C$ contains a smaller neighbourhood $V$ together with its closure $Cl(V)$

$$
  U \subset V \subset Cl(V) \subset C
  \,.
$$

Apply this fact successively to the above situation to obtain the following infinite sequence of nested open subsets $U_r$ and closed subsets $C_r$

$$
  \array{
    C_0 &&  &&  &&  &\subset&  &&  &&  && U_1
    \\
    C_0 &&  &\subset&  && U_{1/2} &\subset& C_{1/2} &&  &\subset&  && U_1
    \\
    C_0 &\subset& U_{1/4} &\subset& C_{1/4} &\subset& U_{1/2} &\subset& C_{1/2} &\subset& U_{3/4} &\subset& C_{3/4} &\subset& U_1
  }
$$

and so on, labeled by the [[dyadic rational numbers]]

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">

$$
 \{ U_{r} \subset X \}_{r \in \mathbb{Q}_{dy}}
$$

with the property that 

$$
  \underset{r \in \mathbb{Q}_{dy}}{\forall}
  \left(
     A \subset U_r \subset X\backslash B
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  \left(
     r_1 \lt r_2
  \right)
   \Rightarrow
  \left(
     \left(U_{r_1} \subset U_{r_2}\right)
     \,\text{and}\,
     \left(
      U_1 \neq U_2
     \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Define then the function

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow [0,1]
$$

to assign to a point $x \in X$ the [[infimum]] of the labels of those open subsets in this sequence that contain $x$:

$$
  f(x) 
     \coloneqq
  \underset{U_r \supset \{x\}}{\lim} r
$$

Here the [[limit of a net|limit]] is over the [[directed set]] of those $U_r$ that contain $x$, ordered by reverse inclusion.


This function clearly has the property that $f(A) = \{0\}$  and $f(B) = \{1\}$. It only remains to see that it is continuous.
For this it is sufficient to see that for $\alpha \in [0,1]$ then the [[pre-images]] $f^{-1}((\alpha, 1])$ and $f^{-1}([0,\alpha))$ are open

We claim that 

1. $f^{-1}([0,\alpha)) = \underset{r \lt \alpha}{\cup} U_r$;

1. $f^{-1}((\alpha, 1]) = \underset{r \gt \alpha}{\cup} X\backslash C_r$.

Regarding the first point: If $x \in X$ is such that $f(x) \coloneqq\underset{U_r \supset \{x\}}{\lim} r \,\lt \alpha$ this means  that there exists a positive real number $\epsilon$ such that $( f(x)-\epsilon, f(x)+ \epsilon ) \lt \alpha$ and hence, by definition of [[limit of a net]], that there exists $r \in \mathbb{Q}_{dy}$ such that $x \in U_r$ and  $r \lt f(x)+ \epsilon \lt \alpha$, hence such that $r \lt \alpha$.

Regarding the second point: ...
