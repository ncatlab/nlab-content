## Idea

The _pseudocircle_ is a [[finite topological space]] which is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the standard [[circle]].

In other word, for the purposes of [[homotopy theory]] (up to weak homotopy equivalence), it is equivalent to the circle, yet it is a purely finite combinatorial creature.


## Definition

As a [[topological space]], the [[underlying set]] of the pseudocircle is a $4$-set, say $\{l,r,t,b\}$ (for the 'left side', 'right side', 'top point', and 'bottom point' of the circle).  The [[topological structure]], given as the collection of [[open subsets]], is
$$ \{\{l,r,t,b\}, \{l,r,t\}, \{l,r,b\}, \{l,r\}, \{l\}, \{r\}, \empty\} ,$$
that is the topology generated by the [[topological base|base]] $\{\{l,r,t\}, \{l,r,b\}, \{l\}, \{r\}\}$ (which is in fact the unique minimal base and furthermore the unique minimal subbase).

Notice that, as a [[frame]], this topology is a [[subframe]] of the [[frame of opens]] of the usual circle, where the names of $l$, $r$, $t$, and $b$ are taken literally.  These also name a [[partition]] of the circle, and this gives a [[quotient map]] from the circle to the pseudocircle; this map is the promised weak homotopy equivalence.
