## Idea

The [[dual]] of a [[topos]]. A co-elementary topos should be the 1-categorical version of a [[co-Heyting algebra]] (which model [[dual intuitionistic logic]]), and a co-Grothendieck topos should be the 1-categorical version of a [[coframe]] (which model [[closed sublocales]] in [[topology]]). 

## Examples

A [[binary relation]] $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ is *injective* if for all $a \in A$, $b \in A$, and $c \in B$, if $R(a, c)$ and $R(b, c)$ then $a = c$. A binary relation $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ is *onto* if for all $b \in B$ there exists an element $a \in A$ such that $R(a, b)$. The category of sets and injective onto binary relations is a cotopos.
