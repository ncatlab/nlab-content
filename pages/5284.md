## Idea

The _free loop space_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ (based or not) is the space of *all* loops in $X$. This is in contrast to the *based* [[loop space]] of a based space $X$ for which the loops begin and end in the fixed base point $x_0\in X$.

## Definition

#### Modern approach

If $X$ is a [[topological space]], the **free loop space** $L X$ of $X$ is defined as the [[free loop space object]] of $X$ formed in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] [[Top]].

#### Traditional approach

While the definition above requires that we work in a [[convenient category of topological spaces]], the traditional definition is by hand and works for any topological space. 

The free loop space $LX$ is the set $Map(S^1,X)$ of continuous maps in [[compact-open topology]]. If we work in a category of based spaces, then still the topological space $Map(S^1,X)$ is in the non-based sense bit it itself has a distinguished point which is the constant map $t\mapsto x_0$ where $x_0$ is the base point of $X$.
