## Idea

The _free loop space_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ (based or not) is the space of *all* [[loops]] in $X$. This is in contrast to the *based* [[loop space]] of a based space $X$ for which the loops are at the fixed [[base point]] $x_0\in X$.


## Definition

### Explicit description

For $X$ a topological space, the free loop space $L X$ is the topological space $Map(S^1,X)$ of [[continuous map]]s in [[compact-open topology]]. 

If we work in a category of based spaces, then still the topological space $Map(S^1,X)$ is in the non-based sense bit it itself has a distinguished point which is the constant map $t\mapsto x_0$ where $x_0$ is the base point of $X$.

### General abstract description

If $X$ is a [[topological space]], the **free loop space** $L X$ of $X$ is defined as the [[free loop space object]] of $X$ formed in the [[(âˆž,1)-category]] [[Top]].
