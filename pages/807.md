## Idea

The **Euler characteristic** of an object is --  if it exists -- its [[category theory|categorical]] [[dimension]]. 


## Definitions

### Of a chain complex

There are two definitions of the Euler characteristic of a chain complex.  Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let $V$ be a [[chain complex]] of $R$-[[modules]].

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfChainComplexPointset}
###### Definition

If each $V_n$ is [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] and [[projective object|projective]], then the **Euler characteristic** of $V$ is the alternating sum of their [[ranks]], if this is finite:
$$
  \chi(V) := \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n rk_R V_n
  \,.
$$
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfChainComplex}
###### Definition

If the [[homology group|homology]] of $V$ consists of finitely generated projective modules, then the **Euler characteristic** of $V$ is the alternating sum of its [[Betti number]]s (the [[ranks]] of its homology modules), if this is finite:
$$
  \chi(V) := \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n rk_R H_n(V)
  \,.
$$
=--

When both of these are defined, they are equal.  This is a consequence of the functoriality of the categorical definition (Definition \ref{EulerCharInSymMonCat}).

+-- {: .num_remark #InvariantUnderQIso}
###### Remark
Definition \ref{EulerCharOfChainComplex} shows that the Euler characteristic of chain complexes is invariant under the natural notion of [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]] of chain complexes: (zig-zags of) [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.
=--

### Of a topological space (or $\infty$-groupoid)
 {#OfATopologicalSpace}

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfTopSpace}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $R$ some [[ring]], its Euler characteristic over $R$ is the Euler characteristic, according to Def. \ref{EulerCharOfChainComplex}, of its [[homology]] [[chain complex]] (for instance [[singular homology]]), if this is finite: the alternating sum of its [[Betti number]]s

$$
  \chi(X) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} rk_{\mathbb{Z}} H_n(X, R)
  \,.
$$

=--

By default one takes $R = \mathbb{Z}$ to be the [[integer]]s, but it is equivalent to take $R = \mathbb{Q}$ to be the rational numbers.  (Choosing a ring with torsion, however, might result in a different "Euler characteristic".)

This definition is usually known as the **Euler-Poincar&eacute; formula**. Historically earlier was

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfCWComplex}
###### Definition/Proposition

Let $X$ be a finite [[CW-complex]]. Write $cell(X)_k$ for the set of its $k$-cells. Then the Euler characteristic of $X$ is

$$
  \chi(X) = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} (-1)^k \vert cell(X)_k \vert
  \,.
$$

=--

This is equivalently the Euler characteristic of the [[cellular homology|cellular]] chain complex of $X$ according to Definition \ref{EulerCharOfChainComplexPointset}.  Thus, since the homology of $X$ can be computed with cellular homology, this Euler characteristic agrees with the previous one.

In the special case that $X$ is a [[surface]], Def. \ref{EulerCharOfCWComplex} reduces to the historical definition by [[Leonhard Euler]], which implicitly was known already to Descartes around 1620:

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfSurface}
###### Definition/Proposition

Let $X$ be a convext [[polyhedron]]. Then its Euler characteristic is

$$
  \chi(X) = \vert Vertices(X)\vert - \vert Edges(X)\vert + 
   \vert Faces(X)\vert
  \,.
$$

=--

### Of an object in a symmetric monoidal category

All the definitions considered so far can be subsumed by the following general abstract one.

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharInSymMonCat}
###### Definition

The Euler characteristic of a [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal category]] is its categorical [[dimension]]: the [[trace]] of its [[identity]] [[morphism]].
=--

Explicitly, this means the Euler characteristic of an object $X$ is the composite

$$ S \xrightarrow{\eta} X \otimes X^* \xrightarrow{\cong} X^* \otimes X \xrightarrow{\varepsilon} S $$

where $\eta$ and $\varepsilon$ are the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] and counit of the dual pair $(X,X^*)$, and $S$ is the unit object of the symmetric monoidal category.  This subsumes the previous definitions as follows:

* In the category of chain complexes over a ring $R$, an object is dualizable if it is finitely generated overall, and projective in each degree.  Its dual is then given by $(X^*)_n = Hom_R(X_{-n},R)$.  The unit $\eta$ picks out $\sum x \otimes x^*$, where $\{x\}$ encompasses a basis for each $X_n$ and $\{x^*\}$ is the dual basis.

  The symmetry isomorphism $X \otimes Y \xrightarrow{\cong} Y \otimes X$ introduces a sign $x\otimes y \mapsto (-1)^{|y|} y\otimes x$, so that when we then evaluate, we get a contribution of $1$ for each $x$ of even degree and $-1$ for each $x$ of odd degree.  Thus we recover reproduces Def. \ref{EulerCharOfChainComplexPointset}.  Note that the unit object is $R$ itself in degree zero, so that we see $\chi(X)$ only as an element of $R$ (so, for instance, the Euler characteristic in this sense of a rank-$p$ free $(\mathbb{Z}/p)$-module is zero.

* In the [[derived category]] of chain complexes over $R$, an object is dualizable if it is quasi-isomorphic to one of the form above.  A similar argument shows that its Euler characteristic is then computed as in Def. \ref{EulerCharOfChainComplex}.

The Euler characteristic of a topological space or $\infty$-groupoid can also be defined *directly* with this approach, without a detour into homology.  Namely, if $X$ is any [[Euclidean Neighborhood Retract]], such as a finite [[CW complex]] or a [[smooth manifold]], then its [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma_+^\infty X$ is dualizable in the [[stable homotopy category]].  Its dual is the [[Thom spectrum]] of its stable [[normal bundle]], with the unit of the duality being the [[Thom collapse map]].  Its categorical Euler characteristic is then an endomorphism of the sphere spectrum, which can be identified with an integer (via $\pi_0^s(S) = \mathbb{Z}$). See around [DoldPuppe, corollary 4.6](#DoldPuppe)).

Since the categorical definition is purely in terms of the symmetric monoidal structure, Euler characteristics are preserved by any [[symmetric monoidal functor]] (as long as enough of its structure maps are isomorphisms).  Since chains and homology can be made into symmetric monoidal functors, it follows that all the ways of defining the Euler characteristic of a space agree.

See ([PontoShulman](#PontoShulman)) and the discussion at [[Thom spectrum]] for more on this.

### Homotopy cardinality ($\infty$-groupoid cardinality)
 {#HomotopyCardinality}

The [above](OfATopologicalSpace) Euler characteristic of a topological space is the alternating _sum_ over sizes of _homology_ groups. Similar in construction is the alternating _product_ of sizes of [[homotopy group]]s. This goes by the name _[[∞-groupoid cardinality]]_ or _[[homotopy cardinality]]_ . But [below](RelationBetweenDefinitions) we shall see that Euler characteristic of higher categories interpolates between this homotopical and the above homological notion. 

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfSpaceHomotopically}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] / [[homotopy type]] / [[∞-groupoid]], its **[[homotopy cardinality]]** or **[[∞-groupoid cardinality]]** is -- if it exists -- the [[rational number]] given by the alternating product of [[cardinality|cardinalities]] of [[homotopy group]]s

$$
  \chi_{homotop}(X) :=
  \sum_{[x] \in \pi_0(X)}
    \prod_{k =1}^\infty (|\pi_k(X,x)|)^{(-1)^k}
  \,.
$$

### Of posets, groupoids and categories

The process of sending a [[category]] $C$ to its 
[[geometric realization of categories]] ${\vert C \vert} \in $ [[Top]] $\simeq$ [[Grpd]] is a way to _present_ [[topological space]]s, and hence [[∞-groupoid]]s, by a category: we can think of $\vert C \vert$ as the [[Kan fibrant replacement]] of $C$: the [[universal property|universal solution]] to [[weak inverse|weakly inverting]] all [[morphism]]s of $C$.

Up to the relevant notion of [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category]] (which is [[weak homotopy equivalence]]), _every_ [[∞-groupoid]] arises as the [[nerve]]/[[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]] of a category. In fact one can assume the category to be a [[poset]]. (This follows from the existence of the [[Thomason model structure]], as discussed in more detail there.)

Since the combinatorial data in a [[category]] and all the more in a [[poset]] $C$ is much smaller than in that of its [[Kan fibrant replacement]] $\vert C \vert$, it is of interest to ask if one can read off the Euler characteristic $\chi(\vert C \vert)$ already from $C$ itself. This is indeed the case:

#### Of finite categories
 {#LECharOfCategory}

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfCat}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be a finite [[category]]. A **weighting** on $C$ is a [[function]]

$$
 k^{(-)} : ob C \to \mathbb{Q}
$$

satsifying 

$$
  \forall a \in ob C \;:\; \sum_{b \in ob C} \vert C(a,b) \vert k^b
  = 1
  \,,
$$

where $\vert C(a,b)\vert$ is the [[cardinality]] of the [[hom-set]] $C(a,b)$. A **coweighting** on $C$ is a weighting on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.

If $C$ admits both a weighting $\{k^a\}$ and a coweighting $\{k_a\}$, then its **Euler characteristic** is

$$
  \chi(C) := \sum_{a \in ob C} k^a = \sum_{a \in ob C} k_a
  \;\;\;
  \in \mathbb{Q}
  \,.
$$

=--

The definition of Euler characteristic of [[poset]]s  appears for instance in ([Rota](#Rota)). For [[groupoid]]s it has been amplified in [BaezDolan](#BaezDolan). The joint generalization to categories is due to ([Leinster](#Leinster)), where the above appears as def. 2.2.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Notice that this $\chi(C)$ is in general not an [[integer]], but a [[rational number]]. However in sufficiently well-behaved cases, discussed [below](RelationBetweenDefinitions), $\chi(C)$ coincides with the topological Euler characteristic $\chi(\vert C \vert)$ of its [[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]]. Since that is integral, in these cases also $\chi(C)$ is.

=--

#### Of enriched and higher categories
 {#LECharOfEnrichedCat}

Let $V$ be an good enrichment category (for instance a [[cosmos]]) which itself comes equipped with a good notion of cardinality, in the form of a monoidal functor

$$
  |-| : V \to \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

Then the above formula for the Euler characteristic of a category verbatim generalizes to $V$-[[enriched categories]]. The ordinary case is recovered for $V = $ [[FinSet]] and $|-| : FinSet \to \mathbb{R}$ the ordinary [[cardinality]] operation.

Since [[strict infinity-categories]] can be understood as arising from iterative enrichment

$$
  Str2Cat \simeq Cat-Cat
$$

$$
  Str3Cat \simeq Str2Cat-Cat
$$

etc, this gives a notion of Euler characteristic of strict $\infty$-categories, hence in particular of [[strict infinity-groupoid]]s.

One should be able to show that applied to strict $\infty$-groupoids this does reproduce [[homotopy cardinality]].



## Properties

### Compatibility with homotopy colimits
 {#UnderHomotopyColimits}

Euler characteristic behaves well with respect to the basic operations in [[homotopy theory]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

In a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[triangulated category]] with [[dualizable object]]s $X, Y, Z$, if

$$
  \array{
    Z &\to& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& W
  }
$$

is a [[homotopy pushout]], then the [tractial Euler characteristic](EulerCharInSymMonCat) of $W$ exists and is

$$
  \chi(W) = \chi(X) + \chi(y) - \chi(Z)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is due to ([May, 1991](#May)).


### Relations between the various definitions
 {#RelationBetweenDefinitions}

The following propositions assert that and how the various definitions of Euler characteristics all suitably agree when thez jointly apply.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]] let $P_T(X)$ be the [[poset]] of inclusions of [[simplices]] of a [[triangulation]] $T$ of $X$. Then the poset Euler characteristic of $P_T(X)$ coincides with the Euler characteristic of $X$ as a topological space

$$
  \chi(X) = \chi(P_T(X))
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as ([Stanley, 3.8](#Stanley)).

The following proposition asserts that the definition \ref{EulerCharOfCat} of Euler characteristic of a category is indeed consistent, in that it does compute the Euler characteristic, def. \ref{EulerCharOfTopSpace} of the corresponding $\infty$-groupoid:

+-- {: .num_prop #PosteEulerCharGiveSpaceCharUnderRealization}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a finite [[poset]] or, slightly more generally, a finite [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[category]] with no nontrivial [[endomorphism]]s.

Write $\vert C \vert \in $ [[Top]] $\simeq$ [[∞Grpd]] for its [[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]]. Then

$$
  \chi(C) = \chi(\vert C \vert)
  \,.
$$
 
=--

For posets this is due to Philipp Hall, appearing as ([Stanley, prop. 3.8.5]). For finite categories this is  ([Leinster, cor. 1.5, prop. 2.11](#Leinster)).

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[manifold]], regard its [[suspension spectrum]]

$$
  \Sigma^\infty X \in Ho(Spec)
$$

as an object in the [[stable homotopy category]]. Then its Euler characteristic as an object of a [[symmetric monoidal category]], def. \ref{EulerCharInSymMonCat} coincides with its topological Euler characteristic, def. \ref{EulerCharOfTopSpace}.

### Relation between Eulcer characterteistic and $\infty$-groupoid cardinality

For topological space / $\infty$-groupoids, there is both the notion of [homological Euler characteristic](OfATopologicalSpace) as well as the notion of [homotopy cardinality](HomotopyCardinality). 

The latter looks a bit like the "exponential" of the former, so while similar to some extent they are very different notions, taken on face value. Still, the [Euler characteristic of a category](LECharOfCategory) or rather that [of a higher category](LECharOfEnrichedCat) does interpolate between the two notions:

+-- {: .num_prop #ReproducingGroupoidCardinality}
###### Proposition

For $C$ a finite [[groupoid]], its Euler characteristic as a category, def. \ref{EulerCharOfCat}, coincides with its homotopical Euler characteristic, def. \ref{EulerCharOfSpaceHomotopically} or [[groupoid cardinality]]

$$
  \chi(C) = \chi_{homotop}(C)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is noted in ([Leinster, example 2.7](#Leinster)).


+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

For instance for $G$ a [[finite group]] let $B G \simeq K(G,1) \in $ [[Ho(Top)]] be its [[classifying space]]. This is the [[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]] both of the one-object groupoids $*//G$ as well as of some finite [[poset]] $C$.

$$
  B G \simeq |*//G| \simeq |C|
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{PosteEulerCharGiveSpaceCharUnderRealization} we have that the categorical Euler characteristic of $C$ is the topological Euler characteristic of $B G$. But by prop. \ref{ReproducingGroupoidCardinality} we have that the categorical Euler characteristic of $*//G$ is the [[homotopy cardinality]] of $B G$.

=--

Typically for one and the same $\infty$-groupoid, Eucler characteristic and homotopy cardinality are never both well defined: if the series for one converges, that for the other does not.

However, by applying some standard apparent "tricks" on non-convergent series, often these can be made sense of after all, and then do agree with the other notion. For more on this see ([Baez05](#Baez05)).

### Gauss-Bonnet theorem

For $X$ an even-[[dimension]]al [[smooth manifold]], its Euler characteristic may also be given by [[integration]] of [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] data: this is the statement of the higher dimensional [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]].
