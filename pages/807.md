## Idea

The **Euler characteristic** of a [[space]] or [[∞-groupoid]] $X$ is an invariant of $X$ (a value assigned to its [[equivalence class]]) that generalizes the [[cardinality]] of a [[set]] (a [[0-truncated]] $\infty$-groupoid): 

where cardinality counts elements in a set, the Euler characteristic counts [[object]]s up to [[equivalence]]s up to [[2-morphism|2-equivalence]]s up to [[3-morphism|3-equivalence]], and so on. For  that reason it has also come to be known as [[groupoid cardinality]].


There are many different incarnations of [[space]]s and [[∞-groupoid]]s and accordingly there are many different definitions of Euler characteristics, that however agree in good cases.

For instance:

* The Euler characteristic of a [[topological space]] can be defined as the alternating sum of the ranks of its [[homology]] groups (when this is finite).

* There is a definition of Euler characteristic of a (finite) [[poset]], wich computes the topological Euler characteristic of its [[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]]. This can be generalized to a notion of Euler characteristic of (finite) [[categories]].



## Definition

### Of a chain complex

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfChainComplex}
###### Definition

For $V$ a [[chain complex]] of [[module]]s over some [[ring]], its **Euler characteristic** is -- if it exists -- the alternating sum of its [[Betti number]]s: [[integer]] given by the alternating sum of the [[rank]] of its [[homology group]]s

$$
  \chi(V) := \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n rk_R H_n(V)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The Euler characteristic of chain complexes is evidently invariant under the natural notion of [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]] of chain complexes: (zig-zags of) [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.

### Of a topological space / of an $\infty$-groupoid

#### Homological

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfTopSpace}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $R$ some [[ring]], its Euler characteristic over $R$ is -- if it exists -- the Euler characteristic, according to def. \ref{EulerCharOfChainComplex}, of its [[homology]] [[chain complex]] (for instance [[singular homology]]): the alternating sum of its [[Betti number]]s

$$
  \chi(X) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} rk_{\mathbb{Z}} H_n(X, R)
  \,.
$$

=--

By default one takes $R = \mathbb{Z}$ to be the [[integer]]s.

This definition is usually known as the **Euler-Poincar&eacute; formula**. Historically earlier was

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfCWComplex}
###### Definition/Proposition

Let $X$ be a finite [[CW-complex]]. Write $cell(X)_k$ for the set of its $k$-cells. Then the Euler characteristic of $X$ is

$$
  \chi(X) = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} (-1)^k \vert cell(X)_k \vert
  \,.
$$

=--

In the special case that $X$ is a [[surface]] this reduces to the historical definition by [[Leonhard Euler]], which implicitly was known already to Descartes around 1620:

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfSurface}
###### Definition/Proposition

Let $X$ be a convext [[polyhedron]]. Then its Euler characteristic is

$$
  \chi(X) = \vert Vertices(X)\vert - \vert Edges(X)\vert + 
   \vert Faces(X)\vert
  \,.
$$

=--

#### Homotopical

The above Euler characteristic of a topological space is the alternating _sum_ over sizes of _homology_ groups. Similar in construction is the alternating _product_ of sizes of [[homotopy group]]s. This should maybe go by the name $\infty$-[[groupoid cardinality]]. But [below](RelationBetweenDefinitions) we shall see that Euler characteristic of higher categories interpolates between this homotopical and the above homological notion. Therefore it may be justified to speak of _homtopical Euler characteristc_ .

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfSpaceHomotopically}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] / [[homotopy type]] / [[∞-groupoid]], its **homotopical Euler characteristic** or **[[∞-groupoid cardinality]]** is -- if it exists -- the [[rational number]] given by the alternating product of [[cardinality|cardinalities]] of [[homotopy group]]s

$$
  \chi_{homotop}(X) :=
  \sum_{[x] \in \pi_0(X)}
    \prod_{k =1}^\infty (|\pi_k(X,x)|)^{(-1)^k}
  \,.
$$

### Of posets, groupoids and categories

The process of sending a [[category]] $C$ to its 
[[geometric realization of categories]] ${\vert C \vert} \in $ [[Top]] $\simeq$ [[∞Grpd]] is a way to _present_ [[topological space]]s, and hence [[∞-groupoid]]s, by a category: we can think of $\vert C \vert$ as the [[Kan fibrant replacement]] of $C$: the [[universal property|universal solution]] to [[weak inverse|weakly inverting]] all [[morphism]]s of $C$.

Up to the relevant notion of [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category]] (which is [[weak homotopy equivalence]]), _every_ [[∞-groupoid]] arises as the [[nerve]]/[[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]] of a category. In fact one can assume the category to be a [[poset]]. (This follows from the existence of the [[Thomason model structure]], as discussed in more detail there.)

Since the combinatorial data in a [[category]] and all the more in a [[poset]] $C$ is much smaller than in that of its [[Kan fibrant replacement]] $\vert C \vert$, it is of interest to ask if one can read off the Euler characteristic $\chi(\vert C \vert)$ already from $C$ itself. This is indeed the case:

#### Of locally small categories

+-- {: .num_defn #EulerCharOfCat}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be a finite [[category]]. A **weighting** on $C$ is a [[function]]

$$
 k^{(-)} : ob C \to \mathbb{Q}
$$

satsifying 

$$
  \forall a \in ob C \;:\; \sum_{b \in ob C} \vert C(a,b) \vert k^b
  = 1
  \,,
$$

where $\vert C(a,b)\vert$ is the [[cardinality]] of the [[hom-set]] $C(a,b)$. A **coweighting** on $C$ is a weighting on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.

If $C$ admits both a weighting $\{k^a\}$ and a coweighting $\{k_a\}$, then its **Euler characteristic** is

$$
  \chi(C) := \sum_{a \in ob C} k^a = \sum_{a \in ob C} k_a
  \;\;\;
  \in \mathbb{Q}
  \,.
$$

The definition of Euler characteristic of [[poset]]s  appears for instance in ([Rota](#Rota)). For [[groupoid]]s it has been amplified in [BaezDolan](#BaezDolan). The joint generalization to categories is due to ([Leinster](#Leinster)), where the above appears as def. 2.2.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Notice that this $\chi(C)$ is in general not an [[integer]], but a [[rational number]]. However in sufficiently well-behaved cases, discussed [below](RelationBetweenDefinitions), $\chi(C)$ coincides with the topological Euler characteristic $\chi(\vert C \vert)$ of its [[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]]. Since that is integral, in these cases also $\chi(C)$ is.

## Properties

### Relations between the various definitions
 {#RelationBetweenDefinitions}

The following propositions assert that and how the various definitions of Euler characteristics all suitably agree when thez jointly apply.

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]] let $P_T(X)$ be the [[poset]] of inclusions of [[simplices]] of a [[triangulation]] $T$ of $X$. Then the poset Euler characteristic of $P_T(X)$ coincides with the Euler characteristic of $X$ as a topological space

$$
  \chi(X) = \chi(P_T(X))
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as ([Stanley, 3.8](#Stanley)).

The following proposition asserts that the definition \ref{EulerCharOfCat} of Euler characteristic of a category is indeed consistent, in that it does compute the Euler characteristic, def. \ref{EulerCharOfTopSpace} of the corresponding $\infty$-groupoid:

###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a finite [[poset]] or, slightly more generally, a finite [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[category]] with no nontrivial [[endomorphism]]s.

Write $\vert C \vert \in $ [[Top]] $\simeq$ [[∞Grpd]] for its [[geometric realization of categories|geometric realization]]. Then

$$
  \chi(C) = \chi(\vert C \vert)
  \,.
$$
 
=--

For posets this is due to Philipp Hall, appearing as ([Stanley, prop. 3.8.5]). For finite categories this is  ([Leinster, cor. 1.5, prop. 2.11](#Leinster)).

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $C$ a finite [[groupoid]], its Euler characteristic as a category, def. \ref{EulerCharOfCat}, coincides with its homotopical Euler characteristic, def. \ref{EulerCharOfSpaceHomotopically} or [[groupoid cardinality]]

$$
  \chi(C) = \chi_{homotop}(C)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is noted in ([Leinster, example 2.7](#Leinster)).

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[manifold]], regard its [[suspension spectrum]]

$$
  \Sigma^\infty X \in Ho(Spec)
$$

as an object in the [[stable homotopy category]]. Then its Euler characteristic as an object of a [[symmetric monoidal category]], def. \ref{EulerCharInSymMonCat} coincides with its topological Euler characteristic, def. \ref{EulerCharOfTopSpace}.

This is due to ... (?)

### Gauss-Bonnet theorem

For $X$ an even-[[dimension]]al [[smooth manifold]], its Euler characteristic may also be given by [[integration]] of [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] data: this is the statement of the higher dimensional [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]].
