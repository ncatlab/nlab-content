## Idea

In discussion of [[supersymmetry]]: the [[number]] of [[generators and relations|generators]] of odd degree, suitably conceived.

## Definition

A [[supersymmetry]] [[super Lie algebra]] or [[super Lie group]] is determined by the underlying bosonic algebra/group ([[body]]) and a [[real spin representation]] $\mathbf{N}$.

One says that the corresponding _number of supersymmetries_ is either the [[dimension]] 

$$
  N \;\coloneqq\; dim_{\mathbb{R}}\big( \mathbf{N} \big)
$$

of the [[real spin representation]] $\mathbf{N}$, and as such denoted by a roman "$N$",


or, alternatively, the multiplicity 

$$
  \mathcal{N}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (n_i)_{i \in I}
$$

of the [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real spin representations]] $\mathbf{N}^{irr}_{i}$ in a [[direct sum]] decomposition

$$
  \mathbf{N}
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{i \in I}{\oplus}
  n_i \mathbf{N}^{irr}_i
$$

of this [[real spin representation]] $\mathbf{N}$, and as such denoted by a list of calligraphic "$\mathcal{N}$"s.

Typically there is either a single [[irrep]] or precisely two, in which case these multiplicities are either a single [[natural number]]

$$
  \mathcal{N}
  \;\in\;
  \mathbb{N}
$$ 

or a [[pair]] of them

$$
  \mathcal{N}
  \;=\;
  (\mathcal{N}_+, \mathcal{N}_-)
  \,,
$$

respectively.
