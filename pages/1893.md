$\Lambda$ is the ring of [[symmetric function]]s in countably many variables. A **$\Lambda$-ring** is a [[P-ring]] for $P = \Lambda$.

$\Lambda$-rings are also called $\lambda$-rings. 


##Idea##

In many situations, we can take [[direct sum]]s of [[representation]]s of some algebraic gadget.  So, decategorifying, the set of isomorphism classes of representations becomes a [[commutative monoid]]. But nobody likes commutative monoids.  So, we throw in formal negatives and get an [[abelian group]] — the so-called [[Grothendieck group]].

In many situations, we can also take [[tensor product]]s of representations.  Then our Grothendieck group becomes something better than an abelian group.  It becomes a [[ring]]: the [[representation ring]]. But, we're not done!  In many situations we can also take [[exterior power|exterior]] and [[symmetric power|symmetric]] powers of representations.  Indeed, we can often apply any [[Young diagram]] to a representation and get a new representation! Then our representation ring becomes something better than a ring.  It becomes a $\Lambda$-ring!

More generally, the Grothendieck group of a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[abelian category]] is always a ring, but if we start with a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] abelian category, we get a $\Lambda$-ring. So, $\Lambda$-rings are all about getting the most for your money when you decategorify a symmetric monoidal abelian category -- for example the category of representations of a group, or the category of [[vector bundle]]s on a space.


##Connection to arithmetic##

>The theory of $\Lambda$-rings, in the sense of Grothendieck's Riemann--Roch theory, is an enrichment of the theory of commutative rings. In the same way, we can enrich usual [[algebraic geometry]] over the ring $\mathbf{Z}$ of integers to produce $\Lambda$-algebraic geometry. We show that $\Lambda$-algebraic geometry is in a precise sense an algebraic geometry over a deeper base than $\mathbf{Z}$ and that it has many properties predicted for algebraic geometry over the mythical [[field with one element]]. Moreover, it does this is a way that is both formally robust and closely related to active areas in arithmetic algebraic geometry.
