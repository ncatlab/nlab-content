An $n$-dimensional real __differentiable manifold__, or __differential manifold__ $M = M^n$ of class $C^k$ (where either $1\leq k\lt\infty$ is an integer or $k$ is a symbol $\infty$ or $\omega$) is a topological [[manifold]] equipped with an atlas (i.e. cover by local charts) $\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha\to\mathbf{R}^n)\}_{\alpha\in A}$, $U_\alpha^{open}\subset M$, i.e. the homeomorphisms whose local model is real $n$-dimensional space $\mathbf{R}^n$ and where the transition functions $\phi_\beta\circ\phi_\alpha^{-1}|_{\phi_\alpha(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)} : \phi_\alpha(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)\to \phi_\beta(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)$ are of class $C^k$ as maps of domains in $\mathbf{R}^n$, i.e. have continuous $k$-fold [[derivative]]s for $k$-integer (or all derivatives for $k = \infty$ or are analytic functions for $k = \omega$). 
One can similarly model manifolds over some other fields where the analysis is defined, e.g. complex analytic manifolds, quaternionic manifolds and $p$-adic manifolds.

A __[[smooth manifold]]__ (or $C^\infty$-differential manifold, etc) is a manifold that is $C^k$-differential manifold for all $k$.

In the standard extension of this notation to $k = 0$ a $C^0$-manifold is simply a [[topological manifold]]; however we do not usually say that the $C^0$-manifolds are differentiable.
As with topological manifolds, standard treatments usually assume that the differential manifolds are paracompact and Hausdorff as topological spaces, but the differentiability does not inherently need this condition any more than the topological case, and the differential [[non-Hausdorff manifold]]s are sometimes included in treatments or even essentially needed.
