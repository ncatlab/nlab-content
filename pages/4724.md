A __differentiable manifold__, or __differential manifold__ is a [[manifold]] based on [[cartesian spaces]] using transition functions that have continuous [[derivative]]s.

For a [[natural number]] $k \in \mathbb{N}$, A __$k$-differentiable manifold__ (or __$C^k$-differential manifold__, etc) is a manifold with transition functions that have continuous derivatives up to order $k$.  Note that a $C^0$-manifold is simply a [[topological manifold]].

A __[[smooth manifold]]__ (or $C^\infty$-differential manifold, etc) is a manifold that is $C^k$-differential for all $k$.
