## Idea

A _differentiable manifold_ is a [[topological space]] which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] (a [[topological manifold]]) and such that the [[gluing functions]] which relate these Euclidean [[local charts]] to each other are [[differentiable functions]], for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity then one speaks of _[[smooth manifolds]]_ and if one demands [[analytic function|analytic]] gluing functions then one speaks of _[[analytic manifolds]]_. For a general discussion see at _[[manifold]]_.

Accordingly, a differentiable manifold is a space to which the tools of ([[infinitesimal analysis|infinitesimal]]) [[analysis]] may be applied _locally_.
Notably we may ask whether a [[continuous function]] between differentiable manifolds is [[differentiation|differentiable]]
by computing its [[derivatives]] pointwise in any of the Euclidean [[coordinate charts]].

In particular one may consider smooth functions from the [[real line]] into any smooth manifold $X$, "smooth curves" in $X$. The [[equivalence classes]] of these that have the same first [[derivative]] at a given point capture the idea of "infinitsimal smooth paths" through that point in the manifold, called its _[[tangent vectors]]_. All the tangent vectors at one point $x \in X$ constitute the [[tangent space]] $T_x X$, and the collection of all these tangent spaces yields another differentiable manifold, called the _[[tangent bundle]]_ $T X$. This happens to be a [[vector bundle]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] to a [[principal bundle]], called the _[[frame bundle]]_ $Fr(X)$.

By equipping the [[tangent bundle]] or [[frame bundle]] of a differentiable manifold with [[extra properties]] or [[extra structure]] one encodes _[[geometry]]_ on the manifold. For example equipping them with [[orthogonal structure]] encodes [[Riemannian geometry]] on manifolds. More generally one may consider any _[[G-structure]]_ on the frame bundle and thereby equip the manifold with the corresponding _[[Cartan geometry]]_, for instance _[[complex geometry]]_, _[[conformal geometry]]_ etc.

This way differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for [[differential geometry]]. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what [[schemes]] are in [[algebraic geometry]]. In fact both of these concepts are unified within _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_.

If one relaxes the condition on differentiable manifold from it being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to it just admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the more general concept of [[diffeological spaces]] or even [[smooth sets]], see at _[[generalized smooth space]]_ for more on this. If one generalizes here [[differentiable functions]] to [[simplicial algebra|simplicial]] differentiable functions one obtains concepts of _[[derived smooth manifold]]_.

The generalization of differentiable manifolds to [[higher differential geometry]] are [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[differentiable stacks]]. If one combines this with the generalization to [[smooth sets]] then one obtains the concept of [[smooth stacks]] and eventually [[smooth infinity-stacks]].

### Topological manifolds
 {#TopologicalManifolds}

For convenience, we first recall here some background on [[topological manifolds]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalManifold}
###### Definition
**(topological manifold)**

A _topological manifold is a [[topological space]] which is

1. [[locally Euclidean topological space|locally Euclidean]],

1. [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space|paracompact Hausdorff]].

If the local [[Euclidean spaces|Euclidean]] neighbourhoods $\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} U \subset X$ are all of [[dimension]] $n$
for a fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then the topological manifold is said to be a _$n$-dimensional manifold_ or _$n$-fold_. This is usually assumed to be the case.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(varying terminology)**

Often a topological manifold (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}) is required to be [[sigma-compact]]. But by [this prop.](topological#manifold#RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison) this is not an extra condition as long as there is a [[countable set]] of [[connected components]].
Moreover, manifolds with uncountably many connected components are rarely considered in practice.

###### Definition
**([[local chart]], [[atlas]] and [[gluing function]])

Given an $n$-dimensional topological manifold $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}), then

1. an [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ and a [[homeomorphism]] $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U$ is also called a _[[local coordinate chart]]_ of $X$.

1. an [[open cover]] of $X$ by local charts $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ is called an _[[atlas]]_ of the topological manifold.

1. denoting for each $i,j \in I$ the [[intersection]] of the $i$th chart with the $j$th chart in such an atlas by

   $$
     U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
   $$

   then the induced homeomorphism

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \supset
        \phantom{AA}
     \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})

     U_{i j}
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \phantom{AA}
       \subset
     \mathbb{R}^n
   $$

   is called the _[[gluing function]]_ from chart $i$ to chart $j$.

### Differentiable functions between Cartesian spaces
 {#DifferentiableFunctionsBetweenCartesianSpaces}

For convenience we recall the definition of [[differentiable functions]]
between [[Euclidean spaces]].

+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentiableFunctionBetweenCartesianSpaces}
###### Definition
**([[differentiable functions]] between [[Euclidean spaces]])**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open subset]].

Then a [[function]] $f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called  **differentiable** at $x\in U$
if there exists a [[linear map]] $d f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the following [[limit of a sequence|limit]]
exists as $h$ approaches zero "from all directions at once":

$$
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} = 0.
$$

This means that for all $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ there exists an [[open subset]] $V\subseteq U$ containing $x$ such that whenever $x+h\in V$ we have $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} \lt \epsilon$.

We say that $f$ is _differentiable on_ a [[subset]] $I$ of $U$ if $f$ is differentiable at every $x\in I$, and _differentiable_ if $f$ is differentiable on all of $U$. We say that $f$ is *continuously differentiable* if it is differentiable and  $d f$ is a [[continuous function]].

The map $d f_x$ is called the **derivative** or **differential of $f$ at $x$**.

More generally, let $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ be an [[open subset]].

Then a [[function]] $f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ is _differentiable_  if for all $i \in \{1, \cdots, n_2\}$ the component function

$$
  f_i \;\colon\; U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^{n_2} \overset{pr_u}{\longrightarrow}  \mathbb{R}
$$

is differentiable in the previous sense

In this case, the derivatives $d f_i \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ of the $f_i$ assemble into a linear map  of the form

$$
  d f_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
  \,.
$$

If the derivative exists at each $x \in U$, then it defines itself a function

$$
  d f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow Hom_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1} , \mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \cdot n_2}
$$

to the space of [[linear maps]] from $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$, which is canonically itself a [[Euclidean space]]. We say that $f$ is _twice continuously differentiable_ if $d f$ is continuously differentiable.

Generally then, for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the function $f$ is called _$k$-fold continuously differentiable_ or _of class $C^k$_ if the $k$-fold differential $d^k f$ exists and is a continuous function.

Finally, if $f$ is $k$-fold continuously differentiable for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ then it is called a _[[smooth function]]_
or _of class $C^\infty$_.

=--

Of the various properties satisfied by [[differentiation]], the following plays a special role in the theory of
differentiable manifolds (notably in the discussion of their [[tangent bundles]]):

+-- {: .num_prop #ChainRuleOnEuclideanSpace}
###### Proposition
**([[chain rule]] for [[differentiable functions]] between [[Euclidean spaces]])**

Let $n_1, n_2, n_3 \in \mathbb{N}$ and let

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n_1}
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
    \overset{g}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{n_3}
$$

be two [[differentiable functions]] (def. \ref{DifferentiableFunctionBetweenCartesianSpaces}). Then the
[[derivative]] of their [[composition|composite]] is the composite of their derivatives:

$$
  d(g \circ f) = (d g) \circ (d f)
$$

hence for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ we have

$$
  d(g \circ f)_x = d g_{f(x)} \circ d f_x
  \,.
$$

### Differentiable manifolds
 {#DifferentiableManifolds}


+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentiableManifold}
###### Definition
**([[differentiable manifold]] and [[smooth manifold]])**

For $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then a $p$-fold _[[differentiable manifold]]_ or _$C^p$-manifold_ for short is

1. a [[topological manifold]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold});

1. an [[atlas]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\}$ (def. \ref{Charts}) all whose [[gluing functions]]  are $p$ times continuously [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

A $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between $p$-fold differentiable manifolds

$$
  \left(X,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I} \right)
   \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(Y,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J} \right)
$$

is

* a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$

such that

* for all $i \in I$ and $j \in J$ then

  $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
     \supset
      \phantom{AA}
     (f\circ \phi_i)^{-1}(V_j)
       \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     f^{-1}(V_j)
      \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
     V_j
       \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
     \mathbb{R}^{n'}
  $$

  is a $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between open subsets of [[Euclidean space]].

(Notice that this in in general  a non-trivial condition even if $X = Y$ and $f$ is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.)

If a manifold is $C^p$ differentiable for all $p$, then it is called a _[[smooth manifold]]_.
Accordingly a continuous function between differentiable manifolds which is $p$-fold differentiable
for all $p$ is called a _[[smooth function]]_,



=--

+-- {: .num_remark #CategoryDiff}
###### Remark
**([[category]] [[Diff]] of [[differentiable manifolds]])**

In analogy to remark \ref{TopCategory} there is a [[category]] called [[Diff]]${}_p$ (or similar) whose [[objects]] are $C^p$-[[differentiable manifolds]] and whose [[morphisms]] are $C^p$-[[differentiable functions]], for given $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$.

=--

The analog of the concept of [[homeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) is now this:

+-- {: .num_defn #Diffeomorphism}
###### Definition
**([[diffeomorphism]])**

Given [[smooth manifolds]] $X$ and $Y$ (def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}), then a [[smooth function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is called a _[[diffeomorphism]]_, if there is an [[inverse function]]

$$
  X \longleftarrow Y \;\colon\; g
$$

which is also a [[smooth function]] (hence if $f$ is an [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]]${}_\infty$
from remark \ref{CategoryDiff}).

=--

Here it is important to note that while being a [[topological manifold]] is just a [[property]]
of a [[topological space]], a [[differentiable manifold]] carries [[extra structure]] encoded in the
[[atlas]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #SmoothStructure}
###### Definition
**([[smooth structure]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological manifold]] (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}) and let

$$
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
  \right)_{i \in I}
  \phantom{AAA}
   \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
  \right)_{j \in J}
$$

be two [[atlases]] (def. \ref{Charts}), both making $X$ into a [[smooth manifold]] (def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}).

Then there is a [[diffeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Diffeomorphism}) of the form

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  \left(
    X
      \;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
    \right)_{i \in I}
  \right)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(
    X\;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
    \right)_{j \in J}
  \right)
$$

precisely if the [[identity function]] on the underlying set of $X$ constitutes such a diffeomorphism.
(Because if $f$ is a diffeomorphism, then also $f^{-1}\circ f = id_X$ is a diffeomorphism.)

That the identity function is a diffeomorphism between $X$ equipped with these two atlases means,
by definition \ref{DifferentiableManifold}, that

$$
  \underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \phi_i^{-1}(V_j) \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n
    \phantom{AA}
    \text{is smooth}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Notice that the functions on the right may equivalently be written as

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \supset
   \,
   \phi_i^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)
     \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
    U_i \cap V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \psi_j^{-1}(U_i \cap V_j) \; \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

showing their analogy to the glueing functions within a single atlas spring.

Hence diffeomorphism induces an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of
smooth atlases that exist on a given [[topological manifold]] $X$. An [[equivalence class]]
with respect to this equivalence relation is called a _[[smooth structure]]_ on $X$.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #DifferentiableManifoldCartesianSpace}
###### Example
**([[Cartesian space]] as a [[smooth manifold]])

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the [[atlas]] consisting of the single [[chart]] $\mathbb{R}^n \overset{id}{\to} \mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[smooth manifold]], in particularly a $p$-fold differentiable manifold for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$ according to def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}.

Similarly the [[open disk]] $D^n$ becomes a [[smooth  manifold]] when equipped with the atlas whose single chart is the [[homeomorphism]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to D^n$.

This defines a [[smooth structure]] (def. \ref{SmoothStructure}) on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $D^n$.
Strikingly, precisely for $n = 4$ there are _other_ smooth structures on $\mathbb{R}^4$,
hence called _[[exotic smooth structures]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**([[n-spheres]] as [[smooth manifolds]])**

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ becomes a smooth manfold, with [[atlas]] consisting of the two [[local charts]] that are given by the [[inverse functions]] of the [[stereographic projection]] from the two poles of the sphere onto the [[equator|equatorial]] hyperplane

$$
  \left\{
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \underoverset{\simeq}{\sigma^{-1}_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.
$$

By the formulas given in [this prop.](stereographic+projection#StandardStereographicProjection) the induced [[gluing function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\}$ is a [[rational function]], and hence a [[smooth function]].

Finally the $n$-sphere is a [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space]]. Ways to see this include:

1. $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a [[compact subspace]] by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]]. Compact spaces are evidently also paracompact. Moreover, [[Euclidean space]], like any [[metric space]], is Hausdorff, and [[subspaces]] of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff;

1. The $n$-sphere has an evident structure of a [[CW-complex]] and [[CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces]].

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**([[real projective space]] and [[complex projective space]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$

1. the [[real projective space]] $\mathbb{R}P^n$ has the structure of a [[smooth manifold]]
of [[dimension]] $n$;

1. the [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^n$ has the structure of a [[smooth manifold]] of (real) [[dimension]] $2n$.

where in both cases the [[atlas]] is given by the standard open cover ([this def.](projective+space#TopologicalProjectiveSpaceStandardOpenCover)).

=--

By [this prop.](projective+space#SmoothManifoldRealComplexProjectiveSpace).

We now discuss some general mechanisms by which new differentiable manifolds arise from given ones:

+-- {: .num_example #ProductManifold}
###### Example
**(product manifold)**

Let $X$ any $Y$ be two differentiable manifolds with [[atlases]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}$
and $\{\mathbb{R}^{n'}\underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}$. Then their [[product topological space]] $X \times Y$
becomes an differentiable manifold with respect to the atlas

$$
  \left\{
    \mathbb{R}^{n \cdot n'}
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i \times \psi_j}{\to}
    U_i \times V_j
      \subset
    X \times Y
  \right\}_{(i,j) \in I \times J}
$$

+-- {: .num_example #OpenSubsetsOfDifferentiableManifoldsAreDifferentiableManifolds}
###### Example
**([[open subsets]] of differentiable manifolds are again differentiable manifolds)**

Let $X$ be a $k$-fold differentiable manifold and let $S \subset X$
be an [[open subset]] of the underlying [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$.

Then $S$ carries the structure of a $k$-fold differentiable manifold such that the
inclusion map $S \hookrightarrow X$ is an [[open embedding|open]]
[[embedding of differentiable manifolds]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Since the underlying [[topological space]] of $X$ is [[locally connected topological space|locally connected]] ([this prop.](topological+manifold#LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace)) it is the [[disjoint union space]] of its [[connected components]] ([this prop.](locally+connected+topological+space#AlternativeCharacterizationsOfLocalConnectivity)).

Therefore we are reduced to showing the statement for the case that $X$ has a single [[connected component]]. By [this prop](topological+manifold#RegularityConditionsForTopologicalManifoldsComparison) this implies that $X$ is [[second-countable topological space]].

Now a [[subspace]] of a second-countable Hausdorff space is clearly itself second countable and Hausdorff.

Similarly it is immediate that $S$ is still [[locally Euclidean space|locally Euclidean]]: since $X$ is locally Euclidean every point $x \in S \subset X$ has a Euclidean neighbourhood in $X$ and since $S$ is open there exists an open ball in that (itself [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to Euclidean space) which is a Euclidean neighbourhood of $x$ contained in $S$.

For the differentiable structure we pick these Euclidean neighbourhoods from the given atlas.
Then the [[gluing functions]] for the Euclidean charts on $S$ are $k$-fold differentiable follows since these are restrictions of the gluing functions for the atlas of $X$.

###### Example
**([[general linear group]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[general  linear group]] $Gl(n,\mathbb{R})$
is a smooth manifold
(as an [[open subspace]] of [[Euclidean space]] $GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}$,
via example \ref{OpenSubsetsOfDifferentiableManifoldsAreDifferentiableManifolds} and example \ref{DifferentiableManifoldCartesianSpace}).

The group operations are [[smooth functions]] with respect to this smooth manifold structure, and thus $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$
is a [[Lie group]].
