## Idea 

A _differentiable manifold_ is a [[topological space]] which is _locally_ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Euclidean space]] (a [[topological manifold]]) and such that the [[gluing functions]] which relate these Euclidean [[local charts]] to each other are [[differentiable functions]], for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity then one speaks of _[[smooth manifolds]]_ and if one demands [[analytic function|analytic]] gluing functions then one speaks of _[[analytic manifolds]]_. For a general discussion see at _[[manifold]]_.

Accordingly, a differentiable manifold is a space to which the tools of ([[infinitesimal analysis|infinitesimal]]) [[analysis]] may be applied _locally_. 
Notably we may ask whether a [[continuous function]] between differentiable manifolds is [[differentiation|differentiable]]
by computing its [[derivatives]] pointwise in any of the Euclidean [[coordinate charts]]. 

In particular one may consider smooth functions from the [[real line]] into any smooth manifold $X$, "smooth curves" in $X$. The [[equivalence classes]] of these that have the same first [[derivative]] at a given point capture the idea of "infinitsimal smooth paths" through that point in the manifold, called its _[[tangent vectors]]_. All the tangent vectors at one point $x \in X$ constitute the [[tangent space]] $T_x X$, and the collection of all these tangent spaces yields another differentiable manifold, called the _[[tangent bundle]]_ $T X$. This happens to be a [[vector bundle]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] to a [[principal bundle]], called the _[[frame bundle]]_ $Fr(X)$. 

By equipping the [[tangent bundle]] or [[frame bundle]] of a differentiable manifold with [[extra properties]] or [[extra structure]] one encodes _[[geometry]]_ on the manifold. For example equipping them with [[orthogonal structure]] encodes [[Riemannian geometry]] on manifolds. More generally one may consider any _[[G-structure]]_ on the frame bundle and thereby equip the manifold with the corresponding _[[Cartan geometry]]_, for instance _[[complex geometry]]_, _[[conformal geometry]]_ etc.

This way differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for [[differential geometry]]. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what [[schemes]] are in [[algebraic geometry]]. In fact both of these concepts are unified within _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_.

If one relaxes the condition on differentiable manifold from it being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to it just admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the more general concept of [[diffeological spaces]] or even [[smooth sets]], see at _[[generalized smooth space]]_ for more on this. If one generalizes here [[differentiable functions]] to [[simplicial algebra|simplicial]] differentiable functions one obtains concepts of _[[derived smooth manifold]]_.

The generalization of differentiable manifolds to [[higher differential geometry]] are [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[differentiable stacks]]. If one combines this with the generalization to [[smooth sets]] then one obtains the concept of [[smooth stacks]] and eventually [[smooth infinity-stacks]]. 


## Definition

### Topological manifolds

For convenience, we first recall here some background on [[topological manifolds]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalManifold}
###### Definition
**(topological manifold)**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]].

A _topological manifold_ of _[[dimension]] $n$_ (also "$n$-fold") is 

* a [[paracompact Hausdorff topological space]] $X$ 

such that 

* every point $x \in X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \supset \{x\}$ which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(varying terminology)**

There is some variance in the choice of regularity condition in def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}. Often it is required in addition to being a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] that a manifold have a [[countable set]] of [[connected components]], which then means that it is [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]].

This is the relevant condition for the [[Whitney embedding theorem]] to apply.

Very rarely one considers [[non-Hausdorff topological spaces]] as manifolds.

###### Definition
**([[local chart]], [[atlas]] and [[gluing function]])

Given an $n$-dimensional topological manifold $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold}), then

1. an [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ and a [[homeomorphism]] $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U$ is also called a _[[local coordinate chart]]_ of $X$.

1. an [[open cover]] of $X$ by local charts $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$ is called an _[[atlas]]_ of the topological manifold.

1. denoting for each $i,j \in I$ the [[intersection]] of the $i$th chart with the $j$th chart in such an atlas by

   $$
     U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
   $$ 

   then the induced homeomorphism

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \supset
        \phantom{AA}
     \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_i\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     U_{i j}
       \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
     \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
       \phantom{AA}
       \subset
     \mathbb{R}^n
   $$

   is called the _[[gluing function]]_ from chart $i$ to chart $j$.

### Differentiable manifolds


+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentiableManifold}
###### Definition
**(differentiable manifold)**

For $p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then a $p$-fold _[[differentiable manifold]]_ or _$C^p$-manifold_ for short is 

1. a [[topological manifold]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalManifold});

1. an [[atlas]] $\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\}$ (def. \ref{Charts}) all whose [[gluing functions]]  are $p$ times continuously [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

A $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between $p$-fold differentiable manifolds 

$$
  \left(X,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I} \right)
   \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(Y,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J} \right)
$$ 

is 

* a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ 

such that 

* for all $i \in I$ and $j \in J$ then 

  $$
     \mathbb{R}^n
     \supset
      \phantom{AA}
     (f\circ \phi_i)^{-1}(V_j)
       \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     f^{-1}(V_j)
      \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
     V_j
       \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
     \mathbb{R}^{n'}
  $$

  is a $p$-fold [[differentiable function]] between open subsets of [[Euclidean space]].

Notice that this in in general  a non-trivial condition even if $X = Y$ and $f$ is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.

Hence there is a [[category]] [[Diff]]${}_p$ whose [[objects]] are $C^p$-[[differentiable manifolds]] and whose [[morphisms]] are $C^p$-[[differentiable functions]].

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #DifferentiableManifoldCartesianSpace}
###### Example
**([[Cartesian spaces]] as [[smooth manifolds]])

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the atlas consisting of the single [[chart]] $\mathbb{R}^n \overset{id}{\to} \mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[smooth manifold]], in particularly a $p$-fold differentiable manifold for every $p \in \mathbb{N}$ according to def. \ref{DifferentiableManifold}.

Similarly the [[open disk]] $D^n$ becomes a [[smooth  manifold]] when equipped with the atlas whose single chart is the [[homeomorphism]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to D^n$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**([[n-spheres]] as [[smooth manifolds]])**

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ becomes a smooth manfold, with [[atlas]] consisting of the two [[local charts]] that are given by the [[inverse functions]] of the [[stereographic projection]] from the two poles of the sphere onto the [[equator|equatorial]] hyperplane 

$$
  \left\{
     \mathbb{R}^n 
       \underoverset{\simeq}{\sigma^{-1}_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.
$$

By the formulas given in [this prop.](stereographic+projection#StandardStereographicProjection) the induced [[gluing function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\}$ is smooth.
