
A [[ring]] (or [[rig]], or [[nonassociative ring]], or indeed [[magma]] in any [[Ab-enriched category]]) is __formally real__ if, whenever
$$ \sum_i x_i^2 = 0 $$
(for a finite sum), each $x_i = 0$.

One generally speaks of __formally real algebras__ (possibly [[associative algebra|associative]], possibly [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative]]) over the [[real numbers]], but the concept has nothing to do with the $\mathbb{R}$-linear structure.  That said, the [[trivial ring|trivial algebra]] is the only formally real algebra over the [[complex numbers]]; more generally, if $A \to B$ is a [[monomorphism]] of rings (or of rigs, etc), then $A$ must be formally real if $B$ is.

Of course, the real numbers themselves form a formally real ring; the complex numbers do not, since
$$ \mathrm{i}^2 + 1^2 = 0 .$$

Formally real [[fields]] (like that of the real numbers) are particularly interesting; see [[formally real field]].

Given an [[involution]], we have a generalization: a $*$-[[star-ring|ring]] is __formally complex__ if, whenever
$$ \sum_i x_i^* x_i = 0 $$
(for a finite sum), each $x_i = 0$.  Then a ring is formally real iff it is formally complex when equipped with the trivial involution.  While the complex numbers are not formally real, they are formally complex.

Every formally real (or formally complex) ring has a natural [[partial ordering]]: $a \leq b$ iff $b - a$ can be written as a sum of squares (or a sum of terms of the form $x^* x$).
