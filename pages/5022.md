## Frames in Modal Logics ## 
(The term **frame** is used in a different sense in Modal Logic than in [[Geometric Logic]] where it stands for an abstraction of the algebraic structure corresponding to the lattice of open sets of a topological space.)

We will start with the simplest case, namely a frame for the basic modal language $\mathcal{L}_\omega(1)$, (so with _one_ _binary_ modal operator, denoted $\Diamond$).

######Definition ######
A _frame_ for $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$ is a pair $\mathcal{F} = (W,R)$ with $W$ a non-empty set and $R$ a binary relation on $W$.
=--
(This is also called a _Kripke frame_.)

The terminology often used refers to $W$ as the set of possible worlds.  Its elements are sometimes called _worlds_, sometimes _states_, sometimes _points_, depending on the context and the whim of the writer.
