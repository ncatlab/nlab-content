## Idea

The _Jones polynomial_ is a [[knot invariant]]. It is a special case of the [[HOMFLY-PT polynomial]]. See there for more details.

## Properties

### Relation to 3d Chern-Simons theory

In ([Witten 89](#Witten89)) it was shown that the Jones polynomial as a polynomial in $q$ is equivalently the [[partition function]] of $SU(2)$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] with a [[Wilson loop]] specified by the given [[knot]] as a function of the exponentiated [[level (Chern-Simons theory)|level]] of the Chern-Simons theory. Extensive lecture notes on this are in ([Witten 13a](#Witten13a)).

### Relation to 4d super Yang-Mills theory

Later in ([Witten 11](#Witten11)) this identification was further refined to a correspondence between [[Khovanov homology]] and observables in 4-dimensional [[super Yang-Mills theory]]. Extensive lectures notes on this are in ([Witten 13b](#Witten13b)).
