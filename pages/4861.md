## Idea ##

A [[homotopy]] between two maps $f,g \colon X \to Y$ can be thought of as a path in the mapping space $Map(X,Y)$.  If, instead, one works with the space of [[embeddings]], one gets the notion of an **isotopy**.

Since, for arbitrary topological spaces, the mapping space $Map(X,Y)$ is not always well-defined as a topological space, defining a homotopy as a map $H \colon X \times I \to Y$ is the rigorous way of saying "$H$ is a path from $f$ to $g$ in the mapping space.".  Similarly, the proper definition of an isotopy as a map $H \colon X \times I \to Y$ with the property that $H(-,t) \colon X \to Y$ is always an embedding, is the rigorous way of saying "$H$ is a path from $f$ to $g$ in the embedding space.".

###### Definition
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two [[topological spaces]].  Let $f,g \colon X \to Y$ be two [[embeddings]] of $X$ in to $Y$.  An **isotopy** from $f$ to $g$ is a [[continuous map]] $H \colon X \times [0,1] \to Y$ with the following properties:

1. $H(-,0) = f$
2. $H(-,1) = g$
3. $H(-,t)$ is an embedding of $X$ in to $Y$ for each $t \in [0,1]$.

Two maps for which there exists an isotopy are said to be **isotopic**.

## Properties ##

The first two conditions on $H$ imply that $H$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$.  Therefore the condition of being isotopic is stronger than that of being homotopic.  As the third condition applies level-wise, the proof that homotopy is an equivalence relation carries over to show that the same is true of isotopy.


## Examples ##

Isotopy is used where one wishes to study deformations of an object inside some ambient space that do not change the object itself.  An extremely important example of this is the theory of [[knots]] and [[links]] where, to prevent unknottings and unlinkings, there have to be some restrictions on the allowed movements.  These are usually encoded in terms of isotopies.
