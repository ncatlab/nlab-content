 {#OpenProblemConfinementReferences}

While [[experiment]] as well as [[lattice gauge theory]]-computer simulation clearly show that [[confinement]] takes place, a real theoretical understanding has been missing (though [[AdS-QCD]] is now on a good track). This is the _confinement problem_. The same problem from the point of view of [[mathematics]] is called the _[[mass gap problem|mass gap]] [Millennium Problem](quantization+of+Yang-Mills+theory#ReferencesNonperturbativeTheoryAndMassGap)_. A related problem is the _[flavor problem](flavor+problem#TheFlavorProblem)_.

The following is a list of quotes highlighting the open problem of confinement:

> Nuclear physics is one of the oldest branches of high energy physics, yet remains one of more difficult. Despite the fact that we know the underlying fundamental theory, i.e. QCD, we are still unable to predict, reliably and analytically, behavior of nuclei or even a single proton. The problem is of course that one must understand the strong-coupling regime of QCD, which by and large remains inaccessible except by large-scale lattice simulations. Traditionally, this sets nuclear physics apart from the rest of high energy physics in many aspects. However, [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model|recent developments]] in the so-called [[AdS-CFT|gauge/gravity duality]] began to solve certain strongly coupled field theories,possibly including QCD or its close relatives, allowing the two communities to merge with each other.

> Because of the great importance of the standard model, and the central role it plays in our understanding of particle physics, it is unfortunate that, in one very important respect, we don’t really understand how it works. The problem lies in the sector dealing with the interactions of quarks and gluons, the sector known as Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD. We simply do not know for sure why quarks and gluons, which are the fundamental fields of the theory, don’t show up in the actual spectrum of the theory, as asymptotic particle states. There is wide agreement  about  what  must  be  happening  in  high  energy  particle  collisions:  the  formation of color electric flux tubes among quarks and antiquarks, and the eventual fragmentation of those flux tubes into mesons and baryons, rather than free quarks and gluons. But there is no general agreement about why this is happening, and that limitation exposes our general ignorance about the workings of non-abelian gauge theories in general, and QCD in particular, at large distance scales.

> The problem with a derivation of [[nuclear forces]] from [[QCD]] is that this theory is [[non-perturbative QFT|non-perturbative]] in the low-energy regime characteristic of [[nuclear physics]], which makes direct solutions very difficult. Therefore, during the first round of new attempts, [[QCD]]-inspired [[quark]] models became popular. The positive aspect of these models is that they try to explain [[hadron]] structure and hadron-hadron [[interactions]] on an equal footing and, indeed, some of the gross features of the [[nucleon]]-[[nucleon]] interaction are explained successfully. 

> However, on a critical note, it must be pointed out that these quark-based approaches are nothing but another set of models and, thus, do not represent fundamental progress. For the purpose of describing hadron-hadron interactions, one may equally well stay with the simpler and much more quantitative [[meson]] models.

>  The success of the technique does not remove the challenge of understanding the non-perturbative aspects of the theory. The two aspects are
deeply intertwined. The Lagrangian of QCD is written in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom which become apparent at large energy but remain hidden inside hadrons in the low-energy regime. This confinement property is related to the increase of $\alpha_s$ at low energy, but it has never been
demonstrated analytically. 

> We have clear indications of the confinement of quarks into hadrons from both experiments and lattice QCD. Computations of the heavy quark–antiquark potential, for example, display a linear behavior in the quark–antiquark distance, which cannot be obtained in pure perturbation theory. Indeed the two main characteristics of QCD: confinement and the appearance of nearly massless pseudoscalar mesons, emergent from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, are non-perturbative phenomena whose precise understanding continues to be a target of research. 

> Even in the simpler case of gluodynamics in the absence of quarks, we do not have a precise understanding of how a gap in the spectrum is formed and the glueball spectrum is generated.

> Experimentally, there is a large number of facts that lack a detailed qualitative and quantitative explanation. The most spectacular manifestation of our lack of theoretical understanding of QCD is the failure to observe the elementary degrees of freedom, quarks and gluons, as free asymptotic states (color con- finement) and the occurrence, instead, of families of massive mesons and baryons (hadrons) that form approximately linear Regge trajectories in the mass squared. The internal, partonic structure of hadrons, and nucleons in particular, is still largely mysterious. Since protons and neutrons form almost all the visible matter of the Universe, it is of basic importance to explore their static and dynamical properties in terms of quarks and gluons interacting according to QCD dynamics.

> $[\cdots]$ the QCD Lagrangian does not by itself explain the data on strongly interacting matter, and it is not clear how the observed bound states, the hadrons, and their properties arise from QCD. Neither confinement  nor dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) is apparent in QCD’s lagrangian, yet they play a dominant role in determining the observable characteristics of QCD. The physics of strongly interacting matter is governed by emergent phenomena such as these, which can only be elucidated through the use of non-perturbative methods in QCD [4, 5, 6, 7]

> Since 1973, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has been established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to solve QCD directly in an analytical manner, and many effective models of QCD have been used instead of QCD, but most models cannot be derived from QCD and its connection to QCD is unclear. To analyze nonperturbative QCD, the lattice QCD Monte Carlo simulation has been also used as a first-principle calculation of the strong interaction. However, it has several weak points. For example, the state information (e.g. the wave function) is severely limited, because lattice QCD is based on the path-integral formalism. Also, it is difficult to take the chiral limit, because zero-mass pions require infinite volume lattices. There appears a notorious "sign problem" at finite density.

> On the other hand, [[holographic QCD]] has a direct connection to QCD, and can be derived from QCD in some limit. In fact, [[holographic QCD]] is equivalent to infrared QCD in large $N_c$ and strong 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$, via gauge/gravity correspondence. Remarkably, holographic QCD is successful to reproduce many hadron phenomenology such as [[vector meson dominance]], the KSRF relation, hidden local symmetry, the GSW model and the [[Skyrmion|Skyrme soliton]] picture. Unlike [[lattice QCD]] simulations, [[holographic QCD]] is usually formulated in the chiral limit, and does not have the sign problem at finite density.

> One of the long-standing problems in QCD is to reproduce profound nuclear physics. The strong coupling nature of QCD prevents us from solving it analytically, and even numerical simulations have a limitation such as the volume of the atomic nucleus versus the lattice size.

> More than 98% of visible mass is contained within [[atomic nuclei|nuclei]].  In first approximation, their atomic weights are simply the sum of the masses of all the [[neutrons]] and [[protons]] ([[nucleons]]) they contain.

Even with  such motivation, today, almost fifty years after the discovery of [[quarks]], no rigorous solution has been found. Confinement and EHM are inextricably linked. Consequently, as  science plans for the next thirty  years, solving the problem of EHM has become a _grand challenge_. $[\cdots]$

> in the infrared (IR) limit, QCD enters entirely different, strongly-coupled domain, rendering the Perturbation Theory inapplicable and creating substantial problems for making reliable predictions at intermediate and low momentum transfers, i.e. at large distances. While it is conventionally believed that QCD should remain the correct theory of strong interactions also at large distances, in the so-called confined regime, deriving reliable predictions remains a big theoretical challenge.
