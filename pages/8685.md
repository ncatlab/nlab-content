## Definition

A [[filtered ring]] is a [[filtered object]] in the [[category]] [[Ring]] of [[rings]].

The **associated graded ring** to a filtered ring is the corresponding _[[associated graded object]]_.


## Properties

A version of [[PBW theorem]] states that if a [[Lie algebra]] $g$ over a [[field]] $k$ is [[flat module|flat]] as a $k$-[[module]] over a commutative ground ring $k\supset \mathbb{Q}$ containing [[rational numbers|rationals]], then the associated graded ring $Gr U(g)$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[symmetric algebra]] $Sym(g)$ of the underlying $k$-module of $g$.
