## Idea

An **exactness property** of a [[category]] asserts the existence of certain [[limits]] and [[colimits]], and moreover that the limits and colimits interact in a certain way.  Frequently, this includes stability of the colimits under [[pullback]], and also a condition expressing that some of the input data can be recovered from the colimit.

Many types of exactness can be expressed in terms of "colimits in the left-exact world". 

Exactness properties of a functor refer to preservation of limits or colimits of certain kind, existence of adjoints and possibly their exactness properties.

## Examples

* As particular cases of [[familial regularity and exactness]] we have:
  * A [[regular category]] has [[quotient object|quotients]] of [[kernel pairs]] that are stable under pullback.
  * An [[exact category]] has [[quotient object|quotients]] of [[congruences]] that are stable under pullback.
  * A [[coherent category]] is regular and has finite [[unions]] of [[subobjects]] that are stable under pullback.
  * A [[pretopos]] is coherent and also extensive (see below).
  * A [[Grothendieck topos]] is an infinitary-pretopos that also has a [[generating set]].  Toposes play a universal role for lex colimits; see Garner-Lack.

* An [[extensive category]] has [[coproducts]] that are disjoint and stable under pullback

* An [[adhesive category]] has pushouts of monomorphisms that are stable under pullback and "van Kampen".

* Having [[filtered colimits]] which commute with [[finite limits]] is also an exactness property.

* Exact categories with pullback-stable [[reflexive coequalizers]] are an exactness notion.

* The various types of [[additive and abelian categories]] can also be considered "exactness properties" in a looser sense, though they are not lex colimits in the formal sense.  See also [[AT-category]].

* A [[site]] can be considered as a category with "exactness [[structure]]", or as a way of specifying certain exactness conditions which ought to hold after "completion".
