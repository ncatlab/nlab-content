## Idea

Any [[dg-model category]] $M$ presents an associated [[dg-category]], whose objects are the [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]] [[fibrant object|fibrant]] objects of $M$, and whose [[mapping complexes]] are given by the dg-enrichment of $M$. This [[dg-category]] has the property of being [[fibrant object|fibrant]] in the [[Dwyer-Kan model structure on dg-categories]].

This is the analogue of the [[simplicially enriched category]] presented by a [[simplicial model category]].
