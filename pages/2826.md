## Idea ##

A **Dold fibration** is a continuous map of [[topological space]]s that allows [[right lifting property|lifting]] of [[homotopies]], with initial condition agreeing with a given map up to a [[vertical homotopy]].


## Definition ##

The morphism $f:E \to B$ of [[topological space]]s is said to have the **weak covering homotopy property** (WCHP) for the space $Y$ if for all squares

$$
\begin{matrix}
  Y\times\{0\}& \stackrel{g_0}{\to} & E \\
  \downarrow&&\, \downarrow f\\
  Y\times I &\underset{g}{\to} & B
\end{matrix}
$$
there is a map $\hat{g}:Y\times I \to E$ such that $f\circ \hat{g} = g$ and there is a vertical homotopy between $\hat{g}(-,0):Y\to E$ and $g_0$. The synonymous expression _weak homotopy lifting property_ (WHLP) is also used. 

A continuous map is a **Dold fibration** if it has the WCHP for all spaces. Somewhat surprisingly, there is an equivalent condition in terms of delayed homotopies. A __delayed homotopy__ is a homotopy $H:Y\times I\to Z$ such that $H(y,t)=H(y,0)$ for $0\leq t\leq t_0$ for some $t_0\gt 0$.
A continuous map is a Dold fibration iff in the diagram above in which $g$ is a delayed homotopy, can be filled with a diagonal map $\hat{g}:Y\times I \to E$ such that the diagram is strictly commutative. It is of course not required that $\hat{g}$ be delayed (one can require, but then one allows $t_0$ for $\hat{g}$ to be possibly smaller than $t_0$ for $g$). This is sometimes called the __delayed homotopy lifting property__.

[[David Roberts]]:  Can we come up with a counterexample of a Serre fibration that isn't a Dold fibration? I'll ask on MathOverflow.

###### Proposition


Not all Dold fibrations are [[Serre fibration]]s.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Here is a very simple counter-example due to Dold. Consider the union of line segments
$$
E:= [-1,0]\times\{2\} \cup \{0\}\times [1,2] \cup [0,1]\times\{1\}
$$
in $\mathbf{R}^2$, and the map projecting on to the first coordinate, $pr_1:E \to [-1,1]$. Then this map is a Dold fibration but not a Serre fibration.

=--

One could consider maps that have the WCHP for just cubes -- these are a sort of hybrid Dold--Serre fibration (warning! nonstandard terminology. I just made it up, suggestions appreciated). For these maps there exists a [[long exact sequence]] in homotopy once basepoints are chosen. For classes of maps determined by (homotopy) lifting properties, this is about the minimum one needs to define such a long exact sequence. On the other hand, [[quasifibration|quasifibrations]] give rise to a long exact sequence in homotopy, but are defined by homotopy properties of the fibres.

## Examples

###### Observation

Every [[shrinkable]] map is a Dold fibration.

=--

This result follows from a theorem of Dold about [[locally homotopy trivial map]]s being the same as Dold fibrations. It should be obvious that a shrinkable map is globally homotopy trivial, with trivial fibre.

###### Corollary

Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a [[numerable open cover]]. Let $C(\{U_i\})$ the [[Cech nerve]] (a [[simplicial object]] in [[topological space]]s) and $|C(\{U_i\})| \in Top$ its [[geometric realization]]. Then the canonical map

$$
  |C(\{U_i\})| \to X
$$

is shrinkable, hence a Dold fibration.

This observation is due to Segal. See [[shrinkable map]].
