## Idea 

A _monoidal model category_ is a [[model category]] which is also a [[closed monoidal category]] in a compatible way.  In particular, its [[homotopy category]] inherits a closed monoidal structure.


## Definition 

A (symmetric) **monoidal model category** is a category equipped with 

* the structure of a  [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal category]] 

* the structure of a [[model category]];

such that

* the [[pushout-product axiom]] is satisfied, and

* For any cofibrant object $X$, the map $Q e \otimes X \to e\otimes X \cong X$ is a weak equivalence, where $e$ is the unit object of the monoidal structure and $Q e\to e$ is a cofibrant [[resolution]] for it.  This is automatically satisfied if $e$ is cofibrant, as it is in most (but not all) cases.

## Properties 

The central fact about a monoidal model category is that its [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] inherits a closed [[monoidal category]] structure.

## Examples 

### Classical homotopy theory

* A [[nice category of spaces|nice category of topological spaces]] with cartesian product and the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]].

* The category of [[simplicial sets]] with cartesian product and the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].

* The [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]] or pointed simplicial sets with the [[smash product]] of pointed objects.

### Homological algebra and stable homotopy theory

* The category of [[chain complex]]es with the usual [[tensor product]] of chain complexes and the [[model structure on chain complexes|projective model structure]].

With respect to a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]:

* the [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

* the [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

* the [[model structure for excisive functors]]

([Schwede-Shipley 00](#SchwedeShipley00), [MMSS 00, theorem 12.1 (iii) with prop. 12.3](#MMSS00))

The standard example of a monoidal model category whose unit is not cofibrant is the category of EKMM S-modules.

### Categorical model structures

* The category [[Cat]] with cartesian product and the [[folk model structure]].

* The category [[Gray]] of [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]] with the [[Gray tensor product]] and the [[model structure on 2-categories|Lack model structure]].



### Model structure on $G$-objects

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Assumption

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a [[category]] equipped with the structure of

* a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]];

* a [[monoidal model category]];

such that

* the model structure is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]];

* the tensor unit $I$ is cofibrant.

###### Proposition

Under these conditions there is for each [[finite group]] $G$ the structure of a [[monoidal model category]] on the category $\mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{B}G}$ of objects in $\mathcal{E}$ equipped with a $G$-[[action]], for which the [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{B}G} \to \mathcal{E}
$$

preserves and reflects fibrations and weak equivalences.
