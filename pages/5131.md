This page describes aspects of the combinatorics of [[product]]s of [[simplicial set]]s.

## Properties

For $X$ some [[simplicial set]] $x \in X_p$ some $p$-cell and 
for $\mu = (\mu_1, \mu_2, \cdots, \mu_q)$ a sequence of natural numbers in $\{0, \cdots p+q\}$, write

$$
  s_\mu : X_p \to X_{p+q}
$$

###### Proposition

The non-degenerate simplices in the [[product]] $\Delta[p] \times\Delta[q]$ are precisely those of the form $(s_\mu x , s_\nu y)$ for $(\mu,\nu)$ a $(p,q)$-[[shuffle]] and $x, y$ non-degenerate simplices in $\Delta[p]$ and $\Delta[q]$, respectively.

## Exposition: Shuffles and products of simplices

[[shuffle|Shuffles]] are interesting combinatorial structures but the reason why they come into many constructions in [[homotopy theory]] and [[higher category theory]] is because of their relationship with the structure of [[product]]s.

The definition of the product, $K\times L$, of [[simplicial set]]s $K$ and $L$ gives that $(K\times L)_k$ is defined to be $K_k\times L_k$ with face and degeneracy maps defined 'componentwise' so, for instance, $d_i(x,y) = (d_i x,d_i y)$.  This means that a [[simplex]] $(s_\alpha x, s_\beta y)$ can be non-degenerate even though its two components are degenerate.  Of course, this happens exactly when $\alpha \cap \beta = \emptyset$.  (Here we mean by $s_\alpha$ the composite, in order,  of the $s_i$ for $i \in \alpha$.)

In particular, take $K = \Delta[p]$ and $L= \Delta[q]$ with $x_p \in \Delta[p]_p$, $y_q \in \Delta[q]_q$, the 'identity' simplices that generate them.  (We will use an _ad hoc_ notation here, since the more obvious, $\iota_p$, and  $\iota_q$, would not distinguish the two simplices sufficiently in some formulae.)  There are, then,  non-degenerate simplices of dimension $p+q$, but none of higher dimension in $\Delta[p]\times \Delta[q]$.  These are of the form $(s_\alpha x_p,s_\beta y_q)$, where $\#\alpha = q$, $\#\beta = p$.



### Non-degenerate simplices in a product 


If we represent a vertex of a product by a 'column vector' rather than the more usual 'row vector' for the moment, then any non-degenerate $(p+q)$-simplex of $\Delta[p]\times \Delta[q]$ can be represented in the form of an ordered list of vertices,

$$\left(\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
0& \ldots & 0 & 1 & \ldots & 1 & 2 & \ldots & p\\
0& \ldots & i & i & \ldots & j & j & \ldots & q
\end{array}\right),$$

with $p + q + 1 $ columns.  The top row, which is a simplex  in $\Delta[p]$, changes at exactly those positions at which the bottom row repeats.  The top row gives a degenerate $p+q$ simplex of $\Delta[p]$, whilst the bottom row one of $\Delta[q]$, i.e., the array gives $(s_\alpha x_p, s_\beta y_q)$ for some $(\alpha, \beta)$  as above.

### Illustrative example 

The usual illustrative example is of the three 3-simplices of $\Delta[2]\times \Delta[1]$:

1. $\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0&1&2&2\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right)$, 

1. $\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0&1&1&2\\0&0&1&1\end{array}\right)$, 

1. $\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0&0&1&2\\0&1&1&1\end{array}\right)$

with, for 1), $\alpha = (2)$, $\beta = (1,0)$; for 2) $\alpha = (1)$, $\beta = (2,0)$; and, for 3), $\alpha = (0)$, $\beta = (2,1)$.


### Simplices of the product and partitions

Each such simplex yields a partition of $\{0, \ldots, p+q-1\}$ into two disjoint sets,
 $\mu_1\lt\ldots \lt\mu_p$, and $\nu_1 \lt \ldots \lt \nu_q$, and vice versa. Suppose that we have an array, as above, written

 $$\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
i_0& i_1&\ldots & i_{p+q}\\
j_0& j_1 & \ldots & j_{p+q}
\end{array}\right),$$

with $0= i_0 \leq i_1 \leq \ldots \leq i_{p+q}= p$, then if $i_k = i_{k+1}$, we put $k$ into the second set, otherwise $k$ is put in the first set.  This, of course, leads to an operation that preserves order. For instance, in the above example 2., the $i$-sequence is $(0,1,1,2)$, so there is the single repeat with $k = 1$, and $\nu = \{1\}$. 

We likewise require $0= j_0 \leq j_1 \leq \ldots \leq j_{p+q}= p$, and put $k$ into the first set if  $j_k = j_{k+1}$.  For the example, we have the $j$-sequence is $(0,0,1,1)$, so $\mu = \{ 0,2\}$.  Of course, from the partition you can get the sequences and conversely. The attentive reader will, of course, have noted that, for example 2., the $\alpha$, we specified was exactly the $\nu$, and the $\beta$ was the $\mu$.  This is general with the simplex corresponding to a partition, $(\mu,\nu)$,  being given by $(s_{\nu_q}\ldots s_{\nu_1}x_p,s_{\mu_p}\ldots s_{\mu_1}y_q)$.

Each such partition defines a permutation of $\{0,\ldots, p+q-1 \}$.  Let us write $\iota_0 : \{ 0, \ldots, q-1\}\to \{0, \ldots, p+q-1\}$ for the order preserving function $\iota_0 (r)= p+r$, whilst $\iota_1 : \{ 0, \ldots, p-1\}\to \{0, \ldots, p+q-1\}$ will denote the inclusion, so $\iota_1(r) = r$. There will be a permutation  $\sigma$ of $\{0,\ldots, p+q-1 \}$ such that $\sigma \iota_0(r) = \nu_{r+1}$ and $\sigma\iota_1(r) = \mu_{r+1}$. This means that the permutation looks like  

$$\sigma =\left(\begin{array}{ccccccccc}0&1&2& \ldots & p-1&p&p+1& \ldots & p+q-1\\
\mu_1&\mu_2&\mu_3&\ldots & \mu_p&\nu_1&\nu_2&\ldots &\nu_q\end{array}\right).$$

We can thus assign  a sign, $sgn(\sigma)$, to each such shuffle, namely the sign of the corresponding permutation.  

For our standard examples, we have : 1) $\sigma$ is the identity, 2) $\sigma = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&1&2\\0&2&1\end{array}\right)$, i.e. the transposition exchanging 1 and 2,  and for 3) $\sigma = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&1&2\\1&2&0\end{array}\right)$, a 3-cycle. 
We thus have, in this case, the signs are +1, -1, and  + 1, respectively.


### Paths in the product 


A final useful interpretation of $(p,q)$ shuffles is of ascending paths through a $p$ by $q$ integer lattice from $(0,0)$ to $(p,q)$.  This is quite well illustrated by our example.  The vertices are the integer pairs, $(i,j)$ with $0\leq i\leq p$ and $0\leq j\leq q$, so in our case we get

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\xymatrix{(0,1)\ar@{-}[r]\ar@{-}[d]%26(1,1)\ar@{-}[r]\ar@{-}[d]%26(2,1)\ar@{-}[d]\\(0,0)\ar@{-}[r]%26(1,0)\ar@{-}[r]%26(2,0)}"/>

The path corresponding to a $(p,q)$-shuffle just follows the list of (transposed pairs of) vertices, so, for instance, 2) goes  

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\xymatrix{%26(1,1)\ar@{-}[r]\ar@{-}[d]%26(2,1)\\	(0,0)\ar@{-}[r]%26(1,0)%26}"/>

###The poset of $(p,q)$-shuffles###

Any pair $(p,q)$ yields a [[poset]] relating the various $(p,q)$-shuffles.  

Our $(2,1)$-example is really too simple and small to illustrate this well, but the two cases $(3,1)$ and $(2,2)$ do a much better job, but even so we first look at the (2,1) example:


<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\xymatrix{(0<1)\ar@{-}[r]%26(0<2)\ar@{-}[r]%26(1<2).}"/>

(This [[Hasse diagram]] has been laid out horizontally to save space.  The bottom is to the left.)
 
We need here to explain the partial order.  We take the $\mu$-signature' of the shuffle, that is, the ordered set $\mu_1\lt\ldots \lt \mu_p$. (Of course, this determines the $\nu$-signature as that is the complement of $\mu$.)

######Definition######
Given two $(p,q)$-shuffles, represented by $(\mu, \nu)$ and $(\mu^\prime,\nu^\prime)$, we set 

$$(\mu, \nu) \leq (\mu^\prime,\nu^\prime)$$

if, for each $i$ in the range $1\leq i\leq p$, $\mu_i \leq \mu_i^\prime.$  We refer to this poset as $(Shuff_{(p,q)},\leq)$.
