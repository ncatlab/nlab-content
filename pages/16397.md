## Idea 

**Derived Morita equivalence** is a generalization of [[Morita equivalence]] to the "derived" context ([[homotopy theory]] of [[dg-algebras]]). Just as two $k$-[[associative algebra|algebras]] are Morita equivalent if and only if their [[category of modules|categories of left modules]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], the coarser equivalence relation of derived Morita equivalence holds whenever for two [[differential graded algebras]] their (bounded) [[derived categories]] [[category of modules|of modules]], along with their [[triangulated category]] structure, are equivalent.

## Examples

A derived Morita equivalence in the context of [[homological mirror symmetry]] appears in ([Okada 09](#Okada09))
