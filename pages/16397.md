##Idea 

**Derived Morita equivalence** is a generalization of [[Morita equivalence]] to the derived context. Just as two $k$-algebras are Morita equivalent if and only if their categories of left modules are equivalent, the coarser equivalence relation of derived Morita equivalence holds whenever for two [[differential graded algebras]] their (bounded) derived categories of modules, along with their triangulated structure, are equivalent.
