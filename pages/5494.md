## Idea

The _unordered pair_ of $x$ and $y$, denoted $\{x,y\}$, has the property that $\{x_1,y_1\} = \{x_2,y_2\}$ if and only if $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$ or $x_1 = y_2$ and $y_1 = x_2$.  In other words, the unordered pair $\{x,y\}$ is the same as the _[[ordered pair]]_ $(x,y)$, except that presentation order does not matter.

A more transparent terminology calls an unordered pair a _pair set_, which allows a _pair_ to unambiguously be an ordered pair (as is usual in current usage), however the _ordered/unordered_ distinction is well entrenched in the literature.


## Definition

Unordered pairs are commonly defined as [[subsets]], as follows:

If $A$ is a [[set]] and $x$ and $y$ are [[elements]] of $A$, then the __unordered pair__ or __pair set__ $\{x,y\}$ is the [[subset]] of $A$ with the property that $z \in \{x,y\}$ if and only if $z = x$ or $z = y$.  Note that $\{x,x\} = \{x\}$, a [[singleton]].

In [[material set theory]], we may apply this when $x$ and $y$ are not previously given as elements of any set $A$.  In that case, the existence of the unordered pair is given by the [[axiom of pairing]].

The set of all unordered pairs of elements of $A$ may be denoted $\big(\!\big({A \atop 2}\big)\!\big)$.  [[classical mathematics|Classically]] (using [[excluded middle]]), $\big(\!\big({A \atop 2}\big)\!\big)$ is the internal [[disjoint union]] $\big({A \atop 1}\big) \uplus \big({A \atop 2})$; in other words, every unordered pair is either a $1$-element set (a [[singleton]]) or a $2$-element set.


## Relation to ordered pairs

The unordered pair $\{x,y\}$ should not be confused with the [[ordered pair]] $(x,y)$.  In particular, $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, while $(x,y) \neq (y,x)$ (if $x \neq y$).  In [[material set theory]], $\{x,y\}$ has a direct definition, but $(x,y)$ must be coded in a complicated way (traditionally as $\big\{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\big\}$).  On the other hand, ordered pairs are more natural in [[structural set theory]].

However, the two are somewhat related:

*  As just seen, the usual encoding of an ordered pair of [[pure sets]] as a pure set (due to Kuratowski) involves unordered pairs.  Conversely, the set $\big(\!\big({A \atop 2}\big)\!\big)$ of unordered pairs of elements of $A$ may be constructed as a [[quotient set]] of the set $A^2$ of ordered pairs of elements of $A$ (by the [[equivalence relation]] generated by declaring that $(x,y) \sim (y,x)$).
*  Just as unordered pairs (through the [[axiom of pairing]]) are needed to get anywhere in material set theory, so some axiom related to ordered pairs is needed to get anywhere in [[structural set theory]].  (In [[ETCS]], this is the axiom of the ([[Cartesian product|Cartesian]]) [[product]]; in [[SEAR]], this is the axiom of tabulations.)

The term '[[pairing]]' in the $n$Lab usually refers to *ordered* pairs.
