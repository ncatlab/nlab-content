## Idea

What is called the _bullet cluster_ is a pair of colliding [[galaxy clusters]] observed at a distance of about 3.7 billion [[light-years]].

The bullet cluster stands out in that comparison of its distribution of visible matter and non-visible gravitating matter seems to show that the centers of mass of the two components are separating during the collision. This has famously been interpreted as a strong indirect evidence for the [[dark matter]] hypothesis.
