## Idea ##

The [[simplex category]] may be regarded as the category of all linear directed graphs. The _tree category_ generalizes this to directed rooted trees.

## Definition ##

The objects of $\Omega$ are non-empty non-planar [[tree]]s with specified root. 

Each such tree may naturally be regarded as specifying an (colored) [[operad]] with one color per edge of the tree. A morphism of trees in $\Omega$ is a morphism of the corresponding operads. 

As such, $\Omega$ is by construction a full subcategory of that of [[operad]]s.,

## Dendroidal sets ##

A [[presheaf]] on $\Omega$ is a [[dendroidal set]], a generalization of a [[simplicial set]].
