For extensions in the sense of "added structure" see at _[[group extension]]_, _[[Lie algebra extension]]_, _[[infinitesimal extension]]_ etc. In [[foundations]] and [[formal logic]]  there is also [[extension (semantics)]] and [[context extension]].

## Idea

### Extension of morphisms

The __extension of a morphism__ $f: A\to Y$ along a monomorphism $i: A\hookrightarrow X$ is a morphism $\tilde{f}:X\to Y$ such that $\tilde{f}\circ i = f$. One sometimes, extends along more general morphisms than monomorphisms. 

The dual problem is the problem of [[lifting]] a morphism $p: Y\to B$ along an epimorphism (or more general map) $f:X\to B$ to become a morphism $\tilde{f}: Y\to X$ such that $f = p\circ\tilde{f}$.

### Extension of an object by another object 

In a [[category]] $C$ with a notion of [[short exact sequence]] (e.g. any [[semiabelian category]], [[Quillen exact category]] etc.) an **extension** of an object $X$ by an object $Y$ is any object $Z$ fitting in a short exact sequence

$$ 
X \stackrel{i}\hookrightarrow Z\stackrel{p}\rightarrowtail Y
$$


Classification of extensions in many categories is obtained using a [[forgetful functor]] $C\to D$ to a simpler category $D$, which preserves short exact sequences. For example, if all extensions in $D$ are isomorphic to $X\coprod Y$, then one looks for an additional structure in $C$ needed to equip the coproduct $X\coprod Y$ with a structure of an object in $C$ such that the $i$ and $p$ are morphisms in
$C$ making above a short exact sequence in $C$.

### Other notions of extension

* [[extension (semantics)]]

* [[context extension]]

## Examples 

### Extension of functions


The [[Tietze extension theorem]] is about *extensions of continuous maps* from a subspace to a normal toplogical space. 


### Group extensions

For example, in the category [[Grp]] of (possibly nonabelian) groups one has a short exact sequence usually denoted $1\to X\to Z\to Y\to 1$ corresponding to a [[group extension]].
