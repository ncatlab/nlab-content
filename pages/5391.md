In a category $C$ with a notion of [[short exact sequence]] (e.g. any [[semiabelian category]], [[Quillen exact category]] etc.) an extension of an object $X$ by an object $Y$ is any object $Z$ fitting in a short exact sequence

$$ 
X \stackrel{i}\to Z\stackrel{p}\to Y
$$

For example, in the category of (possibly nonabelian) groups one has a short exact sequence usually denoted $1\to X\to Z\to Y\to 1$. 

Classification of extensions in many categories is obtained using a forgetful functor $C\to D$ to a simpler category $D$, which preserves short exact sequences. For example, if all extensions in $D$ are isomorphic to $X\coprod Y$, then one looks for an additional structure in $C$ needed to equip the coproduct $X\coprod Y$ with a structure of an object in $C$ such that the $i$ and $p$ are morphisms in
$C$ making above a short exact sequence in $C$.
