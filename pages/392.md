The mathematical **red herring principle** is the principle that in [[mathematics]], a "red herring" need not, in general, be either red or a herring.

Frequently, in fact, it is conversely true that all herrings are red herrings.  This often leads to mathematicians speaking of "non-red herrings," and sometimes even to a redefinition of "herring" to include both the red and non-red versions.

### Notes ### 

* Clearly, the term "red herring" here is not to be confused with the usual meaning, which typically refers to a deliberate attempt to divert or throw one off track, as for example a rhetorical tactic for this purpose, or a novelistic device. 

* It should also not be thought that "red herring" as used here signals a pejorative, indicating for example ineptitude or lack of care in naming. For example, it may be that "foo" once meant a "bar", but over time the meaning of "foo" changed, so that while "weak $*$-foo" might seem strange if "foo" is taken in the modern sense, it made much better sense under the older (but mostly forgotten) meaning of "foo". 

Thus, "red herring" as used here is to be interpreted neutrally: it refers to a name of a concept which might throw the reader off-track, by accident as it were. 

### Examples ###

* A [[manifold with boundary]] is not a [[manifold]].  This leads to the use of "manifold without boundary."

* A nonassociative algebra is not an algebra in the usual sense used in [[linear algebra]]. This leads to the use of "[[associative algebra]]". What\'s worse, a "nonassociative algebra" *might* happen to be associative; it just doesn\'t *have* to be!

* A noncommutative [[ring]] may or may not be a ring, depending on one's definition (algebraic geometers frequently take "ring" to imply commutativity).  Like a nonassociative algebra, a noncommutative ring might happen to be commutative.

  * Accordingly, [[noncommutative geometry]] is really about _not necessarily commutative_ or _possibly non-commutative_ geometry. In fact, many tools developed in "non-commutative geometry" are useful tools in just commutative geometry.

* A [[weak factorization system]] is not a factorization system, as originally defined, but rather the reverse.  This has led to the use of [[orthogonal factorization system]] in place of "factorization system."

* Originally, [[n-category]] referred only to the strict version, so that a "weak $n$-category" was not an $n$-category.  Nowadays some people (including many authors of the nLab)  are trying to reverse this, so that $n$-category means the weak version, while the strict version needs an adjective added.  Likewise for related concepts such as [[2-limit]] and [[strict 2-limit]].

* A [[star-autonomous category|*-autonomous category]] is not an [[autonomous category]], but the reverse is almost true: a *symmetric* autonomous (a.k.a. compact closed) category is a fairly special case of a $*$-autonomous one.

* A [[linearly distributive category]] has essentially nothing to do with a [[distributive category]].

* If a [[localizer]] refers to a class of maps in a [[presheaf category]], as it sometimes does, then a [[basic localizer]], being a class of maps in [[Cat]], is not a localizer.
