Let $\sim$ be the relation of being homotopic (for example in the category $Top$). Let $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to X$ be two morphisms. We say that $g$ is a **left homotopy inverse** to $f$ or that $f$ is a **right homotopy inverse** to $g$ if $g\circ f\sim id_X$. A **homotopy inverse** of $f$ is a map which is simultaneously a left and a right homotopy inverse to $f$. 

$f$ is said to be a homotopy equivalence if it has a left and a right homotopy inverse. In that case we can choose the left and right homotopy inverses of $f$ to be equal. To show this denote by $g_L$ the left and by $g_R$ the right homotopy inverse of $f$. Then

$$ g_L \sim g_L\circ (f\circ g_R) = (g_L\circ f)\circ g_R \sim g_R. $$

Hence

$$ f\circ g_L\sim f\circ g_R\sim id_X, $$

therefore $g_L$ is not only a left, but also a right, homotopy inverse to $f$. 

This makes sense in any category equipped with an equivalence relation $\sim$, which is compatible with the composition (and with the equality of morphisms).
