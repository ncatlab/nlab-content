## Idea

What may be called **$E_\infty$-geometry**, or **spectral algebraic geometry** is the "full" version of [[derived algebraic geometry]] where the spaces are locally modelled on [[E-infinity rings]] (as opposed to [[simplicial commutative rings]] or [[dg-algebras]]).

(In view of existing terms "[[arithmetic geometry]]" and "[[higher geometry]]" one might also tend call this **higher  [[arithmetic geometry]]**,but notice that the term _[[higher arithmetic geometry]]_ already has a different traditional usage. Maybe **$E_\infty$-arithmetic geometry** works well.)

That is to say, it is the [[higher geometry]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] over the [[(∞,1)-site]] of [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of [[E-∞ rings]], equipped with the [[etale topology]].

An [[E-∞ scheme]] ( _spectral scheme_ ) in this sense is a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] in $E_\infty$-geometry.

## Terminology

The term _spectral algebraic geometry_ is used in the literature.  On the [[nLab]] we use the term _$E_\infty$-geometry_ due to a possible terminology clash discussed at [[spectral geometry]].

## Properties

### Higher analogs of Fermat derivations and Frobenius maps

The refinement to $E_\infty$-arithmetic geometry of the power map $(-)^p$ which gives the [[Fermat quotient]] [[p-derivation]] and the [[Frobenius homomorphism]] in plain [[arithmetic geometry]] is the [[power operations]] on [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] ([Lurie "Adic", remark 2.2.9](#LurieAdic)).
