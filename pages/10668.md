## Idea

**$E_\infty$-geometry**, or **spectral algebraic geometry** or maybe **[[higher geometry|higher]] [[arithmetic geometry]]**, is the "full" version of [[derived algebraic geometry]] where the spaces are locally modelled on [[E-infinity rings]] (as opposed to [[simplicial commutative rings]] or [[dg-algebras]]).

That is to say, it is the [[higher geometry]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] over the [[(∞,1)-site]] of [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of [[E-∞ rings]], equipped with the [[etale topology]].

An [[E-∞ scheme]] ( _spectral scheme_ ) in this sense is a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] in $E_\infty$-geometry.

## Terminology

The term _spectral algebraic geometry_ is used in the literature.  On the [[nLab]] we use the term _$E_\infty$-geometry_ due to a possible terminology clash discussed at [[spectral geometry]].
