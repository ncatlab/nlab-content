## Idea

What is called the _Lambda algebra_ ($\Lambda$-algebra) in [[stable homotopy theory]] is a [[differential graded algebra]] over $\mathbb{F}_2$ whose [[chain homology]] is the second page of the [[classical Adams spectral sequence]].

It has the advantage over the [[May spectral sequence]] that it tends to make the [extension proplem](spectral+sequence#ExtensionProblem) for the Adams spectral sequence more tractable ([Kochman 96, corollary 5.2.8](#Kochman96))
