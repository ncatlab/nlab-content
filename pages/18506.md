##Idea

A **Clifford–Klein form** is a [[double coset space]] $\Gamma \backslash G/H$, where $G$ is a [[Lie group]], $H$ a [[closed subspace|closed]] subgroup of $G$, and $\Gamma$ a discrete subgroup of $G$ that acts properly discontinuously and freely on the [[homogeneous space]] $G/H$. 

##Related concepts
