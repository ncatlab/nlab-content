## Idea ##

The _Karoubi envelope_ of a [[category]] is the universal way to ensure that every [[idempotent]] is a [[split idempotent]].  It is the [[Set]]-enriched version of _[[Cauchy completion]]_.

A category in which all idempotents split is called *Karoubi complete* or *Cauchy complete* or *idempotent-complete*.  Thus, the Karoubi envelope is a [[completion]] operation into such categories.

## Definition ## 

Let $C$ be a [[category]]. We give an elementary construction of the __Karoubi envelope__ $\bar{C}$ which formally splits [[idempotents]] in $C$. 


The objects of $\bar{C}$ are pairs $(c, e: c \to c)$ where $e$ is an idempotent on an object $c$ of $C$. Morphisms $(c, e) \to (d, f)$ are morphisms $\phi: c \to d$ in $C$ such that $f \circ \phi = \phi = \phi \circ e$. NB: the identity on $(c, e)$ in $\bar{C}$ is the morphism $e: c \to c$. 


There is a functor 

$$E: C \to \bar{C}$$ 

which maps an object $c$ to $(c, 1_c)$. This functor is [[fully faithful functor|full and faithful]]: it fully embeds $C$ in $\bar{C}$. If $e: c \to c$ is an idempotent in $C$, then in $\bar{C}$ there are maps 

$$p: (c, 1_c) \to (c, e), \, j: (c, e) \to (c, 1_c),$$ 

both given by $e: c \to c$. It is clear that $p \circ j$ is the identity $e: (c, e) \to (c, e)$, and that $j \circ p$ is the idempotent $E(e): E(c) \to E(c)$. Thus the pair $(p, j)$ formally splits the idempotent $e: c \to c$. The same argument shows that every idempotent $\phi: (c, e) \to (c, e)$ in $\bar{C}$ splits. Actually this formal construction does more: it gives a _choice_ of splitting for every idempotent. 


Let $D$ be any category in which every idempotent $h: d \to d$ has a chosen splitting $(p_h: d \to d_h, j_h: d_h \to d)$ (using identities to split identities), and let $F: C \to D$ be a functor. Define an extension 

$$\bar{F}: \bar{C} \to D$$ 

by sending $(c, e: c \to c)$ to the underlying object $F(c)_{F(e)}$ of the splitting of $F(e): F(c) \to F(c)$ in $D$. For morphisms $\phi: (c, e) \to (c', e')$, define $\bar{F}(\phi)$ to be the composite 

$$F(c)_{F(e)} \overset{F(j_{F(e)})}{\to} F(c) \overset{F(\phi)}{\to} F(c') \overset{F(p_{F(e')})}{\to} F(c')_{F(e')}$$ 

Then $\bar{F}$ is the unique extension of $F$ which preserves chosen splittings. Thus the Karoubi envelope is universal among functors from $C$ into categories $D$ in which every idempotent has a chosen splitting. 


If $D$ is a category in which every idempotent splits, then we can choose a splitting for each idempotent using the [[axiom of choice]] (AC); the extension $\bar{F}$ depends on how we do this but is unique up to unique [[natural isomorphism]].  Alternatively, we can define $\bar{F}$ as an [[anafunctor]]; then no AC is needed, and we still have $\bar{F}$ unique up to unique natural isomorphism.  (It is key here that a splitting of an idempotent is unique up to a coherent isomorphism.)
