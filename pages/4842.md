# Vassiliev knot invariants

## Idea ##

The space of knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or $S^3$) is an open submanifold of the [[smooth loop space]].  Knot invariants are locally constant functions on this manifold.  The complement of the space of knots is called the [[discriminant]] and consists of all [[singular knots]].

If we consider those singular knots with only a finite number of double points, we can build a [[cubical complex]] from this data.  The vertices in the complex are labelled by the isotopy classes of knots, and more generally the $n$-cubes by the isotopy classes of singular knots with $n$ double points (and a few other technical pieces of information).  The boundary operator resolves a double crossing either upwards or downwards according to the orientation at the crossing.

A **Vassiliev invariant** is simply a cubical morphism from this complex to an abelian group that vanishes above a certain degree.

## Definition ##

One does not need the language of cubical complexes to _define_ Vassiliev invariants.  Rather, there is a general method whereby a [[knot invariant]] can be extended to all [[singular knots]] with only finitely many double points (and no other singularities) using the [[Vassiliev skein relations]].

###### Definition
A **Vassiliev invariant** of degree (or order) $\le n$ is a knot invariant whose extension to singular knots (with double points) vanishes on all singular knots with more than $n$ double points.
=--

As is standard, it is of degree $n$ if it is of degree $\le n$ but not $\le n - 1$.  Vassiliev invariants are also called **finite type invariants**.


## Remarks ##

The degree of Vassiliev invariants defines a filtration on the space of knots (and more particularly, on the [[algebra of knots]]).  Two knots are $n$-equivalent if all the Vassiliev invariants of degree $\le n$ agree on them.  In particular, a knot that is $n$-equivalent to the unknot is said to be $n$-trivial.

## Examples ##

1. The $n$th coefficient of the Conway polynomial is a Vassiliev invariant of order $\le n$.
