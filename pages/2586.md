The __spin group__ $Spin(n)$ is the [[universal covering space]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$. By the usual arguments it inherits a group structure for which the operations are smooth and so is a [[Lie group]] like $SO(n)$.

The name arises due to the requirement that the structure group of the [[tangent bundle]] of [[spacetime]] lifts to $Spin(n)$ so as to 'define particles with spin'... (Someone more awake and focused please put this into proper words!)
