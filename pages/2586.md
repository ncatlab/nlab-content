The __spin group__ $Spin(n)$ is the [[universal covering space]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$. By the usual arguments it inherits a group structure for which the operations are smooth and so is a [[Lie group]] like $SO(n)$.

The Spin group is one element in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$, which starts out like

$$
  \cdots \to Fivebrane(n)
  \to String(n) \to Spin(n)
  \to SO(n)
  \to O(n)
$$

[[Fivebrane group]] $\to$ [[String group]] $\to$ Spin group $\to$ [[special orthogonal group]] to [[orthogonal group]].

#Spin group in physics#

The name arises due to the requirement that the structure group of the [[tangent bundle]] of [[spacetime]] lifts to $Spin(n)$ so as to 'define particles with spin'... (Someone more awake and focused please put this into proper words!)
