## Idea

_Extensional type theory is_ the flavor of [[type theory]] in which [[function extensionality]] holds by identities: two [[terms]] $f, g$ of [[function types]] are identified if all their values agree, if $\forall x, f(x) = g(x)$.

If this distinction is not made, one speaks of [[intensional type theory]]. If, however, the [[univalence axiom]] is added to intensional type theory -- to obtain [[homotopy type theory]] -- then function extensionality holds again, but only by [[equivalence]].

## Properties

### Decidibility

Only the intensional but not the [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[Martin-Löf type theory]] is [[decidable]]. See _[[intensional type theory]]_ for more on this.
