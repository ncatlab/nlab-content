In [[enriched model category]] theory, an __enriched Quillen adjunction__ is an adjunction in the sense of [[enriched category theory]] whose underlying ordinary adjunction is a [[Quillen adjunction]] between ordinary [[model categories]].

Here "underlying" refers to the underlying ordinary category $C_0$ of any $V$-enriched category, defined by $C_0(x,y) = V(I,C(x,y))$.  (Recall that an enriched model category is an enriched category, together with a model structure on its underlying ordinary category, and some compatibility conditions.)
