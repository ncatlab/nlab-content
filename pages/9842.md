
__Euclid__ (Εὐκλείδης), or Euclid of Alexandria to remove some possible ambiguity, was an ancient Greek mathematician who authored the _Elements_, a treatise consisting of thirteen books covering plane and solid geometry, arithmetic (elementary number theory), and irrational numbers. He is regarded as preeminent organizer of the mathematics of the ancient Hellenistic world, and his work exerted a decisive influence, through the centuries to come, on the understanding and cultural image of mathematics as a rigorous deductive discipline. 

There is little hard data on Euclid as a person; it seems to be generally agreed that he worked and taught at the library at Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (*circa* 300 BC), having earlier received his training in mathematics from students of Plato at Plato’s Academy in Athens.

One could thus say, partly in jest, that Euclid was the ancient Hellenistic version of [[Bourbaki]], except that Euclid is usually regarded as a real person. Somewhat more seriously, one could fairly say that Bourbaki, quite consciously, fancies and presents himself as a modern-day Euclid, collecting and reorganizing the mathematics of the day in rigorous logical form. (The naming of Bourbaki's _magnum opus_, the Elements of Mathematics, is of course no coincidence.) One notable stylistic difference: Euclid freely employed pictures as visual aids to the logical demonstrations in the Elements, whereas Bourbaki writes his Elements in rather a puritanical spirit, sternly forbidding the use of pictorial representations.
