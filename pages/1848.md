## Idea

A [[space]] (such as a [[topological space]]) is _second-countable_ if, in a certain sense, there is only a [[countable set|countable]] amount of information globally in its topology.  (Change 'globally' to 'locally' to get a [[first-countable space]].)


## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[topological space]] is __second-countable__ if it has a [[countable set|countable]] [[topological basis|basis]] $B$.

###### Definition

A [[locale]] is __second-countable__ if there is a [[countable set]] $B$ of [[open subspaces]] (elements of the [[frame of opens]]) such that every open $G$ is a [[join]] of some [[subset]] of $B$.  That is, we have
$$ G = \bigvee \{ U\colon B \;|\; U \subseteq G \} .$$

## Generalisations

The __weight__ of a space is the [[minimum]] of the [[cardinalities]] of the possible bases $B$.  We are implicitly using the [[axiom of choice]] here, to suppose that this set of cardinalities (which really is a [[small set]] because bounded above by the number of open subspaces, and [[inhabited set|inhabited]] by this number as well) has a minimum.  But without Choice, we can still consider this collection of cardinalities.

Then a second-countable space is simply one with a countable weight.


## Examples

A [[compact space|compact]] [[metric space]] is second-countable. A [[separable space|separable]] metric space is second-countable. (It is *not* true that separable [[first-countable spaces]] are second-countable; a counterexample is the [[real line]] equipped with the half-open or lower limit topology that has as basis the collection of half-open intervals $[a, b)$.) 

A [[topological manifold]] is second-countable iff it is [[paracompact space|paracompact]] and has countably many [[connected components]].

A [[countable set|countable]] [[coproduct]] of second-countable spaces is second-countable. 

If $X$ is second-countable and there is an [[open map|open]] [[surjection]] $f: X \to Y$, then $Y$ is second-countable. 

Countable [[products]] of second-countable spaces are second-countable. [[subspace|Subspaces]] of second-countable spaces are second-countable.
