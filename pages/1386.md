## Idea

As for ordinary [[sheafification]], _$(\infty,1)$-sheafification_ is the [[exact (∞,1)-functor|left exact]] [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] to the inclusion of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] into [[(∞,1)-presheaves]].

For more details see [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]].

## Properties

An $(n,1)$-presheaf can be $(n,1)$-sheafified by

* applying the [[plus-construction on presheaves]] $n+1$ times (see [Lurie, section 6.5.3](#Lurie))

* applying a single "[[hypercover]]-plus-construction" (see [DHI, theorem 7.6](#DHI))
