In [classical Galois theory for fields](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Galois+theory#ClassicalGaloisTheory) the **inverse Galois problem** is the question whether or not every [[finite group]] appears as the [[Galois group]] of some [[Galois extension]] of the [[rational number|rational numbers]].

This problem is ''inverse'' to the problem of computing the Galois group of some [[algebraic equation]]. It was first posed in the 19th century and is still unsolved. However there are several results dealing with special and related cases.
