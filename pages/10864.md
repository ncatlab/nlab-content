##  Idea

What is called _rational thermodynamics_ is a proposal ([Truesdell 72](#Truesdell72)) to base the [[physics]] of  [[irreversible thermodynamics]] on a system of [[axioms]] and derive the theory from these formally.

The success of the axioms of rational thermodynamics as a theory of physical phenomena has been subject of debate. But the idea as such that [[continuum physics]] can be and should be given a clear [[axiom|axiomatic]] [[foundation]] seems to have inspired [[William Lawvere]] (see there for more), once an undergraduate student of [[Clifford Truesdell]], to base [[continuum mechanics]] on constructions in [[topos theory]], such as [[synthetic differential geometry]] and [[cohesion]].
