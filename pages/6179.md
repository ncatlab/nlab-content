The term _S-duality_ can mean two different things:

* in [[mathematics]] it is short for _[[Spanier-Whitehead duality]]_ : [[dual object|monoidal duality]] in the [[stable homotopy category]];

* in [[physics]] it denotes a certain equivalence between [[quantum field theories]], this is what we discuss below

## Idea

In its original form, S-duality refers to **Montonen-Olive duality** , which is about the following phenomenon:

The [[Lagrangian]] of [[Yang-Mills theory]] has two summands, 

$$
  S_{YM} : \nabla \mapsto \int_X \frac{1}{e^2} \langle F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla\rangle
   + \int_{X} i \theta \langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle
  \,,
$$

each pairing the [[curvature]] 2-form with itself in an [[invariant polynomial]], but the first involving the [[Hodge star operator]] dual, and the second not. One can combine the coefficients $\frac{1}{e^2}$ and $i \theta$ into a single [[complex number]]

$$
  \tau = \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} +  \frac{4 \pi i}{e^2}
  \,.
$$

Montonen-Olive duality asserts that the quantum field theories induced from one such parameter value and another one obtained from it by an action of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ on the upper half plane are equivalent.

This is actually not quite true for ordinary Yang-Mills theory, but seems to be true for [[super Yang-Mills theory]].

[[Edward Witten]] has suggested that this is to be understood geometrically by understand Yang-Mills theory as a [[compactification]] of a conformal quantum field theory in 6-dimensions -- that instead of a [[gauge field]] given by a [[principal bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] involves a [[principal 2-bundle]] with [[connection on a 2-bundle|2-connection]] -- on a [[torus]]. The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariance of the resulting 4-dimensional theory is then the remnant of the invariance of the 6-dimensional theory under conformal transformations of that torus.

Moreover, Witten has suggested that this S-duality secretly drives a host of other subtle phenomena, notably that the [[geometric Langlands duality]] is just an aspect of a special case of this.
