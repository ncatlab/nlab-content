The term _S-duality_ can mean two different things:

* in [[mathematics]] it is short for _[[Spanier-Whitehead duality]]_ : [[dual object|monoidal duality]] in the [[stable homotopy category]];

* in [[physics]] it denotes a certain equivalence between [[quantum field theories]], this is what we discuss below

## Idea

### In (super) Yang-Mills theory

In its original form, S-duality refers to **Montonen-Olive duality** , which is about the following phenomenon:

The [[Lagrangian]] of [[Yang-Mills theory]] has two summands, 

$$
  S_{YM} : \nabla \mapsto \int_X \frac{1}{e^2} \langle F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla\rangle
   + \int_{X} i \theta \langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle
  \,,
$$

each pairing the [[curvature]] 2-form with itself in an [[invariant polynomial]], but the first involving the [[Hodge star operator]] dual, and the second not. One can combine the coefficients $\frac{1}{e^2}$ and $i \theta$ into a single [[complex number]]

$$
  \tau = \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} +  \frac{4 \pi i}{e^2}
  \,.
$$

Montonen-Olive duality asserts that the quantum field theories induced from one such parameter value and another one obtained from it by an action of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ on the upper half plane are equivalent.

This is actually not quite true for ordinary Yang-Mills theory, but seems to be true for [[super Yang-Mills theory]].

[[Edward Witten]] has suggested that this is to be understood geometrically by understand Yang-Mills theory as a [[compactification]] of a conformal quantum field theory in 6-dimensions -- that instead of a [[gauge field]] given by a [[principal bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] involves a [[principal 2-bundle]] with [[connection on a 2-bundle|2-connection]] -- on a [[torus]]. The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariance of the resulting 4-dimensional theory is then the remnant of the invariance of the 6-dimensional theory under conformal transformations of that torus.

Moreover, Witten has suggested that this S-duality secretly drives a host of other subtle phenomena, notably that the [[geometric Langlands duality]] is just an aspect of a special case of this.

### In string theory

In [[string theory]], S-duality is supposed to apply to whole string theories and make [[type II string theory]] be S-dual to itself and make  [[heterotic string theory]] be S-dual to [[type I string theory]].

#### Heterotic/type I duality

> Something substantial should go here, for the moment the following is copied from a discussion forum comment by some Olof [here](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/65546/5603):

For the Het/I relation, the first observation is that the massless spectra of the two models agree. Moreover, if we make the identification
$$\tag{1}
G^I_{\mu\nu} = e^{-\Phi_h} G^h_{\mu\nu} , \qquad
\Phi^I = - \Phi^h , \qquad
\tilde{F}^I_3 = \tilde{H}^h_3 , \qquad
A^I_1 = A^h_1
$$
the low energy effective supergravity actions of the two models match. Since the string coupling constants $g_s^I$ and $g_s^h$ are given as the expectation values of the exponentials of the dilatons $\exp(\Phi^I)$ and $\exp(\Phi^h)$, respectively, the above equations relates the type-I theory at strong coupling to the heterotic theory at weak coupling:
$$\tag{2}
g^I_s = \frac{1}{g^h_s} .
$$
From the relative scaling of the metric in (1) we also see that the string length in the two theories are related by
$$\tag{3}
l^I_s = l^h_s \sqrt{g^h_s}.
$$

As a non-perturbative check we can consider the tension of the type-I D1 brane. The brane is a BPS object, so for all values of the coupling $g_s^I$ the tension is given by the same formula
$$
T^I_{D1} = \frac{1}{g_s^I} \frac{1}{2\pi\left(l^I_s\right)^2} = \frac{g^h_s}{2\pi\left(l^h_s\sqrt{g^h_s}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2\pi\left(l^h_s\right)^2}
$$ 
where I've used relations (2) and (3). But this is equal to the tension of the fundamental heterotic string
$$
T^h_{F1} = \frac{1}{2\pi\left(l^h_s\right)^2}.
$$
This indicates that it is sensible to identify the strong coupling limit of the type-I D1 brane with the heterotic string.

#### Type IIB self-duality

In [[type IIB string theory]] S-duality mixes the [[fundamental string]] with the [[D1-brane]].

At least part of the S-duality in [[type II string theory]] can be seen as a system of autoequivalences of the [[super L-infinity algebras]] which defines the [[extended super spacetime]] constituted by the type II superstring ([FSS 13, section 4.3](#FSS13)).
