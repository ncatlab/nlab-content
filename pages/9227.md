## Idea

_Wick's lemma_ is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] formula for the product in [[associative algebras]] that appear in the context of [[free field theory]].

From the point of view of [[path integral quantization]], Wick's lemma is about the [[moments]] of [[Gaussian probability distributions]]. See at _[[Feynman diagram]]_ for more on this.


From the point of view of [[causal perturbation theory]] Wick's lemma expresses the [[Moyal deformation quantization]] of a [[free field theory]], see at _[[Wick algebra]]_ for more on this.

From the point of view of [[BV-quantization]] Wick's lemma arises as a consequence of the [[homological perturbation lemma]]  ([Gwilliam, section 2.3](#Gwilliam)).
