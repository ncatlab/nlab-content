## Idea

_Wick's lemma_ is a combinatorial formula for the [[moments]] of [[Gaussian probability distributions]].

In the context of [[quantum field theory]] Gaussian integrals appear as [[path integrals]] of free field theories and Wick's lemma provides a way to compute quantum [[observables]]. In the context of [[BV-quantization]] Wick's lemma is a consequence of the [[homological perturbation lemma]].  ([Gwilliam, section 2.3](#Gwilliam)).
