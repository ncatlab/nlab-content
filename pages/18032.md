## Idea

An [[elementary substructure]] $N \preceq M$ of a [[model]] of a [[first-order theory]] is an _ultraroot_ of $M$ if $M$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to an [[ultrapower]] of $N$.

## Definition

Formally, recall that any structure $N$ admits a diagonal [[elementary embedding]] $N \overset{\Delta}{\to} N^{\mathcal{U}}$ to any [[ultrapower]] $N^{\mathcal{U}}$ of $N$.

If $i \colon N \to M$ is an [[elementary embedding]], we say that $N$ is an ultraroot of $M$ if there is some [[ultrafilter]] $\mathcal{U}$ on some index [[set]] such that there is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
\left(N \overset{i}{\to} M\right) \simeq \left(N \overset{\Delta}{\to} N^{\mathcal{U}}\right)
$$
in the [[co-slice category]] under $N$. 

## Examples

* $N$ is an ultraroot of $N^{\mathcal{U}}$.

* Assuming the [[continuum hypothesis]], any [[countable set|countable]] model of a complete-[[first order theory]] will be an ultraroot of that theory's $\aleph_1$-saturated continuum-sized model.

* Similarly, taking a countably-indexed ultrapower of a slightly-expanded copy (like a nonstandard model generated by throwing in a single infinitesimal) of the reals still yields the [[hyperreal numbers]].

## Remarks
Closure under taking ultraroots, along with closure under ultraproducts and elementary embeddings, gives a criterion for detecting [[elementary class of structures|elementary classes]]. See also at _[[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]]_.
