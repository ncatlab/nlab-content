## Statement

For a [[planar graph]] $\Gamma$ the numbers of [[edges]], [[vertices]] and number of regions enclosed by edges ("faces") always satisfies the relation

$$
  1 = \vert Vertices(\Gamma)\vert - \vert Edges(\Gamma)\vert + 
   \vert Faces(\Gamma)\vert
  \,.
$$

By passing to the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[plane]], which is the [[2-sphere]], we may think of the planar graph as a [[polyhedron]] embedded in the 2-sphere. Under this identification the above is a special case of the general formula for [[Euler characteristic]] of [[CW-complexes]]. See at _[Euler characteristic -- Of topological spaces](Euler+characteristic#OfATopologicalSpace)_.

## Applications

### In perturbative quantum field theory

That the [[loop order]] of a (planar) [[Feynman diagram]] is its contribution in powers of [[Planck's constant]] to the [[scattering amplitude]] is a consequence of Euler's formula. See at _[loop order -- Relation to powers in Planck's constant](loop+order#RelationToPowersInPlancksConstant)_
