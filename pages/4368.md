## The idea ##

**Gabriel--Ulmer duality** says that there is a equivalence of 2-categories (or in other words, a [[biequivalence]]) 

$$ 
\begin{matrix}
Lex^{op} & \to &  LFP \\
  C      & \mapsto & Lex(C, Set) 
\end{matrix}
$$

where [[Lex]] is the 2-category of:

* small finitely complete categories, 

* finite limit preserving functors, and 

* natural transformations, 

and LFP is the 2-category of 

* locally finitely presentable
categories, 

* finitary right adjoint functors and 

* natural transformations.

The idea is that an object $C \in Lex$ can be thought of as an [[essentially algebraic theory]], which has a category of [[model|models]] $Lex(C,Set)$.  Gabriel--Ulmer duality says that this category of models is locally finitely presentable, and that we can recover the theory $C$ from its category of models.
