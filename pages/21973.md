## Idea

By a _vortex string_ one typically means a [[string]]-shaped [[soliton]] threading through a [[vortex]]-solution of in 4-dimensional [[gauge theory]]. 

The original example are the magnetic flux tubes through the [[Abrikosov vortices]] seen in [[type II superconductors]] at critical values of the [[electromagnetic field]]. The idea to think of these as [[string]]-like dynamical objects in themselves, much as in [[string theory]], is due to [Nielsen-Olesen 73](#NielsenOlesen73), hence one also speaks of _Nielsen-Oleson vortices_ or _Nielsen-Olesen strings_.

More generally, such string-shaped vortices are considered in [[Yang-Mills theories]] with [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[gauge group]] (see e.g. [Tong 09](#Tong09)).
