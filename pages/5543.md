## Idea

A _dense sub-site_ is a [[subcategory]] of a [[site]] such that the corresponding [[categories of sheaves]] are [[equivalent|equivalence of categories]].

## Definition

+-- {: .un_prop #InducedCoverage}
###### Definition

For $(C,J)$ a [[site]] with [[coverage]] $J$ and $D \to C$ any [[subcategory]], the **induced coverage** $J_D$ on $D$ has as [[covering]] [[sieve]]s the intersections of the covering sieves of $C$ with the morphisms in $D$.

+-- {: .un_prop #DenseSubSite}
###### Definition

Let $(C,J)$ be a [[site]] (possibly [[large site|large]]). A [[subcategory]] $D \to C$ (not necessarily full) is called a **[[dense sub-site]]** with the [induced coverage](#InducedCoverage) $J_D$ if

1. every object $U \in C$ has a [[covering]] $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $J$ with all $U_i$ in $D$;

1. for every morphism $f : U \to d$ in $C$ with $d \in D$ there is a [[covering]] family $\{f_i : U_i \to U\}$ such that the composites $f \circ f_i$ are in $D$.

###### Remark

If $D$ is a [[full subcategory]] then the second condition is automatic.

###### Theorem
**(comparison lemma)**

Let $(C,J)$ be a (possibly [[large site|large]]) [[site]] with $C$ a [[locally small category]] and let $f : D \to C$ be a [[small category|small]] [dense sub-site](#DenseSubSite). Then pair of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  (f^* \dashv f_*) 
    : 
  PSh(D)
    \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}  
   PSh(C)
$$

with $f^*$ given by precomposition with $f$ and $f_*$ given by right [[Kan extension]] induces an [[equivalence of categories]] between the categories of sheaves

$$
  (f_* \dashv f^*) : 
  Sh_{J_D}(D)
  \underoverset
    {\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\overset{f^*}
    {\leftarrow}}
    {\simeq}
  Sh_J{C}
  \,.
$$

###### Examples


* Let $X$ be a [[locale]] with [[frame]] $Op(X)$ regarded as a site with the canonical coverage ($\{U_i \to U\}$ covers if the [[join]] of the $U_i$ us $U$). Let $bOp(X)$ be a [[basis for the topology]] of $X$: a complete join-[[semilattice]] such that every object of $Op(X)$ is the [[join]] of objects of $bOp(X)$. Then $bOp(X)$ is a dense sub-site.

  * For $X$ a [[locally contractible space]], $Op(X)$ its [[category of open subsets]] and $cOp(X)$ the full subcategory of [[contractible]] open subsets, we have that $cOp(X)$ is a dense sub-site.

* For $C = TopManifold$  the category of all [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] [[topological manifold]]s equipped with the [[open cover]] coverage, the category [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$ is a dense sub-site: every paracompact [[topological manifold]] has a [[good open cover]] by [[open balls]] [[homeomorphic]] to a [[Cartesian space]].

  * Similarly for $C = $ [[Diff]] the category of [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] [[smooth manifold]]s equipped with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]], the full subcategory [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$ is a dense sub-site: every such smooth manifold has a _differentially_ [[good open cover]] (see there): a good cover by open balls each of which are [[diffeomorphic]] to a [[Cartesian space]].
