Moore-Seiberg data are structure constants for a [[modular tensor category]], seen as a [[Frobenius algebra]] in the 2-category of $Vect_k$-enriched abelian categories. More explicitely, Moore-Seiberg data for the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ are the collections of $k$-vector spaces
$$
\langle X_1,\dots,X_n\rangle=Hom_\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{1},X_1\otimes\cdots\otimes X_n),
$$
where $\mathbf{1}$ is the unit object of $\mathcal{C}$.
