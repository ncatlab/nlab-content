## Definition

A _topological ring_ is a [[ring]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Top]], a [[ring object]] in [[Top]]:

a [[topological space]] $R$ equipped with the structure of a [[ring]] on its underlying [[set]], such that addition and multiplication are [[continuous functions]]. Of course this makes $R$ a [[uniform space]]. 

A _topological field_ is a topological ring $K$ whose underlying ring is in fact a [[field]] and such that reciprocation $(-)^{-1}: K \setminus \{0\} \to K \setminus \{0\}$ is continuous. This latter condition is the same as demanding that the subspace topology on $K \setminus \{0\}$ induced by the embedding $K \setminus \{0\} \hookrightarrow K$ coincide with the subspace topology induced by the embedding $K \setminus \{0\} \to K \times K: x \mapsto (x, x^{-1})$. More at [[topological field]].

###### Remark 
In a topological ring, the closure of $\{0\}$ is an [[ideal]]. It follows that for a topological field $F$, either $0$ is a closed point (so that $F$ is $T_1$ and therefore [[Tychonoff space|completely regular Hausdorff]], by standard arguments in the theory of uniform spaces), or is a [[codiscrete space]].

A [[topological algebra]] over a topological ring $R$ is a topological ring $S$ together with a topological ring map $R \to S$ that makes $S$ an $R$-algebra at the underlying set level (a topological [[associative algebra]]). 


## Examples

* The [[real numbers]] form a topological field.

* Any [[pseudocompact ring]] such as the completed [[group ring]] of a [[profinite group]] is a topological ring.

*  For any prime $p$, the ring of [[p-adic integers]] is a topological ring.
  
* A [[Banach algebra]] is in particular a [[topological algebra]], hence a topological ring. Hence so is a [[C-star-algebra]].
