## Definition

A _topological ring_ is a [[ring]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Top]], a [[ring object]] in [[Top]]:

a [[topological space]] $R$ equipped with the structure of a [[ring]] on its underlying [[set]], such that addition and multiplication are [[continuous functions]].

Similarly a _topological field_ is a topological ring whose underlying ring is in fact a [[field]] and a [[topological algebra]] is a topological ring under a base topological ring (a topological [[associative algebra]]).

Shouldn't we demand that reciprocation be continuous in a topological field? Or does this somehow follow automatically? -Sridhar Ramesh

## Examples

* The [[real numbers]] form a topological field.

* Any [[pseudocompact ring]] such as the completed [[group ring]] of a [[profinite group]] is a topological ring.

*  For any prime $p$, the ring of [[p-adic integers]] is a topological ring.
  
* A [[Banach algebra]] is in particular a [[topological algebra]], hence a topological ring. Hence so is a [[C-star-algebra]].
