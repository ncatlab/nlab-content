## Definition

A _topological ring_ is a [[ring]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Top]], a [[ring object]] in [[Top]]:

a [[topological space]] $R$ equipped with the structure of a [[ring]] on its underlying [[set]], such that addition and multiplication are [[continuous functions]].

Similarly a _topological field_ is a topological ring whose underlying ring is in fact a [[field]].

## Examples

* The [[real numbers]] form a topological field.

* Any [[pseudocompact ring]] such as the completed [[group ring]] of a [[profinite group]] is a topological ring.

*  For any prime $p$, the ring of [[p-adic integer]]s is a topological ring.
