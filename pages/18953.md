## Idea

A [[Feynman diagram]] without external edges is called a _vacuum diagram_. 


For example the simplest vacuum diagram obtained from the [[electron-photon interaction]] in [[quantum electrodynamics]] is

In the computation of [[scattering amplitudes]] in a [[vacuum stability|stable vacuum]] the contribution of the vacuum diagrams to the [[Feynman perturbation series]] cancels out.

For details see at _[[S-matrix]]_ [this section](S-matrix#VacuumDiagrams)
