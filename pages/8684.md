A __filtered ring__ (resp. filtered algebra) is a [[filtered object]] in the category of rings (resp. algebras). 

One considers positive and negative filtrations, as well as $\mathbb{Z}$-filtrations. 

To-do list: complete filtrations, associated graded ring, symbol map, Poisson structure on the associated graded algebra if the latter is commutative.  

A major example is the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of any Lie algebra.

See also [[Lazard's criterion]] and [[microlocalization]].
