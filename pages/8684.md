## Definition

A __filtered ring__ (resp. filtered [[associative algebra|algebra]]) is a [[monoid object]] in the [[category]] of filtered abelian groups
(resp. [[filtered vector space]]s).

One considers positive and negative filtrations, as well as $\mathbb{Z}$-filtrations. 

To-do list: complete filtrations, associated graded ring, symbol map, Poisson structure on the associated graded algebra if the latter is commutative.  

## Examples

A major example is the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of any [[Lie algebra]].

## Related concepts
