## Definition

### In singular homology

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $A \hookrightarrow X$ a [[subspace]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain complex]] of [[singular homology]] on $X$ and $C_\bullet(A) \hookrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain map]] induced by the subspace inclusion.

###### Definition

The [[cokernel]] of this inclusion $C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A)$, hence the [[quotient]] by the [[image]] of the inclusion, is the **chain complex of $A$-relative chains**. Its [[chain homology]] is the **$A$-relative singular homology of $X$**

$$
  H_n(X | A)\coloneqq H_n(C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A))
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Relation to quotient topological spaces

+-- {: .num_prop #HomologyOfQuotientSpace}
###### Proposition

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is [[close subset|closed]] [[topological subspace]] such that $A$ has a [[neighbourhood]] which is a [[deformation retract]] in $X$, then the $A$-relative singular homology of $X$ coincides with the homology of the [[quotient space]] $X/A$: 

$$
  H_n(X/A)
  \simeq
  H_n(X| A)
 \,.
$$

### Long exact sequences

+-- {: .num_prop #RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence}
###### Proposition

Let $A \hookrightarrow X$. The corresponding 
relative homology sits in a [[long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  H_n(A)
  \to 
  H_n(X)
  \to 
  H_n(X|A)
  \to
  H_{n-1}(A)
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X)
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X|A)
  \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition and using the [[homology long exact sequence]] induced by the [[short exact sequence]] $0 \to A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} X \to coker(i) \to $ of chain complexes.

+-- {: .num_prop #RelativeTripleHomologyLongExactSequence}
###### Proposition

Let $B \hookrightarrow A \hookrightarrow X$ be a sequence of two inclusions. Then there is a [[long exact sequence]] of relative homology groups of the form

$$
  \cdots \to H_n(A |B) \to H_n(X | B) \to H_n(X |A ) \to H_{n-1}(A | B) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that we have a [[short exact sequence]] of chain complexes

$$
  0 \to A/B \to X/B \to X/A \to 0
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[homology long exact sequence]] is the long exact sequence in question.

###### Example

The singular homology of the $n$-[[sphere]] $S^{n} \simeq D^n / S^{n-1}$  equals the $S^{n-1}$-relative homology of the $n$-[[disk]].
