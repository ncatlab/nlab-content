# Reduced suspension

## Idea

If we take a [[pointed set|pointed space]] $(X,x_0)$, then its *reduced suspension* $\Sigma X$ is obtained by taking  the cylinder $I\times X$ and identifying the subspace $\{0,1\}\times X\cup I\times \{x_0\}$ to a point.  

(Think of crushing the two ends of the cylinder and the line through the base point to a point.) 

Compare the [[suspension]] $S X$, where there is no basepoint and only the ends of the cylinder are crushed.


## Definition

For a pointed space $(X,x_0)$,
$$\Sigma X = (I\times X)/\{0,1\}\times X\cup I\times \{x_0\}$$

This can also be thought of as forming $S^1\wedge X$, the  [[smash product]] of the [[circle]] (based at some point) with $X$: 

$$
  \Sigma X \simeq S^1 \wedge X
$$

## Properties

### Relation to suspension

For [[CW-complex]]es the reduced suspension is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary suspension: $\Sigma X \simeq S X$.

## Example

### Spheres

Up to [[homeomorphism]], the reduced suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere

$$
  \Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$
