# Reduced suspension

## Idea

For $(X,x_0) as $ [[pointed topological space]], then its *reduced suspension* $\Sigma X$ is obtained by taking  the cylinder $I\times X$ and identifying the subspace $\{0,1\}\times X\cup I\times \{x_0\}$ to a point.  

(Think of crushing the two ends of the cylinder and the line through the base point to a point.) 

Equivalently this is the [[smash product]] $S^1\wedge X$, of $X$ with the [[circle]] (based at some point) with $X$.

$$
  \Sigma X \simeq S^1 \wedge X
$$


This is in turn the result of taking the bare [[suspension]] $S X$ of $X$ and identifying $\{x_0\} \times I$ with a single point.



## Definition

For a pointed space $(X,x_0)$,
$$\Sigma X = (I\times X)/\{0,1\}\times X\cup I\times \{x_0\}$$


## Properties

### Relation to suspension

For [[CW-complex]]es the reduced suspension is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary suspension: $\Sigma X \simeq S X$.

## Example

### Spheres

Up to [[homeomorphism]], the reduced suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere

$$
  \Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$
