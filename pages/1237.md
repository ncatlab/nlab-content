# Reduced suspension

## Idea

For $(X,x) as $ [[pointed topological space]], then its *reduced suspension* $\Sigma X$ is equivalently 

* obtained from the standard [[cylinder]] $I\times X$ by identifying the subspace $(\{0,1\}\times X) \cup (I\times \{x\})$ to a point.  

  (Think of crushing the two ends of the cylinder and the line through the base point to a point.) 

* obtained from the bare [[suspension]] $S X$ of $X$ and identifying $\{x_0\} \times I$ with a single point.

* obtained from the [[reduced cylinder]] by collapsing the two ends, i.e. the [[cofiber]]

  $$
    \Sigma X \simeq cofib(X \vee X \to X \wedge (I_+))
  $$

* the [[mapping cone]] in [[pointed topological spaces]] formed with respect to the [[reduced cylinder]] $X \wedge (I_+)$ of the map $X \to \ast$;

* the [[smash product]] $S^1\wedge X$, of $X$ with the [[circle]] (based at some point) with $X$.

  $$
    \Sigma X \simeq S^1 \wedge X
    \,.
  $$


## Properties

### Relation to suspension

For [[CW-complex]]es the reduced suspension is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary suspension: $\Sigma X \simeq S X$.

### Cogroup structure

[[suspensions are H-cogroup objects]]

## Example

### Spheres

Up to [[homeomorphism]], the reduced suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere

$$
  \Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$
