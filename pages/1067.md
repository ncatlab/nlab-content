## Idea

### Basic

A _chain complex_ $V_\bullet$ is a sequence $\{V_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[abelian groups]] or [[modules]] (for instance [[vector spaces]]) or similar equipped with linear maps $\{d_n : V_{n+1} \to V_n\}$ such that $d^2 = 0$, i.e. the composite of two consecutive such maps is the [[zero morphism]] $d_n \circ d_{n+1} = 0$.

A basic example is the [[singular chain complex]] of a [[topological space]], or the [[de Rham complex]] of a [[smooth manifold]].

Chain complexes crucially come with their _[[chain homology]]_ [[groups]]. When regarding [[chain maps]] between them that induce [[isomorphisms]] on these groups ([[quasi-isomorphisms]]) as [[weak equivalences]], chain complexes form a useful presentation for aspects of [[stable homotopy theory]]. More on this aspect [below](#MeaningInHomotopyTheory).


### Meaning in homotopy theory
 {#MeaningInHomotopyTheory}

By the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] there is an equivalence between the category of *connective chain complexes of abelian groups* and the category of *abelian [[simplicial group|simplicial groups]]*. The functor

$$NCC:AB^\Delta^{op}\to Ch_\bullet^+(AB)$$

giving this equivalence is called [[Moore complex|normalized chain complex functor]] or [[Moore complex|Moore complex functor]].

In particular this reasoning shows that connective chain complexes of abelian groups are a model for abelian [[infinity-group|∞-groups]] (aka [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]] with abelian group structure).  This correspondence figures as part of the [[cosmic cube]]-classification scheme of [[n-category|n-categories]].


## Definition

### In components

A ($\mathbb{Z}$-graded) **chain complex** in a [[category]] $C$ with a notion of [[zero morphism]] (usually [[abelian category|abelian]]) is a sequence of [[object]]s $V_n$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, and [[morphism]]s $\partial_n:V_n \to V_{n-1}$ called [[differential|(co)differentials]] or _boundary maps_:

$$ 
\cdots \overset{\partial_3}{\to} V_2 \overset{\partial_2}{\to} V_1 \overset{\partial_1}{\to} V_0 \overset{\partial_0}{\to} V_{-1} \overset{\partial_{-1}}{\to} \cdots
$$

such that $\partial_n  \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$ (the [[zero morphism]]) for each $n$.  

(Note: the use of terminology 'differential' as against 'codifferential' depends largely on the traditions of the subject area in which the double complex is arising.)

More precisely, this is a _homologically graded_ chain complex, in which the differentials lower degree; if we rename $V_n$ to $V_{-n}$ so that the differentials raise degree, it becomes a _cohomologically graded_ chain complex or a **[[cochain complex]]**.  Common choices for $C$ include [[Ab]], [[Vect]], or $R Mod$, in which case we obtain the familiar definition of an (unbounded) chain complex of abelian groups, vector spaces, or modules.

Frequently one also considers $\mathbb{N}$-graded (or _nonnegatively graded_) chain complexes, which can be identified with $\mathbb{Z}$-graded ones for which $V_n=0$ when $n\lt 0$.  Similarly, an $\mathbb{N}$-graded _cochain_ complex is a cochain complex for which $V_n=0$ when $n\lt 0$, or equivalently a chain complex for which $V_n=0$ when $n\gt 0$.

### In terms of translations

Note that in particular, a chain complex is a [[graded object]] with extra structure.  This extra structure can be codified as a map of graded objects $\partial:V\to T V$, where $T$ is the 'shift' endofunctor of the category $Gr(V)$ of graded objects in $C$, such that $T(\partial) \circ \partial = 0$.  More generally, in any pre-additive category $G$ [[category with translation|with translation]] $T : G \to G$, we can define a **chain complex** to be a [[differential object]] $\partial_V : V \to T V$ such that $V \stackrel{\partial_V}{\to} T V \stackrel{T(\partial_V)}{\to} T T V$ is the [[zero morphism]].  When $G= Gr(C)$ this recovers the original definition.

## Examples

### Over a field

In $C =$ [[Vect]]$_k$ a chain complex is also called a [[differential graded vector space]], consistent with other terminology such as [[differential graded algebra]].  This is also a special case in other ways: every chain complex over a field is [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to its [[homology]] (the latter considered as a chain complex with zero differentials).  Nothing of the sort is true for chain complexes in more general categories.

### In chain complexes

A chain complex in a category of chain complexes is called a [[double complex]].


## Properties

### Model structure 

There is a [[model category]] structure on the category $Ch(A)$ of chain complexes in an [[abelian category]]. Its [[homotopy category]] is the [[derived category]] of $A$.
