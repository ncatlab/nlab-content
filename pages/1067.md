## Idea

A _chain complex_ is a [[complex]] in an [[additive category]] (often assumed to be an [[abelian category]]).

The archetypical example, from which the name derives, is the [[singular chain complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$.

Chain complexes are the basic objects of study in [[homological algebra]].

### Basic

A _chain complex_ $V_\bullet$ is a sequence $\{V_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[abelian groups]] or [[modules]] (for instance [[vector spaces]]) or similar equipped with linear maps $\{d_n : V_{n+1} \to V_n\}$ such that $d^2 = 0$, i.e. the composite of two consecutive such maps is the [[zero morphism]] $d_n \circ d_{n+1} = 0$.

A basic example is the [[singular chain complex]] of a [[topological space]], or the [[de Rham complex]] of a [[smooth manifold]].

Chain complexes crucially come with their _[[chain homology]]_ [[groups]]. When regarding [[chain maps]] between them that induce [[isomorphisms]] on these groups ([[quasi-isomorphisms]]) as [[weak equivalences]], chain complexes form a useful presentation for aspects of [[stable homotopy theory]]. More on this aspect [below](#MeaningInHomotopyTheory).


### Meaning in homotopy theory
 {#MeaningInHomotopyTheory}

By the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] there is an equivalence between the category of *connective chain complexes of abelian groups* and the category of *abelian [[simplicial group|simplicial groups]]*. The functor

$$NCC:AB^\Delta^{op}\to Ch_\bullet^+(AB)$$

giving this equivalence is called [[Moore complex|normalized chain complex functor]] or [[Moore complex|Moore complex functor]].

In particular this reasoning shows that connective chain complexes of abelian groups are a model for abelian [[infinity-group|∞-groups]] (aka [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]] with abelian group structure).  This correspondence figures as part of the [[cosmic cube]]-classification scheme of [[n-category|n-categories]].

###### Definition

A ($\mathbb{Z}$-graded) **chain complex** in $\mathcal{C}$ is 

* a collection of [[objects]] $\{C_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$, 

* and of [[morphisms]] $\partial_n : C_n \to C_{n-1}$

$$ 
  \cdots \overset{\partial_3}{\to} C_2 \overset{\partial_2}{\to} C_1 \overset{\partial_1}{\to} C_0 \overset{\partial_0}{\to} C_{-1} \overset{\partial_{-1}}{\to} \cdots
$$

such that 

$$
  \partial_n  \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0
$$ 

(the [[zero morphism]]) for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

A [[homomorphism]] of chain complexes is a [[chain map]] (see there). Chain complexes with chain maps between them form the [[category of chain complexes]] $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{C})$.

One uses the following  terminology for the components of a chain complex, all deriving from the example of a [[singular chain complex]]:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet$ a chain complex

* the morphisms $\partial_n$ are called the **[[differentials]]** or **[[boundary]] maps**;

* the [[element in an abelian category|elements]] of 
  are called the **$n$-[[chains]]**;

* the elements in the [[kernel]] 

  $$
    Z_n \coloneqq ker(\partial_{n-1})
  $$

  of $\partial_{n-1} : C_n \to C_{n-1}$ are called the **$n$-[[cycles]]**;

* the elements in the [[image]] 

  $$
    B_n \coloneqq im(\partial_n)
  $$

  of $\partial_{n} : C_{n+1} \to C_{n}$ are called the **$n$-[[boundaries]]**;

Notice that due to $\partial \partial = 0$ we have canonical inclusions

$$
  0 \hookrightarrow B_n \hookrightarrow Z_n \hookrightarrow C_n
  \,.
$$

* the [[cokernel]] 

  $$
    H_n \coloneqq Z_n/B_n
  $$

  is called the degree-$n$ **[[chain homology]]** of $C_\bullet$.

$$
  0 \to B_n \to Z_n \to H_n \to 0
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **[[cochain complex]]** in $\mathcal{C}$ is a chain complex in the [[opposite category]] $\mathcal{C}^{op}$. Hence a tower of morphisms as above, but with each [[differential]] $d_n : V^n \to V^{n+1}$ increasing the degree.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

One also says **homologically graded** complex, for the case that the differentials lower degree, and _cohomologically graded_ complex for the case where they raise degree.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Frequently one also considers $\mathbb{N}$-graded (or _nonnegatively graded_) chain complexes (for instance in the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]), which can be identified with $\mathbb{Z}$-graded ones for which $V_n=0$ when $n\lt 0$.  Similarly, an $\mathbb{N}$-graded _cochain_ complex is a cochain complex for which $V_n=0$ when $n\lt 0$, or equivalently a chain complex for which $V_n=0$ when $n\gt 0$.

### In terms of translations

Note that in particular, a chain complex is a [[graded object]] with extra structure.  This extra structure can be codified as a map of graded objects $\partial:V\to T V$, where $T$ is the 'shift' endofunctor of the category $Gr(V)$ of graded objects in $C$, such that $T(\partial) \circ \partial = 0$.  More generally, in any pre-additive category $G$ [[category with translation|with translation]] $T : G \to G$, we can define a **chain complex** to be a [[differential object]] $\partial_V : V \to T V$ such that $V \stackrel{\partial_V}{\to} T V \stackrel{T(\partial_V)}{\to} T T V$ is the [[zero morphism]].  When $G= Gr(C)$ this recovers the original definition.

## Examples

Common choices for the ambient [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{C}$ include [[Ab]], $k$[[Vect]] (for $k$ a [[field]]) and generally $R$[[Mod]] (for $R$ a [[ring]]), in which case we obtain the familiar definition of an (unbounded) chain complex of [[abelian groups]], [[vector spaces]] and, generally, of  [[modules]].


### In $k$-vector spaces

In $C =$ [[Vect]]$_k$ a chain complex is also called a [[differential graded vector space]], consistent with other terminology such as [[differential graded algebra]] over $k$.  This is also a special case in other ways: every chain complex over a field is [[formal dg-algebra|formal]]: [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to its [[homology]] (the latter considered as a chain complex with zero differentials).  Nothing of the sort is true for chain complexes in more general categories.

### In chain complexes

A chain complex in a category of chain complexes is a [[double complex]].

### Singular and cellular chain complex

For $X$ a [[topological space]], there is its [[singular simplicial complex]].

More generally, for $S$ a [[simplicial set]], there is the chain complex
$S \cdot R$ of $R$ [[chains on a simplicial set]].

### Of a simplicial abelian group

For $A_\bullet$ a [[simplicial abelian group]], there is a chain complex $C_\bullet(A)$, the [[alternating face map complex]], and a chain complex $N_\bullet(A)$, the [[normalized chain complex]] of $A$.

The [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] says that this construction establishes an [[equivalence of categories]] between non-negatively-graded chain complexes and [[simplicial abelian groups]].

## Properties

### Model structure 

There is a [[model category]] structure on the category $Ch(A)$ of chain complexes in an [[abelian category]]. Its [[homotopy category]] is the [[derived category]] of $A$.

See [[model structure on chain complexes]].
