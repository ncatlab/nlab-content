## Idea

From [Maldacena-Stanford 16](#MaldacenaStanford16):

> Studies of [[AdS-CFT|holography]] have been hampered by the lack of a simple solvable model that can capture features of [[Einstein gravity]].  The simplest model, which is a single matrix quantum mechanics, does not appear to lead to black holes. $\mathcal{N} = 4$ [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory|super Yang Mills]] at strong â€™t Hooft coupling certainly leads to [[black holes]], and exact results are known at large $N$ for many anomalous dimensions and some [[vacuum amplitude|vacuum]] [[correlation functions]], but at finite temperature the theory is difficult to study.

> A system that reproduces some of the dynamics of black holes should be [[interacting quantum field theory|interacting]], but we might hope for a model with interactions that are simple enough that it is still reasonable solvable.

> Kitaev has proposed to study a quantum mechanical model of $N$ Majorana fermions interacting  with  random  interactions ([Kitaev 15](#Kitaev15)).   It is a simple variant of a model introduced by  Sachdev and Ye ([Sachdev-Ye 93](#SachdevYe93)), which was first  discussed in relation to [[AdS-CFT|holography]] in ([Sachdev 10](#Sachdev10)).

From [Maldacena 18](#Maldacena18):

> The SYK model gives us a glimpse into the interior of an [[extremal black hole]]... That's the feature of SYK that I find most interesting... It is a feature this model has, that I think no other model has
