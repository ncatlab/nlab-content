## Idea ##

The _double nerve_ of a [[2-category]] $C$ is a [[bisimplicial set]] obtained by regarding $C$ as a [[Cat]]-[[enriched category]] or a [[Cat]]-[[internal category]] and then applying the ordinary [[nerve]] operation to each [[hom-object]] [[category]] to obtain first a [[simplicially enriched category]] and then to apply the obvious nerve operation again to obtain a [[bisimplicial set]].
