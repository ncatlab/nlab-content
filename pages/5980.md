The notion of a _term_ is an ingredient in [[type theory]] and thus also in [[logic]].

## Definition

In the [[internal language]] of any [[category]] $C$, a [[morphism]]

$$
  f : B \to A
$$

is a _term_ $f(x)$ of _[[type]]_ $A$ where $x$ is a _free [[variable]]_ of _[[type]]_ $B$, which in [[type theory|type-theoretic]] symbols is given by

$$ 
  x\colon B \vdash f(x)\colon A
  \,.
$$
