## Idea
 {#Idea}

A [[topological space]] (or more generally [[convergence space]]) is _compact_ if everything converges as much as possible. It is a kind of ultimate topological expression of the general idea of a space being "closed and bounded": every [[net]] must accumulate somewhere in the space; by boundedness it cannot escape, and by closure the point is in the space. There is also a notion of compactness for [[locales]].

It is also common to work with compact subsets of a topological space.  These are those subsets which are compact spaces with the inherited topology.

## Definitions 

There are many ways to say that a space $X$ is compact. The first is perhaps the most common: 
+-- {: .num_defn #hb}
###### Definition
For every collection of open sets whose [[union]] is $X$ (which _[[covers]]_ $X$), there is a (Kuratowski)-[[finite set|finite]] subcollection which also covers $X$.
=--
If [[excluded middle]] is assumed, this is easily equivalent to: 
+-- {: .num_defn #fip}
###### Definition
For any collection of closed sets of $X$ whose [[intersection]] is [[empty set|empty]], some finite subcollection also has empty intersection.
=--

If the [[ultrafilter theorem]] (a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]) is assumed, compactness can be characterized in terms of [[ultrafilter]] (or ultranet) convergence: 
+-- {: .num_defn #ultrafilter}
###### Definition
Every ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ (or ultranet $\nu$) on $X$ converges to some point $x \in X$, meaning that $\mathcal{U}$ contains the filter of [[neighborhoods]] of $x$ (or that $\nu$ is eventually in any neighbourhood of $x$).
=--
In any case, compactness can be characterized in terms of [[filter]] (or [[net]]) convergence:
+-- {: .num_defn #refinement}
###### Definition
Every proper filter (or net) on $X$ has a convergent proper [[refinement]] (or subnet).
=--

This is equivalent to the characterization given in the [Idea-section](#Idea) above:
 
+-- {: .num_defn #clustering}
###### Definition
Every proper filter $\mathcal{U}$ (or net $\nu$) on $X$ has a cluster point $x$, meaning that every element of $\mathcal{U}$ meets (has [[inhabited set|inhabited]] intersection with) every neighbourhood of $x$ (or $\nu$ is frequently in every neighbourhood of $x$).
=--
While the usual definitions (\ref{hb}&\ref{fip}) are for [[topological spaces]], the convergence definitions (\ref{ultrafilter}--\ref{clustering}) make sense in any [[convergence space]].

The definition (\ref{hb}) also works for [[locales]], since it refers only to the [[frame]] of open sets.  An equivalent way to phrase it is
+-- {: .num_defn #directed}
###### Definition
Given any [[direction|directed]] collection of opens whose union is $X$, $X$ belongs to the collection.
=--
As the union is the [[coproduct]] in the [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$, we can also say
+-- {: .num_defn #object}
###### Definition
The ambient space $X$ is a [[compact object]] in $Op(X)$.
=--

Compactness is equivalent to the condition of being "stably closed" (and it is this condition which suggests the correct notion of [[proper map]] in [[algebraic geometry]] and elsewhere):
+-- {: .num_defn #projection}
###### Definition
For any space $Y$, the projection map $X \times Y \to Y$ is [[closed map|closed]].
=--

Contrary to possible appearance, the equivalence of this with definition \ref{hb} does not require the axiom of choice; see [this MO question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/42186/does-compact-iff-projections-are-closed-require-some-form-of-choice/42196) and answers, as well as [this page](/toddtrimble/published/Characterizations+of+compactness). See also the page [[compactness and stable closure]] (under construction). 

Closely related to the previous definition, a [[logic]]al characterisation of compactness is used in [[Abstract Stone Duality]]:
+-- {: .num_defn #quantification}
###### Definition
For any space $Y$ and any open subset $U$ of $X \times Y$, the subset
$$ \forall_X U = \{ b : Y \;|\; \forall\; a: X,\; (a, b) \in U \} $$
is open in $Y$.
=--
To remove it from dependence on points, we can also write the definition like this:
+-- {: .num_defn #pointless}
###### Definition
Given any space $Y$ and any open $U$ in $X \times Y$, there exists an open $\forall_X U$ in $Y$ that satisfies the [[universal property]] of universal [[quantification]]:
$$ V \subseteq \forall_X U \;\Leftrightarrow\; X \times V \subseteq U $$
for every open $V$ in $Y$.
=--
A [[de Morgan duality|dual]] condition is satisfied by an [[overt space]].


### Differing terminology

Some authors use "compact" to mean "compact [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]]" (a much [[nice topological space|nicer sort of space]], and forming a much [[nice category of spaces|nicer category of spaces]]), and use the word "[[quasicompact]]" to refer to just "compact" as we are using it here. This custom seems to be prevalent among [[algebraic geometry|algebraic geometers]], for example, and particularly so within Francophone schools.

> But it is far from clear to me ([[Todd Trimble]]) that "quasicompact" is very well-established outside such circles (despite some arguments in favor of it), and using simply "compact" for the nicer concept therefore carries some risk of creating misunderstanding among mathematicians at large. My own habit at any rate is to say "compact Hausdorff" for the nicer concept, and I will continue using this on the $n$Lab until consensus is reached (if that happens).

Another term in usage is 'compactum' to mean a [[compact Hausdorff space]] (even when 'compact' is not used to imply Hausdorffness).


## Properties

* Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the category of compact spaces admits all small [[limits]]. In any case, the category of compact locales admits all small limits. See also [[Tychonoff theorem]].

* The direct [[image]] of a compact subspace under a [[continuous map]] is compact. A topological space becomes a [[bornological set]] by taking the bounded sets to be subsets with compact closure, and under this bornology, every continuous function is a bounded map.  

* A compact [[Hausdorff space]] must be [[normal space|normal]].  That is, the [[separation axioms]] $T_2$ through $T_4$ (when interpreted as an increasing sequence) are equivalent in the presence of compactness.

* The [[Heine-Borel theorem]] asserts that a subspace $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of a [[Cartesian space]] is compact precisely if it is [[closed subset|closed]] and [[bounded subset|bounded]].

* In constructive mathematics, a [[discrete object|discrete space]] is compact iff its underlying set is [[finite set|Kuratowski-finite]].

One often wishes to study [[compact Hausdorff spaces]].  For locales, one usually speaks of compact [[regular space|regular]] locales; these are equivalent (since every locale is $T_0$ and hence $T_3$ if regular, while every Hausdorff space is $T_3$ if compact) since regularity is easier to formulate and handle than Hausdorffness in locale theory.
