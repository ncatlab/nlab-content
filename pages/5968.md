## In terms of the variational bicomplex

Here we formulate Noether's theorem for [[local action functional]] in terms of the [[variational bicomplex]] and the [[covariant phase space]].

### The context

Let $X$ be a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $n$, $E \to X$ a [[bundle]], $j_\infty E \to X$ its [[jet bundle]] and 

$$
  \Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}(j_\infty E), (D = \delta + d)
$$ 

the corresponding [[variational bicomplex]] with $\delta$ being the vertical and $d$ the horizontal [[differential]].


+-- {: .num_prop #VariationOfTheLagrangian}
###### Proposition

For $L \in \Omega^{n,0}(j_\infty E)$ a [[Lagrangian]] we have that 

$$
  \delta L = E(L) + d \Theta
$$

for $E$ the [[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange operator]].

=--

The [[covariant phase space]] of the Lagrangian is the locus

$$ 
  \{\phi \in \Gamma(E) | E(L)(j_\infty \phi) = 0\}  
$$

that solves the [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]].

For $\Sigma \subset X$ any $(n-1)$-dimensional [[submanifold]], 

$$
  \delta \theta := \delta \int_\Sigma \Theta
$$

is the [[presymplectic structure]] on [[covariant phase space]].

###### Definition

A **[[symmetry]]** of $L$ is a [[vertical vector field]] $v$ such that 

$$
  v(L) = d \sigma_v
$$

for some

$$
  \sigma_v \in \Omega^{n-1,0}(j_\infty E)
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

By [[Cartan's magic formula]] this is equivalent to 

$$
  \iota_{v} \delta L = d \sigma_v
  \,.

###### Definition

A **[[conserved current]]** is an element

$$
  j \in \Omega^{n-1, 0}(j_\infty E)
$$

which is horizontally closed on [[covariant phase space]]

$$
  d j|_{E(L) = 0} = 0
  \,.

###### Theorem

If $v \in T_v(j_\infty E)$ is a [[symmetry]], def. \ref{Symmetry}, then 

$$
  j_v := \sigma_v - \iota_v \theta
$$

is a [[conserved current]], def. \ref{ConservedCurrent}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{VariationOfTheLagrangian} and def. \ref{Symmetry} we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d (\sigma_v - \iota_v \theta)
    & =
    \iota_v \delta L + \iota_v d \theta
    \\
    & = \iota_v E(L)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

## In terms of moment maps -- Hamiltonian Noether theorem
 {#HamiltonianNoetherTheorem}

In [[symplectic geometry]] the analog of Noether's theorem is the statement that the [[moment map]] of a [[Hamiltonian action]] is conserved. 

Souriau called this _the symplectic Noether theorem_, sometimes it is called the _Hamiltonian Noether theorem_.

Let $(X,\omega)$ be a [[symplectic manifold]] and let $\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{Poisson}(X,\omega)$ be a [[Hamiltonian action]] with [[Hamiltonian]] $H \in C^\infty(X)$, thought of as the time evolution of a [[physical system]] with [[phase space]] $(X,\omega)$.

Then let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] with [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $\mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{Poisson}(X,\omega)$ be a [[Hamiltonian action]] with [[Hamiltonian]]/[[moment map]] 
$\Phi \in C^\infty(X,\mathfrak{g}^\ast)$. We say this preserves the (time evolution-)Hamiltonian $H$ if for all $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ the [[Poisson bracket]] between the two vanishes, 

$$
  \delta_\xi H \coloneqq  \{\Phi(\xi), H\} = 0
  \,.
$$

In this situation now the statement of Noether's theorem is that the generators $\Phi(\xi)$ of the symmetry are preserved by the time evolution 

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \Phi^\xi = 0
  \,.
$$

In this symplectic formulation this is immediate, because

$$
  \frac{d}{d t}\Phi^\xi = \{H,\Phi^\xi\} = - \{\Phi^\xi, H\} = 0
  \,,
$$

by the above assumtion that $H$ is preserved. Hence the "Hamiltonian Noether theorem" is all captured already by the very notion of [[Hamiltonian action]] and the  statement that the [[Poisson bracket]] is skew-symmetric (is a [[Lie algebra]] bracket).

Specifically, if one has a global [[polarization]] of $(X,\omega)$ with [[canonical coordinates]] $\{q^i\}$ and [[canonical momenta]] $\{p_i\}$ and if the symmetry action is on the canonical coordinates (on configuration space), then for $v_\xi$ the [[vector field]] corresponding to the generator $\xi$ the moment map is 

$$
  \Phi^\xi = p_i (v_\xi)^i
  \,.
$$

On the right this is the term in the form in which the conserved quantity obtained from the Nother theorem is traditionally written
(using that given a [[Lagrangian]] $L$ we have $p_i = \frac{\delta L}{\delta (\dot q^i)}$).
