## The context

Let $X$ be a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] $n$, $E \to X$ a [[bundle]], $j_\infty E \to X$ its [[jet bundle]] and 

$$
  \Omega^{\bullet,\bullet}(j_\infty E), (D = \delta + d)
$$ 

the corresponding [[variational bicomplex]] with $\delta$ being the vertical and $d$ the horizontal [[differential]].


+-- {: .num_prop #VariationOfTheLagrangian}
###### Proposition

For $L \in \Omega^{n,0}(j_\infty E)$ a [[Lagrangian]] we have that 

$$
  \delta L = E(L) + d \Theta
$$

for $E$ the [[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange operator]].

=--

The [[covariant phase space]] of the Lagrangian is the locus

$$ 
  \{\phi \in \Gamma(E) | E(L)(j_\infty \phi) = 0\}  
  \,.
$$

For $\Sigma \subset X$ any $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifold, 

$$
  \delta \theta := \delta \int_\Sigma \Theta
$$

is the [[presymplectic structure]] on covariant phase space

###### Definition

A **[[symmetry]]** of $L$ is a vertical [[vector field]] $v$ such that 

$$
  v(L) = d \sigma_v
$$

for some

$$
  \sigma_v \in \Omega^{n-1,0}(j_\infty E)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By [[Cartan's magic formula]] this is equivalent to 

$$
  \iota_{v} \delta L = d \sigma_v
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A **[[conserved current]]** is an element

$$
  j \in \Omega^{n-1, 0}(j_\infty E)
$$

which is horizontally closed on [[covariant phase space]]

$$
  d j|_{E(L) = 0} = 0
  \,.
$$

## Statement

With the above notions and notation, **Noether's theorem** states:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $v \in T_v(j_\infty E)$ is a symmetry, then 

$$
  j_v := \sigma_v - \iota_v \theta
$$

is a [[conserved current]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{VariationOfTheLagrangian} and def. \ref{Symmetry} we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d (\sigma_v - \iota_v \theta)
    & =
    \iota_v \delta L + \iota_v d \theta
    \\
    & = \iota_v E(L)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$
