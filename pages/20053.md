## Idea

A **$\tau$-additive measure** (alias τ-regular, τ-smooth) is a [[measure]] on a [[topological space]] which interacts well with the topology. In particular, it has a well-defined and well-behaved [[support]].

$\tau$-additive measures can be thought of as a point of contact between [[measure theory]], and the theory of [[valuation (measure theory)|valuations]]. More on this in [[correspondence between measure and valuation theory]].

## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. A positive [[Borel subset|Borel measure]] $\mu$ on $X$ is called **$\tau$-additive**, or **$\tau$-smooth**, or **$\tau$-regular**, if for every directed [[net]] $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ of [[open subsets]] of $X$,
$$
  \mu \big( \sup_{\lambda} U_\lambda \big) 
  = 
  \sup_\lambda \mu(U_\lambda) .
$$

This property can be considered an instance of [[Scott topology|Scott continuity]], and is equivalent to continuity of the [[valuation (measure theory)|valuation]] defined by $\mu$ on the open sets.
