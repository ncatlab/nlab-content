## Idea

A _string_ is a [[brane]] of dimension one higher than an ordinary [[particle]]:

where a 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[sigma-model]] may be thought of a describing the dynamics of [[particle]]s propagating of a [[target space]] $X$, a 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] is said to described the dynamics of a string on some target space.

Much of traditional [[quantum field theory]] on $X$ may be understood in terms of [[second quantization]] of 1-dimensional [[sigma-models]] with [[target space]] $X$. What is called _[[string theory]]_ is the corresponding study of what happens to this situation as the 1-dimensional $\sigma$-model is replaced by a 2-dimensional one.

There is 

* the [[bosonic string]] of [[bosonic string theory]]

* the [[superstring]] of [[superstring theory]]

(also called the _[[F1-brane]]_)

* there is also the [[D1-brane]].
