## Idea 

An ordinary "[[line]]" $\mathbb{R}$ is sometimes thought of as the result of gluing a countable number of copies of a half-open interval $[0, 1)$ end-to-end in both directions. A _long line_ is similarly obtained by gluing an uncountable number of copies of $[0, 1)$ end-to-end in both directions, and is demonstrably "longer" than an ordinary line on account of a number of peculiar properties. 

The long line is a source of many counterexamples in topology. 

## Definition  

+-- {: .num_defn} 
Let $\omega_1$ be the first uncountable ordinal, and consider $[0, 1)$ as an [[total order|ordered set]]. A **long ray** is the ordered set $\omega_1 \times [0, 1)$ taken in the [[lexicographic order]]; as a [[topological space|space]], it is given the order topology. The **long line** is the space obtained by gluing two long rays together at their initial points.

The long line is a line in the sense of being a $1$-dimensional [[manifold]] (without boundary) that is not closed (so not a [[circle]]).  However, it is not [[paracompact space|paracompact]], so it is not [[homeomorphic]] to the [[real line]] (even though it is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]).



## Properties 

Let $L$ denote the long line, and $R$ the long ray. 

1. Every continuous function $f \colon L \to \mathbb{R}$ is eventually constant, i.e., there exists $x \in L$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(y) = c$ whenever $y \geq x$ (and similarly $f$ is constant for all sufficiently small $x$). 

1. $L$ is a [[separation axioms|normal]] ($T_4$) space, but the product $L \times L$ is not normal. (See for example [Munkres](#Munk).) 

1. Every continuous map $L \to L$ has a fixed point. 

1. $R$ is [[sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]] but not [[compact space|compact]]. 

1. The long line is not contractible. Proof sketch: Suppose $H \colon I \times L \to L$ is a homotopy such that $H(0, -)$ is constant and $H(1, -)$ is the identity. For each $t \in [0, 1]$ the image $\im H(t, -)$ is an interval (either bounded or unbounded), since $L$ is [[connected space|connected]]. One may show the set 
$$\{t \in I: \im H(t, -) \text{is bounded}\}$$ 
is both closed and open. It also contains $0$, hence is all of $I$. But it can't contain $t = 1$, contradiction.
