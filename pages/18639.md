## Definition

For [[categories]] $C,D$, let $C \Rightarrow D$ be the category whose objects are functors from $C$ to $D$ and whose morphisms are [[unnatural transformations]].  This makes $Cat$ into a [[closed category]].  We can then define a [[tensor product]] by a [[universal property]] and make $Cat$ into a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(Cat,\Box)$; this tensor product $\Box$ is called the **funny tensor product**.

The funny tensor product can also be generalized to [[higher categories]].
