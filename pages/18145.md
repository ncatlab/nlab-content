## Definition

Given a [[set]] $X_i$, $i \in I$ of [[topological space]], then their _disjoint union space_ $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i$ is the topological space whose underlying set is the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying sets of the $X_i$, and whose [[open subsets]] are precisely the disjoint unions of the open subsets of the $X_i$.

More abstractly, this is the [[coproduct]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of topological spaces.
