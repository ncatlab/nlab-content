A **fork** is a diagram of the form

$$
A\underset{\quad e \quad}{\to}B\underoverset{\quad g \quad}{f}{\rightrightarrows}C
$$

such that $f e=g e$. An example of a special type of a fork is an [[equalizer]]. 

A dual notion is also called a fork, 
but some people distinguish forks and coforks.
