#Idea#

A _combinatorial spectrum_ is to a [[spectrum]] of [[topological space]]s as a [[simplicial set]] is to a [[topological space]]: it is a graded set that behaves like a set of simplices constituting a space, where the special property is that the simplices are not just in non-negative degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$ but in all integral degrees $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

#Definition#

A **combinatorial spectrum** is 

* a sequence $E = \{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of [[pointed set]]s 

* equipped for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with

  * morphisms of [[pointed set]]s $d_i : E_n \to E_{n-1}$ called **face maps**;

  * morphisms of [[pointed set]]s $s_i : E_n \to E_{n+1}$ called **degeneracy maps**

* such that

  * the usual [[simplicial set|simplicial identities]] are satisfied;

  * each simplex has only finitely many faces different from the point of $E_{n-1}$: i.e. for every $x \in E_n$ there are only finitely many $i \in \mathbb{N}$ for which $d_i(x)$ is not the point.

#Examples#

The standard [[simplicial set]]s corresponding to the standard [[simplex|simplices]] have their analogs for simplicial spectra. . The difference is that regarded as a spectrum the $k$-simplex may sit in any degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$, not necessarily in degree $k$.

**The $(k+1)$-simplex in degree $n$.** For each integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a spectrum 

$$
  \Delta^{k}[n-k]
$$ 

which is _generated_ from a single element $x \in E_n$ subject to the relation that $d_i x = *$ for $i \gt k$.  So this is something with $(k+1)$-faces, hence looking like a $k$-[[simplex]], but sitting in degree $n$. 

The sub-spectrum

$$
  \partial (\Delta^{k}[n-k])
$$ 

of $\Delta^{k}[n-k]$ generated by the faces $d_i x$. This is the **boundary** of the $k$-simplex in degree $n$.

The spectrum

$$
  S^n
$$

generated by a single simplex $x \in E_n$ subject to the relation $d_i x = 0$ for all $i$. This is the **$n$-sphere** as a spectrum.


The sub-spectrum $\Lambda^{k}_j[n-k]$ for $0 \leq j \leq k$ is the sub-spectrum of $\Delta^{k}[n-k]$ generated from all the faces $d_i x$ except $d_j x$. This is the  $j$th **horn** of the $k$-simplex in degree $n$. Compare with the [[horn]] of a [[simplex]].

As for [[simplex|simplices]], there are canonical [[horn]] inclusion morphisms of combinatorial spectra

$$
  \Lambda^k_j[n-k] \hookrightarrow \Delta^k[n-k]
  \,.
$$

A condition entirely analogous to the [[Kan fibration]] condition on [[Kan complex|Kan simplicial sets]] leads to the notion of **Kan combinatorial spectrum**.

#Discussion#

A previous version of this entry triggered the following discussion:

+--{: .query}
[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Are you sure about that last condition?  I remember a condition more like "for each $x\in E_n$ there is some finite $m \lt n$ such that all faces of $x$ in $E_m$ are the basepoint.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: on the bottom of page 437 in the reference by Brown it says: "each simplex of $E$ has only finitely many faces different from $*$".

I see that my original phrasing reflected this only very imprecisely. I have tried to improve that now. But it also seems that this condition $m \lt n$ which you mention is not implied by Brown(?) In particular, it seems this condition does not harmoize with the fact that $n$ may be negative.

But this looks like the condition which does appear in the definition of the $n$-simplex spectra (next page of Brown). I have added that in the list of examples now.

Another question: what's the established term for these things here? I made up both "combinatorial spectrum" and "simplicial spectrum" after reading Brown's article, which just calls this "spectrum" without qualification. I am tending to think that "simplicial spectrum" would be a good term.

Related to that: what's a more recent good reference on these combinatorial version of spectra?

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I was remembering a condition like that from Kan's original article "Semisimplicial spectra," which I unfortunately don't have access to a copy of right now.  I think the idea is that a spectrum of this sort is built out of a naive prespectrum of simplicial sets (that is, a sequence of based simplicial sets $X_n$ with maps $\Sigma X_n \to X_{n+1}$) by making the $k$-simplices of $X_n$ into $(k-n)$-simplices in the spectrum.  I thought the condition on $m\lt n$ is sort of saying that each simplex comes from $X_n$ for some $n\lt \infty$.  But possibly my memory is just wrong.

Since Kan's original term was "semisimplicial spectrum" back when "semisimplicial set" meant what we now call a "simplicial set," it's hard to argue with "simplicial spectrum."  As far as I know, however, no algebraic topologist has really thought seriously about these things for quite some time, probably due largely to the appearance of symmetric monoidal categories of spectra (EKMM $S$-modules, orthogonal spectra, symmetric spectra, etc.) of which there is no known analogue for this sort of spectra.  It's kind of a shame, I think, since these spectra give a really good intuition of "an object with $k$-cells for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}$."  I spent a little while once trying to come up with a version of these that would have a symmetric monoidal smash product, maybe starting with simplicial symmetric spectra instead of naive prespectra, but I failed.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: thanks, very useful. That's a piece of information that I was looking for. 

Yes, this combinatorial spectrum is nicely suggestive of a $\mathbb{Z}$-category. It seems surprising that there shouldn't be a symmetric monoidal product on that. What goes wrong?

Concerning terminology: now that I thought about it I feel that "simplicial spectrum" may tend to be misleading, as it collides with the use of "simplicial xyz" as a simplicial object internal to the category of $xyz$s. Surely some people out there will already be looking at functors $\Delta^{op} \to Spectra$ and call them "simplicial spectra" (?)
