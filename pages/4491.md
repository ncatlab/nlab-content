Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[scheme]]s. Let $\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal map. We say that $f$ is separated if $\Delta(X)$ is a closed subspace of $X \times_Y X$.

We say that scheme $X$ is separated if the canonical map $X \to \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ is separated.

Separated schemes are analogous to Hausdorff topological spaces.

There is a valuative criterion of separatedness. See Hartshorne or EGA for more details.
