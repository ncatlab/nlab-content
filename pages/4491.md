Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[scheme]]s. Let $\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal map. We say that $f$ is __separated__ if $\Delta(X)$ is a [[closed subspace]] of $X \times_Y X$.

We say that scheme $X$ is __separated__ if the canonical map $X \to \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ is separated.

Separated schemes are analogous to [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff topological spaces]] (which are also sometimes called 'separated').  The characterization in terms of the diagonal map is precisely the same as that used for Hausdorff [[locales]].

There is a [[valuative criterion of separatedness]]. See Hartshorne or [[EGA II]] for more details.
