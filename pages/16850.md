A (proper) **vertex coloring** of a [[graph]] is a labelling of its vertices with the property that no two vertices sharing an edge have the same label, while an **$n$-coloring** is a vertex coloring using at most $n$ distinct labels. The **chromatic number** $\chi(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the least $n$ such that $G$ has an $n$-coloring.

Vertex coloring may also be expressed in terms of graph homomorphisms: a $n$-coloring of $G$ is the same thing as a graph homomorphism $G \to K_n$ into the complete graph on $n$ vertices.
This formulation makes clear the duality between colorings and _cliques_: an $n$-[[clique]] in $G$ is the same thing as a homomorphism $K_n \to G$.
