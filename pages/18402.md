## Idea

The _Reeb sphere theorem_ in [[differential topology]] says that: 

If a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[differentiable manifold]] $X$ admits a [[differentiable function]] $X \to \mathbb{R}$ with exactly two [[critical points]] which are non-degenerate, then $X$ is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]] (with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]).

In fact this holds true even if the two critical points happen to be degenerate ([Milnor 64, theorem 1' on p. 166](#Milnor64))

## Proof

Let $x_1, x_2 \in X$ denote the two [[critical points]]. Let $\mathbb{R}^n \simeq U_{x_1} \subset X$ be a Euclidean neighbourhood of $x_1$ not containing $x_2$. Write $\nabla f \in \Gamma(T X)$ for the [[gradient]] [[vector field]] of $f$. By assumption, for every [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspace]] $C \subset X \setminus \{x_2\}$ there exists a [[flow of a vector field|flow]] along $\nabla f$ which extends $U_x$ to a possibly larger Euclidean neighbourhood that contains $C$ (say this in more detail). By the [[Brown-Stallings lemma]] this implies a [[homeomorphism]] $X \setminus \{x_2\} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$. It follows that $X$ is the [[one-point compactification]] of $X \setminus \{x_2\} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$, which is the [[n-sphere]] (by [this example](one-point+compactification#nSphereIsOnePointCompactificationOfRn)).

## Applications

Notice that the Reeb sphere theorem does _not_ speak of [[diffeomorphism]] to an [[n-sphere]], just about [[homeomorphism]]. Indeed, the theorem may be used as an ingredient in the construction of [[exotic smooth structures]] on some $n$-spheres.
