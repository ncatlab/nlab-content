## Idea

A _logical relation_ between [[sets]]/[[types]] equipped with extra (algebraic) [[structure]] is a [[relation]] that preserves this structure in the appropropriate way. Hence logical relations are to [[relations]] as [[homomorphisms]] between (algebraic) structure are to [[functions]] of the underlying sets/types. See for instance ([Hermida 13, section 2](#Hermida13)) for a quick survey.

Formal reasoning is critical for building truly secure and reliable software, and one of the key techniques for establishing properties of software systems is that of logical relations ([Reynolds 83](#Reynolds83)). Logical relations can be used to prove i) properties of [[programs]], e.g., that they perform no illegal operations, satisfy certain security criteria, or are observationally equivalent to their compiled forms; ii) whole-language properties, e.g., that [[programming language|languages]] satisfy [[parametricity]], enforce information flow policies, or guarantee privacy; and iii) properties of implementations, e.g., compiler correctness. (from [Johann-Ghani](#JohannGhani)).
