## Idea

An *apartness space* is a set equipped with an "apartness relation" that distinguishes between pairs of points or sets.  They are particularly interesting in [[constructive mathematics]]; in [[classical mathematics]] they tend to be equivalent to better-known definitions expressed in terms of "closeness" rather than "apartness".

## Definitions

There are actually three different notions of "apartness space" depending on whether the objects being compared on each side are points or sets.

* A **point-point apartness space** is a set $X$ equipped with an [[apartness relation]], usually written $x # y$ on elements $x,y\in X$.  Sometimes it is required to be [[tight relation|tight]], or to be only an [[inequality relation]].

* A **set-set apartness space** is a set $X$ equipped with a relation $A\bowtie B$ between [[subsets]] $A,B\subseteq X$, satisfying appropriate axioms.  In [[classical mathematics]], a set-set apartness space is equivalent to a [[proximity space]].  In [[constructive mathematics]], the classical definition of a proximity space in terms of $\bowtie$ can be taken as a definition of a set-set apartness space.

* A **point-set apartness space** is a set $X$ equipped with a relation $x \bowtie A$ between points $x\in X$ and subsets $A\subseteq X$, satisfying appropriate axioms.  In classical mathematics, these axioms are obtained by [[contrapositive|contraposition]] from the definition of a [[topological space]] in terms of a [[exact functor|right exact]] [[Moore closure]] operator, so that point-set apartness spaces are equivalent to topological spaces.  In constructive mathematics

Since point-point apartness spaces are described at [[apartness relation]], and set-set apartness spaces at [[proximity space]], the rest of this page will be about point-set apartness spaces.

### Point-set apartness spaces

###### Definition
A **point-set apartness space** is a set $X$ equipped with a relation $\bowtie$ between points $x\in X$ and subsets $A\subseteq X$ such that

1. if $x\bowtie A$, then $x\notin A$.
2. $x\bowtie (A\cup B)$ iff $x\bowtie A$ and $x\bowtie B$.
3. If $x \bowtie A$, and $\forall y, (y\bowtie A \to y\notin B)$, then $x\bowtie B$.
=--

The relation $x\bowtie A$ should be regarded as a "positive" way of saying that $x$ does not belong to the [[closure]] of $A$, i.e. $x\notin \overline{A}$.  Under this interpretation, the above axioms contrapose to become

1. If $x\in A$, then $x\in \overline{A}$, i.e. $A\subseteq \overline{A}$.
1. $\overline{A} \cup \overline{B} = \overline{A\cup B}$ (and in particular $(A\subseteq B) \to (\overline{A}\subseteq \overline{B})$).
1. If $B\subseteq \overline{A}$ and $x\in \overline{B}$, then $x\in\overline{A}$, i.e. $\overline{\overline{A}} = \overline{A}$.

which are precisely the axioms of a [[topology]] expressed in terms of a closure operator.  In constructive mathematics, of course, the law of contraposition does not hold.

## Separation properties

Any point-set apartness space comes with an [[irreflexive relation]] $\lt$ defined by $x \lt y$ iff $y\bowtie \{x\}$.  This is a positive version of the negation of the [[specialization order]].  Just as a topological space is called $T_1$ (see [[separation axioms]]) if its specialization order is discrete, i.e. $(x\le y) \to (x=y)$, we may call a point-set apartness space **$T_1$** if the contrapositive of this holds, i.e. $(x\neq y) \to (x \bowtie \{y\})$.  In fact it is often more useful to replace $\neq$ here by a given [[apartness relation]] or [[inequality relation]] $#$ on $X$, and in this context we can also replace $y\notin B$ in the third axiom with $\forall z\in B, (y # z)$.

A point-set apartness space may be called **comparable** (nonce definition on this page) if $x\bowtie A$ implies $(x\neq y) \vee (y\bowtie A)$ for any $y$, where $\neq$ might also be a given apartness on $X$.  This condition is classically trivial, and generalizes the [[comparison]] axiom on a point-point [[apartness relation]].  It is also related topologically to Penon's definition of intrinsic [[open subset]] in [[synthetic topology]], and can also be viewed as a very weak version of [[regular space|regularity]].

[Bridges et al](#BSV) define point-set apartness spaces to always be both $T_1$ and comparable, with respect to a given inequality on $X$.
