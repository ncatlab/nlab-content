## Definition

The **[[circle]] [[group]]** $\mathbb{T}$ is equivalently ([[isomorphism|isomorphically]])

* the [[quotient group]] $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ of the additive group of [[real numbers]] by the additive group of [[integers]], induced by the canonical embedding $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$;

* the [[unitary group]] $\mathrm{U}(1)$;

* the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(2)$;

* the [[subgroup]] of the group $\mathbb{C}^\times$ of units  of the [[field]] of [[complex numbers]] given by those of any fixed positive modulus (standardly $1$).


## Properties

For general abstract properties usually the first characterization is the most important one. Notably it implies that the circle group fits into a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{T} \to 0
  \,,
$$

the "real [[exponential exact sequence]]".

(On the other hand, the last characterization is usually preferred when one wants to be concrete.)

A [[character]] of an [[abelian group]] $A$ is simply a [[homomorphism]] from $A$ to the circle group.

$U(1)$ is the compact [[real form]] of the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathbb{G}_m = \mathbb{C}^\times$ over the [[complex numbers]], see at _[form of an algebraic group -- Circle group and multiplicative group](form+of+an+algebraic+group#MultiplicativeAndCircleGroup)_.


## Related concepts

A [[principal bundle]] with structure group the circle group is a [[circle bundle]]. The canonically corresponding [[associated bundle]] under the standard [[representation]] of $U(1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a complex [[line bundle]].
