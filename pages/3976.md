## Definition

The **circle [[group]]** $S^1$ is equivalently ([[isomorphism|isomorphically]])

* the [[quotient]] $\mathbb{R}/ \mathbb{Z}$ of the additive group of [[real number]]s by the additive group of [[integer]]s, induced by the canonical embedding $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$;

* the [[unitary group]] $U(1)$;

* the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(2)$;

* the subgroup of the group $\mathbb{C}^\times$ of units  of the [[complex number]]s given by those of any fixed positive modulus.

## Properties

For general abstract properties usually the first characterization is the most important one. Notably it implies that the circle group fits into a [[short exact sequence]]

A [[principal bundle]] with structure group the circle group is a [[circle bundle]]. The canonically corresponding [[associated bundle]] under the standard [[representation]] of $S^1 \simeq U(1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a complex [[line bundle]].
