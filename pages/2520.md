## Idea

In [[physics]] the dynamics of a system may be encoded by a [[functional]] -- called the **action functional** -- on its [[space]] of [[path space object|paths]] in its [[configuration space]]:

* in [[classical mechanics]] and [[classical field theory]] -- by the **action principle** or **principle of least action** -- the extrema of the action functional -- obtained by [[variational calculus]] and given by [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s -- encode the physically observable configurations  ;

* in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] the evolution of the [[quantum state]]s is encoded by the integral -- the [[path integral]] -- of the exponentiated action functional over the space of field configurations.

For emphasis the description of dynamics by action functionals is called the **Lagrangean** approach. Another forumlation of dynamics in physics that does not involve an action functional explicitly is [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] on [[phase space]]. At least in certain classes of cases the relation and equivalence of both approaches is understood. Generally the formulation of [[quantum field theory]] in terms of action functionals suffers from a lack of precise understanding of what the [[path integral]] over the action functional really means. 


## Action functional as a local functional


The action functional is normally obtained by integrating the [[Lagrangean]] function along the path; in the case of a continuum system, the Lagrangean function is obtained by integrating the Lagrangean density on space.  For a more manifestly [[relativity|relativistic]] formulation, we may obtain the action functional by integrating the Lagrangean density on [[spacetime]].

1. $ S(q) = \int_a^b L(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}t $, where $q$ is a path through configuration space, on the time interval $[a,b]$, with derivative $\dot{q} = \mathrm{d}q/\mathrm{d}t$.  When minimising the action, we fix the values of $q(a)$ and $q(b)$.
2. $ L(q,\dot{q}) = \int_{S} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z $, where now $q$ is a configuration of fields on $S$, which is a region of space.  We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of $S$ (typically that $q$ and $\dot{q}$ go to zero if $S$ is all of space).
3. $ S(q) = \int_{R} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t $, where now $q$ is a configuration of fields on $R$, which a region of spacetime, with time derivative $\dot{q} = \partial{q}/\partial{t}$.  We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of $R$.

The formulation of (3) above is still not manifestly coordinate indepdendent.  However, $\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t$ is simply the [[volume form]] on spacetime and $\dot{q}$ is merely one choice of coordinate on [[state space]] and could just as easily be replaced by a derivative with respect to any timelike coordinate on spacetime (or drop coordinates altogether).
