Any [[abelian category]] $C$ gives rise to an abelian group $K(C)$ called its [[Grothendieck group]].  If we apply this construction to a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] abelian category, $K(C)$ is a [[ring]], called the **Grothendieck ring**.

If $C$ is a [[braided monoidal category]], $K(C)$ becomes a [[commutative ring]].

If $C$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]], $K(C)$ becomes a $\Lambda$-[[Lambda-ring|ring]] --- even better.

If $C$ is just braided monoidal, is $K(C)$ just a commutative ring?
