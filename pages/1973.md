Any [[abelian category]] $C$ gives rise to an abelian group $K(C)$ called its [[Grothendieck group]].  If we apply this construction to a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] abelian category, $K(C)$ is a ring, called the **Grothendieck ring**.

If $C$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]], $K(C)$ becomes a commutative ring --- but even better, it becomes a [[Lambda-ring]].

What if $C$ is just braided monoidal?  Maybe then $K(C)$ is just a commutative ring.

For the Grothendieck ring of higher Artin stacks, see Toen: Anneaux de Grothendieck etc, file Toen web prepr K-champ.pdf. For special Artin stacks, he shows by comparing this ring to the ordinary Grothendieck ring of varieties, that invariants such as Hodge numbers and Euler characteristics (l-adic and motivic) extend uniquely to special Artin stacks. In particular, get Lefschetz trace formula for such stacks.
