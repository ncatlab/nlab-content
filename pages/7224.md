## Idea ##

Relative adjoints with respect to a functor $J$ are a generalization of [[adjoint functor|adjoints]], where $J$ in the relative case plays the role of the identity in the standard setting: adjoints are the same as $Id$-relative adjoints.

## Definition ##

### hom-isomorphism definition ###

Fix a functor $J\colon B \to D$. Then, a functor 

\[
	R \colon C \to D
\] 

has a _left $J$-relative adjoint_ (or $J$-left adjoint) if there is a functor 

\[ 
	L \colon B \to C
\]

and a natural isomorphism

\[
	Hom_C(L(-),-) \simeq Hom_D(J(-),R(-))
\]

Dually, $L \colon C \to D$ has a _$J$-right adjoint_ $R \colon B \to C$ if there's a natural isomorphism

\[
	 Hom_D(L(-), J(-)) \simeq Hom_C(-, R(-))
\]

#### Notation ####

- $L {\,\,}_J\!\dashv R$ stands for $L$ being the $J$-left adjoint of $R$
- $L \dashv_J R$ stands for $R$ being the $J$-right adjoint of $L$

## Properties ##

### asymmetry ###

The most important difference with regular adjunctions is the asymmetry of the concept. First, for $L {\,\,}_J\!\dashv R$ it makes no sense to ask for $R \dashv_J L$ (domains and comodomains do not typecheck). And secondly, and more importantly:

* **$L$ is $J$-left adjoint to $R$:** $R$ _determines_ $L$ 
* **$R$ is $J$-right adjoint to $L$:** $L$ _determines_ $R$

Because of this, even if most of the properties of adjunctions have a generalization to the relative setting, they do that in a one-sided way.

### relative monads and comonads ###

Just as adjunctions give rise to [[monad|monads]] and [[comonad|comonads]], for relative adjoints

1. If $L {\,\,}_J\!\dashv R$, then $RL$ is a [[relative monad]]
2. If $L \dashv_J R$, then $LR$ is a [[relative comonad]]

and there are relative analogues of [[Eilenberg-Moore category|Eilenberg-Moore]] and [[Kleisli category|Kleisli]] categories for these.

## Examples ##

- _partially defined adjoints_ as remarked in the [[adjoint functor|local definition of adjoint functor]], given a functor 
\[
	L \colon C \to D
\]
it may happen that $Hom_D(L(-),d)$ is [[representable functor|representable]] only for _some_ $d$, but not for all of them. In that case, taking 
\[
	J \colon B \to D
\]
be the inclusion of the [[full subcategory|full subcategory]] determined by $Hom_D(L(-),d)$ representable, and defining $R \colon B \to C$ accordingly, we have
\[
	L \dashv_J R
\]
This can be specialized to situations such as a category having _some_ but not all [[limit|limits]] of some kind, partially defined [[Kan extension|Kan extensions]], etc.  See also [[free object]].
