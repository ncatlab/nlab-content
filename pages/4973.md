## Idea

Given a geometric morphism $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{S}$, we can regard $\mathcal{E}$ as a *[[topos]] [[base topos|over]] $\mathcal{S}$* via $f$.  The geometric morphism $f$ being *bounded* is the "over $\mathcal{S}$" version of $\mathcal{E}$ being a [[Grothendieck topos]].

## Definition

A [[geometric morphism]] $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{S}$ between [[topos]]es is called **bounded** if there exists an object  $B \in \mathcal{E}$ -- called a **bound** of $f$ -- such that for every $A \in \mathcal{E}$ the following equivalent conditions hold:

* $A$ is a [[subquotient]] of an object of the form $(f^* I) \times B$ for some $I  \in \mathcal{S}$: this means that there exists a diagram

  $$
    \array{
      S &\stackrel{epi}{\to}& A
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{mono}}\downarrow  
      \\
      (f^* I) \times B
    }
    \,.
  $$

* (one more)

* (yet one more)

If we regard $\mathcal{E}$ as a topos over $\mathcal{S}$ via $f$, then when $f$ is bounded we call $\mathcal{E}$ a **bounded $\mathcal{S}$-topos**.

## Properties

If $f := \Gamma\colon \mathcal{E}\to Set$ is the [[global section]] geometric morphism of a topos (such a geometric morphism being unique if it exists), then it is bounded if and only if $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]]. As such we can also call Grothendieck toposes "bounded $Set$-toposes".

More generally, bounded toposes over $\mathcal{S}$ are precisely the toposes of $\mathcal{S}$-valued sheaves on internal sites in $\mathcal{S}$ (see Section B3.3 in the [[Elephant]]).

If $f:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$ is bounded and $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], then $\mathcal{E}$ is a Grothendieck topos as well. This is a consequence of the following.

###### Proposition

Bounded geometric morphisms are stable under composition.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume that $f : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{S}$ is bounded by $B\in\mathcal{F}$, and  $g:\mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{F}$ is bounded by $C\in\mathcal{G}$. Let $A\in\mathcal{G}$. Then there exist $J\in \mathcal{F}$ and $I\in\mathcal{S}$, and  subquotient spans
$A\leftarrow\bullet\rightarrow g^*J\times C$ and $J\leftarrow\bullet\rightarrow f^*I\times B$. By applying $g^*(-)\times C$ to the second subquotient and forming a pullback, we get the diagram
$$
\begin{matrix}
\bullet & \to & \bullet & \to A \\
\downarrow && \downarrow \\
\bullet & \rightarrow & g*J\times C \\
\downarrow \\
g^*f^* I\times g^* B \times C
\end{matrix}
$$
where the vertical arrows are monos and the horizontal ones are epis (using the fact that epis are stable under $g^*$, products, and pullbacks), from which we can see that $f g$ is bounded by $g^*B\times C$.

Almost all geometric morphisms in practice are bounded, so that often when people work in the 2-category [[Topos]] of toposes and geometric morphisms, they mean that the geometric morphisms are bounded. See [[unbounded topos]] for the few examples of unbounded geometric morphisms.
