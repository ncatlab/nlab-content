## Idea

Given a geometric morphism $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{S}$, we can regard $\mathcal{E}$ as a *[[topos]] [[base topos|over]] $\mathcal{S}$* via $f$.  The geometric morphism $f$ being *bounded* is the "over $\mathcal{S}$" version of $\mathcal{E}$ being a [[Grothendieck topos]].

## Definition

A [[geometric morphism]] $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{S}$ between [[topos]]es is called **bounded** if there exists an object  $B \in \mathcal{E}$ -- called a **bound** of $f$ -- such that for every $A \in \mathcal{E}$ the following equivalent conditions hold:

* $A$ is a [[subquotient]] of a subobject, $S$, of an object of the form $(f^* I) \times B$ for some $I  \in \mathcal{S}$: this means that there exists a diagram

  $$
    \array{
      S &\stackrel{epi}{\to}& A
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{mono}}\downarrow  
      \\
      (f^* I) \times B
    }
    \,.
  $$

* (one more)

* (yet one more)

If we regard $\mathcal{E}$ as a topos over $\mathcal{S}$ via $f$, then when $f$ is bounded we call $\mathcal{E}$ a **bounded $\mathcal{S}$-topos**.

## Properties

If $f := \Gamma\colon \mathcal{E}\to Set$ is the [[global section]] geometric morphism of a topos (such a geometric morphism being unique if it exists), then it is bounded if and only if $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]]. As such we can also call Grothendieck toposes "bounded $Set$-toposes".

Almost all geometric morphisms in practice are bounded, so that often when people work in the 2-category [[Topos]] of toposes and geometric morphisms, they mean that the geometric morphisms are bounded. See [[unbounded topos]] for the few examples of unbounded geometric morphisms.
