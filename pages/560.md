## Idea 

The idea of the following text is to begin with a category of objects presumed [[undirected object|undirected]] and construct from that a supercategory of directed objects, analogous to how [[Marco Grandis]] developed [[directed space|directed topological spaces]] out of the usual undirected ones.

(Rather different approaches to a notion of "directed object" will exist. See also at _[[directed homotopy theory]]_ and _[[directed homotopy type theory]]_.)

## Definition (tentative) 

Let $C$ be a category with an [[interval object]] $I$, and suppose that every object $X$ of $C$ is $I$-[[undirected object|undirected]].

To be explicit, fix a subset
$
  d_I \subset {}_{pt}hom(I,I)_{pt}
$
of the endomorphisms of the given [[interval object]] $I$ regarded as a cospan $pt \to I \leftarrow pt$ to be called the _directed endomorphisms_ of the interval object.

Then let an **$I$-directed object** of $C$ be an object $X$ of $C$ equipped with a [[subset]] $d$ or $d_X$ of the [[hom-set]] $I \to C$; elements of $d$ are called **directed paths** in $(X, d)$.  The directed paths must satisfy these conditions (following Grandis):
1. (constant paths) every map $I \to \pt \to X$ is directed;
2. (reparametrisation) For $\gamma \in d_X \subset hom(I,X)$  and every $\phi \in d_I \subset hom(I,I)$, also $\gamma \circ \phi$  is in $d_X$;
3. (concatenation) if $a, b: I \to X$ are consecutive in the sense that $\pt \to^{\tau} I \to^{a} X$ equals $\pt \to^{\sigma} I \to^{b} X$, then their concatenate $I \to X$ (which exists by the pushout properties of an interval object) is a directed path.

A morphism of such directed objects is a morphism of their underlying objects that preserves directed paths.  This defines a category $d_I{C}$ of which the original $C$ is a subcategory.


## Examples 

* The category of [[directed space|directed topological spaces]] according to Grandis is of the above form $d_I{C}$ for $C = $ [[Top]], $I = [0,1]$ and $d_I = \{monotonic maps I \to I\}$.
