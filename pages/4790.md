
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **symplectic group** $Sp(2n)$ is one of the [[classical Lie group]]s.

It is the subgroup of the [[general linear group]] $GL(2n)$ of elements preserving the canonical [[symplectic form]] $\Omega$ on $k^{2n}$, that is: the group consisting of those [[matrices]] $A$ such that

$$
  A^T \Omega A = \Omega
  \,.
