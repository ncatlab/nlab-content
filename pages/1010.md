#Idea#

Problems of set theory arise by unjustified recursion of the naive notion of collection. If "Col"s are one notion of collections, then the notion "Col of all Cols" is in general problematic, since it is subject to the construction of Russel-style paradoxes. 

One way out is to consider a hierarchy of notions of collections: postulate that the collection of all "Col"s is not a "Col" itself, but is another notion of collection, a "Col+": the "Col+ of all Cols". Similarly, the collection of all "Col+"-type collections may be taken to be a "Col++", and so on.

One formalization of this idea is that of a _Grothendieck universe_: this is defined to be a set $U$ which behaves like a "set+ of all sets" in that all the standard operations of set theory (union, intersection, etc.) can be performed on its elements. 




#Definition#

A **Grothendieck universe** $U$ is a [[set]] $U$ such that


* $(u \in U) \Rightarrow (u \subset U)$;

* $(u, v  \in U) \Rightarrow (\{u, v\} \in U)$;

* $(u \in U) \Rightarrow (P(u) \in U)$

* for all $I \in U$ and functions $F : I \to U$, the union $\cup_{i \in I} F(i)$ exists in $U$.

Here $P(u)$ is the power set of the set $u$.

Some authors (for instance [[Categories and Sheaves|Kashiwara-Shapira]]) add

* $\emptyset \in U$;

* $\mathbb{N} \in U$.

#Remark#


When working with Grothendieck universes one usually adds the following axiom to the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory:

* For every set $s$ there exists a universe which contains $s$, i.e. such that $s \in U$.

This way whenever any operation leads one outside of a given Grothendieck universe (see applications below) one there is guaraneteed to be a bigger Grothendieck universe in which one lands.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: unless I am missing something, the Grothendieck universe approach goes right against Lawvere's attitude to set theory as reviewed and emphasized at [[Trimble on ETCS I]]: that it is unnatural to consider membership of sets as a global relation, i.e. to handle sets and their elements on the same footing. On the contrary, for the above definition to even make sense, we have to assume that "everything is a set" (becuase the above definition tacitly assume that every element of a Grothendieck universe is itself a set). 

So what is the analog of Grothendieck universes, or of what they accomplish in practice, in [[ETCS]]? How are the applications mentioned below handled in [[ETCS]] without use of Grothendieck universes?

#Applications#

#Presheaf categories#

Let $U$ be a Grothendieck universe and $U-Set$ the category of $U$-small sets. 
Let $C = pt$ be the terminal category (single object, single morphism). Then the collection of objects of the $U$-[[presheaf]] category (the [[functor category]] $[C^{op}, U-Set]]$ is the collection of all $U$-sets. This is itself not a $U$-small set. Hence $[C^{op}, U-Set]$ is a $U$-[[large category]].

The same conclusion then manifestly remains true when $C$ is replaced by an arbitrary non-empty category $C$: the functor category $[C^{op}, U-Set]$ is never $U$-small. 

Moreover, if $C$ is not $U$-small, then $[C^{op},U-Set]$ is not even a $U$-category (i.e. [[enriched category|enriched in]] $U$-sets). (However if $C$ is $U$-small, then $[C^{op}, U-Set]$ is a $U$-category.)
