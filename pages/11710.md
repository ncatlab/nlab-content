## Definition

A _maximal ideal_ (in say a [[commutative ring]] $R$) is an [[ideal]] $M$ which is maximal among [[proper ideals]]. (This is a second-order definition, as it quantifies over subsets of $R$.) 

Equivalently, an ideal $M \subseteq R$ is maximal if the [[quotient]] ring $R/M$ is a [[field]]. This suggests a [[first-order logic|first-order]] definition: an ideal $M$ is maximal if $(\forall_x)\; \neg (x \in M) \Rightarrow \exists_y x y = 1$. 

## Properties

### Relation to points in the spectrum

Maximal ideals in the [[spectrum of a commutative ring]] $Spec(R)$ correspond precisely to the [[closed subset|closed]] points in the [[Zariski topology]] on $Spec(R)$.
