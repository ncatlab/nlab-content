## Definition

The **law of double negation** is the statement that the [[double negation]] of a [[proposition]] [[implication|implies]] that proposition

$$
  \not \not A \Rightarrow A
  \,.
$$

In [[classical mathematics]], this is simply true.  In [[constructive mathematics]], it is equivalent to the law of [[excluded middle]], and is not assertable in general.
