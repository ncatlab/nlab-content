## Definition ## 

A **fusion category** is a [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]] [[semisimple category|semisimple]] [[linear category|linear]] ([[Vect]]-[[enriched category|enriched]]) [[monoidal category]], with only finitely many [[decategorification|isomorphism classes]] of simple objects, such that the [[endomorphism]]s of the unit object form just the [[ground field]] $k$.


## Remarks ##

The name "fusion category" comes from the central examples of structures whose canonical [[tensor product]] is called a "fusion product", notably [[representation]]s of [[loop group]]s and of [[Hopf algebra]]s and of [[vertex operator algebra]]s. 

Fusion categories were first systematically studied by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik in [On fusion categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203060). This paper listed many examples and proved many properties of fusion categories. One of the important conjectures made in that paper was the following:

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Conjecture (Etingof, Nikshcych and Ostrik)

Every fusion category admits a [[pivotal structure]].
=--

Providing a certain condition is satisfied, a pivotal structure on a fusion category can be shown to correspond to a 'twisted' monoidal natural transformation of the identity functor on the category, where the twisting is given by the [[pivotal symbols]].


## Suggestions ##

Here are three things such that it'd be awesome if they were sorted out on this page:

1. Kuperberg's theorem saying that [[abelian category|abelian]] semisimple implies [[linear category|linear]] over some field. [Finite, connected, semisimple, rigid tensor categories are linear](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0209256)

2. Some correct version of the claim that abelian semisimple is the same as [[idempotent complete category|idempotent complete]] and nondegenerate. [Math Overflow question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/245/are-abelian-nondegenerate-tensor-categories-semisimple)

3. Good notation distinguishing [[simple object|simple]] versus [[absolutely simple object|absolutely simple]] (is $End(V) = k$ or just $V$ has no nontrivial proper subobjects).

Together 1 and 2 let you go between the two different obvious notions of semisimple which seem a bit muddled here when I clicked through the links.
