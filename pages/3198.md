An **urelement**, also called an **atom**, in a [[material set theory]] is a thing which is not a [[set]].  Many common material set theories, such as [[ZFC]], do not by default allow urelements; thus everything is a set and all sets are [[pure set|pure]].  However, they can usually be easily modified to allow urelements.
