[[!include all changes]]


All non-trivial additions or changes to the $n$Lab should briefly be indicated here. This way [[Contributors|the rest of us]] can spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

+-- {: .standout}

Please log all your non-trivial changes to the $n$Lab here!

=--

Here "non-trivial" means: anything that any other contributor might be interested in taking notice of. If you fix a trivial typo in the text somewhere, that is highly appreciated but unlikely to be controversial and hence need not be logged here. But already if you fix a typo in some _formula_, it may be of interest. Generally: the more you log your activity here, the better. Even when in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in changes you made, drop a note here on what you did.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list.

## 2009-08-03

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: 

  *  created [[(infinity,1)-quantity]] -- some comments:

     * this accompanies a blog question [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/08/question_on_synthetic_differen.html)

     * among other things this aims to provide the full general nonsense $\infty$-version of the statement at the beginning of [[differential form]]

     * I could move this to my private web. Let me know if you feel that would be better.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[crossed profunctor]] (of crossed modules) and [[butterfly]] (pappilon). First after M. Jibladze (1990) and second after B. Noohi (2005). I did not draw the diagram but wrote equations explicitly. I have the file of the book where Jibladze's paper is if somebody needs it. 
* [[Eric]]:

  * Gleefully responded to John's gleeful response on [[directed graph]]. Note: I need to learn about this 'resolution' stuff.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[reconstruction theorem]]. There should eventually be separate entries for each of the main classes and examples, which are listed in the main entry.
* [[Urs Schreiber]]: 

  * added something on the dual Dold-Kan correspondence relating _co_ -chain complexes and co-simplicial abelian groups to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].

  * renamed differentials at [[chain complex]] from "$d$" to "$\partial$"

  * expanded [[cochain complex]]

  * created [[differential forms in synthetic differential geometry]] with two purposes: it reviews the definition found in the literature and then proposes a -- supposedly nicer -- reformulation

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: added a query in [[compact object]]: the stated characterization of categories of $R$-modules is known at least about 3 decades before Ginzburg's lectures. Maybe we should look into classical sources.
* [[John Baez]]: 

   * Added theorem characterizing categories of $R$-modules to [[compact object]].

   * Added same theorem and also the Mitchell embedding theorem to [[abelian category]].

   * Gleefully shot down an idea of Eric's over at [[directed graph]] --- but this idea can be resuscitated using the concept of 'resolution'.

* [[Sridhar Ramesh]] added a small note that [[Lawvere-Tierney topology|Lawvere-Tierney topologies]] are the same as (internal) closure operators on truth values (Being new here, I'm not exactly sure what the protocols are; in "Please log all your non-trivial changes", does "non-trivial" mean everything above, say, typo-correction?). I also observed, in the article on [[presheaf|presheaves]], that the representable presheaves on a category of presheaves are precisely those which turn colimits into limits (i.e., a functor of type $[C, Set]^{op} \to Set$ is representable just in case it is limit-preserving).

  * [[Urs Schreiber]]: I added a remark to the text above on what "non-trivial" means. Generally, I think you can't log too much of your activity here, just too little. So if in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in your changes or not, drop a note here.

*  [[John Baez]]: Welcome, Sridhar Ramesh!  I'd like to add: we are not trying to force you to do lots of bureaucratic work, so please don't feel we are _demanding_ you to log changes here.  If you make a change and feel too tired to log it here, we won't be mad at you.  We just _like_ to see changes here, even smallish ones.

* [[Eric]]: Asked a question of [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] (or anyone else interested in SDG) at [[synthetic differential geometry]].

## 2009-08-01

*  [[Sridhar Ramesh]] has joined, editing [[module]] and [[Mitchell-Benabou language]] so far.

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: replied and reacted at  [[differential form]]

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:

   *  Archived the [[2009 July changes]].  (Check there if you missed some ... which you did, I promise.)
   *  More discussion with [[Rafael Borowiecki]] at [[category theory]].
   *  Answered one of two un-logged questions by [[Jim Stasheff]] at the bottom of [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]].
   *  Asked Urs a question at [[differential form]].
