[[!include all changes]]


All non-trivial additions or changes to the $n$Lab should briefly be indicated here. This way [[Contributors|the rest of us]] can spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

+-- {: .standout}

Please log all your non-trivial changes to the $n$Lab here!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list.

## 2009-08-03

* [[Sridhar Ramesh]] added a small note that [[Lawvere-Tierney topology|Lawvere-Tierney topologies]] are the same as (internal) closure operators on truth values (Being new here, I'm not exactly sure what the protocols are; in "Please log all your non-trivial changes", does "non-trivial" mean everything above, say, typo-correction?)

* [[Eric]]: Asked a question of [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] (or anyone else interested in SDG) at [[synthetic differential geometry]].

## 2009-08-01

*  [[Sridhar Ramesh]] has joined, editing [[module]] and [[Mitchell-Benabou language]] so far.

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: while [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] has the page on [[differential form]]s locked, I'll drop my reply to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] here (to be moved over there later):

  1. I like the reformatting. The beginning of the entry looks good now. 

  2. The orientation of the diffential form corresponds to the inherent orientation of [[k-morphism]]s: as we identify the differential form with a smooth functor on the [[path n-groupoid]], that [[path n-groupoid]] necessarily has _oriented_ $k$-volumes as its [[k-morphism]]s, simply because these $k$-morphisms need to come with information about their (higher categorical) source and target.

  3. To get pseudo-differential forms that may be integrated also over non-oriented and possibly non-orientable manifolds one needs to consider parallel transport functors not with coefficients in just $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$ coming from the [[crossed complex]] 
     
     $$
        (\mathbb{R} \to {*} \to \cdots \to {*})
     $$

     but the more refined crossed complex

     $$
        (\mathbb{R} \to {*} \to \cdots \to \mathbb{Z}_2)
     $$

     where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-factor acts by sign reversal on $\mathbb{R}$ (one can also use $U(1)$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$, this way $[P_n(-), \mathbf{B}^n U(1)]$ becomes the [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne complex]] and knows not just about differential forms but about $U(1)$ $n-1$-gerbes with connection even).

     A little bit of discussion of this unoriented case is currently at [[orientifold]]. There for the case $n=2$.


*  [[Toby Bartels]]:

   *  Archived the [[2009 July changes]].  (Check there if you missed some ... which you did, I promise.)
   *  More discussion with [[Rafael Borowiecki]] at [[category theory]].
   *  Answered one of two un-logged questions by [[Jim Stasheff]] at the bottom of [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]].
   *  Asked Urs a question at [[differential form]].
