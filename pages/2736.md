#### Terminal Object

+-- {: .standout}
Any [[singleton]] (a one-element set) is a [[terminal object]] in $Set$.
=--

To prove this, let $C$ be any set, let $\bullet$ be a singleton, and let $*$ be the element of $\bullet$.

Then there is a unique function ${!}\colon C \to \bullet$, defined by
$$ {!}(z) = * $$
for any element $z$ of $C$.

Therefore, any singleton is a terminal object in $Set$.

Now let $\bullet'$ be another singleton with element $*'$ and $f:\bullet'\to\bullet$ be the obvious bijection $f(*') = *$, and ${!}'\colon C \to \bullet'$ be any function. Then
$$ f\circ {!}'(z) = * = {!}(z)$$
for any element $z$ of $C$, so ${!} = f\circ {!}'$.

[[Eric]]: How is this this universal cone over the empty diagram?

_Toby_:  It seems to me that this is really a question about terminal objects in general than about terminal objects in $Set$.  A cone over the empty diagram is simply an object, and a morphism of cones over the empty diagram is simply a morphism.  A universal cone over a diagram $J$ is a cone $T$ over $J$ such that, given any cone $C$, there is a unique cone morphism from $C$ to $T$.  So a univeral cone over the empty diagram is an object $T$ such that, given any object $C$, there is a unique morphism from $C$ to $T$.  In other words, a universal cone over the empty diagram is a terminal object.

I don\'t see the point of the last paragraph before this query box.  Already at the end of the previous paragraph, we\'ve proved that $\bullet$ is a terminal object, since there is a unique function (morphism) to $\bullet$ from any set (object) $C$.  It almost looks like you wrote that paragraph by modifying the paragraph that *I* had written in that place, but that paragraph did something different: it proved that ${!}$ was unique.  Apparently, you thought that this was obvious, since you simply added the word 'unique' to the previous paragraph.

Alternatively, if you *want* to keep a paragraph that proves unicity, then you can remove 'unique' and rewrite my original unicity proof in terminology more like yours, as follows:
> Now let ${!}'\colon C \to \bullet$ be any function. Then
> $$ {!}'(z) = * = {!}(z)$$
> for any element $z$ of $C$, so ${!}' = {!}$.

#### Binary Products

+--{: .standout}
The [[cartesian product]] is the [[product]] in $Set$.
=--

Given two sets $A$ and $B$, recall that the [[cartesian product]] $A \times B$ of $A$ and $B$ is the set of [[ordered pairs]] $\langle{x,y}\rangle$ for $x$ in $A$ and $y$ in $B$.  There is a [[product]] of $A$ and $B$ in $Set$ that consists of
*  $A \times B$,
*  the left projection $\pi_{A,B}\colon A \times B \to A$ given by $\pi_{A,B} (\langle{x,y}\rangle) = x$, and
*  the right projection $\rho_{A,B}\colon A \times B \to B$ given by $\rho_{A,B} (\langle{x,y}\rangle) = y$.

To prove this, let $C$ be any set, and let $f\colon C \to A$ and $g\colon C \to B$ be functions.  Then there is a function $\langle{f,g}\rangle\colon C \to A \times B$ (the [[pairing]] of $f$ and $g$), defined by
$$ \langle{f,g}\rangle(z) = \langle{f(z),g(z)}\rangle $$
for any element $z$ of $C$.  Notice that $\pi_{A,B} \circ \langle{f,g}\rangle = f$, because
$$ \pi_{A,B}(\langle{f,g}\rangle(z)) = \pi_{A,B}(\langle{f(z),g(z)}) = f(z) $$
for any element $z$ of $C$, and $\rho_{A,B} \circ \langle{f,g}\rangle = g$, because
$$ \rho_{A,B}(\langle{f,g}\rangle(z)) = \rho_{A,B}(\langle{f(z),g(z)}\rangle) = g(z) $$
for any element $z$ of $C$.

Now let $v\colon C \to A \times B$ be any function such that $\pi_{A,B} \circ v = f$ and $\rho_{A,B} \circ v = g$.  Notice that, for any element $z$ of $G$, $v(z) = \langle{x,y}\rangle$ for some $x$ in $A$ and $y$ in $B$, since every element of $A \times B$ takes this form.  Then
$$ x = \pi_{A,B}(\langle{x,y}\rangle) = \pi_{A,B}(v(z)) = f(z) $$
and
$$ y = \rho_{A,B}(\langle{x,y}\rangle) = \rho_{A,B}(v(z)) = g(z) ,$$
so
$$ v(z) = \langle{x,y}\rangle = \langle{f(z),g(z)}\rangle = \langle{f,g}\rangle(z) $$
for every element $z$ of $C$, so $v = \langle{f,g}\rangle$.

Therefore, $A \times B$, when equipped with the projections $\pi_{A,B}\colon A \times B \to A$ and $\rho_{A,B}\colon A \times B \to B$, is a product of $A$ and $B$ in $Set$.

#### Arbitrary Small Products

Given a [[family]] of sets $\langle{A_i}\rangle_i$, recall that the [[cartesian product]] $\prod_i A_i$ of $\langle{A_i}\rangle_i$ is the set of [[tuples]] $\langle{x_i}\rangle_i$ with, for each index $i$, $x_i$ in $A_i$.  There is a [[product]] of $\langle{A_i}\rangle_i$ in $Set$ that consists of
*  $\prod_i A_i$ and,
*  for each index $j$, the $j$th projection $\pi_j\colon \prod_i A_i \to A_j$ given by $\pi_j (\langle{x_i}\rangle_i) = x_i$.

To prove this, let $C$ be any set, and, for each index $i$, let $f_i\colon C \to A_i$ be a function.  Then ...

I\'ll let you finish this one, Eric.  You can use the binary product as a guide.  Or you can first rewrite the binary product in a way that you like better, then use that as a guide here.  ---Toby

#### Equalizers

The [[equalizer]] of two [[parallel morphisms|parallel functions]] $f,g:X\to Y$ is the subset of $X$ on which both functions coincide, i.e.

$$
  Eq(f,g)
  = 
  \left\{
     s \in c | 
     f(s) = g(s)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Why?

#### Pullbacks

The [[pullback]] of two functions of sets is the set of pairs $(x,y)$ such that $f(x)=g(y)$.
