####Initial Object####

The empty set $\emptyset$ is the [[initial object]] in Set.

Why?

####Terminal Object####

Any one element set is a [[terminal object]] in Set.

Why?

#### Binary Products

The [[product]] in set is the...

Why?

#### Arbitrary Small Products

arbitrary (but small) [[products]]

#### Equalizers

The [[equalizer]] of two functions of sets is the subset of elements on which both functions coincide, i.e.

$$
  Eq(f,g)
  = 
  \left\{
     s \in c | 
     f(s) = g(s)
  \right\}
  \,.
