## Examples

* [[glueballs]] are bound states of [[gluons]]

* [[hadrons]] are bound states of [[quarks]]

  (at temperature high enough that these bound states decay, one speaks of a _[[quark-gluon plasma]]_)

* [[atomic nuclei]] are bound states of certain [[hadrons]], namely of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] ([[nucleons]])

* [[atoms]] are [[bound states]] of [[nucleus (physics)|nuclei]] and [[electrons]]

  (at temperature high enough that these bound states decay, one speaks of a _[[plasma]]_)

* [[molecules]] are bound states of [[atoms]]

* if quarks themselves were bound states (which they are not according to the [[standard model of particle physics]]) then one would call them bound states of _[[preons]]_

* a [[composite Higgs boson]] would be a bound state of a strongly interacting sector beyond the current [[standard model of particle physics]]
