## Examples

The hierarchy of bound states in [[quantum chromodynamics]]:

* if [[quarks]] themselves were bound states (which they are not according to the [[standard model of particle physics]]) then one would call them bound states of _[[preons]]_

* [[hadrons]] are bound states of [[quarks]] 

  (and of [[gluons]], while [[glueballs]] are bound states purely of [[gluons]])

  (at [[temperatures]] that these bound states decay one speaks of a _[[quark gluon plasma]]_)

  * [[mesons]] are bound states specifically of two [[quarks]]

    * [[pions]], [[rho-mesons]] and [[omega-mesons]] are bound states of an [[up quark]] with a [[down quark]]

    * [[kaons]] are bound states of a [[strange quark]] with either an [[up quark]] or a [[down quark]]

    * [[B-mesons]] are bound states of a [[bottom quark]] with either an [[up quark]] or a [[down quark]] or a [[strange quark]] or a [[charm quark]]


  * [[baryons]] are bound states specifically of three [[quarks]], or rather of one [[quark]] and a [[diquark]]

    * [[nuclei]] are bound states of three among the [[up quarks]] and the [[down quarks]]

      * [[protons]] are bound states of 2 [[up quarks]] and 1 [[down quark]]

      * [[neutrons]] are bound states of 1 [[up quarks]] and 2 [[down quark]]

* [[atomic nuclei]] are bound states of of [[nuclei]] ([[protons]] and [[neutrons]])

* [[atoms]] are [[bound states]] of [[atomic nuclei]] and [[electrons]]

  (at temperature high enough that these bound states decay, one speaks of a _[[plasma]]_)

  * in particular [[hydrogen atoms]] are bound states of a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]

* [[molecules]] are bound states of [[atoms]]

Here the last two steps go beyond [[QCD]] as they also involve [[electrons]] from [[quantum electrodynamics]]. 

There are also bound states purely in [[QED]]:

* [[positronium]] is a bound state of an [[electron]] and a [[positron]]

Hypothetically:

* a [[composite Higgs boson]] would be a bound state of a strongly interacting sector beyond the current [[standard model of particle physics]]
