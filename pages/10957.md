## Idea

Traditionally in [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]], a _category of being_ is, vaguely, a "kind or way of being" (e.g [WP](#Wikipedia)).

In ([Lawvere 91](#Lawvere91)) is a proposal for a formalization of this idea. Lawvere starts from the [[metaphysics]] as laid out in  ([Hegel 12](#Hegel12)) and first observes that the concept of [[unity of opposites]] which controls the discussion there is usefully formalized by the concept of [[adjoint modalities]]. In a way the simplest example of such is that given by the [[monad]] constant on the [[terminal object]]

$$
  (\emptyset \dashv \ast)
  \,.
$$

One observes that under the identification of Hegelian [[unity of opposites]] with [[adjoint modalities]], this adjoint pair serves well as a formalization of what ([Hegel 12](#Hegel12)) calls the moments of _Nichts_ ([[nothing]]) and _reines Sein_ (pure [[being]]).

Therefore any other [[adjoint modality]] of the form

$$
  \Box \dashv \bigcirc
$$

which necessarily includes the former (as an inclusion of [[modal types]])

$$
  \array{
     \emptyset &\subset& \Box
     \\
     \bot && \bot
     \\
     \ast &\subset& \bigcirc
  }
$$

formalizes a more "determinate" [[being]] ( _[[Dasein]]_ , _Fürsichsein_ in the language of ([Hegel 12](#Hegel12))).

###### Definition

A _category of being_ is a [[category]] with [[initial object]] and [[terminal object]] and equipped with an [[adjoint modality]] $\Box \dashv \bigcirc$, hence with an [[idempotent monad]] $\bigcirc$ on the category which has a [[left adjoint]] $\Box$.

###### Remark

In [[geometry|geometric]] language these are categories equiiped with a notion of [[discrete objects]] and [[codiscrete objects]].

Examples include [[cohesive toposes]], and these are the examples considered in ([Lawvere 91](#Lawvere91)).
