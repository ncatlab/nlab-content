## Idea

The axiom of replacement is one of the 'strong' axioms of [[set theory]].  It is not necessary for formalising 'ordinary' mathematics and does not hold in such basic systems as [[ETCS]].  It is necessary, however, whenever [[recursion|recursively]] constructing a set that is 'larger' than any set known before.

There are many variations on the axiom (which is actually an axiom *schema* in most systems), with names based on 'replacement' and 'collection'.
