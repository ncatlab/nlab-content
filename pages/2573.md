## Idea

The axiom of replacement is one of the 'strong' axioms of [[set theory]].  It is not necessary for formalising 'ordinary' mathematics and does not hold in such basic systems as [[ETCS]].  It is necessary, however, whenever [[recursion|recursively]] constructing a set that is 'larger' than any set known before.

There are many variations on the axiom (which is actually an axiom *schema* in most systems), with names based on 'replacement' and 'collection'.


## Statements

In general, the axiom applies to a binary [[relation]] that relates elements of one [[set]] $A$ to arbitrary sets.  However, we do *not* expect that the relation itself be an object in the theory; really, this is an axiom schema with one axiom for every binary [[predicate]] of the proper form.  We will write it $\phi(x,Y)$, where $x$ stands for an elment of $A$ and $Y$ stands for any set.  (Note that there may well be other free variables in the predicate.)
