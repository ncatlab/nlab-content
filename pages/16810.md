
In [[topology]], the notion of [[topological space]] is generally taken as basic, and other related structures (such as a [[metric]], a [[uniform structure]], etc) are typically seen as [[extra structure]] on that space.  Then it\'s natural to speak of the [[underlying]] topological space of a given metric space etc.

One can take other perspectives.  For example, topological spaces, uniform spaces, and metric spaces can all be viewed as [[quasigauge spaces]] with [[extra property]], and then there is almost no overlap between these.  However, [[Top]] is a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[QGau]], and the underlying topological space of a metric or uniform space is the reflection in $Top$ of its underlying quasigauge space.

In any case, given any notion of [[space]] with an [[underlying set]] of [[points]] and a [[frame]] of [[open subsets]], we do obtain a topological space that may be said to underly the space.
