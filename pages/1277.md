## Idea

A _comodule_ is to a [[comonoid]] as a [[module]] is to a [[monoid]]. Where a [[module]] is equipped with an [[action]], a comodule is dually equipped with a _coaction_.

## Definition

Given a [[comonoid]] $C$ with comultiplication $\Delta_C: C\to C\otimes C$ and counit $\epsilon:C\to \mathbf{1}$ in a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{M}$, and an [[object]] $M$ in $\mathcal{M}$,
a __left $C$-coaction__ is 

* a [[morphism]] $\rho: M\to C\otimes M$ 

* which is 

  * co[[associative]] i.e. (for $\mathcal{M}$ nonstrict use the canonical isomorphism $C\otimes (C\otimes M)\cong (C\otimes C)\otimes M$ to compare the sides) $(\Delta_C\otimes\mathrm{id}_M)\circ\rho = (\mathrm{id}_C\otimes\rho)\circ\rho: M\to C\otimes C\otimes M$

  * and co[[unital]] i.e. $(\epsilon\otimes \mathrm{id}_M)\circ\rho = \mathrm{id}_M$ (in this formula, $\mathbf{1}\otimes M$ is identified with $M$). 

In some monoidal categories, e.g. of (super)[[vector space]]s, and of [[Hilbert space]]s, one often says (left/right) [[corepresentation]] instead of (left/right) coaction.
