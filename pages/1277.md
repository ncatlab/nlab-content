Given a [[comonoid]] $C$ with comultiplication $\Delta_C: C\to C\otimes C$ and counit $\epsilon:C\to \mathbf{1}$ in a monoidal category $\mathcal{M}$, and an object $M$ in $\mathcal{M}$,
a __left $C$-coaction__ is a morphism $\rho: M\to C\otimes M$ which is coassociative i.e. (for $\mathcal{M}$ nonstrict use the canonical isomorphism $C\otimes (C\otimes M)\cong (C\otimes C)\otimes M$ to compare the sides)
$$(\Delta_C\otimes\mathrm{id}_M)\circ\rho = (\mathrm{id}_C\otimes\rho)\circ\rho: M\to C\otimes C\otimes M$$
and counital i.e. $(\epsilon\otimes \mathrm{id}_M)\circ\rho = \mathrm{id}_M$ (in this formula, $\mathbf{1}\otimes M$ is identified with $M$). 

In some monoidal categories, e.g. of (super)vector spaces, and of Hilbert spaces, one often says (left/right) __corepresentation__ instead of (left/right) coaction.
