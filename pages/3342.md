## Idea

The Haag--Kastler axioms (sometimes also called Araki--Haag--Kastler axioms) try to define in a mathematically precise way the notion of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), by axiomatizing how its local _algebras of observables_ should behave. 

The approch to quantum field theory based on these axioms is often called [[AQFT]]: _algebraic quantum field theory_ .

Although they are called axioms, one should keep in mind that the Haag--Kastler approach to QFT has not reached its final state, so that different versions of the axioms are used by practitioners of the field.

From the [[nPOV]], the Haag-Kastler axioms descibe a coflabby [[copresheaf|presheaf]] of algebras. This kind of structure is similar to the notion of a [[factorization algebra]], which plays a role in other approaches to formalize local algebras of observables.


## Definition

1. Axiom A: 

   To every "allowed" (e.g. bounded open) region $O$ in spacetime there is associated a [[C*-algebra]]; this association fulfils isotony.
The basic assumption of the Haag--Kastler approach is that everything that can be measured in certain regions of spacetime $O$ (like temperature or particle count) is described by an algebra $A(O)$, so that the theory consists of a [[net]] of [[operator algebras]] and a [[state]] $p$ that describes the physical system. There are different approaches to define what regions are "allowed", one common approach is to take all [[bounded space|bounded]] [[open subspace|open]] subsets of [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[spacetime]].

1. Axiom B: locality

   Locality Algebras assigned to regions that are spacelike separated commute. 

1. Axiom C:  Transformation Properties

   The geometric symmetry operations map the algebra of a region onto the algebra of the transformed region.

   In Minkowski spacetime the geometric symmetry group is usually be taken to be the [[Poincaré group]], but note that some authors consider subgroups of the full Poincaré group, like the subgroup of translations (Borchers: "Translation group and particle representations in quantum field theory").

1. Axiom D: Positivity of Energy

   An axiom is needed to ensure that only nonnegative energies occur -- one possibility is the "spectrum condition", which says that the spectrum (to be more precise: the support of the [[spectral measure]]) of the operator associated with a translation is contained in the closed forward light cone, for all translations. 

## Remarks

Unlike the [[Wightman axioms]], the Haag--Kastler axioms do not need the notion of "[[physical field|field]]": the fields in the Wightman axioms are -- from the Haag--Kastler point of view -- only necessary to describe how the algebras of observables are constructed; any way to consistently construct the net of algebras would suffice.

## Example: Causal Nets of Operator Algebras on Minkowski Spacetime
The nLab has a page with a specific choice of axioms and an exposition of some of their consequences here: [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]]

## Generalization of the Haag-Kastler Axioms to Curved Spacetimes
It is possible to generalize the Haag-Kastler approach to general (Lorentzian) spacetimes.

### Idea
From the physical point of view there are two different reasons to consider the Haag-Kastler approach on more general manifolds than the Minkowski spacetime:

* It is expected that such a theory, while not solving the problem to construct a theory of quantum gravity, would still have a wide range of validity.

* From a conceptual viewpoint abandoning the special situation of the Minkowski spacetime could lead to the development of new ideas and tools that turn out to be helpful to understand the concept of a quantum field theorie better.

The first point deserves some elaboration: The curved manifolds under consideration are supposed to be solutions to the field equations of General Relativity, i.e. physically realistic spacetimes, so that gravity is modelled classically by the curvature of spacetime. A quantum field theory on such a spacetime should be able to model the situation of elementary particles that feel the effects of gravity while neglecting the effect that the particles themselves have on spacetime (the notion of "particle" is highly nontrivial and problematic in this setting and is to be understood in a metaphorical sense in the given context). Example: If you let an electron drop from your hand to the ground, that would be a situation that the theory is supposed to describe.
While a full theory of quantum gravity still eludes us, a theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes could be useful as a kind of interpolation. In a certain sense this is already the case, since the [laws of black hole thermodynamics] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_thermodynamics) were first discovered with the help of this setting.
