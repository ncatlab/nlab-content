## Idea
 {#Idea}

The Haag--Kastler axioms (sometimes also called Araki--Haag--Kastler axioms) try to capture in a mathematically precise way the notion of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), by axiomatizing how its [[local nets of observables]] should behave. 

Although they are called axioms, one should keep in mind that the Haag-Kastler approach to QFT has not reached its final state, so that different versions of the axioms are used by practitioners of the field.

### Terminology
 {#Terminology}

The approch to quantum field theory based on these axioms is often called _[[AQFT]]_ : either for **axiomatic quantum field theory** (since it was among the first attempts to put the edifice of QFT on solid [[axiom]]atic grounds) or **algebraic quantum field theory** (since it amplifies the algebras of local [[observable]]s over the spaces of [[state]]s). Neither of these terms is very descriptive. First there is  another, dual, axiomatization which does axiomatize the propagation of [[states]] -- see _[[FQFT]]_ -- which, second, is also "algebraic" in some sense, even though algebras of observables to not appear directly.

Another common term for these axioms is **local quantum field theory** (see the title of the standard textbook ([Haag](#Haag))) since, as becomes clear [below](#Formulation), they are focused on encoding the locality properties of QFT in terms of the algebras of observables. However, also the core aspect of _[[extended topological quantum field theory|extended]]_ [[FQFT]] is all about the notion of locality  of QFT. 

Therefore neither of the traditional terms for QFT as axiomatized by Haag-Kastler is truly descriptive in that it genuinely distinguishes from the other, the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization by [[FQFT]]. What does distinguish the two approaches  may be characterized in traditional terminology of quantum theory as follows ([Schreiber](#Schreiber), [SatiSchreiber](#SatiSchreiber)): 

* [[FQFT]] axiomatizes the _Schrödinger picture_ of QFT, which encodes the propagation of [[state]]s through spacetimes;

* [[AQFT]] axiomatizes the _Heisenberg picture_ of QFT, which encodes the way that [[observable]]s depend on spacetime.


### Motivation
 {#Motivation}

A central difference between the Haag-Kastler axioms and traditionally more widespread formulations of QFT (usually far from being formalized in any way) is the emphasis of the [[algebra of observables]]  of a QFT (Heisenberg picture) and the de-emphasis of the ([[Hilbert space|Hilbert]]) [[spaces of states]] (Schrödinger picture). This emphasis receives motivation from the the fact thatz many technical problems of QFT simply disappear when one is not trying to form its spaces of states, while at the same time no real information abut the theory is lost.

Examples of technical problems that formulation in terms of spaces of states bring with them are the following:

* In [[quantum field theory]] as opposed to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Stone-von Neumann theorem]] fails, making the [[unitary representation]] of the [[Heisenberg group]] on the spaces of states non-unique, hence requiring an explicit choice of representation. There is no generally good theory available for how to make this choice.

* More seriously, [[Haag's theorem]] says that at a crucial step in [[perturbation theory]] where one wants to pass from the representation "free fields" to that of "interacing fields", the two representations are necessarily inequivalent, contrary to what is (silently or explicitly) assumed in much traditional QFT literature (see [EarmanFraser](#EarmanFraser)).

* In the [[renormalization]] or [[perturbation theory]] the formulation in terms of states brings with it _infrared problems_ that are simply absent when formulating renormalization just in terms of observables ([DuetschFredenhagen](#DuetschFredenhagen)).

## Formulation
 {#Formulation}

We formulate the ideas of the core axioms of Haag-Kastler, and their intended physical meaning. For more details see [[local net of observables]].

1. **spacetime locality** 

   Since the _fields_ in [[quantum field theory]] (such as the [[electromagnetic field]]) exhibit and are characterized by
their _local excitations_ (for instance the value of the electric/magnetic [[field strength]] at any point) having effects only locally (the field excitations at two points a finite distance apart do not directly influence each other) the fields over any region of [[spacetime]] form a [[subsystem]] of the fields of any larger region and
in particular of the total system.

   If "[[quantum mechanical system]]" is formalized as "[[C-star algebra]]" (of [[observables]]) then "[[subsystem]]" translates to "sub-$C^*$-algebra". Therefore the above sentence translates into: quantum fields form a [[copresheaf]] of [[C-star algebras]] on [[spacetimes]] whose co-restriction morphisms are [[monomorphism]]s. 

   In [[AQFT]] such is called an **[[local net|isotonic net of algebras]]** .

   There are different approaches to define what kind of spacetime regions the algebras of observables are assigned to, hence different approaches as to what exactly the [[site]] is on which the co-presheaf is defined. A common approach is to take all [[bounded space|bounded]] [[open subspace|open]] subsets of [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[spacetime]]. For more general setups see [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]].

1. **causal locality**

   If two regions of [[spacetime]] are [[spacelike]] separated, then there can be no influence between them whatsoever. Not only do the field excitations in one of the two regions not _directly_ influence those in the other region (as per item 1), but they do not even influence _indirectly_ : no [[waves]] of excitations (for instance [[electromagnetic waves]]: [[light]]) can run from one region to a spacelike separated region. Therefore the two [[subsystems]] constituted by these two regions accordording to the first point are even _[[independent subsystems]]_ .

   The formalization of "two [[independent subsystems]]" in [[quantum mechanics]] is: two subalgebras that _commute_ with each other inside the larger [[C-star algebra]]. (And usually one adds: and such that the algebra they generate in the larger algebra is [[isomorphic]] to their [[tensor product]].)

   Therefore this translates into the axiom: quantum fields on a
spacetime form an isotonic copresheaf of algebras such that the
algebras assigned to any two spacelike separated regions commute with
each other inside the algebra assigned to any larger region containing
these two regions.


1. **spacetime covariance**

   The geometric symmetry operations map the algebra of a region onto the algebra of the transformed region.

   (this is not an extra axiom if one defines the [[site]] of spacetime regions general enough...)

   In Minkowski spacetime the geometric symmetry group is usually be taken to be the [[Poincaré group]], but note that some authors consider subgroups of the full Poincaré group, like the subgroup of translations (Borchers: "Translation group and particle representations in quantum field theory").

1. **positivity of energy**

   An axiom is needed to ensure that only nonnegative energies occur -- one possibility is the "spectrum condition", which says that the spectrum (to be more precise: the support of the [[spectral measure]]) of the operator associated with a translation is contained in the closed forward light cone, for all translations. 

## Properties

### Structural theorems

It is possible to prove both a [[spin-statistics theorem]] and a [[PCT theorem]] in the Haag-Kastler approach. The mathematically precise, model independent statements and their proofs are considered to be a major breakthrough of the theory.


### Relation to Wightman axioms

Unlike the [[Wightman axioms]], the Haag--Kastler axioms do not need the notion of "[[physical field|field]]": the fields in the Wightman axioms are -- from the Haag--Kastler point of view -- only necessary to describe how the algebras of observables are constructed; any way to consistently construct the net of algebras would suffice.
