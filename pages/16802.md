## Idea

Given by a Lie [[action]] of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ on another Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}$, hence a Lie algebra [[homomorphism]] 

$$
  \rho \colon \mathfrak{g}\longrightarrow \mathfrak{der}(\mathfrak{a})
$$ 

to the [[derivations]] on $\mathfrak{a}$, then there is a [[Lie algebra extension]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\mathfrak{a}$ whose underlying vector space is 

$$
  \hat \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \oplus \mathfrak{a}
$$ 

and whose [[Lie bracket]] is given by the formula

$$
  [(x_1,t_1), (x_2,t_2)]
  =
  ( [x_1,x_2], \;([t_1,t_2] + \rho(x_1)(t_2) - \rho(x_2)(t_1)) )
  \,.
$$

This is the _semidirect product_ of $\mathfrak{g}$ with $\mathfrak{a}$.
