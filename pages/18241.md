###### Proposition
**(open/closed continuous injections are embeddings)**

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y,\tau_Y)$
which is

1. an [[injective function]]

1. an [[open map]] or a [[closed map]]

is a [[topological embedding]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $f$ is injective, then the map onto its [[image]] $X \to f(X) \subset Y$ is a [[bijection]]. Moreover, it is still continuous with respect to the [[subspace topology]] on $f(X)$. Now a bijective continuous function is a homeomorphism precisely if it is an [[open map]] or a [[closed map]] (by [this prop.](homeomorphism#HomeoContinuousOpenBijection)). But the image projection of $f$ has this property, respectively, if $f$ does (by [this prop.](open+map#OpenClosedImageProjection)).
