## Idea

[[David Hilbert]] had famously suggested to find a finite set of [[axioms]] to serve as a [[foundation]] for all of [[mathematics]].

The original version of Hilbert's program was overthrown by [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem]]. But suitable variants of it persist, see at _[[proof theory]]_
