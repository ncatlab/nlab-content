A __maximal ideal theorem__ is a theorem stating that every [[proper ideal]] is contained in some [[maximal ideal]].  A maximal ideal theorem is typically equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), or a slightly weaker version such as the [[ultrafilter principle]] (UF).

We say 'a' maximal ideal theorem (MIT) instead of 'the' maximal ideal theorem, since we have not said what the ideals are in.  There are several examples:

*  The MIT for [[rings]] is equivalent to AC.

*  The MIT for [[Heyting algebras]] is equivalent to AC.

*  The MIT for [[Boolean algebras]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The MIT for [[rigs]], which subsumes all of the above, is equivalent to AC.

One typically proves a maximal ideal theorem with [[Zorn's Lemma]], unless one is specifically trying to use something weaker.

Compare the [[prime ideal theorem]].
