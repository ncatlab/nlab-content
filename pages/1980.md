##Motivation##

The functor $Proj$ of a [[graded object|graded]] [[commutative algebra]] is a [[projective variety]]. [[projective scheme|Projective schemes]] are particular cases of [[schemes]], so they have nontrivial covers by open affine subschemes. In the noncommutative case, [[Ore localization]]s (even on one-sided Ore sets) on Ore sets which are multiplicatively generated by finite subsets behave very much like [[Zariski topology|Zariski-open]] subsets. F. van Oystaeyen produced an appropriate notion of a [[cover]] in terms of Ore localizations at two-sided Ore subsets in a graded algebra to define a notion of _schematic algebra_.
