A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __open__ if the [[inclusion function|inclusion map]] $A \hookrightarrow X$ is an [[open map]].

For a point-based notion of space such as a [[topological space]], an open subspace is the same thing as an __open subset__.

(There is a lot more to say, about convergence spaces, locales, smooth spaces, etc, but right now I just want to get the redirects in.)
