A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __open__ if the [[inclusion function|inclusion map]] $A \hookrightarrow X$ is an [[open map]].

For a point-based notion of space such as a [[topological space]], an open subspace is the same thing as an __open subset__.

In [[locale]] theory, every open $U$ in the locale defines an open subspace which is given by the [[nucleus]]
$$ j_{U}\colon V \mapsto U \Rightarrow V .$$
The idea is that this subspace is the part of $X$ which involves only $U$, and we may identify $V$ with $U \Rightarrow V$ when we are looking only at $U$.

(There is a lot more to say, about convergence spaces, smooth spaces, etc.)
