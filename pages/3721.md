## Definition

A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __open__ if the [[inclusion function|inclusion map]] $A \hookrightarrow X$ is an [[open map]].

For a point-based notion of space such as a [[topological space]], an open subspace is the same thing as an __open subset__.

In [[locale]] theory, every open $U$ in the locale defines an open subspace which is given by the __open [[nucleus]]__
$$ j_{U}\colon V \mapsto U \Rightarrow V .$$
The idea is that this subspace is the part of $X$ which involves only $U$, and we may identify $V$ with $U \Rightarrow V$ when we are looking only at $U$.

The __[[topological interior|interior]]__ of any subspace $A$ is the largest open subspace contained in $A$, that is the [[union]] of all open subspaces of $A$.  The interior of $A$ is variously denoted $Int(A)$, $Int_X(A)$, $A^\circ$, $\overset{\circ}A$, etc.

(There is a lot more to say, about [[convergence spaces]], [[smooth spaces]], [[schemes]], etc.)
