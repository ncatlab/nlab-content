Given a $k$-vector bundle $p : E\to M$ of finite rank $n$, its __frame bundle__ (or bundle of frames in $E\to M$) is the bundle $F E\to M$ over the same base whose fiber over $x\in M$ is the set consisting of all vector space bases of $E_x = p^{-1}(x)$. The frame bundle has a natural action of $GL_n(k)$ given by an ordered change of basis which is free and transitive, i. e. the frame bundle is a principal $GL_n(k)$-bundle. 

The __frame bundle of a manifold__ $M$ is the principal bundle $F T M\to M$ (also denoted $F M\to M$) of frames in $T M$.
