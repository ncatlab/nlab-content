## Definitions

Given a $k$-[[vector bundle]] $p\colon E \to M$ of finite [[rank]] $n$, its __frame bundle__ (or bundle of [[frame of a vector space|frames]] in $E \to M$) is the bundle $F E \to M$ over the same base whose [[fiber]] over $x \in M$ is the set of all vector space [[basis|bases]] of $E_x = p^{-1}(x)$. The frame bundle has a natural action of $GL_n(k)$ given by an ordered change of basis which is free and transitive, i. e., the frame bundle is a [[principal bundle|principal]] $GL_n(k)$-bundle. 

The __frame bundle of a [[manifold]]__ $M$ is the [[principal bundle]] $F T M \to M$ (also denoted $F M \to M$) of frames in the [[tangent bundle]] $T M$.
