# Idea #

A [[topological space]] is _sequential_ if (in a certain sense) you can do topology in it using only [[sequences]] instead of more general [[nets]].

Sequential spaces are a kind of [[nice topological space]].


# Definition #

A __sequential topological space__ is a [[topological space]] $X$ such that a subset $A$ of $X$ is closed iff it contains all the limit points of all [[sequences]] whose members are in $A$---or equivalently, such that $A$ is open iff any sequence converging to a point of $A$ must eventually be in $A$.


# Examples #

* Every [[Frechet-Uryson space]] is a sequential space.

* Every topological space satisfying the first countability axiom is Frechet–Uryson, hence a sequential space.  In particular, this includes any [[metric space|metrizable]] space.

* Every [[quotient object|quotient]] of a sequential space is sequential.   In particular, every [[CW complex]] is also a sequential space.  Conversely, every sequential space is a quotient of a metrizable space.


# Properties

* The category of sequential spaces is a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the category of all topological spaces.

* The category of sequential spaces is a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of [[subsequential spaces]], much as $Top$ itself is a reflective subcategory of the category of all [[pseudotopological spaces]].
