## Idea

In the context of [[algebraic topology]], _conditional convergence_ referes to a more general kind of convergence of [[spectral sequences]] than actual convergence.

Notably an $E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]  is in general only conditionally convergent (to the $E$-nilpotent completion), unless finitenss conditions are imposed
