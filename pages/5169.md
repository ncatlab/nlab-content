
There are different meanings of _operator_:

* A [[linear operator]], or more generally an element of an [[operator algebra]].

* In [[higher type theory]], an operator is a [[function]] from a [[set]] of functions to itself:
  $$ O\colon Y^X \to Y^X , \quad O \in (Y^X)^{Y^X} = Y^{X \times Y^X} .$$

* Probably more ...

The connection between these two is that, if $H$ is a [[vector space]] of functions ($H \subseteq Y^X$), then a linear operator (in the first) is a special case of a ([[partial function|partially defined]]) operator (in the second sense).
