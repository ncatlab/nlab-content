
There are different meanings of _operator_:

* In [[functional analysis]], an operator is a [[linear operator]], or more generally (by abstraction) an element of any [[operator algebra]].

* In [[higher type theory]], an operator is a [[function]] from a [[function set]] to itself:
  $$ O\colon Y^X \to Y^X , \quad O \in (Y^X)^{Y^X} = Y^{X \times Y^X} .$$

* More?

The connection between these two may be found in the origins of the term 'functional analysis'; if $H$ is a [[vector space]] whose elements are functions ($H \subseteq Y^X$, more particularly $H \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$), then a linear operator on $H$ (an operator in the first sense) is a [[partial function|partially defined]] operator in the second sense.
