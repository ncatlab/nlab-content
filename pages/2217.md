
We had this error message up briefly in 2009 when we changed servers.  It was [cited in _New Scientist_](http://zenmischief.blogspot.com/2010/12/defining-normal.html), so now we have to keep it forever, so you can all verify for yourselves what geeks we are (or 
were in 2009).

**2011-08-02** This error message is being reinstated briefly while the server on which the nLab and Azimuth Project run is being upgraded.

The _n_-Lab is currently experiencing some difficulties due to local fluctuations in reality.
The [[lab elf|Lab Elves]] are working hard to patch reality.
In the meantime, edits on the _n_-Lab have been temporarily disabled since the fundamentals of mathematics may vary during these spasmodic variations.
Normal service will be restored once we are sure what "normal" is.
