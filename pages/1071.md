An [[additive category|additive functor]] $F$ from a [[triangulated category]] $A$ (with translation denoted $X\mapsto X[1]$) to an [[abelian category]] $C$ is a **cohomological functor** if for any distinguished triangle 
$$
X\stackrel{f}\to Y\stackrel{g}\to Z\stackrel{h}\to X[1],
$$
in $A$, $F X\stackrel{F f}\to F Y\stackrel{F g}\to F Z$ is an [[exact sequence]] in $C$.
