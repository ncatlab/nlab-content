Due to [[Paul Taylor]], a reaxiomatisation of the notions of space and map in general topology in terms of the [[lambda calculus|λ-calculus]] of computable continuous functions and predicates that is both constructive and computable. The topology on a space is treated not as a lattice, but as an [[exponential object]] of the same category as the original space, with an associated λ-calculus. Every expression in the λ-calculus denotes both a continuous function and a program. ASD does not use the [[Set|category of sets]], but the full subcategory of overt discrete objects plays this role (an overt object is the dual to a compact object), forming an [[arithmetic universe]] (pretopos with lists) with general recursion.
