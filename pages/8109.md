## Idea


By the construction of [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] from [[formal groups]] (via the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]]), the [[height of a formal group|height filtration]] of formal groups induces a "[[chromatic filtration|chromatic]]" [[filtration]] on [[complex oriented cohomology theories]]. 
_Chromatic homotopy theory_ is the study of [[stable homotopy theory]] and specifically of [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] by means of and along this [[chromatic filtration]].

More abstractly, this filtering is induced by the [[prime spectrum of a symmetric monoidal stable (∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] for [[p-localization|p-local]] [[finite spectra]], which is labeled by the [[Morava K-theories]].

More in detail, for each [[prime]] $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and for each  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a [[Bousfield localization of spectra]]

$$
  L_n \coloneqq L_{K(0)\vee \cdots \vee K(n)}
  \,,
$$

where $K(n)$ is the $n$th [[Morava K-theory]] (for the given [[prime]] $p$). These arrange into the [[chromatic tower]] which for each spectrum $X$ is of the form

$$  
  X \to \cdots \to L_n X \to L_{n-1} X \to \cdots \to L_0 X
  \,.
$$

The [[chromatic convergence theorem]] states mild conditions under which the [[homotopy limit]] over this tower is the $p$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] 

$$
  X \to X_{(p)}
$$

of $X$. 

Since moreover $L_n X$ is the [[homotopy fiber product]] (see at _[[smash product theorem]]_ and see [this remark](fracture+theorem#ExampleOfChromaticFracturing) at _[[fracture square]]_ )

$$
  L_n X \simeq L_{K(n)}X \underset{L_{n-1}L_{K(n)}X}{\times} L_{n-1}X
$$

it follows that in principle one may study a spectrum $X$ by understanding all its "chromatic pieces" $L_{K(n)} X$.
