**Krzysztof Gawędzki** is a mathematical physicist. Much of his works is related to [[conformal field theory]], especially geometric aspects of [[WZNW models]]. More recently he studies turbulence. He has helped identidy the [[Kalb-Ramond field]]/[[B-field]] with a [[cocycle]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]  (in [[Deligne cohomology]]/a [[bundle gerbe]] with connection).
