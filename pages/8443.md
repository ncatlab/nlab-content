## Idea

A _quotient group_ is a [[quotient object]] in the [[category]] [[Grp]] of [[groups]]. 

## Definition


For $G$ a [[group]] and $H \hookrightarrow G$ a [[normal subgroup]], the [[quotient group]] $G/H$ is the [[coset]] equipped with the group structure induced form $G$.

## Examples

* For $A \hookrightarrow B$ a morphism between [[abelian groups]] the quotient $B/A$ is equivalently the [[cokernel]] of the inclusion.
