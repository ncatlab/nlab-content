## Idea


The term "cohomological field theory" is mostly used for the "Witten style" [[topological quantum field theories]] which arise from a [[topological twist]] of a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theory]], notable example being the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] [[topological string]].

Mathematically these topological field theories came to be known as _[[TCFT|TCFTs]]_. With the proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] these were understood to be the "non-compact" 2-dimensional [[extended TQFTs]] with codomain an [[(infinity,1)-category of chain complexes]], where "non-compact" refers to all [[cobordisms]] being required to have non-empty outgoing [[boundary]].

For more on all this see at _[[TCFT]]_ and at _[[2d TQFT]]_.
