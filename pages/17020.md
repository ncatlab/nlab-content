## Idea

An [[object]] in the [[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]].

Hene a [[spectrum]] compatibly equipped wih the structure of a $G$-[[equivariant spectrum]] as $G$ ranges over a suitable given class of [[groups]].

## Examples

* The global [[equivariant sphere spectrum]] for all the [[cyclic groups]] over the [[circle group]] is canonically a [[cyclotomic spectrum]] and as such is the [[tensor unit]] in the [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] of [[cyclotomic spectra]] (see there).
