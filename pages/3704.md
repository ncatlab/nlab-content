## Idea

Central aspects of _finite_ [[quantum mechanics]] (with finite-dimensional [[space of states|state space]], notably for [[tensor products]] of [[qbit]] states) and [[quantum computation]] follow formally from the formal properties of the [[category]] [[Hilb|FinHilb]] of finite-dimensional [[Hilbert spaces]]. These properties are axomatized by saying that [[Hilb]] is an example of a _[[†-compact category]]_.

Conversely, much of finite quantum mechanics and quantum computation can be formulated in _any_ †-compact category, and general reasoning about †-compact categories themselves yields results about quantum mechanics and quantum computation.

An transparent [[string diagram]] calculus in †-compact categories as exposed in ([Coecke, Kindergarten qunatum mechanics](#CoeckeKindergarten)) provides an intuitive and powerful tool for reasoning in $\dagger$-compact categories.


## Quantum mechanical concepts in $\dagger$-compact categories

Let $(C,\otimes,I, \dagger)$ be a [[†-compact category]].

We list various concepts in quantum mechanics and their corresponding incarnation in terms of structures in $C$.

### Classical measurement outcomes

An [[observable]] in quantum mechanics formulated on a [[Hilbert space]] is modeled by a [[self-adjoint operator]], and the classical measurement outcomes of this operator provide, at least under some assumptions, an [[orthogonal basis]] on the [[Hilbert space]].

That, more abstractly, the notion of orthogonal basis of an object can be phrased intrinsically inside any suitable $\dagger$-compact category is the point made in ([CoeckePavlovicVicary](#CoeckePavlovicVicary))


### Complex phases

The underlying "algebra of quantum amplitudes" of the corresponding quantum mechanical system is the [[endomorphism]] [[monoid]] of the tensor unit

$$
  \mathbb{C}_C = End_C(I)
  \,.
$$


In ([Vicary](#Vicary)) it is shown that in $\dagger$-compact categories with all finite limits over certain "tree-like" diagrams compatible with the $\dagger$-structure, this $\mathbb{C}_C$ has the properties that

* it is a [[field]] of characteristic 0 with involution $\dagger$;

* the subfield $\mathbb{R}_C$ fixed under $\dagger$ is [[order]]able.

If furthermore every bounded sequence of measurements in $C$ with values in $\mathbb{R}_C$ has a least upper bound, then it follows that this field coincides with the [[complex number]]s 

$$
  \mathbb{C}_C = \mathbb{C}
$$

and moreover

$$
  \mathbb{R}_C = \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$



### Completely positive maps {#ComplPosMaps}

The behaviour of [[quantum channel]]s and _completely positive maps_ has an elegant categorical description in terms of $\dagger$-compact categories. See ([Selinger](#SelingerPositive) and [Coecke](#CoeckePositive)).
