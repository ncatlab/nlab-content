A [[symmetry]] is invariance under a [[group]] [[action]].

A **supersymmetry** is invariance under a [[supergroup]] action.

Supersymmetry is particularly an issue in theoretical [[physics]], which knows many models that suggest thath the familiar symmetry of various [[action functional]]s should be enhanced to a supersymmetry in order to more properly describe fundamental physics.

The theory of [[supergravity]] is, as a [[classical field theory]], an [[action functional]] on functions on a [[supermanifold]] $X$ which is invariant under the super-diffeomorphism group of $X$.
