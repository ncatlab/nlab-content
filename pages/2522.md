## Idea


Where generally a [[symmetry]] is an invariance under a [[group]] [[action]] (after all the mathematical term "[[group]]" is a contraction of _group of symmetries_), or, [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimally]], an invariance under a [[Lie algebra]] action,  in the general sense of the word, a **supersymmetry** is invariance under a [[supergroup]] action or a [[super Lie algebra]] action. 

By [[Deligne's theorem on tensor categories]] it is precisely the context of supersymmetry in which [[tensor categories]] over the [[complex numbers]] exhibit full [[Tannaka duality]].

In the stricter sense of the word as it originates in theoretical fundamental [[physics]], _supersymmetry_ refers specifically to supergeometric extensions of the [[isometry group]] (or its Lie algebra)  of the local model of [[spacetime]]. For [[Minkowski spacetime]] this is the [[Poincaré group]] with its [[Poincaré Lie algebra]] and their super-extensions are accordingly known as the [[super Poincaré group]]  and [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]]. In physics the latter are often referred to simply as  **the supersymmetry algebra**. An odd element in this [[super Lie algebra]] is called a **supersymmetry generator** and its [[Hamiltonian]] is called a _[[supercharge]]_. More generally, if spacetime geometry is taken to be [[conformal geometry]] or [[de Sitter spacetime]]/[[anti-de Sitter spacetime]], then one considers supergeometric extensions of the [[conformal group]], [[de Sitter group]] and [[anti de Sitter group]], respectively, and then these are the relevant "supersymmetries".

With the focus on spacetime symmetry groups implicitly understood, this implies that supersymmetry is the group theory relevant for [[super Cartan geometry]] locally modeled on [[super Minkowski spacetime]] or [[super anti de Sitter spacetime]], etc. In terms of physics and in view of the [[first order formulation of gravity]], this means that "locally gauged" supersymmetry is the super-geometric generalization from [[Einstein gravity]] to [[supergravity]] or, respectively, from [[conformal field theory]] to [[superconformal field theory]], etc.







### Global supersymmetry and superparticles

By [[Wigner-Weyl theory]] we have in ordinary [[quantum field theory]] that [[unitary representations of the Poincaré group]] correspond to the [[particle]]s in the theory. For a _globally_ supersymmetric quantum field theory the [[Poincaré group]] here is replaced by the [[super Poincaré group]] and accordingly particles are now [[irreducible representation]]s of this group: the irreducible [[unitary representations of the super Poincaré group]]. The new -- odd graded -- pieces of these representations -- called **[[supermultiplets]]** -- appearing this way  are called the **[[superpartners]]** of the original _bosonic_ particles.

### Local supersymmetry: supergravity

To be distinguished from this _global supersymmetry_ is _local supersymmetry_ (see at _[[gauge group]]_ and at _[[Cartan connection]]_):  given a [[gauge theory]] whose fields are [[connection on a bundle|connections]] with values in the [[Poincaré Lie algebra]] -- the theory of [[gravity]] in its [[first order formulation of gravity|first order formulation]] -- a supersymmetric extension is similarly a [[gauge theory]] with fields being connections in the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] -- a theory of [[supergravity]]. A [[gauge transformation]] in such a theory is called a **local supersymmetry transformation**.

### The relation between local and global supersymmetry

The distinction between local and global supersymmetry is important when considering [[supergravity]] in [[perturbation theory]] where all fields are expanded around a fixed [[spacetime]] [[geometry]] and fixed [[background gauge fields]] that form a solution of the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]].

While the theory of supergravity as such has, by definition, local supersymmetry, a solution to it may but need not have any _global supersymmetry_ left. In fact, generically it will not.

To see this, it is maybe helpful to compare with the analogous statement in non-supersymmetric [[QFT]]:

the theory of [[gravity]] is _locally_ Poincaré-symmetric: in [[first order formulation of gravity|first order formulation]] it is a [[Poincaré group]] [[gauge theory]]. Nevertheless, any of its solutions -- which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] -- may, but need not, have any Poincaré-symmetry. It does have such a _global_ symmetry for every [[Killing vector]] on the [[spacetime]]. Such may or may not exist. Generically it does not exist.

The analog of these Killing vectors in [[supergravity]] are [[Killing spinor]]s: [[covariantly constant spinor]]s ([[section]]s of a 
[[spinor bundle]] annihilated by the [[spin connection]]'s [[covariant derivative]]).
For every such, the background has one global supersymmetry transformation. These may or may not exist. Generically they do not.

The most famous example of this is that of [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]]: a  standard assumption on [[phenomenological|phenomenology]] [[model building]] that used to be very popular around the turn of the millenium (but is maybe experimentally ruled out at the time of this writing) is that 

1. the [[spacetime]] we see around us locally looks like a product $M^4 \times Y^6$ of 4-dimensional [[Minkowski space]] times a tiny closed [[Riemannian manifold]] $Y^6$ (so tiny that it is not directly observable but manifests itself only by way of its lowest excitation modes that look like different [[particle]] species on the remaining $M^4$ -- see [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]] );

1. such that on this product space a single covariant constant spinor exists, such that the resulting effective theory on $M^4$ has a single global supersymmetry ("$N=1$ supersymmetry").

One finds that this condition is solved precisely by $Y^6$ being a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]. For more on this see the corresponding section at [[heterotic string theory]].

But notice that nothing in the theory of 10-dimensional [[supergravity]] _demands_ that its solutions have a global supersymmetry left (generically they will not) nor that they factor locally as $M^4 \times Y^6$. All this is an _ansatz_ a _phenomenological model_ . It only says that _if_ we make this ansatz, then $Y^6$ needs to be a Calabi-Yau space. In fact, it turns out to be nontrivial to check that with all the other fields taken into account, such a factor ansatz is indeed consistent. (This problem of "moduli stabilization" is discussed a little bit at [[landscape of string theory vacua]].)

Latest experimental results strongly suggest that this model of global $(N = 1)$-supersymmetry at observable energies is not a description of our phenomenological reality. Still, it could well be that the underlying theory of the world is nevertheless not plain [[general relativity]] but [[supergravity]].

### Observed supersymmetry: on the worldline

To appreciate this point it is worthwhile to notice that supersymmetric quantum field theory in fact _has_ been observed in nature, already since a century ago. To see this, one needs to notice how [[fundamental particle]]s are described by [[sigma model]] quantum field theories (see there) on their [[worldvolume]]:

the $\sigma$-model action functional for the standard Dirac [[spinor]] particle -- such as [[electron]]s and [[quarks]], the particles that all the matter in the world is made of -- just happens to have [[worldline supersymmetry]]. This is discussed at _[[spinning particle]]_ . Notice that this is true for electrons and quarks in the non-supersymmetric [[standard model of particle physics]]: the [[target space]] theory is completely void of (global) supersymmetry, and still the [[worldvolume]] theory of any [[fermion]] is automatically supersymmetric.


### Conjectured supersymmetry: on spacetime and on the worldsheet
 {#SupersymmetryOnSpacetimeAndWorldsheet}

A similar statement as for the [[spinning particle]] and its automatic local [[worldline supersymmetry]] indeed also holds for the _[[spinning string]]_ : while it is a conjecture of [[string theory]] which has not been experimentally verified that fundamentally the [[sigma-model]] theories that describe the physics around us is defined not on 1-dimensional but on 2-dimensional [[worldvolume]]s, it remains a noteworthy fact that the standard [[action functional]] for the [[string]] [[sigma model]] with [[fermion]]s _on the [[worldsheet]]_ just happens to be locally supersymmetric. It is hard to avoid this! And indeed, this was how the abstract notion of supersymmetry in [[quantum field theory]] was realized in the west first: people wrote down action functionals for _[[spinning string]]s_ and noticed that these happened to have an interesting graded symmetry (see there for references).

So while it is an open conjecture of [[string theory]] that the particle [[worldline]]s that are experimentally observed are secretly really [[worldsheet]]s, assuming that this conjecture holds for [[fermion]]s automatically implies local worldsheet supersymmetry and the [[superstring]].

Now, the effective [[spacetime]] [[target space]] theories arising from [[second quantization]] of the [[superstring]] are fairly well understood: these are higher dimensional [[supergravity]] theories coupled to the various [[background gauge field|higher gauge fields]] that are also in the spectrum of the string (the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[RR-field]]s, notably). They are called _[[type II supergravity]]_ , [[heterotic supergravity]], etc. All of these are obtained by compactifications of [[11-dimensional supergravity]].

This means that the assumption of [[spinning string]] [[sigma-models]] automatically implies that the [[spacetime]] [[QFT]] that we observe also has _local_ supersymmetry.

Over the decades it has often been suggested that therefore the assumption of [[spinning string]]s "suggests" or "favours" the observation of superpartner particles in accelerators. However, this is not so:

in these constructions the [[particle]] species seen in accelerators are [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-modes]] and/or brane-brane open string modes of the compactified locally supersymmetric theory. This means that they are determined by the compactification geometry. Only if that has a global [[Killing spinor]] is the effective 4-dimensional theory globally supersymmetric and exhibits superpartners. As was mentioned above, for spacetimes of the form $M^4 \times Y^6$ this is the case precisely if $Y^6$ is a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]].

But this is far from being the generic situation. This is clear qualitatively (a generic solution to the super-[[Einstein equations]] will not have a [[Killing spinor]]). A more sophisticated and quantitative argument to the same effect is given, for instance, in ([DLSW08](#DLSW)).





### In fundamental physics

Supersymmetric extensions of [[quantum field theories]] have been felt to be compelling in fundamental physics for _formal reasons_ : the simple step from [[Lie algebra]]s to [[super Lie algebra]]s

* make a pure theory of [[gravity]] seamlessly incorporate [[fermion]]s and [[gauge field]]s;

* leads to better [[renormalization]] properties (indeed the speculation that $N=8, D=4$ [[supergravity]] is fully renormalizable -- in stark contrast to ordinary [[gravity]] has more recently been checked up to high loop orders);

* produces a wealth of interesting mathematical structures. For instance 

  * [[Morse theory]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] can naturally be understood in terms of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] for [[superparticle]]s propagating on that manifold;

  * the interpretation of [[quantum field theories]] in terms of [[generalized cohomology]] theories only works for supersymmetric theories (see [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory
]] and [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory]])

  * "topological twists" of supersymmetric field theories are a major source of examples of [[TQFT]]s, for instance the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] [[TCFT]] arise from such twists of 2-dimensional [[supergravity]] and there are deep connections between the [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] and topologically twisted [[super Yang-Mills theory]].

Moreover, since various observables in supersymmetric QFTs are easier to compute than in non-supersymmetric theories, supersymmetric quantum field theory is being used to _approximate_ certain aspects of other QFTs. For instance certain correlators in ordinary [[Yang-Mills theory]] coupled to [[spinors in Yang-Mills theory]] can be computed using an auxioary [[super Yang-Mills theory]].

Therefore, if nothing else, supersymmetric quantum field theories constitute a part of the whole space of quantum field theories which is useful for understanding general properties of that space. What is however still missing is any experimental evidence that the world is fundamentally described by a supersymmetric quantum field theory.

+-- {: .proof #ProofOfClassificationOfSuperconformal}
###### Proof (sketch)

By realizing the conformal real Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{R}^{d,2})$ as a real section of the complexified $\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{C}^{d+2})$ one is reduced to finding those (finite dimensional) simple super Lie algebras over the complex numbers whose even-graded part extends $\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{C}^{d+2})$ and such that the implied [[representation]] of that on the odd-graded part contains the [[spin representation]].

The complex finite dimensional simple super Lie algebras have been classified, see at _[super Lie algebra -- Classification](super+Lie+algebra#Classification)_. By the tables shown there

| $\mathfrak{g}$ |  $\mathfrak{g}_{even}$  |  $\mathfrak{g}_{even}$ rep on $\mathfrak{g}_{odd}$ |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| $B(m,n)$  | $B_m \oplus C_n$  | vector $\otimes$ vector |
| $D(m,n)$  | $D_m \oplus C_n$  | vector $\otimes$ vector |
| $D(2,1,\alpha)$ |  $A_1 \oplus A_1 \oplus A_1$ | vector $\otimes$ vector $\otimes$ vector |
| $F(4)$ | $B_3\otimes A_1$ | spinor $\otimes$ vector |
| $G(3)$ | $G_2\oplus A_1$ | spinor $\otimes$ vector |
| $Q(n)$ | $A_n$ | adjoint |

| $\mathfrak{g}$ |  $\mathfrak{g}_{even}$  |  $\mathfrak{g}_{even}$ rep on $\mathfrak{g}_{{-1}}$ |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| $A(m,n)$ |  $A_m \oplus A_n \oplus C$ | vector $\otimes$ vector $\otimes$ $\mathbb{C}$ |
| $A(m,m)$ | $A_m \oplus A_n$ | vector $\otimes$ vector |
| $C(n)$ | $\mathbb{C}_{-1} \oplus \mathbb{C}$ | vector $\otimes$ $\mathbb{C}$ | 


the only manifest spinor representation of $\mathfrak{so}(2k+1) = B_k$ or of $\mathfrak{so}(2k) = D_k$ appears in the exceptional super Lie algebra $F(4)$, which contains $B_3 = \mathfrak{so}(7)$ in its even parts acting spinorially on its odd part. This hence gives a superconformal super Lie algebra in dimension $7-2 = 5$, as shown in the proposition.

But other spinor representations may still disguise as vector representations of other Lie algebras under one of the [exceptional isomorphisms](spin%20group#ExceptionalIsomorphisms). These exist only in low dimensions, and hence to conclude the proof it is sufficient to just list all candidates.

First there is the exceptional isomorphism

$$
  \mathfrak{so}(5) \simeq \mathfrak{sp}(2) = C_2
$$

with the spinor representation of $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ being the vector representation of $\mathfrak{sp}(2) = C_2$. This we find in the above tables as a summand in the even-graded subalgebra of $B(m,2)$ and of $D(m,2)$. Hence these are superconformal super Lie algebras in dimension $5-2 = 3$, as shown in the statement.

The other exceptional isomorphism of relevance is

$$
  \mathfrak{so}(6)\simeq \mathfrak{su}(4) = A_3
$$

with the spinor representation of $\mathfrak{so}(6)$ being the vector representation of $\mathfrak{su}(4) = A_3$. By the above tables this appears as a summand in the even-graded subalgebra of the super Lie algebra $A(3,k)$, and so this is the superconformal algebra in dimension $6-2 = 4$.

Finally by [[triality]] the vector representation of $\mathfrak{so}(8) = D_4$ is isomorphic to its spinor representation. By the above tables this means that $D(4,k)$ is a superconformal algebra in dimension $8-2 = 6$. For details on this see ([Shnider 88, last paragraphs](#Shnider88))

###### Remark

Further constraints follow from requiring unitary representations ([Minwalla 98, section 4.3](#Minwalla98)). This restricts for instance the 6d superconformal algebra to $D(4,1) = \mathfrak{osp}(8|2)$ and $D(4,1) = \mathfrak{osp}(8,4)$, the latter being (over the reals as $\mathfrak{so}(8^\ast|4) = \mathfrak{osp}(6,2|4)$) the symmetry algebra of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of the [[M5-brane]].

### Extensions

In special dimensions supersymmetry super Lie algebras have [polyvector extensions](super%20Poincare%20Lie%20algebra#PolyvectorExtensions) by [[brane]] [[charges]], called for instance the _[[type II supersymmetry algebra]]_ for the case of [[type II supergravity]] or the _[[M-theory supersymmetry algebra]]_ for the case of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]. These in turn are the truncations of [[super L-infinity algebra]] extensions, related to the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]], [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]] etc. See also at _[[extended supersymmetry]]_ and _[[extended super Minkowski spacetime]]_.

### History

The notion of Poincaré supersymmetry was found in parallel by two groups in the 1970s (separated and isolated at that time by "Cold War" nuisances):

Neveu, [[Pierre Ramond]] and [[John Schwarz]] wrote down in 1971 the system called the [[spinning string]] -- a 2-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] with [[fermion]]s and notice that it just so happens to have an extra graded extension of 2-dimensional Poincaré symmetry.

Around the same time Golfand and Likhtman in Russia wrote down the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] in four dimensions. This then motivated [[Julius Wess]] and Zumino to study supersymmetric QFTs in four dimensions. (see the account by ([Schwarz](#Schwarz)))
