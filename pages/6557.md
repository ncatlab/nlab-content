## Definition

_$CommAlg$_ or _$CAlg$_denotes a [[category]] of commutative [[associative algebra]]s. 

Usually this is understood implicitly as algebras over some [[ground field]] $k$. In this case 

$$
  CommAlg \simeq k/CRing
$$

is the [[slice category]] of [[CRing]] -- the category of commutative [[ring]]s -- under $k$.

## Properties

* Via [[measure coalgebras]] $CommAlg$ is naturally [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category [[Coalg]] of [[cocommutative coalgebra]]s.
