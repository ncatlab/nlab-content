  _The world in eleven dimensions: Supgergravity, Supermembranes and $M$-theory_

  IoP 1999

  ([publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/The-World-in-Eleven-Dimensions-Supergravity-supermembranes-and-M-theory/Duff/9780750306720))

that collects and comments key articles in the (pre-)history of [[M-theory]] ([[M-branes]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]]) in the 1990s.

On whether "M" is really for "[[membrane]]" after all:

> In other words, perhaps $D = 11$ supergravity together with [[M-brane|its BPS configurations]]: plane wave, membrane, fivebrane, KK monopole and the $D = 11$ embedding of the Type II eightbraneare are all there is to $M$-theory and that we need look no further for new degrees of freedom. (p. 329)

Concluding with:

> future historians may judge the period 1984-95 as a time when theorists were like boys playing by the sea shore, and diverting themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of perturbative ten-dimensiorial superstrings while the great ocean of non-perturbative eleven-dimensional M-theory lay all undiscovered before them. (p.330)
