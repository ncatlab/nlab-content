## Idea

In [[chemistry]], the _periodic table_ is an arrangement of the chemical elements, originally due to the nineteenth century Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev, and now understood as displaying the common behaviors of families of elements according to the pattern of occupation of the outer electron shell.

An explanation of the order of the elements may be given in terms of the [[quantum physics]] of [[atom (physics)|atoms]] ([[quantum chemistry]]); for a lucid presentation by [[Richard Feynman]], see ([Feynman 63](#Feynman63)).
