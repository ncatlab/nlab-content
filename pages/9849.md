**About the book** (from the cover)

> [[homotopy type theory|Homotopy type theory]] is a new branch of [[mathematics]] that combines aspects of several different fields in a surprising way. It is based on a recently discovered connection between [[homotopy theory]] and [[type theory]]. It touches on topics as seemingly distant as the [[homotopy groups of spheres]], the [[algorithms]] for [[type checking]], and the definition of [[weak ∞-groupoids]]. Homotopy type theory offers a new "[[univalence|univalent]]" [[foundation of mathematics]], in which a central role is played by [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]]’s [[univalence axiom]] and [[higher inductive types]]. The present book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of [[univalent foundations]], and a collection of examples of this new style of [[reasoning]] — but without requiring the reader to know or learn any [[formal logic]], or to use any [[computer proof assistant]]. We believe that [[univalent foundations]] will eventually become a viable alternative to [[set theory]] as the “implicit foundation” for the unformalized mathematics done by most mathematicians.
