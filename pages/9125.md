## Idea

In fundamental [[physics]] the basic entities that are being described are called _fields_, as they appear in the terms _[[classical field theory]]_ and _[[quantum field theory]]_.

### General

The basic example that probably gives the whole concept its name is the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]] in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[electromagnetism]]: if we fix a [[coordinate chart]] of [[spacetime]], then the [[electromagnetic field]] splits into the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]] which are both modeled by a _[[vector field]]_, traditionally denoted $\vec E$ and $\vec B$, respectively, on this coordinate chart. The value $\vec E(x)$ of the vector field at a given point of spacetime is a [[vector]] that expresses the magnitude and direction of the electric [[force]] that is exerted on an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] [[particle]] at $x$. 

In fact more fundamentally, if we do not specify a [[coordinate chart]], then the [[electromagnetic field]] is not in fact represented by two vector fields. Rather, its [[field strength]] is represented by a [[differential 2-form]], hence a [[tensor field]] of rank $(0,2)$, but the the whole field as such is not a tensor field, but is a [[cocycle]] of degree-2 in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]: a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle bundle with connection]].

Or for instance the field of [[gravity]] if modeled as a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] is a [[tensor field]] of rank $(2,0)$ -- but subject to the constraint that this be pointwise non-degenerate. More fundamentally the field of gravity is instead a [[vielbein field]].

Similar statements hold for all [[forces]] of nature, such as the force of [[gravity]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] and [[strong nuclear force]]: a configuration of these is mathematically modeled by [[connection on a bundle|connections]]. Their [[field strengths]] are rank $(0,2)$-tensor fields.

The [[electromagnetic field]] and the field of [[gravity]] are the physical fields that historically gave rise to what is now called _[[classical field theory]]_. But it turns out that fundamentally, in [[quantum physics]], also all [[matter]] in physics is constituted by fields in a similar sense. Specifically, where [[force]] fields in physics are usually [[connection on a bundle|connections on a bundle]], matter fields are [[sections]] of [[associated bundles]]. 

Field theory was originally discovered as a [[theory (physics)|theory]] of fields on _[[spacetime]]_. But also the [[physical system]] consisting of a single [[particle]] propagating in a _fixed_ [[spacetime]] $X$ is described by a field theory. In this case the field is not defined on spacetime, but on the abstract _[[worldline]]_ of the particle, say the _[[real line]]_ $\mathbb{R}$. A consifiguration of the system, namely a [[trajectory]] of the particle, is then a [[smooth function]] $\phi \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}\to X$. This function may be regarded as a _field_ on the [[worldline]] and in then called a _[[sigma-model]]_ field. The [[quantum mechanics]] of a single particle may be equivalently thought of as a [[quantum field theory]] on the 1-dimensional [[worldline]] of the particle.

This perspective generalizes. Next one can consider fields on 2-dimensional [[surfaces]] $\Sigma_2$ which again are given by maps into some [[spacetime]] $X$. The corresponding 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] is then said to describe not a particle but a _[[string]]_ propagating in spacetime, defined on the _[[worldsheet]]_ $\Sigma_2$, replacing the [[worldline]] of the particle. For $\Sigma$ of dimension 3 one accordingly speaks of the _[[worldvolume]]_ of a [[membrane]] and then for $\Sigma$ of general dimension here one speaks of the _[[worldvolume]]_ of a _[[brane]]_. 

But there is no fundamental distinction between physical fields on spaces that are interpreted as [[spacetimes]] and those that are interpreted as [[worldvolumes]] of objects propagating _in_ a fixed spacetime. In general these notions mix. For instance the full description of [[relativistic particles]] and [[relativistic strings]] involves a field that is really a field of [[gravity]] on the [[worldvolume]]. Conversely, [[theory (physics)|theories]] on [[spacetimes]] that arise by [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of higher dimensional theories typically have "[[scalar field|scalar moduli fields]]" that used to be components of the field of [[gravity]] in higher dimensions but now after compactifications become maps into some auxiliary [[target space]], hence again _[[sigma-model]]_ fields.





### The traditional idea of field bundles and its problems
 {#IdeaOfFieldBundlesAndItsProblems}

A traditional approach to formalizing the notion of _physical field_ is to declare that the specification of a [[theory (physics)|theory in physics]]/[[physical system]] comes with a [[fiber bundle]] $E \to X$ over the [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$ (or better: naturally over all spacetimes, see at _[Locality](#IdeaLocality)_ below) called the ***[[field bundle]]*** and that a field configuration of the system is a [[section]] of this field bundle. This is for instance the basis for the theory of the [[variational bicomplex]], hence of [[BV-BRST formalism]] for expressing [[covariant phase spaces]], for standard [[multisymplectic geometry]], etc.

While this goes in the right direction, it cannot be quite the final answer, as it misses crucial properties that are demanded of a general notion of field. We now discuss these problems:

1. [Large gauge transformations](#IdeaLargeGaugeTransformations)

1. [Locality](#IdeaLocality)

1. [Spin structures and other G-structures](#IdeaSpinStructures)

1. [Background fields](#BackgroundFields)

1. [Higher gauge fields](#HigherGaugeFields)

In the course of discussing the problems we also motivate and indicate their solution by a more natural notion of field moduli in [[higher geometry]]. This is then discussed in full detail in the _[Definition](#Definition)_-section below.

#### Large gauge transformations 
 {#IdeaLargeGaugeTransformations}

In [[gauge theory]] specifically but in [[physics]] generally, physical fields come equipped with a notion of which fields configurations, while nominally different, are [[equivalence|equivalent]], called _[[gauge equivalence|gauge equivalent]]_ and it is crucial to retain the information of gauge equivalences and not pass to [[equivalence classes]] of gauge equivalent fields. This means that generically for any [[physical theory]], even if all field configurations would be represented by a section of some [[field bundle]], many such sections are in fact to be regarded as being equivalent. Or more precisely, there should be a _[[groupoid]]_ or _[[∞-groupoid]]_ of field configurations of which the sections of the field bundle only form the space of [[objects]], while the [[gauge transformations]] form the [[morphisms]] and the [[higher gauge transformations]] of order $n$ form the [[n-morphisms]].

   To some extent this is dealt with in traditional [[variational calculus]]: after a choice of [[action functional]] on the space of field configurations, [[BV-BRST formalism]] spits out a [[derived L-∞ algebroid]] whose objects are field configurations, and whose 1-cells are infinitesimal invariances of the given [[action functional]]. 

   This goes in the right direction-- it is the [[Lie differentiation]] of the more encompassing [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] of fields and gauge transformations -- but has several problems, the main one being that this does now know about the [[large gauge transformations]], those which are not connected to the identity (because it only sees infinitesimal data). 
These are important in the full quantum theory. 

Famous examples of the importance of [[large gauge transformations]] appear in

* [[2d CFT]], for which all standard theory would break down if the global [[conformal transformations]] were not considered as gauge transformations.

#### Locality 
 {#IdeaLocality}

Fields defined as sections of field bundles cannot capture gauge phenomena in a _loca_l way, as is necessary for a manifestly local formulation such in [[extended prequantum field theory]], [[extended quantum field theory]] (sometimes called the "multi-tiered" formulation).

   Spcefically, in [[Yang-Mills theory]] for [[gauge group]] $G$, a field configuration -- a _[[gauge field]] configuration_ -- is a combination of an [[instanton sector]] -- modeled by the [[equivalence class]] of a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P$ -- and the "[[gauge potential]]", modeled by a [[connection on a bundle|connection on this bundle]] (see below at _[Gauge fields](#GaugeFields)_ for details).  There is a [[fiber bundle]] $E(P) \to X$ such that its [[sections]] are precisely the [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $P \to X$, and so $\coprod_{c} E(P_c) \to X$, where $c$ ranges over the instanton sectors, is a field bundle for Yang-Mills fields on $X$. 

   But this construction is not local: if we consider this assignment of field bundles to all suitable manifolds $X$, and if $U \to X$ is a cover of $X$, then we cannot in general obtain the field bundle on $X$ by gluing the field bundle on the cover. This is because _locally_ every $G$-[[principal bundle]] has trivial class, so that locally there is always only a single (the trivial) instanton sector. 

Notice that instanton sectors are non-negligible phenomena. For instance the very [[vacuum]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]] is a [[superposition]] of all possible instanton sectors (see at _[[instanton in QCD]] for more on this).  And there are field theories where the fields consist entirely of "[[instanton sectors]]" and where there is no infinitesimal information about the gauge group at all: these are theories whose gauge group is a [[discrete group]], which includes notably [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] and its higher analogy such as the [[Yetter model]]. This means that for these [[theory (physics)|theories]] a local field bundle formalism can see nothing of the actual fields and also traditional tools applied to a global field bundle (such as traditional [[BV-BRST formalism]]) see nothing of the actual fields. All this is fixed by the formulation that we discuss [below](#Definition).


   But this example already points to the general nature of the problem with field bundles, and also to its solution: while the [[instanton]]-component of [[Yang-Mills fields]] are not section of a bundle, they famously are sections of a _[[stack]]_ -- the "[[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of $G$-principal bundles", an object in [[higher geometry]].

   The problem with the locality of the [[field bundle]] for [[Yang-Mills theory]] is solved by passing from [[fiber bundles]] to [[fiber ∞-bundles]]: in the [[smooth ∞-groupoid|higher differential geometry]] there is an object $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$  -- the [[moduli stack]] of $G$-[[principal connections]] (being the [[stackification]] of the [[groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms]]) such that maps $X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ are equivalent to Yang-Mills fields on $X$ (even including their [[gauge transformations]]). This means that if we allow field bundles in higher geometry -- [[fiber ∞-bundles]], then that for Yang-Mills theory over $X$ is even a trivial field bundle, namely the [[projection]]

   $$
     X \times \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to X
   $$

out of the [[product]] of [[spacetime]] with the [[moduli stack]] of fields.

   This is a differential refinement of what is called the trivial _$G$-[[gerbe]]_ on $X$, which is 

   $$
     X \times \mathbf{B}G \to X
   $$

   and hence the "field bundle for instanton sectors" of Yang-Mills fields.


   Judging from these examples one might be tempted to guess that the notion of field [[fiber bundle]] should simply be replaced by that of field [[fiber ∞-bundle]]. But in fact what the example rather suggests is that what matters directly is the [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{Fields}$ of fields, which for $G$-[[Yang-Mills theory]] is simply

   $$
     \mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \,.
   $$

   This perspective, which we describe in detail [below](#Definition) also has the pleasant effect that it drastically simplifies and unifies notions of quantum field theory, for this says equivalently that if only we allow spaces in [[higher geometry]], then [[Yang-Mills theory]] is a _[[sigma-model]]_ quantum field theory: one whose fields are simply maps to a given [[target space]], only that this target space here is a [[stack]].

   But there are more advantages, slightly less obvious. These we come to in the following points.


#### Spin-structures and other $G$-structures
 {#IdeaSpinStructures}

Some fields in physics are (or involve) choices of _[[G-structure]]_ in the sense of [[reduction and lift of structure groups]]. Well-known examples include the choice of _[[orientation]]_ and of _[[Spin structure]]_ in field theories with [[fermion]] fields (discussed in detail in _[Fermions](#Fermions)_ below). Often in the literature the choice of [[orientation]] and [[Spin structure]] is treated as an external parameter, but detailed analysis at least in low-dimensional examples shows that the in the full theory this is really a field configuration. For instance in [[path integral]] [[quantization]] for theories with fermions, part of the integral over all field configurations is a sum over Spin structures.

Now, a spin structure _is_ equivalently a section of something, but again not of a [[principal bundle]], but of an analog in [[higher geometry]], a [[principal 2-bundle]]. 

To see how this works, first recall the case of orientations, whose description as sections of the [[orientation bundle]] is familiar.

For a [[spacetime]] represented by a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$, let 

$$
  \tau_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$ 

be the map that modulates its [[tangent bundle]] (discussed at _[geometry of physics - tangent bundle](geometry of physics#TangentBundle)_). Consider then the following diagram, which shows lifts of this map to the  [[classifying spaces]]/[[moduli stacks]] for various other groups (this is the _[[Whitehead tower]]_ of $\mathbf{B}O(n)$):

$$
  \array{
    && \vdots
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}Spin(n) &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
    \\
    &\mathllap{s_X}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{o_X}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X & \stackrel{e_X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}O(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    &{}_{\mathrlap{\tau_X}} \searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
$$

A lift of the tangent bundle map $\tau_X$ to a map $e_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}O(n)$ as indicated is a choice of [[orthogonal structure]] (a [[vielbein field]], discussed in detail below in _[Ordinary gravity](#OrdinaryGravity)_). For the present discussion asssume that this is given.


The a further lift to $o_X : X \to \mathbf{B}SO(n)$ is a choice of [[orientation]], and finally a lift to $s_X : X \to \mathbf{B}Spin(n)$ is a choice of [[spin structure]].

Now, every hook-shaped sub-[[diagram]] in the above of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\hat G
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^n A
  }
$$

is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]. By the [[universal property]] of the [[homotopy pullback]] this means that the "space" -- really: _[[homotopy type]]_ or just _[[type]]_, for short -- of lifts of a given map $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ to a map $X \to \mathbf{B}\hat G$ is equivalently the type of trivializations of the [[composition|composite]] $X \to \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to} \mathbf{B}^n A$. 

Now if we have an [[orthogonal structure]] $e_X : X \to \mathbf{B}O(n)$ given, then this composite map according to the above diagram is 

$$
  \mathbf{w}_1(e_X)
  \;\colon\;
  X \to \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
  \,.
$$

This represents the [[first Stiefel-Whitney class]] $[w_1(\tau_X)] \in H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ of $\tau_X$, and it classifies a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[principal bundle]], hence a [[double cover]] $\hat X \to X$ and this is precisely the [[orientation bundle]] of $X$. Sections of this bundle are choices of [[orientation]] on $X$, hence are "orientation-structure fields".

Assume then such orientation field $o_X$ is given.
Then in the next step the relevant composite map is

$$
  \mathbf{w}_2(o_X) \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  \,.
$$

This now represents the [[second Stiefel-Whitney class]] $[w_2(\tau_X)] \in H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ of $X$ and classifies a $(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2)$-[[principal 2-bundle]] 

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\mathb{Z}_2 &\to& P
    \\
    && \downarrow 
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

This is sometimes called the _$Spin$-[[lifting bundle gerbe]]_ of $o_X$.
A choice of [[Spin structure]] is a choice of section of this 2-bundle.
Hence spin structures are parts of fields in physics which are not sections of a field 1-bundle. Again, this is faithfully captured only in [[higher geometry]].

This is only the most famous phenomenon in a large class of similar structures of fields in field theory. Notably in higher dimensional [[supergravity]] and in [[string theory]] there are fields which are ever higher lifts through this [[Whitehead tower]] -- [[higher spin structures]], such as [[String structures]] and [[Fivebrane structures]] in the next two steps. Accordingly, these are fields which are equivalently sections of [[principal 3-bundles]] (the "[[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]") and [[principal infinity-bundle|principal 7-bundles]] (the "[[Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle]]").

#### Background fields
 {#BackgroundFields}

Comparison of the above discussions under _[Locality](#IdeaLocality)_ and _[Spin structures](#IdeaSpinStructures)_  shows that there we had a higher-geometric field bundle of [[Yang-Mills fields]] which was hower "trivial" in the sense that it was a projection out of the [[product]] of [[spacetime]] with a [[moduli stack]], so that a field configuration was equivalently of [[sigma-model]]-type, namely simply a map $\phi \colon : X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$; whereas here the "spin-lifting 2-bundles" and its higher analogs are, in general, not of this product form, hence "Spin structure"-fields, at least superficially do not seem to be of [[sigma-model]]-type, even in [[higher geometry]].

But a closer inspection shows that in fact both situations are entirely analogous -- once we realize that here these Spin-structure fields are not really defined just on $X$, but on $X$ _equipped with its orientation_ $o_X$. Since, by the same logic as above, also the orientation is a "field", we may call it a ***[[background field]]***. It serves as "background" over which spin structure fields can be considered.

In [[higher geometry]] incarnated naturally as [[(∞,1)-topos theory|higher topos theory]], this state of affairs is naturally modeled and indeed yields again a _moduli stack of spin structure fields_ and makes spin-structures be [[sigma-model]]-type fields, as follows:

the natural way to regard both $X$ as well as its orientation structure $o_X$ as a single object is to regard the map $X \stackrel{o_X}{\to} \mathbf{B}SO(n)$ as an object in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos|slice (2,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}SO(n)}$. In here an [[object]] is a map of [[stacks]] into $\mathbf{B}SO(n)$, and a morphism is map of the domains of these maps together with a [[homotopy]] filling the evident triangle [[diagram]]. Notably a lift of the orientation structure $o_X$ to a spin structure $s_X$ as above, hence a diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{s_X}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}Spin(n)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{o_X}}\searrow &\swArrow_\simeq& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{SpinStruc}_n}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}O(n)
  }
$$ 

is equivalently a map 

$$
  o_X \to \mathbf{SpinStruc}_n
$$

in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}SO(n)}$. This is again of the same simple form of the Yang-Mills fields on $X$, which are maps

$$
  X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \,,
$$

but in the collection of stacks $\mathbf{H}$ itself, not in a [[slice (infinity,1)-topos|slice]].

The slice here encodes the presence of [[background fields]] -- namely orientations in this case -- whose [[moduli stack]] in turn is, in this case, $\mathbf{B}SO(n)$. 

Notice that also the field of [[gravity]] has a background field in this precise sense: as metioned above, a gravitational field configuration is a lift of $\tau_X$ through $\mathbf{B}O(n) \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to} \mathbf{B}GL(n)$, hence a map

$$
  \tau_X \to \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
$$

in the slice $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}$. (Discussed in detail in _[Ordinary gravity](#OrdinaryGravity)_ below.) Hence also [[gravity]] becomes a [[sigma-model]]-type field theory in [[higher geometry]]. Notice that here it is [[smooth structure]] on $X$, as embodied in $\tau_X$, which is the background.

Now, at least for the field of gravity one can of course emulate the fields also by sections of a field bundle (while already for the second next step in the Whitehead tower, Spin structures, this is no longer the case, as we have seen). But even so, the field bundle formalism clearly misses then the relation between fields and background fields.

In particular for two reasons

1. Typically the presence of background fields indicates that in a more comprehensive discussion background fields are also fields that vary;

1. Often background fields on one space affect fields on _another_ space.

An archetypical example for both these effects combined is 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] with a compact, simple and simply connected [[gauge group]] $G$ in the presence of [[Wilson lines]]. This is a [[theory (physics)|theory]] on 3-dimensional [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $\Sigma$ whose fields are $G$-[[gauge fields]] as for [[Yang-Mills theory]] above, hence given by maps $\Phi \colon \Sigma \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$. At the same time, this theory has a "coupling" to a 1-dimensional [[theory (physics)|theory]] which describes [[particles]] propagating around [[knots]] $C : S^1 \to \Sigma$ in $\Sigma$ for which the restriction $\Phi|_C$ serves as the [[background gauge field]]. Specifically, a field configuration of this 1-dimensional theory is equivalently a map in the slice $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G_{conn}}$ which in $\mathbf{H}$ is given by a diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
   S^1 &&\to&& \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g}//T)
   \\
   & {}_{\mathllap{C}}\searrow &\swArrow& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{OrbitStruct}}}
   \\
   && \mathbf{B}G_{conn} 
  }
$$ 

for some map on the right which we discuss in detail below in _[Chern-Simons fields with Wilson line fields](#ChernSimonsWithWilsonLines)_.

Here considering just these fields in the background of a fixed $\Phi|_C$ produced a 1-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] whose [[partition function]] is that "[[Wilson loop]]" observable of $\Phi|_C$. But this is not considered in isolation. The whole point of the relation of [[Chern-Simons theory]] to the [[Jones polynomial]] [[knot invariant]] of the [[knot]] $C$ is that one consider also $\Phi$ as a dynamical field, not as a fixed background. Indeed, in the full theory of Chern-Simons with Wilson loops that includes both the fields on $\Sigma$ as well as those on the knot, a field configuration is the diagram as above but regarded as the square 

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\to& \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{C}}\downarrow 
    &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{OrbitStruc}}}
    \\
    \Sigma &\stackrel{\Phi}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  }
  \,,
$$

hence, again, a single map

$$
  C \to \mathbf{OrbiStruc}
$$

but now in the [[arrow category]] $\mathbf{H}^{(\Delta^1)}$.

This subtle interplay of "bulk fields" and "[[QFT with defects|defect fields]]" which is here captured most naturally in terms of [[higher geometry]] cannot really be expressed accurately just in terms of field bundles.


#### Higher gauge fields
 {#HigherGaugeFields}

Above we have seen the generalization of field bundles to [[higher geometry]] already for traditional notions such as Yang-Mills fields and Spin-structures. But many [[theory (physics)|theories]] considered in
in theoretical physics have fields that are more "explicitly" entities in [[higher geometry]].

For instance the higher analog of the [[electromagnetic field]] which is called the _[[B-field]]_ or _[[Kalb-Ramond field]]_ is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|2-connection]] on a [[principal 2-bundle]]. There is no way to faithfully encode this as a section of any ordinary [[fiber bundle]]. It follows that for instance also the [magnetic charge anomaly](magnetic+charge#MagneticChargeAnomaly) (as discussed there) has no accurate description in terms of field bundles. Next the [[supergravity C-field]] is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|3-connection]] on a [[principal 3-bundle]], and so on.

There is a wide variety of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theories]] whose fields are such [[higher gauge fields]]. In some traditional literature one sees parts of this theory be discussed by standard [[BV-BRST formalism]] applied to [[field bundles]], namely by ignoring the non-trivial [[instanton sectors]] and pretending that a field configuration for these [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]] are given by globally dedined [[differential forms]]. In some special cases (for instance for [[spacetimes]]/[[worldvolumes]] of very special topology or low [[dimension]) this can be sufficient to capture everything, but in general (for instance for $U(1)$-[[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] and its [[holographic principle|holographically dual]] [[self-dual higher gauge theory]]) it is not.


### The solution: Field $\infty$-bundles and moduli $\infty$-stacks of fields

By the [above](#IdeaOfFieldBundlesAndItsProblems), defining a physical field to be a section of some bundle goes in the right direction, but misses crucial aspects of physical fields. These problems are fixed by passing to [[higher geometry]].

Below in _[Definition](#Definition)_ we discuss a natural unified formulation of the notion of physical field in terms of [[higher geometry]] (the central definition being def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} ) and then we spell out many [Examples](#Examples).

## Definition 
 {#Definition}

We give a general abstract definition of physical fields in 

* _[Physical fields](#DefinitionPhysicalField)_

Then we consider some general abstract operations on fields in 

* _[Restriction and pullback of fields](RestrictionAndPullback)_



### Physical fields
 {#DefinitionPhysicalField}

A notion of _field_ in physics is part of a specification of _[[theory (physics)|physical theory]]_ or _[[model (physics)|physical model]]_. We consider specifically the framework of [[prequantum field theory]]. Here a [[theory (physics)|theory]]/[[model (physics)|model]] is specified by (or at least comes with) an _[[action functional]]_. The _field_ content of the theory is part of the specification of the [[domain]] of the action functional. Therefore in def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} below we define _action functionals_ and the fields relative to this notion.

We work in the following context.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Context

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. For many of the examples below it is furthermore assumed that $\mathbf{H}$ is equipped with [[differential cohesion]]. This implies in particular that there is a notion of [[smooth manifold]] [[internalization|internal]] to $\mathbf{H}$.

Fix $\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ a [[group object in an (∞,1)-category|group object]] in $\mathbf{H}$, hence a cohesive [[∞-group]].

=--



For the main definition below we need the following basic notation.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $B \in \mathbf{H}$ any [[object]], and $X,A \in \mathbf{H}_{/B}$ two objects in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]], write

$$
  [X,A]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \coloneqq
  \underset{B}{\prod} [X,A]
  \in \mathbf{H}
$$

for the $\mathbf{H}$-valued [[hom object]] between $X$ and $A$: the [[dependent product]] over $B \to *$ of the [[internal hom]] $[X, A] \in \mathbf{H}_{/B}$.

The following defines the notion of _[[action functional]]_ and as part of the data it defines the notion of _physical field_.

+-- {: .num_defn #FieldsInAnActionFunctional}
###### Definition

Given an [[object]] $\mathbf{BgFields} \in \mathbf{H}$ and 
given two objects, to be denoted $\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}  \in \mathbf{H}_{/B}$, in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos|slice]] over $\mathbf{BgFields}$,
then an **[[action functional]]** in ($\mathbf{H}, \mathbb{G})$ "on fields on $X$" is a [[morphism]]

$$
  S \;\colon\; [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}} \to \mathbb{G}
  \,.
$$

In this context we say that

* the [[dependent sum]] $X \coloneqq \underset{\mathbf{BgField}}{\sum} \Phi_X$ is the **[[worldvolume]]** or **[[spacetime]]**;

* the morphism $\Phi_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{BgFields}$ is the **[[background field]]**;

* the object $\mathbf{Fields}$ is the **[[moduli ∞-stack]] of fields**;

* the [[elements]] of $[\Phi_X,\mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$, hence (see prop. \ref{GlobalPointsOfModuliOfFields} below) the morphisms

  $$
    \phi \;\colon\; \Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields}
  $$

  in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$, hence the [[diagrams]]

  $$
    \array{
       X &&\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&& \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\sum} \mathbf{Fields}
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\Phi_X}}\searrow 
       &\swArrow& 
       \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{Fields}}}
       \\
       && \mathbf{BgFields}
    }
  $$

  in $\mathbf{H}$, are the **fields** on $X$;

* a **[[gauge transformation]]** is a [[homotopy]] in $[\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$, hence a

  $$
    \phi \Rightarrow \phi'
  $$

* a **[[higher gauge transformation]]** is a [[higher homotopy]] in $[\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$.

###### Remark

The above says in particular that in [[higher geometry]] all fields are [[sigma-model]] fields: if we regard the [[moduli ∞-stack]] $\mathbf{Fields}$ as the [[target space]].

### Restriction and pullback of physical fields
 {#RestrictionAndPullback}

It is familiar from basic examples that not every type of physical field on a [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$ can be pulled back (in the sense of pullback of functions) along any [[smooth function]] $f \;\colon\;Y \to X$. For instance the field of [[gravity]], a [[vielbein field]] or [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo]]-[[Riemannian metric]], discussed below in _[Ordinary graviry](#OrdinaryGravity)_ may be pulled back only along [[local diffeomorphisms]]. More generally, one needs other [[properties]] on $f$ to pull back a given field and in fact in general one needs [[extra structure]]. 

In view of def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} above this is immediate: by that definition a field on $X$ in general does not just depend on $X$, but in fact also on the background field structure denoted $\Phi_X$. Accordingly, it can be pulled back only along maps that also carry this background field structure along.

+-- {: .num_remark #PullbackAlongGeneralizedLocalDiffeomorphisms}
###### Remark

Since by def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} a physical field is a map $\phi \colon \Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields}$ in 
$\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$, it may be "pulled back" along maps  of [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $f \colon Y \to X$ when these are extended to maps $\Phi_Y \to \Phi_X$ in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$ of the [[background fields]], hence to [[diagrams]] in $\mathbf{H}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    Y &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\Phi_Y}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\kappa}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{Phi_X}}
    \\
    && 
    \mathbf{BgFields}
  }
  \,,
$$

hence maps $f : X \to Y$ equipped with a choice of [[equivalence]] 

$$
  \kappa ;\colon\; f^*\Phi_X \simeq \Phi_Y 
$$

between the [[background fields]].

### Moduli stacks of fields
 {#ModuliStacksOfFields}

The object $[\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}} \in \mathbf{H}$
of def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} we may call the 
[[moduli ∞-stack]] of fields. Here we discuss various properties of this object. 

+-- {: .num_prop #GlobalPointsOfModuliOfFields}
###### Proposition

The [[∞-groupoid]] of global [[elements]] of $[X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$ is 

$$
  \mathbf{H}(*,[\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}_{\mathbf{H}}])
  \simeq
  \Gama [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \simeq
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}(\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using the [[adjunction]] [[equivalences]] we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}(*, [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}})
    & \simeq
    \mathbf{H}(*, \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\prod} [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}])
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}(\mathbf{BgFields}^*(*), [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}])
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}(*, [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}])
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}(\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields})
  \end{aligned}
$$

where the first line is the definition, the second is the $(\mathbf{BgFields}^* \dashv \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\prod})$ [[adjunction]]-[[equivalence]], the third is the $(\underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\sum} \dashv \mathbf{BgFields}^*)$-adjunction implying that $\mathbf{BgFields}^*$ preserves the [[terminal object]], and finally the last line is the defining [[internal hom]] [[adjunction]]-[[equivalence]].

+-- {: .num_prop #ModuliStackOfFieldsAsHomotopyFiber}
###### Proposition

The [[moduli ∞-stack]] of fields $[\Phi_X, \mathbf{BgFields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$ sits in a [[homotopy pullback]] [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}
    &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    [X, \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\sum}\mathbf{Fields}]

    [X, \mathbf{BgFields}]
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark #}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{ModuliStackOfFieldsAsHomotopyFiber} makes precise the heuristic idea that a field $\phi \in [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$ is 

1. a configuration $\phi_X \;\colon\; X \to \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\sum}\mathbf{Fields}$ on [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$;

1. together with a [[gauge transformation]] $\kappa_{\phi} \;\colon\;  \Phi_X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{Fields}\circ \phi_X$ between the fixed [[background field]] and the background field induced by $\phi_X$.

### Relation to twisted cohomology
 {#RelationToTwistedCohomology}

The definition \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} of fields has an entirely equivalent expression in terms of [[cocycles]] in [[cohomology]] and in fact in [[twisted cohomology]] if the [[background field]] is nontrivial.

This follows by direct comparison with the corresponding notions in _[[cohomology]]_ and _[[twisted cohomology]]_ as discussed there ([NSS](#NSS))

In the [[diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
     X &&\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&& \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\sum} \mathbf{Fields}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Phi_X}}\searrow 
     &\swArrow& 
     \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{Fields}}}
     \\
     && \mathbf{BgFields}
  }
$$

of \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} we may equivalently say that

* the object $\mathbf{Fields} \in \matbbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$ is the [[local coefficient ∞-bundle]];

* the [[homotopy fiber]] $V$ of $\underset{\phi \in [X, \mathbf{Fields}]}{\sum}\mathbf{Fields} \to \mathbf{BgFields}$ is the local [[coefficient]] for a [[cohomology]] theory;

* the [[background field]] $\Phi_X$ is the **twist**

* the field $\phi \colon \Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields}$ is 

  * a [[cocycle]] in $\Phi_X$-[[twisted cohomology]] on $X$ with local [[coefficients]] $V$

  * equivalently: a $\Phi_X$-twisted [[G-structure|V-structure]] on $X$;

* a [[gauge transformation]] is a [[coboundary]] in $\Phi_X$-twisted $V$-cohomology;

* the [[equivalence classes]] of fields are the $\Phi_X$-[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] $V$-[[cohomology]] of [[spacetime]] $X$

  $$
    H_{[\Phi_X]}(X,V) \simeq \tau_0\Gamma[X,\mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}
    \,.
  $$

## Examples
 {#Examples}

We distinguish four broad classes of examples of physical fields, according to def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional}:

1. [Scalar and moduli fields](#SclarModuliFields)

   The simplest type of field is a ([[smooth function|smooth]]) [[function]] on [[spacetime]] $X$ with values in the [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]], called a _[[scalar field]]_. Slightly more generally there are fields which are [[functions]] into some other [[vector space]] or more general [[manifold]], often called _linear/non-linear [[sigma-model]]_ fields. Often that manifold is a space of parameters of some [[geometry]], for instance of a compact space in [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]], in which case these fields are often called _moduli fields_. Scalar fields may be _charged_ under force fields, which we turn to next.

1. [Force fields](#ForceFields)

   1. [Fields of gravity, G-structure and generalized geometry](#FieldsOfGravityAndGeneralizedGeometry)

      In this case the [[background gauge field]] is a [[G-structure]], the [[moduli stack]] of fields is a [[delooping|delooped]] [[∞-group extension]] $\mathbf{B}\hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ and a field is a generalized [[vielbein]] exhibiting a [[reduction and lift of structure groups|reduction/lift of structure group]].

   1. [Gauge fields](#GaugeFields)

      In this case $\mathbf{Fields}$ is a [[moduli space]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ of [[connections on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]] on $G$-[[principal ∞-bundles]] for some [[gauge group]] $G \in Grpd(\mathbf{H})$.

1. [Matter fields](#MatterFields)

   In this case the [[background gauge field]] is a $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $P$ for some [[gauge group]] $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ and $\mathbf{Fields}$ is the univeral $\rho$-[[associated ∞-bundle]] $V//G \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ for $\rho$ an [[∞-action]] of $G$ on some $V \in \mathbf{H}$. A field is [[section]] of the [[associated ∞-bundle|associated]] $V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]].

   
Not all examples fall squarely into one of these types, some are mixtures of these. Relevant examples we discuss in

* [Fields combining various of these properties](#FieldCombiningVariousProperties)

In particular the moduli stacks $\mathbf{B}G$ here are typically all differentially refined to $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ so that for instance every [[reduction and lift of structure groups]] goes along with a corresponding data of the reduction of an [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connection]]. The archetypical example for this are [[spin connections]], see the example _[Ordinary gravity](#OrdinaryGravity)_ below.

### **0)** Sigma-model fields

[[sigma-model]]

#### Particle

[[particle]]

$\mathbf{Fields} = $ [[spacetime]]

#### Charged particle

[[1d Chern-Simons theory]]

Let $T \hookrightarrow G$ be [[maximal torus]] which fixes a given 
[[weight (in representation theory)]] $\langle \lambda, -\rangle$ on compact simple and simply connected [[Lie group]] $G$. Let $\rho$ be the corresponding [[representation]] under the [[Borel-Weil-Bott theorem]].

Then the topological part of the [[sigma model]] for the [[particle]] charged under $(G,\rho)$ in some $G$-[[background gauge field]] has

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
  \to 
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//G
  \simeq
   \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
$$


### **I)** Force fields
 {#ForceFields}

The two classes of [[force]] fields are:

* [Fields of gravity, G-structure and generalized geometry](#FieldsOfGravityAndGeneralizedGeometry);

* [Gauge fields](#GaugeFields).


#### **I a)** Fields of gravity, $G$-Structure and generalized geometry
 {#FieldsOfGravityAndGeneralizedGeometry}

We discuss the example of the field of [[gravity]], below in _[Gravity](#OrdinaryGravity)_, and various closely related types of fields that all encode [[geometry]] in some sense, in fact all encode geometry in the sense of _[[G-structure]]_. This most general case we discuss in _[G-structure -- (twisted lift of structure ∞-groups)](#GStructure)_.

##### **General** -- $G$-structure: (twisted) lift of structure $\infty$-group
 {#GStructure}

Let 

$$
  A \to \hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{p}}{\to} G
$$

be an [[∞-group extension]] in $\mathbf{H}$. Then for $g_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}G$ a given $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]], a [[lift of the structure group]] from $G$ to $\hat G$ is a field

$$
  \phi \; \colon\; g_X \to \mathbf{B p}
  \,.
$$

If the [[∞-extension]] is central in that it extends to a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of the form

$$
  \mathbf{B}A \to \mathbf{B}\hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{Bp}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to} \mathbf{B}^2 A
$$

then a [[twisted c-structure]] is a map

$$
  \phi 
   \;\colon\;
  g_X \to \mathbf{c}
  \,.
$$

These kinds of fields are interpreted as field of [[gravity]] and its variants.


##### Gravity

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let 

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}O(n)
   \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$

the [[delooping]] of the [[Lie group|Lie]]-[[subgroup]] inclusion of the [[orthogonal group]] into the [[general linear group]] in [[dimension]] $n$ (the inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]]).

For $X \in $ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow$ $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$, write

$$
  \Phi_X \coloneqq \tau_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$

for the canonical map modulating the $GL(n)$-[[principal bundle]] to which the [[tangent bundle]] is canonically [[associated bundle|associated]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #RiemannianVielbein}
###### Example

Morphisms

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \tau_X \to \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
$$

in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}$ hence [[diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}O(n)
    \\
    & \searrow &\swArrow_{e}& \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$ are equivalently [[vielbein]] fields $e$ exhibiting the [[reduction of the structure group]] from $GL(n)$ to $O(n)$. A [[gauge transformation]] is a local frame transformation. Hence 

$$
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[moduli stack]] of [[Riemannian metrics]] on $X$. Every such is a field configuration of ordinary [[gravity]] on $X$. (But see example \ref{GenerallyCovariantFieldOfGravity} below.)

According to 
remark \ref{PullbackAlongGeneralizedLocalDiffeomorphisms} such fields pull back along map $f \colon Y \to X$ that fit into a diagram

$$
  \array{
    Y &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\tau_Y}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\tau_X}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
  \,.
$$ 

These are precisely [[local diffeomorphisms]] and indeed these are precisely the maps along which [[vielbein]] fields / [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] fiedls pull back. (Pullback along [[smooth functions]] may not preserve the non-degeneracy of a metric tensor, but precisely the local diffeomorphisms do.)

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[smooth structure]] on $X$ as embodied by $\tau_X$ is the [[background field]] in example \ref{RiemannianVielbein}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n$ is the [[coset space]] $GL(n)//O(n)$, hence we have a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of [[moduli stacks]] of the form

$$
  GL(n)//O(n)
  \to
  \mathbf{B}O(n)
  \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$. This means that locally, over a [[cover]] ([[1-epimorphism]]) $p \colon U \to X$ over which the [[tangent bundle]] has a trivialization $\tau_X|_U \simeq *$, the space of fields is simply $[U, GL(n)//O(n)]$.

=--

The next example is the differential refinement of the previous one.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Let 

$$
  \widehat \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}
$$

be the canonical differential refinement of $\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n$, where now the [[moduli stacks]] of [[principal connections]] appear. For $X$ a manifold as above, let then

$$
  \hat \tau_X 
  \;\colon\;
  X 
  \to
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}
$$

modulate an [[affine connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]]. A field 

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \hat \tau_X \to \widehat \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
$$

is now still equivalently just a [[vielbein]], but its component

$$
  \underset{\mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}}{\sum} \hat \tau_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \to \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn}
$$

now captures the orthognal connection which in the physics literature is often called (inaccurately) the _[[spin connection]]_, denoted $\omega$. The [[vielbein]] then exhibits the original [[affine connection]] as that whose components are the [[Christoffel symbols]] $\Gamma$ of the [[Riemannian metric]] defined as above, a relation that is familiar from the physics literature in the form of the [[equation]]

$$
  \omega = e^{-1}\Gamma e + e^{-1} d e
$$

between local connection 1-form components.

=--

But both these examples do not fully accurately reflect the field content of [[gravity]] yet. This is because the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[gravity]] is supposed to by [[general covariance|generally covariant]]. This means that for two [[vielbein]] field configurations as in example \ref{RiemannianVielbein} such that one goes into the other under a [[diffeomorphism]] of [[spacetime]] $X$, there is a [[gauge transformation]] between them.

+-- {: .num_example #GenerallyCovariantFieldOfGravity}
###### Example

Write $\mathbf{Diff}(X) \coloneqq \mathbf{Aut}(X) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ for the [[diffeomorphism group]] of the [[smooth manifold]] $X$. There is then the canonical [[∞-action]] of the [[automorphism ∞-group]] $\mathbf{Diff}(X)$ on $X$ itself, exhibited by the universal [[associated ∞-bundle]]

$$
  \left(X // \mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right) \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right) \right)
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right)}
  \,.
$$

This induces also an [[∞-action]] also on the [[tangent bundle]].

Moreover the trivial bundle

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \coloneqq
  (\mathbf{Diff}(X)\times \mathbf{OrthStruc} \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}(X) )
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}(X)}
$$

corresponds to the trivial action.

Then

$$
  \underset{\mathbf{B}Diff(n)}{\sum}
  \underset{\mathbf{B}(GL(n))}{\prod} 
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{Fields}]
 \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the accurate space of [[general covariance|generally covariant]] fields of [[gravity]].

The term _gauge field_ in _[[gauge theory]]_ with respect to a [[gauge group]] $G$ refers to fields which are modeled by [[connection on a bundle|connections]] either on $G$-[[principal bundles]] or on [[associated bundles]] for these. The notion of [[equivalence]] between two such fields (hence between [[connections on bundles]]) is the original meaning of the word _[[gauge transformation]]_, even though that term is also used for equivalences between fields which are not modeled by connections.

Nevertheless, tensor fields, being [[sections]] of a [[tensor product]] of copies of the [[tangent bundle]] and the [[cotangent bundle]] are certainly examples of the general notion of field as in def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional}. Gere we spell this out.

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], a [[tensor field]] of rank $(p,q)$ is a [[section]] of the [[tensor product]] bundle

$$
  \Gamma(T X)^{\otimes_{C^\infty(X)} p} \otimes_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)^{\otimes q}
  \,. 
$$

This is canonically the [[associated bundle]] to the $GL(n)$-[[principal bundle]] which to which the [[tangent bundle]] is also canonically associated, by the given [[representation]] of $GL(n)$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n(p+q)}$.

The [[universal associated ∞-bundle]] of this representation is 

$\mathbf{Fields} 
\;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n (p+q)}//GL(n) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) $.

Hence for $\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$ the canonical map, the space of $(p,q)$-tensor fields on $X$ is

$$
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \in
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

By passing to [[irreducible representations]] in the above, we obtain specifically the corresponding subclasses of tensor fields, such as [[differential forms]].
