## Idea

In fundamental [[physics]] the basic entities that are being described are called _fields_, as they appear in the terms _[[classical field theory]]_ and _[[quantum field theory]]_.

The basic example that probably gives the whole concept is name is the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]] in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[electromagnetism]]: if we fix a [[coordinate chart]] of [[spacetime]], then the [[electromagnetic field]] splits into the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]] which are both modeled by a _[[vector field]]_, traditionally denoted $\vec E$ and $\vect B$, respectively, on this coordinate chart. The value $\vec E(x)$ of the vector field at a given point of spacetime is a [[vector]] that expresses the magnitude and direction of the electric [[force]] that is excerted on an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] [[particle]] at $x$. 

But in general a _field_ in physics need not be a [[vector field]]. In fact more fundamentally, if we do not specify a [[coordinate chart]], then the [[electromagnetic field]] is not in fact represented by two fector field. Rather, its [[field strength]] is represented by a [[differential 2-form]] and the the whole field as such is a [[cocycle]] of degree-2 in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]: a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle bundle with connection]].

Similar statements hold for all [[forces]] of nature, such as the force of [[gravity]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] and [[strong nuclear force]]: a configuration of these is mathematically modeled by what mathematically are _[[tensor]] fields_ and [[connection on a bundle|connections]], hence one speaks of the _field of gravity_ etc.

The [[electromagnetic field]] and the field of [[gravity]] are the physical fields that historically gave rise to what is now called _[[classical field theory]]_. But it turns out that fundamentally, in [[quantum physics]], also all [[matter]] in physics is constituted by fields in a similar sense. Specifically, where [[force]] fields in physics are usually [[connection on a bundle|connections on a bundle]], matter fields are [[sections]] of bundles. 

Indeed, a standard proposals to formalize the notion of _physical field_ is to declare that a [[physical system]] comes with a [[fiber bundle]] $E \to X$ over the [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$, and that a field configuration of the system is a [[section]] of this field bundle, see for instance the discussion at the beginning of _[[multisymplectic geometry]]_ for more on such field bundles. (Also connections can be encoded as sections of suitable bundles).

While this goes in the right direction, it cannot be quite the final answer:

some fields considered in theoretical physics are sections of/connections on not an ordinary [[fiber bundle]], but a [[higher geometry|higher geomtric]] fiber bundle: a [[fiber âˆž-bundle]]. For instance the higher analog of the [[electromagnetic field]] which is called the _[[B-field]]_ or _[[Kalb-Ramond field]]_ is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|2-connection]] on a [[principal 2-bundle]]. There is no way to faithfully encode this as a secton of any ordinary [[fiber bundle]]. For instance an accurate description of _[[magnetic charge]]_ (as discussed there) shows that it is represented by such a 2-connection.
