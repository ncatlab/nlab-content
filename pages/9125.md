## Idea

In fundamental [[physics]] the basic entities that are being described are called _fields_, as they appear in the terms _[[classical field theory]]_ and _[[quantum field theory]]_.

### General

The basic example that probably gives the whole concept its name is the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]] in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[electromagnetism]]: if we fix a [[coordinate chart]] of [[spacetime]], then the [[electromagnetic field]] splits into the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]] which are both modeled by a _[[vector field]]_, traditionally denoted $\vec E$ and $\vec B$, respectively, on this coordinate chart. The value $\vec E(x)$ of the vector field at a given point of spacetime is a [[vector]] that expresses the magnitude and direction of the electric [[force]] that is exerted on an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] [[particle]] at $x$. 

In fact more fundamentally, if we do not specify a [[coordinate chart]], then the [[electromagnetic field]] is not in fact represented by two vector fields. Rather, its [[field strength]] is represented by a [[differential 2-form]], hence a [[tensor field]] of rank $(0,2)$, but the the whole field as such is not a tensor field, but is a [[cocycle]] of degree-2 in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]: a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle bundle with connection]].

Or for instance the field of [[gravity]] if modeled as a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] is a [[tensor field]] of rank $(2,0)$ -- but subject to the constraint that this be pointwise non-degenerate. More fundamentally the field of gravity is instead a [[vielbein field]].

Similar statements hold for all [[forces]] of nature, such as the force of [[gravity]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] and [[strong nuclear force]]: a configuration of these is mathematically modeled by [[connection on a bundle|connections]]. Their [[field strengths]] are rank $(0,2)$-tensor fields.

The [[electromagnetic field]] and the field of [[gravity]] are the physical fields that historically gave rise to what is now called _[[classical field theory]]_. But it turns out that fundamentally, in [[quantum physics]], also all [[matter]] in physics is constituted by fields in a similar sense. Specifically, where [[force]] fields in physics are usually [[connection on a bundle|connections on a bundle]], matter fields are [[sections]] of [[associated bundles]]. 


### The idea of field bundles and its problems
 {#IdeaOfFieldBundlesAndItsProblems}

A widespread proposal for how to formalize the notion of _physical field_ is to declare that the specification of a [[physical system]] comes with a [[fiber bundle]] $E \to X$ over the [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$ called the **[[field bundle]]** and that a field configuration of the system is a [[section]] of this field bundle. This is for instance the basis for the theory of the [[variational bicomplex]], for standard [[multisymplectic geometry]], etc.

While this goes in the right direction, it cannot be quite the final answer as it misses crucial properties that are expected of a notion of field. We now discuss these problems and indicate their solution by a more natural notion of field moduli in [[higher geometry]], which we discuss in detail [below](#Definition).


#### Large gauge transformations 

In [[gauge theory]] specifically but in [[physics]] generally, physical fields come equipped with a notion of which fields configurations, while nominally different, are [[equivalence|equivalent]], called _[[gauge equivalence|gauge equivalent]]_. This means that generically for any [[physical theory]], even if all field configurations would be represented by a section of some [[field bundle]], many such sections are in fact to be regarded as being equivalent. Or more precisely, there should be a _[[groupoid]]_ or _[[(∞,1)-groupoid]]_ of field configurations of which the sections of the field bundle only form the space of [[objects]].

   To some extent this is dealt with in traditional [[variational calculus]]: after a choice of [[action functional]] on the space of field configurations, [[BV-BRST formalism]] spits out a [[derived L-∞ algebroid]] whose objects are field configurations, and whose 1-cells are infinitesimal invariances of the given [[action functional]]. 

   This goes in the right direction, but has several problems, the main one being that this does now know about the [[large gauge transformations]], those which are not connected to the identity (because it only sees infinitesimal data). These are important in the full quantum theory. (Famous examples include [[2d CFT]], for which all standard theory would break down if the global [[conformal transformations]] were not considered as gauge transformations.)

#### Locality 

Fields defined as sections of field bundles cannot capture gauge phenomena in a _loca_l way, as is necessary for a manifestly local formulation such in [[extended prequantum field theoiry]], [[extended quantum field theory]] (sometimes called the "multi-tiered" formulation).

   Spcefically, in [[Yang-Mills theory]] for [[gauge group]] $G$, a field configuration -- a _[[gauge field]] configuration_ -- is a combination of an [[instanton sector]] -- modeled by the [[equivalence class]] of a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P$ -- and the "[[gauge potential]]", modeled by a [[connection on a bundle|connection on this bundle]] (see below at _[Gauge fields](#GaugeFields)_ for details).  There is a [[fiber bundle]] $E(P) \to X$ such that its [[sections]] are precisely the [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $P \to X$, and so $\coprod_{c} E(P_c) \to X$, where $c$ ranges over the instanton sectors, is a field bundle for Yang-Mills fields on $X$. 

   But this construction is not local: if we consider this assignment of field bundles to all suitable manifolds $X$, and if $U \to X$ is a cover of $X$, then we cannot in general obtain the field bundle on $X$ by gluing the field bundle on the cover. This is because _locally_ every $G$-[[principal bundle]] has trivial class, so that locally there is always only a single (the trivial) instanton sector. 

   Notice that instanton sectors are non-negligible phenomena. For instance the very [[vacuum]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]] is a [[superposition]] of all possible instanton sectors (see at _[[instanton in QCD]] for more on this). 

   But this example already points to the general nature of the problem with field bundles, and also to its solution: while the [[instanton]]-component of [[Yang-Mills fields]] are not section of a bundle, they famously are sections of a _[[stack]]_ -- the "[[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of $G$-principal bundles", an object in [[higher geometry]].

   The problem with the locality of the [[field bundle]] for [[Yang-Mills theory]] is solved by passing from [[fiber bundles]] to [[fiber ∞-bundles]]: in the [[smooth ∞-groupoid|higher differential geometry]] there is an object $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$  -- the [[moduli stack]] of $G$-[[principal connections]], being the [[stackification]] of the [[groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms]] -- such that maps $X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ are equivalent to Yang-Mills fields on $X$ (even including their [[gauge transformations]]). This means that if we allow field bundles in higher geometry -- [[fiber ∞-bundles]], then that for Yang-Mills theory over $X$ is even a trivial field bundle, namely the [[projection]]

   $$
     X \times \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to X
     \,.
   $$

   This is a differential refinement of what is called the trivial _$G$-[[gerbe]]_ on $X$, which is 

   $$
     X \times \mathbf{B}G \to X
   $$

   and hence the "field bundle for instanton sectors" of Yang-Mills fields.

   Judging from this example one might be tempted to guess that the notion of field [[fiber bundle]] should simply be replaced by that of field [[fiber ∞-bundle]]. But in fact what the example rather suggests is that what matters directly is the [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{Fields}$ of fields, which for $G$-[[Yang-Mills theory]] is simply

   $$
     \mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \,.
   $$

   This perspective, which we descrive in detail [below](#Definition) also has the pleasant effect that it drastically simplifies and unifies notions of quantum field theory, for this says equivalently that if only we allow spaces in [[higher geometry]], then [[Yang-Mills theory]] is a [[sigma-model]] quantum field theory: one whose fields are simply maps to a given [[target space]], only that this target space here is a [[stack]].

   But there are more advantages, slightly less obvious. These we come to in the following points.


#### Spin-structures and other $G$-structures

Some fields in physics are (or involve) choices of [[G-structure]] in the sense of [[reduction and lift of structure groups]]. The most famous example is the choice of [[Spin structure]] in field theories with [[fermion]]fields (discussed in detail in [Fermions](#Fermions) below). Often in the literature the choice of [[Spin structure]] is treated as an external parameter, but detailed analysis at least in low-dimensional examples shows that the in the full theory this is really a field configuraton. For instance in [[path integral]] [[quantization]] for theories with fermions, part of the integral over all field configurations is a sum over Spin structures.

Now, a spin structure _is_ equivalently a section of something, but again not of a [[principal bundle]], but of an analog in [[higher geometry]], a [[principal 2-bundle]]. Concretely, for a [[spacetime]] represented by a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $B$, let $\tau_X : X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$ be the map that modulates its [[tangent bundle]]. Then a choice of [[Spin structure]] on $X$ is a lift of this map three steps through through the [[Whitehead tower]] of $\mathbf{B}GL(n)$:

$$
  \array{
    && \vdots
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}Spin(n) &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
    \\
    &\mathllap{s_X}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{o_X}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X & \stackrel{e_X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}O(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    &{}_{\mathrlap{\tau_X}} \searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
$$

A lift of the tangent bundle $\tau_X$ to $e_X$ is a choice of [[orthogonal structure]] (a [[vielbein field]], discussed in detail below in _[Ordinary gravity](#OrdinaryGravity)_), further to $o_X$ is a choice of [[orientation]], further to $s_X$ is a choice of [[spin structure]].

Now, every hook-shaped sub-[[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\hat G
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^n A
  }
$$

in the above is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]. By the [[universal property]] of the [[homotopy pullback]] this means that the "space" -- really: _[[homotopy type]]_ or just _[[type]]_, for short -- of lifts of a given map $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ to a map $X \to \mathbf{B}\hat G$ is equivalently the type of trivializations of the [[composition|composite]] $X \to \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to} \mathbf{B}^n A$. But this map modulates an $(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}A)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $P \to X$ and a trivialization of this map is equivalently a [[section]] of $P \to X$. Only if here $n = 1$ (and $A$ an ordinary 1-group) is this an ordinary bundle.

In particular for $o_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}SO(n)$ a given choice of [[orientation]] of an $n$-dimensional [[manifold]] $X$, a choice of [[Spin structure]] is a choice of section of the $(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2)$- [[principal 2-bundle]]

$$
  \mathbf{w}_2(o_X)^* {*} \to X
$$

which is sometimes called the "spin-lifting bundle gerbe". Hence spin structures are parts of fields in physics which are not sections of a field 1-bundle. Again, this is faithfully captured only in [[higher geometry]].


This is only the most famous phenomenon in a large class of similar structures of fields in field theory. Notably in higher dimensional [[supergravity]] and in [[string theory]] there are fields which are ever higher lifts through this [[Whitehead tower]] -- [[higher spin structures]], such as [[String structures]] and [[Fivebrane structures]] in the next two steps. Accordingly, these are fields which are equivalently sections of [[principal 3-bundles]] (the "[[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]") and [[principal infinity-bundle|principal 7-bundles]] (the "[[Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle]]").





#### Twisted and shifted fields

(...)

#### Higher gauge fields

Some fields considered in theoretical physics are sections of/connections on not an ordinary [[fiber bundle]], but a [[higher geometry|higher geometric]] fiber bundle: a [[fiber ∞-bundle]]. For instance the higher analog of the [[electromagnetic field]] which is called the _[[B-field]]_ or _[[Kalb-Ramond field]]_ is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|2-connection]] on a [[principal 2-bundle]]. There is no way to faithfully encode this as a section of any ordinary [[fiber bundle]]. It follows that for instance also the [magnetic charge anomaly](magnetic+charge#MagneticChargeAnomaly) (as discussed there) has no accurate description in terms of field bundles.

   Similarly, field in [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theoy]] are not, in general, sections of a field bundle.


#### Field $\infty$-bundles and moduli $\infty$-stacks of fields

By the [above](#IdeaOfFieldBundlesAndItsProblems), defining a physical field to be a section of some bundle goes in the right direction, but misses crucial aspects of physical fields. But it turns out that the problem is fixed simply by passing from traditional geometric bundles to bundles in [[higher geometry]].

Below in _[Definition](Definition)_ we discuss a natural unified formulation of the notion of physical field in terms of [[higher geometry]] and then we spell out many [Examples](#Examples).

## Definition

### Physical field
 {#DefinitionPhysicalField}

A notion of _field_ in physics is part of a specification of _[[theory (physics)|physical theory]]_ or _[[model (physics)|physical model]]_. We consider specifically the framework of [[prequantum field theory]]. Here a [[theory (physics)|theory]]/[[model (physics)|model]] is specified by (or at least comes with) an _[[action functional]]_. The _field_ content of the theory is part of the specification of the [[domain]] of the action functional. Therefore in def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} below we define _action functionals_ and the fields relative to this notion.

We work in the following context.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Context

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. For many of the examples below it is furthermore assumed that $\mathbf{H}$ is equipped with [[differential cohesion]]. This implies in particular that there is a notion of [[smooth manifold]] [[internalization|internal]] to $\mathbf{H}$.

Fix $\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ a [[group object in an (∞,1)-category|group object]] in $\mathbf{H}$, hence a cohesive [[∞-group]].

=--

For the main definition below we need the following basic notation.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $B \in \mathbf{H}$ any [[object]], and $X,A \in \mathbf{H}_{/B}$ two objects in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]], write

$$
  [X,A]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \coloneqq
  \underset{B}{\prod} [X,A]
  \in \mathbf{H}
$$

for the $\mathbf{H}$-valued [[hom object]] between $X$ and $A$: the [[dependent product]] over $B \to *$ of the [[internal hom]] $[X, A] \in \mathbf{H}_{/B}$.

=--

The following defines the notion of _[[action functional]]_ and as part of the data it defines the notion of _physical field_.

+-- {: .num_defn #FieldsInAnActionFunctional}
###### Definition

Given an [[object]] $\mathbf{BgFields} \in \mathbf{H}$ and 
given two objects, to be denoted $\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}  \in \mathbf{H}_{/B}$, in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos|slice]] over $\mathbf{BgFields}$,
then an **[[action functional]]** in ($\mathbf{H}, \mathbb{G})$ "on fields on $X$" is a [[morphism]]

$$
  S \;\colon\; [\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}} \to \mathbb{G}
  \,.
$$

In this context we say that

* the [[dependent sum]] $X \coloneqq \underset{\mathbf{BgField}}{\sum} \Phi_X$ is the **[[worldvolume]]** or **[[spacetime]]**;

* the morphism $\Phi_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{BgFields}$ is the **[[background field]]**;

* the object $\mathbf{Fields}$ is the **[[moduli ∞-stack]] of fields**;

* the [[elements]] of $[\Phi_X,\mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$, hence the morphims

  $$
    \phi \;\colon\; \Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields}
  $$

  in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$, hence the [[diagrams]]

  $$
    \array{
       X &&\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&& \underset{\mathbf{BgFields}}{\sum} \mathbf{Fields}
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\Phi_X}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{Fields}}}
       \\
       && \mathbf{BgFields}
    }
  $$

  in $\mathbf{H}$, are the **fields** on $X$;

* a **[[gauge transformation]]** is a [[homotopy]] in $[\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$, hence a

  $$
    \phi \Rightarrow \phi'
  $$

* a **[[higher gauge transformation]]** is a [[higher homotopy]] in $[\Phi_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}$.

###### Remark

The above says in particular that in [[higher geometry]] all fields are [[sigma-model]] fields: if we regard the [[moduli ∞-stack]] $\mathbf{Fields}$ as the [[target space]].

### Restriction and pullback of physical fields


+-- {: .num_remark #PullbackAlongGeneralizedLocalDiffeomorphisms}
###### Remark

Since by def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional} a physical field is a map $\phi \colon \Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields}$ in 
$\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$, it may be "pulled back" along maps  of [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $f \colon Y \to X$ when these are extended to maps $\Phi_Y \to \Phi_X$ in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{BgFields}}$ of the [[background fields]], hence to [[diagrams]] in $\mathbf{H}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    Y &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\Phi_Y}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\kappa}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{Phi_X}}
    \\
    && 
    \mathbf{BgFields}
  }
  \,,
$$

hence maps $f : X \to Y$ equipped with a choice of [[equivalence]] 

$$
  \kappa ;\colon\; f^*\Phi_X \simeq \Phi_Y 
$$

between the [[background fields]].

## Examples
 {#Examples}

We distinguish three broad classes of examples of fields as in def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional}:

1. [Force fields](#ForceFields)

   1. [Fields of gravity and generalized geometry](#FieldsOfGravityAndGeneralizedGeometry)

      In this case the [[background gauge field]] is a [[G-structure]], the [[moduli stack]] of fields is a [[delooping|delooped]] [[∞-group extension]] $\mathbf{B}\hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ and a field is a generalized [[vielbein]] exhibiting a [[reduction and lift of structure groups|reduction/lift of structure group]].

   1. [Gauge fields](#GaugeFields)

      In this case $\mathbf{Fields}$ is a [[moduli space]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ of [[connections on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]] on $G$-[[principal ∞-bundles]] for some [[gauge group]] $G \in Grpd(\mathbf{H})$.

1. [Matter fields](#MatterFields)

   In this case the [[background gauge field]] is a $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $P$ for some [[gauge group]] $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ and $\mathbf{Fields}$ is the univeral $\rho$-[[associated ∞-bundle]] $V//G \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ for $\rho$ an [[∞-action]] of $G$ on some $V \in \mathbf{H}$. A field is [[section]] of the [[associated ∞-bundle|associated]] $V$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]].

Not all examples fall squarely into one of these types, some are mixtures of these. In particular the moduli stacks $\mathbf{B}G$ here are typically all differentially refined to $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ so that for instance every [[reduction and lift of structure groups]] goes along with a corresponding data of the reduction of an [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connection]]. The archetypical example for this are [[spin connections]], see the example _[Ordinary gravity](#OrdinaryGravity)_ below.

### **I)** Force fields
 {#ForceFields}

The two classes of [[force]] fields are:

* [Fields of gravity and generalized geometry](#FieldsOfGravityAndGeneralizedGeometry);

* [Gauge fields](#GaugeFields).


#### **I a)** Fields of gravity and generalized geometry
 {#FieldsOfGravityAndGeneralizedGeometry}

Let 

$$
  A \to \hat G \to G
$$

be an [[∞-group extension]] in $\mathbf{H}$. Then a [[lift of the structure group]] from $G$ to $\hat G$ is typically interpreted as a field of [[gravity]] and its variants.

##### Ordinary gravity
 {#OrdinaryGravity}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let 

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}O(n)
   \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$

the [[delooping]] of the [[Lie group|Lie]]-[[subgroup]] inclusion of the [[orthogonal group]] into the [[general linear group]] in [[dimension]] $n$ (the inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]]).

For $X \in $ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow$ $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$, write

$$
  \Phi_X \coloneqq \tau_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$

for the canonical map modulating the $GL(n)$-[[principal bundle]] to which the [[tangent bundle]] is canonically [[associated bundle|associated]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #RiemannianVielbein}
###### Example

Morphisms

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \tau_X \to \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
$$

in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}$ hence [[diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}O(n)
    \\
    & \searrow &\swArrow_{e}& \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$ are equivalently [[vielbein]] fields $e$ exhibiting the [[reduction of the structure group]] from $GL(n)$ to $O(n)$. A [[gauge transformation]] is a local frame transformation. Hence 

$$
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[moduli stack]] of [[Riemannian metrics]] on $X$. Every such is a field configuration of ordinary [[gravity]] on $X$. (But see example \ref{GenerallyCovariantFieldOfGravity} below.)

According to 
remark \ref{PullbackAlongGeneralizedLocalDiffeomorphisms} such fields pull back along map $f \colon Y \to X$ that fit into a diagram

$$
  \array{
    Y &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\tau_Y}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\tau_X}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
  \,.
$$ 

These are precisely [[local diffeomorphisms]] and indeed these are precisely the maps along which [[vielbein]] fields / [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] fiedls pull back. (Pullback along [[smooth functions]] may not preserve the non-degeneracy of a metric tensor, but precisely the local diffeomorphisms do.)

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[smooth structure]] on $X$ as embodied by $\tau_X$ is the [[background field]] in example \ref{RiemannianVielbein}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n$ is the [[coset space]] $GL(n)//O(n)$, hence we have a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of [[moduli stacks]] of the form

$$
  GL(n)//O(n)
  \to
  \mathbf{B}O(n)
  \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$. This means that locally, over a [[cover]] ([[1-epimorphism]]) $p \colon U \to X$ over which the [[tangent bundle]] has a trivialization $\tau_X|_U \simeq *$, the space of fields is simply $[U, GL(n)//O(n)]$.

=--

The next example is the differential refinement of the previous one.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Let 

$$
  \widehat \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}
$$

be the canonical differential refinement of $\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n$, where now the [[moduli stacks]] of [[principal connections]] appear. For $X$ a manifold as above, let then

$$
  \hat \tau_X 
  \;\colon\;
  X 
  \to
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}
$$

modulate an [[affine connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]]. A field 

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \hat \tau_X \to \widehat \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
$$

is now still equivalently just a [[vielbein]], but its component

$$
  \underset{\mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}}{\sum} \hat \tau_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \to \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn}
$$

now captures the orthognal connection which in the physics literature is often called (inaccurately) the _[[spin connection]]_, denoted $\omega$. The [[vielbein]] then exhibits the original [[affine connection]] as that whose components are the [[Christoffel symbols]] $\Gamma$ of the [[Riemannian metric]] defined as above, a relation that is familiar from the physics literature in the form of the [[equation]]

$$
  \omega = e^{-1}\Gamma e + e^{-1} d e
$$

between local connection 1-form components.

=--

But both these examples do not fully accurately reflect the field content of [[gravity]] yet. This is because the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[gravity]] is supposed to by [[general covariance|generally covariant]]. This means that for two [[vielbein]] field configurations as in example \ref{RiemannianVielbein} such that one goes into the other under a [[diffeomorphism]] of [[spacetime]] $X$, there is a [[gauge transformation]] between them.

+-- {: .num_example #GenerallyCovariantFieldOfGravity}
###### Example

Write $\mathbf{Diff}(X) \coloneqq \mathbf{Aut}(X) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ for the [[diffeomorphism group]] of the [[smooth manifold]] $X$. There is then the canonical [[∞-action]] of the [[automorphism ∞-group]] $\mathbf{Diff}(X)$ on $X$ itself, exhibited by the universal [[associated ∞-bundle]]

$$
  \left(X // \mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right) \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right) \right)
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right)}
  \,.
$$

This induces also an [[∞-action]] also on the [[tangent bundle]].

Moreover the trivial bundle

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \coloneqq
  (\mathbf{Diff}(X)\times \mathbf{OrthStruc} \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}(X) )
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}(X)}
$$

corresponds to the trivial action.

Then

$$
  \underset{\mathbf{B}Diff(n)}{\sum}
  \underset{\mathbf{B}(GL(n))}{\prod} 
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{Fields}]
 \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the accurate space of [[general covariance|generally covariant]] fields of [[gravity]].

#### **I b)** Gauge fields
 {#GaugeFields}

The term _gauge field_ in _[[gauge theory]]_ with respect to a [[gauge group]] $G$ refers to fields which are modeled by [[connection on a bundle|connections]] either on $G$-[[principal bundles]] or on [[associated bundles]] for these. The notion of [[equivalence]] between two such fields (hence between [[connections on bundles]]) is the original meaning of the word _[[gauge transformation]]_, even though that term is also used for equivalences between fields which are not modeled by connections.

We discuss the general notion of gauge fields and then various special cases and variants. The following table gives an overview over the notions involved in the concept of gauge fields

[[!include gauge field - table]]

##### Electromagnetic field

[[electromagnetic field]]:

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
$$

##### Yang-Mills field

[[Yang-Mills field]]

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
$$


### **II)** Matter fields
 {#MatterFields}

[[matter]]

#### Fermions
 {#Fermions}

[[fermion]]:

$S$ a [[spin representation]]

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  S//Spin
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}Spin
$$

#### Tensor fields

While the term _physical field_ probably orignates from _[[tensor field]]_, few fields are fundamentally given by tensor fields. Nevertheless, tensor fields, being [[sections]] of a [[tensor product]] of copies of the [[tangent bundle]] and the [[cotangent bundle]] are certainly examples of the general notion of field as in def. \ref{FieldsInAnActionFunctional}. Gere we spell this out.

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], a [[tensor field]] of rank $(p,q)$ is a [[section]] of the [[tensor product]] bundle

$$
  \Gamma(T X)^{\otimes_{C^\infty(X)} p} \otimes_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)^{\otimes q}
  \,. 
$$

This is canonically the [[associated bundle]] to the $GL(n)$-[[principal bundle]] which to which the [[tangent bundle]] is also canonically associated, by the given [[representation]] of $GL(n)$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n(p+q)}$.

The [[universal associated ∞-bundle]] of this representation is 

$\mathbf{Fields} 
\;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n (p+q)}//GL(n) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) $.

Hence for $\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$ the canonical map, the space of $(p,q)$-tensor fields on $X$ is

$$
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \in
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

By passing to [[irreducible representations]] in the above, we obtain specifically the corresponding subclasses of tensor fields, such as [[differential forms]].



### **III)** Sigma-model fields

[[sigma-model]]

#### Particle

[[particle]]

$\mathbf{Fields} = $ [[spacetime]]

#### Charged particle

[[1d Chern-Simons theory]]

Let $T \hookrightarrow G$ be [[maximal torus]] which fixes a given 
[[weight (in representation theory)]] $\langle \lambda, -\rangle$ on compact simple and simply connected [[Lie group]] $G$. Let $\rho$ be the corresponding [[representation]] under the [[Borel-Weil-Bott theorem]].

Then the topological part of the [[sigma model]] for the [[particle]] charged under $(G,\rho)$ in some $G$-[[background gauge field]] has

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
  \to 
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//G
  \simeq
   \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
$$
