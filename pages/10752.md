## Idea

The term _highly structured spectrum_ refers to models for [[spectra]] by [[model categories]] which carry a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] (see there for more background). This includes [[orthogonal spectra]], [[symmetric spectra]] and [[S-modules]].

Similarly a _highly structured ring spectrum_ is a [[monoid]] in this context (a model for an [[A-infinity algebra]]/[[E-infinity algebra]]).

See at the following entries:

* [[orthogonal spectrum]], [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

* [[S-module]], [[model structure on S-modules]]
