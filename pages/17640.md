## Definition

A [[ring]] is (left) **coherent** if every [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] (left) [[ideal]] of this ring is [[finitely presented object|finitely presented]].   Equivalently, a ring is coherent if and only if it is a (left) [[coherent module]] over itself.

Every (left) [[noetherian ring]] is a coherent  ring.  

[Lombardi & Quitté 2015](#LombardiQuitte15) argue that coherent rings are more suited to [[constructive mathematics]] than noetherian rings.  This is probably connected to the importance of [[coherent sheaves]].
