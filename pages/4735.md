## Definition

For $G$ a [[Lie 3-group]], a _connection_ on a $G$-[[principal 3-bundle]] coming from a [[cocycle]] $g : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a lift of the cocycle to the  [[3-groupoid of Lie 3-algebra valued forms]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

## Examples

* [[11-dimensional supergravity]] can be understood as the theory of 3-connections with coefficients in the [[super L-infinity algebra]] called the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]. See [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]].
