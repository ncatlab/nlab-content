## Idea

_$E$-Theory_ is the name of a [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[C*-algebras]] and whose [[hom-sets]] are homotopy classes of slightly generalized $C*$-homomorphisms, called _[[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]]_. These hom-sets have the structure of an [[abelian group]] and are also called the _E-groups_ of their arguments. Since under [[Gelfand duality]] [[C*-algebras]] may be thought of as exhibiting [[noncommutative topology]], one also speaks of _[[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]]_.

This construction may be understood as the universal improvement of [[KK-theory]] under [[excision]] ([Higson 90](#Higson90)). Accordingly, the $E$-groups behave like groups of a [[K-theory]]-like [[generalized cohomology theory]].

In terms of [[noncommutative topology]] (regarding, in view of [[Gelfand duality]], noncommutative [[C*-algebras]] as [[algebras of functions]] on "noncommutative topological spaces") one may understand this as dealing with "locally badly behaved space" such as certain [[quotients]] of [[foliations]] ([Connes-Higson 90](ConnesHigson90))
in a way that resembles a noncommutative version of [[shape theory]] ([Dādārlat 94](#Dadarlat94)).

## Definition

First some notation and terminology.

For $A \in $ [[C*Alg]], we write

$$
  \Sigma A \coloneqq C_0((0,1),A)
$$

for the $C^\ast$-algebra of continuous $A$-valued functions on the open inverval [[vanishing at infinity]]. This is also called the _suspension_ of $A$.

For $A,B \in $ [[C*Alg]], write $[A,B]$ for the set of [[homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of [[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]]  $A \to B$. As discussed there

1. there is a natural [[composition operation]] $[A,B] \times [B,C] \to [A,C]$;

1. $[A,\Sigma B]$ is naturally an [[abelian group]].

Finally, write $\mathcal{K} \in $ [[C*Alg]] for the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]] on an infinite-dimensional [[separable Hilbert space]]. For $A \in C^\ast Alg$ the [[tensor product of C*-algebras]] $A \otimes \mathcal{K}$ is also called the _stabilization_ of $A$.

###### Definition

For $A,B \in $ [[C*Alg]], the **E-group** of $A$ with [[coefficients]] in $B$ is

$$
  E(A,B) \coloneqq [(\Sigma A )\otimes \mathcal{K}, (\Sigma B) \otimes \mathcal{K}]
  \in Ab
  \,.
$$

Under the induced [[composition]] operation this yields an [[additive category]] $E$ whose [[objects]] are [[C*-algebras]], and whose [[hom-objects]] are $E(-,-)$.

## Properties

### Universal characterization

E-theory is the [[universal construction|universal]] 
localization [[C*Alg]] $\to E$ which is homotopy-invariant, stable and preserves [[exact sequences]] in the middle.

(...)

### Relation to KK-theory
 {#RelationToKKTheory}

Because KK-theory is the universal _split exact_ (stable and homotopy-invariant) localization of [[C*Alg]], and E-theory the universal half-exact localization, and since every [[split exact sequence]] is in particular exact, there is a universal [[functor]] 

$$
  KK \to E
$$ 

from the [[KK-theory]] [[homotopy category]] to that of $E$-theory. 

Restricted to [[nuclear C*-algebras]] this is a [[full and faithful functor]]. ([Higson 90](#Higson90)) (...)

If in the definition of E-theory by [[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]] one restricts to those which take values in contractive [[completely positive maps]], then the results is isomorphic to KK-theory again. (K. Thomsen, [Introduction, p. 34](#Introduction)). The above universal functor $KK \to E$ is then just the corresponding [[forgetful functor]].

It follows that the Kasparov product in [[KK-theory]] is equivalently given by the composition of the corresponding completely positive [[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]].
