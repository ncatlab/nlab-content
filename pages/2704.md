Specht modules are some very nice $\mathbb{Z}[S_n]$ [[modules]] which are [[irreducible object|irreducible]] after [[base change]] to $\mathbb{Q}$.  Over a field of characteristic $p$, where $p \mid n!$, the base changes are not irreducible, but every irreducible module appears as the [[cosocle]] of a Specht module.
