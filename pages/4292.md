## Definition

A power series in a variable $X$ with coefficients in a [[ring]] $R$ is a formal [[series]] of the form

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n X^n
$$

with coefficients $(a_n \in R)_{n = 0}^\infty$. 

The collection of power series in variable $X$ with coefficients in $R$ is denoted $R [ [ X ] ]$.

If there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_n = 0 $ for all $n \gt k$ then this is a [[polynomial]] of degree $k$.


## Examples

### Taylor series

* [[Taylor series]]

### MacLaurin series

For $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ a [[smooth function]] on the [[real line]], and for $f^{(n)} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ denoting its $n$th [[derivative]] its [[MacLaurin series]] (its [[Taylor series]] at $0$) is the power series

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty  
   \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n
  \,.
$$

If this power series [[convergence|converges]] to $f$, then we say that $f$ is _[[analytic function|analytic]]_.
