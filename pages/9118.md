## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]/[[differential cohesion]] a _coreduced object_ is one all whose [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] paths are constant.
Compare the [[discrete object|discrete objects]], in which all paths are constant, meaning all discrete objects are also coreduced.

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
  \,,
$$

where $\Re$ and $\&$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $\Im$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

A **coreduced object** or **coreduced type** is one in the [[full subcategory]] defined by the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Im$ or equivalently the [[infinitesimal flat modality]] $\&$.

Note that an object $X$ being coreduced is the same as it being [[formally etale]].

## Examples

* A coreduced [[scheme]] is also called a [[de Rham space]]. The [[cohomology]] over such is [[crystalline cohomology]], the [[quasicoherent sheaves]] over these define [[D-geometry]].
* In a [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] setting, [[formally etale morphism|formally etale maps]] are the [[local diffeomorphism|local diffeomorphisms]], and the coreduced objects are those for which the terminal map $X \to 1$ is a local diffeomorphism.
