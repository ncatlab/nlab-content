## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]/[[differential cohesion]] a _coreduced object_ is one all whose [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] paths are constant. 

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv &#643;_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf}
  \,,
$$

where $\Re$ and $\flat_{inf}$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $&#643;_{inf}$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

A **coreduced object** or **coreduced type** is one in the [[full subcategory]] defined by the middle modality $&#643;_{inf}$. 

## Examples

* A coreduced [[scheme]] is also called a [[de Rham space]]. The [[cohomology]] over such is [[crystalline cohomology]], the [[quasicoherent sheaves]] over these define [[D-geometry]].
