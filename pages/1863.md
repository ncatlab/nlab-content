A functor is **cocontinuous** if it preserves small [[colimit|colimits]].

Note that $F: C \to D$ is coconintinuous if and only if the functor $F^{op}: C^{op} \to D^{op}$ between [[opposite categories]] is a [[continuous functor]].

An example of a dis-cocontinuous (or disco-continuous) functor is the forgetful functor $F : \text{Set}_* \rightarrow \text{Set}$ from the category of pointed sets to the category of sets.
