A [[functor]] is **cocontinuous** if it preserves [[small category|small]] [[colimit|colimits]].  Usually one only considers cocontinuous functors whose domain and codomain are [[cocomplete categories]] (have all small colimits).

Note that $F: C \to D$ is cocontinuous if and only if the functor $F^{op}: C^{op} \to D^{op}$ between [[opposite categories]] is a [[continuous functor]].

Not every functor is cocontinuous; an example of a dis-cocontinuous (or disco-continuous) functor is the forgetful functor $F : Set_* \rightarrow Set$ from the category of [[pointed sets]] to the category of [[sets]].

"Morally speaking," a functor is cocontinuous if and only if it is a [[left adjoint]] (or equivalently has a [[right adjoint]]).  Actually, only the 'if' part is true as stated; the 'only if' part has some conditions on it, given by the [[adjoint functor theorem]].
