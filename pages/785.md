## Idea 

A **homotopy pullback** is a special kind of [[homotopy limit]]: the appropriate notion of [[pullback]] in the context of [[homotopy theory]]. Homotopy pullbacks model the [[limit in quasi-categories|quasi-category pullbacks]] in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] that is [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by a given [[homotopical category]].  Since pullbacks are also called fiber products, homotopy pullbacks are also called **homotopy fiber products**.

A __homotopy pushout__ is the [[duality|dual]] concept.

For more details see [[homotopy limit]].


## Definition 

As with all homotopy limits, there is both a _local_ and a _global_ notion of homotopy pullback.

The _global_ definition says that the homotopy pullback of a [[co-span|cospan]] $X \to Z \leftarrow Y$ in a [[category with weak equivalences]] $C$ is its image under the right [[derived functor]] of the [[base change]] functor $pb: C^{\to \leftarrow} \to C$.

The _local_ definition says that the homotopy pullback of $X \to Z \leftarrow Y$ in a category with a notion of [[homotopy]] consists of a square
$$
  \array{
   P & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }
$$
that [[commutative square|commutes]] up to [[homotopy]], and such that for any other square
$$
  \array{
   T & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }
$$
that commutes up to homotopy, there exists a morphism $T\to P$, unique up to homotopy, making the two triangles commute up to homotopy, and similarly for homotopies and higher homotopies.  In other words, there is an equivalence
$$Map(T,P) \simeq HoSq(T,X\to Z\leftarrow Y)$$
between the space of maps $T\to P$ and the space of homotopy commutative squares with vertex $T$.

In good situations, such as when $X,Y,Z$ are [[fibrant object|fibrant]] in a [[model category]], the two constructions agree up to weak equivalence.

Note that in both cases, there is a canonical map from the actual pullback $X\times_Z Y$ to the homotopy pullback $X\times_Z^h Y$.  In the global case this comes by the definition of a derived functor; in the local case it comes because a commutative square is, in particular, a homotopy commutative one.


## Concrete construction

Suppose now that $Z$ has a [[path object]] $Z^I$ that represents homotopies into $Z$.  (For instance, this is often the case when $C$ is a [[closed monoidal homotopical category]] with an [[interval object]] $I$.)  Then we can consider the (ordinary) [[limit]]
$$
  \array{
     X \times_{Z}^h Y
     &\to&\to& \to& Y
     \\
     \downarrow
     &\searrow&&& 
     \downarrow
     \\
     \downarrow
     &
     &
     Z^I
     &\stackrel{d_1}{\to}&
     Z
     \\
     \downarrow
     &
     &
     \downarrow^{d_0}
     \\
     X
     &
     \to
     &
     Z
  }
  \,.
$$
or equivalently as the ordinary pullback
$$\array{X\times_Z^h Y & \to & Z^I\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow \\
  X\times Y & \to & Z\times Z.}
$$
In good situations, this will be a (local) homotopy pullback of $X \to Z \leftarrow Y$.  This is the case when $C = $ [[Top]] with its canonical [[interval object]] $[0,1]$ (the [[unit interval]]), and also in many [[model category|model categories]] (when $X,Y,Z$ are fibrant) and [[category of fibrant objects|categories of fibrant objects]].  

The canonical morphism $X \times_{Z} Y \to X \times_Z^h Y$ here is induced by the section $Z \to Z^I$.

The homotopy pullback constructed in this way is an example of a _strict homotopy limit_, as mentioned at [[homotopy limit]].  In such a case, one can say that an arbitrary homotopy-commutative square
$$
  \array{
   W & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }
$$
is a homotopy pullback square if the induced morphism from $W$ to the strict homotopy pullback is a [[weak equivalence]].

+-- {: .query}

To Stephen: Yes you were right. It worth noting that it is generally better to post such queries on the nForum as they can easily be lost when posted in the Lab. (This query box will be deleted after a short time, as it is no longer really needed except to say thanks!)

## Fiber sequences 

Of particular interest are consecutive homotopy pullbacks of point inclusions. These give rise to [[fiber sequence]]s and [[loop space object]]s.
