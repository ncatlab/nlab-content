**Pregroup grammar** is a mathematical model of natural language grammar introduced by Lambek, it is part of the [[categorial grammar]] tradition.

## Pregroups

As defined in [Lambek99](#Lambek99), [Lambek08](#Lambek08), a **pregroup** is a partially-ordered monoid $(P, \leq, \cdot, 1)$ --- i.e. a [[monoidal category]] which is also a [[partial order|poset]] ---  such that every object $t \in P$ has left- and right-adjoints $t^l, t^r \in P$.
Explicitly we have the following four axioms:

* $t^l \cdot t \leq 1, \quad t \cdot t^r \leq 1 \quad$ (contraction)
* $1 \leq t \cdot t^l, \quad 1 \leq t^r \cdot t \quad$ (expansion)

In other words, a pregroup is a [[rigid monoidal category]] which is [[thin category|thin]] and [[skeletal category|skeletal]].
Note that a commutative pregroup is simply a [[group]].
Here are a few variants of pregroups that appear in the literature, see [Coecke13](#Coecke13):

* If we relax the anti-symmetry axiom for posets, we get a **quasi-pregroup**,
* If we relax the two expansion axioms, we get a **protogroup**.

In [[linguistics|linguistic]] applications, one starts with a [[partial order|poset]] $B = \{ s, n, \dots \}$ of **basic types** (e.g. sentence and noun) and then takes the free pregroup $P_B$ generated by $B$.
For a basic type $b \in B$, iterated adjoints $\dots, b^{ll}, b^l, b, b^r, b^{rr}, \dots \in P_B$ are called **simple types**.
An arbitrary type $t \in P_B$ may then be given as a string of simple types.

The following lemma makes the parsing problem for free pregroups decidable --- i.e. given a sentence type $s \in P_B$ and the types for a string of words $t_0, \dots, t_n \in P_B$, is $t_0 \cdot \cdots \cdot t_n \leq s$?

**Switching lemma ([Lambek99](#Lambek99)):** For any pair of types $t, t' \in P_B$, if $t \leq t'$ then there is a type $t'' \in P_B$ such that $t \leq t''$ without expansions and $t'' \leq t'$ without contractions.
