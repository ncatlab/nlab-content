## Idea

There is an observation by [Ho&#345;ava--Witten 95](#HoravaWitten95), [Ho&#345;ava--Witten 96](#HoravaWitten96) which suggests that [[M-theory]] on an  [[cyclic group of order 2|Z/2]]-[[orbifold]] (actually a [[higher orientifold]]) of the form $X_{10} \times (S^1 \slash \mathbb{Z}_2))$ in "[[duality in string theory|dual]]" to [[heterotic string theory]] on its [[boundary]] ([[fixed point]]) "[[M9-brane]]". Therefore one also speaks of "heterotic [[M-theory]]" ([Ovrut 02](#Ovrut02)).

In the above the circle factor is taken to be the [[circle]] [[fiber]] over the 10d [[type IIA string theory|type IIA]] [[spacetime]]. 

If instead one considers another of the spatial dimensions to be compactified on $S^1\sslash \mathbb{Z}_2$, then, after [[T-duality]] ([[F-theory]]) result is supposed to be [[type I string theory]]. In this case the intersection of the [[M2-brane]] with the [[M9-brane]] (the latter now wrapping the M-theory circle fiber) is called the _[[E-string]]_.

More in detail:

One considers the [[KK-compactification]] of [[M-theory]] on a [[cyclic group of order 2|Z/2]]-[[orbifold]] of a [[torus]], hence of the [[Cartesian product]] of two [[circles]] 

$$  
  \array{
    & S^1_A &\times& S^1_B
    \\
    \text{radius}: &  R_{11} && R_{10}
  }
$$

such that the reduction on the first factor $S^1_A$ corresponds to the [[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]], hence so that subsequent [[T-duality]] along the second factor yields [[type IIA string theory]] (in its [[F-theory]]-incarnation). Now the diffeomorphism which exchanges the two circle factors and hence should be a symmetry of M-theory is interpreted as [[S-duality]] in [[type II string theory]]:

$$
  IIB \overset{S}{\leftrightarrow} IIB
$$

If one considers this situation additionally with a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-[[orbifold]] quotient of the first circle factor, one obtains the [[duality between M-theory and heterotic string theory]] ([[Horava-Witten theory]]). If instead one performs it on the second circle factor, one obtains [[type I string theory]].

Here in both cases the [[involution]] [[action]] is by [[reflection]] of the circle at a line through its center. Hence if we identify $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$ then the action is by multiplication by /1 on the [[real line]].

In summary:

M-theory on

* $(S^1_A \sslash \mathbb{Z}_2 ) \times S^1_B$ yields [[heterotic string theory]]

* $S^1_A \times \left( S^1_B \sslash \mathbb{Z}_2 \right)$ yields [[type I string theory]]

Hence the [[S-duality]] that swaps the two circle factors corresponds to _[[duality between type I and heterotic string theory]]_.

     HE 
       &\overset{KK/\mathbb{Z}^A_2}{\leftrightarrow}& 
     M

### Duality between M-theory and heterotic string theory

Here each of the two copies of the heterotic gauge theory is a "[[hidden sector]]" with respect to the other.

The orbifold equivariance condition of the [[supergravity C-field]] is that discussed at _[[orientifold]]_ (there for the [[B-field]]). Therefore it has to vanish at the two fixed fixed points of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action. Thereby the quantization condition

$$
  [2G_4] = 2 [c_2] - [\frac{1}{2} p_1]
$$ 

on the [[supergravity C-field]] becomes the condition for the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] of the [[heterotic string theory]] on the "boundary" (the orbifold fixed points).

## Properties

### Boundary conditions
 {#BoundaryConditions}

The [[supergravity C-field]] $\hat G_4$ is supposed to vanish, and _differentially_ vanish at the boundary in the HW model, meaning that also the local connection 3-form $C_3$ vanishes there. The argument is roughly as follows (similar for as in [Falkowski, section 3.1](#Falkowski)).


The [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory|higher Chern-Simons term]] 

$$
  C_3 \mapsto C_3 \wedge G_4 \wedge G_4
$$

in the [[Lagrangian]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] is supposed to be well-defined on fields on the [[orbifold]] and hence is to be $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant. 

Let $\iota_{11}$ be the canonical vector field along the circle factor. Then the component of $G \wedge G$ which is annihilated by the contraction $\iota_{11}$ is necessarily even, so the component $d x^{11}\wedge \iota_11 C_3$ is also even. It follows that also $d x^{11}\wedge \iota_11 G_4$ is even. 

Moreover, the kinetic term

$$
  C \mapsto G \wedge \star G
$$

is to be invariant. With the above this now implies that the components of $G$ annihiliated by $\iota_{11}$ is odd, because so is the mixed component of the [[metric]] tensor.

This finally implies that the restriction of $C_3$ to the orbifold fixed points has to be closed.
