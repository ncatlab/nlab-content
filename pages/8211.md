## Idea

In [[string theory]] a given [[Riemann surface]] with punctures can usually be read in different ways as describing either [[closed strings]] or [[open strings]]. For instance the [[disk]]-diagram describes equivalently a process where a closed string disappears, or a process where an open string first appears and then disappears.

Since closed string excitations induce [[gravity]] while open string excitations induce [[Yang-Mills fields]] as [[effective field theories]], this leads to a multitude of relations between these ordinary [[quantum field theories]], such as the [[KLT relations]] or the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].
