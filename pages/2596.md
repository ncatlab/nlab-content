A smooth real valued function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ on a smooth [[manifold]] $M$ is called a **Morse function** if every critical point of $f$ is regular, i.e. its Hessian matrix is nondegenerate. A choice of a Morse function on a compact manifold is often used to study topology of the manifold. This is called the Morse theory.
