A smooth real valued function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ on a smooth [[manifold]] $M$ is called a **Morse function** if every critical point of $f$ is regular. 

$p\in M$ is a **critical point** of $f$ if for any curve $\gamma : (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\to M$ with $\gamma(0)=p$, the vector

$$
\frac{d(f\circ\gamma)}{dt} |_{t=0} = 0.
$$

The critical point is **regular** if for one (or equivalently any) chart $\phi : U^{\open}\to \mathbb{R}^n$, where $p\in U$ and $\phi(p) = 0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, the **Hessian matrix**

$$\left(\frac{\partial^2 (f\circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial x^i\partial x^j}(0)\right)_{i,j=1,\ldots, n} $$

is a nondegenerate (i.e. maximal rank) matrix. 

A choice of a Morse function on a compact manifold is often used to study topology of the manifold. This is called the [[Morse theory]].  

Founders of Morse theory were M. Morse, R. Bott and A. Schwarz. 

One of the basic tools is [[Morse lemma]].
