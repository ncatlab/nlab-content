[[!redirects locally small abelian category]]

A __locally small abelian category__ is an abelian category which is [[well-powered category|well-powered]].
In other words, (equivalent classes of) [[subobject]]s of any set form a set. 

Remark. In older literature and occasionally in some contemporary literature in the subject of [[abelian categories]] locally small signifies what is now standardly called [[well-powered category]]. As every abelian category is a [[locally small category]] in the usual sense (all Homs are sets), the terminology locally small abelian category (if the modifier is understood as nontrivial) does not lead to ambiguities (hence it denotes a well-powered abelian category).
