
## Idea

In [[topology]], the "shrinking lemma" (lemma \ref{PatchesOfOpenCoverOfNormalSpaceMayBeMadeSmallerSoThatTheirClosuresAreContained}) below states that on a [[normal topological space]] the patches of every [[locally finite cover]] may be replaced by smaller patches which still cover the space, but such that their [[topological closures]] are contained in the original patches. 

If there is more than a [[countable set]] of elements in the original cover, then this conclusion requires [[Zorn's lemma]], hence the [[axiom of choice]].

The shrinking lemma is needed in the proof that [[ paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity]].

###### Lemma
**(shrinking lemma)**

Assuming [[excluded middle]] and the [[axiom of choice]] then:

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[normal topological space|normal]] and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[open cover]].

Then there exists another open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ such that the [[topological closure]] $Cl(V_i)$ of its elements is cotained in the original patches:

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\forall}
  \left(
     V_i \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$

We prove this in  increasing generality, for for binary open covers, then for finite covers, then for countable locally finite covers, and finally for general locally finite covers.

###### Lemma
**(shrinking lemma for binary covers)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]] and let $\{U \subset X\}_{i \in \{1,2\}}$ an [[open cover]] by two [[open subsets]].

Then there exists an open set $V_1 \subset X$ whose [[topological closure]] is contained in $U_1$

$$
  V_1 \subset Cl(V_1) \subset U_1
$$

and such that $\{V_1,U_2\}$ is still an open cover of $X$. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $U_1 \cup U_2 = X$ it follows (by [[de Morgan's law]]) that their [[complements]] $X \backslash U_i$ are [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[closed subsets]]. Hence by normality of $(X,\tau)$ there exist disjoint open subsets 

$$
  V_1 \supset X \backslash U_2
  \phantom{AAA}
  V_2 \supset X \backslash U_1
  \,.
$$

By their disjointness, we have the following inclusions:

$$
  V_1 \subset X \backslash V_2 \subset U_1
  \,.
$$

In particular, since $X \backslash V_2$ is closed, this means that $Cl(V_1) \subset X \backslash(V_2)$.

Hence it only remains to observe that $V_1 \cup U_2 = X$, by definition of $V_1$.

###### Lemma

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[normal topological space]], and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}$ be an [[open cover]] with a [[finite number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ of patches. Then there exists another open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ such that $Cl(V_i) \subset U_i$ for all $i \in I$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[induction]] using lemma \ref{ShrinkingLemmaForBinaryCover}.

To begin with, consider $\{ U_1, \underoverset{i = 2}{n}{\cup} U_i\}$. This is a binary open cover, and hence lemma \ref{ShrinkingLemmaForBinaryCover} gives an open subset $V_1 \subset X$ with $V_1 \subset Cl(V_1) \subset U_1$ such that $\{V_1, \underoverset{i = 2}{n}{\cup} U_i\}$ is still an open cover, and accordingly so is

$$
  \{ V_1  \} \cup \left\{ U_i \right\}_{i \in \{2, \cdots, n\}}
  \,.
$$

Similarly we next find an open subset $V_2 \subset X$ with $V_2 \subset Cl(V_2) \subset U_2$ and such that

$$
  \{ V_1, ,V_2  \} \cup \left\{ U_i \right\}_{i \in \{3, \cdots, n\}}
$$
 
is an open cover. After $n$ such steps we are left with an open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}$ as required.
