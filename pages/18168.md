
## Idea

In [[topology]], the "shrinking lemma" (lemma \ref{PatchesOfOpenCoverOfNormalSpaceMayBeMadeSmallerSoThatTheirClosuresAreContained}) below states that on a [[normal topological space]] the patches of every [[locally finite cover]] may be replaced by smaller patches which still cover the space, but such that their [[topological closures]] are contained in the original patches. 

If there is more than a [[countable set]] of elements in the original cover, then this conclusion requires [[Zorn's lemma]], hence the [[axiom of choice]].

The shrinking lemma is needed in the proof that [[ paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity]].

## Statement

+-- {: .num_lemma #PatchesOfOpenCoverOfNormalSpaceMayBeMadeSmallerSoThatTheirClosuresAreContained}
###### Lemma
**(shrinking lemma)**

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then:

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[normal topological space|normal]] and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]] [[open cover]].

Then there exists another open cover $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ such that the [[topological closure]] $Cl(V_i)$ of its elements is cotained in the original patches:

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\forall}
  \left(
     V_i \subset Cl(V_i) \subset U_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$
