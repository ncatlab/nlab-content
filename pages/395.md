#Idea#

A _category of fibrant objects_ is a [[category with weak equivalences]] equipped with extra structure somewhat weaker than that of a [[model category]]. 

The extra structure of fibrations _and_ cofibrations in a [[model category]] is, while convenient if it exists, not carried by many [[category with weak equivalences|categories with weak equivalences]] which still admit many constructions in [[homotopy theory]]. These are notably categories of [[presheaf|presheaves]] with values in a [[model category]]. 

A _category of fibrant objects_ is essentially like a [[model category]] but with all axioms concerning the cofibrations dropped, while at the same time assuming that all object are fibrant (hence the name). It turns out that this is sufficient for many useful constructions. In particular, it is sufficient for giving a convenient construction of the [[homotopy category]] in terms of [[span]]s of length one. This makes categories of fibrant objects useful in [[homotopical cohomology theory]].

###### Definition

A **category of fibrant objects** $C$ is 

* a [[category with weak equivalences]], i.e equipped with a subcategory
  $$
    Core(C) \hookrightarrow W \hookrightarrow C
  $$
  where $f \in Mor(W)$ is called a **weak equivalence**;

* equipped with a further subcategory 
  $$
    Core(C) \hookrightarrow F \hookrightarrow C
    \,,
  $$
  where $f \in Mor(F)$ is called a **fibration**

  Those morphisms which are both weak equivalences and fibrations are called **acyclic fibrations** .

This data has to satisfy the following properties:

* $C$ has finite [[product]]s;

* $C$ has a [[terminal object]] ${*}$;

* fibrations are preserved under [[pullback]];

* acyclic fibrations are preserved under [[pullback]];

* for every object there exists a [[path object]]

  * this means: for every object $B$ there exists at least one object denoted $B^I$ (not necessarily but possibly the [[internal hom]] with an [[interval object]]) that fits into a diagram
  $$
    (B \stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to} B \times B)
    =
    (B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} B^I \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} B \times B)
  $$
  where $s$ is a weak equivalence and $d_0 \times d_1$ is a fibration;

* all objects are _fibrant_, i.e. all morphisms $B \to {*}$ to the terminal object are fibrations.

#Examples#

* The tautological example is the [[full subcategory]] of any [[model category]] on all objects which are fibrant. 

  * this includes notably all models for categories of [[infinity-groupoid]]s:

    * the category of [[Kan complex]]es (a full [[subcategory]] of [[SSet]])

    * the category of [[strict omega-groupoid]]s using the [[model structure on strict omega-groupoids]]

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

[[nLab:Kan complex|Kan complexes]] form a [[nLab:category of fibrant objects|Brown category of fibrant objects]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[path object]] of any $X$ can be chosen to be the [[nLab:internal hom|internal hom]]

$$
  X^I = [\Delta^1, X]
$$

in with respect to the [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves|closed monoidal structure on]] [[SSet]] with the simplicial 1-[[simplex]] $\Delta^1$.

The stability of fibrations and acyclic fibrations
follows from the above fact that both are characterized
by a [[nLab:weak factorization system|right lifting property]] (as described a [[model structure on simplicial sets]]).

=--


  Concerning the example of [[Kan complex]]es, notice that [[SSet]] is also a _category of co-fibrant objects_ (i.e. $SSet^{op}$ is a category of fibrant objects) so that [[Kan complex]]es are in fact cofibrant and fibrant. That makes much of the technology discussed below superfluous, since it means that the right notion of $\infty$-morphism between Kan complexes is already the ordinary notion. 

  But then, often it is useful to model Kan complexes using the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], and then the second example becomes relevant, where no longer ever object is cofibrant.

* But the point then of the axioms of a category of fibrant objects is that when passing from [[infinity-groupoid]]s to [[infinity-stack]]s, i.e. to [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in [[infinity-groupoid]]s, the obvious na&iuml;ve way to lift the model structure from $\infty$-groupoids to sheaves of $\infty$-groupoids fails, as the required lifting axioms will be satisfied only locally (e.g. [[stalk]]wise).

  One can get around this by employing a more sophisticated [[model category]] structure as described at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], but often it is useful to use a more lightweight solution and consider sheaves with values in $\infty$-groupoids just as a category of fibrant objects, thereby effectively dispensing with the troublesome lifting property (as all mention of cofibrations is dropped):

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition ($\infty$-groupoid valued sheaves)

For $X$ a [[topological space]] let $SSh(X)$ be the full [[subcategory]] of 

* [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $X$ with values in the category [[SSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s 

* equivalently: [[simplicial object]]s in the [[category of sheaves]] on $X$

on sheaves $A$ for which each [[stalk]] $x^* A \in SSet$ is a [[Kan complex]].

Define a morphism $f : A \to B$ to be a fibration or a weakequivalence, if on each [[stalk]] $x^* f : x^* A \to x^* B$ is a fibration or weak equivalence, respectively of Kan complexes (in terms of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]).

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

$SSh(X)$ with this structure is a category of fibrant objects.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The terminal object ${*} = X$ is the sheaf constant on the 0-[[simplex]] $\Delta^0$, which represents the space $X$ itself as a sheaf. 

For every simplicial sheaf $A$ and every point $x \in X$ the [[stalk]] of the unique morphis $A \to {*}$ is $x^* A \to x^* {X}$, which is the unique morphism from the [[Kan complex]] $x^* A$ to $\Delta^0$. Since [[Kan complex]]es are fibrant, this is a [[Kan fibration]] for every $x \in X$. So every $A$ is a fibrant object by the above definition.

The fact that fibrations and acyclic fibrations
are preserved under pullback follows from the fact that
the [[stalk]] operation 

$$
  x^* : SSh(X) \to SSh(pt) \simeq SSet
$$

is the [[inverse image]] of a [[geometric morphism]]
and hence preserved finite [[limit]]s and in particular [[pullback]]s. So if $f : A \to B$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration in $SSh(X)$ and 

$$
  \array{
    A \times_B C &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow^{h^* f} && \downarrow^f
    \\
    C &\stackrel{h}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] diagram in $SSh(X)$, then for $x \in X$ any point of $X$ also

$$
  \array{
    x^*(A \times_{B} C) &\to& x^*B
    \\
    \downarrow^{x^* (h^* f)} && \downarrow^{x^* f}
    \\
    x^*C &\stackrel{x^*}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] diagram, now of [[Kan complex]]es. Since Kan complexes form a category of fibration objects, it follows that $x^* (h^* f)$ is a fiberation or acyclic fibration of Kan complexes, respectively. Since this holds for every $x$, it follows that $h^* f$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration, respectively.

Recall that a functorial choice of [[path object]] for a [[Kan complex]]e $K$ is the [[internal hom]] $[\Delta^1, K]$ with respect to the [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves|closed monoidal structure on]] [[simplicial set]]s:

$$
  K \stackrel{=}{\to} [\Delta^0, K]
  \stackrel{s_0}{\to}
  [\Delta^1, K]
  \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}
  [\Delta^0, K] \times [\Delta^0, K]
  \stackrel{=}{\to}
  K \times K
  \,,
$$

where $s_i$ and $d_i$ denote the [[simplicial set|degeneracy and face maps]], respectively.

For $A \in SSh(X)$ let $[\Delta^1,A]$ denote the sheaf
$$
  [\Delta^1,A] : U \mapsto [\Delta^1,A(U)]
  \,,
$$
where on the left we have new notation and on the right we have the [[internal hom]] in [[SSet]]. 

(This is really using the [[copower]]in of $SSh(X)$ over
[[SSet]]).

We want to claim that $[\Delta^1,A]$ is a [[path object]] for $A$.

To check that $[\Delta^1,A]$ is fibrant, let $x \in X$ be any point and consider the [[stalk]] $x^* [\Delta^1,A] \in SSet$. We compute laboriously

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    x^* [\Delta^1,A] &\simeq colim_{U \ni x} [\Delta^1,A(U)]
    \\
    &\simeq colim_{U \ni x} 
     SSet(\Delta^1 \times \Delta^\bullet, A(U))
    \\
    &\simeq 
      ([n] \mapsto colim_{U \ni x} 
     SSet(\Delta^1 \times \Delta^\n, A(U))
    \\
    & 
      ([n] \mapsto colim_{U \ni x} 
     \int_{[k] \in \Delta}
      Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), A(U)_k)
    \\
    & \simeq
      ([n] \mapsto      
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta}(   
        colim_{U \ni x} 
        Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), A(U)_k
      )
    \\
    &\simeq
      ([n] \mapsto      
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta}(   
       Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), 
       colim_{U \ni x} A(U)_k
      )  
    \\
    &\simeq
      ([n] \mapsto      
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta}(   
       Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), 
       (colim_{U \ni x} A(U))_k
      )  
    \\
    &\simeq
     [\Delta^1, colim_{U \ni x} A(U)]
    \\
    & \simeq
     [\Delta^1, x^* A]
)  
  \end{aligned}
$$

Where

* first step is the general formula for the [[stalk]];

* second step is the formula for the [[internal hom]] in the [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves|closed monoidal structure on simplicial sets]];

* third step is the fact that colimits of presheaves are computed objectwise (see examples at [[colimit]]);

* the fourth step is the definition of the 
  [[SSet]]-[[enriched functor category]] by an [[end]]

* the fifth step uses that the end truncates to a finite limit with $k \leq n$ and that the colimit is over a [[filtered category]] and that filtered colimits commute with finite limits;

* the sixth step uses that the set $\Delta([k],[1])\times \Delta([k],[n])$ is finite, hence a [[compact object]] to that the colimit can be taken into the hom;

* the seventh step uses again that colimits of presheaves are computed objectwise

* the remaining steps then just rewind the first ones, only that now $A(U)$ has been replaced by $colim_{U \ni x} A(U)$.

That the morphism $A \to [\Delta^1,A]$ is a weak equivalence and that $[\Delta^1,A] \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} A \times A$ is a fibration follows similarly by taking the [[stalk]] colimit inside to reduce to the statement that
$x^* A \to [\Delta^1,x^* A]$ is a weak equivalence and 
$[\Delta^1,x^* A] \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} x^*A \times x^* A$ is a fibration, using that $[\Delta^1,x^*A]$ is a [[path object]] for the [[Kan complex]] $x^* A$.



=--

The category of fibrant objects $SSh(X)$ 
is in fact the motivating example in [[BrownAHT]]. Notice that the [[homotopy category]] in question coincides with that using the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], so that the category of fibrant objects of stalk-wise Kan sheaves is a model for the homotopy category of [[infinity-stack]]s.



# Simple consequences of the definition #

Before looking at more sophisticated constructions, we record the following direct consequences of the definition.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The two projection maps $p_i : A_1 \times A_2 \to A_i$
out of a [[product]] are fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Because by assumption 
both morphisms $A_i \to {*}$ are fibrations
and fibrations are preserved under pullback

$$
  \array{
    A_1 \times A_2 &\to& A_2
    \\
    \;{}^{p_1}\downarrow^{\Rightarrow \in F} && \downarrow^{\in F}
    \\
    A_1 &\to&  {*}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The two morphisms $d_i : B^I \to B$ 
(whose product $d_0 \times d_1$, recall, is required to be
a fibration) are each separately acyclic fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the above lemma 
$d_i : B^I \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} B \times B
  \stackrel{p_i}{\to}$ is the composite of two fibrations
 and hence itself a fibration.

Moreover, from the diagram

$$
  \array{
    B 
    &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
    B^I 
    &\stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}&
    B \times B
    \\
    &&&\searrow^{d_i}& \downarrow^{p_i}
    \\
    & \searrow^{Id}&&& B
  }
$$

one reads of that the 2-out-of-3 
property for weak equivalences implies that $d_i$
is also a weak equivalence.

# Generalized universal bundles and 
the factorization lemma #

A central lemma in the theory of categories of fibrant objects is the factorization lemma

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma (factorization lemma)

For every morphism $f : C \to D$ in a category
$C$ of fibrant objects, there is an object 
$\mathbf{E}_f B$ such that $f$ factors as

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{E}_f B
    \\
    & {}^{\sigma_f}\nearrow && \searrow^{p_f}
    \\
    C &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& B
  }
$$

with

* $p_f$ a fibration

* $\sigma_f$ a weak equivalence that is a left [[inverse]]:
  $$
    Id_{\mathbf{E}_f B}
    =
    (
      \mathbf{E}_f B \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
      C \stackrel{\sigma_f}{\to}
      \mathbf{E}_f B
    )
    \,.
  $$

=--

**Remarks**

* This is the analog of the _factorization axiom_ in a [[model category]] which says that every map factors as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration.

* Notice that this in particular implies that every weak equivalence is given by a span of acyclic fibrations. In the context of [[Lie groupoid]] theory these are known as the [[Morita equivalence]]s between groupoids. (And groupoids indeed form a category of fibrant objects for instance with respect to the Brown-Golasinski [[folk model structure]]).


The way the proof of this lemma works, one sees that
this really arises in the wider context of computing
[[homotopy limit]]s in $C$. Therefore we split the
proof in two steps that are useful in their own right
and will be taken up in the next section on homotopy limits.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition 

For $f : C \to B$ a morphism, we say that 
the morphism $p_f : \mathbf{E}_f B \to B$
defined as the composite vertical morphism in the
[[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
   \mathbf{E}_f B &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}\gt& C
   \\
   \downarrow && \downarrow^f
   \\
   [\Delta^1,B] &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}& B
   \\
   \downarrow^{d_1}
   \\
   B
  }
$$
is the [[generalized universal bundle]] over $B$
relative to $f$.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The morphism $p_f : \mathbf{E}_f B \to B$ is
a fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The defining [[pullback]] diagram for $\mathbf{E}_f B$
can be refined to a double pullback diagram as follows

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{E}_f B 
     &\to& 
     C \times B 
     &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}& 
     C
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{f \times Id} && \downarrow^f
     \\
     B^I &\stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}&
     B \times B &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}&
     B
     \\
     \downarrow^{d_1} & \swarrow_{p_2}
     \\
     B
  }
  \,.
$$

Both squares are pullback suqares. Since
pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations, the morphism
$\mathbf{E}_f B  \to C \times B$ is a fibration.

By one of the lemmas above, also the projection map
$p_i : B \times B \to B$ is a fibration. 

The above diagram exibits $p_f$ as the the composite

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p_f &: \mathbf{E}_f B \to C \times B
    \stackrel{f \times Id}{\to}
    B \times B
    \stackrel{p_2}{\to}
    B
    \\
    & =
    \mathbf{E}_f B \to C \times B
    \stackrel{p_2}{\to}
    B 
  \end{aligned}
$$

of two fibrations. Therefore it is itself a fibration.

The morphism $\mathbf{E}_f B \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} C$

The [[section]] is the morphism induced via the

#More sophisticated consequences of the definition#

Using the factorization lemma, one obtaines the following
further useful statements about categories of fibrant
objects:

if they are not at the same time fibrations,
are not required by the axioms to be preserved by 
[[pullback]]. But it follows from the axioms that

# Homotopy fiber product #

Using the existence of [[path object|path space objects]] one can construct specific [[homotopy pullback]]s
called  _homotopy fiber products_ .


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A **homtopy fiber product** 
or **homotopy pullback** of two morphisms

$$
  A \stackrel{u}{\to} C \stackrel{v}{\leftarrow} B
$$

in a category of fibrant objects
is the object $A \times_C C^I \times_C B$  defined as the 
(ordinary) [[nLab:limit|limit]]

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C C^I \times_C B &&&\to & B

    \\
    \downarrow &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to & C    
  }
  \,.
$$

**Remark** This essentially says that $A \times_C C^I \times_C B$ is the 
universal object that makes the diagram
$$
  \array{
     A \times_C C^I \times_C B &\to& B
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     A &\to& C
  }

commute up to [[homotopy]] 
(see the section on homotopies for more on that).

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma


The projection

$$
 A \times_C C^I \times_C B \to A
$$
out of a homotopy fiber product is a fibrations. If $v$ is 
a weak equivalence, then this is an acyclic fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One may compute this [[nLab:limit]] in terms of two consecutive 
[[nLab:pullback|pullback]]s in two different ways.

On the one hand we have

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C C^I \times_C B &\to& \mathbf{E}_v C &\to & B
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    & &C^I & \stackrel{d_0}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to & C    
  }
$$

where every square is a pullback. 

By the above lemma on generalized universal bundles,
the map $\mathbf{E}_v C \to C$ is a fibration. The first
claim follows then since fibrations are stable under pullback.

On the other hand we have 

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C C^I \times_C B &\to& && B
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{E}_u C & \to &C^I & \stackrel{d_0}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow 
    &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to & C    
  }
$$

This now implies that the map $\mathbf{E}_u C \to C$ is a fibration.
By on of the above propositions weak equivalences
are stable under pullback along fibrations, hence the pullback
of $v$ is a weak equivalence.

for some [[path space object]] $B^I$ of $I$

**Proposition**

For $ u : B \to C$ a morphism and $B^I$, $C^I$ choices of path objects,
there is always another path object $B^{I'}$ that is weakly equivalent
to $B^I$ in that

  B

  \downarrow^{=}
  \\
  B 
  &\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&
  B^{I}
  &\stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}&
  B \times B

such that this fits into a span of morphism of path objects lifting $u : B \to C$

$$

    B &\stackrel{=}{\leftarrow}& B &\stackrel{u}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow^\sigma && \downarrow^{\sigma'} && \downarrow^{\sigma_C}

    \downarrow^{d_0 \times d_1} && \downarrow^{d'_0 \times d'_1} && \downarrow
    \\
    B \times B &\stackrel{u \times u}{\to}&
  }
$$

**Proof**

Apply the factorization lemma to

$$
  \array{
    B &\stackrel{u}{\to}& C &\stackrel{\sigma_C}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow^{\sigma} && \downarrow^{d_0 \times d_1}

    B^I &\stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}& B \times B
    &\stackrel{u \times u}{\to}& C \times C

**Proposition**

Homotopy is preserved under pre- and postcomposition with a given morphism.

More precisely,
let $f, g : B \to C$ be two homotopic morphisms. Then 

* for every morphisms $A \to B$ and $C \to D$ the composites
$A \to B \stackrel{f}{\to} C \to D$ and $A \to B \stackrel{g}{\to} C \to D$
are still homotopic.

* moreover, the homotopy may be realized with every given choice of   
  [[nLab:path object|path space object]] $D^I$ for $D$.


**Proof**

We decompose this into two statements:

1. for any $A \to B$ the morphisms $A \to B \stackrel{f,g}{\to} B$ are homotopic.

1. for any $C \to D$ and choice $D^I$ of path object there is an acyclic fibration
   $
     B' \to B
   $
   such that 
   $B' \to B \stackrel{f}{\to} C \to D$ is homotopic to
   $B' \to B \stackrel{g}{\to} C \to D$
   by a homotopy $\eta : B' \to D^I$.
   
The first of these follows trivially.

The second one follows by using the weak functoriality property of path objects
from above.

###### Definition

For $C$ a category of fibrant objects the category
$\pi C$ is defined to be the category

* with the same objects as $C$;

* with [[hom-set]]s the set of equivalence classes
  $$
   \pi C(A,B) := C(A,B)/_\sim
  $$
  under the above equivalence relation.

* Composition in $\pi C$ is given by composition of
  representatives in $C$.

###### Definition

The obvious functor

$$
  C \to \pi C
$$

is the identity on objects and the projection to
[[equivalence relation|equivalence classes]] on
[[hom-set]].

Let $\pi W \subset Mor(\pi C)$ be the image of the 
weak equivalences of $C$ in $\pi C$ under this functor,
and $\pi F$ the image of the fibrations.

###### Theorem

The weak equivalences in $\pi C$ form  a left multiplicative system.

=--


##Proof##

We need to show that for every diagram

$$
  \array{
    && B
    \\
    && \downarrow^{w \in W}
    \\
    A &\to& C  
  }
$$

$\in \pi C$

there is a commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    A' &\to & B
    \\
    \downarrow^{w' \in W} && \downarrow^{w \in W}
    \\
    A &\to& C  
  }
  \,.
$$

We accomplish this by letting $A' := A \time_C C^I \times_C B$ be the homotopy fiber product
in $C$ of a representative of the pullback diagram. The above
lemma implies then that $A' \o A$ is a weak equivalence.


The following proposition says that, while there need not be 
a functorial choice of path object
$$
  (-)^I : C \to C
$$
in a general category of fibrant objects, whatever choice one makes
is always _weakly_ functorial.




# The homotopy category #

We discuss now 
that the structure of a category of fibrant objects on a 
[[homotopical category]] $C$ induces 

* a related category $\pi C$ 

* with a morphism $C \to \pi C$

  * that is the identity on objects, 
  
  * and induces on $\pi C$ a notion of weak equivalences
    $$
      \pi W \subset Mor(\pi C)
    $$
    and fibrations
    $$
      \pi F \subset Mor(\pi C)
    $$

* such that

  * the weak equivalences in $\pi C$ form a [[calculus of fractions|left multiplicative system]] .

This implies the following convenient construction
of the [[homotopy category]] of $C$:

+-- {: .un}
###### Theorem

For $C$ a category of fibrant objects, 
its [[homotopy category]] is 
([[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to) the category
$Ho_C$ with

* the same objects as $C$;

* the [[hom-set]] $Ho_C(A,B)$ for all $A, B \in Obj(C)$
  given naturally by
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      Ho_C(A,B) 
      & \simeq 
      colim_{\hat A \stackrel{w\in \pi W}{\to} A}
      \pi C (\hat A,B)
      \\
      & =
      colim_{\hat A \stackrel{f\in \pi W\cap F}{\to} A}
      \pi C (\hat A,B)      
    \end{aligned}
    \,.
  $$

=--

Here the colimit is, as described at [[calculus of fractions|multiplicative system]], over the [[opposite category]] of the category $\pi W_A$ or $(\pi F\cap \pi W)_A$ 
whose objects are weak equivalences $\hat A \stackrel{w \in \pi W}{\to} A$ or acyclic fibrations
$\hat A \stackrel{f \in \pi W\cap F}{\to} A$ in $\pi C$, and whose morphisms are commuting triangles

$$
  \array{
    \hat A &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& \hat A'
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &&
    A
  }
$$
in $\pi C$ (i.e. for arbitrary $h$).

So more in detail the above colimit is over the functor

$$
  \pi C(-, B)_A : 
  (\pi W_A)^{op} \to (\pi C)^{op} 
  \stackrel{\pi C(-, B)}{\to}
  Set
  \,,
$$

where the first functor is the obvious forgetful functor.

**Remark**

It is again the factorization lemma above (and using 2-out-of-3 that implies that inverting just the acyclic fibrations in $C$ is already equivalent to inverting all weak equivalences. This means that the above theorem remains valid if the weak equivalences $t : A' \to A$ are replaced by _acyclic fibrations_.

Using acyclic fibrations here has the advantage that these are preserved under [[pullback]]. This allows to consistently compose spans whose left leg is an acyclic fibration by [[pullback]]. See [[homotopical cohomology theory]] and [[anafunctor]].

A discussion of this point of using weak equivalences versus acyclic fibrations in the construction of the homotopy category is also in Jardine: [Cocycle categories](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0782/).



We now provide the missing definitions and then the proof
of this theorem.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The weak equivalences $\pi W$ in $\pi C$ form
a [[calculus of fractions|left multiplicative system]].

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The homotopy categories of $C$ and $\pi C$ coincide:

$$
  Ho_C \simeq Ho_{\pi C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By one of the lemmas above, the morphisms
$d_i : B^I \to B$ are weak equivalences
and become [[isomorphism]]s in $Ho_C$.
The [[section]] $\sigma : B \to B^I$
then becomes an [[inverse]] for both 
of them, hence the images of $d_0$ and
$d_1$ in $Ho_C$ coincide. Therefore
the above diagram says that homotopic morphisms
in $C$ become equal in $Ho_C$.

But this means that the localization morphism
$$
  Q_C : C \to Ho_C
$$
factors through $\pi C$ as

$$
  Q_C : C \to \pi C \stackrel{Q_{\pi C}}{\to} Ho_C
$$

where $Q_{\pi C}$ sends weak equivalences in $\pi C$
to isomorphisms in $Ho_C$.

The universal property of $Q$ then implies the universal
property for $Q_{\pi C}$

$$
  \array{
    C &\to& \pi C &\to & A
    \\
    \downarrow^{Q_C} & \swarrow^{Q_{\pi C}} && \swarrow
    \\
    Ho_C
  }
  \,.
$$

=--



The above theorem on the description of $Ho_C$
now follows from the general formula for
[[localization]] at a 
[[calculus of fractions|left multiplicative system]]
of weak equivalences.

# Pointed category of fibrant objects #

If the category $C$ of fibrant objects has an initial object which _coincides_ with the terminal object $e$, i.e. a [[zero object]], then $C$ is a [[pointed category]]. In this case we have the following additional concepts and structures.

## Fibers ##

 For $p : Y \to X$ a fibration, the pullback $F$ in

$$
  \array{
     F &\stackrel{i}{\to}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     e &\to& X
  }
$$

is the **fibre** of $p$ and $i$ is the _fibre inclusion_.
(This is the _kernel_ of the morphism $f$ of [[pointed object]]s)


## [[fibration sequence|Fibration sequences]] ##

For $B$ any object and $B^I$ any of its [[path object]]s, the fiber of $B^I \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} B \times B$ is the **[[loop space object|loop object]]** $\Omega^{(I)} B$ of $B$ with respect to the chosen path object. This construction becomes independent up to canonical isomorphism of the chosen path space after mapping to the [[homotopy category]] and hence there is a functor

$$
  \Omega : Ho_C \to Ho_C
$$

which sends any object $B$ of $C$ to its canonical loop object $\Omega B$.

Any loop object $\Omega B$ becomes a group object in $Ho_C$, i.e. a group [[internalization|internal to]] $Ho_C$ in a natural way.



# Application in cohomology theory #

When the catgegory of fibrant objects is that of locally Kan simplicial sheaves, the [[hom-set]]s of its 
[[homotopy category]] compute generalized notions of [[cohomology]].

At [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] is a detailed discussion of how the ordinary notion of sheaf cohomology arises as a special case of that.
