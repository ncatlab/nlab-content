#Idea#

A _category of fibrant objects_ is a [[category with weak equivalences]] equipped with extra structure somewhat weaker than that of a [[model category]]. 

The extra structure of fibrations _and_ cofibrations in a [[model category]] is, while convenient if it exists, not carried by many [[category with weak equivalences|categories with weak equivalences]] which still admit many constructions in [[homotopy theory]]. These are notably categories of [[presheaf|presheaves]] with values in a [[model category]]. 

A _category of fibrant objects_ is essentially like a [[model category]] but with all axioms concerning the cofibrations dropped, while at the same time assuming that all object are fibrant (hence the name). It turns out that this is sufficient for many useful constructions. In particular, it is sufficient for giving a convenient construction of the [[homotopy category]] in terms of [[span]]s of length one. This makes categories of fibrant objects useful in [[homotopical cohomology theory]].

###### Definition

A **category of fibrant objects** $\mathbf{C}$ is 

* a [[category with weak equivalences]], i.e equipped with a subcategory
  $$
    Core(\mathbf{C}) \hookrightarrow W \hookrightarrow C
  $$
  where $f \in Mor(W)$ is called a **weak equivalence**;

* equipped with a further subcategory 
  $$
    Core(\mathbf{C}) \hookrightarrow F \hookrightarrow C
    \,,
  $$
  where $f \in Mor(F)$ is called a **fibration**

  Those morphisms which are both weak equivalences and fibrations are called **acyclic fibrations** .

This data has to satisfy the following properties:

* $C$ has finite [[product]]s;

* $C$ has a [[terminal object]] ${*}$;

* fibrations are preserved under [[pullback]];

* acyclic fibrations are preserved under [[pullback]];

* weak equivalences satisfy [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]]

* for every object there exists a [[path object]]

  * this means: for every object $B$ there exists at least one object denoted $B^I$ (not necessarily but possibly the [[internal hom]] with an [[interval object]]) that fits into a diagram
  $$
    (B \stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to} B \times B)
    =
    (B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} B^I \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} B \times B)
  $$
  where $s$ is a weak equivalence and $d_0 \times d_1$ is a fibration;

* all objects are _fibrant_, i.e. all morphisms $B \to {*}$ to the terminal object are fibrations.

#Examples#

## full subcategories of model categories ##

The tautological example is the [[full subcategory]] of any [[model category]] on all objects which are fibrant. 

## $\infty$--groupoids ##

This includes notably all models for categories of [[infinity-groupoid]]s:

  * the category of [[Kan complex]]es (a full [[subcategory]] of [[SSet]])

  * the category of [[strict omega-groupoid]]s using the [[model structure on strict omega-groupoids]]

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

[[nLab:Kan complex|Kan complexes]] form a [[nLab:category of fibrant objects|Brown category of fibrant objects]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[path object]] of any $X$ can be chosen to be the [[nLab:internal hom|internal hom]]

$$
  X^I = [\Delta^1, X]
$$

in with respect to the [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves|closed monoidal structure on]] [[SSet]] with the simplicial 1-[[simplex]] $\Delta^1$.

The morphism $X \to X^I$ is given by the [[simplex category|degeneracy map]] $\sigma_0 : \Delta^0 \to \Delta^1$ as
$$
  X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  [\Delta^0, X]
  \stackrel{[\sigma_0, X]}{\to}
  [\Delta^1, X]
  \,.
$$
This is indeed a weak equivalence, since by the [[simplicial identities]] it is a [[section]] (a [[inverse|right inverse]]) for the morphism
$$
  [\Delta^1, X] \stackrel{[\delta_0,X]}{\to}
  [\Delta^0, X]
  \,.
$$
This map, one checks, has the 
[[weak factorization system|right lifting property]] 
with respect to all [[boundary of a simplex]]-inclusions
$\partial \Delta^n \to \Delta^n$. By a lemma discussed
at [[Kan fibration]] this means that $[\delta_0,X]$
is an acyclic fibration. Hence $[\sigma_0, X]$, being
its right [[inverse]], is a weak equivalence.

The remaining morphism of the [[path object|path space object]] $X^I \to X \times X$ is
$$
  [\Delta^1, X]
  \stackrel{[\delta_0 \sqcup \delta_1, X]}{\to}
  [\Delta^0 \sqcup \Delta^0, X]
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  X \times X
  \,.
$$
One checks that this is indeed a [[Kan fibration]].

The stability of fibrations and acyclic fibrations
follows from the above fact that both are characterized
by a [[nLab:weak factorization system|right lifting property]] (as described a [[model structure on simplicial sets]]).

See for instance [section 1](http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/papers/g/goerss-jardine/ch-1.dvi) of 

* Goerss, Jardine, _Simplicial homotopy theory_ .

=--


  Concerning the example of [[Kan complex]]es, notice that [[SSet]] is also a _category of co-fibrant objects_ (i.e. $SSet^{op}$ is a category of fibrant objects) so that [[Kan complex]]es are in fact cofibrant and fibrant. That makes much of the technology discussed below superfluous, since it means that the right notion of $\infty$-morphism between Kan complexes is already the ordinary notion. 

  But then, often it is useful to model Kan complexes using the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], and then the second example becomes relevant, where no longer ever object is cofibrant.

## simplicial sheaves ##

The point of the axioms of a category of fibrant objects is that when passing from [[infinity-groupoid]]s to [[infinity-stack]]s, i.e. to [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in [[infinity-groupoid]]s, the obvious na&iuml;ve way to lift the model structure from $\infty$-groupoids to sheaves of $\infty$-groupoids fails, as the required lifting axioms will be satisfied only locally (e.g. [[stalk]]wise).

 One can get around this by employing a more sophisticated [[model category]] structure as described at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], but often it is useful to use a more lightweight solution and consider sheaves with values in $\infty$-groupoids just as a category of fibrant objects, thereby effectively dispensing with the troublesome lifting property (as all mention of cofibrations is dropped):


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition ($\infty$-groupoid valued sheaves)

For $X$ a [[topological space]] let $\mathbf{C} = SSh(X)$ be the full [[subcategory]] of 

* [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $X$ with values in the category [[SSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s 

* equivalently: [[simplicial object]]s in the [[category of sheaves]] on $X$

on sheaves $A$ for which each [[stalk]] $x^* A \in SSet$ is a [[Kan complex]].

Define a morphism $f : A \to B$ to be a fibration or a weak equivalence, if on each [[stalk]] $x^* f : x^* A \to x^* B$ is a fibration or weak equivalence, respectively, of Kan complexes (in terms of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]).

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

$SSh(X)$ with this structure is a category of fibrant objects.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The terminal object ${*} = X$ is the sheaf constant on the 0-[[simplex]] $\Delta^0$, which represents the space $X$ itself as a sheaf. 

For every simplicial sheaf $A$ and every point $x \in X$ the [[stalk]] of the unique morphism $A \to {*}$ is $x^* A \to x^* {X}$, which is the unique morphism from the [[Kan complex]] $x^* A$ to $\Delta^0$. Since [[Kan complex]]es are fibrant, this is a [[Kan fibration]] for every $x \in X$. So every $A$ is a fibrant object by the above definition.

The fact that fibrations and acyclic fibrations
are preserved under pullback follows from the fact that
the [[stalk]] operation 

$$
  x^* : SSh(X) \to SSh(pt) \simeq SSet
$$

is the [[inverse image]] of a [[geometric morphism]]
and hence preserves finite [[limit]]s and in particular [[pullback]]s. So if $f : A \to B$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration in $SSh(X)$ and 

$$
  \array{
    A \times_B C &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow^{h^* f} && \downarrow^f
    \\
    C &\stackrel{h}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] diagram in $SSh(X)$, then for $x \in X$ any point of $X$ also

$$
  \array{
    x^*(A \times_{B} C) &\to& x^*B
    \\
    \downarrow^{x^* (h^* f)} && \downarrow^{x^* f}
    \\
    x^*C &\stackrel{x^*}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] diagram, now of [[Kan complex]]es. Since Kan complexes form a category of fibrant objects, 
by the above, it follows that $x^* (h^* f)$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration of Kan complexes, respectively. Since this holds for every $x$, it follows that $h^* f$ is a fibration or acyclic fibration, respectively, in $SSh(X)$.

Recall that a functorial choice of [[path object]] for a [[Kan complex]]e $K$ is the [[internal hom]] $[\Delta^1, K]$ with respect to the [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves|closed monoidal structure on]] [[simplicial set]]s:

$$
  K \stackrel{=}{\to} [\Delta^0, K]
  \stackrel{s_0}{\to}
  [\Delta^1, K]
  \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}
  [\Delta^0, K] \times [\Delta^0, K]
  \stackrel{=}{\to}
  K \times K
  \,,
$$

where $s_i$ and $d_i$ denote the [[simplicial set|degeneracy and face maps]], respectively.

For $A \in SSh(X)$ let $[\Delta^1,A]$ denote the sheaf
$$
  [\Delta^1,A] : U \mapsto [\Delta^1,A(U)]
  \,,
$$
where on the left we have new notation and on the right we have the [[internal hom]] in [[SSet]]. 

(The notation on the left defines the way in which $SSh(X)$ is [[copower]]ered  over [[SSet]]).

We want to claim that $[\Delta^1,A]$ is a [[path object]] for $A$.

To check that $[\Delta^1,A]$ is fibrant, let $x \in X$ be any point and consider the [[stalk]] $x^* [\Delta^1,A] \in SSet$. We compute laboriously

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    x^* [\Delta^1,A] &\simeq colim_{U \ni x} [\Delta^1,A(U)]
    \\
    &\simeq colim_{U \ni x} 
     SSet(\Delta^1 \times \Delta^\bullet, A(U))
    \\
    &\simeq 
      ([n] \mapsto colim_{U \ni x} 
     SSet(\Delta^1 \times \Delta^\n, A(U))
    \\
    & 
    \simeq  ([n] \mapsto colim_{U \ni x} 
     \int_{[k] \in \Delta}
      Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), A(U)_k)
    \\
    & \simeq
      ([n] \mapsto      
      \int_{[k \leq n+1] \in \Delta}(   
        colim_{U \ni x} 
        Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), A(U)_k
      )
    \\
    &\simeq
      ([n] \mapsto      
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta|_{n+1}}(   
       Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), 
       colim_{U \ni x} A(U)_k
      )  
    \\
    &\simeq
      ([n] \mapsto      
      \int_{[k] \in \Delta|_{n+1}}(   
       Set(\Delta([k],[1])\times\Delta([k],[n]), 
       (colim_{U \ni x} A(U))_k
      )  
    \\
    &\simeq
     [\Delta^1, colim_{U \ni x} A(U)]
    \\
    & \simeq
     [\Delta^1, x^* A]
)  
  \end{aligned}
$$

Where the

* first step is the general formula for the [[stalk]];

* second step is the formula for the [[internal hom]] in the [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves|closed monoidal structure on simplicial sets]];

* third step is the fact that colimits of presheaves are computed objectwise (see examples at [[colimit]]);

* the fourth step is the definition of the 
  [[SSet]]-[[enriched functor category]] by an [[end]]

* the fifth step uses that 

  * the end truncates to a finite limit with $k \leq n+1$ since $\Delta^1 \times \Delta^n$ is $(n+1)$-[[simplicial skeleton|skeletal]]

  * and that the colimit is over a [[filtered category]] 

  * and that filtered colimits commute with finite limits;

* the sixth step uses that the set $\Delta([k],[1])\times \Delta([k],[n])$ is finite, hence a [[compact object]] so that the colimit can be taken into the hom;

* the seventh step uses again that colimits of presheaves are computed objectwise

* the remaining steps then just rewind the first ones, only that now $A(U)$ has been replaced by $colim_{U \ni x} A(U)$.

That the morphism $A \to [\Delta^1,A]$ is a weak equivalence and that $[\Delta^1,A] \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} A \times A$ is a fibration follows similarly by taking the [[stalk]] colimit inside to reduce to the statement that
$x^* A \to [\Delta^1,x^* A]$ is a weak equivalence and 
$[\Delta^1,x^* A] \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} x^*A \times x^* A$ is a fibration, using that $[\Delta^1,x^*A]$ is a [[path object]] for the [[Kan complex]] $x^* A$.



=--

The category of fibrant objects $SSh(X)$ 
is in fact the motivating example in [[BrownAHT]]. Notice that the [[homotopy category]] in question coincides with that using the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], so that the category of fibrant objects of stalk-wise Kan sheaves is a model for the homotopy category of [[infinity-stack]]s.


**Example**

Let $G$ be a topogical [[group]] and recall that
$\mathbf{B} G$ denotes the corresponding one-object
[[groupoid]].

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and
$U$ an open subset, let $C(U, G) \in Set$
be the set of continuous maps from $U$ into
$G$. This set naturally is itself a group, so
that to each $U \subset X$ we may associuate the
one-object groupoid 
$$
  U \mapsto \mathbf{B} C(U,G)
  \,.
$$
By postcomposition this with the [[nerve]] operation
we ontain an assignment of [[Kan complex]]es to
open subsets:

$$
  U \mapto N \mathbf{B} C(U,G) 
  \,.
$$

In degree 0 this is the constant [[sheaf]]

$$
  (N \mathbf{B}(-,G))_0 : U \mapsto {*}  
$$

while in degree 1 this is the [[sheaf]] of $G$-valued functions

$$
  (N \mathbf{B}(-,G))_1 : U \mapsto C(U,G)  
  \,.
$$

When the context is understood, we will just
write $\mathbf{B}G$ again for this $\infty$-groupoid
valued sheaf

$$
  \mathbf{B}G := N \mathbf{B} C(-,G)
  \,.
$$



## cats of fib objects from cats of fib objects ##

The following constructions produce new categories
of fibrant objects from the data provided from a given one.

Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a category of fibrant objects.
With fibrations $F \subset Mor(\mathbf{C})$
and weak equivalences $W \subset Mor(\mathbf{C})$.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For any object $B$ in $\mathbf{C}$, 
let $\mathbf{C}_B^F$ be the category of fibrations
over $B$:

* objects are fibrations $A \to B$ in $\mathbf{C}$,

* morphisms are commuting triangles 
  $$
    \array{  
      A &&\to&& A'
      \\
      & {}_{\in F}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in F}
      \\
      && B
    }  
  $$
  in $\mathbf{C}$.

There is the obvious forgetful functor 
$f : \mathbf{C}_B^F \o \mathbf{C}$. This induces
a notion of weak equivalence and fibration on 
$\mathbf{C}_B^F$ by. 

With this $\mathbf{C}_B^F$ becomes a category
of fibrant objects.

=--



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Below is proven the _factorization lemma_
that holds in any category of fibrant objects.
This implies in particular that every morphism

$$
  \array{
    A &&\stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to}&& A \times_B A
    \\
    & {}_{\in F}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in F}
    \\
    &&
    B 
  }
$$

may be factored as

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{\in W}{\to}& A^I &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& 
    A \times_B A
    \\
    & {}_{\in F}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in F}
    \\
    &&
    B 
  }
  \,.
$$

This provides the [[path object|path space objects]]
in $\mathbf{C}^F_B$.

# Simple consequences of the definition #

Before looking at more sophisticated constructions, we record the following direct consequences of the definition
of a category of fibrant objects.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

For every two objects $A_1, A_2 \in \mathbf{C}$,
the two projection maps 
$$
  p_i : A_1 \times A_2 \stackrel{\in F}{\to} A_i
$$
out of their [[product]] are fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Because by assumption 
both morphisms $A_i \to {*}$ are fibrations
and fibrations are preserved under pullback

$$
  \array{
    A_1 \times A_2 &\to& A_2
    \\
    \;{}^{p_1}\downarrow^{\Rightarrow \in F} && \downarrow^{\in F}
    \\
    A_1 &\to&  {*}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

For every object $B \in \mathbf{C}$ and
everey [[path object]] $B^I$ of $B$,
the two morphisms
$$
  d_i : B^I \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} B
$$ 
(whose product $d_0 \times d_1$, recall, is required to be
a fibration) are each separately acyclic fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the above lemma 
$d_i : B^I \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} B \times B
  \stackrel{p_i}{\to} B$ is the composite of two fibrations
 and hence itself a fibration.

Moreover, from the diagram

$$
  \array{
    B 
    &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
    B^I 
    &\stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to}&
    B \times B
    \\
    &&&\searrow^{d_i}& \downarrow^{p_i}
    \\
    & \searrow^{Id}&&& B
  }
$$

one reads off that the 2-out-of-3 
property for weak equivalences implies that $d_i$
is also a weak equivalence.

# Generalized universal bundles and the factorization lemma #

A central lemma in the theory of categories of fibrant objects is the following

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma (factorization lemma)

For every morphism $f : C \to D$ in a category
$\mathbf{C}$ of fibrant objects, there is an object 
$\mathbf{E}_f B$ such that $f$ factors as

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{E}_f B
    \\
    & {}^{\sigma_f \in W}\nearrow && \searrow^{p_f \in F}
    \\
    C &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& B
  }
$$

with

* $p_f$ a fibration

* $\sigma_f$ a weak equivalence that is a 
  [[section]] ( a [[inverse|right inverse]]):
  $$
    Id_{\mathbf{E}_f B}
    =
    (
     C
      \stackrel{\sigma_f}{\to}
      \mathbf{E}_f B \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
      C 
    )
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remarks

This is the analog of one of the _factorization axioms_ in a [[model category]] which says that every map factors as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration.

Notice that by 
[[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]] 
this in particular implies that every weak equivalence 
$f : C \stackrel{\in W}{\to} B$
is given by a span of acyclic fibrations. 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{E}_f B
    \\
    & {}^{\sigma_f \in W}\nearrow && 
    \searrow^{p_f \in F\cap W}
    \\
    C &&\stackrel{f \in W}{\to}&& B
  }
  \,.
$$

In the context of [[Lie groupoid]] theory these are known as the [[Morita equivalence]]s between groupoids. 
There here arise as a special case. 
Compar also the notion of [[anafunctor]].

=--

The way the proof of this lemma works, one sees that
this really arises in the wider context of computing
[[homotopy pullback]]s in $C$. Therefore we split the
proof in two steps that are useful in their own right
and will be taken up in the next section on homotopy limits.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition 

For $f : C \to B$ a morphism in $\mathbf{C}$, we say that 
the morphism $p_f : \mathbf{E}_f B \to B$
defined as the composite vertical morphism in the
[[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
   \mathbf{E}_f B &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}\gt& C
   \\
   \downarrow && \downarrow^f
   \\
   B^I &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}& B
   \\
   \downarrow^{d_1}
   \\
   B
  }
$$

for some [[path object|path space object]] $B^I$
is the [[generalized universal bundle]] over $B$
relative to $f$.

=--

The universal bundle terminology is best
understood from the following example

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Consider the category of fibrant objects given by
[[Kan complex]]es or just [[strict omega-groupoid]]s.

For $G$ an ordinary [[group]] write $\mathbf{B} G$
for the corresponding [[groupoid]].
When regarding $G$ as a constant [[simplicial group]]
the corresponding [[Kan complex]] is often denoted
$\bar W G$ (see [[simplicial group]]) but we shall
just write $\mathbf{B} G$ also for this Kan complex,
for simplicity.

The corresponding [[path object]] is given by the [[groupoid]] 
(or its corresponding Kan complex) 
$$
  (\mathbf{B} G)^I
  =
  [\Delta^1, \mathbf{B} G ]
  =
  G \backslash \backslash G//G
$$
where the right denotes the [[action groupoid]]
of $G \times G$ acting on $G$ by left and right multiplication.

Let ${*} : {*} \to \mathbf{B} G$ be the unique
morphism from the [[point]] into $\mathbf{B} G$.
The corresponding generalized universal bundle is

$$
  \mathbf{E}_{*} G = G//G
$$

the [[action groupoid]] of $G$ acting on  itself
from just the right. (The corresponding [[Kan complex]]
is traditionally denoted $W G$ when thought of as a 
[[simplicial group]]).

That $G//G \to \mathbf{B}G$ is indeed the 
universal $G$-[[principal bundle]] 
(under the [[homotopy hypothesis|Quillen equivalence of]]
[[Kan complex]]es and [[topological space]]s) is an
old result of Segal
(as described at [[generalized universal bundle]]).


=--


+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The morphism $p_f : \mathbf{E}_f B \to B$ is
a fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The defining [[pullback]] diagram for $\mathbf{E}_f B$
can be refined to a double pullback diagram as follows

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{E}_f B 
     &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& 
     C \times B 
     &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}& 
     C
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{f \times Id} && \downarrow^f
     \\
     B^I &\stackrel{d_0 \times d_1 \in F}{\to}&
     B \times B &\stackrel{p_1}{\to}&
     B
     \\
     \downarrow^{d_1} & \swarrow_{p_2 \in F}
     \\
     B
  }
  \,.
$$

Both squares are pullback squares. Since
pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations, the morphism
$\mathbf{E}_f B  \to C \times B$ is a fibration.

By one of the lemmas above, also the projection map
$p_i : B \times B \to B$ is a fibration. 

The above diagram exibits $p_f$ as the the composite

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p_f &: \mathbf{E}_f B \to C \times B
    \stackrel{f \times Id}{\to}
    B \times B
    \stackrel{p_2}{\to}
    B
    \\
    & =
    \mathbf{E}_f B \to C \times B
    \stackrel{p_2}{\to}
    B 
  \end{aligned}
$$

of two fibrations. Therefore it is itself a fibration.

#More sophisticated consequences of the definition#

Using the factorization lemma, one obtaines the following
further useful statements about categories of fibrant
objects:

Recall that plain weak equivalences,
if they are not at the same time fibrations,
are not required by the axioms to be preserved by 
[[pullback]]. But it follows from the axioms that
weak equivalences are preserved under pullback along fibrations.

This we establish in two lemmas.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

Let 

$$
 \array{
  A_1 &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& A_2
  \\
  & {}_{\in F}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in F}
  \\
  && B
 }
$$

be a morphism of fibrations over 
some object $B$ in $\mathbf{C}$
and let $u : B' \to B$ be any morphism in 
\mathbf{C}. Let 

$$
 \array{
  u^*A_1 &&\stackrel{u^* f}{\to}&& u^* A_2
  \\
  & {}_{\in F}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in F}
  \\
  && B'
 }
$$

be the corresponding morphism pulled back along $u$.

Then

* if $f \in F$ then also $u^* f \in F$;

* if $f \in W$ then also $u^* f \in W$.



=--

+-- {: .un_proof}
###### Proof

For $f \in F$ the statement follows from 
the fact that in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    B' \times_B A_1 &\to& A_1
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{u^* f \in F} 
    && \;\;\downarrow^{f \in F}
    \\
    B' \times_B A_2 &\to& A_2
    \\
    \;\downarrow^{\in F} && \;\downarrow^{\in F}
    \\
    B' &\stackrel{u}{\to}& B
  }
$$

all squares (the two inner ones as well as the
outer one) are [[pullback]] squares,
since pullback squares compose under pasting.

The same reasoning applies for $f \in W \cap F$.

To apply this reasoning 
to the case where $f \in W$, we first
make use of the factorization lemma 
to decompose $f$ as a right inverse to an
acyclic fibration followed by an
acyclic fibration. 

$$
  f : A_1 \stackrel{\in W}{\to} \mathbf{E}_f A_2 
  \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} A_2
  \,.
$$

(Compare the definition of the category
of fibrant objects
$\mathbf{C}_B^F$ of fibrations over $B$,
discussed in the example section above.)


Using the above this reduces the proof to showing that 
the pullback of the top horizontal morphism of

$$
 \array{
  A_1 &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \mathbf{E}_f A_2
  \\
  & {}_{\in F}\searrow && \swarrow_{\in F}
  \\
  && B
 }
$$

(here the fibration on the right is the composite 
of the fibration $\mathbf{E}_f A_2 \to A_2$ with $A_2 \to B$)

along $u$ is a weak equivalence. For that 
consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    B' \times_B A_1  &\to& A_1
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B' \times_B \mathbf{E}_f A_2 
    &\to& 
    \mathbf{E}_f A_2
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\in W \cap F} 
    && 
      \;\;\downarrow^{\in W \cap F}
    \\
    B' \times_B A_1 &\to& A_1
    \\
    \;\downarrow^{\in F} && \;\downarrow^{\in F}
    \\     
    B' &\to& B
  }
$$

where again all squares are pullback squares.
The top two vertical composite morphisms are
identities. Hence by 2-out-of-3 
the morphism
$B' \times_B E_1 \to B' \times_B \mathbf{E}$
is a weak equivalence.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The pullback of a weak equivalence along a fibration
is again a weak equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof



Let 
$u : B' \to B$ be a weak equivalence and
$ p : E \to B$ be a fibration. We want to show that the
left vertical morphism in the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    E \times_B B' &\to& B'
    \\
    \;\;\;\;\downarrow^{\Rightarrow \in W } 
    && \;\downarrow^{\in W}
    \\
    E &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is a fibration. 

First of all, using the factorization lemma
we may always factor $B' \to B$ as

$B ' \stackrel{\in W}{\to} \mathbf{E}_u B 
 \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} B$

with the first morphism a weak equivalence that is
a right inverse to an acyclic fibration
and the right one an acyclic fibration.

Then the pullback diagram in question may be decomposed
into two consecutive pullback diagrams
$$
  \array{
    E \times_B B' &\to& B'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Q &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& \mathbf{E}_u B
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{\in W \cap F} 
    && \;\;\downarrow^{\in W \cap F}
    \\
    E &\stackrel{\in F}{\to}& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the morphisms are indicated as fibrations and
acyclic fibrations using the stability of these
under arbitrary pullback.

This means that the proof reduces to proving that weak equivalences
$u : B' \stackrel{\in W}{\to} B$ 
that are right inverse to some acyclic fibration
$v : B \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} B'$
map to a weak equivalence under pullback along a fibration.

Given such $u$ with right inverse $v$, 
consider the pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    E
    \\
    & {}_{\in W}\searrow^{p \times Id} && \searrow^{Id}
    \\
    &&
       E_1 := B \times_{B'} E 
    &
       \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} 
    & 
       E
    \\
    &&\downarrow^{\in F} && \downarrow^{p \in F}
    \\
    &&&& B 
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow^{v \in F \cap W}
    \\
    &&B &\stackrel{v \in W \cap F}{\to}& B'
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that the indicated universal morphism 
$p \times Id : E \stackrel{\in W}{\to} E_1$ 
into the pullback is a weak equivalence
by [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]].

The above lemma says that weak equivalences between fibrations over $B$
are themselves preserved by base extension along
$u : B' \to B$. In total this yields the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    u^* E = B' \times_B E
    &\to &E
    \\
    &{}_{\in W}\searrow^{u^*(p \times Id)}
    && {}_{\in W}\searrow^{p \times Id} && \searrow^{Id}
    \\
    &&
    u^* E_1
    &\to&
       E_1     &
       \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} 
    & 
       E
    \\
    &&\downarrow^{\in F}&&\downarrow^{\in F} 
    && \downarrow^{p \in F}
    \\
    &&&&&& B 
    \\
    &&\downarrow&&\downarrow && \downarrow^{v \in F \cap W}
    \\
    &&
    B'
    &\stackrel{u}{\to}&
    B &\stackrel{v \in W \cap F}{\to}& B'
  }
$$

so that with $p \times Id  : E \to E_1$ a
weak equivalence also $u^* (p \times Id)$ 
is a weak equivalence, as indicated.

Notice that $u^* E = B' \times_B E \to E$ is the morphism that we want to show is a weak equivalence.
By 2-out-of-3 for that it is now sufficient to 
show that $u^* E_1  \to E_1$ is a weak equivalence.

That finally follows now since by assumption the
total bottom horizontal morphism is the identity.
Hence so is the top horizontal morphism. Hence
$u^* E_1  \to E_1$ is right inverse to a weak
equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence.

# Homotopy fiber product #

Using the existence of [[path object|path space objects]] one can construct specific [[homotopy pullback]]s
called  _homotopy fiber products_ .


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A **homtopy fiber product** 
or **homotopy pullback** of two morphisms

$$
  A \stackrel{u}{\to} C \stackrel{v}{\leftarrow} B
$$

in a category of fibrant objects
is the object $A \times_C C^I \times_C B$  defined as the 
(ordinary) [[nLab:limit|limit]]

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C C^I \times_C B &&&\to & B
    \\
    &&&& \downarrow^v
    \\
    & &C^I & \stackrel{d_0}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow &&
    \downarrow^{d_1}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{u}{\to} & C    
  }
  \,.
$$

=--



+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

This essentially says that $A \times_C C^I \times_C B$ is the universal object that makes the diagram
$$
  \array{
     A \times_C C^I \times_C B &\to& B
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^v
     \\
     A &\stackrel{u}{\to}& C
  }
$$
commute up to [[homotopy]] 
(see the section on homotopies for more on that).
=--

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma


The projection

$$
 A \times_C C^I \times_C B \to A
$$
out of a homotopy fiber product is a fibration. If $v : B \to C$ is 
a weak equivalence, then this is an acyclic fibration.

=--

The same is of course true for the map to $B$ and the
morphism $u : A \to C$, by symmetry of the diagram.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One may compute this [[nLab:limit|limit]] in terms of two consecutive 
[[nLab:pullback|pullback]]s in two different ways.

On the one hand we have

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C C^I \times_C B &\to& \mathbf{E}_v C &\to 
    & B
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow^v
    \\
    & &C^I & \stackrel{d_0}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow &&
    \downarrow^{d_1}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{u}{\to}& C    
  }
$$

where both squares are [[pullback]] squares. 

By the above lemma on generalized universal bundles,
the map $\mathbf{E}_v C \to C$ is a fibration. The first
claim follows then since fibrations are stable under pullback.

On the other hand we can rewrite the limit diagram also as
$$
  \array{
    A \times_C C^I \times_C B &\to& && B
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow^v
    \\
    \mathbf{E}_u C & \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to} &C^I & 
    \stackrel{d_0 \in W \cap F}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow^{\in W \cap F} 
    &&
    \;\;\downarrow^{d_1\in W \cap F}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{u}{\to} & C    
  }
$$

where again both inner squares are [[pullback]] squares.

Again by the above statement on generalized universal
bundles, we have that the morphism 
$\mathbf{E}_u C \to C$ is a fibration.
By one of the above propositions, weak equivalences
are stable under pullback along fibrations, hence the pullback 
$A \times_C C^I \times_C B \to \mathbf{E}_u C$
of $v$ is a weak equivalence. Since also 
$\mathbf{E}_u C \to A$ is a weak equivalence 
(being the pullback of an acyclic fibration)
the entire morphism 
$A \times_C C^I \times_C B  \to A$ is.

# Homotopies #


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Two morphism $f,g : A \to B$ in $C(A,B)$
are 

* **right [[homotopy|homotopic]]**, denoted $f \simeq g$, precisely if they fit into a diagram
  $$
    \array{
      && B
      \\
      & {}^f\nearrow & \uparrow^{d_0}
      \\
      A &\stackrel{\eta}{\to}&
      B^I
      \\
      & {}_g\searrow & \downarrow^{d_1}
      \\
      && B
    }
  $$ 
  for some [[path object|path space object]] $B^I$;

* **[[homotopy|homotopic]]**, denoted $f \sim g$,
  if they become right homotopic after pulled back
  to a weakly equivalent domain, 
  i.e. precisely if they fit into a diagram

$$
  \array{
    &&
    A 
    &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    \\
    &{}^{w \in W}\nearrow&&& \uparrow^{d_0}
    \\
    \hat A 
    &&
    \stackrel{\eta}{\to}
    &&
    B^I
    \\
    &{}_{w\in W}\searrow & &&
    \downarrow^{d_1}
    \\
    &&
    A
    &\stackrel{g}{\to}& 
    B
  }
$$

for some object $\hat A$ and
for some [[path object|path space object]] $B^I$ of $I$

=--

**Remark** So this says that there is a
right [[homotopy]] between the two morphisms after
both are pulled back to a sufficiently good resolution of 
their domain.


+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

For $A,B \in \mathbf{C}$, right homotopy
is an equivalence relation on the 
[[hom-set]] $\mathbbf{C}(A,B)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows by "piecong path spaces together":

Let $B^{I_1}$ and $B^{I_2}$ be two path space
objects of $B$. Then the pullback

$$
  \array{
    B^{I_1 \vee I_2} &\to&  B^{I_2}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{d_0}
    \\
    B^{I_1} &\stackrel{d_1}{\to}& B
  }
$$

defines a new path object, with structure maps

$$
  B
  \stackrel{\sigma_1 \times \sigma_2}{\to}
  B^{I_1 \vee I_2}
  \stackrel{(d_0 \circ p_1) \times (d_1\circ p_2)}{\to}
  B \times B
  \,.
$$

So given two right homotopies 
with respect to $B^{I_1}$ and $B^{i_2}$ we can paste them
next to each other and deduce a homotopy through 
$B^{I_1 \vee I_2}$

$$
  \array{
    && B
    \\
    & {}^f\nearrow &  \uparrow^{d_0^1}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{\eta_1}{\to}&
    B^{I_1}
    \\
    & {}_{g}\searrow& \downarrow^{d_1^1}
    & \nwarrow
    \\
    && B && B^{I_1 \vee I_2}
    \\
    & {}^{g}\nearrow & \downarrow^{d_0^2}
    & \swarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{\eta_2}{\to}& B^{I_2}
    \\
    & {}_h\searrow & \downarrow^{d_1^2}
    \\
    &&B
  }
$$

=--


We next similarly want to deduce that not only right homotopy
$f \simeq g$ but also true homtopy $f \sim g$
defines an equivalence relation on [[hom-set]]s 
$\mathbf{C}(A,B)$. For that we need the following to lemmas.

may be refined to a diagram

    A &\to & X' &\to& E

$$

Consider the pullback square

    &&
    \;\; \downarrow^{\in F}
    \\
    && X &\to& B
  }
$$

and apply the factorization lemma to factor 
the universal morphism $A \to X \times_B E \to E$
into the pullback as

$$
  A \stackrel{\in W}{\to} \mathbf{E} E \stackrel{\in F}{\to}
  E
$$ 

to obtain the diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}&
    \mathbf{E} E &\to& E 
    \\
    &{}_{i \in W}\searrow& 
    \;\; \downarrow^{\in F}
    &&
    \;\; \downarrow^{\in F}
    \\
    && X &\to& B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the middle vertical morphism is still a
fibration, being the composite of two fibrations.
By [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]]
it follows that it is also a weak equivalence.

###### Proposition

Right homotopy $f \simeq g$ between morphisms 
is preserved under pre- and postcomposition with a given morphism.

More precisely,
let $f, g : B \to C$ be two homotopic morphisms. Then 

* for all morphisms $A \to B$ and $C \to D$ the composites
$A \to B \stackrel{f}{\to} C \to D$ and $A \to B \stackrel{g}{\to} C \to D$
are still right homotopic.

* moreover, the right homotopy may be realized 
  with every given choice of   
  [[nLab:path object|path space object]] $D^I$ for $D$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We decompose this into two statements:

1. for any $A \to B$ the morphisms $A \to B \stackrel{f,g}{\to} B$ are right homotopic.

1. for any $u : C \to D$ and choice $D^I$ of path object there is an acyclic fibration
   $
     B' \to B
   $
   such that 
   $B' \to B \stackrel{f}{\to} C \to D$ 
   is right homotopic to
   $B' \to B \stackrel{g}{\to} C \to D$
   by a right homotopy $\eta : B' \to D^I$.
   
The first of these follows trivially.

The second one follows by using the weak functoriality property of path objects
from above: let $B' := B \times_{C^I} C^{I'}$ 
be the [[pullback]]
in the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    B' 
    &\to&
    C^{I'}

for seeing that homotopy is an equivalence relation

  $t \circ f \simeq t \circ g$, there exists
  a weak equivalence $t' : A' \to A$
  such that $f \circ t' \simeq g \circ t'$.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


* The first point we accomplish this by letting $A' := A \times_C C^I \times_C B$ be the homotopy fiber product
in $C$ of a representative of the pullback diagram. 
The lemma 
about morphisms out of the
homotopy fiber product says 
that $A' \to A$ is a weak equivalence.

* The second point is more work. 
  Let $\eta : A \to C^I$ the right homotopy in question. 
  We start by considering
  the homotopy fiber product
  $$
    \array{
      D := B \times_C C^I \times_C B
      &\to&&\stackrel{\in W}{\to}& B
      \\
      \downarrow^{\in W} &&&&
      \downarrow^{t \in W}

      && C^I &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}&
      C

      \downarrow && \downarrow^{d_1}
      \\
      B &\stackrel{t \in W}{\to}& C
    }
    \,,
  $$
  where the long morphisms are weak equivalences
  by the lemma on morphisms out of homotopy fiber products.

 Then consider the two universal morphisms
  $$
   (f,\eta,g) : A \to B \times_C C^I \times_C B
  $$
  and
  $$
    (Id, \sigma \circ t, Id) : 
    B \stackrel{\in W}{\to} B \times_C C^I \times_C B
  $$
  into that. It follows by 2-out-of-3 that the latter
  is a weak equivalence. Factoring this 
  using the factorization lemma produces hence
  $$
    B \stackrel{\in W}{\to} D' \stackrel{\in W \cap F}{\to}
    D
    \,.
  $$

  We know moreover that the product map 
  $D \stackrel{\in F}{\to} B \times B$
  is a fibration, as we can rewrite the homotopy
  limit as the pullback
  $$
    \array{  
       D &\to& C^I
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\in F}
       \\
       B \times B &\stackrel{f \times g}{\to}&
       C \times C
    }
    \,.
  $$

  It follows that the composite $D' \to D \to B \times B$
  is a fibration and hence $D'$ a path space object for
  $B$.

  Finally, by setting $A' = A \times_D D'$
  we obtaine the desired right homotopy
  $f \circ t' \simeq g \circ t'$.
  $$
    \array{
      A' &\to& D'
      \\
      \downarrow^{t'} && \downarrow
      \\
      A &\to & D &\to & C^I
      \\
      & {}_{f \times g}\searrow & \downarrow 
      && \downarrow 
      \\
      && B \times B
      &\stackrel{t \times t}{\to}&
      C \times C
    }
    \,.
  $$

###### Lemma

The relation "$f, g \in C(A,B)$ are homotopic",
$f \sim g$,
is an [[equivalence relation]] on $C(A,B)$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The nontrivial part is to show transitivity.
This now follows with the above lemma
about homtopy commutative composition of 
pullback diagrams and then using the
"piecing together of path objects"
used above to show that right homotopy
is an equivalence relation.

###### Definition

For $C$ a category of fibrant objects the category
$\pi C$ is defined to be the category

* with the same objects as $C$;

* with [[hom-set]]s the set of equivalence classes
  $$
   \pi C(A,B) := C(A,B)/_\sim
  $$
  under the above equivalence relation.

* Composition in $\pi C$ is given by composition of
  representatives in $C$.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The obvious functor

$$
  C \to \pi C
$$

is the identity on objects and the projection to
[[equivalence relation|equivalence classes]] on
[[hom-set]].

Let $\pi W \subset Mor(\pi C)$ be the image of the 
weak equivalences of $C$ in $\pi C$ under this functor,
and $\pi F$ the image of the fibrations.

###### Theorem

The weak equivalences in $\pi C$ form  a left multiplicative system.

This is now a direct consequence of the above
lemma on homotopy-commutative completions of diagrams.

# The homotopy category #

We discuss now 
that the structure of a category of fibrant objects on a 
[[homotopical category]] $C$ induces 

* a related category $\pi C$ 

* with a morphism $C \to \pi C$

  * that is the identity on objects, 
  
  * and induces on $\pi C$ a notion of weak equivalences
    $$
      \pi W \subset Mor(\pi C)
    $$
    and fibrations
    $$
      \pi F \subset Mor(\pi C)
    $$

* such that

  * the weak equivalences in $\pi C$ form a [[calculus of fractions|left multiplicative system]] .

This implies the following convenient construction
of the [[homotopy category]] of $C$:

+-- {: .un}
###### Theorem

For $C$ a category of fibrant objects, 
its [[homotopy category]] is 
([[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to) the category
$Ho_C$ with

* the same objects as $C$;

* the [[hom-set]] $Ho_C(A,B)$ for all $A, B \in Obj(C)$
  given naturally by
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      Ho_C(A,B) 
      & \simeq 
      colim_{\hat A \stackrel{w\in \pi W}{\to} A}
      \pi C (\hat A,B)
      \\
      & =
      colim_{\hat A \stackrel{f\in \pi W\cap F}{\to} A}
      \pi C (\hat A,B)      
    \end{aligned}
    \,.
  $$

=--

Here the colimit is, as described at [[calculus of fractions|multiplicative system]], over the [[opposite category]] of the category $\pi W_A$ or $(\pi F\cap \pi W)_A$ 
whose objects are weak equivalences $\hat A \stackrel{w \in \pi W}{\to} A$ or acyclic fibrations
$\hat A \stackrel{f \in \pi W\cap F}{\to} A$ in $\pi C$, and whose morphisms are commuting triangles

$$
  \array{
    \hat A &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& \hat A'
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &&
    A
  }
$$
in $\pi C$ (i.e. for arbitrary $h$).

So more in detail the above colimit is over the functor

$$
  \pi C(-, B)_A : 
  (\pi W_A)^{op} \to (\pi C)^{op} 
  \stackrel{\pi C(-, B)}{\to}
  Set
  \,,
$$

where the first functor is the obvious forgetful functor.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

It is again the factorization lemma above (and using 2-out-of-3 that implies that inverting just the acyclic fibrations in $C$ is already equivalent to inverting all weak equivalences. This means that the above theorem remains valid if the weak equivalences $t : A' \to A$ are replaced by _acyclic fibrations_.

Using acyclic fibrations here has the advantage that these are preserved under [[pullback]]. This allows to consistently compose spans whose left leg is an acyclic fibration by [[pullback]]. See [[homotopical cohomology theory]] and [[anafunctor]].

A discussion of this point of using weak equivalences versus acyclic fibrations in the construction of the homotopy category is also in Jardine: [Cocycle categories](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0782/).

We now provide the missing definitions and then the proof
of this theorem.


+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

The homotopy categories of $C$ and $\pi C$ coincide:

$$
  Ho_C \simeq Ho_{\pi C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By one of the lemmas above, the morphisms
$d_i : B^I \to B$ are weak equivalences
and become [[isomorphism]]s in $Ho_C$.
The [[section]] $\sigma : B \to B^I$
then becomes an [[inverse]] for both 
of them, hence the images of $d_0$ and
$d_1$ in $Ho_C$ coincide. Therefore
the above diagram says that homotopic morphisms
in $C$ become equal in $Ho_C$.

But this means that the localization morphism
$$
  Q_C : C \to Ho_C
$$
factors through $\pi C$ as

$$
  Q_C : C \to \pi C \stackrel{Q_{\pi C}}{\to} Ho_C
$$

where $Q_{\pi C}$ sends weak equivalences in $\pi C$
to isomorphisms in $Ho_C$.

The universal property of $Q$ then implies the universal
property for $Q_{\pi C}$

$$
  \array{
    C &\to& \pi C &\to & A
    \\
    \downarrow^{Q_C} & \swarrow^{Q_{\pi C}} && \swarrow
    \\
    Ho_C
  }
  \,.
$$

=--



The above theorem on the description of $Ho_C$
now follows from the general formula for
[[localization]] at a 
[[calculus of fractions|left multiplicative system]]
of weak equivalences.

# Pointed category of fibrant objects #

If the category $C$ of fibrant objects has an initial object which _coincides_ with the terminal object $e$, i.e. a [[zero object]], then $C$ is a [[pointed category]]. In this case we have the following additional concepts and structures.

## Fibers ##

 For $p : Y \to X$ a fibration, the pullback $F$ in

$$
  \array{
     F &\stackrel{i}{\to}& Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     e &\to& X
  }
$$

is the **fibre** of $p$ and $i$ is the _fibre inclusion_.
(This is the _kernel_ of the morphism $f$ of [[pointed object]]s)


## [[fibration sequence|Fibration sequences]] ##

For $B$ any object and $B^I$ any of its [[path object]]s, the fiber of $B^I \stackrel{d_0 \times d_1}{\to} B \times B$ is the **[[loop space object|loop object]]** $\Omega^{(I)} B$ of $B$ with respect to the chosen path object. This construction becomes independent up to canonical isomorphism of the chosen path space after mapping to the [[homotopy category]] and hence there is a functor

$$
  \Omega : Ho_C \to Ho_C
$$

which sends any object $B$ of $C$ to its canonical loop object $\Omega B$.

Any loop object $\Omega B$ becomes a group object in $Ho_C$, i.e. a group [[internalization|internal to]] $Ho_C$ in a natural way.



# Application in cohomology theory #

When the catgegory of fibrant objects is that of locally Kan simplicial sheaves, the [[hom-set]]s of its 
[[homotopy category]] compute generalized notions of [[cohomology]].

At [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] is a detailed discussion of how the ordinary notion of sheaf cohomology arises as a special case of that.
