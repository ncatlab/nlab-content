## Idea

A [[model category]] structure $(\mathcal{C}(W,Fib,Cof))$ on some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a means to guarantee the [[locally small category|local smallness]] and to improve the tractability of the [[homotopy category]] of the underlying [[category with weak equivalences]] $(\mathcal{C},W)$. In particular, if a [[category with weak equivalences]] admits a [[model category]] structure, then its [[homotopy category]] in the sense of [[localization]] $\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]$ at the class of [[weak equivalences]] is equivalent to the category whose objects are those objects of $\mathcal{C}$ which are both fibrant cofibrant with respect to the model structure, and whose morphisms are the actual [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms between these objects ([[left homotopy]] or [[right homotopy]] [[equivalence classes]] as determined by the model structure) .
