## Idea

A [[model category]] structure $(\mathcal{C}(W,Fib,Cof))$ on some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a means to guarantee the [[locally small category|local smallness]] and to improve the tractability of the [[homotopy category]] of the underlying [[category with weak equivalences]] $(\mathcal{C},W)$. In particular, if a [[category with weak equivalences]] admits a [[model category]] structure, then its [[homotopy category]] (in the sense of [[localization]] $\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]$ at the class of [[weak equivalences]]) is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category whose objects are those objects of $\mathcal{C}$ which are both fibrant cofibrant, and whose morphisms are the actual [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms between these objects ([[left homotopy]] or [[right homotopy]] [[equivalence classes]] in the sense of [[homotopy in a model category]]) .

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. Write $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are those objects of $\mathcal{C}$ which are both fibrant and cofibrant;

* [[morphisms]] are the [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$, hence the [[equivalence classes]] of morphism under [[left homotopy]].

=--

This is, up to [[equivalence of categories]], the _homotopy category of the model category_ $\mathcal{C}$.

## Universal property

We spell out that def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} indeed satisfies the [[universal property]] that defines the [[homotopy category]] of a [[category with weak equivalences]].

+-- {: .num_lemma #WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}
###### Lemma
**([[Whitehead theorem]] in model categories)**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[model category]]. A [[weak equivalence]] between two objects which are both fibrant and cofibrant is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

=--

(e.g. [Goerss-Jardine 99, part I, theorem 1.10](#GoerssJardine99))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the factorization axioms in $\mathcal{C}$, every weak equivalence $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ factors through an object $Z$ as an acyclic cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration. In particular it follows that with $X$ and $Y$ both fibrant and cofibrant, so is $Z$, and hence it is sufficient to prove that acyclic (co-)fibrations between such objects are homotopy equivalences.

So let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be an acyclic fibration between fibrant-cofibrant objects, the case of acyclic cofibrations is [[formal dual|formally dual]]. Then in fact it has a genuine [[right inverse]] given by a lift $f^{-1}$ in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\rightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in cof}}\downarrow 
     &{}^{{f^{-1}}}\nearrow& 
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib \cap W}}
    \\
    X &=& X
  }
  \,.
$$

To see that $f^{-1}$ is also a [[left inverse]] up to [[left homotopy]], let $Cyl(X)$ be any [[cylinder object]] on $X$, hence a factorization of the [[codiagonal]] on $X$ as a cofibration followed by a an acyclic fibration 

$$
  X \sqcup X \stackrel{\iota_X}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

and consider the square

$$
  \array{
    X \sqcup X 
    &\stackrel{(f^{-1}\circ f, id)}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_X}}{}_{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}_{\mathrlap{\in W \cap Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(X) &\underset{f\circ \sigma}{\longrightarrow}& y
  }
  \,,
$$

which [[commuting square|commutes]] due to $f^{-1}$ being a genuine right inverse of $f$. By construction, this [[commuting square]] now admits a [[lift]] $\eta$, and that constitutes a [[left homotopy]] $\eta \colon f^{-1}\circ f \Rightarrow_L id$.

+-- {: .num_defn #FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}
###### Definition

Given a [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$, consider a _choice_ for each object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ of 

1. a factorization $\emptyset \underoverset{\in Cof}{i_X}{\longrightarrow} Q X \underoverset{\in W \cap Fib}{p_x}{\longrightarrow} X$ of the initial morphism, such that when $X$ is already cofibrant then $p_X = id_X$;

1. a factorization $X \underoverset{\in W \cap Cof}{j_X}{\longrightarrow} R X \underoverset{\in Fib}{q_x}{\longrightarrow} \ast$ of the terminal morphism, such that when $X$ is already fibrant then $j_X = id_X$.

Write then 

$$
  \gamma_{R,Q} 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}
   \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C})
$$

for the [[functor]] to the homotopy category, def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}, which sends an object $X$ to the object $R Q X$ and sends a morphism $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ to the [[homotopy class]] of the result of first lifting in 

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\longrightarrow& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i_X}}\downarrow &{}^{Q f}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_Y}}
    \\
    Q X &\underset{f\circ p_X}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

and then lifting (here: [[extension|extending]]) in 

$$
  \array{ 
    Q X &\overset{j_{Q Y} \circ Q f}{\longrightarrow}& R Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{j_{Q X}}}\downarrow &{}^{R Q f}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{q_{Q Y}}}
    \\
    R Q X
    &\longrightarrow&
    \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #ConstructionOfLocalizationFunctorForModelCategoryIsWellDefined}
###### Lemma

The construction in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} is indeed well defined.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, the object $R Q X$ is indeed both fibrant and cofibrant (as well as related by a [[zig-zag]] of weak equivalences to $X$):  

$$
  \array{
     \emptyset 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in Cof}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\in Cof}}
     \\
     Q X &\underset{\in W \cap Cof}{\longrightarrow}& R Q X &\underset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}& \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\in W}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Now to see that the image on morphisms is well defined. First observe that any two choices $(Q f)_{i}$ of the first lift in the definition are left homotopic to each other, exhibited by lifting in

$$
  \array{
    Q X \sqcup Q X &\stackrel{((Q f)_1, (Q f)_2 )}{\longrightarrow}& Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Cof}}\downarrow 
     && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{Y}}}_{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    Cyl(Q X)
    &\underset{f \circ p_{X} \circ \sigma_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence also the composites $j_{Q Y}\circ (Q_f)_i $ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to each other, and since their domain is cofibrant, they are also [[right homotopy|right homotopic]] (via [this](homotopy+in+a+model+category#LeftHomotopyWithCofibrantDomainImpliesRightHomotopyAndDually) lemma) by a right homotopy $\kappa$. This implies finally, by lifting in

$$
  \array{
    Q X &\overset{\kappa}{\longrightarrow}& Path(R Q Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\in W \cap Cof}}\downarrow 
     && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Fib}}
    \\
    R Q X &\underset{(R (Q f)_1, R (Q f)_2)}{\longrightarrow}&
    R Q Y \times R Q Y
  }
$$

that also $R (Q f)_1$ and $R (Q f)_2$ are right homotopic, hence that indeed $R Q f$ represents a well-defined [[homotopy class]].

Finally to see that the assignment is indeed [[functor|functorial]], observe that the commutativity of the lifting diagrams for $Q f$ and $R Q f$ imply that also the following diagram commutes

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\overset{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& R Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underset{p_y}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underset{j_{Q Y}}{\longrightarrow}& R Q Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Now from the [[pasting]] composite 

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\overset{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& R Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underset{p_Y}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underset{j_{Q Y}}{\longrightarrow}& R Q Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q g}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R Q g}}
    \\
    Z &\underset{p_Z}{\longleftarrow}& Q Z &\underset{j_{Q Z}}{\longrightarrow}& R Q Z
  }
$$

one sees that $(R Q g)\circ (R Q f)$ is a lift of $g \circ f$ and hence the same argument as above gives that it is homotopic to the chosen $ R Q(g \circ f)$. 


=--

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyCategoryOfACategoryWithWeakEquivalences}
###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[category with weak equivalences]], its _[[homotopy category]]_ (or: _[[localization]]_ at the weak equivalences) is, if it exists, a [[category]] $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ equipped with a [[functor]] 

$$
  \gamma \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Ho(C)
$$ 

which sends weak equivalences to [[isomorphisms]], and which is [[universal property|universal with this property]]:

for $F \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow D$ any [[functor]] out of $\mathcal{C}$ into any [[category]], such that $F$ takes weak equivalences to [[isomorphisms]], it factors through $\gamma$ up to a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{C} && \overset{F}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\gamma}}\searrow &\Downarrow^{\rho}& \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde F}}
    \\
    && Ho(\mathcal{C})
  }
$$

and this factorization is unique up to unique isomorphism, in that for $(\tilde F_1, \rho_1)$ and $(\tilde F_2, \rho_2)$ two such factorizations, then there is a unique [[natural isomorphism]] $\kappa \colon \tilde F_1 \Rightarrow \tilde F_2$ making the evident diagram of natural isomorphisms commute.

=--


+-- {: .num_theorem #UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory}
###### Theorem

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[model category]], the functor $\gamma_{R,Q}$ in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} (for any choice of $R$ and $Q$) exhibits $Ho(\mathcal{C})$ as indeed being the [[homotopy category]] of the underlying [[category with weak equivalences]], in the sense of def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfACategoryWithWeakEquivalences}. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First, to see that that $\gamma$ indeed takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms: By [[two-out-of-three]] applied to the [[commuting diagrams]] shown in the proof of lemma \ref{ConstructionOfLocalizationFunctorForModelCategoryIsWellDefined} the morphism $R Q f$ is a weak equivalence if $f$ is:

$$
  \array{
    X &\underoverset{\simeq}{p_X}{\longleftarrow}& Q X &\underoverset{\simeq}{j_{Q X}}{\longrightarrow}& R Q X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R Q f}}
    \\
    Y &\underoverset{p_y}{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}& Q Y &\underoverset{j_{Q Y}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& R Q Y
  }
$$

With this the "Whitehead theorem for model categories", lemma \ref{WhiteheadTheoremInModelCategories}, implies that $R Q f$ represents an isomorphism in $Ho(\mathcal{C})$.

Now let $F \colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow D$ be any functor that sends weak equivalences to isomorphisms. We need to show that it factors as

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{C} && \overset{F}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\gamma}}\searrow &\Downarrow^{\rho}& \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde F}}
    \\
    && Ho(\mathcal{C})
  }
$$

uniquely up to unique [[natural isomorphism]]. Now by construction of $R$ and $Q$ in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory}, $\gamma_{R,Q}$ is the identity on the [[full subcategory]] of fibrant-cofibrant objects. It follows that if $\tilde F$ exists at all, it must satisfy for all $X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y$ with $X$ and $Y$ both fibrant and cofibrant that 

$$
  \tilde F([f]) \simeq F(f)
  \,.
$$ 

But by def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} that already fixes $\tilde F$ on all of $Ho(\mathcal{C})$, up to unique [[natural isomorphism]]. Hence it only remains to check that with this definition of $\tilde F$ there exists any [[natural isomorphism]] $\rho$ filling the diagram above. 

To that end, apply $F$ to the above [[commuting diagram]] to obtain

$$
  \array{
    F(X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(p_X)}{\longleftarrow}& F(Q X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(j_{Q X})}{\longrightarrow}& F(R Q X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(Q f)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(R Q f)}}
    \\
    F(Y) &\underoverset{F(p_y)}{iso}{\longleftarrow}& F(Q Y) &\underoverset{F(j_{Q Y})}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(R Q Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here now all horizontal morphisms are [[isomorphisms]], by assumption on $F$. It follows that defining $\rho_X \coloneqq F(j_{Q X}) \circ F(p_X)^{-1}$ makes the required natural isomorphism:

$$
  \array{
    \rho_X \colon & F(X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(p_X)^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}& F(Q X) &\underoverset{iso}{F(j_{Q X})}{\longrightarrow}& F(R Q X)
   &=&
   \tilde F(\gamma_{R,Q}(X))
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{F(f)}}\downarrow 
     && 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(R Q f)}}
     && \downarrow^{\tilde F(\gamma_{R,Q}(X))}
    \\
    \rho_Y\colon& F(Y) &\underoverset{F(p_y)^{-1}}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(Q Y) &\underoverset{F(j_{Q Y})}{iso}{\longrightarrow}& F(R Q Y)
   &=&
   \tilde F(\gamma_{R,Q}(X))
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark #EssentialUniquenessOfLocalizationFunctorOfModelCategory}
###### Remark

Due to theorem \ref{UniversalPropertyOfHomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} we may suppress the choices of cofibrant $Q$ and fibrant replacement $R$ in def. \ref{FibrantCofibrantReplacementFunctorToHomotopyCategory} and just speak of [[generalized the|the]] [[localization functor]]

While the construction of the homotopy category in def. \ref{HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory} combines the restriction to good (fibrant/cofibrant) objects with the passage to [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms, it is often useful to consider intermediate stages:

for the system of [[full subcategory]] inclusions on the cofibrant objects ($\mathcal{C}_c$), the fibrant objects ($\mathcal{C}_f$) and the objects which are both fibrant and cofibrant ($\mathcal{C}_{fc}$), all regarded a [[categories with weak equivalences]], via the weak equivalences inherited from $\mathcal{C}$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Of course the subcategories in def. \ref{FullSubcategoriesOfFibrantCofibrantObjects} inherit more structure than just that of [[categories with weak equivalences]] from $\mathcal{C}$. $\mathcal{C}_f$ and $\mathcal{C}_c$ each inherit "half" of the factorization axioms. One says that $\mathcal{C}_f$ has the structure of a "[[fibration category]]" called a "[[category of fibrant objects]]", while $\mathcal{C}_c$ has the structure of a "[[cofibration category]]".

In practice it turns out to be useful to arrange for the assumptions in corollary \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctors} to be satisfied in the following neat way:

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}$ be [[model categories]]. A pair of [[adjoint functors]] between them

  (L \dashv R)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}
    \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{D}

is called a _[[Quillen adjunction]]_ (and $L$,$R$ are called left/right _Quillen functors_, respectively) if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied

1. $L$ preserves cofibrations and $R$ preserves fibrations;

1. $L$ preserves acyclic cofibrations and $R$ preserves acyclic fibrations;

1. $L$ preserves cofibrations and acylic cofibrations;

1. $R$ preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations.

###### Proposition

The conditions in def. \ref{QuillenAdjunction} are indeed all equivalent.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that

* (i) _A [[left adjoint]] $L$ between [[model categories]] preserves acyclic cofibrations precisely if its [[right adjoint]] $R$ preserves fibrations.

* (ii) _A [[left adjoint]] $L$ between [[model categories]] preserves cofibrations precisely if its [[right adjoint]] $R$ preserves acyclic fibrations.

We discuss statement (i), statement (ii) is [[formal dual|formally dual]].  So let $f\colon A \to B$ be an acyclic cofibration in $\mathcal{D}$ and $g \colon X \to Y$ a fibration in $\mathcal{C}$. Then for every [[commuting diagram]] as on the left of the following, its $(L\dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] is a commuting diagram as on the right here:

$$
  \array{
    A &\longrightarrow& R(X)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{R(g)}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& R(Y)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    L(A) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{L(f)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    L(B) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If $L$ preserves acyclic cofibrations, then the diagram on the right has a [[lift]], and so the $(L\dashv R)$-[[adjunct]] of that lift is a lift of the left diagram. This shows that $R(g)$ has the [[right lifting property]] against all acylic cofibrations and hence is a fibration. 
Conversely, if $R$ preserves fibrations, the same argument run from right to left gives that $L$ preserves acyclic fibrations.

Now by repeatedly applying (i) and (ii), all four conditions in question are seen to be equivalent.

###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}$ two [[model categories]],  a [[Quillen adjunction]] (def.\ref{QuillenAdjunction})

  (L \dashv R)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}
    \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}

is called a **[[Quillen equivalence]]** if the following equivalent conditions hold.

1. The [[right derived functor]] of $R$ (via prop. \ref{ConditionsOnQuillenAdjunctionAreIndeedEquivalent}, corollary \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctors}) is an [[equivalence of categories]]

   $$
     \mathbb{R}R \colon Ho(\mathcal{C}) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Ho(\mathcal{D})

1. The [[left derived functor]] of $L$ (via prop. \ref{ConditionsOnQuillenAdjunctionAreIndeedEquivalent}, corollary \ref{LeftAndRightDerivedFunctors}) is an [[equivalence of categories]]

   $$
     \mathbb{L}L \colon Ho(\mathcal{D}) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Ho(\mathcal{C})
     \,.
   $$


1. For every cofibrant object $d \in \mathcal{D}$ and every fibrant object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, a morphism $d \longrightarrow R(c)$ is a weak equivalence precisely if its [[adjunct]] morphism $L(c) \to d$ is

   $$
      \frac{
        d \overset{\in W_{\mathcal{D}}}{\longrightarrow} R(c)
      }{
         L(d) \overset{\in W_{\mathcal{C}}}{\longrightarrow} c
      }
      \,.
   $$

1. For every cofibrant object $d\in \mathcal{C}$, the composite 

   $$
     d \longrightarrow R(L(d)) \longrightarrow R(L(d)^{fib})
   $$ 

   (of the [[adjunction unit]] with any fibrant replacement) is a weak equivalence. 

  1. For every fibrant object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the composite 
  
     $$
       L(R(c)^{cof}) \longrightarrow L(R(c)) \longrightarrow c
     $$ 

     (of the [[adjunction counit]] with any cofibrant replacement) is a weak equivalence in $D$.
