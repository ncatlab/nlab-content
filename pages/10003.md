## Idea

The refinement of the notion of [[fixed point]]/[[invariant]] to [[homotopy theory]]. Also _[[homotopy invariant]]_

See at

* [Invariants -- For infinity-group actions](invariant#ForInfinityGroupActions)

* [Infinity-action -- Invariants](infinity-action#Invariants)

## Properties

### Presentation

Generally, for $G$ an [[∞-group]] and $X$ equipped with an [[∞-action]], then the homotopy fixed points is the [[base change]] along/[[dependent product]] over the [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$:

$$
  (-)^{h G}
  \;\colon\;
  G Act(\mathbf{H})
  \simeq
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
  \stackrel{\prod_{\mathbf{B}G}}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

By the general discussion at _[[dependent product]]_ this is given by forming [[sections]], which by the discussion at [[∞-action]] here means forming sections of the $X$-[[associated ∞-bundle]] to the universal [[principal ∞-bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\to& X//G
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G 
  }
  \,.
$$

This is the same as maps out of the point equipped with the trivial $G$-action.

$$
  X^{h G}
  \simeq
  G Act(\ast, X)
  \,.
$$


For [[geometrically discrete ∞-groupoid|geometrically discrete]] [[∞-group]] [[∞-actions]], hence for $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]], it is the [[Borel model structure]] which [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the [[homotopy theory]]. By the discusison there, there [[derived hom space]] is computed as the hom-space out of plain [[actions]] of [[simplicial groups]] out of the total space of the simplicial [[universal principal bundle]] $\mathbf{E}G = W G$. Therefore in this case one finds

$$
  X^{h G}
  \simeq
  R Hom_G(\ast, X)
  \simeq
  Hom_G(E G, X)
  \,.
$$

This is the form in which homotopy fixed points are often defined in traditional literature (for instance in the historical discussion of the [[Sullivan conjecture]] ).
