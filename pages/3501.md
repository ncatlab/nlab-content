To a space (typically with singularities) of certain kind (there are variants) one associates category whose objects are called **perverse sheaves**. They are neither perverse nor sheaves; but they are related to some sheaf categories and notably [[intersection cohomology]]. Perversity is a parameter involved in grading of intersection cohomology groups. Another feature similar to sheaves is that they are somehow determined by the local data; there is a famous gluing due [[Sasha Beilinson]].
