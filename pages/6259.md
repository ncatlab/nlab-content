## Idea

The standard [[action functional]] for the higher abelian [[gauge field]] given by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $(P, \nabla)$ over a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|(pseudo)]] [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is 

$$
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star_g F_{\nabla}
  \,,
$$

where $F_\nabla$ is the [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form. If the [[dimension]] 

$$
  dim X = 4 k + 2 
$$

then the [[Hodge star]] operator squares to $+1$ (Lorentian signature) or $-1$ (Euclidean signature) on $\Omega^{k+1}(X)$. Therefore it makes sense in these dimensions to impose the _self-duality constraint_

$$
  \pm F_\nabla = \star F_\nabla
  \,.
$$

With this duality constraint imposed, one speaks of _self-dual_ higher gauge fields. Their [[quantum field theory]] is more subtle than usual: first of all the above standard action functional now vanishes constantly. 

But sense can be made of the theory of self-dual gauge fields by other means. Notably --  by a version of the [[holographic principle]] the -- [[partition function]] of the self-dual theory on an $X$ of dimension $4 k +2$ is given by the [[state]] (wave function) of an abelian  [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory|higher Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension $4 k + 3$.
