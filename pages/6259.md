## Idea

The standard [[action functional]] for the [[higher U(1)-gauge field]] given by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $(P, \nabla)$ over a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|(pseudo)]] [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is 

$$
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star_g F_{\nabla}
  \,,
$$

where $F_\nabla$ is the [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form. If the [[dimension]] 

$$
  dim X = 4 k + 2 
$$

then the [[Hodge star]] operator squares to $+1$ (Lorentian signature) or $-1$ (Euclidean signature) on $\Omega^{k+1}(X)$. Therefore it makes sense in these dimensions to impose the _self-duality_ or _chirality_ constraint

$$
  \pm F_\nabla = \star F_\nabla
  \,.
$$

With this duality constraint imposed, one speaks of _self-dual_ higher gauge fields. Their [[quantum field theory]] is more subtle than usual: first of all the above standard action functional now vanishes constantly. 

But sense can be made of the theory of self-dual gauge fields by other means. Notably --  by a version of the [[holographic principle]] the -- [[partition function]] of the self-dual theory on an $X$ of dimension $4 k +2$ is given by the [[state]] (wave function) of an abelian  [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory|higher Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension $4 k + 3$.

## Examples

### Chiral boson in 2d

(...)

The simplest case. A review is for instance in 
([Witten I, section 2](#WittenI)). A detailed discussion is in ([GBMNV](#GBMNV)).

### Fivebrane in 11-dimensional supergravity

The [[worldvolume]] theory of the [[M5-brane]], the
[[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]], contains a self-dual 2-form field. Its [AdS7-CFT6 holographic](AdS-CFT#AdS7CFT6) description by 7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is due to ([Witten I](#WittenI)).

### RR-Fields in type II supergravity

The [[RR-field]] in [[type II string theory]] are self-dual (as a formal sum of fields). A holographic description is discussed in ([Belov-Moore II](#BelovMooreII)).
