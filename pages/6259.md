## Idea

The standard [[action functional]] for the [[higher U(1)-gauge field]] given by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $(P, \nabla)$ over a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|(pseudo)]] [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is 

$$
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star_g F_{\nabla}
  \,,
$$

where $F_\nabla$ is the [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form. If the [[dimension]] 

$$
  dim X = 4 k + 2 
$$

then the [[Hodge star]] operator squares to $+1$ (Lorentian signature) or $-1$ (Euclidean signature) on $\Omega^{k+1}(X)$. Therefore it makes sense in these dimensions to impose the _self-duality_ or _chirality_ constraint

$$
  \pm F_\nabla = \star F_\nabla
  \,.
$$

With this duality constraint imposed, one speaks of **self-dual higher gauge fields** or **chiral higher gauge fields** or **higher gauge fields with self-dual curvature**. (These are a higher degree/dimensional generalization of what in [[Yang-Mills theory]] are called [[Yang-Mills instanton]] field configurations.)

Since imposing the self-duality constraint on the fields that enter the above [[action functional]] makes that functional vanish identically, self-dual higher gauge theory is notorious for being subtle in that either it does not have a [[Lagrangian]] field theory description, or else a somewhat intricate indirect one (e.g. [Belov-Moore 06I](#BelovMooreI)). But instead one may regard the self-duality condition rsther as part of the quantum theory ([FMW 00b, page 3](#FMW00)), namely as a choice of [[polarization]] of the [[phase space]] of an unconstrained theory in one dimension higher. By such as "[[holographic principle]]" the [[partition function]] of the self-dual theory on an $X$ of dimension $4 k +2$ is given by the [[state]] (wave function) of an abelian  [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension $4 k + 3$.

The way this works is understood in much mathematical detail for $k = 0$, see at _[[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]]_. Motivated by this it has been proposed and studied in a fair bit of mathematical detail for $k = 1$ ([Witten 96](#WittenI), [[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology, and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 02]]), see at _[[M5-brane]]_ and _[[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]]_ and [AdS7/CFT6](AdS-CFT#AdS7CFT6). In both these cases the [[higher gauge fields]] are [[cocycle]]s in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. In ([FMW 00](#FMW00), [Belov-Moore II](#BelovMooreII)) it is suggested that similarly taking the self-dual fields to be cocycles in ([[differential K-theory|differential]]) [[complex K-theory]] produces the [[RR-fields]] of [[type II superstring theory]] in dimension 10.

## Properties

### Holographic relation to higher Chern-Simons theory

#### Idea and examples

Generally, [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]
in dimension $4k+3$ (for $k \in \mathbb{N}$) is [[holographic principle|holographically]] related to self-dual higher gauge theory in dimension $4k+2$ (at least in the abelian case). 

* $(k=0)$: ordinary 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] is related to a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] on its boundary;

* $(k=1)$: [[7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] is related to a [[fivebrane]] model on its boundary;

* $(k=2)$: [[11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] (of [[field (physics)|fields]] which are [[cocycles]] in ([[twisted differential K-theory|twisted differential]]) [[complex K-theory]]) is related to a parts of a [[type II string theory]] on its boundary (or that of the space-filling [[D9-brane]], if one wishes) ([Belov-Moore 06 II](#BelovMooreII)).


#### Conformal structure from polarization
 {#ConformalStructureFromPolarization}

We indicate why [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] is -- if holographically related to anything -- holographically related to [[self-dual higher gauge theory]].

The [[phase space]] of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in [[dimension]] $4k+3$ on $\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}$ can be identified with the space of [[curvature|flat]] $2k+1$-forms on $\Sigma$. The [[presymplectic form]] on this space is given by the pairing

$$
  (\delta B_1, \delta B_2) \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma \delta B_1 \wedge \delta B_2
$$

obtained as the [[integration of differential forms]] over $\Sigma$ of the [[wedge product]] of the two forms.

The [[geometric quantization]] of the theory requires that we choose a [[polarization]] of the [[complexification]] of this space (split the space of forms into "coordinates" and their "[[canonical momenta]]"). 

One way to achieve this is to choose a [[conformal structure]] on $\Sigma$. The corresponding [[Hodge star operator]]

$$
  \star : \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \to \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)
$$

provides the polarization by splitting into self-dual and anti-self-dual forms: 

notice that (by the formulas at [[Hodge star operator]]) we have on mid-dimensional forms

$$
  \star \star B = (-1)^{(2k+1)(4k+3)} B
  = - B
  \,.
$$

Therefore it provides a [[complex structure]] on $\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \otimes \mathbb{C}$.

We see that the symplectic structure on the space of forms can equivalently be rewritten as

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_X B_1 \wedge B_2
    & = - \int_X B_1 \wedge \star \star B_2 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here on the right now the [[Hodge star operator|Hodge inner product]] of $B_1$ with $\star B_2$ appears, which is invariant under applying the Hodge star to both arguments.

We then decompose $\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)$ into the $\pm i$-[[eigenspace]]s of $\star$: say $B \in \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)$ is  _imaginary self-dual_ if

$$
  \star B = i B
$$

and _imaginary anti-self-dual_ if

$$
  \star B = - i B
  \,.
$$

Then for imaginary self-dual $B_1$ and $B_2$ we find that the symplectic pairing is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (B_1, B_2)
    &=
    -i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
    \\
    & =
    -i \int_X (\star B_1) \wedge \star (\star B_2)
    \\
    & =    
    +i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
  \end{aligned} 
  \,.
$$

Therefore indeed the symplectic pairing vanishes on the self-dual and on the anti-selfdual forms. Evidently these provide a decomposition into [[Lagrangian subspace]]s.


Therefore a [[state]] of higher Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma$ may locally be thought of as a function of the self-dual forms on $\Sigma$. Under holography this is (therefore) identified with the [[correlator]] of a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] on $\Sigma$.

### Partition function
 {#PartitionFunction}

By the above discussion (...) the [[partition function]] of self-dual higher gauge theory is given by (a multiple of) the unique [[holomorphic section]] of a [[square root]] of the [[line bundle]] classified by the [[secondary intersection pairing]]. ([Witten I](#WittenI), [Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)).

### Fivebrane in 11-dimensional supergravity

The [[worldvolume]] theory of the [[M5-brane]], the
[[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]], contains a self-dual 2-form field. Its [AdS7-CFT6 holographic](AdS-CFT#AdS7CFT6) description by 7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is due to ([Witten I](#WittenI)).

### RR-Fields in type II supergravity

The [[RR-field]] in [[type II string theory]] are self-dual (as a formal sum of fields). A holographic description is discussed in ([Belov-Moore II](#BelovMooreII)) based on ([FMW 00](#FMW00)). A refined discussion of the required quadratic pairing is in ([DFM 09](#DFM09)).
