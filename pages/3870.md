A morphism $f:A\to B$ in a [[strict 2-category]] $K$ is an **isocofibration** if the corresponding morphism $B\to A$ in $K^{op}$ is an [[isofibration]].

In $Cat$, the isocofibrations are the functors which are injective on objects.  There they are the [[cofibrations]] in the [[canonical model structure on Cat]].  However, a general 2-category has two candidates for a canonical model structure, one involving the isofibrations and one the isocofibrations, and in general the two may not be the same.
