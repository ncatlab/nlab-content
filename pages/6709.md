## Idea

A family of [[characteristic class]]es that obstruct [[orientation]], [[spin structure]], [[spin^c structure]], etc.

Stiefel-Whitney classes have coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$, but via the [[Bockstein homomorphism]] they are lifted to [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]]es.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The _Stiefel-Whitney classes_ are [[characteristic classes]] $w_i \in H^{i}(B O(n), \mathbb{Z}_2)$ on the [[classifying space]] of the [[orthogonal group]] in [[dimension]] $n$, defined by

1. $w_0 = 1$ and if $i \gt n$ then $w_i = 0$;

1. for $n = 1$,  $w_1 \neq 0$;

1. for the inclusion $i : B O(n) \hookrightarrow B O(n-1)$ we have $i^* w_i^{(n+1)} = w_i^{(n)}$;

1. for the inclusion $i : B O(k) \times B O(l) \to B O(k+l)$ we have $i^* w_i = \sum_{j = 0}^i w_j \cup w_{i-j}$ (on the right the [[cup product]]).

One defines the _total Stiefel-Whitney class_

$$ 
  w := \sum_i w_i
$$

as an element in the [[cohomology ring]]. For this the cup product rule says that for $E_1, E_2$ two real [[vector bundles]], then 

$$
  w(E_1 \oplus E_2) = w(E_1) \cup w(E_2)
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Spanning the cohomology ring

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every class in $H^\bullet(B O(n), \mathbb{Z}_2)$ can be written uniquely as a polynomial in the Stiefel-Whitney classes. In fact the [[cohomology ring]] is the [[polynomial]] algebra over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the SW classes:

$$
  H^\bullet(B O(n), \mathbb{Z}_2)  
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}_2[w_1, \cdots, w_n]  
  \,.
$$

### Whitney duality formula

For $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^q$ an [[embedding]] of a compact manifold, write $\tau := T X$ for the [[tangent bundle]] and $\nu$ for the corresponding [[normal bundle]]. Then since

$$
  \tau \oplus \nu \simeq T \mathbb{R}^q
$$

and the class of the vector bundle on the right is trivial, the sum rule for the SW classes says gives the [[cup product]] duality

$$
  w(\tau) \cup w(\nu) = 1
  \,.
$$

### Relation to Chern-classes

If $E_{\mathbb{C}}$ is a complex [[vector bundle]] and $E_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the underlying real bundle then the second Stiefel-Whitney class is given by the [[first Chern class]] mod 2

$$ 
  w2(E_{\mathbb{R}}) = c_1(E_{\mathbb{C}}) \; mod 2
  \,.
$$

More generally, the SW classes are then given by the [[Chern character]]. See for instance [Milnor-Stasheff, p. 171](#MilnorStasheff).
