## Idea

A [[Lie groupoid]] is said to be _effective_ if its morphisms act locally freely, in a sense.

(Beware that this use of the term is entirely independent of "effective" in the sense of [[Giraud theorem|Giraud's axioms]], as discussed are [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]].)

## Definition

Let $X_\bullet = (X_1 \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y)$ be a [[Lie groupoid]]. Equivalently, let $X$ be a [[differentiable stack]] equipped with an [[atlas]] $X_0 \to X$.

Then given any element $f$ in $X_1$, hence given a [[morphism]] $f \colon x \to y$, it induces a [[germ]] of a local [[diffeomorphism]] $\tilde f \colon (X_0,x) \to (X_0,y)$ as follows: 

choose $U_x \subset X_0$ to be any [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ small enough such that the restricted [[source]] and [[target]] maps 

$$
  \array{
    X_1 \times_{X_0} U_x &\to& X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s|_U, t|_U}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{s,t}}
    \\
    U_x &\stackrel{}{\hookrightarrow} & X_0
  }
$$

are [[diffeomorphisms]]. Then define $\tilde f$ to be the germ $t \circ (s|_U)^{-1}$.

The Lie groupoid $X_\bullet$ is called _effective_ if this assignment of morphisms to germs of local diffeomorphisms is [[injective]].

This means that the [[action]] of the [[automorphism group]] at any point $x$ on the germ at $x$ is [[faithful action|faithful]].
