## Idea

The classical _fracture theorem_ is a fundamental result in [[homotopy theory]] which says that the study of [[homotopy types]] may be decomposed into that of [[rational homotopy types]] and [[p-complete homotopy types]] of [[p-local homotopy types]].

More precisely, for $p$ a [[prime number]] and $X$ a [[p-local homotopy type]], then $X$ is the [[homotopy fiber product]]

$$
  X \simeq X_{\mathbb{Q}} \underset{(X_p^\wedge)_{\mathbb{Q}}}{\times} X_p^\wedge
$$

of its [[rationalization]] $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ with its [[p-completion]] $X_p^\wedge$ over the rationalization $(X_p^\wedge)_{\mathbb{Q}}$of the $p$-completions. This originates around ([Bousfield-Kan 72](#BousfieldKan72)), for a modern review see ([May-Ponto, theorem 13.1.4](#MayPonto)).

The impact here is that by [[rational homotopy theory]] the rationalization $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is typically comparatively easy to understand, and so the fracture theorem gives a way to decompose the remaining hard part of study of [[homotopy types]] into that of $p$-local/$p$-complete spaces "one prime at a time".

Similar statements hold in [[stable homotopy theory]] for [[spectra]], in which case the homotopy pullback squares here are also known as **arithmetic squares** ([Sullivan 05](#Sullivan05), for a review see [Bauer, section 2](#Bauer)).



## Variants

In an [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] every [[stable homotopy type]] is canonically a cohesive/differential extension of its [[geometric realization of a cohesive homotopy type|geometric realization]] by way of a kind of fracture theorem involving the localizations induced by the [[shape modality]] and the [[flat modality]]: 

$$
  X \simeq \flat_{dR}\Sigma X   \underset{\Pi \flat_{dR}\Sigma X}{\times}  \Pi X
$$
