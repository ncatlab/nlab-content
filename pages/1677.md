Let $A$ and $B$ be algebraic theories. The category $[A,B]$ of **$(A,B)$-bimodels** and their homomorphisms is the category of $A$-models and homomorphisms in $B-mod^{op}$. An alternative description is that is a co-$A$-model in $B-mod$. Each such bimodel $M$ determines and is determined by a pair of adjoint functors

$$Hom_B(M,?) : B-mod \to A-mod$$

$$M\otimes_A ? : A-mod \to B-mod$$

Composition of such adjoint pairs yields a functor

$$?\otimes_B ? : [B,C]\times [A,B] \to [A,C]$$

The category $[A,A]$ has a unit object - it would be churlish not to overload our notation yet further by calling it $A$, corresponding to the fact that the free $A$-model on one generator has a canonical co-$A$-structure.
