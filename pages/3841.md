## Definition

An infinite [[cardinal]] $\kappa$ is a **regular cardinal** if it satisfies the following equivalent definitions:

* no [[set]] of cardinality $\kappa$ is the union of fewer than $\kappa$ sets of cardinality less than $\kappa$.  

* given a function $P \to X$ (regarded as a family $\{P_x\}_{x\in X}$) such that ${|X|} \lt \kappa$ and ${|P_x|} \lt \kappa$ for all $x \in X$, then ${|P|} \lt \kappa$.  

* the [[category]] $\Set_{\lt\kappa}$ of sets of cardinality $\lt\kappa$ has all [[colimits]] (or just all [[coproducts]]) of size $\lt\kappa$.  

A cardinal that is not regular is called **singular**.

## Examples

### Regular cardinals


* The first (infinite) regular cardinal is $\aleph_0 = {|\mathbb{N}|}$, because a set with cardinality less than $\aleph_0$ is a [[finite set]], and a finite union of finite sets is still a finite set.

* The [[successor]] of any infinite cardinal, such as $\aleph_1$, is a regular cardinal.  (This requires the [[axiom of choice]].)  In the case of $\aleph_1$, this means that a countable union of countable sets is countable.  Note that this implies that there exist arbitarily large regular cardinals: for any cardinal $\lambda$ there is a greater regular cardinal, namely $\lambda^+$.

* Sometimes it is convenient to allow finite cardinals to be considered regular.  In this case, the finite regular cardinals are precisely $0$, $1$, and $2$.  For $0$ this is vacuous; for $1$ it is because the union of an empty set of empty sets is empty; and for $2$ it is because the union of a [[subsingleton]] set of subsingleton sets is again a subsingleton.


### Singular cardinals

* $\aleph_\omega = \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \aleph_n$ is singular, more or less by definition, since $\aleph_n\lt\aleph_\omega$ and ${|\mathbb{N}|} = \aleph_0 \lt\aleph_\omega$.
