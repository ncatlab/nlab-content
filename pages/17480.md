## Idea

A _symmetric ring spectrum_ is a [[ring spectrum]] modeled as a [[symmetric spectrum]]. Equivalently this is a [[monoid object]] with respect to the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]], for symmetric spectra.
Morever, if we regard symmetric spectra as $\mathbb{S}_{sym}$-[[modules]], as discussed at _[[Model categories of diagram spectra]]_, then this, in turn, is equivalent to a $\mathbb{S}_{sym}$-algebra, where $\mathbb{S}_{sym}$ is the standard model of the [[sphere spectrum]] as a symmetric spectrum.

There is a [[model structure for ring spectra|model structure for symmetric ring spectra]] ([MMSS 00](#MandellMaySchwedeShipley01)) under which symmetric ring spectra represent genuine [[A-infinity rings]], and commutative symmetric ring spectra represent genuine [[E-infinity rings]]. This fact is one of the key motivation for passing from [[sequential spectra]] to the richer model of [[symmetric spectra]] (and possibly further to other [[highly structured spectra]] such as [[orthogonal spectra]] and [[excisive functors]]).

Despite all this, the component expression of the structure in a symmetric ring spectrum, in the fashion of _[[functors with smash product]]_, is rather straightforward, and directly analogous to the structure in a [[dg-algebra]]: essentially there is for all pairs of indices $n_1, n_2$ a pairing between the component spaces of the spectrum in these degrees

$$
  E_{n_1}\wedge E_{n_2}\longrightarrow E_{n_1 + n_2}
$$

such that this respects the given action of the [[symmetric groups]] and of [[suspensions]], and such that it is is [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]] in the evident way.

## Definition

Write $Top_{cg}^{\ast}$ for the [[category]] of [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological spaces]].

One minimal way to state the definition is as follows:

###### Definition

A **topological symmetric ring spectrum** $R$ is

1. a sequence of component spaces $R_n \in Top_{cg}^{\ast}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$; (the _component spaces_);

1. a basepoint-preserving continuous left [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on $R_n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. $\Sigma_{n_1}\times \Sigma_{n_2}$-equivariant morphisms (the _multiplication maps_)

   $$
     \mu_{n_1,n_2} 
     \;\colon\;
     R_{n_1} \wedge R_{n_2} \longrightarrow R_{n_1 + n_2}
   $$

   for $n_1, n_2\in \mathbb{N}$;

1. morphisms

   $$
     e_0 \;\colon\; S^0 \longrightarrow R_0
   $$

   $$
     e_1 \;\colon\; S^1 \longrightarrow R_1
   $$

such that
