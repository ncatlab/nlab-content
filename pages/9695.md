A _braided monoidal natural transformation_ is a [[natural transformation]] between [[braided monoidal functor]]s that respects the symmetric monoidal structure.

In fact, a braided monoidal natural transformation is the same as a [[monoidal natural transformation]] (as long as it goes between braided monoidal functors).
