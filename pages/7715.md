## Idea

For $G$ a geometric [[group]] (e.g. a [[topological group]] or [[Lie group]]) and $P \to X$ a $G$-[[principal bundle]], one says that $G$ is the **structure group** of $P$.

More generally, and less tautologically, if $V \to X$ is a $G$-[[associated bundle]] then one says that $V$ has **structure group** $G$.
