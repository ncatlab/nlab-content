## Some publications

In 

* [[Michael Atiyah]], _On the work of Edward Witten_, Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematics, Kyoto 1990 ([pdf](http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1990.1/Main/icm1990.1.0031.0036.ocr.pdf))

the following "influential papers" are listed as relevant for Witten receiving the [Fields Medal 1990](http://159.226.47.99:8080/general/prize/medal/1990.htm)

* _Supersymmetry and Morse theory_,  J. Differential Geom. Volume 17, Number 4 (1982), 661-692. ([Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437492))

  This discusses deformations of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] and how its supersymmetric ground states are related to the [[Morse theory]] of a deformation function. The way this supersymmetric quantum mechanics appears as the point-[[particle]] limit of the [[type II superstring]] is explained at the end of 

* _Global anomalies in string theory_, in W. Bardeen and A. White (eds.) _Symposium on Anomalies, Geometry_, Topology, pp. 61â€“99. World Scientific, 1985

Finally Atiyah's section 2 mentions

* (with [[Cumrun Vafa]]), _Eigenvalue inequalities for Fermions in gauge theories_, Comm. Math. Phys. 95 (1984) 257

## related $n$Lab entries 

* [[string theory]]

* [[Gromov-Witten invariants]], [[Rozansky-Witten invariant]]
