 {#FieldMedalWork}

In 

* [[Michael Atiyah]], _On the work of Edward Witten_, Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematics, Kyoto 1990 ([pdf](http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1990.1/Main/icm1990.1.0031.0036.ocr.pdf))

the following "influential papers" are listed as relevant for Edward Witten receiving the [Fields Medal in 1990](http://159.226.47.99:8080/general/prize/medal/1990.htm).

First of all

* _Supersymmetry and Morse theory_,  J. Differential Geom. Volume 17, Number 4 (1982), 661-692. ([Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437492))

  This discusses deformations of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] and how its supersymmetric ground states are related to the [[Morse theory]] of a deformation function. The way this supersymmetric quantum mechanics appears as the point-[[particle]] limit of the [[type II superstring]] is explained at the end of 

* _Global anomalies in string theory_, in W. Bardeen and A. White (eds.) _Symposium on Anomalies, Geometry_, Topology, pp. 61â€“99. World Scientific, 1985

which otherwise is on [[quantum anomalies]] in string theory, such as the [[Green-Schwarz anomaly]], etc.

Finally Atiyah's section 2 mentions

* (with [[Cumrun Vafa]]), _Eigenvalue inequalities for Fermions in gauge theories_, Comm. Math. Phys. 95 (1984) 257

Then 

* _Elliptic genera and quantum field theory_, Comm. Math. Phys. 109 (1987) 

  on the [[elliptic genus]]/[[Witten genus]] as the [[partition function]] of the [[type II superstring]]/[[heterotic superstring]]

And various articles on the foundations of [[topological field theory]] such as

* _On the structure of the topological phase of two dimensional gravity_ Nuclear Phys, B 340 (1990) 281

  on the [[topological string]] limit of the [[worldsheet]] 2d [[quantum gravity]] theory of the string

and

* _Quantum field theory and the Jones polynomial_, Comm, Math, Phys, 121 (1989) 351

  on the [[quantization]] of 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]], its [[Jones polynomial]] [[knot invariant]] [[quantum observables]] and its [[holographic principle|holographic]] relation to the quantization of the [[WZW model]] (the [[string]] propagating on a suitable [[Lie group]] [[manifold]]).
