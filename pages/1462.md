#Idea#

The coimage of a morphism is the notion [[duality|dual]] to its [[image]].

#Definition#

The **coimage** of a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ in a [[category]] $C$ is the [[image]] of the corresponding morphism in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.

## In terms of colimits ##

If $C$ has finite [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, then the coimage of a morphism $f : c \to d$ is

$$
  Coim f \simeq colim ( c \times_d c \stackrel{\to}{\to} c)
  \,.
$$

#Remarks#

* Morphisms for which image and coimage coincide are [[strict morphism]]s.
