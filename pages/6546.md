## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] equipped with a $G$-[[connection on a bundle]] $\nabla$ (for some [[Lie group]] $G$) and for $x \in X$ any point, the [[parallel transport]] of $\nabla$ assigns to each [[curve]] $\Gamma : S^1 \to X$ in $X$ starting and ending at $x$ an element $ hol_\nabla(\gamma) \in  G$: the [[holonomy]] of $\nabla$ along that curve.

The **holonomy group** of $\nabla$ at $x$ is the subgroup of $G$ on these elements.

If $\nabla$ is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] and the holonomy group is a proper subgroup $H$ of the [[special orthogonal group]], one says that $(X,g)$ is a manifold of _[[special holonomy]]_ .
