## Dirac cohomology

Jing-Song Huang (Shandong)
"Dirac cohomology and a formula for dimension of automorphic forms"
(MR13, 2:30pm as usual)
Abstract: Dirac cohomology is a new tool in representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. It enables us to generalize some classical theorems as well as to simplify the old proofs. We also obtain new results such as branching rules. In this talk we will explain how to use Dirac cohomology to sharpen a formula of Langlands on dimension of automorpic forms.
