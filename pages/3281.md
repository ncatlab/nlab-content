## Idea

A _stable model category_ is a 1-[[category]] structure used to present a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] in analogy to how a general [[model category]] encodes a general [[(∞,1)-category]].


## Defintion

A **stable model category** $C$ is

* a [[pointed category|pointed]] [[model category]]

* such that the [[loop space object]] functor $\Omega$ and the [[suspension object]] functor $\Sigma$, are inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(C)$:

  $$ 
    \Omega : Ho(C) \stackrel{\overset{\simeq}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\simeq}{\to}} : 
   Ho(C) : \Sigma
   \,.
  $$

## Properties

### Relation to stable $\infty$-categories

Stabilization of model categories is a model for the abstractly defined [[stabilization]] in [[(infinity,1)-category theory]] ([Robalo 12, prop. 4.15](#Robalo12)).

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a _stable model category_ that is in addition

* a [[simplicial model category]];

* a [[cofibrantly generated model category]];
* a [[proper model category]];

* with a [[set]] $S$ of [[compact object|compact]] generators;

then there is a chain of [[simplicial Quillen adjunction|sSet-enriched]] [[Quillen equivalences]]  linking $\mathcal{C}$ to the the [[spectrum]]-[[enriched functor category]] 

$$
  \mathcal{C} \simeq_Q A_S Mod \coloneqq Sp Cat(A_S, Sp)
$$

equipped with the [[global model structure on functors]],
where $A_S$ is the $Sp$-[[enriched category]] whose set of objects is $S$

###### Remark

An $Sp$-enriched category is a homotopy-theoretic analog of an [[Ab-enriched category]], which may be thought of as a many-object version of a [[ring]], a "[[ringoid]]". Accordingly, an $Sp$-enriched category is an $A_\infty$-ringoid. It is has a single object then (as a pointed category) it is an [[A-infinity algebra]].

Hence:

###### Corollary

If if in prop. \ref{ModuleProp} there is just one compact generator $P \in \mathcal{C}$, then there is a one-object $Sp$-enriched category, hence an [[A-infinity algebra]] $A$, which is the [[endomorphisms]] $A \simeq End_{\mathcal{C}}(P)$, and the stable model category is its [[category of modules]]:

$$
  \mathcal{C} \simeq_Q A Mod
  \,.
$$

This is  in ([Schwede-Shipley, theorem 3.1.1](#SchwedeShipley))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This may be thought of as a homotopy-theoretic analog of the [[Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem]] for [[abelian categories]].

###### Remark

One way to read this is that [[formal duals]] of presentable [[stable infinity-categories]] are a model for [[spaces]] in ("[[derived noncommutative geometry|derived]]") [[noncommutative geometry]].

=--


If $A$ is an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]], then this identifies the corresponding stable model categories with the [[model structure on unbounded chain complexes]].

This is ([Schwede-Shipley 03, theorem 5.1.6](#SchwedeShipley03)).
