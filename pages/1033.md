## Idea


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

In a [[category]] with [[zero object]], the **cokernel** of a [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ is the [[pushout]] $coker(f)$ in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}}
    \\
    0 &\to& coker(f)
  }
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

More explicitly, this characterizes the object $coker(f)$ as [[generalized the|the]] object (unique up to unique [[isomorphism]]) that satisfies the following [[universal property]]:

for every object $C$ and every morphism $h : B \to C$ such that $h \circ f = 0$ is the [[zero morphism]], there is a unique morphism $\phi : coker(f) \to C$ such that $h = \phi \circ i$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The notion of cokernel is [[duality|dual]] to that of _[[kernel]]_. A **cokernel** in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[kernel]] in the [[opposite category]] $\mathcal{C}^{op}$.

## Properties

### Exactness properties

* Taking cokernels is a [[right exact functor]] on arrow-categories.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

In the category [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]] the cokernel of a morphism $f : A \to B$ is the [[quotient]] of $B$ by the [[image]] (of the underlying morphism of [[sets]]) of $f$.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

More generally, for $R$ any [[ring]], this is true in the category $R$[[Mod]] of [[modules]]: the cokernel of a morphism is the quotient by its set-theoretic image.

###### Example

In the category [[Grp]] of general (not necessarily abelian) groups, the cokernel is instead the [[quotient group]] by the [[normal closure]] of the image.

The following example is by the very definition of _[[abelian category]]_.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

In an [[abelian category]] the [[coimage]] of any morphism $f$ is the cokernel of its [[kernel]]

$$
  coim(f) = coker(ker(f))
  \,.
$$
