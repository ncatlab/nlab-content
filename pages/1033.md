## Idea

In a [[category]] with [[zero object]], the **cokernel** of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ is the [[pushout]] $coker f$ in

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    0 &\to& coker(f)
  }
  \,.
$$

The concept cokernel is [[duality|dual]] to [[kernel]]. A **cokernel** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[kernel]] in $C^{op}$.

## Properties

### Characterization by quotients

* In the category [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]] the cokernel of a morphism $f : X \to Y$ is the [[quotient]] of $Y$ by the [[image]] of $f$.

* In the category [[Grp]] of general (not necessarily abelian) groups, the cokernel is instead the quotient by the [[normal closure]] of the image.

### Exactness properties

* Taking cokernels is a [[right exact functor]] on arrow-categories.

## Examples

* In an [[abelian category]] the [[coimage]] of any morphism $f$ is the cokernel of its [[kernel]]

  $$
    coim(f) = coker(ker(f))
    \,.
  $$
