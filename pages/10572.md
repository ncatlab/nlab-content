## Idea

The [[Cartan geometry]] induced by [[parabolic subgroup]] inclusions is called _parabolic geometry_.

>Parabolic geometries are Cartan geometries of type $(G, P)$, where $G$ is a semisimple Lie group and $P \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup. The corresponding homogeneous spaces $G/P$ are the so–called generalized flag manifolds which are among the most important examples of homogeneous spaces. Under the conditions of regularity and normality, parabolic geometries always are equivalent to underlying structures. ([Cap 05](#Cap05))
