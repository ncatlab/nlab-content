## Idea

The [[Cartan geometry]] induced by [[parabolic subgroup]] inclusions is called _parabolic geometry_.

>Parabolic geometries are Cartan geometries of type $(G, P)$, where $G$ is a semisimple Lie group and $P \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup. The corresponding homogeneous spaces $G/P$ are the so–called generalized flag manifolds which are among the most important examples of homogeneous spaces. Under the conditions of regularity and normality, parabolic geometries always are equivalent to underlying structures. ([Cap 05](#Cap05))

Parabolic geometries include [[conformal geometry]], [[projective geometry]], almost quaternionic structures, almost Grassmannian structures, hypersurface type [[CR structures]], systems of 2nd order ODEs, and various bracket-generating distributions. An example of a Cartan geometry that is not parabolic is [[Riemannian geometry]].

A key application of parabolic Cartan geometry is to the construction of curved generalizations of the [[BGG resolution]].

All parabolic geometries admit a fundamental curvature quantity called harmonic curvature $\kappa_H$, which is a complete obstruction
to flatness. The [[Weyl tensor]] is the specific instance of $\kappa_H$ in conformal geometry.
