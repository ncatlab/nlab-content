## Definition

Given a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{M}$ and a [[coalgebra]] $C$ in $\mathcal{M}$ denote by $\mathcal{M}^{C}$ ($ resp. {}^{C}\mathcal{M}$)
the category of right (resp. left) ${C}$-[[comodules]]; similarly for an algebra $E$, denote by ${}_E\mathcal{M}$ (resp. $\mathcal{M}_E$) the [[category of modules|category of left E-modules]]
(right $E$-modules). If the monoidal category is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] or there is instead an appropriate [[distributive law]], then there are extensions of this notation to [[bimodules]], [[bicomodules]], relative [[Hopf modules]], entwined modules etc. e.g. Write ${}_E\mathcal{M}^B$ for left-right relative $(E,B)$-Hopf modules where $E$ is a $B$-comodule algebra over a bialgebra $B$. 

Let $k$ be a commutative unital [[ring]], and let $\mathcal{M}$ be $k$-linear (in particular it has [[zero morphisms]]).

###### Definition

Given a [[coalgebra]] $C$ in $\mathcal{M}$, a left $C$-[[comodule]] $(N,\rho_N \colon N\to N\otimes C)$, a right $C$-comodule $(M,\rho_M \colon M\to C\otimes M)$, their __cotensor product__ is an object in $\mathcal{M}$ given by the [[kernel]]

$$
  N \Box M  
  \coloneqq
  \mathrm{ker} (\rho_N \otimes \mathrm{id}_M - \mathrm{id}_N \otimes \rho_M ).
$$

If [[equalizers]] exist in $\mathcal{M}$, this formula extends to a [[bifunctor]]

$$
   {}\Box = \Box^{C}  
  \colon
\mathcal{M}^{C} \times {}^{C}\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
  \,.
$$

If $B$ is a [[bialgebra]] in $\mathcal{M}$ and $E$ is a right $B$-comodule algebra then the same formula defines a bifunctor

$$
  \Box 
    \colon 
  {}_{E}\mathcal{M}^{B} \times {}^{B}\mathcal{M} \rightarrow
{}_{E}\mathcal{M}
  \,.
$$ 


## Properties

### Relation to tensor product

Let now $\mathcal{M}=({}_k\mathrm{Mod},\otimes_k)$ be the symmetric monoidal category of $k$-modules.

Let $D$ be another $k$-coalgebra, with coproduct $\Delta_C$.
If $D$ is [[flat module|flat]] as a $k$-module
(e.g. $k$ is a field), and $N$ a left $D$- right $C$-bicomodule,
then the cotensor product $N \Box M$ is a $D$-subcomodule of the [[tensor product]] $N \otimes_k M$. In particular, under the flatness assumption, if $\pi \colon D \rightarrow C$ is a surjection of coalgebras then $D$ is a left $D$- right $C$-bicomodule via $\Delta_D$ and $(\id \otimes \pi) \circ \Delta_D$
respectively, hence $\mathrm{Ind}^D_C \coloneqq D \Box^C -$
is a functor from left $C$- to left
$D$-comodules called the [[induced comodule|induction]] functor for left comodules from $C$ to $D$.

## References

Cotensor products in [[noncommutative geometry]] appear in the role of [[space of sections]] of [[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundles]] of [[quantum principal bundle]]s (which in affine case correspond to [[Hopf-Galois extensions]]). See e.g.

* [[Shahn Majid]], _Foundations of quantum groups theory_, 2nd extended edition, paperback, Cambridge Univ. Press 2000.

In [[Hopf algebra]] theory, cotensor products appear as early as in 

* [[John Milnor]], [[John Moore]], On the structure of Hopf algebras.  Ann. of Math. (2)  81  1965 211--264.

The authors mention that they learned the notion from Mac Lane who knew it earlier in more general contexts. 

A textbook account is in 

* [[Doug Ravenel]], section A1.1 of _[[Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_, 1986/2003

An important problem is that the cotensor product of bicomodules is in general (even for $\mathcal{M}={}_k\mathrm{Mod}$) *not associative*, even up to an isomorphism. 

Cotensor products play a prominent role in various treatments of [[Galois theory]] in [[noncommutative geometry]]; a particularly geometric approach is within a version of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] based on usage of monoidal categories, as sketched in
