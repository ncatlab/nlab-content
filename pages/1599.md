A real Lie group is **compact** if its underlying topological space is a [[compact space]]. Compact Lie groups have a very well understood structure theory. All maximal tori of a compact Lie group are conjugate by [[inner automorphism]]s. The dimension of a maximal torus $T$ of a compact Lie group is called a rank of $G$. The [[normalizer]] $N(T)$ of a maximal torus $T$ is determining $G$. The Weyl group $W(G)=W(G,T)$ of $G$ with respect to a choice of a maximal torus $T$ is the group of automorphisms of $T$ which are restrictions of inner automorphisms of $G$. The maximal torus is of finite index in its normalizer; the quotient $N(T)/T$ is isomorphic to $W(G)$. The cardinality of $W(G)$ for a compact connected $G$, equals the Euler characteristics of the homogenous space $G/T$ ("flag variety").
