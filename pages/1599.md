## Definition

A real [[Lie group]] is **compact** if its underlying [[topological group]] is a [[compact topological group]].

## Properties

Compact Lie groups have a very well understood structure theory. 

All [[maximal torus|maximal tori]] of a compact Lie group are conjugate by [[inner automorphism]]s. The dimension of a maximal torus $T$ of a compact Lie group is called a _rank_ of $G$. The [[normalizer]] $N(T)$ of a maximal torus $T$ determines $G$. The [[Weyl group]] $W(G)=W(G,T)$ of $G$ with respect to a choice of a maximal torus $T$ is the group of automorphisms of $T$ which are restrictions of inner automorphisms of $G$. The maximal torus is of finite index in its normalizer; the quotient $N(T)/T$ is isomorphic to $W(G)$. The cardinality of $W(G)$ for a compact connected $G$, equals the [[Euler characteristic]] of the [[homogeneous space]] $G/T$ ("[[flag variety]]").
