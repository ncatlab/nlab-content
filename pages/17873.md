## Idea

A **sufficiently cohesive topos** is a topos that has enough connected objects. This can be viewed as a strong form of cohesiveness in the context of [[William Lawvere|Lawvere's]] axiomatic approach to [[big topos|gros toposes]].

## Terminological preliminaries

Sufficient cohesion is a relative concept and requires minimally the presence of an [[essential geometric morphism]] $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$. Here we state it for an [[adjoint quadruple]] $p_!\dashv p^* \dashv p_* \dashv p^!:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{E}$ such that $p^!$ (and hence $p^\ast$) is [[fully faithful]] and $p_!$ preserves finite products.

This is called a 'cohesive topos' at [[cohesive topos]], and will be referred to as a _'weakly cohesive topos'_ in the present entry - a sufficiently cohesive topos in this context corresponds to the axiomatization of a 'gros topos' in Lawvere ([1986](#Law86)) where the concept was considered for the first time. 

A weakly cohesive topos is called _pre-cohesive_ if $p$ furthermore satisfies the [[Nullstellensatz]] i.e. the canonical map $\theta:p_\ast\to p_!$ is an epimorphism. This is the situation explored in Menni ([2014a](#Menni14a), [2014b](#Menni14b)).

A pre-cohesive topos that furthermore satisfies the _continuity principle_ that $p_1(X^{p^\ast(Y)})\simeq p_!(X)^{Y}$ for all $X\in\mathcal{E}$, $Y\in\mathcal{S}$, is called _'cohesive'_ in Lawvere ([2007](#Law07)) where the term 'sufficently cohesive' occurs for the first time though the essential results are already present throughout the 1990s ([1986](#Law86), [1992](#Law92), [1997](#Law99)).

## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn #Contractible_object}
###### Definition 
An object $X$ in a weakly cohesive topos $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$ is called _contractible_ if for every object $Y\in\mathcal{E}$: $p_!(X^Y)=1$. 
=--

+-- {: .num_rem}
###### Remark
In particular, a contractible is connected: $p_!(X)=p_!(X^1)=1$.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Sufficient_Cohesion}
###### Definition 
A weakly cohesive topos $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$ is called _sufficiently cohesive_ if the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ is contractible i.e. $p_!(\Omega^X)=1$ for every object $X\in\mathcal{E}$ or, in other words, if all power objects are connected. 
=--

+-- {: .num_rem}
###### Remark
Since in general, every object $X$ embeds into its power object $X\rightarrowtail\Omega^X$ it follows that in a sufficiently cohesive topos $\mathcal{E}$ every object embeds into a [[connected object]] i.e. $\mathcal{E}$ has _enough connected objects_.

Furthermore, since in a [[Cartesian closed category]] $X^{(Y\times Z)}\simeq(X^Y)^Z$ one sees that in a sufficiently cohesive topos power objects $\Omega^X$ are not merely connected but even contractible: $p_!((\Omega^X)^Z)=p_!(\Omega^{X\times Z})=1$ and hence it follows that in a sufficiently cohesive topos every object embeds into a contractible object.

Conversely, if every power object $\Omega^X$ embeds into a connected object then the power objects $\Omega^X$ will be connected themselves by proposition \ref{connected_retract} below since power objects are injective in general. Whence a topos is sufficiently cohesive iff every object embeds into a connected object iff every object embeds into a contractible object. The last formulation is taken as the definition of sufficient cohesion in Lawvere ([2007](#Law07)).

## Properties

+-- {: .num_proposition #connected_retract}
###### Proposition
In a weakly cohesive topos, retracts of connected objects are connected themselves.
=--

**Proof**. Let $X$ be a retract of $Y$ with $p_!(Y)=1$. Then $id_X$ factors as $X\rightarrowtail Y\to X$ and applying $p_!$ shows that $id_{p_!(X)}$ factors through the terminal object $p_!(Y)$. $\qed$

Since in general, injective objects $I$ are retracts of the objects $X$ that they embed into because such inclusions $I\rightarrowtail X$ factor through $id_I$ by injectivity, it follows that in a weakly cohesive topos _injective objects that embed into a connected object are connected_ themselves.
