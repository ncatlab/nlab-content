## Idea

A **sufficiently cohesive topos** is a [[topos]] that has enough connected objects in the sense that every object embeds into a [[connected object]].

This can be viewed as a strong form of [[cohesive topos|cohesiveness]] in the context of [[William Lawvere|Lawvere's]] axiomatic approach to [[gros toposes]].

## Terminology

Sufficient cohesion is a relative concept and requires minimally the presence of an [[essential geometric morphism]] $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$. Here we state it for an [[adjoint quadruple]] between toposes 

$$p_!\dashv p^* \dashv p_* \dashv p^!:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{E}$$

such that $p^!$ (and hence $p^\ast$) is [[fully faithful]] and $p_!$ preserves [[finite products]].

This (and $\mathcal{E}$ in particular) is called a 'cohesive topos' (over $\mathcal{S}$) at _[[cohesive topos]]_, and will be referred to as a _'weakly cohesive topos'_ in the present entry - a sufficiently cohesive topos in this context corresponds to the three axioms (0-2) for a 'gros topos' in Lawvere ([1986](#Law86)) where the concept of sufficient cohesion was considered for the first time. 

A weakly cohesive topos is called _pre-cohesive_ if $p$ furthermore satisfies the [[Nullstellensatz]] i.e. the canonical map $\theta:p_\ast\to p_!$ is an epimorphism. This is the situation explored in Menni ([2014a](#Menni14a), [2014b](#Menni14b)).

A pre-cohesive topos that furthermore satisfies the _continuity principle_ that $p_!(X^{p^\ast(Y)})\simeq p_!(X)^{Y}$ natural in $X\in\mathcal{E}$, $Y\in\mathcal{S}$, is called _'cohesive'_ in Lawvere ([2007](#Law07)) where the term 'sufficently cohesive' occurs for the first time although the notion is defined in a more restricted environment than the earlier papers (cf. Lawvere [1986](#Law86), [1992](#Law92), [1999](#Law99)).

## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn #Contractible_object}
###### Definition 
An object $X$ in a weakly cohesive topos $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$ is called _contractible_ if for every object $Y\in\mathcal{E}$: $p_!(X^Y)=1$. 
=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
In particular, a contractible object is connected: $p_!(X)=p_!(X^1)=1$.
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Sufficient_Cohesion}
###### Definition 
A weakly cohesive topos $p:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{S}$ is called _sufficiently cohesive_ if the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega\in\mathcal{E}$ is contractible i.e. $p_!(\Omega^X)=1$ for every object $X\in\mathcal{E}$ or, in other words, if all [[power object|power objects]] are connected. 
=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
Since in general, every object $X$ embeds into its power object via the singleton map $\{\}:X\rightarrowtail\Omega^X$ it follows that in a sufficiently cohesive topos $\mathcal{E}$ every object embeds into a [[connected object]] i.e. $\mathcal{E}$ has _enough connected objects_.

Furthermore, since in a [[Cartesian closed category]] $X^{(Y\times Z)}\simeq(X^Y)^Z$ one sees that in a sufficiently cohesive topos power objects $\Omega^X$ are not only connected but even contractible: $p_!((\Omega^X)^Z)=p_!(\Omega^{X\times Z})=1$ and hence it follows that in a sufficiently cohesive topos every object embeds into a contractible object.

Conversely, if every power object $\Omega^X$ embeds into a connected object then the power objects $\Omega^X$ will be connected themselves by proposition \ref{connected_retract} below since power objects are injective in general. Whence a topos is sufficiently cohesive iff every object embeds into a connected object iff every object embeds into a contractible object. The last formulation is taken as the definition of sufficient cohesion in Lawvere ([2007](#Law07)).
=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
Following Lawvere ([2007](#Law07)) we have defined only sufficiently cohesively _toposes_ but axioms of cohesions can be considered in the wider context of Cartesian closed [[extensive category|extensive categories]] or even merely [[distributive category|distributive categories]] as done in Lawvere ([1991](#Law91a), [1992](#Law92), [2007](#Law07)). In the latter context, the definition of sufficient cohesion as 'having enough connected' objects would be feasible but Lawvere ([1991](#Law91a), p.4) suggests that the definition should be strenghtened to demand that every object is the equaliser of a pair of maps between two connected objects.

## Properties

Let us first record some easy but useful facts concerning the interplay between connectedness and constancy.

Recall that in a category with a terminal object a morphism $c:X\to Y$ is called _constant_ if $c$ factors through the [[terminal object]] $1$:
$$X\overset{c}{\to} Y=X\overset{!_X}{\to}1\overset{c_\ast}{\to} Y\quad .$$

+-- {: .num_prop #constant_identity}
###### Observation
An object $X$ is a terminal object iff $id_X$ is constant.
=--

**Proof**. "$\Leftarrow$": By assumption $id_X=(id_X)_\ast\circ !_X$. Since $X$ has a point $(id_X)_\ast$ there exists for every object $Z$ at least one map $Z\to X$. Suppose then that $f$ is some map $Z\to X$:

$$f=id_X\circ f=(id_X)_\ast\circ !_X\circ f=(id_X)_\ast\circ !_Z\quad .$$

But the righthand side does not depend on $f$ hence it is the only map $Z\to X$. $\qed$

+-- {: .num_prop #constant_homotopy}
###### Observation
Let $X$ be an object in a weakly cohesive topos and $c:X\to X$ be a constant endomap such that $p_!(c)=p_!(id_X)$. Then $X$ is connected i.e. $p_!(X)=1$.
=--

**Proof**. Since by assumption $p_!(1)=1$, $p_!(c)$ and, accordingly, $p_!(id_X)=id_{p_!(X)}$ are constants. $\qed$

+-- {: .num_prop #connected_retract}
###### Observation
In a weakly cohesive topos, retracts of connected objects are connected themselves.
=--

**Proof**. Let $X$ be a retract of $Y$ with $p_!(Y)=1$. Then $id_X$ factors as $X\rightarrowtail Y\to X$ and applying $p_!$ shows that $id_{p_!(X)}$ factors through the terminal object $p_!(Y)$. $\qed$

Since in general, injective objects $I$ are retracts of the objects $X$ that they embed into because such inclusions $I\rightarrowtail X$ factor through $id_I$ by injectivity, it follows that in a weakly cohesive topos _injective objects that embed into a connected object are connected_ themselves.

In particular, _all_ injective objects are connected in a sufficiently cohesive topos. Since power objects are injective in general one gets the converse as well:

+-- {: .num_prop #sufficient_injective}
###### Proposition
A weakly cohesive topos is sufficiently cohesive iff all injective objects are connected. $\qed$
=--

## Cohesively connected truth

In a sufficiently cohesive topos the subobject classifier is obviously connected since $\Omega=\Omega^1$. It is the aim of this section to prove that in a weakly cohesive topos the converse holds as well: $\Omega$ is connected iff $\Omega$ is contractible.

Before embarking on a proof let us consider two examples that illustrate that the concept of sufficient cohesion results from the interplay between the _connectedness_ of the subobject classifier and the _exactness_ properties of the components functor $p_!$:

+-- {: .num_example}
###### (Non)examples
The [[Sierpinski topos]] $Set^\to$ is weakly cohesive over $Set$ since there exists a string of adjoint functors $L\dashv\Pi\dashv\Delta\dashv\Gamma\dashv B: Set\to Set^\to$ with 

* $L(Z)=\emptyset \to Z$

* $\Pi(X\to Y) = Y$

* $\Delta(Z)=Z\overset{id}{\to} Z$

* $\Gamma (X\to Y) = X$

* $B(Z)=Z\to 1$.

The Nullstellensatz fails as does the continuity principle. As a right adjoint $\Pi$ preserves all limits and the terminal object in particular whence $1$ is connected in $Set^\to$. Since the underlying category $\to$ satisfies the [[Ore condition]] trivially, it follows then from a general result[^bouquet] of Lawvere that $\Omega$ is not connected[^bouquet] and, accordingly, that the _Sierpinski topos is not sufficiently cohesive!_

On the other hand, the topos of [[quiver|quivers]] $Set^\rightrightarrows$ has a connected subobject classifier but lacks the right adjoint $B$ nor does its connected components functor $\Pi$ preserve finite products. $\qed$
=--

[^bouquet]: (Theorem 12.2.3 in La Palme Reyes et al. ([2004](#RRZ04), p.221)). Of course, this can also easily be proved directly or read off the concrete objects and properties worked out in La Palme Reyes et al (2004) where the Sierpinski topos is called the category of bouquets.

Recall that in any topos, the subobject classifier $\Omega$ has two points $\mathsf{true},\mathsf{false}$ fitting into the following pullback diagram (which is an equaliser diagram as well) due to the classifying property of $\Omega$ for the monomorphism $0\to 1$:

$$
\array{
0 &\to & 1 
\\
\downarrow & &\downarrow\mathsf{true}
\\
1 &\underset{\mathsf{false}}{\to} &\Omega
}
$$

In a sufficiently cohesive topos $\Omega$ is furthermore connected whence together with its [[Heyting algebra|Heyting algebra structure]] we can view it as a generalized (non linear) "interval" object:

+-- {: .num_defn #connector}
###### Definition 
An object $T$ in a weakly cohesive topos is called a _(cohesive) connector_ if $p_!(T)=1$ and $T$ has two points $t_0,t_1:1\to T$ with empty [[equaliser]]: $0\overset{e}{\to} 1\overset{t_0}{\underset{t_1}{\rightrightarrows}} T$.
=--

In a topos with a connected subobject classifier $\Omega$ itself is a connector. Conversely the existence of a connector implies the connectedness of $\Omega$:

+-- {: .num_prop #connecting_truth}
###### Proposition
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be weakly cohesive topos. $\mathcal{E}$ has a connector $T$ iff $p_!(\Omega)=1$.
=--

**Proof**.
"$\Rightarrow$": Let $1\overset{t_0}{\underset{t_1}{\rightrightarrows}} T$ be a connector. Then $t_1:1\to T$ is a subobject with classifying map $\chi_1:T\to\Omega$. Consider the two composites $\chi_1\circ t_i$ , $i=0,1$:

For $i=1$ this simply yields $\mathsf{true}$ by the definition of $\chi_1$.

For $i=0$ we claim that $\chi_1\circ t_0=\mathsf{false}$ since we have the following diagram:

$$
\array{
0 &\to & 1 &\to & 1 
\\
\downarrow & &t_1\downarrow& & \downarrow \mathsf{true}
\\
1&\underset{t_0}{\to} &T&\underset{\chi_1}{\to}&\Omega
}
$$

Here the left square is a pullback since $t_o,t_1$ have empty equaliser by assumption. The right square is a pullback since it classifies $t_1$ whence the outer square is a pullback too. Therefore $\chi_1\circ t_0$ classifies $0\to 1$ which is exactly the definition of $\mathsf{false}$. 

Since $p_!(T)$ is terminal $p_!(t_0)=p_!(t_1)$. Whence
$$p_!(\mathsf{true})=p_!(\chi_1\circ t_1)=p_!(\chi_1)\circ p_!(t_1)=p_!(\chi_1)\circ p_!(t_0)=p_!(\chi_1\circ t_0)=p_!(\mathsf{false})\quad$$

This says that $\mathsf{true}$ and $\mathsf{false}$ are in the same connected component but a lattice whose top and bottom elements are in the same component is necessarily connected. $\qed$

For the following the monoid structure of $\Omega$ will be capital. So let us briefly recall the basics:

In a general topos, the Heyting algebra structure endows the subobject classifier with the structure of an [[internal monoid]]: The multiplication is given by conjunction

$$\Omega\times\Omega\overset{\wedge}{\to}\Omega\quad ,
\text{ and the unit by }\quad\mathsf{true}\quad .
$$
Importantly, the other truth value $\mathsf{false}$ plays the role of a (multiplicative) _zero_ with respect to this multiplication.

One can use connectors to define a (generalized) homotopy relation between maps that behaves well under taking connected components.

+-- {: .num_defn #I-homotopy}
###### Definition 
Let $I$ be a connector. Two parallel maps $f,g:A\to B$ are called _I-homotopical_, in signs: $f\sim_I g$, if there exists a map $h:A\times I\to B$ with the property that
$$f=h\circ\langle id_A, t_0\circ !_A\rangle\quad and\quad g=h\circ\langle id_A, t_1\circ !_A\rangle\quad.$$
(In this case, $h$ is also called an (I-)homotopy between $f$ and $g$.)
=--

The following result brings together the two crucial ingredients for the equivalence between contractability and connectedness of $\Omega$, namely, the preservation of finit products by $p_!$ and $p_!(\Omega)=1$.

+-- {: .num_prop #homotopy_components}
###### Proposition
Let $f=h\circ\langle i, k_1\rangle$ and $g=h\circ\langle i, k_2\rangle$ be a pair of parallel maps in a weakly cohesive topos with the property that $p_!(k_1)=p_!(k_2)$. Then $p_!(f)=p_!(g)$. In particular, $f\sim_I g$ implies $p_!(f)=p_!(g)$.
=--

**Proof**. Since $p_!$ preserves finite products it maps product diagrams to product diagrams whence $p_!(h\circ\langle i, k_j\rangle)=p_!(h)\circ p_!(\langle i, k_j\rangle)=p_!(h)\circ \langle p_!( i), p_!(k_j)\rangle$ , $j\in\{1,2\}$, but these two maps coincide since $p_!(k_1)=p_!(k_2)$ by assumption.

Since for an I-homotopy $k_j=t_j\circ !_A:A\to I$ and, $p_!(I)=1$ by assumption, $p_!(k_j):p_!(A)\to 1$, $j\in\{1,2\}$, and these maps necessarily coincide since $1$ is terminal whence $p_!(t_0\circ !_A)=p_!(t_1\circ !_A)$ whence $p_!(f)=p_!(g)$ as claimed. $\qed$


In general, we can get a map $\mu:\Omega^X\times\Omega\to\Omega^X$ from the conjunction $\wedge :\Omega\times\Omega\to \Omega$ by the following steps:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Omega\times\Omega &\overset{\wedge}{\to}  \Omega
\\
\Omega& \to\Omega^{\Omega}\quad\text{by transposal}
\\ 
\Omega^X&\to (\Omega^{\Omega})^{X}\quad\text{applying the endofunctor (-)}^X
\\
\Omega^X &\to (\Omega^X)^{\Omega}\quad\text{by using rules for powers}
\\
\Omega^X\times\Omega&\overset{\mu}{\to}\Omega^X\quad \text{by reversing transposal .}
\end{aligned}
$$
