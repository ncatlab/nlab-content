#Definition#

A **ringed site** is a [[site]] $S_X$ equipped with a [[sheaf]] $O_X$ of [[ring]]s.

A morphism of ringed sites $(S_X, O_X) \to (S_Y, O_Y)$ is ...

#Examples#

* The archetypical and motivating class of examples is: $X$ a [[topological space]], $S_X = Op(X)$ the [[category of open subsets]] of $X$ with its standard [[Grothendieck topology]] and $O_X := C(-,\mathbb{R})$ the sheaf of continuous functions with values in (say) the real numbers.

* A [[supermanifold]] is a ringed site where $X$ is the underlying manifold, $S_X = Op(X)$ the [[category of open subsets]] $U$ of $X$ such that for each contractible $U$ $O_X(U) \simeq C^\infty(U) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \Lambda^\bullet V$ for $V$ a fixed finite dimensional vector space, $\Lambda^\bullet V$ its exterior algebra and the isomorphism being one of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading rings.
