## Idea

Arithmetic Chow groups are refinements of ordinary [[Chow groups]] analogous to how [[ordinary differential cohomology]] refines [[ordinary cohomology]].

Let $X$ be an [[arithmetic variety]], that is: a [[quasi-projective variety|quasi-projective]] [[flat scheme|flat]] [[regular scheme]] over an 
[[arithmetic ring]]. In ([Gillet-Soule](#GilletSoule)) the _arithmetic Chow groups_ of $X$, denoted $\hat CH^p(X)$, are defined as groups whose elements are [[equivalence classes]] of
pairs consisting of a codimension $p$ subvariety of $X$ together with a [[Green current]] for it. Later, in ([Burgos Gil 97](#BurgosGil97)), an alternative definition was given in terms of a [[Deligne complex]] of [[differential forms]] with logarithmic
singularities along infinity, that computes a version of [[ordinary differential cohomology]] groups. 

When $X$ is [[proper scheme|proper]], the two definitions are [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]].
