## Idea

Every [[category]] $C$ gives rise to an _arrow category_ $Arr(C)$ such that the [[objects]] of $Arr(C)$ are the [[morphisms]] (or _arrows_, hence the name) of $C$.


## Definition

For $C$ any [[category]], its **arrow category** $Arr(C)$ is the category such that:

* an [[object]] $a$ of $Arr(C)$ is a [[morphism]] $a\colon a_0 \to a_1$ of $C$;
* a [[morphism]] $f\colon a \to b$ of $Arr(C)$ is a [[commutative square]]
  $$ \array {
     a_0 & \overset{f_0}\to & b_0 \\
     \llap{a}\downarrow & & \rlap{b}\downarrow \\
     a_1 & \underset{f_1}\to & b_1
     } $$
  in $C$;
* [[composition]] in $Arr(C)$ is given simply by placing commutative squares side by side to get a commutative oblong.

Up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], this is the same as the [[functor category]]
$$
  Arr(C) := Funct(I,C) = [I,C] = C^I
$$
for $I$ the [[interval category]] $\{0 \to 1\}$.  $Arr(C)$ is also written $[\mathbf{2},C]$, $C^{\mathbf{2}}$, $[\Delta[1],C]$, or $C^{\Delta[1]}$, since $\mathbf{2}$ and $\Delta[1]$ (for the $1$-[[simplex]]) are common notations for the interval category.


## Properties

* $Arr(C)$ is the equivalently the [[comma category]] $(id/id)$ where $id\colon C \to C$ is the [[identity functor]].

* $Arr(C)$ plays the role of a directed [[homotopy|path object]] for categories in that functors
$$
  X \to Arr(Y)
$$
are the same as [[natural transformations]] between functors between $X$ and $Y$.
