## Idea

The _Hopf fibration_ (named after [[Heinz Hopf]]) is a canonical nontrivial  [[circle bundle]] over the [[2-sphere]] whose total space is the [[3-sphere]].

$$
  S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3 \to S^2 
$$

## Definition

### Homotopy-theoretic characterization
 {#HomotopyTheoreticCharacterization}

The [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2) \simeq B S^1$ is the [[classifying space]] for [[circle group]] [[principal bundles]]. By its very nature, it has a single nontrivial [[homotopy group]], the second, and this is isomorphic to the group of [[integers]]

$$
  \pi_2(K(\mathbb{Z},2)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

This means that there is, up to [[homotopy]], a canonical (up to sign), continuous map from the 2-sphere 

$$
  \phi : S^2 \to K(\mathbb{Z},2)
  \,,
$$

such that $[\phi] \in \pi_2(K(\mathbb{Z},2)) = \pm 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

As any map into $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ this classifies a [[circle group]] [[principal bundle]] over its [[domain]]. This is the Hopf fibration, fitting into the long [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\hookrightarrow& S^3
    \\  
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && S^2
    &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&
    B S^1 \simeq K(\mathbb{Z},2)
  }
  \,.
$$

In other words, the Hopf fibration is the $U(1)$-bundle with unit first [[Chern class]] on $S^2$.

### Explicit model

An explicit [[topological space]] presenting the Hopf fibration may be obtained as follows.

Identify

$$ 
  S^3 \simeq \{(z_0, z_1) \in \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C} \,|\, {|z_0|}^2 + {|z_1|}^2 = 1\}
$$

and

$$
  S^2 \simeq \{(z, x) \in \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R} 
  \,|\,
  {|z|}^2 + x^2 = 1\}
  \,.
$$

Then the [[continuous function]] $S^3 \to S^2$ given by sending

$$
  (z_0, z_1) \mapsto (2 z_0 z_1^* , {|z_0|}^2 - {|z_1|}^2)
$$

presents the Hopf fibration.

## Applications

When line bundles are regarded as models for the topological structure underlying the [[electromagnetic field]] the Hopf fibration is often called "the magnetic monopole". We may think of the $S^2$ homotopically as being the 3-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] with origin removed $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{0\}$ and think of this as being 3-dimensional physical space with a unit point [[magnetic charge]] at the origin removed. The corresponding [[electromagnetic field]] away from the origin is given by a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the corresponding Hopf fibration bundle.
