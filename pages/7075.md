## Idea

The _Hopf fibration_ (named after [[Heinz Hopf]]) is a canonical nontrivial  [[circle bundle]] over the [[2-sphere]] whose total space is the [[3-sphere]].

$$
  S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3 \to S^2 
$$

## Definition

### Homotopy-theoretic characterization
 {#HomotopyTheoreticCharacterization}

The [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2) \simeq B S^1$ is the [[classifying space]] for [[circle group]] [[principal bundles]]. By its very nature, it has a single nontrivial [[homotopy group]], the second, and this is isomorphic to the group of [[integers]]

$$
  \pi_2(K(\mathbb{Z},2)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

This means that there is, up to [[homotopy]], a canonical (up to sign), continuous map from the 2-sphere 

$$
  \phi : S^2 \to K(\mathbb{Z},2)
  \,,
$$

such that $[\phi] \in \pi_2(K(\mathbb{Z},2)) = \pm 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

As any map into $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ this classifies a [[circle group]] [[principal bundle]] over its [[domain]]. This is the Hopf fibration, fitting into the long [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\hookrightarrow& S^3
    \\  
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && S^2
    &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&
    B S^1 \simeq K(\mathbb{Z},2)
  }
  \,.
$$

In other words, the Hopf fibration is the $U(1)$-bundle with unit first [[Chern class]] on $S^2$.

### Explicit model

An explicit [[topological space]] presenting the Hopf fibration may be obtained as follows.

Identify

$$ 
  S^3 \simeq \{(z_0, z_1) \in \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C} \,|\, {|z_0|}^2 + {|z_1|}^2 = 1\}
$$

and

$$S^2 \simeq \mathbb{C P}^1 \simeq \mathbb{C} \sqcup \{\infty\}$$ 

Then the [[continuous function]] $S^3 \to S^2$ defined by  

$$(z_0, z_1) \mapsto \frac{z_0}{z_1}$$ 

gives the Hopf fibration. (Thus, the Hopf fibration is a circle bundle naturally associated with the canonical [[line bundle]].) Alternatively, if we use 

$$
  S^2 \simeq \{(z, x) \in \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R} 
  \,|\,
  {|z|}^2 + x^2 = 1\}
  \,.
$$

and identify this presentation of the 2-sphere with the complex projective line via [[stereographic projection]], the Hopf fibration is identified with the map  $S^3 \to S^2$ given by sending

$$
  (z_0, z_1) \mapsto (2 z_0 z_1^* , {|z_0|}^2 - {|z_1|}^2).
$$

### Homotopy-theoretic construction

See [[Hopf construction]].

## Variations 

For each of the [[normed division algebra|normed division algebras]] over $\mathbb{R}$, 

$$A = \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O},$$ 

there is a corresponding Hopf fibration of [[Hopf invariant one]]. The total space of the fibration is the space of pairs $(\alpha, \beta) \in A^2$ of unit norm: ${|\alpha|}^2 + {|\beta|}^2 = 1$. These gives spheres of dimension 1, 3, [[7-sphere|7]], and 15 respectively. The base space of the fibration is [[projective space|projective]] 1-space $\mathbb{P}^1(A)$, giving spheres of dimension 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively. In each case, the Hopf fibration is a map 

$$S^{2^n - 1} \to S^{2^{n-1}}$$ 

($n = 1, 2, 3, 4$) which sends the pair $(\alpha, \beta)$ to $\alpha/\beta$. 

## Applications

### Magnetic monopoles 

When [[line bundles]] are regarded as models for the topological structure underlying the [[electromagnetic field]] the Hopf fibration is often called "the [[magnetic monopole]]". We may think of the $S^2$ homotopically as being the 3-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] with origin removed $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{0\}$ and think of this as being 3-dimensional physical space with a unit point [[magnetic charge]] at the origin removed. The corresponding [[electromagnetic field]] away from the origin is given by a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the corresponding Hopf fibration bundle.

### K-theory

In complex [[K-theory]], the Hopf fibration represents a class $H$ which generates the [[cohomology ring]] $K_U(S^2)$, and satisfying the relation $H^2 = 2 \cdot H - 1$, or $(H-1)^2 = 0$. (So in particular $H$ has an [[inverse]] $H^{-1} = 2- H $, see at [[Bott generator]].) 

A succinct formulation of [[Bott periodicity]] for [[complex K-theory]] is that for a space $X$ whose [[homotopy type]] is that of a [[CW-complex]], we have 

$$K(S^2 \times X) \cong K(S^2) \otimes K(X)$$ 

(It would be interesting to see whether this can be proved by internalizing the (classically easy) calculation for $K(S^2)$ to the topos of sheaves over $X$.)

The Hopf fibrations over other [[normed division algebras]] also figure in the more complicated case of [[real K-theory]] $K_O$: they can be used to provide generators for the non-zero [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n(B O)$ for the [[classifying space]] of the [[stable orthogonal group]], which are periodic of period 8 (not coincidentally, 8 is the dimension of the largest normed division algebra $\mathbb{O}$). [To be followed up on.]
