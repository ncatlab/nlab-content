## Idea

What has been called _derived algebraic geometry_ by ([Kapranov](#Kapranov)), ([Toën-Vezzosi](#ToenVezzosi)), ([Lurie](#Lurie)) is [[higher geometry]] locally modeled on [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of commutative [[simplicial rings]], [[dg-algebras]] and generally [[E-∞ rings]], hence the [[derived geometry]] refinement of traditional [[algebraic geometry]].

More generally, one may consider a derived version of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] represented by [[A-∞ categories]] ([Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev](#KatzarkovKontsevichPantev)). 

Whereas "commutative" derived geometry over [[E-∞ rings]] is well described by [[(∞,1)-topos theory]], this is slightly insuficient for the noncommutative flavor.


## Motivation

The subject of  __derived algebraic geometry__ stem from two principal kinds of problems/programs 

1. to generalize the algebraic geometry allowing the notion of derived [[moduli space]]s (moduli stacks if you wish), which extend or replace the usual [[moduli space]]s. The classical moduli spaces are in some cases their truncations. Locally these moduli spaces should correspond to the deformation theory problem which geometrically 
realizes the [[cotangent complex]] for the deformation problem; 
the derived moduli spaces often exhibit smoothness which is lost
at the truncated level ([[hidden smoothness principle]]).

1. to study the part of the geometry of schemes captured cohomologically (by the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]]), which presents the kind of data very close to the interests of the classical Italian school; more generally a "derived" variety is defined as an $A_\infty$-category with certain good properties (analogues of proper, smooth etc.), Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold gives an example.   

## Idea of formalisms

The first motivation (capture cohomological information of a scheme) lead to replacing variety by a stable $(\infty,1)$-category of objects which generalize quasicoherent sheaves. The traditional variant are the enhanced triangulated categories or $A_\infty$-categories. This is usually
called [[derived noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

The second motivation (develop derived moduli spaces) is realized by creating spaces which are derived stacks, which are locally representable by commutative dgas. 

## History

### Some history for the derived moduli spaces

On the other hand there is a closely related effort to include sheaves of commutative [[dg-algebra]]s as [[structure sheaf|structure sheaves]] (dg-schemes of Kapranov, Ciocan-Fontaine, and [[Kontsevich]]) and more generally to allow [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured spaces]] of algebraic type, generalizing [[algebraic stack]]s, [[scheme]]s and [[algebraic space]]s. This is a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] version of [[algebraic geometry]]: its [[vertical categorification]] is also called derived algebraic geometry. Notice that in that sense, there is no loss of information in a passage from a scheme to its natural extension to a derived scheme. 

This second school has been, after the original ideas of Deligne, Drinfel'd and Kontsevich advanced by [[Carlos Simpson]] (who introduced also basic prerequisited like algebraic and geometric [[infinity-stack|n-stack]]s), and later [[Bertrand Toen]] and coworkers. One of the main motivations for both variants of derived algebraic geometry is to develop a satisfactory deformation theory and on its basis the theory of [[moduli stack]]s in [[algebraic geometry]] beyond the few examples which work in classical language of algebraic spaces and algebraic 1-stacks. 

Sometimes, but not always getting rid of limitations coming from 1-categorical truncations removes non-smoothness, but the expectations in that directions (hidden smoothness principle) failed in generality expected at the beginning. The construction of the derived moduli spaces relies, similarly to the classical moduli theory in algebraic geometry, on the infinitesimal case -- the [[deformation theory]] (cf. [[cotangent complex]]).

#### Remark. "Derived" in the second sense versus "$\infty$-"

The adjective "derived" means pretty much the same as the "$\infty$-" in [[∞-category]]. It stems from the use of "derived" as in [[derived category]] and [[derived functor]]. But incidentally, derived algebraic geometry is honestly [[higher category theory|higher categorical]], whereas derived categories and derived functors are really more like 1-categorical shadows of higher categorical structures, as described in detail at [[homotopy category]].
 
## relation to higher algebra ##

Where ordinary [[algebraic geometry]] uses [[algebra]] to describe [[geometry]], derived algebraic geometry uses [[higher algebra]]. Where ordinary algebraic geometry uses [[scheme]]s modeled on [[commutative ring]]s, derived algebraic geometry uses [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es modeled on [[E-∞ ring]]s  and noncommutative derived algebraic geometry models on A-infinity rings, but no topos theory is developed there. 


#Definitions#

## derived noncommutative geometry: stable $(\infty,1)$-categories ##

> details to be inserted here and harmonized with [[derived noncommutative geometry]]:

> Basic idea is to _identify_ [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[dg-category|dg-categories]], [[A-infinity category|categories]] and other models for [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable (∞,1)-categories]] with generalized "derived" spaces and to describe morphism between them in terms of [[geometric morphism]]s between these categories. It might be noteworthy that a (accessible) stable $(\infty,1)$-category is much like a (Grothendieck) [[(∞,1)-topos]]. See the definition below.

## structured $(\infty,1)$-toposes ##

In

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Structured Spaces]] 

a definition of [[derived algebraic scheme]] and [[derived Deligne-Mumford stack]] is given in the wider context of [[generalized scheme]]s realized as locally affine [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es.

See these links for more details.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark (derived scheme are $(\infty,1)$-toposes)

This definition is based on the observation that it is a deficiency of the ordinary definition of [[scheme]] to demand that underlying a scheme is a [[topological space]] and that a better definition is obtained by demanding it to have an underlying [[locale]]. But a [[locale]] is a [[0-topos]]. This motivates then the definition of a [[generalized scheme]] as a (locally affine, [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured]]) [[(∞,1)-topos]].

# Applications #

##Homological mirror symmetry##

Homological mirror symmetry is one of the main motivations and statements of the [[derived noncommutative algebraic geometry]] via $A_\infty$-categories, see there.

## Elliptic cohomology ##

More recent big success of derived algebraic geometry locally modeled on $E_\infty$-rings was [[elliptic cohomology]] and the construction and study of the [[tmf]] [[spectrum]] as a certain derived moduli  "of derived elliptic curves". This construction of moduli space is based on earlier Lurie result (not available in full) in which Lurie has proved an analogue of the Artin's representability theorem from the algebraic geometry of Grothendieck school. For more on that see

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]]

This formal aspect is supposedly related to the infinitesimal picture of the moduli stacks considered by Toen et al. and it generalizes more classical approaches to the [[deformation theory]] like Illusie's [[cotangent complex]] (cf. also [[perfect obstruction theory]] of Fantechi-Behrend).
