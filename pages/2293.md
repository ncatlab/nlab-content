Derived algebraic geometry is the [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] version of [[algebraic geometry]]: its [[vertical categorification]].

## "derived" versus "$\infty$-"

The adjective "derived" means pretty much the same as the "$\infty$-" in [[∞-category]]. It stems from the use of "derived" as in [[derived category]] and [[derived functor]]. But incidentally, derived algebraic geometry is honestly [[higher category theory|higher catgeorical]], whereas derived categories and derived functors are really more like 1-categorical shadows of higher categorical structures, as described in detail at [[homotopy category]].

There is no really systematic rule to the use of the word "derived" here. For instance [[derived stack]] has become the standard term for the general version of the notion of [[∞-stack]], but [[Higher Topos Theory]] is not called "derived topos theory".

> [[Urs Schreiber]]: personally I'd think that "derived algebraic geometry" is therefore a misnomer. But who am I to stop that train? :-)
 
## relation to higher algebra ##

Where ordinary [[algebraic geometry]] uses [[algebra]] to describe [[geometry]], derived algebraic geometry uses [[higher algebra]]. Where ordinary algebraic geometry uses [[scheme]]s modeled on [[commutative ring]]s, derived algebraic geometry uses [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es modeled on [[E-∞ ring]]s .


# Examples #

## elliptic cohomology ##

A major motivating example for the development of derived algebraic geometry was [[elliptic cohomology]] and the construction and study of the [[tmf]] [[spectrum]]. For more on that see

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]]
