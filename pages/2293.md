## Idea

Just as [[algebraic geometry]] is the study of [[spaces]] locally modelled on [[commutative rings]], _derived algebraic geometry_ is the study of [[spaces]] locally modelled on "derived commutative rings", which means either [[simplicial ring|simplicial commutative rings]], or equivalently when working over a base [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]], [[nonpositive|nonpositively]] [[graded]] [[dg-algebra|commutative dg-rings]].  The fundamentals of the subject have been developed by [[Bertrand Toen]] and [[Gabriele Vezzosi]], and by [[Jacob Lurie]].

In [[Grothendieck]]'s [[functor of points]] approach to the theory of [[schemes]], a [[scheme]] $X$ over a [[field]] $k$ is viewed as a [[functor]] from the [[category]] $CAlg_k$ of commutative $k$-[[commutative algebra|algebras]] to the [[category]] $Set$ of [[sets]], satisfying a [[descent]] condition.  Motivated by [[moduli problems]], people have enlarged the target category to the category $Grpd$ of [[groupoids]], arriving at the notion of a [[stack]].  [[Carlos Simpson]] extended this further by replacing $Grpd$ by the category $SSet$ of [[simplicial sets]], arriving at the notion of [[higher stacks]].  Derived algebraic geometry may be viewed as a further step in this progression, replacing the _source_ category $CAlg_k$ by $SAlg_k$, the category of [[simplicial algebra|simplicial commutative k-algebras]].  This is motivated by classical concerns involving [[intersection theory]] and [[deformation theory]], see below.

Sometimes the term _derived algebraic geometry_ is also used for the related subject of [[spectral algebraic geometry]], where [[E-infinity rings]] are used instead of [[simplicial rings]].  _Derived algebraic geometry_ may also refer to the study of [[derived categories of coherent sheaves]] on [[varieties]] as studied in [[derived noncommutative algebraic geometry|noncommutative algebraic geometry]], where one replaces a [[scheme]] $X$ by its [[triangulated category of perfect complexes]].

## Motivation

There are several motivations for the study of derived algebraic geometry.

1.  The [[hidden smoothness principle]] of [[Maxim Kontsevich]], which conjectures that in classical [[algebraic geometry]], the non-[[smoothness]] of certain [[moduli spaces]] is a consequence of the fact that they are in fact truncations of [[derived moduli stacks]] (which are [[smooth]]).

1.  Universal [[elliptic cohomology]] ([[topological modular forms]]).  See [below](#elliptic_cohomology_29).

1.  [[Intersection theory]]: a [[geometric]] interpretation of the [[Serre intersection formula]] for non-[[flat]] [[intersections]].

1.  [[Deformation theory]]: a [[geometric]] interpretation of the [[cotangent complex]].  (In derived algebraic geometry, the [[cotangent complex]] $\mathbf{L}_X$ of $X$ _is_ its [[cotangent space]].

For more detail on the final two points, see [(Vezzosi, 2011)](#VezzosiWhatIs).

## History

The original approach to derived algebraic geometry was via [[dg-schemes]], introduced by [[Maxim Kontsevich]].  Using [[dg-schemes]], [[Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine]] and [[Mikhail Kapranov]] constructed the first [[derived moduli spaces]] (derived [[Hilbert scheme]] and derived [[Quot scheme]]).

[[Bertrand Toen]] and [[Gabriele Vezzosi]] developed [[homotopical algebraic geometry]], which is [[algebraic geometry]] in any [[HAG context]], i.e. over any [[symmetric monoidal model category]] satisfying certain assumptions.  As special cases they recover the [[algebraic geometry]] of [[Grothendieck]] and the [[higher stacks]] of [[Carlos Simpson]], and also develop new theories of [[derived algebraic geometry]], [[complicial algebraic geometry]], and [[brave new algebraic geometry]].

In his thesis [[Jacob Lurie]] also developed fundamentals of derived algebraic geometry, using the language of [[structured (infinity,1)-toposes]] where [[Bertrand Toen|Toen]]-[[Gabriele Vezzosi|Vezzosi]] used [[model toposes]].  He also developed a version of derived algebraic geometry which is locally modelled on [[E-∞ rings]], called [[spectral algebraic geometry]].
 
## Terminology "derived" versus "$\infty$-"

The adjective "derived" means pretty much the same as the "$\infty$-" in [[∞-category]], so this is higher algebraic geometry in the sense being locally represented by higher algebras. The word stems from the use of "derived" as in [[derived functor]]. This came from the study of derived moduli problem. Namely to parametrize the moduli, one first looks at some space of "cochains" which are candidates for structures to parametrize. then one cuts those which indeed satisfy the axioms ("equations") for the structures. Satisfying these equations is a limit-type construction, hence left exact and one is lead to right derived functors to improve;
exactness on the right; this leads to use cochain complexes.
The obtained moduli is too big as there are many isomorphic structures, so one needs to quotient by the automorphisms; this is a colimit type construction hence right exact. The improved quotient is the left derived functor, what is obtained by passing to stacks. 


## Definitions

### structured $(\infty,1)$-toposes ##

In [Lurie, Structured spaces](#LurieStructured) a definition of [[derived algebraic scheme]] and [[derived Deligne-Mumford stack]] is given in the wider context of [[generalized scheme]]s realized as locally affine [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es.

See these links for more details.

###### Remark (derived scheme are $(\infty,1)$-toposes)

This definition is based on the observation that it is a deficiency of the ordinary definition of [[scheme]] to demand that underlying a scheme is a [[topological space]] and that a better definition is obtained by demanding it to have an underlying [[locale]]. But a [[locale]] is a [[0-topos]]. This motivates then the definition of a [[generalized scheme]] as a (locally affine, [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured]]) [[(∞,1)-topos]].

## Relation to derived noncommutative geometry
 {#RelationToDerivedNoncommutativeGeometry}

Under some conditions, [[derived schemes]] $X$ in the sense of ([[Structured Spaces|Lurie, Structured Spaces]]) are faithfully encoded by their [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] $QCoh(X)$ of [[quasicoherent sheaves]]. This is the content of [[Tannaka duality for geometric stacks]], ([[Quasi-Coherent Sheaves and Tannaka Duality Theorems|Lurie, Quasi-Coherent Sheaves and Tannaka Duality Theorems]]). Therefore one can turn this around and declare that a suitable [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{A}$ which is not of the form $QCoh(X)$ for an actual [[derived scheme]] $X$ represents a generalized, "noncommutative" derived scheme. This is much like a [[2-category theory]] or rather [[(∞,2)-category]] theory analog of how in [[algebraic geometry]] the opposite of the category of [[monoids]] (algebras) is regarded as a category of generalized spaces.

Accordingly, one can decide to regard the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] of suitable (e.g. [[monoidal (∞,1)-category|monoidal]]) [[stable (∞,1)-categories]]  as being a category of "noncommutative derived schemes". This is effectively the perspective on [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] that [[Maxim Kontsevich]] has been promoting.

Often and traditionally, all this is expressed in terms of certain presentations for these [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] by [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[derived categories]] or better, [[dg-enhancement|enhancements]] as [[dg-categories]].

In this fashion then in [[derived noncommutative algebraic geometry]], a [[space]] is by definition a [[dg-category]] that is smooth and proper in an appropriate sense.  The relation between [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and [[derived algebraic geometry]] may then be summed up by the adjunction
  $$ Pf : \DSt(k)^{op} \rightleftarrows NCSp(k) : \mathcal{M}_- $$
where $Pf(X)$ denotes the [[dg-category]] of [[perfect complexes]] on the [[derived stack]] $X$, and $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$ denotes the [[derived moduli stack of objects in a dg-category|derived moduli stack of objects]] in the [[dg-category]] $\mathcal{C}$.  See [[derived moduli stack of objects in a dg-category]] for details.

## Applications 

### Elliptic cohomology

More recent big success of derived algebraic geometry locally modeled on $E_\infty$-rings was [[elliptic cohomology]] and the construction and study of the [[tmf]] [[spectrum]] as a certain derived moduli  "of derived elliptic curves". This construction of moduli space is based on earlier Lurie result (not available in full) in which Lurie has proved an analogue of the Artin's representability theorem from the algebraic geometry of Grothendieck school.
