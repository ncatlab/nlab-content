## Idea

Just as [[algebraic geometry]] is the study of [[spaces]] locally modelled on [[commutative rings]], _derived algebraic geometry_ is the study of [[spaces]] locally modelled on "derived commutative rings", which means either [[simplicial ring|simplicial commutative rings]] (or equivalently when working over a base [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]], [[dg-algebra|commutative dg-rings]]), or [[E-∞ rings]].  The former approach has been developed by [[Bertrand Toen]] and [[Gabriele Vezzosi]], and the latter by [[Jacob Lurie]].  Both are known to be equivalent, up to some minor differences.

In [[Grothendieck]]'s [[functor of points]] approach to the theory of [[schemes]], a [[scheme]] $X$ over a [[field]] $k$ is viewed as a kind of [[functor]] from the [[category]] $CAlg_k$ of commutative $k$-[[commutative algebra|algebras]] to the [[category]] $Set$ of [[sets]].  Motivated by [[moduli problems]], people have enlarged the target category to the category $Grpd$ of [[groupoids]], arriving at the notion of a [[stack]].  [[Carlos Simpson]] extended this further by replacing $Grpd$ by the category $SSet$ of [[simplicial sets]], arriving at the notion of [[higher stacks]].  Derived algebraic geometry may be viewed as the next step in this natural progression, replacing the _source_ category $CAlg_k$ by $SAlg_k$, the category of [[simplicial algebra|simplicial commutative k-algebras]], or by the category of [[E-∞ rings]].  Hence a [[derived stack]] over $k$ is a kind of functor

$$ X : SAlg_k \to SSet. $$

The term _derived algebraic geometry_ sometimes also refers to the study of [[derived categories of coherent sheaves]] on [[varieties]] ([[Alexei Bondal]], [[Dmitri Orlov]], ...).  This is related to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and to [[derived noncommutative algebraic geometry]], where one replaces a [[scheme]] $X$ by its [[triangulated category of perfect complexes]] (or [[derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves]]) or a [[stable (∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categorical]] [[DG enhancement|enhancement]] thereof.

## Motivation

There are several motivations for the study of derived algebraic geometry.

1.  The [[hidden smoothness principle]] of [[Maxim Kontsevich]], which conjectures that in classical [[algebraic geometry]], the non-[[smoothness]] of certain [[moduli spaces]] is a consequence of the fact that they are in fact truncations of [[derived moduli stacks]] (which are [[smooth]]).

1.  Universal [[elliptic cohomology]] ([[topological modular forms]]).  See [below](#elliptic_cohomology_29).

1.  [[Intersection theory]]: a [[geometric]] interpretation of the [[Serre intersection formula]] for non-[[flat]] [[intersections]].

1.  [[Deformation theory]]: a [[geometric]] interpretation of the [[cotangent complex]].  (In derived algebraic geometry, the [[cotangent complex]] $\mathbf{L}_X$ of $X$ _is_ its [[cotangent space]].

For more detail on the final two points, see [(Vezzosi, 2011)](#VezzosiWhatIs).

## History

The original approach to derived algebraic geometry was via [[dg-schemes]], introduced by [[Maxim Kontsevich]].  Using [[dg-schemes]], [[Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine]] and [[Mikhail Kapranov]] constructed the first [[derived moduli spaces]] (derived [[Hilbert scheme]] and derived [[Quot scheme]]).

[[Bertrand Toen]] and [[Gabriele Vezzosi]] developed [[homotopical algebraic geometry]], which is [[algebraic geometry]] in any [[HAG context]], i.e. over any [[symmetric monoidal model category]] satisfying certain assumptions.  As special cases they recover the [[algebraic geometry]] of [[Grothendieck]] and the [[higher stacks]] of [[Carlos Simpson]], and also develop new theories of [[derived algebraic geometry]], [[complicial algebraic geometry]], and [[brave new algebraic geometry]].

[[Jacob Lurie]] developed a version of derived algebraic geometry which is locally modelled on [[E-∞ rings]].  The derived algebraic geometries of Toen-Vezzosi and of Lurie turn out to be equivalent, up to minor differences.  Their approaches differ in that the former is based on [[homotopy theory]], in the sense that it uses the language of [[model toposes]], while the latter is based on [[higher category theory]] and uses the language of [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es.
 
## Terminology "derived" versus "$\infty$-"

The adjective "derived" means pretty much the same as the "$\infty$-" in [[∞-category]], so this is higher algebraic geometry in the sense being locally represented by higher algebras. The word stems from the use of "derived" as in [[derived functor]]. This came from the study of derived moduli problem. Namely to parametrize the moduli, one first looks at some space of "cochains" which are candidates for structures to parametrize. then one cuts those which indeed satisfy the axioms ("equations") for the structures. Satisfying these equations is a limit-type construction, hence left exact and one is lead to right derived functors to improve;
exactness on the right; this leads to use cochain complexes.
The obtained moduli is too big as there are many isomorphic structures, so one needs to quotient by the automorphisms; this is a colimit type construction hence right exact. The improved quotient is the left derived functor, what is obtained by passing to stacks. 


## Definitions

### structured $(\infty,1)$-toposes ##

In [Lurie, Structured spaces](#LurieStructured) a definition of [[derived algebraic scheme]] and [[derived Deligne-Mumford stack]] is given in the wider context of [[generalized scheme]]s realized as locally affine [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es.

See these links for more details.

###### Remark (derived scheme are $(\infty,1)$-toposes)

This definition is based on the observation that it is a deficiency of the ordinary definition of [[scheme]] to demand that underlying a scheme is a [[topological space]] and that a better definition is obtained by demanding it to have an underlying [[locale]]. But a [[locale]] is a [[0-topos]]. This motivates then the definition of a [[generalized scheme]] as a (locally affine, [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured]]) [[(∞,1)-topos]].

## Relation to derived noncommutative geometry
 {#RelationToDerivedNoncommutativeGeometry}

Under some conditions, [[derived schemes]] $X$ in the sense of ([[Structured Spaces|Lurie, Structured Spaces]]) are faithfully encoded by their [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] $QCoh(X)$ of [[quasicoherent sheaves]]. This is the content of [[Tannaka duality for geometric stacks]], ([[Quasi-Coherent Sheaves and Tannaka Duality Theorems|Lurie, Quasi-Coherent Sheaves and Tannaka Duality Theorems]]). Therefore one can turn this around and declare that a suitable [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{A}$ which is not of the form $QCoh(X)$ for an actual [[derived scheme]] $X$ represents a generalized, "noncommutative" derived scheme. This is much like a [[2-category theory]] or rather [[(∞,2)-category]] theory analog of how in [[algebraic geometry]] the opposite of the category of [[monoids]] (algebras) is regarded as a category of generalized spaces.

Accordingly, one can decide to regard the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] of suitable (e.g. [[monoidal (∞,1)-category|monoidal]]) [[stable (∞,1)-categories]]  as being a category of "noncommutative derived schemes". This is effectively the perspective on [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] that [[Maxim Kontsevich]] has been promoting.

Often and traditionally, all this is expressed in tersm of certain presentations for these [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] by [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[derived categories]].

In this fashion then in [[derived noncommutative algebraic geometry]], a [[space]] is by definition a [[triangulated category]] which is smooth and proper in an appropriate sense.  Given a [[scheme]] $X$ of [[finite type]] over a [[field]], it has an associated noncommutative space $Pf(X)$ which is its [[triangulated categories of sheaves|triangulated category of perfect complexes]].  $Pf(X)$ admits a [[generator]] $E$, and is equivalent to the category $Pf(A-Mod)$ of [[perfect]] [[dg-modules]] over the [[dg-algebra]] $A = RHom(E, E)$.
Hence one may associate to $X$ the [[spectrum]] of this [[dg-algebra]], which is an [[affine]] [[derived scheme]] (when working over [[characteristic zero]]).
In this way the [[spaces]] of [[derived noncommutative geometry]] that come from commutative [[schemes]] can indeed be viewed as [[derived schemes]].

## Applications 

### Elliptic cohomology

More recent big success of derived algebraic geometry locally modeled on $E_\infty$-rings was [[elliptic cohomology]] and the construction and study of the [[tmf]] [[spectrum]] as a certain derived moduli  "of derived elliptic curves". This construction of moduli space is based on earlier Lurie result (not available in full) in which Lurie has proved an analogue of the Artin's representability theorem from the algebraic geometry of Grothendieck school.
