The _simplicial nerve_ is a [[nerve]] operation of [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]] which sends an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] to a [[simplicial set]].

...

#Remarks#

* The simplicial nerve, together with its [[left adjoint]] serves to relate the two models of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] given by [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] and [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]].

For the role played by the simplicial nerve in the context for relating quasi-categories to simplicially enriched categories as models for $(\infty,1)$-categories see section 1.1.5 of
