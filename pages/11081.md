## **Differentiation**
 {#Differentiation}


So far we have dealt with _cohesive_ structures for which there is a notion of _smooth variation_, say of the position of a [[particle]] along a [[trajectory]] in [[spacetime]]. The idea of _differentiation_ is to measure the _[[difference]]_ between the position of two points on a cohesive trajectory in space as the difference between their [[worldline]] coordinates "tends to 0" without actually becoming 0. One also says that differentiation is forming "[[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] differences" of a cohesive process -- and we will make precise here what this means.

There are two stages to the theory of differentiation:

1. We may think of differentiation as just a means to analyze more in detail the [[cohesive topos|cohesive structure]] already given, without adding new [[structure]], hence without a priori refining our notion of what a "[[cohesion|cohesive]] [[trajectory]]" is. Indeed, given any [[line object]] $\mathbb{R}$ in a [[cohesive ∞-topos]], there is a canonically a homomorphism of cohesive spaces

   $$
      \mathbf{d} \colon \mathbb{R} \to \Omega^1_{cl}(-,\mathbb{R})
   $$

   from the line to the cohesive moduli space of closed [[differential 1-forms]], which is such that it sends a cohesive curve on the line to the differential form on this curve whose value at each point is the _differential_ of the curve, its rate of infinitesimal change at that point.

   Below in _[Differentiation of smooth functions and differetial forms](#DifferentiationOfSmoothFunctionsAndDifferentialForms)_ we discuss this construction in the standard model of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth cohesion]] for [[smooth spaces]], where it reproduces what traditionally is called the _[[de Rham differential]]_ $\mathbf{d}$. 

   Further below in _[Maurer-Cartan forms -- Cohesive differentiation](#CohesiveDifferentiation)_ we show how $\mathbf{d}$ comes out from just the abstract axioms of cohesionn.

1. We may think of differentiation as reflecting a refinement of smooth cohesion such that [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] cohesive trajectories actually exist. Here, on top of having a _measure_ for how a cohesive trajectory changes infinitesimally at a given point, it makes sense to ask concretely if two points on a trajectory are infinitesimally close to each other. In this approach the very notion of cohesion is refined to include _explicitly_ a way to speak not just about a "cohesive blob of points", but to decide whether it is in fact just an "infinitesimal cohesive blob of points" -- an _[[infinitesimally thickened point]]_.

   [[differential geometry|Differential geometry]] with such an explicit notion of [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimals]] is known as _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_: the [[axioms]] here allow one to _synthesize_ an [[infinitesimally thickened point]] and not just to reason about it _as if_ it existed. 

   In such a synthetic differential context then the differential $\mathbf{d}$ from above not just exists as a whole, but we can "take it apart and re-synthesize it" by realizing its value at each point literally as the ordinary [[difference]] between two _infinitesimally close_ points. Similarly, various other fundamental constructions in [[differential geometry]], such as that of [[tangent bundles]] and [[jet bundles]] have a usefully transparent axiomatic characterization in the presence of synthetic infinitesimals. ([[Sophus Lie]], one of the founding fathers of [[differential geometry]] [famously said](synthetic+differential+geometry#SophusLieQuote) that he indeed found his theorems using such synthetic reasoning intuitively, and just did not publish them this way due to a lack of formalization of this language -- at his time. ) This we discuss in the Mod Layer in _[D-geometry](#DGeometry)_ below.

In the [Differentiation semantic layer](#DifferentiationLayerSem) below we formalize differentiation, and these two aspects of it, by adding to the notion of _[[cohesive topos]]_ that of an _[[infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood]]_.

Recalling that a [[cohesive topos]] is an abstract _cohesive blob_, an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood is accordingly an infinitesimally thicked cohesive blob (which is itself again a cohesive blob):


$$
  \array{
    CohesiveBlob &&\hookrightarrow&& InfinitesimallyThickenedCohesiveBlob
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && Point
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;

### Model Layer
 {#DifferentiationLayerMod}

We discuss 

* [Differentiation of smooth functions and differential forms](#DifferentiationOfSmoothFunctionsAndDifferentialForms)

  * first just _[on coordinate patches](#DifferentiationOnCoordinatePatches)_

  * and then _[on general smooth spaces](#DifferentiationOnSmoothSpaces)_.

By considering [[fiber products]] of smooth [[mapping spaces]] with [[discrete spaces]] of boundary configurations, we obtain from this the differentiation theory called 

* _[Variational calculus](#VariationalCalculus)_

  * with the notion of _[Smooth functional](#SmoothFunctionals)_

  * and _[Variational derivative](#FunctionalDerivative)_ of smooth functionals.

  * The central class of examples of this of interest in physics is the variation of [[action functionals]] that yields the [[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]] in [[classical field theory]]. This we discuss in _[Euler-Lagrange equations](#EulerLagrangeEquations)_.

#### Differentiation of smooth functions and differential forms
 {#DifferentiationOfSmoothFunctionsAndDifferentialForms}

##### Differentiation on coordinate patches
 {#DifferentiationOnCoordinatePatches}

By definition to [[smooth function]] $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is associated its [[derivative]], a smooth function $f' \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. And more generally to a smooth function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ are associated its [[partial derivatives]], smooth functions

$$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}
$$

for $1 \leq i \leq n $.

The [[de Rham differential]] collects all partial derivatives of a function into a single [[differential 1-form]]

+-- {: .num_defn #DeRhamDifferentialOn1Forms}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  The **[[de Rham differential]]** on [[smooth functions]] in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the [[function]]

$$
  \mathbf{d} \colon C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

which takes $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to

$$
  \mathbf{d}f \coloneqq \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \mathbf{d} x^i
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $x^i \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ one of the [[coordinate]] functions, the de Rham differential $\mathbf{d} x^i$ indeed coincides with the basis element of the same name according to def. \ref{Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}, using that 

$$
  \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{j}} = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      1 & | i = j
      \\
      0 & | otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The de Rham differentials $\mathbf{d} \colon C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are compatible with [[pullback of differential forms|pullback of differential 1-forms]], def. \ref{PullbackOfDifferential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}, in that for each coordinate transformation $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^{\tilde k} \to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) 
      &\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}& 
    \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k)
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi^\ast}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi^\ast}}
     \\
     C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{\tilde k}) 
       &\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}&   
     \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{\tilde k})    
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commutes]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is equivalently the statement of the _[[chain rule]]_ of [[differentiation]]: For any $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k)$ we have on the one hand, by def. \ref{PullbackOfDifferential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces} and def. \ref{DeRhamDifferentialOn1Forms}

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{d} \phi^\ast f
    & = 
    \mathbf{d} (f \circ \phi)
    \\
    & =
    \sum_{j = 1}^{\tilde k} \frac{\partial (f \circ \phi)}{\partial x^j}\mathbf{d} x^j
  \end{aligned}
$$

and on the other hand, applying the definition in the other order,

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi^* \mathbf{d}f
    & = 
    \phi^* \sum_{i = 1}^k \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \mathbf{d}x^i
    \\
    & = \sum_{i = 1}^k \sum_{j = 1}^{\tilde k} 
     \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\circ \phi \right)
    \cdot 
    \left(\frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial x^j}\right) \mathbf{d}x^j
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Both expressions agree precisely if for all $j$ we have

$$
  \frac{\partial (f \circ \phi)}{\partial x^j}
   =
  \sum_{i = 1}^k \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\circ \phi\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial x^j}\right)
  \;\;\;
  \in 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{\tilde k})
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the statement of the _[[chain rule]]_ for [[differentiation]].

Notice that as smooth spaces $\mathbb{R} = \Omega^0 = C^\infty(-)$, by prop.  \ref{SpaceOf0FormsIsRealLine}. Therefore the above says that

###### Proposition

The [[de Rham differential]], def. \ref{DeRhamDifferentialOn1Forms}, constitutes a homomorphism of smooth spaces, def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces}

from the [[real line]] to the universal smooth moduli space of differential 1-forms, def. \ref{SmoothModuliSpaceOfnForms}.

   \to

$$

###### Proposition

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the de Rham differential of def. \ref{DeRhamDifferentialInGeneralDegreeOverCartesianSpaces} constitutes a homomorphism of smooth spaces

##### Differentiation on smooth spaces
 {#DifferentiationOnSmoothSpaces}

We now extend the notion of [[derivatives]] and [[de Rham differentials]] from [[smooth functions]] on [[Cartesian spaces]] to smooth functions on general [[smooth spaces]].

Recall from def. \ref{DifferentialnFormOnSmoothSpace} that the set of differential $n$-forms on a [[smooth space]] $X$ is $\Omega^n(X) \coloneqq Hom(X, \Omega^n)$. 

+-- {: .num_defn #DeRhamDifferentialOverSmoothSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X \in Smooth0Type$ a smooth space and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[[de Rham differential]]** on $n$-forms over $X$ is the [[function]]

$$
  \mathbf{d} \colon \Omega^n(X) \to \Omega^{n+1}(X)
$$

which is the postcomposition with the homomorphism of smooth spaces of prop. \ref{DeRhamDifferentialAsMorphismOfSmoothSpacesInEachDegree}:
 
$$
  Hom(X,\mathbf{d}) \colon Hom(X,\Omega^n) \to Hom(X,\Omega^{n+1})
  \,.
$$

=--


In particular the [[derivative]] of a smooth function $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ is the [[composition|composite]]

$$
  \mathbf{d}f \colon X \stackrel{f}{\to} \mathbb{R} \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to} \Omega^1_{cl} \hookrightarrow \Omega^1
  \,.
$$

Below in _[Variation is differentiation on smooth spaces](#VariationIsDifferentiationOnSmoothSpaces)_ we find that this notion of differentiation of smooth functions on smooth spaces subsumes what traditionally is called _[[variational calculus]]_ of [[functionals]] on [[mapping spaces]].

##### Example: The electromagnetic field strength
 {#ElectromagneticFieldStrength}

for instance [[electromagnetic potential]]

$$
  A = \phi \mathbf{d}t + A_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 + A_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 + A_3 \mathbf{d}x^3
$$

then the [[electromagnetic field strength]] is

$$
  F 
    \coloneqq
  \mathbf{d}A 
    = 
   E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t 
    + 
   E_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}t 
    + 
   E_3 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
    + 
    B_1 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3 
    + 
    B_2 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1 
    + 
    B_3 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2 
$$

with 

$$
  E_i = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial t}
$$

and

$$
  B_1 = \frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x^3} - \frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x^2}
$$

etc


This are the first 2 of 4 [[Maxwell equations]]: $\mathbf{d} F = 0$

(the other 2 are discussed below in [Riemannian geometry](#RiemannianGeometry))

for

$$
  A,A' : X \to \Omega^1(-)
$$

a [[gauge transformation]] $A \to A'$
is $\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$
  A' = A + \mathbf{d} \lambda
$$



#### Variational calculus
 {#VariationalCalculus}

Traditionally a _[[functional]]_ is a [[function]] which is sufficiently like a [[smooth function]], but defined not on a [[manifold]], but on a [[mapping space]] between manifolds. Also traditionally, a _[[variational derivative]]_ of such a functional is something aking to a [[derivative]], generalized to this context, and subject to the condition that all variations _preserve some boundary conditions_. 

We formulate this classical theory in the context of [[smooth spaces]]. Here a [[nonlinear functional|functional]] is simply a homomorphism of smooth spaces out of a smooth [[mapping space]], as in def. \ref{SmoothFunctionSpace}. We may impose _respect for boundary conditions_ by forming the [[fiber product]] of this mapping space with a _discrete smooth space inclusion_, given in def. \ref{MapFromDiscretizationOfSmooth0Type} below. Then the _variational derivative_ is simply the ordinary derivative of def. \ref{DeRhamDifferentialOverSmoothSpaces}.

This sends a plot $U \to \flat X$, which by definition of $Disc(-)$ is a point in $\Gamma X$, hence a homomorphism $x \colon * \to X$, to the plot $U \to * \stackrel{x}{\to} X$ of $X$.

for the [[smooth space]] (a [[diffeological space]]) which is the [[mapping space]] from $\Sigma$ to $X$, hence such that for each $U \in $ [[CartSp]] we have

Let $\Sigma = [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the standard [[interval]]. Let

A **[[Artin ring|smooth Artin algebra]]** (also called a "Weil algebra" in the [[synthetic differential geometry]]-literature) is a [[smooth algebra]] $A$ whose underlying $\mathbb{R}$-[[vector space]] is a [[direct sum]] of the form

$$
  A = \mathbb{R} \oplus V
  \,,
$$

where $V$ is of finite [[dimension]] and such that every element $v \in V \subset A$ is nilpotent, in that there is $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the $n$-fold product of $v$ with itself in $A$ vanishes: $v^n = 0$.

All three functors in def. \ref{TheMorphismsOfSitesForCartSpInfinitesimalNeighbourhood} are [[morphisms of sites]]. The induced [[geometric morphism]] of [[sheaf toposes]] is of the form


$$
  Sh(CartSp)

###### Proposition

The sequence of [[geometric morphisms]]

$$
  Sh(CartSp) \stackrel{p^*}{\to} Sh(CartSp_{th}) \stackrel{\iota^*}{\to} Sh(InfPoint)
$$

exhibit a [[homotopy cofiber sequence]] in the [[(2,1)-category]] [[Topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion at _[(∞,1)Topos -- Existence of limits and colimits](%28infinity%2C1%29Topos#ExistenceOfLimitsAndColimits)_ the statement is equivalently that the [[inverse image]] functors

$$
  Sh(CartSp) 
    \stackrel{Lan_p}{\leftarrow}
  Sh(CartSp_{th})
    \stackrel{Lan_\iota}{\leftarrow}
  Sh(InfPoint)
$$

form a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] in [[(∞,1)Cat]]. Computing this in the [[model structure for quasi-categories]] after passing to [[nerves]], the morphism $N(Lan_p)$ is clearly an [[inner Kan fibration]] because of the [[subcategory]] inclusion $Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{th})$. So by the general discussion at [[homotopy pullback]] the homotopy fiber is given by the 1-categorical fiber of $N(Lan_p)$ in [[sSet]]. By the discussion at _[Left Kan extension - on representables](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kan+extension#LeftKanOnRepresentables)_ $Lan_p$ acts as $p$ on [[representable functor|representables]]. The 1-categorical fiber of $N(p) \colon N(CartSp_{th}) \to N(CartSp)$ is evidently $N(InfPoint)$. Since $Lan_\iota$ is a [[left adjoint]] it preserves colimits and since ever sheaf is a colimit of representables, this is sufficient to imply the claim.
