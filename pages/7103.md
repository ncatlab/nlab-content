## Definition

A **finite $(\infty,1)$-limit** is an [[(∞,1)-limit]] over a finitely presented [[(∞,1)-category]].

If we model our (∞,1)-categories by [[quasicategories]], then this can be made precise by saying it is a limit over some [[simplicial set]] with finitely many nondegenerate simplices.  Note that such a simplicial set is rarely itself a quasicategory; we regard it instead as a finite presentation of a quasicategory.

## Properties

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ out of an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ that has all finite $(\infty,1)$-limits preserves these finite $(\infty,1)$-limits as soon as it preserves [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] and the [[terminal object]].

(This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 4.4.2.5]].)

## Examples

* Binary products, pullbacks, and terminal objects are all finite $(\infty,1)$-limits.

* Unlike the case in [[1-category]] theory, the [[split idempotent|splitting of idempotents]] is *not* a finite $(\infty,1)$-limit.
