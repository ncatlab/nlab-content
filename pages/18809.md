## Idea

In [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] (or [[quantum chemistry]]) a _nucleus_ is a [[bound state]] of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]. If this in turn is surrounded by a shell of [[electrons]] the result is an [[atom (physics)|atom]], with the nucleus at its core.

The study of nuclei is the topic of [[nuclear physics]].
