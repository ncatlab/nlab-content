A subset $S$ of the set of [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ is _recursive_ if there is a total recursive or [[partial recursive function|computable function]] $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbf{2} = \{0, 1\}$ such that $S = f^{-1}(1)$. Recursive subsets are a proper subclass of the class of _recursively enumerable_ sets, which are domains of [[partial recursive functions]] $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. 

Recursive sets form a Boolean subalgebra of $P(\mathbb{N})$ (whereas recursively enumerable subsets do not form a Boolean subalgebra).
