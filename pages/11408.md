## Idea

The _Löwenheim-Skolem theorem_ is a basic result in the _[[model theory]]_ of [[first-order logic]] and is part of a family of closely related theorems that concern the relation between structures or [[models]] of [[first-order theories]] of different cardinality. 

Historically, the theorem was one of the first results in model theory with papers published by Löwenheim (1912) and Skolem (1920) which helped establishing first-order logic in the center of mathematical logic.

Although the theorem fails in second-order logic, variants hold in infinitary logic with countably infinite disjunctions and in categorical logic for [[sketches]]. The theorem plays an important role in [[abstract model theory]] e.g. in [[Lindström's theorems]] on the characterization of standard [[first-order logic]].
