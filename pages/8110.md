[arXiv:1206.6730](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1206.6730) A remark on a conjecture of Buzzard-Gee and the cohomology of Shimura varieties
from arXiv Front: math.NT by Christian Johansson
We compare the conjecture of Buzzard-Gee on the association of Galois
representations to C-algebraic automorphic representations with the conjectural
description of the cohomology of Shimura varieties due to Kottwitz, and the
reciprocity law at infinity due to Arthur. This is done by extending
Langlands's representation of the L-group associated with a Shimura datum to a
representation of the C-group of Buzzard-Gee. The approach offers an
explanation of the explicit Tate twist appearing in Kottwitz's description.
