## Idea

In [[physics]], a _semiclassical state_ is the approximation to a [[quantum state]] in [[semiclassical approximation]].

In the original sense of the [[WKB approximation]], in the [[Schrödinger picture]] a semiclassical state is a [[wave function]] which solves the [[Schrödinger equation]] to first order in [[Planck's constant]] $\hbar$.

In the broader formalization of quantum physics in [[symplectic geometry]]/[[geometric quantization]] one finds that such WKB semiclassical states are formalized as being [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] of the given [[phase space]] [[symplectic manifold]] equipped with with a [[half-density]].

## Definition

We first give the traditional definition of semiclassical states according to the [[WKB method]] for a non-relativistic [[particle]] propagating on the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard [[kinetic action]] and some arbitrary [[force]] potential
