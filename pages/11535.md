I am a $14$-year old student aspiring to be a mathematician. I work on algebraic geometry. I am interested in sheaf theory, specifically vector bundles on sites, as the below section titled "Ideas" shows. Feel free to email to me at devalapurkarsanath at gmail dot com (devalapurkarsanath@gmail.com).

###The Sheaf of Images of Sections of a Vector Bundle on a CW Complex###
Define a CW complex as a topological space for which there exists a choice of CW decomposition. Let $X$ be a CW complex. Denote the category of CW complexes as $\text{CW}$. Define also a category $\mathcal{C}(X)\to\text{Bund}$, i.e., a subcategory of $\text{Bund}$, with objects as vector bundles on the CW complex $X$, with morphisms as maps of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. Define the objects of a category $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{A})$. with $\mathcal{A}$ a category, as sequences of objects and morphisms in $\mathcal{A}$, with a morphism in $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{A})$, i.e., $f:(A_\bullet,\delta_\bullet)\to(B_\bullet,\Delta_\bullet)$, as $f:A_i\to B_i$.

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}(X)$, so that there exists a projection $p:\mathcal{B}\to X$. Let $X_0\subseteq X_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq X_n=X$ be the skeleton of a CW structure on $X$. There is the restricted bundle $p_i:p^{-1}(X_i)\to X_i$, where, by definition, $p_i(y):=p(y)$ for all $y\in X_i$. There is a section $s_0:X_0\to p^{-1}(X_0)$. Let $H^{i+1}(X_{i+1},X_i; \pi_i(F))$, where $F$ is a fiber $p^{-1}(x)$, vanish for all $i$. It is possible to extend $s_{n}$ to $s_{n+1}$, allowing us to inductively define an extended section, $s:X\to\mathcal{B}$. The images of the extended sections are CW complexes. The space of all images of the extended sections of $\mathcal{B}$ is denoted $\Pi_\mathcal{B}$.

The functor $F:\mathcal{C}(X)\to\mathcal{D}(\bigsqcup_{\mathcal{B}\in\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C}(X))}\Pi_\mathcal{B})$ assigns each vector bundle $\mathcal{B}$ a sequence of images of the extended sections of $\mathcal{B}$, where each image of the extended section appears at least once in the sequence.

We may take $\Pi_\mathcal{B}$ to be the sheaf of images of sections of $\mathcal B$, in which case $F$ defines the construction of the sheaf of images of sections given the vector bundle. It is easy to see that $F$ has a right adjoint functor: $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}(X)}(F\mathcal{B},\text{Seq}(\mathcal{B}))$ is in bijection with $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}(\bigsqcup_{\mathcal{B}\in\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C}(X))}\Pi_\mathcal{B})}(\mathcal{B},G\text{Seq}(\mathcal{B}))$, which defines the construction of the vector bundle given its sheaf of images of sections.

$\mathcal{C}(X)$ is the category of locally free sheaves on $X$, and hence is not Abelian. There is a geometric embedding $\mathcal{C}(X)\hookrightarrow\text{PSh}(X)$ induced by the inclusion functor $I:\mathcal{C}(X)\to\text{Sh}(X)$: $\mathcal{C}(X)\hookrightarrow\text{Sh}(X)\hookrightarrow \text{PSh}(X)$.

My research focuses on generalizing this to the sheaf of codomains of sections of a vector bundle on a site.
