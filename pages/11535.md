I am a $14$-year old student aspiring to be a mathematician. I love studying higher category theory. I've recently been studying the K-theory of $\infty$-operads, and seem to have answered a question posed by Gunnar Carlsson. For more information on this, read my notes available [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/54616b63a38cbf0748879f12/output/output.pdf?cache_bust=1418262375589).

More generally, though, what I'm interested in is studying the following interesting analogy:
><table><tr><th markdown="1">Spectra</th><th markdown="1">$\to$</th><th markdown="1">Stable $\infty$-categories</th></tr></table>

More precisely, I'm interested in studying stable $\infty$-categories like spectra.

My websites: [my blog](http://categorymath.wordpress.com), [my page at _Problems in Homotopy Theory_](http://topology-octopus.herokuapp.com/problemsinhomotopytheory/show/Sanath+Devalapurkar), and [nlab page](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sanath+Devalapurkar). I think I'll be updating the first more regularly than the others.

##Talk(s) and Notes##
 - I have given a talk at the AMS Fall Western Sectional Meeting on October 25th at San Francisco State University. Here are my [[AMS-Fall-Slides.pdf|AMS Fall Slides:file]].

 - Here are my notes on [[K-theory-and-Morita-Theory-revised.pdf|K-theory and Morita Theory:file]], which accompany the slides above.

 - Lastly, here are very very informal notes on [[Hopf-Galois-extensions.pdf|Hopf-Galois extensions:file]], that very likely contain crazy things that are most likely wrong (I'm aware of a few mistakes, but do inform me by email if you find anything!).
