I am a $14$-year old student aspiring to be a mathematician. I love studying higher category theory. I've recently been studying the K-theory of $\infty$-operads, and seem to have answered a question posed by Gunnar Carlsson. For more information on this, read my notes available [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/54616b63a38cbf0748879f12/output/output.pdf?cache_bust=1418262375589).

More generally, though, what I'm interested in is studying the following interesting analogy:
><table><tr><th markdown="1">Spectra</th><th markdown="1">$\to$</th><th markdown="1">Stable $\infty$-categories</th></tr></table>

More precisely, I'm interested in studying stable $\infty$-categories like spectra.

I am updating the first more regularly than the others.

##Talk(s) and Notes##
I will be giving a talk at the AMS Fall Western Sectional Meeting on October 25th at San Francisco State University. I have posted [my notes](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ams-fall-western-sectional-meeting-notes.pdf) and [my slides](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ams-fall-western-sectional-meeting.pdf) on my blog at the following links. Any comments would be welcome, either on my blog, through email, or on this nlab page itself.
