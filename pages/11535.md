I am a $14$-year old student aspiring to be a mathematician. I love studying higher category theory. Right now, I'm interested in a version of "$\mathit{K}$-theory" (it's a construction analagous to ordinary algebraic $\mathit{K}$-theory from Quillen's $Q$-construction) of $\mathrm{M}\mathrm{od}^\mathrm{O}_A(\mathrm{C}^\otimes)^\otimes$, where $\mathrm{C}^\otimes$ is a unital $\infty$-operad. [I have taken some notes on the same at my blog.](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/higher-algebra-k-theory2.pdf) See Lurie's [Higher Algebra](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/HigherAlgebra.pdf) for terminology.

I am updating the first more regularly than the others.

##Talk(s) and Notes##
I will be giving a talk at the AMS Fall Western Sectional Meeting on October 25th at San Francisco State University. I have posted [my notes](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ams-fall-western-sectional-meeting-notes.pdf) and [my slides](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ams-fall-western-sectional-meeting.pdf) on my blog at the following links. Any comments would be welcome, either on my blog, through email, or on this nlab page itself.

##Latest Blog Post##
Here I'll usually post my latest blog post.

###Equivariant $\mathit{K}$-theory of Higher Categories###
While I was working through my slides for my talk at the AMS Fall Western Sectional Meeting, I discovered some errors in my slides; some technical, some presentation-wise. I spent about two hours editing them, and the results are here:

 * [AMS Fall Western Sectional Meeting Slides](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ams-fall-western-sectional-meeting.pdf)

 * [AMS Fall Western Sectional Meeting Notes](https://categorymath.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ams-fall-western-sectional-meeting-notes.pdf)

The same errors that I've corrected in the slides and notes exist in my paper that I'd written earlier on the higher K-theory of $\infty$-categories, and I plan to edit that as well soon.
