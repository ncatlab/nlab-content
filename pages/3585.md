#Idea
The theory of hyperfunctions, created by the Japanese school of [[Mikio Sato]], [[Masaki Kashiwara]] et al. is one of the many variants of the theory of [[generalized functions]]. Unlike the earlier theory of distributions of Schwarz et alt. it is not based on duals of some spaces of smooth functions but rather on boundary values of holomorphic functions. This allows usage of sheaf theory and includes Schwartz distributions as a special case. For example in Schwarz's theory apart from measures one has functions with discrete support which are linear combinations of finite derivatives of delta functions. Here one can allow things like the exponential of a differential operator applied to a delta function. So in a sense one has distributions of infinite order. 

Hyperfunctions are a very useful tool in the study of [[D-modules]], holonomic systems of differential equations, and especially some aspects of [[symplectic geometry]] and [[harmonic analysis]] that are part of [[microlocal analysis]], especially [[algebraic microlocalization]]. 

#Definition

##hyperfunctions of one variable
Let $I = (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an open interval, a complex neighbourhood of $I$ is an open set $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that $U \bigcap \mathbb{R} = I$. For $V \subset \mathbb{C}$ open let $\mathcal{O}(V)$ be the [[sheaf]] of holomorphic functions on $V$.

The set of hyperfunctions on $I$ for a complex neighbourhood $U$ of $I$ is defined to be the quotient
$$
\mathcal{B}(I) := \frac{ \mathcal{O}(U/I) }{\mathcal{O}(U)}
$$

The set $\mathcal{B}(I)$ does not depend on the chosen complex neighbourhood $U$, which is a consequence of [[Mittag-Leffler's theorem]] in the one-dimensional case. The definition easily generalizes to open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

Let $U^+ := \{u \in U : \operatorname{Im}(u) \gt 0 \}$ and $U^- := \{u \in U : \operatorname{Im}(u) \lt 0 \}$, then a nontrivial hyperfunction can be described by two functions $F^+$ holomorphic on $U^+$ and $F^-$ holomorphic on $U^-$ such that there is no function $F$ holomorphic on $U$ that restricts to $F^+$ and $F^-$. In this sense hyperfunctions are "differences" of holomorphic functions on a "boundary" (we did not specify an algebraic object that contains both $F^+$ and $F^-$, so strictly speaking we cannot subtract them). 

In the following we will often write $F = (F^+, F^-)$ for a hyperfunction $F$, with $(F^+, F^-)$ being a representative of the equivalence class that is $F$ in $\mathcal{B}$ on some complex neighbourhood.

#basic properties and definitions

##hyperfunctions of one variable

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be open.

*  Let $\mathcal{A}(U)$ be the algebra space of real analytic functions on $U$, then $\mathcal{B}(U)$ is a module over $\mathcal{A}(U)$.

In fact every real analytic function $f$ is naturally an element of $\mathcal{B}(U)$ represented by (f, 0) or (0, -f) on a complex neighbourhood. Given any hyperfunction $F = (F^+, F^-)$ we can define the product by $f F := (f F^+, F^-) = (F^+, -f F^-)$ which can be shown to be independent of the various choices involved (representation of $F$, complex neighbourhood of $U$, domain of the extension of the domain of $f$).

* The sets of hyperfunctions of open subsets of $U$ form a [[flabby sheaf]] of [[vector spaces]] over $U$.

* There is a linear injection from the space of distributions $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ to the space of hyperfunctions $\mathcal{B}(U)$. The sheaf of germs of distributions is therefore a subsheaf of the sheaf of germs of hyperfunctions.

###support
In general we cannot speak of the value of a hyperfunction at a certain point, much like we cannot speak of the value of a distribution at a certain point. We say that a hyperfunction $F$ vanishes on an open subset $U'$ of $U$ if it coincides with the zero hyperfunction, which is of course equivalent to stating that there is a representation of $F = (F^+, F^-)$ such that the boundary values of $F^+$ and $F^-$ coincide on $U'$ and therefore define a real analytic function on $U'$. 

* definition: the **support** of a hyperfunction $F$ is the complement of the largest open subset of $U$ on which $F$ vanishes in the sense described above.
 
For any compact $K$ we will denote by $\mathcal{B}_K$ all hyperfunctions whose support is contained in $K$.

###integration for compactly supported hyperfunctions
Since we defined hyperfunctions for open subsets only, we do not yet know anything about hyperfunctions $\mathcal{B}_K$ with support in a compact subset $K$, but the following theorem tells us that there is no difference:

* theorem: Let $\mathcal{B}_K$ be all hyperfunctions with support contained in $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ compact and $V$ be any complex neighbourhood of $K$. Then we have the following isomorphism:
$$
\mathcal{B}_K \cong \frac{ \mathcal{O}(V/K) }{\mathcal{O}(V)}
$$

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a \leq b$ and suppose that $F$ is a hyperfunction that is analytical in $a$ and $b$. Then we can choose a complex neighbourhood $V$ of $[a, b]$, paths $\tau^+$ in $V^+$  and $\tau^-$ in $V^-$ from a to b and a representation of $F = (F^+, F^-)$ such that we can define the integral

$$
\int_a^b F(x) dx := \int_{\tau^+} F^+ (z) dz - \int_{\tau^-} F^- (z) dz
$$

independently of all the arbitrary choices we made, thanks to the holomorphy of the functions on the right side (and Cauchy's integral formula for holomorphic functions, of course).
