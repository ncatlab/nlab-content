The abelian [[cohomology]] of a $k$-[[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ with coefficients in the left $\mathfrak{g}$-module $M$ is defined as $H_*^{Lie}(\mathfrak{g},M) = Tor^{U\mathfrak{g}}_*(k,M)$ where $k$ is the ground field understood as a trivial module over the universal enveloping algebra $U\mathfrak{g}$. In particular it is a derived functor. It can be computed using [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] as the homology of the chain complex

$$ M \otimes_{U\mathfrak{g}} CE(\mathfrak{g}) = M\otimes_{U\mathfrak{g}} U\mathfrak{g}\otimes_k \Lambda^* \mathfrak{g} = M\otimes_k \Lambda^* \mathfrak{g}. $$
