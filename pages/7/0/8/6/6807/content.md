## Idea

The _BFSS matrix model_ ([Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind 96](#BanksFischlerShenkerSusskind96), [Seiberg 97](#Seiberg97)) is the description of the [[worldline]] dynamics of interacting  [[D0-branes]]. In the [[large N limit]] of a large number of [[D0-branes]] this is  supposed to encode the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strong coupling limit]] of [[type IIA string theory]] known as _[[M-theory]]_  at least in certain corners of its [[moduli space]].

The BFSS model is a limiting case of the _[[BMN matrix model]]_, which improves on some of its shortcomings (see the [Open problems](#OpenProblems) below).

The BFSS matrix model was argued to arise in several seemingly rather different (but apparently secretly equivalent) ways: 

1. as the [[worldline]] theory of a large number of [[D0-branes]] in [[type IIA string theory]], 

1. as the [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of [[10d super Yang-Mills theory]] to 1+0 space dimensions, 

1. {#AsM2Regularization} as a certain non-commutative regularization  of the [[light-cone gauge quantization]] of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] for the [[M2-brane]] ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98), [Dasgupta-Nicolai-Plefka 02](#DasguptaNicolaiPlefka02)). 

   In this picture matrix blocks around the diagonal correspond to blobs of [[membrane]], while off-diagonal matrix elements correspond to thin tubes of membrane connecting these blobs.

In any case, the BFSS matrix model ends up being a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system whose bosonic degrees of freedom are a set of 9+1 large [[matrices]]. These play the role of would-be [[coordinate functions]] and their [[eigenvalues]] may be interpreted as points in a [[non-commutative geometry|non-commutative]] [[spacetime]] thus defined.

There is also the [[IKKT matrix model]], which takes this one step further by reducing one dimension further down to [[D(-1)-branes]] in [[type IIB string theory]]. 

See also at _[[membrane matrix model]]_.

## Open problems
 {#OpenProblems}

### General
 {#OpenProblemsGeneral}

In the 1990s there was much excitement about the BFSS model (and then its cousin, the [[IKKT matrix model]]), as people hoped it might provide a definition of [[M-theory]], whose formulation remains [elusive](M-theory#TheOpenProblem). It is from these times that [[Edward Witten]] changed the original suggestion that "M" is for "magic, mystery and membrane" to the suggestion that it is for "magic, mystery and matrix". (See [Witten's 2014 Kyoto prize speech](M-theory#Witten14), last paragraph.) 

However, while the BFSS matrix model clearly sees something M-theoretic, just as clearly it is not the full answer. Notably it needs for its definition an ambient [[asymptotic boundary|asymptotic]] [[Minkowski spacetime]] [[background field|background]], a light cone limit and a peculiar scaling of [[string coupling]] over [[string length]], all of which means that it pertains to a particular corner of a full theory. 

From [Nicolai-Helling 1998, p. 2](#NicolaiHelling98):

> Despite the recent excitement, however, we do not think that M(atrix) theory and the $d= 11$ supermembrane in their present incarnation are already the final answer in the search for M-Theory, even though they probably are important pieces of the puzzle. There are still too many ingredients missing that we would expect the final theory to possess. For one thing, we would expect a true theory of quantum gravity to exhibit certain pregeometrical features corresponding to a “dissolution” of space-time and the emergence of some kind of non-commutative geometry at short distances; although the matrix model does achieve that to some extent by replacing commuting coordinates by non-commuting matrices, it seems to us that a still more radical departure from conventional ideas about space and time may be required in order to arrive at a truly background independent formulation (the matrix model “lives” in nine _flat_ transverse dimensions only). Furthermore, there should exist some huge and so far completely hidden symmetries generalizing not only the duality symmetries of extended supergravity and string theory, but also the principles underlying general relativity.

From [Mohammed-Murugan-Nastase 2010, p. 6](#MohammedMuruganNastase10):

>  If Matrix theory is to correctly describe M-theory (and its dimensional reduction to type IIA string theory) then it should be able to describe all D−branes in the theory and not just D2−branes. For example, a D4−brane wrapping an $S^4$ was found in [9], following the earlier works of [10, 11], but the solution is not without several unresolved subtleties. In general, finding the complete spectrum of D−branes from Matrix
theory remains a very difficult problem. The D2− and D4−branes already found are reductions to
ten dimensions of M2− and M5−branes, and while they are a minimum necessary for the spectrum of M-theory, they are by no means sufficient. Indeed, we would also need to find a D6−brane, coming from an eleven dimensional KK monopole, and a D8−brane.

Then, even assuming that all the crucial [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|cohomological]] aspects of [[D-brane]] and [[M-brane]] charges (in [[twisted differential K-theory]], [[twisted cohomotopy]] etc.) are secretly encoded in the matrix model, somehow, none of this is manifest, making the matrix model spit out numbers about a conceptually elusive theory in close analogy to how [[lattice QCD]] produces numbers without informing us about the actual conceptual nature of [[confinement|confined]] [[hadron]] physics.


A similar assessment has been given by [[Greg Moore]], from pages 43-44 of his _[[Physical Mathematics and the Future]]_ (2014, [here](Physical+Mathematics+and+the+Future#AGoodStartWasGivenByTheMatrixTheory)):

> A good start $[$with defining M-theory$]$ was given by the Matrix theory approach of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind. We have every reason to expect that this theory produces the correct scattering amplitudes of modes in the 11-dimensional supergravity multiplet in 11-dimensional Minkowski space - even at energies sufficiently large that black holes should be created. (This latter phenomenon has never been explicitly demonstrated). But Matrix theory is only a beginning and does not give us the whole picture of M-theory. The program ran into increasing technical difficulties when more complicated compactifications were investigated. (For example, compactification on a six-dimensional torus is not very well understood at all. $[$...$]$). Moreover, to my mind, as it has thus far been practiced it has an important flaw: It has not led to much significant new mathematics.

> If history is a good guide, then we should expect that anything as profound and far-reaching as a fully satisfactory formulation of M-theory is surely going to lead to new and novel mathematics. Regrettably, it is a problem the community seems to have put aside - temporarily. But, ultimately, Physical Mathematics must return to this grand issue.

### Ground state
 {#ProblemsGroundState}

There are furcher technical open issues, such as the open question whether the theory has a decent ground state the way it needs to have to make sense (see the references [below](#ReferencesGroundStateProblem)).
