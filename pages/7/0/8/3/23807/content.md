## Idea ##

In the same vein that [[commutative rings]] are to [[integral domains]] and [[GCD rings]] are to [[GCD domains]], [[prefield of fractions]] are to [[field of fractions]]. 

## Definition ##

For a [[commutative ring]] $R$, where $\mathrm{Can}(D)$ is the [[multiplicative submonoid of cancellative elements]], the corresponding [[commutative localization]] $D\to (\mathrm{Can}(D))^{-1} D$ is an injective homomorphism of rings and $Q(D) = (\mathrm{Can}(D))^{-1} D$ is a prefield, called the **prefield of fractions** or the quotient prefield of $D$. 

Its elements are fractions $a/b$ where $a\in D$ and $b\in \mathrm{Can}(D)$ which are by the definition the equivalence classes of pairs $(a,b) \in D\times \mathrm{Can}(D)$ and $(a,b)\sim (c,d)$ iff $a d = b c$. The addition is given by the formula
$$
\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}
$$
and multiplication by $(a/b)(c/d) = (ac)/(bd)$.
