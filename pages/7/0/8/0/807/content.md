The **Euler characteristic** can refer to a number of different numerical invariants of different sorts of objects.  But all of them bear a family resemblance and in some cases they can be shown to agree.

* The Euler characteristic of a [[topological space]] can be defined as the alternating sum of the ranks of its [[homology]] groups (when this is finite).

* The Euler characteristic of a [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal category]] is the [[trace]] of its identity morphism.  Applied to suspension [[spectrum|spectra]] in the [[stable homotopy category]], this recovers the usual Euler characteristic of a [[manifold]].

* There is a definition, due to Tom Leinster, of the Euler characteristic of a (suitably finite) [[category]], which generalizes the notion of [[groupoid cardinality]].
