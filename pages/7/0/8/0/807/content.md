The **Euler characteristic** can refer to a number of different numerical invariants of different sorts of objects.  But all of them bear a family resemblance and in some cases they can be shown to agree.

* The Euler characteristic of a [[topological space]] can be defined as the alternating sum of the ranks of its [[homology]] groups (when this is finite).

* The Euler characteristic of a [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal category]] is the [[trace]] of its identity morphism.  Applied to suspension [[spectrum|spectra]] in the [[stable homotopy category]], this recovers the usual Euler characteristic of a manifold.

* There is a definition, due to Tom Leinster, of the Euler characteristic of a (suitably finite) [[category]], which generalizes the notion of [[groupoid cardinality]].

from arXiv Front: math.CT by Thomas M. Fiore, Wolfgang L&#252;ck, Roman Sauer
In a previous article, we introduced notions of finiteness obstruction, Euler
characteristic, and L^2-Euler characteristic for wide classes of categories. In
this sequel, we prove the compatibility of those notions with homotopy colimits
of I-indexed categories where I is any small category admitting a finite
I-CW-model for its I-classifying space. Special cases of our Homotopy Colimit
Formula include formulas for products, homotopy pushouts, homotopy orbits, and
transport groupoids. We also apply our formulas to Haefliger complexes of
groups, which extend Bass--Serre graphs of groups to higher dimensions. In
particular, we obtain necessary conditions for developability of a finite
complex of groups from an action of a finite group on a finite category without
loops.
