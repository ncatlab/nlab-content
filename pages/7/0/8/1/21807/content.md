\section{Idea}

In [[signal processing]], _modulation_ refers to modification of a standard [[waveform]] (for example a [[sine wave]]) according to a fixed algorithm in order to create a [[signal]] conveying the input to that algorithm. To create a [[digital signal]], for example, the input to such an algorithm would typically be a sequence $S$ of [[bit|bits]], and the output of the algorithm would be a [[waveform]] from whose properties $S$ can be recovered.

\section{Digital modulation}

The following are forms of digital modulation.
