A terminal object in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[object]] $1$ of $C$ satisfying the following universal property: for every object $x$ of $C$, there exists a unique [[morphism]] $!:x\to 1$.  The terminal object of any category, if it exists, is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]].  If the terminal object is also [[initial object|initial]], it is called a [[zero object]]

A terminal object may also be viewed as a [[limit]] over the empty diagram.  Conversely, a limit over a diagram is a terminal cone over that diagram.

For any object $x$ in a category with terminal object $1$, the categorical [[product]] $x\times 1$ and the [[exponential object]] $x^1$ both exist and are canonically isomorphic to $x$.

Some examples of terminal objects in notable categories follow:
* The terminal object of a [[poset]] is its greatest element, if it exists.
* Any one-element set is a terminal object in the category [[Set]].
* The trivial [[group]] is the terminal object of [[Grp]] and, as an [[abelian group]], of [[Ab]].
* The terminal object of [[Ring]] is the zero ring.  (Note however that if [[rings]] have unities and [[ring homomorphisms]] must preserve them, then the zero ring is not a [[zero object]] of [[Ring]].)
* The terminal object of [[Cat]] is the category with just one object and its [[identity morphism|identity]].
