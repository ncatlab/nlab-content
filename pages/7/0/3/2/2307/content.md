## Idea

In the context of [[cobordism theory]], a [[generalized cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by a [[Thom spectrum]] is called a _cobordism cohomology theory_. (Dually, the corresponding [[generalized homology theory]] is called _[[bordism homology theory]]_.)

By default "cobordism cohomology" usually refers to what is represented by [[MO]].  The cohomology represented by [[MU]] is _[[complex cobordism cohomology]]_. Both are unified by the [[equivariant cohomology theory]] called [[MR-theory]]. The [[periodic cohomology theory]] version is denoted [[MP]].

On the other hand, [[framed manifold|framed]] cobordism cohomology theory ($M G$ for $G$ the [[trivial group]]) is _[[stable cohomotopy]]_ (by the [[Pontryagin-Thom theorem]]).
