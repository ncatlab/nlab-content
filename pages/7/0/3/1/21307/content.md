## Idea

In [[physics]], specifically in [[quantum hadrodynamics]] and in [[string theory]], a _Regge trajectory_ is, for any given type of [[physical system]] but specifically for [[hadrons]] and for [[strings]], the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the [[mass]]-squared as a [[function]] of total [[angular momentum]] (with all other properties held fixed).

## Properties

### Hadron supersymmetry

The Regge trajectories of [[mesons]] and of [[hadrons]] are observed to have essentially the same slope.

This phenomenon is explained by [[hadron supersymmetry]].
