A [[category]] $C$ is **connected** if any two [[objects]] can be connected by a [[zigzag]] of [[morphisms]].

In other words, if the groupoidification of the category (the [[Kan fibrant replacement]] of its [[nerve]]) is a [[connected]] [[âˆž-groupoid]]. Equivalently, if the [[localization]] $C[C_1^{-1}]$ is a connected groupoid.

A **connected limit** is a [[limit]] whose domain category is connected.
