## Idea

A [[groupoid]] is [[connected]] if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] and every object is connected by a morphism to every other object.

Every [[category]] $C$ induces a groupoid $G(C)$ by freely inverting all its [[morphism]]s. A category is connected if the groupoid $G(C)$ is.


## Definition

A [[category]] $C$ is **connected** if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]] and the following equivalent conditions hold

* any two [[objects]] can be connected by a [[zigzag]] of [[morphisms]].

* the $\infty$-groupoidification of the category (the [[Kan fibrant replacement]] of its [[nerve]]) is a [[connected]] [[âˆž-groupoid]]

* the [[localization]] $C[C_1^{-1}]$ of $C$ at all its morphisms is a connected groupoid.
