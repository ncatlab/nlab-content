A [[category]] is **connected** if any two [[objects]] can be connected by a [[zigzag]] of [[morphisms]].

In other words, if the groupoidification of the category (the [[Kan fibrant replacement]] of its [[nerve]]) is a [[connected]] [[∞-groupoid]].

A **connected limit** is a [[limit]] whose domain category is connected.
