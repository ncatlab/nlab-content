Drinefel'd looked at quantum groups as objects of the category dual to the category of associative coassociative unital counital [[Hopf algebras]]. In (PW) a __short exact sequence of quantum groups__ is defined, as sequences whose dual sequences of Hopf algebras are of the form

$$ B \stackrel{i}\hookrightarrow A\stackrel{p}\to A/I $$

where $B\hookrightarrow A$ is an inclusion of Hopf algebras, $I$ is a Hopf ideal in $A$ such that the quotient map $p$ is the cokernel of $i$ in the category of Hopf algebras. This corresponds to the exact sequence of affine group schemes when the Hopf algebras involved are commutative. 

On the other hand, this definition does not work already for formal group schemes which correspond to cocommutative Hopf algebras. Additional problem is that according to a counterexample of (SchneiderESQGr) $B$ is not necessarily a normal Hopf algebra, nor $I$ a normal Hopf ideal (contrary to blank assertion in (PW)). For these reasons, Schneider introduces a notion of __short strictly exact sequence of Hopf algebras__, as a sequence as above which satisfies the following 3 conditions  

* (a) $B$ is a normal Hopf subalgebra of $A$

* (b) $A$ is right faithfully coflat over $A/I$

* (c) $p = coker(i)$ in the category of Hopf algebras.

There is a dual and equivalent by (SchneiderESQGr) set of conditions:

* (a') $I$ is a normal Hopf ideal in $A$

* (b') $A$ is right faithfully coflat over $A/I$

* (c') $i=ker(p)$ in the category of Hopf algebras.
