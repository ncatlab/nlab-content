## Idea

A notion of [[ordered ring]] for [[strict weak orders]]. 

## Definition

A strictly weakly ordered ring is an [[ring]] $R$ with a [[strict weak order]] $\lt$ such that 

* $0 \lt 1$

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then $0 \lt a + b$

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then $0 \lt a \cdot b$

## Properties

Every strictly weakly ordered ring is a [[preordered ring]] given by the [[negation]] of the strict weak order. In the presence of [[excluded middle]], every strictly weakly ordered ring is a [[total order|totally preordered]] ring. 

## Examples

* Every [[pseudo-ordered ring]] is a strictly weakly ordered ring. 

* Every [[ordered local ring]] is a strictly weakly ordered ring where every element greater than zero or less than zero is invertible.

* Every [[ordered Kock field]] is a example of a strictly weakly ordered ring which in the presence of [[excluded middle]] is a [[linearly ordered ring]].
