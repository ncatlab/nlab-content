## Idea

In ([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]] a _hidden sector_ is a subspace of the space of [[field (physics)|fields]] whose only [[interaction]] with the remaining fields is via [[gravity]].

If one interprets the remaining fields as constituting a [[model (physics)|model]] for [[phenomenology]], then in the world this describes the fields in the subspace are literally hidden, they can only bee "seen" via their gravitational pull (or via [[gravitational waves]]).

Hidden sectors as a model for the real world remain hypothetical. They have been postulated notably as a means to explain [[supersymmetry breaking]] (see [below](#SupersymmetryBreaking)). They appear generically in [[perturbative string theory vacua]] (further [below](#InStringTheory)) after [[KK-compactification]].

## Definition

Specifically in [[Lagrangian field theory]] this means that the [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ over [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ is a [[fiber product]]

$$
  E \underoverset{\simeq}{(p_1,P_2)}{\longrightarrow} E_{1} \times_\Sigma E_2
$$

such that the [[interaction]] [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}_{int}$ is of the form

$$
  \mathbf{L}_{int}
  =
  p_1^\ast \mathbf{L}_{int,1}
  +
  p_2^\ast \mathbf{L}_{int,2}
  + 
  \mathbf{L}_{grav}
$$

where the first two summands are [[pullback of differential forms|pullbacks]] of interactions of the fields in $E_1$ and $E_2$ separately, while the last summand is the interaction term of [[gravity]] coupled to the respective fields jointly.

In this case $E_2$ is a _sector hidden from_ $E_1$, and conversely.

## Examples

### In supersymmetry breaking
 {#SupersymmetryBreaking}

The concept of [[gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking]] resulted from study of [[gaugino condensation]] in a hidden sector. ([Nilles 01](#Nilles01))


### In string theory
  {#InStringTheory}

In [[string theory]] hidden sectors appear naturally in various ways.

[[Hořava-Witten theory]] at finite interval length gives rise to a copy of [[heterotic supergravity]] at each of the "endpoints", which, as [[gauge theories]], interact with each others only via [[bulk]] gravity. 


In [[model (physics)|models]] of [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] such as the [[G2-MSSM]], the 4d gauge-field content arises under [[KK-compactification]] from 3-cycles in the [[G2-manifold]] [[fiber bundle|fiber]], and if two such do not intersect, they give rise to hidden sectors in the 4d physics. (e.g. [Kane 17, section 4.4](#Kane17))
