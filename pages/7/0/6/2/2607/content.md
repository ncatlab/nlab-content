Classical, quantum and statistical mechanics may all be seen as varieties of matrix mechanics for different [[rig|rigs]].  In quantum mechanics we use linear algebra over the ring $\mathbb{C}$; in classical mechanics everything is formally the same, but we instead use the rig $\mathbb{R}_{min} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}$, where the addition is $min$ and the multiplication is $+$.  

Statistical mechanics (or better, 'thermal statics') is matrix mechanics over a rig $\mathbb{R}^T$ that depends on 
the temperature $T$. As $T \to 0$, the rig $\mathbb{R}^T$ reduces to $\mathbb{R}_{min}$ and thermal statics reduces to classical statics, just as quantum dynamics reduces to classical dynamics as Planck's constant approaches zero.

The dynamics of particles becomes the statics of strings after Wick rotation.
