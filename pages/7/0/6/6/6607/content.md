In [[physics]], __contraction__ is a dilation with coefficient $\lambda\lt 1$. This notion is used in fixed point theory, theory of topological vector spaces etc. There is also a notion of contraction from [[metric space]] theory; see [[short map]]. There is also a notion of [[tensor contraction]]. There is also a notion of contraction in [[dependent type theory]]; see [[center of contraction]]. Finally, the [[contraction rule]] is a structural rule in [[logic]] and [[type theory]].
