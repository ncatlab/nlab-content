A series of articles by [[Marco Grandis]] on describing [[extended cobordism]]s in terms of [[multi-cospan]]s in [[Top]]

* I, Higher cospans and weak cubical categories ([pdf](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/18/12/18-12.pdf))

* II, Collared cospans, cohomotopy and TQFT ([pdf](http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/wCub2.pdf))

* III: Cubical cospans and higher cobordisms ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2359))

Some of the crucial ideas appearing here are

* a notion of cubical [[multispan|multi-cospans]] in ssome category;

* the observation that [[extended cobordism]]s should be modeled by such multi-cospans (in particular in [[Top]]);

* the observation that such cospans naturally map into [[span]]s by homming them into target objects, and that such spans can be linearized such as to yield [[FQFT]]s.

  * (Grandis seems not to mention (?) the fact that [[groupoidification]] makes this interpretation of spans as linear maps very natural)

* the relevance of evaluating functors which preserve (homotopy) [[pushout]]s on (mult)-cospan.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I am thinking that with just a bit more, this yields the right general nonsense version of what abstractly a $\sigma$-model QFT should be. Remarks to that extent currently in the file linked to at [[multispan]].
