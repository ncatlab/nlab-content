## Idea

An _equivariant Pontrjagin theorem_ should generalize the [[Pontrjagin theorem]] from plain [[homotopy theory]]/[[cobordism theory]] to [[equivariant homotopy theory]]/[[equivariant cobordism theory]]:

Where the plain [[Pontrjagin theorem]] identifies the [[Cohomotopy]] of a [[differentiable manifold]] with its [[cobordism classes]] of [[normally framed submanifolds]], an equivariant Pontrjagin theorem should identify [[equivariant Cohomotopy]] with [[fixed locus|fixed]] [[submanifolds]] whose [[normally framed submanifold|normal framing]] inherits the [[linear representation]] of the given [[RO(G)-degree]].

### General

A fully general version of an equivariant Pontrjagin theorem is not known (?) and not expected to exist (?) because [[Thom's transversality theorem]] (which, in one formulation or another, underlies the proof of the ordinary [[Pontrjagin theorem]]) is known to fail equivariantly: Since [[equivariant functions]] need to send [[fixed points]] to [[fixed points]], an equivariant map from an [[open neighbourhood]] of fixed points to an isolated fixed point has no equivariant deformation whatsoever, let along a [[regular point|regular]] one.

### For free $G$-manifolds

This problem with transversaliuty goes away when the [[action]] on the [[domain]] [[G-manifold]] is [[free action]]. In this case the equivariant Pontrjagin theorem in [Cruickshank 99, Thm. 5.06](#Cruickshank99).

Of course, this case is only "mildly equivariant": When the $G$-action on the domain [[G-manifold]] is [[free action|free]] then its [[equivariant homotopy theory]] should essentially reduce to plain [[homotopy theory]] of the [[quotient space]]. Indeed, [Cruickshank 99, Cor. 6.0.13](#Cruickshank99) identifies, in this case, [[equivariant Cohomotopy]] with [[cobordism classes]] of [[normally twisted-framed submanifolds]], i.e. identifies it with the [[twisted Pontrjagin theorem]] ([Cruickshank 03, Lemma 5.2](#Cruickshank03)) on the quotient.
