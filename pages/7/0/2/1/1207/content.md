In a strict symmetric monoidal category $D$ with symmetry $\tau$, a map $\triangleright : C\otimes A\to A$ of a comonoid $(C,\Delta_C)$ on a monoid $(A,\mu_A)$ is a __measuring__, or we say that $C$ *measures* $A$ if 
$$
C\triangleright \mu_A = \mu_A\circ(\triangleright \otimes \triangleright)\circ (C\otimes \tau\otimes A)\circ (\Delta_C\otimes A\otimes A) : C\otimes A\otimes A\to A.
$$
In Sweedler notation, we also write $c\triangleright (ab) = 
\sum (c_{(1)}\triangleright a)(c_{(2)}\triangleright b)$.
A [[Hopf action]] is a special case of measuring which is also an action of a <em> bimonoid </em> where $B=(C,\mu_C)$. Measurings are used e.g. do define the (cocycled) [[crossed product algebra]]s, see also [[cleft extension]]. For measurings and module algebras see

There are also more elaborate versions of measurings, which play role in a Galois theory, see
