## Disambiguation

in [[logic]], [[higher category theory]], and the [[foundations]] of mathematics, _equality_ is a notion of when two objects of a collection are considered to be the same objects. 

Here is a list of distinctions between different notions of _equality_, in different contexts, where possibly all the following pairs of notions are, in turn, "the same", just expressed in terms of different terminologies:

* the difference between [[axiom|axiomatic]] and [[definition|defined]] equality;
* the difference between [[equality]] and [[identity]],
* the difference between intensional and extensional equality,
* the difference between [[propositional equality]], [[judgmental equality]], and [[typal equality]], see also [[equality in type theory]]
* the difference between equality and [[isomorphism]],
* the difference between equality and [[equivalence]],
* the possibility of operations that might not preserve equality.
