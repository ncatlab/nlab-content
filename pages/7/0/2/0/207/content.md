## Idea

There is a lot of interesting stuff to be said about _equality_ in [[logic]], [[higher category theory]], and the [[foundations]] of mathematics, but it hasn\'t all been said here yet.

## Different kinds of equality
   {#DifferentKinds}

Here is a list of distinctions between different notions of _equality_, in different contexts, where possibly all the following pairs of notions are, in turn, "the same", just expressed in terms of different terminologies:

*  the difference between axiomatic and defined equality;
*  the difference between identity and equality,
*  the difference between intensional and extensional equality,
*  the difference between equality and [[isomorphism]],
*  the difference between equality and [[equivalence]],
*  the possibility of operations that might not preserve equality.


### In type theory

In a formal language such as [[type theory]], one distinguishes various different notions of _equality_ or _equivalence_ of the terms of the language. The most basic one is _definitional equality_ or _intensional equality_.

According to [PML (1980), p. 31](#PML):

> Definitional equality is intensional equality, or equality of meaning (synonymy). [...] It is a relation between linguistic expressions [...] Definitional equality is the equivalence relation generated by abbreviatory definitions, changes of [[bound variables]] and the [[principle of substituting equals for equals]]. [...] Definitional equality can be used to rewrite expressions [...].

on p. 60:

> ... intensional (sameness of meaning) ...

For instance the symbols "$2$" and "$s(s(0))$" (meaning the successor of the successor of $0$) are definitionally/extensionally equal terms (of type the [[natural numbers]]): the first is an abbreviation for the second.

Even the symbols "$2 + 2$" and "$4$" are not definitionally/intensionally equal, by some definitions.  In particular, if addition is defined by [[recursion]] and we evaluate definitions by $beta$-[[beta-reduction|reduction]] (in the generalised sense), then both of these symbols are defined to be abbreviations for "$s(s(s(s(0))))$".

On the other hand, it is pretty much impossible to write down a general definition of equality such that the symbols "$a + b$" and "$b + a$" (in a [[context]] with free variables $a$ and $b$ for, say, [[natural numbers]]) are equal _by definition_. They are (only) _extensionally_ equal. An actual proof is necessary to demonstrate their equality: it is not a definition but a theorem that $a + b = b + a$ for all natural numbers $a, b$.

In type theory, this extensional equality is a [[judgement]] (an assertion of truth in the meta-language), not itself yet a [[proposition]] (an item in the formal system itself). One says that _propositional equality_ of two terms is what is exhibited by their [[identity type]]/[[proposition]]. For instance $Id_{\mathbb{N}}(2+2,4)$ is the [[propositions as types|type/proposition]] that $2+2$ is propositionally equal to $4$. Exhibiting a term of this type is exhibiting a propositonal identity between the two.


## In sets

Here is an important practical fact: every [[set]] $S$ has an __equality relation__, a binary [[relation]] according to which two elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$ are related if and only if they are equal; in this case we write $x = y$.  This is the smallest [[reflexive relation]] on $S$, and it is in fact an [[equivalence relation]]; it is the only equivalence relation on $S$ that is also a [[partial order]] (although that fact is somewhat circular).  This relation is often called the __identity relation__ on $S$, either because 'identity' can mean 'equality' or because it is the [[identity]] for [[composition]] of relations.

As a [[subset]] of $S \times S$, the equality relation is often called the __[[diagonal]]__ and written $\Delta_S$ or similarly.  As an abstract set, this subset is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $S$ itself, so one also sees the diagonal as a map, the [[diagonal function]] $S \overset{\Delta_S}\to S \times S$, which maps $x$ to $(x,x)$; note that $x = x$.  This is in [[Set]]; analogous [[diagonal morphisms]] exist in any [[cartesian monoidal category]].
