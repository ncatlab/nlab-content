## Idea

There is a lot of interesting stuff to be said about _equality_ in [[logic]], [[higher category theory]], and the [[foundations]] of mathematics, but it hasn\'t all been said here yet.

## Different kinds of equality
   {#DifferentKinds}

Here is a list of distinctions between different notions of _equality_, in different contexts, where possibly all the following pairs of notions are, in turn, "the same", just expressed in terms of different terminologies:

*  the difference between [[axiom|axiomatic]] and [[definition|defined]] equality;
*  the difference between identity and equality,
*  the difference between intensional and extensional equality,
*  the difference between equality [[judgements]], equality [[propositions]], and equality [[types]]
*  the difference between equality and [[isomorphism]],
*  the difference between equality and [[equivalence]],
*  the possibility of operations that might not preserve equality.


## Notions of equality in type theory

In a formal language such as [[type theory]], one distinguishes various different notions of _equality_ or _equivalence_ of the terms of the language.

In [[type theory]], there are broadly three different notions of equality which could be distinguished: **judgmental equality**, **propositional equality**, and **typal equality**. Judgmental equality is defined as a basic judgment in type theory. Propositional equality is defined as a proposition in any two-layered type theory with a layer of types and a layer of propositions. Typal equality defined as a type in type theory. 

### Judgmental equality

The first notion of equality is **[[judgmental equality]]**, where we simply judge two elements to be equal to each other. Judgmental equality is expressed in type theory by a separate [[judgment]]: in addition to typing judgments $\Gamma \vdash (t:A)$, we have equality judgments $\Gamma \vdash (t = t'): A$. The rules for manipulating such judgments then include reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, making judgmental equality into a judgmental [[equivalence relation]]. 

However, not all type theories have judgmental equality; most [[first-order theories]] use propositional equality in place of judgmental equality, and [[objective type theories]] use typal equality in place of judgmental equality.

### Propositional equality

In any two-layer type theory with a layer of [[types]] and a layer of [[propositions]], or equivalently a [[first order logic]] over [[type theory]] or a [[first-order theory]], every type $A$ has a binary [[relation]] according to which two elements $x$ and $y$ of $A$ are related if and only if they are equal; in this case we write $x =_A y$. Since relations are propositions in the context of a term variable judgment in the type layer, this is called **[[propositional equality]]**. The formation and introduction rules for propositional equality is as follows

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, x:A, y:A \vdash x =_A y \; \mathrm{prop}} \quad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash x:A \quad \Gamma \vdash y:A}{\Gamma \vdash x =_A y \; \mathrm{true}}$$

In addition, one could have propositional equality between the types themselves, with formation and introduction rules

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{prop}} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{true}}$$

Notable examples of propositional equality include the equality in all flavors of [[set theory]], such as [[ZFC]] or [[ETCS]].  

The presence of propositional equality is part of the axiomatization of first-order theories, although this is usually swept under the rug by including propositional equality by default in all first-order theories.  (It has to be made more explicit in a structural set theory such as [[SEAR]], where there is no propositional equality on sets themselves, only on elements of a particular set.) By contrast, in a first order theory without propositional equality, propositional equality is an [[equivalence relation]] which has to be put onto a [[type]] or [[preset]].

### Typal equality

However, not all type theories are [[first order logic]] over [[type theory]], nor are they even two-layered type theories. In type theories with only one layer for types, equality is not a relation. Instead, we have what are called **[[typal equality]]**, as equality of both terms and types are represented by types.  Typal equality of terms is also called the **equality type**, **identity type**, **path type**, or **identification type**, and the terms of typal equality are called **equalities**, **identities**, **identifications**, **paths**. Notable examples of typal equality of terms include the [[identity type]] in [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] and [[higher observational type theory]], and the [[cubical path type]] in [[cubical type theory]]. Typal equality of types is also called **[[equivalence of types]]**, are written as $A \simeq B$ for types $A$ and $B$ and are definable in all type theories with typal equality of terms, [[function types]], [[dependent product types]], and [[dependent sum types]]. 

Type theories with only typal equality are called [[objective type theories]]. In type theories with both typal equality and either judgmental equality or propositional equality, one could distinguish between [[intensional type theories]] and [[extensional type theories]]: extensional type theories are type theories with an equality reflection rule, where one could derive judgmental or propositional equality of terms from typal equality of terms:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b}{\Gamma \vdash a \equiv b:A} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b}{\Gamma \vdash a \equiv_A b \; \mathrm{true}}$$

Intensional type theories are then type theories with typal equality and one of either judgmental or propositional equality without an equality reflection rule. Note that this notion of extensionality is different from the [[axiom of extensionality]] or [[function extensionality]]. 

### Comparison of equalities

This table gives the six different notions of equality found in type theory. 

| Judgment | of types | of terms |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Judgmental equality | $\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{type}$ | $\Gamma \vdash a = b:A$ |
| Propositional equality | $\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{true}$ | $\Gamma \vdash a =_A b \; \mathrm{true}$ |
| Typal equality | $\Gamma \vdash P:A \simeq B$ | $\Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b$ |

## Structural rules of equalities

### Reflexivity

The reflexivity of equality is given by the following judgmental, propositional, and typal rules respectively:

* Reflexivity of judgmental equality

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash A = A \; \mathrm{type}}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash a = a:A}$$

* Reflexivity of propositional equality

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash a =_A a \; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Reflexitivity of typal equality (i.e. [[identity function]] and identity [[path]])
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash id_{A}:A \simeq A}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{refl}_{A}(a):a =_A a}$$

### Symmetry

The symmetry of equality is given by the following judgmental, propositional, and typal rules respectively:

* Symmetry of judgmental equality
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash B = A \; \mathrm{type}}$$ 
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a = b:A}{\Gamma \vdash b = a:A}$$

* Symmetry of propositional equality
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{true}}{\Gamma \vdash B = A \; \mathrm{true}}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:A \quad \Gamma \vdash a =_A b \; \mathrm{true}}{\Gamma \vdash b =_A a \; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Symmetry of typal equality (i.e. [[inverse function]] and inverse path)
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash P:A \simeq B}{\Gamma \vdash P^{-1}:B \simeq A}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:A \quad \Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b}{\Gamma \vdash p^{-1}:b =_A a}$$

### Transitivity

The transitivity of equality is given by the following judgmental, propositional, and typal rules respectively:

* Transitivity of judgmental equality
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B = C \; \mathrm{type} }{\Gamma \vdash A = C \; \mathrm{type}}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a = b:A \quad b = c:A }{\Gamma \vdash a = c:A}$$

* Transitivity of propositional equality
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{true} \quad \Gamma \vdash B = C \; \mathrm{true}}{\Gamma \vdash A = C \; \mathrm{true}}$$ 
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:A \quad \Gamma \vdash c:A \quad \Gamma \vdash a =_A b \; \mathrm{true} \quad \Gamma \vdash b =_A c \; \mathrm{true}}{\Gamma \vdash a =_A c \; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Transitivity of typal equality (i.e. [[composition]] of functions and path concatenation)
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash P:A \simeq B \quad \Gamma \vdash Q:B \simeq C}{\Gamma \vdash Q \circ P:A \simeq C}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:A \quad \Gamma \vdash c:A \quad \Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b \quad \Gamma \vdash q:b =_A c}{\Gamma \vdash p \bullet q:a =_A c}$$

### Principle of substituting equals for equals 

The [[principle of substituting equals for equals]] is given by the following judgmental, propositional, and typal rules respectively:

* Substitution of judgmentally equal terms:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a = b : A \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, \Delta[b/x] \vdash B[a/x] = B[b/x] \; \mathrm{type}}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a = b : A \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash c:B}{\Gamma, \Delta[b/x] \vdash c[a/x] = c[b/x]: B[b/x]}$$

* Substitution of propositionally equal terms:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a : A \quad \Gamma \vdash b : A \quad \Gamma \vdash a =_A b \; \mathrm{true} \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, \Delta[b/x] \vdash B[a/x] = B[b/x] \; \mathrm{true}}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a : A \quad \Gamma \vdash b : A \quad \Gamma \vdash a =_A b \; \mathrm{true} \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash c:B}{\Gamma, \Delta[b/x] \vdash c[a/x] =_{B[b/x]} c[b/x] \; \mathrm{true}}$$

* Substitution of typally equal terms (i.e. [[transport]] and [[action on identifications]]):
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:A \quad \Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash B \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, \Delta[b/x] \vdash \mathrm{tr}(x.B, a, b, p):B[a/x] \simeq B[b/x]}$$
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:A \quad \Gamma \vdash p:a =_A b \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash c:B}{\Gamma, \Delta[b/x] \vdash \mathrm{ap}(c, x.B, a, b, p):\mathrm{tr}(x.B, a, b, p)(c[a/x]) =_{B[b/x]} c[b/x]}$$

### Variable conversion

The variable conversion rule is given by the following judgmental, propositional, and typal rules respectively:

* Judgmental variable conversion rule:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash \mathcal{J}}{\Gamma, x:B, \Delta \vdash \mathcal{J}}$$

* Propositional variable conversion rule:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash A = B \; \mathrm{true} \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash \mathcal{J}}{\Gamma, x:B, \Delta \vdash \mathcal{J}}$$

* Typal variable conversion rule:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash P:A \simeq B \quad \Gamma, x:A, \Delta \vdash \mathcal{J}}{\Gamma, y:B, \Delta[P^{-1}(y)/x] \vdash \mathcal{J}[P^{-1}(y)/x]}$$

$\mathcal{J}$ is a generic judgment thesis. 

## Usages of equality

### In definitions of types and terms

The three different notions of equality above could be used in [[definitions]] of [[types]] and [[terms]], as well as in the rules for the [[single assignment operator]] $\coloneqq$. In [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] and [[cubical type theory]], judgmental equality is used for definitional equality. In [[ZFC]] and [[ETCS]], propositional equality is used for definitional equality, and in [[objective type theories]], typal equality is used for definitional equality. 

### In conversion rules and inductive definitions

The three different notions of equality above could also be used in the [[conversion rules]] for the various type formers, such as [[beta conversion]] or [[eta conversion]], where the equality is called **[[conversional equality]]** or **computational equality**. Computational equality is important because it is the equality used in [[inductive definitions]]. In [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] and [[cubical type theory]], judgmental equality is used for computational equality, and in [[objective type theories]], typal equality is used for computational equality. 

## Meta-equalities

There are also equalities in [[type theory]] which are not internal to the type theory itself, but rather equalties in the metatheroy. These include **syntactic equality** of expressions, as well as **[[alpha-equivalence]]** and **[[definitional equality]]** of syntactical expressions. When using [[de Bruijn indices]], alpha-equivalence is the same as syntactic equality, but when using [[variables]], alpha-equivalence is different from syntactic equality: rather alpha-equivalence is equality up to the renaming of [[bound variables]]. All type theories, like [[MLTT]], [[cubical type theory]], [[ZFC]], and [[ETCS]], have syntactic equality, alpha-equivalence, and definitional equality of syntactical expressions, including the type theories which lack [[judgmental equality]] like [[objective type theories]]. 

## Equality in constructive and classical mathematics

Constructive mathematics is mathematics in which the law of excluded middle does not necessarily hold for [[propositions]], [[subsingletons]], or [[h-propositions]]. Classical mathematics is matheamtics in which the law of excluded middle does hold for [[propositions]], [[subsingletons]], or [[h-propositions]]. Here, we take equality to mean either typal or propositional equality, so that equality is a relation or a type family on a type or set. 

In classical mathematics, equality of sets is a [[stable relation|stable]] [[equivalence relation]], and [[denial inequality]] of sets is a [[tight apartness relation]]. However, in constructive mathematics, equality cannot be proven to be stable for all sets, and denial inequality cannot be proven to be a tight apartness relation for all sets. Instead, one could distinguish between 4 different notions of equality and [[inequality]]:

* [[tight apartness relations]]. However, not all sets have tight apartness relations. The sets which do are called [[inequality spaces]]. 

* equality, which is an [[equivalence relation]]; [[inequality spaces]] have [[stable equality]]. 

* [[denial inequality]], which can only be proven to be a [[weakly tight]] [[irreflexive symmetric relation]]. However, all statements in classical mathematics involving only denial inequalities hold in constructive mathematics, by the [[double negation translation]] and the property that for any proposition $P$, $\neg \neg \neg P$ if and only if $\neg P$. 

* the [[double negation]] of equality, which can only be proven to be a [[stable relation|stable]] [[reflexive symmetric relation]]. However, all statements in classical mathematics involving only equality hold in constructive mathematics with the equality replaced by its double negation, by the [[double negation translation]]. 

The sets in which equality and inequality behaves as it does in [[classical mathematics]] are the sets with [[decidable equality]]. 

As a result, in constructive mathematics, sometimes one takes [[inequality spaces]] instead of general [[sets]] to be the foundational primitive concept. In classical mathematics, this is unnecessary, because every [[set]] is an [[inequality space]]. 

## Internal equality in set theory

Relations and equality could be [[internal logic of set theory|internalized in any set theory]]: the internal equality in set theory is the smallest internal [[reflexive relation]] on $S$, and it is in fact an internal [[equivalence relation]]; it is the only internal equivalence relation on $S$ that is also a [[partial order]] (although that fact is somewhat circular).  This relation is often called the __identity relation__ on $S$, either because 'identity' can mean 'equality' or because it is the [[identity]] for [[composition]] of relations. 

In the [[category]] of reflexive relations on $S$, the [[equality relation]] on $S$ is an [[initial object|initial reflexive relation]]; when the equality relation is a [[type family]] instead of a family of propositions, then the equality relation is the initial type generated by reflexivity or the [[first law of thought]].

As a [[subset]] of $S \times S$, the equality relation is often called the __[[diagonal]]__ and written $\Delta_S$ or similarly.  As an abstract set, this subset is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $S$ itself, so one also sees the diagonal as a map, the [[diagonal function]] $S \overset{\Delta_S}\to S \times S$, which maps $x$ to $(x,x)$; note that $x = x$.  This is in [[Set]]; analogous [[diagonal morphisms]] exist in any [[cartesian monoidal category]].
