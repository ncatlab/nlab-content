## Idea

In [[physics]] given two [[physical system]] their _composite_ is meant to be both systems regarded as a single system, but trivially so, without the two interacting.

In [[classical mechanics]] forming a composite in this sense amounts to taking the [[cartesian product]] of their [[phase spaces]].

In [[quantum mechanics]] forming the composite amounts to taking the (non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]]) [[tensor product]] of the [[spaces of quantum states]], hence their "[[multiplicative conjunction]]" in the language of [[linear logic]]/[[quantum logic]]. The non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] nature of this [[tensor product]] is the source of the phenomenon of [[quantum entanglement]] and all that goes with this (cf. the *[[EPR paradox]]* and *[[Bell's inequalities]]* but also phenomena like *[[quantum materials]]* and *[[topological order]]*).
