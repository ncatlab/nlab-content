## Idea

The [[moduli stack]] $\mathcal{M}_{FG}$ of all [[formal groups]].

## Properties

### Chromatic height stratification

The moduli stack of formal groups $\mathcal{M}_{FG}$ admits a natural [[stratification]] whose open [[strata]] are labeled by a [[natural number]] called the _[[height of a formal group|height of formal groups]]_.

The [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] associated to these [[formal groups]] by the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]] accordingly also inherit such an integer label, called _[[chromatic filtration]]_. Studying this is the topic of [[chromatic homotopy theory]].
