## Idea

**Displayed type theory** is a [[modal type theory]] which synthetically models an $(\infty,1)$-topos and the corresponding $(\infty,1)$-category of Reedy fibrant augmented semi-simplicial diagrams of objects in the $(\infty,1)$-topos. It has partial internal unary parametricity via a display operation given by [[inference rules]], and the display can be used to construct [[semi-simplicial types]] as a [[coinductive type]] in the type theory.
