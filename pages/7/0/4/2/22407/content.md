## Idea

The [[trivial ring]], among all unital rings, has two characteristic properties:

1. there is a *unique* [[function]] *into* the trivial ring, from any other unital ring;

1. there is *no* [[function]] *from* the trivial ring, except to itself.

The first property generalizes to arbitrary [[categories]] as the property of a *[[terminal object]]*.

The corresponding generalization including also the second property is that of a *strict terminal object*:


## Definition

A [[terminal object]] $\mathbf{1}$ is called a **strict terminal object** if every [[morphism]] [[domain|from]] $\mathbf{1}$ is an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  \mathbf{1} 
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \X
  \,.
$$

In other words, a strict terminal object is a [[maximal object|maximal terminal object]].


## Examples
 {#Examples}

* Trivial unital ring

* Trivial [[Boolean algebra]]

* In general, for any algebraic theory with two constants $0$ and $1$ and a binary operation for which $0$ is a (left) absorbing element and $1$ is a (left) unit, the trivial model is strictly terminal.
