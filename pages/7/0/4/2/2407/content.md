## Idea
__Propositional logic__, also called __$0$th-order logic__ and __sentential logic__, is that part of [[logic]] that deals only with [[propositions]] with no bound variables.  

Compare [[predicate logic]], or $1$st-order logic, and [[higher-order logic]].  Note that while one can have *free* variables in $0$th-order logic, one cannot really do anything with them; each $P(x)$ in a $0$th-order proposition might as well be thought of as atomic.

A __propositional calculus__, also called __sentential calculus__, is simply a system for describing and working with propositional logic.  The precise form of such a calculus (and hence of the logic itself) depends on whether one is using [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]], [[linear logic]], etc; see those articles for details.
