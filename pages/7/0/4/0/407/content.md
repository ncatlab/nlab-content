The **globe category** $G$ is
the category whose objects are the integers and
whose morphisms are generated from
$$
  \sigma_n : [n] \to [n+1]
$$
$$
  \tau_n : [n] \to [n+1]
$$
$$
  \iota_n : [n+1] \to [n]
$$
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ subject to the relations (dropping obvious subscripts)
$$
  \sigma\circ \sigma = \tau \circ \sigma
$$
$$
  \sigma\circ \tau = \tau \circ \tau
$$
$$
  \iota \circ \sigma = \mathrm{Id}
$$
$$
  \iota \circ \tau = \mathrm{Id}
  \,.
