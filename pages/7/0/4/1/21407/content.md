## Idea

The [[Maxwell equations]] were originally formulated on 4-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]], but in their formulation where the [[Faraday tensor]] is regarded as a [[differential 2-form]] $F$ with [[Hodge dual]] $\star F$ and [[de Rham differentials]]

$$
  \array{
    d F & = 0
    \\
    \star d F & = J
  }
$$

they immediately generalize to make sense on [[Minkowski spacetime]] of any dimension $D$, and in fact to any [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. The case of $D =5$-Maxwell theory plays a role mostly as a subsector of [[D=5 Einstein-Maxwell theory]] and/or of [[D=5 super Yang-Mills theory]], as well as a pre-image under [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of [[massive Yang-Mills theory]] in 4-dimensions.
