##Idea 

Generalising a [[Klein geometry]], a **locally Klein geometry** is a triple $(\Gamma, G,H)$  where  $(G, H)$ is a [[homogeneous space]] ($G/H$ not necessarily connected), and $\Gamma \subset G$ is a discrete subgroup acting by left multiplication on the [[coset space]] $G/H$ as a group of [[covering transformations]] with the [[double coset space]], $\Gamma \backslash G/H$, [[connected]] (Def. 3.10 of [Sharpe 97](#Sharpe97)).
