##Idea 

Generalising a [[Klein geometry]], a **locally Klein geometry** is a triple $(\Gamma, G,H)$  where  $G$ is a [[Lie group]], $H \subset G$ is a closed  subgroup, and $\Gamma \subset G$ is a subgroup acting by left multiplication on the [[coset space]] $G/H$ as a group of [[covering transformations]] with the [[double coset space]], $\Gamma \backslash G/H$, [[connected]] (Def. 3.10 of [Sharpe 97](#Sharpe97)).

A locally Klein geometry is a [[Cartan geometry]] with the left invariant [[Maurer-Cartan form]] of $G$ as [[Cartan connection]].
