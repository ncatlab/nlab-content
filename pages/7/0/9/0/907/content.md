I am a mathematical physicist/mathematician from Zagreb. My Ph.D. is from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2002. My native toungue is the kajkavian dialect of Croatian.
In Croatian we use diacritics for the sch-sound: &#352;koda.

My web page is [here](http://www.irb.hr/korisnici/zskoda).

Hi Zoran, you should know that, because redirects don\'t work as smoothly here as they do in Wikipedia, we usually don\'t create redirects from synonyms that haven\'t been used, and we don\'t link to redirects that do exist.  In fact, we\'ve been putting them in `category: delete` if they have no content in the history (although I think that it\'s unlikely that these will ever be deleted).

By the way, I think that the usual rule against non-ASCII characters in page names probably shouldn\'t really apply to people\'s names, so feel free to move this to [[Zoran Å koda]] if you like.
