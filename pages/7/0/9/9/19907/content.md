## Statement 

The [[little n-disk operad]] is [[formal dg-algebra|formal]] in the sense that for each of its component [[topological spaces]] there is a [[zig-zag]] of [[quasi-isomorphisms]] between their [[de Rham cohomology]] and their [[de Rham complex]], and such that these morphisms are compatible with the induced [[cooperad]]-[[structure]] on both sides.

Concretely, the [[zig-zags]] may be taken to consist of one [[span]] of [[quasi-isomorphisms]] out of a suitable [[graph complex]] to the [[de Rham cohomology]]/[[de Rham complex]] of the [[Fulton-MacPherson operad]], which in turn is [[weak equivalence|weakly equivalent]] to the [[little n-disk operad]] ([this Prop.](Fulton-MacPherson+operad#WeakEquivalenceToLittleNDiskOperad)).

Here the morphism from the [[graph complex]] to the [[de Rham complex]] of the [[Fulton-MacPherson operad]] regards the latter as the [[compactification]] of a [[configuration space of points]], regards [[functions]]/[[differential forms]] on [[configuration spaces of points]] as [[n-point functions]] of a [[topological quantum field theory|topological]] [[quantum field theory]], regards suitable [[graphs]] as [[Feynman diagrams]] and proceeds by sending each such graph/Feynman diagram to a corresponding [[Feynman amplitude]].

This idea of a proof was sketched in [Kontsevich 99](#Kontsevich99), a full account is due to [Lambrechts-Volic 14](#LambrechtsVolic14).
