## Idea

A _hyperbolic space_ is the analog of a [[Euclidean space]] as one passes from [[Euclidean geometry]] to [[hyperbolic geometry]]. The generalization of the concept of [[hyperbolic plane]] to higher [[dimension]].

A _hyperbolic manifold_ is a [[geodesic completeness|geodesically complete]] [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ of [[constant function|constant]] [[sectional curvature]] $-1$.

Of particular interest are [[hyperbolic 3-manifold|hyperbolic 3-manifolds]].

## Properties

### Zeta functions

There are canonical [[zeta functions]] associated with suitable (odd-dimensional) hyperbolic manifolds, see at _[[Selberg zeta function]]_ and _[[Ruelle zeta function]]_.


### Mostow rigidity theorem

The [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] states that every [[hyperbolic manifold]] of [[dimension]] $\geq 3$ and of [[finite number|finite]] [[volume]] is uniquely determined by its [[fundamental group]].


## Examples

* [[hyperbolic 3-space]]


## Related concepts

A Riemannian manifold 

* with zero sectional curvature is a [[Euclidean manifold]];

* with +1 sectional curvature is an [[elliptic manifold]]
