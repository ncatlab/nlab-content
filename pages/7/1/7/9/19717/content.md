## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[computer science]], originally in [[database theory]], a data [[structure]]-[[type]] now called (lawful) *lenses* &lbrack;[Bohannon, Pierce & Vaughan (2006, §3)](#BohannonPierceVaughan06), [Foster, Greenwald, Moore, Pierce & Schmitt  (2007, §3)](#FosterGreenwaldMoorePierceSchmitt07), but considered under different names already by [Oles 1982](#Oles82), [1986](#Oles86) and [Hofmann & Pierce 1996](#HofmannPierce96)&rbrack;
is used to encode [[data]]([[database|-base]]) types $S$ equipped with a read/write functionality (only) for a specified view-type $V$.

In particular, "very well-behaved" or "lawful" lenses (see Def. \ref{Lens} below) -- those for which updates of the "view" $V$ completely overwrite any previous such changes -- turn out to equivalently be data base types of product form $S = D \times V$ with "view" given by projecting onto the $V$-factor.  As such, lawful lenses are equivalent to (cf. *[[monads in computer science]]*):

* the [[module over a monad|modales]] over the $V$-[[possibility]]-monad 

  ([Johnson, Rosebrugh & Wood 2010, Prop. 9](#JohnsonRosebrughWood10), see Prop. \ref{LawfulLensesArePossibilityModales} below)

* the [[comodule over a comonad|comodales]] over the [[costate comonad]],  

  ([O’Connor (2010)](#O’Connor10), [(2011)](#O’Connor11), see Prop. \ref{LensesAreCostateCoalgebras} below).

Thus, lawful lenses may be thought of as encoding read/write functionality (only) at a certain address in a data base (compare the [[RAM]]-model given by the [[state monad]] which encodes read/write of the entire data base type at once).
 
More generally, there are two different approaches to lenses:

* Lawful lenses (as above) are an algebraic structure which axiomatize product projections. The laws govern the ways views and updates relate. These are generalized into [[delta lens|Delta lenses]], which are more flexible lawful lenses.

* Lawless lenses, and in particular bi-directional or polymorphic lenses, separate the two directions of view and update so that the laws no longer type-check. These lawless lenses are used to organize bi-directional flow of data, and are generalized into [[optics (in computer science)|optics]] in the [[functional programming]] literature. 

An alternate generalization of lawless lenses is put forward in [Spivak 19](#Spivak19) as the [[Grothendieck construction]] of the fiberwise dual of an [[indexed category]]. This notion of lawless lens has been adopted in the context of [[categorical systems theory]] because they represent a *bidirectional stateful computation* which describes the way some systems expose and update their internal state. For instance, see [Myers](#Myers), [Spivak & Niu](#SpivakPoly) or [Hedges (2021)](#Hedges21).

In this sense, lawless lenses are applications of two mathematical frameworks which are interesting in their own right: [[fibration|fibrations]] and [[optics (in computer science)|optics]] (thus [[Tambara module|Tambara modules]]).



## Definition
 {#Definition}

\begin{definition}\label{Lens}
**(lenses)**
\linebreak
Given a [[category]] $(\mathbf{C}, 1, \times)$  with [[finite products]], a *lens* in $\mathbf{C}$ is:

1. a [[pair]] of [[objects]] of $\mathbf{C}$

   1. ("source") 

      $$S \,\in\, \mathbf{C}$$
   
   1. ("view") 

      $$V \,\in\, \mathbf{C}$$

1. a [[pair]] of [[morphisms]] of the form

   1. ("view", "read-out", "forward operation") 

      $$
        \mathrm{get} 
          \;\colon\; 
        S \longrightarrow V
      $$ 

   1. ("update", "write", "backward operation") 

      $$
        \mathrm{put} 
          \;\colon\; 
        V \times S \longrightarrow S
        \,.
      $$ 

The lens is called *well-behaved* if this data satisfies:

* (PutGet) "what has just been written is read out as such": 

  $$
    v \colon V
    ,\,
    s \colon S
    \;\;\;\;\;\;
    \vdash
    \;\;\;\;\;\;
    get\big(
      put 
     (v,\,s) 
    \big)
    \;=\; 
    v
    \,,
  $$

and

* (GetPut) "writing what has just been read out means no change":

  $$
    s \colon S
    \;\;\;\;\;\;
    \vdash
    \;\;\;\;\;\;
    put\big(
      get(s) 
      ,\,
      s
    \big)   
    \;=\;
    s
  $$

and it is called *very well-behaved* or *lawful* if in addition it satisfies:

* (PutPut) "writing means to over-write previous edits":

  $$
    v,\,v' \colon V
    ,\;
    s \colon S
    \;\;\;\;\;\;
    \vdash
    \;\;\;\;\;\;
    put\Big(
      v',\,
      put\big(
        v,\, s 
      \big)
    \Big)
    \;=\;
    put(v',\, s)
  $$

\end{definition}

Definition \ref{Lens} appears, under no particular name, in [Hofmann & Pierce 1996, p. 12](#HofmannPierce96), where it is thought of as providing aspects of [[object-oriented programming]]: Here one thinks of $S$ as a "class" which inherts functionality from the class $V$. And indeed, for lawful lenses it follows (see [below](#PossibilityMonadicity)) that $S \simeq D \times V$ is a "record" which inherits all fields present in $V$ but may add some more).

The terminology "lens" for Def. \ref{Lens}
is due to [Bohannon, Pierce & Vaughan 2006, Def. 3.2](#BohannonPierceVaughan06). 



## The category of lenses

Lenses (regardless of their lawfulness) organize in a category $\mathrm{Lens}(\mathbf C)$ whose objects are the same as $\mathbf C$ and whose morphisms $X \to Y$ are lenses with states $X$ and views $Y$. The identity lens is given by $(1_X, \pi_1) :X \to X$. Composition of $(\mathrm{get}_1, \mathrm{put}_{1}):X \to Y$ and $(\mathrm{get}_2, \mathrm{put}_{2}):Y \to Z$ is given by:
$$
  \mathrm{get}_{12} = \mathrm{get}_2 \circ \mathrm{get}_1
$$
$$
  \mathrm{put}_{12} = \mathrm{put}_1 \circ ((\mathrm{put}_2 \circ (1_Z \times \mathrm{get}_1)) \times 1_X) \circ (1_Z \times \Delta_X)
$$
The $\mathrm{put}_{12}$ morphism is probably easier to describe using generalized elements:
$$
  \mathrm{put}_{12} : (z,x) \mapsto \mathrm{put}_1(\mathrm{put}_2(z, \mathrm{get}_1(x)), x)
$$

\begin{remark}
Crucially, associativity of this composition relies on [[monoidal category with diagonals|naturality of the diagonals]], which is a given in cartesian categories but not in more general monoidal categories. [[optic (in computer science)|Optics]] are a sweeping generalization of lenses which overcomes this obstacle.
\end{remark}

Moreover, the [[cartesian product]] of $\mathbf C$ endows $\mathrm{Lens}(\mathbf{C})$ of a [[monoidal product]].


## Properties 

### Monadicity over Possibility monad
 {#PossibilityMonadicity}

\begin{proposition}
\label{LawfulLensesArePossibilityModales}
**(lawful lenses are possibility modales)**
\linebreak
Lawful lenses in $\mathbf{C}$ with view $V$ (Def. \ref{Lens})
are equivalently the [[module of a monad|modules]] ([[modales]]) of the left [[base change]] [[monad]] on the [[slice category]] over $V$ (the $V$-[possibility](necessity+and+possibility#globally)-[[modality]] $\lozenge_V$):

\[
  \label{PossibilityMonadOverTheViewObject}
\]
\begin{tikzcd}
  \mathbf{C}
  \ar[
    r,
    shift right=8pt,
    "{
      \times V
    }"{swap}
  ]
  \ar[
    from=r,
    shift right=8pt,
    "{
      \coprod_{V}
    }"{swap}
  ]
  \ar[
    r,
    phantom,
    "{ \scalebox{.7}{$\bot$} }"
  ]
  &
  \mathbf{C}_{/V}

      shorten=-3pt,
      "{
        \lozenge_{V}
      }"{description},
    ]  
\end{tikzcd}

where 

1. $view \,\colon\, S \to V$ is identified with the slicing morphism,

1. $get \,\colon\, V \times S \to S$ is identified with the module action $\lozenge_V(S) \to S$.

\end{proposition} 
([Johnson, Rosebrugh & Wood 2010, Prop. 9](#JohnsonRosebrughWood10))
\begin{proof}
\label{ProofOfLawfulLensesArePossibilityModales}
By direct unwinding of the definitions:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "LawfulLensesAsPossibilityModales-230613.jpg",
    "width": 800,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 10,
        "right": 10, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
\label{LawfulLensesMonadicity}
  If the ambient category $\mathbf{C}$ is a [[topos]] (such as [[Sets]]) and the view $V$ is [[inhabited object|inhabited]],  then the adjunction (eq:PossibilityMonadOverTheViewObject) is [[monadic functor|monadic]].
\end{proposition}
For the case $\mathbf{C} = Sets$ this is [Johnson, Rosebrugh & Wood 2010, Thm. 12, Cor. 13](#JohnsonRosebrughWood10).
\begin{proof}
 The [[monadicity theorem]] ([here](monadicity+theorem#BeckMonadicityTheoremAlternative)) readily gives that the above adjunction (eq:PossibilityMonadOverTheViewObject) is [[monadic functor]]: $(\text{-})\times V$ [[preserved colimit|preserves]] all colimits (cf. [[universal colimits]]) hence in particular the relevant [[coequalizers]], and it is [[conservative functor|conservative]] by the assumption that $V$ is inhabited (this is clear by inspection in [[Sets]] -- which is what [JRW10](#JohnsonRosebrughWood10) observe on their p. 13 --  for the general case use [[Sketches of an Elephant|Johnstone 2002, vol 1, Lem. 1.3.2]]).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{MonadicityOfLawfulLensesAsMonadicDescent}
**(relation to [[monadic descent]])**
\linebreak
In ([[algebraic geometry|algebraic]]) [[geometry]], the statement of Prop. \ref{LawfulLensesMonadicity} is known as *[[monadic descent]]*. In this context one would say that:

* the [[epimorphism]] $V \to \ast$ (reflecting that $V$ is [[inhabited objects|inhabited]], necessarily an [[effective epimorphism]] given that $\mathbf{C}$ is assumed to be a [[topos]]) is the *morphism of effective descent*, representing a [[covering]],

* $\lozenge_V$-[[modale]]-[[structure]] is *[[descent data]]* on the [[underlying]] object in $\mathbf{C}_{/V}$,

* the [[Eilenberg-Moore category|EM-category]] $\big(\mathbf{C}_{/V}\big)^{\lozenge_V}$ is the *[[category of descent data]]* along $V \to \ast$,

and so the monadicity theorem $\mathbf{C} \,\simeq\, \big(\mathbf{C}_{/V}\big)^{\lozenge_V}$ in Prop. \ref{LawfulLensesMonadicity} states that objects over $V$ which are equipped with such descent data are equivalent to objects over $\ast$, hence "do descend" along $V \to \ast$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
**(relation to [[epistemic logic]])**
\linebreak
Prop. \ref{LawfulLensesMonadicity} says that the category of $\lozenge_V$-[[modales]] among objects in $\mathbf{C}_{/V}$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{C}$. This makes good sense when viewing $\lozenge_V$ as the [[possibility]]-[[modality]], see the discussion of *potentiality* [there](necessity+and+possibility#RelationToPotentiality).
\end{remark}


### Monadicity over the CoState comonad
 {#MonadicityOverStateMonade}

Alternatively:

\begin{proposition}\label{LensesAreCostateCoalgebras}
**(lawful lenses are the [[costate comonad|costate]] [[coalgebra over a comonad|coalgebras]])**

For $\mathbf{C}$ a [[cartesian closed category]],  the lawful $V$-lenses in $\mathbf{C}$ (Def. \ref{Lens}) are equivalently the [[coalgebra over a comonad|coalgebras]] of the $V$-[[costate comonad|CoState]] [[comonad]],  i.e. that induced by the [[internal hom]]-[[adjoint functor|adjunction]]: 

\begin{centre}

\begin{tikzcd}
  \mathbf{C} 
  \arrow[r, shift right=7pt, "{[V, -]}"', "\bot"] 
    \ar[out=135, in=-135,
      looseness=5.1, 
      shorten=-3pt,
      "{
        V\mathrm{CoState}
      }"{description},
    ]  
   & 
  \mathbf{C} 
  \arrow[l, shift right=7pt, "{(-) \times V}"']
\end{tikzcd}

\end{centre}
 
\end{proposition}
This is due to [O’Connor (2010)](#O’Connor10),  [O’Connor (2011)](#O’Connor11), for further discussion see  [Gibbons & Johnson (2012), Section 3.2](#GibbonsJohnson12).

## Generalizations

There are many generalizations of lenses which have been proposed, however they can be broadly classified into those which satisfy analogues of the _lens laws_, and those without any axioms or laws. 

### Lenses without laws

* One generalization considers the lenses from the previous section as _monomorphic_ by contrast to _polymorphic_ lens which go between pairs of types, $\lambda: (S, T) \to (A, B)$, consisting of a view function, $v_{\lambda}: S \to A$, and an update function $u_{\lambda}: S \times B \to T$. Without further conditions, these are known as _bimorphic lenses_. To impose conditions comparable to the lens laws above requires that the types be related.

These sorts of lenses are generalized by [Spivak 19](#Spivak19). For a quick explanation of how these sorts of generalized lenses are of use in systems theory, see [Myers20](#Myers20); for a longer explanation, see Chapter 2 of [Myers](#Myers).

* An [[optic (in computer science)|optic]] generalizes the way lenses 'remember' state from the forward part to the backward part, avoiding the necessity of a cartesian structure by swapping it with a sufficiently rich actegorical context.

### Lenses with laws

* [[delta lens|Delta lenses]] are a generalization which does satisfy laws. Here we have categories $S$ and $V$ called the source and view, together with a *Get* functor $g : S \to V$ and a function $\varphi \colon S_{0} \times_{V_{0}} V_{1} \to S_{1}$ which takes a pair $(s \in S, u : g s \to v \in V)$ to a morphism 
$\varphi(s, u) : s \to p(s, u)$ in $S$ where $p(s, u) = cod(\varphi(a, u))$ is the *Put* function. The function $\varphi$ must also satisfy three lens laws. When $S$ and $V$ are [[indiscrete category|codiscrete categories]], delta lenses are equivalent to a lens in [[Set]]; see ([Johnson-Rosebrugh 2016, Proposition 4](#JohnsonRosebrugh16)). 

* A morphism between directed [[polynomial functor|containers]] is another kind of generalised lens satisfying laws called _update-update lenses_; see ([Ahman-Uustalu 2017, Section 5](#AhmanUustalu17)). These are equivalent to [[cofunctor|cofunctors]].
