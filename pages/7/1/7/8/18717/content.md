##Idea

A [[categorification]] of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] appears in ([Dyckerhoff17](#Dyckerhoff17)), where [[Ab]], the category of abelian groups, is replaced by the [[(∞,2)-category]] of [[stable (∞, 1)-categories]]. 

The equivalence between simplicial abelian groups and connective chain complexes becomes an equivalence between 2-simplicial stable (∞,1)-categories and connective chain complexes of stable ∞-categories.

This should lead to a categorified version of [[homological algebra]] and of [[cohomology]], for example, through a categorified version of an [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum]].
