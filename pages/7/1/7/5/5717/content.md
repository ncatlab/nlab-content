## Idea

_Differential calculus_ is one of the two halves of the [[infinitesimal]] calculus, the other being [[integral]] calculus.  (The two are linked by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].)  The differential calculus was developed in the 18th century by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (acting independently).

In modern terms, the original differential calculus describes the behaviour of [[dfferentiation]] of [[smooth function|function]]s on the [[real line]].  From here, we move to the study of [[differential equation]]s and then to [[differential geometry]] ([[de Rham complex]]) and eventually generalize to a wide class of analogous situations (see for instance [[synthetic differential geometry]] and [[D-modules]]).

Differential calculus on non-finite dimensional spaces is also known as [[variational calculus]].

In the presence of [[Lie algebra]] [[action]]s a variant of differential caclulus is [[Cartan calculus]].

Since [[Hochschild homology]] and [[cyclic homology]] (see there) is closely related to differential forms and de Rham differentials, generalizations and abstractions of Hochschild (co)homology are also used as generalized _differential calculi_ .
