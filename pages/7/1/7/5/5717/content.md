_Differential calculus_ is the formalism that describes the behaviour of [[differential]]s, originally in the study of [[differential equation]]s and then in [[differential geometry]] ([[de Rham complex]]) and eventually generalized to a wide class of analogous situations (see for instance [[synthetic differential geometry]] and [[D-modules]]).

Differential calculus on non-finite dimensional spaces is also known as [[variational calculus]].

In the presence of [[Lie algebra]] [[action]]s a variant of differential caclulus is [[Cartan calculus]].

Since [[Hochschild homology]] and [[cyclic homology]] (see there) is closely related to differential forms and de Rham differentials, generalizations and abstractions of Hochschild (co)homology are also used as generalized _differential calculi_ .
