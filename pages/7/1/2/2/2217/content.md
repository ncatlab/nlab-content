The _n_-Lab is currently experiencing some difficulties due to local fluctuations in reality.
The [[lab elf|Lab Elves]] are working hard to patch reality.
In the meantime, edits on the _n_-Lab have been temporarily disabled since the fundamentals of mathematics may vary during these spasmodic variations.
Normal service will be restored once we are sure what "normal" is.
