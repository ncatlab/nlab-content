## Idea

An ordered field is a [[field]] equipped with a compatible [[strict total order]].

Note that while the adjective 'ordered' usually refers to a [[partial order]], it is traditionally used more strictly when placed before 'field'.


## Definition

Classically: 

An __ordered field__ is a [[field]] $K$ equipped with a [[strict total order]] $\lt$ such that 

* $0 \lt 1$

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$ implies that $0 \lt a + b$; alternatively, $0 \lt a + b$ implies that $0 \lt a$ or $0 \lt b$. 

* for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then $0 \lt a \cdot b$

One often sees the definition using a weak [[total order]] $\leq$ instead of the strict total order $\lt$. This makes no difference in [[classical mathematics]], but the definition of the strict total order is the one that generalizes to [[constructive mathematics]]. 

An ordered field could also be defined as a [[field]] with a [[predicate]] $\mathrm{isPositive}$ such that 

* zero is not positive: 

$$\not \mathrm{isPositive}(0)$$

* one is positive: 

$$\mathrm{isPositive}(1)$$

* for every element $a:A$, if $a$ is not positive and $-a$ is not positive, then $a = 0$

$$\forall a:A.\neg\mathrm{isPositive}(a) \wedge \neg\mathrm{isPositive}(-a) \Rightarrow (a = 0)$$

* for every term $a:A$, if $a$ is positive, then $-a$ is not positive. 

$$\forall a:A. \forall b:A. \mathrm{isPositive}(a) \Rightarrow \neg\mathrm{isPositive}(-a)$$

* for every term $a:A$, $b:A$, if $a$ is positive, then either $b$ is positive or $a - b$ is positive. 

$$\forall a:A. \forall b:A. \mathrm{isPositive}(a) \Rightarrow \left(\mathrm{isPositive}(b) \vee \mathrm{isPositive}(a - b)\right)$$

* for every term $a:A$, $b:A$, if $a$ is positive and $b$ is positive, then $a + b$ is positive

$$\forall a:A. \forall b:A. \mathrm{isPositive}(a) \wedge \mathrm{isPositive}(b) \Rightarrow \mathrm{isPositive}(a + b)$$

* for every term $a:A$, $b:A$, if $a$ is positive and $b$ is positive, then $a \cdot b$ is positive

$$\forall a:A. \forall b:A. \mathrm{isPositive}(a) \wedge \mathrm{isPositive}(b) \implies \mathrm{isPositive}(a \cdot b)$$

The strict total order is defined as
$$a \lt b \coloneqq \mathrm{isPositive}(b - a)$$

### In constructive mathematics

In constructive mathematics, [[denial inequality]] is no longer a [[tight apartness relation]], and neither relation, is a [[decidable relation]]. Thus, the concept of a [[field]] splits into multiple separate notions, *[[discrete fields]]*, *[[Heyting fields]]*, and *[[Kock fields]]*, depending on whether one uses [[denial inequality]] or a separate [[tight apartness relation]] to characterize invertibility of elements. This split in the definition of field carries over to the definition of an ordered field. 

* An **ordered discrete field** is an [[ordered local ring]] such that $x$ is invertible or $x = 0$. 

* An **ordered Heyting field** is an [[ordered local ring]] such that $x$ is non-invertible if and only if $x = 0$. 

* An **[[ordered Kock field]]** is an [[ordered local ring]] such that $x$ is invertible if and only if $\neg (x = 0)$. 

Ordered Heyting fields are commonly used in [[real analysis]] with the [[Dedekind real numbers]], since the Dedekind real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and any [[subfield]] of $\mathbb{R}$ form an ordered Heyting field. On the other hand, ordered Kock fields are commonly used in [[synthetic differential geometry]]. 

Furthermore, a set having a strict total order no longer implies that the set has a weak total order, and a set having a weak total order no longer implies that the set has a strict total order. In particular, the traditional definition of an ordered field as defined above no longer implies that the ordered field is a [[lattice]], that it has binary [[joins]] and [[meets]]. 

Thus, some authors in constructive mathematics, such as [Booij 2020](#Booij20) and [Univalent Foundations Project 2013](#UFP13), have defined an ordered field to additionally have a lattice structure on $\leq$. However, it is consistent in constructive mathematics that there are ordered Heyting fields without a lattice structure (see [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/463680/archimedean-ordered-fields-without-maxima-and-minima-in-constructive-mathematics) for example), and ordered Kock fields which satisfy the [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] are not lattices with respect to $\leq$ either. 

## Examples

The field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]] is [[the]] [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]] ordered field.

The field $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]] is a [[subfield]] of $\mathbb{R}$ that is too small to be complete.

The field of [[surreal number]]s is a [[field extension]] of $\mathbb{R}$ that is too large to be complete.


## Properties

Every ordered field must have [[characteristic]] $0$, since we can prove by [[induction]] that $n \gt 0$ for every positive [[natural number]] $n$. 

As a result, the [[rational numbers]] are the [[initial]] ordered field, and every ordered field is a [[Q-algebra|$\mathbb{Q}$-algebra]]. 

The [[archimedean field|archimedean]] ordered fields are precisely the [[subfield]]s of [[real number|the field of real numbers]].

######Proposition 
Every Dedekind complete ordered field is archimedean. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
Suppose otherwise: let $a, b \gt 0$ be given, and suppose $b$ is an upper bound of $a, 2a, 3a, \ldots$. Then $b - a$ is an upper bound of $0, a, 2a, \ldots$ and consequently there can be no least upper bound of the sequence, contradicting Dedekind completeness.

The following is a result in classical mathematics. 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition 
A field admits an order ("is orderable") if and only if it is a **real field**, i.e., if the element $-1$ is not a sum of squares. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
Given an ordered field, any non-zero square is positive since either $-\alpha$ or $\alpha$ is positive, and so $(-\alpha)^2 = \alpha^2$ is positive. Hence a sum of non-zero squares cannot be negative, and in particular cannot be equal to $-1$. 

In the other direction, every real field $F$ may be embedded in a [[real closed field]] (this requires [[Zorn's lemma]]), and a real closed field admits a unique ordering. The restriction of this ordering to the embedded field $F$ gives an ordering on $F$.
