## Idea ##

This twenty page note aims at a clear and quick exposition of some   basic concepts and results in differential geometry, starting from the definition of vector fields, and culminating in Hodge theory on Kahler manifolds. Any success comes at the expense of omitting all proofs as well as   key tools like sheaf theory (except in passing remarks) and pull back functions and their functorial properties.    I have tried and believe to have   made the prerequisites   few   and the exposition  simple.
  Researching for this note  helped me  consolidate foggy recollections  of my decades-old studies, and 
I hope it will likewise prove useful to some readers in their learning introductory differential geometry.  The pace is leisurely in the beginning for the benefit of the novice, then picks up a bit in later sections. 

 
##   Vector fields and tensor fields on smooth manifolds  ## 

Throughout this section, let $M$ be a \textbf{smooth real manifold} of   dimension $n$. 
 
\newcommand{\A}{\mathcal{A}}


The set  
$$\A:=C^\infty(M)$$ 
of all real-valued smooth functions on $M$
is a  commutative ring under pointwise addition and multiplication of functions.
