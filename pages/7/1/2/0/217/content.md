The **Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets**, ETCS for short, is a formulation of set-theoretical [[foundations]] in a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] spirit. ETCS was proposes by [[Lawvere]], who publised a textbook about it

* F. William Lawvere, R. Rosebrugh, [_Sets for mathematics_](http://books.google.de/books?id=h3_7aZz9ZMoC&pg=PP1&dq=sets+for+mathematics)

An informative discussion of the pros and cons of Lawvere's aproach can be found in

#Todd Trimble's exposition of ETCS#

[[Todd Trimble]] has a series of expositional writings on ETCS which provide a very careful introduction and at the same time a whealth of useful details.
