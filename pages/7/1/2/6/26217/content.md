## Idea

Given a commutative ring $R$, a **paraunital $R$-algebra** is a [[nonunital algebra|nonunital $R$-algebra]] $A$ where there is an element $\iota \in A$ and an [[involution]] $x \mapsto \overline{x}$ such that $x \cdot \iota = \iota \cdot x = \overline{x}$ for all $x \in A$. A paraunital $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra is also called a **paraunital ring**. 

A [[unital algebra]] is a paraunital algebra in multiple different ways: 

* where the element is given by the unit $1$ and the involution is given by the [[identity function]] $x \mapsto x$. 

* where the element is given by the negation of the unit $-1$ and the involution is given by negation $x \mapsto -x$

These were first defined in the specific context of [[composition algebras]] in the [[generalized Hurwitz theorem]] in [Elduque 2021](#Elduque21) but could be generalized from composition algebras to any $R$-algebra.
