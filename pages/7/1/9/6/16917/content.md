  containing the now famous quote:

  > the  marriage   between mathematics and  physics, which was so enormously fruitful in past centuries, has recently ended in divorce.

  which is in reference to

  > The first clear sign of a breakdown in communication between physics and mathematics was the extraordinary lack of interest among mathematicians in [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s discovery  of the laws of [[electromagnetism]]
