## Idea

Neutral non-well-founded set theory is [[set theory]] without the [[axiom of foundation]], [[Mostowski's principle]], and the [[axiom of well-founded materialization]], but also without any axioms which contradict the axiom of foundation and Mostowski's principle, such as the [[axiom of anti-foundation]]. 

The axiom of choice is not in general accepted here because it implies [[Mostowski's principle]] for [[material set theories]] and the [[axiom of well-founded materialization]]. 

Important examples of neutral non-well-founded set theory include

* $ZF^{\circlearrowleft}$ and its structural counterpart [[SEAR]], 
* $IBZ^{\circlearrowleft}$ and its structural counterparts intuitionistic bounded SEAR and intuitionistic [[ETCS]].
