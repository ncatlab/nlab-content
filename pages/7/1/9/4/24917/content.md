## Idea

Neutral non-well-founded set theory is [[set theory]] without any of the [[axiom of foundation|foundation-like axioms]], including

* [[membership induction]] 
* the [[axiom of regularity]] 
* [[transitive closure]] 
* [[Mostowski's principle]]
*  the [[axiom of well-founded materialization]]

but also without any [[axioms]] which contradict the axioms above, such as the [[axiom of anti-foundation]], or any weaker versions of the above axioms. 

The [[axiom of choice]] is not in general accepted here because it implies the [[axiom of well-founded materialization]] in general, as well as [[Mostowski's principle]] for [[material set theories]]. 


Important examples of neutral non-well-founded set theory include

* $ZF^{\circlearrowleft}$ and its structural counterpart [[SEAR]], 
* $IBZ^{\circlearrowleft}$ and its structural counterparts intuitionistic bounded SEAR and intuitionistic [[ETCS]].
