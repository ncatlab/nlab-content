## Definition

A [[function]] $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is __injective__ if $x = y$ whenever $f(x) = f(y)$. Equivalently, a function is injective if all its [[fibers]] are [[subsingletons]]: for all elements $b \in B$ and for all elements $x \in A$ and $y \in A$, if $f(x) = b$ and $f(y) = b$, then $x = y$. An injective function is also called __one-to-one__ or an __injection__; it is the same as a [[monomorphism]] in [[Set|the category of sets]]. 

A _[[bijection]]_ is a function that is both injective and [[surjection|surjective]].

In [[constructive mathematics]], a [[strongly extensional function]] between sets equipped with tight [[apartness relation]]s is called __strongly injective__ if $f(x) \ne f(y)$ whenever $x \ne y$ (which implies that the function is injective).  This is the same as a [[regular monomorphism]] in the category of such sets and strongly extensional functions (while any merely injective function, if strongly extensional, is still a monomorphism).  Some authors use 'one-to-one' for an injective function as defined above and reserve 'injective' for the stronger notion.

## In other categories
Since an element $a$ in a set $A$ in the [[category of sets]] is just a [[global element]] $a:1\rightarrow A$, one could define injections in any category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$:

###### Definition
A morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is an __injection__ or a __one-to-one morphism__ if, given any two global elements $x, y:1\rightarrow A$, $x = y$ if $f \circ x = f \circ y$.

###### Remark 
The term __injective morphism__ is already used in category theory in a different context to mean a morphism with a [[right lifting property]].

###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$, every [[monomorphism]] is an injection.

This follows from the definition of a monomorphism.

###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$, every global element $e:1\rightarrow A$ is an injection.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
By definition of [[terminal object]] $1$, the unique global element $i:1\rightarrow 1$ is the identity morphism of the terminal object. Thus for every global element $e:1\rightarrow A$, for any two global elements $x, y:1\rightarrow 1$, $x = y$ is always true, making $e:1\rightarrow A$ an injection. 
=--

If the category has a [[strict initial object]] $\emptyset$, then every morphism $f:\emptyset\rightarrow B$ is vacuously an injection, since there are no global elements $x:1\rightarrow\emptyset$.
