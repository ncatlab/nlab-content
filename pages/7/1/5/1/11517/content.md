## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]], a _spectrum with $G$-action_ is a [[spectrum]] equipped with an [[action]] of $G$. In other words, it is a functor from $BG$ to the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of spectra. The [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra with $G$-action is part of the subject of [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. 

Spectra with $G$-action are sometimes called "doubly naive" $G$-spectra. They are even more naive than [[naive G-spectra]], and can be identified with the full subcategory of [[G-spectra]] consisting of "Borel-complete" $G$-spectra (see Prop. 6.17 in [MNN](#MNN) or Thm. II.2.7 in [NS](#NikolausScholze)).
