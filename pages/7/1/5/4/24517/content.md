## Idea

_System F_, also known as the _[[polymorphic]] [[lambda-calculus]]_ or _[[second-order logic|second-order]] [[lambda-calculus]]_, is an extension of [[simply typed lambda-calculus]] to include a [[type]] of [[impredicative]] [[universal quantification]].

## Semantics

Models of System F can be described as a form of [[hyperdoctrine]]:

1. A [[cartesian category]] K of *kinds*.
2. A [[functor]] $P \colon K^o \to CCC$, i.e., a [[contravariant functor]] from $K$ to the category of [[cartesian closed categories]] and [[functors]] preserving the CC structure.
3. A [[representable functor|representing object]] $U \in K$, i.e., $K(-,U) \cong P_0$ where $P_0 : K^o \to Set$ is the [[presheaf]] of objects of the corresponding CCC.
4. Such that for any $\Delta \in K$, the functor $P(\pi) \colon P(\Delta) \to P(\Delta \times U)$ induced from the [[projection]] $\pi \colon \Delta \times U \to \Delta$ has a [[right adjoint]] $\forall \colon P(\Delta \times U) \to P(\Delta)$ satisfying a [[Beck-Chevalley condition]].

Typically, the objects of the category of *kinds* are restricted to be generated by [[Cartesian product|products]] of $U$. 

Note that this models the $\beta\eta$ equivalence of System F only, not the more complex notion of [[relational parametricity]].
