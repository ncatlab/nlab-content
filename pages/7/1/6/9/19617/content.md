## Position

Lecturer at the [Department of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics](https://www.herts.ac.uk/study/schools-of-study/physics-engineering-and-computer-science/physics-astronomy-and-mathematics) at the [University of Hertfordshire](https://www.herts.ac.uk/) and researcher in Mathematical Physics.


## Research

My main research interest lies in the global geometric structures underlying the [[dualities]] of [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], to join the dots between [[double field theory]], [[gerbes]], [[generalized geometry]], [[non-geometry]] and [[T-folds]].
