PhD student in theoretical physics at the [Centre for Research in String Theory](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/strings/) at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), under the supervision of prof. [[David Berman]].

## Research

My main research interest lies in the global geometric structures underlying the [[dualities]] of [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], to join the dots between [[double field theory]], [[gerbes]], [[generalized geometry]], [[non-geometry]] and [[T-folds]].
