## Idea

*QWIRE* &lbrack;[Paykin, Rand & Zdancewic (2017)](#PaykinRandZdancewic17)&rbrack; is a [[quantum programming language]] for [[quantum circuit]] [[certified programming|certification]] based on [[linear type theory]] combined with [[intuitionistic type theory]] via the [[exponential modality]]. More specifically, it is a [[domain specific programming language]] for [[quantum circuits]] meant to be [[domain specific embedded programming language|embedded]] into an [[intuitionistic type theory]]. As such it is similar to *[[Quipper]]*.

  > emphasis on [[formal software verification]]:

  > &lbrack;p. iv:&rbrack; "We argue that [[quantum programs]] demand [[proof assistant|machine-checkable proofs]] of correctness. We justify this on the basis of the complexity of programs manipulating [[quantum states]], the expense of running [[quantum programs]], and the inapplicability of traditional debugging techniques to programs whose states cannot be examined."

  > &lbrack;p. 3:&rbrack; "Quantum programs are tremendously difficult to understand and implement, almost guaranteeing that they will have bugs. And traditional approaches to debugging will not help us: We cannot set breakpoints and look at our qubits without [[quantum state collapse|collapsing the quantum state]]. Even techniques like unit tests and random testing will be impossible to run on classical machines and too expensive to run on quantum computers – and failed tests are unlikely to be informative"

  > &lbrack;p. 4:&rbrack; "Thesis Statement: *[[quantum programming|Quantum programming]] is not only amenable to [[software verification|formal verification]]: it demands it.*"

  > The overarching goal of this thesis is to write and verify quantum programs together. Towards that end, we introduce a quantum programming language called [[Qwire]] and embed it inside the [[Coq]] [[proof assistant]]. We give it a [[linear type system]] to ensure that it obeys the laws of [[quantum mechanics]] and a [[denotational semantics]] to prove that programs behave as desired.
