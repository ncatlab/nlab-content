## Statement

For a nonsingular [[algebraic variety]] $X$ over the [[complex numbers]], the [[functor]] $Y \mapsto Y^{an}$ which sends complex  [[algebraic varieties]] to their [[complex analytic topology]] establishes an [[equivalence of categories]] between the corresponding [[étale sites]] $X_{et} \simeq X^{an}_{et}$.
