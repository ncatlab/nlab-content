## Idea

Ordinary [[heterotic string theory]] is the study of the [[string scattering amplitude|string perturbation series]] of [[correlators]] of a certain [[2d SCFT|2-dimensional]] [[SCFT]] over [[super Riemann surfaces]]. The resulting [[S-matrix]] is interpreted as encoding the [[string scattering amplitude|scattering amplitudes of strings]] propagating in some [[target space]].

Among the [[gauge fields]] that these strings are charged under is the [[Kalb-Ramond field]], which is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]].

By general [[electric-magnetic duality]] (see [Freed 00](#Freed00) for a formal treatment in [[differential cohomology]]) one expects there to be a dual theory theory where the $(p=1)$-dimensional strings are replaced by their magnetic duals, which are $10-(p+2)-2 = 5$-branes. 

The study of the corresponding perturbation series over correlators of the 6-dimensional fivebrane worldvolume [[SCFT]] over 6-volumes is far from tractable,  but a handful of consistency checks exist, that the corresponding _dual heterotic string theory_ makes sense.

Where the [[quantum anomaly]]-cancellation for the heterotic string involves the demand for (twisted) [[string structure]]s, that for the dual theory involves [[fivebrane structure]]s (which gives these their name).

The dual degree-8 anomaly polynomial in [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] for dual heterotic string theory is (e.g. [Freed 00 (3.48)](#Freed00))

$$
  d H_7
  \;=\;
  ch_4(A)
  -
  \tfrac{1}{48}
  p_1(\omega) \wedge ch_2(A)
  + 
  \tfrac{1}{64}
  p_1(\omega) \wedge p_1(\omega)
  -
  \tfrac{1}{48} p_2(\omega)
  \,,
$$

where $A$ denotes the [[gauge field]] [[connection on a bundle|connection]], $\omega$ the [[gravity]] [[spin connection]], $ch_n$ the degree-$n$ component of the [[Chern character]] and $p;_i$ the [[Pontryagin classes]].

On p. 3 and 4 the latter reviews the worldsheet description of the relevant terms for the string and then look at the corresponding situation for the 5-brane on p. 6.

So this is the EM-dual analog of the Killingback-Witten-computation of the fermionic  anomaly that leads to [[string structure]]s in the heterotic string (see there). Where the former involves cancelling the first fractional [[Pontryagin class]], this involves the second.
