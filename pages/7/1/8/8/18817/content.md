 {#Geometry}

The [[geometry of physics]] is _[[differential geometry]]_. This is the flavor of [[geometry]] which is modeled on
[[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with [[smooth functions]] between them. Here we briefly review the basics of
[[differential geometry]] on [[Cartesian spaces]].

In principle the only **background** assumed of the reader here is

1. usual _[[structural set theory|naive set theory]]_ (e.g. [[Sets for Mathematics|Lawvere-Rosebrugh 03]]);

1. the concept of the _[[continuum]]_: the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, the [[plane]] $\mathbb{R}^2$, etc.

1. the concepts of _[[differentiation]]_ and _[[integration]]_ of functions on such [[Cartesian spaces]];

hence essentially the content of multi-variable [[differential calculus]].

We now discuss:

* _[Abstract coordinate systems](#SmoothFunctions)_

* _[Fiber bundles](#BundlesAndSections)_

* _[Synthetic differential geometry](#SyntheticDifferentialGeometry)_

* _[Differential forms](#DifferentialFormsAndCartanCalculus)_


As we uncover [[Lagrangian field theory]] further below, we discover ever more general concepts of
"[[space]]" in differential geometry, such as
_[[smooth manifolds]]_, _[[diffeological spaces]]_, _[[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]]_, _[[supermanifolds]]_, _[[Lie algebroids]]_
and _[[super L-∞ algebra|super]] [[Lie ∞-algebroids]]_.
We introduce these incrementally as we go along:

**Abstract coordinate systems**
 {#SmoothFunctions}

What characterizes [[differential geometry]] is that it models [[geometry]] on _the [[continuum]]_,
namely the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, together with its [[Cartesian products]] $\mathbb{R}^n$,
regarded with its canonical [[smooth structure]] (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem} below).
We may think of these _[[Cartesian spaces]]_ $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the "abstract [[coordinate systems]]"
and of the [[smooth functions]] between them as the "abstract [[coordinate transformations]]".

We will eventually consider [below](#FieldBundles) much more general "[[smooth spaces]]" $X$ than just the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$;
but all of them are going to be understood by "laying out abstract coordinate systems" inside them,
in the general sense of having smooth functions $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X$ mapping a Cartesian space smoothly into them.
All structure on [[generalized smooth spaces]] $X$ is thereby reduced to _compatible systems_ of structures on just [[Cartesian spaces]],
one for each smooth "probe" $f\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X$. This is called "[[functorial geometry]]".

Notice that the popular concept of a _[[smooth manifold]]_ (def./prop. \ref{SmoothManifoldInsideDiffeologicalSpaces} below)
is essentially that o a [[smooth space]] which _locally looks just like_ a [[Cartesian space]],
in that there exist sufficiently many $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X$ which are ([[open map|open]]) _[[isomorphisms]]_
onto their [[images]]. Historically it was a long process to arrive at the insight that it is wrong to _fix_
such local coordinate identifications $f$, or to have any structure depend on such a choice. But it is useful
to go one step further:

In [[functorial geometry]] we do not even focus attention on those $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X$ that are
isomorphisms onto their image, but consider _all_ "probes" of $X$ by "abstract coordinate systems".
This makes [[differential geometry]] both simpler as well as more powerful. The analogous insight
for [[algebraic geometry]] is due to [Grothendieck 65](functorial+geometry#Grothendieck65); it was transported
to [[differential geometry]] by [Lawvere 67](synthetic+differential+geometry#Lawvere67).

This allows to combine the best of two superficially disjoint worlds: On the one hand we may reduce
all constructions and computations to [[coordinates]], the way traditionally done in the [[physics]] literature;
on the other hand we have full conceptial control over the coordinate-free generalized spaces analyzed thereby.
What makes this work is that all [[coordinate]]-constructions are _[[functorial geometry|functorially]]_ considered
over all abstract coordinate systems.

###### Definition
**([[Cartesian spaces]] and [[smooth functions]] between them)**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we say that the set $\mathbb{R}^n$ of [[n-tuples]] of [[real numbers]]
is a _[[Cartesian space]]_. This comes with the canonical [[coordinate functions]]

$$
  x^k \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

which send an [[n-tuple]] of real numbers to the $k$th element in the tuple, for $k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}$.

For

$$
  f \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n'}
$$

any [[function]] between [[Cartesian spaces]], we may ask whether its [[partial derivative]]
along the $k$th coordinate exists, denoted

$$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^k}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{R}^{n}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^{n'}
  \,.
$$

If this exists, we may in turn ask that the [[partial derivative]] of the partial derivative exists

$$
  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^{k_1} \partial x^{k_2}}
  \coloneqq
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{k_2}} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{k_1}}
$$

and so on.

A general higher [[partial derivative]] obtained this way is, if it exists, indexed by an [[n-tuple]]
of [[natural numbers]] $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n$ and denoted

$$
  \label{PartialDerivativeWithManyIndices}
  \partial_\alpha
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{
    \partial^{\vert \alpha \vert} f
  }{
    \partial^{\alpha_1} x^1
    \partial^{\alpha_2} x^2
      \cdots
    \partial^{\alpha_n} x^n
  }
  \,,
$$

where ${\vert \alpha\vert} \coloneqq \underoverset{n}{i = 1}{\sum} \alpha_i$ is the total _order_ of the partial derivative.

If all partial derivative to all orders $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n$ of a [[function]] $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n'}$
exist, then $f$ is called a _[[smooth function]]_.

=--

Of course the [[composition]] $g \circ f$ of two smooth functions is again a [[smooth function]].

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^{n_1}
      && \underset{g \circ f}{\longrightarrow} &&
    \mathbb{R}^{n_3}
  }
  \,.
$$


The inclined reader may notice that this means that [[Cartesian spaces]] with [[smooth functions]]
between them constitute a _[[category]]_ ("[[CartSp]]"); but the reader not so inclined may ignore this.

For the following it is useful to think of each [[Cartesian space]] as an _abstract [[coordinate system]]_.
We will be dealing with various [[generalized smooth spaces]] (see the table [below](#NotionsOfGeometry)), but they will all be characterized by
a prescription for how to smoothly map abstract coordinate systems into them.

**[[fiber bundles]]**
 {#BundlesAndSections}

Given any context of [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] between them, such as the [[Cartesian spaces]]
and [[smooth functions]] from def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}
it is of interest to fix one [[object]] $X$ and consider other objects _[[dependent type|parameterized over]]_
it. These are called _[[bundles]]_ (def. \ref{BundlesAndFibers}) below.
For reference, we briefly discuss here the basic concepts related to [[bundles]] in the context of
[[Cartesian spaces]].

Of course the theory of bundles is mostly trivial over Cartesian spaces;
it gains its main interest from its generalization to more general [[smooth manifolds]] (def./prop. \ref{SmoothManifoldInsideDiffeologicalSpaces} below).
It is still worthwhile for our development to first consider the relevant concepts in this simple case first.

For more exposition see at _[[fiber bundles in physics]]_.

$\,$

+-- {: .num_defn #BundlesAndFibers}
###### Definition
**([[bundles]])**

We say that a [[smooth function]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} X$ (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem})
is a _[[bundle]]_ just to amplify that we think of it as exhibiting $E$ as being a "space over $X$":

$$
  \array{
    E
    \\
    \downarrow\mathrlap{fb}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

For $x \in X$ a point, we say that the _[[fiber]]_ of this [[bundle]] over $x$ is the [[pre-image]]

$$
  \label{FiberOfAFiberBundle}
  E_x \coloneqq fb^{-1}(\{x\}) \subset E
$$

of the point $x$ under the smooth function. We think of $fb$ as exhibiting a "smoothly varying" set of [[fiber]] spaces over $X$.

Given two [[bundles]] $E_1 \overset{fb_1}{\to} X$ and $E_2 \overset{fb_2}{\to} X$ over $X$,
a _[[homomorphism]] of bundles_ between them is a [[smooth function]]
$f \colon E_1 \to E_2$ (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}) between their
total spaces which respects the bundle projections, in that

$$
  fb_2  \circ f = fb_1
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \text{i.e.}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \array{
    E_1 && \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} && E_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{fb_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{fb_2}}
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence a bundle homomorphism is a smooth function that sends [[fibers]] to [[fibers]] over the same point:

$$
  f\left(
    (E_1)_x
  \right)
    \;\subset\;
  (E_2)_x
  \,.
$$

The inclined reader may notice that this defines a [[category]] of [[bundles]] over $X$,
which is in fact just the _[[slice category]]_ $CartSp_{/X}$; the reader not so inclined may ignore this.

Given a [[bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} X$ (def. \ref{BundlesAndFibers})

$$

is called the _[[tangent bundle]]_ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. With $(x^a)_{a = 1}^n$ the [[coordinate functions]]
on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{CoordinateFunctionsAreSmoothFunctions}) we write $(\partial_a)_{a = 1}^n$
for the corresponding [[linear basis]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$ regarded as a [[vector space]]. Then
a general [[section]] (def. \ref{Sections})

$$
  \array{
    && T \mathbb{R}^n

$$
  v = v^a \partial_a
$$

where a sum over indices is understood ([[Einstein summation convention]]) and where
the components $(v^a \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n))_{a = 1}^n$
are [[smooth functions]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}).

Such a $v$ is also called a smooth _[[tangent vector field]]_ on $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Each tangent vector field $v$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ determines a [[partial derivative]]
on [[smooth functions]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) &\overset{D_v}{\longrightarrow}& C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \\
    f &\mapsto& \mathrlap{ D_v f \coloneqq v^a \partial_a (f) \coloneqq  \sum_a v^a \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^a} }
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[product law]] of [[differentiation]], this is a [[derivation]] on the [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]]
(example \ref{AlgebraOfSmoothFunctionsOnCartesianSpaces}) in that

1. it is an $\mathbb{R}$-[[linear map]] in that

   $$
     D_v( c_1 f_1 + c_2 f_2 ) = c_1 D_v f_1 + c_2 D_v f_2
   $$

1. it satisfies the [[Leibniz rule]]

   $$
     D_v(f_1 \cdot f_2) = (D_v f_1) \cdot f_2 + f_1 \cdot (D_v f_2)
   $$

for all $c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ and all $f_1, f_2 \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

Hence regarding [[tangent vector fields]] as [[partial derivatives]] constitutes a [[linear function]]

$$
  D \;\colon\; \Gamma_{\mathbb{R}^n}(T \mathbb{R}^n) \longrightarrow Der(C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n))
$$

from the [[space of sections]] of the [[tangent bundle]]. In fact this is
a [[homomorphism]] of $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$-[[modules]] (example \ref{ModuleOfSectionsOfAVectorBundle}),
in that for $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $v \in \Gamma_{\mathbb{R}^n}(T \mathbb{R}^n)$ we have

Below we encounter generalizations of ordinary [[differential geometry]] that include
explicit "[[infinitesimals]]" in the guise of _[[infinitesimally thickened points]]_,
as well as "super-graded infinitesimals", in the guise of _[[superpoints]]_ (necessary for the
description of [[fermion fields]] such as the [[Dirac field]]). As we discuss [below](#FieldBundles), these structures are
naturally incorporated into [[differential geometry]] in just the same way as [[Grothendieck]]
introduced them into [[algebraic geometry]] (in the guise of "[[formal schemes]]"),
namely in terms of [[formal dual|formally dual]] [[rings of functions]] with [[nilpotent ideals]].
That this also works well for [[differential geometry]] rests on the following three
basic but important properties, which say that [[smooth functions]] behave "more algebraically"
than their definition might superficially suggest:

Actually all three statements in prop. \ref{AlgebraicFactsOfDifferentialGeometry}
hold not just for [[Cartesian spaces]], but generally for [[smooth manifolds]] (def./prop. \ref{SmoothManifoldInsideDiffeologicalSpaces} below; if only we generalize in the second statement from [[free modules]] to [[projective modules]].
However for our development here it is useful to first focus on just [[Cartesian spaces]] and then bootstrap
the theory of [[smooth  manifolds]] and much more from that, which we do [below](#FieldBundles).

**[[differential forms]]**
 {#DifferentialFormsAndCartanCalculus}

We introduce and discuss [[differential forms]] on [[Cartesian spaces]].

+-- {: .num_defn #Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}
###### Definition
**([[differential 1-forms]] on [[Cartesian spaces]] and the [[cotangent bundle]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a _[[smooth differential 1-form]]_ $\omega$ on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}) is an [[n-tuple]]

$$
  \left(\omega_i \in CartSp\left(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}\right)\right)_{i = 1}^n
$$

of [[smooth functions]] (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}), which we think of equivalently as the [[coefficients]] of a [[formal linear combination]]

$$
  \omega = \omega_i d x^i
$$

on a [[set]] $\{d x^1, d x^2, \cdots, d x^n\}$ of [[cardinality]] $n$.

Here a sum over repeated indices is tacitly understood ([[Einstein summation convention]]).

Write

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k) \simeq CartSp(\mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R})^{\times k}\in Set
$$

for the set of smooth [[differential 1-forms]] on $\mathbb{R}^k$.

We may think of the expressions $(d x^a)_{a = 1}^n$ as a [[linear basis]] for the [[dual vector space]]
$\mathbb{R}^n$. With this the [[differential 1-forms]] are equivalently the [[sections]] (def. \ref{Sections})
of the [[trivial vector bundle]] (example \ref{TrivialBundleOnCartesianSpace}, def. \ref{VectorBundle})

$$
  \array{
    T^\ast \mathbb{R}^n &\coloneqq& \mathbb{R}^n \times (\mathbb{R}^n)^\ast
    \\
    \mathllap{cb}\downarrow && \downarrow\mathrlap{pr_1}
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^n &=& \mathbb{R}^n
  }
$$

called the _[[cotangent bundle]]_ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}):

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n) = \Gamma_{\mathbb{R}^n}(T^\ast \mathbb{R}^n)
  \,.
$$

This amplifies via example \ref{ModuleOfSectionsOfAVectorBundle} that $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$
has the  [[structure]] of a [[module]] over the [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]] $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$,
by the evident multiplication of [[differential 1-forms]] with [[smooth functions]]:

1. The set $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k)$ of [[differential 1-forms]] in a [[Cartesian space]] (def. \ref{Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces})
   is naturally an [[abelian group]] with addition given by componentwise addition

   $$
      \begin{aligned}
         \omega + \lambda & =
          \omega_i d x^i + \lambda_i d x^i
         \\
         & = (\omega_i + \lambda_i) d x^i
      \end{aligned}
      \,,
   $$

1. The abelian group $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k)$ is naturally equipped with the structure of a [[module]] over the
   [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]] $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k)$ (example \ref{AlgebraOfSmoothFunctionsOnCartesianSpaces}), where the [[action]] $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) \times\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k) \to \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k)$ is given by componentwise multiplication

   $$
     f \cdot \omega = ( f \cdot \omega_i) d x^i
     \,.
   $$


Accordingly there is a canonical pairing between [[differential 1-forms]] and [[tangent vector fields]] (example \ref{TangentVectorFields})

$$
  \label{PairingVectorFieldsWithDifferential1Forms}
  \array{
    \Gamma_{\mathbb{R}^n}(T \mathbb{R}^n)
    \otimes_{\mathbb{R}}
    \Gamma_{\mathbb{R}^n}(T \ast \mathbb{R}^n)
      &\overset{\iota_{(-)}(-) }{\longrightarrow}&
    C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \\
    (v,\omega)
    &\mapsto&
    \mathrlap{
      \iota_v \omega \coloneqq v^a \omega_a
    }
  }
$$

With [[differential 1-forms]] in hand, we may collect all the first-order [[partial derivatives]] of a [[smooth function]]
into a single object: the _[[exterior derivative]]_ or _[[de Rham differential]]_ is the $\mathbb{R}$-[[linear function]]

$$
  \label{deRhamDifferentialOnFunctionsOnCartesianSpace}
  \array{
    C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) &\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}& \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \\
    f &\mapsto& \mathrlap{ d f \coloneqq \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x^a} d x^a }
  }
  \,.
$$

Under the above pairing with [[tangent vector fields]] $v$ this yields the particular [[partial derivative]] along $v$:

$$
  \iota_v d f = D_v f = v^a \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^a}
  \,.
$$

=--


We think of $d  x^i$ as a measure for [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] displacements along the $x^i$-[[coordinate]] of a [[Cartesian space]]. If we have a measure of infintesimal displacement on some $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a smooth function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^{\tilde n} \to \mathbb{R}^n$, then this induces a measure for infinitesimal displacement on $\mathbb{R}^{\tilde n}$ by sending whatever happens there first with  $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ and then applying the given measure there. This is captured by the following definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #PullbackOfDifferential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}
###### Definition
**([[pullback of differential forms|pullback of differential 1-forms]])**

For $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^{\tilde k} \to \mathbb{R}^k$ a [[smooth function]], the **[[pullback of differential forms|pullback of differential 1-forms]]** along $\phi$ is the [[function]]

$$
  \phi^* \colon \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{k}) \to \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{\tilde k})
$$

between sets of differential 1-forms, def. \ref{Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}, which is defined on [[basis]]-elements by

$$
  \phi^* d  x^i
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \tilde x^j} d \tilde x^j
$$

and then extended linearly by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi^* \omega & = \phi^* \left(  \omega_i d x^i \right)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
      \left(\phi^* \omega\right)_i  \frac{\partial \phi^i }{\partial \tilde x^j}  d  \tilde x^j
    \\
    & =
     (\omega_i \circ \phi) \cdot \frac{\partial \phi^i }{\partial \tilde x^j}  d  \tilde x^j
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This is compatible with [[identity morphisms]] and [[composition]] in that

$$
  \label{PullbackOfDifferentialFormsCompatibleWithComposition}
  (id_{\mathbb{R}^n})^\ast = id_{\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)}
  \phantom{AAAA}
  (g \circ f)^\ast = f^\ast \circ g^\ast
  \,.
$$

Stated more [[category theory|abstractly]], this just means that [[pullback of differential forms|pullback of differential 1-forms]]
makes the assignment of sets of differential 1-forms to [[Cartesian spaces]] a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[functor]]

$$
  \Omega^1(-) \;\colon\; CartSp^{op} \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$


=--


The following definition captures the idea that if $d  x^i$ is a measure for displacement along the $x^i$-[[coordinate]], and $d x^j$ a measure for displacement along the $x^j$ coordinate, then there should be a way to get a measure, to be called $d x^i \wedge d  x^j$, for [[infinitesimal]] _[[surfaces]]_ (squares) in the $x^i$-$x^j$-plane. And this should keep track of the [[orientation]] of these squares, with

$$
  d x^j \wedge d x^i = - d x^i \wedge d  x^j
$$

being the same infinitesimal measure with orientation reversed.

+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentialnForms}

**([[exterior algebra]] of [[differential n-forms]])**

For $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **smooth [[differential forms]]** on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^k$ (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}) is the [[exterior algebra]]

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^k)
   \coloneqq
  \wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k)} \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k)

over the [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]] $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k)$ (example \ref{AlgebraOfSmoothFunctionsOnCartesianSpaces}) of the [[module]] $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k)$ of smooth 1-forms.

We write $\Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k)$ for the sub-module of degree $n$ and call its elements the _[[differential n-forms]]_.

Explicitly this means that a [[differential n-form]] $\omega \in \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k)$ on $\mathbb{R}^k$ is a [[formal linear combination]] over $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k)$ (example \ref{AlgebraOfSmoothFunctionsOnCartesianSpaces}) of [[basis]] elements of the form $d  x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{i_n}$ for $i_1 \lt i_2 \lt \cdots \lt i_n$:

the [[de Rham differential]] $d \colon C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$
(eq:deRhamDifferentialOnFunctionsOnCartesianSpace) uniquely extended as a [[derivation]]
of degree +1 to the [[exterior algebra]] of [[differential forms]] (def. \ref{DifferentialnForms})

$$
  d
    \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

meaning that for $\omega_i \in \Omega^{k_i}(\mathbb{R})$ then

$$
  d(\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2)
  \;=\;
  (d \omega_1) \wedge \omega_2
  +
  \omega_1 \wedge d \omega_2
  \,.
$$

In components this simply means that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d \omega
    & =
    d \left(\omega_{i_1 \cdots i_k} d x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{i_k}\right)

    d x^a \wedge d x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{i_k}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since [[partial derivatives]] commute with each other, while differential 1-form anti-commute, this implies
that $d$ is nilpotent

$$
  d^2 = d \circ d = 0
  \,.
$$

We say hence that [[differential forms]] form a _[[cochain complex]]_, the _[[de Rham complex]]_
$(\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^n), d)$.

hence that [[pullback of differential forms]] is a _[[chain map]]_ of [[de Rham complexes]].

This is still compatible with [[identity morphisms]] and [[composition]] in that

$$
  \label{PullbackOfDiffereentialFormsCompatibleWithComposition}
  (id_{\mathbb{R}^n})^\ast = id_{\Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)}

  (g \circ f)^\ast = f^\ast \circ g^\ast

$$

Stated more [[category theory|abstractly]], this just means that [[pullback of differential forms|pullback of differential n-forms]]
makes the assignment of sets of [[differential n-forms]] to [[Cartesian spaces]] a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[functor]]

###### Proposition
**([[Cartan's homotopy formula]])**

Let $X$ be a [[Cartesian space]] (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}), and let $v \in \Gamma(T X)$ be
a smooth [[tangent vector field]] (example \ref{TangentVectorFields}).

For $t \in \mathbb{R}$ write $\exp(t v) \colon X \overset{\simeq}{\to} X$ for the [[flow]] by [[diffeomorphisms]]
along $v$ of parameter length $t$.

Then the [[derivative]] with respect to $t$ of the [[pullback of differential forms]] along $\exp(t v)$, hence the [[Lie derivative]]
$\mathcal{L}_v \colon \Omega^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)$,
 is given by the [[anticommutator]] of the contraction derivation $\iota_v$ (def. \ref{ContractionOfFormsWithVectorFields}) with the [[de Rham differential]] $d$ (def. \ref{deRhamDifferential}):

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L}_v
      &\coloneqq
    \frac{d}{d t } \exp(t v)^\ast \omega \vert_{t = 0}
    \\
    & =
    \iota_v d \omega + d \iota_v \omega
    \,.
  \end{aligned}

Finally we turn to the concept of [[integration of differential forms]] (def. \ref{IntegrationOfDifferentialFormsOverSmoothSingularChainsInCartesianSpaces} below).
First we need to say what it is that differential forms may be integrated over:

###### Definition
**(smooth [[singular simplicial chains]] in [[Cartesian spaces]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the _standard [[n-simplex]]_ in the [[Cartesian space]]
$\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem}) is the
[[subset]]

$$
  \Delta^n
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    (x^i)_{i = 1}^n
    \;\vert\;
    0 \leq x^1 \leq \cdots \leq x^n
  \right\}
  \;\subset\;
  \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

More generally, a _smooth [[singular simplicial complex|singular n-simplex]]_ in a [[Cartesian space]]
$\mathbb{R}^k$ is a [[smooth function]] (def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctionsBetweenThem})

$$
  \sigma
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{R}^n
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^k
  \,,
$$

to be thought of as a smooth extension of its restriction

$$
  \sigma\vert_{\Delta^n}
    \;\colon\;
  \Delta^n
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^k
  \,.
$$

(This is called a _[[singular simplicial complex|singular]]_ simplex because there is no condition that
$\Sigma$ be an [[embedding]] in any way, in particular $\sigma$ may be a [[constant function]].)

A [[singular chain]] in $\mathbb{R}^k$ of [[dimension]] $n$ is a [[formal linear combination]] of singular $n$-simplices in $\mathbb{R}^k$.

In particular, given a singular $n+1$-simplex $\sigma$, then its _[[boundary of a simplex|boundary]]_
is a [[singular chain]] of singular $n$-simplices $\partial \sigma$.

###### Definition
**([[fiber integration|fiber]]-[[integration of differential forms]]) over smooth [[singular chains]] in [[Cartesian spaces]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\omega \in \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^n)$ a [[differential n-form]] (def. \ref{DifferentialnForms}),
which may be written as

$$
  \omega = f d x^1 \wedge \cdots d x^n
  \,,
$$

then its [[integration of differential forms|integration]] over the standard [[n-simplex]] $\Delta^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{SingularSimplicesInCartesianSpaces}) is the ordinary [[integral]] (e.g. [[Riemann integral]])

$$
  \int_{\Delta^n} \omega
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{0 \leq x^1 \leq \cdots \leq x^n \leq 1}{\int} f(x^1, \cdots, x^n) \, d x^1 \cdots d x^n
  \,.
$$

More generally, for

1. $\omega \in \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k)$ a [[differential n-forms]];

1. $C = \underset{i}{\sum} c_i \sigma_i $ a singular $n$-chain (def. \ref{SingularSimplicesInCartesianSpaces})

in any [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^k$. Then the _[[integration of differential forms|integration]]_
of $\omega$ over $x$ is the [[sum]] of the integrations, as above, of the [[pullback of differential forms]] (def. \ref{PullbackOfDifferentialForms}) along all the singular [[n-simplices]] in the chain:

$$
  \int_C \omega
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{i}{\sum}
  c_i
  \int_{\Delta^n} (\sigma_i)^\ast \omega
  \,.
$$

Finally, for $U$ another Cartesian space, then _[[fiber integration]] of differential forms along $U \times C \to U$_
is the linear map

$$
  \int_C \;\colon\; \Omega^{\bullet + dim(C)}(U \times C) \longrightarrow \Omega^\bullet(U)
$$

which on differential forms of the form $\omega_U \wedge \omega$ is given by

$$
  \int_C \omega_U \wedge \omega
   \;\coloneqq\;
  (-1)^{\vert \omega_U\vert} \int_C \omega

###### Proposition
**([[Stokes theorem]] for [[fiber integration|fiber]]-[[integration of differential forms]])**

For $\Sigma$ a smooth [[singular simplicial chain]] (def. \ref{IntegrationOfDifferentialFormsOverSmoothSingularChainsInCartesianSpaces})
the operation of [[fiber integration|fiber]]-[[integration of differential forms]] along
$U \times \Sigma \overset{pr_1}{\longrightarrow} U$ (def. \ref{IntegrationOfDifferentialFormsOverSmoothSingularChainsInCartesianSpaces})
is compatible with the [[exterior derivative]] $d_U$ on $U$ (def. \ref{deRhamDifferential}) in that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d \int_\Sigma \omega
     & =
    (-1)^{dim(\Sigma)} \int_\Sigma d_U \omega
    \\
    & =
    (-1)^{dim(\Sigma)}

      \int_\Sigma d \omega
      -
      \int_{\partial \Sigma} \omega
    \right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where $d = d_U + d_\Sigma$ is the [[de Rham differential]] on $U \times \Sigma$ (def. \ref{deRhamDifferential}) and where the second
equality is the _[[Stokes theorem]]_ along $\Sigma$:

$$
  \int_\Sigma d_\Sigma \omega = \int_{\partial \Sigma} \omega
