## Idea

### Double line notation

What is called _’t Hooft double line notation_ (following [’t Hooft 74](#tHooft74)) is the observation that for the [[fundamental representations]] $V$ of [[semisimple Lie algebras]] $\mathfrak{g}$. the [[Lie algebra weight system|Lie algebra weight]] of a $\mathfrak{g}$-[[Yang-Mills theory]] [[Feynman diagram]] with internal/[[virtual particle|virtual]] [[gluon]] lines is equivalent to one without any [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[gluon]]-lines, obtained by:

{#JacobiIdentity} 1) using the [[Jacobi identity]] to replace all internal gluon vertices by ([[linear combinations]] of) quark-gluon vertices

</center>


{#MetricContractionOfFundamentalLieAction} 2)  replacing any remaining internal gluon line together with the [[quark]] [[interaction]] [[vertices]] at its ends (equivalently: an [[M2-brane 3-algebra]] [[tensor]])
by (a [[linear combination]] of) _double_ [[quark]]-lines, according to the following rules:

{#Example} For example, for $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{so}(N)$ a [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]], the ’t Hooft double line notation of a single trivalent vertex inside a single Wilson loop is the following:

Here we are using the [[string diagram]]/[[Penrose notation]] from _[[metric Lie representations]]_.

{#Attribution} **Attribution.** In [’t Hooft 74](#tHooft74) this is observed for the [[unitary Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{u}(N)$, in which case only the first summand of the expressions [above](#MetricContractionOfFundamentalLieAction) appears. The generalization to arbitrary [[semisimple Lie algebras]] is observed in [Cvitanović 76, Fig. 14](#Cvitanovic76), reviewed for [[special unitary Lie algebra|su(N)]], [[special orthogonal Lie algebra|so(N)]] and [[symplectic Lie algebra|sp(N)]] in [Cvitanović 08 (9.57), (10.13) and (12.9)](#Cvitanovic08) and for [[special orthogonal Lie algebra|so(N)]] in [Chmutov-Duzhin-Mostovoy 11, 6.2.6](#ChmutovDuzhinMostovoy11).
For the case $\mathfrak{so}(N)$ see also 
[Bar-Natan 95, Section 6.3](#BarNatan95) (with an eye towards [[Vassiliev knot invariants]]) and
[Cicuta 82](#Cicuta82), [Ita-Nieder-Oz 02, Figure 3](#ItaNiederOz02), [McGreevy-Swingle 08, Figure 10](#McGreevySwingle08) (with more discussion of the [[large N limit]]). The case of [[general linear Lie algebra|gl(N)]] is considered in [Bar-Natan 96, Section 2.2](#BarNatan96), [Chmutov-Duzhin-Mostovoy 11, 6.2.5](#ChmutovDuzhinMostovoy11), and the case [[special linear Lie algebra|sl(N)]] in [Chmutov-Duzhin-Mostovoy 11, 6.2.3](#ChmutovDuzhinMostovoy11), [Jackson-Moffat 19, Section 14.4](#JacksonMoffat19).

### Surface notation

Furthermore, one may regard the resulting double-line diagrams as a [[ribbon graph]] thickening of the original [[Feynman diagrams]], and  thus as [[surfaces]] [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]] and with markings on the [[boundary]].

In the case $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{so}(N)$ this means that a single [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[gluon]] line is represented by the [[formal linear combination]] of a strip (marked [[disk]]) and a twisted strip:

<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/tHooftDoubleLineToSurfaces.jpg" width="600">
</center>

Using this on the reduction of internal gluon vertices by the [[Jacobi identity]] as [above](#JacobiIdentity) one finds that a single [[gluon]] vertex turns into the following linear combination of marked surfaces:

<center>

</center>

> graphics from [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|Sati-Schreiber 19c]]


This gives [[open string]] [[worldsheets]]. Regarding them as such in the case of [[Chern-Simons theory]] exhibits [[Chern-Simons theory as an open topological string theory]] ([Witten 92, see Figures 1 & 2](#Witten92)) even before passing to the [[large N limit]].

For [[AdS/CFT duality]] relating [[super Yang-Mills theory]] to _[[closed strings|closed]]_ [[string theory]] and open to _closed_ [[topological string theory]] ([Gopakumar-Vafa 98](#GopakumarVafa98)) there is an operation of gluing in [[faces]] to turn these [[open strings]] into [[closed string]] [[worldsheets]], see
[Gaiotto-Rastelli 03, Section 1.1](#GaiottoRastelli03)
and see [Marino 04, Section III, p. 14](#Marino04) for a clear statement).

Here [[open/closed string duality]] plays a subtle role in interpreting the [['t Hooft double line notation]] of [[gauge theory]] [[Feynman diagrams]] in the [[large N limit]] alternatively as [[open string]] or as [[closed string]] [[worldsheets]], see also [Gopakumar 04](#Gopakumar04).

### As a surface-valued weight system

After averaging over the $n!$ permutations of the ordering of the $n$ external vertices (those on the Wilson line) of a Jacobi diagram, this construction respects the [[STU relation]] on [[Jacobi diagrams]] and hence gives a [[weight system]] with values in marked surfaces ([Bar-Natan 95, Theorem 10 with Theorem 8](#BarNatan95)):

This means that [[stringy weight systems]] pull back to ordinary [[weight systems]] along this map, corresponding to taking their [[worldline formalism|point-particle limit]]. Under this map [[stringy weight systems span classical Lie algebra weight systems]].

\linebreak

Of course, the ’t Hooft double line construction applies not just to [[Jacobi diagrams]] but also to [[Sullivan chord diagrams]]:

## Applications

### Large $N$ Limit and holography

One upshot of this double-line reformulation is that it makes the dependence of the [[Feynman amplitude]] on the [[natural number]] $N$ fully explicit, since a double line diagram simply contributes one factor of $N$ for each closed [[quark]] line (this being the [[trace]] over the [[fundamental representation]]).

In fact, by regarding the resulting double-line diagrams as a [[ribbon graph]] thickenings the original [[Feynman diagrams]], and regarding these [[ribbon graphs]] in turn as [[surfaces]], the $N$-dependence is proportional to the [[genus of a surface|genus]] of these surfaces.


One finds this way that in the _[[large N limit]]_, i.e. the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] where $N \to \infty$, precisely only the [[planar graphs]] contribute to the [[Yang-Mills theory]] [[Feynman amplitudes]], corresponding to  [[surfaces]] of [[genus]] 0 (i.e. [[tree level]] [[string scattering amplitudes]] see at _[[planar limit]]_ for more on this), while $1/N$-corrections correspond to higher [[worldsheet]] [[topology]].

Last not least, these [[surfaces]] have the interpretation of [[open string]] [[worldsheets]] of a [[string theory]] which is "[[duality in string theory|dual]]" to the original ([[super Yang-Mills theory|super]]) in the sense made precise by [[AdS-CFT duality]].


### Classification of weight systems

Later the same double line technique was used (without any reference to the earlier physics articles(?)) in [Bar-Natan 95, Section 6](#BarNatan95) for discussion of the classification of [[Lie algebra weight systems]] and [[stringy weight systems]] with an eye towards discussion of [[Vassiliev knot invariants]].

> Nowadays we interpret $[$ the [['t Hooft double line notation]] $]$ quite literally as the perturbative expansion of an open string theory, either because the full open string theory is just equal to the gauge
theory (as e.g. for Chern-Simons theory [27]), or because we take an appropriate
low-energy limit (as e.g. for N = 4 SYM [31]).

> The general speculation [1] is that upon summing over the number of holes, (1.1) can be recast as the genus expansion for some closed string theory of coupling $g_s = g_{YM}^2$. This speculation is sometimes justified by appealing to the intuition that diagrams with
a larger and larger number of holes look more and more like smooth closed Riemann surfaces. This intuition is perfectly appropriate for the double-scaled matrix models, where the finite N theory is interpreted as a discretization of the closed Riemann surface; to recover the continuum limit, one must send $N\to \infty$ and tune $t$ to the
critical point $t_c$ where diagrams with a diverging number of holes dominate.

>  However, in AdS/CFT, or in the Gopakumar-Vafa duality [2], $t$ is a free parameter, corresponding on the closed string theory side to a geometric modulus. The intuition described above clearly goes wrong here. 

> A much more fitting way in which the open/closed duality may come about in these cases is for each fatgraph of genus g and
with h holes to be replaced by a closed Riemann surface of the same genus g and with h punctures: each hole is filled and replaced by a single closed string insertion.
