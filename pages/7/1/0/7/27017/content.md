Regarding that for a quantization of a Lie subgroup to be defined in Hopf algebraic language one has to have a Poisson-Lie subgroup in fact. As these are rare, according to Ciccoli, co-isotropic subgroups are a good substitude (on quantum levels they correspond to earlier known coideal subalgebras of Hopf algebras, which Ciccoli also calls co-isotropic):
