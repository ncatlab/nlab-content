An easy introduction for elementary basics is

* [[How to get started]].

The following provides more details.

# Software required to use the $n$Lab #

The $n$Lab displays mathematical symbols using [MathML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML). Most web-browsers -- notably Firefox -- know how to display this. 

But for InternetExplorer one needs the [MathPlayer](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/) plugin. Download is quick and easy and free. 


#How to use a Wiki#

Hit "edit page" to see how pages are coded. Use the [[Sandbox|Sandbox]] to warm up.

**Creating a new page** is done by 

 * first creating a preliminary link (represented by a question mark) by entering double square brackets;

 * then clicking on the question mark and following the instructions.

_Watch out_: the name of a page is case sensitive, so make your link lowercase if it comes at the beginning of a sentence. (`[[like this|Like this]]`.) We loosely agreed to try to follow that and some other naming conventions; see below.

However, this is less of an issue now that we have [[redirects]].

#Note to new contributors#

When you edit a page, you can (and should) put your name (with normal capitalisation and spacing) in the box after 'Submit as'. If you don\'t, then your contribution will be credited to the [[AnonymousCoward]].

Once you edit a page for the first time, your name will appear at the bottom, grayed out with a question mark since there is no page with your name yet.  You may take this as an invitation to create a user page and tell us about yourself.  But if you don't want to or don't have the time right now, you can forget about this. If you just want to show up on [category: people](http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/list/people), then you make a page containing only 'category: people' (or someone else may do this for you).

To create your user page, simply click the question mark that appears next to your name at the bottom of the page after making a modification and add content to the edit box that appears. If you'd like to make a user page prior to modifying an existing page, you can do so by making some trivial modification to the [[Sandbox]], which will put your name at the bottom of the page where you can click the question mark. (Or hack the URL.)

# Naming conventions

These are not set in stone, but we\'re following them for now. Most days, [[Toby Bartels]] goes around and corrects any violations (while reading the new material). But changing page titles results in unnecessary kruft (in [category: redirect](http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/list/redirect)), so you should try to follow these if possible (or dispute them if not!).

* Page titles should contain only ASCII characters.
  * Examples: `[[omega-category]]` instead of `[[$\omega$-category]]` or `[[∞-category]]`.
  * Tricks: To produce '$\omega$-[[omega-category|category]]', try `$\omega$-[[omega-category|category]]`. Unfortunately, [[omega-category|$\omega$-category]] does not work.
  * Reason: It's possible to put non-ASCII characters in a name, but not ones generated by iTeX or &...; character entities, so this can be difficult, depending on your browser. To keep things easy, therefore, use only ASCII characters in links.
  * With the introduction of [[redirects]] to Instiki many non-ASCII links now point to the correct ASCII page, e.g. `[[∞-category]]` is now redirected to [[∞-category]].
* Page titles should be singular nouns.
  * Examples: Use `[[category]]` instead of `[[categories]]`, `[[faithful functor]]` instead of `[[faithful]]`, and `[[categorification]]` instead of `[[categorify]]` or `[[categorified]]`.
  * Tricks: To produce '[[category|categories]]', try `[[category|categories]]`. To produce '[[faithful functor|faithful]] [[endofunctor]]', try `[[faithful functor|faithful]] [[endofunctor]]`.
  * Reason: We want only one page on a given concept, regardless of variations in grammar.
  * Again, with the introduction of [[redirects]] many plural links now point to the singular pages, e.g. [[categories]] gets you to [[category]] without needing to type `[[category|categories]]`. If you find yourself frequently typing `[[internalization|internal to]]`, then you might consider adding a [[redirect]] to [[internalization]] (which we've done now) so that `[[internal to]]` is redirected to [[internal to]].
  * When creating a plural link _to an existing page_, e.g. groupoids, you can now link directly to [[groupoids]] (since [[groupoids]] is redirected to the singular page [[groupoid]] now). This is preferable to [[groupoid]]s. See [[Note on Formatting|?]].

* Page titles should be uncapitalised, except for word words that are always capitalised.
  * Examples: Use `[[homotopy theory]]` instead of `[[Homotopy Theory]]`, but use `[[Lie algebra]]`.
  * Tricks: To produce '[[homotopy theory|Homotopy theory]] is important!', try `[[homotopy theory|Homotopy theory]] is important!`.
  * Reason: We want only one page on a given concept, regardless of variations in grammar.

* Except as contradicted above, use standard American English spelling conventions.
  * Examples: Use `[[internalization]]` instead of `[[internalisation]]` and hyphens as shown in the ASCII-only requirement.
  * Tricks: To produce '[[internalization|internalisation]]', try `[[internalization|internalisation]]`.
  * Reason: Most of this is written by [[Urs Schreiber]] and [[John Baez]], who use American English spelling.

* Regardless of the above, pages named after specific categories should use the capitalised singular abbreviated form.
  * Examples: Use `[[Set]]` instead `[[Sets]]` and `[[Cat]]` instead of `[[Category]]`.
  * Tricks: Although things like '$\Disc: \Set \to \Cat$' work best in math mode and even '$\Set$' alone looks most consistent that way, you have to make the link '[[Set]]' outside math mode.

#How to leave comments and questions#

If you want to make a comment or question about a page without changing its main content, then edit the page and put your comment or question in a __query block__ as shown in this example:

    +-- {: .query}
    How do I ask a question?
    =--

which produces

+-- {: .query}
How do I ask a question?
=--

Note that a query block should be less permanent than the rest of the page; once your comment is addressed or your question is answered, you can probably remove your query block.

If you want to ask a question of a specific person, then you can place a query block on their user page (which is just a page whose title is their name). You should be able to find all user pages [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/list/people).

If your comment or question is more general than a specific page or person, then try the [n-Forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).  Previous discussions have been on the [[General Discussion]] page and on an entry at the [n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html).  These previous discussions should not be added to but you may find your question answered there.  Important answers are being migrated to [[HowTo|this How To]] and the [[FAQ]].  As this is a Wiki, if you find an answer to your question and feel it should be added to one of those then do so.

#How to make a standout box#

If you want to make some text stand out (an important theorem, or slogan), you can do it using a __standout box__:

    +-- {: .standout}
    First quantization is a mystery, but second quantization is a functor. 
    =--

which produces

+-- {: .standout}
First quantization is a mystery, but second quantization is a functor. 
=--

# How to fiddle with the CSS (i.e. create query boxes, etc.) on your personal ncatlab space

To fiddle with the CSS code, go to "Edit web" on the main page of your wiki, and then click on "Stylesheat tweaks". Here you can add new CSS gismos like query boxes and standout boxes. These kind of gismos come from the mechanism of putting CSS classes into the Markdown syntax, in the  [same way](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001820.html) that Jacques created the Theorem environments in Instiki. In other words, a query box is like a theorem environment: it's a way in Markdown to create an HTML block with a specific id, which you can then style in the CSS. You can grab the CSS code for query boxes from the main nLab page. It requires a password to change the CSS, but to view it does not require one. 


# How to search the nLab from firefox # {#SearchPlugins}

Here are some search plugins for firefox that will let you search the nLab from the firefox search bar.

* [[nlab-search.xml:file]]: searches the nLab (like the search box at the top of every page).
* [[nlab-goto.xml:file]]: takes you directly to the page with a given exact title (if it exists; otherwise it takes you to an edit box to create such a page).
* [[nlab-edit.xml:file]]: takes you directly to the "edit" page for a given title.

It would be nice if these had different icons.  To use one or more of these, drop them in the 'searchplugins' directory of your firefox profile.

# How to edit nLab pages in your favorite text editor #

One way to do this is to install [this firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) or another one like it.

If your favorite editor is [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [AucTeX](http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/), you may find the following snippet useful to put in your `.emacs` file:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/\\(www.\\)?ncatlab.org" . latex-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/golem.ph.utexas.edu" . latex-mode))
    (defun nlab-latex-fixes ()
      (when (or (string-match "/\\(www.\\)?ncatlab.org" buffer-file-name)
                (string-match "/golem.ph.utexas.edu" buffer-file-name))
      (longlines-mode t)
      (set (make-local-variable 'TeX-open-quote) "\"")
      (set (make-local-variable 'TeX-close-quote) "\"")))
    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'nlab-latex-fixes)

This will tell Emacs to automatically edit nLab pages (and nCafe comments as well, for good measure) in LaTeX mode, with long lines wrapped using soft returns, and ordinary double-quotes rather than LaTeX ones.

# How to include one page within another #

If you have some material at a page called `foo` that you want to include directly in pages called `bar` and `baz`, then type <nowiki><code>[[!include foo]]</code></nowiki> in `bar` and `baz`.  For an example, see how [[contents]] is included at the tope of this page.  Also see how [[contents]] itself has been formatted so that it will appear as a sidebar when included.

Besides such sidebars that appear in many pages, you can also use inclusion to put in something that contains a bunch of ugly code (such as raw <abbr title="scalable vector graphics">SVG</abbr>) without mucking up the rest of the page.  That is, you put your messy code in `bar/foo` and then put <nowiki><code>[[!include bar/foo]]</code></nowiki> in `bar`.  Note that this is for something that, logically, should appear within `bar` itself, which is why `bar` appears in the name of the included page.

# How to customize the nLab #

You may wish to customize the font scheme (both for math or text) on the nLab, as well as tweak things such as the small edit box for comments. Try the [nLab Stylish theme](http://userstyles.org/styles/17934) theme if you are using Firefox. (Stylish is a plug-in for firefox enabling you to customize websites; it is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108)). The nLab theme changes the fonts on the nLab to a serif-style, and makes the edit box much bigger for an overall more pleasant experience! Experienced users can also do this themselves by tweaking the CSS. You might also want to try a Firefox [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) which allows you to edit the text box using your favourite text editor.

# How to put parentheses in external links #

Since the mechanism for inserting links uses parentheses to delimit the link, it's not obvious how to put parentheses actually in the link itself.  Since Wikipedia uses them a fair bit, it's worth knowing how to put them in.  The trick is to use the URL codes rather than the actual characters.  URL codes are generally used to send "unsafe" characters in URLs (safe characters are `a`-`zA`-`Z0`-`9$-_.+!\*'(),`).  Although parentheses are actually "safe", due to their special meaning for the markdown filter, to put them in URLs here they need to be treated as "unsafe".  URL codes have the syntax `%hex` where `hex` is the index of the character in the ASCII character set represented as a 2-digit hexadecimal.  Wikipedia (among other places) has a [table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters) of the character set from which one can read off the required hexadecimal.  In particular, we see that `(` is `%28` and `)` is `%29`.  Thus
