#How to use a Wiki#

Hit "edit page" to see how pages are coded. Use the [[Sandbox|Sandbox]] to warm up.

**Creating a new page** is done by 

 * first creating a preliminary link (represented by a question mark) by entering double square brackets;

 * then clicking on the question mark and following the instructions.

_Watch out_: the name of a page is case sensitive, so make your link lowercase if it comes at the beginning of a sentence. (`[[like this|Like this]]`.) We loosely agreed to try to follow that and some other naming conventions; see below.

#Note to new contributors#

Once you edit a page, your name will appear at the bottom, grayed out with a question mark since you don't have a user page yet.  You may take this as an invitation to create your user page and tell us about yourself.  But if you don't want to or don't have the time right now, you should also feel free to just make a blank user page for yourself, containing only 'category: people' (so that you show up in the [list of contributors](http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/list/people)).

# Naming conventions

These are not set in stone, but we\'re following them for now. Most days, [[Toby Bartels]] goes around and corrects any violations (while reading the new material). But changing page titles results in unnecessary kruft (in [category: redirect](http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/list/redirect)), so you should try to follow these if possible (or dispute them if not!).

* Page titles should contain only ASCII characters.
  * Examples: `[[omega-category]]` instead of `[[$\omega$-category]]`.
  * Tricks: To produce '$\omega$-[[omega-category|category]]', try `$\omega$-[[omega-category|category]]`. Unfortunately, [[omega-category|$\omega$-category]] does not work.
  * Reason: It\'s possible to put non-ASCII characters in a name, but not ones generated by iTeX or &&#8230;; character entities, so this can be difficult, depending on your browser. To keep things easy, therefore, use only ASCII characters in links.

* Page titles should be singular nouns.
  * Examples: Use `[[category]]` instead of `[[categories]]`, `[[faithful functor]]` instead of `[[faithful]]`, and `[[categorification]]` instead of `[[categorify]]` or `[[categorified]]`.
  * Tricks: To produce '[[category|categories]]', try `[[category|categories]]`. To produce '[[faithful functor|faithful]] [[endofunctor]]', try `[[faithful functor|faithful]] [[endofunctor]]`.
  * Reason: We want only one page on a given concept, regardless of variations in grammar.

* Page titles should be uncapitalised, except for word words that are always capitalised.
  * Examples: Use `[[homotopy theory]]` instead of `[[Homotopy Theory]]`, but use `[[Lie algebra]]`.
  * Tricks: To produce '[[homotopy theory|Homotopy theory]] is important!', try `[[homotopy theory|Homotopy theory]] is important!`.
  * Reason: We want only one page on a given concept, regardless of variations in grammar.

* Except as contradicted above, use standard American English spelling conventions.
  * Examples: Use `[[internalization]]` instead of `[[internalisation]]` and hyphens as shown in the ASCII-only requirement.
  * Tricks: To produce '[[internalization|internalisation]]', try `[[internalization|internalisation]]`.
  * Reason: Most of this is written by [[Urs Schreiber]] and [[John Baez]], who use American English spelling.

* Regardless of the above, pages named after specific categories should use the capitalised singular abbreviated form.
  * Examples: Use `[[Set]]` instead `[[Sets]]` and `[[Cat]]` instead of `[[Category]]`.

#How to leave comments and questions#

If you want to make a comment or question about a page without changing its main content, then edit the page and put your comment or question in a __query block__: a paragraph or paragraphs between `+--{.query}` and `=--`. For example,

    +--{.query}
    How do I ask a question?
    =--

produces

+--{.query}
How do I ask a question?
=--

Note that a query block should be less permanent than the rest of the page; once your comment is addressed or your question is answered, you can probably remove your query block.

If you want to ask a question of a specific person, then you can place a query block on their user page (which is just a page whose title is their name). You should be able to find all user pages [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/list/people).

If your comment or question is more general than a specific page or person, then try [[General Discussion]]. (You probably won\'t need to bother with query blocks there.)
