#How to use a Wiki#

Hit "edit page" to see how pages are coded. Use the [[Sandbox|Sandbox]] to warm up.

**Creating a new page** is done by 

 * first creating a preliminary link (represented by a question mark) by entering double square brackets;

 * then clicking on the question mark and following the instructions.

_Watch out_: the name of a page is case sensitive. We loosely agreed to try to follow some naming conventions. See [[General Discussion]].


#How to leave comments and questions#

If you want to make a comment or question about a page without changing its main content, then edit the page and put your comment or question in a __query block__: a paragraph or paragraphs between `+--{.query}` and `=--`. For example,

    +--{.query}
    How do I ask a question?
    =--

produces

+--{.query}
How do I ask a question?
=--

Note that a query block should be less permanent than the rest of the page; once your comment is addressed or your question is answered, you can probably remove your query block.

If you want to ask a question of a specific person, then you can place a query block on their user page (which is just a page whose title is their name). You should be able to find all user pages [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/list/people).

If your comment or question is more general than a specific page or person, then try [[General Discussion]]. (You probably won\'t need to bother with query blocks there.)
