## Idea

The concept of _super smooth $\infty$-groupoid_ or _super smooth [[geometric homotopy type]]_ is the combination of _[[super ∞-groupoid]]_ and _[[smooth ∞-groupoid]]_. The [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of smooth super-$\infty$-groupoids is a context that realizes [[higher geometry|higher]] [[supergeometry]].

Super smooth $\infty$-groupoids include
[[supermanifolds]], [[super Lie groups]] and their [[deloopings]] etc. Under [[Lie differentiation]] these map to [[super L-∞ algebras]].


## Definition

We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) in some fine technical detail. The other is at _[[smooth super infinity-groupoid]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write 

* [[CartSp]] for the site of [[Cartesian spaces]];

* $InfPoint \coloneqq WAlg^{op}$ for the category of first-order [[infinitesimally thickened points]] (i.e. the [[abstract duality|formal duals]] of [[commutative algebras]] over the [[real numbers]] of the form $\mathbb{R}\oplus V$ with $V$ a finite-dimensional  square-0 [[nilpotent ideal]]).

* $SuperPoint \coloneqq WAlg_{super}^{op}$ for the category of [[superpoints]], by which we here mean the [[formal duals]] to commutative [[superalgebras]] which 
are super-[[Weil algebras]].

There are then "semidirect product" sites $CartSp \rtimes InfinPoint$ and $CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint$ (whose objects are [[Cartesian products]] of the given form inside [[synthetic differential supergeometry]] and whose morphisms are all morphisms in that context (not just the product morphisms)).

Set then 

$$
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes InfPoint)
$$

for the collection of [[formal smooth ∞-groupoids]] (see there) and finally

$$
  SuperSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint)
$$

for that of super smooth $\infty$-groupoid

###### Remark

The [[sites]] in question are alternatingly (co-)[[reflective subcategories]] of each other (we always display [[left adjoints]] above their right adjoints)

$$
  \ast
  \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  CartSp
  \stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\longleftarrow}
  CartSp\rtimes InfPoint
  \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\longleftarrow}}
  CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint  
  \,.
$$


Here

* the first inclusion picks the [[terminal object]] $\mathbb{R}^0$;

* the second inclusion is that of [[reduced objects]]; the coreflection is [[reduction]], sending an algebra to its [[reduced algebra]];

* the third inclusion is that of even-graded algebras, the reflection sends a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra to its even-graded part, the co-reflection sends a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra to its quotient by the ideal generated by its odd part, see at _[superalgebra -- Adjoints to the inclusion of plain algebras](super+algebra#AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra)_.

###### Remark

Passing to [[(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves]], this yields, via [[(∞,1)-Kan extension]], a sequence of [[adjoint quadruples]] as follows:

$$
  \array{
    & && && &\longleftarrow& 
    \\
    & && &\hookrightarrow& &\hookrightarrow& 
    \\
    & &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow&
    \\
    \Delta \colon
    & 
    \infty Grpd
    &\hookrightarrow&
    Smooth \infty Grpd
    &\hookrightarrow&
    FormalSmooth \infty Grpd
    &\hookrightarrow&
    SuperFormalSmooth \infty Grpd
    \\
    & &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow&
    \\
    & &\hookrightarrow&
  }
$$

+-- {: .num_prop #TheProcessOfModalities}
###### Proposition

Passing to the [[adjoint triples]] of [[idempotent monads]] and [[idempotent comonads]] which this induces, then yields 

* on the left the [[shape modality]] $\int$, [[flat modality]] $\flat$ and [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$, 

* in the middle yields the [[reduction modality]] $\Re$, the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Im$ and the [[infinitesimal flat modality]] $\&$. 

* on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit $\rightsquigarrow$ is the [[bosonic modality]] and whose left piece $\rightrightarrows$ produces _super-even_ components, containing all the "[[fermion]] [[currents]]" if one wishes , which in this [[unity of opposites]] hence deserves to be called the _[[fermionic modality]]_. The further right adjoint $R$ is the [[rheonomy modality]].

Hence we get a process of [[adjoint modalities]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && id &\dashv& id 
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{fermionic}{}& \rightrightarrows &\dashv& \rightsquigarrow & \stackrel{bosonic}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{bosonic}{} & \rightsquigarrow &\dashv& \Re & \stackrel{rheonomic}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{reduced}{} & \Re &\dashv& \Im & \stackrel{infinitesimal}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{infinitesimal}{}& \Im &\dashv& \& & \stackrel{\text{&#233;tale}}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{contractible}{}& &#643; &\dashv& \flat & \stackrel{discrete}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{discrete}{}& \flat &\dashv& \sharp & \stackrel{differential}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }
$$

where "$\vee$" denotes inclusion of [[modal types]]. The first level is [[cohesion]], the second is [[differential cohesion]] ([[elasticity]]), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further "square roots" of all infinitesimal generators.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

All the sites are [[∞-cohesive sites]], which gives that we have an [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]]. The composite inclusion on the right is an [∞-cohesive neighbourhood site](differential+cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#PresentationOnInfinitesimalNeighbourhoodSites), whence the inclusion $Smooth\infty Gpd\hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth\infty Grpd$ exhibits [[differential cohesion]].

With this the rightmost adjoint quadruple gives the [[Aufhebung]] of $\Re \dashv \Im$ by $\rightsquigarrow \dashv \R$ and the further opposition $\rightrightarrows \dashv \rightsquigarrow$.
