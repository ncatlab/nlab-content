## Idea

The _Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems_ characterize [[spacetimes]] in the theory of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) which have "singularities", points where the [[Riemann curvature]] is undefined (or would be undefined if these points were included in the spacetime [[manifold]]) such as appears notably in [[black hole spacetimes]].

[Hellman](#Hellman) suggest this theorem as an example of non[[computable physics]]. See [Frank](#Frank) for a response.

A related problem is that of the [maximal Cauchy development for the Einstein equations](#Sbierski). In this case, at least [[Zorn's lemma]] can be avoided.

> Penrose's theorem guarantees, under certain hypotheses, that spacetime is null geodesically incomplete. &lbrack;...&rbrack; The primary point of Kerr's paper is that this theorem has nothing to do with the central ring singularity of his namesake spacetime. The theorem does not tell us that the ring singularity is there: the singularity could, in principle, be excised from the spacetime and replaced with a self-supporting stationary matter distribution without contradicting the theorem in any way.
