## Idea

Super QCD is a [[super Yang-Mills theory]] coupled to [[matter]] which is a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extension of [[quantum chromodynamics]] ([[QCD]], an ordinary [[Yang-Mills theory]] coupled to matter), possibly as one sector of a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extension ([[MSSM]]) of the [[standard model of particle physics]]: In super QCD the [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] have [[superpartners]] given by [[squarks]] and [[gluinos]].
