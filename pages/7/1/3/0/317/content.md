The __terminal category__ is the [[terminal object]] in [[Cat]]. It has (at least up to [[isomorphism]]) a single [[object]] and a single [[morphism]]. It is often denoted $1$ or $\mathbf{1}$.

A [[functor]] from $1$ to any [[category]] $C$ is the same thing as an [[object]] of $C$.

The terminal category is a [[discrete category]] that, as a [[set]], may be called the _singleton_.  As a [[subset]] of the singleton, it is in fact a [[truth value]], true ($\top$).  In general, all of these (and their analogues in [[higher category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]]) may be called the [[point]].
