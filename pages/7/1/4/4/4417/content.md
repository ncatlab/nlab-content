## Idea

In view of the relation between [[categories]] with their [[underlying]] ([[reflexive graph|reflexive]]) [[directed graphs]] and in view of the notion of *[[dagger-categories]]* it makes sense to say that:

A _$\dagger$-graph_ is a ([[reflexive graph|reflexive]]) [[directed graph]] equipped for each [[pair]] of vertices $x,y$ with an [[involution]] $\sigma_{x,y} \colon V(x,y) \to V(y,x)$ on sets of [[edges]] between these vertices, changing the direction.


This is one way to think of _undirected_ graphs as [[directed graphs]] with [[extra structure]]. In fact, some authors define [[pseudographs]] to be directed graphs equipped with such an involution.

The point of the terminology here is that the [[underlying]] graph of any [[dagger-category]] is canonically a dagger-graph, in the above sense.
