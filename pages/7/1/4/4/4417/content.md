## Idea

A _$\dagger$-graph_ is a [[directed graph]] equipped for each pair of vertices $x,y$ with an involution $\sigma_{x,y} : V(x,y) \to V(y,x)$.

This is one way to think of _undirected_ graphs.

The notion of $\dagger$-graph is to that of [[dagger-category]] as the notion of [[directed graph]] is to the ordinary notion of [[category]].
