A _poset_ is a category such that:

* for any pair of objects $x, y$, there is at most one morphism from $x$ to $y$

* if there is a morphism from $x$ to $y$ and a morphism from $y$ to $x$, then $x = y$.

Equivalently, we may define a poset to be a [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[preorder]].

(These definitions are equivalent to whatever definition you may be used to).

Sometimes it is useful to regard a poset equivalently as a category [[enriched category theory|enriched in]] [[(-1)-category|(-1)-categories]].
