## Idea

Much of ordinary mathematics can be thought of as taking place [[internalization|inside]] the archetypical category [[Set]] of sets. In as far as an arbitrary [[category]] may be thought of as a generalization of $Set$, a category is a **universe** inside which mathematics may take place.

Of course, without further assumptions on the category, there is in general very little math that can be formulated inside it, but a few extra properties and structures are usually necessary to provide something interesting.  On the other hand, perhaps too much can be formulated; in the [[terminal category]] everything is trivial; the attitude to take is that any *specific* category is merely one model, while a general *class* of categories is a theory 

For instance:
* If the category is equipped with the structure of a [[site]], then geometrical notions, such as defining [[morphism|arrow]]s locally on the domain with patching conditions (or more generally [[descent]] theory), exist inside it. 
* If it is a [[finitely complete category]], the existence of (finite) [[product]]s and [[terminal object]]s means that [[variety of algebras|varieties of algebras]] can be defined. 
* If the category is a [[topos]] with a [[natural numbers object]], then one can do a certain sort of "ordinary" mathematics inside it, specifically [[predicative mathematics|impredicative]] [[constructive mathematics]] without the fancier tools of [[model theory]] or (ironically) [[category theory]].
* Further extra conditions on the category, such as being a [[Boolean topos]] or being a [[extensive category|superextensive site]], bring the internal mathematics closer to that of $Set$.
