## Statement

Let $X$ be a $T_1$ [[topological space]].

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is a [[fully normal topological space]];

1. $X$ is a [[paracompact topological space]]

([Stone 48](#Stone48))

Since [[metric spaces are fully normal]] it follows as a corollary that [[metric spaces are paracompact]]. Accordingly, this statement is now also known as _Stone's theorem_.

Note that without a separation axiom such as $T_1$, the result fails to hold.  For example, any compact space is paracompact, and any fully normal space is normal, so any non-normal compact space is a paracompact space that's not fully normal.
