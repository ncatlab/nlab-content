## Idea

_Bi-pointed types_ are [[axiom|axiomatizations]] of the [[bi-pointed objects]] in the context of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Definition

A **bi-pointed type** is a type $A$ with two points $a:A$ and $b:A$. Equivalently, it is a type $A$ with a function $\mathrm{Bool} \to A$. Examples include the [[interval type]] and the [[function type]] of the [[natural numbers type]].
