## Idea

The notion of [[compact object]] in an ordinary [[category]] is motivated by the example of [[Top]].  But as $Top$ is an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]], it should also make sense in that context.

## Definition

(...)

An object $X$ in a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] is **compact** if the $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  C(X,-) : C \to C
$$

commutes with all [[(∞,1)-colimits]].
