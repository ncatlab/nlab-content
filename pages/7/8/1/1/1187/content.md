#Idea#

In the category [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s one has the following equivalent definitions of when a [[topological space]] $X$ is _compact_ in that every open cover of it has a finite subcover:

$X$ is compact precisely if the [[hom-functor]] $Top(X,-) : Top \to Top$ commutes with [[filtered category|filtered]] [[colimit]]s.

Conversely, for $C$ any category and $X \in C$, the condition that $C(X,-) : C \to C$ preserves [[filtered category|filtered]] [[colimit]]s imposes  some kind of finiteness condition on $X$. For instance 

* in $C = $ [[Set]] this is the case if the set $X$ is finite;

* in $C =$ [[Grp]] this is the case if the group $X$ is finitely presented as a group.
