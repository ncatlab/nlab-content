## Idea

_Sphere types_ are the [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the [[homotopy type]] of the ([[shape modality|shape]] of) the [[spheres]] in the context of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Definition

The $n$-sphere type is be defined as the [[suspension type]] of the $(n-1)$-sphere type or the iterated suspension of $S^0 := \mathbf{2}$. (a.k.a $\text{Bool}$).

$$S^n := \Sigma^n S^0$$
