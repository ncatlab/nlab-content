## Idea

An _almost locally Euclidean space_ or _ALE space_ for short is a solution to the Euclidean [[Einstein equations]] which is a [[blow-up]] of an [[ADE-orbifold]] singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$ for [[finite group|finite]] [[subgroup]] $\Gamma \hookrightarrow SU(2)$.

## References

An [[ADE classification]] of 4d ALE-spaces is due to

this result is interpreted physically as describing the [[moduli space]] of [[vacua]] of [[gauge theories]] with [[spontaneously broken symmetry]] ("Higgs branches"). See at _[[3d mirror symmetry]]_ for more on this.
