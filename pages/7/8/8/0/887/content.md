A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __linear__ if any two elements that are related in neither order are equal:
$$\forall (x, y: A),\; x \nsim y \;\wedge\; y \nsim x \;\Rightarrow\; x = y$$

The term 'linear' here is in the sense of [[linear order]] (as opposed to a mere [[quasiorder]]); the term 'linear relation' without this context is unlikely to be understood.  (In high-school mathematics, a 'linear relation' is a projective linear function, much as a 'linear function' there is an affine linear function.)
