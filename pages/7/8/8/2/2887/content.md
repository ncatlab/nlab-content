I am an algebraic geometer and currently a postdoc at [UC Berkeley](http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~dary/).

At the moment I am mostly interested in algebraic stacks. A brief list of interests include:

* **Moduli** Chow and Hilbert schemes, Hilbert stacks, higher-dimensional moduli, coarse quotients, ...

* Algebraic spaces and stacks (foundational).

* Riemann-Zariski spaces, valuation theory, rigid geometry

* Two-dimensional sheaf theory.

* Log geometry

* minimal model program, multiplier ideal sheaves

* non-noetherian objects

* **Commutative algebra** (from a geometric viewpoint): divided powers, seminormality, weak normality, ideal closures such as tight closure, absolute flat (and perfect) rings
