_Homotopy coherent category theory_ is the attempt to consistently merge the two 1-categorical tools for handling [[higher category theory|higher categories]]:

* [[homotopy theory]] using [[model category|model catgeories]] and similar structures;

* [[enriched category theory]].

In the case that the category $V$ one is [[enriched category|enriching over]] is itself a [[model category]] or at least a [[category with weak equivalences]] one wishes to generalize [[limit]]s and in particular the [[weighted limit]]s such as as [[end]]s and coends in [[enriched category theory]] to constructions which satisfy the familiar universal properties only _up to coherent [[homotopy]]_.
