_Homotopy coherent category theory_ or [[enriched homotopy theory]] is the attempt to consistently merge the two 1-categorical tools for handling [[higher category theory|higher categories]]:

* [[homotopy theory]] using [[model category|model catgeories]] and similar structures;

* [[enriched category theory]].

In the case that the category $V$ one is [[enriched category|enriching over]] is itself a [[model category]] or at least a [[category with weak equivalences]] one wishes to generalize [[limit]]s and in particular the [[weighted limit]]s such as as [[end]]s and coends in [[enriched category theory]] to constructions which satisfy the familiar universal properties only _up to coherent [[homotopy]]_.

ONE main point is the definition and discussion of a [[homotopy coherent end]] for the case of enrichment over the [[model structure on simplicial sets|model category of simplicial sets]].



In 

* Mike Shulman, _Homotopy limits and colimits and enriched homotopy theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0610194v1))

the general issue of [[enriched homotopy theory]] is addressed and  [[enriched homotopical category|enriched homotopical categories]] are introduced, which are a coherent combination of the notion of [[enriched category]] with that of [[homotopical category]]
