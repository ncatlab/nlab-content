## Idea

A series of results on [[moduli spaces of connections]] in the presence of [[complex structure]] due to ([Donaldson 85](#Donaldson85), [Uhlenbeck-Yau 86](#UhlenbeckYau86)), the most famous of which says that on a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifold]] any [[stable vector bundle|semistable]] [[holomorphic vector bundle]] with trivial [[determinant line bundle]] admits a [[Hermite-Einstein connection]]. 

The theorem is recalled for instance as ([Scheinost-Schottenloher 96, theorem 1.15](#ScheinostSchottenloher96)). This result is a key step in the construction of the [[Kähler polarization]] on a [[moduli space of flat connections]] via [[symplectic reduction]] ([Scheinost-Schottenloher 96, corollary 1.16](#ScheinostSchottenloher96)), a [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] version of the Griffiths [[intermediate Jacobian]] $J^1$ (see there at _[Examples -- Picard variety](intermediate+Jacobian#ExamplePicard)_).


The correspondence between [[stable vector bundle|semi-stable vector bundles]] and [[Hermite-Einstein connections]] holds more generally over [[complex manifolds]], where it is known as the _[[Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence]]_. The special case of that over [[Riemann surfaces]] in turn is essentially the _[[Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem]]_.
