## Idea

This is a generalization of the [[Seely isomorphism]] to [[graded modalities]]. A graded exponential modality $(!_{r}:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C})_{r \in R}$ graded by some [[rig]] $R$ and in a [[CMon-enriched symmetric monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ verifies the graded Seely isomorphism iff we have:
$$
!_{r}(A \oplus B) \cong \underset{s+t=r}{\bigoplus} !_{s}A \otimes !_{t}A
$$
One needs to combine [[graded linear logic]] and [[differential linear logic]] to go from the usual Seely isomorphism of linear logic to the more general graded Seely isomorphism. The usual Seely isomorphism is obtained as a graded Seely isomorphism when one takes $R$ equal to the zero rig.
