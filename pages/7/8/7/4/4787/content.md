## Idea

There are many notions of _dimension_.  What they all have in common is that the [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ has dimension $n$.


## Examples

*  The __dimension__ of a [[vector space]] $V$ is the [[cardinality]] of any [[set]] $X$ such that $V$ is [[free object|free]] (as a vector space) on $X$.  (It is a theorem, equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], there every vector space has a unique dimension.)  For [[modules]] over [[rings]] that are not [[fields]] (for which the theorem above does not hold, neither existence nor uniqueness) the term used is [[rank]].

*  A [[manifold]] is of __dimension__ $n$ if it is locally isomorphic to the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.  A [[complex manifold]] is of __complex dimension__ $n$ if it is locally isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$, hence has (real) dimension $2 n$.

*  A [[topological space]] $X$ has (Lebesgue) __dimension__ less than $n$ if every [[open cover]] $U$ of $X$ has a [[refinement]] $V$ such that every element of $X$ belongs to fewer than $n + 1$ elements of $V$.  (Then $X$ has dimension $n$ if it has dimension less than $n + 1$ but not less than $n$.)  By [[negative thinking]], this makes sense for $n \geq -1$; precisely the [[empty space]] has dimension $-1$, and precisely a [[zero-dimensional space]] (of course) has dimension $0$.

*  A [[metric space]] has a __[[Hausdorff dimension]]__ which may be any non-negative real number.
