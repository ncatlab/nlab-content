#Idea#

A **Courant algebroid** is a structure pairing the notion of a tangent [[Lie algebroid]] with that of a Lie algebra equipped with a bilinear symmetric invariant form.

By the [[red herring principle]] a Courant algebroid is neither an [[algebroid]] nor in fact in general a [[Lie algebroid]], but is a generalization of [[Lie bialgebroid]]. 

* every [[Lie bialgebroid]] induced a Courant algebroid.

* every Courant algebroid induces a [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] which is the [[string Lie 2-algebra]] if the base space is a point.


The concept of Courant algebroids was originally introduced by T. Courant to study [[geometric quantization]] in the presence of constraints. Later it was studied by Liu, Weinstein and Xu in the study of [[double Lie algebroid]]s.

There are various different-looking definitions of Courant algebroids and in parts of the literature a clear notion of morphisms and equivalences is missing. The picture was eventually clarified in particular by work of Dmitry Roytenberg.

The two main definitions differ in that

* in one there is a skew-symmetric bracket which fails to satisfy a Jacobi identity by a coherent term;

* in the other there is a bracket which satisfies a Jacobi identity but is skew-symmetric only up to a correction term.

This has eventually led Dmitry Roytenberg in _Roytenberg07_ (see below) to identify the concept of a [[hemistrict Lie 2-algebra]] in which both the Jacobi identity and the skew symmetry may be weakened and clarify its relation to semistrict Lie 2-algebras which are strictly skew symmetric but may have a nontrivial Jacobiator.

The nature of Courant's original definition as an $L_\infty$-structure was recognized in _RoytenbergWeinstein98_ (see references below). Equation (9) and theorem 4.3 there gives the [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] corresponding to a Courant Lie algebroid (the way the tangent Lie algebroid gives the Lie algebra of vector fields). This perspective makes manifest that the Courant Lie algebroid with base space a point is the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

This was further developed in the thesis _Roytenberg99_.
