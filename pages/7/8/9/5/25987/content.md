## Idea
 {#Idea}

[Grothendieck 1965](#Grothendieck65) understood [[spaces]] as locally [[representable functor|representable]] [[sheaves]] over a fixed [[site]] whose objects are interpreted as local models ("[[functorial geometry]]"). If local models are [[affine schemes]], then [[schemes]] and [[algebraic spaces]] can be considered as an example. 


## Schemes as presheaves
 {#SchemesAsPresheaves}

Given a [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[ground ring]] $R$, let  $Scheme$ denote the [[category]] of [[schemes]] (over $R$) regarded as [[locally ringed topological spaces]], and let $Aff \hookrightarrow Scheme$ denote its [[full subcategory]] of [[affine schemes]].

The assgnment which takes $Y \in Scheme$ to the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] $Spec(-)$ of the [[global sections]] $\Gamma_Y(-)$ of its [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_Y$
$$
  Y
   \mapsto 
  Spec\big(
    \Gamma_Y (\mathcal{O}_Y)
  \big)
$$
extends to a [[functor]]
$$
  Scheme \longrightarrow Aff
  \,.
$$

A basic result, sometimes referred to as the __fundamental theorem on morphisms of schemes__, says that there is a [[bijection]]  
$$
  CRing\big(R, \Gamma_Y\mathcal{O}_Y\big) 
    \;\cong\; 
  Scheme(Y, Spec R).
$$

More precisely, for a fixed [[scheme]] $Y$, and for varying $R$ there is a [[restriction]] functor  
$$
  Scheme(-,Y)\vert_{Aff^{op}} 
    \;=\; 
  h_Y|_{Aff^{op}} 
    \;=\; 
  h_Y|_{CRing}   
    \,\colon\, 
  CRing \longrightarrow Set
  \,,
$$ 
and the functor
$$
  Y 
    \,\mapsto\, 
  h_Y|_{CRing}
$$
from schemes to presheaves on $Aff = CRing^{op}$ is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]].
Thus, schemes in the sense of [[ringed spaces]], indeed form a [[full subcategory]] of the [[category of presheaves]] on $Aff$. 

In fact, the theorem is more general: instead of $Y$ being a scheme, we can take any locally ringed space. Thus the entire category of locally ringed spaces embeds into the category of presheaves on $Aff$.


## Schemes as locally representable sheaves

One can characterize the [[essential image]] of the category of [[schemes]] in the category of [[presheaves]] over the category of [[affine schemes]], as the [[full subcategory]] spanned by those [[small presheaves]] that are $\tau$-locally representable and are $\tau$-sheaves, where $\tau$ is the [[Zariski topology]] on $Aff$. 

More precisely, let $AffSch \coloneqq CRing^{op}$ denote the [[category]] of [[affine schemes]] but now defined as the [[opposite category]] of that of commutative (unital) rings.
Define the [[Zariski topology]] on $AffSch$ as the [[Grothendieck topology]] generated by the [[coverage]] given by families
$$\{Spec R[r^{-1}] \to Spec R\mid r\in R\}$$
for all $R\in AffSch$.

Now consider the category of [[small sheaves]] on the site $AffSch$, i.e., the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[small presheaves]] on $AffSch$ that satisfy the gluing property with respect to every covering family in the coverage.

A presheaf $F$ is __locally representable__ if there is a set-indexed [[covering family]]
$$f_i\colon X_i\to F,$$
where $X_i$ is the representable sheaf of an [[affine scheme]] and the morphisms $f_i$ are [[open immersions]].

Open immersions of presheaves are defined as follows.
A morphism of presheaves
$$F\to G$$
is an [[open immersion]] if for every presheaf $X$ represented by an [[affine scheme]] and every morphism
$$X\to G,$$
the [[base change]]
$$X\times_G F\to X$$
is an [[open immersion]].
