I was a graduate student in the Logic program at Berkeley, broadly interested in categorical logic and foundations of mathematics, as well as in applications of category theory to the semantics of programming languages.

I left academia for industry in 2013, but I do still have many of the same interests. From 2021 to 2023, I worked in my free time to write my previously unwritten dissertation, and thus I finished the PhD I had originally left ABD.
