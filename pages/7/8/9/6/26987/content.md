## Idea

In [[probability theory]], the *law of large numbers* states that the [[empirical mean]] of a [[stochastic process|process]] where the [[random variables]] are [[iid random variables|independent and identically distributed]] tends to its [[expectation value]]. 

It can be seen as a mathematical formalization of the idea that, even in presence of randomness, the *average behavior* of a system tends to be predictable, and the larger the sample size is, the better the prediction is. 

For example, when rolling a fair die repeatedly, the average of the number rolled tends to 
$$
\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} \;=\; 3.5 .
$$

## Main statements
