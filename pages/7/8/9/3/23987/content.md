The *[Center for Quantum and Topological Systems](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-quantum-and-topological-systems.html)* (CQTS)  is a Research Center, launching in 2022, within the [Research Institute](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/research-institute-centers.html) of [New York University in Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).

[CQTS](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-quantum-and-topological-systems.html) hosts cross-disciplinary research on *[[topological physics -- contents|topological]] [[quantum systems]]*,  such as [[topological phases of matter]] understood [[AdS-CFT in condensed matter physics|via holography]] and using tools from [[topological data analysis]], ultimately aimed at addressing open questions in [[topological quantum computation]]. A unifying theme is the use of new methods from ("[[persistent cohomotopy|persistent]]") *[[Cohomotopy]]* and [[generalized cohomology]]-theory, developed [[schreiber:Hypothesis H|in high energy physics]].

    **Persistent homotopy groups of metric spaces**

    \linebreak

    > By capturing both geometric and topological features of datasets, [[persistent homology]] has shown its promise in applications. Motivated by the fact that [[homotopy]] in general contains more information than [[homology]], we study notions of [[persistent homotopy]] groups of compact [[metric spaces]], together with their stability properties in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Under fairly mild assumptions on the spaces, we proved that the classical [[fundamental group]] has an underlying tree-like structure (i.e. a dendrogram) and an associated ultrametric. We then exhibit pairs of filtrations that are confounded by [[persistent homology]] but are distinguished by their [[persistent homotopy]] groups. We finally describe the notion of persistent [[rational homotopy theory|rational]] homotopy groups, which is easier to handle but still contains extra information compared to persistent homology.

    **Realisations of Posets**

    \linebreak

    > My presentation  is based on an article with the same title coauthored with A. Jin and F. Tombari  ([arXiv:2112.12209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12209)).

    > Encoding information in form of  [[functors]] indexed by the [[poset]] of $r$-tuples of real numbers ([[persistence modules]]) is attractive for three reasons: 
       
    > a) metric properties  of the poset are essential  to study  distances on persistence modules

    > b) the poset of $r$-tuples of real numbers has well behaved discrete  approximations which are  used  to provide finite  approximations of  persistence modules 
       
    > c) the mentioned discretizations and approximations  have well studied algebraic and homological properties as they can be identified with  multi graded modules over polynomial rings.

    > In my talk I will describe a construction called realisation, that transforms arbitrary posets into posets  which satisfy all three requirements above and hence  are particularly suitable for persistence methods.Intuitively the realisation associates a continuous structure to a locally discrete poset by filling in empty spaces. For example the realisation of the poset of natural numbers is the poset of non-negative reals. I will focus on illustrating how [[homological algebra|homological techniques]], such as [[Koszul complexes]], can be used to study [[persistence modules]] indexed by realisations.

    **Thoughts on big data sets**

    \linebreak

    > This talk describes work in progress. The idea is to develop methods for analyzing a very large data sets $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ in high dimensional spaces. There are well-known pitfalls to avoid, including the inability to computationally analyze [[TDA]] constructions for $X$ on account of its size, the "curse of high dimensionality", and the failure of [[excision]] for standard [[TDA]] constructions. We discuss the curse of high dimensionality and define a hypercube metric on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that may lessen its effects. The excision problem for the [[Vietoris-Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips construction]] can be addressed by expanding the [[TDA]] discussion to [[filtered object|filtered]] subobjects $K$ of Vietoris-Rips constructions. Unions of such subobjects satisfy excision in path components (clusters) and [[homology groups]], by classical results. The near-term goal is to construct, for each data point $x$, a "computable" filtered subcomplex $K_{x} \subset V(X)$ with $x \in K_{x}$, which would capture spatial local behaviour of the data set $X$ near $x$. A large (but highly parallelizable) algorithm finds a nearest neighbour, or a set of $k$-nearest neighbours for a fixed data point $x \in X$. Some variant of this algorithm may lead to a good construction of the local subcomplex $K_{x}$.

## CQTS Colloquium

### May 2022

* [[Urs Schreiber]]:

  **[[schreiber:New Foundations for TDA -- Cohomotopy|New Foundations for Topological Data Analysis -- The Power of Cohomotopy]]**
  {#CQTSColloquiumCohomotopyFoundationsForTDA}

  \linebreak

  > **Abstract.** The aim of *[[topological data analysis]]* (TDA) is to provide qualitative analysis of large data/parameter sets in a way which is *robust* against uncertainties and noise. This is accomplished using tools and theorems from the mathematical field of *[[algebraic topology]]*. While a tool called *[[persistent homology]]* has become the signature method of TDA, it tends to produce answers that are either hard to interpret (persistent [[cycles]]) or impossible to compute ([[well groups]]). Both problems are solved by a variant method $[$[FK17](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcal17)$]$ which we may call *[[persistent cohomotopy]]*: A first result shows $[$[FKW18](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcalWagner18)$]$ that this new method provides computable answers to the concrete question of detecting whether there exist data+parameters that meet a prescribed target indicator precisely, even in the presence of uncertainty and noise. More generally, efficient data analysis will require further refining [[persistent cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant cohomotopy]] and/or [[twisted cohomotopy]] $[$[[schreiber:Proper Orbifold Cohomology|SS20]]$]$. Curiously, these flavors of [[cohomotopy theory]] have [[schreiber:Hypothesis H|profound relations]] to [[string theory|formal high energy physics]] and [[nLab:topological phase of matter|quantum materials]], connecting to which might help to further enhance the power of [[topological data analysis]].

  **Higher quantum geometry and global string duality**

  [zoom recording](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/smsfBPZ5n5poB889nfwEzjcb20_SrsgCcFOJBcg492YsxbhCwTz1-8OXxJBGVvxx.CZRA2MziA5nleJWP)

  > In this talk I will discuss the relation between [[higher geometric quantisation]] and the [global geometry underlying](double+field+theory#ReferencesInHigherDifferentialGeometry) [[duality in string theory|string dualities]]. Higher geometric quantisation is a promising framework that makes quantisation of [[classical field theories]] achievable. This can be obtained by quantising either an ordinary prequantum bundle on the ∞-stack of solutions of the equations of motion or a categorified prequantum bundle on a generalised phase space. I will discuss how the higher quantum geometry of string theory underlies the [[topological T-duality|global geometry of]] [[T-duality]]. In particular, I will illustrate how a globally well-defined moduli stack of [[tensor hierarchies]] can be constructed and why this is related to a higher gauge theory with the [[string 2-group]]. Finally, I will interpret the formalism of Extended Field Theory as an atlas description of the higher quantum geometry of string theory.

  **The geometric cobordism hypothesis**

  > I will explain my recent work with [[Daniel Grady]] on locality of [[FQFT|functorial field theories]] ([arXiv:2011.01208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01208)) and the geometric [[cobordism hypothesis]] ([arXiv:2111.01095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01095)). The latter generalizes the Baez–Dolan cobordism hypothesis to nontopological field theories, in which bordisms can be equipped with geometric structures, such as smooth maps to a fixed target manifold, Riemannian metrics, [[conformal structures]], [[principal bundles]] [[connection on a principal bundle|with connection]], or [[differential string structure|geometric]] [[string structures]].

  > Applications include a generalization of the [Galatius–Madsen–Tillmann–Weiss theorem](cobordism+category#GMTWTheorem), a solution to a conjecture of Stolz and Teichner on representability of concordance classes of functorial field theories, a construction of [[power operations]] on the level of field theories (extending the recent work of Barthel–Berwick-Evans–Stapleton), and a recent solution by Grady of a conjecture by Freed and Hopkins on deformation classes of reflection positive [[invertible field theories]]. If time permits, I will talk about the planned future work on nonperturbative quantization of functorial field theories and generalized Atiyah–Singer-style index theorems.

  **The Kervaire Invariant, multiplicative norms, and N-infinity operads**

  [zoom recording](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/GGfyckAXd17ket9Oc24UiymACRyk68rkEHYywkN5q8fzLrVBq_0uUKyRAppbgBHR.8mbsXTDkkeCeWRbp)

  > In a 2016 Annals paper, Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel solved the [[Arf-Kervaire invariant problem|Kervaire Invariant One Problem]] using tools from [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. This problem goes back over 60 years, to the days of Milnorand the discovery of exotic smooth structures on spheres. Of particular importance it its solution were equivariant commutative ring spectra and their multiplicative norms. A more thorough investigation of multiplicative norms, using the language of operads, was recently conducted by Blumberg and Hill, though the existence in general of their new “N-infinity” operads was left as a conjecture. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the Kervaire problem and its solution, I will explain where the [[operads]] enter the story, and I will prove the Blumberg-Hill conjecture using a new model structure on the categoryof equivariant operads.

  **How open space index theory appears in physics**

  > The incredible stability of [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall systems]] and [[topological phase of matter|topological phases]] indicates protection by an underlying [[index theorem]]. In contrast to Atiyah-Singer theory for compactified problems, what is required is an index theory on noncompact Riemannian manifolds, with interplay between discrete and continuous spectra. Input data comes not from a topological category a la [[TQFT]], but a metrically-coarsened one. This is the subject of coarse geometry and index theory, and I will explain their experimental manifestations.

Stone-von Neumann**

  > One of the first interesting [[braid group representation|representations of]] the [[braid groups]] is the [[Burau representation]]. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the [[mapping class group]] of a punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but the $k = 2$ Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem of Bigelow and Krammer and implies immediately that braid groups are linear (act faithfully on finite-dimensional vector spaces). Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are linear, I will describe [recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00515) in which we construct analogues of the  awrence representations for mapping class groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology of con guration spaces, Schr&ouml;dinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

  > [[differential cohomology|Differential generalized cohomologies]] refine generalized cohomologies on manifolds so as to retain information on differential forms. The aim of my talk is to describe formulations of [[differential K-theory|differential]] [[KO-theory]] based on gradations and [[mass terms]]. The formulation based on mass terms is motivated by a conjecture of Freed and Hopkins about a classification of invertible quantum field theories and by a model of the Anderson dual of cobordism theory given by Yamashita and Yonekura. I will start with an account of this background, and then describe the formulation of differential KO-theory. In the formulation a key role is played by a uperconnection associated to a mass term. This is a joint work with Mayuko Yamashita.

  **The Baum-Connes conjecture for groups and groupoids**

  > Abstract: In this talk we present some basics definitions around the [[Baum-Connes conjecture]] in the context of groups and groupoids, in particular we define the reduced $C^\ast$-algebra $C_r^*(G)$ of a groupoid G. When a group (or groupoid) satisfies this conjecture we present how we can compute the topological K-theory of $C_r^*(G)$ via a classifying space. We also present some explicit computations and an application about Fredholm boundary conditions in manifolds with corners.

  **Equvariant twisted KK-theory of noncompact Lie groups**

  > The [[Loop Groups and Twisted K-Theory|Freed-Hopkins-Teleman theorem]] asserts a canonical link between the [[twisted ad-equivariant K-theory|equivariant twisted K-theory]] of a [[compact Lie group]] equipped with the conjugation action by itself and the representation theory of its loop group. Motivated by this, we will present results on the [[twisted equivariant K-theory|equivariant twisted]] [[KK-theory]] of a noncompact semisimple Lie group $G$. We will give a geometric description of generators of the equivariant twisted KK-theory of G with equivariant correspondences, which are applied to formulate the geometric quantization of quasi-Hamiltonian manifolds with proper G-actions. We will also show that the Baum-Connes [[assembly map]] for the $C^\ast$-algebra of sections of the Dixmier-Douady bundle which realizes the twist is an isomorphism, and discuss a conjecture on representations of the loop group $L G$. This talk is based on joint work with [[Mathai Varghese]].
