[CQTS](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-quantum-and-topological-systems.html) hosts cross-disciplinary research on *[[topological physics -- contents|topological]] [[quantum systems]]*,  such as [[topological phases of matter]] understood [[AdS-CFT in condensed matter physics|via holography]] and using tools from [[algebraic topology]], ultimately aimed at addressing open questions in [[topological quantum computation|topological]] [[quantum computation]]. A unifying theme is the use of new methods from ([[persistent cohomotopy|persistent]]) *[[Cohomotopy]]* ([[schreiber:M/F-Theory as Mf-Theory|aka]] *[[framed manifold|framed]] [[cobordism cohomology|Cobordism]]*, [aka](stable+cohomotopy#AsAlgebraicKTheoryOverTheFieldWithOneElement) *[[field with one element|absolute $\mathbb{F}_1$]]-[[algebraic K-theory]]*) and [[generalized cohomology|generalized]] [[twisted cohomology|Twisted]] [[equivariant cohomology|Equivariant]] [[differential cohomology|Differential]] ([[schreiber:Twisted Equivariant Differential non-abelian generalized cohomology|TED]]) [[cohomology]], developed [[Hypothesis H|in string theory]].

    **Persistent homotopy groups of metric spaces**

    > By capturing both geometric and topological features of datasets, [[persistent homology]] has shown its promise in applications. Motivated by the fact that [[homotopy]] in general contains more information than [[homology]], we study notions of [[persistent homotopy]] groups of compact [[metric spaces]], together with their stability properties in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Under fairly mild assumptions on the spaces, we proved that the classical [[fundamental group]] has an underlying tree-like structure (i.e. a dendrogram) and an associated ultrametric. We then exhibit pairs of filtrations that are confounded by [[persistent homology]] but are distinguished by their [[persistent homotopy]] groups. We finally describe the notion of persistent [[rational homotopy theory|rational]] homotopy groups, which is easier to handle but still contains extra information compared to persistent homology.

    **Realisations of Posets**

    > My presentation  is based on an article with the same title coauthored with A. Jin and F. Tombari  ([arXiv:2112.12209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12209)).

    > Encoding information in form of  [[functors]] indexed by the [[poset]] of $r$-tuples of real numbers ([[persistence modules]]) is attractive for three reasons: 
       
    > a) metric properties  of the poset are essential  to study  distances on persistence modules

    > b) the poset of $r$-tuples of real numbers has well behaved discrete  approximations which are  used  to provide finite  approximations of  persistence modules 
       
    > c) the mentioned discretizations and approximations  have well studied algebraic and homological properties as they can be identified with  multi graded modules over polynomial rings.

    > In my talk I will describe a construction called realisation, that transforms arbitrary posets into posets  which satisfy all three requirements above and hence  are particularly suitable for persistence methods.Intuitively the realisation associates a continuous structure to a locally discrete poset by filling in empty spaces. For example the realisation of the poset of natural numbers is the poset of non-negative reals. I will focus on illustrating how [[homological algebra|homological techniques]], such as [[Koszul complexes]], can be used to study [[persistence modules]] indexed by realisations.

    **Thoughts on big data sets**


    > This talk describes work in progress. The idea is to develop methods for analyzing a very large data sets $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ in high dimensional spaces. There are well-known pitfalls to avoid, including the inability to computationally analyze [[TDA]] constructions for $X$ on account of its size, the "curse of high dimensionality", and the failure of [[excision]] for standard [[TDA]] constructions. We discuss the curse of high dimensionality and define a hypercube metric on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that may lessen its effects. The excision problem for the [[Vietoris-Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips construction]] can be addressed by expanding the [[TDA]] discussion to [[filtered object|filtered]] subobjects $K$ of Vietoris-Rips constructions. Unions of such subobjects satisfy excision in path components (clusters) and [[homology groups]], by classical results. The near-term goal is to construct, for each data point $x$, a "computable" filtered subcomplex $K_{x} \subset V(X)$ with $x \in K_{x}$, which would capture spatial local behaviour of the data set $X$ near $x$. A large (but highly parallelizable) algorithm finds a nearest neighbour, or a set of $k$-nearest neighbours for a fixed data point $x \in X$. Some variant of this algorithm may lead to a good construction of the local subcomplex $K_{x}$.

  > In this series of three talks we will explain the foam approach to [[link homology]]. Bigraded link homology theories [[categorification|categorify]] the [[Jones polynomial]] and other [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction|Reshetikhin-Turaev]] [[link invariants]], such as the [[HOMFLY-PT polynomial]]. Foams, which are [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] 2D [[cell complex|complexes]] embedded in [[Euclidean space|3-space]] allow to construct state spaces for [[planar graphs]] which are then used to define link homology groups. The most explicit and efficient way to define graph state spaces is via evaluation of the closed foams (Robert-Wagner formula).

  > A) This formula will be first explained in the less technical unoriented $SL(3)$ case. Resulting graph state spaces are then related to the Four-Color Theorem and Kronheimer-Mrowka homology for 3-[[orbifolds]].

  > B) A step in that construction requires building a topological theory (a lax TQFT) from an evaluation of closed objects, such as closed $n$-manifolds. We will explain the setup for topological theories, including in two dimensions, recovering the Deligne categories and their generalizations. In one dimension and adding defects, these topological theories are related to noncommutative power series, pseudocharacters, and, over the Boolean semiring, to [[regular languages]] and [[automata]].

  > C) Robert-Wagner $GL(N)$ foam evaluation and its application to constructing link homology theories will be explained as well.

  > [[quantum field theory|Quantum field theories]] can have an inconsistency called an [[quantum anomaly|anomaly]], formulated as an [[invertible field theory]] in one dimension higher. Theorems of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman and [Freed-Hopkins](invertible+field+theory#FreedHopkins21) classify [[invertible field theories]] in terms of [[bordism groups]]. In this talk, I'll apply this to the low-energy approximation of $E_8 \times E_8$ [[heterotic string theory]]; Witten proved anomaly cancellation in a restricted setting, but we perform a twisted string bordism computation to show that the relevant group of 11-dimensional [[invertible field theories]] does not vanish, and therefore there could be an anomaly in $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory. Standard computational techniques for twisted [[string bordism]] do not work for this problem; I will also discuss work joint with Matthew Yu using Baker-Lazarev's R-module Adams spectral sequence to simplify a large class of twisted spin and string bordism computations.

One of the central axioms is a certain local constancy condition, called the [[time-slice axiom]], that encodes a concept of time evolution. Using [[model category|model categorical]] [[localization of model categories|localization]] techniques, I will show that this i.g. [[homotopy]]-[[coherence|coherent]] time evolution admits a [[rectification|strictification]] in many relevant cases.

  > Quasi-alternating links represent an important class of [[links]] that has been [introduced by Ozsváth and Szabó](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309170) while studying the Heegaard Floer homology of the branched double-covers of alternating links. This new class of links, which share many [[Khovanov homology|homological properties]] with alternating links, is defined in a recursive way which is not easy to use in order to determine whether a given link is quasi-alternating. In this talk, we shall review the main obstruction criteria for quasi-alternating links. We also discuss how new examples of quasi-alternating links can constructed.

  > Since the mid 1980s, there have been hints of a deep connection between [[2d CFT|2-dimensional]] [[quantum field theory|field theories]] and [[elliptic cohomology]]. This lead to [[What is an elliptic object?|Stolz and Teichner's conjectured geometric model]] for the universal [[elliptic cohomology]] [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology|theory]] of [[topological modular forms]] ([[TMF]]) in which [[cocycles]] are [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory|2-dimensional supersymmetric field theories]].

The [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|work of Sati and Schreiber]] highlighted the connection between ([[horizontal chord diagram|horizontal]]) [[chord diagrams]] and higher [[quantum observable|observables]] in quantum [[brane]] physics. This motivates the question: "which [[weight systems]] are [[state on a star-algebra|quantum states]]?" [[schreiber:Fundamental weight systems are quantum states|Corfield, Sati and Schreiber showed]] that all $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ [[weight systems]] associated to the [[fundamental representation|defining representation]] are indeed [[state on a star-algebra|quantum states]].

  > In the [[swampland]] program one tries to delineate [[effective quantum field theory|effective theories]] consistent with [[quantum gravity]] from those which are not by so-called swampland conjecture. As a consequence of the absence of [[global symmetries]] in [[quantum gravity|QG]], [one such conjecture](swampland#SwamplandCobordismConjecture) is saying that the [[cobordism group]] has to vanish. In mathematics very often these groups do not vanish right away. Physics tells us that this can be ameliorated by either [[gauge symmetry|gauging]] or [[symmetry breaking|breaking]] of the corresponding global symmetries.

  > First, we show how the gauging fits into some known constraints in [[string theory]], the so-called [[tadpole cancellation]] conditions. Mathematically, this is reflecting a well-known connection between certain [[topological K-theory|K-theory]] and [[cobordism groups]]. Second, we report on new results related to the breaking of a global symmetry via [[codimension]] one [[defect QFT|defects]]. In fact, going beyond topology a very similar mechanism arises for (for a long time puzzling) rolling solutions in string theory, giving rise to the notion of a dynamical cobordism conjecture.

  > For a generic two-dimensional [[topological insulator]] with band inversion and [[spin-orbit coupling]], we propose the generation of topological zero-energy [[bound states]] via the application of an in-plane Zeeman field breaking rotational invariance. The Zeeman field induces a surface gap and generates the topological states via a second-order mechanism generically at the surface positions where the normal component of the Zeeman field vanishes. Via the application of an additional half-integer [[Aharonov-Bohm effect|Aharonov-Bohm]] [[flux]] through a hole of the system, we show that the topological states are protected by supersymmetry. For smooth surfaces, we derive an effective surface Hamiltonian in the form of a periodic Witten model and propose how the surface bound states of the supersymmetric spectrum can be calculated via a trapping mechanism in effective surface potentials. We study the whole phase diagram of the model together with its stability and discuss the high tunability of the topological states.

Using this construction, I will prove that [[D=4 supergravity|four-dimensional]] bosonic un[[gauged supergravity|gauged]] [[supergravity]] is completely determined by a choice of polarized Siegel bundle defined over the total space of a vertically [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[submersion]] equipped with a complete [[Ehresmann connection]], showing that its gauge sector reduces to a polarized [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-duality condition]] for connections on the underlying polarized Siegel bundle. Furthermore, I will explore the continuous and arithmetic [[U-duality]] groups of the theory, characterizing them through [[short exact sequences]] and realizing the latter through the [[automorphism group]] of the underlying Siegel bundle acting on its [[adjoint bundle]]. This elucidates the geometric origin of [[U-duality]] and justifies the miraculous existence of U-dualities by describing them as a [[gauge transformation]] of the appropriately defined [[principal bundle]].

We first observe that the decomposition of the pure Yang-Mills aligns perfectly with the decomposition of $S_n$ Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, and then discuss decomposition and the branched covers interpretation.

I present an approach based on [[homotopy algebras]] such as [[L-infinity algebras|L-infinity algebras]] that allows one to provide such a first-principle derivation, at least to some finite order in [[perturbation theory]].

A natural generalisation of [Sen's action](self-dual+higher+gauge+theory#Sen20) is presented in which the Minkowski metric is replaced by a second metric on spacetime. The theory is covariant and can be formulated on any spacetime. The theory describes a physical sector, consisting of the [[self-dual higher gauge theory|chiral $p$-form gauge field]] coupled to the dynamical metric $g$, plus a shadow sector consisting of a second chiral $p$-form and the second metric. The resulting theory is covariant and can be formulated on any spacetime. A spacetime with two metrics has some interesting geometry and some of this is explored here and used in the construction of the interactions. The action has two [[diffeomorphism]]-like symmetries, one acting only on the physical sector and one acting only on the shadow sector, with the spacetime diffeomorphism symmetry arising as the diagonal subgroup.

One useful operation is that of a [[partial integration]] (BV [[pushforward]]), which produces a [[chain map]] that, under some assumptions, is a [[quasiisomorphism]].

  **Supergravity as Super-Cartan Geometry on Super-spacetime**

  > It is well-known that [[supergravity]] admits a [[super-spacetime]] formulation, which in modern language revolves around [[super Cartan geometry]] modeled on a [[coset space]] of the corresponding [[super-Poincaré group]]. After describing [[Einstein gravity|ordinary gravity]] in terms of [[Cartan geometry]], I will recall its [[D=4 supergravity|$D=4$ supersymmetric extension]] via the addition of a ([[fermion|fermionic]]) [[spinor]] -- the [[gravitino]]. In passing, I shall explain how the correct mathematical language to describe such fermionic fields on a bosonic spacetime is that of (smooth)  [[smooth super set|super sets]]. I will then recall one of its standard [[super-spacetime]] formulations, as a theory of a single super-[[Cartan connection]] obeying the analogous [[field equations]], paralleling that of [[Einstein gravity|ordinary $D=4$ gravity]]. In [[D=11 supergravity|D=11]], [[supersymmetry]] demands the existence of a [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] with 4-form flux density $G_4$ -- along with its ([[on-shell]]) [[Hodge duality|dual]] 7-form flux $G_7$. I will conclude by describing a concise formulation of [[on-shell]] [[D=11 supergravity|$D=11$ supergravity]] as a form of ([[higher geometry|higher]]) [[super-Cartan geometry]], by the sole demand that a certain [[superfield|super-enhancement]] of the pair $(G_4,G_7)$ is a [[Whitehead L-infinity algebra|$\mathfrak{l}S^4$]][[flat L-infinity algebra valued differential form|-cocycle]].

  > Theories of (higher dimensional) [[supergravity]] famously contain ([[higher gauge field|higher]]) [[gauge fields]]. However, traditionally (notably in all [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian formulations]] of [[supergravity]]) these have been discussed only in the case of [[gauge potentials]] given by globally defined [[differential forms]]. In reality, ([[higher gauge field|higher]]) [[gauge fields]] have additional global [[degrees of freedom]] appearing as [[cocycles]] in some [[generalized cohomology theory|generalized]] [[nonabelian differential cohomology]][[cohomology theory|-theory]] and determining the [[torsion subgroup|torsion]] [[charges]] carried by [[small N limit|small numbers]] of [[branes]] sourcing these fields. 

  > I will first recall the general mechanism of *[[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|flux quantization]]* that is needed to specify the complete [[gauge potentials]] of [[higher gauge fields]], together with some "well-known" examples, and then address the case of [[D=11 supergravity]]. Here a miracle occurs: The [[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|flux quantization]] of the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] in [[D=11 supergravity]] naturally exists not just on [[phase space]] but on all of [[spacetime]], in fact on [[super-spacetime]], where the existence of a flux-quantized [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] already implies the full [higher-Maxwell](higher+gauge+field#HigherGaugeTheoryOfMaxwellType)-[[Rarita-Schwinger equation|Rarita-Schwinger]]-[[Einstein equation|Einstein]]-[[equations of motion]].

> The aim of this conference is to discuss [[homotopy type theory|Homotopy Type Theory Theory]] (`HoTT`) as a substrate for [[computing]] and [[software verification|verification]] in software development, in [[synthetic homotopy theory]], and possibly in application to ([[topological quantum computing|topological]]) [[quantum computing]]/[[quantum simulation|simulation]].

> Some talks will focus on recent progress on the general issue of running `HoTT` programs, in view of the [[univalence axiom]]: such as via "[[cubical type theory|cubical TT]]" or the more recent "[[higher observational type theory|higher observational TT]]". Other talks will focus on design patterns for practical ([[quantum programming language|quantum]]) [[programming language|programming]] and [[software verification|certification languages]], notably via [[modal types]] and [[monadic effects]] (in [[modal homotopy type theory|modal extensions of HoTT]]). 

> In this vein, our local speakers will present a point of contact between modal `HoTT` and Quantum: the recently developed "[[linear homotopy type theory|Linear HoTT]]" (`LHoTT`) that equips classical `HoTT` with [[dependent linear type theory|dependent]] "[[linear type theory|linear]]" types which may be thought of as quantum [[data types]]. The `LHoTT` approach to quantum programming interprets a significant [[fragment]] of the [[Proto-Quipper]]-language, now with [[identity types]] enabling full [[software verification|verification]]. 

> The conference is to bring this theoretical progress into contact with efforts to use (`L`)`HoTT` and related languages like [[Proto-Quipper]] for actual ([[quantum computing|quantum]]) [[computing]], [[quantum simulation|simulation]] and [[software verification|verification]].

  > I'll present a subsystem of [[Martin-Löf type theory]] where all [[function type|functions]] from [[natural numbers type|Nat]] to [[natural numbers type|Nat]] are [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. The soundness proof involves a [[Artin gluing|gluing]] construction for a [[sheaf topos]] model constructed from a [[site]] of primitive recursive functions. Then I'll use this as a starting point for some speculations about [[geometric type theory]] and its computational aspects. This is based on joint work with Johannes Schipp von Branitz.

  > [[simplicial type theory|Simplicial type theory]] as [introduced by Riehl and Shulman](simplicial+type+theory#RiehlShulman17) and developed by [[Ulrik Buchholtz|Buchholtz]], Martı́nez, Weinberger, and others enables a [[type theory|type-theoretic]] [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] study of [[(infinity,1)-categories|∞-categories]]. A major absence from the existing results in simplicial type theory is the absence of basic "generating" ∞-categories e.g., the ∞-categories of [[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]]. We present a work-in-progress construction of a type satisfying the properties expected of the ∞-category of ∞-groupoids or, equivalently, the [[universal left fibration]]. We draw on existing work by Weaver and Licata to construct a [[type universe|universe]] of ∞-groupoids within an extension of [[modal homotopy type theory|multimodal HoTT/homotopy MTT]] tooled for synthetic cubical spaces and argue that it lies within the subcategory of (synthetic) simplicial spaces and satisfies the expected properties ([[complete Segal space|Segalness]], [[Rezk completion|Rezkness]], [[directed univalence axiom|directed univalence]]) and is closed under the expected connectives.

  > There are numerous interesting computations in [[cubical type theory]], mostly in relation to [[synthetic homotopy theory]], which are too expensive to perform in existing systems. One way to try to address this is to optimize the involved [[definitions]]. Another way, that I focus on in this talk, is to improve evaluation for the theory itself. I present a recent implementation of a [[cubical type theory|CTT]] with major performance improvements. Broadly speaking, the benefits stem from a) systematically omitting unnecessary computation b) exploiting the [[canonicity]] property of the CTT when computation depends on [[interval]] [[variables]] but not [[free variables]] with [[fibrant types]].

  >  In this talk, we will discuss the formalization of [[cohomology rings]] in [Cubical Agda](Agda#CubicalAgda), and how we computed a few basic examples. We will particularly focus on: 1. How the choice of a [[data type]] representation influence formalisation, in our case for representing [[polynomials]] and [[cohomology rings]] 2. How suitable representations can be used to compute cohomology rings 3. Where computation would be helpful, how it is limited in practice, and how we can still recover some computation to help us with our [[proof]].

  >  In this talk, we discuss a concrete [[categorical semantics]] of [[Proto-Quipper]]-L, a [[quantum circuit]] description language with [[dynamic lifting]]. The language is an extension of [[linear lambda-calculus]] with [[quantum channel]] constants (which represent tree structure of [[quantum gates|gates]]) and [[quantum circuit|circuit]] operations (which are box and unbox) where [[terms]] can have tree shapes. The [[type system]] roughly comes from the [[multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic]] where the term represents the proof. The [[categorical semantics]] of the language is built upon the linear and non-linear model for linear logic [by Benton](linear+type+theory#TheCanonicalCoModality) and coproduct completion as the categorical semantics of [[Proto-Quipper]]-M [by Rios and Selinger](Quipper#RiosSelinger18) while we give a concrete categorical model for diagrams based on graphical calculus. For the computational effect of [[dynamic lifting]] we introduce branching monad and give an interpretation of terms in the [[Kleisli category]].

  >  In this talk, I'll present some ongoing work with [[Anders Mörtberg]] and [[Loïc Pujet]] on the development and computer formalisation of [[cellular homology|cellular homology]] [[cellular cohomology|and cohomology]]. Cellular cohomology was first studied in [[HoTT]] by [[Ulrik Buchholtz|Buchholtz]] and [[Favonia]] who constructed cellular cohomology groups and showed that these define a [[cohomology theory]]. This was done by proving their construction equivalent to the usual construction of cohomology groups via [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]]. I will present an alternative approach to cellular (co)homology (à la Buchholtz & Favonia) using a more traditional framework building on the theory of [[cellular approximations]]. One benefit of this approach is that it works uniformly for [[ordinary homology|homology]] and [[ordinary cohomology|cohomology]]. In particular, I will show you some versions of [[cellular approximation theorems]] we can prove [[constructive mathematics|constructively]] in [[HoTT]] and discuss how these can be used to get [[functor|functorial]] cohomology and homology theories. Another benefit of the approach by cellular approximation is that it makes the definition of the [[cup product]] on cellular cohomology rather direct. If time permits, I will discuss also this construction and whether it can aid in cohomology computations, both in the mathematical sense and in the sense of normalisation in constructive proof assistants like [Cubical Agda](Agda#CubicalAgda).

  > [[cubical type theory|Cubical type theories]] provide computational meaning to [[HoTT]], making it possible to simplify proofs in [[synthetic homotopy theory]] and sometimes even reducing whole arguments purely to computer computations. A classic example is the *Brunerie number* which we recently managed to simplify so that it becomes computable in just a few seconds in [Cubical Agda](Agda#CubicalAgda). I will discuss this and other similar proofs by computation that we have done. I will also discuss various examples of things that we have not managed to compute and work in progress into making Cubical Agda able to compute more things for us.

  cf. [arXiv:2303.02382](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02382)

  > Despite the [evident necessity](topological+quantum+computation#ReferencesNeedForTopologicalProtection) of topological protection for realizing scalable [[quantum computers]], the conceptual underpinnings of [[topological quantum computing|topological quantum]] [[logic gates]] had arguably remained shaky. Building on [[schreiber:Anyonic defect branes in TED-K-theory|recent]] [[schreiber:Anyonic topological order in TED K-theory|results]] on [[defect branes]] in [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]] and on their [[AdS/CMT duality|holographically dual]] [[anyon|anyonic]] defects in [[condensed matter theory]], here we explain how the specification of realistic [[topological quantum computing|topological]] [[quantum gates]], operating by anyon defect [[braiding]] in [[topological order|topologically ordered]] [[quantum materials]], has a surprisingly slick formulation in [[parameterized homotopy theory|parameterized point-set topology]], which is so fundamental that it lends itself to [[software verification|certification]] in modern [[homotopy type theory|homotopically typed]] [[programming languages]] such as [cubical Agda](Agda#CubicalAgda). We propose that this remarkable confluence of concepts may jointly kickstart the development of topological quantum programming proper by providing a powerful paradigm for simulating and verifying topological quantum computing architectures with high-level certification languages aware of the actual physical principles of realistic topological quantum hardware.

  > In this talk, we will present the description of these topological quantum gates in [[homotopy type theory]] and describe the use of [[cubical type theory]] as a [[software verification|certification language]] for [[topological quantum computing]]. We will focus on the definition of the [[configuration space of points|configuration spaces]] in [[cubical type theory]], which play a crucial role in the construction of the space of [[conformal blocks]] as a [[twisted ordinary cohomology|twisted cohomology]] group.

  > Can [[quantum programming languages]] move beyond [[quantum gate|gate-based]] programming? In this talk I will present work in progress where [[quantum algorithms]] (specifically, Clifford unitaries over [[qudits]]) are expressed as functions on compact Pauli encodings. Inspired by the fact that projective Cliffords correspond to center-fixing automorphisms on the Pauli group, we develop a [[type system]] where well-typed expressions correspond to symplectic morphisms---that is, [[linear transformations]] that respect the [[symplectic form]]. This language is backed up by a robust [[categorical semantics|categorical]] and [[operational semantics]], and well-typed functions can be efficiently simulated and synthesized into [[quantum circuit|circuits]]. The resulting [[linear type theory|linear type system]] and semantics is a promising candidate for synthetic mathematical reasoning using [[linear homotopy type theory|linear HoTT]].

  > We seek to verify the [[ZX-calculus]], a powerful tool for representing and reasoning about [[quantum computation]]. ZX-diagrams are typically represented as adjacency-based [[graphs]], reflecting the guiding principle that “only connectivity matters”. In the context of [[proof assistant|formal theorem provers]] like [[Coq]], however, such graphs are difficult to reason about, especially when we seek to give them [[semantics]]. To address this gap, we introduce `VyZX`, a [[software verification|verified]] library for reasoning about the ZX-calculus, using inductive constructs that arise naturally from [[category theory|category theoretic]] definitions. We extend `VyZX` to reason about a variety of [[monoidal categories]], provided they satisfy an appropriate set of [[coherence conditions]].

  > [[higher observational type theory|Higher Observational Type Theory]] is a third style of [[homotopy type theory|Homotopy Type Theory]], contrasting with [[Book HoTT]] and [[cubical type theory|Cubical Type Theory]]. It is characterized by a definition of [[identity types]] by [[recursion]] on the base type: the identity type of a [[product type]] is defined to be a product of identity types, and so on. [[extensional type theory|Extensionality principles]] like [[function extensionality|funext]], [[univalence]], and [[bisimulation]] then hold essentially by definition, rather than only up to [[type equivalence|equivalence]]. Like [[cubical type theory|Cubical Type Theory]], [[higher observational type theory|Higher Observational Type Theory]] can be built by defining a [[fibrant type|fibrancy predicate]] in a non-univalent substrate theory, which in this case is a form of internally parametric type theory. [Altenkirch's talk](#AltenkirchApr2024) describes a [[canonicity]] proof for this substrate; I will sketch a normalization algorithm for it (sans proof), and then demonstrate a prototype implementation of this algorithm. This is joint work in progress with [[Thorsten Altenkirch|Altenkirch]], [[Ambrus Kaposi|Kaposi]], and Uskuplu.

  **Universal Properties of the Boundary Charge**

  > The boundary charge is an interesting observable to characterize [[ground state]] properties of [[topological insulator|insulators]]. Its universal properties and relevance for topology, bulk-boundary correspondence, integer and fractional [[quantum Hall effect]], [[charge quantization]], universal fluctuations, and characterization of [[phase transitions]] is reviewed in this talk. In particular, it is demonstrated that two fundamental invariants characterize the properties of the boundary charge, which are present independent of symmetries, and are the basis for the explanation of the [[quantum Hall effect]] and the rational quantization of boundary and interface charges.

  **Quantum Functionalities of Magnetic Skyrmions**

  > [Magnetic nanoskyrmions](skyrmion#ReferencesInSolidStatePhysics) develop quantized helicity excitations, and the quantum tunneling between nanoskyrmions possessing distinct helicities is indicative of the quantum nature of these particles. Experimental methods capable of non-destructively resolving the quantum aspects of topological spin textures, their local dynamical response, and their functionality now promise practical device architectures for quantum operations. With abilities to measure, engineer, and control matter at the atomic level, nanoskyrmions present opportunities to translate ideas into solid-state technologies. This talk aims to discuss the basic concept of a magnetic skyrmion qubit, its advantages, and challenges in this new research avenue in quantum magnetism and quantum information.

  **Fingerprints of Composite Fermion Lambda Levels in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy**

  > Composite fermion (CF) is a topological quasiparticle that emerges from a non-perturbative attachment of [[vortices]] to electrons in strongly correlated two-dimensional materials. Similar to non-interacting fermions that form Landau levels in a magnetic field, CFs can fill analogous "Lambda'' levels, giving rise to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect of electrons. Here, we show that Lambda levels can be directly visualized through the characteristic peak structure in the signal obtained via spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on a FQH state. Complementary to transport, which probes low-energy properties of CFs, we show that *high-energy* features in STM spectra can be interpreted in terms of Lambda levels. We numerically demonstrate that STM spectra can be accurately modeled using Jain's CF theory. Our results show that STM provides a powerful tool for revealing the anatomy of FQH states and identifying physics beyond the non-interacting CF paradigm.

  **Projective Crystal Symmetry and Novel Topological Phases**

  >  Roughly a decade after the birth of [[quantum mechanics]], [[Eugene Wigner|E. Wigner]] pointed out a fundamental principle of [[quantum mechanics]]: symmetry groups are [[projective representation|projectively represented]]. He applied this principle to study the [[Poincaré group]]. While the [[Poincaré group]] is the unique spacetime group of [[relativistic particles]], its counterpart in [[condensed matter theory|condensed matter]] consists of various [[space groups]] for [[crystals]] and the [[time reversal]]. In this sense, the projective representation of condensed-matter spacetime groups is much richer and of fundamental importance. However, projective crystal symmetry was not systematically investigated until recently. In this talk, I will introduce the general theory of projective crystal symmetry algebras and show some of their novel consequences in topological matter. Particularly, they can lead to $k$-space non-[[symmorphic space group|symmorphic]] symmetries, which can significantly expand the framework of crystalline topological phases.

  **Tensor Network Use Cases: From Quantum Process Tomography to Computational Fluid Dynamics**

  >  In this talk, I will describe two recent applications of [[tensor networks]]. In the first part, I will present an efficient technique for quantum process learning, a quintessential primitive to characterize quantum devices. This combines a tensor network representation of the target [[quantum channel]] with a data-driven optimization inspired by unsupervised [[machine learning]]. These results go far beyond state-of-the-art, providing a practical and timely tool for benchmarking quantum circuits in current and near-term quantum computers. In the second part, in turn, I will briefly describe a recently developed (classical) quantum-inspired algorithm for solving the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] in complex geometries, based on tensor trains. This is a full-stack method to solve for incompressible fluids with memory and runtime scaling poly-logarithmically in the mesh size. Our framework is based on [[matrix product states]] (a.k.a tensor trains), a powerful compressed representation of [[quantum states]]. It is complete in that it solves for flows around immersed objects of arbitrary geometries, with non-trivial boundary conditions, and self-consistent in that it can retrieve the solution directly from the compressed encoding, i.e. without ever passing through the expensive dense-vector representation. This machinery lays the foundations for a new generation of potentially radically more efficient solvers of real-life fluid problems.

  **Robustly Learning the Hamiltonian Dynamics of a Superconducting Quantum Processor**

  > The required precision to perform [[quantum simulations]] beyond the capabilities of classical computers imposes major experimental and theoretical challenges. The key to solving these issues are highly precise ways of characterizing analog quantum simulators. Here, we report on theoretical and experimental work on estimating the free Hamiltonian parameters of bosonic excitations in a [superconducting-qubit](superconductivity#SuperconductingQBitsReferences) analog quantum simulator from measured time-series. We achieve the required levels of precision in estimating the Hamiltonian parameters by maximally exploiting the model structure, making it robust against noise and state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Our learning algorithm is highly scalable both in terms of the required amounts of data and post-processing. To achieve this, we develop a new super-resolution technique for frequency extraction from matrix time-series and make use of constrained manifold optimization for the eigenspace reconstruction. For up to 14 coupled [superconducting qubits](superconductivity#SuperconductingQBitsReferences) on two Sycamore processors, we identify the Hamiltonian parameters - verifying the implementation on one of them up to sub-MHz precision - and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our results constitute a fully characterized, highly accurate implementation of an analog dynamical quantum simulation and introduce a diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.

  **Experimental Routes in Realization of Topological Josephson Junctions**

  > [[Majorana zero modes|Majorana bound states]], which are their own antiparticles, are predicted to emerge as zero-energy modes localized at the boundary between a [[topological superconductor]] and a topologically trivial region. Unlike [[BCS superconductors]], nature has not provided us unambiguous topological superconductors. However, it was realized that by interfacing [[BCS superconductors]] and [[semiconductors]] with strong [[spin-orbit coupling]] it is possible to create a system that can host topological states. Hence epitaxial superconductors and semiconductors have emerged as an attractive materials system with atomically sharp interfaces and broad flexibility in device fabrications incorporating [[Josephson junctions]]. We discuss the basics of topological superconductivity and provide insight on how to go beyond current state-of-the-art experiments. We argue that the ultimate success in realizing Majorana bound state physics relies on the observation of non-trivial fusion and [[braiding]] experiments.

  > [[topological phase of matter|Topological]] [[electron band structure|band theory]] has celebrated various successes over the last few years, such as the recent classifications of crystalline materials based on their [[space group]] symmetry. We are currently witnessing a drive to generalise this theory to the case where interactions between electrons become relevant, with much work focused on [[ground states]]. As an alternative direction, we here study the topology of interaction-induced excitations, specifically excitons in semiconductors. In my talk, I will give a pedagogical introduction to the classification and bulk-boundary correspondence of exciton band structures based on inversion symmetry.

  **From the Homotopy Groups of Real Grassmannians to the Quantum Geometry of Many-Band Systems**

  > I first review the [[homotopy theory|homotopy]] classification of [[electron band structure|band structures]] for [[crystal|crystalline]] systems described by a real Bloch Hamiltonian. These systems, both of fermionic or bosonic types, abound in nature as they merely require the combination of an anti-unitary symmetry (e.g. time reversal) and a twofold unitary symmetry (i.e. inversion, Pi-rotation, or mirror). The relevant [[classifying spaces]], i.e. the real [[Grassmannians]] and the real [[flag manifolds]], exhibit a rich geometric structure leading to a manifold of topological phases in all dimensions. I then introduce a completely general framework, based on the Pluecker imbedding of Grassmannians, to capture the Riemannian geometry of these "real" topological phases, that naturally extends to many-band contexts. While this approach permits the systematic homotopy-based modeling of few-band systems --- greatly facilitating the design of such phases in synthetic matter --- it culminates with the definition of a new $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant capturing the [[Euler class]] of many-band (i.e. beyond rank-2) subspaces.

  **Weyl Points Beyond Band Structures: Classical Mechanics, Spin Qubits, Josephson Junctions**

  > In the past decade, research on [[Weyl semimetals]] has evolved into a major theme within [[condensed-matter physics]]. Defining characteristics of Weyl semimetals are Weyl points, i.e., touching points (a.k.a. degeneracy points or conical intersections) between neighbouring energy bands in the [[electronic band structure]]. Further characteristics of such a Weyl point are its robustness against fluctuations, and the linear energy dispersion in its vicinity. In this talk, I will discuss the simple mathematical origin of the robustness of Weyl points, and illustrate that similar degeneracy points appear in a plethora of physical systems described by parameter-dependent matrices, e.g., in the frequency spectrum of coupled linear oscillators &lbrack;[1](#PalyiMay2024Ref1)&rbrack;, and in the energy spectrum of interacting spin [[qubits]] &lbrack;[2](#PalyiMay2024Ref2),[3](#PalyiMay2024Ref3),[4](#PalyiMay2024Ref4)&rbrack; or [[Josephson junctions]] &lbrack;[5](#PalyiMay2024Ref5),[6](#PalyiMay2024Ref6)&rbrack;. I will also highlight universal patterns describing the creation, annihiliation, merger, and separation of Weyl points as control parameters are varied &lbrack;[6](#PalyiMay2024Ref6),[7](#PalyiMay2024Ref7)&rbrack;. Interestingly, much of this universal behaviour is described by known results from a specific branch of mathematics called singularity theory.

  **Enhancing Non-Classicality Detection with Interventional Data**

  > Generalizations of [[Bell's theorem]], particularly within quantum networks, are now being analyzed through the causal inference lens. However, the exploration of interventions, a central concept in causality theory, remains unexplored. As will be discussed, if we are not limited to observational data and can intervene in our experimental setup, then we can witness quantum violations of classical causal bounds even when no Bell-like violation is possible. That is, through interventions, the quantum behavior of a system that would seem classical otherwise can be demonstrated. We will then present a photonic experiment implementing those ideas and consider applications of this framework for measurement-based quantum computation, quantification of causality in quantum gates and quantum network protocols.

  **Altermagnetism Emerging from Electronic Correlations**

  > While altermagnetic materials are characterized by a vanishing net magnetic moment, their symmetry in principle allows for the existence of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Here we introduce a model with altermagnetism in which the emergence of an AHE is driven by interactions. This model is grounded in a modified Kane-Mele framework with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin correlations. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations show that the system undergoes a finite temperature phase transition governed by a primary AFM order parameter accompanied by a secondary one of Haldane type. The emergence of both orders turns the metallic state of the system, away from half-filling, to an altermagnet with a finite anomalous Hall conductivity. A mean field ansatz corroborates these results, which pave the way into the study of correlation induced altermagnets with finite [[Berry curvature]].

  **Theory of the Quantum Twisting Microscope**

  >  2D van der Waals systems have become a major quantum materials platforn, exhibiting a plethora of correlated electronic phases. Beyond conventional transport experiments, much information on van-der-Waals materials derives from local probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy as well as scanning single-electron-transitor and scanning SQUID measurements. The quantum twisting microscope is a powerful new instrument complementing previously existing local probes. Rather than measuring the local tunneling current at the atomic scale as in scanning tunneling microscopy, it relies on coherent tunneling across a twistable finite-area junction formed at the interface between van der Waals systems placed on a scanning tip with a flat pyramidal top and a substrate. Due to the finite contact area, tunneling is momentum conserving up to reciprocal lattice vectors of the tip and sample layers. In this talk, I discuss the theory of the quantum twisting microscope. While elastic tunneling dominates the tunneling current at small twist angles, the momentum mismatch between the K-points of tip and sample at large twist angles can only be bridged by inelastic scattering. The latter allows for probing collective-mode dispersions along certain lines in reciprocal space by measuring the tunneling current as a function of twist angle and bias voltage. We illustrate this modality of the quantum twisting microscope by developing a systematic theory for measuring phonon dispersions using graphene-graphene junctions. In addition to providing a case study for probing collective modes, our results inform the quest to understand the origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene.

I will discuss how these ideas culminate in the prediction of quantized shift photoconductivities and show that this response may be recast in terms of the integrated torsion tensor and the non-Abelian Berry connection constituting Chern-Simons forms. Physically, I will motivate that the topological quantization emerges purely from virtual transitions contributing to the optical response and discuss possible generalisations.

  **Quantum Critical States in Quasiperiodic Lattices: From Non-Interacting to Correlated**

  >  The disordered quantum systems host three types of fundamental quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical states, of which the multifractal critical states are much less understood compared with the former two. Conventionally the characterization of the quantum critical states relies on arduous numerical verification. In this talk, I will present a systematic analytic and numerical study of the critical states in quasiperiodic systems, with or without particle-particle interactions. Through the Avila global theory, a Fields Medal work which we introduce for the first time to cold atoms, we propose a class of exactly solvable models, dubbed mosaic lattice models, hosting novel types of exact mobility edges separating localized from quantum critical or extended states, With these exactly solvable models, we discover a universal mechanism for the critical states that the such states are due to the vanishing Lyapunov exponent and the incommensurately distributed hopping zeros in the thermodynamic limit, which also serve as a rigorous characterization of the critical states. We further show that in the presence of interactions, the critical states turn into the many-body counterparts upon the finite-size scaling analysis, giving a many-body critical phase, which is an exotic phase in-between the thermal phase and many-body localization. Based on the considerable progresses in spin-orbit coupled optical Raman lattices, which have been widely applied to simulate topological phases, we discuss our latest experimental realization of the present predictions. Future important issues will be commented.

  **Entanglement Diagnosis of Many-Body Systems: Applications to Non-Unitary Conformal Field Theory and Topological Quantum Field Theories**

  > Entanglement measures provide powerful tools for diagnosing quantum many-body phases of matter. In particular, in (1+1)-dimensional systems with conformal symmetry, entanglement entropy exhibits logarithmic scaling, where the coefficient determines the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT). However, in the absence of the unitary condition, the central charge can be negative, leading to negative entanglement entropy. To address this issue, we propose the generalized entanglement entropy to extract the negative central charges in several examples. In addition, in (2+1)-dimensional systems described by topological quantum field theories (TQFT), the sub-leading term of the entanglement entropy is referred to as the topological entanglement entropy (TEE), which contains information about the topological data of the quasiparticles. In this talk, I would like to discuss the TEE for different bipartitions.

  **Unified Framework for Efficiently Computable Quantum Circuits**

  > [[quantum circuits|Quantum circuits]] consisting of Clifford and matchgates are two classes of circuits that are known to be efficiently simulatable on a classical computer. We introduce a unified framework that shows in a transparent way the special structure that allows these circuits can be efficiently simulatable. The approach relies on analyzing the operator spread within a network of basis operators during the evolution of quantum circuit. Quantifying the complexity of a calculation by the number of operators with amplitude above a threshold value, we show that there is a generic form of the complexity curve involving an initial exponential growth, saturation, then exponential decay in the presence of decoherence. Our approach is naturally adaptable into a numerical procedure, where errors can be consistently controlled as a function of the complexity of the simulation.

  **Non-stabilizerness in Quantum Mechanics**

  > We all know that [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] is important in [[quantum mechanics]]. However, quantum behavior needs a second ingredient, the so-called non-stabilizerness property, commonly known as magic. Without it, no quantum computer would be able to outperform a classical one, but not only. Quantum chaos would not ensue, and quantum thermodynamics would not be the same. [[Bell's inequalities]] would not be violated, and [[black holes]] would always be easy to decode. Quantum many-body systems would be boring. Also all the probabilities that come from the Born rule would be trivial. Finally, without non-stabilizerness there would also be no gravity, according to the [[AdS/CFT correspondence|AdS/CFT conjecture]].  All these features are captured by the notion of Stabilizer Entropy (SE), which we will introduce and explain in this talk.

  **Efficient Algorithms for Quantum Magic**

  >  Nonstabilizerness or magic characterizes the resources needed to run fault-tolerant quantum computers and is a necessary condition for quantum advantage. The resource theory of magic quantifies the amount of magic in quantum states, which characterizes the cost of preparing states on quantum computers as well as the runtime of a class of classical simulation algorithms. Here, we provide efficient algorithms to quantify magic on quantum computers &lbrack;1,2&rbrack; and [[matrix product states]] &lbrack;3,4&rbrack;. We use these methods to experimentally study the transition from classically simulable stabilizer states into intractable quantum states, and demonstrate their application for state discrimination and certification. Our work also gives novel insight into the magic of critical many-body quantum systems. We reveal that stabilizer entropy, a measure of nonstabilizerness, is in general not extremal even at the critical point. We show that stabilizer entropies can be used to determine the critical point of the transverse field Ising model, and find evidence of magic becoming long-range close to the critical point. Our works open up the exploration of quantum complexity in many-body quantum systems and quantum computers.

  **Generalization of Quantum Discord**

  > An important aim of quantum information theory is to understand and quantify the various quantum properties and correlations. This is done by constructing measures and in understanding the operational relevance of information theoretic quantities. The best-known measure of nonclassical correlations is quantum discord &lbrack;1,2&rbrack;. In this talk, I will introduce a generalisation of quantum discord to multipartite systems using quantum conditional mutual information &lbrack;3&rbrack;. For the tripartite case, we show that the discord can be decomposed into contributions resulting from changes induced by nonclassical correlation breaking measurements in the conditional mutual information and tripartite mutual information. I will also discuss its relation to bipartite nonclassical correlations and monogamy of nonclassical correlations.

  **Zero Is Not Nothing**

  > The interplay of [[topological phase of matter|topological]] [[electronic band structures]] and strong interparticle interactions provides a promising path toward the constructive design of robust, long-range entangled many-body systems. Most recent theories unveil that non-trivial topology is crucially manifested in the zeros of the fermionic Green’s function in Mott insulating systems and demonstrate the occurrence of topological band structures of zeros, and – by bulk-boundary correspondence – of topological edge states of zeros &lbrack;1&rbrack;. In this talk, I will spend some time reviewing topological Green's function zeros and discussing their physical meaning and potential ways to probe them. I will then spend most of the time presenting an exactly soluble local model Hamiltonian &lbrack;2&rbrack; based on the Toric Code coupled to fermionic degrees of freedom. I'll demonstrate the appearance of Green’s function zeros in a non-trivial, integrable limit of the model and employ controlled perturbation theory to demonstrate their topological band structure. I'll further show that, within this model, Green’s function zeros acquire a finite ''lifetime'' before the Higgs transition, at which they disappear. The local nature of the model allows us to straightforwardly calculate the quantized Hall response.

One of these topological defects is the "duality defect" that implements the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation and is a "non-invertible symmetry" as it projects out states of a given parity. I will highlight the consequence of the duality defect on Floquet time-evolution, first for the exactly solvable Floquet-Ising model, and then by adding integrability breaking perturbations to the model.

  **Optically Dense Atomic Systems: From Pulse Shaping to Atomic Localization via Mangneto Optical Rotation**

  > The quantum control of atomic systems can be achieved through the manipulation of their optical properties, i.e the coherence. In EIT systems, a transparency window is achieved via the interference of two laser beams. In this context, our research investigates shaped laser wave-forms to obtain desirable absorption dispersion spectra, controllable refractive index and induces the atomic population inversion. For instance, q-deformed hyperbolic pulse manipulates the system’s dynamic by adjusting the scaling asymmetry factor q of the q-deformed pulse. In addition, the QEXP pulse opens a transparency window in the absorption spectra. In contrast, in the classical scenario where the laser is non-shaped, we control the optical properties of atomic systems via the SGC: spontaneously generated coherence or the MOR.

  **Experimental Investigation of Geometric Quantum Speed Limits in Open Quantum Systems**

  > The Quantum Speed Limit (QSL) is a fundamental lower bound on the evolution time for quantum systems undergoing general physical processes and may have important consequences for quantum computing. Here, we study the geometric quantum speed limits of a qubit subject to decoherence in an ensemble of chloroform molecules in a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiment.  To do so, we controlled the system-reservoir interaction and the spin relaxation rates by adding a paramagnetic salt, which allowed us to observe both Markovian and non-Markovian open system dynamics for the qubit. We used two distinguishability measures of quantum states to assess the speed of the qubit evolution: the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WY). We observed crossovers between QSLs related to the QFI and WY metrics for non-Markovian dynamics and low salt concentrations. The WY metric sets the tighter QSL for high concentrations and Markovian dynamics. We also show that QSLs are sensitive even to small fluctuations in spin magnetization.

  > The aim of *[[topological data analysis]]* (TDA) is to provide qualitative analysis of large data/parameter sets in a way which is *robust* against uncertainties and noise. This is accomplished using tools and theorems from the mathematical field of *[[algebraic topology]]*. While a tool called *[[persistent homology]]* has become the signature method of TDA, it tends to produce answers that are either hard to interpret (persistent [[cycles]]) or impossible to compute ([[well groups]]). Both problems are solved by a variant method $[$[FK17](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcal17)$]$ which we may call *[[persistent cohomotopy]]*: A first result shows $[$[FKW18](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcalWagner18)$]$ that this new method provides computable answers to the concrete question of detecting whether there exist data+parameters that meet a prescribed target indicator precisely, even in the presence of uncertainty and noise. More generally, efficient data analysis will require further refining [[persistent cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant cohomotopy]] and/or [[twisted cohomotopy]] $[$[[schreiber:Proper Orbifold Cohomology|SS20]]$]$. Curiously, these flavors of [[cohomotopy theory]] have [[Hypothesis H|profound relations]] to formal [[high energy physics]] and [[topological phase of matter|quantum materials]], connecting to which might help to further enhance the power of [[topological data analysis]].

  > Recent advances in magnetism research are likely to have an important impact on electronics and information processing. These advances use the electron magnetic moment (spin) to transmit, write and store information. They enable new devices that operate at high speed with very low energy consumption. The information is stored in the orientation of electron magnetic moments in magnetic materials and can persist without power; energy is only needed to write and read the information. Important physics concepts include the interconversion of electrical (charge) currents into spin currents, the efficiency of the interconversion, controlling the currents, spin polarization direction, and the associated spin torques on magnetic order. [Magnetic skyrmions](skyrmion#ReferencesInSolidStatePhysics) are also of interest both because of their stability --- they are topologically protected objects --- and because their nucleation and motion can be controlled using spin currents. In this talk I will highlight the new physics concepts that have enabled these advances and discuss some of their applications in information processing.

In this colloquium, I will discuss ideas for the noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) and early [[quantum error correction|fault-tolerant]] eras. I will divide my talk into two parts. In the first part, I will make a brief non-technical introduction to the field, its relevance to the UAE, and the main lines of research of the [Quantum Algorithms](https://www.tii.ae/quantum/our-research/quantum-algorithms) division at [QRC](https://www.tii.ae/quantum)-[TII](https://www.tii.ae/).

This provides a versatile toolbox for both error-mitigation and circuit boosts useful for NISQ computations. Then, I will move on to algorithms for the forthcoming quantum hardware of the early fault-tolerant era: I will present a new generation of high-precision algorithms for [simulating quantum imaginary-time evolution](repeat-until-success+computing#AolitaEtAl21) (QITE) that are significantly simpler than current schemes based on quantum amplitude amplification (QAA).

  **Demonstration of Quantum Energy Teleportation by Superconducting Quantum Processors and Implications for Communications and High Energy Physics**

  > Quantum energy teleportation is a theoretical concept in [[quantum physics]] that describes the transfer of [[energy]] from one location to another without the need for a physical medium to carry it. This is made possible by means of universal properties of [[quantum entanglement]] and measurement of quantum states. The role of QET in physics and information engineering is largely unexplored, as the theory has not received much attention for long time since it was proposed about 15 years ago. To validate it on a real quantum processor, my research has tested the energy teleportation protocol in its most visible form for the first time on IBM's [superconducting quantum](superconductivity#SuperconductingQBitsReferences) computer. In my colloquium talk, I will explain the historical background of quantum energy teleportation, quantum circuits and quantum operations. Moreover I will present a concrete setup for a long-distance and large-scale quantum energy teleportation with real [[quantum networks]].

  > In addition, I will present the results of [[quantum simulations]] with relativistic field theory as a study based on the high-energy physics perspective and the [[symmetry protected topological phase|symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of matter]] of quantum energy teleportation. The models will describe include the two dimensional QED (the massive Thirring model), the AKLT model, the [[Haldane model]], and the Kitaev model. Those results show that the phase diagrams of the field theory and SPT phase are closely related to energy teleportation.

  > In summary my talk will provide a novel suggestion that quantum energy teleportation paves a new pathway to a link between quantum communication on real [[quantum network]], phase diagram of quantum many-body system, and quantum computation.

  > [[quantum physics|Quantum]] technology is a rapidly advancing field that is poised to revolutionize numerous industries, including [[quantum computing|computing]], communications, [[quantum sensing|sensing]], and [[cryptography]]. At its core, quantum technology relies on the principles of [[quantum mechanics]], which allow for the creation of devices that operate on the quantum level. These devices based on quantum technology can perform tasks that are impossible or prohibitively difficult for [[classical physics|classical]] devices. One of the most promising applications of quantum technology is in [[quantum computing]], quantum communications, and [[quantum sensors]].

  > [[trapped ion|Trapped ions]] are one of the promising platform for [[quantum computing]] and [[quantum sensing|sensing]]. In this approach, individual ions are trapped in a vacuum chamber using [[electromagnetic fields]] and manipulated using [[lasers]] to perform quantum operations. As a quantum system, [[trapped ions]] offer several advantages. First, they have long coherence times, meaning that the quantum state of the ion can be preserved for a longer period, allowing for more complex calculations. Second, [[trapped ions]] can be precisely controlled and manipulated, allowing for the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates. Finally, [[trapped ions]] can be entangled with one another, allowing for the implementation of quantum algorithms that are impossible to simulate on classical computers. Trapped ions also have great potential as [[quantum sensors]]. By using the properties of the ions to measure changes in their environment, trapped ions can detect minute changes in [[temperature]], [[magnetic fields]], and [[electric fields]], among other things. This makes them useful for applications in precision measurement, such as in atomic clocks, [[gravitational wave]] detection, and magnetometry.

  > One of the major challenges facing trapped ion systems is scalability. While individual ions have been used to perform simple quantum algorithms, scaling the system up to include a large number of ions is a difficult task. However, recent advances in ion trap technology have made it possible to trap larger numbers of ions and transport them in 2D and 3D space to perform more complex operations for quantum computation and sensing experiments. Realization of such devices is not far away. As compared to present atomic clocks, a new generation of quantum-enhanced clocks is now emerging showing significantly improved accuracy. Sensitive physical measurements are an essential component of modern science and technology. Developments in [[quantum sensors]] will outdate their classical counterparts.

  > Every two-dimensional [[topological phase]] is associated with some [[topological quantum field theory]] (TQFT), or [more formally](modular+tensor+category#AnyonicTopologicalOrderInTermsOfBraidedFusionCategoriesReferences) a [[modular tensor category]].  The [[ground states]] of a [[topological phase]] [encode information](topological+entanglement+entropy+--+references#CharacterizingTopologicalOrder) about the TQFT, which makes them useful in determining the TQFT data, such as [[anyon]] mutual statistics and self statistics.  For example, many numerical methods for detecting the TQFT [relied on](topological+entanglement+entropy+--+references#CharacterizingTopologicalOrder) the use of minimum entanglement states (MESs), which are the eigenstates of the [[Wilson loop]] operators, and are labeled by the anyons corresponding to their eigenvalues.  Here we revisit the definition of the Wilson loop operators and MESs.  We rederive the [[modular transformation]] of the [[ground states]] purely from the Wilson loop algebra, and as a result, the modular $S$- and $T$-matrices naturally show up in the overlap of MESs.  Importantly, we show that due to the phase degree of freedom of the Wilson loop operators, the MES-anyon assignment is not unique.  This ambiguity means that there are some sets of TQFTs that cannot be distinguished from one another solely by the overlap of MESs.

  **High-fidelity universal quantum computation with symmetric qubit clusters**

  > Designing a physical device that maintains the error rate for each quantum processing operation low is one of the most arduous issues for the implementation of a scalable [[quantum computer]]. These errors may result from inaccurate quantum manipulation, such as a gate voltage sweeping in [[solid-state physics|solid-state]] [[qubits]] or a [[laser]] pulse duration. [[decoherence|Decoherence]] is usually a manifestation of the interaction with the environment, and it is an entity of the [[quantum system]] which generates errors. Small clusters of [[qubits]] with symmetries can be used to shield part of them from [[decoherence]]. We encode pairs of connected qubits and universal 2-qubit [[quantum gates|logical gates]] using 4-level cores with omega-rotation invariance. We show that symmetry renders logical operations particularly resistant to anisotropic qubit rotations that models some quantum errors. We suggest a scalable method for universal quantum processing in which cores act as quansistors, or quantum transistors. By adjusting their intrinsic variables, quansistors may be dynamically isolated from their environment, providing them the adaptability needed to function as controlled [[quantum memory]] units.

  > Given that reliable cloud [[quantum computers]] are becoming closer to reality, the concept of delegation of [[quantum computations]] and its [[software verification|verifiability]] is of central interest. Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted, off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input. In the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of the computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic verification device, all in a single round.  In this talk, we will show how the delegation of quantum computations can be achieved in the OTS model, and furthermore how to make this protocol zero-knowledge. The emphasis will be on the concepts that contribute to this result; these concepts are drawn from a long line of research related to blind and delegated quantum computation, as well as quantum zero-knowledge proofs.

In this talk I will describe two recent sets of experiments from our group where we are able to extend the coherence times of the central spin by engineering these spin-bath interactions. First, I show how the coherence times of phosphorus donors in silicon are influenced by low-power above-bandgap optical excitation.  Next, I describe the use of dynamical decoupling techniques to suppress NV-P1 interactions in diamond.

In this work, we propose a quantum approach to defining topological kernels that is based on constructing Betti curves, i.e. topological fingerprint of [[filtered object|filtrations]] with increasing order.

  > Let $C$ be a [[quantum circuit]] and let $G$ be a set of [[quantum gates]]. A *catalytic embedding* of $C$ over $G$ is a pair $(D,v)$ consisting of a [[quantum state|state]] $v$ and a [[quantum circuit|circuit]] $D$ over $G$ such that for every state $u$ we have $D(u \otimes v) = (C u) \otimes v$. Because the state $v$ is left unchanged by the application of $D$, it is known as a *catalyst*. Catalytic embeddings are useful when the circuit $C$ cannot be exactly represented over the gate set $G$. In such cases, one can leverage the catalyst to implement (any number of occurrences of) $C$ using circuits over $G$.

  > In this talk, I will present the theory of catalytic embeddings and discuss applications to the exact and approximate synthesis of quantum circuits.

An information theoretic investigation of quantum coherence was initiated in [1] from a resource theory perspective. In this talk, I will provide an outline of quantifying coherence, the two different forms corresponding to it namely the intrinsic coherence and local coherence, and trade-off relation between these two types of coherence [2]. As an application, I will talk about the role of quantum coherence in the study of quantum synchronization. First, I will give an overview of synchronization. Then considering an [[open quantum system]] comprising of a two-level system interacting with an external environment, I will show how it exhibits phase preference in the long-time limit. While this phase preference, which we identify as quantum phase localization, shows features like Arnold tongue, which is considered as an identifier for quantum synchronization, I present evidence to show that it is not quantum synchronization [3]. Finally, I will discuss the challenges remaining to be addressed in connecting these two related phenomena of quantum phase localization and quantum synchronization.

Here we propose a spinor [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We generalize the Kibble-Zurek mechanism to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.

This makes it a powerful tool for materials science, biomedical, and quantum technology applications. However, these techniques suffer from an inherent low signal sensitivity. A hyperpolarization method known as Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) enhances the sensitivity of NMR and MRI by transferring polarization from electron spins to nuclear spins. The traditional DNP methods face challenges in efficiently polarizing systems with broad Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) lines. To overcome this limitation, Integrated Solid Effect (ISE) DNP is widely used for improved polarization transfer efficiency. Despite its broad application, the role of quantum coherences in ISE DNP remains poorly understood. The quantum coherences generated during electron-nucleus Double-Quantum (DQ) and Zero-Quantum (ZQ) transitions are crucial for maximizing DNP efficiency. Using density matrix formalism, we provide a detailed analysis of quantum coherences in the ZQ and DQ subspaces, as well as the electron's Single-Quantum (SQ) basis, revealing their impact on ISE DNP. Our findings offer new insights into utilizing room-temperature hyperpolarization in biomedical applications.

It becomes an important tool to study the [[quantum many-body physics|quantum many-body system]] out of equilibrium. To put the Yang-Baxter gate on the [[quantum computer]], it has to be decomposed into the native gates of quantum computers. It is favorable to apply the least number of native two-qubit gates to construct the Yang-Baxter gate. We study the geometric representations of all $X$-type braid gates and their corresponding Yang-Baxter gates via the Yang-Baxterization. We find that the braid and Yang-Baxter gates can only exist on certain edges and faces of the two-qubit tetrahedron. We identify the parameters by which the braid and Yang-Baxter gates are the Clifford gate, the matchgate, and the dual-unitary gate. The geometric representations provide the optimal decompositions of the braid and Yang-Baxter gates in terms of other two-qubit gates. We also find that the entangling powers of the Yang-Baxter gates are determined by the spectral parameters. Our results provide the necessary conditions to construct the braid and Yang-Baxter gates on quantum computers.

  > One of the first interesting [[braid group representation|representations of]] the [[braid groups]] is the [[Burau representation]]. It is the first of the family of Lawrence representations, defined topologically by viewing the braid group as the [[mapping class group]] of a punctured disc. Famously, the Burau representation is almost never faithful, but the $k = 2$ Lawrence representation is always faithful: this is a celebrated theorem of Bigelow and Krammer and implies immediately that braid groups are linear (act faithfully on finite-dimensional vector spaces). Motivated by this, and by the open question of whether mapping class groups are linear, I will describe [recent joint work with Christian Blanchet and Awais Shaukat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00515) in which we construct analogues of the  awrence representations for mapping class groups of compact, orientable surfaces. Tools include twisted Borel-Moore homology of con guration spaces, Schr&ouml;dinger representations of discrete Heisenberg groups and the Stone-von Neumann theorem.

  > [[differential cohomology|Differential generalized cohomologies]] refine generalized cohomologies on manifolds so as to retain information on differential forms. The aim of my talk is to describe formulations of [[differential K-theory|differential]] [[KO-theory]] based on gradations and [[mass terms]]. The formulation based on mass terms is motivated by a conjecture of Freed and Hopkins about a classification of [[invertible quantum field theories]] and by a model of the [[Anderson dual]] of [[cobordism cohomology|cobordism theory]] given by Yamashita and Yonekura. I will start with an account of this background, and then describe the formulation of [[differential K-theory|differential]] [[KO-theory]]. In the formulation a key role is played by a uperconnection associated to a mass term. This is a joint work with [[Mayuko Yamashita]].

When a group (or groupoid) satisfies this conjecture we present how we can compute the topological K-theory of $C_r^*(G)$ via a classifying space.

  **Equivariant twisted KK-theory of noncompact Lie groups**

Motivated by this, we will present results on the [[twisted equivariant K-theory|equivariant twisted]] [[KK-theory]] of a noncompact semisimple Lie group $G$. We will give a geometric description of generators of the equivariant twisted KK-theory of G with equivariant correspondences, which are applied to formulate the geometric quantization of quasi-Hamiltonian manifolds with proper G-actions. We will also show that the Baum-Connes [[assembly map]] for the $C^\ast$-algebra of sections of the Dixmier-Douady bundle which realizes the twist is an isomorphism, and discuss a conjecture on representations of the loop group $L G$.

It is constructed as an object both reflecting the geometric nature of [[elliptic curves]] and more practicable to study than most [[elliptic cohomology|elliptic cohomology theories]]. It can be interpreted by [[Huan's inertia orbifold|orbifold loop spaces]] and expressed in terms of [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant K-theories]]. We formulate the complete [[nLab:power operation]] of this theory. Applying that we prove the finite subgroups of the [[Tate curve]] can be classified by the Tate K-theory of [[symmetric groups]] modulo a certain transfer ideal. In this talk we construct twisted Real quasi-elliptic cohomology as the [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[KR-theory]] of [[free loop  orbifold|loop groupoids]]. The theory systematically incorporates loop rotation and reflection. After establishing basic properties of the theory, we construct Real analogues of the string power operation of quasi-elliptic cohomology. We also explore the relation of the theory to the Tate curve. This is joint work with [[Matthew Young]]. &lbrack;[arXiv:2210.07511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07511)&rbrack;

  > Both [[higher structures]] and [[bundle gerbe modules]] play important roles in modern [[geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]]. [[bundle gerbe module|Bundle gerbe modules]] is a [[twisted vector bundle|twisted version]] of [[vector bundles]], and was introduced by Bouwknegt-Carey-Mathai-Murray-Stevenson in 2002. In particular, they introduced the [[twisted Chern character]] from the perspective of [[Chern-Weil theory]]. In a recent joint work with Han and Mathai, we study the [[homotopy theory]] aspects of the twisted Chern classes of torsion bundle gerbe modules. Using Sullivan's [[rational homotopy theory]], we realize the twisted Chern classes at the level of [[classifying spaces]]. The construction suggests a notion, which we call fractional U-structure serving as a universal framework to study the twisted Chern classes of torsion bundle gerbe modules from the perspective of classifying spaces. Based on this, we introduce and study higher fractional structures on torsion bundle gerbe modules parallel to the higher structures on ordinary vector bundles.

  > [[moduli space of flat connections|Moduli spaces of flat principal bundles]] on [[surfaces]] are a prominent object in [[mathematical physics]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[geometric representation theory]]. In particular they are the [[phase space]] of 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] on a surface times an interval and hence equipped with a [[symplectic structure]] going back to the work of [[Atiyah]] and [[Bott]]. Various [[deformation quantizations]] of the [[algebra of functions]] have been constructed. Ben-Zvi, Brochier & Jordan constructed "local to global" quantizations using [[factorization homology]] of representation categories of [[quantum groups]]. Local to global constructions in this setting only work if the [[higher geometry|higher geometric]] [[higher structure|structure]] of the moduli space of flat bundles is taken into account, i.e. it is treated as a [[moduli stack]]. In this setting the algebra of functions does not contain all the information and should be replaced by the category of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].

  > In my talk we will explore [[categorifications]] of deformation quantization as deformations of [[symmetric monoidal categories]] (algebras over the [[E-infinity operad|$E_\infty$-operad]]) into $E_i$-categories and their interplay with factorization homology. The main result is that 2-dimensional factorization homology "commutes" with [[quantization]] in a way relating $E_0$-quantizations to braided ($E_2$) quantizations. We will illustrate our results with examples from [[Poisson geometry]] and [[quantum groups]]. As a specific application we show that deformation quantizations of the moduli space of flat bundles based on Kontsevich integrals constructed by Li, Bland & Ševera are equivalent to quantizations constructed by Alekseev, Grosse & Schomerus based on quantum groups.

For spaces and twists equipped with an [[group action|action]] by a [[group]], [[equivariant twisted K-theory]] provides an even finer invariant. Equivariant twists over [[Lie groups]] gained increasing importance in the subject due to a [[Loop Groups and Twisted K-Theory|result by Freed, Hopkins and Teleman]] that relates the corresponding K-groups to the [[Verlinde ring]] of the associated [[loop group]]. From the point of view of [[homotopy theory]] only a small [[subgroup]] of all possible twists is considered in classical treatments of [[twisted K-theory]]. In this talk I will discuss an operator-algebraic model for equivariant higher (i.e. non-classical) twists over $SU(n)$ induced by exponential functors on the category of vector spaces and isomorphisms. These twists are represented by [[Fell bundles]] and the [[C*-algebra|C*-algebraic]] picture allows a full computation of the associated K-groups at least in low dimensions.

Moreover, for the Standard Mode alone, the invertible B−L symmetry [[conserved charge|current]] conservation can be violated quantum mechanically by gravitational backgrounds such as gravitational instantons, hypothetically pertinent for [[leptogenesis]] in the very early [[observable universe|universe]]. In specific, we show that a [[generalized global symmetry|noninvertible categorical]] counterpart of the B−L symmetry still survives in gravitational backgrounds.

This extra data is important for axiomatizing [[functional analysis]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum information theory]]...

  > I will begin by explaining the construction of a [[category]] $CofCos$, whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]] [[cospans]]. Here the [[identity morphism|identity]] [[cospan]] is chosen to be of the form $X\to X\times [0,1]\rightarrow X$, in contrast with the usual identity in the [[bicategory]] $Cosp(V)$ of cospans over a category $V$. The category $CofCos$ has a [[subcategory]] $HomCob$ in which all spaces are homotopically 1-finitely generated. There exist [[functors]] into $HomCob$ from a number of categorical constructions which are potentially of use for modelling [[particle]] [[trajectories]] in [[topological phases of matter]]: embedded cobordism categories and [motion groupoids](motion+groupoid#TorzewskaMartinsMartin23) for example. Thus, functors from $HomCob$ into [[Vect]] give [[linear representation|representations]] of the aforementioned categories. I will also construct a family of [[functors]] $Z_G\colon HomCob\to Vect$, one for each [[finite group]] $G$, and show that [[topological quantum field theories]] previously constructed [[Yetter model|by Yetter]], and an untwisted version of [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory|Dijkgraaf-Witten]], generalise to functors from $HomCob$. I will construct this functor in such a way that it is clear the [[images]] are [[finite dimensional vector spaces]], and the functor is explicitly calculable. I will also give example calculations throughout.

The homotopy weakening of algebraic properties afforded by [[Lie n-algebra|Lie $L_n$-algebras]] is tied to violation of geometric higher-[[Bianchi identity|Bianchi conditions]]. In this talk, I will focus on the application of this observation to two specific cases, and examine its consequences. First, for the [[monopole]] [[circle group|$U(1)$]] gauge theory, the above observation gives rise to the [[2-group]] [[Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation]] ([Benini-Cordova-Intriligator 2019](Green-Schwarz+mechanism#BeniniCordovaHsin19)), and the associated dipole conservation laws exhibit mobility restriction akin to fractonic matter (Slagel-Kim 2017). Second, for the [[string 2-group|string 2-gauge]] theory, we find a [[3-group]] worth of charges exhibiting novel and intricate mobility restrictions and, under certain assumptions, the resulting 3-gauge theory achieves a higher-monopole charge which matched the [[first fractional Pontrjagin class|fractional Pontrjagyn class]] $\tfrac{1}{2}p_1$. This gives a way in which the [[string structure]] of a [[spin manifold]] $X$ can be probed dynamically by a 3-group gauge theory.

  > Every [[bundle]] on a [[manifold]] has a universal [[symmetry group]] which controls all [[equivariance|equivariant]] [[structures]] on the bundle. We modify this idea in two ways: we consider the [[infinitesimal]] version of universal symmetries and allow [[higher structure|higher]], or [[categorification|categorified]] bundles. These appear, for instance, in [[supergravity]], and [[higher gauge theory]], and more generally in [[geometry]] and [[topology]]. We will use a family-version of the [Lurie-Pridham Theorem](formal+moduli+problem#RelationToLInfinityAlgebras) of [[derived geometry|derived]] [[deformation theory]] to construct these higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We then use this to provide a unified definition of [[connection on a smooth principal infinity-bundle|connections on higher bundles]] and an algebraic formulation of [[differential cohomology]]. This extends work by [[John Baez|Baez]], [[Urs Schreiber|Schreiber]], [[Konrad Waldorf|Waldorf]], [[Mikhail Kapranov|Kapranov]] and others.

  > In our talk, we shall dive into a number of phenomena related to the [[homotopy limit|higher limit]] approach to the description of [[functors]] of [[homological algebra|homological]] nature. The first examples appeared in the work of [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]] on [[Hochschild homology]] of algebras, where he showed that Hochschild homology of an algebra can be represented as limits of some functors from the category of free [[algebra extension|extensions]] of a given algebra. Further similar formulas [were derived](fr-code#IvanovMikhailov15) by [[Roman Mikhailov]] and [[Sergey Ivanov]] in the context of [[group homology]], who showed that group homology of a group can be expressed as higher limits of certain functors along the category of free extensions of the group. They further proposed the construction of [[fr-language]], where $\mathbf{f}$ and $\mathbf{r}$ are some functorial [[ideals]] of the functor of [[group rings]]. It allows us to describe lots of graded functors from the category of groups to the category of abelian groups by simple expressions of the form $\mathbf{f}\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}\mathbf{f}$, $\mathbf{r}\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{f}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{f}$.
