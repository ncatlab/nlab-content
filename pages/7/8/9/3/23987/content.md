    **Persistent homotopy groups of metric spaces**

    > By capturing both geometric and topological features of datasets, [[persistent homology]] has shown its promise in applications. Motivated by the fact that [[homotopy]] in general contains more information than [[homology]], we study notions of [[persistent homotopy]] groups of compact [[metric spaces]], together with their stability properties in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Under fairly mild assumptions on the spaces, we proved that the classical [[fundamental group]] has an underlying tree-like structure (i.e. a dendrogram) and an associated ultrametric. We then exhibit pairs of filtrations that are confounded by [[persistent homology]] but are distinguished by their [[persistent homotopy]] groups. We finally describe the notion of persistent [[rational homotopy theory|rational]] homotopy groups, which is easier to handle but still contains extra information compared to persistent homology.

    **Realisations of Posets**

    > My presentation  is based on an article with the same title coauthored with A. Jin and F. Tombari  ([arXiv:2112.12209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12209)).

    > Encoding information in form of  [[functors]] indexed by the [[poset]] of $r$-tuples of real numbers ([[persistence modules]]) is attractive for three reasons: 
       
    > a) metric properties  of the poset are essential  to study  distances on persistence modules

    > b) the poset of $r$-tuples of real numbers has well behaved discrete  approximations which are  used  to provide finite  approximations of  persistence modules 
       
    > c) the mentioned discretizations and approximations  have well studied algebraic and homological properties as they can be identified with  multi graded modules over polynomial rings.

    > In my talk I will describe a construction called realisation, that transforms arbitrary posets into posets  which satisfy all three requirements above and hence  are particularly suitable for persistence methods.Intuitively the realisation associates a continuous structure to a locally discrete poset by filling in empty spaces. For example the realisation of the poset of natural numbers is the poset of non-negative reals. I will focus on illustrating how [[homological algebra|homological techniques]], such as [[Koszul complexes]], can be used to study [[persistence modules]] indexed by realisations.

    **Thoughts on big data sets**


    > This talk describes work in progress. The idea is to develop methods for analyzing a very large data sets $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ in high dimensional spaces. There are well-known pitfalls to avoid, including the inability to computationally analyze [[TDA]] constructions for $X$ on account of its size, the "curse of high dimensionality", and the failure of [[excision]] for standard [[TDA]] constructions. We discuss the curse of high dimensionality and define a hypercube metric on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that may lessen its effects. The excision problem for the [[Vietoris-Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips construction]] can be addressed by expanding the [[TDA]] discussion to [[filtered object|filtered]] subobjects $K$ of Vietoris-Rips constructions. Unions of such subobjects satisfy excision in path components (clusters) and [[homology groups]], by classical results. The near-term goal is to construct, for each data point $x$, a "computable" filtered subcomplex $K_{x} \subset V(X)$ with $x \in K_{x}$, which would capture spatial local behaviour of the data set $X$ near $x$. A large (but highly parallelizable) algorithm finds a nearest neighbour, or a set of $k$-nearest neighbours for a fixed data point $x \in X$. Some variant of this algorithm may lead to a good construction of the local subcomplex $K_{x}$.

  > In this series of three talks we will explain the foam approach to [[link homology]]. Bigraded link homology theories [[categorification|categorify]] the [[Jones polynomial]] and other [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction|Reshetikhin-Turaev]] [[link invariants]], such as the [[HOMFLY-PT polynomial]]. Foams, which are [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] 2D [[cell complex|complexes]] embedded in [[Euclidean space|3-space]] allow to construct state spaces for [[planar graphs]] which are then used to define link homology groups. The most explicit and efficient way to define graph state spaces is via evaluation of the closed foams (Robert-Wagner formula).

  > A) This formula will be first explained in the less technical unoriented $SL(3)$ case. Resulting graph state spaces are then related to the Four-Color Theorem and Kronheimer-Mrowka homology for 3-[[orbifolds]].

  > B) A step in that construction requires building a topological theory (a lax TQFT) from an evaluation of closed objects, such as closed $n$-manifolds. We will explain the setup for topological theories, including in two dimensions, recovering the Deligne categories and their generalizations. In one dimension and adding defects, these topological theories are related to noncommutative power series, pseudocharacters, and, over the Boolean semiring, to [[regular languages]] and [[automata]].

  > C) Robert-Wagner $GL(N)$ foam evaluation and its application to constructing link homology theories will be explained as well.

  > [[quantum field theory|Quantum field theories]] can have an inconsistency called an [[quantum anomaly|anomaly]], formulated as an [[invertible field theory]] in one dimension higher. Theorems of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman and [Freed-Hopkins](invertible+field+theory#FreedHopkins21) classify [[invertible field theories]] in terms of [[bordism groups]]. In this talk, I'll apply this to the low-energy approximation of $E_8 \times E_8$ [[heterotic string theory]]; Witten proved anomaly cancellation in a restricted setting, but we perform a twisted string bordism computation to show that the relevant group of 11-dimensional [[invertible field theories]] does not vanish, and therefore there could be an anomaly in $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory. Standard computational techniques for twisted [[string bordism]] do not work for this problem; I will also discuss work joint with Matthew Yu using Baker-Lazarev's R-module Adams spectral sequence to simplify a large class of twisted spin and string bordism computations.

The mathematical model of this theory as a [[topological field theory]] was introduced by [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction|Reshetikhin and Turaev]] and is at the core of modern [[quantum topology]].

One of the central axioms is a certain local constancy condition, called the [[time-slice axiom]], that encodes a concept of time evolution. Using [[model category|model categorical]] [[localization of model categories|localization]] techniques, I will show that this i.g. [[homotopy]]-[[coherence|coherent]] time evolution admits a [[rectification|strictification]] in many relevant cases.

This new class of links, which share many [[Khovanov homology|homological properties]] with alternating links, is defined in a recursive way which is not easy to use in order to determine whether a given link is quasi-alternating. In this talk, we shall review the main obstruction criteria for quasi-alternating links. We also discuss how new examples of quasi-alternating links can constructed.

  > Since the mid 1980s, there have been hints of a deep connection between 2-dimensional [[quantum field theory|field theories]] and [[elliptic cohomology]]. This lead to Stolz and Teichner's conjectured geometric model for the universal elliptic cohomology theory of [[topological modular forms]] ([[TMF]]) in which [[cocycles]] are [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory|2-dimensional supersymmetric field theories]]. Basic properties of these field theories lead to expected integrality and modularity properties, but the abundant [[torsion subgroup|torsion]] in [[TMF]] has always been mysterious. In this talk, I will describe deformation invariants of 2-dimensional field theories that realize certain torsion classes in TMF. This leads to a description of the generator of [[tmf#HomotopyGroups|$\pi_3(TMF) =\mathbb{Z}/24$]] in terms of the [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory|supersymmetric sigma model]] with [[target space|target]] [[3-sphere|$S^3$]].

Weight systems can be used to recover invariants for the relevant kind of knotted object (eg. [[knots]], [[links]], [[braids]] etc.) from the [[Kontsevich integral]]. The [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|work of Sati and Schreiber]] highlighted the connection between ([[horizontal chord diagram|horizontal]]) chord diagrams and higher observables in quantum [[brane]] physics. This motivates the question: "which weight systems are quantum states?" [[schreiber:Fundamental weight systems are quantum states|Corfield, Sati and Schreiber showed]] that all $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ [[weight systems]] associated to the [[fundamental representation|defining representation]] are indeed [[state on a star-algebra|quantum states]]. In this talk I will present an extension of their result to more general weight systems.

As a consequence of the absence of [[global symmetries]] in [[quantum gravity|QG]], [one such conjecture](swampland#SwamplandCobordismConjecture) is saying that the [[cobordism group]] has to vanish. In mathematics very often these groups do not vanish right away. Physics tells us that this can be ameliorated by either [[gauge symmetry|gauging]] or [[symmetry breaking|breaking]] of the corresponding global symmetries.

  > First, we show how the gauging fits into some known constraints in [[string theory]], the so-called [[tadpole cancellation]] conditions. Mathematically, this is reflecting a well known connection between certain [[topological K-theory|K-theory]] and [[cobordism groups]]. Second, we report on new results related to the breaking of a global symmetry via [[codimension]] one [[defect QFT|defects]]. In fact, going beyond topology a very similar mechanism arises for (for a long time puzzling) rolling solutions in string theory, giving rise to the notion of a dynamical cobordism conjecture.

  > The aim of *[[topological data analysis]]* (TDA) is to provide qualitative analysis of large data/parameter sets in a way which is *robust* against uncertainties and noise. This is accomplished using tools and theorems from the mathematical field of *[[algebraic topology]]*. While a tool called *[[persistent homology]]* has become the signature method of TDA, it tends to produce answers that are either hard to interpret (persistent [[cycles]]) or impossible to compute ([[well groups]]). Both problems are solved by a variant method $[$[FK17](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcal17)$]$ which we may call *[[persistent cohomotopy]]*: A first result shows $[$[FKW18](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcalWagner18)$]$ that this new method provides computable answers to the concrete question of detecting whether there exist data+parameters that meet a prescribed target indicator precisely, even in the presence of uncertainty and noise. More generally, efficient data analysis will require further refining [[persistent cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant cohomotopy]] and/or [[twisted cohomotopy]] $[$[[schreiber:Proper Orbifold Cohomology|SS20]]$]$. Curiously, these flavors of [[cohomotopy theory]] have [[Hypothesis H|profound relations]] to formal [[high energy physics]] and [[topological phase of matter|quantum materials]], connecting to which might help to further enhance the power of [[topological data analysis]].

  > Recent advances in magnetism research are likely to have an important impact on electronics and information processing. These advances use the electron magnetic moment (spin) to transmit, write and store information. They enable new devices that operate at high speed with very low energy consumption. The information is stored in the orientation of electron magnetic moments in magnetic materials and can persist without power; energy is only needed to write and read the information. Important physics concepts include the interconversion of electrical (charge) currents into spin currents, the efficiency of the interconversion, controlling the currents, spin polarization direction, and the associated spin torques on magnetic order. [Magnetic skyrmions](skyrmion#ReferencesInSolidStatePhysics) are also of interest both because of their stability --- they are topologically protected objects --- and because their nucleation and motion can be controlled using spin currents. In this talk I will highlight the new physics concepts that have enabled these advances and discuss some of their applications in information processing.

  > Reaching long-term maturity in [[quantum computation]] science and technology relies on the field delivering practically useful application in a short term. In this colloquium, I will discuss ideas for the noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) and early [[quantum error correction|fault-tolerant]] eras. I will divide my talk into two parts. In the first part, I will make a brief non-technical introduction to the field, its relevance to the UAE, and the main lines of research of the [Quantum Algorithms](https://www.tii.ae/quantum/our-research/quantum-algorithms) division at [QRC](https://www.tii.ae/quantum)-[TII](https://www.tii.ae/).

In particular, I will first present a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to simulate high-connectivity quantum circuits from low-connectivity ones. This provides a versatile toolbox for both error-mitigation and circuit boosts useful for NISQ computations. Then, I will move on to algorithms for the forthcoming quantum hardware of the early fault-tolerant era: I will present a new generation of high-precision algorithms for [simulating quantum imaginary-time evolution](repeat-until-success+computing#AolitaEtAl21) (QITE) that are significantly simpler than current schemes based on quantum amplitude amplification (QAA). QITE is central not only to ground-state optimisations but also to partition-function estimation and Gibbs-state sampling, with a plethora of computational applications.

  **Demonstration of Quantum Energy Teleportation by Superconducting Quantum Processors and Implications for Communications and High Energy Physics**

  > Quantum energy teleportation is a theoretical concept in [[quantum physics]] that describes the transfer of [[energy]] from one location to another without the need for a physical medium to carry it. This is made possible by means of universal properties of [[quantum entanglement]] and measurement of quantum states. The role of QET in physics and information engineering is largely unexplored, as the theory has not received much attention for long time since it was proposed about 15 years ago. To validate it on a real quantum processor, my research has tested the energy teleportation protocol in its most visible form for the first time on IBM's superconducting quantum computer. In my colloquium talk, I will explain the historical background of quantum energy teleportation, quantum circuits and quantum operations. Moreover I will present a concrete setup for a long-distance and large-scale quantum energy teleportation with real [[quantum networks]].

  > In addition, I will present the results of quantum simulations with relativistic field theory as a study based on the high-energy physics perspective and the [[symmetry protected topological phase|symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of matter]] of quantum energy teleportation. The models will describe include the two dimensional QED (the massive Thirring model), the AKLT model, the [[Haldane model]], and the Kitaev model. Those results show that the phase diagrams of the field theory and SPT phase are closely related to energy teleportation.

  > In summary my talk will provide a novel suggestion that quantum energy teleportation paves a new pathway to a link between quantum communication on real [[quantum network]], phase diagram of quantum many-body system, and quantum computation.

  **Quantum Technology with Trapped Ions**

  > [[quantum physics|Quantum]] technology is a rapidly advancing field that is poised to revolutionize numerous industries, including [[quantum computing|computing]], communications, [[quantum sensing|sensing]], and [[cryptography]]. At its core, quantum technology relies on the principles of [[quantum mechanics]], which allow for the creation of devices that operate on the quantum level. These devices based on quantum technology can perform tasks that are impossible or prohibitively difficult for [[classical physics|classical]] devices. One of the most promising applications of quantum technology is in [[quantum computing]], quantum communications, and [[quantum sensors]].

  > Trapped ions are one of the promising platform for [[quantum computing]] and sensing. In this approach, individual ions are trapped in a vacuum chamber using [[electromagnetic fields]] and manipulated using [[lasers]] to perform quantum operations. As a quantum system, trapped ions offer several advantages. First, they have long coherence times, meaning that the quantum state of the ion can be preserved for a longer period, allowing for more complex calculations. Second, trapped ions can be precisely controlled and manipulated, allowing for the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates. Finally, trapped ions can be entangled with one another, allowing for the implementation of quantum algorithms that are impossible to simulate on classical computers. Trapped ions also have great potential as [[quantum sensors]]. By using the properties of the ions to measure changes in their environment, trapped ions can detect minute changes in [[temperature]], [[magnetic fields]], and [[electric fields]], among other things. This makes them useful for applications in precision measurement, such as in atomic clocks, [[gravitational wave]] detection, and magnetometry.

  > One of the major challenges facing trapped ion systems is scalability. While individual ions have been used to perform simple quantum algorithms, scaling the system up to include a large number of ions is a difficult task. However, recent advances in ion trap technology have made it possible to trap larger numbers of ions and transport them in 2D and 3D space to perform more complex operations for quantum computation and sensing experiments. Realization of such devices is not far away. As compared to present atomic clocks, a new generation of quantum-enhanced clocks is now emerging showing significantly improved accuracy. Sensitive physical measurements are an essential component of modern science and technology. Developments in [[quantum sensors]] will outdate their classical counterparts.

  > We will present recent developments and opportunities in quantum technology applications based on trapped ions, including quantum computation and sensing.

  **Detecting topological order from modular transformations of ground states on the torus**

  cf.: [arXiv:2203.04329](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04329)

  > Every two-dimensional [[topological phase]] is associated with some [[topological quantum field theory]] (TQFT), or [more formally](modular+tensor+category#AnyonicTopologicalOrderInTermsOfBraidedFusionCategoriesReferences) a [[modular tensor category]].  The [[ground states]] of a [[topological phase]] [encode information](topological+entanglement+entropy+--+references#CharacterizingTopologicalOrder) about the TQFT, which makes them useful in determining the TQFT data, such as [[anyon]] mutual statistics and self statistics.  For example, many numerical methods for detecting the TQFT [relied on](topological+entanglement+entropy+--+references#CharacterizingTopologicalOrder) the use of minimum entanglement states (MESs), which are the eigenstates of the [[Wilson loop]] operators, and are labeled by the anyons corresponding to their eigenvalues.  Here we revisit the definition of the Wilson loop operators and MESs.  We rederive the [[modular transformation]] of the [[ground states]] purely from the Wilson loop algebra, and as a result, the modular $S$- and $T$-matrices naturally show up in the overlap of MESs.  Importantly, we show that due to the phase degree of freedom of the Wilson loop operators, the MES-anyon assignment is not unique.  This ambiguity means that there are some sets of TQFTs that cannot be distinguished from one another solely by the overlap of MESs.

"Quantum hardware needs quantum software", so to say. Furthermore, due to noise in the [[qubits]], known as [[decoherence]], an additional quantum-specific software layer is required that emulates a perfect quantum machine on top of a noisy one. I will demonstrate our recent work on this subject with theorems as well data from university and commercial quantum devices.

In recent years, optically addressable [[nitrogen-vacancy center|nitrogen-vacancy (NV)]] color center hosted by [[diamond]] [[crystal]] has been used as a novel [[quantum sensor]], which has exquisitely sensitive response to local [[magnetic field]] fluctuations. It is therefore capable to perform micro-/nano-scale [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR experiments]], manifesting enormous potential to study [[biology|biological systems]] on extremely small sample volume -- even down to single-molecule regime.

  > In this seminar, I will discuss some of the comprehensive efforts to develop [[NV center|NV]]-based [[quantum sensing]] platforms for a wide range of applications in [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]. I will start with a general introduction to [[quantum sensing]] followed by conventional [[NMR]] [[spectroscopy]] as a powerful tool to study biomolecules, as well as their connections to the [[NV center|NV]]-based nanoscale [[NMR]]. I will then introduce a biocompatible surface functionalization architecture for interfacing a diamond quantum sensor with individual intact biomolecules under physiological conditions. A sensing modality based on diamond membrane integrated with flow channel will also be discussed, which is a promising platform for a variety of experiments a molecular, cellular, and even living-organism levels. Finally, I will conclude by providing an outlook on how NV-based quantum sensing platforms, combined with other advanced spectroscopy and microscopy methods, can be utilized to address important biophysical and bioanalytical questions with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, which will enhance our understanding of molecular interactions and cellular processes and ultimately improve human health.

  > We introduce an error mitigation framework that mitigates errors in a [[quantum circuit]] using circuit cutting. Our framework can be implemented in polynomial time for a wide variety of quantum circuits. Our technique involves cutting the circuit in such a way that we run the circuit that needs to be executed on the quantum hardware whereas the error mitigation circuit is run on a simulator. We perform error mitigation qubit by qubit and then provide a way to combine the different probabilities from each of the individual qubit error mitigation runs such that the full circuit is error mitigated. We apply our framework to the VQE hardware-efficient ansatz acheiving estimated ground state energies very close to the noise-free simulation results.

The [[knots-quivers correspondence]] is the statement that various invariants associated to a knot are encoded in the corresponding quiver. This statement follows from engineering both knots and quivers in related brane systems in string theory. Recent developements, which I will mention at least briefly, include understanding the structure of various quivers that correspond to the same knot, using topological recursion to determine quiver generating series and corresponding quiver A-polynomias, and finding a quiver representation of so-called Z-hat invariants.

  > In this talk I will discuss the relation between [[higher geometric quantisation]] and the [global geometry underlying](double+field+theory#ReferencesInHigherDifferentialGeometry) [[duality in string theory|string dualities]]. Higher geometric quantisation is a promising framework that makes quantisation of [[classical field theories]] achievable. This can be obtained by quantising either an ordinary prequantum bundle on the ∞-stack of solutions of the equations of motion or a categorified prequantum bundle on a generalised phase space. I will discuss how the higher quantum geometry of string theory underlies the [[topological T-duality|global geometry of]] [[T-duality]]. In particular, I will illustrate how a globally well-defined moduli stack of [[tensor hierarchies]] can be constructed and why this is related to a higher gauge theory with the [[string 2-group]]. Finally, I will interpret the formalism of Extended Field Theory as an atlas description of the higher quantum geometry of string theory.

  >  [[quasi-elliptic cohomology|Quasi-elliptic cohomology]] is closely related to [[Tate K-theory]]. It is constructed as an object both reflecting the geometric nature of [[elliptic curves]] and more practicable to study than most [[elliptic cohomology|elliptic cohomology theories]]. It can be interpreted by [[Huan's inertia orbifold|orbifold loop spaces]] and expressed in terms of [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant K-theories]]. We formulate the complete [[nLab:power operation]] of this theory. Applying that we prove the finite subgroups of the [[Tate curve]] can be classified by the Tate K-theory of [[symmetric groups]] modulo a certain transfer ideal. In this talk we construct twisted Real quasi-elliptic cohomology as the [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[KR-theory]] of [[free loop  orbifold|loop groupoids]]. The theory systematically incorporates loop rotation and reflection. After establishing basic properties of the theory, we construct Real analogues of the string power operation of quasi-elliptic cohomology. We also explore the relation of the theory to the Tate curve. This is joint work with [[Matthew Young]]. &lbrack;[arXiv:2210.07511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07511)&rbrack;

  > One of the main problems in representation theory is to determine the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of a Lie group. Using the Weil representation, [[Roger Howe]] established a one-to-one correspondence (known as the local theta correspondence) between particular representations of two subgroups $G$ and $G'$ forming a [[reductive dual pair|dual pair]] in $Sp(W)$. This correspondence provides a nice way to construct unitary representations of small Gelfand-Kirillov dimension.

  > In his wonderful paper "Remarks on classical invariant theory", Roger Howe suggested that his classical duality should be extendable to superalgebras/supergroups. In a recent work with Hadi Salmasian, we obtained a classification of irreducible reductive dual pairs in a real or complex orthosymplectic Lie supergroup $SpO(V)$. Moreover, we proved a "double commutant theorem" for all dual pairs in a real or complex orthosymplectic Lie supergroup.

  > Both [[higher structures]] and [[bundle gerbe modules]] play important roles in modern [[geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]]. [[bundle gerbe module|Bundle gerbe modules]] is a [[twisted vector bundle|twisted version]] of [[vector bundles]], and was introduced by Bouwknegt-Carey-Mathai-Murray-Stevenson in 2002. In particular, they introduced the [[twisted Chern character]] from the perspective of [[Chern-Weil theory]]. In a recent joint work with Han and Mathai, we study the [[homotopy theory]] aspects of the twisted Chern classes of torsion bundle gerbe modules. Using Sullivan's [[rational homotopy theory]], we realize the twisted Chern classes at the level of [[classifying spaces]]. The construction suggests a notion, which we call fractional U-structure serving as a universal framework to study the twisted Chern classes of torsion bundle gerbe modules from the perspective of classifying spaces. Based on this, we introduce and study higher fractional structures on torsion bundle gerbe modules parallel to the higher structures on ordinary vector bundles.

Given a "sufficiently nice" such factorization algebra on a [[manifold]] $N$, one may associate to it a factorization algebra on $N\times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$.

  > [[moduli space of flat connections|Moduli spaces of flat principal bundles]] on [[surfaces]] are a prominent object in [[mathematical physics]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[geometric representation theory]]. In particular they are the [[phase space]] of 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] on a surface times an interval and hence equipped with a [[symplectic structure]] going back to the work of [[Atiyah]] and [[Bott]]. Various [[deformation quantizations]] of the [[algebra of functions]] have been constructed. Ben-Zvi, Brochier & Jordan constructed "local to global" quantizations using [[factorization homology]] of representation categories of [[quantum groups]]. Local to global constructions in this setting only work if the [[higher geometry|higher geometric]] [[higher structure|structure]] of the moduli space of flat bundles is taken into account, i.e. it is treated as a [[moduli stack]]. In this setting the algebra of functions does not contain all the information and should be replaced by the category of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].

  > In my talk we will explore [[categorifications]] of deformation quantization as deformations of [[symmetric monoidal categories]] (algebras over the [[E-infinity operad|$E_\infty$-operad]]) into $E_i$-categories and their interplay with factorization homology. The main result is that 2-dimensional factorization homology "commutes" with [[quantization]] in a way relating $E_0$-quantizations to braided ($E_2$) quantizations. We will illustrate our results with examples from [[Poisson geometry]] and [[quantum groups]]. As a specific application we show that deformation quantizations of the moduli space of flat bundles based on Kontsevich integrals constructed by Li, Bland & Ševera are equivalent to quantizations constructed by Alekseev, Grosse & Schomerus based on quantum groups.

(These methods extend to interacting theories, thanks to the thesis of Rabinovich.)
