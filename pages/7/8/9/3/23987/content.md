    **Persistent homotopy groups of metric spaces**

    > By capturing both geometric and topological features of datasets, [[persistent homology]] has shown its promise in applications. Motivated by the fact that [[homotopy]] in general contains more information than [[homology]], we study notions of [[persistent homotopy]] groups of compact [[metric spaces]], together with their stability properties in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Under fairly mild assumptions on the spaces, we proved that the classical [[fundamental group]] has an underlying tree-like structure (i.e. a dendrogram) and an associated ultrametric. We then exhibit pairs of filtrations that are confounded by [[persistent homology]] but are distinguished by their [[persistent homotopy]] groups. We finally describe the notion of persistent [[rational homotopy theory|rational]] homotopy groups, which is easier to handle but still contains extra information compared to persistent homology.

    **Realisations of Posets**

    > My presentation  is based on an article with the same title coauthored with A. Jin and F. Tombari  ([arXiv:2112.12209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12209)).

    > Encoding information in form of  [[functors]] indexed by the [[poset]] of $r$-tuples of real numbers ([[persistence modules]]) is attractive for three reasons: 
       
    > a) metric properties  of the poset are essential  to study  distances on persistence modules

    > b) the poset of $r$-tuples of real numbers has well behaved discrete  approximations which are  used  to provide finite  approximations of  persistence modules 
       
    > c) the mentioned discretizations and approximations  have well studied algebraic and homological properties as they can be identified with  multi graded modules over polynomial rings.

    > In my talk I will describe a construction called realisation, that transforms arbitrary posets into posets  which satisfy all three requirements above and hence  are particularly suitable for persistence methods.Intuitively the realisation associates a continuous structure to a locally discrete poset by filling in empty spaces. For example the realisation of the poset of natural numbers is the poset of non-negative reals. I will focus on illustrating how [[homological algebra|homological techniques]], such as [[Koszul complexes]], can be used to study [[persistence modules]] indexed by realisations.

    **Thoughts on big data sets**


    > This talk describes work in progress. The idea is to develop methods for analyzing a very large data sets $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ in high dimensional spaces. There are well-known pitfalls to avoid, including the inability to computationally analyze [[TDA]] constructions for $X$ on account of its size, the "curse of high dimensionality", and the failure of [[excision]] for standard [[TDA]] constructions. We discuss the curse of high dimensionality and define a hypercube metric on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that may lessen its effects. The excision problem for the [[Vietoris-Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips construction]] can be addressed by expanding the [[TDA]] discussion to [[filtered object|filtered]] subobjects $K$ of Vietoris-Rips constructions. Unions of such subobjects satisfy excision in path components (clusters) and [[homology groups]], by classical results. The near-term goal is to construct, for each data point $x$, a "computable" filtered subcomplex $K_{x} \subset V(X)$ with $x \in K_{x}$, which would capture spatial local behaviour of the data set $X$ near $x$. A large (but highly parallelizable) algorithm finds a nearest neighbour, or a set of $k$-nearest neighbours for a fixed data point $x \in X$. Some variant of this algorithm may lead to a good construction of the local subcomplex $K_{x}$.

  > In this series of three talks we will explain the foam approach to [[link homology]]. Bigraded link homology theories [[categorification|categorify]] the [[Jones polynomial]] and other [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction|Reshetikhin-Turaev]] [[link invariants]], such as the [[HOMFLY-PT polynomial]]. Foams, which are [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] 2D [[cell complex|complexes]] embedded in [[Euclidean space|3-space]] allow to construct state spaces for [[planar graphs]] which are then used to define link homology groups. The most explicit and efficient way to define graph state spaces is via evaluation of the closed foams (Robert-Wagner formula).

  > A) This formula will be first explained in the less technical unoriented $SL(3)$ case. Resulting graph state spaces are then related to the Four-Color Theorem and Kronheimer-Mrowka homology for 3-[[orbifolds]].

  > B) A step in that construction requires building a topological theory (a lax TQFT) from an evaluation of closed objects, such as closed $n$-manifolds. We will explain the setup for topological theories, including in two dimensions, recovering the Deligne categories and their generalizations. In one dimension and adding defects, these topological theories are related to noncommutative power series, pseudocharacters, and, over the Boolean semiring, to [[regular languages]] and [[automata]].

  > C) Robert-Wagner $GL(N)$ foam evaluation and its application to constructing link homology theories will be explained as well.

  > [[quantum field theory|Quantum field theories]] can have an inconsistency called an [[quantum anomaly|anomaly]], formulated as an [[invertible field theory]] in one dimension higher. Theorems of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman and [Freed-Hopkins](invertible+field+theory#FreedHopkins21) classify [[invertible field theories]] in terms of [[bordism groups]]. In this talk, I'll apply this to the low-energy approximation of $E_8 \times E_8$ [[heterotic string theory]]; Witten proved anomaly cancellation in a restricted setting, but we perform a twisted string bordism computation to show that the relevant group of 11-dimensional [[invertible field theories]] does not vanish, and therefore there could be an anomaly in $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory. Standard computational techniques for twisted [[string bordism]] do not work for this problem; I will also discuss work joint with Matthew Yu using Baker-Lazarev's R-module Adams spectral sequence to simplify a large class of twisted spin and string bordism computations.

One of the central axioms is a certain local constancy condition, called the [[time-slice axiom]], that encodes a concept of time evolution.

This new class of links, which share many [[Khovanov homology|homological properties]] with alternating links, is defined in a recursive way which is not easy to use in order to determine whether a given link is quasi-alternating. In this talk, we shall review the main obstruction criteria for quasi-alternating links. We also discuss how new examples of quasi-alternating links can constructed.

As a consequence of the absence of [[global symmetries]] in [[quantum gravity|QG]], [one such conjecture](swampland#SwamplandCobordismConjecture) is saying that the [[cobordism group]] has to vanish. In mathematics very often these groups do not vanish right away. Physics tells us that this can be ameliorated by either [[gauge symmetry|gauging]] or [[symmetry breaking|breaking]] of the corresponding global symmetries.

  > First, we show how the gauging fits into some known constraints in [[string theory]], the so-called [[tadpole cancellation]] conditions.

Second, we report on new results related to the breaking of a global symmetry via [[codimension]] one [[defect QFT|defects]].

  > For a generic two-dimensional [[topological insulator]] with band inversion and [[spin-orbit coupling]], we propose the generation of topological zero-energy [[bound states]] via the application of an in-plane Zeeman field breaking rotational invariance. The Zeeman field induces a surface gap and generates the topological states via a second-order mechanism generically at the surface positions where the normal component of the Zeeman field vanishes. Via the application of an additional half-integer [[Aharonov-Bohm effect|Aharonov-Bohm]] [[flux]] through a hole of the system, we show that the topological states are protected by supersymmetry. For smooth surfaces, we derive an effective surface Hamiltonian in the form of a periodic Witten model and propose how the surface bound states of the supersymmetric spectrum can be calculated via a trapping mechanism in effective surface potentials. We study the whole phase diagram of the model together with its stability and discuss the high tunability of the topological states.

  > The aim of *[[topological data analysis]]* (TDA) is to provide qualitative analysis of large data/parameter sets in a way which is *robust* against uncertainties and noise. This is accomplished using tools and theorems from the mathematical field of *[[algebraic topology]]*. While a tool called *[[persistent homology]]* has become the signature method of TDA, it tends to produce answers that are either hard to interpret (persistent [[cycles]]) or impossible to compute ([[well groups]]). Both problems are solved by a variant method $[$[FK17](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcal17)$]$ which we may call *[[persistent cohomotopy]]*: A first result shows $[$[FKW18](persistent+cohomotopy#FranekKrcalWagner18)$]$ that this new method provides computable answers to the concrete question of detecting whether there exist data+parameters that meet a prescribed target indicator precisely, even in the presence of uncertainty and noise. More generally, efficient data analysis will require further refining [[persistent cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant cohomotopy]] and/or [[twisted cohomotopy]] $[$[[schreiber:Proper Orbifold Cohomology|SS20]]$]$. Curiously, these flavors of [[cohomotopy theory]] have [[Hypothesis H|profound relations]] to formal [[high energy physics]] and [[topological phase of matter|quantum materials]], connecting to which might help to further enhance the power of [[topological data analysis]].

  > Recent advances in magnetism research are likely to have an important impact on electronics and information processing. These advances use the electron magnetic moment (spin) to transmit, write and store information. They enable new devices that operate at high speed with very low energy consumption. The information is stored in the orientation of electron magnetic moments in magnetic materials and can persist without power; energy is only needed to write and read the information. Important physics concepts include the interconversion of electrical (charge) currents into spin currents, the efficiency of the interconversion, controlling the currents, spin polarization direction, and the associated spin torques on magnetic order. [Magnetic skyrmions](skyrmion#ReferencesInSolidStatePhysics) are also of interest both because of their stability --- they are topologically protected objects --- and because their nucleation and motion can be controlled using spin currents. In this talk I will highlight the new physics concepts that have enabled these advances and discuss some of their applications in information processing.

In this colloquium, I will discuss ideas for the noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) and early [[quantum error correction|fault-tolerant]] eras. I will divide my talk into two parts. In the first part, I will make a brief non-technical introduction to the field, its relevance to the UAE, and the main lines of research of the [Quantum Algorithms](https://www.tii.ae/quantum/our-research/quantum-algorithms) division at [QRC](https://www.tii.ae/quantum)-[TII](https://www.tii.ae/).

This provides a versatile toolbox for both error-mitigation and circuit boosts useful for NISQ computations. Then, I will move on to algorithms for the forthcoming quantum hardware of the early fault-tolerant era: I will present a new generation of high-precision algorithms for [simulating quantum imaginary-time evolution](repeat-until-success+computing#AolitaEtAl21) (QITE) that are significantly simpler than current schemes based on quantum amplitude amplification (QAA).

  **Demonstration of Quantum Energy Teleportation by Superconducting Quantum Processors and Implications for Communications and High Energy Physics**

  > Quantum energy teleportation is a theoretical concept in [[quantum physics]] that describes the transfer of [[energy]] from one location to another without the need for a physical medium to carry it. This is made possible by means of universal properties of [[quantum entanglement]] and measurement of quantum states. The role of QET in physics and information engineering is largely unexplored, as the theory has not received much attention for long time since it was proposed about 15 years ago. To validate it on a real quantum processor, my research has tested the energy teleportation protocol in its most visible form for the first time on IBM's superconducting quantum computer. In my colloquium talk, I will explain the historical background of quantum energy teleportation, quantum circuits and quantum operations. Moreover I will present a concrete setup for a long-distance and large-scale quantum energy teleportation with real [[quantum networks]].

  > In addition, I will present the results of [[quantum simulations]] with relativistic field theory as a study based on the high-energy physics perspective and the [[symmetry protected topological phase|symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of matter]] of quantum energy teleportation. The models will describe include the two dimensional QED (the massive Thirring model), the AKLT model, the [[Haldane model]], and the Kitaev model. Those results show that the phase diagrams of the field theory and SPT phase are closely related to energy teleportation.

  > In summary my talk will provide a novel suggestion that quantum energy teleportation paves a new pathway to a link between quantum communication on real [[quantum network]], phase diagram of quantum many-body system, and quantum computation.

  **Quantum Technology with Trapped Ions**

  > [[quantum physics|Quantum]] technology is a rapidly advancing field that is poised to revolutionize numerous industries, including [[quantum computing|computing]], communications, [[quantum sensing|sensing]], and [[cryptography]]. At its core, quantum technology relies on the principles of [[quantum mechanics]], which allow for the creation of devices that operate on the quantum level. These devices based on quantum technology can perform tasks that are impossible or prohibitively difficult for [[classical physics|classical]] devices. One of the most promising applications of quantum technology is in [[quantum computing]], quantum communications, and [[quantum sensors]].

  > Trapped ions are one of the promising platform for [[quantum computing]] and sensing. In this approach, individual ions are trapped in a vacuum chamber using [[electromagnetic fields]] and manipulated using [[lasers]] to perform quantum operations. As a quantum system, trapped ions offer several advantages. First, they have long coherence times, meaning that the quantum state of the ion can be preserved for a longer period, allowing for more complex calculations. Second, trapped ions can be precisely controlled and manipulated, allowing for the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates. Finally, trapped ions can be entangled with one another, allowing for the implementation of quantum algorithms that are impossible to simulate on classical computers. Trapped ions also have great potential as [[quantum sensors]]. By using the properties of the ions to measure changes in their environment, trapped ions can detect minute changes in [[temperature]], [[magnetic fields]], and [[electric fields]], among other things. This makes them useful for applications in precision measurement, such as in atomic clocks, [[gravitational wave]] detection, and magnetometry.

  > One of the major challenges facing trapped ion systems is scalability. While individual ions have been used to perform simple quantum algorithms, scaling the system up to include a large number of ions is a difficult task. However, recent advances in ion trap technology have made it possible to trap larger numbers of ions and transport them in 2D and 3D space to perform more complex operations for quantum computation and sensing experiments. Realization of such devices is not far away. As compared to present atomic clocks, a new generation of quantum-enhanced clocks is now emerging showing significantly improved accuracy. Sensitive physical measurements are an essential component of modern science and technology. Developments in [[quantum sensors]] will outdate their classical counterparts.

  > Every two-dimensional [[topological phase]] is associated with some [[topological quantum field theory]] (TQFT), or [more formally](modular+tensor+category#AnyonicTopologicalOrderInTermsOfBraidedFusionCategoriesReferences) a [[modular tensor category]].  The [[ground states]] of a [[topological phase]] [encode information](topological+entanglement+entropy+--+references#CharacterizingTopologicalOrder) about the TQFT, which makes them useful in determining the TQFT data, such as [[anyon]] mutual statistics and self statistics.  For example, many numerical methods for detecting the TQFT [relied on](topological+entanglement+entropy+--+references#CharacterizingTopologicalOrder) the use of minimum entanglement states (MESs), which are the eigenstates of the [[Wilson loop]] operators, and are labeled by the anyons corresponding to their eigenvalues.  Here we revisit the definition of the Wilson loop operators and MESs.  We rederive the [[modular transformation]] of the [[ground states]] purely from the Wilson loop algebra, and as a result, the modular $S$- and $T$-matrices naturally show up in the overlap of MESs.  Importantly, we show that due to the phase degree of freedom of the Wilson loop operators, the MES-anyon assignment is not unique.  This ambiguity means that there are some sets of TQFTs that cannot be distinguished from one another solely by the overlap of MESs.

  **High-fidelity universal quantum computation with symmetric qubit clusters**

  > Designing a physical device that maintains the error rate for each quantum processing operation low is one of the most arduous issues for the implementation of a scalable [[quantum computer]]. These errors may result from inaccurate quantum manipulation, such as a gate voltage sweeping in [[solid-state physics|solid-state]] [[qubits]] or a [[laser]] pulse duration. [[decoherence|Decoherence]] is usually a manifestation of the interaction with the environment, and it is an entity of the [[quantum system]] which generates errors. Small clusters of [[qubits]] with symmetries can be used to shield part of them from [[decoherence]]. We encode pairs of connected qubits and universal 2-qubit [[quantum gates|logical gates]] using 4-level cores with omega-rotation invariance. We show that symmetry renders logical operations particularly resistant to anisotropic qubit rotations that models some quantum errors. We suggest a scalable method for universal quantum processing in which cores act as quansistors, or quantum transistors.

  > In [[NMR|magnetic resonance]], optimal control theory is used to generate pulses and pulse sequences that achieve instrumentally difficult objectives (for example, uniform 13C excitation in a 1.2 GHz magnet) with high precision under stringent time and radiofrequency/microwave power constraints. At the moment, the most popular framework is GRAPE (gradient ascent pulse engineering, [10.1016/j.jmr.2004.11.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2004.11.004)). This lecture reports our recent mathematical and software engineering work on the various extensions and refinements of the GRAPE framework, and on its implementation as a module of Spinach library. Recently implemented functionality includes: fidelity Hessians and regularised Newton-Raphson optimisation, generalised curvilinear waveform parametrisation, prefix and suffix pulse sequences, multi-target and subspace control, keyhole states and subspaces, cooperative pulses and phase cycles, and piecewise-linear control sequences. In keeping with the long tradition, the methods are also directly applicable to quantum technologies outside Magnetic Resonance.

I will introduce the theory behind this concept, both for noninteracting as well as interacting systems and consecutively discuss two realizations in rather distinct setups. First, as-grown crystals of bismuth, grey arsenic, as well as bismuth bromide are demonstrated to display the essential physics of higher-order topological insulators. Second, it is shown that lattices of so-called Shiba bound states induced by magnetic adatoms in conventional superconductors can be brought into a higher-order superconducting phase.

  **Quantum Delegation with an Off-the-Shelf Device**

  cf. [arXiv:2304.03448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03448)

  > Given that reliable cloud [[quantum computers]] are becoming closer to reality, the concept of delegation of [[quantum computations]] and its [[software verification|verifiability]] is of central interest. Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted, off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input. In the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of the computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic verification device, all in a single round.  In this talk, we will show how the delegation of quantum computations can be achieved in the OTS model, and furthermore how to make this protocol zero-knowledge. The emphasis will be on the concepts that contribute to this result; these concepts are drawn from a long line of research related to blind and delegated quantum computation, as well as quantum zero-knowledge proofs.

  > [[Quipper]] is a [[functional programming language]] for [[quantum computing]]. Proto-Quipper is a family of languages aiming to provide a [[formal methods|formal foundation]] for Quipper. By virtue of being a [[quantum circuit|circuit]] description language, Proto-Quipper has two separate runtimes: circuit generation time and circuit execution time. Values that are known at circuit generation time are called parameters, and values that are known at circuit execution time are called states. [[dynamic lifting|Dynamic lifting]] is an operation that enables a state, such as the result of a [[quantum measurement|measurement]], to be lifted to a parameter, where it can influence the generation of the next portion of the circuit. As a result, dynamic lifting enables Proto-Quipper programs to [interleave classical and quantum computation](quantum+computation#ClassicalControlQuantumData). In his talk, Dr. Frank will describe how to extend Proto-Quipper-M with dynamic lifting. He will explain the syntax of a language named Proto-Quipper-Dyn. Its type system uses a system of [[modalities]] to keep track of the use of dynamic lifting. Then, he will discuss the [[categorical semantics]] for dynamic lifting. Finally, if time permits, Dr. Frank will give some examples of Proto-Quipper-Dyn programs.

  > In this talk I will discuss the relation between [[higher geometric quantisation]] and the [global geometry underlying](double+field+theory#ReferencesInHigherDifferentialGeometry) [[duality in string theory|string dualities]]. Higher geometric quantisation is a promising framework that makes quantisation of [[classical field theories]] achievable. This can be obtained by quantising either an ordinary prequantum bundle on the ∞-stack of solutions of the equations of motion or a categorified prequantum bundle on a generalised phase space. I will discuss how the higher quantum geometry of string theory underlies the [[topological T-duality|global geometry of]] [[T-duality]]. In particular, I will illustrate how a globally well-defined moduli stack of [[tensor hierarchies]] can be constructed and why this is related to a higher gauge theory with the [[string 2-group]].

A more thorough investigation of multiplicative norms, using the language of operads, was recently conducted by Blumberg and Hill, though the existence in general of their new “N-infinity” operads was left as a conjecture. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the Kervaire problem and its solution, I will explain where the [[operads]] enter the story, and I will prove the Blumberg-Hill conjecture using a new model structure on the categoryof equivariant operads.

  >  [[quasi-elliptic cohomology|Quasi-elliptic cohomology]] is closely related to [[Tate K-theory]]. It is constructed as an object both reflecting the geometric nature of [[elliptic curves]] and more practicable to study than most [[elliptic cohomology|elliptic cohomology theories]]. It can be interpreted by [[Huan's inertia orbifold|orbifold loop spaces]] and expressed in terms of [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant K-theories]]. We formulate the complete [[nLab:power operation]] of this theory. Applying that we prove the finite subgroups of the [[Tate curve]] can be classified by the Tate K-theory of [[symmetric groups]] modulo a certain transfer ideal. In this talk we construct twisted Real quasi-elliptic cohomology as the [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] [[KR-theory]] of [[free loop  orbifold|loop groupoids]]. The theory systematically incorporates loop rotation and reflection. After establishing basic properties of the theory, we construct Real analogues of the string power operation of quasi-elliptic cohomology. We also explore the relation of the theory to the Tate curve. This is joint work with [[Matthew Young]]. &lbrack;[arXiv:2210.07511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07511)&rbrack;

  > One of the main problems in representation theory is to determine the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of a Lie group. Using the Weil representation, [[Roger Howe]] established a one-to-one correspondence (known as the local theta correspondence) between particular representations of two subgroups $G$ and $G'$ forming a [[reductive dual pair|dual pair]] in $Sp(W)$. This correspondence provides a nice way to construct unitary representations of small Gelfand-Kirillov dimension.

  > In his wonderful paper "Remarks on classical invariant theory", Roger Howe suggested that his classical duality should be extendable to superalgebras/supergroups. In a recent work with Hadi Salmasian, we obtained a classification of irreducible reductive dual pairs in a real or complex orthosymplectic Lie supergroup $SpO(V)$. Moreover, we proved a "double commutant theorem" for all dual pairs in a real or complex orthosymplectic Lie supergroup.

  > Both [[higher structures]] and [[bundle gerbe modules]] play important roles in modern [[geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]]. [[bundle gerbe module|Bundle gerbe modules]] is a [[twisted vector bundle|twisted version]] of [[vector bundles]], and was introduced by Bouwknegt-Carey-Mathai-Murray-Stevenson in 2002. In particular, they introduced the [[twisted Chern character]] from the perspective of [[Chern-Weil theory]]. In a recent joint work with Han and Mathai, we study the [[homotopy theory]] aspects of the twisted Chern classes of torsion bundle gerbe modules. Using Sullivan's [[rational homotopy theory]], we realize the twisted Chern classes at the level of [[classifying spaces]]. The construction suggests a notion, which we call fractional U-structure serving as a universal framework to study the twisted Chern classes of torsion bundle gerbe modules from the perspective of classifying spaces. Based on this, we introduce and study higher fractional structures on torsion bundle gerbe modules parallel to the higher structures on ordinary vector bundles.

In the [[BV-formalism|Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism]], one finds that a factorization algebra of classical observables possesses, in addition to its factorization-algebraic structure, a compatible [[Poisson bracket]] of cohomological degree +1.  Given a "sufficiently nice" such factorization algebra on a [[manifold]] $N$, one may associate to it a factorization algebra on $N\times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$.

  > [[moduli space of flat connections|Moduli spaces of flat principal bundles]] on [[surfaces]] are a prominent object in [[mathematical physics]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[geometric representation theory]]. In particular they are the [[phase space]] of 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] on a surface times an interval and hence equipped with a [[symplectic structure]] going back to the work of [[Atiyah]] and [[Bott]]. Various [[deformation quantizations]] of the [[algebra of functions]] have been constructed. Ben-Zvi, Brochier & Jordan constructed "local to global" quantizations using [[factorization homology]] of representation categories of [[quantum groups]]. Local to global constructions in this setting only work if the [[higher geometry|higher geometric]] [[higher structure|structure]] of the moduli space of flat bundles is taken into account, i.e. it is treated as a [[moduli stack]]. In this setting the algebra of functions does not contain all the information and should be replaced by the category of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].

  > In my talk we will explore [[categorifications]] of deformation quantization as deformations of [[symmetric monoidal categories]] (algebras over the [[E-infinity operad|$E_\infty$-operad]]) into $E_i$-categories and their interplay with factorization homology. The main result is that 2-dimensional factorization homology "commutes" with [[quantization]] in a way relating $E_0$-quantizations to braided ($E_2$) quantizations. We will illustrate our results with examples from [[Poisson geometry]] and [[quantum groups]]. As a specific application we show that deformation quantizations of the moduli space of flat bundles based on Kontsevich integrals constructed by Li, Bland & Ševera are equivalent to quantizations constructed by Alekseev, Grosse & Schomerus based on quantum groups.

  > By recalling the textbook description of a ([[variational calculus|variational]]) [[classical field theory]] and its [[critical locus]] of [[on-shell]] [[field (physics)|fields]], I will list desiderata for a [[category]] in which this can rigorously take place. This category will consist of [[generalized smooth spaces]], completely determined by "how they may be smoothly probed by finite dimensional manifolds". By expanding on this intuition, I will describe how one naturally arrives at the definition of a [[smooth set]] as a "[[sheaf]] over the [[site]] [[CartSp|of]] [[Cartesian spaces]]''. I will then explain how the [[sheaf topos]] of [[smooth sets]] satisfies the desiderata of (variational) classical field theory. Time permitting, I will indicate how the setting naturally generalizes to include the description of [[fermionic fields]], and ([[gauge field|gauge]]) fields with [[internal symmetries]].

  **Simplicial Distributions and Contextuality**

  cf. [arXiv:2204.06648](quantum+contextuality#OkayKharoofIpek22)

  >  In modern [[homotopy theory]], spaces are represented by combinatorial models called [[simplicial sets]]. Their elegant formulation gives them great expressive power to capture spaces up to homotopy. Simplicial distributions are basic mathematical objects that mix simplicial sets with [[probability|probabilities]]. That is, they model probability distributions on spaces. In my talk, I will show how simplicial distributions provide a framework for studying a central quantum feature associated with probabilities, known as [[quantum contextuality|contextuality]]. A typical [[quantum measurement|measurement]] scenario consists of a set of measurements and outcomes, whereas simplicial distributions can be defined for spaces of measurements and outcomes. Our approach unifies and goes beyond two earlier approaches: the sheaf-theoretic ([Abramsky-Brandenburger](quantum+contextuality#AbramskyBrandenburger11)) and group cohomological ([Okay-Roberts-Bartlett-Raussendorf](quantum+contextuality#OkayRobertsBartlettRaussendorf17)).

  > In their 1967 book "[[Calculus of Fractions and Homotopy Theory]]", [[Pierre Gabriel|P. Gabriel]] and [[Michel Zisman|M. Zisman]] introduced *[[calculus of fractions]]* as a tool for understanding the [[localization of a category]] at a class of [[weak equivalences]]. While powerful, the condition of calculus of fractions is quite restrictive and it is rarely satisfied in various [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] settings, like [[model categories]] or [[Kenneth Brown|Brown]]'s [[categories of fibrant objects]], where one instead has homotopy calculus of fractions. This talk is based on a recent preprint [arXiv:2306.02218](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02218), which aims to reconcile the two. We define [[calculus of fractions]] for [[quasicategories]] and give a workable model for [[marked simplicial set|marked]] quasicategories satisfying our condition. Although we have already found several applications of this result, we would be very interested in getting feedback from the audience and exploring new applications from diverse areas.

  **Ultra Unification, and Noninvertible Symmetry of the Standard Model from Gravitational Anomaly**

  > In the [[standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]], the total "[[sterile neutrino|sterile right-handed]]" [[neutrino]] number $n_{vR}$ is not equal to the family number $N_f$. The anomaly index $(-N_f + n_{vR})$ had been advocated to play an important role in the previous work on *Cobordism and Deformation Class of the Standard Model* &lbrack;[arxiv:2112.14765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14765), [arxiv:2204.08393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08393)&rbrack; and *Ultra Unification* &lbrack;[arXiv:2012.15860](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15860)&rbrack;, in order to predict new highly [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] sectors beyond the Standard Model. Ultra Unification would combine the Standard Model and [[GUT|Grand Unification]], particularly for the models with 15 [[Weyl spinor|Weyl fermions]] per family, without the necessity of [[sterile neutrino|right-handed sterile neutrinos]], by adding new gapped [[topological phase of matter|topological phase]] sectors (in 4d or 5d) or new gapless interacting [[conformal field theory|conformal]] sectors (in 4d) consistent with the [[nonperturbative effect|nonperturbative]] global [[anomaly cancellation]] and cobordism constraints (especially from the mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly, such as a $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ class anomaly, associated with the baryon minus [[lepton]] number B−L and the [[electroweak field|electroweak]] [[hypercharge]] $Y$). Moreover, for the Standard Mode alone, the invertible B−L symmetry [[conserved charge|current]] conservation can be violated quantum mechanically by gravitational backgrounds such as gravitational instantons, hypothetically pertinent for [[leptogenesis]] in the very early [[observable universe|universe]]. In specific, we show that a [[generalized global symmetry|noninvertible categorical]] counterpart of the B−L symmetry still survives in gravitational backgrounds. In general, we construct noninvertible symmetry charge operators as topological [[defect field theory|defects]] derived from invertible anomalous symmetries that suffer from mixed [[gravitational anomalies]]. Examples include the perturbative local and nonperturbative global anomalies classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ respectively. For this construction, we utilize the [[anomaly inflow]] concept, the 4d [[Pontryagin class]] and the gravitational [[Chern-Simons form|Chern-Simons 3-form]], the 3d [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction|Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev-type]] [[topological quantum field theory]] with a framing anomaly corresponding to a 2d [[rational conformal field theory]] with an appropriate chiral [[central charge]], and the 4d $\mathbb{Z}_4$^{TF}-[[time-reversal symmetry|time-reversal symmetric]] [[topological superconductor]] with 3d boundary topological order &lbrack;[arxiv:2302.14862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14862)&rbrack;.

  > [[Hilbert spaces]] form more than a category: their morphisms maps can be composed, but also every morphism $f : X \to Y$ has a distinguished "[[adjoint operator|adjoint]]" $f^\dagger : Y \to X$, making it into a "[[dagger category]]". This extra data is important for axiomatizing [[functional analysis]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum information theory]]... However, the assignment $f \mapsto f^\dagger$ is unsatisfying from a [[higher category theory|higher category theorist]]'s perspective because it is "evil", i.e. it violates the [[principle of equivalence]]: a category [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[dagger category]] may not admit a dagger structure. This in particular interferes with generalizing the notion of dagger category to the (non-strict) [[higher categories]] necessary for axiomatizing [[extended field theory|fully-local quantum field theory]]. In this talk I will propose a manifestly non-evil definition of "dagger $(\infty,n)$-category". The same machinery also produce a non-evil definitions of "pivotal $(\infty,n)$-category" and helps to clarify the relationship between [[reflection positivity]] and [[spin-statistics theorem|spin-statistics]]. This is based on joint work with [[Bruce Bartlett|B. Bartlett]], G. Ferrar, B. Hungar, C. Krulewski, [[Lukas Müller|L. Müller]], N. Nivedita, [[David Penneys|D. Penneys]], [[David Reutter|D. Reutter]], [[Claudia Scheimbauer|C. Scheimbauer]], [[Luuk Stehouwer|L. Stehouwer]], and C. Vuppulury.

  > [[manifold diagram|Manifold diagrams]] are the [[higher category|higher]] [[categorifications]] of [[string diagrams]]. They lie at the intersection of several interesting topics, such as: 1. The [[tangle hypothesis|tangle]] and [[cobordism hypotheses]], 2. The constructive description of [[computads|free higher categorical structures]], 3. The combinatorialization of differential structures and [singularities](cobordism+hypothesis#ForCobordismsWithSingularities). Nonetheless, the precise role of manifold diagrams in these topics remains largely mysterious. In this talk, we will focus on describing the basic interplay between ([[stratified space|stratified]]) geometry, [[combinatorics]], and (directed) cell complexes, exposed by the mathematical framework of manifold diagrams. This will include, in particular, two equivalent definitions of manifold diagrams, one geometric and one combinatorial, as well as a discussion of how these relate to the above topics

  > The proper concept of [[nLab:data types]] in [[nLab:quantum programming languages]], hence of their [[nLab:certified programming|formal verification]] and [[nLab:categorical semantics]], has remained somewhat elusive, as witnessed by the issue of "[dynamic lifting](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Quipper#ReferencesDynamicLifting)" encountered in the [[nLab:Quipper]] language family. In this talk I explain our claim that a powerful [[nLab:quantum computation|quantum]] [[nLab:data type]]-system elegantly solving these problems is naturally provided by the *[[nLab:linear homotopy type theory]]* recently [realized](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22) by [[nLab:Mitchell Riley|M. Riley]]. Together with our [previous claim](Topological+Quantum+Programming+in+TED-K#GMConAbs) that [[nLab:homotopy type theory]] natively knows about the fine detail of [[nLab:su(2)-anyon|$\mathfrak{su}$(2)-]][[nlab:anyon]] [[nLab:braid representation|braid]] [[nLab:quantum gates]], this shows that [[nLab:linear homotopy type theory]] is a natural substrate for [[nLab:type theory|typed]] [[nLab:quantum programming languages]] aware of [[nLab:topological phases of matter|topological]] [[nLab:quantum materials|quantum hardware]].
