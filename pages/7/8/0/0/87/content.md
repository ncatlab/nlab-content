**Anafunctors** are the proper notion of morphism to use between categories in a context where the [[axiom of choice]] fails. Functors, as normally defined, are really not the correct concept.

Anafunctors were first developed by [[Michael Makkai]] to do ordinary category theory with a [[foundations]] that does not include the axiom of choice. Later they were applied by [[Toby Bartels]] to [[internalization|internal categories]], where the axiom of choice is simply not an option. These actually turned out to be known already (at least up to equivalence) in some contexts, in particular as [[Hilsumâ€“Skandalis morphism]]s between [[Lie groupoid]]s.

Anafunctors can be seen as an approach to [[stack]]s through their [[descent data]]. In the spirit of [[higher category theory]], [[Urs Schreiber]] is generalising this to $n$-anafunctors and $\omega$-anafucntors.
