#Idea#

**Anafunctors** are the proper notion of morphism to use between categories in a context where the [[axiom of choice]] fails. Functors, as normally defined, are really not the correct concept.

Anafunctors were first developed by [[Michael Makkai]] to do ordinary category theory with a [[foundations]] that does not include the axiom of choice. Later they were applied by [[Toby Bartels]] to [[internalization|internal categories]], where the axiom of choice is simply not an option. These actually turned out to be known already (at least up to equivalence) in some contexts, in particular as [[Hilsumâ€“Skandalis morphism]]s between [[Lie groupoid]]s.

#Homotopy-theoretic interpretation#

From the point of view of the [[homotopy theory]] of categories -- the [[folk model structure]] -- anafunctors are precisely the spans out of [[homotopy theory|acyclic fibrations]] in $Cat$

$$
  (anafunctor: C \to D)
  \Leftrightarrow
  (span in Cat: \;\;
    C \lt\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}
    \hat H \to D
  )
$$

and hence precisely the one-step generalized morphisms. 

**Saturated anafunctors** are precisely those spans where als the right leg is an acyclic fibration

$$
  (saturated anafunctor: C \to D)
  \Leftrightarrow
  (span in Cat: \;\;
    C \lt\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}
    \hat H \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}\gt D
  )
  \,.
$$

I think that you're wrong here, Urs. Having both spans acyclic makes the anafunctor *invertible*, not *saturated*. Similarly, Morita equivalences are invertible, while Hilsum&#8211;Skandalis morphisms need not be. (The difference between saturated and unsaturated anafunctors is not vital, since they are the same up to equivalence (but not isomorphism). Whether an anafunctor is invertible, in contrast, is very important.) &#8212;[[Toby Bartels]]

In the context of [[Lie groupoid]] theory such spans are known as [[Morita equivalence]]s.

If we restrict from categories to groupoids, then according to the [[folk model structure|groupoid folk model structure]] by Brown-Golasinski all objects are _fibrant_ and then according to Kenneth Brown's theorem in [[homotopical cohomology theory]] it follows that one-step generalized morphisms already realize the full localization of $Groupoids$ in that they represent all morphisms in the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Groupoids)$.

By the general idea of [[homotopical cohomology theory]]
this means that anafunctors between groupoids represent [[nonabelian cocycles]] on groupoids with values in groupoids. By the notion of [[descent and codescent|codescent]] such homotopical cocycles are related to [[descent and codescent|descent data]] that enters the definition of [[sheaf|sheaves]] and [[stack]]s.

##Generalizations##

Since the [[folk model structure]] on $Categories$ extends to [[omega category|omega categories]], also the anafunctor concept generalizes to these strict [[higher category theory|higher categories]]. Indeed, again by Brown-Golasinski, $\omega$-groupoids are fibrant with respect to the [[folk model structure]], so that the corresponding _$\omega$-anafunctors_ between $\omega$-groupoids represent cocycles in [[nonabelian cohomology]].

More details on $\omega$-anafunctors are described in the context of [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology]] in the private area of the $n$Lab. 

## Additive version ##

The notion of abelian [[butterfly]] introduced by Behrang Noohi [Weak maps of 2-groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0506313) is the additive version of the notion of (saturated) anafunctor: the equivalence between, on the one hand, internal groupoids and internal functors and, on the other hand, arrows and commutative squares in an abelian category extends to an equivalence between saturated anafunctors and butterflies.
