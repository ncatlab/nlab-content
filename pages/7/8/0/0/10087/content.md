## Idea

A _spherical fibration_ is a [[fiber bundle]] of [[spheres]] of some [[dimension]] (a [[sphere fiber bundle]]). Typically this is considered in [[homotopy theory]] where one considers [[fibrations]] whose [[fibers]] have the [[homotopy type]] of [[spheres]]; and this in turn is often considered in [[stable homotopy theory]] after [[stabilization]] (hence up to tensoring with trivial spherical fibrations)  which makes spherical fibrations models for [[(∞,1)-module bundles]] for the [[sphere spectrum]] regarded as an [[E-∞ ring]].

Every [[real vector bundle]] becomes a spherical fibration in the sense of [[homotopy theory]] upon removing its [[zero section]] and this construction induces a map from vector bundles and in fact from [[topological K-theory]] to spherical fibrations, called the _[[J-homomorphism]]_.


This is closely related to the [[Thom space]]/[[Thom spectrum]] construction for vector bundles. 

## Definition


### In components

For $X$ (the [[homotopy type]] of) a [[topological space]], a _spherical fibration over it_ is a [[fibration]] $E \to X$ such that each [[fiber]] has the [[homotopy type]] of a [[sphere]].

Given two spherical fibrations $E_1, E_2 \to X$, there is their fiberwise [[smash product]] $E_1 \wedge_X E_2 \to X$. 

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write $\epsilon^n \colon X \times S^n \to X$ for the trivial sphere bundle of fiber dimension $n$. Two spherical fibrations $E_1, E_2 \to X$ are _stably fiberwise equivalent_ if there exists $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that there is a map

$$
  E_1 \wedge_X \epsilon^{n_1}
  \longrightarrow
  E_2 \wedge_X \epsilon^{n_2}
$$

over $X$ which is fiberwise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

One consider the [[abelian group]] 

$$
  Sph(X) \in Ab
$$

to be the [[Grothendieck group]] of stable fiberwise equivalence classes of spherical fibrations, under fiberwise smash product. 


### Classifying space

There is an associative [[H-space]], $G_n$, of homotopy equivalences of the $(n-1)$-sphere with composition. Then $B G_n$ acts as the [[classifying space]] for spherical fibrations with spherical fibre $S^{n-1}$ ([Stasheff 63](#Stasheff63)).

There is an inclusion of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$ into $G_n$.

Suspension gives a map $G_n \to G_{n+1}$ whose limit is denoted $G$. Then $B G$ classifies stable spherical fibrations.

## Properties

### Adams conjecture

The [[Adams conjecture]] (a theorem) characterizes certain spherical fibrations in the image of the [[J-homomorphism]] as trivial.

### Gysin sequence

The [[long exact sequence in cohomology]] induced by a spherical fibration is called a _[[Gysin sequence]]_.
