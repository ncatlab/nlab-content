## Idea

An F-norm is a non-homogeneous variant of a [[norm]]: a translation-invariant [[metric]] on a [[vector space]] that satisfies properties in between being a [[G-norm]] (on the underlying [[abelian group]] of the vector space) and being a norm.  As with norms, there is a semi- variant.


## Definitions

Let $K$ be a [[topological field]] (typically the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]], but conceivably only a [[topological ring]], or at least a [[commutative ring|commutative]] one); we will call the elements of $K$ ''scalars''.  Let $V$ be a [[vector space]] (or [[module over a ring|module]]) over $K$; we will call the elements of $V$ ''vectors''.  Let $\|{-}\|$ be a [[function]] from (the underlying set of) $V$ to the set of [[real numbers]].

###### Definition

If

1. ${\|0_V\|} = 0$ (or even just ${\|0\|} \leq 0$),
2. ${\|{-x}\|} = {\|x\|}$ (or even just ${\|{-x}\|} \leq {\|x\|}$) for each vector $x$, and
3. ${\|x + y\|} \leq {\|x\|} + {\|y\|}$ for each vector $x$ and vector $y$ (the [[triangle inequality]]),

then ${\|{-}\|}$ is a __[[G-seminorm]]__.
=--

This is enough to prove that ${\|x\|} \geq 0$ for each $x$ in $V$, making $(x,y) \mapsto {\|y - x\|}$ (precisely) a translation-invariant [[pseudometric]] on $V$.

Note that addition $(x,y) \mapsto x + y\colon V \times V \to V$ is a [[short map]] under this pseudometric and so certainly [[continuous map|continuous]].

+-- {: .num_defn #Fseminorm}
###### Definition

If

1. $\|{-}\|$ is a G-seminorm and
2. scalar multiplication $(a,x) \mapsto a x\colon K \times V \to V$ is continuous (relative to the topology on $K$ and the pseudometric on $V$),

then $\|{-}\|$ is an __F-seminorm__.
=--

If the topology on $K$ is given by an [[absolute value]] $|{-}|$, then we can go further:

+-- {: .num_defn #seminorm}
###### Definition

If

1. ${\|x + y\|} \leq {\|x\|} + {\|y\|}$ for each vector $x$ and vector $y$ and
2. ${\|a x\|} = {|a|} {\|x\|}$ for each scalar $a$ and vector $x$,

then $\|{-}\|$ is a __[[seminorm]]__.
=--

Every seminorm is automatically an F-seminorm.

No longer assuming anything further about $K$, there are some subsidiary definitions:

+-- {: .num_defn #Fnorm}
###### Definition

If

1. $\|{-}\|$ is an F-seminorm and
2. $x = 0_V$ whenever $x$ is a vector and ${\|x\|} = 0$,

then $\|{-}\|$ is an __F-norm__.
=--

Thus an F-norm is precisely an F-seminorm whose induced pseudometric is a [[metric]].  (Compare the relationship between [[G-norms]] and [[norms]] with G-seminorms in \ref{Gseminorm} and seminorms in \ref{seminorm} above.)

+-- {: .num_defn #Fspace}
###### Definition

If

1. $\|{-}\|$ is an F-norm and
2. $x$ converges under the metric on $V$ whenever $x$ is a [[net]] of vectors and $\lim_{i,j} {\|x_j - x_i\|} = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$,

then $(V,{\|{-}\|})$ is an __F-space__.
=--

In other words, an F-space is a vector space equipped with an F-norm whose induced metric is [[complete metric|complete]] (or equivalently such that the topology on $V$ is [[complete topological group|complete]]).

+-- {: .num_defn #Frechetspace}
###### Definition

If

1. $(V,{\|{-}\|})$ is an F-space and
2. $(V,{\|{-}\|})$ is [[locally convex space|locally convex]] as a topological vector space,

then $(V,{\|{-}\|})$ is a __[[Fr√©chet space]]__.
=--

Finally, $F Sp$ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are F-spaces and whose morphisms are [[short linear maps]]; that said, often people really study the [[essential image]] of that category within the category of [[topological vector spaces]], or [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the category whose objects are F-spaces and whose morphisms are [[continuous map|continuous]] linear maps.  (This is especially so with Fr&#233;chet spaces, which have a common alternative definition that makes no reference to a canonical metric.)


## Examples

The usual examples of F-spaces that are not Fr&#233;chet spaces are the [[Lebesgue spaces]] $l^p$ for $p \lt 0 \lt 1$.  These use a modified $p$-[[p-norm|norm]] in which
$$ {\|x\|_p} = \sum_i {|x_i|^p} $$
(so without the $p$th root) to ensure that the [[triangle inequality]] (\ref{Gseminorm}.3) holds.
