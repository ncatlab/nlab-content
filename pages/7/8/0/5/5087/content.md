## Definition

A [[geometric morphism]] is **surjective** if it satisfies the following equivalent criteria:

* its [[inverse image functor]] is [[faithful functor|faithful]].
* its [[inverse image functor]] is [[conservative functor|conservative]].
* it is [[comonadic adjunction|comonadic]].

## Properties

There is a [[factorization system on a 2-category|factorization system]] on the [[2-category]] [[Topos]] whose left class is the surjective geometric morphisms and whose right class is the [[geometric embeddings]].  The factorization of a given geometric morphism $f$ can be given by constructing the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of the [[comonad]] $f^* f_*$.
