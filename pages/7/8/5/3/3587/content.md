**Lars H&#246;rmander** is a Swedish analyst and Fields medalist. His work in [[harmonic analysis]], especially [[microlocal analysis]] and the analysis of linear [[partial differential equation|PDEs]] was a very central contribution to this theory in the 1960s and 1970s. He wrote also several books including  his magnus treatise

* _The analysis of linear partial differential operators_, in 4 vols.: I. Distribution theory and Fourier analysis, II. Differential operators with constant coefficients, III. Pseudo-differential operators, IV. Fourier integral operators.
