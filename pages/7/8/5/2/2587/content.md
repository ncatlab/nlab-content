The string group $String(n)$  is a 3-connected cover of the [[Spin group]] $Spin(n)$. The latter is a Lie group but $String(n)$ isn't, due to the fact that the third homotopy group is nontrivial for (finite dimensional) Lie group

[[David Roberts]]: This raises an interesting question: is there an infinite dimensional Lie group which is a 3-connected cover? This seems very hard to do.

There is a model due to Stolz and Teichner in 'What is an elliptic object?'...

The reason for the name is that in String theory, for (blah) to be well-defined, it is necessary for the structure group of (blah) to lift to (blah).

If one considers passing to the (free) loop space of spacetime and then doing quantum mechanics, the requirement of the previous paragraph is that the structure group lifts to ... (cite Killingback, Mickelsson, Schreiber, Witten,...)

For a more general Lie group $G$, a 3-connected cover of $G$ has gained  the name $String_G$ in analogy with the original case.
