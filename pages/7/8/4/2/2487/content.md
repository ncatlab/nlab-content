Given a commutative [[field]] $k$, the **general linear group** $GL(n,k)$ (or $GL_n(k)$) is the group of invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $k$. It can be considered as a subvariety of the affine space $M_{n\times n}(k)$ of square matrices of size $n$ carved out by the equations saying that the [[determinant]] of a matrix is zero. This variety is an algebraic $k$-group, and if $k$ is the field of real, complex or p-adic numbers, it is a Lie group over $k$.

One can in fact consider the set of invertible matrices over an arbitrary unital [[ring]], not necessarily commutative. Thus $GL_n: R\mapsto GL_n(R)$ becomes a presheaf of groups on $Aff=Ring^{op}$ where one can take rings either in commutative or in noncommutative sense. In commutative case, this functor defines a group scheme. 

Coordinate rings of general linear groups and of special general linear groups have [[quantum group|quantum deformations]] called quantum linear groups.
