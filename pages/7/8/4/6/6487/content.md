## Idea

What are called the __standard conjectures on algebraic cycles__ are several [[conjectures]] brought up by [[Grothendieck]], concerned with the relation between [[algebraic cycles]] and [[Weil cohomology]] theories. The first (Lefschetz standard conjecture) is an existence assertion for algebraic cycles ([Grothendieck - 68](#Grothendieck68)), the second (Hodge standard conjecture) is a statement of positivity, generalising Weil's well-known positivity theorem in the theory of abelian varieties ([Grothendieck - 68](#Grothendieck68)). They were also followed by "[[Beilinson conjecture|Beilinson's dream]]" on [[motive|motivic]] (complexes of) sheaves which comprise what are called the _standard conjectures of [[Beilinson]]_. 

## Conclusions

The proof of the two standard conjectures would yield results going considerably further than Weil's conjectures. They would form the basis of the so-called "theory of [[motive]]s" which is a systematic theory of "arithmetic properties" of [[algebraic variety]](ies), as embodied in their groups of classes of cycles for numerical equivalence. We have at present only a very small part of this theory in dimension one, as contained in the theory of [[abelian variety]](ies).  ([Grothendieck - 68](#Grothendieck68))

Alongside the problem of resolution of singularities, the proof of the standard conjectures seems to me to be the most urgent task in algebraic geometry.
