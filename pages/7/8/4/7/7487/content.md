## Idea

A *directed-complete partial order* (DCPO), is a [[poset]] with all [[directed joins]].  Often a DCPO is required to have a [[bottom element]] $\bot$; then it is called a *[[pointed object|pointed]] DCPO* or a *CPO* (but this term is ambiguous).

The [[morphisms]] between DCPOs preserve the directed joins; equivalently, they are [[Scott continuity|Scott-continuous]].  Morphisms between pointed DCPOs may or may not be required to preserve $\bot$, depending on the application.

In [[domain theory]], a DCPO $P$ is interpreted as a [[type]] (in the sense of [[programming languages]], cf. *[[data type]]*), and its [[elements]] are possible partial (in the sense of a [[partial function]]) results of a [[computation]].  The [[bottom element]] (if there is one) indicates that no result has been obtained; if $x \leq y$ in $P$, then $x$ consists of part of the information in $y$.  A [[directed set|directed subset]] $D$ of $P$ indicates a collection of partial results which are mutually consistent, since for any two results $x, y \in D$, there is a partial result that subsumes them both.  The required join of $D$ is then a partial result encoding the same information as $D$ itself.


## Definitions

Recall that a [[poset]] $P$ consists of a collection of [[elements]] equipped with a [[binary relation]] $\leq$ such that $x \leq x$ always and $x \leq z$ whenever $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$; we also consider $x$ and $y$ to be equal whenever $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$.

Recall that a [[subset]] $D$ of $P$ is [[directed set|semidirected]] iff, whenever $x, y \in D$, there is some $z \in D$ such that $x \leq z$ and $y \leq z$.  Then $D$ is directed iff it is semidirected and [[inhabited subset|inhabited]].

Recall that an [[upper bound]] of a subset $D$ of $P$ is an element $x$ such that $y \leq x$ whenever $y \in D$, and a [[join]] of $D$ is an upper bound $x$ such that $x \leq y$ whenever $y$ is an upper bound of $D$.  The join of $D$, if one exists, is unique, and we write it $\bigvee D$ (or even put a little arrow on the right flank of the symbol when $D$ is directed).  A [[bottom element]] is a join of the [[empty subset]].

\begin{definition}
\label{TheDefinition}
A **directed-complete partial order** (*DCPO*) or _predomain_ is a [[poset]] in which every [[directed set|directed]] [[subset]] has a [[join]].  

A _pointed DCPO_ or **complete partial order** (*CPO*) (or _inductive partial order_ (*IPO*) or _semidirected-complete partial order_ or _domain_ or *lift algebra*) is a DCPO with a [[bottom element]], equivalently a poset in which every semidirected subset has a join.
\end{definition}


## Properties

### The Scott topology

Every poset $P$ becomes a [[topological space]] under the [[Scott topology]], but this is particularly nice for DCPOs, so we review it.

A [[subset]] $A$ of a DCPO is Scott-[[open subset|open]] iff it's an [[upper subset]] and any directed subset of $P$ whose join belongs to $A$ must meet $A$; it\'s Scott-[[closed subset|closed]] iff it is a [[lower subset]] that is directed-complete in its own right.

The [[specialisation order]] of the Scott topology of a DCPO is its original order (but the Scott topology is finer than the [[specialisation topology]]).
