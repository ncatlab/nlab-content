Selection theory asks if given a [[multi-valued function]] $F\colon X \to Y$ does there exist a continuous selector $f\colon X \to Y$, i.e. a single-valued continuous function such that $f(x) \in F(x)$ for all $x \in X$. A selection theorem states that under certain assumptions on $X, Y, F$ there is indeed a selector. Normally, such assumptions include that $X$ is [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]], $Y$ is some subset of a [[topological vector space]], $F$ is lower semicontinuous (also called hemicontinuous), and $F(x)$ is [[convex set|convex]] for each $x \in X$.

## Selection theorems

\begin{theorem}[Michael selection theorem]
  Let $X$ be [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]], $Y$ a [[Banach space]], $F$ lower semicontinuous, and $F(x)$ nonempty, convex, and closed. Then $F$ admits a selector.
\end{theorem}
