A category is **balanced** if every morphism which is both [[monomorphism|monic]] and [[epimorphism|epic]] is an [[isomorphism]].

Any [[topos]] (in fact, any [[pretopos]]) is balanced, as are some algebraic categories such as [[Grp|the category of groups]] and any [[abelian category]].  However, the category of rings is not balanced ($Z\hookrightarrow Q$ is monic and epic but not iso). Topological categories are rarely balanced (the monic epics in $Top$ include for example all continuous bijections), although the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is.

If $Y$ is Hausdorff, then any $f: X \to Y$ with dense image is also epic.
