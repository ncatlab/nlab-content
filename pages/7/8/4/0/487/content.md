A category is **balanced** if every [[bimorphism]] (a morphism which is both [[monomorphism|monic]] and [[epimorphism|epic]]) is an [[isomorphism]].

Any [[topos]] (in fact, any [[pretopos]]) is balanced, as are some algebraic categories such as [[Grp|the category of groups]] and any [[abelian category]].  However, the category of rings is not balanced ($Z\hookrightarrow Q$ is monic and epic but not isic). Topological categories are rarely balanced (in $\Top$, for example, the bimorphisms are the continuous bijections), although the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is.
