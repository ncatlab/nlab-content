## Idea

Mirror symmetry between two [[Calabi-Yau variaties]] $X$ and $Y$ is a pair of [[isomorphism]]s between the N=2 super[[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] called _A-model_ and the _B-model_ attached to $X$ and $Y$. These superconformal field theories were introduced via a twisting procedure from a nonlinear [[sigma model]] by Witten; and in fact these twists are topological field theories. 

The mirror symmetry means more precisely that the A-model attached to $X$ is isomorphic as a N=1 superconformal field theory to the B-model attached to $Y$ and simultaneously the B-model attached to $X$ is isomorphic as a N=1 superconformal field theory to the A-model attached to $Y$. The topological A-model can be expressed in terms of [[symplectic geometry]] of a variety and the topological B-model can be expressed in terms of the [[algebraic geometry]] of a variety. [[category theory|Categorical]] expression of the A-model is the [[Fukaya category]] which can be understood as a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] representing the Lagrangean intersection theory on the underlying [[symplectic manifold]]; the categorical expression of the B-model is the stable $(\infty,1)$-category of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on the underlying complex algebraic variety. 

The expression of mirror symmetry via $(\infty,1)$-categories is equivalent to the SCFT formulation according to the theorems of [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and independently by [[Kevin Costello]] which reconstruct the quantum field theory from a [[Calabi-Yau A∞-category]]. Kontsevich introduced the categorical variant in 1994 under the name **homological mirror symmetry**  and used the [[A-infinity-category|A∞-categories]] as a model for stable $(\infty,1)$-categories in his work. 

The mirror symmetry conjecture roughly claims that every Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a mirror. In fact one considers (mirror symmetry for) degenerating families for Calabi-Yau 3-folds in large volume limit (what can be expressed precisely via the Gromov-Hausdorff metric). The appropriate definition of (an appropriate version of) the [[Fukaya category]] of a symplectic manifold is difficult to achieve in desired generality. 
Invariants/tools of Fukaya category include symplectic [[Floer homology]] and [[quantum cohomology]]. Mirror symmetry is related to the [[T-duality]] on each fiber of an associated Lagrangian fibration (Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture).
