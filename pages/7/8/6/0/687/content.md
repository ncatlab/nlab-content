## Definition

The [[(2,1)-category]] $Grpd$ is the [[2-category]] whose

* [[object]]s are [[small category|small]] [[groupoid]]s;

* [[morphism]]s are [[functor]]s;

* [[2-morphism]]s are [[natural transformation]]s, which are necessarily [[natural isomorphism]]s.

This is the full sub-2-category of [[Cat]] on those [[categories]] that are groupoids.

## Properties

### Presentation

One may regard $Gprd$ also just as a 1-category by ignoring the natural isomorphisms between functors. This 1-category may be equipped with the [[natural model structure on groupoids]] to provide a 1-categorical [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of the full $(2,1)$-category.
