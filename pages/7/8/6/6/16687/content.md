**Ho&#224;ng Xu&#226;n S&#237;nh** is a Vietnamese mathematician who was a student of [[Grothendieck]]. Her thesis was on *Gr-categories* (now more often called (weak) [[2-groups]]) and *Picard categories* (also called symmetric 2-groups, i.e. symmetric monoidal categories with all objects and morphisms invertible).

The version linked to above is a handwritten draft copy, with some annotations by someone (perhaps Grothendieck). A typed version does exist which does not contain the preliminary material in the first file. The date of the official thesis defense was 22 May 1975, with [[Jean-Louis Verdier]], [[Henri Cartan]], [[Laurent Schwartz]] and [[Michel Zisman]] as well as [[Alexander Grothendieck]] as the 'jury'. It was a 'doctorat d'&#233;tat'. The link to her thesis contains other material, including a collection of remarks by Grothendieck on her work as well as two papers by S&#237;nh related to the subject of her thesis:

The first appears to prove that every 2-group is equivalent to a strict 2-group arising from a crossed module.  The second calls a symmetric 2-group a *Picard category*, and calls a Picard category *restrained* if the [[braiding]] $B_{x,x} \colon x \otimes x \to x \otimes x$ is the identity for all objects $x$.  It then proves that every Picard category is equivalent to one arising from a 2-term chain complex of abelian groups.
