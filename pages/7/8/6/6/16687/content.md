**Ho&#224;ng Xu&#226;n S&#237;nh** is a Vietnamese mathematician who was a student of [[Grothendieck]]. Her thesis was on *Gr-categories* (now more often called (weak) [[2-groups]]) and *[[Picard groupoids|Picard category]]* (also called *[[symmetric 2-groups]]*, i.e. [[symmetric monoidal categories]] with all objects [[invertible object|invertible]] and all morphisms [[invertible morphism|invertible]]).

## Selected writings:

Early discussion of [[2-groups]]:

The version linked to above is a handwritten draft copy, with some annotations by someone (perhaps [[Grothendieck]]). A typed version does exist which does not contain the preliminary material in the first file. The date of the official thesis defense was 22 May 1975, with [[Jean-Louis Verdier]], [[Henri Cartan]], [[Laurent Schwartz]] and [[Michel Zisman]] as well as [[Alexander Grothendieck]] as the 'jury'. It was a 'doctorat d'&#233;tat'. The link to her thesis contains other material, including a collection of remarks by Grothendieck on her work as well as two papers by S&#237;nh related to the subject of her thesis:

* Hoàng Xuân Sính,  Gr-cat&eacute;gories strictes, *Acta Mathematica Vietnamica* **3** 2 (1978) 47-59 &lbrack;[pdf](https://pnp.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/lexmath/kuenzer/Hoang_Xuan_Sinh_Gr_categories_strictes.pdf)&rbrack;

* Hoàng Xuân Sính, Cat&eacute;gories de Picard restreintes, *Acta Mathematica Vietnamica* **7** 1 (1983) 117-122  &lbrack;[pdf](https://pnp.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/lexmath/kuenzer/Hoang_Xuan_Sinh_Categories_de_Picard_restreintes.pdf)&rbrack;

The first appears to prove that every 2-group is equivalent to a strict 2-group arising from a [[crossed module]].  The second calls a symmetric 2-group a *Picard category*, and calls a Picard category *restrained* if the [[braiding]] $B_{x,x} \colon x \otimes x \to x \otimes x$ is the identity for all objects $x$.  It then proves that every Picard category is equivalent to one arising from a 2-term chain complex of abelian groups.
