## Idea

Confinement (e.g [Espiru 94](#Espiru94)) is the (expected) phenomenon in [[Yang-Mills theory]] generally and especially in [[quantum chromodynamics]] that the fundamental [[quarks]], which the [[Yang-Mills theory|YM]]/[[QCD]]-[[Lagrangian density]] actually describes, must form [[baryon|baryonic]] [[bound state|bound states]] which are neutral under the color charge -- the [[mesons]] and [[hadron|hadrons]] ([[proton|protons]], [[neutron|neutrons]]). Hence confinement in particular concerns the emergence and existence of [[atomic nuclei]], hence of ordinary [[matter]], which is not manifest at all in the [[quark]]-model. 

Part of the issue is that confinement is a [[non-perturbative effect]] (e.g [Espiru 94](#Espiru94)) outside the range of validity of [[perturbative quantum field theory]].

## The open problem of confinement
 {#OpenProblem}

While [[experiment]] as well as [[lattice gauge theory]]-computer simulation clearly show that [[confinement]] takes place, a real theoretical understanding has been missing (though [[AdS-QCD]] is now on a good track). This is the _confinement problem_. The same problem from the point of view of [[mathematics]] is called the _[[mass gap problem|mass gap]] [Millenium Problem](quantization+of+Yang-Mills+theory#ReferencesNonperturbativeTheoryAndMassGap)_. A related problem is the _[flavor problem](flavor+problem#TheFlavorProblem)_.

The following is a list of quotes highlighting the open problem of confinement:

> many of the essential  properties that the theory $[$QCD$]$ is presumed to have, including  confinement, dynamical mass generation, and chiral symmetry  breaking, are only poorly understood. And apart from the low-lying bound states of heavy quarks, which we believe can be  described by a nonrelativistic Schroedinger equation, we are unable to derive from the basic theory even the grossest  features of the partticle spectrum, or of traditional strong  interaction phenomenology

> Because of the great importance of the standard model, and the central role it plays in our understanding of particle physics, it is unfortunate that, in one very important respect, we don’t really understand how it works. The problem lies in the sector dealing with the interactions of quarks and gluons, the sector known as Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD. We simply do not know for sure why quarks and gluons, which are the fundamental fields of the theory, don’t show up in the actual spectrum of the theory, as asymptotic particle states. There is wide agreement  about  what  must  be  happening  in  high  energy  particle  collisions:  the  formation of color electric flux tubes among quarks and antiquarks, and the eventual fragmentation of those flux tubes into mesons and baryons, rather than free quarks and gluons. But there is no general agreement about why this is happening, and that limitation exposes our general ignorance about the workings of non-abelian gauge theories in general, and QCD in particular, at large distance scales.

technique for answering nonperturbative questions, but to date there remain open questions that have not been answered.

>  The success of the technique does not remove the challenge of understanding the non-perturbative aspects of the theory. The two aspects are
deeply intertwined. The Lagrangian of QCD is written in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom which become apparent at large energy but remain hidden inside hadrons in the low-energy regime. This confinement property is related to the increase of $\alpha_s$ at low energy, but it has never been
demonstrated analytically. 

> We have clear indications of the confinement of quarks into hadrons from both experiments and lattice QCD. Computations of the heavy quark–antiquark potential, for example, display a linear behavior in the quark–antiquark distance, which cannot be obtained in pure perturbation theory. Indeed the two main characteristics of QCD: confinement and the appearance of nearly massless pseudoscalar mesons, emergent from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, are non-perturbative phenomena whose precise understanding continues to be a target of research.

> $[\cdots]$ the QCD Lagrangian does not by itself explain the data on strongly interacting matter, and it is not clear how the observed bound states, the hadrons, and their properties arise from QCD. Neither confinement  nor dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) is apparent in QCD’s lagrangian, yet they play a dominant role in determining the observable characteristics of QCD. The physics of strongly interacting matter is governed by emergent phenomena such as these, which can only be elucidated through the use of non-perturbative methods in QCD [4, 5, 6, 7]

> Experimentally, there is a large number of facts that lack a detailed qualitative and quantitative explanation. The most spectacular manifestation of our lack of theoretical understanding of QCD is the failure to observe the elementary degrees of freedom, quarks and gluons, as free asymptotic states (color con- finement) and the occurrence, instead, of families of massive mesons and baryons (hadrons) that form approximately linear Regge trajectories in the mass squared. The internal, partonic structure of hadrons, and nucleons in particular, is still largely mysterious. Since protons and neutrons form almost all the visible matter of the Universe, it is of basic importance to explore their static and dynamical properties in terms of quarks and gluons interacting according to QCD dynamics.

> Since 1973, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has been established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to solve QCD directly in an analytical manner, and many effective models of QCD have been used instead of QCD, but most models cannot be derived from QCD and its connection to QCD is unclear. To analyze nonperturbative QCD, the lattice QCD Monte Carlo simulation has been also used as a first-principle calculation of the strong interaction. However, it has several weak points. For example, the state information (e.g. the wave function) is severely limited, because lattice QCD is based on the path-integral formalism. Also, it is difficult to take the chiral limit, because zero-mass pions require infinite volume lattices. There appears a notorious "sign problem" at finite density.

> On the other hand, [[holographic QCD]] has a direct connection to QCD, and can be derived from QCD in some limit. In fact, [[holographic QCD]] is equivalent to infrared QCD in large $N_c$ and strong 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$, via gauge/gravity correspondence. Remarkably, holographic QCD is successful to reproduce many hadron phenomenology such as vector meson dominance, the KSRF relation, hidden local symmetry, the GSW model and the Skyrme soliton picture. Unlike lattice QCD simulations, holographic QCD is usually formulated in the chiral limit, and does not have the sign problem at finite density.

## Potential solutions

### Via Calorons
 {#ViaCalorons}

It has been argued that, after [[Wick rotation]], confinement may be derived from the behaviour of [[instantons]] ([Schaefer-Shuryak 96, section III D](#SchaeferShuryak96)), or rather their [[thermal field theory|positive temperature]]-incarnations as _[[calorons]]_, [Greensite 11, section 8.5](#Greensite11):

> it is natural to wonder if [[confinement]] could be derived from some [[semiclassical approximation|semiclassical]] treatment of [[Yang–Mills theory]] based on the [[instanton]] solutions of [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] [[gauge theories]]. The [[BPST instanton|standard]] [[instantons]], introduced by Belavin et al. ([40](BPTS-instanton#BelavinPolyakovSchwartzTyupkin75)), do not seem to work; their [[field strengths]] fall off too rapidly to produce the desired  magnetic  disorder  in  the  vacuum.  

> In  recent years, however, it has been realized that instanton solutions at [[thermal field theory|finite temperature]], known as _[[calorons]]_, might do the job. These caloron solutions were introduced independently by Kraan and van Baal ([41](caloron#KraanVanBaal98), [42](caloron#KraanVanBaal98b)) and Lee and Lu ([43](caloron#LeeLu98)) (KvBLL), and they have the remarkable property of containing [[monopole]] constituents which may, depending on the type of [[caloron]], be widely separated.

> $[...]$

> The [[caloron]] idea is probably the most promising current version of [[monopole]] [[confinement]] in pure non-abelian gauge theories, but it is  basically  (in certain [[gauge fixing|gauges]]) a superposition of [[monopoles]] with spherically  symmetric abelian fields, and this leads to the same questions raised in connection with monopole Coulomb gases.

### Via Skyrmions and D4-brane models

A good qualitative and moderate quantitative explanation of confinement in [[quantum chromodynamics]] is found in [[intersecting D-brane models]], specifically in the [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] which [[geometric engineering of QFT|geometrically engineers]] [[QCD]] on [[D4-D8 brane bound states]].

In this [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] for [[non-perturbative effect|strongly coupled]] [[QCD]] the [[hadrons]] in [[QCD]] correspond to [[string theory|string-theoretic]]-phenomena in the [[bulk field theory]]:

1. the [[mesons]] ([[bound states]] of 2 [[quarks]]) correspond to [[open strings]] in the bulk, whose two endpoints on the [[asymptotic boundary]] correspond to the two quarks

1. [[baryons]] ([[bound states]] of $N_c$ [[quarks]]) appear in two different but equivalent ([Sugimoto 16, 15.4.1](Ads/QCD#Sugimoto16)) guises:

   1. as [[wrapped brane|wrapped]] [[D4-branes]] with $N_c$ [[open strings]] connecting them to the [[D8-brane]]

      ([Witten 98b](Ads/QCD#Witten98b), [Gross-Ooguri 98, Sec. 5](Ads/QCD#GrossOoguri98), [BISY 98](Ads/QCD#BISY98), [CGS98](Ads/QCD#CGS98))

   1. as [[skyrmions]] 

      ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04, section 5.2](Ads/QCD#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05, section 3.3](Ads/QCD#SakaiSugimoto05), see [Bartolini 17](Ads/QCD#Bartolini17)).

Equivalently, these baryon states are the [[Yang-Mills instantons]] on the [[D8-brane]] giving the [[D4-D8 brane bound state]] ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04, 5.7](Ads/QCD#SakaiSugimoto04)) as a special case of the general situation for [[Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states]] (e.g. [Tong 05, 1.4](Dp-D%28p%2B4%29-brane+bound+state#Tong05)).

### In $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory via Seiberg-Witten theory
  {#InN2SYM}

While confinement in plain [[Yang-Mills theory]] is still waiting for mathematical formalization and [[proof]] (see [Jaffe-Witten](#JaffeWitten)), there is a variant of [[Yang-Mills theory]] with more [[symmetry]], namely [[supersymmetry]], where the phenomenon has been giving a decent argument, namely in [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] ([Seiberg-Witten 94](#SeibergWitten94)). 

Also a strategy for a proof for [[N=1 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] has been proposed, see [below](#ForN1SYMViaMTheoryOnG2Manifolds).

### In $\mathcal{N} = 1$ super Yang-Mills theory via M-theory on $G_2$-manifolds
 {#ForN1SYMViaMTheoryOnG2Manifolds}

An idea for a strategy towards a proof of confinement in [[N=1 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] via two different but conjecturally equivalent realizations as [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] has been given in [Atiyah-Witten 01, section 6](#AtiyahWitten01), review is in [Acharya-Gukov 04, section 5.3](#AcharyaGukov04).

The idea here is to consider a [[KK-compactification]] of [[M-theory]] on [[fibers]] which are [[G2-manifolds]] that locally around a special point 
are of the form

$$
  X_{1,\Gamma} 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \big( S^3 / \Gamma \big) \times Cone\big(S^3\big)
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{or}
  \phantom{AA}
  X_{2,\Gamma} 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  S^3 \times Cone\big(S^3/\Gamma\big)
$$

where 

* $\Gamma$ is a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] that [[action|acts]] canonically by left-multiplication on $S^3 \simeq $ [[SU(2)]];

* $Cone(\cdots)$ denotes the [[metric cone]] construction.

This means that $X_{1,\Gamma}$ is a [[smooth manifold]], but $X_{2,\Gamma}$, as soon as $\Gamma$ is not the [[trivial group]], $\Gamma \neq 1$, is an [[orbifold]] with an [[ADE singularity]].

Now the lore of [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] predicts that [[KK-compactification]]

1.  on $X_{1,\Gamma}$ yields a 4d theory without massless fields (since there are no massless modes on the [[covering space]] $S^3$ of $X_{1,\Gamma}$)

1. on the [[ADE-singularity]] $X_{2,\Gamma}$ yields [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[Yang-Mills theory]] in 4d coupled to [[chiral fermions]].

So in the first case a [[mass gap]] is manifest, while non-abelian gauge theory is not visible, while in the second case it is the other way around.

But if there were an argument that [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] is in fact equivalent for compactification both on $X_{1,\Gamma}$ and on $X_{2,\Gamma}$. To the extent that this is true, it looks like an argument that could demonstrate confinement in non-abelian 4d gauge theory.

This approach is suggested in [Atiyah-Witten 01, pages 84-85](#AtiyahWitten01). An argument that this equivalence is indeed the case is then provided in sections 6.1-6.4, based on an argument in [Atiyah-Maldacena-Vafa 00](#AtiyahMaldacenaVafa00)
