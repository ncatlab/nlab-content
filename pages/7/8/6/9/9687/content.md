## Idea

Confinement (e.g [Espiru 94](#Espiru94)) is the (expected) phenomenon in [[Yang-Mills theory]]/[[QCD]] that [[quark]]-excitations must form [[bound state|bound states]] which are neutral under the color charge -- such as the [[hadron|hadrons]] ([[proton|protons]], [[neutron|neutrons]]) and [[meson|mesons]].

Confinement is a [[non-perturbative effect]] (e.g [Espiru 94](#Espiru94)).

## Possible realizations

### In $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory via Seiberg-Wittern theory

While confinement in plain [[Yang-Mills theory]] is still waiting for mathematical formalization and [[proof]] (see [Jaffe-Witten](#JaffeWitten)), there is a variant of [[Yang-Mills theory]] with more [[symmetry]] where the phenomenon has been demonstrated, namely in [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] ([Seiberg-Witten 94](#SeibergWitten94)).

### In $\mathcal{N} = 1$ super Yang-Mills theory via M-theory on $G_2$-manifolds
 {#ForN1SYMViaMTheoryOnG2Manifolds}

An idea for a strategy towards a proof of confinement in [[N=1 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] via two different but conjecturally equivalent realizations as [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] has been given in [Atiyah-Witten 01, section 6](#AtiyahWitten01), review is in [Acharya-Gukov 04, section 5.3](#AcharyaGukov04).

The idea here is to consider a [[KK-compactification]] of [[M-theory]] on [[fibers]] which are [[G2-manifolds]] that locally around a special point 
are of the form

$$
  X_{1,\Gamma} 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \big( S^3 / \Gamma \big) \times Cone\big(S^3\big)
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{or}
  \phantom{AA}
  X_{2,\Gamma} 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  S^3 \times Cone\big(S^3/\Gamma\big)
$$

where 

* $\Gamma$ is a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] that [[action|acts]] canonically by left-multiplication on $S^3 \simeq $ [[SU(2)]];

* $Cone(\cdots)$ denotes the [[metric cone]] construction.

This means that $X_{1,\Gamma}$ is a [[smooth manifold]], but $X_{2,\Gamma}$, as soon as $\Gamma$ is not the [[trivial group]], $\Gamma \neq 1$, is an [[orbifold]] with an [[ADE singularity]].

Now the lore of [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] predicts that [[KK-compactification]]

1.  on $X_{1,\Gamma}$ yields a 4d theory without massless fields (since there are no massless modes on the [[covering space]] $S^3$ of $X_{1,\Gamma}$)

1. on the [[ADE-singularity]] $X_{2,\Gamma}$ yields [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[Yang-Mills theory]] in 4d coupled to [[chiral fermions]].

So in the first case a [[mass gap]] is manifest, while non-abelian gauge theory is not visible, while in the second case it is the other way around.

But is there were an argument that [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] is in fact equivalent for compactification both on $X_{1,\Gamma}$ and on $X_{2,\Gamma}$. To the extent that this is true, it looks like an argument that could demonstrate confinement in non-abelian 4d gauge theory.

This approach is suggested in [Atiyah-Witten 01, pages 84-85](#AtiyahWitten01). An argument that this equivalence is indeed the case is then provided in sections 6.1-6.4, based on an argument in [Atiyah-Maldacena-Vafa 00](#AtiyahMaldacenaVafa00)
