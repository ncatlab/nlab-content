
## Idea 

A __homography__ or a __projective transformation__ is an automorphism of a projective space: a map from a projective space $P(V)$ to itself which lifts to a linear automorphism of $V$. More generally, a homography
$P(V)\to P(W)$ is a morphism of projective spaces which lift to a linear isomorphism $V\to W$.

In the synthetic approach, a homography is a finite composition of [[perspectivities]]. 

For real projective spaces of dimension at least 2 this is the same as a collineation; in general collineations are slightly more general.
