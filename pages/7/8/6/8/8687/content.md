## Definition

Working over a [[commutative ring]] $R$, recall that a _unital_ or _coaugmented_ [[coalgebra]] is an $R$-[[coalgebra]] $(C, \Delta: C \to C \otimes_R C, \epsilon: C \to R)$ equipped with a coalgebra map $u: R \to C$. Abusing notation, denote $u(1) \in C$ by $1$. 

### Primitive element in a coalgebra

An element  $x$ in a [[coalgebra]] $C$ is __primitive__ if $\Delta(x) = 1\otimes x + x\otimes 1$. This condition implies $\epsilon(x) = 0$. 

This notion generalizes straightforwardly to unital [[corings]] over $R$ and even more generally to any [[comonoid object|unital comonoid object]] in a [[CMon-enriched monoidal category]] (see below).

### Primitive element in a comodule

Let $N$ be a [[comodule]] over $C$, with co-action map $\Psi \colon N \longrightarrow C \otimes_R N$. Then an element $n \in N$ is called a **primitive element** or **[[coinvariant]]** if $\Psi(n) = 1 \otimes n$.

The $R$-module $prim(N)$ of primitive elements of $N$ is [[natural isomorphism|naturally]] to 

1. the module of comodule homomorphisms out of $R$ into $N$

   $$
     prim(N) \simeq Hom_{C}(R,N)
     \,.
   $$

1. the [[cotensor product]] of $N$ with $R$

   $$
     prim(N) \simeq R \Box_R N
     \,.
   $$

### Object of primitive elements of a unital comonoid in a $CMon$-enriched monoidal category 

Let $(C,\Delta,\epsilon)$ be a [[comonoid object|unital comonoid object]] in a [[CMon-enriched monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C},\otimes,I)$. The object $P$ of primitive elements of $C$ is defined if it exists, as the [[equalizer]] in this diagram:

\begin{tikzcd}
P \arrow[r, "i"] & C \arrow[rr, "\Delta", shift left] \arrow[rr, "1 \otimes \eta + \eta \otimes 1"', shift right] &  & C \otimes C
\end{tikzcd}

\begin{proposition}
If the unital comonoid $C$ admits an object $P$ of primitive elements, the [[commutative rig]] $\mathcal{C}[I,I]$ verifies $2 \neq 1$, and the homsets $\mathcal{C}$[A,B] are [[multiplicatively cancellative modules]] over $\mathcal{C}[I,I]$, we then have:

\begin{tikzcd}
P \arrow[r, "i"] \arrow[rd, "0"'] & C \arrow[d, "\epsilon"] \\
                                  & I                      
\end{tikzcd}

\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
In this diagram, the path from $C$ to $C$ by the upper square (with below side equal to $\Delta$) is equal to the identity and the two paths from $P$ to $C \otimes C$ are equal:

\begin{tikzcd}
                 & {} \arrow[rr, "1 \otimes \epsilon", no head] \arrow[d]                                                                       &  & {}                             \\
P \arrow[r, "i"] & C \arrow[rr, "\Delta", shift left] \arrow[rr, "1 \otimes \eta + \eta \otimes 1"', shift right] \arrow[d, "\epsilon"] &  & C \otimes C \arrow[u, no head] \\
                 & I                                                                                                                            &  &                               
\end{tikzcd}

We thus have that:
$$i = i;\Delta;1 \otimes \epsilon = i;(1 \otimes \eta + \eta \otimes 1);(1 \otimes \epsilon)$$

and:
$$
i;\epsilon = i;\Delta;1 \otimes \epsilon;\epsilon = i;(1 \otimes \eta + \eta \otimes 1);(1 \otimes \epsilon);\epsilon$$

$$
 = i;(1 \otimes \eta);(1 \otimes \epsilon);\epsilon + i;(\eta \otimes 1);(1 \otimes \epsilon);\epsilon
$$

We then have:

$\mathcal{C}[P,I]$ being a multiplicatively cancellative $\mathcal{C}[I,I]$-module, if $i;\epsilon \neq 0$, we would have that $1 = 2$ in $\mathcal{C}[I,I]$ which is false, therefore $i;\epsilon = 0$.
\end{proof}

## Properties

### Primitives in a Hopf algebra 

A straightforward calculation shows that the module of primitive elements in a [[Hopf algebra]] $H$ (or even in a [[bialgebra]] $H$) is a Lie subalgebra of the underlying [[Lie algebra]] of $H$ (whose bracket is the algebra [[commutator]]). 
Thus, taking primitive elements yields a functor 

$$P: HopfAlg \to LieAlg$$ 

(and of course we have more generally a functor $P: BiAlg \to LieAlg$ which is an extension along the full inclusion $HopfAlg \to BiAlg$). 

For a Lie algebra $L$, let $U(L)$ be its [[universal enveloping algebra]]: 

$$U(L) = T(L)/I$$ 

where $I$ is the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form $x y - y x - [x, y]$ where $x, y \in L$. This carries a bialgebra structure whose comultiplication $\delta: U(L) \to U(L) \otimes U(L)$ is uniquely determined by the rule $\delta(x) = 1 \otimes x + x \otimes 1$ for $x \in L$. Since this says $x \in L$ is primitive, the counit $\epsilon: U(L) \to R$ is forced to be the algebra map such $\epsilon(x) = 0$ for all $x \in L$, and also the Hopf antipode is uniquely determined: $\sigma(x) = -x$ for $x \in L$. 

The following proposition is entirely straightfoward:

###### Proposition 
The functor $U: LieAlg \to BiAlg$ is [[left adjoint]] to the functor $P: BiAlg \to LieAlg$. 
=-- 

This result is essentially tautologous and holds for any commutative ring of arbitrary characteristic. (This despite the fact that the $U(L)$ as defined above is not as well-behaved in nonzero characteristic as one might like; e.g. the [[PBW theorem]] fails.) More information on this adjunction may require more restrictive hypotheses: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
For $R = k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]], the [[adjunction unit|unit]] $L \to P U(L)$ is an [[isomorphism]]. 
=-- 

An immediate consequence is that for such ground fields $k$, the functor $U: LieAlg \to BiAlg$ is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]]. Of course, $U$ lands in the full subcategory of cocommutative Hopf algebras, which is exactly the category of [[group objects]] in the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[cocommutative coalgebras]]. 

The [[Milnor-Moore theorem]] gives further information: for Hopf algebras over a field of characteristic zero, the counit $U P(H) \to H$ is a monomorphism, and an isomorphism in case $H$ satisfies a suitable conilpotency condition. 

(More needs to be added.)
