##Idea

If we take a [[pointed set|pointed space]] $(X,x_0)$, then its *reduced suspension* $\Sigma X$ is obtained by taking  the cylinder $I\times X$ and identifying the subspace $\{0,1\}\times X\cup I\times \{x_0\}$ to a point.  

(Think of crushing the two ends of the cylinder and the line through the base point to a point.) 

##Definition
For a pointed space $(X,x_0)$,
$$\Sigma X = (I\times X)/\{0,1\}\times X\cup I\times \{x_0\}$$


##Remark

This can also be thought of as forming $S^1\wedge X$ the  [[smash product]] of the circle (based at some point, thought of as $1$ in the unit circle in the complex plane) with $X$.
