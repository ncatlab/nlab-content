## Idea
 {#Idea}

For a [[pointed topological space]] $(X, x)$, its *reduced suspension* $\Sigma (X,x) $ is obtained from the plain [[suspension]] 

$$
  \mathrm{S}X
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{
    X \,\times\, [-1,\, +1]
  }{
    \left(
    \begin{array}{c}  
      X \times \{-1\}\mathrlap{,\,}
      \\
      X \times \{+1\}
    \end{array}
    \right)
  }
$$ 

of the [[underlying]] [[topological space]] $X$ by [[quotient space|collapsing]] the [[meridian]] through the [[basepoint]] $x$ itself to a point --- this making $\Sigma(X,x)$ itself a [[pointed topological space]] with basepoint the [[equivalence class]] of that meridian $mer(x)$:

$$
  \Sigma (X,x) 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \frac{
    \mathrm{S}X
  }{ \{x\} \times [-1,1] }
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;\;
  Top^{\ast/}
  \,.
$$

(Notice that this identifies in particular also the two [[antipode|antipodal]] "poles" of the plain suspension.)

If $X$ admits the structure of a [[CW-complex]] then, under passage to the [[classical homotopy category]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] (cf.  [here](classical+model+structure+on+topological+spaces#ModelstructureOnPointedTopologicalSpaces)) this construction models the [[homotopy pushout]] of the [[terminal object|terminal]] map $(X,x) \to (\ast,pt)$ along itself, which explains its prevalence in [[homotopy theory]] (especially in [[stable homotopy theory]], see also at *[[suspension spectrum]]*).

Moreover, in this case of [[CW-complexes]] the [[underlying]] space of $\Sigma (X,x)$ (i.e. forgetting its [[basepoint]]) is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the plain [[suspension]] $\mathrm{S} X$ of the [[underlying]] space $X$ of $(X,x)$. In this sense, reduced suspension in the context of [[homotopy theory]] may be understood as just being plain suspension but with basepoints taken into account.


## Definition
 {#Definition}

For $(X,x)$ a [[pointed topological space]], then its *reduced suspension* $\Sigma X$ is equivalently the following:

* obtained from the standard [[cylinder]] $I\times X$ ([[product topological space]] with the [[closed interval]] $I = [0,1]$) by identifying the [[subspace]] $(\{0,1\}\times X) \cup (I\times \{x\})$ to a point, i.e. the [[quotient space]] ([this example](quotient+space#QuotientBySubspace))

  $$
     (X \times [0,1])/ ( ( X \times \{0,1\} ) \cup ([0,1] \times \{x\}) )
  $$  

  (Think of crushing the two ends of the cylinder and the line through the base point to a point.) 

* obtained from the plain [[suspension]] 

  $$
    S X = (X \times [0,1])/( X \times \{0\}, X \times \{1\})
  $$ 

  of $X$ by passing to the [[quotient space]] which collapses $\{x\} \times I$ to a point ([this example](quotient+space#QuotientBySubspace))

  $$
    \Sigma X \simeq S X / (  \{x\} \times I )
  $$

  For the purposes of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory typically it does not matter whether one evaluates on the standard suspension or the reduced suspension. For example for [[topological K-theory]] since $\{x\} \times I$ is a [[contractible topological space|contractible]] [[closed subspace]], then [this prop.](topological+vector+bundle#VectorBundlesOverQuotientByContractibleSubspaceAreEquivalentToVectorBundlesOnTotalSpace) says that [[topological vector bundles]] do not see a difference as long as $X$ is a [[compact Hausdorff space]].



* obtained from the [[reduced cylinder]] by collapsing the two ends, i.e. the [[cofiber]]

  $$
    \Sigma X \simeq cofib(X \vee X \to X \wedge (I_+))
  $$

* the [[mapping cone]] in [[pointed topological spaces]] formed with respect to the [[reduced cylinder]] $X \wedge (I_+)$ of the map $X \to \ast$;

* the [[smash product]] $S^1\wedge X$, of $X$ with the [[circle]] (based at some point) with $X$.

  $$
    \Sigma X \simeq S^1 \wedge X
    \,.
  $$


## Properties

### Relation to suspension

For [[CW-complexes]] $X$ that are also [[pointed topological space|pointed]], with the point identified with a 0-cell, then their reduced suspension is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary suspension: $\Sigma X \simeq S X$.

### Cogroup structure

[[suspensions are H-cogroup objects]]

## Example

### Spheres

Up to [[homeomorphism]], the reduced suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere

$$
  \Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$
