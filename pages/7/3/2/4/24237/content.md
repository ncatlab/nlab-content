on [[infinity-groups|$\infty$-groups]] in [[homotopy type theory]].


> **Abtract.** We present a development of the theory of [[higher groups]], including [[infinity-groups]] and [[connective spectra|connective]] [[spectra]], in [[homotopy type theory]]. An [[infinity-group|infinity group]] is simply the [[loops]] in a [[pointed]], [[connected]] [[type]], where the [[group]] structure comes from the structure inherent in the [[identity types]] of [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]]. We investigate ordinary [[groups]] from this viewpoint, as well as [[n-group|higher dimensional groups]] and groups that can be [[delooped]] more than once. A major result is the stabilization theorem, which states that if an [[n-type]] can be [[delooped]] $n+2$ times, then it is an [[infinite loop space|infinite loop type]]. Most of the results have been formalized in the [[Lean]] [[proof assistant]].
