__Kim Lin Chew__ is an [[algebra|algebraist]] with main interests in [[ring]] theory. Among his main works, he studied quotient/localization constructions, including in an approach via modular closure operators (including analogues of [[Lawvere-Tierney topologies]] in the context of the abelian categories of modules).
