## Idea

The [[sphere]] of [[dimension]] 7.

This is one of the [[parallelizable manifold|parallelizable]] spheres, as such corresponds to the [[octonions]] among the [[division algebras]], being the manifold of unit octonions, and is the only one of these which does not carry ([[Lie group|Lie]]) [[group]] structure but just [[Moufang loop]] structure.


## Properties



### Quaternionic Hopf fibration
 {#QuaternionicHopfFibration}

The 7-sphere participates in the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]], the analog of the complex [[Hopf fibration]] with the field of [[complex numbers]] replaced by the division ring of [[quaternions]] or Hamiltonian numbers $\mathbb{H}$.

$$
  \array{
    S^3 &\hookrightarrow& S^7
    \\
    && \downarrow^\mathrlap{p}
    \\
    && S^4 &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B} SU(2)
  }
$$

Here the idea is that $S^7$ can be construed as $\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{H}^2: {|x|}^2 + {|y|}^2 = 1\}$, with $p$ mapping $(x, y)$ to $x/y$ as an element in the [[projective line]] $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{H}) \cong S^4$, with each [[fiber]] a [[torsor]] parametrized by quaternionic [[scalars]] $\lambda$ of unit [[norm]] (so $\lambda \in S^3$).  This canonical $S^3$-bundle (or $SU(2)$-bundle) is classified by a map $S^4 \to \mathbf{B} SU(2)$.

###### Proposition
**([[coset space]] of [[Spin(7)]] by [[G2]] is [[7-sphere]])**

Consider the canonical [[action]] of [[Spin(7)]] on the [[unit sphere]] in $\mathbb{R}^8$ (the [[7-sphere]]),

1. This action is is [[transitive action|transitive]];

1. the [[stabilizer group]] of any point on $S^7$ is [[G2]];

1. all [[G2]]-subgroups of [[Spin(7)]] arise this way, and are all [[conjugate subgroup|conjugate]] to each other.

Hence the [[coset space]] of [[Spin(7)]] by [[G2]] is the [[7-sphere]]

$$
  S^7
  \;\simeq_{diff}\;
  Spin(7)/G_2
  \,.
$$

Other coset realizations of the usual [[differentiable manifold|differentiable]] 7-sphere ([Choquet-Bruhat, DeWitt-Morette 00, p. 288](#Choquet-Bruhat+DeWitt-Morette00)):

* $S^7 \simeq_{diff} $ [[Spin(6)]]$/SU(3) \simeq_{iso} SU(4)/SU(3)$ (by [this Prop.](sphere#OddDimSphereAsSpecialUnitaryCoset));

* $S^7 \simeq_{diff}  Spin(5)/SU(2)$ ([Awada-Duff-Pope 83](#AwadaDuffPope83), [Duff-Nilsson-Pope 83](#DuffNilssonPope83))

These three coset realizations of 'squashed' 7-spheres together with a fourth

* $S^7 \simeq_{diff}  Spin(8)/Spin(7)$,

the realization of the 'round' 7-sphere, may be seen jointly as resulting from the 8-dimensional representations of even [[Clifford algebras]] in 5, 6, 7, and 8 dimensions (see [#Baez](Baez)) and as such related to the four [[normed division algebras]]. 



The following gives an [[exotic 7-sphere]]:

* $S^7 \simeq_{homeo} Sp(1)\backslash Sp(2)/Sp(1)$ ([[Gromoll-Meyer sphere]])

### Exotic 7-spheres

A celebrated result of Milnor is that $S^7$ admits [[exotic smooth structures]] (see at _[[exotic 7-sphere]]_), i.e., there are [[smooth manifold]] structures on the [[topological manifold]] $S^7$ that are not [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the standard smooth structure on $S^7$. More structurally, considering smooth structures up to [[orientation|oriented]] diffeomorphism, the different smooth structures form a [[monoid]] under a (suitable) operation of [[connected sum]], and this monoid is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/(28)$. With the notable possible exception of $n = 4$ (where the question of existence of exotic 4-spheres is wide open), exotic spheres first occur in dimension $7$. This phenomenon is connected to the [[h-cobordism theorem]] (the monoid of smooth structures is identified with the monoid of h-cobordism classes of oriented [[homotopy spheres]]). 

One explicit construction of the smooth structures is given as follows (see [Milnor 1968](#Mil2)). Let $W_k$ be the algebraic variety in $\mathbb{C}^5$ defined by the equation 

$$z_1^{6 k - 1} + z_2^3 + z_3^2 + z_4^2 + z_5^2 = 0$$ 

and $S_\epsilon \subset \mathbb{C}^5$ a sphere of small radius $\epsilon$ centered at the origin. Then each of the $28$ smooth structures on $S^7$ is represented by an intersection $W_k \cap S_\epsilon$, as $k$ ranges from $1$ to $28$. These manifolds sometimes go by the name _Brieskorn manifolds_ or [[Brieskorn sphere]]s[^1]. 

[^1]: Not surprisingly, these exotic spheres are also called _Milnor spheres_. 

### $G_2$-structure
 {#G2Structure}

Let $\phi_0 \in \Omega^3(\mathbb{R}^7)$ be the [[associative 3-form]] and let 

$$
  \Phi_0 \in \Omega^4(\mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{R}^7)
$$

be given by

$$
  \Phi_0 = d x_0 \wedge \phi_0 + \star \phi_0
$$

(where $x_0$ denotes the canonical coordinate on the first factor of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\phi_0$ is pulled back along the projection to $\mathbb{R}^7$)
.

By construction this is its own [[Hodge dual]]

$$
  \Phi = \star \Phi
  \,.
$$

This implies that as we restrict $\Phi_0$ to 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^8 - \{0\} \simeq \mathbb{R} \times S^7
$$

then there is a unique 3-form 

$$
  \phi \in \Omega^3(S^7)
$$

on the 7-sphere such that

$$
  \Phi_0 = r^3 \wedge \phi + r^4 \star_{S^7} \phi
  \;\;\;\; (on \; \mathbb{R}^8 - \{0\})
  \,.
$$

This 3-form $\phi$ defines a [[G2-structure]] on $S^7$. It is _nearly parallel_ in that

$$
  d \phi = 4 \star \phi
  \,.
$$
