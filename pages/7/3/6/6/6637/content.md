## Definition

For $G$ a [[group]], the **outer automorphism group** $Out(G)$ is the [[quotient]] of the [[automorphism group]] by the [[normal subgroup]] of [[inner automorphism]]s:

$$
  Out(G) := Aut(G)/Inn(G)
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### As a truncation of the automorphism 2-group

Write 

$$
  AUT(G) := Aut_{Grpd}(\mathbf{B}G)
$$

for the [[automorphism 2-group]] of $G$. This is the [[strict 2-group]] coming from the [[crossed module]]

$$
  G \stackrel{Ad}{\to} Aut(G)
  \,.
$$

Therefore the [[truncated|0-truncation]] of $AUT(G)$ is $Out(G)$:

$$
  Out(G) \simeq \tau_0 AUT(G)
  \,.
$$

This perspective generalizes to the notion of [[outer automorphism ∞-group]].

## Examples

The connected components of the [[subgroup]] of outer automorphisms of the a [[super Poincaré group]] which fixes the underlying [[Poincaré group]] is known as the _[[R-symmetry group]]_ in [[supersymmetry]].
