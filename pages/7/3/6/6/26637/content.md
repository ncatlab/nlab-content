Symvain Douteau is a maitre de conférence at _Université Paris-cité_, at [[IRIF]].

His main research is on the homotopy theory of stratified spaces. "This includes stratified homotopy theory itself, but also its applications to the study of classical invariants of stratified spaces, such as (generalised) [[intersection cohomology]], or exit-paths (infinity)-categories; see the entry on [[stratified spaces]]
