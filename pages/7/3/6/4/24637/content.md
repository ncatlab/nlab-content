Enriched sheaf theory has been introduced in

* F. Borceux, C. Quinteiro, _A theory of enriched sheaves_, Cahiers Topologie Géom. Différentielle Catég. 37 (1996), no. 2, 145--162 [MR1394507](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1394507)

They consider a locally finitely presentable symmetrical monoidal closed category $\mathcal{V}$ and a small $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category $\mathcal{C}$. The category $[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V}]$ of $\mathcal{V}$-valued $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors on the dual of $\mathcal{C}$ is considered as a category of enriched presheaves.
Axioms for $\mathcal{V}$-enriched Grothendieck topologies are introduced in terms of $\mathcal{V}$-subfunctors of representable functors (one could say $\mathcal{V}$-sieves). The main result of the article is a bijection between reflective $\mathcal{V}$-[[enriched localization]]s of $[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V}]$ preserving finite limits and $\mathcal{V}$-enriched Grothendieck topologies on $\mathcal{C}$ and also a bijection with universal $\mathcal{V}$-closure operations. 

This is a generalization of a [[Gabriel-Popescu theorem]] and of a characterization of Grothendieck topoi as left exact reflective localizations of presheaf categories. 

[[Gabriel filter]]s (Gabriel topologies) are the case of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched Grothendieck topologies when the enrichment is over the category of abelian groups.

Sufficient conditions when the base change of enriching subcategory commutes with sheafification are studied in
