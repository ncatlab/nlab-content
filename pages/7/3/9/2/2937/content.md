The construction of a [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra can be generalized in several ways. One of them is to generalize it to [[Lie algebroid]]s and, slightly more general, to the [[Lie-Rinehardt algebra]]s. This leads to the universal enveloping algebroids. Some standard theorems like the PBW theorem generalize to some extend to this context.
