## Disambiguation

Bishop introduced the [[principles of omniscience]] for the [[natural numbers]] to show that certain results in pointwise [[analysis]] could not be constructive, by showing that these results implied a principle of omniscience. There are similar axioms in analysis for various notions of [[real numbers]] which all imply the principles of omniscience for natural numbers, called the **analytic principles of omniscience**. These include

* The [[analytic limited principle of omniscience]]

* The [[analytic weak limited principle of omniscience]]

* The [[analytic lesser limited principle of omniscience]]

* The [[analytic Markov's principle]]
