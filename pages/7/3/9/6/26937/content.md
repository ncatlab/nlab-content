[Bishop 1967](#Bishop67)
introduced the [[principles of omniscience]] for the [[natural numbers]] to show that certain results in pointwise [[analysis]] could not be [[constructive mathematics|constructive]], by showing that these results implied a *[[principle of omniscience]]*. There are similar [[axioms]] in analysis for various notions of [[real numbers]] which all imply the principles of omniscience for natural numbers, called the **analytic principles of omniscience**. These include:

* the [[analytic limited principle of omniscience]],

* the [[analytic weak limited principle of omniscience]],

* the [[analytic lesser limited principle of omniscience]],

* the [[analytic Markov's principle]].
