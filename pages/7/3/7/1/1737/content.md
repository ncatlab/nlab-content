## Idea

Computer science studies [[programs]] and languages to express them, as well as the operation, application and design of computers and computer networks. This includes aspects relating to [[models for concurrency|concurrency]], [[semantics]] of [[programming languages]], and aspects of [[mathematical logic]]. 


From the [[nPOV]], computer science is part of the [[computational trinity]], together with [[logic]] and [[category theory]].
