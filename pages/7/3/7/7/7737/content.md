## Idea

The term *stratified space* usually refers to a [[topological space]] equipped with the structure of a [[stratification]], which decomposes the space into subspaces called *strata*. Often strata are "nice" in some sense (for instance, one may require strata to be manifolds, while the stratified space itself need not be a manifold), and the way that strata are linked together is controlled by additional conditions. More generally, stratified spaces may refer to any notion of [[space|spaces]] equipped with some type of stratification structure.

Examples are ubiquitous: they include [[polyhedra]], [[cell complex|cell complexes]], [[algebraic varieties]], [[orbit spaces]] of many [[group]] [[actions]] on manifolds, [[mapping cylinders]] of maps between manifolds, and [[moduli stack of formal groups|moduli stacks of formal groups]] stratified by [[height of a formal group|height of formal groups]].

## Variants

There are many different definitions of stratifications on spaces:

* stratifications from [[filtered topological space|filtrations]],
* [[poset-stratified space|poset-stratifications]],
* [[Whitney stratifications]] (see e.g. [Wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_conditions)),
* [[Thom-Mather stratifications]] (see e.g. [Wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom%E2%80%93Mather_stratified_space)),
* [[stratifold|stratifolds]],
* [[orbifold|orbifolds]],
* homotopical stratifications (as developed by [Quinn](#Quinn)),
* conically smooth stratifications (as developed by [Ayala-Francis-Tanaka](#AFT)),
* ...etc.

## Basic features

### Stratification structures

Most of the above variants share the same basic structure, captured by the following definitions.

\begin{terminology} Given a decomposition $f$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ into [[subspace#topological_subspaces|subspaces]] (denoted, in the following, by lower-case letters such as $s$), the *exit path preorder* $\mathsf{Exit}(f)$ of $f$ is the preorder of subspaces $s$ in $f$ with a generating arrow $s \to r$ whenever the closure of $r$ intersects $s$ non-trivially.
\end{terminology}

\begin{defn} A **stratification** $f$ on $X$ is a decomposition of $X$ such that $\mathsf{Exit}(f)$ is a poset.
\end{defn}

The subspaces in a stratification are also called *strata*. The opposite poset $\mathsf{Exit}(f)^{\mathrm{op}}$ is also called the *entrance path poset* and denoted by $\mathsf{Entr}(f)$.

\begin{rmk} Given a stratification $f$ on $X$, there is a map $X \to \mathrm{Exit}(f)$ mapping points $x \in s$ to $s \in \mathrm{Exit}(f)$, which is sometimes called the **characteristic map** of $f$, and (abusing notation) denoted by $f : X \to \mathrm{Exit}(f)$.
\end{rmk}

The characteristic map need not be continuous in general (unless the stratification is locally finite, see the next remark); it is, however, continuous on the preimage of any finite [[full functor|full]] subposet of the exit path poset. It is often convenient to construct stratifications by constructing their characteristic map.

\begin{example} *(Poset stratifications).* Let $X$ be a space, $P$ a poset, and $f : X \to P$ a continuous map (in other words, $f$ is a $P$-[[poset-stratified space|stratification of $X$]]). This determines a stratification $\mathrm{c}(f)$ of $X$ whose strata are the connected components of the preimages $f^{-1}(x)$, $x \in P$. The map $f$ factors uniquely through the characteristic map $\mathrm{c}(f) : X \to \mathsf{Exit}(\mathrm{c}(f))$ by a [[conservative functor|conservative]] poset map $\mathsf{Exit}(\mathrm{c}(f)) \to P$. (Such (characteristic,conservative)-factorizations are essentially unique.)
\end{example}

 The example shows that any poset-stratification determines a unique stratification. However, many poset-stratifications may determine the same stratification in this way.

\begin{example} *(Filtered spaces).* Any filtered space $X_0 \subset X_1 \subset ... \subset X_n$ in which $X_i$ is a closed subspace of $X_{i+1}$ defines a continuous map $X \to [n] = (0 \to 1 \to ... \to n)$ mapping points in $X_{i+1} \setminus X_{i}$ to $i$, and thus a stratification by the previous example. As a concrete instance of this example, the filtration by skeleta of any [[cell complex]] defines the "stratification by cells" in this way.
\end{example}

\begin{example} *(Trivial stratification).* Every topological space $U$ is trivially a stratification with a single stratum $U$.
\end{example}

\begin{rmk} *(Continuity of characteristic map).* Let $(X,f)$ be a stratified space. One says that the stratification $f$ is "locally finite" if each stratum $s$ of $f$ has an open neighborhood in $X$ which only contains finitely many strata. (If $(X,f)$ satisfies the frontier condition, see next remark, then, equivalently, $(X,f)$ is locally finite iff each point $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood intersecting only finitely many strata.) If $f$ is locally finite, then the characteristic map $f : X \to \mathsf{Exit}(f)$ is a [[continuous map]].
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk} *(Openness of characteristic map).* Let $(X,f)$ be a stratified space. One says the stratification $f$ satisfies the "frontier condition" (or, as an adjective, that it is "frontier-constructible") if, for any two strata $s, r$, the closure $\overline r$ intersects $s$ non-trivially, then $s \subset \overline r$. The stratification $f$ is frontier-constructible iff the characteristic map $f : X \to \mathsf{Exit}(f)$ is an [[open map]].
\end{rmk}

 It is generally very reasonable to assume stratifications to be locally finite and frontier-constructible.

### The category of stratifications

\begin{defn} A **stratified map** $F : (X,f) \to (Y,g)$ of stratified spaces is a continuous map $F : X \to Y$ which factors through the characteristic maps $f$ and $g$ by a necessarily unique map, denoted by $\mathsf{Exit}(F) : \mathsf{Exit}(f) \to \mathsf{Exit}(g)$.
\end{defn}

 Stratified spaces and their maps form the category $\mathbf{Strat}$ of stratification. The construction of exit path posets yields a functor $\mathsf{Exit} : \mathbf{Strat} \to \mathbf{Pos}$ (dually, using $(-)^{\mathrm{op}} : \mathbf{Pos} \to \mathbf{Pos}$ one obtains the entrance path poset functor $\mathsf{Entr} : \mathbf{Strat} \to \mathbf{Pos}$). The functor has a right inverse, as follows.

\begin{defn} Every poset $P$ has a **classifying stratification** $\parallel P \parallel$ (also called the *stratified realization* of $P$), whose underlying space is the classifying space $|P|$ of $P$ (i.e. the [[geometric realization|realization]] of the [[nerve]] of $P$), and whose characteristic map is the map $|P| \to P$ that maps $|P^{\leq x}| \setminus |P^{\lt x}|$ to $x$ (here, the full subposets $P^{\leq x} = \{y \leq x\}$ and $P^{\lt x} = \{y \lt x\}$ of $P$ are the "lower" resp. "strict lower closures" of an element $x$ in $P$). Moreover, given a poset map $F : P \to Q$, the realization of its nerve yields a stratified map $\parallel F\parallel : \parallel P\parallel \to \parallel Q \parallel$. We obtain a functor $\parallel -\parallel : \mathbf{Pos} \to \mathbf{Strat}$.
\end{defn}

Every classifying stratification is frontier-constructible.

It makes sense to further terminologically distinguish maps of stratifications as follows.

\begin{terminology} *(Types of stratified maps).* Let $F : (X,f) \to (Y,g)$ be a stratified map. The stratified map $F$ is called:

* a **substratification** if $F : X \to Y$ is a subspace and $\mathsf{Exit}(F)$ is [[conservative functor|conservative]]; if, moreover, $X = g^{-1} \circ \mathsf{Exit}(F) \circ f (X)$ then one says the substratification is **constructible**
* a **coarsening** if $F : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism (to emphasize the opposite process, one also calls $F$ a **refinement**);
* a **stratified homeomorphism** (or **stratified iso**) if $F : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism of spaces and $\mathsf{Exit}(F)$ is an isomorphism of posets.

\end{terminology}

## Fundamental categories

Just as spaces have [[fundamental infinity-groupoid|fundamental]] $\infty$-[[fundamental infinity-groupoid|groupoids]], stratified spaces also have "[[fundamental category|fundamental categories]]". However, the role of *sets* for spaces is now played by *posets*: the following table illustrates the analogy. (The table is further explained below.)

| base concept | $\infty$-concept | presentation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [[set|sets]] $\simeq$ $(0,0)$-[[0-category|categories]] | ∞-sets $\simeq$ [[topological space|spaces]] | sets with w.e. |
| [[poset|posets]] $\simeq$ $(0,1)$-[[(0,1)-category|categories]] | ∞-posets $\simeq$ **stratified spaces** | posets with w.e. |
| [[category|categories]] $=$ $(1,1)$-categories | [[(∞,1)-category|∞-categories]] | [[categories with weak equivalences|categories with w.e.]] |

In the table, an "$\infty$-X" is intuitively to be understood as an [[(∞,∞)-category]] which admits a [[conservative functor]] to an X, where X can e.g. stand for "set", "poset", or "category". Yet more generally, X can be an [[(n,r)-category]] for $n,r \lt \infty$. A "set with weak equivalences" means a poset with weak equivalences in which each arrow is a weak equivalence. The left column is related to the middle column by an "$\infty$-zation functor" (which simply includes $1$-structures into $\infty$-structures), and the middle and right columns are related by an "[[category with weak equivalences#InfCatPres|∞-localization functor]]" (which should be a weak equivalence in some sense).

In order to make the above precise, one must work with sufficiently convenient stratifications. We describe two simple ways of constructing/presenting **fundamental $\infty$-posets** below.

### For conical stratificiations {#conical_strat}

\begin{defn} Given stratifications $(X,f)$ and $(Y,g)$ their **product** is the stratification of $X \times Y$ with characteristic map $f \times g$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} Given a stratification $(X,f)$, the **stratified (open) cone** $(\mathrm{cone}(X), \mathrm{cone}(f))$ stratifies the topological open cone $\mathrm{cone}(X) = X \times [0,1) / X \times \{0\}$ by the product $(X,f) \times (0,1)$ away from the cone point $\{0\}$ (here, the open interval $(0,1)$ is trivially stratified), and by setting the cone point $\{0\}$ to be its own stratum.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} A **conical** stratification $(X,f)$ is a stratification in which each point $x \in X$ has a neighborhood (i.e. an open substratification) that is a stratified product $U \times (\mathrm{cone}(Z),\mathrm{cone}(l))$ with $x \in U \times \{0\}$.
\end{defn}

Every conical stratification is frontier-constructible.

\begin{defn} Given a conical stratification $(X,f)$, then [Lurie]{#LurieHA} constructs **entrance path $\infty$-category** $\mathcal{E}\mathrm{ntr}(f)$ as a quasicategory: the $k$-simplices of the quasicategory $\mathcal{E}\mathrm{ntr}(f)$ are precisely stratified maps $\parallel [k]\parallel \to (X,f)$, where $[k] = (0 \to 1 \to ... \to k)$.
\end{defn}

The construction translates objects in the middle row from the first column to the second column. See also [[poset-stratified spaces]] under "exit path $\infty$-category" for more.

### For regular stratifications {#regular_strat}

\begin{defn} A stratification $(X,f)$ is **regular** if it admits a refinement $\parallel P \parallel \to (X,f)$ by the stratified realization of some poset $P$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn} Given a regular stratification $(X,f)$ and a refinement $\parallel P\parallel \to (X,f)$, one can construct the **presented entrance path $\infty$-category** $\mathcal{PE}\mathrm{ntr}(f)$ as a poset with weak equivalences with underlying poset $P$ and weak equivalences $\mathsf{Exit}(F)^{-1}(\mathrm{id})$.
\end{defn}

(Showing that this construction is, in an appropriate sense, independent of the choice of $P$ requires a bit more work...)

\begin{rmk} \label{rmk_cellulable} A special case of the definition asks for refinements by regular cell complexes (or simplicial complexes) in place of classifying stratifications of posets, in which case one speaks of **cellulable** (resp. **triangulable**) stratifications.
\end{rmk}

The construction translates objects in the middle row from the first column to the third column in the above table.
