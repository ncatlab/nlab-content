## Idea

_Cubical type theory_ is a version of [[homotopy type theory]] in which [[univalence]] is not just an [[axiom]] but a [[theorem]], hence, since this is [[constructive mathematics|constructive]], has "computational content". Cubical type theory models the [[infinity-groupoid]]-structure implied by [[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf]] [[identity types]] on [[constructive set theory|constructive]] [[cubical sets]], whence the name.

The first constructive account of the univalence axiom was given in ([Coquand 13](#Coquand13), [Bezem-Coquand-Huber 17](#BezemCoquandHuber17)), called the "BCH-model".

The BCH model, unfortunately, has some problems that appear to make it unsuitable for general [[HoTT]].  In particular, it is not known how to model [[higher inductive types]]. The problem is that the BCH model is based on [[presheaves]] on the '[[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[cube category]]', which is basically the [[free construction|free]] [[PROP]] generated by an [[interval]].
In particular, the base category's maps are generated by face maps and permutative renamings of dimension variables (this is where the 'symmetric monoidal' part comes in). For somewhat technical reasons, this doesn't work out when you want to define the [[elimination rules]] for [[higher inductive types]] (like for the [[circle]]).

To account for [[HIT]]s, you seem to need [[diagonals]] in the base category.  There is more than one choice in addition as to what other morphisms to add.

* If you add only diagonals, then you have the '[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] cube category'.  This was used as a basis for a cubical type theory by [Angiuli, Brunerie, Coquand, Favonia, Harper, and Licata](#ABCFHL).

* The first cubical type theory, due to [Cohen-Coquand-Huber-Moertberg 17](#CohenCoquandHuberMoertberg17), used an even richer [[cube category]], the free [[De Morgan algebra]] generated by an [[interval]]. In addition to diagonals, this includes what are called 'reversals' and 'connections'.

Both models validate [[univalence]] (like the BCH model) and can be used to model a variety of [[HIT]]s as well as supporting a syntactic type theory based on 'dimension variables'.  However, while it is possible to interpret the Martin-L&#246;f [[identity type]] in all of these models, it is only equivalent to, not definitionally isomorphic to, the native cubical path-types in the model.  Thus, the latter support the Martin-Lof eliminator, but only with a typal computation rule.

## Models

Cubical type theory can be modeled in a number of varieties of [[cubical sets]], for example in a [[type-theoretic model structure]].
