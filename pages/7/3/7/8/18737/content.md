## Idea

_Cubical type theory_ is a flavor of [[dependent type theory]] in which maps out of an interval primitive is used to define [[cubical path types]], rather than the [[inductive family]] of Martin-Löf [[identity types]] as in [[Martin-Löf type theory]]. Cubical type theory additionally differs from [[Martin-Löf type theory]] in that [[function extensionality]] is a [[theorem]] in cubical type theory, rather than an axiom as is the case in [[Martin-Löf type theory]]. 

Similarly to [[Martin-Löf type theory]], cubical type theory comes in [[extensional type theory|extensional]] and [[intensional type theory|intensional]] flavours as well. One could also add an [[equality reflection]] rule for path types to make the cubical type theory definitionally extensional. 

{#UnivalentCubicalTypeTheory} [[univalence|Univalent]] cubical type theory models the [[infinity-groupoid|$\infty$-groupoid]]-structure implied by [[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf]] [[identity types]] on [[constructive set theory|constructive]] [[cubical sets]] (whence the name) thus making it a form of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Syntax

### The interval and face formulas

We begin with a [[dependent type theory]] which has rules for [[dependent product types]], [[dependent sum types]], the [[empty type]], [[unit type]], [[booleans type]], and [[natural numbers type]]. 

Cubical type theory adds to dependent type theory an interval primitive $I$, whose elements are called "dimensions" as well as face formulas $F$, which behave like propositions in a [[propositional logic]]. Both come with the following judgments for dimension variables and face formulae:

$$\frac{\Gamma \; ctx}{\Gamma, i:I \; ctx} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \; ctx \quad \Gamma \vdash \phi:F}{\Gamma, \phi \; ctx}$$

Similarly to types, dimension variables and face formulas come with their own [[substitution rules]], [[weakening rules]], and [[hypothesis rules]]. 

In addition, there are rules for forming the endpoints of the interval:

$$\frac{\Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash 0:I} \qquad \frac{\Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash 1:I}$$

Equality of dimensions in the interval is a face formula:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash r:I \quad \Gamma \vdash s:I}{\Gamma \vdash r = s:I}$$

and face formulas are closed under disjunction

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash \phi:F \quad \Gamma \vdash \psi:F}{\Gamma \vdash \phi \vee \psi:F}$$

Since face formulae behave like propositions, it should be possible to judge them to be true. Thus, we have the following rules:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash \phi \; true}{\Gamma \vdash \phi \vee \psi \; true} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash \psi \; true}{\Gamma \vdash \phi \vee \psi \; true} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash \phi \vee \psi \; true \quad \Gamma, \phi \vdash \chi \; true \quad \Gamma, \psi \vdash \chi \; true}{\Gamma \vdash \chi \; true}$$

The interval primitive $I$ has more points than $0$ and $1$, so it is not the case that the sequent
$$r:I \vdash r = 0 \vee r = 1 \;\mathrm{true}$$
holds.  Thus, there is a **boundary formula**
$$\delta(r) \coloneqq r = 0 \vee r = 1$$


## Canonicity in cubical type theory

In contrast to [[Martin-Löf type theory]], there exist cubical type theories, such as [[XTT]], in which [[UIP]] is not just an [[axiom]] but a [[theorem]]. Similarily, there exist cubical type theories in which [[univalence]] is not just an [[axiom]] but a [[theorem]]. As a result, in those cubical type theories, [[canonicity]] still holds. This is useful for computational purposes, and for the use of [[cubical type theory]] in [[proof assistants]]. 

However, it is equally valid to add an [[axiom]] to a cubical type theory that says all [[type universe]] satisfy [[UIP]] or [[univalence]], so canonicity is not required to hold in all cubical type theories. 

## Univalent cubical type theories

The first constructive account of the univalence axiom was given in ([Coquand 13](#Coquand13), [Bezem-Coquand-Huber 17](#BezemCoquandHuber17)), called the "BCH-model".

The BCH model, unfortunately, has some problems that appear to make it unsuitable for general [[HoTT]].  In particular, it is not known how to model [[higher inductive types]]. The problem is that the BCH model is based on [[presheaves]] on the '[[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[cube category]]', which is basically the [[free construction|free]] [[PROP]] generated by an [[interval]].
In particular, the base category's maps are generated by face maps and permutative renamings of dimension variables (this is where the 'symmetric monoidal' part comes in). For somewhat technical reasons, this doesn't work out when you want to define the [[elimination rules]] for [[higher inductive types]] (like for the [[circle]]).

To account for [[HIT|HITs]], you seem to need [[diagonals]] in the base category.  There is more than one choice in addition as to what other morphisms to add.

* If you add only diagonals, then you have the '[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] cube category'.  This was used as a basis for a cubical type theory by [Angiuli, Brunerie, Coquand, Favonia, Harper, and Licata](#ABCFHL).

* The first cubical type theory, due to [Cohen-Coquand-Huber-Moertberg 17](#CohenCoquandHuberMoertberg17), used an even richer [[cube category]], the free [[De Morgan algebra]] generated by an [[interval]]. In addition to diagonals, this includes what are called 'reversals' and 'connections'.

Both models validate [[univalence]] (like the BCH model) and can be used to model a variety of [[HIT|HITs]] as well as supporting a syntactic type theory based on 'dimension variables'.  However, while it is possible to interpret the Martin-L&#246;f [[identity type]] in all of these models, it is only equivalent to, not definitionally isomorphic to, the native cubical path-types in the model.  Thus, the latter support the Martin-Lof eliminator, but only with a typal computation rule.

## Models

Cubical type theory can be modeled in a number of varieties of [[cubical sets]], for example in a [[type-theoretic model structure]].
