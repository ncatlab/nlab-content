## Idea

In the [[philosophy of science]], and particularly the [[philosophy of physics]]. _empiricism_ is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] sentiment that knowledge about the [[observable universe]] does and, ultimately, can only derive from empirical observation ([[measurement]], [[experiment]]), as opposed to from intellectual reflection, such as in [[universal exceptionalism]] and/or ([[absolute idealism|absolute]]) [[idealism]].

A contemporary variant of empriricism appears in discussion of the "[[multiverse]]" to the extent that this rejects the existence of a fundamental [[theory (physics)|theory]] from which reality may be derived, and proclaims the necessity to simply observe fundamental fields and "constants of nature" as what they appear, giving up on theoretical explanation.
