## Idea

In the [[philosophy of science]], and particularly the [[philosophy of physics]]. _empiricism_ is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] sentiment that knowledge about the [[observable universe]] does and, ultimately, can only derive from empirical observation ([[measurement]], [[experiment]]), as opposed to from intellectual reflection, such as in [[exceptional naturalism]] and/or ([[absolute idealism|absolute]]) [[idealism]].

A variant of empiricism due to [van Fraasen 80](#vanFraasen80) came to be known as _constructive empiricism_ which (according to [SEP-CE](#SEP-CE), [here](plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructive-empiricism/#UndeConsEmpi))

> holds that science aims at truth about observable aspects of the world, but that science does not aim at truth about unobservable aspects.

A contemporary variant of empriricism appears in discussion of the "[[multiverse]]" to the extent that this rejects the existence of a fundamental [[theory (physics)|theory]] from which reality may be derived, and proclaims the necessity to simply observe fundamental fields and "constants of nature" as what they appear, giving up on theoretical explanation.
