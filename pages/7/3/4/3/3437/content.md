There are various ways to deal with size issues in the [[foundations]] of [[category theory]], [[higher category theory]], and [[mathematics]] in general.

I would like to write an article here about the various ways of doing so, but in the meantime here are some links:

*  [[set]], [[proper class]], [[Grothendieck universe]]
*  [[small category]], [[essentially small category]], [[large category]]
*  [[Set]], [[Cat]], [[michaelshulman:category of all sets]]
*  [[small presheaf]], [[accessible category]], [[presentable category]]
