## Definition

A [[simplicial set]] $X$ is (sometimes) called _reduced_ if it has a single vertex, $X_0 \simeq *$.

## Properties

### Reflection

Write $sSet_0 \hookrightarrow$ [[sSet]] for the [[full subcategory]] inclusion of the reduced simplicial sets into all of them.

This is a [[reflective subcategory]]. The reflector

$$
  red : sSet \to sSet_0
$$

identifies all vertices of a simplicial set.

### Model structure

There is a [[model structure on reduced simplicial sets]] (see there) which serves as a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[connected]] [[∞-groupoids]].
