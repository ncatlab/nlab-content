## Idea

The notion of _differential graded manifold_ is a generalization of the notion of [[smooth manifold]] from ordinary [[geometry]] to [[higher geometry]], specifically to [[dg-geometry]].  Typically it is taken to be the [[Isbell duality|formal dual]] to a [[dgc-algebra]] which in degree-0 is the [[algebra of function|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]] on an ordinary [[smooth manifold]]. 

Hence this is a _[[graded manifold]]_ whose [[algebra of functions]] is equipped with a compatible [[differential]].

Sometimes this is called an "[[NQ-supermanifold]]". 

## Examples

* An [[L-∞ algebroid]] over a smooth manifold may be thought of as a dg-manifold concentrated in non-negative degree.

* A [[derived L-∞ algebroid]] may be thought of as a dg-manifold in arbitrary degree.
