# Idea #

A _gauge theory_ is a [[quantum field theory]] whose field configurations are cocycles in [[differential cohomology]].

## ordinary gauge theories

An _ordinary gauge theory_ is a [[quantum field theory]] whose field configurations are [[vector bundle]]s 
[[connection on a bundle|with connection]].

This includes notable the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the [[standard model of particle physics]]:

* Ordinary [[electromagnetism]] in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]. 

* Fields in [[Yang-Mills theory]] (such as appearing in the [[standard model of particle physics]] and in [[GUT]]s) are [[vector bundle]]s [[connection on a bundle|with connection]].

Other examples include formal physical models.

* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is a gauge theory whose field configurations are $G$-[[principal bundle]]s for $G$ a finite group (these come with a unique [[connection on a bundle|connection]], so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

## higher and generalized gauge theories ##

The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree 1 [[differential cohomology]].

More generally, a _higher gauge theory_ is a [[quantum field 
theory]] whose field configurations are cocycles in more general [[differential cohomology]], for instance higher degree [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycles]] or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential [[K-theory]].

This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

* The [[magnetic current]] in [[electromagnetism]] is a [[bundle gerbe|bundle gerbe with connection]], a [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] refining a cocycle in degree 3 [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology]]: the _magnetic charge_ .

But a whoe tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher [[supergravity]] theories,

* The [[Kalb-Ramond field]] is a [[bundle gerbe|bundle gerbe with connection]], a [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] with curvature 3-form.

* The [[supergravity C-field]] is a [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] with curvature 4-form.

* The [[RR-field]] is a cocycle in [[differential K-theory]].


## gravity as a gauge theory ##

There are various models that realize gravity also as a gauge theory.

# Anomalies #

Even in the absence of chiral fermions, the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] is a famous phenomenon in [[differential cohomology]] by which such a [[quantum anomaly]] cancels against that given by chiral fermions.

# list of gauge fields and their models #

The following tries to give an overview of some collection of gauge fields in physics, their models by [[differential cohomology]] and further details.

* [[Yang-Mills field]]

  * cocycle in lowest degree [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|nonabelian differential cohomology]]

  * [[field strength]] depending on the [[group]] $G$ we have
  
    * $G = U(1)$ - [[electromagnetism]] (see below)

    * $G = SU(2)\times U(1)$ - electroweak force field strength

    * $G = SU(3)$ - strong nuclear force field
