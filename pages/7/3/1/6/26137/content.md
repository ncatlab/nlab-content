In the [[type theory]] literature, there are different kinds of [[types]] which are called *heterogeneous equality* types:

* *[[heterogeneous identity types]]* are a variant of [[identity types]] but parameterized over pairs of possibly different types,

* *[[John Major equality]]* types are the [[dependent sum]] of heterogeneous identity types over all relevant [[identifications]].
