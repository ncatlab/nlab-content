## Idea

A _quantum programming language_ is a [[programming language]] for [[quantum computation]].

In as far as [[data types]] in [[classical physics|classical]] [[programming languages]] may and often are understood in terms of ([[dependent type theory|dependent]]) [[type theory]], quantum programming languages concern quantum data types such as "[[qbits]]" which may be understood via [[linear logic]] ([Pratt (1992)](#Pratt92)) in ([[dependent linear type theory|dependent]]) [[linear type theory]] (e.g. [Abramsky & Duncan (2005)](#AbramskyDuncan05); [Duncan (2006)](#Duncan06); [Dal Lago & Faggian (2012)](linear+logic#DalLagoFaggianQuote); [Green et al (2013)](#GLRSV13); [Staton (2015)](#Staton15)):

Many existing quantum programming languages are in fact [[domain specific programming languages]] for the description of [[quantum circuits]] compiled from [[quantum logic gates]], and as such often [[domain specific embedded programming language|embedded]] into ambient [[type theories]] (eg. *[[Quipper]]* and *[[QWIRE]]*).

Other QPLs are more algorithmic (such as *[[Q Sharp]]*).
