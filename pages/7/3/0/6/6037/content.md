## Definition

An _$n$-vector bundle_ is an [[associated ∞-bundle]] whose [[fiber]]s are [[n-vector space]]s of sorts.


## Examples

* For $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ the [[circle n-group|circle 2-group]] and $2 Vect$ the category of [[2-vector space]]s (objects are [[categories]] equivalence to $A$ [[Mod]] for some [[associative algebra]] or algebroid $A$, morphisms are [[bimodule]]s) there is a canonical 1-dimensional [[∞-representation]]

  $$
    \rho : \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B} U(1) \to 2 Vect
  $$

  on the 1-dimensional 2-vector space $Vect_{\mathcal{C}}$.

  For $g : X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ a [[cocycle]] for a [[circle n-bundle|circle 2-bundle]], the composite

  $$
    \rho(g) : X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) \stackrel{\rho}{\to} 2 Vect
  $$

  is the corresponding classifying map for the "associated line 2-bundle".

  A [[section]] of $\rho(g)$ is a [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundle]] with twist given by $\rho$.
