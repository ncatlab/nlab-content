Let $A$ be a [[nonassociative algebra]] over the field $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers equipped with an involution $x\mapsto \bar{x}$ which is an involutive antiautomorphism. Then one defines a new algebra, the __double__ $A^2$ of $A$ which is the biproduct $A\oplus A$ as an abelian group for addition (and the cartesian square as a $\mathbb{R}$-vector space), and with the multiplication rule given by
$$
(a, b)\cdot(u,v) = (au-\bar{v}b,b\bar{u}+va).
$$
Map $a\mapsto (a,0)$ is the monomorphism $A\to A^2$. If $A$ is unital with unit $1$ then $A^2$ is unital with unit $(1,0)$. In the unital case, the element $e:=(0,1)$ has the property $e^2 = -1=(-1,0)$. Then the formula
$$
\widebar{a+be} := \bar{a}-be
$$
defines the involution in $A^2$ and the doubling procedure can be iterated.

Regarding that $ea=\bar{a}e$, if the involution in $A$ is nontrivial then the double $A^2$ is noncommutative. If $A$ is not commutative then the double is not even associative. If $A$ is associative then $A^2$ is still an [[alternative algebra]].

The standard example is the sequence of consecutive doubles starting with $\mathbb{R}$ (with trivial involution): $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{H}^2=\mathbb{C}\mathrm{a}$, $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{a}^2$ etc.
