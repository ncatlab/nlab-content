#Definition: Stacky Lie groupoid#

A _stacky Lie groupoid_ (in contrast to a [[Lie groupoid]]) is a [[groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] the category of [[differentiable stack|differentiable stacks]], such that the space of objects is an ordinary manifold.

Stacky Lie groupoids and their [[Lie theory]] were introduced and studied by [Chenchang Zhu](http://chenchangzhu.blogspot.com/) and collaborators.
