## Idea

__Predicate logic__, also called __first-order logic__ and sometimes abbreviated __FOL__, is the usual sort of [[logic]] used in the [[foundations of mathematics]].  

In contrast to [[0th-order logic]], first-order logic admits [[variables]] in [[predicates]] [[bound variable|bound]] by _[[quantification|quantifiers]]_ ("[[universal quantifier|for all]]" $\forall$ and "[[existential quantifier|there exists]] $\exists$). 

(This means that the [[categorical semantics]] of 1st order logic is given by _[[hyperdoctrines]]_.)

However, in contrast to [[higher-order logic]], first-order logic does not allow variables that stand for predicates themselves.  (This distinction can become somewhat confusing when the first-order theory in question is a [[material set theory]], such as [[ZFC]], in which the variables stand for "sets" which behave very much like predicates.)

A __predicate calculus__ is simply a system for describing and working with predicate logic.  The precise form of such a calculus (and hence of the logic itself) depends on whether one is using [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]], [[linear logic]], etc; see those articles for details.

[[type theory|Typed]] predicate logic may be called [[type theory#Logic over type theory|first-order logic over type theory]]. Typed predicate [[intuitionistic logic]] is often identified with the [[internal logic]] of a [[Heyting category]], while typed predicate [[classical logic]] is often identified with the [[internal logic]] of a [[Boolean category]]. Any untyped predicate logic could be thought of as a [[simple type theory|simply typed]] predicate logic with only one type $V$, known as the __[[domain of discourse]]__ or the __universe of discourse__. 

For many (perhaps most?) authors, predicate logic is really __predicate logic with [[equality]]__. That means that one predicate symbol with two arguments $=(x,y)$ (also  written $x=y$) is distinguished, and has to satisfy reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and the rule of substitution: $(x = y \wedge \phi(x))\implies \phi(y)$ for any predicate $\phi$ with one argument. However, some forms of predicate logic do not include an equality primitive, such as [[FOLDS]] (in whose name 'FOL' stands for 'first-order logic').  In some first-order theories, such as [[ZFC]], equality can be defined and so is not needed in the logic itself.

In constructive mathematics, one could also have a __predicate logic with [[apartness]]__, which has one predicate symbol with two arguments $\#(x,y)$ (also  written $x\#y$) is distinguished, and has to satisfy irreflexivity, symmetry, and comparison. By definition of an [[apartness relation]], its negation is an [[equivalence relation]], which we could take to be [[equality]] $x = y \coloneqq \neg(x \# y)$ satisfying the rule of substitution: $(\neg(x \# y) \wedge \phi(x))\implies \phi(y)$ for any predicate $\phi$ with one argument. This makes the domain of discourse into an [[apartness space]].
