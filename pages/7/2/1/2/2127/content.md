An object $X$ of a category is **small** if it is $\kappa$-[[compact object|compact]] for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ (and therefore also for all greater regular cardinals as well). Here, $X$ is called $\kappa$-compact if the corepresentable functor $hom(X,\cdot)$ preserves $\kappa$-[[filtered category|filtered]] colimits.
