## Idea

This is a seemingly new notion (this is not exactly the same thing than a graded Hopf algebra without antipode) usefull in the context of [[graded codifferential category]] and to characterize symmetric powers.

## Definition

A graded bimonoid in a [[CMon-enriched symmetric monoidal category]] is given by a family $(A_{n})_{n \ge 0}$ of objects, a family $(\nabla_{n,p}:A_{n} \otimes A_{p} \rightarrow A_{n+p})_{n,p \ge 0}$ of morphisms and a family $(\Delta_{n,p}:A_{n+p} \rightarrow A_{n} \otimes A_{p})_{n,p \ge 0}$ of morphisms which verify some coherences:

* $((A_{n})_{n \ge 0},(\nabla_{n,p})_{n,p \ge 0}))$ is a [[graded monoid]]
* $((A_{n})_{n \ge 0},(\Delta_{n,p})_{n,p \ge 0}))$ is a [[graded comonoid]]
