Arne Mertens is a guest lecturer at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Antwerp (UA), where he works in the research group of [[Wendy Lowen]].  His research interests include homotopy theory and higher structures, as well as homological algebra and deformation theory. In particular he studies models for linear $\infty$-categories, with a focus on applications in non-commutative algebraic geometry.
