## Idea

If [[particles]] species are identified [[simple objects]] of a [[DHR category]], then the elements of the corresponding [[dual object]] are called **antiparticles**.

Similarly, in the [[topological quantum field theory | (2+1)-TQFT]] setting isomorphism classes of quasiparticles will correspond to simple objects of a [[modular tensor category]]. The anti-quasiparticle of a quasiparticle is its dual, under the [[rigid category | rigidity]] structure of your category.

## Examples

In the [[standard model of particle physics]], every [[fundamental particle | particle]] has an antiparticle. For example, the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is the [[positron]].

In the realm of (2+1)-TQFTs, the most simple example is the [[quantum double anyon model]] applied to an abelian group. For every finite abelian group $G$ such a model can be created, and quasiparticles can be explicitly described. They correspond to pairs $(g,\chi)$ where $g\in G$ is a group element and $\chi\in \widehat{G}$ is a [[character]]. The antiparticle is $(g^{-1},\chi^{-1})$, where both the inverses are taken with respect to the group operation.

Just like inverses play a key role in the theory of finite groups, antiparticles play a key role in the theory of (2+1)-TQFTs and modular tensor categories.
