## Idea

In [[physics]], given a [[physical system]] then its _space of [[trajectories]]_ or _[[space of histories]]_ is the [[space]] of all ways that the system may be configured (without imposing [[equations of motion]]) in space and _[[time]]_, hence in _[[spacetime]]_. 

For a [[field theory]] over a [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ and defined by a [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$, the space of trajectories is the space of [[field (physics)|field]] configurations over spacetimes, which is the [[space of sections]] of the field bundle.

For [[Lagrangian field theories]] this space of trajectories carries a canonical [[presymplectic form]] and it comes with an [[equation of motion]] that picks some of the trajectories as being the "physically realizable ones". The subspace of trajectories solving the equations of motion (the "[[shell]]") equipped with this [[presymplectic form]] is called the _[[covariant phase space]]_ of the system.

For the moment see at _[[field theory]]_ for more details.
