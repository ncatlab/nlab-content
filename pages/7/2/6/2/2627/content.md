## Idea

A $2$-rig is a [[categorification]] of a [[rig]].  There is more than one inequivalent notion; just as a rig is a multiplicative [[monoid]] whose underlying set also has a notion of addition, so a $2$-rig is a [[monoidal category]] whose underlying category also has a notion of addition, and we can describe this notion of addition in a few different ways.

Note that we don\'t expect to have additive inverses; by the same argument as in the [[Eilenberg swindle]], they are unreasonable to expect.  However, in an [[abelian category]], we have as close to additive inverses as is reasonable and so a categorification of a [[ring]].


## Definitions

1.  A __$2$-rig__ might be an [[Ab-enriched category]] which is [[enriched monoidal category|enriched monoidal]].

2.  A __$2$-rig__ might be an [[additive category]] which is enriched monoidal.

3.  A __$2$-rig__ might be a monoidal category with finite [[coproducts]] such that the monoidal product distributes over the coproducts.

4.  A __$2$-rig__ might be a [[closed monoidal category]] with finite coproducts.

5.  Finally, a __$2$-ring__ is a monoidal [[abelian category]].

Note that (2) is a special case of both (1) and (3), which are independent.  (4) is a special case of (3), by a theorem.  (5) is a special case of (2), of course.
