## Idea

The so-called _Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic_ (sometimes _FTA_, although this can also mean the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]]) is the statement that the [[ring of integers]] is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD).  The theorem is much older than the abstract concepts of [[ring theory]], and indeed the concept of UFD is an abstraction of this theorem.  Inasumuch as '[[arithmetic]]' can refer to [[number theory]], this is a pretty basic theorem in that field.
