## Idea 

 The [[Moore complex]] of a [[simplicial group]] (or, more generally, any [[simplicially enriched groupoid]]), carries a lot more structure that just a [[chain complex]] of group(oid)s. This structure is its structure as a **hypercrossed complex**.  The notion was introduced by [[Pilar Carrasco]] in her thesis.
