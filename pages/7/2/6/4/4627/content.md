An analogue of a derived category of differential graded $R$-modules, where $R$ is an associative ring can be found when the ring is replaced by a more general algebra over an operad.

*Abstract.* We present a general construction of the derived category of an algebra over an operad and establish its invariance properties. A central role is played by the [[enveloping operad]] of an algebra over an operad.
