## Idea

In the construction of the [[Lagrangian density]] for the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[worldvolume]] [[gauge field|gauge]] [[quantum field theory]] on [[intersecting brane|coincident]] [[M2-branes]] (the [[BLG model]]/[[ABJM model]], a [[conformal field theory|conformal]] [[supersymmetry|super]]-[[Chern-Simons theory]] coupled to  [[matter]]-[[field (physics)|fields]]) a certain [[algebra|algebraic]] structure appears -- and at least in the [[BLG model]] it appears at a pivotal stage in the [[proof]] of [[supersymmetry]] -- which is given by a  [[multilinear map|trilinear map]] on an [[inner product space]] $V$

$$
  V \otimes V \otimes V \overset{ [-,-,-] }{\longrightarrow} V
$$

that is subject to some [[axioms]] which are different from but clearly reminiscent to the [[axioms]] on the [[Lie bracket]] of a [[Lie algebra]], (which is of course a bilinear map).

In special cases, but not generally, this algebraic structure is a special case of a structure introduced by Filippov, which could be called a [[Filippov algebra]], but which mostly came to alternatively be called a _3-Lie algebra_ or a _Lie 3-algebra_ or often just a _3-algebra_.  

Unfortunately, in [[homotopy theory]] and [[higher algebra]], these terms refer to something different, namely to [[L-infinity algebras]] or [[categorification|categorifications]] of [[associative algebras]] to [[n-algebras]] -- but the structure seen in the [[BLG model]] on [[M2-branes]] is _none_ of these.

Hence to be on the safe side, one may want to speak of _M2-brane 3-algebras_ or maybe _M-brane algebras_, for definiteness

Moreover, while this "M2-brane 3-algebra" appeared to be a central ingredient in the [[BLG model]], it makes _no_ appearance in the [[ABJM model]], which however generalizes and hence subsumes the BLG model, up to slight re-identifications of terms.

Indeed, inspection reveals that "M2-brane 3-algebras" give rise to and may be re-constructed from data in ordinary [[Lie theory]], namely from [[pairs]] consisting of a [[metric Lie algebra]] and a [[dualizable object|dualizable]] [[Lie algebra representation]]. 

$$
  \big\{
    \text{M2-brane 3-algebras}
  \big\}
  \;\;\overset{\simeq}{\leftrightarrow}
  \big\{
    \text{dualizable modules over metric Lie algebras}
  \big\}
$$
