## Idea

The Swiss cheese operad is an analogue of the [[little disks operad]],
where disks are replaced by half-disks,
which contain both ordinary disks in their interior,
as well as half-disks positioned at the flat boundary.

This structure can be organized into an [[operad]]
in the category of [[modules]] over the [[little disks operad]].

The Swiss cheese operad over rationals is not formal,
unlike the little disks operad.
