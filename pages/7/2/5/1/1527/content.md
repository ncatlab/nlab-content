Coinduction is a method of proof which relies on the fact that any two states of the [[terminal coalgebra]] for an endofunctor $H$ must be equal if they are indistinguishable under repeated operations of $H$. That is, there are no proper coalgebra [[quotient object]]s.

Coinduction is [[duality|dual]] to [[induction]].  It generalises to [[corecursion]].
