## Definition

In [[classical mathematics]], let $(X, \mathcal{O}(X))$ be a [[topological space]]. A **punctured neighborhood** of an element $x \in X$ is the subset of a [[neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ consisting of all elements in $U$ which are not equal to $x$, or equivalently, the relative [[complement]] $U / \{x\}$. 

In [[constructive mathematics]], let $(X, \mathcal{O}(X))$ be a [[topological space]] with a [[tight apartness relation]] $\#$. An element $x \in X$ is strictly apart from a subset $U \subseteq X$ if for all elements $y \in X$, $y \in U$ implies that $x \# y$. A **punctured neighborhood** of an element $x \in X$ is the subset of a [[neighborhood]] $U$ of $x$ consisting of all elements in $U$ which are strictly apart from $x$. 

The tight apartness relation is needed in constructive mathematics because in the [[real numbers]], a neighborhood around a real number $c$ is an [[open interval]] $(c - \epsilon, c + \epsilon)$ where $\epsilon$ is a positive real number, and a punctured neighborhood is the set of real numbers $x$ in the open interval $(c - \epsilon, c + \epsilon)$ where $0 \lt {|x - c|}$. The tight apartness relation $x \# c$ holds precisely if and only if $0 \lt {|x - c|}$.
