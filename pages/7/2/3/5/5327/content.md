Term __additive K-theory__ is a synonym for [[cyclic homology]], used in early articles mainly of Russian and a bit by French school. 

__Additive K-theory__ is also a title of a historical article

* [[Boris Tsygan]], [[Boris Feigin]],  _Additive K-theory_, in LNM 1289 (1987), edited by Yu. I. Manin, pp. 67--209, seminar 1984-1986 in Moscow), [MR89a:18017](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=923136)

The additive K-theory is here studied in relation to algebraic K-theory and Hochschild homology. Like there is a K-theory spectrum, one also constructs a additive K-theory/cyclic homology spectrum.
