## Idea

A *skew brace* is a [[set]] equipped with a [[pair]] of [[group]] [[structures]] satisfying some compatibility conditions. 

This is a generalization of the concept of *[[brace]]* (an algebraic structure due W. Rump), which it reduces to when one of the groups is [[abelian group|Abelian]]. 

Skew baces can be used to construct solutions to the [[set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation]]; their actions can be used to construct solutions of the [[reflection equation]].
