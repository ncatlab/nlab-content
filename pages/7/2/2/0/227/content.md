A _ring_ is a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Ab]].  Here $Ab$ is the category of [[abelian group|abelian groups]], made into a monoidal category using the tensor product of abelian groups.

Equivalently, a ring is a one-object category [[enriched category|enriched]] over $Ab$.

Don't worry: these definitions equivalent to [the one you're used to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_mathematics#Definition).
