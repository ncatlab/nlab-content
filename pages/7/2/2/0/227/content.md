A **unital ring** is (equivalently)

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Ab]].  
* a [[monoid]] [[enriched category|enriched over]] [[Ab]].
* a [[ringoid]] with one object.

Here $Ab$ is the category of [[abelian group|abelian groups]], made into a monoidal category using the tensor product of abelian groups.

Don't worry: these definitions equivalent to [the one you're used to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_mathematics#Definition).

In usual ring theory people often talk about nonunital rings as well: multiplicative [[semigroup]]s with [[abelian group]] structure where the multiplication is distributive toward addition. Once written diagrammatically, these notions can be defined in any [[symmetric monoidal category]].
If the semigroup is abelian than the ring is said to be **commutative**. 

A commutative unital ring is an [[abelian monoid]] in [[Ab]].
