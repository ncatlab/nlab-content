## Idea

In the construction of the [[NSR string]] as a [[2d SCFT]] from a supersymmetric [[sigma-model]] one needs to remove one half of the [[sigma-model]]-excitations in order to achieve that the resulting [[2d SCFT]] satisfies [[modular invariance]], hence that it is defined not just on the [[complex plane]] but also on [[tori]]. This halfing of the naive sigma-model spectrum is called the _GSO projection_, after [GSO 77](#GSO77).

A good account is in [Majer, sections 1.3 and 2](#Majer).

## Properties

### Local spacetime supersymmetry - supergravity

The GSO projection to the [[type II superstring]] together with the [[Goddard-Thorn no-ghost theorem]] implies that the [[effective field theory]] encoded in the [[string scattering amplitudes]] ([[S-matrix]]) is a [[supergravity]] theory ([Green-Schwarz 81](#GreenSchwarz81)).

This way the mere assumption of strings with [[fermions]] in their spectrum (originally just called "[[spinning strings]]") _implies local_ [[supersymmetry]]_ in [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]]. For more on this see [[string theory FAQ]]: _[Does string theory predict supersymmetry?](string+theory+FAQ#DoesSTPredictSupersymmetry)_

### Beyond modular invariance

One should really check that the [[2d SCFT]] is well defined on _all_ [[worldsheet]] [[genus of a surface|genera]], not just on genus 1 as given by [[modular invariance]].

Because [[correlators]] at all the higher genera enter the [[string perturbation series]] at higher [[loop order]]. 

But this is subtle for the [[NSR superstring]], see at _[[super Riemann surface]]_ for more on this. 

A full construction of [[2d CFTs]] at all [[genus of a surface|genera]] has been achieved only for bosonic [[rational 2d CFTs]], see at _[[FRS-theorem on rational 2d CFT]]_.

### The Green-Schwarz string

The [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] [[sigma-model]] gives an alternative description of the [[superstring]], where [[spacetime]] [[supersymmetry]] is manifest throughout the construction. No "GSO projection" is needed here, and no analog of the [[Goddard-Thorn no-ghost theorem]] needs to be proven. The downside is that generalization to higher [[genus of a surface|genera]] and to [[curved spacetimes]] is less immediate or unclear.
