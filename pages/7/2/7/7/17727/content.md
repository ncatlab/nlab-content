## Idea

**Synthetic domain theory**, as its name suggests, is a [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] axiomatization of [[domain theory]], typically in [[toposes]]. The slogan for synthetic domain theory is that "domains are sets", or more precisely, "domains are certain intuitionistic sets" in that one works in an [[intuitionistic]] set theory with certain anti-classical axioms and defines a notion of domain internally. These synthetic domains act like the analytic notions in that domains support arbitrary [[fixed points]] and solutions to non-well-founded recursive domain equations.
