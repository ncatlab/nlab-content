## Idea

**Synthetic domain theory**, as its name suggests, is a [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] axiomatization of [[domain theory]], typically in [[toposes]]. The slogan for synthetic domain theory is that "domains are sets", or more precisely, "domains are certain intuitionistic sets" in that one works in an [[intuitionistic mathematics|intuitionistic]] [[set theory]] with certain anti-classical [[axioms]] and defines a notion of domain internally. These synthetic domains act like the analytic notions in that domains support arbitrary [[fixed points]] and solutions to non-well-founded recursive domain equations.

## Axiomatics

Specific axioms of SDT vary, but a category for synthetic domain theory is typically a [[topos]] equipped with a [[dominance]] $\Sigma$. From this dominance, a $\Sigma$-[[partial map classifier]] can be constructed called the "lift" [[monad]] $L A$. The lift monad has [[initial algebra of an endofunctor|initial and final algebras]] (as a functor, rather than a monad) called $\omega$ and $\overline\omega$ respectively, with an induced [[monomorphism]] $\omega \to \overline \omega$. Then it is required that the induced function $\Sigma^{\overline \omega} \to \Sigma^\omega$ has an [[inverse]]. 

An intuition is that maps out of $\omega$ are a synthetic notion of $\omega$-chains (as in [[CPO|$\omega$-CPOs]]) and maps out of $\overline \omega$ are $\omega$-chains with a limit point. Requiring the inverse above then amounts to requiring that every chain in $\Sigma$ has a *unique* limit point.

## Models

There are two main classes of models of synthetic domain theory: [[realizability toposes]] and [[Grothendieck toposes]].

A Grothendieck topos model that is very closely related to the analytic notion of $\omega$-CPO is given by taking sheaves with respect to the [[canonical topology]] on the full subcategory of $\omega$-CPO whose objects are finite products of $\overline \omega$, i.e., the ordinal $\omega + 1$. This model embeds $\omega$-CPO and the embedding preserves (among other things) limits, coproducts and the [[natural numbers object]]. The $\omega$-CPOs can be characterized as certain $\neg\neg$-separated sheaves.
