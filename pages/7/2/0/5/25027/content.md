## Idea

The **James Webb Space Telescope** is a telescope which observes in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

So far, it has observed distant [[galaxies]] at high redshift, as well as cepheids in SN type IA supernovae, both of which are important in testing the [[standard model of cosmology]], the former for the validity of galaxy formation using [[dark matter]], and the latter for resolving the [[Hubble tension]].
