This is about Birkhoff's variety or HSP theorem in [[universal algebra]], related to [[equational logic]].
While it is sometimes referred to simply as Birkhoff's theorem beware of other well know [[Birkhoff's theorem]]s.

## Statement

+-- {: .num_example #BirkhoffHSP}
###### Theorem 
**(Birkhoff's HSP theorem)**

Given a [[language]] $L$ generated by a set of (single-sorted) finitary operations, and a [[class]] $C$ of [[structures]] for $L$. Then $C$ is the class of models for a set of universally quantified equations between terms of $L$ (a [[Lawvere theory]]) if and only if 

1. (H) The class is closed under homomorphic [[images]] (see [below](#HomomorphicImages)), 

1. (S) The class is closed under subalgebras, 

1. (P) The class is closed under taking products. 

=--

In a more classical wording/terminology it is phrased as

(Birkhoff's variety theorem) A class of algebras of the same signature is a variety of algebras iff it is closed under homomorphic images, subalgebras and arbitrary (small) products.

+-- {: .num_remark #HomomorphicImages}
###### Remark

Here "closed under homomorphic images" means that if $A$ is a structure in the class and $B$ is a structure for $L$, and $\phi \colon A \to B$ is a [[homomorphism]] between them, then also its [[image]] $im(\phi) \hookrightarrow B$ is an element of the class.

###### Remark

The [[first order logic|first-order]] analogue of HSP (theorem \ref{BirkhoffHSP}) is the characterization (see e.g. Chang and Keisler's original text ([Chang-Keisler 66](#ChangKeisler66)) on continuous model theory) of [[elementary classes of structures]] of structures: they're precisely those closed under [[elementary substructures]], [[elementary embeddings]], [[ultraproducts]], and [[ultraroots]] (if an ultrapower of something is in your class, that something was in your class.)
