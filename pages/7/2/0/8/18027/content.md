## Statement

+-- {: .num_example #BirkhoffHSP}
###### Theorem 
**(Birkhoff's HSP theorem)**

Given a [[language]] $L$ generated by a set of (single-sorted) finitary operations, and a [[class]] $C$ of [[structures]] for $L$. Then $C$ is the class of models for a set of universally quantified equations between terms of $L$ (a [[Lawvere theory]]) if and only if 

1. (H) The class is closed under homomorphic [[images]], 

1. (S) The class is closed under subalgebras, 

1. (P) The class is closed under taking products.

###### Remark

The [[first order logic|first-order]] analogue of HSP (theorem \ref{BirkhoffHSP}) is the characterization (see e.g. Chang and Keisler's original text ([Chang-Keisler](#ChangKeisler)) on continuous model theory) of [[elementary classes of structures]] of structures: they're precisely those closed under [[elementary substructures]], [[elementary embeddings]], [[ultraproducts]], and [[ultraroots]] (if an ultrapower of something is in your class, that something was in your class.)
