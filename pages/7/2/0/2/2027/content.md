## Definition


Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], let $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[monoid of regular elements]] in $R$, let $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[complement]] of $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$, the set of [[zero divisors]] in $R$, and let $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ be the [[two-sided ideal]] generated by $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$. A commutative ring is *non-trivial* if $0 \neq 1$. 

\begin{definition}
An **integral domain** is a non-trivial [[commutative ring]] $R$ such that every [[element]] in $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ is equal to zero, or that the [[quotient ring]] $R/I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ is isomorphic to $R$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  Beware that some authors allow an integral domain to be [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative]].
\end{remark}

Since every element of the ideal generated by the set of [[zero divisors]] is equal to zero, and the integral domain is a non-trivial ring, which means that there is at least one zero divisor, it follows that zero is a zero divisor and if $a \cdot b = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. It then follows that every integral domain is a [[reduced ring]]. 

The [[ring of fractions]] of every integral domain is a [[field]], the [[field of fractions]]. 

The ring of [[formal power series]] of an integral domain is a [[local integral domain]]. 

## Examples

* [[GCD domain]]
* [[Bezout domain]]
* [[unique factorization domain]]
* [[principal ideal domain]]
* [[Euclidean domain]]
* [[Dedekind domain]]
* [[field]]
* [[valuation ring]]

## In constructive mathematics

in constructive mathematics, there are different inequivalent ways to define an integral domain. The above definition is sometimes called a **ring without zero divisors** or a **weak integral domain**. Stronger notions include:

\begin{definition}
A **Heyting integral domain** is an integral domain which has a [[tight apartness relation]] and where every element apart from zero is [[regular element in a ring|regular]]. The [[ring of fractions]] of a Heyting integral domain is a [[Heyting field]]. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A **discrete integral domain** is a Heyting integral domain with decidable equality, or a Heyting integral domain where every element is either zero or regular. The [[ring of fractions]] of a discrete integral domain is a [[discrete field]]. 
\end{definition}

Rings without zero divisors and discrete integral domains are both definable in [[coherent logic]]. However, Heyting integral domains can only be defined in [[first-order logic]]. 

## Generalizations

Sometimes, one may want the trivial ring to be an integral domain, resulting in the notion of *[[possibly trivial integral domain]]*. In [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010), the authors define an integral domain to be a possibly trivial integral domain. 

In principle, one could just as easily consider a [[commutative rig]] or [[commutative semiring]] $R$.  In that case, however, only the definition involving the cancellative property extends to rigs and semirings. Furthermore, we should add the additional requirement that addition in $R$ is cancellable (that is, addition by any element is injective), to make the analogue of the previous paragraph correct. Since these could also be done for general [[domains]] to turn them into what could be called [[domain rigs]] and [[domain semirings]], these could be called *commutative domain rigs* or *commutative domain semirings*.
