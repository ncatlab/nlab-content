## Idea

In [[quantum information theory]], *Absorption-Emission codes* or *Æ codes* are a family of [[quantum error correcting codes]] designed to encode [[quantum information]] within a diatomic [[molecule]]'s orientation, allowing changes in [[angular momentum]] and error correction from interference from torques, Raman scattering and spontaneous emission. 

Æ codes are more practical in theory than molecular codes in the sense that they require lower (median) [[momentum]] and can protect against photonic processes. 

They target molecular systems but can also be applied or extended to [[atoms]] and atomic scale ions as long as a Zeeman [[manifold]] with a large enough [[angular momentum]] is present, or any system in which multiple $2J+1$-dimensional [[linear representation|representations]] of [[SU(2)]].

It is formed by defining logical-qubit encoding codewords and theorem proving through Knill-Laflamme conditions, yielding highly tunable symmetric codes which can then be tuned to form a basic error-detecting version.
