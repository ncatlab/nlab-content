## Idea

In [[quantum information theory]], Absorption-emission codes or Ã† codes are a family of [[quantum error correcting code]]s designed to encode [[quantum information]] within a diatomic molecule's orientation, allowing changes in [[angular momentum]] and error correction from interference from torques, Raman scattering and spontaneous emission. They are more practical in theory than molecular codes in the sense that they require lower (median) momentum and can protect against photonic processes. 

They target molecular systems but can also be applied or extended to atoms and atomic scale ions as long as a Zeeman [[manifold]] with a large enough angular momentum is present, or any system in which multiple 2J+1-dimensional representations of a total of SU(2) total angular momentum. 

It is formed by defining logical-qubit encoding codewords and theorem proving through Knill-Laflamme conditions, yielding highly tunable symmetric codes which can then be tuned to form a basic error-detecting version.
