## Idea

In [[type theory]], a **split context** is a [[context]] $\Gamma \vert \Delta$, where the [[judgments]] in $\Gamma$ are required to be separated from the judgments in $\Delta$, so that while it is possible for those in $\Delta$ to depend on those in $\Gamma$, the judgments in $\Gamma$ are not allowed to depend on the judgments in $\Delta$. 

Split contexts are frequently used in [[modal type theories]] such as [[spatial type theory]] and [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] in order to make [[comonadic]] [[modalities]] work. Specifically Shulman's [[real-cohesive homotopy type theory]] and Riley's [[linear homotopy type theory]] use split contexts.
