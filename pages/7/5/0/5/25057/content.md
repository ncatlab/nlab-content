## Idea

In [[type theory]], a **split context** is a context $\Gamma \vert \Delta$, where the judgments in $\Gamma$ are required to be separated from the judgments in $\Delta$, so that while it is possible for the judgments in $\Delta$ to depend on the judgments in $\Gamma$, the judgments in $\Gamma$ are not allowed to depend on the judgments in $\Delta$. 

Split contexts are frequently used in [[modal type theories]] such as [[spatial type theory]] and [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] in order to make [[comonadic]] [[modalities]] work. [[Mike Shulman]]'s real-cohesive homotopy type theory uses split contexts. 

In addition, split contexts are used in [[two-level type theory]] and [[type theory with shapes]].
