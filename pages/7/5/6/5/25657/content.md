## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]] with a notion of [[hom type]] (i.e. modelling [[(infinity,1)-category|$\infty$-categories]] as envisioned in [[directed homotopy type theory]]) and a notion of [[type universe]], the *directed univalence axiom* for a type universe $U$ states that given two $U$-small types $A \colon U$ and $B \colon U$ there is an [[equivalence of types]] between the hom-type $\mathrm{hom}_U(A, B)$ and the [[function type]] $A \to B$:

$$
  \mathrm{dua}_U(A, B)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathrm{hom}_U(A, B) 
    \,\simeq\, 
  (A \to B)
  \,.
$$

The definition also makes sense in analytic models of [[(infinity,1)-categories]] such as those constructed from [[simplicial sets]]. 

## Definition

### In simplicial homotopy type theory

In [[simplicial homotopy type theory]], let $A$ be a [[Segal type]] and let $x:A \vdash B(x)$ be a [[covariant type family]]. The covariant type family $x:A \vdash B(x)$ satisfies the **directed univalence axiom** if given two elements $x \colon A$ and $y \colon A$ there is an [[equivalence of types]] between the [[hom type]] $\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y)$ and the [[function type]] $B(x) \to B(y)$:

$$
  \mathrm{dua}_A(x, y)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathrm{hom}_A(x, y) 
    \,\simeq\, 
  (B(x) \to B(y))
  \,.
$$
