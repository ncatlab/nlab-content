A [[category]] is _locally small_ if each of its  [[homset|homsets]] is small, i.e., is a set instead of a proper class.

In general, a category is called "locally $P$" if all homsets (or hom-objects, if we are in [[enriched category theory]]) satisfy property $P$.

#Remarks#

The intuition that homsets capture the "local" aspects of the situation modeled by a category has its limitations and should not be taken too literally, especially when one is dealing with categories [[internalization|internal to]] spaces. A similar remark applies to [[discrete category]].
