A [[category]] is _locally small_ if each of its  [[hom-set|hom-sets]] is small, i.e., is a set instead of a proper class.

In general, a category is called "locally $P$" if all hom-sets (or [[hom-object]]s, if we are in [[enriched category theory]]) satisfy property $P$.

#Remarks#

The intuition that hom-sets capture the "local" aspects of the situation modeled by a category has its limitations and should not be taken too literally, especially when one is dealing with [[internal category|internal categories]] in spaces. Furthermore, this adjective is often used in the completely different sense of [[localization]], which has to do with [[slice category|slice categories]].
