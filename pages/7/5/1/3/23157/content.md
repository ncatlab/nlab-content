## Idea

In [[computer science]], the [[algorithm|algorithms]] for solving computational problems use resources proportional to the size of their inputs. A **complexity class** is a collection of problems which all can be solved with similar resource usage.

More generally, many [[model of computation|computers]] are restricted in what they can compute, even with unlimited resources. A complexity class for a computer is the collection of all problems which can be solved by a [[program]] on that computer.

A complexity class might be defined for [[decision problem|decision problems]], which only return true-or-false answers, but there are also definitions for [[function problem|function problems]].


## Definition 

### Classical

Fix a [[model of computation]]. Traditionally, we use the theory of [[Turing machine|Turing machines]]. The complexity class of this theory is the collection of all problems which can be [[decidability|decided]] by a term of the theory -- a [[program]] of the model of computation.

When the theory is Turing-complete, then we have the complexity class [[R]]. This class is composed of all problems whose answers form a [[recursive set]].

Let a polynomial time bound on a program be a [[polynomial]] in natural numbers which takes the size of an input and returns the number of [[beta-reduction|reductions]] required to compute the output. The theory of Turing machines with at least two tapes, restricted by polynomial time bounds, is associated with the complexity class [[PTIME]]. Similarly, there are exponential time bounds, and a corresponding complexity class [[EXPTIME]].

For an example of a complexity class naturally generated by a type of computer, consider the theory of deterministic finite-state [[automaton|automata]], or DFAs. Each DFA corresponds to a [[regular language]], and the DFAs form a complexity class [[REG]]. In terms of resource usage, REG corresponds to Turing machines using a constant amount of space.


### Descriptive

Fix a [[fragment]] of [[higher-order logic]]. A query is a predicate on finite structures which can be expressed in the fragment. The descriptive complexity class of the fragment is the collection of queries, and the size of each input is the size of the corresponding finite structure.

For the fragment of [[first-order logic]] with an added least [[fixed point]] operator, the descriptive complexity class is [[PTIME]]. Similarly, the fragment of [[second-order logic]] with a least fixed point operator gives the complexity class [[EXPTIME]].

Second-order logic with [[existential quantification]] but not [[universal quantification]] yields the complexity class [[NPTIME]].

## Examples

* The complexity class [[R]] corresponds to the height of computability according to the [[Church-Turing thesis]].

* The classes [[PTIME]] and [[NPTIME]] are clearly related, but the exact details are elusive. The question of [[P vs NP]] is central to computer science.

* The complexity class [[REG]] describes both deterministic and non-deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs and NFAs) because DFAs and NFAs are equivalent in computational power. In practice, this has led to the popularity of regular languages and [[regular expression|regular expressions]] in computer science. The [McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction) and [Glushkov's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glushkov%27s_construction_algorithm) send regular languages to equivalent NFAs, and [Kleene's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_algorithm) sends NFAs to equivalent regular languages.
