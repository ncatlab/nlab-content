## Idea

In [[solid state physics]] the _spin Hall effect_ refers to phenomena roughly analogous to the standard _[[Hall effect]]_, but with the role of [[electric charge]] played by [[spin]]-polarization of particles/excitations:

A material shows a _spin Hall effect_ if a [[current]] of [[spinning particles]]/excitation through the material induces a separation of particles of different spin polarization. This may happen either due to spin-dependent [[Mott scattering]] or due to intrinsic [[spin-orbit coupling]] ([Dyakonov-Perel 71](#DyakonovPerel71)) playing the 
role of the external [[magnetic field]] in the standard [[Hall effect]].

In particular, no external [[magnetic field]] is needed to induce a spin Hall effect; on the contrary, an a external magnetic field may suppress a spin Hall effect, due to the induced spin [[precession]] ([Dyakonov-Perel 71](#DyakonovPerel71)).
