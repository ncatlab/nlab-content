## Idea

The category of small covariant additive presheaves of abelian groups on an additive category contains
a subcategory of finitely presented (that is [[compact object|compact]]) objects. This subcategory
has a nice universal property.

## Definition

Let $T$ be an additive subcategory. An additive covariant presheaf is finitely presented if it is a cokernel of a morphism of corepresentables.
The full subcategory of object parts of these cokernels is $A(T)$, the Freyd's abelianization of $T$.
