#Idea#

A 'PROP' --- an abbreviation of 'products and permutations category' --- is a symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object, used to describe a given sort of algebraic structure.  One can think of PROPs as a variant of [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] suitable for noncartesian contexts.  In this respect they are similar to [[operad|operads]].  However, they are more general, because they can be used to describe operations with many outputs as well as many inputs.

#Definition#

A **PROP** is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] where every object is of the form 

$$x^{\otimes n} = x \otimes x \otimes \cdots \otimes x$$ 

for a single object $x$ and $n \ge 0$.

Given a PROP $T$ and a symmetric monoidal category $C$, a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$F : T \to C$$

is called an **algebra** or **model** of $T$ in $C$.  The category of algebras of $T$ in $C$, say $Alg(T,C)$, has

* symmetric monoidal functors $F : T \to C$ as objects,
* [[symmetric monoidal natural transformation|symmetric monoidal natural transformations]] as morphisms.

[arXiv:1207.2773] On the category of props
fra arXiv Front: math.AT av Philip Hackney, Marcy Robertson
The category of (colored) props is an enhancement of the category of colored
operads, and thus of the category of small categories. The titular category has
nice formal properties: it is bicomplete and is a symmetric monoidal category,
with monoidal product closely related to the Boardman-Vogt tensor product of
operads. Tools developed in this article, which is the first part of a larger
work, include a generalized version of multilinearity of functors, a free prop
construction defined on certain "generalized graphs", and the relationship
between the category of props and the categories of permutative categories and
of operads.
