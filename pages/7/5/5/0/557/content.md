#Idea#

A 'PROP' --- an abbreviation of 'products and permutations category' --- is a symmetric monoidal category generated by a single object, used to describe a given sort of algebraic structure.  One can think of PROPs as a variant of [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] suitable for noncartesian contexts.  In this respect they are similar to [[operad|operads]].  However, they are more general, because they can be used to describe operations with many outputs as well as many inputs.

#Definition#

A **PROP** is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] where every object is of the form 

$$x^{\otimes n} = x \otimes x \otimes \cdots \otimes x$$ 

for a single object $x$ and $n \ge 0$.

Given a PROP $T$ and a symmetric monoidal category $C$, a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$F : T \to C$$

is called an **algebra** or **model** of $T$ in $C$.  The category of algebras of $T$ in $C$, say $Alg(T,C)$, has

* symmetric monoidal functors $F : T \to C$ as objects,
* [[symmetric monoidal natural transformation|symmetric monoidal natural transformations]] as morphisms.
