## Idea

In as far as a [[computation]] is a [[function]] from input data to output result, a *reversible computation* is an [[invertible]] function, where the input may be recovered from knowledge of the output.
More generally, as far as a [[computation]] is any [[morphism]] (under the [[computational trilogy]]), a reversible computation is an *[[isomorphism]]*.



Typical operations of a [[classical computer]] are not reversible: For example standard logical gates such as [[AND]], [[XOR]] etc. are [[functions]] of the form $\{0,1\}^2 \longrightarrow \{0,1\}$ and as such not [[invertible]]. Standard classical gates which are invertible include the [[NOT]]-gate $\{0,1\} \xrightarrow{\sim} \{0,1\}$ (which switches its single input bit) and the [[CNOT]]-gate $\{0,1\}^2 \xrightarrow{\sim} \{0,1\}^2$ (which keeps the first "control" bit and switches the second bit if the first equals 1).

{#ExampleOfIncrementalAddition} Using just these reversible NOT- and CNOT-gates one may for instance implement the operation of *incremental [[addition]]* $(-)+n \;\colon\; \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathbb{Z}$ by a fixed [[natural number]] $n$ (e.g. [Kaye 2004](#Kaye04)). As opposed to binary addition $(-) + (-) \,\colon\, \mathbb{Z}^2 \xrightarrow{\;} \mathbb{Z}$, this operation is invertible, the [[inverse]] being the corresponding incremental [[subtraction]] $(-)-n \;\colon\; \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathbb{Z}$. 


This state of affairs was reflected, for instance, in [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s *[stepped reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner)* machine, which performs incremental addition when its crank is turned in one direction, and the inverse incremental subtraction when the crank is turned back in the opposite direction.

But the NOT- and CNOT-gates by themselves are not universal.
On the other hand, the [[CCNOT]] gate $\{0,1\}^3 \xrightarrow{\sim} \{0,1\}^3$ (which regards the first two inputs as control bits and switches the third input if these two are both 1) is both invertible as well as universal (e.g. [Nielsen & Chuang 2000, §1.4.1](#NielsenChuang00)), in that any function of the form $\{0,1\}^{n_1} \xrightarrow{\;} \{0,1\}^{n_2}$ is equal to a circuit of CCNOT gates pre-composed with some cartesian power of $\{0\} \xhookrightarrow{\;} \{0,1\}$ (introducing auxiliary "bath" or "ancilla" bits) and post-composed with some cartesian power of $\{0,1\} \to \ast$ (deleting auxiliary bits). In other words: Every irreversible classical computation on some computing system may be understood as a reversible computation on the system coupled to an ambient "bath" together with a loss of information of computation output into this bath.

Indeed, in terms of [[physics|physical]] implementation of computation, the distinction between reversible and irreversible computation is essentially that of reversible or irreversible dynamical processes as known from [[thermodynamics]]: Fundamentally and under idealized conditions, physical processes are invertible, but "at finite temperature" there is [[entropy]]-increase associated with most processes, making them irreversible. This relation between (non-)reversible computation and [[thermodynamics]] is known as *Landauer's principle* (due to [Landauer 1961](#Landauer61), review e.g. in [Nielsen & Chuang 2000, §3.2.5](#NielsenChuang00)).

While the notion of reversible computation was originally conceived in the context of classical computation, more recently its key example is understood to be *[[quantum computation]]*: Here the logical gates (*ex*cluding the final [[quantum measurement]] which [[wave function collapse|collapses]] the [[quantum state]]) are [[linear functions]] which are [[unitary operator]] and hence necessarily [[invertible]] (see [Frank 2003](#Frank03) for emphasis).

Therefore, the practical problem of implementing quantum computation faces analogous [[thermodynamics|thermodynamical]] issues as embodied by Landauer's principle, which are the reason for the need of [[quantum error correction]] and/or [[topological quantum computation|topological quantum stabilization]].
