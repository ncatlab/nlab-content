## Idea

By the general rules of $(n,r)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]], a __$(2,1)$-category__ is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] such that
*  any $j$-morphism is an [[equivalence]], for $j \gt 1$;
*  any two parallel $j$-morphisms are equivalent, for $j \gt 2$.

You can start from any notion of $\infty$-category, strict or weak; up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], the result can always be understood as a [[locally groupoidal 2-category|locally groupoidal]] $2$-[[2-category|category]].

## Models

So, a (2,1)-category is on partucular modeled by

* a [[2-category]] in which all [[2-morphisms]] are invertible;

* an [[(∞,1)-category]] that is 2-[[truncated]].
