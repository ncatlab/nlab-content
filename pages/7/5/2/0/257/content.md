#Idea#

A __model category__ (sometimes called a _Quillen model category_ or a _closed model category_) is a [[category]] equipped with extra structure which allows one to treat it as a presentation for an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]], i.e. as a model for [[homotopy theory]].

The idea of model categories is to work just with 1-morphisms instead of with $n$-morphisms for all $n$, but to carry around extra information to remember which 1-morphisms should become [[equivalence|equivalences]] in the full $(\infty,1)$-category, along with additional data which allows us to perform many $(\infty,1)$-categorical constructions at the level of the model category.

Most importantly, a model category is a [[category with weak equivalences]]. The collection of weak equivalences already determines the corresponding $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]]. The rest of the structure carried by a model category -- the choice of [[fibration]]s and [[cofibration]]s -- is auxiliary data whose purpose is to _facilitate computations_, in particular to facilitate the computation of the [[homotopy category]] and of [[derived functor]]s.  See [[homotopy theory]] for more details.


#Examples#

Historically, the most important examples have been the following.

* [[model structure on simplicial sets]]
* [[model structure on topological spaces]]
* [[model structure on chain complexes]]

Other model structures which at the moment we have entries for are

* [[folk model structure|model structure on omega categories]]
* [[folk model structure|model structure on omega-groupoids]]
