#Idea#

A _model category_ (more precisely: a category equipped with the structure of a (Quillen) model category) is a [[category]] equipped with extra structure which allows one to treat it like the 1-truncation of an $(\infty,1)$-[[infinity comma one category|category]], i.e. as a model for [[homotopy theory]]: 

the idea of model categories is to work just with 1-morphisms instead of with $n$-morphisms for all $n$, but to carry around extra information to remember which 1-morphisms are [[equivalence]]s in the full $(\infty,1)$-category, which behave like [[epimorphism]]s and which behave like [[monomorphism]]s, in some sense, with respect to the full $(\infty,1)$-category structure

Most importantly, a model category is a [[category with weak equivalences]]. The collection of weak equivalences already determines the corresponding $(\infty,1)$-[[infinity comma one category|category]]. The rest of the structure carried by a model category -- the choice of [[fibration]]s and [[cofibration]]s -- is auxiliary data whose purpose is to _facilitate computations_, in particular to facilitate the computation of the [[homotopy category]] and of [[derived functor]]s.


#Examples#


Historically the motivating example has been the 

* [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

Other model structures which at the moment we have entries for are

* [[folk model structure|model structure on omega categories]]

* [[folk model structure|model structure on omega-groupoids]]
