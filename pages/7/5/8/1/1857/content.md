> Note to contributors: If you create a page and later see some minor format changes together with a new a link to this page, the link is meant to help explain why we made the format change. Feel free to remove the link to this page once you are satisfied. We will periodically go around and clean, i.e. remove, links to this page, so you do not have to remove the link yourself if you don't want to be bothered.

#Idea#

This is a page containing a set of _explanations_ for common format changes we might make. These are not a set of _rules_ (we don't like rules). Any contributor is free to agree with the changes and leave them or disagree and rollback (or "undo") any format change.

The goal is to _first and foremost_ make the process of contributing content as easy as possible while at the same time creating at least a loose sense of homogeneity among pages. For the most part, any format changes we make will be minor cosmetic ones.

#Symbolic Links#

The most common formatting change we make is to change links such as

    [[(infinity,1)-category]]

to 

    [[(∞,1)-category]].

We might also change things like

    [[omega-groupoid]]

to 

    [[∞-groupoid]].

In some cases, a contributor may prefer the look of

    $\omega$-[[omega-groupoid|groupoid]].

If a contributor goes to the trouble of formatting a link this way, we will likely not change it.

See also [[redirect]].

#Plural Links#

Another very common format change we make is to change plural links such as

    [[groupoid]]s

to 

    [[groupoids]].

This change is made possible now that the nLab has the new [[redirect]] feature.

The current existence of many plural links such as 

    [[groupoid]]s

is an artifact from the time when we did not have [[redirects]].

In time, we hope to eliminate the legacy plural links with the "s" split from the singular link.
