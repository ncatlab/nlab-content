A $T$-complex is a higher-dimensional combinatorial structure with a class of designated [[thin element]]s.  The concept can be made sense of for various [[geometric shapes for higher structures|shapes]]:
* [[simplicial T-complex]];
* [[cubical T-complex]].

In general, the requirements are:
1. Every degenerate element is thin.
1. Every hollow shape has a unique thin filler.
1. If a thin element has every face but one also thin, then the last face is thin as well.
