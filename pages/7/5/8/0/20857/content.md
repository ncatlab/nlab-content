## Idea

A [[bound state]]/[[brane intersection]] of [[D0-branes]] with [[D2-branes]]. Special case of [[Dp-D(p+2) brane bound states]].


## Properties

### Myers effect

What is called the _[[Myers effect]]_ ([Myers 99](#Myers99)) in [[string theory]] is the claimed phenomenon that given $N$  [[D0-branes]] in a constant background [[RR field]] $F_4$ (the [[field strength]] associated with [[D2-brane]] [[D-brane charge|charge]]) with, crucially, nonabelian effects included, then these D0-branes expand into a [[fuzzy 2-sphere]] which represents a spherical [[D0-D2 brane bound state]] of a [[D2-brane]] and $N$ [[D0-branes]] ([Myers 99, section 6, see p. 22](#Myers99), [Myers 03, section 4](#Myers03)).
