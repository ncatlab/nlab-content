## Idea

**Counting quantifiers** generalize [[existential quantifiers]] in a logic with a notion of [[equality]].

* $(\exists^{\geq k}x)P(x)$: there exists at least $k$ elements such that $P$ holds,
* $(\exists^{=k}x)P(x)$: there exists exactly $k$ elements such that $P$ holds.

## Expressivity

Counting quantifiers increase the expressive power of [[two-variable logic]] while keeping the satisfiability problem [[decidable]].
