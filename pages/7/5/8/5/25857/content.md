## Idea

In [[string theory]] the term *solitonic brane* refers to [[brane]]-like solutions of [[equations of motion]] in ([[supergravity|super]]-)[[gravity]] whose presence is imprinted in topologically stable configurations of [[background fields]] of the ambient [[spacetime]], notably in the [[gravitational field]] and the [[higher gauge field]]-[[flux]] for which the brane is a source. This is in contrast to *[[fundamental branes]]* or *[[probe branes]]* described by [[sigma models]] with [[target space]] the given [[spacetime]], whose trajectories are effected by such [[background fields]] but which do not themselves [[backreaction|backreact]] on them.

More specifically, when the term "solitonic brane" was introduced in [Duff, Khuri & Lu 1992](#DuffKhuriLu92), [1994](#DuffKhuriLu94) and [Duff & Lu 1993](#DuffLu93), [1994](#DuffLu94) it referred concretely to "topologically stable" but *non-singular* [[supergravity]]-solutions, hence to those for which the [[background field]] [[field strength|strength]]/[[curvature]] is finite on all of [[spacetime]] as one may expect to be the case for *[[solitons]]* --- this in contrast to *singular-* or *[[black branes]]* whose would-be locus in spacetime is a "[[singularity]]" where these fields diverge, in higher dimensional generalization of the situation for [[black holes]].

However, while the term "solitonic brane" has become common place, authors often use it with somewhat different meaning.
(For better or worse, already the reference term *[[soliton]]* in [[field theory]] is used in a variety of neighbouring but different meanings.) 

Another convention &lbrack;[Stelle (1998)](#Stelle98), [Bergshoeff & Riccioni (2012)](#BergshoeffRiccioni12)&rbrack; is to say "solitonic" for the singular magnetically charged brane solutions (eg. the [[black brane|black]] [[NS5-brane]]) which are the [[electromagnetic duals]] to the "elementary" (namely just as singular but) electrically charged brane solutions (eg. the [[black string]]). In this convention the adjective "solitonic" is not distinguishing between singular/non-singular fields, but identifies the secondary magnetic sources for given primary degrees of freedom. For instance in this terminology and regarding the [[electron]] as the [[fundamental particle]] that it is, the [[magnetic monopole]] would be its "solitonic" dual version.

But nowadays many authors (eg. [Smith (2002), p. 5](#Smith02)) use "solitonic brane" to subsume all singular and non-singular brane-like supergravity solutions, hence use the term generally as the antonym to fundamental/elementary branes (a terminology that is not used fully consistently across authors, either), ie. as antonym to branes described by [[sigma-models]].
