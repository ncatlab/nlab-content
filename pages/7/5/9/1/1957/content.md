Let $A$ be an [[abelian group]] (or [[vector space]], velc; any object of a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[abelian category]] $C$ should do fine, and probably something more general than that).

The __exterior algebra__ (written $\bigwedge A$, $\Lambda A$, or $Alt A$) on $A$ is the [[free functor|free]] [[skew-commutative algebra]] on $A$ (where 'algebra' should be interpreted as a [[monoid object]] in $C$).  That is, the [[functor]] $Alt: C \to SCom Mon (C)$ is the [[left adjoint]] of the [[forgetful functor]] $SCom Mon (C) \to C$.  The elements of degree $p$ in this graded algebra comprise $Alt_p A$, the $p$th __exterior power__ of $A$.


In more detail, $Alt A$ is generated by the elements of $A$ (which comprise $Alt_1 A$) and these operations:

*  the operations (addition, scalar multiplication, etc) of the objects of $C$, generalising the operations in $A$,
*  an associative binary operation $\wedge$ of multiplication (the __exterior product__ or __wedge product__),

subject to these identities:

*  the identities necessary for $Alt A$ to be an object of $C$,
*  $\wedge$ distributes over these operations,
*  $x \wedge x = 0$ for $x \in A$.

A more general form of the last then follows; if $v \in Alt_p A$ and $w \in Alt_q A$ (that is if they are homogeneous of degree $p$ and degree $q$), then

*  $v \wedge v = 0$ if $p$ is odd,
*  $v \wedge w = (-1)^{pq}\, w \wedge v$.

That is, $Alt A$ is a skew-commutative algebra.


## Examples

In the following examples, it is somewhat traditional to have an inner product structure, so we mention it; but that structure is not necessary for forming the exterior algebra.

Let $A$ be $\mathbf{R}^3$.  Then an element of $Alt_0 A$ is a scalar (a [[real number]]), an element of $Alt_1 A$ is a vector in the elementary sense, an element of $Alt_2 A$ is a [[bivector]] (which we may identify with a [[pseudovector]] using the standard inner product on $A$), and an element of $Alt_3 A$ is (again using the inner product) a [[pseudoscalar]].

More generally, let $A$ be $\mathbf{R}^n$, or indeed any real [[inner product space]].  Then an element of $Alt_p A$ is a $p$-vector as studied in [[geometric algebra]].  Using the inner product, we can identify $p$-vectors with $(n-p)$-pseudovectors.

On a [[manifold]] (or [[generalized smooth space]]) $X$, let $A$ be the [[cotangent bundle]] of $X$.  (This is not really an object of any abelian category, but it is a [[vector bundle]] over $X$, and we can apply $Alt$ fibre-wise.)  Then a __[[differential form]]__ on $X$ is a [[section]] of the vector bundle $Alt A$.  If $X$ is a (semi)-[[Riemannian manifold]], then we can identify $p$-forms with $(n-p)$-forms using the [[Hodge star]].
