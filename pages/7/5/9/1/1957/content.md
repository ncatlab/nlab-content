#Idea#

The _exterior algebra_ of some object $V$ in a context with a [[tensor product]] is the _[[free object|free]] graded-commutative tensor algebra_ over $V$.

#Definition#

Let $A$ be an [[abelian group]] (or [[vector space]], velc; any object of a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[abelian category]] $C$ should do fine, and probably something more general than that).

The __exterior algebra__ (written $\bigwedge A$, $\Lambda A$, or $Alt A$) on $A$ is the [[free functor|free]] [[skew-commutative algebra]] on $A$ (where 'algebra' should be interpreted as a [[monoid object]] in $C$).  That is, the [[functor]] $Alt: C \to SCom Mon (C)$ is the [[left adjoint]] of the [[forgetful functor]] $SCom Mon (C) \to C$.  The elements of degree $p$ in this graded algebra comprise $Alt_p A$, the $p$th __exterior power__ (or $p$th __alternating power__) of $A$.

In more detail, $Alt A$ is generated by the elements of $A$ (which comprise $Alt_1 A$) and these operations:

*  the operations (addition, scalar multiplication, etc) of the objects of $C$, generalising the operations in $A$,
*  an associative binary operation $\wedge$ of multiplication (the __exterior product__ or __wedge product__),

subject to these identities:

*  the identities necessary for $Alt A$ to be an object of $C$,
*  $\wedge$ distributes over these operations,
*  $x \wedge x = 0$ for $x \in A$.

A more general form of the last then follows; if $v \in Alt_p A$ and $w \in Alt_q A$ (that is if they are homogeneous of degree $p$ and degree $q$), then

*  $v \wedge v = 0$ if $p$ is odd,
*  $v \wedge w = (-1)^{p q}\, w \wedge v$.

That is, $Alt A$ is a skew-commutative  algebra.



# Examples #

## over a vector space: Grassmann algebra ##

For $A = V$ a [[vector space]] or [[super vector space]], the exterior algebra $\bigwedge A$ is often called the **Grassmann algebra** over $V$

The **Grassmann algebra** $\Lambda V$ or $\wedge^\bullet V$ is the [[free object|free]] [[supercommutative algebra|graded commutative]] [[superalgebra]] on $V$.
 
Explicitly, for an ordinary [[vector space]] this is the quotient of the [[tensor algebra]] $T V$ by the [[ideal]] generated by elements of the form $v \otimes w + w \otimes v$.
For $V$ a [[graded vector space]] these elements are
$v \otimes w + (-1)^{deg v \cdot deg w } w \otimes v$.

The product in this algebra is denoted with a wedge, and called the **wedge product**.  In particular, if $v, w \in V$ for $V$ an ordinary  vector space we have in $\Lambda V$ the relation

$$v \wedge w = - w \wedge v \,.$$

For $V$ a graded vector space this is

$$
  v \wedge w = - (-1)^{deg v \cdot deg w} w \wedge v
  \,.
$$


### in the presence of an inner product ###

If $V$ is equipped with a [[bilinear form]] then there is also the [[Clifford algebra]] on $V$. This reduces to the Grassmann algebra for vanishing bilinear form. 

But sometimes it is useful to consider the Grassmann algebra even in the presence of a non-degenerate bilinear form, in which case the inner product still serves to induce identifications between elements of the Grassmann algebra in different degree.

Let $A$ be $\mathbf{R}^3$.  Then an element of $Alt_0 A$ is a scalar (a [[real number]]), an element of $Alt_1 A$ is a vector in the elementary sense, an element of $Alt_2 A$ is a [[bivector]] (which we may identify with a [[pseudovector]] using the standard inner product on $A$), and an element of $Alt_3 A$ is (again using the inner product) a [[pseudoscalar]].

More generally, let $A$ be $\mathbf{R}^n$, or indeed any real [[inner product space]].  Then an element of $Alt_p A$ is a $p$-vector as studied in [[geometric algebra]].  Using the inner product, we can identify $p$-vectors with $(n-p)$-pseudovectors.

On a [[manifold]] (or [[generalized smooth space]]) $X$, let $A$ be the [[cotangent bundle]] of $X$.  (This is not really an object of any abelian category, but it is a [[vector bundle]] over $X$, and we can apply $Alt$ fibre-wise.)  Then a __[[differential form]]__ on $X$ is a [[section]] of the vector bundle $Alt A$.  If $X$ is a (semi)-[[Riemannian manifold]], then we can identify $p$-forms with $(n-p)$-forms using the [[Hodge star]]


## semi-free dg-algebras ##

A [[semifree dga|semi-free dg-algebra]] is a [[dg-algebra]] whose underlying graded commutative algebra is free, i.e. is an exterior algebra. Examples include in particular [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s of [[Lie algebra]]s, of [[L-∞ algebra]]s and [[Lie-∞ algebroid]]s. 


### differential forms / deRham complex ###

For $X$ a [[manifold]] consider the category of [[module]]s over its [[ring]] of smooth functions $C^\infty(X)$. One such module is $\Omega^1(X) = \Gamma(T^* X)$, the space of smooth sections of the [[cotangent bundle]] of $X$.

The [[deRham complex]] of $X$ is the exterior algebra 

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X) = \bigwedge_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)
  \,.
$$

This is really a special case of the previous class of examples, as $\Omega^\bullet(X)$ equipped with the [[deRham complex|deRham differential]] is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the [[tangent Lie algebroid]].
