##Idea

A _convenient_ vector space is a [[locally convex topological vector space]] satisfying a certain [[completeness]] property.  Loosely, the completeness property is that "all derivatives which ought to exist actually do".

The term _convenient vector space_ was introduced by Kriegl and Michor as part of their theory of [[global analysis]].  It is equivalent to the notion _locally complete_ which is more usual in [[functional analysis]].


## Definition

There are various equivalent definitions of a __convenient vector space__; a long list is given in Theorem 2.14 of [KM](#KM).  We shall give the definition that is closest to its _raison d'&#234;tre_, namely the existence of derivatives.

###### Definition 
A [[locally convex topological vector space]] $E$ is said to be **convenient** or **$c^\infty$-complete** if whenever $c \colon \mathbb{R} \to E$ is a [[curve]] such that $l \circ c \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is [[smooth map|smooth]] for all $l \in E^*$ then $c$ is smooth.

We shall give one other characterisation which recasts the definition in language more common in functional analysis.

###### Definition
A [[locally convex topological vector space]], $E$, is said to be **locally complete** if for $B \subseteq E$ a [[bounded subset|bounded]], [[closed subset|closed]], [[absolutely convex subset]], its [[norm space]], $E_B$, is a [[Banach space]].
=--

The equivalence of these two forms part of Theorem 2.14 of [KM](#KM).

Other equivalent characterizations of convenient vector spaces $E$ are:

* $E$ is a [[locally convex vector space]] and every [[Mackey-Cauchy sequence]] in $E$ converges.

* $E$ is a [[locally convex vector space]] and for every [[smooth map|smooth]] [[curve]] $c : \mathbb{R} \to E$ there is a curve $\int c$ (an [[antiderivative]] of $c$) such that $c$ is the [[derivative]] of $\int c$.

See for instance ([Blute](#Blute)).


## Examples

* A [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ carries a unique structure of a convenient vector space. This also holds for [[Fréchet spaces]] in general and countable strict locally convex [[inductive limits]] thereof. (See [[LF-space]]).

* For $X$ and $Y$ two convenient vector spaces, the vector space of [[smooth functions]] $C^\infty(X,Y)$ is again a convenient vector space. This is to a large degree the motivating example. It makes the category of convenient vector spaces be [[cartesian-closed category|Cartesian closed]]. (See below).


## Properties

* The [[category]] of convenient vector spaces and [[smooth functions]] between them is a [[cartesian closed category]].

* The definition of a convenient vector space has a natural interpretation in terms of [[Frölicher spaces]]. It may also be related to [[synthetic differential geometry]]: convenient vector spaces form a [[full subcategory]] of the [[Cahiers topos]] ([Kock 86](#Kock86), [Kock-Reyes 86](#KockReyes86)) and in fact already of the topos of [[smooth sets]], hence (being [[concrete object|concrete]]) of the category of [[diffeological spaces]] ([Kock-Reyes 04, p. 5](#KockReyes04)).
