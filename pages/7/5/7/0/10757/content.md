## Idea

A _generalized Eilenberg-MacLane space_ is [[topological space]] of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[Cartesian product]] of (finitely many) [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]].

Accordingly a _generalized Eilenberg Mac-Lane spectrum_ is a [[spectrum]] equivalently to a [[smash product]] of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]].

## Applications

* Generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectra appear as [[coefficients]] in an [[Adams resolution]] used in the [[Adams spectral sequence]].
