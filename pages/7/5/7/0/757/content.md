#Definition#

Let $C$ be a catgeory equipped with a [[model category]] structure and let $S$ be a class of morphisms in $C$. 

The **left Bousfield localization** of $C$ with respect to $S$ is, if it exists, a [[model category]] structure $L_S C$ on $C$ such that

* the class of weak equivalenced of $L_S C$ equals the class of $S$-[[local equivalence]]s of $C$;

* the class of cofibrations of $L_S C$ equals that of $C$;

* the fibrations of $L_S C$ are precisely the morphisms with the right lifting property with respect to the $S$-[[local cofibration]]s of $C$.

Analogously the **right Bousfield localization** is defined as above, with the role of fibrations and cofibrations exchanged throughout.
