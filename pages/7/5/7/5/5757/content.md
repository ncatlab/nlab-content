Phil Ehlers was a postgraduate student (1989-1993) at Bangor, working in the team of [[Ronnie Brown]] and [[Tim Porter]], who was Phil's doctoral supervisor.

His MSc thesis was entitled: Simplicial Groupoids as Models 
for Homotopy Types.  (Thanks are due to [[Stephen Gaito]] for preparing a scanned version with Phil's permission.) Here are the details:

His PhD thesis was:

He has published several papers based on his work (jointly with Tim Porter).  these include:
