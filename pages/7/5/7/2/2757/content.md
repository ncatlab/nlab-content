## Idea

The **principle of induction** says that if a property of the 
[[natural numbers]] 

1. is [[true]] for $0 \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. if it is true for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then it is true for $n+1$;

then it is true for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The intuitive notion of a property is in practical mathematics identified with (belonging to) a subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{N}$. Thus the mathematical induction says that if $0\in S$ and if $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ $n\in S\implies n+1\in S$ then $S = \mathbb{N}$. This is the way in
the formal Dedekind-Peano arithmetics. Usually in logic one however uses a weaker form of induction which can be stated in a first order language (or in a type theory), namely where one limits to properties given by the predicates $P(n)$ [[dependent type|depending]] on natural numbers. The corresponding conclusion is the [[proposition]] $n \in \mathbb{N} \vdash P(n)$. 
The latter version of the principle of induction is weaker because there are only
$\aleph_0$ predicates but $2^{\aleph_0}$ subsets of $\mathbb{N}$.

When formulated in one of the formalizations below, one finds that the principle of induction for propositions depending on natural numbers is the simplest special case of a very general notion of induction over _[[inductive types]]_. Other examples are induction over [[lists]], [[trees]], terms in a [[logic]], and so on.


The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of _[[coinduction]]_.


## Formalization

### By initial algebras over endofunctors

The induction principle my neatly be formalized in terms of the notion of [[initial algebras of an endofunctor]].

In the [[category]] [[Set]], the [[initial algebra]] [[algebra for an endofunctor|for the endofunctor]] $F: X \to 1 + X$ is $\langle 0, s \rangle : 1 + \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of [[natural numbers]], $0$ is the smallest natural number, and $s$ is the [[successor]] operation. 

In terms of this the **principle of induction** is equivalent to saying that there is no proper [[subobject|subalgebra]] of $\mathbb{N}$; that is, the only subalgebra is $\mathbb{N}$ itself. This follows from the general property of [[initial objects]] that [[monomorphisms]] to them are [[isomorphisms]].
