## Statement

If $X$ is a set, $M$ is a [[Ïƒ-algebra]] on $X$, and $\mu$ is a [[signed measure]], i.e., a countably additive functional $M\to\mathbf{R}$, then $\mu$ is bounded and there is $S\in M$ such that

* $\mu(m)\ge0$ for every $m\in M$ such that $m\subset S$;

* $\mu(m)\le0$ for every $m\in M$ such that $m\cap S=\emptyset$.
