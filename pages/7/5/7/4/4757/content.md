## Idea

A [[continuous map]] $f : X \to Y$ from a [[manifold with boundary]] to some [[topological space]] $Y$ is said to have **sitting instants** if there is an open neighbourhood $\partial X \subset U \subset X$ of the boundary  such that the restriction of $f$ to that neighbourhood is constant on each connected component.
