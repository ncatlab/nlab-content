## Idea

The notion of _&#233;tale map_ is an abstraction of that of [[local homeomorphism]] in [[topology]].   The concept is usually found in places with a geometric or topological flavour.


## Examples

### Between topological spaces

An &#233;tale map between [[topological spaces]] is a  [[local homeomorphism]]; see [[étalé space]] (which is the total space of such a map viewed as a [[bundle]]).

### Between smooth manifolds

An &#233;tale map between [[smooth spaces]] is a [[local diffeomorphisms|local diffeomorphism]], which is in particular a [[local homeomorphism]] on the underlying [[topological spaces]].

### Between schemes (affine schemes / rings)

For an &#233;tale map between [[schemes]] see _[[étale morphism of schemes]]_.

Restricted to [[affine schemes]], this yields, [[Isbell duality|dually]], a notion of &#233;tale morphisms between [[rings]]. &#201;tale maps between noncommutative [[rings]] have also been considered.

### Between $E_\infty$-rings

* [[étale morphism of E-∞ rings]]

### Between analytic spaces

*  &#201;tale maps between [[analytic spaces]] are closely related to &#233;tale maps between schemes, while also (when the spaces are smooth) a special case of an &#233;tale map between smooth spaces.

Zoran: I do not understand this statement. Analytic spaces have a different structure sheaf; in general nilpotent elements are allowed. This is additional structure not present in theory of smooth spaces.

Toby: Is it correct now?

### Between toposes

* [[étale geometric morphism]]

### Between anabelioids

* [[finite étale morphism of anabelioids]]

### Between presheaves
Due to ([Joyal-Moerdijk 1994](#JoyalMoerdijk)): an étale map of presheaves is one which is [[cartesian natural transformation|cartesian]] *qua* natural transformation.

## Axiomatization

The idea of _&#233;tale morphisms_ can be axiomatized in any [[topos]]. This idea goes back to lectures by [[André Joyal]] in the 1970s. See ([Joyal-Moerdijk 1994](#JoyalMoerdijk)) and ([Dubuc 2000](#Dubuc)).
