An **inhabited set** or **occupied set** is one that contains an element.  [[constructivism|Constructively]] this is to be distinguished from a "nonempty" set which merely fails to not contain any elements (although some constructivists redefine "nonempty" to mean "inhabited").

In the [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]], an object $X$ is inhabited iff it is **well-supported**, meaning that $X\to 1$ is an epimorphism.  Note that this does not imply that $X$ has a [[global element]] unless the terminal object 1 is [[projective object|projective]].
