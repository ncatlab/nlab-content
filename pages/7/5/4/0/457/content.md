An **inhabited set** or **occupied set** is a [[set]] that contains an [[element]].

At least assuming [[classical logic]], this is the same thing as a set that is not [[empty set|empty]]. Usually inhabited sets are simply called 'non-empty', but the positive word 'inhabited' reminds us that this is the simpler notion, which emptiness is defined as the negation of.

The terms 'inhabited' and 'occupied' come from [[constructive mathematics]]. In constructive mathematics, a set that is not empty isn\'t necessarily inhabited, because [[double negation]] is nontrivial in [[intuitionistic logic]]. All the same, many constructive mathematicians use the old word 'non-empty' with the understanding that it *really* means inhabited.

There is a distinction between 'inhabited' and 'occupied' spaces in [[Abstract Stone Duality]] (which probably corresponds to something about [[locales]], should explain that here).

An inhabited set is the special case of an [[inhabited object]] in the [[topos]] [[Set]].
