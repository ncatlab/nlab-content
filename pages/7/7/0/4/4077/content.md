## Definition

A **simple group** is a [[group]] $G$ with exactly two [[quotient group]]s: the [[trivial quotient group]] $\{1\} \cong G/G$ and the group $G \cong G/\{1\}$ itself. 

Equivalently, a simple group is a group possessing exactly two [[normal subgroup|normal subgroups]]: the [[trivial subgroup]] $\{1\}$ and the group $G$ itself. 

Note that the [[trivial group]] does not itself count as simple, on the grounds that it has only *one* quotient group (or only one normal subgroup).  It may be possible to find authors that use "at most" in place of "exactly", thereby allowing the trivial group to be simple.  (Compare [[too simple to be simple]].)


## Properties

Simple groups are most commonly encountered in the theory of [[finite group]]s. Every finite group $G$ admits a [[composition series]], i.e., a finite filtration of subgroups 

$$1 = G_0 \subseteq G_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq G_n = G$$ 

where each inclusion $G_i \subseteq G_{i+1}$ is a [[normal subgroup]] and the quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ (called a **composition factor**) is simple. The condition of simplicity means that that the filtration cannot be further refined by addition of strict inclusions of normal subgroups. Furthermore, the [[Jordan-Hölder theorem]] ensures that any two composition series have the same length and the same composition factors (up to permutation). 

Thus finite simple groups are in some sense the primitive building blocks of finite groups generally. The massive program of classifying all finite simple groups was announced as completed by Daniel Gorenstein in 1983, although some doubts remained because there were some gaps in proofs. Most if not all the gaps are considered by experts in the area to have been filled, but there remain some notable skeptics, including for example [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[John H. Conway]] (verification needed here). See [[classification of finite simple groups]].
