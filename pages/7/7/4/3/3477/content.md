A **naturally parametrized smooth curve** is any parametrized smooth curve $s: I\to \mathbb{R}^n$, where $I\subset \mathbb{R}^+$ is an interval, such that the length of the arc from $s(t)$ to $s(t')$ for any $t\lt t'$, $t,t'\in I$ is $t'-t$. In other words, the parameter is the length of the curve counted from a given fixed point on the curve. Many classical formulas in the geometry of curves assume natural parametrization; otherwise the analogues in terms of general parametrizations become far more complicated.
