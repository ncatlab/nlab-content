## Idea and definition

If $C$ is a [[quasicategory]] and $W$ is a class of morphisms in $C$, then the __quasicategory of fractions__ is a functor $L\colon C\to C[W^{-1}]$ that has the following universal property: precomposition with $L$ identifies the quasicategory of functors $C[W^{-1}]\to D$ with the full subquasicategory of functors $C\to D$ that sends elements of $W$ to invertible morphisms in $D$.

## Terminology

In the existing literature on [[quasicategories]], some sources (like Lurie's [[Higher Topos Theory]]) do not assign a specific name to this concept and simply talk about it by saying that “$S^{-1}C$ is obtained from $C$ by inverting the morphisms of $S$”.
(See Warning 5.2.7.3 in [[Higher Topos Theory]].)

Other sources, like [[Cisinski]]'s [[Higher Categories and Homotopical Algebra]], use the term “localization” to refer to this concept, and refer to localizations in the sense of Lurie as “left Bousfield localizations”.
