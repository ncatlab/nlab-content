## Idea

A [[stack]] on a [[site]] $C$ is **geometric** if, roughly, it is a weak quotient of [[representable functor|representables]].

With $C$ fixed, instead of "geometric stack" one says, for instance

* for $C = $ [[Top]] -- topological stack;

* for $C = $ [[Diff]] -- [[differentiable stack]];

* for $C = $ [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ -- [[algebraic stack]];


## Definition


A [[stack]] $X$ is **geometric** if 

* it is quasi-compact (any open cover has a finite sub-cover) 

* the diagonal morphism $\Delta : X \to X \times X$ is 

  * an [[affine morphism of stacks]],

  * a [[representable morphism of stacks]].
