## Idea

A [[stack]] $X$ on a [[site]] $C$ is **geometric** if, roughly, it is [[representable functor|represented]] by a suitably well-behaved [[groupoid]] object $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{G}_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} \mathcal{G}_0)$ [[internal category|internal]] to $C$, i.e. if to an object $U \in C$ the stack assigns the (ordinary) [[groupoid]]

$$
  X : U \mapsto (C(U,\mathcal{G}_1) \stackrel{\to}{\to} C(U,\mathcal{G}_0))
  \,.
$$

A crucial difference between the groupoid object $\mathcal{G}$ in $C$ and the geometric stack $X$ is that the [[equivalence class]] of the stack in general contains _more_ (geometric) stacks than there are groupoid objects internally equivalent to $\mathcal{G}$: two groupoid objects with equivalent geometric stacks are called **Morita equivalent** groupoid objects. 

## Special cases

Geometric stacks for the following choices of sites $C$ are called

* for $C = $ [[Top]] -- [[topological stack]];

* for $C = $ [[Diff]] -- [[differentiable stack]];

* for $C = $ [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ -- [[algebraic stack]];

* for $C = $ [[complex manifold|CplxMfd]] -- [[complex analytic stack]];


## Definition

There are slight variations in the literature on what precisely is required of a [[stack]] $X$ on a [[site]] $C$  with [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical topology]] in order that it qualifies as **geometric**. 

A general requirement is that

1. the diagonal morphism $\Delta : X \to X \times X$ is a [[representable morphism of stacks]]

1. there exists an _atlas_ for the stack, in that there is a [[representable functor|representable]] $U \in C$ and a surjective morphism

  $$ 
    p : U \to X
    \,.
  $$

  This is necessarily itself representable, precisely if $\Delta_X$ is.

Further conditions are the following

* for $C = Sch_{et}$ the [[site]] of [[scheme]]s with the [[etale topology]]

  * $\Delta_X$ is required to be [[quasicompact]] and [[separated]]

  * for [[Deligne-Mumford stack]]s $p$ is moreover required to be etale

  * for [[Artin stack]]s $p$ is required to be [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]].

## Relation to groupoid objects

The _groupoid object_ associated to a geometric stack $X$ with atlas $p : U \to X$ is the [[Cech groupoid of a functor|Cech groupoid]] of $p$ (this is simply the Cech groupoid of $p$ seen as a singleton cover) defined by $\mathcal{G}_0 := U$ and $\mathcal{G}_1 = U \times_X U$, where the latter is the 2-categorical [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
   \mathcal{G}_1 &\stackrel{s}{\to}& U
   \\
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{t}} &{}^{\simeq}\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
   \\
   U &\to& X
  }
$$
