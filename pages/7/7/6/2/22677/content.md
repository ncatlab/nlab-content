## Idea

For $A$ and $B$ two [[commutative monoids]],
their _tensor product_ $A \otimes B$ is a new commutative monoid
such that a [[monoid homomorphism]] $A \otimes B \to C$
is equivalently a [[bilinear map]] out of $A$ and $B$. 

Another way to think of it is that commutative monoid maps $A \otimes B \to C$ are in natural bijection with commutative monoid maps $A \to [B, C]$, where $[B, C]$ is the set of commutative monoid maps $B \to C$ provided with the pointwise-defined commutative monoid structure. 

## Definition
 {#Definition}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let [[CMon]] be the collection of [[commutative monoids]], regarded as a [[multicategory]] whose [[multimorphisms]] are the [[multilinear maps]] $A_1, \cdots, A_n \to B$.

The [[tensor product]] $A, B \mapsto A \otimes B$ in this multicategory is the **tensor product of commutative monoids**.

=--

Equivalently this means explicitly:

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitTensorProduct}
###### Definition

For $A, B$ two [[commutative monoids]], their **tensor product of commutative monoids** is the commutative monoid $A \otimes B$ which is the [[quotient]] of the [[free commutative monoid]] on the [[product]] of their underlying sets $A \times B$
by the [[generators and relations|relations]] 

* $(a_1,b)+(a_2,b)\sim (a_1+a_2,b)$ 

* $(a,b_1)+(a,b_2)\sim (a,b_1+b_2)$

* $(0,b)\sim 0$

* $(a,0)\sim 0$

for all $a, a_1, a_2 \in A$ and $b, b_1, b_2 \in B$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #TheCanonicalMap}
###### Remark

By definition of the [[free construction]] and the [[quotient]] there is a canonical [[function]] of the underlying sets

$$
  p_{A,B}
  \;\colon\;
  U(A) \times U(B) 
  \overset{}{\longrightarrow} 
  U(A \otimes B)
$$

(where $U \colon CMon \to Set$ is the [[forgetful functor]]).

On elements this sends $(a,b)$ to the equivalence class that it represents under the above equivalence relations.

=--

The following relates the tensor product to [[bilinear functions]]. It is a definition or a proposition depending on whether one takes the notion of bilinear function to be defined before or after that of tensor product of commutative monoids.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition/Proposition

A [[function]] of underlying sets $f : A \times B \to C$
is a [[bilinear function]] precisely if it factors by the morphism of \ref{TheCanonicalMap} through a [[monoid homomorphism]] $\phi : A \otimes B \to C$ out of the tensor product:

$$
  f : A \times B \stackrel{\otimes}{\to}    
      A \otimes B
      \stackrel{\phi}{\to}
      C
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Symmetric monoidal closed category structure


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Equipped with the tensor product $\otimes$ of def. \ref{ExplicitTensorProduct} and the exchange map $\sigma_{A, B}: A\otimes B \to B \otimes A$ generated by $\sigma_{A, B}(a, b) = (b, a)$, [[CMon]] becomes a [[symmetric monoidal category]]. 

The [[unit object]] in $(CMon, \otimes)$ is the additive monoid of [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that $\mathbb{N}$ is the unit object, consider for any commutative monoid $A$ the map

$$
  A \otimes \mathbb{N} \to A
$$

which sends for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  (a, n) \mapsto n \cdot a \coloneqq \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{n\;summands}
  \,.
$$

Due to the quotient relation defining the tensor product, the element on the left is also equal to 

$$
  (a, n) = (a, \underbrace{1 + 1 \cdots + 1}_{n\; summands})
  =
  \underbrace{ (a,1) + (a,1) + \cdots + (a,1) }_{n\; summands}
  \,.
$$

This shows that $A \otimes \mathbb{N} \to A$ is in fact an [[isomorphism]].

Showing that $\sigma_{A, B}$ is natural in $A, B$ is trivial, so $\sigma$ is a braiding. $\sigma^2$ is identity, so it gives CMon a symmetric monoidal structure.

=--

Notice the symmetry or braiding provides a natural isomorphism $A \otimes - \cong - \otimes A$. 

The symmetric monoidal structure is naturally seen as adjoint to a [[monoidal closed category|closed]] structure, where the [[internal hom]] $[B, C]$ of commutative monoids, whose underlying set consists of commutative monoid maps $f: B \to C$, is defined in pointwise fashion: 

$$(f + g)(b) \coloneqq f(b) + g(b), \qquad 0_{[B, C]}(b) \coloneqq 0_C.$$ 

That $f+g$ so defined is a homomorphism uses commutativity in the monoid $C$: 

$$(f + g)(b + b') \coloneqq f(b + b') + g(b + b') = f(b) + f(b') + g(b) + g(b') = f(b) + g(b) + f(b') + g(b') = (f + g)(b) + (f + g)(b').$$ 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every B, there is an [[adjunction]] $- \otimes B \dashv [B, -]$, 

$$CMon(A \otimes B, C) \cong CMon(A, [B, C]),$$ 

i.e., maps $A \to [B, C]$ are in natural bijection with maps $A \otimes B \to C$. 

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given $f: A \to [B, C]$, define $f^\vee: A \otimes B \to C$ by $f^\vee(a \otimes b) = f(a)(b)$. The linearity of $f^\vee$ in the second argument $b$ follows from the fact that $f(a): B \to C$ is a linear map. The linearity in the first argument follows from the fact that $f$ is itself linear, and the pointwise-defined structure of $[B, C]$: 

$$f^\vee((a + a') \otimes b) = f(a + a')(b) = (f(a) + f(a'))(b) \coloneqq f(a)(b) + f(a')(b) = f^\vee(a \otimes b) + f^\vee(a' \otimes b).$$ 

In the other direction, given $g: A \otimes B \to C$, define $g^\wedge: A \to [B, C]$ by $g^\wedge(a)(b) = g(a \otimes b)$. The linearity of $g^\wedge$ follows from an argument similar to the one in the paragraph above. The fact that the assignments $f \mapsto f^\vee$ and $g \mapsto g^\wedge$ are mutually inverse is obvious. 

=-- 

Since $- \otimes A$ and its isomorph $A \otimes -$ are thus [[left adjoint]] functors, and since left adjoints preserve coproducts, we also have the following result. 


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The tensor product of commutative monoids [[distributivity|distributes]] over the [[biproduct]] of commutative monoids

$$
  A \otimes \oplus_{s \in S} B_s
  \simeq
  \oplus_{s \in S} ( A \otimes B_s )
  \,.
$$

=--

### Monoids

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[monoid]] in $(CMon, \otimes)$ is equivalently a [[rig]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $(A, \cdot)$ be a [[monoid]] in $(CMon, \otimes)$. The fact that the multiplication

$$
  \cdot : A \otimes A \to A
$$

is bilinear means by the above that for all $a_1, a_2, b \in A$ we have

$$
  (a_1 +  a_2) \cdot b = a_1 \cdot b  + a_2 \cdot b
$$

$$
  b \cdot (a_1 +  a_2) = b \cdot a_1 + b \cdot a_2 
  \,.
$$

$$
  0 \cdot b = 0
  \,.
$$

$$
  b \cdot 0 = 0
  \,.
$$
  

This is precisely the [[distributivity law]] and [[absorption law]] of the rig.

=--

## In $(\infty,1)$-category theory

The assignment $\mathcal{C} \mapsto \mathrm{CMon}(\mathcal{C})$ satisfies base change for [[presentable (∞,1)-categories]], i.e.
$$
  \mathcal{C} \otimes \mathrm{CMon}(\mathcal{S}) \simeq \mathrm{CMon}(\mathcal{S}).
$$

In particular, $\mathrm{CMon}(S)$ is a [[mode]];
this implies that for $\mathcal{C}$ a presentably symmetric monoidal(∞,1)-category, $\mathrm{CMon}(\mathcal{C})$ possesses a unique symmetric monoidal structure subject to the condition that the free functor
$$
  \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{CMon}(\mathcal{C})
$$
is symmetric monoidal.
