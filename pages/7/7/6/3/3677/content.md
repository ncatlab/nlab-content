* [[Daniel Dugger]], _[[DuggerUniv.pdf:file]]_  

This discusses the _projective_ global and local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. 

In particular this 

* announces the statement of **[Dugger's theorem](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/combinatorial+model+category#DuggerTheorem)** which states that every [[combinatorial model category]] arises as the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the projective [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. The full proof of this is in the companion article

  * Daniel Dugger, _Combinatorial model categories have presentations_ ([arXiv:math/0007068](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0007068)).

* discusses [cofibrant replacement in the projective model structures](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+simplicial+presheaves#FibAndCofibObjects) (necessarily both for the global as well as for the local structure)

* discusses _geometric realization_ of $\infty$-stacks on [[Diff]] essentially by using the geometric homotopy $\infty$-groupoid functor as disscussed at [[homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]].

The general discussion is in parts is based on the unfinished but useful notes
