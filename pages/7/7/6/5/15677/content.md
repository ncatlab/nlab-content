##Definition 

The ideal class group $C_K$ of a number field $K$ is defined as the group of fractional ideals of $\mathcal{O}_K$ modded out by the group of principal ideals in $\mathcal{O}_K$ (both groups freely generated as $K$-modules). An equivalent definition is that $C_K$ := $Pic(Spec \text{ } \mathcal{O}_K)$.

This was created to measure how far $\mathcal{O}_K$ is from being a PID.  

More generally, for $R$ a Dedekind domain, we define $C_R$ to be the group of fractional ideals of $R$ modded out by the group of principal ideals (freely generated as $Frac(R)$-modules). In other words, $C_R$ := $Pic(Spec \text{ } R)$.

## Properties


### Relation to the idele class group

A much larger variant of the ideal class group is the [[idele class group]]...

### Relation to the pole of the zeta function

The [[Dedekind zeta function]] $\zeta_K$ of the [[number field]] $K$ has a [[simple pole]] at $s = 1$. The _[[class number formula]]_ says that its [[residue]] there is proportional the the product of the [[regulator of a number field|regulator]] with the [[class number]] of $K$

$$
  \underset{s\to 1}{\lim} (s-1) \zeta_K(s)
  \propto
  ClassNumber_K \cdot Regulator_K
  \,.
$$
