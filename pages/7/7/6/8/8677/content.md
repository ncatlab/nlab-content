## Idea

### General

Given a (possibly noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $R$ there are many situations when certain elements or matrices can be inverted in a universal way obtaining a new "localized" ring $S^{-1}R$ equipped with a localization [[homomorphism]] $R\to S^{-1}R$ under which all elements in $S$ are mapped to multiplicatively invertible elements ([[units]]). The latter property must be modified for Cohn localization at multiplicative set of matrices. 

We can typically invert elements in a left or right Ore subset $S\subset R$ or much more generally some multiplicative set or matrices ([[Cohn localization]]) etc. There are also some specific localizations like Martindale localizations in ring theory. 


## Definition

### For general rings

Let $S$ be a subset of a ring $R$.   A ring homomorphism $f:R \to A$ is _$S$-inverting_ if the image of $S$ is contained in the units of $A$, i.e. for every $s \in S$ there is a $t \in A$ so that $tf(s) = 1 = f(s) t$.   The _localization of $R$ with respect to $S$_ is a ring homomorphism $h : R \to R_S$ which is initial with respect to $S$-inverting ring homomorphisms.   The localization is therefore unique up to isomorphism.   It is a special case of [[universal localization]] and is the result of a formal construction. 

The localization of a ring at a multiplicative submonoid $S$ which contains $0$ is the [[trivial ring]]. 

If $S$ is an [[Ore set]], then the localization of $R$ with respect to $S$ has an explicit description in terms of fractions, see  [[Ore localization]].
