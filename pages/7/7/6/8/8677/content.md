## Idea

Given a (possibly noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $R$ there are many situations when certain elements or matrices can be inverted in a universal way obtaining a new "localized" ring $S^{-1}R$ equipped with a localization [[homomorphism]] $R\to S^{-1}R$ under which all elements in $S$ are mapped to multiplicatively invertible elements ([[units]]). The latter property must be modified for Cohn localization at multiplicative set of matrices. 

We can typically invert elements in a left or right Ore subset $S\subset R$ or much more generally some multiplicative set or matrices ([[Cohn localization]]) etc. There are also some specific localizations like Martindale localizations in ring theory.
