## Idea

### General

Given a (possibly noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $R$ there are many situations when certain elements or matrices can be inverted in a universal way obtaining a new "localized" ring $S^{-1}R$ equipped with a [[localization]] [[homomorphism]] $R\to S^{-1}R$ under which all elements in $S$ are mapped to multiplicatively [[invertible elements]] ([[units]], hence elements of the [[group of units]]). 

This is a special case of and generalizes to the notion of *[[Cohn localization]]* where one may also force certain [[matrices]] with [[coefficients]] in the ring to become invertible.

Often one inverts elements in a left or right [[Ore subset]] $S\subset R$ in which case the localized ring is expressed by fractions as naively expected, called *[[Ore localization]]*. 

The Ore-condition is automatic for [[commutative rings]] which leads to the notion of *[[localization of a commutative ring]]*.

Another special case is known as *[[Martindale localization]]*.



## Definition

### For general rings

Let $S$ be any [[subset]] of a [[ring]] $R$.  

Say that a ring [[homomorphism]] $f \colon R \to A$ is _$S$-inverting_ if the [[image]] of $S$ under $f$ is contained in the [[units]] $A^\times \subset A$, i.e. if for every $s \in S$ there is a $t \in A$ so that $t \cdot f(s) = 1 = f(s) \cdot t$ in $A$. 

Then the _localization of $R$ with respect to $S$_ is a ring homomorphism $h \colon R \to R_S$ which is [[initial object|initial]] with respect to such $S$-inverting ring homomorphisms.  

By this defining [[universal property]] the localization is unique up to [[isomorphism]], when it exists.  Its existence is a special case of [[universal localization]]/[[Cohn localization]], a general abstract construction. 

If $S$ is an [[Ore set]], then the localization of $R$ with respect to $S$ has an explicit description in terms of fractions, see at *[[Ore localization]]*. 

## Examples

* The localization of a ring at a multiplicative submonoid $S$ which contains $0$ is the [[trivial ring]].
