###### Proposition
**([[Quillen adjunction between simplicial sets and connective dgc-algebras]])**

The [[PL de Rham complex]]-construction is the [[left adjoint]] in a [[Quillen adjunction]] between

* the [[opposite model structure|opposite]] of the [[projective model structure on connective dgc-algebras]]

* the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]]

###### Proof

That the [[PL de Rham complex]] [[functor]] preserves [[cofibrations]], hence sends injections of simplicial sets to surjections of dgc-algebras, is immediate from its construction.

That its [[right adjoint]] preserves fibrations, hence sends cofibrations of dgc-algebras to [[Kan fibrations]], is the statement of [Bousfield-Gugenheim 76, Lemma 8.2](#BousfieldGugenheim76).
