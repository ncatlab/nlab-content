Let $A$ and $B$ be [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]]. The category $[A,B]$ of **$(A,B)$-bimodels** and their homomorphisms is the category of $A$-models and homomorphisms in $B Mod^{op}$. An alternative description is that is a co-$A$-model in $B Mod$. Each such bimodel $M$ determines and is determined by a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$Hom_B(M,-): B Mod \to A Mod$$

$$M\otimes_A -: A Mod \to B Mod$$

Composition of such adjoint pairs yields a functor

$$\otimes_B: [B,C]\times [A,B] \to [A,C]$$

The category $[A,A]$ has a unit object -- it would be churlish not to overload our notation yet further by calling it $A$, corresponding to the fact that the free $A$-model on one generator has a canonical co-$A$-structure.
