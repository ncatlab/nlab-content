## Idea

The **Münchhausen trilemma** or the **Agrippan trilemma** is a thought experiment in [[epistemology]] which states that it is theoretically impossible to prove any truth, because one has to resort to one of three unsatisfactory arguments

* Circular reasoning, in which the proof of a statement relies on said statement itself

* Infinite regress, in which one needs an [[infinite sequence]] of statements, each of which proves the previous statement

* Foundationalism, in which one selects some statements as unjustified axioms or rules. 

## Relevance to the foundations of mathematics

The [[foundations of mathematics]] by definition uses foundationalism to resolve the Münchhausen trilemma in [[mathematics]]. However, different communities of mathematicians disagree with which unjustified axioms and rules to use for their foundations. For example, classical mathematicians use [[classical logic]], while constructive mathematicians use [[intuitionistic logic]] and reject [[excluded middle]]. 

Subfields of mathematics also use foundationalism by way of [[synthetic mathematics]], in which unjustified axioms and rules are used as a basic foundation for the entire subfield. Examples include [[synthetic topology]], [[synthetic geometry]], [[synthetic differential geometry]], and [[synthetic (infinity,1)-category theory]].
