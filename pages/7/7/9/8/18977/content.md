The **principle of compositionality** asserts that the nature of complex structures is entirely determined by that of their simpler parts and the way these are composed.

In the context of the [[semantics]] of languages, this is sometimes called **Frege's principle** after [[Gottlob Frege]], although it was arguably assumed in [Boole 1854](#Boole1854), decades before Frege's work, and possibly not even embraced by Frege (see [Pelletier 01](#Pelletier01)).

Taking up [[Alfred Tarski|Alfred Tarski's]] work on the theory of  _[[truth]]_ in [[object languages]] with respect to [[metalanguages]] ([Tarski 35](#Tarski35)), the concept became popular in [[linguistics]] with the formalization of [[semantics]] of formal and informal languages via [[Montague semantics]]
([Montague 70a](#Montague70a),
[Montague 70b](#Montague70b),
[Montague 73](#Montague73)), where the principle asserts that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. 



### In computation

From [Compositionality 16](#Comp16): 

> The compositional description of complex objects is a fundamental feature of the logical structure of [[computation]]. The use of logical languages in database theory and in algorithmic and finite model theory provides a basic level of compositionality, but establishing systematic relationships between compositional descriptions and complexity remains elusive. Compositional models of probabilistic systems and languages have been developed, but inferring probabilistic properties of systems in a compositional fashion is an important challenge. In quantum computation, the phenomenon of entanglement poses a challenge at a fundamental level to the scope of compositional descriptions. At the same time, compositionally has been proposed as a fundamental principle for the development of physical theories.

### General

The principle is regarded as originating, at least implicitly, in

* {#Boole1854} [[George Boole]], _An Investigation of the Laws of Thought On Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities_, Cambridge University Press 1854 ([doi:10.1017/CBO9780511693090](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511693090), [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laws_of_Thought))

The common attribution to [[Gottlob Frege]] has been called into question:

* {#Pelletier01} Francis Jeffry Pelletier, _Did Frege Believe Frege's Principle?_, Journal of Logic, Language and Information,  10, 87–114 (2001) ([doi:10.1023/A:1026594023292](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026594023292))

The principle was promoted in [[linguistics]] via [[Montague semantics]]:

* {#Montague70a} [[Richard Montague]], _English as a formal language_, Linguaggi nella societa e nella tecnica. Edizioni di Communita. pp. 188-221 (1970) ([[MontagueEnglishFormalLanguage.pdf:file]])

* {#Montague73} [[Richard Montague]], _The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English_, Approaches to Natural Language (1973) ([[MontagueQuantification.pdf:file]])

Montague relied on 

* {#Tarski35} [[Alfred Tarski]], 1935, _The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages_, in Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics, Indianapolis: Hackett 1983, 2nd edition, 152–278.

A concise and formal discussion of this tradition is

* Theo Janssen, _Compositionality_ , ch.7 of van Benthem/ter Meulen (eds.), _Handbook of Logic and Language_ , North-Holland Amsterdam 1997.

A somewhat critical reassessment of the concept from a mathematical POV is the monograph
