There are two different notions of a dense subcategory:

1. a subcategory $D\subset C$ is __dense__ if every object in $C$ is canonically a colimit of objects in $D$.  More details, see the entry on the more general notion of [[dense functor]] (or better, the relevant section of [[Categories Work]]) and for the equivalent notion of (Isbell) [[adequate subcategory]] which is used in connection to the notions of [[nerve]], [[geometric realization]] and [[singular functor]].

2. a subcategory $D\subset C$ is __dense__ if every object $c$ of $C$ has a $D$-expansion, that is a morphism $c\to\bar{c}$ of [[pro-object]]s in $D$ which is universal among all morphisms of pro-objects in $D$ with source $c$. This second notion is used in [[shape theory]].
