## Idea

The __denial inequality__ is the [[negation]] of [[equality]].

This is a term found in [[constructive mathematics]], to distinguish from [[tight inequality relations]] such as [[tight apartness relations]]. In [[classical mathematics]], denial inequalities and [[tight inequality relations]] are the same and are simply called "inequality", so the notion plays no further role classically. 

If one wishes to reserve the word "inequality" for [[order]] relations (such as $\le$ and $\lt$), then one may instead use the word **disequality** to refer to the denial inequality.  (For instance, this is common in [[type theory]] with [[subtype]] relations that form an ordering on the [[types]].)
