## Idea

The complex/oriented/etc. **cobordism ring** is the [[ring]] whose 

* elements are [[cobordism]] classes of [[manifold]]s with complex/orientation/etc. structure;

* product operation is given by the [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds;

* addition operation is given by the [[disjoint union]] of manifolds.
