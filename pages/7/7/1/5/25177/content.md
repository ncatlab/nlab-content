## Idea

In [[material set theory]], an [[anti-ideal]] of a [[commutative ring]] $R$ with an [[apartness relation]] $\#$ is an $\#$-[[open subset]] $I \subseteq R$ which satisfies 

* $\neg(0 \in I)$
* for all $x \in R$ and $y \in R$, $x + y \in I$ implies that $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ 
* for all $x \in R$ and $y \in R$, $x \in I$ and $y \in I$ implies that $x \cdot y \in I$ 

In [[dependently sorted set theory]], where membership $x \in S$ is not a [[relation]], the above statement that $x \in I$ for every element $x \in R$ in material set theory is equivalently a predicate in the logic $x \in R \vdash P_I(x)$. The given [[anti-ideal]] $I$ is then defined by [[restricted separation]] as the set $I \coloneqq \{x \in R \vert P_I(x)\}$, which in structural set theory automatically comes with an [[injection]] 
$$i:\{x \in R \vert P_I(x)\} \hookrightarrow R$$
such that
$$\exists y \in \{x \in R \vert P_I(x)\}.x = i(y) \iff P(x)$$
Hence, the notion of [[anti-ideal]] predicate, a formulation of the notion of anti-ideal as a predicate rather than a subset. 

## Definition

Given a commutative ring $R$ with an [[apartness relation]] $\#$, an **anti-ideal predicate** on $R$ is an $\#$-[[apartness-open predicate|open predicate]] $x \in R \vdash P_I(x)$ which satisfies

* $\neg P_I(0)$
* for all $x \in R$ and $y \in R$, $P_I(x + y)$ implies that $P_I(x)$ or $P_I(y)$
* for all $x \in R$ and $y \in R$, $P_I(x)$ and $P_I(y)$ implies that $P_I(x \cdot y)$ 

The **[[anti-ideal]]** $I$ is then defined by [[restricted separation]] as
$I \coloneqq \{x \in R \vert P_I(x)\}$

## Examples

The various definitions of anti-ideals translate over from material set theory to anti-ideal predicates in dependently sorted structural set theory by replacing $x \in I$ with $P_I(x)$ throughout the definition:

* A **[[proper anti-ideal]] predicate** on a commutative ring $R$ with apartness relation $\#$ is an anti-ideal predicate $P_I$ where $P_I(1)$ is true. 
* A **[[anti-prime anti-ideal]] predicate** on a commutative ring $R$ with apartness relation $\#$ is a proper anti-ideal predicate $P_I$ where for all $x \in R$ and $y \in R$, $P_I(x)$ and $P_I(y)$ implies that $P_I(x \cdot y)$.
$$\forall x \in R.\forall y \in R.P_I(x) \wedge P_I(y) \implies P_I(x \cdot y)$$ 
* A **[[principal anti-ideal]] predicate** on a commutative ring $R$ with apartness relation $\#$ anti-generated by an element $a \in R$ is an ideal predicate $P_I$ where for all $x \in R$ and for all $y \in R$, $P_I(x)$ implies that $x \# a \cdot y$.
$$\forall x \in R.\forall y \in R.P_I(x) \implies x \# a \cdot y$$
