The term _Connes fusion_ for the operation originally defined by Alain is used at least since the article

* Antony Wassermann, _Operator algebras and conformal field theory III_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/9806031)) .

A useful review of Connes fusion observing some simplifications is

* Andreas Thom, _A remark about the Connes fusion tensor product_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/0601045))
