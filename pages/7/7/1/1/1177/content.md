The fusion operation on Hlbert modules of von Neumann algebras has been described in

* A. Connes, On the spatial theory of von Neumann algebras, J. of functional analysis 35 (1980) 153--164;

and in 1983 studied further by V. Jones in context of subfactors. 

The term _Connes fusion_ for this operation is used at least since the article

* Antony Wassermann, _Operator algebras and conformal field theory III_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/9806031)) .

A useful review of Connes fusion observing some simplifications is

* Andreas Thom, _A remark about the Connes fusion tensor product_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/0601045))

An attempt to summarize that in a blog entry is [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000718.html)

Much earlier usage of the term...I remember that by 1999 what is just a bit after the Wasserman's article it was well-established term, used by people who certainly did not read his article. It was widely used at the school on operator algebras in August 2000, and you can find mention in the context of subfactors in MR97i:46112. -- Zoran

R. M Brower and N. P. Landsman described a [[bicategory]] of von Neumann algebras, Connes' correspondences as morphisms and (bounded) intertwiners as 2-cells. They proved that the equivalence in that bicategory is the same as usual Morita equivalence of von Neumann algebras as studied by M. Rieffel and others.
