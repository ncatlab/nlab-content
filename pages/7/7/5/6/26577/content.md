## Idea

In elementary [[probability theory]], [[Bayes' formula]] refers to a version of the formula 
$$
   P(A)\,P(B|A) \,=\, P(B)\,P(A|B)
   \,,
$$
and relates the [[conditional probability]] of $B$ given $A$ to the one of $A$ given $B$.

From the [[category-theoretic probability|category-theoretic point of view]], this formula expresses a duality, sometimes called **Bayesian inversion**, which often gives rise to a [[dagger category|dagger structure]].


## Intuition

In logical reasoning, implications in general cannot be reversed: $A \to B$, alone, does not imply $B\to A$. 

In [[probability theory]], instead, conditional statements exhibit a [[duality]] which is absent in pure logical reasoning.

Consider for example a city in which *all taxis are yellow*. (The implication is $taxi\to yellow$.)
If we see a yellow car, of course we can't be sure it's a taxi. However, it's *more likely* that it's a taxi compared to a randomly colored car. This increase in likelihood is larger if the fraction of yellow cars is small. Indeed, [[Bayes' rule]] says that 
$$
P(taxi|yellow) = \frac{P(yellow\,taxi)}{P(yellow)} = \frac{P(taxi)}{P(yellow)} .
$$

More generally, in a city where *most* taxis are yellow, there is a high conditional probability that a given taxi is yellow,
$$
P(yellow|taxi) .
$$
The higher this probability is, the higher is the probability that a given yellow car is a taxi, again according to [[Bayes' rule]]:
$$
P(taxi|yellow) = \frac{P(yellow\,taxi)}{P(yellow)} = \frac{P(taxi)\,P(yellow|taxi)}{P(yellow)}
$$

In [[categorical probability]], this phenomenon can be modeled by saying that to each "conditional" morphism in the form $\{taxi, not\,taxi\}\to\{colors\,of\,cars\}$ there corresponds a canonical morphism $\{colors\,of\,cars\}\to\{taxi, not\,taxi\}$, called the *Bayesian inverse*.

In some cases, this symmetry gives rise to a [[dagger category]].
