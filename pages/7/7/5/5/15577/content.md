## Idea

The _Ran space_ $Ran X$ of a [[space]], $X$, is the space of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subsets]] of $X$, equipped with geometric structure that knows about points merging to a single point.

The Ran space is defined, in topological and algebro-geometric contexts, for instance in ([Lurie 14, lectures 7-9](#LurieTamagawaNumbers)).

It is named after [[Ziv Ran]].

## Properties

The Ran space of a [[connected space|connected]] [[manifold]] is [[weakly contractible space|weakly contractible]] ([BeilDrin04, p. 173](#BeilDrin04)).
