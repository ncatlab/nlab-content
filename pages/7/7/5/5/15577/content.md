## Idea

The _Ran space_ $Ran X$ of a [[space]], $X$, is the space of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subsets]] of $X$, equipped with geometric structure that knows about several coincident points merging to a single point.

The Ran space is defined, in [[topology|topological]] and [[algebraic geometry|algebro-geometric]] contexts, for instance in ([Lurie 14, lectures 7-9](#LurieTamagawaNumbers)). It is naturally a [[stratified space]] ([Ayala-Francis-Tanaka 14, section 3.7](#AyalaFrancisTanaka14))

For cardinality $i$

$$
Ran_{\leq i} X = \text{colim} ( Fin_{surj,\leq i}^{op} \to Strat \to StTop )
$$

where $Fin_{surj,\leq i}$ has objects that are finite sets of cardinality at most $i$. When $i$ is infinite the subscript is left off as above.

It is named after [[Ziv Ran]].

## Properties

The Ran space of a [[connected space|connected]] [[manifold]] is [[weakly contractible space|weakly contractible]] ([BeilDrin04, p. 173](#BeilDrin04)).


## Examples


$$
  Ran_{\leq 2k+1}(S^1) \;\simeq\; S^{2k+1}
$$
