## Idea

The next higher [[dimension|dimensional]] generalization of the concept of a _[[relativistic particle]]_ and a _[[relativistic string]]_ is called the relativistic _membrane_.

The concept of a [[bosonic modality|bosonic]] membrane was considered already by [Dirac 62](#Dirac62) as a hypothetical [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] for the [[electron]], then abandoned and eventually re-incarnated as the "super-membrane in 11d" due to [Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87](#BergshoeffSezginTownsend87) (whose "m" became the "M" in "[[M-theory]]"), namely the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model for super p-branes]] corresponding to the [[brane scan]]-entry with $p=2$, $D=11$, now commonly known as the _[[M2-brane]]_.

In fact, according to the [[brane scan]], a [[super p-brane|super 2-brane]] [[sigma model]] exists on [[superspacetimes]] of dimension 4, 5, 7, and 11:

* 4: [[super 2-brane in 4d]]

* 5: [[super 2-brane in 5d]]

* 7: ...

* 11: [[M2-brane]]
