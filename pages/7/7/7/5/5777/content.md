## Idea

The _tangent complex_ of an algebro-geometric object is meant to behave as the (sheaf of) sections of the [[tangent bundle]]. 

At least in the generality of  [[derived stack|derived]] [[algebraic stacks]] $X$, the tangent complex is equivalently (up to a shift in degree) the module of sections of the [[infinitesimal disk bundle]] of $X$ (the [[formal completion]] of the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X \colon X \to X \times X$) ([Hennion 13, theorem 1](#Hennion13)).

For $A$ an ordinary [[associative algebra]], its _tangent complex_ is its [[module]] of [[derivations]].

For $A$ a [[dg-algebra]], its _tangent complex_ is the essentially the value of the [[derived functor]] of the derivations-assigning functor on $A$. This is closely related to the [[automorphism ∞-Lie algebra]] of $A$.
