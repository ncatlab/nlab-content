## Idea

Recall that *$A$-algebras*, in the usual sense of [[associative algebras]] over a [[commutative ring]] $A$, are [[rings]] $R$ equipped with ring [[homomorphisms]] $\eta \colon A\to Z(R)$ from $A$ to their [[center]] (and a plain [[unital ring]] $R$ is an [[associative algebra]] over the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$).

By the term *$A$-rings* (e.g. [Böhm (2009), §2.1](#Böhm09)) one refers to the generalization of this notion to the case where $A$ is not necessarily commutative or the [[image]] of $\eta$ is not necessarily in the center of $R$. Hence $A$-rings are general objects in the [[coslice category]] $A/Rings$ (also denoted $A \downarrow Ring$) for arbitrary $A$.

The dual notion is, in some sense, that of *$A$-corings* (e.g. [Böhm (2009), §2.2](#Böhm09)).

## Details

\begin{definition}\label{DefinitionOfARings}
For $A$ a (possibly noncommutative) [[ring]], a _ring over $A$_, or _$A$-ring_ for short, is a [[monoid object]] $R$ [[internalization|internal]] to the [[category]] [[Bimod|$A Bimod$]] (that is: ${}_A Mod_A$), understood as a [[monoidal category]] with respect to the [[tensor product of bimodules]]. 
\end{definition}
(e.g. [Böhm (2009), Def. 2.1](#Böhm09))

Every $A$-ring is a ring in the usual sense, in the sense that there is an obvious [[forgetful functor]] to [[Ring]]. In fact the unit map $A \to R$ is a morphism of rings, and the category of $A$-rings is precisely the [[coslice category]] or [[coslice category]] $A/Ring$. Thus by category-theoretic rules, one might be led to unconventionally call $A$-rings "rings *under* $A$". Unfortunately, standard name for $A$-rings is "rings *over* $A$", like conventionally calling $k$-algebras the "algebras *over* $K$". 

Unlike for the $k$-algebras, the multiplication $R\times R\to R$ which is the morphism of $A$-[[bimodules]], is not (left) $A$-linear in the *second* factor, but only $A^{op}$-linear (that is, $A$-linear on the right). In other words, the axiom for $K$-algebras $k (r s) = r (k s)$ is not true, for $k\in A$, $r,s\in R$, although $k (r s) = (k r) s$ and $(r s) k = r (s k)$ do hold.  

Both for a discussion for under-over and also for this difference between $K$-algebras and $A$-rings see the Caf&#233;\'s [quick algebra quiz](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/12/a_quick_algebra_quiz.html).

## $A\otimes A^{op}$-rings

The structure of an $A\otimes A^{op}$-ring $(R,\mu,\eta)$ is determined by
the structure of $A$ as a ring, together with the two natural homomorphisms
of rings
$s = \eta(-\otimes 1_A):A\to R$ and $t=\eta(1_A\otimes -):A^{op}\to R$ which have commuting images ($s(a)t(a')=t(a')s(a)$, for all $a,a'\in A$). In theory of [[associative bialgebroid]]s these are the dual versions of the source and target maps from the study of [[groupoid]]s.

There is (not always associative) product of $A$-rings, and especially useful in the study of $A\otimes A^{op}$-rings, given by certain [[coend]], so called [[Takeuchi product]].
