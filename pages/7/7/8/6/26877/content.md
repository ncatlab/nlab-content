## Idea

Under *matrix decomposition* one understands the factoring of [[matrices]] as [[matrix product|products of matrices]] of a certain form.

This may and often is also referred to as *[[matrix factorization]]*, which however also has other meanings.

## Examples 

* [[Gauss decomposition]]

* [[polar decomposition]]

* [[QR decomposition]]

* [[LU decomposition]]
