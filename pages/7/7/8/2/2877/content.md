There are many approaches to the generalizations of [[principal bundles]] to various flavours of [[noncommutative geometry]]. Not only that the base and total space of a principal bundle are replaced by noncommutative spaces, but various frameworks of noncommutative geometry also allow that the structure group be replaced by some analogue or generalization, something like [[quantum group]]. Some people hence talk about "quantum principal bundles".

In [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], the most studied is the case in which the base and total space are affine, i.e. each represented by a single algebra, say base by $U$ and the total space by $E$. If the structure group is a [[Hopf algebra]], then the standard requirement is that $E$ is a right $H$-comodule algebra which is a [[Hopf-Galois extension]] of $U$. One generalization of this picture are the "coalgebra bundles"

In that case, the Hopf algebra is replaced by a [[coalgebra]] $C$, the total space by an algebra which is a $C$-comodule, bu then an entwining structure is needed as an additional structure, and again a version of a Galois condition is required. The entwining which is a mixed [[distributive law]] is in fact in a role of lifting certain induced action of a monoidal category associated to $C$ from the base ground scheme cf.

* Z. &#352;koda, _Distributive laws for actions of monoidal categories_, [math.CT/0406310](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0406310).

The liftings can be defined more generally in nonaffine situations leading to the concept of [[geometrically admissible action]]s as in

The Galois condition can then be defined locally on some compatible cover. A generalized version of the Schneider's descent theorem hold in this generality. 

As a particular case, this allows the $H$-comodule algebras which are not Hopf-Galois extension of their coinvariants but became so when localizing on some affine biflat coaction compatible cover by affine biflat localizations (see [[zoranskoda:gluing categories from localizations|here]]). In other words the localized algebras are Hopf-Galois extensions (for example [[crossed product algebra]]s) of the [[localized coinvariant]]s as in 

* Z. &#352;koda, _Localizations for construction of quantum coset spaces_, [math.QA/0301090](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.QA/0301090),  Banach Center Publ. __61__, pp. 265--298, Warszawa 2003;

A principal bundle is called locally trivial if there is a cover on which the Hopf-Galois extensions are in fact [[crossed product algebra|Hopf smash products]]. In the commutative case with affine algebraic group as a structure group, this is the same as the local triviality in [[fpqc topology]]. 

Another point of view to generalized Galois conditions in noncommutative algebraic geometry based on spaces represented by monoidal categories can be found in

As [[Hopf algebroid]]s generalize (function algebras on) groupoids, there is a well motivated study of Galois conditions (hence torsors) in the world of Hopf algebroids:
