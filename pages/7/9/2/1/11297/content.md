## Idea

The _Stolz conjecture_ (also: Stolz-[[Gerald Höhn|Höhn]] conjecture) due to ([Stolz 96](#Stolz96)) asserts that if $X$ is a [[closed manifold]] with [[String structure]] which furthermore admits a [[Riemannian metric]] with [[positive number|positive]] [[Ricci curvature]], then its [[Witten genus]] vanishes.

See ([Dessai](#Dessai)) for a review.

## Motivation

One part of the reasoning that motivates the conjecture is the idea that [[string geometry]] should be a "[[looping and delooping|delooping]]" of [[spin geometry]], and that the [[Witten genus]] is roughly like the [[index of a Dirac operator]] on [[loop space]]. Now for [[spin geometry]] the [[Lichnerowicz formula]] implies that for [[positive number|positive]] [[scalar curvature]] there are no harmonic [[spinors]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$, and hence that the [[index]] of the [[Dirac operator]] vanishes. One might then expect that there is a sensible concept of scalar curvature of [[smooth loop space]] $\mathcal{L} X$ obtained by integrating the [[Ricci curvature]] on $X$ along loops ([[transgression]]). Therefore, in this reasoning, a positive [[Ricci curvature]] of $X$ would imply a positive [[scalar curvature]] of the [[smooth loop space]] $\mathcal{L}X$, thus a vanishing of the [[index]] of the "[[Dirac operator on smooth loop space]]", hence a vanishing of the Witten genus.

## Evidence

### From perturbation theory

The [[Witten genus]] is by construction the [[partition function]] of the [[heterotic string]], in the [[large volume limit]]. One may further approximate this in [[perturbative quantum field theory]]. Working equivalently with the [[2d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] in [[perturbation theory]], one may say something. A decent review is in ([Yagi 10](#Yagi10)).
