## Idea

**Ehrenfeucht-Fra&#239;ss&#233; games** are a technique in [[model theory]] for
studying whether to structures are elementary equivalent. Variations
can be used to study equivalence with respect to logics other than
first-order logic.

The games are played by two players: the _spoiler_, whose objective is
to establish a difference between the two structures, and the
_duplicator_, whose objective is to show that the two structures are
similar.

A game is played in turns for a number of rounds (in general an
ordinal, but usually a finite number or $\omega$). In each round the
spoiler picks an element of one of the structures and then the
duplicator responds by picking an element of the other structure. At
the end of the game they have together selected two sequences of equal
length of elements of the two structures, and the duplicator wins if
the sequences generate isomorphic substructures of the given
structures. (See below for variations in the winning conditions.)

## Definition

We first define the **Ehrenfeucht-Fra&#239;ss&#233; game of length $\gamma$ on
$\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$**,
$EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$. It is a game of perfect
information played as follows. The ordinal $\gamma$ is the length of
the game, and at step $i\lt\gamma$, the spoiler chooses an element of
either $\mathfrak{A}$ or $\mathfrak{B}$; then the duplicator chooses
an element of the other structure. Between them they choose $a_i\in A$
and $b_i\in B$. At the end of the game we have a **play** which is a
pair $(\bar a,\bar b)$ of sequences of length $\gamma$. We count this
play as a **win for the duplicator** if there is an isomorphism $f :
\langle\bar a\rangle_{\mathfrak{A}} \to \langle\bar
b\rangle_{\mathfrak{B}}$ such that $f(a_i)=b_i$ for $i\lt\gamma$. (The
notation $\langle\bar a\rangle_{\mathfrak{A}}$ denotes the
substructure of $\mathfrak{A}$ generated by the sequence $\bar a$.)

An alternative way of phrasing the winning condition is to say that
the play $(\bar a,\bar b)$ is a win for the duplicator if and only if
$(\mathfrak{A},\bar a) \equiv_0 (\mathfrak{B},\bar b)$, i.e., the
expansions of the two structures by the given sequences satisfy the
same atomic (or the same quantifier-free) sentences.

+-- {: .num_example #DefEF}
###### Definition 
We write $\mathfrak{A} \sim_\gamma \mathfrak{B}$ to mean that the
duplicator has a winning strategy in the game
$EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$.
=--

It is easy to see that this is an equivalence relation on structures,
and $\mathfrak{A} \sim_\gamma \mathfrak{B}$ always holds when
$\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are isomorphic.
Note the $EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ is an infinite game if
$\gamma\ge\omega$.

## Back-and-forth systems

For the game $EF_\omega(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$ we have the
following alternative characterization of $\mathfrak{A} \sim_\omega
\mathfrak{B}$.

A **back-and-forth system** from $\mathfrak{A}$ to $\mathfrak{B}$ is
an inhabited set $I$ of pairs $(\bar a,\bar b)$ of equal length
sequences from $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ such that

* for every $(\bar a,\bar b)\in I$ we have $(\mathfrak{A},\bar a)
  \equiv_0 (\mathfrak{B},\bar b)$, and

* for every $(\bar a,\bar b)\in I$ and every $a\in A$, there is a
  $b\in B$ such that $(\bar a a, \bar b b)\in I$, and

* for every $(\bar a,\bar b)\in I$ and every $b\in B$, there is an $a
  \in A$ such that $(\bar a a, \bar b b)\in I$.

+-- {: .num_example #PropBF}
###### Proposition 
There is a back-and-forth system from $\mathfrak{A}$ to $\mathfrak{B}$
if and only if $\mathfrak{A} \sim_\omega \mathfrak{B}$.
=--

For this reason we say that $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are
**back-and-forth equivalent** if and only if $\mathfrak{A} \sim_\omega
\mathfrak{B}$.

+-- {: .num_example #ACFBF}
###### Example 
Any two algebraically closed fields of equal characteristic and
infinite transcendence degree over their respective prime subfields
are back-and-forth equivalent. A back-and-forth system is in this case
given by the pairs of generating sequences for isomorphic finitely generated
subfields.

+-- {: .num_example #ThmCountableBF}
###### Theorem 
Suppose $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are at most countable
back-and-forth equivalent structures. Then $\mathfrak{A}$ and
$\mathfrak{B}$ are isomorphic, and if the play $(\bar a,\bar b)$ is a
win for the duplicator in $EF_\omega(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$, then
there is an isomorphism $f : \mathfrak{A} \to \mathfrak{B}$ with
$f(a_i)=b_i$ for $i\lt\omega$.
=--

+-- {: .num_example #CantorThm}
###### Corollary
**(Cantor's Theorem)**
Any two countable [[DLO|dense linear orders
without endpoints]] are isomorphic.  A back-and-forth system is given
by the pairs of finite sequences of isomorphic finite suborders.

## Unnested Ehrenfeucht-Fra&#239;ss&#233; games

One major application of Ehrenfeucht-Fra&#239;ss&#233; games is to study
elementary equivalence. For languages without (non-constant) function
symbols, however, we need a slight modification to the above
definitions.

The **unnested Ehrenfeucht-Fra&#239;ss&#233; game of length $\gamma$ on
$\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$**,
$EF_\gamma[\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B}]$ is played exactly like
$EF_\gamma(\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B})$, but a play $(\bar a,\bar b)$
counts as a **win for the duplicator** if and only $(\mathfrak{A},\bar
a)$ and $(\mathfrak{B},\bar b)$ satisfy the same **unnested** atomic
formulas.

Recall that an **unnested atomic formula** for a first-order language
of one of the following forms:

* $x = y$ for variables $x$ and $y$,

* $x = c$ for variable $x$ and constant symbol $c$,

* $x = f(\bar y)$ for variables $x$ and $\bar y$ and function symbol $f$,

* $R(\bar x)$ for variables $\bar x$ and relation symbol $R$.

Any atomic formula is equivalent to a $\Delta$-formula built from
unnested atomic formulas (but the quantifier rank grows with the size
of the involved terms).

+-- {: .num_example #DefEF}
###### Definition 
We write $\mathfrak{A} \approx_\gamma \mathfrak{B}$ to mean that the
duplicator has a winning strategy in the game
$EF_\gamma[\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B}]$.
=--

Note that $\mathfrak{A} \sim_\gamma \mathfrak{B}$ implies
$\mathfrak{A} \approx_\gamma \mathfrak{B}$ and the converse holds for
any limit ordinal $\gamma$ or whenever the language has no constant
and function symbols (as in that case every atomic formula is
automatically unnested).

The key reason to introduce the unnested formulas and games is the
following theorem:

+-- {: .num_example #FraisseHintikka}
###### Theorem
**(Fra&#239;ss&#233;-Hintikka theorem)**
Suppose the language $L$ has finitely many symbols. Then we can
effectively find for each $k,n\lt\omega$ a finite set $\Theta_{n,k}$
of unnested formulas in $n$ free variables of quantifier rank at most
$k$, such that

* for every $L$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$, all $k,n\lt\omega$, and all
  $n$-tuples $\bar a$ from $\mathfrak{A}$, there is exactly one
  formula $\theta$ in $\Theta_{n,k}$ with $(\mathfrak{A},\bar a)
  \vDash \theta$,

* for all $k,n\lt\omega$ and all $L$-structures $\mathfrak{A}$ and
  $\mathfrak{B}$ and corresponding $n$-tuples $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ we
  have $(\mathfrak{A},\bar a) \approx_k (\mathfrak{B},\bar b)$ if and
  only if there is $\theta\in\Theta_{n,k}$ satisfied by both
  $(\mathfrak{A},\bar a)$ and $(\mathfrak{B},\bar b)$,

* for all $k,n\lt\omega$ it holds that every unnested formula in $n$
  free variables of quantifier rank at most $k$ is equivalent to a
  disjunction of formulas in $\Theta_{n,k}$.
=--

This appears as Theorem 3.3.2 in [Hodges 93](#Hodges93). 

+-- {: .num_example #FraisseTheorem}
###### Corollary
**(Fra&#239;ss&#233;'s theorem)** Two structures $\mathfrak{A}$ and
$\mathfrak{B}$ in a finite language are elementarily equivalent,
$\mathfrak{A} \equiv \mathfrak{B}$ if and only if for every
$k\lt\omega$, $\mathfrak{A} \approx_k \mathfrak{B}$.
