> **Cohomology and gauge fields.** While [[cohomology]] has of course many and diverse applications, in [[physics]] no less than in other fields, the role of cohomology specifically in the *global* description of ([[higher gauge field|higher]]) [[gauge fields]] ("[[force fields]]") is profound: In generalization of the seminal historical observation ("[[Dirac charge quantization]]") that [[electromagnetic field]] [[field configurations|configurations]] are globally to be identified with 2-[[cocycles]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]], [[higher gauge field]] species are similarly to be identified with [[generalized cohomology]] theories whose further properties and attributes closely reflect the field's physical nature, as indicated in the above table.
