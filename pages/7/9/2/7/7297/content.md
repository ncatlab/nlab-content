## Idea

For a [[local ring]] to be regular is a kind of a smoothness condition for local rings. 

## Definition

A __regular local ring__ $R$ is a Noetherian commutative unital [[local ring]] whose [[Krull dimension]] agrees with the minimal number of generators of its maximal ideal $I$. Equivalently, the Krull dimension equals $dim_k (I/I^2)$ where $k = R/I$ is the residue field of $R$. A Noetherian local ring is regular iff its global dimension is finite; it follows that its global and Krull dimension coincide. 

## Disambiguation

The notion should not be confused with that of a [[von Neumann regular ring]] in noncommutative algebra.

## Relation to other classes

Every regular local ring is a complete intersection ring and a fortiori a [[Cohen-Macaulay ring]].
