## Idea

For a [[local ring]] to be *regular* is a kind of a smoothness condition. 

## Definition

A __regular local ring__ $R$ is a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[unital ring|unital]] [[local ring]] whose [[Krull dimension]] agrees with the minimal number of generators of its [[maximal ideal]] $I$, equivalently whise Krull dimension equals $dim_k (I/I^2)$ where $k = R/I$ is the [[residue field]] of $R$. 

A [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[local ring]] is regular iff its [[global dimension]] is [[finite number|finite]]; it follows that its [[global dimension|global]] and [[Krull dimension]] coincide. 



## Properties

### Relation to other classes

Every regular local ring is a [[complete intersection ring]] and a fortiori a [[Cohen-Macaulay ring]].
