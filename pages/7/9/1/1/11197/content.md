## Idea

The [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra|stable $\infty$-category of spectra]] has a [[dualizing object in a closed category|dualizing object]] (dualizing module) on a suitable subcategory of finite spectra. This is called the _[[Anderson spectrum]]_ $I_{\mathbb{Z}}$ ([[Representability Theorems|Lurie, Example 4.3.9]]). The [[duality]] that this induces is called _Anderson duality_.

## Examples

The Anderson dual of the [[sphere spectrum]] is discussed in 

* [Hopkins & Singer 2005, appendix B](#HopkinsSinger05), in the context of constructing a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]] on [[ordinary differential cohomology]], 

* [Freed 2014, section 5.1.1](#Freed14), in the context of [[invertible field theory|invertible]] [[extended topological field theories]].

The Anderson dual of [[KU]] is (complex conjugation-equivariantly) the 4-fold [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^4 KU$ ([Heard & Stojanoska 2014, theorem 8.2](#HeardStojanoska14)). This implies that, nonequivariantly $KU$ is Anderson self-dual and the Anderson dual of $KO$ is $\Sigma^4KO$, which were both first proven by [Anderson 1969](#Anderson69).

Similarly [[Tmf]]$[1/2]$ is Anderson dual to its 21-fold suspension ([Stojanoska 2012](#Stojanoska12)).
