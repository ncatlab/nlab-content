A [[topological vector space]] is __locally convex__ if it has a base of topology consisting of convex open subsets.  Equivalently, it is a vector space equipped with a [[gauge space|gauge]] consisting of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].  As with other topological vector spaces, a locally convex space (LCS) is often assumed to be [[Hausdorff space]].

Locally convex (topological vector) spaces are the standard setup for much of the contemporary [[functional analysis]]. 


## Functionals 

One reason why locally convex TVS are important is that lots of [[functional]]s exist on them, at least if one assumes an appropriate choice principle, e.g., [[axiom of choice]] or [[ultrafilter theorem]] (or just [[dependent choice]] for a [[separable space]]). This fact is encapsulated in the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]; a nice exposition is given in Terry Tao's [lecture notes](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/245b-notes-6-duality-and-the-hahn-banach-theorem/). By way of contrast, a TVS which is _not_ locally convex, such as the topological vector space $L^p([0, 1])$ where $0 \lt p \lt 1$, need not have any (nonzero) functionals at all.
