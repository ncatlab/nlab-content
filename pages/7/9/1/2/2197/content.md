A [[topological vector space]] is __locally convex__ if it has a base of topology consisting of convex open subsets.  Equivalently, it is a vector space equipped with a [[gauge space|gauge]] consisting of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].  As with other topological vector spaces, a locally convex space (LCS) is often assumed to be [[Hausdorff space]].

Locally convex (topological vector) spaces are the standard setup for much of the contemporary [[functional analysis]].
