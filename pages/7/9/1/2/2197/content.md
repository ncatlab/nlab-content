A [[topological vector]] is a [[vector space]] over real or complex numbers (some generalizations possible) with a topology for which the operations of the vector addition, subtraction and the multiplication by scalars continuous. If it is $T_1$, it is automatically not only Hausdorff, but also Tihonov (= competely regular, $T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$); this is usually assumed. A Hausdorff topological vector space is __locally convex__ if it has a base of topology consisting of convex open subsets. 

Locally convex (topological vector) spaces are the standard setup for much of the contemporary [[functional analysis]].
