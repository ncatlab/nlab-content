One of the basic results of [[Morse theory]] are the so-called Morse inequalities involving Morse numbers. The values in the Morse inequalities depend on a choice of [[Morse function]]. The best possible case if when the Morse inequalities are equalities. In that case we speak of a **perfect Morse function**.

It has long been known that the existence of a perfect Morse function on every smooth 3-dimensional manifold is equivalent to the 3-dimensional [Poincar&#233; conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture), which is now the Poincar&#233;--Perelman theorem.
