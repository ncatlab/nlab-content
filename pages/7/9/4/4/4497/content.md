## Idea

In addition to the usual [[distributive laws]] between a [[monad]] and a monad (in a bicategory) there are many other combinations like between monad and [[comonad]], comonad and endofunctor, action of a monoidal category and a monad and so on. Suppose $V$ is any monoidal category with coequalizers and where the tensor product preserves coequalizers, for example $V$ is the category of $k$-modules where $k$ is a commutative ring. Then for any $k$-algebra $A$, endofunctors $A\otimes -$ and $-\otimes A$ are monads on $V$; similarly if $C$ is a $k$-coalgebra, then endofunctors $C\otimes -$ and $-\otimes C$ are comonads on $V$. A left entwining structure is a morphism
$\phi:A\otimes C\to C\otimes A$ in $V$ satisfying 4 coherences so that $\phi\otimes -$ is (after postcomposing by the associativity coherence) a mixed [[distributive law]] $A\otimes(C\otimes -)\to C\otimes(A\otimes -)$. 
This amounts to 
ensuring the lifting of $C\otimes -$ to a comonad on $A\otimes -$-modules (which are the same as _left_ $A$-modules) or equivalently the lifting of monad $A\otimes -$ to a monad on $C\otimes -$-comodules. Right entwining structure is a morphism $\psi:C\otimes A\to A\otimes C$ such that $-\otimes\psi$ defines similarly a distributive law ensuring liftings of the comonad $-\otimes C$ to $-\otimes A$-modules, that is _right_ $A$-modules. Entwining structures in the monoidal category of endofunctors are the usual distributive laws.

In category of vector spaces (and $k$-modules for $k$ being a commutative ring) (right) entwining structure was introduced by [Brzeziński and Majid 1998](#BrzezinskiMajid1998) in the context of the study of [[noncommutative principal bundles]], not being aware at the time of the mixed distributive laws in category theory ([Van Osdol, 1973](#vanOsdol73)). Namely, they noticed that some examples of noncommutative principal bundles do not have a bialgebra as a structure "group", but a coalgebra together with an entwining.  Entwinings organize into a [[bicategory]]. Every entwining
induces a coring (as observed by Takeuchi; in [Škoda 2008](#Škoda2008) this correspondence is extended to a 2-functor).
To every entwining structure one associates the corresponding category of [[entwined module]]s.
