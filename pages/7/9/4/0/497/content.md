In [[logic]], the principle of **excluded middle** states that every [[truth value]] is either true or false. (This is sometimes called the 'axiom' or 'law' of excluded middle, either to emphasise that it is or is not optional; 'principle' is a relatively neutral term.) One of the many meanings of [[classical logic]] is to emphasise that this principle holds in the logic; in contrast, it fails in [[intuitionistic logic]].

The principle of excluded middle (hereafter, PEM), as a statement about truth values themselves, is accepted by nearly all mathematicians; those who doubt or deny it are a distinct minority, the [[constructivism|constructivists]]. However, when one [[internalization|internalises]] mathematics in categories other than [[Set|the category of sets]], there is no doubt that excluded middle often fails internally. (Those categories in which excluded middle holds are called [[Boolean category|Boolean]]; in general, the adjective 'Boolean' is often used to indicate the applicability of PEM.)

Excluded middle can be seen as a form of the [[axiom of choice]] (a slightly more controversial principle, doubted or denied by a slightly larger minority, and true internally in even fewer categories). As [[countable choice]] means that any surjection to a countable set (which for this purpose is any set isomorphic to the set of natural numbers) has a section, so PEM means that every surjection to a [[finite set|finitely-indexed set]] has a section. Here, a set $A$ is **finitely-indexed** if, for some natural number $n$, there is a surjection $\{0, \ldots, n - 1\} \to A$. Actually, it\'s enough to consider $2$-indexed sets: If $p$ is a truth value, then divide $\{0,1\}$ by the equivalence relation where $0 \equiv 1$ iff $p$ holds; then the quotient set $A$ is finitely-indexed, while this very surjection $2 \to A$ splits iff $p$ is true or false.
