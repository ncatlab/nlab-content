## Idea

What is called the **mysterious duality** is a [[duality]] first described in ([INV01](#INV01)) in the form of a correspondence between toroidal [[KK-compactifications]] of [[M-theory]] and [[del Pezzo surfaces]]. M-theory on $T^k$ corresponds to the [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{P}^2$ [[blow up|blown up]] at $k$ generic points; [[type II string theory|Type IIB]]  corresponds to $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.

The moduli of compactifications of M-theory on rectangular tori are mapped to K&#228;hler moduli of del Pezzo surfaces. The [[U-duality]] group of M-theory corresponds to a group of classical symmetries of the del Pezzo represented by global diffeomorphisms. The $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS brane charges of M-theory correspond to spheres in the del Pezzo, and their tension to the exponentiated volume of the corresponding spheres.

The [[S-duality]] of type IIB in 10 dimensions corresponds to the exchange of the two $\mathbb{P}^1$s in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.
