The word 'period' has many meanings in [[mathematics]], most of them coming from [[physics]]: the period of an oscillation, the period of a [[periodic function]], periods in celestial mechanics. 

However, there is another deep notion of periods in [[number theory]] and a more specific version related to specific situations in [[algebraic geometry]]. We distinguish irrational and rational numbers; [[complex numbers]] divide into algebraic and transcendental. __Periods__ are more general than algebraic numbers: they are those (complex) numbers which can be obtained as integrals of [[algebraic function]]s (all of whose coefficients are also [[algebraic number]]s) over [[semialgebraic set]]s. The periods form a sub[[field]] of complex numbers bigger than the field of algebraic numbers. There are several operations which lead to new periods. In fact, if we view them abstractly, as integrals of some abstract function over an abstract semialgebraic set, then we can take unions of such sets, do partial integration and so on. There is a conjecture that there are no relations among periods except those of a short list of such obvious relations! 

Periods appear in a number of situations in classical algebraic geometry. Specific matrices of periods are defined and important in the theory of algebraic functions, [[Hodge theory]] for algebraic cycles, the study of actions of [[motivic Galois group]]s, etc. They come as generalizations of "periods of Riemann surfaces" from 19th century.
