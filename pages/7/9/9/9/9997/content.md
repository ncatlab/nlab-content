## Idea

In [Lurie 12, def. 2.1.1](#Lurie12) an [[∞-prestack]] $\mathcal{C}^{op} \to $ [[∞Grpd]] is called _cohesive_ if it sends [[(∞,1)-fiber products]] of "essentially surjective" maps (in the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-site]] $\mathcal{C}$) to $(\infty,1)$-fiber products in [[∞Grpd]]. It is called _infinitesimally cohesive_ ([Lurie 12, def. 2.1.1](#Lurie12)) if this property holds at least for fiber products of maps with "[[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] kernel".

## Related concepts

This is _un-related_ to the notion of _[[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]_.
