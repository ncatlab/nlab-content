As detailed in the entry [[algebraic homotopy]], in his ICM talk of 1950, [[Henry Whitehead]] said:

>The ultimate aim of [[algebraic homotopy]] is to construct a purely
  algebraic theory, which is equivalent to homotopy theory in the same sort of 
  way that 'analytic' is equivalent to 'pure' projective geometry.

then later 
> A statement of the aims of 'algebraic homotopy' might thus include the
following homotopy classification problem (from the same source,
J.H.C.Whitehead, ICM 1950).

>Classify the homotopy types of polyhedra, $X$, $Y$, ... , by
  algebraic data.

>Compute the set of homotopy classes of maps, $[X,Y]$, in terms of the
classifying data for $X$, $Y$.

He had already started on this program in two (famous) papers [[Combinatorial homotopy I]] and [[Combinatorial homotopy II]].  The term _combinatorial homotopy_ was, it seems, in part inspired by the similar usage in _combinatorial_ group theory.
