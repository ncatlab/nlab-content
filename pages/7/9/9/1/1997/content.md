Grothendieck developed in EGA a number of notions of smoothness for a scheme and, more generally, for a morphism of schemes. For algebraic varieties over a field, one already had a classical notion of a nonsingular variety. 

A [[scheme]] of finite type over a field $k$ is __smooth__ if after extension of scalars from $k$ to the algebraic closure $\bar{k}$ it becomes a __regular scheme__, i.e. the stalks of its structure sheaf are regular local rings in the sense of commutative algebra. 

A relative version of a smooth scheme is the notion of [[smooth morphism of schemes]].
