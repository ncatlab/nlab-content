A __cogenerator__ in a category $C$ is an object $S$ such that the functor $h_S = C(-,S) : C^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathrm{Set}$ is faithful. This means that for any pair $g_1,g_2\in C(X,Y)$
there is a morphism $\theta\in C(X,S)$ which distinguishes
them in the sense that $\theta\circ g_1= \theta\circ g_2$.

One often extends this notion to a _generating family_ of objects, which is a small set $\lbrace S_a, a\in A\rbrace$ of objects in $C$ such that the family $C(-,S_a)$ is jointly faithful, that is for any pair $g_1,g_2\in C(X,Y)$
there is an $a\in A$ and a morphism $\theta\in C(X,S_a)$ which distinguishes them in the sense that 
$\theta\circ g_1= \theta\circ g_2$. 

The dual notion is [[generator]].
