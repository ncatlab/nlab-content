## Idea

For **inner derivation Lie 2-algebra** $inn(\mathfrak{g})$ of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is the ([[strict Lie 2-algebra|strict]]) [[Lie 2-algebra]] equivalently given as

* the [[dg-Lie algebra]] of contractions $\iota_x$ and inner derivations $\mathcal{L}_x = [d_{CE},x]$ acting on the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$;

* the [[differential crossed module]] $(\mathfrak{g} \stackrek{Id}{\to} \mathfrak{g})$ with the action being the [[adjoint action]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ on itself;

* the dual of the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$.

See <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Weil+algebra#AsInnerDer">Weil algebra as CE-algebra of inner derivations</a> for more details.

## Properties

The first formulation makes manifest that $inn(\mathfrak{g})$ is the structure that has historically been called [[Cartan calculus]].

## References

The structure of $inn(\mathfrak{g})$ is of course in itself very simple and goes as such back at least to Cartan. 

Its role as a [[Lie 2-algebra]] in the context of [[âˆž-Chern-Weil theory]] has been discussed in section 6 of
