## Idea

In [[solid state physics]], *edge modes* are excitations (of [[electrons]] or [[quasi-particles]]) seen at the [[boundary]] or at a [[corner]] of a  [[crystal|crystalline materials]], where the [[dynamics]] may be different from that in the crystal's [[bulk]].

A notable example are edge modes of [[topological insulators]]: As their name suggests, these [[topological phases of matter]] are in fact [[insulator|insulating]] in their [[bulk]], but on their [[boundary]] they behave like [[conductors]]/[[metals]], due to "edge modes" which may carry [[electric current]].
