A _braided monoidal 2-category_ is a [[2-category]] $C$ equipped with a [[tensor product]] $\otimes : C \times C \to C$ [[2-functor]] which satisfies the first in a hierarchy of conditions for being commutative up to equivalence: in the language of [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]] a braided monoidal 2-category is a **doubly monoidal 2-category*.

As described there, this may be identified with a [[tetracategory]] with a single [[object]] and a single [[k-morphism|1-morphism]].

[[Ben Webster]]: I would very much like to know: what structure on a ([[triangulated category|triangulated]]/[[differential graded category|dg-]]/[[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable infinity]]/whatever you like) [[monoidal category]] would make its 2-category of [[module category|module categories]] (give that phrase any sensible construal you like) is braided monoidal.

If one [[decategorification|decategorifies]] this question, one gets the question "what structure on a [[ring]] makes its category of representations [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal]]" and the answer to this question is well-known: a [[quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra|quasi-triangular]] [[quasi-Hopf algebra|quasi-Hopf]] structure.

I asked a [MathOverflow question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/4790/what-structure-on-a-monoidal-category-would-make-its-2-category-of-module-catego) on the same topic.  No interesting answers yet.
