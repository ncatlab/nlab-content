[[Ben Webster]]: I would very much like to know: what structure on a ([[triangulated category|triangulated]]/[[differential graded category|dg-]]/[[stable infinity category|stable infinity]]/whatever you like) [[monoidal category]] would make its 2-category of [[module category|module categories]] (give that phrase any sensible construal you like) is braided monoidal.

If one [[decategorification|decategorifies]] this question, one gets the question "what structure on a [[ring]] makes its category of representations [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal]]" and the answer to this question is well-known: a [[quasi-triangular]] [[quasi-Hopf algebra|quasi-Hopf]] structure.
