## Idea

In [[solid state physics]] a *conductor* is a [[crystal|crystalline]] material for which the [[chemical potential]] of the [[electrons]] lies *inside* an [[energy band]], then called the *[[conduction band]]*. (If it lies instead in an [[energy gap]] between bands one speaks of an *[[insulator]]* or of a  *[[semi-conductor]]* if the gap is small.)

This situation implies that any quantum of energy is sufficient for exciting the electron [[quantum states]], and hence that they easily carry [[electric charge]] in response to an [[electric potential]] (cf. [[Ohm's law]]).
