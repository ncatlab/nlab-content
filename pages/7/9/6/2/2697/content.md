An [[(∞,1)-topos]] is **hypercomplete** if the [[Whitehead theorem]] is valid in it.

Hypercomplete [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es are precisely those that are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by a local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

Every [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] has a [[hypercompletion]].
