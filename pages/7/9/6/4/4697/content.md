The _kilogram_ (kilogramme, $kg$) is a [[unit]] of [[mass]].  It is $1000$ grams (gramme, $g$).

One kilogram may soon be defined to be the mass of $N$ [[atom]]s of the [[carbon]] [[isotope]] $\mathrm{C}^{12}$, where $N$ is $\frac{1000}{12}$ times the [[Avogadro number]].  Currently, however, this fact is actually the definition of the Avogadro number; instead, the kilogram is defined as the mass of a certain physical object kept by the BIPM in Paris.
