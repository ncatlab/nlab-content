## Idea

Given an [[abelian group scheme]] $A$, its _dual_ $A^\vee$ is essentially the [[moduli space]] of [[line bundles]] over $A$. Accordingly, there is a canonical line bundle over the [[product]] $A \times A^\vee$ (which over each point $(a,P)$ is the fiber over $a$ of the line bundle $P$), the _[[Poincar√© line bundle]]_.
