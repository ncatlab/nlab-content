#Ordinary concept#

Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras are differential graded commutative algebras which are used to define cohomology of Lie algebras. 

#Generalization in $\infty$-context#

In the context of general [[Lie theory]] one notices that Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras generalized to arbitrary "quasi-free differential graded commutative algebras "are usefully thought of as providing a language that naturally allows to pass from Lie algebras to [[L-infinity-algebroid]]s: Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras are taken in this context to be the algebras of functions on [[NQ-supermanifold]]s.

Closely related are [[Weil algebra]]s, which are the algebras of functions on the shifted tangent bundles of these [[NQ-supermanifold]]s.

#Appearance in physics#

In the physics literature Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras of [[L-infinity-algebroid]]s are addressed as [[BRST complex]]es.

In this context

* the generators in degree 0 are called **fields**;

* the generators in degree $1$ are called **ghosts**;

* the generators in degree $2$ are called **ghosts of ghosts**;

* etc.
