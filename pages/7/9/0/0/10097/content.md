## Idea

A conjecture in [[chromatic homotopy theory]] about the nature of the [[algebraic K-theory]] spectrum $K(R)$ of an [[E-infinity ring]] $R$. Roughly, the conjecture says that $K(R)$ has [[chromatic level]] one higher than $R$.

The conjecture as such is stated in

Previous work motivating it was the study of the [[algebraic K-theory]] $K(KU)$ of the [[complex K-theory spectrum]] $KU$ (also thought of as the [[classifying space]] for [[BDR 2-vector bundles]]) in 

* [[Nils Baas]], [[Bj√∏rn Dundas]], [[Birgit Richter]], [[John Rognes]], _Ring completion of rig categories_ ([arXiv:0706.0531](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0531))

which was motivated by the desire to turn [[topological K-theory]] into "a form of" [[elliptic cohomology]] by a kind of [[categorification]].
