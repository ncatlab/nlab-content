Many mathematics titles (not to mention the names for notions) like to involve a game of double meanings, repetition, wit connotations, seeming absurdity, self-referencing, self-mockery and alike. I propose creating list of some known examples of such titles in areas of our interest. Maybe I should have titled this page *Title of titles* to keep the spirit on.

* Pavol &#352;evera, _Some title containing the words "homotopy" and "symplectic", e.g. this one_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.SG/0105080))

* A. Grothendieck, _Hodge's general conjecture is false for trivial reasons_, Topology 8: 299&#8211;-303 (1969). 

* Arne Str&#248;m, _The homotopy category is a homotopy category_, Arch. Math. (Basel) 23 (1972), 435--441.

* V. A. Hinich, V. V. Schechtman, _On homotopy limit of homotopy algebras_, $K$-theory, arithmetic and geometry (Moscow, 1984--1986), 240--264, Lecture Notes in Math., 1289, Springer, Berlin, 1987.
