Many mathematics titles (not to mention the names for notions) like to involve a game of double meanings, repetition, wit, connotations, seeming absurdity, self-referencing, self-mockery and the like. I propose creating list of some known examples of such titles in areas of our interest. Maybe I should have titled this page *Title of titles* to keep the spirit on.

In that vein, I just introduced the term 'punny', although it is a clich&#233;.

Several more candidates of similar character are listed in the responses to MO question [most-memorable-titles](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/44326/most-memorable-titles).
