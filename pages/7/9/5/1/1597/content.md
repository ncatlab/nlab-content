A [[subcategory]] is **strictly full** if it is [[full subcategory|full]] and closed under isomorphism (i.e. [[replete subcategory|replete]]).

Note that, as a condition on subcategories, being strictly full is [[evil]]; however, seeing the full subcategory as a condition objects, that condition is non-evil precisely when the full subcategory is strictly full!
