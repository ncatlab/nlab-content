## Idea

An ordered integral domain is an [[integral domain]] equipped with a compatible [[linear order]].

Note that while the adjective 'ordered' usually refers to a [[total order]], it is traditionally used more strictly when placed before 'integral domain'.

## Definition

An __ordered integral domain__ is an [[integral domain]] $R$ equipped with a [[linear order]] $\lt$ such that:

*  $1 \gt 0$,
*  If $a, b \gt 0$, then so are $a + b$ and $a b$.

## Examples

The integral domain $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]], the integral domain $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]], and the integral domain $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers are all ordered integral domains. 

## Properties

Every ordered integral domain must have [[characteristic]] $0$, since we can prove by [[induction]] that $n \gt 0$ for every positive [[natural number]] $n$.

The [[archimedean integral domain|archimedean]] ordered integral domain are precisely the [[subobject|integral subdomains]] of [[real number|the integral domain of real numbers]].

Every [[localization of a commutative ring|localization]] of the integral domain of integers away from a subset not containing zero is a [[dense linear order]], and the [[Dedekind completion]] of the resulting integral domain is the integral domain of real numbers. In particular, the Dedekind completions of the [[dyadic rational numbers]] and the [[decimal rational numbers]] are both the real numbers.
