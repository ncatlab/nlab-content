## Definition

In [[dependent type theory]] with [[judgmental equality]], a **congruence rule** is an [[inference rule]] which states that [[judgmental equality]] is respected. 

For example, there is a congruence rule for element conversion, which states that given judgmentally equal types $A$ and $B$ and judgmentally equal elements $a$ and $b$ of $A$, $a$ and $b$ are judgmentally equal elements of $B$:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \equiv B \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash a \equiv b:A}{\Gamma \vdash a \equiv b:B}$$
