## Idea

### In sets

The __complement__ $X \setminus S$ of a [[subset]] $S \subset X$ of a [[set]] $X$ is the set of all [[elements]] of $X$ not contained in $S$: 


$$
  X \setminus S 
  \;\coloneqq\; 
  \big\{ 
    x \in X \;|\; 
    x \notin S  
  \big\}
  \,.
$$


(Besides $X \setminus S$, there are many other notations, such as $X - S$, $\bar{S}$, $S^c$, $\neg{S}$, and so forth.)

Notice that $S \cap (X \setminus S) = \empty$, while $S \cup (X \setminus S) = X$ by the principle of [[excluded middle]].  

### In lattices

A __complement__ of an element $S$ of a [[lattice]] is an element $T$ such that $S \wedge T = \bot$ and $S \vee T = \top$. Note that in general, complements need not be unique; for example, in the lattice of vector subspaces of a 2-dimensional [[vector space]] over a [[field]] $k$, a 1-dimensional subspace will have as many complements as there are elements of $k$. However, in some cases complements will be unique, for example in a [[distributive lattice]], in which case it is denoted $\tilde{S}$ (or $\neg S$, etc.). 

If every element has a complement, one speaks of a [[complemented lattice]]. Examples are [[Boolean algebras]], and in fact complemented distributive lattices are the same thing as Boolean algebras (in the sense that the [[category]] of Boolean algebras is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to the category of complemented distributive lattices). 

More generally, the __pseudocomplement__ of an element $S$ of a [[Heyting algebra]] is given by $\tilde{S} := (S \Rightarrow \bot)$.  This satisfies $S \wedge \tilde{S} = \bot$ but not $S \vee \tilde{S} = \top$ in general.  This case includes the complement of a subset even in [[constructive mathematics]].

### In any category

In another direction, the __complement__ of a [[complemented subobject]] $S$ of an [[object]] $X$ in a [[coherent category]] is the unique subobject $\tilde{S}$ such that $S \cap \tilde{S}$ is the [[initial object]] and $S \cup \tilde{S} = X$.

### In truth values

The complement of a [[truth value]] (seen as a subset of the [[point]]) is called its _[[negation]]_.

###Â Strict complements

In [[constructive mathematics]], the denial inequality is not a [[tight apartness relation]], and [[sets]] in general do not have a [[tight apartness relation]]. This means that every [[set]] with a [[tight apartness relation]] has two notions of inequality, the normal [[denial inequality]] $\neq$ and the [[tight apartness relation]] $\#$. Thus, there are two notions of complement. There is the usual notion of complement, where given a set $X$, every element in the complement of a subset $S \subseteq X$ is not equal to any element in $S$. Then there are **strict complements**, where given a set $X$ with a tight inequality relation $\#$, every element in the strict complement of a subset $S \subseteq X$ is apart from every element in $S$.
