###### Theorem
**(Paley-Wiener for $C^{\infty}_0$)**


The vector space of smooth compactly supported functions is (algebraically and topologically) [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], via the [[Fourier transform]], to the space of entire functions $F$ which satisfy the following estimate: there is a positive constant $B$ such that for every [[integer]] $n \gt 0$ there is a constant $C_n$ such that:
$$ 
      F(z) \le C_n (1 + |z|)^{-n} \exp{ (B \; |\operatorname{Im}(z)|)}
$$
