This page is intended to list references to [[category theory]] papers cited as "to appear", "in preparation", or "forthcoming" by the authors, but never appeared (at least with the cited title). The intention is to prevent lost time searching for papers that do not exist. Sometimes a corresponding paper was published, but under a different name, in which case we record the name it was eventually published under.

This article is complementary to the [[list of lost manuscripts in category theory]], which records papers that appear to have been circulated, but not widely, or for which there is evidence they were complete but not circulated.

Do not include recent references that are likely still to appear. If the author is no longer alive, or the reference is not recent (e.g. 20 years or further), it is reasonable to include in this list.
