The **identity morphism**, or simply **identity**, of an [[object]] $x$ in some [[category]] $C$ is the morphism $1_x: x \to x$, or $\id_x: x \to x$, which acts as a two-sided identity for [[composition]].

Given a [[small category]] $C$ with set of objects $C_0$ and set of morphisms $C_1$, the **identity assigning function** of $C$ is the function $i: C_0 \to C_1$ that maps each object in $C_0$ to its identity morphism in $C_1$.

For the generalisation to an [[internal category]] $C$, see [[identity-assigning morphism]].

In [[Set]], the identity morphisms are the [[identity function]]s.
