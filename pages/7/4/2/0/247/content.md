I am a postdoc at the [University of California, San Diego](http://www.math.ucsd.edu).  Here is my [web page](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~shulman/). ( _Is this meant to be your UChicago page still? -David R._ )  I am interested in (higher) category theory and its applications to the rest of mathematics, particularly homotopy theory.  I also tend to be a partisan of higher-categorical structures other than $n$-categories (such as [[double categories]], [[multicategories]], [[proarrow equipments]], and so on), which sometimes seem to get neglected.

I often seem to have strong feelings about terminology.  But I have been known to admit to being wrong, so feel free to argue with me.

For my own reference: some pages that I'm planning to do some work on:
* [[theory]]
* [[lax 2-adjunction]]
* [[structured (infinity,1)-topos]] and [[classifying topos]]
* [[generalized multicategory]], [[virtual double category]], [[virtual equipment]]
* functoriality of [[codiscrete cofibrations]],
* create a separate page [[two-sided fibration]], also work on [[fibration in a 2-category]]
* give a definition at [[2-limit]]
* give an example at [[monadicity theorem]].
* [[image]]
* copy some stuff over from my personal web

And here's how to make a barred arrow $A &#8696; B$, since I always forget:
