Given a [[ring]] $R$, the __socle__ $Soc(M)$ of a left $R$-[[module]] $M$ is the (internal) sum of all [[simple object|simple]] [[subobject|submodules]] of $M$. The correspondence $M\to Soc(M)$ is clearly a subfunctor of the identity functor ${}_R Mod\to {}_R Mod$. It is moreover left exact (but not a [[kernel functor]] in the sense of Goldman). 

By the definition, the socle is a [[semisimple module|semisimple]] $R$-module. If we assume the axiom of choice, then the socle of $M$ can be presented as a direct sum of some subfamily of all simple submodules of $M$.

The notion of socle is important in [[representation theory]]. 

Notice that the notion is dual to the notion of the radical $Rad(M)$ which is the intersection of all maximal submodules of $M$.
