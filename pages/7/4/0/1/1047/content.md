## Idea

Following the terminology of *[[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-categories]]*, an __$(\infty,0)$-category__ is an [[∞-category]] in which every $j$-morphism (for $j \gt 0$) is an [[equivalence]].  

So in an $(\infty,0)$-category _every_ morphism is an [[equivalence]]. Such [[∞-categories]] are usually called _[[∞-groupoid]]s_.

This is directly analogous to how a [[0-category]] is equivalent to a [[set]], a [[(1,0)-category]] is equivalent to a [[groupoid]], and so on.  (In general, an [[(n,0)-category]] is equivalent to an [[n-groupoid]].)

The term "$(\infty,0)$-category" is rarely used, but does for instance serve the purpose of amplifying the generalization from [[Kan complex]]es, which are one model for [[∞-groupoid]]s, to [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]], which are a model for [[(∞,1)-categories]].
