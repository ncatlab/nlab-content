# General Discussion #

Here we should brainstorm ideas about how to use the $n$Lab and how it should work. It's not the $n$_Wiki_, it's the $n$_Lab_, and we need to work out what that means.

-----------------------

#### Embedding questions about unclear text via abbreviation tags?

Take a look at what I did at [[integration over supermanifolds]]. I'm using the hovertext feature to embed a question over the phrase "since odd graded differential 1-forms, being of total even degree, do not have a top exterior power"... if your mouse lingers over this. Maybe this is an idea?

#### Slash lab entries?

I have the vague idea that mathematical entries (like [[integration over supermanifolds]] should have a "/lab" section where "lab" things get done, like a tutorial class. I don't know what that means.
