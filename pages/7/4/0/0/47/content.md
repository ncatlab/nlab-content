# General Discussion #

Here we should brainstorm ideas about how to use the $n$Lab and how it should work. It's not the $n$_Wiki_, it's the $n$_Lab_, and we need to work out what that means.

-----------------------

#### Embedding questions about unclear text via abbreviation tags?

Bruce Bartlett says: Take a look at what I did at [[integration over supermanifolds]]. I'm using the hovertext feature to embed a question over the phrase "since odd graded differential 1-forms, being of total even degree, do not have a top exterior power"... if your mouse lingers over this. Maybe this is an idea?

Urs Schreiber says: That's a great idea! I have replied to your question in that entry now (check it out!) which means that the mouse-over effect is currently no longer visible (it still is present in the source code there, so everybody can check how this works: where did you leanr about this feature??), but let's consider sticking to that kind of inserting questions.


#### Slash lab entries?

_Bruce Bartlett says:_ I have the vague idea that mathematical entries (like [[integration over supermanifolds]] should have a "/lab" section where "lab" things get done, like a tutorial class. I don't know what that means.

_Urs Schreiber say:_ I don't know either! We are likely to have entries of very different nature, some of them just reviewing very standard stuff, some summarizing less well-known stuff, and in some areas we may want to think about new stuff, even. I think as long as every single page makes clear where the information presented there comes from, everything is okay.


#### Single-Author Areas ####

Instiki can run multiple Wikis ("Webs" in the Instiki Parlance). Urs, John and David have the password required to create additional Webs.

* Webs can be password-protected, so that only those in posession of the password can edit them.
* A password-protected Web can be "published" so that others can read, but not edit, the contents. (Or, of course, they can remain unpublished, so that the authors can carry out their *super sekrit* machinations in private).

These two features provide the possibility for single-author areas, where one person (or persons: whoever has the requisite password) is in authorial control.

Here is [[baez:HomePage|John's area]].
