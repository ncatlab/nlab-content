Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring. Then for any nonzero finitely generated $R$-module $M$ of finite projective dimension $pd_R(M)$ the following formula holds
$$
pd_R(M) + depth(M) = depth(R)
$$

As a corollary a commutative ring is regular iff it has a finite global dimension. This is also proved by Serre. 

This in turn is the essence of the fact that for any [[regular scheme]], hence in particular for any [[smooth scheme]] over a field, the bounded [[derived category of coherent sheaves]] coincides with the [[full triangulated subcategory]] of [[perfect complex]]es. In other words, the [[triangulated category of singularities]] of a smooth scheme is trivial. 

One should be warned that another result on regular rings is usually known as [[Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem]] (from a later article in 1959), namely that every regular local ring is a [[unique factorization domain]].
