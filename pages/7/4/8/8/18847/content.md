


In [[BV-BRST formalism]] the plain [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}$ of a given [[Lagrangian field theory]] is accompanied by an auxiliary Lagrangian density $\mathbf{L}_{BRST}$ depending on [[auxiliary fields]] such as [[ghost fields]] and [[antifields]], such that the [[local antibracket]] with the sum $-\mathbf{L} + \mathbf{L}_{BRST}$ yields the [[BV-BRST differential]]

$$
  s
  \;=\;
  \left\{
     - \mathbf{L}
     + \mathbf{L}_{BRST}
     \,,\,
     -
  \right\}
$$

which models the [[derived critical locus]] $\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L} \simeq 0$ inside the [[homotopy quotient]] modeled by the [[BRST complex]] of the  theory.
