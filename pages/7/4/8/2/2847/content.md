## Idea

A **large cardinal** is a [[cardinal number]] that is larger than can be proven to exist in the ambient [[set theory]], usually [[ZF]] or ZFC.  Large cardinals arrange themselves naturally into a more or less linear order of size and consistency strength, and provide a convenient yardstick to measure the consistency strength of various other assertions that are unprovable from ZFC.

## List of large cardinal axioms

* [[axiom of infinity]] -- a large cardinal axiom relative to finitist theories, but not relative to ZF
* [[inaccessible cardinal]] -- the smallest sort of large cardinal in ZF, equivalent to the existence of a [[Grothendieck universe]].
* [[measurable cardinal]] -- the boundary between "small" large cardinals and "large" large cardinals
* [[elementary embedding]] -- a tool used in the study of large large cardinals
* [[supercompact cardinal]]
* [[Vopěnka's principle]] -- a large cardinal axiom with important implications for the behavior of [[locally presentable categories]] and [[accessible categories]].



* Wikipedia has a [list of large cardinal properties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_cardinal_properties).
