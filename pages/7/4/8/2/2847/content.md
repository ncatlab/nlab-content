## Idea

A **large cardinal** is a [[cardinal number]] that is larger than can be proven to exist in the ambient [[set theory]], usually [[ZF]] or ZFC.  Large cardinals arrange themselves naturally into a more or less linear order of size and consistency strength, and provide a convenient yardstick to measure the consistency strength of various other assertions that are unprovable from ZFC.

Set theorists often adopt the existence of certain large cardinals as [[axioms]] in the [[foundation of mathematics]].


## List of large cardinal conditions

* [[axiom of infinity]] -- a large cardinal axiom relative to finitist theories, but not relative to ZF
* [[inaccessible cardinal]] -- the smallest sort of large cardinal in ZF, equivalent to the existence of a [[Grothendieck universe]].
* [[axiom of replacement]], an axiom schemata that states that certain [[families]] of sets or [[diagrams]] in the [[category of sets]], which usually can be proven (for example, in [[Zermelo set theory]] or in a [[well-pointed topos]]) to be [[large sets|large]] or [[proper classes]], are instead [[small set|small]]. This implies that certain cardinals which previously were large are now small. 
* [[measurable cardinal]] -- the boundary between "small" large cardinals and "large" large cardinals
* [[real-valued-measurable cardinal]], a “solution” to the Banach–Ulam problem.
* [[strongly compact cardinal]], whose existence controls properties images of [[accessible functors]]
* [[elementary embedding]] -- a tool used in the study of large large cardinals
* [[supercompact cardinal]]
* [[extendible cardinal]]
* [[C(n)-extendible cardinal]]
* [[Vopěnka's principle]] -- a large cardinal axiom with important implications for the behavior of [[locally presentable categories]] and [[accessible categories]].
