# Definition #

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **paracompact** if every open [[cover]]ing $U$ has a [[refinement]] by an open covering $V$ that is _locally finite_, i.e. such that every point has a neighbourhood that intersects only finitely many open subsets in $V$ .

Often one requires a paracompact space to be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] as well; the issues here are the same as those for [[compact space]]s.


For paracompact spaces, [[numerable open cover|numerable open covers]] are cofinal in all open covers.


# Examples #

* every [[compact space]] is paracompact;
* every [[separable space|separable]] [[metric space]] is paracompact;
* every metric space whatsoever is paracompact, assuming the [[axiom of choice]];
* pseudometric spaces are paracompact under the same conditions, if one does not require Hausdorffness;
* any second-countable [[locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space is paracompact;
* the [[Sorgenfrey line]] is a good example of a paracompact space that doesn\'t fit into other general classes of paracompact spaces;
* the [[long line]] is *not* paracompact, even though it is a [[manifold]] (unless one specifically requires paracompactness of manifolds).
