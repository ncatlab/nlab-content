#Idea#

In a [[quasi-category]] the notion of [[terminal object]] in an ordinary [[category]] is relaxed in the suitable [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] sense: instead of demanding that form any other object there is a _unique_ morphism into the terminal object, in a quasi-category there is a _contractible space_ of such morphisms, i.e. the morphism to the terminal object is unique up to homotopy.


#Definition#

Let $C$ be a [[quasi-category]] and $c \in C$ one of its [[object]]s (a vertex in the corresponding [[simplicial set]]). The object $c$ is a **terminal object** in $C$ if the following equivalent conditions hold:

* The projection from the [[over quasi-category|over category]] $C_{/c} \to C$ is a [[model structure on simplicial sets|trivial fibration of simplicial sets]].

* For every object $d$ of $C$ the right hom Kan-complex into $d$ is contractible:
$$
  Hom_C^R(d,c) \simeq pt
  \,.
$$
