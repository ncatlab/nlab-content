# Terminal objects in quasi-categories
* tic
{: toc}


## Idea

In a [[quasi-category]] the notion of [[terminal object]] known from ordinary [[category theory]] is relaxed in the [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] sense to the suitable notion in [[(∞,1)-category theory]]:

instead of demanding that from any other object there is a _unique_ morphism into the terminal object, in a quasi-category there is a _[[contractible space]]_ of such morphisms, i.e. the morphism to the terminal object is unique _up to [[homotopy]]_.


##Definition

Let $C$ be a [[quasi-category]] and $c \in C$ one of its [[object]]s (a vertex in the corresponding [[simplicial set]]). The object $c$ is a **terminal object** in $C$ if the following equivalent conditions hold:

* The projection from the [[over quasi-category]] $C_{/c} \to C$ is a [[model structure on simplicial sets|trivial fibration of simplicial sets]].

* For every object $d$ of $C$ the right hom Kan-complex into $d$ is contractible:

$$
  Hom_C^R(d,c) \simeq {*}
  \,.
$$
