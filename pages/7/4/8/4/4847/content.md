> this entry is about the _signature_ of a [[permutation]]. For other notions of [[signature]] see there.
 
## Definition


For $Aut(\{1, \cdots , n\}) \simeq S_n$ the [[symmetric group]] on $n \in \mathbb{N}$ elements, the _signature_ is the unique [[group]] [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma : S_n \to \mathbb{Z}_2
$$

that sends the operations $s_{i i+1} : \{1, \cdots, n\} \to \{1, \cdots, n\}$ which interchanges the $i$th element with its neighbour to the nontrivial element $(-1) \in \mathbb{Z}_2$.
