A [[category]] $C$ is **well-powered** if for every object $X$, the (possibly large) [[preorder]] of [[monomorphism|monomorphisms]] with codomain $X$ is equivalent to a _small_ [[poset]].  Variations exist that use notions of [[subobject]] other than monomorphisms.

If $C^{op}$ is well-powered, we say that $C$ is **well-copowered** (although "cowell-powered" is also common).

## Relation to local smallness ##

A well-powered category with finite [[product|products]] is always [[locally small category|locally small]], since morphisms $f:A\to B$ can be identified with particular subobjects of $A\times B$ (their graphs).

Conversely, any locally small category with a [[subobject classifier]] must obviously be well-powered.  In particular, a [[topos]] is locally small if and only if it is well-powered.
