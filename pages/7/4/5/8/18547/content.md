## Idea

A [[K채hler structure]] on a [[symplectic manifold]] induces a [[polarization]], and [[geometric quantization]] with respect to such [[K채hler polarizations]] works particularly well and has numerous examples (e.g. the [[orbit method]] and [[quantization of Chern-Simons theory]]). 

An _[[almost K채hler structure]]_ does not induce a [[polarization]] in the usual sense, unless it is actually a K&#228;hler structure. Nevertheless, via [[geometric quantization by push-forward]] there is still a concept of [[geometric quantization]] of almost K&#228;hler structures (in the case of finite-dimensional manifolds), which is "as good" as K&#228;hler quantization ([Borthwick-Uribe 96](#BorthwickUribe96)).

Examples of almost-K&#228;hler structures on [[phase spaces]] include the phase space of the [[scalar field]] with reasonable [[interaction]] terms, such as the [[free field]] or the [[phi^4 theory|phi^4 interaction]] ([Collini 16, section 3.2.2](#Collini16)).

## Related concepts

* [[pseudo-holomorphic vector bundle]]

* [[Fedosov deformation quantization]] naturally applies to almost-K&#228;hler structures, too
