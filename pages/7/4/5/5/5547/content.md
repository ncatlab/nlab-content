## Definition

A [[large site]] is an **essentially small site** if it has a [[small category|small]] [[dense sub-site]].

## Examples

* The category of [[paracompact manifold]]s with its standard [[open cover]] [[coverage]] is a [[large site]] that is essentially small: a dense sub-site is [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$.

* The category [[Diff]] of smooth manifolds with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]] is a [[large site]] that is essentially small: a dense sub-site is [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$.
