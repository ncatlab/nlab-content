## Definition

A [[vector space]] is _finite-dimensional_ if it admits a [[finite set|finite]] [[basis]]: if there exists a [[natural number]] $n$ such that the vector space admits a [[linear isomorphism]] to the [[direct sum]] of $n$ copies of the [[underlying]] vector space of the [[ground field]]. 

The category [[FinDimVect]] of finite-dimensional vector spaces is of course the [[full subcategory]] of [[Vect]] whose objects are finite-dimensional.

###### Proposition

A vector space $V$ is finite-dimensional precisely if the [[hom-functor]] $\hom(V, -) \colon Vect \to Set$ [[preserved colimit|preserves]] [[filtered colimits]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that every vector space $W$ is the  [[filtered colimit]] of the [[diagram]] of finite-dimensional subspaces $W' \subseteq W$ and inclusions between them. Applying this to $W = V$, the condition that $\hom(V,-)$ preserves filtered colimits implies that the canonical comparison map from the following [[filtered colimit]] over the finite-dimensional subspaces is an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  \underset{
    \underset
     {\mathclap{fd\, V' \subseteq V}}
     {\longrightarrow}
  }{\lim}
  \;
  \hom(V, V') 
    \overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}
  \hom(V, V)
  \mathrlap{\,.}
$$ 

Therfore some element $[f]$ in the colimit represented by $f \colon V \to V'$ gets mapped to the [[identity morphism|identity]] $id_V$, i.e., $i \circ f = id_V$ for some inclusion $i \colon V' \hookrightarrow V$. This implies $i$ is an isomorphism, so that $V$ is finite-dimensional. 

In the converse direction, observe that $\hom(V, -)$ has a [[right adjoint]] (and [[left adjoints preserve colimits|hence preserves all colimits]]) if $V$ is finite-dimensional. 

To see this, first notice that the [[dual vector space]] $V^\ast$ of [[functionals]] $f \colon V \to k$ to the [[ground field]] is a [[dual object]] to $V$ in the [[category with duals|sense of monoidal category theory]], so that there is a [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] ([[evaluation map]])

$$
  \array{
    \mathllap{
      ev 
      \,\colon\, 
    }
    V^\ast \otimes V 
    &\longrightarrow& 
    k
    \\
    f \otimes v 
    &\mapsto& 
    f(v) 
    \mathrlap{\,.}
  }
$$ 
The [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] is uniquely determined from this counit and can be described using any [[linear basis]] $e_i$ of $V$ and dual basis $f_j$ as the map 

$$
  \array{
    \mathllap{
      coev
      \,\colon\,
    } 
    k 
    &
    \longrightarrow 
    &
    V \otimes V^\ast
    \\
    1 &\mapsto& \sum_i e_i \otimes f_i
    \mathrlap{\,.}
  }
$$ 

We thus have an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] 

$$
  (- \otimes_k V) 
    \;\;\dashv\;\; 
  (- \otimes V^\ast)
  \,,
$$
whose [[mate]] is, by the [[internal hom]]-adjunction $(-) \otimes V \;\dashv\; hom(C,-)$ of this form:

$$
  \hom(V, -) \;\dashv\; \hom(V^\ast, -)
$$ 

exhibiting the desired [[right adjoint]] to $hom(V,-)$.

###### Proposition

Finite-dimensional vector spaces are exactly the [[compact objects]] of [[Vect]] in the sense of [[locally presentable categories]], but also the compact = [[dualizable objects]] in the sense of [[monoidal category]] theory. In particular the category [[FinDimVect]] is a [[compact closed category]].
