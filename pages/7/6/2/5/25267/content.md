## Idea

In the context of [[machine learning]], *singular learning theory* applies results from [[algebraic geometry]] to [[statistical learning theory]]. In the case of learning algorithms, such as [[deep neural networks]], where there are multiple parameter values corresponding to the same [[statistical distribution]], the [[preimage]] of the target distribution may take the form of a [[singular point|singular]] subspace of the parameter space. Techniques from algebraic geometry may then be applied to study learning with such devices.
