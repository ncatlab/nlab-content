**Ofer Gabber** is an Israeli-French mathematician (with thesis under Barry [Mazur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Mazur)), famous for his technical excellence in a number of mathematical subjects, now a CNRS member [working](http://seven.ihes.fr/IHES-A/People/per-cnrsA.html) at [IHES](http://www.ihes.fr). Gabber has produced very many results from foundational results to counterexamples, mainly in [[algebraic geometry]], [[arithmetic geometry]], number theory, [[representation theory]] and [[algebra]], only small part of which are published, and many are known only indirectly via works of other mathematicians who were acquainted with his results.
