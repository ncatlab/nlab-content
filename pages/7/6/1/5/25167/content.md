## Definition

A **reduced local ring** is a [[commutative ring]] which is both a [[local ring]] and a [[reduced ring]], hence a commutative ring such that:

* The ring is nontrivial $0 \neq 1$;

* if the sum of two elements $x + y$ is equal to $1$, then $x$ is [[invertible]] or $y$ is invertible;

* every [[nilpotent element]] is equal to [[zero]]; equivalently, every element which squares to zero is equal to zero. 

## Examples

* Every [[Heyting field]] is a reduced local ring which is also a [[Artinian ring]]. 

* Given a [[discrete field]] $K$, the ring of [[power series]] $K[[x]]$ is a reduced local ring which is not a [[Heyting field]]. 

## Properties

The theory of reduced local rings is a [[coherent theory]]. 

## See also
