## Overview

This is a stub collecting information on the [[proof theory|proof theoretic]] strength of [[univalent type theory]] with [[higher inductive types]].

Setzer computes the strength of MLTT+W. Voevodsky reduces Coq's inductive types to W-types. Coquand et al reduces univalence and some HITs to an unspecified constructive framework, which can be taken to be CZF+REA with a sequence of 
universes. It follows from this work that univalent type theory and these HITs has the same proof theoretic strength as MLTT with inductive definitions and a sequence of universes.

There is an [MO-question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/69229/proof-strength-of-calculus-of-inductive-constructions) on the proof theoretic strength of pCIC. Avigad provide a general overview of the proof theory of predicative constructive systems.

## The strength of type theories

This section collects some references that establish the strength various type theories, roughly in increasing order of strength.

Let $\mathrm{ML}_n$ denote MLTT without inductive types and $n$ universes closed under $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$. This has the strength of the first-order system of $n$ iterated fixed points (whether with intuitionistic or classical logic), and thus by Feferman 1982 has proof-theoretic ordinal $\xi_n$, where $\xi_0=\varepsilon_0$ and $\xi_{n+1} = \varphi(\xi_n,0)$.
