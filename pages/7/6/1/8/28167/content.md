## Idea

In [[quantum physics]], the term *canonical quantization* refers, somewhat broadly, to [[quantization]] of (possibly [[constrained mechanics|constrained]]) [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical systems]] regarded in their [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formulation]], via [[symplectic geometry]] of [[phase spaces]]. It proceeds, ideally, by construction of [[Hilbert spaces]] [[space of quantum states|of]] [[quantum states]] on which [[algebras of quantum observables]], [[Planck's constant|$\hbar$]]-[[deformation quantization|deforming]] the [[Poisson algebra]] of classical [[observables]], are [[linear representation|represented]] by [[linear operators]] (the [[Schrödinger picture of quantum mechanics]]). 

The first examples of [[quantization]] encountered in traditional textbooks on [[quantum mechanics]] echo the historical roots of [[quantum theory]] (whence "canonical"),  where *[[canonical coordinates]]* $q$ and *[[canonical momenta]]* $p$ with their [[Poisson bracket]] $\{q,p\} = 1$ defined up to *[[canonical transformations]]* are promoted to [[multiplication]] [[linear operator|operators]] $\widehat{q}$ and [[differentiation]] [[linear operator|operators]] $\widehat{p} = -\mathrm{i}\hbar\partial/\partial q$ satisfying the *[[canonical commutation relation]]* $[\widehat{q}, \widehat{p}] = \mathrm{i}\hbar$. 

But in particular when applied to [[classical field theory]], this method crucially depends on a [[foliation]] of [[spacetime]] with [[spacelike]] leaves (or [[lightlike]] [[leaves]] for [[light cone quantization]]). While this exists at least on [[globally hyperbolic spacetimes]], such a choice breaks *manifest* local [[Lorentz group|Lorentz]]-[[symmetry]] and [[general covariance]]. Therefore canonical quantization is referred to in physics jargon as *non-covariant*. 

This is in contrast primarily to methods of quantization based on the [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian]] formulation of [[classical mechanics]], such as notably [[path integral]] methods and their derivatives, like the construction of [[scattering amplitude]] [[S-matrices]] via [[Feynman perturbation series]] used traditionally in [[perturbative quantum field theory]].

Indeed, canonical quantization lends itself to the more elusive ambition of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]. 

The archetypical non-trivial example of non-perturbative canonical quantization of non-[[free field|free]] [[field theories]] is the [[quantization of Chern-Simons theory]] specifically by [[geometric quantization]] of its [[phase space]] of [[flat connections]], producing a [[modular functor]] worth of [[Hilbert spaces]] of states.
