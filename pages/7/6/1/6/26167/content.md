## Idea

In [[simplicial type theory]] and [[bicubical type theory]] and related approaches to [[synthetic (infinity,1)-category theory]], the **op modality** is a [[modality]] $(-)^\op$ which takes a [[Segal type]], representing (infinity,1)-precategories, and turns it into the opposite [[Segal type]], representing the opposite (infinity,1)-precategory.
