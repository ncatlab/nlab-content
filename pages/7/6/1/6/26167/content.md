## Idea

In [[simplicial type theory]] and related approaches to [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] [[simplicial anima]], the **op modality** is a [[modality]] $(-)^\op$ which takes a type, representing simplicial anima, and turns it into the opposite type, representing the [[opposite simplicial anima]]. 

In particular, for [[(infinity,1)-category theory]], the modality can take a [[Rezk type]], representing [[(infinity,1)-categories]], and turns it into the opposite [[Rezk type]], representing the [[opposite (infinity,1)-category]].
