## Idea

_Continuum mechanics_ refers to the [[physics]]/[[mechanics]] of continuous bodies such as notably [[fluids]] but also [[solids]] ([[solid state physics]]). As opposed to the mechanics of point [[particles]] (to which it is of course related by various limiting processes).

## Related concepts

* [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]]

  * [[kinematics]], [[dynamics]]

  * [[rigid body dynamics]]

* [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], [[Lagrangian mechanics]]

* [[cohesion]], [[elasticity]], [[solidity]]

### Formalization

The [[axiom|axiomatization]] of [[continuum mechanics]] [[internal logic|internal]] to [[toposes]] has led [[William Lawvere]] to the introduction of [[synthetic differential geometry]]

### History

Early precursor of continuum mechanics has been argued to be recognizable in [[Descartes]]'s mechanism ([Dusek 99, p.23](#Dusek99)).
