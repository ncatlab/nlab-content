## Idea

_Continuum mechanics_ refers to the [[physics]]/[[mechanics]] of continuous bodies such as notably [[fluids]]. As opposed to the mechanics of point [[particles]] (to which it is of course related by various limiting processes).

## Related concepts

* [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]]

  * [[kinematics]], [[dynamics]]

  * [[rigid body dynamics]]

* [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], [[Lagrangian mechanics]]
