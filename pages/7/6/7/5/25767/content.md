## Selected writings

Early suggestion that [[confinement|confined]] [[QCD]] is described by regarding the [[color charge|color]]-[[flux tubes]] as [[string]]-like dynamical degrees of freedoms (cf. [gauge/string duality](AdS-QCD+correspondence#PolyakovGaugeStringDualityReferences)):

  > "The gauge-invariant configuration space consists of a collection of strings with quarks at their ends. The strings are lines of non-Abelian electric flux. In the strong coupling limit the dynamics is best described in terms of these strings. Quark confinement is a result of the inability to break a string without producing a pair. &lbrack;...&rbrack;"

  > "The confining mechanism is the appearance of one dimensional electric flux tubes which must link separated quarks. The appropriate description of the strongly coupled limit consists of a theory of interacting, propagating strings. &lbrack;...&rbrack;"

  > "This picture of the strongly coupled Yang-Mills theory in terms of a collection of stringlike flux lines is the central result of our analysis. It should be compared with the phenomenological use of stringlike degrees of freedom which has been widely used in describing hadrons."
