# The tropical semiring
* table of contents

## Definitions

The __tropical semiring__ is a [[semiring]] $(\mathbb{R}\cup \{\infty\},\oplus,\otimes)$ with addition $x\oplus y = min(x,y)$  and multiplication $x\otimes y = x+y$. (This is semiring in the sense of [[rig]], hence sometimes the __tropical rig__.) 

[[tropical geometry|Tropical geometry]] is often thought as the algebraic geometry over the tropical semiring.


## Terminology

The tropical rig is also called the [[min-plus algebra]]. There is a related, in fact isomorphic rig called the [[max-plus algebra]]. (Some authors use the term 'tropical algebra' for the max-plus rather than the min-plus algebra.  The theories, of course, run in parallel, as each is the negative of the other.) 

In his survey article, cited below, Pin uses the term for a wide range of similar idempotent semirings. For instance $\mathcal{M} = (\mathbb{N} \cup{\infty}, min, +)$ is a tropical semiring introduced by [[Imre Simon]] in 1978.


## Properties

* The tropical semiring is an example of an [[idempotent semiring]], since for all elements $x$, we have $x\oplus x=x$.


## Examples
 {#Examples}

In the min-plus algebra we have, for instance:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (5\oplus 6)\otimes 7 
    &
    = min(5,6) + 7
    \\
    & = 
    5 + 7
    \\
    & = 
    12
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$



## Applications

Apart from applications in [[tropical geometry]], the min-plus and max-plus algebras have extensive use in providing algebraic models for simple [[discrete event system]]s related to timed [[Petri nets]].
