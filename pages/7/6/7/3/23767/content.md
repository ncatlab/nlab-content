## Idea

What is called *symplectic K-theory* (denoted $K Sp$) or, equivalently, *quaternionic K-theory* (denoted $K Q$) is 
the [[topological K-theory]] of [[quaternionic vector bundles]].

This is in direct analogy with how [[complex K-theory]] ([[KU]]) is the topological K-theory of [[complex vector bundles]] and [[KO]] that of [[real vector bundles]].

In fact, quaternionic K-theory is equivalently [[KO-theory]] in degrees which are multiples of 4.

## Applications


### To topological phases of matter

In [[solid state physics]], under the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]], quaternionic K-theory is thought to classify [[crystal|crystalline]] [[topological insulator]]-phases of materials whose [[electron]]-dynamics respects [[time-reversal symmetry]] (this makes the classification be by [[KO-theory|$KO^\bullet$]]) but *no* [[parity symmetry]] (this restricts the classification further to $KO^{4 n} \simeq K Q^n$). Then spin-less such phases are classified by $K Q^0 \simeq K O^0$, while spin-ful such phases are classified by $K Q^1$.

In this context, the [[Kane-Mele invariant]] is a projection $K Q^1(\mathbb{T}^d) \to \mathbb{Z}/2$ from the quaternionic K-theory of the [[Brillouin torus]] of a material, which detects (in particular, for $d = 2$) the non-triviality of the [[graphene]]-phase (which is a [[time-reversal symmetry|time-reversal]]-symmetric [[topological insulator]] when its [[spin-orbit coupling]] is taken into account).
