## Idea

"Geometric algebra" is essentially a synonym for _[[Clifford algebra]]_, or, to some extent, for the [[spin geometry]] formulated in terms of Clifford algebra. The term "geometric algebra" is used and preferred in a school of thought following [Hestenes 66](#Hestenes66) that emphasizes the usefulness of making abstract Clifford algebra explicit in the exposition of geometry and physics on [[Minkowski spacetime]]. 

The perspective of "geometric algebra" may be seen as a third style of exposition and notation, in between 1) the traditional physics style of regarding Clifford algebra entirely in terms of it [[matrix]] [[representations]], and 2) the traditional mathematics style of defining them as [[quotients]] of [[tensor algebras]] by ideals defined by [[quadratic forms]]. The idea is that while the former approach (1) suffers from its basis-dependecy, the latter approach (2) tends to make the subject look more complicated to the novice and working physicist than it really is. 

In textbooks on "geometric algebra", Clifford algebra is instead introduced without choosing matrix representations, but highlighting the obvious [[generators and relations]]-presentation over the definition via [[quotients]] of [[tensor algebras]]. While the difference may seem inessential to the trained mathematician, it turns out that this perspectives helps open the subject to many working physicists. The enthusiasm about this perspective that [[David Hestenes]] reports to have experienced when he understood Clifford algebra in physics this way, back as a student, is what made "geometric algebra" become the school of thought that is today.
