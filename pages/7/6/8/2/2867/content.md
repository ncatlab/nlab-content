## Idea ##

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the category $\Theta_n$ -- **Joyal's disk category** -- may be thought of as the full subcategory of the category $Str n Cat$ of [[strict ∞-category|strict n-categories]] on $n$-categories that are something like free $n$-categories on pasting diagrams of $n$-[[globe]]s.

For instance $\Theta_2$ contains an object that is depicted

$$
  \array{
    & \nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow &&
    && \nearrow && \searrow 
    \\
    a && \to && b &\to & c && \Downarrow && b
    \\
    & \searrow &\Downarrow& \nearrow &&
    && \searrow && \nearrow &&
  }
$$

Such pasting diagrams may be encoded in planar trees, the above one corresponds to the tree:

$$
  \array{
    \nwarrow \nearrow &  & & \uparrow &&& 2
    \\
    & \nwarrow & \uparrow & \nearrow &&& 1
    \\
    && {*} 
  }
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, $\Theta_n$ is the category of planar rooted trees of level $\leq n$.


In low degree we have

* $\Theta_0 = *$ is the [[point]].

* $\Theta_1 = \Delta$ is the [[simplex category]]: the $n$-[[simplex]] $[n]$ is thought of as a linear [[quiver]] and as such the pasting diagram of $n$ 1-morphisms

  $$
    0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n
    \,.
  $$

  Dually, this is the planar rooted tree of the form

  $$
    \array{
      \nwarrow &\uparrow & \cdots \nearrow
      \\
      &{*}
    }
  $$

  with $n$-branches.




## Definition ##

Let $T(1)$ denote the free [[strict ∞-category]] generated from the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[globular set]] $1$. 

Notice that this terminal globular set consists of precisely one $k$-globe for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$: one point, one edge from the point to itself, one disk from from edge to itself, and so on. 

So $T(1)$ is freely generated under composition from these cells.
As described above, this means that each element of the underlying globular set of $T(1)$ may be depicted by a pasting diagram made out of [[globe]]s, and such a pasting diagram itself may be considered as a [[globular set]] whose $k$-cells are _instances_ of the $k$-globes appearing in the diagram. 

We now describe this formally. 

The $n$-cells of $T(1)$ may be identified with **planar [[tree]]s** $\tau$ of height $n$, which by definition are functors 

$$\tau: [n]^{op} \to \Delta$$ 

($\Delta$ is the category of [[simplex|simplices]] and $[n] \in \Delta$ is a simplex, i.e., ordered set $\{0 \lt 1 \lt \ldots \lt n\}$, regarded as a category) such that $\tau(0) = 1$. Such a $\tau$ is exhibited as a chain of morphisms in $\Delta$, 

$$\tau(n) \to \tau(n-1) \to \ldots \to \tau(0) = 1,$$ 

and we will denote each of the maps in the chain by $i$. Thus, for each $x \in \tau(k)$, there is a fiber $i^{-1}(x)$ which is a linearly ordered set. 
(Need to fill in how $\circ_j$ composition of such trees is defined.) 

To each planar tree $\tau$ we associate an underlying globular set $[\tau]$, as follows. Given $\tau$, define a new tree $\tau'$ where we adjoin a new bottom and top $x_0$, $x_1$ to every fiber $i^{-1}(x)$ of $\tau$, for every $x \in \tau(k)$: 

$$i_{\tau'}^{-1}(x) = \{x_0\} \cup i_{\tau}^{-1}(x) \cup \{x_1\}$$

Now define a $\tau$-**sector** to be a triple $(x, y, z)$ where $i(y) = x = i(z)$ and $y, z$ are consecutive edges of $i_{\tau'}^{-1}(x)$. A $k$-**cell** of the globular set $[\tau]$ is a $\tau$-sector $(x, y, z)$ where $x \in \tau(k)$. If $k \geq 1$, the **source** of a $k$-cell $(x, y, z)$ is the $(k-1)$-cell $(i(x), u, x)$ and the **target** is the $(k-1)$-cell $(i(x), x, v)$ where $u \lt x \lt v$ are consecutive elements in $i_{\tau'}^{-1}(i(x))$. It is trivial to check that the globular axioms are satisfied. 

Now let $T([\tau])$ denote the free strict $\omega$-category generated by the globular set $[\tau]$. 

**Definition:** $\Theta$ is the full [[subcategory]] of $\omega$-Cat determined by $\omega$-categories $T([\tau])$, as $\tau$ ranges over cells in the underlying globular set of $T(1)$. 

### Examples ###

In $\Theta_0$ write $O_0$ for the unique object. Then write in $\Theta_n$ 

$$
  O_n := [1](O_{n-1})
  \,.
$$

This is the strict [[n-category]] free on a single $n$-[[globe]].

## Theta-spaces ##

A local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on the Theta categories is called [[Theta space]]s and models [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-categories]].
