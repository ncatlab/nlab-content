## Definition

The __trivial ring__, or __zero ring__, is the [[ring]] with a single [[element]], which is both $0$ and $1$. 

One usually denote the trivial ring as $0$ or $\{0\}$, even though $1$ or $\{1\}$ would make as much sense. 

The **trivial rig** or **zero rig** is the [[rig]] with a single [[element]], which is both $0$ and $1$. By definition of [[neutral element]], this single element is its own additive inverse, making the trivial rig the same as the trivial ring. 

## Properties

* The trivial ring is the only ring in which $0 = 1$, since if that is the case then it follows for all elements $x$ that $x = 1 x = 0 x = 0$.

* The trivial ring is the [[terminal object]] in [[Rings]]. It is both [[terminal object|terminal]] and [[initial object|initial]] (hence a [[zero object]]) in the category of [[nonunital rings]], but it is not initial in [[Rings]] (defined as the category of [[unital rings]] and unital ring homomorphisms).  In fact, there are no unital ring homomorphisms from the trivial ring to any nontrivial ring, hence it is a [[strict terminal object]] there.

* The trivial ring is an example of a [[trivial algebra]].

* Every ring is a [[0-truncated]] [[ring groupoid]], and the trivial ring is the terminal ring groupoid. 

* If one takes the definition of a [[field]] from [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010), then the [[trivial ring]] is a [[terminal object]] in the [[category]] [[Field]] of [[fields]]. 

* The trivial ring is a [[discrete ring]] and is the terminal object of both the category of [[tight apartness rings]] and the category of [[discrete rings]].
