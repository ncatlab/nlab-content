## Definition

The __trivial ring__, or __zero ring__, is the [[ring]] with a single [[element]], which is both $0$ and $1$.  

One usually denote the trivial ring as $0$ or $\{0\}$, even though $1$ or $\{1\}$ would make as much sense.  

## Properties

* The trivial ring is the only ring in which $0 = 1$, since if that is the case then it follows for all elements $x$ that $x = 1 x = 0 x = 0$.

* The trivial ring is the [[terminal object]] in [[Rings]]. It is both [[terminal object|terminal]] and [[initial object|initial]] (hence a [[zero object]]) in the category of [[nonunital rings]], but it is not initial in [[Rings]] (defined as the category of [[unital rings]] and unital ring homomorphisms).  In fact, there are no unital ring homomorphisms from the trivial ring to any nontrivial ring, hence it is a [[strict terminal object]] there.

* The trivial ring is an example of a [[trivial algebra]].
