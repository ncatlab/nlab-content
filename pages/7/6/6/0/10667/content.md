## Idea

Since there are several meanings of _[[spectrum]]_ there are accordingly several things one may mean by "spectral geometry". Most of those belong
either to the geometry as seen either by point spectra of [[spectral theory]] (of operators, families of operators, operator algebras, rings, associative algebras, abelian categories etc.), or by spectra in the sense of [[stable homotopy theory]] like [[symmetric spectra]], $E_\infty$-spectra, ring spectra...


### Geometry seen by operator spectra

For the notion of [[spectrum of an operator]] spectral geometry is geometry as seen by the spectra of operators, which is geometry as seen by [[spectral triple]] (often inaccurately referred to  "[[noncommutative geometry]]").

### Geometry modeled on duals of $E_\infty$-rings 

For the notion of [[spectrum]] as in [[stabilization]] in [[stable homotopy theory]], spectral geometry is geometry over [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of [[E-∞ rings]] (the full version of [[derived algebraic geometry]]). 

See at _[[E-∞ geometry]]_.
