## Idea

KK-theory is a "bivariant" version of [[operator K-theory]]: for $A, B$ two [[operator algebras]] there, their _KK-group_ $KK(A,B)$ behaves in the first argument as K-homology of $A$ and in the second as K-cohomology of $B$.

There is a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] and in particular a [[triangulated category]] of operator algebras such that $KK(-,-)$ is the [[hom-set]] of the corresponding [[homotopy category]] ([Lean](#Lean))

Accordingly, the groups $KK(A,B)$ are now viewed as a "correct" hom-set among noncommutative operator algebras for the purpose of various homotopy-invariant functors. 

KK-theory was introduced by [[Gennady Kasparov]] in 1980, prompted by the advances in [[Brown-Douglas-Fillmore theory]], especially in the last 1977 article.
