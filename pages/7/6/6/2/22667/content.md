## Definitions

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] (or any [[ring]]).

An element $x$ of $R$ is a __divisor__ of an element $y$ of $R$ if there exists an element $z$ of $R$ such that $z x = y$.

If $R$ is (or may be) non-commutative, then we may distinguish __left__ and __right__ divisors in the usual way.
