## Idea

Roughly, "integrating" a [[partial differential equation]] means to find a [[solution]] for it, usually understood with special properties, such as having prescribed boundary data (initial data), and/or having "closed form", such as expression by [[quadratures]] ("[[integrable systems]]") and/or having prescribed [[domain]] (e.g. over [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] in [[formal integrability]]).  A [[PDE]] is "integrable" in a prescribed sense if it admits solutions in this prescribed sense.
