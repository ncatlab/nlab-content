##Projective and injective Banach space##

Very incomplete!


(I wasn't sure how to title this page, so the name just mentions projective Banach(able) spaces, even though I hope to eventually get onto injective Banach(able) spaces.)

### Definition to go here ###
Let $P$ be a Banach space. We say $P$ is projective if ...

### The example ###
Let $S$ be any set and let $\ell^1(S)$ be the free Banach space on $S$. (Should link this to some discussion on the relevant adjunction: this free functor is left adjoint to the closed-unit ball functor.) Then $\ell^1(S)$ is a projective Banach(able) space.

It turns out that every projective Banach(able) space is isomorphic as a Banach(able) space to $\ell^1(S)$ for some set $S$. In the separable case this is more or less a consequence of a standard machine which applies more generally and goes by the name of "block bases plus Pelczynski decomposition". The non-separable case was thrashed out a bit later by K&#246;the (citation needed). 

YC has often wondered if this result has any meaningful kinship with the Nielsen-Schreier theorem. He usually ends up deciding "probably not".


### Comments on attempts at equivalent formulations ###

In an abelian category $C$ one sometimes (often?) sees the following definition of a projective object: an object $P$ is projective in $C$ if the Hom-functor $C(P,\cdot)$ is (right) exact. (I think it is always left exact?)

Now the categories of Banach spaces and Banachable spaces each possess notions of zero object, kernel and cokernel. So we could define exactness in terms of these. But now 'exactness' in this sense of a short exact sequence of Banach(able) spaces does not imply exactness of the underlying short exact sequence of vector spaces!

Put another way: as we (will) have defined it above, projectivity of a Banach space $P$ is stronger than merely asking that the functor $\operatorname{hom}(P,\cdot)$ preserves epimorphisms...

[[David Roberts]]: I suppose it's about asking what you want to do with said projective objects - projective resolutions? Calculate some sort of cohomology? Know that every epimorphism (or analogous map - perhaps the quotient map of a ses?) to a projective object splits?
