## Idea

The sporadic finite simple groups are the [[exceptional structures]] among [[finite groups]]:

According to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], there are 18 countably infinite families and 26 _sporadic_ simple groups. The latter groups do not fit into any systematic classification, but there are a number of links between them. For example, the [[Monster group]] $M$, the largest of the sporadic groups, contains all but six (the 'pariahs', $J_1, J_3,Ru,ON,Ly,J_4$) of the other sporadic groups as subquotients. These 20 sporadic groups comprise what is termed the 'Happy Family' by [[Robert Griess]], ([Griess 98](#Griess98)). 

The _Happy Family_ is taken to be formed of three generations

* First: five subquotients of the [[Mathieu group]] $M_{24}$ = symmetries of the [[binary Golay code]]
* Second: seven subquotients of the [[Conway group]] $Co_1$ = symmetries of the [[Leech lattice]], $mod \{\pm 1\}$.
* Third: eight subquotients of the [[Monster group]] = conformal symmetries of the [[monster vertex operator algebra]]
