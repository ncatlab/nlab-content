## Idea 

Given a [[functor]] $p\colon  X \to Y$ between categories one may ask for each [[morphism]] $f\colon  y_1 \to y_2$ if given a lift of its target
$$
  \array{
    X &&& && \hat y_2
    \\
    \downarrow^p 
    \\
    Y &&& y_1 &\stackrel{f}{\to}& y_2
  }
$$

there is a _universal_ lift of $f$

$$
  \array{
    X &&& \hat y_1 &\stackrel{\hat f}{\to}& \hat y_2
    \\
    \downarrow^p 
    \\
    Y &&& y_1 &\stackrel{f}{\to}& y_2
  }
  \,.
$$

There may also be other lifts of $f$, but the universal one is essentially unique, as usual for anything having a [[universal property]].  Specifically, $\hat f$ in $X$ is essentially uniquely determined by its target $\hat y_2$ and its image $f = p(\hat f)$ in $Y$, and is called a __cartesian morphism__.  A morphism which is cartesian relative to $p^{op}\colon X^{op}\to Y^{op}$ is called __opcartesian__ or __cocartesian__.

If there are enough cartesian morphisms in $Y$, they may be used to define [[functor]]s

$$
  f^* : X_{y_2} \to X_{y_1}
$$

between the [[fiber]]s of $p$ over $y_1$ and $y_2$. 

This way a functor $p : X \to Y$ with enough Cartesian morphisms -- called a [[Cartesian fibration]] or [[Grothendieck fibration]] -- determines and is determined by a fiber-assigning functor $Y \to Cat^{op}$.

This has its analog in [[higher category theory|higher categories]].


## Definition

### In categories

#### Traditional definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(cartesian morphism)**

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a [[functor]]. A [[morphism]] $f : x_1 \to x_2$ in the [[category]] $X$ is **strongly cartesian** with respect to $p$ (nowdays often just *cartesian*), or (strongly) **$p$-cartesian** if for every $x'\in X$, 
for every $h:x'\to x_2$ and every
$u:p(x')\to p(x_1)$ such that $p(h) = p(f) u$, there exists a unique $v:x'\to x_1$ such that $h = f v$ and $u = p(v)$:

$$
  \array{
    \forall x'
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exists! v}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\forall h}}
    \\
    x_1 &\stackrel{f}{\to}& x_2
  }
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \stackrel{p}{\mapsto}
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    p(x')
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\forall u}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{p(h)}}
    \\
    p(x_1) &\stackrel{p(f)}{\to}& p(x_2)
  }
$$

In imprecise words: for all commuting triangles in $Y$ (involving $p(f)$ as above) and all lifts through $p$ of its 2-[[horn]] to $X$ (involving $f$ as above), there is a unique refinement to a lift of the entire commuting triangle.

We can make this definition slightly more explicit by working with the fibres of $p$: let $X_x$ denote $p^{-1}(y)$, the set of objects living over $y$; and, for $f : y \to y'$, $x : X_y$ and $x' : X_{y'}$, let $X_f(x,x')$ denote $p^{-1}(f) \cap X(x,x')$, the set of morphisms from $x$ to $x'$ that $p$ maps to $f$.

Then for $x : X_y$, $x' : X_{y'}$ and $f : y' \to y$, a morphism $\bar f : X_f(x',x)$ is *cartesian* iff for any $u : y'' \to y'$, $x'' : X_{y''}$ and $h : X_{f \circ u}(x'', x)$, there is a unique $\bar u : X_u(x'',x')$ with $h = \bar f \circ \bar u$. This can be expressed in the following diagram, where the upper objects and morphisms live in $X$ over their corresponding data in $Y$:

\begin{tikzcd}
y'' \arrow[d, dotted, maps to] \arrow[rd, "\exists ! \bar u", dashed] \arrow[rrd, "h", bend left] &                                                   &                              \\
x'' \arrow[rd, "u"]                                                                               & y' \arrow[d, dotted, maps to] \arrow[r, "\bar f"] & y \arrow[d, dotted, maps to] \\
                                                                                                  & x' \arrow[r, "f"]                                 & x                           
\end{tikzcd}

There is a weaker universal property, originally devised by Grothendieck and Gabriel, where one requires above lifting property only for $u = id_{p(x_1)}$.  Morphisms satisfying this universal property have in recent years been called [[locally cartesian morphisms]], although historically they have been called simply cartesian, or rarely weak cartesian. In Grothendieck's [[fibered categories]] (see below), cartesian in the strong sense and cartesian in the weak sense are equivalent properties of morphisms.  

Equivalently, a morphism $f:x\to x^\prime$ is called locally $p$-cartesian (relative to a functor $X\to Y$) if it is cartesian with respect to the projection functor $p_{pf}:X_{pf}\to \mathbf{2}$ where $X_{pf}$ is the (homotopy) pullback of $X$ along the functor $c_{pf}:\mathbf{2}\to Y$ classifying the arrow $pf:px\to px^\prime$ in $Y$.

If we pass to the [[nerve]] $N(X)$ and $N(Y)$ of the categories, then in terms of diagrams in [[sSet]] this means that the morphism $f : x \to y$ is $p$-cartesian precisely if for all [[horn]] inclusions

$$
  \array{
    \Delta^{\{1,2\}}
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^f
    \\
    \Lambda_2[2] &\to& N(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \Delta[2] &\to& N(Y)
  }
$$

such that the last edge of the 2-[[horn]] is the given edge $f$, a unique lift $\sigma$

$$
  \array{
    \Delta^{\{1,2\}}
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^f
    \\
    \Lambda_2[2] &\to& N(X)
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^\sigma\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \Delta[2] &\to& N(Y)
  }
$$

exists. 


=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(Grothendieck fibration)**

If for every morphism in $Y$ and every lift of its target there is at least one lift which has as its target the chosen one and is a $p$-cartesian morphism in the strong sense, one says that $p$ is a __fibered category__ (also called [[Grothendieck fibration]]). Equivalently, 

* ($p$ is [[prefibered category]]) for every morphism in $Y$ and every lift of its target there is at least one lift through $p$ which has as its target the chosen one and is a $p$-cartesian morphism in the weak sense 

*and* 

* the composition of every two composable $p$-cartesian morphisms (in the weak sense) is a $p$-cartesian morphism (in the weak sense). 
=--


#### Reformulations {#CartInOrdCatReformulation}

We discuss equivalent reformulations of the above definition of Cartesian
morphism that lend themselves better to generalization to 
[[higher category theory]].

For the following, we need this notation: let 

* $X/x_2$ by the [[overcategory]] of $X$ over the object $x_2$;

* $Y/p(x_2)$ the corresponding [[overcategory]] of $Y$ over $p(x_2)$;

* $X/f$ the category whose objects 

  $$
    Obj(X/f) = 
    \left\{

    \array{
       && a
       \\
       &\swarrow && \searrow
       \\
       x_1 &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& x_2
    }
    \right\}
  $$
 
  are objects $a$ of $X$ equipped with morphisms to $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that the obvious triangle commutes, and whose morphisms are morphisms between these tip objects such that all diagrams in sight commute.

* similarly for $Y/p(f)$.



+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The condition that $f \in Mor X$ is a Cartesian morphism with respect to $p : X \to Y $  is equivalent to the condition that the functor

$$
  \phi : X/f \to X/{x_2} \times_{Y/{p(x_2)}} Y/p(f)
$$

into the (strict) [[pullback]] of the obvious projection $X/{x_2} \to Y/p(x_2)$ along the projection $Y/p(f) \to Y/p(x_2)$ induced by the commutativity of

$$
  \array{
    X/f &\stackrel{\phi_2}{\to}& Y/p(f)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\phi_1}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X/{x_2} &\to& Y/{p(x_2)}
  }
$$

is a [[k-surjective functor|surjective equivalence]], and this in turn is equivalent to it being an [[isomorphism]] of categories.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is immediate to see that $\phi$ being an isomorphism of categories is equivalent to the condition that $f$ is a Cartesian morphism. We discuss that just the condition that $\phi$ is a surjective equivalence already implies that it is an isomorphism of categories.

So assume now that $\phi$ is a surjective equivalence.

Notice that objects in the pullback category are compatible pairs

$$
  \left(
  \left(
  \array{
     && a 
     \\
     &&& \searrow
     \\
     x_1 &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& x_2
  }
  \right) \in X/_{x_2}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     && b 
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     p(x_1) &&\stackrel{p(f)}{\to}&& p(x_2)
  }
  \right)
   \in Y/p(f)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

We have that $\phi$ being _surjective_ on object means that every such pair is in the image of some object 

$$
  \left(
  \array{
     && a 
     \\
     &{}^{\mathllap{g}}\swarrow&& \searrow
     \\
     x_1 &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& x_2
  }
  \right)
  \in X_{f}
  \,,
$$

and hence that every filler _exists_ . Assume two such fillers $g$ and $g'$. Then by the fact that an [[equivalence of categories]] is a surjection (even an isomorphism) on corresponding hom-sets, it follows that there exists (even uniquely) a morphism in $X/f$ connecting them 

$$
  \array{
     && a
     \\
     &{}^{\mathllap{g}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}} & \searrow
     \\
     && a
    \\
     \downarrow & {}^{\mathllap{g'}}\swarrow && \searrow & \downarrow
     \\
     x_1 &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& x_2
  }
$$

such that this maps under $\phi$ to the identity morphism in the pullback category. But in particular this maps to the morphism

$$
  \array{
     && a
     \\
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}} & \searrow
     \\
     && a
    \\
     & && \searrow & \downarrow
     \\
      &&&& x_2
  }
$$

in $X/{x_2}$ and evidently is the identity there if and only if $h$ is the identity. Hence this maps also to the identity in the pullback category if and only if $h$ is the identity. So $h$ must be the identity. So if two lifts of an object through the surjective equivalence $\phi$ exist, they must already be equal. Hence the surjective equivalence $\phi$ is even an isomorphism on objects and hence an isomorphism of categories.

### In $(\infty,1)$-categories

The notion of cartesian morphism generalizes from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category theory]]. The definition given above can be rephrased as a pullback relation between homsets, which we can take as an abstract definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(cartesian edge in an $(\infty,1)$-category)**

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a functor of [[(∞,1)-categories]]. Then, a [[morphism]] $f : x \to x'$ in $X$ is **$p$-cartesian** if and only if the commutative square induced by the distributivity of $p$ over composition 

  \begin{centre}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      X(a,x) \arrow[r, "{X(a,f)}"] \arrow[d, "p"]
      & X(a,x') \arrow[d, "p"]
      \\ Y(p(a),p(x)) \arrow[r, "{Y(p(a),p(f))}"]
      & Y(p(a),p(x'))
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{centre}


is a pullback square for every $a \in X$.

=--

Similarly, the reformulation in terms of slice/cone categories generalizes directly, and is indeed equivalent to the definition given above:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a functor of [[(∞,1)-categories]]. Then, a [[morphism]] $f : x \to x'$ in $X$ is $p$-cartesian iff the commutative square

  \begin{centre}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      X_{/x} \arrow[r, "{f_!}"] \arrow[d, "p"]
      & X_{/x'} \arrow[d, "p"]
      \\ Y_{/p(x)} \arrow[r, "{p(f)_!}"]
      & Y_{/p(x')}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{centre}


is a pullback square.

=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The definition of being $p$-cartesian can be described as a pullback square of hom-functors. By the contravariant [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]], $X(-, x)$ classifies the [[right fibration]], $X_{/x} \to X$, and $Y(p-, p(x))$ classifies the pullback of $Y_{/p(x)} \to Y$ along $p$; that is by the [[comma category]] $(p \downarrow p(x)) \to Y$. There is a commutative diagram


  \begin{centre}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      X_{/x} \arrow[r, "{f_!}"] \arrow[d]
      & X_{/x'} \arrow[d]
      \\ (p \downarrow p(x)) \arrow[r] \arrow[d]
      & (p \downarrow p(x')) \arrow[r] \arrow[d]
      & X \arrow[d, "p"]
      \\ Y_{/p(x)} \arrow[r, "{p(f)_!}"]
      & Y_{/p(x')} \arrow[r] & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{centre}

The bottom-right square and wide rectangle are pullbacks by construction. By the [[pasting law]], the bottom-left square is a pullback, and thus the top-left square is a pullback if and only if the tall rectangle is.

By the [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]], the top-left square is a pullback iff $f$ is $p$-cartesian, so the proposition follows.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $f : x \to y$, then $X_{/f} \to X_{/x}$ is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]], and composing its inverse with $X_{/f} \to X_{/x}$ is the [[dependent sum]] $f_! : X_{/x} \to X_{/y}$.

=--


To make this concrete, we can also discuss adaptations of the abstract idea to two different models of [[(∞,1)-category]] theory:  [[quasi-categories]] and [[simplicially enriched categories|sSet categories]].

#### In quasi-categories

We formulate a notion **cartesian edge** or _cartesian morphism_ in a [[simplicial set]] $X$ relative to a morphism $p : X \to Y$ of simplicial sets. In the case that these simplicial sets are [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] -- i.e. simplicial set incarnations of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] -- this yields a notion of cartesian morphisms in $(\infty,1)$-categories.

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[simplicial set]]s.
Let $f : x_1 \to x_2$ be an edge in $X$, i.e. a morphism $f : \Delta^1 \to X$.

Recall the notion of [[over quasi-category]] obtained from the notion of [[join of quasi-categories]]. Using this we obtain [[simplicial set]]s $X/f$, $X/{x_2}$, $S/p(f)$ and $S/p(x_2)$ in generalization of the categories considered in the above definition of cartesian morphisms in categories.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
**(cartesian edge in a simplicial set)**

Let $p : X \to Y$ be an [[inner Kan fibration]] of simplicial sets.

Then a [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in $X$ is **$p$-cartesian** if the induced morphism

$$
  X_{/f} \to X_{/y} \times_{Y_{/p(y)}} Y_{/p(f)}
$$

into the [[pullback]] in [[sSet]]
is an acyclic [[Kan fibration]].

=--


This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def 2.4.1.1]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The morphism $f : x \to y$ as above, for $p : X \to Y$ an [[inner fibration]], is $p$-cartesian precisely if for all $n \geq 2$ and all right outer [[horn]] inclusions

$$
  \array{
    \Delta^{\{n-1,n\}}
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^f
    \\
    \Lambda[n]_n &\to& X

(with $\Lambda[n]_n$ the $n$th [[horn]] of the $n$-[[simplex]]) such that the last edge of the horn is the given edge $f$, a lift $\sigma$

###### Remark

This means that an [[inner fibration]] $p : X \to Y$ with a collection of $p$-cartesian morphisms in $X$ specified satisfies the same kind of condition as a _[[right fibration]]_ , the only difference being that not _all_ right outer horns inclusion are required to have lifts, but only those where the last edge of the horn maps to a cartesian morphism.

In this sense a [[Cartesian fibration]] is a generalization of a [[right fibration]].

## Properties

### Pullback along Cartesian morphisms

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $p : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{C}$ a functor, if in a diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    C &\stackrel{k}{\to}& D
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{E}$ the two vertical morphisms are vertical with respect to $p$ (meaning that $p(g) = Id_p(A)$ and $p(h) = Id(B)$) and if the two horizontal morphisms are $p$-Cartesian morphisms, then this square is a [[pullback]] square.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If 

$$
  \array{
    Q &\stackrel{}{\to}& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}
    \\
    C &\stackrel{k}{\to}& D
  }
$$

is another cone over $C \to D \leftarrow B$, then its image under $p$
is 

$$
  \array{
    p(Q)
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow
    \\
    p(C) &\stackrel{p(k)}{\to}& D
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $p(f) = p(k)$, another lift of the right horn of this is given by

$$
  \array{
    Q
    \\
    & \searrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
$$

which gives a unique filler $Q \to A$ by the fact that $f$ is Cartesian.

But this produces now two fillers -- namely the original $Q \to C$ and the $Q \to A \to C$ just obtained -- of the horn

$$
  \array{
    Q &\to& B
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    C &\stackrel{k}{\to}& D
  }

$$
  \array{
    p(Q)
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow
    \\
    p(C) &\stackrel{p(k)}{\to}& D

Since $k$ is Cartesian, these two fillers must be equal. This means that the morphism $Q \to A$ is a cone morphism and unique as such. Hence the original square is a pullback.

This appears as [[Elephant|Elephant, lemma 1.3.3]].


### Cartesian morphisms and equivalences


+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Observation

For $C$ a [[category]], a [[morphism]] in $C$ is cartesian with respect to the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[functor]] $C \to *$ precisely if it is an [[isomorphism]].

In particular all [[identity]] morphisms are cartesian.

This is trivial to see. The analog statement holds also for [[quasi-categories]], where it is rather more nontrivial and quite useful:

###### Proposition

For $C$ a [[quasi-category]], a morphism in $C$ is cartesian with respect to the [[terminal object|terminal]] morphism $C \to *$ precisely if it is an [[equivalence in a quasi-category|equivalence]].

More generally, for $p : X \to Y$ an [[inner fibration]], a morphism $f$ in $X$ is an [[equivalence in a quasi-category|equivalence]] precisely if it is $p$-cartesian and $p(f)$ is an equivalence in $Y$.

###### Proof

The first statement is a proposition of [[Andre Joyal]], slightly reformulated in the language of cartesian morphisms. It appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop 1.2.4.3]]. A proof appears below [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, corollary 2.1.2.2]].

The second statement is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 2.4.1.5]].
