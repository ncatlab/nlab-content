## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] a _threshold correction_ to an [[effective field theory]] is an adjustment to its [[renormalization group flow]] due to effects in the full theory  that are being ignored in the effective field theory; for instance the presence of further [[particles]] of high [[mass]] in the full theory which do not preserve some [[symmetry]] seen in the effective field theory.
