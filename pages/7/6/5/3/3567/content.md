The [[category]] $Ho(Top)$ is the [[homotopy category]] of [[Top]] with respect to [[category with weak equivalences|weak equivalences]] given by [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s.

The study of $HoTop$ was the motivating example of [[homotopy theory]]. Often $HoTop$ is called _the_ homotopy category.

Notice the distinction between $Ho(Top)$ for [[Top]] regarded as the category of _all_ [[topological space]]s and that for [[Top]] regarded only as the subcategory on spaces of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]]. By the [[homotopy hypothesis]] the latter is equivalent for instance to the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(sSet_{Quillen})$ of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]. 

The category $Ho(Top)$ of _all_ topological spaces can be studied by testing its objects with objcts from $Ho(sSet_{Quillen}) \simeq Ho(CWCplx)$. This is the topic of [[shape theory]].
