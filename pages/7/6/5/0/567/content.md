A _dual adjunction_ between [[category|categories]] $C$ and $D$ is an [[adjunction]] between the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ of $C$ and $D$.

The concept arises in the context of [[duality]].

Dual adjunctions between [[concrete category|concrete categories]] may be represented by [[dualizing object]]s.
