##Idea
A point in a space, $X$,  can be thought of as a continuous function from a singleton space to $X$. In algebraic geometry, the 'spaces' come with more structure as they are [[scheme]]s and singletons correspond to the [[prime spectrum|spectra]] of fields.


Suppose a scheme $S$ is defined over  a field $k$, so is equipped with a morphism to $Spec (k)$. 

A geometric point $\xi$ in $S$ is a morphism from $Spec(\overline{k}))$ to $S$ where $\overline{k}$ is an algebraic closure of $k$.
