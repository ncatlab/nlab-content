###### Definition

Let $M,N$ be a pair of [[group|groups]] (not necessarily abelian) endowed with an [[action]] $\rho$ of $M$ on $N$, and an action $\sigma$ of $N$ on $M$. The *tensor product* $M\otimes N$ is generated by elements of the form $m\otimes n$ satisfying

* $(mm')\otimes n = (mm' m^{-1} \otimes \rho(m)(n))(m\otimes n),$

* $m\otimes (nn') = (m\otimes n)(\sigma(n)(m)\otimes nn' n^{-1} ),$

for $m,m'\in M$ and $n,n'\in N$.

###### Remark
This is to be understood as the generalization of the [[tensor product of abelian groups]], since as one can verify, whenever $M,N$ act trivially on each other, one has that 

$$
M\otimes N\cong M^{ab} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} N^{ab}.
$$
