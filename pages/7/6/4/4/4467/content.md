## Idea

Formal topology is a programme for doing [[topology]] in a [[finite mathematics|finite]], [[predicative mathematics|predicative]], and [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] fashion.

It is a kind of [[pointless topology]]; in the context of [[classical mathematics]], it reproduces the theory of [[locales]] rather than [[topological spaces]] (although of course one can recover topological spaces from locales).

The basic definitions can be motivated by an attempt to study locales entirely through the [[posites]] that generate them.  However, in order to recover all basic topological notions (particularly those associated with *closed* rather than *open* features) predicatively, we need to add a 'positivity' relation to the 'coverage' relation of sites.


## Definitions

A __formal topology__ or __formal space__ is a [[set]] $S$ together with

*  an [[element]] $\top$ of $S$,
*  a [[binary operation]] $\cap$ on $S$,
*  a [[binary relation]] $\lhd$ between elements of $S$ and [[subsets]] of $S$, and
*  a [[unary relation]] $\Diamond$ on $S$,

such that

1.  $a = b$ whenever $a \lhd \{b\}$ and $b \lhd \{a\}$,
2.  $a \lhd U$ whenever $a \in U$,
3.  $a \lhd V$ whenever $a \lhd U$ and $x \lhd V$ for all $x \in U$,
4.  $a \cap b \lhd U$ whenever $a \lhd U$ or $b \lhd U$,
5.  $a \lhd \{ x \cap y \;|\; x \in U,\; y \in V \}$ whenever $a \lhd U$ and $a \lhd V$,
6.  $a \lhd \{\top\}$,
7.  $\Diamond x$ for some $x \in U$ whenever $\Diamond a$ and $a \lhd U$, and
8.  $a \lhd U$ whenever $a \lhd U$ if $\Diamond a$,

for all $a$, $b$, $U$, and $V$.

We interpret the elements of $S$ as __basic opens__ in the formal space.  We call $\top$ the __[[improper subset|entire space]]__ and $a \cap b$ the __[[intersection]]__ of $a$ and $b$.  We say that $a$ is __covered__ by $U$ or that $U$ is a __[[cover]]__ of $a$ if $a \lhd U$.  We say that $a$ is __positive__ or __[[inhabited subset|inhabited]]__ if $\Diamond a$.  (For a [[topological space]] equipped with a strict [[topological base]] $S$, taking these intepretations literally does in fact define a formal space; see the Examples.)

Some immediate points to notice:

*  If we drop (1), then the hypothesis of (1) defines an [[equivalence relation]] on $S$ which is a [[congruence]] for $\top$, $\cap$, $\lhd$, and $\Diamond$, so that we may simply pass to the [[quotient set]].  In appropriate foundations, we can even allow $S$ to be a [[preset]] originally, then use (1) as a definition of equality.
*  We can prove that $(S,\cap,\top)$ is a bounded [[semilattice]]; if (as the notation suggests) we interpret this as a [[meet]]-semilattice, then $a \leq b$ if and only if $a \lhd \{b\}$.  Conversely, we could require that $(S,\cap,\top)$ be a semilattice originally, then let (1) say that $a \leq b$ whenever $a \lhd \{b\}$.
*  We can prove that $\Diamond a$ holds iff every cover of $a$ is inhabited and that $\Diamond a$ fails iff $a \lhd \empty$.  Accordingly, this predicate is uniquely definable (in two equivalent ways, one impredicative and one nonconstructive) in a classical treatment; only in a treatment that is both predicative and constructive do we need to include it in the axioms.  See [[positivity predicate]].

## Examples

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and let $S$ be the collection of [[open subsets]] of $X$.  Let $\top$ be $X$ itself, and let $a \cap b$ be the literal intersection of $a$ and $b$ for $a, b \in S$.  Let $a \lhd U$ if and only $U$ is literally an [[open cover]] of $a$, and let $\Diamond a$ if and only if $a$ is literally inhabited.  Then $(S,\top,\cap,\lhd,\Diamond)$ is a formal topology.

The above example is impredicative (since the collection of open subsets is generally large), but now let $S$ be a [[base for the topology]] of $X$ which is strict in the sense that it is closed under finitary [[intersection]].  Let the other definitions be as before.  Then $(S,\top,\cap,\lhd,\Diamond)$ is a formal topology.

More generally, let $B$ be a [[subbase]] for the topology of $X$, and let $S$ be the [[free monoid]] on $B$, that is the set of [[finite lists]] of elements of $B$ (so this example is not strictly finitist), modulo the [[equivalence relation]] by which two lists are identified if their [[intersections]] are equal.  Let $\top$ be the [[empty list]], let $a \cap b$ be the [[concatenation]] of $a$ and $b$, let $a \lhd U$ if the intersection of $a$ is contained in the [[union]] of the intersections of the elements of $U$, and let $\Diamond a$ if the intersection of $a$ is inhabited.  Then $(S,\top,\cap,\lhd,\Diamond)$ is a formal topology.

Let $X$ be an [[accessible locale]] generated by a [[posite]] whose underlying [[poset]] $S$ is a (meet)-[[semilattice]].  Let $\top$ and $\cap$ be as in the semilattice structure on $S$, and let $a \lhd U$ if $U$ contains a basic cover (in the posite structure on $S$) of $a$.  Then we get a formal topology, defining $\Diamond$ in the unique way.

The last example is not predicative, and this is in part *why* one studies formal topologies instead of sites, if one wishes to be strictly predicative.  (It still needs to be motivated that we want $\Diamond$ at all.)

## In dependent type theory

### Impredicative definition

In [[dependent type theory]], let $(\Omega, \mathrm{El}_\Omega)$ be the [[type of all propositions]], and let the relation $a \in_S A$ for $a:S$ and $A:S \to \Omega$ as

$$a \in_S A \coloneqq \mathrm{El}_\Omega(A(a))$$

The singleton subtype function is a function $\{-\}:S \to (S \to \Omega)$, such that for all elements $a:S$, $p(a):a \in_S \{a\}$, and for all functions $R:S \to (S \to \Omega)$ such that for all elements $a:S$, $p_R(a):a \in_S R(a)$, the type of functions $(b \in_S \{a\}) \to (b \in_S R(a))$ is contractible for all $a:A$ and $b:A$. 

A **formal topology** or **formal space** is a [[type]] $S$ together with

*  an [[element]] $\top:S$,
*  a [[binary operation]] $\cap:S \times S \to S$,
*  a [[binary relation]] $a \lhd A$ between elements of $S$, $a:S$, and [[subtypes]] of $S$, $A:S \to \Omega$, and
*  a [[unary relation]] $\Diamond a$ on $S$,

such that

1. For all elements $a:S$ and $b:S$, the canonical function 
$$\mathrm{idToFormalTop}(a, b):(a =_S b) \to ((a \lhd \{b\}) \times (b \lhd \{a\}))$$
is an [[equivalence of types]]. 
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{b:S} \mathrm{isEquiv}(\mathrm{idToFormalTop}(a, b))$$
2. For all elements $a:S$ and subsets $A:S \to \Omega$, if $a \in_S A$, then $a \lhd A$
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{A:S \to \Omega} (a \in_S A) \to (a \lhd A)$$
3.  For all elements $a:S$ and subsets $A:S \to \Omega$ and $B:S \to \Omega$, if $a \lhd A$ and for all elements $x:S$, $x \lhd B$ and $x \in_S A$, then $a \lhd B$
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{A:S \to \Omega} \prod_{B:S \to \Omega} \left((a \lhd A) \times \prod_{x:S} (x \in_S A) \times (x \lhd B)\right) \to (a \lhd B)$$
4.  For all elements $a:S$ and $b:S$ and subsets $A:S \to \Omega$, if $a \lhd A$ or $b \lhd A$, then $a \cap b \lhd A$.
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{b:S} \prod_{A:S \to \Omega} ((a \lhd A) \times (b \lhd A)) \to (a \cap b \lhd A)$$
5.  For all elements $a:S$ and subsets $A:S \to \Omega$ and $B:S \to \Omega$, if $a \lhd A$ and $a \lhd B$, then
$$a \lhd \sum_{z:S} \prod_{x:S} \prod_{y:S} (x \in_S A) \times (y \in_S B) \times (z =_S x \cap u)$$
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{A:S \to \Omega} \prod_{B:S \to \Omega} (a \lhd A) \times (a \lhd B) \to \left(a \lhd \sum_{z:S} \prod_{x:S} \prod_{y:S} (x \in_S A) \times (y \in_S B) \times (z =_S x \cap y)\right)$$
6.  For all elements $a:S$, $a \lhd \{\top\}$,
$$\prod_{a:S} a \lhd \{\top\}$$
7.  For all elements $a:S$ and subsets $A:S \to \Omega$, if $\Diamond a$ and $a \lhd A$, there exists an element $x:S$ such that $x \in_S A$ and $\Diamond x$. 
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{A:S \to \Omega} (\Diamond a) \times (a \lhd A) \to \sum_{x:S} (x \in_S A) \times (\Diamond x)$$
8.  For all elements $a:S$ and subsets $A:S \to \Omega$, if $\Diamond a$ implies $a \lhd A$, then $a \lhd A$. 
$$\prod_{a:S} \prod_{A:S \to \Omega} (\Diamond a \to a \lhd A) \to (a \lhd A)$$

### Predicative definition

Suppose that the [[dependent type theory]] does not have a [[type of all propositions]], nor any [[type universes]]. This means that subtypes of a type $S$ do not form a type, which is necessary for defining the cover relation, which is inherently a relation between elements of $S$ and subtypes of $S$. However, one can resolve this problem by using a definition of formal topology which does not require a cover relation in its definition, and then [[inductively define]] the cover relation on $S$ as a [[higher inductive type|higher]] [[inductive family]] of [[inductive cover relations]] for every single type in $A$. 

Ayberk Tosun in [Tosun 2020](#Tosun20) defined a **formal topology** as a [[poset]] $(A, \leq)$ with families of types $x:A \vdash B(x)$, $x:A, y:B(x) \vdash C(x, y)$ and a dependent function 

$$d:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:B(x)} C(x, y) \to A$$

such that

* for all $x:A$, $y:B(x)$, and $z:C(x, y)$, $d(x, y, z) \leq x$

* for all $x:A$ and $x':A$, $x' \leq x$ implies that for all $y:B(x)$ one can construct $y':B(x')$ such that for all $z:C(x, y)$, one can construct $z':C(x', y')$ such that $d(x', y', z') \leq d(x, y, z)$. 

Then given a type $U$, the cover relation is a higher inductive type family $a \lhd_U e$ between elements $a:A$ and [[embeddings of types]] $e:U \hookrightarrow A$ generated by the constructors 

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash U \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash e:U \hookrightarrow A \quad \Gamma \vdash p:\exists x:U.e(x) =_A a}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{dir}_A(a, e, p):a \lhd_U e}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash U \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash e:U \hookrightarrow A \quad \Gamma \vdash b:B(a) \quad \Gamma \vdash f:\prod_{c:C(a, b)} d(a, b, c) \lhd_U e}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{branch}_A(a, e, b, f):a \lhd_U e}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash a:A \quad \Gamma \vdash U \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash e:U \hookrightarrow A \quad \Gamma \vdash p:a \lhd_U e \quad \Gamma \vdash q:a \lhd_U e}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{squash}_A(a, e, p, q):p =_{a \lhd_U e} q}$$
