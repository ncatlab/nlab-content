Alain Connes (born on April 1, 1947) is a French mathematician, Fields medalist (1982), Crafoord prize winner (2001), Professor at [IH&#201;S](http://www.ihes.fr), Professor at Coll&#232;ge de France and part-time working as a Professor at Vanderbilt University. His interests include [[geometry]], [[topology]], especially K-theory and [[index theory]], [[operator algebras]].

## Research

Most recently Connes is studying number theory including connections to the "thermodynamic aspect" via the [[KMS state]]s, to the absolute geometry via the [[field with one element]] and a related approach to the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. 

Alain Connes uses intuition from [[mathematical physics]] like the notion of KMS state and has introduced  the noncommutative extensions of [[standard model of particle physics]] predicting a value for the mass of [[Higgs particle]]. He proposed elements of a  unification of [[gravity]] and [[gauge theories]] via [[spectral action]] functionals on spaces of [[spectral triple]]s. 

Connes is most well known for introducing a dominant direction to  [[noncommutative geometry]] where his contributions include, most remarkably, the introduction of [[cyclic homology]] and its connections to the [[K-theory]] of spaces and of [[operator algebra]]s, study of fundamental examples of noncomutative spaces like 
the space of leaves of a foliation, noncommutative tori, groupoid operator algebras, spaces of Penrose tilings, introducing noncommutative motives into operator algebras (with [[Mathilde Marcolli]]), Baum-Connes hypothesis, local index formulas, combionatorial approach to Feynman diagrams (Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of renormalization) and analytic aspects connecting them to the Birkhoff decomposition, introducing Hopf-cyclic homology etc. 

As an inspirative and energetic lecturer Connes also directly contibuted to the popularization of noncommutative geometry and its connections to physics.
