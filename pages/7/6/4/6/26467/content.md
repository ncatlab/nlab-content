## Disambiguation

A **linear order** could refer to either 

* a [[total order]]

* a [[weakly total]] [[partial order]]

* a [[strict total order]] (i.e. [[DLO]])

* a [[pseudo-order]]

Classically, the first two are the same, but constructively, the second notion is weaker than the first. Similarly, classically, the next two are the same, but constructively, the fourth notion is weaker than the third. 

Classically, the first and third are [[complements]] of each other - and thus defining one is sufficient to defining the other, they still have different properties. In [[constructive mathematics]], only the [[decidable]] such relations are complements of each other, and in general the two relations cannot be defined from the other.
