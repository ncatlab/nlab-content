## Idea

The locally free [[sheaf|sheaves]] of rank $1$ on a [[ringed space]] form a [[group]] under the [[tensor product]].


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[ringed space]]. The **Picard group** denoted $Pic(X)$ is defined to be the set of isomorphism classes of locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of rank $1$ with group operation given by the [[tensor product]]. Note that locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of rank one are also called *invertible sheaves*.

## Pic(X) is a Group

First, if $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are elements of $Pic(X)$, then $\mathcal{L}\otimes \mathcal{M}$ is still locally free of rank $1$ as can be seen by taking intersections of the trivializing covers. So $Pic(X)$ is closed under tensor product.

There is an identity element, since $\mathcal{O}_X\otimes \mathcal{L}\simeq \mathcal{L}$. The tensor product is associative.

Lastly, given any invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ we check that $\mathcal{L}^\wedge=\mathcal{Hom}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is its inverse. Consider $\mathcal{L}^\wedge \otimes \mathcal{L}\simeq \mathcal{Hom}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{L})\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$.

## Alternate Forms

Suppose that $X$ is an integral [[scheme]] over a [[field]]. The correspondence between [[Cartier divisor]]s and invertible sheaves is given by $D\mapsto \mathcal{O}_X(D)$. If $D$ is represented by $\{(U_i, f_i)\}$, then $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is $\mathcal{O}_X$-submodule of $\mathcal{K}$, the sheaf of quotients, generated by $f_i^{-1}$ on $U_i$. Under our assumptions, this map is an isomorphism between the Cartier class divisor group and Picard group, but for a general scheme it is only injective. Under the additional assumptions that $X$ is [[separated scheme|separated]] and locally factorial, we get an isomorphism between the class divisor group and $Pic(X)$.

Another form the Picard group takes is from the isomorphism $Pic(X)\simeq H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$. The isomorphism is most easily seen by looking at the transition functions for a trivializing cover of $\mathcal{L}$. Suppose $(\phi_i)$ trivialize $\mathcal{L}$ over the cover $(U_i)$. Then $\phi_i^{-1}\circ \phi_j$ is an automorphism of $\mathcal{O}_{U_i\cap U_j}$, i.e. a section of $\mathcal{O}_X^*(U_i\cap U_j)$. One can check this defines a [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] $\check{H}^1(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$ which is isomorphic to the abelian [[sheaf cohomology]] $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$.

Title: On the Picard number of K3 surfaces over number fields
Authors: Fran&#231;ois Charles
&lt;http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1111.4117>
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of the behavior of specialization at a finite place of N&#233;ron-Severi groups of K3 surfaces over number fields. We give optimal lower bounds for the Picard number of such specializations, thus answering a question of Elsenhans and Jahnel. As a consequence of these results, we show that it is possible to explicitly compute the Picard number of any given K3 surface over a number field.
