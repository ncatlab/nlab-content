A **simplicial object** in a category $C$ is a functor $\Delta^{op} \to C$, where $\Delta$ is the [[simplex category|simplicial indexing category]].

##Remark##
 A **simplicial object** $X$ in $C$ is often specified by 
the objects, $X_n$, which are the images under $X$, of the objects $[n]$ of $\Delta$, together with a description of the face and degeneracy morphisms, $d_i$ and $s_j$, which must satisfy the [[simplicial identities]].
