[[!redirects Montague grammar]]



A formal approach to [[linguistics]] and natural language [[semantics]], due to [[Richard Montague]].
In essence, it applies [[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] principle of [[compositionality]] to natural language.

In his own words:

> There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory.

(from [Montague 70a](#Montague70a))
