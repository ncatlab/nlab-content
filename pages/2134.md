Two related basic facts in [[representation theory]] bare the name of Schur lemma: one general about the categories of modules, and another specific to the case of complex numbers. If $G$ is a group, a $G$-module is any $k$-module with an action of $G$, where $k$ is a fixed commutative unital ground ring. 

__Schur lemma__ (1) Given a group $G$ and a linear map $\phi : M\to N$ between two irreducible (= [[simple object|simple]]) $G$-modules (linear maps intertwining the actions) then $\phi$ is either $0$ or an isomorphism. 

(2) Set $M=N$, suppose further that the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$; then $\phi$ is a multiple $\lambda I$ of the identity operator. In other words, the nonscalar automorphisms of simple modules, _a priori_ possible by (1), are ruled out over complex numbers.  
  
There are versions of (2) for algebraically closed fields. Part (1) is essentially categorical and can be generalized in many ways, for example, by replacing $G$ by some $k$-algebra and taking the representations compatible with the action of $k$. Schur's lemma is one of the basic facts of the [[representation theory]].
