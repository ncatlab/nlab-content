## Idea

[[number theory]] and [[physics]]

## Examples

* [[Riemann hypothesis and physics]]

* [[Langlands duality]]

* [[p-adic physics]]

## References

The relation between [[string theory]] with its [[scattering amplitudes]] on [[Riemann surfaces]] and the theory of [[automorphic forms]] was maybe first highlighted in

  (despite the title, this is really mostly about number theory/enumerative geometry and physics)
