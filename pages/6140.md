## Idea

An __operator topology__ is an abbreviation of a __[[topology]] on a space of (continuous linear) [[linear operator|operator]]s__ between [[topological vector space]]s over a fixed [[field]] $k$ of [[real number|reals]] or [[complex number|complexes]] (possibly also p-adics, skewfield of [[quaternions]] etc.). In other words the [[hom-sets]] in the category of topological vector spaces as objects and continuous linear operators as morphisms are equipped with an operator topology.

There are many widely used topologies, some with standard names. Let $L(V,W) = Hom_{TVS}(V,W)$ be the set of continuous linear operators. 

* __weak operator topology__ on $L(V,W)$ is given by the basis of open neighborhoods of zero given by sets of the form $U(x,f) = \{A\in L(V,W) : |f(A(x)) \lt 1 \} $ where $x\in V$ and $f\in W^* = Hom_{TVS}(W,k)$. A sequence $(A_n)$ converges to $A$ is weak operator topology iff the sequence $(A_n(x))$ converges to $A(x)$ in the weak topology on $W$. We write $A_n\stackrel{w}\longrightarrow A$ or $w-lim A_n = A$. 

* __strong operator topology__: the basis of neighborhoods of zero are given by sets 
$N(x,U) = \{A\in L(V,W) \,|\, Av \in U\}$, where $v\in V$ and $U$ is a neighborhood of zero in $W$. For convergence of sequences, we write $A_n\stackrel{s}\longrightarrow A$ or $s-lim A_n= A$.

* __uniform operator topology__: here we assume that $V,W$ are normed spaces with norms $p_V$, $p_W$. Then $L(V,W)$ has a uniform operator topology induced by the norm given by the formula  

$$
p(A) = sup_{v\neq 0} \frac{p_W(Av)}{p_V (v)}
$$
