The category [[Ab]] of discrete abelian groups is (as a case of [[Pontrjagin duality]] for locally compact Hausdorff groups) [[dual|dual category]] to the category of compact Hausdorff abelian groups. 

Gabriel-Roos-Oberst duality refers to several generalizations of this duality for more general [[Grothendieck categories]] in terms of linearly compact topological rings and modules. 

In Gabriel's thesis

* [[Pierre Gabriel]], [[Des catégories abéliennes]], Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France 90 (1962), 323-448 (numdam)

the dual of any locally finite Grothendieck category has been found. Roos has
generalized this to locally noetherian Grothendieck categories in

The case of (dual of) a general Grothendieck category is found in
