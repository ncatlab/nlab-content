Theorem ([[Tohoku]]) Let $A,B,C$ be abelian categories and $F:A\to B$, $G:B\to C$ left exact additive functors. Let $R_A\subset \mathrm{Ob} A$ and $R_B\subset\mathrm{Ob} B$ be [[class of adapted objects|classes of objects adapted to]] $F$ and $G$ respectively, and let furthermore $F(R_A)\subset R_B$. Then the derived functors $RF:D^+(A)\to D^+(B)$, $RG:D^+(B)\to D^+(C)$ and $R(G\circ  F):D^+(A)\to D^+(C)$ are defined and the natural morphism $R(G\circ F)\to RG\circ RF$ is an isomorphism. 

The **Grothendieck spectral sequence** is a [[spectral sequence]] guranteed in the situation of above theorem and it has many classical spectral sequences as a special case.
