## Idea ##

The _comma category_ of two [[functors]] $f : C \to E$ and $g : D \to E$ is like an [[arrow category]] of $E$ where all arrows have their [[source]] in the image of $f$ and their [[target]] in the image of $g$ (and the morphisms between arrows keep track of how these sources and targets are in these images). It is a kind of [[2-pullback]]: a directed refinement of the [[homotopy pullback]] of two functors between groupoids.


## Definition

We discuss three equivalent definitions of comma categories

1. [Explicitly in components](#InComponents)

1. [As a fiber product](#AsAFiberProduct)

1. [As a 2-pullback](#AsA2Pullback)

###### Remark

The terminology "comma category" is a holdover from the original notation $(f,g)$ for such a category, which generalises $(x,y)$ or $C(x,y)$ for a [[hom-set]].

Another common notation for the comma category is $(f\downarrow g)$.  The original notation, from which the terminology is derived, is $(f,g)$, but this is rarely used any more.

### In components

###### Definition

If $f:C\to E$ and $g:D\to E$ are [[functors]], their **comma category** is the category $(f/g)$ whose

* [[objects]] are triples $(c,d,\alpha)$ where $c\in C$, $d\in D$, and $\alpha:f(c)\to g(d)$ is a morphism in $E$, and whose

* [[morphisms]] from $(c_1,d_1,\alpha_1)$ to $(c_2,d_2,\alpha_2)$ are pairs $(\beta,\gamma)$, where $\beta:c_1\to c_2$ and $\gamma:d_1\to d_2$ are morphisms in $C$ and $D$, respectively, such that $\alpha_2 . f(\beta) = g(\gamma) . \alpha_1$.

$$
  \array{
    f(c_1)
    &\stackrel{f(\beta)}{\to}&
    f(c_2)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\alpha_1}
    &&
    \downarrow^{\alpha_2}
    \\
    g(d_1)
    &\stackrel{g(\gamma)}{\to}&
    g(d_2)    
    \\
    \\
    (c_1,d_1, \alpha_1)
    &\stackrel{(\beta,\gamma)}{\to}&
    (c_2,d_2, \alpha_2)
  }
$$

* [[composition]] of morphisms is given on components by composition in $C$ and $D$.

### As a fiber product
 {#AsAFiberProduct}

Let $I = \{a \to b\}$ be the (directed) [[interval object|interval category]] and $E^I = Funct(I,E)$ the [[functor category]]. 

The comma category is the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    (f/g) 
    &\to&
    E^I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_0 \times d_1}}
    \\
    C \times D
    &\stackrel{f \times g}{\to}&
    E \times E
  }
$$

(in the 1-category [[Cat]] of categories).

Compare this with the construction at [[generalized universal bundle]] and with the definition of [[loop space object]]. 

### As a 2-pullback
 {#AsA2Pullback}

Alternatively, the comma category is the "lax pullback" -- or rather the [[comma object]] (see the discussion at [[2-limit]]) of the pullback diagram, 

$$
  \array{
    && C
    \\
    && \downarrow^f
    \\
    D &\stackrel{g}{\to}& E
  }
$$


i.e. the [[universal cone]] that commutes up to a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \array{
    (f/g) &\to& C
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^f
    \\
    D &\stackrel{g}{\to}& E
  }
$$

In terms of the imagery of loop spaces objects, the comma category is the category of [[interval object|directed paths]] in $E$ which start in the image of $f$ and end in the image of $g$.


## Examples 

* If $f$ and $g$ are both the identity functor of a category $C$, then $(f/g)$ is the category $C ^{\mathbf{2}} $ of arrows  in $C$.

* If $f$ is the identity functor of $C$ and $g$ is the inclusion $1\to C$ of an object $c\in C$, then $(f/g)$ is the [[over category|slice category]] $C/c$.

* Likewise if $g$ is the identity and $f$ is the inclusion of $c$, then $(f/g)$ is the [[under category|coslice category]] $c/C$.

## Properties

### 2-categorical properties 

The comma category $(f/g)$ comes with a canonical 2-cell in the square

+--{: style="text-align:center"}
[[!include comma category > 2cell]]
=--
which is universal in the [[2-category]] [[Cat]]; that is, it is an example of a [[2-limit]] (in fact, it is a [[strict 2-limit]]).  Squares with the same universal property in an arbitrary 2-category are called _comma squares_ and their top left vertex is called a [[comma object]].
