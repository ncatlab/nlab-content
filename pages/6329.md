## Idea

[[dynamics|Dynamics]] affects both [[observables]] and, [[duality between space and quantity|dually]], [[states]]; this is most well known in [[quantum mechanics]] but applies equally well to [[classical mechanics]]. The different "pictures" of mechanics differ in in how the dynamics is explicitly formalized:

* In the __Heisenberg picture__, the dependence of observables on [[time]] (or more generally [[spacetime]]) is encoded, while the state is held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by the [[Haag–Kastler axioms]] of [[AQFT]].

* In the __Schrödinger picture__, states are propagated through [[time]], while observables are held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by [[cobordism category]] [[representation]]s in [[FQFT]].

* The __[[Dirac (interaction) picture]]__ is a mixture of these two approaches: dynamics is split into a [[free system|free]] (or otherwise [[solvable system|solvable]]) part and an [[perturbation theory|interaction or perturbation]]; one of these is take to affect the states, the other the observables.

The pictures are named after those physicists ([[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and [[Paul Dirac]]) who first used or popularised these approaches to quantum physics.


## Formulation

Let us assume a global notion of [[time]], say a [[fixed background]] [[spacetime]] which admits a [[foliation]] into [[Cauchy surfaces]] and a [[time coordinate]] for this foliation.  The upshot of this is that each [[event]] occurs at a time $t$, and conversely we can speak of [[space]] at any time $t$ (at least within certain bounds).  Thus we may speak sensibly of either the state of the world at time $t$ or the value of some observable quantity at time $t$.

Because this is a picture of [[dynamics]], states or observables (as appropriate to the picture) will vary through time.  We therefore have a [[time evolution]] operator $U(t,t')$ between any two times $t,t'$; actually, we need consider only $U(t) \coloneqq U(t,0)$, since $U(t,t') = U(t) \circ U(t')^{-1}$.

In the Heisenberg picture, for each observable $A$, we speak of $A$ only at some time $t$, so our actual observables are of the form $A(t)$.  We write abstractly
$$ A(t) = A(0) \cdot U(t) $$
to show the evolution of the observable through time.  However, when it comes to the state of the world, we speak of a single state $\psi$ that describes the world at all times.

In the Schrödinger picture, we instead speak of $\psi(t)$, the state of the world at time $t$.  We write abstractly
$$ \psi(t) = U(t) \ast \psi(0) $$
(the [[Schrödinger equation]]) to show the evolution of the state through time.  However, when it comes to observables, we use only the observable $A$ across all times.

To see the connection between the two pictures, recall that an observable $A$ and a state $\psi$ together produce a [[probability distribution]] giving the probability that any given value of $A$ will be observed, given that the world is in state $\psi$.  (This is true throughout mechanics, although it is obscured in non-statistical classical mechanics, since the probability distributions produced by classical [[pure states]] are all [[delta measure]]s.)  Assuming that $A$ belongs to an appropriate [[algebra of observables]] and the probability measures are sufficiently nice, we may restrict attention to the [[expectation value]]s $\langle{A}\rangle_\psi$ of these distributions, since the entire distribution can be recovered from $\langle{A^n}\rangle_\psi$ as $n$ varies over [[natural numbers]].

The connection between the two pictures is then given by
$$ \langle{A \cdot U(t)}\rangle_\psi = \langle{A}\rangle_{U(t) \ast \psi} .$$

It remains to say exactly what $U(t)$ is and what the operations $\cdot$ and $\ast$ are.  Let us use the [[density matrix]] formulation of [[quantum statistical mechanics]], since classical and non-statistical mechanics may be recovered as special cases, by restricting (respectively) the allowed observables or states.  In this case, both states and observables are given by [[linear operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, and we have
$$ \langle{A}\rangle_\psi = \tr(A \psi) $$
(using the [[trace]] operation).
Each $U(t)$ is a [[unitary operator]] on $H$ (since time evolution between Cauchy surfaces is a symmetry), and we have
$$ A \cdot U(t) = U(t)^{-1} A U(t) $$
(a [[right action]]) and
$$ U(t) \ast \psi = U(t) \psi U(t)^{-1} $$
(a [[left action]]).
We then have
$$ \langle{A \cdot U(t)}\rangle_\psi
 = tr(U(t)^{-1} A U(t) \psi)
 = tr(A U(t) \psi U(t)^{-1})
 = \langle{A}\rangle_{U(t) \ast \psi} ,$$
as desired, using the [[cyclic property of the trace]].

The time evolution operator $U(t)$ is often derived from a [[Hamiltonian]] and the formula for $A(t)$ or $\psi(t)$ is further derived from a [[differential equation]] involving this Hamiltonian.  However, this is unnecessary for the connection between the two pictures.
