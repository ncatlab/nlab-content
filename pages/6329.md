## Idea

Dynamics in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] affects both [[observables]] and, dually, [[states]]. The different "pictures" of quantum mechanics differ in in how the dynamics is explicitly formalized:

* in the [[Schr√∂dinger picture]] states are propagated through time, while observables are held fixed;

  the axiomatic formalization of this is given by [[cobordism category]] [[representation]]s in [[FQFT]];

* in the _Heisenberg picture_ the dependence of observables on [[spacetime]] is encoded, instead;

  the axiomatic formalization of this is given by the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]s of [[AQFT]]

* the the [[Dirac interaction picture]] a mixture of these two approaches is used: dynamics is split into a free part and an interaction (see [[perturbation theory]]) and one of these is take to affect the states, the other the observables.
