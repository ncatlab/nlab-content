## Idea

The [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[generalized cohomology theory]] which is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[equivariant sphere spectrum]] may also be called _equivariant stable cohomotopy_, as it is the [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] version of [[stable cohomotopy]], hence of [[cohomotopy]].

## Properties

See at _[quaternionic Hopf fibration --  Class in equivariant stable homotopy theory](quaternionic+Hopf+fibration#ClassInEquivariantStableHomotopyTheory)_
