## Definition

A [[functor]] $F: C \to D$ is __pseudomonic__ if

1. it is [[faithful functor|faithful]]; that is, for any pair of objects $x,y\in C$ the function $F: C(x,y) \to D(F x,F y)$ is injective, and
2. it is _full on isomorphisms_, meaning that for  any pair of objects $x,y\in C$ the function $F: Iso_C(x,y) \to Iso_D(F x, F y)$ is surjective (hence bijective), where $Iso_C(x,y)$ means the set of [[isomorphism|isomorphisms]] from $x$ to $y$ in $C$.

More generally, a morphism $f:C\to D$ in any [[2-category]] $K$ is called **[[pseudomonic morphism]]** if the corresponding square is a pullback, or equivalently if $K(X,C)\to K(X,D)$ is a pseudomonic functor for any $X$.  


## Properties


Every [[full functor|full]] and faithful functor is pseudomonic, and every pseudomonic functor is [[conservative functor|conservative]].  A functor $F: C \to D$ is pseudomonic if and only if the square

$$
  \array{ 
    C &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& C
    \\
    \downarrow^{Id}
    &&
    \downarrow^F
    \\
    C &\stackrel{F}{\to}& D
  }
$$

is a [[2-limit|pullback]] in [[Cat]].

## Examples


+--{.query}
An interesting example of the notion appears in the context of Joyal's species of structures.

A species is a functor from the category $Bij$ of finite sets and bijections to $Set$, and the functors that are obtained by taking left Kan extensions of species along the embedding $I:Bij \to Set$ are called _analytic functors_. Now taking left Kan extensions along $I$ is pseudomonic, and this implies that the coefficients of an analytic functor are unique up to isomorphism.

I think that in a sense pseudomonic functors are precisely the functors for which it makes sense to say that $A$ is uniquely determined by $FA$ up to isomorphism (although we do not really need faithfulnes for this, bijectivity on isos suffices).
