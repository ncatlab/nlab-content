
Multilinear algebra studies [[multilinear map]]s and constructions.  These are usually formulated as [[linear-algebra]] constructions on [[tensor products]] (especially [[tensor powers]]) of [[vector spaces]], and their [[linear subspace|subspaces]] and [[quotient vector space|quotient spaces]] that have some symmetry with respect to a natural action of a [[symmetric group]], for example the [[exterior power|exterior]] and [[symmetric power|symmetric]] powers of vector spaces, and generalizations for [[vector bundles]], [[coherent sheaves]], etc., and also those related to constructions relating other Ferrers--[[Young tableaux]], not only symmetrizers and antisymmetrizers.

Related entries include [[Young diagram]], [[tensor algebra]], [[symmetric algebra]], [[exterior algebra]], [[Schur functor]], [[tensor]], etc.
