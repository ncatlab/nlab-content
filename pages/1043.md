[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I could start entering something here, but I don't quite feel authorized. I am hoping that maybe [[Todd Trimble|Todd]] or [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] or [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] can start giving the "good" general perspective on universal constructions.

I am hoping that, among other things, we can give a helpful overview discussion of the interrelation of the concepts

* [[adjoint functor]]

* [[limit]] 

* [[end]]

* [[Kan extension]]

In good cases every single one of these is a special case of every other, so somehow one single concept here comes to us with many different faces. There should be a good way to think of this.
