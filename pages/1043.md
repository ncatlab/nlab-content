The __universal constructions__ in [[category theory]] include

* [[representable functor]]

* [[adjoint functor]]

* [[limit]]/[[colimit]]

* [[end]]/[[coend]]

* [[Kan extension]]

Each of these may be defined by requiring it to satisfy a __universal property__.

In good cases, every single one of these is a special case of every other, so somehow one single concept here comes to us with many different faces. 

Some or all of these have analogs in [[higher category theory]], notably in [[(∞,1)-category theory]]:

* [[limit in a quasi-category]]

* [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]
