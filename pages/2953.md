In a concrete category, an **injective hull** of an object $A$ is an extension $A \stackrel{m}{\longrightarrow} B$ of $A$ such that $B$ is [[injective]] and $m$ is [[essential embedding|essential]].

Examples 

* In [[Vect]] every object $A$ has an injective hull, $A \stackrel{id_A}{\longrightarrow} A$.
* In [[Pos]] every object has an injective hull, its [[MacNeille completion]].
* In [[Ab]] every object has an injective hull. The embedding $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ is an example.
* In the category of fields and algebraic field extensions, every object has an injective hull, its [[algebraic closure]].
