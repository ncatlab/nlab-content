## Idea and a bit of history

The aim of much of [[homotopy theory]] in the 1930s and 1940s was to try to lay _combinatorial_ foundations for determining whether two [[topological spaces]] were of the same [[homotopy type]] and, if so, was it possible to build up the homotopy equivalences in some simple way.  The model for this idea came, it seems, from [[Tietze transformation|Tietze's theorem]] in the theory of group presentations, where any presentation of a group could be deformed into any other by a series of 'moves'.  The same process was apparent in the development of the classification theorem for surfaces.  The question thus was: could one find some simple set of 'moves' that would generate all the homotopy equivalences with a given domain, $X$?

The theory was initially developed by Reidemeister, and then [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead]], culminating in his 1950 paper _Simple homotopy types_.  The theory received a further stimulus with [[John Milnor|Milnor]]'s classic paper in 1966 in which emphasis was put on [[elementary expansion]]s.

Further interesting approaches were developed by [[Eckmann]] and [[Siebenmann]] in 1970 (see references).
