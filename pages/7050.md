##Idea and a bit of history##

The aim of much of homotopy theory in the 1930s and 1940s was to try to lay _combinatorial_ foundations for determining whether two spaces were of the same homotopy type and, if so, was it possible to build up the homotopy equivalences in some simple way.  The model for this idea came, it seems, from [[Tietze transformation|Tietze's theorem]] in the theory of group presentations, where any presentation of a group could be deformed into any other by a series of 'moves'.  The same process was apparent in the development of the classification theorem for surfaces.  The question thus was: could on find some simple set of 'moves' that would generate all the homotopy equivalences with a given domain, $X$.

The theory was initially developed by Reidemeister, and then [[Henry Whitehead|Whitehead]], culminating in his 1950 paper _Simple homotopy types_.  The theory received a further stimulus with [[John Milnor|Milnor]]'s classic paper in 1966 in which emphasis was put on elementary expansions.
