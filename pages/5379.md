##Homotopy Types




This 72 page article, by [[Hans Baues]], is to be found in the [[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]. It starts from a basic position and attacks three main topics:

* Homotopy types with non-trivial fundamental group (Sections 2 - 5);

* Homotopy types with trivial fundamental group (Sections 6 - 9, 12);

* Stable homotopy types (Sections 10 and 11).
