For a [[category]] $C$ and [[endofunctor]] $F$, an __algebra__ of $F$ is an object $X$ in $C$ and a map $\alpha: F(X) \to X$.

The dual concept is a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]].

If the endofunctor $F$ has the structure of a [[monad]], then an algebra (aka module) over that monad is an algebra for $F$ that satisfies an additional associativity property. For more details see [[algebra over a monad]].

An [[initial object]] in the category of algebras for $F$ is an [[initial algebra]] of $F$.
