## Idea

An _algebra over an endofunctor_ is like an [[algebra over a monad]], but without a notion of [[associativity]] (which would not make sense).


## Definition

For a [[category]] $C$ and [[endofunctor]] $F$, an __algebra__ (or __module__) of $F$ is an [[object]] $X$ in $C$ and a [[morphism]] $\alpha\colon F(X) \to X$. ($X$ is called the __carrier__ of the algebra)

A [[homomorphism]] between two algebras $(X, \alpha)$ and $(Y, \beta)$ of $F$ is a morphism $m\colon X \to Y$ in $C$ such that the following [[commuting diagram|square commutes]]:

$$ 
  \array{ 
    F(X) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(m)}{\rightarrow} 
    & 
    F(Y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \beta 
    \\ X 
    & 
    \stackrel{m}{\rightarrow} & Y 
  }
  \,. 
$$

[[composition|Composition]] of such morphisms of algebras is given by composition of the underlying morphisms in $C$.

The dual concept is a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]]. Both algebras and coalgebras for endofunctors on $C$ are special cases of [[algebra for a C-C bimodule|algebras for bimodules]].


## Properties

### Relation to algebras over a monad

If an [[algebra for a monad]] is like an [[action]] of a [[monoid]], then an algebra for a functor is like a [[binary function]] (an action of a [[set]]).

This can be made quite precise.  It\'s immediate that a function $A \times B \to B$ is the same thing as an action of the [[free monoid]] $A^*$ on $B$.  Similarly, an algebra for the functor $F$ is the same thing as an algebra for the [[free monad]] of $F$.

###### Proposition

The [[category]] of algebras of the endofunctor $F\colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] of the [[free monad]] on $F$.

The proof is fairly straightforward, see for instance ([Maciej](#Maciej)).
