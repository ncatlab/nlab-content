#Idea#

One expects a notion of volume measure on [[Lie groupoid]]s (also known as [[differentiable stack]]s), which generalizes the notion of [[groupoid cardinality]] of finite groupoids in that it reduces the volume of the object space by the degree to which [[automorphism]]s encode [[homological resolution|weak quotient]]s.

A solution to this was proposed by Alan Weinstein, and re-interpreted in terms of 2-vector bundles by Richard Hepworth. 

One would expect some relation of this to the [[BV theory|Lagrangian BV formalism]], which is also a formalism for integration over $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s.
