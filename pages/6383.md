## Definition

A [[group]] $G$ is called **divisible** if for every [[integer]] $n$ we have that for every element $g \in G$ there is an element $h \in G$ such that

$$
  g = n \times h := (h \cdot h \cdot \cdots \cdot h)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have $n$ factors.

For $p$ a [[prime number]] an [[abelian group]] is **$p$-divisible** if the above formula holds for all $n = p^k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Examples

* The underlying abelian group of any [[vector space]] over the [[rational number]]s $\mathbb{Q}$ is divisible.
