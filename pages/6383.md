## Definition

A [[group]] $G$ (written additively, often assumed [[abelian group|abelian]]) is called **divisible** if for every [[integer]] $n$ we have that for every element $g \in G$ there is an element $h \in G$ such that

$$
  g = n \times h \coloneqq (h + h + \cdots + h)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have $n$ summands.

For $p$ a [[prime number]] a group is **$p$-divisible** if the above formula holds for all $n$ of the form $p^k$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$.  (There is also an abstract notion of $p$-[[p-divisible group|divisible group]] in terms of [[group schemes]].)


## Examples

* The rationals $\mathbb{Q}$ and (more generally) the underlying abelian group of any $\mathbb{Q}$-[[vector space]] are divisible.
