## Definition

A [[group]] $G$ (written additively, often assumed [[abelian group|abelian]]) is called **divisible** if for every [[integer]] $n$ we have that for every element $g \in G$ there is an element $h \in G$ such that

$$
  g = n \times h \coloneqq (h + h + \cdots + h)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have $n$ summands.

For $p$ a [[prime number]] a group is **$p$-divisible** if the above formula holds for all $n$ of the form $p^k$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$.


## Examples

* The underlying abelian group of any [[vector space]] over the [[rational number]]s $\mathbb{Q}$ is divisible.
