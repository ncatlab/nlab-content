### Abelian theory

The abelian 7d [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]] was considered in

and argued to be the [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] to the [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of an abelian 2-form connection on a _single_ [[M5-brane]] in its [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] on the worldvolume.

The precise formulation of this functional in terms of [[differential cohomology]] and [[integral Wu structure]] was given in

### On $G_2$-manifolds

The Chern-Simons type action functionals $A \mapsto \int_X CS(A) \wedge \omega_4$ on a 7d [[G2-manifold]] $(X, \omega_3)$ was first considered in

this is put into the context of [[topological M-theory]] (see around equation (2) in the introduction).

In 

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:7d Chern-Simons theory and the 5-brane]]_

the 7d Chern-Simons action obtained by [[Kaluza-Klein reduction|compactifying]] [[11-dimensional supergravity]] including the quantum corrections of the [[supergravity C-field]] on a 4-sphere (the [[AdS-CFT|AdS7/CFT6]] setup) is considered and refined to an [[extended Lagrangian]]. It contains the [Donaldson-Thomas](#DonaldsonThomas)-functional $\int_X CS(A) \wedge G_4$ as one summand and the [Witten](#WittenI)-functional as another.

Further discussion of [[extended Lagrangians]] for 7d CS theories is in
