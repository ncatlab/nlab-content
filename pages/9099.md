## Idea

The case of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in [[dimension]] 7.

## Examples

We discuss

1. [Abelian 7d CS theory](#AbelianTheory) of an abelian 3-form connection;

1. [7d p2 theory on String 2-connections](#OnString2Connections)

1. [2-species cup-product theory on a G2 manifold](#TwoSpeciesCupProductTheoryOnG2Manifold)

### Abelian theory
 {#AbelianTheory}

A basic 7d [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] is the abelian theory, whose [[extended Lagrangian]] $\mathbf{L}$ is the [[diagonal]] of the [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology]] 

$$
  \mathbf{L}_{\mathbf{DD}\cup \mathbf{DD}}
  \colon
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\Delta}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \times
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\widehat {\cup}}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

The [[transgression]] of this to [[codimension]] 0 hence for $\Sigma_7$ a [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 7 is the [[action functional]]

$$
  \exp\left(  
    2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_7}
    [\Sigma_7, \mathbf{L}_{\mathbf{DD}\cup \mathbf{DD}}]
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma_7, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}]
  \to 
  U(1)
  \,.
$$

A [[gauge field]] configuration 

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \Sigma_7 \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
$$

here is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]]. In the special case that the underlying [[circle 3-group]] [[principal 3-bundle]] is trivializable and trivialized, this is equivalently a [[differential 3-form]] $C \in \Omega^3(\Sigma_7)$ and the above [[action functional]] takes this to the simple expression

$$
  C 
   \mapsto 
  \exp\left(
     2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_7}  C \wedge d C
  \right)
  \in U(1)
  \,,
$$

where in the [[exponent]] we have the [[integration of differential forms]] over the [[wedge product]] of $C$ with its [[de Rham differential]]. On general field configurations the action functional is the suitable globalization of this expression.


In ([Witten 96](#WittenI)), ([Witten 98](#Witten)) a slight refinement of this construction (a  [[quadratic refinement]] induced by an [[integral Wu structure]]) was argued to be the [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] to the [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of the abelian self-dual 2-form gauge field in the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of the [[M5-brane]]. The issue of the quadratic refinement was discussed in more detail in ([HopkinsSinger](#HopkinsSinger)). A refinement to [[extended Lagrangians]] as above is discussed in ([FSSII](#FSSII)).

By the argument in ([Witten98](#Witten98)) the above relation holds when we interpret the fields $\phi \colon : \Sigma_7 \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}$ as the [[supergravity C-field]] after [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] on a 4-[[sphere]] in the [[AdS-CFT|AdS7-CFT6]] setup. By the discussion at [[11-dimensional supergravity]] this field is in general not simply a 3-connection as above but receives corrections by a [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] and "flux quantization" which give it non-abelian components. This, and the resulting non-abelian generalization of the above extended Lagrangian is discussed in ([FSSI](#FSSI), [FSSII](#FSSII)).

The nonabelian 7d action functional this obtained contains the following two examples as summands.

### Nonabelain $p_2$ theory on String 2-connections 
 {#OnString2Connections}

The [[second fractional Pontryagin class]] 

$$
  [\tfrac{1}{6}p_2] \in H^8(B String, \mathbb{Z})
$$
 
has a smooth and differential refinement (see at _[[twisted differential fivebrane structure]]_) to an [[extended Lagrangian]]

$$
  \tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_2
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}String_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

where the domain is the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli infinity-stack|moduli 2-stack]] of [[String 2-group]] [[connection on a 2-bundle|principal 2-connections]] (see at _[[differential string structure]]_ for more). This modulates the [[Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle]] with connection on $\mathbf{B}String_{conn}$.

The [[transgression]] of this to codimension 0 yields an [[action functional]]

$$
  \exp\left(
    2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_7}
    [\Sigma_7, \tfrac{1}{6}\hat \mathbf{p}_2]
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma_7, \mathbf{B}String_{conn}]
  \to 
  U(1)
$$

on string 2-connection fields. This is part of the quantum-corrected and flux-quantized extended action functional of the [[supergravity C-field]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] by the analysis in ([FSSII](#FSSII)).



### Two-species cup-product theory on a $G_2$ manifold
 {#TwoSpeciesCupProductTheoryOnG2Manifold}

For $X$ a [[G2-manifold]] with characteristic [[differential forms]] 

$$
  \omega_3 \in \Omega^3(X)
$$ 

and 

$$
  \omega_4 = \star \omega_3\in \Omega^4(X)
$$

and for $G$ a simply connected compact [[semisimple Lie group]] with [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle -,-\rangle$, consider the [[action functional]] on the space of $\mathfrak{g}$-[[Lie algebra valued 1-forms]] $A$ given by the [[integration of differential forms]]

$$
  A 
    \mapsto 
  \exp\left(
    2 \pi i\int_{X} \omega_4 \wedge CS\left(A\right)
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $CS(A) \in \Omega^3(X)$ is the [[Chern-Simons form]] of $A$. This, or some suitable globalization of this, has been considered as an [[action functional]] for 7-dimensional Chern-Simons-type theory in ([Donaldson-Thomas](#DonaldsonThomas)) and ([Baulieu-Losev-Nekrasov](#BaulieuLosevNekrasov)). This appears as an action functional in [[topological M-theory]] ([deBoer et al](#deBoerEtAl)).

To refine this to an [[extended Lagrangian]] and then fully globalize the action functional we can ask for a [[higher geometric quantization|higher geometric prequantization]] of $\omega_4$, regarded as a [[n-plectic structure]], by a [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum 3-bundle]] $\hat \mathbf{G}_2$

$$
  \array{
   && \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{\mathrm{conn}}
   \\
   & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \mathbf{G}_2}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{(-)}}}
   \\
    X
   &\stackrel{\omega_4}{\to}&
   \Omega^4_{cl}
  }
  \,,
$$ 

where $\mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn} \in $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] is the smooth [[moduli ∞-stack]] of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]]. 

If moreover we write

$$
  \hat \mathbf{c} \;:\;
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn} 
$$

for the universal differential characteristic map which is the [[Lie integration]] of $\langle-,-\rangle$ (as discussed at _[[differential string structure]]_), hence the [[extended Lagrangian]] for ordinary [[3d Chern-Simons theory|3d]] $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]], then an [[extended Lagrangian]] for the above [[action functional]] is given by the [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology]]

$$
  X 
  \times
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \stackrel{(\hat \mathbf{G}_2, \hat \mathbf{c})}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \times
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\hat \cup}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

(This is an cup product extended Lagrangian of the kind considered in ([FSSIII](#FSSIII)).)

Notice that if we let $\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7)$ be a [[higher geometric quantization|higher geometric prequantization]] of the [[Hodge dual]] $\omega_4^0 : \mathbb{R}^7 \to \Omega^4_{cl}$ of the [[associative 3-form]] on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^7$, hence a lift in

$$
  \array{ 
    && \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7)}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{(-)}}}
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^7 &\stackrel{\omega_4^0}{\to}& \Omega^4_{cl}
  }
  \,,
$$

and if we write 

$$
  \mathbf{Heis}(\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7))
  \subset
  \mathbf{QuantMorph}(\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7))
  \in 
  Grpd(Smooth\infty Grpd)
$$

for the corresponding [[Heisenberg ∞-group]] (the sub-[[∞-group]] of the [[quantomorphism ∞-group]] on the transformation that covers [[Hamiltonian n-plectomorphisms]] which are [[linear maps]]]), hence so that the canonical extension map is

$$
  \mathbf{Heis}(\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7))
  \to 
  G_2
  \to 
  O(7)
  \,,
$$

then a [[higher geometric quantization|higher prequantization]] of $\omega_4 \in \Omega^4_{cl}$ is equivalently a [[lift of the structure group]] $\hat \tau_X$ of the [[tangent bundle]] $\tau_X$ through this [[∞-group extension]]

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Heis}(\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7))
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \tau_X}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X 
    &\stackrel{\tau_X}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}GL(7)
  }
  \,.
$$

In fact, such a lift is _in particural_ a [[G2-manifold]] structure on $X$: the intermediate lift 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}G_2
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\tilde \tau_X}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X 
    &\stackrel{\tau_X}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}GL(7)
  }
$$

is a [[G2-structure]] and then the further lift

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Heis}(\hat \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbb{R}^7))
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \tau_X}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X 
    &\stackrel{\tilde\tau_X}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}G_2
  }
$$

in imposes a [[higher geometric quantization|higher prequantization]] of the form $\omega_4 \in \Omega^4(X)$ this defined, which _in particular_ says that $\omega_4$ is closed, hence defines an "integral $G_2$-structure", hence a [[G2-manifold]] structure.

Finally notice that the prequantization lift to [[differential cohomology]] is entirely demanded by the interpretation of $\omega_4$ as the curvature of the [[supergravity C-field]] in interpretations of this setup in [[topological M-theory]] or generally the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] on a 4-[[sphere]] down to $X$.
