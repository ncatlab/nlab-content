## Idea

The case of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in [[dimension]] 7.

## Examples

### Abelian theory

A basic 7d [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] is the abelian theory, whose [[extended Lagrangian]] $\mathbf{L}$ is the [[diagonal]] of the [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology]] 

$$
  \mathbf{L}_{\mathbf{DD}\cup \mathbf{DD}}
  \colon
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\Delta}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \times
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\widehat {\cup}}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

The [[transgression]] of this to [[codimension]] 0 hence for $\Sigma_7$ a [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 7 is the [[action functional]]

$$
  \exp\left(  
    2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_7}
    [\Sigma_7, \mathbf{L}_{\mathbf{DD}\cup \mathbf{DD}}]
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma_7, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}]
  \to 
  U(1)
  \,.
$$

A [[gauge field]] configuration 

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \Sigma_7 \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
$$

here is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]]. In the special case that the underlying [[circle 3-group]] [[principal 3-bundle]] is trivializable and trivialized, this is equivalently a [[differential 3-form]] $C \in \Omega^3(\Sigma_7)$ and the above [[action functional]] takes this to the simple explression

$$
  C \mapsto \exp\left(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_7}  C \wedge d C\right)
  \in U(1)
  \,,
$$

where in the [[exponent]] we have the [[integration of differential forms]] over the [[wedge product]] of $C$ with its [[de Rham differential]]. On general field configurations the action functional is the suitable globalization of this expression.


In ([Witten 96](#WittenI)), ([Witten 98](#Witten)) a slight refinement of this construction (a  [[quadratic refinement]] induced by an [[integral Wu structure]]) was argued to be the [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] to the [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of the abelian self-dual 2-form gauge field in the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of the [[M5-brane]]. The issue of the quadratic refinement was discussed in more detail in ([HopkinsSinger](#HopkinsSinger)). A refinement to [[extended Lagrangians]] as above is discussed in ([FSSII](#FSSII)).

By the argument in ([Witten98](#Witten98)) the above relation holds when we interpret the fields $\phi \colon : \Sigma_7 \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}$ as the [[supergravity C-field]] after [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] on a 4-[[sphere]] in the [[AdS-CFT|AdS7-CFT6]] setup. By the discussion at [[11-dimensional supergravity]] this field is in general not simply a 3-connection as above but receives corrections by a [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] and "flux quantization" which give it non-abelian components. This, and the resulting non-abelian generalization of the above extended Lagrangian is discussed in ([FSSI](#FSSI), [FSSII](#FSSII)).

The nonabelian 7d action functional this obtained contains the following two examples as summands.

### Nonabelain $p_2$ theory on String 2-connections 

The [[second fractional Pontryagin class]] 

$$
  [\tfrac{1}{6}p_2] \in H^8(B String, \mathbb{Z})
$$
 
has a smooth and differential refinement (see at _[[twisted differential fivebrane structure]]_) to an [[extended Lagrangian]]

$$
  \tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_2
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}String_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

where the domain is the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli infinity-stack|moduli 2-stack]] of [[String 2-group]] [[connection on a 2-bundle|principal 2-connections]] (see at _[[differential string structure]]_ for more).

The [[transgression]] of this to codimension 0 yields an [[action functional]]

$$
  \exp\left(
    2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_7}
    [\Sigma_7, \tfrac{1}{6}\hat \mathbf{p}_2]
  \right)
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma_7, \mathbf{B}String_{conn}]
  \to 
  U(1)
$$

on string 2-connection fields. This is part of the quantum-corrected and flux-quantized extended action functional of the [[supergravity C-field]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] by the analysis in ([FSSII](#FSSII)).
