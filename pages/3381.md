## Idea

A __permutation__ is an [[automorphism]] in [[Set]].  More explicitly, a __permutation__ of a [[set]] $X$ is an [[inverse|invertible]] [[function]] from $X$ to itself.


## Definition

The [[group]] of permutations of $X$ (that is the [[automorphism group]] of $X$ in $Set$) is the __symmetric group__ (or __permutation group__) on $X$ (a [[finite group]]).  This group may be denoted $S_X$, $\Sigma_X$, or $X!$.  When $X$ is [[the]] [[finite set]] $[n]$ with $n$ elements, one typically writes $S_n$ or $\Sigma_n$; note that this group has $n!$ elements.

In [[combinatorics]], one often wants a slight generalisation.  Given a [[natural number]] $r$, an __$r$-permutation__ from $X$ is an [[injective function]] from $[r]$ to $X$, that is a [[list]] of $r$ distinct elements of $X$.  Then an $n$-permutation from $[n]$ is the same as a permutation of $[n]$.  (That an injective function from $X$ to itself must be invertible characterises $X$ as a [[Dedekind-finite set]].)


## Concrete representations 

### Via string diagrams 

### Via cycle decompositions 

## Properties

### Relation to the field with one element

One may regard the symmetric group $S_n$ as the [[general linear group]] in dimension $n$ on the [[field with one element]]  $GL(n,\mathbb{F}_1)$.

## Examples

* The symmetric group on 4 elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the full [[tetrahedral group]] as well as to the orientation-preserving [[octahedral group]].
