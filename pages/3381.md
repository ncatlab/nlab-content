## Idea

A __permutation__ is an [[automorphism]] in [[Set]].  More explicitly, a __permutation__ of a [[set]] $X$ is an [[inverse|invertible]] [[function]] from $X$ to itself.


## Definition

The [[group]] of permutations of $X$ (that is the [[automorphism group]] of $X$ in $Set$) is the __symmetric group__ (or __permutation group__) on $X$ (a [[finite group]]).  This group may be denoted $S_X$, $\Sigma_X$, or $X!$.  When $X$ is [[the]] [[finite set]] $[n]$ with $n$ elements, one typically writes $S_n$ or $\Sigma_n$; note that this group has $n!$ elements.

In [[combinatorics]], one often wants a slight generalisation.  Given a [[natural number]] $r$, an __$r$-permutation__ of $X$ is an [[injective function]] from $[r]$ to $X$, that is a [[list]] of $r$ distinct elements of $X$.  Note that the number of $r$-permutations of $[n]$ is counted by the [[falling factorial]] $n(n-1)\dots(n-r+1)$.  Then an $n$-permutation of $[n]$ is the same as a permutation of $[n]$, and the total number of such permutations is of course counted by the ordinary factorial $n!$.  (That an injective function from $X$ to itself must be invertible characterises $X$ as a [[Dedekind-finite set]].)


## Concrete representations 

### Via string diagrams 

### Via cycle decompositions 

Every permutation $\pi : X \to X$ generates a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] $\langle \pi \rangle$ of the symmetric group $S_X$, and hence inherits a [[group action]] on $X$.  The [[orbits]] of this action partition the set $X$ into a disjoint union of cycles, called the **cyclic decomposition** of the permutation $\pi$.

For example, let $\pi$ be the permutation on $[6]$ defined by

$$\pi = \array{0 \mapsto 0 \\ 1 \mapsto 3 \\ 2 \mapsto 4 \\ 3 \mapsto 5 \\ 4 \mapsto 2 \\ 5 \mapsto 1}$$

The set $[6] = \{0,\dots,5\}$ is partitioned into three $\langle\pi\rangle$-orbits 

$$[6] = \{0\} \cup \{1,3,5\} \cup \{2,4\}$$

corresponding to the three cycles

$$0 \underset{\pi}{\to} 0 \qquad
1 \underset{\pi}{\to} 3 \underset{\pi}{\to} 5 \underset{\pi}{\to} 1 \qquad
2 \underset{\pi}{\to} 4 \underset{\pi}{\to} 2$$

Finally, we can express this more compactly by writing $\pi$ in cycle form, as the product $\pi = (0)(1\,3\,5)(2\,4)$.

## Properties

### Relation to the field with one element

One may regard the symmetric group $S_n$ as the [[general linear group]] in dimension $n$ on the [[field with one element]]  $GL(n,\mathbb{F}_1)$.

## Examples

* The symmetric group on 4 elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the full [[tetrahedral group]] as well as to the orientation-preserving [[octahedral group]].
