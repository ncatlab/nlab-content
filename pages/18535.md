## Idea

The concept of _derivative of a [[distribution]]_ is the generalization of the concept of [[derivative]] of a [[smooth function]] with distributions thought of as [[generalized functions]]. The concept is uniquely fixed by enforcing the formula for [[integration by parts]] to extend from [[integrals]] against [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[densities]] to distributions.

## Definition

Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open subset]] of [[Euclidean space]] of [[dimension]] $n$. For $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n$ a multi-index, write

$$
  \partial_\alpha \coloneqq \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{\partial^{\alpha_1} x^{1}}
  \cdots
  \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{\partial^{\alpha_n} x^{n}}
$$

for the corresponding operation of [[differentiation]] and write

$$
  {\vert \alpha \vert}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum} \alpha_i
$$

for the total degree.

For $u \in \mathcal{D}'(X)$ then its [[derivative]] $\partial_\alpha u \in \mathcal{D}'(X)$ of order $\alpha$ is defined by

$$
  \langle 
    \partial_\alpha u, b
  \rangle 
  \;=\;
  (-1)^{\vert \alpha \vert} \langle u, \partial_\alpha b\rangle
$$

for any [[bump function]] $b$, where $\partial_\alpha b$ is the ordinary [[derivative]] of [[smooth functions]].

###### Example

Every [[point-supported distribution]] $u$ with $supp(u) = \{p\}$ is a [[finite set|finite]] [[sum]] of multiplies of derivatives of the [[delta distribution]] at that point:

$$
  u = 
  \underset{ {\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n} \atop { {\vert \alpha\vert} \leq k } }{\sum}  c^\alpha \partial_\alpha \delta(p)
$$

where $\{c^\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\}_\alpha$,
and for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[order of a distribution|order]] of $u$.
