## Idea

The __amplituhedron__ is a geometric body in the positive Grassmanian (which is an infinite dimensional space related to the study of the phenomenon of [[total positivity]]) which appears in a formulation of a specific QFT, namely the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. This is related to the methods related to the study of motivic content in the amplitudes related to Feynman diagrams; however this eventually lead to nonperturbative calculations.
