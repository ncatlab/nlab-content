## Idea

The [[scattering amplitudes]] in [[Yang-Mills theory]] are traditionally expressed as sums of tendentially very many [[Feynman diagrams]], which in turn are [[integrals]] over certain [[algebraic functions]]. At least in  highly [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] versions of [[Yang-Mills theory]] such as [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] this can be expressed more efficiently (see [Dixon 13](#Dixon13) for a review of the general method and see at _[[string theory results applied elsewhere]]_) as fewer [[integrals]] of some integrand over some [[domain]] of certain convex [[polyhedra]] inside a [[positive Grassmanian]] (which is an infinite dimensional space related to the study of the phenomenon of [[total positivity]]). Therefore this has been called the _amplituhedron_ ([Arkani-Hamed & Trnka13](#ArkaniHameTrnka13)).

In slightly more detail, the scattering amplitudes in [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] can be given as functions of  $4n$ real variables, the [[momenta]] of $n$ scattering [[particles]], and at loop number $\ell$ they are given by $4 \ell$-fold integrals of [[algebraic functions]] of $4n+4 \ell$ real variables. (When $\ell=0$, then ([ABCGPT 12, sections 16.4](#ABCGPT12)) claims that all the [[Galois conjugates]] of the [[algebraic function]] occur symmetrically; so that one indeed has [[rational functions]].)

This formulation is typically a drastic improvement of computational complexity for fixed $k$ ([[helicity]]) and fixed $\ell$ (loop number) but variable $n$. The [[Feynman diagram]] description is exponential in $n$, while the complexity of the amplituhedron description grows much more mildly.

In particular for $k = 0$ and $k = 1$ the resulting amplitude is just 0 and the amplituhedron description gives this immediately, but for $k = 1$ there are still many nontrivial Feynman integrals. That the sum of all these indeed vanish was maybe known earlier, though, due to a result by Parke and Taylor.

For $k = 2$ again there is the "[[Parke-Taylor formula]]" efficiently expressing the amplitudes [[MHV amplitudes]].
