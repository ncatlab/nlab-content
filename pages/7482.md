##Idea

The generalisation of [[ordered pair]] to something having more positions is usually called a *tuple*. More particularly one gets the term _$n$-tuple_, which refers to a list,
$(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$,  with $n$ entries from some set, $X$.  It thus corresponds to an element in the $n$-fold product set, $X^n$. The various elements $x_i$ of the $n$-tuple are usually called its **components** and sometimes it is useful to call the set of components the **support** of the tuple.

The discussion at [[ordered pairs]] on the formalisation of that concept generalises without difficulty to that of an $n$-tuple.
