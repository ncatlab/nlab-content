## Idea

A __hypercomplex number system__ is a [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[nonassociative algebra|algebra]] over the [[field]] $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]].  A __hypercomplex number__ is an [[element]] of one of these algebras.


## Examples by dimension

*  There is [[the|only one]] hypercomplex number system of [[dimension]] $0$, of course.

*  There is also only one hypercomplex number system of dimension $1$, which is $\mathbb{R}$ itself.

*  Up to [[isomorphism]], there are three hypercomplex number systems of dimension $2$, each of which is a [[commutative algebra]].  Since they each have one nontrivial [[automorphism]] (an [[involution]] called _conjugation_), there are only $3/2$ of these algebras by [[groupoid cardinality]].  Given the rule
   $$ e^2 = a + b e $$
   (for $a, b$ fixed real numbers), the algebra $\mathbb{R}[e]$ may be identified as one of these three cases by the sign of $b^2 - 4 a$.  They are:
   *  the [[complex numbers]] (elliptic case, $b^2 - 4 a \gt 0$),
   *  the [[dual numbers]] (parabolic case, $b^2 - 4 a = 0$),
   *  the [[perplex numbers]] (hyperbolic case, $b^2 - 4 a \lt 0$).

*  Famous hypercomplex number systems of dimension $4$ include the [[quaternion]]s and the [[bicomplex number]]s.

*  In dimension $8$, try the [[octonion]]s and the [[biquaternion]]s.

*  In dimension $16$, try the [[sedenion]]s and the [[bioctonion]]s.

Of course, these are not the only possibilities by any means.  One can always form the [[direct product]] of two hypercomplex number systems to get a hypercomplex number systems with the sum of the dimensions.  Another way to double the dimension is to form the [[tensor product]] with any of the hypercomplex number systems of dimension $2$; in particular, [[complexification]] (the tensor product with the complex numbers) is often denoted by the prefix 'bi&#8209;'.  The [[Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction]] will double the dimension of any hypercomplex number system equipped with a (possibly trivial) involution.  Another way to generate associative hypercomplex number systems is through [[Clifford algebra]]s.

There is a thorough list of examples on [the English Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hypercomplex_number).
