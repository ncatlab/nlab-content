In  order  to  establish  an  Alexander  duality  theorem  for  
compact  subsets  of $S^n$, [[Steenrod]]  introduced  in  1940  a  new  type  of  
homology  of metric compacta; a summary of the construction is given in the entry, [[Steenrod homology]]. The same problem led K. A. Sitnikov in  1951 to 
an equivalent  theory and in  1960 [[J. Milnor]] gave an axiomatic  characterization  of  the reulting  'Steenrod-Sitnikov  homology'.  

Several authors extended this to compact Hausdorff spaces and then Lisica and  [[Mardesic]] gave a definition for arbitrary spaces.
