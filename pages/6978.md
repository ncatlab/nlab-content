## Definition

A **locally cartesian closed functor** is a [[functor]] between [[locally cartesian closed categories]] that preserves the locally cartesian closed structure up to coherent [[isomorphism]].

## Examples

* Every [[logical functor]] between [[toposes]] is locally cartesian closed.
* Every [[locally connected geometric morphism]] is locally cartesian closed. ([[Elephant]] C3.3.1)
