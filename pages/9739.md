## Idea

At the _International Congress of Mathematics_ in the year 1900 in Paris, [[David Hilbert]] gave a talk in which he stated 23 open problems that he regarded central for the development of mathematics. These became famous as _Hilbert's 23 problems_ and have indeed considerably influenced mathematics 
in the 20th century.

## List of problems

* [[Hilbert's third problem]]

* [[Hilbert's fifth problem]]

* [[Hilbert's sixth problem]]

* [[Hilbert's 15th problem]]

* [[Hilbert's 21st problem]]

## Related concepts
