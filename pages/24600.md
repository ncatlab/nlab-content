## Idea

Path types are an alternative to [[identity types]] in [[dependent type theory]]. They are primarily used in [[cubical type theories]]. 

A major difference between path types and identity types is the behaviour of the J rule. In [[identity types]] the J rule holds up to definitional equality, but for path types, the J rule only holds up to a path. 

Another difference is that [[transport]] behaves better with path types, holding up to definitional equality for path types but only up to an identification for [[identity types]].
