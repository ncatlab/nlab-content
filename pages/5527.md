## Idea


The [[spectral sequence]] of a [[filtered object|filtered]] [[chain complex]] 

$$
  \cdots 
    \hookrightarrow
   F_{p-1}C_\bullet 
     \hookrightarrow 
   F_p C_\bullet 
     \hookrightarrow  
   \cdots 
     \hookrightarrow 
  C_\bullet
$$

is a tool for computing the [[chain homology]] of $C_\bullet$ from the chain homologies of the [[associated graded objects]] 

$$
  G_p C \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet/F_{p-1}C_\bullet
  \,;
$$

which is in general simpler. 

The sequence asymptotes to the homology of $C_\bullet$ by approximating [[cycles]] and [[boundaries]] of $C$ by their "$r$-approximation": an _$r$-approximate cycle_ is a [[chain]] in filtering degree $p$ whose [[differential]] vanishes only up to terms that are $r$ steps lower in filtering degree, and an $r$-approximate boundary in filtering degree $p$ is a cycle that is the differential of a chain which may be (only) up to $r$-degrees higher in filtering degree. The corresponding $r$-approximate homology of $C_\bullet$ in filtering degree $p$ is the term $E^r_{p,\bullet}$ of the spectral sequence.

Clearly, if the filtering is bounded then $\infty$-approximate homology is the correct homology, and so the spectral sequence converges to the correct homology. But the point is that typically it reaches the correct value already at some low finite degree $r$ (it "collapses"), and so allows one to obtain the genuine homology from some finite $r$-approximate homology.


One may also regard the spectral sequence of a filtered complex as a tool for organizing data derivable from the families of [[long exact sequence in homology]]

$$ 
  \cdots 
    \to 
  H_q (F_{p-1} C_\bullet) 
    \to 
  H_q (F_p C_\bullet) 
    \to 
  H_q(F_p C_\bullet / F_{q-1} C_\bullet) 
    \to 
  H_{q-1}(F_{p-1} C_\bullet)
   \to
 \cdots 
$$

which are induced by the short exact sequences 

$$
  0 \to F_{p-1}C_q \hookrightarrow F_p C_q \to F_p C_q / F_{p-1} C_q \to 0
$$

coming from the filtering.


## Definition

We give the definition 

* [via relative homology](#ExplicitDefinition)

and

* [via exact couples](#ViaExactCouples).

### Via relative homology
 {#ExplicitDefinition}

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]], such as $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$.

Let 

$$
  \cdots
  \hookrightarrow
  F_{p-1}C_\bullet \hookrightarrow F_p C_\bullet \hookrightarrow
  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  C_\bullet
$$

be a [[filtered chain complex]] in $\mathcal{A}$, with [[associated graded]] complex denoted $G_\bullet C_\bullet$.

In more detail this means that

1. $[\cdots \stackrel{\partial_{n}}{\to} C_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to}] C_{n-1} \to \cdots]$ is a [[chain complex]], hence $\{C_n\}$ are [[objects]] in $\mathcal{A}$ ($R$-[[modules]]) and $\{\partial_n\}$ are [[morphisms]] (module [[homomorphisms]]) with $\partial_n \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$;

1. For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a [[filtered object|filtering]] $F_\bullet C_n$ on $C_n$ and all these filterings are compatible with the [[diffreentials]] in that 

   $$
     \partial(F_p C_n) \subset F_p C_{n-1}
   $$

1. The grading associated to the filtreing is suhh that the $p$-graded element in $C_n$ are those in the [[quotient]]

   $$
     G_p C_n \coloneqq \frac{F_p C_n}{ F_{p-1} C_n}
     \,.
   $$

We use element-notation in the following as if $\mathcal{A}$ were a category of [[modules]]. 


#### $r$-Approximate cycles and boundaries
 {#InterpretationOfTerms}


+-- {: .num_defn #ApproximateChainsCyclesBoundaries}
###### Definition

Given a [[filtered chain complex]] $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ as above we say for all $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ that

1. $G_p C_{p+q}$ is the object of **$(p,q)$-[[chains]]** or of **$(p+q)$-chains in filtering degree $p$**;


1. $\begin{aligned} Z^r_{p,q}  & \coloneqq \left\{ c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \, mod F_{p-r} C_{\bullet} \right\} \\ & =  \left\{ c \in F_p C_{p+q} | \partial(c) \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} \right\}/ F_{p-1}C_{p+q} \end{aligned}$

   is the object of **the $r$-approximate $(p,q)$-[[cycles]]**: 

   the $(p+q)$-chains whose differential vanishes modulo terms of filtering degree $p-r$: 


1. $B^{r}_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial(F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1}) \,,$

   is the object of **$r$-approximate $(p,q)$-[[boundaries]]**.

=--

From this definition we immediately have that the differentials $\partial \colon C_{p+q} \to C_{p+q-1}$ restrict to the $r$-approximate cycles as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #DifferentialsOnApproximateChains}
###### Proposition

The [[differentials]] of $C_\bullet$ restrict on $r$-approximate cycles to morphisms of the form

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$

These are still [[differentials]]: $\partial^2 = 0$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the very definition of $Z^r_{p,q}$ it consists of elements in filtering degree $p$ on which $\partial$ decreases the filtering degree to $p-r$. Also by definition of differential on a chain complex, $\partial$ decreases the actual degree $p+q$ by one. This explains that $\partial$ restricted to $Z^r_{p,q}$ lands in $Z^\bullet_{p-r,q+r-1}$. 

Now the image constists indeed of actual boundaries, not just $r$-approximate boundaries. But since actual boundaries are in particular $r$-approximate boundaries, we may take the codomain to be $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #KernelsInsideApproximateCycles}
###### Proposition

The $(r+1)$-approximate cycles are the $\partial^r$-kernel inside the $r$-approximate cycles:

$$
  Z^{r+1}_{p,q}
  = 
  ker( Z^r_{p,q} \stackrel{\partial^r}{\to} Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1} )
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

An element $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ represents 

1. an element in $Z^r_{p,q}$ if $\partial c \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$

1. an element in $Z^{r+1}_{p,q}$ if even $\partial c \in F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1} \hookrightarrow F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$.

The second condition is equivalent to $\partial c$ representing the 0-element in the quotient $F_{p-r}C_{p+q-1}/ F_{p-r-1}C_{p+q-1}$. But this is in turn equivalent to $\partial c$ being 0 in $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \subset F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} / F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1}$.

#### $r$-Approximate homology groups: the spectral sequence

Let $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ be a [[filtered chain complex]] as above.

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitForm}
###### Definition

For $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ define the **$r$-approximate $(p,q)$-[[chain homology]]** of the filtered complex to be the [[quotient]] of the $r$-approximate $(p,q)$-cycles by the $r$-approximate $(p,q)$-boundaries, def. \ref{ApproximateChainsCyclesBoundaries}:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^r_{p,q}
    & \coloneqq
    \frac{Z^r_{p,q}}{B^r_{p,q}}
    \\
    & = 
  \frac{
    \left\{
     x \in F_p C_{p+q} \,|\, \partial x \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}
    \right\}
  }
  {
    \partial( F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1} ) \oplus F_{p-1} C_{p+q} 
  }
  \end{aligned}
$$

By prop. \ref{DifferentialsOnApproximateChains} the differentials of $C_\bullet$ restrict on the $r$-approximate homology groups to maps

$$
  \partial_r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-q, q+r - 1}
  \,.
$$


=--




+-- {: .num_prop #ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ}
###### Proposition

Definition \ref{ExplicitForm} indeed gives a [[spectral sequence]] in that
$E^{r+1}_{\bullet, \bullet}$ is indeed the $\partial_r$-[[chain homology]] of $E^r_{\bullet, \bullet}$, i.e.

$$
  E^{r+1}_{p,q} 
  = 
 \frac{
    ker(\partial_r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1})
  }{
    im( \partial_r : E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} \to E^r_{p,q} )
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{KernelsInsideApproximateCycles}.

### Via exact couples
 {#ViaExactCouples}

The whole of the spectral sequence can be defined as the [[spectral sequence]] of the [exact couple](spectral+sequence#exact_couples)

$$ D\overset{\varphi}{\to} D \to E \to D $$

where 

* $D \coloneqq \bigoplus_i H^{\bullet}(F_i) $

* and where $\varphi$ is the cohomology morphism induced by the inclusion of chain complexes $F_i\to F_{i+1}$ 

* and $E \coloneqq \bigoplus_i H^\bullet(F_i/F_{i-1})$ is the total cohomology of the associated bigraded complex.  

At every stage we have a new family of long exact sequences



## Properties

### In low-degree pages

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

We have

* $E^0_{p,q} = G_p C_{p+q}$ 

  is the [[associated graded|associated p-graded]] piece of $C_{p+q}$;

* $E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$

  is the chain homology of $C_\bullet$ in filtering degree $p$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r = 0$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} restricts to

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = \frac{ F_p C_{p+q}}{F_{p-1} C_{p+q}} = G_p C_{p+q}
$$

because for $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ we automatically also have $\partial c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ since the differential respects the filtering degree by assumption. 

For $r = 1$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives 

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = \frac{\{c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \in G_p C_{p+q}\} }{\partial(F_p C_{p+q})} = H_{p+q} (G_p C_\bullet)
  \,.
$$


=--



### Convergence

#### General

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If the filtration of $C_\bullet$ is bounded in each degree, then 
the spectral sequence of prop. \ref{ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ}
indeed converges to the chain homology of $C_\bullet$

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(C)
  \,,
$$

i.e. for sufficiently large $r$ we have

$$
  E^r_{p,q} = G_p H_{p+q}(C)
  \,.
$$

=--



#### Via exact couples

It is instructive to note that in the $n$th derived [[exact couple]] $\varphi^n D\to E_{(n)} \to \varphi^n D\to{}$, the hidden part $\varphi^n D$ is the [[module|submodule]] $D_{(n)}$ of $\bigoplus_{i} H(F_{i+n})$, as it meets $H(F_{i+n})$ representable by elements of $F_i$; that is, we may sensibly call it
$$F_{i} D_{(n)} = \frac{\ker(d)\cap F_i}{F_i\cap dF_{i+n}}.$$
Separating the grades, the exactness of the couple at $E_{(n)}$ then says 
$$ F_{i} H^j(F_{i+n})\to F_{i+1}H^j(F_{i+n+1}) \to E_{(n)}^{i\dots} \to F_i H^{j+1}(F_{i+n}) \to F_{i+1}H^{j+1}(F_{i+n+1}) $$

One can see this as converging (if it sensibly converges) to either a subquotient of $F_i$ _or_ to a [[module|submodule]] $F_i H^\bullet(C) \lt H^\bullet(C)$.  Taking the latter interpretation, we hope to find in the limiting case exact sequences
$$ F_i H^j(C)\to F_{i+1} H^j(C) \to E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots} \to F_i H^{j+1}(C) \to F_{i+1} H^{j+1}(C).$$
At this stage one can check that the morphisms $F_i H^j(C)\to F_{i+1} H^j(C)$ are indeed definable, and in fact injective, so that whatever $E_{(\infty)}$ should be, the morphism $E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots}\to F_i H^{j+1}$ is null; that is, our long-exact sequence breaks up into the 
[[short exact sequence]]s
$$ 0\to F_i H^j(C) \to F_{i+1} H^j(C)\to E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots} \to 0 .$$

In summary, if the spectral sequence $E_{(n)}$ converges in a sensible way to the correct thing $E_{(\infty)}$, then that correct thing is also the associated graded [[module]] of the [[filtration]] of $H^\bullet(C)$ induced by the [[filtration]] of $C$.


## Examples

### 2-term filtering

The special case where the filtering has just length one  is that where we simply have a sub-complex $C^{(1)}_\bullet \hookrightarrow C_\bullet$ and want to compute the homology of $C_\bullet$ from that of $C^{(1)}_\bullet$ and $C_\bullet/C^{(1)}_\bullet$.

This case is easily solved by elementary means and it serves as an instructive blueprint for the general case.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given a [[subobject|sub]]-[[chain complex]] $C^{(1)}_\bullet \hookrightarrow C_\bullet$, consider the following constructions

1. Consider the [[short exact sequence]]

   $$
     0 \to C^{(1)}_\bullet \to C_\bullet \to C_\bullet/C^{(1)}_\bullet \to 0
   $$

1. Its [[long exact sequence in homology]] contains the [[connecting homomorphism]] 

   $$
     \delta 
      : 
     H_\bullet(C_\bullet/C^{(1)}_\bullet)
      \to
     H_{\bullet-1}(C^{(1)}_\bullet)
     \,.
   $$

   Define

   * $G_1 H_\bullet \coloneqq ker \delta$

   * $G_2 H_\bullet \coloneqq coker \delta$.

Then $H_\bullet(C_\bullet)$ is sits in the short exact sequence

$$
  0 \to G_0 H_\bullet \to H_\bullet(C_\bullet) \to G_1 H_\bullet \to 0
  \,.
$$

### Homology of a tensor product of chain complexes
 {#ExampleHomologyOfTensorProduct}


Consider two chain complexes $C_\bullet, C'_\bullet$ 
of [[vector spaces]] over a [[field]] $k$, both
in non-negative degree.

Their [[tensor product of chain complexes]] is

$$
  C_\bullet \otimes C'_\bullet
  = 
  \oplus_{i+j = k} C_i \otimes C_j
$$

with [[differential]] on homogenous elements

$$
  \partial (\alpha \otimes\beta) = 
  (\partial \alpha)
  \otimes \beta
  +
  (-1)^{deg \alpha} \alpha \otimes \partial \beta
  \,.
$$

We may compute the chain homology of $C \otimes C'$ by a 
filter spectral sequence as follows.

Define a filtration on $C \otimes C'$ by

$$
  F_p(C \otimes C')_{k}
  \coloneqq
  \oplus_{i \leq p} C_i \otimes C_{k-1}
  \,.
$$

This means that the [[associated graded object]] is simply

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = G_p (C \otimes C')_{p+q}
  = 
  C_p \otimes C'_q
  \,.
$$

The [[differential]] on this is $\partial_{r = 0} = (-1)^p id_{C} \otimes \partial'$.
Hence the [[universal coefficient theorem]] gives

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = C_p \otimes H_q(C')
  \,.
$$

The next differential is $\partial_1 = \partial \otimes id_{C'}$
Since $k$ is assumed to be a field we have thus

$$
  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(C_\bullet \otimes H_q(C'_\bullet))
  = 
  H_p(C)\otimes H_q(C')
  \,.
$$

Therefore every element in $E^2_{p,q}$ is represented by 
a tensor product of a $C$-[[cycle]] with a $C'$-cycle and is 
hence itself a $(C \otimes C')$-cycle. Since the differentials
in the spectral sequence all come from the differential on 
$C \otimes C'$, this means that all higher differentials vanish,
and so the sequence collapses on the $E^2$-page. 

The convergence of the spectral sequence to the the homology 
of $C \otimes C'$ thus says that this is given by

$$
  H_{k}(C \otimes C')
  \simeq
  \oplus_{i+j = k} H_i(C) \otimes H_j(C')
  \,.
$$


### Homology of the total complex of a double complex
 {#ExampleHomologyDoubleComplex}


The [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] is naturally 
[[filtered object|filtered]] either by either row-degree of column-degree. The corresponding filtering spectral sequence converges under good conditions to the homology of the total complex. See at _[[spectral sequence of a double complex]]_. 

### Singular homology of a CW-complex

Let $X \in Top$ be a [[CW-complex]] equipped with an explicit structure of a [[filtered topological space]] $X^0 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X^n \hookrightarrow \cdots X$.
This induces on the [[singular homology]] complex $C_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[filtered chain complex]] by 

$$
  F_q C_\bullet(X) \coloneqq C_\bullet(X^p)
  \,.
$$

The [[associated graded object]] is

$$
  G_p C_{p+q}(X) = E^0_{p,q} = C_{p+q}(X^p)/C_{p+q}(X^{p-1})
  \,.
$$

The chain homology of the associated graded chain complex is therefore the [[relative homology]]

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(X^p, X^{p-1})
  \,.
$$

Now by assumption that $X^\bullet$ is the cell decomposition of a [[cell complex]] we have

$$
  H_{p+q}(X^p, X^{p+1}) 
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
      \mathbb{Z}[pCells(X)] & q = 0
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

The chain homology of

$$
  \partial \colon 
   H_p(X^p, X^{p-1})
  \to 
  H_{p-1}(X^{p-1}, X^{p-2})
$$

is the cellular chain homology $H^{cell}_p(X)$. 
One finds that

$$
  E^2_{p,q} = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      H_p^{cell}(X) & q = 0
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Since this is concentrated in the $q = 0 $-row all higher-$r$ differentials vanish. 

Hence $H_p(X) \simeq H^{cell}_p(X)$



### Serre's spectral sequence of a fibration

We indicate the [[Leray-Serre spectral sequence]] of a [[Serre fibration]] as a special case of the filtering spectral sequence. For more discussion see there.

$$\begin{matrix} A & \to & X \\
 \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
 * & \to & B \end{matrix} $$
be a [[Serre fibration]] of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological spaces]] in which $B$ is a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[CW-complex]].  Then the $k$-[[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]] of $B$ naturally give filtered-space structures to both $B$ and $X$:
$$\begin{matrix} X_{(k)} & \to & X_{(k+1)} & \to & X \\
 \downarrow & & \downarrow & &\downarrow \\
 B_{k} & \to & B_{k+1} & \to & B \end{matrix} $$
and in turn induce filtrations of the singular chain complex of $X$.

The homology [[Serre spectral sequence]] for the fibration is essentially that of this filtered complex.

It is straight-forward to show that the pair $(X_{k+1};X_k)$ is $k$-connected, and in particular the relative homology $H_i(X_{k+1};X_k)$ vanishes for $i\leq k$; this ensures that the spectral sequence is 1st/3rd quadrant (And _nota bene_: this is also a handy way to remember what the bigrading actually is).

There is also an important result about the _second_ page of this spectral sequence


+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

*The page $E^{(2)}$ of the homology Serre spectral sequence is given by*
$$ E^{(2)}_{p,q} \simeq H_p(B,\mathcal{H}_q(A|_{b})) $$
*the homology of $B$ with coefficients in the [[local system]] defined by the action of $\Pi_1 (B)$ on $H_q(A|_{b})$.  In the special case that $B$ is simply connected, these local systems are canonically equivalent to $H_q(A)$, the homology of the fiber over the basepoint.
