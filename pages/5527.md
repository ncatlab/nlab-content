## Idea


The [[spectral sequence]] of a [[filtered object|filtered]] (co)[[chain complex]] 

$$
  \cdots 
    \hookrightarrow
   F_{p-1}C_\bullet 
     \hookrightarrow 
   F_p C_\bullet 
     \hookrightarrow  
   \cdots 
     \hookrightarrow 
  C_\bullet
$$

is a tool for computing the (co)[[chain homology]] of $C_\bullet$ from the  (co)chain homologies of the [[associated graded objects]] 

$$
  G_p C \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet/F_{p-1}C_\bullet
  \,;
$$

which is in general simpler.

Equivalently, it is a tool for organizing data derivable from the families of [[long exact sequence in homology]]

$$ 
  \cdots 
    \to 
  H_q (F_{p-1} C_\bullet) 
    \to 
  H_q (F_p C_\bullet) 
    \to 
  H_q(F_p C_\bullet / F_{q-1} C_\bullet) 
    \to 
  H_{q-1}(F_{p-1} C_\bullet)
   \to
 \cdots 
$$

which are induced by the short exact sequences 

$$
  0 \to F_{p-1}C_q \to F_p C_q \to F_p C_q / F_{p-1} C_q \to 0
$$

coming from the filtering.


## Definition

We give the definition 

* [explicitly](#ExplicitDefinition)

and

* [via exact couples](#ViaExactCouples).

### Explicitly
 {#ExplicitDefinition}

Let 

$$
  \cdots
  \hookrightarrow
  F_{p-1}C_\bullet \hookrightarrow F_p C_\bullet \hookrightarrow
  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  C_\bullet
$$

be a [[filtered object|filtered]] [[chain complex]] with [[associated graded|associated graded]] complex denoted $G_\bullet C_\bullet$.

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitForm}
###### Definition

For $r,p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$ define objects

$$
  E^r_{p,q}
   \coloneqq
  \frac{
    \left\{
     x \in F_p C_{p+q} \,|\, \partial x \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}
    \right\}
  }
  {
    \partial( F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1} ) \oplus F_{p-1} C_{p+q} 
  }
$$

and morphisms

$$
  \partial_r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-q, q+r - 1}
$$

given by $\partial^C$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The group $E^r_{p,q}$ is to be thought of as the _approximate_ chain homology of $C_\bullet$ in degree $p+q$ where the differential is required to vanish only "to order $r$" (is in $F_{p-r}$) and boundaries are similarly modded out only in order $r$. More discussion of this is [below](#InterpretationOfTerms).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ}
###### Proposition

Definition \ref{ExplicitForm} indeed gives a [[spectral sequence]] in that
the $\partial_r$ are well defined and for all $r$ we have that $E^{r+1}_{\bullet, \bullet}$ is indeed the chain homology of $E^r_{\bullet, \bullet}$, i.e.

$$
  E^r_{p,q} 
  = 
 \frac{
    ker(\partial_r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1})
  }{
    im( \partial_r : E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} \to E^r_{p,q} )
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If the filtration of $C_\bullet$ is bounded in each degree, then 
the spectral sequence of prop. \ref{ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ}
indeed converges to the chain homology of $C_\bullet$

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(C)
  \,,
$$

i.e. for sufficiently large $r$ we have

$$
  E^r_{p,q} = G_p H_{p+q}(C)
  \,.
$$

### Via exact couples
 {#ViaExactCouples}

The whole of the spectral sequence can be defined as the [[spectral sequence]] of the [exact couple](spectral+sequence#exact_couples)

$$ D\overset{\varphi}{\to} D \to E \to D $$

where $D = \bigoplus_i H^{\bullet}(F_i)$, where $\varphi$ is the cohomology morphism induced by the inclusion of chain complexes $F_i\to F_{i+1}$ and $E = \bigoplus_i H^\bullet(F_i/F_{i-1})$, the total cohomology of the associated bigraded complex.  (The usual bigrading of the initial term is a bit weird maybe, but we'll get used to that.)

At every stage we have a new family of long exact sequences



## Properties

### In low-degree pages

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For $r = 0$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} says that

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = G_p C_{p+q}
$$

is the [[associated graded|associated p-graded]] piece of $C_{p+q}$. Accordingly for $r = 1$ we have that

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)
$$

is the homology of the degree-$p$ piece.

=--

### Interpretation of the terms: $r$-approximate cycles/boundaries
 {#InterpretationOfTerms}

The terms $E^r_{p,q}$ in def. \ref{ExplicitForm}
have a natural interpretation as the _$r$-approximate homology groups_ of $C_\bullet$, in the following sense.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  Z^r_{p,q} 
   \coloneqq
  \left\{
   c \in F_p C_{p+q} | \partial(c) \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q}
  \right\}/ F_{p-1}C_{p+q}
$$

These are the $(p+q)$-chains in filtering degree $p$ whose differential vanishes modulo terms of filtering degree $p-r$: **the $r$-approximate $(p,q)$-[[chains]]**.

Write similarly

$$
  B^{r}_{p,q}
  \coloneqq
  \partial(A^{r-1}_{p+r-1,q}) / F_{p-1}C_{p+q}
  \,,
$$

the group of $r$-approximate $(p,q)$-[[boundaries]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

With this notation the groups in def. \ref{ExplicitForm} are simply the
$r$-approximate [[homology groups]]:

$$
  E^r_{p,q} = 
  \frac{Z^r_{p,q}}{B^r_{p,q}}
  \,.
$$

=--

### Convergence

#### Convergence, ideally

It is instructive to note that in the $n$th derived [[exact couple]] $\varphi^n D\to E_{(n)} \to \varphi^n D\to{}$, the hidden part $\varphi^n D$ is the [[module|submodule]] $D_{(n)}$ of $\bigoplus_{i} H(F_{i+n})$, as it meets $H(F_{i+n})$ representable by elements of $F_i$; that is, we may sensibly call it
$$F_{i} D_{(n)} = \frac{\ker(d)\cap F_i}{F_i\cap dF_{i+n}}.$$
Separating the grades, the exactness of the couple at $E_{(n)}$ then says 
$$ F_{i} H^j(F_{i+n})\to F_{i+1}H^j(F_{i+n+1}) \to E_{(n)}^{i\dots} \to F_i H^{j+1}(F_{i+n}) \to F_{i+1}H^{j+1}(F_{i+n+1}) $$

One can see this as converging (if it sensibly converges) to either a subquotient of $F_i$ _or_ to a [[module|submodule]] $F_i H^\bullet(C) \lt H^\bullet(C)$.  Taking the latter interpretation, we hope to find in the limiting case exact sequences
$$ F_i H^j(C)\to F_{i+1} H^j(C) \to E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots} \to F_i H^{j+1}(C) \to F_{i+1} H^{j+1}(C).$$
At this stage one can check that the morphisms $F_i H^j(C)\to F_{i+1} H^j(C)$ are indeed definable, and in fact injective, so that whatever $E_{(\infty)}$ should be, the morphism $E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots}\to F_i H^{j+1}$ is null; that is, our long-exact sequence breaks up into the 
[[short exact sequence]]s
$$ 0\to F_i H^j(C) \to F_{i+1} H^j(C)\to E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots} \to 0 .$$

In summary, if the spectral sequence $E_{(n)}$ converges in a sensible way to the correct thing $E_{(\infty)}$, then that correct thing is also the associated graded [[module]] of the [[filtration]] of $H^\bullet(C)$ induced by the [[filtration]] of $C$.


## Examples

### 2-term filtering

The special case where the filtering has just length one  is that where we simply have a sub-complex $C^{(1)}_\bullet \hookrightarrow C_\bullet$ and want to compute the homology of $C_\bullet$ from that of $C^{(1)}_\bullet$ and $C_\bullet/C^{(1)}_\bullet$.

This case is easily solved by elementary means and it serves as an instructive blueprint for the general case.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given a [[subobject|sub]]-[[chain complex]] $C^{(1)}_\bullet \hookrightarrow C_\bullet$, consider the following constructions

1. Consider the [[short exact sequence]]

   $$
     0 \to C^{(1)}_\bullet \to C_\bullet \to C_\bullet/C^{(1)}_\bullet \to 0
   $$

1. Its [[long exact sequence in homology]] contains the [[connecting homomorphism]] 

   $$
     \delta 
      : 
     H_\bullet(C_\bullet/C^{(1)}_\bullet)
      \to
     H_{\bullet-1}(C^{(1)}_\bullet)
     \,.
   $$

   Define

   * $G_1 H_\bullet \coloneqq ker \delta$

   * $G_2 H_\bullet \coloneqq coker \delta$.

Then $H_\bullet(C_\bullet)$ is sits in the short exact sequence

$$
  0 \to G_0 H_\bullet \to H_\bullet(C_\bullet) \to G_1 H_\bullet \to 0
  \,.
$$

### Homology of a tensor product of chain complexes
 {#ExampleHomologyOfTensorProduct}


Consider two chain complexes $C_\bullet, C'_\bullet$ 
of [[vector spaces]] over a [[field]] $k$, both
in non-negative degree.

Their [[tensor product of chain complexes]] is

$$
  C_\bullet \otimes C'_\bullet
  = 
  \oplus_{i+j = k} C_i \otimes C_j
$$

with [[differential]] on homogenous elements

$$
  \partial (\alpha \otimes\beta) = 
  (\partial \alpha)
  \otimes \beta
  +
  (-1)^{deg \alpha} \alpha \otimes \partial \beta
  \,.
$$

We may compute the chain homology of $C \otimes C'$ by a 
filter spectral sequence as follows.

Define a filtration on $C \otimes C'$ by

$$
  F_p(C \otimes C')_{k}
  \coloneqq
  \oplus_{i \leq p} C_i \otimes C_{k-1}
  \,.
$$

This means that the [[associated graded object]] is simply

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = G_p (C \otimes C')_{p+q}
  = 
  C_p \otimes C'_q
  \,.
$$

The [[differential]] on this is $\partial_{r = 0} = (-1)^p id_{C} \otimes \partial'$.
Hence the [[universal coefficient theorem]] gives

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = C_p \otimes H_q(C')
  \,.
$$

The next differential is $\partial_1 = \partial \otimes id_{C'}$
Since $k$ is assumed to be a field we have thus

$$
  E^2_{p,q} = H_p(C_\bullet \otimes H_q(C'_\bullet))
  = 
  H_p(C)\otimes H_q(C')
  \,.
$$

Therefore every element in $E^2_{p,q}$ is represented by 
a tensor product of a $C$-[[cycle]] with a $C'$-cycle and is 
hence itself a $(C \otimes C')$-cycle. Since the differentials
in the spectral sequence all come from the differential on 
$C \otimes C'$, this means that all higher differentials vanish,
and so the sequence collapses on the $E^2$-page. 

The convergence of the spectral sequence to the the homology 
of $C \otimes C'$ thus says that this is given by

$$
  H_{k}(C \otimes C')
  \simeq
  \oplus_{i+j = k} H_i(C) \otimes H_j(C')
  \,.
$$


### Homology of the total complex of a double complex
 {#ExampleHomologyDoubleComplex}


The [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] is naturally 
[[filtered object|filtered]] either by either row-degree of column-degree. The corresponding filtering spectral sequence converges under good conditions to the homology of the total complex. See at _[[spectral sequence of a double complex]]_. 

### Singular homology of a CW-complex

(...)


### Serre's spectral sequence of a fibration

We indicate the [[Leray-Serre spectral sequence]] of a [[Serre fibration]] as a special case of the filtering spectral sequence. For more discussion see there.

$$\begin{matrix} A & \to & X \\
 \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
 * & \to & B \end{matrix} $$
be a [[Serre fibration]] of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological spaces]] in which $B$ is a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[CW-complex]].  Then the $k$-[[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]] of $B$ naturally give filtered-space structures to both $B$ and $X$:
$$\begin{matrix} X_{(k)} & \to & X_{(k+1)} & \to & X \\
 \downarrow & & \downarrow & &\downarrow \\
 B_{k} & \to & B_{k+1} & \to & B \end{matrix} $$
and in turn induce filtrations of the singular chain complex of $X$.

The homology [[Serre spectral sequence]] for the fibration is essentially that of this filtered complex.

It is straight-forward to show that the pair $(X_{k+1};X_k)$ is $k$-connected, and in particular the relative homology $H_i(X_{k+1};X_k)$ vanishes for $i\leq k$; this ensures that the spectral sequence is 1st/3rd quadrant (And _nota bene_: this is also a handy way to remember what the bigrading actually is).

There is also an important result about the _second_ page of this spectral sequence


+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

*The page $E^{(2)}$ of the homology Serre spectral sequence is given by*
$$ E^{(2)}_{p,q} \simeq H_p(B,\mathcal{H}_q(A|_{b})) $$
*the homology of $B$ with coefficients in the [[local system]] defined by the action of $\Pi_1 (B)$ on $H_q(A|_{b})$.  In the special case that $B$ is simply connected, these local systems are canonically equivalent to $H_q(A)$, the homology of the fiber over the basepoint.
