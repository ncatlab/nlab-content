## Idea


The [[spectral sequence]] $E_{(n)}^{p,q}$ of a $\mathbb{Z}$-filtered graded cohomology [[chain complex|complex]] $d:F_i{C_j} \to F_i C_{j+1}$ is a tool for organizing data derivable from the families of [[fiber sequence|long exact cohomology sequences]]
$$ \cdots\to H^j (F_i) \to H^j (F_{i+1}) \to H^j(F_{i+1}/F_i) \to H^{j+1}(F_i)\to\cdots $$


## Definition

The whole of the spectral sequence can be defined as the [[spectral sequence]] of the [exact couple](spectral+sequence#exact_couples)

$$ D\overset{\varphi}{\to} D \to E \to D $$

where $D = \bigoplus_i H^{\bullet}(F_i)$, where $\varphi$ is the cohomology morphism induced by the inclusion of chain complexes $F_i\to F_{i+1}$ and $E = \bigoplus_i H^\bullet(F_i/F_{i-1})$, the total cohomology of the associated bigraded complex.  (The usual bigrading of the initial term is a bit weird maybe, but we'll get used to that.)

At every stage we have a new family of long exact sequences

#### Convergence, ideally

It is instructive to note that in the $n$th derived exact couple $\varphi^n D\to E_{(n)} \to \varphi^n D\to{}$, the hidden part $\varphi^n D$ is the [[module|submodule]] $D_{(n)}$ of $\bigoplus_{i} H(F_{i+n})$, as it meets $H(F_{i+n})$ representable by elements of $F_i$; that is, we may sensibly call it
$$F_{i} D_{(n)} = \frac{\ker(d)\cap F_i}{F_i\cap dF_{i+n}}.$$
Separating the grades, the exactness of the couple at $E_{(n)}$ then says 
$$ F_{i} H^j(F_{i+n})\to F_{i+1}H^j(F_{i+n+1}) \to E_{(n)}^{i\dots} \to F_i H^{j+1}(F_{i+n}) \to F_{i+1}H^{j+1}(F_{i+n+1}) $$

One can see this as converging (if it sensibly converges) to either a subquotient of $F_i$ _or_ to a [[module|submodule]] $F_i H^\bullet(C) \lt H^\bullet(C)$.  Taking the latter interpretation, we hope to find in the limiting case exact sequences
$$ F_i H^j(C)\to F_{i+1} H^j(C) \to E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots} \to F_i H^{j+1}(C) \to F_{i+1} H^{j+1}(C).$$
At this stage one can check that the morphisms $F_i H^j(C)\to F_{i+1} H^j(C)$ are indeed definable, and in fact injective, so that whatever $E_{(\infty)}$ should be, the morphism $E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots}\to F_i H^{j+1}$ is null; that is, our long-exact sequence breaks up into the 
[[short exact sequence]]s
$$ 0\to F_i H^j(C) \to F_{i+1} H^j(C)\to E_{(\infty)}^{i\dots} \to 0 .$$

In summary, if the spectral sequence $E_{(n)}$ converges in a sensible way to the correct thing $E_{(\infty)}$, then that correct thing is also the associated graded [[module]] of the [[filtration]] of $H^\bullet(C)$ induced by the [[filtration]] of $C$.

## Application: Serre's Spectral Sequence for a Fibration

Let
$$\begin{matrix} A & \to & X \\
 \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
 * & \to & B \end{matrix} $$
be a [[fibration]] of pointed spaces in which $B$ is a connected [[CW-complex]].  Then the $k$-skeleta of $B$ naturally give filtered-space structures to both $B$ and $X$:
$$\begin{matrix} X_{(k)} & \to & X_{(k+1)} & \to & X \\
 \downarrow & & \downarrow & &\downarrow \\
 B_{k} & \to & B_{k+1} & \to & B \end{matrix} $$
and in turn induce filtrations of the singular chain complex of $X$.

The homology Serre spectral sequence for the fibration is essentially that of this filtered complex.

It is straight-forward to show that the pair $(X_{k+1};X_k)$ is $k$-connected, and in particular the relative homology $H_i(X_{k+1};X_k)$ vanishes for $i\leq k$; this ensures that the spectral sequence is 1st/3rd quadrant (And _nota bene_: this is also a handy way to remember what the bigrading actually is).

There is also an important result about the _second_ page of this spectral sequence

###### Theorem
*The page $E^{(2)}$ of the homology Serre spectral sequence is given by*
$$ E^{(2)}_{p,q} \simeq H_p(B,\mathcal{H}_q(A|_{b})) $$
*the homology of $B$ with coefficients in the [[local system]] defined by the action of $\Pi_1 (B)$ on $H_q(A|_{b})$.  In the special case that $B$ is simply connected, these local systems are canonically equivalent to $H_q(A)$, the homology of the fiber over the basepoint.
