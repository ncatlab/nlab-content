## Idea

A [[topological manifold|topological]] [[7-sphere]] equipped with an [[exotic smooth structure]] is called an _exotic 7-sphere_.

## Constructions
 {#Construction}

[Milnor (1956)](#Milnor1956) gave the first examples of exotic smooth structures on the [[7-sphere]], finding at least seven. 

The [[exotic 7-spheres]] constructed in [Milnor 1956](#Milnor1956) are all examples of [[fibre bundles]] over the [[4-sphere]] $S^4$ with [[fibre]] the [[3-sphere]] $S^3$, with [[structure group]] the [[special orthogonal group]] [[SO(4)]] (see also at _[[8-manifold]]_ the section _[With exotic boundary 7-spheres](8-manifold#ExoticBoundary7Spheres)_):

By the classification of bundles on spheres via the [[clutching construction]], these correspond to [[homotopy classes]] of maps $S^3 \to SO(4)$, i.e. elements of $\pi_3(SO(4))$. From the table at [orthogonal group -- Homotopy groups](orthogonal+group#HomotopyGroups), this latter group is $\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}$. Thus any such bundle can be described, up to [[isomorphism]], by a [[pair]] of [[integers]] $(n,m)$. When $n+m=1$, then one can show there is a [[Morse function]] with exactly two [[critical points]] on the total space of the bundle, and hence this 7-manifold is [[homeomorphic]] to a sphere.

The  [[fractional first Pontryagin class]] $\frac{p_1}{2} \in H^4(S^4) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$ of the bundle is given by $n-m$. Milnor constructs, using [[cobordism]] theory and [[Hirzebruch's signature theorem]] for 8-manifolds, a mod-7 diffeomorphism invariant of the manifold, so that it is standard 7-sphere precisely when $\frac{p_1}{2}^2 -1 = 0 (mod 7)$.

By using the [[connected sum]] operation, the set of smooth, non-diffeomorphic structures on the $n$-sphere has the structure of an [[abelian group]]. 
For the [[7-sphere]], it is the [[cyclic group]] $Z/{28}$ and Brieskorn (1966) found the generator $\Sigma$ so that $\underbrace{\Sigma\#\cdots\#\Sigma}_28$ is the standard sphere.

## Examples

* [[Gromoll-Meyer sphere]]


## Properties

### As near-horizon geometries of black M2-branes
 {#AsNearHorizonGeometriesOfBlackM2Branes}


From the point of view of [[M-theory on 8-manifolds]], these [[8-manifolds]] $X$ with (exotic) [[7-sphere]] [[boundaries]] correspond to [[near horizon limits]] of [[black brane|black]] [[M2 brane]] spacetimes $\mathbb{R}^{2,1} \times X$, where the [[M2-branes]] themselves would be sitting at the center of the [[7-spheres]] (if that were included in the spacetime, see also [[Dirac charge quantization]]).
