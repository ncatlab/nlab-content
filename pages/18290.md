## Statement

Every [[metric space]], regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]], is a [[fully normal topological space]].

## Applications

Together with _Stone's theorem_ that [[fully normal spaces are equivalently paracompact]] this imlies that [[metric spaces are paracompact]].
