## Idea

Lattice gauge theory is a [[computation|Computational]] model for [[gauge theory]] ([[Yang-Mills theory]]).

These are numerical simulation of [[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]] [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative QCD]] obtained by discretizing the Euclidean [[spacetime]] to a _lattice_ [[graph]] of [[vertices]] and [[edges]] between them, regarding the [[gauge field]] as a function on the [[edges]] (assigning to an edge the [[holonomy]]/[[parallel transport]] of the gauge field) and then explicitly evaluating the would-be [[path integral]] of the [[Yang-Mills action]] over these field configurations as an approximate numerical sum. 

Specifically for [[QCD]] this is also called _lattice QCD_, etc.

Hence this yieds numerical values for [[correlation functions]] etc. which are non-perturbative in the [[coupling constant]] but nevertheless approximate, due to finite lattice spacing and numerical error. 

Since the explicit [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] formulation of [[Yang-Mills theories]] such as [[QCD]] is presently wide open (see also at _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_) these numerical simulation provide, besides [[experiment]] (e.g. of in particular of [[quark-gluon plasma]]), a key insight into the non-perturbative nature of the theory, such as its [[instanton sea]] ([Gruber 13](#Gruber13)) and the phenomenona of [[confinement]] and [[mass gap]].

Despite the word "theory", lattice gauge theory is more like "computer-simpulated [[experiment]]". While it allows to see phenomena of QCD, it usually cannot provide a conceptual explanation, and of course not a mathematical derivation.
