## Idea

The [[categorification]] of the concept of [[ring]], hence the concept of _[[2-ring]]_ in [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]] may be taken to be that of [[monoidal (∞,1)-category|monoidal]] [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

In analogy to the [[prime spectrum]] of a [[ring]], the prime spectrum of a monoidal stable $(\infty,1)$-category is the collection of [[thick subcategories]] which are [[prime ideals]], in the evident higher sense, under the given [[tensor product]].

## Examples

### The prime spectrum of the category of spectra

The prime spectrum of the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] ([[p-localization|p-local]] and [[finite spectrum|finite]]) is labeled by the [[Morava K-theories]]. This is the content of the [[thick subcategory theorem]].
