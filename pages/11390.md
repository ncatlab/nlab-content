## Idea

The [[categorification]] of the concept of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[ring]], hence the concept of (commutative) _[[2-ring]]_ in [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]] may be taken to be that of ([[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal (∞,1)-category|monoidal]] [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

In analogy to the [[prime spectrum]] of a [[commutative ring]], the prime spectrum of a symmetric monoidal stable $(\infty,1)$-category is the collection of [[thick subcategories]] which are [[prime ideals]], in the evident higher sense, under the given [[tensor product]]. On the level of [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy categories]] this concept was introduced in ([Balmer 04](#Balmer04)) as the _[[spectrum of a tensor triangulated category]]_.

## Examples

### The prime spectrum of the category of spectra
 {#OfCategoryOfSpectra}


The prime spectrum of the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] ([[p-localization|p-local]] and [[finite spectrum|finite]]) is labeled by the [[Morava K-theories]] ([Balmer 10, prop. 9.4](#Balmer10)). This follows from the the [[thick subcategory theorem]].

This is the topic of [[chromatic homotopy theory]], see at _[[Spec(S)]]_.

Generally, the [[kernel]] of any [[generalized homology theory]] here is a thick ideal, but not generally a prime ideal.
