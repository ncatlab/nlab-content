
The __trivial ring__, or __zero ring__, is the [[ring]] with a single [[element]], which is both $0$ and $1$.  We usually denote the trivial ring as $0$ or $\{0\}$, even though $1$ or $\{1\}$ would make as much sense.  It is the only ring in which $0 = 1$, by the proof
$$ x = 1 x = 0 x = 0 .$$

The trivial ring is the [[terminal object]] in [[Ring]].  It is both terminal and [[initial object|initial]] (hence a [[zero object]]) in the category of nonunital rings, but it is not initial in $Ring$ itself (as we define it).

The trivial ring is an example of a [[trivial algebra]].
