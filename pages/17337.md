##Idea

In [[type theory]], **type refinement** is a term initially coined to refer to "datasort refinements", sub-datatypes induced by refining the set of available constructors, but later broadened to include "index refinements".

Refinement types are present in languages like LiquidHaskell and F-star. Refinement types are similar to coercions and subset types.
