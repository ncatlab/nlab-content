## Idea

The **join** $S \star T$ of two [[simplicial set]]s $S$ and $T$ is a new simplicial set that may geometrically be thought of as a [[cone]] over $T$ with tip of shape $S$. 

Notably when $S = \Delta^0$ is the [[point]], this join is a genuine [[cone]] over $T$. Or if $S = 2$ is the two-point space, the join is the [[suspension]] of $T$.

If the simplicial sets in question are [[quasi-categories]] the notion of join on them produces the notion of [[join of quasi-categories]] that underlies many constructions in [[higher category theory]] such as the definition of [[limit in a quasi-category]].

The join of [[simplicial set]]s extends that historically given for [[simplicial complex|simplicial complexes]], cf. for instance the description and discussion in Spanier's classical text (page 109 and then pages 114 -116) on Algebraic Topology. 

The adaptation of this to simplicial sets reveals a neat link with some categorical structure in the category, $\Delta_a$, of finite ordinals (including the empty one).  


## Definition

The objects of the _augmented_ [[simplex category]] $\Delta_a$ can be identified with the finite totally ordered sets. 

The operation of addition of natural numbers extends to give the **ordinal sum** which gives the structure of a [[monoidal category]] to $\Delta_a$ (for details see the discussion in the entry 
[[simplex category]]).


Using the ordinary notation for the objects of the simplex category, this product acts as

$$
  \otimes_{join}: \Delta_a \times \Delta_a \to \Delta_a
$$
$$
  ([n], [m]) \mapsto [n + m + 1]
  \,,
$$

where $[n] := (0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n)$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$  is the totally ordered set with $n$-elements, as usual. 


Now, via the general process of [[Day convolution]], this monoidal structure on $\Delta_a$ is lifted to a monoidal structure on presheaves on $\Delta_a$, i.e. to the the category [[ASSet]] of augmented [[simplicial set]]s. This is given by the [[end|coend]] formula

$$
  \otimes_{join} : ASSet \times ASSet \to ASSet
$$
$$
  (S \otimes_{join} S')_n
  :=
  \int^{[i],[j] \in \Delta_a}
    S_i \times S'_j \cdot \Delta([n],[i] \otimes_{join} [j])
  \,.
$$

### Extension to a closed monoidal structure

This join tensor product forms part of a [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal structure]] on the category of
augmented simplicial sets, [[ASSet]] $ := Sets^{\Delta_a^{op}}$. The [[internal hom]] is given by
$$[X, Y ]_n =ASS(X; Dec^{n+1}Y )\,,$$
where $Dec$ is the [[decalage]] functor.


### Join of non-augmented simplicial sets

The **join** of two ordinary (not augmented) [[simplicial set]]s $S$ and $S'$ is the join of their _trivial augmentation_ ($S_{-1} = S'_{-1} = pt$). This yields

$$
  (S \otimes_{join} S')_n =: (S \star S')_n := S_n \cup S'_n \cup 
   (\cup_{i+j = n-1} S_i \times S'_j)
  \,.
$$

In this form, the join is used

## Some history

(please augment this?)

This join was studied by P. J. Ehlers, in his thesis

_Algebraic Homotopy in Simplicially Enriched Groupoids_, 1993, 
University of Wales Bangor, (see also the reference below and the Menagerie notes available from [[Tim Porter]]'s homepage.),

but was there ascribed to Jack Duskin and Don van Osdol in some unpublished notes.  The main ideas were derived there from earlier work by Bill Lawvere.

[[Tim Porter]]:  I find the initial definition given here VERY confusing. By saying the objects of $\Delta_a$ can be identified with finite sets of cardinality $0$, $1$, $2$ ... . Of course that is true, but by saying it, the ordinal property of the objects is lost.  No explicit mention of that property is made.  Perhaps I am missing something ??? The nature of the monoidal operation as being derived from 'ordinal sum' seems to be obscured here.  I have not tried to edit it as I fear that I might disturb some insight that is important from that other point of view.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: If I remember correctly I wrote this. No, there is no deeper insight hidden here, i think you are right and I should have mentioned the ordinal sum aspect. Do I understand you well that by saying "ordinal sum" we want to indicate how the tensor product acts on morphisms, is that the point you are making?

Please go ahead and edit this entry to a form that you find satisfactory. You are clearly the expert here.

[[Tim Porter|Tim]]:  Will do ... tomorrow. I am constrained by havng broken my glasses / spactacles which means typing is a pain (literally).
