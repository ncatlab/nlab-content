Gerstenhaber and Schack introduced a cohomology related to deformation theory of bialgebras. Teillefer has proven that this cohomology computes in fact the Ext-groups in certain abelian category of "tetramodules" over the bialgebra. Somewhat more systematic writeup of the proof is in the appendix of a recent paper by B. Shoikhet. 

Please distinguish the Gerstenhaber-Schack bialgebra cohomology from [[Shahn Majid]]'s bialgebra cohomology which is (in full generality) nonabelian. In $n$Lab we chose to use term [[bialgebra cocycle]] unadorned for the Majid's cocycles and always use Gerstenhaber-Schack cocycle/cohomology for the latter, as it is often referred nowdays.
