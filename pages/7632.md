**Substructural logic** is a general term for [[logic]]s in which the *[[structural rules]]*:

* the [[contraction rule]]
* the [[weakening rule]]
* the [[exchange rule]]

are not necessarily allowed, or are only allowed with restrictions.

Some particular substructural logics include:

* [[linear logic]], perhaps the best-known to category theorists, omits the contraction and weakening rules.  "Noncommutative linear logic" omits also the exchange rule.
* [[affine logic]] omits only the contraction rule.  One might call it "coaffine logic" if we omit only the weakening rule.
* Some forms of [[relevant logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] can be regarded as substructural logics (often of the coaffine variety).
