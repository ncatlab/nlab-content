## Motivation

Sometimes in the place where we expect Lie algebras, some noncommutative phenomena occur and we need to drop out the requirement of antisymmetry of the brackets. 

[[Jean-Louis Loday]] introduced Leibniz algebras, because of considerations in [[algebraic K-theory]]. Roughly speaking the [[Lie algebra homology]] is related to the appearance of cyclic homology (as it is manifest in the original work of Tsygan and then of Loday-Quillen). 

* [[Jean-Louis Loday]], [[Daniel Quillen]], _Cyclic homology and the Lie algebra homology of matrices_, 	Comm. Math. Helv. __59__, n. 1, 565-591 (1984), [doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02566367)

Lie algebra homology involves the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg chain complex]], which in turns involves the exterior powers of the Lie algebra. Loday found that there is a noncommutative generalization where roughly speaking one has the tensor and not the exterior powers of the Lie algebra in the complex; this new complex defines the __Leibniz homology__ of Lie algebras. The Leibniz homology is related to the [[Hochschild homology]] the same way the Lie algebra homology is related to the cyclic homology.

In fact this new complex for Leibniz homology further generalizes to the case of Leibniz algebras, where it computes certain [[Tor]] groups for corepresentations of Leibniz algebras. 

## Definition

Given a [[commutative unital ring]] $k$ (usually a [[field]]), a Lebniz $k$-algebra $A$ is a particular kind of [[nonassociative algebra]] over $k$ which is somewhat more general than a [[Lie algebra]] over $k$.

A __left Leibniz $k$-algebra__ is $k$-[[module]] $L$ equipped with a bracket, which is a $k$-linear map $[,]:A\otimes A \to A$ satisfying the __left Leibniz identity__

$$ [a, [b,c]] = [[a,b],c]+[b,[a,c]] $$

In other words, the left $ad$-map, $a \mapsto (ad_l a = [a,-]:L\to L)$ is a [[derivation]] of $L$ as a nonassociative algebra. Similarly, there are right Leibniz algebras, for which the right $ad$-map $ad_r :a\mapsto [-,a]:L\to L$ is a derivation. In the presence of antisymmetry, the left Leibniz identity is equivalent to the [[Jacobi identity]], though this is not true in general; thus a Lie algebra is precisely an antisymmetric (or alternating) Leibniz algebra.

## Relation to Lie algebras in Loday-Pirashvili category

There is a remarkable obesrvation of Loday and Pirashvili that in the [[Lodayâ€“Pirashvili tensor category]] of linear maps with (exotic) "infinitesimal tensor product", the category of internal Lie algebras has the category of, say left, Leibniz $k$-algebras as a full subcategory.  

## Terminology

Some people dislike the term (left/right) Leibniz algebra (which is allegedly due to Loday), and prefer other names, including 'Loday algebras' and many longer descriptive names.
