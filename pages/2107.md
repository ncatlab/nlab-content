Given a commutative unital ring $k$ (usually a field), a Lebniz $k$-algebra $A$ is a particular class of [[nonassociative algebras]] which is somewhat wider than the class of [[Lie algebra|Lie $k$-algebras]].

A __left Leibniz $k$-algebra__ is $k$-module $L$ equipped with a bracket, which is a $k$-linear map $[,]:A\otimes A \to A$ satisfying the __left Leibniz identity__

$$ [a, [b,c]] = [[a,b],c]+[b,[a,c]] $$

In other words left ad-map, $a \mapsto (ad_l a = [a,-]:L\to L)$ is a [[derivation]] of $L$ as a nonassociative algebra. Similarly, there are right Leibniz algebras, for which the right ad-map $ad_r :a\mapsto [-,a]:L\to L$ is a derivation. In the presence of antisymmetry, the left Leibniz identity is equivalent to the Jacobi identity, though this is not true in general. There is a remarkable obesrvation of Loday and Pirashvili that in [[Loday-Pirashvili tensor category]] of linear maps with (exotic) "infinitesimal tensor product", the category of internal Lie algebras has the category of, say left, Leibniz $k$-algebras as its full subcategory. 

Loday introduced Leibniz algebras, because of considerations in algebraic K-theory which lead to a refinement of Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for Lie algebra homology: in a refinement, sort of noncommutative phenomena appeared with a new complex leading to so-called Leibniz homology. Some people dislike the term (left/right) Leibniz algebra (which is allegedly due Loday), and prefer other names, including 'Loday algebras' and many longer descriptive names.
