## Idea

The generalization of [[CW-approximation]] from plain [[homotopy theory]] to $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]] is called _$G$-CW approximation_:

For suitable [[equivariance groups]] $G$, every [[topological G-space]] $X$ receives a $G$-[[equivariant function]] $Q X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X$ from a [[G-CW complex]] $Q X$, such that this restricts to a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $f^H \;\colon (Q X)^H \to X^H$ on $H$-[[fixed loci]], for all suitable [[subgroups]] $H \subset G$.

This should hold for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] (such as a [[finite group]]) and $H$ ranging over its [[closed subspace|closed]] [[subgroups]].
