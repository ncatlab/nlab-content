## Idea

The **Wess-Zumino-Witten model** (or **WZW model** for short, also called  **Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten** model, or short **WZNW** model) is a 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] whose target space is a [[Lie group]].

This may be regarded as the boundary theory of [[Chern-Simons theory]] for Lie group $G$.

The [[vertex operator algebra]]s corresponding to the WZW model are [[current algebra]]s.

## Action functional
 {#ActionFunctional}

For $G$ a [[Lie group]], the [[configuration space]] of the WZW over a 2-[[dimension]]al [[manifold]] $\Sigma$ is the space of [[smooth function]]s $g : \Sigma \to G$.

The [[action functional]] of the WZW [[sigma-model]] is the sum of two terms, a kinetic term and a topological term

$$
  S_{WZW} = S_{kin} + S_{top}
  \,.
$$



### Kinetic term
 {#KineticTerm}

The Lie group canonically carries a [[Riemannian metric]] and the kinetic term is the standard one for [[sigma-model]]s on Riemannian [[target space]]s.


### Topological term -- WZW term
 {#TopologicalTerm}

Let $G$ be [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected space|simply connected]]. 

Then by [[infinity-Chern-Weil theory]] the [[Killing form]] [[invariant polynomial]] on the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ induces a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]] on the smooth [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ of $G$-[[principal bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]. 

$$
  CS_{\mathbf{c}} : \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

This is the [[Lagrangian]] for $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]]. By [[loop space object|looping]] this, including a differential twist, there is induced canonically a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] 

$$
  WZW_{\mathbf{c}} : G \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

The construction of the canonical morphism $WZW_{\mathbf{c}}$ goes as follows. Consider, inside $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ the substack $\mathbf{B}G_{\flat dR}$ of _trivialized_ principal $G$-bundles with _flat_ connections. The morphism $CS_{\mathbf{c}}$, restricted to $\mathbf{B}G_{\flat dR}$, factors as 

$$
\mathbf{B}G_{\flat dR}\to \Omega^3(-) \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
$$

where $\Omega^3(-)$ is identified with the 3-stack of trivialized circle bundles with connection whose connection form lives entirely in degree 3. Since $\mathbf{B}G_{\flat dR}\to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ factors through the stack $\flat\mathbf{B}G$ of principal $G$-bundles with flat conenctions, we have a homotopy commutative diagram

$$
\array{
\mathbf{B}G_{\flat dR}&\to^{CS_{\mathbf{c}}}& \Omega^3(-)\\
\downarrow && \downarrow\\
\flat\mathbf{B}G& \to & \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
}
$$ 

and so a canonically induced morphism $WZW_{\mathbf{c}}$ between the homotopy fibers over the distinguished points. Since we have homotopy pullbacks

$$
\array{
G&\to& \mathbf{B}G_{\flat dR}\\
\downarrow && \downarrow\\
{*}& \to & \flat\mathbf{B}G
}
$$ 

and

$$
\array{
\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}&\to & \Omega^3(-)\\
\downarrow && \downarrow\\
{*}& \to & \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
},
$$ 

the morphism $WZW_{\mathbf{c}}$ can naturally be seen as a morphism from $G$ (as a smooth manifold) to the 2-stack $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}$ of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundles with connection]]. In other words, if $G$ is a compact simply connected simple Lie group, the differential refinement $CS_{\mathbf{c}}$ of the degree 4 characteristic class $\mathbf{c}$ provided by Chern-Simons theory naturally induces a  circle 2-bundle with connection over the smooth manifold underlying the Lie group $G$.


The [[higher holonomy|surface holonomy]] of this is the topological part of the WZW action functional:

$$
  \exp(i S_{top}(g))
  = 
  hol_{\Sigma}( g^* WZW_{\mathbf{c}} )
  \,.
$$


## Properties
 {#Properties}

### Holography

By  the [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]] (see there for more details) the 2d WZW [[CFT]] on $G$ is related to $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] in $3d$.

### D-branes for the WZW model
 {#DBranes}

The characterization of [[D-brane]] [[submanifolds]] for the [[open string]] WZW model on a [[Lie group]] $G$ comes from two consistency conditions:

1. geometrical condition:

   For the open string [[CFT]] to still have [[current algebra]] [[worldsheet]] symmetry, hence for half the current algebra symmetry of the closed WZW string to be preserved, the [[D-brane]] [[submanifolds]] need to be [[conjugacy classes]] of the group manifold (see e.g. [Alekseev-Schomerus](#AlekseevSchomerus) for a brief review and further pointers). These conjugacy classes are therefore also called the **symmetric D-branes**.

   Notice that these conjugacy classes are equivalently the [[leaves]] of the [[foliation]] induced by the canonical [[Cartan-Dirac structure]] on $G$, hence (by the discussion at [[Dirac structure]]), the leaves induced by the  [[Lagrangian dg-submanifold|Lagrangian sub-Lie 2-algebroids]] of the [[Courant Lie 2-algebroid]]  which is the [[higher gauge groupoid]] (see there) of the background [[B-field]] on $G$.(It has been suggested by [[Chris Rogers]] that such a foliation be thought of as a higher real [[polarization]].) 

1. cohomological condition: 

   In order for the Kapustin-part of the [[Freed-Witten-Kapustin anomaly]] of the [[worldsheet]] [[action functional]] of the open WZW string to vanish, the D-brane must be equipped with a [[Chan-Paton gauge field]], hence a [[twisted unitary bundle]] ([[bundle gerbe module]]) of some rank $n \in \mathbb{N}$ for the restriction of the ambient [[B-field]] to the brane. 

   For [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] Lie groups only the rank-1 Chan-Paton gauge fields and their direct sums play a role, and their existence corresponds to a trivialization of the underlying $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-[[principal 2-bundle]] ($U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]]) of the restriction of the [[B-field]] to the brane. There is then a discrete finite collection of symmetric D-branes = [[conjugacy classes]] satisfying this condition, and these are called the **integral symmetric D-branes**. ([Alekseev-Schomerus](#AlekseevSchomerus), [Gawedzki-Reis](#GW)). As observed in [Alekseev-Schomerus](#AlekseevSchomerus), this may be thought of as identifying a D-brane as a variant kind of a [[Bohr-Sommerfeld leaf]].

   More generally, on non-simply connected group manifolds there are nontrivial higher rank [[twisted unitary bundles]]/[[Chan-Paton gauge fields]] over conjugacy classes and hence the cohomological "integrality" or "Bohr-Sommerfeld"-condition imposed on symmetric D-branes becomes more refined ([Gawedzki 04](#Gawedzki04)).

In summary, the [[D-brane]] [[submanifolds]] in a Lie group which induce an [[open string]] WZW model that a) has one [[current algebra]] symmetry and b) is [[Freed-Witten-Kapustin anomaly|Kapustin-anomaly]]-free are precisely the [[conjugacy class]]-submanifolds $G$ equipped with a [[twisted unitary bundle]] for the restriction of the background [[B-field]] to the conjugacy class.

A useful account of the WZW model that encompasses both its [[action functional]] and [[path integral]] quantization as well as the [[current algebra]] aspects of the QFT is in

* [[Krzysztof Gawedzki]], _Conformal field theory: a case study_ in Y. Nutku, C. Saclioglu, T. Turgut (eds.) _Frontier in Physics_ 102, Perseus Publishing (2000) ([hep-th/9904145](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9904145))

This starts in section 2 as a warmup with describing the 1d QFT of a particle propagating on a group manifold. The [[Hilbert space]] of [[states]] is expressed in terms of the [[Lie theory]] of $G$ and its [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$.

In section 4 the [[quantization]] of the 2d WZW model is discussed in analogy to that. In lack of a full formalization of the quantization procedure, the author uses the loop algebra $\mathcal{l} \mathfrak{g}$ --  the [[affine Lie algebra]] -- of $\mathfrak{g}$ as the evident analog that replaces $\mathfrak{g}$ and discusses the [[Hilbert space]] [[space of states|of states]] in terms of that. He also indicates how this may be understood as a space of [[sections]] of a ([[prequantum line bundle|prequantum]]) [[line bundle]] over the [[loop group]].

### D-branes for the WZW model
 {#ReferencesDBranes}

A characterization of [[D-branes]] in the WZW model as those [[conjugacy classes]] that in addition satisfy an integrality ([[Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization|Bohr-Sommerfeld]]-type) condition missed in other parts of the literature is stated in 

* [[Anton Alekseev]], [[Volker Schomerus]], _D-branes in the WZW model_, Phys.Rev.D60:061901,1999 ([arXiv:hep-th/9812193v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9812193v2))
 {#AlekseevSchomerus}

The refined interpretation of the integrality condition as a choice of trivialization of the underling [[principal 2-bundle]]/[[bundle gerbe]] of the [[B-field]] over the brane was then noticed in section 7 of 

* [[Krzysztof Gawedzki]], Nuno Reis, _WZW branes and gerbes_, Rev.Math.Phys. 14 (2002) 1281-1334 ([arXiv:hep-th/0205233](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0205233))

The observation that this is just the special rank-1 case of the more general structure provided by a [[twisted unitary bundle]] of some rank $n$ on the D-brane ([[gerbe module]]) which is twisted by the restriction of the [[B-field]] to the D-brane -- the [[Chan-Paton gauge field]] --  is due to

* [[Krzysztof Gawedzki]], _Abelian and non-Abelian branes in WZW models and gerbes_, Commun.Math.Phys. 258 (2005) 23-73 ([arXiv:hep-th/0406072](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0406072)).
 {#Gawedzki04}

The observation that the "multiplicative" structure of the WZW-[[B-field]] (induced from it being the [[transgression]] of the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle|Chern-Simons circle 3-connection]] over the [[moduli stack]] of $G$-[[principal connections]]) induces the [[Verlinde ring]] fusion product structure on symmetric D-branes equipped with [[Chan-Paton gauge fields]] is discussed in 

* [[Alan Carey]], [[Bai-Ling Wang]], _Fusion of symmetric $D$-branes and Verlinde rings_, Commun. Math. Phys.277:577-625 (2008) ([arXiv:math-ph/0505040](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0505040))

The image in [[K-theory]] of these [[Chan-Paton gauge fields]] over conjugacy classes is shown to generate the [[Verlinde ring]]/the [[positive energy representations]] of the [[loop group]] in 

* [[Eckhard Meinrenken]], _On the quantization of conjugacy classes_,  	Enseign. Math. (2) 55 (2009), no. 1-2, 33-75 ([arXiv:0707.3963](http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3963))


### Relation to dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons

One can also obtain the WZW-model by [[KK-reduction]]
from [[Chern-Simons theory]].

Relation to [[extended TQFT]] is discussed in 

* [[Dan Freed]], _[[4-3-2 8-7-6]]_

The formulation of the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] for [[superstrings]] (and other [[branes]] of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]]) as WZW-models (and [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory|∞-WZW models]]) on ([[super L-∞ algebra]] [[L-∞ extensions]] of) the [[super translation group]] is in 

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:The brane bouquet|Super Lie n-algebra extensions, higher WZW models and super p-branes with tensor multiplet fields]]_


## Discussion

Would someone translate the Topological term for an aging algebraic topologist? B^3U(1) aka K(Z,3) or is it 4? sub conn denotes the classifying space for bundles with connection? The morphism from G to B^2 is strict or up to homotopy?
