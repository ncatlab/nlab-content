There are two notions: cofinite subset of a set and a cofinite subset of a (pre)ordered set.

## Definition

Given a [[set]] $X$, then a [[subset]] $S \subset X$ is called _cofinite_ if the [[complement]] $X \backslash S$ is a [[finite set]].

A [[preordered set]] $(\Lambda,\leq)$ is _cofinite_ or closure finite if for every 
$\lambda\in\Lambda$ the set of all predecessors of $\lambda$ is finite.
