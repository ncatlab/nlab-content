## Idea

The term 'Lebesgue space' can stand for two distinct notions: one is the general notion of [[measure space]] (compare the [Springer Encyclopaedia of Mathematics](http://eom.springer.de/L/l057910.htm)) and another is the notion of $L_p$ space (or $L^p$ space).  Here we discuss the latter.


## Definitions

If $1 \leq p \lt \infty$ is a [[real number]] and $(\Omega,\mu)$ is a [[measure space]], one considers the **$L_p$ space** $L_p = L_p(\Omega)$ of (equivalence classes of) [[measurable function|measurable]] (complex- or real-valued) functions $f\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{K}$ whose (absolute values of) $p$th powers are integrable; i.e. whose [[norm]] 

$$ {\|f\|}_p = \left(\int_\Omega {|f|}^p \,d\mu\right)^{1/p} $$

is finite.

The $L_p$ spaces are examples of [[Banach spaces]]; they are continuous analogues of $l_p$ spaces of $p$-summable series. (Indeed, $l_p(S)$, for $S$ a [[set]], is simply $L_p(S)$ if $S$ is equipped with [[counting measure]].)

For fixed $f$, the norm ${\|f\|}_p$ is continuous in $p$.  Accordingly, for $p = \infty$, one may take the limit of ${\|f\|}_p$ as $p \to \infty$.  However, this turns out to be the same as the [[essential supremum]] norm $\|f\|_\infty$.  Therefore, $L^\infty(\Omega)$ makes sense as long as $\Omega$ is a [[measurable space]] equipped with a family of [[null sets]] (or [[full sets]]); the measure $\mu$ is otherwise irrelevant.

For $0 \lt p \lt 1$, we can define the $L^p$ space using the same formula; however, it is no longer a Banach space (but still an [[F-space]]).  For $p = 0$, we can again take the limit, or equivalently use the essential infimum; every measurable function belongs to $L^0$.

## Minkowski's inequality 

We offer here a proof that $\vert f \vert_p$ defines a norm in the case $1 \lt p \lt \infty$ (the cases $p = 1$ and $p = \infty$ are easy). The most usual textbook proofs involve a clever application of H&ouml;lder's inequality; the following proof is more straightforwardly geometric. All functions $f$ are assumed to be complex-valued.

######Theorem 
Suppose $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and suppose $X$ is a measure space with measure $\mu$. Then the function $|(-)|_p: L^p(X, \mu) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by  
$$|f|_p \coloneqq (\int_X |f|^p d\mu)^{1/p}$$ 
defines a [[norm]]. 
=-- 

One must verify three things: 

1. Separation axiom: $|f|_p = 0$ implies $f = 0$. 

1. Scaling axiom: $|t f|_p = |t| \cdot |f|_p$. 

1. Triangle inequality: $|f + g|_p \leq |f|_p + |g|_p$. 

The first two properties are obvious, so it remains to prove the last, which is also called _Minkowski's inequality_. 

The proof of Minkowski's inequality is broken down into a series of simple lemmas. The plan is to boil down the triangle inequality for $|f|_p$ to two things: the scaling axiom, and convexity of the function $x \mapsto |x|^p$ (as a function from complex numbers to real numbers). 

First, some generalities. Let $V$ be a complex vector space equipped with a function $\|(-)\|: V \to [0, \infty]$ that satisfies the scaling axiom: $\|\alpha v\| = |\alpha| \cdot \|v\|$ for all complex scalars $\alpha$, and the separation axiom: $\|v\| = 0$ implies $v = 0$. As usual, we define the unit ball in $V$ to be $\{v \in V: \|v\| \leq 1\}.$ 

+-- {: .un_lem}
######Lemma 1
Given that the scaling and separation axioms hold, the following conditions are equivalent: 
1. The triangle inequality is satisfied. 
1. The unit ball is convex. 
1. If $\|u\| = \|v\| = 1$, then $\|t u + (1-t)v\| \leq 1$ for all $t \in [0, 1]$.  
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof 
Condition 1. implies condition 2. easily: if $v$ and $v$ are in the unit ball and $0 \leq t \leq 1$, we have 
$$\array{
\|t u + (1-t)v\| & \leq & \|t u\| + \|(1-t)v\| \\
 & = & t \|u\| + (1-t) \|v\| \\
 & \leq & t + (1-t) = 1.}$$ 
Now 2. implies 3. trivially, so it remains to prove that 3. implies 1. Suppose $\|v\|, \|v'\| \in (0, \infty)$. Let $u = \frac{v}{\|v\|}$ and $u' = \frac{v'}{\|v'\|}$ be the associated unit vectors. 
Then 
$$\array{
\frac{v + v'}{\|v\|+\|v'\|} & = & (\frac{\|v\|}{\|v\|+\|v'\|})\frac{v}{\|v\|} + (\frac{\|v'\|}{\|v\|+\|v'\|})\frac{v'}{\|v'\|} \\
 & = & t u + (1-t)u'}$$ 
where $t = \frac{\|v\|}{\|v\| + \|v'\|}$. If condition 3. holds, then 
$$\|t u + (1-t)u'\| \leq 1$$ 
but by the scaling axiom, this is the same as saying 
$$\frac{\|v + v'\|}{\|v\| + \|v'\|} \leq 1$$ 
which is the triangle inequality. 
=-- 

Consider now $L^p$ with its $p$-norm $\|f\| = |f|_p$. Minkowski's inequality clearly holds for $p=1$ and $p = \infty$, so we concentrate on the case where $1 \lt p \lt \infty$. By lemma 1, this inequality is equivalent to 

* **Condition 4:** If $|u|_{p}^{p} = 1$ and $|v|_{p}^{p} = 1$, then $|t u + (1-t)v|_{p}^{p} \leq 1$ whenever $0 \leq t \leq 1$. 

This allows us to remove the cumbersome exponent $1/p$ in the definition of $p$-norm. 

The next two lemmas may be proven by elementary calculus; we omit the proofs. (But see [here](http://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/p-norms) for full details.)

######Lemma 2 
Let $\alpha, \beta$ be two complex numbers, and define 
$$\gamma(t) = |\alpha + \beta t|^p$$ 
for _real_ $t$. Then $\gamma''(t)$ is nonnegative. 
=-- 

+-- {: .un_lem}
######Lemma 3
Define $\phi: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\phi(x) = |x|^p$.  Then $\phi$ is convex, i.e., for all $x, y$, 
$$|t x + (1-t)y|^p \leq t|x|^p + (1-t)|y|^p$$ 
for all $t \in [0, 1]$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof of Minkowski's inequality   
Let $u$ and $v$ be unit vectors in $L^p$. By condition 4, it suffices to show that $|t u + (1-t)v|_p \leq 1$ for all $t \in [0, 1]$. But 
$$\int_X |t u + (1-t)v|^p d\mu \leq \int_X t|u|^p + (1-t)|v|^p d\mu$$ 
by lemma 3. Using $\int |u|^p = 1 = \int |v|^p$, we are done.
