## Idea

The term 'Lebesgue space' can stand for two distinct notions: one is the general notion of [[measure space]] (compare the [Springer Encyclopaedia of Mathematics](http://eom.springer.de/L/l057910.htm)) and another is the notion of $L_p$ space (or $L^p$ space).  Here we discuss the latter.


## Definitions

If $1 \leq p \lt \infty$ is a [[real number]] and $(\Omega,\mu)$ is a [[measure space]], one considers the **$L_p$ space** $L_p = L_p(\Omega)$ of (equivalence classes of) [[measurable function|measurable]] (complex- or real-valued) functions $f\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{K}$ whose (absolute values of) $p$th powers are integrable; i.e. whose norm 

$$ {\|f\|}_p = \left(\int_\Omega {|f|}^p \,d\mu\right)^{1/p} $$

is finite.

The $L_p$ spaces are examples of [[Banach spaces]]; they are continuous analogues of $l_p$ spaces of $p$-summable series. (Indeed, $l_p(S)$, for $S$ a [[set]], is simply $L_p(S)$ if $S$ is equipped with [[counting measure]].)

For fixed $f$, the norm ${\|f\|}_p$ is continuous in $p$.  Accordingly, for $p = \infty$, one may take the limit of ${\|f\|}_p$ as $p \to \infty$.  However, this turns out to be the same as the [[essential supremum]] norm $\|f\|_\infty$.  Therefore, $L^\infty(\Omega)$ makes sense as long as $\Omega$ is a [[measurable space]] equipped with a family of [[null sets]] (or [[full sets]]); the measure $\mu$ is otherwise irrelevant.
