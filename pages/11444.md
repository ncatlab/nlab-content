## Idea

What is called _$MR$ cohomology theory_ or _real cobordism_ ([Landweber 68](#Landweber68), [Landweber 69](#Landweber69)) is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology theory]] version of [[complex cobordism]] $MU$. 

There is an evident [[action]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ on [[formal group laws]] given by negation in the formal group, and this lifts to an [[involution|involutive]] [[automorphism]] $MU \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} MU$ of the [[spectrum]] [[MU]]. This induces an $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant spectrum]] $M\mathbb{R}$, and real cobordism is the [[cohomology theory]] that it [[Brown representability theorem|represents]].  This is directly analogous to how [[complex K-theory]] [[KU]] gives $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant [[KR-theory]], both are examples of _[[real-oriented cohomology theories]]_.
