## Definition

An [[affine connection]] $\nabla$ on a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$ is a **symplectic connection** if the [[symplectic form]] is [[covariant derivative|covariantly constant]] with respect to the connection, $\nabla \omega = 0$.

## Applications

### In deformation quantization

The second order term in the [[formal deformation quantization]] (see there) of a symplectic manifold is closely related to symplectic connections.
