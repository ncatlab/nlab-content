# Idea #

The plain [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] establishes an equivalence between (co)simplicial groups and (co)chain complexes.

Both these categories carry natural [[monoidal category]] structures. It turns out that the Dold-Kan correspondence does respect this monoidal structure, either strictly or in their suitable [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] sense.

# General discussion #

Notice that 

* monoids in the [[category of chain complexes]] are [[differential graded ring]]s

* monoids in the category of simplicial abelian groups are [[simplicial object|simplicial]] [[ring]]s.

If instead we look at chain complexes and [[simplicial object]]s not in [[Ab]] but in [[Vect]] then

* monoids in the [[category of chain complexes]] of vector spaces are [[differential graded algebra]]s

* monoids in the category of simplicial vector spaces are simplicial algebras.

Analogous statements apply to the dual Dod-Kan correspondence, where the monoids in question are accordingly cosimplicial rings and [[differential graded algebras]] with differential of positiuve degree.

A crucial fact about the Dold-Kan correspondence is that

* The Dold-Kan correspondence respects these monoidal structures.

But it doesn't in general do so _strictly_, except in one direction.

The Dold-Kan correspondence (using the normalized chain complex functor) is in one direction [[monoidal category|monoidal]] in the naive (strict, 1-categorical) way, whereas in the other direction it is monoidal only in the expect homotopical sense.

###### Lemma

The [[Moore complex]] functor

$$
  C_\bullet : sAb \to Ch_+
$$

as well as the normalized [[Moore complex]] functor

$$
  N_\bullet : sAb \to Ch_+
$$

is a [[monoidal category|symmetric lax monoidal functor]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof can be found in 

* Weibel, _An introduction to homological algebra_, section 8.5.4

The _[[lax monoidal transformation]]_ that exhibits the lax-monoidalness of the Moore chain complex functor is the [[shuffle map]]. Its component 

$$
  \nabla_{A,B} : (N_\bullet A) \otimes (N_\bullet B))
$$

on a pair $A,B$ of simplicial abelian groups is the morphism of [[chain complex]]es that sends homogeneous elements $a_p\otimes b_q \in A_p \otimes B_q =: C_p(A) \otimes C_q(B)$ to

$$
  \nabla_{A,B}(a \otimes B)
  =
  \sum_{(\mu,\nu)}  sign(\mu,\nu) (s_\nu a) \otimes s_\mu(b) 
  \in
  C_{p+q}(A \otimes B) = A_{p+q}\otimes B_{p+q}  
  \,.
$$

Here the sum is over all $(p,q)$-shuffles, i.e. permutation \{\mu_1, \dots, \mu_p, \nu_1, \cdots, \nu_q\} of the set $\{0,1,\cdots,p+q-1\}$ that leave the first $p$ and the last $q$ elements in their natural order.

The sign in the above sum is the corresponding sign of this permutation and the degeneracy maps $s_\mu$ and $s_\nu$ denote the maps

$$
  s_\mu := s_{\mu_p} \cdots \circ s_{\mu_1}
$$

and similarly for $s_\nu$

>(Hm, is that consistent?)

While the nerve functor $\Xi : Ch_+ \to sAb$ fails to be monoidal in such a direct way, it turns out to be monoidal in a suitable [[higher category theory|higher categorical]], i.e. [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] way.
This is the content of the following statements.


In **characteristic zero** there is also a Dold--Kan correspondence between simplicial algebras and [[dg-algebra]]s in nonnegative degrees, as well as between cosimplicial algebras and dg-algebras in nonpositive degrees, which is rather a [[Quillen equivalence]] (thus the two adjoint functors constructed in that case are inverses up to a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of dg-algebras):

Cosimplicial versus DG-rings: a version of the Dold-Kan correspondence, J. Pure Appl. Algebra  191  (2004),  no. 1-2, 119--142, [arXiv:math.KT/0306289](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0306289).

Further work along such lines is

* Birgit Richter, _Symmetry properties of the Dold-Kan correspondence_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/richter/doldkan.pdf))

This shows that the Dold-Kan map from Chain complexes to simplicial abelian groups is, while not a [[monoidal category|monoidal functor]], an $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-monoidal functor|monoidal functor]].

This implies that generalized [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]] on [[differential graded algebra|differential graded commutative algebras]] are $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-monoid|monoids]] in the category of $H \mathbb{Z}$-[[module]] [[spectrum|spectra]].

* Birgit Richter, _Homotopy algebras and the inverse of the normalization functor_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/richter/invjpaa.pdf))

This article shows that the inverse $\Xi$ from chain complexes to simplicial abelian groups sends algebras over arbitrary differential graded $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-operad|operads]] to $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-algebra|algebras]] in simplicial modules, and is part of a [[Quillen adjunction]] for these.


# Lax monoidalness of the Moore cochain complex functor #

+-- {: .standout}

We claim to show that the [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex functor]]

$$
  C : CoS(Ab) \to Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)
$$

from cosimplicial abelian groups to cochain complexes is a  [[lax monoidal functor]] with respect to the standard monoidal structures on $CoS(Ab)$ and $Ch_+^\bullet(An)$.

=--


This implies in particular that for every [[monoid]] $K$ in $CoS(An)$ -- a  cosimplicial ring --  the Moore cochain complex $C(K)$ is naturally equipped with the structure of a [[monoid]] in $Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)$ -- a [[differential graded algebra]] -- by letting the product $\smile : C(K)\otimes C(K) \to C(K)$ be given by the composite

$$
  \smile : C(K)\otimes C(K) \stackrel{\mu_{K,K}}{\to} C(K \otimes K) \stackrel{C(-\cdot -)}{\to} C(K)
$$

where 

* $\mu_{K,K}$ is the component of the [[lax monoidal transformation]] that exhibits the lax monoidal structure (the "compositor"); 

* The operation $-\cdot - : K \otimes K \to K$ is the product on $K$.

+-- {: .standout}


This monoidal structure induced from a cosimplicial ring $K$ on its Moore cochain complex on $C(K)$ is the [[cup product]]. 

=--


More precisely, for $X$ a [[topological space]] and $X^{\Delta^n_{Top}}$ the set of $n$-[[simplex|simplices]] in $X$, arranging themselves into the [[simplicial set]] $\Pi(X) = X^{\Delta^\bullet_{Top}}$ -- the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$ -- and for $R$ some [[ring]] let $Maps(\Pi(X),R)$ be the cosimplicial ring of maps $X^{\Delta^n_{Top}} \to R$. 

Then 

* the Moore cochain complex $C(Maps(\Pi(X),R))$ is the cochain complex that computes the [[singular cohomology]] of $X$;

* the monoid structure induced on $C(Maps(\Pi(X),R))$ by the lax monoidalness of the Moore cochain complex functor is the familiar [[cup product]] on [[singular cohomology]].

We now derive this in detail.

For $A$ some [[abelian category]] write
$CoS(A)$ for the category of [[simplicial object|cosimplicial object]]s
in $A$ and $Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)$ for the 
[[category of chain complexes|category of cochain complexes]] in $A$
concentrated in non-negative degree -- called connective or $\mathbb{N}$-graded 
cochain complexes.

Recall that the [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex]] functor

$$
  C : CoS(A) \to Ch_+^\bullet(A)
$$

is an [[equivalence of categories]]. This is the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].

For $A = $ [[Ab]] with its standard [[monoidal category]] structure $(A,\otimes)$,
there are standard [[monoidal category]]
structures $(CoS(A), \otimes)$ and $(Ch_+^\bullet(X), \otimes)$:

* for $K,L \in CoS(A)$ their [[tensor product]] $K \otimes L$ is the
_degreewise tensor product_, i.e. the cosimplicial object with 
$(K \otimes L)^n = K^n \otimes L^n$ and with cosimplicial maps the
tensor product of the cosimplicial maps in $K$ and $L$.

* for $V,W \in Ch_+^\bullet(A)$ their [[tensor product]] $V \otimes W$
the _graded tensor product_, i.e. the cochain complex with
$(V \otimes W)^n = \oplus_{p+q = n} V^p \otimes W^q$ whose
coboundary map is given on homogeneous elements 
$\nu \otimes \omega\in V^p \otimes W^q$ by
  $$
    d (\nu \otimes \omega) = (d_V \nu) \otimes \omega + (-)^{p} \vu \otimes d_W \omega
    \,.
  $$

With respect to these standard monoidal  structures
the [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex]] functor $C : CoS(A) \to Ch_+^\bullet(A)$
becomes a [[lax monoidal functor]] with the following lax monoidal 
[[natural transformation]] map 
$\mu : C(-) \otimes C(-) \to C(-\otimes -) : CoS(A) \times CoS(A) \to Ch_+^\bullet(A)$ .

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (lax monoidal structure on Moore cochain complex functor)

For $K,L \in CoS(A)$ define the component map

$$
  \mu_{K,L} : C(K)\otimes C(L) \to C(K \otimes L)
$$
 
by defining it on homogeneous elements 

$a\otimes b \in C^p(K)\otimes C^q(L) \subset (C(K)\otimes C(L))^{p+k}$ by

$$
  \mu_{K,L} : a\otimes b \mapsto (d_{p+1})^p a) \otimes 
   ((d_0)^q b) =: a \smile b
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

The iterated application of cosimplicial face maps on the right is to be thought of as producing a $(p+q)$-cosimplex in  $C(K \otimes L)^{p+q} = K^{p+q}\otimes L^{p+q}$ by 
evaluating the $p$-cosimplex $a$ on "leftmost" simplicial $p$-faces 
and the $q$-simplex $b$ on "rightmost" simplicial $q$-faces and then 
tensoring the resulting group elements.

=--


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

The $\mu_{K,L}$ defined this is indeed a cochain map.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have to check that $\mu$ respect the coboundary maps in that for all $a,b$ as above we have

$$
  d \circ \mu (a \otimes b) = \mu \circ d (a \otimes b)
  \,.
$$

By definition of the cup product and the differential on the 
Moore cochain complex we have
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d \circ \mu (a \otimes b)
    &=
    d (a \smile b) 
    \\
    &= d ( ((d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes ((d_0)^p b) )
    \\
    &=
    \sum_{i=0}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  d_i((d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes ((d_0)^p b)     
  \end{aligned}
$$

By definition the face maps on the tensor product $K \otimes L$
are just the tensor products of the face maps of $K$ and $L$, so that this is

$$  
    \cdots
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  (d_i (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_i (d_0)^p b) 
    \,.
$$

Break up this sum in three parts

$$
    \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  (d_i (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_i (d_0)^p b)     
    +
    (-1)^{p+1}  (d_{p+1} (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_{p+1} (d_0)^p b)     
    +
    \sum_{i=p+2}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  (d_i (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_i (d_0)^p b)     
$$

Now repeatedly use the [[simplicial identities]] for face maps

$$
   (i \lt j) \;\;\Rightarrow \;\; d_i \circ d_j = d_j \circ d_{i-1}
$$

to pass face maps from the left to the right. This yields

$$
    \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^{p+1}  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_1 b)     
    +
    \sum_{i=p+2}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i-p}b)         
    \,.
$$
Observe that the second term may now be naturally included in the
sum in the third term, leaving two sums

$$
  \cdots =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    \sum_{i=p+1}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i-p}b)             
    \,.
$$

Reduce the summation index on the second sum by $p$ to obtain

$$
  \cdots =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^p
    \sum_{i=1}^{q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i}b)             
    \,.
$$

Each sum seperately is now almost the alternating sum expression of an application
of the Moore complex coboundary map, except for one missing term in each sum.
But the two missing terms are equal and of opposite sign, so we can add them in

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  \cdots 
  =&
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^{p+1}  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_{p+1} a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    \\
    &
    +
    (-1)^{p}  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_{p+1} a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^p
    \sum_{i=1}^{q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i}b)             
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

One last application of the simplicial identities in the third tirm shows that
indeed this is the missing term in the sum in the fourth term. 
Comparing the result with the definition of coboundary map and cup product
we find finally

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \cdots &= (d a) \smile b + (-1)^p a \smile (d b) 
    \\
    &=
    \mu \circ d (a \otimes b)
   \end{aligned}
    \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

This $\mu$ is indeed natural in $K,L$. For every $f : K \to K'$ and $g : L\to L'$ we have

$$
  \array{
    C(K) \otimes C(L) &\stackrel{\mu_{K,L}}{\to}& C(K \otimes L)
    \\
    \;\;\;\downarrow^{C(f)\otimes C(g)} && \;\;\;\downarrow^{C(f \otimes g)}
    \\
    C(K') \otimes C(L') &\stackrel{\mu_{K',L'}}{\to}& C(K' \otimes L')    
  }
$$

###### Proof


This is immediate from the fact that the morphisms $f, g$ of cosimplicial objects respect the face maps.

###### Proposition

The natural transformation $\mu$ is indeed a lax monoidal transformation
in that it is associative and unital in the required sense.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that for all $J,K,L \in CoS(A)$ we have

$$
 \array{
  C(J) \otimes C(K) \otimes C(L) &\stackrel{Id_{C(J)} \otimes \mu_{K,L}}{\to}&
  C(J)\otimes C(K \otimes L)
  \\

  \\
  C(J \otimes K) \otimes C(L)
  &\stackrel{\mu_{J,K} \otimes Id_{C(L)}}{\to}&
  C(J\otimes K \otimes L)
 }
  \,.
$$

it is sufficient to check this on all homogeneous elements
$a \otimes b \otimes c \in C^o(J)\otimes C^p(K) \otimes C^q(L)$.
There it is straightforward to check by using simplicial identities.

###### Remark


The above statement is obvious when one observes the geometric  interpretation of the above remark: the image of $a \otimes b \otimes c$
along both ways around the above square is the $o+p+q$-dimensional
cosimplex that is obtained by evaluating $a$ on the leftmost $o$-face,
$p$ on the middle $p$-face and $q$ on the rightmost $q$-face and then
tensoring the resulting group elements.
