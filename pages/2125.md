## Idea

The _monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence_ relates [[simplicial algebra]]s with [[differential graded algebra]]s.

There is a plain [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], which establishes an equivalence between (co)[[simplicial group]]s and (co)[[chain complex]]es.
Both these categories carry natural [[monoidal category]] structures. It turns out that the Dold-Kan correspondence does respect this monoidal structure, to some extent strictly, but generally in the sense of [[homotopy theory]] and  [[higher category theory]].

This way it extends to a [[Quillen equivalence]] between [[model categories]] of _[[monoids]]_ in simplicial groups -- [[simplicial ring]]s -- and monoids in chain complexes -- [[dg-algebra]]s. 


Notice that 

* monoids in the [[category of chain complexes]] are [[differential graded ring]]s

* monoids in the category of simplicial abelian groups are [[simplicial object|simplicial]] [[ring]]s.

If instead we look at chain complexes and [[simplicial object]]s not in [[Ab]] but in [[Vect]] then

* monoids in the [[category of chain complexes]] of vector spaces are [[differential graded algebra]]s

* monoids in the category of simplicial vector spaces are simplicial algebras.

Analogous statements apply to the dual Dod-Kan correspondence, where the monoids in question are accordingly cosimplicial rings and [[differential graded algebras]] with differential of positive degree.

A crucial fact about the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] is that

* The two functors in the Dold-Kan correspondence individually respect these monoidal structures, in the sense that they are lax [[monoidal functors]].

However, the [[adjunction]] fails to be a [[monoidal adjunction]] of any sort (i.e. the unit and counit are not monoidal natural transformations).  (Note that if it were a monoidal adjunction, then by [[doctrinal adjunction]], both functors would necessarily be strong monoidal, and hence an equivalence of monoidal categories.)  As a result, the Dold-Kan equivalence of categories does not induce an [[equivalence of categories]] or even an adjunction between (co)simplicial rings and (co)chain complexes.

There are two different versions of the monoidal Dold-Kan corespondence, which are almost but apparently not entirely formal duals of each other (at least not in the detailed constructions):

* the **simplicial version** that relates [[monoid]]s in abelian [[simplicial group]]s (simplicial rings)  to monoids in [[chain complex]]es (chain [[dg-algebra]]s),

* the **cosimplicial version** that relates monoids in cosimplicial groups ([[cosimplicial algebra|cosimplicial ring]]) to monoidal in co-chain complexes (cochain [[dg-algebra]]s).

The cosimplicial version is made monoidal by replacing the the Moore complex functor by something else, to obtain a [[Quillen equivalence]].
The simplicial version is made monoidal by replacing the other functor by something else.


## Summary of Quillen equivalences {#Summary}

Below we discuss the following [[Quillen equivalence]]s that capture various aspects of the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence.

* $(\Gamma \dashv N) : sAb \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} Ch_\bullet^+$

  as well as

  $(N \dashv \Gamma) : Ch_\bullet^+ \stackrel{\overset{N}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} sAb $   

  between simplicial abelian groups and connective chain complexes;


*  $(\Gamma^{cmon} \dashv N) : CAlg_k^{\Delta^{op}} \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} CdgAlg_{k}^{conn}$

   between connected commutative simplicial algebras and connected commutative dg-algebras over a field of characteristic 0

*  $(\Gamma^{mon} \dashv N) : Alg_k^{\Delta^{op}} \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma^{mon}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} dgAlg_{k}$

   as well as

    $(N^{mon} \dashv \Gamma) : dgAlg_{k}\stackrel{\overset{N^{mon}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} Alg_k^{\Delta^{op}} $

   between simplicial algebras and connective dg-algebras (neither necessarily commutative) over a commutative ring $k$


*  $ (\Gamma^{mon} \dashv N) : dgRing \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma^{mon}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}  Ring^{\Delta}$

   between connective cochain dg-rings and cosimplicial rings


*  $(\Gamma^{mon} \dashv N) : Alg_A^{\Delta^{op}} \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma^{mon}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} dgAlg_{N(A)}$

   between simplicial algebras and connective dg-algebras (neither necessarily commutative) over a commutative simplicial ring $A$ and its normalized dg-ring $N(A)$

*  $(\Gamma^{E_\infty} \dashv N) : E_\infty Alg_k^{\Delta^{op}} \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma^{E_\infty}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} 
   E_\infty dgAlg_{k}$

   between $E_\infty$ simplicial algebras and connective $E_\infty$ dg-algebras over a ring $k$ in any characteristic   


## Simplicial algebras and chain dg-algebras {#simplicial}

We first discuss the extent to which the [[Moore complex]] functor is monoidal. Then we use this to discuss various Quillen equivalences on model categories of monoids that it induces.


### Bilax monoidal Frobenius structure on normalized chains {#BilaxFrobStruc}


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[Moore complex]] functor

$$
  C_\bullet : sAb \to Ch_\bullet^+
$$

as well as the normalized chains/normalized Moore complex functor

$$
  N_\bullet : sAb \to Ch_\bullet^+
$$

are both

* [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric]] [[lax monoidal functors]] 

* [[oplax monoidal functors]] 

  (but *not* oplax *symmetric* monoidal)

* [[bilax monoidal functors]]

* [[Frobenius monoidal functors]].  

The lax structure is given by the [[Alexander-Whitney map]]

$$
  \nabla_{A,B} : N(A) \otimes N(B) \to N(A \otimes B)
  \,.
$$

The oplax structure is given by the [[Eilenberg-Zilber map]]

$$
  \Delta_{A,B} : N(A \otimes B ) \to N(A) \otimes N(B)
  \,.
$$

The composite 

$$
  N(A) \otimes N(B) \stackrel{\nabla_{A,B}}{\to}
  N(A \otimes B)
  \stackrel{\Delta_{A,B}}{\to}
  N(A) \otimes N(B)
$$

is the [[identity]], while the composite

$$
  N(A \otimes B)
  \stackrel{\Delta_{A,B}}{\to}
  N(A) \otimes N(B)
   \stackrel{\nabla_{A,B}}{\to}
  N(A \otimes B)
$$

is a chain [[homotopy equivalence]].


=--

Apparently the basic result (without the bilax and Frobenius structure)  appears in ([MacLaneHomology](#MacLaneHomology)).   The AW/EZ equivalences for the normalized chains functor are a special case of the strong deformation retract of chain complexes that was constructed in ([EilenbergMacLane](#EilenbergMacLane)).  A review of the proof of symmetric lax monoidalness can be found also in section 8.5.4 of ([Weibel](#Weibel)).
The bilax monoidal and Frobenius structure is described in chapter 5 of ([AguiarMahajan](#AguiarMahajan)). The Frobenius structure has also been observed independently by [[Kathryn Hess]] and [[Steve Lack]].
See also section 2.3 of ([SchwedeShipley](#SchwedeShipley)).



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The lax monoidal transformation that exhibits the lax-monoidalness of the Moore chain complex functor is the [[shuffle map]]. Its component 

$$
  \nabla_{A,B} : (N_\bullet A) \otimes (N_\bullet B))
  \to N_\bullet (A \otimes B)
$$

on a pair $A,B$ of simplicial abelian groups is the morphism of [[chain complex]]es that sends homogeneous elements $a_p\otimes b_q \in A_p \otimes B_q =: C_p(A) \otimes C_q(B)$ to

$$
  \nabla_{A,B}(a \otimes B)
  =
  \sum_{(\mu,\nu)}  sign(\mu,\nu) (s_\nu a) \otimes s_\mu(b) 
  \in
  C_{p+q}(A \otimes B) = A_{p+q}\otimes B_{p+q}  
  \,.
$$

Here the sum is over all $(p,q)$-shuffles, i.e. permutation $\{\mu_1, \dots, \mu_p, \nu_1, \cdots, \nu_q\}$ of the set $\{0,1,\cdots,p+q-1\}$ that leave the first $p$ and the last $q$ elements in their natural order.

The sign in the above sum is the corresponding sign of this permutation and the degeneracy maps $s_\mu$ and $s_\nu$ denote the maps

$$
  s_\mu := s_{\mu_p} \cdots \circ s_{\mu_1}
$$

and similarly for $s_\nu$

>(Hm, is that consistent?)

=--


+-- {: .un_corollary }
###### Corollary

Since the normalized Moore complex functor $N_\bullet$ is an equivalence of categories, by [[doctrinal adjunction]] its inverse nerve functor $\Gamma : Ch_+ \to sAb$ also acquires a lax monoidal and a oplax symmetric monoidal structure.  

=--

For more details see [[oplax monoidal functor]].

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

The upshot is that $N$ and $G$ are both pretty close to being [[strong monoidal functor]]s, but fail to be so. If they were, the monoidal 
Dold-Kan correspondence would be a simple corollary of the Dold-Kan correspondence and would hold at the level of 1-categories.

Explicitly, the failure of $N$ to be strong monoidal is in that 
the [[Eilenberg-Zilber map]] is (on normalized chain complexes) a [[right inverse]] to the [[Alexander-Whitney map]], but not a [[left inverse]]. But it _is_ a homotopy-inverse: because the components of the [[Alexander-Whitney map]] are (as discussed there) [[quasi-isomorphism]]s. By [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]] it follows that also the EZ-maps are quasi-isomorphisms and that these are indeed inverse to the AW map in the [[homotopy category]] of chain complexes (the [[derived category]]).

Therefore we expect that the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence holds, while not necessarily at the level of ordinary categories, at least at the level of [[homotopical categories]]. This is indeed the case, as discussed below.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark


Note that 

* the oplax structure of $N$ 

* and the lax structure of $\Gamma$ 

are not [[symmetric monoidal functor]]s, i.e. they do not respect the [[symmetric monoidal category]] structure.  However, this, toos, they do respect up to [[homotopy]], i.e. they are [[E-k-operad|E-infinity monoidal functors]] in a suitable sense.  This is shown in ([Richter](#Richter)).

=--

This implies that generalized [[Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectra]] on [[differential graded algebra|differential graded commutative algebras]] are [[E-k operad|E-infinity monoids]] in the category of $H \mathbb{Z}$-[[module]] [[spectrum|spectra]].


The article ([Richter](#Richter)) shows that the inverse $\Xi$ from chain complexes to simplicial abelian groups sends algebras over arbitrary differential graded [[E-k operad|E-infinity-operad]] to [[E-k-operad|E-infinity-algebra]] in simplicial modules, and is part of a [[Quillen adjunction]] for these.


### Quillen equivalences

We discuss [[Quillen equivalence]]s revolving around the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence. More details on their construction is below.

Write

$$
  (\Gamma \dashv N) / (N \dashv \Gamma) : Ch_\bullet^+ \stackrel{\overset{N}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
  s Ab
$$

for the ordinary [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]. $Ch_\bullet^+$ denotes the [[connective chain complex|connective]] chain complexes: non-negatively graded. 

Since $N$ and $\Gamma$ are strictly inverse to each other, this may be regarded as a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s in two ways. Moreover, with respect to the standard [[model category]] structures (the projective [[model structure on chain complexes]] (fibrations the degreewise surjections in positive degree) and the projective [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras|model structure on simplicial abelian groups]] (fibrations the underlying [[Kan fibration]])s ) both adjunctions are [[Quillen equivalence]]s.

Let 

* $(Ch_\bullet^+, \otimes)$ be the standard [[monoidal category]] structure on the [[category of chain complexes]];

*  And let $(sAb, \otimes)$ be the monoidal category structure that is degreewise that of [[Ab]].

For $(C, \otimes)$ a monoidal category, write $Mon(C)$ for its category of [[monoid]]s. Notice that

* $Mon(Ch_\bullet^+)$ is the category of connective differential graded rings.

* $Mon(sAb)$ is the category of [[simplicial ring]]s.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

The DK correspondence exhibits connective dg-rings as a full [[subcategory]] of simplicial rings 

$$
  \Gamma
   :
   Mon(Ch_\bullet^+) 
    \hookrightarrow
   Mon(sAb)
  \,.
$$

The composite functor

$$
  N \Gamma
  :
   Mon(Ch_\bullet^+) 
    \hookrightarrow
   Mon(Ch_\bullet^+)
$$

is equivalent to the identity.

#### Simplicial $k$-algebras and connective dg-algebras {#QuillenEquSimpkAlgs}

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $k$ a commutative ring, there is a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  (\Gamma^{mon} \dashv N) : dgAlg_k \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma^{mon}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}  Alg_k^{\Delta^{op}}
$$

between 

* the [[model structure on dg-algebras]] for connective [[dg-algebra]]s over $k$: weak equivalences are the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s, fibrations the degreewise surjections in positive degree

* and the [[model structure on simplicial algebras]] over $k$: weak equivalences and fibrations are those of the underlying simplicial sets in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

=--

This appears in section 4.2 of ([SchwedeShipley](#SchwedeShipley)).

Below in [Simplicial algebras and dg-Algebras](#AlgebrasOverdgAlgebra) a generalization of this statement is discussed. But it is worthwhile to spell out the proof just of this special case here. 


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Regard the ordinary [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

$$
  (\Gamma \dashv N) 
  : 
  Mod_k^{\Delta^{op}}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}
  Ch_\bullet(k)^+
$$

as a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras|model structure on simplicial k-modules]] and the projective [[model structure on chain complexes]] (fibrations the degreewise surjections in positive degree) with $N$ regarded as the _[[right adjoint]]_ . Notice that both $N$ and $\Gamma$ preserve _all_ weak equivalences and that the unit and counit of the adjunction are [[isomorphism]]s.

Both model categories involved are [[monoidal model categories]]. We claim that the above Quillen adjunction is a [[monoidal Quillen adjunction]] with respect to this structure.

First of all $N$ is a [[lax monoidal functor]] with the [[lax monoidal transformation]] $\nabla_{A,B} : N(A) \otimes N(B) \to N(A \otimes B)$ given by the [[Eilenberg-Zilber map]]. As described at [[oplax monoidal functor]] this induces an oplax monoidal structure on $\Gamma$ given by the composite

$$
  \Delta_{X,Y}
  :
  \Gamma(X \otimes Y) \stackrel{\Gamma(i_X \otimes i_Y)}{\to}
  \Gamma(N \Gamma X \otimes N \Gamma Y)
  \stackrel{\Gamma(\nabla_{\Gamma X, \Gamma Y})}{\to}
  \Gamma N(\Gamma X \otimes \Gamma Y)
  \stackrel{\epsilon_{\Gamma X \otimes \Gamma Y}}{\to}
  \Gamma X \otimes \Gamma Y
  \,.
$$
 
Now the [[Eilenberg-Zilber map]] $\nabla$ is (as discussed there) a chain [[homotopy equivalence]] and $i_\cdot$ and $\epsilon_\cdot$ are even isomorphisms. Since $\Gamma$ preserves all weak equivalences, it follows that $\Delta_{X,Y}$ is a weak equivalence.

This shows that $(\Gamma \dashv N)$ is a [[monoidal Quillen equivalence]]. Moreover, by standard facts the [[transferred model structure]]s on $Mon(Ch_\bullet(g)^+) = dgAlg_k^+$ and $Mon(Mod_k^{\Delta^{op}}) Alg_k^{\Delta^{op}}$ exist as indicated.

Therefore with the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+Quillen+adjunction#LiftToMonoids">theorem on lifts to monoids</a> described at [[monoidal Quillen adjunction]] the claim follows.

=--

But not only is $(\Gamma \dashv N)$ but also $(N \dashv \Gamma)$. This yields:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $k$ a commutative ring, there is a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  (N^{mon} \dashv \Gamma) : 
    Alg_k^{\Delta^{op}}
 \stackrel{\overset{N^{mon}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}  dgAlg_k  
$$

for the above model structures.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We check that 

$$
  (N \dashv \Gamma) : 
    Mod_k^{\Delta^{op}}
 \stackrel{\overset{N}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} Ch_\bullet^+(k)  
$$

is a [[monoidal Quillen adjunction]]: the oplax monoidal structure on the left adjoint $N$ is given by the [[Alexander-Whitney map]], which is a weak equivalence, as discussed there.

Therefore with the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+Quillen+adjunction#LiftToMonoids">theorem on lifts to monoids</a> described at [[monoidal Quillen adjunction]] the claim follows.


=--

#### Simplicial $A_\bullet$-algebras and connective dg-algebras {#AlgebrasOverdgAlgebra}

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

For $A$ a commutative [[simplicial ring]] there is a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  (Q \dashv N) : Alg_A \stackrel{\overset{Q}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} Alg_{N(A)}
$$

between simplicial $A$-algebras and connective differential $N(A)$-algebras, where the right adjoint in the normalization functor, but the left adjoint is not $\Gamma$.

=--

This is the main theorem in ([SchwedeShipley](#SchwedeShipley)).

#### Commutative and $E_\infty$-algebras

Notice that the above statement  is _not_ formulated for commutative monoids. But

###### Theorem

For $k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0 there is a Quillen equivalence

$$
  (Q \dashv N) : dgAlg^C_k \stackrel{\overset{Q}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}  sAlg^C_k
$$

between connected commutative connective [[dg-algebra]]s over $k$ and connected commutative [[simplicial algebra]]s over $k$

Here connected means: trivial in degree $k \leq 0$ (= "reduced").

=--

This is due to the remark on p. 223 of ([Quillen](#Quillen)).


In arbitrary characteristic we have instead

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

For $k$ a commutative ring, there is a Quillen equivalence

$$
  dgAlg^{E_\infty}_k \stackrel{\overset{}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{}{\to}}  sAlg^{E_\infty}_k
$$

between connective dg-[[E-∞ algebra]] over $k$ and simplicial $E_\infty$-algebras over $k$.

=--

This is in ([Mandell](#Mandell)).


Here the model category structures are analogous to those before: for simplicial $E_\infty$-algebras the weak equivalences and fibrations  are those of the underlying simplicial sets, and for connective dg-$E_\infty$-algebras they are the underlying quasi-isomorphisms and the underlying positive degreewise surjections.




## Cosimplicial algebras and cochain dg-algebras {#cosimplicial}

The monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence relating cosimplicial algebras to cochain dg-algebras is considered less prominently explicitly in the literature, but does appear implicitly in much classical work. For instance the classical statement that the [[cochains on simplicial sets]] form a [[dg-algebra]] that is commutative up to coherent higher homotopy, i.e. that is an [[E-k-operad|E-infinity algebra]], is really the statement that the Moore cochain complex functor on cosimplicial algebras of functions on [[simplicial set]]s is an $\infty$-monoidal functor in a suitable sense.

One article that does make a cosimplicial/cochain monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence explicit is ([CastiglioniCortinas](#CastiglioniCortinas))

This establishes not quite a [[Quillen equivalence]], but shows that the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] induces an [[equivalence]] of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] for the [[model structure on cosimplicial rings]] and the [[model structure on dg-algebras|model structure on dg-rings]].

However, this article explicitly constructs the (derived) [[adjoint functor]] to the Moore cochain complex functor. 

Explicit discussion of the Moore co-chain complex functor as inducing an $\infty$-monoidal functor seems not to be in the literature explicitly at time of this writing (?), even though various of its aspects are implicit, partly classical, statements. The following tries to make some aspects explicit.

### Lax and oplax monoidalness of conormalized cochains

#### Alexander--Whitney and shuffle morphisms {#AlexWhitneyShuffle}

A central ingredient in the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence are the Alexander--Whitney and the shuffle morphisms.

See chapter VI, paragraph 12 of

* A. Dold, _Lectures on algebraic topology_, Grundlehren Math. Wiss. vol 200, Springer-Verlag, New-York-Berlin, 1972

or chapter VIII, paragraph 8 of

* [[Saunders MacLane]], _Homology_ , Grundlehren Math. Wiss. vol 114, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-G&ouml;ttingen-Heidelberg, 1963 .

For $A, B$ cosimplicial abelian groups, $C A$ and $C B$ their [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex]]es, 

the **Alexander--Whitney morphism** is the morphism

$$  
  N A \otimes N B \to N(A \otimes B)
$$

that is given on homogeneous elements $x, y$ of degree $p,q$, respectively, by

$$
  x \otimes y \mapsto  
  \delta^n \circ \cdots \circ \delta^{p+1}(x)
  \;\;\otimes
  \;\;
  \delta^0 \circ \cdots \circ \delta^0
  (y)
  \,.
$$

Notice that for $A = B$ a cosimplicial algebra, further composing this with the product yields the [[cup product]] induced on dg-algebras of cosimplicial algebras. This is spelled out in detail below.

The **shuffle morphism** goes the other way

$$
  C(A \otimes B) \to C A \otimes C B
$$

and is given on homogeneous elements as above by

$$
  x  \otimes y 
  \mapsto
  \sum_{(\mu,\nu)}  
  \epsilon(\mu,\nu)
  \sigma^{\nu_1 - 1}
  \circ \cdots
  \circ
  \sigma^{\nu_q - 1}
  (x)
  \;\; \otimes
  \;\;
  \sigma^{\mu_1 - 1} \circ \cdots \circ
  \sigma^{\mu_p - 1}(y)
$$

where the sum is over all $(p,q)$ [[shuffle]]s $(\mu,\nu)$ and $\epsilon(\mu,\nu)$ is the sign of the shuffle.

Both the Alexander--Whitney morphism as well as the shuffle morphism respect the passage to the normalized [[Moore complex]] $N A$ of $C A$ and hence induce also morphisms

$$
  AW : N A \otimes N B \to N(A \otimes B)
$$

and 

$$
  S : N(A \otimes B) \to N A \otimes N B
  \,.
$$


In this form they satisfy

$$
  S \circ AW  = Id
  \,.
$$ 

See for instance theorem 2.1.a in ([EilenbergMacLane](#EilenbergMacLane)).


A quick summary of all this is in section 7 of

* Jos&eacute; Burgos Gil, _The regulators of Beilinson and Borel_ ([pdf](http://atlas.mat.ub.es/personals/burgos/files/brbr.pdf))



#### Lax monoidalness of the Moore co-chain complex functor 



+-- {: .standout}

[[Urs Schreiber]]:

We claim to show that the [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex functor]]

$$
  C : CoS(Ab) \to Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)
$$

from cosimplicial abelian groups to cochain complexes is a  [[lax monoidal functor]] with respect to the standard monoidal structures on $CoS(Ab)$ and $Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)$.

This should be old and standard, but somehow explicit statements in the literature to this extent are hard to find.(?) Some central aspects are recalled in [section 7](http://atlas.mat.ub.es/personals/burgos/files/brbr.pdf#page=63) of

* Jos&eacute; Burgos Gil, _The regulators of Beilinson and Borel_ ([pdf](http://atlas.mat.ub.es/personals/burgos/files/brbr.pdf))



=--


Every [[monoid]] $K$ in $CoS(An)$ -- a  cosimplicial ring --  the Moore cochain complex $C(K)$ is naturally equipped with the structure of a [[monoid]] in $Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)$ -- a [[differential graded algebra]] -- by letting the product $\smile : C(K)\otimes C(K) \to C(K)$ be given by the composite

$$
  \smile : C(K)\otimes C(K) \stackrel{\mu_{K,K}}{\to} C(K \otimes K) \stackrel{C(-\cdot -)}{\to} C(K)
$$

where 

* $\mu_{K,K}$ is the component of the [[lax monoidal transformation]] that exhibits the lax monoidal structure (the "compositor"); 

* The operation $-\cdot - : K \otimes K \to K$ is the product on $K$.

+-- {: .standout}


This monoidal structure induced from a cosimplicial ring $K$ on its Moore cochain complex on $C(K)$ is the [[cup product]]. 

=--


More precisely, for $X$ a [[topological space]] and $X^{\Delta^n_{Top}}$ the set of $n$-[[simplex|simplices]] in $X$, arranging themselves into the [[simplicial set]] $\Pi(X) = X^{\Delta^\bullet_{Top}}$ -- the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$ -- and for $R$ some [[ring]] let $Maps(\Pi(X),R)$ be the cosimplicial ring of maps $X^{\Delta^n_{Top}} \to R$. 

Then 

* the Moore cochain complex $C(Maps(\Pi(X),R))$ is the cochain complex that computes the [[singular cohomology]] of $X$;

* the monoid structure induced on $C(Maps(\Pi(X),R))$ by the lax monoidalness of the Moore cochain complex functor is the familiar [[cup product]] on [[singular cohomology]].

We now derive this in detail.

  C : CoS(A) \to Ch_+^\bullet(A)
$$

is an [[equivalence of categories]]. This is the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].

For $A = $ [[Ab]] with its standard [[monoidal category]] structure $(A,\otimes)$,
there are standard [[monoidal category]]
structures $(CoS(A), \otimes)$ and $(Ch_+^\bullet(X), \otimes)$:

* for $K,L \in CoS(A)$ their [[tensor product]] $K \otimes L$ is the
_degreewise tensor product_, i.e. the cosimplicial object with 
$(K \otimes L)^n = K^n \otimes L^n$ and with cosimplicial maps the
tensor product of the cosimplicial maps in $K$ and $L$.

* for $V,W \in Ch_+^\bullet(A)$ their [[tensor product]] $V \otimes W$
the _graded tensor product_, i.e. the cochain complex with
$(V \otimes W)^n = \oplus_{p+q = n} V^p \otimes W^q$ whose
coboundary map is given on homogeneous elements 
$\nu \otimes \omega\in V^p \otimes W^q$ by
  $$
    d (\nu \otimes \omega) = (d_V \nu) \otimes \omega + (-)^{p} \nu \otimes d_W \omega
    \,.
  $$

With respect to these standard monoidal  structures
the [[Moore complex|Moore cochain complex]] functor $C : CoS(A) \to Ch_+^\bullet(A)$
becomes a [[lax monoidal functor]] with the following lax monoidal 
[[natural transformation]] map 
$\mu : C(-) \otimes C(-) \to C(-\otimes -) : CoS(A) \times CoS(A) \to Ch_+^\bullet(A)$ .

###### Definition (lax monoidal structure on Moore cochain complex functor)

For $K,L \in CoS(A)$ define the component map

$$
  \mu_{K,L} : C(K)\otimes C(L) \to C(K \otimes L)
$$
 
by defining it on homogeneous elements 

$a\otimes b \in C^p(K)\otimes C^q(L) \subset (C(K)\otimes C(L))^{p+k}$ by

$$
  \mu_{K,L} : a\otimes b \mapsto (d_{p+1})^p a) \otimes 
   ((d_0)^q b) =: a \smile b
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

The iterated application of cosimplicial face maps on the right is to be thought of as producing a $(p+q)$-cosimplex in  $C(K \otimes L)^{p+q} = K^{p+q}\otimes L^{p+q}$ by 
evaluating the $p$-cosimplex $a$ on "leftmost" simplicial $p$-faces 
and the $q$-simplex $b$ on "rightmost" simplicial $q$-faces and then 
tensoring the resulting group elements.

=--


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

The $\mu_{K,L}$ defined this is indeed a cochain map.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have to check that $\mu$ respect the coboundary maps in that for all $a,b$ as above we have

$$
  d \circ \mu (a \otimes b) = \mu \circ d (a \otimes b)
  \,.
$$

By definition of the cup product and the differential on the 
Moore cochain complex we have
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d \circ \mu (a \otimes b)
    &=
    d (a \smile b) 
    \\
    &= d ( ((d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes ((d_0)^p b) )
    \\
    &=
    \sum_{i=0}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  d_i((d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes ((d_0)^p b)     
  \end{aligned}
$$

By definition the face maps on the tensor product $K \otimes L$
are just the tensor products of the face maps of $K$ and $L$, so that this is

$$  
    \cdots
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  (d_i (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_i (d_0)^p b) 
    \,.
$$

Break up this sum in three parts

$$
    \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  (d_i (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_i (d_0)^p b)     
    +
    (-1)^{p+1}  (d_{p+1} (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_{p+1} (d_0)^p b)     
    +
    \sum_{i=p+2}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  (d_i (d_{p+1})^q a) \otimes (d_i (d_0)^p b)     
$$

Now repeatedly use the [[simplicial identities]] for face maps

$$
   (i \lt j) \;\;\Rightarrow \;\; d_i \circ d_j = d_j \circ d_{i-1}
$$

to pass face maps from the left to the right. This yields

$$
    \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^{p+1}  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_1 b)     
    +
    \sum_{i=p+2}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i-p}b)         
    \,.
$$
Observe that the second term may now be naturally included in the
sum in the third term, leaving two sums

$$
  \cdots =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    \sum_{i=p+1}^{p+q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i-p}b)             
    \,.
$$

Reduce the summation index on the second sum by $p$ to obtain

$$
  \cdots =
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^p
    \sum_{i=1}^{q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i}b)             
    \,.
$$

Each sum seperately is now almost the alternating sum expression of an application
of the Moore complex coboundary map, except for one missing term in each sum.
But the two missing terms are equal and of opposite sign, so we can add them in

$$
 \begin{aligned}
  \cdots 
  =&
    \sum_{i=0}^{p}
    (-1)^i  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_i a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^{p+1}  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_{p+1} a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    \\
    &
    +
    (-1)^{p}  ( (d_{p+2})^q d_{p+1} a) \otimes ( (d_0)^{p+1} b)     
    +
    (-1)^p
    \sum_{i=1}^{q+1}
    (-1)^i  ((d_{p+1})^{q+1} a) \otimes ((d_0)^p d_{i}b)             
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

One last application of the simplicial identities in the third tirm shows that
indeed this is the missing term in the sum in the fourth term. 
Comparing the result with the definition of coboundary map and cup product
we find finally

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \cdots &= (d a) \smile b + (-1)^p a \smile (d b) 
    \\
    &=
    \mu \circ d (a \otimes b)
   \end{aligned}
    \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

This $\mu$ is indeed natural in $K,L$. For every $f : K \to K'$ and $g : L\to L'$ we have

$$
  \array{
    C(K) \otimes C(L) &\stackrel{\mu_{K,L}}{\to}& C(K \otimes L)
    \\
    \;\;\;\downarrow^{C(f)\otimes C(g)} && \;\;\;\downarrow^{C(f \otimes g)}
    \\
    C(K') \otimes C(L') &\stackrel{\mu_{K',L'}}{\to}& C(K' \otimes L')    
  }
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


This is immediate from the fact that the morphisms $f, g$ of cosimplicial objects respect the face maps.

=--


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The natural transformation $\mu$ is indeed a lax monoidal transformation
in that it is associative and unital in the required sense.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that for all $J,K,L \in CoS(A)$ we have

$$
 \array{
  C(J) \otimes C(K) \otimes C(L) &\stackrel{Id_{C(J)} \otimes \mu_{K,L}}{\to}&
  C(J)\otimes C(K \otimes L)
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  C(J \otimes K) \otimes C(L)
  &\stackrel{\mu_{J,K} \otimes Id_{C(L)}}{\to}&
  C(J\otimes K \otimes L)
 }
  \,.
$$

it is sufficient to check this on all homogeneous elements
$a \otimes b \otimes c \in C^o(J)\otimes C^p(K) \otimes C^q(L)$.
There it is straightforward to check by using simplicial identities.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark


The above statement is obvious when one observes the geometric  interpretation of the above remark: the image of $a \otimes b \otimes c$
along both ways around the above square is the $o+p+q$-dimensional
cosimplex that is obtained by evaluating $a$ on the leftmost $o$-face,
$p$ on the middle $p$-face and $q$ on the rightmost $q$-face and then
tensoring the resulting group elements.

###### Corollary

The Moore cochain complex functor 

$$
  C : CoS(Ab) \to Ch_+^\bullet(Ab)
$$

can be equipped with a lax monoidal 
structure with respect to the standard monoidal structure on cosimplicial abelian groups and on connective cochain complexes of abelian groups.

#### $E_\infty$-cup product on cochains on simplicial sets {#EooCup}

At least for those [[cosimplicial algebra]]s $A$ that are algebras of [[cochains on simplicial sets]] $S^\bullet \in SSet$, i.e. $A = C(S^\bullet, R)$ it is known that the Moore complex [[dg-algebra]] $N^\bullet(A)$ equipped with the [[cup product]] is an [[E-k-operad|E-∞]]-[[algebra over an operad|algebra]]. See [[cochains on simplicial sets]] for details on this.
