## Idea

The _cosmic consorship hypothesis_ is a hypothesis in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) saying that under physically reasonable conditions all [[singularities]] in [[spacetime]] have to be behind an [[event horizon]].

## References

A formalization and proof of one version of the hypothesis, and discussion of relation to [[computability in physics]] and [[Malamentâ€“Hogarth spacetimes]] is in
