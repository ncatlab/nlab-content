## Idea

The (weak or strong) _cosmic censorship hypothesis_ is a [[conjecture]] due [[Roger Penrose]] in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) saying that under physically reasonable conditions all [[singularities]] in [[spacetime]] have to be behind an [[event horizon]].

The weak cosmic censorship conjecture has many counterexamples in [[dimension]] $d \geq 5$. In ([Crisford-Santos 17](#CrisfordSantos17)) finally a counterexample in $d = 4$ was found. The counterexample involves large [[electromagnetic field]] contributions in [[Einstein-Maxwell theory]].

Hence if the cosmic censorship hypothesis is to become true, it needs to add some assumption on the nature of the extra [[force]] fields besides [[gravity]].

[[Cumrun Vafa]] has argued that the _[[weak gravity conjecture]]_ will save the cosmic censorship conjecture. The weak gravity conjecture says that in consistent theories of [[quantum gravity]] the gravitational force exerted by any object (e.g. a [[black hole]]) has to be weaker, in suitable units, than any other force. As discussed in ([Crisford-Santos 17](#CrisfordSantos17)) it seems plausible that this constraint would indeed rule out the counterexample constructed there:

> Subsequent calculations by Santos and Crisford supported Vafa's hunch; the simulations they're running now could verify that naked singularities become cloaked in black holes right at the point where gravity becomes the weakest force. ([Wolchover, June 20 2017](https://www.quantamagazine.org/where-gravity-is-weak-and-naked-singularities-are-verboten-20170620/))


The [[weak gravity conjecture]] was motivated from [[string theory]], where there are various plausibility arguments that it holds.
