## Definition 

An [[ordered field]] $F$ is **real closed** if it satisfied the following two properties: 

* Any positive element $x \geq 0$ in $F$ has a [[square root]] in $F$; 

* Any odd-degree [[polynomial]] with coefficients in $F$ has a root in $F$. 

Notice that the order on a real closed field is definable from the algebraic structure: $x \leq y$ if and only if $\exists_z x + z^2 = y$. (In particular, there is a _unique_ ordering on a real closed field, defined by taking the positive elements to be precisely the nonzero squares.) Thus the category of real closed fields and order-preserving field homomorphisms is a full subcategory of the category of [[field|fields]] and field homomorphisms. 

## Properties 

Real closed fields can be equivalently characterized by any of the following properties: 

1. $F$ is not [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], but some finite [[field extension|extension]] is. This extension is necessarily $F[\sqrt{-1}]$. See also [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. 

1. As a field, $F$ is [[elementary equivalence|elementarily equivalent]] to the field of real numbers. 

1. The [[intermediate value theorem]] holds for all polynomials with coefficients in $F$. 

1. $F$ is an ordered field that has no ordered algebraic extension. 

In fact, there is a [[completion]] of any [[ordered field]] to a real closed field, in the following sense:

######Proof 
We sketch the main ingredients of the proof, and refer to Lang's _Algebra_ ($3^{rd}$ edition), 454-455, for the full details. 

By a Zorn's lemma argument, every ordered field $F$ (which a fortiori is a real field) may be embedded in a real closed field which is algebraic over $F$. Let $\widebar{F}$ be such an extension. It suffices to prove that every field embedding $F \to R$ into a real closed field uniquely extends to a field embedding $i: \widebar{F} \to R$. Let $\alpha \in \widebar{F}$; then $\alpha$ and all of its conjugates in $\widebar{F}$ form the roots of a degree $n$ polynomial $f(x)$ with coefficients in $F$. This $f(x)$ has $n$ roots in $R$ because $R$, being real closed, has no nontrivial real algebraic extensions. We may linearly order the conjugates in $\widebar{F}$ as $\alpha_1 \lt \ldots \lt \alpha_n$ according to the unique ordering on $F$ (the roots are distinct since we are working in a characteristic zero field and such fields are perfect), and similarly we may order the roots in $R$ as $\beta_1 \lt \ldots \lt \beta_n$. The extension $i$ between real closed fields must preserve order, and so if $\alpha = \alpha_k$, then $i(\alpha_k)$ can only be $\beta_k$, and the mapping $\alpha_k \mapsto \beta_k$ then defines a unique order-preserving field embedding $F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \to R$ over $F$. Since any algebraic extension of $F$ is the filtered colimit of finite extensions of $F$, we obtain a unique extension $i: \widebar{F} \to R$, as desired.

## Examples 

1. The [[real number]]s form a real closed field. 

1. Real [[algebraic number]]s form a real closed field. 

1. A field of nonstandard real numbers (as in Robinson [[nonstandard analysis]]) is real closed. 

1. [[surreal number|Surreal numbers]] form a (large) real closed field. 

1. If $F$ is real closed, then the field of [[Puiseux series]] over $F$ is also real closed. 

1. More generally, given a real closed field $F$, the field of [[Hahn series]] over $F$ with [[valuation ring|value group]] $G$ (an ordered group) is real closed provided that $G$ is divisible. 

1. Any [[o-minimal structure|o-minimal]] ordered ring structure $R$ is a real closed field. 

1. Given an o-minimal ordered ring $R$, the field of [[germ]]s at infinity of definable functions $R \to R$ in any o-minimal expansion of $(R, 0, 1, +, -, \cdot, \lt)$ is real closed. (By "germ at infinity", we mean an equivalence class of functions for which $f \equiv g$ if and only if $f(x) = g(x)$ for all sufficiently large $x$.)
