## Definition 

An [[ordered field]] $F$ is **real closed** if it satisfied the following two properties: 

* Any positive element $x \gt 0$ in $F$ is a square of an element in $F$; 

* Any odd degree polynomial with coefficients in $F$ has a root in $F$. 

## Properties 

Real closed fields can be equivalently characterized by any of the following properties: 

1. $F$ is not algebraically closed, but $F[\sqrt{-1}]$ is. See also [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. 

1. As an ordered field, $F$ is elementarily equivalent to the field of real numbers. 

1. The intermediate value theorem holds for all polynomials with coefficients in $F$. 

(More to be added.) 

## Examples 

1. The real numbers form a real closed field. 

1. Real [[algebraic number]]s form a real closed field. 

1. [[surreal number|Surreal numbers]] form a (large) real closed field. 

1. Any [[o-minimal structure|o-minimal]] ordered ring structure $R$ is real closed. 

1. Given an o-minimal ordered ring $R$, the ring of germs at infinity of definable functions $R \to R$ in any o-minimal expansion of $(R, 0, 1, +, -, \cdot, \lt)$ form a real closed field.
