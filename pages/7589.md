
Bill Thurston was an American mathematician who made important contributions to the theory of [[orbifold]]s and to [[geometric group theory]].  He is best known for his [[geometrization conjecture]] (which was proved by [[Grigori Perelman]] and which in turn implies the [[Poincar√© conjecture]]).
