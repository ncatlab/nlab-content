
Various concepts go by the name _monad_ but are otherwise unrelated:

In [[category theory]] and [[computer science]] a _monad_ is a [[monoid]] [[action|acting]] on a [[category]]/[[type|type system]], see at

* [[monad]] (in [[category theory]]) and [[monad (in computer science)]]

This is a wide-spread use of the term _monad_ in mathematics. But historically older, going back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], is the use of "monad" for referring to a kind of "[[atom]] of [[space]]" (see also in [[Science of Logic]] the section _[The Monad of Leibniz](Science%20of%20Logic#TheMonadOfLeibniz)_). In roughly this sense the term is used in 

* [[monad in nonstandard analysis]]

* [[Beilinson monad]]
