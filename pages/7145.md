
Various concepts go by the name _monad_.


Historically, going back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], "monad" is used to refer to a kind of "[[atom]] of [[space]]" (see also in [[Science of Logic]] the section _[The Monad of Leibniz](Science%20of%20Logic#TheMonadOfLeibniz)_). In roughly this sense the term is used in 

* [[monad in nonstandard analysis]]

* [[Beilinson monad]]


In [[category theory]] and [[computer science]] a _monad_ is a [[monoid]] [[action|acting]] on a [[category]]/[[type|type system]], see at

* [[monad]] (in [[category theory]]) and [[monad (in computer science)]]

To see this as an "atom" one observes that this is equivalently a [[lax 2-functor]] $\ast \longrightarrow Cat$ from the [[terminal category]] to the [[Cat|2-category of categories]] and hence a "point" in the canonical [[2-topos]].
