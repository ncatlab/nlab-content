## Idea

The cone type is an axiomatization of the [[cone]] in the context of homotopy type theory.

## Definition

A cone type on a type $A$ is a [[higher inductive type]] $Cone(A)$ inductively generated by 

* A term $e:Cone(A)$

* A function $i: A \to Cone(A)$

* A term 

$$p: \prod_{a:A} e = i(a)$$

In [[Coq]] pseudocode, the cone is given by

    Inductive Cone (A : Type) : Type
      | vertex : Cone A
      | base :  A -> Cone A
      | edge : A -> Id Cone A vertex base(a)

It can equivalently be defined as the (homotopy) [[pushout]] of $A$ and the unit type $1$ under $A$.  This definition makes it clear that the cone type is always a [[contractible type]]. As a result, cone types could be though of as a way of constructing free contractible types for any type $A$. 

## Examples

* The [[unit type]] $1$ is the cone type of an empty type $0$. 

* The [[interval type]] $I$ is the cone type of the unit type $1$

* A [[simplex type]] $\Delta_n$ is the cone type of the simplex type $\Delta_{n-1}$. $\Delta_1 = I$ and $\Delta_0 = 1$.
