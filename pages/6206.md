## Idea

A _Wasserstein metric_ is a certain [[Riemannian metric]] over a space of [[probability measure]]s on a [[measurable space]] $X$.

By ([JKO](#JKO)) we have that the  [[heat flow]] on $X$ is the [[gradient flow]] of the [[entropy|Boltzman-Shannon entropy]] functional with respect to the Wasserstein metric.
