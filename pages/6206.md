## Idea

A _Wasserstein metric_ is a certain [[metric]] over a space of [[probability measure]]s on a [[measurable space]] $X$.

By ([JKO](#JKO)) the  [[heat flow]]/[[diffusion equation]] on $X$ is the [[gradient flow]] of the [[entropy|Boltzman-Shannon entropy]] functional with respect to the Wasserstein metric.

The Wasserstein metric does not seem to arise from a [[Riemannian metric|Riemann metric tensor]]. A detailed discussion of the relevant gradient flows in non-smooth [[metric space]]s is in ([AGS](#AGS)).
