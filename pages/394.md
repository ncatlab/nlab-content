## Idea

A [[functor]] $F\colon C \to D$ is **essentially surjective**, or **essentially surjective on objects** (sometimes abbreviated to **eso**), if it is surjective on objects "up to isomorphism".


## Definition

$F\colon C \to D$ is **essentially surjective** if for every [[object]] $y$ of $D$, there exists an object $x$ of $C$ and an [[isomorphism]] $F(x) \cong y$ in $D$.


## Examples

* A functor between [[discrete categories]] (or, more generally, [[skeletal categories]]) is essentially surjective iff it is a [[surjective function]] between the classes of objects.

* Any [[bijective-on-objects functor]] is essentially surjective.

* A [[composition]] of any two essentially surjective functors is essentially surjective.

* If $g f$ is essentially surjective, then $g$ is essentially surjective.

* An essentially surjective functor is additionally [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] precisely when it is an [[equivalence of categories]].


## Properties

* Strengthening the last example, there is an [[factorization system in a 2-category|orthogonal factorization system]] (in the up-to-isomorphism [[strict 2-category|strict]] sense) on $Cat$, in which eso functors are the left class and fully faithful functors are the right class.

  This is an "up-to-isomorphism" version of the [[bo-ff factorization system]], which is a 1-categorical orthogonal factorization system on $Cat$ in which the left class consists of [[bijective-on-objects functors]].  Thus essentially surjective is a non-[[evil]] version of "bijective on objects", i.e. the version which views $Cat$ as a bicategory.

* In any 2-category there is a notion of [[eso morphism]] which generalizes the essentially surjective functors in [[Cat]].  In a [[regular 2-category]], these form a [[factorization system in a 2-category]] together with the [[ff morphisms]].
