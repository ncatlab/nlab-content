**Formal groups and elliptic cohomology.**

In all of the following, all [[cohomology theory|cohomology theories]] are [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] and all [[formal group law]]s are one-dimensional (and commutative).

**[[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology - cohomology theories|Last time]].**  Orienting a [[periodic cohomology theory|periodic]] [[even cohomology theory]] gives a [[formal group law]]
over the [[cohomology ring]] $A^0(\bullet)$.  (Note: $A^0$ and not $A^*$ because of the periodicity property.)

**Today.**  A generalization of the above statement.
Orienting a [[weakly periodic cohomology theory|weakly periodic]] even cohomology theory gives a formal group over $A^0(\bullet)$.
In particular, [elliptic cohomology]] theories give [[elliptic curve]]s over $A^0(\bullet)$.

**Formal group laws and Landweber's criterion.**

[[formal group law|Formal group law]]s over $R$ are classified by [[morphism]]s from the [[Lazard ring]] to $R$.
We can define $A_f^n(X)=MP^n(X)\otimes_{MP(\bullet)}R$.
Here $MP$ denotes [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|complex cobordism]], in particular $MP(\bullet)$ is isomorphic to [[Lazard ring|Lazard's ring]].

**Definition.**  A sequence $v_0,\ldots,v_n$ of elements of $R$ is regular
if [[endomorphism]]s of $R/(v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1})$ given by multiplication by $v_k$
are injective for all $0\le k\le n$.

**Landweber's Criterion.**  Let $f(x,y)$ be a formal group law and $p$ a prime,
$v_i$ the coefficient of $x^{p^i}$ in $[p]_f(x)=x+_f\cdots+_fx$.
If $v_0,\ldots,v_i$ form a regular sequence for all $p$ and $i$ then $f(x,y)$ gives a 
[[cohomology theory]] via the formula with [[tensor product]] above.

**Example.**  $g_a(x,y)=x+y$, $[p]_a(x)=px$, $v_0=p$, $v_i=0$ for all $i\ge1$;
regularity condtions imply that
the zero map $R/(p)\to R/(p)$ must be injective.  The last statement implies that
$R$ contains the rational numbers as a subring.

Note that $HP^*(X,R)=\prod_k H^{n+2k}(X,R)$ is a [[cohomology theory]] over any [[ring]] $R$.

**Example.**  $g_m(x,y)=xy$, $[p]_m(x)=(x+1)^p-1$, $v_0=p$, $v_1=1$, $v_i=0$ for all $i \gt 1$.
The regularity conditions are trivial.
Hence we know that $K^*(X)=MP^*(X)\otimes_{MP(\bullet)} \mathbb{Z}$ is a cohomology theory.

**Groups from formal group laws.**  Given a commutative topological
$R$-algebra $A$ and a formal group law$f(x,y)$ if $f(a,b)$ converges for all $a,b\in A$
we get an abelian group $(A,+_f)$, where $a+_f b=f(a,b)$.

**Example.**  For any $A$ the pair $(N(A),+_f)$ is an abelian group, where
$N(A)$ denotes the set of nilpotent elements of $A$.

**Example.**  Let $A$ be an complex oriented cohomology theory.
Then computing [[Chern class]]es of [[line bundle]]s is the same as evaluating the
formal group law of $A$ on some algebra.
Recall that [[line bundle]]s on $X$ are [[classifying space|classified]] by maps from $X$ to $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$,
pairs of line bundles are classified by maps to $\mathbb{C}P^\infty \times \mathbb{C}P^\infty$,
and tensor product of line bundles gives a map $\mathbb{C}P^\infty \times \mathbb{C}P^\infty \to \mathbb{C}P^\infty$.
Now apply cohomology functor to the sequence $X\to \mathbb{C}P^\infty \times \mathbb{C}P^\infty \to \mathbb{C}P^\infty$.
We have a degree 0 element $t$ in the cohomology of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$.
Its image in the cohomology of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty \times \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is a formal group law.
The image of this formal group law in the cohomology of $X$ makes sense
if $X$ is a finite cell complex so that $A^0(X)$ is a nilpotent algebra.

When do two formal group laws yield isomorphic groups?

**Definiton.**  A homomorphism of formal group laws $f$ and $g$ over $A$
is a formal power series $\phi\in A[x]$ such that $\phi(f(x,y))=g(\phi(x),\phi(y))$.
(The constant term of~$\phi$ is zero.)
Hence formal group laws form a category.

**Example.**  If $R$ contains rational numbers as a subring,
then we have two canonical homomorphisms.  The first one is $\exp\colon g_a\to g_m$, where
$\exp(x)=\sum_{k \gt 0}x^k/k!$.  Its inverse is $\log\colon g_m\to g_a$, where
$\log(x)=\sum_{k \gt 0}(-1)^{k+1}x^k/k$.
This shows up in cohomology as Chern character.
(Isomorphism from $K^n(X)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$ to $\prod_kH^{n+2k}(X,\mathbb{Q})$.

**Formal groups.**  A [[formal group]] is a group in the [[category]] of [[formal scheme]]s.

Intuitive explanation of the notion of [[formal scheme]]:
Informally, $\hat X$ is like the $\infty$-jet bundle of $Y$ inside of $X$.

**Definition.**  The locally [[ringed space]] $\hat X$ is defined as the [[topological space]] $Y$
with structure sheaf $\lim O_X/^n$, where $V(U)$ has underlying space $Y$.
(Where $Y$ is a closed subscheme of $X$.)

**Examples.**  $X=\hat X$ when $Y=X$.  $\mathrm{Spec} k[t]=X$, $Y=V(t)$, $\hat X=k[t,t^{-1}]$.

**Definition.** $\mathrm{Spf} R$ is the locally [[ringed space]] with the underlying [[topological space]]
$\mathrm{Spec} R/I$ and [[sheaf]] $O_{\mathrm{Spf} R}(\mathrm{Spf} R)=\lim R/I^n$.
