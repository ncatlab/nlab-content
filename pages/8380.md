## Idea

In [[computer science]] a _monad_ $T$ is an operation on the [[types]] that

1. sends each [[type]] $A$ to some new type $T(A)$;

1. provides a [[term]] of [[function type]] $return_A : A \to T(A)$;

1. provides a rule that creates from a [[term]] $t : T(A)$ and a function $f : A \to T(B)$ a term $bind_A : T(B)$

such that this satisfies the evident coherence axioms.

Under the identification of computer science with [[category theory]] (see _[[computational trinitarianism]]_) the [[universe]] of types of the programming language is a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and a monad as above is a [[strong monad|(strong)]] [[monad|monad in the sense of category theory]], hence a [[functor]] $T : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ equipped with the structure of a [[monoid]] in endomorphisms.

Monads provide one way to "embed [[imperative programming]] in 
[[functional programming]]", and are used that way notably in the 
[[programming language]] [[Haskell]]. But monads (as well as [[comonads]] and related structures) exist much more generally in programming languages. ([Harper](#Harper))


## Examples

* A number of monads are *definable* in terms of standard type-forming operations, such as the [[maybe monad]], the [[reader monad]], the [[writer monad]], and the [[state monad]].

* Other monads may be supplied "axiomatically" by the programming language, such as the [[IO monad]] in [[Haskell]].

* Equipping [[homotopy type theory]] (say implemented as a programming language concretely in [[Coq]] or [[Agda]]) with two axiomatic [[idempotent monads]], denoted $\sharp$ and $\Pi$, with some additional data and relations, turns it into _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_.

## References

The technical definition can be found in...

> ...where? There are many, many references of and expositions of monads in computer science. Somebody who knows a _good_ reference, please add it here. We may assume that the readers knows monads, and knows type systems. We need a reference that gives a crisp precise definition: "A monad in a typed functional programming language is ..."
