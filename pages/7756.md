## Idea

A __first-order theory__ is a [[theory]] which allows for [[quantification]] over [[variables]], but not over sets of variables. It is a theory (= language + [[axioms]]) in a language consisting of  the language of [[first-order logic]], plus additional relation, function and constant symbols.  

The characterization of [[models]] over first-order theories is the topic of traditional [[model theory]].

## Examples

Formulation of [[set theory]] is a first-order theory, such as

* [[material set theory]]: [[ZFC]]

* [[structural set theory]]: [[fully formal ETCS]]
