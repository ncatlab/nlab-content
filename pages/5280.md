## Statement

The Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem says that the order relation on cardinalities of [[set]]s is antisymmetric. In other words, define an order on sets by $X \leq Y$ if there exists a monomorphism $f: X \to Y$. Then, if both $X \leq Y$ and $Y \leq X$, there exists an [[isomorphism]] of sets $X \cong Y$. 

## Proof 

We prove that the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem holds in a [[Boolean topos]]. The theorem is not however intuitionistically valid, in that it fails in some [[topos]]es, such as the topos $Set^{\bullet \to \bullet}$. 

Throughout we use ordinary set-theoretic reasoning which can be translated into the formal theory of toposes. (This can be formalized via the Mitchell-Benabou language, for instance.)

###### Lemma (Knaster-Tarski fixed-point theorem) 
Let $f: P X \to P X$ be an order-preserving map. Then there exists $S$ in $P X$ for which $f(S) = S$.

###### Proof 
Let $S$ be the (internal) intersection of $U = \{T \in PX: f(T) \leq T\}$. 
Since $S \leq T$ for every $T$ in $U$, we have $f(S) \leq f(T) \leq T$ for every $T$ in $U$. Hence $f(S) \leq S$ by definition of $S$. Applying $f$ again, we get $f f(S) \leq f(S)$. Hence $f(S)$ belongs to $U$. But then $S \leq f(S)$ by definition of $S$.

**Remark:** The preceding proof _is_ intuitionistically valid. It can be seen as a special case of a result of Lambek on the initial [[algebra of an endofunctor]].

######Proof of Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein
Suppose given two monos $f: X \to Y$, $g: Y \to X$. Let $\exists_f: P X \to P Y$ denote existential quantification along $f$, and let $\neg_X: P X \to P X$ denote negation. Then the composite 

$$\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f: P X \to P X$$ 

is order-preserving, and so has a fixed point $S$ by the lemma. Now define 
$h: X \to Y$ by the rule 

$$\array{
h(x) & = & f(x) & if x \in S \\
h(x) & = & g^{-1}(x) & if x \notin S
}$$ 

(the multi-line definition is where we use the Boolean condition). The second line makes sense because $\neg S$ is in the image of $g$. The inverse of $h$ is 

$$\array{
j(y) & = & f^{-1}(y) & if y \in \exists_f(S) \\
j(y) & = & g(y) & if y \notin \exists_f(S)
}$$

That $j$ is inverse to h uses the fact that $\neg S = \exists_g \neg \exists_f(S)$. The rest is obvious.

This classic proof is substantially the proof given in Johnstone's [[Elephant]], D4.1.11. The Boolean condition is not strictly speaking necessary, i.e., the [[principle of excluded middle]] does not logically follow from the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein statement since, for example, the latter holds vacuously (every mono is an iso) in the non-Boolean topos 

$$FinSet^C$$ 

where $C$ is a finite category. But it is certainly the most natural supposition to make. 

## In other categories

The CSB property holds in many other categories of interest, for example [[vector space]]s and [[algebraically closed field]]s. The question of when the CSB property holds was partially addressed in this [MO post](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/1058/when-does-cantor-bernstein-hold), where model-theoretic criteria come into play, sometimes under strengthenings of the notion of monomorphism (e.g., [[elementary embedding]], [[split monomorphism]]). 

More examples and discussion can be found at this Secret Blogging Seminar [post](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/theme-and-variations-schroeder-bernstein/). 

In a celebrated work, Timothy Gowers gave a negative solution in the case of [[Banach space]]s.
