The Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem says that the order relation on cardinalities of [[set]]s is antisymmetric. In other words, define an order on sets by $X \leq Y$ if there exists a monomorphism $f: X \to Y$. Then, if both $X \leq Y$ and $Y \leq X$, there exists an [[isomorphism]] of sets $X \cong Y$. 

## Proof 

We prove that the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem holds in a [[Boolean topos]]. The theorem is not however intuitionistically valid. 

Throughout we use ordinary set-theoretic reasoning which can be translated into the formal theory of toposes.

###### Lemma (Tarski fixed-point theorem) 
Let $f: P X \to P X$ be an order-preserving map. Then there exists $S$ in $P X$ for which $f(S) = S$.

###### Proof 
Let $S$ be the (internal) intersection of $U = \{T \in PX: f(T) \leq T\}$. 
Since $S \leq T$ for every $T$ in $U$, we have $f(S) \leq f(T) \leq T$ for every $T$ in $U$. Thus $f(S) \leq S$ by definition of $S$. Applying $f$ again, we get $f f(S) \leq f(S)$. Hence $f(S)$ belongs to $U$. But then $S \leq f(S)$ by definition of $S$.

**Remark:** This proof _is_ intuitionistically valid. It can be seen as a special case of a result of Lambek on the initial [[algebra of an endofunctor]].

######Proof of Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein
Suppose given two monos $f: X \to Y$, $g: Y \to X$. Let $\exists_f: P X \to P Y$ denote existential quantification along $f$, and let $\neg_X: P X \to P X$ denote negation. Then the composite 

$$\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f: P X \to P X$$ 

is order-preserving, and so has a fixed point $S$ by the lemma. Now define 
$h: X \to Y$ by the rule 

$$h(x) = 
\left{ \array{
f(x) & if x \in S \\
g^{-1}(x) & if x \notin S
}$$ 

The second line makes sense because $\neg S$ is in the image of $g$. 
The inverse of $h$ is 

$$j(y) = 
\left{ \array{
f^{-1}(x) & if y \in \exists_f(S) \\
g(y) & if y \notin \exists_f(S)
}$$

That $j$ is inverse to h uses the fact that $\neg S = \exists_g \neg \exists_f(S)$. The rest is obvious.
