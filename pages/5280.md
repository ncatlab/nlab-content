## Statement

The _Cantor--Schroeder--Bernstein_ theorem says that the usual [[order relation]] on [[cardinalities]] of [[set]]s is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]]. In other words, define an order on sets by $X \leq Y$ if there exists a [[monomorphism]] $f\colon X \to Y$. Then, if both $X \leq Y$ and $Y \leq X$, there exists an [[isomorphism]] of sets $X \cong Y$.

The result is really only interesting in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]] ($AC$).  With $AC$, it is a trivial corollary of the [[well-ordering theorem]].  However, the theorem actually requires only [[excluded middle]], although it does not hold in [[constructive mathematics]].


## Proof 

We prove that the Cantor--Schroeder--Bernstein theorem holds in a [[Boolean topos]]. The theorem is not however [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistically]] valid, in that it fails in some [[topos]]es, such as the topos $Set^{\bullet \to \bullet}$ (the [[arrow category]] of $Set$); see Example \ref{counterexample} below. 

Throughout we use ordinary [[set theory|set-theoretic]] reasoning which can be translated into the formal theory of toposes. (This can be formalized via the [[Mitchellâ€“Benabou language]], for instance.) 

First, let's try a little pedagogy. Somehow functions $h: X \to Y, h^{-1}: Y \to X$ are to be cooked up from injections $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$, so we might guess $h$ is to be defined as $f$ at least part of the time, and $h^{-1}$ as $g$ another part of the time. An ideal situation would be to have a set-up 

$$f: A \stackrel{\sim}{\to} B$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$C \stackrel{\sim}{\longleftarrow} D: g$$ 

where $A, C$ are complementary subsets and $B, D$ are complementary subsets; then $h$ could be defined as $f$ on $A$ and as $g^{-1}$ on $C$, and everything works out fine. How can we achieve this? 

If we have this situation, then apparently $B = f(A)$ (the direct image of $A$, and $D = \neg B = \neg f(A)$ (the complement of $f(A)$), and then $C = g(D) = g(\neg f(A))$, and finally $A, C$ are required to be complementary, so we would need 

$$A = \neg g(\neg f(A)).$$ 

In other words, $A$ would be a [[fixed point]] of a suitable operation built from direct image and complementation operators. In fact, if we find such a fixed point $A$, then the plan above would work without a hitch. 

Perhaps the simplest fixed-point theorem for this purpose on the market is

###### Lemma (Knaster--Tarski fixed-point theorem) 
Let $\phi\colon P X \to P X$ be an order-preserving map. Then there exists $A$ in $P X$ for which $\phi(A) = A$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
Let $A$ be the (internal) [[intersection]] of $U = \{T \in P X : \phi(T) \leq T\}$. Since $A \leq T$ for every $T$ in $U$, we have $\phi(A) \leq \phi(T) \leq T$ for every $T$ in $U$. Hence $\phi(A) \leq A$ by definition of $A$. Applying $\phi$ again, we get $\phi \phi(A) \leq \phi(A)$. Hence $\phi(A)$ belongs to $U$. But then $A \leq \phi(A)$ by definition of $A$.

+-- {: .num_remark #term}
###### Remark

The preceding proof is valid in _any_ topos (and so holds for $Set$ even intuitionistically). It can be seen as a specialization to posets of a result of Lambek on the [[initial algebra|initial]] [[algebra of an endofunctor]], saying that the structure maps of such initial algebras are necessarily isomorphisms. Here the initial algebra $A$ is (by construction) an initial fixed point. 

Alternatively, we could dualize the construction to get the maximal fixed point of $\phi$, instead defining $A$ to be the [[union]] of $\{T \in P X: T \leq \phi(T)\}$. This corresponds to the terminal coalgebra of an endofunctor
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of Cantor--Schroeder--Bernstein

Suppose given two monos $f: X \to Y$, $g: Y \to X$. Let $\exists_f: P X \to P Y$ denote direct image or [[existential quantification]] along $f$, and let $\neg_X: P X \to P X$ denote [[negation]]. Then the composite 

$$\phi = \neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f: P X \to P X$$ 

is order-preserving, and so has a fixed point $A$ by the Knaster-Tarski lemma. Now define $h: X \to Y$ by the rule 

$$\array{
h(x) & = & f(x) & if x \in A \\
h(x) & = & g^{-1}(x) & if x \notin A 
}$$ 

(the multi-line definition is where we use the Boolean condition). The second line makes sense because $\neg A$ is in the image of $g$. The inverse of $h$ is 

$$\array{
j(y) & = & f^{-1}(y) & if y \in \exists_f(A) \\
j(y) & = & g(y) & if y \notin \exists_f(A)
}$$

That $j$ is inverse to h uses the fact that $\neg S = \exists_g \neg \exists_f(S)$. The rest is obvious. 
=--

This classic proof is substantially the proof given in Johnstone's [[Elephant]], D4.1.11. The Boolean condition is not strictly speaking necessary, i.e., the [[principle of excluded middle]] ($EM$) does not logically follow from the Cantor--Schroeder--Bernstein statement since, for example, the latter holds vacuously (every mono is an iso) in the non-Boolean topos 

$$FinSet^C$$ 

where $C$ is any nontrivial [[finite category]]. But $EM$ is certainly the most natural supposition to make.

### Alternative construction of a fixed point {#alt}

In some schools of thought, the proof using the Knaster-Tarski lemma would be criticized because that lemma makes use of an [[impredicative]] construction. However, the application made of it in the proof of the CSB theorem is only to ensure that the operator $\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f: P X \to P X$ has a fixed point. This objection can be countered by shopping around for a different fixed-point theorem, one which is predicatively and constructively valid. 

A time-honored way of constructing a fixed point of an operator $\phi$ is by taking a limit of a sequence of iterates of $\phi$ that converges, provided that $\phi$ preserves the limit. To this end, we find that specializing Ad&aacute;mek's theorem (see [[terminal coalgebra of an endofunctor]]) suits our purposes perfectly.  

+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
If $f: X \to Y$ is monic, then the operator $\exists_f: P X \to P Y$ preserves limits of inverse chains $\omega^{op} \to P X$ (i.e. intersections of decreasing sequences). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
More generally, $\exists_f$ preserves [[connected limits]], because it lifts through the inclusion $i: P Y \downarrow \exists_f(1) \hookrightarrow P Y$ to an isomorphism $P X \stackrel{\sim}{\to} P Y \downarrow \exists_f(1)$ (here $1$ denotes the top element of $P X$, aka $X$), and $i$ preserves connected limits. 

In more detail: by [[Frobenius reciprocity]], we have $\exists_f S \wedge T = \exists_f(S \wedge f^\ast T)$ for elements $S$ of $P X$ and $T$ of $P Y$. Putting $S = 1$, we get $\exists_f 1 \wedge T = \exists_f f^\ast T$, and so the composite 

$$P Y \downarrow \exists_f 1 \stackrel{f^\ast}{\to} P X \stackrel{\exists_f}{\to} P Y \downarrow \exists_f 1$$ 

is the identity. But since $f$ is monic, $f^\ast \exists_f: P X \to P X$ is also the identity, which completes the proof. 
=-- 

Note that also $\forall_g = \neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y$ preserves such limits (it preserves *all* limits, since $g^\ast \dashv \forall_g$). So by the preceding lemma, the composite $\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f$ preserves limits of inverse chains. 

Putting now $A_0 = 1$ (the top element of $P X$), $A_1 = \neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f(1)$, and generally $A_n = (\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f)^n(1)$, we have $A_{n+1} \subseteq A_n$ (apply the monotone operator $(\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f)^n$ to the inclusion $A_1 \subseteq A_0$), and so $\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f$ preserves the intersection of the inverse chain $\ldots \subseteq A_n \subseteq \ldots \subseteq A_1 \subseteq A_0$,

$$A = \bigcap_{n \geq 0} (\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f)^n(1),$$ 

which implies that $A$ is a fixed point of $\neg_X \exists_g \neg_Y \exists_f$, as desired. In fact this $A$ is the maximal fixed point, just as in the conclusion of the Knaster-Tarski lemma, or rather its dual version mentioned in Remark \ref{term}. (Cf. [[terminal coalgebra of an endofunctor]].) 

### Beta reduced proof 

The preceding proofs are sometimes considered too abstract to easily visualize, but this is slightly misleading: the second proof, involving the construction of a maximal fixed point as a countable limit, can be "beta-reduced" to produce one of the standard "more concrete" proofs. 

In a nutshell, the maximal fixed point of the operator $\neg \exists_g \neg \exists_f: P X \to P X$ can be expressed as an alternating series of iterated direct images: 

$$X - g Y + g f X - g f g Y + g f g f X - \ldots$$ 

The meaning of this is that we have a decreasing sequence of finite alternating sums 

$$X,$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$\neg \exists_g \neg \exists_f X = X - g Y + g f X,$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$(\neg \exists_g \neg \exists_f)^2 X = X - g Y + g f X - g f g Y + g f g f X,$$

etc., and the infinite series is interpreted as the countable intersection of this decreasing sequence. The finite alternating sums are interpreted in the Boolean *ring* $P X$. 

Most of this is a routine calculation, which for the most part boils down to the following observation: 

+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
If $B, D$ are elements of $P Y$, with $D \leq B$, then $\exists_g(B - D) = \exists_g B - \exists_g D$. (With a similar statement for $\exists_f$.) 
=-- 

The proof is left to the reader, but in brief, the injectivity of $g$ implies that $\exists_g$ preserves binary intersections and relative complements. 

From here, if we write 

$$\neg \exists_g \neg \exists_f(B) = X - g(Y - f B) = X - g Y + g f B,$$ 

then it is easily verified by induction that 

$$(\neg \exists_g \neg \exists_f)^N X = \bigoplus_{j=0}^N (g f)^j X + (-1) \cdot \bigoplus_{j=0}^{N-1} g(f g)^j Y.$$ 

Now we set up a comparison with one of the "standard proofs", namely the one given in [Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem#Proof) that is attributed to Julius K&ouml;nig. We can instead consider the fixed point as a union of finitary approximations 

$$X - g Y,$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$X - g Y + g f X - g f g Y,$$ 

etc. Elements in the first set are those which have no inverse images under $g$. Elements in the second are elements in $X$ to which $(g f)^{-1}$ can be applied at most once before we hit an element of $X$ with no inverse image under $g^{-1}$. Elements in the union, i.e., in the fixed point, are those which survive at most finitely many applications of $(g f)^{-1}$ before hitting an element of $X$ with no inverse image under $g$. In the terminology of the Wikipedia article, such elements $x$ in $X$ are called "$X$-stoppers", and these are precisely the elements for which $h(x) = f(x)$, both in the present nLab article and in the Wikipedia article. The remaining $x$ (belonging to the complement of the fixed point) are mapped to $g^{-1}(x)$, according to the prescription laid out in either article. 

## Failure in toposes 

+-- {: .num_example #Top}
###### Example

Counterexample \ref{counterexample2} below shows that the CSB theorem fails in Brouwer\'s [[intuitionistic mathematics]] even for $Set$ (since every function between the sets $[0, 1]$ and $\mathbb{R}$ must be continuous by Brouwer\'s continuity principle!). See also the discussion in [Mac Lane-Moerdijk](#MM), VI.9, on toposes that realize Brouwer's theorem. 
=--

+-- {: .num_example #counterexample} 
###### Example 

As mentioned above, the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem fails in the arrow category $Set^\to$, whose objects are functions $X_0 \to X_1$ between sets and whose morphisms are commutative squares. For example, let $X$ be the object $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ that takes $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to $\mathrm{int}(n/2)$, where $\mathrm{int}(x)$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$; let $Y$ be the object $g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ that takes $n$ to $\mathrm{Int}((n+1)/2)$, where $\mathrm{Int}(x)$ is the least integer greater than or equal to $x$. Pretty clearly $X$ and $Y$ are non-isomorphic, because $g^{-1}(0)$ has cardinality $1$ whereas all fibers of $f$ have cardinality $2$. But, just by drawing pictures of these objects, it is easy to construct monomophisms $i: X \to Y$ and $j: Y \to X$ (e.g., define $i_0(n) = n+1$ and $i_1(n) = n+1$ for all $n$, and define $j_0(n) = n+1$ for $n \gt 0$, $j_0(0) = 0$, and $j_1(n) = n$ for all $n$). 
=-- 

Nor can one have internal existence of an isomorphism between $X$ and $Y$ in this last example, since internal existence implies external existence as soon as the terminal object is (externally) projective. 

## In other categories

The CSB property holds in many other [[categories]] of interest. For example: 

+-- {: .num_example #model} 
###### Example 
The CSB property holds in the category of [[vector spaces]] and in the category of [[algebraically closed field]]s. See also this [MO post](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/1058/when-does-cantor-bernstein-hold), where model-theoretic criteria come into play, sometimes under strengthenings of the notion of monomorphism (e.g., [[elementary embedding]], [[split monomorphism]]). 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_example #counterexample2} 
###### Counterexample 
On the other hand, the CSB property obviously fails in [[Top]], since we have [[embeddings]] $\mathbb{R} \cong (0,1) \to [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$, yet $[0,1] \ncong \mathbb{R}$.

In a [celebrated work](#Gowers), [[Timothy Gowers]] gave a negative solution in the case of [[Banach spaces]].


## Name

The CSB theorem was first stated by [[Georg Cantor]], but his proof relied on the [[well-ordering theorem]].  The modern (choice-free) theorem was proved (independently) by [[Felix Bernstein]] and [[Ernst SchrÃ¶der]].  It has been variously named after two or three of these in almost every possible combination, although Cantor (when mentioned at all) seems always to be mentioned first. 

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%E2%80%93Bernstein%E2%80%93Schroeder_theorem#History) reports that [[Richard Dedekind]] had an (unpublished) proof in 1887, well before any announced proofs by Cantor, Schroeder, or Bernstein in 1895, 1896, 1897 respectively.
