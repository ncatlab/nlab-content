## Definition

A [[category]] is **confluent** if for any [[span]] $B \leftarrow A \to C$, there exists a [[cospan]] $B \to D \leftarrow C$.  Note that we do not require the resulting square to [[commutative diagram|commute]].


## Remarks

If the morphisms in a category represent (sequences of) "rewriting" operations, then confluence means that any two ways to rewrite the same thing can eventually be brought back together.  This is a good property of rewriting in systems such as the [[lambda calculus]] (the [[Church-Rosser theorem]]), and as such it is a property one might expect for the hom-categories in a [[2-category|2-categorical]] model of lambda calculus.

Another good property one might want to assume is termination, i.e. the lack of infinite chains of nonidentity arrows.
