## Definition

Fix some [[scheme]] $S$.

###### Definition

the **fppf-site** (over $S$) is the [[site]] 

* whose underlying category is the category $Aff/S$ of [[affine scheme]]s [[over category|over]] $S$;

* whose [[coverage]] has as [[covering]] families $\{f : U_i \to X\}$
  those families of morphisms that are  such that 

  * each $f_i$ is a [[flat morphism]];

  * each $f_i$ is [[locally of finite presentation]];

  * we have that $X = \cup_i f_i(U_i)$.

This appears as ([de Jong, def. 27.7.1, def 27.7.6, lemma 27.7.11](#deJong)).

###### Remark


The abbreviation "fppf" is for _fidèlement plat de présentation finie_ : faithfully flat and of finite presentation. 

But notice that it is common practice, as in the above definition, to require only _local_ finite presentability.
