## Idea

A _homotopy fiber sequence_ is a "long left-[[exact sequence]]" in an [[(∞,1)-category]]. (The dual concept is that of _[[cofiber sequence]]_.)

Traditionally fiber sequences have been considered in the context of [[homotopical category|homotopical categories]] such as [[model category|model categories]] and [[category of fibrant objects|Brown category of fibrant objects]] which [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] in question. In particular, classically this was considered for [[Top]] itself. In these cases they are obtained in terms of [[homotopy pullbacks]]. Since, as discussed there, the homotopy fiber of a morphism may be computed as the ordinary 1-categorical [[fiber]] of any [[fibration]] [[resolution]] of this morphism, one often also speaks of _fibration sequences_.



## Definition
 {#Definition}

### In higher category theory

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with small [[limits]] and consider [[pointed objects]] of $C$, i.e. morphisms ${*} \to A$ from the [[terminal object]] ${*}$ ([[generalized the|the]] [[point]]) to some object $A$. All unlabeled morphisms from the point in the following are these chosen ones and all other morphisms are taken with respect to these points.

Notice that in the case that $C$ happens to be a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] for which ${*} = 0$ all objects are canonically pointed and the notions of left- and right-exact fibration sequences coincide.

But for the notion of fibration sequence to make sense, we do not need to assume that $C$ is a stable $(\infty,1)$-category. In particular, in the context of [[nonabelian cohomology]] (see [[gerbe]] and [[principal 2-bundle]]) one considers fibration sequences in non-stable $(\infty,1)$-categories.


Now let $f : A \to B$ be a morphism in $C$.

The **homotopy fiber** or **homotopy kernel** or **[[mapping cocone]]** of $f$ is [[generalized the|the]] [[pullback]] (which in our $(\infty,1)$-categorical context means [[homotopy limit|homotopy pullback]]) of the point along $f$:

$$
  \array{
     ker(f) &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

### In homotopy type theory

In [[homotopy type theory]] the homotopy fiber of a function term $f : A \to B$ over a function term $pt_B : * \to B$ is the type

$$
  \sum_{a : A} (f(a) = pt_B)
  \,,
$$

hence the [[dependent sum]] over $A$ of the [[identity type]] on $B$ with $f(a)$ and $pt_B$ [[substitution|substituted]]. (A special case of the discussion at [[homotopy pullback]])

## Long fibration sequences

A crucial difference between $\infty$-categorical fibration sequences
and ordinary 1-categorical sequences is that the former are always _long_ : in contrast to the ordinary kernel of a kernel, which is necessarily trivial, the homotopy kernel of a homotopy kernel is typically far from trivial, but is a [[loop space object]]. Due to that, each fibration sequence extend to the left by as many steps (times 3) as the objects involved have nontrivial [[homotopy group]]s.


### Kernel of a kernel: loop objects

In particular the homotopy fiber of the point ${*} \to B$ is the [[loop space object]] $\Omega B$ of $B$ (by definition):

$$
  \array{
     \Omega B &\to& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\stackrel{}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Notice that the ordinary 1-categorical [[pullback]] of a point to itself is necessarily just the point again. Much of what makes [[(∞,1)-category]]-theory richer than ordinary category theory is this fact that the kernel of the point is not trivial, but loops. This implies in particular that **the kernel of the kernel is in general nontrivial**.

Namely the homotopy kernel of the morphism $ker(f) \to A$ constructed above is by definition the homotopy limit in the diagram

$$
  \array{
    ker(ker(f)) &\to& ker(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to & A
  }
$$

This is the same kind of diagram as before, just depicted after taking its mirror image along a diagonal. The point of drawing it this way is that this suggests to form the pasting diagram with the one that defines $ker(f)$

$$
  \array{
    ker(ker(f)) &\to& ker(f) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$


Since the $(\infty,1)$-categorical pullback [satisfies the pasting law](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/limit+in+a+quasi-category#PushoutPasting) just as ordinary [[pullback]] diagrams do, it follows that the total outer square obtained this way is itself a homotopy pullback. But by definition of te [[loop space object]] $\Omega B$ this means that the kernel of the kernel is loops:

$$
  ker(ker(f)) \simeq \Omega B
  \,.
$$

I.e. all three squares in 

$$
  \array{
    \Omega B &\to& ker(f) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
$$

are (homotopy) pullback squares.

### Long fibration sequences

Continuing this way to the left, we obtain a long sequence of morphisms to the left

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  \Omega ker(f)
  \to
  \Omega A \stackrel{\bar \Omega f}{\to}
  \Omega B \to ker(f) \to A \stackrel{f}{\to} B
  \,.
$$

Here the $\bar \Omega$ indicates that the map involves reversing the direction of loops. This comes about by looking closely at the pullback diagrams that this comes from

$$
  \array{
    \Omega(A) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\bar \Omega f} && \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega B &\to& ker(f) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to &A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Again, all squares and all pasting squares appearing here are homotopy pullback squares. If I had labeled to two morphisms to the point out of the loop object one would see that $\bar \Omega f$ indeed reverses orientation of loops. 


### Long exact sequences in cohomology {#LongSequCoh}


Usually, when looking at fibration sequences in 1-categorical contexts of the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]], one doesn't see these long fibration squences directly, but only "in cohomology".

This can be usefully understood as follows:

recall from [[cohomology]] that for $X$ and $A$ objects in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ that is an [[(∞,1)-topos]], the $\infty$-groupoid of $A$-valued cocycle on $X$ is just $Hom_C(X,A)$, so that the corresponding cohomology classes are

$$
  H(X,A) = \Pi_0 Hom_C(X,A) = Ho_C(X,A)
  \,,
$$

where $Ho_C$ is the corresponding [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]].

The upshot being that in the right $(\infty,1)$-context cohomology is just the [[hom-object]].

But the [[hom-functor]] has the crucial property that it is an [[exact functor]] in both arguments. This holds for $(\infty,1)$-categories just as well as for ordinary categories. For our context this means in particular that for 

$$
  \array{
    A \times_K B &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& K
  }
$$

a homotopy pullback in $C$, for every $X \in K$ the induced diagram

$$
  \array{
     Hom_C(X,A \times_K B) &\to& Hom_C(X,B)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Hom_C(X,A) &\to& Hom_C(X,K)
  }
$$

is again homotopy pullback diagram (of [[∞-groupoids]]); in particular the morphism $Hom_C(X,A \times_K B)\to Hom_C(X,A) \times_{Hom_{C}(X,K)} Hom_C(X,B)$ induced by the universal property of homotopy pullback is an equivalence. 

So in particular for

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  \Omega \Omega B
  \to
  \Omega ker(f)
  \to
  \Omega A \stackrel{\bar \Omega f}{\to}
  \Omega B \to ker(f) \to A \stackrel{f}{\to} B
$$

a fibration sequence and for $X$ any object, there is a fibration sequence

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  Hom_C(X,\Omega \Omega B)
  \to
  Hom_C(X,\Omega ker(f))
  \to
  Hom_C(X,\Omega A) \stackrel{Hom_C(X,\bar \Omega f)}{\to}
  Hom_C(X,\Omega B) \to Hom_C(X,ker(f)) \to Hom_C(X,A) \stackrel{Hom_C(X,f)}{\to} Hom_C(X,B)
$$

is again a fibration sequence, now of $\infty$-groupoids. By projecting everything to connected components with $\Pi_0$ this then yields an ordinary long exact sequence of pointed sets


$$
  \cdots
  \to
  Ho_C(X,\Omega \Omega B)
  \to
  Ho_C(X,\Omega ker(f))
  \to
  Ho_C(X,\Omega A) \stackrel{Ho_C(X,\bar \Omega f)}{\to}
  Ho_C(X,\Omega B) \to Ho_C(X,ker(f)) \to Ho_C(X,A) \stackrel{Ho_C(X,f)}{\to} Ho_C(X,B)
  \,.
$$

Due to the identitfication of [[cohomology]] with these homotopy hom-sets via $Ho_C(X,A) =: H(X,A)$, this is a "long exact sequence in cohomology"


$$
  \cdots
  \to
  H(X,\Omega \Omega B)
  \to
  H(X,\Omega ker(f))
  \to
  H(X,\Omega A) \stackrel{H(X,\bar \Omega f)}{\to}
  H(X,\Omega B) \to H(X,ker(f)) \to H(X,A) \stackrel{H(X,f)}{\to} H(X,B)
  \,.
$$

### Long exact sequences of homotopy groups

See [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]].

## Examples

### Characterization of equivalences {#CharOfEquivalences}

We may read off from the non-triviality of the homotopy fiber $A$ of a morphism $f : B \to C$ to which extent $f$ fails to be an [[equivalence in a quasi-category|equivalence]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : B \to C$ in [[∞Grpd]] is an equivalence precisely if all its homotopy fibers over every point of $C$ are [[contractible]], i.e. are equivalent to $*$.

More generally, a morphism $f : B \to C$ in any [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is an equivalence if for all objects $X \in \mathcal{C}$ all homotopy fibers of the morphism $\mathcal{C}(X,f) : \mathcal{C}(X,B) \to \mathcal{C}(X,C)$ are contractible.

=--

For more on this see [[n-truncated object of an (∞,1)-category]]. Also [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, around example 5.5.6.13]]. For more on homotopy fibers of hom-spaces see [the section below](#OfFuncCats).


### Fiber sequences of $(\infty,1)$-functor categories {#OfFuncCats}

We have seen that for $A \to B \stackrel{f}{\to} C$ a fiber sequence in 
an $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$,
then for any other object $X$ we obtain
a fiber sequence

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,A)
  \to 
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,B)
  \stackrel{f_*}{\to}
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,C)
$$

in [[∞Grpd]], where the point of $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,C)$ is $X \to * \to C$ with $* \to C$ the point of $C$, so that $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,A)$ is the homotopy fiber over this point of the morphism given by postcomposition with $B \to C$.

Often it is important to know the homotopy fibers of $f_*$ also over other objects in $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,C)$. This is notably the case when considering [[twisted cohomology]] with coefficients in $A$.


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The homotopy fiber of  $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,B) \stackrel{f_*}{\to} Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,C)$ over a morphism $c : X \to C$ may be identified with the [[hom-object in a quasi-category|hom-object]] 

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}_{/C}}(c,f)
$$

in the [[over quasi-category|over (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/C}$.



=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 5.5.5.12]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Model all [[(∞,1)-categories]] as [[quasi-categories]]. 

Using the discussion at [[hom-object in a quasi-category]], we observe that 

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,C) \simeq \mathcal{C}_{/C} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\}
$$


and

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,B) \simeq \mathcal{C}_{/B} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\}
  \simeq \mathcal{C}_{/f} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\}
$$

under which identification the map $f_*$ is induced by the canonical

$$
  \phi''  : \mathcal{C}_{/f} \to \mathcal{C}_{/C}
  \,.
$$

So we are done if we can show that the ordinary [[pullback]] [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{  
     \mathcal{C}_{/f} \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/C}} \{c\}
     &\to& \mathcal{C}_{/f} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi'}}
     \\
     \{c\} &\to& \mathcal{C}_{/C} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\}
  }
$$

is a [[homotopy pullback]] square, because we have an isomorphism of simplicial sets

$$
  \mathcal{C}_{/f} \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/C}} \{c\}
  \simeq
  Hom^R_{\mathcal{C}_{/X}}(c,f)
  \,,
$$

as one checks.

Since in the above diagram all objects are [[Kan complex]]es, for the diagram to be a homotopy pullback it is sufficient that $\phi'$ is a [[Kan fibration]] for which in turn it is sufficient that it is a [[left fibration]]. 

That follows by noticing that the right vertical morphism fits into the pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
     \mathcal{C}_{/f} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\} &\to& \mathcal{C}_{/f}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi'}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi''}}
     \\
     \mathcal{C}_{/C} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \{X\}
     &\to&
     \mathcal{C}_{/C}
  }
  \,.
$$

But by general properties of [[left fibration]]s, the right vertical map is a left fibration. And since these are stable under pullbacks, so is $\phi'$.


=--



### Principal $\infty$-bundles

Fibration sequences are familiar from the context of [[principal bundles]].

Let $G$ be a [[group]] and let $\mathbf{B}G$ denote the corresponding one-object [[groupoid]] (in the world of [[∞-groupoids]]) or else the [[classifying space]] $\mathcal{B}G$.

Notice that 

$$
  G \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B} G
  \,.
$$

Then that a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ is classified by morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ means that it is the homotopy fiber of this morphism.

Indeed, as indicated at [[generalized universal bundle]] and at [[homotopy limit]], we may compute the homotopy pullback

$$
  \array{
  P &\to& {*}
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
 }
$$

by first forming the standard _fibrant replacement_ of the diagram $X \to \mathbf{B}G \leftarrow {*}$. That is given by
the diagram

$$
  X \to \mathbf{B}G \leftarrow \mathbf{E}G  
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbf{E}G \simeq {*}$ is the total "space" (or 2-groupoid) of the universal $G$-bundle. Once we have done this weakly equivalent replacement, the [[homotopy pullback]] may be computed as the _ordinary_ pullback

$$
  \array{
   P &\to & \mathbf{E}G
   \\
   \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   \hat X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,, 
$$

in the ordinary 1-category of $n$-groupoids or spaces, using a replacement $\hat X \stackrel{\simeq}{\twoheadrightarrow} X$ of $X$ by an acyclic fibration (called "[[hypercover]]" in this context) (for instance the Čech groupoid associated with an open cover of $X$). 

One recognizes the usual statement that principal $G$-bundles all arise as pullbacks of the universal $G$-principal bundle. 

The fact that such pullbacks really are bundles whose fiber is $G$ is the statement of the long fibration sequence induced by $g$ which says that picking any point ${*} \to X$ of $X$ and then pulling back $P$ to that point (i.e. restricting it to that point) yields $\Omega \mathbf{B}G = G$:

$$
  \array{
   G \simeq
   \Omega \mathbf{B}G
   &\to&
   P &\to & \mathbf{E}G
   \\
   \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   {*}&\stackrel{x}{\to}& \hat X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,, 
$$

The same logic -- even the same diagrams -- work for [[principal 2-bundles]] and generally for [[principal ∞-bundles]].

### Action groupoids {#ActionGroupoid}

Let $G$ be an [[∞-group]] in that $\mathbf{B}G$ is an [[∞-groupoid]] with a single object. An action of $G$ on an [[(∞,1)-category]] is an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to (\infty,1)Cat
$$

to [[(∞,1)Cat]]. This takes the single object of $\mathbf{B}G$ to some $(\infty,1)$-category  $V$.

The _[[action groupoid]]_ $V//G$ is the [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-categorical colimit]] over the action:

$$
  C//G := \lim_\to \rho
  \,.
$$

By the result [described here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/limit+in+a+quasi-category#WithValInooGrpd) this is, equivalent to the pullback of the "universal $(\infty,1)Cat$-bundle" $Z \to (\infty,1)Cat$, namely to the [[coCartesian fibration]]

$$
  \array{
    V//G &\to& Z
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\rho}{\to}& (\infty,1)Grpd
  }
$$

classified by $\rho$ under the [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]]. We obtain a [[fiber sequence]] to the left by adjoining the $(\infty,1)$-categorical pullback along the point inclusion $* \to \mathbf{B}G$

$$
  \array{
    V&\to& V//G &\to& Z
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\rho}{\to}& (\infty,1)Grpd
  }
  \,.
$$

The resulting total $(\infty,1)$-pullback rectangle is the fiber of $Z \to (\infty,1)Cat$ over the $(\infty,1)$-category $C$, which is $V$ itself, as indicated.

Notice that every fibration sequence $V \to V//G \to \mathbf{B}G$ with $V//G \to \mathbf{B}G$ a [[coCartesian fibration]] arises this way, up to equivalence.


### Integral versus real cohomology {#Integralreal}

One of the most basic fibration sequences that appears all over the place in practice is the sequence of [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]]s

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  \mathbf{B}^{n-1} \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}
  \to  
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \cdots
$$

in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]]/[[Top]], where $\mathbb{R}$ is the abelian group (under addition) of [[real number]], $\mathbb{Z}$ the abelian group of [[integer]]s, and where $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} = S^1 = U(1)$ is their [[quotient]] group, the circle group or [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ for $n=1$.

A quick way to see that this is indeed a fibration sequence is to realize that $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalent to the weak quotient [[action groupoid]] $\mathbb{R}//\mathbb{Z}$. Since everything here is in the image of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

$$
  \infty Grpd \simeq
  KanCplx
  \hookrightarrow
  sSet 
   \stackrel{\overset{U}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
  sAb
  \stackrel{\overset{\Xi}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N^\bullet}{\to}}
  Ch^+
$$

it is useful to model this fiber sequence as a sequence of [[chain complex]]es

$$
  (
  \mathbf{B}^n\mathbb{R}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}//\mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbf{B} \mathbb{Z}
  )
  \;\;\;
  =
  \;\;\;
  U \Xi
  \left(
     \left[
     \array{
       \vdots
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       0
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \mathbb{R}
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \vdots
     }
     \right]
     \;\;\;
     \to
     \;\;\;
     \left[
     \array{
       \vdots
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \mathbb{Z}
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \mathbb{R}
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \vdots
     }
     \right]
     \;\;\;
     \to
     \;\;\;
     \left[
     \array{
       \vdots
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \mathbb{Z}
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       0
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \vdots
     }
     \right]
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Written this way the second morphism is evidently a degreewise surjection, hence is a fibration in the [[model structure on chain complexes]]. Therefore this being a fibration sequence is equivalent (as described at [[homotopy pullback]]) to the first morphism being equivalent to the ordinary [[kernel]] of the second, which clearly it is.

From this fiber sequence we obtain long exact sequences in cohomology, for instance in [[singular cohomology]]: let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and for $A$ an abelian group let

$$
  H^n(X,A) := \pi_0 \infty Grpd( \Pi(X), \mathbf{B}^n A)
$$

be its cohomology with coefficients in $A$, computed in [[∞Grpd]] which we may [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] by [[sSet]], where the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ is the singular simplicial complex $Sing X$ and we have

$$
  H^n(X,A) = \pi_0 sSet(Sing X, U \Xi A[n])
  \,.
$$

Then, as discussed [above](LongSequCoh), the fiber sequence of coefficients  $
  \cdots
  \to
  \mathbf{B}^{n-1} \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}
  \to  
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \mathbb{Z}
  \to 
  \cdots
$ yields the long exact sequence in cohomology

$$
  \cdots 
  H^{n-1}(X,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})
  \to H^n(X,\mathbb{Z}) \to H^n(X,\mathbb{R}) \to 
  H^n(X,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})
  \to
  H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \to
  \cdots

In applications it often happens that one has a situation where the _real_ cohomology is trivial, i.e $H^n(X,\mathbb{R}) = 0$ in some degree $n$. In that case the exactness of the sequence

$$
  \cdots 
  \to H^n(X,\mathbb{Z}) 
  \to 0 \to 
  H^n(X,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})
  \to
  H^{n+1}(\mathbb{Z})
  \to
  0
  \to
  \cdots
$$

implies that in this case we have an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H^n(X,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H^{n+1}(\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$



### Mayer-Vietoris sequences 
 {#MayerVietoris}


A **[[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]]**  is a fiber sequence obtained from an $(\infty,1)$-pullback diagram of [[pointed objects]]:

if 

$$
  \array{
    A \times_C B &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& C
  }
$$

is an [[limit in a quasi-category|infinity-pullback]] diagram in $\mathbf{H}$, then it naturally induces a fiber sequence that starts out as

$$
  \Omega C \to A \times_C B \to A \times B
  \,.
$$

This -- or its associated [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] -- is called the _[[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]]_ of the pullback. See there for details.

#### Of a cover

The original example of Mayer-Vietoris sequences is obtained from the situtation where a [[homotopy pushout]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    U \cap V &\hookrightarrow& U
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    V &\to& X
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]]/[[Top]] is given (which modeled in [[sSet]] or in terms of [[CW-complex]]es in [[Top]] may be modeled by an ordinary pushout), and where $A \in \infty Grpd$ is some coefficient group object. Then applying the $(\infty,1)$-categorical hom $\mathbf{H}(-, A) : \mathbf{H}^{op} \to \infty Grpd$ yields the $\infty$-pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{H}(X, A) &\to& \mathbf{H}(U,A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(V,A) &\to& \mathbf{H}(U \cap V, A)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the above this is equivalent to 

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X,A) \to \mathbf{H}(U,A) \times \mathbf{H}(V,A)
  \to \mathbf{H}(U \cap V, A) 
$$

being a fibration sequence. The corresponding long exact sequence in cohomology (as discussed above) is what is traditionally called the Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the cover of $X$ by $U$ and $V$ in $A$-cohomology.
