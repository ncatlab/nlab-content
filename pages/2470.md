## Idea

In [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] one represents a [[scheme]] by an [[abelian category]] of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] on the [[scheme]]. This loses a bit of information but sometimes the information is sufficient. 

In _derived (higher) noncommutative (algebraic) geometry_ one instead considers the [[derived category]] of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]], or more precisely its [[enhanced triangulated category|dg-enhancement]] or [[A-infinity-category|A-infinity-enhancement]]; dg-enhancements for the derived categories of quasiprojective smooth varieties are essentially unique. 

In general one represents complex noncommutative spaces by [[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated dg-categories]]. This is well into [[homotopy theory]] area. Quillen [[model category]] structures and [[homotopy limit]]s in this context were studied by a number of people (including the impressive thesis by Tabuada). On the other hand, over a mixed characteristics, the meaning of such representations is less well understood.

Derived noncommutative geometry has been introduced by Kapranov-Bondal and later Orlov around 1990; contemporary main works belong also to [[Kontsevich]], Lunts, van den Bergh, Katzarkov, Kuznetsov and Kaledin. Some of the works of [[Bertrand Toen|Toen]], Vaquie, Keller  are properly in this area as well. 

## Definitions

In 

* L. Katzarkov, M. Kontsevich, T. Pantev, _Hodge theoretic aspects of mirror symmetry), [arxiv:0806.0107](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0806.0107).

the following definition is given.

###### Definition (graded complex noncommutative space)

A __graded complex nc-space__ is a $\mathbb{C}$-linear [[dg-category|differential graded category]] $C$ which is homotopy complete and cocomplete (has all [[homotopy limit]]s and colimits). 

=--

The [[derived category|derived categories]] of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] on a [[scheme]] over $Spec(\mathbb{C})$ is one of the examples; another example is the category of dg-modules over a fixed [[dg-algebra]] $A$, which are such that $A$ admits an exhaustive filtration
such that the associated graded is a sum of shifts of $A$.
Call that category $A$-$Mod$. 

Kontsevich calls a complex differential $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded algebra 

* __smooth__ if $A$ is a perfect object in the category of $A$-$A$-dg-bimodules (perfect object here means that $Hom(A,-)$ preserves small homotopy colimits); 

* __compact__ if the total complex dimension of its cohomology $H^\bullet(A,d_A)$ is finite

The category $A$-$Mod$ is a smooth (resp. compact) nc space if the underlying dg-algebras $A$ is; this notion depends on the category and not on the underlying dg-algebra. 

The above definition implies that a category $C$ which represents a nc-space in the sense above is [[triangulated category|triangulated]] and [[Karoubi envelope|Karoubi closed]]. Sometimes this are requirements in another variant of the definition.

###### Definition (noncommutative space (M. Kontsevich))

A __noncommutative space__ $X$ is a small [[triangulated category]] $C_X$ which is [[Karoubi envelope|Karoubi closed]] (=every [[idempotent]] is a [[split idempotent]]) and appropriately [[enriched category|enriched]] over either

* [[spectrum|spectra]] $Hom_{C_X}(E,F[i])=\pi_{-i}\mathbf{Hom}_{C_X}(E,F)$

* [[chain complex|complexes]] of $k$-vector spaces (i.e. is a [[dg-category]]): $Hom(E,F[i])= H^i(\mathbf{Hom}_{C_X}(E,F))$. $C_X$ is $k$-linear over a field $k$ and one writes $X/k$. If instead $k$ is replaced by a ring $R$ then one enriches over complexes of $R$-modules which are [[model structure on chain complexes|cofibrant]].
