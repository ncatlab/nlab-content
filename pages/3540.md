I'm a mathematical physicist interested in foundational issues, particularly in relation to quantum theory.  I'm a "big picture" thinker which is why categories appeal to me.  I'm relatively new to category theory itself but I'm slowly getting there.

In other news, I'm a department chair (God help me) and program director at a small college in New Hampshire.  You can get my life story from from my blog [Quantum Moxie](http://quantummoxie.wordpress.com/).

You can e-mail me at idurham [at] anselm [dot] edu.

I'm really interested in collaborating with people which is what attracted me to this site.
