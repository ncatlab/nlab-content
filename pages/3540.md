I'm a mathematical physicist interested in foundational issues, particularly in relation to quantum theory.  I'm a "big picture" thinker which is why categories appeal to me.  I'm relatively new to category theory itself but I'm slowly getting there.

I'm an Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Physics at [Saint Anselm College](http://www.anselm.edu).  I live on the coast of Maine with my wife, two pre-teen kids, dog, and a tankful of guppies.  

I've had a blog, [Quantum Moxie](http://quantummoxie.wordpress.com/), for about four years that is a dumping ground for things that don't otherwise fit inside my brain.

You can e-mail me at idurham [at] anselm [dot] edu.

I'm really interested in collaborating with people which is what attracted me to this site.
