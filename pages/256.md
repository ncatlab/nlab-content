An __endomorphism__ of an [[object]] $x$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[morphism]] $f : x \to x$.  An endomorphism that is also an [[isomorphism]] is called an [[automorphism]].

Given an object $x$, the endomorphisms of $x$ form a [[monoid]] under [[composition]], the __endomorphism monoid__ of $x$:

$$
  End_C(x) = Hom_C(x,x)
,$$ 

which may be written $End(x)$ if the category $C$ is understood.  

Up to equivalence, every monoid is an endmorphism monoid; see [[delooping]].
