## Idea

_L&#246;b's theorem_ in its original form is a generalization of the [[Gödel incompleteness theorem]] whose formulation lends itself to the tools of [[type theory]] and [[modal logic]].

L&#246;b's theorem states that to prove that a [[proposition]] is [[provability logic|provable]], it is sufficient to prove the proposition under the assumption that it  is  provable.  Since the  [[Curry-Howard isomorphism]] identifies [[formal proofs]] with abstract [[syntax]] trees of [[programs]]; L&#246;b's theorem implies, for total [[languages]] which validate it, that self-interpreters are impossible. ([Gross-Gallagher-Fallenstein 16](#GrossGallagherFallenstein16))

In [[provability logic]] the abstract statement is considered in itself as an [[axiom]] on a [[modal operator]] $\Box$ interpreted as the [[modality]] "is provable". In this form the statement reads formally:

$$
  \Box(\Box P \to P) \to \Box P
$$ 

for any [[proposition]] $P$ ("L&#246;b's axiom").

This reduces to an [[incompleteness theorem]] when taking $P = $ [[false]] and using that 

1. [[negation]] is $\not P = (P \to false)$;

1. [[consistency]] means that $\Box P \to \not \Box \not P$


$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & \Box (\Box false \to false) \to \Box false
    \\
    \Rightarrow \;\; & \Box ( \not \Box false ) \to \Box false
    \\
    \Rightarrow \;\;
    & \Box ( \not \Box false ) \to \not \Box \not false
    \\ 
    \Rightarrow \;\;
    & \Box ( \not \Box false ) \to false
    \\
    \Rightarrow \;\;
    & \not \Box \not \Box false
  \end{aligned}
$$

Where the last line reads in words "It is not provable that false is not provable."
