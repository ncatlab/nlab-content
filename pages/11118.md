A **graded unitary monoid** $\Phi$ in a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is the data of

* for each $n \in \mathbf{N}$, an [[object]] $\Phi_n$,
* for each $m,n \in \mathbf{N}$, a [[morphism]]
  $$ \Phi_m \times \Phi_n \to \Phi_{m+n} $$
such that the obvious [[associativity]] and [[unit]] [[axioms]] hold.

## Examples

* In the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[groups]] with the [[cartesian product]], two examples of graded monoids are the trivial one $1 = (1)_n$ and the **graded monoid of symmetric groups** $\Sigma = (\Sigma_n)_n$.
