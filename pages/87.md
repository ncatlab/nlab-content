## Idea

A basic fact in ordinary [[category theory]] is that a [[functor]] $f\colon C \to D$ is an [[equivalence of categories]] -- in that there is a functor $g\colon D \to C$ and natural isomorphisms $f \circ g \simeq Id_D$ and $g \circ f \simeq Id_C$ -- precisely if it is an [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] [[full and faithful functor]].

But this statement does crucially depend on the [[axiom of choice]]: the functor $g$ is obtained by _choosing_  for each [[object]] $d \in D$ an object $c \in C$ such that $f(c) \simeq d$. 

The notion of _anafunctor_ , introduced by Makkai, is a modification of the notion of _functor_ such that even in the absence of the axiom of choice, the statement remains true that an anafunctor is an [[equivalence of categories]] precisely if it is essentially surjective and full and faithful.

Since questions concerning the axiom of choice tend to look a bit esoteric to those not actively interested in questions of [[foundations]], it is helpful to think of this more generally in terms of [[internal category]] theory, where the concept is of independent use and in fact well known by other names than "anafunctor":

consider some ambient category $\mathcal{E}$ [[internalization|internal]] to which we want to do category theory. A good example to keep in mind is the category [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s. The axiom of choice does fail in [[Top]], but for a very non-esoteric reason: in the simple sense that not every continous [[epimorphism]] $P \to X$ between topological spaces has a _continuous_ [[section]].

Then it may easily happen that an internal functor $f\colon C \to D$ between [[internal category|internal categories]] in $\mathcal{E}$ (for instance between topological categories) is [[k-surjective functor|k-surjective]] for all $k$, but still does not admit a weak inverse in $\mathcal{E}$. 
For instance the functor $C(U) \to X$ from a [[Cech nerve|Cech groupoid]] associated to an open [[cover]] $U = \coprod_i U_i$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is [[k-surjective functor|k-surjective]] for all $k$ in $\mathcal{E} = Top$, but in general does not admit a weak inverse, simply because the continuous function $\coprod_i U_i \to X$ does not have a continuous section, unless one of the $U_i$ is already equal to $X$. Entirely analogously, Makkai considered $\mathcal{E} = Set_{\not C}$ to be the category [[Set]] of [[set]]s without the [[axiom of choice]], where the same may happen: not every [[k-surjective functor]] for all $k$ has a weak inverse.

There is a standard way to deal with such situations where we are faced with a category -- here the category $Cat(\mathcal{E})$ of categories internal to $\mathcal{E}$ -- some of whose morphisms look like they ought to have inverses, but do not: we call these would-be invertible morphisms _weak equivalences_ such that our category becomes a [[category with weak equivalences]] or a [[homotopical category]]. Then we pass to the corresponding [[homotopy category]]: the universal "improvement" of our category such that all the would-be invertible morphism do become invertible.

Here we take the weak equivalences in $Cat(\mathcal{E})$ to be the internal functors that are internally [[k-surjective functor|k-surjective]] for all $k$. It turns out that this choice of weak equivalences is particularly well-behaved in that it actually forms a [[calculus of fractions]]. Due to the early work on abstract [[homotopy theory]] by Gabriel and Zisman, there is simple explicit construction of the corresponding [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Cat(\mathcal{E}))$ in this case: the objects are the same as those of $Cat(E)$ -- hence [[internal category|categories internal to]] $\mathcal{E}$ for us -- and the morphisms $f\colon C \to D$ are [[span]]s of morphism in $Cat(\mathcal{E})$

$$
  \array{
    \hat C &\stackrel{\hat f}{\to}& D
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in W}}
    \\
    C
  }
  \,,
$$

where the left leg is a weak equivalence., hence for us: where the left leg is an internal functor that is $k$-surjective for all $k$.  (This is the beginning of the construction of the [[Dwyer-Kan localization]] at our chosen weak equivalences.)

For the case $\mathcal{E} = Top$ such a span is a morphism out of a _Cech cover_ . For instance for $C = X$ a topological space regarded as a topological category, for $G$ a [[topological group]] and $D = \mathbf{B}G$ its [[delooping]] one-object topological groupoid, such a span is a [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] on $X$ with values in $G$.

And finally: for the case that $\mathcal{E} = Set_{\not C}$ is the category of sets without the axiom of choice, such a span is an **anafunctor**: a functor $\hat C \to C$ that is is surjective on objects and [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]], together with a functor $\hat C \to D$ out of the "resolution" of $C$.

So one can understand ordinary anafunctors as follows:

1. first we consider that the [[axiom of choice]] may fail, 
   which makes previously invertible functors  non-invertible;
   
1. then we universally _force_ the now non-invertible functors 
   to become invertible after all,
   by throwing in formal inverses for them.
   
   
Under the name anafunctors these concepts were first developed by [[Michael Makkai]] to do ordinary category theory with a [[foundations]] that does not include the axiom of choice. Later they were applied by [[Toby Bartels]] to [[internal category|internal categories]], where the axiom of choice is simply not an option. These actually turned out to be known already (at least up to equivalence) in some contexts, in particular as [[Hilsum-Skandalis morphism]]s between [[Lie groupoid]]s.


Every functor may be interpreted as an anafunctor; that every anafunctor is equivalent to a functor is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], in which case the inclusion of functors into anafunctors is in fact an [[equivalence of categories]]. But if you ignore functors and deal only with anafunctors (or saturated anafunctors), then the theory is entirely [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] (without using the axiom of choice or even [[excluded middle]]). Theorems that classically required choice now don\'t require choice (and indeed become constructive) with anafunctors. Thus, anafunctors (or even saturated anafunctors) are the correct notion to use if you are a constructivist (at least as long as you [[foundations|found]] mathematics on some sort of [[set theory]] at all); but they are also often the correct notion to use in [[internal category]] theory.


## Definitions

Given categories $C$ and $D$, an __anafunctor__ $F\colon C \to D$ may be rather slickly defined as a [[span]] of ordinary ([[strict functor|strict]]) [[functors]] $C \overset{\sigma}\leftarrow \overline{F} \overset{\tau}\rightarrow D$ (where $\overline{F}$ is some category), with the property that the functor $\sigma\colon {\overline{F}} \to C$ is both [[faithful functor|faithful]] and (strictly!) surjective on both objects and morphisms (therefore both [[full functor|full]] and [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective on objects]]).  It is also possible to define an anafunctor as a span in which $\sigma$ is merely a [[equivalence of categories|weak equivalence]] (that is, faithful, full, and essentially surjective on objects), although that is slightly more complicated to work with.

In more explicit detail, an __anafunctor__ $F\colon C \to D$ consists of:
* a set $|F|$ of __specifications__ of $F$ (which corresponds to the set of objects of $\overline{F}$);
* maps $\sigma\colon |F| \to C$ and $\tau\colon |F| \to D$ (taking values in objects). Given $x\colon C$ and $y\colon D$, we say that $y$ is a __specified value__ of $F$ at $x$ if, for some $s\colon |F|$, $x = \sigma(s)$ and $y = \tau(s)$; in this case, $s$ __specifies__ $y$ as a value of $F$ at $x$, and we write $F_s(x) = y$.  That is,
  $$ F_s(x) \coloneqq \tau(s) .$$
  We say that $y$ is a __value__ of $F$ at $x$ if $y$ is isomorphic (in $D$) to some specified value of $F$ at $x$; we write $F(x) \cong y$. (There is no notion of *the* value of $F$ at $x$, except in the up-to-isomorphism sense of the [[generalised the]], and $F(x) = y$ is a meaningless statement.);
* for each $s, t\colon |F|$ and morphism $f\colon \sigma(s) \to \sigma(t)$ in $C$, a morphism
  $$ F_{s,t}(f)\colon F_s(x) \to F_t(y) $$
  in $D$, where $x \coloneqq \sigma(s)$ and $y \coloneqq \tau(s)$. Similarly to the above, we can define whether a given morphism $g$ in $D$ is a __specified value__ of $F$ at a given morphism $f$ in $C$ or whether $g$ is (merely) a __value__ of $F$ at $f$. (Again, there is no notion of *the* value of $F$ at $f$.);
* $\sigma$ is a [[surjective function]]. Thus, $F$ has *some* value at any given object or morphism of $C$. (In the [[internalization|internalized]] case, this requirement can become quite complicated; for example, internal to [[Diff]], one requires a [[surjective submersion]].);
* $F$ preserves [[identity morphism|identities]]. That is, given $s\colon |F|$, the value of $F$ specified by $s$ and $s$ at the identity of $\sigma(s)$ is the identity of $\tau(s)$, or (in symbols) $F_{s,s}(\id_{\sigma(s)}) = \id_{\tau(s)}$, or (whenever this makes sense)
  $$ F_{s,s}(\id_x) = \id_{F_s(x)} ;$$
* $F$ preserves [[composition]]. That is, given $s, t, u\colon |F|$, $f\colon \sigma(s) \to \sigma(t)$, and $g\colon \sigma(t) \to \sigma(u)$,
  $$ F_{s,u}(f;g) = F_{s,t}(f);F_{t,u}(g) .$$
  (Here the semicolon indicates composition in the anti-Leibniz order.).

From the above explicit data, the category $\overline{F}$ is constructed as follows: the objects of $\overline{F}$ are the elements of $|F|$, while a morphism $s \to t$ in $\overline{F}$ is simply a morphism $\sigma(s) \to \sigma(t)$ in $C$.  Then $\sigma$ extends to a surjective faithful functor from $\overline{F}$ to $C$ (acting as the identity on morphisms), and $\tau$ extends to a functor from $\overline{F}$ to $D$ (mapping the morphism $f\colon s \to t$ in $\overline{F}$ to $F_{s,t}(f)\colon \tau(s) \to \tau(t)$ in $D$).

An anafunctor $F$ is __saturated__ if, whenever $F(x) \cong y$, $F_s(x) = y$ for some unique specification $s$, where the unicity of $s$ depends not only on $x$ and $y$ but also on how $y$ is a value of $F$ at $x$. To be precise: if $g\colon y' \to y$ is an isomorphism in $D$ and $F_{s'}(x) = y'$ for some specification $s'$, then there is a unique specification $s$ such that $F_{s',s}(\id_x) = g$ (where in particular, $\sigma(s) = x$ and $F_s(x) = y$). Every anafunctor $F\colon C \to D$ has a _saturation_ $\overline{F}$; $\overline{F}$ is a saturated anafunctor and $F \cong \overline{F}$ in the category of anafunctors from $C$ to $D$. In fact, the inclusion of the saturated anafunctors into the anafunctors (as a full subcategory) is an equivalence of categories (given fixed $C$ and $D$).

Categories, anafunctors, and a suitably defined notion of [[ananatural transformation]] between them form a [[bicategory]] $Cat_{ana}$; an internal [[equivalence]] in this 2-category is called an **anaequivalence**.  Every functor may be interpreted as an anafunctor, with $|F|$ always taken to be (the set of objects in) $C$ itself and $\sigma$ the [[identity functor]].  Indeed, there is a [[2-functor]] to $Cat_{ana}$ from the [[strict 2-category]] $Str Cat$ of categories, functors and natural transformations; this functor is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] if and only if the [[axiom of choice]] holds.  Thus, most mathematicians will identify $Cat_{ana}$ and $Str Cat$ as simply [[Cat]], the $2$-category of categories; however, mathematicians who doubt the axiom of choice will distinguish them.  While anafunctors exist in any case, there is an ideological statement that may be implied by their use: that $Cat$ is *really* $Cat_{ana}$ rather than $Str Cat$.

In any case, (modulo "size issues" which one may want to impose) the inclusion of $Str Cat$ into $Cat_{ana}$ has a right adjoint, described using [[clique]]s. Accordingly, we can instead define anafunctors by means of clique categories, taking an anafunctor from $C$ into $D$ to be a genuine functor from $C$ into $Clique(D)$ (and the category of anafunctors as the Kleisli category for the $Clique(-)$ monad, with natural transformations between anafunctors being simply natural transformations of the corresponding genuine functors into $Clique(D)$).

## Internal anafunctors

We generalise the slick definition of anafunctors as spans rather than the detailed definition involving specified values.

Let $S$ be a category containing a collection of morphisms called "covers" such that

* every [[isomorphism]] is a cover,
* covers are closed under composition,
* any [[pullback]] of a cover exists and is a cover ([[pullback stability]]),
* every cover is the [[quotient object]] of its [[kernel pair]], i.e. is an [[effective epimorphism]].  (Since all pullbacks of covers exist, this is equivalent to saying that every cover is a [[regular epimorphism]].)

Note that these are precisely the axioms saying that the singleton families $\{p\colon V\to U\}$ where $p$ is a cover form a [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]] [[Grothendieck pretopology]].  One important class of examples is when $S$ is a [[regular category]] and the covers are the [[regular epimorphisms]].  Another is when $S$ is the category of smooth manifolds and the covers are the surjective submersions.

In such a situation, if $C$ and $D$ are [[internal category|internal categories]] in $S$, we define an __anafunctor__ $C\to D$ to consist of a span $C\leftarrow F \to D$ of internal functors such that:

1. $F_0\to C_0$ (the map of objects) is a cover.

2. $F\to C$ is [[ff morphism|fully-faithful]], in the internal sense that the following is a pullback square:
$$\array{F_1 & \to & C_1 \\ \downarrow && \downarrow \\ F_0\times F_0&   \to & C_0\times C_0}$$

Note that assuming $F_0\to C_0$ is a cover, so is $F_0\times F_0\to C_0\times C_0$ (it is a composition of pullbacks of $F_0\to C_0$); thus the above pullback always exists.

By the remarks above, if $S$ is [[Set]] and "cover" means "[[surjection]]" (an example where the covers are the regular epimorphisms), then we recover the original external notion of ([[small category|small]]) anafunctor.  An anafunctor, defined in this way, is saturated just when the map $core(F) \to core(C\times D)$ of [[cores]] is an [[isofibration]], so we need an internal notion of core to define saturated anafunctors internally.  An anafunctor is an anaequivalence when $F\to D$ is fully faithful and a cover on objects; for [[Lie groupoids]], these are the [[Morita equivalences]].

If $C\leftarrow F \to D$ and $C\leftarrow G \to D$ are internal anafunctors, we define an __[[ananatural transformation]]__ between them (or simply a _natural transformation_, given the context) to be a [[natural transformation]] between the two induced internal natural transformations $F\times_C G \to D$.  We can then prove that internal categories, anafunctors, and natural transformations form a [[bicategory]].  (Interestingly, you may need the axiom of choice in the [[metalogic]] to conclude this, depending on whether there is a natural way to choose the necessary pullbacks; else you get an [[anabicategory]], in which the composition functors are anafunctors.)

The role of the assumptions about covers is:

* Identity maps must be covers in order to have identity anafunctors (and more generally, for every functor to give rise to an anafunctor).
* To compose anafunctors by pullback, the pullbacks of covers must exist and be covers, and covers must be closed under composition.
* To define $F \times_C G$ and obtain a notion of natural transformation, we again need covers to have pullbacks.
* To define composition of natural transformations between anafunctors, we need covers to be effective; see diagram (118) in [HGT1](#HGT1).

Note: in Section 1.1.5 of [HGT1](#HGT1), the following additional axiom was assumed on the class of covers:

* every [[congruence]] involving a cover has a quotient object which is a cover.

This is not needed for anafunctors but is used to relate descent to bundles (and then to $2$-bundles).


## Homotopy-theoretic interpretation

Observe that the surjective-on-objects equivalences are precisely the [[model category|acyclic fibrations]] for the [[folk model structure]] on [[Cat]].  Therefore, anafunctors can be identified with the "one-step generalized morphisms" in $Cat$ whose first leg is not just a [[weak equivalence]] but an acyclic fibration.  However, it appears that the folk model structure on Cat only exists (with its weak equivalences being the fully faithful and essentially surjective maps) under the assumption of some choice---though full AC is not needed, [[COSHEP]] suffices.

More generally, it is proven in [EKV](#EKV) that if $S$ has a Grothendieck coverage, then under suitable additional conditions on $S$ (and, of course, the axiom of choice assumed external to $S$), there is a [[model category|model structure]] on the category $Cat(S)$ of internal categories in $S$ relative to that coverage.  The internal anafunctors relative to the given coverage, as defined above, can then once again be identified with the spans whose first leg is an acyclic fibration.

Since all objects in the folk model structure on Cat are fibrant, according to Kenneth Brown's theorem in [[homotopical cohomology theory]] it follows that one-step generalized morphisms already realize the full localization, i.e. they represent all morphisms in the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Cat)$.

If we specialize to groupoids, with their folk model structure by Brown-Golasinski, then by the general idea of [[homotopical cohomology theory]]
this means that anafunctors between groupoids represent [[nonabelian cocycle]]s on groupoids with values in groupoids. By the notion of [[descent|codescent]] such homotopical cocycles are related to [[descent|descent data]] that enters the definition of [[sheaf|sheaves]] and [[stack]]s.


## Questions of size {#SizeQuestions}

In general, it seems that even if $C$ and $D$ are [[small categories]], then the category $Ana(C,D)$ of anafunctors from $C$ to $D$ is not necessarily even essentially small, and thus the 2-category $Cat_{ana}$ of categories and anafunctors is not [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

This is true, however, under the assumption of COSHEP, since in that case (as above) anafunctors represent maps in $Ho(Cat)$, which is locally small by general model category theory.  More specifically, under COSHEP every anafunctor $C\leftarrow F \to D$ is equivalent to one where the set of objects of $F$ is $C_0'$, where $C_0'\to C_0$ is a projective cover of the set $C_0$ of objects of $C$.

COSHEP is actually stronger than necessary for this; all that is really needed is [[WISC]], i.e. for any set $X$, the full subcategory of $Set/X$ consisting of surjections has a [[weakly initial set]].  For in that case, any anafunctor $C\leftarrow F \to D$ is equivalent to one where the set of objects of $F$, equipped with its surjection to $C_0$, belongs to the weakly initial set.  Note that COSHEP implies WISC, as do the [[axiom of multiple choice]] and the axiom of [[small violations of choice]].

In Makkai's paper referenced below, he proves that $Ana(C,D)$ is small under the assumption of his [[small cardinality selection axiom]], which also follows from SVC.  It is not obvious, however, what the [[structural set theory|structural]] counterparts of these two axioms might be.  Although they carry the same feel that "choice is violated only in a small way," Makkai's proof from SCSA is an "injective" approach, in that the set of possibilities for the objects of $F$ is constructed mainly from $D$, rather than purely from $C$ as in the "projective" approach above using COSHEP or WISC.


## Generalizations

### Higher versions 

Since the [[folk model structure]] on $Cat$ extends to $\omega$-[[strict omega-category|categories]], also the anafunctor concept generalizes to these strict [[higher category theory|higher categories]]. Indeed, again by Brown-Golasinski, strict $\omega$-groupoids are fibrant with respect to the [[folk model structure]], so that the corresponding $\omega$-[[schreiber:omega-anafunctors|anafunctors] between $\omega$-groupoids represent cocycles in [[nonabelian cohomology]].

More details on $\omega$-anafunctors are described in the context of [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology]] in the private area of the $n$Lab. See [[schreiber:omega-anafunctor]].

### Additive version

The notion of abelian [[butterfly]] introduced by Behrang Noohi [Weak maps of 2-groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0506313) is the additive version of the notion of (saturated) anafunctor: the equivalence between, on the one hand, internal groupoids and internal functors and, on the other hand, arrows and commutative squares in an abelian category extends to an equivalence between saturated anafunctors and butterflies.

_Urs says:_ Why do you restrict this to the abelian case? From 
[page  16](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0506/0506313v3.pdf#page=16)  of Noohi's article I got the impression that he is precisely describing the ana-2-functors between one-object 2-groupoids in terms of the corresponding (possibly nonabelian) crossed modules. 

_Mathieu says:_ I don't see that (or something like that) on that page, but saturated anafunctors should correspond to butterflies also in the semi-abelian case (using the notion of internal crossed module in a semi-abelian category introduced by Janelidze), but I have not checked it.  The special case of groups is probably easy to check: saturated anafunctors between two internal groupoids in the category of groups should correspond to butterflies between the corresponding crossed modules.

_Urs says:_ I haven't checked the details. But he is looking at derived homs of crossed complexes. By general nonsense these derived hom should be given by homs out of cofibrant replacements. This is another way of talking about the anafunctor picture. Somebody should check the details.

[[Tim Porter|Tim]]: Noohi has pointed out to me a slip in his HHA article in which he gives an 'algebraic' description of weak map (and thus of anafunctor) between the crossed modules corresponding to the 2-groups.  He has posted a corrected version on the archive (<http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0506313v3>, but make sure you get version 3).

## Discussion

The following discussion was about the effect of different notions of [[coverage]] on the definition of and operations on anafunctors.

+-- {: .query}

[[David Roberts]] says: If one uses a coverage, then composing anafunctors means a choice has to be made in the filler of $U \to D_0 \leftarrow V$ with the right map a cover. Presumably the resulting bicategory of anafunctors is independent, up to biequivalence, of the choices made. Also, at the very least the identity map has to be a cover, so as to define the identity anafunctor. 

DR says: Well I suppose we could follow Makkai's philosophy twice and have a composition anafunctor (in the original sense) for composing anafunctors (in the internal sense) and end up with an anabicategory.

_Mike_: Yes, presumably it won't depend on the fillers chosen; I haven't checked the details, though.  "Grothendieck coverage" means the same as "Grothendieck topology" and thus includes closure under lots of things, including composition and containing identities.

_David R_: I noticed the adjective Grothendieck in the preceeding sentence half-way through asking the question, but I think my point still holds for general coverages, without the closure properties.

_Mike_: Well, as you pointed out, you need at least identity maps to be covers to have identity anafunctors, and you need covers to be stable under composition, as well as pullback, in order to define composition of anafunctors.  An arbitrary coverage might not satisfy those, although pretty much any coverage arising in practice does.  The other point that a choice has to be made unless you have honest pullback-stability is certainly true.  So probably the most natural-feeling context in which to work is a (possibly singleton) [[Grothendieck pretopology]].  I would be happy for this page to ignore the case where covers don't have pullbacks; I did some rewriting above to reflect this discussion.  I think this discussion could now be deleted; feel free to do so if you agree.

_David R_: After some thought, one could do without _the_ identity anafunctor, and be satisfied with a anafunctor (of the external variety) giving the identity: $1 \to Ana(X,X)$. I think I should move this discussion to a section of its own, and develop these ideas there. As an aside, I think I saw an example of a non-Grothendieck coverage in John and Alex's [[generalized smooth space|smooth spaces]] paper.

_Toby_: You only get an anabicategory anyway, because of the choice of pullbacks (unless the structure of the coverage fixes these, as can be done in $Set$).

Anafunctors really should make sense in any [[site]] whatsoever (as long as we can compose ananatural transformations, which I guess we can if the site is subcanonical).  The trick of getting away with single maps (as one can do, for example, in a superextensive site) is not really necessary.  In fact, using a coverage makes the definitions, while more complicated, really look more natural in topological categories.
