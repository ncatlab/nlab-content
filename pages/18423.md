## Idea

Given a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, then then [[shape modality|shape]] $&#643; X$ of any object $X$ behaves like the [[path ∞-groupoid]] of $X$. For some $\mathbf{H}$ this is true verbatim, in that the shape operation is represented by a geometric [[singular simplicial complex]]

$$
  &#643; X 
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\im}_n Maps(\Delta^n, X)
  \,,
$$ 

where on the right we have a [[homotopy colimit]] over [[internal homs]] from a cohesive incarnation of the [[n-simplex]] into $X$.


This is true for instance for the case

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] 

This is due to ([Pavlov, theorem 0.2](#Pavlov)). For $X$ a [[stable homotopy type]] in the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] $T Smooth\infty Grpd$ this was observed in [Bunke-Nikolaus-Voelkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)
