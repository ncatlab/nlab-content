## Idea

A _projective presentation_ of an [[object]] is a realization of that object as a suitable [[quotient]] of a [[projective object]]. 

In [[homological algebra]] projective presentations can sometimes be used in place of genuine [[projective resolutions]] in the computation of [[derived functors]]. See for instance at _[[Ext-functor]]_ for examples.

The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of [[injective presentation]].

## Definition

### In abelian categories

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]]. For $X \in \mathcal{A}$ any [[object]], a _projective presentation_ of $X$ is a [[short exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  0 \to N \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow}
  P \stackrel{p}{\to}
  X \to 0
  \,,
$$

hence exhibiting $X$ as the [[cokernel]]

$$
  X \simeq coker(N \hookrightarrow P)
$$

such that  $P$ is a [[projective object]].
