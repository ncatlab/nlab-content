## Idea

While [[Peter Scholze]]'s presentations of [[condensed mathematics]] only talks about H-$\mathbb{Z}$-module spectra in [[derived geometry]], theoretically one should be able to extend it to general spectra in [[spectral geometry]]. 

## Definition

A **condensed E-infiity-ring** is a [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]] of [[E-infinity-rings]] on the [[pro-Ã©tale (infinity,1)-site]] of the point, small relative to a universe $\mathcal{U}$.
