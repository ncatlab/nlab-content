[[directed homotopy theory|Directed homotopy]] theory is the study of '[[directed space]]s' of various types.  As these occur in various different contexts and the variants being considered are not always simply related, it seems a good idea to discuss some of those 'contexts' so as to gain some hold on the intuitions _external_ to the usual contexts of the  n-Lab and hence to see if that will enable use of techniques from the Lab  to help understand those contexts and similarly to suggest new problems and interpretations within the n-Lab contexts.

##Contexts for directed homotopy

*  Evolving spaces;  

* [[Models for concurrency]];

* [[Topological Data Analysis]] and [[persistent homology]];

* Models for mixed temporal-spatial [[modal logics]];

* [[causal sets]], discrete models for space time and [[causal models]] in Computer Science, Physics and Systems Biology;

* models for multi-agent systems, [[multimodal logics]].

The problems thrown up by these contexts will not always lead to the same notion of directed homotopy, so we need a reasonably flexible general definition, one that can be specialised to particular contexts later on.
