A __torsion theory__ in an [[abelian category]] $A$ is a couple $(T,F)$ of additive subcategories called the __torsion class__ $T$ and the __torsion free class__ $F$ such that the following conditions hold:

* $Hom(T,F) = 0$

(in other words $A(X,Y) = 0$ if $X \in Ob T$ and $Y\in Ob F$.

* $Hom(T,Y) = 0 \Rightarrow Y\in Ob Y$

* $Hom(X,F) = 0 \Rightarrow X\in Ob X$

* for all $X\in Ob A$, there exists $Y\subset X$, $Y\in Ob T$ and $X/Y\in Ob F$

If the abelian category satisfies the Gabriel's [[property (sup)]] then for every object $X$ there exist the largest subobject $t(X)\subset X$ called the torsion part of $X$. Under the axiom of choice, $t: X\to t(X)$ can be extended to a functor. 

A torsion theory is __hereditary__ if $T$ is closed under subobjects, or equivalently, 
$t$ is [[left exact functor]]. 

The basic example of a torsion class is the class of torsion abelian groups within the category of all abelian groups. The torsion theories are often used as a means to formulate localization theory in abelian categories.
