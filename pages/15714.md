
A lattice group is a [[set]] with compatible [[lattice]] and [[group]] structures.

This should not be confused with a lattice in group theory (which is a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[subgroup]] of the additive group of a [[topological vector space]]).

Somebody should write down the compatibility requirements!
