## Idea

The construction called _Bohrification_ by some authors is a generalization of [[Gelfand duality]] for commutative [[C-star algebra]]s to a context of _noncommutative_ $C^*$-algebras. It assigns to a noncommutative $C^*$-algebra $A$ a generalized [[Gelfand spectrum]] in the form of a [[locale]] $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ [[internalization|internal]] to the [[sheaf topos]] $\mathcal{T}_A$ over the [[semilattice of commutative subalgebras]] of $A$, or  equivalently its externalization $\Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)$ regarded as a [[locale]] [[over category|over]] the locale of open subalgebras.

When applied to subalgebras of [[bounded operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] this construction has been suggested to formalize faithfully and usefully a heuristic that has goes back to [[Nils Bohr]] and is known as the _doctrine of classical concepts_ ([Scheibe](#Scheibe)) in [[quantum mechanics]]. This states that  nonclassical/noncommutative as the [[logic]]/[[geometry]] of quantum mechnics may be, it is to be probed and detected by classical/commutative logic/geometry. In _Bohrification_ this heuristics is formalized by the [[semilattice of commutative subalgebras]] and various entities induced by this [[posite]]. The internal [[locale]] $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ may be thought of as an incarnation of the quantum [[phase space]] encoded by $A$.
