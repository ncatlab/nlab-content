## Idea

### Brief

To every [[quantum mechanical system]] is associated its _Bohr topos_ : a [[ringed topos]] which plays the role of the quantum [[phase space]]. The idea of this construction -- _Bohrification_ -- is that it naturally captures the [[geometry|geometric]] and [[logic|logical]] aspects of [[quantum physics]] in terms of [[higher geometry]]/[[topos theory]].

One way to understand Bohrification is as a generalization of the construction of the [[Gelfand spectrum]] of a commutative [[C-star algebra]]s to a context of _noncommutative_ $C^*$-algebras. It assigns to a noncommutative $C^*$-algebra $A$ a generalized [[Gelfand spectrum]] in the form of a [[locale]] $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ [[internalization|internal]] to the [[sheaf topos]] $\mathcal{T}_A$ over the [[poset of commutative subalgebras]] of $A$, or  equivalently its externalization $\Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)$ regarded as a [[locale]] [[over category|over]] the locale of open subalgebras.


### More detailed

The formalization of the notion _[[quantum mechanical system]]_ (see there for details) with its _[[states]]_ and _[[observables]]_ is the following.

* The system as such is encoded by a [[C-star algebra]] $A$;

* a [[self-adjoint operator]] $a \in A$ is thought of as being an [[observable]] of the system: a kind of observation that one can make about it;

* a $\mathbb{C}$-[[linear map]] $\rho : A \to \mathbb{C}$ (which is "positive" and "normalized") is thought of as being a _[[state]]_ that the system can be in -- a physical configuration (or rather: a [[probability distribution]] of such);

* the pairing $(a, \rho) \mapsto \rho(a) \in \mathbb{C}$ is thought of as being the value of the observable $a$ made on the system in state $\rho$: for instance the total _[[energy]]_ of the system as measured in some chosen [[unit]];

* a one-parameter [[group]] of [[automorphism]]s $\mathbb{R} \to Aut(A)$ ([[inner automorphisms]] for "localized" systems, see below) is thought of as as being an _evolution_ of the system, for instance in [[time]] or more general in [[spacetime]].

(Often in the literature quantum mechanical systems are instead dually conceived of in terms of [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] [[spaces of states|spaces of]] [[pure states]]. The relation between these two descriptions is established by the [[GNS-construction]] which allows to pass from one to the other.)

Notice that these axioms are naturally thought of as exhibiting the $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ as a [[Isbell duality|formal dual]] of the would-be _quantum [[phase space]]_ of the physical system -- not quite an ordinary [[topological space]] (which by [[Gelfand duality]] it would be if $A$ were commutative) but still a kind of generalized space. Traditionally it is common to regard this as a space in [[noncommutative geometry]]. Notice that if we do so -- hence if we regard the object $Spec A \in C^\ast Alg^{op}$ that is the incarnation of $A \in C^\ast Alg$ in the [[opposite category]] -- then the definition of [[observable]] above reduces to the evident notion of real-valued functions on quantum phase space: such as function is a [[morphism]] $Spec A \to \mathbb{R}$ in $C^\ast Alg^{op}$, which dually is a $C^\ast$-algebra [[homomorphism]] $C(\mathbb{R})_0 \to A$ (where on the left we have the [[unitization]] of functions with [[compact support]]). That such correspond to [[self-adjoint operator]]s of $A$ is the statement of [[functional calculus]] for $C^\ast$-algebras.

More subtle is the interpretation of the axiom for [[state]]s. Historically this had been been subject to some discussion: by the [[spectral theorem]] two different [[observable]]s $a_1, a_2 \in A$ have a compatible set of observable values if and only if these elements commute with each other in $A$. Generally, a set $\{a_i\}_i$ of observables has a jointly consistent set of observable values if and only if the sub-$C^\ast$-algebra $\langle \{a_i\}_i\rangle \subset A$ generated by them is commutative. Therefore for the phenomenological interpretation of the axioms it seems to make no sense to demand that a [[state]] $\rho : A \to \mathbb{C}$ be linear on non-commuting observables: if $a_1$ and $a_2$ do not commute, it is not a-priori clear that it makes sense to require that $\rho(a_1 + a_2) = \rho(a_1) + \rho(a_2)$. This might experimentally fail, and hold only for commuting $a_1, a_2$.

Therefore the notion of _[[quasi-state]]_ was introduced: a quasi-state on $A$ is defined to be a (positive and normalized) [[function]] $\rho : A \to \mathbb{C}$ which is required to be $\mathbb{C}$-[[linear function|linear]] only on all commutative subalgebras of $A$. Operationally, quasi-states should be the genuine states!

One would therefore tend to think that the terminology has been chosen in an unfortunate way. While maybe true, it turns out -- non-trivially -- that in a major class of cases of interest the distinction does not matter: namely _[[Gleason's theorem]]_ states that for $H$ a separable complex [[Hilbert space]] with $dim H \gt 2$ and $A = B(H)$ the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[bounded operators]] on $\H$, all quasi-states on $A$ are automatically states: a function that is linear on all commutative subalgebras is automatically also linear on all of $A$.

While this means that the distinction between states and quasi-states disappears in a major case of interest, it does not disappear in all cases of interest. In particular, other foundational theorems about quantum mechanics concern the collection of commutative subalgebras, too.

Notably, one may wonder about the evident strengthening of the notion of quasi-states to that of a map $\rho : A \to \mathbb{C}$ which is not just linear but also an [[associative algebra|algebra]] [[homomorphism]] on each commuting subalgebra. Notice that by [[Gelfand duality]] every commutative $C^\ast$-algebra $C$ is the algebra of continuous functions on some [[topological space]} $sp(C)$. Under this duality a [[state]] on $C$ is a [[probability distribution]] on $sp(C)$, while an algebra homomorphism $C \to \mathbb{C}$ is a [[point]] of $X_C$. Therefore a quasi-state which is commutative-subalgebra-wise even an algebra [[homomorphism]] may be thought of as encoding a collection of precise numerical values (as opposed to just expectation values) of _all_ possible observables. Such a hypothetical quasi-state is sometimes called a collection of _[[hidden variables]]_ of the [[quantum mechanical system]]: it's existence would mean that despite the apparent probabilistic nature of [[quantum mechanics]], there are "hidden" non-probabilistic states. But there are not. This is the statement of the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]]: under precisely the assumptions that make [[Gleason's theorem]] work, there is _no_ quasi-state which is commutative-subalgebra-wise an algebra homomorphism.

In summary, this means:

+-- {: .standout}

The foundational characteristics of [[quantum physics]] are encoded in notions of [[function]]s on the [[algebra of observables]] $A$ which are _[[homomorphisms]]_ only _commutative-subalgebra-wise_ .

=--

Since the notion of **commutative-subalgebra-wise homomorphism** is at the heart of quantum physics, it seems worthwhile to consider natural formalizations of this notion. There is indeed a very natural and [[category theory|general abstract]] one: whenever any notion of [[function]] is defined only _locally_ it is natural to consider the [[sheaf]] of such functions over all possible local patches. 

The historically motivating example, and possibly still the most widely familiar one, is that of [[holomorphic function]]s on a [[complex manifold]]: there are in general very few holomorphic functions defined over all of a complex manifold, but plenty of them defined over any small enough subset. And it is of fundamental interest to consider the collections of holomorphic functions over each such subset, and how these restrict to each other under restriction of subsets. This collection of local data is a [[sheaf]] of functions on the complex manifold.

There is an evident analog setup of this situation that applies in the present case of interest, that of functions defined on commutative subalgebras:

for $A$ any [[C-star algebra]], write $\mathcal{C}(A)$ for the set of all its commutative $C^\ast$-subalgebras. This is naturally a [[poset]] under inclusion of subalgebras. A (co)[[presheaf]] of this set is a [[functor]] $\mathcal{C}(A) \to Set$. Any such functor we may think of as a collection of commutative-subalgebra-wise data on $A$, consistent with restriction of subalgebras. The collection of all such functors -- which we write $[\mathcal{C}(A), Set]$ -- is a [[category]] called a [[presheaf topos]]. 

[[internal logic|Inside]] this [[topos]], all the above discussion of foundations of quantum mechanics finds a natural simple equivalent reformulation:

first of all, the non-commutative $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ naturally induces a _commutative_ [[C-star algebra]] object $\underline{A}$ [[internalization|internal to]] $[\mathcal{C}(A), Set]$: namely the [[copresheaf]] defined by the tautological assignment

$$
  \underline{A} : (C \in \mathcal{C}(A)) \mapsto C
  \,.
$$

In words this means nothing but that the collection of all commutative subalgebras of $A$ may naturally be regarded as a _single_ commutative $C^\ast$-algebra [[internalization|internal to]] the [[topos]] $[\mathcal{C}(A), Set]$.

Below we shall discuss ([here](...)) that in a precise sense this commutative internal $\underline{A}$ captures precisely all the [[kinematics|kinematical]] information encoded in the [[quantum mechanical system]] of $A$ -- everything related to [[states]] and [[observables]] but not information about (time) evolution. So everything we have discussed so far.

The pair of these two ingredients

$$
  Bohr(A) := ([\mathcal{C}(A), Set], \underline{A})
$$  

constitutes what is called a _[[ringed topos]]_ -- a special case of the notion of a [[locally ringed topos]]. This notion is a fundamental notion for generalized [[space]]s in [[higher geometry]]. The most advanced general theory of [[higher geometry]] ([[Structured Spaces|Lurie09]]) is based on modelling spaces as ringed toposes.

We shall call this ringed topos the **Bohr topos** of $A$. 

This terminology is meant to indicate that one may think of this construction as formalizing faithfully and usefully a heuristic that has been emphasized by [[Nils Bohr]] -- one of the founding fathers of [[quantum mechanics]] -- and is known as the _doctrine of classical concepts_ ([Scheibe](#Scheibe)) in [[quantum mechanics]]. This states that  nonclassical/noncommutative as the [[logic]]/[[geometry]] of quantum mechanics may be, it is to be probed and detected by classical/commutative logic/geometry. 

Namely in terms of the Bohr topos we have the following equivalent reformulations of the foundational facts about quantum physics discussed above, now internally in $Bohr(A)$.

+-- {: .standout}

**Consistent quantum mechanical states.** A [[quasi-state]] on $A$ is precisely an ordinary [[classical state]] on $\underline{A}$, [[internalization|internal]] to $Bohr(A)$.

In particular ([[Gleason's theorem]]): if $A = B(H)$ for $dim H \gt 2$ then a [[quantum state]] on the external $A$ is precisely a [[classical state]] on the internal $\underline{A}$.

=--

and 

+-- {: .standout}

**Non-existence of hidden quantum variables.** The [[Gelfand spectrum]] $sp(\underline{A})$ of $\underline{A}$ internal to the Bohr topos has no [[global element|global point]]. ([[Kochen-Specker theorem|Kochen-Specker]]).

=--

These two statements might be taken as suggesting that a quantum mechanical system $A$ is naturally regarded in terms of its Bohr topos $Bohr(A)$ -- somewhat more naturally than as a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$. (The second, in a slightly different setup, was emphasized in [IshamHamiltonButterfield](#ButterfieldHamiltonIsham), which inspired all of the following discussion, the first in [Spitters]()). In fact, thinking of [[ringed topos]]es as generalized [[space]]s in [[higher geometry]], it suggests that the Bohr topos $Bohr(A)$ itself _is_ the _quantum [[phase space]]_ of the quantum mechanical system in question.

To which extent this perspective is genuinely useful is maybe still to be established. For pointers to the literature see the [references](#References) below. Discussion along the above lines may suggest that this perspective is indeed useful, but what is probably still missing is a statement about [[quantum physics]] that can be formulated and proven in terms of Bohr toposes, while being hardly conceivable or at least more unnatural without. It is probably currently not clear if such statements have been found.

One potential such statement has been suggested in ([Nuiten](#Nuiten)) after discussion with [[Bas Spitters|Spitters]]: 

in the formalization of [[quantum field theory]] by the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]s -- called [[AQFT]] -- every quantum field theory is entirely encoded in terms of its [[local net of observables]] over [[spacetime]] $X$. This is a [[copresheaf]] of [[C-star algebra]]s

$$
  A : Op(X) \to C^\ast Alg
$$

which assigns to every [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ of [[spacetime]] the quantum [[subsystem]] $A_U$ of quantum fields supported in that region. By the above, we may consider for each of these quantum systems their associated quantum [[phase space]]s given by the correspondong Bohr toposes $Bohr(A_U)$. This yields a presheaf

$$
  Bohr(A) : Op(X)^{op} \to C^\ast_{com} TopSpace \hookrightarrow C^\ast_{com}Topos
$$

of ringed toposes whose internal ring object has the structure of a commutative $C^\ast$-algebra. With the [[copresheaf]] thus turned into a [[presheaf]] it is natural to ask under which conditions this is a [[sheaf]]: under which conditions this presheaf satisfies [[descent]].

In ([Nuiten](#Nuiten)) the following is observed: if $A$ satisfies what is called the _split property_ (a strong form of the [[time slice axiom]]) then  the Bohr-presheaf of quantum phase spaces satisfies spatial descent by [[local geometric morphism]]s precisely of the original copresheaf of observables $A : Op(X) \to C^\ast Alg$ is indeed _[[local net of observables|local]]_ -- spatially and causally. So this means that a natural property of quantum physics -- spatial and causal locality -- corresponds from the perspective of Bohr toposes to a natural property of presheaves of quantum phase spaces: [[descent]].

One can probably view this as further suggestive evidence that indeed quantum physics is naturally regarded from the point of view of the Bohr topos. But for seeing where this perspective is headed, it seems that more insights along these lines would be useful.




## Outline

The discussion below proceeds in the following steps (following ([Nuiten11](#Nuiten)))

1. [Bohr topos of a quantum mechanics system](#BohrToposOfQMSystem)

   This discusses the Bohr topos incarnation of a [[quantum mechanical system]] -- the topos-theoretic quantum [[phase space]] -- and its [[functor|functoriality]].

1. [Kinematics in a Bohr topos](#KinematicsOnBohrTopos)

   This discusses how the classical [[kinematics]] [[internalization|internal to]] a Bohr topos is the external quantum kinematics of the underlying quantum mechanical system.

1. [(Pre-)Sheaf of Bohr toposes of a quantum field theory](#SheafOfBohrToposesOfQFT)

   This discusses how the [[presheaves]] of Bohr toposes obtained by applying Bohrification to a [[local net of observables]] of a [[quantum field theory]].


## Bohr topos of a quantum mechanical system
 {#BohrToposOfQMSystem}


We discuss the definitions and some basic properties of Bohr toposes: certain [[ringed topos]]es -- in fact [[ringed spaces]] -- associated with any (possibly non-commutative) algebra. We formulate the construction for [[C-star algebra]]s, since this is the standard model for [[quantum mechanical system]]s, but actually much of it does not depend on either the [[topology]] or the [[star-algebra]] structure until we come to the discussion of the [kinematics in a Bohr topos](KinematicsOnBohrTopos) below.

###### Remark

Every element of a $C^*$-algebra is the sum of two normal elements, because

$$
  a = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( a + a^* \right) + \left( a - a^*  \right) \right)

A **partial $C^\ast$-algebra is a [[set]] $A$ equipped with

* elements $0,1 \in A$;

* an [[involution]] $\ast : A \to A$;

* a [[function]] $(-)\cdot (-) : \mathbb{C} \times A \to A$;

* a [[function]] $\Vert-\Vert : A \to \mathbb{R}$;

* (partial) binary operations $+, \times : C \to A$

such that every set $S \subset A$ of elements that are pairwise in $C$ is contained in a set $T \subset A$ whose elements are also pairwise in $C$ and on which the above operations yield the structure of a commutative [[C-star algebra]].

A [[homomorphism]] of partial $C^\ast$-algebra is a function preserving this structure. This defines a [[category]] $PCstar$ of partial $C^\ast$ algebras.

A morphism $f : A \to B$ in $C^* Alg$ is called **commutativity reflecting** if for all $a_1, a_2 \in A$ we have that if $f(a_1)$ commutes with $f(a_2)$ in $B$ then already $a_1$ commutes with $a_2$ in $A$.

Write

for the categories of [[ringed spaces]] and [[ringed toposes]], where the [[internalization|internal]] ring object is equipped with the structure of an internal _commutative_ [[C-star algebra]] and the morphisms respect the $C^*$-algebra structure.

Hence a [[morphism]] $(\mathcal{E}, \underline{A}) \to (\mathcal{F}, \underline{B})$ in $C^\ast_{com} Topos$ is 

1. a [[geometric morphism]] $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{F}$ such that the [[inverse image]] $f^* \underline{B}$ is still an internal $C^\ast$-algebra in $\mathcal{E}$;

1. and a morphism of internal $C^\ast$-algebras

For $A \in C^* Alg$ the **Bohr topos** of $A$ is the $C^\ast$-space/topos

  C^\ast_{com} Top \hookrightarrow C^\ast_{com} Topos

whose underlying [[topological space]] is (that corresponding to) the [Bohr site](#BohrSite), and whose internal $C^\ast$-algebra is the tautological [[copresheaf]]

The general notion of [[morphism]]s between [[topos]]es are [[geometric morphism]]. But those that remember the morphisms of Bohr sites are [[essential geometric morphism]]s. 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Every [[functor]] $f : \mathcal{C}(A) \to \mathcal{C}(B)$ induces an [[essential geometric morphism]]

where $Lan_f$ and $Ran_f$ are left and right [[Kan extension]] along $f$, respectively.

We also write $[f,Set] : [\mathcal{C}(A), Set] \to [\mathcal{C}(B), Set]$ for this. Notice that by the equivalence of [[copresheaves]] on [[posets]] and [[sheaves]] on the corresponding [[Alexandrov locales]] (see there for details) this is equivalently

$$
  Sh (Alex(f))) : Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)) \to Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(B))

The next proposition asserts that all essential geometric morphisms between Bohr toposes arise this way:

###### Proposition

The [[2-functor]]

$$
  [-,Set] : Poset \hookrightarrow Topos_{ess}
$$

is a [[full and faithful 2-functor]].

Analogously, [[essential geometric morphism]]s of the underlying toposes $Bohr(A) \to Bohr(B)$ are precisely those in image under the functor $Sh \circ Alex$ of functors $\mathcal{C}(A) \to \mathcal{C}(B)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion in the section _[In terms of essential geometric morphisms](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cauchy+complete+category#InOrdinaryCatTheoryByEssGeomMorphisms)_ at _[[Cauchy complete category]]_ we have a full and faithful embedding of Cauchy-complete catgeories $[-,Set] : Cat_{Cauchy} \hookrightarrow Topos_{ess}$. But posets are trivially Cauchy, complete, hence this restricts to an embedding $[-,Set] : Poset \hookrightarrow Cat_{Cauchy} \hookrightarrow Topos_{ess}$. 

In terms of Alexandrov topologies: by the discussion of [Alexandrov locales](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/specialization+topology#AlexandrovLocales) (in the entry _[[Alexandrov space]]_) we have that the functor $Alex\colon Poset \to Locale$ takes values precisely on those morphisms of locales whose inverse image has a [[left adjoint]]. The statement then follows using the properties of [[localic reflection]], which says that the [[2-functor]] $Sh : Locale \to Topos$ is a [[full and faithful 2-functor]].

=--

For such essential geometric morphisms to be parts of morphisms in 
$C^\ast Topos$, def. \ref{CStarTopos} we need that their [[inverse image]]s 
respect internal $C^\ast$-algebras:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $f : Bohr(A) \to Bohr(B)$ an essential geometric morphism, 
the [[inverse image]] $f^\ast \underline{B}$ is naturally a $C^\ast$-algebra in $[\mathcal{C}(A), Set]$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

According to ([HLS09, 4.8](#HLSDeep)) every functor $\mathcal{C}(A) \to C^\ast Alg$ is an $C^\ast$-algebra [[internalization|internal to]] $[\mathcal{C}(A), Set]$. Here $f^* \underline{B}$ is such a functor, sending $(C \in \mathcal{C}(A)) \mapsto im_f(C)$.

This is ([Nuiten, lemma 2.7](#Nuiten)). (Essentially this argument also appears as ([vdBergHeunen, prop. 33](#vdBergHeunen)), where however the extra right adjoint is not made use of and instead the variances of the morphisms involved in the definition of $C^\ast Topos$ are redefined in order to make the statement come out.)

  \mathcal{C}(A)
   \stackrel{\overset{R_f}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\mathcal{C}(f)}{\to}}
  \mathcal{C}(B)
$$

we assign the [[essential geometric morphism]]

   \stackrel{\overset{f_! := Lan_{R_f}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^* := (-)\circ R_f}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{f_* := (-)\circ \mathcal{C}(f)}{\to}}{\underset{f^! := Ran_{\mathcal{C}(f)}}{\leftarrow}}}}

(wher $Lan$ and $Ran$ denote left and right [[Kan extension]], respectively) equipped with the morphism of internal $C^*$-algebras

$$
  \eta_f : \underline{A} \to f_* \underline{B}
$$

which over $C \in \mathcal{C}(A)$ is the restriction of $f$ to $C$ and [[corestriction]] to $\mathcal{C}(f)(C)$

$$
  f|_C : C \to \mathcal{C}(f)(C)
$$

(to the $C^\ast$-completion of the algebraic image of $f|_C$).

Using prop. \ref{EssentialGeomMorphismsAndPosetMorphisms} the above prop. \ref{BohrFunctoriality} has the following partial converse.

+-- {: .num_prop #ToposCharacterizationOfAlgebraHomomorphisms}
###### Proposition

For $A, B \in C^\ast Alg$,  morphisms $f : Bohr(B) \to Bohr(A)$ in $C^\ast Top$ for which 

1. the underlying geometric morphism has an extra right adjoint 

1. the morphism of internal algebras $\underline{A} \to f_* \underline{B}$ is an [[epimorphism]]

are in bijection with [[function]]s

$$
  f : A \to B
$$

that are [[homomorphism]]s on all commutative subalgebras and reflect commutativity.

In particular when $A$ is already commutative, morphisms $Bohr(B) \to Bohr(A)$ with an extra right adjoint and epi ring homomorphism are in bijection with algebra homomorphisms $A \to B$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop \ref{EssentialGeomMorphismsAndPosetMorphisms} every [[essential geometric morphism]] $Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)) \to Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(B))$ comes from a morphism of locales $Alex \mathcal{C}A \to Alex \mathcal{C}A$, which by the discussion at [[Alexandrov space]] is equivalently a morphism of posets $\mathcal{C}(f) : \mathcal{C}(A) \to \mathcal{C}(B)$. By the assumption of the extra right adjoint we also have a geometric morphism the other way round, and hence, again by prop. \ref{EssentialGeomMorphismsAndPosetMorphisms}, an [[adjoint pair]]

$$
  (\mathcal{C}(f) \dashv R_f) : \mathcal{C}(A) \leftrightarrow \mathcal{C}(B)
$$

that induces functors between toposes as in prop. \ref{BohrFunctoriality}.
Then the fact that $f$ is a morphisms of $C^\ast$-toposes implies 
algebra homomorphisms

$$
  f_C : C \to f(C)
$$

[[natural transformation|natural]] in $C \in \mathcal{C}(A)$.

By the assumption that this are the components of an [[epimorphism]] 
of [[copresheaves]] all these component morphisms are themselves epimorphisms and hence we have that indeed $f(C) = image_{f_C}(C)$.

## Kinematics in a Bohr topos
 {#KinematicsOnBohrTopos}


A key aspect about the Bohr topos $Bohr(A)$ is that that _classical_ [[kinematics]] of the commutative _internal_ $C^*$-algebra $\underline{A} \in Bohr(A)$ is the _quantum_ [[kinematics]] of $A$. In fact, the very definition of $Bohr(A)$ provides a formal context in which [[Gleason's theorem]] has a natural formulation:

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem 
**(GLeason's theorem)**

For $H$ a [[Hilbert space]] of [[dimension]] $dim H \gt 2$, and $A = B(H) \in C^\ast Alg$ its algebra of [[bounded operators]], a [[state]] on $A$ is a [[function]]

$$
  \rho : A \to \mathbb{C}
$$

which is a $\mathbb{C}$-[[linear map]] when restricted to each commutative subalgebra $C \subset A$.

=--

A function that preserves certain [[structure]] locally -- here: over each commutative subalgebra -- is precisely an [[internalization|internal]] fully structure preserving [[homomorphism]] in the [[presheaf topos]] over these local objects -- here: over commutative subalgebras. Hence we have the following direct topos-theoretic equivalent reformulation of Gleason's theorem.

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

For $A = B(H) \in C^\ast Alg$ as above, we have a natural bijection between the quantum [[state]]s on $A$ and the  (classical) states of $\underline{A}$ [[internalization|internal to]] $Bohr(H)$.

=--


### The phase space
 {#ThePhaseSpace}

The idea is is that for $A \in C^* Alg$, the Bohr topos 
$Bohr(A) = (Sh(Alex(\mathcal{C}(A))), \underline{A}) \in C^* TopSpace \subset C^* Topos$ _is_ the corresponding quantum [[phase space]].  More precisely, we may think of the internal commutative $C^*$-algebra $\underline{A} \in Bohr(A)$ as the [[Isbell duality|formal dual]] to the quantum phase space.

The following discussion makes this precise by exhibiting this formal dual as an [[internal locale]]. Since $Bohr(A)$ is a spatial topos, this internal locale is in fact an ordinary [[topological space]] [[bundle]] $\Sigma \to Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$ over the [[Alexandrov space]] $Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$.

+-- {: .num_defn #TheInternalLocale}
###### Definition


Write $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ and $\Sigma_A^{\not \not}$, respectively for the corresponding [[internal locale]]s associated to $\underline{A}$ by internal [[constructive Gelfand duality]]. Write 

$$
  \Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)
$$ 

and

$$
  \Sigma^{\not \not}_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)
$$ 

for the corresponding external locale, given under the [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Loc(Sh(\mathcal{C}(A))) \simeq Loc/\mathcal{C}(A)
$$

###### Definition

For $A$ a (noncommutative) [[C-star algebra]], the assignment

$$
  A \mapsto \Sigma_{A}
$$

$$
  A \mapsto \Sigma^{\not \not}_{A}
$$

is called the **Bohrification** of $A$.

###### Proposition

Let $\underline{\Sigma}(\underline(A))$ be the [[internal locale]] from def. \ref{TheInternalLocale}.

Regarded as an object 

$$
  (\Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A))
  \in
  Loc/\mathcal{C}(A)
$$ 

of external locales over $\mathcal{C}(A)$, this is the [[topological space]] whose underlying set is given by the disjoint union

$$
  \Sigma_A = \coprod_{C \in \mathcal{C}(A)} \Sigma(C)
$$

over all commutative $C^*$-subalgebras of $A$ of the ordinary [[Gelfand spectrum|Gelfand spectra]] $\Sigma(C)$ of these commutative $C^*$-algebras, and whose [[open subset]]s are defined to be those $\mathcal{U} \subset \Sigma_A$ for which

1. $\mathcal{U}|_C \in \mathcal{O}(\Sigma(C))$ for all commutative subalgebras $C$;

1. For all $C \hookrightarrow D$, if $\lambda \in \mathcal{U}|_C$ and $\lambda' \in \Sigma(D)$ such that   $\lambda'|_C = \lambda$, then $\lambda' \in \mathcal{U}|_D$.

Regarded equivalently as an [[internal locale]] in $Sh(\mathcal{C}(A))$ this  

As a [[presheaf]] on the poset $\mathcal{C}(A)$ this is given by

$$
  \underline{\Sigma}(\underline{A})
  :
  U \mapsto \Sigma_U
  \,,
$$

where for $U \in \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{C}(A))$ we set

$$
  \Sigma_U := \coprod_{C \in U} \Sigma(C)
$$

with the relative topology inherited from $\Sigma_A$.

This appears as ([HLSW, theorem 1](#HLSW)).

For $A$ a commutative $C^\ast$-algebra and $\Sigma_A^{Gelf} \in $ [[Loc]] its ordinary [[Gelfand spectrum]], we have that Bohrification in the double negation topology reproduces this ordinary Gelfand spectrum:

$$
  \Sigma^{\not \not}_A \simeq \Sigma_A^{Gel}

Then the construction of the [[ringed topos]] over the [[poset of commutative subalgebras]]

$$
  A \mapsto ([\mathcal{C}(A), Set], \underline{A})
$$

extends to a functor

$$
  C^* Alg_{incl} \to C^*TopSpace \hookrightarrow C^* Topos

$$


where on the right the morphisms of internal rings are even morphisms of internal [[C-star algebra]]s.

With the components of the morphism of internal rings the evident objectwise inclusions, this is directly checked.

+-- {: .num_prop #BohrificationFunctorToLoc}
###### Proposition

Let $Cstar_{inc}$ be the [[category]] of [[C-star algebra]]s and inclusions. Then [Bohrification](#Bohrification) extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \Sigma_{(-)} : CStar_{inc}^{op} \to Loc
  \,.
$$

=--

This is effectively the functoriality of the internal [[constructive Gelfand duality]] applied to the [above observation](#FunctorToRingedToposes). The statement appears as ([vdBergHeunen, theorem 35](#vdBergHeunen)). 


### The observables
 {#TheObservables}

For $A \in C^\ast Alg$ we call a [[self-adjoint operator]] $a \in A$ an quantum [[observable]]. The following statement asserts that quantum observables on $A$ are in a precise sense the $\mathbb{R}$-valued "functions" on the Bohr topos of $A$.

Write $C(\mathbb{R})$ for the $C^\ast$-algebra of continuous complex functions on the [[real line]]. We think of $Bohr(C(\mathbb{R}))$ as the incarnation of $\mathbb{R}$ in the context of Bohr toposes.


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Morphisms $f : Bohr(A) \to Bohr(C(\mathbb{R})_0)$ with an extra right adjoint and $C(\mathbb{R})_0 \to f_*\underline{A}$ epi are in bijection to the observables on $A$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ToposCharacterizationOfAlgebraHomomorphisms}
such morphisms are in bijection to algebra homomorphisms

$$
  C(\mathbb{R})_0 \to A
  \,.
$$

By [[functional calculus]]: every [[self-adjoint operator]] $a \in A$ provides such a homomorphism by $f \mapsto f(a)$. Conversely, given such an algebra homomorphism, its image of $i : x \mapsto x$ is a self-adjoint operator in $A$, and these two constructions are clearly inverses of each other.

=--

Let $x_{t_1} \in A$ be an observable and write $\langle x_{t_1} \rangle$ for the subalgebra generated by it. Then (by general properties of [presheaf over-toposes](#http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/over-topos#PresheafOverTopos)) the [[over topos]] $Bohr(A)/\langle x_{t_1}\rangle$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to

$$
  Bohr(A)/\langle x_{t_1}\rangle
  \simeq
  [\langle x_{t_1}\rangle \mathcal{C}(A), Set]
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[copresheaves]] over the [[under-category]] $\langle x_{t_1}\rangle /\mathcal{C}(A)$. This is precisely the sub-[[poset of commutative subalgebras]] on those commutative subalgebras that contain $x_{t}$. This means that a classically consistent observation in the slice topos is one that is consistent with the observation of $x_{t_1}$.

(...)
### The states


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $A \in C^\ast Alg$ write 
$(Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)), \mathbb{R})$ for the [[ringed topos]] as indicated, where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the copresheaf constant on $\mathbb{R}$.

The internal $C^\ast$-algebra $\underline{A} \in Bohr(A)$ is an internal $\mathbb{R}$-module. Forgetting the algebra structure and only remembering the $\mathbb{R}$-module structure, we get a category of "$\mathbb{R}$-module toposes".

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Observation

There is a canonical morphism of ringed toposes

$$
  \pi : Bohr(A) \to (Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)), \mathbb{R})
$$

whose underlying geometric morphism is the identity (and whose morphism of internal ring objects is the unique).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This [[bundle]] is the $C^\ast$-topos incarnation of the morphism $\Sigma \to Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$ of locales discussed [above](ThePhaseSpace).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Observation

A [[state]] $\rho$ on $A$ is a [[section]] of $\pi$ in the category
of $\mathbb{R}$-moduled toposes that is positive and normalized.

## (Pre-)Sheaf of Bohr toposes of a quantum field theory
 {#SheafOfBohrToposesOfQFT}


Notice that in the context of [[AQFT]] a [[quantum field theory]] is encoded by a [[local net]] of [[C-star algebra]]s on [[spacetime]].

+-- {: .num_note #PresheavesFromLocalNets}
###### Note

Let $X$ be a [[Lorentzian manifold]] and 

$$
  A : \mathcal{O}(X) \to C^* Alg_{inc}
$$

be a [[local net]] of algebras. Notice that by definition this indeed takes values in $C^\ast$-algebras and _inclusions_ . Then postcomposition with the [Bohr topos](#BohrTopos)-functor yields a presheaf of ringed spaces

$$
  Bohr(A) : \mathcal{O}(X)^{op} 
    \to 
  C^* Alg_{inc}^{op}
   \hookrightarrow 
  C^* Alg_{cr}^{op}
   \stackrel{Bohr}{\to}
  C^* TopSpace
   \hookrightarrow
  C^* Topos
  \,.
$$

This appears as ([Nuiten, def. 17](#Nuiten)).

### Locality and descent

Assume that a net of observables $A : Op(X) \to C^\ast Alg_{inc}$
satisfies the [[split property]]. Then it is [[local net|local]] precisely if the corresponding presheaf of Bohr toposes
$Bohr(A) : Op(X)^{op} \stackrel{A}{\to} C^\ast Alg_{inc} \stackrel{Bohr}{\to} C^\ast Top$ satisfies _spatial_ [[descent]] by [[local geometric morphism]]s (meaning that for every spatial hyperslice $\Sigma \subset X$ the induced presheaf $Bohr(A)|_\Sigma : Op(\Sigma)^{op} \to C^\ast Top$ satisfies [[descent]] by [[local geometric morphism]]s.)

(...)

This appears as ([Nuiten, theorem 4.2](#Nuiten)).
