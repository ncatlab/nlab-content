## Idea

To every [[quantum mechanical system]] is associated its _Bohr topos_ : a [[ringed topos]] which plays the role of the quantum [[phase space]]. The idea of this construction -- _Bohrification_ -- is that it naturally captures the [[geometry|geometric]] and [[logic|logical]] aspects of [[quantum physics]] in terms of [[higher geometry]]/[[topos theory]].

One way to understand Bohrification is as a generalization of the construction of the [[Gelfand spectrum]] of a commutative [[C-star algebra]]s to a context of _noncommutative_ $C^*$-algebras. It assigns to a noncommutative $C^*$-algebra $A$ a generalized [[Gelfand spectrum]] in the form of a [[locale]] $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ [[internalization|internal]] to the [[sheaf topos]] $\mathcal{T}_A$ over the [[semilattice of commutative subalgebras]] of $A$, or  equivalently its externalization $\Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)$ regarded as a [[locale]] [[over category|over]] the locale of open subalgebras.

When applied to subalgebras of [[bounded operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] this construction has been suggested to formalize faithfully and usefully a heuristic that has goes back to [[Nils Bohr]] and is known as the _doctrine of classical concepts_ ([Scheibe](#Scheibe)) in [[quantum mechanics]]. This states that  nonclassical/noncommutative as the [[logic]]/[[geometry]] of quantum mechanics may be, it is to be probed and detected by classical/commutative logic/geometry. In _Bohrification_ this heuristics is formalized by the [[semilattice of commutative subalgebras]] and various entities induced by this [[posite]]. The internal [[locale]] $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ may be thought of as an incarnation of the quantum [[phase space]] encoded by $A$.

One thing that is nice about [[Bohrification]] is that it makes the following statement true: "[[quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[states]] on a quantum algebra $A$ are precisely [[classical mechanics|classical]] states [[internalization|internal]] to the Bohrified ringed topos corresponding to $A$".

This is essentially a direct re-interpretation of [[Gleason's theorem]]: this theorem says that quantum states on $A$ are already fixed by demanding them to be maps on $A$ that are (positive, normed) linear functions on all commutative subalgebras of $A$. Now, the immediate formalization of a map $A \to \mathbb{C}$ that is required to preserve certain structure on all commutative subalgebras is a fully structure-preserving function, but _internal_ to the [[presheaf topos]] over the comutative subalgebras. That presheaf topos is the "Bohrification" of $A$.

## Outline

The discussion below proceeds in the following steps (following ([Nuiten11](#Nuiten)))

1. [Bohr topos of a quantum mechanics system](#BohrToposOfQMSystem)

   This discusses the Bohr topos incarnation of a [[quantum mechanical system]] -- the topos-theoretic quantum [[phase space]] -- and its [[functor]]iality.

1. [Kinematics in a Bohr topos](#KinematicsOnBohrTopos)

   This discusses how the classical [[kinematics]] [[internalization|internal to]] a Bohr topos is the external quantum kinematics of the underlying quantum mechanical system.

1. [(Pre-)Sheaf of Bohr toposes of a quantum field theory](#SheafOfBohrToposesOfQFT)

   This discusses how the [[presheaves]] of Bohr toposes obtained by applying Bohrification to a [[local net of observables]] of a [[quantum field theory]].


## Bohr topos of a quantum mechanical system
 {#BohrToposOfQMSystem}


We discuss the definitions and some basic properties of Bohr toposes: certain [[ringed topos]]es -- in fact [[ringed spaces]] -- associated with any (possibly non-commutative) algebra. We formulate the construction for [[C-star algebra]]s, since this is the standard model for [[quantum mechanical system]]s, but actually much of it does not depend on either the [[topology]] or the [[star-algebra]] structure until we come to the discussion of the [kinematics in a Bohr topos](KinematicsOnBohrTopos) below.

### $C^*$-algebras

###### Definition

A [[C-star algebra]] is (...)

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $A$ a [[star-algebra]], an element $a \in A$ is called a **[[normal operator|normal element]]** if $a^* a = a a^*$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Every element of a $C^*$-algebra is the sum of two normal elements, because

$$
  a = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( a + a^* \right) + \left( a - a^*  \right) \right)
  \,.
$$

This means whenever a linear morphism between the vector spaces underlying two  $C^*$-algebras is defined on normal elements, it is already defined on all elements. This will be used in several of the arguments below.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #PartialCStar}
###### Definition

A **partial $C^\ast$-algebra is a [[set]] $A$ equipped with

* a symmetric and reflexive binary [[relation]] $C \subset A \times A$;

* elements $0,1 \in A$;

* an [[involution]] $\ast : A \to A$;

* a [[function]] $(-)\cdot (-) : \mathbb{C} \times A \to A$;

* a [[function]] $\Vert-\Vert : A \to \mathbb{R}$;

* (partial) binary operations $+, \times : C \to A$

such that every set $S \subset A$ of elements that are pairwise in $C$ is contained in a set $T \subset A$ whose elements are also pairwise in $C$ and on which the above operations yield the structure of a commutative [[C-star algebra]].

A [[homomorphism]] of partial $C^\ast$-algebra is a function preserving this structure. This defines a [[category]] $PCstar$ of partial $C^\ast$ algebras.

=--

This appears as ([vdBergHeunen, def. 11,12](#vdBergHeunen)).


+-- {: .num_defn #PartialAlgebraOfNormalOperators}
###### Definition

For $A$ a [[C-star algebra]], write 

$$
  N(A) := \{a \in A | a a^* = a^* a\}
$$

for its set of [[normal operator]]s. This is naturally a [partial C-star algebra](#PartialCStar) with $C \subset N(A) \times N(A)$ the set of pairs of elements that commute in $A$.

### The Bohr site
 {#BohrSite}

+-- {: .num_defn #PosetOfCommutativeSubalgebras}
###### Definition

For $A$ a [partial C-star algebra](#PartialCStar) write $\mathcal{C}(A)$ for the [[poset]] of total (not partial) commutative sub [[C-star algebra]]s. We call this the [[poset of commutative subalgebras]].

This extends to a functor

$$
  \mathcal{C} : C^* Alg \to Poset
  \,.
$$

to the [[category]] [[Poset]] of [[posets]].

=--

Notice the following fact about [[Alexandrov space]]s:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The functor

$$
  Alex : Poset \to Top
$$

from [[posets]] to [[topological spaces]] that sends a poset $P$ to the topological space whose underlying set is the underlying set of $P$ and whose [[open subsets]] are the upward closed subsets $Up(P)$ exhibits an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$

of [[Poset]] with the [[full sub-category]] of [[Alexandrov space]]s.

=--

###### Definition

For $A \in C^* Alg$ we call $Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$ the **Bohr [[site]]** of $A$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A morphism $f : A \to B$ in $C^* Alg$ is called **commutativity reflecting** if for all $a_1, a_2 \in A$ we have that if $f(a_1)$ commutes with $f(a_2)$ in $B$ then already $a_1$ commutes with $a_2$ in $A$.

Write

$$
  C^* Alg_{cr} \subset C^* Alg
$$

for the [[subcategory]] of [[C-star algebra]]s on the commutativity-reflecting morphisms.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Every [[monomorphism]] $A \hookrightarrow B$ in $C^* Alg$ is commutativity reflecting.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A morphism $f : A \to B$ in $C^* Alg$ is commutativity reflecting precisely if the morphism $Alex \mathcal{C} (f) : Alex \mathcal{C}(A) \to Alex \mathcal{C}(B)$  in $AlexandrovTop$ has a [[left adjoint]]

$$
  Alex \mathcal{C}(A)
   \stackrel{L_f}{\underset{Alex \mathcal{C}(f)}{\to}}
  Alex \mathcal{C}(B)
  \,.
$$

This appears as ([Nuiten, lemma 2.6](#Nuiten)).

###### Definition

Write 

$$
  C^* Alg_{inc}

for the subcategories of $C^* Alg$ on the monomorphisms and on the commutativity-reflecting morphisms, respectively.

### The Bohr topos
 {#BohrTopos}

Above we considered to each $C^*$-algebra $A$ its [Bohr site](BohrSite) $Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$. There are canonical embeddings ([[full and faithful functor]])s

$$
  Top \hookrightarrow Locale \stackrel{Sh}{\hookrightarrow} Topos
$$

first of [[Top]] into [[Locale]] and then into [[Topos]].



+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Write

$$
  C^*_{com} Top \hookrightarrow C^*_{com} Topos
$$

for the categories of [[ringed spaces]] and [[ringed toposes]], where the [[internalization|internal]] ring object is equipped with the structure of an internal _commutative_ [[C-star algebra]] and the morphisms respect the $C^*$-algebra structure.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #TheSheafTopos}
###### Definition

For $A \in C^* Alg$ the **Bohr topos** of $A$ is the $C^\ast$-space/topos

$$
  Bohr(A) := ( Sh(Alex(\mathcal{C}(A))), \underline{A}) \in
  C^\ast_{com} Top \hookrightarrow C^\ast_{com} Topos
$$

whose underlying [[topological space]] is (that corresponding to) the [Bohr site](#BohrSite), and whose internal $C^\ast$-algebra is the tautological [[copresheaf]]

$$
  \underline{A} : (C \in \mathcal{C}(A)) \mapsto C
$$

in $[\mathcal{C}(A), Set] \simeq Sh(Alex(\mathcal{C}(A)))$.


Moreover, write

$$
  Bohr_{\not \not}(A)
  :=
  (Sh_{\not \not}(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)), \underline{A})
$$

for the $C^*$-topos whose underlying [[sheaf topos]] is that for the [[double negation topology]] on the plain Bohr topos.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

This construction extends to a [[functor]] of the form

$$
  Bohr 
  : 
  C^\ast Alg_{cr}^{op} 
    \to 
  C^\ast_{com} TopSpace 
    \hookrightarrow 
  C^\ast_{com} Topos
$$

that takes values in [[essential geometric morphisms]]. 

=--

This is ([Nuiten, lemma 2.7](#Nuiten)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To $f : A \to B$ in $C^\ast Alg_{cr}$ with

$$
  ( \mathcal{C}(f) \dashv R_f) : 
  \mathcal{C}(A)
   \stackrel{\overset{R_f}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\mathcal{C}(f)}{\to}}
  \mathcal{C}(B)
$$

we assign the [[essential geometric morphism]]

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_* )
  :=
  [\mathcal{C}(B), Set]
   \stackrel{\overset{f_! := Lan_{R_f}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^* := (-)\circ R_f}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_* := (-)\circ \mathcal{C}(f)}{\to}}}
  [\mathcal{C}(A), Set]
$$

equipped with the evident morphism of internal $C^*$-algebras

$$
  \eta_f : \underline{A} \to f_* \underline{B}
$$

which over $C \in \mathcal{C}(A)$ is the restriction

$$
  f|_C : C \to f(C)
$$

of $f$ to $C$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ToposCharacterizationOfAlgebraHomomorphisms}
###### Proposition

For $A, B \in C^\ast Alg$,  morphisms $f : Bohr(B) \to Bohr(A)$ in $C^\ast Top$ for which 

1. the underlying geometric morphism has an extra right adjoint 

1. the morphism of internal rings $\underline{B} \to f_* \underline{A}$ is an [[epimorphism]]

are in bijection with [[function]]s

$$
  f : A \to B
$$

that are [[homomorphism]]s on all commutative subalgebras and reflect commutativity.

In particular when $A$ is already commutative, morphisms $Bohr(B) \to Bohr(A)$ with an extra right adjoint are in bijection with algebra homomorphisms $A \to B$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[localic reflection]] every [[geometric morphism]] $Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)) \to Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(B))$ comes from a morphism of locales $Alex \mathcal{C}A \to Alex \mathcal{C}A$, which by the discussion at [[Alexandrov space]] is equivalently a morphism of posets $\mathcal{C}(f) : \mathcal{C}(A) \to \mathcal{C}(B)$. By the assumption of the extra right adjoint we also have a geometric morphism the other way round, and hence by localic reflection an adjoint pair

$$
  (\mathcal{C}(f) \dashv R_f) : \mathcal{C}(A) \leftrightarrow \mathcal{C}(B)
$$

that induces functors between toposes as in the above proof.
Then the fact $f$ is a morphisms of $C^\ast$-toposes implies 
algebra homomorphisms

$$
  f_C : C \to f(C)
$$

natural in $C \in \mathcal{C}(A)$.

By the assumption that this is epi we have that indeed $f(C) = image_{f_C}(C)$.

## Kinematics in a Bohr topos
 {#KinematicsOnBohrTopos}


A key aspect about the Bohr topos $Bohr(A)$ is that that _classical_ [[kinematics]] of the commutative _internal_ $C^*$-algebra $\underline{A} \in Bohr(A)$ is the _quantum_ [[kinematics]] of $A$. In fact, the very definition of $Bohr(A)$ provides a formal context in which [[Gleason's theorem]] has a natural formulation:

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem 
**(GLeason's theorem)**

For $H$ a [[Hilbert space]] of [[dimension]] $dim H \gt 2$, and $A = B(H) \in C^\ast Alg$ its algebra of [[bounded operators]], a [[state]] on $A$ is a [[function]]

$$
  \rho : A \to \mathbb{C}
$$

which is a $\mathbb{C}$-[[linear map]] when restricted to each commutative subalgebra $C \subset A$.

=--

A function that preserves certain [[structure]] locally -- here: over each commutative subalgebra -- is precisely an [[internalization|internal]] fully structure preserving [[homomorphism]] in the [[presheaf topos]] over these local objects -- here: over commutative subalgebras. Hence we have the following direct topos-theoretic equivalent reformulation of Gleason's theorem.

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

For $A = B(H) \in C^\ast Alg$ as above, we have a natural bijection between the quantum [[state]]s on $A$ and the  (classical) states of $\underline{A}$ [[internalization|internal to]] $Bohr(H)$.

=--


### The phase space
 {#ThePhaseSpace}

The idea is is that for $A \in C^* Alg$, the Bohr topos 
$Bohr(A) = (Sh(Alex(\mathcal{C}(A))), \underline{A}) \in C^* TopSpace \subset C^* Topos$ _is_ the corresponding quantum [[phase space]].  More precisely, we may think of the internal commutative $C^*$-algebra $\underline{A} \in Bohr(A)$ as the [[Isbell duality|formal dual]] to the quantum phase space.

The following discussion makes this precise by exhibiting this formal dual as an [[internal locale]]. Since $Bohr(A)$ is a spatial topos, this internal locale is in fact an ordinary [[topological space]] [[bundle]] $\Sigma \to Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$ over the [[Alexandrov space]] $Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$.

+-- {: .num_defn #TheInternalLocale}
###### Definition


Write $\underline{\Sigma}_A$ and $\Sigma_A^{\not \not}$, respectively for the corresponding [[internal locale]]s associated to $\underline{A}$ by internal [[constructive Gelfand duality]]. Write 

$$
  \Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)
$$ 

and

$$
  \Sigma^{\not \not}_A \to \mathcal{C}(A)
$$ 

for the corresponding external locale, given under the [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Loc(Sh(\mathcal{C}(A))) \simeq Loc/\mathcal{C}(A)
$$

discussed at [[internal locale]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Bohrification}
###### Definition

For $A$ a (noncommutative) [[C-star algebra]], the assignment

$$
  A \mapsto \Sigma_{A}
$$

or 

$$
  A \mapsto \Sigma^{\not \not}_{A}
$$

is called the **Bohrification** of $A$.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #TheInternalLocale}
###### Proposition

Let $\underline{\Sigma}(\underline(A))$ be the [[internal locale]] from def. \ref{TheInternalLocale}.

Regarded as an object 

$$
  (\Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A))
  \in
  Loc/\mathcal{C}(A)
$$ 

of external locales over $\mathcal{C}(A)$, this is the [[topological space]] whose underlying set is given by the disjoint union

$$
  \Sigma_A = \coprod_{C \in \mathcal{C}(A)} \Sigma(C)
$$

over all commutative $C^*$-subalgebras of $A$ of the ordinary [[Gelfand spectrum|Gelfand spectra]] $\Sigma(C)$ of these commutative $C^*$-algebras, and whose [[open subset]]s are defined to be those $\mathcal{U} \subset \Sigma_A$ for which

1. $\mathcal{U}|_C \in \mathcal{O}(\Sigma(C))$ for all commutative subalgebras $C$;

1. For all $C \hookrightarrow D$, if $\lambda \in \mathcal{U}|_C$ and $\lambda' \in \Sigma(D)$ such that   $\lambda'|_C = \lambda$, then $\lambda' \in \mathcal{U}|_D$.

Regarded equivalently as an [[internal locale]] in $Sh(\mathcal{C}(A))$ this  

As a [[presheaf]] on the poset $\mathcal{C}(A)$ this is given by

$$
  \underline{\Sigma}(\underline{A})
  :
  U \mapsto \Sigma_U
  \,,
$$

where for $U \in \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{C}(A))$ we set

$$
  \Sigma_U := \coprod_{C \in U} \Sigma(C)
$$

with the relative topology inherited from $\Sigma_A$.


=--

This appears as ([HLSW, theorem 1](#HLSW)).


+-- {: .num_prop #BohrificationDependsOnNormalElementsOnly}
###### Proposition

The Bohrification of $A \in ncCStar$ only depends on its [partial C-star algebra](#PartialCStar) $N(A)$ of normal elements

  \Sigma_A \simeq \Sigma_{N(A)}
  \,.
$$

This is highlighted in ([vdBergHeunen](#vdBergHeunen)).

For $A$ a commutative $C^\ast$-algebra and $\Sigma_A^{Gelf} \in $ [[Loc]] its ordinary [[Gelfand spectrum]], we have that Bohrification in the double negation topology reproduces this ordinary Gelfand spectrum:

$$
  \Sigma^{\not \not}_A \simeq \Sigma_A^{Gel}

extends to a functor

$$
  C^* Alg_{incl} \to C^*TopSpace \hookrigharrow C^* Topos

where on the right the morphisms of internal rings are even morphisms of internal [[C-star algebra]]s.

With the components of the morphism of internal rings the evident objectwise inclusions, this is directly checked.

Let $Cstar_{inc}$ be the [[category]] of [[C-star algebra]]s and inclusions. Then [Bohrification](#Bohrification) extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \Sigma_{(-)} : CStar_{inc}^{op} \to Loc
  \,.
$$

=--

This is effectively the functoriality of the internal [[constructive Gelfand duality]] applied to the [above observation](#FunctorToRingedToposes). The statement appears as ([vdBergHeunen, theorem 35](#vdBergHeunen)). 


### The observables
 {#TheObservables}

For $A \in C^\ast Alg$ we call a [[self-adjoint operator]] $a \in A$ an quantum [[observable]]. The following statement asserts that quantum observables on $A$ are in a precise sense the $\mathbb{R}$-valued "functions" on the Bohr topos of $A$.

Write $C(\mathbb{R})$ for the $C^\ast$-algebra of continuous complex functions on the [[real line]]. We think of $Bohr(C(\mathbb{R}))$ as the incarnation of $\mathbb{R}$ in the context of Bohr toposes.


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Morphisms $f : Bohr(A) \to Bohr(C(\mathbb{R}))$ with an extra right adjoint and $C(\mathbb{R}) \to f_*\underline{A}$ epi are in bijection to the observables on $A$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ToposCharacterizationOfAlgebraHomomorphisms}
such morphisms are in bijection to algebra homomorphisms

$$
  C(\mathbb{R}) \to A
  \,.
$$

By [[functional calculus]]: every [[self-adjoint operator]] $a \in A$ provides such a homomorphism by $f \mapsto f(a)$. Conversely, given such an algebra homomorphism, its image of $i : x \mapsto x$ is a self-adjoint operator in $A$, and these two constructions are clearly inverses of each other.

=--

### The states


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $A \in C^\ast Alg$ write 
$(Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)), \mathbb{R})$ for the [[ringed topos]] as indicated, where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the copresheaf constant on $\mathbb{R}$.

The internal $C^\ast$-algebra $\underline{A} \in Bohr(A)$ is an internal $\mathbb{R}$-module. Forgetting the algebra structure and only remembering the $\mathbb{R}$-module structure, we get a category of "$\mathbb{R}$-moduld toposes".

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Observation

There is a canonical morphism of ringed toposes

$$
  \pi : Bohr(A) \to (Sh(Alex \mathcal{C}(A)), \mathbb{R})
$$

whose underlying geometric morphism is the identity (and whose morphism of internal ring objects is the unique).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This [[bundle]] is the $C^\ast$-topos incarnation of the morphism $\Sigma \to Alex \mathcal{C}(A)$ of locales discussed [above](ThePhaseSpace).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Observation

A [[state]] $\rho$ on $A$ is a [[section]] of $\pi$ in the category
of $\mathbb{R}$-moduled toposes that is positive and normalized.

## (Pre-)Sheaf of Bohr toposes of a quantum field theory

Notice that in the context of [[AQFT]] a [[quantum field theory]] is encoded by a [[local net]] of [[C-star algebra]]s on [[spacetime]].

Let $X$ be a [[Lorentzian manifold]] and 

$$
  A : \mathcal{O}(X) \to C^* Alg_{inc}
$$

be a [[local net]] of algebras. Notice that by definition this indeed takes values in $C^\ast$-algebras and _inclusions_ . Then postcomposition with the [Bohr topos](#BohrTopos)-functor yields a presheaf of ringed spaces

$$
  Bohr(A) : \mathcal{O}(X)^{op}
