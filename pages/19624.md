## Idea

In [[perturbative string theory]], the _string length scale_ $\ell_s$ is a [[unit]] of [[length]] which sets the [[scale]] for the extension of [[strings]] described by [[sigma-model]] [[worldsheet]] [[field theories]]. Specifically, the [[Nambu-Goto action]] for the string is nothing but the relativistic [[volume]]-[[functional]], and the string length determines in which [[units]] the volume is measured.

The [[square]] of the string length is known as the _Regge slope_ and traditionally denoted by $\alpha^\prime$:

$$
  \alpha^\prime \;=\; \ell_s^2
  \,.
$$

The inverse of the string length squared/Regge slope is called the _string tension_, traditionally denoted

$$
  T_s \;=\; \frac{1}{2\pi \alpha^\prime} = \frac{1}{2 \pi \ell_s^2}
  \,.
$$

This way the [[Nambu-Goto action]] for the string with proper [[units]] attached is 

$$
  L_{NG} \;=\; T vol_{\Sigma}
  \,,
$$

where $vol_{\Sigma}$ is the (induced) [[volume form]] on the [[worldsheet]] $\Sigma$.




## Properties

### Relation to Planck length and string coupling

For discussion of relation to [[Planck length]] and [[string coupling constant]] see at [[non-perturbative effect]] the section _[Worldsheet and brane instantons](non-perturbative+effect#WorldsheetAndBraneInstantons)_

### Vanishing tension limit

In the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] $T_s \to 0$, $\ell_s \to \infty$ of vanishing string tension, [[string field theory]] is supposed to become Vasiliev's [[higher spin gauge theory]]. See there for more.
