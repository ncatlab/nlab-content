###### Definition

For $k$ some [[field]], write $LieAg_k$ for the [[category]] of [[Lie algebras]] over $k$, and write 

$$
  ((LieAlg)_k)^{\Delta^{op}}
  \in sSetCat
$$ 

for the category of [[simplicial objects]] in that category, naturally regarded as a [[simplicial category]]. Say a morphism in that category is a _weak equivalence_ or _fibration_, if its underlying morphism of [[simplicial sets]] is a weak equivalence or fibration, respectively, in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]]. Write $((LieAlg)_k)^{\Delta^{op}}_{proj}$ for the category equipped with these classes of morphism.

###### Proposition

The category $((LieAlg)_k)^{\Delta^{op}}_{proj}$ from def. \ref{CategoryOfSimplicialLieAlgebras} is a [[simplicial model category]].

Since [[Lie algebras]] are algebras over a [[Lawvere theory]], this is a special case of ([Reedy 74, theorem I](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+simplicial+algebras#Reedy74)) discussed at _[[model structure on simplicial algebras]]_. Without the simplicial enrichment and on [[reduced simplicial sets|reduced]] simplicial Lie algebras this model structure is left as an exercise for the reader in ([Quillen 69, below theorem 4.7](#Quillen69)).
