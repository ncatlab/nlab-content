## Idea

The __quaternions__ form the largest [[associative algebra|associative]] [[normed division algebra]], usually denoted  $\mathbb{H}$ after [[William Rowan Hamilton]] (since $\mathbb{Q}$ is taken for the [[rational numbers]]). 

## Properties

### Normed division algebra structure

The structure of $\mathbb{H}$ as an $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]] is given by a basis $\{1, i, j, k\}$ of the underlying [[vector space]] of $\mathbb{H}$, equipped with a multiplication table where $1$ is the [[identity element]] and otherwise uniquely specified by the equations 

$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = i j k = -1,$$ 

and extended by $\mathbb{R}$-linearity to all of $\mathbb{H}$. The norm on $\mathbb{H}$ is given by 

$${\|\alpha\|}^2 = \alpha \widebar{\alpha}$$ 

where given an $\mathbb{R}$-[[linear combination]] $\alpha = a 1 + b i + c j + d k$, we define the _conjugate_ $\widebar{\alpha} \coloneqq a 1 - b i - c j - d k$. A simple calculation yields 

$${\|\alpha\|}^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$$ 

whence for $\alpha \neq 0$, the multiplicative [[inverse]] is 

$$\alpha^{-1} = \frac1{{\|\alpha\|}^2} \widebar{\alpha}.$$ 

In this way $\mathbb{H}$ is a normed division algebra. 

### Modules and bimodules

We have canonical left and right [[module]] structures on $\mathbb{H}^n$, but as $\mathbb{H}$ is not commutative, if we want to talk about tensor products of modules, we need to consider [[bimodules]]. This also means that ordinary [[linear algebra]] as is used over a field is not quite the same when dealing with quaternions. For instance, one needs to distinguish between _left_ and _right_ [[eigenvalues]] of [[matrices]] in $M_n(\mathbb{H})$ (using the left and right module structures on $\mathbb{H}^n$ respectively), and only left eigenvalues relate to the [[spectrum]] of the associated linear operator.

Using the conjugation operation one can define an inner product $\langle q,p\rangle := \overline{q} p$ on $\mathbb{H}^n$ so that the corresponding [[orthogonal group of an inner product space|orthogonal group]] is the [[compact symplectic group]].

### Automorphisms

The [[automorphism group]] of the quaternions is [[special orthogonal group|SO(3)]], [[action|acting]] canonically  on their imaginary part (in generalization of how the product of [[complex numbers]] respects the [[complex conjugation]] action)
