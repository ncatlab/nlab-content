## Idea

In traditional mathematics and [[set theory]], the [[category]] [[Set]] of all [[sets]] is the archetypical [[topos]]. However, in [[predicative mathematics]] with its notion of sets, these do not form a topos since they do not satisfy the [[powerset axiom]]. In [[constructive mathematics]], we may be *weakly* predicative and *almost* form a topos; the resulting weaker structure which [[Bishop sets]] (for example) form is a  _predicative topos_ ([van den Berg](#vdBerg)).  

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **predicative topos** is a [[ΠW-pretopos]] satisfying the [[axiom of multiple choice]].

=--

This is ([van den Berg, def. 6.1](#vdBerg)).


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The [[axiom of multiple choice]] appears in different strengths in the literature. Accordingly there is the notion of strong/weak predicative topos if it satisfies the strong/weak version of this axiom

## Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

A [[category]] of [[internal sheaves]] over an [[internal site]] in a predicative topos is again a predicative topos.

=--

This is ([van den Berg, therem 7.5](#vdBerg)), using [vdBerg-Moerdijk, theorem 4.21](#vdBergMoerdijk)


## Examples

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

The [[category]] of [[Bishop sets]] in [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]] is a [strong predicative topos.

=--

This is ([van den Berg, theorem 6.2](#vdBerg)), based on ([Moerdijk-Palmgren 99, section 7](#MoerdijkPalmgren99)) and ([Moerdijk-Palmgren 00, section 10](#MoerdijkPalmgren00)).
