## Idea

In traditional mathematics and [[set theory]], the [[category]] [[Set]] of all [[sets]] is the archetypical [[topos]]. However, in [[predicative mathematics]] with its notion of sets, these do not form a topos since they do not satisfy the [[powerset axiom]]. In [[constructive mathematics]], we may be *weakly* predicative and *almost* form a topos; the resulting weaker structure which [[Bishop sets]] (for example) form is a  _predicative topos_ ([van den Berg](#vdBerg)).
