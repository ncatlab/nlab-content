## Idea

In traditional mathematics and [[set theory]], the [[category]] [[Set]] of all [[sets]] is the archetypical [[topos]]. However, in [[constructive mathematics]] with its notion of sets -- [[Bishop sets]] -- these do not quite form a topos since they do not satisfy the [[powerset]] [[axiom]] (see at _[[predicative mathematics]]_). The resulting weaker structure which they form is a  _predicative topos_ ([van den Berg](#vdBerg)).
