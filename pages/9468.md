## Idea

Integral calculus is one of the two halves of the [[infinitesimal number|infinitesimal]] [[calculus]], the other being [[differential calculus]]. (The two are linked by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].)

Integral calculus describes [[integration]] of sufficiently well-behaved [[functions]].
