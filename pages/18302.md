## Definition

For $X$ a suitable [[space]] of sorts, the _category of vector bundles over $X$_ is the [[category]] denoted $Vect(X)$  whose

1. [[objects]] are [[vector bundles]] over $X$,

1. [[morphisms]] are vector bundle [[homomorphisms]] over $X$.

Specifically for $X$ a [[topological space]], there is the category of [[topological vector bundles]] over $X$. 

Via [[direct sum of vector bundles]] and [[tensor product of vector bundles]] this becomes a [[symmetric monoidal category]] in two compatible ways, making it a [[distributive monoidal category]], in particular a [[rig category]].

For $X$ a [[compact Hausdorff space]] then the [[Grothendieck group]] of $Vect(X)$ is the [[topological K-theory]] group $K(X)$.

## Relation to other catgeories

### Vector spaces

For $X = \ast$ the [[point space]], then this is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the category [[Vect]] of plain vector spaces:

$$
  Vect(\ast) \simeq Vect
  \,.
$$


### Higher vector bundles

An analog in [[homotopy theory]]/[[higher categegory theory]] is the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[(infinity,1)-module bundles]].
