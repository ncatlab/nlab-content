## Idea

A _polarization_ on an [[algebraic variety]] is a choice of [[line bundle]] on it whose [[Chern class]] is analogous to the class represented by a [[Kähler form]] in [[complex analytic geometry]].

In other words, the concept of polarized algebraic variety is the generalization of that of _[[Kähler polarization]]_ from [[symplectic geometry]]/[[complex geometry]] to more general [[algebraic geometry]]. In fact it is the generalization of the concept of a [[holomorphic line bundle|holomorphic]] [[prequantum line bundle]] compatible with a [[Kähler polarization]]. 

(Notice however the reversion of the logic: in [[symplectic geometry]] the symplectic form is given and then a [[complex structure]] is chosen to match it, whereas here in [[algebraic geometry]] the analog of the complex structure exists beforehand, given by the algebraic structure, and now a polarization conversely asks for the analog of a compatible symplectic form (and for its [[prequantization]])).

Therefore a polarized variety together with a choice of [[Theta characteristic]] on it is the algebraic geometry version of a polarized [[phase space]] with [[metaplectic correction]]. See at _[[geometric quantization]]_ for more on this.

## Definition

A _polarization_ of an [[algebraic variety]] $X$ over an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$ is a choice of [[ample sheaf|ample]] element in its [[Néron-Severi group]] $Pic_X/Pic_X^0$. In other words, a polarization is the choice of an [[equivalence class]] of an [[ample sheaf|ample]] alegbraic [[line bundle]] over $X$ (e.g. [[holomorphic line bundles]] if $k$ is the [[complex numbers]]) where two such are regarded as equivalent if they differ by tensoring with one whose underlying topological [[Chern class]] is trivial.

The polarization is called _principal_ if it is of [[degree of a coherent sheaf|degree]] 1.

## Examples

### Jacobians

The [[Jacobian variety]] of an algebraic variety is principally polarized by the [[theta divisor]].
