## Idea

What are called _half-spin groups_ or _semi-spin groups_ ([McInnes 99a](#McInnes99a), [McInnes 99b](#McInnes99b)) are [[quotient groups]] of [[spin groups]] $Spin(n)$ by a _non-standard_ [[Z/2]]-[[subgroup]]:

Generally, every [[spin group]] $Spin(n)$ is, essentially by definition, a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[group extension]] of the corresponding [[special orthogonal group]], so that the [[quotient group]] by the resulting canonical [[subgroup]] inclusion $\mathbb{Z}/2 \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} Spin(n)$ recovers [[SO(n)]]

$$
  Spin(n)/_{\iota}(\mathbb{Z}/2) \simeq SO(n)
  \,.
$$

But in the special case that the [[dimension]] $n = 4k$ is a [[positive number|positive]] multiple of 4 distinct from 8 (i.e. $k \in \mathbb{N}_{\gt 0}$, k \neq 2), there is _another_ $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[conjugacy class of subgroups]] $\mathbb{Z}/2 \overset{\iota_{s}}{\hookrightarrow} Spin(4k)$, which is distinct from the canonical $\iota$, and hence yields a [[quotient group]]

$$
  SemiSpin\big(4k \big)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  Spin\big(4k\big)/_{\iota_s} (\mathbb{Z}/2)
$$ 

which is distinct from (i.e. not [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to) [[SO(n)]].

This is called the _semi-spin group_ or _half-spin_ group in that dimension.

## Examples

### SemiSpin(4)

The semi-spin group in [[dimension]] 4 is just the [[direct product group]] of [[SU(2)]] with [[SO(3)]]:

$$
  SemiSpin(4)
  \;\simeq\;
  SU(2) \times SO(3)
$$


### SemiSpin(8)
 {#SemiSpin8}

While also for [[Spin(8)]] it is the case that the [[center]] contains two copies of [[Z/2]], $Z\big( Spin(8)\big) \simeq  \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, in this case the existence of [[triality]] [[automorphisms]] actually makes these two copies behave identically, so that here the would-be semi-spin groups happens to coincide with [[SO(8)]] after all:

$$
  Spin(8)/_{\iota_s} \mathbb{Z}_2
  \;\simeq\;
  SO(8)
  \;\simeq\;  
  Spin(8)/_{\iota} \mathbb{Z}_2
$$

(e.g. [McInnes 99a, p. 9](#McInnes99a))

### SemiSpin(16)

The [[subgroup]] of the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[E8]] which corresponds to the [[Lie algebra]]-inclusion $\mathfrak{so}(16) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{e}_8$ is the [[semi-spin group]] [[SemiSpin(16)]]:

$$
  SemiSpin(16)
  \;\subset\;
  E_8
$$

On the other hand, the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(16)$ is _not_ a [[subgroup]] of $E_8$ (e.g. [McInnes 99a, p. 11](#McInnes99a)).

In [[heterotic string theory]] with [[gauge group]] the [[direct product group]] $E_8 \times E_8$ it is typically this [[subgroup]] $Semispin(16) \times SemiSpin(16)$ which is considered (but typically denoted $Spin(16)/\mathbb{Z}_2$, see also [Distler-Sharpe 10, Sec. 1](parameterized+WZW+model#DistlerSharpe10)).

### SemiSpin(32)

In [[heterotic string theory]] precisely two ([[isomorphism classes]] of) [[gauge groups]] are consistent (give [[quantum anomaly cancellation]]): one is the [[direct product group]] $E_8 \times E_8$ of the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[E8]] with itself, the other is in fact the [[semi-spin group]] [[SemiSpin(32)]] (see [McInnes 99a, p. 5](#McInnes99a)). 

Beware  that the [[string theory]] literature often writes this as $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is at best ambiguous and misleading, or even as $SO(32)$, which is wrong. Of course this follows the general tradition in the [[physics]] literature to write identifications of [[Lie groups]] that are really only identifications of their [[Lie algebras]], see also ["SO(10)-GUT theory"](GUT#TheGUTKnownAsSO10).
