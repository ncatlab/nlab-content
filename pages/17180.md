## Idea

A [[model category]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] for an [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[n-excisive functors]]. 

For $n = 1$ this is a model structure on [[excisive functors]], hence (for the case of functors from finite pointed homotopy types to pointed homotopy types, see [here](excisive+%28∞%2C1%29-functor#SpectrumObjects)) a [[model structure for spectra]] ([Lydakis 98, theorem 11.3](#Lydakis98)). 

## Examples

### Symmetric monoidal model category for spectra
 {#ModelStructureForSpectra}

The model structure for 1-excisive functors (from pointed finite homotopy types to pointed homotopy types) is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]] [[model structure for spectra|for spectra]] ([Lydakis 98, theorem 11.3](#Lydakis98)).

The [[excisive functors]] naturally carry a [[smash product]] ([Lydakis 98, def.5.1](#Lydakis98)) making the model structure for 1-excisive functors a [[symmetric monoidal model category]] ([Lydakis 98, section 12](#Lydakis98)), hence a [[symmetric smash product on spectra]]. This is different in style to that on the "highly structured" cases of [[symmetric spectra]], [[orthogonal spectra]] and [[S-modules]], instead it is the structure that had earlier been introduced as "FSP" ("functors with smash product") in ([Bökstedt 86](#Bökstedt86)).
