* [[Georg Hegel]],

  _Encyclopedia of the philosophical Sciences_

  1817

which gives a relatively brief survey of _Hegel's system_ 

1. starting in the first part (widely known as _The Shorter Logic_) with a summary of the _[[Science of Logic]]_ ([[ontology]], [[metaphysics]]);

1. proceeding in the second part with a _Philosophy of Nature_ ([[physics]]);

1. and ending in the third part with a _Philosophy of the Spirit_ which in turn 

   1. contains a summary of the _[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]_ (in its first section, B) 

   1. and overlaps with (the preface of) the [[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]] (second section, C)

   1. and with the [[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]] (third section, b and c).

Hegel defines these three parts in the Introduction (§ 18) as:

   1. Logic: the science of the Idea in and for itself.

   1. The Philosophy of Nature: the science of the Idea in its otherness.

   1. The Philosophy of Mind: the science of the Idea come back to itself out of that otherness.
