Hodge numbers are the dimensions of certain cohomology spaces for a compact complex manifold. More precisely,
$$
h^{p,q}(X)=dim_\mathbb{C}H^q(X;\Omega^p),
$$
where $\Omega^p$ is the sheaf of holomorphic $p$-forms on $X$. If $dim_\mathbb{C}(X)=n$, then $h^{p,q}(X)=h^{n-p,n-q}(X)$; in particular, $h^{n,n}(X)=1$.

When $X$ is a [[KÃ¤hler manifold]], then Hodge numbers have a number of additional nontrivial properties: 

* they are symmetric, i.e., $h^{p,q}(X)=h^{q,p}(X)$;

* $h^{p,p}\geq 1$ for any $p=1,\dots,n$; 

* $b_k(X)=\sum_{p+q=k}h^{p,q}(X)$, where $b_k$ is the $k$-th [[Betti number]] of $X$.
