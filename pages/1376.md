## Idea

Recall that a [[monoid]] object or algebra object in a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is the same as a lax monoidal functor

$$
  * \to C
  \,.
$$

This definition generalized to [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal (∞,1)-categories]] and defines algebra objects for these.


## Definition

For $C$ a [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with monoidal structure determined by the [[(∞,1)-functor]] 

$$
  p_\otimes : C^\otimes \to N(\Delta)^{op}
$$

a **monoid object** of $C$ is a [[lax monoidal (infinity,1)-functor|lax monoidal (∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  N(\Delta)^{op} \to C^\otimes
$$

## Examples

* An algebra object in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] is an [[A-infinity ring|A-∞ ring]]. If it is a commutative monoid, it is an [[E-infinity ring|E-∞ ring]].
