## Idea

The _graviton_ is the (hypothetical) quantum of the [[field (physics)|field]] of [[gravity]], i.e., the quanta of the theory of [quantum gravity](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+gravity).

## Details

In [[first-order formulation of gravity]] a field configuration is locally a [[Lie algebra-valued form]]

$$
  (E, \Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d)
$$

with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]].

This is a [[vielbein]] $E$ and a [[spin connection]] $\Omega$. This together is the **graviton field**.

A graviton has [spin](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spin) $2$, and is massless. We can see that it has spin $2$ from the fact that the source of gravity is $T$, the [energy-momentum tensor](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stress-energy+tensor), which is a second-rank tensor. It can be shown that a massless spin-$2$ particle has to be a graviton. The basic concept behind this is that massless particles have to couple to conserved currents - the stress-energy tensor $T$, the source of gravity.

In [[supergravity]] this is accompanied by the [[gravitino]].
