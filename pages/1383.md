## Idea

An ordinary (commutative) [[ring]] is a (commutative) [[monoid]] or [[algebra]] object [[internalization|internal to]] the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[Ab]] of abelian groups.

The role that [[Ab]] plays among ordinary [[category|categories]] is played by the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] $Sp$ among [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].

A _commutative ring spectrum_, or _[[E-infinity ring]]_, is accordingly a [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category]].




## Definition

A **commutative ring spectrum** is a [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|commutative algebra object]] in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra|of spectra]].
