## Idea

An _h-cobordism_ is a [[cobordism]] such that the two boundary inclusions$\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2 \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ are [[homotopy equivalences]].

## Properties

### h-Cobordism theorem

The _[[h-cobordism theorem]]_ gives sufficient conditions for an h-cobordism to be equivalent to a [[cylinder]].
