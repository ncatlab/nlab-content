## Idea

The _stable homotopy category_ $Ho(Spectra)$ is the [[category]] of [[spectra]] and [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms between them, the object of study in classical [[stable homotopy theory]]. Equivalently this is the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]] of the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] and the latter is the proper context for [[stable homotopy theory]]. But with due care exercised, the stable homotopy category itself is useful.

The stable homotopy category may be thought of as the [[stabilization]] of the classical [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$ under the operation of forming [[loop space objects]] $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspensions]] $\Sigma$: via forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty$ every [[pointed object]] in the classical [[homotopy category]] maps to the stable homotopy category, and under this map the [[loop space]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-[[functors]] become inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the stable homotopy category.

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/} 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,.
$$


In contrast to the classical [[homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.

Equipped with the [[smash product of spectra]] "$\wedge$" and with [[function spectra]] $[-,-]$, the stable homotopy category becomes a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]]. 

A ([[commutative monoid|commutative]]) [[monoid object]] with respect to $\wedge$ is ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectrum]].

For $E \in Ho(Spectra)$ any spectrum, then the [[functor]]

$$
  E_\bullet \coloneqq \pi_0((\Sigma^\bullet E) \wedge(-)) \;\colon\; Ho(Spectra) \longrightarrow Ab
$$ 

is a [[generalized homology theory]], while the functor

$$
  E^\bullet \coloneqq \pi_0[-,\Sigma^\bullet E] \;\colon\; Ho(Spectra)^\op \longrightarrow Ab
$$

is a [[generalized cohomology theory]].


## Definition

There are various different-looking ways to define the stable homotopy category.

### Via eventually defined maps

One of the first constructions of the stable homotopy category is due to ([Adams 74, part III, sections 2 and 3](#Adams74)). This _[[Adams category]]_ is defined to be the category of [[CW-spectra]] with [[homotopy classes]] of "eventually defined" functions between them.

### Via left homotopy of spectra

Let $PreSpectra \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\ell}{\longleftarrow}} Spectra$ be the 1-categorical [[adjunction]] between spectra and prespectra, in the sense defined at [[coordinate-free spectrum]], where $\ell$ is the forgetful functor. For $E$ a spectrum and $X$ a [[pointed topological space]], write

$$
  E \wedge X \coloneqq L(\ell E \wedge X)
$$

for the spectrification of the degreewise [[smash product]] of [[pointed objects]]. Write $I_+$ for the unit [[interval]] with a base point adjoined, such that for any spectrum $E$, the spectrified [[smash product]] $E \wedge I_+$ is its _[[cylinder spectrum]]_.

A _[[left homotopy]]_ between maps of spectra $f,g \colon E_1 \longrightarrow E_2$ is a morphism of spectra

$$
  \phi \colon E_1\wedge I_+ \longrightarrow E_2
$$

such that $\phi|_0 = f$ and $\phi|_1 = g$.

Write $[E_1,E_2]$ for the corresponding [[homotopy classes]] of maps. The _stable homotopy category_ is equivalently the category of [[CW-spectra]] with these homotopy classes of maps between them.

([Elmendorf-Kriz-May, p. 8](#ElmendorfKrizMay))

Restricted to [[suspension spectra]] this is equivalently the [[colimit]] over all [[reduced suspensions]] of [[homotopy classes]] of topological spaces:

$$
  [\Sigma^\infty X_1, \Sigma^\infty X_2]
    \simeq
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n} [\Sigma^n X, \Sigma^n Y]
  \,.
$$ 

For the analogous construction in [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] -- yielding the [[equivariant stable homotopy category]] --. see ([Greenlees-May 95, section 2](#GreenleesMay95))


## Properties

### Symmetric monoidal structure

The [[smash product of spectra]] makes the stable homotopy category into a [[symmetric monoidal category]].

An ([[commutative monoid|commutative]]) [[monoid object]] with respect to this is a ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectrum]]. A [[module object]] over such is a [[module spectrum]].

### Triangulated structure

The [[homotopy fiber sequenes]] of spectra gives the stable homotopy category the structure of a [[triangulated category]].
