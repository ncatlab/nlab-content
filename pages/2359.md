## Idea

The _stable homotopy category_ $Ho(Spectra)$ is the [[category]] of [[spectra]] and [[homotopy classes]] of morphisms between them, the object of study in classical [[stable homotopy theory]]. Equivalently this is the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]] of the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] and the latter is the proper context for [[stable homotopy theory]]. But with due care exercised, the stable homotopy category itself is useful.

The stable homotopy category may be thought of as the [[stabilization]] of the classical [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$ under the operation of forming [[loop space objects]] $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspensions]] $\Sigma$: via forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty$ every [[pointed object]] in the classical [[homotopy category]] maps to the stable homotopy category, and under this map the [[loop space]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-[[functors]] become inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the stable homotopy category.

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/} 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,.
$$


In contrast to the classical [[homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.

Equipped with the [[smash product of spectra]] "$\wedge$" and with [[function spectra]] $[-,-]$, the stable homotopy category becomes a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]]. 

A ([[commutative monoid|commutative]]) [[monoid object]] with respect to $\wedge$ is ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectrum]].

For $E \in Ho(Spectra)$ any spectrum, then the [[functor]]

$$
  E_\bullet \coloneqq \pi_0((\Sigma^\bullet E) \wedge(-)) \;\colon\; Ho(Spectra) \longrightarrow Ab
$$ 

is a [[generalized homology theory]], while the functor

$$
  E^\bullet \coloneqq \pi_0[-,\Sigma^\bullet E] \;\colon\; Ho(Spectra)^\op \longrightarrow Ab
$$

is a [[generalized cohomology theory]].


## Definition

There are various different-looking ways to define the stable homotopy category.

### Via eventually defined maps

One of the first constructions of the stable homotopy category is due to ([Adams 74, part III, sections 2 and 3](#Adams74)), following ([Boardman 65](#Boardman65)). This _[[Adams category]]_ is defined to be the category of [[CW-spectra]] with [[homotopy classes]] of "eventually defined" functions between them.

Hostorically this was advertized as being a construction free of tools of [[category theory]]. See ([Lewis-May-Steinberger 86, pages 1-3](#LewismaySteinberger86)) for review and critical assessment

### Via left homotopy
 {#ViaSpectrificationofSequentialPreSpectra}

([Lewis-May-Steinberger 86, "preamble" pages 1-7](#LewisMaySteinberger86), [Elmendorf-Kriz-May 95, p. 8](#ElmendorfKrizMay95), [Malkiewich 14](#Malkiewich14))

For $E$ a [[sequential spectrum|sequential]] [[pre-spectrum]] and $X$ a [[pointed topological space]], write

$$
  (E \wedge X)_n \coloneqq E_n \wedge X
$$

for the degreewise [[smash product]] of [[pointed topological spaces]]. Write $I_+$ for the unit [[interval]] with a base point adjoined, such that for any spectrum $E$, the [[smash product]] $E \wedge I_+$ is its _[[cylinder spectrum]]_.

A _[[left homotopy]]_ between morphism of pre-spectra $f,g \colon E_1 \longrightarrow E_2$ is a morphism of spectra

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; E_1\wedge I_+ \longrightarrow E_2
$$

such that $\phi|_0 = f$ and $\phi|_1 = g$.

In order for this to be the homotopy-correct notion, we need to apply it with [[domain]] a [[CW-spectrum]] and [[codomain]] an [[Omega-spectrum]].

Let $PreSpectra \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\ell}{\longleftarrow}} Spectra$ be the 1-categorical [[adjunction]] between [[Omega-spectra]] and [[prespectra]], in the sense defined at [[coordinate-free spectrum]], where $\ell$ is the [[forgetful functor]] and $L$ is [[spectrification]]. 

There is also a [[CW-spectrum]]-replacement functor $\Gamma$.

Write then 

$$
  [E_1,E_2]
  \coloneqq
  Hom(\Gamma E_1, L E_2)_{\sim_{left\;homotopy}}
$$ 

for the corresponding [[homotopy classes]] of maps. 


### Via model structures

There are several [[model categories]] which exhibit [[model structures for spectra]], hence whose [[homotopy category]] is equivalent to the stable homotopy category.

For instance the [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]] of [[sequential spectrum|sequential]] [[pre-spectra]] in [[simplicial sets]] ([Bousfield-Friedlander  78](#BousfieldFriedlander78)).

(...)


## Properties

### Symmetric monoidal structure

The [[smash product of spectra]] makes the stable homotopy category into a [[symmetric monoidal category]].

An ([[commutative monoid|commutative]]) [[monoid object]] with respect to this is a ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectrum]]. A [[module object]] over such is a [[module spectrum]].

### Triangulated structure

The [[homotopy fiber sequences]] of spectra gives the stable homotopy category the structure of a [[triangulated category]].
