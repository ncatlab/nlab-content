# Categorical meaning #

A [[category]] is **discrete** if it is both a [[groupoid]] and a [[preorder]].  That is, every morphism should be invertible, any two [[parallel morphisms]] should be equal.  The idea is that in a discrete category, no two distinct (nonisomorphic) objects are connectable by any path (morphism), and an object connects to itself only through its [[identity morphism]].

Often one also assumes that a discrete category is [[skeletal category|skeletal]]; a category is both discrete and skeletal if and only if it contains only identity morphisms.  However, this definition is [[evil]], because it states that objects (the source and target of the identity morphism in question) are equal; it is cleaner to separate the discreteness from the skeletality.

A ([[small category|small]]) discrete category may be identified with its [[set]] of isomorphism classes.  Conversely, given a [[collection]] $S$ of objects, the __discrete category over $S$__ is the category with $S$ as its collection of objects and only identity morphisms.


# Topological meaning #

If $C$ is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] or [[internal category|internal]] to [[topological space|topological spaces]], then there is another completely different meaning of **discrete**: that the _topology_ on the arrows (and the objects, in the internal case) is the discrete topology.

This is especially confusing if one extends the use of "discrete category over $S$" to the case of internal categories, when $S$ is an object of some ambient category.  With this usage, if $S$ is a topological space, then the "discrete internal category over $S$" in [[Top]] will not be discrete in the topological sense: it still remembers the topology on that space.
