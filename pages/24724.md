## Idea

A quasiminimal structure is a particular class of [[pregeometries]] (infinite finitary matroids). Quasiminimal excellent classes were defined by Zilber as useful axiomatic setup satisfying [[categoricity]].

In original treatments, among the axioms, excellence was hard/technical to prove. A breakthrough is a result that it is essentially automatic:
