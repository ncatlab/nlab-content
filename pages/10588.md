## Idea

An _elliptic spectrum_ is a [[spectrum]] which [[Brown representability theorem|represents]] an [[elliptic cohomology theory]]. More in detail, an elliptic spectrum is a triple consisting of an [[elliptic curve]] $A$ and an even [[periodic cohomology theory|periodic]] [[ring spectrum]] $E$ and an [[equivalence]]

$$
  Spec \pi_0 E(BU(1)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \widehat A
$$

between the algebraic spectrum of the $E$-[[cohomology ring]] over the [[classifying space]] for [[circle group]] [[principal bundles]] (see at [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]) and the [[formal group]] associated to $A$.
