[[!redirects semitransitive coring]]
Let $k$ be a (commutative) [[field]] and $R$ a $k$-algebra.

An $R$-[[coring]] $C$ is semi-transitive if the category  $M^C_f$ of $C$-comodules which are finitely generated as modules over $R$

* $M^C_f$ is artinian and noetherian (has all objects of finite composition length), all its objects are projective as $R$-modules, and all its hom-spaces are finite dimensional over $k$
* the category of all $C$-comodules is Ind-generated by $M^C_f$ (Every $C$-comodule is a filtered colimit of $C$-comodules finitely generated as $R$-modules)

It appears that semi-transitive corings are those corings which can be reconstructed from fiber functors on categories which are artinian, noetherian and with finite dimensional hom-spaces.
