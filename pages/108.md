#Idea#

Descent is the property satisfied by an [[(infinity,1)-presheaf]] that models an [[infinity-stack]] or [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]]: it in effect simply says that evaluating the stack on any space must yield a result equivalent to evaluating it on an equivalent stack. 


For $C$ some [[site]], we can think of any [[higher category theory|infinity category]] valued (pseudo)[[presheaf]]
$$
  \mathbf{A} : C^{op} \to \inftyCat
$$
as assigning to each space (object of $C$) the $\infty$-category of certain structures living over that space.

* For instance for $C = $ [[Top]] and for $G$ a group, there is the [[category|1-category]]-valued (pseudo)presheaf
$$
  \mathbf{A}(-) := G-TrivBund(-)
$$
which sends each space $X$ to the [[category]] (a one-object [[groupoid]], really) of _trivial_ $G$-principal bundles over $X$.

* Or the [[category|1-category]]-valued 
(pseudo)presheaf
$$
  \mathbf{A}(-) := G-Bund(-)
$$
which assigns to $X$ the category of all $G$-principal bundles over $X$.

In the case that we have a [[cover]] $Y \to X$ of the space $X$, we may want to ask which $\mathbf{A}$-structures on the cover, $a \in \mathbf{A}(Y)$, can _descend_ down to $\mathbf{A}$-structures on $X$. The idea is that these are those $a \in \mathbf{A}(Y)$ which can be _glued_ consistently:

* on double intersections $Y \times_X Y$, there should be a gluing isomorphism $g : \pi_1^* a \to \pi_2^* a$ which identifies the two copies of $a$ obtained by pullback along the two projection maps $\pi_1. \pi_2 : Y \times_X Y \to Y$.

* on triple intersections $Y \times_X Y \times_X Y$ there should be a gluing 2-isomorphism
$
 \array{
   && \pi_2^* a
   \\
   &
   {}^{\pi_{12}^* g}\nearrow
   &\Downarrow^f&
   \searrow^{\pi_{23}^* g}
   \\
   \pi_1^* a
   &&
     \stackrel{\pi_{13}^* g}{\to}
   &&
   \pi_3^* a
 }
$
which identifies the different gluing 1-isomorphisms.

* "and so on".

The collection of objects $a \in \mathbf{A}(Y)$ together with this gluing data should themselves fit into an $\infty$-category. This $\infty$-category is the _$\infty$-category of descent data_ for the (pseudo)presheaf $\mathbf{A}$ relative to the cover $Y \to X$.

* **Codescent:** an analogous situation is obtained for (pseudo)co-presheaves: their gluing information with respect to a cover yields an $\infty$-category of _codescent data_.

* **Hypercovers:** in general the simplicial space
$ \cdots \to Y \times_X Y \times_X Y \to Y \times_X Y \to Y$ can be replaced by any [[hypercover]] $Y^\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}\gt X$ of $X$.


 
##(Co)descent in terms of homotopy (co)limit ##

**In weak $\infty$-categories**

Fundamentally the $\infty$-category of descent data associated to a simplicial hypercover $Y^\bullet$ of $Spaces$ and a (pseudo)presheaf $A : Spaces^\op \to \infty Cat$ should be the [[2-limit|weak limit]] or [[homotopy limit]] 
$$
  Desc(Y^\bullet,\mathbf{A}) := Holim_{[n \in \Delta]} \mathbf{A}(Y^n)
  \,.
$$

Similarly the $\infty$-category of codescent data should be a _weak colimit_ or _homotopy colimit_.
$$
  Codesc(Y^\bullet,\mathbf{A}) := Hocolim_{[n \in \Delta]} \mathbf{A}(Y^n)
  \,.
$$

This can be made precise in various concrete models for [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-categories of (infinity,1)-sheaves]]

* In the context of the Brown-Joyal-Jardine model for [[infinity-stack]]s in terms of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

  * this was worked out in Daniel Dugger, Sharon Hollander, Daniel C. Isaksen, _Hypercovers and simplicial presheaves_ ([web](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0563/)) 

  * details are described at [[descent for simplicial presheaves]]

* In the context of weak $\infty$-categories called [[Segal category|Segal categories]] this can be implemented directly. See

  * Bertran To&euml;en, _Higher and derived stacks: a global overview_ ([page 12](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0604/0604504v3.pdf#page=12))


**In strict $\infty$-categories**

But there is also a way to realize this naturally in the [[semi-strict infinity-category|more strict]] context of 
[[strict omega-category|strict omega categories]] using [[oriental]]s and other cosimplicial strict $\omega$-categories. This was introduced in

* Ross Street, _The algebra of oriented simplices_, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 49 (1987) 283-335; ([pdf](http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/aos.pdf))

and reviewed and expanded on

* Ross Street, _Categorical and combinatorial aspects of descent theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0303175)).

Using language of [[enriched category theory]] Street's construction of the $\omega$-category of descent data is given by the [[end]]

$$
  Desc(Y^\bullet, \mathbf{A}) := 
   \int_{[n]\in \Delta}
   hom(O(\Delta^n), \mathbf{A}(Y^n)) 
  \,.
$$
Here $hom$ is the internal $hom$ in $\omega$-categories, and $O(\Delta^n)$ is the $n$th [[oriental]].

(Dominic Verity kindly provided help in obtaining this coend-reformulation).

In this context the $\omega$-category of codescent data for an $\omega$-category valued co-presheaf $\mathbf{B}$ can be defined as the [[end|coend]]

$$
  Codesc(Y^\bullet, \mathbf{B})
  :=
  \int^{[n] \in \Delta}
  \mathbf{B}(Y^n) \otimes O(\Delta^n) 
  \,.
$$

**Remark.** The above definitions in terms of orientals certainly gives the right answer in the case that $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ take values in $\omega$-groupoids. In this case one can equivalently replace $O(\Delta^n)$ here with $\Pi_\omega(\Delta^n)$, the fundamental $\omega$-groupoid of the filtered standard $n$-simplex, which should be the free $\omega$-groupoid on $\Delta^n$. In terms of more general $\omega$-categorical coefficients it seems that in the above definition orientals need to be replaced with a different cosimplicial $\omega$-category.

For the moment, more details about this [[strict omega-category|strict omega categorical]] notion of descent and codescent is relegated to [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology]].


# Descent in terms of pseudo-functors #

One way to think of the $\infty$-category $Desc(Y^\bullet, \mathbf{A})$ of descent data is as the $\infty$-category of
weak (pseudo) $\infty$-functors from the cover $Y$, regarded as a presheaf itself, to $\mathbf{A}$.

* For $n=1 $ this is formalized by the notion of [[sieve]] and the formulation of the [[sheaf]] condition in terms of [[sieve]]s.

* For $n=2$, where one has the notion of pseudo 2-functors from the context of [[bicategory]], one can understand the triangles appearing above as the images of weak 2-functors from a [[sieve]] to $\mathbf{A}$, as described at [[stack]].

We now show how to continue this pattern in the context of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]]:

A weak $\omega$-functor between strict $\omega$-categories $C$ and $D$ can be modeled as a strict $\omega$-functor out of a cofibrant replacement of $C$, with respect to the [[folk model structure]] on strict $\omega$-categories.

In view of the remark above, let $O : \Delta \to \omega Groupoids$ send $[n]$ to the free strct $n$-groupoid on $n$.  Then for $Y \to X$ a cover such that the corresponding simplicial space $Y^\bullet$ exists, the codescent $\omega$-category

$$
  Codesc(Y) := \int^{[n] \in \Delta} O([n]) \cdot Y^{n}
$$

can be regarded as a replacement for the &Ccaron;ech groupoid of the cover (compare the discussion at [[oriental]]). 

Accordingly strict $\omega$-functors from $Codesc(Y)$ 
(regarded as a represented $\infty$-presheaf) to 
$\mathbf{A}$ should be 

$$
  hom(Codesc(Y), \mathbf{A})
  \,.
$$

Using that the contravariant hom takes colimits to
limits this is  

$$
  \cdots \simeq
  \int_{[n] \in \Delta} hom(O([n])\cdot Y^n, \mathbf{A})
  \,.
$$ 

Then using the hom-adjunctions this becomes
$$

\cdots \simeq \int_{[n] \in \Delta} hom(O([n]), 
 hom(Y^n, \mathbf{A}))
$$ 

and with Yoneda finally

$$\cdots \simeq \int_{[n] \in \Delta} hom(O([n]), \mathbf{A}(Y^n))
 \,.
$$ 

Hence by the above definition of the descent $\omega$-category 

$$
  \cdots \simeq
  Desc(Y, \mathbf{A})
  \,.
$$

Notice, as remarked at the end of [[sieve]] that we
can regard (the $\infty$-presheaf represented by)
$Codesc(Y)$ as a resolution of the [[sieve]]
corresponding to the cover $Y$.


#Cohomology, Homotopy and $\infty$-(Co)Stacks #

From the notion of (co)descent data one obtains the notions of 

* [[nonabelian sheaf cohomology]];

* [[nonabelian cosheaf homotopy]];

* [[infinity-stack|infinity-stacks and -costacks]].



#Examples#

* A description of ordinary $G$-principal bundles in the language of descent $\infty$-categories is in section 5.4 of [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology]].

* The higher homotopy van Kampen theorem is about the _strict_ version of codescent, with the homotopy colimit replaced by an ordinary colimit. This is discussed in [Codescent and the van Kampen theorem](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/10/codescent_and_the_van_kempen_t.html).
