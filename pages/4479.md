## Idea

If a [[subset]] $k$ of a [[field]] $K$ is a [[subalgebra|subfield]], then we call the larger field $K$ an **extension** of the smaller field $k$. 

More generally, if $k \to K$ is *any* [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] between fields, then it must be an [[injection]], so we may treat it as a field extension. 

## Properties

* [[Galois theory]]

* [[class field theory]]

## Factorization system

Every field extension can be factorized as a [[purely transcendental extension]] followed by an [[algebraic extension]]. Indeed, by [[Zorn's lemma]], we may construct a transcendence basis (i.e. maximal algebraically independent set) $B$, and the purely transcendental part is the subfield generated by $B$.

Unfortunately, this does not yield an [[orthogonal factorization system]]: given a field $K$, we may form the field $K (x)$ of [[rational functions]] over $K$, which is a purely transcendental extension of $K$, and we may form the [[algebraic closure]] $\overline{K (x)}$, which is an algebraic extension of $K (x)$; but we have the following commutative diagram,
$$\array{
K & \to & K (x^2) \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
K (x) & \to & \overline{K (x)}
}$$
where $K (x^2)$ is the subfield of $K (x)$ generated by $x^2$, and $K (x^2) \to \overline{K (x)}$ is algebraic, yet there is no homomorphism $K (x) \to K (x^2)$ making both evident triangles commute.
