## Idea

If a [[subset]] $k$ of a [[field]] $K$ is a [[subalgebra|subfield]], then we call the larger field $K$ an **extension** of the smaller field $k$. 

More generally, if $k \to K$ is *any* [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] between fields, then it must be an [[injection]], so we may treat it as a field extension.
