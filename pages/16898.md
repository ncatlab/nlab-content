## Idea and motivations

The notion of pseudo-Banach ring is a generalization of the notion of [[Banach rings]], essentially obtained by replacing the usual triangular inequality $|a+b|\leq |a|+|b|$ by the more natural (in a categorical sense) weak triangular inequality
$|a+b|\leq C\cdot\max(|a|,|b|)$.

Their use allows the definition of an $\mathbb{R}_+^*$-action on various categories of [[global analytic spaces]].

They are also the natural objects that appear as $\pi_0$ of spectral rings in
[[spectral global analytic geometry]].

## Definition

A pseudo-Banach ring is a ring object in the rig category $(\mathbb{R}_{+\leq}^\mathrm{Sets},\oplus_\infty,\otimes_m)$
of $\mathbb{R}_+$-graded sets (with bounded maps between them).
This means a set $R$ with a norm
$|\cdot|_R:R\to \mathbb{R}_+$ such that there exists $C$, $D$ and $E$ with

* $|a+b|\leq C\cdot \max(|a|,|b|)$,

* $|ab|\leq D\cdot|a|\cdot|b|$,

* $|0|=0$,

* $|1|\leq E\cdot 1$ (one often supposes additionally that $|1|=1$).

## Modules and their operations

If $X$ is an $\mathbb{R}_+$-graded set, and $R$ is a pseudo-Banach ring, one may define an associated pseudo-normed free module $R^{(X)}$ by putting on
the usual free module a convenient grading (not given by the usual $\ell^1$ grading). Using this, and the coproduct and product of $\mathbb{R}_+$-graded sets, one defines direct sums and tensor products of modules.

One may also work with the category of ind-pseudo-Banach ring, and of ind-pseudo-Banach modules over them.

## A natural flow

The action of $\mathbb{R}_+^*$ on all these objects is simply given by acting on the grading through
$$|\cdot|\mapsto |\cdot|^t:=e^{t\mathrm{ln}|\cdot|}.$$
