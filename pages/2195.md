## Idea

A _Fourier transformation_ is an [[isomorphism]] between the algebra of [[complex numbers|complex]]-valued [[functions]] on a suitable [[topological group]] and a [[convolution product]]-algebra structure on the [[Pontrjagin dual]] group.

The study of the Fourier transform is the main subject of [[Fourier analysis]] and, together with its generalizations like [[wavelet transform]], of [[harmonic analysis]]. Regarding that, with an appropriate choice of functional spaces, the Fourier transform has an inverse, each function can be represented as a Fourier inverse of some function, which amounts to a decomposition into an integral over a Haar measure along some basis. Thus the function gets *analysed* into *harmomics*. 

For noncommutative topological groups, instead of continuous characters one should consider [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] unitary [[representation]]s, which makes the subject much more difficult. There are also generalizations in [[noncommutative geometry]], see [[quantum group Fourier transform]].   


## Definition


Let $G$ be a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] [[abelian group|abelian]] [[topological group]] with [[Haar measure|invariant (= Haar) measure]] $\mu$. Then for each $f\in L_1(G,\mu)$, define its __Fourier transform__ $\hat{f}$ as a function on its [[Pontrjagin dual]] group $\hat{G}$ given by

$$
\hat{f}(\chi) = \int_G f(x) \widebar{\chi(x)} d\mu(x),\,\,\,\chi\in\hat{G}.
$$


The Fourier transform of $f\in L_1(G,\mu)$ is always continuous and bounded on $\hat{G}$; the transform of the [[convolution]] of two functions is the product of the transforms of each of the functions separately.


## Examples

### On the circle and the integers

In the classical case of __Fourier series__, where $G=\mathbb{Z}$ (the additive group of [[integers]]) and $\hat{G}=S^1$ (the [[circle group]]), the Fourier transform restricts to a unitary operator between the [[Hilbert spaces]] $L_2(S^1,d t)$ and $l_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the Fourier coefficients are the numbers 

$$c_n := \hat{f}(\chi_n) = \int_0^1 f(t) e^{-2\pi i n t} d t,$$

for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, where the functions $\chi_n(t)= e^{2\pi i n t}$ form an orthonormal basis of $L_2(S^1,d t)$. The Fourier transform $\hat{\chi_n}$ is then viewed as the  $\mathbb{Z}$-series $\delta_n$ which in the $n$-th place has $1$ and elsewhere $0$. The Fourier transform replaces the operator of differentiation $d/d t$ by the operator of multiplication by the series $\{2\pi i n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$.

### On compact abelian groups and discrete groups

In general, if $G$ is a [[compact space|compact]] abelian group (whose [[Pontrjagin dual]] is [[discrete group|discrete]]), one can normalize the invariant measure by $\mu(G)=1$ and $\hat{\mu}(X)=card(X)$ for $X\subset\hat{G}$. Then the Fourier transform restricts to a unitary operator from $L_2(X,\mu)$ to $L_2(\hat{G},\hat{\mu})$. 


### On cyclic groups (the discretized circle)

* [[discrete Fourier transform]]

### On Cartesian spaces

Throughout, let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and write $\mathbb{R}^n$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and write $(-) \cdot (-)$ for the canonical [[inner product]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$:

$$
  k \cdot x \;\coloneqq\; \underoverset{a = 1}{n}{\sum} k_n x^n
  \,.
$$

In the following by a [[smooth function]] $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ we mean a smooth function with values in the [[complex numbers]].

###### Definition
**([[Schwartz space]] of [[smooth functions]] with rapidly decaying [[partial derivatives]])**


A [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[smooth function]] $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is said to have _rapidly decaying [[partial derivatives]]_ if for all $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{N}^{n}$ we have

$$
  \underset{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}{sup} {\vert  x^\beta \partial^\alpha f(x) \vert}
  \;\lt\; \infty
  \,.
$$

Write 

$$
  \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

for the sub-[[vector space]] on the functions with rapidly decreasing partial derivatives regarded as a [[topological vector space]] for the [[Frechet space]] struzcture induced by the [[seminorms]]

$$
  p_{\alpha, \beta}(f) \coloneqq \underset{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}{sup} {\vert  x^\beta \partial^\alpha f(x) \vert}
  \,.
$$

This is also called the _[[Schwartz space]]_.
