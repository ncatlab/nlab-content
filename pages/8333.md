## Idea

Given an [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$, write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for its [[category of chain complexes]]. The [[relation]] of [[chain homotopy]] is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[hom sets]] of this category. 

The resulting category with the same objects and chain homotopy equivalence classes as morphisms

$$
  \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{A}) \coloneqq Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})_{/\sim}
$$

is often call the "homotopy category of chain complexes". 

On the other hand the [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}))$ in the sense of the result of [[localization]] at the [[quasi-isomorphisms]] is traditionally called the [[derived category]] $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{A})$ of $\mathcal{A}$:

$$
  \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{A}) \coloneqq Ho(Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}))
  \,.
$$
