## Definition

Given an [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$, write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for its [[category of chain complexes]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[relation]] of [[chain homotopy]] is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[hom sets]] of this category. 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{A}) \coloneqq Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})
$$

for the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[chain complexes]], and whose [[morphisms]] between objects $C_\bullet, D_\bullet$ are chain homotopy-equivalence classes

$$
  K(\mathcal{A})(C_\bullet, D_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})(C_\bullet, D_\bullet)_{\sim_{ch}}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Analogous to the variants discussed at _[[category of chain complexes]]_ one considers also the [[full subcategories]]

$$
  K^{+,-,b}(\mathcal{A}) \hookrightarrow K(\mathcal{A})
$$

on the chain complexes which are bounded above or bounded below or bounded, respectively.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The category $K(\mathcal{A})$ is sometimes called the "homotopy category of chain complexes". But beware that there is another category that also and more properly deserves to be called by this name:

the _[[homotopy category]]_ $Ho(Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}))$ in the sense of the result of [[localization]] at the [[chain maps]] that are [[quasi-isomorphisms]] is traditionally called the _[[derived category]]_ $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{A})$ of $\mathcal{A}$:

$$
  \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{A}) \coloneqq Ho(Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #ProjectionFunctor}
###### Definition

By construction there is a canonical [[functor]]

$$
  Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to K(\mathcal{A})
$$

which is the [[identity]] on objects and the [[quotient]] [[projection]] on [[hom-sets]].

## Properties

### Additive category structure

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Under componentwise addition of [[chain maps]], $K(\mathcal{A})$ is an [[additive category]].

=--

In fact using the [[abelian group]]-structure on chain maps, we can equivalently reformulate the quotient by chain homotopy as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet, D_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, let 

$$
  NHt(C_\bullet, D_\bullet) \hookrightarrow Ch_\bullet(C_\bullet, D_\bullet)
$$

be the [[abelian group|abelian]] [[subgroup]] on those [[chain maps]] which are [[null homotopy|null homotopic]], hence for which there is a [[chain homotopy]] to the [[zero morphism]].


=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C_\bullet, D_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, there is an [[natural isomorphism]] of [[abelian groups]]

$$
  K(\mathcal{A})(C_\bullet, D_\bullet)
  \simeq
  Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})/NHt(C_\bullet, D_\bullet)
$$

of the [[hom-objects]] in $K(\mathcal{A})$ with the [[quotient group]] of all chain maps by those whose are null homotopic. 
=--

### Triangulated category structure

+-- {: .num_defn #DistinguishedTriangles}
###### Definition

A **[[distinguished triangle]]** in $K(\mathcal{A})$ is a sequence of [[morphisms]] of the form

$$
  Y_\bullet \to (X\sslash Y)_\bullet \to X[1]_\bullet \stackrel{}{\to} Y[1]_\bullet
  \,,
$$

where $C[1]_\bullet$ denotes the [[suspension of a chain complex]], which is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[image]] under the projection fuctor def. \ref{ProjectionFunctor} of a [[mapping cone]] sequence in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ 

$$
  Y_\bullet \stackrel{}{\hookrightarrow} cone(f)_\bullet
   \stackrel{}{\to}
  X[1]_\bullet
   \stackrel{f[1]_\bullet}{\to}
  Y[1]_\bullet
$$

of a [[chain map]] $f_\bullet : X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$.

=--

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

With 

* [[shift functor]] given by [[suspension of a chain complex|suspension of chain complexes]];

* [[distinguished triangles]] as in def. \ref{DistinguishedTriangles}

the category $K(\mathcal{A})$ is a [[triangulated category]].

=--
