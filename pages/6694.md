###### Proposition
**(maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper)**

Let $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that 

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]];

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]].

Then $f$ is 

1. a [[closed map]];

1. a [[proper map]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For the first statement, we need to show that if $C \subset X$ is a [[closed subset]] of $X$, then also $f(C) \subset Y$ is a closed subset of $Y$.

Now 

1. since [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]] it follows that $C \subset C$ is also compact;

1. since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] it then follows that $f(C) \subset Y$ is compact;

1. since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] it finally follow that $f(C)$ is also closed in $Y$.

For the second statement we need to show that if $C \subset Y$ is a [[compact topological space|compact subset]], then also its [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(C)$ is compact.

Now 

1. since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]] it follows that $C \subse Y$ is closed;

1. since [[pre-images]] under continuous of closed subsets are closed, also $f^{-1}(C) \subset X$ is closed;

1. since [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]], it follows that $f^{-1}(C)$ is compact.

###### Corollary ######
**(continuous bijections from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphisms)**

Let $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that 

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]];

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]].

1. $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[bijection]] of [[sets]].

Then $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]], i. e. its [[inverse function]] $Y \to X$ is also a [[continuous function]].

In particular then both $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ are [[compact Hausdorff spaces]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $g \colon Y \to X$ for the [[inverse function]] of $f$. 

We need to show that $g$ is continuous, hence that for $U \subset X$ an [[open subset]], then also its [[pre-image]] $g^{-1}(U) \subset Y$ is open in $Y$.
By passage to [[complements]], this is equivalent to the statement that for $C \subset X$ a [[closed subset]] then the [[pre-image]] $g^{-1}(C) \subset Y$ is also closed in $Y$. 

But since $g$ is the [[inverse function]] to $f$, its [[pre-images]] are the [[images]] of $f$. Hence the last statement above equivalently says that $f$ sends closed subsets to closed subsets. This is true by prop. \ref{MapsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}.

###### Remark

The idea captured by corollary \ref{ContinuousBijectionsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreHomeomorphisms} is that [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorffness]] is about having "enough" [[open sets]] whilst [[compact topological space|compactness]] is about having "not too many". Thus a [[compact Hausdorff space]] has both "enough" and "not too many". This theorem says that both conditions are at their limit: if we try to have more open sets, we lose compactness. If we try to have fewer open sets, we lose Hausdorffness.
