## Idea


A _transseries_ is an expansion of a [[function]] $f(x)$ as a [[power series]] in a [[vector]] $z$ whose components are fixed functions of $x$. 

In application to [[perturbative quantum field theory]] one is interested in functions of the [[coupling constant]] $g$ and the relevant expansions are in terms of $x=g$ or $x=g^2$ and $z_1=x$ for the contributions of the [[Feynman perturbation series]] and  $z_2=e^{-c/x}$for capturing [[non-perturbative effects]]. Also $z_3=\log x/x_0$.
