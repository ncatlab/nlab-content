A _compact element_ in a [[poset]] $P$ is a [[compact object]] in the poset regarded as a [[(0,1)-category]]: homs out of it commute with [[directed colimit|directed]] [[joins]]:

$c \in P$ is compact precisely if for every directed subset $\{d_i\}$ of $P$ we have

$$
  (c \leq \vee_i d_i )
  \Leftrightarrow
  \vee_i (c \leq d_i)
  \,.
