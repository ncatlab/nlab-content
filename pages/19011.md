## Idea

By the old [[brane scan]] there is a [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] for a [[superstring]] on 4d [[super-Minkowski spacetime]].

Due to the 4d [[Fierz identity]] 

$$
  \Gamma_a \psi \left( \overline{\psi} \Gamma^a \psi\right)
  \;= 0\;
$$

(e.g. [Ravera 18, (A.17)](#Ravera18))

Being of [[codimension]]=2, this is a [[defect brane]].
