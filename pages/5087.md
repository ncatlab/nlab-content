###### Definition

A [[geometric morphism]] between [[toposes]] $(f^* \dashv f_*) : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{F}$ is **surjective** or a **geometric surjection** if it satisfies the following equivalent criteria:

* its [[inverse image functor]] $f_*$ is [[faithful functor|faithful]] (in contrast to the [[direct image]] being [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] for a [[geometric embedding]] ); 

* its [[inverse image functor]] $f^*$ is [[conservative 
functor|conservative]];

* the components $X \to f_* f^* X$ of the [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction unit]] are [[monomorphism]]s, for all $X \in \mathcal{F}$;

* $f^*$ induces a injective homomorphism of [[subobject]] [[lattice]]s
  
  $$
    Sub(X) \hookrightarrow Sub(f^* X)
  $$

  for all $X \in \mathcal{F}$;

* $f^*$ reflects the order on [[subobject]]s;

* $(f^* \dashv f_*)$ is a [[comonadic adjunction]].

The equivalence of these condition appears for instance as [MacLaneMoerdijk, VII 4. lemma 3 and prop. 4](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

## Properties

### Surjection/embedding factorization

+-- {: .num_prop #CofreeAlgebraFunctorIsSurjective}
###### Observation

For $T : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}$ a [[left exact functor|left exact]] [[comonad]] the cofree algebra functor

$$
  F : \mathcal{E} \to T CoAlg(\mathcal{E})
$$

to the [[topos of coalgebras]] is a geometric surjection.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion at [[topos of coalgebras]] the [[inverse image]] is the [[forgetful functor]] to the underlying $\mathcal{E}$-objects. This is clearly a [[faithful functor]].

###### Proposition

Up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], every geometric surjection is of this form.

=--

This appears for instance as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, VII 4., prop 4](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With observation \ref{CofreeAlgebraFunctorIsSurjective} we only need to show that if $f : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{F}$ is surjective, then there is $T$ such that

$$
  \array{
     \mathcal{E} &\stackrel{f}{\to}& \mathcal{F}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{F}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     && T CoAlg(\mathcal{E})
  }
  \,.
$$

For this, take $T := f^* f_*$. This is a [[left exact functor]] by definition of [[geometric morphism]]. By assumption on $f$ and using the equivalent definition of def. \ref{EquivalentDefinitions} we have that $f^*$ is a [[conservative functor]]. This means that the conditions of the [[monadicity theorem]] are met, so so $f^*$ is a [[monadic functor|comonadic functor]].

## Examples

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $f : X \to Y$ a [[continuous function]] between [[topological space]]s and $(f^* \dashv f_*) : Sh(X) \to Sh(Y)$ the corresponding geometric morphisms of [[sheaf topos]]es, $f$ is a surjection precisely if $(f^* \dashv f_*)$ is a surjective geometric morphism.
