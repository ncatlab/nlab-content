## Idea

For $(X, \omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], a **real polarization** is a [[foliation]] of $X$ by [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] with respect to $\omega$.

After a choice of [[prequantum line bundle]] $\nabla$ lifting $\omega$, a **[[Bohr-Sommerfeld leaf]]** of a real polarization is a leaf on which the prequantum line bundle is not just flat, but also trivializable as a [[circle bundle]] with connection.

In [[geometric quantization]] the space of [[states]] is obtained as the subspace of the space of [[sections]] of a [[prequantum line bundle]] over a symplectic manifold consisting of _horizontal sections_, i.e. sections whose [[covariant derivative]] along the [[leafs]] of a real polarization is constant.
