## Idea

For a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$ regarded as the [[phase space]] of a [[physical system]], a choice of _polarization_ is, locally, a choice of decomposition of the [[coordinates]] on $X$ into "[[canonical coordinates]]" and "[[canonical momenta]]".

The archtypical example is that where $X = T^* \Sigma$ is the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]] $\Sigma$. In this case the canonical [[canonical coordinates]] are those parameterizing $\Sigma$ itself, while the canonical [[canonical momenta]] are coordinates on each [[fiber]] of the cotangent bundle.

But for general symplectic manifolds there is no such canonical choice of coordinates and momenta. Moreover, in general there is not even a global notion of canonical momenta. Instead, a choice of polarization is a [[foliation]] of phase space by [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] and

* the "[[canonical coordinates]]" are coordinates on the corresponding [[leaf space]] (parameterizing the leaves);

* the "[[canonical momenta]]" are coordinates along each leaf. If there is no _typical leaf_ then this is not a globally defined notion, only the polarization itself is.

Locally this is a choice of [[coordinate patch]] $\phi : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \to X$ such that the [[symplectic form]] takes the form

$$
  \phi^* \omega = \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbf{d} q^i \wedge \mathbf{d}p_i
$$

where the $\{q^i : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\}$ are the canonical coordinates on the first $\mathbb{R}^n$-factor of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, and where $\{p_o : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\}$ are canonical coordinates  on the second $\mathbb{R}^n$-factor.

### Quantum states and wave functions

Upon ([[geometric quantization|geometric]]) [[quantization]] of the physical system described by the [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$ a [[quantum state]] is supposed to be a function on $X$ -- or rather a [[section]] of a [[prequantum line bundle]] which is a "wave-function that only depends on the canonical coordinates", not on the canonical momenta. In terms of polarizations this is formalized by saying that a [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|quantum state]] is a section which is [[covariant derivative|covariant constant]] along the [[leaves]] of the polarization (along the "momentum direction"). 

### Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves

After a choice of [[prequantum line bundle]] $\nabla$ lifting $\omega$, a **[[Bohr-Sommerfeld leaf]]** of a (real) polarization is a [[leaf]] on which the prequantum line bundle is not just flat, but also trivializable as a [[circle bundle]] with connection.

### Liouville integrability

If a polarization on an $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold is generated from $n$ [[Hamiltonian vector fields]] whose [[Hamiltonians]] commute with each other under the [[Poisson bracket]] (and one of them is regarded as that generating time evolution of a mechanical system) then one speaks of a [[Liouville integrable system]].
