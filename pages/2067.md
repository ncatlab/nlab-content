# Definition #

## in categories ##

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a [[functor]]. A [[morphism]] $f : x_1 \to x_2$ in the [[category]] $X$ is _cartesian_ with respect to $p$, or _$p$-cartesian. If it satisfies the following property:

$$
  \array{
    x'
    \\
    \downarrow^{\exists!} & \searrow^{\forall h}
    \\
    x &\stackrel{f}{\to}& y
  }
  \;\;\;
  \stackrel{p}{\mapsto}
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    p(x')
    \\
    \downarrow^{\forall g} & \searrow^{p(h)}
    \\
    p(x) &\stackrel{p(f)}{\to}& p(y)
  }
$$

If for every morphism in $Y$ there is a lift through $p$ that is a cartesian morphism, one says that $p$ is a [[Grothendieck fibration]].


## in $(\infty,1)$-categories

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[simplicial set]]s that may be the [[quasi-category]] incarnation of an [[infinity-functor]] of [[(infinity,1)-category|(âˆž,1)-categories]].

Assume that $p$ is an [[inner fibration]] of simplicial sets.

Then an edge $f : x \to y$ in $X$ is _$p$-cartesian_ if the induced morphism

$$
  X_{/f} \to X_{/y} \times_{S_{/p(y)}} S_{/p(f)}
$$

is acyclic [[Kan fibration]].

This is def 2.4.1.1 in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]].
