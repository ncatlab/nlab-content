## Definition

A _spinor bundle_ an a [[smooth manifold]] with [[spin structure]] is a $\rho$-[[associated bundle]] associated to the [[spin group]]-[[principal bundle]] lifting the [[tangent bundle]], for $\rho : \mathbf{B} Spin \to $ [[Vect]] a [[representation]] of the [[spin group]].

A [[section]] of a spinor bundle is called a **spinor**.

In [[physics]] sections of spinor bundles model matter [[relativistic particle|particle]]s: [[fermion]]. See [[spinors in Yang-Mills theory]].
