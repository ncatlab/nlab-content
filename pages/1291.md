For any two [[full subcategory|full subcategories]] $S$ and $T$ of an abelian category $A$, define their __Gabriel product__ $S\bullet T$ as the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $M$ such that they fit in an exact sequence of the
form 
$$
0\to N\to M\to P\to 0
$$
where $N$ is an object in $S$ and $P$ is an object in $S$.

When restricted to the class of [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing subcategories]], Gabriel multiplication is associative; if $A$ is small then the topologizing subcategories make a semiring with respect to the commutative operation $\cap$ and Gabriel multiplication; in particular $\bullet$ is left and right distributive with respect to intersection of topologizing subcategories.  

In the case of the abelian category of modules over a ring, the Gabriel multiplication is sometimes expressed in terms of filters of ideals, rather than abelian subcategories.
