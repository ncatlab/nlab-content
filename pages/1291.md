## Definition

For any two [[full subcategory|full subcategories]] $S$ and $T$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$, define their __Gabriel product__ $S\bullet T$ as the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $M$ such that $M$ fits in a short [[exact sequence]] of the
form 

$$
  0\to N\to M\to P\to 0
$$

where $N$ is an object in $S$ and $P$ is an object in $T$.

In the case of the abelian category of modules over a ring, the Gabriel multiplication is sometimes expressed as [[Gabriel composition of filters]] of ideals, rather than in terms of abelian subcategories.


## Properties

When restricted to the class of [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing subcategories]], Gabriel multiplication is [[associativity|associative]]; if $A$ is [[small category|small]] then the topologizing subcategories make a [[semiring]] with respect to the commutative operation $\cap$ and Gabriel multiplication; in particular $\bullet$ is left and right distributive with respect to intersection of topologizing subcategories.
