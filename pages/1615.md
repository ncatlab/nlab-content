## Idea

A _local net of observables_ is the assignment associated to a [[quantum field theory]] of [[algebra]]s of local [[observables]] to pieces of [[spacetime]].

In the context of [[AQFT]] the structure of local nets is used as the very axiomatization of what a quantum field theory is (as opposed to the context of [[FQFT]], where instead the [[state]]-propagation is used as the basic axiom).


## Definition

In the literature there is a certain variance and flexibility of what precisely the axioms on a local net of observables are, though the core aspects are always the same: it is a [[copresheaf]] of ([[C-star algebra|C-star]] [[associative algebra|algebra]] s) on pieces of [[spacetime]] such that algebras assigned to [[causal locality|causally disconnected]] regions commute inside the algebra assigned to any joint neighbourhood. 

Historically this was first formulated for [[Minkowski spacetime]] only, where it is known as the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]. Later it was pointed out ([BrunettiFredenhagen](#BrunettiFredenhagen)) that the axioms easily and usefully generalize to arbitrary [[spacetime]]s. 

We give the modern general formulation first, and then comment on its restriction to special situations.

### Basic general definition

+-- {: .num_defn #CatOfSpacetimeEmbeddings}
###### Definition

Write $LorSp$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[object]]s are [[spacetime]] manifolds; ([[Lorentzian manifold]]s equipped with a time-orientation);

* [[morphism]] are _causal_ [[isometry|isometric]] [[embedding]].

Here we say a morphism $f : X \hookrightarrow Y$ is a **causal embedding** if for every two points $x_1,x_2 \in X$ we have that $f(x_1)$ is in the [[future]] of $f(x_2)$ in $Y$ only if $x_1$ is in the future of $x_2$ in $X$.

=--


Write $Alg$ for a suitable [[category]] of [[associative algebra]]s. Usually this is taken to be the category of [[C-star algebra]]s or that of [[von Neumann algebra]]s. Write

$$
  Alg_{inc} \hookrightarrow Alg
$$

for the [[subcategory]] on the [[monomorphism]]s.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **causally local net of observables** is a [[functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{A} : LorSp \to Alg_{inc} \to Alg
$$

such that whenever $X_1 \coprod X_2 \hookrightarrow X$ is a causal embedding, def. \ref{CatOfSpacetimeEmbeddings}, we have that $\mathcal{A}(X_1) \subset \mathcal{A}(X)$ commutes with $\mathcal{A}(X_2) \subset \mathcal{A}(X)$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The locality [[axiom]] encodes the the physical property known as [[Einstein-causality]] or micro-causality, which states that physical effects do not propagate faster that the speed of light.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Many _auxiliary_ [[operator]]s in [[quantum field theory]] do _not_ satisfy causal locality: for instance operators associate to [[current]]s in [[gauge theory]]. The idea is that those operators that actually do qualify as _[[observables]]_ do satisfy the axiom, however, i.e. in particular those that are [[gauge symmetry|gauge invariant]].

=--

### Extra axioms

#### Strong locality

Commutativity of spacelike separated observables can be argued to capture only part of [[causal locality]]. 

A natural stronger requirement is that [[spacelike]] separated regions of [[spacetime]] are literally [independent quantum subsystems](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum%20mechanics#Subsystems) of any larger region. By the formalization of _independent subsystem_ in [[quantum mechanics]] this means the following:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A local net $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies **Einstein locality** if for every causal embedding $X_1 \coprod X_2 \to X$ the [subsystems](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum%20mechanics#Subsystems) 

$$
  \mathcal{A}(X_1) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}(X)
$$

and 

$$
  \mathcal{A}(X_2) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}(X)
$$

are _independent_ meaning that the algebra $\mathcal{A}(X_1) \vee \mathcal{A}(X_2) \in \mathcal{A}(X)$ which they generate is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[tensor product]] $\mathcal{A}(X_1) \otimes \mathcal{A}(X_2)$.

This appears as ([BrunettiFredenhagen, 5.3.1, axiom 4](#BrunettiFredenhagen)).

+-- {: .num_observation}
###### Observation

A local net  is Einstein local precisely if it is a [[monoidal functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{A} : (LorSp, \coprod) \to (Alg, \otimes)
  \,.
$$

=--


This appears as ([BrunettiFredenhagen, 5.3.1, theorem 1](#BrunettiFredenhagen)).


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Einstein locality implies causal locality, but is stronger.

=--

Other properties implied by Einstein locality are sometimes extracted as separate axioms. For instance the condition that for $X_1 \coprod X_2 \to X$ a causal embedding, we have

$$
  \mathcal{A}(X_1) \cap \mathcal{A}(X_2) = \mathbb{C}
  \,.
$$


#### Time-slice axiom

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A local net is said to satisfy the **[[time slice axiom]]** if whenever 

$$
  i : X_1 \to X_2
$$

is a causal embedding of [[globally hyperbolic]] [[spacetime]]s such that $X_1$ contains a [[Cauchy surface]] of $X_2$, then 

$$
  \mathcal{A}(i) : \mathcal{A}(X_1) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   \mathcal{A}(X_2)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

### General

The axioms of local nets on general spacetimes were first articulated in

* [[Romeo Brunetti]], [[Klaus Fredenhagen]], _Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds_ ([arXiv:0901.2063](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2063))

### In perturbation theory

The observation that in [[perturbation theory]] the [[renormalization|Stückelberg-Bogoliubov-Epstein-Glaser]] local [[S-matrix|S-matrices]] yield a [[local net of observables]] was first made in 

* V. Il'in, D. Slavnov, _Observable algebras in the S-matrix approach_ Theor. Math. Phys. **36** , 32 (1978)

which was however mostly ignored and forgotten. It is taken up again in

* [[Romeo Brunetti]], [[Klaus Fredenhagen]], _Microlocal Analysis and Interacting Quantum Field Theories: Renormalization on Physical Backgrounds_  Commun.Math.Phys.208:623-661 (2000) ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/9903028))
