## Idea

Under suitable circumstances, forming the [[integral]] of a [[differential form]] may be understood as passing to the [[cohomology]]-[[equivalence class]] of that differential form in a suitable [[chain complex]].

Examples of this appear in the constructions discussed at [[Lie integration]] and at [[BV-BRST formalism]], where cohomological integration is used as a way to formalize the idea of the [[path integral]]. (See at _[The BV-complex and homological (path-)integration](BV-BRST+formalism#HomologicalIntegration)_)

While the idea has been around (as witnessed by the references at _[[Lie integration]]_ and _[[BV-BRST formalism]]_) a comprehensive and dedicated theory, or a published account thereof, currently seems to be missing. But see the [References](#References) below.
