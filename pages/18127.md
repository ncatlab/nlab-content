This page is a detailed introduction to basic [[topology]].
Starting from scratch (required background is just a basic concept of _[[sets]]_), and amplifying motivation from [[analysis]],
it first develops standard [[point-set topology]] ([[topological spaces]]).
In passing, some basics of [[category theory]] make an informal appearance,
used to transparently summarize some conceptually important aspects of the theory, such as the [[reflective subcategory|reflection]] into
[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[sober topological spaces]].
The second part introduces some basics of [[homotopy theory]], mostly the [[fundamental group]],
and ends with their first application to the classification of [[covering spaces]].

In order to handle topological spaces, to compute their properties and distinguish them, it
turns out to be useful to consider not just continuity within a topological space, but also
continuous deformations of [[continuous functions]] _between_ topological spaces. This is the
concept of _[[homotopy]]_, and its study is _[[homotopy theory]]_. We introduce the basic concept
and consider its most fundamental application: the [[fundamental group]] and its relation to the
classification of [[covering spaces]].


## Homotopy
  {#Homotopy}

We have seen above that for $n \geq 1$  then the [[open ball]] $B_0^\circ(1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is _not_ [[homeomorphic]] to, notably, the point $\ast = \mathbb{R}^0$ (example \ref{OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn}, theorem \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension}). Nevertheless, intuitively the $n$-ball is a "continuous deformation" of the point, obtained as the radius of the $n$-ball tends to zero.

This intuition is made precise by observing that there is a [[continuous function]] out of the [[product topological space]]
(example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) of the open ball with the closed [[interval]]

$$
  \eta \colon [0,1] \times B_0^\circ(1)  \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which is given by rescaling:

$$
  (t,x) \mapsto t \cdot x
  \,.
$$

This continuously interpolates between the open ball and the point in that for $t = 1$ then it restricts to the defining inclusion $B_0^\circ(1)$, while for $t = 0$ then it restricts to the map constant on the origin.

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/ShrinkingBalls.png" width="200">
</div>

We may summarize this situation by saying that there is a
[[diagram]] of [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    B_0^\circ(1) \times \{0\}
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{x \mapsto 0}}
    \\
    [0,1] \times B_0^\circ(1)
    &\overset{(t,x) \mapsto t \cdot x}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    \uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{inclusion}}
    \\
    B_0^\circ(1) \times \{1\}
  }
$$

Such "continuous deformations" are called _[[homotopies]]_:

A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$

$g \;\colon\; Y \longrightarrow X$, and

1. [[left homotopies]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, from the two composites to the identity:

## Connected components
 {#ConnectedComponents}

Using the concept of [[homotopy]] one obtains the basic tool of [[algebraic topology]], namely the construction of algebraic [[homotopy invariants]] of topological spaces. We introduce the simplest and indicate their use.


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

A [[homotopy]] between two points

$x,y \;\colon\; \ast \to X$

is a continuous [[path]] between these points.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #pi0}
###### Definition
**(connected components)**

The set of [[homotopy classes]] of points in a [[topological space]] $X$ is called its set of
_path-[[connected components]]_, denoted.

$$
  \pi_0(X) \in Set
  \,.
$$

If $\pi_0(X) \simeq \ast$ consists of a single element, we say that $X$ is a _[[path-connected topological space]]_.

If $f \colon X \to Y$ is a [[continuous map]] between [[topological spaces]], then on [[homotopy classes]] of points it induces a [[function]] between the corresponding connected components, which we denote by:

$$
  \pi_0(f) \;\colon\; \pi_0(X) \longrightarrow \pi_0(Y)
  \,.
$$

=--

This construction is evidently compatible with [[composition]], in that

$$
  \pi_0(g \circ f) = \pi_0(g) \circ \pi_0(f)
$$

and it evidently is [[unitality|unital]], in that

$$
  \pi_0(id_X) = id_{\pi_{0}(X)}
  \,.
$$

One summarizes this by saying that $\pi_0$ is a _[[functor]]_ from the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] to the [[category]] [[Set]] of [[sets]], denoted

$$
  \pi_0 \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

An immediate but important consequence is this:

+-- {: .num_prop #ConnectedComponentsDistinctImpliesHeomeClassesDistinct}
###### Proposition

If two [[topological spaces]] have sets of [[connected components]] that are not in [[bijection]], then those spaces are not [[homeomorphic]] to each other:

$$
  \pi_0(X) \neq \pi_0(Y)
  \;\;\;
    \Rightarrow
  \;\;\,
  X \underset{homeo}{\neq} Y
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $\pi_0$ is [[functor|functorial]], it immediately follows that it sends [[isomorphisms]] to [[isomorphisms]], hence [[homeomorphisms]] to [[bijections]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     & f \circ g = id \;\;and\;\; g \circ f = id
    \\
    \Rightarrow \;\;\;\;\;\;&
    \pi_0(f \circ g) = \pi_0(id) \;\;and \;\; \pi_0(g \circ f) = \pi_0(id)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;\;
    &
    \pi_0(f) \circ \pi_0(g) = id \;\;and \;\; \pi_0(g) \circ \pi_0(f) = id
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

This means that we may use path connected components as a first "topological invariant" that allows us to distinguish some topological spaces.

+-- {: principle}
**principle of algebraic topology**

$\,\,$ _Use topological invariants to distinguish topological spaces._

=--


As an example for how this is being used, we have the following proof of a simple special case of the [[topological invariance of dimension]] (theorem \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension}):


+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalInvarianceOfDimensionFirstSimpleCase}
###### Proposition
**([[topological invariance of dimension]] -- first simple case)**

The [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ are not [[homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume there were a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  f \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2
$$

we will derive a contradiction. If $f$ is a homeomorphism, then clearly so is its restriction to the [[topological subspaces]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) obtained by removing $0 \in \mathbb{R}^1$ and $f(0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

$$
  f
    \;\colon\;
  (\mathbb{R}^1-\{0\})
    \longrightarrow
  (\mathbb{R}^2 - \{f(0)\})
  \,.
$$


It follows that we would get a bijection of [[connected components]] between $\pi_0(\mathbb{R}^1 - \{0\})$ and $\pi_0(\mathbb{R}^2  - \{f(0)\})$. But clearly the first set has two elements, while the second has just one:

$$
  \pi_0(\mathbb{R}^1-\{0\})
    \;\neq\;
  \pi_0(\mathbb{R}^2 - \{f(0)\})
  \,.
$$


=--

The key lesson of the proof of prop. \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimensionFirstSimpleCase} is its strategy:


+-- {: principle}
**principle of algebraic topology**

$\,\,$ _Use topological invariants to distinguish topological spaces._

=--


Of course in practice one uses more sophisticated invariants than just $\pi_0$.

The next topological invariant after the [[connected components]] is the _[[fundamental group]]:




## Fundamental group
 {#FundamentalGroups}


+-- {: .num_defn #FundamentalGroup}
###### Definition
**(fundamental group)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $x \in X$ be a chosen point. Then write

$$
  \pi_1(X,x)
    \;\in\;
  Grp
$$

for, to start with, the set of [[homotopy classes]] of [[paths]] in $X$ that start and end at $x$. Such paths are also called the continuous [[loops]] in $X$ based at $x$.

1. Under concatenation of loops, $\pi_1(X,x)$ becomes a [[semi-group]].

1. The constant loop is a [[neutral element]] under this composition (thus making $\pi_1(X,x)$ a "[[monoid]]").

1. The  reverse of a loop is its [[inverse]] in $\pi_1(X,x)$, making $\pi_1(X,x)$ indeed into a [[group]].

This is called the _[[fundamental group]]_ of $X$ at $x$.

=--

The following picture indicates the four non-equivalent non-trivial generators of the [[fundamental group]] of the
oriented [[surface]] of [[genus of a surface|genus]] 2:

<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/FundamentalGroupOfGenus2Surface.png" width="500">

> graphics grabbed from [Lawson 03](#Lawson03)




Again, this operation is [[functor|functorial]], now on the [[category]] $Top^{\ast/}$
of [[pointed topological spaces]], whose [[objects]] are
topological spaces equipped with a chosen point, and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]]
$f \colon X \to Y$ that take the chosen basepoint of $X$ to that of $Y$:

$$
  \pi_1 \;\colon\; Top^{\ast/} \longrightarrow Grp
  \,.
$$

As $\pi_0$, so also $\pi_1$ is a topological invariant. As before, we may use this to prove a simple case of the theorem of the [[topological invariance of dimension]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplyConnected}
###### Definition

A topological space $X$ for which

1. $\pi_0(X) \simeq \ast$ ([[path-connected topological space|path connected]], def. \ref{pi0})

1. $\pi_1(X,x) \simeq 1$ (the [[fundamental group]] is [[trivial group|trivial]], def. \ref{FundamentalGroup}),

is called _[[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]_.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #topologicalInvarianceOfDimensionSecondSimpleCase}
###### Proposition
**([[topological invariance of dimension]] -- second simple case)**

There is _no_ [[homeomorphism]] between $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume there were such a homeomorphism $f$; we will derive a contradiction.

If $f$ is a homeomorphism, then so is its restriction to removing the origin from $\mathbb{R}^2$
and $f(0)$ from $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$
  (\mathbb{R}^2 - \{0\})
    \longrightarrow
  (\mathbb{R}^3 - \{f(0)\})
  \,.
$$

Thse two spaces are both path-connected, hence $\pi_0$ does not distiguish them.

But they do have different [[fundamental groups]] $\pi_1$:

1. The fundamental group of $\mathbb{R}^{2} - \{0\}$ is $\mathbb{Z}$ (counting the winding of loops around the removed point).
We discuss this further below in example \ref{FundamentalGroupOfTheCircle}.

1. The fundamental group of $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{f(0)\}$ is trivial: because the single removed point is
no obstruction to sliding loops past it and contracting them.

But since passing to fundamental groups is [[functor|functorial]], the same argument
as in the proof of prop. \ref{ConnectedComponentsDistinctImpliesHeomeClassesDistinct}
shows that $f$ cannot be an [[isomorphism]], hence not a [[homeomorphism]].


=--

We now discuss a "dual incarnation" of fundamental groups, which often helps to compute them.




## Covering spaces
 {#CoveringSpaces}

+-- {: .num_defn #CoveringSpace}
###### Definition
**(covering space)**

A _[[covering space]]_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a [[continuous map]]

$$
  p \colon E \to X
$$

such that there exists an [[open cover]] $\underset{i}{\sqcup}U_i \to X$, such that restricted
to each $U_i$ then $E \to X$ is [[homeomorphic]] over $U_i$
to the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{ProductTopologicalSpace}) of $U_i$
with the [[discrete topological space]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) on a [[set]] $F_i$

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \times F_i &\longrightarrow&  E
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

For $x \in U_i \subset X$ a point, then the elements in $F_x  = F_i$ are called the _leaves_ of the covering at $x$.

given by taking a complex number to its $k$th power. This may be thought of as the
result of "winding the circle $k$ times around itself".
Precisely, for $k \geq 1$ this is a [[covering space]]

We may think of this as the result of "winding the line around the circle ad infinitum".

set $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[natural numbers]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ActionOfFundamentalGroupOnFibersOfCovering}
###### Definition
**(action of fundamental group on fibers of covering)**

Let $E \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} X$ be a [[covering space]] (def. \ref{CoveringSpace})

Then for $x \in X$ any point, and any choice of element $e \in F_x$ of the [[leaf space]] over $x$,
there is, up to [[homotopy]], a unique way to lift a representative
path in $X$ of an element $\gamma$ of the the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$ (def. \ref{FundamentalGroup}) to a
continuous path in $E$ that starts at $e$. This path necessarily ends at some (other) point $\rho_\gamma(e) \in F_x$
in the same [[fiber]]. This construction provides a [[function]]

$$
  \array{
    \rho &\colon& F_x \times \pi_1(X,x) &\longrightarrow& F_x
    \\
    && (e,\gamma) &\mapsto& \rho_\gamma(e)
  }
$$

from the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[leaf space]] with the [[fundamental group]]. This function
is compatible with the [[group]]-structure on $\pi_1(X,x)$, in that the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    F_x \times \{const_x\} && \longrightarrow && F_x \times \pi_1(X,x)

One says that $\rho$ is an _[[action]]_ or _[[permutation representation]]_ of $\pi_1(X,x)$ on $F_x$.

For $G$ any [[group]], then there is a [[category]] $G Set$ whose [[objects]] are [[sets]]
equipped with an [[action]] of $G$, and whose [[morphisms]] are [[function|functions]] which respect
these actions. The above construction yields a [[functor]]

**([[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[connected topological space|path-connected]] (def. \ref{pi0}),
[[locally path-connected topological space|locally path connected]] (def. \ref{SemiLocallySimplyConnected})
and [[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]] (def. \ref{SemiLocallySimplyConnected}). Then
for any $x \in X$ the functor
$$
  Fib_x \;\colon\; Cov(X) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \pi_1(X,x) Set

$$
from def. \ref{ActionOfFundamentalGroupOnFibersOfCovering} that describes
the [[action]] of the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ on the set of [[leaves]] over $x$
has the following property:

1. every [[isomorphism class]] of $\pi_1(X,x)$-[[actions]] is in the image of the functor (one says: the functor is _[[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]_);

1. for any two covering spaces $E_1, E_2$ of $X$ then the map on [[hom-sets|morphism sets]]

   $$
     Fib_x \;\colon\; Hom_{Cov(X)}(E_1, E_2) \longrightarrow Hom( Fib_x(E_1), Fib_x(E_2) )

   is a [[bijection]] (one says the functor is a _[[fully faithful functor]]_ ).


A functor with these two properties one calls an _[[equivalence of categories]]_:

$$

This has some interesting implications:

Every sufficiently nice topological space $X$ as above has a covering which is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]
(def. \ref{SimplyConnected}). This is the covering corresponding, under the [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]]
(theorem \ref{FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}) to the action of $\pi_1(X)$ on itself.
This is called the _[[universal covering space]]_ $\hat X \to X$. The above theorem implies that the
[[fundamental group]] itself may be recovered as the [[automorphisms]] of the universal covering space:

$$
  \pi_1(X) \simeq Aut_{Cov_{/X}}(\hat X, \hat X)
  \,.
$$

###### Example
**(computing the fundamental group of the circle)**

The covering $\exp(2\pi i(-)) \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \to S^1$ from example \ref{CoveringOfCircleByRealLine}
is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] (def. \ref{SimplyConnected}),  hence must be the [[universal covering space]], up to [[homeomorphism]].

It is fairly straightforward to see that the only [[homeomorphisms]] from $\mathbb{R}^1$ to itself
over $S^1$ are given by [[integer]] translations by $n \in \mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^1
      &&
        \underoverset{\simeq}{t \mapsto t + n}{\longrightarrow}
      &&
    \mathbb{R}^1
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\exp(2 \pi i(-))}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\exp(2 \pi i(-))}}
    \\
    && S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence

$$
  Aut_{Cov_{/S^1}}(\hat S^1, \hat S^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
$$

and hence the [[fundamental group]] of the [[circle]] is the additive group of [[integers]]:

$$
  \pi_1(S^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
