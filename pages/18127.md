This page is a detailed introduction to basic [[topological homotopy theory|topological]] [[homotopy theory]].
We introduce the [[fundamental group]] of [[topological spaces]] and the concept of
[[covering spaces]]. Then we prove the [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]], saying that
they are equivalent to [[permutation representations]] of the fundamental group. This is
a simple topological version of the general principle of _[[Galois theory]]_ and has many
applications. As one example application, we use it to prove that the [[fundamental group of the circle is the integers]].

In order to handle topological spaces, to compute their properties and distinguish them, it
turns out to be useful to consider not just continuity within a topological space, but also
continuous deformations of [[continuous functions]] _between_ topological spaces. This is the
concept of _[[homotopy]]_, and its study is _[[homotopy theory]]_. We introduce the basic concept
and consider its most fundamental application: the [[fundamental group]] and its relation to the
classification of [[covering spaces]].


## Homotopy
  {#Homotopy}

It is clear that for $n \geq 1$ the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ or equivalently the [[open ball]] $B_0^\circ(1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$
is _not_ [[homeomorphic]] to the [[point space]] $\ast = \mathbb{R}^0$ (simply because there is not even a [[bijection]] between the
underlying [[sets]]). Nevertheless, intuitively the $n$-ball is a "continuous deformation" of the point, obtained as the radius of the $n$-ball tends to zero.

This intuition is made precise by observing that there is a [[continuous function]] out of the [[product topological space]]
([this example](Introduction+to+Topology+--+1#BinaryProductTopologicalSpace)) of the open ball with the [[closed interval]]

$$
  \eta \colon [0,1] \times B_0^\circ(1)  \longrightarrow B_0^\circ(1)
$$

which is given by rescaling:

$$
  (t,x) \mapsto t \cdot x
  \,.
$$

This continuously interpolates between the open ball and the point, in that for $t = 1$ it restricts to the identity, while for $t = 0$ it restricts to the map constant on the origin.


We may summarize this situation by saying that there is a
[[diagram]] of [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    B_0^\circ(1) \times \{0\} &\overset{\exists !}{\longrightarrow}& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{const_0}}
    \\
    [0,1] \times B_0^\circ(1)
    &\overset{(t,x) \mapsto t \cdot x}{\longrightarrow}&
    B^\circ_0(1)
    \\
    \uparrow & \nearrow_{\simeq}
    \\
    B_0^\circ(1) \times \{1\}
  }
$$

Such "continuous deformations" are called _[[homotopies]]_:

+-- {: .num_prop #EquivRelHomotopy}
###### Proposition
**([[homotopy]] is an [[equivalence relation]])

Let $X,Y \in $ [[Top]] be two [[topological spaces]].
Write $Hom_{Top}(X,Y)$ for the [[set]] of [[continuous functions]]
from $X$ to $Y$.

Then the relating of being [[homotopy|homotopic]] (def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}) is an [[equivalence relation]]
on this set. The correspnding [[quotient set]]

$$
  [X,Y] \; \coloneqq \; Hom_{Top}(X,Y)/\sim_h
$$

is called the set of _[[homotopy classes]]_ of continuous functions.

Moreover, this equivalence relation is compatible with [[composition]] of continuous functions:

For $X,Y,Z \in $ [[Top]] three topological spaces, there is a unique function


$$
  [X,Y] \times [Y,Z] \longrightarrow [X,Z]
$$

such that the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    Hom_{Top}(X,Y) \times Hom_{Top}(Y,Z)
      &\overset{\circ_{X,Y,Z}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{Top}(X,Z)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    [X,Y] \times [Y,Z] &\longrightarrow& [X,Z]
  }
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that the relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]: A homotopy $f \Rightarrow f$ from a function $f$ to itself is given by
the function which is constant on the topological interval:

$$
  X \times [0,1] \overset{pr_1}{\longrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

This is continuous becaue [[projections]] out of [[product topological spaces]] are continuous, by
the [[universal property]] of the [[Cartesian product]].

To see that the relation is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]: If $\eta \colon f \Rightarrow g$ is a homotopy then

$$
  \array{
    X \times [0,1] &\overset{id_X \times (1-(-))}{\longrightarrow}& X \times [0,1] &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    (x,t) &\mapsto& (x,1-t) &\mapsto&  \eta(x,1-t)
  }
$$

is a homotopy $g \Rightarrow f$. This is continuous because $1-(-)$ is a [[polynomial]] function, and
[[polynomials are continuous]], and because [[Cartesian product]] and [[composition]] of continuous functions
is again continuous.

Finally to see that the relation is [[transitive relation|transitive]]: If $\eta_1 \colon f \Rightarrow g$
and $\eta_2 \colon g \Rightarrow h$ are two composable homotopies, then consider the "$X$-parameterized 
[[path concatenation]]"

$$
  \array{
    X \times [0,1] &\overset{\eta_2 \circ \eta_1}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    (x,t) &\mapsto& 
    \left\{
      \array{
         \eta_1(x,2t) &\vert& t \leq 1/2
         \\
         \eta_{2}(x,2t-1) &\vert& t \leq 1/2
      }
    \right.
  }
  \,.
$$

To see that this is continuous, observe that $\{ X \times [0,1/2] \subset X, X \times [1/2,1] \subset X \}$
is a [[cover]] of $X \times [0,1]$ by [[closed subsets]] (in the [[product topology]]) and
because $\eta_1(-,2(-))$ and $\eta_2(-,2(-)-1)$ are continuous (being composites of 
Cartesian products of continuous functions) and agree on the intersection $X \times \{1/2\}$. Hence
the continuity follows by [this example](Top#ClosedSubspacesGluing).

Finally to see that homotopy respects composition: Let

$$
  \array{
    X
      \overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}
    Y
      \underoverset
        {\underset{f'_2}{\longrightarrow}}
        {\overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}}
        {}
    Z
     \overset{f_3}{\longrightarrow}
    W
  }
$$

be continuous functions, and let

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; f_2 \Rightarrow f'_2
$$

be a homotopy. It is sufficient to show that then there is a homotopy of the form

$$
  f_3 \circ f_2 \circ f_1 \Rightarrow   f_3 \circ f'_2 \circ f_1
  \,.
$$

This is exhibited by the following diagram

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{ (id_X, const_0) }}\downarrow
       &&
     {}^{\mathllap{ (id_Y,const_0) }}\downarrow
       &
     \searrow^{\mathrlap{ f_2}}
     \\
     X \times [0,1]
       &\overset{f_1 \times id_{[0,1]} }{\longrightarrow}&
     Y \times [0,1]
       &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}&
     Z &\overset{f_3}{\longrightarrow}& W
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id_X,  const_1)}}\uparrow
       &&
     {}^{\mathllap{ (id,const_1) } }\uparrow
       &
     \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ f'_2 }}
     \\
     X &\underset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

###### Remark
**([[homotopy category]])**

Prop. \ref{EquivRelHomotopy} means that [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]]
are the [[morphisms]] in a [[category]] whose [[objects]] are still the [[topological spaces]].

This category (at least when restricted to spaces that admit the structure of [[CW-complexes]])
is called the _[[classical homotopy category]]_, often denoted

$$
  Ho(Top)
  \,.
$$

Hence for $X,Y$ topological spaces, then

$$
  Hom_{Ho(Top)}(X,Y) = [X,Y]
$$

Moreover, sending a continuous function to its homotopy class is a [[functor]]

$$
  \kappa \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Ho(Top)
$$

from the ordinary category [[Top]] of topological spaces with actual continuous functions between them.

Let $X,Y \in $ [[Top]] be two [[topological spaces]].

A [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is called a _[[homotopy equivalence]]_ if there exists

1. a continuous function the other way around,

   $$
     g \;\colon\; Y \longrightarrow X

###### Proposition
**([[homotopy equivalence]] is [[equivalence relation]])

Being [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] is an [[equivalence relation]]
on the [[class]] of [[topological spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is immediate from remark \ref{IsomorphismHomotopyEquivalence} by general
properties of [[categories]] and [[functors]].

But for the record we spell it out. This involves the construction already used in the proof
of prop. \ref{EquivRelHomotopy}:

It is clear that the relation it [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].
To see that it is [[transitive relation|transitive]] consider continuous functions


$$
  X
    \underoverset
      {\underset{g_1}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}}
      {}
  Y
   \underoverset
     {\underset{g_2}{\longleftarrow}}
     {\overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}}
     {}
   Z
$$

and homotopies

$$
  g_1 \circ f_1 \Rightarrow id_X
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f_1 \circ g_1 \Rightarrow id_Y
$$

$$
  g_2 \circ f_2 \Rightarrow id_Y
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f_2 \circ g_2 \Rightarrow id_Z
  \,.
$$

We need to produce homotopies of the form

$$
  (g_1 \circ g_2 ) \circ (f_2 \circ f_1) \Rightarrow id_X
$$

and

$$
  (f_2 \circ f_1)  \circ (g_1 \circ g_2 )  \Rightarrow id_Y
  \,.
$$

Now the diagram

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{ (id_X, const_0) }}\downarrow && {}^{\mathllap{(id_Y,const_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{ g_2 \circ f_2}}
     \\
     X \times [0,1] &\overset{f_1 \times id_{[0,1]} }{\longrightarrow}& Y \times [0,1]  &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y &\overset{g_1}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id_X,  const_1)}}\uparrow && {}^{\mathllap{(id,const_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ id_Y }}
     \\
     X &\underset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,,
$$

with $\eta$ one of the given homotopies,
exhibits a homotopy $ (g_1\circ g_2) \circ (f_2 \circ f_1) \Rightarrow g_1 \circ f_1$. Composing this with the 
given homotopy $g_1 \circ f_1 \Rightarrow id_X$ gives the first of the two homotopies required above.
The second one follows by the same construction, just with the lables of the functions exchanged.

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called _[[contractible topological space|contractible]]_
if the unique [[continuous function]] to the [[point space]]

###### Remark
**([[contractible topological spaces]] are the [[terminal objects]] in the [[homotopy category]])**

In view of remark \ref{HomotopyCategory}, a topological space $X$ is [[contractible topological space|contractible]]
(def. \ref{SpaceContractible}) precisely if its image $\kappa(X)$ in the [[classical homotopy category]]
is a [[terminal object]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #BallIsContractible}
###### Example
**([[closed ball]] and [[Euclidean space]] are [[contractible topological space|contractible]])**

Let $B^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be the unit [[open ball]] or [[closed ball]] in [[Euclidean space]].
This is [[contractible topological space|contractible]] (def. \ref{SpaceContractible}):

$$
  p \;\colon\; B^n \overset{\simeq_h}{\longrightarrow} \ast
  \,.
$$

The homotopy inverse function is necessarily constant on a point, we may just as well choose it
to go pick the origin:

$$
  const_0 \;\colon\; \ast \overset{}{\longrightarrow} B^n
  \,.
$$

For one way of composing these functions we have the [[equality]]

$$
  p \circ const_0 = id_\ast
$$

with the [[identity function]]. This is a homotopy by prop. \ref{EquivRelHomotopy}.

The other composite is

$$
  const_0 \circ p = const_0 \;\colon\; B^n \overset{}{\longrightarrow} B^n
  \,.
$$

Hence we need to produce a homotopy

$$
  const_0 \Rightarrow id_{B^n}
$$

This is given by the function

$$
  \array{
    B^n \times [0,1] &\overset{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& B^n
    \\
    (x,t) &\mapsto& t x
  }
  \,,
$$

where on the right we use the multiplication with respect to the standard [[real vector space]]
structure in $\mathbb{R}^n$.


Since the [[open ball]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the whole [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$
([this example](Introduction+to+Topology+--+1#OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn)) it follows with
example \ref{HomotopyEquivalenceHomeomorphism} and example \ref{EquivRelHomotopy}
that also $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a contractible topological space:

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq_h}{\longrightarrow} \ast

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $x, y \in X$ be two points. Write

$$
  P_{x,y} X
$$

for the set of [[paths]] $\gamma$ in $X$ with $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$.

Then [[homotopy relative boundary]] (def. \ref{PathHomotopyRelativeBoundary})
is an [[equivalence relation]] on $P_{x,y}X$.

The corresponding set of [[equivalence classes]] is denoted

$$
  Hom_{\Pi_1(X)}(x,y)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (P_{x,y}X)/\sim

$$

The operation of [[path concatenation]] descends to these equivalence
classes, so that for all $x,y, z \in X$ there is a function

$$
  Hom_{\Pi_1(X)}(x,y)
   \times
  Hom_{\Pi_1(X)}(y,z)
    \longrightarrow
  Hom_{\Pi_1(X)}(x,z)

Moreover, this composition operation is [[associativity|associative]] in the evident sense.

Set of points of $X$ together with the set $Hom_{\Pi_1(X)}(x,y)$ for all points of points
and equipped with this composition operation is called the _[[fundamental groupoid]]_ of $X$, denoted

$$
  \Pi_1(X)

If we pick a single point $x \in X$, then one writes

$$
  \pi_1(X,x)

1. The constant loop is a [[neutral element]] under this composition (thus making $\pi_1(X,x)$ a "[[monoid]]").

1. The  reverse of a loop is its [[inverse]] in $\pi_1(X,x)$, making $\pi_1(X,x)$ indeed into a [[group]].

This is called the _[[fundamental group]]_ of $X$ at $x$.

###### Proposition

Let $X,Y \in Top^{\ast/}$ be [[pointed topological space]] and let $f_1, f_2 \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
be two base-point preserving continuous functions. If there is a homotopy 

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; f_1 \Rightarrow f_2

then the induced [[homomorphisms]] on fundamental groups agree

$$
  (f_1)_\ast = (f_2)_\ast \;\colon\; \pi_1(X,x) \to \pi_1(Y,y)

$$

In particular if $f \;\colon; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[homotopy equivalence]] then 
$f_\ast \;\colon\; \pi_1(X,x) \to \pi_1(Y,y)$ is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Proof

This follows by the fact that homotopy respects composition (prop. \ref{EquivRelHomotopy}):

If $\gamma \;\colon\; [0,1] \longrightarrow X$ is a closed path representing a given element of
$\pi_1(X,x)$, then the homotopy $f_1 \Rightarrow f_2$ induces a homotopy

$$
  f_1 \circ \gamma \Rightarrow f_2 \circ \gamma
$$

and therefore these represent the same elements in $\pi_1(Y,y)$.

If follows that if $f$ is a homotopy equivalence with homotopy inverse $g$, then 
$g_\ast \colon \pi_1(Y,y) \to \pi_1(X,x)$ is an [[inverse morphism]] to  $f_\ast \colon \pi_1(X,x) \to \pi_1(Y,y)$
and hence $f_\ast$ is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Definition
**([[covering space]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].
A _[[covering space]]_ of $X$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  p \colon E \longrightarrow X
$$

such that there exists an [[open cover]] $\underset{i}{\sqcup}U_i \to X$, such that restricted
to each $U_i$ then $E \to X$ is [[homeomorphic]] over $U_i$
to the [[product topological space]] ([this example](Introduction+to+Topology+--+1#ProductTopologicalSpace)) of $U_i$
with the [[discrete topological space]] ([this example](Introduction+to#topology+--+1#CoDiscreteTopology)) on a [[set]] $F_i$,

In summary this says that $p \colon E \to X$ is a covering space if there exists a [[pullback]] [[diagram]] in [[Top]]
of the form

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \times Disc(F_i) &\longrightarrow&  E
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

For $x \in U_i \subset X$ a point, then the elements in $F_x  = F_i$ are called the _[[leaves]]_ of the covering at $x$.

Given two covering spaces $p_i \colon E_i \to X$ , then a [[homomorphism]] between them is
a [[continuous function]] $f \colon E_1 \to E_2$ between the total covering spaces, which respects
the [[fibers]] in that the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]

$$
  \array{
    E_1 && \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} && E_2
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

This defines a [[category]] $Cov(X)$ whose

* [[objects]] are the covering spaces over $X$;

* [[morphisms]] are the homomorphisms between these.

Then for $x \in X$ any point, and any choice of element $e \in F_x$ of the [[leaf space]] over $x$,
there is, up to [[homotopy]], a unique way to lift a representative
path in $X$ of an element $\gamma$ of the the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$ (def. \ref{FundamentalGroup}) to a
continuous path in $E$ that starts at $e$. This path necessarily ends at some (other) point $\rho_\gamma(e) \in F_x$
in the same [[fiber]]. This construction provides a [[function]]

$$

###### Proposition
**(covering projections are [[open maps]])**

If $p \colon E \to X$ is a covering space projection, then $p$ is an [[open map]].


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of covering space there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ and [[homeomorphisms]] $p^{-1}(U_i) \simeq U_i \times Disc(F_i)$ for all $i \in I$. Since the [[projections]] out of a [[product topological space]] are [[open maps]] ([this prop.](product+topological+space#ProjectionsAreOpenMaps)), it follows that $p$ is an open map when restricted to any of the $p^{-1}(U_i)$. But a general open subset $W \subset E$ is the union of its restrictions to these subspaces:

$$
  W = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} (W \cap p^{-1}(U_i))
  \,.
$$

Since images preserve unions ([this prop.](interactions+of+images+and+pre-images+with+unions+and+intersections#PreservationOfUnionsAndIntersectionsOfSets)) it follows that

$$
  p(W) = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} p(W \cap p^{-1}(U_i))
$$

is a union of open sets, and hence itself open.

###### Lemma
**(path lifting property)**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be any [[covering space]].  Given

1. $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ a [[path]] in $X$,

1. $\hat x_0 \in E$ be a lift of its starting point, hence such that $p(\hat x_0) = \gamma(0)$

then there exists a unique path $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to E$ such that

1. it is a lift of the original path: $p \circ \hat \gamma = \gamma$;

1. it starts at the given lifted point: $\hat \gamma(0) = \hat x_0$.

In other words, every [[commuting diagram]] in [[Top]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

has a unique [[lift]]:

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\hat \gamma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
####### Proof

First consider the case that the covering space is trival, hence of the [[Cartesian product]] form

$$
  pr_1 \;\colon\;  X \times Disc(S) \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[product topological spaces]]
in this case a lift $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to X \times Disc(S)$ is equivalently a [[pair]] of continuous functions

$$
  pr_1(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to X  \phantom{AAAA} pr_2(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to Disc(S)
  \,,
$$

Now the lifting condition explicitly fixes $pr_1(\hat \gamma) = \gamma$. nMoreover, a continuous function into a [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$ is [[locally constant function|locally constant]], and since $[0,1]$ is a [[connected topological space]] this means that $pr_2(\hat \gamma)$ is in fact a [[constant function]] ([this example](connected+space#LocallyConstantFunctionsOnConnectedSpaces)), hence uniquely fixed to be $pr_2(\hat \gamma) = \hat x_0$.

This shows the statement for the case of trivial covering spaces.

Now consider any covering space $p \colon E \to X$. By definition of covering spaces, there exists for every point $x \in X$ a [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ such that the restriction of $E$ to $U_x$ becomes a trivial covering space:

$$
  p^{-1}(U_x) \simeq U_x \times Disc(p^{-1}(x))
  \,.
$$

Consider such a choice

$$
  \{U_x \subset X\}_{x \in X}
  \,.
$$

This is an [[open cover]] of $X$. Accordingly, the [[pre-images]]

$$
  \left\{
    \gamma^{-1}(U_x)
    \subset
    [0,1]
  \right\}_{x \in X}
$$

constitute an open cover of the [[topological interval]] $[0,1]$.

Now $[0,1]$ is a [[sequentially compact topological space|compact]] [[metric space]] and therefore the [[Lebesgue number lemma]] implies that there is a [[positive number]] $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ and cover of $[0,1]$ by [[open intervals]] of the form $(-\epsilon + x , x  + \epsilon) \cap [0,1] \subset [0,1]$ which [[refinement|refines]] this cover. Again since $[0,1]$ is a [[compact topological space]] there is a [[finite set]] of such intervals which covers $[0,1]$. This means that we find a [[finite number]] of points

$$
  t_0 \lt t_1 \lt \cdots \lt_{n+1} \in [0,1]
$$

with $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{n+1} = 1$ such that for all $0 \lt j \leg n$ there is $x_j \in X$ such that the corresponding path segment

$$
  \gamma([t_j, t_{j+1}]) \subset X
$$

is contained in $U_{x_j}$ from above.

Now assume that $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_j]}$ has been found. Then by the triviality of the covering space over $U_{x_j}$ and the first argument above, there is a unique lift of $\gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ to a continuous function $\hat \gamma|_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ with starting point $\hat \gamma(t_j)$. Since $[0,t_{j+1}]$ is the [[pushout]] $[0,t_j] \underset{\{t_j\}}{\sqcup} [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ ([this example](Top#TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself)), it follows that $\hat \gamma|_{[0,t_j]}$ and $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ uniquely glue to a continuous function $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$ which lifts $\gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$.

By [[induction]] over $j$, this yields the required lift $\hat \gamma$.

Conversely, given any lift, $\hat \gamma$, then its restrictions $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ are uniquely fixed by the above inductive argument. Therefore also the total lift is unique.

###### Proposition
**([[homotopy lifting property]] of [[covering spaces]])**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be a [[covering space]]. Then given a [[homotopy]] relative the starting point between two [[paths]] in $X$, there is for every lift of these two paths to paths in $E$ with the same starting point a unique homotopy between the lifted paths that lifts the given homotopy:

  }
$$

there is a unique diagonal [[lift]] in the lower diagram, as shown.

Moreover if the homotopy $\eta$ also fixes the endpoint, then so does the lifted homotopy $\hat \eta$.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is analogous to that of lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}: The [[Lebesgue number lemma]] gives a partition of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ into a [[finite number]] of squares such that the image of each under $\gamma$ lands in an open subset over which the covering space trivializes. Then there is [[induction|inductively]] a unique appropriate lift over each of these squares.

Finally, if the homotopy in $X$ is constant also at the endpoint, hence on $\{1\} \times [0,1]$, then the function constant on $\hat \eta(1,1)$ is clearly a lift of the path $eta\vert_{\{1\}\times [0,1]}$ and by uniqueness of the path lifting (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) this means that also $\hat \eta$ is constant on $\{1\} \times [0,1]$.

Then for $\ell_Y$ a [[path]] in $(Y,y)$ that happens to be a [[loop]], every lift of its image path $f \circ \ell$ in $(X,x)$ to a path $\widehat{f\circ \ell_Y}$ in $(E,e)$ is also a loop there.

###### Proof

By assumption, there is a loop $\ell_E$ in $(E,e)$ and a homotopy fixing the endpoints of the form

$$
  \eta_{X} \;\colon\; p \circ \ell_E \Rightarrow f\circ \ell_Y
  \,.
$$

Then by the homotopy lifting property (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting}), there is a homotopy in $(E,e)$ fixing the starting point, of the form

$$
  \eta_{E} \;\colon\; \ell_E \Rightarrow \widehat{f \circ \ell_Y}
$$

and lifting the homotopy $\eta_X$. Since $\eta_X$ in addition fixes the endpoint, the uniqueness of the path lifting (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) implies that also $\eta_{E}$ fixes the endpoint. Therefore $\eta_E$ is in fact a homotopy between loops, and so $\weidehat{f \circ \ell_Y}$ is indeed a loop.

Since $Y$ is connected and locally path-connected, it is also a [[path-connected topological space]] ([this prop.](locally+path-connected+space#ForLocallyPathConnectedTheConnectedComponentsCoincideWithThePathConnectedComponents)). Hence for every point $y' \in Y$ there exists a [[path]] $\gamma$ connecting $y$ with $y'$ and hence a path $f \circ \gamma$ connecting $x$ with $f(y')$.  By the path-lifting property (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) this has a unique lift

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{e}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\widehat{f \circ \gamma}}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1]
     &\underset{f \circ \gamma}{\longrightarrow}&
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore

$$
  \hat f(y') \coloneqq \widehat{f \circ \gamma}
$$

if a lift of $f(y')$.

We claim now that this pointwise construction is independent of the choice $\gamma$, and that as a function of $y'$ it is indeed continuous. This will prove the claim.

Now by the path lifting lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting} the lift $\widehat{\f \circ \gamma}$ is unique given $f \circ \gamma$, and hence $\hat f(y')$ depends at most on the choice of $\gamma$.

Hence let $\gamma' \colon [0,1] \to Y$ be another path in $Y$ that connects $y$ with $y'$. We need to show that then $\widehat{f \circ \gamma'} = \widehat{f \circ \gamma}$.

First observe that if $\gamma'$ is related to $\gamma$ by a [[homotopy]], so that then also $f \circ \gamma'$ is related to $f \circ \gamma$ by a homotopy, then this is the statement of the homotopy lifting property of lemma \ref{CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting}.

Next write $\bar\gamma'\cdot \gamma$ for the [[path concatenation]] of the path $\gamma$ with the [[reverse path]] of the path $\gamma'$, hence a loop in $Y$, so that $f \circ (\bar\gamma'\cdot \gamma)$ is a loop in $X$. The assumption that $f_\ast(\pi_1(Y,y)) \subset p_\ast(\pi_1(E,e))$ implies (example \ref{IfFundamentalGroupsIncludeThenfLoopsLiftToLoops}) that the path $\widehat{f \circ (\bar \gamma' \cdot \gamma)}$ which lifts this loop to $E$ is itself a loop in $E$.

By uniqueness of path lifting, this means that the lift of $f \circ ( \gamma' \cdot (\bar\gamma' \cdot \gamma) )$ coincides with that of $f \circ \gamma'$. But $\bar \gamma' \cdot (\gamma' \cdot \gamma)$ is homotopic (via reparameterization) to just $\gamma$. Hence it follows now with the first statement that the lift of $f \circ \gamma'$ indeed coincides with that of $f \circ \gamma$.

This shows that the above prescription for $\hat f$ is well defined.

It only remains to show that the function $\hat f$ obtained this way is continuous.

Let $y' \in Y$ be a point and $W_{\hat f(y')} \subset E$ an open neighbourhood of its image in $E$. It is sufficient to see that there is an open neighbourhood $V_{y'} \subset Y$ such that $\hat f(V_y) \subset W_{\hat f(y')}$.

Let $U_{f(y')} \subset X$ be an open neighbourhood over which $p$ trivializes. Then the restriction

$$
  p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
    \;\subset\;
  U_{f(y')} \times Disc(p^{-1}(f(y')))
$$

is an open subset of the product space. Consider its further restriction

$$
  \left( U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\} \right)
    \cap
  \left(
    p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
  \right)
$$

to the [[leaf]]

$$
  U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\} \;\subset\; U_{f(y')} \times p^{-1}(f(y'))
$$

which is itself an open subset. Since $p$ is an [[open map]] ([this prop.](covering+space#CoveringProjectionsAreOpenMaps)), the subset

$$
  p\left(
    \left(
      U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}
    \right)
      \cap
    \left(
      p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
    \right)
  \right)
  \subset X
$$

is open, hence so is its pre-image

$$
  f^{-1}
  \left(
    p
      \left(
        \left(
          U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}
        \right)
          \cap
        \left(
          p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
        \right)
    \right)
  \right)
    \;\subset\;
  Y
  \,.
$$


Since $Y$ is assumed to be [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]], there exists a path-connected open neighbourhood

$$
  V_{y'}
    \subset
  f^{-1}\left(p\left(
    \left(U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}\right)
      \cap
    \left(
      p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
    \right)
  \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

By the uniqueness of pah lifting, the image of that under $\hat f$ is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat f(V_{y_'})
    & =
    f(V_{y'}) \times \{\hat f(y')\}
    \\
     & \subset
    p\left(
      \left(U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\}\right)
        \cap
      \left(
        p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
      \right)
    \right) \times \{\hat f(y')\}
    \\
    & \simeq
      \left( U_{f(y')} \times \{\hat f(y')\} \right)
        \cap
      \left(
        p^{-1}(U_{f(y')}) \cap W_{\hat f(y')}
      \right)
     \\
     & \subset W_{\hat f(y')}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

It remains to show that this lift is unique if $Y$ is path-connected. (...)

### Monodromy

+-- {: .num_defn #CoveringSpaceMonodromy}
###### Definition
**([[monodromy]] of a covering space)

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $E \overset{p}{\to} X$ a [[covering space]]. Write $\Pi_1(X)$ for the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$.

Define a [[functor]]

$$
  Fib_E
    \;\colon\;
  \Pi_1(X)
    \longrightarrow
  Set
$$

to the [[category]] [[Set]] of [[sets]] as follows:

1. to a point $x \in X$ assign the [[fiber]] $p^{-1}(\{x\}) \in Set$;

1. to the [[homotopy class]] of a [[path]] $\gamma$ connecting $x \coloneqq \gamma(0)$ with $y \coloneqq \gamma(1)$ in $X$ assign the function $p^{-1}(\{x\}) \longrightarrow p^{-1}(\{y\})$ which takes $\hat x \in p^{-1}(\{x\})$ to the endpoint of a path $\hat \gamma$ in $E$ which lifts $\gamma$ through $p$ with starting point $\hat \gamma(0) = \hat x$

   $$
     \array{
       p^{-1}(x) &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& p^{-1}(y)
       \\
       (\hat x = \hat \gamma(0)) &\mapsto& \hat \gamma(1)
     }
     \,.
   $$

This construction is well defined for a given representative $\gamma$ due to the unique path-lifting property of covering spaces ([this lemma](covering+space#CoveringSpacePathLifting)) and it is independent of the choice of $\gamma$ in the given homotopy class of paths due to the homotopy-lifting property ([this lemma](covering+space#CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting)).  Similarly, these two lifting properties give that this construction respects composition in $\Pi_1(X)$ and hence is indeed a [[functor]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given a [[homomorphism]] between two [[covering spaces]] $E_i \overset{p_i}{\to} X$, hence a [[continuous function]] $f \colon E_1 \to E_2$ which respects [[fibers]] in that the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    E_1 && \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} && E_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commutes]], then the component functions

$$
  f\vert_{\{x\}} \;\colon\; p_1^{-1}(\{x\}) \longrightarrow p_2^{-1}(\{x\})
$$

are compatible with the monodromy $Fib_{E}$ (def. \ref{CoveringSpaceMonodromy}) along any [[path]] $\gamma$ between points $x$ and $y$ from def. \ref{CoveringSpaceMonodromy} in that the following [[diagrams]] of [[sets]] [[commuting diagram|commute]]

$$
  \array{
     p_1^{-1}(x) &\overset{f\vert_{\{x\}}}{\longrightarrow}& p_2^{-1}(x)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{Fib_{E_1}([\gamma])}}\downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ Fib_{E_2}([\gamma]) }}
     \\
     p_1^{-1}(y) &\underset{f\vert_{\{y\}}}{\longrightarrow}& p_2^{-1}(\{y\})
  }
  \,.
$$

This means that $f$ induces a [[natural transformation]] between the monodromy functors of $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively, and hence that constructing monodromy is itself a functor from the [[category]] of [[covering spaces]] of $X$ to that of [[permutation representations]] of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$:

### Reconstruction

The following is a description of the reconstruction in terms of elementary [[point-set topology]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ElementaryReconstructionCoveringSpace}
###### Definition
**([[reconstruction of covering spaces from monodromy]])**

Let

1. $(X,\tau)$ be a [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] [[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]] [[topological space]],

1. $\rho \in Set^{\Pi_1(X)}$ a [[permutation representation]] of its [[fundamental groupoid]].

Consider the [[disjoint union]] [[set]] of all the sets appearing in this representation

$$
  E(\rho) \;\coloneqq\;  \underset{x \in X}{\sqcup} \rho(x)
$$

For an [[open subset]] $U \subset X$ which is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]] and for which every element of the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(U,x)$ becomes trivial under $\pi_1(U,x) \to \pi_1(X,x)$, and for $\hat x \in \rho(x)$ with $x \in U$ consider the subset

$$
  V_{U,\hat x}
    \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \rho(\gamma)(\hat x)
    \;\vert\;
    x' \in U
    \,,\phantom{A}
    \gamma \,\text{path from}\, x \,\text{to}\, x'
  \right\}
  \;\subset\;
  E(\rho)
  \,.
$$

The collection of these defines a [[base for a topology]] (prop. \ref{ElementaryReconstructedCoveringSpaceWellDefined} below). Write $\tau_{\rho}$ for the corresponding topology. Then

$$
  (E(\rho), \tau_{\rho})
$$

is a [[topological space]]. It canonically comes with the function

$$
  \array{
    E(\rho) &\overset{p}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \hat x \in \rho(x) &\mapsto& x
  }
  \,.
$$

Finally, for

$$
  f \;\colon\; \rho_1 \longrightarrow \rho_2
$$

a [[homomorphism]] of permutation representations, there is the evident induced function

$$
  \array{
    E(\rho_1)
     &\overset{Rec(f)}{\longrightarrow}&
    E(\rho_2)
    \\

  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ElementaryReconstructedCoveringSpaceWellDefined}
###### Proposition

The construction $\rho \mapsto E(\rho)$ in def. \ref{ElementaryReconstructionCoveringSpace}
is well defined and yields a [[covering space]] of $X$.

Moreover, the construction $f \mapsto Rec(f)$ yields a homomorphism of covering spaces.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that we indeed have a [[topological space|topology]], we need to check  (by [this prop.](topological+base#Recognition)) that every point is contained in some base element, and that every point in the intersection of two base elements has a base neighbourhood that is still contained in that intersection.

So let $x \in X$ be a point. By the assumption that $X$ is [[semi-locally simply connected]] there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ such that every loop in $U_x$ on $x$ is contractible in $X$. Moreover by the assumption that $X$ is [[locally path-connected topological space]], this contains a possibly smaller open neighbourhood $U'_x \subset U_x$ which is [[path-connected topological space|path connected]]. Moreover, as every subset of $U_x$, it still has the property that every loop in $U'_x$ based on $x$ is contractible as a loop in $X$. Now let $\hat x \in E$ be any point over $x$, then it is contained in the base open $V_{U'_x,x}$.

The argument for the base open neighbourhoods contained in intersections is similar.


Then we need to see that $p \colon E(\rho) \to X$ is a [[continuous function]]. Since taking pre-images preserves unions ([this prop.](interactions+of+images+and+pre-images+with+unions+and+intersections#PreImagePreservesUnionsAndIntersections)), and since by semi-local simply connectedness every neighbourhood contains an open $U \subset X$ that labels a base open, it is sufficient to see that $p^{-1}(U)$ is a base open. But by the very assumption on $U$, there is a unique morphism in $\Pi_1(X)$ from any point $x \in U$ to any other point in $U$, so that $\rho$ applied to these paths establishes a bijection of sets

$$
  p^{-1}(U)
    \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\hat x \in \rho(x)}{\sqcup} V_{U,\hat x}
    \;\simeq\;
  U \times \rho(x)
  \,,
$$

thus exhibiting $p^{-1}(U)$ as a union of base opens.

Finally we need to see that this continuous function $p$ is a covering projection, hence that every point $x \in X$ has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $p^{-1}(U) \simeq U \times \rho(x)$. But this is again the case for those $U$ all whose loops are contractible in $X$, by the above identification via $\rho$, and these exist around every point by semi-local simply-connetedness of $X$.

This shows that $p \colon E(\rho) \to X$ is a covering space. It remains to see that $Ref(f) \colon E(\rho_1) \to E(\rho_2)$ is a homomorphism of covering spaces. Now by construction it is immediate that this is a function over $X$, in that this [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    E(\rho_1) && \overset{Rec(f)}{\longrightarrow}&& E(\rho_2)
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

So it only remains to see that $Ref(f)$ is a [[continuous function]]. So consider $V_{U, y_2 \in \rho_2(x)}$ a base open of $E(\rho_2)$. By [[natural transformation|naturality]] of $f$ its pre-image under $Rec(f)$ is

$$
  Rec(f)^{-1}(V_{U, y_2 \in \rho_2(x)})
  =
  \underset{y_1 \in f^{-1}(y_2)}{\sqcup} V_{U,y_1}
$$

and hence a union of base opens.

### Fundamental theorem of covering spaces

+-- {: .num_theorem #FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}
###### Theorem
**([[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply-connected topological space]]. Then the operations on

1. extracting the [[monodromy]] $Fib_{E}$ of a [[covering space]] $E$ over $X$

1. [[reconstructing a covering space from monodromy]] $Rec(\rho)$

constitute an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Cov(X)
    \underoverset
      {\underset{Fib}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{Rec}{\longleftarrow}}
      {}
  Set^{\Pi_1(X)}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given $\rho \in Set^{\Pi_1(X)}$ a [[permutation representation]],
we need to exhibit a [[natural isomorphism]] of permutation representations.

$$
  \eta_{\rho}
    \;\colon\;
  \rho \longrightarrow Fib(Rec(\rho))
$$

First consider what the right hand side is like:
By [this def.](reconstruction+of+covering+spaces+from+monodromy#ElementaryReconstructionCoveringSpace) of $Rec$ and [this def.](monodromy#CoveringSpaceMonodromy) of $Fib$ we have for every $x \in X$ an actual equality

$$
  Fib(Rec(\rho))(x) = \rho(x)
  \,.
$$

To similarly understand the value of $Fib(Rec(\rho))$ on morphisms $[\gamma] \in \Pi_1(X)$, let $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ be a representing [[path]] in $X$. We find, by the [[Lebesgue number lemma]] as in the proof of [this lemma](covering space#CoveringSpacePathLifting), a [[finite number]] of paths $\{\gamma_i\}_{i \in \{1,n\}}$ such that

1. regarded as morphisms $[\gamma_i]$ in $\Pi_1(X)$ they [[composition|compose]] to $[\gamma]$:

   $$
     [\gamma] = [\gamma_n] \circ \cdots \circ [\gamma_2] \circ [\gamma_1]
   $$

1. each $\gamma_i$ factors through an open subset $U_i \subset X$ over which $Rec(\rho)$ trivializes.

Hence by [[functor|functoriality]] of $Fib(Rec(\rho))$ it is sufficient to understand its value on these paths $\gamma_i$. But on these we have again by direct unwinding of the definitions that

$$
  Fib(Rec(\rho))([\gamma_i]) = \rho([\gamma_i])
  \,.
$$

This means that if we take

$$
  \eta_\rho(x) \colon \rho(x) \overset{=}{\longrightarrow} Fib(Rec(\rho))
$$

to be the above identification, then this is a [[natural transformation]] and hence in a particular a natural isomorphism, as required.

Conversely, given $E \in Cov(X)$ a covering space, we need to exhibit a natural isomorphism of covering spaces of the form

$$
  \epsilon_E
    \;\colon\;
  Rec(Fib(E)) \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

Again by [this def.](reconstruction+of+covering+spaces+from+monodromy#ElementaryReconstructionCoveringSpace) of $Rec$ and [this def.](monodromy#CoveringSpaceMonodromy) of $Fib$  the underlying set of $Rec(Fib(E))$ is actually equal to that of $E$, hence it is sufficient to check that this [[identity function]] on underlying sets is a [[homeomorphism]] of [[topological spaces]].

By the assumption that $X$ is [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]], it is sufficient to check for $U\subset X$ an open path-connected subset and $x \in X$ a point with the property that $\pi_1(U,x) \to \pi_1(X,x)$ lands is constant on the trivial element, that the open subsets of $E$ of the form $U \times \{\hat x\} \subset p^{-1}(U)$ form a basis for the topology of $Rec(Fib(E))$. But this is the case by definition of $Rec$.

This proves the equivalence.

(Notice that the assumption of local path-connectedness and semi-local simply-connectedness of $X$ is used only to guarantee that the functor $Rec$ exists in the first place.)

### Applications

###### Proposition
**([[fundamental group of the circle is the integers]])**

The [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1$ of the [[circle]] $S^1$ is the additive group of [[integers]]:


$$
  \pi_1(S^1) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z}
$$

and the isomorphism is given by assigning [[winding number]].

=--

Here in the context of [[topological homotopy theory]] the [[circle]] $S^1$ is the [[topological subspace]] $S^1 = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \,\vert\, x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 1 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ of the [[Euclidean plane]] with its [[metric topology]], or any [[topological space]] of the same [[homotopy type]]. More generally, the circle in question is, as a [[homotopy type]], the [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  S^1 \simeq \ast \underset{\ast \sqcup \ast}{\coprod} \ast
  \,,
$$

hence the [[homotopy type]] with the [[universal property]] that it makes a homotopy commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    \ast \sqcup \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

###### Proof

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/UniversalCoveringOfCircle.png" width="150">
</div>

The [[universal covering space]] $\widehat{S^1}$ of $S^1$ is the [[real line]] (by [this example](universal+covering+space#UniversalCoveringOfCircleRealLine)):

$$
  p \coloneqq (cos(2 \pi(-)), \sin(2 \pi(-)))
   \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \longrightarrow S^1
  \,.
$$

Since the [[circle]] is [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] ([this example](locally+path-connected+space#LocallyPathConnectedCircle)) and [[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]] ([this example](semi-locally+simply+connected+topological+space#LocallySimplyConnectedCircle)) the [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]] applies and gives that the [[automorphism group]] of $\mathbb{R}^1$ over $S^1$ equals the automorphism group of its [[monodromy]] [[permutation representation]]:

$$
  Aut_{Cov(S^1)}(\mathbb{R}^1)
    \;\simeq\;
  Aut_{\pi_1(S^1) Set}(Fib_{S^1})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, as a corollary of the [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]] we have that the [[monodromy]] representation of a [[universal covering space]] is given by the [[action]] of the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(S)$ on itself ([this prop.](universal+covering+space#ReconstructCoveringForFreeAndTransitiveMonodromyRepresentation)).

But the [[automorphism group]] of any group regarded as an [[action]] on itself by left multiplication is canonically isomorphic to that group itself (by [this example](permutation+representation#AutomorphismsOfGAsGTorsor)), hence we have

$$
  Aut_{{\pi_1(S^1)} Set}(Fib_{S^1})
   \;\simeq\;
  Aut_{{\pi_1(S^1)} Set}( \pi_1(S^1) )
   \;\simeq\;
  \pi_1(S^1)
  \,.
$$

Therefore to conclude the proof it is now sufficient to show that

$$
  \mathrm{Aut}_{Cov(S^1)}(\mathbb{R}^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

To that end, consider a [[homeomorphism]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^1 && \underoverset{\simeq}{f}{\longrightarrow} && \mathbb{R}^1
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

Let $s \in S^1$ be any point, and consider the restriction of $f$ to the fibers over the [[complement]]:

$$
  \array{
    p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{s\}) && \underoverset{\simeq}{f}{\longrightarrow} && p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{s\})
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && S^1 \setminus \{s\}
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[covering space]] property we have (via [this example](universal+covering+space#UniversalCoveringOfCircleRealLine)) a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{s\})
   \simeq
  (0,1) \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

Therefore, up to homeomorphism,  the restricted function is of the form

$$
  \array{
    (0,1)\times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
      &&
      \underoverset{\simeq}{f}{\longrightarrow}
      &&
    (0,1) \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
    \\
    & {}_{pr_1}\searrow && \swarrow_{pr_1}
    \\
    && (0,1)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[product topological space]] this means that $f$ is equivalently given by its two components

$$
  (0,1) \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
    \overset{pr_1 \circ f}{\longrightarrow}
  (0,1)
  \phantom{AAAA}
  (0,1) \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
    \overset{pr_2 \circ f}{\longrightarrow}
  Disc(\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

By the [[commuting diagram|commutativity]] of the above [[diagram]], the first component is fixed to be $pr_1$. Moreover, by the fact that $Disc(\mathbb{Z})$ is a [[discrete space]] it follows that the second component is a [[locally constant function]] (by [this example](locally+constant+function#LocallyConstantFunctionIntoDiscreteSpace)). Therefore, since the [[product space]] with a [[discrete space]] is a [[disjoint union space]]  (via [this example](product+topological+space#ProductWithDiscreteFiniteTopologicalSpace))

$$
  (0,1) \times Disc(\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \underset{n \in \mathbb{Z}}{\sqcup}(0,1)
$$

and since the disjoint summands $(0,1)$ are [[connected topological spaces]] ([this example](connected+space#ConnectedSubspacesOfRealLineAreTheIntervals)), it follows that the second component is a [[constant function]] on each  of these summands (by [this example](connected+space#LocallyConstantFunctionsOnConnectedSpaces)).

Finally, since every function out of a [[discrete topological space]] is continuous, it follows in conclusion that the restriction of $f$ to the fibers over $S^1 \setminus \{s\}$ is entirely encoded in an [[endofunction]] of the set of [[integers]]

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

by

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \setminus \{s\} \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
      &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^1 \setminus \{s\} \times Disc(\mathbb{Z})
    \\
    (t,k) &\mapsto& (t, \phi(k))
  }
  \,.
$$


Now let $s' \in S^1$ be another point, distinct from $s$. The same analysis as above applies now to the restriction of $f$ to $S^1 \setminus \{s'\}$ and yields a function

$$
  \phi' \;\colon\; \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$


Since

$$
  \left\{
    p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{s\})
    \subset \mathbb{R}^1
     \,,\,
    p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{s'\})
    \subset \mathbb{R}^1
  \right\}
$$

is an [[open cover]] of $\mathbb{R}^1$, it follows that $f$ is unqiuely fixed by its restrictions to these two subsets.

Now unwinding the definition of $p$ shows that the condition that the two restrictions coincide on the intersection $S^1 \setminus \{s,s'\}$ implies that there is $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\phi(k) = k+ n$ and $\phi'(k) = k+n$.

This shows that $Aut_{Cov(S^1)}(\mathbb{R}^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$.
