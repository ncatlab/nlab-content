## Idea

The _quaternionic Hopf fibration_ is the [[fibration]]


$$
  \array{
     S^3 &\hookrightarrow& S^7
     \\
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_{\mathbb{H}}}}
     \\
     && S^4
  }
$$

of the [[7-sphere]] over the [[4-sphere]] with [[fiber]] the [[3-sphere]], which is induced via the [[Hopf construction]] from the product operation 

$$
  \mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H} \stackrel{(-)\cdot (-)^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{H}
$$

on the [[quaternions]]. This means that if $S^7$ is regarded as the unit sphere $\{(x,y)  | {\vert x\vert}^2 + {\vert y\vert}^2 = 1\}$ in $\mathbb{H}\times \mathbb{H}$ and $S^4$ is regarded as the quaternionic [[projective space]], then $p$ is given simply by

$$
  p \colon (x,y) \mapsto [x;y] = [x/y; 1]
  \,,
$$


## Properties

### Equivariant structure

### Class in the homotopy groups of spheres

The quaternionic Hopf fibration gives an element in the 7th [[homotopy group of sphere|homotopy group of the 4-sphere]]

$$
  [p_{\mathbb{H}}] \in \pi_7(S^4) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
$$

and in fact it is a generator in this group.

Stably, i.e. as a generator for the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] in degree $7-4 = 3$, the quaternionic Hopf map becomes a [[torsion subgroup|torsion]] generator

$$
  [p_{\mathbb{H}}] \in \pi_3^S \simeq \mathbb{Z}/24
  \,,.
$$
