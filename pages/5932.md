## Definition

A morphism $f:Y\to X$ is __finitely presented at__ $x\in X$ if there is an affine open neighborhood $U\ni x$ and an affine open set $V\subset Y$, $f(V)\subset U$ such that
$\mathcal{O}_Y(V)$ is finitely generated as $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$-module. A morphism $f:Y\to X$ is __locally finitely presented__ if it is finitely presented at each $x\in X$. It is __finitely presented__ if it is locally finitely presented, quasicompact and quasiseparated.  

Morphism is __essentially finitely presented__ if it is a localization of a finitely presented morphism.
