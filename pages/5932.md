## Definition

A [[homomorphism]] of [[schemes]] $f \colon Y\to X$ is 

1. __finitely presented at__ $x\in X$ if there is an affine 
[[open neighborhood]] $U\ni x$ and an affine open set $V\subset Y$, $f(V)\subset U$ such that $\mathcal{O}_Y(V)$ is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$-[[module]]. 

1. __locally finitely presented__ if it is finitely presented at each $x\in X$. 

1. __finitely presented__ if it is locally finitely presented, quasicompact and quasiseparated.  

1. __essentially finitely presented__ if it is a localization of a finitely presented morphism.
