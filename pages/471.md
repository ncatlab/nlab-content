## Idea
 
An _interval object_ $I$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[object]] that behaves in $C$ roughly like the unit interval $I := [0,1]$ with its two boundary point inclusions 

$$
  {*}\amalg {*} \stackrel{[0, 1]}{\to}
  I 
$$

in the category [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s, where $[0,1]$ is the [[copairing]] of the [[global elements]] $0\colon {*} \to I$ and $1\colon {*} \to I$.

A bare interval object may be nothing more than such a diagram. If $C$ admits sufficiently many [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, then from this alone a lot of structure derives. The precise definition of further structure and property imposed on an interval object varies with the intended context and applications. 

Notably in a large class of applications the interval object in $C$ supposed to be the right structure to ensure 

1. that there is an object $I$ in $C$ such that for every object $X$ of $C$ the [[internal hom|internal hom object]] $[I,X]$ exists and behaves like a [[path space object]] for $X$;

2. that there is a notion of composition on these path objects which induces on $[I,X]$ a structure of a (higher) category internal to $C$: the [[fundamental category]] or [[fundamental groupoid]] of the object $X$, or rather its [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]].

For instance the choice $C =$ [[Top]] and $I = [0,1]$ 
should be an instance of a category with interval object, and the fundamental [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] [[n-groupoid]] $\Pi_n(X)$ obtained for any topological space $X$ from this data should be the fundamental $n$-groupoid as a [[Trimble n-category]].

We give two very similar definitions that differ only in some extra assumptions. 

* The first one was used by Berger and Moerdijk to generalize the Boardman–Vogt resolution of [[topological operad]]s to more general [[operad]]s. 

* The second is motivated from constructions appearing in the definitions of [[Trimble n-category]] and of [[generalized universal bundle]]. It includes the possibility that the interval is _not_ weakly equivalent to the point, in which case it may be used nontrivially to test for [[undirected object]]s and probe [[directed object]]s.

## Definitions

### Plain definition 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (plain interval object)

A **plain interval object** in a category $C$ is just a [[cospan]] diagram with equal feet

$$
  pt \stackrel{0}{\to} I \stackrel{1}{\leftarrow} pt
$$

in $C$, with $I$ and $pt$ any two objects and $0$ and $1$ any two morphisms.


=--

In categories with finite limits it is often required that $pt=*$ is the terminal object and in this case the interval object is called *cartesian interval object*.

Examples for the use of this notion is at [[fundamental (infinity,1)-category]] in the section "fundamental geometric ∞-categories".

### In homotopical categories

If the ambient category $C$ is a [[homotopical category]],
such as a [[model category]], there are natural 
further conditions to put on an interval object:



#### Trimble interval object
 {#IntervalForTrimbledOmegaeCategories}

The following definition is strongly related to the notion of [[Trimble omega-category]] where the interval object gives the internal hom $[I,X]$ the structure of an [[operad]] giving (by induction) the model of an $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-category|category]] structure on

$$
  (X_0 := [pt,X]) 
  \stackrel{s := [\sigma,X]}{\leftarrow}  
  [I,X] 
  \stackrel{t := [\tau, X]}{\to} (X_0 := [pt,X])
  \,.  
$$

This internal $A_\infty$-category is denoted 

$$
  \Pi_1(X)
$$

This is in (a bit) more detail in [[Trimble omega-category]] and in [[fundamental (infinity,1)-category]] in the section "Fundamental algebraic $\infty$-categories".
 
+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (Trimble interval object)

A **category with interval object** is

* a symmetric [[closed monoidal homotopical category]] $V$;

* with tensor unit being the [[terminal object]], which we write $pt$;

* equipped with a [[bi-pointed object]] 
$$
  \array{
    && I
    \\
    & {}^\sigma \nearrow && \nwarrow^{\tau}
    \\
    pt &&&& pt
  }
$$

in $V$, with $I$ called the **interval object**;

such that

* the [[pushout]]
$$
  \array{
    && I^{\vee 2} := I \amalg_{pt} I
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    I &&&& I
    \\
    & {}_{\tau}\nwarrow
    && \nearrow_{\sigma}
    \\
    && pt
  }
$$
exists in $V$, so that all compositions
$$
  \array{
    && I^{\vee n}
    \\
    & {}^\sigma \nearrow && \nwarrow^{\tau}
    \\
    pt &&&& pt
  }
$$
of $n \in \mathbb{N}$ copies of the [[co-span]] $I$ with itself by pushout over adjacent legs exist in $V$;

* and for all $n$, the $V$-objects of morphisms ${}_{pt}[I, I^{\vee n}]_{pt}$ of cospans (as described at [[co-span]]) are weakly equivalent to the point
 $$ 
   {}_{pt}[I, I^{\vee n}]_{pt}
   \,.
 $$

#### Berger--Moerdijk segment- and interval object 


In [section 4](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0502/0502155v2.pdf#page=11)
of

* Clemens Berger, [[Ieke Moerdijk]], _The Boardman-Vogt resolution of operads in monoidal model categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0502155))

the following definition is given:

Let $V$ be a [[monoidal model category]] and write $pt$ for the tensor unit in $V$ (not necessarily the terminal object). 

A **[[segment object|segment (object)]]** $I$ in a [[monoidal model category]] $V$ is 

* a factorization 

  $$
    pt \amalg pt \stackrel{[0 , 1]}{\to} 
    I \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} pt
  $$

  of the [[codiagonal morphism]]

  $$
    pt \amalg pt \stackrel{[Id , Id]}{\to} pt
  $$ 

  from the [[coproduct]] of $pt$ with itself that 
  sends each component identically to $pt$.

* together with an associative morphsim 

  $$
    \vee : I \otimes I \to I
  $$ 

  which has 0 as its _neutral_ and 1 as 
  its _absorbing_ element, and for which 
  $\epsilon$ is a counit.

If $V$ is equipped with the structure of a [[model category]] then a segment object is an **interval** in $V$ if 

$$
  [0, 1]\colon pt \amalg pt \to I
$$ 

is a cofibration and $\epsilon : I \to pt$ a weak equivalence.



### Interval type
  {#InHomotopyTypeTheory}

In [[homotopy type theory]] the cellular interval can be axiomatized as a [[higher inductive type]]. See _[[interval type]]_ for more.



## Examples

* In [[sSet]] the standard interval object is the 1-[[simplex]] $\Delta[1]$.

* In a [[category of chain complexes]] the standard interval is 
  the [[chain on a simplicial set|simplicial chain complex]] $C_\bullet(\Delta[1])$ on the 1-simplex, see at [[interval object in chain complexes]].

* The [[cube category]] is generated from a single interval object.

* The **standard interval object** in [[Cat]] is the 1st [[oriental]] $\{0\to 1\}$ (see [[co-span co-trace]])

* For $V = C = Top$ with its standard model structure the standard topological closed interval  $I := [0,1]$ with $pt \stackrel{\sigma, \tau}{\to}I$ the maps to 0 and 1, respectively. This is the case described in detail at [[Trimble n-category]].

* For $V = \omega Cat$ the category of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] the first [[oriental]], the 1-[[globe]] $I = \{a \to b\}$ is an interval object. In this strict case in fact all hom objects are already equal to the point ${}_{pt}[I, I^{\vee n}]_{pt} = pt$ and 
$$
  (X = [pt,X]) 
  \stackrel{s := [\sigma,X]}{\leftarrow}  
  [I,X] 
  \stackrel{t := [\tau, X]}{\to} (X = [pt,X])
$$
is a strict co-category internal to $\omega$Cat. 
In this case, for $X$ any $\omega$-category 
the $A_\infty$-category $\Pi_1(X)$ is just an ordinary category, namely the 1-category obtained from truncation of $X$. Similarly, probably $\Pi_\omega(X) = X$ in this case.

### Standard intervals, cubes and simplices in $Top$ and $Diff$ 

Let $X = $ [[Top]] or $C = $ [[Diff]] be the category of [[topological space]]s
or of [[manifold]]s.


A standard choice of interval object in $C$ is $I = [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$
with the obvious two boundary inclusions $0,1 : {*} \to [0,1]$.

But another possible choice is to let $I = \mathbb{R}$ be the whole
real line, but still equipped with the two maps $0,1 : {*} \to \mathbb{R}$,
that hit the $0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $1 \in \mathbb{R}$, respectively.

Either of these two examples will do in the following discussion. 
The second choice is to be thought of as obtained from the first choice
by adding "infinitely wide collars" at both boundaries of $[0,1]$. While
${*} \stackrel{0}{\to}[0,1]
\stackrel{1}{\leftarrow} {*}$ may seem like a more natural choice for a representative of the 
idea of the "standard interval", the choice ${*} \stackrel{0}{\to} \mathbb{R}
\stackrel{1}{\leftarrow} {*}$ is actually more useful for many 
[[category theory|abstract nonsense]] constructions. 

But since it is hard to draw the full real line, in the following we depict the situation for the choice $I = [0,1]$.

Then for low $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the above construction yields this

* $n=0$ -- here $\Delta_I^0 = I^{\times 0} = {*}$ is the [[point]]. 

* $n=1$ -- here $\Delta_I^1 = I^{\times 1} = I$ is just the interval itself

  $$
    \array{
      (0) \to (1)

    }
  $$
  
  The two face maps $\delta_1 {*} \to I$ and $\delta_0 : {*} \to I$ pick
  the boundary points in the obvious way. The unique degeneracy map 
  $\sigma_0 : I \to {*}$ maps all points of the interval to the single point
  of the point. 

* $n=2$ -- here $\Delta_i^2 = I^{\times 2} = I \times I$ 
  is the **standard square**

  $$ 
    \array{
      (0,1) &\to& (1,1)
      \\
      \uparrow && \uparrow
      \\
      (0,0) &\to& (1,0)
    }
  $$

  But the three face maps $\delta_i : I \to I\times I$ of the cosimplicial
  object $\Delta_I$ constructed above don't regard the full square here, but
  just a triangle sitting inside it, in that pictorially they 
  identify $(\Delta_I^1 = I)$-shaped boundaries in $I \times I$ as follows:
  
  $$ 
    \array{
      (0,1) &\to& (1,1)
      \\
      \uparrow &^{= \delta_1(I)}\nearrow& \uparrow^{ = \delta_0(I)}
      \\
      (0,0) &\stackrel{= \delta_2(I)}{\to}& (1,0)
    }
  $$
  
  (here the arrows do not depict morphisms, but the standard topological interval, 
  i don't know how to typeset just lines without arrow heads in this fashion!)
  
* $n=3$ -- here $\Delta_i^3 = I^{\times 3} = I \times I \times I$ 
  is the **standard cube**

  ###### Exercise
  Insert the analog of the above discussion here
  and upload a nice graphics that shows the standard cube and how the
  cosimplicial object $\Delta_I$ picks a solid tetrahedron inside it.
  =--

As a start, we can illustrate how there are 6 3-simplices sitting inside each 3-cube.

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/3simplex_in_3cube.jpg" width = "550"/>

Once you see how the 3-simplices sit inside the 3-cube, the facemaps can be illustrated as follows:

<img src="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/3simplex_facemaps.jpg" width = "550"/>

Note that these face maps are to be thought of as maps into 3-simplices sitting inside a 3-cube.

## Fundamental $\infty$-categories induced from intervals 

The interest in interval objects is that various further structures of interest may be built up from them. In particular, since picking an interval object $I$ is like picking a notion of _path_, in a category with interval object there is, under mild assumptions, for each object $X$ an [[infinity-category]] $\Pi_I(X)$ -- the fundamental $\infty$-category of $X$ with respect to $I$ -- whose [[k-morphism]]s are $k$-fold $I$-paths in $X$.

This is described for two models for $(\infty,1)$-categories at [[fundamental (infinity,1)-category]]


## Homotopy localization induced from an interval 

Given a suitable interval obect in a [[site]] $C$, one may ask for [[∞-stack]]s on $C$ that are invariant under the notion of [[homotopy]] induced by $I$. These are obtained by [[homotopy localization]] of a full [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $C$.
