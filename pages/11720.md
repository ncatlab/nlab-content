## Idea

The term "continuous cohomology" is often used as shorthand for the "naive" version of [[group cohomology]] of [[topological groups]] which uses [[cocycles]] of the form known for [[discrete groups]] and just requires them to be [[continuous functions]]. For "actual" group cohomology of topological groups one needs to in addition perform certain [[resolutions]] before considering continuous cocycles.
