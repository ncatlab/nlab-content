## Idea

A jet can be thought of as the infinitesimal germ of a [[section]] of some [[bundle]] or of a map between spaces. Jets are a coordinate free version of Taylor-polynomials and Taylor series.

## Definition

### Concrete

For $p : P \to X$ a [[surjective submersion]] of [[smooth manifold]]s and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the bundle $J^k P \to X$ of **$k$- order jets of sections of $p$** is the bundle whose [[fiber]] over a point $x \in X$ is the space of equivalence classes of [[germ]]s of [[section]]s of $p$, where two germs are considered equivalent if their first $k$ partial [[derivative]]s at $x$ coincide.

In the case when $p$ is a trivial bundle $p:X\times Y \to X$ its sections are canonically in bijection with maps from $X$ to $Y$ and two sections have the same partial derivatives iff the partial derivatives of the corresponding maps from $X$ to $Y$ agree. So in this case the jet space $J^k P$ is called the space of jets of maps from $X$ to $Y$ and commonly denoted with $J^k(X,Y)$.

### General abstract

We discuss a [[general abstract]] definition of jet bundles.

Let 

* $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] 

* equipped with [[differential cohesion]] 

  $$
    \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{}{\leftarrow}}}} \mathbf{H}_{th}
  $$ 

  with [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Pi_{inf}$

* and equipped with an [[(∞,2)-sheaf]] 

  [[Mod]]  $ \colon \; \mathbf{H}^{op} \to $ [[Stab(∞,1)Cat]] 

  of [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaves]].


For $X \in \mathbf{H}$, write $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ for the corresponding [[de Rham space]] object.

Notice that we have the canonical morphism

$$
  i : X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
$$

("inclusion of constant paths into all infinitesimal paths").

###### Definition


Write 

$$
  Jet 
   \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Jet := i_*}{\to}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)}
$$

for the corresponding [[base change geometric morphism]].

Its [[direct image]] may be called the _jet bundle [[(∞,1)-functor]]_ . Or rather, if one regards the jet bundle again as a bundle over $X$, then the jet construction is the [[(∞,1)-comonad]] $i^\ast i_\ast$.

In the context of [[D-schemes]] this is ([BeilinsonDrinfeld, 2.3.2](#BeilinsonDrinfeld)). The abstract formulation as used here appears in ([Lurie, prop. 0.9](#Lurie)). See also ([Paugam, section 2.3](#Paugam)) for a review.
There this is expressed dually in terms of algebras in [[D-modules]]. We indicate how the translation works

###### Remark

In terms of [[differential homotopy type theory]] this means that
forming "jet types" of [[dependent types]] over $X$ is the 
[[dependent product]] operation along the unit of the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] 

$$
  jet(E) \coloneqq \underset{X \to \Pi_{inf}X}{\prod} E
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaf]] on $X$ is a morphism of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]

$$
  X \to Mod
  \,.
$$

We write

$$
  QC(X) := Hom(X, Mod)
$$

for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaves]].

A _[[D-module]]_ on $X$ is a morphism of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) \to Mod
  \,.
$$

We write 

$$
  DQC(X) := Hom(\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X), Mod)
$$

for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of D-modules.

The **Jet algebra** functor is the [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from [[associative algebra|commutative algebra]]s over $\mathcal{D}(X)$ to those over the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}(X)$

$$
  (Jet \dashv F)
   :
   Alg_{\mathcal{D}(X)}
    \stackrel{\overset{Jet}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
   Alg_{\mathcal{O}(X)}
  \,.
$$


## Application 

Typical [[Lagrangian]]s in [[quantum field theory]] are defined on jet bundles. Their [[variational calculus]] is governed by [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s.
