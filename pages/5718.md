## Idea

A jet can be thought of as the infinitesimal germ of a section of some bundle. Jets are a coordinate free version of Taylor-polynomials and Taylor series.

## Definition

### Concrete

For $p : P \to X$ a [[surjective submersion]] of [[smooth manifold]]s and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the order $k$- **jet bundle** $J^k P \to X$ is the bundle whose [[fiber]] over a point $x \in X$ is the space of equivalence classes of [[germ]]s of [[section]]s of $p$ at $x$ where two germs are considered equivalent if their first $k$ [[derivative]]s coincide.


### The infinite order jet bundle as the cofree $J^1$-coalgebra

Let $J^1$ be the functor on bundles over $X$ sending a bundle $p:P\to X$ to the bundle $J^1 p: J^1 P \to X$ of first order jets of sections of $p$. This functor is co-pointed: the natural projection $J^1 P \to P$ forgets first order information. A $J^1$-[[coalgebra for an endofunctor|coalgebra]] is then by definition a bundle $p:P\to X$ with a bundle map $P\to J^1 P$, which is the same as a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on $P$. Whit this, the infinite order jet bundle of sections of $p$ may be defined as the cofree $ J^1$-coalgebra on $P$. By definition it comes with a bundle map $p_\infty: J^\infty P \to P$ ("forgetting all higher order information") and a universal connection $C: J^\infty P \to J^1( J^\infty P)$ sometimes called the Cartan connection or infinite order contact structure on $J^\infty P$. Its universal property states that for any bundle $q:Q\to X$ with connection $K: Q \to J^1 Q$ and bundle map $\varphi: Q\to P$, there exists a unique prolongation of $\varphi$ denoted with $j^\infty \varphi: Q \to J^\infty P$ commuting with all given maps: $p_\infty \circ j^\infty \varphi =\varphi $ and $J^1(j^\infty \varphi)\circ K= C \circ j^\infty \varphi$. 

In the particular case when $q:Q\to X$ is the identity $X\to X$ with its canonical connection, a morphisms of bundles $\varphi$ from $q$ to $p$ is the same as a section of $p$ and $j^\infty \varphi$ is traditionally called the infinite jet prolongation of the section $\varphi$.

### General abstract

We discuss a [[general abstract]] definition of jet bundles.

Let 

* $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] 

* equipped with [[differential cohesion]] 

  $$
    \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{}{\leftarrow}}}} \mathbf{H}_{th}
  $$ 

  with [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Pi_{inf}$

* and equipped with an [[(∞,2)-sheaf]] 

  [[Mod]]  $ \colon \; \mathbf{H}^{op} \to $ [[Stab(∞,1)Cat]] 

  of [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaves]].


For $X \in \mathbf{H}$, write $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ for the corresponding [[de Rham space]] object.

Notice that we have the canonical morphism

$$
  i : X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)
$$

("inclusion of constant paths into all infinitesimal paths").

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


Write 

$$
  Jet 
   \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Jet := i_*}{\to}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)}
$$

for the corresponding [[base change geometric morphism]].

Its [[direct image]] may be called the _jet bundle [[(∞,1)-functor]]_ . Or rather, if one regards the jet bundle again as a bundle over $X$, then the jet construction is the [[(∞,1)-comonad]] $i^\ast i_\ast$.

In the context of [[D-schemes]] this is ([BeilinsonDrinfeld, 2.3.2](#BeilinsonDrinfeld)). The abstract formulation as used here appears in ([Lurie, prop. 0.9](#Lurie)). See also ([Paugam, section 2.3](#Paugam)) for a review.
There this is expressed dually in terms of algebras in [[D-modules]]. We indicate how the translation works

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In terms of [[differential homotopy type theory]] this means that
forming "jet types" of [[dependent types]] over $X$ is the 
[[dependent product]] operation along the unit of the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] 

$$
  jet(E) \coloneqq \underset{X \to \Pi_{inf}X}{\prod} E
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaf]] on $X$ is a morphism of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]

$$
  X \to Mod
  \,.
$$

We write

$$
  QC(X) := Hom(X, Mod)
$$

for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaves]].

A _[[D-module]]_ on $X$ is a morphism of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]

$$
  \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) \to Mod
  \,.
$$

We write 

$$
  DQC(X) := Hom(\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X), Mod)
$$

for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of D-modules.

The **Jet algebra** functor is the [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from [[associative algebra|commutative algebra]]s over $\mathcal{D}(X)$ to those over the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}(X)$

$$
  (Jet \dashv F)
   :
   Alg_{\mathcal{D}(X)}
    \stackrel{\overset{Jet}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
   Alg_{\mathcal{O}(X)}
  \,.
$$


## Application 

Typical [[Lagrangian]]s in [[quantum field theory]] are defined on jet bundles. Their [[variational calculus]] is governed by [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s.
