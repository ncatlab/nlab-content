## Idea

For $p : P \to X$ a [[surjective submersion]] of [[smooth manifold]]s and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the order $k$- **jet bundle** $J_k P \to X$ is the bundle whose [[fiber]] over a point $x \in X$ is the space of equivalence classes of [[germ]]s of [[section]]s of $p$ where two germs are considered equivalent if their first $k$ [[derivative]]s coincide.

## Application 

Typical [[Lagrangian]]s in [[quantum field theory]] are defined on jet bundles. Their [[variational calculus]] is governed by [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s.

## References

A discussion of jet bundles with an eye towards discussion of the [[variational bicomplex]] on them is in chapter 1, section A of
