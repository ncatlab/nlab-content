## Idea

Given a [[modal operator]] $\bigcirc$, then a [[type]] $X$ may be called _$\bigcirc$-comodal_ or _$\bigcirc$-connected_ (largely now the preferred term) if $\bigcirc X \simeq \ast$ (the [[unit type]]).

Since a type $Y$ is called a _$\bigcirc$-[[modal type]]_ if $\bigcirc Y \simeq Y$, being comodal is in a sense the opposite extreme of being modal.


In as far as [[modal operators]] have [[categorical semantics]] as [[idempotent monads|idempotent (co-)-monads]]/[[idempotent (∞,1)-monads|idempotent (∞,1)-(co-)monads]] anti-modal types are familiar in [[homotopy theory]] as forming [[localizing subcategories]].

## Examples

* for $\bigcirc = n \coloneqq \tau_n$ the [[n-truncation]] modality, then _$n$-comodal_ is indeed _[[n-connected]]_, by [this proposition](n-connected+object+of+an+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#ConnectednessViaTruncationComodalness).

* a comodal type for a [[reduction modality]] or [[infinitesimal shape modality]] is an [[anti-reduced type]], is an [[infinitesimally thickened point]].
