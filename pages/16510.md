## Idea

In a [[cartesian closed category]]/[[type theory]] $\mathcal{C}$, given any [[object]]/[[type]] $W$ there is a [[comonad]]

$$
  W \times (-) \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

given by forming the [[Cartesian product]] with $W$


If here $W$ is equipped with the structure of a [[monoid]], then $W \times (-)$ also canonical inherits the structure of a [[monad]]. In the context of [[monad (in computer science)|monads in computer science]] this is called the _writer monad_. This is the case of interest in [[functional programming]] languages such as [[Haskell]], where a [[program]] for the form $X \longrightarrow W \times Y$ behaves like a program taking input of type $X$ to output of type $Y$ while in addition producing output of type $W$, thought of as a side effect such as "writing to disk".

## Properties

### Relation to reader monad and state monad

In a [[cartesian closed category]]/[[type theory]] $\mathcal{C}$, the writer comonad $W\times (-)$ is [[left adjoint]] to the [[reader monad]] $[W,-]$.

The composite of writer comonad followed by reader monad is the [[state monad]].


### In terms of dependent type theory

If the type system is even a [[locally Cartesian closed category]]/[[dependent type theory]] then for each type $W$ there is the [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}_{/W}
    \stackrel{\overset{\sum_W}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{W^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_W}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathcal{C}
$$

In terms of this then the writer comonad is equivalently the composite

$$
  \sum_W W^\ast = W\times (-) \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

of [[context extension]] followed by [[dependent sum]].

One may also think of this as being the [[integral transform]] through the span

$$
  \ast \leftarrow W \rightarrow \ast
$$

(with trivial kernel) or as the [[polynomial functor]] associated with the span 

$$
  \ast \leftarrow W \stackrel{id}{\rightarrow} W \rightarrow \ast
  \,.
$$
