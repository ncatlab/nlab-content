## Idea

### In physics

In [[physics]] and especially in [[continuum mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]], a physical quantity associated with a [[physical system]] extended in [[space]] is called

* _intensive_ if it is a [[function]] on (the physical system extended in) space;

* _extensive_ if it is a [[density]] or [[linear distribution]] on (the physical system extended in) space.

For instance for a [[solid body]] its [[temperature]] is intensive, but its [[mass]] is extensive: there is a temperature assigned to every point of the body (in the idealization of [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[continuum mechanics]] anyway) but a mass is assigned only to every little "extended" piece of the body, not to a single point.

This terminology in [[physics]] appears vaguely in ([Hegel 1812](#Hegel1812)), [Hegel 1817](#Hegel1817)), more precisely in ([Grassmann 1844](#Grassmann1844)) and in its fully modern form is maybe due to [[Richard Tolman]] ([1917](#Tolman1917)).

If we take into account that a physical system may or may not have a particular kind of quantity (for example, a thermodynamic system may or may not have a temperature), a system has a value of an intensive quantity if and only if all of its subsystems have a value of that quantity, and then all of these values are equal.  However, it's generally safe to assume that every system has a value of every extensive quantity.

To be precise, given a system $S_0$ made up of the subsystems $S_1$ and $S_2$:

*  For an intensive quantity $q$, $S_0$ has a value $q_0$ of $q$ if and only if $S_1$ and $S_2$ also have values of $q$, and then we have $q_1 = q_0$ and $q_2 = q_0$.

*  For an extensive quantity $Q$, all three systems have values of $Q$, and we have $Q_0 = Q_1 + Q_2$.


### In geometry and algebra

In ([Lawvere 86](#Lawvere86)) it is amplified that this [[duality]] is generally a fundamental one also in [[mathematics]]: given a [[topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with a [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[ring object]] $R \in CRing(\mathbf{H})$, then 

* the space of _intensive quantities_ on an [[object]] $X \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[mapping space]] $[X,R]_{\mathbf{H}} \in CRing(\mathbf{H})$ formed in $\mathbf{H}$;

* the space of _extensive quantities_ on $X$ is the $R$-linear dual, namely the mapping space $[X,R]^\ast \coloneqq [[X,R], R]_{R Mod}$ formed in $R$-[[modules]] in $\mathbf{H}$.

  (here the operation $[[-,R],R]_{R Mod}$ happens to be what is also called the "[[continuation monad]]" for $R$)

* the [[integration]] map is the canonical [[evaluation]] pairing

  $$
    \int_X \;\colon\; [X,R] \times [X,R]^\ast  \longrightarrow R
    \,.
  $$

### In higher geometry and higher algebra

Viewed this way, this naturally generalizes to the case where $\mathbf{H}$ is in fact an [[(∞,1)-topos]] and $R \in CRing(\mathbf{H})$ an [[E-∞ ring]]. In this case $[X,R]$ is called the  $R$-[[cohomology]] [[spectrum]] of $X$ and $[X,R]^\ast$ is the corresponding [[generalized homology]] spectrum. In this form intensive and extensive properties appear in [[physics]] in the context of [[motivic quantization]] of [[local prequantum field theory]]. 

More generally, for $\chi$ an $R$-[[(∞,1)-line bundle]] over $X$ then the corresponding extensive object is the $\chi$-twisted [[Thom spectrum]] $R_{\bullet + \chi}(X)$ and the intensive object is the $\chi$-[[twisted cohomology]] [[spectrum]] $R^{\bullet + \chi}(X) = [R_{\bullet+ \chi}(X),R]_{R Mod}$. See at _[[motivic quantization]]_ for how this appears in [[physics]].


## References

The concepts of intensive and extensive quantity are highlighted in

* {#Grassmann1814} [[Hermann Grassmann]], _[[Ausdehnungslehre]]_, 1844

which states (p. xxiv, xxv) that intensive quantity is the topic of [[differential calculus]] and [[integration]] theory, while extensive quantity is the topic of this very _Ausdehnungslehre_.

General discussion includes

* Wikipedia, _[Intensive and extensive properties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties)_

A formalization in [[categorical logic]]/[[topos theory]] is proposed in

* {#Lawvere86} [[William Lawvere]], Introduction to _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]], Lectures given at a Workshop held at SUNY, Buffalo 1982. Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1174. 1986
 
Lawvere's terminology is probably (see at _[[objective logic]]_) inspired by

* {#Hegel1817} [[Georg Hegel]], part II "Philosophy of Nature", second section "Physics", B, [§298b](Science+of+Logic#PN298b) in _[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]_

and meant to be a formalization of this part of the "[[objective logic]]", see also at _[[Science of Logic]]_.

The first use of the terms 'intensive' and 'extensive' appears to be
