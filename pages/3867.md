### How does the "s" map work?

[[Bruce Bartlett]]: I don't understand the $s$ map in Example 5.1.11 in the online version of the book. It's supposed to be the automorphism
 \[
 s : \Gamma_{1,1} \rightarrow \Gamma_{1,1}
\] 
of the torus with one boundary circle which is the analogue of a map which I _do_ understand, the automorphism
\[
 s_t : \Gamma_{1,0} \rightarrow \Gamma_{1,0}
\]
of the ordinary torus (no boundary circle) to itself, which sends 
\[
 (\theta, \phi) \mapsto (\phi, -\theta).
\]
But the map $s_t$ doesn't seem to work if there is a boundary circle involved. Because an automorphism of $\Gamma_{1,1}$ is supposed to be the identity on the boundary circle, but the map $s_t$ isn't: it rotates the boundary circle a quarter rotation (right?). So how does the map $s$ work?
