### Errata

* pg 112, bottom of proof of Theorem 5.3.8, "the Dehn twist axiom MF7" should read MS7, I believe. [[Bruce Bartlett]]

### How does the "s" map work?

[[Bruce Bartlett]]: I don't understand the $s$ map in Example 5.1.11 in the online version of the book. It's supposed to be the automorphism
 \[
 s : \Gamma_{1,1} \rightarrow \Gamma_{1,1}
\] 
of the torus with one boundary circle which is the analogue of a map which I _do_ understand, the automorphism
\[
 s_t : \Gamma_{1,0} \rightarrow \Gamma_{1,0}
\]
of the ordinary torus (no boundary circle) to itself, which sends 
\[
 (\theta, \phi) \mapsto (\phi, -\theta).
\]
But the map $s_t$ doesn't seem to work if there is a boundary circle involved. Because an automorphism of $\Gamma_{1,1}$ is supposed to be the identity on the boundary circle, but the map $s_t$ isn't: it rotates the boundary circle a quarter rotation (right?). The reason I say so is the following picture: we think of the torus as $\mathbb{R}^2 / \mathbb{Z}^2$, as Bakalov and Kirillov encourage us to do. Then the presence of the boundary circle can be thought of as having a little tangent vector pointing to the right at all the lattice positions (this uses their alternative Definition 5.1.10 the extended surface category). The map $(x,y) \mapsto (y, -x)$ rotates the plane by a quarter rotation and takes the lattice to itself, hence it descends to the quotient. But this map rotates the tangent vector by a quarter rotation, and we're supposed to fix the tangent vectors!

So how does the map $s$ work?
