This is about tensor quantities like used in physics and geometry. For the notion of a "tensor" in [[enriched category theory]] see under [[copower]]. 

## Definition

### General

Generally, a _tensor_ is an element of a [[tensor product]].

### In differential geometry

Traditionally this is considered in [[differential geometry]] for the following case:

for $X$ a [[manifold]], $T X$ the [[tangent bundle]], $T^* X$ the [[cotangent bundle]], $\Gamma(T X)$, $\Gamma(T^* X)$ their spaces of [[sections]] and $C(X)$ the [[associative algebra]] of [[functions]] on $X$, a **[[rank]]-$(p,q)$ tensor** on $X$ is an element of the [[tensor product of modules]] over $C(X)$

$$
  t \in \Gamma(T X)^{\otimes_{C(X)}^p} \otimes_{C(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)^{\otimes^q_{C(X)}}
  \,.
$$

A rank $(p,0)$-tensor is also called a **covariant tensor** and a rank $(0,q)$-tensor a **contravariant tensor**. 

## Examples

### General

### In differential geometry

* A [[Riemannian metric]] is a symmetric rank $(2,0)$-tensor.

* A [[differential form]] of  degree $n$ is a skew-symmetric rank $(0,n)$-tensor.
