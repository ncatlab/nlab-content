This is about tensor quantities like used in physics and geometry. For the notion of a "tensor" in [[enriched category theory]] see under [[copower]]. 

## Definition

Generally, a _tensor_ is an element of a [[tensor product]].

Traditionally this is considered for the following case:

for $X$ a [[manifold]], $T X$ the [[tangent bundle]], $T^* X$ the [[cotangent bundle]], $\Gamma(T X)$, $\Gamma(T^* X)$ their spaces of [[section]]s and $C(X)$ the [[algebra]] of [[function]]s on $X$, a **[[rank]]-$(p,q)$ tensor** on $X$ is an element of the tensor product over $C(X)$

$$
  t \in \Gamma(T X)^{\otimes_{C(X)}^p} \otimes_{C(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)^{\otimes^q}
  \,.
$$
