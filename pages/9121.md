## Idea

In a context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]/[[differential cohesion]] the _reduction modality_ characterizes [[reduced objects]]. It forms itself the [[left adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[infinitesimal shape modality]].

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
  \,,
$$

where $\Re$ and $\&$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $\Im$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

Here $\Re$ is the **reduction modality**. The [[reflective subcategory]] that it defines is that of [[reduced objects]].
