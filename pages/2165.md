A complex number is an expression of the form $a + \mathrm{i} b$, where $a$ and $b$ are [[real numbers]] and $\mathrm{i}^2 = - 1$.  The set of complex numbers (in fact a [[field]] and [[topological vector space]]) is denoted $\mathbf{C}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

This can be thought of as:

*  the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ made into an [[associative algebra|algebra]] by the rule
   $$ (a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (a c - b d, a d + b c) ;$$
*  the subalgebra of those $2$-by-$2$ real [[matrix|matrices]] of the form
   $$ \left(\array { a & b \\ - b & a } \right);$$
*  the [[algebraic closure]] of $\mathbb{R}$ as a field;
*  the result of applying the [[Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction]] to $\mathbb{R}$;
*  the $2$-dimensional [[normed division algebra]];
*  the [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl_{0,1}(\mathbb{R})$;
*  the elliptic $2$-dimensional algebra of [[hypercomplex number]]s;
*  the [[complexification]] of $\mathbb{R}$.


We think of $\mathbb{R}$ as a [[subset]] of $\mathbb{C}$ by identifying $a$ with $a + 0 \mathrm{i}$.  $\mathbb{C}$ is equipped with an [[involution]], called __complex conjugation__, that maps $\mathrm{i}$ to $\bar{\mathrm{i}} = -\mathrm{i}$:
$$ \overline{a + \mathrm{i} b} = a - \mathrm{i} b .$$
$\mathbb{C}$ also has an [[absolute value]]:
$$ |{a + \mathrm{i} b}| = a^2 + b^2 ;$$
notice that the absolute value of a complex number is a non-negative real number.


Most concepts in analysis can be extended from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$, as long as they do not rely on the order in $\mathbb{R}$.  Sometimes $\mathbb{C}$ even works better, either because it is algebraically closed or because of Goursat\'s theorem.  Even when the order in $\mathbb{R}$ is important, often it is enough to order the absolute values of complex numbers.  See [[ground field]] for some of the concepts whose precise definition may vary with the choice of $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ (or even other possibilities).
