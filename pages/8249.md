In the literature this is often understood to be the default case of derived functors. For a discussion of how the following relates to the more general concepts of derived functors see at _[derived functor -- In homological algebra](derived+functor#InHomologicalAlgebra)_.

## Definition

The general concept of [[derived functor]] is in homological algebra usualy called the _[[total derived functor|total]] [[hyper-derived functor]]_, with just "derived functor" being reserved for a more restrictive case. In this tradition, we consider the special case first.
