This entry discusses the general notion of _[[derived functor]]_ in the context of [[homological algebra]], hence for functors between [[categories of chain complexes]].
In the literature this is often understood to be the default case of derived functors. For more discussion of how the following relates to the more general concepts of derived functors see at _[derived functor -- In homological algebra](derived+functor#InHomologicalAlgebra)_.

## Definition

The general concept of [[derived functor]] is in homological algebra usually called the _[[total derived functor|total]] [[hyper-derived functor]]_, with just "derived functor" being reserved for a more restrictive case. In this tradition, we consider the special case first and then generalize it in stages. The relation between all these notions is discussed [below](#Properties).

Throughout, let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be [[abelian categories]].

### Left derived functor 

Assume that the [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$ has [[projective objects|enough projectives]].


#### Evaluated on an object

+-- {: .num_defn #LeftDerivedFunctor}
###### Definition

For $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[right exact functor]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, its **left derived functor** is the functor

$$
  L_n F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}
$$

which sends an [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{A}$ with (any) [[projective resolution]] $((Q X)_\bullet \to X) \in Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(\mathcal{A})$ to the $n$th [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] $F((Q X)_\bullet) \in Ch_{\bullet}(\mathcal{B})$:

$$
  (L_n F)(X) \coloneqq H_n(F((Q X)_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

=--

This definition is indeed independent, up to [[natural isomorphism]], of the choice of resolution, see the discussion below.


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

That $q : (Q X) \to X$ is a projective resolution means that there is a [[chain map]]

$$
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    (Q X)_2 &\stackrel{q_2}{\to}& 0    
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^{Q X}_1}} && \downarrow
    \\
    (Q X)_1 &\stackrel{q_1}{\to}& 0    
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial^{Q X}_0}} && \downarrow
    \\
    (Q X)_0 &\stackrel{q_0}{\to}& X
  }
$$

which is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] and such that $(Q X)_n \in \mathcal{A}$ is a [[projective object]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

This being a quasi-isomorphism, in turn, is equivalent to 

1. $q_0$ inducing an [[isomorphism]] $(Q X)_0/im(\partial_0^{Q X}) = H_0(Q X) \to X$;

1. and isomorphisms $H_n(Q X) \to 0$ for all $n \geq 1$. 

This happens to be equivalent to the statement that the _augmented complex_

$$
  \cdots
    \stackrel{\partial_1^{Q X}}{\to}
  (Q X)_2 
    \stackrel{\partial_1^{Q X}}{\to}
  (Q X)_1
    \stackrel{\partial_0^{Q X}}{\to}
  (Q X)_0
     \stackrel{q_0}{\to}
  X
$$

is an [[exact sequence]], and traditionally the condition is often stated this way. But it somewhat hides the true meaning of the resolution and notably the fact that $(Q X)_0$ and $X$ are to be regarded as being in the same degree. It also does not naturally generalize to the case where $X$ itself is already a chain complex not concentrated in lowest degree (discussed [below](#LeftHyper)).

### Right derived functor

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[left exact functor]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, its **right derived functor** is the functor

$$
  R_n F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}
$$

which sends an [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{A}$ with (any) [[injective resolution]] $Q_\bullet \in Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(\mathcal{A})$ to the $n$th [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] $F(Q_\bullet) \in Ch_{\bullet}(\mathcal{B})$

$$
  (R_n F)(X) \coloneqq H_n(F(Q_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

=--

This definition is independent, up to [[natural isomorphism]], of the choice of $P_\bullet$.

###### Proposition

Let $F \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[left exact functor]] in the presence of [[injective object|enough injectives]]. Then for all $X \in \mathcal{A}$ there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  R^0F(X) \simeq F(X)
  \,.
$$

Dually, of $F$ is a [[right exact functor]] in the presence of [[projective object|enough projectives]], then 

$$
  L_0 F(X) \simeq F(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We discuss the first statement, the second is formally dual. 

By the discussion there, an [[injective resolution]] $X \stackrel{\simeq_{qi}}{\to} X^\bullet$ is equivalently an [[exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  0 \to X \hookrightarrow X^0 \to X^1 \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

If $F$ is left exact then it preserves this exact sequence by definition of left exactness, and hence 

$$
  0 \to F(X) \hookrightarrow F(X^0) \to F(X^1) \to \cdots
$$

is an exact sequence. But this means that 

$$
  R^0 F(X) \coloneqq ker(F(X^0) \to F(X^1)) \simeq F(X)
  \,.
$$

If 

$$
  (F \dashv G) : \mathcal{A}
  \stackrel{\overset{G}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
   \mathcal{B}
$$

is a pair of [[additive functor|additive]] [[adjoint functors]], then 

* the [[left adjoint]] $F$ is [[right exact functor|right exact]];

* the [[right adjoint]] $G$ is [[left exact functor|left exact]];

### Long exact sequence of a derived functor
 {#LongExactSequence}

+-- {: .num_prop #LongExactSequenceOfRightDerivedFunctorsFromShortExactSequence}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ be [[abelian categories]] and assume that $\mathcal{A}$ has [[injective object|enough injectives]].

Let $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ be a [[left exact functor]] and let

$$
  0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0
$$

be a [[short exact sequence]] in $\mathcal{A}$.  

Then there is a [[long exact sequence]] of images of these objects under the right derived functors $R^\bullet F(-)$ of 
def. \ref{LeftDerivedFunctor}

$$
  0 \to R^0F (A) = F(A) \to R^0 F(B) = F(B) \to R^0 F(C) 
   \stackrel{\delta_0}{\to} 
  R^1 F(A) \to R^1 F(B) \to R^1F(C)
   \stackrel{\delta_1}{\to}
  R^2 F(A) \to \cdots
$$

in $\mathcal{B}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [this lemma](projective+resolution#InjectiveResolutionOfExactSequenceByExactSequence) at _[[injective resolution]]_ we can find an [[injective resolution]]

$$
  0 \to A^\bullet \to B^\bullet \to C^\bullet \to 0
$$

of the given exact sequence which is itself again an exact sequence of cochain complexes.

Since $A^n$ is an [[injective object]] for all $n$, its component sequences $0 \to A^n \to B^n \to C^n \to 0$ are indeed [[split exact sequences]] (see the discussion there). Splitness is preserved by a functor $F$ and so it follows that

$$
  0 \to F(\tilde A^\bullet) \to F(\tilde B^\bullet) \to F(\tilde C^\bullet) \to 0
$$

is a again short exact sequence of cochain complexes, now in $\mathcal{B}$. Hence we have the corresponding [[homology long exact sequence]]


$$
  \cdots
   \to
  H^{n-1}(F(A^\bullet)) \to H^{n-1}(F(B^\bullet)) \to H^{n-1}(F(C^\bullet))
    \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H^n(F(A^\bullet)) \to H^n(F(B^\bullet)) \to H^n(F(C^\bullet))
    \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  H^{n+1}(F(A^\bullet)) \to H^{n+1}(F(B^\bullet)) \to H^{n+1}(F(C^\bullet))
   \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

But by construction of the resolutions and by def. \ref{LeftDerivedFunctor} this is equal to

$$
  \cdots
   \to
  R^{n-1}F(A) \to R^{n-1}F(B) \to R^{n-1}F(C) 
   \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  R^{n}F(A) \to R^{n}F(B) \to R^{n}F(C) 
    \stackrel{\delta}{\to}
  R^{n+1}F(A) \to R^{n+1}F(B) \to R^{n+1}F(C) 
   \to
  \cdots
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfRightDerivedFunctorsFromShortExactSequence} implies that one way to interpret $R^1 F(A)$ is as a "measure for how a [[left exact functor]] $F$ fails to be an [[exact functor]]". For, with $A \to B \to C$ any [[short exact sequence]], this proposition gives the exact sequence

$$
  0 \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to R^1 F(A)
$$

and hence $0 \to F(A) \to F(B) \to F(C) \to $ is a short exact sequence itself precisely if $R^1 F(A) \simeq 0$.

=--

In fact we even have the following.

+-- {: .num_prop }

Let $F$ be an [[additive functor]] which is an [[exact functor]]. Then 

$$
  R^{\geq 1} F = 0 
$$

and

$$  
  L_{\geq 1} F = 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Because an [[exact functor]] preserves all [[exact sequences]]. If $Y_\bullet \to A$ is a projective resolution then also $F(Y)_\bullet$ is exact in all positive degrees, and hence $L_{n\geq 1} F(A) ) H_{n \geq}(F(Y)) = 0$. Dually for $R^n F$.

###### Proposition

Let $F \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ be an [[additive functor|additive]] [[right exact functor]] with codomain an [[additive and abelian categories|AB5-category]]. 

Then the [[left derived functors]] $L_n F$ preserves [[filtered colimits]] precisely if filtered colimits of [[projective objects]] in $\mathcal{A}$ are $F$-[[acyclic objects]].
