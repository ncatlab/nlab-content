In the literature this is often understood to be the default case of derived functors. For a discussion of how the following relates to the more general concepts of derived functors see at _[derived functor -- In homological algebra](derived+functor#InHomologicalAlgebra)_.

## Definition

The general concept of [[derived functor]] is in homological algebra usualy called the _[[total derived functor|total]] [[hyper-derived functor]]_, with just "derived functor" being reserved for a more restrictive case. In this tradition, we consider the special case first.

Throughout, let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be [[abelian categories]].
such that $\mathcal{A}$ has [[projective objects|enough projectives]].

### Left derived functor 

#### Evaluated on an object


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[right exact functor]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, its **left derived functor** is the functor

$$
  L_n F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}
$$

which sends an [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{A}$ with (any) [[projective resolution]] $P_\bullet \in Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(\mathcal{A})$ to the $n$th [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] $F(P_\bullet) \in Ch_{\bullet}(\mathcal{B})$

$$
  (L_n F)(X) \coloneqq H_n(F(P_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

=--

This definition is independent, up to [[natural isomorphism]], of the choice of $P_\bullet$.

### Right derived functor

###### Definition

For $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[left exact functor]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, its **right derived functor** is the functor

$$
  R_n F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}
$$

which sends an [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{A}$ with (any) [[injective resolution]] $Q_\bullet \in Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}(\mathcal{A})$ to the $n$th [[chain homology]] of the [[chain complex]] $F(Q_\bullet) \in Ch_{\bullet}(\mathcal{B})$

$$
  (R_n F)(X) \coloneqq H_n(F(Q_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

=--

This definition is independent, up to [[natural isomorphism]], of the choice of $P_\bullet$.

###### Observation

If 

$$
  (F \dashv G) : \mathcal{A}
  \stackrel{\overset{G}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
   \mathcal{B}
$$

is a pair of [[additive functor|additive]] [[adjoint functors]], then 

* the [[left adjoint]] $F$ is [[right exact functor|right exact]];

* the [[right adjoint]] $G$ is [[left exact functor|left exact]];
