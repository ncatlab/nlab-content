#Idea#

A homotopy $3$-type is a special case of [[homotopy n-type]] and you are referred to that entry for the generalities.

#Models#

There are many useful algebraic models for a homotopy $3$-type. (Assume the homotopy type is connected for simplicity.)

1. [[2-crossed module]]s
1. [[crossed square]]s
1. [[cat-2-group]]s
1. [[Gray-group]]s: one-object groupoidal [[Gray-category|Gray-categories]]

One measure of the usefulness of a given model may be its ease of calculation (e.g., with a generalised [[van Kampen theorem]]) and of extraction of topologically significant invariants. In the above a lot more is known, from this viewpoint, about the second and third model than for the first.

Of course, any sufficient weak notion of $3$-[[3-groupoid|groupoid]] ought to qualify, by the [[homotopy hypothesis]].
