## Idea

For $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] (or more generally a [[compact topological group]]) the concept of _$G$-spectrum_ (or _$G$-equivariant spectrum_) is the generalization of that of [[spectrum]] as one passes from [[stable homotopy theory]] to [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]], or more generally, as $G$ is allow to vary, to [[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. 

Where the ordinary concept of [[spectrum]] is given in terms of [[looping and delooping]] of ordinary [[topological spaces]] by ordinary [[spheres]], a $G$-spectrum is instead given by looping and delooping of [[topological G-spaces]] with respect to [[representation spheres]] of $G$, namely [[one-point compactifications]] of linear $G$-[[representations]], for all representations appearing in a chosen "[[G-universe]]".

Such a [[G-universe]] is called _complete_ if it contains every [[irreducible representation]] of $G$, and the spectra modeled on such a complete $G$-universe are the _genuine $G$-spectra_. At the other extreme, if the [[G-universe]] contains only the trivial representations, then the resulting spectra are the _[[spectra with G-action]]_, also called _[[naive G-spectra]]_ for emphasis of the distinction to the previous case.

The genuine $G$-spectra are richer than _[[spectra with G-action]]_ and have better homotopy-theoretic properties. In particular the genuine [[equivariant cohomology]] theories which they [[Brown representability theorem|represent]] have [[suspension isomorphisms]] for suspension by all [[representation spheres]] and with respect to [[RO(G)-grading]].

When $G$ is the trivial group, a $G$-spectrum is also known as a [[coordinate-free spectrum]].


## Models

There are various equivalent ways to present genuine $G$-spectra.

### Indexed on all representations
 {#IndexedOnAllRepresentations}

([May 96, chapter XII](#May96), [Greenlees-May, section 2](#GreenleesMay)) 

Fix a [[G-universe]]. For $V$ any [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] [[representation]] in the universe, write $S^V$ for its [[representation sphere]]. For $V \hookrightarrow W$ a subrepresentation, write $W-V$ for the [[orthogonal complement]] representation. 

A _$G$-prespectrum_ $E$ is an assignment of a [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[G-space]] $E_V$ to each $G$-[[representation]] $V$ (in the given [[G-universe]]), equipped for each subrepresentation $V \hookrightarrow W$ with a pointed $G$-equivariant [[continuous function]]

$$
  \sigma_{V,W}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{W-V} \wedge E_V \longrightarrow E_W
$$

such that

1. $\Sigma_{V,V} = id$;

1. for any $Z \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow W$ we have [[commuting diagrams]]

   $$
     \array{
       S^{Z-W}\wedge S^{V-W} \wedge E_V
       &\stackrel{S^{Z-W}\wedge(\sigma_{V,W})}{\longrightarrow}& S^{Z-W}E_W
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Sigma_{Z,W}}}
       \\
       S^{Z-V}E_V &\stackrel{\sigma_{V,Z}}{\longrightarrow}& E_Z
     }
   $$

Write

$$
  \tilde \sigma_{V,W} \;\colon\; E_V \longrightarrow \Omega^{W-V}E_W
$$

for the [[adjuncts]] of these structure maps.

A $G$-prespectrum is called (at least in ([May 96, chapter XII](#May96)))

* a _$G$-$\Omega$-spectrum_ if all the $\sigma_{V,W}$ are [[weak homotopy equivalences]];

* a _$G$-spectrum_ if all the $\sigma_{V,W}$ are [[homeomorphisms]].


### Via orthogonal spectra with $G$-action

While the definition of [spectra indexed on all representations](#IndexedOnAllRepresentations) manifestly relates to the [[suspension isomorphism]] for smashing with [[representation spheres]] and shifting in [[RO(G)-grading]], the information encoded in the objects in this definition has much redundancy. A "smaller" definition of genuine $G$-spectra is given by [[orthogonal spectra]] equipped with $G$-action ([Mandell-May 04](#Mandellmay04), [Schwede 15](#Schwede15)).

### Via Mackey functors
 {#RelationToMackeyFunctors}

For $G$ a [[finite group]] then genuine $G$-spectra are equivalent to  _[[Mackey functors]]_ on the category of [[finite set|finite]] [[G-sets]].

([Guillou-May 11, theorem 0.1](#GuillouMay11), [Barwick 14, below example B.6](#Barwick14)).



### Via excisive functors

Characterization of $G$-spectra [via excisive functors]() on [[G-spaces]] is in ([Blumberg 05](#Blumberg05)).

## Properties

### Relation to spectra with $G$-action

(e.g. [Carlsson 92, p. 14](#Carlsson92), [GreenleesMay, p.16](#GreenleesMay))

### Equivariant stable Whitehead theorem
 {#EquivariantWhitehead}

The equivariant version of the stable [[Whitehead theorem]] holds:

a map of $G$-spectra $f \colon E \longrightarrow F$ is a [[weak equivalence]] (e.g. an $RO(G)$-degree-wise [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of [[topological G-spaces]] in the [model via indexing on all representations](#IndexedOnAllRepresentations)) precisely it if induces [[isomorphisms]] $\pi_\bullet(f) \colon \pi_\bullet(E) \longrightarrow \pi_{\bullet}(F)$ on all [[equivariant homotopy group]] [[Mackey functors]].

In the case of a [[cyclic group]] of prime order, genuine $G$-spectra admit a simple model which amounts to specifying a spectrum $E$, a $G$-action on $E$, a genuine fixed point spectrum $E^G$, and a diagram $E_{hG} \to E^G \to E^{hG}$.  See Example 3.29 in:
