## Idea

The concept of _$G$-spectrum_ (or $G$-equivariant spectrum) is the generalization of that of [[spectrum]] as one passes from [[stable homotopy theory]] to [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]], or more generally, as $G$ is allow to vary, of [[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. See there for more details.

Where the ordinary concept of [[spectrum]] is given in terms of [[looping and delooping]] by ordinary [[spheres]], a $G$-spectrum for $G$ a suitable [[topological group]] is instead given by looping and delooping with respect to [[representation spheres]] of $G$, namely [[one-point compactifications]] of linear $G$-[[representations]].

Equivalently, $G$-spectra are expressed by _[[Mackey functors]]_.

Such $G$-spectra (or "genuine $G$-spectra", for emphasis) are richer than _[[spectra with G-action]]_ and have better homotopy-theoretic properties. The latter appear as the special case of $G$-spectra "for the trivial universe" and are also called _[[naive G-spectra]]_. To distinguish from that case for emphasis $G$-spectra are also called _genuine $G$-spectra_.
