A _symmetric monoidal functor_ is a [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ between [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal categories]] that is a [[monoidal functor]] which respects the symmetry on both sides.

In fact, a symmetric monoidal functor is the same as a [[braided monoidal functor]] (as long as it goes between symmetric monoidal categories).

It would be good to include the actual definition.  It can be found in, for example,

* [[John Baez]], [Some definitions everyone should know](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2004/definitions.pdf).
