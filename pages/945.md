##Idea##

In [[topology]], a not necessarily continuous function $f:X\to Y$ between [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff spaces]] is _dominant_ , or _dense_ , in the sense that the [[image]] of $f$ is [[dense subspace|dense]] in $Y$, precisely if every continuous map $g:Y\to Z$ to some other Hausdorff space $Z$ is uniquely determined by $g\circ f$.

The concept of a **dense functor** is a generalization of this concept to functors. 

An important special case that was also historically the source of the concept, is the case of a [[dense subcategory]] inclusion: a [[subcategory]] $S$ of category $C$ is _dense_ if every object $c$ of $C$ is a [[colimit]] of a diagram of objects in $S$, in a canonical way. 

##Definition##

A functor $i:S\to C$ is __dense__ if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions.

1. every object $c$ of $C$ is the vertex of the following colimit over the [[comma category]] $(i/c)$:
   $$
   \mathrm{colim}((i/c)\stackrel{\mathrm{pr}_S}{\longrightarrow} S \stackrel{i}{\to} C)
   $$

1. every object $c$ of $C$ is the $C(i-,c)$-weighted colimit of $i$.  This version generalizes more readily to the [[enriched category|enriched]] context.

1. the corresponding [[nerve|nerve functor]] (or "restricted [[Yoneda embedding]]") $C \to [S^{op},Set]$ is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]]. 


##Terminology and History##
 
[[John Isbell]] introduced [[dense subcategory|dense subcategories]] in a seminal paper [(Isbell 1960)](#MR0175954) under the name *left adequate*.  The dual notion of *right adequate* was also introduced and subcategories satisfying both were called *adequate*. It was also shown that while the relation of being left (or right) adequate is not transitive, being adequate is transitive. He also brought out interesting connections with [[set theory]] and [[measurable cardinals]].

Later in the mid 60s, [[Friedrich Ulmer]] considered the concept for more general functors $F:C\to D$, not only inclusions $I:C\hookrightarrow D$, and introduced the name _dense_ for them.

Independently, [[Pierre Gabriel]] worked on this concept and their work flew together in what was to become the concept of a [[locally presentable category]] of their 1971 monograph. It is also good to keep in mind the '_Abelian_' subcontext in the background, in particular the developments in module theory e.g. Lazard's (1964) characterization of flat modules as filtered colimits of finitely generated free modules.

More recently, [[Jacob Lurie]] has referred to the analogue notion for [[(∞,1)-categories]] as *strongly generating* in a version (arXiv v4) of his [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]], but that term normally means [[strong generator|something different]].

## Examples

1. Let $V$ be a category of [[algebras]] and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $V$ has a presentation with operations of at most arity $n$.  Let $v$ be the free $V$-algebra on $n$ generators.  Then the full subcategory with object $v$ is dense in $V$.

1. In $\Set$, a singleton space is dense.

##Warning##

There is a different notion of a dense subcategory, often used in [[shape theory]], which has a bit of the same spirit. A [[full subcategory]] $D\subset C$ is
__dense__ in this second sense, if every object in $C$ admits a $D$-expansion. 

A _$D$-expansion_ of an object $X$ in $C$ is a morphism
$X\to \mathbf{X}$ in $\mathrm{pro}C$ such that $\mathbf{X}$
is in $\mathrm{pro}D$ and $X$ is the rudimentary system (constant inverse system) corresponding to $X$; moreover one asks that the morphism is universal among all such morphisms $X\to\mathbf{Y}$. 

Given a dense subcategory $D\subset C$ one defines
an abstract shape category $\mathrm{Sh}(C,D)$ which has the same objects as $C$, but the morphisms are the equivalence classes of morphisms in $\mathrm{pro}D$ of $D$-expansions.
