# Definition #

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **paracompact** if every open [[cover]]ing $U$ has a [[refinement]] by an open covering $V$ that is _locally finite_, i.e. such that every point has a neighbourhood that intersects only finitely many open subsets in $V$ .

Often one requires a paracompact space to be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] as well; the issues here are the same as those for [[compact space]]s.


For paracompact spaces, [[numerable open cover|numerable open covers]] are cofinal in all open covers.


# Examples #

* locally compact spaces

  * every [[compact space]] is paracompact;

  * any [[second-countable topological space|second-countable]] [[locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space is paracompact;

* metric spaces

  * every [[separable space|separable]] [[metric space]] is paracompact;

  * every [[metric space]] whatsoever is paracompact, assuming the [[axiom of choice]];

  * pseudometric spaces are paracompact under the same conditions, if one does not require Hausdorffness;

* special cases

  * the [[Sorgenfrey line]] is a good example of a paracompact space that doesn\'t fit into other general classes of paracompact spaces;

* counterexamples

  * the [[long line]] is *not* paracompact, even though it is a [[manifold]] (unless one specifically requires paracompactness of manifolds).


# Properties #

## cohomology of paracompact spaces ##

* On paracompact spaces, abelian [[Cech cohomology]] does compute [[abelian sheaf cohomology]], 

  i.e. the canonical morphism $H_{Cech}(X,A) \to H(X,A)$ for  $A$ any [[chain complex]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] is an [[isomorphism]] when the [[topological space]] underlying $X$ is paracompact.
