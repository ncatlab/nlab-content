# Definition #

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **paracompact** if

* it is Hausdorff;

* every open covering $U$ has a refinement by an open covering $V$ that is _locally finite_ i.e. such that every point has a neighbourhood that intersects only finitely many open subsets in $V$ .

# Examples #

* every [[compact space]] is paracompact;

* every [[metric space]] is paracompact.
