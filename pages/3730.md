While the [[Riemann-Hilbert problem|Hilbert's 21st problem]] has a negative solution, there is a generalized sheaf theoretical formulation which does lead to an equivalence of categories discovered by Mebkhout and a bit later also by [[Kashiwara]].

The most basic form of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence states that the category of [[flat connection|flat]] [[vector bundle]]s is equivalent to the category of [[local system]]s.
