In good cases a [[homomorphism]] $f\colon C_1 \to C_2$ of [[algebraic curves]] allows to push-forward [[algebraic line bundles]] such as to induce a homomorphism of the corresponding [[Jacobian varieties]]/[[Picard varieties]]  $J_1 \to J_2$. The _Prym variety_ of $f$ then is the [[kernel]] of this map, hence the space of algebraic line bundles on $C_1$ which pushes to the trivial line under $f$.
