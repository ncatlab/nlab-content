## Idea

The concept of _smooth groupoid_ is the first generalization of the concept of _[[smooth sets]]_ ([[smooth spaces]]) to [[higher differential geometry]], it is a joint generalization of [[smooth sets]] ([[smooth manifolds]], [[diffeological spaces]], ...), [[orbifolds]] and [[Lie groupoids]], hence it also subsumes [[deloopings]] of [[Lie groups]] and [[diffeological groups]]. It also subsumes smooth [[moduli stacks]], for instance of [[gauge fields]].

Technically, a smooth groupoid is a [[groupoid]]-valued [[stack]] on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]], or equivalently on its [[dense subsite]] [[CartSp]] of just [[Cartesian spaces]] and [[smooth functions]] between them. This is equivalently an [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-topos|1-truncated]] [[smooth infinity-groupoid]].

For more see also at _[[geometry of physics -- smooth homotopy types]]_.

for the [[category]] of [[groupoid]]-valued [[presheaves]].

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $0 \lt r \lt 1 \in \mathbb{R}$ let 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \simeq D^n_r \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$

Be the smooth function that regards $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the standard $n$-[[disk]] of radius $r$ around the origin in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

For $X \in gPSh(CartSp)$ we write

$$
  (D^n)^* X \coloneqq {\lim_\to}_r X(D^n_r) \in Grpd
$$

for the [[stalk]] of $X$ at the origin of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is a [[functor]]

$$
  (D^n)^* \colon gPSh(CartSp) \to Grpd
  \,.

###### Definition

A morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ in $gPSh(CartSp)$ we call a 
_local [[weak equivalence]]_ if for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
the stalk 

$$
  (D^n)^* f \colon (D^n)^* X \to (D^n)^* Y
$$

is an [[equivalence of groupoids]].

###### Definition

Write 

$$
  Smooth1Type 
   \coloneqq
  L_{lwe} gPSh(CartSp)
$$

for the [[(2,1)-category]] which is the [[simplicial localization]] of groupoid-valued presheaves at the local weak equivalences.

An [[object]] $X \in Smooth1Type$ we call a **[[smooth groupoid]]** or
**[[smooth homotopy type|smooth homotopy 1-type]]**.

A _[[smooth stack]]_ or _[[smooth groupoid]]_ is a [[stack]] on the site [[SmoothMfd]] of [[smooth manifolds]] or equivalently (and often more conveniently) on its [[dense subsite]] [[CartSp]] of just [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n, n \in \mathbb{N}$ and [[smooth functions]] between them, equipped with the standard [[coverage]] of [[good open covers]].

We write 

$\;\;\; $[[SmoothGrpd]] $\coloneqq Sh_{(2,1)}(CartSp) \simeq L_{lhe} Func(CartSp^{op}, Grpd) $ 

for the [[(2,1)-category]] of [[stacks]] on this site, equivalently the result of taking [[groupoid]]-valued [[presheaves]] and then  [[simplicial localization|universally]] turning local (as seen by the [[coverage]]) [[equivalences of groupoids]] into global [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category]].


## Properties

### Embedding into smooth $\infty$-groupoids

By generalizing here [[groupoids]] to general [[Kan complexes]] and [[equivalences of groupoids]] to [[homotopy equivalences]] of Kan complexes, one obtains _smooth [[∞-stacks]]_ or _[[smooth ∞-groupoids]]_, which we write 

$\;\;\; $[[Smooth∞Grpd]] $\coloneqq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp) \simeq L_{lhe} Func(CartSp^{op}, KanCplx) $. 

We often write $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for short.

By the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma]] there is a sequence of [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|faithful inclusions]]

$\;\;\;$ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[SmoothGrpd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]].

This induces a corresponding inclusion of [[simplicial objects]] and hence of [[groupoid objects in an (∞,1)-category|groupoid objects]]

$$
  LieGrpd \hookrightarrow Grpd_\infty(SmoothMfd)  \hookrightarrow  Grpd_\infty(Smooth\infty Grpd)
  \,.
$$

For $\mathcal{G}_\bullet \in Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H})$ a groupoid object we write 

$$
  \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G} \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n} \mathcal{G}_n
$$

for its [[(∞,1)-colimit|(∞,1)-colimiting]] [[cocone]], hence $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbf{H}$ (without subscript decoration) denotes the [[realization]] of $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ as a single object in $\mathbf{H}$.

By the [[Giraud-Rezk-Lurie axioms]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ this morphism $\mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}$ is a [[1-epimorphism]] -- an [[atlas]] -- and its construction establishes is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] $Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H}) \simeq \mathbf{H}^{\Delta^1}_{1epi}$, hence morphisms $\mathcal{G}_\bullet \to \mathcal{K}_\bullet$ in $Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H})$ are equivalently [[diagrams]] in $\mathbf{H}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{G}_0 &\to& \mathcal{K}_0
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \mathcal{G} &\to& \mathcal{K}
  }
  \,.
$$

This is evidently more constrained that just morphisms 

$$
  \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{K}$ in $\mathbf{H}
$$

by themselves. The latter are the "generalized" or [[Morita morphisms]] between the groupoid objects $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$, $\mathcal{K}_\bullet$. These can be modeled as $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$-$\mathcal{K}_\bullet$-[[bibundles]].

###### Example

###### Proposition

The canonical identification yields a [[full subcategory]]

$$
  Smooth0Type \hookrightarrow Smooth1Type
  \,.
$$

=--


Every [[Lie groupoid]] presents a smooth groupoids. Those of this form are also called [[differentiable stacks]].

A [[0-truncated]] smooth groupoid is equivalently a [[smooth space]]. 

For $G$ a [[smooth group]], its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ is a smooth groupoid, the [[moduli stack]] of smooth $G$-[[principal bundles]].



### Moduli spaces of gauge fields

The mathematical concept of _[[smooth groupoid]]_ is well familiar, in slight disguise, in basic _[[gauge theory]]_. Here we make this explicit for basic [[electromagnetism]]. For more exposition and details along these lines see
([[schreiber:bachelor thesis Eggertsson|Eggertson 14]]).

We have seen in _[The electromagnetic field strength](#ElectromagneticFieldStrength)_ that a configuration of the electromagnetic field on $\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by a [[differential 1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$, the "[[electromagnetic potential]]". It describes a field configuration with [[field strength]] Lorentz tensor (with respect to the canonical [[coordinates]] $(t, x^1, x^2, x^3) \coloneqq (x^i)_{i = 1}^4 = $ on $\mathbb{R}^4$)

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F & = \mathbf{d}A 
      \\
      & =
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
      \\
      & 
       + B_1 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3
       + B_2 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1
       + B_3 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2
  \end{aligned}     
$$

with electric [[field strength]] $(E_i \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4))_{i = 1}^3$ and magnetic [[field strength]] $(B_i \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4))_{i = 1}^3$ given  that is given by the [[de Rham differential]] of $A$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F = \mathbf{d}A
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

After Maxwell it was thought that $F \in \Omega^2(\mathbb{R}^4)$ alone genuinely reflects the configuration of the electromagnetic field. But with the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] it became clear that it is indeed the potential $A$ itself that reflects the configuration of the electromagnetic field: in the presence of [[magnetic flux]] or other topoligical constraints, there can be different $A, A' $ with the _same_ $F = \mathbf{d}A = \mathbf{d}A'$ which nevertheless describe experimentally distinguishable electromagnetic field configurations. (Distinguishable by the [[Aharonov-Bohm effect]] and also to some extent by [[Dirac charge quantization]]; this is discussed at _[Circle-principal connections](#CirclePrincipalConnections)_ below.)

However, not all different gauge potentials describe different physics. The actual configuration space of electromagnetism on a [[spacetime]] $X$ is finer than $\mathbf{\Omega}^2_{cl}(X)$ but coarser than $\mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)$. And it is not quite a smooth space itself, but a _[[smooth groupoid]]_:

one finds that two electromagnetic potentials $A, A' \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$ for which there is a function $\lambda \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4)$ such that 

$$
  A' = A + \mathbf{d}\lambda
$$

represent _different but [[equivalence|equivalent]]_ field configurations. One says that _$\lambda$ induces a [[gauge transformation]] from $A$ to $A'$_. We write $\lambda \colon A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A'$ to reflect this.

So the configuration space of electromagnetism does not just have points and coordinate systems. But it is also equipped with the information of a space of gauge transformations between any two coordinate systems laid out in it (which may be empty). 

To see what the structure of such a _smooth gauge groupoid_ should be, notice that the above defines an [[action]] of smooth functions $\lambda$ on smooth $1$-forms $A$, 


+-- {: .num_defn #ActionOfFunctionsOnForms}
###### Definition

For any $U \in $ [[CartSp]], Write $\Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$ for the set of [[differential 1-forms]] on $X \times U$ with no components along $U$, and write $C^\infty(X \times U , U(1))$ for the [[group]] of [[circle group]] valued [[smooth functions]]. There is an [[action]] of this group on the 1-forms 

$$
  \rho_U 
   \colon 
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) \times C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))
    \to
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)
$$

given by

$$
  \rho_U \colon (A,\lambda) \mapsto A + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda
  \,.
$$

=--

Given such an action of a [[discrete group]] on a [[set]], we might be demoted to form the [[quotient]] set $\Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)/C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$. This set contains the gauge [[equivalence classes]] of $U$-parameterized collections of electromagnetic gauge fields on $X$. But it turns out that this is too little information to correctly capture physics. For that instead we need to remember not just that two gauge fields are equivalent, but how they are equivalent. That is, we for $\lambda$ a gauge transformation from $A_1$ to $A_2$, we should have an [[equivalence]] $\lambda \colon A_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A_2$.

+-- {: .num_defn #EMGaugeGroupoidOverU}
###### Definition

The [[action groupoid]]

$$
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)//  C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))
  \coloneqq
  (
    \Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U) \times C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))
    \stackrel{\overset{t = \rho}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{s = p_1}{\longrightarrow}}
    \Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)
  )
$$

is the [[groupoid]] whose 

* [[objects]] are $U$-parameterized collections of gauge potentials $A \in \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$;

* [[morphisms]] are pairs $(A,\lambda)$ with $A$ an object and $\lambda \in C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$, with [[domain]] $A$ and [[codomain]] $A + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda$;

* [[composition]] is given by multiplication of the $\lambda$-labels in the group $C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$.

=--

This is the discrete _gauge groupoid_ for $U$-parameterized collections of fields. It refines the _[[gauge group]]_, which is recoverd as its [[fundamental group]]:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $A_0 \coloneqq 0 \in \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$ be the trivial gauge field. Then its [[automorphism group]] in the gauge groupoid of def. \ref{EMGaugeGroupoidOverU} is the group of [[circle]]-group valued functions on $U$:

$$
  \pi_1(\Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)// C^\infty(X \times U, U(1)), A_0)
  =
  Aut(A_0)
  \simeq
  C^\infty(U,U(1))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition, an automorphism of $A_0$ is given by a function 
$\lambda \in C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$ such that $A_0 = A_0 + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda$. This is the case precisely if $\mathbf{d}_X \lambda = 0$, hence if $\lambda$ is contant along $X$. But a function on $X \times U$ which is constant along $X$ is canonically identified with a function on just $U$.

=--

All this data in in fact [[natural transformation|natural]] in $U$. Recall that $\Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) = \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)(U)$ is the set of $U$-charts of the smooth moduli space $\mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)$ of smooth 1-forms on $X$. Similarly $C^\infty(X \times U) = \mathbf{C}^\infty(X)(U)$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There is a homomorphism of [[smooth spaces]] (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces})

$$
  \rho \colon \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)\times \mathbf{C}^\infty(X) \to \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)
$$

from the product smooth space, def. \ref{ProductOfSmoothSpaces}, of the smooth moduli spaces of 1-forms and 0-forms on $X$, def. \ref{SmoothSpaceOfFormsOnSmoothSpace}, to that of smooth functions, def. \ref{SmoothSpaceOfSmoothFunctions}, whose component over $U \in $ [[CartSp]] is the action 

$$
  \rho_U \colon (A,\lambda) \mapsto  A + \mathbf{d}\lambda
$$

of def. \ref{ActionOfFunctionsOnForms}.

=--

We then also want to consider a _smooth action groupoid_.

Write 

$$
  \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X) // \mathbf{C}^\infty(X, U(1))
  : 
  CartSp^{op}

  Grpd
$$

for the [[contravariant functor]] from coordinate systems to the [[category]] of [[groupoids]], which assigns to $U \in CartSp$ the discrete action groupoid of $U$-collections of gauge fields of def. \ref{EMGaugeGroupoidOverU}.

$$
  U \mapsto \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) // C^\infty(X\times U, U(1))

Such a structure _[[presheaf]]_ of [[groupoids]] is a common joint generalization of the notion of [[discrete groupoids]] and [[smooth spaces]]. We call them _[[smooth groupoids]]_. This is what we turn to in _[Smooth groupoids](#SmoothGroupoids)_
