## Definition

A _smooth groupoid_ is a [[stack]] on the [[site]] [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$.

This is equivalently an [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-topos|1-truncated]] [[smooth infinity-groupoid]].

## Examples

Every [[Lie groupoid]] presents a smooth groupoids. Those of this form are also called [[differentiable stacks]].

A [[0-truncated]] smooth groupoid is equivalently a [[smooth space]]. 

For $G$ a [[smooth group]], its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ is a smooth groupoid, the [[moduli stack]] of smooth $G$-[[principal bundles]].
