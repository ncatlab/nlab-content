## Idea

The concept of _smooth groupoid_ is the first generalization of the concept of _[[smooth sets]]_ ([[smooth spaces]]) to [[higher differential geometry]], it is a joint generalization of [[smooth sets]] ([[smooth manifolds]], [[diffeological spaces]], ...), [[orbifolds]] and [[Lie groupoids]], hence it also subsumes [[deloopings]] of [[Lie groups]] and [[diffeological groups]]. It also subsumes smooth [[moduli stacks]], for instance of [[gauge fields]].

Technically, a smooth groupoid is a [[groupoid]]-valued [[stack]] on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]] (sometimes called a "smooth stack", but this is somewhat ambiguous), or equivalently on its [[dense subsite]] [[CartSp]] of just [[Cartesian spaces]] and [[smooth functions]] between them. This is equivalently an [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-topos|1-truncated]] [[smooth ∞-groupoid]].

###### Remark
**on how not to define smooth groupoids**

One could be tempted to define smooth groupoids to be [[internal groupoids]] in [[smooth sets]]. Restricting this definition to groupoids internal to [[diffeological spaces]] yields the concept of _[[diffeological groupoid]]_, restricting it further to groupoids internal to [[smooth manifolds]] yields the concept of _[[Lie groupoid]]_. While these are respectable definitions in themselves, care needs to be exercized in interpreting them correctly: they do _not_ in themselves exhibit the correct [[homotopy theory]] of smooth groupoids. One may of course fix this by changing the concept of [[morphisms]] to generalized morphisms called _[[Morita morphisms]]_ or _[[bibundles]]_. These are certainly useful tools for working with smooth groupoids, and they serve to present their correct homotopy theory, but they do not serve well as the definition of this homotopy theory. For instance without further insight it is rather impossible to guess form the concept of [[bibundles]] between groupoids its correct generalization to [[smooth 2-groupoids]] etc.

But just as the definition of [[smooth sets]], contrasted with that of [[smooth manifolds]], is not only more powerful but also _simpler_, so there is a definition of smooth groupoids which not only does give the correct homotopy theory, but it does so while being much more transparent than these more traditional presentations.

Now, this definition, given below, amounts to saying that smooth groupoids are stacks on the site of smooth manifolds, and that in turn may tend to not sound like a simple definition at all. But there is a further simplification at work. Traditional texts tend to define stacks in terms of the comparatively intricate structures of [[pseudofunctors]] or (dually under the [[Grothendieck construction]]) [[fibered categories]] satisying [[descent]], and the rich structure of these combinatorial objects tends to become unwieldy already for fairly simple examples. But the theory of [[localization]] of categories turns out to handle the same theory of stacks by much more tractable means (e.g. [Hollander 01](stack#Hollander01)). Here a stack is _presented_ by a plain functor with no [[descent]] condition imposed, something that is hence as simple as a pair of two presheaves. The nature of stacks is then instead just encoded in remembering that some of the morphisms of presheaves of groupoids are to be labeled as [[weak equivalences]], namley those that locally restrict to equivalences of groupoids. 

This style of definition combines the simplicity of the naive definition of Lie groupoids with the full power of [[homotopy theory]], and it immediately generalizes to a definition of [[∞-stacks]] which is just as simple, hence, in the present contex, to a definition of [[smooth ∞-groupoid]].

Write [[CartSp]] for the [[category]] of [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with [[smooth functions]] between them.

###### Definition

A _pre-smooth groupoid_ $X$ is a [[presheaf]] of [[groupoids]] on [[CartSp]], hence a [[functor]]

$$
  X \colon CartSp^{op} \longrightarrow Grpd
$$

from [[CartSp]] to the [[1-category]] [[Grpd]].

We write  

$$
  PreSmooth0Type
  \coloneqq
  Funct(CartSp^{op}, Grpd)
$$ 

for the [[functor category]], the _[[category]] of pre-smooth groupoids_.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #YonedaIntuition}
###### Remark

The intuition is the following: a smooth structure on a groupoid is to be determined by which maps from abstract [[coordinate systems]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ into it are to be regarded as smooth maps. Since, by its groupoidal nature, two such maps may be related by a smooth [[homotopy]]/[[gauge transformation]] (in physics: "twisted sectors"), the collection of all smooth functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$  into the smooth groupoid $X$ is itself a bare groupoid. We here _define_ a pre-smooth groupoid as something that assigns to each abstract coordinate systems a groupoid of would-be smooth maps into it

"$X(\mathbb{R}^n) = \left\{ \array{
     & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{smooth}}
    \mathbb{R}^n
    &\Rightarrow&
    X
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{smooth}}
 } \right\}$"


=--

The following is the [[Yoneda lemma]] in this context, which says that this intuition is fully correct:


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ defines a pre-smooth groupoid $\underline{\mathbb{R}^n}$, def. \ref{PreSmoothGroupoid}, by the assinment

$$
  \underline{\mathbb{R}^n} \colon \mathbb{R}^k  \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R}^n)
   \in 
  Set
  \hookrightarrow
  Grpd
$$

where the [[set]] of [[smooth functions]] on the right is regarded as a [[groupoid]] with only [[identity]] morphism. This construction constitutes a [[fully faithful functor]]

$$
  \underline{(-)}
  \colon
  CartSp \hookrightarrow PreSmooth0Type
$$

making [[CartSp]] a [[full subcategory]] of that of pre-smooth groupoids (the [[Yoneda embedding]]).
Under this embedding for any pre-smooth groupoid $X\in PreSmooth0Type$ and any Cartesian space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a [[natural equivalence]] of [[groupoids]]

$$
  Hom_{PreSmooth0Type}(\underline{\mathbb{R}^n}, X)
  \simeq
  X(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$

(the [[Yoneda lemma]] proper).

=--

This statement expresses just the intuition of remark \ref{YonedaIntuition} and justifies the remove the quotation marks shown there. It also justifies dropping the extra underline denoting the [[Yoneda embedding]]. We will freely identify from now on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the pre-smooth groupoid that it represents.

A _[[smooth stack]]_ or _[[smooth groupoid]]_ is a [[stack]] on the site [[SmoothMfd]] of [[smooth manifolds]] or equivalently (and often more conveniently) on its [[dense subsite]] [[CartSp]] of just [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n, n \in \mathbb{N}$ and [[smooth functions]] between them, equipped with the standard [[coverage]] of [[good open covers]].

We write 

$\;\;\; $[[SmoothGrpd]] $\coloneqq Sh_{(2,1)}(CartSp) \simeq L_{lhe} Func(CartSp^{op}, Grpd) $ 

for the [[(2,1)-category]] of [[stacks]] on this site, equivalently the result of taking [[groupoid]]-valued [[presheaves]] and then  [[simplicial localization|universally]] turning local (as seen by the [[coverage]]) [[equivalences of groupoids]] into global [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category]].


## Properties

### Embedding into smooth $\infty$-groupoids

By generalizing here [[groupoids]] to general [[Kan complexes]] and [[equivalences of groupoids]] to [[homotopy equivalences]] of Kan complexes, one obtains _smooth [[∞-stacks]]_ or _[[smooth ∞-groupoids]]_, which we write 

$\;\;\; $[[Smooth∞Grpd]] $\coloneqq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp) \simeq L_{lhe} Func(CartSp^{op}, KanCplx) $. 

We often write $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for short.

By the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma]] there is a sequence of [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|faithful inclusions]]

$\;\;\;$ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[SmoothGrpd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]].

This induces a corresponding inclusion of [[simplicial objects]] and hence of [[groupoid objects in an (∞,1)-category|groupoid objects]]

$$
  LieGrpd \hookrightarrow Grpd_\infty(SmoothMfd)  \hookrightarrow  Grpd_\infty(Smooth\infty Grpd)
  \,.
$$

For $\mathcal{G}_\bullet \in Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H})$ a groupoid object we write 

$$
  \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G} \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n} \mathcal{G}_n
$$

for its [[(∞,1)-colimit|(∞,1)-colimiting]] [[cocone]], hence $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbf{H}$ (without subscript decoration) denotes the [[realization]] of $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ as a single object in $\mathbf{H}$.

By the [[Giraud-Rezk-Lurie axioms]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ this morphism $\mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}$ is a [[1-epimorphism]] -- an [[atlas]] -- and its construction establishes is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] $Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H}) \simeq \mathbf{H}^{\Delta^1}_{1epi}$, hence morphisms $\mathcal{G}_\bullet \to \mathcal{K}_\bullet$ in $Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H})$ are equivalently [[diagrams]] in $\mathbf{H}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{G}_0 &\to& \mathcal{K}_0
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \mathcal{G} &\to& \mathcal{K}
  }
  \,.
$$

This is evidently more constrained that just morphisms 

$$
  \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{K}$ in $\mathbf{H}
$$

by themselves. The latter are the "generalized" or [[Morita morphisms]] between the groupoid objects $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$, $\mathcal{K}_\bullet$. These can be modeled as $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$-$\mathcal{K}_\bullet$-[[bibundles]].

### Moduli spaces of gauge fields

#### Groupoid of electromagnetic field configurations
 {#GroupoidOfElectromagneticFieldConfigurations]

The mathematical concept of _[[smooth groupoid]]_ is well familiar, in slight disguise, in the [[physics]] of basic _[[gauge theory]]_. Here we make this explicit for basic [[electromagnetism]]. For more exposition and details along these lines see
([Eggersson 14](#Eggersson14)).

We have seen in _[The electromagnetic field strength](#ElectromagneticFieldStrength)_ that a configuration of the electromagnetic field on $\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by a [[differential 1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$, the "[[electromagnetic potential]]". It describes a field configuration with [[field strength]] Lorentz tensor (with respect to the canonical [[coordinates]] $(t, x^1, x^2, x^3) \coloneqq (x^i)_{i = 1}^4 = $ on $\mathbb{R}^4$)

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F & = \mathbf{d}A 
      \\
      & =
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
      \\
      & 
       + B_1 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3
       + B_2 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1
       + B_3 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2
  \end{aligned}     
$$

with electric [[field strength]] $(E_i \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4))_{i = 1}^3$ and magnetic [[field strength]] $(B_i \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4))_{i = 1}^3$ given  that is given by the [[de Rham differential]] of $A$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F = \mathbf{d}A
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

After Maxwell it was thought that $F \in \Omega^2(\mathbb{R}^4)$ alone genuinely reflects the configuration of the electromagnetic field. But with the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] it became clear that it is indeed the potential $A$ itself that reflects the configuration of the electromagnetic field: in the presence of [[magnetic flux]] or other topoligical constraints, there can be different $A, A' $ with the _same_ $F = \mathbf{d}A = \mathbf{d}A'$ which nevertheless describe experimentally distinguishable electromagnetic field configurations. (Distinguishable by the [[Aharonov-Bohm effect]] and also to some extent by [[Dirac charge quantization]]; this is discussed at _[Circle-principal connections](#CirclePrincipalConnections)_ below.)

However, not all different gauge potentials describe different physics. The actual configuration space of electromagnetism on a [[spacetime]] $X$ is finer than $\mathbf{\Omega}^2_{cl}(X)$ but coarser than $\mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)$. And it is not quite a smooth space itself, but a _[[smooth groupoid]]_:

one finds that two electromagnetic potentials $A, A' \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$ for which there is a function $\lambda \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4)$ such that 

$$
  A' = A + \mathbf{d}\lambda
$$

represent _different but [[equivalence|equivalent]]_ field configurations. One says that _$\lambda$ induces a [[gauge transformation]] from $A$ to $A'$_. We write $\lambda \colon A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A'$ to reflect this.

So the configuration space of electromagnetism does not just have points and coordinate systems. But it is also equipped with the information of a space of gauge transformations between any two coordinate systems laid out in it (which may be empty). 

To see what the structure of such a _smooth gauge groupoid_ should be, notice that the above defines an [[action]] of smooth functions $\lambda$ on smooth $1$-forms $A$, 


+-- {: .num_defn #ActionOfFunctionsOnForms}
###### Definition

For any $U \in $ [[CartSp]], Write $\Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$ for the set of [[differential 1-forms]] on $X \times U$ with no components along $U$, and write $C^\infty(X \times U , U(1))$ for the [[group]] of [[circle group]] valued [[smooth functions]]. There is an [[action]] of this group on the 1-forms 

$$
  \rho_U 
   \colon 
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) \times C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))
    \to
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)
$$

given by

$$
  \rho_U \colon (A,\lambda) \mapsto A + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda
  \,.
$$

=--

Given such an action of a [[discrete group]] on a [[set]], we might be demoted to form the [[quotient]] set $\Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)/C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$. This set contains the gauge [[equivalence classes]] of $U$-parameterized collections of electromagnetic gauge fields on $X$. But it turns out that this is too little information to correctly capture physics. For that instead we need to remember not just that two gauge fields are equivalent, but how they are equivalent. That is, we for $\lambda$ a gauge transformation from $A_1$ to $A_2$, we should have an [[equivalence]] $\lambda \colon A_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A_2$.

* [[objects]] are $U$-parameterized collections of gauge potentials $A \in \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$;

* [[morphisms]] are pairs $(A,\lambda)$ with $A$ an object and $\lambda \in C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$, with [[domain]] $A$ and [[codomain]] $A + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda$;

Let $A_0 \coloneqq 0 \in \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$ be the trivial gauge field. Then its [[automorphism group]] in the gauge groupoid of def. \ref{EMGaugeGroupoidOverU} is the group of [[circle]]-group valued functions on $U$:

$$
  \pi_1(\Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)// C^\infty(X \times U, U(1)), A_0)
  =
  Aut(A_0)
  \simeq
  C^\infty(U,U(1))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition, an automorphism of $A_0$ is given by a function 
$\lambda \in C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$ such that $A_0 = A_0 + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda$. This is the case precisely if $\mathbf{d}_X \lambda = 0$, hence if $\lambda$ is contant along $X$. But a function on $X \times U$ which is constant along $X$ is canonically identified with a function on just $U$.

=--

All this data in in fact [[natural transformation|natural]] in $U$. Recall that $\Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) = \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)(U)$ is the set of $U$-charts of the smooth moduli space $\mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)$ of smooth 1-forms on $X$. Similarly $C^\infty(X \times U) = \mathbf{C}^\infty(X)(U)$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There is a homomorphism of [[smooth spaces]] (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces})

$$
  \rho \colon \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)\times \mathbf{C}^\infty(X) \to \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)
$$

from the product smooth space, def. \ref{ProductOfSmoothSpaces}, of the smooth moduli spaces of 1-forms and 0-forms on $X$, def. \ref{SmoothSpaceOfFormsOnSmoothSpace}, to that of smooth functions, def. \ref{SmoothSpaceOfSmoothFunctions}, whose component over $U \in $ [[CartSp]] is the action 

$$
  \rho_U \colon (A,\lambda) \mapsto  A + \mathbf{d}\lambda
$$

of def. \ref{ActionOfFunctionsOnForms}.
