## Idea

In the context of [[topology]], a _topological $G$-space_ (traditionally just _$G$-space_, for short, if the context is clear) is a [[topological space]] equipped with an [[action]] of a [[topological group]] $G$ (often, but crucially not always, taken to be a [[finite group]]).

The canonical [[homomorphisms]] of topological $G$-spaces are $G$-equivariant [[continuous functions]], and the canonical choice of [[homotopies]] between these are $G$-equivariant continuous homotopies (for trivial $G$-action on the interval). A $G$-[[equivariant Whitehead theorem|equivariant version]] of the [[Whitehead theorem]] says that on [[G-CW complexes]] these $G$-equivariant [[homotopy equivalences]] are equivalently those maps that induce [[weak homotopy equivalences]] on all [[fixed point]] spaces for all [[subgroups]] of $G$ (compact subgroups, if $G$ is allowed to be a [[Lie group]]). 

By [[Elmendorf's theorem]], this, in turn, is equivalent to the [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over the [[orbit category]] of $G$. See below at _[In topological spaces -- Homotopy theory](#HomotopyTheory)_.

See ([Henriques-Gepner 07](#HenriquesGepner07)) for expression in terms of [[topological groupoids]]/[[orbispaces]].

In the context of [[stable homotopy theory]] the [[stabilization]] of $G$-spaces is given by [[spectra with G-action]]; these lead to [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. See there for more details. (But beware that in this context one considers the richer concept of [[G-spectra]], which have a [[forgetful functor]] to [[spectra with G-action]] but better homotopy theoretic properties. ) The union of this as $G$ is allowed to vary is the [[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]].

## Properties

### Model structure and homotopy theory
 {#ModelStructureAndHomotopyTheory}

The standard [[homotopy theory]] on $G$-spaces used in [[equivariant homotopy theory]] considers [[weak equivalences]] which are [[weak homotopy equivalence]] on all (ordinary) [[fixed point]] spaces for all suitable [[subgroups]]. By [[Elmendorf's theorem]], this is equivalent to [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over the [[orbit category]] of $G$.

On the other hand there is also the standard homotopy theory of [[infinity-actions]], presented by the [[Borel model structure]], in this context also called the "coarse" or "naive" equivariant model structure ([Guillou](#Guillou)).
