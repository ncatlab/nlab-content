## Idea

In the context of [[topology]], a _topological $G$-space_ (traditionally just _$G$-space_, for short, if the context is clear) is a [[topological space]] equipped with an [[action]] of a [[topological group]] $G$ (often, but crucially not always, taken to be a [[finite group]]).

In the context of [[homotopy theory]], the [[category]] of topological $G$-spaces is regarded as a [[homotopical category]] with [[weak equivalences]] being the $G$-equivariant continuous functions which restrict to [[weak homotopy equivalences]] on all [[fixed point]] sets. This defines the [[equivariant homotopy theory]], see there for more details. This is equivalently presented by just [[G-CW complexes]]; and by [[Elmendorf's theorem]] it is equivalent to the [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over the [[orbit category]] of $G$.  The union of this as $G$ is allowed to vary is the _[[global equivariant homotopy theory]]_.

> add the following statement: on cell complexes the fixed-point-wise weak homotopy equivalences are equivalently the homotopy equivalences where the homotopy itself is required to be $G$-equivariant. It is in dropping this condition on the homotopies that one passes from "genuine" to "naive" equivariant homotopy theory. 

In the context of [[stable homotopy theory]] the [[stabilization]] of $G$-spaces is given by [[spectra with G-action]]; these lead to [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. See there for more details. (But beware that in this context one considers the richer concept of [[G-spectra]], which have a [[forgetful functor]] to [[spectra with G-action]] but better homotopy theoretic properties. ) The union of this as $G$ is allowed to vary is the [[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]].

## Properties

### Model structure and homotopy theory

The standard [[homotopy theory]] on $G$-spaces used in [[equivariant homotopy theory]] considers [[weak equivalences]] which are [[weak homotopy equivalence]] on all (ordinary) [[fixed point]] spaces for all suitable [[subgroups]]. By [[Elmendorf's theorem]], this is equivalent to [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over the [[orbit category]] of $G$.

On the other hand there is also the standard homotopy theory of [[infinity-actions]], presented by the [[Borel model structure]], in this context also called the "coarse" equivariant model structure ([Guillou](#Guillou)).
