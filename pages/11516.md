## Idea

In the context of [[topology]], a _topological $G$-space_ (traditionally just _$G$-space_, for short, if the context is clear) is a [[topological space]] equipped with an [[action]] of a [[topological group]] $G$ (often, but crucially not always, taken to be a [[finite group]]).

In the context of [[homotopy theory]], the [[category]] of topological $G$-spaces is regarded as a [[homotopical category]] with [[weak equivalences]] being the $G$-equivariant continuous functions which restrict to [[weak homotopy equivalences]] on all [[fixed point]] sets. This defines the [[equivariant homotopy theory]], see there for more details. This is equivalently presented by just [[G-CW complexes]]; and by [[Elmendorf's theorem]] it is equivalent to the [[(âˆž,1)-presheaves]] over the [[orbit category]] of $G$.  The union of this as $G$ is allowed to vary is the _[[global equivariant homotopy theory]]_.

In the context of [[stable homotopy theory]] the [[stabilization]] of $G$-spaces is given by [[spectra with G-action]]; these lead to [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. See there for more details. (But beware that in this context one considers the richer concept of [[G-spectra]], which have a [[forgetful functor]] to [[spectra with G-action]] but better homotopy theoretic properties. ) The uniomn of this as $G$ is allowed to vary is the [[global equivariant stable homotopy theory]].
