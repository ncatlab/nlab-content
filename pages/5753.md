## Definition

For $S : C \to \mathbb{A}^1$ an [[action functional]], the $\mathcal{O}(C)$-[[module]] of its **Noether identities** is the [[kernel]] $N_S \hookrightarrow Der(\mathcal{O}(C))$ of the canonical morphism

$$
  \iota_{d S} : Der(\mathcal{O}(S)) \to \mathcal{O}(S)
  \,.
$$

See [[BRST-BV complex]] for background and details.


## Examples

Assume that $C$ is sufficiently well behaved and of finite dimension such that the module of [[derivation]]s has (locally) a [[basis]] $\{\partial_i\}_i$. Then the Noether identities are (locally) tuples of functions $\{v^i\}$ such that

$$
  \sum_i v^i \partial_i S = 0
  \,.
$$
