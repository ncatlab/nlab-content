## Idea

In _[[algebraic topology]]_ by a _CW-pair_ $(X,A)$ is meant a [[CW-complex]] $X$ equipped with a sub-complex inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$.

The concept appears prominently in the discussion of [[ordinary homology|ordinary]] [[relative homology]] and generally in the [[Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms]] for [[generalized homology]]/[[generalized cohomology]].

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[CW complex]], the inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ of any subcomplex has an [[open neighbourhood]] in $X$ which is a [[deformation retract]] of $A$. In particular such an inclusion is a _[good pair](relative+homology#GoodPair)_ in the sense of [[relative homology]].

###### Proposition

For $(X,A)$ a CW-pair, then the $A$-[[relative singular homology]] of $X$ coincides with the [[reduced singular homology]] of the [[quotient space]] $X/A$: 

$$
  H_n(X , A)
  \simeq
  \tilde H_n(X/A)
 \,.
$$

For instance ([Hatcher, prop. 2.22](#Hatcher)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption we can find a [[neighbourhood]] $A \stackrel{j}{\to} U \hookrightarrow X$ such that $A \hookrightarrow U$ has a [[deformation retract]] and hence in particular is a [[homotopy equivalence]] and so induces also isomorphisms on all [[singular homology]] groups. 

It follows in particular that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the canonical morphism $H_n(X,A) \stackrel{H_n(id,j)}{\to} H_n(X,U)$ is an [[isomorphism]], by [homotopy invariance](relative+homology#HomotopyInvariance) of [[relative singular homology]].

Given such $U$ we have an evident [[commuting diagram]] of pairs of [[topological spaces]]

$$
  \array{
    (X,A) &\stackrel{(id,j)}{\to}& (X,U) &\leftarrow& (X-A, U - A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    (X/A, A/A) &\stackrel{(id,j/A)}{\to}& (X/A, U/A) &\leftarrow& (X/A - A/A, U/A - A/A)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the right vertical morphism is in fact a [[homeomorphism]].

Applying relative singular homology to this diagram yields for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[commuting diagram]] of abelian groups

$$
  \array{
    H_n(X,A) &\underoverset{\simeq}{H_n(id,j)}{\to}& H_n(X,U) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& H_n(X-A, U - A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    H_n(X/A, A/A) &\underoverset{\simeq}{H_n(id,j/A)}{\to}& H_n(X/A, U/A) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& H_n(X/A - A/A, U/A - A/A)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the left horizontal morphisms are the above isomorphims induced from the deformation retract. The right horizontal morphisms are isomorphisms by [excision](relative%20homology#Excision) and the right vertical morphism is an isomorphism since it is induced by a homeomorphism. Hence the left vertical morphism is an isomorphism ([[2-out-of-3]] for isomorphisms).
