## Definition

For $\Gamma : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[functor]] we say that it _has [[codiscrete object]]s_ if it has a  [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] [[right adjoint]] $coDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$. 

An object in the [[essential image]] of $coDisc$ is called a **codiscrete object.

This is for instance the case for the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] of a [[local topos]] $ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$. 

If one thinks of $\mathcal{E}$ as a [[category]] of [[spaces]], then the codiscrete objects are called [[codiscrete spaces]].

The dual notion is that of _[[discrete objects]]_.

## Properties

$\Gamma$ is a [[faithful functor]] on [[morphisms]] whose [[codomain]] is concrete.

###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{E}$ has a [[terminal object]] that is preserved by $\Gamma$, then $\mathcal{E}$ has concrete objects.

This is ([Shulman, theorem 1](#Shulman)).

###### Proposition

If $\mathcal{E}$ has codiscrete objects and has [[pullbacks]] that are preserved by $\Gamma$ and , then $\Gamma$ is a [[Grothendieck fibration]].

This is ([Shulman, theorem 2](#Shulman)).
