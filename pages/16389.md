## Idea

What is called _light-cone gauge quantization_ is one approach to the [[quantization]] of [[sigma models]] whose [[target space]] has a [[lightlike]] [[Killing vector]]. The strategy of this approach is to [[gauge fixing|gauge fix]] the [[metric]] and [[diffeomorphisms]] of the [[worldvolume]] such that also the worldvolume has a [[lightlike]] [[Killing vector field]] and such that this is mapped to the given one on target space.

This typically fixes most of the available gauge freedom, and the strategy is then to apply [[quantization]] to what remains. For more on this general idea see at _[[quantization commutes with reduction]]_.

Often this is considered for [[target space]] being [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ and with $X^+ \coloneqq X^0 - X^1$ denoting one of its canonical lightlike [[coordinates]]. If $\tau$ denotes similarly a lightlike coordinate function on the [[worldvolume]], then the condition of light-cone gauge reads

$$
  X^+ = p^+ \tau
$$

for some proportionality constant $p^+$. This is how light cone gauge appears in much of the physics literature.

## Applications

### Quantization of Green-Schwarz super $p$-brane sigma models

Light cone gauge quantization is the only method by which [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma models]] have been quantized, to date.
