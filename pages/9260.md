This entry (apart from few remarks) will be mainly about the general statistics and mathematical statistics. More about physical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and probabilistic interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] see there. There is also a technical notion of [[statistic]] (singular). 

## Idea

Statistics studies analysis of collections of 
random or sample data, and probabilistic 
likelihood of various inferences
on the basis of these data, as well as the mathematical regularities in large ensembles of occurences of such data.

In physics, statistics also pertains to the behaviour of 
large ensembles of particles. For identical particles 
this is the subject of [[particle statistics]] and for
general systems the subject of [[statistical mechanics]].

Mathematical statistics is based on probability theory. 
Most of the standard formalism uses measure theory as used in probability. Statistical mechanics in addition heavily uses [[ergodic theory]]. 


### Definitions

A statistical model is a measurable function $P : \Theta \to \Delta(X)$, where $X$ and $\Theta$ are [[measurable spaces]] and $\Delta(X)$ is the [[simplex]] of [[probability measures]] over $X$.


### To do
