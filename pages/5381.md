## Idea

A [[chain complex]] $A_\bullet$ in an [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$ is called **perfect** if

* it is [[bounded chain complex]];

* of [[projective module|projective]]

* and [[finitely generated modules]].


(or maybe some slight variant of this...)

## Perfect complexes of abelian sheaves

Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a [[ringed space]].  A [[chain complex]] $F$ of $\mathcal{O}_X$-[[sheaf of modules|modules]] is called **perfect** if it is locally [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to a [[bounded complex]] of [[free sheaf|free]] $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of [[sheaf of finite type|finite type]].

Let $D(X)$ be the [[derived category]] of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules.  The [[full subcategory]] $D(X)_perf \subset D(X)$ of perfect complexes is [[triangulated category|triangulated]], and stable under derived inverse image and derived tensor product.  Further there is an inclusion
  $$D(X)_perf \subset D(X)_coh$$
where $D(X)_coh \subset D(X)$ is the full subcategory of complexes with [[coherent sheaf|coherent]] [[cohomology]].  When $X$ is [[regular scheme|regular]], there is further an equality $D(X)_perf = D(X)_coh$.  Since the latter is equivalent to the the [[derived category of coherent sheaves]], there is an equivalence
$$D(X)_perf \stackrel{\sim}{\to} D(Coh(X))$$
when $X$ is [[regular scheme|regular]].
