## Idea

The _hyperbolic plane_ is the analog of the ordinary [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[plane]] as one passes from [[Euclidean geometry]] to [[hyperbolic geometry]]. It is the 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] example of a [[hyperbolic space]].

## Definition

As a [[Riemannian manifold]], a **hyperbolic plane** is a [[complete space|complete]] [[contractible]] 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[constant function|constant]] [[negative number|negative]] [[Riemann curvature]] (equivalently, Gaussian curvature).  

## Properties

The intrinsic geometry of a hyperbolic plane is completely determined by its curvature; any two hyperbolic planes are related by a [[conformal transformation]], and a self-conformality of a hyperbolic plane is necessarily an [[isometry]].  

Hyperbolic planes are also [[homogeneous spaces]]: there is a unique oriented [[isometry]] relating any two [[geodesic]] rays.

The [[incidence geometry]] of geodesics and points in the hyperbolic plane is equivalent to that of an open circular disc in the Euclidean plane (and several other obviously-equivalent things) &#8212; this is the Beltrami disc model.
