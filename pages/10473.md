As a Riemannian manifold, a **hyperbolic plane** is a [[complete space|complete]] [[contractible]] two-dimensional $C^3$ [[manifold]] of constant negative Riemannian (equivalently, Gaussian) [[curvature]] (necessarily being actually $C^\infty$).  The intrinsic geometry of a hyperbolic plane is completely determined by its curvature; any two hyperbolic planes are conformal, and a self-conformality of a hyperbolic plane is necessarily an isometry.  Hyperbolic planes are also homogeneous spaces: there is a unique oriented isometry relating any two geodesic rays.

The [[incidence geometry]] of geodesics and points in the hyperbolic plane is equivalent to that of an open circular disc in the Euclidean plane (and several other obviously-equivalent things) â€” this is the Beltrami disc model.
