_Under Construction - The following material needs the blessing of an expert._

## Idea

Given a smooth morphism $f:M\to N\in Diff$ in , an $n$-dimensional connected open subset $U \subseteq M$ and a differential $n$-form $\omega\in\Omega^n(N)$, we have the pullback $f^*\omega\in\Omega^n(M)$ and the pushforward $f_*U$ that satisfy

$$\int_U f^*\omega = \int_{f_*U} \omega.$$

_Transgression_ can be thought of as a generalization of this situation. For instance, given a smooth manifold $M$, let $LM$ denote the [[loop space]] of $M$, that is, $Hom(S^1,M)$.

_Harry_: It's not obvious whether or not you mean the space of smooth loops or continuous loops, nor how you equip this space, which presumably has the compact-open topology, with a smooth manifold structure at all.  This is important for the next part.  Also, the the connected open subset U was originally called a "subdomain", but I looked it up and could not find any references.  Since domain means connected open set, I assume that my replacement of the term "subdomain" with the much more common "connected open subset" did not change the meaning.  

Note: I changed the thing about the loop space for clarity, but it's still not clear to me which loop space and which smooth structure we give it.

I'm also afraid that calling the loop space functor L could be confusing, given that the loop space is traditionally denoted by $\Omega$, but this is unfortunate given the also-very-standard symbol for the module of differentials.

[[David Roberts]]: LM is standard notation for the free loop space, as is mentioned in the text. The Frechet manifold structure on LM does, a little surprisingly, not give rise to the compact-open topology, as I learned recently. For details of the manifold LM see almost anything of what [[Andrew Stacey]] has written. Oh, and it is always smooth loops, not continuous loops.

A $0$-form $f:LM\to \mathbb{R}$ induces a $1$-form $L^*f\in \Omega^1(M)$ and a loop $\gamma: S^1\to M$ in $M$ determines a point $L_*\gamma$ in $LM$. Then we give the condition that for any $0$-form $f: LM\to \mathbb{R}$ and any loop $\gamma: S^1\to M$,

$$\int_\gamma L^*f = \int_{L_*\gamma} f.$$

The right-hand side is simply evaluation of the $0$-form at the point determined by $\gamma$, from which it follows that the integral of a 1-form $L^*f$ over a loop $\gamma: S^1 \to M$ can be computed simply by evaluation.
