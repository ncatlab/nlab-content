## Idea

In as far as the notion of [[functor]] generalizes that of [[function]]
and that of [[profunctor]] generalizes that of [[relation]], the
notion of _graph_ of a (pro)functor generalizes that of [[graph of a function]].

Just as the [[graph of a function]] $f : X \to Y$, 
or more generally that of a [[relation]] $R \subset X \times Y$
for $X,Y \in Set = 0 Cat$
is nothing but the [[category of elements]] of the corresponding 
characteristic function $\chi_R : X \times Y \to (-1)Cat = \{0,1\}$, so the graph
of a functor $F\colon C \to D$, or more generally that of a [[profunctor]]
$\chi : C^{op} \times D \to 0 Cat = Set$, is nothing but its [[category of elements]].

Generally, the graph of a functor 
$f : C \to D$ between $(n,r)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]]
is the 
[[Grothendieck construction]] of the corresponding correspondence:
the fibration classified by the correspondence, 
i.e. the [[comma object]]

$$
  \array{
    Graph(f) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C^{op} \times D &\stackrel{\chi_f}{\to}& (n-1,r-1)Cat
  }
$$

whenever this makes sense. For instance in the context of 
$(\infty,1)$-[[Higher Topos Theory|category theory]] the graph
may be taken to be the fibration classified by $\chi_f : C \times D^{op} \to (\infty,0)$
as described at  [[universal fibration of (âˆž,1)-categories]].


## Definition 

For $n \leq \infty$ let $(n-1) Cat$ and $n Cat$ be a realization of the 
notions of $n$-category of $(n-1)$-categories and of the $(n+1)$-category of $n$-categories,
respectively,
such that standard constructions of [[category theory]] work,
in particular a version of the [[Yoneda lemma]].
See [[higher category theory]]. 


Then with $C,D \in n Cat$ let $f : C \to D$ be a ($n$-)[[functor]].

By the general logic of [[distributor]]s this defines an $n$-correspondence

$$
  \chi_f : C^{op} \times D \stackrel{f^{op} \times Id}{\to} D^{op} 
     \times D \stackrel{Func(-,-)}{\to} (n-1) Cat
$$

The **graph** of $f$ is the fibration $Graph(f) \to C^{op} \times D$ classified
by $\chi_f$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: It's not obvious to me that this is the best thing to call the graph of a functor; there are lots of other graphy things one can construct from a functor that all reduce to the usual notion of the graph of a function.  To start with, there is of course also the induced opfibration oven $C\times D^{op}$, would you call that the "opgraph"?  But actually, the two-sided fibration $D \leftarrow P \to C$ (an opfibration over $C$ and a fibration over $D$) looks to me more like a graph.  And then there is of course the *other* profunctor induced by $f$, which gives a fibration over $C\times D^{op}$, an opfibration over $C^{op}\times D$, and a two-sided fibration from $C$ to $D$.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: I would be inclined to loosely say "graph" for all of these and to introduce terminology like "opgraph" when it really matters which specific realization we mean. Because all these seem to be so similar to me that I am not sure if it is worth distinguishing them a lot. For instance, wouldn't an analogous discussion be possible concerning what we call $F^{op} : C^{op} \to D^{op}$ given a functor $F : C \to D$? I don't actually know what a standard term is, does one say "opfunctor" for this? But I'd say it doesn't matter much either way, calling $F^{op}$ just a functor which effectively is the functor $F$ doesn't do much harm.

[[Colin Zwanziger]]: Aren't we better off defining [[graph of a function]] as a span to avoid an arbitrary choice of $\langle 1, f\rangle$ or $\langle f, 1\rangle$ and then treating the two-sided fibration as the graph of a functor?Edit: Actually, we would still have to choose whether we were taking the graph of the representable or corepresentable profunctor induced by the functor, since these yield different spans. But we have that two functors F and G are adjoint iff ([[adjoint functors#In_terms_of_graphs2sided_discrete_fibrations|Lawvere's definition]])  the (graph of F)_A and (graph of G)_B agree. One level down we would have two functions f and g are adjoint (=inverse) iff (graph of f)_A and (graph of g)_B agree, but the two notions of graph turn out to be the same at this level.

## Examples 

### Graphs of 0-functors 

To reproduce the ordinary notion of [[graph of a function]] let $(n,r) = (0,0)$.
then $(n,r)$-categories $X,Y$ are just sets and a functor $f : X \to Y$ is
just a function between sets. Moreover, the category of $(n-1,r) = (-1,0)$-categories
is the set $\{0,1\}$ of truth values, as described at [[(-1)-category]].
The [[profunctor]] corresponding to $f : X \to Y$ is therefore the 
characteristic function

$$
  \chi_f : X \times Y \to \{0,1\}
$$

that maps

$$
  \chi_f(x,y) = 
    \left\lbrace
      \array{
        1 & if f(x) = y
        \\
        0 & otherwise
      }
    \right.
    \,.
$$

(Notice that in this case $X^{op} = X$.)

The [[2-pullback]] of ${*} = {1} \to \{0,1\}$ along $\chi_f$ is 
just the ordinary [[pullback]]

$$
\array{
  Graph(f) &\to& {*}
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  X \times Y
  &\stackrel{\chi_f}{\to}&
  \{0,1\}
}
$$

which identifies $Graph(f) \hookrightarrow X \times Y$ with the subset of pairs $(x,y)$
for which $f(x) = y$. This is the ordinary notion of [[graph of a function]].

### Graphs of 1-functors 

For $f : C \to D$ an ordinary [[functor]], with corresponding [[profunctor]]
$\chi_f : C^{op} \times D \to Set$, the category $Graph(f)$ is the 
[[category of elements]] $\int \chi_f$ of $\chi_f$.

If we regard $C$ and $D$ as [[2-category|2-categories]] under the embedding
$1Cat \hookrightarrow 2Cat$ then the profunctor $\chi_f$ corresponding to 
$f$ is of the form $\chi_f : C^{op} \times D \to Cat$
and in this context $Graph(f) \to C^{op} \times D$ is the 
[[Grothendieck construction]] on $\chi_f$.
