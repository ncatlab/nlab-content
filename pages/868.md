## Idea

A _total order_ on a set is a way of ordering its elements to say that some elements precede others, with the understanding that any two elements can be compared one way or the other.


## Definitions

Given a [[set]] $S$, a __total order__ on $S$ is a (binary) [[relation]] $\leq$ with the following properties:
* [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]: for any element $x$ of $S$, $x \leq x$;
* [[transitive relation|transitivity]]: whenever $x \leq y \leq z$, then $x \leq z$;
* [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]: whenever $x \leq y \leq x$, then $x = y$;
* [[total relation|totality]]: for any $x$ and $y$ in $S$, $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$.

A __toset__ is a set equipped with a partial order.


## Relation to simplices

The category of finite nonempty totally ordered sets and order-preserving maps is called $\Delta$, the [[simplex category]]. 

The category of *all* finite totally ordered sets and order-preserving maps is called $\Delta_a$, the **augmented** simplex category.


## Relation to linear orders

A [[linear order]] is much like a total order, except that it is based on an irreflexive relation $\lt$.

Using [[excluded middle]], one can move between linear orders and total orders using [[negation]]; that is, the negation of a total order is a linear order and vice versa.  Actually one usually swaps the order too, as follows:
* $x \leq y$ iff $y \nless x$;
* $x \lt y$ iff $y \nleq x$.

One often sees $x \lt y$ defined as $x \le y$ but $x \ne y$; this is equivalent, but doesn\'t show the duality explicitly.  Similarly, one often sees $x \leq y$ defined as $x \lt y$ or $x = y$; this is not even equivalent constructively, although it is classically.

In [[classical mathematics]], the distinction between total orders and linear orders is merely a terminological technicality, which is not always observed; more precisely, there is a [[natural isomorphism|natural bijection]] between the set of total orders on a given set $S$ and the set of linear orders on $S$, and one distinguishes them by their notation.  In [[constructive mathematics]], however, they are irreducibly different.
