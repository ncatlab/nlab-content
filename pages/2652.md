There are several processes of acting on a [[category]] $C$ to give it certain properties in such a way that $C$ embeds as a [[subcategory]] of the new category, called a _completion_ of $C$:

* [[ideal completion]] of a category
* [[profinite completion of a group|profinite completion]] of a discrete group
* [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of an enriched category
* [[free completion]] 
* [[free cocompletion]]
* [[exact completion]]
