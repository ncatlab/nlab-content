## Idea

The [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[operads]], and whose morphisms are operad [[homomorphisms]].

Details depend on the particular flavor of operad being used (the choice of enrichment, the choice of symmetry or not, etc).

## Related concepts

There are natural functors from and to $Opead$ to [[Cat]], [[dSet]], etc.

category: category

[This](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0061) looks interesting (Kriz and May). 

Getzler talk abstract, GATA Sheffield 2008:  	 Abstract:
I give a new formulation of the axioms for operads, which covers all of the variants of the theory, such as cyclic operads, modular operads, PROPs, wheeled PROPs, as well as simplicially enriched variants, such as topological field theories of different types.

Toen and Vezzosi: Algebraic geometry over model categories. Early paper, looks very nice! Applications to interpreting DG-schemes, and to defining etale K-theory of E-infty algebras. Expectation to extend the classical work for E-infty algebras to the more general setting of AG over a model cat, for the following concepts: tangent Lie algebra, cotangent complex, Hochschild cohom, K-theory, A-Q cohomology. Would like to do AG over a symmetric monoidal infty-cat, need strictification results. An E-infty alg should be a monoid in a SM infty-cat. Pp 34: Short nice review of operads and E-infty stuff.

Loday on the operad of associative algebras with derivations, formal group laws, and more <http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4730>

[arXiv:1207.3467] Reedy categories which encode the notion of category actions
fra arXiv Front: math.CT av Julia E. Bergner, Philip Hackney
Using the structure of the categories {\Delta} and {\Omega} governing
category and operad structures, respectively, we define categories which
instead encode the structure of a category acting on a category, or a category
acting on an operad. We prove that the former has the structure of an elegant
Reedy category, whereas the latter has the structure of a generalized Reedy
category.

I asked in what generality you can define a cat A object in cat B in terms of the representing functor factoring. Peter Arndt explained the following to me in July 09: There is a hierarchy as follows:
PROs, PROPs, operads, Algebraic theories, sketches, gen sketches. Somehow this hierarchy explains when things commute and hence somehow answers the question. He also mentioned Joyal (maybe CRM notes) on some approach to spectra relating to this. R-mod would be an algebraic theory. See talk by Baez for some of the hierarchy.
