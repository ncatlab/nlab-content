## Idea

In [[classical mathematics]], an element of a [[poset]] is positive if and only if it not a [[bottom element]].

A more subtle definition is needed in [[constructive mathematics]]; analogously to how "nonempty sets" may need to be replaced by [[inhabited sets]].  In mathematics that is both constructive and [[predicative mathematics|predicative]], positivity can be axiomatised but not defined.


## Definitions

Let $L$ be a [[preordered set]], and let $x$ be an element of $L$.

###### Definition
**(in [[classical mathematics]], and in [[predicative mathematics]] with [[classical logic]])**

An element $x\in L$ is __positive__ if it not a [[bottom element]], equivalently if there exists an element $y\in L$ such that $x \leq y$ is false.

###### Definition
**(in [[classical mathematics]], and in impredicative [[constructive mathematics]])**

An element $x\in L$ is __positive__ if for any way of writing $x$ as a [[join]] of some [[subset]] $A$ of $L$, $A$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]].
=--

+-- {: .num_defn #predconstdef}
###### Definition
**(in [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] mathematics)**

A **positivity predicate** on $L$ is a [[predicate]] $\diamond x$, pronounced "$x$ is positive", such that
*  Whenever $x$ is positive and $x$ is the [[join]] of $A$, then some element of $A$ is positive: $\diamond x,\; x = \bigvee A \;\vdash\; \exists\, u \in A,\; \diamond u$.
*  If $x$ is the join of $A$ on the assumption that $x$ is positive, then $x$ really is that join: $\diamond x \;\Rightarrow\; x = \bigvee A \;\vdash\; x = \bigvee A$.

Any two of these definitions can be shown to be equivalent in the union of the corresponding foundational systems.  Specifically:

* In impredicative constructive mathematics, one can prove that every preorder has a unique positivity predicate, which must match Definition \ref{constdef}.

* In predicative mathematics with classical logic, one can prove that every poset has a unique positivity predicate, which must match the Definition \ref{preddef}.

* In [[classical mathematics]] (with [[classical logic]] and impredicativity), all the definitions are equivalent.


## Examples

Every [[power set]] has a positivity predicate: $x$ is positive iff $x$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]].  (Of course, there are few power sets in predicative mathematics, but often it is enough to think of the power set as a [[proper class]].)

The positive predicate on a [[locale]] plays a role in the definition of an [[overt space]].  Locale theory is often considered constructively but impredicatively; in predicative constructive mathematics, a positivity predicate is used in the corresponding theory of [[formal topology]].

Every [[atom]] of $L$ is positive, and indeed an atom is precisely a [[minimal element|minimal]] positive element.
