A __direct limit__ is the same thing as a [[colimit]].  (Similarly, an [[inverse limit]] is the same thing as a [[limit]].)  In this context, a __direct system__ is the same thing as a [[diagram]], and a __direct cone__ is the same thing as a [[cocone]].

Many authors restrict this terminology to limits over [[directed sets]] (or [[filtered categories]]), especially the directed set $(\mathbb{N},\leq)$ of [[natural numbers]]; see [[directed colimit]] (or [[filtered colimit]]) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.
