A __direct limit__ is the same thing as a [[colimit]], which was often used before the categorical terminology started to become 'standardised'. It is still used in certain areas of mathematics.  (Similarly, an [[inverse limit]] is  the same thing as a [[limit]].)  In this context, a __direct system__ is the same thing as a [[diagram]], and a __direct cone__ is the same thing as a [[cocone]].

Many authors restrict this terminology to limits over [[directed sets]] (or [[filtered categories]]); see __[[directed colimit]]__ (or __[[filtered colimit]]__) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want, or see __[[colimit]]__ for the more general notion.  Especially common is the directed set $(\mathbb{N},\leq)$ of [[natural numbers]], in which case the direct system may be called a __direct sequence__.
