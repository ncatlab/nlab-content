## Idea ##

**Writhe** is a measure of how much a knot or link _writhes_ around itself.  As a 1-dimensional line cannot actually twist, this is not a [[knot invariant]] but is an invariant of [[framed knots]] (and links).  Since a [[link diagram]] can be given a natural framing (the _blackboard framing_), it is possible to compute the writhe of a specific diagram.  One place where this is used very neatly is to convert the [[Kauffman bracket]], which is an invariant of framed links, into the [[Jones polynomial]], being an invariant of ordinary links.

## Definition ##

Recall that a [[framed link]] can be thought of as a link together with a normal direction along each component, which we call the _framing direction_.

+-- {: .num_definition #writhe}
###### Definition
The **writhe** of a framed link is the [[linking number]] of the link with its infinitesimal displacement in the framing direction.

For an oriented link diagram, the writhe is defined using the orientation of the crossings.

+-- {: .num_definition #writediag}
###### Definition
The **writhe** of an oriented [[link diagram]] is defined to be the sum of the orientations of its crossings.
