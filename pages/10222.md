## Idea

A _partition_ is any of various ways of dividing a mathematical object into nontrivial _parts_ that (in some sense) cover the object while being mutually disjoint.


## Definitions

Some or all of the following definitions may well be special cases of a general concept, but I don\'t know a general definition.


### Of sets

Given a [[set]] $S$, a __partition__ of $S$ is a collection $\pi$ of [[inhabited subsets]] of $S$ such that
*  For $A, B \in \pi$, if $A \cap B$ is inhabited, then $A = B$;
*  The [[union]] $\bigcup \pi$ is all of $S$ (the [[improper subset]]).

A partition $\pi$ __refines__ a partition $\rho$ (of the same set) if every set in $\pi$ is contained in some set in $\rho$:
$$ \forall A \in \pi,\; \exists B \in \rho,\; A \subseteq B .$$
Refinement is a [[partial order]] on the class of partitions of $S$.

Partitions of $S$ are in [[bijective correspondence]] with [[equivalence relations]] on $S$; a partition is precisely a collection of [[equivalence classes]].  Refinement corresponds to implication between relations.


### Of numbers

Given a [[natural number]] $n$, a __composition__ of $n$ is a [[list]] of positive natural numbers whose sum is $n$, and a __partition__ of $n$ is an unordered list, or [[multiset]], or such numbers.  (That is, different compositions define the same partition if the compositions differ only by order.)  A partition may also be defined as a [[monotone function|monotone]] composition.

Every [[natural number]] $n$ corresponds to a [[finite set]] $[n]$, and every partition of $[n]$ (as defined above) gives a partition of $n$, but different partitions of $[n]$ may give the same partition of $n$.  Conversely, a composition of $n$ defines a partition of $[n]$, but not every partition of $[n]$ arises in this way.

More precisely, we have the following, where $\rightarrowtail$ indicates an [[injection]] and $\twoheadrightarrow$ indicates a [[surjection]]:
$$ Comp(n) \rightarrowtail Part([n]) \twoheadrightarrow Part(n) ;$$
the [[composite]] of this is also a surjection, which is [[split surjection|split]] by the definition of a partition as a monotone composition.

The __partition function__ $p$ gives the number of partitions of $n$ as a [[function]] of $n$; this is [OEIS A000041](https://oeis.org/A000041).  Its (ordinary) [[generating function]] is
$$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n) x^n = \prod_{k=1}^\infty (1 - x^k)^{-1} .$$
Partitions are often described using [[Young diagram]]s.

One may also speak of __multiplicative__ compositions and partitions of $n$ for positive $n$ (where the above are _additive_), also called (ordered and unordered) __factorizations__; these are (ordered and unordered) lists of natural numbers greater than $1$ whose product is $n$.  This immediately generalizes to other [[monoids]] (or [[semigroups]], leaving out the [[empty list]]).


### Of intervals

Given [[real numbers]] $a$ and $b$, a __partition__ $\pi$ of the [[interval]] $[a,b]$ is an inhabited finite [[list]] $c_0, \ldots, c_n$ such that:
* $c_0 = a$,
* $c_i \leq c_{i+1}$ for $i \lt n$,
* $c_n = b$.

A partition $\pi$ __refines__ a partition $\rho$ if every element of the list $\rho$ belongs to the list $\pi$.  The __mesh__ (or __norm__) of $\pi$ is
$$ {\|\pi\|} \coloneqq \max_i (c_{i+1} - c_i) .$$
A __tag__ of $\pi$ is a list $t_0, \ldots, t_{n-1}$ such that $c_i \leq t_i \leq c_{i+1}$ for $i \lt n$.  Tagged partitions are used to define the [[Riemann integral]], the [[Darboux integral]], and the [[gauge integral]].


### Of measure spaces

Given a [[measure space]] $S$ (or more generally a [[measurable space]] equipped with a notion of [[null sets]]), a __partition__ of $S$ is a collection $\pi$ of [[positive subset|positive]] (non-null) [[measurable subsets]] of $S$, such that:
*  For $A, B \in \pi$, if $A \cap B$ is positive, then $A$ and $B$ are equivalent;
*  The [[union]] $\bigcup \pi$ is [[full subset|full]].

Then a partition of a set is simply a partition of the measure space given by [[counting measure]].

Partitions in this sense can be used to define the [[Lebesgue integral]] in analogy to the definition of the Riemann integral using partitions of intervals.
