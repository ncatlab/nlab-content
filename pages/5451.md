## Idea

The _geometric [[homotopy group]]s_ of a [[Lie groupoid]] $X$ are those of its [[nLab:geometric realization]] $|X|$ when regarded as a [[simplicial manifold]]. Equivalently, regarding $X$ as an object in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞LieGrpd]], its homotopy groups are those of the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] $\Pi(X) \in $ [[∞Grpd]].
 
## Definition

For $X = (X_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} X_0)$ a [[Lie groupoid]] and $x : * \to X$ a [[point]], let 

$$
  X_\bullet = 
  \left(
    \cdots
    X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 
   \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} X_0
  \right)
$$

be its [[nerve]] regarded as a [[simplicial manifold]].

###### Remark

When regarding each manifold $X_n$ as a [[diffeological space]], hence a [[sheaf]] on the [[site]] [[CartSp]] then $X_\bullet in PSh(CartSp)^{\Delta^{op}} \simeq [CartSp^{op},sSet]$ is the [[simplicial presheaf]] on [[CartSp]] that presents $X$ as an object in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞LieGrpd]] of [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Regard $X_\bullet$ as a [[simplicial topological space]] by forgetting the [[smooth structure]]. Write $|X_\bullet| \in $ [[Top]] for its [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces|geometric realization as a simplicial topological space]].

The **geometric homotopy groups** of $X$ are defined to be the ordinary [[homotopy group]]s of the [[topological space]] $|X_\bullet|$:

$$
  \pi_n(X,x) := \pi_n(|X_\bullet|,x)
  \,.
$$


=--

In this form the definition originates in ([Segal](#Segal)).


## Prperties

Regard $X$ as an [[∞-Lie groupoid]] under the natural embedding $LieGrpd \hookrightarrow \infty LieGrpd$. By the discussion at [[∞LieGrpd]] this is a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]], which means that its terminal [[geometric morphism]] comes with a further [[left adjoint]] $\Pi$

$$
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : \infty LieGrpd \to \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

We say that $\Pi(X) \in \infty Grpd \simeq Top$ is the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] of $X$.

###### Observation

The geometric homotopy groups of $X$ are those of $\Pi(X) \in Top$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By the discussion at [[∞-Lie groupoid]] we have precisely that $\Pi(X)$ is presented by the [[geometric realization]] of the [[simplicial topological space]] underlying the [[nerve]] of $X$.
