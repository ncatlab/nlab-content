#Idea#

In as far as the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ (a [[simplicial set]]) is a combinatorial model for the $n$-ball, its _boundary_ $\partial \Delta^n$ is a combinatorial model for the $(n-1)$-sphere.

#Definition#

The **boundary** $\partial \Delta^n$ of the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ is the simplicial set _generated_ from the simplicial set $\Delta^n$ minus its unique non-degenerate cell in dimension $n$.

There is a canonical [[monomorphism]]

$$
  i_n : \partial \Delta^n \hookrightarrow \Delta^n
  \,,
$$

the _boundary inclusion_ .

The [[geometric realization]] of this is the inclusion of the $(n-1)$-sphere as the boundary of the $n$-disk.

Simplicial boundary inclusions are one part of the [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrant generation]] of the classical [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

#Remarks#

* the closely relted concept is that of [[horn]].
