## Idea

A _synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoid_ is an [[∞-groupoid]] equipped with a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive structure]] that subsumes that of [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s as well as of [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] $\infty$-groupoids: [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s.

In the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoids the canonical [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{\Pi}(X)$ factors through a version relative to [[Smooth∞Grpd]]: the [[infinitesimal singular simplicial complex|infinitesimal path ∞-functor]] $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$. In traditional terms this is the object modeled by the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] and the [[de Rham space]] of $X$. The [[quasicoherent ∞-stack]]s on $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ are [[D-module]]s on $X$.


## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Let [[CartSp]]${}_{synthdiff}$ be the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[smooth loci]] on the objects of the form $\mathbb{R}^n \times D$ that are [[product]]s of a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and an [[infinitesimally thickened point]] $D$.

Equip this category with the [[coverage]] where a family of morphisms  is [[covering]] precisely if it is of the form $\{U_i \times D \stackrel{(f_i, Id_D)}{\to} U \times D\}$ for $\{f_i : U_i \to U\}$ a covering in [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$ (a [[good open cover]]).

=--

This appears as ([Kock, (5.1)]{#Kock}). 


+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

The [[sheaf topos]] over [[CartSp]]${}_{synthdiff}$ is ([[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to) the [[topos]] known as the [[Cahiers topos]], a [[smooth topos]] that constitutes a [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|well adapted model]] for [[synthetic differential geometry]].

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

We say the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of **synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoids** is the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]]

$$
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{synthdiff})
$$

on $CartSp_{synthdiff}$.

###### Proposition

The functor $i^*$ given by restriction along $i$ exhibits 
$SynthDiff\infty Grpd$ as an 
<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+(infinity%2C1)-topos#LieTheory">infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood</a>
of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s in that we have a quadruple of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s

$$
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
  :
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

such that $i_!$ is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]].

=--



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localized]] at the [[covering]] [[sieve]] inclusions 

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{synthdiff}) \simeq
  ([CartSp_{synthdiff}^{op}, sSet]_{loc})^\circ
$$

(as discussed at [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes|models for (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-toposes]]).


Notice that the functor $i$ has a [[right adjoint]] given by

$$
  p : (K \times D) \mapsto D
  \,,
$$

that exhibits a [[coreflective subcategory]]

$$
  (i \dashv p) : CartSp_{synthdiff}
    \stackrel{\overset{i}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{p}{\to}}
   CartSp_{smooth}
  \,.
$$


Consider the right [[Kan extension]] $Ran_i : [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet] \to [CartSp_{synthdiff}^{op},sSet]$ of [[simplicial presheaves]] along the functor $i$. On an object $K \times D \in CartSp_{synthdiff}$ it is given by 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Ran_{i} F : K \times D 
    & \mapsto {\lim_\leftarrow}_{\{U \to K \times D\}} F(U)
    \\
    & \simeq {\lim_\leftarrow}_{\{U \to K\} } F(U)
    \\
    & \simeq F(K)
    \\
    & \simeq F(p(K \times D))
    \\
    & =: (p^* F)(K \times D)
   \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where the [[limit]]s are over the [[opposite category|opposite]] [[comma categories]] $(i/(K \times D))^{op}$ and $(Id_{CartSp_{smooth}}/K)^{op}$, respectively, and where we are using in the first step that there is a unique terminal morphism from $K \in CartSp_{smooth}$ to the [[infinitesimally thickened point]] $D$ and in the second step the [[Yoneda reduction]]-form of the [[Yoneda lemma]]. The rest is notation.

This shows that the right adjoint to $(-)\circ i$ is itself given by precomposition with a functor, and hence has itself a further right adjoint, which gives us a total of four [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]  
    \stackrel{\overset{Lan_i}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}{\underset{Ran_p}{\leftarrow}}}}
  [CartSp_{synthdiff}^{op}, sSet]
  \,.
$$


From this are directly induced the corresponding [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]]s on the global projective and injective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  (Lan_i \dashv (-) \circ i) : 
  [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
   \stackrel{\overset{Lan_i}{\to}}{\underset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}
  [CartSp_{synthdiff}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,;
$$

$$
  ((-)\circ i \dashv (-) \circ p) : 
  [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
   \stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ i}{\leftarrow}}
    {\underset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}
  [CartSp_{synthdiff}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}
  \,;
$$

$$
  ((-) \circ p \dashv Ran_p) : 
  [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{inj}
   \stackrel{\overset{(-)\circ p}{\to}}{\underset{Ran_p}{\leftarrow}}
  [CartSp_{synthdiff}^{op}, sSet]_{inj}
  \,.
$$



By the discussion at [[simplicial Quillen adjunction]] for these Quillen adjunctions to descent to the Cech-local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] it suffices that the [[right adjoint]]s preserve locally fibrant objects. By the properties of [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] this in turn is implied if  the [[left adjoint]]s preserve [[covering]]s. 

This is clearly the case for $(-) \circ i$ by the very definition of the site structure on [[CartSp]]${}_{synthdiff}$:

$$
  (-) \circ i : \{U_i \times D \stackrel{(f_i,Id_D)}{\to} U \times D\}
    \mapsto
      \{U_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} U\}
   \,.
$$

It is also directly seen to be the case for $Lan_i$, which on representables is given by $i$ itself:

$$
  Lan_i U : (K \times D) \mapsto \int^{U \in CartSp_{smooth}}
    CartSp_{synthdiff}(K \times D, U) \cdot U
    = U \in [CartSp_{synthdiff}, sSet]
$$

and hence sends

$$
  Lan_i : \{U_i \to U\} \mapsto \{U_i \to U\}
  \,.
$$


It follows that $i^* : SynthDiff \infty Grpd \to Smooth \infty Grpd$ is given by the left [[derived functor]] of restriction along $i$, and 
$i_* : Smooth \infty Grpd \to SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ is given by the right [[derived functor]] of restriction along $p$. 

Finally to see that $(-) \circ p$ preserves covers notice that for every covering family $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $CartSp_{smooth}$ and every morphism $K \times D \to p^* U$ in $CartSp_{synthdiff}$ we may find a covering $\{K_{j} \times D \to K \times D\}$ of $K \times D$ such that we find commuting diagrams

$$
  \array{
    K_j \times D &\to& p^* U_{i(j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    K \times D &\to& p^* U
  }
  \,.
$$

This is because by the [[Yoneda lemma]] and the definition of $p^* = (-) \circ p$ a morphism $K \times D \to p^* U$ is equivalently a morphism $K \to U$. For such morphisms diagrams as above can be found by the definition of [[coverage]].

This implies that $\{p^* U_i \to p^* U\}$ is a _generalized cover_ in the terminology at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], which by the discussion there implies that the corresponding [[Cech nerve]] equivalent to the [[sieve]] inclusion is a weak equivalence.

This establishes the quadruple of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s as claimed.



=--


+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Conversely this implies that $SynthDiff\infty Grpd$ is a [[strongly ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] over [[Smooth∞Grpd]], exhibited by the triple of adjunctions

$$
  (i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!) : 
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd \to Smooth \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

## Structures

We discuss the realization of the general abstract <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+(infinity%2C1)-topos#Structures">structures in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos</a> in $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$.

Since by the [above discussion](#RelativeInftyConnectedness) $SynthDiff\infty Grpd$ is strongly $\infty$-connected _relative_ to [[Smooth∞Grpd]] all of these structures that depend only on $\infty$-connectedness (and not on [[local (∞,1)-topos|locality]]) acquire a relative version.

###### Observation

For $U \times D \in CartSp_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SynthDiff\infty Grpd$
we have that

$$
  \mathbf{Red}(K \times D) \simeq U
$$

is the **reduced smooth locus** the formal dual of the [[smooth algebra]] obtained by quotienting out all nilpotent elements in the [[smooth algebra]] $C^\infty(K \times D) \simeq C^\infty(K) \otimes C^\infty(D)$.

By the [[model category]] presentation of $\mathbf{Red} = i \circ \Pi_{inf} = i_! \circ i^*$ of the [above proof](#CohesivenessUnderSmoothInfGrpd) and using that every [[representable functor|representable]] is cofibrant and fibrant in the local projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{Red}(U \times D)
    & 
    \simeq
     (\mathbb{L}i_!) (\mathbb{R}i^*) (U \times D)
    \\
     &\simeq
     (\mathbb{L}i_!) i^* (U \times D)

For $X \in SmoothAlg^{op}  \to SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ a [[smooth locus]], we have that $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$ is the corresponding [[de Rham space]], the [[∞-stack]] on $CartSp_{synthdiff}$ in which all [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] neighbour points in $X$ are equivalent: given by the assignment
