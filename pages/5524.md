## Definition

Let $C := $[[ThCartSp]] be the [[site]] of infintiesimally thickened [[Cartesian space]]s and [[smooth function]]s between them, equipped with the [[coverage]] of [[good open cover]]s on the finite factors. (A site of definition of the [[Cahiers topos]].)

Write

$$
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(ThCartSp)
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $ThCartSp$. 

Since $ThCartSp$ is an [[∞-cohesive site]], this is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. We may think of its (concrete) objects as being [[∞-groupoid]]s equipped with [[smooth structure]] in the fashion of [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|standard models]] of [[synthetic differential geometry]].

Therefore we call an object in $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ a **synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoid**.

By restriction along the morphism of sites [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}\to$[[CartSp]]${}_{synthdiff}$ every synthetic differential $\infty$-groupoid has an underlying [[smooth ∞-groupoid]].


## Properites


The [[(n,1)-topos|(1,1)-topos]] $\tau_{\leq 0} SynthDiff\infty Grpd\hookrightarrow SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ of 0-[[truncated]] objects is the [[Cahiers topos]].

###### Proposition

The morphism of [[site]]s

$$
  CartSp_{smooth} \stackrel{\overset{}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  CartSp_{synthdiff}
$$

is a [[reflective subcategory|coreflective embedding]] and exhibits $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ as being a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] over [[Smooth∞Grpd]]

$$
 (\Pi_{inf} \dashv Disc_{inf} \dashv \Gamma_{inf})
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{inf}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{inf}}{\to}}}
  Smooth \infty Grpd
  \,.

This induces the following infinitesimal analogs of the structures in $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$.

  (LConst_{inf} \circ \Pi_{inf} \dashv LConst_{inf} \circ \Gamma_{inf})
  :
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  SynthDiff \infty Grpd
$$

for the composite [[adjunction]]. For $X,A \in SynthDiff\infty Grpd$ we call $\mathbf{\Pi}$.

For $X \in \infty Grpd$ we write $\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf,dR}(X)$ for the [[homotopy cofiber]] of the unit $X \to \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X)$, i.e. for the [[pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf,dR}(X)
  }
$$

in $SynthDiff \infty Grpd$.

For $* \to A \in SynthDiff \infty Grpd$ a [[pointed object]], we write $\mathbf{\flat}_{inf,dR} A$ for the [[homotopy fiber]] of the counit $\mathbf{\flat}_{inf} A \to A$, i.e. for the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{\flat}_{inf,dR}A &\to& \mathbf{\flat}_{inf} A
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow

###### Definition


We say a morphism of [[nLab:site]]s $i : C \to C_{th} $ is an
**infinitesimal thickening** of $C$ if it exhibits $C$ as a  [[nLab:reflective subcategory|corefelctive subcategory]] of $C_{th}$, i.e. if 

* $i : C \to C_{th}$ is a [[nLab:full and faithful functor]]

* there exists a [[nLab:right adjoint]] $p : C_{th} \to C$ 

  $$
    (i \dashv p)
    : 
    C \stackrel{\overset{p}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
    C_{th}
  $$

and if $p$ preserves covering families.
 
=--

Notice that this implies in particular that the unit of the adjunction is a natural isomorphism

$$
  U \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} p(i(U)) 
  \,,
$$

natural in $U \in C$.

The adjunction formalizes the idea that an [[nLab:infinitesimal object]] has a unique ordinary point: if $U$ is an object without infinitesimal extension and $U \times D$ an infinitesimal thickening of it in that $p(U\times D) = U$, then for $V$ any other object without infinitesimal extension, morphisms $V \to U \times D$ are the same as morphisms $V \to U$, because all morphisms $V \to D$ from the finite to the infinitesimal object have to factor through the unique point $* \to D$. This is what the adjunciton in the above definition asserts.



+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example


Let $C =$ [[nLab:CartSp]] be the category of [[nLab:Cartesian space]]s equipped with the [[nLab:good open cover]] [[nLab:coverage]].

Let $C_{th} := $ [[nLab:ThCartSp]] be the category of thickened Cartesian spaces, the [[nLab:full subcategory]] of [[nLab:smooth loci]] on those of the form $\mathbb{R}^n \times \ell W$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $W$ a Weil algebra in the sense of [[nLab:synthetic differential geometry]].

Let $C_{th}$ be equipped with the [[nLab:coverage]] whose [[nLab:covering]] families are products $\{U_i \times \ell W \to U \times \ell W\}$ of a [[nLab:good open cover]] $\{U_i \to U\}$ of a [[nLab:Cartesian space]] $U$ with an [[nLab:infinitesimal space]] $\ell W$.

Let $i : CartSp \hookrightarrow ThCartSp $ be the canonical embedding. This is evidently a [[nLab:full and faithful functor]] that preserves covers. The projection $p : U \times \ell W \mapsto U$ for $U \in CartSp$ extends to a projection functor $p : ThCartSp \to CartSp$. This is evidently surjective on objects.

Notice that the characteristic feature of the [[nLab:infinitesimal space]]s $\ell W$ is that for any $U \in CartSp$ we have

$$
  Hom_{ThCartSp}(i(U), \ell W) = \{U \to * \to \ell W\}
  \,.
$$

It follows that for $U,V \in CartSp$ and $\ell W$ an infinitesimal space that

$$
  Hom_{ThCartSp}(U, V \times \ell W)
  =
  Hom_{ThCartSp}(U,V)
  = 
  Hom_{CartSp}(U,V)
  =
  Hom_{CartSp}(U, p(V \times \ell W))
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

For $i : C \to C_{th}$ an infinitesimal thickening of [[nLab:site]]s, we say that the corresponding [[nLab:geometric morphism]] of [[nLab:(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[nLab:(∞,1)-topos]]es

$$ 
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th}) \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
$$

exhibits $\mathbf{H}_{th} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})$ as an **infinitesimal thickening** of $\mathbf{H}_{red} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$. 

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Infinitesimal thickenings of $(\infty,1)$-toposes are [[nLab:essential geometric morphism]]s:

$$
  (\Pi_{inf} \dashv LConst_{inf} \dashv \Gamma_{inf})
  :
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C_{th})
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


As before, we present the $(\infty,1)$-toposes in question by the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+simplicial+presheaves#LocalizationAtCoverage">Left Bousfield localization at the coverage</a> $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}$ of the global projective [[nLab:model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

We start by _defining_ 

$$
  LConst_{inf} := (-) \circ p : [C^{op}, sSet] \to [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]
$$ 

as given by precomposition with $p : C_{th} \to C$. To see that this is correct, we check that its [[nLab:right adjoint]] is indeed the functor 

$$
  \Gamma_{inf} = (-)\circ i : [C^{op}_{th}, sSet] \to [C^{op}, sSet]
$$

given by precomposition with $i$, i.e. indeed the [[nLab:direct image]] induced by the morphism of sites given by $i$.

To check this, use that this right adjoint is given by the right [[nLab:Kan extension]] $Ran_p$ along $p$

$$
  Ran_p F : U \mapsto 
  {\lim_{\leftarrow}}_{(p(V_{th}) \to U) \in (p\downarrow U)} F(V_{th})
  \,,
$$

where the [[nLab:limit]] is taken over the [[nLab:comma category]].

Now we observe that by the fact that $(i \dashv p)$ is a [[nLab:reflective subcategory|coreflective embedding]] the inclusion functor

$$
  inc : C/U = (Id_C \downarrow U) \to (p \downarrow U)
$$

of the [[nLab:overcategory]] into the [[nLab:comma category]] given by

$$
  inc : (W \to U) \mapsto ( p(i(W)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} W \to U)
$$

is a [[nLab:final functor]]: for all $p(V_{th}) \to U$ in $p\downarrow U$ the [[nLab:comma category]] $(p(V_{th} \to U)) \downarrow inc$ is evidently non-emty (it contains the object given by the counit $p(V_{th}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} p i p (V_{th})  $ ) and connected: for any two objects 

$$
  \array{
     p(i(W_1)) &\leftarrow& p(V_{th}) &\to& p(i(W_2))
     \\
     &\searrow& \downarrow & \swarrow
     \\
     && U
  }
$$

a connecting zig-zag can be taken to be

$$
  \array{
     && p i p (V_{th})
     \\
     & \swarrow &\uparrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}& \searrow
     \\
     p(i(W_1)) &\leftarrow& p(V_{th}) &\to& p(i(W_2))
     \\
     &\searrow& \downarrow & \swarrow
     \\
     && U
  }
  \,.
$$

By the basic characteristic of [[nLab:final functor]]s, it follows that the [[nLab:limit]] over $(p \downarrow U)$ that constructs the right Kan extension $Ran_p F$ at $U \in C$ is equivalently computed by its restriction along $inc$ as

$$
  (Ran_p F)(U)
  \simeq
  {\lim_{\leftarrow}}_{(W \to U) \in C/U} F(W)
  \,.
$$

But this is the formula for right Kan extension along the identity, so we have

$$
  (Ran_p F)(U) = F(U)
$$

(this is [[nLab:Yoneda reduction]]). So $Ran_p = (-) \circ i$ is simply given by restricting along $i$, which is the [[nLab:direct image]] operation inuced by the morphism of sites $i : C \to C_{th}$.

So far we have established 

$$
  (LConst_{inf} \dashv \Gamma_{inf})
  =
  ((-) \circ p \dashv (-) \circ i)
  :
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}
  [C^{op}, sSet]
  \,.
$$


The functor $\Gamma_{inf}$ trivially preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations of $[C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$, hence $LConst_{inf}$ preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations of $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$. Since moreover $C \hookrightarrow C_{th}$ preserves covering families, $\Gamma_{inf}$ sends fibrant objects in $[C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}$ to fibrant objects in $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}$. Once again with [[nLab:Quillen adjunction|HTT, corollary A.3.7.2]] this implies that we have a [[nLab:Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  (LConst_{inf} \dashv \Gamma_{inf})
  :
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov} 
    \stackrel{\overset{LConst_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{inf}}{\to}}
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov} 
    \,.
$$

Now consider the [[nLab:left adjoint]] of $LConst_{inf}$ given by left [[nLab:Kan extension]] along $p$

$$
  \Pi_{inf} = Lan_p : [C_{th}^{op}, sSet] \to [C^{op}, sSet]
  \,.
$$

which we write in [[nLab:coend]] notation as

$$
  Lan_p A : U \mapsto 
  \int^{V_{th} \in C_{th}}
   Hom_{C}(U, p(V_{th})) \cdot A(V_{th})
  \,.
$$

With the [[nLab:co-Yoneda lemma]] we see that $\Pi_{inf}$ takes all the representable presheaves from $C_{th}$ to their underlying objects in $C$: it contracts away all the infinitesimal extensions of representable present in a simplicial presheaf on $C_{th}$ (just as the finite path $\infty$-groupoid functor $\Pi$ contracted away entirely the representables inside a simplicial presheaf).


It is clear that $LConst_{inf}$ preserves fibrations and global acyclic fibrations in $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$, so $\Pi_{inf}$ preserves cofibations in $[C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ and therefore in $[C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj, cov}$.

By the assumption that also $p$ preserves covering families, it follows that
$LConst_{inf}$ also sends fibrant objects of $[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}$ to fibrant objects in $[C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}$. So one more time with [[nLab:Quillen adjunction|HTT, corollary A.3.7.2]] it follows that we also have a [[nLab:Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  (\Pi_{inf} \dashv LConst_{inf})
  : 
  [C_{th}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{inf}}{\to}}{\underset{LConst_{inf}}{\leftarrow}}
  [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,cov}
  \,.
$$


=--


+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

From the above proof and since in $sPSh(C)$ [[nLab:commutativity of limits and colimits|colimits commute with products]], we have that for $j(U \times \mathbb{L}W)$ a representable presheaf in $sPSh(CartSp_{th})$ that

$$
  \Pi_{inf}(j(U \times \mathbb{L}W))
  = j(U) \times (colim_{CartSp_{th}} j(\mathbb{L}W))
  = j(U)
  \,,
$$

using again that the colimit over a representable functor is the point. This means that on a Dugger-cofibrant replacement in $sPSh(CartSp_{th})$ of some object $X$ as a degreewise coproduct of representables

$$
  X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}
  \hat X 
  :=
  \int^{[n]}
  \Delta[n]
  \cdot
  \coprod_{i_n} U_{i_n} \times \mathbb{L}W_{i_n}
$$

the functor $\Pi_{inf}$ acts by discarding all the infinitesimal thickenings:

$$
  \Pi_{inf} \hat X
  Red(\hat X)
  :=
  \int^{[n]}
  \Delta[n]
  \cdot
  \coprod_{i_n} U_{i_n} 
  \,.
$$

In particular this is hence the action of the $\infty$-categorical left [[nLab:derived functor|derived]] functor of $\Pi_{inf}$

* $\Pi$ contracts all contractible local parts of $X$ to the point;

* $\Pi_{inf}$ contracts all _infinitesimal_ local parts of $X$ to the point.
