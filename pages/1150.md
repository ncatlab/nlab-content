## Definition

In the most general sense, a **bundle** over an [[object]] $B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is simply an object $E$ of $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ from $E$ to $B$:
$$ \array { E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} \\ B } $$

One often refers to such a bundle simply as $E$, even though $p$ is really part of the data.

For $x \in B$ a [[generalized element]] of $B$, the [[fiber]] $E_x$ of the bundle over $x$ is the [[pullback]] $x^* E$.


## Bundles with extra structure and properties

One generally considers bundles with extra properties or structure:


* [[fiber bundle]],

* [[microbundle]]

* [[principal bundle]]

* [[vector bundle]],

* [[connection on a bundle|bundle with connection]]

  * [[Simons-Sullivan structured bundle]]

* etc.

## The collection of all bundles

The category of bundles over a given object $B$ is the [[over category]] $\mathcal{C}/B$. The collection of all bundles in a given [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ therefore arranges itself into the [[codomain fibration]] $cod : [I,\mathcal{C}] \to \mathcal{C}$. As such, the [[descent]] for bundles may be expressed as [[monadic descent]] with respect to the codomain [[bifibration]]. This does in general not work inside one of the more restrictive subcategories of bundles with extra structure and property, as the push-forward operation typically does not respect these extra conditions. For more on this see [monadic descent of bundles](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monadic+descent#ForCodomainFibs).

## Relation to other concepts

* Bundles tend to have [[sheaf|sheaves]] of local [[section]]s.

* In [[physics]], [[gauge field]]s may be described in terms of [[connection on a bundle|bundles with connection]].
