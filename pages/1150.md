In the most general sense, a **bundle** over an [[object]] $B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is simply an object $E$ of $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ from $E$ to $B$:
$$ \array { E \\ \downarrow p \\ B } $$
We usually refer to such a bundle simply as $E$, even though $p$ is really part of the data.

The category of bundles over a given object $B$ is the [[over category]] $\mathcal{C}/B$.

One generally considers bundles with extra properties or structure:
* [[fiber bundle|fiber bundles]],
* [[vector bundle|vector bundles]],
* bundles with [[connection]],
* etc.

In [[physics]], physical fields are described using bundles.

Bundles tend to have [[sheaf|sheaves]] of local [[section]]s.
