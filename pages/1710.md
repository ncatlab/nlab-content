+--{.query}

_Eric_: Let's list here a library of notation for the uninitiated (like me).

_Toby_:  If you like, but what we really need to do, I think, is to explain notation right where it\'s used.  So if you put a query box pointing out wherever notation is used that you don\'t understand, then that might help.
