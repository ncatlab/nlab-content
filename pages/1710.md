_Eric_: Let's list here a library of notation for the uninitiated (like me).

_Toby_:  If you like, but what we really need to do, I think, is to explain notation right where it\'s used.  So if you put a query box pointing out wherever notation is used that you don\'t understand, then that might help.

_Eric_: Sure, but sometimes I come across notation in a reference (not necessarily on the n-Lab) and it is not 100% clear from the context what concept that notation corresponds to. I thought this could be an index of notation that merely points to the correct page. 

_Toby_:  OK, fair enough.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: yes, sounds good
