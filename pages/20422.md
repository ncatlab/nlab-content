## Idea

Given a [[vertex operator algebra]] $\mathcal{V}$ ([[VOA]]) or [[super vertex operator algebra]] ([[sVOA]]), or more generally a full [[2d CFT]] (of which the [[VOA]] is the local and chiral data) or [[2d SCFT]] (hence a "[[2-spectral triple]]") one may ask (as for any [[object]] in any [[category]]) for its [[automorphisms]], hence the [[homomorphisms]] 

$$
  \mathcal{V} 
   \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{V}
$$

in the corresponding [[category]] of sVOA-s/[[2d SCFTs]], from $\mathcal{V}$ to itself, which are [[invertible morphism|invertible]] and hence constitute a _[[symmetry]]_ of $\mathcal{V}$.

## In perturbative string vacua and Connes-Lott models

If $\mathcal{V}$ is a [[direct sum|direct summand]] of a [[2d CFT]]/[[2-spectral triple]] encoding a [[perturbative string theory vacuum]], such as, typically, a [[rational 2d CFT]] such as a [[Gepner model]] encoding a "non-geometric" [[KK-compactification]], then the automorphisms of $\mathcal{V}$ are the [[formal dual|formal duals]] to [[symmetries]] of that [[KK-compactification]]-[[fiber]] space.

In the point-particle limit where the [[2d SCFT]]/[[2-spectral triple]]  becomes an ordinary [[spectral triple]] (see [there](2-spectral+triple#References)) this hence reduces to the automorphisms of internal algebras as discussed in [[Connes-Lott-Chamseddine-Barrett models]].

## Examples

### Moonshine

[[moonshine]]-examples:

* The [[Conway group]] $C_{O_0}$ is the [[automorphism group|group of]] [[automorphsims of a super VOA]] of the unique chiral [[number of supersymmetries|N=1]] [[super vertex operator algebra]] of [[central charge]] $c = 12$ without fields of [[conformal weight]] $1/2$
