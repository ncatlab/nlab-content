Given a [[ringed site]] $(X,O_X)$ a __quasicoherent sheaf of $O_X$-modules__ is a sheaf $\mathcal{M}$ of $O_X$-modules such that there is a cover $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ of $X$ by open sets such that for every $\alpha$ there exist $I_\alpha$ and $J_\alpha$ and an exact sequence of sheaves of $O_X$-modules of the form
$$
O_X^{I_\alpha}|_{U_\alpha}\to
O_X^{J_\alpha}|_{U_\alpha}\to
\mathcal{M}|_{U_\alpha}\to 0,
$$
which should be viewed as a local presentation of $\mathcal{M}$.
