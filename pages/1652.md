## Idea

A [[topological space]] $X$ is _(semi-)locally simply connected_ if every [[neighborhood]] of a point has a subneighbourhood in which [[loops]] based at the point in the subneighborhood can be contracted in $X$. It is similar to but weaker than the condition that every neighborhood of a point has a subneighborhood that is [[simply connected]]. This latter condition is called _local simple-connectedness_. 

## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **semi-locally simply-connected** if it has a basis of [[neighbourhood]]s $U$ such that the inclusion $\Pi_1(U) \to \Pi_1(X)$ of [[fundamental groupoid]]s factors through the canonical functor $\Pi_1(U) \to codisc(U)$ to the [[codiscrete groupoid]] whose objects are the elements of $U$. The condition on $U$ is equivalent to the condition that the homomorphism $\pi_1(U, x) \to \pi_1(X, x)$ of [[fundamental group]]s induced by inclusion $U \subseteq X$ is trivial. 

* A semi-locally simply connected space need not be locally simply connected. For a simple counterexample, take the cone on the [[Hawaiian earring space]]. 

## Application 

Semi-local simple connectedness is the crucial condition needed to have a good theory of [[covering space]]s, to the effect that the topos of permutation representations of the fundamental groupoid of $X$ is equivalent to the category of covering spaces of $X$. 

## In topos theory
