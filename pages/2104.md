## Idea

An interesting subclass of [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] is thought to arise from [[prequantum field theory]] via a process called _quantization_.   This process reads in certain -- usually [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] -- data, interprets this data as specifying the dynamics of some [[physical system]], and spits out the [[quantum field theory]] that encodes the time evolution of this system.

Historically, it was an approximation to the true time evolution that was originally found and studied, by Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and others. This is now known as "[[classical physics]]". The true dynamics in turn is "[[quantum physics]]".

In view of this, quantization is often understood as a [[retraction|right inverse]] to the procedure that sends the full quantum dynamics to its [[classical limit]]. As such it is not well defined, i.e. unique, when it exists. Additional structures sometimes make it unique. 

> The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of [[quantization]].
