## Idea

An interesting subclass of [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] is thought to arise from [[prequantum field theory]] via a process called _quantization_.   This process reads in certain -- usually [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] -- data, interprets this data as specifying the dynamics of some [[physical system]], and spits out the [[quantum field theory]] that encodes the time evolution of this system.

Historically, it was an approximation to the true time evolution that was originally found and studied, by Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and others. This is now known as "[[classical physics]]". The true dynamics in turn is "[[quantum physics]]".

In view of this, quantization is often understood as a [[retraction|right inverse]] to the procedure that sends the full quantum dynamics to its [[classical limit]]. As such it is not well defined, i.e. unique, when it exists. Additional structures sometimes make it unique. 

[[!include deformation quantization - table]]


There have been found some formalizations of a at least some aspects of quantization, notably there is _[[algebraic deformation quantization]]_ and _[[geometric quantization]]_. 

[[!include Isbell duality - table]]

In their traditional formulation these formulation are geared towards [[mechanics]] (as opposed to [[field theory]]). Even in that restricted application, it seems that a more comprehensive understandin is still missing

> The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of [[quantization]].

In the context of [[field theory]] the conceptual issues become more severe even. For example the class of [[field theories]] called _[[Yang-Mills theory]]_ is a core ingredient in the [[standard model of particle physics]] but the _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_ (see there for more) poses famous open problems -- of which of course that there isn't yet a comprehensive theory of what this even means is not the least.

## Quantization as an index map
 {#QuantizationAsAnIndexMap}

Here we survey aspects of quantization at least in aspects is or at least is similar to an _[[index]]_ map, hence a [[push-forward in generalized cohomology]]. More on this is in ([Nuiten 13](#Nuiten13)).

The general pattern here is this:

* The [[kinetic action]] part of the [[action functional]] of a [[prequantum field theory]] is really part of the [[measure]]/[[orientation in generalized cohomology]] on the [[moduli space]] of [[field (physics)|fields]]

* The (gauge coupling-)[[interaction]] in the [[action functional]] of a [[prequantum field theory]] induces a [[cocycle]] in some [[cohomology]] which serves as a [[twisted cohomology|twist]] for the [[generalized cohomology theory]] in which the above [[integration]]/push-forward takes place.

* the [[push-forward in generalized cohomology|push-forward]] itself is the [[path integral quantization]], the construction of [[partition functions]].

### Path integral by integration against the Wiener measure

For instance the archetypical example of the quantization of the [[charged particle]] propagating on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ proceeds (in [[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]] form as it appears in the [[worldline formalism]] for corresponding QFT) like so: write $[\exp(-S_{kin}(\gamma)) D\gamma]$ for the [[Wiener measure]] on paths in $X$, then the [[integral kernel]] of the time evolution propagator of the quantum particle is given by the [[path integral]] (see there for more)

$$
  \int_{\gamma \in P_{x_{in}, x_{out}}X} tra_{\nabla}(\gamma) \; [\exp(- S_{kin}(\gamma)) D\gamma]
$$

which is the [[integration]] of the [[parallel transport]]/[[holonomy]] functional (of the given [[connection on a bundle|connection]] that models the [[background gauge field]]) against the [[Wiener measure]].


### Quantization by partition function/index in supersymmetric quantum mechanics

More generally, for given any [[phase space]] equipped with a [[prequantum line bundle]] $(L_\omega, \nabla)$, the corresponding _[[geometric quantization]]_ is, if $X$ admits a compatible [[spin^c structure]], the [[index]] of the [[spin^c Dirac operator]] coupled to this bundle, hence the [[space of quantum states]] is

$$
  \mathcal{H} = index( D_{\nabla} )
  \,.
$$

For more on this see at _[geometric quantization -- As Index of the Spin^c Dirac operator](geometric%20quantization#AsIndexOfSpinCDiracOperator)_.

Here the [[Dirac operator]] represents a class in [[K-homology]]

$$
  [D] \in KK(X, \mathbb{C})
$$

and this is now the "[[measure]]" against which the [[K-theory]] class

$$
  [L_\omega] \in KK(\mathbb{C}, X)
$$

of the [[prequantum line bundle]] is being integrated, by the [[index]] map hence the [[composition]] in [[KK-theory]]:

$$
  [\mathcal{H}] \simeq 
  (\mathbb{C} \stackrel{L_\omega}{\to} C(X) \stackrel{D}{\to} \mathbb{C} ) \in KK(\mathbb{C}, \mathbb{C})
  \,.
$$

By the discussion at _[[index]]_ this is equivalently the [[partition function]] of an auxiliary [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] system with [[background gauge field]] $\nabla$:

$$
  \mathcal{H} \simeq sTr( \exp(-t D^2) ) \;\;\;\; \forall t \gt 0
  \,.
$$

The appearance of an _auxiliary_ and already quantized field theory here may seem circular, but is in fact part of a deeper pattern of quantization by the [[holographic principle]], where rich quantum theories arise as [[boundary field theories]] of higher dimensional [[topological field theories]]. In the above case the higher dimensional theory is secretly the non-perturbative version of the [[Poisson sigma-model]] associated with the original [[phase space]] [[Poisson manifold]]. More details on this are indicated at _[[extended geometric quantization of 2d Chern-Simons theory]]_. In one dimension higher the [[Witten genus]] arises this way as the quantization of the [[heterotic string]] 2d QFT regarded as the [[boundary field theory]] of the [[M2-brane]] in [[Horava-Witten theory]]. (Wait for [Nuiten13](#Nuiten13) for more.)

### Cohomological formulation in BV-formalism

The choice of [[spin^c structure]] in the above is really the choice of a [[Poincaré  duality]] (see at [[Poincaré duality algebra]] for more) which exhibits the [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] by a combined [[Atiyah duality]]/[[Thom isomorphism]]. 

The analogue of such a choice of [[Poincaré duality]] between [[cohomology]] and [[homology]] in [[BV-formalism]] is the choice of a [[volume form]] that identified the [[de Rham complex]] with the [[BV-complex]] of [[multivector fields]]. See at _[BV-BRST formalism -- Homological integration](BV-BRST+formalism#HomologicalIntegration)_.

Again, here the [[kinetic action functional]] is part of the [[measure]], now under the duality part of the [[BV-operator]]. The [[quantum master equation]] is now the analog of the orientability condition. Homological BV-quantization is then obtain by assing to the [[homology groups]] of this [[BV-operator]], hence again by "pushing it to the point".

This is the setup in which one can derive [[Feynman diagram]] rules form cohomologicalquantization, see at _[Feynman diagram -- Refereces -- In homological BV-quantization](Feynman+diagram#ReferencesInHomologicalBVQuantization)_.
