## Definition

A __W\*-representation__, or simply a __representation__
of a [[von Neumann algebra]] $A$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$
is a morphism of [[von Neumann algebras]] $A\to B(H)$,
where $B(H)$ is the [[von Neumann algebra]]
of [[bounded operators]] on the [[Hilbert space]] $H$.

## Warning

If the map $A\to B(H)$ is injective,
the resulting notion coincides with that of a “concrete von Neumann algebra”,
as opposed to an (abstract) [[von Neumann algebra]].
An isomorphism of representations is sometimes referred to as
a “spatial isomorphism of concrete von Neumann algebras”.

Such terminology is confusing, but is present in some sources, especially older ones.

## Properties

The category of [[W*-representations]] of $A$
is equivalent to the category of [[Hilbert W*-modules]] over $A$.

See the article [[Hilbert W*-module]] for more information.
