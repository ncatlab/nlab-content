A **Chern-Simons gerbe** is a [[lifting gerbe]] for the shifted central [[group extension|extension]]

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1) \to String(G) \to G
$$

given by the [[string group]].

This is called "Chern-Simons gerbe" because for a given $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P$; the corresponding Chern-Simons gerbe has the property that

* the integral class of the gerbe is the first (fractional) [[Pontryagin class]] of $P$

* a connection on the Chern-Simons gerbe has as [[curvature]] 3-form the [[Chern-Simons form]] of a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on $P$.
