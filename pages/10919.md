## Idea

A school of [[philosophy]] emphasizing clarity of argument, [[formal logic]], and aiming for strong connections with natural [[sciences]] such as [[physics]]. 

Analytic philosophy to some extent defined itself, via people like [[Bertrand Russell]], in opposition to the [[objective idealism]] of [[Georg Hegel]] as expressed for instance in his _[[Science of Logic]]_. See at _[Perception of Hegel's Naturphilosophie](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Georg+Hegel#PerceptionOfHegelsPhilosophy)_ for more on this.
