### Definition

A [[locale]] is __paracompact__ if it is [[regular]] and every open cover has a [[locally finite]] refinement.

### Properties

Paracompact locales are very closely related to [[fully normal locales]].
In fact, for [[regular locales]] these two properties are equivalent.

Any [[metrizable locale]] is paracompact.

Any [[Lindel√∂f locale]] is paracompact.

A [[locale]] is paracompact if and only if it admits a [[complete uniformity]].

The [[full subcategory]] of paracompact locales is a [[reflective subcategory]]
of the category of [[completely regular locales]] as well as the category of all [[locales]].

In particular, the inclusion functor from paracompact locales to locales
preserves [[small limits]], so in particular, products of paracompact locales are paracompact.

This last property clearly distinguishes paracompact locales from paracompact spaces,
since products of paracompact spaces need not be paracompact.
