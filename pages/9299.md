###### Definition

If a [[category]] $C$ carries a [[model category]] structure, then the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ carries the **opposite model structure**: 

its [[weak equivalences]] are those morphisms whose dual was a weak equivalence in $C$, its [[fibrations]] are those morphisms that were cofibrations in $C$ and its [[cofibrations]] are those that were fibrations in $C$.
