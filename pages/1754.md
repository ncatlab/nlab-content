An [[infinity-stack]] on a [[(infinity,1)-category]]-domain $C$ that happens to be an ordinary [[category]] (i.e. not a [[derived stack]]) is **rectified** if it is an ordinary [[functor]]
$
 C^{op} \to  $ [[SSet]] instead of a general [[(infinity,1)-functor]] (i.e. [[pseudofunctor]]).

A central theorem about the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] says that rectified [[infinity-stack]]s are _sufficient_: they already [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|present]] the full [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] (= [[infinity-stack]]s).

Notice that, by a result recalled at [[descent for simplicial presheaves]], a rectified $\infty$-stack $A$ is an [[infinity-groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] (pre)sheaves satisfying a [[descent]] condition.
