The __valuative criterion of separatedness__ is [[EGA II]], 7.2.3. ([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1961__8__5_0)) which translated into English says

**Proposition.** Let $X$ be a [[scheme]] (resp. a [[locally noetherian scheme]]),
 $f: X\to Y$ a morphism of schemes (resp. a morphism locally of finite type). The following conditions are equivalent

a) $f$ is [[separated morphism of schemes|separated]].

b) The diagonal morphism $X\to X\times_Y X$ is [[quasicompact morphism|quasicompact]], and for every affine scheme $Y' = Spec A$ in which $A$ is a [[valuation ring]] (resp. a discrete valuation ring), any two morphisms from $Y'\to X$ which coincide at the generic point of $Y'$ are equal.

c) The diagonal morphism $X\to X\times_Y X$ is quasicompact, and for every affine scheme of the form  $Y' = Spec A$ in which $A$ is a valuation ring (resp. a discrete valuation ring), any two sections of $X' = X(Y')$ which coincide at the generic point of $Y'$ are equal.
