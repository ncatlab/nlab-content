## Definition 

An **extremal monomorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[monomorphism]] $m$ such that if $m = g e$ where $e$ is an [[epimorphism]], then $e$ is an isomorphism.

## Remarks 

The dual concept is [[extremal epimorphism]], and all properties of [[extremal epimorphism]]s apply in the dual sense to extremal monomorphisms.

In [[Top]] the extremal monomorphisms coincide with the [[regular monomorphism]]s, and these are exactly the subspace embeddings.
