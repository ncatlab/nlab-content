## Idea

One notion often called an __enriched bicategory__ is the same as that of an [[enriched category]], but where the enriching context $\mathcal{V}$ is allowed to be generalized from a [[monoidal category]] to a [[monoidal bicategory]], while suitably weakening the [[associativity]] and [[unitality]] conditions on the enrichment.  Thus, it has a collection of objects with [[hom-objects]] $C(x,y)\in\mathcal{V}$.  It may also naturally be called a **pseudo enriched category**.

A different notion that is also sometimes called an **enriched bicategory** is that of a bicategory enriched over a [[monoidal category|monoidal 1-category]] $V$ (which must be at least [[braided monoidal category|braided]]) at the level of 2-cells only.  Thus it has a collection of objects, with 1-morphisms between the objects, and for any parallel 1-morphisms $f,g\colon x\to y$, a hom-object $C(x,y)(f,g) \in V$.  This can be identified with a $(V Cat)$-enriched bicategory in the previous sense, so on this page we focus on the former, more general, definition.


## Definition

For $\mathcal{V}$ a [[monoidal bicategory]], a  $\mathcal{V}$-enriched (bi)category $C$ consists of

* a collection of [[object]]s;

* for every ordered pair $(x,y)$ of objects a [[hom-object]] $C(x,y) \in \mathcal{V}$

* for every ordered triple $(x,y,z)$ a [[composition]] morphism of the form

  $$
    comp_{x,y,z} : C(x,y)\otimes C(y,z) \to C(x,z)
  $$ 

  in $\mathcal{V}$

* for every object $x$ an [[identity]] morphism

  $$
    i_x : I \to C(x,x) 
  $$

  from the tensor unit of $\mathcal{V}$;

* a [[natural isomorphism|natural 2-ismorphism]]

  $$
    \alpha : comp(Id \otimes comp) \Rightarrow comp(comp \otimes Id)
  $$
 
  called the [[associator]]

* similarly left and right [[unitor]]s

* such that some more or less evident [[coherence]] conditions hold (see the references).


## Examples

* When $\mathcal{V} = Cat$, a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched bicategory is just a plain [[bicategory]].

* When $\mathcal{V}$ is an ordinary [[monoidal category]], a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched bicategory is just an ordinary [[enriched category]].

* When $\mathcal{V}$ is the cartesian monoidal 2-category of bicategories, pseudo [[2-functors]], and [[icons]], then a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched bicategory is an [[iconic tricategory]].

* When $\mathcal{V}$ is the cartesian monoidal 2-category of [[fully faithful functors]], then a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched bicategory is a weak [[F-category]].
