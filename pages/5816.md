## Idea

The notion often called an _enriched bicategory_ is that of an [[enriched category]], but where the enriching context $\mathcal{V}$ is allowed to be generalized from a [[monoidal category]] to a [[monoidal bicategory]], while suitably weakening the [[associativity]] any [[unitality]] conditions on the enrichment.

So for $\mathcal{V}$ a [[monoidal bicategory]], a  $\mathcal{V}$-enriched (bi)category $C$ is

* a collection of [[object]]s;

* for every ordered pair $(x,y)$ of objects a [[hom-object]] $C(x,y) \in \mathcal{V}$

* for every ordered triple $(x,y,z)$ a [[composition]] morphism of the form

  $$
    comp_{x,y,z} : C(x,y)\otimes C(y,z) \to C(x,z)
  $$ 

  in $\mathcal{V}$

* for every object $x$ an [[identity]] morphism

  $$
    i_x : I \to C(x,x) 
  $$

  from the tensor unit of $\mathcal{V}$;

* a [[natural isomorphism|natural 2-ismorphism]]

  $$
    \alpha : comp(Id \otimes comp) \Rightarrow comp(comp \otimes Id)
  $$
 
  called the [[associator]]

* similarly left and right [[unitor]]s

* such that some more or less evident [[coherence]] conditions hold.
