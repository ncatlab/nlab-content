$Semi Lat$ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[semilattices]] and whose [[morphisms]] are semilattice [[homomorphisms]], that is [[functions]] which preserve finitary [[joins]] (equivalently, binary joins and the [[bottom element]]).

We mention joins above as if the objects are join-semilattices; one can just as well consider them meet-semilattices and say that the homomorphisms preserve finitary [[meets]] (including the [[top element]]).  For $Semi Lat$ in itself, this is purely a difference in notational convention.  However, this choice corresponds to using either of two [[inclusion functor]]s representing $Semi Lat$ as a [[subcategory]] of [[Pos]].
