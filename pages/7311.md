## Idea

In an [[infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos|∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] $H$ possessing a ∞-cohesive (∞,1)-site of definition the $\mathbf{\Pi}$-closed morphisms into an object $X\in H$ may be identified with (∞,1)-sheaves which are locally constant on $X$. The classification of locally constant (∞,1)-sheaves is called (higher) Galois theory, too.

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Let $(\Pi\dashv \Disc\dashv \Gamma):H\to\infty\Grpd$ be an [[infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos]], let ${\mathbf{\Pi}}:=\Disc \Pi$ be the geometric path functor / geometric homotopy functor, let $f:X\to Y$ be a $H$-morphism, let $c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f$ denote the ∞-pullback


$$\array{c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f&\to& {\mathbf{\Pi}} X\\\downarrow&&\downarrow^{{\mathbf{\Pi}}_f}\\Y&\xrightarrow{1_{(\Pi\dashv \Disc)}}&{\mathbf{\Pi}}Y}$$

$c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f$ is called ${\mathbf{\Pi}}$**-closure of** $f$.

$f$ is called ${\mathbf{\Pi}}$**-closed** if $X\simeq c_{\mathbf{\Pi}}f$.

If a morphism $f:X\to Y$ factors into $f=g\circ h$ and $h$ is a $\mathbf{\Pi}$-equivalence then $g$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}$-closed; this is seen by using that ${\mathbf{\Pi}}$ is idempotent.




## Properties

* $\Pi$-closed morphisms are a right class of an orthogonal factorization system and hence (see [catlab](http://ncatlab.org/joyalscatlab/show/Factorisation+systems#orthogonality_16)) are closed under limits, composition, retracts and satisfy the left cancellation property.

* A consequence of the previous property is that the class of $\mathbf{\Pi}$-closed morphisms gives rise to an admissible structure (in the sense of [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured spaces]]) on an (∞,1)-connected (∞,1)-topos.

###### Proposition
Let $H$ be a cohesive (∞,1)-topos possessing a ∞-cohesive site of definition.
Then for $X\in H$ the locally constant ∞-stacks $E\in \L\Const(X)$, regarded as ∞-bundle morphisms $p:E\to X$ are precisely the $\mathbf{\Pi}$-closed morphisms into $X$
