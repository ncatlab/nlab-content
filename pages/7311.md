## Idea

In a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] with [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]] [[inverse image]] (such as a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]), the extra [[left adjoint]] $\Pi$ to the [[inverse image]] $Disc$ of the [[global sections]] [[geometric morphism]] $\Gamma$ induces a  [[higher modality]] $&#643; \coloneqq Disc \circ \Pi$, which sends an [[object]] to something that may be regarded equivalently as its [[geometric realization]] or its [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] (see at _[[fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]]_). In either case $&#643; X$ may be thought of as the _[[shape]]_ of $X$ and therefore one may call $&#643;$ the _shape modality_.  It forms an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[flat modality]] $\flat \coloneqq Disc \circ \Gamma$.




## Properties

### Relative shape and factorization system

Generally, given an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ (or just a 1-[[topos]]) equipped with an [[idempotent monad]] $&#643; \colon \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}$ (a [[modal type theory|(higher) modality]]/[[closure operator]]) which preserves [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] over objects in its [[essential image]], one may call a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathbf{H}$ _$&#643;$-closed_ if the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]-diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{\eta_X}{\to}& &#643;(X)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{&#643;(f)}}
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{\eta_Y}{\to}& &#643;(Y)
  }
$$

is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] diagram. These $&#643;$-closed morphisms form the right half of an [[orthogonal factorization system]], the left half being the morphisms that are sent to [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalences]] in $\mathbf{H}$.

###### Definition

Let $(\Pi\dashv \Disc\dashv \Gamma):H\to\infty\Grpd$ be an [[infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos]], let $&#643;:=\Disc \Pi$ be the geometric path functor / geometric homotopy functor, let $f:X\to Y$ be a $H$-morphism, let $c_{&#643;} f$ denote the ∞-pullback


$$\array{c_{&#643;} f&\to& {&#643;} X\\\downarrow&&\downarrow^{{&#643;}_f}\\Y&\xrightarrow{1_{(\Pi\dashv \Disc)}}&{&#643;}Y}$$

$c_{&#643;} f$ is called $&#643;$**-closure of** $f$.

$f$ is called $&#643;$**-closed** if $X\simeq c_{&#643;}f$.
=--

If a morphism $f:X\to Y$ factors into $f=g\circ h$ and $h$ is a $&#643;$-equivalence then $g$ is $&#643;$-closed; this is seen by using that $&#643;$ is idempotent.



$\Pi$-closed morphisms are a right class of an [[orthogonal factorization system]] ([[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category|in an (∞,1)-category]]) and hence, as discussed there, are closed under [[limits]], [[composition]], [[retracts]] and satisfy the left cancellation property.

### As open maps

A consequence of the previous property is that the class of $&#643;$-closed morphisms gives rise to an admissible structure in the sense of [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured spaces]] on an (∞,1)-connected (∞,1)-topos, hence they serve as a class of a kind of [[open maps]].


## Examples

### Internal locally constant $\infty$-stacks
 {#LocallyConstantStacks}

In a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with an [[∞-cohesive site]] of definition, the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]-functor $&#643;$ satisfies the above assumptions (this is the example gives this entry its name). The $&#643;$-closed morphisms into some $X \in \mathbf{H}$ are canonically identified with the [[locally constant ∞-stacks]] over $X$. The correspondence is effectively what is called [[categorical Galois theory]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $H$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] possessing a [[∞-cohesive site]] of definition.
Then for $X\in H$ the locally constant ∞-stacks $E\in \L\Const(X)$, regarded as ∞-bundle morphisms $p:E\to X$ are precisely the $&#643;$-closed morphisms into $X$

### Formally étale morphisms 
 {#EtaleMorphisms}

If a [[differential cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{th}$, the [[de Rham space]] functor $\Im$ satisfies the above assumptions. The $\Im$-closed morphisms are precisely the [[formally étale morphisms]].
