## Idea

In a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] with [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]] [[inverse image]] (such as a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]), the extra [[left adjoint]] $\Pi$ to the [[inverse image]] $Disc$ of the [[global sections]] [[geometric morphism]] $\Gamma$ induces a  [[higher modality]] $\esh \coloneqq Disc \circ \Pi$, which sends an [[object]] to something that may be regarded equivalently as its [[geometric realization]] or its [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] (see at _[[fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]]_ and at _[[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid]]_). In either case $\esh X$ may be thought of as the _[[shape]]_ of $X$ and therefore one may call $\esh$ the _shape modality_.  It forms an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[flat modality]] $\flat \coloneqq Disc \circ \Gamma$.




## Properties

### Preservation of some $\infty$-fiber products
 {#PreservationOfSomeHomotopyFiberProducts}

The shape operation is defined to [[preserved limit|preserve]] [[finite products|finite]] [[homotopy products]] and small [[(infinity,1)-colimits|homotopy colimits]] (being a [[left adjoint]]) but it does not preserve general [[(infinity,1)-limits|homotopy limits]], not even all [[homotopy pullbacks]]:

\begin{example}
**(shape does not preserve homotopy fibers of points over positive-dimensional smooth spheres)**
\linebreak
  For $n \in \mathbb{N}_+$ consider the [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]] in its standard incarnation as a [[smooth manifold]] (or just as a [[D-topological space]]) and as such as a [[0-truncated]] [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth $\infty$-groupoid]]
$$
  S^n_{smth} \,\in\, SmthMfd \hookrightarrow SmthGrpd_\infty
  \,.
$$ 
This is such that the shape is the $n$-sphere as a geometrically [[discrete object|discrete]] higher [[homotopy type]]
$$
  \esh S^n_{smth} \,\simeq\, S^n \,\in\,
  Grpd_\infty 
  \xhookrightarrow{Disc} 
  SmthGrpd_{\infty}.
$$

Now for $x \colon \ast \to S^n_{smth}$ any point (and using that $\esh \ast \,=\, \ast$ by the condition that $\esh$ preserves [[finite products]]):

1. its [[fiber product]] over $S^n_{smth}$ may be computed in [[SmthMfd]] and hence is that same point:

1. its [[homotopy fiber product]] over $S^n = \esh S^n_{smth}$ is the [[loop space]] $\Omega S^n$, which (under our assumption that $n$ is a [[positive number]]) is far from equivalent to the point (for example: $\Omega S^1 \,\simeq\, \mathbb{Z}$).

Hence

$$
  n \in \mathbb{N}_+
  \;\;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;\;
  \ast
  \;\simeq\;
  \esh
  \big(
    \ast 
     \underset
       {S^n_{smth}}
       {\times}
    \ast
  \big)
  \;\neq\;
  \big(
    (\esh\ast) 
     \underset
       {\esh S^n_{smth}}
       {\times}
    (\esh\ast) 
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \Omega S^{n}
  \,.
$$
\end{example}

### Relative shape and factorization system

Generally, given an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ (or just a 1-[[topos]]) equipped with an [[idempotent monad]] $\esh \colon \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}$ (a [[modal type theory|(higher) modality]]/[[closure operator]]) which preserves [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] over objects in its [[essential image]], one may call a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathbf{H}$ _$\esh$-closed_ if the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]-diagram

$$
  \array{
    X 
    &\overset{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& \esh(X)
    \\
    \big\downarrow {\mathrlap{{}^f}} 
    && 
    \big\downarrow{\mathrlap{{}^{\esh(f)}}}
    \\
    Y 
    &
    \overset{\eta_Y}{\longrightarrow}
    & 
    \esh(Y)
  }
$$

is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] diagram. These $\esh$-closed morphisms form the right half of an [[orthogonal factorization system]], the left half being the morphisms that are sent to [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalences]] in $\mathbf{H}$.

###### Definition

Let $(\Pi\dashv \Disc\dashv \Gamma):H\to\infty\Grpd$ be an [[infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos]], let $\esh:=\Disc \Pi$ be the geometric path functor / geometric homotopy functor, let $f:X\to Y$ be a $H$-morphism, let $c_{\esh} f$ denote the ∞-pullback


$$
  \array{
    c_{\esh} f
    &\longrightarrow& 
    {\esh} X
    \\
    \big\downarrow
    &&
    \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{{\esh}_f}}   
    \\
    Y
    &\xrightarrow{1_{(\Pi\dashv \Disc)}}
    &
    {\esh}Y
  }
$$

$c_{\esh} f$ is called $\esh$**-closure of** $f$.

$f$ is called $\esh$**-closed** if $X\simeq c_{\esh}f$.
=--

If a morphism $f:X\to Y$ factors into $f=g\circ h$ and $h$ is a $\esh$-equivalence then $g$ is $\esh$-closed; this is seen by using that $\esh$ is idempotent.



$\Pi$-closed morphisms are a right class of an [[orthogonal factorization system]] ([[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category|in an (∞,1)-category]]) and hence, as discussed there, are closed under [[limits]], [[composition]], [[retracts]] and satisfy the left cancellation property.

\begin{remark}
**(shape-modal maps as open maps)**
\linebreak
A consequence of the previous property is that the class of $\esh$-closed morphisms gives rise to an admissible structure in the sense of [[structured (infinity,1)-topos|structured spaces]] on an (∞,1)-connected (∞,1)-topos, hence they serve as a class of a kind of *[[open maps]]*.
\end{remark}

### Shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid

See at _[[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid]]_.

## Examples

### Internal locally constant $\infty$-stacks
 {#LocallyConstantStacks}

In a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with an [[∞-cohesive site]] of definition, the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]-functor $\esh$ satisfies the above assumptions (this is the example gives this entry its name). The $\esh$-closed morphisms into some $X \in \mathbf{H}$ are canonically identified with the [[locally constant ∞-stacks]] over $X$. The correspondence is effectively what is called [[categorical Galois theory]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $H$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] possessing a [[∞-cohesive site]] of definition.
Then for $X\in H$ the locally constant ∞-stacks $E\in \L\Const(X)$, regarded as ∞-bundle morphisms $p:E\to X$ are precisely the $\esh$-closed morphisms into $X$

### Formally &#233;tale morphisms
 {#EtaleMorphisms}

If a [[differential cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{th}$, the [[de Rham space]] functor $\Im$ satisfies the above assumptions. The $\Im$-closed morphisms are precisely the [[formally étale morphisms]].
