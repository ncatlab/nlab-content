## Definition

A __properad__ in a [[symmetric monoidal
category]]&#160;$C$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[monoidal
category]] of [[symmetric sequence|bisymmetric sequences]] in&#160;$C$ (i.e.,
functors $\Sigma\times\Sigma\to C$) equipped
with a version of [[substitution product]]
modeled on connected directed graphs with 2 levels
instead of corollas, which are used for [[operads]].
See &#167;1.2 in Vallette&#160;[1] for details.
The idea is that operations in a properad can
have multiple inputs and outputs, as opposed
to a single output in an operad.

### Relation to polycategories, dioperads and PROPs

A coloured properad is more general than a [[polycategory]] in that it allows composition along more than one object. See [Polycategory: Relation to properads](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/polycategory#relation_to_properads) for a more detailed explanation.

Unlike with polycategories and dioperads (and [[multicategories]] and [[operads]]), there doesn't appear to be different terminology in the literature for one-coloured versus multicoloured properads.

Properads are less general than [[PROPs]], which also allow a "composition" of nonconnected graphs, by tensoring morphisms with $\otimes$.
