## Idea

Given an [[inner product space]] $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ then two [[vectors]] $v,w \in W$ are _normal_ to each other if they are _[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]_ to each other, in that their [[inner product]] vanishes:  $\langle v,w\rangle = 0$.

Given an [[embedding of differentiable manifolds]] $i_X \colon X \hookrightarrow Y$ where $Y$carries [[Riemannian geometry]] structure, then the [[normal bundle]] of $i_X$ is the [[vector bundle]] of [[tangent vectors]] in $Y$ that are normal to [[tangent vectors]] of $X$.
