## Idea

The concept of _finite [[(∞,1)-category]]_ is the generalization of [[finite homotopy type]] from [[∞-groupoids]]([[(∞,0)-categories]]) to [[(∞,1)-categories]].

If we model [[(∞,1)-categories]] by [[quasicategories]], then this can be made precise by saying it is equivalent to the fibrant replacement in the [[Joyal model structure]] of a [[simplicial set]] with finitely many nondegenerate [[simplices]] (in the [[∞-groupoid]] case also: [[finite CW-complex]]).
