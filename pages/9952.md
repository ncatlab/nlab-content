## Idea

A finitely presented [[(∞,1)-category]].

If we model [[(∞,1)-categories]] by [[quasicategories]], then this can be made precise by saying it is equivalent to the fibrant replacement in the [[Joyal model structure]] of a [[simplicial set]] with finitely many nondegenerate [[simplices]].
