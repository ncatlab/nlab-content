## Idea

A _minimal Kan fibration_ is a [[Kan fibration]] whose [[fibers]] are, in some sense, as small as possible in its weak homotopy class. Minimal [[Kan complexes]] (i.e. minimal fibrations over the point) are the analogue in [[simplicial sets]] of [[minimal Sullivan models]] in [[rational homotopy theory]].

## Definition

A [[Kan fibration]] $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$ is called 
a **minimal Kan fibration** if any two cells in the same fiber with the same boundary and which are homotopic relative boundary are already equal.
