## Idea

_Rational 2d conformal field theories_ are that class of relatively simple [[2d CFTs]], such as the [[WZW model]], which are characterized by the fact that their spaces of [[conformal blocks]] are [[finite dimensional vector spaces]]. Locally such 2d CFTs are given by a [[rational vertex operator algebra]].

Interpreted as [[perturbative string theory vacua]], rational [[2d CFTs]] correspond to ([[non-geometric string vacuum|non-geometric]]) [[target spaces]] which are [[compact topological spaces|compact]] (such as [[fibers]] of [[Kaluza-Klein compactifications]], but not [[Minkowski spacetime]], for instance). See e.g. [Schomerus 05](#Schomerus05) for contrast.

## Properties

### Classification

The [[FRS-theorem on rational 2d CFT]] provides a complete classification of rational 2d CFT via the [[CS-WZW correspondence]] and the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] of [[3d Chern-Simons theory]].

## Examples

* [[WZW model]]

* [[Gepner model]]

## Related concepts

* [[boundary CFT]]

* [[minimal model CFT]]

* [[logarithmic CFT]]
