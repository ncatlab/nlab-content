## Idea

_Rational 2d conformal field theories_ are that class of relatively simple [[2d CFTs]], such as the [[WZW model]], which are characterized by the fact that their spaces of [[conformal blocks]] are [[finite dimensional vector spaces]].

Locally such 2d CFTs are given by a [[rational vertex operator algebra]].

## Properties

### Classification

The [[FRS-theorem on rational 2d CFT]] provides a complete classification of rational 2d CFT via the [[CS-WZW correspondence]] and the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] of [[3d Chern-Simons theory]].
