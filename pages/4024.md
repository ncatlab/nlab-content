## Idea

A _bornological set_ is a notion of space, where instead of considering open sets and continuous functions whose inverse images preserve open sets as one does for [[topological space]]s, one considers bounded sets (which constitute a _bornology_) and bounded maps whose direct images preserve bounded sets. Bornological [[topological vector spaces]], called [[bornological spaces]], are important in [[functional analysis]].


## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[set]]. A **bornology** on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B} \subseteq P X$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ such that 

* $\mathcal{B}$ covers $X$: $\bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{B}} B = X$, 

* $\mathcal{B}$ is downward-closed: if $B \in \mathcal{B}$ and $A \subseteq B$, then $A \in \mathcal{B}$, 

* $\mathcal{B}$ is closed under finite unions: if $B_1 \ldots, B_n \in \mathcal{B}$, then $\bigcup_{1 \leq \i \leq n} B_i \in \mathcal{B}$. 

A **bornological set** is a set $X$ equipped with a bornology. The elements of $\mathcal{B}$ are called the **bounded sets** of a bornological set. 

If $X$, $Y$ are bornological sets, a [[function]] $f\colon X \to Y$ is said to be **bounded** if $f(B)$ is bounded in $Y$ for every bounded $B$ in $X$. One obtains a category of bornological sets and bounded maps. 


## Examples

* If $X$ is any [[topological space]], there is a bornology consisting of all [[precompact subset]]s of $X$ (subsets whose closure is compact).  Any [[continuous map]] is bounded with respect to this choice of bornology. 

* If $X$ is any [[metric space]], there is a bornology where a set is bounded if it is contained in some open [[ball]]. Any [[Lipschitz map]] is bounded with respect to this choice of bornology. 

* For [[linear operators]] between [[bornological spaces]], a map is continuous if and only if it is bounded.
