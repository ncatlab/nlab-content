## Idea

A [[geometric morphism]] $f : E \to F$ between [[topos]]es is a [[functor]] of the underlying categories that is consistent with the interpretation of $E$ and $F$ as generalized [[topological space]]s. 

A geometric morphism is **essential** if in addition $f$ behaves as if...

+--{: .query}
[[Mike Shulman]]: Interesting ellipsis.  I'm not sure that "essentiality" has any real intuitive meaning; it's kind of "like being locally connected" except not quite right if $F$ isn't $Set$.

## Definition

Given a geometric morphism $(f^* \dashv f_*) : E \to F$, it is an **essential geometric morphism** if the [[inverse image]] functor $f^*$ has not only the [[right adjoint]] $f_*$, but also a [[left adjoint]] $f_!$:

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_*) \;\;\; : \;\;\;
  E
    \stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\overset{f_*}{\to}}}
  F
  \,.
$$

## Examples

For any morphism $f\colon A\to B$ in a topos $E$, the induced geometric morphism $f\colon E/A \to E/B$ is essential.

A [[locally connected topos]] $E$ is one where the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] $\Gamma : E \to Set$ is essential. 

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_*) \;\;\; : \;\;\;
  E
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_0}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\overset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  Set
  \,.
$$

In this caes, the functor $\Gamma_! = \Pi_0 : E \to Set$ sends each object to its set of connected components.  More on this situation is at [[homotopy groups in an (âˆž,1)-topos]].  Note, though that if $p\colon E\to S$ is an arbitrary geometric morphism through which we regard $E$ as an $S$-topos, i.e. a topos "in the world of $S$," the condition for $E$ to be locally connected as an $S$-topos is not just that $p$ is essential, but that the left adjoint $p_!$ can be made into an $S$-[[indexed functor]] (which is automatically true for $p^*$ and $p_*$).  This is automatically the case for $Set$-toposes (at least, when our [[foundation]] is [[material set theory]]---and if our foundation is [[structural set theory]], then our large categories and functors all need to be assumed to be $Set$-indexing anyway).
