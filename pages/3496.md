## Idea

A [[geometric morphism]] $f : E \to F$ between [[topos]]es is a [[functor]] of the underlying categories that is consistent with the interpretation of $E$ and $F$ as generalized [[topological space]]s. 

If $F = Set = Sh(*)$ is the terminal [[sheaf topos]], then $E \to Set$ is essential if $E$ is a [[locally connected topos]]. In general, $f$ being essential is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition to ensure that $f$ behaves like a map of topological spaces whose [[fiber]]s are locally connected: that it is a [[locally connected geometric morphism]].


## Definition


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a [[geometric morphism]] $(f^* \dashv f_*) : E \to F$, it is an **essential geometric morphism** if the [[inverse image]] functor $f^*$ has not only the [[right adjoint]] $f_*$, but also a [[left adjoint]] $f_!$:

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_*) 
  \;\;\; : \;\;\;
  E
    \stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}{\to}}}
  F
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


There are various further conditions that can be imposed on a geometric morphism:

* If $f_!$ can be made into an $E$-[[indexed functor]] and $f^*$ satisfies some extra conditions, the geometric morphism $f$ is a [[locally connected geometric morphism]] (see there for details).

* If $f_!$ preserves finite [[product]]s then $f$ is called **connected surjective**.

* If $f_!$ preserves finite [[product]]s and moreover there is a further functor $f^! : F \to E$ which is  [[right adjoint]] $(f_* \dashv f^!)$ and [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]], i.e. if we have a sequence of adjunctions

  $$
    (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!)
  $$

  with full and faithful $f^!$ then the geometric morphism $f$ is called **[[local geometric morphism]]**.

  In this case in particular $F \stackrel{\overset{p_*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{p^!}{\hookrightarrow}} E$

  is a [[geometric embedding]] and hence makes $F$ a subtopos of $E$.

### Relation to morphisms of (co)sites
 {#RelationToSiteMorphisms}


For $C$ and $D$ [[small categories]] write $[C,Set]$ and $[D,Set]$ for the corresponding [[copresheaf]] [[presheaf topos|toposes]]. (If we think of the [[opposite categories]] $C^{op}$ and $D^{op}$ as [[sites]] equipped with the trivial [[coverage]], then these are the corresponding [[sheaf toposes]].)

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

This construction extends to a [[2-functor]]

$$
  [-,Set] : Cat_{small}^{co} \to Topos_{ess}
$$

from the [[2-category]] [[Cat]]${}_{small}$ with [[2-morphism]]s reversed) to the sub-2-category of [[Topos]] on essential geometric morphisms, where a [[functor]] $f : C \to D$ is sent to the essential geometric morphism

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_!) : 
  [C,Set]
    \stackrel{\overset{f_! := Lan_f}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^* := (-) \circ f}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f^* := Ran_f}{\to}}}
  [D,Set]
  \,,
$$

where $Lan_f$ and $Ran_f$ denote the left and right [[Kan extension]] along $f$, respectively.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

This 2-functor is a [[full and faithful 2-functor]] when restricted to [[Cauchy complete categories]]:

$$
  [-, Set] : Cat^co_{CauchyComp} \hookrightarrow Topos_{ess}
  \,.
$$

For all small categories $C,D$ we have an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Func(\overline{C},\overline{D})^{op}
  \simeq
  Topos_{ess}([C,Set], [D,Set])
$$

between the [[opposite category]] of the [[functor category]] between the [[Cauchy completion]]s of $C$ and $D$ and the the category of essential geometric morphisms between the copresheaf toposes and [[geometric transformation]]s between them.

=--

In particular, since every [[poset]] -- when regarded as a [[category]] -- is Cauchy complete, we have

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

The [[2-functor]]

$$
  [-,Set] : Poset \to Topos_{ess}
$$

is a [[full and faithful 2-functor]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Sometimes it is useful to decompose this statement as follows.

There is a functor 

$$
  Alex : Poset \to Locale
$$

which assigns to each [[poset]] a [[locale]] called its [[Alexandrov locale]]. By a theorem discussed there, a morphisms of locales $f : X \to Y$ is in the image of this functor precisely if its inverse image morphism $f^* Op(Y) \to Op(X)$ of [[frame]]s has a [[left adjoint]] in the [[2-category]] [[Locale]]. 

Moreover, for any poset $P$ the [[sheaf topos]] over $Alex P$ is naturally equivalent to $[P,Set]$

$$
  [-,Set] \simeq Sh \circ Alex
  \,.
$$

With this, the fact that $[-,Set] : Poset \to Topos$ hits precisely the essential geometric morphisms follows with the basic fact about [[localic reflection]], which says that $Sh : Locale \to Topos$ is a [[full and faithful 2-functor]].

### Some morphism calculus



+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $f : E \to F$ be an essential geometric morphism.

For every $\phi : X \to f^* f_* A$ in $E$ the diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}& f^* f_* A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    f^* f_! X &\stackrel{}{\to}& A
  }
$$

commutes, where the vertical morphisms are unit and counit, respectively, and where the bottom horizontal morphism is the [[adjunct]] of $\phi$ under the composite adjunction $(f^* f_! \dashv f^* f_*)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The morphism $\phi : X \to f^* f_* A$ is the component of a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \array{
    *&&\overset{X}{\to}&& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{A}}\downarrow
    &\Downarrow^\phi&& {}^{\mathllap{f^*}}\nearrow 
    \\
    E &\underset{f_*}{\to}&F
  }
  \,.
$$

The composite $X \stackrel{\phi}{\to}  f^* f_* A \to A$ is the component of this composed with the counit $f^* f_* \Rightarrow Id$.

We may insert the 2-identity given by the zig-zag law

$$
  \cdots \;\;\; = \;\;\;
  \array{
    *&&\overset{X}{\to}&& E && = && E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{A}}\downarrow
    &\Downarrow^\phi&& {}^{\mathllap{f^*}}\nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow^{f_!} 
    &\Downarrow& \nearrow_{\mathrlap{f^*}}
    \\
    E &\underset{f_*}{\to}&F &&=&& F   
  }
  \,.
$$

Composing this with the counit $f^* f_* \Rightarrow Id$ produces the transformation whose component is manifestly the morphism $X \to f^* f_! X \to A$.

## Examples

### Etale geometric morphisms

For any morphism $f\colon A\to B$ in a topos $E$, the induced geometric morphism $f\colon E/A \to E/B$ of [[overcategory]] [[topos]]es is essential. 

For the case $B = *$ the [[terminal object]], the geometric morphism

$$
  \pi : E/A \to E
$$

is also called an [[etale geometric morphism]].

### Locally connected toposes

A [[locally connected topos]] $E$ is one where the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] $\Gamma : E \to Set$ is essential. 

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_*) \;\;\; : \;\;\;
  E
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_0}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  Set
  \,.
$$

In this case, the functor $\Gamma_! = \Pi_0 : E \to Set$ sends each object to its set of connected components.  More on this situation is at [[homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]].  

Note, though that if $p\colon E\to S$ is an arbitrary geometric morphism through which we regard $E$ as an $S$-topos, i.e. a topos "in the world of $S$," the condition for $E$ to be locally connected as an $S$-topos is not just that $p$ is essential, but that the left adjoint $p_!$ can be made into an $S$-[[indexed functor]] (which is automatically true for $p^*$ and $p_*$).  This is automatically the case for $Set$-toposes (at least, when our [[foundation]] is [[material set theory]]---and if our foundation is [[structural set theory]], then our large categories and functors all need to be assumed to be $Set$-indexing anyway). For more see [[locally connected geometric morphism]].
