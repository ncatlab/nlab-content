## Definition

A **locally cartesian closed category** is a [[category]] $C$ whose [[slice categories]] $C/x$ are all [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. 

If $C$ has a [[terminal object]], then $C$ is itself cartesian closed and in fact [[finitely complete category|has all finite limit]]s; often this requirement is included in the definition.

Equivalently, a locally cartesian category $C$ is a category with [[pullback]]s (and a terminal object, if required) such that each [[base change]] functor $f^*: C/y \to C/x$ has a right adjoint $\Pi_f$, called a [[dependent product]]. 

In particular, such pullbacks preserve all [[colimit]]s. Therefore, if a locally cartesian closed category [[finitely cocomplete category|has finite colimit]]s, it is automatically a [[coherent category]] and in fact a [[Heyting category]].


## Properties

### Internal logic

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed categories is an [[extensional type theory|extensional]] form of [[dependent type theory]].  In particular, the [[dependent product]] $\Pi_f$ represents an extensional [[dependent product type]] in the internal logic.

### Almost local cartesian closure

There are categories which are cartesian closed and not locally cartesian closed, but in which for some $f$ the  base change functor $f^*: C/y \to C/x$ has a right adjoint. This includes $Cat$, $Gpd$, and the category of [[crossed complex]]es; in the latter two cases, it is necessary and sufficient for $f$ to be a [[fibration]], while in $Cat$ it is sufficient for $f$ to be a fibration or an opfibration.
