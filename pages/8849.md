In view of the congruence of the notions of _[[homotopy type]]_ and _[[type]]_ in _[[homotopy type theory]]_ it makes sense to refer to an [[object]] in an [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ which [[categorical semantics|models]] [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] for a kind of _smooth_ cohesion -- such as $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] -- as a _smooth type_. Or _smooth homotopy type_.  Accordingly then an [[n-truncated]] object in $\mathbf{H}$ is a _smooth $n$-type_.

For instance a _smooth 0-type_ is then an object in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow Sh_\infty(CartSp) \simeq \mathbf{H}$. (Also sometumes called a _[[smooth space]]_.)
