## Idea 

The concept of _degree_ of a [[coherent sheaf]] is a generalization of the concept of [[first Chern class]] of a [[line bundle]] (to which it reduces for coherent sheaves of [[sections]] of [[holomorphic line bundles]] over [[Riemann surfaces]] in [[complex analytic geometry]], see at _[first Chern class -- In complex analytic geometry](first+Chern+class#InComplexAnalyticGeometry)_).
