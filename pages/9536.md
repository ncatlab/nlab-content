## Idea

Given a [[manifold]] $X$, there is a [[Hilbert space]] $L^2(X)$ whose elements are square-[[integration|integrable]] [[half-densities]] on $X$, and whose [[inner product]] is given by [[tensor product|tensoring]] two half-densities to an actual [[density]] and then [[integration|integrating]] that over $X$.

This Hilbert space is often called the _canonical Hilbert space_ of $X$, in contrast with the [[L-2-spaces]] $L^2(X,\mu)$ of $\mu$-[[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] [[functions]] for every choice of [[Lebesgue measure]] $\mu$ on $X$.

The notion of canonical Hilbert spaces originates in the context of [[geometric quantization]] in ([Guillemin-Sternberg](#GuilleminSternberg)). It directly corresponds to the "canonical" construction of [[groupoid convolution algebras]] (see there for details) from sections of half-density bundles without choice of a [[Haar measure]].
