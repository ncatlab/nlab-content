## Idea

The relative version of a locally compact topological space is a continuous map that behaves like a 'family of locally compact spaces'.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #ProperContinuous}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f  \colon X \to Y$ is called _locally proper_ if for any $x \in X$ and [[neighbourhood]] $V \ni x$ there is a neighbourhood $A\ni x$ with $A \subset V$ and a neighbourhood $U \ni f(x)$ such that $A \to U$ is a [[proper map]].

=--

## Examples

* The inclusion map of a locally closed subset $C\hookrightarrow X$ in a topological space $X$ is locally proper.

* A topological space $X$ is a [[locally compact space]] if and only if $X\to \ast$ is locally proper.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ be locally proper. Then $g\circ f$ is locally proper. If $W\to Y$ is any continuous function then $W\times_Y Z \to W$ is locally proper. (ie locally proper maps are closed under composition and stable under pullback. Hence they form a singleton [[coverage]])

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a continuous function. Then if

* there is an open covering $\mathcal{U} = \{U_i\}$ of $X$ such that $f\big|_{U_i} \colon U_i \to Y$ is locally proper for all $i$,

or

* there is an open covering $\mathcal{V} = \{V_j\}$ of $Y$ such that $f^{-1}(V_j) \to V_j$ is locally proper for all $j$,

then $f$ is locally proper. The converse implications also hold

Recall that a continuous map $g\colon Y \to Z$ of topological spaces is called _separated_ if $Y\to Y\times_Z Y$ is a closed embedding.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ are continuous maps, $g$ is separated and $g\circ f$ is locally proper, then $f$ is locally proper

###### Corollary

Every continuous map from a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] to a Hausdorff space is separated and locally proper.

=--

The following proposition generalises the well-known result that compact Hausdorff spaces are locally compact.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every separated and proper map is locally proper

=--

The [[proper base change theorem]] also holds for locally proper maps if one uses [[direct image with compact support]] instead of ordinary [[direct image]]
