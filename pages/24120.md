## Definition 

A **cocartesian coclosed category** is a [[locally cocartesian coclosed category]] $C$ with an [[initial object]]. 

## Properties

Any category which is both cartesian closed and co-cartesian co-closed is a preorder, though it may not be the terminal category (e.g., any Boolean algebra is such a category).

+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Let a category be given which is both cartesian closed and co-(cartesian closed). Cartesian closure tells us that the product of any object with the initial object $0$ will be itself initial (as left adjoints preserve colimits).
