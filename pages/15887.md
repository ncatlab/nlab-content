## Idea

The concept of _Prym-Tyurin variety_ or _generalized [[Prym variety]]_ is a slight generalization of that of [[Jacobian variety]] of an [[algebraic curve]].



It is an [[abelian variety]] $Z$ equipped with  [[principally polarized variety|principal polarization]] $\Xi$ such that there exists an [[algebraic curve]] $C$ and an embedding $\iota \colon Z \hookrightarrow Jac(C)$ of $Z$ into its [[Jacobian variety]] such that the pullback of the principal polarization $\Theta$ of $Jac(C)$ along this embedding is an integral fraction of $\Xi$:

$$
  \iota^\ast \Theta = n \Xi
  \,.
$$

Here $n$ is called the _exponent_ of $Z$ in $Jac(C)$.

(e.g. [Birkenhage-Lange](#BirkenhageLange))

## Properties

Any principally polarized abelian variety is a Prym-Tyurin variety for a curve $C$ of sufficiently high [[genus of a curve|genus]].
