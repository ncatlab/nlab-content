## Idea

The [[homological resolution]] of a [[chain complex]] by a complex of [[free modules]].

###### Proposition

For $R$ a [[ring]], every $R$-[[module]] admits a free resolution.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_prop #AbelianGroupHasFreeResolutionOfLength2}
###### Proposition

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], then every [[abelian group]] $A$ admits a free resolution of just length 2, hence with trivial [[syzygies]], hence there exists a [[short exact sequence]] of abelian groups of the form

$$
  0 \to F_2 \longrightarrow F_1 \longrightarrow A \to 0
$$

where both $F_1$ and $F_2$ are [[free abelian groups]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $F_1 = \mathbb{Z}[A]$ be the [[free abelian group]] on the underlying [[set]] of $A$, and let $F_1 \to A$ be the canonical morphism that sends a generator to itself (the [[adjunction counit]] of the [[free-forgetful adjunction]]).

Then let $F_2 \to F_1$ be the [[kernel]] of that map, hence $F_2$ a [[subgroup]] of $F_1$. Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] then every [[subgroup]] of a [[free abelian group]] is itself free abelian, hence $F_2$ is free abelian ([prop.](free+abelian+group#SubgroupsOfFreeAbelianGroupsAreFree)).

###### Remark

Prop. \ref{AbelianGroupHasFreeResolutionOfLength2} implies that all [[Ext]]-groups between abelian groups are concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. 

(By the discussion at _[[derived functor in homological algebra]]_.)

###### Example
**([[Koszul complex]] is free resolution of [[quotient ring]])

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]] and $(x_1, \cdots, x_d)$ a [[regular sequence]] of elements, then the [[Koszul complex]] $K(x_1, \cdots, x_d)$ is a free resolutions of the [[quotient ring]] $R/(x_1, \cdots, x_d)$ by free $R$-modules.
