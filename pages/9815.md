## Idea

Where the [[category of pure motives]] has [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]] as its [[objects]], the _category of mixed motives_ is supposed to be constructed from all [[smooth varieties]].  

The category of mixed motives is supposed to be an [[abelian category|abelian]] [[tensor category]] which contains the [[pure motives]] as the [[full subcategory]] of [[semisimple objects]].  

So far there is no realisation of such a category, but there are proposals by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] and [[Marc Levine]] of [[triangulated categories]] that behave as its [[derived category]] is expected to.
