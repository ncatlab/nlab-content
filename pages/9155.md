## Idea

A central aspect of [[quantum field theory]] usually desired or demanded or expected of _fundamental_ QFTs is that it is _local_ in the rough sense that 

* there is no "action at a distance", but all influences propagate (on a [[Lorentzian manifold]]) at some finite speed (that of light, usually);

* phenomena of large scale [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] are entirely determined by phenomena on smaller scales;

* (space-like) separated regions of [[spacetime]] behave like [independent subsystems](quantum+mechanics#Subsystems) ([[causal locality]]).

In some [[effective quantum field theories]] locality may be violated, if fundamental local processes are averaged out to a single non-local macroscopic process, but for _fundamental_ physics of the [[observable universe]] it is thought to hold.

### Formalization in quantum field theory

Locality is formalized in the two main axiomatizations of quantum field theory as follows.

* In [[AQFT]] the [[algebras of observables]] are required to form a _[[local net]]_ meaning that 

  1. there is one such algebra assigned to each suitable subset of spacetime, compatible with inclusion of such subsets, 

  1. that under these inclusions algebras associated to spacelike separated regions commute with each other.

  Often in the literature the term "local quantum field theory" is meant to refer specifically to these [[AQFT]] axioms (some authors use the terms synonymously, dating from a time when this was the only axiomatization of quantum field theory considered.)

* In [[FQFT]] locality is encoded in the [[functor]]-property of the functor on the [[category of cobordisms]]: being a functor means that the assignment to a cobordism $\Sigma$ is obtained by composing the assignments to any decomposition of $\Sigma$ into small cobordisms. In particular, in _[[extended quantum field theory]]_ (now also sometimes called "fully localized" QFT) this is [[(infinity,n)-functor|n-functorial]] meaning that this gluing condition holds in all dimensions and in all directions.

### Formalization in pre-quantum field theory

There are also properties of locality in _[[prequantum field theory]]_.

A _[[Lagrangian]]_ is called a _[[local Lagrangian]]_ if it "depends only on finitely many [[derivatives]] of the fields" at each point, which formally means that it is a horizontal form on the [[jet bundle]] of the [[field bundle]]. Local Lagrangians are expected to yield local quantum field theories under [[quantization]].

Here, too, one can consider the analog of [[extended quantum field theory]] and ask for _[[extended Lagrangians]]_ that are not only local as top-degree forms on [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]], but which also have an "extension" to lower dimensional subspaces.
