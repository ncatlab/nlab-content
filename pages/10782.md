## Idea

$\ell$-Adic cohomology is a [[cohomology theory]] on suitable [[varieties]] which is constructed as an [[inverse limit]] of [[étale cohomology]] over different [[coefficients]].

$\ell$-Adic cohomology is a [[Weil cohomology theory]]

## Definition

Let $X$ be a (smooth?) [[proper map|proper]] [[variety]] over a field. Fix $\ell$ a [[prime number]] different from the [[characteristic]] of $k$. The $\ell$-adic cohomology is defined to be the [[cohomology theory]] on the [[etale site]] given by the [[inverse limit]] over $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  H^j_{et}(X_{\overline{k}}, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)
  \coloneqq
 \lim_n 
  H^j_{et}(X_{\overline{k}}, \mathbb{Z}/\ell^n\mathbb{Z})\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}} \mathbb{Q}_\ell
$$

of [[étale cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}/\ell^n\mathbb{Z}$.

The key insights into getting finite dimensionality with coefficients in a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] $0$ when $k$ has positive characteristic is to first base change to $\overline{k}$ to make the theory "geometric." Then only work with torsion sheaves so that appropriate finiteness theorems for [[étale cohomology]] of proper varieties can be used, and then pass to the limit.
