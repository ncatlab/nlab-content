## Idea

In general, a _domain wall_ is a [[QFT with defects|defect]] of [[codimension]] 1.

More specifically, in a [[gauge theory]] with a degenerate [[vacuum]] (such as when a [[Higgs mechanism]] applies), the [[moduli space]] of [[vacua]] is the [[quotient]] $G/H$ (the [[coset]]) of the [[gauge group]] $G$ by the [[stabilizer subgroup]] $H \hookrightarrow G$ of any of these vacua ([[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]).

This means that gauge equivalence classes of vaccum configurations on a [[spacetime]] $X$ are given by [[homotopy]] classes of maps $X \to \Pi(G/H)$ (where the notation on the right denotes the underlying [[homotopy type]] of the [[coset]] space, $\Pi$ is the [[shape modality]]).

If [[spacetime]] is locally to be taken of the form $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}^3 - D^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2)$, hence with a 1-dimensional ("wall"-like) piece taken out, them homotopy classes of maps $X \to \Pi(G/H)$ are classified by the 0-th [[homotopy group]] $\pi_0(G/H)$. For a given nontrivial element here the correponding [[vacuum]] is said to contain a **domain wall defect**.
