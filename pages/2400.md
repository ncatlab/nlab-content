## Intro Part I: basics of moduli stacks of curves {#intropart1}


**question**: what is a **moduli problem**?

* some kind of object;

* a notion of "familiy"/"deformation" of these objects

* some [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ (possibly trivial)
  on the set of families $S(B)$ over $B$

from this we get a [[functor]] (a [[presheaf]])

$$
  F : C^{op} \to Set
$$

$$
  B \mapsto S(B)/_\sim
$$

**terminology** an object $M$ is called a [[fine moduli space]] if the corresponding [[representable functor|represented functor]]

$$
  Y_M : C^{op} \to Set
$$

$$
  x \mapsto Hom(x,M)
$$

is isomorphic to $F$, i.e. if it represents $F$.

**examples** in the [[homotopy category]] of [[topological space]]s we have

$$
  \left\{
    complex line bundles over B
  \right\}/isom
  \leftrightarrow
  Hom_{Ho(Top)}(B, \mathbb{C}P^\infty)
$$

so $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is a [[classifying space]] for complex line bundle.

Why are [[fine moduli space]]s desireable?

they allow to study a _single_ family which tells us universal things about all families.

**example** studying the [[cohomology ring]]s of $Gr_n(\mathbb{R}^\infty)$ or $Gr_n(\mathbb{C}^\infty)$, which are the classifying space for higher rank real and complex [[vector bundle]]s gives universal relations among [[Chern class]]es, etc.

Let's look at [[elliptic curve]]s (work over $\mathbb{C}$).

the functor of families here is 

$$
  F : Sch/\mathbb{C}^{op} \to Set
$$

$$
  B \mapsto \left\{
     \array{
        E \\ \downarrow \\ B
     }
     flat families of elliptic curves
  \right\}
$$

**Fact**: there is no [[fine moduli space]] of [[elliptic curve]]s representing this functor

**why not?** 

there is something called the  [[j-invariant]] which classifies [[elliptic curve]]s up to [[isomorphism]]

let 

$$
  E : y^2 0 x^3 + a x + b
$$

be an [elliptic curve]] given by parameters $a,b$. Then its [[j-invariant]] is the number

$$
  j(E) = \frac{2^8 3^3 a^3}{4 a^3 + 27 b^2}
$$

so we might guess that the "$j$-line" $\mathbb{A}^1$ is a [[fine moduli space]] for [[elliptic curve]]s,

i.e. that there is a "universal family" of elliptic curves $C \to \mathbb{A}^1$ such that the fiber over $j \in \mathbb{A}^1$ is the elliptic cuvre with that $j$-invariant.

so that for any family $E \to B$ we'd have a [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    E &\to& C
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\to& \mathbb{A}^1
  }
$$

where $B \to \mathbb{A}^1$ sends a point in $B$ to the [[j-invariant]] of the elliptic curve in the fiber over $B$.

Now consider the family 

$$
  \chi = (y^2 = x(x-1)(x+\lambda)) \subset \mathbb{A}^1 \times \mathbb{A}_\lambda^1 \times \mathbb{P}^2
$$

$$
  \array{
    \chi &\to& C
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{A}^1_\lambda &\to& \mathbb{A}^1
  }
$$

$$
  j(\chi_\lambda) = s^8 \frac{(\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1)^2}{\lambda^2(\lambda-1)^2}
$$


now send $\mathbb{A}^1_\lambda \to \mathbb{A}^1_{\lambda}$

by dually sending $\lambda \mapsto 1-\lambda$  

check if $j(\chi_\lambda) = j(\chi_{1-\lambda})$


this induces in the fibers a map

$\phi : \chi \to \chi$

$$
  \phi : (x,y,\lambda) \mapsto (1-x,\pm i y , 1-\lambda)
$$

this maps further to $(x,-y,\lambda)$. But this would have to be the identity for $\mathbb{A}^1$ to be a fine moduli space, which it is not. So $\mathbb{A}^1$ at least is not a fine moduli space, even though it might look like one.

so that gives some computational insight that something goes wrong

**abstract argument** generally, fine moduli spaces do not existt if the objects to be classified have nontrivial [[automorphism]]s. This allows to build families of objects that are locally trivial but globally not and no finite moduli space will be able to represent that.

>this argument makes use of the fact that if we have a moduli space, then the preshesaf we started with must actually be a [[sheaf]] (with respect to a [[subcanonical topology]] that is implicitly assumed, probably). so we know that we should be able to compute it from gluing its localassignments. But locally our locally trivial family looks, well, trivial, so it all looks the same to our sheaf. So it will just try to glue the trivial object to itself, which is not what we actually have.

**General principle** [[automorphism]]s of objects are obsztructions to the existence of an (ordinary) [[fine moduli space]] classifying these objects.


**How to "fix" these problems**. 

1. add extra structure to the objects under consideration (add marked points)

1. instead of looking for representing [[topological space]]s, look for representing [[groupoid]]s / [[stack]]s.

3. use [[coarse moduli space]]s  $M \in Sch/\mathbb{C}$ with $\Psi_M : F \to h_M$ such that 

   a) $F(Spec(\mathbb{C})) \to h_M(Spec \mathbb{C}) = hom(Spec \mathbb{C}, M)$ is a [[bijection]]
 
   b) given $M'$ and $\Psi_{M'} : F \to h_{M'}$ then there exists unique $M \to M'$ such that $\array{ F && \stackrel{\Psi_{M'}}{\to}&& h_{M'} \\ & {}_{\Psi_M}\searrow && \nearrow \\ && h_M} $

   so a [[coarse moduli space]] is one that at least has the right underlying set of points as the _right_ [[moduli stack]] has: as long as we don't look at families but just at single things, it does give the right classification.



**exercise** show that the $j$-line $\mathbb{A}^1$ _is_, while not a [[fine moduli space]], a [[coarse moduli space]]

**fact** there exists a [[coarse moduli space]] $M_{g,n}$ of [[Riemann surface]]s of [[genus]] $g$ with $n$ marked points and a [[fine moduli stack]] $M_{g,n}$ such that for all $g,n$ we have

$M_{g,n}$ is a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[Deligne-Mumford stack]] - aka [[orbifold]]

**except** for $(g,n) =$ $(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0)$ (these are the cases where the [[automorphism group]] is infinite, so in these cases we don't get a [[Deligne-Mumford stack]])

**Issues**:

1. $M_{g,n}$ is not proper, meaning: not compact, so we don't have [[Poincare duality]] on $M_{g,n}$ and no [[integration]] theory

1. sometimes one wants to study singular curvesor families with degeneracies.

Both "issues" can be "resolved" via [[Deligne-Mumford compactification]].

$$
  \bar M_{g,n}
$$

which parameterizes at-most-nodal curves, that are connected, arithmetic, of [[genus]] $g$, with $n$ smooth marked points, and the group of [[automorphism]]s is finite.

$\bar M_{g,n}$ is a smooth proper [[Deligne-Mumford stack]].

smooth here means smoothness as for [[orbifold]]s.



#Intro Part II: basics of Gromov-Witten theory{#intropart2}

**Gromov** was looking for invariants of [[symplectic manifold]]s: he used $j$-holomorphic curves in compact symplectic manifolds to get symplectic invariants

**[[Edward Witten]]** studied [[worldsheet]]s of [[string theory|string]]s in some [[spacetime]] [[manifold]] (e.g a [[Calabi-Yau space|Calabi-Yau 3-fold]])

we want to consider  now [[genus]] $g$ [[Riemann surface]]s with $n$ marked points mapping into some space $X$

$$
  M_{g,n}(X,\beta)
$$

is the space that parameterizes tuples consisting of homology classes

$$
  \beta \in H_2(X, \mathbb{Z})
$$

and maps

$$
  \Sigma \stackrel{f}{\to} X
$$

such that for $[\Sigma]$ the [[fundamental homology class]] of $\Sigma$ we have

$$
  f_*[\Sigma] = \beta
  \,.
$$

this is a smooth [[Deligne-Mumford stack]].

similarly, write $\bar M_{g,n}(X,\beta)$ for the same setup but with $\Sigma$ from $\bar M_{g,n}$ as above in part 1 (de DM compactified moduli stack).

this is a _compact_ [[Deligne-Mumford stack]] - but _not_ smooth (not even in the sense of smooth stacks)

we have

$$
  \bar M_{g,n}(pt,0) = \bar M_{g,n}
$$

what to [[string theory|string theorists]] want to do? 

we have evaluation maps

$$
  \bar M_{g,n}(X,\beta) \stackrel{ev_i}{\to} X
$$

where $i$ labels a marked point, and we want morphisms

$$
  H^\bullet(X)^{\otimes n}
  \stackrel{ev^*_1 \wedge ev^*_2 \wedge \cdots}{\to}
  H^*(\bar M_{g,n}(X,\beta))
  \stackrel{\int_{[\bar M_{g,n}(x,\beta)]^{virtual}}}{\to}
  \mathbb{C}
$$

**string theorists conjectured** : there exists a virtual fundamental class $[\bar M_{g,n}(x,\beta)]^{virtual}$ that makes the maps above into the [[correlation function]]s of a [[quantum field theory]] (the integral would be the [[path integral]] of the [[worldsheet]] [[sigma-model]])

the mathematical structure of GW-theory was elucidated by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and Manin in 1994.

$$
  \array{
    \bar M_{g,n}(X,\beta)
    \\
    \downarrow^\phi
    \\
    \bar M_{g,n}
  }
$$

$$
  I_{g,n,\beta} : 
  H^*(X)^{\otimes}
  \to
  H^*(\bar M_{g,n}(X,\beta))
  \stackrel{\phi_*}{\to}
  H^*(\bar M_{g,n})
$$

where $\phi_*$ is some kind of "pushforward" or "integration along the fibers"

there is also a map

$$
  \alpha
  :
  \bar M_{g_1,n_1+1}
  \times
  \bar M_{g_2,n_2+1}
  \to
  \bar M_{g,n}
$$

with $g = g_1 + g_2$ and $n = n_1 + n_2$ obtained by attaching a marked point with one on the other curve.


so consider now the combination of these two maps

$$ 
  \array{
    H^\bullet(X)^{\otimes}
    &\stackrel{I_{g,n,\beta} }{\to}&
    H^\bullet(\bar M_{g,n}(X,\beta))
   \stackrel{\phi_*}{\to}
   H^*(\bar M_{g,n})
   \\
   \downarrow^{- \otimes \Delta \otimes -}
   &&
   \downarrow^\alpha
   \\   
   H^\bullet(X)^{\otimes n_1}
  \otimes H^\bullet(X) \otimes
   H^\bullet(X) \otimes H^\bullet(X)^{\otimes n_2}
   && 
   H^{\bullet}(\bar M_{g_1,n_1+1} \times \bar M_{g_2,n_2+1})
   \\
   \downarrow^\simeq
   && \downarrow^{\simeq} 
   \\
   H^\bullet(X)^{\otimes n_1 + 1}
   \otimes
   H^\bullet(X)^{\otimes n_2 + 1}    
   &\stackrel{I_{g_1,n_1+1} \otimes I_{g_2,n_2+1}}{\to}&
   H^{\bullet}(\bar M_{g_1,n_1+1}) \otimes H^\bullet (\bar M_{g_2,n_2+1}))
   }
  $$

where the bottom right iso uses the [[Kunneth formula]]

here $\Delta_a$ is a homogeneous basis of $H^\bullet(X)$

$$
  g_{a b} = \int_X \Delta_a \wedge \Delta_b
$$

$$
  \Delta = \sum g^{a b} \Delta_a \wedge \Delta_b
$$

where

$$
  g^{a b} = (g_{a b})^{-1}
$$

so this diagram above says that this satisfies the [[sewing law]]s that defines a [[quantum field theory]]
