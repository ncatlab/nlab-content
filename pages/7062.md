## Idea

The _interval type_ is an [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the cellular [[interval object]] in the context of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Definition

As a [[higher inductive type]], the interval is given by

    Inductive Interval : Type
      | left : Interval
      | right : Interval
      | segment : Id Interval left right

This says that the type is inductive constructed from two [[terms]] in the interval, whose [[semantics|interpretation]] is as the endpoints of the interval, together with a term in the [[identity type]] of paths between these two terms, which interprets as the 1-cell of the interval

$$
  left \stackrel{segment}{\to} right
  \,.
$$

## Properties

* An interval type is provably [[contractible type|contractible]].  Conversely, any contractible type satisfies the rules of an interval type up to propositional equality.

* On the other hand, postulating an interval type with *definitional* computation rules for `left` and `right` implies [[function extensionality]]. ([Shulman](#Shulman)).
