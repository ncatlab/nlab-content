## Idea

In a [[category of chain complexes]] $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, the [[suspension object]] of a [[chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ is the complex 

$$
  \Sigma C_\bullet = C[1]_\bullet
$$

(or sometimes denoted $C[-1]_\bullet$, depending on an unessential choice of sign convention) obtained by shifting the [[graded object|degrees]] up by one:

$$
  C[1]_n \coloneqq C_{n-1}
$$

with the [[differential]] the original one but equipped with a sign:

$$
  d^{X[1]}_n \coloneqq - d^X_{n-1}
  \,.
$$

Generally for $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ $C[p]$ is the chain complex with

$$
  C[p]_n \coloneqq C_{n-p}
$$

$$
  d^{X[p]}_n \coloneqq (-1)^p d^X_{n-p}
  \,.
$$
