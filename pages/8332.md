## Idea

In a [[category of chain cmplexes]] $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$, the [[suspension object]] of a [[chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ is the complex 

$$
  \Sigma C_\bullet = C[1]_\bullet
$$

(or sometimes denoted $C[-1]_\bullet$, depending on an unessential choice of convention) obtained by shifting the [[graded object|degrees]] up by one:

$$
  C[1]_n \coloneqq C_{n-1}
  \,.
$$
