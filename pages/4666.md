## Definition

The __trivial group__ is the [[group]] whose underlying [[set]] is the [[singleton]], hence whose only [[element]] is the [[neutral element]].

In the context of [[nonabelian groups]] the trivial group is usually denoted $1$, while in the context of [[abelian groups]] it is usually denoted $0$ (being the [[zero object]]) and also called the *zero group* (notably in [[homological algebra]]).   

The trivial group is a [[zero object]] (both [[initial object|initial]] and [[terminal object|terminal]]) of [[Grp]].

## Examples

The trivial group is a [[subgroup]] of any other group, and the corresponding inclusion $1 \hookrightarrow G$ is the unique such group homomorpism.

The [[quotient group]] of any [[group]] $G$ by itself is the trivial group: $G/G = 1$, and the quotient projection $G \to G/G =1$ is the unique such group homomorphism. 

It can be nontrivial to decide from a [[group presentation]] whether a group so presented is trivial, and in fact the general problem is [[decidability|undecidable]]. See also [[combinatorial group theory]] and [[word problem]].  

## Properties

The trivial group is an example of a [[trivial algebra]].
