## Idea

A [[Riemannian manifold]] with [[special holonomy]] [[G2]].


## Applications

### In supergravity 

In [[string phenomenology]] [[model (in particle phyiscs)|models]] obtained from [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] on $G_2$-manifolds (see for instance [Duff](#Duff)) can have attractive phenomenological properties, see for instance the _[[G2-MSSM]]_.
