## Idea

A _$G_2$-structure_ on a [[manifold]] of [[dimension]] 7 is a choice of [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[tangent bundle]] along the inclusion of [[G2]] into $GL(7)$.

Given that $G_2$ is the [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^7$ which preserves the [[associative 3-form]] on $\mathbb{R}^7$, a $G_2$ structre is a higher analog of an  [[almost symplectic structure]] under lifting from [[symplectic geometry]] to [[2-plectic geometry]] ([Ibort](#Ibort)).

A _$G_2$-manifold_ is a manifold equipped with an "integrable" or "parallel" $G_2$-structure. This is equivalently a [[Riemannian manifold]] of [[dimension]] 7 with [[special holonomy]] group being the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2]]. 

$G_2$-manifolds may be understood as 7-dimensional analogs of real 6-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]].

## Definition

### $G_2$-structure

+-- {: .num_defn #G2Structure}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $7$ a **$G_2$-structure** on $X$ is a [[G-structure]] for $G = $ [[G2]] $\hookrightarrow GL(7)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #CanonicalRiemannianMetric}
###### Remark

A $G_2$-structure in particular implies an [[orthogonal structure]], hence a [[Riemannian metric]].


=--

### $G_2$-holonomy

+-- {: .num_defn #G2manifold}
###### Definition

A manifold equipped with a $G_2$-structure $\omega$, def. \ref{G2Structure}, is called a **$G_2$-manifold** if $\omega$ is "parallel" or "integrable" in that 

1. $d \omega = 0$ 

1. $d \star \omega = 0$

(where $d$ is the [[de Rham differential]] and $\star$ is the [[Hodge star operator]] of the canonical [[Riemannian metric]] of remark \ref{CanonicalRiemannianMetric}).

=--

For instance ([Joyce, p. 4](#Joyce)).


The [[holonomy]] of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on a $G_2$-manifold is contained in $G_2$.

### Weak $G_2$-holonomy
 {#WeakG2Holonomy}

There is a useful weakened notion of $G_2$-holonomy. 

+-- {: .num_defn #WeakG2Holonomy}
###### Definition

A 7-dimensional manifold is said to be of _weak $G_2$-holonomy_ if it carries a 3-form $\omega$ with the relation of def. \ref{G2manifold} generalized to

$$
  d \omega = \lambda \star \omega
$$

and hence

$$
  d \star \omega = 0
$$

for $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. For $\lambda = 0$ this reduces to strict $G_2$-holonomy, by \ref{G2manifold}.

## Properties

### Existence

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A 7-manifold admits a $G_2$-structure, def. \ref{G2Structure}, precisely if it admits a [[spin structure]].

=--

### Metric structure

The canonical [[Riemannian metric]] $G_2$ manifold is [[Ricci tensor|Ricci flat]]. More generally a manifold of weak $G_2$-holonomy, def. \ref{WeakG2Holonomy}, with weakness parameter $\lambda$ is an [[Einstein manifold]] with [[cosmological constant]] $\lambda$. 

## Applications

### In supergravity 

In [[string phenomenology]] [[model (in particle phyiscs)|models]] obtained from [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory on G2-manifolds]] (see for instance [Duff](#Duff)) can have attractive [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] properties, see for instance the _[[G2-MSSM]]_.
