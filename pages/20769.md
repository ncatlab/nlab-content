## Idea
 {#Idea}

Stably compact spaces are [[topological spaces]] which share many of the desirable properties of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]], such as [[compactness]] and [[local compactness]], without being [[Hausdorff]] or even [[T1]]. 

They are also a convenient setting for [[convergence]] in an [[order theory|ordered]] setting, being deeply linked to [[compact ordered spaces]].

## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called **stably compact** if the following conditions are met:

* $X$ is [[T0]];
* $X$ is [[compact]];
* $X$ is [[locally compact]];
* $X$ is [[sober]];
* $X$ is **coherent**, meaning that the intersection of two [[compact]] [[saturated set|saturated]] subsets is compact. 

Note that the latter notion of coherence is slightly different than the one given at [[coherent space]].
