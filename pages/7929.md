
A __zero function__ is a [[constant function]] whose constant value is [[zero]].

Formally, if $X$ is a [[set]] and $Y$ is a [[pointed set]] with [[basepoint]] $0$, then the __zero function__ from $X$ to $Y$ is
$$ 0\colon X \to Y\colon t \mapsto 0 .$$

If $X$ is also pointed, then the zero function must preserve basepoints, making this a case of a [[zero morphism]].  However, $X$ need not be pointed for the zero function to make sense.
