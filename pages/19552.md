## Idea

Given some [[algebra|algebraic]] object like an [[associative algebra]] or [[group]] or [[Lie algebra]], with a notion of _[[central extension]]_, one may ask for the largest possible such, the _maximal central extension_. In good situations (...) this coincides with the _[[universal central extension]]_.

>  The lower central series of the absolute Galois group of a field is obtained by iterating the process of forming the maximal central extension of  the maximal nilpotent extension of a given class, starting with the maximal   abelian extension. The  purpose of this paper is to give a  cohomological   description of this central series in case of an algebraic number field.
