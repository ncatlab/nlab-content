## Idea

This is a seemingly new notion (this is not exactly the same thing than a graded Hopf algebra without antipode) usefull in the context of [[graded codifferential category]] and to characterize symmetric powers.

A graded bimonoid in a $CMon$-enriched symmetric monoidal category is given by a family $(A_{n})$ of objects, a family $(A_{n} \otimes A_{p} \rightarrow A_{n+p})$ of morphisms and a family $(A_{n+p} \rightarrow A_{n} \otimes A_{p})$ of morphisms which verify some coherences.
