## Idea

A graded bimonoid is like a [[bimonoid]] but graded, as a [[graded monoid]]. We don't look as an object $A$ but as a [[graded object]] $(A_{n})_{n \ge 0}$. The multiplication, comultiplication, unit and counit are defined as morphisms which respect the grading.

## Definition

A graded bimonoid in a [[CMon-enriched symmetric monoidal category]] is given by a family $(A_{n})_{n \ge 0}$ of objects, a family $(\nabla_{n,p}:A_{n} \otimes A_{p} \rightarrow A_{n+p})_{n,p \ge 0}$ of morphisms, a family $(\Delta_{n,p}:A_{n+p} \rightarrow A_{n} \otimes A_{p})_{n,p \ge 0}$ of morphisms, a morphism $\eta:I \rightarrow A_{0}$ and a morphism $\epsilon:A_{0} \rightarrow I$ which verify some coherences (often, we don't write the indexes under $\Delta$ or $\nabla$):

* $((A_{n})_{n \ge 0},(\nabla_{n,p})_{n,p \ge 0}, \eta)$ is a [[graded monoid]]
* $((A_{n})_{n \ge 0},(\Delta_{n,p})_{n,p \ge 0}), \epsilon)$ is a [[graded comonoid]]
* Compatibility multiplication/comultiplication:

If $n,p,q,r \ge 0$ are such that $n+p=q+r$ ($n$ must be read as $A_{n}$ in the string diagrams):

* Compatibility counit/multiplication:

\begin{tikzcd}
A_{0} \otimes A_{0} \arrow[rr, "\nabla"] \arrow[rd, "\epsilon \otimes \epsilon"'] &                     & A_{0} \arrow[ld, "\epsilon"] \\
                                                                                  & I \otimes I \cong I &                             
\end{tikzcd}

* Compatibility unit/comultiplication:

\begin{tikzcd}
I \cong I \otimes I \arrow[rd, "\eta \otimes \eta"] \arrow[d, "\eta"'] &                     \\
A_{0} \arrow[r, "\Delta"']                                             & A_{0} \otimes A_{0}
\end{tikzcd}

* Compatibility unit/counit:

\begin{tikzcd}
I \arrow[d, "\eta"'] \arrow[rd, "Id"] &   \\
A_{0} \arrow[r, "\epsilon"']          & I
\end{tikzcd}
