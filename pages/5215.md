## The epistemic logics $S5$ and $S5_{(m)}$## 
(Note that $S5 = S5_{(1)}$.)

Although better than $K$ (resp. $K(m)$), and $T$ (resp. $T(m)$), $S4$ (resp. $S4(m)$) is still not considered adequate for knowledge representation.  Because of this further axioms have been put forward, too many to be mentioned here.  We will limit ourselves, (at this stage in the development of these entries, at least) to introducing one more axiom, that is a bit more contentious but is nice from the nPOV. 


## The axioms $B_i$## 

The axiom denoted $B_i$, (and again refer to Kracht for some indication of possible reasons) is 

* $p \to K_i M_i p$.

Another axiom that is relevant here is:

## The axioms $(5)_i$## 

* $M_i p \to K_i M_i p$

## The logics $S5$ and $S5_{(m)}$
* $S5$ - this logic is obtained from $S4$ by adding the axiom $B$.

* $S5_{(m)}$ starting from $S4_{(m)}$, add, for each $i = 1,\ldots, m$ the axiom $B_i$.


In either case the same result can be obtained by adding in $5$ or $(5)_i$ in place of the correponding $B$.
