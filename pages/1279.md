Sequent calculus was introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in his 1933 thesis as a formal system for studying the properties of proof systems presented in the style of [[natural deduction]] (also introduced by Gentzen).  It has since been widely adopted over natural deduction in proof theory and automated theorem proving.

The most important property of sequent-calculus proofs is that every formula occuring anywhere in a proof is a subformula of a formula contained in the conclusion of the proof (the _subformula property_).  This makes induction over proof-trees much more straightforward than with natural deduction or other systems.
