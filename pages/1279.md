## Definition

Given a [[signature (in logic)]] $\Sigma$, a **[[sequent]]** over $\Sigma$ is a formal expresssion of the form

$$
  \phi \vdash_{\vec x} \psi
  \,,
$$

where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are [[formula]]s over $\Sigma$ and $\vec x$ is a [[context]].  Sometimes one allows $\phi$, or both $\phi$ and $\psi$, to be finite *lists* of formulas rather than single formulas.  In [[type theory]], $\vec x$ and a list of hypotheses $\phi$ can be combined into a single context.

A [[theory]] formulated in $\Sigma$ is given by collection of sequents called the theory's [[axiom]]s.

A sequent is called a **regular sequent** or **coherent sequent** etc., if $\phi$ and $\psi$ are formulas in [[regular logic]] or [[coherent logic]] etc. , respectively.

## Sequent calculus

_Sequent calculus_ is a _proof system_, in which provability in many different logics can be formulated. 

### Definition

The basic building blocks of a sequent-calculus proof are  **inference rules**,  which are rules for inferring the validity of certain sequents from other sequents. One writes

$$
  \frac{\Gamma}{\sigma}
$$

where $\Gamma$ is a (possibly empty) list of sequents and $\sigma$ is a single sequent, to indicate that from the validity of the sequents in $\Gamma$ that of $\sigma$ may be inferred, or that $\Gamma$ may be _rewritten_ to $\sigma$.

A **derivation** or **proof tree** is a compound of rewrite rules, such as

$$
  \frac{\frac{\sigma_1 \;\; \sigma_2}{\sigma_3} \;\; \sigma_4 }{\sigma_5}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition
The following are the **structural rules** of sequent calculus, and are essentially the same no matter what logic is being formalised.

* The **identity axiom** is

  $$
    \frac{}{\phi \vdash_{\vec x} \phi}
     \,.
  $$

* The **substitution rule** is

  $$
    \frac{
      \phi \vdash_{\vec x} \psi
    }{
      \phi [\vec s / \vec x] \vdash_{\vec y} 
      \psi [\vec s / \vec x]
    }
    \,,
  $$

  where $\vec y$ is any string of [[variable]]s including that of the terms $\vec s$ and $\phi [\vec s / \vec x]$ is the [[predicate]] obtained from $\phi$ by substituting $\vec s$ for $\vec x$, etc.  Of course, this rule is only included if the formulas of the logic in question may contain terms.

* The **cut rule** is

  $$
    \frac{
      (\phi \vdash_{\vec x} \psi) \;\;\; (\psi \vdash_{\vec x} \chi)
    }{
      \phi \vdash_{\vec x} \chi
   }\,.
  $$

### Cut rule and cut-free proofs

The cut rule expresses the composition of proofs.  Gentzen's main result ([Gentzen, Haupsatz](#Gentzen)) is that any sequent proof that uses the cut rule can be transformed into one that doesn't.  This yields a normalization algorithm for proofs, which provided much of the inspiration behind [[Lambek]]'s approach to categorical logic.

The most important property of cut-free proofs is that every formula occuring anywhere in a proof is a subformula of a formula contained in the conclusion of the proof (the _subformula property_).  This makes induction over proof-trees much more straightforward than with natural deduction or other systems.

as a formal system for studying the properties of proof systems presented in the style of [[natural deduction]] (also introduced by Gentzen).  It has since been widely adopted over natural deduction in proof theory and automated theorem proving.
