## Definition

Given a [[signature (in logic)]] $\Sigma$, a **sequent** over $\Sigma$ is a formal expresssion of the form

$$
  \phi \vdash_{\vec x} \psi
  \,,
$$

where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are [[formlula]]s over $\Sigma$ and $\vec x$ is a [[context]].

A [[theory]] formulated in $\Sigma$ is given by collection of sequents called the theory's [[axiom]]s.

A sequent is called a **regular sequent** or **coherent sequent** etc., if $\phi$ and $\psi$ are formulas in [[regular logic]] or [[coherent logic]] etc. , respectively.

## Sequent caluclus

Sequent calculus was introduced by Gerhard Gentzen in his 1933 thesis as a formal system for studying the properties of proof systems presented in the style of [[natural deduction]] (also introduced by Gentzen).  It has since been widely adopted over natural deduction in proof theory and automated theorem proving.

The sequent calculus incorporates the _cut rule_, which allows for the composition of proofs.  Gentzen's main result (the _Hauptsatz_) was that any sequent proof that uses the cut rule can be transformed into one that doesn't.  This yields a normalization algorithm for proofs, which provided much of the inspiration behind Lambek's approach to categorical logic.

The most important property of cut-free proofs is that every formula occuring anywhere in a proof is a subformula of a formula contained in the conclusion of the proof (the _subformula property_).  This makes induction over proof-trees much more straightforward than with natural deduction or other systems.
