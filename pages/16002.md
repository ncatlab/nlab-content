## Idea

A _germ of a space_ is an [[equivalence class]] of [[pointed spaces]], where two such spaces regarded as equivalent if they are isomorphic on small [[open neighbourhoods]] of the base points.

## Definition

The category of germs of spaces has as objects pointed spaces $(X,x_0)$, where _space_ may depend on the context ([[topological space]], [[complex manifold]], ...).

Morphisms $(X,x_0) \to (Y,y_0)$ are equivalence classes of basepoint-preserving morphisms $U \to Y$ defined on arbitrary open neighbourhoods $U$ of $x_0$. Two such morphisms are considered equal if they agree on an open neighbourhood of $x_0$ contained in the intersection of their domains.

## Examples

Let $f$ be a [[germ|germ of a holomorphic function]] on a complex manifold $X$, defined on an open neighbourhood $U$ of some point $x_0$. Then the vanishing set of $f$, $V(f) \coloneqq \{ x \in U \,|\, f(x) = 0 \}$, is not well-defined as a space. However, it gives rise to a well-defined germ of a space.

The base space of a [[universal deformation]] of a complex manifold is usually considered as a germ of a space.

## As a localization

The category of germs of space is the [[localization]] of the category of pointed spaces at the class of those morphisms which restrict to isomorphisms on open neighbourhoods of the basepoints.
