[arXiv:0904.4103](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0904.4103) Gysin map and Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
from arXiv Front: math.KT by Fabio Ferrari Ruffino
We discuss the relations between the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence and
the Gysin map for a multiplicative cohomology theory, on spaces having the
homotopy type of a finite CW-complex. In particular, let us fix such a
multiplicative cohomology theory h* and let us consider a smooth manifold X of
dimension n and a compact submanifold Y of dimension p, satisfying suitable
hypotheses about orientability. We prove that, starting the Atiyah-Hirzebruch
spectral sequence with the Poincarè dual of Y in X, which, in our setting, is
a simplicial cohomology class with coefficients in h^{n-p}(one-point), if such
a class survives until the last step, it is represented by the image via the
Gysin map of the unit cohomology class of Y. We then prove the analogous
statement for a generic cohomology class on Y.
