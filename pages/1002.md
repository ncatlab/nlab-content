## Definitions

An __ultrafilter__ on a set $S$ is a collection $F$ of [[subset]]s of $S$ satisfying the axiom
$$ A \in F \;\Leftrightarrow\; \forall (B_1, \ldots, B_n \in F),\; \exists (x \in A \cap B_1 \cap \cdots \cap B_n) .$$
This is the only axiom necessary; from this, you can prove that $F$ is a [[filter]].

Using [[excluded middle]], it is equivalent to say that a filter $F$ is an ultrafilter if, given any subset $A$ of $S$, either $A$ or its complement belongs to $F$.  This version generalises to any [[Boolean algebra]].  Another way to define an ultrafilter _in_ a Boolean algebra $L$ is as a Boolean-algebra homomorphism from $L$ to the set $\{\bot,\top\}$ of Boolean [[truth value]]s. In particular, an ultrafilter _on_ a set $X$ is the same as an ultrafilter _in_ the Boolean algebra $P X$ (the power set). 

More generally, we can define an __ultrafilter__ in any [[partial order|poset]] to be a proper [[filter]] that is maximal among proper filters.  In a distributive [[lattice]], every ultrafilter is prime; the converse holds in a Boolean lattice.

Given an element $x$ of $S$, the __principal__ (or __fixed__) __ultrafilter__ (on $S$) at $x$ consists of every subset of $S$ to which $x$ belongs.  In contrast, if $F$ is an ultrafilter on $S$ such that the intersection of the elements of $F$ is [[empty set|empty]], then we call $F$ a __free ultrafilter__.  It is possible, if one denies the [[axiom of choice]], that every ultrafilter of subsets is principal.  In contrast, the [[ultrafilter theorem]] (a weak consequence of the axiom of choice) states that any proper filter (in a Boolean lattice) may be extended to a maximal filter.

Free ultrafilters are important in [[nonstandard analysis]] and [[model theory]], where the ultrafilter theorem seems to be a necessity.


## Category-theoretic interpretations 

There are in fact many interrelated ways of defining ultrafilters. 

### Unbiased Boolean algebras

We may start by redefining the notion of Boolean algebra as follows. 

In the ordinary scheme of things, a Boolean algebra is a set equipped with Boolean algebra operations; this gives rise to a monadic functor 

$$U: Bool \to Set$$ 

and the Lawvere theory may be described as the category opposite to the category of finitely generated free Boolean algebras (or of finitely generated free Boolean rings, if one prefers). The free Boolean ring on $n$ elements may be constructed, a la Beck distributive laws, as the monoid algebra $\mathbb{Z}_2[M_n]$ where $M_n$ is the free commutative idempotent monoid on $n$ elements. As a Boolean algebra, this is $P(2^n)$, the power set of a $2^n$-element set. By a "baby" form of Stone duality, the category of finitely generated free Boolean algebras is equivalent to the category of finite sets of cardinality $2^n$. Hence the Lawvere theory is identified with the category $Fin_{2^n}$ of finite sets of cardinality $2^n$, and the category of Boolean algebras is equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors 

$$Fin_{2^n} \to Set.$$ 

However, the [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of $Fin_{2^n}$ is $Fin_+$, the category of _nonempty_ finite sets. The category of Boolean algebras is then seen to be equivalent to the category of product-preserving functors 

$$Fin_+ \to Set$$

We call a product-preserving functor $Fin_+ \to Set$ an **unbiased Boolean algebra**. The idea here is that the usual way of viewing Boolean algebras is inherently biased towards sets of cardinality $2^n$. Passing to the Cauchy completion removes that bias. 

### Unbiased approach to ultrafilters

If $X$ is any set, there is a product-preserving functor 

$$Set(X, i-): Fin_+ \to Set$$ 

where $i: Fin_+ \to Set$ is the inclusion functor. Denote this by $-^X$. The inclusion functor $i$ is identified with $-^1$.

######Definition 2
An _ultrafilter on_ $X$ is a natural transformation $-^X \to -^1$ in the category $Prod(Fin_+, Set)$.

### Ultrafilters via codensity

We could just as well regard an ultrafilter as such a natural transformation living in the category $Set^{Fin_+}$ of _all_ functors $Fin_+ \to Set$. The ultrafilter monad is thereby obtained as a composite 

$$Set \to (Set^{Fin_+})^{op} \to Set$$ 

where the first functor sends a set $X$ to $Set(X, i-)^{op}$, and the second sends a functor $F: Fin_+ \to Set$ contravariantly to $Set^{Fin_+}(F, i)$. As mentioned by Tom Leinster in a post to the categories list, this monad is the **codensity monad** associated with the inclusion functor $i: Fin_+ \to Set$. 

(This identification of the ultrafilter monad with a codensity monad is given as exercise 3.2.12(e) in Algebraic Theories by Manes.) 

### Universal descriptions of the ultrafilter monad 

The following results are due to Reinhard B&ouml;rger (or at least the second is -- to be continued): 

* The ultrafilter monad is the terminal monad on $Set$ that restricts to the identity monad on the category of finite sets $Fin$. 

* The ultrafilter monad is the terminal monad on $Set$ that preserves finite coproducts. 

### Alternative "biased" descriptions 

To be continued. 

(This is [[Todd Trimble]]'s [description](http://dialinf.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/ultraproducts-the-category-theoretic-way/) of [[Lawvere]]'s idea.) 

Let $3$ denote a $3$-element set, say $\{0, 1, 2\}$. Let $M = hom(3, 3)$ be the $27$-element monoid consisting of functions from $3$ to $3$, with composition of functions playing the role of monoid multiplication. Then for any set $X$, $M$ acts naturally on $hom(X, 3)$, abbreviated here to $3^X$. Thus $3^X$ lives in the category $M$-Set. The set $3 = 3^1$ in particular carries a structure of $M$-set.

So, the map $X \mapsto 3^X$ defines a functor $Set \to (M-Set)^{op}$. This functor is left adjoint to a functor $(M-Set)^{op} \to Set$ which sends an $M$-set $Y$ to $hom_M(Y, 3)$, the set of functions $Y \to 3$ which respect the $M$-actions. Then, it turns out that the set of ultrafilters on $X$ can be naturally identified with the set $hom_M(3^X, 3)$, and the principal ultrafilter map

$$
X \to hom_M(3^X, 3)
$$

is again the unit of the adjunction. [The object $3$ plays a dual role, both as set and as $M$-set, and the adjunction we speak of here is based on this ambimorphicity of $3$. This is parallel to the ambimorphic nature of $2$ seen as set or as Boolean algebra.]

One can play a similar game, replacing $3$ by any set $A$, replacing $hom(3, 3)$, by $hom(A, A)$, etc. The monad of the adjunction would then be $hom_{A^A} (A^X, A)$. If $A$ is finite and greater than $2$, this monad is again the ultrafilter monad.

Lawvere seemed to be interested in formulating "large cardinal hypotheses" in terms of obstructions to nice duality statements for these and similar monads, where "nice" would mean here that the unit

$$
X \to hom_{A^A} (A^X, A)
$$

is an isomorphism. Again, if $A \gt 2$ is finite, and assuming the axiom of choice, this niceness is obstructed by the existence of infinite sets $X$. But if we take $A$ to be larger, let us say the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$, the existence of obstructions to this niceness then becomes tantamount to the existence of measurable cardinals. Lawvere cites one or two more examples of this phenomenon, of a more topological nature. 


## The ultrafilter monad

For any set $X$, let $U X$ be the set of ultrafilters on $X$.  Principal ultrafilters provide an inclusion $\eta\colon X\to U X$, which turns out to be the unit of a [[monad]] on $Set$.  The multiplication can be described fairly explicitly.  First of all, if $A\subseteq X$, define $[A]\subseteq U X$ to be the set of all ultrafilters containing $A$.  Then $\mathcal{F} \in U U X$, i.e. an ultrafilter of ultrafilters, we let $\mu(\mathcal{F}) = \{ A | [A] \in \mathcal{F} \}$; one can verify that this is an ultrafilter and makes $U$ into a monad. This monad is traditionally denoted $\beta$. 

A theorem due to Ernest Manes is that the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of this monad is the category of [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] with its obvious forgetful functor to $Set$. 

* In one direction, if $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, then the corresponding algebra structure 
$$\xi: \beta X \to X$$ 
sends an ultrafilter $F$ on $X$ to the unique point in $X$ to which $F$ converges. ($F$ **converges to** $x$ if the filter of neighborhoods of $x$ is contained in $F$.) 

* In the other direction, given an algebra structure $\xi: \beta X \to X$, we define a topology by defining a set $U \subseteq X$ to be open if 
$$\forall_{x \in X} \forall_{F \in \beta X} U \in F and \xi(F) = x \Rightarrow x \in U$$ 
The sense of this is that a set is open if it is a neighborhood of each of its points, and the neighborhood filter of $x$ is the intersection of all ultrafilters that converge to $x$. (The unit condition is that 
$$\xi (prin(x)) = x$$ 
so that the neighborhood filter of $x$ is contained in $prin(x)$, i.e., each neighborhood of $x$ contains $x$.) It is not hard to verify that this condition indeed defines a topology. In fact, the topology is compact Hausdorff, essentially because compactness is equivalent to having every ultrafilter converge to some point, and Hausdorffness to that point being unique. 

In particular, $\beta X$ can be equipped with a compact Hausdorff topology which is the free compact Hausdorff space generated by $X$, or equivalently the [[Stone-ÄŒech compactification]] of the [[discrete topology]] on $X$.

The monad $\beta$ also extends to the [[bicategory]] $Rel$ of sets and binary [[relations]].  It was observed by Barr that the [[generalized multicategories]] defined relative to this extension can be identified with arbitrary [[topological spaces]]; see [[relational beta-module]].  Thus, compact Hausdorff spaces are to topological spaces as monoidal categories are to multicategories. 

By exploiting the connection between monads and [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]], it is possible to define a **compact Hausdorff object** in any category $C$ with small products, as a product-preserving functor 

$$Kl(\beta)^{op} \to C$$ 

where $Kl(\beta)$ is the Kleisli category (or the full category of compact Hausdorff spaces whose objects are of the form $\beta S$).
