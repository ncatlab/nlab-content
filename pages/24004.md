## Idea

The [[solutions]] to [[linear equations]] and [[linear differential equations]] may be [[linear combination|linearly combined]] to produce further solutions. Such linear combinations, in particular the [[sums]] of two solutions, is also called *superposition* of solutions, in particular if it concerns solutions to [[wave equations]].


## Examples

### Classical waves

If two [[waves]] are described by a [[linear map|linear]] [[wave equation]], then the superposition of the two waves exist and the [[amplitude]] of the superposition of the two waves is the [[sum]] of the amplitudes of the two waves. 

### Quantum states

In [[quantum physics]], [[quantum states]] in the form of [[wavefunctions]] are solutions to [[linear differential equations]] such as the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]], [[Dirac equation]], [[Klein-Gordon equation]], [[Tomonaga-Schwinger equation]], etc. Their superposition is also known as *[[quantum superposition]]*, a concept that is at the heart of peculiar features of quantum physics, notably in the context of [[entanglement]].
