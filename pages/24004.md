## Idea

temporarily copied from Wikipedia

The superposition principle, also known as superposition property, states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. 

## Examples

If two waves are described by a [[linear map|linear]] [[wave equation]], then the superposition of the two waves exist and the amplitude of the superposition of the two waves is the sum of the amplitudes of the two waves.
