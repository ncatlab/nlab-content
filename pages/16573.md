## Scope

Mathematical economics studies mathematical methods and models which are applicable or otherwise directly relevant in economics. 

Applications of mathematics to economics are a wide field mainly out of scope of $n$Lab;
the parts of mathematics applied typically involved are also those of minor presence in $n$Lab (numerical analysis and simulation, optimization, [[control theory]], [[stochastic process]]es, regression analysis, time-series analysis,
integral and [[differential equation]]s, [[game theory]], complex networks, 
fixed point theory, [[statistics]]) or moderate presence ([[variational calculus]], [[dynamical system]]s) in $n$Lab.
 
We shall however include pointers in some cases which are relevant to
the $n$Lab, for example (nontrivial) connections to [[category theory]].
