## Idea

In [[particle physics]] [[experiments]], there tends to be a dichotomy between _direct detection at high energy_ and _indirect detection via high precision_.

Traditionally, direct high energy experiments have been dominating the field since the discovery of [[heavy quark|heavy]] [[quarks]] in large accelerator experiments, culminating in the discovery of the [[Higgs boson]] at the [[LHC experiment]]. Here the particle being detected is an actual decay product of the [[scattering]] process.

But heavy [[fundamental particles]], whose mass may be beyond that of direct reaction products obtained in a given accelerator experiment, may still manifest themselves indirectly, as [[virtual particles]] contributing to [[loop order|loop corrections]] of the [[scattering amplitudes]] of all lighter particles to which they couple. Therefore, sufficiently _precise_ measurement of light particle decays at low energy may still reveal the presence and properties of virtual particles at (much) higher energy.

{#IntensityFrontier} Discerning the small statistical effects expected in precision experiments requires access to a large amount of experimental data, hence to a high *intensity* of particle scattering processes, whence the community refers to precision experiments as probing "the intensity frontier" of particle physics (see the references [below](#IntensityFrontierReferences)). This is in contrast to direct detection experiment which can do with less data as long as it concerns high energy scattering processes, whence direct detection experiments are said to be probing "the energy frontier" of particle physics.

An example for a potential effect seen in precision experiments are the [[flavour anomalies]] in [[B-meson]] decays at various experiments, including the [[LHCb experiment]], [[Belle experiment]] and [[BaBar experiment]]. 

Since, at the same time, the [[LHC experiment]] has not made any further _direct_ detection, beyond the [[Higgs boson]], it has been argued that indirect precision experiments will or should gain in importance in the future of [[particle physics]].
