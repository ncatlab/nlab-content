[[!redirects ring of functions]]

###### Definition

Recall that the affine line $O_k=M_k(k[t],-)$ is an [[affine scheme|affine]] $k$-scheme. Let $M_k$ denote the category of $k$-rings.

A [[k-ring of functions on a k-functor|function on a]] $k$-scheme $X$ is defined to be an object $f\in O(X):=co Psh (M_k)(X,O_k)$. $O(X)$ is a $k$-ring by component-wise addition and -multiplication.

###### Proposition

There is an adjoint equivalence

$$(Sp\dashv O):Sch_{aff}\stackrel{O}{\to}Ring_k$$

of the categories of [[affine scheme|affine k-schemes]] and $k$-rings.
