## Idea

_Quantum computation_ is [[computation]] in terms of [[quantum information theory]], possibly implemented on _quantum computers_, hence on [[physical systems]] for which phenomena of [[quantum mechanics]] are not negligible.

Specifically, _topological quantum computation_ is (or is meant to be) quantum computation implemented on [[physical systems]] governed by [[topological quantum field theory]], such as [[Chern-Simons theory]]. A prominent example of this is the (fractional) [[quantum Hall effect]] in [[solid state physics]].

## Programing languages

* A [[functional programming language]] for quantum computing is _[[Quipper]]_.
