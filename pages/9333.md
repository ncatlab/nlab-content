## Idea

This page is to list example of how [[higher differential geometry]] helps to understand plain [[differential geometry]].

1. [[orbifold]] theory is all about [[etale Lie groupoid]] theory, for orbifolds/orbispaces are equivalently ([[proper Lie groupoid]]) [[etale Lie groupoids]]. 

   (this relation is for some reason more famous in algebraic geometry, where orbifolds are identified with [[Deligne-Mumford stacks]])

1. [[foliation]]-theory is all about [[Lie groupoid]]-theory via the "universal foliation", the  [[Haefliger groupoid]] .

1. [[partial differential equations]] are usefully encoded in [[exterior differential systems]], as noticed by Cartan. These are the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] of [[L-infinity algebroids]]

1. [[Lie integration]] of anything more general than a finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] in general goes out of the real of [[Lie groups]]. Local brackets = [[Lie algebroids]] integrate to [[Lie groupoids]] and 
[[infinite-dimensional Lie algebras]] in general to [[Lie 2-groups]].

1. [[derived differential geometry]] allows to resolve many otherwise singular limit/intersection constructions. Modern [[variational calculus]] in terms of [[jet bundle]] ("[[D-geometry]]") is formulated this way, as is [[symplectic reduction]] and the unification of both in the [[BV-BRST formalism]].
