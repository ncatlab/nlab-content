In plain groupoid theory ([[homotopy theory]]) smallness is usually the default meaning of "groupoid". But if one thinks of groupoids as special cases of [[categegories]], and since for categories the default definition allows a proper class of objects, while otherwise one explicitly speaks of a _[[small category]]_, it does make sense to speak of "small groupoids" at times.
