## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $X$ is an open [[manifold]], then there is a [[bijection]] between

1. [[codimension]] 1 [[foliations]] on $X$ up to integral [[homotopy]];

1. [[homotopy classes]] of fiberwise surjective [[vector bundle]] maps $T X \to N \Gamma_q$,

where $\Gamma_q$ is the [[topological groupoid]] of [[germs]] of local [[diffeomorphisms]] of $\mathbb{R}^q$.
