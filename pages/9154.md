## Definition

For $V$ a [[vector space]] and $r$ a [[cardinal number]] (generally taken to be a [[natural number]]), the **Grassmannian** $Gr(r,V)$ is the space of all linear [[subspaces]] of $V$ of [[dimension]] $r$.

Special cases:
* For $r = 0$, this is the [[point]].
* For $r = 1$, this is the [[projective space]] of $V$.
* For $r = \dim V$, this is the point again.
* For $r \gt \dim V$, this is the [[empty space]].

If $V$ is an [[inner product space]], then the [[orthogonal complement]] defines an [[isomorphism]] between $Gr(r,V)$ and $Gr(\dim V - r,V)$.
