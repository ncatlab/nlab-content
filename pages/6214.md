## Idea

The standard [[second law of theormodynamics]] states that in a closed system of [[classical mechanics]] or [[quantum mechanics]] the (coarse-grained) [[entropy]] is non-decreasing with time.

This is statement is to be tacitly understood as applying to dynamics taking place on an a-priori fixed [[spacetime]] (a fixed "background"). If however one takes also [[gravity]] into account as part of the "system", then the statement of the second law becomes much more subtle. 

The _generalized second law of theoremodynamics_ is an attempt to generalize the naive second law to [[general relativity]]. A central idea is that the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of [[horizon]]s (such as of [[black hole]]s) has to be added to the naive entropy of the matter in the "universe".

The first paper critiques previous work.  The second proves the generalized 2nd law in a semiclassical framework on a background spacetime that has both boost and null translation symmetries.  The argument makes heavy use of the concept of relative entropy.  The third paper generalizes the second one to a much wider class of spacetimes, assuming some axioms about the behavior of quantum fields on these spacetimes.
