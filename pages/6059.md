## Idea

_Twisted differential K-theory_ is supposed to be the [[twisted cohomology]] version of the [[differential cohomology]] called [[K-theory]]: the combination of [[differential K-theory]] and [[twisted K-theory]].

It is clear which basic properties one wants to demand of such a structure: it should be an extension of [[twisted de Rham cohomology]] by [[twisted K-theory]] via the [[twisted Chern character]] map.
