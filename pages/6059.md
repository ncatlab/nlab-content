## Idea

_Twisted differential K-theory_ is the [[twisted differential cohomology]] version [[K-theory]]: the combination of [[differential K-theory]] and [[twisted K-theory]].

Roughly this is an extension of [[twisted de Rham cohomology]] by [[twisted K-theory]] via the [[twisted Chern character]] map.

To the extent that [[D-brane charge]] is classified by [[K-theory]] (see [there](D-brane#ReferencesKTheoryDescription)), it is [[twisted differential K-theory]] that is relevant: the [[differential K-theory|differential]] aspect captures the [[higher gauge field]] called the [[RR-field]], and the [[twisted K-theory|twisted]] aspects captures the [[higher gauge field]] called the [[B-field]], in [[string theory]].

This example of [[D-brane charge]] used to be one of the main motivations for finding a definition and construction of twisted differential cohomology theories. Earlier articles on D-brane charge had to assume that such a theory exists (e.g. [DFM 09](twisted+differential+K-theory#DFM09)). Actual models now exist ([Grady-Sati 19a](#GradySati19a), [Grady-Sati 19b](#GradySati19b))
