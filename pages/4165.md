A __family of sets__ consists of an __index set__ $I$ and, for each element $k$ of $I$, a [[set]] $S_k$.

Given $I$, a set $F$ and a [[function]] $p\colon F \to I$, we get a family of sets by defining $S_k$ to be the [[preimage]] $p^*(k)$.

Conversely, given a family of sets, let $I$ be the [[disjoint union]]
$$ \biguplus_k S_k = \{ (k,x) | k \in I, x \in S_k \} $$
and let $f(k,x)$ be $k$.

(We should talk about ways to formalise this concept in various forms of [[set theory]] and when the latter construction above requires the [[axiom of collection]].)
