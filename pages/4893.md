## The general abstract principle

In [[higher category theory]] it is easy to verify that a (strict) $1$-[[transfor]]mation $\lambda$ between [[n-functor]]s $F_1,F_2 : C \to D$ between [[strict n-categories]] $C$ and $D$

$$
  \lambda : F_1 \Rightarrow F_2
$$

is determined uniquely by an $(n-1)$-functor

$$
  \eta : C_{(n-1)} \to D^{\Delta^1}
$$

on the strict $(n-1)$-category obtained from $C$ by discarding the [[n-morphism]]s.  (Of course, not every such $(n-1)$-functor determines such a transformation; the missing condition is "naturality" at the top level.)

Analogous statements hold for general (weak) [[n-categories]], although they are more complicated to formulate; see below.

As with various other easy facts about [[category theory]], these become interesting statements when realized in a concrete context where certain structures are modeled by $n$-[[functor categories]] for all $n$. 


### Examples in low dimension

We spell out explicitly the $(n-1)$-functorial nature of transformation for low values of $n$.

* **$(n=1)$** -- A [[natural transformation]] $\eta$ between [[functor]]s $F_1,F_2 : C \to D$ between ordinary [[categories]] consists of components which are given by a [[function]]

  $$
    \eta : Obj(C) \to Mor(D)
  $$

  that sends [[object]]s of $C$ to [[morphism]]s in $D$

  $$
    \eta : x \mapsto ( F_1(x) \stackrel{\eta(x)}{\to}  F_2(x))
    \,.
  $$

  Saying that such a function extends to a functor $C \to Arr(D)$:

  $$
    \eta : 
    \left(
      \array{
        x 
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_1}}
        \\
        y
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_2}}
        \\
        z
      }
    \right)
    \;\;\;
    \mapsto
    \;\;\;
    \left(
      \array{
        F_1(x) &\stackrel{\eta(x)}{\to}& F_2(x)
        \\
        {}^{\mathllap{F_1(f)}}\downarrow
         &=& 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_2(f)}}
        \\
        F_1(y) &\stackrel{\eta(y)}{\to}& F_2(y)
        \\
        {}^{\mathllap{F_1(g)}}\downarrow
          &=& 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_2(g)}}
        \\
        F_1(z) &\underset{\eta(z)}{\to}& F_2(z)
      }
    \right)
    \,.    
  $$

  is equivalent to saying that these components form a natural transformation.  Since there are no nontrivial [[2-morphism]]s in $D$---in other words, the forgetful functor $Arr(D) \to D\times D$ is faithful---such an extension to a functor is necessarily unique.

  So we may regard the component function of $\eta$ as a [[0-functor]]

  $$
    \eta : \mathbf{sk}_0 C = Obj(C) \to D^{\Delta[1]} = Arr(D)
  $$

  from the [[discrete category]] on the set of objects of $C$ to the [[arrow category]] of $D$.

* **$(n=2)$** A [[pseudonatural transformation]] $\eta$ between (strict, say, for ease of of notation) [[2-functor]]s $F_1,F_2 : C \to D$ between ([[strict 2-category|strict]], for simplicity) [[2-categories]] is in components a 1-[[functor]] that functorially assigns pseudonaturality squares:

  $$
    \eta : 
    \left(
      \array{
        x 
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_1}}
        \\
        y
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_2}}
        \\
        z
      }
    \right)
    \;\;\;
    \mapsto
    \;\;\;
    \left(
      \array{
        F_1(x) &\stackrel{\eta(x)}{\to}& F_2(x)
        \\
        {}^{\mathllap{F_1(f)}}\downarrow
         &\swArrow_{\eta(f)}& 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_2(f)}}
        \\
        F_1(y) &\stackrel{\eta(y)}{\to}& F_2(y)
        \\
        {}^{\mathllap{F_1(g)}}\downarrow
          &\swArrow_{\eta(g)}&
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_2(g)}}
        \\
        F_1(z) &\underset{\eta(z)}{\to}& F_2(z)
       }
    \right)    
  $$

  We may regard this as a 1-functor

  $$
    \eta : \mathbf{sk}_1 C \to Arr(D)
  $$

  from the underlying 1-category of $C$ to the arrow category of $D$, whose objects are morphisms in $D$, whose morphisms are squares in $D$, and whose composition is [[pasting]] of such squares (see [[double category]] for details).

  Again, saying that this 1-functor extends to a 2-functor from $C$ to the arrow 2-category of $D$ says precisely that these components form a pseudonatural transformation, and any such extension is unique when it exists since the forgetful 2-functor $Arr(D)\to D\times D$ is locally faithful.



* **$(n=3)$** -- A transformation between 3-functors is in components a  [[2-functor]] that sends [[2-morphism]]s in $C$ to cyclinders in $D$. This is shown in the $(n=3)$-row of the following diagram

  <img width = "550" src="http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schreiber/pics/koh.gif" alt="components of transformations" />


  The pseudonaturality condition on $\eta$, which is componentwise the equation

  <img width = "550" src="http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schreiber/pics/natthree.gif" alt="2-pseudonaturality" />

  and the fact that there are only identity 3-morphisms in $D$ implies that this already uniquely extends to a 2-functor

  $$  
    \eta : C \to Arr(D)
    \,,
  $$

  where on the right we have the 2-category whose objects are morphisms in $D$, whose morphisms are squares in $D$ and whose 2-morphisms are cylinders bounded by these squares.

### Formalizations {#Formalizations}


For [[strict ∞-categories]] modeled as globular [[strict ω-categories]] we have the following simple statement of the general principle.

+-- {: .un_Lemma}
###### Observation

For $C,D \in Str n Cat$ and $F_1, F_2 : C \to D$ two strict $n$-functors, [[transfor]]mations $\eta : F_1 \Rightarrow F_2$ which are in components given by $n$-functors

$$
  \eta : C \to D^{G_1}
$$

are entirely specified by their underlying $(n-1)$-functors

$$
  \eta : C_{n-1} \to D^{G_1}
  \,.
$$

=--

For weak $n$-categories analogous statements hold, but may have a less straightforward formulation. What is always true is that the transformation $\eta$ is specified by its values on $(n-1)$-morphisms (and below) and will be functorial in a weak sense on these, but these $(n-1)$-morphisms and below will usually not form an $(n-1)$-category themselves, since they will compose coherently only up to $n$-morphisms.

One way to bring the general case into the above simple form is to invoke models by [[semi-strict ∞-categories]]. By [[Simpson's conjecture]], every [[∞-category]] has a model in which everything is strict except possibly the [[identities]] and their unitalness [[coherence law]]s. This means that if $C$ is such a semistrict model of an $n$-category, then $C_{n-1}$ is an $(n-1)$-[[semicategory]] and the transformation

$$
  \eta : C_{n-1} \to D^{\Delta[1]}
$$

is an $n$-functor on that. (By naturalness we have that $\eta$ is guaranteed also to respect the weak identities in $C$ in some way, but that way is not so easy to formalize.)

More generally, for any algebraic notion of weak $n$-category, there is a corresponding algebraic "$(n-1)$-dimensional" structure containing only the operations on $(n-1)$-dimensional cells and below in the given notion of weak $n$-category.  This is not in general a notion of weak $(n-1)$-category, but it may suffice to formulate the above principle precisely.  If the starting notion of $n$-category had strict associativity and interchange, then the resulting $(n-1)$-dimensional structure will be a notion of $(n-1)$-semicategory.


## Application in functorial QFT
 {#ApplicationsInQFT}

For instance in [[FQFT]] one models $n$-dimensional [[topological quantum field theories]] as [[(∞,n)-functor]]s on a flavor of an [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]]

$$
  Z : Bord_{n}^S \to \mathcal{C}
$$

(where the superscript $S$ is to remind us that this may be [[cobordism]]s equipped with some extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]]).

It follows that with $Z_1, Z_2$ two such $n$-dimensional QFTs, a transformation $B : Z_1 \Rightarrow Z_2$ does look in components itself like an QFT -- which is _twisted_ by $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ in some sense (see [below]()) -- , but in dimension $(n-1)$.

More specifically, if $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] with tensor unit $1$ there is the trivial FQFT $\mathbf{1}$ given by the constant $(\infty,n)$-functor $\mathbf{1} : Bord_n \to \mathcal{C}$.

One can see in examples that the transformations

$$
  B : Z \Rightarrow \mathbf{1}
$$

encode _boundary conditions_ on cobordisms with boundary for the theory $Z$. Conversely, this means that one discovers on the boundary of the $n$-dimensional QFT $Z$ the $(n-1)$-dimensional QFT $B$. Or rather, this is the case if instead of [[natural transformation]]s $\eta$ one uses [[canonical transformation]]s: those component maps $\eta : C_{n-1} \to D^{I}$ that are required to be natural only with respect to the invertible $(n-1)$-morphisms in $C$.

For the case of $n=2$ and 2-dimensional cobordisms without any extra structure, a detailed version of these statements are given in ([Schommer-Pries](#SchommerPries)). For $n=3$ and the holographic relation between [[Reshetikhin–Turaev model]] and rational 2d [[CFT]] in [[FFRS-formalism]] some remarks are in ([Schreiber](#Schreiber)).

In the study of [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]] such kinds of relations between $n$-dimensional QFTs and $(n-1)$-dimensional QFTs on their boundary have been called the _[[holographic principle]]_ . The degree to which this principle has been formalized and the degree to which this formalization has been verified varies greatly. Examples include

* The boundary theory of 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] is the 2-dimensional [[WZW-model]]. 

  This is probably the oldest known holographic relation between QFTs.

* In the 2-d QFT called the [[Poisson sigma-model]] with target the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] coming from a [[Poisson manifold]] the boundary 3-point function computes the [[deformation quantization]] of the classical system described by that Poisson manifold. 

  (This was in fact used implicitly by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] to solve deformation quantization. The relation to the Poisson sigma-model was made explicit by Cattaneo and Felder.)

* The boundary theory of the 2-dimensional [[A-model]] QFT on a target space that is a complexification of a classical [[phase space]] is the 1-dimensional QFT (= [[quantum mechanics]]) that is the [[geometric quantization]] of this phase space. 

  This is described at [[quantization via the A-model]]. 

* The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjectures specifically a holographic relation between [[quantum gravity]] on a 10-dimensional asymptotically [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] and a superconformal [[Yang-Mills theory]] on its asymptotic boundary. More generally, this specific construction is supposed to apply, with variations, in many different dimensions.
