
Given a [[set]] $S$ and a [[cardinal number]] $\kappa$, the 
$\kappa$th __cartesian power__ $S^\kappa$ of $S$ is the $\kappa$-fold [[cartesian product]] of $S$ with itself.

In particular, the $S^2$ is the [[cartesian square]] of $S$, the set of [[ordered pairs]] of elements of $S$; and $S^{\aleph_0}$ is the set of [[infinite sequences]] of elements of $S$.

The concept generalises from [[Set]] to any [[category]] $C$ with all [[products]]; $S$ becomes an [[object]] of $C$, but $\kappa$ remains a cardinal number (still essentially an object of $Set$).

If we think of $\kappa$ as a full-fledged [[set]] in its own right (rather than just its cardinal number), then we are talking about a _[[function set]]_, and the generalisation is to [[cartesian closed categories]].
