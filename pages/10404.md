## Definition

There are two different meanings of _horizontal differential form_

Given a [[bundle]] $\pi \colon P \to X$ of [[smooth manifolds]], 

* then a [[differential form]] on the total space $P$ is _horizontal_ if it vanishes on [[vertical vector fields]]:

* in the context of [[variational calculus]]: 

  a differential form on the the total space $J^\infty_X(E)$ of the [[jet bundle]] of $E$ is horizontal if it is in the horizontal compoent of the [[variational bicomplex]] of $J^\infty(E)$.
