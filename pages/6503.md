## Idea

The term _principal connection_ is synonymous to _[[connection on a bundle|connection]] on a [[principal bundle]]_ . 

The most well known examples are [[affine connection]]s. 

Given a $G$-[[representation]] $V$ and a $G$-principal connection, it induces a connection on the corresponding $V$-[[associated bundle]].
