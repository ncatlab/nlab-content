[[!redirects Les Derivateurs]]
_Les Dérivateurs_ is a manuscript of some 2000 pages left behind by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] when he disappeared in 1991, dealing with the fundamentals of [[homotopy theory]]. It can be considered as a sequel to the more famous [[Pursuing Stacks]], but has a less conversational style.
