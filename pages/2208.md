
Given a family of [[structures]] of the same signature in the sense of [[model theory]] (or more specially, [[universal algebra]]), one can (assuming the [[ultrafilter principle]], a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]) use [[ultrafilters]] to form a certain [[congruence]] on the [[direct product]] and construct a [[quotient object]], a new structure of the same signature, called an __ultraproduct__. An ultraproduct of some number of copies of the same structure may be called an __ultrapower__.

The [[hyperreal number]]s ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_numbers)) and nonstandard integers in [[nonstandard analysis]] are obtained as [[denumerable set|countable]] ultrapowers with help of [[free ultrafilters]] on $\mathbb{N}$. Such ultrafilters contain all [[cofinite subset|cofinite]] subsets of integers, but not only them. See [wikipedia:ultraproduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraproduct).

>Unlike [[limits]] and [[colimits]], an ultraproduct is not defined by any [[universal mapping property]]. Of course, if the category has limits and ([[filtered colimit|filtered]]) colimits, then it has ultraproducts constructed as colimits of [[products]] ... But usually the category of models of a [[coherent theory]] (such as the theory of [[discrete field|fields]]) lacks products and  hence does not have categorical ultraproducts.
