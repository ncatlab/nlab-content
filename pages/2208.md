## Idea 

An ultraproduct is a set-theoretic construction, used especially in [[model theory]], to produce a new structure from an infinite family of structures. It is used especially to witness the [[compactness theorem]]: suppose one is given a set of formulas $S$ in some first-order language and a family of structures such that any finite subset of formulas is modeled by some member of the family. Then an ultraproduct of those structures may be used to model the entire set $S$. 

In slightly greater detail, given a family of [[structures]] of the same signature in the sense of [[model theory]] (or more specially, [[universal algebra]]), one can (assuming the [[ultrafilter principle]], a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]) use [[ultrafilters]] to form a certain [[congruence]] on the [[direct product]] and construct a [[quotient object]], a new structure of the same signature, called an __ultraproduct__. An ultraproduct of some number of copies of the same structure may be called an __ultrapower__.

## Definition 

First we present the bare-bones set-theoretic construction; then we discuss structures and models.

###### Definition 
Let $X$ be a set, and let $U$ be an [[ultrafilter]] on $X$, which may be regarded as an element $U: 1 \to \beta X$ of the [[Stone-Cech compactification]] $\beta X = \hom_{Bool}(2^X, 2)$ with its usual topology. The **ultrapower functor** over $U$ is the functor 

$$Set/X \simeq Sh(X_{disc}) \stackrel{i_\ast}{\to} Sh(\beta X) \stackrel{U^\ast}{\to} Set$$ 

where $i_\ast$ is the [[direct image functor]] between categories of [[sheaves]] induced from the [[inclusion map|inclusion]] $i: X \to \beta X$ of $X$ as a [[discrete space|discrete]] [[subspace]], and the [[inverse image functor]] $U^\ast$ is also known as the "taking the [[stalk]]" functor at the point $U \in \beta X$.

Let us extract a more concrete description. Let $\{Y_x: x \in X\}$ be an $X$-indexed family of sets, which we can view as an object $Y \to X$ of $\Set/X$. We may view this object as a sheaf over $X$ as discrete space; as a presheaf, it takes an open set (an arbitrary subset $A \subseteq X$) to the set of sections over $A$ which is $\prod_{x \in A} Y_x$. The direct image functor $i_\ast$ takes this presheaf to the presheaf which sends an arbitrary open set $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \beta X$ to $\prod_{x \in X \cap \mathcal{V}} Y_x$, and then the stalk functor $U^\ast$ sends this to the [[filtered colimit]] 

$$colim_{\mathcal{V} \ni U} \prod_{x \in X \cap \mathcal{V}} Y_x$$ 

and since the basic opens $\mathcal{V}_A = \{U' \in \beta X: A \in U'\}$ with $A \in U$ are [[cofinal functor|cofinal]] in the system of open neighborhoods of $U$ (ordered by reverse inclusion), the colimit may be written more simply as 

$$colim_{A \in U} \prod_{x \in A} Y_x$$ 

and this is the *ultraproduct*, often written as $\prod_{x \in X} Y_x/U$. When all the fibers $Y_x$ are the same set $Z$, this is written as $Z^X/U$ and called an *ultrapower* of $Z$. 

Now suppose each $Y_x$ carries a structure specified by a [[signature (in logic)|signature]]; in other words, for each function symbol $f$ and predicate symbol $R$ there are specified operations and subsets 

$$\omega_f: Y_x^{ar(f)} \to Y_x, \qquad \rho_R \rightarrowtail Y_x^{ar(R)}$$ 

where $ar$ denotes arity (constants being considered function symbols of arity zero). Then of course the products $\prod_{a \in A} Y_x$ carry structures canonically induced from those on the $Y_x$. As all of the function symbols $f$ and predicate symbols $R$ have finite arity, and since the taking of filtered colimits commutes with finite limits in $Set$, we get a canonically induced structure on the ultraproduct $\prod_{x \in X} Y_x/U$. More briefly: since $U^\ast i_\ast$ preserves finite limits, it takes finitary structures $Y_x$ in $Set/X$ to a finitary structure of the same type in $Set$. 

## Examples 

The [[hyperreal number]]s ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_numbers)) and nonstandard integers in [[nonstandard analysis]] are obtained as [[denumerable set|countable]] ultrapowers with help of [[free ultrafilters]] on $\mathbb{N}$. Such ultrafilters contain all [[cofinite subset|cofinite]] subsets of integers, but not only them. See [wikipedia:ultraproduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraproduct).

>Unlike [[limits]] and [[colimits]], an ultraproduct is not defined by any [[universal mapping property]]. Of course, if the category has limits and ([[filtered colimit|filtered]]) colimits, then it has ultraproducts constructed as colimits of [[products]] ... But usually the category of models of a [[coherent theory]] (such as the theory of [[discrete field|fields]]) lacks products and  hence does not have categorical ultraproducts.
