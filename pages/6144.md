## Definition

If $X$ is a [[locally compact group|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], a __Radon measure__ on $X$ is a [[Borel measure]] on $X$ that is 

* finite on all [[compact subsets]],

* outer regular (i.e. can be approximated from outside by measure on the [[open sets]]) on all [[Borel sets]], and

* inner regular (i.e. can be approximated from inside by a measure on compact sets) on [[open subset|open sets]]. 


## Properties

If a Radon measure is $\sigma$-finite then it is regular (i.e. both inner and outer regular) on all Borel subsets. Left (right) [[Haar measure]] on a [[locally compact topological group]] is a nonzero Radon measure which is invariant under left (right) multiplications by elements in the group.
