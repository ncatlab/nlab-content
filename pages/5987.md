
## Idea

In [[physics]] [[Noether's theorem]] relates [[symmetries]] to [[conserved currents]] and [[charges]].   Give a [[symmetry]] [[Lie algebra]] or [[Lie group]], and given a [[central extension]] of this, then the generators of the central extension are accordinly called _central charges_.

## Examples

* [[Virasoro Lie algebra]]

* [[extended supersymmetry]]

[[!redirects central charges]]
