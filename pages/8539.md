## Idea

Most of the time, a [[proposition]] $\phi$ is a _contradiction_ if assuming it there is a [[proof]] of [[false]], hence if the [[hypothetical judgement]]

$$
 \phi \vdash \bot
$$

is valid.

In [[paraconsistent logic]], however, one sometimes reserves the term "contradiction" for the situation when both a proposition and its negation hold.  This is often a contradiction in the above sense, but not always.

A system of [[formal logic]] that proves a contradiction is called [[inconsistency|inconsistent]].
