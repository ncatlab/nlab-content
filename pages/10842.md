The homotopy theory of simplicial profinite spaces has been explored by [[Fabien Morel]] and [[Gereon Quick]]. 

For Morel's theory see

* [[F. Morel]], _Ensembles profinis simpliciaux et interprétation géométrique du foncteur $T$_, Bull. Soc. Math. France, 124, (1996), 347–373, 



A reference to Quick's work is in 

 
* [[G. Quick]], _Profinite homotopy theory_, [pdf](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/documenta/vol-13/17.pdf)

but there was an error in the proof of one of the main results which has been corrected in 

* [[G. Quick]],  _Continuous group actions on profinite spaces_, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 215 (2011),
1024-1039.
