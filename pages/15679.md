## Idea

At certain [[integers]] $s = n$ the values $L(s)$ of  [[L-functions]] $L$ are typically of special interest, these are known as the "special values of L-functions".

For instance some of special values of the [[Riemann zeta function]] found (for the non-trivial region of non-positive integers) by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1734 and 1749 are

| n | -5 | -3 | -1 |  0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| $\zeta(n)$ | $-\frac{1}{252}$ |  $\frac{1}{120}$ | $-\frac{1}{12}$ | $-\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ | $\frac{\pi^4}{90}$ | $\frac{\pi^6}{945}$ | $\frac{\pi^8}{9450}$

where notably the value $\zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12}$ turns out to be the [Euler characteristic of the moduli stack of complex elliptic curves](moduli+stack+of+elliptic+curves#EulerCharacteristic) and as such controls much of [[string theory]] (notably the critical dimension).

### Periods and Deligne's conjecture

More generally, it is known that for $K$ a [[number field]] and $\zeta_K$ its [[Dedekind zeta function]], then all values $\zeta_K(n)$ for integer $n$ happen to be [[periods]] ([MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/54244/381)).

Based on this ([Deligne 79](#Deligne79)) identified _critical values_ of $L$-functions (at certain integers) and [[conjecture|conjectured]] that these all are algebraic multiples of [[determinants]] of [[matrices]] whose entries are [[periods]]. Review of this relation to periods in in ([Konsevich Zagier, section 3](#KonsevichZagier)).

Notice that under the [[function field analogy]] these arithmetic $L$-functions are supposed to be analogous to [[eta functions]] and [[zeta functions of elliptic differential operators]], which, when regarding these operators as [[Dirac operators]]/[[Hamiltonians]] encode [[partition functions]] and [[path integrals]] of [[quantum mechanical systems]], and that [[periods]] naturally appear as [[expectation values]] in [[quantum field theory]] (highlighted in [Kontsevich 99](deformation%20quantization#Kontsevich99)).


### Regulators and Beilinson's conjectures

Another kind of special value is given by the classical [[class number formula]] which says that the [[residue]] of the [[Dedekind zeta function]] $\zeta_K$ of a [[number field]] $K$ at $n = 1$ is proportional to the [[regulator of a number field|regulator of the number field]].

Also the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] expresses the first non-vanishing [[derivative]] of the $L$-series of an [[elliptic curve]] over $\mathbb{Q}$ at $s= 1$ in terms of the [[regulator of a number field|regulator]].

Motivated by this ([Beilinson 85](#Beilinson85)) generalized both Deligne's conjecture and the statements about regulators by defining [[higher regulators]] ("Beilinson regulators") and conjecturing a general statement that expresses special values of $L$-function in terms of these, now known as _[[Beilinson's conjectures]]_.

### Periods and Scholl's conjecture

However ([Scholl 91](#Scholl91)) observed that also these [[Beilinson regulators]] have an expression in terms of [[periods]] and ([Konsevich Zagier, section 3.2 and 3.5](#KonsevichZagier)) advertises the 

**Deligne-Beilinson-Scholl conjecture**: _For $r$ the order of vanishing of a motivic $L$-function at some integer $n$, then the $r$th [[derivative]] of the function at that point is a [[period]]._
