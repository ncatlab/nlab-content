## Idea

There are several theorems of [[Ernest Michael]] from 1950s about [[paracompactness]]. There is also Michael's 1972 characterization of paracompact [[locally compact spaces]] under certain class of quotient maps.  

## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
**(Michael theorem on the closed image of a paracompact)**

The [[image]] of a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] under a [[closed maps|closed]] [[continuous function]] is also paracompact Hausdorff.

###### Proposition
**(Michael selection theorem)** 

A lower semicontinuous map from a paracompact topological space $X$ to a [[Banach space]] $E$ with convex closed values has a continuous subrelation which is a function. If this is true for a given topological space $Y$ instead of $E$ and all such functions and codomains $E$, then $Y$ is paracompact.
