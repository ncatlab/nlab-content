## Idea

### General

_Perturbation theory_ is a general method of finding (or even defining) the solution of equations of mathematical physics by expanding them with respect to a small parameter in the vicinity of known, defined or well-understood solution (for which the small parameter is $0$). It is used in the study of PDEs involving operators depending on small parameter, in classical and celestical mechanics, in quantum mechanics, and in the statistical and [[perturbative quantum field theory]]. 

One of the varieties of perturbation theory provides a method to make sense of and handle the [[path integral]] involved in the [[quantization]] of [[classical field theory]] to [[quantum field theory]].

It is based on the observation that the [[quantization]] of free [[classical field theory|classical field theories]], whose [[action functional]] contains only the kinetic term, is well understood; therefore, the quantization of a functional consisting of a kinetic term and polynomial interaction terms may be expanded like a [[Taylor series]] in the interaction terms, thus yielding what looks like a series of [[correlator]]s in a free field theory.  If the **coupling constant** -- the parameter in front of the interaction terms -- is small enough, one says one is in the _weakly coupled regime_ of the theory and expects this perturbation series to approximate the desired answer. Usually, even for that to work the [[action functional]] first has to be subjected to [[renormalization]].

### More details

Suppose we're working with a quantum system that's nearly a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], but not quite; that is, the quadratic potential $V_0 = \frac{1}{2}k x^2 - \frac{1}{2}$ is only a good local approximation to the real potential $V_0 + \lambda V$.  Then we can write the [[Hamiltonian]] as $H = H_0 + \lambda V,$ where $V$ is a function of the [[position]] $x$ and the [[momentum]] $p$ (or equivalently, of $z = \frac{p+i x}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\frac{d}{dz}$) and $\lambda$ is small.

Now we solve Schrödinger's equation perturbatively.  We know that
\[\psi(t) = e^{-itH} \psi(0),\]
and we assume that
\[e^{-itH}\psi(t) \approx e^{-itH_0} \psi(t)\]
so that it makes sense to solve it perturbatively.  Define
\[\psi_1(t) = e^{itH_0} e^{-itH}\psi(t)\]
and
\[V_1(t) = e^{itH_0} \lambda V e^{-itH_0}.\]
After a little work, we find that
\[\frac{d}{dt}\psi_1(t) = -i V_1(t) \psi_1(t),\]
and integrating, we get
\[\psi_1(t) = -i\int_0^t V_1(t_0) \psi_1(t_0) dt_0 + \psi(0).\]
We feed this equation back into itself recursively to get
\[\array{ \psi_1(t) & = & -i \int_0^t V_1(t_0) \left[-i\int_0^{t_0} V_1(t_1) \psi_1(t_1) dt_1 + \psi(0) \right] dt_0 + \psi(0) \\ & = & \left[\psi(0)\right] + \left[\int_0^t i^{-1} V_1(t_0)\psi(0) dt_0\right] + \left[\int_0^t\int_0^{t_0} i^{-2} V_1(t_0)V_1(t_1) \psi_1(t_1) dt_1 dt_0\right] \\ & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{t \ge t_0 \ge \ldots \ge t_{n-1} \ge 0} i^{-n} V_1(t_0)\cdots V_1(t_{n-1}) \psi(0) dt_{n-1}\cdots dt_0 \\ & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-\lambda i)^n \int_{t \ge t_0 \ge \ldots \ge t_{n-1} \ge 0} e^{-i(t-t_0)H_0} V e^{-i(t_0-t_1)H_0} V \cdots V e^{-i(t_{n-1}-0)H_0} \psi(0) dt_{n-1}\cdots dt_0. }\]
So here we have a sum of a bunch of terms; the $n$th term involves $n$ interactions with the potential interspersed with evolving freely between the interactions, and we integrate over all possible times at which those interactions could occur.

Here's an example [[Feynman diagram]] for this simple system, representing the fourth term in the sum above:
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://reperiendi.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/3.gif" alt="Three interactions with the perturbation." title="3" width="10" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-798" /></p>
The lines represent evolving under the free Hamiltonian $H_0$, while the dots are interactions with the potential $V$.

As an example, let's consider $V = (z + \frac{d}{dz})$ and choose $\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ so that $\lambda V = p.$  When $V$ acts on a state $\psi = z^n,$ we get $V \psi = z^{n+1} + nz^{n-1}.$  So at each interaction, the system either gains a photon or changes phase and loses a photon.

## Properties

### Divergence/Convergence
 {#DivergenceConvergence}

Despite what one might naively expect, the [[perturbation series]] of natural [[quantum field theories]] have a vanishing [[radius of convergence]], they are [[asymptotic series]]. 

Roughly this can be understood as follows: since the pertrubation is in the [[coupling constant]] about vanishing coupling, a non-zero [[radius of convergence]] would imply that the theory is finite also for _negative_ coupling (where "things fly apart"), which will not happen in realistic theories. 

More in detail, [[theory (physics)|theories]] with [[non-perturbative effects]] such as [[instantons]] [[field (physics)|field]] configurations (such as [[Yang-Mills theory]], hence [[QCD]], [[QED]]), [[branes]] (such as [[string theory]]), etc., are expected to have a  [[path integral]] which as a [[function]] of the [[coupling constant]] $g$ schematically looks like

$$
  Z(g)
  = 
  \sum_n a_n g^n
  + 
  e^{-A/g}
  \sum_n a_n^{(1)} g^n
  + 
  \mathcal{O}(e^{-2A/g})
  \,,
$$

where the first sum is the [[perturbation series]] itself and where the terms with a prefactor of the form $\exp(-A/g)$ are the contributions of the [[instantons]] ($A$ is the contribution of the [[instanton]] [[action functional]]). Since all the [[derivatives]] of the function $g \mapsto e^{-1/g}$ vanish at [[coupling constant]] $g = 0$, the [[Taylor series]] of this part of the path integral does not appear in [[perturbation series]], even though it is present. Therefore this is called a _[[non-perturbative effect]]_.

See the [references below](#ReferencesDivergenceConvergence) for details. The mathematics behind this is called _[[resurgence theory]]_.
