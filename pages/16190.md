## Idea
Recent work in domain theory has shown direct connections between operations in [[type theory]] and [[general topology]]. Martin Escardo has given the following translations between the two fields;

| general topology | type theory |
|--|--|
| [[topological space|space]] | type |
| [[continuous function]] | [[computable function]]
| [[clopen set]] | decidable set |
| [[open set]] | semi-decidable set |
| [[closed set]] | set with semi-decidable complement |
| [[discrete space]] | type with decidable equality |
| [[Hausdorff space]] | type with semi-decidable inequality |
| [[compact set]] | exhaustively searchable set, in a finite number of steps |

This may hint at an extension to [[computational trinitarianism]].

## Implementation

Many of the results that have originated from this view have been implemented in an [[Agda]] [library](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/agda/)
