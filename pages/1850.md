In [[electromagnetism]] the [[electromagnetic field]] is modeled by a degree 2 [[differential cohomology|differential cocycle]] $\hat F \in H(X, \mathbb{Z}(2)_D^\infty)$ (see [[Deligne cohomology]]) with curvature characteristic 2-form $F \in \Omega^2(X)$.

With $\star$ denoting the [[Hodge star operator]] with respect to the corresponding pseudo-Riemannian metric on $X$, the right hand of

$$
  d \star F = j_{el}
$$

models the **electric current** on $X$. IF $X$ is globally hyperbolic and $\Sigma \subset X$ is any spacelike hyperslice, then

$$
  Q_{el} := \int_\Sigma j_{el}
$$

is the **electric charge**  encoded by this configuration of the [[electromagnetic field]].

Notice that due to the above equation $d j_{el} = 0$, so that $Q$ is independent of the choice of $\Sigma$. This models the physical phenomenon of _charge conservation_ .

# Remarks #

While electric current is modeled by just a differential form, magnetic charge has a more subtle model. See
