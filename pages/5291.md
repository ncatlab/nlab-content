###### Definition

A **Poisson algebra** is

* a [[module]] $A$ over some [[ring]],

* equipped with the structure $\cdot : A \otimes_k A \to A$ of an [[associative algebra]];

* and equipped with the structure $[-,-] : A \otimes_k A \to A$ of a [[Lie algebra]];

* such that for every $a \in A$ we have that $[a,-] : A \to A$ is a [[derivation]] of $\cdot$.
