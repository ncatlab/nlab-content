This entry is about the article

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Deformation theory_ ([arXiv:0709.3091](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3091))

on the notions of [[deformation theory]] -- such as [[Kähler differentials]] and [[cotangent complex]]es -- generalized from the ordinary context of [[algebra]] to that of [[higher algebra]]. In particular it studies the case where ordinary [[rings]] are replaced by $E_\infty$-[[E-∞-ring|rings]].

Much of this has meanwhile be absorbed in section 8.3 of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Higher Algebra]]_
