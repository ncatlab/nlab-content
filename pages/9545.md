## Idea

By [[Gelfand duality]], suitable [[topological spaces]] are [[contravariant functor|contravariantly]] [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to [[commutative algebra|C*-algebras]]. Therefore conversely, non-commutative $C^\ast$-algebras may be thought as the formal [[duality|duals]] of generalized topological spaces, "noncommutative topological spaces". Therefore the study of [[operator algebra]] and [[C-star-algebra]] theory is sometimes called _noncommutative topology_. This is a special case of the general idea of [[noncommutative geometry]].

(Not to be confused with _[[algebraic topology]]_, which is instead the study of ordinary [[topology]] and of its [[homotopy theory]] by [[algebra|algebraic]] tools.)
