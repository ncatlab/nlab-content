## Idea

The _Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem_ gives a formula that computes the [[Euler characteristic]] of an even-[[dimension]]al [[smooth manifold]] as the [[integration]] of a [[curvature characteristic form]] of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on its [[tangent bundle]].

For [[surface]]s the theorem simplifies and in this simpler version is the older _Gauss-Bonnet theorem_ .

## Statement

###### Theorem

Let $X$ be a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] of even [[dimension]] $dim X = 2k$. Write $\chi(X)$ for its [[Euler characteristic]].

For $\nabla$ any [[Levi-Civita connection]] on its [[tangent bundle]], write $F_\nabla$ for its [[curvature]] [[differential form|2-form]], valued in the [[orthogonal Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}(2k)$ and $Pf(F_\nabla)$ for its [[Pfaffian]] $2k$-form.

Then 

$$
  \chi(X) = 
  \left(
    \frac{-1}{2 \pi}
  \right)^{k}
  \int_X Pf(F_\nabla)
  \,.
$$

### For orbifolds

There is a generalization for $X$ an [[orbifold]] due to ([Satake](#Satake)).
