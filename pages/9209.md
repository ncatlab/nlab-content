## Idea

The natural [[tensor product]] operation on [[abelian categories]] is known as the _Deligne tensor product_ or _Deligne box product_, introduced in ([Deligne 90](#Deligne)).

For $A$ and $B$ two suitable [[abelian category|abelian categories]], their Deligne tensor product $A \boxtimes B$ is the abelian category such that suitably [[exact functors]] $A \boxtimes B \to C$ are equivalent to functors $A \times B \to C$ that are suitably exact in each argument.

## Properties

### In terms of categories of modules and tensor product of algebras

Let $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}$ be two [[finite abelian categories]] over $k$.

###### Remark

We recall that for every finite abelian category over $k$, there is a finite-dimensional $k$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] $A$ and a $k$-linear [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  \mathcal{C} \simeq A Mod_{fd}
  \,
$$

where the right side consists of $A$-modules which are finite-dimensional as vector spaces over $k$. We remark that $A$ is determined only up to [[Morita equivalence]].

###### Proposition

For $A, B \in Alg_R$ two [[associative algebras]], the Deligne tensor product of [[categories of modules]] is given by the [[tensor product of algebras]]

$$
  (A Mod)  
  \boxtimes
  (B Mod)
  \simeq
  (A \otimes_R B) Mod
  \,.
$$

This appears for instance as ([EGNO, prop. 1.46.2](#EGNO)).
