## Idea

### For pointed sets

The __wedge sum__ $A \vee B$ of two [[pointed set]]s $A$ and $B$ is the [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $A \uplus B$ where both copies of the basepoint (the one in $A$ and the one in $B$) are identified.  The wedge sum $A \vee B$ can be identified with a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $A \times B$; if this subset is collapsed to a point, then the result is the [[smash product]] $A \wedge B$.

### For general pointed objects

The wedge sum can be defined for [[pointed object]]s in any category $C$ with [[pushouts]], and is the [[coproduct]] in the category of pointed objects in $C$.  A very commonly used case is when $C=$[[Top]] is a category of [[topological spaces]].  The wedge sum also makes sense for any family of pointed objects, not just for two of them.

###### Definition

For $\{x_i \colon * \to X_i\}_i$ a set of [[pointed objects]] in a [[category]] with [[colimits]], their _wedge sum_ $\vee_i X_i$ is the [[pushout]]

$$
  \vee_i X_i \coloneqq (\coprod_i X_i) \coprod_{\coprod_{i} *} *
$$

in 

$$
  \array{
     \coprod_{i} * &\stackrel{(x_i)}{\to}& \coprod_i X_i
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     * &\to& \vee_i X_i
  }
$$

## Examples

* A wedge sum of pointed [[circles]] is also called a **bouquet** of circles. See for instance at _[[Nielsen-Schreier theorem]]_.

* For $X$ a [[CW complex]] with [[filtered topological space]] structure $X_0 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow \X_k \hookrightarrow X_{k+1} \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X$ the quotient topological spaces $X_{k+1}/X_k$ are wedge sums of $(k+1)$-spheres.
