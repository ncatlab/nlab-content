### For pointed sets

The __wedge sum__ $A \vee B$ of two [[pointed set]]s $A$ and $B$ is the [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $A \uplus B$ where both copies of the basepoint (the one in $A$ and the one in $B$) are identified.  The wedge sum $A \vee B$ can be identified with a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $A \times B$; if this subset is collapsed to a point, then the result is the [[smash product]] $A \wedge B$.

### For general pointed objects

The wedge sum can be defined for [[pointed object]]s in any category $C$ with [[pushout]]s, and is the [[coproduct]] in the category of pointed objects in $C$.  A very commonly used case is when $C=$[[Top]] is a category of [[topological space]]s.  The wedge sum also makes sense for any family of pointed objects, not just for two of them.
