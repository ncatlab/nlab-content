The __wedge sum__ $A \vee B$ of two [[pointed set]]s $A$ and $B$ is the [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $A \uplus B$ where both copies of the basepoint (the one in $A$ and the one in $B$) are identified.

The wedge sum $A \vee B$ can be identified with a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $A \times B$; if this is collapsed to a point, then the result is the [[smash product]] $A \wedge B$.

The wedge is the [[coproduct]] in the category of pointed sets.  All of this makes sense for any family of pointed spaces, not only for two spaces $A$ and $B$.
