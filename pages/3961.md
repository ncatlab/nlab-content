You can look at **[its source code](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/source/Template+page)** to see how the various parts are done. A minimal template is given first which can be copy-and-pasted into newly created pages.  See [[HowTo]] for more details.

## Idea

It is an old observation that xyz. One notices that from the [[nPOV]] this is just an abc. This leads to the definition of a uvw. It is useful for doing klm and provides the basis for the more general theory of &#228;&#246;&#252;.


## Abstract

A uvw is effectively a uv together with a w. Its main property is encoded in Somebody's Theorem which says that it consists of precisely three letters. The archetypical example of a uvw is $\mu \nu \omega$; details will be explained in the [special examples paragraph](/nlab/show/template+page#Specific_examples).


## Definition

As Jacques Distler said,

> See [more about definition/theorem/proof-environments](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/wiki/instiki/show/Theorems).


\begin{definition}\label{uvwDef}
**(uvw)** \linebreak

A **uvw** is a UVW in which all letters are lower case.

\end{definition}


This may be summed up in the slogan:

+-- {: .standout}

A uvw is just what it looks like.

=--


## Properties

\begin{lemma}

Every uvw (Def. \ref{uvwDef}) contains at least one letter.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By inspection.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
Every uvw contains strictly more than one letter.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Use the above lemma and continue counting:

\[
  1 + 1 = 2  \label{firstequation}
  \,.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Every uvw (Def. \ref{uvwDef}) contains exactly three letters.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Along the lines of the above proposition, we use equation \eqref{firstequation} and then conclude with

$$
  2 + 1 = 3
  \,.
$$

Notice that this is indeed independent of in which order we sum up the letters, in that the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}
    &
      \overset{Id \times + }{\longrightarrow} 
    &
    \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{+ \times Id}}
    \big\downarrow 
    && 
    \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{+}}
    \\
    \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}
    &
      \underset{+}{\longrightarrow}
    &
    \mathbb{N}
  }
  \,.
$$


\end{proof}

+-- {: .num_corollary}
###### Corollary

No uvw contains more than three letters.

## Examples

### Special cases

*  First case

*  Second case

*  Third case



+-- {: .query}
_[[Urs Schreiber|First person]]_:  I listed all of the special cases that I know above, but didn\'t Grothendieck study an important version too?

_[[Toby Bartels|Second person]]_:  No, you\'re thinking of Lawvere.  When I find the reference, I\'ll put it here.

### Specific examples
{#Specific_examples}

For ease of reference, we will number the examples.

\begin{example}\label{FirstExample}
The first example is obvious.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{SecondExample}
The second example is a slight variation of Exp. \ref{FirstExample}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ThirdExample}
The third example is completely different from both Exp. \ref{SecondExample}.
\end{example}
