## Idea

A first simple definition in the framework of [[general relativity]] is this: A _relativistic particle with zero rest mass_ is a lightlike curve in a [[spacetime]]. A _relativistic particle with nonzero rest mass_ is a timelike curve in a [[spacetime]]. For the definition of lightlike and timelike curves see [[smooth Lorentzian space]].

A more "full-fledged" definition is this:

The _relativistic particle_ propagating on a [[spacetime]] $(X,g)$ is the 1-[[dimension]]al [[sigma-model]] whose kinetic part of the [[action functional]] is the [[length]] functional, as given by the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] $g$ and whose gauge-coupling to an [[electromagnetic field]] on $X$ given by a [[line bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ on $X$ is the [[parallel transport]] of that connection:

$$
  \exp S : \gamma \mapsto \exp i S_{kin}(\gamma) \exp i S_\nabla(\gamma)
$$

where $S_{kin} = length_g(\gamma)$ and $\exp i S_\nabla(\gamma) = tra_\nabla(\gamma)$.
