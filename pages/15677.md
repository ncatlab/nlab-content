### Relation to the idele class group

A much larger variant of the ideal class group is the [[idele class group]]...

### Relation to the pole of the zeta function

The [[Dedekind zeta function]] $\zeta_K$ of the [[number field]] $K$ has a [[simple pole]] at $s = 1$. The _[[class number formula]]_ says that its [[residue]] there is proportional the the product of the [[regulator of a number field|regulator]] with the [[class number]] of $K$

$$
  \underset{s\to 1}{\lim} (s-1) \zeta_K(s)
  \propto
  ClassNumber_K \cdot Regulator_K
  \,.
$$
