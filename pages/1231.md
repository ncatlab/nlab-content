__Koszul duality__ is a duality and phenomenon generalizing the duality between the symmetric and exterior algebra of a vector space to so-called quadratic [[differential graded algebra]]s (which can be obtained as a free dga module an ideal of relations which live in degree 2). For a pair of Koszul dual algebras, there is a correspondence between certain parts of their derived categories (precise formulation involves some finiteness conditions). In a setup in which one of the algebras is replaced by a cocomplete dg coalgebra, there is a formulation free of finiteness conditions, but involving [[twisting cochain]] (see that entry).

#Informal discussion

First, it's important to understand there are a lot of algebras whose derived categories are equivalent in surprising ways.  [[Morita equivalences]] are kind of boring, especially for finite dimensional algebras; essentially the only thing you can do is change the dimensions of objects.

The way you see this is that if A-mod and B-mod are equivalent, then the image of A as a module over itself is a projective generator of B-mod, and for a finite-dimensional algebra, essentially the only thing you can do is take several copies of the indecomposible projectives of B.

On the other hand, if you take the derived category of [[differential graded module|dg-modules]] over A (the dg part of this is not a huge deal; it's just that they're very close to, but a bit better behaved than actual derived/[[triangulated categories]] which I consider something of a historical mistake, which should be replaced with dg/A-infinity versions), this is equivalent to the category of dg-modules over the [[endomorphism algebra]] (this is in the dg sense, so it's a dg-algebra whose cohomology is the Ext algebra) of *any* generating object.  There are a *lot* more generating objects than projective generators, so there are a lot of derived equivalences.

In particular, you can take your favorite finite dimensional algebra A, and the most obvious not-very-projective generating object: the sum of all the [[simple modules]].  Call this L.
As I mentioned, there's an equivalence $A-dg-mod = \mathrm{Ext}(L,L)-dg-mod$, just given by taking $\mathrm{Ext}(L,-)$.   

Now, in general, $\mathrm{Ext}(L,L)$ is an absolutely horrible object (for example, for [[group algebras]] over [[finite fields]] some time, it can be quite complicated), but sometimes it turns out to be nice.  For example, if you start with A being the [[exterior algebra]], you'll get a [[polynomial ring]] on the dual vector space.  Another (closely related) example is that the cohomology of a [[reductive group]] (over C) is Koszul dual to the cohomology of its classifying space.

One thing that could help you make sure that $\mathrm{Ext}(L,L)$ is nice is if your algebra is graded.  Then $\mathrm{Ext}(L,L)$ inherits an "internal" grading in addition to its homological one.  If these coincide, then $A$ is called _Koszul_. 

In this case, $B=\mathrm{Ext}(L,L)$ is forced to be formal (if it had any interesting A-infinity operations, they would break the grading), so you're dealing with a derived equivalence between actual algebras, though you have to be a bit careful about the dg-issues.  You've found that the derived category of usual modules over A is equivalent to dg-modules over B (with its unique grading) and vice versa.  You can fix this by taking graded modules on both sides.

#Examples

* The most famous example of Koszul dual algebras is the exterior algebra $\wedge^{\bullet}V[-1]$ and the polynomial algebra $\mathram{Sym}^\bullet V^*[-2]$.
* A regular block of [[category O]] for any [[semi-simple Lie algebra]] is a self-Koszul dual.
:* More generally, a singular block of [[parabolic category O]] is dual to a different singular block of parabolic category O where the combinatorial data determining the central character and finiteness conditions switch.
* Braden, Licata, Proudfoot and Webster gave a combinatorial construction of a large family of Koszul dual algebras in [Gale duality and Koszul duality](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0806.3256).
