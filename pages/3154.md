There are at least two Alexander Rosenberg's: 

* an (older) algebraist Alex or Alexander Rosenberg known from Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg's theorem and many other articles in [[algebra]] 

* Alexander L. Rosenberg (or Sasha Rosenberg) currently a professor at [Kansas State University](http://www.math.ksu.edu).  

Sasha Rosenberg had defended in 1973 dissertation at Moscow State University studying Tannakian reconstruction theorems, mainly using methods of functional analysis. His main goals were in representation theory. Until leaving Soviet Union around 1987, Rosenberg worked in applied mathematics; on the side however he was developing some methods in representation theory which included functional analysis and categorical and ring/module theoretic methods, and the noncommutative localization in particular. A main construction, presented at a conference at Baikal (1981), was a new spectrum of a ring, so-called left spectrum, later generalized to a spectrum of an abelian category, used to prove (in the  quasicompact case) the Gabriel-Rosenberg reconstruction theorem for commutative schemes. This work outgrown into a wide ongoing work on foundations of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], including a natural definition of [[noncommutative scheme]]. His coauthors in pure mathematics works are Valery Lunts and [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. One should be warned that most of newly released articles of Rosenberg are not at the arXiv but at the Max Planck Bonn [preprint server](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Research/MPIM+Preprint+Series).
