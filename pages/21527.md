## Idea

_Proper $G$-equivariant homotopy theory_ ([DHLPS 19](#DHLPS19)) is the variant of $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]] where the [[topological group]] $G$ is allowed to be non-[[compact topological group|compact]] (for instance a non-[[finite group|finite]] [[discrete group]]) but whose [[weak equivalences]] are still detected only on [[fixed point spaces]] of [[compact topological group|compact]] [[subgroups]] of $G$.

Hence in the presentation by [[topological G-spaces]], proper $G$-equivariant homotopy theory is obtained by [[simplicial localization|localizing]] at those [[equivariant function|equivariant]] [[continuous functions]] $f \;\colon\; X \to Y$ which induce [[weak homotopy equivalences]] $f^H \;\colon\; X^H \to Y^H$ for all compact subgroups $H \subset G$ ([DHLPS 19, Def. 1.1.2](#DHLPS19)).

Equivalently, under [[Elmendorf's theorem]] ([DHLPS 19, p. 87](#DHLPS19)) this is the [[homotopy theory]] of [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] on the [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the $G$-[[orbit category]] on those orbits corresponding to compact subgroups (e.g. finite subgroups for $G$ discrete, details in [DHLPS 19, Remark 3.1.12](#DHLPS19)).
