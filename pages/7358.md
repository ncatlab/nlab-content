## Idea

The concept of _$\Gamma$-spaces_ is a model for [[∞-groupoids]] equipped with a multiplication that is unital, associative, and commutative up to higher [[coherence|coherent]]  [[homotopies]]:  they are models for [[E-∞ spaces]] and hence, if grouplike ("very special" $\Gamma$-spaces), for [[infinite loop spaces]] / [[connective spectra]] / [[abelian ∞-groups]].

The notion of $\Gamma$-space is a close variant of that of [[Segal category]] for the case that the underlying [[(∞,1)-category]] happens to be an [[∞-groupoid]], happens to be [[n-connected object of an (∞,1)-category|connected]] and is equipped with extra structure.



$\Gamma$-spaces differ from [[operad|operadic]] models for $E_\infty$-spaces, such as in terms of  [[algebra over an operad|algebras]] over an [[E-∞ operad]], in that their multiplication is specified "[[geometric definition of higher categories|geometrically]]" rather than [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraically]].

## Definition

Let $\Gamma^{op}$ (see [[Segal's category]]) be the [[skeleton]] of the category of [[finite set|finite]] [[pointed sets]].  We write $\underline{n}$ for the finite pointed set with $n$ non-basepoint elements.  Then a **$\Gamma$-space** is a functor $X\colon \Gamma^{op}\to Top$ (or to [[simplicial sets]], or whatever other model one prefers).

We think of $X(\underline{1})$ as the "underlying space" of a $\Gamma$-space $X$, with $X(\underline{n})$ being a "model for the cartesian power $X^n$".  In order for this to be valid, and thus for $X$ to present an infinite loop space, a $\Gamma$-space must satisfy the further condition that all the [[Segal map]]s
$$ X(\underline{n}) \to X(\underline{1}) \times \dots \times X(\underline{1})$$
are [[weak equivalences]].  We include in this the $0$th Segal map $X(\underline{0}) \to *$, which therefore requires that $X(\underline{0})$ is contractible.  Sometimes the very definition of *$\Gamma$-space* includes this homotopical condition as well.

## Properties

### Relation to simplicial sets

We have a functor $\Delta\to\Gamma$, where $\Delta$ is the [[simplex category]], which takes $[n]$ to $\underline{n}$.  Thus, every $\Gamma$-space has an underlying simplicial space. This simplicial space is in fact a [[special Delta-space]] which exhibits the 1-fold delooping of the corresponding $\Gamma$-space.

### As classifying topos for pointed objects

The [[topos]] $\Set^{\Gamma^{op}}$ of $\Gamma$-sets is the [[classifying topos]] for [[pointed objects]] ([MO question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/85600/what-do-gamma-sets-classify)). For more on this see also at _[[classifying topos for the theory of objects]]_.

### Model category structure

A [[model category]] structure on $\Gamma$-spaces is due to ([Bousfield-Friedlander 77](#BousfieldFriedlander77)). See at _[[model structure for connective spectra]]_.
