Operator nabla assigns to a scalar field its density of current ([[gradient]]) $T\mapsto \nabla T$ by the integral formula (here valid on a Riemannian manifold)

$$
(\nabla T)(x) = lim_{vol D\to 0} \frac{1}{vol D} \oint_{\partial D} \vec{n} T d S,\,\,\,\,\stackrel{\circ}{D}\ni x,
$$

where $D$ runs over the domains with smooth boundary $\partial D$ containing point $x$ in its interior and $\vec{n}$ is the unit vector of outer normal to the surface $S$. The formula does not depend on the shape of boundaries taken in limiting process, so one can typically take a coordinate chart containing balls $D = D_r$ with decreasing radius $r\gt 0$ in this particular coordinate chart. 

Hamilton introduced this operator symbolically in coordiantes of $\mathbf{R}^n$ as
$$\nabla = \sum_{k = 1}^n e_k \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}.$$


It can be used to define the [[divergence]] and [[rotation of a vector field]]. 

## Historical and terminological notes 

Nabla is an old instrument in the shape of inverted triangle, sort of assyrian harp. Hamilton introduced the operator $\nabla$ (sometimes called Hamilton's or Hamiltonian operator, but distinguish strictly from [[Hamiltonian]] in the mechanics sense)
