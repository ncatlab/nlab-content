## Idea

Roughly, $Rel$ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[sets]] and whose [[morphisms]] are (binary) [[relations]] between sets. It becomes a [[2-category]] (in fact, a [[2-poset]]) by taking [[2-morphisms]] to be inclusions of relations. 


## Definition

$Rel$ is a [[2-poset]] (a [[enriched category|category enriched]] in the category of [[posets]]), whose [[objects]] or $0$-cells are [[sets]], whose [[morphisms]] or $1$-cells $X \to Y$ are [[relations]] $R \subseteq X \times Y$, and whose [[2-morphisms]] or  $2$-cells $R \to S$ are inclusions of relations. The _composite_ $S \circ R$ of morphisms $R: X \to Y$ and $S: Y \to Z$ is defined by the usual relational composite 
$$\{(x, z) \in X \times Z: \exists_{y \in Y} (x, y) \in R \wedge (y, z) \in S\} \hookrightarrow X \times Z$$ 
and the _identity_ $1_X: X \to X$ is the [[equality relation]], in other words the usual diagonal embedding 
$$\{(x, x): x \in X\} \hookrightarrow X \times X.$$ 

Another important operation on relations is _taking the opposite_: any relation $R: X \to Y$ induces a relation 
$$R^{op} = \{(y, x) \in Y \times X: (x, y) \in R\} \hookrightarrow Y \times X$$ 
and this operation obeys a number of obvious identities, such as $(S \circ R)^{op} = R^{op} \circ S^{op}$ and $1_X^{op} = 1_X$. 


## Relations and spans

It is useful to be aware of the connections between the [[bicategory of relations]] and the [[bicategory]] of [[span|spans]]. Recall that a _span_ from $X$ to $Y$ is a diagram of the form 
$$X \leftarrow S \to Y$$ 
and there is an obvious category whose objects are spans from $X$ to $Y$ and whose morphisms are morphisms between such diagrams. The terminal span from $X$ to $Y$ is 
$$X \stackrel{\pi_1}{\leftarrow} X \times Y \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} Y$$ 
and a relation from $X$ to $Y$ is just a [[subobject]] of the terminal span, in other words an isomorphism class of monos into the terminal span. 

To each span $S$ from $X$ to $Y$, there is a corresponding relation from $X$ to $Y$, defined by taking the [[image]] of the unique morphism of spans $S \to X \times Y$ between $X$ and $Y$. It may be checked that this yields a lax morphism of bicategories 
$$Span \to Rel$$ 


## Relations in a category

More generally, given any [[regular category]] $C$, one can form a 2-category of relations $Rel(C)$ in similar fashion. The objects of $Rel(C)$ are objects of $C$, the morphisms $r: c \to d$ in $Rel(C)$ are defined to be [[subobject|subobjects]] of the terminal span from $c$ to $d$, and 2-cells $r \to s$ are subobject inclusions. To form the composite of $r \subseteq c \times d$ and $s \subseteq d \times e$, one takes the [[image]] of the unique span morphism 
$$r \times_c s \to c \times e$$ 
in the category of spans from $c$ to $e$, thus giving a mono into the terminal span from $c$ to $e$. The subobject class of this mono defines the relation 
$$s \circ r \subseteq c \times e$$ 
and the axioms of a regular category ensure that $Rel(C)$ is a 2-category with desirable properties. Similar to what was said above, there is again a lax morphism of bicategories 
$$Span(C) \to Rel(C)$$

There is also a functor 
$$i: C \to Rel(C)$$ 
that takes a morphism $f: c \to d$ to the functional relation defined by $f$, i.e., the relation defined by the subobject class of the mono 
$$\langle 1, f\rangle: c \to c \times d$$

Such functional relations may also be characterized as precisely those 1-cells in $Rel(C)$ which are [[adjunction|left adjoints]]; the right adjoint of $\langle 1, f \rangle$ is the opposite relation $\langle f, 1\rangle$. The unit amounts to a condition 
$$1_c \subseteq \langle f, 1 \rangle \circ \langle 1, f \rangle$$ 
which says that the functional relation is _total_, and the counit amounts to a condition 
$$\langle 1, f \rangle \circ \langle f, 1 \rangle \subseteq 1_d$$ 
which says the functional relation is _well-defined_.
