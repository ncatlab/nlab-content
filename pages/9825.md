## Idea

Quantum measurement is [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. 


## Definition
 {#Definition}

In terms of [[mixed quantum states]] represented by [[density matrices]], a quantum measurement is a [[quantum operation]] which is given by a [[positive-operator valued measure]]

## The "measurement problem"

In the context of _[[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]_it is common to speak of the "measurement problem" when referring to the tension between regarding [[quantum physics]] as a [[probability theory|probabilistic]] theory and the idea of realism.

Namely by the [above](#Definition) a quantum measurement is formally reflected in a change of [[probabilities]]. But since in any given [[measurement]] [[experiment]] one definite outcome is observed, one may wonder how that particular outcome was actually chosen, given that the theory only gives its probability.

points out that for symmetric systems with a symmetric [[ground state]], already a tiny perturbation mixing the ground state with the first [[excited state]] causes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in a suitable limit, and suggests that this already resolves the measurement problem.
