
## Idea

[[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Due to traditional conceptual puzzlement also referred to as the _measurement problem_.

## Related concepts

* [[decoherence]]

points out that for symmetric systems with a symmetric ground state, already a tiny perturbation mixing the ground state with the first excited stated causes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in the suitable limit, and suggests that this already resolves the measurement problem.
