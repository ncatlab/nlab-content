# Quantum measurement

## Idea

Quantum measurement is [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Due to traditional conceptual puzzlement also referred to as the _measurement problem_.


## Related concepts

* [[decoherence]]

* [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]

## References

The article

* [[Klaas Landsman]], Robin Reuvers, _A Flea on Schrödinger's Cat_,  Found. Phys. 43, 373-407 (2013) ([arXiv:1210.2353](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2353), [pdf](http://www.math.ru.nl/~landsman/Catresubmission.pdf))

points out that for symmetric systems with a symmetric [[ground state]], already a tiny perturbation mixing the ground state with the first [[excited state]] causes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in a suitable limit, and suggests that this already resolves the measurement problem.
