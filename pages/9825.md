## Idea

Quantum measurement is [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Due to traditional conceptual puzzlement also referred to as the _measurement problem_.


## Related concepts

* [[decoherence]]

points out that for symmetric systems with a symmetric [[ground state]], already a tiny perturbation mixing the ground state with the first [[excited state]] causes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in a suitable limit, and suggests that this already resolves the measurement problem.
