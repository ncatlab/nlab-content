## Idea

Pasting schemes are one possibility to give a rigorous treatment of  the (older) notational device of [[pasting diagrams]]. 


## Variants of pasting schemes. 

More than one definition of *pasting scheme* has been used to give a justification to the practice of [[pasting diagrams]]. 

For example, there exist the *pasting schemes in the sense of  [Johnson 1987](#Johnson1987), and there are the *pasting schemes in the sense of [Power 1990](#Power1990).  

## Related concepts


* [[pasting diagram]]
