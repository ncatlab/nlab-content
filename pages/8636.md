## Idea

Pasting schemes are one possibility to give a rigorous treatment of  the (older) notational device of [[pasting diagrams]]. 


## Variants of pasting schemes. 

More than one definition of *pasting scheme* has been used to give a justification to the practice of [[pasting diagrams]]. 

For example, there exist the *pasting schemes in the sense of Johson*, introduced in ([Johnson 1987](#Johnson1987)), and there are the *pasting schemes in the sense of Power*, introduced in \cite(#Power1990).  

### Pasting schemes in the sense of Power 




A *pasting scheme in the sense of Power* consists of data

* a [[plane digraph|digraph]] $D=(V,A)$

* specified vertices $q_{-\infty}\in V$ and $q_\infty\in V$


subject to axioms (terminology from [[digraph]])

1. $q_{-\infty}$ and $q_\infty$ are [[denial inequality|not equal]]

1. $q_{-\infty}$ is an $\omega$-king of $D$ 

1. $q_{\infty}$ is an $\omega$-coking of $D$ 

1. for each facet $F\in\mathrm{Fa}(D)$ there exists vertices $a(F)\in V$ and $b(F)$ such that
