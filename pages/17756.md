### Structure of the seminar ###
{#Structure}

Each time we have a topical talk given by local or external speakers on (higher) differential geometry and (derived) algebraic geometry, based on interests of the participants. The abstracts can be seen in this webpage at least one week prior to the talk. We shall also give a minor amount of prerequisites for each talk, so that undergraduates who are not familiar with those can have some preview ahead of time. By the end of each talk, there will be a conclusion section consists of discussions, Q&A, backgrounds survey to help people with diverse backgrounds to better capture the main ideas.

### Prerequisite ###
{#Prerequisite}
Basics of calculus and algebras.

### Plan of Talks ###

#### Nov. 3rd, 2016: On jets, jet bundles and $l_\infty$ structures. ####

We start by looking at formal Taylor series of smooth functions at certain point of a smooth manifold $M$, and from this we define an infinite dimensional manifolds called jets space. We show that this space can be viewed as an infinite dimensional vector bundle over $M$, and describe the transition function. The infinite jet bundle $J_M$ has a filtration, and can be noncanonically identified with ${\rm Sym}^\bullet T^\vee M$. Moreover, there are algebraic structures on its sections $\Gamma(J_M)\equiv \mathcal J_M$.

* A helpful practice: consider the case when $M = \mathbb R^n$, then one can view $J_M$ as an infinite dimensional vector space. 

* We assume one knows the basic definition of vector bundles, and as special example, tangent bundle and cotangent bundle.

####Nov. 10th, 2016: Geometric and topological information of jet bundles, Atiyah class.####
