###### Theorem
**(Power)**
Any [[bicategory]] with finite [[2-limit|bilimits]] is [[equivalence of bicategories|equivalent]] to a [[strict 2-category]] with finite [[flexible limits]].
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $K$ be a bicategory with finite bilimits, let $K \hookrightarrow [K^{op},Cat]$ be its [[Yoneda embedding for bicategories|Yoneda embedding]], and let $K'$ be the closure of $K$ in $[K^{op},Cat]$ under finite flexible limits.  Since $Cat$ is a strict 2-category with finite flexible limits, so is $[K^{op},Cat]$.  And since $K$ has finite bilimits, and these are preserved by its Yoneda embedding, while flexible limits are in particular bilimits, every object of $K'$ is equivalent to an object of $K$.  Thus, $K\simeq K'$.
