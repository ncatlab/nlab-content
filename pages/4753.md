* table of contents
{: toc}

## Motivation

There are two broad definitions of [[category]] in the literature: one which immediately generalises to the usual definition of [[internal category]] and one which immediately generalises to the usual definition of [[enriched category]].

Here we consider the latter definition and show how it may naturally be expressed in [[dependent type theory]].  In a [[type theory]] where [[types]] are [[presets]] (without an inherent [[equality predicate]]), it is not manifestly possible to express so-called [[evil]] ideas in category theory.
