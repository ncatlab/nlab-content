While the composition of birational maps given by [[Laurent polynomial]]s is in general not a Laurent polynomial there is a number of systematic situations when this is true. In particular, in a [[cluster algebra]], any cluster variable is expressed in terms of any given cluster as a Laurent polynomial with coefficients in the integral group ring $\mathbf{Z}\mathbf{P}$ where $\mathbf{P}$ is the coefficient group. An explanation in the quantum case, from a Hodge-theoretic point of view, has recently being offered by A. Efimov.
