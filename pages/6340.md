## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of _index_ was originally defined

* _[For elliptic differential operators](#IdeaForDifferentialOperators)_

as an invariant correction of the [[kernel]] of such an operator. More generally the resulting notion is abstractly characterized as being the pairing operation ([[composition]])

* _[in KK-theory](#GeneralIdeaInKKTheory)_.

### For elliptic differential and Fredholm operators
 {#IdeaForDifferentialOperators}

The _[[analytical index]]_ of an [[elliptic operator|elliptic]] [[differential operator]] $D \colon \Gamma(E_1) \to \Gamma(E_2)$ is defined to be the the difference between the [[dimension]] of its [[kernel]] and that of its [[cokernel]]. 

One reason why this is an interesting invariant of an elliptic differential operator is that when deforming the operator by a [[compact operator]] then the dimension of both the kernel and the cokernel may change, but their difference remains the same. Hence one may think of the analytic index as a "corrected" version of its [[kernel]], such as to make it be more invariant. 

Another useful way to think of this index is to interpret $D$ as being the [[Dirac operator]] of a [[spinning particle]] or more generally the [[supercharge]] of a system in [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. Then the index is the [[partition function]] of this quantum mechanical system, namely the [[super-trace]] of the [[heat kernel]] of the corresponding [[Hamiltonian]] [[Laplace operator]] ([Berline-Getzler-Vergne 04](#BerlineGetzlerVergne04)).

On the other hand, the _[[topological index]]_ of an elliptic differential operator $D$, is defined to be the pairing of the [[cup product]] of its [[Chern character]] and the [[Todd class]] of the base manifold with its [[fundamental class]].

More generally such analytic and topological indices are defined for [[Fredholm operators]].

The _[[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]]_ assert that these two notios of index are in fact equal.

### General abstract definition in KK-theory
 {#GeneralIdeaInKKTheory}

The abstract [[universal property|universal]] characterization of indices is: the index is the _pairing_ in [[KK-theory]]/[[E-theory]].

More in detail, by the discussion there [[KK-theory]] ([[E-theory]]) is the [[category]] $KK$ which is the additive and split exact [[localization]] of the category [[C*Alg]] of [[C*-algebras]] at the [[compact operators]]. For $\mathbb{C}$ the base [[C*-algebra]] of [[complex numbers]] the [[morphisms]] in this category have the following equivalent meaning:

* [[morphisms]] $\mathbb{C} \to A$ are [[operator K-theory|operator K-cohomology]] classes which are represented by "[[vector bundles]] over the space represented by $A$", namely by [[Hilbert modules]] $E$ over $A$;

* [[morphisms]] $A \to \mathcal{C}$ are [[K-homology]] classes which are represented by [[Fredholm operators]] $D$;

* the [[composition]] 

  $$
    ind(D_E) 
      \;\colon\;
    \mathbb{C} \stackrel{E}{\to} A \stackrel{D}{\to} \mathbb{C}
    \;\;\;\;
    \in KK(\mathbb{C}, \mathbb{C}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  $$

  in the category $KK$ (hence the Kasparov product) is the _index_ of the Fredholm operator $D$ twisted by $E$.

More generally, if $B$ is some other chosen base [[C*-algebra]] then $KK(A,B)$ is the group of [[Fredholm operators]] $D$ on [[Hilbert module]] bundles over the [[C*-algebra]] $B$, and one takes the pairing

$$
  ind \coloneqq \circ_{\mathbb{C}, A, B} \;\colon\;
  KK(\mathbb{C},A) \times KK(A,B) \to KK(\mathbb{C}, B)
$$

to be the index map relative $B$. (See e.g. [Schick 05, section 6](#Schick05).) This is the case that the [[Mishchenko-Fomenko index theorem]] applies to.

And hence even more generally one may regard _any_ composition in $KK$ as as a generalized index map. Via the universal characterizatin of $KK$ itself, this then gives a fundamental and general abstract characterization of the notion of index:

_The index pairing is the [[composition]] operation in the [[KK-theory|KK-]][[localization of a category|localization]] of [[C*Alg]], hence in [[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]].
