## Definition

If X is a type of structure that can be defined in a [[category]], [[higher category]], or category with some sort of [[stuff, structure, property|structure]], then the **walking X** is an informal term for the *free category (resp. higher category, category with suitable structure) containing an X*.

More precisely, if $StructCat$ denotes some (higher) category of categories with an appropriate type of structure, then the **walking X** is an object $[X] \in StructCat$ together with a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[equivalence]]
$$ StructCat([X],C) \simeq \{Xs \; in \; C\}$$
between the hom-set/category/space from $[X]$ to $C$, for any $C\in StructCat$, and the set/category/space of all Xs in $C$.

## Examples

* The [[interval category]] is the *walking arrow*.

* The augmented/algebraist's [[simplex category]] is the *walking [[monoid]]* (in a [[monoidal category]]).

* The [[syntactic category]] of a [[theory]] $T$ in some [[doctrine]] $D$ is the "walking $T$-model" (in a $D$-category).  In particular, the [[classifying topos]] of a [[geometric theory]] $T$ is the "walking $T$-model" *qua* [[Grothendieck topos]] (where the morphisms are the left-adjoint parts of [[geometric morphisms]]).
