## Idea

Despite its fundamental role in the [[standard model of particle physics]], various details of the [[quantization]] of the class of [[field theories]] known as [[Yang-Mills theory]] are still open, such as derivations of the phenomena 

* [[quark]] [[confinement]]

and notably

* the _mass gap problem_, the question of why the [[bound states]] of massless [[quarks]] ([[hadrons]]) have [[mass]]
