## Idea

Despite its fundamental role in the [[standard model of particle physics]], various details of the [[quantization]] of the class of [[field theories]] known as [[Yang-Mills theory]] are still open, such as derivations of the phenomena 

* [[quark]] [[confinement]]

and notably

* the [[mass gap problem]], the question of why the [[bound states]] of massless [[quarks]] ([[hadrons]]) have [[mass]]

A survey and problem description is in

Millenium Prize Problem_, 2004 ([pdf](http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/ym2.pdf))
