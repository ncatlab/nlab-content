## Idea ##

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the category $\Theta_n$ -- **Joyal's disk category** -- may be thought of as the full subcategory of the category $Str n Cat$ of [[strict ω-category|strict n-categories]] on $n$-categories that are something like free $n$-categories on pasting diagrams of $n$-[[globe]]s.

In low degree we have

* $\Theta_0 = *$ is the [[point]].

* $\Theta_1 = \Delta$ is the [[simplex category]]: the $n$-[[simplex]] $[n]$ is thought of as a linear [[quiver]] and as such the pasing diagram of $n$ 1-morphisms.

* and so on ...



## Definition ##

### Examples ###

In $\Theta_0$ write $O_0$ for the unique object. Then write in $\Theta_n$ 

$$
  O_n := [1](O_{n-1})
  \,.
$$

This is the strict [[n-category]] free on a single $n$-[[globe]].

## Theta-spaces ##

A local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on the Theta categories is called [[Theta space]]s and models [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-categories]].


## References ##

The $\Theta$-categories were introduced in

* [[Andre Joyal]], _Disks, duality and Theta-categories_

A useful discussion is in

* [[Clemens Berger]], _Iterated wreath product of the simplex category and iterated loop spaces_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv1.library.cornell.edu/abs/math/0512575))

An informal definition is recalled in section 1.1 of

* [[Charles Rezk]], _A cartesian presentation of weak $n$-categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3602))

leading over to the notion of [[Theta space]].
