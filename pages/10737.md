## Idea

$p$-completion is to [[p-adic homotopy theory]] as [[rationalization]] is to [[rational homotopy theory]].

For more see at _[[formal completion]]_.

### Of abelian groups, rings and modules

For $A$ an [[abelian group]] (or [[commutative ring]]) and $p$ a [[prime number]], the _$p$-completion_ of $A$ is the [[limit]]

$$
  A_p^\wedge \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim} A/(p^n A)
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [May Ponto, 10.1.1](#MayPonto)) For more see at _[[formal completion]]_.

$A$ is called _$p$-complete_ if the canonical [[homomorphism]] $A \to A_p^\wedge$ is an [[isomorphism]].


### Of a homotopy type

(...) ([e.g. May-Ponto, 10.2](#MayPonto))

## Properties

The _[[fracture theorem]]_ says that under mild conditions a (stable) homotopy type decomposes into its [[rationalization]] and its $p$-completions.

## Examples

For $A = \mathbb{Z}$ the [[integers]], the $p$-completion is the [[p-adic integers]]. (Notice that here traditionally one writes $\mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z}_p^\wedge$.)  

More generally, if $A$ is [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]], then $A_p^\wedge \simeq A\otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$. (e.g. [May Ponto, p. 154](#MayPonto))
