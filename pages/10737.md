## Idea

$p$-completion is to [[p-adic homotopy theory]] as [[rationalization]] is to [[rational homotopy theory]].

### Of an abelian group

For $A$ an [[abelian group]] (or [[commutative ring]]) and $p$ a [[prime number]], the _$p$-completion_ of $A$ is the [[limit]]

$$
  A_p^\wedge \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim} A/(p^n A)
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [May Ponto, 10.1.1](#MayPonto)) For more see at _[[formal completion]]_.

$A$ is called _$p$-complete_ if the canonical [[homomorphism]] $A \to A_p^\wedge$ is an [[isomorphism]].

### Of a homotopy type

If we have a $R$-module $M$, and a maximal ideal $I$ in $R$, then the $I$-completion of $M$ is given by the colimit of: 
$$... \hookrightarrow M/I^3 \hookrightarrow M/I^2 \hookrightarrow M/I$$
or, equivalently, the colimit of:
$$... \hookrightarrow M \otimes_R R/I^3 \hookrightarrow M\otimes_R R/I^2 \hookrightarrow M \otimes_R R/I$$

If we similarly have an $S$-module (a spectrum) X, then we want the p-completion of $X$ be the colimit of:

$$...\hookrightarrow X \wedge S/p^3 \hookrightarrow X \wedge S/p^2 \hookrightarrow X \wedge S/p$$
or, alternatively, the colimit of: 
$$...\hookrightarrow X \wedge MZ/p^3 \hookrightarrow X \wedge MZ/p^2 \hookrightarrow X \wedge MZ/p$$

Note that $S/p^n$ is the mapping cone of $p^n : S \to S$, so $S/p^n$ is the Moore space $MZ/p^n$, and the two above inductive sequences are equivalent.

To summarize: $p$-Completion of a space/spectrum is equivalently $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-localization, see at _[[localization of a space]]_ [this remark](localization+of+a+space#RelationToCompletion).

## Properties

The _[[fracture theorem]]_ says that under mild conditions a (stable) homotopy type decomposes into its [[rationalization]] and its $p$-completions.

## Examples

For $A = \mathbb{Z}$ the [[integers]], the $p$-completion is the [[p-adic integers]]. (Notice that here traditionally one writes $\mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z}_p^\wedge$.)  

More generally, if $A$ is [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]], then $A_p^\wedge \simeq A\otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$. (e.g. [May Ponto, p. 154](#MayPonto))
