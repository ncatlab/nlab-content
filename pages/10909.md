## Idea

Given an [[adjoint pair]] of [[functors]] $(f^\ast \dashv f_\ast)$ or $(f_! \dashv f^\ast)$ between two [[monoidal categories]] such that $f^\ast$ is a [[strong monoidal functor]], then the _projection morphism_ is the canonical [[natural transformation]] of the form

$$
  B \otimes f_\ast A \longrightarrow f_\ast (f^\ast B \otimes A)
$$

or 

$$
  f_! (f^\ast B \otimes A) \longrightarrow  B \otimes f_! A 
$$

respectively. If these morphisms are [[equivalences]] then one often calls them the **projection formula** or the **reciprocity** relation.

## Examples

Examples include the [[six operations]] setup in [[Grothendieck context]] and [[Wirthm√ºller context]], respectively (in a [[transfer context]] both pushforward maps satisfy their projection formula). In particular in [[representation theory]] and in [[formal logic]] reciprocity is also called _[[Frobenius reciprocity]]_, see there for more.
