## Idea

In the context of [[derived functors in homological algebra]] one often says "$k$th derived functor" for the $k$th[[chain homology]] of a functor applied to a suitable [[resolution]]. Omitting the passage to homology here is then called forming the _total derived functor_. In more general contexts of [[homotopy theory]], that total derived functor would simply be called the _[[derived functor]]_ itself.

See at _[[derived functor in homological algebra]]_ for a detailed discussion.
