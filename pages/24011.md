## Idea

A ternary [[function]] which behaves as simultaneous [[actions]] on a set on both the left and the right side. 

## Definition

Given a [[set]] $S$ and [[monoids]] $(M, e_M, \mu_M)$ and $(N, e_N, \mu_N)$, a **two-sided action** is a ternary function $\alpha:M \times S \times N \to S$ such that 

* for all $s:S$, $\alpha(e_M, s, e_N) = s$

* for all $s:S$, $a:M$, $b:M$, $c:N$, and $d:N$, $\alpha(a, \alpha(b, s, c), d) = \alpha(\mu_M(a, b), s, \mu_N(c, d))$

The [[left action]] is defined as 

$$\alpha_L(a, s) \coloneqq \alpha(a, s, e_N)$$

for all $a:M$ and $s:S$, and the [[right action]] is defined as 

$$\alpha_R(s, c) \coloneqq \alpha(e_M, s, c)$$

for all $c:N$ and $s:S$.
