## Idea

What is called _Spin Chern-Simons theory_ is a [[prequantum field theory]]/[[quantum field theory]] like [[Chern-Simons field theory]] but defined on/restricted to 3-manifolds equipped with [[spin structure]] and making use of that structure to divide the [[action functional]] (in the exponent) by 2.

(Beware that there is also ordinary $G$-Chern-Simons theory for [[gauge group]] $G = Spin(n)$ a [[spin group]], which in traditional parlance one might also pronounce as "Spin Chern-Simons theory", but which is different, in general, from Spin Chern-Simons theory in the sense discussed here.) 


The division by 2 makes the [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|holographically dual]] theory in 2d be the correct [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-dual theory]].  The generalization of the [[Spin structure]] to [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] is that of [[integral Wu structure]]. In the next relevant case of [[7d Chern-Simons theory]] this is related to the flux quantizaton condition on the [[supergravity C-field]] wholse holographically related [[self-dual higher gauge field]] is the 2-form-field in the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[M5-brane]].


## Properties

### Relation to framed Chern-Simons theory

Notice that if a 3-manifold admits a [[spin structure]] then it also admits a [[framing]]. (...)
