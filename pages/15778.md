## Idea

What is called _Spin Chern-Simons theory_ is a [[prequantum field theory]]/[[quantum field theory]] like [[Chern-Simons field theory]] but defined on/restricted to 3-manifolds equipped with [[spin structure]] and making use of that structure to divide the [[action functional]] (in the exponent) by 2.

(Beware that there is also ordinary $G$-Chern-Simons theory for [[gauge group]] $G = Spin(n)$ a [[spin group]], which in traditional parlance one might also pronounce as "Spin Chern-Simons theory", but which is different, i, general, from Spin Chern-Simons theory in the sense discussed here.) 

## Properties

### Relation to framed Chern-Simons theory

Notice that if a 3-manifold admits a [[spin structure]] then it also admits a [[framing]]. (...)
