## Idea

[[super Yang-Mills theory]] in [[dimension]] 5.

## Properties

### As the worldvolume theory of the D4-brane

$D = 5$ SYM may be regarded as the [[worldvolume]] [[physical theory|theory]] on the [[D4-brane]] in [[type II string theory]]. Thought to be obtained via [[double dimensional reduction]] form the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of the [[M5-brane]] ([Witten 11, section 4 and 5](#Witten11)).
