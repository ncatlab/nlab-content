## Definition

A __cyclic group__ is a [[quotient group]] of the [[free group]] on the [[singleton]].

Generally, we consider a cyclic group as a [[group]], that is without specifying which element comprises the generating singleton.  But see [Ring structure](#Ring) below.


## Examples

There is (up to [[isomorphism]]) one free group for every [[natural number]] $n$.  For $n \gt 0$, the [[order of a group|order]] ([[cardinality]]) of the group is $n$ (so [[finite set|finite]]); for $n = 0$, the order is [[countable set|countable]] but [[infinite set|infinite]].

If we identify the free group on the singleton with the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]], then the infinite cyclic group is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself, while the finite cyclic group of order $n$ is $\mathbb{Z}/n$, that is $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo (the [[normal subgroup]] generated by) the integer $n$.  Of course, $\mathbb{Z}$ itself is also $\mathbb{Z}/0$.  One could also consider $\mathbb{Z}/n$ for negative $n$, but this is the same as $\mathbb{Z}/{|n|}$.

The cyclic group of order $n$ may also be identified with a [[subgroup]] of the multiplicative group of [[complex numbers]] (or [[algebraic numbers]]): the group of $n$th roots of $1$.  For $n = 0$, we may pick any non-zero complex number (or even something else) that is *not* a root of $1$ (but there is no standard choice) and take the subgroup generated by it.


## Notation

Besides ‘$\mathbb{Z}/n$’, the cyclic group of order $n$ may also be denoted in other ways: some more complicated variation of ‘$\mathbb{Z}/n$’ (to put 'the \[normal\] subgroup generated by' explicitly in the notation), or else the simplified form ‘$\mathbb{Z}_n$’ (which however conflicts with notation for the $n$-[[adic integers]]).  When written multiplicatively, it may be denoted ‘$Z_n$’ (note the font change) or ‘$C_n$’; either letter here stands for 'cyclic' in one language or another.  (It is a coincidence that the German words 'Zahl', which gives us ‘$\mathbb{Z}$’, and 'zyklisch', which gives us ‘$Z$’, begin with the same letter.)

Besides ‘$\mathbb{Z}$’, the infinite cyclic group may also be denoted in other ways: some variation of ‘$(\mathbb{Z},+)$’ to indicate that we are using *addition* of integers, or any of the above notations with either ‘$0$’ or ‘$\infty$’ in place of ‘$n$’ (depending on whether we think of it as $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $0$ or the cyclic group with order $\infty$).

When written additively, the notation for the elements of a cyclic group are usually just the notation for integers; for the finite cyclic group of order $n$, we use the natural number less than $n$.  In the finite case, we may also use brackets or some other notation to indicate [[equivalence classes]].  When written multiplicatively, any letter (‘$e$’, ‘$x$’, ‘$a$’, ‘$\xi$’, etc) may be taken to stand for the generating element; then any other element is a power of this generator.  When thought of as a multiplicative group of complex numbers, one generator is $\mathrm{e}^{2\mathrm{i}\pi/n}$, and the notation may reflect that.


## Ring structure
   {#Ring}

Let $A$ be a cyclic group, and let $x$ be a generator of $A$.  Then there is a unique [[ring]] structure on $A$ (making the original group the additive group of the ring) such that $x$ is the multiplicative identity $1$.

If we identify $A$ with the additive group $\mathbb{Z}/n$ and pick (the equivalence class of) the integer $1$ for $x$, then the resulting ring is precisely the [[quotient ring]] $\mathbb{Z}/n$.

In this way, a cyclic group equipped with the [[extra structure]] of a generator is the same thing (in the sense that their [[groupoids]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]) as a ring with the [[extra property]] that the underlying additive group is cyclic.
