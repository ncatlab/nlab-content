## Definition

A __cyclic group__ is a [[quotient group]] of the [[free group]] on the [[singleton]].

Generally, we consider a cyclic group as a [[group]], that is without specifying which element comprises the generating singleton.  But see [Ring structure](#Ring) below.


## Examples

There is (up to [[isomorphism]]) one cyclic group for every [[natural number]] $n$, denoted

$$
  \mathbb{Z}_n \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

For $n \gt 0$, the [[order of a group|order]] ([[cardinality]]) of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is $n$ (so [[finite set|finite]]); for $n = 0$, which is the group of [[integers]]

$$
  \mathbb{Z}_0 \coloneqq \mathbb{Z}
$$

the [[order of a group|order]] is [[countable set|countable]] but [[infinite set|infinite]].

If we identify the [[free group]] on the singleton with the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]], then the infinite cyclic group is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself, while the finite cyclic group of order $n$ is $\mathbb{Z}/n$, that is $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo (the [[normal subgroup]] generated by) the integer $n$.  Of course, $\mathbb{Z}$ itself is also $\mathbb{Z}/0$.  One could also consider $\mathbb{Z}/n$ for negative $n$, but this is the same as $\mathbb{Z}/{|n|}$.

The cyclic group of order $n$ may also be identified with a [[subgroup]] of the multiplicative group of [[complex numbers]] (or [[algebraic numbers]]): the group of $n$th roots of $1$.  For $n = 0$, we may pick any non-zero complex number (or even something else) that is *not* a root of $1$ (but there is no standard choice) and take the subgroup generated by it.

Dedicated entries exist for:

* [[cyclic group of order 2]]

* [[cyclic group of order 3]]

* [[cyclic group of order 4]]


## Notation

Besides '$\mathbb{Z}/n$', the cyclic group of order $n$ may also be denoted in other ways: some more complicated variation of '$\mathbb{Z}/n$' (to put 'the \[normal\] subgroup generated by' explicitly in the notation), or else the simplified form '$\mathbb{Z}_n$' (which however conflicts with notation for the $n$-[[adic integers]]).  When written multiplicatively, it may be denoted '$Z_n$' (note the font change) or '$C_n$'; either letter here stands for 'cyclic' in one language or another.  (It is a coincidence that the German words 'Zahl', which gives us '$\mathbb{Z}$', and 'zyklisch', which gives us '$Z$', begin with the same letter.)

Besides '$\mathbb{Z}$', the infinite cyclic group may also be denoted in other ways: some variation of '$(\mathbb{Z},+)$' to indicate that we are using *addition* of integers, or any of the above notations with either '$0$' or '$\infty$' in place of '$n$' (depending on whether we think of it as $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $0$ or the cyclic group with order $\infty$).

When written additively, the notation for the elements of a cyclic group are usually just the notation for integers; for the finite cyclic group of order $n$, we use the natural number less than $n$.  In the finite case, we may also use brackets or some other notation to indicate [[equivalence classes]].  When written multiplicatively, any letter ('$e$', '$x$', '$a$', '$\xi$', etc) may be taken to stand for the generating element; then any other element is a power of this generator.  When thought of as a multiplicative group of complex numbers, one generator is $\mathrm{e}^{2\mathrm{i}\pi/n}$, and the notation may reflect that.

## Properties

### Ring structure
   {#Ring}

Let $A$ be a cyclic group, and let $x$ be a generator of $A$.  Then there is a unique [[ring]] structure on $A$ (making the original group the additive group of the ring) such that $x$ is the multiplicative identity $1$.

If we identify $A$ with the additive group $\mathbb{Z}/n$ and pick (the equivalence class of) the integer $1$ for $x$, then the resulting ring is precisely the [[quotient ring]] $\mathbb{Z}/n$.

In this way, a cyclic group equipped with the [[extra structure]] of a generator is the same thing (in the sense that their [[groupoids]] are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]) as a ring with the [[extra property]] that the underlying additive group is cyclic.

For $n \gt 0$, the number of ring structures on the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/n$, which is the same as the number of generators, is $\phi(n)$, the [[totient function|Euler totient]] of $n$; the generators are those $i$ that are [[relatively prime numbers|relatively prime]] to $n$.  While $\phi(1) = 1$, otherwise $\phi(n) \gt 1$ (another way to see that we have a structure and not just a property).  For $\mathbb{Z}$ itself, there are two ring structures, since $1$ and $-1$ are the generators (and these are relatively prime to $0$).

### Fundamental theorem of cyclic groups
  {#FundamentalTheoremOfCyclicGroups}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is precisely one [[subgroup]] of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{N}$ of [[order of a group|order]] $d \in \mathbb{N}$ for each factor of $d$ in $n$, and this is the subgroup [[generators and relations|generated]] by $n/d \in \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.

Moreover, the [[lattice of subgroups]] of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalently the dual of the lattice of natural numbers $\leq n$ ordered by divisibility.

(e.g [Aluffi 09, pages 83-84](#Aluffi09))

This is a special case of the _[[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]_. See there for more.


### Relation to finite abelian groups

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every [[finite abelian group]] is a [[direct sum of abelian groups]] over cyclic groups.

See at _[[finite abelian group]]_ for details.


### Group cohomology

For a discussion of the [[group cohomology]] of cyclic groups see at _[[projective resolution]]_ in the section _[Cohomology of cyclic groups](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/projective+resolution#CohomologyOfCyclicGroups)_.

Relevant for [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is the fact

$$
  H^3_{grp}(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, U(1)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

### Linear representations

We discuss some of the [[representation theory]] of cyclic grou

+-- {: .num_example #IrreducibleRealRepresentationsOfCyclicGroups}
###### Example
**([[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real numbers|real]] [[linear representations]] of [[cyclic groups]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 2$,
the [[isomorphism classes]] of [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real numbers|real]] [[linear representations]] of the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/n$ are given by precisely the following:

1. the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[trivial representation]] $\mathbf{1}$;

1. the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[sign representation]] $\mathbf{1}_{sgn}$;

1. the 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] standard representations $\mathbf{2}_k$ of [[rotations]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] by [[angles]] that are [[integer]] multiples of $2 \pi k/n$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $0 \lt k \lt n/2$;

   hence the [[restricted representations]] of the defining real rep of [[SO(2)]] under the [[subgroup]] inclusions $\mathbb{Z}/n \hookrightarrow SO(2)$, hence the representations generated by [[real number|real]] $2 \times 2$ [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]] [[matrices]] of the form

   $$
    \rho_{\mathbf{2}_k}(1)
    \;=\;
     \left(
       \array{
         cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta)
         \\
         sin(\theta) & \phantom{-}cos(\theta)
       }
     \right)
     \phantom{AA}
     \text{with}
     \;
     \theta = 2 \pi \tfrac{k}{n}
     \,,
   $$ 

  (For $k = n/2$ the corresponding 2d representation is the [[direct sum]] of two copies of the [[sign representation]]: $\mathbf{2}_{n/2} \simeq \mathbf{1}_{sgn} \oplus \mathbf{1}_{sgn}$, and hence not [[irrep|irreducible]]. Moreover, for $k \gt n/2$ we have that $\mathbf{2}_{k}$ is irreducible, but [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbf{2}_{n-k} \simeq \mathbf{2}_{-k}$).

In summary:

$$
  Rep^{irr}_{\mathbb{R}}
  \big(
    \mathbb{Z}/n  
  \big)_{/\sim}
  \;=\;
  \big\{
    \mathbf{1},
    \mathbf{1}_{sgn},
    \mathbf{2}_k
    \;\vert\;
    0 \lt k \lt n/2
  \big\}
