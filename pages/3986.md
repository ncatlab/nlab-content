A trigonometric identity is (formally) a [[commutative diagram]] in the [[category]] of [[cartesian spaces]] and [[partial functions]] whose edges are labelled by [[rational functions]] (or sometimes [[algebraic functions]]) and [[trigonometric functions]]. 

Slightly more precisely: each rational function $p(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is interpreted as a [[partial function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \hookleftarrow D \stackrel{f}{\to} \mathbb{R}^n$ where $D$ is the "natural domain" of $p$ (see [[rational function]] for more discussion); these are partial [[analytic functions]]. The basic trigonometric functions $\sin, \cos$ are (total) analytic functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. All of these may be interpreted as partial functions $\mathbb{R}^n \rightharpoonup \mathbb{R}^n$, and generate a class of functions by applying the [[monoidal category]] structure on the category of partial functions that is induced by the [[cartesian product]] on cartesian spaces. A trigonometric identity is then (formally) an [[equality]] of morphisms in the monoidal category thus generated. 

Of course, this is complete overkill; category theorists are not oblivious to the fact that this is exactly the kind of description lampooned in Linderholm's _Mathematics Made Difficult_. It's just a formal way of covering bases. So let us add that in practice, a trigonometric identity usually involves functions obtained by substituting trigonometric functions into rational functions, or substituting rational _linear_ (affine) functions into trigonometric functions: the class of functions considered is usually fairly limited in scope. Virtually all trigonometric identities can be seen as arising from suitable [[exponential function]] identities on _[[complex numbers]]_ such as 

* $\exp(i t) = \cos(t) + i\sin(t)$ ([[Euler's formula]]); 

* $\exp(z + w) = \exp(z)\exp(w)$,

* $\widebar{\exp(z)} = \exp(\widebar{z})$.
