My main research interest is on what happens when we _drop all equalities between morphisms_ from categorical proofs; if we do that in the right way we are left with all the constructions (the "fun part") and we lose the equations (the "boring part"). The best article I've written so far - ["Internal Diagrams in Category Theory"](http://angg.twu.net/math-b.html#internal-diags-in-ct) (2010) - is an introduction to that.

I work in a campus in the countryside of Brazil that is a kind of (academical) nowhere. In order to cope with the, hm, psychological effects of that I have started, together with a few friends, an informal group to study the psychodynamics of corruption and apathy using tools from the Social Sciences. Our [notes](http://angg.twu.net/psi-cor.html) are mostly in Portuguese at the moment.

The 2D diagrams and derivation trees in my papers and notes are all created with this package: [dednat4](http://angg.twu.net/dednat4.html). Its documentation is precarious and its code is a mess, but its [rewrite](http://angg.twu.net/dednat5/) is 95% finished, and I am migrating to it slowly. If you think you would like to use it, then get in touch to speed things up. 8-)
