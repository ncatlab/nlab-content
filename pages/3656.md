## Idea
This page is devoted right now to explain the spectrum condition of the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]], future versions of the page may go into more details of this vast subject.

## Spectrum of Representations of Groups
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a locally compact, abelian topological group, $\hat \mathcal{G}$ the character group of $\mathcal{G}$, $\mathcal{H}$ a  Hilbert space and $\mathcal{U}$ an unitary representation of $\mathcal{G}$ in the algebra of bounded operators of $\mathcal{H}$.
The following theorem is sometimes called (classical) **SNAG** theorem (SNAG = Stone-Naimark-Ambrose-Godement):

* **Theorem**: There is a unique regular spectral measure $\mathcal{P}$ on $\hat \mathcal{G}$ such that:

$$
     \mathcal{U}(g) = \int_{\chi\in\hat \mathcal{G}} \langle g, \chi\rangle \mathcal{P}(d\chi) \qquad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}
$$
 =--
The equality holds in the weak sense, i.e. the integral converges in the weak operator topology.
The **spectrum** of $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{G})$, denoted by $spec\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{G})$, is defined to be the support of this spectral measure $\mathcal{P}$.

### The Case of the Translation Group
The groups of translations $\mathcal{T}$ on $\R^n$ is both isomorph to $\R^n$ and to it's own character group, every character is of the form $a \mapsto exp(i \langle a, k\rangle)$ for a fixed $k \in \R^n$. So in this case theorem \ref{specmeasure} becomes:
$$
\mathcal{U}(t) = \int_{k\in \R^n} e^{i \langle t, k\rangle} \mathcal{P}(k) \qquad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
$$
This allows us to talk about the support of the spectral measure, i.e. the spectrum of $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{T})$, as a subset of $\R^n$.
