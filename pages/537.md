## Idea

The notion of _disjoint coproduct_ is a generalization to arbitrary [[categories]] of that of _[[disjoint union]]_ of sets.

One says that a [[coproduct]] $X + Y$ of two [[objects]] $X, Y$ in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is _disjoint_ if the [[intersection]] of $X$ with $Y$ in $X \coprod Y$ is [[initial object|empty]]. In this case one writes $X \coprod Y \coloneqq X + Y$ for the coproduct and speaks of the _[[disjoint union]]_ of $X$ with $Y$.

## Definition

### In a category

A [[coproduct]] $a+b$ in a [[category]] is **disjoint** if

1. the coprojections $a\to a+b$ and $b\to a+b$ are [[monomorphism|monic]], and 

2. their [[intersection]] is an [[initial object]].

Equivalently, this means we have [[pullback]] squares

$$
\array{ a & \to & a &&&
b & \to & b &&&
0 & \to & b\\
\downarrow && \downarrow &&&
\downarrow && \downarrow &&&
\downarrow && \downarrow \\
a & \to & a+b &&&
b & \to & a+b &&&
a & \to & a+b}
$$

An arbitrary coproduct $\coprod_i a_i$ is disjoint if each coprojection $a_i\to \coprod_i a_i$ is monic and the intersection of any two is initial.  Note that every 0-ary coproduct (that, is initial object) is disjoint.

### In a bicategory

## Properties

### Characterization of extensivity and of sheaf toposes

A category having all finitary disjoint coproducts is half of the condition for a category to be [[extensive category|extensive]].  

Having all small disjoint coproducts is one of the conditions in [[Giraud's theorem]] characterizing [[sheaf toposes]].

### In coherent categories

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[coherent category]]. If $X, Y \hookrightarrow Z$ are two [[subobjects]] of some [[object]] $Z \in \mathcal{C}$ and are disjoint, in that their [[intersection]] in $Z$ is [[initial object|empty]], $X \cap Y \simeq\emptyset$, then their [[union]] $X \cup Y$ is their (disjoint) [[coproduct]].

This apears as ([Johnstone, cor. A1.4.4](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .num_defn #PositiveCategory}
###### Definition

A coherent category in which all coproducts are disjoint is also called a **[[positive category|positive coherent category]]**.

###### Example

Every [[extensive category]] is in particular positive, by definition.

=--

In a positive coherent category, every morphism into a coproduct factors through the coproduct coprojections:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a postive coherent category, def. \ref{PositiveCategory}, and let $f \colon A \to X \coprod Y$ be a [[morphism]]. Then the two [[subobjects]] $f^*(X) \hookrightarrow A$ and $f^*(Y) \hookrightarrow Y$ of $A$, being the [[pullbacks]] in 

$$
  \array{
    f^* (X) &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_X}}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& X \coprod Y
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    f^* (Y) &\to& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_Y}}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\to}& X \coprod Y
  }
$$

are disjoint in $A$ and $A$ is their disjoint coproduct

$$
  A \simeq f^*(X) \coprod f^*(Y)
  \,.
$$

This appears in ([Johnstone, p. 34](#Johnstone)).

###### Remark

This means that if $A \in \mathcal{C}$ itself is indecomposable in that it is not a coproduct of two objects in a non-trivial way, for instance if $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[extensive category]] and $A \in \mathcal{C}$ is a [[connected object]], then every morphism $A \to X \coprod Y$ into a disjoint coproduct factors through one of the two canonical inclusions.
