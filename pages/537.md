## Definition

A [[coproduct]] $a+b$ in a [[category]] is **disjoint** if

1. the coprojections $a\to a+b$ and $b\to a+b$ are [[monomorphism|monic]], and 

2. their [[intersection]] is an [[initial object]].

Equivalently, this means we have [[pullback]] squares

$$
\array{ a & \to & a &&&
b & \to & b &&&
0 & \to & b\\
\downarrow && \downarrow &&&
\downarrow && \downarrow &&&
\downarrow && \downarrow \\
a & \to & a+b &&&
b & \to & a+b &&&
a & \to & a+b}
$$

An arbitrary coproduct $\coprod_i a_i$ is disjoint if each coprojection $a_i\to \coprod_i a_i$ is monic and the intersection of any two is initial.  Note that every 0-ary coproduct (that, is initial object) is disjoint.

Having all finitary disjoint coproducts is half of the condition for a category to be [[extensive category|extensive]].  Having all small disjoint coproducts is one of the conditions in Giraud's theorem characterizing [[Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck toposes]].


## Generalizations

A coproduct $a+b$ in a [[bicategory]] is disjoint if $a\to a+b$ and $b\to a+b$ are [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] and their [[comma object]] is initial.
