on the formalization of [[unity of opposites]] in [[calculus]] and [[physics]]. 

{#WhatItIsAbout} Section II re-casts the statement of the *[[Hadamard lemma]]* via the three homomorphisms of [[rings]] of [[smooth functions]] on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ and its [[product manifold]] $X \times X$ (the article generalizes this to [[fiber products]] but that's not necessary to appreciate the idea):

$$
  C^\infty
  \big(
    X \times X
  \big)
  \underoverset
    {\xleftarrow{\;\;pr_1^\ast\;\;}}
    {\xleftarrow{\;\;pr_2^\ast\;\;}}
    {\xrightarrow{\phantom{----}diag^\ast\phantom{----}}}
  C^\infty
  \big(
    X
  \big)
  \,,
$$

where $pr_i \,\colon\, X \times X \xrightarrow{\;} X$ are the two [[projections]] out of the [[Cartesian product]] and $diag \,\colon\, X \xrightarrow{\;} X \times X$ denotes the [[diagonal map]]. So: 

* for $y \,\in\, C^\infty(X)$ we have

  $$
    pr_1^\ast(y) \,\colon\, (x_1, x_2) \,\mapsto\, f(x_1)
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;
    pr_2^\ast(y) \,\colon\, (x_1, x_2) \,\mapsto\, f(x_2)
  $$

* for $g \,\in\, C^\infty(X \times X)$ we have

  $$
    diag^\ast(g) \,\colon\, x \,\mapsto\, g(x,x)
    \,.
  $$

These are the expressions that enter the formulation of the [[Hadamard lemma]] ([here](Hadamard+lemma#HadamardLemma)) and its corollary ([here](Hadamard+lemma#AndItsCorollary)).

Compare this to the discussion at *[[adjoint cylinder]]* and then to *[[objective and subjective logic]]* and maybe also *[[Aufhebung]]*.

### Abstract

> A significant fraction of dialectical philosophy can be modeled mathematically through the use of "[[adjoint cylinder|cylinders]]" (diagrams of shape $\Delta_1$) in a category, wherein the two identical [[subobjects]] (united by the third map in the diagram) are "opposite". In a [[bicategory]], oppositeness can be very effectively characterized in terms of [[adjunction|adjointness]], but even in an ordinary category it may sometimes be given a useful definition. For example, an effective basis for teaching calculus is a ringed category satisfying the Hadamard-Marx property. The description in engineering mechanics of continuous bodies that can undergo cracking is clarified by an example involving lattices, raising a new questions about the foundations of topology. 

> ($\Delta_1$ is the category of order-preserving maps between totally-ordered sets of one and two elements, respectively.)
