## Idea

_Stokes theorem_ asserts that the [[integration of differential forms]] of the [[de Rham differential]] of a [[differential form]] over a domain equals the integral of the form itself over the [[boundary]] of the domain.

## Statement

### Traditional statement

Let 

$$
  \Delta_{Diff} : \Delta \to Diff
$$

be the [[cosimplicial object]] of standard $k$-[[simplices]] in [[SmoothMfd]]: in degree $k$ this is the standard $k$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^k_{Diff} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ regarded as a [[smooth manifold]] [[manifold with corners|with boundary and corners]]. This may be parameterized as

$$
  \Delta^k = \{ t^1, \cdots, t^k \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} | \sum_i t^i \leq 1\}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^k
  \,.
$$

In this parameterization the coface maps of $\Delta_{Diff}$ are 

$$
  \partial_i : (t^1, \cdots, t^{k-1}) \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
       (t^1, \cdots, t^{i-1}, t^{i+1} , \cdots, t^{k-1}) & | i \gt 0
       \\
       (1- \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} t^i, t^1, \cdots, t^{k-1})
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

For $X$ any [[smooth manifold]] a **smooth $k$-simplex in $X$** is a [[smooth function]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^k \to X
  \,.
$$

The **boundary** of this simplex in $X$ is the [[chain]] (formal linear combination of smooth $(k-1)$-simplices)

$$
  \partial \sigma = \sum_{i = 0}^k (-1)^i \sigma \circ \partial_i
  \,.
$$


Let $\omega \in \Omega^{k-1}(X)$ be a degree $(k-1)$-[[differential form]] on $X$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(Stokes theorem)**

The [[integral]] of $\omega$ over the boundary of the simplex equals the integral of its [[de Rham differential]] over the simplex itself

$$
  \int_{\partial \sigma} \omega = \int_\sigma d \omega
  \,.
$$

=--

It follows that for $C$ any $k$-[[chain]] in $X$ and $\partial C$ its boundary $(k-1)$-chain, we have

$$
  \int_{\partial C} \omega = \int_{C} d \omega
  \,.
$$

More generally:


+-- {: .num_prop #StokesTheoremForFiberIntegration}
###### Proposition
**(Stokes theorem for [[fiber integration]])**

If $U$ is any [[smooth manifold]] and $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(U \times \sigma)$ is a differential form on the [[Cartesian product]], then with respect to [[fiber integration|fiber-wise]] [[integration of differential forms]] 

$$
  \int_\sigma \;\colon\;
  \Omega^{\bullet + dim(\sigma)}(U \times \sigma)
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega^\bullet(U)
$$

along $U \times \sigma \overset{pr_1}{\to} U$ we have

$$
  \int_\sigma d \omega
  \;=\;
  \int_{\partial_\sigma} \omega
  +
  (-1)^{dim(\sigma)} d \int_\sigma \omega 
  \,.
$$

### Abstract formulation in cohesive homotopy-type theory
 {#FormulationInCohesiveHomotopyTypeTheory}

We discuss here a general abstract formulation of differential forms, their integration and Stokes theorem in the axiomatics of [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] (following [Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13, theorem 3.2](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)).


Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] and write $T \mathbf{H}$ for its [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

Assume that there is an [[interval object]] 

$$
  \ast \cup \ast \stackrel{(i_0, i_1)}{\longrightarrow}  \Delta^1
$$ 

"exhibiting the cohesion" (see at _[[continuum]]_) in that there is a (chosen) [[equivalence]] between the [[shape modality]] $\Pi$ and the [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] $L_{\Delta^1}$ at the the [[projection]] maps out of [[Cartesian products]] with this line $\Delta^1\times (-) \to (-)$

$$
  \Pi \simeq L_{\Delta^1}
  \,.
$$ 

This is the case for instance for the "standard [[continuum]]", the [[real line]] in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]].

It follows in particular that there is a chosen [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] 

$$
  \flat(\mathbf{H})\simeq L_{\Delta^1}\mathbf{H}
$$

between the [[flat modality|flat]] [[modal types|modal homotopy-types]] and the $\Delta^1$-homotopy invariant homotopy-types.

Given a [[stable homotopy type]] $\hat E \in Stab(\mathbf{H})\hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}$ [[cohesion]] provides two objects 

$$
  \Pi_{dR} \Omega \hat E \,,\;\;  \flat_{dR}\Sigma \hat E
  \;\;
  \in Stab(\mathbf{H})
$$

which may be interpreted as [[de Rham complexes]] with [[coefficients]] in $\Pi(\flat_{dR} \Sigma \hat E)$, the first one restricted to negative degree, the second to non-negative degree. Moreover, there is a canonical map

$$
  \array{
    \Pi_{dR}\Omega \hat E && \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow} && \flat_{dR}\Sigma \hat E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\iota}}\searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta_{\hat E}}}
    \\
    && 
    \hat E
  }
$$

which interprets as the [[de Rham differential]] $\mathbf{d}$. See at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_ for details. 

Throughout in the following we leave the "inclusion" $\iota$ of "differential forms regarded as $\hat E$-connections on trivial $E$-bundles" implicit.

+-- {: .num_defn #CohesiveIntegrationOfDifferentialForms}
###### Definition

[[integration of differential forms|Integration of differential forms]] is the map

$$
  \int_{\Delta^1} \;\colon\;  [\Delta^1, \flat_{dR}\Sigma \hat E] \longrightarrow \Pi_{dR}\Omega \hat E
$$

which is induced via the [[homotopy cofiber]] property of $\flat_{dR}\Omega \hat E$ from the [[counit of a comonad|counit]] naturality square of the [[flat modality]] on $[(\ast \coprod \ast \stackrel{(i_0, i_1)}{\to} \Delta ^1 ), -]$, using that this square exhibits a [[null homotopy]] due to the $\Delta^1$-homotopy invariance of $\flat \hat E$.

###### Proposition

Stokes' theorem holds:

$$
  \int_{\Delta^1} \circ \mathbf{d} 
  \;\simeq\; 
  i_1^\ast - i_0^\ast
  \,.
