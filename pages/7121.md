## Idea

There are various attempts/speculations/proposals to use [[p-adic numbers]] in place of [[real numbers]] in the description of [[physics]].

Historically what initiated much of this development was the observation in ([Volovich 87](#Volovich87), reviewed in [VVZ 95, section XIV](#VVZ95)) that the [[integral]] expression for the [[Veneziano amplitude]] of the [[open string|open]] [[bosonic string]] naturally generalizes from an integral over the [[real numbers]] (which in this case parameterize the [[boundary]] of the [[open string]] [[worldsheet]]) to the [[p-adic numbers]]. Since this concerns the [[bosonic string]] [[tachyon]] [[state]], such [[p-adic string theory]] has been discussed a lot in the context of [[tachyon condensation]] and [[Sen's conjecture]] ([Cottrell 02](#Cottrell02)).

Generally, the development of string theory has shown that its [[worldsheet]] is usefully regarded as an object in [[algebraic geometry]] (see also at _[[number theory and physics]]_) and mathematically the generalization from [[algebraic varieties]] over the [[complex numbers]] to more general algebraic varieties (or [[schemes]]) is often natural, if not compelling. For instance when the [[Witten genus]] (essentially the [[partition function]] of the [[superstring]]) is refined to the [[string orientation of tmf]] then the [[elliptic curves]] over the [[complex numbers]] which serve as the [[torus|toroidal]] [[worldsheets]] over the [[complex numbers]] are generalized to [[elliptic curves]] over general [[rings]] and by the [[fracture theorems]] the computations in [[tmf]] in fact typically proceed by decomposing the general problem into that of ellitpic curves over the [[rational numbers]] and over the [[p-adic integers]]. See at _[[p-adic string theory]]_ for more on this.
