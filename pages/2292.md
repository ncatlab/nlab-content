## Idea

Given any [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] $E$, then for each [[topological space]] $X$, there is, by definition, the [[graded abelian group]] 

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \in Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

This is the _$E$-[[cohomology group]]_ of $X$. Now if $E$ is a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]], then these groups inherit the structure of [[rings]]. As such

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \in Ring^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$  

is the **$E$-cohomology ring** of $X$.

Analogously for various suitable generalizations of the nature of $E$ and $X$  (see at _[[generalized cohomology]]_).
