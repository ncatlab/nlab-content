## Idea

Similar to the discussion at _[[cohomology group]]_, a [[cohomology]] set $H^\bullet(X,A)$ may have the structure of a [[ring]] if the [[coefficient]] object $A$ suitably does. 

In particular for $\mathbf{H} = L_{whe}$[[Top]], then $H^*(X,A)$ is a ring when $A$ is an $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-ring|ring]].
