###### Definition

The **Sierpinski [[topos]]** is the [[arrow category]] of [[Set]]. 

Equivalently, this is the [[category of presheaves]] over the [[interval category]] $\Delta[1] := \mathbf{2} = \{0 \to 1\}$, or equivalently the [[category of sheaves]] over the [[Sierpinski space]] $Sierp$

$$
  Sh(Sierp) \simeq PSh(\Delta[1]) \simeq Set^{\Delta[1]}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Similarly, the **Sierpinski [[(∞,1)-topos]]** is the arrow category $\infty Grpd^{\Delta[1]}$ of [[∞Grpd]]. 

Equivalently this is the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on $\Delta[1]$ and equivalently the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $Sierp$:

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Sierp)
  \simeq
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(\Delta[1])
  \simeq
  \infty Grpd^{\Delta[1]}
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Presentation and Homotopy type theory

Being a [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]], the Sierpinski [[(∞,1)-topos]] is [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by any of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]  $[\Delta[1], sSet]$.

Specifically the [[Reedy model structure]] of [[simplicial presheaves]] on the [[interval category]] $[\Delta[1], sSet]_{Reedy}$ provides a [[univalence|univalent]] model for [[homotopy type theory]] in the Sierpinski $(\infty,1)$-topos ([Shulman](#Shulman))

###### Proposition

###### Remark

The fact that the Sierpienski $(\infty,1)$-topos is, therefore, in particular 

1. a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]];

1. an [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]];

1. a [[local (∞,1)-topos]]

all follow directly from the fact that it is the image, under [[localic reflection]], of the [[Sierpinski space]] (that it is [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos|0-localic]], its [[n-truncated|(-1)-truncation]] being the [[frame]] of opens of the Sierpinski space).

That space $Sierp$, in turn,

1. is a [[contractible topological space]];

1. a [[locally contractible topological space]].

1. has a [[focal point]]

which implies the coresponding three properties of the Sierpinski $\infty$-topos above.

###### Remark

By the discussion at _[[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]_ every such may be thought of as a _fat point_, the abstract _cohesive blob_. In this case, this fat point _is_ the Sierpinski space. This space can be thought of as being the abstract "point with open neighbourhood".

###### Remark


Accordingly, the objects of the Sierpienski $(\infty,1)$-topos may be thought of as [[∞-groupoids]] equipped with the notion of [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesion]] modeled on this: they are [[bundles]] $[P \to X]$ of [[∞-groupoids]] whose [[fibers]] are regarded as being [geometrically contractible](cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos+--+structures#Homotopy), in that

$$
  \Pi([P \to X]) \simeq X
$$

and so in particular

$$
  \Pi([Q \to *]) \simeq *
  \,.
$$

Hence these objects are [[discrete ∞-groupoids]] $X$, to each of whose points $ x : * \to X$ may be attached a contractible cohesive blob with inner structure given by the $\infty$-groupoid $P_x := P \times_X \{x\}$.

Accordingly, the _underlying_ $\infty$-groupoid of such a bundle $[P \to X]$ is the union

$$
  \Gamma([P \to X]) \simeq P
$$

of the discrete base space and the inner structure of the fibers.

The [[discrete object]] in the Sierpienski $(\infty,1)$-topos on a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] $X$ is the bundle 

$$
  coDisc(X) \simeq [X \stackrel{id}{\to} X]
$$ 

which is $X$ with "no cohesive blobs attached".

Finally the [[codiscrete object]] in the Sierpinski $(\infty,1)$-topos on a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] $X$ is 

$$
  coDisc(X) \simeq [X \to *]
  \,,
$$ 

the structure where all of $X$ is regarded as one single contractible cohesive ball.
