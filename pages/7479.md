## Definition

The _Sierpinski topos_ is the [[arrow category]] of [[Set]]. This is the [[category of presheaves]] over the [[interval category]] $\mathbf{2} = \{0 \to 1\}$. 

The latter is, the category of non-empty [[open subsets]] of the [[Sierpinski space]], and its trivial [[Grothendieck topology]] is that inherited from the standard topology inherited from the inclusion into the [[category of opens]] of the Sierpinksi space.

## Properties

The Sierpinski topos is a [[cohesive topos]], see the disussion [here](nlab/show/cohesive%20topos#FamiliesOfSets).
