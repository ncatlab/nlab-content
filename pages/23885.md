## Idea

The notion of a *meet-semilattice object* is the generalization of that of *[[meet-semilattice]]* as one passes from the ambient [[category of sets]] [[internalization|into]] more general ambient  [[categories]] with suitable properties.


## Definition

In a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, a **meet-semilattice object** is a [[cartesian monoidal preordered object]] that is also a [[partially ordered object]].
