# Kleisli category
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

Given a [[monad]] $T$ on some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, the _Kleisli category_ of $T$ has as [[objects]] the objects of $\mathcal{C}$, but a morphism $X \to Y$ in the Kleisli category is a morphism $X \to T(Y)$ in $\mathcal{C}$. The monad structure induces a natural [[composition]] of such "$T$-shifted" morphisms.

Equivalently, the Kleisli category is the full [[subcategory]] of the [[Eilenberg–Moore category]] of $T$ on the [[free construction|free]] [[algebra for a monad|T-algebras]] (the free $T$[[modules]]).


## Definition

Let $\mathbf{T}=(T,\mu,\eta)$ be a [[monad]] in [[Cat]], where $T:C\to C$ is an [[endofunctor]] with multiplication $\mu:T T\to T$ and unit $\eta:Id_C\to T$.

###### Definition

A __free $\mathbf{T}$-[[algebra|algebra over a monad]]__ (or free $\mathbf{T}$-module) is a $\mathbf{T}$-algebra (module) of the form $(T(M),\mu_M)$, where the [[action]] is the component of multiplication transformation $\mu_M : T(T(M))\to T(M)$.

###### Definition

The __Kleisli category__ $C_{\mathbf{T}}$ of the monad $\mathbf{T}$   the [[subcategory]] of the [[Eilenberg–Moore category]] $C^{\mathbf{T}}$
on the free $\mathbf{T}$-algebras.

###### Remark

If $U:C^{\mathbf{T}}\to C$ is the [[forgetful functor]] and $F: C\to C^{\mathbf{T}}$ is the [[free functor|free algebra functor]] $F: M\mapsto (T M,\mu_M)$, then the Kleisli category is simply the [[full subcategory]] of $C^{\mathbf{T}}$ containing those objects in the image of $F$.

### In terms of Kleisli morphisms

As another way of looking at this, we can keep the same objects as in $C$ but redefine the morphisms. This was the original Kleisli construction: 


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **Kleisli category** $C_{\mathbf{T}}$ has as objects the objects of $C$, and as [[morphisms]] $M\to N$ the elements of the [[hom-set]] $C(M,T(N))$, in other words [[morphisms]] of the form $M \to T(N)$ in $C$, called **Kleisli morphisms**.

Composition is given by the **Kleisli composition** rule $g\circ_{Kleisli} f = \mu_P\circ T(g)\circ f$
(as in the [[Grothendieck construction]] (here $M\stackrel{f}\to N\stackrel{g}\to P$).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

More explicitly, this means that the Kleisli-composite of $f : x \to T y$ with $g : y \to T z$ is the morphism

$$
  x \stackrel{f}{\to} T y 
  \stackrel{T g}{\to}
  T T y \stackrel{\mu y}{\to}
  T y
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This Kleisli composition plays an important role in [[computer science]]; for this, see the article at [[monad (in computer science)]].

## Properties

### Universal properties

In more general 2-categories the [[universal properties]] of [[Kleisli objects]] are dual to the universal properties of [[Eilenberg–Moore objects]].

### In functional programming

In [[type theory|typed]] [[functional programming]] Kleisli composition is used to model functions with side-effects and [[computation]]. See at _[[monad (in computer science)]]_ for more on this.
