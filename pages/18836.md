Morse potential is one of the standard 1-dimensional potentials which are used mainly in quantum mechanics (especially in atomic and molecular physics). If $r$ is the coordinate (say, the distance between atoms) in $\mathbb{R}_+$, and $l, D$ constants ($l$ being the scale of the system) then one of the standard forms of Morse potential is 

$$
V(r) = D (e^{- 2 x/l} - 2 e^{-x/l})
$$

up to addition of physically irrelevant constant summand this is the same as $D (1 - exp(-x/l))^2$.
