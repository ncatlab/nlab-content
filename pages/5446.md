## Idea

While a [[homomorphism]] of [[magmas]] (including [[groups]], [[rings]], etc) must preserve multiplication, an _antihomomorphism_ must instead _reverse_ multiplication.


## Definitions

Let $A$ and $B$ be [[magmas]], or more generally [[magma objects]] [[internalisation|in]] any [[symmetric monoidal category]] $C$.  (Examples include [[groups]], which are magmas with extra properties; [[rings]], which are magma objects in [[Ab]] with extra proprties; etc.)

An __antihomomorphism__ from $A$ to $B$ is a [[function]] (or $C$-morphism) $f\colon A \to B$ such that:

*  for every two ([[generalised element|generalised]]) elements $x, y$ of $A$, $f(x y) = f(y) f(x)$.

Note that for magma objects in $C$, the left-hand side of this equation is a generalised element of $B$ whose source is ${|x|} \otimes {|y|}$ (where ${|x|}$ and ${|y|}$ are the sources of the generalised elements $x$ and $y$ and $\otimes$ is the [[tensor product]] in $C$), while the right-hand side is a generalised element of $B$ whose source is ${|y|} \otimes {|x|}$.  Therefore, this definition only makes unambiguous sense because $C$ is symmetric monoidal, using the unique [[natural isomorphism]] ${|x|} \otimes {|y|} \cong {|y|} \otimes {|x|}$.

An __antiautomorphism__ is an antihomomorphism whose underlying $C$-morphism is an [[automorphism]].


## Examples

In a $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]] the $*$ operator is an antiautomorphism (in fact an anti-[[involution]]).
