## Idea

The notion of _hopfish algebra_ is a generalization of that of [[Hopf algebra]] designed to behave better with respect to [[Morita equivalence]] of algebras. It is defined to be a [[sesquialgebra]] which is grouplike in a suitable sense.

## Definition

Let $R$ be some [[commutative ring]] (or [[E-infinity ring]]).

###### Definition

A [[sesquiunital sesquialgebra]] over $R$ is an [[associative algebra]] $A$ over $R$ equipped with the structure of an [[algebra object]] internal to the [[2-category]] [[2Mod]] of [[associative algebras]], [[bimodules]] and [[bimodule intertwiners]].

This means that it is an $R$-algebra $A$ equipped with 

* a product $A \otimes_R A$-$A$-[[bimodule]] $\Delta$;

* a unit $R$-$A$-[[bimodule]] $\epsilon$

satisfying the evident [[associative law]] and [[unit law]].

###### Definition

A **preantipode** for a [[sesquiunital sesquialgebra]] $A$ is a left $A \otimes A$-[[module]] $S$ equipped with an [[isomorphism]] of right $A \otimes A$-[[modules]]

$$
  S^* \simeq Hom_A(\epsilon, \Delta)
  \,.
$$

An preantipode is an **antipode** if it is a [[free module]] over $A$ of [[rank]] 1 when regarded as an $A$-$A^{op}$-[[bimodule]].

A sesquiunital sesquialgebra equipped with such an antipode is a **hopfish algebra**.
