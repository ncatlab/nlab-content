## Idea

The notion of _hopfish algebra_ is a generalization of that of [[Hopf algebra]] designed to behave better with respect to [[Morita equivalence]] of algebras. It is defined to be a [[sesquialgebra]] which is grouplike in a suitable sense.

## Definition

Let $R$ be some [[commutative ring]] (or [[E-infinity ring]]).

###### Definition

A [[sesquiunital sesquialgebra]] over $R$ is an [[associative algebra]] $A$ over $R$ equipped with the structure of an [[algebra object]] internal to the [[2-category]] [[2Mod]] of [[associative algebras]], [[bimodules]] and [[bimodule intertwiners]].

This means that it is an $R$-algebra $A$ equipped with 

* a product $A \otimes_R A$-$A$-[[bimodule]] $\Delta$;

* a unit $R$-$A$-[[bimodule]] $\epsilon$

satisfying the evident [[associative law]] and [[unit law]].
