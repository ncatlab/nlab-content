## Free quantum fields
 {#FreeQuantumFields}

We discuss here the [[quantum observables]] for the special case of
[[free field theories]] (def. \ref{FreeFieldTheory}). In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] this is the
basis of the construction of all [[interaction|interacting]] theories in the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]]
of the [[free field theories]].

of a [[finite dimensional vector space]] equipped with [[almost Kähler manifold|almost Kähler structure]]
may be interpreted as "[[normal-ordered product]] for a single mode":

###### Definition
**(almost Kähler vector space)**

An _almost Kähler vector space_ is a [[complex vector space]] $V$ equipped with two [[bilinear forms]] $\sigma, h \;\colon\; V \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that with $V$ regarded as a [[smooth manifold]] and with $\sigma, g$ regarded as constant [[tensors]], then $(V,\sigma,h)$ is an [[almost Kähler manifold]].

###### Example
**(standard almost Kähler vector spaces)**

Let $V \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with the [[complex structure]] given by the canonical identification $\mathbb{R}^2 \simeq \mathbb{C}$, let $\sigma \coloneqq \left( \array{0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0} \right)$ and $h \coloneqq \left( \array{ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1}  \right)$. Then $(V,\sigma,g)$ is an almost Kähler vector space (def. \ref{AlmostKaehlerVectorSpace}).

###### Definition
**(Wick algebra of an almost Kähler vector space)**

Let $(\mathbb{R}^{2n},\sigma, g)$ be an almost Kähler vector space (def. \ref{AlmostKaehlerVectorSpace}). Then its _Wick algebra_ is the [[formal power series]] vector space $\mathbb{C}[ [ a_1, a^\ast_1, \cdots, a_n, a^\ast_n  ] ] [ [ \hbar ] ]$ equipped with the [[star product]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    P_1 \star_\omega P_2
    & \coloneqq
    prod \circ \exp \left( \hbar\underoverset{k_1, k_2 = 1}{2 n}{\sum}\omega^{a b} \partial_a \otimes  \partial_b \right)  (P_1 \otimes P_2)
    \\
    & =
    P_1 \cdot P_2 + \hbar \underoverset{k_1, k_2 = 1}{2n}{\sum}\omega^{k_1 k_2}(\partial_{k_1} P_1) \cdot (\partial_{k_2} P_2)
    + \cdots

$$

given by the bilinear form

$$
  \omega \coloneqq \tfrac{i}{2} \sigma + \tfrac{1}{2} g

Here

   \longrightarrow
   \mathbb{C}[ [ a_1, a^\ast_1, \cdots, a_n, a^\ast_n  ] ] [ [ \hbar ] ]

is the ordinary (commutative) product in the [[formal power series algebra]].

To make contact with the traditional notation we decorate the elements $P$ in the formal power series algebra with colons and declare the notation

$$

  \;\coloneqq\;
  : P_1 \star_\omega P_2 :
$$

+-- {: .num_example #WickAlgebraOfASingleMode}
###### Example
**([[Wick algebra]] of a single mode)**

Let $V \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^2 \simeq Span(\{x,y\})$ be a standard almost Kähler vector space according to example \ref{StandardAlmostKaehlerVectorSpaces}, with canonical coordinates denoted $x$ and $y$. We discuss its Wick algebra according to def. \ref{WickAlgebraOfAlmostKaehlerVectorSpace} and show that this reproduces the traditional definition of products of "normal ordered" operators.

To that end, consider the complex linear combination of the coordinates to the canonical complex coordinates $z \coloneqq x + i y$ and $\overline{z} \coloneqq x - i y$, which we suggestively write instead as

$$
  a \coloneqq \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x + i y)
  \phantom{AAAA}
  a^\ast \coloneqq \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x - i y)
$$

(with "$a$" the traditional symbol for the _amplitude_ of a field mode).

We find the value of the almost-Kähler forms on these elements to be

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \sigma(a,a^\ast)
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2} \sigma( (x + i y), (x - i y) )
    \\
    & =
    \tfrac{-i}{2}( \sigma(x,y) - \sigma(y,x) )
    \\
    & =
    - i
  \end{aligned}
$$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    h(a, a^\ast)
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2} h( (x + i y), (x - i y) )
    \\
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2}(h(x,x) + h(y,y))
    \\
    & =
    1
  \end{aligned}
$$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \sigma(a,a)
    & =
    \sigma(a^\ast, a^\ast)
    \\
    & =
    0
    \phantom{AAAAAA} \text{by anti-symmetry}
  \end{aligned}
$$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    h(a,a)
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2}( h( (x + i y), (x + i y) ) )
    \\
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2}( h(x,x) - h(y,y))
    \\
    & =
    0
  \end{aligned}
$$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    h(a^\ast, a^\ast)
    & =
    \tfrac{1}{2}( h(x,x) - h(y,y) )
    \\
    & = 0
  \end{aligned}
$$

Using this, we find the [[star product]] as follows (where we write $(-)\cdot (-)$ for the plain commutative product in the [[formal power series algebra]]):

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    a \star_\omega a^\ast
    & =
    a \cdot a^\ast
    +
    \tfrac{\hbar}{2}
    \left(
       \underset{= 1}{\underbrace{i \sigma( a, a^\ast )}}
       +
       \underset{= 1}{\underbrace{h(a, a^\ast)}}
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    a^\ast \cdot a + \hbar
    \\
    \\
    a^\ast \star_\omega a
    & =
    a^\ast \cdot a
    +
    \tfrac{\hbar}{2}
    \left(
      \underset{= -1}{\underbrace{i \sigma( a^\ast , a )}}
      +
      \underset{ = 1}{\underbrace{h( a^\ast, a )}}
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    a^\ast \cdot a
    \\
    \\
    a \star_\omega a
     & =
    a \cdot a
    \\
    \\
    a^\ast \star_\omega a^\ast
    & =
    a^\ast \cdot a^\ast
  \end{aligned}
$$

These four cases are sufficient to see that in the star-product $P_1 \star_\omega P_2$ of general elements, we obtain correction term $\hbar$ to the ordinary commutative product precisely for every pair consisting  of a factor of $a$ in $P_1$ and a factor $a^\ast$ in $P_2$. This is exactly the "normal ordering" prescription.

Now to generalize this to the infinite dimensional case of [[free field theory]]:



+-- {: .num_defn #MicrocausalFunctionals}
###### Definition
**([[microcausal functionals]])**

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]].

Write $\mathcal{F}_{mc} \subset \mathcal{F}_{dist}$ for the subalgebra of smooth functionals

$$
  C^\infty(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

on the [[smooth space]] of smooth functions on $X$ which is generated from those [[distributions]] on some Cartesian product $X^n$ whose [[wave front set]] excludes those covectors to a point in $X^n$ all whose components are in the [[future cone]] or all whose components are in the [[past cone]].

=--

(After [[deformation quantization]] below, the [[distributions]] appearing in def. \ref{MicrocausalFunctionals} are the origin of "[[operator-valued distributions]]" in [[perturbative quantum field theory]]).


+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example
**(regular functionals are microcausal)**

Every regular functional is a [[microcausal functional]] (def. \ref{MicrocausalFunctionals}), since the [[wave front set]] of a distribution that is given by an ordinary function is empty:

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{reg} \subset \mathcal{F}_{mc}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
**([[adiabatic switching|adiabtaically switched]] point interactions are microcausal)**

Let $g \in C^\infty_c(X)$ be a [[bump function]], then for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the smooth functional

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty(X) &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \phi &\mapsto& \int_X g(x) (\phi(x))^n dvol(x)
  }
$$

is a [[microcausal functional]] (def. \ref{MicrocausalFunctionals}).

If here we think of $\phi(x)^n$ as a point-[[interaction]] term (as for instance in [[phi^4 theory]]) then $g$ is to be thought of as an "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]" [[coupling constant]]. These are the relevant interaction terms to be quantized via [[causal perturbation theory]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For notational convenience, consider the case $n = 2$, the other cases are directly analogous. The distribution in question is the [[delta distribution]]

$$
  \int_X g(x) \phi(x)^2 dvol(x)
  \;=\;
  \int_{X \times X} g(x_1) \phi(x_1) \phi(x_2) dvol(x_1) dvol(x_2)
  =
  \langle g \cdot \delta(-,-) , (\phi \circ pr_1)\cdot (\phi \circ pr_2)  \rangle_g
  \,.
$$

Now for $(x_1, x_2) \in X \times X$ and $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \simeq U \subset X \times X$ a [[chart]] around this point,  the [[Fourier transform]] of $g \cdot \delta(-,-)$ restricted to this chart is proportional to the Fourier transform $\hat g$ of $g$ evaluated at the sum of the two covectors:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (k_1, k_2)
      & \mapsto
     \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2n}} g(x_1) \delta(x_1, x_2) \exp( k_1 \cdot x_1 + k_2 \cdot x_2 ) dvol(x_1) dvol(x_2)
    \\
    & \propto \hat g(k_1 + k_2)
   \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$


Since $g$ is a plain [[bump function]], its Fourier transform $\hat g$ is quickly decaying (in the sense of wave front sets)  with $k_1 + k_2$ ([this prop.](wavefront+set#EmptyWaveFronSetCorrespondsToOrdinaryFunction)). Thus only on the cone $k_1 + k_2 = 0$ that function is in fact constant and in particular not decaying.

</div>

{#WaveFrontOfdeltaxy} This means that the wave front set consists of the element of the form $(x, (k, -k))$ with $k \neq 0$. Since $k$ and $-k$ are both in the [[future cone]] or both in the past cone precisely if $k = 0$, this situation is excluded in the wave front set and hence the distribution $g \cdot \delta(-,-)$ is microcausal.

This shows that microcausality in this case is related to conservation of momentum in th point interaction.

More generally:



+-- {: .num_prop #MoyalStarProductOnMicrocausal}
###### Proposition
**(Hadamard-Moyal star product on microcausal functionals)**

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]], and let $\omega \in \mathcal{D}'(X \times X)$ be a [[Hadamard distribution]] (def. \ref{HadamardDistribution}) which is guaranteed to exist by prop. \ref{ExistenceOfHadamardDistributions}.

Then the [[star product]]

$$
  P_1 \star_\omega P_2
  \;\coloneqq\;
  prod
   \circ
  \exp\left(
    \int_{X^2} \hbar \omega(x_1, x_2) \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi(x_1)}
    \otimes \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi(x_2)} dvol_g
  \right)
  (P_1 \otimes P_2)
$$

on microcausal functionals $P_1, P_2 \in \mathcal{F}_{mc}$ is well defined in that the [[products of distributions]] that appear in expanding out the [[exponential]] are such that the sum of the [[wave front sets]] of the factors does not intersect the zero section.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of [[Hadamard distribution]], the [[wave front set]] of powers of $\omega$ has all cotangents on the first variables future pointing, and all those on the second variables past pointing. The first variables are integrated against those of $P_1$ and the second against $P_2$. By definition of microcausal functionals, the wave front sets of $P_1$ and $P_2$ are disjoint from the subsets where all components are future pointing or all components are past-pointing. Therefore the relevant sum of of the wave front covectors never vanishes.

###### Definition
**([[Wick algebra]] of [[free quantum field]])**

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] and let $\omega \in \mathcal{D}'(X \times X)$ be a [[Hadamard distribution]] (def. \ref{HadamardDistribution}) which is guaranteed to exist by prop. \ref{ExistenceOfHadamardDistributions}.

Then the _Wick algebra_ of [[quantum observables]] of the [[free field|free]] [[scalar field]] on $(X,g)$ is the space of [[microcausal functionals]] $\mathcal{F}_{mc}$ (def. \ref{MicrocausalFunctionals}) equipped with the Hadamard-Moyal [[star product]] from prop. \ref{MoyalStarProductOnMicrocausal}:

$$

    \mathcal{F}_{mc}, \star_\omega

=--


In [[Minkowski spacetime]] the [[Hadamard state]] is simply the usual [[vacuum state]] $\vert vac \rangle$, hence the [[Hadamard distribution]] is, as a [[generalized function]]

$$
  \omega(x,y) = \langle vac \vert \Phi(x) \Phi(y) \vert vac \rangle
  \,.
$$


Therefore the abstractly defined Wick algebra as in def. \ref{WickAlgebraOfFreeQuantumField} in this case satisfies the relation

$$
  \int_{X} f(x,y)  \;  :\Phi(x): \,  :\Phi(y): \; dvol_g
  \;=\;
  \int_X f(x,y) \left( :\Phi(x) \Phi(y): -  \langle vac \vert \Phi(x) \Phi(y) \vert vac \rangle \right)  \; dvol_g
  \,.
$$

This is the traditional expression for the normal ordered Wick product on Minkowski spacetime (e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_order#Free_fields)).
