## Idea
$\omega$-categorical structures are "highly symmetric" first-order [[structure|structures]].
## Definition
A countable structure $A$ is $\omega$-categorical if any other countable structure $B \models \mathbf{Th}(A)$ with the same [[first-order theory]] as $A$ is isomorphic to $A$.

## Examples
- The [[DLO|countable dense linear orders without endpoints]] are $\omega$-categorical.

- The [[countable random graph]] is $\omega$-categorical.

- Many [[Fraisse limit|Fraisse limits]] are $\omega$-categorical.

- The canonical (orbit) structure induced by an oligomorphic (finitely many orbits in each power) permutation group on a countable set is $\omega$-categorical.



## Remarks
- Conversely, the action $\Aut(A) \curvearrowright A$ is oligomorphic.

- The automorphism group of an $\omega$-categorical structure $A$ equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence comprises a complete set of invariants for $\mathbf{Th}(A)$ up to bi-interpretability: this is the Coquand-Ahlbrandt-Ziegler theorem.
