## Idea

The [[Denis-Charles Cisinski|Cisinski]]--[[Ieke Moerdijk|Moerdijk]] [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] $dSet$ of [[dendroidal set]]s models [[(∞,1)-operad]]s in generalization of the way the [[Andre Joyal|Joyal]] [[model structure on simplicial sets]] models [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].

## Overview


We have the following diagram of [[model category|model categories]]:

$$
  \array{
    SSet\text{-}Operad 
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
    dSet
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
    dSpaces
    &&&&& models\;for\;(\infty,1)\text{-}operads
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    SSet\text{-}Cat 
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
    sSet
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
    sSpaces   
    &&&&&
    models;for\;(\infty,1)\text{-}categories
  }
  \,,
$$

where the entries are

* the category $SSet Cat$ of [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]] equipped with the [[Julie Bergner|Bergner]] model structure;

* the category [[SSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s equipped with the [[model structure on simplicial sets|Joyal model structure]] for [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]];

* the category $dSet$ of [[dendroidal set]]s

and where 

* the horizontal morphisms are [[Quillen equivalence]]s

* the vertical morphisms are [[homotopy full functor|homotopy full]] embeddings.

## Definition


### Special morphisms ###

Recall frrom the entry on [[dendroidal set]]s the definition of inner and outer faces, boundaries and inner and outer horns.

The following definition are the obvious generalizations of the corresponding notions for the [[model structure on simplicial sets]], in particular for the [[Andre Joyal|Joyal]] model structure.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (inner anodyne extension)

The class of morphisms in $dSet$ generated from the inner horn inclusions $\Lambda^e \Omega[T] \to \Omega[T]$ under

* [[pushout]]

* [[transfinite composition]]

* [[retract]]s

is called the **inner anodyne extensions**.

=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (inner Kan fibration)

A [[morphism]] $A \to B$ in $dSet$ is an **inner Kan fibration** if it has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inner horn inclusions.

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^e[T] &\to& A
     \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega[T] &\to& B
  }
$$

or equivalently with respect to the class of inner anodyne extensions.

=--


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (inner Kan complex / quasi-operad)

A dendroidal set $X$ is an **inner Kan complex** or **quasi-operad** if the canonical morphism $X\to {*}$ to the [[terminal object]] is an inner Kan fibration.

=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (trivial fibration)

A morphism $A \to B$ of dendroidal sets is an **acyclic fibration** if it has the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all normal monomorphisms.

=--




### The model structure

A **quasi-operad** is a [[dendroidal set]] such that...

A _trivial fibration of quasi-operads_ is a morphism of [[dendroidal set]]s such that...

###### Definition (model structure on dendroidal sets)

On the category of [[dendroidal set]]s let

* the cofibrations be the normal monomorphisms

* the fibrant objects are the weak Kan complexes/quasi-operads

* the fibrations between fibrant objects are the are the inner Kan fibrations $f : A \to B$ between quasi-operads such that the image $\tau_d(f)$ under the functor $\tau_d : dSet \to Operads$ is an operadic fibration

* the weak equivalences form the smallest class of maps that satisfy

  * [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]]

  * every inner anodyne extension is a weak equivalence

  * every trivial fibration between quasi-operads is a weak equivalence.

###### Theorem

The above choices of cofibrations, fibrations and weak equivalences equips the category $dSet$ of dendroidal sets with the structure of a [[model category]]. This model structure is

* a left [[proper model category]]

* a [[cofibrantly generated model category]]

* a [[combinatorial model category]]

* a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal model category]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is prop. 2.6 in [CisMoe](http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1954).

=--

Together with the fact that $i^*: dSet \to SSet$ is a right Quillen functor (with respect to the Joyal [[model structure on simplicial sets]]) this also imples that $dSet$ is an $SSet_{Joyal}$ [[enriched model category]].

The [[cofibrantly generated model category|generating cofibrations]] $I$ are the boundary inclusion of [[tree]]s

$$
  I = \{\partial \Omega[T] \hookrightarrow \Omega[T]\}
  \,.
$$

A set of generating cofibrations is guaranteed to exist, but no good explicit characterization is known to date.

+-- {: .un_corollary }
###### Corollary

With this model structure and the standard [[model structure on operads]] the dendroidall [[nerve]] [[adjunction]]

$$
  \tau_d : dSet \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Operad : N
$$

is a [[Quillen adjunction]] and both functors preserve all weak equivalences. So in particular a morphism of operads is a weak equivalence precisely if the induced morphism between dendroidal nerves is a weak equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is cor. 6.17 in [CisMoe](http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1954).

=--

+-- {: .un_proposition }
###### Proposition


A morphism $j : X \to Y$ between cofibrant objects in $dSet$ is a weak equivalence precisely if for all fibrant objects $A$ the morphism 

$$
  \tau dSet(Y,A) \to \tau dSet(X,A)
$$

is an [[equivalence of categories]], where $\tau : SSet \to Cat$ is the [[left adjoint]] to the [[nerve]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is in section 8.4 of the lecture notes cited below.

=--


+-- {: .un_proposition }
###### Proposition (compatibility with the Joyal model structure)

Let $|$ be the tree with a single leaf and no vertex. Then the [[overcategory]] $dSet/\Omega[|]$ is canonically isomorphic to [[SSet]].

The model structure on [[SSet]] induced this way as the [[model structure on an overcategory]] from the model structure on $dSet$ coincides with the Joyal [[model structure on simplicial sets]] (the one whose fibrant objects are [[weak Kan complex]]es).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is for instance proposition 8.4.3 in the lecture notes cited below.
