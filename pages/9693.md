
Let $M$ be a [[differentiable manifold]], let $\Del$ be an [[affine connection]] on $M$, and let $p$ be a [[point]] in $M$.  Given a [[tangent vector]] $x$ at $p$, there is are several [[geodesics]] $\gamma$ on $M$ tangent to $x$ at $p$.  Note that $\gamma$ is formally a [[differentiable map]] to $M$ from some [[interval]] ${]a,b[}$, in particular a [[partial function|partial]] differentiable map to $M$ from the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$.  (Here, $a$ is an [[upper real number]] so may be $-\infty$; and $b$ is a [[lower real number]] so may be $\infty$.)

If $\gamma\colon {]a,b[} \to M$ and $\gamma'\colon {]a',b'[} \to M$ are geodesics (on $M$ tangent to $x$ at $p$), then they agree on their common domain ${]max(a,a'),min(b,b')[}$.  Accordingly, If ${]a,b[} \subseteq {]a',b'[}$, then there is at most one extension of $\gamma$ to ${]a',b'[}$ that remains a geodesic.  If $M$ is [[complete manifold|complete]] (and perhaps in any case), then $\gamma$ may be extended (uniquely) to all of $\mathbb{R} = {]-\infty,\infty[}$.  Regardless, there is a unique *[[maximal partial function|maximal]]* geodesic (on $M$ tangent to $x$ at $p$).  This is *the* __maximal geodesic on $M$ tangent to $x$ at $p$__.
