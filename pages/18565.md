## Idea

A [[subset]] of a [[Lorentzian manifold]] is _causally closed_ if it equals the [[causal complement]] of its causal complement.

More generally, the _causal closure_ of any subset is the [[causal complement]] of its causal complement. Hence a subset is causally closed if it equals its causal closure.
