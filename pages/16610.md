[[!redirects Witt-Burnside functors]]
##Idea

Dress and Siebeneicher ([DS88](#DS88)) generalized the [[Witt vector]] construction to the
case of pro-$p$ groups for prime integer $p$. These functors, $W_G$, were originally defined for all profinite groups, $G$, and are now called **Witt-Burnside functors** due to the fact that they generalize both the $p$-typical (recovered when $G = \mathbb{Z}_p$ as an additive group) and 'big' Witt vector construction (recovered when $G = \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$), as well as Burnside functors (recovered as $W_G(\mathbb{Z})$).

Witt-Burnside functors have been used to study equivariant ring spectra as they arise as a left adjoint for [[Tambara functors]].
