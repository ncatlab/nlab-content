[[!redirects Witt-Burnside functors]]
##Idea

Dress and Siebeneicher ([DS88](#DS88)) generalized the [[Witt vector]] construction to the
case that $G$ is a pro-$p$ group for prime integer $p$, $W_G$. These functors were originally defined for all profinite groups and are now called **Witt-Burnside functors** due to the fact that they generalize both the $p$-typical (recovered when $G = \mathbb{Z}_p$ as an additive group) and 'big' Witt vector construction (recovered when $G = \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$), as well as Burnside functors (recovered as $W_G(\mathbb{Z})$).
