## Idea

Given a [[structure]] on some [[space]] $X$ which is equipped with the [[action]] of a [[group]] $G$, then a lift to a _equivariant structure_ is an extension/[[descent]] to the [[action groupoid]] $X//G$. 

## Examples

* [[equivariant bundle]], [[equivariant connection]]

* [[equivariant cohomology]]

## Related concepts
