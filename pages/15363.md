## Idea

A **mixed complex** is both a [[chain complex]] and a [[cochain complex]] in a compatible way.  Equivalently, it is a [[dg-module]] over the [[dg-algebra]] $k[B]/(B^2)$, where $k$ is the base [[ring]], $B$ is of degree $-1$, and $dB = 0$.  Mixed complexes were introduced in the study of [[cyclic homology]].
