## Definition

A **coherent topos** is a [[sheaf topos]] with a [[site]] of definition that is a [[coherent category]] with [[coherent coverage]].

Notice that the terminology is slightly confusing: every topos is a [[coherent category]].


## Examples

* The [[classifying topos]] of a [[coherent theory]] is a coherent topos.
