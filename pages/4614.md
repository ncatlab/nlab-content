## Idea

For $X_\bullet$ a [[simplicial object]] in [[Top]] --  a [[simplicial topological space]] -- its _[[geometric realization]]_ is a plain [[topological space]] $|X_\bullet| \in Top$ obtained by gluing all topological space $X_n$ together, as determined by the face and degeneracy maps.

The construction of $|X_\bullet|$ is a direct analog of the ordinary notion of [[geometric realization]] of a [[simplicial set]], but taking into account the [[topology]] on the spaces of $n$-simplices $X_n$.

## Definition

Let [[Top]] in the following denote the [[category]] 

* of [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weakly Hausdorff space]]s 

* or the category of [[k-space]]s.

Write $\Delta_{Top} : \Delta \to Top : [n] \mapsto \Delta^n_{Top}$ for the standard [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] [[topological space]] of topological [[simplices]].

Write equivalently

$$
  Top^{\Delta^{op}} := sSet := [\Delta^{op}, Top]
$$

for the category of [[simplicial topological space]]s.

+-- {: .num_defn #GeometricRealization}
###### Definition

For $X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ [[simplicial topological space]], its **geometric realization** is the [[coend]]

$$
  |X_\bullet| :  \int^{n \in \Delta} X_n \times \Delta^n_{Top}
$$

formed in [[Top]].

This naturally extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \vert - \vert : sTop \to Top
  \,.
$$

=--

More explicitly, $\vert X_\bullet \vert$ is the [[topological space]] given by the [[quotient]]

$$
  \vert X_\bullet \vert = \coprod_{n} \Delta^n_{Top} \times X_n /\sim
$$

where the [[equivalence relation]] "$\sim$" identifies for every order-preserving [[function]] $[k] \to [l]$ the points $(f_* p,x ) \in \Delta^l_{Top} \times X_l$ and $(p,f^* x) \in \Delta^k_{Top} \times X_k$.

This form of geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces goes back to ([Segal68](#Segal68)). An early reference that realizes this construction as a [[coend]] is ([MacLane](#MacLane)).

One also considers geometric realization after restricting to the subcategory $\Delta_+ \hookrightarrow \Delta$ of the [[simplex category]] on the strictly increasing maps. 

+-- {: .num_defn #FatGeometricRealization}
###### Definition

The corresponding [[coend]] in [[Top]] is called the **fat geometric realization** 

$$
  \Vert X_\bullet\Vert :=  \int^{n \in \Delta_+} X_n \times \Delta^n_{Top}
  \,.
$$

=--

This is called _fat_ ,  because it does not [[quotient]] out the [[relation]]s induced by the degeneracy maps and hence is "bigger" than ordinary geometric realization.

Explicitly, this is the [[topological space]] given by the [[quotient]]

$$
  \Vert X_\bullet \Vert = \coprod_{n} \Delta^n_{Top} \times X_n /{\sim_+}
$$

where the [[equivalence relation]] "$\sim_+$" identifies only for every _strictly increasing_ [[function]] $[k] \to [l]$ the points $(f_* p,x ) \in \Delta^l_{Top} \times X_l$ and $(p,f^* x) \in \Delta^k_{Top} \times X_k$.

+-- {: .num_example #GeometricRealizationOfThePoint}
###### Example

The geometric realization of the point -- the [[simplicial topological space]] that is in each degree the 1-point topological space -- is [[homeomorphic]] to the point, but the fat geometric realization of the point is an "infinite dimensional topological ball": the [[terminal object|terminal]] morphism

$$
  \vert * \vert \stackrel{\simeq_{iso}}{\to} *
$$

is an [[isomorphism]], but the morphism

$$
  \Vert * \Vert \stackrel{\simeq_{wh}}{\to} *
$$

is just a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--

## Reminder on nice simplicial topological spaces

Simplicial topological spaces are in [[homotopy theory]] presentations for certain [[topological ∞-groupoid]]s . In this context what matters is not the operation of geometric realization itself, but its [[derived functor]]. This is obtained by evaluating ordinary geometric realization on "sufficiently nice" [[resolution]]s of simplicial topological spaces. These we discuss now.

Recall the following definitions and facts from [[nice simplicial topological space]].

+-- {: .num_defn #GoodAndProper}
###### Definition 

Let $X : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ be a [[simplicial topological space]].

Such $X$ is called

* **good** if all the degeneracy maps $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n$ are all [[closed cofibration]]s;

* **proper** if the inclusion $s X_n \hookrightarrow X_n$ of the degenerate simplices is a [[closed cofibration]], where $s X_n = \bigcup_i s_i(X_{n-1})$.

Noticing hat the union of degenerate simplices appearing here is a [[Reedy model structure|latching object]] and that closed cofibrations are cofibrations in the [[Strøm model structure]] on [[Top]], the last condition equivalently says: 

* $X_\bullet$ is **proper** if it is cofibrant in the [[Reedy model structure]] $[\Delta^{op}, Top_{Strom}]_{Reedy}$ on [[simplicial object]]s in [[Top]] with respect to the [[Strøm model structure]] on [[Top]].

=--

The notion of good simplicial topological space goes back to ([Segal73](#Segal73)), that of proper simplicial topological space to ([May](#May)). 

+-- {: .num_prop #RelationToDiagonalOfBisimplicialSets}
###### Proposition

A good simplicial topological space is proper:

$$
  (X_\bullet \; good) \Rightarrow (X_\bullet\; proper)
  \,.
$$

=--

A proof appears as ([Lewis, corollary 2.4 (b)](#Lewis)). A generalization of this result is in ([RobertsStevenson](#RobertsStevenson)).

We now discuss the [[resolution]] of any simplicial topological space by a good one.

Write 

$$
  ({\vert- \vert} \dashv Sing) 
   : 
  Top
    \stackrel{\overset{{|-|}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Sing}{\to}} 
  sSet
$$  

for the ordinary [[geometric realization]]/[[singular simplicial complex]] [[adjunction]] (see [[homotopy hypothesis]]).

For $S_{\bullet,\bullet} : \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \to Set$ a [[bisimplicial set]], write $d S$ for its [[diagonal]] $d X : \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \stackrel{S}{\to} Set$.

+-- {: .num_prop #GoodResolution}
###### Proposition

Let $X_\bullet$ be a simplicial topological space. 
Then the simplicial topological space 

$$
  |Sing(X_\bullet)| \in [\Delta^{op}, Top]
$$ 

obtained by applying degreewise $|Sing(-)| : Top \to Top$ is good and hence proper. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Each space $|Sing X_n|$ is a [[CW-complex]], hence in particular a [[locally equi-connected space]]. By ([Lewis, p. 153](#Lewis)) inclusions of [[retract]]s of locally equi-connected spaces are [[closed cofibration]]s, and since degeneracy maps are retracts, this means that the degeneracy maps in $|Sing X_\bullet|$ are closed cofibrations.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


There is a natural morphism

$$
  {|Sing X_\bullet|} \to X_\bullet
$$

that is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]: the degreewise 
$(|-| \dashv Sing)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]].

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #HomeomorphismFromResolutionToDiagonal}
###### Proposition

For $X_\bullet$ any [[simplicial topological space]], there is a [[homeomorphism]] between the geometric realization of the simplicial space $|Sing(X_\bullet)|$ and the ordinary [[geometric realization]] of the [[simplicial set]] that is the diagonal of the [[bisimplicial set]] $Sing(X_\bullet)_\bullet$

$$
  \vert(\vert Sing(X_\bullet) \vert)\vert  \simeq_{iso} | d Sing(X_\bullet)_\bullet | 
  \,.
$$

=--

This follows by results in ([Lewis](#Lewis)).




## Properties


### General

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

We have the following degenerate case of geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces

* If $X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Set \hookrightarrow Top$ is a degreewise [[discrete space]], hence just a [[simplicial set]], the notion of geometric realization above coincides with the notion of [[geometric realization|geometric realization of simplicial sets]].

* If $X_\bulet$ is simplicially constant on a topological space $X_0$, then its geometric realization is [[homeomorphic]] to $X_0$

  $$
    \vert X_\bullet \vert \simeq X_0
    \,.
  $$

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces has a [[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint functor]] $\underline{Sing}$

$$
  (\vert - \vert \dashv \underline{Sing})  :
   sTop
   \stackrel{\overset{\vert - \vert}{\to}}{\underset{\underline{Sing}} {\leftarrow}}
   Top
  \,,
$$

given for $X \in $ [[Top]] a [[topological space]], we have

$$
  \underline{Sing}(X) : [n] \mapsto [\Delta^n_{Top}, X]
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[internal hom]] space from the $n$-simplex to $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every $X \in Top$ there is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  |\underline{Sing}(X)| \to X
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as ([Seymour, prop. 3.1](#Seymour)).



Ordinary geometric realization has the following two disadvantages:


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

* If $X_\bullet$ has in each degree the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]], its realization $\vert X_\bullet \vert$ in general need not.

* If a morphism $f : X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ is degreewise a [[homotopy equivalence]], its geometric realization $\vert f \vert$ need not be a homotopy equivalence.

=--

See ([Segal74, appendix A](#Segal74))

This is different for the fat geometric realization.

+-- {: .num_prop #NicePropertiesOfFatRealization}
###### Proposition

* If $X_\bullet$ is degreewise of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]], then so is $\Vert X_\bullet \Vert$.

* If $f : X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ is degreewise a [[homotopy equivalence]], then also $\Vert f \Vert$ is a homotopy equivalence.

=--

This appears as ([Segal74, prop. A.1](#Segal)).


### Relation between fat and ordinary geometric realization

+-- {: .num_prop #FatRealizationOfGoodSimplicialSpaces}
###### Proposition

If the simplicial topological space $X_\bullet$ is [good](#GoodAndProper) then the natural morphism from its [fat geometric realization](#FatGeometricRealization) to its [ordinary geometric realization](#GeometricRealization) is a [[homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  \Vert X_\bullet \Vert X_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X_\bullet
  \,.
$$

=--

A direct proof of this (not using that good implies proper) appears as ([Segal74, prop. A.1 (iv)](#Segal74)) and a more detailed proof has been given by Tammo tom Dieck.

### Compatibility with limits

We discuss how geometric realization interacts with [[limit]]s of simplicial topological spaces.

#### Ordinary geometric realization

+-- {: .num_prop #RealizationPreservesPullbacks}
###### Proposition

Geometric realization preserves [[pullback]]s: for $X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet \leftarrow Z_\bullet$ a [[diagram]] in $Top^{\Delta^{op}}$ there are [[natural transformation|natural]] [[homeomorphism]]s

$$
  |X_\bullet| \times_{|Y_\bullet|} |Z_\bullet|
  \simeq
  |X_\bullet \times_{Y_\bullet} Z_\bullet|
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears for instance as ([May, corollary 11.6](#May)). See also the proof that geometric realization of simplicial stes preserves pullbacks, at [[geometric realization]].


#### Fat geometric realization

The operation of [fat geometric realization](#FatGeometricRealization) does not preserve [[fiber product]]s on the nose, in general, but it does preserve all [[finite limit]]s up to [[homotopy]]. 

Write $\Vert * \Vert$ for the fat geometric realization of the point. Notice that due to the identification of $sTop$ with its [[overcategory]] over the point (the simplicial topological space constant on the point), $sTop\simeq sTop/*$, we may regard fat geometric gealization as a functor with values in the [[overcategory]] $Top/\Vert*\Vert$ over the 
[fat geometric realization of the point](#GeometricRealizationOfThePoint).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor

$$
  \Vert - \Vert : Top^{\Delta^{op}} \to Top/\Vert*\Vert
$$

preserves all [[finite limit]]s.

=--

See ([GepnerHenriques, remark 2.23](#GepnerHenriques)).


### Relation to the homotopy colimit
  {#RelationToHomotopyColimit}

In certain cases geometric realisation computes the [[homotopy colimit]] of the [[diagram]] $X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Top$ given by the simplicial space, with respect to the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].


+-- {: .num_prop #RealizationOfGoodSimplicialSpacesIsHomotopyColimit}
###### Proposition

Let $X_\bullet$ be a [good](#GoodAndProper) [[simplicial topological space]] that is degreewise a [[CW-complex]]. 

Then in the [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] there is an [[isomorphism]] between its geometric realization and the [[homotopy colimit]] over the simplicial [[diagram]] $X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Top_{Quillen}$ with respect to the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].

$$
  \vert X_\bullet \vert 
  \simeq
  hocolim_n X_n
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have the following zig-zag of [[homotopy equivalence]]s in [[Top]]

$$
  \array{
    \Vert X_\bullet \Vert &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& 
      \Vert (\vert Sing(X_\bullet)\vert) \Vert
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \vert X_\bullet \vert && 
      \vert (\vert Sing(X_\bullet) \vert) \vert
    &=_{iso}&
    \vert  d (Sing X_\bullet)_\bullet \vert 
    &\simeq&
    \vert  hocolim_n (Sing X_n )\vert
  }
  \,.
$$

The two vertical equivalences follows from prop. \ref{FatRealizationOfGoodSimplicialSpaces} by the assumption that $X_\bullet$ is good and the statement of prop. \ref{GoodResolution} that also $\vert Sing X_\bullet \vert$ is good. The top horizontal equivalence is due to prop. \ref{NicePropertiesOfFatRealization} and the fact that the $(\vert-\vert \dashv Sing)$-[[unit of an adjunction|counit]] is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] in general and hence a [[homotopy equivalence]] on CW-complexes.
The homeomorphism on the right is that of prop. \ref{HomeomorphismFromResolutionToDiagonal}. Finally the rightmost equivalence uses that the [[diagonal]] of a bisimplicial set $S_{\bullet, \bullet}$ computes the [[homotopy colimit]] of $[n] \mapsto S_{\bullet, n}$ by 

1. the fact that the diagonal is isomorphic to the coend (see [[bisimplicial set]])

   $$
     d S = \int^{[n] \in \Delta} \Delta[n] \times S_{\bullet,n}
     \,,
   $$

1. this coend is a [[Quillen bifunctor]] (see there)

   $$
     \int^\Delta (-)\times (-) : 
      [\Delta, sSet_{Quillen}]_{Reedy} \times 
      [\Delta^{op}, sSet_{Quillen}]_{Reedy}
      \to
      sSet_{Quillen}
      \,,
   $$

1. the standard cosimplicial simplex $\Delta : \Delta \to sSet$ is a cofibrant [[resolution]] of the point in the [[Reedy model structure]] (see there) and every simplicial simplicial set is Reedy cofibrant;

1. the general discussion of presentations of [[homotopy colimit]]s (see there) by such resolved [[coend]]s.

Finally since $\vert - \vert : sSet_{Quillen} \to Top_{Quillen}$ is a [[Quillen adjunction|left]] [[Quillen equivalence]] (see [[homotopy hypothesis]]) we have

$$
  |hocolim_n Sing X_n| \simeq hocolim_n |Sing X_n| \simeq hocolim_n X_n
  \,.
$$

## Examples and Applications


### Classifying spaces

For $G$ a [[topological group]], write $\mathbf{B}G$ for its [[delooping]] [[topological groupoid]]: the topological groupoid with a single object and $Mor_{\mathbf{B}G}(*,*) := G$, with composition given by the product on $G$.

The [[nerve]] $N \mathbf{B}G$ of this topological groupoid is naturally a [[simplicial topological space]], with

$$
  N \mathbf{B}G : [n] \mapsto G^{\times_n}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The geometric realization of $N \mathbf{B}G$ is a model for the [[classifying space]] $B G$ of $G$-[[principal bundle]]s

$$
  |N \mathbf{B}G| \simeq B G
  \,.
$$

=--

An early reference for this classical fact is ([Segal68](#Segal68)).



### Topological principal $\infty$-bundles
 {#TopologicalPrincipalInfinityBundle}

We discuss aspects of [[principal ∞-bundle]]s equipped with topological [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesion]] and their geometric realization to [[principal bundle]]s in [[Top]].
 

Let $G$ be a [[simplicial topological group]]. 

Recall from the discussion at [[universal principal ∞-bundle]] that $\mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G$ is presented by the morphism of [[simplicial topological space]]s $W G \to \bar W G$. Recall also from [[simplicial topological group]] the following statement.

+-- {: .num_def}
###### Definition

We say a morphism $f : X \to Y$ of [[simplicial topological space]]s is a **global Kan fibration** if for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$ the canonical morphism

$$
  X_n \to Y_n \times_{sTop(\Lambda^n_k, Y)} sTop(\Lambda^n_k, X)
$$

in [[Top]] has a [[section]], where 

* $\Lambda^n_k \in $ [[sSet]] $\hookrightarrow Top^{\Delta^{op}}$ is the $k$th $n$-[[horn]] regarded as a [[discrete space|discrete]] [[simplicial topological space]]:

* $sTop(-,-) : sTop^{op} \times sTop \to Top$ is the [[Top]]-[[hom object]].

We say a [[simplicial topological space]] $X_\bullet \in Top^{\Delta^{op}}$ is **(global) Kan simplicial space** if the unique morphism $X_\bullet \to *$ is a global Kan fibration, hence if for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $0 \leq i \leq n$ the canonical [[continuous function]]

$$
  X_n \to [\Lambda^n_k, X]
$$

into the [[topological space]] of $k$th $n$-[[horn]]s admits a [[section]].

=--

This global notion of Kan simplicial spaces is considered for instance in ([BrownSzczarba](#BrownSzczarba)) and ([May](#May)).

+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialTopologicalUniversalBundle}
###### Proposition

Let $G$ be a [[simplicial topological group]]. Then 

1. $G$ is a globally Kan simplicial topological space;

1. $\bar W G$ is a globally Kan simplicial topological space;

1. $W G \to \bar W G$ is a global Kan fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement appears as ([BrownSzczarba, theorem 3.8](#BrownSzczarba)), the second is noted in ([RobertsStevenson](#RobertsStevenson)), the third appears as ([BrownSzczarba, lemma 6.7](#BrownSzczarba)).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RealizationSimplicialTopologicalUniversalBundle}
###### Proposition

For $G$ well-sectioned, the geometric realization

$$
  \vert W G \vert \to \vert \bar W G \vert
$$

is a global fibration [[resolution]] in $Top_{Quillen}$ of the point inclusion 
$* \to B|G|$.

=--

This is one of the central theorems proven in ([RobertsStevenson](#RobertsStevenson)).

+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialTopolgicalBundleIsGood}
###### Proposition

Let $X_\bullet$ be a [good](#GoodAndProper) [[simplicial topological space]] and $G$ a [[simplicial topological group|well-sectioned simplicial topological group]]. Then for every morphism

$$
  \tau : X \to \bar W G
$$

the corresponding topological [[simplicial principal bundle]] $P$ over $X$ is itself a good simplicial topological space.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The bundle is the [[pullback]] $P = X \times_{\bar W G} W G$ in $sTop$

$$
  \array{
     P &\to& \bar W G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{\tau}{\to}& \bar W G
  }
  \,.
$$

This means that the degeneracy maps of $P_\bullet$ are induced degreewise by morphisms between pullbacks in [[Top]] that are degreewise [[closed cofibration]]s, where one of the morphisms in each pullback is a fibration. By the properties discussed at [[closed cofibration]], this implies that also these degeneracy maps of $P_\bullet$ are closed cofibration.

=--

+-- {: .num_def}
###### Definition


Under the degreewise [[Yoneda embedding]] $sTop \hookrightarrow [Top^{op}, sSet]$ simplicial topological spaces embed into the category of [[simplicial presheaves]] in [[Top]].

We equip this with the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $[Top^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ and we speak of [[homotopy limit]]s in $sTop$ under this embedding.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[homotopy colimit]] operation

$$
  hocolim : sTop \to Top
$$

preserves [[homotopy fiber]]s of morphisms $\tau : X \to \bar W G$ with $X$ good and globally Kan and $G$ well-sectioned.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{SimplicialTopologicalUniversalBundle} we have that $W G \to \bar W G$ is a fibration [[resolution]] of the point inclusion $* \to \bar W G$ in $[Top^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$.

By the general discussion at [[homotopy limit]] this means that the [[homotopy fiber]] of a morphism $\tau : X \to \bar W G$ is computed as the ordinary [[pullback]] $P$ in 

$$
  \array{
    P &\to& W G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\tau}{\to}& \bar W G
  }
$$

(since all objects $X$,  $\bar W G$ and $W G$ are fibrant and at least one of the two morphisms in the pullback diagram is a fibration) and hence

$$
  hofib(\tau) \simeq P
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{SimplicialTopologicalUniversalBundle} and prop. \ref{SimplicialTopolgicalBundleIsGood} we have that all objects here 
are good simplicial topological spaces. Therefore by prop. \ref{RealizationOfGoodSimplicialSpacesIsHomotopyColimit} we have

$$
  hocolim P_\bullet \simeq |P_\bullet|
$$

in [[Ho(Top)]]. By prop. \ref{RealizationPreservesPullbacks} we have that 

$$
  \cdots = |X_\bullet| \times_{|\bar W G|} |W G|
  \,.
$$

But prop. \ref{RealizationSimplicialTopologicalUniversalBundle} says that this is again the presentation of a homotopy pullback/homotopy fiber by an ordinary pullback

$$
  \array{
    |P| &\to& |W G|
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    |X| &\stackrel{\tau}{\to}& |\bar W G|
  }
  \,,
$$

because $|W G| \to |\bar W G|$ is again a fibration resolution of the point inclusion. Therefore


$$
  hocolim P_\bullet \simeq hofib( |\tau| )
  \,.
$$

Finally by prop. \ref{RealizationOfGoodSimplicialSpacesIsHomotopyColimit} and using the assumption that $X$ and $\bar W G$ are both good, this is

$$
  \cdots \simeq hofib (hocolim \tau)
  \,.
$$

In total we have shown

$$
  hocolim (hofib \tau) \simeq hofib (hocolim \tau)
  \,.
$$

A generalization of the statement that good implies proper to other [[topological concrete categories]] and a discussion of the geometric realization of $W G \to \bar W G$ for $G$ a [[simplicial topological group]]  is in 

* [[David Roberts]], [[Danny Stevenson]], _Simplicial principal bundles in parametrized spaces_
{#RobertsStevenson}

Comments on the relation between properness and cofibrancy in the [[Reedy model structure]] on $[\Delta^{op}, Set]$ are made in 

* [[Paul Goerss]], [[Kristen Schemmerhorn]], _Model Categories and Simplicial Methods_ ([arXiv:math.AT/0609537](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0609537)).

The relation between (fat) geometric realization and [[homotopy colimit]]s is considered as prop. 17.5 and example 18.2 of

* [[Daniel Dugger]], _A primer on homotopy colimits_ ([pdf](http://pages.uoregon.edu/ddugger/hocolim.pdf))
{#Dugger}

The (fat) geometric realization of ([[nerve]]s of) [[topological groupoid]]s is discussed in section 2.3 of

* [[David Gepner]], [[André Henriques]], _Homotopy theory of orbispaces_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-muenster.de/sfb/about/publ/heft448.pdf))
