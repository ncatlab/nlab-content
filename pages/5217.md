## Idea

An ordered field is a [[field]] equipped with a compatible [[linear order]].

Note that while the adjective 'ordered' usually refers to a [[partial order]], it is traditionally used more strictly when placed before 'field'.


## Definition

An __ordered field__ is a [[field]] $K$ equipped with a [[linear order]] $\lt$ such that:

*  $1 \gt 0$,
*  If $a, b \gt 0$, then so are $a + b$ and $a b$.

One often sees the definition using a [[total order]] $\leq$ instead of the linear order $\lt$.  This makes no difference in [[classical mathematics]], but we need to use linear orders in [[constructive mathematics]] if we wish to have the usual examples.


## Examples

The field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]] is [[the]] [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]] ordered field.

The field $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]] is a [[subfield]] of $\mathbb{R}$ that is too small to be complete.

The field of [[surreal number]]s is a [[field extension]] of $\mathbb{R}$ that is too large to be complete.


## Properties

Every ordered field must have [[characteristic]] $0$, since we can prove by [[induction]] that $n \gt 0$ for every positive [[natural number]] $n$.

The [[archimedean field|archimedean]] ordered fields are precisely the [[subfield]]s of [[real number|the field of real numbers]].

######Proof
Suppose otherwise: let $a, b \gt 0$ be given, and suppose $b$ is an upper bound of $a, 2a, 3a, \ldots$. Then $b - a$ is an upper bound of $0, a, 2a, \ldots$ and consequently there can be no least upper bound of the sequence, contradicting Dedekind completeness.
