## Idea 

A [[model category]] structure whose fibrant objects are [[Segal categories]]. This is a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[(∞,1)Cat]] from the point of view of (weakly) [[∞Grpd]]-[[enriched categories]].

## Definition

Write $PreSegalCat \hookrightarrow [\Delta^{op}, sSet]$ for the full [[subcategory]] on those bisimplicial sets $X$ for which $X_0$ is a discrete simplicial set (the "precategories").

The [[nerve]] functor 

$$
  N : Cat \to PreSegalCat
$$

has a [[left adjoint]] ("fundamental category" functor)

$$
  \tau_1 : PreSegalCat \to Cat
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

Say a morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $PreSegalCat$ is

* [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] if for all $a,b \in X_0$ the induced morphism

  $$
    X(a,b) \to X(f(a),f(b))
  $$

  is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of simplicial sets;

  * _essentially surjective_ if $\tau_1(f)$ is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]].

  * a _categorical equivalence_ if it is both full and faithful as well as essentially surjective.

=--

There is a completion functor

$$
  compl : PreSegalCat \to PreSegalCat
$$

which [[free construction|freely completes]] a pre-Segal category to a [[Segal category]]. (...)

###### Definition

Say a morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $PreSegalCat$ is

* a cofibration precisely if it is a [[monomorphism]];

* a weak equivalence precisely if its completion $compl(f)$ is a categorical equivalence.

## Properties

### General 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Equipped with the classes of maps defined in def. \ref{CofibrationsAndEquivalences}, $PreSegalCat$ is a [[model category]] which is 

* [[left proper model category|left proper]];

* [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[monoidal model category|monoidal]];

* a [[Cisinski model structure]].

=--

Cartesian closure is shown in ([Pellissier](#Pellissier)). The fact that it is a Cisinski model structure follows from the result in ([Bergner](#Bergner)).
