## Definition

Where a [[probability density function]] (on a [[measure space]]) is a [[real numbers|real]]-valued [[function]] $\rho$ (satisfying certain conditions), a _probability amplitude_ is a [[complex numbers|complex]]-valued function $\psi$ such that its pointwise [[absolute value]] squared

$$
  \rho(x) \coloneqq \psi^\ast(x) \psi(x)
$$

is a probability density.


## Application in physics

Probability amplitudes appear as [[pure states]] of [[quantum mechanical systems]] in the form of _[[wave functions]]_ $\psi$ on the [[phase space]] of a corresponding [[classical system]]. The [[Born rule]] of [[quantum physics]] says  that the probability density $\rho = \psi^\ast \psi$ describes the probability to find the physical system in a given classical state (in a given region of its phase space).

The fact that probability amplitudes are complex-valued means that under addition ("[[superposition]]") they exhibit [[quantum interference]] (the addition of their [[complex phases]]) in stark contrast to the addition of probability densities, for which this cannot happen.

For instance on some [[probability space]] $(X,\mu)$ there are the probability amplitudes $ \exp(i \pi/2) \mu$ and $\exp(-i \pi/2)\mu$ whose associated probability densities are both just $\mu$ itself again. But the sum of these two probability amplitudes vanishes, in contrast to the sum of their associated probability densities. This is known as "destructive" [[quantum interference]].
