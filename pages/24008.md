## Definition

The **Artin-Tate lemma** states that

Given a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[commutative ring]] $A$, a [[commutative algebra|commutative $A$-algebra]] $B$, and a commutative $B$-algebra (and thus a commutative $A$-algebra) $C$, if $C$ is a [[finitely generated algebra]] over $A$ and $C$ is a [[finitely generated module]] over $B$, then $B$ is a finitely generated algebra over $A$. (If $A$ is a commutative subring of commutative ring $B$, then $B$ is a commutative $A$-algebra.)
