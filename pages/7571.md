## Definition

A **closed cover** of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a collection $\{U_i \subset X\}$ of [[closed subsets]] of $X$ whose [[union]] equals $X$: $\cup_i U_i = X$. Usually it is also required that every point $x \in X$ is in the [[interior]] of one of the $U_i$.

## Properties
 {#Properties}

Closed covers can be obtained from [[open covers]] by forming the [[closed subset|closure]] of each of the [[open subsets]]. The result clearly satisfies the clause that every point is in the interior of one of the closed subsets.

### Examples

In [[analytic geometry]], [[affinoid domains]] have [[closed sets]] as [[analytic spectra]] and hence the [[topological space]] underlying a [[Berkovich analytic spaces]] is equipped by a closed cover by affioid domains
