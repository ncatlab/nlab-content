## Idea

In _compactly supported cohomology_ [[cocycles]] and [[coboundaries]] on some [[space]] are required to have [[compact support]]: to be non-trivial only over a [[compact topological space|compact subspace]]/[[compact object|compact subobject]] of the base.

### Compactly supported de Rham cohomology

Discussion of compactly supported [[de Rham cohomology]] includes for instance the following.

A standard textbook account is in 

* [[Raoul Bott]], [[Loring Tu]], _Differential forms in algebraic topology_

A brief account is also in [section 11](#www.few.vu.nl/~vdvorst/DeRham.pdf#page=48) of

* Patrick Hafkenscheid, _De Rham Cohomology of smooth manifolds_ ([pdf](http://www.few.vu.nl/~vdvorst/DeRham.pdf))
