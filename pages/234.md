A **Kapranov--Voevodsky 2-vector space** is a kind of [[2-vector space]], in this case a [[category]] [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to $Vect^n$ for some finite $n$.  For details, see:

Zamolodchikov tetrahedra equations, in _Algebraic Groups and
Their Generalizations: Quantum and Infinite-Dimensional Methods_, _Proc. Sympos. Pure Math._ **56**, Part 2, AMS, Providence, RI, 1994, pp. 177--259.

There is also a more abstract characterization of such categories, described here:
