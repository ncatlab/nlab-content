## Definition

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$ and an $R$-[[associative algebra]] $A$, hence a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $R \longrightarrow A$, the _Amitsur complex_ is the [[Moore complex]] of the dual [[Cech nerve]] of $Spec(A) \to Spec(R)$, hence the [[chain complex]] of the form

$$
  R \to A \to A \otimes_R A \to A \otimes_R A \otimes_R A \to \cdots
$$

with [[differentials]] given by the alternating sum of the coface-maps.

(See also at _[[Sweedler coring]]_, at _[[commutative Hopf algebroid]]_ and at _[[Adams spectral sequence]]_ for the same or similar constructions.)

## Properties

### Descent theorem


+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem
**(descent theorem)**

If $A \to B$ is [[faithfully flat]] then its Amitsur complex is [[exact sequence|exact]].

=--

This is due to ([[Grothendieck]], [[FGA]]1)

The following reproduces the proof in low degree from [Milne, prop. 6.8](#Milne)

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

We show that 

$$
  0 \to A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{1 \otimes id - id \otimes 1}{\longrightarrow} B \otimes_A B
$$ 

is an [[exact sequence]] if $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ is [[faithfully flat]].

First observe that the statement follows if $A \to B$ admits a [[section]] $s \colon B \to A$. Because then we can define a map 

$$
  k \colon B \otimes_A B \longrightarrow B
$$

$$
  k \;\colon\; b_1 \otimes b_2 \mapsto b_1 \cdot f(s(b_2))
  \,.
$$

This is such that applied to a coboundary it yields

$$
  k(1 \otimes b - b \otimes 1) = f(s(b)) - b 
$$

and hence it exhibits every cocycle $b$ as a coboundary $b = f(s(b))$.

So the statement is true for the special morphism 

$$
  B \to B \otimes_A B
$$

$$
  b \mapsto b \otimes 1
$$

because that has a section given by the multiplication map. 

But now observe that the morphism $B \to B \otimes_A B$ is the [[tensor product]] of the morphism $f$ with $B$ over $A$. That $A \to B$ is [[faithfully flat]] by assumption, hence that it exhibits $B$ as a [[faithfully flat module]] over $A$ means by definition that the Amitsur complex for $(A \to B)\otimes_A B$ is exact precisely if that for $A \to B$ is exact.

### As a bar construction 

For $\phi \colon B \longrightarrow A$ a [[homomorphism]]
of suitable [[monoids]], there is the corresponding pull-push [[adjunction]] 
([[extension of scalars]] $\dashv$ [[restriction of scalars]]) on [[categories of modules]]


$$
  ((- )\otimes_B A \dashv \phi^\ast )
  \;\colon\;
   Mod_A
    \stackrel{\overset{(-)\otimes_B A}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\phi^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}
   Mod_B
  \,.
$$

The [[bar construction]] of the corresponding [[monad]] -- the [[higher monadic descent|higher]] [[monadic descent]] objects -- is the corresponding Amitsur complex.

(e.g. [Hess 10, section 6](#Hess10))
