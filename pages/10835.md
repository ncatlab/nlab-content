## Definition

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$ and an $R$-[[associative algebra]] $A$, hence a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $R \longrightarrow A$, the _Amitsur complex_ is the [[Moore complex]] of the dual [[Cech nerve]] of $Spec(A) \to Spec(R)$, hence the [[chain complex]]

$$
  R \to A \to A \otimes_R A \to A \otimes_R A \otimes_R A \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

(See also at _[[Sweedler coring]]_ and at _[[commutative Hopf algebroid]]_ for the same or similar constructions.)

## Properties

### Descent theorem

The _descent theorem_ asserts that
if $R \to A$ is [[faithfully flat]] then its Amitsur complex is [[exact sequence|exact]].
