A __$1$-topos__, or __$(1,1)$-topos__, is simply a [[topos]] in the usual sense of the word.  The prefix $1$- may be added when also discussing higher types of topoi such as 2-topoi, $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topoi|topos]], or even $\infty$-[[infinity-topos|topos]].  Compare that a [[(0,1)-topos]] is a [[Heyting algebra]].

Similarly, a __Grothendieck $1$-topos__, or __Grothendieck $(1,1)$-topos__, is simply a [[Grothendieck topos]].  Compare that a [[Grothendieck (0,1)-topos]] is a [[frame]] (or [[locale]]).

Note that a 1-topos is not exactly a particular sort of 2-topos or $\infty$-topos, just as a Heyting algebra is not a particular sort of 1-topos.  The (1,2)-category of locales (i.e. (0,1)-topoi) embeds fully in the 2-category of Grothendieck 1-topoi by taking sheaves, but a locale is not identical to its topos of sheaves, and in fact no nontrivial 1-topos can be a poset.  Likewise, one expects every Grothendieck 1-topos to give rise to a 2-topos or $\infty$-topos of [[stacks]], hopefully producing a full embedding of some sort.
