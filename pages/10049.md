## Idea

A variant of the scenario of [[cosmic inflation]] in which cosmic inflation is assumed to occur all over the place and repeatedly in localized regions of some large ambient [[spacetime]]. The idea is that each inflating region from the inside looks like one [[big bang]] [[cosmology]].

The idea of eternal cosmic inflation has been argued to provide a possible way to conceptualize the measured values of dimensionles  "physical constants", such as the [[fine structure constant]]: for if in the fundamental [[theory (physics)|theory]] these parameters are not really constants but are dynamical [[field (physics)|fields]] that just happen to have constant value ("moduli fields") over large scales, then they might, so the argument, still vary from one "inflationary bubble" to the next. Thereby the idea of eternal inflation combined with that of a fundamental theory that has moduli fields (such as [[string theory]]) has been argued to put "physical constants" on the same footing as other more or less random phenomenological paraneters, such as for instance the disctance of our planets form the sun, etc.
