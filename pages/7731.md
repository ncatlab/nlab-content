## Idea

### General

Given a [[fiber sequence]] $A \to B \stackrel{f}{\to} C$ of [[classifying spaces]]/[[moduli stacks]] and given a "$B$-structure" in the form of a morphism ([[cocycle]]) $c : X \to B$, then a lift $\hat c$ through $A \to B$ to an "$A$-structure" exists precisely if the induced $C$-structure $f(c) : X \to C$ is trivializable in $C$-[[cohomology]]. One says that $[f(c)]$ it is the **obstruction** to lifting the $B$-structure to an $A$-structure.

### Twisted cohomology

Conversely, by the [[universal property]] of [[fiber sequences]], $A$-cocycles are equivalent to $B$-cocycles whose obstruction class under $f$ is trivial. 

Therefore it makes sense to ask for the [[infinity-groupoid]] of $B$-cocycles whose class under $f$ has some other fixed value $\chi$. This gives $\chi$-_[[twisted cohomology]]_ with coefficients in $A$.
