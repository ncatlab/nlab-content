## Idea

Where a [[string structure]] is a trivialization of a class in [[integral cohomology]], a _differential string structure_ or _geometric string structure_ is the trivialization of this class refined to [[ordinary differential cohomology]]:

the first fractional [[Pontryagin class]] 

$$
  \frac{1}{2} p_1 : B Spin \to B^4 \mathbb{Z}
$$ 

in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]] has a refinement to $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of the form 

$$
  \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 : \mathbf{B}Spin \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
$$ 

-- the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#SmoothFirstFracPontryaginClass">smooth first fractional Pontryagin class</a>.

The induced morphism on [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]]s

$$
  \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1
  :
  \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B} Spin)
  \stackrel{}{\to}
  \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
$$

sends a [[spin group]]-[[principal bundle]] $P$ to its corresponding [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1(P)$.
 
A choice of trivialization of $\frac{1}{2}p_1(P)$ is a [[string structure]]. The [[2-groupoid]] of smooth string structures is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1$ over the trivial [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]].

By [[Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd]] this morphism may be further refined to a [[differential characteristic class]] $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$ that lands in the [[ordinary differential cohomology]] 
$\mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))$, 
classifying [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]]

$$
  \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1
  :
  \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B} Spin)
  \stackrel{}{\to}
  \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
$$

The [[2-groupoid]] of **differential string structures** is the [[homotopy fiber]] of this refinement $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$ over the [[circle n-bundle with connection|trivial circle 3-bundle with trivial connection]] or more generally over the trivial circle 3-bundles with possibly non-trivial connection

Such a differential string structure over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is characterized by a tuple consisting of

1. a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ on a [[Spin group|Spin]]-[[principal bundle]] on $X$;

1. a choice of trivial [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]] with connection $(0, H_3)$, hence a differential 3-form $H_3 \in \Omega^3(X)$;

1. a choice of [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] $\lambda$ of the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] with connection $\frac{1}{2}\hat\mathbf{p}_1(\nabla)$ of $\nabla$ with this chosen 3-bundle

  $$
    \lambda : \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1(\nabla) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    (0,H_3)
    \,.
  $$

More generally, one can consider the [[homotopy fiber]]s of $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$ over arbitrary circle 3-bundles with connection $\hat \mathcal{G}_4 \in \mathbf{H}_{diff}^4(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))$ and hence replace $(0,H_3)$ in the above with $\hat \mathcal{G}_4$. According to the general notion of [[twisted cohomology]], these may be thought of as **twisted differential string structures**, where the class $[\mathcal{G}_4] \in H^4_{diff}(X)$ is the twist.


## Definition 
  {#Definition}

We will assume that the reader is familiar with basics of the discussion at [[Smooth∞Grpd]]. We often write $\mathbf{H} := Smooth \infty Grpd$ for short.

Let $Spin(n) \in $ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] be the [[Spin group]], for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, regarded as a [[Lie group]] and thus canonically as an [[∞-group]] object in [[Smooth∞Grpd]]. We shall notationally suppress the $n$ in the following. Write $\mathbf{B}Spin$ for the [[delooping]] of $Spin$ in [[Smooth∞Grpd]]. (See the discussion <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#LieGroups">here</a>). 
Let moreover $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1) \in Smooth \infty Grpd$ be the <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#CircleLienGroup">circle Lie 3-group</a> and $\mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$ its [[delooping]].

At [[Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd]] the following statement is proven ([FSS](#FSS)).

###### Proposition

The image under [[Lie integration]] of the canonical [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra 3-cocycle]]

$$
  \mu = \langle -,[-,-]\rangle : \mathfrak{so} \to b^2 \mathbb{R}
$$

on the [[semisimple Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}$ of the [[Spin group]] -- the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] -- is a morphism in [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of the form

$$
  \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{p}_1 : 
  \mathbf{B}Spin
    \to
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)

whose image under the <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Euclidean-topological%20infinity-groupoid#GeometricHomotopy">the fundamental ∞-groupoid (∞,1)-functor/ geometric realization</a> $\Pi : Smooth \infty Grpd \to $ [[∞Grpd]] is the ordinary fractional [[Pontryagin class]]

is in [[cohomology]] the corresponding refined [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]]

$$
  [\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1] : 
  H^1_{Smooth}(X,Spin) \to H_{diff}^4(X)

###### Definition

For any $X \in $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]], the [[2-groupoid]]  of **differential string-structures** on $X$ -- $String_{diff}(X)$ -- is the [[homotopy fiber]] of  $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1(X)$ over the trivial differential cocycle.

More generally (see [[twisted cohomology]]) the 2-groupoid of **twisted differential string structures** is the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] $String_{diff,tw}(X)$ in

$$
  \array{
    String_{diff,tw}(X) &\to& H_{diff}^4(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}Spin)
      &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
  }
  \,,
$$

where the right vertical morphism is a choice of (any) one point in each [[connected component]] (differential cohomology class) of the [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]] $\mathbf{H}_{diff}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))$ (the [[homotopy type]] of the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] is independent of this choice).

More specifically, a **geometric string structure** is a twisted differential string structure whose differential twist has underlying trivial class.

In terms of local [[∞-Lie algebra valued differential forms]] data this has been considered in ([SSSIII](#SSSIII)), as we shall discuss [below](#ChernWeilTheory).

For the case where the the underlying integral class of the twist is trivial -- geometric string structures -- something close to this definition, explicitly modeled on [[bundle 2-gerbe]]s, has been given in ([Waldorf](#Waldorf)). See the discussion [below](#Properties).

+-- {: .num_prop #GroupoidOfStringStructures}
###### Observation

The [[∞-groupoid]] $String_{tw,diff}(X)$ of twisted differential string structures is [[2-truncated]], hence is a [[2-groupoid]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows from the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] associated to the defining [[(∞,1)-pullback]], using that

* $\mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))$ is a [[3-groupoid]];

* $\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}Spin)$ is a [[1-groupoid]];

* $H^4_{diff}(X)$ is a [[0-groupoid]].

=--

See also ([Waldorf, cor. 1.1.5](#Waldorf)).

+-- {: .num_prop #PropertiesOfTrivialIntegralTwistClass}
###### Observation

If the underlying [[integral cohomology]] class of the twist is trivial, $c(tw) = 0 \in H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, then a $tw$-twisted differential string structures on a $Spin$-[[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ are characterized by a globally defined 3-form on $X$.

=--

This 3-form is the globally defined connection 3-form of an appropriate [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]] equivalent to the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] $CS(\nabla)$ whose underlying 3-bundle is by assumption trivial: on a trivial circle $n$-bundle every connection may be represented by a globally defined $n$-form.

This statement appears as ([Waldorf, theorem 1.3.3](#Waldorf)), where circle 3-bundles are modeled as [[bundle 2-gerbe]]s. The explicit construction of the globally defined 3-form in this model is spelled out in lemma 3.2.4 there.


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Elements in the defining [[homotopy pullback]] from def. \ref{DifferentialStringStructure} over a given [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla \in \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B} Spin)_{conn}$ are chracterized by an element $[\alpha] \in H^4_{diff}(X)$ and an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]]

$$
  \Omega : CS(\nabla) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \alpha
$$

between the corresponding [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] and the given [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]] $\alpha$. In the case at hand, both have underlying trivial class $c(CS(\nabla)) = c(\alpha) = 0$.

By the [characteristic class exact sequence](http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/ordinary%20differential%20cohomology#AbstractProperties)

$$
  0 \to \Omega^3(X)/\Omega_{int}^{3}(X)
  \to 
   H^4_{diff}(X) \stackrel{c}{\to} H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})
$$

any two classes in $\pi_0 \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)) \simeq H^4_{diff}(X)$ that have trivial underlying class in $\pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)) \simeq H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$ differ by a 3-form modulo a closed 3-form with integral periods.

Therefore both $[\alpha]$ as well as $[CS(\nabla)] \in H^4_{diff}(X)$ are given by a globally defined 3-form modulo an integral form: the global connection 3-form on these trivial [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]].

### Construction in terms of $L_\infty$-Cech cocycles 
  {#ChernWeilTheory}

We use the [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] (as described there) by the local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc}$ to give an explicit construction of twisted differential string structures in terms of [[Cech cohomology|Cech]]-cocycles with coefficients in [[∞-Lie algebra valued differential forms]].

Proofs not displayed here can be found at _[[differential string structure -- proofs]]_ .

Recall the following fact from [[Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd]] ([FSS](#FSS)).

+-- {: .num_prop #LieIntegrationOfDifferentialPOne}
###### Proposition

The differential fractional Pontryagin class $\frac{1}{2} \hat \mathbf{p}_1$ is presented in $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ by the top morphism of simplicial presheaves in

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(\mathfrak{so})_{ChW,smp}
     &\stackrel{\exp(\mu, cs)}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_{ChW,smp}     
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(\mathfrak{so})_{diff,smp}
     &\stackrel{\exp(\mu, cs)}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_{smp} 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}Spin_{c}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

Here the middle morphism is the direct [[Lie integration]] of the [[infinity-Lie algebra cohomology|L-∞ algebra cocycle]] while the top morphisms is its restriction to coefficients for [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]].

In order to compute the [[homotopy fiber]]s of 
$\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1$ we now find a [[resolution]] of this morphism $\exp(\mu,cs)$ by a fibration in $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$. By the fact that this is a [[simplicial model category]] then also the hom of any cofibrant object into this morphism, computing the cocycle $\infty$-groupoids, is a fibration, and therefore, by the general discussion at [[homotopy pullback]], we obtain the [[homotopy fiber]]s as the ordinary [[fiber]]s of this fibration.


#### Presentation of the differential class by a fibration
 {#PresentationOfClassByFibration}

In order to factor $\exp(\mu,cs)$ into a weak equivalence followed by a fibration, we start by considering such a factorization before differential refinement, on the underlying characteristic class $\exp(\mu)$.

To that end, we replace the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{so}$ by an equivalent but bigger [[∞-Lie algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] (following [SSSIII](#SSSIII)). We need the following notation:

* $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{so}$, the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] (the Lie algebra of the [[spin group]]);

* $b^2 \mathbb{R}$ the [[line Lie n-algebra|line Lie 3-algebra]], the single generator in degee 3 of its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] we denote $c \in CE(b^2 \mathbb{R})$, $d c = 0$.

* $\langle -,-\rangle \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ is the [[Killing form]] [[invariant polynomial]], regarded as an element of the [[Weil algebra]] of $\mathfrak{so}$;

* $\mu := \langle -,[-,-]\rangle \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$ the degree 3 [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycle]], identified with a morphism

  $$
    CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow CE(b^2 \mathbb{R}) : \mu
  $$

  of [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s; and normalized such that its continuation to a 3-form on $Spin$ is the image in 
[[de Rham cohomology]] of $Spin$ of a generator of $H^3(Spin,\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$;

* $cs \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ is a [[Chern-Simons element]] interpolating between the two; characterized by the fact that it fits into the commuting diagram

  $$
    \array{
       CE(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}&
       CE(b^2 \mathbb{R})
       \\
       \uparrow && \uparrow
       \\
       W(\mathfrak{g})
       &\stackrel{cs}{\leftarrow}&
       W(b^2 \mathbb{R})
       \\
       \uparrow && \uparrow
       \\
       inv(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\langle-,-\rangle}{\leftarrow}&
       inv(b^2 \mathbb{R})
       & = CE(b^3 \mathbb{R})
    }
  $$

* $\mathfrak{g}_\mu := \mathfrak{string}$ the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].



+-- {: .num_defn #ResolutionOfLieAlgebra }
###### Definition

Let $(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ denote the 
[[L-∞ algebra]] whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is

$$
  CE(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu) = 
  (\wedge^\bullet(  \mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \langle b\rangle \oplus \langle c \rangle ), d)
  \,,
$$

with $b$ a generator in degree 2, and $c$ a generator in degree 3, and with differential defined on generators by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} & = [-,-]^*
    \\
    d  b & = - \mu + c
    \\
    d c & =  0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #FactorizationOfTheCocycle}
###### Proposition

The 3-cocycle $ CE(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow} CE(b^2 \mathbb{R})$ factors as 

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
   \stackrel{(c \mapsto \mu, b \mapsto 0)}{\leftarrow}
  CE(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)
   \stackrel{(c \mapsto c)}{\leftarrow}
  CE(b^2 \mathbb{R})
  :
  \mu
  \,,
$$

where the morphism on the left (which is the identity when restricted to $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and acts on the new generators as indicated) is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

=--

The point of introducing the resolution $(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ in the above way is that it naturally supports the obstruction theory of lifts from $\mathfrak{g}$-[[connection on a bundle|connections]] to [[string Lie 2-algebra]] [[connection on an infinity-bundle|2-connection]] 

+-- {: .num_prop #LongFiberSequenceOnLieAlgebras}
###### Observation

The defining projection $\mathfrak{g}_\mu \to \mathfrak{g}$
factors through the above quasi-isomorphism $(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu) \to \mathfrak{g}$ by the canonical inclusion

$$
  \mathfrak{g}_\mu \to (b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)
  \,,
$$

which dually on $CE$-algebras is given by 

$$
  t^a \mapsto t^a
$$

$$
  b \mapsto - b
$$

$$
  c \mapsto 0
  \,.
$$

In total we are looking at a convenient presentation of the long [[fiber sequence]] of the [[string Lie 2-algebra]] extension:

$$
  \array{   
    && && (b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu) &\to& b^2 \mathbb{R}
    \\
    && & \nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    b \mathbb{R} &\to& \mathfrak{g}_\mu &\to& \mathfrak{g}
  }
  \,.
$$

(The signs appearing here are just unimportant convention made in order for some of the formulas below to come out nice.)


+-- {: .num_prop #BareFibration}
###### Proposition

The image under [[Lie integration]] of the above factorization is

$$
  \exp(\mu) 
  :
   \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(\mathfrak{g})
   \to 
   \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)
   \to 
   \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_c
$$

where the first morphism is a weak equivalence followed by a fibration in the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that the left morphism is objectwise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], notice that 
a $[k]$-cell of $\exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ consists of a triple $(A,B,C)$, where $A$ is a vertical flat $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on $U\times\Delta^k$, $B$ is a vertical 2-form and $C$ a 3-form on $U\times\Delta^k$, such that $d B=C-\mu(A,A,A)$ and $d C=0$, since $A$ is flat. Therefore $C$ is uniquely determined by $A$ and $B$, and there are no conditions on $B$. This means that  a $[k]$-cell of $\exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ is identified with a pair consisting of a based [[smooth function]] $f : \Delta^k \to Spin$ and a [[vertical differential form|vertical 2-form]] $B \in \Omega^2_{si,vert}(U \times \Delta^k)$, (both suitably with sitting instants perpendicular to the boundary of the simplex). Since there is no further condition on the 2-form, it can always be extended from the boundary of the $k$-simplex to the interior (for instance simply by radially rescaling it smoothly to 0). Accordingly the [[simplicial homotopy group]]s of $\exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)(U)$ are the same as those of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})(U)$. The morphism between them is the identity in $f$ and picks $B = 0$ and is hence clearly an isomorphism on homotopy groups. 

We turn now to discussing that the second morphism is a fibration. The nontrivial degrees of the lifting problem

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda[k]_i 
     &\to&
     \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)(U)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[k] &\to& \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_c(U)
  }
$$

are $k = 3$ and $k = 4$.

Notice that a $3$-cell of $\mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/ \mathbb{Z}_c(U)$ is a [[smooth function]] $U \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ and 
that the morphism $\exp(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu) \to \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_c$ sends the pair $(f,B)$ to the [[fiber integration]] $\int_{\Delta^3}(f^* \langle \theta \wedge [\theta \wedge \theta]\rangle + d B) mod \mathbb{Z}$. 

Our lifting problem in degree 3,
has given a function $c : U \times \Delta^3 \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ and a smooth function (with sitting instants at the subfaces) $f : U \times \Lambda^3_i \to Spin$ together with a 2-form $B$ on the [[horn]] $U \times \Lambda^3_i$.

By pullback along the standard [[continuous function|continuous]] [[retract]] $\Delta^3 \to \Lambda^3_i$ which is non-smooth only where $f$ has sitting instants,  we can always extend $f$ to a smooth function $f' : U \times \Delta^3 \to Spin$ with the property that $\int_{\Delta^3} (f')^* \langle \theta \wedge [\theta \wedge \theta]\rangle = 0$. (Following the general discussion at [[Lie integration]].)

In order to find a horn filler for the 2-form component, consider any smooth 2-form with sitting instants and non-vanishing integeral on $\Delta^2$, regarded as the missing face of the [[horn]]. By multiplying it with a suitable smooth function on $U$ we can obtain an extension $\tilde B \in \Omega^3_{si,vert}(U \times \partial \Delta^3)$ of $B$ to all of $U \times \partial \Delta^3$ with the property that its integral over $\partial \Delta^3$ is the given $c$. By the [[Stokes theorem]] it remains to extend $\tilde B$ to the interior of $\Delta^3$ in any way, as long as it is smooth and has sitting instants.

To that end, we can find in a similar fashion a smooth $U$-parameterized family of closed 3-forms $H$ with sitting instants on $\Delta^3$, whose integral over $\Delta^3$ equals $c$. Since by sitting instants this 3-form vanishes in a neighbourhood of the boundary, the standard formula for the [[Poincare lemma]] applied to it produces a 2-form $B' \in \Omega^2_{si, vert}(U \times \Delta^3)$ with $d B' = C$ that itself is radially constant at the boundary. By construction the difference $\tilde B - B'|_{\partial \Delta^3}$ has vanishing surface integral. By the discussion at [[Lie integration]] it follows that the difference extends smoothly and with sitting instants to a closed 2-form $\hat B \in \Omega^2_{si,vert}(U \times \Delta^3)$. Therefore the sum 

$$
  B' + \hat B \in \Omega^2_{si,vert}(U \times \Delta^3)
$$

equals $B$ when restricted to $\Lambda^k_i$ and has the property that its integral over $\Delta^3$ equals $c$.
Together with our extension $f'$, this constitutes a pair that solves the lifting problem.

The extension problem in degree 4 amounts to a similar construction: by coskeletalness the condition is that for a given $c : U \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ and a given vertical 2-form on $U \times \partial \Delta^3$ such that its integral equals $c$, as well as a function $f : U \times \partial \Delta^3 \to Spin$, we can extend the 2-form and the function along $U \times \partial \Delta^3 \to U \times \Delta^3$. The latter follows from the fact that $\pi_2 Spin = 0$ which guarantees a continuous filler (with sitting instants), and using the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]] to make this smooth. We are left with the problem of extending the 2-form, which is the same problem we discussed above after the choice of $\tilde B$.

=--

We now proceed to extend this factorization to the exponentiated differential coefficients (see [[connection on an ∞-bundle]]).

of $\exp(\mu,cs)$ in $[CartSp^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$, where the first morphism is a weak equivalence and the second a fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The following proof makes use of details discussed at _[[differential string structure -- proofs]]_ .

We discuss that the first morphism is an equivalence. Clearly it is injective on homotopy groups: if a sphere of $A$-data cannot be filled, then also adding the $(B,C)$-data does not yield a filler. So we need to check that it is also surjective on homotopy groups: if the $A$-data can be filled, then also the corresponding $(B,C)$-data has a filler. Since the curvature $H$ is horizontal it is already extended. We may extend $B$ in any smooth way to $U \times \Delta^k$ (for instance by rescaling it smoothly to zero at the center of the $k$-simplex) and then take the equation $d B = - CS(A) + C + H$ to define the extension of $C$. 

We now check that the second morphism is a fibration. It is itself the composite

$$
  \mathbf{cosk}_{3} \exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)_{ChW}
  \to 
  \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R})_{ChW}/\mathbb{Z}
  \stackrel{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_{ChW,ch}
  \,.
$$

Here the second morphism is a degreewise surjection of simplicial abelian groups, hence a degreewise surjection under the [[normalized chain complex]] functor, hence is itself already a projective fibration. Therefore it is sufficient to show that the first morphism here is a fibration.

In degree $k = 0$ to $k = 3$ the lifting problems

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda[k]_i 
       &\to & 
      \exp(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_{\mu})_{smp,ChW}(U)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      \Delta[k] 
        &\to&
      \exp(b^2 \mathbb{R})_{smp,ChW}/\mathbb{Z}(U)
  }
$$

may all be equivalently reformulated as lifting against a [[cylinder]] $D^k \hookrightarrow D^k \times [0,1]$ by using the sitting instants of all forms.

We have then a 3-form $C \in \Omega^3_{si}(U \times D^{k-1}\times [0,1])$ with horizontal curvature $\mathcal{G} \in \Omega^4(U)$ and differential form data $(A,B)$ on $U \times D^{k-1}$ given. We may always extend $A$ along the cylinder direction $[0,1]$ (its vertical part is equivalently a based smooth function to $Spin$ which we may extend constantly). $H$  has to be horizontal so it is to be constantly extended along the cylinder.

We can then use the kind of formula that proves the [[Poincare lemma]] to extend $B$. Let $\Psi : (D^k \times [0,1]) \times [0,1] \to (D^k  \times [0,1])$ be a smooth contraction. Then while $d(H - CS(A) + C)$ may be non-vanishing, by horizonatlity of their [[curvature characteristic form]]s we still have that $\iota_{\partial_t} \Psi_t^* d(H - CS(A) + C)$ vanishes (since the contraction vanishes).

Therefore the 2-form

$$
  \tilde B := \int_{[0,1]} \iota_{\partial_t} \Psi_t^*(H - CS(A) + C)
$$

satisfies $d \tilde B = (H - CS(A) + C)$. It may however not coincide with our given $B$ at $t = 0$. But the difference $B - \tilde B|_{t = 0}$ is a closed form on the left boundary of the cylinder. We may find some closed 2-form on the other boundary such that the integral around the boundary vanishes. Then the argument from the proof of the [[Lie integration]] of the [[line Lie n-algebra]] applies and we find an extension $\lambda$ to a closed 2-form on the interior. The sum

$$
  \hat B := \tilde B + \lambda
$$

then still satisfies $d \hat B = H - CS(A) - C$ and it coincides with $B$ on the left boundary.

Notice that here $\tilde B$ indeed has sitting instants: since $H$, $CS(A)$ and $C$ have sitting instants they are constant on their value at the boundary in a neighbourhood perpendicular to the boundary, which means for these 3-forms in the degrees $\leq 3$ that they _vanish_ in a neighbourhood of the boundary, hence that the above integral is towards the boundary over a vanishing integrand.

In degree 4 the nature of the lifting problem 

$$
  \array{
  \Lambda[4]_i &\to& \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(b\mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)(U)
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  \Delta[4] &\to& \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}_{ChW,ch}
  }
$$

starts out differently, due to the presence of $\mathbf{cosk}_3$, but it then ends up amounting to the same kind of argument:

We have four functions $U \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which we may realize as the [[fiber integration]] of a 3-form $C$ on $U \times (\partial \Delta[4] \setminus \delta_i \Delta[3])$,
and we have a lift to $(A,B,C, H)$-data on $U \times (\partial \Delta[4]\setminus \delta_i(\Delta[3]))$ (the boundary of the 4-simplex minus one of its 3-simplex faces). 

We observe that we can 

* always extend $C$ smoothly to the remaining 3-face such that its [[fiber integration]] there reproduces the signed difference of the four given functions corresponding to the other faces (choose any smooth 3-form with sitting instants and with non-vanishing integral and rescale smoothly);

* fill the $A$-data horizonatlly due to the fact that $\pi_2 (Spin) = 0$. 

* the $H$-form is already horizontal, hence already filled. 

Moreover, by the fact that the 2-form $B$ already is defined on all of $\partial \Delta[4] \setminus \delta_i(\Delta[3])$ its fiber integral over the boundary $\partial \Delta[3]$ coincides with the fiber integral of $H - CS(A) + C$ over $\partial \Delta[4] \setminus \delta_i (\Delta[3])$). But by the fact that we have lifted $C$ and the fact that $\mu(A_{vert}) = CS(A)|_{\Delta^3}$ is an integral cocycle, it follows that this equals the fiber integral of $C - CS(A)$ over the remaining face.

Use then as above the vertical Poincare lemma-formula to find $\tilde B$ on $U \times \Delta^3$ with sitting instants that satisfies the equation 
$d B = H - CS(A) + C$ there. Then extend the closed difference $B - \tilde B|_{0}$ to a closed smooth 2-form on $\Delta^3$. As before, the difference

$$
  \hat B := \tilde B  + \lambda
$$

is an extension of $B$ that constitutes a lift.

For any $X \in $ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]], for any choice of differentiaby [[good open cover]] with corresponding cofibrant presentation $\hat X = C(\{C_i\})\in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ we have that the [[2-groupoid]]s of [twisted different String structures](#DifferentialStringStructure)s are presented by the ordinary [[fiber]]s of the morphism of [[Kan complex]]es

$[\hat \mathbf{C}_3] \in H_{diff}^4(X)$ in the [[ordinary differential cohomology]]  of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$ is a [[simplicial model category]] the morphism 
$[CartSp^{op}, sSet](\hat X,\exp(\mu,cs))$ 
is a fibration because $\exp(\mu,cs)$ is and $\hat X$ is cofibrant.

It follows from the discussion at [[homotopy pullback]] that the ordinary [[pullback]] of [[simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  \array{
    String_{diff,tw}(X) &\to& H_{diff}^4(X)

We unwind the explicit expression for a twisted differential string structure under this equivalence.

### Differential string structures and fermionic string quantum anomalies

The [[Pfaffian line bundle]] controlling the [[fermionic path integral]] of the [[heterotic superstring]] propagating on target $X$ trivializes precisely if the target has a (geometric) string structure.


One shows that the [[Pfaffian line bundle]] on the worldsheet is [[isomorphic]] as a bundle with connection with the [[transgression]] of the differential string structure on the target space to the mapping space $[\Sigma,X]$. So the target space having a (differential) string structure is a sufficient condition for the cancellation of the [[quantum anomaly]].

(First argued in [Killingback](#Killingback), later made precise in ([Bunke](#Bunke))).


### The Green-Schwarz mechanism in heterotic supergravity
 {#InheteroticSugra}

We discuss the application of twisted differential string structures in [[supergravity]] and [[string theory]].

Local differential form data as in note \ref{UnwindingTheLocalData} above is known in [[higher category theory and physics|theoretical physics]] in the context of the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] for 10-dimensional [[supergravity]].

In this context 

* $\omega$ is called the [[spin connection]]; 

* the components $((H_3)_i, \cdots)$ of the above cocycle are known as the $\hat \mathcal{G}_4$-twisted [[Kalb-Ramond field]].

In this application the twisting cocycle $\hat \mathcal{G}_4 \in H^4_{diff}(X)$ is itself the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] of a [[unitary group]]-[[principal bundle]] with local connection form $A \in \Omega^1(U, \mathfrak{u})$. Therefore in this case $C_3 = CS(A)$ and the above local form data becomes

$$
  H_3 = d B + CS(\omega) - CS(A)
$$

$$
  d H_3 = \langle F_\omega \wedge F_\omega \rangle
   - 
   \langle F_A \wedge F_A \rangle
  \,.
$$

Since $H_3$ is the would-be [[curvature]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]], this is the first higher [[Maxwell equation]] that exhibits 

$$
  j_{mag}
  :=
  \langle F_\omega \wedge F_\omega \rangle
   - 
   \langle F_A \wedge F_A \rangle
$$

as the [[magnetic charge]] distribution that twists this 2-bundle. This may be interpreted as the magnetic charge density of a classical background density of magnetic [[fundamental brane|fivebranes]].  For more details on this see [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]].

More precisely, the twisted differential string structure of the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] in heterotic [[supergravity]] for fixed gauge bundles are therefore given by the [[(∞,1)-pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    GSBackground_{fixed gauge bundle}(X) &\to& \pi_0 \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X, \mathbf{B}U)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\hat \mathbf{c}_2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}Spin)
     &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}_{dR}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
  }
  \,.
$$

Clearly, if we take into account also gauge transformations of the gauge bundle, we should replace this by the full

$$
  \array{
    GSBackground(X) &\to& \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X, \mathbf{B}U)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\hat \mathbf{c}_2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}Spin)
     &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}_{dR}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
  }
  \,.
$$


The look of this diagram makes manifest how in this situation we are looking at the structures that homotopically cancel the differential classes $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}$ and $\hat \mathbf{c}_2$ against each other.

More discussion of this is in ([SSSIII](#SSSIII)).


Since $\mathbf{H}_{dR}(X, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1))$ is abelian, we may consider the corresponding <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fiber%20sequence#MayerVietoris">Mayer-Vietoris</a> sequence by realizing $GSBackground(X)$ equivalently as the [[homotopy fiber]] of the difference of differential cocycles $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1 - \hat \mathbf{c}_2$.

$$
  \array{
    GSBackground(X) &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}Spin \times \mathbf{B}U)
     &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1-\hat \mathbf{c}_2}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}_{dR}(X, \mathbf{B}^4 U(1))
  }
  \,.
$$
  
Indeed, the above explicit presentation by simplicial presheaves generalizes immediately to describe this case, realizing $U$-twisted differential string structures equivalently as differential "untwisted $U$-twisted-string-structures".

We may usefully formalize this further by defining the $String^{\mathbf{c}_2}$-2-group to be the homotopy fiber

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} String^{\mathbf{c}_2} &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{G}(Spin \times U)
    &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{c}_2}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

We have then that $GSBackground(X)$ is the 3-groupoid of _untwisted_
differential $\mathbf{B}String^{\mathbf{c}_2}$-structures.

$$
  \array{
    GSBackground(X) &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{0}
    \\ 
    \mathbf{H}_{conn}(\mathbf{B} (Spin \times U))
    &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{c}_2}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}_{dR}(X, \mathbf{B}^4 U(1))
  }
  \,.
$$

More on this in ([FiSaSc](#FiSaSc)).

This is supposed to be (see section 12 of ([DFM](#DFM))) the restriction to the boundary of the [[supergravity C-field]], which is the $(\infty,1)$-pullback

$$
  \array{
    C Field(Y) &\to& H^4_{dR}(Y)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d C_3}}
    \\ 
    \mathbf{H}(Y,\mathbf{B} (Spin \times U))
    &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{c}_2}{\to}&
    \mathbf{H}(Y, \mathbf{B}^4 U(1))
  }
  \,.
$$

where $Y$ is 11-dimensional with $\parital Y = X$. Notice that here in the bottom left we have bundles _without_ connection, or equivalently (when computing the [[homotopy pullback]] by an ordinary pullback along a fibration)  with [[pseudo-connection]]s. 

By the discussion at [[supergravity C-field]] under a shift of connection $\nabla_1 \mapsto \nabla_2$ the $C$-field transforms as 

$$
  C_2 = C_1 + CS(\nabla_1, \nabla_2)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the relative [[Chern-Simons form]]. This vanishes precisely on the genuine gauge transformations. Hence as we restrict from  11-dimensions to 10, two things happen:

1. the supergravity $C$-field vanishes,

1. the gauge bundles develop genuine connections.




### Relation to string 2-connections

By the discussion at _[[connection on an ∞-bundle]]_ we have that for $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[L-∞ algebra]] and 

$$
  \mathbf{B}G := \mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(\mathfrak{g})
$$

the [[delooping]] of the [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth Lie n-group]] obtained from it by [[Lie integration]], the coefficient for [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]] on $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]]s is 

$$  
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn} := \mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
  \,,
$$

where on the very right we have the [[simplicial presheaf]]

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g}) : (U,[k]) \mapsto
   \left\{
     A : CE(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^n)
     |
     A\;is\;vertically\;flat\; and\;F_A\;is \; horizontal
   \right\}
   \,.
$$

(See [[∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism]] for details).

###### Proposition

The [[2-groupoid]] of entirely untwisted differential string structures on $X$ (the twist being $0 \in H^4_{diff}(X)$) is equivalent to that of [[string 2-group]] [[principal 2-bundle]]s with [[connection on an ∞-bundle|2-connection]]:

$$
  String_{diff, tw = 0}(X) \simeq String 2Bund_{\nabla}(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the above discussion of [Cech cocycles](#ExplicitCocycles) we compute $String_{diff, tw = 0}(X)$ as the ordinary fiber of the morphism of simplicial presheaves

$$
  [CartSp^{op}, sSet](
  C(\{U_i\}),  \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu))
  \to 
  [CartSp^{op}, sSet](
  C(\{U_i\}), \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{diff})
$$

over the identically vanishing cocycle.

In terms of the component formulas spelled out in the [above discussion](#InheteroticSugra) of the GS-mechanism, this amounts to restricting to those cocyles for which n each degree the equations

$$
  C = 0
$$

$$
  G = 0
$$

holds. 

Comparing this to the explicit formulas for $\exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ and $\exp(b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)_{conn}$ in the [above](#PresentationOfClassByFibration) we see that these cocycles are exactly those that factor through the canonical inclusion

$$
  \mathfrak{g}_\mu \to (b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu)
$$

from observation \ref{LongFiberSequenceOnLieAlgebras} of the [[string Lie 2-algebra]] into the [[mapping cone]] Lie 3-algebra of the extension $b \mathbb{R} \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu \to \mathfrak{g}$ that defines it.
