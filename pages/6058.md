This entry is about the article

* [[Alexander Kahle]], [[Alessandro Valentino]], _T-duality and Differential K-Theory_ ([arXiv:0912.2516](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2516))

on the identification of the correct description in [[differential cohomology]] ([[ordinary differential cohomology]] and [[differential K-theory]]) of [[T-duality]] or [[topological T-duality]].

We try to indicate some of the content. There are two main ingredients:

* a [formalization of the setup](#FormalizationOfTheSetup)

which proposes a refinement of the ingredients of [[topological T-duality]] to [[differential cohomology]]; and then the

* [statement of differential T-duality](#StatementOfDifferential T-duality),

which is the assertion that this setup naturally induces the T-duality operation as an [[isomorphism]] on [[twisted differential K-theory]].
