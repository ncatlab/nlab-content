## Idea

Topological domain theory is a generalization of [[domain theory]] that includes a wider collection of [[topological spaces]] than traditional domain theory. The generalization overcomes certain known limitations of domain theory, which is unable to model various awkward combinations of [[computability|computational]] features.
