## Idea

A totally ordered abelian group is an [[ordered abelian group]] whose order forms a [[total order]]. 

## Definition

The following definition is from [[Peter Freyd]]:

A __totally ordered abelian group__ is an [[pseudolattice ordered abelian group]] $G$ such that for all elements $a$ in $G$, $a \leq 0$ or $-a \leq 0$. 

In a totally ordered abelian group, the [[join]] is usually called the __maximum__, while the [[meet]] is usually called the __minimum__  

## Examples

The [[integers]], the [[rational numbers]], and the [[real numbers]] are totally ordered abelian groups.
