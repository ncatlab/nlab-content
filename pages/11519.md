## Idea

Given a linear [[representation]] of a [[group]] ([[topological group]]) $G$ in a [[vector space]]/[[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the corresponding _representation sphere_ is the [[one-point compactification]] of this $\mathbb{R}^n$ (the $n$-[[sphere]]) regarded as a [[G-space]].

Representation spheres induce the [[looping and delooping]] which is used in 
[[RO(G)-grading|RO(G)-garded]] [[equivariant cohomology]] theory, [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by [[genuine G-spectra]] in [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]].

## Construction

To construct a representation sphere $S^V$ associated to a $G$-representation $V$, one can consider the unit sphere $S^V:=S(\mathbb{R}\oplus V)$ where $\mathbb{R}$ carries the trivial representation. Then the [[stereographic projection]] isomorphism $S(\mathbb{R}\oplus V)\setminus \{(1,\mathbf{0})\}\to V$ is manifestly $G$-equivariant, with its inverse exhibiting $S^V$ as the one-point compactification of $V$.

This also makes it clear that for $G$ a [[Lie group]], $S^V$ is a [[smooth manifold]] with smooth $G$-[[action]].
