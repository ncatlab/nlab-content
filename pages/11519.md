## Idea

Given a linear [[representation]] of a [[group]] ([[topological group]]) $G$ in a [[vector space]]/[[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the corresponding _representation sphere_ is the [[one-point compactification]] of this $\mathbb{R}^n$ (the $n$-[[sphere]]) regarded as a [[G-space]].

Representation spheres induce the [[looping and delooping]] which is used in the definition of [[G-spectra]] in [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]].
