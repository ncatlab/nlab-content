In [[superalgebra]] the the _graded commutator_ or _supercommutator_ of two elements of homogeneous degree is

$$
  [a,b] \coloneqq  \left( a b - (-1)^{deg(a) deg(b)} b a\right) 
$$

and extended from there to the whole superalgebra as a [[graded derivation]] in both arguments.

So when at least one of $a$ or $b$ is even graded, then this is the [[commutator]]. When both are odd graded then this is the [[anti-commutator]].

The graded commutator is just the plain commutator [[internalization|internal]] to the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector spaces]].
