## Definition

Let $F\colon A \to B$ be a [[functor]] between [[categories]]. It is **codense** when for each $b \in B$ the following is true:

  $Lim((b \downarrow F) \to A \to B) = b$

(where $(b \downarrow F)$ is an [[comma category]] (in this case the [[under category]]) from $b$ to the functor $F$.

This notion is dual to the notion of [[dense functor]].

Equivalently, a functor $F$ is **codense** iff $Id_B$, together with identity natural transformation $Id_F\colon F \to F$, is the pointwise [[Kan extension]] of $F$ along $F$.

Also, $F$ is **codense** iff  its [[codensity monad]] is the identity.
