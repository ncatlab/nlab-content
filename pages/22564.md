## Definitions

Given a [[cardinal number]] $n$, an __n-ary operation__ on a [[set]] $S$ is a [[function]] $\prod_{i:[n]} (-)_i \colon S^n \to S$ from the [[cartesian power]] $S^n$ to $S$, where [n] is a set with $n$ elements. The __arity__ of the operation is $n$.

More generally, an n-ary operation in a [[multicategory]] is just a [[multimorphism]]. 

## Properties

Every set $S$ with an $n$-ary operation has a morphism $(-)^n:S \to S$ called the __n-th power__ and defined as $x^n := \prod_{i:[n]} x$ for all $x \in S$.
