Bernard Bolzano (1789-1848) was a Bohemian mathematician, logician, and philosopher. 

In his lifetime he was renowned perhaps mainly for his *Wissenschaftslehre* which puts forth an encompassing theory of science. In mathematics, much of his work became well known only after his death, but he can be regarded as an early proponent of [[epsilontic analysis]] and the introduction of rigor in analysis, as for example in the result known as the [[Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem]] (q.v.).
