## Idea

Let $X$ be a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[topological space]]. 

The [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^\bullet$ of its free loop space is the [[Hochschild homology]] $HH_\bullet$ of its [[singular cohomology|singular chains]] $C^\bullet(X)$:

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathcal{L}X)
    \simeq
  HH_\bullet( C^\bullet(X) )
  \,.
$$

Moreover the $S^1$-equivariant cohomology of the loop space, hence the ordinary cohomology of the [[cyclic loop space]] $\mathcal{L}X/^h S^1$ is the [[cyclic homology]] $HC_\bullet$ of the singular chains:

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathcal{L}X/^h S^1)
    \simeq
  HC_\bullet( C^\bullet(X) )
$$

([Loday 11](#Loday11))

If the [[coefficients]] are [[rational numbers|rational]], and $X$ is of [[finite type]] then this may be computed by the _[[Sullivan model for free loop spaces]]_, see there the section on _[Relation to Hochschild homology](Sullivan+model+of+free+loop+space#RelationToHochschildHomology)_.


In the special case that the [[topological space]] $X$ carries the structure of a [[smooth manifold]], then the singular cochains on $X$ are equivalent to the [[dgc-algebra]] of [[differential forms]] (the [[de Rham algebra]]) and hence in this case the statement becomes that 


$$
  H^\bullet(\mathcal{L}X)
    \simeq
  HH_\bullet( \Omega^\bullet(X) )
  \,.
$$

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathcal{L}X/^h S^1)
    \simeq
  HC_\bullet( \Omega^\bullet(X) )
  \,.
$$

This is known as _[[Jones' theorem]]_ ([Jones 87](#Jones87))

An [[(infinity,1)-category theory|infinity-category theoretic]] proof of this fact is indicated at _[Hochschild cohomology -- Jones' theorem](Hochschild+cohomology#JonesTheorem)_.
