## Idea

A microbundle is something like an approximation to the notion of [[vector bundle]]: a locally trivial [[bundle]] $E \to X$ of topological spaces that has a [[section]].

## Definition

### Microbundles

A real __microbundle of dimension $n$__ is a 4-tuple $\xi = (E,p,B,i)$ where 

* $E$ is a [[topological space]] (the _total space_ of $\xi$),

* $B$ is a topological space (the _base space_ of $\xi$, 

* and $p:E\to B$ a continuous map (projection), 

* $i:B\hookrightarrow E$ another continuous map (inclusion of base space) 

such that

* $i$ is a [[section]] of $p$, i.e. $p\circ i = id_B$ 

* the _local triviality_ condition holds: 

  for all $b\in B$, there are neighborhoods $U\ni b$ and $V\ni i(b)$ and a homeomorphism $h:U\times R^n\to V\cap p^{-1}(U)$ such that $p(h(u,v))=u$ and $h(u,0)=i(u)$ for all $u\in U$. The open subspace $i(B)$ is called the _zero section_ of $\xi$. 

### Morphisms of microbundles

A __[[morphism]] of microbundles__ $\phi:\xi\to\xi'$ is a [[germ]] of maps from neighborhoods of the zero section of $\xi$ to $\xi'$, which commutes with projections and inclusions, with composition defined for representatives as composition of functions on smaller neighborhoods. 

In particular, an __[[isomorphism]] of microbundles__ can be represented by a [[homeomorphism]] from a neighborhood $V$ of the zero section in $\xi$ to a neighborhood $V'$ of the zero section in $\xi'$ commuting with projections and inclusions of the zero sections. 


## Examples

### Tangent microbundle

The main example is the __tangent microbundle__ $(M\times M,p_1,M,i)$ of a topological [[manifold]] $M$ where $p_1:M\times M\to M$ is the projection onto the first factor. If $(U,f)$ is a chart of the manifold $M$ around point $x\in M$ (where $x\inU\subset M$ and $f:U\to R^n$ is a homeomorphism with $h(x)=0$) then define $h:U\times R^n\to U\times U$ by $h(u,v)=(u,f^{-1}(f(v)-u))$.

[[David Roberts]]: A couple of years ago I thought of importing topological groupoids to this concept for the following reason: The tangent microbundle $M\times M$, when $M$ is a manifold, is the groupoid integrating the tangent bundle $TM$ of $M$. If we have a general Lie groupoid, we can form the Lie algebroid, which is a very interesting object. If we have a topological groupoid, it seems to me that there should be a microbundle-like object that acts like the algebroid of that groupoid. This should reduce to the tangent microbundle in the case of the codiscrete groupoid = pair groupoid. Perhaps not all topological groupoids would have an associated algebroid, but those wih source and target maps that are [topological submersions](http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com.au%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DxiZgzmXVy9AC%26pg%3DPA66%26lpg%3DPA66%26dq%3Dtopological%2Bsubmersion%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3D8LFo35R79c%26sig%3Dd6GJNwpOF5BM4FX4ag2Q5jfU5UA%26hl%3Den%26ei%3Db4laSoDhOKfs6gPcxs2VCw%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dbook_result%26ct%3Dresult%26resnum%3D1&ei=b4laSoDhOKfs6gPcxs2VCw&usg=AFQjCNEfAa7QvOXntdIikSLkvT1X9U2gjQ) probably will.
