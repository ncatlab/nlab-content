## Idea

A microbundle is something like an approximation to the notion of [[vector bundle]]: a locally trivial [[bundle]] $E \to X$ of topological spaces that has a [[section]]. Indeed, as observed by Milnor,  every vector bundle gives an example of a microbundle (for a modern treatment see [Kupers18, Example 27.2.3](#Kupers18) or Lurie's course, [Topics in Geometric Topology, Lecture 10](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/937notes/937Lecture10.pdf)).

## Definition

### Microbundles

A real __microbundle of dimension $n$__ is a 4-tuple $\xi = (E,p,B,i)$ where 

* $E$ is a [[topological space]] (the _total space_ of $\xi$),

* $B$ is a topological space (the _base space_ of $\xi$, 

* and $p:E\to B$ a continuous map (projection), 

* $i:B\hookrightarrow E$ another continuous map (inclusion of base space) 

such that

* $i$ is a [[section]] of $p$, i.e. $p\circ i = id_B$ 

* the _local triviality_ condition holds: 

  for all $b\in B$, there are neighborhoods $U\ni b$ and $V\ni i(b)$ and a homeomorphism $h:U\times R^n\to V\cap p^{-1}(U)$ such that $p(h(u,v))=u$ and $h(u,0)=i(u)$ for all $u\in U$. The open subspace $i(B)$ is called the _zero section_ of $\xi$. 

### Morphisms of microbundles

A __[[morphism]] of microbundles__ $\phi:\xi\to\xi'$ is a [[germ]] of maps from neighborhoods of the zero section of $\xi$ to $\xi'$, which commutes with projections and inclusions, with composition defined for representatives as composition of functions on smaller neighborhoods. 

In particular, an __[[isomorphism]] of microbundles__ can be represented by a [[homeomorphism]] from a neighborhood $V$ of the zero section in $\xi$ to a neighborhood $V'$ of the zero section in $\xi'$ commuting with projections and inclusions of the zero sections. 


## Examples

### Tangent microbundle

The main example is the __tangent microbundle__ $(M\times M,p_1,M,i)$ of a topological [[manifold]] $M$ where $p_1:M\times M\to M$ is the projection onto the first factor. If $(U,f)$ is a chart of the manifold $M$ around point $x\in M$ (where $x\in U\subset M$ and $f:U\to R^n$ is a homeomorphism with $h(x)=0$) then define $h:U\times R^n\to U\times U$ by $h(u,v)=(u,f^{-1}(f(v)-u))$. 

If $M$ is a smooth manifold, then the tangent microbundle is equivalent to the tangent bundle ([Kupers18, Example 27.2.3](#Kupers18)).
