## Idea

The immediate notion of  [[cohomology]] of [[topological spaces]] which are equipped with a $G$-[[action]] for some [[topological group]] $G$ (often: "[[G-spaces]]", for short) is the ordinary [[equivariant cohomology]] 
$H^*_G(X) \coloneqq H^\bullet(X//G)$ of the [[Borel construction]]/[[homotopy quotient]] of $X$ by $G$. 

In contrast to this, _Bredon cohomology_ is another notion of cohomology of $G$-spaces, defined via the [[orbit category]] $Orb_G$ of $G$: its [[coefficients]] are [[presheaves]] (of [[abelian groups]]) on the [[orbit category]]. 

Hence where ordinary cohomology has as coefficient objects abelian groups, Bredon cohomology has as coefficients [[functors]] 

$$
  Orb_G^{op} \to Ab
$$

from the [[orbit category]] of $G$ into [[Ab]].

This may be understood as a presentation of general [[equivariant cohomology]] in view of [[Elmendorf's theorem]]:

For more technical details see there the section [Bredon equivariant cohomology](equivariant+cohomology#Bredon).

There is an interesting (nontrivially) equivalent definition by Moerdijk and Svensson, using the [[Grothendieck construction]] for a certain $Cat$-valued presheaf on the orbit category.

For orbifolds there is a generalization of $K$-theory which is closely related to the Bredon cohomology (rather than usual equivariant cohomology):
