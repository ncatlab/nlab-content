The usual cohomology for $G$-spaces is the [[equivariant cohomology]] $H^*_G(X)$ (in classical case just the cohomology of the Borel construction $EG\times_G X$, sometimes called in this context the homotopy orbit space). 

Bredon cohomology is another cohomology of $G$-spaces, defined with the help of the [[orbit category]] and its usual coefficients are presheaves of abelian groups on the [[orbit category]]. There is an interesting (nontrivially) equivalent definition by Moerdijk and Svensson, using the [[Grothendieck construction]] for a certain $Cat$-valued presheaf on the orbit category.

For orbifolds there is a generalization of $K$-theory which is closely related to the Bredon cohomology (rather than usual equivariant cohomology):

Integral Deligne cohomology for real projective varieties

We develop an 'integral Deligne cohomology theory' for real varieties which bears to Bredon cohomology the same relation that ordinary Deligne cohomology for complex varieties bears to singular cohomology. The theory has a wide range of connections ranging from equivariant topology (via Bredon equivariant cohomology), through complex differential geometry (via holomorphic line bundles with quadratic forms and holomorphic connections) to number theory (via Milnor K-theory of number fields and regulator maps). We will present --time permitting-- many examples. In a forthcoming work we show that the cycle map from motivic cohomology to Bredon cohomology factors through our Deligne cohomology groups.

In Esnault-Vieweg's survey on Deligne they outline a theory for real varieties, as well. Such a variant would be related to Lichtenbaum's etale motivic cohomology and the Borel version of equivariant cohomology. The difference between their version and ours stems from the difference between the etale and Nisnevich topologies.

## Bredon cohomology

Bigraded equivariant cohomology of real quadrics , by Pedro F. dosSantos and Paulo Lima-Filho: <http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0785>

[arXiv:1206.2781](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1206.2781) Representing Bredon cohomology with local coefficients by crossed complexes and parametrized spectra
from arXiv Front: math.AT by Samik Basu, Debasis Sen
For a discrete group G, we represent the Bredon cohomology with local
coefficients as the homotopy classes of maps in the category of equivaraint
crossed complexes. Subsequently, we construct a naive parametrized G-spectrum,
such that the cohomology theory defined by it reduces to the Bredon cohomology
with local coefficients when restricted to suspension spectra of spaces.
