The usual [[cohomology]] for $G$-spaces is the [[equivariant cohomology]] $H^*_G(X)$ (in classical case just the cohomology of the Borel construction $E G\times_G X$, sometimes called in this context the homotopy orbit space). 

Bredon cohomology is another cohomology of $G$-spaces, defined with the help of the [[orbit category]] and its usual coefficients are presheaves of abelian groups on the [[orbit category]]. 

Where ordinary cohomology has as coefficient objects abelian groups, Bredon cohomology has as coefficients [[functor]]s 

$$
  O(G) \to Ab
$$

from the [[orbit category]] of $G$ into [[Ab]].


There is an interesting (nontrivially) equivalent definition by Moerdijk and Svensson, using the [[Grothendieck construction]] for a certain $Cat$-valued presheaf on the orbit category.

For orbifolds there is a generalization of $K$-theory which is closely related to the Bredon cohomology (rather than usual equivariant cohomology):
