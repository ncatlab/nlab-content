## Statements

If $I$ a [[compact space]] (such as a closed bounded [[interval]] in the [[real line]] and especially the [[unit interval]] $[{0,1}]$), and if $f$ is an [[upper semicontinuous function]] from $I$ to the [[upper real numbers]] $[{-\infty,\infty}[$, then the [[range]] of $f$ is not only bounded above and not only has a finite [[supremum]], but it actually has a [[maximum]] value.  (Similarly, if $f$ is [[lower semicontinuous function|lower semicontinuous]] to the [[lower real numbers]] $]{-\infty,\infty}]$, then $\ran f$ is bounded below by a finite [[infimum]] which is its [[minimum]] value.  Consequently, if $f$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] to the [[real numbers]] $]{-\infty,\infty}[$, then $\ran f$ is [[bounded subset|bounded]] and has both a maximum and a minimum.)

In [[constructive mathematics]], this statement is correct in [[locale theory]], but if we are speaking of pointwise functions defined on a real interval, then it fails in general.
