##Idea
_Aufhebung_ (sublation) is a central concept in the dialectical logic of the German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel. The German expression has several meanings for which _tollere, elevare, conservare_ would be Latin equivalents.[^fine] 

[^fine]: As this polysemy is important for the concept and difficult to preserve in translation we prefer to use the German term in the following.

In his quest to axiomatize the concepts of space and cohesion, [[F. W. Lawvere]] inspired by [[homotopy theory]] proposed a mathematical rendering of the _Aufhebungs_ relation within [[topos theory]]. It is the mathematical concept that will constitute the primary subject in the following.

##Aufhebung in Hegel's 'Wissenschaft der Logik'

Although the two volumes of _'Wissenschaft der Logik'_ - Science of Logic (1st ed. 1812-1816) can be considered as one of the main texts of Hegel's philosophy they fell into disfavour in the second half of the 19th century and most of the 20th century, and accordingly received much less attention than the 'Phänomenologie des Geistes' or the 'Rechtsphilosophie'. They shared this fate with Hegelian philosophy as a whole which apart from the philological interest it generated, was continued only through the political wing of Lefthegelianism which in either its existentialist interpretation by A. Kojève or its Marxist interpretation by G. Lukács openly rejected the concept of objective dialectic in nature thereby seriously severing the social thought from its broad foundation in ontology and logic, whereas the natural philosophical tradition in the vein of F. Engels petrified to the doctrines of dialectical materialism. 

The 'Wissenschaft der Logik' has to be viewed against the background of philosophy in the early 19th century: **Kant** had embarked on a project of 'refoundation', or rather demolition, of metaphysics from an epistemological perspective and this project had been pushed further by his followers especially Fichte in his _Wissensschaftslehre_. However critical these idealist systems had been to the claims of traditional metaphysics and epistemology they all left the traditional logic untouched and in this respect fell behind Leibniz. It is at this point where Hegel starts: he sets out to extend the critical examination of the foundations of knowledge to logic itself.

Heavily influenced by the transcendental deductions and the chapters on dialectical paralogisms in Kant's 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft' he intends to start from nothing and justify the autonomous development of the system of categories. Here dialectics and Aufhebung enter the picture as Hegel conceives the categories not only as not given apriorily but as actually  becoming: _logic ceases to be an inventory of categories but becomes a system of transformations of categories!_ (Had Eilenberg and MacLane in 1945 intended their terminological loans from philosophy as a kind of joke, Lawvere would 25 years later take this terminological proximity at face value.)

Hegels parts with the traditional conception mainly in two points: the foundations of his logic coalesce with ontology into an **objective logic** as the first part is titled (a 'logic of things' as C.S. Peirce would later put it), i.e. he rejects the subject as a possible ground for logic, and he reassesses the status of **negativity** or conflict-contradiction in logic. The cornerstone of the edifice is the anti-eleatic identity of being and nothingness in the idea of becoming. It is precisely this 'positively being negative' that finds its expression in the concept of 'Aufhebung'. 

A key passage on Aufhebung in 'Wissenschaft der Logik' comes at the end of the first chapter ([I.1.1Cc, p.113](#WdL)): after a deduction of the categories of 'being', 'nothingness', and their unity in 'becoming' Hegel determines **dialectics** as 'the higher rational movement... in which the precondition of the separatedness (of the seemingly separated) is lifted ( _sich aufhebt_ )' ([p.111](#WdL)).

He goes on to explicate _Aufheben_ as one of the most important concepts in all of philosophy that constantly recurs everywhere. The sublated - _das Aufgehobene_ is not nothing which is an _unmediated_, but is a mediated - _ein Vermitteltes_; it is nothing - _das Nichtseiende_, but as a result that originated from a being and therefore still carries with it the determination from which it derives. We see here how Hegel tries to combine Leibniz' identification of being with being determinate with Spinoza's 'omni determinatio est negatio': **Aufhebung** is the mode of this coexistence of negation-affirmation.

Clearly, these remarks can not do justice to the richness and subtlety of Hegel's logic and should only serve as canvas against which to get a better grasp of Lawvere's conceptual translation. The points to keep in mind from this view are:

* Aufhebung is a _pervasive_ concept: although Lawvere proposes only mathematical definitions for two terms of Hegel's logic, namely _unity of opposites_ and _Aufhebung_, these are in fact the key terms and go already far in a reconstruction of the whole edifice!

* Aufhebung unites _determinatedness_ with annihilation of being. These recur at the mathematical level as the correspondance between being-being a sheave, annihilation -being the adjoint opposite of sheaf (anti-sheaf), and the determination of Aufhebung as being the least (=the Leibnizian best) level of being simultaneously a sheaf and an anti-sheaf.

##Lawvere's Path to _Aufhebung_

>In early 1985, while I was studying the foundations of homotopy theory, it occurred to me that the explicit use of a certain simple categorical structure might serve as a link between mathematics and philosophy. ([Lawvere 1996](#Lawvere96), p.167)

##A Guide to the Literature

The book by La Palme-Reyes-Zolfaghari (2004) provides a good entry to the mathematics of Lawvere from an elementary point of view and contains even a page on the adjoint cylinder.

The known mathematical results on the Aufhebungs relation are contained in the paper by Kennett-Riehl-Roy-Zaks (2010) which is based on older phd-works by some of the authors.

Further results on essential localizations can be found in the papers by Johnstone (1996), Vitale (2001) and Lucyshyn-Wright (2011).
