#Idea#

A **topological quantum field theory** is a [[quantum field theory]] which is a [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]] is a functor on the [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]] $Bord_n$ that do not carry any further structure.

For more on the general idea and its development, see [[FQFT]] and [[extended topological quantum field theory]]. For the central structural result in [[TQFT]], the [[cobordism hypothesis]] see

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]


#Remarks#

* often topological _quantum_ field theories are just called _topological field theories_ and accordingly the abbreviation TQFT is reduced to TFT. Strictly speaking this is a misnomer, which is however convenient and very common. It should be noted, however, that TQFTs may have classical counterparts (for instance [[Chern-Simons theory]]) which would better deserve to be called TFTs. But they are not usually.

#Non-topological QFTs#

In constrast to topological QFTs, non-topological quantum field theories in the [[FQFT]] description are $n$-functors on $n$-categories $Bord^S_n$ whose morphisms are manifolds with extra $S$-structure, for instance

* $S =$ conformal structure $\to$ [[conformal field theory]]

* $S =$ [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian structure]] $\to$ "euclidean QFT"

* $S =$ [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo-Riemannian structure]] $\to$ "relativistic QFT"

#Examples#

* [[2d TQFT]]

* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]

* [[Chern-Simons theory]]

* [[Reshetikhin-Turaev model]]

* [[Turaev-Viro model]]

#Homotopy QFTs#
 These somehow lie between the previous two types. There is some simple extra structure in the form of a 'characteristic map' from the manifolds and bordisms to a 'background space' $X$. 
In many of the simplest examples, this is taken to be the [[classifying space]] of a group, but this is not the only case that can be considered.  The topic is explored more fully in [[HQFT]].
