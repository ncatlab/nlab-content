An $A_\infty$-ring is a [[monoid in an (∞,1)-category]] when the latter is additive, e.g. a [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable category]]. Alternative one can take a model which is a (non-homotopic) additive monoidal category, but the monoid is replaced by an algebra over a resolution of the associative operad.

For example there is a variant for the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]]. Sometimes this is called an [[associative ring spectrum]].

This may be modeled equivalently as an ordinary [[monoid]] with respect to the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].

Notice the difference to an ordinary [[ring spectrum]] which which is not necessarily coherently homotopy-associative.

$A_\infty$-rings play the role of [[ring]]s in [[higher algebra]].

The higher analog of a commutative ring is an $E_\infty$-[[E-∞-ring|ring]].

Another version of the $A_\infty$-ring is simply what is usually called the $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebra]] in the case when the [[ground ring]] is the ring of integers. See
