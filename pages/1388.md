Another term for [[associative ring spectrum]].

+-- {: .query}

It seems that it should be true that an associative ring spectrum is equivalently 

* an algebra over some [[A-infinity operad]] in chain complexes of abelian groups;

* an algebra object in the monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category of spectra. 

I am still trying to find out to which degree both definitions are equivalent.

See also the discussion at [[E-infinity ring]].
