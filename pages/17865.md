## Idea

Given a [[hyperplane]] in a [[Euclidean space]], then _reflection_ at that hyperplane is the operation that sends each point to its mirror image at that hyperplane, the result of translating the point in the [[direction of a vector|direction]] [[perpendicular]] to the hyperplane by twice its [[distance]] to the hyperplane.
