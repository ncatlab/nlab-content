###### Definition

A _simplicial topological group_ is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] of [[topological groups]].

=--

For various applications the ambient category [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s is taken specifically to be 

* the [[category]] of [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weakly Hausdorff space]]s, or

* or the category of [[k-space]]s.

We take [[Top]] to be the category of [[k-space]]s in the following.

###### Definition

A simplicial topological group $G$ is called **well-pointed** if for $*$ the trivial simplicial topological group and $i : * \to G$ the unique [[homomorphism]], all components $i_n : * \to G_n$ are [[closed cofibrations]].

=--

For $B \in Top$ a fixed base object, it is often desirable to work in "$B$-parameterized families", hence in the [[over-category]] $Top/B$ (see [MaySigurdson](#MaySigurdson)). There is the 
[[Strøm model structure|relative Strøm model structure]] on $Top/B$.

###### Definition

A simplicial group in $G$ in $Top/B$ is called **well-sectioned** if for $B$ the trivial simplicial topological group over $B$ and $i : B \to G$ the unique [[homomorphism]], all components $i_n : B \to G_n$ are $\bar f$-cofibrations.

=--


## Properties


Recall for a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[simplicial group]] $G$ the notation $\bar W G \to W G$ for the [[Kan complex]] presentation of the [[universal principal infinity-bundle]] $\mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G$ from [[simplicial group]]. These constructions for discrete simplicial groups have immediate analogs for simplicial topological groups.

###### Definition

Let $G$ be a simplicial topological group. Write $\bar W G \in Top^{\Delta^{op}}$ for the [[simplicial topological space]] whose topological space of $n$-[[simplices]] is the [[product]]

$$
  \bar W G_n := G_{n-1} \times G_{n-2} \cdots \times G_{0}
$$

in [[Top]], equipped wwith the evident (...) face and degeneracy maps.

###### Definition

We say a morphism $f : X \to Y$ of [[simplicial topological space]]s is a **global Kan fibration** if for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$ the canonical morphism

$$
  X_n \to Y_n \times_{sTop(\Lambda^n_k, Y)} sTop(\Lambda^n_k, X)
$$

in [[Top]] has a [[section]], where 

* $\Lambda^n_k \in $ [[sSet]] $\hookrightarrow Top^{\Delta^{op}}$ is the $k$th $n$-[[horn]] regarded as a [[discrete space|discrete]] [[simplicial topological space]]:

* $sTop(-,-) : sTop^{op} \times sTop \to Top$ is the [[Top]]-[[hom object]].

We say a [[simplicial topological space]] $X_\bullet \in Top^{\Delta^{op}}$ is **(global) Kan simplicial space** if the unique morphism $X_\bullet \to *$ is a global Kan fibration, hence if for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $0 \leq i \leq n$ the canonical [[continuous function]]

$$
  X_n \to sTop(\Lambda^n_k, X)
$$

into the [[topological space]] of $k$th $n$-[[horn]]s admits a [[section]].

This global notion of Kan simplicial spaces is considered for instance in ([BrownSzczarba](#BrownSzczarba)) and ([May](#May)).

###### Proposition

Let $G$ be a simplicial topological group. Then 

1. $G$ is a globally Kan simplicial topological space;

1. $\bar W G$ is a globally Kan simplicial topological space;

1. $W G \to \bar W G$ is a global Kan fibration.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement appears as ([BrownSzczarba, theorem 3.8](#BrownSzczarba)), the second is noted in ([RobertsStevenson](#RobertsStevenson)), the third as ([BrownSzczarba, lemma 6.7](#BrownSzczarba)).

###### Proposition

If $G$ is a [well-pointed](#WellPointedSimplicialTopologicalGroup) simplicial topological group, then

1. $G$ is a [[nice simplicial topological space|good simplicial topological space]];

1. the [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces|geometric realization]] $|G|$ is well-pointed;

1. $\bar W G$ is a [[nice simplicial topological space|proper simplicial topological space]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The statement about $\bar W G$ is proven in ([RobertsStevenson](#RobertsStevenson)). The other statements are referenced there.
