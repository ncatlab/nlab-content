_[Planet Math](http://planetmath.org/)_ was a virtual community that aimed to help make mathematical knowledge more accessible. PlanetMath's content was created collaboratively: the main feature is the 
[mathematics encyclopedia](http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia), a Wiki on [[mathematics]] with entries written and reviewed by members.

The project appears to have gone inactive not later than 2013,
the year in which any nontrivial editing activity seems to have stopped.
