_[Planet Math](http://planetmath.org/)_ is a virtual community which aims to help make mathematical knowledge more accessible. PlanetMath's content is created collaboratively: the main feature is the 
[mathematics encyclopedia](http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia), a Wiki on [[mathematics]] with entries written and reviewed by members.

The (future) vision behind the PlanetMath project is indicated in
