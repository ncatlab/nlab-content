## Idea

In [[physics]], a _Lagrangian quantum field theory_ is a _[[quantum field theory]]_ (QFT) which arises via some version of [[quantization]] from a [[Lagrangian density]], hence from a [[prequantum field theory]].

Most QFTs that are being considered are Lagrangian quantum field theories. Indeed all of traditional [[perturbative quantum field theory]], subsuming in particular [[QED]], [[EW]], [[QCD]], [[pQG]] and hence the [[standard model of particle physics]], is Lagrangian. 

But not all QFTs are Lagrangian. For example [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] (such as for example the _chiral_ [[WZW model]], which is "one half" of the Lagrangian WZW model) is not Lagrangian. Still, this is thought be be defined via the [[holographic principle]] as the holographic boundary of a QFT that is Lagrangian: [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]].
