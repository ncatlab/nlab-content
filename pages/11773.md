## Idea

A _[[quantum field theory]]_ which arises via [[quantization]] from a [[Lagrangian]]/an [[action functional]], hence from a [[prequantum field theory]].

## Examples and counter examples

By far most QFTs that appear in textbooks are Lagrangian.

But not all QFTs are Lagrangian, for instance [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] is not Lagrangian, but is defined via a [[holographic principle]] as the holographic boundary of a QFT that is Lagrangian: [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]].
