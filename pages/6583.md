## Idea

__Hofer's metric__ is a metric on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold. This group is infinite-dimensional, so that the existence of this metric is a very nontrivial due noncompactness. The subject of Hofer's geometry is now a classic subject in [[symplectic geometry]].
