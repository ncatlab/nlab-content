## Idea

An $n$-dimensional _Calabi-Yau variety_ is an $n$-dimensional [[Kähler manifold]] with (holomorphically, rather than topologically) trivial [[canonical bundle]]. This is equivalent to having $SU(N)$-[[holonomy]]. 

For [[compact topological space|compact]] K#hler manifolds, [[Yau's theorem]] (also known as the  [[Calabi conjecture]]) implies that the above conditions are also equivalent to the vanishing of the first [[Chern class]].

+--{.query}
Is it also true for non-compact?
=--

Note that $c_1(X) = 0$ implies in general that the canonical bundle is *topologically trivial*. But if $X$ is a compact Kaehler manifold, $c_1(X) = 0$ implies further that the canonical bundle is *holomorphically trivial*.

+--{.query}
The language used in this article is implicitly analytic, rather than algebraic. Is this OK? Or should I make this explicit?

## Generalized Definition

A Calabi-Yau variety can be described algebraically as a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[proper scheme|proper]] [[variety]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ over a [[field]] $k$ (not necessarily [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] and not necessarily of [[characteristic]] $0$) in which $\omega_X=\wedge^n\Omega^1\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$ and also $H^j(X, \mathcal{O}_X)=0$ for all $1\leq j \leq n-1$.

If the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, then one can form the analyticification of $X$ and obtain a [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]] that satisfies the first given definition.

## Examples
