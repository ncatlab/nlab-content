## Idea

A generalization of the [[univalence axiom]] for strict Tarski universes and [[propositional extensionality]] for strict [[types of propositions]] to any type with a type family, by way of the definitional equality $T(a \simeq_U b) \equiv T(a) \simeq T(b)$ for strict Tarski universes $(U, T)$ and the definitional equality $T(a \iff_\Omega b) \equiv T(a) \simeq T(b)$ for strict types of propositions $(\Omega, T)$. 

## Definition

In [[intensional type theory]], let $A$ be a type and suppose $A$ comes with a [[type family]] $B$ indexed by $A$. There are two ways to say that elements $a:A$ and $b:A$ are the same in the index type $A$: the identity type $a =_A b$, and the type of equivalences between the dependent types $B(a) \simeq B(b)$. It follows from the rules of [[identity types]] that there is a canonical [[transport]] function
$$\mathrm{trans}^B(a, b):(a =_A b) \to (B(a) \simeq B(b))$$
for all $a:A$ and $b:A$. The structure $(A, B)$ is said to be **univalent** if the above transport function is an equivalence of types
$$\mathrm{trans}^B(a, b):(a =_A b) \simeq (B(a) \simeq B(b))$$
for all $a:A$ and $b:B$. 

This is the extensionality principle for any type $A$ with a type family $B$. 

## Construction via a higher inductive-inductive type

Let $(A, B)$ be a type $A$ with a type family $B$. Then one could construct a univalent type with a type family as the [[higher inductive type|higher]] [[inductive-inductive type]] $(A', B')$ generated by

* a function $f:A \to A'$
* a function $g(a):B(a) \to B'(a)$ for all terms $a:A$
* a function 
$\mathrm{eq}_{A'}(a, b):(B(a) \simeq B(b)) \to (f(a) =_{A'} f(b))$ for all terms $a:A$ and $b:A$. 

Since every strict Tarski universe is a type $T$ with a type family $U$, this allows for every non-univalent strict Tarski universe to be made univalent. The same is true for any strict [[type of propositions]]. 

## Examples

* [[univalent universes]]

* univalent [[types of propositions]]

* (univalent) [[concrete categories]]

* univalent models of [[ETCS with elements]]

* univalent models of [[SEAR]]
