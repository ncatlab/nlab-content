## Idea

A generalization of the [[univalence axiom]] for strict Tarski universes to any type with a type family, by way of the definitional equality $T(a \simeq_U b) \equiv T(a) \simeq T(b)$ for strict Tarski universes $(U, T)$. 

## Definition

In [[intensional type theory]], let $A$ be a type and suppose $A$ comes with a [[type family]] $B$ indexed by $A$. There are two ways to say that elements $a:A$ and $b:A$ are the same in the index type $A$: the identity type $a =_A b$, and the type of equivalences between the dependent types $B(a) \simeq B(b)$. It follows from the rules of [[identity types]] that there is a canonical [[transport]] function
$$\mathrm{trans}^B(a, b):(a =_A b) \to (B(a) \simeq B(b))$$
for all $a:A$ and $b:A$. The structure $(A, B)$ is said to be **univalent** if the above transport function is an equivalence of types
$$\mathrm{trans}^B(a, b):(a =_A b) \simeq (B(a) \simeq B(b))$$
for all $a:A$ and $b:B$. 

This is the structure identity principle for any type $A$ with a type family $B$.
