## Idea

In [[logic]] and [[type theory]], _decidability_ is the property of the [[theory]] of admitting for each [[term]] a terminating procuedure for determining its [[type]].

Adding certain [[axioms]] may make decidable theories undecidable. For instance [[intensional type theory]] is decidable, but adding the axiom of [[extensional equality]] (turning it into [[extensional type theory]]) makes type-checking undecidable.
