## Discussion

This was originally at [[bicategory]]:

_Sebastian_: Is there a formal meaning of _weak enrichment_? 

[[John Baez]]: Yes there is; indeed Clark Barwick is writing a huge book on this.

_Sebastian_: If not, is there at least a method how to get the definition of a weak $n$-category if I know the definition of a (strict) $n$-category?

[[John Baez]]: that sounds harder!  That's like pushing a rock uphill.  It's easier to go down from weak to strict.

_Sebastian_: Of course, I have recognised that there are actually different definitions of what a weak n-category should be... so to give my question a bit more precision: How do I get a definition of a weak $n$-category that is as close as possible to the definition of a strict $n$-category? The weak $n$-category should be what you call "globular", I think. (Are there different definitions of globular (weak or strict) n-categories?)

[[John Baez]]: globular strict n-categories have been understood since time immemorial, or at least around 1963, and there is just one reasonable definition.   Globular weak n-categories were defined in the 1990s by Michael Batanin, and his theory relates them quite nicely to the globular strict ones.   But there is also a _different_ definition of globular weak n-categories due to Penon.  It had a mistake in it which has now been fixed.

From the preface to [[johnbaez:Towards Higher Categories|Towards Higher Categories]]:

There is a quite different and more extensively developed operadic approach to globular [[nlab:weak omega-category|weak infinity-categories]] due to Batanin (Bat1, Str2), with a variant due to Leinster (Lein3).  Penon (Penon) gave a related, very compact definition of infinity-category; this definition was later corrected and improved by Batanin (Bat2) and Cheng and Makkai (ChMakkai).

You can get the references there.

I think this discussion should be moved over to some page on n-categories, since it's not really about bicategories.
