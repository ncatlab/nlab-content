In SGA I.6 [[Grothendieck]] and [[Pierre Gabriel]] presented the formalism of [[Grothendieck fibration|fibered categories]] and descent; the exposition and the terminology emphasises a version of the [[relative point of view]] for categories. Thus they start with preliminaries over the [[overcategory|slice]] [[2-category]] $Cat/C$ of functors with fixed target category $C$. Objects in $Cat/C$ are thus called **categories over $C$** and the morphisms are called **functors over $C$**. Standard passages between different slice categories are via the [[base change]] and the cobase change 2-functors. 

An important sub-2-category of $Cat/C$ is the 2-category of [[fibered categories]] over $C$; this is not a [[full subcategory|full]] sub-2-category: one restricts only to **[[cartesian functor]]s** among fibered categories. The 2-categories $Cat/C$ are fibers in a [[codomain fibration|codomain 2-fibration]] $Cat^2$ over $Cat$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Is that really a 2-fibration?  You can pull back along $Cat/C \to Cat/D$ along a functor $f\colon D\to C$, but can you do anything with a natural transformation $f\to f'$?

Zoran: sorry there is indeed an error there, but I will not yet erase it, as there is (in my memory) a partial repair of the statement for which I need to sit down to formulate precisely.

Its restriction to the sub-2-category $Fib$ of fibered categories is then also a Grothendieck 2-fibration $Fib\to Cat$ which has been studied by [[Claudio Hermida]].
