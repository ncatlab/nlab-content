
Sometimes called Hadamard lemma, however, in $n$Lab, [[Hadamard lemma]] is another result of Hadamard, in analysis.

## Geometrical motivation

__Hadamard's formula__ relates the Ad action of a Lie group on its [[tangent Lie algebra]], with the ad action of the Lie algebra on itself.

## Statement

$$
e^X Y e^{-X} = e^{ad X} (Y)
$$
