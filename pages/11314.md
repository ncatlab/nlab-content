## Idea

Since the nature of [[atoms]] is described by [[quantum mechanics]] and since [[chemistry]] deals with compounds of atoms -- [[molecules]] -- it is ultimately based on quantum mechanics, but typically the detailed quantum mechanical processes are heavily coarse-grained to effective laws of chemistry. In contrast to this _quantum chemistry_ studies chemical effects explicitly with more of the detailed quantum mechanics underlying them taken into account.
