## Idea

Since the nature of [[atoms]] is described by [[quantum mechanics]] and since [[chemistry]] deals with [[bound states]] of atoms -- [[molecules]] -- it is ultimately based on [[quantum physics]], but typically the detailed quantum mechanical processes are heavily coarse-grained to effective laws of chemistry. In contrast to this _quantum chemistry_ studies chemical effects explicitly with more of the detailed quantum mechanics underlying them taken into account. For example, quantum mechanics may be used to explain the [[periodic table of chemical elements]] through the occupation of their electron shells ([Feynman63](#Feynman63)).
