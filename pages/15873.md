A category is **essentially affine** if its change of base functors for its [[fibration of points]] are [[equivalences]] of categories. An essentially affine category is both [[protomodular category|protomodular]] and [[Mal'cev category|Mal'cev]]. Every subobject is [[normal subobject|normal]].

Borceux and Bourn liken an essentially affine category to a non-pointed [[abelian category]] (see [[Borceux-Bourn]]).

##Example

* The category of abelian extensions of an arbitrary group $G$.
