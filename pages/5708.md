* [[Kevin Costello]], 

  _Renormalization and effective field theory_  

  Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, Volume 170  
  
  American Mathematical Society (2011)

  ([talk slides](http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~costello/slides.pdf))

on [[renormalization]] and [[BV-quantization]] of [[effective quantum field theory]] of those [[quantum field theories]] whose [[action functional]] can be brought into "[BV-CS form](renormalization#OfTheoriesInBVForm)" $S(\phi) = \langle \phi, Q \phi\rangle + I(\phi)$.

Much of the content is based on the article

* [[Kevin Costello]], _Renormalisation and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism_ ([arXiv:0706.1533](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1533))

which focuses on [[Chern-Simons theory]], as well as

* [[Kevin Costello]], _Topological conformal field theories and gauge theories_ ([arXiv:math/0605647](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605647))

which focuses on [[Yang-Mills theory]].

The methods of the book are designed to allow to construct [[quantum field theories]] in the form of [[factorization algebras of observables]] (see there for more details) as discussed in 

* [[Kevin Costello]], [[Owen Gwilliam]], _[[Factorization algebras in perturbative quantum field theory]]_
