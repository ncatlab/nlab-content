## Idea

A [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector bundle]] over a [[complex manifold]] such that it admits [[transition functions]] that are [[holomorphic functions]].

## Properties

### As complex algebraic vector bundles

By the [[GAGA]]-principle holomorphic vector bundles and more generally analytic [[coherent sheaves]] over a [[projective variety|projetive]] [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[complex variety]] coincide with complex [[algebraic vector bundles]]/[[coherent sheaves]].

###### Theorem 
**([[Koszul-Malgrange theorem]])**

Holomorphic vector bundles over a [[complex manifold]] are equivalently [[complex vector bundles]] which are equipped with a holomorphically [[flat connection]] (hence a connection whose holomorphic component vanishes). Under this identification the [[Dolbeault operator]] $\bar \partial$ acting on the [[sections]] of the holomorphic vector bundle is identified with the holomorphic component of the [[covariant derivative]] of the given connection.

The analogous statement is true for generalization of vector bundles to [[chain complexes]] of [[module sheaves]] with [[coherent cohomology]].

=--

For [[complex vector bundles]] over [[complex varieties]] this statement is due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and ([Koszul-Malgrange 58](#KoszulMalgrange58)), recalled for instance as ([Pali 06, theorem 1](#Pali06)). It may be understood as a special case of the [[Newlander-Nirenberg theorem]], see ([Delzant-Py 10, section 6](#DelzantPy10)), which also generalises the proof to [[infinite-dimensional manifold|infinite-dimensional]] vector bundles. Over [[Riemann surfaces]], see [below](#OverRiemannSurfaces), the statement was highlighted in ([Atiyah-Bott 83](#AtiyahBott83)) in the context of the [[Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem]]. 

The generalization from [[vector bundles]] to  [[coherent sheaves]] is due to ([Pali 06](#Pali06)). In the genrality of [[(∞,1)-categories of chain complexes]] ([[dg-categories]]) of holomorphic vector bundles the statement is discussed in ([Block 05](#Block05)).

###### Remark

The equivalence in theorem \ref{KoszulMalgrangeTheorem} serves to relate a fair bit of [[differential geometry]]/[[differential cohomology]] with constructions in [[algebraic geometry]]. For instance [[intermediate Jacobians]] arise in [[differential geometry]] and [[quantum field theory]] as [[moduli spaces of flat connections]] equipped with [[symplectic structure]] and [[Kähler polarization]], all of which in terms of [[algebraic geometry]] directly comes down [[moduli spaces]] of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the [[structure sheaf]] (and/or some variants of that, under the exponential exact sequence).

### Over Riemann surfaces
 {#OverRiemannSurfaces}

Over [[Riemann surfaces]] holomorphic vector bundles are a central part of the theory of the [[moduli space of flat connections]]. See at _[[Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem]]_.

A key observation here is ([Atiyah-Bott 83, section 7](#AtiyahBott83)), that a $U(n)$-[[principal connection]] induces a holomorphic structure on the [[associated bundle|associated]] [[complex vector bundle]] by taking the $(0,1)$-part of the connection 1-form as the [[Dolbeault operator]]. For review of the statement and its proof see ([Evans, lecture 10](#Evans)).
