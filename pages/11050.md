## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] and specifically in [[quantum computation]]/[[quantum information]], _Bloch region_ is the name of the [[convex space]] of [[density matrices]] on a given [[Hilbert space]].

Equivalently this is the space of [[mixed states|mixed]] [[quantum states]] for a [[quantum mechanical system]] with the lines in given [[Hilbert space]] as its [[pure states]].

The [[superoperators]] that preserve Bloch regions (also for products, "complete positivity") are called _[[quantum operations]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to the simplex

For $(n+1) \in \mathbb{N}$ a natural number, the Bloch region in the $(n+1)$-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is a [[quantum physics]]-analog of the space of [[probability measures]] on the [[finite set]] of $(n+1)$ elements. This in turn is equivalently the standard $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$.
