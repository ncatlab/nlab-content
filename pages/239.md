## Idea

The term **tensor product** has many different but closely related meanings.

* In its original sense a _tensor product_ 
is a representing object for a suitable sort of _multilinear map_.  The most classical versions are for vector spaces, and more generally modules over a ring.  In modern language this takes place in a [[multicategory]].

* Consequently, the functor $\otimes : C \times C \to C$ which is part of the data of a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is also often called a _tensor product_, since in many examples of monoidal categories it is induced from a tensor product in the above sense (and in fact, _any_ monoidal category underlies a multicategory in a canonical way).  In parts of the literature (certain) abelian monoidal categories are even addressed as _tensor categories_. 

* Given two objects in a [[monoidal category]] $(C,\otimes)$ with a right and left [[action]], respectively, of some [[monoid]] $A$, their _tensor product over $A$_ is the quotient of their tensor product in $C$ by this action.  If $A$ is commutative, then this is a special case of the tensor product in a multicategory.

* This generalizes to modules over [[monad|monads]] in a bicategory, which includes the notion of _tensor product of functors_.  

* Finally, tensor products in a multicategory and tensor products over monads in a bicategory are both special cases of tensor products in an [[virtual double category]].

## Tensor product in a multicategory

If $M$ is a [[multicategory]] and $A$ and $B$ are objects in $M$, then the _tensor product_ $A \otimes B$ can be defined to be an object equipped with a [[universal construction|universal]] multimorphism  $A,B\to A \otimes B$.  Thus, any multimorphism  $A,B\to C$ factors uniquely through $A,B\to A \otimes B$ via a (1-ary) morphism $A \otimes B\to C$.

For example, if $M$ is the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups, made into a multicategory using multilinear maps as the multimorphisms, then we get the usual tensor product of abelian groups. That is, $A \otimes B$ is equipped with a universal map from $A \times B$ (as a set) to $C$ such that this map is linear (a group homomorphism) in each argument separately.  This tensor product can also be constructed explicitly by

1. starting with the cartesian product $A\times B$ in sets,
1. generating a _free_ abelian group from it, and then
1. quotienting by relations $(a_1,b)+(a_2,b)\sim (a_1+a_2,b)$ and $(a,b_1)+(a,b_2)\sim (a,b_1+b_2)$.  (The 0-ary relations $(0,b)\sim 0$ and $(a,0)\sim 0$ follow automatically; you need them explicitly if you generalise to [[abelian monoid]]s.)

Note that in this case, $A\otimes B$ is not a subobject _or_ a quotient of the cartesian product $A\times B$.  However, in many other cases the tensor product in a multicategory _can_ be obtained as a quotient of some other pre-existing product; see "tensor product of modules," below.

Other examples of tensor products in multicategories:

* The [[Gray tensor product]] of [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]] is a tensor product in the multicategory of 2-categories and [[cubical functor]]s.  Likewise for Sjoerd Crans' tensor product of Gray-categories.

In particular, any [[closed category]] (even if not monoidal) has an underlying multicategory.  Tensor products in this multicategory are characterized by the adjointness relation
$$ \hom(A\otimes B, C) \cong \hom(A, \hom(B,C)). $$
This may be the oldest notion of tensor product, since the definition of the internal-hom of abelian groups and vector spaces, unlike that of their tensor product, is intuitively obvious.

##Strong universality##

While the universal property referred to above (every bilinear map $A,B\to C$ factors uniquely through $A,B\to A\otimes B$ via a map $A\otimes B \to C$) suffices to define the tensor product, it does not suffice to prove that it is associative and unital.  For this we need the stronger property that any multilinear map $D_1,\dots,D_m,A,B,E_1,\dots, E_n \to C$ factors uniquely through $A,B\to A\otimes B$ via a multilinear map $D_1,\dots,D_m, A\otimes B ,E_1,\dots, E_n \to C$.

## Tensor product of modules in a monoidal category

Let $R$ be a commutative ring and consider the multicategory $R$-Mod of $R$-modules and $R$-multilinear maps.  In this case the tensor product $A\otimes_R B$ of $R$-modules $A$ and $B$ can be constructed as the quotient of the tensor product $A\otimes B$ of their underlying abelian groups by the action of $R$; that is,
$$ A\otimes_R B = A\otimes B / (a,r\cdot b) \sim (a\cdot r,b). $$
More category-theoretically, this can be constructed as the coequalizer of the two maps
$$ A\otimes R \otimes B \;\rightrightarrows\; A\otimes B $$
given by the action of $R$ on $A$ and on $B$.  If $R$ is a [[field]], then $R$-modules are vector spaces; this gives probably the most familiar case of a tensor product spaces, which is also probably the situation where the concept was first conceived.

This tensor product can be generalized to the case when $R$ is not commutative, as long as $A$ is a right $R$-module and $B$ is a left $R$-module.  More generally yet, if $R$ is a [[monoid]] in any [[monoidal category]] (a ring being a monoid in [[Ab]] with its tensor product), we can define the tensor product of a left and a right $R$-module in an analogous way.  If $R$ is a commutative monoid in a [[symmetric monoidal category]], so that left and right $R$-modules coincide, then $A\otimes_R B$ is again an $R$-module, while if $R$ is not commutative then $A\otimes_R B$ will no longer be an $R$-module of any sort.

* Not all tensor products in multicategories are instances of this construction.  In particular, the tensor product in [[Ab]] is not the tensor product of modules over any monoid in the cartesian monoidal category [[Set]].  Abelian groups _can_ be considered as "sets with an action by something," but that something is more complicated than a monoid: it is a special sort of [[monad]] called a [[commutative theory]].

* Conversely, if $R$ is a _commutative_ monoid in a symmetric monoidal category, there is a multicategory of $R$-modules whose tensor product agrees with the coequalizer defined above, but if $R$ is not commutative this is impossible.  However, see the section on tensor products in virtual double categories, below.

## Tensor product of modules in a bicategory

The tensor product of left and right modules over a noncommutative monoid in a monoidal category is a special case of the tensor product of modules for a [[monad]] in a [[bicategory]].  If $R: x\to x$ is a monad in a bicategory $B$, a right $R$-module is a 1-cell $A: y\to x$ with an action by $R$, a left $R$-module is a 1-cell $B: x\to z$ with an action by $R$, and their tensor product, if it exists, is a 1-cell $y\to z$ given by a similar coequalizer.  Regarding a monoidal category as a 1-object bicategory, this recovers the above definition.

For example, consider the bicategory $V-Mat$ of $V$-valued [[matrix|matrices]] for some monoidal category $V$.  A monad in $V-Mat$ is a $V$-[[enriched category]] $A$, an $(A,I)$-bimodule is a functor $A\to V$, an $(I,A)$-bimodule is a functor $A^{op}\to V$, and their tensor product in $V-Mat$ is a classical construction called the **tensor product of functors**.  It can also be defined as a [[end|coend]].

## Tensor product in a virtual double category

A [[virtual double category]] is a common generalization of a multicategory and a bicategory (and actually of a [[double category]]).  Among other things, it has objects, 1-cells, and "multi-2-cells."  We leave it to the reader to define a notion of tensor product of 1-cells in such a context, analogous to the tensor product of objects in a multicategory.  A multicategory can be regarded as a 1-object virtual double category, so this generalizes the notion of tensor product in a multicategory.

On the other hand, in any bicategory (in fact, any double category) there is a virtual double category whose objects are monads and whose 1-cells are bimodules, and the tensor product in this virtual double category is the tensor product of modules in a bicategory defined above.  Thus, tensor products in a virtual double category include all notions of tensor product discussed above.
