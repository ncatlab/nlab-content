## Idea

An [[algebraic curve]] with a cirtain [[singular point of an algebraic variety]].

## The nodal cubic

For nodal [[cubic curve]] (over some base) is (see at _[ellitpic curve -- Nodal curves and cuspidal curves](elliptic+curve#EllipticCurvesNodalCurvesCuspidalCurves)_ for notation and background) the solution to the [[Weierstrass equation]] for which the [[discriminant]] vanishes, but the modular invariant $c_4$ does not.

## Properties of the nodal cubic

### Compactified moduli stack of elliptic curves and the Tate curve

The nodal [[cubic curve]] is not an [[elliptic curve]], as it is singular, but adding it to the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] $\mathcal{M}_{ell}$ produces the [[Deligne-Mumford compactification|compactification]] $\mathcal{M}_{\overline{ell}}$ which is often relevant.

The [[formal neighbourhood]] of the nodal curve in $\mathcal{M}_{\overline{ell}}$ is the [[Tate curve]].
