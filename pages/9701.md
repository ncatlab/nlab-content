## Idea

The _clutching construction_ is the construction of a $G$-[[principal bundle]] on an [[n-sphere]] from a [[cocycle]] in $G$-[[Cech cohomology]] given by the [[covering]] of the $n$-sphere by two [[hemi-n-spheres]] that overlap a bit at the equator, and one single transition function on that equator $S^{n-1} \to G$.

## Examples

### Basic example

The [[Möbius strip]] is the result of the single non-trivial clutching construction for [[real vector bundles|real]] [[line bundle]] over the [[circle]].

### In physics

In [[physics]], in [[gauge theory]], the clutching construction plays a central role in the discussion of [[Yang-Mills instantons]], and [[monopoles]] ([[Dirac monopole]]). Here the discussion is usually given in terms of [[gauge fields]] on $n$-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]] such that they [[vanishing at infinity|vanish at infinity]]. Equivalently this means that one has [[gauge fields]] on the [[one-point compactification]] of Minkowski spacetime, which is the [[n-sphere]]. The transition function of the clutching construction then appears as the asymptotic [[gauge transformation]].
