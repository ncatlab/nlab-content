## Idea

The _clutching construction_ is the construction of a $G$-[[principal bundle]] on an [[n-sphere]] from a [[cocycle]] in $G$-[[Cech cohomology]] given by the [[covering]] of the $n$-sphere by two semi-$n$-spheres that overlap a bit at the equator, and one single transition function on that equator $S^{n-1} \to G$.
