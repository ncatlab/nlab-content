Fundamental physics is all based on the _[[gauge principle]]_. This says in particular that it is wrong to think of two different _[[gauge field]] configurations_ (discussed in detail below in _[Fields](#Fields)_) as being [[equality|equal]] or not. Instead it makes sense to ask if there is (or not) a _[[gauge transformation]]_ from one to the other that exibits an gauge [[equivalence]] between the two fields. The simplest example of this is described in detail below in  _[Gauge transformations in electromagnetism](#GaugeTransformationsInElectromagnetism)_.

But this means that the collection of [[gauge fields]] on a [[spacetime]] $X$, which we will write as a [[mapping space]] $[X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$, cannot be a [[smooth space]] as considered above, for if it were such a smooth space, then we could ask if two gauge fields $\nabla_1, \nabla_2 \colon * \to [X,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$ were equal or not. 

Notice that this already applies to a single gauge field: given any $\nabla \colon * \to [X,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$ it is certainly equal to itself, but is nevertheless also _gauge equivalent_ to itself, but the latter it may be in several non-equivalent ways: there may be non-trivial auto-gauge transformations $\nabla \to \nabla$. Since these can be composed, are, by definition, invertible, and contain the trivial gauge transformaiton, these form a _[[group]]_, the group of auto-gauge equivalences of $\nabla$. (Groups are discussed in detail below in _[Groups](#Groups)_) If that gauge field $\nabla$ is itself the trivial gauge field, $\nabla = \nabla_0$, then this group of auto-gauge equivalences is the _[[gauge group]]_ of the given [[gauge theory]]:

$$
  G \simeq Aut(\nabla_0) \simeq \{\nabla_0 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \nabla_0\}
  \,.
$$

For this reason, the collection of _all_ gauge fields and all gauge transformations between them form something that is a [[group]] over ever fixed element, but which generalizes the notion of a group in that there are not only auto-equivalences, but also equivalences going from one element to another. Such a structure is called a _[[groupoid]]_. Gauge fields form not a [[set]] with smooth structure, a [[smooth space]], but a [[groupoid]] with smooth structure: a _[[smooth groupoid]]_. 

At least ordinary gauge fields do. More generally, the gauge princple goes further: it is in general also a mistake to assume that given two gauge transformations $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \colon \nabla_1 \to \nabla_2$ between two gauge fields, it makes good sense to ask whether they are equal or not. Again, the gauge prinicle says that we should instead ask if there is a _[[gauge-of-gauge transformation]]_ between them, that exhibits a gauge [[equivalence]] $\rho \colon \lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2$. If these gauge-of-gauge equivalences are nontrivial it would seem that gauge fields form a generalization of the notion of a [[groupoid]] called a _[[2-groupoid]]_. But in general the gauge principle goes on: we can in general never decide if two $n$-fold gauge-of-gauge transformations are actually equal, all we have is, possibly, an $(n+1)$-fold gauge transformation going between them which exhibits their gauge equivalence, this being so for all $0 \lt n \lt \infty$. One therefore says that gauge fields in general form an _[[∞-groupoid]]_ whose _[[n-morphisms]]_ are $n$-fold [[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]. These $\infty$-groupoids are also called _[[homotopy types]]_. And since at the same time there is still a notion of gauge fields varying smoothly, these are _[[smooth ∞-groupoids]]_ or _[[smooth homotopy types]]_. This is what we discuss here. 

Remarkably, the same concept appears in [[constructive mathematics]]: there it is in general wrong to consider an [[equality]] between two [[terms]] $\nabla_1, \nabla_2 \colon [X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$, instead one is to consider an explicit [[proof]] that they are equal, provide an explicit [[equivalence]] between them. Such a proof $\lambda$ is itself a [[term]], of [[identity type]], written just as before, $\lambda \colon (\nabla_1 \simeq \nabla_2)$. And, in turn, the same applies to these proofs of equivalence themselves: in [[constructive mathematics]] one demands a [[proof]] $\rho$ that two equivalences $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \colon (\nabla_1 \simeq \nabla_2)$ are equivalent, and hence a term $\rho \colon (\lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2)$ of a higher [[identity type]]. If this goes ever on, and one speak of _[[intensional type theory]]_ or _[[homotopy type theory]]_.

This remarkable matching of [[higher gauge theory]] and [[homotopy type theory]] is what drives the discussion here.

###### Motivation: Fields and gauge transformations in electromagnetism
 {#GaugeTransformationsInElectromagnetism}

The mathematical concept of _[[smooth groupoid]]_ is well familiar, in slight disguise, in basic _[[gauge theory]]_. Here we make this explicit for basic [[electromagnetism]]. For more exposition and details along these lines see
([[schreiber:bachelor thesis Eggertsson|Eggertson 14]]).

We have seen in _[The electromagnetic field strength](#ElectromagneticFieldStrength)_ that a configuration of the electromagnetic field on $\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by a [[differential 1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$, the "[[electromagnetic potential]]". It describes a field configuration with [[field strength]] Lorentz tensor (with respect to the canonical [[coordinates]] $(t, x^1, x^2, x^3) \coloneqq (x^i)_{i = 1}^4 = $ on $\mathbb{R}^4$)

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F & = \mathbf{d}A 
      \\
      & =
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
       E_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}t
       + 
      \\
      & 
       + B_1 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3
       + B_2 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1
       + B_3 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2
  \end{aligned}     
$$

with electric [[field strength]] $(E_i \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4))_{i = 1}^3$ and magnetic [[field strength]] $(B_i \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4))_{i = 1}^3$ given  that is given by the [[de Rham differential]] of $A$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F = \mathbf{d}A
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

After Maxwell it was thought that $F \in \Omega^2(\mathbb{R}^4)$ alone genuinely reflects the configuration of the electromagnetic field. But with the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] it became clear that it is indeed the potential $A$ itself that reflects the configuration of the electromagnetic field: in the presence of [[magnetic flux]] or other topoligical constraints, there can be different $A, A' $ with the _same_ $F = \mathbf{d}A = \mathbf{d}A'$ which nevertheless describe experimentally distinguishable electromagnetic field configurations. (Distinguishable by the [[Aharonov-Bohm effect]] and also to some extent by [[Dirac charge quantization]]; this is discussed at _[Circle-principal connections](#CirclePrincipalConnections)_ below.)

However, not all different gauge potentials describe different physics. The actual configuration space of electromagnetism on a [[spacetime]] $X$ is finer than $\mathbf{\Omega}^2_{cl}(X)$ but coarser than $\mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)$. And it is not quite a smooth space itself, but a _[[smooth groupoid]]_:

one finds that two electromagnetic potentials $A, A' \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$ for which there is a function $\lambda \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^4)$ such that 

$$
  A' = A + \mathbf{d}\lambda
$$

represent _different but [[equivalence|equivalent]]_ field configurations. One says that _$\lambda$ induces a [[gauge transformation]] from $A$ to $A'$_. We write $\lambda \colon A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A'$ to reflect this.

So the configuration space of electromagnetism does not just have points and coordinate systems. But it is also equipped with the information of a space of gauge transformations between any two coordinate systems laid out in it (which may be empty). 

To see what the structure of such a _smooth gauge groupoid_ should be, notice that the above defines an [[action]] of smooth functions $\lambda$ on smooth $1$-forms $A$, 


+-- {: .num_defn #ActionOfFunctionsOnForms}
###### Definition

For any $U \in $ [[CartSp]], Write $\Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$ for the set of [[differential 1-forms]] on $X \times U$ with no components along $U$, and write $C^\infty(X \times U , U(1))$ for the [[group]] of [[circle group]] valued [[smooth functions]]. There is an [[action]] of this group on the 1-forms 

$$
  \rho_U 
   \colon 
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) \times C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))
    \to
  \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)
$$

given by

$$
  \rho_U \colon (A,\lambda) \mapsto A + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda
  \,.
$$

=--

Given such an action of a [[discrete group]] on a [[set]], we might be demoted to form the [[quotient]] set $\Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)/C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$. This set contains the gauge [[equivalence classes]] of $U$-parameterized collections of electromagnetic gauge fields on $X$. But it turns out that this is too little information to correctly capture physics. For that instead we need to remember not just that two gauge fields are equivalent, but how they are equivalent. That is, we for $\lambda$ a gauge transformation from $A_1$ to $A_2$, we should have an [[equivalence]] $\lambda \colon A_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} A_2$.

###### Definition

The [[action groupoid]]

    \stackrel{\overset{t = \rho}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{s = p_1}{\longrightarrow}}
    \Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)
  )
$$

is the [[groupoid]] whose 

* [[objects]] are $U$-parameterized collections of gauge potentials $A \in \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$;

* [[morphisms]] are pairs $(A,\lambda)$ with $A$ an object and $\lambda \in C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$, with [[domain]] $A$ and [[codomain]] $A + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda$;

* [[composition]] is given by multiplication of the $\lambda$-labels in the group $C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$.

This is the discrete _gauge groupoid_ for $U$-parameterized collections of fields. It refines the _[[gauge group]]_, which is recoverd as its [[fundamental group]]:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $A_0 \coloneqq 0 \in \Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U)$ be the trivial gauge field. Then its [[automorphism group]] in the gauge groupoid of def. \ref{EMGaugeGroupoidOverU} is the group of [[circle]]-group valued functions on $U$:

$$
  \pi_1(\Omega^1_{vert}(X\times U)// C^\infty(X \times U, U(1)), A_0)
  =
  Aut(A_0)
  \simeq
  C^\infty(U,U(1))
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition, an automorphism of $A_0$ is given by a function 
$\lambda \in C^\infty(X \times U, U(1))$ such that $A_0 = A_0 + \mathbf{d}_X \lambda$. This is the case precisely if $\mathbf{d}_X \lambda = 0$, hence if $\lambda$ is contant along $X$. But a function on $X \times U$ which is constant along $X$ is canonically identified with a function on just $U$.

=--

All this data in in fact [[natural transformation|natural]] in $U$. Recall that $\Omega^1_{vert}(X \times U) = \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)(U)$ is the set of $U$-charts of the smooth moduli space $\mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)$ of smooth 1-forms on $X$. Similarly $C^\infty(X \times U) = \mathbf{C}^\infty(X)(U)$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There is a homomorphism of [[smooth spaces]] (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces})

$$
  \rho \colon \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)\times \mathbf{C}^\infty(X) \to \mathbf{\Omega}^1(X)
$$

from the product smooth space, def. \ref{ProductOfSmoothSpaces}, of the smooth moduli spaces of 1-forms and 0-forms on $X$, def. \ref{SmoothSpaceOfFormsOnSmoothSpace}, to that of smooth functions, def. \ref{SmoothSpaceOfSmoothFunctions}, whose component over $U \in $ [[CartSp]] is the action 

$$
  \rho_U \colon (A,\lambda) \mapsto  A + \mathbf{d}\lambda
$$

of def. \ref{ActionOfFunctionsOnForms}.

#### Smooth $\infty$-Groupoids 

##### Simplicial presheaves

We need structures a bit richer than just bare [[∞-groupoids]]. In generalization to [[Lie groupoid]]s, we need [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s. A useful way to encode that an $\infty$-groupoid has extra structure modeled on geometric test objects that themselves form a category $C$ is to remember the rule which for each test space $U$ in $C$ produces the $\infty$-groupoid of $U$-parameterized families of $k$-morphisms in $K$.  For instance for an [[∞-Lie groupoid]] we could test with each [[Cartesian space]] $U = \mathbb{R}^n$ and find the $\infty$-groupoids $K(U)$ of smooth $n$-parameter families of $k$-morphisms in $K$.

This data of $U$-families arranges itself into a [[presheaf]] with values in Kan complexes

$$
  K : C^{op} \to KanCplx \hookrightarrow sSet
$$

hence with values in simplicial sets. This is equivalently a [[simplicial presheaf]] of sets. The [[functor category]] $[C^{op}, sSet]$ on the [[opposite category]] of the category of test objects $C$ serves as a model for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of $\infty$-groupoids with $C$-structure.

While there are no [[higher morphism]]s in this functor 1-category that could for instance witness that two $\infty$-groupoids are not [[isomorphic]], but still [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], it turns out that all one needs in order to reconstruct _all_ these higher morphisms (up to equivalence!) is just the information of which morphisms of simplicial presheaves would become invertible if we were keeping track of higher morphism. These would-be invertible morphisms are called _weak equivalences_ and denoted $K_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} K_2$. 

For common choices of $C$ there is a well-understood way to define the weak equivalences $W \subset mor [C^{op}, sSet]$, and equipped with this information the category of simplicial presheaves becomes a _[[category with weak equivalences]]_ . There is a well-developed but somewhat intricate theory of how exactly this 1-cagtegorical data models the full higher category of structured groupoids that we are after, but for our purposes we essentially only need to work inside the [[category of fibrant objects]] of a [[model category]] structure [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|on simplicial presheaves]], which in practice amounts to the fact that we use the following three basic constructions:

1. **[[∞-anafunctor]]s** -- A morphisms $X \to Y$ between $\infty$-groupoids with $C$-structure is not just a morphism $X\to Y$ in $[C^{op}, sSet]$, but is a [[span]] of such ordinary morphisms

   $$
     \array{  
        \hat X &\to& Y
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
        \\
        X
     }
   $$

   where the left leg is a weak equivalence. This is sometimes called an _$\infty$-anafunctor_ from $X$ to $Y$.
 
1. **[[homotopy pullback]]** -- For $A \to B \stackrel{p}{\leftarrow} C$ a [[diagram]], the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] of it is the ordinary [[pullback]] in $[C^{op}, sSet]$ of a replacement diagram $A \to B \stackrel{\hat p}{\leftarrow} \hat C$, where $\hat p$ is a _good replacement_  of $p$ in the sense of the following factorization lemma.

1. **[[factorization lemma]]** -- For $p : C \to B$ a morphism in $[C^{op}, sSet]$, a _good replacement_ $\hat p : \hat C \to B$ is given by the composite vertical morphism in the ordinary [[pullback]] diagram

   $$
     \array{
       \hat C &\to& C
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
       \\
       B^{\Delta[1]} &\to& B
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       B
     }
     \,,
   $$

  where $B^{\Delta[1]}$ is the [[path object]] of $B$: 
  the simplicial presheaf that is over each $U \in C$ the
  simplicial path space $B(U)^{\Delta[1]}$.

If in the situation of prop. \ref{CEAlgebra} we choose a dual basis $\{t^a\}$ of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and let $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ be the structure constants of the Lie bracket in that basis, then the action of the differential on the basis generators is

$$

###### Proposition

Given a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, then 
a [[Lie algebra valued differential form]] on, say, 
a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, is 
equivalently a dg-algebra homomorphims

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^p)
  \longleftarrow
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \colon
  A
  \,,
$$ 

hence there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^p, \mathfrak{g})
  \simeq
  Hom_{dgAlg}(W(\mathfrak{g}), \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^p))
  \,.
$$

The form $A$ is _flat_ in that its [[curvature]] [[differential 2-form]] $F_A$ vanishes, precisely if this morphism factors through the CE-algebra. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

With a choice of basis as in remark \ref{CEAlgebraInTermsOfBasis}, then the content of prop. \ref{LieAlgValuedFormsViaDgAlgHoms} is seen in components as follows:

a dg-algebra homomorphism is first of all a homomorphism of [[graded algebras]], and since the domain $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is free as a graded algebra, such is entirely determined by what it does to the generators

$$
  \array{
    t^a, &\mapsto& A^a & \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \\ 
    r^a &\mapsto& F^a & \in \Omega^2(\mathbb{R}^n)
  }
  \,.
$$

But being a dg-algebra homomorphism, this assignment needs to respect the differentials on both sides. For the original generators this gives

$$
  \array{
    t^a &\mapsto&&&  A^a
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}}} &&&& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{d}_{dR}}}
    \\
    - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c
    + r^a
    &\mapsto&
    (- \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} A^b \wedge A^c + F^a)
    &=&
    \mathbf{d}_{dR} A^a 
  }
  \,.
$$

With this satisfied, then, by the very nature of the [[Weil algebra]],
the differential is automatically respected also on the shifted generators. This statement is the _[[Bianchi identity]]_.

###### Definition

For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\Delta^k$ for the standard $k$-[[simplex]] regarded as a [[smooth manifold]] ([[nLab:manifold with boundary|with boundary]] and [[manifold with corners|with corners]]).  

A **$k$-path** in the $\infty$-Lie algebroid $\mathfrak{a}$ is a morphism of $\infty$-Lie algebroids of the form

$$
  \Sigma \; \coloneqq \; T \Delta^k \longrightarrow \mathfrak{a}
$$ 

from the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T \Delta^k$ of the standard smooth $k$-simplex to $\mathfrak{a}$. Dually this is equivalently a [[homomorphism]] of [[dg-algebras]]

$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A $k$-path in $\mathfrak{a}$, def. \ref{kPath}, is equivalently 

1. a _flat_ $\mathfrak{a}$-[[infinity-Lie algebroid valued differential form|valued differential form]] on $\Delta^k$;

1. a [[Maurer-Cartan element]] in $\Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k)\otimes \mathfrak{a}$.

=--

The Lie integration of $\mathfrak{a}$ is essentially the [[simplicial object]] whose $k$-cells are the $d$-paths in $\mathfrak{a}$. However, in order for this to be well-behaved, it is possible and useful to restrict to $d$-paths that are sufficiently well-behaved towards the [[boundary]] of the simplex:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Regard the smooth simplex $\Delta^k$ as embedded into the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ in the standard way, and equip $\Delta^k$ with the [[metric space]] structure induced this way.

A smooth [[differential form]] $\omega$ on $\Delta^k$ is said to have **sitting instants** along the boundary if, for every $(r \lt k)$-face $F$ of $\Delta^k$ there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $U_F$ of $F$ in $\Delta^k$ such that $\omega$ restricted to $U$ is constant in the directions perpendicular to the $r$-face on its value restricted to that face.

More generally, for any $U \in $ [[CartSp]] a smooth differential form $\omega$ on $U \times\Delta^k$ is said to have sitting instants if there is $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all points $u : * \to U$ the pullback along  $(u, \mathrm{Id}) : \Delta^k \to U \times \Delta^k$ is a form with sitting instants on $\epsilon$-[[open neighbourhood|neighbourhood]]s of faces.

Smooth forms with sitting instants clearly form a sub-dg-algebra of all smooth forms. We write $\Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)$ for this sub-dg-algebra.

We write $\Omega_{si,vert}^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)$ for the further sub-dg-algebra of [[vertical differential form]]s with respect to the projection $p : U \times \Delta^k \to U$, hence the [[coequalizer]]

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U)
  \stackrel{\stackrel{p^*}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{0}{\longrightarrow}}
  \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)
  \to
  \Omega^\bullet_{si, vert}(U \times \Delta^k)  
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The dimension of the normal direction to a face depends on the dimension of the face:  there is one perpendicular direction to a codimension-1 face, and $k$ perpendicular directions to a
vertex. 

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Examples

* A smooth 0-form (a [[smooth function]]) has sitting instants on $\Delta^1$ if in a neighbourhood of the endpoints it is constant.

  A smooth function $f : U \times \Delta^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ is in $\Omega^0_{\mathrm{vert}}(U \times \Delta^1)$ if there is $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for each $u \in U$ the function $f(u,-) : \Delta^1  \simeq [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is constant on $[0,\epsilon) \coprod (1-\epsilon,1)$.

* A smooth 1-form has sitting instants on $\Delta^1$ if in a neighbourhood of the endpoints it vanishes.

* Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]], $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(X)$ be a smooth differential form. Let 

  $$
    \phi \colon \Delta^k \to X
  $$

  be a [[smooth function]] that has [[sitting instants]] as a function: towards any $j$-face of $\Delta^k$ it eventually becomes perpendicularly constant.

  Then the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] form $\phi^* \omega \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k)$ is a form with sitting instants.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The condition of sitting instants serves to make smooth differential forms not be affected by the boundaries and corners of $\Delta^k$. Notably for $\omega_j \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^{k-1})$ a collection of forms with sitting instants on the $(k-1)$-cells of a [[horn]] $\Lambda^k_i$ that coincide on adjacent boundaries, and for

$$
  p \colon \Delta^k \to \Lambda^{k-1}_i
$$

a standard piecewise smooth [[retract]], the [[pullback of differential forms|pullbacks]]

$$
  p^* \omega_i 
$$

glue to a single smooth differential form (with sitting instants) on $\Delta^k$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

That $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k)$ having sitting instants does not imply that there is a neighbourhood of the boundary of $\Delta^k$ on which $\omega$ is entirely constant. It is important for the following constructions that in the vicinity of the boundary $\omega$ is allowed to vary parallel to the boundary, just not perpendicular to it.

###### Higher Lie integration

_[[Lie integration]]_ is a process that assigns to a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ -- or more generally to an [[L-∞-algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] or [[∞-Lie algebroid]] -- a [[Lie group]] -- or more generally [[∞-Lie groupoid]] -- that is [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimally]] modeled by $\mathfrak{g}$. It is essentially the reverse operation to [[Lie differentiation]], except that there are in general several objects Lie integrating a given Lie algebraic datum, due to the fact that the infinitesimal data does not uniquely determine global topological properties.

Classically, Lie integration of [[Lie algebras]] is part of [[Lie's three theorems]], which in particular finds an unique (up to [[isomorphism]]) [[simply connected]] Lie group integrating a given finite-dimensional Lie algebra. 

One may observe that the [[simply connected]] [[Lie group]] integrating a (finite-dimensional) Lie algebra is equivalently realized as the collection of [[equivalence classes]] of [[Lie algebra valued 1-forms]] on the interval where two such are identified if they are interpolated by a _flat_ Lie-algebra valued 1-form on the [[disk]]. ([Duistermaat-Kolk 00, section 1.14](Lie+integration#DuistermaatKolk00), see also the example [below](Lie+intgeration#LieAlgebrasToLieGroups)). 

This _path method_ of Lie integration stands out as having natural generalizations to [[higher Lie theory]] ([Ševera 01](Lie+integration#Severa01)).  

In its evident generalization from [[Lie algebra valued differential forms]] to [[Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] this provides a means for Lie integration of [[Lie algebroids]] (e.g. [Crainic-Fernandes 01](Lie+integration#Crainic)).

In another direction, one may observe that [[L-∞ algebras]] are [[formal dual|formally dually]] incarnated by their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra|Chevalley-Eilenberg]] [[dg-algebras]], and that under this identification the evident generalization of the path method to [[L-∞ algebra valued differential forms]] is essentially the [[Sullivan construction]], known from [[rational homotopy theory]], applied to these dg-algebras ([Hinich 97](Lie+integration#Hinich97), [Getzler 04](Lie+integration#Getzler04)). Or rather, the bare such construction gives the [[geometrically discrete ∞-groupoid|geometrically discrete]] [[∞-group]] underlying what should be the Lie integration to a [[smooth ∞-group]]. This is naturally obtained, as in the classical case, by suitably smoothly parameterizing the [[∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] ([Henriques 08](Lie+integration#Henriques), [Roytenberg 09](Lie+integration#Roytenberg09), [FSS 12](Lie+integration#FSS12)).

Both these directions may be combined via the evident concept of [[∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] to yield a Lie integration of [[∞-Lie algebroids]] to [[smooth ∞-groupoids]].

While the construction exists and behaves as expected in examples, there is to date no good general theory providing higher analogs of, say, [[Lie's three theorems]]. But people are working on it.


Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] (for instance a [[Lie algebra]], or a [[Lie algebroid]] or an [[L-∞-algebra]]). 

For $\mathfrak{a}$ an $\infty$-Lie algebroid, the $d$-paths in $\mathfrak{a}$ naturally form a [[simplicial set]] as $d$ varies:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \exp(\mathfrak{a})_{bare}
    & \coloneqq
    \left(
     \cdots    
     Hom_{\infty LieAlgd}(T \Delta^2, \mathfrak{a})
     \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
     Hom_{\infty LieAlgd}(T \Delta^1, \mathfrak{a})
     \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
     Hom_{\infty LieAlgd}(T \Delta^0, \mathfrak{g})
    \right)
     \\
    & =
   (
   \cdots 
   Hom_{dgAlg}(CE(\mathfrak{a}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^2))
   \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
   Hom_{dgAlg}(CE(\mathfrak{a}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^1))
   \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
   Hom_{dgAlg}(CE(\mathfrak{a}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^0))
   )
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

(We are indicating only the face maps, not the degeneracy maps, just for notational simplicity).

If here instead of smooth differential forms one uses [[polynomial differential forms]] then this is precisely the [[Sullivan construction]] of [[rational homotopy theory]] applied to $CE(\mathfrak{a})$. We next realize [[smooth structure]]  on this and hence realize this as an object in [[higher Lie theory]].



We now discuss Lie integration of $\infty$-Lie algebroids to [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s, [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc}$ over the [[site]] [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$.

Compared to the integration to [[discrete ∞-groupoids]] [above](#IntToBareGrpd) this definition knows about $U$-parametrized _smooth families_ of $k$-paths in $\mathfrak{g}$.

Observe that the standard [[continuous function|continuous]] [[horn]] [[retracts]] $f : \Delta^k \to \Lambda^k_i$ are [[smooth function|smooth]] away from the preimages of the $(r \lt k)$-faces of $\Lambda[k]^i$.

For $\omega \in \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Lambda[k]^i)$ a differential form with sitting instants on $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods, let therefore $K \subset \partial \Delta^k$ be the set of points of distance $\leq \epsilon$ from any subface. Then we have a smooth function 

$$
  f : \Delta^k \setminus K \to \Lambda^k_i \setminus K

$$

The [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] $f^* \omega \in \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k \setminus K)$ may be extended constantly back to a form with sitting instants on all of $\Delta^k$. 

The resulting assignment

$$
  (CE(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{A}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Lambda^k_i))
  \mapsto
  (CE(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{A}{\to} \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Lambda^k_i) \stackrel{f^*}{\to} \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times \Delta^n))

###### Interating Lie algebras to Lie groups

Let $\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty$ be an ordinary (finite dimensional) [[Lie algebra]]. Standard [[Lie theory]] (see [[Lie's three theorems]]) provides a [[simply connected]] [[Lie group]] $G$ integrating $\mathfrak{g}$.

With $G$ regarded as a [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth ∞-group]] write $\mathbf{B}G \in $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for its [[delooping]]. The standard presentation of this on $[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]$ is by the [[simplicial presheaf]]

###### Proposition

The operation of [[parallel transport]] $P \exp(\int -) : \Omega^1([0,1], \mathfrak{g}) \to G$ yields a weak equivalence (in $[CartSp^{op}, sSet]_{proj}$)

$$
  P \exp(\int - )

   \mathbf{cosk}_2 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \simeq \mathbf{B}G_c

This follows from the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]] and the following observation.

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[simply connected]] [[smooth manifold]] and $x_0 \in X$ a basepoint, there is a canonical [[bijection]]

$$
  \Omega^1_{flat}(X,\mathfrak{g}) \simeq C^\infty_*(X,G)
$$

between the set of [[Lie-algebra valued 1-form]]s on $X$ whose [[curvature]] 2-form vanishes, and the set of [[smooth function]]s $X\to G$ that take $x_0$ to the neutral element $e \in G$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The bijection is given as follows. For $A \in \Omega^1_{flat}(X,\mathfrak{g})$ a flat 1-form, the corresponding function $f_A : X \to G$ sends $x \in X$ to the [[parallel transport]] along any path $x_0 \to x$ from the base point to $x$

$$
  f_A : x \mapsto tra_A(x_0 \to x)
  \,.
$$

Because of the assumption that the [[curvature]] 2-form of $A$ vanishes and the assumption that $X$ is [[simply connected]], this assignment is independent of the choice of path.

Conversely, for every such function $f : X \to G$ we recover $A$ as the pullback of the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] on $G$

$$
  A = f^* \theta
  \,.
$$

=--

From this we obtain

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the proposition

The $\infty$-groupoid $\mathbf{cosk}_2 \exp(\mathfrak{g})$ is equivalent to the [[groupoid]] with a single object (no non-trivial 1-form on the point) whose morphisms are equivalence classes of smooth based paths $\Delta^1 \to G$ (with sitting instants), where two of these are taken to be equivalent if there is a smooth [[homotopy]] $D^2 \to G$ (with sitting instant) between them.

Since $G$ is [[simply connected]], these equivalence classes are labeled by the endpoints of these paths, hence are canonically identified with $G$.

###### Remark

We do not need to fall back to classical [[Lie theory]] to obtain $G$ in the above argument. A detailed discussion of how to find $G$ with its group structure and smooth structure from $d$-paths in $\mathfrak{g}$ is in ([Crainic](#Crainic)).

For $n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 1$ write $b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$ for the [[L-∞-algebra]] whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is given by a single generator in degree $n$ and vanishing differential. We may call this the **line Lie $n$-algebra**.

The [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] underlying $\exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})$ is given by the [[Kan complex]] that in degree $k$ has the set of closed differential $n$-forms (with sitting instants) on the $k$-[[simplex]]

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The $\infty$-Lie integration of $b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$ is the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+infinity-groupoid#CircleLienGroup">line Lie n-group</a> $\mathbf{B}^{n} \mathbb{R}$. 

Moreover, with $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_{chn} \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]$ the standard presentation given under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] by the chain complex of sheaves concentrated in degree $n$ on $C^\infty(-, \mathbb{R})$ the equivalence is induced by the [[fiber integration]] of differential $n$-forms over the $n$-[[simplex]]:

$$
  \int_{\Delta^\bullet} 
   : 
  \exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^{n} \mathbb{R}_{chn}
  \,.
$$


=--



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


First we observe that the map

$$
  \int_{\Delta^\bullet}
  :
  (\omega \in \Omega^n_{si,vert,cl}(U \times \Delta^k))
  \mapsto
  \int_{\Delta^k} \omega \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})
$$ 

is a morphism of 
[[simplicial presheaves]] $\exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}_{chn}$ on [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$. Since it goes between presheaves of abelian [[simplicial group]]s by the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] it is sufficient to check that we have a morphism of [[chain complex]]es of presheaves on the corresponding [[Moore complex|normalized chain complex]]es.

The only nontrivial degree to check is degree $n$. Let $\lambda \in \Omega_{si,vert,cl}^n(\Delta^{n+1})$. The differential of the [[Moore complex|normalized chains complex]] sends this to the signed sum of its restrictions to the $n$-faces of the $(n+1)$-simplex. Followed by the integral over $\Delta^n$ this is the piecewise integral of $\lambda$ over the boundary of the $n$-simplex. Since $\lambda$ has sitting instants, there is $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that there are no contributions to this integral in an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the $(n-1)$-faces. Accordingly the integral is equivalently that over the smooth surface inscribed into the $(n+1)$-simplex, as indicated in the following diagram

Since $\lambda$ is a closed form on the $n$-simplex, this surface integral vanishes, by the [[Stokes theorem]]. Hence $\int_{\Delta^\bullet}$ is indeed a chain map.

It remains to show that $\int_{\Delta^\bullet} : \exp(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}_{chn}$ is an [[isomorphism]] on all the [[simplicial homotopy]]s group over each $U \in CartSp$. This amounts to the statement that 

1. a smooth family of closed $n$-forms with sitting instants on the boundary of $\Delta^{n+1}$ may be extended to a smooth family of closed forms with sitting instants on $\Delta^{n+1}$ precisely if their smooth family of integrals over the boundary vanishes;

1. Any smooth family of closed $n \lt k$-forms with sitting instants on the boundary of $\Delta^{k+1}$ may be extended to a smooth family of closed $n$-forms with sitting instants on $\Delta^{k+1}$.

To demonstrate this, we want to work with forms on the $(k+1)$-[[ball]] instead of the $(k+1)$-[[simplex]]. To achieve this, choose again $0 \lt \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ and construct the [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] image of $S^k \times [1,1-\epsilon]$ inside the $(k+1)$-simplex as indicated in the above diagram: outside an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the corners the image is a rectangular $\epsilon$-thickening of the faces of the simplex. Inside the $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods of the corners it bends smoothly. By the [[Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem]] the diffeomorphism from this $\epsilon$-thickening of the smoothed boundary of the simplex to $S^k \times [1-\epsilon,1]$ extends to a smooth function from the $(k+1)$-simplex to the $(k+1)$-ball. 

By choosing $\epsilon$ smaller than each of the sitting instants of the given $n$-form on $\partial \Delta^{k+1}$, we have that this $n$-form vanishes on the $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods of the corners and is hence entirely determined by its restriction to the smoothed simplex, identified with the $(k+1)$-ball.

It is now sufficient to show: a smooth family of smooth $n$-forms $\omega \in \Omega^n_{vert,cl}(U \times S^k)$ extends to a smooth family of closed $n$-forms $\hat \omega \in \Omega^n_{vert,cl}(U \times B^{k+1})$ that is radially constant in a neighbourhood of the boundary for all $n \lt k$ and for $k = n$ precisely if its smooth family of integrals vanishes, $\int_{S^k} \omega = 0 \in C^\infty(U, \mathbb{R})$.

Notice that over the point this is a direct consequence of the [[de Rham theorem]]: an $n$-form $\omega$ on $S^k$ is exact precisely if $n \lt k$  or if $n = k$ and its integral vanishes. In that case there is an $(n-1)$-form $A$ with $\omega = d A$. Choosing any smoothing function $f : [0,1] \to [0,1]$ (smooth, surjective, non,decreasing and constant in a neighbourhood of the boundary) we obtain an $n$-form $f \wedge A$ on $(0,1] \times S^k$, vertically constant in a neighbourhood of the ends of the interval, equal to $A$ at the top and vanishing at the bottom. Pushed forward along the canonical $(0,1] \times S^k \to D^{k+1}$ this defines a form on the $(k+1)$-ball, that we denote by the same symbol $f \wedge A$. Then the form $\hat \omega := d (f \wedge A)$ solves the problem.

To complete the proof we have to show that this simple argument does extend to smooth families of forms, i.e., that we can choose the $(n-1)$-form $A$ in a way depending smoothly on the the $n$-form $\omega$. 

One way of achieving this is using [[Hodge theory]]. Fix a [[Riemannian metric]] on $S^n$, and let $\Delta$ be the corresponding [[Laplace operator]], and $\pi$ the projection on the space of [[harmonic forms]]. Then the 
<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hodge+theory#ResultsOverRiemannianManifold">central result of Hodge theory</a> for [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]]s states that the operator $\pi$, seen as an operator from the 
[[de Rham complex]] to itself, is a cochain map [[homotopy|homotopic]] to the identity, via an explicit homotopy $P := d^* G$ expressed in terms of the adjoint $d^*$ of the de Rham differential and of the [[Green operator]] $G$ of $\Delta$. Since the $k$-form $\omega$ is exact its projection on [[harmonic form]]s vanishes. Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \omega & = (Id-\pi)\omega 
    \\
     & = d (P\omega)+P (d\omega)
    \\
    & = d (P\omega).
  \end{aligned}
$$

Hence $A := P\omega$ is a solution of the differential equation $d A=\omega$ depending smoothly on $\omega$.

###### Integrating the string Lie 2-algebra to the string Lie 2-group

Let $\mathfrak{string} = \mathfrak{g}_\mu$ be the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

Then $\mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g}_\mu)$ is equivalent to the [[2-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}String$ 

* with a single object;

* whose morphisms are based paths in $G$;

* whose 2-morphisms are equivalence class of pairs $(\Sigma,c)$, where 

  * $\Sigma : D^2_*  \to G$ is a smooth based map (where we use a [[homeomorphism]] $D^2 \simeq \Delta^2$ which away from the corners is smooth, so that forms with sitting instants there do not see any non-smoothness, and the basepoint of $D^2_*$ is the 0-vertex of $\Delta^2$) 

  * and $c \in U(1)$, and where two such are equivalent if the maps coincides at their boundary and if for any 3-ball $\phi : D^3 \to G$ filling them the labels $c_1, c_2 \in U(1)$ differ by the integral $\int_{D^3} \phi^* \mu(\theta) \;\; mod \;\; \mathbb{Z}$,,

where $\theta$ is the [[Maurer-Cartan form]], $\mu(\theta) = \langle \theta\wedge [\theta \wedge \theta]\rangle $ the 3-form obtained by plugging it into the cocycle.

This is the [[string Lie 2-group]]. It's construction in terms of integration by paths is due to ([Henriques](#Henriques))
