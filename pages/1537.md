__Gribov ambiguity__ is a common problem in [[gauge fixing]] procedure, namely the unique and continuous choice of a representative of each gauge orbit is often impossible globally. In particular most common gauge fixing procedures have this problem. Gribov introduced what is now called __Gribov regions__ and their boundaries, __Gribov horizons__.
