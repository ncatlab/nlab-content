
## In superalgebra

In the context of [[superalgebra]], the the ideal of a superalgebra generated by its odd part is called its _soul_.

The [[quotient]] by that ideal is called the _[[body]]_.

See at _[superalgebra -- Adjoints to inclusion of plain algebras](super+algebra#AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra)_.

This terminology is (for the special case of [[Grassmann algebras]] at least) due to [DeWitt 92, p. 1](#DeWitt92)
