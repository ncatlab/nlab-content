## Idea

An **abelian sheaf** is a [[sheaf]] with values in an [[abelian category]] which usually is itself, or is taken to be embedded in, a category of [[complex]]es in an [[abelian category]].

In light of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] this means that abelian sheaves can usefully be regarded as special cases of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] and in particular the corresponding [[derived category]] of abelian sheaves, traditionally mainly investigated in terms of [[sheaf cohomology]], is analogous to the [[homotopy category]] of abelian [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]]. In this way, via [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan]], plain abelian sheaves already go a long way towards (abelian) [[Higher Topos Theory]], which is one way of understanding the relevance of the concept of abelian sheaves.

For instance [[Deligne cohomology]], which classifies higher abelian [[gerbe]]s (certain [[infinity-stack]]s) with [[connection]]), is the [[sheaf cohomology]] of a certain class of sheaves with values in abelian complexes. This is understood conceptually by realizing that after embedding complexes of abelian sheaves -- via [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan]] -- into  general [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial sheaves]], a complex of abelian sheaves becomes an abelian $\infty$-prestack and the computation of its [[sheaf cohomology]] corresponds to passing to its [[infinity-stackification]].
