## Idea

On the one hand, there is [[internal language|syntax]].  On the other hand, there is [[structure|semantics]].  Model theory is (roughly) about the relations between the two: model theory studies classes of [[models]] of [[theories]], hence classes of "[[structures in model theory|mathematical structures]]".

A model theory for a particular [[logic]] typically works within a given [[universe]], and specifies a notion of "[[mathematical structure]]" in this context, namely a _[[structure in model theory|structure for a language]]_, and a _[[definition]] of [[truth]]_. Logic is typically specified by [[signature (in logic)|language]] (function symbols, relations symbols and constants); formulas (formed from symbols, [[variables]], Boolean operations and [[quantifiers]]). Language together with a choice of a set of formulas without [[free variables]] (viewed as [[axioms]]) is called a [[theory]]. A structure is an interpretation of a language $L$ via a given set $M$ together with interpretation of the symbols of the language. A __[[model]]__ of a [[theory]] $\mathcal{T}$ in the language $L$ is an [[structure in model theory|L-structure]] which satisfies each formula in $\mathcal{T}$. 

The two main problems of model theory are

* classification of a given theory $\mathcal{T}$ in a language $L$
* study the family of all [[definable sets]] of a [[structure (in model theory)|structure]] $M$ of a [[language (in model theory)|language]] $L$

In all memorable examples, the collection of structures for a language will form an interesting [[category]] (see [Beke-Rosicky 11](#BekeRosicky11) for a characterization of these), and the subcollection of those structures verifying a given collection $Th$ of [[propositions]] in the language are an interesting [[subcategory]] again.

Model theory as currently conceived has strong analogies with the classical theory of [[algebraic varieties]] and hence with the part of [[algebraic geometry]] that deals with these. One such analogy is that [[definable subsets]] are likened to [[zero loci]] of [[equations]], and another consists of various notions of [[dimension]] which can be likened to Krull dimension. One can also say that classical algebraic geometry often provides a testing ground for more general developments in model theory. (For the most part, model theory does not deal however with more global concepts of modern algebraic geometry such as [[sheaves]] or [[schemes]].) 

## Scope
 {#Scope}

In full generality, _model theory_ would study all kinds of [[models]] over all kinds of [[theories]], hence pretty much everything that is considered (in) [[mathematics]]. However, in order to find effective classification results for models, one traditionally restricts attention to very special kinds of theories only. 

Traditionally the default subject of model theory (e.g. ([Hodges 93](#Hodges93))) are [[first-order theories]] (only) and their models in [[Set]] (only), these are the traditional [[structures in model theory]]. For emphasis the study of this specific case is also called _first-order model theory_ or _classical model theory_ ([SEP](#SEPEntry)). Among the fundamental classfication theorems provable in this context are the [[compactness theorem]] and the [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]]. (See also _[[geometric stability theory]]_.)

More modern developments in model theory consider also wider classes of [[theories]] than just [[first-order theories]] (e.g [Tent-Ziegler 12](#TentZiegler12)). In particular there is [categorical model theory](#CategoricalModelTheory) ([Makkai-Paré 89](#MakkaiPare89), [Beke-Rosicky 11](#BekeRosicky11)).

## Examples

Classical model theory is concerned with models of [[theories]] in [[first-order logic]], this is what we discuss first, below in 

* [First-order logic](#FirstOrderLogic).

More generally one can consider models over theories in [[higher-order logic]], this we discuss below in

* [Higher-order logic](#HigherOrderLogic).

### Classical Model theory in First-order logic
 {#FirstOrderLogic}

+-- {: .standout}
**Caveat Lector.**
This may duplicate/contradict other nLab accounts of [[FOL]], e.g. [[theory]]; it is present here for illustrative purposes only.  We attempt to obviate the trouble of quantifier scope by using _addressing_ rather than _naming_ of variables; specifically, the variable $x_n$ occurs _bound_ in a formula if it is nested within more than $n$ quantifiers, and otherwise _free_.
=--

We describe an [[operad]] $L$ in [[Set]] over two [[type]]s, $W$ and $P$ for "words" and "propositions", respectively.  The full operad is freely generated by various disjoint suboperads

* a free suboperad $O$ of operations, or functions, of types $W^n\to W$;
* an $\mathbb{N}$-indexed suboperad $X$ of variables of types $1\to W$;
* a (free) suboperad $R$ of predicates, or relations, of types $W^n\to P$;
* the equality operad, of type $W^2\to P$
* the boolean operad, $B$: it's got $\wedge, \vee,\neg,\dots$ of types $P^{k}\to P$ for $k=1,2$, and perhaps $k=0$ if you want to include $\bot$; these compose the way you think they should.
* the quantifier $\forall:$, usually written $\forall x_j$, where $x_j\in X_0$; \forall is of type $P\to P$.

Notable subsets of $L$ include $O[X]$, generated by $O\cup X$, the suboperad of parametrized words, and $R[X]$, the elements of types $? \to P$ in the suboperad generated by $O,R,X$.

Abusively, an  _$L$-structure_, or _interpretation_ of the functions and relations is an [[algebra over an operad|algebra]] $(W,P,O,R)\mapsto (M,2,O_M,R_M)$ for the suboperad $Q$ of $L$ generated by $O\cup R$ with the type $P$ interpreted by the initial [[boolean algebra]] $2$.

The _Tarski Definition of Truth_ is a [[functor|natural]] extension of the $Q$-algebra $M$ to an $L$-algebra, $(M,\dots)$ such that
* for $\Phi$ in $R[X]$ and for all functions $m:X\to M$, the sensible thing $\Phi[m]$ is true in $M$.
* $\Phi \wedge \Theta$ is true if for all functions $m:X\to M$, both $\Phi[m]$ and $\Theta[m]$ are true, and $\neg \Phi$ is true if and only if $\Phi$ is _not_.
* $(\forall:\Phi)[m]$ is true in $M$ precisely when $\Phi[m_a]$ is true for all $a\in M$, where
$$m_a(x_i) = \left\{ \array{ a & i=0 \\ m(x_{i-1}) & else }\right. $$

(Again, this really should be written more clearly, but it's a start.)

+-- {: .query}
[[JCMcKeown]]: is there some nicer way to say the quantifier nonsense? I'm thinking along the lines
> there are two actions of $\mathbb{N}$ on $L$: one shifts all the variables by 1, the other adds a $\forall$ quantifier; and the Tarski extension is the one that makes these commute somehow

_ibid_: maybe it's more right to say that $P_M$ should be the boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(|M|^\mathbb{N})$? This again has that natural action of $\mathbb{N}$ on it...

#### Definition and remarks
{: #definition+theory+and+model+fol}

An $L$-structure $M$, as an $L$-algebra with extra properties, defines a **complete first-order theory** $Th(M)$, that subset of $L$ which $M$ interprets as $\top\in 2$, or _true_.  Conversely, given a collection $T$ of elements of $L$ of type $?\to P$, we say that $M\models T$, or in words $M$ **is a model of the theory** $T$ whenever $T\subset Th(M)$.  There is an obvious Galois connection between theories $T$ and the collections of $L$-structures that are models.  Much of deeper model theory studies the fine structure of this connection.

### Operads, Monads and Lawvere theories
 {#OperadsMonadsAndLawvereTheories}

Structures from [[universal algebra]], [[higher algebra]] and [[categorical logic]] that conveniently allow tospeak about [[theories]] and their [[models]] are [[operads]], [[monads]] and [[Lawvere theories]]. Each of these may be understood as characterizing a [[theory]]. Its [[models]] then are the corresponging algebras, see at _[[algebra over an operad]]_, _[[algebra over a monad]]_ and _[[algebra over a Lawvere theory]]_, respectively.


### Higher-order logic
 {#HigherOrderLogic}

Remaining within [[Set]], we can also generalize beyond first-order logic to various [[higher-order logic|higher-order logics]].

((insert your favourite variant here))


### Infinitary logic and Categorical model theory
 {#CategoricalModelTheory}

For a reasonable fragment of [[infinitary logic]], then the [[category]] of all [[models]] over [[theories]] in this [[language]] is an [[accessible category]] and moreover all accessible categories arise this way. ([Makkai-Pare 89](#MakkaiPare89), [Beke-Rosicky 11](#BekeRosicky11)).
 

## Important theorems

The following are closely interrelated, and depend on having a suitable universe $V$.  We can view them as theorems of $ZFC$ or as (relatively mild) conditions on $V$.

*(... clarify ...)*

###### Goedel completeness theorem

Given a first-order theory $T$ in some language $L$, $T$ is consistent iff there is a model of $T$ in $V$ --- that is, iff $M\models T$ for some $M\in V$.

See at _[[completeness theorem]]_.

###### Goedel's compactness theorem

Under the same hypotheses, $T$ is consistent iff every finite subset of $T$ is consistent; expressed semantically, a theory $T$ has a model iff every finite subset of $T$ has a model.

See at _[[compactness theorem]]_.

###### Łoś ultraproduct theorem

*(...think of a good way to state this...)*

##### Corollaries worth thinking about

It follows that first-order theories are quite permissive; or in other words that they're inefficient at pinning down particular structures.

For example, consider the complete first-order theory $Th(V_\omega,\in)$, and any total order $(X,\lt)$.  If one *expands* the language (coresponding to an injective morphism of operads) to include constant symbols $c_x$ for $x\in X$, then for any  subset $s$ of $X$ of finite size $n + 1$, one has 
$$(V_\omega,\in,0,1,\cdots,n)\models Th(V_\omega,\in)\cup \{c_x\in c_y \mid x\lt y;x,y\in s\}$$
so that the *finite extensions* of $Th(V_\omega,\in)$ by suborders of $X$ are all consistent; by compactness, the fully extended theory $Th(V_\omega,\in)\cup \{c_x\in c_y \mid x\lt y;x,y\in X\}$ is also consistent; thus by completeness there is a structure $(M,\epsilon,\cdots,c_x,\cdots)$ such that
*  $(M,\epsilon)\models Th(V_\omega,\in)$
*  $c_x\epsilon c_y$ for all $x\lt y$ in $X$

By a similar argument, (if ZFC is consistent) there are models $M'$ of classical set theory satisfying the (higher-order) property that the natural numbers object $\omega_{M'}$ of $M'$ includes your favourite total order $(X,\lt)$ *as a suborder* --- of course, $M'$ isn't allowed to *know* this --- notably, there is **no object** $\xi$ in $M$ such that $\{y\mid y\epsilon \xi\} = \{c_x \mid x\in X\}$.
