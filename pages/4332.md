## Idea

In [[physics]] there are (at least) two different concepts that go by the name **gauge group**:

* a _local gauge group_ $G$ is a structure group of of $G$-[[principal bundle]]s in the configuration space of a classical [[gauge theory]];

* a _global gauge group_ is a group of [[automorphism]]s that acts on the ([[local net]] of) [[observable]]s of a [[quantum field theory]].

Notably after [[quantization]] the gauge group in the first sense does _not_ become a gauge group in the second sense. On the contrary, observables in quantum field theory are required _not_ to depend on gauge transformations in the first sense, and part of what makes quantization of [[gauge theory]] nontrivial is to find among all potentiall candidate observables those that actually are invariant under gauge transformations, i.e. under isomorphisms of [[principal bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] in the configuration space of the gauge theory.

## Global gauge group

The concept of gauge groups is most prominent in [[quantum field theory]], where the gauge group of a [[physical system]] is the [[group]] of transformations of the mathematical model of the system that do not correspond to any measurable [[physics|physical]] effects. In this sense, nontrivial gauge groups arise from redundancies of the mathematical description. Gauge groups are a central ingredient of [[gauge theories]]. 

In  [[AQFT]] gauge groups are introduced via a [[net of C-star-systems]].

## Local gauge groups

In [[Yang-Mills theory]] and other [[gauge theories]] the _gauge groups_ is the structure group $G$ of the $G$-[[principal bundle]] on which the [[Yang-Mills field]] is a [[connection on a bundle|connection]].

Local gauge groups are are visible in the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] approach to [[quantum field theory]], where they act on the configuration space on which the [[action functional]] is a function. A large machinery has been developed to handle the ([[path integral]]) [[quantization]] of [[action functional]]s on such configuration spaces. See for instance [[BV-BRST formalism]].
