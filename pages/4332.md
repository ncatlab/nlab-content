## Idea

The concept of gauge groups is most prominent in [[quantum field theory]], where the gauge group of a [[physical system]] is the [[group]] of transformations of the mathematical model of the system that do not correspond to any measurable [[physics|physical]] effects. In this sense, nontrivial gauge groups arise from redundancies of the mathematical description. Gauge groups are a central ingredient of [[gauge theories]]. In particular, in the more strict sense of the word, in [[Yang-Mills theory]] the _gauge groups_ is the structure group $G$ of the $G$-[[principal bundle]] on which the [[Yang-Mills field]] is a [[connection on a bundle|connection]].

Gauge groups are usually introduced using the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] approach to [[quantum field theory]] (see, for example, Wikipedia), but the concept exists in different approaches like [[AQFT]] too, of course. In the latter case the gauge group is introduced via a [[net of C-star-systems]].
