## Idea ##
The concept of gauge groups is most prominent in [[quantum field theory]], the gauge group of a physical system is the group of transformations of the mathematical model of the system that do not correspond to any measurable effects. In this sense nontrivial gauge groups arise from redundancies of the mathematical description. Gauge groups are a central ingredient of [[gauge theories]].

Gauge groups are usually introduced using the Lagrangian approach to [[quantum field theory]] (see, for example, Wikipedia), but the concept exists in different approaches like [[AQFT]] too, of course. In the latter case the gauge group is introduced via a [[net of C-star systems]].
