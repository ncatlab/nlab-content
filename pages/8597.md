__Mitsuhiro Takeuchi__ is a Japanese algebraist. Much of his work is dedicated to bialgebras, Hopf algebras, coalgebras, (co)module algebras, [[Hopf-Galois extension]]s and various generalizations of these concepts as well as applications of bialgebras to the theory of algebraic and formal groups and quotients.

He introduced left adjoint to the forgetful functor from Hopf algebras to coalgebras and (by composing) also to the forgetful functor to vector spaces ([[free Hopf algebra]] functor), together with a first example of a Hopf algebra with non-bijective antipode in
