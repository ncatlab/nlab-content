## Idea

A _Reedy category_ is a category $R$ equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape $R$.  

The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on $R$ is the existence of a [[model category|model structure]] on the [[functor category]] $M^R$ whenever $M$ is a model category (no extra hypotheses on $M$ are required): the 

* [[Reedy model structure]] .

## Definition

A **Reedy category** is a [[category]] $R$ equipped with two [[wide subcategory|lluf subcategories]] $R_+$ and $R_-$ and a [[function]] $d:ob(R) \to \alpha$ called _degree_, where $\alpha$ is an [[ordinal number]], such that:

* Every nonidentity morphism in $R_+$ raises degree,
* Every nonidentity morphism in $R_-$ lowers degree, and
* Every morphism $f$ in $R$ factors uniquely as a map in $R_-$ followed by a map in $R_+$.


## Examples

* Any ordinal $\alpha$, considered as a [[poset]] and hence a category, is a Reedy category with $\alpha_+=\alpha$, $\alpha_-$ the [[discrete category]] on $ob(\alpha)$, and $d$ the identity.

* The [[opposite category|opposite]] of any Reedy category is a Reedy category; simply exchange $R_+$ and $R_-$.

* [[Theta category|Joyal's category]] $\Theta$ is also a Reedy category.

* Many very small categories of diagram shapes are Reedy categories, such as $(\cdot\to\cdot\to \dots)$, or $(\cdot\leftarrow \cdot\rightarrow\cdot)$, or $(\cdot\rightrightarrows\cdot)$.  This is of importance for the construction of [[homotopy limits]] and colimits over such diagram shapes.


### The simplex category

The prototypical examples of Reedy categories are the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ and its opposite $\Delta^{op}$.  More generally, for any [[simplicial set]] $X$, its [[category of simplices]] $\Delta/X$ is a Reedy category.

The Reedy category structure on $\Delta$ is a follows

* a map $[k] \to [n]$ is in $\Delta_+$ precisely if it is injective;

* a map $[n] \to [k]$ is in $\Delta_-$ precisely if it is surjective.

## Related notions

### Direct and inverse categories

A Reedy category in which $R_-$ contains only identities is called a [[direct category]]; the factorization axiom then says simply that $R=R_+$.  Similarly, if $R_+$ contains only identities it is said to be an [[inverse category]].

Any ordinal is of course a direct category, and so is the subcategory $R_+$ of any Reedy category considered as a category in its own right.  This amounts to "discarding the degeneracies" in a shape category.  In some examples there are no degeneracies to begin with, such as the category of [[opetopes]]; thus these are naturally direct categories.

### Generalized Reedy category 

One problem with the notion of Reedy category is that it is [[evil]]: it is not invariant under [[equivalence of categories]].  It's not hard to see that any Reedy category is necessarily skeletal.  In fact, it's even worse: no Reedy category can have _any_ nonidentity isomorphisms!  This is problematic for many $\Delta$-like categories such as the [[category of cycles]], Segal's category $\Gamma$, the [[tree category]] $\Omega$, and so on.  The concept of 

* [[generalized Reedy category]],

due to [[Clemens Berger]] and [[Ieke Moerdijk]], avoids these problems.  There is a similar generalization due to [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]].

### Elegant Reedy categories

The notion of [[elegant Reedy category]], introduced by [[Julie Bergner]] and [[Charles Rezk]], is a *restriction* of the notion which captures the property that the Reedy model structure and injective model structure coincide.  Several important Reedy categories are elegant, such as the $\Delta$ and $\Theta$.

### Enriched Reedy category 

There is also a generalization of the notion of Reedy category to the context of [[enriched category theory]]: this is an [[enriched Reedy category]].
