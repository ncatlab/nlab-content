## Idea

Weak bialgebra (resp. weak Hopf algebra) is a generalization of a bialgebra (Hopf algebra) in which the comultiplication $\Delta$ is weak in the sense that $\Delta(1)\neq 1\otimes 1$ in general. 

#### Physical motivation

This kind of structures naturally comes in CFT models relation to quantum groups a root of unity: the full symmetry algebra is not quite a quantum group at root of unity, because if it were one would have to include the nonphysical quantum dimension zero finite-dimensional quantum group representations into the (pre)Hilbert space; those are the zero norm states which do not contribute to physics (like ghosts). If one quotients by these states then the true unit of a quantum group becomes an idempotent (projector), hence one deals with weak Hopf algebras instead as a price of dealing with true, physical, Hilbert space.

## Literature

Weak comultiplications were introduced in

* G. Mack, V. Schomerus, _Quasi Hopf quantum symmetry in quantum theory_, Nucl. Phys. B370(1992) 185.

where also weak quasi-bialgebras are considered and physical motivation is discussed in detail. Further work in this vain is in

Phys. __35__ (1996) 437--456, [arXiv:q-alg/9509008](http://arxiv. rg/abs/q-alg/9509008); _Weak $C*$-Hopf algebras: the coassociative symmetry of non-integral dimensions_, in: Quantum groups and quantum spaces (Warsaw, 1995), 9-19, Banach Center Publ. __40__, Polish Acad.
