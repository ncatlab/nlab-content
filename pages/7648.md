## Idea

The notion of _weak bialgebra_ is a generalization of that of  [[bialgebra]] in which the comultiplication $\Delta$ is weak in the sense that $\Delta(1)\neq 1\otimes 1$ in general;
similarly the compatibility of counit with the multiplication
map is weakened (counit might fail to be a morphism of algebras). (Still a special case of [[sesquialgebra]].)

Correspondingly [[weak Hopf algebras]] generalize [[Hopf algebras]] accordingly. Every weak Hopf algebra defines a
[[Hopf algebroid]]. 

### Physical motivation

This kind of structures naturally comes in [[CFT]] models relation to quantum groups a root of unity: the full symmetry algebra is not quite a quantum group at root of unity, because if it were one would have to include the nonphysical quantum dimension zero finite-dimensional quantum group representations into the (pre)Hilbert space; those are the zero norm states which do not contribute to physics (like ghosts). If one quotients by these states then the true unit of a quantum group becomes an idempotent (projector), hence one deals with weak Hopf algebras instead as a price of dealing with true, physical, Hilbert space.

## Definitions

A __weak bialgebra__ is a tuple $(A,\mu,\eta,\Delta,\epsilon)$
such that $(A,\mu,\eta)$ is an associative unital algebra,
$(A,\Delta,\epsilon)$ is a coassociative counital coalgebra
and the following compatibilities hold:

(i) the coproduct $\Delta$ is multiplicative $\Delta(x)\Delta(y)= \Delta(x y)$

(ii) the counit $\epsilon$ satisfies weak multiplicativity
$$
\epsilon(x y z) = \epsilon(x y_{(1)})\epsilon(y_{(2)} z),
$$
$$
\epsilon(x y z) = \epsilon(x y_{(2)})\epsilon(y_{(1)} z).
$$

(iii) Weak comultiplicativity of the unit:

$$
\Delta^{(2)} (1) = (\Delta(1) \otimes 1)(1\otimes \Delta(1))
$$
$$
\Delta^{(2)} (1) = (1 \otimes\Delta(1))(\Delta(1) \otimes 1)
$$

As usually in the context of coassociative coalgebras, we denoted $\Delta^{(2)} := (id\otimes\Delta)\Delta = 
(\Delta\otimes id)\Delta$.

A weak $k$-bialgebra $A$ is a __weak Hopf algebra__ if it has a $k$-linear map $S:A\to A$ (which is then called an antipode)
such that for all $x\in A$
$$
x_{(1)} S(x_{(2)}) = \epsilon(1_{(1)} x)1_{(2)},
$$
$$
S(x_{(1)})x_{(2)} = 1_{(1)} \epsilon(x 1_{(2)}),
$$
$$
S(x_{(1)})x_{(2)} S(x_{(3)}) = S(x)
$$

## Properties

### Idempotents ("projections")

For every weak bialgebra there are $k$-linear maps 
$\Pi^L,\Pi^R:A\to A$
with properties $\Pi^R\Pi^R = \Pi^R$ and $\Pi^L\Pi^L = \Pi^L$
and defined by
$$
\Pi^L(x) := \epsilon(1_{(1)} x) 1_{(2)},\,\,\,\,
\Pi^R(x) := 1_{(1)}\epsilon(x 1_{(2)}).
$$
These expressions are already met above in two of the axioms for the antipode.
Then $\epsilon(x z) = \epsilon(x 1 z)  = \epsilon(x 1_({2}))\epsilon(1_{(1)}z)) = \epsilon(x \epsilon(1_{(1)}z))1_{(2)} = \epsilon(x\Pi^L(z)) = \epsilon(\Pi^R(x)z)$. 
The images of the idempotents $A^R = \Pi^R(A)$ and $A^L = \Pi^L(R)$ are dual as $k$-linear spaces: there
is a canonical nondegenerate pairing $A^L\otimes A^R\to k$ 
given by $(x,y) \mapsto \epsilon(y x)$.

Also $\Pi^L(x\Pi^L(y)) = \Pi^L(x y)$ 
 and $\Pi^R(\Pi^R(x)y) = \Pi^R(x y)$,
 and dually $\Delta(A^L)\subset A\otimes A^L$ 
        and $\Delta(A^R)\subset A^R\otimes A$,
 and $\Delta(1)\in A^R\otimes A^L$.


### Relation to fusion categories

Under [[Tannaka duality]] (semisimple) weak Hopf algebras correspond to (multi-)[[fusion categories]] ([Ostrik](#Ostrik)).

## Literature

Weak comultiplications were introduced in

where also weak quasi-bialgebras are considered and physical motivation is discussed in detail. Further work in this vain is in
