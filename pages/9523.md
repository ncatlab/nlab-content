## Idea

There are several natural generalizations of the notion of [[C-star-algebra]] whic allow the [[linear operators]] involved to be not necessarily [[bounded operators]]. (See [Bagarello](#Bagarello) for a list of literature.) Some variant of these are called _F-star-algebras_, short for _Fr√©chet-[[star algebra]]_.
