## Idea

In the context of _[[electromagnetism]]_ Kirchhoff's laws are a kind of coarse-grained form of [[Maxwell's equations]]. Where the latter deal with [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] quantities, Kirchhoff's law involve macroscopic [[current]] and [[voltage]] in electrical [[circuits]]. 

One speaks of two laws, 

1. the _Kirchhoff voltage law_ (abbreviated KVL)

1. the _Kirchhoff current law_ (abbreviated KCL)

The derivation of these two laws from [[Maxwell's equations]] is spelled out for instance in lecture 7 ([here](#Lecture)).

Nevertheless, Kirchhoff's laws preserve the [[cohomology|cohomological]] nature of Maxwell's equations: where the latter involves [[de Rham cohomology]] and hence "infinitesimal cochains", Kirchhoff's laws can neatly be formulated in terms of [[cochain on a simplicial set|cochains on finite cell complexes]]. (See for instance appendix B of [Frankel](#Frankel)).
