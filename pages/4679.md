## Idea

The _orthogonal Lie algebra_ $\mathfrak{o}$ is the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O$.

The _special orthogonal Lie algebra_ is the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}$ of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO$. 

Since the two [[Lie group]]s differ by an discrete group $\mathbb{Z}_2$, these two Lie algebras coincide; we traditionally write $\mathfrak{so}$ instead of $\mathfrak{o}$.


## Properties

### In the classification of Lie algebras

For $n \gt 2$, $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is a [[simple Lie algebra]], either $\mathfrak{d}_{n/2}$ when $n$ is even or $\mathfrak{b}_{(n-1)/2}$ when $n$ is odd.  For $n = 2$, $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is the [[line]], an [[abelian Lie algebra]], which is also a [[simple object]] in [[LieAlg]] but is not counted as a simple Lie algebra.  For $n \lt 2$, $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is the [[trivial Lie algebra]] (which is [[too simple to be simple]] by any standard).

### Relation to Clifford algebra

For $V$ an [[inner product space]], 
the special orthogonal Lie algebra on $V$ is naturally isomorphism to the algebra of [[bivectors]] in the [[Clifford algebra]] $Cl(V)$ under the Clifford [[commutator]] bracket.
