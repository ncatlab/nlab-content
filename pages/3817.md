
**Ludvig Dmitrievich Faddeev** (Russian: Людвиг Дмитриевич Фаддеев, translit. Ljudvig Dmitrievič Faddeev) is a Russian theoretical physicist, academician (and many years secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences), son of the algebraist D. K. Faddeev. With Popov he invented a remarkable method in quantization of [[gauge theories]], i.e. in the evaluation of Feynman [[path integrals]] with gauge degrees of freedom (Faddeev-Popov method). With B. S. Pavlov, Fadeev has applied the [[abstract scattering theory]] to the study of [[automorphic function]]s. Faddeev is one of the pioneers of the Leningrad (St. Petersburg) school of [[integrable systems]] and [[quantum inverse scattering method]] which also lead to the discovery of [[quantum groups]].
