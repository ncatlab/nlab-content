## Idea

A filtered category is a [[categorification]] of the concept of [[directed set]].  In addition to having an upper bound (but not necessarily a [[coproduct]]) for every pair of objects, there must also be an upper bound (but not necessarily a [[coequaliser]]) for every pair of parallel morphisms.

A [[diagram]] $F:D\to C$ where $D$ is a filtered category is called a **filtered diagram**.  A colimit of a filtered diagram is called a **[[filtered colimit]]**.

A category whose opposite is filtered is called **cofiltered**.


## Definitions

A **(finitely) filtered category** (sometimes called a **filtrant category**, as for instance in Kashiwara--Schapira\'s book [[Categories and Sheaves]]) is a [[category]] $C$ in which any finite diagram has a [[cocone]].  That is, for any finite category $D$ and any functor $F:D\to C$, there exists an object $c\in C$ and a natural transformation $F\to \Delta c$ where $\Delta c:D\to C$ is the constant diagram at $c$.

Equivalently, filtered categories can be characterized as those categories where, for every finite diagram $J$, the diagonal functor $\Delta : C \to C^J$ is [[final functor|final]]. This point of view can be generalized to other kinds of categories whose colimits are well-behaved with respect to a type of limit, such as [[sifted colimit|sifted]] categories.

This can be rephrased in more elementary terms by saying that:

* There exists an object of $C$  (the case when $D=\emptyset$)
* For any two objects $c_1,c_2\in C$, there exists an object $c_3\in C$ and morphisms $c_1\to c_3$ and $c_2\to c_3$.
* For any two [[parallel morphisms]] $f,g:c_1\to c_2$ in $C$, there exists a morphism $h:c_2\to c_3$ such that $h f = h g$.

Just as all finite [[colimit|colimits]] can be constructed from initial objects, binary coproducts, and coequalizers, so a cocone on any finite diagram can be constructed from these three.

More generally, if $\kappa$ is a [[cardinal number]], then a **$\kappa$-filtered category** is one such that any diagram $D\to C$ has a cocone where $D$ has fewer than $\kappa$ arrows.  Note that a [[preorder]] is $\kappa$-filtered as a category just when it is $\kappa$-[[direction|directed]] as a preorder.


## Examples

* A filtered [[preorder]] is the same as a [[direction|directed]] one.

* Every category with a [[terminal object]] is filtered.

* Every category which has finite [[colimit]]s is filtered.

* A [[product]] of filtered categories is filtered.
