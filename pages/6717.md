There is, up to [[isomorphism]], a unique simple [[group]] of [[order]] 2:

it has two elements $(1,\sigma)$, where $\sigm \cdot \sigma = 1$.


This is usually denoted $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, becuase it is the [[quotient]] of the map

$$
  \cdot 2 : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

on the additive group of [[integer]]s.
