## Definition

There is, up to [[isomorphism]], a unique simple [[group]] of [[order of a group|order]] 2:

it has two elements $(1,\sigma)$, where $\sigma \cdot \sigma = 1$.


This is usually denoted $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, because it is the [[cokernel]] (the [[quotient]] by the [[image]] of) the  homomorphism

$$
  \cdot 2 : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

on the additive group of [[integers]]. As such $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the special case of a [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $p = 2$ and hence also often denoted $C_2$.
