Let $n\gt 2$. The Drinfel'd-Kohno Lie algebra is a $\mathbf{Z}$-algebra $L_n$ defined by generators $t_{ij} = t_{ji}$, $1\leq i\neq j\leq n$ subject to the relations 

$$
[t_{ij}, t_{kl}] = 0, \,\,\,[t_{ij}, t_{ik}+t_{jk}] = 0, \,\,\,\,\,1\leq i\neq j\neq k\neq l\leq n
$$

It is the [[holonomy Lie algebra]] of the [[configuration space]] $X_n$ of $n$ distincts points in the complex plane. Hence, it can be used to define a flat connection on $X_n$, which is universal among [[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation]]s. 

Therefore, it induces a monodromy representation of $\pi_1(X_n)$ which is isomorphic to the pure [[braid group]]:
$$
PB_n \longrightarrow \exp(L_n \otimes \mathbf{C})
$$

It was shown by Kohno that the extension of this map to the $\mathbf{C}$-pro-unipotent completion of $PB_n$ is an isomorphism. Drinfeld showed using [[Drinfeld associator|associators]] that the same holds true over $\mathbf{Q}$.

In particular, $U(L_n \otimes \mathbf{Q})$ is isomorphic to the [[associated graded]] of $\mathbf{Q}[PB_n]$ with respect to the filtration induced by powers of the augmentation ideal. Since it is known that this filtration coincides with the one induced by the [[Vassiliev skein relation]], $U(L_n \otimes \mathbf{Q})$ may be identified with the algebra of horizontal [[chord diagrams]].

The universal enveloping $U(L_n)\otimes \mathbf{Q}$ is a Koszul algebra.
