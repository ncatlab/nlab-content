## Idea

In [[type theory]] a _[[type formation rule]]_ is a [[natural deduction]] step roughly of the form

$$
  \frac{
    \vdash\; A \colon Type \;\;\; \vdash \;B \colon Type \;\;\; \cdots 
  }{
    \vdash \; F(A,B,\cdots) \colon Type
  }
$$

which says that given [[types]] $A, B, \cdots $, there is a new type $F(A,B, \cdots)$. 

For instance for [[product types]] it says that

$$
  \frac{\vdash \; A \colon Type \;\;\; \vdash \; B \colon Type}{\vdash \; A \times B \colon Type}
  \,.
$$

In [[natural deduction]] the type formation rule for a kind of type in the first in a quadruple of rules that come with every kind of type:

1. **type formation rule**

1. [[term introduction rule]]

1. [[term elimination rule]]

1. [[computation rule]]

## Properties

### Relation to category theory

Under the [[relation between type theory and category theory]], the [[categorical semantics]] of type formation essentially corresponds to certain [[universal constructions]] in [[category theory]].
