This entry is about [[Pierre Deligne]]'s article

* __Catégories Tannakiennes__, [[Grothendieck Festschrift]], vol. II,  Birkhäuser Progress in Math. 87 (1990) pp.111-195.

The main theorem is a [[Tannaka duality|Tannakian reconstruction theorem]], which repairs a problem in the book 

* N. Saavedra Rivano, _Catégories Tannakiennes_, Springer LNM 265, 1972 

which had a substantial gap in the proof of the main theorem.

At the end of the article there is an application to the [[differential Galois theory]] (which has been earlier much studied by A. R. Magid) which is the Galois theory for differential rather than algebraic equations. 

The article had a huge influence not only in Tannakian theory but also in creating more technical exchange between the modern [[algebraic geometry]] with [[category theory]] and [[bialgebra|bi(al)gebras]].
