This entry will be about Pierre Deligne's article

__Catégories Tannakiennes__, [[Grothendieck Festschrift]], vol. II,  Birkhäuser Progress in Math. 87 (1990) pp.111-195.

The main theorem is a Tannakian reconstruction theorem, which repairs a problem in the book

which had a substantial gap in the proof of the main theorem.

The article had a huge influence not only in Tannakian theory but also in creating more technical exchange between the modern algebraic geometry with category theory and bi(al)gebras.
