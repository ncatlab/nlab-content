## Definition

A [[morphism]] $f\colon A\to B$ in a [[2-category]] $K$ is said to be **(representably) pseudomonic** if for all objects $X$, the induced [[functor]]
$$K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$$
is [[pseudomonic functor|pseudomonic]].  In [[Cat]], this is equivalent to $f$ being pseudomonic in the usual sense.

## Remarks

* Pseudomonic morphisms may also be called **(2,1)-monic** and said to make their [[source]] into a **(2,1)-subobject** of their [[target]].  See [[subcategory]] for discussion.

* Of course, any [[fully faithful morphism]] is also pseudomonic, and in particular any [[inverter]] or [[equifier]] is pseudomonic.
