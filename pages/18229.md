The nLab recognizes two distinct usages of the term "projective set". 

* A [[projective object]] in a [[category of sets]]; see also [[choice object]]. 

* A set of real numbers definable by a [[formula]] of [[second-order arithmetic]] with real parameters (where "real numbers" has some latitude of meaning among [[descriptive set theory|descriptive set theorists]], referring to structures that are [[Borel set|Borel isomorphic]] to the standard [[real numbers]]). 

This article will touch upon the latter usage, as that is what is more commonly understood among mathematicians.
