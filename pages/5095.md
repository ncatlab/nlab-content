## Idea

Supercompact cardinals are among the [[large cardinal]]s.


## Definition

For $S$ a [[set]] and $\kappa$ a [[cardinal]], let $P_\kappa(S)$ be the set of [[subset]]s of $S$ of cardinality less than $\kappa$.

For $\lambda$ an [[ordinal]] a cardinal $\kappa$ is called **$\lambda$-supercompact** if $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ admits a [[normal measure]]. It is **supercompact** if it is $\lambda$-supercompact for every $\lambda$.

$\kappa$ being $\lambda$-supercompact is equivalent to there being an [[elementary embedding]]  $j : V \to M$ such that $j(\alpha) = \alpha$ for all $\alpha \lt \kappa$ and $j(\kappa) \gt \lambda$, where $M$ is an [[inner model]] such that $\{f | f : \lambda \to M\} \subset M$, i.e. every $\lambda$-sequence of elements of $M$ is an element of $M$.  


## Properties

By invoking [[Vopěnka's principle]] one can make strong statements about the existence of [[reflective subcategories]].  The assumption of supercompact cardinals is much weaker, and accordingly they similarly imply existence of reflective subcategories only under some more additional assumptions.  The following theorems are all from ([BCMR](#BagariaCasacubertaMathiasRosicky)).

###### Theorem
Suppose there are arbitrarily large supercompact cardinals.  Then if $L$ is a reflection on an accessible category $C$ and the class of $L$-equivalences is $\Sigma_2$-[[Levy hierarchy|definable]], then the $L$-local objects are a small-orthogonality class (so that $L$ is a localization with respect to some [[set]] of morphisms).

###### Theorem
Suppose there are arbitrarily large supercompact cardinals.  Then any full subcategory of a locally presentable category which is closed under limits and $\Sigma_2$-[[Levy hierarchy|definable]] is reflective.

There is also a generalization to $\Sigma_n$-definability involving [[C(n)-extendible cardinals]]; see [[Vopenka's principle]].
