Welcome on my personal webpage at the nlab.

# Position {#position}

I am currently maître de conférence (assistant professor) of
[University Paris 6](http://www.upmc.fr/) at
[Jussieu's mathematical institute](http://www.institut.math.jussieu.fr/)
in the
[Algebraic analysis group](http://www.institut.math.jussieu.fr/projets/aa/).


# Research {#myresearch}

I have two main domains of interest:

Mathematics of quantum field theory: i am presently writing a book whose aim is to give a coordinate free (i.e., categorical) presentation of many tools (and theories) used in the classical and quantum aspects of field theory:

* [Towards the mathematics of quantum field theory](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~fpaugam/documents/enseignement/master-mathematical-physics.pdf).

Arithmetic geometry: i did my Phd thesis on Abelian varieties, Galois representations and Shimura varieties. My recent interests are related to global analytic geometry, that is an approach alternative to scheme theory
in the geometric study of (analytic) number theory. You can find a presentation of this subject in my master course notes
(preliminary form):

* [Global analytic geometry and the functional equation](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~fpaugam/documents/enseignement/master-global-analytic-geometry.pdf).

# Webpage {#contact} 

You can find further informations on me (publications, preprints, etc...) on my
[academic webpage](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~fpaugam/parts-en/index.html).
