###### Definition
**(Quillen bifunctor)**

Let $C, D, E$ be [[model category|model categories]]. A
[[functor]] $F : C \times D \to E$ is a **Quillen bifunctor** 
if it satisfies the following two conditions:

1. for any cofibration $i : c \to c'$ in $C$ and cofibration 
   $j : d \to d'$ in $D$, the induced morphism 
   
   $$
     F(c', d) \coprod_{F(c,d)} F(c,d') \to F(c', d')
   $$

   is a cofibration in $E$, which is a weak equivalence if either $i$ or $j$ is 
   a weak equivalence

1. it preserves [[colimit]]s separately in each variable

#Remarks#

In full detail the [[pushout]] appearing in the first condition is 

$$
  \array{
    F(c,d) &\stackrel{F(Id,j)}{\to}& F(c,d')
    \\
    \;\;\downarrow^{F(i,Id)} && \downarrow
    \\
    F(c',d) &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    F(c', d) \coprod_{F(c,d)} F(c,d') 
  }
$$

So in particular, if $i = Id$ we have $F(i,Id) = Id$  and then the condition is simply that

* $F(c,j) :  F(c,d) \to F(c,d')$ is a (trivial) cofibration if $j$ is a (trivial) cofibration.

Similarly when $j = Id$.

# Applications #

* In a [[monoidal model category]] $C$ the [[tensor product]] $\otimes : C \times C \to C$
  is required to be a Quillen bifunctor.
  
* An [[enriched model category]] $D$ over the [[monoidal model category]] $C$
  is one that is [[power]]ed and [[copowered]] over $D$ such that the
  [[copower]] $\otimes : D \otimes C \to D$ is a Quillen bifunctor.

# Properties #

The following proposition asserts that under mild conditions
a Quillem bifunctor on $C \times D$ lifts to a Quillen bifunctor
on [[functor category|functor categories]] of functors to $C$ and $D$.

###### Proposition

Let $\otimes : C \times D \to E$ be a Quillen functor. Let 

* $S$ be a [[Reedy category]] 
  and take the [[functor category|functor categories]] 
  $[S,C]$ and $[S^{op},C]$ be equipped with the corresponding[[Reedy model structure]].
  
* _or_ assume that $C$ and $D$ are [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial model categories]]
  and let $[S,C]$ and $[S^{op},A]$ be equipped, respective with the projective and
  the injective globel [[model structure on functor categories]].
  
Then the [[coend]] [[functor]]

$$
  \int^{S} (- \otimes -) : [S,C]\times [S^{op},D] \to E
$$

is again a Â´Quillen bifunctor.
