## Idea

A model for [[dark matter]] made up of massive but extremely light [[particles]], whose [[de Broglie wavelength]] is at the scale of galaxies. 

The idea is that on scales above that of galaxies, the predictions of fuzzy dark matter agree with the standard cold dark matter models that work exceptionally well on [[cosmology|cosmological scales]], while on scales of the size of galaxies the [[quantum physics|quantum]] properties of these light particles become relevant and change their effect just so as to fix the problems (see also [[MOND]]) that standard cold dark matter models have on these scales.

A natural candidate for such ultra-light particles are [[axions]].

This kind of model was brought up independently by several groups of authors (see [Lee 17](#Lee17) for historical survey) with early precursors going back as far as ([Baldeschi-Gelmini-Ruffini 83](#BaldeschiGelminiRuffini83)), and accordingly goes by a number of different names, including the following:

* _[[Bose-Einstein condensate]] (BEC) dark matter_

* _[[superfluid]] dark matter_ ([Berezhiani-Khoury 15](#BerezhianiKhoury15), [Khoury 16](#Khoury16))

* _fuzzy dark matter_ ([Wu-Barkana-Gruzinov 00](#WuBarkanaGruzinov00))

* _ultra-light [[axion]]_

* _wave dark matter_

* _repulsive dark matter_


and more.
