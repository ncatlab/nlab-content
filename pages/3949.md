Interloper from the land of additive 1-categories which aren't Barr exact...

* [old website](http://server.math.umanitoba.ca/~choi/pubmath/math_index.html) which has some stuff
* [new website](http://math.usask.ca/~choi/) which will hopefully get fleshed out one day



Some things I am considering trying to write about, or contribute to. (This is mainly meant as a list to remind or nag me to write things down.)
* [projective, injective and flat Banach spaces][projective Banach space] (both in the metric and topological categories of [[Banach space]]s)
* RKHS
* the bidualization monad on Banach spaces
* Categori(c)al basics of operator spaces
* functorial aspects of the group von Neumann algebra construction
* cabbages
* kings
* whether pigs have wings
