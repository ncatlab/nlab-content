Interloper/dilettante. "Functional analyst", who sometimes wonders if the term meant something different in Britain that it does in North America. Keeps finding category-theoretic things all over the place in *old* analysis, never mind the brave new world of NCG, and is starting to feel that they should be collated somewhere.

### To do list ###
Some things I am considering trying to write about, or contribute to. (This is mainly meant as a list to remind or nag me to write things down.)
* [projective, injective and flat Banach spaces][projective Banach space] (both in the metric and topological categories of [[Banach space]]s)
* RKHS
* the bidualization monad on [[Banach space]]s
* Kaijser and Wick-Pelletier's work on interpolation
* Arens-Eells spaces, a.k.a. the adjunction between Banach spaces and metric spaces.
* Richard Arens's paper using "phyla", or: where Banach algebras and [[symmetric monoidal categories]] should have met
* Categori(c)al basics of operator spaces
* functorial aspects of the group von Neumann algebra construction
* cabbages
* kings
* whether pigs have wings
