* [projective, injective and flat Banach spaces][projective Banach space] (both in the metric and topological categories of [[Banach space]]s)
* RKHS
* the bidualization monad on Banach spaces
* Categori(c)al basics of operator spaces
* functorial aspects of the group von Neumann algebra construction
* cabbages
* kings
* whether pigs have wings
