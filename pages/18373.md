###### Definition

The **infinitesimally thickened Sierpinski topos** is the topos of presheaves on the ordinal category \mathbf{3}: $\{ 0 \to 1 \to 2 \}$. The name emphasizes the view of this topos as exhibiting [[differential cohesion]] over the cohesive [[Sierpinski topos]] using the coreflective embedding $i : \mathbf{2} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{3}$ sending $0$ to $0$ and $1$ to $2$.
