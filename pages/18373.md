###### Definition

The **infinitesimally thickened Sierpinski topos** is the topos of presheaves on the ordinal category $\mathbf{3}: \{ 0 \to 1 \to 2 \}$. The name emphasizes the view of this topos as exhibiting [[differential cohesion]] over the cohesive [[Sierpinski topos]] using the coreflective embedding $i : \mathbf{2} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{3}$ sending $0$ to $0$ and $1$ to $2$.

The objects of the category are diagrams $A_2 \to A_1 \to A_0$ in $Set$ o and arrows are commuting squares.

## Properties


### Differential cohesion
 {#DifferentialCohesion}

We can view objects of the topos as exhibiting a simple notion of differential cohesion: in $A_r \to A_{inf} \to A_p$ the $A_r$ are the "real" points, the $A_{inf}$ are the "infinitesimal" points and the $A_p$ are the "pieces", i.e., connected components.

The coreflective embedding above results in an adjoint quadruple

$$
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Sh(\mathbf{2})
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}

  Sh(\mathbf{3})
  \,.
$$

which are defined explicitly as follows:

$$ i_!(A_1 \to A_0) = A_1 \to A_1 \to A_0 $$
$$i^*(A_2 \to A_1 \to A_0) = A_2 \to A_0$$
$$i_*(A_1 \to A_0) =  A_1 \to A_0 \to A_0$$
$$ i^!(A_2 \to A_1 \to A_0) = A_2 \to A_1$$

This gives us elementary characterizations of the various subcategories of $Sh(\mathbf{3})$ involved in differential cohesion:
* The [[reduced objects|reduced object]] are the image of $i_!$: so they have the same real and infinitesimal points.
* The [[coreduced objects|coreduced object]] are the image of $i_*$: pieces all consist of exactly one infinitesimal point.

and the differential modalities are defined as:
$$ \Re(A_2 \to A_1 \to A_0) = A_2 \to A_2 \to A_0$$
$$ \Im(A_2 \to A_1 \to A_0) = A_2 \to A_0 \to A_0$$
$$ \&(A_2 \to A_1 \to A_0) = A_2 \to A_1 \to A_1$$
