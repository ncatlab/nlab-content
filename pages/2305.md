The **deRham complex** of a [[manifold]] is the [[cochain complex]] which in degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$ has the [[vector space]] $Omega^n(X)$ of degree $n$ [[differential form]]s on $X$. The coboundary map is the deRham _exterior derivative_.

Under the wedge product, the deRham complex becomes a [[differential graded algebra]]. This may be regarded as the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T X$ of $X$.
