For [[vectors]] in [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{p,1}$ (regarded as the [[inner product space]] $(\mathbb{R}^{p+1}, \eta)$ for $\eta$ the [[Minkowski metric]]) _rapidity_ is the analog in [[Lorentzian geometry]] of what in [[Euclidean geometry]] would be the _[[angle]]_ to the [[time]]-axis. If vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{p,1}$ are thought of as [[tangent vectors]] to [[trajectories]] in [[Minkowski spacetime]], their rapidity is a measure for the _[[velocity]]_ of the trajectory, which is well-adapted to [[Lorentz transformations]].
