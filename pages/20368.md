__WebAssembly__ (wasm) is a modern low level language (mimicking assembly code, but independent of a machine) intended for implementation via a [[virtual machine]]. 
It is optimized for small compiling time and near native execution time, at least when implemented on a virtual machine on one of major [computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) (like the x86 or ARM series). It is created as a new VM standard for web browsers, backed by major internet companies; it is also used or planned on a number of [[blockchain]] projects, most notably Parity [[zoranskoda:substrate|Substrate]]. On web browsers it is highly interoperable with JavaScript.

[[Rust]] language has small runtime, which is desirable in common applications of WebAssembly. Thus Rust commonly compiles either to native code or to wasm.

Ethereum flavoured version of wasm VM specification is at github/[ewasm](https://github.com/ewasm), see also github/[ewasm/design](https://github.com/ewasm/design). eWasm has a [testnet](http://ewasm.ethereum.org/explorer). According to article _[ewasm explained](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/ewasm)_, 

> The ewasm specification consists of a subset of WebAssembly components suitable for Ethereumâ€™s needs, namely determinism and relevant features. It also includes a number of system smart contracts that provide access to Ethereum platform features.

[[zoranskoda:EOS]] is a [[high performance DLs|high TPS]] blockchain using wasm VM.
