## Idea

The following idea or observation or sentiment has been expressed independently by many authors. We quote from [Szudzik 10, section 2](#Szudzik10):

> The central problem is that [[model (physics)|physical models]] use [[real numbers]] to represent the values of [[observable|observable quantities]], $[...]$ Careful consideration of this problem, however, reveals that the real numbers are not actually necessary in physical models. [[natural number|Non-negative integers]] suffice for the representation of observable quantities because numbers [[measurement|measured]] in laboratory [[experiments]] necessarily have only finitely many digits of precision.

Diverse conclusions have been drawn from this. One which seems useful and well-informed by the theory of [[computability]] in [[mathematics]] is the following (further quoting from [Szudzik 10, section 2](#Szudzik10))

> So, we suffer no loss of generality by restricting the values of all observable quantities to be expressed as [[natural numbers|non-negative integers]] — the restriction only forces us to make the methods of error analysis, which were tacitly assumed when dealing with real numbers, an explicit part of each model.

In type-I [[computability]] the [[computable functions]] are [[partial recursive functions]] and in view of this some authors conclude (and we still quote [Szudzik 10, section 2](#Szudzik10)) for this:

> To show that a [[model (physics)|model]] $[$ of physics $]$ is [[computable function|computable]], the model must somehow be expressed using [[partial recursive function|recursive functions]].

However, in [[computability theory]] there is also the concept of _[[computable function (analysis)|type-II computable functions]]_ used in the field of "[[constructive analysis]]", "[[computable analysis]]". This is based on the idea that for instance for specifying [[computable real numbers]] as used in [[physics]], an [[algorithm]] may work not just on single [[natural numbers]], but indefinitely on sequences of them, producing output that is in each step a finite, but in each next step a more accurate approximation. 

[[!include computable mathematics -- table]]

This concept of [[computable analysis|type-II computability]] is arguably closer to actual practice in [[physics]].

Of course there is a wide-spread (but of course controversial) vague speculation (often justified by alluding to expected implications of [[quantum gravity]] on the true microscopic nature of [[spacetime]] and sometimes formalized in terms of cellular automata, e.g. [Zuse 67](#Zuse67)) that in some sense the [[observable universe]] is fundamentally "[[finite object|finite]]", so that in the end [[computability]] is a non-issue in [[physics]] as one is really operating on a large but [[finite set]] of states.

However, since fundamental physics is [[quantum physics]] and since [[quantum mechanics]] with its [[wave functions]], [[Hilbert spaces]] and [[probability amplitudes]] invokes ([[functional analysis|functional]]) [[analysis]] and hence "non-finite mathematics" even when describing the minimum of a [[physical system]] with only two possible configurations (a "[[qbit]]") a strict [[finitism]] perspective on fundamental [[physics]] runs into problems (highlighted for instance in ([Feynman 81, slide 15](#Feynman81))). Precisely this kind of issue is the topic of _[[computable analysis]]_ ("[[constructive analysis]]", "[[exact analysis]]") with its type-II notion of [[computable functions]], which would therefore seem to be the right mathematical context discussing [[computability]] in fundamental (namely quantum) [[physics]]. 

This issue of computable _quantum_ physics has only more recently been considered, in ([Streicher 12](#Streicher12)), where it is shown that at least a fair bit of the [[Hilbert space]] technology of [[quantum mechanics]]/[[quantum logic]] sits inside the [[function realizability topos]] $RT(\mathcal{K}_2)$.
