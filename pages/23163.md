## Definition

An __entire functional calculus algebra__ is a [[product]]-[[preserved limit|preserving]] [[functor]]
$$CartHolo \to Set,$$
where $CartHolo$ is the [[category]] of [[finite dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[complex vector spaces]]
and [[holomorphic maps]].

This is in complete analogy to [[C^∞-rings]],
and EFC-algebras are applicable in similar contexts.

## Properties

The category of globally [[finitely presented object|finitely presented]] [[Stein spaces]]
is [[contravariant functor|contravariantly]] [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[finitely presented object|finitely presented]]
EFC-algebras.
The equivalence functor sends a [[Stein space]] to its EFC-algebra of [[global sections]].

The category of [[Stein spaces]] of finite embedding dimension
is contravariantly equivalent to the category of finitely generated EFC-algebras.
The equivalence functor sends a [[Stein space]] to its EFC-algebra of global sections.


These statements can thus be rightfully known as [[Stein duality]].
