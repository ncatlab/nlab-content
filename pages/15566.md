## Idea

The [[spectrum of a commutative ring|spectrum]] of the [[commutative ring]] $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]].

The [[gros topos|gros]] [[etale topos]] over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ is the context for [[arithmetic geometry]]. By the discussion at _[[Borger's absolute geometry]]_ it sits via an [[essential geometric morphism]] over the [[F1]]-[[topos]]:

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))\longrightarrow Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))
$$

## Properties

### As a 3-dimensional space 
 {#As3dSpaceContainingKnots}

#### As a 3-sphere containing knots

Several properties of $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ make it behave as if of [[dimension]] 3. For instance $Spec(\mathbb{Z}) \cup \{\infty\}$ has [[étale cohomology|étale]] [[cohomological dimension]] equal to 3, up to 2-torsion ([Mazur 73](#Mazur73)). Moreover the [[étale fundamental group]] $\hat \pi_1(Spec(\mathbb{Z}) \cup \{\infty\})$ is trivial, and hence Mazur suggested that $Spec(\mathbb{Z}) \cup \{\infty\}$ is in fact analogous to the [[3-sphere]].

Similarly, the spectra $Spec(\mathbb{F}_q)$ of [[finite fields]]  look like compact 1-dimensional spaces -- [[circles]] -- in that their [[étale cohomology]] with $\mathbb{Z}_l$-[[coefficients]] for $l$ coprime to $q$ is $\mathbb{Z}_l$ in degrees 0 and 1 and vanishes in all higher degrees.

From this it is [[folklore]] (going back to [Mazur](#Mazur) and Manin, review includes [Deninger 05, section 8](#Deninger05), [Kohno-Morishita 06](#KohnoMorishita06)) that the spectra of [[prime fields]] with their canonical embedding into $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$

$$
  Spec(\mathbb{F}_p) \hookrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{Z})
$$

(formally dual to the canonical mod-$p$ [[projection]] $\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{F}_p$) are analogous to [[knots]] inside this 3-dimensional space (a good exposition is in [LeBruyn](#LeBruyn10)). 

Observations like this give rise to the field of [[arithmetic topology]].

### As a hyperbolic 3-manifold containing prime geodesics

However, in view of the [analogy between the Selberg zeta function and the Artin L-function](Selberg%20zeta%20function#AnalogyWithArtinLFunction) it might be more appropriate to think of $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ as analogous to a  [[hyperbolic manifold]] of dimension 3 (see also [Fujiwara 07, slide 7](#Fujiwara07)) and of these fine field spectra as analogous to the [[prime geodesics]] in there. This does not change the fact that every single $Spec(\mathbb{F}_p) \hookrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ is like an embedded circle, hence like a knot, but it affects the perspective on which role these play. For instance there does not seem to be a differential geometric analog situation where one considers [[infinite products]] over all knots in a 3-space, but there are such situations where one considers infinite products over all [[prime geodesics]] in a space, namely the [[Selberg zeta function]] analogous to the [[Artin L-function]] with its product over [[prime ideals]].
