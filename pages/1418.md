An object $X$ of a category $C$ is said to be finitely presentable (or finitary) if the representable
functor $C(X, )$ preserves filtered colimits. Write $C_{fp}$ for the full subcategory of $C$ on the
finitely presentable objects.

A category $C$ satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions is said to be _locally finitely presentable_:

1. $C$ has all small limits and colimits, the category $C_{fp}$ is essentially small, and any object in $C$
is a filtered colimit of the finitely presentable objects which map into it.
1. $C$ is the category of models for an essentially algebraic theory.
1. $C$ is equivalent to the category of finite-limit-preserving functors $D \to Set$ for some small
category $D$ with finite limits.
1. $C$ is equivalent to the category of finite-limit-preserving functors $C_{fp} \to Set$.
1. $C$ is the category of models for a finite limit sketch.

###Examples###

Set, Graph, Poset, Cat, Ab are all lfp.

Top, FinSet are not lfp.
