# The Anonymous Coward
* table of contents
{: toc}

The **Anonymous Coward** is the original default username for editing [[nLab:HomePage|this wiki]], assigned by the software.  So if somebody edited the wiki without signing in, then their edits would be attributed to the _Anonymous Coward_.  We now write simply _Anonymous_.  A few jokers have changed 'AnonymousCoward' to something different but equally anonymous ... which is OK too.

However, people who *really* want to be anonymous should know that every editor\'s IP address is (usually) listed in the entry's history (found by clicking _history_ at the bottom of any page).
