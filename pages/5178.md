## Idea

When doing [[category theory]] relative to a  [[base topos]] $S$ (or other more general sort of [[category]]), the objects of $S$ are thought of as replacements for [[sets]].  Since often in category theory we need to speak of "a set-indexed family of objects" of some category, we need a corresponding notion in "category theory over $S$."  An **$S$-indexed category** is a [[category]] $\mathbb{C}$ together with, for every [[object]] $X\in S$, a notion of "$X$-indexed family of objects of $\mathbb{C}$."

## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[category]].

###### Definition

An **$S$-indexed category** $C$ is a [[pseudofunctor]] 

$$
  \mathbb{C} : S^{op}\to Cat
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of $S$ to the [[2-category]] [[Cat]] of categories.

Under the [[Grothendieck construction]] [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] this is equivalently a [[fibered category]] 

$$
  \array{
    \tilde \mathbb{C} \\ \downarrow \\ S
  }
$$

over $S$.

Similarly, an $S$-[[indexed functor]] $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{D}$ is a [[pseudonatural transformation]] of pseudofunctors, and an indexed natural transformation is a [[modification]].  

This defines the [[2-category]] $S IndCat := [S^{op}, Cat]$ of $S$-indexed categories.

This appears for instance as ([Johnstone, def. B1.2.1](#Johnstone)).

One may also call $\mathbb{C}$ a [[prestack]] in categories over $S$.

Traditionally one writes the image of $X\in an object S$ under $\mathbb{C}$ as $\mathbb{C}^X$ and calls it _the category of $X$-indexed families of objects of $\mathbb{C}$_ .  Similarly, one write thes image of a [[morphism]] $u\colon X\to Y$ as $u^*\colon \mathbb{C}^Y\to \mathbb{C}^X$.


## Examples

* If $S$ has [[pullbacks]], then its [[codomain fibration]] is an $S$-indexed category denoted $\mathbb{S}$, with $\mathbb{S}^X = S/X$.  This indexed category represents $S$ itself in the world of $S$-indexed categories.

* If $F\colon S\to T$ is a [[functor]] and $\mathbb{C}$ is a $T$-indexed category, then we have an $S$-indexed category $F^*\mathbb{C}$ defined by $(F^*\mathbb{C})^X = \mathbb{C}^{F(X)}$.

* In particular, if $S$ and $T$ are [[finitely complete categories]] and $F\colon S\to T$ is a [[left exact functor]], then $F^*\mathbb{T}$ is an $S$-indexed category that represents $T$.  This situation frequently arises when $S$ and $T$ are [[toposes]] and $F$ is the [[inverse image]] part of a [[geometric morphism]].  In this way, if $S$ is a topos, then any topos *over* $S$ (i.e. an object of the [[slice 2-category]] $Topos/S$) gives rise to a topos *relative to* $S$, i.e. a "topos object" in the 2-category of $S$-indexed categories, and this operation can be shown to be fully faithful.
