## Idea

Diagram chasing is a common technique in [[homological algebra]] for proving properties of and constructing morphisms in [[abelian category|abelian categories]], where one traces elements in various ways around [[commutative diagram|commutative diagrams]].

## Examples

Many basic lemmas in homological algebra, such as the [[five lemma]], the [[3x3 lemma]] and the [[snake lemma]], are typically proven by diagram chases. See for instance the proof at _[[five lemma]]_ or any book on homological algebra.

The [[salamander lemma]] can sometimes be used to give more conceptual proofs.

## Diagram chases in general abelian categories

There are at least five approaches to performing diagram chases in general abelian categories (not assumed to be [[concrete category|concrete]] like [[Ab]] or $R$[[Mod]]), roughly listed in increasing order of sophistication:

1. Directly use the universal properties of the objects involved ([[kernel|kernels]], [[cokernel|cokernels]] etc.).
1. Use equivalence classes of [[generalized element|generalized elements]] to mimic naive (element-based) proofs, as detailed at _[[element in an abelian category]]_. These can only be used to show properties of already-given morphisms and not to construct morphisms (for example the [[connecting homomorphism]] of a short exact sequence) by giving their action on elements.
1. Use genuine generalized elements, see _[[element in an abelian category]]_. With these, the naive way of constructing morphisms $A \to B$ (first showing that for every $a \in A$ there exists a certain $b \in B$, then showing that this is independent of any choices made) carries over to the general setting.
1. Interpret constructive element-based proofs written in the fragment of [[regular logic]] using categorical semantics, see _[[internal logic]]_. The naive way of constructing morphisms works because the "axiom of unique choice" is valid in abelian categories (see [Johnstone, Prop. D1.3.12](#Johnstone)).
1. Use the [[Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem]].
