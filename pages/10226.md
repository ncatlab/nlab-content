## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] and in the [[Schrödinger picture]], the term _propagator_ refers to the [[linear map]] between [[spaces of quantum states]] ([[wave functions]]) which describes how these [[states]] change in [[time]] ([[spacetime]]), hence how the corresponding [[quantum system]] _propagates_.

In [[quantum mechanics]] the time [[propagator]] is given by the [[parallel transport]] along the [[worldline]] given by the [[Hamiltonian]] (energy) [[quantum operator]].

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] of [[free fields]] propagation is typically encoded in the [[Green functions]] of the [[wave equation]]/[[Klein-Gordon operator]] and here it is these Green functions that are referred to as _propagators_.
