## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] and in the [[Schr√∂dinger picture]], the term _propagator_ refers to the [[linear map]] between [[spaces of quantum states]] ([[wave functions]]) which describes how these [[states]] change in [[time]] ([[spacetime]]), hence how the corresponding [[quantum system]] _propagates_.

In [[quantum mechanics]] the time [[propagator]] is give by the [[parallel transport]] along the [[worldline]] given by the [[Hamiltonian]] (energy) [[quantum operator]].

Similarly, in [[perturbation theory]] the term _propagator_ usually refers to the [[kinetic action|kinetic]] [[action functional]]/[[Lagrangian]].
