## Idea

The _axion_ is hypothetical type of [[field (physics)|field]]/[[fundamental particle]] related to the [[strong CP problem]].

## In string theory

In [[string theory]] axion fields naturally arise in various ways [Svrcek-Witten 06](#SvrcekWitten06):

> An obvious question about the axion hypothesis is how natural it really is. Why
introduce a global PQ “symmetry” if it is not actually a symmetry? What is the sense in constraining a theory so that the classical Lagrangian possesses a certain symmetry if the symmetry is actually anomalous? It could be argued that the best evidence that PQ “symmetries” are natural comes from string theory, which produces them without any contrivance. ... the string compactifications always generate PQ symmetries, often spontaneously broken at the string scale and producing axions, but sometimes unbroken.([Svrcek-Witten 06, pages 3-4](#SvrcekWitten06))


In [[heterotic string theory]] [[KK-compactification|KK-compactified]] to 4d, the 4d [[B-field]], dualizes, serves as the axion field, called the "model independent axion" ([Svrcek-Witten 06, starting p. 15](#SvrcekWitten06)),

  > Primordial decays of [[string theory]] [[moduli stabilization|moduli]] at $z \sim 10^{12}$ naturally generate a [[dark radiation]] Cosmic Axion Background (CAB) with $0.1 - 1 keV$ energies. This CAB can be detected through axion-[[photon]] conversion in astrophysical [[magnetic fields]] to give quasi-thermal excesses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray bands. Substantial and observable luminosities may be generated even for axion-photon couplings $\ll 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$. We propose that axion-photon conversion may explain the observed excess emission of soft X-rays from galaxy clusters, and may also contribute to the diffuse unresolved cosmic X-ray background. We list a number of correlated predictions of the scenario.
