## Idea

Motivated by the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]], the _suspension category_ of ([Spanier-Whitehead 53](#SpanierWhitehead53)) has as [[objects]] [[pointed topological space|pointed]]  [[CW-complexes]], and as [[hom-sets]] it has [[colimits]] $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_q [\Sigma^q X , \Sigma^q Y]$ over [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]] between their arbitrary high [[suspensions]].

Later it was realized (see e.g. [Whitehead 62](#Whitehead62)) that this is usefully thought as just the [[full subcategory]] on the [[suspension spectra]] inside the larger category of [[spectra]]: the [[stable homotopy category]].
