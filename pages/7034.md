## Idea

In [[type theory]]/[[categorical semantics]] some logical operations on [[propositions]]/[[h-level 1]] a priori lead out of the class of propositions into [[h-level 2]], namely forming [[or]]/[[sum type]] and [[existential quantification]]/[[dependent sum type]].

The _bracket type_ of a given type is the _underlying proposition_ in the sense of [[propositions as types]], namely the [[truncated|(-1)-truncation]]/[[h-level 1|h-level 1-projection]].


## Properties

[[dependent type theory]] with the [[unit type]], 
[[strong extensional equality types]],
strong [[dependent sums]], and bracket types is the 
[[internal logic|internal]] [[type theory]] of 
[[regular categories]].

## Semantics

The [[semantics]] of bracket types in a [[regular category]] $C$ is as follows.

For 

    A ( x : X) : Type

a [[dependent type]] (type in [[context]] $X$) it is interpreted in $C$ as a [[morphism]]

$$
  \array{
    A
    \\  
    \downarrow
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding bracket type

    [A] (x : X) : Type

is interpreted then as the [[image]]-[[(epi, mono) factorization system|factorization]] 

$$
  \array{
     A &&\to&& [A] & := im(A \to X)
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
    \,.
  }
$$

Therefore $[A] \to X$ is a [[monomorphism]] and hence the interpretation of a [[proposition]] about the elements of $X$.
