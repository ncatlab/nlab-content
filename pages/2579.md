## Definition

A __group scheme__ is a [[group object]] in the category of [[schemes]]. 


In the [[functor of points]] formalism, a group scheme over a scheme $X$ is a functor
$$
G: (Sch /X)^{op} \to Grp
$$
(where [[Grp]] is the category of discrete [[groups]]) such that the composition with the forgetful functor $F: Grp \to Set$ is [[representable functor|representable]]. 

See also [[formal group]].

## Examples

* Given any group $G$, one can form the constant group scheme $G_X$ over $X$. 

* Every [[algebraic group]] is in particular a group scheme.

* The functor $\mathbb{G}_m$ is a group scheme given by $\mathbb{G}_m(S)=\Gamma(S, \mathcal{O}_S)^\times$. A scheme is sent to the invertible elements of its global functions.

* The functor $\mathbb{G}_a$ is a group scheme given by $\mathbb{G}_a(S)=\Gamma(S, \mathcal{O}_S)$ the additive group of the ring of global functions.

* $\alpha_p$ is the subgroup scheme of $\mathbb{G}_a$ of $p$-nilpotent elements.

* $\mu_p$ is the subgroup scheme of $\mathbb{G}_m$ of $p$-th roots of unity.

## Morphisms

A morphism of group schemes $G\to H$ is a morphism of schemes that is a group homomorphism on any choice of values of points. This is more easily stated by saying that a morphism of group schemes must be a [[natural transformation]] between the functor of points.

## Cartier Dual

Suppose now that $G$ is a finite flat commutative group scheme (over $X$). The Cartier dual of $G$ is given by the functor $G^D(S)=Hom (G\otimes S, \mathbb{G}_m \otimes S)$. The Hom is taken in the category of group schemes over $S$.

For example, $\alpha_p^D\simeq \alpha_p$.
