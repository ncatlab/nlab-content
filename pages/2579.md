## Definition

A __group scheme__ is a [[group object]] in the category of [[schemes]]; in particular a group scheme is a [[group functor]]. As explained at [[group object]] there are two equivalent ways of realizing this.

One way is to define it as a functor $G:C Ring\to Set$ equipped with a transformation $m:G\times G\to G$ satisfying the properties spelled out at [[group object]].

The other way is to define it as a functor $Sch\to Grp$ from the category of schemes to that of (discrete) groups whose composition with the forgetful functor $Grp\to Set$ is representable.


Grothendieck emphasized the study of schemes over a fixed base scheme. Following this idea in the [[functor of points]] formalism, a group scheme over a scheme $X$ is a functor

$$
G: (Sch /X)^{op} \to Grp
$$
## Generalizations

This construction generalizes to [[ind-object|ind-schemes]] as for example [[formal scheme|formal schemes]] to that of a [[formal group scheme]].

## Examples

* For a field $k$ the terminal $k$-scheme $Sp_k k$ is a group scheme in a unique way.

* Given any group $G$, one can form the constant group scheme $G_X$ over $X$. 

* Every [[algebraic group]] is in particular a group scheme.

* The functor $\mu:=\mathbb{G}_m$ is a group scheme given by $\mathbb{G}_m(S)=\Gamma(S, \mathcal{O}_S)^\times$. A scheme is sent to the invertible elements of its global functions.

* The functor $\alpha:=\mathbb{G}_a$ is a group scheme given by $\mathbb{G}_a(S)=\Gamma(S, \mathcal{O}_S)$ the additive group of the ring of global functions.

* the kernel of any group scheme morphism is a group scheme.

In context of [[p-divisible group|p-divisible groups]] the kernels of the $k$-group scheme morphisms

$$(-)^n:\begin{cases}
\mu_k&\to& \mu_k
\\
x&\to &x^n
\end{cases}$$

and for $k$ a field with characteristic $p$

$$(-)^{p^r}:\begin{cases}
\alpha_k&\to& \alpha_k
\\
x&\to &x^{p^r}
\end{cases}$$

denoted by $\mu_n$ giving the group scheme of $n$-th root of unity  and $\alpha_p$ giving the group scheme of $p^n$-nilpotent elements are of particular interest.

## Morphisms

A morphism of group schemes $G\to H$ is a morphism of schemes that is a group homomorphism on any choice of values of points. This is more easily stated by saying that a morphism of group schemes must be a [[natural transformation]] between the functor of points.


## Cartier dual

Suppose now that $G$ is a finite flat commutative group scheme (over $X$). The __Cartier dual__ of $G$ is given by the functor $G^D(S)=Hom (G\otimes S, \mathbb{G}_m \otimes S)$. The Hom is taken in the category of group schemes over $S$.

For example, $\alpha_p^D\simeq \alpha_p$.
