A __group scheme__ is a [[group object]] in the category of [[schemes]]. In the [[functor of points]] formalism, a commutative group scheme over a scheme $X$ is a functor
$$
G: \mathrm{Sch} /X^{op} \to \mathrm{Ab}
$$
(where [[Ab]] is the category of [[abelian groups]]) such that composition with the forgetful functor $F: \mathrm{Ab} \to \mathrm{Set}$ is [[representable functor|representable]].
