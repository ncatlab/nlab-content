##Idea 

Methods from abstract [[homotopy theory]] can be used to define a suitable notion of [[homotopy equivalence]] for [[inverse semigroups]].
As an application of this theory, one can prove a theorem for inverse semigroup [[homomorphisms]] which is the exact counterpart of the well-known result in [[topology]] which states that every [[continuous function]] can be factorised into a homotopy equivalence followed by a [[fibration]].

In the paper [LMP](#LMP) it is shown that this factorisation is isomorphic to the one constructed by [[Ben Steinberg|Steinberg]] in his Fibration Theorem, originally proved using a generalisation of Tilson's derived category.
