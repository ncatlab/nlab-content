###### Definition
A **G-delta**, $G_\delta$, subset of a [[topological space]] is a set that can be written as the intersection of a [[countable]] family of open sets.

### Results

One place where $G_\delta$-subsets occur is when looking at [[continuous]] maps from an arbitrary [[topological space]] to a [[metric space]] (or, more generally, a [[first countable]] space).  In particular, when considering continuous real-valued functions.  Thus we have the following connections to the [[separation axioms]].

###### Proof
One direction is obvious.  For the other, let $v$ be a point in a completely regular space $X$ such that $\{v\}$ is a $G_\delta$-set.  Let $\{V_n\}$ be a sequence of open sets such that $\bigcap V_n = \{v\}$.  We now define a sequence of functions $(f_n)$ recursively with the properties:

1. $f_n \colon X \to [0,1]$ is a continuous function,
1. $f_n(v) = 1$,
1. $f_n^{-1}(1)$ is a neighbourhood of $v$,
1. for $n \gt 1$, $f_n$ has support in $V_n \cap f_{n-1}^{-1}(1)$ whilst $f_1$ has support in $V_1$,

Having defined $f_1, \dots, f_{n-1}$, we define $f_n$ as follows.  Since $V_n \cap f_{n-1}^{-1}(1)$ is a neighbourhood of $v$ and $X$ is completely regular, there is a continuous function $\tilde{f}_n \colon X \to [0,1]$ with support in this neighbourhood and such that $\tilde{f}_n(v) = 1$.  We then compose with a continuous, increasing surjection $[0,1] \to [0,1]$ which maps $[\frac12,1]$ to $1$.  The resulting function is the required $f_n$.

We then define a function $f \colon X \to [0,1]$ by

$$
f(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{2^n} f_n(x).
$$

By construction, $f^{-1}(1) = \{v\}$.

We need to prove that this is continuous.  First, note that if $f_n(x) \ne 0$ then $f_k(x) = 1$ for $k \lt n$ and if $f_n(x) \ne 1$ then $f_k(x) = 0$ for $k \gt n$.  Hence the preimage under $f$ of $(\frac{2^k-1}{2^k}, \frac{2^{k+1}-1}{2^{k+1})$ is $f_n^{-1}(0,1)$ and $f$ restricted to this preimage is a scaled translate of $f_n$.
From this, we deduce that the preimage of any open set not containing $1$ is open.  Thus $f$ is continuous everywhere except possibly at $v$.  Continuity at $v$ is similarly simple: given a set of the form $(1 -\epsilon,1]$ then there is some $n$ such that $2^{-n} \lt \epsilon$, whence $f^{-1}(1-\epsilon,1]$ contains all points such that $f_k(x) = 1$ for $k \le n$, which by construction is a neighbourhood of $v$.  Hence $f$ is continuous and has a single global maximum at $v$.
