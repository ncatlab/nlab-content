* [[Sergei Gukov]], [[Anton Kapustin]], 

  _Topological Quantum Field Theory, Nonlocal Operators, and Gapped Phases of Gauge Theories_ 

  ([arXiv:1307.4793](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4793))

The article considers the generalization of a phenomenon in [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in abelian ([[higher gauge theory|higher]]) [[gauge theory]], that was considered earlier in ([Banks-Seiberg 08](#BanksSeiberg08)), to _[[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]]_ [[higher gauge theory]], hence involving not just [[differential 1-form]] [[gauge potentials]] but 2-form gauge potentials ("nonabelian [[B-fields]]").

Specifically, in ([Banks-Seiberg 08, (2.4)-(2.9)](#BanksSeiberg08)) is an argument saying that some properties of the low energy limit of abelian [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills like]] [[gauge theories]] in four dimensions with ([[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like]]) [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] to a discrete gauge [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are described by a dual [[BF-theory]], hence a [[higher gauge theory]] represented by a [[principal 2-connection|2-connection]] instead of an ordinary [[connection on a bundle|connection]]. Here the duality is [[electric-magnetic duality]], but applied not to the 1-form [[gauge field]] but to the [[Higgs boson]]-like [[scalar field]], whose magentic dual in 4d is indeed a $(4 - (0+1) - 1 = 2)$-form  [[higher gauge field]]. See at _[[connection on a 2-bundle]]_ for more on this.

In the nonabelian case the proposed mechanism is no longer [[electric-magnetic duality]] of a [[Higgs boson]]-like [[field (physics)|field]], but instead to condensation of [[monopoles]].

The abelian phenomenon is reviewed and expanded on in its relation to higher dimensional [[QFT with defects|defect]] [[quantum operators]] in section III. Generalization to the nonabelian case is then in section IV. An outlook on the relation to structures such as in [[geometric Langlands duality]] is in section V.

> Here is an observation about how the idea in that section might be formalized. (Due to discussion among Domenico Fiorenza, Hisham Sati, and Urs Schreiber). 

The [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_n$ of "discrete [[gauge fields]]" for [[gauge group]] $\mathbb{Z}_n := \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N} $ may be realized as the following [[homotopy fiber]] of smooth moduli stacks of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle connections]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_n &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(-)^n}}
    \\
    \ast &\stackrel{0}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
  }
$$

(in [[Smooth∞Grpd]]). By construction, an element $X \to \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_n$ of this [[homotopy fiber]]  is equivalently

* a 1-form gauge field $\tilde F_A \colon X \to \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}$ with local connection 1-form $A$;

* a 0-form gauge field $\phi \colon \tilde F_A \to 0$ trivializing $\tilde F_A$, with local component $\phi$ locally satisfying $d \phi = n A$. 

This data is what motivates the discussion in the article. 

The [[electric-magnetic duality]] may be formulate as a "differential higher [[Pontryagin duality]]"

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 \hat \mathbb{Z}_n \simeq [\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_n, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}]
  \,,
$$

where $\hat \mathbb{Z}_n \coloneqq [\mathbb{Z}_n, U(1)] \simeq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is the [[Pontryagin dual]] group. 

For this [[moduli infinity-stack|higher moduli stack]] of discrete [[higher gauge theory|higher gauge fields]] we have a local description by smooth data as before: it fits into the [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}^2\mathbb{Z}_n &\to& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(-)^n}}
    \\
    \ast &\stackrel{0}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
  }
  \,.
$$

In analogy to the above, this now describes the space of field configurations consisting of a [[circle 2-group]]-[[connection on a 2-bundle|principal 2-connection]] $B$ and a trivialization of its $n$th power by a 1-form connection $A$, i.e. $d A - n B = 0$. 

This one may also understand as the vanishing condition on the 2-form curvature of a [[connection on a 2-bundle|2-connection]]. This is the observation that drives the second part of the article.

#### 1. Monopole condensation 

A notce concerning the discussion of [[monopoles]] on the bottom right of p. 5.

Let $G$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[Lie group]]. A [[subgroup]] 

$$
  \Gamma_0 \hookrightarrow \pi_1(G)
$$

of its [[fundamental group]] defines a [[covering]] $t \colon H \to G$, exhibited by the following [[pasting diagram]] of [[homotopy pullbacks]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]:

$$
  \array{
    \pi_1(G)/\Gamma_0 &\to& H &\to& \Pi(H) &\to& \mathbf{B}\pi_1(H) \simeq \mathbf{B}\Gamma_0 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{t}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Pi(t)}} && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\stackrel{e}{\to}& G &\stackrel{}{\to}& \Pi(G) &\stackrel{\tau_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B} \pi_1(G)
  }
$$

Here $(-) \to \Pi(-)$ is the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] of the [[shape modality]]. In the given low degree case the above diagram can be checked explicitly by standard means, but it may be worthwhile to note that the whole situation follows fully generally as by the [Galois theory in cohesive ](cohesive+%28infinity,1%29-topos+--+structures#GaloisTheory) ([Schreiber, section 3.8.6](#SchreiberCohesive)).
