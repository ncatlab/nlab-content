## Idea

While in the [[standard model of particle physics]] all [[hadrons]] and [[mesons]] are [[bound states]] of [[quarks]], the [[quarks]] themselves, together with the [[leptons]], are assumed to be "elementary" [[particles]], hence not themselves [[bound states]] of other particles.

While this does fit very well with current [[experimental observation]], one may speculate if at a higher energy scale [[quarks]] and/or [[leptons]] are themselves bound states of more fundamental particles. These hypothetical more fundamental particles are then generically called _preons_.
