###### Definition

The **relative dimension** at a point $x$ of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ of [[scheme]]s which is locally of finite type is the [[dimension]] of the [[topological space]] underlying the [[fiber]] $X_f$ at the point $x$.

I don't see this definition in (EGA, IV, 5.1.2), in fact I don't think it appears in EGA at all.  -- [[Adeel Ahmad Khan]]
