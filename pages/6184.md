## Idea

Generally, a _Verlinde formula_ gives the [[dimension]] of a [[space of states]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] for a given [[gauge group]] $G$. Depending on which one of various different algebraic means to expresses these spaces is used, the Verlinde formula equivalently computes the dimension of spaces of non-abelian [[theta functions]], the dimension of objects in a [[modular tensor category]] and so forth.


There are also Verlinde formulas in algebraic geometry (proved by Faltings) and a related one in the theory of [[vertex operator algebra]]s (proved only in very special cases).
