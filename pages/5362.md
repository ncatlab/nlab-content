Suppose $A$ is a small category, and let $Psh(A)=Set^{A^{op}}$ be the category of [[presheaves|presheaf]] on $A$. Since $Psh(A)$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], it has a unique [[subobject classifier]], $L$.  

Let $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ denote the initial object and terminal object respectively of $Psh(A)$.  The presheaf $1$ has exactly two subobjects $\mathbf{0}\hookrightarrow \mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{1}\hookrightarrow \mathbf{1}$.  These determine the unique two elements $\lambda^0,\lambda^1\in L(\mathbf{1})=Hom(\mathbf{1},L)$.      

We call the triple $\mathfrak{L}=(L,\lambda^0,\lambda^1)$ the Lawvere interval for the topos $Psh(A)$.  This object determines a unique cylinder functor given by taking the cartesian product with an object.  We will call this endofunctor the _Lawvere cylinder_.

Given any [[Cisinski model structure]] on $Psh(A)$, the object $L$ is trivially fibrant, since given any monomorphism $A\to B$ and any morphism $A\to L$, there exists a lifting $B\to L$.  To see this, notice that the morphism $A\to L$ classifies a subobject $C\hookrightarrow A$.  However, composing this with the monomorphism $A\hookrightarrow B$, this monomorphism is classified by a morphism $B\to L$ making the diagram commute.  For this reason, $\mathfrak{L}$ can be considered the universal cylinder object for Cisinski model structures on a presheaf topos.  

Indeed, given any small set of monomorphisms in $Psh(A)$, by applying a theorem of Cisinski, we can find the smallest Cisinski model structure for which those monomorphisms are trivial cofibrations. 

Example:

Suppose $A=\Delta$ is the [[simplex category]], and  let $S$ consist only of the inclusion $\{1\}:\Delta^0\to\Delta^1$. Applying Cisinski's anodyne completion of $S$ by Lawvere's cylinder $\mathbf{\Lambda}_\mathfrak{L}(S,M)$, we get exactly the [[contravariant model structure]] on the category of simplicial sets.
