## Idea

A _state_ is a configuration of a system in [[physics]].


## Definition

The precise mathematical notion of _state_ depends on what formalization is used to formalize this statement. 

### In classical mechanics

In simple situations of [[classical mechanics]] a state is a point in [[phase space]] -- some [[symplectic manifold]].

### In quantum mechanics

In simple situations in [[quantum mechanics]] as state is a ray in a [[Hilbert space]] --  the Hilbert space of states.

### In FQFT

In the [[FQFT]] formulation of [[quantum field theory]], a physical system is given by a [[cobordism]] [[representation]]

$$
  Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

In this formulation the [[k-morphism|(n-1)-morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ assigned to an $(n-1)$-dimensional [[manifold]] $\Sigma_{n-1}$ is the _space of states_ over that manifold. A state is accordingly a [[generalized element]] of this object.

### In AQFT

Dually, in the [[AQFT]] formulation of [[quantum field theory]] a physical system is encoded by a [[local net]] of [[operator algebra]]s. These are to be interpreted as _algebras of observables_ . Since each observable is supposed to have a given value on a given state, a state here is a [[linear functional]] on the operator algebra of observables. For more on this see
