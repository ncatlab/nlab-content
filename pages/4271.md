## Idea

A _state_ is a [[configuration space|configuration]] of a system in [[physics]], together with enough information about its [[time evolution]] (typically, the first derivative is sufficient) to allow one to propagate it arbitrarily.


## Definitions

The precise mathematical notion of _state_ depends on what formalization is used to formalize this statement. 


### In classical mechanics

In simple situations of [[classical mechanics]], a _[[pure state]]_ is a [[global element|point]] in the [[phase space]] of the system, and a _[[mixed state]]_ is a [[probability distribution]] on phase space.

More generally, a _[[classical state]]_ is a [[linear function]] $\rho\colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ on the [[Poisson algebra]] $A$ underlying the [[classical mechanical system]] which satisfies _positivity_ and _normalization_.


### In quantum mechanics

In the simple version of [[quantum mechanics]] given by a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, then a _[[pure state]]_ is a ray in $H$, which we often call the Hilbert space of states.  Strictly speaking, the space of states is not $H$ but $(H \setminus \{0\})/\mathbb{C}$, or equivalently $S(H)/U(1)$.

In the more general case where a [[quantum mechanical system]] is given by a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] $A$, a state is a linear function $\rho\colon A \to \mathbb{C}$ which satisfies _positivity_ and _normalization_. See [[states in AQFT and operator algebra]] for more on this.

It has been argued that more accurately the correct notion is that of [[quasi-state]] instead. See also the Idea-section at [[Bohr topos]] for a discussion of this point.


### In general

In [[statistical physics]], a state may encode less than maximal information.  Fairly generally, we have a complex $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] $A$ of [[observables]] and a __state__ is a positive-semidefinite linear operator $\rho\colon A \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $\rho(1) = 1$.  A state $\rho$ is __pure__ if, whenever we have $\rho = a \sigma + b \tau$ for $\sigma, \tau$ also states and $0 \leq a, b \leq 1$, then either $a = 0$ (hence $b = 1$) or $b = 0$ (hence $a = 1$); conversely, a state $\rho$ is __mixed__ if we ever have $\rho = a \sigma + b \tau$ for $\sigma, \tau$ also states and $0 \lt a, b \lt 1$.

If $A$ is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on some [[compactum]] $X$, then the pure states on $A$ correspond precisely to the points in $X$; so pure states here are the states of classical mechanics (at least for a compact phase space).  Mixed states, however, correspond more generally to [[Radon measure|Radon]] [[probability measures]] on $X$, with the pure states as the [[Dirac delta measure]]s.

On the other hand, if $A$ is the algebra of all [[bounded operators]] on some [[Hilbert space]] $H$, then the pure states on $A$ correspond precisely to the rays in $H$.  Mixed states, however, correspond more generally to [[density matrices]] on $H$, with the pure states those matrices of the form ${|\psi\rangle}{\langle\psi|}$ for some unit vector ${|\psi\rangle}$.

In each case, a pure state is a state of maximal information, while a mixed state is a state with less than maximal information.  In the classical case, we may say that a pure state is a state of *complete* information, but this does not work in the quantum case; from the perspective of the information-theoretic or Bayesian interpretation of quantum physics, this inability to have complete information, even when having maximal information, is the key feature of quantum physics that distinguishes it from classical physics.


### In FQFT

In the [[FQFT]] formulation of [[quantum field theory]], a physical system is given by a [[cobordism]] [[representation]]

$$
  Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

In this formulation the [[k-morphism|(n-1)-morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ assigned to an $(n-1)$-dimensional [[manifold]] $\Sigma_{n-1}$ is the _space of states_ over that manifold. A state is accordingly a [[generalized element]] of this object.
