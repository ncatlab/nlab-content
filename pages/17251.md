
The term _simplicial functor_ is usually used to refer to [[sSet]]-[[enriched functors]], hence to _simplicially enriched functors_, hence to [[morphisms]] between [[simplicially enriched categories]].

In principle, but less commonly so in practice, it may also refer to  a morphism of [[simplicial object in Cat]].
See the discussion at _[[simplicial category]]_.

Another meaning was introduced by [[Manos Lydakis]]:
simplicial functors are [[reduced excisive functors]] from
the category of pointed [[simplicial functors]] (in the first sense above)
from the [[simplicial category]] of [[compact]] [[simplicial sets]]
to the [[simplicial category]] of [[simplicial sets]].
This [[simplicial category]] is equipped with a stable [[model structure]]
that makes it [[Quillen equivalent]] to the Bousfieldâ€“Friedlander
model structure on [[simplicial spectra]].
See [[model structure on reduced excisive functors]] for more information.
