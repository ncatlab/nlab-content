
The term _simplicial functor_ is usually used to refer to [[sSet]]-[[enriched functors]], hence to _simplicially enriched functors_, hence to [[morphisms]] between [[simplicially enriched categories]].

In principle, but less commonly so in practice, it may also refer to  a morphism of [[simplicial object in Cat]].

See the discussion at _[[simplicial category]]_.
