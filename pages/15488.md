Charan continues, "If businesses managed their money as carelessly as they manage their people, most would be bankrupt. But for the great majority of companies, talent management remains hit-or-miss, governed by superficial criteria and outdated concepts, depending as much on luck as on skill." Talent Masters, conversely, review people "as thoroughly and regularly as they review operations, business performance, strategy, and budgets. Once you've seen at a very deep level how companies who do it well make it happen, we provide a Talent Mastery Tool Kit so you can bring this learning to your organization immediately. In the fast-changing global marketplace, talent will be the big difference between companies that succeed and those that don't."
