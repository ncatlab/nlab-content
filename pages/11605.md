Traditionally the $(k+1)$st _intermediate Jacobian variety_ $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ of a [[complex analytic space]] $\Sigma$ is the [[quotient]] of its [[ordinary cohomology]] in degree $2k+1$ with [[real number]] [[coefficients]] by that with [[integer]] coefficients

$$
  J^{k+1}(\Sigma) \coloneqq H^{2k+1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{R}) / H^{2k+1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This space naturally carries the structure of a [[complex manifold]] (in fact two such structures, named after Griffiths and after Weil) and this complex analytic space, which is in fact a _[[complex torus]]_, is properly what is called the $(k+1)$st _intermediate Jacobian variety_ of $\Sigma$. This terminology derives from the term _[[Jacobian variety]]_ which is the (historically earlier) special case for $k = 0$ and $dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma) = 1$.

Notice that conceptually we may

* think of $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})$ as the space of those [[circle n-bundle with connection|n-form connections]] on $\Sigma$ which are both [[flat infinity-connection|flat]] and have trivial underlying [[line n-bundle]];

* think of $H^{2k + 1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z})$ as the group of "large" (not connected to the identity) [[higher gauge field|higher]] [[gauge transformations]] acting on these gauge fields;

* and hence understand $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ as the [[moduli space]] of flat $n$-form connections on trivial underlying line $n$-bundles.

This turns out to be a natural and  useful perspective on intermediate Jacobians: _Deligne's theorem_ (discussed as theorem \ref{DeligneTheorem} below) characterizes the intermediate Jacobians as subgroups of the relevant [[Deligne cohomology]] group of $\Sigma$, where [[Deligne cohomology]] is a model for [[ordinary differential cohomology]] that classifies these [[circle n-bundle with connection|line n-bundles with connection]]. Moreover, as discussed in prop. \ref{ReformulationOfDeligneTheorem} below, Deligne's theorem in the formulation of ([Esnault-Viehweg 88](#EsnaultViehweg88)) may be rephrased such as to manifestly give a formal incarnation of the the statement that $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ is just that subgroup of the Deligne complex given by [[circle n-bundle with connection|line n-connections]] with trivial [[curvature]] and trivial underlying [[line n-bundle]].

This formulation in turn has an evident generalization from [[ordinary differential cohomology]] to general (namely [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod type]]) [[differential cohomology]]. This we discuss further [below](#GeneralDescripion).

This perspective on intermediate Jacobians from [[higher gauge theory]] also faithfully reflects their role in fundamental [[physics]] (in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]]) ([Witten 96](#Witten96), [Hopkins-Singer 02]{#HopkinsSinger02}). Here [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] has as [[field (physics)|fields]] types of [[higher gauge field]] specified by some type of [[differential cohomology]], and the connected components of its [[phase space]] is precisely the corresponding intermediate Jacobian. Moreover the [[transgression]] of the higher Chern-Simons [[action functional]] produces a [[line bundle]] on the intermediate Jacobian, which is the [[prequantum line bundle]] of the theory. By [[geometric quantization]] one has to choose a [[Kähler polarization]] for this line bundle and the Weil complex structure on $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ is precisely that.
In terms of [[complex geometry]] this state of affairs directly translates into the statement that the Weil intermediate Jacobians are [[polarized varieties]]. In fact they are [[principally polarized variety|principally polarized]], which on the physics side corresponds to the [[metaplectic correction]] of the [[Kähler polarization]] used for [[geometric quantization]]. The [[holomorphic section]] of the resulting [[Theta characteristic]] on the intermediate Jacobian is physically the [[partition function]] of [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] on $\Sigma$ (see there for more) which mathematically is the corresponding [[theta function]].

By way of these deep relations intermediate Jacobians play an important role in ([[higher geometry|higher]]) [[geometry]].

### For differential ordinary cohomology
 {#InComplexGeometry}

#### The underlying real manifold

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[projective variety|projective]] [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[complex variety]] (see at _[[GAGA]]_). 

+-- {: .num_defn #PlainIJacobian}
###### Definition

For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the _$k$th intermediate Jacobian_ of $\Sigma$ is, as a [[real manifold]], the [[quotient]]

$$
  J^{k+1}(\Sigma) 
    \coloneqq 
  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})/H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z})
$$

of the [[ordinary cohomology|ordinary]] [[cohomology groups]] of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[abelian groups]] of [[real numbers]] and of [[integers]], respectively, induced by the canonical inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

=--

Here $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})$ is naturally a [[vector space]] over the [[real numbers]] and this is what induces the [[smooth manifold]]-structure on the quotient. 

For eventually equipping this with the structure of a [[complex manifold]] one realizes this as the quotient of the [[complex vector space]] of cohomology with complex coefficients as follows:

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A real [[differential form]] 

$$
  \alpha \in \Omega^{2k+1}_{\mathbb{R}}(\Sigma)
$$

is, by the [[Hodge theorem]], a sum of complex differential forms in homogeneous [[Dolbeault complex|Dolbeault bidegree]] of the form

$$
  \alpha 
    = 
   \alpha^{2k+1,0}+ \alpha^{2k,1} 
     + 
     \cdots 
      + 
     \alpha^{k+1,k}
      +
     \overline{\alpha^{k+1,k}} 
     + 
     \cdots
     +
     \overline{\alpha^{2k,1}} + \overline{\alpha^{2k+1,1}}
  \,,
$$

where

$$
  \overline{(-)} \colon \Omega^{p,q}(\Sigma)\longrightarrow \Omega^{q,p}(\Sigma)
$$

is the [[antilinear function]] on complex differential forms given by [[complex conjugation]].

=--

It follows with the [[de Rham theorem]] that:

+-- {: .num_prop #AsQuotientByHodgeFiltering}
###### Proposition

There is a canonical [[isomorphism]] of real vector spaces

$$
  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{R}) 
   \simeq 
  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})/(F^{k+1} H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C}))
 \,,
$$

where 

$$
  F^{k+1} H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C}) \coloneqq \underset{p \geq k+1}{\oplus} H^{p,2k+1-p}(\Sigma)
$$

is the $(k+1)$st stage in the [[Hodge filtration]] of $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})$. 

=--

Hence an equivalent way to write the intermediate Jacobian (still as a real manifold) as the quotient of the real manifold underlying a complex vector space is the following:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The intermediate Jacobian of def. \ref{PlainIJacobian} is equivalently

$$
  J^{k+1}(\Sigma)
   \simeq 
   H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})
   /
  (F^{k+1} H^{2k+1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{C}) \oplus H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}))
  \,.
$$

Yet one more reformulation is useful when properly working in [[complex analytic geometry]]/[[GAGA]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #ModuliOfHolomorphickConnections}
###### Definition

Write $(\mathbf{B}^k \mathbb{G}_a)_{conn}$ for the chain complex of sheaves on the complex analytic site which assigns the truncated [[de Rham complex]] of [[holomorphic differential forms]]

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^k \mathbb{G}_a)_{conn}
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \mathcal{O}
     \stackrel{\partial }{\to}
    \Omega^{1}
      \stackrel{\partial}{\to}
      \cdots
      \stackrel{\partial}{\to}
    \Omega^{k}
  \right)
$$

regarded as sitting in degrees $k$ to 0.

e.g. ([Esnault-Viehweg 88, top of p. 14](#EsnaultViehweg88))

+-- {: .num_prop #ReplacingHodgeFiltrationQuotientByHolomorphicConnections}
###### Proposition

The quotient in prop. \ref{AsQuotientByHodgeFiltering}
is equivalently the [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian sheaf]] 
[[hypercohomology]] with [[coefficients]]
in $\mathbf{B}^{2k}\mathbb{G}_a$ of def. \ref{ModuliOfHolomorphickConnections}:

$$
  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})/F^{k+1} H^{2k+1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{C})
  \simeq
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^k(\mathbf{B}^k \mathbb{G}_a)_conn) ]
  \,.
$$

=--

e.g. ([Esnault-Viehweg 88, 2.5 b)](#EsnaultViehweg88)).


There are two canonical ways to equip $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})$, and hence the above quotient, with the structure of a [[complex manifold]]. Sometimes these agree, but in general they do not, and hence they go by different names,the 

* [Griffith intermediate Jacobian](#GriffithIntermediateJacobian)

and the


* [Weil intermediate Jacobian](#WeilIntermediateJacobian)


#### Characterization as Hodge-trivial Deligne cohomology
 {#CharacterizationAsHodgeTrivialDeligneCohomology}

A theorem due to [[Pierre Deligne]] says that this $J^k(\Sigma)$ is characterised as being the [[fiber]] of a canonical map from ([[complex analytic geometry|complex analytic]]) [[Deligne cohomology]] to the $k$th [[Hodge filtration]] of [[integral cohomology]]. 


+-- {: .num_defn #HodgeCohomologyClasses}
###### Definition

The group $Hdg^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ of _[[Hodge cocycle|Hodge cohomology classes]]_ is the subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}(k+1)$-cohomology classes whose image in complex cohomology is in the $(k+1)$st stage of the [[Hodge filtration]], hence the group sitting in a [[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
     Hdg^{k+1}(\Sigma) 
       &\longrightarrow& 
     F^{k+1} H^{2k+2}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     H^{2k+2}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}(k+1))
       &\longrightarrow&
     H^{2k+2}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

The following says this in a [[complex analytic geometry|complex analytic]]-way that generalizes:

+-- {: .num_prop #HodgeCyclesAsPullbackOfHolomorphic}
###### Proposition

Equivalently the Hodge cohomology classes of def. \ref{HodgeCohomologyClasses} are given by the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     Hdg^{k+1}(\Sigma) 
       &\longrightarrow& 
     H^{2k+2}(\Sigma, \Omega^{\bullet \geq k+1})
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     H^{2k+2}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}(k+1))
       &\longrightarrow&
     H^{2k+2}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})
  }
  \,,
$$

where now in the top right we have the [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian sheaf]] [[hypercohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the [[holomorphic de Rham complex]], truncated (but otherwise unshifted) as indicated.

=--

([Esnault-Viehweg 88, section 7.8](#EsnaultViehweg88))

+-- {: .num_theorem #DeligneTheorem}
###### Theorem
**(Deligne)**

As an [[abelian group]] the intermediate Jacobian $J^k(\Sigma)$, def. \ref{PlainIJacobian}, is characterized by fitting into the [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to J^{k+1}(\Sigma)\to H^{2k+2}(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z}(k+1)_{D}) \to Hdg^{k+1}(\Sigma) \to 0
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Esnault-Viehweg 88, (7.9)](#EsnaultViehweg88), [Peters-Steenbrink 08, lemma 7.20](#PetersSteenbrink08)) .

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Use prop. \ref{ReplacingHodgeFiltrationQuotientByHolomorphicConnections} and the [characteristic long exact sequences](ordinary%20differential%20cohomology#CurvatureAndCharClass) of [[ordinary differential cohomology]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #AsFiberOf0TruncationOnFractureSquare}
###### Remark

The [[fiber product]]-incarnation of $Hdg^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ in prop. \ref{HodgeCyclesAsPullbackOfHolomorphic} is noteworthy in that it
is analogous to the [[homotopy fiber]]-characterization of the 
holomorphic [[Deligne complex]] itself.

Consider the following [[diagram]] of [[sheaves of chain complexes]]
on the site $SteinSp$ of [[Stein manifolds]] (see at _[[complex analytic ∞-groupoid]]_ for more on this):

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{Z}(p)[-2k-2]
     && &&
     \Omega^{\bullet \geq k+1}[-2k-2]
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && \mathbb{C}[-2k-2]
  }
  \,.
$$

This is just of the form as discussed in some detail at _[[circle n-bundle with connection]]_ and also at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_ in the section on _[Deligne coefficients](differential+cohomology%20diagram#DeligneCoefficients)_. In particular the [[homotopy limit]] over this diagram, hence the [[homotopy fiber]] of the two maps is a version of the [[Deligne complex]]

$$
  \array{
     &&\mathbb{Z}(p)_D[-2k-2]
     \\
     && = 
     \\
     &&(\mathbb{Z}(p) \to \mathcal{O} \to \Omega^1 \to \cdots \to \Omega^{k} \to 0 \to \cdots)[-2k-2]
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}(p)[-2k-2]
     && (hpb) &&
     \Omega^{\bullet \geq k+1}[-2k-2]
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && \mathbb{C}[-2k-2]
  }
  \,.
$$

Since [[homotopy pullbacks]] are preserved by foming [[mapping spaces]] into them, this statement holds true after evaluating on $\Sigma$ (which produces the [[Cech cohomology|Cech-]][[Deligne complexes]]). Forming the [[n-truncated object of an (infinity,1)-category|0-truncation]] $\tau_0$ of the result gives the differential cohomology group $H^{2k+2}(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z}(k+1)_{D})$ 
appearing in theorem \ref{DeligneTheorem}.

Alternatively, first passing the 0-truncation of the diagram and then producing the pullback yields the Hodge cocycle group of prop. \ref{HodgeCyclesAsPullbackOfHolomorphic}.

Accordingly, the statement of theorem \ref{DeligneTheorem} may equivalently be rephrased in the following more suggestive way:

the intermediate Jacobian $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$ is the [[fiber]] in

$$
  J^{k+1}(\Sigma)
   \longrightarrow
  \tau_0\left(
     [\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}(p)[-2k-2]]
     \underset{[\Sigma, \mathbb{C}[-2k-2]]}{\times}
     \Omega^{\bullet \geq k+1}[-2k-2]
  \right)
  \longrightarrow
  \tau_0 [\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}(p)[-2k-2]]
   \underset{\tau_0 [\Sigma, \mathbb{C}[-2k-2]]}{\times}
  \tau_0 [\Sigma, \Omega^{\bullet \geq k+1}[-2k-2]]
  \,.
$$

=--

This formulation of the intermediate Jacobian has a
straightforward generalization from [[ordinary differential cohomology]] to [[differential cohomology|differential]] [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]. This we turn to [below](#GeneralDescripion).


#### The Griffith complex structure
 {#GriffithIntermediateJacobian}

The [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma , \mathbb{C})
  \simeq 
  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma , \mathbb{R})\otimes_{\mathbb{R}} (\mathbb{C})
$$

induces a [[complex manifold]] structure on $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma , \mathbb{C})$ and hence the structure of a [[complex torus]] on $k$th intermediate Jacobian as defined above. This is the structure originally defined in ([Griffiths 68a](#Griffiths68a), [Griffiths 68b](#Griffiths68b)) and hence called the _Griffith intermediate Jacobian_.  Reviews include ([Walls 12](#Walls12), [Esnault-Viehweg 88, section 7.8](#EsnaultViehweg88)).


#### The Weil complex structure
 {#WeilIntermediateJacobian}

There is another natural [[complex structure]] on $H^{2k-1}(X, \mathbb{R})/H^{2k-1}(X, \mathbb{Z})$, equipped with that it is called the _Weil intermediate Jacobian_.

Let as before $n \coloneqq dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma) $.
Choose a [[Hermitian manifold]] structure on $\Sigma$. Then [[Serre duality]] on forms of total odd degree

$$
  \bar \star \;\colon\; \Omega^{p,2k+1-p}(\Sigma) \longrightarrow \Omega^{n-p-2k-1,p}(\Sigma)
$$

is an [[antilinear function]] which squares to -1. Therefore

$$
 i \bar \star \;\colon\;  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C}) \to  H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})
$$

is a [[real structure]] on $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})$. This hence defines a [[complex manifold]] structure on $H^{2k+1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{C})$ and hence on the above [[quotient]] which is the intermediate Jacobian $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$. As such this is the _Weil intermediate Jacobian_.

#### The polarized mid-dimensional Weil (Lazzeri) intermediate Jacobian
 {#MidDimensionalWeilIntermediateJacobian}

The Weil intermediate Jacobian is particularly interesting in mid degree, hence if

$$
  n =dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma) = 2k+1
$$

then for $J^{k+1}(\Sigma)$. This case is also known as _Lazzeri's Jacobians_ see ([Rubei 98](#Rubei98)).

In this case the [[intersection pairing]] 

$$
  (\alpha, \beta) \mapsto \int_{\Sigma}\alpha \wedge \beta
$$

defines a [[symplectic form]], for which the [[Hodge star]] operator is a compatible [[complex structure]] and hence the [[Serre duality]]-pairing

$$
  (\alpha, \beta) \mapsto \int_{\Sigma}\alpha \wedge \star \beta
$$

is the corresponding [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]]. This makes the Weil intermediate Jacobian a [[polarized variety]].

Notice that the holomorphic coordinates in

$$
  ker \tfrac{1}{2}( 1 + i \bar \star  ) \in H^{2k+1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{C})
$$

may be thought of as the mid-degree [[self-dual higher gauge fields]] on $\Sigma$. From this point of view the above is the [[Kähler polarization]] of the [[prequantum line bundle]] on [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in dimension $4k+3$.


#### The intermediate Jacobian of a Hodge structure

By prop. \ref{AsQuotientByHodgeFiltering} above
the intermediate Jacobian is defined by the canonical 
[[Hodge filtering]] on complex [[ordinary cohomology]].
The definition obtained this way directly generalizes to 
other [[Hodge structures]] $H$ and hence one
speaks more generally of the intermediate Jacobian

$$
  J(H)= H_{\mathbb{C}}/(H_\mathbb{Z}\oplus F^{k+1})
$$

if $H$ has weight $2k+1$.

(e.g. [Peters-Steenbrink 08, example 3.30, section 7.1.2](#PetersSteenbrink08))


### For differential generalized cohomology
 {#GeneralDescripion}

#### General construction

> under construction, see also ([Hopkins-Quick 12](#HopkinsQuick12))...

The formulation of the traditional intermediate 
Jacobian by remark \ref{AsFiberOf0TruncationOnFractureSquare}
above suggest the following generalization.

(We use notation from _[[differential cohomology hexagon]]_).

Given any [[differential cohomology]] [[spectrum]] $\hat E$ (hence a [[spectrum object]]) in a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, it sits in its [[differential cohomology hexagon]] part of which is the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    && \flat_{dR} \hat E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\theta_{\hat E}}}\nearrow && \searrow
    \\
    \hat E && && \Pi \flat_{dR} \hat E
    \\
    & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ch_{\hat E}}}
    \\
    && \Pi \hat E
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence for any $\Sigma$ also the [[mapping spectra]]

$$
  \array{
    && [\Sigma, \flat_{dR} \hat E]
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\theta_{\hat E}}}\nearrow && \searrow
    \\
    [\Sigma, \hat E] && && [\Sigma, \Pi \flat_{dR} \hat E]
    \\
    & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ch_{\hat E}}}
    \\
    && [\Sigma, \Pi \hat E]
  }
  \,.
$$


Write $\tau_0 \colon \mathbf{H}\to \mathbf{H}$ for the [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|0-truncation]] map and consider the [[fiber product]] $Hdg(\Sigma,E)$ in

$$
  \array{
    && \tau_0 [\Sigma, \flat_{dR} \hat E]
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\theta_{\hat E}}}\nearrow && \searrow
    \\
    Hdg(\Sigma,\hat E) && && \tau_0 [\Sigma, \Pi \flat_{dR} \hat E]
    \\
    & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ch_{\hat E}}}
    \\
    && \tau_0[\Sigma, \Pi \hat E]
  }
  \,.
$$

We may call this the _Hodge cohomology_ of $\Sigma$ with coefficients in $\hat E$.
The evident morphism of diagrams induces a morphism

$$
  [\Sigma, \hat E]\longrightarrow Hdg(\Sigma, \hat E)
$$

and the [[homotopy fiber]] of that 

$$
  \mathbf{J}(\Sigma,\hat E)
    \longrightarrow  
   [\Sigma, \hat E]\longrightarrow Hdg(\Sigma, \hat E)
$$

we may call the _intermediate Jacobian $\infty$-stack_ of $\Sigma$ with coefficients in $\hat E$.

Notice that by commutativity of [[homotopy pullbacks]] with [[homotopy fibers]], this is equivalently the homotopy pullback in

$$
  \array{
    && ker([\Sigma,\flat_{dR}\hat E] \to \tau_0[\Sigma,\flat_{dR}\hat E] )
    \\
    & \nearrow && \searrow
    \\
    \mathbf{J}(\Sigma,\hat E) && && ker([\Sigma,\Pi \flat_{dR}\hat E] \to \tau_0[\Sigma,\Pi \flat_{dR}\hat E] )

    \\
    & \searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && ker([\Sigma,\Pi\hat E] \to \tau_0[\Sigma,\Pi\hat E] )
  }
  \,.
$$

In this form this manifestly says that $\mathbf{J}(\Sigma,\hat E)$ is precisely the differential cohomology theory of $\Sigma$ obtained from $\hat E$ by restricting to trivial curvature and trivial underlying $\Pi(E)$-cohomology.

#### For complex K-theory 
 {#ForComplexKTheory}

Intermediate Jacobians of [[K-theory]] classes were considered in the [[physics]]-style literature in ([Witten 99, section 4.3](#Witten99), [Moore-Witten 99, section 3](#MooreWitten99), [DMW 00, section 7.1](#MW00), [Belov-Moore 06b, section 5](#BelovMooreII)) as a means for [[quantization]] of the [[RR-field]] in [[type II superstring theory]] as a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] (see there at _[Examples -- RR-fields in 10d](self-dual%20higher%20gauge%20theory#RRFieldsin10d)_). A mathematical discussion inspired by this is in ([MPS 11](#MPS11)).





## Properties

### Relation between the Griffiths and the Weil complex structure
 {#RelationBetweenGriffithsAndWeilStructure}

While the Griffiths complex structure on the intermediate Jacobian is not Kähler/not an [[polarized variety|algebraic polarization]] as the Weil complex structure is, it still has an [[p-convex polarization]] and there is a [[symplectomorphism]] which is an [[isomorphism]] between the Griffiths and the Weil intermediate Jacobians as real symplectic manifolds

$$
  (J^{k+1}(X), \omega_{Griffiths})
  \simeq
  (J^{k+1}(X), \omega_{Weil})
  \,.
$$

This is due to ([Griffiths 68b](#Griffiths68b)), recalled as [Griffiths 12 (2.6)](#Griffiths12)

(...)

### Cycle map / Abel-Jacobi map

The intermediate Jacobians receive canonical maps from cycles (...)
See at _[[Abel-Jacobi map]]_.

### Polarization

For a [[Hodge manifold]] the intermediate Jacobian canonically inherits the structure of a [[polarized variety]]. (...)


### Theta-characteristics

A certain [[square root]] of the [[canonical bundle]] on intermediate Jacobians -- hence a [[Theta characteristic]] -- in dimension $2k+1$ thought of as [[moduli spaces]] of (flat) [[circle n-bundles with connection|circle (2k+1)-bundles with connection]] yields the [[partition function]] of [[self-dual higher gauge theory]].  ([Witten 96](#Witten96), [Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02)).


### Relation to Artin-Matur formal groups
 {#RelationToArtinMazurFormalGroups}

By theorem \ref{DeligneTheorem} the [[formal geometry]]
of intermediate Jacobians around their canonical point is equivalently the [[deformation theory]] of [[Deligne cohomology]]/[[line n-bundles with connection]]. This is given by (when it exists) the [[Artin-Mazur formal group]]
for [deformations of Deligne cohomology](Artin-Mazur+formal+group#DeformationsOfDeligneCohomology) (see there).

## Examples

The two extreme cases of intermediate Jacobians $J^k(\Sigma)$ with minimal $k = 0$ and maximal $k = dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma)= 1$ go by special names, the

* [Picard variety](#ExamplePicard)

* [Albanese variety](#ExampleAlbanese)

respectively.

### $k = 0$: the Picard variety $J^1(\Sigma)$
 {#ExamplePicard}

+-- {: .num_prop #J1IsPicard}
###### Proposition

The intermediate Jacobian $J^1(\Sigma)$, def. \ref{PlainIJacobian}, of a [[complex curve]] ($dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma) = 1$) coincides with the connected component $Pic_0(\Sigma)$ of the [[Picard variety]] $Pic(\Sigma)$ of $\Sigma$, hence with the [[Jacobian variety]] $Jac(\Sigma)$:

$$
  J^1(\Sigma) = Pic_0(\Sigma) = Jac(\Sigma)
  \,.
$$

=--

First consider the elementary proof by direct inspection (e.g. [Polishchuk 03, section 16.4](#Polishchuk03)):

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that the canonical map 

$$
  H^1(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})
  \hookrightarrow 
  H^1(\Sigma, \mathbb{C})
  \to
  H^{0,1}(\Sigma)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H^1(\Sigma, \mathcal{O}_{\Sigma})
$$ 

is an [[isomorphism]]. The first map is induced by the splitting $H^1(\Sigma, \mathbb{C}) \simeq H^1(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})\oplus i H^1(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})$ given by [[complexification]] and the second by the splitting $H^1(\Sigma,\mathbb{C}) \simeq H^{0,1}(\Sigma)\oplus H^{1,0}(\Sigma)$ of [[Dolbeault cohomology]], the last map is the [[Dolbeault isomorphism]].

Therefore by the [[long exact sequence in cohomology]] of the [[exponential exact sequence]] we have that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  J^1(\Sigma)
  & \coloneqq
  H^1(\Sigma, \mathbb{R})/H^1(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z})
  \\
  & \simeq
  H^1(\Sigma,\mathcal{O}_{\Sigma})/H^1(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z}) 
  \\
  & \simeq
  ker(H^1(\Sigma, \mathcal{O}^\times_{\Sigma})\to H^2(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z}))
  \\
  & = 
  Pic_0(\Sigma)
  \end{aligned}
$$

is the connected component of the [[Picard variety]] of $\Sigma$.

=--

Alternatively, prop. \ref{J1IsPicard}
derives from theorem \ref{DeligneTheorem} as follows:

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $k = 0$ then $\mathbf{B}^2\mathbb{Z}(k+1)_D\simeq \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_m$ is just the universal moduli stack of line bundles without connection and so $H^{2k+2}(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z}(k+1)_D ) \simeq H(\Sigma,\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_m)$ is the full [[Picard variety]]. The fiber in the exact sequence in theorem \ref{DeligneTheorem} then restricts this to the elements which have trivial [[first Chern class]], hence the [[Jacobian variety]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #GeneralizationToModuliOfGPrincipalConnections}
###### Remark

There is a [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] generalization of this statement that the [[moduli space of flat connections|moduli space of]] real bundles with flat connections is equivalently a moduli space of complex-analytic bundles, but without connection. This is a corollary of the [[Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem]] (for $dim_{\mathbb{C}}\Sigma = 1$) or of the [[Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem]] (for [[Kähler manifolds]] $\Sigma$) and generally of the [[Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence]] (for arbitrary complex $\Sigma$), stated for instance as ([Scheinost-Schottenloher 96, corollary 1.16](#ScheinostSchottenloher96)):

the moduli space of [[flat connection|flat]] [[special unitary group|SU(n)]]-[[principal connections]] on $\Sigma$ is equivalently the moduli space of [[special linear group|SL(n,C)]]-[[holomorphic vector bundles]] which have vanishing [[Chern classes]] and are [[stable vector bundle|semi-stable]].

### $k = n-1$: Albanese variety 
 {#ExampleAlbanese}

For $\Sigma$ any space of complex dimension 
$n \coloneqq dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Sigma)$ then 
with $k = n-1$ the $(k+1)$st intermediate Jacobian 
is built from cohomology in degree one less than the real dimension of $\Sigma$:

$$
  J^{n-1}(\Sigma) = H^{2k-1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{R})/H^{2k-1}(\Sigma, \mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This $(n-1)$st intermediate Jacobian ia known as the _[[Albanese variety]]_ of $\Sigma$.


### Of Calabi-Yau varieties
 {#ExampleCY}

A review of intermediate Jacobians of [[Calabi-Yau varieties]] of ([[complex manifold|complex]]) [[dimension]] 3 is in ([Baarsma 11, section 2](#Baarsma11)).

The (real) dimensional of the intermediate Jacobian of a CY3 $X$ is 

$$
  dim (J(X)) = 2(1+ h^{1,2})
$$

(e.g. [Baarsma 11, (2.21)](#Baarsma11))

Hence the intermediate Jacobian of a rigid CY3 (with $h^{1,2} = 0$) is an [[elliptic curve]] (e.g. [BKNPP 09, (1.8)](#BKNPP09)).

### $n = 3$: supergravity C-field
