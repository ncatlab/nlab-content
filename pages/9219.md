The action functional is real valued. Path integral is defined for such real action functionals. The Wiener integral is an analogue which is well defined in statistics and which is like an analogue for imaginary values of action functional.

Recently, some considerations were given to general complex valued functional arising from the analytic continuation of the real case. This research is related to the study of the [[wall crossing]], [[Stokes phenomenon]] for path integrals, to the [[complex Chern-Simons theory]] and so on.
