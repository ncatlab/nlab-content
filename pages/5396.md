## Idea

There is a statement and proof of [[Gelfand duality]] in [[constructive mathematics]]. This therefore makes sense in any [[topos]].

## Examples

* An application of constructive Gelfand duality in the [[presheaf topos]] over the [[semilattice of commutative subalgebras]] of a [[C-star algebra]] produces an internal [[locale]] from any noncommmutative $C^*$-algebra. See [[semilattice of commutative subalgebras]].

## References

A proof of Gelfand duality claimed to be constructive was given in.

This uses however [[Barr's theorem]] which requires itself non-constructive logic and requires the ambient topos to be a [[Grothendieck topos]]
