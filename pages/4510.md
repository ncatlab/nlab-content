## Idea

In the context of [[homological algebra]] the [[right derived functor]] of the [[hom-functor]] is called the _$Ext$-functor_ . It derives its name from the fact that the derived hom between [[abelian groups]] classifies [[group extensions]] of $A$ by $K$. (This is a special case of the general classificaton of [[principal ∞-bundles]]/[[∞-group extensions]] by general [[cohomology]]/[[group cohomology]].)

Together with the [[Tor]]-functor it is one of the central objects of interest in homological algebra.

## Definition

Given an [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$ we may consider the [[hom-functor]] $Hom_{\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{A}^{op}\times \mathcal{A}\to $[[Ab]] either as a functor in first or in second argument, and compute the corresponding [[right derived functors]]. 

If they exist, the classical right derived functors of either functor agree and also agree with the [[homology]] of the mixed [[double complex]] obtained by taking simultaneously an  [[injective resolution]] of the first contravariant argument and [[projective resolution]] of the second covariant argument. The last construction is called the _balanced $Ext$._

Alternatively, one can consider the [[derived category]] $D(\mathcal{A})$ and define 

$$
  Ext^p(X,A) \coloneqq Hom_{D(A)}(X,A[p])
$$

or define $Ext^i$-groups as groups of extensions of length $i$, discussed below at _[Relation to group extensions](#RelationToGroupExtensions)_.

## Application in cohomoloy

The _[[universal coefficient theorem]]_ identifies, under suitable conditions, [[cohomology]] to the [[duality|dual]] of [[homology]] up to $Ext^1$-groups.

Various notions of [[cohomology groups]] in the context of [[algebra]] can be expressed as $Ext$-groups, for instance

* For $G$ a [[discrete group]] with $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ its [[group ring]], over the [[integers]], and for $N$ a linear $G$-[[representation]], hence a $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-[[module]], the [[group cohomology]] of $G$ with [[coefficients]] in $N$ is 
  
  $$
    Ext^\bullet_{\mathbb{Z}[G]Mod}(\mathbb{Z}[G], N)
    \,.
  $$

* For $A$ an [[associative algebra]] over some [[field]] $k$ and $N$ an $A$-[[bimodule]], hence an $A \otimes A^{op}$-[[module]], 

  $$
    Ext^\bullet_{(A \otimes A^{op})Mod}(A, N) 
  $$

  is the [[Hochschild cohomology]] of $A$ with [[coefficients]] in $N$.

* For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]] with [[universal enveloping algebra]] $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{g})$ and $N$ a Lie algebra module, hence an $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})$-module, the [[Lie algebra cohomology]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ with [[coefficients]] in $N$ is

  $$
    Ext^\bullet_{\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g}) Mod}(\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g}), N)
    \,.
  $$
