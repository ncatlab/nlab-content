## Idea

In the context of [[homological algebra]] the right [[derived functor]] of the [[hom-functor]] is called the _$Ext$-functor_ . It derives its name from the fact that the derived hom $Ext(A,K)$ between [[abelian group]]s classifies [[group extension]]s of $A$ by $K$. 

(This is really a special case of the general discussion at [[cohomology]] and [[group cohomology]].)

Together with the [[Tor]]-functor it is one of the central objects of interest in homological algebra.

## Details

Given an [[abelian category]] $A$ we may consider the [[hom-functor]] $Hom_A : A^{op}\times A\to Ab$ either as a functor in first or in second variable, and compute the corresponding right [[derived functor]]s. If they exist, the classical right derived functors of either functor agree and also agree with the [[homology]] of the mixed [[double complex]] obtained by taking simultaneously an injective [[resolution]] of the first contravariant argument and projective resolution of the second covariant argument. The last construction is called the balanced $Ext$.

Alternatively, one can consider the [[derived category]] $D(A)$ and define 

$$
Ext^i(M,N) := Hom_{D(A)}(M,N[i])
$$

or define $Ext^i$-groups as groups of extensions of length $i$.
