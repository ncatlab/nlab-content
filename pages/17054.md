## Idea

In [[representation theory]] a _norm map_ is a canonical morphism from [[coinvariants]] to [[invariants]] of a given [[action]] which, in suitably well behaved cases is given by [[group averaging]].

For [[∞-actions]] of [[finite groups]] $G$ on objects $E$ in [[stable (∞,1)-categories]], then the [[homotopy cofiber]] $X^{t G}$ of the norm map is called the _[[Tate construction]]_, sitting in a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  X_G \longrightarrow X^G \longrightarrow X^{t G}
  \,.
$$


(e.g [Lurie, def. 6.1.6.24](#Lurie))

For the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] this is accordingly called the _[[Tate spectrum]]_.
