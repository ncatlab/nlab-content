## Idea 

The **Gray tensor product** is a "better" replacement for the cartesian product of [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]].  To get the idea it suffices to consider the 2-category $\mathbf{2}$ which has two objects, 0 and 1, one non-identity morphism $0\to 1$, and no nonidentity 2-cells. Then the cartesian product $\mathbf{2}\times\mathbf{2}$ is a commuting square, while the Gray tensor product $\mathbf{2}\otimes\mathbf{2}$ is a square which commutes up to isomorphism.

More generally, for any 2-categories $C$ and $D$, a 2-functor $C\times\mathbf{2} \to D$ consists of two 2-functors $C\to D$ and a strict 2-natural transformation between them, while a 2-functor $C\otimes\mathbf{2} \to D$ consists of two 2-functors $C\to D$ and a _pseudonatural_ transformation between them.

## Definition 

Following up on the last comment, $B\otimes C$ can be defined by
$$ 2Cat(B\otimes C, D) \cong 2Cat(B, Ps(C,D)) $$
where $Ps(C,D)$ is the 2-category of 2-functors, pseudonatural transformations, and modifications $C\to D$.  In other words, the category 2Cat of strict 2-categories  and strict 2-functors is a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], whose tensor product is $\otimes$ and whose internal hom is $Ps(-,-)$.

## Remarks 

* When considered with this monoidal structure, 2Cat is often called Gray.  [[Gray-category|Gray-categories]], or categories [[enriched category|enriched]] over Gray, are a model for [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strict]] 3-categories.  Categories enriched over 2Cat with its cartesian product are _strict_ 3-categories, which are not as useful.  This is one precise sense in which the Gray tensor product is "more correct" than the cartesian product.

* Gray is a rare example of a non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] monoidal category whose unit object is nevertheless the terminal object --- that is, a [[semicartesian monoidal category]].

* There are also versions of the Gray tensor product in which pseudonatural transformations are replaced by lax or oplax ones.  (In fact, these were the ones originally defined by Gray.)

* Gray is actually a monoidal [[model category]] (that is, a model category with a monoidal structure that interacts well with the model structure), which 2Cat with the cartesian product is not.  In particular, the cartesian product of two cofibrant 2-categories need not be cofibrant.  This is another precise sense in which the Gray tensor product is "more correct" than the cartesian product.

* The cartesian monoidal structure is sometimes called the "black"  product, since the square $2\times 2$ is "completely filled in" (i.e. it commutes).  There is another "white" tensor product in which the square $2\Box 2$ is "not filled in at all" (doesn't commute at all), and the "gray" tensor product is in between the two (the square commutes up to an isomorphism).  This is a pun on the name of John Gray who gave his name to the Gray tensor product.

* There are generalizations to [[higher category theory|higher categories]] of the Gray tensor product. In particular there is a tensor product on [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] -- the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]] -- which is such that restricted to strict 2-categories it reproduces the Gray tensor product.

* A  [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal structure]] on [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] is introduced by Al-Agl, Brown and Steiner. This uses an equivalence between the categories of strict (globular) omega categories and of strict  cubical omega categories with connections; the construction of the closed  monoidal  structure on the latter category is direct and generalises that for strict cubical omega groupoids with connections established by Brown and Higgins.
