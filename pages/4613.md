## Idea

In its most refined form, a _secondary characteristic class_ is a [[characteristic class]] in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. The term "secondary" refers to the fact that such a differential cohomology class in degree $n$ not only encodes a degree-$n$ class in [[integral cohomology]], but in addition [[connection on an infinity-bundle|higher connection data]] in degree $(n+1)$: the data of a [[circle n-bundle with connection]].

The refined [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] takes values in such "secondary characteristic classes".

But the precise meaning of the term _secondary characteristic class_ varies a little in the literature, as follows. Historically it was first understood in more restricted senses.

1. In the strict sense of the word, a _secondary characteristic class_ is a characteristic of a situation where an ordinary [[characteristic class]] vanishes ([PetersonStein1962](#PetersonStein)).

1. More specifically, a special case of this situation in [[differential geometry]] arises where the [[characteristic class]] is represented in [[de Rham cohomology]] by a [[curvature characteristic form]]. If that curvature form happens to vanish, the corresponding [[Chern-Simons form]] itself becomes closed, and now itself represents a cohomology class, in one degree lower. This is often called the corresponding _Chern-Simons secondary characteristic class_ . Sometimes the term "secondary geometric invariants" is used for [[Chern-Simons form]]s (see for instance the review ([FreedII](#FreedCSII))).

1. Using refined [[Chern-Weil theory]] the notions of [[curvature characteristic form]]s and their [[Chern-Simons form]]s are unified into the notion of cocycles in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. The notion of [[Cheeger-Simons differential character]] was introduced to describe this unification, and it is has become tradition to call these differential characters themselves _secondary characteristic classes_ independently of whether the corresponding ordinary [[characteristic class]]/[[curvature characteristic form]] vanishes or not (for instance ([DupontKamber](#Kamber), [Karlsson](#Karlsson)). More descriptively, this case is maybe better referred to as a _[[differential characteristic class]]_ . See there for more details.
