## Idea

In the strict sense of the word, a _secondary characteristic class_ is a characteristic of a situation where an ordinary [[characteristic class]] vanishes ([PetersonStein1962](#PetersonStein)).

More specifically, a specical case of this situation in [[differential geometry]] arises where the [[characteristic class]] is represented in [[de Rham cohomology]] by a [[curvature characteristic form]]. If that curvature form happens to vanish, the corresponding [[Chern-Simons form]] itself becomes closed, and now itself represents a cohomology class, in one degree lower. This is often called the corresponding _Chern-Simons secondary characteristic class_ . Sometimes the term "secondary geometric invariants" is used for [[Chern-Simons form]]s (see for instance the review ([FreedII](#FreedCSII))).

Using refined [[Chern-Weil theory]] the notions of [[curvature characteristic form]]s and their [[Chern-Simons form]]s are unified into the notion of cocycles in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. The notion of [[Cheeger-Simons differential character]] was introduced to describe this unification, and it is has become tradition to call these differential characters themselves _secondary characteristic classes_ independently of whether the corresponding ordinary [[characteristic class]]/[[curvature characteristic form]] vanishes or not (for instance ([DupontKamber](#Kamber), [Karlsson](#Karlsson)).
