#Idea#

The _homotopy coherent nerve_ (also called _simplicial nerve_) of a [[simplicially enriched category]] is a [[simplicial set]] which includes information about all the higher homotopies present in the hom-spaces.  It generalizes the ordinary [[nerve]] of an ordinary [[category]].


#Preliminary definitions#

For $\Delta^n$ the standard [[simplicial set|simplicial]] $n$-[[simplex]], define the [[simplicially enriched category]] $S[\Delta^n]$ as follows:

* the objects of $S[\Delta^n]$ are $\{0,1, \cdots, n\}$;

* for $i, j \in \{0,1,\cdots, n\}$ define  $S[\Delta^n](i,j) = \left\lbrace \array{ \emptyset & if j \lt i \\ N(P_{i,j}) & if i \leq j }\right.$     
  where $P_{i,j}$ is the [[poset]]  $\left\{ I \subset J : (i,j \in I) \wedge (\forall k \in I) [i \leq k \leq j] \right\}$.  

  This interprets as the simplicial set of paths from $i$ to $j$. For such a path the corresponding $I$ is the set of vertices visited by the path, so $I\subset J$ means that the path for $J$ is a 'subdivided' version of that for $I$. The simplicial set $N(P_{i,j})$ is isomorphic to the $j-i-1$ cube $\Delta[1]^{j-i-1}$. (We will look at an example after this definition.)

* the composition operation is induced by 'composition of the corresponding paths' and thus essentially by union of the sets involved.

#Example and (hopefully) explanation#

We will examine the lowest dimensional cases. For $n = 0,1$, there is nothing of note.

For $n = 2$, there are unique paths in $[2]$ from $[0]$ to $[1]$, and $[1]$ to $[2]$, so the corresponding homs in $S[2]$ are copies of $\Delta[0]$ (or, if you prefer, of $\Delta[1]^0$!). Things are slightly more interesting for $S[2](0,2)$. Looking at this from the 'subsets' viewpoint, as above, there clearly are two subsets of $\{0,1,2\}$ containing both $0$ and $2$, one corresponds to the direct route in $[2]$ from $0$ to $2$, the other goes via $1$ so is $0\to 1\to 2$. In $S[2](0,2)$, there is a 1-simplex starting at $\{0,2\}$ and ending at $\{0,1,2\}$.  
 Everything else, in higher dimensions, is degenerate, so $S[2](0,2)\cong \Delta[1]$. Sometimes it is useful to think of this 1-simplex as 'rewriting' the direct path to that via 1, all this happening in the free category on the underlying graph of the poset $[2]$. 

In this example there are no significant compositions. To see examples of those, you need to look at $n = 3$. In $S[3]$, the simplicial hom-sets $S[3](i,j)$ for $(i,j) \neq (0,3)$, can all be analysed by the same sort of argument to the above.  The new features occur in $S[3](0,3)$.  The vertices of this simplicial set are the subsets $\{ 0.3\}$, $\{0,1,3\}$, $\{0,2,3\}$, and  $\{0,1,2,3\}$, corresponding to the direct path $0\to 3$ and then the three other. Rewriting the direct path can be done in two immediate ways, to go via 1 or via 2. Each of these can be 'rewritten' to give the longest path /  largest subset. There is also, of course, an inclusion of the smalles to the largest of these:
$$
  \array{
     \{0,3\}&\rightarrow & \{0,1,3\}
     \\
     \downarrow & \searrow &\downarrow\\
     \{0,2,3\}&\rightarrow &\{0,1,2,3\}
   }
$$
In addition, there will be 2-simplexes filling the two triangles, coming from the chains $\{0,3\}\subset \{0,1,3\}\subset \{0,1,2,3\}$ and $\{0,3\}\subset \{0,2,3\}\subset \{0,1,2,3\}$ in the poset. We thus get $S[3](0,3) \cong \Delta[1]^2$, a square. 

The composition maps

$$S[3](1,3)\times S[3](0,1)\to S[3](0,3)$$

and similarly for the one with 1 replaced by 2, *are* now fairly obvious.  



For $n = 4$, the corresponding diagram for $S[4](0,4)$ gives a cube (left to the reader), but here there is an interesting feature.  The 4-simplex has five 3-dimensional faces and each will give one 2-dimensional face of that cube.  A cube has six 2-dimensional faces. The 'extra' sixth face corresponds to the interchange law, or, if preferred, to the fact that

$$S[4](2,4)\times S[4](0,2)\to S[4](0,4)$$

is to be a simplicial map.

A similar phenomenon occurs in higher dimensions.  There are two 'extra faces' in $S[5](0,5)$, and so on.


##Remark##

We will return to other thoughts on this $S$ construction later in the entry.


One of the reasons for discussing the above is the following:

#Definition#

For $C$ a [[simplicially enriched category]], the **homotopy coherent nerve**  $N(C)$ is the [[simplicial set]] uniquely characterized by the formula $ Hom_{SSet}(\Delta^n, N(C)) = Hom_{SSet-Cat}(S[\Delta^n], C)$.


#Remarks#

* The simplicial nerve, together with its [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]], serves to relate the two models of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] given by [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] and [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]].

# Discussion #

The following discussion was at [[simplicial nerve]] when this page was at [[simplicial nerve of simplicial categories]].

Is there a simplicial nerve that\'s not of simplicial categories?  If not, I\'d put the article here instead of there.  ---Toby

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: yes, it seems to be called just "simplicial nerve" in the literature, but I found that a bit undescriptive, since every nerve is "simplicial" and here the point is really that we take the nerve _of_ a simplicial category. I also seem to recall that [[Tim Porter|Tim]] said he doesn't like the term "simplicial nerve". Maybe Tim should decide, he is probably the one among us who has thought about this notion the most.

_Toby_:  Ah, I see how 'simplicial nerve' is confusing; so how about just [[nerve of a simplicial category]]?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: right, that might be the best option -- I have to run now, maybe you can implement that?

_Toby_:  I\'ll wait to hear from Tim.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Not all nerves are simplicial; it depends on what you are taking the nerve of.  The nerve of a multicategory is a dendroidal set (a presheaf on the category of trees).  The nerve of a compact symmetric multicategory is a presheaf on the category of Feynman graphs.  And an $n$-category has a nerve that is a simplicial set, but also one that is a $\Theta_n$-set and one that is an $n$-fold simplicial set.

FWIW, I have sometimes seen the "simplicial nerve of simplicial categories" called the "homotopy coherent nerve," which to me captures the intuition better.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: true, I actually know that not every notion of nerve is simplicial, should have thought before typing. 

Now that you mention it, maybe [[Tim Porter]] also said he favored "homotopy coherent nerve"? I'll send him an email.

[[Tim Porter|Tim]]:  Back from a short absence: the term 'homotopy coherent nerve' is probably a good one only when it fairly directly relates to homotopy coherence. 

Any 2-category can be thought of as a simplicially enriched category and the Duskin nerve of a bicategory specialises to the same construction on 2-categories. Various people use the term 'geometric nerve' for this. (It is interesting to compare the 'simplicial nerve' of a simplicial group (as SSet-enriched category) with Wbar of the same thing.) I am trying to write something for the Menagerie that looks at the h.c. nerve with these aspects accentuated and also with links with Behrang Noohi's weak maps of crossed modules. I may put some of this on nLab when I see more clearly how it all fits together.  

In the meantime, I suggest we keep the term h.c. nerve although it is probably not 'best possible'.
I agree that 'simplicial nerve'  is probably not a good term.
