## Definition

A [[Kan fibration]] that at the same time is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] is called an **acyclic Kan fibration**. (Also a _trivial Kan fibration_.)

## Properties

Acyclic Kan fibrations are precisely the morphisms of [[simplicial sets]] that have the [[right lifting property]] against all [[boundary of a simplex|simplex boundary inclusions]].

They are the [[acyclic fibrations]] in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].
