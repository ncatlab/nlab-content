## Idea ##

Dendroidal sets are to [[operad]]s and [[(∞,1)-operad]]s as [[simplicial set]]s are to [[category|categories]] and [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].

A dendroidal set is something that consists of [[tree category|trees]] in the way a [[simplicial set]] consists of [[simplex|simplices]]: the trees represent the [[free construction|free]] [[Set]]-[[operads]] over them, and so a dendroidal set is a structure defined as having consistent probes by free $Set$-operads.

More precisely, the [[category]] $dSet$ of dendroidal sets serves to complete the following [[commuting diagram]] of [[functors]]

$$
  \array{
    Cat &\hookrightarrow& Operad
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{N}}\downarrow &&
    {}^{\mathllap{N_d}}\downarrow
    \\
    sSet
    &\hookrightarrow&
    dSet
  }
  \,,
$$

where the left vertical function is the [[nerve]] $N :$ [[Cat]] $\to$ [[sSet]], and where the top horizontal functor includes categories into [[Set]]-enriched operads as those operads with only unary operations.

Moreover, $dSet$ completes this diagram even as a diagram of most of the evident pairs of [[adjoint functors]]. For details see _[The full diagram of relations](#FullDiagram)_ below.


## Definition ##

### Dendroidal sets

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Write [[Operad]] for the category of [[operads]], specifically for

* [[Set]]-enriched;

* [[symmetric operad|symmetric]];

* multi-colored

operads, also known as symmetric [[multicategories]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #FreeOperadCategory}
###### Definition

The symmetric [[tree category]] is the [[full subcategory]]

$$
  \Omega \hookrightarrow Operad
$$

of [[Operad]] on those [[symmetric operads]] that are [[free construction|free]] on the symmetric collections given by finite rooted trees. (...)

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **dendroidal set** is a [[presheaf]] on the [[tree category]] $\Omega$. 

The [[category]] of dendroidal sets is the [[functor category]]

$$
  dSet = [\Omega^{op}, Set]
  \,.
$$

=--

Some **terminology and notation**:

* For $T \in \Omega$ a tree, write $\Omega[T] := \Omega(-,T)$ for the dendroidal set that it [[representable functor|represents]].

* For $X$ a dendroidal set and $T$ a tree, the set $dSet(\Omega[T],X) \simeq X(T)$ (using the [[Yoneda lemma]]) is the set of $T$-shaped **dendrices** in $X$. One of its elements is called a $T$-shaped **dendrex**, analogous to a [[simplex]] in a [[simplicial set]].


### Faces of trees and dendroidal sets 

The _face maps_ on trees, regarded as dendroidal sets, are morphisms that generalize the face maps in the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$. Defining them in $\Omega$ requires a few case distinctions:

there are

1. inner face maps -- obtained by contracting an inner edge 

1. outer face maps -- obtained by 

   1. removing an outer input vertex

   1. removing a vertex whose output is the root and which has precisely one inner incoming edge (which becomes the new root)

   1. a corolla face -- any one of the inclusions of the tree with no vertex into a tree with precisely one vertex



#### Inner faces

For $T \in \Omega$ and $e$ an _inner edge_ (in the obvious sense), write $T/e$ for the tree obtained by contracting/discarding this inner edge. There is then a canonical inclusion

$$
  \partial_e : T/e \to T
  \,.
$$ 

This is called an **inner face map**.


For example let 

$$
  T = 
   \left(
    \array{
     \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     & v
     \\
     \searrow & & \searrow^e
     \\
      & \bullet &\to& \bullet &\to& 
     \\
     \nearrow
    }
  \right)
$$

then 

$$
  T/e = 
   \left(
    \array{
     \searrow && \searrow& & \swarrow 
     \\
      & \bullet &\to& \bullet &\to& 
     \\
     \nearrow
    }
  \right)
$$

and the inclusion $T/e \to T$ the the operad morphism that is the identity on the operation  $
  \array{
    \searrow
    \\
    & \bullet & \to
    \\
    \nearrow
  }
$
and which sends the trinary operation
$
  \array{
     \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     \to & \bullet & \to
  }
$
to the composite trinary operation
$
    \array{
     \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     & \bullet
     \\
      & & \searrow^e
     \\
      & &\to& \bullet &\to& 
     \\
    }
$


#### Outer face maps

In contrast to that, _outer_ edges are always removed together: 

if $v$ is a vertex of $T$ such that all but one edge incident on it are outer, then denote by $T/v$ the tree obtained by discarding $v$ and all the outer edges indicent on it. There is then again a canonical inclusion

$$
  \partial_v : T/v \to T
  \,.
$$

This is called an **outer face map**.

In the above example for $T$ we have

$$
  T/v 
   = 
   \left(
    \array{
     \searrow & & \searrow^e
     \\
      & \bullet &\to& \bullet &\to& 
     \\
     \nearrow
    }
  \right)
$$

#### Corolla faces

If the tree has precisely one vertex it is called a **corolla**. There are $n+1$ injections of the tree with no vertex $|$ into the corolla with $n$ inputs. All these are outer face maps.

$$
  | \hookrightarrow
  \array{
    \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    & {*}
    \\
    & \downarrow
  }
  \,.
$$

### Normal morphisms and normal dendroidal sets


+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma (face maps are the monomorphisms)

The inner and outer face morphisms $\partial_e$ and $\partial_v$ are precisely the [[monomorphism]]s in the [[tree category]] $\Omega$. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Lemma 3.1 in [MoeWei07](http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=20087314).

=--


The **boundary of a tree** is the union of all its face dendroidal sets

$$
  \partial \Omega[T] = \cup_{e \in Edges(T)} \Omega[\partial_e T] \cup_{v \in Vertices(T)} \Omega[\partial_v T] 
  \,.
$$

Compare to [[boundary of a simplex]].

Analogously then to the notion of [[horn]] of a [[simplex]], for $d$ an edge of $T$ the union

$$
  \Lambda^e \Omega[T] = \cup_{e \neq d \in Edges(T)} \Omega[\partial_e T] \cup_{v \in Vertices(T)} \Omega[\partial_v T] 
$$

of dendroidal sets is the **inner horn** of $T$ at $e$, and for $w$ an outer face the union

$$
  \Lambda^w \Omega[T] = \cup_{e \neq d \in Edges(T)} \Omega[\partial_e T] \cup_{v \neq w \in Vertices(T)} \Omega[\partial_v T] 
$$

is the **outer horn** at $w$.

We have the canonical **boundary inclusions**

$$
  \partial \Omega[T] \to \Omega[T]
$$

and **horn inclusions**

$$
  \Lambda^\alpha \Omega[T] \to \Omega[T]
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[monomorphism]] $X \to Y$ of dendroidal sets is called **normal** if for any tree $T$, any non-degenerate dendrex $y \in Y(T)$ which does not belong to the image of $X(T)$ has a trivial stabilizer $Aut(T)_y \subset Aut(T)$. 

A dendroidal set $X$ is **normal** if $\emptyset \hookrightarrow X$ is a normal monomorphism. 

=--

For instance for any tree $T$, the dendroidal set $\Omega[T]$ is normal.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark 

This has nothing to do with the notion of [[normal monomorphism]] in a context with [[zero morphisms]].  

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The class of morphisms in $dSet$ generated from the boundary inclusions under [[pushout]] and [[transfinite composition]] is precisely the class of **normal monomorphisms**.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is prop 1.4 in [CisMoer09](http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1954).

### Boardman-Vogt tensor product
 {#BoardmanVogtTensorProduct}

As any [[category of presheaves]], $dSet$ is a [[cartesian monoidal category]]. However, the cartesian [[tensor product]] is not the natural one with respect to the inclusion of [[operads]] into dendroidal sets. The natural monoidal structure on [[Operad]] is rather a generalization of the [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]].

+-- {: .num_defn #BVTensorProduct}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  N_d(-\otimes -)
  :
  \Omega \times \Omega
  \hookrightarrow
  Operad \times Operad
  \hookrightarrow
  Operad
  \stackrel{N_d}{\to}
  dSet
$$

for the functor that forms the [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]] of the free operads given by two trees, and then regards the result as a dendroidal set by the dendroidal nerve, def. \ref{DendroidalNerve}.

The **tensor product of dendroidal sets** is the [[Yoneda extension]] 

$$
  -\otimes - : dSet \times dSet \to dSet
$$

of this functor, hence the unique such functor which preserves [[colimits]] in both variables and coincides with the BV-tensor product of operads on $\Omega$.

=--

With respect to this tensor product is $dSet$ a [[closed monoidal category]]. This is discussed [below](#ClosedMonoidalStructure).


## Properties

### Relation to simplicial sets 
  {#RelationToSimplicialSets}

Write $0$ for the tree consisting of a single edge. Let $\Omega/0$ be the [[over category]]. By inspection one sees that

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There is an [[equivalence of categories]] 

$$
  \Omega/0 \simeq \Delta
$$

of the slice with the [[simplex category]].


Moreover, the over-category of all dendroidal sets over $\eta := \Omega[0]$ is the category [[sSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s

$$
  dSet/\Omega[0] \simeq sSet
  \,.
$$

=--

By general properties of [[Kan extension]] we have the following

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The corresponding canonical [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  i : \Delta \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Omega/0 \to \Omega
$$

is 

1. a [[full and faithful functor]];

1. a [[sieve]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition


The functor $i : \Delta \to \Omega$ induces an [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*) 
   : 
   sSet
  \stackrel{
    \overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}
  }{
    \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\hookrightarrow}}
  }
  dSet
  \,,
$$

where

* $i^*$ is given by precomposition with $i$;

* $i_*$ is a [[full and faithful functor]] defined equivalently as

  * the [[left adjoint]] to $i^*$;

  * the left [[Kan extension]] of $i$;

  * the canonical functor $sSet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} dSet/\Omega[0] \to dSet$;

  * the functor that sends  $X \in sSet$ to 

    $$
      i_!(X) 
       : 
     T 
     \mapsto 
      \left\{
        \array{
          X_n & if\,T\,is\,linear\,with\,n\,vertices;
          \\
          \emptyset & otherwise
        }
      \right.
      \,.
    $$

Hence $i_!$ is a [[full and faithful functor]], and hence (see the discussion at [[adjoint triple]]) so is $i_*$.

Accordingly, $i : sSet \hookrightarrow dSet$ is an [[open geometric morphism|open]] [[geometric embedding]] of [[presheaf toposes]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


The dendroidal set $i_!([n])$ that corresponds to the $n$-[[simplex]] is to be visualized as the linear tree with $(n+1)$-edges:

$$
  i([n])
  =
  \left(
  \stackrel{0}{\to} 
    \bullet
  \stackrel{1}{\to}
    \bullet
  \stackrel{2}{\to}
  \cdots 
  \bullet
  \stackrel{n}{\to} 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

We think of each bullet as a unary operation -- an ordinary [[morphism]] -- $\stackrel{n}{\to}\bullet \stackrel{n+1}{\to}$ from the [[object]] $n$ to the object $(n+1)$. 


Notice that this is hence Poincar&eacute;-dual to how one tends to visualize $[n]$ itself

$$
  [n] = (0 \to 1 \to 2 \to \cdots \to n)  
$$

and how one tends to visualize morphisms $n \to (n+1)$.

=--

### Relation to $Set$-operads -- dendroidal nerve
 {#RelationToOperads}

By the general notion of [[nerve and realization]], the 
inclusion $\Omega \hookrightarrow Operad$ from def. \ref{FreeOperadCategory}
induces a [[nerve]] operation on [[operads]] with values in 
[[simplicial sets]].

+-- {: .num_defn #DendroidalNerve}
###### Definition

For $O \in Operad$ an [[operad]], its **[[dendroidal nerve]]**
is the dendroidal set given by

$$
  N_d(O) : T \mapsto Hom_{Operad}(T, O)
  \,.
$$

This extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  N_d : Operad \to dSet
  \,.
$$

=--

By general properties of [[nerve and realization]] we have:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The dendroidal nerve has the following properties.

* It extends the simplicial nerve of operads in that

  $$
    i^* \circ N_d = N
    \,.
  $$

* It has a [[left adjoint]]

  $$
    \tau_d : dSet \to Operad
  $$

  given by [[left Kan extension]].

=--

For $X$ a dendroidal set, $\tau_d(X)$ is also called the **operad generated by** $X$.

$$
  Operad
    \stackrel{\overset{\tau_d}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N_d}{\to}}
  dSet
$$

### Relation to $sSet$-operads -- homotopy coherent dendroidal nerve
 {#HomotopyCoherentNerve}


The dendroidal nerve of [[Set]]-[[operads]] discussed 
[above](#RelationToOperads) is important for setting up the model of
dendroidal sets. But the usefulness of the model comes from 
its relation to [[sSet]]/[[Top]]-enriched operads ([[topological operads]])
via an operadic generalization of the [[homotopy coherent nerve]] that sends [[sSet-enriched categories]] to [[simplicial sets]].

Write $Operad_sSet$ for the category of [[sSet]]-enriched operads ([[simplicial operads]]). Write

$$ 
  W_H : Operad_sSet \to Operad_sSet
$$

for the [[Boardman-Vogt resolution]] functor.

The restriction of this along the inclusion of free Set-operads

$$
  \Omega \hookrightarrow Operad
  \hookrightarrow
  Operad_{sSet}
  \stackrel{W_H}{\to}
  Operad_{sSet}
  \,,
$$

which will also be denoted just $W_H$ in the following, 
canonically induces [[nerve and realization]] functors:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The **homotopy coherent nerve** of a simplicial operad $P$ is the dendroidal set $hcN_d(P)$ given by

$$
  hcN_d(P) : T \mapsto Hom_{Operad_{sSet}}(W_H(T), P)
 \,.
$$

This extends to a [[functor]]

$$  
  hcN_d : Operad_{sSet} \to dSet
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition


We write

$$
  {\vert -\vert}_H : dSet \to Operad_{sSet}
$$

for the corresponding [[left adjoint]] [[nerve and realization|realization]].

=--

Via this [[adjunction]]

$$
  ({\vert -\vert}_H \dashv hcN_d)
  : 
  Operad_{sSet}
  \to dSet
$$

we may understand generally the theory of dendroidal sets as being about BV-resolutions of simplicial operads.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $P \in Operad_{sSet}$. 

There is an [[isomorphism]] of simplicial operads

$$
  W_H(P) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  {\vert hcN_d P \vert}_H
$$

between the [[Boardman-Vogt resolution]] $W_H(P)$ of $P$ and the homotopy-realization of its homotopy-coherent dendroidal nerve.

=--

All of this is an operadic generalization of the _[[relation between quasi-categories and simplicial categories]]_.

### The full diagram of relations
 {#FullDiagram}

The above functors between dendroidal sets and 
simplicial sets ([here](#RelationToSimplicialSets))
and operads ([here](#RelationToOperads)) 
arrange into the following [[diagram]]



$$
  \array{
     sSet 
     &\stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\underset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}&
     dSet
     \\
     {}^\mathllap{\tau} \downarrow
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{N}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\tau_d}}
     \downarrow
     \uparrow^{N_d}
     \\
     Cat
     &
     \stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\to}}{\underset{j^*}{\leftarrow}}
     &
     Operad
  }
  \,,
$$

where functors on the left and on top are [[left adjoint|left adjoints]] to those on the right and on the bottom, respectively.

This commutes in three of four possible ways, up to [[natural isomorphism]] 
in that

1. $j_! \tau \simeq \tau_d i_!$;

1. $N j^* \simeq i^* N_d$;

1. $i_! N \simeq N_d j_!$.

There is also a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  \tau i^* \Rightarrow j^* \tau_d
  \,,
$$

but not all of its components are isomorphisms.

Moreover, $N, N_d$,$i_!, j_!$ are [[full and faithful functors]] 
and hence (see the properties of [[adjoint functors]])

1. $\tau N \simeq id$;

1. $\tau_d N_d \simeq id$;

1. $i^* i_! \simeq id$;

1. $j^* j_! \simeq id$.


## Structure on $dSet$ ##


### Closed symmetric monoidal structure
 {#ClosedMonoidalStructure}

The category $dSet$ of dendroidal sets carries the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal category]], defined as follows:

in analogy to the [[nerve]] [[adjunction]]

$$
  \tau : SSet \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Cat : N
$$

between ordinary [[category|categories]] and [[simplicial set]]s, there is an adjunction

$$
  \tau_d : dSet \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} Operad : N_d
$$

between [[operad]]s and dendroidal sets. 

The category [[Operad]] carries the [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]] $\otimes_{BV}$ and the symmetric monoidal structure on $dSet$ is taken to be the unique one 

* that makes $\tau_d$ a [[symmetric monoidal functor]];

* such that for any two trees $T,S$ we have

  $$
    \Omega[T] \otimes \Omega[S] = N_d(T \otimes_{BV} S)
    \,.
  $$

With respect to this monoidal struucture $dSet$ is a [[closed monoidal category]]. 

### $SSet$-enriched structure ###

Using the fact that $dSet$ is a [[closed monoidal category]] with [[internal hom]] dendroidal sets $[C,D]$ for dendroidal sets $C$ and $D$, and using the functor $i^* : dSet \to SSet$ we obtain canonically the structure of an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] on $dSet$ with the hom-simplicial set between $C$ and $D$ being $i^*[C,D]$.


### Model category structure

The category $dSet$ carries the Cisinski-Moerdijk [[model structure on dendroidal sets]]. With this model structure it forms a [[monoidal model category]]. 

Together with the fact that $i^*: dSet \to sSet$ is a [[right Quillen functor]] (with respect to the [[model structure for quasi-categories]]) this imples that $dSet$ is an $sSet_{Joyal}$-[[enriched model category]] (but not, without further work, an $sSet_{Quillen}$-enriched model category!).
