## Definition
 {#Definition}

A [[pointed topological space]] $(X,x)$ is called *well-pointed* if the base-point inclusion $\{x\} \xhookrightarrow{\;} X$ is a closed [[Hurewicz cofibration]] (e.g. [tom Dieck 2008, p. 102](#tomDieck2008)). If the topological space is [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]], then closedness is implied (by [this Prop.](Hurewicz+cofibration#HurewiczCofibrationsInCGWHSpacesAreClosed)) and one may require just a Hurewicz cofibration (eg. [Bredon 1993, VII, Def. 1.8](#Bredon93)).

A [[topological group]] is called well-pointed if it is so at its [[neutral element]], hence if $\{\mathrm{e}\} \xhookrightarrow{\;} G$ is a closed [[Hurewicz cofibration]].

A [[simplicial topological group]] is well-pointed if all its component groups are.

A key property of well-pointed topological groups (in the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient]] context of [[compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces]]) is that the [[nerves]] of their [[delooping groupoids]] are [[good simplicial topological spaces]] (by [this Ex.](Hurewicz+cofibration#KifiedProductsOfCofibrationsWithCompactlyGeneratedSpaces)). Similarly, the underlying simplicial topological spaces of well-pointed simplicial topological groups are [[good simplicial topological space|good]] ([this Prop.](simplicial+topological+group#RealizationOfWellPointedIsWellPointed)). These facts explain the key role of well-pointedness in [[classifying space]]-theory, where it ensures that plain [[topological realization of simplicial topological spaces]] coincides, up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]], with [[fat geometric realization]] and hence with the [[homotopy colimits]].

## Examples


\begin{example}\label{ParacompactBanachManifoldsAreWellPointed}
  Every [[locally Euclidean topological space|locally Euclidean]] [[Hausdorff space]] is well-pointed, in particular every [[topological manifold]] is well pointed. In fact, every [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]] [[Banach manifold]] is well-pointed.
\end{example}
(Immediate by the discussion of [examples of Hurewicz cofibrations](Hurewicz+cofibration#Examples)).

\begin{example}\label{PointInclusionIntoPUH}
**(the [[projective unitary group]] [[PU(ℋ)]])**
\linebreak
  The [[projective unitary group]] [[PU(ℋ)]] on an infinite-dimensional [[separable Hilbert space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] is:

* a [[Banach Lie group]] in its [[norm topology]], and as such [[well-pointed topological group|well-pointed]] by Ex.\ref{ParacompactBanachManifoldsAreWellPointed};

* no longer a Banach space in its weak/strong [[operator topology]], but nevertheless still [[well-pointed topological group|well-pointed]] in this case, by [this Prop.](projective+unitary+group+on+a+Hilbert+space#WellPointedInOperatorTopology).

\end{example}
