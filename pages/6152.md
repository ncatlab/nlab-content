## Idea

If one has the  category of covering spaces of a (nice enough) topological space, then picking a point in the base the operation of taking the fibre over that point gives a functor to the category of sets. The natural automorphisms of this functor form the (algebraic) [[Chevalley fundamental group|fundamental group]], $\pi_1$, of the base, and the main theorem of the Galois-Poincaré theory of covering spaces can be viewed as stating that this sets up an equivalence of categories between that category of covering spaces and the category of $\pi_1$-sets. This equivalence is compatible with the chosen fibre functor and the forgetful functor from $\pi_1-Sets$ to $Sets$. Extracting from this situation, that forgetful functor is thought of as being a _fibre functor_ as well.  Any category of $G$-sets, for $G$ a group, gives a monoidal category, and the forgetful functor is a monoidal functor; of course, the category of $G$-sets corresponds to the category of permutation representations of $G$, and generalising this basic example leads to the following idea.

The [[forgetful functor|forgetful]] [[strict monoidal functor]] from a [[monoidal category]] to some standard monoidal category, usually the category [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]] over a field is called the __fiber functor__ in some contexts, especially in [[Tannaka reconstruction]] in which the symmetry object is reconstructed from the (object of) endomorphisms of the fiber functor. In mixed Tannaka duality, a single fiber functor does not suffice for reconstruction, but rather a family of fiber functors to different bases. 




Historically, the notion was used extensively, starting in the 1960s by Grothendieck and his collaborators. The terminology is from the [[Grothendieck Galois theory]]: namely Grothendieck reconstructs the (profinite) fundamental group in algebraic geometry from a fiber functor: the fundamental group acts on a covering by deck transformations and by monodromy transformation for bundles over the covering, algebraic analogues of such a picture can thus be used to define a fundamental group, not by using some idea of loops which are often hard to define in abstract setups, but by a form of Tannakian reconstruction. Grothendieck also introduced the idea of using many `base points' that is, many fibre functors, thus giving an abstract analogue of the  [[fundamental groupoid]] of a space.

## Warning

Please do not confuse the terminology with the case of a functor which is a [[Grothendieck fibration]] (i.e. a fibered category); nor with a fiber ("preimage" of a sort) of a functor. These are related ideas but are best kept separate.
