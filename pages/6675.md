## Idea

In _topological quantum computation_ one aims to make use of [[quantum systems]] described by [[topological quantum field theory]] for [[quantum computation]], the idea being that the defining invariance of [[TQFTs]] under small deformations implements a robust form of [[quantum error correction]].

One approach to potentially realizing topological quantum computation in practice is via [[anyons]] in the [[quantum Hall effect]] and effectively described by some kind of [[Chern-Simons theory]].

For the time being see at _[[quantum computation]]_ for more.
