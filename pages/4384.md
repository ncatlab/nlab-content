[[Todd Trimble]]: Stephen, you need to slow down with the entries. You are inadvertently introducing clashes of terminology which are not helpful, and which are possibly harmful to the coherence of the Lab. For instance, [[quasicategory]]. 

May I ask that you please make a note of all additions or changes to the Lab at the nForum.
