## Definition

A _matrix Lie algebra_ is the [[Lie algebra]] that is canonically a sub-Lie algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ of $n \times n$-[[matrices]] $Mat(n)$.

See also [[matrix Lie group]]


## Properties

By **Ado's theorem** , every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristics zero is a matrix Lie algebra. A similar statement fails for Lie groups. Ado's theorem has been used as a major step in the traditional proofs of the [[Lie's three theorems|Cartan-Lie theorem]] on the existence of [[Lie integration|integration of Lie algebras]] to Lie groups.
