## Idea

In a [[model (in theoretical physics)]] of [[gravity]] coupled to other fields, the _energy momentum tensor_ or _stress energy tensor_ T is the [[variational calculus|variation]] of the matter part $S_{fields}$ in the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] with respect to the metric, $\delta S_{fields} = T \delta g$.

It is a measure for the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] density of the matter contribution to the theory. 

Since the variation of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] $S_{EH}$ is the [[Einstein tensor]] $G$, the [[equations of motion]] of [[gravity]], hence [[Einstein's equations]] assert that (up to constant prefactors)

$$
  G = T
  \,.
$$
