
__Albert Lautman__ was a French [[philosophy of mathematics|mathematical philosopher]].

He was interested in the structure of advanced mathematics and its creativity and critiziced the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] like [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] from the early 20th century who dealt mainly with the issues of a particular logical [[foundation]] and formal aspects and not much on the nature of doing mathematics and its meaning. 

As a member of the Resistance, a former prisoner of war and also of Jewish origin, he was killed by a German squad on August 1, 1944.

He influenced the French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Alain Badiou]], the mathematician and historian of culture and mathematical philosophy [[Fernando Zalamea]], and the philosopher [[David Corfield]].

### Lautman on effective and advanced mathematics

According to 

* Fernando Zalamea, _Albert Lautman and the Creative
Dialectic of Modern Mathematics_

> With the term ‘effective mathematics’, Lautman tackles the theories, structures and constructions conceived in the very activity of the mathematician. The term refers to the structure of mathematical knowledge, and what is effective refers to the concrete _action_ of the mathematician to gradually build the mathematical edifice, that such action is constructivist or existential. The mathematical – beyond its ideal set theoretical reconstruction – develops along a hierarchy of real configurations of rather diverse complexity, in which the concepts and examples are connected through structural processes of liberation and saturation, resulting in mathematical creations like mixes between opposite polarities. Lautman detects some _specific_ features of advanced mathematics that are not given in elementary mathematics: 

> a) the _complex hierarchisation_ of various theories, irreducible to systems of _intermediate_ deduction; 

> b) the _richness_ of the models, irreducible to linguistic manipulation; 

> c) the _unity_ of structural methods and of conceptual polarites, beyond the effective multiplicity of models; 

> d) the _dynamics_ of the creative activity, in a permanent back-and-forth between freedom and saturation, open to the Platonic division and the Platonic dialectic; 

> e) the _mathematically demonstrable relation_ between what is multiple on a given level and what is singular on another, through a sophisticated lattice of mixed ascents and descents.
