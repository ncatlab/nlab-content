## Idea

Computer science studies [[programs]] and languages to express them. From the [[nPOV]], it studies, amongst lots of other things,  the operation, application and design of computers. This includes aspects relating to [[models for concurrency|concurrency]], [[semantics]] of programming languages, and aspects of [[mathematical logic]]. 

Together with its [[type theory]] and [[category theory]], computer science is part of the [[computational trinitarianism]].
