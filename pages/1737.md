## Idea

Computer science studies [[programs]] and languages to express them, as well as the operation, application and design of computers. This includes aspects relating to [[models for concurrency|concurrency]], [[semantics]] of [[programming languages]], and aspects of [[mathematical logic]]. 

From the [[nPOV]], computer science is part of the [[computational trinity]], together with [[type theory]] and [[category theory]].  Maybe _programming theory_ would have been a good term for computer science (to match with its siblings). But it's not used this way, more's the pity.
