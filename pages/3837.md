
In some choices of [[foundations]], one says __small set__ in order to amplify that one really means a [[set]] and not a [[proper class]].  Strictly speaking, in this case one could just say "set".

However, in other choices of [[foundations]], such as [[Grothendieck universes]], there exist both "small sets" (sets that belong to the universe) and "large sets" (sets that do not, such as the universe itself).  In this case the adjective really is necessary.  We also gain an intermediate notion of __moderate set__: a subset of the universe, which may be small or large.  (Every small set is moderate, but not conversely; again, the universe itself is the standard counterexample.)

Since in many cases the choice of foundations is irrelevant, it makes sense to always say "small set" for emphasis even if one has in mind a foundation where all sets are small.

Similarly, a __small family__ is a [[family]] indexed by a small set; the [[axiom of replacement]] (if it applies in the foundation in question) then says that the [[image]] of the family is also small.

We also have related notions of small [[ordinals]], [[small categories]], etc.
