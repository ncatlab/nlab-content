There are several different (sometimes related) mathematical objects called ''spectrum'' or whose name has ''spectral'' as prefix:

* [[spectrum]] in [[stable homotopy theory]].

* [[spectrum (geometry)]] in [[geometry]]

* inlcuding [[spectral theory]] such _[[spectrum of an operator]]_, spectra of families, of a Banach algebra, _[[Gelfand spectrum]]_, prime (primitive etc.) spectrum of a commutative or noncommutative ring, _[[analytic spectrum]]_, _[[spectrum of an abelian category]]_, _[[Orlov spectrum]]_ of a triangulated category etc.

There is also a notion of 

* [[spectral sequence]]

which has no particular relation to other notions of _spectrum_ .
