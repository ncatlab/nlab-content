There are several different (sometimes related) mathematical objects called ''spectrum'' or whose name has ''spectral'' as prefix:

* [[spectrum]] in [[stable homotopy theory]].

* [[spectrum (geometry)]] in [[geometry]], [[Cole's theory of spectrum]]

* including [[spectral theory]] such _[[spectrum of an operator]]_, spectra of families, of a Banach algebra, _[[Gelfand spectrum]]_, prime (primitive etc.) [[spectrum of a commutative ring]], [[spectrum of a ring]], _[[analytic spectrum]]_, [[Cole's theory of spectrum]], _[[spectrum of an abelian category]]_, _[[Orlov spectrum]]_,  _[[spectrum of a triangulated category]]_, _[[prime spectrum of a symmetric monoidal stable (∞,1)-category]]_, etc.

There is also a notion of 

* [[spectral sequence]]

which has no particular relation to other notions of _spectrum_, except that [[filtered spectra]] give rise to [[spectral sequences of filtered spectra]].


In [[physics]]:

* [[atomic spectrum]]
