## Idea

A _complex Lie group_ is a [[Lie group]] that is a [[group object]] not just [[internalization|internal]] to [[smooth manifolds]] but in fact to [[complex manifolds]]. Hence it is a [[complex manifold]] $G$ equipped with a [[group]] structure such that both the multiplication map $G \times G \to G$ as well as the [[inverse]] map $G \to G$ are [[holomorphic functions]].

## Properties

### Relation to almost complex structure

One can also conider groups in [[almost complex manifolds]]. But every _almost complex Lie group_ is automatically also a complex Lie group.

### Complexification of compact Lie groups

For $K$ a [[compact Lie group]] there is a unique [[connected topological space|connected]] complex Lie group $G$ such that 

1. the [[Lie algebra]] of $G$ is the [[complexification]] of the Lie algebra of $K$: 

   $$
     Lie(G) \simeq Lie(K) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}
     \,,
   $$

1. $K$ is a [[maximal compact subgroup]] of $G$.

This $G$ is called the **complexification** of $K$.
