## Idea

In [[representation theory]], one defines the _character of a [[linear representation]] $\rho\colon G\to End(V)$ to be the [[group character]] on $G$ given by $g \mapsto Tr \rho(g)$, whenever the [[trace]] in $V$ makes sense (e.g. when $V$ is [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]]).  Since such a function is invariant under conjugation, we may equivalently consider it a function on the set of [[conjugacy classes]] of elements in $G$.

Sometimes we also extend a character linearly to the free vector space on the set of conjugacy classes.  This version of the character can be identified with the [[bicategorical trace]] of the identity map of the representation, considered as a $k[G]$-$k$-module.

There is a different notion of an _infinitesimal character_ in [[Harishâ€“Chandra theory]] and also a notion of the _formal character_.

There are important formulas concerning characters in representation theory, like [[Weyl character formula]], Kirillov character formula, Demazure character formula and so on.  There is also a formula for the [[induced character]] of an [[induced representation]].

+-- {: .num_prop #InCharZeroCharacterMorphismIsInjective}
###### Proposition
**(in [[characteristic zero]] the [[character homomorphism]] is [[injective function|injective]])**

For $G$ a [[finite group]] and $k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]], the [[character homomorphism]]

$$
  \array{
    Rep_k(G)_{/\sim}
    &\overset{\chi}{\longrightarrow}&
    k^{ConjCl(G)}
    \\
    V 
      &\mapsto&
    \big(
      [g] \mapsto \chi_V(g) 
    \mathrlap{
      \coloneqq \mathrm{tr}_V(g)
    \big)
    }
  }
$$

is [[injective function|injective]].

+-- {: .num_prop #NormalizedSumOfCharacters}
###### Proposition
**(normalized [[sum]] of [[character of a linear representation|characters]] is [[fixed point space]]-[[dimension]])**

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]] of [[order of a group|order]] ${\vert G \vert} \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $V \in Rep_k(G)$ be a [[linear representation]] over a [[ground field]] $k$ of [[characteristic zero]]. Then the [[dimension]] of the [[fixed point space]] $V^G$ of $V$ under $G$ equals the normalized [[sum]] of the characters over all group elements:

$$
  dim\left( V^G \right)
  \;=\;
  \frac{1}{{\vert G\vert}}
  \underset{g \in G}{\sum}
  \chi_V(g)
  \,.
$$
