* [[Tim Porter]], _The Crossed Menagerie: 
an introduction to crossed gadgetry and cohomology in algebra and 
topology_. 
(Notes, in part, prepared for the  _XVI Encuentro Rioplatense de 
Algebra y Geometría Algebraica_, in Buenos Aires, 12-15 December 
2006, and for course MATH5312, Spring-Summer term 2007, 
University of Ottawa) ([[menagerie10a.pdf|pdf:file]])

This is an ongoing set of notes outlining an approach to [[nonabelian cohomology]], [[stack]]s, etc., and Grothendieck's conjectured extension of 'Galois-Poincaré theory'. The title refers to the array of strange beasties that occur as generalisations of [[crossed modules]]. (The present version is over 719 pages long, and is changing regularly. A fairly stable version (but up-dates are planned shortly!) is available as a download,  [[menagerie10a.pdf|here:file]].

These notes, or at least the first few chapters of them, acted as course notes for a 4 lecture course in Buenos Aires, and later on for a course on cohomology in Ottawa. 

  Some idea of the content can be gleaned from the Table of Contents.
