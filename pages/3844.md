## Idea

In as far as an [[algebraic theory]] or [[Lawvere theory]] is nothing but a [[small category]] with finite [[product]]s and an [[algebra]] for the theory a product-preserving [[functor]] to [[Set]], the notion has an evident generalization to [[higher category theory]] and in particular to [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An **$(\infty,1)$-Lawvere theory** is (given by a syntactic $(\infty,1)$-category that is) an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ with finite [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-product]]s. An $(\infty,1)$-algebra for the theory is an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $C \to $ [[∞Grpd]] that preserves these products.

The $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-algebras is the full [[sub-quasi-category|(∞,1)-subcategory]]

$$
  Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
$$

of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on $C^{op}$ on the product-preserving $(\infty,1)$-functors

=--

In a full $(\infty,1)$-category theoretic context this appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 5.5.8.8]]. A definition in terms of [[simplicially enriched categories]] and the [[model structure on sSet-categories]] to present $(\infty,1)$-categories is in [Ros]((http://www.math.muni.cz/~rosicky/papers/infty6.pdf). The introduction of that article lists further and older occurences of this definition.

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with finite [[limit in a quasi-category|product]]s. Then 

* $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is an [[accessible (∞,1)-functor|accessible]] [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ (on the [[opposite (∞,1)-category|opposite]]).

  So in particular it is a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]].

* $Alg_{(\inft)}$ is a [[compactly generated (∞,1)-category]].

* The $(\infty,1)$-[[Yoneda embedding]] $j : C^{op} \to PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ factors through $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$.

* The full subcategory $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is stable under [[sifted colimit]]s.


=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 5.5.8.10]].

## Models {#Models}

There are various [[model category]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentations]] of $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$.

Recalll that the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ itself is modeled by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
  \simeq
  [C, sSet]^\circ
  \,,
$$

where we regard $C$ as a [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category]] and have on the right the [[sSet]]-[[enriched functor category]] with the projective or injective model structure, and $(-)^\circ$ denoting the full enriched subcategory on fibrant-cofibrant objects.

This says in particular that every weak $(\infty,1)$-functor $f : C \to \infty \mathrm{Grp}$ is equivalent to a _rectified_ on $F : C \to KanCplx$. And $f \in PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ belongs to $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ if $F$ preserves finite products _weakly_  in that for $\{c_i \in C\}$ a finite collection of objects, the canonical natural morphism

$$
  F(c_1 \times \cdots, \c_n)
  \to
  F(c_1) \times \cdots \times F(c_n)
$$ 

is a [[homotopy equivalence]] of [[Kan complex]]es.

We now look at model category structure on _strictly_ product preserving functors $C \to sSet$, which gives an equivalent model for $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$.

###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a category with finite [[product]], and let $sAlg(C) \subset Func(C,sSet)$ be the [[full subcategory]] on the [[functor category]] from $C$ to [[sSet]] that preserve these products.  

Then $sAlg(C)$ carries the structure of a [[model category]] $sAlg(C)_{proj}$ where the weak equivalences and the fibrations are objectwise those in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

This is due to 

* [[Dan Quillen]], _Homotopical Algebra_ Lectures Notes in Mathematics 43, SpringerVerlag, Berlin, (1967)

The inclusion $i : sAlg(C) \hookrightarrow sPSh(C^{op})_{proj}$ into the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] evidently preserves fiibrations and acylclic fibrations and gives a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  sAlg(C)_{proj}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  sPSh(C^{op})
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The total right [[derived functor]] 

$$
  \mathbb{R}i : Ho(sAlg(C)_{proj}) \to Ho(sPSh(C^{op})_{proj})
$$ 

is a [[full and faithful functor]] and an object $F \in sPSh(C^{op})$ belongs to the [[essential image]] of $\mathbb{R}i$ precisely if it preserves product up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--

This is due to

* [[Julie Bergner]], _Rigidification of algebras over multi-sorted theories_ , Algebraic and Geometric Topoogy 7, 2007.

It follows that the natural $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  (sAlg(C)_{proj})^\circ \stackrel{}{\to}
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
$$

is an [[equivalence of quasi-categories|equivalence]].

A comprehensive statement of these facts is in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, section 5.5.9]].

## Examples

### Smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras

The [[Lawvere theory]] whose syntactic category with finite products is [[CartSp]] has as algebra [[smooth algebra]]s. The same theory, regarded as an $(\infty,1)$-algebraic theory, has as algebras **smooth $(\infty,1)$-algebras. 

These  were considered for the discussion of [[derived smooth manifold]]s in

* [[David Spivak]], _Derived smooth manifolds_ ([arXiv:0810.5174](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5174))
