## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **regular** if it is both [[transitive action|transitive]] and [[free action|free]], that is, if for any pair of elements $x,y \in X$, there is _exactly one_ group element $g \in G$ such that $g x = y$.

###### Proposition
Suppose $G$ acts transitively on $X$ by $* : G \times X \to X$, and suppose moreover that this action is [[faithful action|faithful]].  Then $G$ acts freely (and hence regularly) on $X$ if and only if the group $Aut_G(X)$ of $G$-equivariant automorphisms (i.e., [[bijections]] $\phi : X \to X$ commuting with the action of $G$) acts transitively (and hence regularly) on $X$.

###### Proof 

First we show that $Aut_G(X)$ acts freely on $X$. Suppose $\phi \in Aut_G(X)$ is such that $\phi(x) = x$ for some $x\in X$, and let $y\in X$ be arbitrary.  By the assumption that $G$ acts transitively, there is a $g \in G$ such that $y = g*x$. But then $G$-equivariance implies that
$$\phi(y) = \phi(g*x) = g*\phi(x) = g*x = y.$$
Since this holds for all $y\in Y$, $\phi$ must be equal to the identity $\phi = id_X$, and therefore $Aut_G(X)$ acts freely on $X$.

Next, suppose that $G$ also acts freely on $X$, and let $x,y \in X$ be arbitrary.  Then we can define a $G$-equivariant automorphism $\phi$ such that $\phi(x) = y$ by
$$\phi = z \mapsto g_z*y,$$
where for each $z$, $g_z$ is the unique group element such that $z = g_z*x$.  Conversely, suppose that $Aut_G(X)$ acts transitively on $X$, and let $x\in X$, $g\in G$ such that $g*x = x$.  By the assumption, for any $y \in X$, there exists $\phi \in Aut_G(X)$ such that $\phi(x) = y$, from which it follows that
$$g*y = g*\phi(x) = \phi(g*x) = \phi(x) = y.$$
Since $g*y = y$ for all $y \in X$, therefore $g = 1$ by the assumption that $G$ acts faithfully on $X$.

## Examples

* The action of $G$ on itself by multiplication $\cdot : G \times G \to G$ (on the left or on the right) is a regular action, called the (left or right) [[regular representation]] of $G$.

* If one views a [[combinatorial map]] $M$ as the transitive action of a certain group of permutations, then $M$ represents a _regular map_ ([Siran 2006](#SiranSurvey)) just in case this action is regular.  For example, the five [[Platonic solids]] may be represented as regular combinatorial maps.
