## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **regular** if it is both [[transitive action|transitive]] and [[free action|free]], that is, if for any pair of elements $x,y \in X$, there is _exactly one_ group element $g \in G$ such that $g x = y$.

###### Proposition
Suppose $G$ acts transitively on $X$ by $* : G \times X \to X$, and suppose moreover that this action is [[faithful action|faithful]].  Then $G$ acts freely (and hence regularly) on $X$ if and only if the group $Aut_G(X)$ of $G$-equivariant automorphisms (i.e., [[bijections]] $\phi : X \to X$ commuting with the action of $G$) acts transitively (and hence regularly) on $X$.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

First we show that $Aut_G(X)$ acts freely on $X$. Suppose $\phi \in Aut_G(X)$ is such that $\phi(x) = x$ for some $x\in X$, and let $y\in X$ be arbitrary.  By the assumption that $G$ acts transitively, there is a $g \in G$ such that $y = g*x$. But then $G$-equivariance implies that
$$\phi(y) = \phi(g*x) = g*\phi(x) = g*x = y.$$
Since this holds for all $y\in Y$, $\phi$ must be equal to the identity $\phi = id_X$, and therefore $Aut_G(X)$ acts freely on $X$.

Next, suppose that $G$ also acts freely on $X$, and let $x,y \in X$ be arbitrary.  Then we can define a $G$-equivariant automorphism $\phi$ such that $\phi(x) = y$ by
$$\phi = z \mapsto g_z*y,$$
where for each $z$, $g_z$ is the unique group element such that $z = g_z*x$.  Conversely, suppose that $Aut_G(X)$ acts transitively on $X$, and let $x\in X$, $g\in G$ such that $g*x = x$.  By the assumption, for any $y \in X$, there exists $\phi \in Aut_G(X)$ such that $\phi(x) = y$, from which it follows that
$$g*y = g*\phi(x) = \phi(g*x) = \phi(x) = y.$$
Since $g*y = y$ for all $y \in X$, therefore $g = 1$ by the assumption that $G$ acts faithfully on $X$.

## Examples

* The action of $G$ on itself by multiplication $\cdot : G \times G \to G$ (on the left or on the right) is a regular action, called the (left or right) [[regular representation]] of $G$.

* If one views a [[combinatorial map]] $M$ as the transitive action of a certain group of permutations, then $M$ represents a _regular map_ ([Siran 2006](#SiranSurvey)) just in case this action is regular.  For example, the five [[Platonic solids]] may be represented as regular combinatorial maps.

##In homotopy type theory

Since doing group [representation theory](representation+theory#in_homotopy_type_theory) corresponds to working in the context of a [[delooped group]] in [[homotopy type theory]], the regularity of an action is naturally expressed there. Transitivity ensures that all the points in the homotopy quotient are connected by equivalences, while freeness means that the space of equivalences between two points is itself contractible. Hence if $\ast: \mathbf{B} G \vdash X(\ast): Type$ corresponds to a regular action, then the quotient $\sum_{\ast: \mathbf{B} G} X(\ast)$ is contractible.

Restriction to 1-groups is unnecessary here, and we may speak of a regular [[infinity-action]] by an [[infinity-group]] as one with contractible homotopy quotient.

For any $G$-action $X : BG \to U$, we define
$$
BAut_G(X) := \sum_{(P:BG \to U)} \|P=X\|
$$
and 
$$\tilde{X} : BAut_G(X) \to U$$ 
by $\tilde{X}(P,-) := P(\ast)$.

###### Proposition
If $X$ is regular, then $\tilde{X}$ is regular.
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof
First, we need to argue that $X(\ast)$ is merely inhabited. Since $X$ is regular, we have $\sum_{(b:BG)} X(b)$ contractible. This gives a center of contraction $(b,x)$. Now, since $BG$ is connected, it follows that $\|b=\ast\|$. Since we are proving the mere proposition $\|X(\ast)\|$, we get to use $b=\ast$. Now we obtain $\|X(\ast)\|$ . 

Next, to show that $\tilde{X}$ is regular we need to show that $\tilde{X}$ has a contractible total space. The type $\sum_{(b : BAut_G(X))} \tilde{X}(b)$ is equivalent to $\sum_{(P:BG \to U)} \|P=X\| \times P(\ast)$. Contractibility is a mere proposition, and we have $\|X(\ast)\|$, so we get to use a point $x:X(\ast)$. This gives us a center of contraction $(X,refl,x)$ of the total space of $\tilde{X}$. 

Now let $P : BG \to U$, let $ \| P = X \|$, let $p_0 : P(\ast)$. To show regularity, it suffices to find a term of type

$\sum_{\alpha : P = X} \mathrm{trans}(\alpha)(p_0) = x$

This type is equivalent to showing that there are

$K : \prod_{b:BG} P(b) \simeq X(b)$, and
$K(*,p_0) = x_0$

Now we use that $X(b)$ is equivalent to $b=\ast$ (we get this fact from regularity, together with a point $x:X(\ast)$). 
Since we need this particular fiberwise equivalence, it suffices to show that

$\sum_{b:BG} P(b)$

is contractible. Now this is a mere proposition, so we can eliminate $t : \| P = X \|$ to obtain the proof.

###### Proposition
If $X$ is a principal homogeneous space on $G$, in the sense that the type $\sum_{(g:G)} g_\ast(x)=y$ is contractible for all $x,y:X(\ast)$, and $\tilde{X}$ is regular, then $X$ is regular.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Again, we first show that $X(\ast)$ is merely inhabited. The total space of $\tilde{X}$ has center of contraction $(P,p_0)$. Since $\|P=X\|$ and since we are proving a mere proposition, we get to use $P=X$. Now $\|X(\ast)\|$ follows from $p_0:P(\ast)$. The regularity of $X$ is a mere proposition, so we get to use $x_0:X(\ast)$. This gives us the center of contraction $(\ast,x_0)$. It remains to show that

$\prod_{(b:BG)} \prod_{(x:X(b))} \sum_{(\alpha : b=\ast)} \mathrm{trans}(\alpha,x) = x_0$.

Of course, it would suffice to prove the stronger statement

$\prod_{(b:BG)} \prod_{(x:X(b))} \mathrm{isContr} (\sum_{(\alpha : b=\ast)} \mathrm{trans}(\alpha,x) = x_0)$.

However, now we get to use that $BG$ is connected. Therefore it suffices to show that

$\prod_{x:X(*)} isContr (\sum_{\alpha : G} \mathrm{trans}(\alpha,x) = x_0)$

This holds by assumption.
