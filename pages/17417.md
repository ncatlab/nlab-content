## Definition

An [[action]]

$$
  \rho : G \times X \to X
$$

of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **regular** if it is both [[transitive action|transitive]] and [[free action|free]], that is, if for any pair of elements $x,y \in X$, there is _exactly one_ group element $g \in G$ such that $g x = y$.

## Examples

* The action of $G$ on itself by multiplication $\cdot : G \times G \to G$ (on the left or on the right) is a regular action, called the (left or right) [[regular representation]] of $G$.

* A (oriented) [[combinatorial map]] can be viewed as a transitive action of the (oriented) [[cartographic group]], which is regular just in case it represents a _regular map_ ([Siran 2006](#SiranSurvey)).  For example, the five [[Platonic solids]] may be represented as regular combinatorial maps.
