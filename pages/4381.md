The **permutation groupoid**, sometimes denoted $\mathbb{P}$, is a [[skeleton]] of the [[groupoid]] of finite sets and bijections.  Namely:

$$ \mathbb{P} = \bigsqcup_{n \ge 0} S_n \, , $$

where objects are natural numbers, all morphisms are automorphisms, and the automorphisms of the object $n$ form the group $S_n$. 

In other words, $\mathbb{P}$ is equivalent to the [[core]] of [[FinSet]].
