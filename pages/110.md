A **morphism** is what goes between [[object|objects]] in a [[category]].  

Given two objects in a category, say $x$ and $y$, there is a set $hom(x,y)$, called a [[hom-set]], whose elements are morphisms from $x$ to $y$.  Given a morphism $f$ in this hom-set, we write $f:x \to y$ to indicate that it goes from $x$ to $y$.

The most familiar example is the category [[Set]], where the objects are sets and the morphisms are functions.  Here if $x$ and $y$ are sets, a morphism $f: x \to y$ is a function from $x$ to $y$.

More generally, a morphism is what goes between objects in any [[n-category]].
