Proto CLF is a work-in-progress proof assistant design combining ideas from [[Nuprl]], [[LF]], and undecidable [[type checking]] based on subsumptive [[equality types]]. "CLF" abbreviates "Computational Logical Framework". So far, it's just unpublished metatheory development, but information may appear here.
