###### Definition
**(finer/coarser topologies)**

Let $X$ be a [[set]], and let $\tau_1, \tau_2 \in P(X)$ be two [[topological space|topologies]] on $X$,
hence two choices of [[open subsets]] for $X$, making it a [[topological space]]. If

$$
  \tau_1 \subset \tau_2
$$

hence if every open subset of $X$ with respect to $\tau_1$ is also regarded as open by $\tau_2$, then 
one says that

* the topology $\tau_2$ is _finer_ than the topology $\tau_2$

* the topology $\tau_1$ is _coarser_ than the topology $\tau_1$.

###### Example
**(discrete and co-discrete topology)**

Let $S$ be any [[set]]. Then there are always the following two extreme
possibilities of equipping $X$ with a topology $\tau \subset P(X)$, and hence making it a [[topological space]]:

1. $\tau \coloneq P(S)$ the set of _all_ open subsets; 

   this is called the _[[discrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[finer topology|finest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$,
   
   we write $Disc(S)$ for the resulting topological space;

1. $\tau \coloneqq \{ \emptyset, S \}$ the set contaning only the [[empty set|empty]] subset of $S$ and all of $S$ itself;

   this is called the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[coarser topology|coarsest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$
   
   we write $CoDisc(S)$ for the resulting topological space.
