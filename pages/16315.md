Let $k$, $E$ be [[fields]], with $k \hookrightarrow E$ a [[field extension]], also written as $E/k$. The _transcendence degree_ of $E/k$ is the [[cardinality]] of a maximal set of elements of $E$ that are [[matroid|algebraically independent]] over $k$. 

The transcendence degree is well-defined, i.e., independent of which maximal set of algebraically independent elements is used. This is commonly proven by invoking a Mac Lane-Steinitz *exchange axiom*; see [[matroid]] for a general argument.
