$\mathbf{Prof}$ is the [[2-category]] of [[categories]], [[profunctors]], and [[natural transformations]].  If profunctors are [[categorification|categorified]] [[binary relations]], then $Prof$ is a categorification of [[Rel]].

Recall that a profunctor from $A$ to $B$ is a functor $B^{op}\times A\to Set$.  Composition of profunctors in $Prof$ is by the "tensor product of functors" [[coend]] construction: if $H\colon A\to B$ and $K\colon B\to C$, their composite is given as a functor $C^{op}\times A \to Set$ by
$$(c,a)\mapsto \int^{b\in B} H(b,a)\times K(c,b).$$
The identity on a category $A$ is its hom-functor $Hom_A(-,-)$.

Note that as defined here, $Prof$ is a weak $2$-[[2-category|category]] or [[bicategory]].  A naturally defined equivalent [[strict 2-category]] has the same objects, but the morphisms $A\to B$ are [[cocontinuous functor]]s $P A \to P B$, where $P A$ is the [[presheaf category]] of $A$.  This is equivalent because a profunctor $A\to B$ can equivalently be regarded as a functor $A\to P B$, and $P A$ is the [[free cocompletion]] of $A$.

Note that every functor $f\colon A\to B$ gives two [[representable functor|representable]] profunctors $B(f-,-)$ and $B(-,f-)$.  This defines two [[2-functors]] $Cat \to Prof$ that are  the identity on objects.  The relationship between [[Cat]] and $Prof$ encoded in this way makes them into an [[equipment]].

There are also [[enriched category|enriched]] and [[internal category|internal]] versions of $Prof$.
