**Optics** studies light. **Light** is an electromagnetic phenomenon and it corresponds to the special solutions of the Maxwell equations for the [[electromagnetic field]]. Of course, specific methods and applications pertain to optics, which are not used that much in the rest of electromagnetism. 

Light has both corpuscular and [[wave]] nature. Corpuscular nature is represented by quanta of [[electromagnetic field]], photons. 

For applications but also fundamental theoretical consideration there is an important approximation of [[geometrical optics]].
