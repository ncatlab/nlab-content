## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] what has come to be known as the _holographic principle_ is the fact that the [[partition function]]s of some [[quantum field theories]] of [[dimension]] $n$ may be identified with [[state]]s of [[TQFT]]s of dimension $n + 1$.

Notice that for $\Sigma$ an $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold with $n$-dimensional [[boundary]] $\partial \Sigma$, regarded as a [[cobordism]] $\Sigma : \emptyset \to \partial \Sigma$, an $(n+1)$-dimensional TQFT assigns a morphism

$$
  Z(\Sigma) : 1 \to Z(\partial \Sigma)
  \,,
$$

hence an element of the space $Z(\partial \Sigma)$. Under holography, this element is identified with the [[partition function]] of an $n$-dimensional QFT evaluated on the manifold (without boundary) $\partial \Sigma$.


## Examples

### Poisson $\sigma$-model / quantum mechanics

Ordinary [[quantum mechanics]] induced by [[quantization]] of a [[Poisson manifold]] -- which may be regarded as a 1-dimensional QFT -- is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional [[Poisson sigma-model]] 
(implicitly observed by ([Kontsevich](#Kontsevich)) made explicit by ([CattaneoFelder](#CattaneoFelder)).

### A-model / quantum mechanics

Similarly the [[A-model]] on certain [[D-brane]]s gives a holographic description of ordinary [[quantum mechanics]]. ([Witten](#WittenAModel)).

See

* [[quantization via the A-model]]

### Chern-Simons theory / WZW-model

3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory for a group $G$ is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional [[WZW-model]].

### Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory / Self-dual higher gauge theory
 {#HigherDimCSAndSelfDualQFT}

#### Idea and examples

Generally, [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]
in dimension $4k+3$ (for $k \in \mathbb{N}$) is holographically related to [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] in dimension $4k+2$ (at least in the abelian case). 

* $(k=0)$: ordinary 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] is related to a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] on its boundary;

* $(k=1)$: 7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a [[fivebrane]] model on its boundary;

* $(k=2)$: 11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a parts of a [[type II string theory]] on its bounday (or that of the space-filling 9-[[brane]], if one wishes) ([BelovMoore](#BelovMoore)).


#### Some details

We indicate why [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] is -- if holographically related to anything -- holographically related to [[self-dual higher gauge theory]].

The [[phase space]] of [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] in [[dimension]] $4k+3$ on $\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}$ can be identified with the space of [[curvature|flat]] $2k+1$-forms on $\Sigma$. The [[presymplectic form]] on this space is given by the pairing

$$
  (\delta B_1, \delta B_2) \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma \delta B_1 \wedge \delta B_2
  \,.
$$

The [[geometric quantization]] of the theory requires that we choose a polarization of the [[complexification]] of this space (split the space of forms into "coordinates" and their "canonical momenta"). 

One way to achieve this is to choose a [[conformal structure]] on $\Sigma$. The corresponding [[Hodge star operator]]

$$
  \star : \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \to \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)
$$

provides the polarization by splitting into self-dual and anti-self-dual forms: 

notice that (by the formulas at [[Hodge star operator]]) we have on mid-dimensional forms

$$
  \star \star B = (-1)^{(2k+1)(4k+3)} B
  = - B
  \,.
$$

Therefore it provides a [[complex structure]] on $\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \otimes \mathbb{C}$.

We see that the symplectic structure on the space of forms can equivalently be rewritten as

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_X B_1 \wedge B_2
    & = - \int_X B_1 \wedge \star \star B_2 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here on the right now the [[Hodge star operator|Hodge inner product]] of $B_1$ with $\star B_2$ appears, which is invariant under applying the Hodge star to both arguments.

We then decompose $\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)$ into the $\pm i$-[[eigenspace]]s of $\star$: say $B \in \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)$ is  _imaginary self-dual_ if

$$
  \star B = i B
$$

and _imaginary anti-self-dual_ if

$$
  \star B = - i B
  \,.
$$

Then for imaginary self-dual $B_1$ and $B_2$ we find that the symplectic pairing is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (B_1, B_2)
    &=
    -i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
    \\
    & =
    -i \int_X (\star B_1) \wedge \star (\star B_2)
    \\
    & =    
    +i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
  \end{aligned} 
  \,.
$$

Therefore indeed the symplectic pairing vanishes on the self-dual and on the anti-selfdual forms. Evidently these provide a decomposition into [[Lagrangian subspace]]s.


Therefore a [[state]] of higher Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma$ may locally be thought of as a function of the self-dual forms on $\Sigma$. Under holography this is (therefore) identified with the [[correlator]] of a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] on $\Sigma$.

### Ads/CFT

#### Type II on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and $d = 4$ super Yang-Mills

Conjecturally, [[type II string theory]] on a [[anti-de Sitter space]] background is holographically dual to [[super Yang-Mills theory]] on the asymptotic boundary.

See [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

#### M-theory on $AdS_7 \times S_4$ and 6d $(2,0)$-SCFT on M5 branes

[[11-dimensional supergravity|M-theory]] on $AdS_7 \times S^4$ is supposed to have as holographic boundary the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]]. See there for references.

#### M-theory on $AdS_4 \times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$ and Chern-Simons on M2 branes
