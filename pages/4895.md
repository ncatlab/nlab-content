## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] what has come to be known as the _holographic principle_ is the fact that the [[partition function]]s of some [[quantum field theories]] of [[dimension]] $n$ may be identified with [[state]] of QFTs in dimension $n + 1$:

### Self-dual higher gauge fields and higher abelian Chern-Simons

The idea of describing [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] by abelian Chern-Simons theory in one dimension higher originates in 

* [[Edward Witten]], _Five-Brane Effective Action In M-Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9610234))

* [[Edward Witten]], _Duality Relations Among Topological Effects In String Theory_ ([arXiv:hep-th/9912086](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9912086))

More discussion of the general principle is in 

* Dmitriy Belov, [[Greg Moore]], _Holographic Action for the Self-Dual Field_ ([arXiv:hep-th/0605038](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0605038))

A quick exposition of the basic idea is in

* [[Jacques Distler]], _Actions for self-dual gauge fields_ ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000809.html))

The application of this to the description of type II [[string theory]] in 10-dimensions to 11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is in the followup

### In $d = 3$

3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] in the context of holography is discussed for instance in

### General abstract

An identification of boundary conditions and [[QFT with defects|defects]] as [[natural transformation]]s between higher dimensional [[FQFT]]s is discussed in
