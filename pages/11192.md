## Idea

The _T-duality 2-group_ is a [[smooth 2-group]] (or rather a class of such) which controls [[T-duality]] and [[T-folds]]. It is the [[string 2-group]] for the [[cup product]] [[universal characteristic class]] on [[fiber products]] of [[torus]]-[[fiber bundles]] with their dual torus bundles.

## Definition

For $T$ a [[torus]] and $\tilde T$ its dual torus, there is the [[cup product]] [[universal characteristic class]]

$$
  \langle -\cup -\rangle \;\colon\;B T \times B \tilde T \longrightarrow K(\mathbb{Z}, 4)
  \,.
$$

This has a smooth refinement to morphism of [[smooth groupoids]]/[[moduli stacks]]

$$
  \langle -\cup -\rangle \;\colon\;\mathbf{B} T \times \mathbf{B} \tilde T \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  \,.
$$

In fact it has furthermore a differential refinement to a [[universal Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle with connection]]

$$
  \langle -\cup -\rangle_{conn} \;\colon\;(\mathbf{B} T \times \mathbf{B} \tilde T)_{conn} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
$$

of which the above is obtained by forgetting the connections ([FSS 12, section 3.2.1](#FSS12))

As such this is the [[local Lagrangian]] of abelian [[Chern-Simons theory]] with two abelian gauge field species (the [[diagonal]] is 3d abelian CS theory itself).

This universal class is suitably equivariant under the action of the integral T-duality group $O(n,n,\mathbb{Z})$, so that one may consider ([Nikolaus 14](#Nikolaus14))

$$
  \langle -\cup -\rangle \;\colon\;\mathbf{B} T \times \mathbf{B} \tilde T // O(n,n,\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  \,.
$$

As for the [[string 2-group]], this defines an [[infinity-group extension]] (the looping of the [[homotopy fiber]] of this map) and this one may call the _T-duality 2-group_ as it controls T-duality pairs by the discussion at _[[T-Duality and Differential K-Theory]]_. Indeed, according to ([Nikolaus 14](#Nikolaus14)) the [[principal 2-bundles]] for this 2-group are the correct formalization of the concept of _[[T-folds]]_.
