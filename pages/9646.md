Scattering is a physical process in which some matter or wave which has stable, say linear trajectory (or wave distribution) in distant past, comes into the area where it interacts with some localized perturbation (or other such waves), which results in different stable state (or distribution of states) in far future.  Examples include light scattering, scattering of matter beams, scaterring of solitons and multisolitons
(which preserve their identity after a long while), and scattering n quantum mechanics
and QFT. The condition that the perturbation (interaction) is localized is someties relaxed (for example 

Basic concepts are time evolution operator, adiabatic switching, [[interaction picture]] and the ingoing and outgoing states.
