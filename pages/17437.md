A __collineation__ is a bijection from a projective space to a projective space of the same finite dimension which preserves the inclusions of subspaces. Equivalently, it is often defined by a seemingly weaker condition, which is also used in the infinite-dimensional case: a collineation is a bijection of projective spaces which sends each triple of collinear points into a triple of collinear points.

A __projective collineation__ is a collineation such that its restriction to every projective hyperplane is a projective isomorphism. 

A __perspective collineation__ is a (projective) collineation from a projective plane to itself such that the restriction to one, and hence to any projective line is a perspectivity onto its image line.

Similarly, a __correlation__ is a bijection from a projective space to a projective space of the same finite dimension which reverses the inclusions of subspaces. 

The terms _collineation_ and _correlation_ have been introduced into projective geometry
by Moebius in 1827.
