A collineation is a bijection from a projective space to a projective space of the same finite dimension which preserves the inclusions of subspaces. 

A projective collineation is a collineation such that its restriction to every projective hyperplane is a projective isomorphism. 

A perspective collineation is a (projective) collineation from a projective plane to itself such that the restriction to one, and hence to any projective line is a perspectivity onto its image line.

Similarly, a correlation is a bijection from a projective space to a projective space of the same finite dimension which reverses the inclusions of subspaces.
