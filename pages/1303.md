A __ringed space__ is a pair $(X,O_X)$ where $X$ is a topological space and $O_X$ is a sheaf of rings. A __morphism of ringed spaces__ $(f,f^\sharp):(X,O_X)\to (Y,O_Y)$ is a pair
where $f:X\to Y$ is a continuous map and the __comorphism__ $f^\sharp : O_Y\to f_* O_X$ is a morphism of sheaves of rings over $Y$. Here $f_*$ denotes the direct image functor for sheaves.
