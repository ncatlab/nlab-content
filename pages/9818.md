## Idea

In ([Connes-Marcolli 04](#ConnesMarcolli04)) is considered a [[differential equation]] satisfied by divergences appearing in the [[Hopf algebra]] formulation of [[renormalization]] (see there).  This leads to a [[category]] of "equisingular flat connections" that turns out that to be a [[Tannakian category]], meaning that it is equivalent to the [[category of modules]] over some pro-algebraic group $G$. The authors observe that $G$ [[action|acts]] on any renormalizable [[theory (physics)|theory]] in a nice way. Due to this property [[Pierre Cartier]] refered to this as the _cosmic Galois group_ 

This cosmic Galois group $G$ is (non-canonically) isomorphic to some [[motivic Galois group]].
