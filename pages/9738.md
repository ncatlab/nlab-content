## Idea

Let $G$ be a [[connected]] [[semisimple]] [[algebraic group]] over the [[field]] of [[rational numbers]] $\mathbf{Q}$ or more generally over a [[global field]] $K$.  The **Tamagawa measure** of $G$ is a canonical normalization of the [[Haar measure]] on $G$.  (Recall that the latter is well-defined only up to scalar multiplication.)

The **Tamagawa number** of $G$ is essentially the Tamagawa measure of the [[quotient]] [[coset space]] $G(K)\backslash G(\mathbf{A}_K)$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is the ring of [[adeles]] of $K$. 

This is [[conjecture|conjectured]] and known in many cases to be a [[rational number]], the quotient $Pic/Sha$ of the [[order of a group|order]] of the [[Picard group]] divided by that of the [[Tate-Shafarevich group]]. ([MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/q/44184/381))

###### Remark
For $G= GL_1 = \mathbb{G}_m$ the [[multiplicative group]] then the quotient $G(\mathbf{Q})\backslash G(\mathbf{A})$ is the [[idele class group]].

###### Remark


The further [[stacky quotient]] of G(\mathbf{Q})\backslash G(\mathbf{A}) by $G(\mathbb{A}_[\mathbb{Z}})$ is [[analogy|analogous]], under the [[function field analogy]] and in view of the [[Weil uniformization theorem]], with an incarnation of the [[moduli stack of bundles|moduli stack of G-principal bundles]] over a [[curve]]. A relation of the Tamagawa numbers to the properties of this stack is the content of the [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]].)
