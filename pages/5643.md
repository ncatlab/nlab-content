## Idea

A _smooth super $\infty$-groupoid_ is a [[super ∞-groupoid]] equipped with _smooth_ [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesion]].

This includes [[supermanifold]]s and [[delooping]]s of [[super Lie group]]s.


## Definition

We conceive a smooth super $\infty$-groupoid as [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] but not over the [[base topos]] [[∞Grpd]] of bare [[∞-groupoid]]s, but over the [[base topos]] [[Super∞Grpd]] of [[super ∞-groupoid]]s.

Recall from the discussion at _[[super ∞-groupoid]]_ that there is a canonical [[line object]] 

$$
  \mathcal{R} \in SuperSet \hookrightarrow Super\infty Grpd
$$

which as a presheaf on the [[site]] of [[superpoint]]s is given by

$$
  \mathcal{R} : \mathbb{R}^{0|q} \mapsto (\Lambda_q)_{even}
  \,,
$$

where $\Lambda_q$ is (the underlying set of) the [[Grassmann algebra]] on $q$ generators, and $(\Lambda_q)_{even}$ is (the underlying set of) its even part.

###### Definition

Write $sCartSp$ for the [[internal site]] in $SuperSet \hookrightarrow$ [[Super∞Grpd]] whose

* [[object]]s are the [[product]]s $\mathbb{R}^{}$s for $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

* [[morphism]]s are those morphisms of supersets that are smooth with respect to the canonical [[supermanifold]] structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (see the section [As manifolds over the base topos on superpoints](#http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/supermanifold#OverSuperpoints))
].

* [[coverage]] is given by the internal [[good open cover]]s.

###### Definition

Let

$$
  SmoothSuper\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(sCartSp, Super \infty Grpd)
$$

be the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of internal [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] in [[Super∞Grpd]] over the [[internal site]] $sCartSp$.
