
## Idea

In [[type IIA string theory]] there appears 

* $SU(N)$ [[enhanced gauge symmetry]] on $N$-coincident [[D-branes]];

* $SO(2N)$ enhanced gauge symmetry on $N$-coincident [[D-branes]] at an [[orientifold plane]].

The gauge bosons of these [[gauge fields]] are the modes of the [[open strings]] stretching between these D-branes which become massless as the branes coincide.

As the situation is lifted to [[M-theory]], the [[D0-branes]], [[D2-branes]] and [[D4-branes]] lift to [[M2-branes]] and [[M5-branes]], and the gauge enhancement is thought to be similarly reflected on these [[M-branes]] (as exhibited for the [[M2-branes]] by the [[BLG-model]] and [[ABJM-model]]).
On the other hand, the [[D6-brane]] lifts not to an [[M-brane]], but to a configuration of the field of [[gravity]]: the 11d [[Kaluza-Klein monopole]].

Here we discuss how the gauge enhancement on [[D6-branes]] in [[type IIA string theory]] is reflected on [[Kaluza-Klein monopoles]] at [[ADE-singularities]]. This is due to ([Sen 97](#Sen97))
