## Idea

In [[type IIA string theory]] there appears 

* $SU(N)$ [[enhanced gauge symmetry]] on $N$-coincident [[D-branes]];

* $SO(2N)$ enhanced gauge symmetry on $N$-coincident [[D-branes]] at an [[orientifold plane]].

The gauge bosons of these [[gauge fields]] are the modes of the [[open strings]] stretching between these D-branes which become massless as the branes coincide.

As the situation is lifted to [[M-theory]], the [[D0-branes]], [[D2-branes]] and [[D4-branes]] lift to [[M2-branes]] and [[M5-branes]], and the gauge enhancement is thought to be similarly reflected on these [[M-branes]] (as exhibited for the [[M2-branes]] by the [[BLG-model]] and [[ABJM-model]]).
On the other hand, the [[D6-brane]] lifts not to an [[M-brane]], but to a configuration of the [[field (physics)|field]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]: the 11d [[Kaluza-Klein monopole]].

Here we discuss how the gauge enhancement on [[D6-branes]] in [[type IIA string theory]] is reflected on [[Kaluza-Klein monopoles]] at [[ADE-singularities]]. This is due to ([Sen 97](#Sen97)).

## Construction

### $A_{N-1}$-singularity and $SU(N)$-gauge enhancement

The 11d multi-centered [[Kaluza-Klein monopole]] [[spacetime]] has [[metric tensor]] of the form

$$
  ds^2 
     \coloneqq 
    - d t^2 
    + \underoverset{n = 5}{10}{\sum} d y^n d y^n
    + ds^2_{TN}
  \,,
$$

where 

$$
  ds^2_{TN} 
    \coloneqq
  V^{-1}( d x^4 + \vec \omega \cdot d \vec r )^2 + V d \vec r^2
$$

is the metric tensor of the multi-centered [[Taub-NUT space]], with $x^4$ the canonical coordinate on a [[circle]] and with 

$$
  V \coloneqq 1 + \underoverset{I = 1}{N}{\sum} \frac{4m}{{\vert \vec r - \vec r_I\vert}}
$$

and

$$
  \vec \nabla \times \vec \omega = - \vec \nabla V
$$

for $\{\vec r_I\}_{I =1}^N$ the set of positions of the KK-monopoles of mass $m$.

Notice that the radius $16 \pi m V^{-1/2}$ of the $x^4$-circle vanishes precisely at the positions $\vec r_I$. Nevertheless, as long as  all the $\vec r_I$ are distinct, then the above is a smooth spacetime also at the positions of the $\vec r_I$ -- if the periodicity of $x^4$ is taken to be $16 \pi m$. 
But with this periodicity fixed, then as the $N$ monopole positions $\vec r_I$ coincide, then the resulting metric has a [[conical singularity]] at that point, of type $A_{N-1}$, i.e. with a [[deficit angle]] as induced by the canonical action of the [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/N$ on [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^3$.

To see where the gauge enhancement arises from in this singular case, observe that in the non-singular configuration there are $N-1$ linearly indepent 2-[[cycles]] $S_{i j}$ in the multi-center KK-monopole spacetime, represented by the the [[2-spheres]] that are swept out by the circle fiber as it moves from $\vec r_i$ to $\vec r_j$ (remembering that the circle fiber radius vanishes precisely at the positions $\vec r_I$). 


For the canonical choice of straight path between $\vec r_i$ and $\vec r_j$ (and arbitrary fixed position in the remaining 7 dimensions) then the [[surface]] [[area]] of these [[2-spheres]] is

$$
  vol(S_{i j}) = 16 \pi m  {\vert \vec r_i - \vec r_j\vert}
  \,.
$$

For any other choice of path the surface area will be larger. Hence an [[M2-brane]] with tension $T_{M2}$ [[wrapped brane|swrapping]] the 2-[[cycle]] $S_{i j}$ has minimal tension energy when in the configuration of these spheres, namely

$$
  m_{i j} = 16 \pi m T_{M2} {\vert \vec r_i - \vec r_j\vert}
  \,.
$$

The type IIA limit is given by $m \to 0$. In this limit the [[M2-branes]] wrapping the above cycles become the type IIA [[superstring]] by [[double dimensional reduction]], the [[KK-monopoles]] become the [[D6-branes]], and it is evident from the geometry that the membrane warpping $S_{i j}$ becomes an [[open string]] strentching between the $i$th and the $j$th D6-brane.

In the limit $m \to 0$ the D6-branes coincide,the strings stretching between them become massless (in accord with the above formula for the wrapped M2-brane mass), and become the gauge bosons of an $SU(N)$ [[Chan-Paton gauge field]].

This gauge enhancement hence must have been present above in the M-theory situation, too.
