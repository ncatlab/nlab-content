## Idea

_Irreducible ideals_ generalize [[prime ideals]] by replacing [[ideal product|multiplication]] of [[ideals]] with [[intersection]].  In [[lattices]] (or [[prosets]] more broadly), where multiplication of ideals *is* intersection, they are the same as prime ideals; this is true in some other cases, such as the [[ring of integers]]; for this reason, the term 'irreducible ideal' is not used much in [[order theory]].  There is also an infinitary version, the _completely irreducible ideals_ (called 'completely prime' in order theory, although they are different from the [[completely prime ideals]] of noncommutative ring theory).  They are related to [[irreducible elements]] but don\'t line up perfectly.


## Definitions

Let $R$ be a [[ring]], or more generally a [[rig]], possibly even [[nonassociative ring|nonassociative]], or even just a [[monoid]], possible just a [[magma]]; or on the other hand a [[lattice]], or even just a [[proset]].  In other words, anything with a concept of _[[ideals]]_.  In the noncommutative case, we could be talking about left ideals, right ideals, or two-sided ideals; pick a meaning and stick with it.  We need the concept of [[intersection]] of ideals (which all of these have), and that\'s pretty much it; that is, we use the structure of the [[meet-semilattice]] $Idl(R)$ of ideals of $R$.

###### Definition

An ideal $I$ of $R$ is __irreducible__ if $I$ is [[proper ideal|proper]] and, whenever $I$ contains the intersection of two ideals of $R$, $I$ contains at least one of those two ideals:
$$ \forall\, J \in Idl(R),\; \forall\, K \in Idl(R),\; I \supseteq J \cap K \;\Rightarrow\; I \supseteq J \;\vee\; I \supseteq K .$$
The ideal $I$ is __completely irreducible__ if, whenever $I$ contains the intersection of any collection of ideals of $R$, $I$ contains at least one of the ideals in that collection:
$$ \forall\, \mathcal{J} \subseteq Idl(R),\; I \supseteq \bigcap \mathcal{J} \;\Rightarrow\; \exists\, J \in Idl(R),\; J \in \mathcal{J} \;\wedge\; I \supseteq J .$$

## Copied material to be incorporated

An (left, right, or two-sided) [[ideal]] $I$ is __irreducible__ if it is [[proper ideal|proper]] and, whenever it is written as the [[intersection]] of two ideals (of the same kind) $I = J \cap K$, then at least one of $J$ and $K$ equals $I$.  Or without [[bias]], whenever $I$ is an intersection of a finite list of ideals, it equals at least one ideal on the list.  This is the same requirement as for a [[prime ideal]], replacing multiplication of ideals with intersection.  In particular, prime ideals and irreducible ideals are equivalent for lattices (so the term 'irreducible' is usually not used in order theory), while every prime ideal in a rig is irreducible (but not always conversely).  An ideal is __completely irreducible__ (called 'completely prime' in order theory) if whenever $I$ is an intersection of any (possibly infinite) collection of ideals, $I$ is equal to at least one of them.  (This is _not_ analogous to [[completely prime ideals]].)  Note that an ideal generated by an [[irreducible element]] is irreducible, but not always conversely.  The terminology may make more sense to think of an irreducible [[antiideal]] (the complement of an ideal) or an irreducible [[filter]] (the dual concept to an ideal in order theory), where irreducibility is about [[unions]] instead of intersections.
