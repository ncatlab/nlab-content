## Idea


The traditional [[Chern character]] on [[complex K-theory]] happens to be a map from [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] of [[chromatic level]] 1 to one of chromatic level 0 ([[ordinary cohomology]]).

More generally, one may ask for _higher chromatic Chern characters_ that map a [[generalized cohomology theory]] of some [[chromatic level]] to another of some other level.

This has been considered for

* maps from [[elliptic cohomology]]/[[tmf]] to [[K-theory]], see at _[[elliptic Chern character]]_

* maps from [[Morava E-theory]] at level $(n+1)$ to Morava E-theory at level $n$, tensored with some ring, see at _[[E-theoretic Chern character]]_.
