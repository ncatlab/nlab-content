[[!redirects symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal categories enriched over modules over $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-algebras]]

##Idea

A conjectural characterization of [[symmetric powers]] in [[symmetric monoidal categories]] [[enriched]] over [[modules]] over a $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-[[associative algebra]] is described here. The description in terms of universal properties would be equivalent to a much longer one but much more constructive in algebraic terms. It would be similar to the characterization of products known as Fox theorem but where products are replaced by symmetric powers. We work in symmetric monoidal categories enriched over modules over a $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-algebra. The adaption to $CMon$-enriched symmetric monoidal categories would involve symmetric and divided powers which are equal in this simpler setting. This conjecture seems to be true and if is the case, the proof is not trivial.

##Conjecture
We suppose that the symmetric monoidal categories are strict monoidal categories.

\begin{definition}
We say that a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ possesses the $n$-th symmetric ($n \ge 0$) iff it possesses this coequalizer for every $A \in \mathcal{C}$:
\begin{tikzcd}
A^{\otimes n} \arrow[rr, "\sigma", shift left=3] \arrow[rr, "...", shift right=3] &  & A^{\otimes n} \arrow[rr, "r_{n}(A)"] &  & A^{\otimes_{s}n}
\end{tikzcd}
and $r_{n}(A):A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow A^{\otimes n}$ is a natural transformation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A functorial special bicommutative graded bimonoid in a $CMon$-enriched symmetric monoidal category is given by:

* a family $(!_{n}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{C})_{n \ge 0}$ of endofunctors
* a family $(\nabla_{n,p}:!_{n}A \otimes \oc_{p}A \rightarrow !_{n+p}A)_{n,p \ge 0}$ of natural transformations
* a family $(\delta_{n,p}:!_{n+p} \rightarrow !_{n}A \otimes !_{p}A)_{n,p \ge 0}$ of natural transformations

such that:

* $!_{0}A=I$
* $!_{1}A=A$
* for every $A \in \mathcal{C}$, $(A,(\nabla_{n,p})_{n,p \ge 0}, (\delta_{n,p})_{n,p \ge 0})$) is a special bicommutative graded bimonoid ie.:

* $\gamma;\nabla_{n,p} = \nabla_{n,p}$ (commutativity)
* $\delta_{n,p};\gamma = \delta_{n,p}$ (cocommutativity)
* $\nabla_{n,0}=1$ (unitality)
* $\delta_{n,0}=1$ (counitality)
* $(\nabla_{n,p} \otimes 1);\nabla_{n+p,q} = (1 \otimes \nabla_{p,q});\nabla_{n,p+q}$ (associativity)
* $\delta_{n+p,q};(\delta_{n,p} \otimes 1) = \delta_{n+p,q};(1 \otimes \delta_{p,q})$
(coassociativity)
* if $n+p = q+r$, then $\nabla_{n,p};\delta_{q,r} = \underset{\substack{a,b,c,d \ge 0 \\ a+b=n \\ c+d=p \\ a+c=q \\ b+d=r}}{\sum} (\delta_{a,b} \otimes \delta_{c,d});(1 \otimes \gamma \otimes 1);(\nabla_{a,c} \otimes \nabla_{b,d})$
(compatibility multiplication/comultiplication)
* $\delta_{n,p};\nabla_{n,p} = \binom{n+p}{n}$
(specialty)
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
Let $R$ be a $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-algebra. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a symmetric monoidal category enriched over $R$-modules. Let $(!_{n}:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C})_{n \ge 0}$ such that $\oc_{0}A=I$ and $\oc_{1}A = A$. Then there is a bijection between family of natural transformations $(r_{n}A:A^{\otimes_{n}} \rightarrow !_{n}A)_{n \ge 0}$ which make $(!_{n}A)$ symmetric powers and family of natural transformations $(\nabla_{n,p}:!_{n}A \otimes !_{p}A \rightarrow !_{n+p}A)_{n,p \ge 0}, (\delta_{n,p}:)_{n,p \ge 0}:!_{n+p}A \rightarrow \oc_{n}A \otimes \oc_{p}A)$ which make $(!_{n}A)$ a functorial special bicommutative graded bimonoid.
\end{conjecture}
