## Idea

While a [[category]] is a called a [[pointed category]] if it has a [[zero object]], i.e. if it has an [[initial object]] and a [[terminal]] object and both are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], for a _quasi-pointed category_ the last condition is relaxed.

#Definition#

A category is **quasi-pointed** if it has an [[initial object]] $0$, a [[terminal object|final object]] $1$ and its unique [[morphism]] $0\to 1$ is a [[monomorphism]].
