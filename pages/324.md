## Definition

In any [[category]], a **cospan** is a diagram like this:
$$
  \array{
     && a &&&& b
      \\
      & 
      && {}_{f}\searrow
       &
       & \swarrow_g
      && 
     \\     
     &&&&
     c
     &&&&
  }
$$


A cospan in the category $C$ is the same as a [[span]] in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.  So, all general facts about cospans in $C$ are general facts about spans in $C^{op}$, and the reader may turn to the entry on [[span|spans]] to learn more.

A cospan that admits a [[cone]] is called a [[quadrable cospan]].

Cospans in a category $V$ with small colimits form a [[bicategory]] whose objects are the objects of $V$, whose morphisms are cospans between two objects, and whose 2-morphisms $\eta$ are commuting diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    && S
    \\
    & {}^{\sigma_{S}}\nearrow && \nwarrow^{\tau_S}
    \\
    a &&\downarrow^\eta&& b
    \\
    & {}_{\sigma_T}\searrow
    && \swarrow_{\tau_T}
    \\
    && T
  }
  \,.
$$

The category of cospans from $a$ to $b$ is naturally a [[enriched category|category enriched in]] $V$: for

$$
  \array{
    && S
    \\
    & {}^{\sigma_{S}}\nearrow && \nwarrow^{\tau_S}
    \\
    a &&&& b
    \\
    & {}_{\sigma_T}\searrow
    && \swarrow_{\tau_T}
    \\
    && T
  }
$$

two parallel cospans in $V$, the $V$-object 
${}_a[S,T]_b$
of morphisms between them is the pullback

$$
  \array{
    {}_a[S,T]_b
     &\to&
     pt
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\sigma_T \times \tau_T}
    \\
    [S,T] &\stackrel{\sigma_S^* \times \sigma_T^*}{\to}& 
    [a \sqcup b, T]
  }
$$

formed in analogy to the enriched hom of [[pointed object]]s.

If $V$ has a terminal object, $pt$, then cospans from $pt$ to itself are [[bi-pointed object]]s in $V$.
