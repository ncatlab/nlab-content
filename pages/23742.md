## Definition ##

In [[constructive mathematics]], a [[set]] $X$ has __stable equality__ if any two [[elements]] of $X$ are [[equality|equal]] if (hence iff) they are [[double negation|not not]] equal.  

## Examples ##

* Every [[set]] with [[decidable equality]] has stable equality, but not conversely.
