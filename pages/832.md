Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then a __$1$-poset__ is an $\infty$-category such that every $2$-morphism is an [[equivalence]] and all [[parallel pair]]s of $j$-morphisms are equivalent for $j \geq 1$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $1$-morphisms, not even whether two given parallel $1$-morphisms are equivalent. Up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], therefore, all that is left in this definition is a [[partial order|poset]].  Thus one may also say that a __$1$-poset__ is simply a poset.

The point of all this is simply to fill in the general concept of $n$-[[n-poset|poset]]; nobody thinks of $1$-posets as a concept in their own right except simply as posets.  Compare $1$-[[1-category|category]] and $1$-[[1-groupoid|groupoid]], which are defined on the same basis.
