## Definition

A _real structure_ on a [[complex vector space]] $V$ is an [[antilinear map]] $\sigma \colon V \to V$ which is an [[involution]].

Equivalently this is a [[real vector space]] $W$ and an [[isomorphism]] $V \simeq W \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ of $V$ with its [[complexification]].
