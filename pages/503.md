The concept of Cauchy completeness, ordinarily thought of as applying to [[metric space]]s, was vastly generalized by Bill Lawvere in his influential paper "Metric spaces, generalized logic, and closed categories". It is now seen by category theorists as a concept of [[enriched category]] theory, with close ties to the concept of [[Morita equivalence]] in the theory of modules. 

The basic idea is that the Cauchy completion of a category is the closure of a category under what are called "absolute limits", i.e., limits that are preserved by any functor whatsoever. Equivalently, the Cauchy completion is the closure with respect to absolute colimits. If $C$ is small, the Cauchy completion $\bar{C}$ of $C$ lies between $C$ and its "[[free cocompletion]]", aka [[presheaf]] category

$$C \hookrightarrow \bar{C} \hookrightarrow Set^{C^{op}}$$ 

(see the entry at [[presheaf]] for "free cocompletion"), and consists of those presheaves $F$ dubbed [[tiny object|tiny]] by Lawvere, meaning those presheaves which are connected and projective: the functor 

$$hom_{Set^{C^{op}}}(F, -): Set^{C^{op}} \to Set$$ 

preserves small coproducts and coequalizers. All of these concepts generalize straightforwardly to the context of general $V$-enriched categories, where $V$ is a complete, cocomplete, symmetric monoidal closed category. 


## Discussion 

_Todd_: I envision starting with the example $V = [0, \infty]$ before treating other bases $V$ such as $Set$ and $Ab$.

_Toby_: Although the term comes from $[0,\infty]$, readers might find it easier to understand in $\Set$, where we usually study limits first. That said, you should write whichever you want, and people will add to it.

_Todd_: Um, I _think_ I understand how the wiki works, Toby, so I while I appreciate your giving me permission to write however I please, I wasn't actually asking for any. I was just stating some intent. That said, some things are easier for the $Set$ case, and some are easier for the case $[0, \infty]$. I'll get back to this in a bit. Thanks. 

_Toby_: Sorry, I interpreted it more broadly as a suggestion for future development rather than individual intent. (That is, 'I envision that we should start with ...' rather than 'I envision that I shall start with ...'.) So I added my own suggestion; but then it sounded like I might be telling you what to do, so I disclaimed that. In other words, of course you don\'t need my permission, but I didn\'t want to leave you with the impression that I was trying to stop you either.

_Todd_: Okay, that makes sense. It would have been clearer had I said "I plan to...": in a sense I was both thinking to myself and also letting people know what I was thinking. Anyway, thanks for clarifying, and I promise to try to add some more intellectual content to this so far scintillating conversation we're having. ;-) 

_Toby_:  I just read this again after a couple of months, and I think that I was just completely stupid.  Of course one should start with $[0, \infty]$!

_David_: So is Cauchy completion, $C \hookrightarrow \bar{C} \hookrightarrow Set^{C^{op}}$, like $\mathbb{Q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow 2^{\mathbb{Q}}$? Perhaps that should be smaller on the right. I read somewhere that a way to see the reals as coalgebraic is that they can be seen (in terms of Dedekind cuts) as subsets/predicates of the rationals. Where you tend to see one as a subset of the other, it may be better to think of it in terms of a duality into 2.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I think that's not unreasonable, but a more precise analogy would be to
$$\mathbb{Q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow [0,\infty]^{\mathbb{Q}^{op}}$$
where $[0,\infty]^{\mathbb{Q}^{op}}$ is of course the $[0,\infty]$-enriched functor category.  In this case, it's the metric space whose points are [[short map]]s $f\colon \mathbb{Q}\to [0,\infty]$ and where $d(f,g) = sup_{x\in\mathbb{Q}} |f(x)-g(x)|$.  The Yoneda embedding $\mathbb{Q}\hookrightarrow [0,\infty]^{\mathbb{Q}^{op}}$ of course sends a point $y$ to $d(-,y)$.

David: Thanks, Mike. So in an ideal world I'd work out how the reals are [[tiny object|tiny objects]]. I've put in a definition Todd gave at the Caf&eacute;. We want $hom_{[0,\infty]^{\mathbb{Q}^{op}}}(r, -)$ to preserve colimits? $max(d(r, f), d(r, g)) = d(r, max(f, g))$. Hmm, better to work such things out offline.

I'd be grateful if someone could explain here the result (of Barr?) that on Set the terminal F-coalgebra is the Cauchy completion of the initial F-algebra. If this is true for other categories, perhaps this includes the unit real interval as the Cauchy completion of dyadic rationals in the interval.
