# Definition

In [[model theory]], an **elementary embedding** is an [[injection]] that preserves and reflects all first-order logic.  That is, it is an injection $f\colon M\to N$ such that for any formula $\varphi$ and parameters $a_1,\dots,a_n\in M$, we have
$$ M \vDash \varphi(a_1,\dots,a_n) \iff N \vDash \varphi(f(a_1),\dots, f(a_n)). $$
If $f$ is (interpreted as) the inclusion of a [[subset]], we say that $M$ is an **elementary substructure** of $N$.


# In material set theory

Elementary embeddings play an important role in the study of [[large cardinals]] in (material) [[set theory]].

For instance, the existence of a [[measurable cardinal]] is equivalent to the existence of a non-[[surjection|surjective]] elementary embedding $j\colon V\to M$, where $V$ is the universe of sets and $M$ is some [[transitive set|transitive]] model of [[ZF]].  If $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal with a countably-complete [[ultrafilter]] $\mathcal{U}$, we can form the [[ultrapower]] $V^{\mathcal{U}}$ and then take its [[transitive collapse]] to produce $M$.  (Countable completeness of $\mathcal{U}$ is necessary for $V^{\mathcal{U}}$ to be well-founded and thus have a transitive collapse.)

Conversely, if $j\colon V\to M$ is a nontrivial elementary embedding, it must have a *critical point*, i.e. a least ordinal $\kappa$ such that $j(\kappa)\neq \kappa$.  It follows that $j(\kappa)$ is some [[ordinal]] $\gt \kappa$, so in particular $\kappa\in j(\kappa)$ (using the von Neumann definition of ordinals).  Define $\mathcal{U}\subset P(\kappa)$ by $A\in \mathcal{U}$ iff $\kappa\in j(A)$; then $\mathcal{U}$ is a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter on $\kappa$.

Stronger large cardinal axioms can be characterized, or defined, as the critical points of elementary embeddings satisfying additional closure axioms on the transitive class $M$.


# In structural set theory

Any elementary embedding of models of ZF induces a [[conservative functor|conservative]] [[logical functor]] between their categories of sets.  In fact, it is much more than that; a conservative logical functor preserves and reflects only first-order logic with bounded quantifiers, while an e.e. preserves and reflects all first-order logic.

The structural meaning of elementary embeddings seems not to be well-explored.


# Inconsistency

The "ultimate" closure property, hence the "strongest" large cardinal axiom, would be having a nontrivial elementary embedding $j\colon V\to V$ (i.e. $M$ is all of $V$).  Sometimes the critical point of such an embedding, if one exists, is called a *Reinhardt cardinal*.  However, having such an e.e. turns out to be inconsistent...sort of.

The technicality is that because any e.e. $V\to V$ is a [[proper class]], the proposition "there does not exist an e.e. $V\to V$" cannot be stated in ZF (one cannot quantify over proper classes).  What we can prove is the following meta-theorem (one instance per formula $\varphi(x,y)$ that might define an e.e.).

###### Meta-Theorem
For any formula $\varphi(x,y,z)$ and any set $a$, it is not true that defining $j_a(x)=y \iff \varphi(x,y,a)$ makes $j_a$ into an elementary embedding $V\to V$.

###### Proof
Suppose that $\varphi$ and $a$ exist.  Fix such a $\varphi$.  Fix $\lambda$ as the smallest ordinal such that there exists an $a\in V_\lambda$ such that $\varphi(-,-,a)$ defines an e.e. $V\to V$.  Now the statement "$\lambda$ is the smallest ordinal such that there exists an $a\in V_\lambda$ such that $\varphi(-,-,a)$ defines an e.e. $V\to V$." is definable in the language of ZF (definability of the property "is an e.e. $V\to V$" is tricky, but true).  Therefore, if $b$ is any set such that $j_b$ is an e.e., it preserves the truth of this, so it is also true that $j_b(\lambda)$ is the smallest ordinal such that there exists an $a\in V_{j_b(\lambda)}$ such that $\varphi(-,-,a)$ defines an e.e. $V\to V$.  This clearly implies that $j_b(\lambda)=\lambda$.

Now define $\kappa$ to be the smallest ordinal which is a critical point of an e.e. $V\to V$ of the form $j_a$ for some $a\in V_\lambda$.  Let $b\in V_\lambda$ be such that $j_b$ is an e.e. $V\to V$ and $\kappa$ is the critical point of $j_b$.  The definition of $\kappa$ is again a definable property, so it follows that $j_b(\kappa)$ is the smallest ordinal which is a critical point of an e.e. $V\to V$ of the form $j_a$ for some $a\in V_{j_b(\lambda)} = V_\lambda$.  Therefore, $\kappa= j_b(\kappa)$, a contradiction to $\kappa$ being the critical point of $j_b$.
=--

Now, if we work instead in a theory such as [[NBG]] or [[MK]] which can contain *non-definable* proper classes, in theory there might still be an e.e. $V\to V$ which is not definable.  One can also access such an idea by adding a new symbol "$j$" to ZF and asserting that it is an e.e.  However, it was shown by Kunen in 1971, using a technical combinatorial argument, that the existence of such an e.e. is inconsistent with the [[axiom of choice]].  It is unknown whether it is consistent with [[ZF]].
