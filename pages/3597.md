## Idea

In [[quantum mechanics]] a **density matrix** is a linear endomorphism of a [[Hilbert space]] of states that represents a [[statistical ensemble]] of [[quantum state]]s.

## Notation

In the following definition, we use Dirac's "bracket" notation for vectors where a state vector, describing the state of a quantum system, is represented by a "ket" which is a column vector,

$|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle=
\left(
\begin{aligned}
\vdots \\
x_{n-1} \\
x_{n} \\
x_{n+1} \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}
\right)$.

The [[Hermitian adjoint]], $\langle\psi_{\alpha}|=(|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle)^{\dagger}$, is called a "bra" (hence "bra(c)ket") and is a row vector.

## Mixed states

Suppose we have a [[quantum state]] $Q$ that arises from some random process such that the state $|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle$ has a probability $p_{\alpha} \in [0,1]$ (we often speak of having 'prepared' the state with the associated probability).  The possible states $|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle$ need not be orthogonal and we thus call such a collection of states, a *mixed state*.  More specifically, a mixed state is often described as an *ensemble* of quantum systems.

Suppose we now measure some observable **A** on the system as a whole, i.e. on the ensemble.  The expectation value of **A** over the subset $|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle$ is $\langle A \rangle_{\alpha}=\langle\psi_{\alpha}|$**A**$|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle$.  Over the entire ensemble, this becomes

$\langle A \rangle = \sum_{\alpha}p_{\alpha}\langle A \rangle_{\alpha} = \sum_{\alpha}p_{\alpha}tr|\psi_{\alpha}\rangle\langle\psi_{\alpha}|$**A**.

## Density operator

Given the above, we define the *density operator* to be

$\mathbf{\rho}=\sum_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha \, |\psi_{\alpha}\rangle\langle\psi_{\alpha}|$.

We call the matrix representation of the density operator, the *density matrix*.

## Coherence

Diagonal density matrices with at least two non-zero terms on the diagonal represent *mixed states*.  Density matrices that posses non-zero off-diagonal terms represent *superposition states*.  Such states are referred to as *coherent* and the off-diagonal entries are called the *coherences*.  Any physical process that has the effect of suppressing the coherences is known as *decoherence*.

## Limitations

Note that a density operator, as the representation of the state of a quantum system, is less restrictive than a state vector which specifies the wavefunction.  However, this does mean that the density operators are not unique, i.e. two entirely different state vectors can give rise to the same density operator.
