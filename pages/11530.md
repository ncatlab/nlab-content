## Idea

The _Sullivan conjecture_ (due to [[Dennis Sullivan]], now a [[theorem]] due to [[Haynes Miller]]) states that under certain conditions and after suitable [[p-adic integers|p-adic]] [[completion]] the canonical map for a [[G-space]] from its ordinary [[fixed points]] to its [[homotopy fixed points]] is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].
