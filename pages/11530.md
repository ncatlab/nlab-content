## Idea

The _Sullivan conjecture_ (due to [[Dennis Sullivan]], now a [[theorem]] due to [Miller 84](#Miller84)) states that -- under certain conditions and after suitable [[p-adic integers|p-adic]] [[completion]] -- the canonical map for a [[G-space]] from its ordinary [[fixed points]] to its [[homotopy fixed points]] is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

A [[proof]] was given in [Carlsson 91](#Carlsson91), using the [[Segal-Carlsson theorem]].
