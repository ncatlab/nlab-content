## Idea

In the [[category]] [[Set]], the [[initial algebra]] [[algebra for an endofunctor|for the endofunctor]] $F: X \to 1 + X$ is $\langle 0, s \rangle : 1 + \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of [[natural numbers]], $0$ is the smallest natural number, and $s$ is the [[successor]] operation. The principle of induction states that there is no proper [[subobject|subalgebra]] of $\mathbb{N}$; that is, the only subalgebra is $\mathbb{N}$ itself. This follows from the general property of [[initial objects]] that [[monomorphisms]] to them are [[isomorphisms]].

More generally, the corresponding property of any initial algebra may be called __induction__. We then have induction over [[lists]], [[trees]], terms in a [[logic]], and so on.

The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of _[[coinduction]]_.
