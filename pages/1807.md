There are many related constructions of algebras, topological algebras and so on which bear the name of a convolution algebra. The simplest, but pretty general construction is the following.

Let $k$ be a commutative unital [[ring]], $(C,\Delta)$ a (counital) $k$-[[coalgebra]] and $(A,m)$ an associative (unital) $k$-[[algebra]]. Then the set of linear maps

$$
\mathrm{Hom}_k(C,A)
$$

has a structure of an associative (unital) algebra, called __convolution algebra__. The product of two linear maps $f,g$ is given by

$$f\star g = m\circ(f\otimes g)\circ\Delta. $$
