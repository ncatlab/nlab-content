## Idea

The definition of _geodesic convexity_ is like that of _[[convexity]]_ , but with straight lines in a [[Euclidean space]] generalized to [[geodesics]] in a [[Riemannian manifold]] or [[metric space]].

## Definition

### In a Riemannian manifold

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[Riemannian manifold]] and $C \subset X$ a [[subset]]. We say that $C$ is

* **weakly geodesically convex** if for any two points from $C$ there exists exactly one minimizing [[geodesic]] in $C$ connecting them;

* **geodesically convex** if for any two points in $C$ there exists exactly one minimizing geodesic in $X$ connecting them, and that geodesic arc lies completely in $C$

* **strongly geodesically convex** if for any two points in $C$ there exists exactly one minimizing geodesic in $X$ connecting them, and that geodesic arc lies completely in $C$; and furthermore there exists no nonminimizing geodesic inside $C$ connecting the two points.

###### Definition

The **convexity radius** at a point $p \in X$ is the [[supremum]] (which may be $+ \infty$) of $r \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $\eta \lt r$ the geodesic ball $B_p(r)$ is strongly geodesically convex. 

The convexity radius of $(X,g)$ is the [[infimum]] over the points $p \in X$ of the convexity radii at these points.

## Properties

+-- {: .un_proposition}
###### Proposition

At any point $p \in X$ of a Riemannian manifold, the convexity radius is positive.

=--

This is due to ([Whitehead](#Whitehead)).


+-- {: .un_proposition}
###### Proposition

If $X$ is a [[compact space]] then the convexity radius of $(X,g)$ is positive.

This is reproduced for instance as proposition 95 in ([Berger](#Berger))

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Every [[paracompact manifold]] admits a complete [[Riemannian metric]] with bounded absolute sectional curvature and positive injectivity radius.

This is shown in ([Greene](#Greene)).
