## Idea

Broadly speaking, _quantum logic_ is meant to be a kind of [[formal logic]] that is to traditional formal logic as [[quantum mechanics]] is to [[classical mechanics]].

The first proposal for such a formalization was ([Birkhoff-vonNeumann 1936](#BirkhoffvonNeumann36)), which suggested that given a [[quantum mechanical system]] with a [[Hilbert space]] [[space of states|of states]], the logical [[propositions]] about the system are to correspond to (the [[projections]] to) [[closed subspaces]], with [[implication]] given by inclusion of such subspaces, hence that quantum logic is given by the [[lattice]] of closed linear subspaces of Hilbert spaces. 

This formalization is often understood as being the default meaning of "quantum logic". But the proposal has later been much criticized, for its lack of key properties that one would demand of a [[formal logic]]. For instance in ([Girard 11, page xii](#Girard11)) it says:

>  Among the magisterial mistakes of logic, one will first mention [[quantum logic]], whose ridiculousness can only be ascribed to a feeling of superiority of the language – and ideas, even bad, as soon as they take a written form – over the physical world. Quantum logic is indeed a sort of punishment inflicted on nature, guilty of not yielding to the prejudices of logicians... just like Xerxes had the Hellespont – which had destroyed a boat bridge – whipped.

Therefore later other proposals as to what quantum logic should be have been made, and possibly by "quantum logic" in the general sense one should understand any formal framework which is supposed to be able to _express_ the statements whose [[semantics]] is the totality of all what is verifiable by [[measurement]] in a [[quantum system]].

In particular it can be argued that flavors of _[[linear logic]]_ and more generally _[[linear type theory]]_ faithfully capture the essence of [[quantum mechanics]] ([Abramsky-Duncan 05](#AbramskyDuncan05), [Duncan 06](#Duncan06), see ([Baez-Stay 09](#BaezStay09)) for an introductory exposition) due to its [[categorical semantics]] in [[symmetric monoidal categories]] such as those used in the desctiption of [[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]]. In particular the [[category]] of (finite dimensional) [[Hilbert spaces]] that essentially underlies the Birkhoff-vonNeumann quantum logic interprets [[linear logic]].

Another candidate for quantum logic has been argued to be the [[internal logic]] of [[Bohr toposes]] .

In [[quantum computing]] the quantum analog of classical [[logic gates]] are called _quantum logic gates_.

## Approaches

### Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic

It is based on the setting the [[Hilbert lattice]] (of closed suspaces of a Hilbert space) to represent the set of propositions of quantum system.
