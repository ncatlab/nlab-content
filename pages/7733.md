A *variety* may denote

* [[algebraic variety]] 
* [[analytic variety]]
* [[variety of algebras]] in [[universal algebra]]

In the first two cases, at least locally, varieties are given by satisfaction of a family of equations, given by polynomials (algebraic variety), analytic functions (analytic variety). The  variety of algebras consists to some extent similarly of algebras satisfying some list of equations for algebraic operations true for any elements in the place of free variables.
