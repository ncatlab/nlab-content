## Idea

The _superstring_ 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] is the analog of the [[string]] $\sigma$-model but with local [[worldsheet]] [[supersymmetry]]. 

This is the higher dimensional analog of how the [[superparticle]] is related to the ordinary [[relativistic particle]].

There are several different incarnations of the superstring.

* the **[[spinning string]]** or **[[NSR string]]** has in fact local [[worldsheet]] [[supersymmetry]];

* the **[[Green-Schwarz superstring]]** instead has manifest [[target space]] supersymmetry.

* a mixture between the two has been proposed: the **[[Berkovits superstring]]** .
