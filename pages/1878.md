# Idea  #

A [[model category]] $C$ is _cofibrantly generated_ if there is a [[set]]
(meaning: small set, not a proper class) of cofibrations and one of
trivial cofibrations, such that all other (trivial) cofibrations are
_generated_ from these.

Ths property of being cofibrantly generated is particularly tractable
and useful in the case that the model category is a 
[[presentable category]]. In this case one speaks of a
[[combinatorial model category]].

# Definition #

We first give the simple definition that applies in the case that
the model category in question is [[presentable category|presentable]].

For $S \subset Mor(C)$ any collection of morphisms, write

* ${}_{\perp} S$ for the collection of morphisms with the _right_ 
  [[weak factorization system|lifting property]] with respect to $S$;
  
* $S_\perp$ for the collection of morphisms with the _left_ 
  [[weak factorization system|lifting property]] with respect to $S$;
  
**Definition**

A [[model category]] $C$ that is a [[presentable]] category is 
**cofibrantly generated** if there is a small [[set]] $C_0 \subset Mor(C)$ 
of cofibrations such that the collection $C$ of all cofibrations is

$$
  C = ({}_\perp C_0)_\perp
  \,.
$$

Notice that necessarily

$$
  C_0 \subset ({}_\perp C_0)_\perp
$$

There is another way to characterize $({}_\perp C)_\perp$.

**Definition**

A collection $S \subset Mor(C)$ of morphisms is called 
**closed under pushout, retract and transfinite composition** if ...

**Proposition** 

If $C$ is [[presentable category|presentable]], and $C_0$ is any set
of morphisms, then $({}_\perp C_0)_\perp$ is 
the smallest collection containing $C_0$ that is closed under 
pushout, retracts and transfinite composition.

Proof. Use the [[small object argument]].
