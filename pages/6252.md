## Definition

Let $A:H\to H$  be an [[unbounded operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$. An unbounded operator $A^*$ is its __adjoint__ if

* $(Ax|y) = (x|A^*y)$ for all $x\in dom(A)$, $y\in dom(A^*)$
* every $B$ satisfying the above property for $A^*$ is a restriction of $A$

An adjoint does not need to exist in general. 

An unbounded operator is **symmetric** if $dom(A)\subset dom(A^*)$ and $A x = A^*x$ for all $x\in dom(A)$ (one also writes $A\subset A^*$).

The domain of $A^*$ is the set of all vectors $y\in H$ such that the linear functional
$x\mapsto (Ax|y)$ is bounded on $dom(A)$. 

The graph $\Gamma_A\subset H\oplus H$ satisfies $\Gamma_{A^*} = \tau(\Gamma_A)^\perp$ where $\perp$ denotes the orthogonal complement and $\tau$ denotes the transposition of the direct summands changing the sign of one of the factors, i.e. $x\oplus y\mapsto -y\oplus x$. An unbounded operator $A$ is __closed__ if $\Gamma_A$ is closed subspace of $H\oplus H$. An operator $B$ is a closure of an operator $A$ if $\Gamma_B$ is a closure of operator $\Gamma_A$. It is said that $B$ is an extension of $A$ and one writes $B\supset A$ if $\Gamma_B\supset \Gamma_A$. The closure of an unbounded operator does not need to exist. 

For any unbounded operator $A$ with a dense $dom(A)\susbet H$, if the adjoint operator $A^*$ exists, $A^*$ is closed, and if $(A^*)^*$ exists then it coincides with a closure of $A$.

An [[unbounded operator]] $A : H\to H$ on a Hilbert space $H$ is __self-adjoint__ if

* it has a densely defined domain $dom(A)\subset H$
* $A = A^*$, i.e. $dom(A^*)= dom(A)$ and $Ax=A^*x$ for all $x\in dom(A)$

An (unbounded) operator is __essentially self-adjoint__ if it is symmetric and its spectrum is a subset of the real line. Alternatively, it is symmetric if its closure is self-adjoint. 

A __Hermitean__ (or __hermitian__) operator is the same as a self-adjoint operator, though some authors prefer that terminology for bounded self-adjoint operators.

For a bounded operator $A: H\to K$ between Hilbert spaces define the Hermitean conjugate operator $A^*: K\to H$ by $(Ax|y)_H = (x|A^*y)_K$, for all $x\in K$, $y\in H$. Distinguish it from the concept of the [[transposed operator]] $A^T: K^*\to H^*$ between the [[dual vector space|dual spaces]].
