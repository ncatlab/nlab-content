Let $A:H\to H$  be an [[unbounded operator]] on a Hilbert space $H$. An unbounded operator $A^*$ is its __adjoint__ if

* $(Ax|y) = (x|A^*y)$ for all $x\in dom(A)$, $y\in dom(A^*)$
* every $B$ satisfying the above property for $A^*$ is a restriction of $A$

An [[unbounded operator]] $A : H\to H$ on a Hilbert space $H$ is __self-adjoint__ if

* it has a densely defined domain $dom(A)\subset H$
* its adjoint $A^*$ equals $A$
