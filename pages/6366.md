The category is __unital in the sense of Bourn__ if it has a zero object ([[pointed category]]), admits finite limits and for all objects $X,Y$ the pair of maps $(id_X,0) : X\to X\times Y$, $(0,id_Y): Y\to X\times Y$ is (jointly) strongly epimorphic.

This terminology is introduced in 

* D. Bourn, _Mal'cev categories and fibrations of pointed objects_, Appl. Cate-
gorical Structures __4__ (1996) 302-327

Exposition is in the section 1.2 in 

* F. Borceux, D. Bourn, [[Borceux-Bourn|Malâ€™cev, protomodular, homological and semi-abelian categories]], Mathematics and Its Applications __566__, Kluwer 2004

Unfortunately the terminology is not compatible with the notions of unitality of $A_\infty$-categories.
