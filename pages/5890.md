###### Theorem
**(Kuiper's theorem)**

For $\mathcal{H}$ a separable infinite-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]], the [[unitary group]] $U(\mathcal{H})$, regarded naturally as a [[topological group]], is [[contractible]].

The original paper proved that it was contractible in the 
[[operator topology]].  Atiyah and Segal note in their paper on twisted K-theory that there is an easy proof of contractibility in the 
[[weak opeator topology]].  One major difference in the topologies is that with the operator topology then it is a [[CW-complex]] but with the weak topology then it isn't even an ANR.
