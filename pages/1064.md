## Definitions

There is a sequence of extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure and property]] on a [[category]] that makes this category behave like a general context for [[homological algebra]]. In order of increasing structure and property this is:

1. **[[Ab-enriched category]]**:
  a [[category]] that is [[Ab]]-[[enriched category|enriched]];

2. **[[pre-additive category]]**:
  an $Ab$-enriched category that has a [[terminal object]] or [[initial object]] and therefore a [[zero object]]; Notice however that many authors (e.g. Weibel, Popescu) by preadditive (or pre-additive) simply mean $Ab$-enriched. 

   * [[pseudo-abelian category]]: a pre-additive category such that every [[idempotent]] has a [[kernel]] and [[cokernel]]

3. **[[additive category]]**: a pre-additive category that admits binary [[product]]s or binary [[coproduct]]s and therefore binary [[biproduct]]s (equivalently, an $Ab$-enriched category with all finite products or coproducts);

4. **[[pre-abelian category]]**:
  an additive category that admits [[kernel]]s and  [[cokernel]]s (equivalently, an $Ab$-enriched category with all finite [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s);

5. **[[abelian category]]**:
  a pre-abelian category such that every [[monomorphism]] is a kernel and every [[epimorphism]] is a cokernel (and many other equivalent definitions).

Pre-abelian and abelian categories are sometimes called (AB1) and (AB2) categories, after the sequence of additional axioms on top of additive categories introduced by Grothendieck in [[Tohoku]].  AB1 and AB2 are self-dual axioms (AB1 is existence of kernels and cokernels, and AB2 requires that, for any $f$, the canonical morphism $\mathrm{Coim}\,f\to \mathrm{Im}\,f$ is an isomorphism). These continue in non-selfdual manner:

* AB3: an abelian category with all coproducts (hence with all [[colimit]]s);

* AB4: an (AB3) category in which coproducts of monomorphisms are monic;

* AB5: an (AB3) category in which [[filtered colimits]] of [[exact sequence]]s exist and are exact;

* AB6: an (AB3) category such that
  * for every object $A$ in $C$ and any family $B^j$ with $j \in J$ of directed families $B^j = B^j_i$ with $i in I_j$ the intersections of [[subobject]]s  over $j$ commute with direct sums over $j$.
  * Notice that this implies that inf for any family of subobjects exists.

The concepts (AB3--AB6) also have dual forms (AB3*--AB6*).

There are further refinements along these lines. In particular

* [[Grothendieck category]]: an (AB5) category with a [[generator]].


## Further refinements

Various further axiom structures are considered for additive (sometimes abelian) categories.

* [[suspended category]]

* [[triangulated category]]

* [[Quillen exact category]]

* [[Grothendieck category]]:  an AB5-category with a [[generator]]

* Gabriel's [[property sup]]


## Generalizations 

* Abelian groups are to general [[group]]s as [[abelian category|abelian categories]] are to [[semi-abelian category|semi-abelian categories]].


## Examples

Various generic classes of examples of additive and abelian categories are of relevance:
