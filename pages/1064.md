There is a sequence of extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure and property]] on a [[category]] that makes this category behave like a general context for [[homological algebra]]. In order of increasing structure and property this is:

1. **[[pre-additive category]]**:
  a [[category]] that is [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enriched]];

1. **[[additive category]]**: a [[pre-additive category]] that admits finite [[product]]s and therefore finite [[coproduct]]s and [[biproduct]]s;

1. **[[pre-abelian category]]**:
  an [[additive category]] that admits [[kernel]]s and therefore also [[cokernel]]s;

1. **[[abelian category]]**:
  a [[pre-abelian category]] such that every [[monomorphism]] is a [[kernel]] and every [[epimorphism]] is a [[cokernel]].
