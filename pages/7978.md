  [website](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~tfrankel/) (with errata and preface for 3rd edition)

On methods of [[differential geometry]] and their meaning and use in [[physics]], especially [[gravity]] and [[gauge theory]].

Awesome in part for using [[pseudoforms]] instead of just assuming that everything\'s [[orientation|oriented]] — and what\'s more, explaining the physical meaning of this!  (But it still uses [[Riemannian metric|metrics]] more than necessary.)
