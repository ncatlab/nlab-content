## Definition

###### Definition

A [[site]] is called a **local site** it 

* it has a [[terminal object]] $*$;

* the only [[covering]] family of $*$ is the trivial cover.

=--

This appears as ([Johnstone example C.3.6.3 (d) ](#Johnstone)).

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[category of sheaves]] $Sh(C)$ on a local site $C$ is a [[local topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Since $C$ has a terminal object, the [[global section]] functor $Sh(C) \to Set$ is given by evaluation on that object, hence is precomposition of sheaves with the inclusion $* \to C$. At the level of presheaves this has a right [[Kan extension]] functor, given by sending a set $S$ to the presheaf

$$
  \nabla S : U \mapsto S^{C(*,U)}
  \,.
$$

This is indeed a sheaf if $*$ is covered only by the trivial cover.
