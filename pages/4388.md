## Idea

An automaton is an abstract concept of machine, modelled as a collection of states and transitions between states, together with an assignment of some external behavior (typically input and/or output) to these transitions.  A quintessential example of an automaton is a vending machine, which can be in any number of different states (e.g., "READY", "INSERT 2 TOKENS", "OUT OF SERVICE", etc.), and will transition between these states in response to user input (e.g., from "READY" to "INSERT 2 TOKENS" after the user makes a selection, and from "INSERT 2 TOKENS" to "INSERT 1 TOKEN" after the user inserts a token).

Many different notions of automaton exist in the literature.  For now this article only considers one fairly basic notion taken from [[Joy of Cats]], although it is by no means the simplest nor the most general.

## Definition

A __deterministic, sequential, Moore automaton__ is formally definable (as in [[Joy of Cats]]) as a sextuple ($Q$, $\Sigma$, $Y$, $\delta$,  $q_{0}$, $y$), where $Q$ is the set of states,  $\Sigma$ and $Y$ are the sets of input symbols and output symbols, respectively,  $\delta$:  $\Sigma$ $\times$ $Q$ $\to$ $Q$ is the transition map, $q_{0}$ $\epsilon$ $Q$ is the initial state, and $y$: $Q$ $\to$ $Y$ is the output map.  [[morphism|Morphisms]] from an automaton ($Q$, $\Sigma$, $Y$, $\delta$,  $q_{0}$, $y$) to an automaton ($Q$&#8242;, $\Sigma$&#8242;, $Y$&#8242;, $\delta$&#8242;,  $q_{0}$&#8242;, $y$&#8242;) are triples ($f_{Q}$, $f_{\Sigma}$, $f_{Y}$) of [[function|functions]] $f_{Q}:  Q \to Q\prime$,  $f_{\Sigma}: \Sigma \to \Sigma\prime$,  and $f_{Y}:  Y \to Y\prime$ satisfying the following conditions:

(i) preservation of transition: 
    $\delta\prime$($f_{\Sigma}$($\sigma$), $f_{Q}$($q$)) =      $f_{Q}$($\delta$($\sigma$, $q$)),

(ii) preservation of outputs: $f_{Y}$($y$($q$)) = $y$$\prime$($f_{Q}$($q$)),

(iii) preservation of initial state: 
      $f_{Q}$($q_{0}$) = $q_{0}\prime$.    

Note that in such an automaton, the outputs are determined by the current state alone (and do not depend directly on the input).

A morphism $f$ : ($Q$, $\delta$, $q_{0}$, $F$) $\to$ ($Q\prime$, $\delta\prime$, $q_{0}\prime$, $F\prime$) (called a __simulation__) is a function $f : Q \to Q\prime$ that preserves:

(i) the transitions, i.e., $\delta\prime$($\sigma$, $f$($q$)) = $f$($\delta$($\sigma$, $q$)),

(ii) the initial state, i.e., $f$($q_{0}$) = $q_{0}\prime$, and

(iii) the final states, i.e., $f[F] \subseteq F\prime$.


## The category of automata

There is a [[category]] $Aut$ whose [[object|objects]] are deterministic sequential Moore automata and whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are simulations.

## Examples

* [[Moore machine]]

* [[Mealy machine]]

## Variants


There are several variant forms of automaton.  The above just gives a basic one. Others are treated in the entries:

* [[asynchronous automaton]];

* [[deterministic automaton]];

* [[nondeterministic automaton]].

There are tentative definitions of 

*[[higher dimensional automaton]]

which take a more nPOV of automata theory.
