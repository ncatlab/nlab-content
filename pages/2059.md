An [[algebraic variety]] or an algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is __normal__ if at every point $p$ the [[stalk]] $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is an [[integrally closed domain]]. For every variety $X$ there is a morphism $X\to \mathcal{X}$ which is universal among all morphisms from $X$ into normal varieties; $\mathcal{X}$ (or more precisely $\mathcal{X}$ together with the universal morphism) is said to be the __normalization of__ $X$.
