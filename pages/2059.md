## Idea

An [[algebraic variety]] or an algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is __normal__ if at every point $p$ the [[stalk]] $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is an [[integrally closed domain]]. For every integral scheme $X$ there is a scheme $\mathcal{X}$ and a morphism $\mathcal{X} \to X$ which is universal among all dominant morphisms from normal schemes into $X$; $\mathcal{X}$ (together with the universal morphism) is said to be the __[[normalization]] of__ $X$.
