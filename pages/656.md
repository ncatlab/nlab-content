## Idea

A _bimodule_ is a [[module]] in two compatible ways over two [[algebras]].

## Definition

Let $V$ be a [[closed monoidal category]]. Recall that for $C$ a category [[enriched category|enriched over]] $V$, a $V$-[[module]] is a $V$-functor $\rho : C \to V$. We think of the objects $\rho(a)$ for $a \in Obj(C)$ as the objects on which $C$ acts, and of $\rho(C(a,b))$ as the action of $C$ on these objects.

In this language a $C$-$D$ _bimodule_ for $V$-categories $C$ and $D$ is a $V$-functor

$$
  C^{op} \otimes D \to V
  \,.
$$

Such a functor is also called a profunctor or [[distributor]].

Some points are in order. Strictly speaking, the construction of $C^{op}$ from a $V$-category $C$ requires that $V$ be symmetric (or at least braided) monoidal. It's possible to define $C$-$D$ bimodules without recourse to $C^{op}$, but then either that should be spelled out, or one should include a symmetry. (If the former is chosen, then closedness one on side might not be the best choice of assumption, in view of the next remark; a more natural choice might be biclosed monoidal.) 

Second: bimodules are not that much good unless you can compose them; for that one should add some cocompleteness assumptions to $V$ (with $\otimes$ cocontinuous in both arguments; biclosedness would ensure that), and consider smallness assumptions on the objects $C$, $D$, etc. ---Todd.

## Examples

* Let $V = Set$ and let $C = D$.  Then the hom functor $C(-, -):C^{op} \times C \to Set$ is a bimodule.  Bimodules can be thought of as a kind of generalized hom, giving a set of morphisms (or object of $V$) between an object of $C$ and an object of $D$.

* Let $\hat{C} = Set^{C^{op}}$; the objects of $\hat{C}$ are "generating functions" that assign to each object of $C$ a set.  Every bimodule $f:D^op \times C \to Set$ can be curried to give a Kleisli arrow $\tilde{f}:C \to \hat{D}$.  Composition of these arrows corresponds to convolution of the generating functions. 

  +--{.query}
  [[Todd Trimble|Todd]]: I am not sure what is trying to be said with regard to "convolution". I know about Day convolution, but this is not the same thing. 

  Also, with regard to "Kleisli arrow": I understand the intent, but one should proceed with caution since there is no global monad $C \mapsto \hat{C}$ to which Kleisli would refer. Again there are size issues that need attending to.

* Let $V = Vect$ and let $C = \mathbf{B}A_1$ and $D = \mathbf{B}A_2$ be two one-object $Vect$-enriched categories, whose endomorphism vector spaces are hence [[algebra]]s. Then a $C$-$D$ bimodule is a vector space $V$ with an action of $A_1$ on the left and and action of $A_2$ on the right.

## Properties

### As morphisms in a 2-category
 {#AsMorphismsInA2Category}

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and consider bimodules over $R$-algebras.

+-- {: .num_prop #AlgebrasAndBimodules}
###### Proposition

There is a [[2-category]] whose 

* [[objects]] are $R$-[[algebras]];

* [[1-morphisms]] are bimodules;

* [[2-morphisms]] are [[intertwiners]].

The [[composition]] of 1-morphisms is given by the [[tensor product of modules]] over the middle algebra.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[2-functor]] from the above 2-category of algebras and bimodules to [[Cat]] which

* sends an $R$-algebra $A$ to its [[category of modules]] $Mod_A$;

* sends a $A_1$-$A_2$-bimodule $N$ to the [[tensor product]] [[functor]]

  $$
    (-)\otimes_{A_1} N
    \;\colon\;
    Mod_{A_1} \to Mod_{A_2}
  $$

* sends an [[intertwiner]] to the evident [[natural transformation]] of the above functors.

###### Proposition

This construction has as its image precisely the [[colimit]]-preserving [[functors]] between [[categories of modules]].

This is the [[Eilenberg-Watts theorem]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the context of [[higher category theory]]/[[higher algebra]] one may interpret this as says that the [[2-category]] of those [[2-modules]] over the given ring which are equivalent to a [[category of modules]] is that of $R$-algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. See also at _[[2-ring]]_.
