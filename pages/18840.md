## Idea

In [[probability theory]],
the concept of _noncommutative probability space_ or _quantum probability space_ is the generalization of that of _[[probability space]]_ as the concept of "space" is generalized to [[non-commutative geometry]].

The basic idea is to encode a would-be [[probability space]] dually in its [[algebra of functions]] $\mathcal{A}$, typically regarded as a [[star algebra]], and encode the [[probability measure]] as a [[state on a star-algebra|state on this star algebra]] 

$$
  \langle
    (-) 
  \rangle
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{A}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}
  \,.
$$

Hence this primarily [[axiom|axiomatizes]] the concept of _[[expectation values]]_ $\langle A\rangle$ ([Segal 65](#Segal65), [Whittle 92](#Whittle92)) while leaving the nature of the underlying [[probability measure]] implicit (in contrast to the classical formalization of [[probability theory]] by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]).

Often $\mathcal{A}$ is assumed/required to be a [[von Neumann algebra]] (e.g. [Kuperberg 05, section 1.8](#Kuperberg05)). Often $\mathcal{A}$ is taken to be the full algebra of [[bounded operators]] on some [[Hilbert space]] (e.g. [Attal, def. 7.1](#Attal)).

In [[quantum physics]], $\mathcal{A}$ is an [[algebra of observables]] (or a [[local net of observables|local net]] thereof) and $\langle (-)\rangle$ is a particular [[quantum state]], for instance a [[vacuum state]].

The formulation of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] from the algebraic perspective of quantum probability is known as _[[algebraic quantum field theory]]_ ([[AQFT]]).

The formulation of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] from the algebraic perspective of quantum probability is known as _[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_ ([[pAQFT]]).
