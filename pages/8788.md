## Idea

_Geometric quantization via push-forward_  or _$Spin^{\mathbb{C}}$-quantization_ is a variant of _[[geometric quantization]]_ in which the step from a [[prequantum bundle]] to the [[space of states]] is not (explicitly) performed by a choice of [[polarization]] and forming the space of polarized [[sections]], but by a choice of [[spin^c structure]] and forming the [[fiber integration in differential K-theory]] of the prequantum connection. Specifically, this refines the notion of geometric quantization via [[Kähler polarizations]]. 

## Properties
