A **homeomorphism** (also spelt 'homoeomorphism' and 'homœomorphism' but *not* 'homomorphism') is an [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s.

That is, a homeomorphism $f : X \to Y$ is a continuous map of topological spaces such that there is an [[inverse]] $f^{-1}: Y \to X $ that is also a continuous map of topological spaces.  Equivalently, $f$ is a [[bijection]] between the underlying sets such that both $f$ and its inverse are continuous.

Note that a continous bijection is not necessarily a homeomorphism; that is, $Top$ is not a [[balanced category]].

The term 'homeomorphism' is also applied to isomorphisms in categories that generalise $Top$, such as the category of [[convergence space]]s and the category of [[locale]]s.
