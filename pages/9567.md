## Motivation

A series is a formal precursor to a various notions of a sum of an infinite sequence. 


## Definition

An (ordinary) __series__ $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ whose members are the elements $a_n$ in a given additive group is an ordered pair of a [[sequence]] $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ and a sequence $(b_k)_k$ of its partial [[sums]] $b_k = \sum_{n=0}^k a_k$.


## Sum of a series

The most straightforward notion of the **sum** of a series is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of its sequence of partial sums, if this sequence converges, relative to some [[topological space|topology]] on the space where the members of the sequence belong to.  A series that does not converge in this sense is called [[divergent series|divergent]]; sometimes these can also be "summed" by fancier techniques.
