## Motivation

A series is a formal precursor to a various notions of a sum of an infinite sequence. 


## Definition

An (ordinary) __series__ $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ whose members are the elements $a_n$ in a given additive group is an ordered pair of a [[sequence]] $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ and a sequence $(b_k)_k$ of its partial [[sums]] $b_k = \sum_{n=0}^k a_k$.


## Applications: sum of a series

The sum of a series is a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of its sequence of partial sums if this sequence converges (in whatever suitable sense). However, the variants of this notion depends on [[convergence]] properties, the kind of [[topological space|topology]] on the space where the members of the sequence belong to and is often corrected/made precise by resummation, [[renormalization]] and similar devices.
