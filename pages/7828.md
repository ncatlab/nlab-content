## Idea

What is called _KR-theory_ is variant of [[topological K-theory]] on [[spaces]] equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[action]] (hence with an [[involution]]). 

In terms of [[cocycle]] models classes of KR-theory are represented by [[complex vector bundles]] over $X$ on which the involution on their base space lifts to an _anti-linear_ involution of the total space. 

More abstractly, complex conjugation of complex vecgtor bundles induces on the [[complex K-theory]] [[spectrum]] [[KU]] an involutive [[automorphism]]. $KR$-theory is the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology]] theory. 

In particular, the [[homotopy fixed point]] of [[KU]] under this automorphism is [[KO]]

$$
  KO \simeq (KU)^{\mathbb{Z}/2}
$$

and this way where in complex K-theory one has [[KU]]-[[modules]] ([[∞-modules]]), so in KR-theory one has $KO$-modules.
