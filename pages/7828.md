## Idea

What is called _KR-theory_ ([Atiyah 66](#Atiyah66)) is variant of [[topological K-theory]] on [[spaces]] equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[action]] (by [[homeomorphism]], hence equipped with one [[involution|involutive]] homeomorphism -- a "[[real space]]").

In terms of [[cocycle]] models, classes of KR-theory are represented by [[complex vector bundles]] over $X$ on which the involution on their base space lifts to an _anti-linear_ involution of the total space. Over manifolds with trivial involution these are precisely the [[complexification]] of [[real vector bundles]] and hence over such spaces $KR$-theory reduces to [[KO]]-[[cohomology theory|theory]]. Conversely, over two copies $X \cup X$ of $X$ equipped with the involution that interchanges the two, $KR$-theory reduces to [[KU]]-[[cohomology theory|theory]]. Finally over $X \times S^1$ with the involution the antipodal identification on the second ([[circle]]) factor , $KR$-theory reduces to the self-conjugate [[KSC-theory]] ([Anderson 64](#Anderson64)). So in general $KR$-theory interpolates between all these cases. For instance on $X \times S^1$ with the reflection-involution on the circle (the [[real space]] denoted $S^{1,1}$, the non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[representation sphere]]) it behaves like $KO$-theory at the two involution fixed points (the two [[O-planes]]) and like $KU$ in their complement (a model that makes this very explicit is given in [DMR 13, section 4](#DMR13)), schematically:

$$
  KR(S^{1,1}) = ( KO --- KU --- KO )
$$


More abstractly, complex conjugation of complex vector bundles induces on the [[complex K-theory]] [[spectrum]] [[KU]] an involutive [[automorphism]]. $KR$ is the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant spectrum]], and $KR$-theory the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology]] theory.  In particular, the [[homotopy fixed point]] of [[KU]] under this automorphism is [[KO]]

$$
  KO \simeq (KU)^{\mathbb{Z}/2}
$$

(e.g.[Karoubi 01](#Karoubi01), [Dugger 03, corollary 7.6](#Dugger03), [Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, section 7.3](#HillHopkinsRavenel)) and this way where in complex K-theory one has [[KU]]-[[modules]] ([[∞-modules]]), so in KR-theory one has $KO$-modules.

KR is an example of a [[real-oriented cohomology theory]], together with for instance [[MR-theory]] and [[BPR-theory]].

###### Remark on terminology

An [[involution]] on a space by a [[homeomorphism]] (or [[diffeomorphism]]) as they appear in KR theory may be thought of as a "non-linear [[real structure]]", and therefore spaces equipped with such involutions are called "[[real spaces]]". Following this, $KR$-theory is usually pronounced "real K-theory". But **beware** that this terminology easily conflicts with or is confused with [[KO]]-theory. For disambiguation the latter might better be called "orthogonal K-theory". But on abstract grounds maybe $KR$-theory would best be just called $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant complex K-theory.

## Definition

### As the Grothendieck group of complex vector bundles with real structure

...([Atiyah 66](#Atiyah66))...

### As a genuine $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Spectrum

The following gives $KR$ as a [[genuine G-spectrum]] for $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$.

Using that every orthogonal representation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is contained in an $\mathbb{C}^n$ with its [[complex conjugation]] action, one can restrict attention to these. Write 

$$
  \mathbb{C}P^1 = S^{2,1} = S^{\mathbb{C}}
  \,.
$$

The reduced [[canonical line bundle]] over this (the [[Hopf fibration]]) is classified by a map

$$
  S^{2,1}= \mathbb{C}P^1 \to \mathbb{Z}\times BU
$$

to the [[classifying space]] for [[topological K-theory]]. The homotopy-associative  multiplication on this space then yields the structure map of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-spectrum

$$
  S^{2,1} \wedge (\mathbb{Z} \times BU)\to \mathbb{Z}\times BU
  \,.
$$

This is in fact an [[Omega spectrum]], by equivariant complex [[Bott periodicity]] (for instance in [Dugger 03, p. 2-3](#Dugger03)).



## Properties

### Bigrading

As any genuine [[equivariant cohomology theory]] $KR$-theory is naturally graded over the [[representation ring]] $RO(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Write $\mathbb{R}$ for the trivial 1-dimensional representation and $\mathbb{R}_-$ for that given by the sign involution. Then the general orthogonalrepresentation decomposes as a [[direct sum]]

$$
  V = \mathbb{R}^+\oplus \mathbb{R}_-^q
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[representation sphere]] is

$$
  S^V = (some\; convention)
  \,.
$$

### As induced from the derived moduli stack of tori
 {#InducedFromModuliStackOfTori}

The relation between $KU$, $KO$ and $KR$ naturally arises in [[chromatic homotopy theory]] as follows.

Inside the [[moduli stack of formal group laws]] sits the _[[moduli stack of tori|moduli stack of one dimensional tori]]_ $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{G}_m}$ ([Lawson-Naumann 12, def. A.1, A.3](#LawsonNaumann12)). This is equivalent to the [[quotient stack]] of the point by the [[group of order 2]]

$$
  \mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{G}_m}\simeq \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
$$

([Lawson-Naumann 12, prop. A.4](#LawsonNaumann12)). Here the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action is the inversion involution on [[abelian groups]].

Using the [[Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theorem]] this stack carries an [[E-∞ ring]]-valued [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}^{top}$ ([Lawson-Naumann 12, theorem A.5](#LawsonNaumann12)); and by the above equivalence this is a single [[E-∞ ring]] equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[∞-action]]. This is [[KU]] with its involution induced by [[complex conjugation]], hence essentially is $KR$. 

Accordingly, the [[global sections]] of $\mathcal{O}^{top}$ over $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{G}_m}$ are the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[homotopy fixed points]] of this action, hence is $KO$. This is further amplified in ([Mathew 13, section 3](#Mathew13)) and ([Mathew, section 2](#Mathew)).

As suggested there and by the main ([Lawson-Naumann 12, theorem 1.2](#LawsonNaumann12)) this realizes (at least localized at $p = 2$) the inclusion $KO \to KU$ as the restriction of an analogous inclusion of [[tmf]] built as the global sections of the similarly derived [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]].
