## Idea

By a *hyperplane* one usually means an affine or [[linear subspace]] of an [[affine space]] or [[linear space]], respectively, typically required to be a [[positive number|positive]] [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] and [[codimension]] and often required to have [[codimension]]  = 1.

## Examples

In the archetypical example the ambient space is the time-honored [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]/[[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a hyperplane of [[codimension]] 1 is an ordinary [[plane]].


More sophisticated examples arise for instance in the discussion of [[configuration spaces of points]] in a [[Cartesian space]] $E = \mathbb{R}^d$, where hyperplanes in $E^n$ given by $\big\{ (\vec x_1, \cdots, \vec x_n) \,\in\, E^n \;\big\vert\; \vec x_i = \vec x_j \big\}$ reflect the subspaces where positions of a given [[pair]] of points coincide. This leads to discussion of [[arrangements of hyperplanes]] and their [[complements]], see also at *[[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation]]* the references on *[twisted cohomology of configuration spaces of points](Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov+equation#BraidRepresentationsViaTwisteddRCohomologyOfConfigurationSpaces)*.
