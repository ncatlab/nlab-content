A **cartesian object** in a [[2-category]] with [[2-limit|finite limits]] is an object $A$ such that the [[diagonal morphism]] $A\to A\times A$ and the unique map $A\to 1$ have [[right adjoints]].  Any cartesian object is automatically a [[pseudomonoid]] in a canonical way.

For example, a cartesian object in [[Cat]] is precisely a category with finite [[products]], which is of course a [[monoidal category]] in a canonical way.
