## Idea

The **Beck--Chevalley condition**, also sometimes called just the *Beck condition* or the *Chevalley condition*, is a "commutation of [[adjoint functor|adjoint]]s" property that holds in many "[[base change|change of base]]" situations.


## Definition

Suppose given a [[commutative square]] (up to [[isomorphism]]) of [[functor]]s:
$$\array{ & \overset{f^*}{\to} & \\
  ^{g^*}\downarrow && \downarrow^{k^*}\\
  & \underset{h^*}{\to} & }$$
in which $f^*$ and $h^*$ have [[left adjoint]]s $f_!$ and $h_!$, respectively.  Then the [[natural isomorphism]] that makes the square commute has a [[mate]]
$$ h_! k^* \to g^* f_! $$
defined as the composite
$$ h_! k^* \overset{\eta}{\to} h_! k^* f^* f_! \overset{\cong}{\to} h_! h^* g^* f_! \overset{\epsilon}{\to} g^* f_! .$$

We say the original square satisfies the **Beck--Chevalley condition** if this mate is an [[isomorphism]].

More generally, it is clear that for this to make sense, we only need a transformation $k^* f^* \to h^* g^*$; it doesn't need to be an isomorphism.  We also use the term *Beck--Chevalley condition* in this case,


### Left and right Beck--Chevalley condition

Of course, if $g^*$ and $k^*$ also have [[left adjoint]]s, there is also a Beck--Chevalley condition stating that the corresponding mate $k_! h^* \to f^* g_!$ is an isomorphism, and this is not equivalent in general.  Context is usually sufficient to disambiguate, although some people speak of the "left" and "right" Beck--Chevalley conditions.

Note that if $k^* f^* \to h^* g^*$ is not an isomorphism, then there is only one possible Beck-Chevalley condition.


### Dual Beck--Chevalley condition

If $f^*$ and $h^*$ have *right* adjoints $f_*$ and $h_*$, there is also a dual Beck--Chevalley condition saying that the mate $g^* f_* \to h_* k^*$ is an isomorphism.  By general nonsense, if $f^*$ and $h^*$ have right adjoints and $g^*$ and $k^*$ have left adjoints, then $g^* f_* \to h_* k^*$ is an isomorphism if and only if $k_! h^* \to f^* g_!$ is.

### "Local" Beck--Chevalley condition {#Local}

Suppose that $f^*$ and $h^*$ do not have entire left adjoints, but that for a particular object $x$ the left adjoint $f_!(x)$ exists.  This means that we have an object "$f_! x$" and a morphism $\eta_x\colon x \to f^* f_! x$ which is initial in the [[comma category]] $(x / f^*)$.  Then we have $k^*(\eta) \colon k^* x \to k^* f^* f_! x \to h^* g^* f_! x$, and we say that the square satisfies the *local Beck-Chevalley condition at $x$* if $k^*(\eta)$ is initial in the comma category $(k^* x / h^*)$, and hence exhibits $g^* f_! x$ as "$h_! k^* x$" (although we have not asumed that the entire functor $h_!$ exists).

If the functors $f_!$ and $h_!$ do exist, then the square satisfies the (global) Beck-Chevalley condition as defined above if and only if it satisfies the local one defined here at every object.

## Bifibrations

Originally, the condition was introduced by B\'enabou and
Roubaud in 1970 in their classical paper "Monades et Descente" for bifibrations over a base category with pullbacks. In *loc.cit.* they call this condition **Chevalley condition** because he introduced it in his 1964 seminar. 

A bifibration $\mathbf{X} \to \mathbf{B}$ where $\mathbf{B}$ has pullbacks satisfies the **Chevalley condition** iff for every commuting square
$$\array{ & \overset{\psi^\prime}{\rightarrow} & \\
  \downarrow^{\varphi^\prime} && \downarrow^{\varphi}\\
  & \underset{\psi}{\rightarrow} & }$$
in $\mathbf{X}$ over a pullback square in the base $\mathbf{B}$ where $\varphi$ is cartesian and $\psi$ is cocartesian it holds that $\varphi^\prime$ is cartesian
iff $\psi^\prime$ is cocartesian. Actually, it suffices
to postulate one direction because the other one follows.
The nice thing about this formulation is that there is no
mention of "canonical" morphisms and no of cleavages. 

A fibration $P$ has products satisfying the Chevalley condition iff the opposite fibration $P^{op}$ is 
a bifibration satisfying the Chevalley condition in the above sense.

According to the [[Benabou–Roubaud theorem]], the Chevalley condition  is crucial for establishing the connection between the descent in the sense of fibered categories and the [[monadic descent]].

### Examples

* The [[codomain fibration]] of any [[category]] with [[pullbacks]] is a bifibration, and satisfies the Beck--Chevalley condition at every pullback square.

* If $C$ is a [[regular category]] (such as a [[topos]]), the bifibration $Sub(C) \to C$ of [[subobjects]] satisfies the Beck--Chevalley condition at every pullback square.

* The [[family fibration]] $Fam(C)\to Set$ of any category $C$ with small sums satisfies the Beck--Chevalley condition at every pullback square in $Set$.
