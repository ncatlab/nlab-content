# Idea

The **Beck-Chevalley condition**, also sometimes called just the *Beck condition* or the *Chevalley condition*, is a "commutation of adjoints" property that holds in many "change of base" situations.

# Definition

Suppose given a commutative square (up to isomorphism) of functors:
$$\array{ & \overset{f^*}{\to} & \\
  ^{g^*}\downarrow && \downarrow^{k^*}\\
  & \underset{h^*}{\to} & }$$
in which $f^*$ and $h^*$ have left adjoints $f_!$ and $h_!$, respectively.  Then the isomorphism that makes the square commute has a [[mate]]
$$ h_! k^* \to g^* f_! $$
defined as the composite
$$ h_! k^* \overset{\eta}{\to} h_! k^* f^* f_! \overset{\cong}{\to} h_! h^* g^* f_! \overset{\epsilon}{\to} g^* f_! .$$
We say the original square satisfies the **Beck-Chevalley condition** if this mate is an isomorphism.

Of course, if $g^*$ and $k^*$ also have left adjoints, there is also a Beck-Chevalley condition stating that the corresponding mate $k_! h^* \to f^* g_!$ is an isomorphism, and this is not equivalent in general.  Context is usually sufficient to disambiguate, although some people speak of the "left" and "right" Beck-Chevalley conditions.

A common situation in which this occurs is when we have a [[bifibration]], with the functors $f^*$, $g^*$, etc. being the "pullback" functors coming from the cartesian liftings of a commutative square
$$\array{ & \overset{f}{\leftarrow} & \\
  ^g\uparrow && \uparrow^k\\
  & \underset{h}{\leftarrow} & }$$
in the base category.  In this case one also says that this commutative square "downstairs" has the Beck-Chevalley property.  Frequently this property holds for all [[pullback]] squares in the base category; note that since the transpose of a pullback square is a pullback square, there is no left/right ambiguity.

Returning to the general situation, if $f^*$ and $h^*$ have *right* adjoints $f_*$ and $h_*$, there is also a dual Beck-Chevalley condition saying that the mate $g^* f_* \to h_* k^*$ is an isomorphism.  By general nonsense, if $f^*$ and $h^*$ have right adjoints and $g^*$ and $k^*$ have left adjoints, then $g^* f_* \to h_* k^*$ is an isomorphism if and only if $k_! h^* \to f^* g_!$ is.

# Examples

* The [[codomain fibration]] of any category with [[pullbacks]] satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition at every pullback square.

* The [[family fibration]] $Fam(C)\to Set$ of any category $C$ satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition at every pullback square in $Set$.

* If $C$ is a [[regular category]] (such as a [[topos]]), the bifibration $Sub(C) \to C$ of [[subobjects]] satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition at every pullback square.
