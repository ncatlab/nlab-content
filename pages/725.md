## Definition

If $x$ and $y$ are elements of a [[partial order|poset]], then their **meet**, or **infimum**, is an element $x \wedge y$ of the poset such that:
* $x \wedge y \leq x$ and $x \wedge y \leq y$;
* if $a \leq x$ and $a \leq y$, then $a \leq x \wedge y$.
Such a meet may not exist; if it does, then it is unique.

In a [[preorder|proset]], a meet may be defined similarly, but it need not be unique.  (However, it is still unique up the natural [[equivalence]] in the proset.)

The above definition is for the meet of two elements of a poset, but it can easily be generalised to any number of elements.  It may be more common to use 'meet' for a meet of finitely many elements and 'infimum' for a meet of (possibly) infinitely many elements, but they are the same concept.  The meet may also be called the **minimum** if it equals one of the original elements.

A poset that has all finite meets is a **meet-[[semilattice]]**.  A poset that has all infima is an **[[inflattice]]**.

A meet of [[subset]]s or [[subobject]]s is called an [[intersection]].


## Special cases

A meet of zero elements is a [[top]] element.  

Any element $a$ is a meet of that one element.


## Properties

As a poset is a special kind of [[category]], a meet is simply a [[product]] in that category.
