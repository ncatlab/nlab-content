[[!redirects primary homotopy operations]]
The primary homotopy operations are generated by

* the [[Whitehead product]]s;

and

* the [[composition operation]]s.

The primary homotopy operations encoded via [[Pi-algebras]] into an algebraic structure akin to models for a [[Lawvere theory]].  (This is discussed more fully in the entry on [[Pi-algebras]].)
