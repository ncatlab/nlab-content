## Idea

A _[[manifold]]_ is usually by default assumed to have an underlying [[topological space]] which is a [[Hausdorff topological space]]. If that condition is explicitly dropped, one accordingly speaks of a _non-Hausdorff manifold_.  Compare the [[red herring principle]].


## Properties

Assuming that we\'re talking about [[topological manifolds]], a non-Hausdorff manifold is still [[T-1 space|T-1]] and [[sober space|sober]].


## Examples

The usual example is the [[real line]] with the point $0$ 'doubled'.  Explicitly, this is a [[quotient space]] of $\mathbb{R} \times \{a,b\}$ (given the [[product topology]] and with $\{a,b\}$ given the [[discrete topology]]) by the [[equivalence relation]] generated by identifying $(x,a)$ with $(y,b)$ iff $x = y \ne 0$.
