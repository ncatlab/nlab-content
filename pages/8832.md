## Idea

It may superficially seem that every [[locally Euclidean space]] is a [[Hausdorff topological space]], since [[Euclidean space]] is. While the analogous conclusion is in fact true for genuine "local" properties of Euclidean space (such as the $T_1$-[[separation axiom]], [[sober topological space|sobriety]] and [[locally compact topological space|local compactness]], see [this prop.](topological+manifold#LocalPropertiesOfLocallyEuclideanSpace)), it is actually wrong for the "non-local" $T_2$= Hausdorff-conditon: There are [[locally Euclidean spaces]] which are not [[Hausdorff topological spaces]], such as the [[line with two origins]].

Since a ([[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]/[[sigma-compact]]) [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] [[locally Euclidean space]] is called a _[[topological manifold]]_, (paracompact/sigma-compact) non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean spaces are sometimes referred to as "non-Hausdorff manifolds" (an instance of the [[red herring principle]]).



## Examples

The usual example is the [[line with two origins]]: the [[real line]] with the point $0$ 'doubled'.  Explicitly, this is a [[quotient space]] of $\mathbb{R} \times \{a,b\}$ (given the [[product topology]] and with $\{a,b\}$ given the [[discrete topology]]) by the [[equivalence relation]] generated by identifying $(x,a)$ with $(y,b)$ iff $x = y \ne 0$.
