## Idea

The Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a [[finite group]] $G$ is the analogue of the [[representation ring]] in the category of [[finite sets]], as opposed to the category of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] over a field $F$.

Elements of the Burnside ring are thus formal differences of [[G-sets]] (with respect to [[disjoint union]]).

$A$ is a contravariant functor $\text{FinGrp} \xrightarrow{A} \text{AbRing}$.

## Properties

### In equivariant homotopy theory

It turns out that the Burnside ring is isomorphic to the [[colimit]]

$$
  A(G) \simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_V [S^V,S^V]_G
$$

over $G$-[[representations]] in a complete [[G-universe]], of $G$-[[homotopy classes]] of $G$-equivariant based [[continuous functions]] from the [[representation sphere]] $S^V$ to itself.
