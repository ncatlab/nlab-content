[[!redirects burnside ring]]
The Burnside ring is the analogue of the [[representation ring]] in the category of finite sets, as opposed to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a field $F$.

Elements of the Burnside ring are thus formal differences of $G$-sets (with respect to [[disjoint union]]).
