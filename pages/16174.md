The Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a [[finite group]] $G$ is the analogue of the [[representation ring]] in the category of [[finite sets]], as opposed to the category of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] over a field $F$.

Elements of the Burnside ring are thus formal differences of [[G-sets]] (with respect to [[disjoint union]]).

$A$ is a contravariant functor $\text{FinGrp} \xrightarrow{A} \text{AbRing}$.
