## Idea

An _integral transform_ on [[functions]] is a [[linear map]] between functions on [[space]]s $X$, $Y$ encoded by a function $K$ on the [[product]] space $X \times Y$ and given by a formula of the type

$$
  (function\;f\;on\;X) \mapsto
  \left(y \mapsto
  \int_{X} f(x) K(x,y) \right)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have some kind of [[integration]] over $X$.

Here $K$ is called the integral **kernel** of the transformation.


Typically the definition of an integral transform on functions involves some delicate technical issues concerning the precise nature of the function space, the [[measure]] with respect to which the integral is defined, etc.

On the other hand, one may understand the general form of an integral transform as the [[decategorification]] of a very natural general abstract construction in [[higher category theory]]: that of [[integral transforms on sheaves]] given by spans of [[base change geometric morphism]]s.

Special cases of such [[categorification|categorified]] integral transforms are discussed at

* [[Fourier-Mukai transform]], [[topological T-duality]]

* [[groupoidification]]

* [[geometric infinity-function theory]].

## Examples

* The simplest example is [[matrix multiplication]], which corresponds to the case where $X$ and $Y$ are [[discrete space]]s.

* Standard examples involving genuine [[functional analysis]] are for instance the [[Fourier transform]] or the [[Laplace transform]].

* Also the [[path integral]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] is supposed to be a class of examples of an integral kernel.

* [[Fourier-Mukai transform]]

* [[Penrose transform]]

## History
 {#History}

In [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], one of the most important results is [[Dmitri Orlov]]'s representability theorem (1997) which states that every fully faithful [[triangulated functor]] between the [[derived categories]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on two [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[projective varieties]] is representable by some "[[integral kernel]]", i.e., a coherent complex on the [[product]].  One would like to remove the "fully faithful" assumption, but this has proved extremely difficult so far.  In the context of [[dg-categories]] the analogous result, discovered by [[Bertrand Toen]] in 2004, does have the clean form one would like it to.  Along with other problems with [[triangulated categories]], this has been one of the motivations for people like [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and [[Goncalo Tabuada]] to start doing [[noncommutative geometry]] with [[pretriangulated dg-categories]] instead of triangulated categories.

On the other hand [[pretriangulated dg-categories]] are known to provide a model for linear [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]].  Using a different model, like [[quasi-categories]], would be more convenient for extending Toen's theorem from (smooth proper) schemes to (smooth proper) [[derived stacks]].  This was done in [Ben-Zvi & Francis & Nadler 08](#BZFN08).  In the followup ([Ben-Zvi & Nadler & Preygel 13](#BZNP13)) the authors have also extended these results to the non-smooth case.
