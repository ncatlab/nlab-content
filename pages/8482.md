An [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category]] in [[∞Grpd]], hence ann [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] between [[(∞,1)-categories]] that happen to be [[∞-groupoids]].

In terms of presentation by [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]] (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_) this is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 

In terms of presentation by [[CW-complexes]] or [[Kan complexes]], it is a [[homotopy equivalence]].
