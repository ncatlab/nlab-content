## Definition

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ between [[regular categories]] is called **regular** if it preserves [[finite limit]]s and the canonical [[cover]]s: [[regular epimorphism]]s.

## Properties

* For $\mathcal{T}$ a [[regular theory]] and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ its [[syntactic category]], regular functors $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}} \to \mathcal{E}$ into some [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ are precisely [[model]]s of the theory in $\mathcal{E}$.

  For $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ equipped with the structure of the [[syntactic site]] (the [[regular coverage]]), this is in turn equivalent to [[geometric morphism]]s $\mathcal{E} \to Sh(\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}})$ into the [[sheaf topos]] over $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ (the [[classifying topos]] for the theory).
