## Idea

In [[topological homotopy theory]], the _fundamental theorem of covering spaces_ says that for a sufficiently well-behaved [[topological space]] $X$, then the [[functor]] which sends a [[covering space]] of $X$ to the [[Set]]-[[action]] ([[permutation representation]]) of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$ on the [[fibers]] of $E$ is an [[equivalence of categories]]. 

This is a basic instance of the general principle of [[Galois theory]]. 

It follows in particular that for [[connected topological space|connected]] $X$ then the [[automorphism group]] of the [[universal covering space]] of $X$ coincides with the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$ itself (for any baspoint $x$). This often yields a convient means to determine the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ in the first place.


## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem #FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}
###### Theorem
**(fundamental theorem of covering spaces)**

Let $B$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply-connected space|semi-locally simply-connected]].

Then the [[category]] $Cov/B$ of [[covering spaces]] over $B$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[category of functors]] $\Pi_1(B) \to Set$ from the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $B$ to [[Set]] ([[permutation representation]]). 

This equivalence is exhibited by the [[functor]]

$$
  Fiber  
    \;\colon\; 
  Cov/B \longrightarrow Set^{\Pi_1(B)}
$$ 

sending a covering space $p: E \to B$ to the functor which maps the object $b \in \Pi_1(B)$ to the fiber $E_b = p^{-1}(b)$. Given a map $[\phi]: b \to c$ in $\Pi_1(B)$, where $\phi$ is a path from $b$ to $c$, the **unique path-lifting lemma** says that for any $e \in E_b$, there exists a unique fill-in $\tilde{\phi}: I \to E$, that is the diagonal arrow making the following diagram commute:

$$\array{
\{0\} & \stackrel{e}{\to} & E\\
i \downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow p \\ 
I & \overset{\phi}{\to} & B
}$$ 

and we define $Fiber([\phi]): E_b \to E_c$ as the map sending $e \in E_b$ to $\tilde{\phi}(1) \in E_c$.

###### Lemma
**(path lifting property)**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be any [[covering space]].  Given 

1. $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ a [[path]] in $X$, 

1. $\hat x_0 \in E$ be a lift of its starting point, hence such that $p(\hat x_0) = \gamma(0)$

then there exists a unique path $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to E$ such that

1. it is a lift of the original path: $p \circ \hat \gamma = \gamma$;

1. it starts at the given lifted point: $\hat \gamma(0) = \hat x_0$.

In other words, every [[commuting diagram]] in [[Top]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

has a unique [[lift]]:

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\hat \gamma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the case that the covering space is trival, hence of the [[Cartesian product]] form 

$$
  pr_1 \;\colon\;  X \times Disc(S) \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[product topological spaces]] 
in this case a lift $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to X \times Disc(S)$ is equivalently a [[pair]] of continuous functions

$$
  pr_1(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to X  \phantom{AAAA} pr_2(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to Disc(S)
  \,,
$$

Now the lifting condition explicitly fixes $pr_1(\hat \gamma) = \gamma$. Moreover, a continuous function into a [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$ is [[locally constant function|locally constant]], and since $[0,1]$ is a [[connected topological space]] this means that $pr_2(\hat \gamma)$ is in fact a [[constant function]] ([this example](connected+space#LocallyConstantFunctionsOnConnectedSpaces)), hence uniquely fixed to be $pr_2(\hat \gamma) = \hat x_0$.

This shows the statement for the case of trivial covering spaces.

Now consider any covering space $p \colon E \to X$. By definition of covering spaces, there exists for every point $x \in X$ a [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ such that the restriction of $E$ to $U_x$ becomes a trivial covering space:

$$
  p^{-1}(U_x) \simeq U_x \times Disc(p^{-1}(x))
  \,.
$$

Consider such a choice 

$$
  \{U_x \subset X\}_{x \in X}
  \,.
$$

This is an [[open cover]] of $X$. Accordingly, the [[pre-images]]

$$
  \left\{
    \gamma^{-1}(U_x)
    \subset 
    [0,1]
  \right\}_{x \in X}
$$

constitute an open cover of the [[topological interval]] $[0,1]$. 

Now $[0,1]$ is a [[sequentially compact topological space|compact]] [[metric space]] and therefore the [[Lebesgue number lemma]] implies that there is a [[positive number]] $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ and cover of $[0,1]$ by [[open intervals]] of the form $(-\epsilon + x , x  + \epsilon) \cap [0,1] \subset [0,1]$ which [[refinement|refines]] this cover. Again since $[0,1]$ is a [[compact topological space]] there is a [[finite set]] of such intervals which covers $[0,1]$. This means that we find a [[finite number]] of points 

$$
  t_0 \lt t_1 \lt \cdots \lt_{n+1} \in [0,1]
$$ 

with $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{n+1} = 1$ such that for all $0 \lt j \leg n$ there is $x_j \in X$ such that the corresponding path segment

$$
  \gamma([t_j, t_{j+1}]) \subset X
$$

is contained in $U_{x_j}$ from above. 

Now assume that $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_j]}$ has been found. Then by the triviality of the covering space over $U_{x_j}$ and the first argument above, there is a unique lift of $\gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ to a continuous function $\hat \gamma|_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ with starting point $\hat \gamma(t_j)$. Since $[0,t_{j+1}]$ is the [[pushout]] $[0,t_j] \underset{\{t_j\}}{\sqcup} [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ ([this example](Top#TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself)), it follows that $\hat \gamma|_{[0,t_j]}$ and $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ uniquely glue to a continuous function $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$ which lifts $\gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$.

By [[induction]] over $j$, this yields the required lift $\hat \gamma$.

Conversely, given any lift, $\hat \gamma$, then its restrictions $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ are uniquely fixed by the above inductive argument. Therefore also the total lift is unique.

###### Proposition
**([[homotopy lifting property]] of [[covering spaces]])**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be a [[covering space]]. Then commuting squares of the form

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} \times \{0,1\} &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\ 
    [0,1] \times \{0,1\}
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] \times [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

have a unique lift in the lower diagram

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is analogous to that of lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}: The [[Lebesgue number lemma]] gives a partition of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ into a finite number of squares such that the image of each under $\gamma$ lands in an open subset over which the covering space trivializes. Then there is [[induction|inductively]] an unique appropriate lift over each of these squares

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**(lifting theorem)**

Let 

1. $p \colon E \to X$ be a [[covering space]];

1. $e \in E$ a point, with $x \coloneqq p(e)$ denoting its image,

1. $Y$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] and [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] [[topological space]];

1. $y \in Y$ a point

1. $f \colom (Y,y) \longrightarrow (X,x)$ a [[continuous function]] such that $f(y) = x$.

Then the following are equivalent:

1. There exists a lift $\hat f$ in the diagram

   $$
     \array{
       && (E,e)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\hat f}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
       \\
       (Y,y) &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (X,x)
     }
   $$

   of [[pointed topological spaces]].

1. The [[image]] of the [[fundamental group]] of $Y$ under $f$ in that of $X$ is contained in the image of the fundamental group of $E$ under $p$:

   $$
     f_\ast(\pi_1(Y,y)) \subset p_\ast( \pi_1(E,e) )
     \,
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The implication $1) \Rightarrow 2)$ is immediate. We need to show that the second statement already implies the first.

Since $Y$ is connected and locally path-connected, it is also a [[path-connected topological space]] (...). Hence for every point $y' \in Y$ there exists a [[path]] $\gamma$ connecting $y$ with $y'$ and hence a path $f \circ \gamma$ connecting $x$ with $f(y')$.  By the path-lifting property (lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting}) this has a unique lift

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{e}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\widehat{f \circ \gamma}}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1]
     &\underset{f \circ \gamma}{\longrightarrow}&
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore

$$
  \hat f(y') \coloneqq \widehat{f \circ \gamma}
$$

if a lift of $f(y')$.

We claim now that this pointwise construction is independent of the choice $\gamma$, and hat as a function of $y'$ it is indeed continuous. This will prove the claim.

Now by the path lifting lemma \ref{CoveringSpacePathLifting} the lift $\widehat{\f \circ \gamma}$ is unique given $f \circ \gamma$, and hence $\hat f(y')$ depends at most on the choice of $\gamma$.

Hence let $\gamma' \colon [0,1] \to Y$ be another path in $$Y that connects $y$ with $y'$. We need to show that then $\widehat{f \circ \gamma'} = \widehat{f \circ \gamma}$.

First observe that if $\gamma'$ is related to $\gamma$ by a [[homotopy]], so that then also $f \circ \gamma'$ is related to $f \circ \gamma$ by a homotopy, then this is the statement of the homotopy lifting property of lemma \ref{CoveringSpacesHomotopyLifting}.

Next write $\bar\gamma'\cdot \gamma$ for the concatenation of the path $\gamma$ with the reverse of the path $\gamma'$, hence a loop in $Y$, so that $f \circ (\bar\gamma'\cdot \gamma)$ is a loop in $X$. The assumption that $f_\ast(\pi_1(Y,y)) \subset p_\ast(\pi_1(E,e))$ means that the path $\widehat{f \circ (\bar \gamma' \cdot \gamma)}$ which lifts this loop to $E$ is itself a loop in $E$.

But this means that the lift of $f \circ ( \gamma' \cdot (\bar\gamma' \cdot \gamma) )$, coincides with that of $f \circ \gamma'$. But $\bar \gamma' \cdot (\gamma' \cdot \gamma)$ is homotopic (via reparameterization) to just $\gamma$. Hence it follows now with the first statement that the lift of $f \circ \gamma'$ indeed coincides with that of $f \circ \gamma$.

This shows that the above prescription for $\hat f$ is well defined. It remains to see that the function $\hat f$ obtained this way is continuous.
