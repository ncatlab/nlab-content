## Idea

In [[topological homotopy theory]], the _fundamental theorem of covering spaces_ says that for a sufficiently well-behaved [[topological space]] $X$, then the [[functor]] which sends a [[covering space]] of $X$ to the [[Set]]-[[action]] ([[permutation representation]]) of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$ on the [[fibers]] of $E$ is an [[equivalence of categories]]. 

This is a basic instance of the general principle of [[Galois theory]]. 

It follows in particular that for [[connected topological space|connected]] $X$ then the [[automorphism group]] of the [[universal covering space]] of $X$ coincides with the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$ itself (for any basepojtn $x$). This often yields a convient means to determine the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ in the first place.


## Statement

###### Theorem
**(fundamental theorem of covering spaces)**

Let $X$ be a [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply-connected topological space]]. Then the operations on 

1. extracting the [[monodromy]] $Fib_{E}$ of a [[covering space]] $E$ over $X$

1. [[reconstructing a covering space from monodromy]] $Rec(\rho)$

constitute an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Cov(X)
    \underoverset
      {\underset{Fib}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{Rec}{\longleftarrow}}
      {}
  Set^{\Pi_1(X)}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given $\rho \in Set^{\Pi_1(X)}$ a [[permutation representation]],
we need to exhibit a [[natural isomorphism]] of permutation representations.

$$
  \eta_{\rho} 
    \;\colon\; 
  \rho \longrightarrow Fib(Rec(\rho))
$$

First consider what the right hand side is like:
By [this def.](reconstruction+of+covering+spaces+from+monodromy#ElementaryReconstructionCoveringSpace) of $Rec$ and [this def.](monodromy#CoveringSpaceMonodromy) of $Fib$ we have for every $x \in X$ an actual equality

$$
  Fib(Rec(\rho))(x) = \rho(x)
  \,.
$$

To similarly understand the value of $Fib(Rec(\rho))$ on morphisms $[\gamma] \in \Pi_1(X)$, let $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ be a representing [[path]] in $X$. We find, by the [[Lebesgue number lemma]] as in the proof of [this lemma](covering space#CoveringSpacePathLifting), a [[finite number]] of paths $\{\gamma_i\}_{i \in \{1,n\}}$ such that 

1. regarded as morphisms $[\gamma_i]$ in $\Pi_1(X)$ they [[composition|compose]] to $[\gamma]$:

   $$
     [\gamma] = [\gamma_n] \circ \cdots \circ [\gamma_2] \circ [\gamma_1]
   $$

1. each $\gamma_i$ factors through an open subset $U_i \subset X$ over which $Rec(\rho)$ trivializes.

Hence by [[functor|functoriality]] of $Fib(Rec(\rho))$ it is sufficient to understand its value on these paths $\gamma_i$. But on these we have again by direct unwinding of the definitions that

$$
  Fib(Rec(\rho))([\gamma_i]) = \rho([\gamma_i])
  \,.
$$

This means that if we take

$$
  \eta_\rho(x) \colon \rho(x) \overset{=}{\longrightarrow} Fib(Rec(\rho))
$$

to be the above identification, then this is a [[natural transformation]] and hence in a particular a natural isomorphism, as required.

Conversely, given $E \in Cov(X)$ a covering space, we need to exhibit a natural isomorphism of covering spaces of the form

$$
  \epsilon_E 
    \;\colon\;
  Rec(Fib(E)) \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

Again by [this def.](reconstruction+of+covering+spaces+from+monodromy#ElementaryReconstructionCoveringSpace) of $Rec$ and [this def.](monodromy#CoveringSpaceMonodromy) of $Fib$  the underlying set of $Rec(Fib(E))$ is actually equal to that of $E$, hence it is sufficient to check that this [[identity function]] on underlying sets is a [[homeomorphism]] of [[topological spaces]].

By the assumption that $X$ is [[locally path-connected topological space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]], it is sufficient to check for $U\subset X$ an open path-connected subset and $x \in X$ a point with the property that $\pi_1(U,x) \to \pi_1(X,x)$ lands is constant on the trivial element, that the open subsets of $E$ of the form $U \times \{\hat x\} \subset p^{-1}(U)$ form a basis for the topology of $Rec(Fib(E))$. But this is the case by definition of $Rec$. 

This proves the equivalence. 

(Notice that the assumption of local path-connectedness and semi-local simply-connectedness of $X$ is used only to guarantee that the functor $Rec$ exists in the first place.)
