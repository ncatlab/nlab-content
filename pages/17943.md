## Idea

In [[topological homotopy theory]], the _fundamental theorem of covering spaces_ says that for a sufficiently well-behaved [[topological space]] $X$, then the [[functor]] which sends a [[covering space]] of $X$ to the [[Set]]-[[action]] ([[permutation representation]]) of the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$ on the [[fibers]] of $E$ is an [[equivalence of categories]]. 

This is a basic instance of the general principle of [[Galois theory]]. 

It follows in particular that for [[connected topological space|connected]] $X$ then the [[automorphism group]] of the [[universal covering space]] of $X$ coincides with the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$ itself (for any baspoint $x$). This often yields a convient means to determine the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ in the first place.


## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem #FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}
###### Theorem
**(fundamental theorem of covering spaces)**

Let $B$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply-connected space|semi-locally simply-connected]].

Then the [[category]] $Cov/B$ of [[covering spaces]] over $B$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[category of functors]] $\Pi_1(B) \to Set$ from the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $B$ to [[Set]] ([[permutation representation]]). 

This equivalence is exhibited by the [[functor]]

$$
  Fiber  
    \;\colon\; 
  Cov/B \longrightarrow Set^{\Pi_1(B)}
$$ 

sending a covering space $p: E \to B$ to the functor which maps the object $b \in \Pi_1(B)$ to the fiber $E_b = p^{-1}(b)$. Given a map $[\phi]: b \to c$ in $\Pi_1(B)$, where $\phi$ is a path from $b$ to $c$, the **unique path-lifting lemma** says that for any $e \in E_b$, there exists a unique fill-in $\tilde{\phi}: I \to E$, that is the diagonal arrow making the following diagram commute:

$$\array{
\{0\} & \stackrel{e}{\to} & E\\
i \downarrow & \nearrow & \downarrow p \\ 
I & \overset{\phi}{\to} & B
}$$ 

and we define $Fiber([\phi]): E_b \to E_c$ as the map sending $e \in E_b$ to $\tilde{\phi}(1) \in E_c$.

###### Lemma
**(path lifting property)**

Let $p \colon E \to X$ be any [[covering space]].  Given 

1. $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to X$ a [[path]] in $X$, 

1. $\hat x_0 \in E$ be a lift of its starting point, hence such that $p(\hat x_0) = \gamma(0)$

then there exists a unique path $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to E$ such that

1. it is a lift of the original path: $p \circ \hat \gamma = \gamma$;

1. it starts at the given lifted point: $\hat \gamma(0) = \hat x_0$.

In other words, every [[commuting diagram]] in [[Top]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

has a unique [[lift]]:

$$
  \array{
    \{0\} &\overset{\hat x_0}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\hat \gamma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    [0,1] &\underset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the case that the covering space is trival, hence of the [[Cartesian product]] form 

$$
  pr_1 \;\colon\;  X \times Disc(S) \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

By the [[universal property]] of the [[product topological spaces]] 
in this case a lift $\hat \gamma \colon [0,1] \to X \times Disc(S)$ is equivalently a [[pair]] of continuous functions

$$
  pr_1(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to X  \phantom{AAAA} pr_2(\hat \gamma) \colon [0,1] \to Disc(S)
  \,,
$$

Now the lifting condition explicitly fixes $pr_1(\hat \gamma) = \gamma$. Moreover, a continuous function into a [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$ is [[locally constant function|locally constant]], and since $[0,1]$ is a [[connected topological space]] this means that $pr_2(\hat \gamma)$ is in fact a [[constant function]] ([this example](connected+space#LocallyConstantFunctionsOnConnectedSpaces)), hence uniquely fixed to be $pr_2(\hat \gamma) = \hat x_0$.

This shows the statement for the case of trivial covering spaces.

Now consider any covering space $p \colon E \to X$. By definition of covering spaces, there exists for every point $x \in X$ a [[open neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset X$ such that the restriction of $E$ to $U_x$ becomes a trivial covering space:

$$
  p^{-1}(U_x) \simeq U_x \times Disc(p^{-1}(x))
  \,.
$$

Consider such a choice 

$$
  \{U_x \subset X\}_{x \in X}
  \,.
$$

This is an [[open cover]] of $X$. Accordingly, the [[pre-images]]

$$
  \left\{
    \gamma^{-1}(U_x)
    \subset 
    [0,1]
  \right\}_{x \in X}
$$

constitute an open cover of the [[topological interval]] $[0,1]$. 

Now $[0,1]$ is a [[sequentially compact topological space|compact]] [[metric space]] and therefore the [[Lebesgue number lemma]] implies that there is a [[positive number]] $\epsilon \in (0,\infty)$ and cover of $[0,1]$ by [[open intervals]] of the form $(-\epsilon + x , x  + \epsilon) \cap [0,1] \subset [0,1]$ which [[refinement|refines]] this cover. Again since $[0,1]$ is a [[compact topological space]] there is a [[finite set]] of such intervals which covers $[0,1]$. This means that we find a [[finite number]] of points 

$$
  t_0 \lt t_1 \lt \cdots \lt_{n+1} \in [0,1]
$$ 

with $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{n+1} = 1$ such that for all $0 \lt j \leg n$ there is $x_j \in X$ such that the corresponding path segment

$$
  \gamma([t_j, t_{j+1}]) \subset X
$$

is contained in $U_{x_j}$ from above. 

Now assume that $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_j]}$ has been found. Then by the triviality of the covering space over $U_{x_j}$ and the first argument above, there is a unique lift of $\gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ to a continuous function $\hat \gamma|_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ with starting point $\hat \gamma(t_j)$. Since $[0,t_{j+1}]$ is the [[pushout]] $[0,t_j] \underset{\{t_j\}}{\sqcup} [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ ([this example](Top#TopologicalnSphereIsPushoutOfBoundaryOfnBallInclusionAlongItself)), it follows that $\hat \gamma|_{[0,t_j]}$ and $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j,t_{j+1}]}$ uniquely glue to a continuous function $\hat \gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$ which lifts $\gamma\vert_{[0,t_{j+1}]}$.

By [[induction]] over $j$, this yields the required lift $\hat \gamma$.

Conversely, given any lift, $\hat \gamma$, then its restrictions $\hat \gamma\vert_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}$ are uniquely fixed by the above inductive argument. Therefore also the total lift is unique.
