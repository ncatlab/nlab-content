#Idea#

The axioms of a _semi-abelian_ category are supposed to capture the properties of the categories of [[group]]s, [[ring]]s, [[algebra]]s as nicely as the axioms of an [[abelian category]] captures the properties of the category of abelian groups and of modules.


#Definition#

A [[category]] $C$ is **semi-abelian** if it

* has a [[zero object]];

* has finite [[coproduct]]s

* is [[exact category|Barr-exact]];

* is [[Bourn-protomodular]].

Equivalently, a [[category]] $C$ is **semi-abelian** if

* it has a [[zero object]];

* it has [[pullback]]s of (split) [[monomorphism]]s;

* it has [[coequalizer]]s of [[kernel pair]]s;

* [[regular epimorphism]]s are stable under [[pullback]];

* [[congruence|equivalence relations]] are effective.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Can someone explain more about why those are equivalent?  How does the second set of axioms imply the existence of finite limits and finite coproducts?

#Remarks#

* In its most general form, the [[Dold-Kan corespondence]] holds for simplicial objects in semi-abelian categories.


#Examples#

* Every [[abelian category]] is semi-abelian.

* The category [[Grp]] of [[groups]] (not just abelian groups) is semi-abelian but not [[abelian category|abelian]].
