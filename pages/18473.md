## Idea

In much of the literature an _embedding_ of one [[category]] into another is a defined to be [[functor]] which is [[injective function|injective]] on the [[set]] of [[morphisms]]. Accordingly a _full embedding_ is then such a functor which is in addition a [[full functor]].

There are various variants of this in use. But this kind of definition does not respect the [[principle of equivalence]] of [[category theory]], in that it is not invariiant under [[equivalence of categories]].

An invariant concept of embedding is that of [[full subcategory]], meaning a [[fully faithful functor]].
