An [[algebraic scheme]] is __locally noetherian__ if it can be covered by a family $U_\alpha$ of open subsets of the form $U_\alpha = Spec R_\alpha$ where $R_\alpha$ are [[noetherian rings]]. A scheme is __noetherian__ if it is locally noetherian and [[quasicompact scheme|quasicompact]].

###### Observation

If $R$ is a commutative noetherian ring, every [[localization]] of the form $R[f^{-1}]$ where $f\in R$ is also  noetherian. If a scheme $X$ is locally noetherian this implies that there is a base of topology of $X$ consisting of spectra of noetherian rings. In particular _every_ affine subscheme in $X$ has a basis of topology of spectra of noetherian rings.

###### Proposition

An affine scheme is a spectrum of a noetherian ring iff it is a locally noetherian scheme.

###### Corollary

Every affine subscheme of a locally noetherian scheme is the spectrum of a noetherian ring. A scheme is noetherian if _and only if_ it has a finite cover by spectra of noetherian rings.
