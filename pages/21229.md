## Idea

The _Walecka model_ (also: _QHD-I model_) is an [[effective field theory]] related to [[chiral perturbation theory]], that describes the residual [[strong nuclear force]] between [[baryons]] and specifically between [[nucleons]], via exchange of [[sigma-mesons]] and [[omega-mesons]], with the [[nucleons]] appearing as explicit [[effective field theory|effective]] [[field (physics)|fields]] (as opposed to emergent [[Skyrmion]] fields), as is more generally the case in [[baryon chiral perturbation theory]]. Some authors use the term _[[quantum hadrodynamics]]_ specifically for the Walecka model of [[nuclear physics]].

The inclusion also of [[pions]] and of [[rho-mesons]] into the Walecka model came to be known as _[[quantum hadrodynamics]]_, specifically _QHD-II_. See there for more.
