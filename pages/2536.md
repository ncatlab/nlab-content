A **Jordan algebra** is a commutative [[nonassociative algebra]] $J$ satisfying the __Jordan identity__ $(x y) (x x) = x (y (x x))$ for all $x,y$ in $J$.

If $k$ is a [[field]] whose [[characteristic]] is not $2$ (or is any [[commutative ring]] in which $2$ is invertible), then to any [[associative algebra|associative]] $k$-algebra $A$ with product $\cdot$, one associates a Jordan $k$-algebra with the same underlying vector space and whose Jordan product $\circ$ is given by

$$x\circ y \stackrel{def}{=} \frac{x\cdot y + y \cdot x}{2}.$$ 

Such Jordan algebras are called __special__ Jordan algebras; all others are called __exceptional__.

Among the exceptional Jordan algebras over the [[real numbers]], there is a remarkable $27$-dimensional example: the **Albert algebra** $\mathbb{Al}$ of [[self-adjoint matrix|self-adjoint]] $3\times 3$ [[matrix|matrices]] over the [[octonion|octonions]] with the same formula as above for the product in terms of matrix product. Notice that the octonions and their matrices do *not* form associative algebras, but only [[alternative algebras]], so the Jordan identity for the Albert algebra is not automatic (it does not hold for all alternative algebras) but is a consequence of more special circumstances.

## Formally real Jordan algebras ##

Jordan algebras had their origin in the study of the foundations of quantum theory.  In 1932, Pascual Jordan tried to isolate some axioms that an 'algebra of observables' should satisfy:

*  P. Jordan, &Uuml;ber eine Klasse nichtassociativer
hyperkomplexer Algebren, _Nachr. Ges. Wiss. G&ouml;ttingen
(1932), 569--575.

The unadorned phrase 'algebra' usually signals an associative algebra, but this not the kind of algebra Jordan was led to.  In both classical and quantum
mechanics, observables are closed under addition and multiplication by real scalars.  In classical mechanics we can also multiply observables, but in quantum mechanics this becomes problematic.  After
all, given two bounded self-adjoint operators on a complex Hilbert space, their product is self-adjoint if and only if they commute.

However, in quantum mechanics one can still raise an observable to a power and obtain another observable.  From squaring and taking real linear combinations, one can construct a commutative product:
$$    x \circ y = {1\over 2}((x+y)^2 - x^2 - y^2)
                  = {1\over 2}(x y + y x) . $$
This product is not associative, but it is **power-associative**: any way of parenthesizing a product of copies of the same observable $x$ gives the same result.  This led Jordan to define what is now called a **formally real Jordan algebra**: a commutative and power-associative algebra $J$ satisfying
$$  x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 = 0 \quad \implies \quad x_1 = \cdots = x_n = 0  $$
for all $n$.  The last condition gives $J$ a partial ordering: if we write $x \le y$ when the element $y - x$ is a sum of squares, it says that 
$$x \le y \textrm{\; and \;} y \le x \;\;\implies\;\; x = y\,.
So, in a formally real Jordan algebra we can reasonably talk about one observable being 'greater' than another.

In fact the Jordan identity $(x y) (x x) = x (y (x x)) $
is a _consequence_ of the above definition of formally real Jordan algebra.  So, every formally real Jordan algebra is a Jordan algebra (but not conversely).

In 1934, Jordan published a paper with von Neumann and Wigner classifying finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebras:

* P. Jordan, J. von Neumann and E. Wigner, On an algebraic generalization of the quantum mechanical formalism, _Ann. Math._ **35** (1934), 29--64.

They began by defining an **ideal** of a formally real
Jordan algebra $J$ to be a linear subspace $S \subseteq J$ such that $x \in S$ implies $x \circ y \in S$ for all $y \in J$.  Next they defined $J$ to be **simple** when its only ideals were $\{0\}$ and $J$ itself.  Then they proved that any finite-dimensional formally Jordan algebra
is a direct sum of simple ones.

This reduced the classification problem to the task of classifying _simple_ finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebras.  There are four families of these, and one exception:

* The $n \times n$ self-adjoint real matrices
with the product $a \circ b = {1\over 2}(a b + b a)$.

* The $n \times n$ self-adjoint complex matrices
with the product $a \circ b = {1\over 2}(a b + b a)$.

* The $n \times n$ self-adjoint quaternionic matrices
with the product $a \circ b = {1\over 2}(a b + b a)$.

* The $n \times n$ self-adjoint octonionic matrices
with the product $a \circ b = {1\over 2}(a b + b a)$, where $n \le 3$. 

* The space $\mathbb{R}^n \oplus \mathbb{R}$ with the product $(v,\alpha) \circ (w, \beta) = (\alpha w + \beta v, \langle v,w\rangle + \alpha \beta).$

Here we say a square matrix with entries in the $\ast$-algebra $A$ is **hermitian** if it equals its conjugate transpose.   (Note that $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ are all $\ast$-algebras.)   

Because the octonions are an [[alternative algebra]] but not associative, we cannot go beyond $3 \times 3$ matrices and still get a Jordan algebra.  The $1 \times 1$ self-adjoint octonionic matrices are just the real numbers, and the $2 \times 2$ ones are isomorphic to the spin factor $\mathbb{R}^9 \oplus \mathbb{R}$.   The $3 \times 3$ self-adjoint octonionic matrices form the Albert algebra.

Jordan algebras in the fifth family are called **spin
factors**.   This family has some overlaps with the others.  Most notably:

* The Jordan algebra of $2 \times 2$ self-adjoint real matrices is isomorphic to the spin factor $\mathbb{R}^2 \oplus \mathbb{R}$.

* The Jordan algebra of $2 \times 2$ self-adjoint complex matrices is isomorphic to the spin factor $\mathbb{R}^3 \oplus \mathbb{R}$.

* The Jordan algebra of $2 \times 2$ self-adjoint quaternionic matrices is isomorphic to the spin factor $\mathbb{R}^5 \oplus \mathbb{R}$.

* The Jordan algebra of $2 \times 2$ self-adjoint octonionic matrices is isomorphic to the spin factor $\mathbb{R}^9 \oplus \mathbb{R}$.

Because the spin factor $\mathbb{R}^n \oplus \mathbb{R}$ can be identified with $(n+1)$-dimensional [[Minkowski space]], this sets up a relation between the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions and Minkowski space in 3,4,6 and 10 dimensions --- a pattern which becomes important in string theory.

In 1983, Zelmanov drastically generalized the result of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner by classifying all simple Jordan algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones:

## Self-dual convex homogeneous cones ##

Every finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebra automatically has an identity element.  This lays the groundwork for an observation Max Koecher made in 1957-58.  Namely: the category of formally real Jordan algebras is equivalent to the category of self-dual convex homogeneous cones in finite-dimensional vector spaces (say $C \subset V$) equipped with a base point $p \in C$.  Here a cone $C \subset V$ is said to be **homogeneous** if it does not contain any straight lines and the group $GL(V)$ acts transitively on $V$.

Starting from a formally real Jordan algebra $J$, we get a self-dual convex homogeneous cone by taking $V = J$ and taking $C = \{x \in J: x \ge 0\}$.  As a basepoint we can take $p = 1$.  

In quantum mechanics, the self-duality of the cone $C$ says that for a finite-dimensional algebra of observables, we can identify nonnegative observables with nonnegative linear functionals on the algebra of observables.  A nonnegative linear functional on the algebra of observables can be considered an 'unnormalized state', since a **state** is defined to be a linear functional 
$$    \mu \maps J \to \mathbb{R} $$
that is nonnegative ($x \ge 0 \implies \mu(x) \ge 0$) and normalized ($\mu(1) = 1$).  In short, Koecher's result sets up a close relation between states and observables for any form of quantum theory based on a finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebra.
