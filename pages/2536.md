A **Jordan algebra** is a commutative [[nonassociative algebra]] $J$ 
satisfying the Jordan identity $(x y) (x x) = x (y (x x))$ for all $x,y$ in $J$.

If $k$ is a [[field]] whose [[characteristic]] is not $2$ (or any [[commutative ring]] in which $2$ is invertible), then to any [[associative algebra|associative]] $k$-algebra $A$ with product $\cdot$, one associates a Jordan $k$-algebra with the same underlying vector space and whose Jordan product $\circ$ is given by

$$x\circ y \stackrel{def}{=} \frac{x\cdot y + y \cdot x}{2}.$$ 

Such Jordan algebras are called __special__ Jordan algebras; all others are called __exceptional__.

Among the exceptional Jordan algebras over the [[real numbers]], there is a remarkable $27$-dimensional example: the **Albert algebra** $\mathbb{Al}$ of self-adjoint $3\times 3$ [[matrix|matrices]] over the [[octonion|octonions]] with the same formula as above for the product in terms of matrix product. Notice that the octonions and their algebras of matrices are *not* associative algebras, but only [[alternative algebras]], so the Jordan identity for the Albert algebra is not automatic (it does not hold for all alternative algebras), but a consequence of more special circumstances.
