A **Jordan algebra** is a commutative [[nonassociative algebra]] $J$ 
satisfying the Jordan identity $(xy)(xx) = x(y(xx))$ for all $x,y$ in $J$.

If $char(k)\neq 0$, to any associative $k$-algebra $A$ with product $\cdot$, one associates a Jordan $k$-algebra with the same underlying vector space and whose Jordan product $\circ$ is given by

$$x\circ y \stackrel{def}{=} \frac{x\cdot y + y \cdot x}{2}.$$ 

Such Jordan algebras are called special Jordan algebras. All others are called exceptional. Among exceptional Jordan algebras there is a remarkable 27-dimensional example: the **Albert algebra** $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{l}$ of self-adjoint $3\times 3$ matrices over octonions with the same formula as above for the product in terms of matrix product. Notice that the octonions are not an associative algebra, but only an [[alternative algebra]], so the Jordan identity for the Albert algebra is not automatic, but a consequence of more special circumstances.
