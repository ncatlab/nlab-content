## Idea

Where the [[projective model structure on connective dgc-algebras]] models the [[rational homotopy theory]] of rationally [[finite type]] [[nilpotent topological spaces]] (by the [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]]), its $G$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] enhancement ([Scull 08](#Scull08)) models $G$-[[equivariant rational homotopy theory]] of [[topological G-spaces]]:

Using [[Elmendorf's theorem]], the underlying [[category]] is that of [[diagrams]] of connective [[dgc-algebras]] parametrized over the [[orbit category]] of $G$. A key technical aspect of this generalization is that not all [[objects]] are [[injective object|injective]] anymore, but otherwise the definitions and properties of the model structure proceed in analogy to [Bousfield-Gugenheim](model+structure+on+dg-algebras#BousfieldGugenheim76)'s [[projective model structure on connective dgc-algebras]]. Notably, the [[minimal cofibrations]] coincide with the equivariant [[minimal Sullivan models]] earlier considered by [Triantafillou 82](#Triantafillou82).
