An __element__ of an object $W$ in a fixed [[abelian category]] $A$ is an [[equivalence class]] $[X,h]$ of pairs $(X,h)$ where $X$ is an object of $A$ and $h:X\to X'$ a morphism (hence a [[generalized element]]) and the equivalence is defined as follows: $[X,h] = [Y,k]$ iff there exists an object $Z$ in $A$ and [[epimorphisms]] $u:Z\to X$, $v:Z\to Y$ such that $h\circ u = k\circ v : Z\to X'$. 

Notice that subtlety in the equivalence relation.

Elements in an abelian category can be used for [[diagram chasing]], see the exercises at the end of chapter II.5 of the following reference:
