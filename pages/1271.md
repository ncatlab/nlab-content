An __element__ of an object $W$ in a fixed [[abelian category]] $A$ is an *equivalence class* $[X,h]$ of pairs $(X,h)$ where $X$ is an object of $A$ and $h:X\to A$ morphism and the equivalence is defined as follows: $[X,h] = [Y,k]$ iff there exists an object $Z$ in $A$ and [[epimorphisms]] $u:Z\to X$, $v:Z\to Y$ such that $h\circ u = k\circ v$. 

Elements in an abelian category can be used for [[diagram chasing]].

An element in an abelian category is an equivalence class of [[generalized elements]].
