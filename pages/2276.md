Given an action $G\times X\to X$ of a [[group]] $G$ on a set $X$, any set of the form $Gx = \{gx|g\in G\}$ for a fixed $x\in X$ is called a __$G$-orbit through point $x$__. Set $X$ is a disjoint union of its orbits. If $G$ is a topological group, $X$ a topological space and the action continuous one can distinguish closed orbits and those which are not. Even when one starts with $G,X$ [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] the space of orbits is typically non-Hausdorff. This problem is one of the motivations of the [[noncommutative geometry]] of Connes' school. 

If the original space is paracompact Hausdorff, every orbit $Gx$ as a topological $G$-space is isomorphic to $G/H$ where $H$ is the stabilizer subgroup of $x$. 

__Orbit method__ is a method in representation theory introduced by Kirillov, Kostant and Souriau and is a special case of the [[geometric quantization]]; it is based on the study of the representations constructed from studying the [[coadjoint orbits]] with Kirillov symplectic structure. The terminology geometric quantization allows for more general underlying spaces.

Given a [[compact space|compact]] [[Lie group]] $K$ with complexification $G$, and a unitary representation $\rho$ of $K$ on a finite-dimensional complex space $V$, the real orbits of the highest weight vector agrees with the complex orbits, i.e. the orbits of the extension of this representation to the representation of the complexification. These are the [[coherent state]] orbits; there is also an infinite-dimensional version for reductive groups and representations which allow them (so-called coherent state representations).
