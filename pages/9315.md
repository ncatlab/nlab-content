## Idea

For $G$ a [[group]] with [[action]] on two [[objects]] $X$ and $Y$, there is a canonically induced action on the [[product]] $X \times Y$. This is the _diagonal action_.

## Definition
For every $g\in G$, $g:X\rightarrow X$, $x\mapsto gx$,  and $g:Y\rightarrow Y$, $y\mapsto gy$ are both automorphisms, and 
the maps $g:X\times Y$, $g(x,y)=(gx, gy)$ define the *diagonal action* of $G$ on $X\times Y$.
