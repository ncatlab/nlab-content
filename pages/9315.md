## Idea

For $G$ a [[group]] with [[action]] on two [[objects]] $X$ and $Y$, there is a canonically induced action on the [[product]] $X \times Y$. This is the _diagonal action_.

## Definition
For every $g\in G$, $g:X\rightarriw X$ $x\mapsto gx$, $g:Y\rightarrow Y$ $y\mapstp gy$ are two automorphisms. 
Then map $g:X\times Y$, $g(x,y)=(gx, gy)$ is defined to be the diagonal action.
