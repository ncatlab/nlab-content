#Unitary operators

A unitary operator $U$ is a bounded linear operator $U: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ that satisfies

$U^{*}U=U U^{*}=I$

where $U^{*}$ is the [[adjoint]] of $U$ and $I$ is the identity operator.  This property is equivalent to saying that the range of $U$ is dense and that $U$ preserves the inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ on the Hilbert space.  An operator is unitary if and only if $U^{-1}=U^{*}$.

Unitary operators are the automorphisms of Hilbert spaces since they preserve the basic structure of the space, e.g. the topology.  The group of all unitary operators from a given Hilbert space to itself is sometimes called the _Hilbert group_ of $H$ and is denoted Hilb($H$).

[[Ian Durham]]: It seems that, given the similarity to the category of [[quantum channels]], these should form a subcategory of $Vect_{\mathbb{C}}$.  Anybody else agree?

Sometimes operators may only obey the _[[isometry]]_ $U^{*}U=I$ or the _[[coisometry]]_ $U U^{*}=I$.

The generalization of a unitary operator is called a _unitary element_ of a [[unital]] [[*-algebra]].

#Unitary matrices

A unitary matrix is an $n \times n$ matrix with complex entries that satisfies the condition

$U^{*}U=U U^{*}=I_{n}$.

This is equivalent to saying that both the rows and the columns of $U$ form an orthonormal basis in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ with respect to the respective inner product.  $U$ is also a [[normal matrix]] whose [[eigenvalue]]s lie on the unit circle.

#Notation

The notation used here for the adjoint, $U^{*}$, is commonly used in linear algebraic circles (as is $U^{H}$).  In [[quantum mechanics]], $U^{\dagger}$ is exclusively used for the adjoint while $U^{*}$ is interpreted as the same thing as $\bar{U}$, i.e. the complex conjugate.
