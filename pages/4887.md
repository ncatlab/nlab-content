## Idea

A method of [[quantization]] of [[mechanical systems]] represented by [[symplectic manifolds]] that produces the [[space of states]] of this system as the space of states of [[open strings]] in the [[A-model]].

More in detail, the [[symplectic manifold]] serves as the [[target space]] for the 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[TQFT]] called the [[A-model]]. If the symplectic manifold arises as the [[complexification]] of a [[phase space]] of some [[physical system]], then one finds that the [[boundary]] [[path integral]] of the A-model on [[coisotropic submanifold|cosiotropic]] [[branes]] computes the path integral and the [[geometric quantization]] of this physical system.

The setup is reminiscent of how the [[deformation quantization]] of the phase space is computed by the 2-dimensional [[Poisson sigma-model]]. See at _[[holographic principle]]_ for more on the general pattern.

> The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of [[quantization]].
