## Idea

A [[symplectic manifold]] serves as the target space for the 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[TQFT]] called the [[A-model]]. If the symplectic manifold arises as the complexification of a [[phase space]] of some physical system, then one finds that the boundary [[path integral]] of the A-model on cosiotropic [[brane]]s computes the path integral and the [[geometric quantization]] of this physical system.

The setup is reminiscent of how the [[deformation quantization]] of the phase space is computed by the 2-dimensional [[Poisson sigma-model]].
