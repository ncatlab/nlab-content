## Idea

Given two [[measures]] $\mu, \nu$ on the same [[measurable space]], their Radon--Nikodym derivative is essentially their ratio $\mu/\nu$, although this is traditionally written $\mathrm{d}\mu/\mathrm{d}\nu$ because of analogies with [[differentiation]].  This ratio or derivative is a [[measurable function]] which is defined up to [[almost equality|equality almost everywhere]] with respect to the divisor $\nu$.  It only exists iff $\mu$ is [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] with respect to $\nu$.

Integration on a general [[measure space]] can be seen as the process of multiplying a measure by a function to get a measure.  Then the Radon--Nikodym derivative is the reverse of this: dividing two measures to get a function.


## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[measurable space]] (so $X$ consists of a [[set]] ${|X|}$ and a $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] $\mathcal{M}_X$), and let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be [[measures]] on $X$, valued in the [[real numbers]] (and possibly taking infinite values) or in the [[complex numbers]] (and taking only finite values).  Let $f$ be a [[measurable function]] $f$ (with real or complex values) on $X$.

###### Definition
The function $f$ is a __Radon--Nikodym derivative__ of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$ if, given any [[measurable subset]] $A$ of $X$, the $\mu$-measure of $A$ equals the integral of $f$ on $A$ with respect to $\nu$:
$$ \mu(A) = \int_A f \nu = \int_{x \in A} f(x) \nu(\mathrm{d}x) .$$
(The latter two expressions in this equation are different notations for the same thing.)

## Properties

These properties are basic to the concept; the notation is as in the definition above.

###### Theorem

Let $f$ be a Radon--Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$, and let $g$ be a measurable function on $X$.  Then $g$ is a Radon--Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are equal almost everywhere with respect to $\nu$.

###### Theorem
If a Radon--Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$ exists, then $\mu$ is [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] with respect to $\nu$.

###### Theorem
If $\mu$ is [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] with respect to $\nu$ and both $\mu$ and $\nu$ are $\sigma$-[[sigma-finite measure|finite]], then a Radon--Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$ exists.

Note the repetition of 'with respect to $\nu$' in various guises; let us fix $\nu$ (assumed to be $\sigma$-finite) and take everything with respect to it.  Then it is convenient to treat all measurable functions up to [[almost equality|equality almost everywhere]]; and given any absolutely continuous $\mu$ (also assumed to be $\sigma$-finite), we speak of [[the]] Radon--Nikodym derivative of $\mu$.


## Notation

See also the discussion of notation at [[measure space]].

Using the simplest notation for integrals, the definition of Radon--Nikodym derivative reads
$$ \mu(A) = \int_A f \nu ,$$
or equivalently
$$ \int_A \mu = \int_A f \nu .$$
In other words, the measure $\mu$ is the product of the function $f$ and the measure $\nu$:
$$ \mu = f \nu ;$$
and so $f$ is the ratio of $\mu$ to $\nu$:
$$ f = \mu/\nu .$$
So this is the simplest notation for the Radon--Nikodym derivative.

However, this notation for integrals is uncommon; one is more likely to see
$$ \int_A \mathrm{d}\mu = \int_A f \,\mathrm{d}\nu ,$$
which leads to
$$ f = \mathrm{d}\mu/\mathrm{d}\nu $$
for the Radon--Nikodym derivative.  But none of these ‘$\mathrm{d}$’s are really necessary.

We can also use a fuller notation with a dummy variable as the object of the symbol ‘$\mathrm{d}$’:
$$ \int_{x \in A} \mu(\mathrm{d}x) = \int_{x \in A} f(x) \,\nu(\mathrm{d}x) ;$$
this leads to
$$ f(x) = \mu(\mathrm{d}x)/\nu(\mathrm{d}x) ,$$
which does not give a symbol for $f$ directly.  If instead of $\mu(\mathrm{d}x)$ one unwisely writes $\mathrm{d}\mu(x)$, then this gives the previous notation for the Radon--Nikodym derivative.

Now let $\nu$ be [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[real line]] and let $F$ be an upper [[semicontinuous function]] on the real line, so that $F$ defines a [[Borel measure]] $\mu$ generated by
$$ \mu({]-\infty,a]}) \coloneqq F(a) .$$
Then $F$ is [[absolutely continuous function|absolutely continuous]] if and only if $\mu$ is absolutely continuous, in which case the [[derivative]] $F'$ exists almost everywhere and is a Radon--Nikodym derivative of $\mu$.  That is,
$$ \mu/\nu = F' = \mathrm{d}F/\mathrm{d}t .$$
The presence of ‘$\mathrm{d}$’ on the right-hand side inspires people to put it on the left-hand side as well; but this is spurious, since we really want to write
$$ \mu = \mathrm{d}F $$
and
$$ \nu = \mathrm{d}t ,$$
where $t$ is the [[identity function]] on the real line.
