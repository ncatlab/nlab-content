## Idea

The _Quillen model structure on topological spaces_ $Top_{Quillen}$ is a [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] (also on many [[convenient categories of topological spaces]]) which represents the standard classical [[homotopy theory]]. 

Its [[weak equivalences]] are the [[weak homotopy equivalences]], its [[fibrations]] are the [[Serre fibrations]] and its [[cofibrations]] are the [[retracts]] of [[relative cell complexes]].

The [[singular simplicial complex]]/[[geometric realization]] [[nerve and realization|adjunction]] constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] between 
$Top_{Quillen}$ and $sSet_{Quillen}$, the [[Quillen model structure on simplicial sets]]. This is sometimes called part of the statement of the _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_ [for Kan complexes](homotopy+hypothesis#ForKanComplexes). In the language of [[(∞,1)-category theory]] this means that $Top_{Quillen}$ and $sSet_{Quillen}$ both are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentations]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]] of [[∞-groupoids]].

There are also other model structures on [[Top]] itself, see at _[[model structure on topological spaces]]_ for more. This entry here focuses on just the standard Quillen model structure.

## Motivation

The fundamental concept of [[homotopy theory]] is that of _[[homotopy]]_. Recall the definition of [[left homotopy]] and [[right homotopy]] between [[continuous functions]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInterval}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  I \coloneqq [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

for the standard topological [[interval]], a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #CompactOpenTopology}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **[[mapping space]]**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]] 

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous functions]] $Y \to X$, 

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[finitary intersections]] of [[unions]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U_{K,U} \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for 

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

  is the subset of [[continuous functions]] $f$ of all those  that fit into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

  $$
    \array{
       K &\hookrightarrow& Y
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       U &\hookrightarrow& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **[[mapping space]]** $X^Y$ from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} is an [[exponential object]]: there is a [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(Z \times Y, X) \simeq Hom_{Top}(Z, X^Y)
$$ 

between continuous functions out of any [[product topological space]] of $Y$ with any $Z \in Top$ and continuous functions from $Z$ into the mapping space.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} fails if $Y$ is not locally compact and Hausdorff. Therefore the plain category [[Top]] of all topological spaces is not a [[Cartesian closed category]]. 

This is no problem for the construction of the homotopy theory of topological spaces as such, but it becomes a technical nuisance when comparing it for instance to the [[simplicial homotopy theory]] via the singular [[nerve and realization]] adjunction, since it implies that [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] does not necessarily preserve [[finite limits]].

On the other hand, without changing any of the following discussion one may just pass to a more [[convenient category of topological spaces]] such as notably the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_{ck} \hookrightarrow Top$ which is [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]].
