## Idea

The _Quillen model structure on topological spaces_ $Top_{Quillen}$ is a [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] (also on many [[convenient categories of topological spaces]]) which represents the standard classical [[homotopy theory]]. 

Its [[weak equivalences]] are the [[weak homotopy equivalences]], its [[fibrations]] are the [[Serre fibrations]] and its [[cofibrations]] are the [[retracts]] of [[relative cell complexes]].

The [[singular simplicial complex]]/[[geometric realization]] [[nerve and realization|adjunction]] constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] between 
$Top_{Quillen}$ and $sSet_{Quillen}$, the [[Quillen model structure on simplicial sets]]. This is sometimes called part of the statement of the _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_ [for Kan complexes](homotopy+hypothesis#ForKanComplexes). In the language of [[(∞,1)-category theory]] this means that $Top_{Quillen}$ and $sSet_{Quillen}$ both are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentations]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]] of [[∞-groupoids]].

There are also other model structures on [[Top]] itself, see at _[[model structure on topological spaces]]_ for more. This entry here focuses on just the standard Quillen model structure.

## Background from algebraic topology

This section recalls basic relevant concept from [[algebraic topology]] and highlights some basic facts that may serve to motivate the Quillen model structure.

### Homotopy

The fundamental concept of [[homotopy theory]] is that of _[[homotopy]]_. This is about contiunous deformations of [[continuous functions]] parameterized by the standard interval:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInterval}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  I \coloneqq [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

for the standard topological [[interval]], a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]].

Equipped with the canonical inclusion of its two endpoints

$$
  \ast \sqcup \ast \stackrel{(\delta_0,\delta_1)}{\longrightarrow} I \stackrel{\exists !}{\longrightarrow} \ast
$$

this is the standard [[interval object]] in [[Top]].

For $X \in Top$, the [[product topological space]] $X\times I$
is called the standard _[[cylinder object]]_ over $X$.
The endpoint inclusions of the interval make it factor the [[codiagonal]] on $X$

$$
  \nabla_X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{((id,\delta_0),(id,\delta_1))}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times I
  \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

=--



+-- {: .num_defn #LeftHomotopy}
###### Definition

For $f,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ two [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, then a **[[left homotopy]]** $f \Rightarrow_L g$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times I \longrightarrow Y
$$

out of the [[product topological space]] of $X$ with the standard interval of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, such that this fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow
     \\
     X \times I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

The key application of the concept of left homotopy is to the definition of [[homotopy groups]].

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then its set $\pi_0(X)$
of _[[connected components]]_, also called the **0-th homotopy set**, 
is the set of 
[[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of points $\ast \to X$,
def.\ref{LeftHomotopy}. By [[composition]] this extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \pi_0 \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

For $n \in \mathb{N}$, $n \geq 1$ and for $x \colon \ast \to X$
any point, then the $n$th **[[homotopy group]]** $\pi_n(X)$ of $X$ at $x$
is the [[group]] 

* whose underlying [[set]] is the set of [[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of maps $I^n \longrightarrow X$ that take the [[boundary]] of $I^n$ to $x$ and where the left homotopies $\eta$ are constrained to be constant on the boundary;

* whose [[group]] product operation takes $[\alpha \colon I^n \to X]$ and $[\beta \colon I^n \to X]$ to $[\alpha \cdot \beta]$ with

$$
  \alpha \cdot \beta
  \;\colon\;
  I^n 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  I^n \underset{I^{n-1}}{\coprod} I^n
  \stackrel{(\alpha,\beta)}{\longrightarrow}
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is any [[homeomorphism]] from the unit $n$-[[cube]] to the $n$-cube with one side twice the unit length.

By [[composition]], this construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \geq 1}
    \;\colon\; 
  Top^{\ast/}
   \longrightarrow 
  Grp^{\mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}}
$$

from [[pointed topological spaces]] to [[graded object|graded]] [[group]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$
is called  a **[[weak homotopy equivalence]]** if its image
under all the [[homotopy group]] functors of def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
is an [[isomorphism]], hence if 

$$
  \pi_0(f) \;\colon\; \pi_0(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_0(X)
$$

and for all $x \in X$ and all $n \geq 1$

$$
  \pi_n(f) \;\colon\; \pi_n(X,x) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_n(Y,f(y))
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_example #FactoringTopologicalCodiagonalThroughCylinder}
###### Example

For $X\in Top$, the projection $X\times I \longrightarrow X$
from the [[cylinder object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval},
is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}. 

This means that the factorization 

$$
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  X\times I
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
$$

of the [[codiagonal]] $\nabla_X$ in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, which in general is far from being a [[monomorphism]], may be thought of as factoring it through a monomorphism after replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by $X\times I$.

In fact $X \sqcup X \to X \times I$ has better properties than the generic monomorphism has, in particular better homotopy invariant properties:
it has the [[left lifting property]] against all [[Serre fibrations]] $ E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} B$ (def. \ref{SerreFibration}) that are also [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

=--


For $Y$ a [[topological space]], the set $Hom_{Top}(I,Y)$ of continuous functions from the standard interval $I$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, to $Y$ is the set of continuous paths in $X$. Every such path may be though of as a [[left homotopy]] between its endpoints. Hence a function $X \longrightarrow Hom_{Top}(I,Y)$ is an $X$-parameterized collection of such paths. In order for that to also give a concept of homotopy, we need to impose a continuity condition on how the paths may vary, hence we need to put a suitable [[topological space|topology]] on $Hom_{Top}(I,X)$. This is the [[compact-open topology]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #CompactOpenTopology}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **[[mapping space]]**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]] 

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous 
functions]] $Y \to X$, 

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[finitary intersections]] of [[unions]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U_{K,U} \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for 

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

  is the subset of [[continuous functions]] $f$ of all those  that fit into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

  $$
    \array{
       K &\hookrightarrow& Y
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       U &\hookrightarrow& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

Accordingly this is called the _[[compact-open topology]]_ on the set of functions.

The construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  (-)^{(-)} \;\colon\; Top_{lcH}^{op} \times Top \longrightarrow Top
  \,.
$$

=--
 
+-- {: .num_prop #MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **topological [[mapping space]]** $X^Y$ from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} is an [[exponential object]]: there is a [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(Z \times Y, X) \simeq Hom_{Top}(Z, X^Y)
$$ 

between continuous functions out of any [[product topological space]] of $Y$ with any $Z \in Top$ and continuous functions from $Z$ into the mapping space.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} fails if $Y$ is not locally compact and Hausdorff. Therefore the plain category [[Top]] of all topological spaces is not a [[Cartesian closed category]]. 

This is no problem for the construction of the homotopy theory of topological spaces as such, but it becomes a technical nuisance when comparing it for instance to the [[simplicial homotopy theory]] via the singular [[nerve and realization]] adjunction, since it implies that [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] does not necessarily preserve [[finite limits]].

On the other hand, without changing any of the following discussion one may just pass to a more [[convenient category of topological spaces]] such as notably the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_{ck} \hookrightarrow Top$ which is [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalPathSpace}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its **[[path space object]]** is the topological [[mapping space]] $X^I$, def. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}, out of the standard interval $I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}.


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The endpoint inclusion into the standard interval, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, makes the path space $X^I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} factor the [[diagonal]] on $X$ through the inclusion of constant paths and the endpoint evaluation of paths:


$$
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\; 
  X \stackrel{X^{I \to \ast}}{\longrightarrow} X^I \stackrel{X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.
$$

Here

1. $X^{I \to \ast}$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]];

1. $X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}$ is a [[Serre fibration]].

So while in general the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X$ is far from being an [[epimorphism]] or even just a [[Serre fibration]], the factorization through the [[path space object]] may be thought of as replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by its path space, such as to turn its diagonal into a Serre fibration after all.

into the [[path space object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace}, such that this fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | {\vert \vec x \vert \leq 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-disk]];

* $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | {\vert \vec x \vert = 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-sphere]];

Write

$$

    \coloneqq
  \{S^{n-1} \stackrel{\iota_n}{\hookrightarrow} D^{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
    \subset

$$

for the set of canonical [[boundary]] inclusion maps. This going to be called the set of standard **topological [[generating cofibrations]]**.

Notice that $S^{-1} = \emptyset$ and that $S^0 = \ast \sqcup \ast$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalCellComplex}
###### Definition

For $X \in Top$ and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an **$n$-cell attachment** to $X$ is the [[pushout]] of a generatic cofibration, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X {}_\phi\underset{S^{n-1}}{\sqcup} D^n
  }
$$

along some [[continuous function]] $\phi$.

A continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is called a **topological [[relative cell complex]]** if it is exhibited by a (possibly infinite) sequence of cell attachments to $X$, hence if it is a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i}{\coprod} S^{n_i - 1} &\longrightarrow& X_{k-1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i}{\coprod}\iota_{n_i}}}\downarrow 
     &(po)& \downarrow  
    \\
    \underset{i}{\coprod} D^{n_i} &\longrightarrow& X_{k}
  }
$$

of [[coproducts]] of [[generating cofibrations]].

A topological space is a **[[cell complex]]** if $\emptyset \longrightarrow X$ is a relative cell complex.

A relative cell complex is called a **finite relative cell complex** if it is obtained from a [[finite number]] of cell attachments.

A (relative) cell complex is called a (relative) **[[CW-complex]]** if in the above transfinite composition is countable 

$$
  \array{
    X = X_0 &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\longrightarrow& \cdots
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrrow & \swarrow && \cdots
    \\
    && Y = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet
  }
$$

and if $X_k$ is obtained from $X_{k-1}$ by attaching cells precisely only of [[dimension]] $k$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Strictly speaking a relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, is a function $f\colon X \to Y$, _together_ with its cell structure, hence together with the information of the pushout diagrams and the transfinite composition of the pushout maps that exhibit it.

In many applications, however,  all that matters is that there is _some_ (relative) cell decomosition, and then one tends to speak loosely and mean by a (relative) cell complex only a (relative) topological space that admits some cell decomposition.

=--

A key property of topological [[cell complexes]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex} is that they see [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspaces]] as "[[small objects]]" in the following precise sense:

+-- {: .num_prop #CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
###### Proposition

Every [[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspace]] of a topological [[cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, is contained in the [[union]] of a [[finite number]] of cells.

=--

A proof is spelled out for instance in ([Hirschhorn 15, prop.3.10, prop. 3.11, corollary 3.12](#Hirschhorn15)).

While prop. \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} depends on the precise nature of the standard cells given by [[n-disks]] with their [[boundary]] inclusion (the [[generating cofibrations]] $I_{Top}$ of def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}), the general concept of [[cell complex]] in def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex} makes sense for any other choices of basic cells:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalCCellComplex}
###### Definition

For $C \subset Mor(Top)$ any set of continuous functions, then the concept of  **topological relative $C$-cell complexes** is defined as in def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, with the boundary inclusions $\iota_n \in I_{Top}$ replaced by the maps in $C$: 

a topological relative $C$-cell complex is a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] of [[coproducts]] of the maps in $C \hookrightarrow Mor(Top)$.

=--

Given a relative $C$-cell complex $\iota \colon  X \to Y$, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, it is typically interesting to study the [[extension]] problem along $f$, i.e. to ask which topological spaces $E$ are such that every [[continuous function]] $f\colon X \longrightarrow E$ has an extension $\tilde $ along $\iota$ 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \tilde f}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If so, then this means that $E$ is sufficiently "spead out" with respect to the maps in $C$. More generally one considers this extension problem fiberwise, i.e. with both $E$ and $Y$ (hence also $X$) equipped with a map to some base space $B$.


+-- {: .num_defn #RightLiftingProperty}
###### Definition

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and a sub-[[class]] $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]], then a morphism $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms in $C$ if every [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{c}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,,
$$

with $c \in C$, has a [[lift]] $w$, in that it may be completed to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{c}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{w}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \,.
$$

We will also say that $f$ is a **$C$-fibration** if it satisfies the right lifting property against $C$.

=--


### Fibrations

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  J_{Top}
    \coloneq 
  \{D^n \stackrel{(id,\delta_0)}{\hookrightarrow} D^n \times I\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
  \subset Mor(Top)
$$

for the [[set]] of inclusions of the topological [[n-disks]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, into their [[cylinder objects]], def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, along (for definiteness) the left endpoint inclusion.

These inclusions are similar to the standard topological [[generating cofibrations]] of def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, but in contrast to these they are "acyclic" (meaning: trivial on homotopy classes of maps from "cycles" given by [[n-spheres]]) in that they are [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (example \ref{FactoringTopologicalCodiagonalThroughCylinder}).

Accordingly, $J$ is to be called the set of standard **topological [[generating acyclic cofibrations]]**.

+-- {: .num_lemma #TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes}

## Background from model category theory

This section recalls some standard arguments in [[model category]] theory.

### The small object argument

Suppose given a class $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms, the question is how to factor any given morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ through a relative $C$-cell complex, def.\ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $C$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}

$$
  f 
    \;\colon\; 
  X 
    \stackrel{C cell}{\longrightarrow} 
  \hat X
    \stackrel{C fib}{\longrightarrow} 
  Y
  \,.
$$

A first approximation to such a factorization is given simply by forming $\hat X = X_1$ by attaching **all** possible $C$-cells to $X$. Namely let

$$
  (C/f) 
   \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
       dom(c) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{c\in C}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       cod(c) &\longrightarrow& Y
    }
  \right\}
$$

be the set of **all** ways to find a $C$-cell attachment in $f$, and consider the [[pushout]] $\hat X$ of the [[coproduct]] of morphisms in $C$ over all these:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &(po)& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    X_1
  }
  \,.
$$

This gets already close to producing the intended factorization: 

First of all the resulting map $X \to X_1$ is a $C$-relative cell complex, by construction. 

Second, by the fact that the coproduct is over all commuting squres to $f$, the morphism $f$ itself makes a [[commuting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

and hence the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] means that $f$ is indeed factored through that $C$-cell complex $X_1$; we may suggestively arrange that factorizing diagram like so:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c)
     &&
    X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow 
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that, finally, the colimiting [[co-cone]] map -- the one that now appears diagonally -- **almost** exhibits the desired right lifting of $X_1 \to X$ against the $c\in C$. The failure of that to hold on the nose is only the fact that a horizontal map in the middle of the above diagram is missing: the diagonal map obtained above lifts not all commuting diagrams of $c\in C$ into $f$, but only those where the top morphism $dom(c) \to X_1$ factors through $X \to X_1$.

The idea of the [[small object argument]] now is to fix this only problem by iterating the construction: next factor $X_1 \to X$ in the same way into 

$$
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_2 \longrightarrow X
$$

and so forth. Since relative $C$-cell complexes are closed under composition, at stage $n$ the resulting $X \longrightarrow X_n$ is still a $C$-cell complex, getting bigger and bigger. But accordingly, the failure of the accompanying $X_n \longrightarrow Y$ to be a $C$-fibration becomes smaller and smaller, for it now lifts against all diagrams where $dom(c) \longrightarrow X_n$ factors through $X_{n-1}\longrightarrow X_n$, which intuitively is less and less of a condition as the $X_{n-1}$ grow larger and larger.

The concept of _[[small object]]_ is just what makes this intuition precise and finishes the small object argument. For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:

###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[category]] and $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$
a sub-[[class]] of its morphisms, say that these have _small [[domains]]_
if for every $c\in C$ and for every $C$-[[relative cell complex]] 
$f\colon X \longrightarrow \hat X$ every morphism 
$dom(c)\longrightarrow \hat X$ factors through a finite relative subcomplex.

###### Proposition
**(small object argument)**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally small category]] with all small [[colimits]]. If a [[class]] $C\subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms has all small domains in the sense of def. \ref{CollectionOfMapsBetweenSmallObjects}, then every morphism $f\colon X\longrightarrow $ in $\mathcal{C}$ factors through a $C$-[[relative cell complex]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $C$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}

$$
  f \;\colon\;
  X \stackrel{\in C cell}{\longrightarrow} \hat X \stackrel{\in C fib}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,.
$$
