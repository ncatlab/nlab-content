## Definition

Given a [[vector space]] $V$, then its _endomorphism Lie algebra_ $\mathfrak{end}(V)$ is the [[Lie algebra]] whose elements are the [[linear maps]] $\phi \colon V \to V$ and whose Lie bracket is their [[commutator]]

$$
  [\phi_1, \phi_2] = \phi_1 \circ \phi_2 - \phi_2 \circ \phi_1
  \,.
$$

A Lie algebra homomorphisms $\mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{end}(V)$ is a Lie action or _[[Lie algebra representation]]_ of $\mathfrak{g}$ on $V$.
