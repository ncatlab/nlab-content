###### Definition

For $C \in $ [[Cat]] a [[category]], its **core**

$core(C) \in$ [[Grpd]]  

is the [[groupoid]] which is the maximal [[subcategory|sub]]-[[groupoid]] of $C$: the [[subcategory]] consisting of all objects of $C$ but with [[morphisms]] only the [[isomorphisms]] of $C$.

This construction extends to a 1-[[functor]]

$$
  Core \colon Cat \to Grpd
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

We usually think of a groupoid as a special kind of category, but we can also think of a category as a groupoid equipped with additional morphisms.  (This is possible because [[Grpd]] is a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Cat]].)  One level [[decategorification|decategorified]], we usually think in the opposite way: a [[poset]] is a [[set]] equipped with a [[partial order]], but we can also think of a set as a special kind of poset (specifically, a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] one).

## Properties

### Universal property

###### Proposition

The core-functor of def. \ref{CoreOfCategories} is [[right adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $U \colon Grpd \to Cat$ from groupoids to categories.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a [[category]] $C$ and a [[groupoid]] $A$, a [[functor]]

$$
 A \to C
$$

(hence a functor out of the underlying category $U(A)$ of $A$)
has to send [[isomorphisms]] to isomorphisms, hence has to send every [[morphism]] of $A$ to an [[isomorphism]] in $C$. This means that it factors through the core-inclusion

$$
  A \to Core(C) \to C
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The [[left adjoint]] to $U \colon Grpd \to Cat$ is the [[localization]] functor that universally inverts every morphism in $C$. On [[nerves]] this is [[Kan fibrant replacement]].

## Variations and generalizations

### $\dagger$-Categories

The __core__ of a [[dagger category]] consists of its [[unitary morphism|unitary]] isomorphisms only.  This is why, for example, it makes sense to think of [[Hilb]] either as a category whose morphisms are linear maps bounded by $1$ or as a dagger category whose morphisms are all linear maps; either way, the core is the same (invertible linear maps of norm exactly $1$).


### Higher categories

The __core__ of an $n$-[[n-category|category]] is the $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoid]] consisting only of [[equivalence]]s at each level; the __core__ of an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] is similarly an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]]: the core of a [[quasicategory]] is the maximal [[Kan complex]] inside it.

For more on this see also at _[[category object in an (infinity,1)-category]]_.
