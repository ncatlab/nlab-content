## Definition

A [[monoid]] (or [[semigroup]]) $M$ is a __principal left ideal monoid__ if all left [[ideal of a monoid|ideals]] of $M$ are left [[principal ideal of a monoid|principal ideals]] in $M$. Similarily, $M$ is a __principal right ideal monoid__ if all right [[ideal of a monoid|ideals]] of $M$ are right [[principal ideal of a monoid|principal ideals]]. Finally, $M$ is a __principal ideal monoid__ if it is both a principal left ideal monoid and a principal right ideal monoid. 

## Examples

A [[group]] is a principal ideal monoid $G$ whose only ideal is isomorphic to $G$ itself.
