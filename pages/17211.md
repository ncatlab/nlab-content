## Idea

Given any [[ring spectrum]] $E$, then the _Boardman homomorphism_ is the [[homomorphism]] from [[homotopy groups]] to $E$-[[generalized homology]] groups that is induced by [[smash product]] with the ring unit map $\mathbb{S} \longrightarrow E$ from the [[sphere spectrum]]:

$$
  \pi_\bullet(-)
  \simeq
  \pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S} \wedge (-))
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge (-))
  =
  E_\bullet(-)
  \,.
$$

For $E = H \mathbb{Z}$ the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] for [[ordinary homology]], then this reduces to the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]] $\pi_\bullet(-) \to H_\bullet(-)$.

Dually, there is the Boardman homomorphism from [[stable cohomotopy]] to [[generalized cohomology]] induced under forming [[mapping spectra]] into the unit map of $E$:

$$
  \pi^\bullet(-)
  \simeq
  \pi_\bullet([(-),\mathbb{S}])
   \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet([(-),E])
   =
  E^\bullet(-)
  \,.
$$ 

Unifying these two cases, there is the bivariant Boardman homomorphism


$$
  [X, Y]_\bullet \simeq [X, Y \wedge \mathbb{S}]_\bullet \longrightarrow [X,Y \wedge E]_\bullet
  \,.
$$

Since [[generalized homology]]/[[generalized cohomology]] is typically more tractable than [[homotopy groups]]/[[cohomotopy]] (in particular when [[homology spectra split]]), the Boardman homomorphism is often used to partially reduce computations of the latter in terms of computations of the former. 

One example is the computation of the homotopy grous of [[MU]] via the [[homology of MU]] ([[Quillen's theorem on MU]]), see [below](#ForComplexOrientedCohomologyTheories).
