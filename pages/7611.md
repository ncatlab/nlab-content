## Idea

A **cartesian multicategory** is a [[multicategory]]-like structure which is related to categories with finite [[products]] in the same way that ordinary categories are related to [[monoidal categories]].

## Definition

### Explicit

A **cartesian multicategory** is a symmetric [[multicategory]] equipped with:

* *duplication* or *diagonal* or *contraction* operations
  $$ hom(c_0,\dots,c_{k-1},c_k,c_k,c_{k+1},\dots,c_n \;;\; d) \to hom(c_0,\dots,c_{k-1},c_k,c_{k+1},\dots,c_n \;;\; d)$$

* *deletion* or *projection* or *weakening* operations
  $$ hom(c_0,\dots,c_k,c_{k+2},\dots,c_n \;;\; d) \to hom(c_0,\dots,c_k,c_{k+1},c_{k+2},\dots,c_n \;;\; d) $$

which satisfy certain evident axioms.

### As a generalized multicategory

A cartesian multicategory can equivalently be defined as a [[generalized multicategory]] relative to the monad on [[Cat]] (or more precisely [[Prof]]) whose algebras are categories with (strict) finite products.

### As a free category with finite products

A cartesian multicategory can also be defined as a category with specified finite products whose set of objects under the "product" operation is a free monoid on specified generators.

When there is exactly one such generator, this recovers the definition of a [[Lawvere theory]]; thus a cartesian multicategory may be considered a "colored" or "many-object" Lawvere theory.  Note, though, that the morphisms of cartesian multicategories are more restrictive than morphisms of finite-product categories; they are required to take generators to generators.


## Representability

A cartesian multicategory, like an ordinary multicategory, is **[[representable multicategory|representable]]** if for any finite list $(c_1,\dots,c_n)$ of objects there exists an object "$c_1\otimes\cdots\otimes c_n$" and a morphism $c_1,\dots,c_n \to c_1\otimes\cdots\otimes c_n$ which is universal, in that the following induced functions are all bijections:

$$ hom(d_1,\dots,d_k, c_1\otimes\cdots\otimes c_n , e_1,\dots,e_m \;;\; f) \to
hom(d_1,\dots,d_k, c_1,\dots,c_n, e_1,\dots,e_m \;;\; f)
$$

Just as representable (symmetric) multicategories are equivalent to (symmetric) monoidal categories, representable cartesian multicategories are equivalent to categories with [[finite products]].

More abstractly, representable cartesian multicategories are the algebras for a [[colax-idempotent 2-monad]] on the 2-category of cartesian multicategories, whose algebras are categories with finite products.


## Syntax, semantics, and type theory

Small cartesian multicategories may be considered presentations of "many-sorted finite-product theories".  On the spectrum between syntax and semantics, they sit in between a fully syntactic presentation (such as a [[type theory]]) and a fully incarnated semantic one (the [[walking structure|free category]] with finite products generated by a model of some theory).

Cartesian multicategories are also a natural place to talk about the semantics of [[type theory]].  Every type theory (with [[contraction rule|contraction]] and [[weakening rule|weakening]], and without [[dependent types]]) gives rise to a cartesian multicategory whose objects are its types and whose multimorphisms are its terms.  This is in contrast to the usual construction of an ordinary category from a type theory, in which we have to take the objects to be [[contexts]] in order to recapture all the terms.  This usual [[category of contexts]] can be recaptured as the free category-with-finite-products generated by this cartesian multicategory of types.  Similarly, we can talk about models of such a type theory in any cartesian multicategory.
