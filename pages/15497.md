Like the consumer trying the private-label cereal for the first time, industrial workers are now asking the question: do these private-label work gloves have the same quality and safety protection as the brand of work gloves I’ve used in the past? The answer to that question in many cases is yes. Often times, a leather palm glove or knit work glove manufactured by a well-known industrial company is produced by the same industrial plant that also manufactures gloves with no brand on them. They use much of the same process, same materials, and hold the same quality standards for both versions. Like the grocery store items, however, the private-label gloves are priced much lower in the marketplace than the branded gloves. Industrial companies who have a tight budget and are looking for high-quality alternatives can source these private-label safety products and save money without compromising employee safety.
