#Idea#

What is called the "BRST complex" in physics literture is the [[Lie infinity-algebroid|qDGCA]] which is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] which is the differential version in [[Lie theory]] if the $\infty$-groupoid 

 * whose space of objects is the space of configurations/histories of a given physical system;

 * whose morphisms describe the gauge transformations between these configurations/histories;

 * whose $k$-morphisms descrive the $k$-fold gauge-of-gauge transformations.

The generators of the BRST complex are called

 * in degree 0: **fields**;

 * in degree 1: **ghosts**;

 * in degree 2: **ghosts of ghosts**;

 * etc.

#Relation to BV theory#

In as far as the BRST complex can be regarded as being the algebra of functions on an $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]], the theory of [[integration over supermanifolds|integration]] over this $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] is given by the [[BV theory|BV formalism]].
