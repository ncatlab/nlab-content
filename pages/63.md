## Idea

What is called the "BRST complex" in [[physics]] literture is the [[Lie infinity-algebroid|qDGCA]] which is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] which is the differential version in [[Lie theory]] if the $\infty$-groupoid 

 * whose space of objects is the space of configurations/histories of a given physical system;

 * whose morphisms describe the gauge transformations between these configurations/histories;

 * whose $k$-morphisms descrive the $k$-fold gauge-of-gauge transformations.

The generators of the BRST complex are called

 * in degree 0: **fields**;

 * in degree 1: **ghosts**;

 * in degree 2: **ghosts of ghosts**;

 * etc.

## Examples
 {#Example}

### Gauge theory of a Lie algebra valued connection

We discuss the BRST complex for a field theory such as [[Yang-Mills theory]] or [[Chern-Simons theory]] whose [[configuration space]] is one of [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $G$-[[principal bundles]] for some [[Lie group]] $G$ -- the _[[gauge group]]_ . For simplicity of the exposition we first restrict attention to the cases where the underlying bundles are trivial. 

In that case, over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, 

* a field configuration is a [[differential form]] $A$ on $X$ with values in the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$

  $$
    A \in \Omega^1(X, \mathfrak{g})
  $$

* a [[gauge transformation]] $A_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} A_2$ between two field configurations $A$ and $A'$ is given by a [[smooth function]] $g : X \to G$ such that

  $$  
    A_2 = g^{-1} A_1 g + g^{-1} d_{dR} g
    \,.
  $$

Eventually we want to say that the full [[configuration space]] is therefore the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued 1-forms]] on $X$, but we will be interested now only in the [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] approximation to the gauge transformations. Since the infinitesimal approximation of a Lie group is its [[Lie algebra]], these infinitesimal gauge transformations are given by smooth functions $\lambda : X \to \mathfrak{g}$ to from $X$ to the Lie algebra of $G$, relating field configurations by

\[
  \label{InfinitesimalGaugeTransformation}
  A_2 = [A_1, \lambda] + d \lambda 
  \,.
\]

To see more in detail what this equation means, we choose a [[basis]] $\{t_a\}$ for the [[vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}$ that underlies the Lie algebra. In terms of this basis the Lie bracket is defined by its structure constants $\{C^a{}_{b c} \in \mathbb{R}\}$ defined by

$$
  [t_b, t_c] = C^a{}_{b c} t_a
  \,.
$$ 

In terms of this a field configuration decomposes into components $\{A^a \in \Omega^1(X)\}$ defined by

$$
  A = A^a t_a \in \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g}) \simeq \Omega^1(X)\otimes \mathfrak{g}
$$

and equation (eq:InfinitesimalGaugeTransformation) for infinitesimal gauge transformations reads equivalently

$$
  A_2^a = C^a{}_{b c} A^b \lambda^c + d_{dR} \lambda^a
  \,.
$$

The BRST complex is a [[cochain complex]] of functions -- on this configuration space and on these gauge transformations. 

A typical smooth function on the space $\Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g})$ of field configurations is the function that evaluates a field configuration at some point $x \in X$ on some vector $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}$ and picks the resulting component of $t_a$. We write for this

$$
  \mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x) : \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
  A \mapsto A^a_\mu(x)
  \,.
$$

Analogously we have functions on the space $\Omega^0(X,\mathfrak{g})$ of gauge transformations that evaluate at a point $x$ and pick the component of $t_a$. These we write

$$
  \mathbf{c}^a (x) : \Omega^0(X, \mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}
$$

$$ 
  \lambda \mapsto \lambda^a(x)  
  \,.
$$

Moreover, there exists smooth functions of this kind that evaluate not $A$ or $\lambda$ themselves, but some [[derivative]] of them.

The general kind of functions on the configuration space and on the space of gauge transformation that we want to consider can be thought of as being generated by such _[[variational bicomplex|local functions]]_ .

But since the $\mathbf{c}^a(x)$ are functions on gauge transformations, which are [[1-morphism]]s in the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued forms]], while the $\mathbf{A}^a(x)$ are functions on ordinary elements of this groupoid ([[0-morphisms]]) we declare them to be in degree 1, too. 

(Fundamentally what is going in here is that we form [[function algebras on infinity-stacks]], as described there in more detail.)

In other words, we regard the smooth functions on field configurations and on gauge transformations as forming a $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded algebra]], where

* functions like $\mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x)$, $C^a{}_{b c}\mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x) \mathbf{A}^b_\nu(x) : \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}$ etc. are in degree 0;

* functions like $\mathbf{c}^a(x)$, $C^a{}_{b c}\mathbf{c}^a(x) \mathbf{A}^b_\mu(x) : \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}$ etc. are in degree 1;

* functions like $C^a{}_{b c}\mathbf{c}^a(x) \mathbf{c}(x)$ are in degree 2;

* etc. 

Moreover, we declare the elements in degree 1 to anticommute with each other

$$
  \mathbf{c}^a(x)\mathbf{c}^b(x) = 
  -
  \mathbf{c}^b(x)\mathbf{c}^a(x)\mathbf{c}^b(x)
  \,.
$$

So far this describes a [[graded algebra]] of functions. What is still missing is the information encoded in equation (eq:InfinitesimalGaugeTransformation), which links the gauge transformations with the field configurations that they act on. 

By that formula, if we evaluate the functional $\mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x)$ not on a field $A$ itself, but the gauge transformation of this field by some $\lamba$, then the result is not $A^a_\mu(x)$ but $C^a{}_{b c} A^b_\mu(x)\lambda^c(x) + (d\lambda)_\mu^a(x)$. Therefore on gauge transformed fields the functional $\mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x)$ is replaced by

$$
  \mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x) \mapsto 
  d_{BSRT}\mathbf{A}^a_\mu(x)
  := 
C^a{}_{b c} \mathbf{A}^b_\mu(x) \mathbf{c}^c(x) + d \mathbf{c}^a  
  \,.
$$

A similarly analysis shows that 

$$
  d_{BRST} \mathbf{c}^a(x) = 
  -\frac{1}{2}C^a{}_{b c} \mathbf{c}^b(x) \mathbf{c}^c(x)
  \,.
$$

This operation $d_{BRST}$ of "shifting functionals of fields and gauge transformations by infinitesimal gauge transformations" promotes the [[graded algebra]] constructed so far to a [[differential graded algebra]]. This is the BRST-complex of the given system.

In a precise sense, this differential graded algebra, encodes the infinitesimal [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued 1-forms]] that it is an algebra of functions on in the same way that an algebra of functions on some manifold characterizes that manifold.

Using this, we can now discuss [[observable]]s on the configurations of the gauge theory in question. 

First notice that if we had no gauge transformations, then configuration space were an ordinary manifold $X$, and an observable were simply a function on that

$$
  X \to \mathbb{R}
  \,,
$$

namely an assignment of a number to each field configuration (say the energy or momentum, assigned to each field configuration).

Similarly now an observable on the gauge system is a morphism

$$
  \Omega^1(X, \mathfrak{g})//\Omega^0(X,\mathfrak{g})
  \to 
  \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

We find that such morphism are precisely those functions $\Omega^1(X, \mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}$ which are gauge invariant.
