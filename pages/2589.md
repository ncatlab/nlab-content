## Definition 

The **Fivebrane group** $Fivebrane(n)$  is defined to be, as a [[topological group]], the [[Whitehead tower|7-connected cover]] of the [[String group]] $String(n)$, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Notice that $String(n)$ itself if the 3-connected cover of $Spin(n)$,  which is itself is the [[Whitehead tower|simply connected cover]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$, which in turn is the connected component (of the identity)  of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$. Hence $Fivebrane(n)$ is one element in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $\mathrm{O}(n)$:

$$
  \cdots \to Fivebrane(n) \to String(n) \to Spin(n) \to SO(n) \to \mathrm{O}(n)
  \,.
$$


The [[homotopy group]]s of $O(n)$ are for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and for sufficiently large $n$

$$
  \array{
     \pi_{8k+0}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2
     \\
     \pi_{8k+1}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2
     \\
     \pi_{8k+2}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+3}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}
     \\
     \pi_{8k+4}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+5}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+6}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{8k+7}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

By [[Whitehead tower|co-killing]] these groups step by step one gets

$$
  \array{
     cokill\; this &&&& to \;get
     \\
     \\
     \pi_{0}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2 &&& SO
     \\
     \pi_{1}(O) & = \mathbb{Z}_2 &&& Spin
     \\
     \pi_{2}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{3}(O) & = \mathbb{Z} &&& String
     \\
     \pi_{4}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{5}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{6}(O) & = 0
     \\
     \pi_{7}(O) & = \mathbb{Z} &&& Fivebrane
  }
  \,.
$$


## Further information... 

Note that if $3 \leq n \leq 6$, one needs to take extra care, as $String(n)$ is not 6-connected in this range (see [[orthogonal group]] for a table of the relevant homotopy groups). There are nontrivial intermediate steps in the Whitehead tower

...should eventually go here. For the time being have a look at [[Fivebrane structure]].
