###### Definition

For $(X_j, \omega_j)$ two [[symplectic manifold]]s, a **Lagrangian correspondence** is a submanifold of $X^-_0 \times X_1$

$$
  \iota : L_{0,1} \hookrightarrow X^-_0 \times X_1
$$

with $dim(L_{0,1}) = \frac{1}{2}(dim(X_0) + dim(X_1))$

and

$$
  \iota^*(-\pi_0^* \omega_0 + \pi_1^* \omega_1) = 0
  \,,
$$

where $\pi_i$ are the two projections out of the [[product]].



The **composition** of two Lagrangian submanifolds is

$$
  L_{01} \circ L_{12} := 
    \pi_{02}(L_{01} \times_{X_1} L_{12})
$$

which is a Lagrangian correspondence in $X^-_0 \times X_2$ if everything is suitably smoothly embedded by $\pi_{02}$.

## Examples

1. For $\phi : X_0 \to X_1$ a [[symplectomorphism]] we have

   $graph(\phi) \subset X_0^- \times X_1$ is a Lagrangian correspondence and 
   composition of syplectomorphisms corresponds to composition of 
   Lagrangian correspondences.

1. Let $X$ be a [[manifold]], $G= U(n)$ the [[unitary group]], 
   $P \to X$ a $G$-[[principal bundle]]
   and $D \to X$ a $U(1)$-bundle with [[connection on a bundle|connection]].
   
   Then there is the [[moduli space]] $M(X) = M(P,D)$ 
   of connections on $P$ with central curvature and given determinant.
   
   For example if $X$ has [[genus]] $g$ then
   
   $$
     M(X) = \{ (A,B, \cdots, A_g, B_g) \in G^{2g}\} 
   $$
   
   such that $\prod_{j=1}^g A_j B_j A_j^{-1} B_j^{-1} = diag(e^{2\pi i d/})/G$
   
   Let $Y_{01}$ be a [[cobordism]] from $X_0$ to $X_1$ with extension
   
   $$
     L(Y_{01}) = Image(M(Y_{01}) \stackrel{restr.}{\to} 
     M(X_0)^- \times M(X_1) )
   $$
   
   is a Lagrangian correspondence if $Y_{01}$ is sufficiently simple. 
   Further assuming this
   we have for composition that

   $$
      L(Y_{01} \circ Y_{12}) = L(Y_{01}) \circ L(Y_{12})
      \,.
   $$
