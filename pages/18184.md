## Idea

In [[topology]] an _attaching space_ is [[topological spaces]], denoted $X \cup_{f} Y$, which is constructed by "attaching" or "gluing" two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ along a [[topological subspace]] $A \subset X$ by means of a [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \to Y$. The function $f$ is then also called the _attaching map_.
 
More [[category theory|abstractly]], attaching spaces are [[pushouts]] along [[monomorphisms]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of all [[topological spaces]]. The [[formal dual|formally dual]] concept is that of [[fiber]] spaces or more generally of [[fiber products]] of topological spaces.

## Definition

The attaching space may be realized as the [[quotient topological space]] of the [[disjoint union space]] $X \sqcup Y$ by the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies a point $x \in A \subset X$ with its [[image]] $f(x) \in Y$:


$$
  A \cup_f B 
  \;\simeq\;
  \left(
    X \sqcup Y
  \right)/\sim
  \,.
$$

More [[category theory|category theoretically]], the attaching space is the [[pushout]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] of the subspace inclusion $i \colon A \hookrightarrow X$ along $f$, i.e. the topological space which is [[universal property|universal]] with the property that it makes the following [[commuting square|square commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{\phantom{A}i\phantom{A}}{\hookrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& X \cup_f Y
  }
  \,.
$$

## Examples

* In forming topological [[cell complexes]] such as [[CW-complexes]], one consecutively forms attaching spaces along [[n-sphere]] inclusions as [[boundaries]] of [[n-disks]].
