## Definition

The _Picard groupoid_ $PIC(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ of a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is its [[full subcategory]] on the objects that are [[invertible objects]] under the tensor operation. This inherits the monoidal structure from $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ and hence becomes a [[2-group]]. This is the **Picard 2-group** of $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$.

In geometric contexts this is also called the _[[Picard stack]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to Picard group

The [[decategorification]] of the Picard 2-group, hence the [[group]] of connected components, is the ordinary [[Picard group]] $Pic(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$.

$$
  Pic(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) \simeq \pi_0 PIC(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)
  \,.
$$
