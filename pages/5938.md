Given a functor $F: C\to D$ we say that $F$ __admits a proadjoint__ if the canonical extension $pro(F): pro(C)\to pro(D)$ of $F$ to the categories of [[pro-object]]s
has a left adjoint $G$. In other words, there is a functor $G: pro(D)\to pro(C)$ and a bijection

$$
pro(C)(GY',X) \cong pro(D)(Y',y(F)X)
$$

natural in $X$ and $Y'$, where $y:C\hookrightarrow pro(C)$ is the Yoneda embedding into the category of proobjects $pro(C)\subset Set^{C^{op}}$. Equivalently, for every [[prorepresentable functor]] $X:C'^{op}\to Set$, the functor $X\mapsto X\circ F$ is also prorepresentable.
