## Definition ##

For $\infty Grpd$ the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoids]], and for $S$ a [[(∞,1)-category]] (or in fact any [[simplicial set]]), an **$(\infty,1)$-presheaf** on $S$ is an $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  F : S^{op} \to \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

The **$(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-presheaves** is the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]]

$$
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(S) := Func(S^{op}, \infinity Grpd)
  \,.
$$

## Models ##

A [[model category|model]] for such $(\infty,1)$-presheaf categories is the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. See also the discussion at [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]].
