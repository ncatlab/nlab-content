#Definition#

For $\infty Grpd$ the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[infinity-groupoid]]s, and for $S$ a [[(infinity,1)-category]] (or in fact any [[simplicial set]]), an **$(\infty,1)$-presheaf** on $S$ is an $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  F : S^{op} \to \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

The **$(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-presheaves** is the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-functors]]

$$
  PSh(S) := Func(S^{op}, \infinity Grpd)
  \,.
$$
