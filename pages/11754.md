A _metrization theorem_ is a result that gives sufficient conditions, and sometimes necessary and sufficient conditions, for a [[topological space]] to be [[metrisable topological space|metrisable]], i.e. its topology is induced by a metric. 

Examples include: 

* [[Urysohn metrization theorem]] 

* Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem 

* Bing metrization theorem 

* Moore metrization theorem 

A refined and more complicated question is whether or not the topology of a given space is induced by a [[complete space|complete metric]]. In this case the space is called [[topologically complete space|topologically complete]] A sufficient and neceissary criterion can be given in terms of [[cotopology#Properties|cotopology]].

If one weakens the concept of metric space sufficiently to the notion of [[approach space]], then every topological space is metrisable in this weaker sense.
