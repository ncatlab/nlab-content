A _metrization theorem_ is a result that gives sufficient conditions, and sometimes necessary and sufficient conditions, for a [[topological space]] to be [[metric space|metrizable]]. 

Examples include: 

* [[Urysohn metrization theorem]] 

* Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem 

* Bing metrization theorem 

* Moore metrization theorem
