## Idea

Differential algebraic K-theory is the [[differential cohomology]]-refinement of [[algebraic K-theory]].

In ([Bunke-Tamme 12](#BunkeTamme12)) this is realized effectively as the [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]] of the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] of the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]

$$
  Sh_\infty\left(SmthMfd, Sh_\infty\left(Sch_{\mathbb{Z}}\right)\right)
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\leftarrow}}}}
  Sh_\infty(Sch_{\mathbb{Z}})
$$

of [[∞-stacks]] on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]] with values in turn in [[∞-stack]] over a [[site]] of [[arithmetic schemes]], hence by [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] but over a [[base (∞,1)-topos]] of algebraic [[∞-stacks]].

This may be regarded as sitting inside the [[smooth E-∞-groupoids]].

It is observed in this context that the [[Beilinson regulator]] in [[algebraic K-theory]] is naturally understood as a [[Chern character]] in this perspective of [[differential cohomology]] ([Bunke-Tamme 12](#BunkeTamme12)), which helps with studying it.


## Definition

There is a refinement of the [[Beilinson regulator]] to a smoothly parameterized version $\mathbf{K}$ of [[algebraic K-theory]].

Differential algebraic K-theory is the [[homotopy pullback]] of that along a suitable inclusion of cycles. ([Bunke-Tamme 13, def. 3.1](#BunkeTamme13))

## Applications
