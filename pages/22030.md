METEOROLOGY

CHEMISTRY
each of two or more isotopes of different elements, with the same atomic weight.

Isobars are atoms (nuclides) of **different chemical elements that have the same number of nucleons**. Correspondingly, isobars differ in atomic number (or number of protons) but have the same mass number. An example of a series of isobars would be 40S, 40Cl, 40Ar, 40K, and 40Ca. While the nuclei of these nuclides all contain 40 nucleons, they contain varying numbers of protons and neutrons.[1]
