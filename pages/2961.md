_The Joy of Cats_ is a book by [[Jiri Adamek|Jiří Adámek]], [[Horst Herrlich]], and [[George Strecker]] whose full title is _Abstract and Concrete Categories: The Joy of Cats_. It is available [online](http://katmat.math.uni-bremen.de/acc).


The reader should beware that the book uses the term "quasicategory" for what  _[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]_ calls a [[metacategory]]: a model (in the informal sense) of the first-order theory of a category, with no regard for size issues. These days a [[quasicategory]] is a particular type of [[simplicial set]] that models an [[(∞,1)-category]].
