## Idea

A [[sheaf]] of [[vertex operator algebras]]. 

This arises naturally in the descriptions of [[2d CFTs]] such as the [[2d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] which patchwise on [[target space]] is a [[free field theory]], but not globally so.

If the degree-0 part of a sheaf of vertex operator algebras is the [[structure sheaf]] of the base space, then one one may think of the whole sheaf as defining a "[[horizontal categorification]]" of a vertex operator algebra and hence one also speaks of a _[[vertex operator algebroid]]_.

## Examples

* [[chiral de Rham complex]]
