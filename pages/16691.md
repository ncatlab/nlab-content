## Idea

In the present [[standard model of particle physics]] the [[proton]] is a stable [[bound state]] (of [[quarks]]). But in some hypothetical extensions of the standard model, notably in many [[GUT]] [[model (physics)|models]] the proton would be unstable, albeit with an extremely long decay time.

Experimental searches for rare proton decay have with negative results therefore constrain or rule out many [[model (physics)|models]] beyond the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]].

More recently it has been claimed that [[GUT]] [[model (physics)|models]] may entirely avoid proton decay after all ([Mütter-Ratz-Vaudrevange 16](#MuetterRatzVaudrevange16), [Fornal-Grinstein 17](#FornalGrinstein17)).
