The word _homotopy_ is used for different but closely related notions:

* [[homotopy (as a transformation)]] denotes the transformation between two continuous maps between [[topological spaces]], i.e. a [[2-morphism]] in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] [[Top]] -- or more generally any [[2-morphism]] in any [[(infinity,1)-category]], often modeled as a (left or right) homotopy in a [[model category]] or [[category of fibrant objects]];

* [[homotopy (as an operation)]] denotes the operation (the [[functor]]) of assigning [[homotopy group]]s to spaces in [[Top]] or, more generally, to objects in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]].

The latter operation involves taking equivalence relations with respect to the former transformation.

I think that if we\'re going to organise the pages like this, then we should go through the links to this page and sort most of them out to point to one of the pages above.  Certainly if somebody writes 'Let $h$ be a [[homotopy]] from $f$ to $g$.', they\'re going to naturally link here, but now it should link to [[homotopy (as a transformation)]].  (If *most* links are like that ---I haven\'t checked yet---, then perhaps that page should come back here.)  ---Toby
