The Euler beta function has been defined by [[Euler]] around 1730 by the so called Euler beta integral

$$
B(x,y) = \int_0^1 t^{x-1} (1-t)^{y-1} d t = \frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)},\,\,\,\,\,\,Re x\gt 0, \,\,\,\,Re y \gt 0,
$$

which can be expressed in terms of the gamma function as stated. 

A multidimensional generalization is the [[Selberg integral]].
