## Idea

_Zuckerman induction_ is a special case of [[induced representations|co-induced representations]]:

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] and $K$ a suitable [[algebraic]] group, write $(\mathfrak{g}, K)Mod$ for the [[category]] of [[Harish-Chandra modules]] over $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$. Then for $i \colon T \hookrightarrow K$ an algebraic [[subgroup]] there is the corresponding [[forgetful functor]] $ i^* \colon (\mathfrak{g}, K)Mod \to (\mathfrak{g}, T)Mod$ which restricts the representation along the inclusion. 

This functor has a [[right adjoint]] [[coinduced representation]] functor

$$
  i_* \colon (\mathfrak{g}, T)Mod \to (\mathfrak{g}, K)Mod
$$

and this is called the _Zuckerman functor_. ([MP, 1](#MP)).

The discussion of the [[derived functor]] of this is sometimes called _[[cohomological induction]]_.
