## Idea

An _asymptotic series_ is a [[formal power series]] that may not [[convergence|converge]], but whose terms decrease fast enough such that the truncation of the series at any finite order still provides a controled approximation to a given [[function]]. 

## Definition

###### Definition

Given a [[function]] $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, a [[formal power series]] $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ is an 
**asymptotic expansion** of $f$ at $x = 0$ if for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the difference between $f$ and the [[sum]] of the first $n$ terms of the series divided by $x^n$ is zero as $x$ tends to 0:

$$
  \underset{x \to 0}{\lim} \; \frac{1}{x^n}
  \left(
    f(x)  - \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k x^k
  \right)
  = 0
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This definition makes makes no statement about the behaviour as $n \to \infty$. In particular an asymptotic series may have vanishing [[radius of convergence]] (and nevertheless provide useful approximate information).

## Examples

###### Example

The [[Taylor series]] of a [[smooth function]] at any point is always an [[asymptotic series]], regardless of whether its [[radius of convergence]] vanishes or not.

###### Example

The [[perturbation series]] in [[quantum field theory]] is typically an asymptotic expansion.
