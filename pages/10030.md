## Idea

### General

An _asymptotic series_ is a [[formal power series]] that may not [[convergence|converge]], but whose terms decrease fast enough such that the truncation of the series at any finite order still provides a controled approximation to a given [[function]].  

A key class of examples of asymptotic series are [[Taylor series]] of [[smooth functions]] (example \ref{TaylorSeriesOfSmoothFunctionIsAsymptoticSeries} below) around any point.

In [[resurgence theory]] one tries to re-identify from an asymptotic series the corresponding [[analytic function|non-analytic]] contributions.


### In perturbative quantum field theory

The concept of asymptotic expansions plays a key role in the interpretation of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (pQFT): This computes [[quantum observables]] as [[formal power series]] (in the [[coupling constant]] and in [[Planck's constant]]) whose [[radius of convergence]] necessarily vanishes in cases of interest ([Dyson 52](#Dyson52)). 

Nevertheless, for examples such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]] as in the [[standard model of particle physics]], the truncation of these series to the first handful of [[loop orders]]  happens to agree with [[experiment]] (such as at the [[LHC]] collider) to high precision (for [[QED]]) or at least good precision (for [[QCD]]). Therefore one interprets the [[scattering matrix]] in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] as an asymptotic series. 

By example \ref{TaylorSeriesOfSmoothFunctionIsAsymptoticSeries} this makes sense if one assumes that [[pQFT]] computes the [[Taylor series]] expansion of the observables of a [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] around the point where the [[Planck constant]]/[[coupling constant]] vanishes.

With [[resurgence theory]] one may try to deduce from the asymptotic [[Feynman perturbation series]] the hidden [[non-perturbative effects]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a [[function]] $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, a [[formal power series]] $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ is an 
**asymptotic expansion** of $f$ at $x = 0$ if for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the difference between $f$ and the [[sum]] of the first $n$ terms of the series divided by $x^n$ is zero as $x$ tends to 0:

$$
  \underset{x \to 0}{\lim} 
  \left( 
    \frac{1}{x^n}
    \left(
      f(x)  - \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k x^k
    \right)
  \right)
  \;=\; 
  0
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This definition makes makes no statement about the behaviour as $n \to \infty$. In particular an asymptotic series may have vanishing [[radius of convergence]] (and nevertheless provide useful approximate information).

## Examples

###### Example
**([[Taylor series]] of [[smooth function]] is asymptotic series)**

The [[Taylor series]] of a [[smooth function]] $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ at any point is always an [[asymptotic series]], regardless of whether its [[radius of convergence]] vanishes or not.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows from the [[Hadamard lemma]], which says that for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and each expansion point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ (which we may without restrict of generality assume to be $x_0 = 0$) there exists a smooth function $h_n \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that 

$$
  f(x) = f(0) + x f^{(0)}(0) + \frac{1}{2} x^2 f^{(2)}(0) 
  + \cdots +
  \frac{1}{n!} x^n f^{n}(0)
  + 
 \frac{1}{(n+1)!} x^{n+1} h_n(x)
  \,,
$$

where $f^{(k)} \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ denotes the $k$th [[derivative]] of $f$.

Therefore with 

$$
  (a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \frac{1}{k!} f^{(k)}(0)
  \right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}
$$

the [[coefficients]] of the [[Taylor series]] of $f$ at $x_0 = 0$, we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \underset{x \to 0}{\lim}
    \left(  
      \frac{1}{x^n}
      \left(
        f(x)  - \sum_{k = 0}^n  a_k x^k
      \right)
    \right)
    & =
    \underset{x \to 0}{\lim} 
    \left( 
      \frac{1}{x^n}
      \left(
        \frac{1}{(n+1)!} x^{n+1} h_n(x)
      \right)   
    \right)
    \\
    & = 
    \underset{x \to 0}{\lim} 
    \left(
      x \frac{1}{(n+1)!} h_n(x)
    \right)   
    \\
    & = 
    0 \cdot \frac{1}{(n+1)!} h_n(0)
    \\
    & = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

## History

From [Suslov 05](#Suslov05):

> Classical books on diagrammatic techniques $[$in [[perturbative quantum field theory]]$]$ describe the construction of [[Feynman diagram|diagram]] series as if they were well defined. However, almost all important [[Feynman perturbation series|perturbation series]] are hopelessly [[divergent series|divergent]] since they have zero [[radii of convergence]]. The first argument to this effect was [given by Dyson](#Dyson52) with regard to [[quantum electrodynamics]].

> $[$...$]$

> Even though Dysonâ€™s argument is unquestionable, it was hushed up or decried for many years: the scientific community was not ready to face the problem of the hopeless divergency of perturbation series.

> $[$...$]$

> The modern status of divergent series suggests that techniques for manipulating them should be included in a minimum syllabus for graduate students in theoretical physics. However, the theory of divergent series is almost unknown to physicists, because the corresponding parts of standard university courses in calculus date back to the mid-nineteenth century, when divergent series were virtually banished from mathematics.
