## Idea

_Inductive families_ are a generalization of [[inductive types]]. Instead of defining a single type inductively, one defines a whole family of them. A key example is the inductively defined [[identity type]], where one defines for each two elements the type of their equality proofs. 
Another example is the family of finite types, indexed by the natural numbers.

## History
Inductive families were defined in [Dybjer](#Dybjer) and simultaneously studied by [Coquand and Paulin](#CoquandPaulin).
[Dybjer and Setzer](#DybjerSetzer) distinguish two kinds of inductive families, _restricted_ and _general_ ones. The identity type as an example of the latter, but not of the former.

[[Lean]] implements the reduction of (general) inductive families to recursors.

## Semantics
Standard inductive types, [[W-types]] can be interpreted in any topos with [[natural numbers object]] (Moerdijk-Palmgren). Gambino and Hyland construct initial algebras for dependent [[polynomial functors]]. Indexed containers are the same as indexed polynomial functors [indexed containers](#AGHMM).

## Higher categorical version/ homotopy type theory
[Sattler](#Sattler) claims to have a generalization to higher categories/[[homotopy type theory]].
