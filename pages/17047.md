## Idea

_Inductive families_ generalize [[inductive types]]. Instead of defining a single type inductively, one simultaneously defines a whole family of types. An alternative term is "indexed inductive definition".

A simple example of an inductive family is the type of vectors Vect n indexed by the dimension n. This is defined by two constructors: one for the empty vector of dimension 0, and another for the operation which constructs a vector of dimension n+1 by adding a component to a vector of dimension n. The family of finite types Fin n (indexed by n) can also be defined as an inductive family: the constructor 0 is in any Fin n, and there is a successor operation which constructs an element in Fin (n+1) from an element in Fin n.

By the identification of [[propositions as types]], inductive families correspond to inductively defined predicates. For example, the [[identity type]] on a type A can be defined inductively by the reflexivity rule stipulating that a is identical to a for any a : A, that is, identity is the least reflexive relation. The identity family of types in intuitionistic type theory results from the identification of this relation with a family of types.

## History
The inductively defined identity type was introduced by Martin-L&#246;f 1973 in his first published paper on Intuitionistic Type Theory.

A general schema for inductive families in Intuitionistic Type Theory was defined in [Dybjer91](#Dybjer91), [Dybjer94](#Dybjer94). This general schema was based on Martin-L&#246;f's 1971 schema for inductive definitions in predicate logic. Simultaneously, [Coquand](#CoquandPaulin) and [Paulin](#Paulin93) extended the Calculus of Constructions with a similar schema for inductive families. This resulted in the [[calculus of inductive constructions]].

[Dybjer](#Dybjer2000) and [Dybjer and Setzer](#DybjerSetzer2001) generalized this schema to inductive-recursive definitions, resulting in "indexed induction-recursion".

[Dybjer and Setzer](#DybjerSetzer) also distinguish two kinds of inductive (and inductive-recursive) families, restricted (due to Coquand) and general ones. The identity type is an example of the latter, but not of the former.

Inductive families are part of the axiomatic foundation in [[Coq]] and [[agda]]. Instead, [[Lean]] does not have fix-point expressions, match expressions, or a termination checker in the kernel. Instead, recursive definitions and pattern matching are compiled into eliminators outside of the kernel.

## Semantics
Standard inductive types, [[W-types]] can be interpreted in any topos with [[natural numbers object]] (Moerdijk-Palmgren). Gambino and Hyland construct initial algebras for dependent [[polynomial functors]]. [Indexed containers](#AGHMM) are the same as dependent polynomial functors.
[Indexed containers](#AGHMM) are claimed to form a foundation for inductive families.

## Higher categorical version/ homotopy type theory
[van den Berg and Moerdijk](#vdBergMoerdijk13) show that (standard) W-types can be interpreted in certain [[model categories]].
In [[homotopy type theory]] with [[universes]], one can reduce indexed W-types to W-types. This has been formalized [here](https://github.com/pcapriotti/agda-base/blob/master/src/container/w/core.agda), [here](https://github.com/SkySkimmer/HoTTClasses/blob/inductives/theories/theory/inductives.v) and [here](https://github.com/jashug/IWTypes).
[Sattler](#Sattler) outlines a generalization of the reduction to [[homotopy type theory]] without the need of universes.
