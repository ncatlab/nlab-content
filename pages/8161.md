## Idea

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$,  then a **filtered object** is an [[object]] $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a _filtration_: 

A **descending filtration** or **decreasing filtrations** of $X$ is a sequence of [[morphisms]] (often required to be [[monomorphisms]]) of the form

  $$
    \cdots
     \longrightarrow
    X_{n+1}
     \longrightarrow
    X_n
     \longrightarrow
    X_{n-1}
      \longrightarrow
    \cdots
      \longrightarrow
    X
  $$


An **ascending filtration** or **increasing filtration** of $X$ is of the form

  $$
    X 
      \longrightarrow
    \cdots
      \longrightarrow
    X_{n-1}
      \longrightarrow
    X_n
      \longrightarrow
    X_{n+1}
      \longrightarrow
    \cdots
  $$

FuIn situations where quotients make sense, extra conditions on the quotients $X_{(n)}/X_{(n+1)}$, are often imposed; see [[associated graded object]]. 

(In more generality, it is also possible to index using any [[ordered group|ordered abelian group]].)

A decreasing filtration $\{X_s\}_s$ of $X$ is called

* **exhaustive** if $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_s X_s \simeq X$ ($X$ is the [[colimit]]) of the filter stages)

* **Hausdorff** if $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_s X_s \simeq \emptyset$ (the [[limit]] of the the filter stages is [[initial object|empty]] ([[zero object|zero]] in the case of an [[abelian category]]))

and for a filtration of [[abelian groups]]:

* **complete** if $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^1_s X_n = 0$ (also the first [[derived functor|derived]] [[limit]] ([[lim^1]]) vanishes)

([Boardman 99, def. 2.1](#Boardman99), see also [Rognes 12, section 2.1](#Rognes12))

Often exhaustiveness is understood by default, and often it is even assumed by default that $X_s = X$ for $s \leq 0$.
