## Idea

Continuous logic is a logic whose truth values can take continuous values in $[0,1]$. The main variant used in model theory is motivated by the model theory of Banach spaces and similar structures. The language has connectives for each continuous function $c: [0,1]^n \to [0,1]$ and the quantifiers are interpreted as infimum and supremum. The models of this logic are bounded complete metric structures equipped with uniformly continuous maps and $[0,1]$-valued predicates. 

As well as satisfying a form of [[completeness theorem]], 

>...continuous first-order logic satisfies suitably phrased forms of the compactness theorem, the L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem  theorems, the diagram arguments, Craig's interpolation theorem, Beth's definability theorem, characterizations of quantifier elimination and model completeness, the existence of saturated and homogeneous  models results, the omitting types theorem, fundamental results of stability theory, and nearly all other results of elementary model theory. ([Yaacov &amp; Pedersen 10](#YaacovPed10))

## In terms of enriched category theory

Building on the proposal of [[Lawvere]] to understand a form of [metric space](metric+space#LawvereMetricSpace) as a category [[enriched category theory|enriched]] in the [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[poset]] $([0, \infty], \geq)$, there have been attempts to consider continuous logic as a similarly enriched logic. In ([Albert &amp; Hart](#AlbertHart)), the authors develop a parallel for [[conceptual completeness]] via the notion of a *metric* [[pretopos]].

[[Simon Cho]] argues that the object of truth values of continuous logic, $[0,1]$, should be seen as a "continuous subobject classifier" in a similar sense to the [[subobject classifier]] of topos theory where subobjects are classified via [[pullbacks]] ([Cho 19](#Cho19)).
