## Idea

*Concurrency* (or maybe rather _parallelism_ ([Harper](#Harper))) is a joint property of several (maybe interacting) [[event structure|processes]] proceeding simultaneously. Here the word "simultaneously" indicates that the evolution of the participating processes is indexed along an irreversible [[directed object]].
