## Idea

Categorical compositional distributional semantics, also known as **DisCoCat** for short, uses category theory to combine the benefits of two very different approaches to [[linguistics]]: [[categorial grammar]] and [distributional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics). Specifically, it uses the fact that [[categorial grammar|pregroups]] and the category of finite-dimensional real [[vector space|vector spaces]] are both examples of [[compact closed category|compact closed categories]]. It turns out that word meanings can be arranged into a strong [[monoidal functor]], which allows sentence meanings to be computed from word meanings by linear algebra, compositionally on the grammatical structure of the sentence.

DisCoCat was first introduced in [Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark 2010](#Coecke10).

There is a curious (if probably shallow) analogy between DisCoCat and [[topological quantum field theory]], in that both concern strong monoidal functors from a free compact closed category to a category of vector spaces.

## Simple example

Consider a very simple fragment of English consisting of nouns and verbs. Write $n$ for the type of nouns, and $s$ for the type of sentences. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the free pregroup generated by $n$ and $s$. In $\mathcal{C}$, a noun will be assigned the type $n$ and a reflexive verb will be assigned the type $n^{r} s n^{l}$, since it will produce a sentence if provided with nouns on the left and right. Now given nouns such as "Alice" and "Bob" and reflexive verbs such as "loves" and "hates", the grammaticality of a sentence such as "Alice hates Bob" is witnessed by the fact that
\[ n n^{r} s n^{l} n \leq s \]
in the free pregroup.

A strong monoidal functor $F : \mathcal{C} \to FVect_{\mathbb{R}}$ is completely determined by where it sends the generators $n$ and $s$. The vector spaces $F (n)$ and $F (s)$ are called the _noun space_ and the _sentence space_, and their choice is a matter of linguistic modelling. A common approach is to pick a large set $n$ of _basis words_, say $n = 1000$ (or as many as your sparse matrix implementation can handle), and take $F (n) = \mathbb{R}^{1000}$. The choice of $F (s)$ is not well understood, but $F (s) = \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a common choice, with the standard basis vectors interpreted as "true" and "false".

Given a grammatical parsing such as $n n^{r} s n^{l} n \leq s$, we automatically get a linear map
\[ F (n n^{r} s n^{l} n) : F (n) \otimes F (n) \otimes F (s) \otimes F (n) \otimes F (n) \to F (s) \]
given by appropriate tensor contractions.

The final ingredient we need are _word vectors_. We need to pick vectors $[\![ Alice ]\!], [\![ Bob ]\!] \in F (n)$ and $[\![ loves ]\!] \in F (n) \otimes F (s) \otimes F (n)$. The choice of these vectors is also a matter for linguistics, but a common idea is to count how often Alice (for example) appears in a corpus (for example the full text of Wikipedia) close to each of the chosen basis words.

Finally, we obtain a sentence-vector
\[ F (n n^{r} s n^{l} n \leq s) ([\![ Alice ]\!] \otimes [\![ loves ]\!] \otimes [\![ Bob ]\!]) \in F (s) \]

## Relative pronouns and Frobenius algebras

## Free pregroups vs free autonomous categories

All earlier papers on DisCoCat use free pregroups for the grammar category, building on earlier work by [[Joachim Lambek]] on pregroup grammars. Unfortunately, in [Preller 2014, fact 1](#Preller14) it is proven that any strong monoidal functor from a free pregroup to $FVect$ is necessarily trivial, in the sense that it sends every generator to the monoidal unit $\mathbb{R}$. This is worked around by using a free [[autonomous category]] instead of a free pregroup (this is a sort of [[categorification]]). Morphisms in the free autonomous category can be viewed as [[proof relevance|proof relevant]] grammatical reductions.

This allows a slightly more elegant reformulation of our basic example. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the free autonomous category on the objects $n, s$ and the morphisms $Alice : 1 \to n$, $Bob : 1 \to n$ and $loves : 1 \to n^{r} s n^{l}$. Then a sentence such as "Alice loves Bob", together with its grammaticality, is witnessed by a morphism $f : 1 \to s$. Now the word-vectors $[\![ Alice ]\!] = F (Alice)$, $[\![ Bob ]\!] = F (Bob)$ and $[\![ loves ]\!] = F (loves)$ become part of the data defining $F : \mathcal{C} \to FVect$, and the resulting sentence vector is simply $F (f)$.

## Variations

DisCoCat is relatively easy to modify by replacing the semantic category $FVect$ with some other category with the appropriate structure. Examples include

* [[relation|Relations]] to model simple boolean semantics, usually as a simpler toy model

* [[density matrix|Density matrices]] to model semantic ambiguity (such as "financial bank" vs "river bank"

* Convex relations (i.e. [[relation|relations]] in the category of [[convex space|convex spaces]]) to model cognition ([Bolt et al 2016](#Bolt16))

* Formulas of [[regular logic]] to model [[Montague grammar|Montague semantics]] ([Felice, Meichanetzidis and Toumi 2019](#Felice19))

* [[game theory|Games]] to model dialogue ([Hedges and Lewis 2018](#Hedges18))
