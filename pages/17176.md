## Idea

The _Adams category_, named after ([Adams 74](#Adams74)) was historically one of the first constructions of the [[stable homotopy category]]. It is defined to be the category of [[CW-spectra]] together with [[left homotopy|left]] [[homotopy classes]] (via [[cylinder spectra]]) of "eventually defined" functions between them.

## References

The definition is due to

* {#Adams74} [[Frank Adams]], Part III, section 2 of _[[Stable homotopy and generalised homology]]_, 1974

The term "Adams category" for this starts to be used for instance in 

* [[Harold Hastings]], _On function spectra_, Proceedings of the AMS, volume 44, Number 1, May 1974 ([pdf](http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1974-044-01/S0002-9939-1974-0343258-4/S0002-9939-1974-0343258-4.pdf))
