## Idea

The **nerve theorem** asserts that the [[homotopy type]] of a sufficiently nice [[topological space]] is encoded in the [[Cech nerve]] of a [[good cover]].

This can be seen as a special case of some aspects of [[étale homotopy]] as the étale homotopy type of nice spaces coincides with the homotopy type of its Cech nerve.

## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact space]] and $\{U_i \to X\}$ a [[good open cover]]. Write $C(\{U_i\})$ for the [[Cech nerve]] of this cover

$$
  C(\{U_i\}) = \left(
    \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}\coprod_{i,j} U_i \cap U_j \stackrel{\to}{\to} \coprod_{i} U_i
  \right)
  \,,
$$

(a [[simplicial object|simplicial]] [[space]]) and write 

$$
  \tilde C(\{U_i\}) = \left(
    \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}\coprod_{i,j} * \stackrel{\to}{\to} \coprod_{i} *
  \right)
$$

for the [[simplicial set]] obtained by replacing in $C(\{U_i\})$ each [[direct sum]]mand space by the [[point]]. Let $|\tilde C(\{U_i\})|$ be the [[geometric realization]]. 

This is [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to $X$.

This is usually attributed to ([Borsuk1948](#Borsuk)). The proof relies on the existence of [[partitions of unity]] (see for instance the review [Hatcher, prop. 4G.2](#Hatcher)).

###### Remark

This statement implies that in the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] [[ETop∞Grpd]] the intrinsic [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] coincides with the ordinary [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] functor of [[paracompact topological spaces]]. See <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Euclidean-topological+infinity-groupoid#GeometricHomotopy">Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoid : Geometric homotopy</a> for details.
