## Idea

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]], [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] is an [[extension of distributions|extension]] of [[time-ordered products]], uniquely defined away from coinciding spacetime arguments, to the locus of coinciding spacetime arguments. Before the extension these [[time-ordered products]] may generally enjoy further properties beyond the [[causal factorization]] that characterizes them as time-ordered products. Not all these properties necessarily need to be preserved by a choice of [[extension of distributions]] to coinciding spacetime arguments. A _renormalization condition_ is the condition that some such properties ought to be preserved by the choice of [[renormalization|("re-")normalization]].

The [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] holds true if at least the renormalization conditions "field independence" and "translation equivariance" are imposed. Depending on how many other renormalization conditions are imposed, the resulting [[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]] becomes smaller. ([Duetsch 18, remark 3.102](#Duetsch18))

Besides "field indepence" and "translation invariance" a key renormalization condition for [[gauge theories]] is the _[[quantum master equation]]_ or quivalently _[[master Ward identity]]_. If this renormalization condition cannot be satisfied, one says that the corresponding [[perturbative QFT]] does not exist due to a "[[gauge anomaly]]". ([Dütsch 18, section 4.2](#Duetsch18))
