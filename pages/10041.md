## Idea

What is called _Verdier duality_  is the refinement of [[Poincaré duality]] from [[ordinary cohomology]] to [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]. 
The Grothendieck [[six operations]] formalism is a formalization of aspects of Verdier duality.

In general abstract formulation one says that a locally compact [[site]] $X$ (e.g. a [[locally compact topological space]]) _satisfies Verdier duality_ if there exists a [[derived functor|derived]] [[right adjoint]] $\mathbb{L}p^!$ ([[exceptional inverse image]]) to the operation $\mathbb{R}p_!$ of [[direct image with compact support]] for the terminal map $X \to \ast$. More generally, in the relative situation, for $f \colon X \to Y$ a map, Verdier duality of $f$ means that $\mathbb{R}f_!$ has a derived right adjoint. If here $X$ is a [[scheme]] and $f_! \simeq f_\ast$ coincides with the [[direct image]] ("[[Grothendieck context]]") then this is called _[[Grothendieck duality]]_. Therefore one often speaks of _Verdier-Grothendieck duality_. 



If these adjoints exist, then one has the _[[dualizing object in a closed category]]_ ([[dualizing module]]) $\omega \coloneqq \mathbb{L}p^! k$ (the image under the extra right adjoint of the [[unit object]]) and for every [[abelian sheaf]] $V$ on $X$ can define the [[dual object in a closed category]] 

$$
  \mathbb{D}V \coloneqq [V,\omega]
  \,.
$$ 

The analog of [[Poincaré duality]] is then the statement that the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $V$ is dual to the abelian sheaf cohomology with [[compact support]] with coefficients in $\mathbb{D}V$.


## Implementations

A fairly general class of implementations of Verdier-Grothendieck duality is discussed in ([Joshua, theorem 1.3](#Joshua)).

With assumption ([Joshua, 4.3](#Joshua)) this derives that dualization intertwines the two pushforwards as $\mathbb{D} \circ f_\ast \simeq f_! \circ \mathbb{D}$ ([Joshua, corollary 5.4](#Joshua)).
