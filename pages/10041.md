## Idea

The analog of [[Poincaré duality]] in [[derived category|derived]] [[abelian sheaf|abelian]] [[sheaf and topos theory]].

Verdier duality on a [[morphism]] $f$ in a [[derived category]] of [[abelian sheaves]] is the existence of a [[derived functor|derived]] [[left adjoint]] $\mathbb{L}f^!$ to the operation $\mathbb{R}f_!$ of [[direct image with compact support]].

The Grothendieck [[six operations]] formalism is a formalization of aspects of Verider duality.
