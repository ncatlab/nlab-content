#Definition#

In the context of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] a [[spectrum]] is a [[spectrum object]] in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] $Top_*$ of pointed [[topological space]]s.

Recall that [[spectrum object]]s in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] $C$ form a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $Sp(C)$.

The [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[spectrum object]]s in $Top_*$ is the **stable $(\infty,1)$-category of spectra**

$$
  Stab(Top) := Sp(Top_*)
  \,.
