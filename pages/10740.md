## Idea

_Hopf invariant one_ refers to [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]] between [[spheres]] of the form

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; S^{2n-1} \longrightarrow S^n
  \,,
$$

hence to elements in the [[homotopy groups of spheres]]

$$
  [\phi] \in \pi_{2n-1}(S^n)
$$

whose [[Hopf invariant]] is equal to one:

$$
  h(\phi) = 1
  \,.
$$



## Properties

### Relation to H-space structure and normed division algebras
 {#RelationToHSpaceStructureAndNormedDivisionAlgebras}

The existence of an element of Hopf invariant one in $\pi_{2n-1}(S^n)$
is equivalent to the existence of an [[H-space]] structure on $S^n$.

A celebrated theorem due to ([Adams 60](#Adams60), introducing and using the [[Adams spectral sequence]])  states that maps of Hopf invaraint one correspond precisely to the the [[Hopf constructions]] on the four [[normed division algebras]] (see also at [[Hurwitz theorem]]).

## History

> [[stable homotopy theory|Stable homotopy theory]] emerged as a distinct branch of [[algebraic topology]] with [[John  Adams|Adams]]' introduction of [[Adams spectral sequence|his eponymous spectral sequence]] and his spectacular conceptual use of the notion of stable phenomena in his solution to the Hopf invariant one problem.
