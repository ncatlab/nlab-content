A __pseudocompact ring__ is a complete Hausdorff
[[topological ring]], $R$, which admits a base at $0$ of two-sided open ideals $I$ for each of which $R/I$ is an Artinian ring. Equivalently, it is a regular [[pro-object]] in Artinian rings. 

More generally let $R$ be a commutative pseudocompact ring. A complete Hausdorff topological ring $\Lambda$ will be called a __pseudocompact algebra__ over $R$ if

(i)  $\Lambda$ is an $R$ algebra in the usual sense, and 

(ii) $\Lambda$ admits a system of open neighbourhoods of 0 consisting of two-sided ideals $I$ such that $\Lambda/I$ has finite length as an $R$ module.

##Motivations and applications


1. Grothendieck developed the theory of [[formal group]]s over pseudocompact rings. 

1. The completed [[group algebra]]s of [[profinite group]]s are naturally pseudocompact algebras, usually considered over finite fields or the [[profinite completion]] of the ring of integers.
