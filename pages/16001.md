## Idea

The motivation of generalized global analytic geometry is to define analytic spaces associated to rig categories, and to use their relations with classical [[global analytic geometry|global analytic spaces]] in order to properly define [[Arakelov models]] of [[arithmetic varieties]] in an analytic setting.

Since rig categories are categorical analogs of associative and commutative semi-rings, a proper theory for them can only be given in the setting of $\infty$-categories.

One will thus define [[overconvergent global analytic geometry|overconvergent global analytic spaces]] of power series over a given stable rig $\infty$-category, rational domains in them, and compare the associated $G$-topology with the usual $G$-topology of overconvergent analytic geometry. Generalizing directly Haran's definition of the rig of integers of $(\mathbb{R},|\cdot|_\infty)$, we will then give examples of non-stable rig $\infty$-category with a well defined notion of rig $\infty$-category of analytic functions, and use them to define natural Arakelov-type compactifications of strict overconvergent global analytic spaces over $(\mathbb{Z},|\cdot|_\infty)$.

In the particular case of $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{Z})$, we will get a natural proper $G$-topological space $\overline{\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{Z})}$ together with a rig category $\mathcal{O}$ of overconvergent analytic functions, whose global sections are given by the rig category $\mathbb{F}_{\{\pm 1\}}$. This gives convincing indications that strict global analytic spaces may be naturally thought of as Arakelov models of the corresponding schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$. Since these new compactified spectra are stable by the natural power flow $|\cdot|\mapsto |\cdot|^t$ for $t\in [0,+\infty]$, they may be useful to better understand the relations between overconvergent global analytic geometry and analytic number theory (in the adelic sense of Tate's thesis).
