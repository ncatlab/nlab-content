A stable $\infty$-category is an [[∞-category]] whose [[objects]] behave like homotopy-theoretic [[spectra]].

A detailed theory for stable $\infty$-categories exists for the case of [[(∞,1)-categories]]:
see [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

This type of stability is not to be confused with being stably (or symmetric) [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|monoidal]].
