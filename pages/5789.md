## Idea

Where a system of [[quantum mechanics]] is specified by

* a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$;

* a [[hermitean operator]] $H$  on $\mathcal{H}$ -- the [[Hamiltonian]];

a system of _supersymmetric quantum mechanics_ has 

* a [[super Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$;

* an odd operator $D$ in $\mathcal{H}$, the [[supercharge]]

* such that $D \circ D = H$ is the [[Hamiltonian]].

If we regard the Hamiltonian as the generator of the [[Poincare Lie algebra]] in one dimension, then the graded commutator $[D,D] = 2 H$ is the [[supersymmetry]] extension to the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]].

The data of a system of supersymmetric quantum mechanics may also be formalized in terms of a [[spectral triple]].

Supersymmetric quantum mechanics gained attention with the work

* [[Edward Witten]], _Supersymmetry and Morse theory_  J. Differential Geom. Volume 17, Number 4 (1982), 661-692. ([Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437492))

which was part of what gained Witten the [Field medal 1990](http://159.226.47.99:8080/general/prize/medal/1990.htm). In this article a certain family of deformations of [[superparticles]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] are considered and the supersymmetric ground states are shown to be given by the [[Morse theory]] of the deformation function. 

This deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics arises as the point-particle limit of the [[type II superstring]] regarded as [[quantum mechanics]] on the [[loop space]], a relation that is stated more explicitly at the end of

The relationon between the 2d [[SCFT]] describing the [[type II superstring]] and this deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics on loop space has been further explored in
