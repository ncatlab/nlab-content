__Composition__ is the operation that takes [[morphism|morphisms]] $f: x \to y$, $g: y \to z$ in a [[category]] and produces a morphism $g \circ f: x \to z$, called the __composite__ of $f$ and $g$.


## Notation ##

Traditionally, the composite is written $g \circ f$, following the notation introduced by the followers of Leibniz for composition of [[function]]s. This can be abbreviated as simply $g f$. On the other hand, reading a diagram
$$ x \stackrel{f}\to y \stackrel{g}\to z $$
the notation $f g$ reads better. One way to make this anti-Leibniz convention clearer is to write $f ; g$ (which is based on the interpretation of programming commands as morphisms in theoretical computer science).

So the notations $g f$ and $f g$ are ambiguous, while $g \circ f$ and $f ; g$ are less so.
