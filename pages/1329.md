## Idea

The _hypercompletion_ ([Lurie](#Lurie)) or _$t$-completion_ ([Rezk](#Rezk), [ToënVezzosi](#ToenVezzosi)) of an [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-sheaves]] is a further localization/[[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-sheafification]] which corresponds to retaining only those [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] which satisfy [[descent]] with respect to all [[hypercover]]s.

## Definition

###### Definition

An [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-sheaves]] is a **[[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]]**  if every $\infty$-[[n-connective|connective]] morphism is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]].

###### Remark

This may be read as saying that the [[Whitehead theorem]] is valid in the [[(∞,1)-topos]].

## Examples

* The $(\infty,1)$-category defined by the Joyal-Jardine [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]] with weak equivalences those morphisms that induce isomorphisms on homotopy sheaves is the hypercompletion of the [[localization]] of simplicial presheaves at ordinary covers. For more details see [[descent for simplicial presheaves]].
