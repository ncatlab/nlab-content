This entry illustrates by way of examples the concepts of categorical [[limit]] and [[colimit]], hence also in particular of [[product]] and [[coproduct]]. 

It starts with very elementary and simple examples and eventually passes to more sophisticated ones.

# Limits and colimits in Set #

In the [[category]] [[Set]] of [[set]]s, [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s reduce to the very familiar operations of 

* cartesian product of sets

* disjoint union of sets

* sets of equivalence classes.

Conversely, [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s in other categories may be regarded as generalizations of these concepts to things other than plain sets.

A web-based program that generates componentwise illustrations of simple [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s in [[Set]] is developed at
