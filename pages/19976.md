## Idea

In [[quantum chromodynamics]], in fact already in pure [[special unitary group|SU(3)]] [[Yang-Mills theory]], a _glueball_ is a [[bound state]] of (just) [[gluons]] (a kind of [[confinement]]).

Glueballs are hard to detect in [[experiment]] but their existence is confirmed by [[lattice QCD]], also by the [[AdS-QCD correspondence]] (see there). According to [Greensite 11, section 8.5](#Greensite11):

> The [[caloron]] idea is probably the most promising current version of [[monopole]] [[confinement]] in pure non-abelian gauge theories, but it is  basically  (in certain [[gauge fixing|gauges]]) a superposition of [[monopoles]] with spherically  symmetric abelian fields, and this leads to the same questions raised in connection with monopole Coulomb gases.
