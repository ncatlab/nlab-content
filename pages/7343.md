## Idea

The special case of [[super Yang-Mills theory]] over a [[spacetime]] of [[dimension]] 4 and with $N = 2$ [[supersymmetry]].

## Properties

### Moduli space of vacua
 {#ModuliSpacesOfVacua}

A speciality of $N=2$, $D = 4$ SYM is that its [[moduli space]] of [[vacua]] has two "branches" called the _[[Coulomb branch]]_ and the _[[Higgs branch]]_. This is the content of what is now called _[[Seiberg-Witten theory]]_ ([Seiberg-Witten 94](#SeibergWitten94)). Review includes ([Albertsson 03, section 2.3.4](#Albertsson03)).

### Confinement

While [[confinement]] in plain [[Yang-Mills theory]] is still waiting for mathematical formalization and [[proof]] (see [Jaffe-Witten](confinement#JaffeWitten)), N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory is has been obsrved in ([Seiberg-Witten 94](#SeibergWitten94)).


### Reduction to $D = 3$ super Yang-Mills

By [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|dimensional reduction]] on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ families of $N = 2, D = 4$ SYM theories interpolate to [[N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills theory]]. ([Seiberg-Witten 96](#SeibergWitten96)).

### Construction by compactification of 5-branes
 {#ConstructionByCompactificationOf5Branes}

$N=2$ super Yang-Mills theory can be realized as the [[worldvolume]] theory of [[M5-branes]] [[Kaluza-Klein compactification|compactified]] on a [[Riemann surface]] ([Klemm-Lerche-Mayr-Vafa-Warner 96](#KlemmLercheMayrVafaWarner96), [Witten 97](#Witten97), [Gaiotto 09](#Gaiotto09)), hence as a compactifiction of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the M5. This in particular gives a geometric interpretation of [[Seiberg-Witten duality]] in 4d in terms of the 6d 5-brane geometry.

Specifically the _[[AGT correspondence]]_ expresses this relation in terms of the [[partition function]] of the theory and a [[2d CFT]] on the [[Riemann surface]] on which the 5-brane is compactified. See at _[[AGT correspondence]]_ for more on this.

### Construction from 5-branes
 {#ReferencesConstructionFrom5Branes}

$N=2$ $D=4$ SYM including its [[Seiberg-Witten theory]] ([Seiberg-Witten 94](SeibergWitten94)) may be understood as being the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[worldvolume]] of [[M5-branes]] on a [[Riemann surface]]: the Riemann surface is identified with the _Seiberg-Witten curve_ of complexified coupling constants. This observation goes back to

* A. Klemm, [[Wolfgang Lerche]], P. Mayr, [[Cumrun Vafa]], N. Warner, _Self-Dual Strings and N=2 Supersymmetric Field Theory_ ([arXiv:hep-th/9604034](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9604034))
 {#KlemmLercheMayrVafaWarner96}

* [[Edward Witten]], _Solutions Of Four-Dimensional Field Theories Via M Theory_ ([arXiv:hep-th/9703166](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9703166)) 
 {#Witten97}


The further observation that therefore the sewing of [[Riemann surfaces]] on which one compactifies the M5-brane yields a gluing operation on N=2 SYM theories is due to

* [[Davide Gaiotto]], _N=2 dualities_ ([arXiv:0904.2715](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2715))
 {#Gaiotto09}

The [[topologically twisted D=4 super Yang-Mills theory|topological twisting]] of the compactification which is used around (2.27) there was previously introduced in section 3.1.2 of

* [[Davide Gaiotto]], [[Gregory Moore]] and [[Andrew Neitzke]], _Wall-crossing, Hitchin Systems, and the WKB Approximation_, ([arXiv:0907.3987](http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3987))

and is discussed also for instance in section 5.1 of 

* [[Edward Witten]], _Fivebranes and knots_ ([arXiv:1101.3216](http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3216))

(This is possibly also the mechanism behind the [[AGT correspondence]], though the details obehind that statement seem to be unclear.)

A brief review of these matters is in ([Moore 12, section 7](#Moore12)). A formalization of the [[topological twist]] in  [[perturbation theory]] formalized by [[factorization algebras]] with values in [[BV complexes]] is in section 16 of

* [[Kevin Costello]], _Notes on supersymmetric and holomorphic field theories in dimensions 2 and 4_ ([arXiv:1111.4234](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4234))
 {#Costello11}

For more on this see at _[[topologically twisted D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]_.

 
  

An amplification of the relevance of this to the understanding of [[S-duality]]/[[electric-magnetic duality]] is in

* [[Edward Witten]], _[[Conformal field theory in four and six dimensions]]_, in [[Ulrike Tillmann]] (ed.) _Topology, geometry and quantum field theory_ LMS Lecture Note Series (2004) ([arXiv:0712.0157](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0157))
 {#Witten07}

and the resulting relation to the [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] is discussed in 

* [[Edward Witten]], _Geometric Langlands From Six Dimensions_ ([arXiv:0905.2720](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2720))
 {#Witten09}.

The corresponding dual theory under [[AdS-CFT duality]] is discussed in

Discussion of construction of just [[N=1 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] this way is in
