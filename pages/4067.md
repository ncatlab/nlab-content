According to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], there are 18 countably infinite families and 26 _sporadic_ simple groups. The latter groups do not fit into any systematic classification, but there are a number of links between them. For example, the [[Monster group]] $M$, the largest of the sporadic groups, contains all but six of the other sporadic groups as subquotients.
