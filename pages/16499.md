## Idea

Given a [[site]], there is a [[model category]] structure on the category of [[cubical objects]] in the [[presheaf topos]] over that site, hence on the category of [[cubical set]]-valued [[presheaves]], such that at least the corresponding [[homotopy category]] is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to that of the corresponding local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] ([Jardine 03, theorem 71](#Jardine03)) (the latter being known to [[locally presentable (infinity,1)-category|present]] the [[(infinity,1)-topos]] over the given site).
