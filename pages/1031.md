## Definition

### Definition as a pullback 

In a category with an [[initial object]] $0$, the __kernel__ $ker(f)$ of a morphism $f:c\to d$ is the [[pullback]]
$$
  \array{
    ker(f)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    c &\stackrel{f}{\to}& d
  }
  \,.
$$

As $0$ is initial the map $0\to d$ in this diagram is unique. More precisely, the kernel is the object $ker(f)$ together with the kernel arrow $ker(f)\to c$. 

### Definition as an equalizer

In a [[category]] with a notion of [[zero morphism]]), [[generalized the|the]] **kernel** $ker(f)$ of a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ is, if it exists, the [[equalizer]] of $f$ and the zero morphism $0_{c,d}$.  (By a 'notion of zero morphism', we really mean that the category is [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[pointed sets]].)

### As a weighted limit 

In any category enriched over pointed sets, the kernel of a morphism $f:c\to d$ is the universal morphism $k:a\to c$ such that $f \circ k$ is the basepoint.  It is a [[weighted limit]] in the sense of [[enriched category theory]].  This applies in particular in any (pre)-[[additive category]].

This is a special case of the construction of [[generalized kernels]] in enriched categories.

### $ker$ as a representing object

Let $Ab$ be the category of abelian groups. It is a category with kernels. In an [[abelian category]] $A$, for every morphism $f: X\to Y$ in $A$ there is the [[subfunctor]] 

$$ker f : A^{op}\to Ab$$

of the representable functor $hom(-,X)$ defined on objects by

$$ (ker f)(Z) = ker(hom(Z,X)\to hom(Z,Y)). $$

It follows that $ker f$ is also representable with representing object $Ker f$. One has to be careful with $Coker f$ which does not represent naive  $coker f$ defined as $(coker f)(Z) = coker(hom(Z,X)\to hom(Z,Y))$ in $Ab$,
which is often not representable at all, but is rather defined by the double dualization using the kernel in $Ab$: $Coker f = (Ker f^{op})^{op}$.

### In an $(\infty,1)$-category 

The kernel of a morphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] with $\infty$-categorical [[zero object]] is the [[homotopy pullback]] as in the pullback definition above: the [[homotopy fiber]]. 

See also [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

### Other meanings 

In some fields, the term 'kernel' refers to an [[equivalence relation]] that category theorists would see as a [[kernel pair]].  This is especially important in fields such as [[monoid]] theory where both notions exist but are not equivalent (while in [[group]] theory they are equivalent).

In [[ring]] theory, even when one assumes that rings have units preserved by ring homomorphisms, the traditional notion of kernel (an [[ideal]]) exists in the category of non-unital rings (and is not itself a unital ring in general).  A purely category-theoretic theory of unital rings can be recovered either by using the kernel pair instead or (to fit better the usual language) moving to a category of [[modules]].

In [[universal algebra]], this may be handled in the framework of [[Malcev variety|Malʹcev varieties]].

###### Proposition

In a category $C$ with [[pullback]]s and [[pushout]]s and [[zero object]], kernel and [[cokernel]] form a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s on the [[arrow category|arrow categories]]

$$
  (coker \dashv ker) : Arr(C) \stackrel{\overset{coker}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{ker}{\to}} Arr(C)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


We check the hom-isomorphism of a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s. An element in the [[hom-set]] $Arr_C(g,ker f)$ is a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     c &\to& ker(f) &\to& 0
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     d &\to& a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the universal property of the [[pullback]], this is the same as a diagram

$$
  \array{
     c  &\to& &\to& 0
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g}}\downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     d &\to& a &\stackrel{f}{\to}& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the dual reasoning, an element in $Arr_C(coker g, f)$ is a diagram

$$
  \array{
    c &\stackrel{g}{\to}& d &\to& a
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    0 &\to& coker g &\to& b
  }
  \,.
$$

By the universal property of the [[pushout]] this is equivalently a diagram

$$
  \array{
    c &\stackrel{g}{\to}& d &\to& a
    \\
    \downarrow &&  && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    0 &\to&  &\to& b
  }
  \,.
$$
