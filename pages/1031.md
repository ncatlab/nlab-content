#Definition#

In a [[category]] with [[zero object]] [[generalized the|the]] **kernel** $ker(f)$ of a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ is, if it exists, the [[equalizer]] of $f$ and the [[zero morphism]] from $c$ to $d$.

This is the same as the [[pullback]] of the [[zero object]] along $f$:

$$
  \array{
    ker(f)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    c &\to& d
  }
  \,.
$$

# Kernel in $\infty$-categories #

Accordingly, the kernel of a morphism in an [[infinity-category]] with $\infty$-categorical [[zero object]] is the [[homotopy pullback]] of the above kind.
