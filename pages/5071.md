##Polyhedron##
'Polyhedron' is used in various senses in Topology and Geometry.  Geometrically one has the following:

## Definition

A **polyhedron** is a 3-[[dimension]]al [[polytope]].

##'Polyhedra = polyhedral spaces'##

In classical algebraic topology, (e.g. in Spannier's book) there is another use for the term, more or less as an abbreviation for 'polyhedral space'.  In this sense, it is given by 

+--{: .un_defn}
######Definition######
A space $X$ is called a **polyhedron** if it has a [[triangulation]].
=--
This means that there will be a [[simplicial complex]], $K$ and a homeomorphism $f : |K|\to X$.
