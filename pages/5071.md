## Idea

The study of polyhedra has been one of the sources for methods and applications in algebraic topology, and it is often useful to go back to see the motivations and applications in the older sources.  For instance,  shape morphisms between polyhedral spaces are just homotopy classes of continuous maps so the Cech invariants of polyhedra coincide with their ordinary 'standard' invariants.     

## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is a **polyhedron** if it is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[geometric realization]] of a [[simplicial complex]] and hence has a [[triangulation]].
