## Idea

So-called Trimble rewiring refers to a certain type of transformation on graphs which were introduced in [Trimble's thesis](#TT94), intended to refine [[Kelly-Mac Lane graphs]] or classical proof nets in multiplicative [[linear logic]] so as to capture properties of the [[monoidal category|monoidal unit]] in [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal categories]]. These unit-extended proof nets may be interpreted as morphisms in free symmetric monoidal closed categories, and it turns out that two unit-extended proof nets are interpretable as the same morphism if and only if they are "rewiring equivalent". 

Rewirings can be organized into a confluent and strongly normalizing rewrite system, where a rewrite called "directed rewiring". The normal forms of graphs can then be used to state a full coherence theorem, extending the [[coherence theorem]] of [Kelly and Mac Lane](#KM71) for symmetric monoidal closed categories. 

The concept of rewiring equivalence extends to [[weakly distributive category|weakly distributive categories]] and $\ast$-[[star-autonomous category|autonomous]] categories as well, and likewise is used to give [coherence theorems](#BCST96) for these structures.
