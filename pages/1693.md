As a [[Boolean ring]] is a [[ring]] in which multiplication is [[idempotent]], so a Boolean rig is a [[rig]] in which multiplication is idempotent.

We need to add some more axioms here, but I\'m not sure what they are.  The 'Boolean semirings' in the literature (by which I mean, what Google found for me that wasn\'t cloaked) are something much more complicated than what I\'m looking for here.
