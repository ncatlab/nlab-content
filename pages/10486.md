## Idea

For $\mathbf{H}$ an [[∞-topos]] and for $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ an [[∞-group]] in $\mathbf{H}$, the higher analog of [[group cohomology]] of $G$ is the [[cohomology]] of the [[delooping]] object $\mathbf{B}G \in \mathbf{H}$.

Given a [[cocycle]] $\mathbf{B}G \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^{n+1} A$ in the $\infty$-group cohomology of $G$, then its [[homotopy fiber]] (the [[principal ∞-bundle]] over $\mathbf{B}G$ that it modulates) is the corresponding [[∞-group extension]].
