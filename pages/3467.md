Classical Galois extension refers to a class of extensions of fields.

An extension $K\subset L$ of [[field]]s is **Galois** if it is normal and [[separable field extension|separable]]. In that case, the automorphism group $Aut_K(L)$ of $K$-automorphisms of $L$ is called the Galois group and often denoted by $Gal(L:K)$. 

There is famous Galois theory for such extensions. 

Now there are numerous generalizations, including [[Hopf-Galois extension]]s, coalgebra Galois extensions etc.
