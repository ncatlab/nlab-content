## Definition

A __pointed set__ is a [[pointed object]] in [[Set]], hence a [[set]] $S$ equipped with a chosen element $s$ of $S$. (Compare [[inhabited set]], where the element is not specified.)

Since we can identify a (set-theoretic) element of $S$ with a (category-theoretic) [[global element]] (a morphism $s: 1 \to S$), we see that a pointed set is an object of the [[under category]] $\pt \downarrow \Set$, or coslice category $1/\Set$, of objects under the [[singleton]] $\{\bullet\}$.

## The category of pointed sets

### Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The [[category]] $Set_*$ of pointed sets is the [[under category]] $*/Set$ of [[Set]] under the singleton set.

=--


So a morphism $(S_1, s_1) \to (S_2, s_2)$ is a map between sets which maps these chosen elements to each other, i.e., commuting triangles

$$
  \array{
    && pt
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    S_1
    &&\to&&
    S_2
  }
 \,.
$$

The category $Set_*$ naturally comes with [[forgetful functor]] $p : Set_* \to Set$ which forgets the tip of these triangles.

### Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Equipped with the [[smash product]] $\otimes := \wedge$ of pointed set, $(Set_*, \wedge)$ is a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]].

The [[internal hom]] $Set_*(X,Y)$ is the [[hom-set]] in $*/Set$ pointed by the morphism $X \to Y$ that sends everything to the basepoint in $Y$.

=--

See at _[[pointed object]]_ for more details.



#### Interpretation as universal Set-bundle 

The morphism $Set_* \to Set$ is an example of a 
[[generalized universal bundle]]: the _universal [[Set]]-bundle_. 
The entire structure here can be understood as arising from the (strict) pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
    Set_* &\to& pt
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{pt \mapsto pt}
    \\
    [I,Set]
    &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}& Set
    \\
    \downarrow^{d_1}
    \\
    Set
  }
$$

in the 1-category [[Cat]], where

* $I = \{a \to b\}$ is the [[interval category]];

* $[I, Set] = Arr(Set)$ is the [[closed monoidal category|internal hom]] category which here is the [[arrow category]] of $Set$;

* $d_i := [j_i, Set]$ are the images of the two injections 
$j_i : pt \to I$ of the point to the left and the right end of the interval, respectively -- so these functors evaluate on the left and right end of the interval, respectively;

* the square is a pullback;

* the total vertical functor is the forgetful functor $p : Set_* \to Set$.

The way in which $Set_* \to Set$ is the "universal Set-bundle" is discussed pretty explicitly in

* Kathryn Hess, _[[HessLackBundCat.pdf:file]]_ .

(The discussion there becomes more manifestly one of bundles if one regards all morphisms $C \to Set$ appearing there as being the right legs of [[anafunctor]]s. )


#### Interpretation as 2-subobject-classfier

Observing that usual morphism into the [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ of the [[topos]] [[Set]] is the 
[[universal truth-value bundle]] 
$\{\top\} \to \TV$, and noticing that $TV = (-1)Cat$ and $Set = 0Cat$ suggests that $Set_* \to Set$ is a [[vertical categorification|categorified]] subobject classifier:
indeed, it is the subobject classifier in the [[2-topos]] [[Cat]].
