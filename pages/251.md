## Definition ##

A **double category** is an [[n-fold category]] for $n=2$, i.e., an [[internal category]] in [[Cat]].  Similarly, a **double groupoid** is an internal [[groupoid]] in [[Grpd]].

However, these definitions obscure the essential symmetry of the definition.  We think of a double category $D_1 \rightrightarrows D_0$ as having

* *objects*: the objects  of $D_0$
* *vertical arrows*: the morphisms of $D_0$
* *horizontal arrows*: the objects of $D_1$
* *squares* or *2-cells*: the morphisms of $D_0$.

We may picture a 2-cell in a double category as a square

$$
  \array{
    (x_0 \in Obj(D_0)) 
    &\stackrel{(f \in Mor(D_0))}{\to} &
    (x_1 \in Obj(D_0)) 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathllap{(\xi_0 \in Obj(D_1))}}
    &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\phi \in Mor(D_1))}}&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\xi_1 \in Obj(D_1))}}
    \\
    (y_0 \in Obj(D_0)) 
    &\underset{(f_g \in Mor(D_0))}{\to} &
    (y_1 \in Obj(D_0)) 
  }
  \,.
$$


The vertical and horizontal arrows both form categories (the "edge categories"), and the squares have two category structures which respect the edge category structures.  

Horizontal composition of these squares is given by the compositon in the ordinary [[category|categories]] $D_0$ and $D_1$, while vertical composition is given by the composition operation specified on $D_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} D_0$ by virtue of it being a [[category]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Cat]].


In particular, the *transpose* of a double category, which switches the vertical and horizontal arrows, is again a double category.


## Examples ##

* If $C$ is a 2-category, we have a double category $Sq(C)$ whose objects are those of $C$, both of whose types of morphisms are the morphisms in $C$, and whose squares are 2-cells in $C$ with their source and target both decomposed as a composite of two morphisms.  (These squares are sometimes called *quintets* $(\alpha,f,g,h,k)$ where $\alpha\colon f g \to h k$.)

  (In this example, the two edge categories coincide.  Double categories with this property are called **edge-symmetric**.)

* Since any 1-category can be regarded as a 2-category with only identity 2-cells, for any 1-category $C$ we have a double category $Sq(C)$ whose squares are the commutative squares in $C$.  

* Any 2-category can also be made into a double category in two more ways, by defining the vertical or horizontal morphisms to consist only of identities.  In this way 2-categories can be considered as a special case of double categories.

  In the other direction, any double category has two underlying 2-categories, consisting of the objects, the vertical (resp. horizontal) arrows, and the squares whose horizontal-arrow (resp. vertical-arrow) source and target are identities.  We call these its **vertical 2-category** and **horizontal 2-category**.

* Finally, we can also make a 2-category $C$ into a double category with the same objects, whose horizontal arrows are the morphisms of $C$, whose vertical arrows are the [[adjunctions]] in $C$, and whose 2-cells are [[mate]]-pairs of 2-cells in $C$.  Naturality properties of the mate correspondence are concisely expressed by the existence of this double category.

* There is a double category $Prof$ whose objects are (small) categories, whose vertical arrows are functors, whose horizontal arrows are [[profunctors]], and whose squares are natural transformations.  This double category is in fact an [[equipment]], as are many other similar ones (such as for [[enriched categories]]).

* Any topological space has a "homotopy double groupoid" whose objects are points, whose morphisms of both types are paths (so it is edge-symmetric), and whose 2-cells are homotopies.

* There is a double category $MonCat$ whose objects are [[monoidal categories]], whose horizontal arrows are [[lax monoidal functor]]s, whose vertical arrows are [[colax monoidal functor]]s, and whose 2-cells are generalized [[monoidal natural transformation]]s.  An analogous double category can be constructed involving the algebras for any [[2-monad]].

* There is a double category $Model$ whose objects are [[model categories]], whose horizontal arrows are right [[Quillen functor]]s, whose vertical arrows are left Quillen functors, and whose 2-cells are arbitrary natural transformations.  Passage to [[derived functors]] is a functor on this double category.


## Weakenings ##

An internal category in the 1-category $Cat$ is a *strict* double category, all of whose composition operations are strictly associative and unital.  However, since a double category is a 2-dimensional structure, it makes sense to allow these compositions to be weak as well.

A **pseudo double category** is a weakly internal category in the 2-category $Cat$.  Here "weakly internal category" in a 2-category is interpreted as being associative and unital up to coherent isomorphism, just as a [[bicategory]] is a "weakly enriched category."  This makes the composition in one direction weak, but the composition in the other direction remains strict (it is the composition in the objects of $Cat$ that make up the pseudo double category).  Many naturally occurring examples, such as $Prof$, are pseudo double categories.

Finally, a **[[double bicategory]]** is one way to define a double category which is "weak in both directions."
