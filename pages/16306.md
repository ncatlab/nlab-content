## Idea

In his _[[Science of Logic]]_ [[Georg Hegel]] makes a distinction between _subjective logic_, which involves _[[type|coneceps]]_, _[[judgements]]_ and _[[deduction]]_ (as usual for [[logic]]), and _objective logic_ which is concerned with something like the _[[logos]]_, a kind of [[ontology]] or [[metaphysics]], not unlike the ontological deductions of [[Spinoza's system]].

This _objective logic_ as presented by Hegel is hence rather unlike common [[predicate logic]], a fact that led to the rejection of this school of [[objective idealism]] by [[Bertrand Russell]] and the school of [[analytic philosophy]].

In ([Lawvere 94b](#Lawvere94b)) it is suggested that [[universal constructions]] in [[categorical logic]] and [[topos theory]], such as [[adjunctions]], should be thought of as the formal incarnation of Hegel's _objective logic_. Related suggestions are implicit in many of [[Lawvere]]'s writings, see at _[Lawvere -- Mathematics relating to philosophy](William+Lawvere#RelationToPhilosophy)_. Related commentary is in ([Rodin 14](#Rodin14)).
