## Quotes

> {#Witten21stCenturyQuote} Back in the early '70s, the Italian physicist, Daniele Amati reportedly said that [[string theory]] was part of 21st-century physics that fell by chance into the 20th century. I think it was a very wise remark. ([[Edward Witten]], [Nova interview 2003](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/view-witten.html), also [American Scientist Astronomy Issue 2002](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~witten/papers/string.pdf))
