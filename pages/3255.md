The **cellular approximation theorem** states that every [[continuous map]] between [[CW complexes]] (with chosen CW presentations) is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a [[cellular map]] (a map induced by a map of cell complexes). 

This is a CW analogue of the [[simplicial approximation theorem]] (sometimes also called lemma): that every continuous map between the geometric realizations of [[simplicial sets]] is homotopic to a map induced by a map of simplicial sets.
