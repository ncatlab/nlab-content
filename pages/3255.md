## Idea

The **cellular approximation theorem** states that every [[continuous map]] between [[CW complexes]] (with chosen CW presentations) is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a [[cellular map]] (a map induced by a map of cell complexes). 

This is a CW analogue of the [[simplicial approximation theorem]] (sometimes also called lemma): that every continuous map between the geometric realizations of [[simplicial complexes]] is homotopic to a map induced by a map of simplicial complexes (after subdivision).

###### Theorem 
Given a continuous map $f: (X, A) \to (X', A')$ between relative CW complexes that is cellular on a subcomplex $(Y, B)$ of $(X, A)$, there is a cellular map $g: (X, A) \to (X', A')$ that is homotopic to $f$ relative to $Y$.
