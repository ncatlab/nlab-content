## Idea

The discussion of the [[landscape of string theory vacua]] is often done with rather broad stroke approximations to the structures that should really be classified. For instance the landscape of [[flux compactifications]] is often done with all [[fluxes]] modeled simply as [[differential forms]]. It is known however that more properly these flux fields are really [[cocycles]] in [[differential cohomology]] (For instance the [[B-field]] is really in [[ordinary differential cohomology]] while the [[RR-field]] is really in [[differential K-theory]]). If one does take this refinement into account, then after [[KK-compactification]] what previously looked like plane [[scalar fields]] now become _[[axion]]_ fields, which inherit periodicity from their origin in [[higher gauge fields]]. Taking this [[axion|axionic]] nature of some of the scalar fields in string theory compactifications into account is hence known as considering the _axionic landscape_ of string theory vacua.
