## Definition
 {#Definition}

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $(E\to X)$ a smooth [[bundle]] over $X$, write $(Jet(E)\to X)$ for its [[jet bundle]].

For $(E_1 \to X)$, $(E_2 \to X)$
two [[bundles]] over $X$, then a _differential operator_ 

$$
  D \colon \Gamma_X(E_1) \to \Gamma_X(E_2)
$$ 

between their [[spaces of sections]] is a map of the form

$$
  \phi \mapsto \tilde D \circ j_\infty(\phi)
$$

where $j_\infty(\phi) \in \Gamma_X(Jet(E_1))$ is the jet prolongation of the section $\phi \in \Gamma_X(E_1)$, and where

$$
  \tilde D \colon Jet(E_1) \to E_2
$$

is a bundle morphism from the [[jet bundle]] of $E_1$ to the bundle $E_2$.

(e.g. [Krasil'shchikVerbovetsky 98, def. 1.1, prop. 1.1, prop. 1.9](#KrasilshchikVerbovetsky98))

Notice that (by the discussion there) the [[jet bundle]] construction $Jet \colon \mathbf{H}_{/X} \to \mathbf{H}_{/X}$ is a [[comonad]] on the category of bundles over $X$. In terms of this the above says that a differential operators from a bundle $E_1$ to a bundle $E_2$ is a morphism from $E_1$ to $E_2$ in the [[co-Kleisli category]] of the jet comonad.
