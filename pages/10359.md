## Idea

Given a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$ and given a [[Hamiltonian]] [[function]] $H \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$, there is a [[Poisson bracket]] on an [[algebra of functions]] on the [[smooth space|smooth]] [[path space]] $[I,X]$  -- the "space of histories" or "space of [[trajectories]]" -- for $I = [0,1]$ the closed [[interval]], which is such that its [[symplectic leaves]] are each a copy of $X$, but regarded as the space of initial conditions for evolution with respect to $H$ with a [[source]] term added.

The first statement was first observed for the [[Peierls bracket]] of [[local prequantum field theory]] in ([Marolf 93, section II](#Marolf93)), but the construction there is not specific to the [[Peierls bracket]]. That the construction provides a [[foliation]] of trajectory space by [[symplectic leaves]] labeled by [[sources]] was pointed out by ([Khavkine 13](#Khavkine13))

## On paths in a symplectic manifold

We describe here the off-shell Poisson bracket in the context of [[mechanics]], hence for [[mechanical systems]] with [[finite set|finite]]-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[phase space]]. The basic idea is that sketched in ([Marolf 93, section II](#Marolf93)), but we try to make it precise. Then we similarly look into the [[foliation]] by [[symplectic leaves]] as suggested by ([Khavkine 13](#Khavkine13)).

### The trajectory space of a symplectic manifold

Let $(X,\omega)$ be a [[symplectic manifold]]. We write 

$$
  \{-,-\} \;\colon\; C^\infty(X)\otimes C^\infty(X) \longrightarrow C^\infty(X)
$$

for the [[Poisson bracket]] induced by the [[symplectic form]] $\omega$, hence by the [[Poisson bivector]] $\pi \coloneqq \omega^{-1}$.

For notational simplicity we will restrict attention to the special case that 

$$
  X = \mathbb{R}^2 \simeq T^\ast \mathbb{R}
$$ 

with canonical [[coordinates]] 

$$
  q,p \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^2 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$ 

and symplectic form 

$$
  \omega = \mathbf{d}q \wedge \mathbf{d}p
  \,.
$$ 

The general case of the following discussion is a straightforward generalization of this, which is just notationally more inconvenient. 

Write $I \coloneqq [0,1]$ for the standard [[interval]] regarded as a [[smooth manifold]] [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]]. The [[mapping space]] 

$$
  P X \coloneqq [I, X]
$$

canonically exists as a [[smooth space]], but since $I$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] this structure canonically refines to that of a [[Fr√©chet manifold]] (see at _[[manifold structure of mapping spaces]]_). This implies that there is a good notion of [[tangent space]] $T P X$. The task now is to construct a certain [[Poisson bivector]] as a [[section]] $\pi \in \Gamma^{\wedge 2}(T P X)$.

Among the [[smooth functions]] on $P X$ are the [[evaluation maps]] 

$$
  ev \;\colon\; P X \times I = [I,X] \times I \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

whose components we denote, as usual, for $t \in I$ by

$$
  q(t) \coloneqq q \circ ev_t \;\colon\; P X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

and

$$
  p(t) \coloneqq p \circ ev_t \;\colon\; P X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

Generally for $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ any [[smooth function]], we write $f(t) \coloneqq f \circ ev_t \in C^\infty(P X)$. This defines an embedding

$$
  C^\infty(X) \times I \hookrightarrow C^\infty(P X)
  \,.
$$

Similarly we have 

$$
  \dot q(t) \;\colon\; P X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

and

$$
  \dot q(t) \;\colon\; P X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

obtained by [[differentiation]] of $t \mapsto q(t)$ and $t \mapsto p(t)$.

### Hamiltonian evolution

Let now 

$$
  H \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$ 

be a [[smooth function]], to be regarded as a [[Hamiltonian]]. For $t \in I$ write 

$$
  H(t) 
  \;\colon\;
  P X \times \{t\}
  \stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow}
  X 
  \stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}
$$

for its extension to trajectory space. 

Define then the [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange density]] induced by $H$ to be the functions

$$
  EL(t)
  \;\colon\;
  P X
  \longrightarrow 
  \mathbb{R}^2
$$

with components

$$
  EL(t)
  = 
  \left(
    \array{
      \dot q(t) - \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}(t)
      \\
      \dot p(t) + \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}(t)
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$


The [[trajectories]] $\gamma \colon I \to X$ on which $EL(t)$ vanishes for all $t \in I$ are equivalently those 

* for which the [[tangent vector]] $\dot \gamma \in T_{\gamma}X$ is a [[Hamiltonian vector field|Hamiltonian vector]] for $H$;

* which satisfy [[Hamilton's equations]] [[equations of motion|of motion]] for $H$.

Since the [[differential equations]] $EL = 0$ have a unique solution for given initial data $(q(0), p(0))$, the evaluation map

$$
  \left\{
    \gamma \in P X | \forall_{t \in I}\; EL_\gamma(t) = 0 
  \right\}
  \stackrel{\gamma \mapsto \gamma(0)}{\longrightarrow}
  X
$$

is an [[equivalence]] (an [[isomorphism]] of [[smooth spaces]]).


### The off-shell Poisson bracket
 {#TheOffShellPoissonBracketOnSpaceOfPathsInSymplecticManifold}

Write 

$$
  Poly(P X) \hookrightarrow C^\infty(P X)
$$

for the [[subalgebra]] of [[smooth functions]] on [[path space]] which are

* [[polynomials]] 

* of [[integrals]] over $I$

* of the smooth functions in the image of $C^\infty(X) \times I \hookrightarrow C^\infty(P X)$

* and all their [[derivatives]] along $I$.

Define a [[bilinear function]]

$$
  \{-,-\}
  \;\colon\;
  Poly(P X) \otimes Poly(P X)
  \longrightarrow Poly(P X)
$$

as the unique function which is a [[derivation]] in both arguments and moreover is a solution to the [[differential equations]]

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t_2}
  \left\{f(t_1), q(t_2)\right\}
  =
  \left\{
    f(t_1), \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}(t_2)
  \right\}
$$

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t_2}
  \left\{f(t_1), p(t_2)\right\}
  =
  -
  \left\{
    f(t_1), \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}(t_2)
  \right\}
$$

subject to the initial conditions

$$
  \{f(t), q(t)\} = \{f,q\}
$$

$$
  \{f(t), p(t)\} = \{f,p\}
$$

for all $t \in I$, where on the right we have the original [[Poisson bracket]] on $X$.

This bracket directly inherits skew-symmetry and the [[Jacobi identity]] from the [[Poisson bracket]] of $(X, \omega)$, hence equips the [[vector space]] $Poly(P X)$ with the structure of a [[Lie bracket]]. Since it is by construction also a [[derivation]] of  $Poly(P X)$ as an [[associative algebra]], we have that 

$$
  \left(
    Poly\left(P X\right),
    \;
    \left\{
      -,-
    \right\}
  \right)
  \;\;\;
  \in P_1 Alg
$$

is a [[Poisson algebra]]. This is the "off-shell Poisson algebra" on the space of [[trajectories]] in $(X,\omega)$.


### The symplectic leaves

Observe that by construction of the off-shell Poisson bracket, 
specifically by the [[differential equations]] defining it, the
[[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange function]] $EL$
generate a [[Poisson reduction|Poisson ideal]]. 

The same is true for $EL + J$, for $J \in C^\infty(I)$ any function of the (time) parameter. If we allow ourselves to consider time-dependent [[Hamiltonians]], then this corresponds to adding to the [[Hamiltonian]] $H$ a [[source]] term

$$
  H \mapsto H + J q
  \,.
$$

In the simple context of the above discussion we can still restrict attion to fully constant $J \in \mathbb{R}$ and find a foliation of parts of the off-shell Poisson geometry by symplectic leaves.
