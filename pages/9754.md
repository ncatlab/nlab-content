
* in [[quantum field theory]] and specifically [[gauge theory]]: a topological [[singularity]] in the [[vacuum]] structure caused by [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. 

  See at _[[QFT with defects]]_ for details of the general mechanism, and see at _[[domain wall]]_, _[[cosmic string]]_ and _[[monopole]]_ (also [[vortex]]) for (classes of) examples.
