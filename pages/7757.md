## Idea

Pretopos completion sends every [[coherent category]] into a pretopos, called its pretopos completion; the operation is idempotent. 
[[pretopos|Pretoposes]] form a full reflective sub-2-category of the 2-category of [[k-ary site|finitary site]]s.

According to the observation of [[Mihály Makkai]] from around 1980, the pretopos completion of the [[syntactic category]] of a [[first-order theory]] corresponds to the operation $T \mapsto T^{eq}$ invented by [[Saharon Shelah]]. $T^{eq}$ is a universal extension of $T$ which admits [[elimination of imaginaries]]. 

Given an [[arity class]] $\kappa$, there is a version $\kappa$-pretopos completion, see Shulman's paper.  The version $\kappa = \{1\}$ is the [[exact completion]].
