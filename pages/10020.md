## Idea

One incarnation of the [[holographic principle]] in [[quantum field theory]] is the correspondence between 3d $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] as the [[bulk field theory]] and the 2d [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]] on a suitable [[Lie group]] $G$ as the [[boundary field theory]]. This case stands out in that it was known and understood already before the [[holographic principle]] was formulated as such, motivated from [[bulk field theories]] of [[gravity]]. Notably the CS/WZW correspondence is an actual [[theorem]] instead of just a vague [[conjecture]], as for much of the [[AdS-CFT correspondence]].

Indeed, the natural equivalence between the [[space of quantum states]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] on a [[surface]] $\Sigma$ and the space of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[WZW model]] on $\Sigma$ was understood in the seminal article ([Witten 89](#Witten89)) and subsequently discussed in much detail, see also at [CS-theory -- References](Chern-Simons%20theory#References). The explicit holographic correspondence between the [[wavefunctions]] of Chern-Simons theory and the [[correlators]] of the WZW model is reviewed for instance in ([Gawędzki 99, around p. 30](#Gawedzki99)).
(This correspondence is captured [[functor|functorially]] by the notion of the [[modular functor]] of the 2d theory.)

For instance the [[FRS formalism]] _constructs_ all [[rational conformal field theories]] as full [[FQFTs]] holographically from the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] of the 3d Chern-Simons theory and fully classifies them this way.

Later the [[AdS-CFT correspondence]] came to be understood as a canonical or default implementation of the [[holographic principle]]. Here the [[bulk field theory]] is a theory of [[3d quantum gravity]] which is very much like traditional [[Chern-Simons theory]] but may crucially differ from it, see at _[[Chern-Simons gravity]]_ the [comments on the non-perturbative regime](Chern-Simons%20gravity#ProblemsInTheNonPerturbativeRegime). Instead some variant of CS3/WTW2 appears as one "sector" inside AdS3/CFT2, this is discussed in ([Gukov-Martinec-Moore-Strominger 04](#GukovMartinecMooreStrominger04)).

But notice that also plain [[Chern-Simons theory]] is a [[string theory]], but of [[topological strings]]. For more on this see at _[[TCFT]]_ the section _[Worldsheet and effective background theories](TCFT#ActionFunctionals)_.

A general argument that in sectors of the [[AdS-CFT correspondence]] the [[conformal blocks]] on the CFT-side are given just by the [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]-sector inside the dual [[gravity]] theory is in ([Witten98](#Witten98)). This applies notably to the duality between [[7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] and the conformal blocks in the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] on the [[M5-brane]].
