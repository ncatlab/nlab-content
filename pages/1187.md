#Idea#

The notion of [[compact object]] in an ordinary [[category]] is motivated by the example of [[Top]].  But as $Top$ is an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]], it should also make sense in that context.

#Definition#

The general definition has a bit of cumbersome fine print, see definition 5.3.4.5  in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]

It becomes simpler in [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categoris]]:

An object $X$ in a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] is **compact** if the $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  C(X,-) : C \to C
$$

commutes with all [[limit in quasi-categories|colimits]].


#Remarks#

* For more discussion of the relevance of compact objects, see also [[geometric infinity-function theory]].
