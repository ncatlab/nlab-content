## Idea

The notion of [[compact object]] in an ordinary [[category]] is motivated by the example of [[Top]].  But as $Top$ is an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]], it should also make sense in that context.

## Definition

(...)

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An object $X$ in a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] is **compact** if the $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  C(X,-) : C \to C
$$

commutes with all [[(∞,1)-colimits]].

## Properties

Let $\kappa$ be a [[regular cardinal]].

###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] which admits small 
$\kappa$-[[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]]. Then the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]]
of $\kappa$-compact objects in closed under $\kappa$-small [[(∞,1)-colimits]]
in $C$.
