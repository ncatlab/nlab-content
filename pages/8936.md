## Idea

In [[type theory]] what is called the _UIP axiom_, the axiom of _uniqueness of identity proofs_ is an [[axiom]] that when added to [[intensional type theory]] turns it into [[extensional type theory]].

The axiom asserts that any two [[terms]] of the same [[identity type]] 
$Id A(x,y)$ are themselves [[propositional equality|propositionally equal]] (in the corresponding higher identity type).

This is contrary to the [[univalence]] axiom, which makes sense only in the absence of UIP.

## Statement

$$
  UIP
  \colon
  \underset{A \colon Type}{\prod} 
  \underset{x,y \colon A}{\prod}
  \underset{p,q \colon Id_A(x,y)}{\prod}
  [ Id_{Id_A(x,y)}(p,q) ]
  \,.
$$
