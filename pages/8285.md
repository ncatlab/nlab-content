## Idea

Given a [[double complex]] $C_{\bullet, \bullet}$ (in some [[abelian category]]), there is a [[spectral sequence]] whose second page is the "na&iuml;ve double cohomology"

$$
  E^2_{p,q} = H_p^{vert}(H_q^{hor}(C))
$$

and which converges, under mild conditions, to the correct homology of the [[total complex]] $Tot(C_{\bullet, \bullet})$.

This is the special case of the [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] with $Tot(C)$ filtered by row-degree (or dually, by column-degree).

## Definition

Let $C_{\bullet,\bullet}$ be a [[double complex]]. Its [[total complex]] $Tot C$ is given in degree $n$ by the [[direct sum]]

$$
  (Tot C)_n = \oplus_{p+q = n} C_{p,q}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

The **horizontal filtration** on $Tot C$ is the [[filtered object|filtration]] $F_\bullet Tot C$ given in degree $n$ by the [[direct sum]] expression

$$
  F^{hor}_p (Tot C)_n \coloneqq  \oplus_{{k+l = n} \atop {k \leq p} } C_{k,l}
  \,.
$$

Similarly the **vertical filtration** is given by 

$$
  F^{vert}_p (Tot C)_n \coloneqq  
  \oplus_{{k+l = n} \atop {l \leq p} } C_{k,l}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

The (vertical/horizontal) _spectral sequence of the double complex_ $C_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] for the filtered total complex from def. \ref{HorVertFiltration}.

###### Remark


* $E^0_{p,q} = C_{p,q}$

* $E^1_{p,q} = H_q(C_{\bullet, p})$

* $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(H^{hor}_q(C))$

Details are usually discussed for the more general case of a _[[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]]_.
