# De Morgan duality
* table of contents

## Idea

In [[logic]], De Morgan duality is a [[duality]] between [[intuitionistic logic]] and dual-intuitionistic [[paraconsistent logic]].  In [[classical logic]] and [[linear logic]], it is a [[self-duality]] mediated by [[negation]].  Although it goes back to [[Aristotle]] (at least), its discovery is generally attributed to [[Augustus De Morgan]].


## The dualities

More explicitly, __De Morgan duality__ is the duality between logical operators as shown in the table below:

| Intuitionistic operator                  |   | Dual-intuitionistic operator               |
| ---------------------------------------- | - | ------------------------------------------ |
| $\top$ ([[truth]])                       |   | $\bot$ ([[falsehood]])                     |
| $\wedge$ ([[conjunction]])               |   | $\vee$ ([[disjunction]])                   |
| $\Rightarrow$ ([[conditional]])          |   | $\setminus$ ([[co-Heyting algebra|subtraction]])                  |
| $\Leftrightarrow$ ([[biconditional]])    |   | $+$ ([[exclusive disjunction]])            |
| $\neg$ ($p \Rightarrow \bot$)            |   | $-$ ($\top \setminus p$)                   |
| $\forall$ ([[universal quantification]]) |   | $\exists$ ([[existential quantification]]) |
| $\Box$ ([[necessity]])                   |   | $\lozenge$ ([[possibility]])               |

The first two operators in each column exist in both intuitionistic and dual-intuitionistic [[propositional logic]] and the last two in each column exist in both forms of [[predicate logic]] and [[modal logic]] (respectively), but they are still dual as shown.  All of these exist in [[classical logic]] (although some of the paraconsistent operators are not widely used), and the two forms of negation ($\neg$ and $-$) are the same there.

In [[linear logic]], this extends to a duality between conjunctive and disjunctive operators:

| Conjunctive operator |   | Disjunctive operator |
| -------------------- | - | -------------------- |
| $\top$               |   | $0$                  |
| $1$                  |   | $\bot$               |
| $\&$                 |   | $\oplus$             |
| $\otimes$            |   | $\parr$              |
| $^\bot$              |   | $^\bot$              |
| $\bigwedge$          |   | $\bigvee$            |
| $!$                  |   | $?$                  |

As with classical negation, linear [[negation]] is self-dual. (For the [[categorical semantics]] of this see at [[dualizing object]] and at _[Wirthm&#252;ller context -- Comparison of push-forwards](Wirthm&#252;ller+context#PushforwardsIntertwinedByDuality)_.)

The first two rows of the intuitionistic/dual-intuitionistic/classical duality generalise to arbitrary [[lattices]], including [[subobject]] lattices in [[coherent category|coherent categories]], and from there to the duality between [[limits]] and [[colimits]] in category theory:

| Limit               |   | Colimit            |
| ------------------- | - | ------------------ |
| [[top]]             |   | [[bottom]]         |
| [[meet]]            |   | [[join]]           |
| [[intersection]]    |   | [[union]]          |
| [[terminal object]] |   | [[initial object]] |
| &#8942;                   |   | &#8942;                  |

So in a way, all [[duality]] in category theory is a generalisation of De Morgan duality.


## The De Morgan laws

The __De Morgan laws__ are the statements, valid in various forms of logic, that De Morgan duality is mediated by [[negation]].  For example, using the second line of the first table, we have
$$ \array {
   \neg(p \wedge q) \equiv \neg{p} \vee \neg{q} ,\\
   \neg(p \vee q) \equiv \neg{p} \wedge \neg{q} .
} $$
Traditionally, the term is reserved for this line.

### In constructive mathematics

In the [[foundations]] of [[constructive mathematics]], __De Morgan\'s Law__ usually means the statement
$$ \neg(p \wedge q) \vdash \neg{p} \vee \neg{q} ,$$
since every other aspect of the first two lines is already constructively valid, the claim that negation mediates the De Morgan self-duality already has a name (the [[double negation]] law, equivalent to the principle of [[excluded middle]]), and no other line involves only operators that appear in intuitionstic [[propositional calculus]].  This de Morgan's law is equivalent to the law of [[weak excluded middle]].

### In homotopy type theory

In the context of [[homotopy type theory]], there are two versions of the constructive De Morgan's law, depending on whether the "or" in the law is interpreted as a [[propositional truncation|propositionally truncated]] [[sum type]] 
$$ \prod_{A,B} \neg(A \wedge B) \to \Vert \neg A + \neg B \Vert $$
or as an untruncated sum type: 
$$ \prod_{A,B} \neg(A \wedge B) \to (\neg A + \neg B). $$

However, [[Martin Escardo]] proved that the truncated and untruncated versions of De Morgan's law are the same: 

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
Truncated De Morgan's law implies [[weak excluded middle|weak]] [[excluded middle]]:
$$ \prod_{A} \neg A + \neg\neg A.$$
=--
Note that truncation or its absence is irrelevant in weak excluded middle, since $\neg A$ and $\neg\neg A$ are mutually exclusive so that $\neg A + \neg\neg A$ is always a proposition.
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $B=\neg A$ in the truncated De Morgan's law, and notice that $\neg(A\wedge \neg A)$ always holds.
=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
Weak excluded middle implies that binary sums of negations have split support:
$$\prod_{A,B} \Vert \neg A + \neg B \Vert \to (\neg A + \neg B). $$
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
By weak excluded middle, either $\neg A$ or $\neg\neg A$.  In the first case, $\neg A + \neg B$ is just true.  In the second case, either $\neg B$ or $\neg\neg B$.  In the first subcase, $\neg A + \neg B$ is again just true.  In the second subcase, we have $\neg\neg A$ and $\neg\neg B$, whence $(\neg A + \neg B) = 0$ and in particular is a proposition.
=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
Truncated De Morgan's law implies untruncated De Morgan's law,
$$ \prod_{A,B} \neg(A \wedge B) \to (\neg A + \neg B) $$
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Combine the two lemmas.

### In the theory of pseudolattice ordered abelian groups

Peter Freyd's definition of a [[pseudolattice ordered abelian group]] in [Freyd 08](#Freyd08) is equational, and so is a [[Lawvere theory]] and could be defined in a category with finite products and a generic object $A$ where every object is equivalent to a finite product of $A$. 

Freyd then showed that the de Morgan laws are satisfied in any [[pseudolattice ordered abelian group]]:

$$-(p \vee q) = (-p) \wedge (-q)$$
$$-(p \wedge q) = (-p) \vee (-q)$$

with the join and meet being the pseudolattice operations and negation being the negation of the abelian group. 

In particular, the de Morgan laws are valid for the [[integers]], the [[rational numbers]], and the [[Dedekind real numbers]], with the join being the maximum function and the meet being the minimum function.
