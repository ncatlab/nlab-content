## Idea

_String phenomenology_ is [[phenomenology]] in [[particle physics]] based on [[model (in particle physics)|models]] that are derived or at least motivated from [[string theory]] (as [[effective QFTs]] from string [[vacua]]).

Broadly speaking, _string phenomenology_ refers to investigations of the connection of [[string theory]] to experimentally observed [[physics]]. More restrictively it refers to constructions of string theory [[vacua]] whose [[effective field theory]] reproduces the [[standard model of particle physics]] and/or the [[standard model of cosmology]].

String theory models natually match the _general_ conceptual structure of the [[standard model of particle physics]] plus [[gravity]] (which is what drives the interest in string theory in the first place): for instance the standard model is a four dimensional [[QFT]] with a [[gauge theory|non-Abelian gauge symmetry]], several [[family of elementary particles|families]] of [[chiral fermions]] and hierarchical [[Yukawa couplings]] -- and the same is true for the generic [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the [[effective QFT]] that describes [[heterotic string theory]] on a 6-dimensional compact space ([CHSW85](#CHSW85)) as well as for [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]] compactified on a [[G2-manifold]] ([AW01](#AW01)).

This structure alone already implies a variety of 3-body decays of the heavier fermions into the lighter ones and the existence of massive [[vector bosons]] coupling to [[charged currents]], which in the observed [[standard model of particle physics]] are the [[W-boson]], etc. (See section III of [AKK12](#AKK12) for an exposition.)

Therefore it is not hard to find string theory compactifications that resemble the observed particle physics in _broad_ strokes. Under some simplifying assumptions many string models have been built that very closely resemble also the fine-structure of the standard model. 

A central technical issue with string [[model (in particle physics)|model building]] is that of the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]] involved: the [[moduli stabilization]]. Historically there had been the hope that the consistency condition of moduli stabilization on string models is so strong that it strongly reduces the number of models that look like the standard model. Arguments that the number is still "not small" even with various extra assumptions lead to the term of a [[landscape of string theory vacua|landscape]] ([[moduli space]]) of string theory models, which remains, however, poorly understood. Arguments for properties of low-energy [[effective QFTs]] that rule out a possibe string-theoretic model have been brought forward for instance in ([Vafa05](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509212)). A review of what is known about the space of possibilities is in ([Taylor11](#Taylor11)).

While all this remains poorly understood, a noteworthy difference of string phenomenology to [[model (in particle physics)|model building]] in bare [[QFT]] is that a) there is a larger framework at all in which to search for models and b) with every model automatically comes a [[UV-completion]], which is the basic motivation for embedding the standard model of particle physics in a broader theory of [[quantum gravity]] in the first place.
