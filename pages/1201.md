In material [[set theory]], the __axiom of foundation__, also called the __axiom of regularity__, states that the membership relation $\in$ on the proper class of all [[pure set]]s is [[well-founded relation|well-founded]].  In structural set theory, accordingly, one uses well-founded relations in building structural models of well-founded pure sets.


# Statement #

Given a proper class $A$ of [[pure set]]s, suppose that $A$ has the property that, given any pure set $x$,
$$ \forall t,\; t \in x \Rightarrow t \in A ,$$
then $x \in A$.  Such an $A$ may be called a _membership-inductive_ class.  Then the __axiom of foundation__ states that the only membership-inductive class of pure sets is the class of all pure sets.  In this form, the axiom of foundation is also called *$\in$-induction*.

Although the statement here refers to proper classes, it can also be formulated as an axiom schema that makes no mention of classes.


# Alternative formulations #

While the statement above follows how the axiom of foundation is generally *used* ---to prove properties of pure sets by [[transfinite induction]]---it is complicated.  Two alternative formulations are given by the following lemmas:

###### Lemma
The axiom of foundation holds if and only if there exists no infinite descending [[sequence]] $\cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
First, suppose the axiom of foundation holds, and suppose there were such a sequence.  Let $A$ be the class of all sets which are not equal to $x_i$ for any $i$.  Then for any $x$, if $x$ were equal to some $x_i$, then some $t\in x$ would also be equal to some $x_j$, namely $x_{i+1}$; hence if all $t\in x$ are in $A$, so is $x$.  Thus, by the axiom of foundation, all sets are in $A$, a contradiction.

Second, suppose there are no such sequences, and let $A$ be as in the statement of foundation.  Suppose that $A$ does not contain all sets.  Then there exists an $x_0\notin A$.  By hypothesis on $A$, there must exist an $x_1\in x_0$ such that $x_1 \notin A$.  And hence an $x_2\in x_1$ such that $x_2 \notin A$, and so on, producing an infinite descending $\in$-sequence in contradiction to our hypothesis; hence $A$ must contain all sets.

This is essentially a transfinite version of Fermat\'s method of [[infinite descent]].

[[Mike Shulman]]: Is it really "transfinite"?  I only see an $\omega$-sequence...

Also, what additional set-theoretic axioms are required for the converse direction of this proof?  It certainly requires excluded middle and infinity, and seems to require at least [[dependent choice]] as well.  Does dependent choice automatically allow choosing a sequence of elements from inhabited classes, rather than inhabited sets?
=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #MembershipMinimal}
###### Lemma
The axiom of foundation holds if and only if every [[inhabited set|inhabited]] pure set $x$ has a member $y \in x$ such that no $t \in x$ satisfies $t \in y$.  (Such a $y$ is called a _membership-minimal_ element of $x$.)

[[Mike Shulman]]: I would like to see a written-out proof of the second lemma.  I can probably produce it myself, but if anyone else has one on their fingertips it would save me some effort.

This version is favoured by [[classical mathematics|classical]] set theorists as a statement of the axiom, since it uses neither higher-order reasoning (as our first definition does) or infinity (as infinite descent does).

However, neither of these is acceptable in [[constructive mathematics]].  This is because both lemmas require the principle of [[excluded middle]] to prove one direction.  Thus the nonexistence of infinite descending sequences is too weak to allow proofs by transfinite induction (except for special forms of $A$), while the requirement that every inhabited pure set have a minimal element is unnecessarily strong and itself implies excluded middle.

+--{: .query}
[[Mike Shulman]]: How is the statement "the relation $\in$ on any [[transitive set]] is a [[well-founded relation]]" related to the axiom of foundation as stated above?

We should probably also mention the version "every pure set appears at some stage in the [[cumulative hierarchy]]".
=--


# Anti-foundation #

Most of set theory works without the axiom of foundation, but not the deep study of well-founded pure sets.  However, one might want to do material set theory without assuming that all sets are well-founded, then one would not assume this axiom.

Alternatively, one can adopt the __axiom of anti-foundation__, which says:

* Given any [[extensional relation|extensional]] binary [[relation]] $\prec$ on any [[set]] $S$, there exists a unique [[transitive set]] $U$ such that $(U,\in)$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $(S,\prec)$.

Just as there are several versions of an [[extensional relation]], there are several versions of this axiom.  Note that the existence part of the statement is a set-formation axiom, while the uniqueness part is a strong version of the [[axiom of extensionality]] (which is equivalent to the usual one for well-founded sets).

If you include the hypothesis that $\prec$ be [[well-founded relation|well-founded]], then the statement is a theorem (Mostowski's collapsing lemma), while the converse is the axiom of foundation.

If you adopt the axiom of anti-foundation (with the strongest notion of extensive relation) instead of foundation, then the universe of [[pure set]]s becomes the [[corecursion|corecursively]] defined ill-founded sets instead of the [[recursion|recursively]] defined well-founded sets.


# Structural meaning #

Since the axiom of foundation is about pure sets, there seems little point to it in a [[structural set theory]].  However, it does have a structural consequence: every set $S$ is the underlying set of elements of a well-founded model for a pure set (in any of the ways described at [[pure set]]).  If one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], however, then this statement follows from the [[well-ordering theorem]], since in that case $S$ is the underlying set of a model for a von Neumann [[ordinal number]].  But the axiom of foundation has no stronger structural consequence, since this statement already suffices to ensure that a model of structural set theory can be reconstructed from the material set theory consisting of its well-founded pure sets.
