In material [[set theory]], the __axiom of foundation__, also called the __axiom of regularity__, states that the membership relation $\in$ on the proper class of all [[pure set]]s is [[well-founded relation|well-founded]].  In structural set theory, accordingly, one uses well-founded relations in building structural models of well-founded pure sets.


# Statement #

Given a proper class $A$ of [[pure set]]s, suppose that $A$ has the property that, given any pure set $x$,
$$ \forall t,\; t \in x \Rightarrow t \in A ,$$
then $x \in A$.  Such an $A$ may be called a _membership-inductive_ class.  Then the __axiom of foundation__ states that the only membership-inductive class of pure sets is the class of all pure sets.  In this form, the axiom of foundation is also called *$\in$-induction*.

Although the statement here refers to proper classes, it can also be formulated as an axiom schema that makes no mention of classes.


# Alternative formulations #

While the statement above follows how the axiom of foundation is generally *used* ---to prove properties of pure sets by [[transfinite induction]]---it is complicated.  Two alternative formulations are given by the following lemmas:

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
The axiom of foundation holds if and only if there exists no infinite descending [[sequence]] $\cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0$.
=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
The axiom of foundation holds if and only if every [[inhabited set|inhabited]] pure set $x$ has a member $y \in x$ such that no $t \in x$ satisfies $t \in y$.  (Such a $y$ is called a _membership-minimal_ element of $x$.)
=--

Lemma (1) is essentially a transfinite version of Fermat\'s method of _infinite descent_.  Lemma (2) is favoured by set theorists as a statement of the axiom, since it uses neither higher-order reasoning (as our first definition does) or infinity (as infinite descent does).

However, neither of these is acceptable in [[constructive mathematics]].  This is because both lemmas require the principle of [[excluded middle]] to prove one direction.  Thus the nonexistence of infinite descending sequences is too weak to allow proofs by transfinite induction (except for special forms of $A$), while the requirement that every inhabited pure set have a minimal element is unnecessarily strong and itself implies excluded middle.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I would like to see written-out proofs of these lemmas.  I can probably produce such proofs myself given enough time, but if anyone else has them on their fingertips it would save me some effort.

Also, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_foundation) suggests that the equivalence between the the statements in two lemmas requires at least [[dependent choice]] (and annoyingly enough, it doesn't mention the $\in$-induction version of foundation at all).  Is that correct?

Thirdly and lastly, how is the statement "the relation $\in$ on any [[transitive set]] is a [[well-founded relation]]" related to the axiom of foundation?
=--


# Anti-foundation #

Most of set theory works without the axiom of foundation, but not the deep study of well-founded pure sets.  However, one might want to do material set theory without assuming that all sets are well-founded, then one would not assume this axiom.

Alternatively, one can adopt the __axiom of anti-foundation__, which says:

* Given any [[extensional relation|extensional]] binary [[relation]] $\prec$ on any [[set]] $S$, there exists a unique [[transitive set]] $U$ such that $(U,\in)$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $(S,\prec)$.

Just as there are several versions of an [[extensional relation]], there are several versions of this axiom.  Note that the existence part of the statement is a set-formation axiom, while the uniqueness part is a strong version of the [[axiom of extensionality]] (which is equivalent to the usual one for well-founded sets).

If you include the hypothesis that $\prec$ be [[well-founded relation|well-founded]], then the statement is a theorem (Mostowski's collapsing lemma), while the converse is the axiom of foundation.

If you adopt the axiom of anti-foundation (with the strongest notion of extensive relation) instead of foundation, then the universe of [[pure set]]s becomes the [[corecursion|corecursively]] defined ill-founded sets instead of the [[recursion|recursively]] defined well-founded sets.


# Structural meaning #

Since the axiom of foundation is about pure sets, there seems little point to it in a [[structural set theory]].  However, it does have a structural consequence: every set $S$ is the underlying set of elements of a well-founded model for a pure set (in any of the ways described at [[pure set]]).  If one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], however, then this statement follows from the [[well-ordering theorem]], since in that case $S$ is the underlying set of a model for a von Neumann [[ordinal number]].  But the axiom of foundation has no stronger structural consequence, since this statement already suffices to ensure that a model of structural set theory can be reconstructed from the material set theory consisting of its well-founded pure sets.
