## Idea

In a [[closed category]] $C$ (for instance a [[closed monoidal category]]) for any two objects $X,Y$ there is an object $hom(X,Y)$ representing the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. This is called the **internal hom**, expressing the idea that this is the perspective on the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ from the inside of $C$.

You can distinguish this from the external [[hom-set]] $Hom(x,y)$; however, every closed category comes equipped with a functor to [[Set]] (although it need not be [[faithful functor|faithful]]) and the external hom is the underlying set of the internal hom.  To be explicit, if $I$ is the [[unit object]] of the closed category $C$, then
$$Hom(I,hom(x,y)) \cong Hom(x,y)$$
by a [[natural isomorphism]].  More generally in a [[closed monoidal category]],
$$Hom(a,hom(b,c)) \cong Hom(a \otimes b,c)$$
naturally.  The rightward map here is often called __[[currying]]__, especially in a [[closed monoidal category]] (and more especially for the $\lambda$-[[lambda-calculus|calculus]]).

Every closed category may be seen as a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over itself.  Accordingly, an internal hom is a special case of a [[hom-object]].

## Examples

### For chain complexes

* [[internal hom of chain complexes]]

### For super vector spaces

The category $SVect$ of [[super vector space]]s has objects $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector space]]s with morphisms being _even_ linear maps between them (linear maps which send even things to even things and odd things to odd things):
$$
 Hom_SVect (V, W) = Even Lin(V,W).
$$
This convention allows one nicely to capture the concepts of superalgebra and so on in succinct categorical terms. But occasionally one does need to refer to the _odd_ linear maps. This is the function of the internal hom:
$$
 hom_SVect (V, W) = Lin(V,W).
$$
Note that $hom_{SVect}$ is indeed a super vector space, with the even elements being those maps which preserve the grading and the odd elements being those which change it. One uses this definition to turn SVect into a [[closed monoidal category]]. 


### For Banach spaces

A similar thing happens in the category $Ban$ of [[Banach spaces]] and [[short linear operators]].  The external hom consists of only the *short* linear maps (those bounded by $1$):
$$ Hom_Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \leq 1 \} .$$
This definition of morphism recovers the most specific notion of [[isomorphism]] of Banach spaces, as well as defining the [[product]] and [[coproduct]] as the [[direct sum]] completed with $p = \infty$ or $p = 1$ respectively.

But the internal hom is the Banach space of *all* bounded linear maps:
$$ hom_Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \lt \infty \} .$$
This is a Banach space and makes $Ban$ into a [[closed category]].
