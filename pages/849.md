## Idea

In a [[closed category]] $C$ (for instance a [[closed monoidal category]]) for any two objects $X,Y$ there is an object $hom(X,Y)$ representing the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. This is called the **internal hom**, expressing the idea that this is the perspective on the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ from the inside of $C$.

You can distinguish this from the external [[hom-set]] $Hom(x,y)$; however, every closed category comes equipped with a functor to [[Set]] (although it need not be [[faithful functor|faithful]]) and the external hom is the underlying set of the internal hom.  To be explicit, if $I$ is the [[unit object]] of the closed category $C$, then
$$Hom(I,hom(x,y)) \cong Hom(x,y)$$
by a [[natural isomorphism]].  More generally in a [[closed monoidal category]],
$$Hom(a,hom(b,c)) \cong Hom(a \otimes b,c)$$
naturally.  The rightward map here is often called __[[currying]]__, especially in a [[closed monoidal category]] (and more especially for the $\lambda$-[[lambda-calculus|calculus]]).

Every closed category may be seen as a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over itself.  Accordingly, an internal hom is a special case of a [[hom-object]].

## Examples
 {#Examples}

### In a sheaf topos or $(\infty,1)$-sheaf $(\infty,1)$-topos
 {#InASheafTopos}


Let $C$ be a [[site]]. Let $\mathbf{H} = Sh(C)$ be the [[sheaf topos]]
over $C$ or in fact the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The sheaf topos $\mathbf{H}$ is a [[cartesian closed category]] / [[cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]]. In fact it is a [[locally cartesian closed category]] / [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]].

=--

Hence the internal hom exist.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X, Y \in \mathbf{H}$ two [[objects]], the internal hom-object

$$
  [X,Y] \in \mathbf{H}
$$

is the [[sheaf]]/[[(∞,1)-sheaf]] given by the assignsment

$$
  [X,Y] : U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,,
$$

for all objects $U \in C$ which on the right we regard under the [[Yoneda embedding]]/[[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma|∞-Yoneda embedding]] $U \in C \stackrel{Yoneda}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}$.

Here

* $U \times X \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[cartesian product]] if $U$ with $X$

* $\mathbf{H}(-,-)$ is the [[hom set]]-[[functor]] / [[derived hom-space|hom space]]-[[(∞,1)-functor]] of $\mathbf{H}$.

###### Remark

In the ([[homotopy type theory|homotopy]]-)[[type theory]] [[syntax]] of the [[internal language]] of $\mathbf{H}$ the internal hom $[X, Y] \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[categorical semantics]] of the [[function type]]

$$
  \vdash (X \to Y) : Type
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop #CompositionOfInternalFunctionsInSheafTopos}
###### Proposition

For $X, Y, Z \in \mathbf{H}$ three [[objects]] of $\mathbf{H}$, the canonical [[composition]] [[morphism]]

$$
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [X, Y] \times [Y, Z] \to [X, Z]
$$

is given by the morphism of [[presheaves]]/[[(∞,1)-presheaves]] whose component over $U \in C$ is the morphism of [[sets]]/[[∞-groupoids]]

$$
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \times
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Z)
$$

which sends a pair $(f : U \times X \to Y, g : U \times Y \to Z)$ to the composite

$$
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)(f,g)
  = 
  U \times X 
  \stackrel{(\Delta_U, id_X)}{\to}
  U \times U \times X
  \stackrel{(id_U, f)}{\to}
  U \times Y 
  \stackrel{g}{\to}
  Z
  \,,
$$

where $\Delta_U : U \to U \times U$ is the [[diagonal]] morphism on $U$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Intuitively this says that the composite of a $U$-parameterized family of maps $\{f(u) :  X \to Y| u \in U\}$ with a $U$-parameterized family of maps ${g(u) : Y \to Z| u \in U}$ is the $U$-family given by the parameter-wise composite $\{g(u)\circ f(u) | u \in U\}$.

###### Example

The internal [[automorphism group]]/[[automorphism ∞-group]] of an [[object]] $X \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[subobject]]

$$
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) \hookrightarrow [X,X]
$$

of the internal hom which is maximal subject to the property that the composition of prop. \ref{CompositionOfInternalFunctionsInSheafTopos} becomes invertible.

The ([[homotopy type theory|homotopy]]-)[[type theory]] [[syntax]] for this is given by the [[type]] of [[equivalences in homotopy type theory]]

$$
  \vdash (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X) : Type

### For smooth spaces and smooth $\infty$-groupoids

Consider the [[site]] $C = $ [[SmthMfd]] of [[smooth manifolds]] (and the [[open cover]] [[coverage]]) or equivalently over the [[dense subsite]] [[CartSp]] of [[Cartesian spaces]] and [[smooth functions]] between these.


The [[sheaf topos]]/[[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H} = Sh(C)$ is that of [[smooth spaces]]/[[smooth ∞-groupoids]]. So the discussion of internal homs here is a special case of the above discussion _[In a sheaf topos](#InASheafTopos)_.


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $X , Y \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ two [[smooth manifolds]], the [[internal hom]] $[X,Y] \in \mathbf{H}$ is the [[mapping space]] between them regarded as a [[diffeological space]].

See at _[[manifold structure of mapping spaces]]_ for when this internal hom is [[representable functor|representable]] again by a [[smooth manifold]].

=--


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $X \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ the internal automorphism group, example \ref{InternalAutomorphismGroup}, of $X$ is the [[diffeomorphism group]] of $X$, regarded as a [[diffeological space|diffeological]] group

$$
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) = \mathbf{Diff}(X)
  \,.
$$

### For chain complexes

* [[internal hom of chain complexes]]

### For super vector spaces

The category $SVect$ of [[super vector space]]s has objects $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector space]]s with morphisms being _even_ linear maps between them (linear maps which send even things to even things and odd things to odd things):
$$
 Hom_SVect (V, W) = Even Lin(V,W).
$$
This convention allows one nicely to capture the concepts of superalgebra and so on in succinct categorical terms. But occasionally one does need to refer to the _odd_ linear maps. This is the function of the internal hom:
$$
 hom_SVect (V, W) = Lin(V,W).
$$
Note that $hom_{SVect}$ is indeed a super vector space, with the even elements being those maps which preserve the grading and the odd elements being those which change it. One uses this definition to turn SVect into a [[closed monoidal category]]. 


### For Banach spaces

A similar thing happens in the category $Ban$ of [[Banach spaces]] and [[short linear operators]].  The external hom consists of only the *short* linear maps (those bounded by $1$):
$$ Hom_Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \leq 1 \} .$$
This definition of morphism recovers the most specific notion of [[isomorphism]] of Banach spaces, as well as defining the [[product]] and [[coproduct]] as the [[direct sum]] completed with $p = \infty$ or $p = 1$ respectively.

But the internal hom is the Banach space of *all* bounded linear maps:
$$ hom_Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \lt \infty \} .$$
This is a Banach space and makes $Ban$ into a [[closed category]].
