In a [[closed category]] $C$ (for instance a [[closed monoidal category]]) for any two objects $X,Y$ there is an object $hom(X,Y)$ representing the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. This is called the **internal hom**, expressing the idea that this the perspective on the collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ from the inside of $C$.
