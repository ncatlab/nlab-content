## Statements

In its usual form, the _Eckmann--Hilton argument_ shows that a [[monoid object|monoid]] or [[group object]] [[internalization|in]] the category of [[monoids]] or [[Grp|groups]] is [[abelian group|commutative]]. In other terms, if a [[set]] is equipped with two monoid structures, such that one is a homomorphism for the other, then the two structures coincide and the resulting monoid is commutative.

From the [[nPOV]], we may want to think of the statement in this way:

+-- {: .num_prop #2cat}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[2-category]] and $x \in C$ an [[object]]. Write $Id_x$ for the [[identity]] [[morphism]] of $X$ and $End(Id_x)$ for the set of [[endomorphism|endo]]-[[2-morphism]]s on $X$. Then:

* [[horizontal composition]] and [[vertical composition]] define the same [[monoid object]] structure on $End(Id_x)$;

* this is an [[abelian monoid]].
=--

On the face of it, this is a special case of the general situation, although in fact every case is an example for appropriate $C$.

A more general version is this:  If a set is equipped with two binary operations with [[identity elements]], as long as they commute with each other in the sense that one is (with respect to the other) a homomorphism of sets with binary operations, then everything else follows:

1.  the other is also a homomorphism with respect to the first;
2.  each also preserves the other\'s identity;
3.  the identities are the same;
4.  the operations are the same;
5.  the operation is commutative;
6.  the operation is associative.

This can also be [[internalisation|internalised]] in any [[monoidal category]].


## Proofs

A [[pasting diagram]]-proof of \ref{2cat} is depicted in [Cheng](#Cheng) below.  Here we prove the $6$-element general form in $Set$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
The basic equation that we have (that one operation $*$ is a homomorphism with respect to another operation $\circ$) is
$$ (a \circ b) * (c \circ d) = (a * c) \circ (b * d) .$$ 
In $End(Id_x)$, this is the [[exchange law]].

We prove the list of results from above in order:

1.  Simply read the basic equation backwards to see that $\circ$ is a homomorphism with respect to $*$.

2.  Now if $1_*$ is the identity of $*$ and $1_\circ$ is the identity of $\circ$, we have
$$ 1_\star \circ 1_\star = (1_\star \circ 1_\star) * 1_\star = (1_\star \circ 1_\star) * (1_\star \circ 1_\circ) = (1_\star * 1_\star) \circ (1_\star * 1_\circ) = 1_\star \circ 1_\circ = 1_\star .$$
A similar argument proves the other half.

3.  Then
$$ 1_\star = 1_\star * 1_\star = (1_\star \circ 1_\circ) * (1_\circ \circ 1_\star) = (1_\star * 1_\circ) \circ (1_\circ * 1_\star) = 1_\circ \circ 1_\circ = 1_\circ ,$$
so the identities are the same; we will now write this identity simply as $1$.

4.  Now
$$ a * b = (a \circ 1) * (1 \circ b) = (a * 1) \circ (1 * b) = a \circ b ,$$
so the operations are the same; we will write them both with concatenation.

5.  Then
$$ a b = (1 a) (b 1) = (1 b) (a 1) = b a ,$$
so this operation is commutative.

6.  Finally,
$$ (a b) c = (a b) (1 c) = (a 1) (b c) = a (b c) ,$$
so the operation is associative.
=--

If you start with a monoid object in $Mon$, then only (4&5) need to be shown; the others are part of the hypothesis.  This classic form of the Eckmann--Hilton argument may be combined into a single calculation:
$$ a * b = (a \circ 1) * (1 \circ b) = (a * 1) \circ (1 * b) = a \circ b = (1 * a) \circ (b * 1) = (1 * b) \circ (a * 1) = b * a ,$$
where the desired results involve the first, middle, and last expressions.


## Corollaries

A $2$-[[k-tuply monoidal n-category|tuply monoidal]] $0$-[[0-category|category]], if defined as a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[k-tuply connected n-category|simply connected]] [[bicategory]], is also the same as an abelian monoid.

A $2$-tuply monoidal $1$-[[1-category|category]], if defined as a pointed simply connected [[tricategory]], is the same as a [[braided monoidal category]].

Every [[homotopy group]] $\pi_n$ for $n \geq 2$ is [[abelian group|abelian]].

##History

The beautiful and powerful Eckmann-Hilton argument is due to [[Beno Eckmann]] and [[Peter Hilton]].
