## Idea

In foundations without the [[axiom of choice]], it is not true that every [[equivalence of categories]] is a [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[essentially surjective functor]], since the mere property of being isomorphic is not enough to get a specific isomorphism between two objects without the axiom of choice. Instead one has to use split essentially surjective functors, where the isomorphisms are structure rather than mere property. 

## Definition

\begin{definition}
A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **split essentially surjective** if the functor come with the structure of a [[family]] of [[isomorphisms]]  
$$p_y \in \biguplus_{x \in C} (F(x) \cong y)$$
indexed by objects $y \in D$. 
\end{definition}

## Examples

* Every [[equivalence of categories]] is fully faithful and split essentially surjective. 

* Every essentially surjective functor between [[gaunt categories]] is split essentially surjective. 

## Properties

* Every split essentially surjective functor is [[essentially surjective]]. 

* That every essentially surjective functor is split essentially surjective is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]]

## In homotopy type theory

In [[homotopy type theory]], the definition above still holds for general [[precategories]], when translated into type theoretic language: 

\begin{definition}
A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **split essentially surjective** if the functor comes with the structure of an dependent [[isomorphism]]  
$$p(y):\sum_{x:C} (F(x) \cong y)$$
for all objects $y:D$. 
\end{definition}

This differs from the definition of an [[essentially surjective functor]] by the lack of [[propositional truncations]] in the definition: 

\begin{definition}
A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **essentially surjective** if the there is a dependent term  
$$p(y):\left[\sum_{x:C} (F(x) \cong y)\right]$$
for all objects $y:D$. 
\end{definition}

However, in the case for precategories, that every essentially surjective functor is split essentially surjective is false for precategories. The categories for which essentially surjective functors are split essentially surjective are the broader class of [[univalent categories]], rather than the [[gaunt categories]].
