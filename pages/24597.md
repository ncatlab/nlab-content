## Idea

In foundations without the [[axiom of choice]], it is not true that every [[equivalence of categories]] is a [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[essentially surjective functor]], since the [[mere property]] of there being an object $x$ such that $F(x) \cong y$ is not enough to get a specific object $x$ and a specific isomorphism $i:F(x) \cong y$. 

However, one could instead simply require the [[structure]] of a chosen object and isomorphism in the definition, which leads to the definition of a split essentially surjective functor. (compare a [[vector space]] which merely has a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] with a vector space with the structre of a specific basis). 

## Definition

In [[homotopy type theory]], a [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **split essentially surjective** if all objects $y \in D$ come with the structure of an element of the indexed [[disjoint union]]  
$$p(y) \in \biguplus_{x \in C} F(x) \cong y$$

### In homotopy type theory

In [[homotopy type theory]], a [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **split essentially surjective** if all objects $y:D$ come with an element 
$$p(y):\sum_{x:C} F(x) \cong y$$

## Properties

* Every [[equivalence of categories]] is fully faithful and split essentially surjective. 

* Every essentially surjective functor between [[gaunt categories]] is split essentially surjective.
