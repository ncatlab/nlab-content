## Definition

For $C$ a [[small category]], its **category of presheaves** is the [[functor category]] 

$$
  PSh(C) := [C^{op}, Set]
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of $C$ to [[Set]]. 

An object in this category is a [[presheaf]]. See there for more details.

## Properties

* The category of presheaves $PSh(C)$ is the [[free cocompletion]] of $C$.

* the [[Yoneda lemma]] says that the [[Yoneda embedding]] $j : C \to PSh(C)$ is -- in particular -- a [[full and faithful functor]].

* A category of presheaves is a [[topos]].

* A [[reflective subcategory]] of a category of presheaves is a [[locally presentable category]].

* A [[geometric embedding|sub-topos]] of a category of presheaves is a [[Grothendieck topos]]: a [[category of sheaves]].

+--{: .query}
[[David Roberts]]: so the only sub-topoi of $PSh(C)$ are categories of sheaves? Do these need to be sheaves on $C$ with some Grothendieck topology, or can they be sheaves on other sites? Isn't there some way of cooking up a sub-topos using a subcategory of $C$?

[[Harry Gindi]]: Grothendieck topologies are in canonical bijection with full reflective subcategories of the presheaf category, if I remember correctly.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Grothendieck topologies on $C$ are in canonical
bijection with left-exact-reflective subcategories of a presheaf
category, i.e. geometric subtoposes.  You can define a subtopos in
other ways, but it will always end up being *equivalent* to one
determined by a Grothendieck topology on $C$.
