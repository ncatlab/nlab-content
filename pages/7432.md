## Idea

An atom in a [[poset]] is a [[minimal element]] among those which are not actually the [[bottom element|minimum]].  Thus an atom is as small as possible without being nothing.  In an atomic poset, every element may be broken down (typically not uniquely) into atoms.


## Definitions

Let $S$ be a [[poset]] (or [[proset]]) with a [[bottom element]] $\bot$.  Recall that an element of $S$ is __[[positive element|positive]]__ if it is not a bottom element.  An element $a$ of $S$ is __atomic__ if, given any element $p \leq a$, $p$ is positive iff $a \leq p$.  An __atom__ of $S$ is simply an atomic element of $S$.  Note that every atom must be positive (since $a \leq a$).

The atoms are precisely the [[minimal elements]] of the set of positive elements.  For a poset, $a$ is atomic iff every $p \leq a$ is positive iff $p = a$.  Using [[classical logic]] too, $a$ is atomic iff every $p \leq a$ satisfies $p = \bot$ [[xor]] $p = a$.

The p(r)oset $S$ is __atomic__ if every element is a [[supremum]] of atoms.  In this case, every element $x$ is a supremum of those atoms $a \leq x$.  Note that $\bot$ is a supremum of no atoms, and every atom is a supremum of itself, so the condition is really about the nontrivial nonatomic elements.

In [[constructive mathematics]], we require a more complicated definition of a [[positive element]], but the other definitions above remain correct (under the stated conditions), once we have that.  In [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] constructive mathematics, positivity cannot be defined at all, and $S$ must come equipped with a [[positivity predicate]] before we may consider its atoms.

### Remarks on terminology 

There is some terminological variance in the literature to the notion of atomic poset as defined here. In particular, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28order_theory%29) defines an _atomic poset_ to be a poset in which every element has an atom below it, and refers to our notion of atomic poset by the term "atomistic poset". The Wikipedia conventions are observed in (many? most?) lattice-theoretic texts such as the book by Gr&auml;tzer (citation needed). 

The two notions coincide in the case of complete Boolean algebras. 

Our _pro tem_ decision to define the word "atomic" in the manner above is consistent with its use elsewhere in category theory; see the sections below on atomic objects and on categorification. 

## Examples

The [[singleton subsets]] are the atoms in a [[power set]].  Every power set is atomic, and in fact every atomic [[complete boolean algebra]] is (up to [[isomorphism]]) a power set.

## Properties

If $a$ is an atom [[lattice]] or more generally a [[meet]] [[semilattice]] and $b$ any other element then

$$a \wedge b \in \{a, \bot\}$$

## Atoms and atomic objects 

Recall that if $E$ is a locally small category, an [[tiny object|atomic object]] (also called a "tiny object") is an object $e$ such that $E(e, -)\colon E \to Set$ preserves all [[colimits]] that exist in $E$.

As partial justification for this terminology, we have the following elementary result. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition 
An atomic object in a Boolean algebra is precisely an atom. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
Let $\mathbf{2}$ denote the object of truth values $\{0, 1\}$. If $a$ is an atom, then $B(a, -) \colon B \to \mathbf{2}$ preserves the [[initial object]] (since it is itself not initial), and if $\{x_i\}$ is a nonempty collection of elements that admits a supremum such that $a \leq \bigvee_i x_i$, then 

$$a = a \wedge \bigvee_i x_i = \bigvee_i a \wedge x_i$$ 

(where the second equation holds since $a \wedge -$ is a left adjoint, because $B$ is a Heyting algebra), and so we cannot have $a \wedge x_i = 0$ for all $i$. Thus $0 \lt a \wedge x_i \leq a$ for some $i$, where the second inequality is an equality since $a$ is an atom. Thus $a \leq x_i$ for some $i$, which is what we want. 

If $a$ is not an atom, i.e., if $0 \lt b \lt a$ for some $b$, then 

$$a = b \vee (a \wedge \neg b)$$ 

If $B(a, -)$ preserved the join on the right, then either $a \leq b$ which is evidently false, or $a \leq a \wedge \neg b$, i.e., $a \leq \neg b$, i.e., $b = a \wedge b \leq 0$, also evidently false. Thus $B(a, -)$ does not preserve suprema. 
=-- 

Only one half of this proposition holds (an atom is an atomic object) if we replace the Boolean algebra $B$ by a general [[frame]]. On the other hand, atomic objects need not be atoms (an easy example is the frame of down-sets of a [[poset]], where principal down-sets are atomic objects, but generally not atoms in the underlying poset of the frame). 

Be this as it may, [Lawvere](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/ToposMotion.pdf#page=6) has written, "In order to settle once and for all the various terminological differences, perhaps we can use a.t.o.m. as an abbreviation for 'amazing tiny object model'." This is Lawvere's 'objective' way of abbreviating "atomic object"; the word 'amazing' here is presumably chosen to evoke what Lawvere has called the "amazing right adjoint" to an exponential functor $(-)^D$, particularly in the case of [[synthetic differential geometry]] where such adjoints exist for [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal objects]] $D$. 


## Categorification 

The result that an atomic complete Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a power set -- hence to a [[presheaf]] with values in the [[0-category]] $\mathbf{2} = (-1)Grpd$ of [[(-1)-groupoid|(-1)-groupoids]] -- has a categorified analogue as follows.  Define a category $E$ to be **[[atomic category|atomic]]** if it has a small [[generating set]] of atomic objects. 


+-- {: .num_thm}
###### Theorem (Bunge)
A category $E$ is equivalent to a [[presheaf topos]] (functors with values in the 1-category [[Set]] of [[0-groupoids]]) if and only if it is cocomplete, atomic, and [[regular category|regular]]. Representables $C(-, c)$ are (among the) atomic objects of $Set^{C^{op}}$, and form a generating set.
