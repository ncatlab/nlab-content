## Idea

An [[lattice]] is _complemented_ if every element has a [[complement]]. It is _orthocomplemented_ if it is equipped with an [[involution]] that sends each element to a complement.


## Examples

These are both orthocomplemented:

* any [[Boolean algebra]], as in [[classical logic]]

* the [[subspaces]] of a [[Hilbert space]], as in Birkhoff--von Neumann [[quantum logic]]
