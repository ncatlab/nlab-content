__Gian-Carlo Rota__ was a great [[combinatorialist]]; in addition to numerous concrete results he deserves much credit on systematizing many methods.

A nice reading about appreciation of systematic/foundational work in mathematics is his preface ([pdf](http://bergeron.math.uqam.ca/Species/foreword.pdf), [ps.gz](http://bergeron.math.uqam.ca/Species/foreword.ps.gz), [bookpage](http://bergeron.math.uqam.ca/Species/especes.html)) to [[Combinatorial species and tree-like structures]] (Enc. Math. Appl., Camb. Univ. Press 1997) by F. Bergeron, G. Labelle and P. Leroux.
