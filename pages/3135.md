## Definition


For a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **unitary group** $U(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$.   This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ [[unitary matrices]].


More generally, for a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the group of [[unitary operator]]s on that Hilbert space. For the purposes of studying unitary representations of Lie groups, the topology is chosen to be the [[operator topology|strong operator topology]], although other topologies on $U(\mathcal{H})$ are frequently considered for other purposes. 

## Properties

The unitary groups are naturally [[topological group]]s and [[Lie group]]s (infinite dimensional if $\mathcal{H}$ is infinite dimensional).

###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{H}$ a Hilbert space, which can be either finite or infinite dimensional, the unitary group $U(\mathcal{H})$ and the [[general linear group]] $GL(\mathcal{H})$, regarded as [[topological group]]s, have the same [[homotopy type]]. 

More specifically, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is a [[maximal compact subgroup]] of $GL(\mathcal{H})$.

###### Theorem
**(Kuiper's theorem)**

For a separable infinite-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$, the unitary group $U(\mathcal{H})$ is [[contractible]].

###### Remark

This in contrast to the finite dimensional situation. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ($n \ge 1$), $U(n)$ is not contractible.

Write $B U(n)$ for the [[classifying space]] of the [[topological group]] $U(n)$. Inclusion of matrices into larger matrices gives a canonical sequence of inclusions

$$
  \cdots \to B U(n) \hookrightarrow B U(n+1) \hookrightarrow B U(n+2) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[homotopy limit|homotopy]] [[direct limit]] over this is written

$$
  B U := {\lim_\to}_n B U(n)
$$

or sometimes $B U(\infty)$. Notice that this is very different from $B U(\mathcal{H})$ for $\mathcal{H}$ an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. See [[topological K-theory]] for more on this.

###### Proposition

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ is a split [[group extension]] of the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ by the [[special unitary group]] $SU(n)$

$$
  SU(n) \to U(n) \to U(1)
  \,.
$$

Hence it is a [[semidirect product group]]

$$
  U(n) \simeq SU(n) \rtimes U(1)
  \,.
$$
