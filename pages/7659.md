## Definition

In the context of [[generalized complex geometry]] one says for $X$ a [[manifold]], $T X$ its [[tangent bundle]] and $T^* X$ the [[cotangent bundle]] that the fiberwise [[direct sum]]-bundle $T X \oplus T^* X$ is the _generalized tangent bundle_.

## Properties

### As an associated bundle

The ordinary [[tangent bundle]] is the canonical [[associated bundle]] to the [[general linear group]]-[[principal bundle]] classified by the morphism

$$
  g_{T X} : X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)
$$

to the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stack]] of $GL(n)$.

Similarly there is a canonical morphism

$$
  (g_{T X}, g^*_{T X}) X \to \mathbf{B} O(n,n)
$$

to the [[moduli stack]] which is the [[delooping]] of the [[Narain group]] $O(n,n)$.

### Reduction of structure group

Where a [[reduction of structure groups|reduction of the structure group]] of the tangent bundle along $\mathbf{B} O(n) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ is equivalently a [[vielbein]]/[[orthogonal structure]]/[[Riemannian metric]] on $X$, so a reduction of the structure group of the generalized tangent bundle along $\mathbf{B} O(n) \times O(n) \to \mathbf{B}O(n,n)$ is a [[generalized vielbein]], [[type II geometry]].
