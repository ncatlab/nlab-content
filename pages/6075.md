
The term __'noncommutative [[sheaf]]'__ is an informal term which for some people denotes either

* a sheaf of [[noncommutative algebras]] on a space or on a site, or

* a sheaf (of anything, say, of sets or abelian groups) on a [[noncommutative space]]. 

The latter concept of a sheaf is in a more general sense than sheaf on a [[site]]; see

* [[sheaf on a noncommutative space]].
