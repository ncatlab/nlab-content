__Noncommutative sheaf__ is an informal term which for some people denotes either

* a sheaf of noncommutative algebras on a space or on a site, or

* a sheaf (of anything, say sets) on a noncommutative space. 

The latter concept of a sheaf is in a more general sense than sheaf on
a site. For the latter see

* [[sheaf on a noncommutative space]]
