Hi, I co-author the mathematical blog [Topological Musings](http://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com) with [Todd Trimble](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Todd+Trimble).

I hope to fill up more of this page as time progresses. 

**Books**

There are at least three books that I would highly recommend to an undergraduate student who may have the requisite "mathematical maturity" but perhaps has not tasted the elixir of [Category Theory](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory) yet.

* [Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories](http://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255426142&sr=8-1) (Paperback) - F. William Lawvere and Stephen H. Schanuel.

* [Sets for Mathematics](http://www.amazon.com/Sets-Mathematics-F-William-Lawvere/dp/0521804442/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255426295&sr=1-3) - F. William Lawvere and Robert Rosebrugh

* [Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Topoi-Categorial-Analysis-Logic-Mathematics/dp/0486450260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255426408&sr=1-1) - Robert Goldblatt.

I intend to write reviews (containing details on each chapter, hopefully) for all the aforementioned books some time in the future. It will be a work in progress.
