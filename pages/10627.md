In the context of [[superalgebra]], the [[quotient]] of a superalgebra by the ideal generated by its odd part (its "[[soul]]") is called its _body_.

See at _[superalgebra -- Adjoints to inclusion of plain algebras](super+algebra#AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra)_.

This terminology is (for the special case of [[Grassmann algebras]] at least) due to [DeWitt 92, p. 1](#DeWitt92)
