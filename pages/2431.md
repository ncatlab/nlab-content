## Idea

The classical _Brown representability theorem_ ([Brown 62](#Brown62), [Adams 71](#Adams71)) says that certain contravariant [[functors]] on the [[homotopy category]] are [[representable functor|representable]].  This is used, for instance, to show that every [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is representable by a [[spectrum]]. (But beware that the cohomology theory in general contains less information than the spectrum, due to [[phantom maps]]. (see also [MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/q/117684/381)))

There are various generalizations, such as to [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]] ([Neeman 96](#Neeman96)), to various [[model categories]] ([Jardine 09](#Jardine09)) and notably to suitable [[(∞,1)-categories]] ([Lurie, theorem 1.4.1.2](#LurieHigherAlgebra)).  But in any case there are some crucial conditions for the theorem to apply,such as

* [[group]] structure on the values of the functor, as is the case for an (abelian) cohomology theory, and as would be the case for a represented functor in any [[additive category]], 

OR

* the existence of a [[strong generator]] in the homotopy category in question.

In particular, there is no Brown representability theorem for functors from the homotopy category of pointed not-necessarily-connected spaces to pointed sets, or for functors from the homotopy category of unpointed spaces to sets.  In fact, there are counterexamples in these two cases ([Freyd-Heller 93](#FreydHeller93), see remark \ref{Counterexamples}.


## Classical formulation for homotopy functors on topological spaces
 {#ClassicalFormulation}


Let $Ho(Top_*^c)$ denote the [[homotopy category]] of connected [[pointed topological spaces]] under [[weak homotopy equivalence]] --- or equivalently the homotopy category of pointed connected [[CW complexes]] under [[homotopy equivalence]].  Then $Ho(Top_*^c)$ has [[coproducts]] (given by [[wedge sums]]) and also [[weak limit|weak pushouts]] (namely, [[homotopy pushouts]]).

+-- {: .num_theorem #ClassicalBrownRepresentabilityTheorem}
###### Theorem
**(Brown-Adams)**

A [[functor]] $F:Ho(Top_*^c)^{op} \to Set_*$ is [[representable functor|representable]] precisely if

1. it [[preserved limit|takes]] [[coproducts]] to [[products]], 

1. it takes  [[weak pushouts]] to  [[weak pullbacks]].  

=--

(e.g. [Aguilar-Gitler-Prito 02, theorem 12.2.18](#AguilarGitlerPrito02))

Note that it is immediate that every representable functor has the given properties; the nontrivial statement is that these properties already characterize representable functors.

When the theorem is stated in terms of CW complexes, the second property (taking [[weak pushouts]] to [[weak pullbacks]]) is often phrased equivalently as:

* The **Mayer-Vietoris axiom**: For every [[CW-pair|CW-triple]] $(X; A_1, A_2)$ (with $A_1\cup A_2 = X$) and any elements $x_1\in F(A_1)$, $x_2\in F(A_2)$ such that $x_1|A_1\cap A_2 = x_2|A_1\cap A_2$, there exists $y\in F(X)$ such that $y|A_1 = x_1$ and $y|A_2 = x_2$.

+-- {: .num_remark #Counterexamples}
###### Remark
**(counterexamples)**
 
The statement of theorem \ref{ClassicalBrownRepresentabilityTheorem} without the restriction to *connected* pointed spaces is false, as is the analogous statement for unpointed spaces.

In ([Freyd-Heller 93](#FreydHeller93)), it is show that if $G$ is [[Thompson's group F]], with $g:G\to G$ its canonical endomorphism, then $g$ does not [[split idempotent|split]] in the quotient of [[Grp]] by conjugacy.  Since the quotient of [[Grp]] by conjugacy embeds as the full subcategory of the unpointed homotopy category $Ho(Top)$ on connected [[homotopy 1-types]], we have an endomorphism $B g:B G \to B G$ of the [[classifying space]] of $G$ which does not split in $Ho(Top)$.

Thus, if $F:Ho(Top)^{op} \to Set$ splits the idempotent $[-,B g]$ of $[-,B G]$, then $F$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Brown representability theorem (being a [[retract]] of a representable functor), but is not representable.  A similar argument using $B G_+$ applies to $Ho(Top_*)$.

There is also another example due to Heller, which fais to be representable for cardinality reasons.

## For homotopy functors on presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories
 {#InInfinity1Categories}

The [classical formulation](#ClassicalFormulation) of Brown representability is only superficially concerned with [[topological spaces]]. Instead, via the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], one finds that the statement only concerns the [[simplicial localization]] of [[Top]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]], hence the [[(∞,1)-category]] $L_{whe} Top\simeq $ [[∞Grpd]].

We discuss now the natural formulation of the Brown representability theorem for functors out of [[homotopy categories of (∞,1)-categories]] following ([Lurie, section 1.4.1](#LurieHigherAlgebra)). See also the exposition in ([Mathew 11](#Mathew11)).

+-- {: .num_defn #BrownFunctorOnInfinityCategory}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]]. A [[functor]]

$$
  F \;\colon\; Ho(\mathcal{C})^{op} \longrightarrow Set
$$

(from the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of $\mathcal{C}$ to [[Set]])

is called a **[[Brown functor]]** if 

1. it sends small [[coproducts]] to [[products]];

1. it sends [[(∞,1)-pushouts]] in $\mathcal{C}\to Ho(\mathcal{C})$ to [[weak pullbacks]] in [[Set]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A _[[weak pullback]]_ is a diagram that satisfies the existence clause of a [[pullback]], but not necessarily the uniqueness condition. Hence the second clause in def. \ref{BrownFunctorOnInfinityCategory} says that for a [[(∞,1)-pushout]] square 

$$
  \array{
    Z &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& X \underset{Z}{\sqcup}Y 
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$, then the induced universal morphism


$$
  F\left(X \underset{Z}{\sqcup}Y\right)
  \stackrel{epi}{\longrightarrow}
  F(X) \underset{F(Z)}{\times} F(Y)
$$

into the actual [[pullback]] is an [[epimorphism]].

###### Theorem
**(Brown representability)**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]]. 

If 

1. $\mathcal{C}$ is [[compactly generated (∞,1)-category|generated]] by a set

   $$
    \{S_i \in \mathcal{C}\}_{i \in I}
   $$

   of [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact objects]] (i.e. every object of $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[(∞,1)-colimit]] of the objects $S_i$.)

1. each $S_i$ admits the structure of a [[cogroup]] object in the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(\mathcal{C})$, 

then a [[functor]]

$$
  F \;\colon\; Ho(\mathcal{C})^{op} \longrightarrow Set
$$

(from the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] of $\mathcal{C}$ to [[Set]])
is [[representable functor|representable]] precisely if it is a [[Brown functor]], def. \ref{BrownFunctorOnInfinityCategory}.

###### Example
**([[suspensions are H-cogroup objects]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[finite (∞,1)-colimits]] and with a [[zero object]]. Write $\Sigma \colon X \mapsto 0 \underset{X}{\coprod} 0$ for the [[reduced suspension]] functor.

Then the [[fold map]]

$$
  \Sigma X \coprod \Sigma X
    \simeq
  0 \underset{X}{\sqcup} 0 \underset{X}{\sqcup} 0
    \longrightarrow
  0 \underset{X}{\sqcup} X \underset{X}{\sqcup} 0
  \simeq
  0 \underset{X}{\sqcup} 0
  \simeq
  \Sigma X
$$

exhibits [[cogroup]] structure on the image of $\Sigma X$ in the [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy category]].

This is equivalently the [[group]]-structure of the first ([[fundamental group|fundamental]]) [[homotopy group]] of the values of [[representable functor|functor co-represented]] by $\Sigma X$:

$$
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma X, -)
   \;\colon\;
  Y 
   \mapsto
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma X, Y)
   \simeq
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(X, \Omega Y)
   \simeq
  \pi_1 Ho(\mathcal{C})(X, Y)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

In bare [[pointed homotopy types]] $\mathcal{C} = $[[∞Grpd]]${}^{\ast/}$, the ([[homotopy types]] of) [[n-spheres]] $S^n$ are [[cogroup]] objects for $n \geq 1$, but not for $n = 0$, by example \ref{SuspensionsAreHCogroupObjects}. These are certainly [[compact object in an (∞,1)-category|compact objects]]. 

While $\{S^n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ generates all of $\infty Grpd^{\ast/}$, this does does not satisfy the clauses of theorem \ref{BrownRepresentabilityOnPresentableInfinityCategories} due to the failure of $S^0$ to have [[cogroup]] structure.

Removing that generator, the $(\infty,1)$-category generated by $\{S^n\}_{{n \in \mathbb{N}} \atop {n \geq 1}}$ is $\infty Grpd^{\ast/}_{\geq 1}$, that of _connected_ pointed homotopy types. This is how the connectedness condition arises.

A **reduced [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory** on $\mathcal{C}$ is

1. a [[natural isomorphisms]] ("[[suspension isomorphisms]]") of degree +1

   $$

###### Definition

Given a generalized cohomology theory $(H^\bullet,\delta)$ on some $\mathcal{C}$ as in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}, and given a [[homotopy cofiber sequence]] in $\mathcal{C}$

$$
  X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} Z

By the defining exactness of $H^\bullet$, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}, and the way this appears in def. \ref{ConnectinHomomorphismForCohomologyTheoryOnInfinityCategory}, using that $\delta$ is by definition an isomorphism.

Given a generalized cohomology functor $H^\bullet \colon Ho(\mathcal{C})^{op}\to Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}$, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}, its underlying [[Set]]-valued functors $H^n \colon Ho(\mathcal{C})^{op}\to Ab\to Set$ are [[Brown functors]], def. \ref{BrownFunctorOnInfinityCategory}.

###### Proof

The first condition on a [[Brown functor]] holds by definition of $H^\bullet$. For the second condition, given a homotopy pushout square


$$
  \array{
    X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{} && \downarrow
    \\
    X_2 &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$, consider the induced morphism of the [[long exact sequences]] given by prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfACohomologyTheoryOnAnInfinityCategory}

$$
  \array{
    H^\bullet(coker(f_2))
      &\longrightarrow&
    H^\bullet(Y_2)

Here the outer vertical morphisms are [[isomorphisms]], as shown, due to the [[pasting law]] (see also at _[fiberwise recognition of stable homotopy pushouts](homotopy+pullback#FiberwiseRecognitionInStableCase)_). 
This means that the [[four lemma]] applies to this diagram. Inspection shows that this implies the claim.

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

Let $\mathcal{C}$be an [[(∞,1)-category]] which satisfies the conditions of theorem \ref{BrownRepresentabilityOnPresentableInfinityCategories}, and let $(H^\bullet, \delta)$ be a [[generalized cohomology]] functor on $\mathcal{C}$, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}. Then there exists a  [[spectrum object]] $E \in Stab(\mathcal{C})$ such that 

1. $H\bullet$ is degreewise [[representable functor|represented]] by $E$:

   $$
     H^\bullet \simeq Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,E_\bullet)
     \,,
   $$

1. the [[suspension isomorphism]] $\delta$ is given by the structure morphisms $\tilde \sigma_n \colon E_n \to \Omega E_{n+1}$ of the spectrum, in that

   $$
     \delta 
       \colon
     H^n(-)
      \simeq
     Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,E_n)
      \stackrel{Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,\tilde\sigma_n) }{\longrightarrow}
     Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,\Omega E_{n+1})
       \simeq
     Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma (-), E_{n+1})
       \simeq
     H^{n+1}(\Sigma(-))
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Via prop. \ref{CohomologyFunctorOnInfinityCategoryIsBrownFunctor}, theorem \ref{BrownRepresentabilityOnPresentableInfinityCategories} gives the first clause. With this, the second clause follows by the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma]].

### For triangulated categories and model categories

For [[triangulated categories]]  asdiscussion is in ([Neeman 96](#Neeman96)).


Let $C$ be a [[simplicial model category]] with a [[zero object]] and such that there is a [[set]] $S$ of [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]] [[compact objects]] such that the [[weak equivalences]] in $C$ are precisely the $S$-[[local morphisms]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**(Jardine)**

Let $F : C^{op} \to Set_{*}$ be a [[homotopical functor]] to the category of pointed sets on $C^{op}$ such that

1. $F$ preserves small [[coproducts]] of cofibrant objects (including preserving the [[zero object]]).

1. **(Mayer-Vietoris property)** $F$ takes any [[pushout]] diagram

   $$
     \array{
       A &\to& X
       \\
       \downarrow^i && \downarrow 
       \\
       B &\to& B \coprod_A X,
     }
   $$  

   with all objects cofibrant and $i$ a cofibration, to a [[weak pullback]].

Then $F$ is [[representable functor|representable]].

=--


([Jardine 09](#Jardine09))

This follows essentially immediately from Theorem \ref{Categorical} applied to $Ho(C)$.  Jardine also proves a more refined version.


### For $RO(G)$-graded equivariant cohomology
 {#ForEquivariantCohomology}

The generalization of the Brown representability theorem to [[equivariant cohomology]] says that [[RO(G)-grading|RO(G)-graded]] equivariant cohomology is represented by [[genuine G-spectra]] (e.g. [May 96, chapter XIII.3](#May96)).
