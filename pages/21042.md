## Idea

A **function machine** is a generalization of [[neural networks]] to potentially infinite dimensional layers, motivated by the study of universal approximation of [[operators]] and [[functionals]] over abstract [[Banach spaces]]. 

## Definition
 {#Definition}
A function machine's layers is defined by the type of layers it is composed with.
