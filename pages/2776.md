## Idea ##

_Topological chiral homology_ is a generalization of [[Hochschild homology]]. Where Hochschild homology is given by [[(∞,1)-colimit]]s of functors constant on an $\infty$-algebra over a diagram that is an [[∞-groupoid]], topological chiral homology is given by colimits of constant functors over [[(∞,1)-categories]] of open subsets of a [[manifold]].

This generalizes the concept of _chiral homology_ by Beilinson-Drinfeld.

## Definition

For the moment see the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hochschild+cohomology#TopologicalChiralHomology">Topological chiral homology</a> at the entry on [[Hochschild homology]].

## Related concepts

The notion of topological chiral homology should be closely related to that of

* [[blob homology]]

* [[factorization algebra]]

and be related to concepts in

* [[AQFT]],
