## Idea

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]] a _prime factor_ is a [[prime number]] $p \in \mathbb{N}$ which divides $n$, hence such that there is $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $k \cdot p = n$.

The _prime factorization_ of a natural number is its expression entirely as a product of prime factors.
