## Idea

In the [[standard model of particle physics]] (specifically in [[QCD]]), a _baryon_ is [[bound state]] of three [[quarks]] via the [[strong nuclear force]]. Baryons are the "heavy" types of [[hardons]], the other being the [[mesonds]].  Examples of hadrons are [[protons]] and [[neutrons]].
