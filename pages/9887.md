## Idea

**Snaith's theorem** asserts that 

1. the [[K-theory spectrum]] for [[complex K-theory]] is the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] of the [[circle 2-group]] localized at the [[Bott element]] $\beta$:

   $$
     KU \simeq (\mathbb{S}[B U(1)])[\beta^{-1}]
     \,;
   $$

1. the [[periodic complex cobordism spectrum]] is the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] of the [[classifying space]] for stable [[complex vector bundles]] (the classifying space for [[topological K-theory]]) localized at the [[Bott element]] $\beta$:

   $$
     MU \simeq (\mathbb{S}[B U])[\beta^{-1}]
     \,.
   $$
