Robinson arithmetic (after Raphael M. Robinson) is a finitely axiomatized weakening of [[Peano arithmetic]] in which the induction schema is dropped and minimal axioms remain. 

## Definition 

Robinson arithmetic, also denoted by Q, is a [[first-order theory]] whose [[signature]] is that of first-order Peano arithmetic: it consists of a constant $0$, an unary function symbol $s$, and binary function symbols $+, \cdot$. The axioms are 

1. $\forall_x \neg s(x) = 0$; 

1. $\forall_{x, y} s(x) = s(y) \Rightarrow x = y$; 

1. $\forall_x x = 0 \vee \exists_y x = s(y)$; 

1. $\forall_x x + 0 = x$, 

1. $\forall_{x, y} x + s(y) = s(x+y)$; 

1. $\forall_x x \cdot 0 = 0$; 

1. $\forall_{x, y} x \cdot s(y) = x \cdot y + x$. 

There is no induction scheme. Despite the considerable weakening of what can be proved, the formulas are the same as in Peano arithmetic, and all the background number theory (Chinese remainder theorem and the like) needed to develop G&ouml;del codings, [[incompleteness theorems]], and so on is still there. In some sense the axioms are a minimal set needed to carry out this program (and in fact this was in large part the motivation for Robinson). 

Unlike the case for Peano arithmetic, system Q admits tractable computable nonstandard models.
