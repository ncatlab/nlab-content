## Idea

In analogy to how the [[Lie group]] [[spin^c]] is obtained by twisting the lift through the second stage of the [[Whitehead tower]] of $\mathbf{B}O$ by the [[first Chern class]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B}(SO \times U(1))
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{w}_1 - \mathbf{c}_1}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

there is a similar twist by the [[second Chern class]] of the lift through the next stage of the Whitehead tower

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}String^{\mathbf{c}_2} &\to& \mathbf{B}(Spin \times SU(n))
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{c}_2}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$
