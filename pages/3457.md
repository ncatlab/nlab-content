An étale map is a local [[isomorphism]].  Exactly what this means depends on what 'local' means.  Presumably (?) it makes sense in any [[site]]; the concept is usually found in places with a geometric or topological flavour:

*  An étale map between [[topological spaces]] is a local [[homeomorphism]]; see [[étalé space]] (which is the total space of such a map viewed as a [[bundle]]).
*  An étale map between [[smooth spaces]] is a local [[diffeomorphisms]], very similar to (and a special case of) the above.
*  For an étale map between [[schemes]], see [[étale morphism]].
*  Étale maps between [[analytic space]]s are closely related to étale maps between schemes, while also a special case of an étale map between smooth spaces.

Zoran: I do not understand this statement. Analytic spaces have a different structure sheaf; in general nilpotent elements are allowed. This is additional structure not present in theory of smooth spaces.

However, the term is also used in a [[duality|dual]] sense in [[ring]] theory:

*  An étale map between [[commutative rings]] is a ring homomorphism with the property that, when viewed as a morphism between [[affine schemes]], it is étale.  See [this comment by Harry Gindi](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=716&page=1#Item_25) for a purely ring-theoretic characterisation.

   Zoran: that is the infinitesimal lifting property for smooth morphisms, need an additional condition in general. 

*  Étale maps between noncommutative [[rings]] have also been considered.
