## Idea

The notion of _étale map_ is an abstraction of that of [[local homeomorphism]] in [[topology]].   The concept is usually found in places with a geometric or topological flavour.

## Examples

### Between topological spaces

An étale map between [[topological spaces]] is a  [[local homeomorphism]]; see [[étalé space]] (which is the total space of such a map viewed as a [[bundle]]).

### Between smooth manifolds

An étale map between [[smooth spaces]] is a  [[local diffeomorphisms]], which is in particular a [[local homeomorphism]] on the underlying [[topological spaces]].

### Between schemes (affine schemes / rings)

For an étale map between [[schemes]] see _[[étale morphism of schemes]]_.

Restricted to [[affine schemes]], this yields, [[Isbell duality|dually]], a notion of étale morphisms between [[rings]]. Étale maps between noncommutative [[rings]] have also been considered.


### Between analytic spaces

*  Étale maps between [[analytic spaces]] are closely related to étale maps between schemes, while also a special case of an étale map between smooth spaces.

Zoran: I do not understand this statement. Analytic spaces have a different structure sheaf; in general nilpotent elements are allowed. This is additional structure not present in theory of smooth spaces.

## Axiomatization

The idea of _étale morphisms_ can be axiomatized in any [[topos]]. This idea goes back to lectures by [[André Joyal]] in the 1970s. See ([Joyal-Moerdijk 1994](#JoyalMoerdijk)) and ([Dubuc 2000](#Dubuc)).
