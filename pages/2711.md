## Idea

An **element** of a [[set]] is a thing which "belongs to," or "is an element of," that set.

The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in [[foundations of mathematics|foundational]] [[set theories]] in which "set" is an undefined term.  In "definitional" set theories, where "set" is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same "something else."

If sets (or [[setoids]]) are regarded as the [[semantics]] of some [[type theory]], then an element of a set is the interpretation of a [[term]] of some [[type]].


## Generalisations

* A [[term]] of some [[type]].
*  a [[global element]] of any object in any category or higher category with a [[terminal object]].
*  a [[generalised element]] of any object in any category or higher category;
*  a [[morphism]] in a category, a different sort of element from an object;
*  An [[object]] in a [[category]];
*  in general, $k$-[[k-morphism|morphisms]] or $k$-cells in an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]];
