## Idea

The _Witten genus_ is a [[genus]] that has can be undeerstood roughly as being the [[index]] of a [[Dirac operator]] on a [[loop space]].

As such it can be understood as the [[partition function]] of a an $N=1$ $d=2$ super[[CFT]] (the "[[heterotic string]]") and as such was introduced by [[Edward Witten]].


Formalizations of this construction exist both in [[AQFT]]-type and in [[FQFT]]-type [[quantum field theory]]:

* [[Stephan Stolz]] and [[Peter Teichner]] have proposed and developed a formalization in terms of 
  [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory]]

* xxx, yyy, and zzz have constructed [[factorization algebra]]s,
  that realize the Witten genus
