## Idea


Given a [[topological manifold]] $X$, its __mapping class group__ $MCG(X)$ is the [[group]] of [[isotopy]] classes of orientation preserving [[homeomorphisms]] $X\to X$. 

Often this is considered specifically for $X$ a [[Riemann surface]] with punctures in which case
a central role is played by [[Dehn twists]]. 

The mapping class group is of importance in many areas of geometry including study of [[Teichmüller spaces]], of [[moduli spaces]] of surfaces, of [[automorphisms]] of [[free groups]] and in geometric and [[combinatorial group theory]], hyperbolic geometry and so on. Some of the key contributors were [[Max Dehn]], [[Jakob Nielsen]], [[William Thurston]], [[David Mumford]]. Recent proof of the related Mumford conjecture has been accomplished by Madsen and Weiss.

## Definition

For $\mathbf{Aut}(X)$ the [[automorphism group]] of the [[manifold]] formed in [[Euclidean-topological infinity-groupoids|Euclidean topological geometry]], hence equipped with its canonical structure of a [[topological group]]. Let furthermore $\mathbf{Aut}_0(X) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{Aut}(X)$ be the inclusion of the connected component of the identity.

Then

$$
  \mathbf{MCG}(X) \coloneqq \mathbf{Aut}(X)/\mathbf{Aut}_0(X)
$$

is the corresponding [[coset space]]/[[quotient group]]. In other words, the mapping class group is the group of [[diffeomorphisms]] of $X$ onto itself, modulo [[isotopy]]. 

If $X$ is a manifold with boundary $\partial X$, then it is usual to consider automorphisms which restrict to the identity on the boundary. 

## Properties

### For 2-dimensional surfaces

The [[classifying spaces]] of mapping class groups for 2-[[dimension]]al [[manifolds]] are encoded combinatorially in the [[geometric realization]] of a [[category]] of [[ribbon graphs]]. See there for details. 

One of the classical results is that the mapping class group of the torus $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}^2 \cong (S^1)^2$ is isomorphic to $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}$ (more generally, $MCG(\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n) \cong SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$). Certain generators called Dehn twists may be visualized as cutting a torus along a circle $\{a\} \times S^1$ (or $S^1 \times \{b\}$), thus producing a cylinder, then twisting one of the ends of the cylinder through $2\pi$ and reattaching the two ends. 

Another example is a 2-disk with $n$ punctures. The group of diffeomorphisms (fixing the boundary pointwise) modulo isotopy is the [[braid group]] $B_n$.
