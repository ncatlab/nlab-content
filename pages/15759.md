The **colored Jones polynomial** of a [[knot]] or [[link]] is a generalization of the [[Jones polynomial]]. The latter may be seen as 'colored' by the 2-dimensional representation of $SU(2)$, where the $N$-colored Jones polynomial $J_N(K, q)$ involves the irreducible $N$-dimensional representation.
