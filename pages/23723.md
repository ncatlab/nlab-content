## Definition

A **nuclear adjunction** is an adjunction that is both [[monadic adjunction|monadic]] and [[comonadic adjunction|comonadic]].

Consider an adjunction $F \dashv G$, generating a [[monad]] $T$ and a [[comonad]] $D$. Under minimal assumptions on the categories, there is an adjunction between the category of $T$-algebras, and the category of $D$-coalgebras, and this adjunction is nuclear.
