## Idea

For $R$ a [[ring]] and $N$ an $R$-[[module]] which is finitely [[generators and relations|generated]] over $R$ on $n$ generators, the _syzygies_ are the _[[generators and relations|relations]]_ between these generators. 

Higher order syzygies are relations between these relations, and so forth.

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[ring]], $N$ an $R$-[[module]] generated on $n$ generators. Write

$$
  R^n \to N
$$

for the canonical projection from the [[free module]] over $R$ on $n$ generators to $N$, which takes these generators to their image in $N$. 

The **module of syzygies** is the [[kernel]] of this morphism. This being a [[submodule]] of a [[free module]] it is itself free and hence the resulting [[exact sequence]] looks like

$$
  R^{n_1} \to R^{n} \to N
$$

relations/syzygies $\to$ generators $\to$ elements

Continuing in this way yields, under suitable assumptions on $R$, a [[projective resolution]] (actually a [[free resolution]]) of $N$ by syzygies and higher order syzygies.

$$
  \cdots \to R^{n_3} \to R^{n_2} \to R^{n_1} \to R^{n} \to N
  \,.
$$
