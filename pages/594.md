A **union** is a [[join]] of [[subset]]s or (more generally) [[subobject]]s.

This includes the traditional [[set theory|set-theoretic]] union of subsets of some ambient set; unions of completely arbitrary sets (unlike [[disjoint union]]s) are considered [[evil]].

A [[coherent category]] is one having well-behaved unions of subobjects.
