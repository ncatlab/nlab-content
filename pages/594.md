## Definition

A **union** is a [[join]] of [[subset]]s or (more generally) [[subobject]]s.  This includes the traditional [[set theory|set-theoretic]] union of subsets of some ambient set.

The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of [[intersection]]/[[meet]].

Unions of completely arbitrary sets make sense only in [[material set theory]], where their existence is guaranteed by the [[axiom of union]].  In [[structural set theory]], unions of arbitrary sets can generally be replaced by [[disjoint unions]].

A [[coherent category]] is one having well-behaved unions of subobjects.

## Properties

* For [[subsets]]: [[images preserve unions]], [[pre-images preserve unions and intersections]].
