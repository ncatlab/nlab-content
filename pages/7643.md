## Idea

An initial algebra is an [[initial object]] in a [[category]] (or [[higher category]]) of [[algebras]].

There are many meanings of 'algebra', so many meanings of 'initial algebra'.  Most cases are fairly vacuous, but we could probably list them here.  Some cases, however, are rather important and interesting in the topic of [[induction]] and [[recursion]]:
* [[initial algebra of an endofunctor]],
* [[initial algebra of a presentable (infinity,1)-monad]].


## Examples

List them here if you like:
