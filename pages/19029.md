## Definition

A [[differential form]] $\omega \in \Omega^n$ of homogeneous degree $n$ is said to be _decomposable_ if it is the [[wedge product]] of $n$ [[differential 1-form]] $(\alpha_k \in \Omega^1)_{k \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}$:

$$
  \omega = \alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha_n
$$

More generally in an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded-commutative algebra]] an element of homogeneous degree may be called _decomposable_ if it may be written as the product of elements of degree 1.
