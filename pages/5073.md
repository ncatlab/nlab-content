## Idea

An (open) **annulus** is a [[topological space]] that is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[disk]] with an interior point removed: $D^2 \setminus \{0\}$.

An often used  model for the corresponding closed annulus is the subspace $\{(x,y)\mid 1\leq x^2 + y^2 \leq 4\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, of the plane consisting of the point lying between a unit circle and a circle of radius 2, both centred on the origin.
