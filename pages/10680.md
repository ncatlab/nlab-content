
Андрей Николаевич Тихонов was a Russian mathematician and geophysicist, known for his contributions to [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]], but also [[mathematical physics]].

Concepts named after him include _[[Tychonoff space]]_, _[[Tychonoff product]]_, _[[Tychonoff's theorem]]_.

Beware that spelling varies, other common uses are _Tihonov_ and _Tikhonov_. The original _Тихонов_, becomes _Tihonov_ in the transliteration used in slavistics or _Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov_ in modern English (BGN/PCGN) transliteration. But notice that he himself originally published in German as _A.N. Tychonoff_ (e.g. [Tychonoff 30](#Tychonoff30), [Tychonoff 35](#Tychonoff35)).
