

In a [[symplectic vector space]] a **Lagrangian subspace** is a maximal [[isotropic subspace]]: 

a sub-[[vector space]] 

* on which the restriction of the [[symplectic form]] vanishes;

* and which has maximal [[dimension]] with this property.

Similarly for a [[symplectic manifold]]. See _[[Lagrangian submanifold]]_ .
