## Idea

In _$p$-adic homotopy theory_ one studies, for any [[prime number]] $p$, [[simply connected]] [[homotopy types]] (of [[topological spaces]]) all whose [[homotopy groups]] have the structure of  (finitely generated) [[modules]] over the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$ -- the _$p$-adic homotopy types_. The central theorem ([Mandell 01](#Mandell01)) says that the [[(∞,1)-category]] on $p$-adic homotopy types is [[sub-(∞,1)-category|faithfully embedded]] into the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[E-∞ algebras]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic]] $p$ ([[Rational and p-adic Homotopy Theory|Lurie, p. 70, cor. 3.5.15]]).

In this way $p$-adic homotopy theory is directly analogous to _[[rational homotopy theory]]_ with the [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$ replaced by the [[p-adic integers]].

The _[[fracture theorem]]_ says that under mild conditions, homotopy theory may be decomposed in a precise sense into rational homotopy theory and $p$-adic homotopy theory for each prime $p$.
