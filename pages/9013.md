## Definition

For $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ a [[monoidal 2-category]], is **Picard 3-group** is the [[3-group]] induced on the full sub-2-groupoid $PIC(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ on the objects that are invertible under the tensor product. 

If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is a [[braided monoidal 2-category]], then $PIC(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is a [[braided 3-group]]. If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal 2-category]], then $PIC(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is a [[abelian 3-group]].


## Examples

* For $R$ a [[commutative ring]] and $Alg_R$ the 2-category of [[associative algebras]] over $R$ and [[bimodules]] between them, the corresponding Picard 3-group may be thought of as that of [[line 2-bundles]] over $Spec R$. It has as [[homotopy groups]] the [[Brauer group]], the [[Picard group]] and the [[group of units]] of $R$.
