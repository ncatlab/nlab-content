## Definition

A [[functor]] $F\colon C \to D$ from a [[category]] $C$ to a category $D$ is called _full_ if for each pair of [[objects]] $x, y \in C$, the [[function]]
$$F\colon C(x,y) \to D(F(x), F(y))$$
between [[hom sets]] is [[surjective]].  

More abstractly, we may say a functor is full if it is [[k-surjective functor|1-surjective]] -- or, in simple terms, 'surjective on morphisms between given objects'.  (Note that a functor may be full without being surjective on morphisms, overall, since $F$ is allowed to not hit morphisms between objects that are not in the image of $F$.)

Fullness is most important for functors which are also [[faithful functor|faithful]], and full and faithful functors are often called _[[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]]_.  For ordinary functors this may sound odd, because there is no real sense in which "full" modifies "faithful."  However, in some contexts (such as for morphisms in a general [[2-category]]), there is a good notion of "full-and-faithful" or "fully faithful," but the right notion of "full" alone is not so clear.  "Fully faithful" is also sometimes abbreviated to "ff"; see also [[bo-ff factorization system]].

A [[subcategory]] is called a _[[full subcategory]]_ if its inclusion functor (which is automatically faithful) is also full, and any full and faithful functor exhibits an equivalence of its domain with a full subcategory of its codomain.
