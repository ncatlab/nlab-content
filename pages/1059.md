## Definition

A **strict epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] which is the joint [[coequalizer]] of all parallel pairs of [[morphism]]s that it coequalizes.  In other words, $f:B\to C$ is a strict epimorphism if it is the [[colimit]] of the (possibly large) diagram consisting of all [[parallel morphisms|parallel pairs]] $g,h:A \;\rightrightarrows\; B$ such that $f g = f h$.  Although the definition does not include this explicitly, it follows that $f$ is an [[epimorphism]]. A __strict monomorphism__ is a morphism such that its dual is strict epimorphism in the dual category.


## Relation to other epimorphism classes

If $C$ has [[pullback]]s, then any such $g,h$ factor uniquely through the [[kernel pair]] $r,s:ker(f) \;\rightrightarrows\; B$ of $f$, which is itself such a pair (that is, $f r = f s$).  Thus, for any $k:B\to D$, we have $k g = k h$ for all $g,h$ with $f g = f h$ if and only if $k r = k s$.  Therefore, $f$ is strict epi if and only if it is the coequalizer of its kernel pair, hence if and only if it is an [[effective epimorphism]] and a [[regular epimorphism]].  For this reason, some sources define "regular epimorphism" in a category without pullbacks to mean what we have called a "strict epimorphism."

It is easy to see that in _any_ category, any regular epimorphism is strict.  In a category without pullbacks, it seems that not every strict epimorphism need be regular.  However, every strict epimorphism is [[strong epimorphism|strong]], and hence [[extremal epimorphism|extremal]], for the same reason that any regular epimorphism is.


## Properties

If the composition $g\circ f$ is a strict epimorphism then $g$ is a strict epimorphism.
