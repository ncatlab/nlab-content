In May 2011 [[Graeme Segal]] gave a series of lectures on the topic of [[quantum field theory]] at the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics in Bonn.

* [[Graeme Segal]], _Three Roles of Quantum Field Theory_ , Felix Klein Lectures 2011, Bonn ([website](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/3372/))

  **Abstract** [[quantum field theory|Quantum field theory]] has many roles, and the lectures will be about three of them. The primary role is to provide a description of all of fundamental [[physics]] when [[gravity]] is firmly excluded. A second, at first surprising, role has emerged from [[string theory]], which is a theory of gravitation: it turns out that a two-dimensional field theory can be regarded as a generalized manifold, and in particular can be a model for [[space-time]].
