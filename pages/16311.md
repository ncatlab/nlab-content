## In philosophy

In [[philosophy]] a concept called _substance_ plays the central role in [[Spinoza's system]] and in [[Descartes]]'s thoughts ([LectHistPhil-Descartes](Lectures+on+the+History+of+Philosophy#DescartesSubstance)).

In [[Kant]]'s _critique of pure reason_ this appears as one of the _[[category (philosophy)|categories of pure thought]]_. Here "substance" is to go along with _substantial_, as opposede to _accidental_.

In [[Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_ this is claimed to be recovered from a more  fundamental "process" as "the final unity of essence and being" ([§1235](Science%20of%20Logic#1235)).
