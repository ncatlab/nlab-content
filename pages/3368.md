## Idea

An ordinary [[category]] is _[[idempotent complete category|idempotent complete]]_, aka _[[Karoubi envelope|Karoubi complete]]_ or _[[Cauchy completion|Cauchy complete]]_ , if every [[idempotent]] splits.  Since the splitting of an idempotent is a limit *or* colimit of that idempotent, any category with [[finitely complete category|all finite limits]] or [[finitely cocomplete category|all finite colimits]] is idempotent complete.

In an [[(∞,1)-category]] the idea is the same, except that the notion of *idempotent* is more complicated.  Instead of just requiring that $e\circ e = e$, we need an [[equivalence]] $e\circ e \simeq e$, together with higher coherence data saying that, for instance, the two derived equivalences $e\circ e\circ e \simeq e$ are equivalent, and so on up.  In particular, *being idempotent* is no longer a [[stuff, structure, property|property]] of a morphism, but *structure* on it.

It is still true that a splitting of an idempotent in an $(\infty,1)$-category is a limit or colimit of that idempotent (now regarded as a diagram with all its higher coherence data), but this limit is no longer a finite limit; thus an $(\infty,1)$-category can have all finite limits without being idempotent-complete.


## Definition

###### Definition

Let $Idem^+$ be the [[nerve]] of the [[walking structure|free 1-category containing a]] [[retraction]], with $e:X\to X$ the idempotent, $r:X\to Y$ the retraction, and $i:Y\to X$ the section (and $e = i r$ and $r i = 1_Y$).  Let $Idem$ be the similar nerve of the free 1-category containing an idempotent, which is the full sub-simplicial set of $Idem^+$ spanned by the object $X$.  Let $Ret$ be the image in $Idem^+$ of the 2-simplex $\Delta^2 \to Idem^+$ exhibiting the composite $r i = 1_Y$; thus $Ret$ is also the quotient of $\Delta^2$ that collapses the 1-face to a point.

###### Definition 

Let C be an $\infty$-category, incarnated as a [[quasi-category]].  

1.  An **idempotent morphism** in C is a map of simplicial sets $Idem \to C$. We will refer to $Fun(Idem, C)$ as the 
**$(\infty,1)$-category of idempotents** in $C$. 

1. A **weak retraction diagram** in $C$ is a [[homomorphism]] of [[simplicial sets]] $Ret \to C$. We refer to $Fun(Ret, C)$ as 
the **$(\infty,1)$-category of weak retraction diagrams** in $C$. 

1. A **strong retraction diagram** in $C$ is a map of simplicial sets $Idem^+ \to C$. We will refer to $Fun(Idem+, C)$ 
as the **$(\infty,1)$-category of strong retraction diagrams** in $C$.

###### Proposition

An idempotent diagram $F \colon Idem \to C$ is effective precisely if it admits an [[(∞,1)-limit]], equivalently if it admits an [[(∞,1)-colimit]].

## Properties

The following properties generalize those of idempotent-complete 1-categories.

###### Theorem

A [[small (∞,1)-category]] is idempotent-complete if and only if it is [[accessible (∞,1)-category|accessible]].

###### Theorem

For $C$ a [[small (∞,1)-category]] and $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]], the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] $C \to C' \hookrightarrow Ind_\kappa(C)$ with $C'$ the full subcategory on $\kappa$-[[compact object]]s exhibits $C'$ as the idempotent completion of $C$.

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 5.4.2.4]].


## Coherent vs incoherent idempotents

We may also ask how idempotent-completeness of $C$ is related to that of its [[homotopy category]] $h C$.  An idempotent in $h C$ is an "incoherent idempotent" in $C$, i.e. a map $e:X\to X$ such that $e \sim e^2$, but without any higher coherence conditions.  In this case we have:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**([[Higher Algebra|HA]] Lemma 1.2.4.6)**
If $C$ is [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable]], then $C$ is idempotent-complete (i.e. every coherent idempotent is effective) if and only if $h C$ is (as a 1-category).
=--

However, if $C$ is not stable, this is false.  The following counterexample in [[∞Gpd]] is constructed in Warning 1.2.4.8 of [[Higher Algebra|HA]].  Let $\lambda : G \to G$ be an injective but non-bijective group homomorphism such that $\lambda$ and $\lambda^2$ are conjugate.  (One such is obtained by letting $G$ be the group of endpoint-fixing homeomorphisms of $[0,1]$, with $\lambda(g)$ acting as a scaled version of $g$ on $[0,\frac 1 2]$ and the identity on $[\frac 1 2,1]$.  Then $\lambda(g) \circ h = h \circ \lambda^2(g)$ for any $h$ such that $h(t) = 2t$ for $t \in [0,\frac 1 4]$.)

Then $B\lambda : B G \to B G$ is homotopic to $B\lambda^2$, hence idempotent in the homotopy category.  If it could be lifted to a coherent idempotent, then the colimit of the diagram
$$B G \xrightarrow{B \lambda} B G \xrightarrow{B \lambda} BG \to \cdots$$
would be its splitting, and hence the map $B G \to \colim (B G\xrightarrow{B \lambda} B G \to\cdots)$ would have a [[section]].  Passing to fundamental groups, $G \to \colim (G\xrightarrow{\lambda} G \to\cdots)$ would also have a section; but this is impossible as $\lambda$ is injective but not surjective.

However, we do have the following:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
**([[Higher Algebra|HA]] Lemma 7.3.5.14 in older versions, [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] Proposition 4.4.5.20 in newer versions)**
A morphism $e$ in an $(\infty,1)$-category $C$ is idempotent (i.e. $e:\Delta^1 \to C$ extends to $Idem$) if and only if there is a homotopy $h : e \sim e^2$ such that $h\circ 1 \sim 1\circ h$.
=--

In other words, an incoherent idempotent can be fully coherentified as soon as it admits one additional coherence datum.
