
## Traditional

In [[differential geometry]] the _de Rham differential_ is the [[differential]] in the [[de Rham complex]], "exterior [[derivative]]" acting on [[differential forms]]. See there for more

## In cohesive homotopy theory

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] and write $T \mathbf{H}$ for its [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

Given a [[stable homotopy type]] $\hat E \in Stab(\mathbf{H})\hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}$ [[cohesion]] provides two objects 

$$
  \Pi_{dR} \Omega \hat E \,,\;\;  \flat_{dR}\Sigma \hat E
  \;\;
  \in Stab(\mathbf{H})
$$

which may be interpreted as [[de Rham complexes]] with [[coefficients]] in $\Pi(\flat_{dR} \Sigma \hat E)$, the first one restricted to negative degree, the second to non-negative degree. Moreover, there is a canonical map

$$
  \array{
    \Pi_{dR}\Omega \hat E && \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow} && \flat_{dR}\Sigma \hat E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\iota}}\searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta_{\hat E}}}
    \\
    && 
    \hat E
  }
$$

which interprets as the _de Rham differential_ $\mathbf{d}$. See at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_ for details.
