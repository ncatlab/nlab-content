An **indexed monoidal category** is a kind of [[indexed category]], consisting of a category $S$ and a [[pseudofunctor]] $S^{op} \to MonCat$, which we write as $A\mapsto (C^A, \otimes_A, I_A)$.  By the usual [[Grothendieck construction]], this pseudofunctor can be regarded as a [[fibration]].  And if $S$ has [[finite products]], then the "fiberwise" monoidal structures $\otimes_A$ can also be "Grothendieckified" into an "external product"
$$ \boxtimes\colon C^A \times C^B \to C^{A\times B}$$
defined by $M\boxtimes N = \pi_2^\ast M \otimes_{A\times B} \pi_1^\ast N$.  This makes the total category of the fibration a monoidal category and the fibration itself a strict monoidal functor (when $S$ has its cartesian monoidal structure); I call this a **monoidal fibration**.  Moreover, we can recover $\otimes_A$ from $\boxtimes$ via $M\otimes_A N = \Delta_A^\ast (M\boxtimes N)$, so the two structures have the same information.

Here are some examples:

* $S=Sets$, $C^A=$ $A$-indexed families of objects of $C$, for any monoidal category $C$.
* $S=Gpd$, $C^A=$ $A$-diagrams of objects of $C$
* $S=$ any category with pullbacks, $C^A = S/A$
* $S=Top$, $C^A=$ spectra parametrized over $A$
* $S=Grp$ or $TopGrp$, $C^A=$ sets or spaces with an action by $A$
* The homotopy category of any of the above equipped with a homotopy theory

In many cases, the reindexing functors $f^\ast\colon C^B \to C^A$ induced by a morphism $f\colon A\to B$ in $S$ all have left adjoints $f_!$.  If these left adjoints satisfy the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] for all pullback squares in $S$, then the indexed category is traditionally said to have **indexed coproducts**.  For many applications, though, we only need condition for a few pullback squares, which coincidentally (?) happen to be those that are pullbacks in any category with finite products (whether or not it even has all pullbacks).
