### Definition

A [[field]] $k$ is *formally real* if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied:

* There exists an [[total order]] on $k$ which makes $k$ into an [[ordered field]].

* $-1$ is not a sum of squares in $k$.

* The [[Witt group]] of $k$ is not torsion.

Due to the last property, formally real fields play a special rôle in the theory of [[Witt groups]] and in related fields such as [[motivic homotopy theory]].

A formally real field which does not have any proper formally real algebraic extension is a [[real closed field]]; such a field admits a unique ordering.

### Examples

* The field of [[real numbers]] is formally real, and even a [[real closed field]]

* The field $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is formally real

* Finite fields and algebraically closed fields are never formally real
