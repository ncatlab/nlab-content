## Idea

For $C$ a [[site]], a _sheaf of abelian groups_ on $C$ is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group object]] in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(C)$.

The [[category]] $Ab(Sh(C))$ of sheaves of abelian groups is an [[abelian category]] and hence serves as a context for [[homological algebra]] "parameterized over $C$". For the case that $C = *$ is the point, this is just [[Ab]] itself.

More generally, for $\mathcal{A}$ an [[abelian category]] one can consider $\mathcal{A}$-valued sheaves $Sh(C,\mathcal{A})$: **[[abelian sheaves]]**. For this to have good properties $\mathcal{A}$ has to be a [[Grothendieck category]].
