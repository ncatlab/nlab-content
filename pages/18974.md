## Idea

The "fundamental operations" on [[distributions]] ([[pullback of distributions]], [[product of distributions]]) are in general not [[continuous map|continuous]] in the [[subspace topology]], for subspaces where [[Hörmander's criterion]] is satisfied, of the canonical [[dual topological vector space]]-topology ("[[weak topology]]").  

There is however a pseudo-topology which respect to which the fundamental operations are continuous. This is due to [Hörmander 71, p. 125](#Hoermander71) and hence called the _Hörmander topology_.
