## Idea

The [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a [[Lie algebra]] naturally becomes a [[Hopf algebra]] in which all the elements of the original Lie algebra are [[primitive elements]]. The _Milnor-Moore theorem_ states conditions under which, conversely, any Hopf algebra generated by primitive elements is the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra structure on these elements.
