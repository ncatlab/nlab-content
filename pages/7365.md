## Idea

In [[type IIB supergravity]] the [[dilaton]]/string coupling $g_s$ and the degree-1 [[RR-field]] $C_0$ of the [[D(-1)-brane]] combine into a [[complex number|complex]] function

$$
  \tau := C_0 + i g_2
$$

which transforms under the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ [[S-duality]] $\subset$ [[U-duality]] as

$$
  \left(
  \array{
    a & b 
    \\
    c & d
  }
  \right)
  :
  \tau
    \mapsto
  \frac{a \tau + b}{c \tau + d}
  \,.
$$

This combined field is also called the **axio-dilaton**.

## Properties

* In [[F-theory]] the variation of the axio-dilaton determines an [[elliptic fibration]] which encodes non-perturbative [[vacua]] of type IIB string theory.
