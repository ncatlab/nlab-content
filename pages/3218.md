## Idea

Let $p:V\to M$ be a [[smooth vector bundle]]. Any smooth family of $k$-dimensional subspaces $W_m\subset p^{-1}(m)$ where $m\in M$ is called a _[[distribution of subspaces|distribution of k-dimensional subspaces]]_ in $V\to M$. If $V = TM$ is the [[tangent bundle]] of $M$ then we talk about distributions of tangent vectors. 

A distribution of [[tangent vectors]] is called _integrable_ if the [[Lie bracket]] of its [[sections]] is **involutive**, i.e. if $X,Y: M\to W\subset TM$ are two sections (vector fields belonging to the distribution) of $W\to M$ then the bracket $[X,Y]$ of these vector fields is also a section of $W$: $[X,Y]\in W$. 

More generally, if a vector bundle is equipped with the structure of a [[Lie algebroid]], then a [[distribution of subspaces]] is _integrable_ if its sections are closed under the given Lie bracket. This reduces to the previous case for the [[tangent Lie algebroid]].

## Properties

A basic result on integrability is the Frobenius theorem ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_theorem_%28differential_topology%29)) which relates involutivity to the integrability in the sense of partial differential equations. An examples are complex analytic manifolds which correspond exactly to complex manifolds with integrable almost complex structure. [[Courant algebroid]]s are a quite general tool to express the integrability of geometric structure including these as special cases.
