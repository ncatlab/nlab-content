## Idea

To a large extent, [[type theory]] and [[category theory]] overlap or are equivalent. One may view type theory as a formal [[syntax|syntactic]] language or _calculus_ for category theory, and conversely one may think of category theory as providing [[categorical semantics|semantics]] for type theory. 

## Theorems

We discuss here formalizations and proofs of the relation/equivalence between various flavors of type theories and the corresponding flavors of categories.

## References

A systematic relation between type theory and category theory is discussed in 

* [[Joachim Lambek]], P. Scott, _Introduction to higher order categorical logic_, Cambridge University Press (1986) .

Chapter II in that book establishes that $Lang$ and $Cont$ form an [[adjunction]] between [[toposes]] and [[type theories]] with [[product types]] (they do not consider [[dependent types]]).

The [[equivalence of categories]] between [[locally cartesian closed categories]] and [[dependent type theories]] is established in

The analogous statement relating [[homotopy type theory]] and [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-categories]] was conjectured around

The suggestion that with [[univalence]] this is refined to [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] appears around

A precise definition of [[elementary (infinity,1)-topos]] inspired by giving a natural equivalence to [[homotopy type theory]] with [[univalence]] was then proposed in
