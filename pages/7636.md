## Idea

To a large extent, [[type theory]] and [[category theory]] overlap or are equivalent, and more generally so are [[homotopy type theory]] and [[(∞,1)-category theory]]. One may view type theory as a formal [[syntax|syntactic]] language or _calculus_ for category theory, and conversely one may think of category theory as providing [[categorical semantics|semantics]] for type theory.

This ([Seely, theorem 6.3](#Seely)). 

We now discuss this in detail.

### Type theories

For definiteness, self-containedness and for references below, we say what a [[dependent type theory]] is, following ([Seely, def. 1.1](#Seely)).

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **[[dependent type theory]]** or **[[Martin-Löf type theory]]** $T$ is a _[[theory]]_ with some [[signature (in logic)]] of function symbols with values in types and in terms (...) subject to the following rules

1. **type formation rules** 

   1. $1$ is a type (the [[unit type]]);
  
   1. if $a, b$ are terms of type $A$, then $(a = b)$ is a type (the [[equality type]]);

  1. if $A$ and $B[x]$ are types, $B$ depending on a [[free variable]] of type $A$, then the following symbols are types

     1. $\prod_{a : A} B[a]$ ([dependent product]), written also $(A \to B)$ if $B[x]$ in fact does not depend on $x$;

     1. $\sum_{a : A} B[a]$ ([[dependent sum]]), written also $A \times B$ if $B[x]$ in fact does not depend on $x$;

1. **term formation rules**

   1. $* \in 1$ is a term of the [[unit type]];

   1. (...)

1. **equality rules**

   1. (...)

#### Category of contexts

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a [[dependent type theory]] $T$, its **[[category of contexts]]** $Con(T)$ is the category whose

* [[objects]] are the [[types]] of $T$;

* [[morphisms]] $f : A \to B$ are the [[terms]] $f$ of [[function type]] $A \to B$.

Composition is given in the evident way.

###### Proposition

$Con(T)$ has [[finite limits]] and is a [[cartesian closed category]].

=--

([Seely, prop. 3.1](#Seely))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Constructions are straightforward. We indicated some of them. 

Notice that all [[finite limits]] (as discussed there) are induced as soon as there are all [[pullbacks]] and [[equalizers]]. A [[pullback]] in $Con(T)$

$$
  \array{
    P &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{g}{\to}& C
  }
$$

is given by 

$$
  P \simeq \sum_{a : A} \sum_{b \in B} (f(a) = g(b))
  \,.
$$

The [[equalizer]]

$$
  P \to A \stackrel{\overset{f}{\to}}{\underset{g}{\to}} B
$$

is given by

$$
  P = \sum_{a : A} (f(a) = g(a))
  \,.
$$

Next, the [[internal hom]]/[[exponential object]] is given by [[function type]]

$$
  [A,B] \simeq (A \to B)
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

$Con(T)$ is a [[locally cartesian closed category]].

=--

([Seely, theorem 3.2](#Seely))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Define the $Con(T)$-[[indexed category|indexed]] [[hyperdoctrine]] $P(T)$
by taking for $A \in Con(T)$ the category $P(T)(A)$ to have as objects the $A$-[[dependent types]] and as morphisms $(a : A \vdash X(a) : type) \to (a : A \vdash Y(a) : type)$ the terms of dependent function type $(a : A \vdash t : (X(a) \to Y(a)))$.

This is cartesian closed by the same kind of argument as in the previous proof. It is now sufficient to exhibit a compatible [[equivalence of categories]] with the [[slice category]] $Con(T)_{/A}$.

$$
  Con(T)_{/A}
   \simeq
  P(T)(A)
  \,.
$$

In one direction, send a morphism $f : X \to A$ to the dependent type 

$$
  a : A \vdash f^{-1}(a) \coloneqq \sum_{x : X} (a = f(x))
  \,.
$$

Conversely, for $a : A \vdash X(a)$ a dependent type, send it to the projection
$\sum_{a : A} X(a) \to A$.

One shows that this indeed gives an equivalence of categories which is compatible with base change ([Seely, prop. 3.2.4](#Seely)).

###### Definition

For $T$ a dependent type theory and $C$ a locally cartesian closed category, an **[[categorical semantics|interpretation]]** of $T$ in $C$ is a morphism of locally cartesian closed categories

$$
  Con(T) \to C
  \,.
$$

An interpretation of $T$ in another dependent type theory $T'$ is a morphism of locally cartesian closed categories

$$
  Con(T) \to Con(T')
  \,.
$$

#### Internal language

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given a [[locally cartesian closed category]] $C$, define the corresponding [[dependent type theory]] $Lang(C)$ as follows

* the non-dependent types of $Lang(C)$ are the [[objects]] of $C$;

* the $A$-dependent types are the morphisms $B \to A$;

* a context $x_1 : X , x_2 : X, \cdots , x_n : X_n$ is a tower of morphisms

  $$
    \array{
      X_n
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      \cdots
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      X_2
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      X_1
    }
  $$

* the terms $t[x_A] : B[x_A]$ are the [[sections]] $A \to B$ in $C_{/A}$

* the [[equality type]] $(x_A = y_A)$ is the [[diagonal]] $A \to A \times A$
