#Idea#

From a modern perspective, homological algebra is the study of those [[stable infinity-category|stable objects]] whose [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] is the [[derived category]] of an [[abelian category]].

So homological algebra studies in particular the [[homology]] of [[chain complex]]es in [[abelian category|abelian categories]] -- therefore the name.

The most refined 1-categorical approximation to the right context in which such [[chain complex]]es live is axiomatized by the structure of a [[triangulated category]]. The true context however is the corresponding [[stable infinity-category]], of which the triangulated category in question is just the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]].
