## Idea ##

From a modern perspective, homological algebra is the study of algebraic objects, (such as groups, rings or Lie algebras, or sheaves of such objects), by 'resolving them', replacing them by more [[stable infinity-category|stable objects]] whose [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] is the [[derived category]] of an [[abelian category]]. 

Functors between the original algebraic objects lead to [[derived functor]]s between the [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]], and much effort is devoted to the study of those derived functors, and the interpretation of their properties in terms of structure  of the original algebraic objects.

There are variants of the above idea that handle more non-linear phenomena.  These include non-Abelian (co)homology and crossed and quadratic versions that use a small degree of non-linearity in the models.  These latter theories make extensive use of techniques from [[homotopical algebra]] in the wide sense of that term and simplicial methods to avoid the crushing of homotopical information that can occur when passing to chain complexes.

Homological algebra thus studies, in particular, the [[homology]] of [[chain complex]]es in [[abelian category|abelian categories]] -- therefore the name.

One of the most refined 1-categorical approximations to the context in which such [[chain complex]]es live is a derived category with the structure of a [[triangulated category]]. Perhaps better contexts are frameworks in which higher coherences are better taken care of, like $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-category|categories]], [[dg-category|DG-categories]] and [[stable ∞-categories]]. There are enriched versions of derived categories which have any of the 3 mentioned higher structures. For the corresponding [[stable ∞-category]], the derived category is just the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]]. It may be possibly enriched by derived Kan extensions as in the theory of [[derivateur|dérivateurs]].
