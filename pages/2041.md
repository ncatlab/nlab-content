#Definition#

A **germ** is an element in a [[stalk]] of a [[sheaf]].   Exactly what this means depends on which sheaf one is considering.

This general description of what a germ of some sheaf at some point is can be extracted from [[stalk]], although that article is pretty abstract right now.


More generally, the notion of [[stalk]] makes sense in any [[topos]] that need not be a [[Grothendieck topos]] [[category of sheaves|of sheaves]] by way of the notion of [[point of a topos]]. Generally a germ is an element in the stalk of an object of a [[topos]] over some [[point of a topos|point of the topos]].


# Examples #

For example, take the sheaf of continuous (say, real-valued) functions on some space $X$.  Then every [[partial function]] $f$ defined on a [[neighbourhood]] of any given point $a$ in $X$ defines a germ at $a$.  Furthermore, the germ of $f$ equals the germ of $g$ if and only if $f = g$ on some neighbourhood $U$ of $a$; note that $U$ must be contained in the intersection of the domains of $f$ and $g$, but it may be smaller yet.
