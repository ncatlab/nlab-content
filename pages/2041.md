A **germ** is an element in a [[stalk]] of a [[sheaf]].  Exactly what this means depends on which sheaf one is considering.

For example, take the sheaf of continuous (say, real-valued) functions on some space $X$.  Then every [[partial function]] $f$ defined on a [[neighbourhood]] of any given point $a$ in $X$ defines a germ at $a$.  Furthermore, the germ of $f$ equals the germ of $g$ if and only if $f = g$ on some neighbourhood $U$ of $a$; note that $U$ must be contained in the intersection of the domains of $f$ and $g$, but it may be smaller yet.

The general description of what a germ of some sheaf at some point is can be extracted from [[stalk]], although that article is pretty abstract right now.
