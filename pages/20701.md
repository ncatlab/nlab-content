## Idea

The _empty graph_ is the [[graph]] with [[empty set]] of [[vertices]] and [[empty set]] of [[edges]].

## Properties

The empty graph is the [[initial object]] in any reasonable [[category]] of [[graphs]] (such as a [[category of simple graphs]]).

The [[free category]] on the empty graph is the [[empty category]].
