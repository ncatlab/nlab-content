__Y-system__ and __T-system__ are two related classes of algebraic relations associated with [[affine Lie algebra]]s and can be considered as encoding certain [[integrable system]]s. Y-system can be considered as a system of [[difference equation]]s of special type. The elements of the T-system satisfy discrete Hirota equations.

Y-system has a remarkable connection to [[cluster algebra]]s:

Y-systems are relevant for integrability phenomena in superstring theory and in relation to study of spectrum of N=4 SUSY Zang-Mills theory. See survey
