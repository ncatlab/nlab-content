A __normed division algebra__ is a [[Banach algebra]] that is also a [[division algebra]].

Note that, while the norm in a Banach algebra is normally only submultiplicative ($\|x y\| \leq \|x\| \|y\|$), the norm in a normed division algebra must be multiplicative ($\|x y\| = \|x\| \|y\|$).  Accordingly, this norm is considered to be an [[absolute value]] and often written $|{-}|$ instead of $\|{-}\|$.  There is also a converse: if the norm on a Banach algebra is multiplicative (including $\|1\| = 1$), then it must be a division algebra.  While the term 'normed division algebra' does not seem to include the [[complete space|completeness]] condition of a Banach algebra, in fact the only examples have finite dimension and are therefore complete.

The [[generalized the|only]] normed division algebra over the [[complex numbers]] is the algebra of complex numbers themselves.  Up to [[isomorphism]], there are exactly four finite-dimensional normed division algebras over the [[real numbers]]:

*  $\mathbb{R}$, the algebra of real numbers themselves,
*  $\mathbb{C}$, the algebra of [[complex numbers]],
*  $\mathbb{H}$, the algebra of [[quaternion]]s,
*  $\mathbb{O}$, the algebra of [[octonion]]s.

Each of these is produced from the previous one by the [[Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction]]; when applied to $\mathbb{O}$, this construction produces the algebra of [[sedenion]]s, which do *not* form a division algebra.

The Cayley--Dickson construction applies to an algebra with [[involution]]; by the abstract nonsense of that construction, we can see that the four normed division algebras above have these properties:

*  $\mathbb{R}$ is [[associative algebra|associative]], [[commutative algebra|commutative]], and with trivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{C}$ is associative and commutative but has nontrivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{H}$ is associative but noncommutative and with nontrivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{O}$ is neither associative, commutative, nor with trivial involution.

However, these algebras do all have some useful algebraic properties; in particular, they are all [[alternative algebra|alternative]] (a weak version of associativity).

A __normed field__ is a commutative normed division algebra; it follows from the preceding that the only normed fields that contain $\mathbb{R}$ are $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$.
