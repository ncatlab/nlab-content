# Normed division algebras

## Idea

A normed division algebra is a generalisation of the [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], [[quaternions]], and [[octonions]].  Amazingly, there are no other examples!


## Definition

A __normed division algebra__ is equivalently

* a [[normed algebra]] $(A, \|-\|)$ with multiplicative norm ([[absolute value]]  $\| a \cdot b \| = \| a \| \cdot \| b \|$);

* a [[Banach algebra]] that is also a [[division algebra]]:

* an [[alternative algebra]] that is a [[division algebra]].

While the [[norm]] in a [[Banach algebra]] is in general only submultiplicative (${\|x y\|} \leq {\|x\|} {\|y\|}$), the norm in a normed division algebra must be multiplicative (${\|x y\|} = {\|x\|} {\|y\|}$).  Accordingly, this norm is considered to be an [[absolute value]] and often written ${|{-}|}$ instead of ${\|{-}\|}$.  There is also a converse: if the norm on a Banach algebra is multiplicative (including ${\|1\|} = 1$), then it must be a division algebra.  While the term 'normed division algebra' does not seem to include the [[complete space|completeness]] condition of a Banach algebra, in fact the only examples have finite [[dimension]] and are therefore complete.


## Properties

### Classification

Over the [[complex numebrs]],  [[generalized the|the]] only normed division algebra is the algebra of complex numbers themselves.  

Over the [[real numebrs]] there are, up to [[isomorphism]], exactly four finite-dimensional normed division algebras :

*  $\mathbb{R}$, the algebra of [[real numbers]],
*  $\mathbb{C}$, the algebra of [[complex numbers]],
*  $\mathbb{H}$, the algebra of [[quaternions]],
*  $\mathbb{O}$, the algebra of [[octonions]].

Each of these is produced from the previous one by the [[Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction]]; when applied to $\mathbb{O}$, this construction produces the algebra of [[sedenions]], which do *not* form a division algebra.

The Cayley--Dickson construction applies to an algebra with [[involution]]; by the abstract nonsense of that construction, we can see that the four normed division algebras above have these properties:

*  $\mathbb{R}$ is [[associative algebra|associative]], [[commutative algebra|commutative]], and with trivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{C}$ is associative and commutative but has nontrivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{H}$ is associative but noncommutative and with nontrivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{O}$ is neither associative, commutative, nor with trivial involution.

However, these algebras do all have some useful algebraic properties; in particular, they are all [[alternative algebra|alternative]] (a weak version of associativity).  They are also all [[composition algebra]]s.

A __[[normed field]]__ is a commutative normed division algebra; it follows from the preceding that the only normed fields over $\mathbb{R}$ are $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ (e.g. [Tornheim 52](#Tornheim52)).
