## Idea

A normed division algebra is a [[not-necessarily associative algebra]], over some [[ground field]], that is both a [[division algebra]] as well as a multiplicatively [[normed algebra]]. 

It turns out that over the [[real numbers]] there are precisely only four normed division algebras up to [[isomorphism]]: the algebras of 

1. [[real numbers]], 

1. [[complex numbers]], 

1. [[quaternions]], 

1. [[octonions]].

In this sense real normed division algebras may be thought of as a natural generalization of the more familiar real and complex numbers. 

Moreover, if one regards the real numbers as a [[star-algebra]], then each stepin this sequence is given by applying the [[Cayley-Dickson construction]]. Applied to the [[octonions]] it yields the [[sedenions]], which however are no longer a [[division algebra]].

This classification turns out to closely connect to various other systems of exceptional structures in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]: 

* The _[[Hopf invariant one theorem]]_ says that the only [[continuous functions]] between [[spheres]] of the form $S^{2n-1}\to S^n$ whose [[Hopf invariant]] is equal to 1 are the [[Hopf constructions]] on the four real normed division algebras, namely 

   1. the [[real Hopf fibration]];

   1. the [[complex Hopf fibration]];

   1. the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]];

   1. the [[octonionic Hopf fibration]].

* Patterns related to [[Majorana spinors]] in [[spin geometry]] are intimately related to the four normed division algebras, and, induced by this, so is the classification of _[[supersymmetry]]_in the form of [[super Poincaré Lie algebras]] and [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] (which are built from these real spin representations). For more on this see at _[[supersymmetry and division algebras]]_.

(Moreover, apparently these two items are not unrelated, see [[schreiber:Equivariant cohomology of M2/M5-branes|here]]).


## Definition

A __normed division algebra__ is 

* a [[division algebra]];

* that is also a [[Banach algebra]].

While the [[norm]] in a [[Banach algebra]] is in general only submultiplicative (${\|x y\|} \leq {\|x\|} {\|y\|}$), the norm in a normed division algebra must be multiplicative (${\|x y\|} = {\|x\|} {\|y\|}$).  Accordingly, this norm is considered to be an [[absolute value]] 
and often written ${|{-}|}$ instead of ${\|{-}\|}$.  There is also a converse: if the norm on a Banach algebra is multiplicative (including ${\|1\|} = 1$), then it must be a division algebra.  While the term 'normed division algebra' does not seem to include the [[complete space|completeness]] condition of a Banach algebra, in fact the only examples have finite [[dimension]] and are therefore complete.

Accordingly, a normed division algebras is in particular a division [[composition algebra]].



## Properties

### Classification

Over the [[complex numbers]],  [[generalized the|the]] only normed division algebra is the algebra of complex numbers themselves.  

The [[Hurwitz theorem]] says that over the [[real numbers]] there are, up to [[isomorphism]], exactly four finite-dimensional normed division algebras :

*  $\mathbb{R}$, the algebra of [[real numbers]],
*  $\mathbb{C}$, the algebra of [[complex numbers]],
*  $\mathbb{H}$, the algebra of [[quaternions]],
*  $\mathbb{O}$, the algebra of [[octonions]].

Each of these is produced from the previous one by the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]]; when applied to $\mathbb{O}$, this construction produces the algebra of [[sedenions]], which do *not* form a division algebra.

The Cayley--Dickson construction applies to an algebra with [[involution]]; by the abstract nonsense of that construction, we can see that the four normed division algebras above have these properties:

*  $\mathbb{R}$ is [[associative algebra|associative]], [[commutative algebra|commutative]], and with trivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{C}$ is associative and commutative but has nontrivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{H}$ is associative but noncommutative and with nontrivial involution,
*  $\mathbb{O}$ is neither associative, commutative, nor with trivial involution.

However, these algebras do all have some useful algebraic properties; in particular, they are all [[alternative algebra|alternative]] (a weak version of associativity).  They are also all [[composition algebra]]s.

A __[[normed field]]__ is a commutative normed division algebra; it follows from the preceding that the only normed fields over $\mathbb{R}$ are $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ (e.g. [Tornheim 52](#Tornheim52)).

### Automorphisms
 {#Automorphisms}

The [[automorphism groups]] of the real normed division algebras, as [[normed algebras]], are

* $Aut(\mathbb{R}) = 1$, the [[trivial group]]

* $Aut(\mathbb{C}) = \mathbb{Z}/2$ the [[group of order 2]], acting by [[complex conjugation]];

* $Aut(\mathbb{H}) = SO(3)$, the [[special orthogonal group]] acting via its canonical representaiton  on the 3-dimensional space of imaginary octonions;

* $Aut(\mathbb{O}) = G_2$, the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2]].

### Relation to H-space structures on sphere (Hopf invariant one)

The [[Hopf invariant one theorem]] says that the [[spheres]] carrying [[H-space]] structure are precisely the unit spheres in one of the normed division algebras
