This is an entry on the notion of **complex of groups** introduced by [[André Haefliger]] and [[Jon Corson]] as a higher dimensional generalisation of the Bass-Serre theory of [[graphs of groups]]. (It does _not_ refer to the idea of chain complexes of groups, i.e., [[chain complexes]] in the usual sense, except that the groups involved are not assumed to be abelian.) 

##Idea

A complex of groups is a diagram of groups, homomorphisms and conjugations, corresponding, abstractly, to the system of inclusions of the [[stabiliser]] subgroups of an action of a group on a [[simplicial cell complex]]. If the complex is 1-dimensional one gets a [[graph of groups]].

##Definition: (to come later).

## Complexes of groups as pseudofunctors.
