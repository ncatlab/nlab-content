## Idea

Historically, there have been [[foundations]] which do not take the notion of [[set]] to be the fundamental notion. These include [[preset]] theories over [[first order logic]] such as [[SEAR#eqfree|certain presentations of SEAR]], as well as [[type theories]] like [[MLTT]] and [[cubical type theory]]. In such theories, there have been multiple proposed definitions of what a [[set]] should be. These include:

* An [[h-set]] (as common in [[cubical type theory]])
* A preset/type with an [[equivalence relation]]/[[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preorder]] (as common in preset theories)
* An h-set with an [[equivalence relation]]/[[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preorder]] (as common in [[MLTT]] without the [[quotient set]] [[higher inductive type]])
* A [[Bishop set]] (as common in [[Errett Bishop]]'s [[Bishop's constructive mathematics|branch of constructive mathematics]])
* A [[setoid]] (name used in multiple different foundations for different notions)

In [[homotopy type theory]] (and more generally in any [[intensional type theory]]), all these definitions are valid definitions of "sets", but they lead to different structures which behave differently from each other. This article is dedicated to distinguishing between the different notions of sets which have popped up throughout history, in the context of homotopy type theory. 

## Definitions

A **[[proposition]]** is a type $A$ such that for all elements $a:A$ and $b:A$ there is an element $p(a, b):a =_A b$. An **[[h-set]]** is a type $A$ where every identity type $a =_A b$ is an proposition for all elements $a:A$ and $b:A$. 

We take the approach in [CapriottiKraus17](#CapriottiKraus17) in defining a **[[graph]]** $A \coloneqq (A_0, A_1)$ to be a type $A_0$ with a type family $A_1(a, b)$ indexed by elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$. While not defined in CapriottiKraus17, we could continue to borrow from graph theory terminology and call  the type family $A_1$ the **[[edge]] type family** of a graph. 

The edge type family $A_1$ is 

* **transitive** if it comes with a family of functions
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(A_1(a, b) \times A_1(b, c)) \to A_1(a, c)$$

* **symmetric** if it comes with a family of functions
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, b):A_1(a, b)\to A_1(b, a)$$

* **reflexive** if it comes with a family of elements
$$\mathrm{refl}(a):A_1(a, a)$$

* a **[[relation]]** if every type $A_1(a, b)$ is an propositon. 

The graph $(A_0, A_1)$ is similarly called 

* **transitive** if its edge type family is transitive

* **symmetric** if its edge type family is symmetric

* **reflexive** if its edge type family is reflexive

A **[[Bishop set]]** or **[[setoid]]** $(A_0, A_1,\mathrm{trans}, \mathrm{sym}, \mathrm{refl})$ is a reflexive, symmetric, transitive graph. Historically in type theory $A_1$ was called an "equivalence relation", but the term "relation" now only refers to edge type families for which all its edge types are [[propositions]]. 

A **[[preorder]]** is a reflexive and transitive relation. An  **[[equivalence relation]]** is a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preorder]]. Thus, every type with an equivalence relation is a **symmetric preordered type**, and every h-set with an equivalence relation is a **symmetric [[proset]]**. 

Every symmetric preordered type is thus a Bishop set whose edge type family is a relation, or equivalently, if every edge type $A_1(a, b)$ is a propositon for elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$. 

Every h-set is equivalent to a type with an equivalence relation for which the canonical function
$$\mathrm{idtoequiv}(a, b):(a = b) \to A_1(a, b)$$
is an equivalence for all $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$.
