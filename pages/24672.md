## Idea

Historically, there have been [[foundations]] which do not take the notion of [[set]] to be the fundamental notion. These include [[preset]] theories over [[first order logic]] such as [[SEAR#eqfree|certain presentations of SEAR]], as well as [[type theories]] like [[MLTT]] and [[cubical type theory]]. In such theories, there have been multiple proposed definitions of what a [[set]] should be. These include:

* An [[h-set]] (as common in [[cubical type theory]] and [[Martin-Löf type theory]])
* A preset/type with an [[equivalence relation]]/[[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preorder]] (as common in preset theories)
* An h-set with an [[equivalence relation]]/[[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preorder]] 
* A [[Bishop set]] (as common in [[Errett Bishop]]'s [[Bishop's constructive mathematics|branch of constructive mathematics]])
* A [[setoid]] (as common in [[MLTT]] without the [[quotient set]] [[higher inductive type]])

In [[homotopy type theory]] (and more generally in any [[intensional type theory]]), all these definitions are valid definitions of "sets", but they lead to different structures which behave differently from each other. This article is dedicated to distinguishing between the different notions of sets which have popped up throughout history, in the context of homotopy type theory. 

## Definitions

A **[[proposition]]** is a type $A$ such that for all elements $a:A$ and $b:A$ there is an element $p(a, b):a =_A b$. An **[[h-set]]** is a type $A$ where every identity type $a =_A b$ is an proposition for all elements $a:A$ and $b:A$. 

We take the approach in [CapriottiKraus17](#CapriottiKraus17) in defining a **[[graph]]** $A \coloneqq (A_0, A_1)$ to be a type $A_0$ with a type family $A_1(a, b)$ indexed by elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$. While not defined in CapriottiKraus17, we could continue to borrow from graph theory terminology and call  the type family $A_1$ the **[[edge]] type family** of a graph. 

The edge type family $A_1$ is 

* **transitive** if it comes with a family of functions
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(A_1(a, b) \times A_1(b, c)) \to A_1(a, c)$$

* **symmetric** if it comes with a family of functions
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, b):A_1(a, b)\to A_1(b, a)$$

* **reflexive** if it comes with a family of elements
$$\mathrm{refl}(a):A_1(a, a)$$

* a **pseudo-relation** if every type $A_1(a, b)$ is an [[h-set]]. 

* a **[[relation]]** if every type $A_1(a, b)$ is an propositon. 

The graph $(A_0, A_1)$ is similarly called 

* **transitive** if its edge type family is transitive

* **symmetric** if its edge type family is symmetric

* **reflexive** if its edge type family is reflexive

A **[[Bishop set]]** $(A_0, A_1,\mathrm{trans}, \mathrm{sym}, \mathrm{refl})$ is a reflexive, symmetric, transitive graph. Historically in type theory $A_1$ was called an "equivalence relation", but the term "relation" in the context of [[homotopy type theory]] refers to edge type families for which all its edge types are [[propositions]]. 

A **[[pseudo-equivalence relation]]** is a reflexive, transitive, and symmetric pseudo-relation. A **[[setoid]]** is an h-set with a pseudo-equivalence relation. 

A **[[preorder]]** is a reflexive and transitive relation. An  **[[equivalence relation]]** is a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preorder]]. Thus, every type with an equivalence relation is a **symmetric preordered type**, and every h-set with an equivalence relation is a **symmetric [[proset]]**. 

Every symmetric preordered type is thus a Bishop set whose edge type family is a relation, or equivalently, if every edge type $A_1(a, b)$ is a propositon for elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$. 

Every symmetric proset is a setoid whose pseudo-equivalence relation is an [[equivalence relation]], or equivalently, if every edge type $A_1(a, b)$ is a propositon for elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$. 

Every h-set is equivalent to a type with an equivalence relation for which the canonical function
$$\mathrm{idtoequiv}(a, b):(a = b) \to A_1(a, b)$$
is an equivalence for all $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$. 

## Bijections, isomorphisms, and equivalences 

We begin with transitive, reflexive, and symmetric graphs 
$$A \coloneqq (A_0, A_1, \mathrm{trans}_A, \mathrm{refl}_A, \mathrm{sym}_A)$$ 
$$B \coloneqq (B_0, B_1, \mathrm{trans}_B, \mathrm{refl}_B, \mathrm{sym}_B)$$ 
$$C \coloneqq (C_0, C_1, \mathrm{trans}_C, \mathrm{refl}_C, \mathrm{sym}_C)$$ 
An extensional function between two transitive, reflexive, and symmetric graphs $f:A \to B$ consists of a function $f_0:A_0 \to B_0$ and for each object $a:A_0$ and $b:B_0$ a function $f_1(a, b):A_1(a, b) \to B_1(a, b)$. 

The identity function $id_A:A \to A$ is an extensional function which consists of the identity function $id_{A_0}:A_0 \to A_0$ for all elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$, the identity function $id_\equiv(a, b):(a \equiv_A b) \to (a \equiv_A b))$. 

The composition $g \circ f:A \to C$ of extensional functions $f:A \to B$ and $g:B \to C$ is defined as 
$$(g \circ f)_0 \coloneqq g_0 \circ f_0$$ 
and for all objects $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$, 
$$(g \circ f)_\equiv(a, b) \coloneqq g_equiv(f_0(a), f_0(b)) \circ f_equiv(a, b)$$

We naively copy the set-theoretic definitions of [[injection]], [[surjection]], and [[bijection]] over to type theory

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[injection]]** if for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):B_1(f_0(a), b)$ is a [[subsingleton]].

$$\mathrm{isInj}(f) \coloneqq \prod_{b:B_0} \mathrm{isProp}\left(\sum_{a:A} B_1(f_0(a), b)\right)$$

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[surjection]]** if for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):B_1(f_0(a), b)$ is inhabited.

$$\mathrm{isSurj}(f) \coloneqq \prod_{b:B_0} \left|\sum_{a:A} B_1(f_0(a), b)\right|$$

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[bijection]]** if for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):B_1(f_0(a), b)$ is a [[singleton]].

$$\mathrm{isBij}(f) \coloneqq \prod_{b:B_0} \mathrm{isContr}\left(\sum_{a:A} B_1(f_0(a), b)\right)$$

We also naively copy the categorical-theoretic definition of [[isomorphism]] over to type theory

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is an **[[isomorphism]]** if there exist an extensional function $g:B \to A$ with witnesses 
$$\mathrm{ret}_0(f, g):(g \circ f)_0 = id_{A_0}$$ 
$$\mathrm{sec}_0(f, g):(f \circ g)_0 = id_{B_0}$$ 
$$\mathrm{ret}_1(f, g)(a, b):(g \circ f)_1(a, b) = id_{A_1}(a, b)$$ 
$$\mathrm{sec}_1(f, g)(a, b):(f \circ g)_1(a, b) = id_{B_1}(a, b)$$

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is an **[[equivalence]]** if the function $f_0:A_0 \to B_0$ is an equivalence of types and for all elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$ the function $f_\equiv(a, b):(a \equiv_A b) \to (f_0(a) \equiv_B f_0(b))$ is an equivalence of types. 

The only notion of transitive, reflexive, and symmetric graphs for which the set-theoretic notions of [[bijection]], [[isomorphism]], and [[equivalence]] are all the same is an [[h-set]]: a transitive, reflexive, and symmetric graph whose hom-types are propositionally truncated, and which satisfy the [[Rezk completion]] condition

$$\mathrm{idToArr}:a =_{A_0} b \simeq A_1(a, b)$$

Isomorphism and equivalence of transitive, reflexive, and symmetric graphs are the same only when both the object type and the hom-types are [[h-sets]]. Bijection and equivalence of transitive, reflexive, and symmetric graphs are the same only in the presence of the Rezk completion condition on the structure. Combined with the requirement that the object type is an [[h-set]], this automatically means that the hom-types are [[h-propositions]], which makes the entire structure an [[h-set]]. 

This is why [[h-sets]] are simply called [[sets]] in [[homotopy type theory]] and more generally in [[intensional type theory]].
