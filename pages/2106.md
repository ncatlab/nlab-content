some random remarks:


* Symplectic geometry studies structures in [[differential geometry]] that are in some sense (namely [[T-duality|T-dual|]]) to [[complex geometry]]. The unification of both is achived by [[generalized complex geometry]].

* In its application to [[physics]], symplectic geometry is the fundamental mathematical language for [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and for [[geometric quantization]]. 

* A tremendous amount of insights into higher [[Lie theory]] ([[Lie groupoid]]s, [[Lie infinity-groupoid]]s, [[Lie infinity-algebroid]]s) has derived from [[Alan Weinstein]]'s long-term project of understanding the role of symplectic geometry in [[geometric quantization]]. See there for more details.

* There is a [[vertical categorification]] of symplectic geometry, called _multisymplectic geometry_ . For more on this see

  * [[John Baez]], [[Chris Rogers]], _Categorified Symplectic Geometry and the String Lie 2-Algebra_, ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4721))
