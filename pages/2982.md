### As a $Vect$-operad

Thee _associative operad_, denoted $Ass$ or $Assoc$, is often taken to be the [[Vect]]-[[operad]] whose [[algebra over an operad|algebras]] are precisely [[associative unital algebras]].

### As a $Set$-operad

As a [[Set]]-enriched non-symmetric operad, $Ass$ is the operad that has precisely one single $n$-ary operation for each $n$. In this context the algebras of $Ass$ are precisely [[monoid]]s. Accordingly, $Ass$ in this sense is the [[terminal object]] in the [[category]] of non-symmetric operads.

As a planar [[dendroidal set]], $Ass$ is the [[presheaf]] that assigns the singleton to every planar [[tree]] (hence also the [[terminal object]] in the category of dendroidal sets).

As a [[Set]]-enriched symmetric operad, $Ass$ is the operad that has the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ as its set of $n$-ary operations.
