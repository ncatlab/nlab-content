I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the Mathematics Institute of the [University of Göttingen](http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/20693.html), 
and a member of the [Courant Research Centre on Higher Order Structures in Mathematics](http://www.crcg.de/wiki/Main_Page).

My Ph.D thesis was on [[higher symplectic geometry]], and was supervised by [[John Baez]].
