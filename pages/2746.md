I'm a Ph.D student in mathematics at the University of California, Riverside. My advisor is [[John Baez]]. Roughly, my interests are in [[symplectic geometry|symplectic]]/[[Poisson manifold|Poisson]] geometry, [[higher algebra|higher algebraic]] and [[higher geometry|geometric structures]], and [[deformation theory]]. More information (publications, etc.) can be found [here](http://www.math.ucr.edu/~chris).
