I'm a Ph.D student in mathematics at the University of California, Riverside. My advisor is John Baez. Roughly, my interests are in symplectic/Poisson geometry, higher algebraic and geometric structures, and deformation theory. More information (publications, etc.) can be found [here](http://www.math.ucr.edu/~chris).
