## Idea ##

As shown in [[manifolds of mapping spaces]], the space of smooth maps from a sequentially compact [[Froelicher space|Fr&ouml;licher]] (or [[diffeological space|diffeological]] or [[Chen space|Chen]]) space is again a smooth manifold.  As such, its topology can be determined by considering how the charts are glued together.

In some cases, there is an easy method available to study the topology.  If the target manifold, say $M$, [[embedding|embeds]] as a [[submanifold]] of some [[convenient vector space]], say $V$, then $C^\infty(S,M)$ embeds as a submanifold of $C^\infty(S,V)$.  If the original embedding is as a closed submanifold, so is the embedding of mapping spaces.  This means that it is possible to propagate topological results down from $C^\infty(S,V)$ to $C^\infty(S,M)$.  Furthermore, if $M$ is a [[deformation retract]] of a neighbourhood of its image in $V$, then so is $C^\infty(S,M)$ in $C^\infty(S,V)$.

###### Theorem
Let $g \colon M \to N$ be an embedding of smooth manifolds.  Let $S$ be a sequentially compact Fr&ouml;licher space.  Then $C^\infty(S,g) \colon C^\infty(S,M) \to C^\infty(S,N)$ is an embedding of smooth manifolds.
