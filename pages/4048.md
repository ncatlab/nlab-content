## Idea

The _enriched Yoneda lemma_ is the generalization of the usual [[Yoneda lemma]] from [[category theory]] to [[enriched category theory]]. 

## Statement

We discuss here two forms of the Yoneda lemma. 

Let $V$ be a ([[locally small category|locally small]]) [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], so that $V$ is enriched in itself via its [[internal hom]].


### Weak form

 A _weak form_ of the enriched Yoneda lemma says that given a $V$-[[enriched functor]] $F: C \to V$ and an object $c$ of $C$, the _[[set]]_ of $V$-[[enriched natural transformation]]s $\alpha: \hom_C(c, -) \to F$ is in [[natural isomorphism|natural bijection]] with the set of elements of $F(c)$, i.e., the set of morphisms $I \to F(c)$, obtained by composition: 

$$I \stackrel{1_c}{\to} \hom_C(c, c) \stackrel{\alpha c}{\to} F(c)$$

### Strong form

Now suppose that $V$ is in addition (small-)complete (has all small [[limit]]s). Then, given a [[small category|small]] $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$ and $V$-[[enriched functor]]s $F, G: C \to V$, one may construct the _object_ of $V$-natural transformations as an enriched [[end]]: 

$$V^C(F, G) = \int_c V(F(c), G(c))$$ 

(which may in turn be expressed as an ordinary limit in $V$). This is the [[hom-object]] in the [[enriched functor category]].


A _strong form_ of the enriched Yoneda lemma specifies a $V$-[[natural isomorphism]]

$$V^C(\hom_C(c, -), F) \cong F(c).$$ 

This implies the weak form by applying the functor $\hom(I, -): V \to Set$.
