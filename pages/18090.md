This page is a detailed introduction to basic [[topology]].
Starting from scratch (required background is just a basic concept of _[[sets]]_), and amplifying motivation from [[analysis]],
it first develops standard [[point-set topology]] ([[topological spaces]]).
In passing, some basics of [[category theory]] make an informal appearance,
used to transparently summarize some conceptually important aspects of the theory, such as the [[reflective subcategory|reflection]] into
[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] and [[sober topological spaces]].
The second part introduces some basics of [[homotopy theory]], mostly the [[fundamental group]],
and ends with their first application to the classification of [[covering spaces]].

For introduction to genuine _[[homotopy theory]]_ see instead
at _[[Introduction to Homotopy Theory]]_.

The idea of _[[topology]]_ is to study "[[spaces]]" with "[[continuous functions]]" between them.
Specifically one considers [[functions]] between [[sets]] (whence "[[point-set topology]]", see [below](#PointSetTopology))
such that there is a concept for what it means that these functions depend
continuously on their arguments, in that that their values do not "jump".
Such a concept of [[continuous function|continuity]] is familiar from [[analysis]] on [[metric spaces]],
(recalled [below](#Continuity)) but the definition in topology generalizes this analytic concept
and renders it more foundational, generalizing the concept of [[metric spaces]] to that of _[[topological spaces]]_.
(def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} below).

Hence [[topology]] is the study of the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]], and whose
[[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] (see also remark \ref{TopCategory} below).
This category is much more flexible than that of [[metric spaces]], for example it admits the construction of
arbitrary [[quotients]] and [[intersections]] of spaces.
Accordingly, topology underlies or informs many and diverse areas of mathematics, such as
[[functional analysis]], [[operator algebra]], [[manifold]]/[[scheme]] theory, hence [[algebraic geometry]] and [[differential geometry]],
and the study of [[topological groups]], [[topological vector spaces]], [[local  rings]], etc.. Not the least, it gives rise to
the field of [[homotopy theory]], where one considers also continuous deformations of continuous functions themselves ("[[homotopies]]").
Topology itself has many branches,
such as _[[low-dimensional topology]]_ or _[[topological domain theory]]_.

A popular imagery for the concept of a [[continuous function]] is provided by deformations of [[elasticity|elastic]]
physical bodies, which may be deformed by stretching them without tearing. The canonical illustration is
a continous [[bijection|bijective]] function from the [[torus]] to the surface of a coffee mug, which maps half of the torus to the
handle of the coffee mug, and continuously deforms parts of the other half in order to form the actual cup.
Since the [[inverse function]] to this function is itself continuous,
the torus and the coffee mug, both regarded as [[topological spaces]], are "[[isomorphism|the same]]"
for the purposes of [[topology]], one says they are _[[homeomorphic]]_.

On the other hand, there is _no_ [[homeomorphism]] from the [[torus]] to, for instance, the [[sphere]], signifying that these
represent two topologically distinct spaces. Part of topology is concerned with studying [[homeomorphism]]-[[invariants]]
of topological spaces which allow to detect by means of [[algebra|algebraic]] manipulations
whether two topological spaces are homeomorphic
(or more generally [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]]). This is called _[[algebraic topology]]_.
A basic algebraic invariant is the [[fundamental group]] of a topological space (discussed [below](#FundamentalGroups)),
which measures how many ways there are to wind loops inside a topological space.

Beware that the popular imagery of "[[rubber-sheet geometry]]" only captures part of the full scope of topology,
in that it invokes spaces that _locally_ still look like [[metric spaces]].
But the concept of topological spaces is a good bit more general.
Notably [[finite topological spaces]] are either [[discrete topological space|discrete]] or very much unlike
[[metric spaces]] (example \ref{FiniteT1SpacesAreDiscrete} below), they play a role in [[categorical logic]]. Also in [[geometry]] exotic topological spaces frequently arise when  forming non-free [[quotients]].
In order to gauge just how many of such "exotic" examples of topological  spaces beyond locally [[metric spaces]] one wishes
to admit in the theory,
extra "[[separation axioms]]" are imposed on topological spaces (see [below](#SeparationAxioms)), and the flavour of topology as a field
depends on this choice.

Among the separation axioms, the _[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff space]]_ axiom is most popular
(see [below](#TnTopologicalSpaces)) the weaker axiom of [[sober topological space|soberity]] (see [below](#SoberSpaces)) stands out, on the one
hand because this is the weakest axiom that is still naturally satisfied in applications to [[algebraic geometry]] ([[schemes are sober]])
and [[computer science]] ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)) and on the other hand because it fully realizes the strong roots that
topology has in [[formal logic]]: [[sober topological spaces]] are entirely characterized by the
union-, intersection- and inclusion-relations
(logical [[conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[implication]]) among their [[open subsets]] ([[propositions]]).
This leads to a natural
and fruitful generalization of [[topology]] to more general "purely logic-determined spaces", called _[[locales]]_
and in yet more generality _[[toposes]]_ and _[[higher topos theory|higher toposes]]_. While the latter are beyond
the scope of this introduction, their rich theory and relation to the [[foundations]] of mathematics and geometry
provides an outlook on the relevance of the basic ideas of [[topology]].

## Point-set topology
 {#PointSetTopology}

In this first part we discuss the foundations of the concept of "sets equipped with topology"
([[topological spaces]]) and of [[continuous functions]] between them.


### Metric spaces
 {#Continuity}

The concept of continuity was made precise first in [[analysis]], in terms of [[epsilontic analysis]] of [[open balls]], recalled as def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} below. Then it was realized that this has a more elegant formulation in terms of the more general concept of _[[open sets]]_, this is prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets} below. Adopting the latter as the definition leads to a more abstract concept of "continuous space", this is the concept of _[[topological spaces]]_, def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} below.

Here we briefly recall the relevant basic concepts from [[analysis]], as a motivation for various definitions in
[[topology]]. The reader who either already recalls these concepts in analysis
or is content with ignoring the motivation of topology from analysis should skip right away to the section _[Topological spaces](#TopologicalSpaces)_.

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpace}
###### Definition
**(metric space)**

A _[[metric space]]_ is

1. a [[set]] $X$ (the "underlying set");

1. a [[function]] $d \;\colon\; X \times X \to [0,\infty)$ (the "distance function") from the [[Cartesian product]] of the set with itself to the [[nonnegative number|non-negative]] [[real numbers]]

such that for all $x,y,z \in X$:

1. (symmetry) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$

1. ([[triangle inequality]]) $d(x,y)+ d(y,z) \geq d(x,z)$.

1. (non-degeneracy) $d(x,y) = 0 \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\; x = y$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #OpenBalls}
###### Definition

Let $(X,d)$, be a [[metric space]]. Then for every element $x \in X$ and every  $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_+$ a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], we write

$$
  B^\circ_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) \lt \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the [[open ball]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$.

Similarly we write

$$
  B_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) \leq \epsilon
  \right\}
$$

for the _closed ball_ of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$. Finally w write

$$
  S_x(\epsilon)
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    y \in X \;\vert\; d(x,y) = \epsilom
  \right\}
$$

for the [[sphere]] of [[radius]] $\epsilon$ around $x$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}
###### Definition

For $(X,d)$ a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) then a [[subset]] $S \subset X$
is called a _[[bounded subset]]_ if $S$ is contained in some [[open ball]] (def. \ref{OpenBalls})

$$
  S \ubset B^\circ_x(r)
$$

around some $x \in X$ of some [[radius]] $r \in \mathbb{R}$.

A key source of metric spaces are [[norm|normed]] _[[vector spaces]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #NormedVectorSpace}
###### Dedfinition
**(normed vector space)**

A _[[normed vector space]]_ is

1. [[real vector space]] $V$;

1. a [[function]] (the _[[norm]]_)

   $$
     {\Vert {-} \Vert} \colon V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
   $$

   from the underlying [[set]] of $V$ to the [[real numbers]],

such that for all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $v , w \in V$ it holds true that

1. (linearity) ${\Vert c v \Vert} = c {\Vert v \Vert }$;

1. ([[triangle inequality]]) ${\Vert v+w \Vert} \leq {\Vert v \Vert } + {\Vert w \Vert}$;

1. (non-degeneracy) if ${\Vert v \Vert} = 0$ then $v = 0$.

=--



+-- {: .num_prop #MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace}
###### Proposition

Every [[normed vector space]] $(V, {\Vert {-} \Vert})$
becomes a [[metric space]] according to def. \ref{MetricSpace} by setting

$$
  d(x,y) \coloneqq {\Vert x-y \Vert}
  \,.
$$

=--

Examples of [[normed vector spaces]] (def. \ref{NormedVectorSpace}) and hence, via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace},
of [[metric spaces]] include the following:

+-- {: .num_example #EuclideanNorm}
###### Example

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[Cartesian space]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n
    =
   \left\{
     \vec x
     =
     (x_i)_{i = 1}^n
     \vert
      x_i \in \mathbb{R}
   \right\}
$$

carries a [[norm]] (the _Euclidean norm_ ) given by the [[square root]] of the [[sum]] of the [[squares]] of the components:

   $$
     {\Vert \vec x \Vert}
       \;\coloneqq\;
     \sqrt{
     \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
       (x_i)^2
     }
     \,.
   $$

Via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace} this gives $\mathbb{R}^n$ the structure of a
[[metric space]], and as such it is called the _[[Euclidean space]]_ of [[dimension]] $n$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #pNorm}
###### Example

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">

</div>

More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $p \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \geq 1$, then the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ carries the _[[p-norm]]_

   $$
     {\Vert \vec x \Vert}_p  \coloneqq \root p {\sum_i {|x_i|^p}}
   $$

The graphics on the right (grabbed from Wikipedia) shows unit circles (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to various [[p-norms]].

By the [[Minkowski inequality]],
the [[p-norm]] generalizes to non-[[finite dimensional vector spaces]] such as [[sequence spaces]] and [[Lebesgue spaces]].

#### Continuity
 {#ContinuityInAnalysis}

The following now is the fairly obvious definition of continuity for functions between metric spaces.

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/EpsilonDeltaBalls.png" width="250">
</div>

For $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ two [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), then a [[function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is said to be _continuous at a point $x \in X$_ if for every $\epsilon \gt 0$ there exists $\delta\gt 0$ such that

$$
  d_X(x,y) \lt \delta \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; d_Y(f(x), f(y)) \lt \epsilon
$$

or equivalently such that

$$
  f(\;B_x^\circ(\delta)\;) \;\subset\; B^\circ_{f(x)}(\epsilon)
$$

where $B^\circ$ denotes the [[open ball]] (definition \ref{OpenBalls}).

The function $f$ is said to be _continuous_ if it is continuous at every point $x \in X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Consider the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded as the
1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}$ from example \ref{EuclideanNorm}.

For $P \in \mathbb{R}[X]$ a [[polynomial]], then the function

$$
  \array{
    f_P &\colon& \mathbb{R} &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& P(x)
  }
$$

is a [[continuous function]] in the sense of def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity}.

On the other hand, a [[step function]] is continuous everywhere except at the [[finite number]] of points
at which it changes its value.



=--

We now reformulate the analytic concept of continuity from def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} in terms of the simple but important concept of _[[open sets]]_:


+-- {: .num_defn #OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}
###### Definition
**(neighbourhood and open set)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}). Say that

1. A _[[neighbourhood]]_ of a point $x \in X$ is a [[subset]] $x \in U \subset X$ which contains some [[open ball]] $B_x^\circ(\epsilon)$ around $x$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}).

1. An _[[open subset]]_ of $X$ is a [[subset]] $U \subset X$ such that for every $x \in U$ it also contains a [[neighbourhood]] of $x$.

=--


The following picture shows a point $x$, some [[open balls]] $B_i$ containing it, and two of its [[neighbourhoods]] $U_i$:

> graphics grabbed from [Munkres 75](#Munkres75)

+-- {: .num_example #OpenAndClosedIntervals}
###### Example

Regard the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

For $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the following [[subsets]]:

1. $(a,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x \lt b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (open interval)

1. $(a,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x \leq b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (half-open interval)

1. $[a,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x \lt b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (half-open interval)

1. $[a,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x \leq b \right\}$ $\phantom{AA}$ (closed interval)

The first of these is an open subset according to def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}, the other three are not.
The first one is called an _[[open interval]]_, the last one a _[[closed interval]]_
and the middle two are called _[[half-open intervals]]_.

Similarly for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ one considers

1. $(-\infty,b) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert x \lt b  \right\}$

1. $(a,\infty) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \lt x  \right\}$

1. $(-\infty,b] \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert x \leq b  \right\}$

1. $[a,\infty) \coloneqq \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \vert a \leq x  \right\}$

The first two of these are open subsets, the last two are not.

=--

We may now reprase the analytic definition of continuity entirely in terms of open subsets (def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}).

+-- {: .num_prop #ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets}
###### Proposition
**(rephrasing continuity in terms of open sets)**

A [[function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ between [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) is [[continuous function|continuous]] in the [[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] sense of def. \ref{EpsilonDeltaDefinitionOfContinuity} precisely if it has the property that its [[pre-images]] of [[open subsets]] of $Y$ (in the sense of def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace}) are open subsets of $X$.

=--

+-- {: principle}
**principle of continuity**

$\,$ $\,$ _Pre-Images of open subsets are open._

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First assume that $f$ is continuous in the epsilontic sense. Then for $O_Y \subset Y$ any [[open subset]] and $x \in f^{-1}(O_Y)$ any point in the pre-image, we need to show that there exists a [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ in $f^{-1}(O_Y)$. But by assumption there exists an [[open ball]] $B_x^\circ(\epsilon)$ with $f(B_x^\circ(\epsilon)) \subset O_Y$. Since this is true for all $x$, by definition this means that $f^{-1}(O_Y)$ is open in $X$.

Conversely, assume that $f^{-1}$ takes open subsets to open subsets. Then for every $x \in X$ and $B_{f(x)}^\circ(\epsilon)$ an [[open ball]] around its image, we need to produce an open ball $B_x^\circ(\delta)$ in its pre-image. But by assumption $f^{-1}(B_{f(x)}^\circ(\epsilon))$ contains a [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ which by definition means that it contains such an open ball around $x$.

Consider then for $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$ the [[open interval]] $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$,
an [[open subset]] according to example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}.
The [[preimage]] of this open subset is

$$

  (a,b)

By example \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}, the last of these preimages listed is not an open subset.

#### Convergence

Recall the concept of [[convergence]] of [[sequences]] in [[metric spaces]] via [[epsilontic analysis]]:

from the [[natural numbers]] to $X$.

A [[normed vector space]], regarded as a metric space via prop. \ref{MetricSpaceFromNormedVectorSpace} that
is complete in this sense is called a _[[Banach space]]_.

if every [[sequence]] in $X$ has a subsequence (def. \ref{Sequences}) which [[convergence|converges]] (def. \ref{Convergence}).

=--

The key fact to translate this [[epsilontic analysis|epsilontic]] definition of compactness to a concept that
makes sense for general [[topological space]] ([below](#CompactSpaces)) is the following:

+-- {: .num_prop #CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
###### Proposition

For a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ (def. \ref{MetricSpace}) the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is [[sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]];

1. for every [[set]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of [[open subsets]] $U_i$ of $X$ (def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace})
   which cover $X$ in that $X = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i$, then
   there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ of these open subsets which still covers
   $X$ in that also $X = \underset{i \in J \subset I}{\cup} U_i = X$.

=--

For a proof see at _[[sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]]_.
This proof is most conveniently formulated some of the terminology of topology which we introduce in the following.






### Topological spaces
 {#TopologicalSpaces}

Due to prop. \ref{ContinuityBetweenMetricSpacesInTermsOfOpenSets}
we should pay attention to [[open subsets]] in [[metric spaces]]. It turns out that the following closure
property is what _characterizes_ the concept:

+-- {: .num_prop #OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties}
###### Proposition
**(closure properties of open sets in a metric space)**

The collection of [[open subsets]] of a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ as in def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} has the following properties:

1. The [[intersection]] of any [[finite number]] of open subsets is again an open subset.

1. The [[union]] of any [[set]] of open subsets is again an open subset.

In particular

Proposition \ref{OpenSubsetsOfMetricSpaceClosureProperties} motivates
the following generalized definition, which abstracts away from the concept of [[metric space]]
just its system of [[open subsets]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSpace}
###### Definition
**(topological spaces)**

Given a [[set]] $X$, then a _topology_ on $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of [[subsets]] of $X$ called the _[[open subsets]]_, hence a [[subset]] of the [[power set]]

$$
  \tau \subset P(X)
$$

such that this is closed under forming

1. finite [[intersections]];

1. arbitrary [[unions]].

A set $X$ equipped with such a [[topology]] is called a _[[topological space]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the field of [[topology]] it is common to eventually simply say "[[space]]" as shorthand for "[[topological space]]".
This is especially so as further qualifiers are added, such as "Hausdorff  space" (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace} below).
But beware that there are other kinds of [[spaces]] in mathematics.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The simple definition of [[open subsets]] in def. \ref{TopologicalSpace} and the simple
implementation of the _principle of continuity_ below in def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}
gives the field of [[topology]] its fundamental and universal flavor. The combinatorial nature of these definitions makes
topology be closely related to [[formal logic]]. This becomes more manifest still for the "[[sober topological space]]"
discussed [below](#SoberSpaces). For more on this perspective see also at _[[locale]]_.
An introductory textbook amplifying this perspective is ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)).

=--

Here is some common **further terminology** relating to topological spaces:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologyFinerCoarser}
###### Definition
**(finer/coarser topologies)**

Let $X$ be a [[set]], and let $\tau_1, \tau_2 \in P(X)$ be two [[topological space|topologies]] on $X$,
hence two choices of [[open subsets]] for $X$, making it a [[topological space]]. If

$$
  \tau_1 \subset \tau_2
$$

hence if every open subset of $X$ with respect to $\tau_1$ is also regarded as open by $\tau_2$, then
one says that

* the topology $\tau_2$ is _[[finer topology|finer]]_ than the topology $\tau_2$

* the topology $\tau_1$ is _[[coarser topology|coarser]]_ than the topology $\tau_1$.

#### Examples
 {#TopologicalSpacesExamples}

We discuss some basic examples of [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}).

Our motivating example now reads as follows:

+-- {: .num_example #MetricTopology}
###### Example
**(metric topology)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}). Then the collection of its [[open subsets]] in def. \ref{OpenSubsetsOfAMetricSpace} constitutes a _[[topological space|topology]]_ on the set $X$, making it a _[[topological space]]_ in the sense of def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}. This is called the _[[metric topology]]_.

=--

Stated more concisely: the [[open balls]] in a metric space constitute a "[[basis of a topology|basis]]" for the [[metric topology]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologyBase}
###### Definition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], def. \ref{TopologicalSpace},
and let

$$
  B \subset \tau
$$

be a [[subset]] of its set of [[open subsets]]. We say that

1. $B$ is a _[[topological base|basis for the topology]]_ if every open subset $O \in \tau$ is a [[union]] of elements of $B$;

1. $B$ is a _[[topological base|sub-basis for the topology]]_ if every open subset $O \in \tau $ is a [[union]] of [[finitary intersections]] of elements of $B$.

=--

Often it is convenient to define topologies by defining some (sub-)basis. An example is the definition of the
[[compact-open topology]] on [[mapping spaces]] below in def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology}.

While the example of [[metric space]] topologies (example \ref{MetricTopology}) is the motivating example
for the concept of [[topological spaces]], it is important to notice that the concept
of topological spaces is considerably more general, as some of the following examples show.


The following simple example of a (metric) topological space is important for the theory:

+-- {: .num_example #Point}
###### Example

On a [[singleton]] set $\{1\}$ there exists a unique topology $\tau$
making it a [[topological space]] according to def. \ref{TopologicalSpace},
namely

$$
  \tau
    \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \emptyset , \{1\}
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Of course this is equivalently the [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}) on $\mathbb{R}^0$,
regarded as the 0-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

We write

$$
  \ast \coloneqq (\{1\}, \left\{ \emptyset, \{1\}\right\})
$$

for this topological space and call it _the [[point]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #SierpinskiSpace}
###### Example

On the 2-element set $\{0,1\}$ there are (up to [[permutation]] of elements) three distinct topologies:

1. the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) $\tau = \left\{   \emptyset, \{0,1\}  \right\}$;

1. the _[[discrete topology]]_ (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}), $\tau = \left\{   \emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}  \right\}$;

1. the _[[Sierpinski space]]_ topology $\tau = \left\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\}  \right\}$.

+-- {: .num_example #CoDiscreteTopology}
###### Example
**(discrete and co-discrete topology)**

Let $S$ be any [[set]]. Then there are always the following two extreme
possibilities of equipping $X$ with a topology $\tau \subset P(X)$ in the sense of
def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}, and hence making it a [[topological space]]:

1. $\tau \coloneqq P(S)$ the set of _all_ open subsets;

   this is called the _[[discrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[finer topology|finest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$,

   we write $Disc(S)$ for the resulting topological space;

1. $\tau \coloneqq \{ \emptyset, S \}$ the set contaning only the [[empty set|empty]] subset of $S$ and all of $S$ itself;

   this is called the _[[codiscrete topology]]_ on $S$, it is the [[coarser topology|coarsest topology]] (def. \ref{TopologyFinerCoarser}) on $X$

   we write $CoDisc(S)$ for the resulting topological space.

The reason for this terminology is best seen when considering [[continuous functions]] into these (co-)disctete topological spaces.
See example \ref{ContinuousFunctionsIntoCoDiscreteTopologicalSpaces} below.

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologyCofinite}
###### Definition

Given a [[set]] $X$, then the _[[cofinite topology]]_ or _finite complement topology_ on $X$ is the [[topological space|topology]]
(def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) whose [[open subsets]] are precisely

1. all [[cofinite subsets]];

1. the [[empty set]].

If $X$ is a [[finite set]] (but not otherwise) then the cofinite topology on $X$ coincides with the [[discrete topological space|discrete topology]] on $X$ (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}).

+-- {: .num_defn #DisjointUnionOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

For $\{(X_i, \tau_i)\}_{i \in I}$ a [[set]] of topological spaces, then their _[[disjoint union]]_

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} (X_i, \tau_i)
$$

is the topological space whose underlying set is the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying sets of the summand spaces,
and whose open subsets are precisely the disjoint unions of the open subsets of the summand spaces.

In particular, for $I$ any index set, then the disjoint union

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} \ast
$$

of $I$ copies of the [[point]] (example \ref{Point}) is equivalently the [[discrete topological space]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology})
on that index set.

For $(X_1,\tau_1)$ and $(X_2, \tau_2)$ two [[topological spaces]], then their _[[product topological space]]_
has as underlying set the [[Cartesian product]] $X_1 \times X_2$ of the corresponding two underlying sets,
and its topology is generated from the [[basis for a topology|basis]] (def. \ref{TopologyBase})
given by the Cartesian products $U_1 \times U_2$ of the opens $U_i \in \tau_i$.

These constructions of [[discrete topological spaces]], [[quotient topological spaces]], [[topological subspaces]] and of [[product topological spaces]] are simple examples of **[[limits]]** and of **[[colimits]]** of topological spaces.

#### Closed subsets
 {#ClosedSubsets}

The [[complements]] of [[open subsets]] in a [[topological space]] are called _[[closed subsets]]_
(def. \ref{ClosedSubset} below).
This simple definition indeed captures the concept of closure in the [[analysis|analytic]]
sense of [[convergence]] of [[sequences]] (prop. \ref{ConvergenceInClosedSubspace} below). Of particular interest for the theory of topological spaces in the discussion of [[separation axioms]] [below](#SeparationAxioms) are those closed subsets which are
"[[irreducible closed subset|irreducible]]" (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible} below). These happen to be equivalently the
"[[frame]] homomorphisms" (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}) to the [[frame of opens]] of the point
(prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} below).

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}). Then
a [[subset]] $S$ of $X$ is called a _[[closed subset]]_ if its [[complement]] $X \backslash S$ is an  _[[open subset]]_:

+-- {: .num_prop #ConvergenceInClosedSubspace}
###### Proposition
**(convergence in closed subspaces)**

Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), regarded as a [[topological space]] via example \ref{MetricTopology},
and let $V \subset X$ be a [[subset]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $V \subset X$ is a [[closed subspace]] according to def. \ref{ClosedSubset}.

1. For every [[sequence]] $x_i \in V \subset X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}) with elements in $V$, which [[convergence|converges]]
   as a sequence in $X$ (def. \ref{Convergence}) it also converges in $V$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First assume that $V \subset X$ is closed and that $x_i \overset{i \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_{\infty}$ for some
$x_\infty \in X$. We need to show that then $x_\infty \in V$. Suppose it were not, then
$x_\infty \in X\backslash V$. Since by definition this [[complement]] $X \backslash V$ is an [[open subset]],
it follows that there exists a [[real number]] $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that the [[open ball]]
around $x$ of radius $\epsilon$ is still contained in the complement: $B^\circ_x(\epsilon) \subset X \backslash V$.
But since the sequence is assumed to converge in $X$, this means that there exists $N_\epsilon$ such that all
$x_{i \gt N_{\epsilon}}$ are in $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$, hence in $X\backslash V$. This contradicts the assumption that
all $x_i$ are in $V$, and hence we have [[proof by contradiction|proved by contradiction]] that $x_\infty \in V$.

Conversely, assume that for all sequences in $V$ that converge to some $x_\infty \in X$ then $x_\infty \in V \subset W$.
We need to show that then $V$ is closed, hence that $X \backslash V \subset X$ is an open subset, hence that for every
$x \in X \backslash V$ we may find a real number $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that the [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ around $x$
of radius $\epsilon$ is still contained in
$X \backslash V$. Suppose on the contrary that such $\epsilon$ did not exist. This would mean that for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$
with $k \geq 1$ then the [[intersection]] $B^\circ_x(1/k) \cap V$ is [[inhabited|non-empty]]. Hence then we could choose
points $x_k \in B^\circ_x(1/k) \cap V$ in these intersections. These would form a sequence which clearly converges to
the original $x$, and so by assumption we would conclude that $x \in V$, which violates the assumption that $x \in X \backslash V$.
Hence we [[proof by contradiction|proved by contradiction]] $X \backslash V$ is in fact open.

A special role in the theory is played by the "irreducible" closed subspaces:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClosedIrreducible}
###### Definition
**([[irreducible closed subspace]])**

A [[closed subset]] $S \subset X$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) of a [[topological space]] $X$ is called _[[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]]_ if it is
[[inhabited|non-empty]] and not the [[union]] of two closed proper (i.e. smaller) subsets. In other words, $S$ is irreducible if whenever
$S_1, S_2 \subset X$ are two [[closed subspace]] such that

$$
  S = S_1 \cup S_2
$$

then $S_1 = S$ or $S_2 = S$.

+-- {: .num_example #IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}
###### Example

For $x \in X$ a [[point]] inside a [[topological space]], then
the [[topological closure|closure]] $Cl(\{x\})$ of the [[singleton]] [[subset]] $\{x\} \subset X$
is [[irreducible closed subset|irrducible]] (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible}).

=--

Sometimes it is useful to re-express the condition of irreducibility of closed subspace
in terms of complementary open subsets:

+-- {: .num_prop #OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}
###### Proposition
**(irreducible closed subsets in terms of prime open subsets)**

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $P \in \tau \subset P(X)$ be a proper [[open subset]],
so that the [[complement]] $F \coloneqq X\backslash P$ is an [[inhabited]] [[closed subspace]]. Then $F$
is [[irreducible closed subspace|irreducible]] in the sense of def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible} precisely if whenever $U_1,U_2 \in \tau$ are open subsets
with $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ then $U_1 \subset P$ or $U_2 \subset P$:

$$
  \left(
    X \backslash P \,\text{irreducible}
  \right)
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{U_1, U_2 \in \tau}{\forall }
    \left(
      \left(
        U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P
      \right)
      \;\Rightarrow\;
      \left(U_1 \subset P \;\text{or}\; U_2 \subset P\right)
    \right)
  \right)
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Every [[closed subset]] $F_i \subset F$ may be exhibited as the [[complement]]

$$
  F_i = F \backslash U_i
$$

for some open subset $U_i \in \tau$. Observe that under this identification the condition
that $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_1 \cup F_2 = F$,
because it is equivalent to the equation labeled $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  F_1 \cup F_2
  & =
  (F \backslash U_1) \cup (F \backslash U_2)
  \\
  &
  = \left( X \backslash (P \cup U_1) \right) \cup \left( X \backslash P \cup U_2 \right)
  \\
  & = X \backslash ( P \cup (U_1 \cap U_2)  )
  \\
  & \stackrel{(\star)}{=}   X \backslash P
  \\
  & = F
\end{aligned}
\,.
$$

Similarly, the condition that $U_i \subset P$ is equivalent to the condition that $F_i = F$,
because it is quivalent to the equality $(\star)$ in the following sequence of equalities:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F_i &= F \backslash U_i
    \\
    & = X \backslash ( P \cup U_i )
    \\
    & \stackrel{(\star)}{=} X \backslash P
    \\
    & =
    F
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Under these equivalences, the two conditions are manifestly the same.

=--

We will consider yet another equivalent characterization of irreducible closed subsets.
Stating this requires the following concept of "[[frame]]" [[homomorphism]],
the natural kind of [[homomorphisms]] between [[topological spaces]] if we were to forget the
underlying set of points of a topological space, and only remember the set $\tau_X$ with its
finite intersections and arbitrary unions:

(where the first equality holds because $\phi$ preserves finite intersections by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}, the inclusion holds because $\phi$ respects
inclusions by remark \ref{PreservationOfInclusionsByFrameHomomorphism}, and the second equality holds because $\phi$ preserves arbitrary unions
by def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}).
But in $\tau_\ast = \{\emptyset, \{1\}\}$ the intersection of two open subsets is empty precisely if at least one of them is empty,
hence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$ or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$. But this means that $U_1 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ or $U_2 \subset U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$, as claimed.

Now according to prop. \ref{OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible}
the condition $(\ast)$ identifies the [[complement]]
$X \backslash U_{\emptyset}(\phi)$ as an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(X,\tau)$.

Conversely, given an irreducible closed subset $X \backslash U_0$, define $\phi$ by

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  U
    \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{if} \, U \subset U_0
      \\
      \{1\} & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This does preserve

1. arbitrary unions

   because $\phi(\underset{i}{\cup} U_i) = \{0\}$ precisely if $\underset{i}{\cup}U_i \subset U_0$ which is the
   case precisely if all $U_i \subset U_0$, which means that all $\phi(U_i) = \emptyset$ and $\underset{i}{\cup}\emptyset = \emptyset$;

   while $\phi(\underset{i}{\cup}U_1) = \{1\}$ as soon as one of the $U_i$ is not contained in $U_0$, which means that
   one of the $\phi(U_i) = \{1\}$ which means that $\underset{i}{\cup} \phi(U_i) = \{1\}$;

1. finite intersections,

   because if $U_1 \cap U_2 \in U_0$, then by $(\ast)$ $U_1 \in U_0$ or $U_2 \in U_0$, whence $\phi(U_1) = \emptyset$
   or $\phi(U_2) = \emptyset$, whence with $\phi(U_1 \cap U_2) = \emptyset$ also $\phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2) = \emptyset$;

   while if $U_1 \cap U_2$ is not contained in $U_0$ then neither $U_1$ nor $U_2$ is contained in $U_0$ and hence with
   $\phi(U_1 \cap U_2) = \{1\}$ also $\phi(U_1) \cap \phi(U_2) = \{1\} \cap \{1\} = \{1\}$.

Hence this is indeed a frame homomorphism $\tau_X \to \tau_\ast$.

Clearly these two operations are inverse to each other.

###### Definition
**(continuous function)**

A _[[continuous function]]_ between [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace})

$$
  f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

is a [[function]] between the underlying sets,

$$
  f \colon X \longrightarrow Y
$$

such that [[pre-images]] under $f$ of open subsets of $Y$ are open subsets of $X$.

=--

We may equivalently state this in terms of [[closed subsets]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #ClosedSubsetContinuity}
###### Proposition

Let $(X_1, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be two [[topological spaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}).
Then a [[function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

between the underlying [[sets]] is [[continuous function|continuous]] in the sense of def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}
precisely if [[pre-images]] under $f$ of [[closed subsets]] of $Y$ (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) are
closed subsets of $X$.

**(the category of topological spaces)**

For $X_1, X_2, X_3$ three [[topological spaces]] and for

$$
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_2 \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} X_3
$$

two [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) then their [[composition]]

$$

  \;\colon\;
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2 \overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow} X_3
$$

is clearly itself again a continuous function from $X_1$ to $X_3$.
Moreover, this composition operation is clearly _[[associativity|associative]]_, in that for

$$
  X_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} X_2
  \phantom{AA}\text{and}\phantom{AA}
  X_2 \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} X_3

   =
  (f_3 \circ f_2) \circ f_1
  \;\colon\;
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_3
  \,.
$$

Finally, the composition operation is also clearly _[[unitality|unital]]_, in that for
each topological space $X$ there exists the [[identity]] function $id_X \colon X \to X$
and for $f \colon X_1 \to X_2$ any continuous function then

$$
  id_{X_2} \circ f  \;=\; f \;=\; f \circ id_{X_1}
  \,.
$$


One summarizes this situation by saying that:

1. [[topological spaces]] constitute the _[[objects]]_

1. [[continuous functions]] constitute the _[[morphisms]]_ ([[homomorphisms]])

there is a unique continuous function

$$
  \ast \longrightarrow X
$$

from the [[point]] (def. \ref{Point}), whose image in $X$ is that element. Hence there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$

between the continuous functions from the point to any topological space, and the underlying set of that topological space.

+-- {: .num_defn #FunctionLocallyConstant}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) is called
_[[locally constant function|locally constant]]_ if every point $x \in X$ has a [[neighbourhood]]
on which the function is constant.

1. the [[discrete topological space]] $Disc(S)$;

1. the [[co-discrete topological space]] $CoDisc(S)$

on the underlying set $S$. Then [[continuous functions]] (def. \ref{ContinuousMaps}) into these satisfy:

1. every [[continuous function]] $(X,\tau) \longrightarrow Disc(S)$ is [[locally constant function|locally constant]] (def. \ref{FunctionLocallyConstant});

1. every [[function]] (of sets) $X \longrightarrow CoDisc(S)$ is [[continuous function|continuous]].

###### Example

For $X$ a [[set]], its _[[diagonal]]_ $\Delta_X$ is the [[function]]

  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
     \\
     x &\mapsto& (x,x)

$$

For $(X,\tau)$ a [[topological space]], then the diagonal is a [[continuous function]]
to the [[product topological space]] (def. \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) of $X$ with itself.

$$
  \Delta_X \;\colon\; (X, \tau) \longrightarrow (X \times X, \tau_{X \times X})
  \,.
$$

To see this, it is sufficient to see that the [[preimages]] of [[basis for a topology|basic opens]] $U_1 \times U_2$
in $\tau_{X \times X}$ are in $\tau_X$.But these pre-images are the [[intersections]] $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset X$,
which are open by the axioms on the topology $\tau_X$.

#### Homeomorphisms
 {#Homeomorphisms}


With the [[objects]] ([[topological spaces]]) and the [[morphisms]] ([[continuous functions]]) of the [[category]] [[Top]] thus defined
(remark \ref{TopCategory}), we obtain the concept of "sameness" in topology. To make this precise, one says that a [[morphism]]

$$
  X \overset{f}{\to} Y
$$

in a [[category]] is an _[[isomorphism]]_ if there exists a morphism going the other way around

$$
  X \overset{g}{\longleftarrow} Y
$$

which is an [[inverse]] in the sense that

$$
  f \circ g = id_Y \;\;\;\;\; and \;\;\;\;\; g \circ f = id_X
  \,.
$$

Since such $g$ is unique if it exsist, one often writes "$f^{-1}$" for this [[inverse morphism]]. However, in the context
of [[topology]] then $f^{-1}$ usually refers to the [[pre-image]] function of a given [[function]] $f$, and in these
notes we will stick to this usage.

+-- {: .num_defn #Homeomorphism}
###### Definition
**(homeomorphisms)**

An [[isomorphism]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] with [[continuous functions]] between them is called a _[[homeomorphism]]_.

Hence a _[[homeomorphism]]_ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  f \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

such that there exists a [[continuous function]] the other way around

$$
  (X, \tau_X) \longleftarrow (Y, \tau_Y) \;\colon\; g
$$

such that their [[composition|composites]] are the [[identity functions]] on $X$ and $Y$,
respectively:

$$
  f \circ g = id_{Y} \;\;\;and\;\;\; g \circ f = id_{X}
  \,.

###### Remark

If $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) with inverse contiinuous function $g$, then
of course also $g$ is a homeomophism, with inverse continuous function $f$.

The underlying function of sets $f \colon X \to Y$ of a homeomorphism $f$ is necessarily a [[bijection]].
But beware that not every [[continuous function]] which is [[bijection|bijective]] on underlying sets
is a homeomorphism. While an inverse $g$ will exists on the level of functions of sets, this inverse may fail
to be continuous, see example \ref{ExponentialMapFromHalfOpenIntervalToCircle} below.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ExponentialMapFromHalfOpenIntervalToCircle}
###### Example

Consider the [[continuous function]]

$$
  \array{
    [0,2\pi) &\longrightarrow& S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2
    \\
    t &\mapsto& (cos(t), sin(t))
  }
$$

from the [[half-open interval]] (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) to the unit circle $S^1 \coloneqq S_0(1) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}), regarded as a [[topological subspace]] (def. \ref{SubspaceTopology})
of the [[Euclidean plane]] (def. \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

The underlying function of sets of $f$ is a [[bijection]]. The [[inverse function]] of sets however fails to be continuous
at $(1,0) \in S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Hence this $f$ is _not_ a [[homeomorphism]].

Indeed, below we see that the two topological spaces $[0,2\pi)$ and $S^1$ are distinguished by
topological invariants and hence not homeomorphic. For example $S^1$ is a [[compact topological space]]
(def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace})
while $[0,2\pi)$ is not, and $S^1$ has a non-trivial [[fundamental group]], while that of $[0,2\pi)$
is trivial (def. \ref{FundamentalGroup}).

###### Example
**(open interval homeomorphic to the real line)**

Regard the [[real line]] as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (example \ref{EuclideanNorm}).

The open [[interval]] $(-1,1)$ (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) is [[homeomorphic]] to all of the [[real line]]

$$
  (0,1) \underset{homeo}{\simeq} \mathbb{R}^1
  \,.
$$

An [[inverse]] pair of [[continuous functions]] is for instance given by

$$
  \array{
    f &\colon&  \mathbb{R}^1 &\longrightarrow& (-1,+1)
    \\
    && x &\mapsto& \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+ x^2}}
  }

and

$$

    \\
    && x &\mapsto& \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
  }

Generally, every [[open ball]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (def. \ref{OpenBalls}) is [[homeomorphic]] to all of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #HomeomorphismBetweenTopologicalAndCombinatorialCircle}
###### Example
**(interval glued at endpoints is homeomorphic to the circle)**

As topological spaces, the [[closed interval]] $[0,1]$ (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) with its two endpoints identified is [[homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}) to the standard [[circle]]:

$$
  [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)} \;\; \underset{homeo}{\simeq} \;\; S^1
  \,.
$$

More in detail: let

$$
  S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2
$$

be the unit [[circle]] in the [[plane]]

$$
  S^1 = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2, x^2 + y^2 = 1\}
$$

equipped with the [[subspace topology]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$,
which itself equipped with its standard [[metric topology]] (example \ref{MetricTopology}).

Moreover, let

$$
  [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}
$$

be the [[quotient topological space]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}) obtained from the [[interval]] $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}^1$ with its [[subspace topology]] by applying the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies the two endpoints (and nothing else).

Consider then the function

$$
  f \;\colon\; [0,1] \longrightarrow S^1
$$

given by

$$
  t \mapsto (cos(t), sin(t))
  \,.
$$

This has the property that $f(0) = f(1)$, so that it descends to the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  \array{
    [0,1] &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& [0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
    \\
    && S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

We claim that $\tilde f$ is a [[homeomorphism]] (definition \ref{Homeomorphism}).

First of all it is immediate that $\tilde f$ is a [[continuous function]]. This follows immediately from the fact that $f$ is a [[continuous function]] and by definition of the [[quotient topology]] (example \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace}).

So we need to check that $\tilde f$ has a continuous inverse function. Clearly the restriction of $f$ itself to the open interval $(0,1)$ has a continuous inverse. It fails to have a continuous inverse on $[0,1)$ and on $(0,1]$ and fails to have an inverse at all on [0,1], due to the fact that $f(0) = f(1)$. But the relation quotiented out in $[0,1]_{/(0 \sim 1)}$ is exactly such as to fix this failure.

Similarly:

The [[square]] $[0,1]^2$ with two of its sides identified is the [[cylinder]], and with also the other two sides

###### Theorem
**([[topological invariance of dimension]])**

For $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ but $n_1 \neq n_2$, then the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ are _not_ [[homeomorphic]].

More generally, an [[open set]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ is never homeomorphic to an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ if $n_1 \neq n_2$.

=--

The proof of theorem \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension} is surprisingly hard, given how obvious the statement seems intuitively. It requires tools from a field called _[[algebraic topology]]_ (notably [[Brouwer's fixed point theorem]]).

We showcase some basic tools of [[algebraic topology]] now and demonstrate the nature of their usage by proving two very simple special cases of the [[topological invariance of dimension]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimensionFirstSimpleCase} and prop. \ref{topologicalInvarianceOfDimensionSecondSimpleCase} below).

###### Example
**(homeomorphism classes of surfaces)**

Generally the [[homeomorphism]] class of a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[orientable]] [[surface]] is determined by the number of "holes" it has, its _[[genus of a surface|genus]]_.

### Separation axioms
 {#SeparationAxioms}

The plain definition of _[[topological space]]_ happens to allow examples where distinct points or distinct subsets of the underlying set of a topological space appear as as more-or-less unseparable as seen by the topology on that set. In many applications one wants to exclude at least some of such degenerate examples from the discussion. The relevant conditions to be imposed on top of the plain [[axioms]] of a [[topological space]] are hence known as _[[separation axioms]]_.

These axioms are all of the form of saying that two subsets (of certain forms) in the topological space are 'separated' from each other in one sense if they are 'separated' in a (generally) weaker sense. For example the weakest axiom (called $T_0$) demands that if two points are distinct as elements of the underlying set of points, then there exists at least one [[open subset]] that contains one but not the other.

In this fashion one may impose a hierarchy of stronger axioms. For example demanding that given two distinct points, then each of them is contained in some open subset not containing the other ($T_1$) or that such a pair of open subsets around two distinct points may in addition be chosen to be disjoint ($T_2$). This last condition, $T_2$, also called the _[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff condition]]_ is the most common among all separation axioms. Often in [[topology]], this axiom is considered by default.

However, there are respectable areas of mathematics that involve topological spaces where the Hausdorff axiom fails, but
a weaker axiom is still satisfied, called [[sober topological spaces|soberity]].
This is the case notably in [[algebraic geometry]] ([[schemes are sober]]) and in [[computer science]] ([Vickers 89](#Vickers89)).
These [[sober topological spaces]] are singled out by the fact that they are entirely characterized by their
[[partially ordered sets]] [[frame of opens|of open subsets]] and may hence be understood independently from their
underlying sets of points.

| [[separation axioms]]                 |
|---------------------------------------|
| $\array{\\ &&& T_2 = \text{Hausdorff}  \\ && \swArrow && \seArrow \\ \, & T_1 && && \text{sober} & \, \\ && \seArrow && \swArrow \\ &&& T_0 = \text{Kolmogorov} \\ }  $ |

All separation axioms are satisfied by [[metric spaces]] (def. \ref{MetricSpace}), from whom the concept of topological space was originally abstracted [above](#TopologicalSpaces). Hence imposing some of them may also be understood as gauging just how far one allows topological spaces to generalize away from metric spaces




#### Hausdorff spaces
 {#TnTopologicalSpaces}


+-- {: .num_defn #HausdorffTopologicalSpace}
###### Definition

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}).


For $x \neq y \in X$ any two points in the underlying set of $X$ which are not [[equality|equal]] as elements of this set,
consider the following [[propositions]]:

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">

* **(T0)** _There exists a [[neighbourhood]] of one of the two points which does not contain the other point._

* **(T1)** _There exist [[neighbourhoods]] of both points which do not contain the other point._

* **(T2)** _There exists [[neighbourhoods]]_ of both points which do not intersect each other._

> graphics grabbed from [Vickers 89](#Vickers89)

The topological space $X$ is called a _$T_n$-topological space_ or just _$T_n$-space_, for short,
if it satisfies condition $T_n$ above for all pairs of distinct points.
A $T_2$-topological space is also called a _[[Hausdorff topological space]]_.


Notice that these propositions evidently imply each other as

$$
  T2 \Rightarrow T1 \Rightarrow T0
  \,.
$$

For definiteness, we re-state these conditions formally. Write $x,y \in X$ for points in $X$, write $U_x, U_y \in \tau$ for open [[neighbourhoods]] of these points. Then:

* **(T0**) $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left(
    \left( \underset{U_y}{\exists} \left( \{x\} \cap U_y = \emptyset \right) \right) \vee \left( \underset{U_x}{\exists} \left( U_x \cap \{y\} = \emptyset  \right) \right) \right)$

* **((T1)** $\underset{x \neq y}{\forall} \left(\underset{U_x,U_y}{\exists} \left(\left( \{x\} \cap U_y = \emptyset\right) \,\wedge \, \left( U_x \cap \{y\}  = \emptyset \right)\right) \right)$

###### Proposition
**($T_0$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is $T_0$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace})
precisely if the function $Cl(\{-\})$
from the underlying set of $X$ to the set of [[irreducible closed subsets]] of $X$ (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible},
which is well defined according to example \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}), is [[injective function|injective]]:

$$
  Cl(\{-\}) \;\colon\; X \hookrightarrow IrrClSub(X)
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume first that $X$ is $T_0$. Then we need to show that if $x,y \in X$ are such that
$Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$ then $x = y$. Hence assume that $Cl(\{x\}) = Cl(\{y\})$.
Since the closure of a point is the [[complements]] of the union of the open subsets not containing the point,
this means that the union of open subsets that do not contain $x$
is the same as the union of open subsets that do not contain $y$. Hence every
open subset that does not contain $x$ also does not contain $y$, and vice versa.
By $T_0$ this is not the case when $x \neq y$, hence it follows that $x = y$.

Conversely, assume that if $x,y \in X$ are such that $Cl\{x\} = Cl\{y\}$ then $x = y$.
We need to show that if $x \neq y$ then there exists an open neighbourhood around one of the
two points not containing the other. Hence assume that $x \neq y$.
By assumption it follows that $Cl(\{x\} \neq Cl(\{y\})$.
Since the closure of a point is the [[complements]] of the union of the open subsets not containing the point, this
means that there must be at least one open subset which contains $x$ but not $y$, or vice versa.
By definition this means that $(X,\tau)$ is $T_0$.

###### Proposition
**($T_1$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) precisely if
all its points are [[closed points]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume first that $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$. We need to show that for every point $x \in X$ we have
$Cl(\{x\}) = \{x\}$. Since the closure of a point is the [[complement]] of the union of all open subsets not containing this point,
this is the case precisely if the union of all open subsets not containing $x$ is $X \backslash \{x\}$, hence
if every point $y \neq x$ is member of at least one open subset not containing $x$. This is true by $T_1$.

Conversely, assume that for all $x \in X$ then $Cl(\{x\}) = \{x\}$. Then for $x \neq y \in X$ two
distinct points we need to produce an open subset of $y$ that does not contain $x$. But as before,
since $Cl(\{x\})$ is the complement of the union of all open subsets that do not contain $x$, and
the assumption $Cl\{x\} = \{x\}$ means that $y$ is member of one of these open subsets that do not
contain $x$.

###### Proposition
**($T_2$ in terms of topological closures)**

A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau_X)$ is $T_2$=[[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace})
precisely if the [[diagonal]] function $\Delta_X \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (X \times X, \tau_{X \times X})$
(example \ref{Diagonal}) is a [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $(X,\tau_X)$ is Hausdorff, then by definition for every pair of distinct points $x \neq y \in X$ there exists open neighbourhoods
$U_x, U_y \in \tau_X$ such that $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$. In terms of the [[product topology]] (example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace})
this means that every point $(x,y) \in X \times X$ which is not on the diagonal has an open neighbourhood $U_x \times U_y$ which
still does not contain the diagonal. By definition, this means that in fact every [[subset]] of the diagonal is a
[[closed subset]] of $X \times X$, hence in particular those that are in the image under $\Delta_X$ of closed subsets of $X$.
Hence $\Delta_X$ is a closed map.

Conversely, if $\Delta_X$ is a closed map, then the full diagonal (i.e. the image of $X$ under $\Delta_X$) is closed in $X \times X$,
and hence this means that every points $(x,y) \in X \times X$ not on the diagonal has an open neighbourhood $U_x \times U_y$
not containing the diagonal, i.e. such that $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$. Hence $X$ is Hausdorff.

#### Hausdorff reflection
 {#HausdorffReflections}

Not every [[universal construction]] of [[topological spaces]] applied to [[Hausdorff topological spaces]]
results again in a Hausdorff topological space, notably [[quotient space]] constructions need not
(example \ref{LineWithTwoOrigins} below).

But there is a universal way, called _[[Hausdorff reflection]]_ (prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection} below),
to approximate any topological space "from the left" by a Hausdorff topological spaces.

Hence if one wishes to work withing the [[full subcategory]] of the [[Hausdorff topological spaces]]
among all [[topological space]], then the correct way to construct quotients and other _[[colimits]]_
(see [below](#UniversalConstructions)) is to first construct them as usual for topological spaces,
and then apply the Hausdorff reflection to the result.


+-- {: .num_example #LineWithTwoOrigins}
###### Example
**([[line with two origins]])**

Consider the [[disjoint union]] $\mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R}$ of two copies of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded
as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (def. \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (def. \ref{MetricTopology}). Moreover, consider the [[equivalence relation]] on the underlying set which identifies every
point $x_i$ in the $i$th copy of $\mathbb{R}$ ($i \in \{0,1\}$) with the corresponding point in the other, the $(1-i)$th copy, except when $x = 0$:

$$
  \left(
    x_i \sim y_j
  \right)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \left(
      x = y
    \right)
    \,\text{and}\,
    \left(
      \left(
        x \neq 0
      \right)
      \,\text{or}\,
      \left(
        i = j
      \right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The [[quotient topological space]] by this equivalence relation (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

$$
  \left(
    \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R}
  \right)/\sim
$$

is called the **line with two origins**.

This is a basic example of a topological space which is a [[non-Hausdorff topological space]]:

Because by definition of the [[quotient topological space|quotient space topology]], the [[open neighbourhoods]] of $0_i \in   \left( \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R} \right)/\sim$ are precisely those that contain subsets of the form

$$
 (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_i
  \;\coloneqq\;
 (-\epsilon,0) \cup \{0_i\} \cup (0,\epsilon)
 \,.
$$

But this means that the "two origins" $0_0$ and $0_1$ may not be [separated by neighbourhoods](separation+axioms#SeparatedByNeighbourhoods), since the intersection of
$(-\epsilon, \epsilon)_0$ with $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)_i$ is always non-empty:

$$
  (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_0
   \cap
  (-\epsilon, \epsilon)_1
  \;=\;
  (-\epsilon, 0) \cup (0, \epsilon)
  \,.

###### Example

Consider the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ regarded
as the 1-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (def. \ref{EuclideanNorm}) with its [[metric topology]] (def. \ref{MetricTopology})
and consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $\mathbb{R}$ which identifies two [[real numbers]] if they
differ by a [[rational number]]:

$$
  \left(
    x \sim y
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{p/q \in \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}}{\exists}
      x = y + p/q
  \right)

Then the [[quotient topological space]] (def. \ref{QuotientTopologicalSpace})

$$
  \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}

[[non-Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}).

+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflection}
###### Proposition
**(Hausdorff reflection)**

For every [[topological space]] $X$ there exists
a [[Hausdorff topological space]] $H X$ and a [[continuous function]]

$$
  h_X
    \;\colon\;
  X \longrightarrow H X
$$

which is the  "closest approximation from the left" to $X$ by a Hausdorff topological space, in that
for $Y$ any [[Hausdorff topological space]], then [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

are in [[bijection]] with [[continuous function]] of the form

$$
  \tilde f \;\colon\; H X \longrightarrow Y
$$

and such that the bijection is constituted by

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ h_X
  \;\colon\;
    X
      \overset{h_X}{\longrightarrow}
    H X
      \overset{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow}
    Y
  \,.
$$

Here $H X$ (or more precisely $h_X$) is also called the _Hausdorff reflection_ (or _Hausdorffication_ or similar) of $X$.

Moreover, the operation $H(-)$ extends to [[continuous functions]] $f \colon X \to Y$

$$
  (X \overset{f}{\to} Y)
    \;\mapsto\;
  (H X \overset{H f}{\to} H Y)
$$

by setting

$$
  H f \;\colon\; [x] \mapsto [f(x)]
  \,,
$$

where $[x]$ denotes the [[equivalence class]] under $\sim_X$ of any $x \in X$.

Finally, the comparison map is compatible with this in that the follows [[commuting squares|squares commute]]:

$$
  \array{
      X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{h_X}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_Y}}

###### Remark

In the language of [[category theory]] the Hausdorff reflection of prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}

1. $h_X \colon X \to H X$ is a [[natural transformation]] from the [[identity functor]] on [[Top]] to the functor $\iota \circ H$

1. [[Hausdorff topological spaces]] form a [[reflective subcategory]] of all [[topological spaces]] in that $H$ is [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion functor $\iota$

There are various ways to see the existence and to construct the Hausdorff reflection. The following is maybe the quickest way to see the existence, even though it leaves the actual construction rather implicit.


+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflectionViaHomsIntoAllHausdorffSpaces}
###### Proposition

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and consider the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on the underlying set $X$
for which $x \sim y$ precisely if for every [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ into any
[[Hausdorff topological space]] $Y$ we have $f(x) = f(y)$.

Then the set of [[equivalence classes]]

$$
  H X \coloneqq X /{\sim}
$$

equipped with the [[quotient topology]] is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] and the quotient map $h_X \;\colon\; X \to X/{\sim}$ exhibits the Hausdorff reflection of $X$, according to prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First observe that every continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ into a Hausdorff space $Y$
factors uniquely via $h_X$ through a continuous function $\tilde f$

$$
  f = \tilde f \circ h_X
$$

where

$$
  \tilde f \colon [x] \mapsto f(x)
  \,.
$$

That this is well defined and continuous follows directly from the definitions.

What remains to be seen is that $H X$ is indeed a Hausdorff space. Hence assume that $[x] \neq [y] \in H X$.
By construction of $H X$ this means that there exists a Hausdorff space $Y$ and a continuous function
$f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y) \in Y$. Accordingly, since $Y$ is Hausdorff,
there exist disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x, U_Y \in \tau_Y$. Moreover, by the previous statement there
exists a continuous function $\tilde f \colon H X \to Y$ with $\tilde f([x]) = f(x)$ and $\tilde f([y]) = f(y)$.
Since, by the nature of continuous functions,
the pre-images $\tilde f^{-1}( U_x ), \tilde f^{-1}([y]) \subset H X$ are still disjoint and open,
we have found disjoint neighbourhoods of $[x]$ and $[y]$. Hence $H X$ is Hausdorff.

=--

The following is a more direct way to actually construct the Hausdorff reflection:

+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffReflectionViaClosureOfDiagonal}
###### Proposition


Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and write $Cl(\Delta_X)$ for the [[topological closure]] of the [[image]] of the [[diagonal]] map

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\Delta_X}{\longrightarrow}& X \times X
     \\
     x &\mapsto& (x,x)
  }
$$

in the [[product topological space]] $X \times X$. Define an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ on $X$ to be given by $Cl(\Delta_X)$, i.e.

$$
  (x \sim y)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  (x,y) \in Cl(\Delta_X)
  \,.
$$

Then in [[classical logic]] the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  H X \coloneqq X/\sim
$$

is a Hausdorff topological space and the [[quotient]] map

$$
  h_X \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow H X
$$

exhibits $H X$ as the Hausdorff reflection of $X$, according to prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection}.

In particular this implies that $X$ is Hausdorff precisely if the diagonal $\Delta_X \colon X \to X \times X$ is a [[closed map]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Observe that two points $x,y \in X$ are not [separated by neighbourhoods](separation+axioms#SeparatedByNeighbourhoods) precisely if $(x,y) \in Cl(\Delta_X)$. Because the latter means equivalently that every basic open neighbourhood $U_x \times U_y$ of $(x,y)$ in the product topology $X \times X$ contains a point $(z,z)$ on the diagonal, which means equivalently that $z \in U_x \cap U_y$, hence equivalently that $x$ and $y$ are not separated by open neighbourhoods.

This directly implies that $X/\sim$ is Hausdorff.

To see that every continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ into a Hausdorff space $Y$ factors uniquely through this $H X$, we need to see that if $(x,y) \in Cl(\Delta_X)$ then $f(x) = f(y)$. Assume on the contrary that $f(x) \neq f(y)$. Then by $Y$ being Hausdorff, this would imply the existence of disjoint open neighbourhoods $V_{f(x)}$ and $V_{f(y)}$. By continuity of $f$, their preimages $f^{-1}(V_{f(x)})$ and $f^{-1}(V_{f(y)})$ would still be disjoint open neighbourhoods, now of $x$ and $y$, contradicting the fact that these do not exist, by the previous statement. This proves the claim [[proof by contradiction|by contradiction]].

**([[Hausdorff implies sober]])**

Every [[Hausdorff topological space]] (def. \ref{HausdorffTopologicalSpace}) is
a [[sober topological space]] (def. \ref{Sober}).

More specifically, in a Hausdorff topological space
the [[irreducible closed subspaces]] (def. \ref{ClosedIrreducible})
are precisely the [[singleton]] [[subspaces]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSubspace}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The second statement clearly implies the first. To see the second
statement, suppose that $F$ is an irreducible closed subspace which
contained two distinct points $x \neq y$. Then by the Hausdorff property
there are disjoint neighbourhoods $U_x, U_y$, and hence it would follow that
the rlative [[complements]] $F \backslash U_x$ and $F \backslash U_y$ were distinct proper closed subsets of
$F$ with

$$
  F = (F \backslash U_x) \cup (F \backslash U_y)
$$

in contradiction to the assumption that $F$ is irreducible.

This [[proof by contradiction|proves by contradiction]] that every irreducible closed subset is a singleton.
Conversely, generally the [[topological closure]] of every singleton is irreducible closed, by example \ref{IrreducibleClosureOfPoint}.

#### Frames of opens


What makes the concept of [[sober topological spaces]] special is that
for them the concept of [[continuous functions]] may be expressed entirely in terms
of the relations between their [[open subsets]], disregarding the underlying
set of points of which these open are in fact subsets.

Recall from example \ref{ContinuousFunctionGivesFrameHomomorphism}
that for very [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$
the [[pre-image]] function $f^{-1} \colon \tau_Y \to \tau_X$ is a [[frame]] [[homomorphism]]
(def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens}).

For sober topological spaces the converse holds:

+-- {: .num_prop #FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
###### Proposition

If $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ are [[sober topological spaces]] (def. \ref{Sober}), then
for every [[frame]] [[homomorphism]] (def. \ref{HomomorphismOfFramesOfOpens})

$$
  \tau_X \longleftarrow \tau_Y \;\colon\; \phi
$$

there is a unique [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ such that $\phi$ is the function
of forming [[pre-images]] under $f$:

$$
  \phi = f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof #ProofOfFrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
###### Proof

We first consider the special case of frame homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X \;\colon\; \phi
$$

and show that these are in bijection to the underlying set $X$, identified with the continuous functions
$\ast \to (X,\tau)$ via example \ref{PointsViaContinuousFunctions}.

By prop. \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub}, the frame homomorphisms $\phi \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$
are identified with the irreducible closed subspaces $X \backslash U_\emptyset(\phi)$ of $(X,\tau_X)$.
Therefore by assumption of [[sober topological space|sobriety]] of $(X,\tau)$ there is a unique point
$x \in X$ with $X \backslash U_{\emptyset} = Cl(\{x\})$. In particular this means that for $U_x$ an open
neighbourhood of $x$, then $U_x$ is not a subset of $U_\emptyset(\phi)$, and so it follows that $\phi(U_x) = \{1\}$.
In conclusion we have found a unique $x \in X$ such that

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  U \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{
      \{1\} & \vert \,\text{if}\, x \in U
      \\
      \emptyset & \vert \, \text{otherwise}
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the [[inverse image]] function of the continuous function $\ast \to X$ which sends $1 \mapsto x$.

Hence this establishes the bijection between frame homomorphisms of the form $\tau_\ast \longleftarrow \tau_X$
and continuous functions of the form $\ast \to (X,\tau)$.

With this it follows that a general frame homomorphism of the form $\tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y$
defines a function of sets $X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ by [[composition]]:

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
    \\
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X)
    &\mapsto&
    (\tau_\ast \leftarrow \tau_X \overset{\phi}{\longleftarrow} \tau_Y)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the previous analysis, an element $U_Y \in \tau_Y$ is sent to $\{1\}$ under this composite precisely if
the corresponding point $\ast \to X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is in $U_Y$, and similarly for
an element $U_X \in \tau_X$. It follows that $\phi(U_Y) \in \tau_X$ is precisely that subset of
points in $X$ which are sent by $f$ to elements of $U_Y$, hence that $\phi = f^{-1}$ is the [[pre-image]]
function of $f$. Since $\phi$ by definition sends open subsets of $Y$ to open subsets of $X$, it follows
that $f$ is indeed a continuous function. This proves the claim in generality.

###### Remark
**(locales)**

Proposition \ref{FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces}
is often stated as saying that sober topological spaces are [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the
"[[locales with enough points]]" ([Johnstone 82, II 1.](#Johnstone82)). Here "[[locale]]" refers to a concept akin to topological spaces where one considers
_just_ a "[[frame of open subsets]]" $\tau_X$, without requiring that its elements be actual [[subsets]] of some ambient set.
The natural notion of [[homomorphism]] between such generalized topological spaces are clearly the [[frame]] homomorphisms
$\tau_X \leftarrow \tau_Y$ as above. From this persepctive, prop. \ref{FrameMorphismsBetweenOpensOfSoberSpaces} says that
sober topological spaces $(X, \tau_X)$ are entirely characterized by their [[frames of opens]] $\tau_X$ and just so happen to
"have enough points" such that these are actual open subsets of some ambient set, namely of $X$.

#### Sober reflection

We saw above in prop. \ref{HausdorffReflection} that every toopological space has a "best approximation from the left" by a [[Hausdorff topological space]]. We now discuss the analogous statement for [[sober topological spaces]].


Recall again the [[point]] topological space $\ast \coloneqq ( \{1\}, \tau_\ast = \left\{ \emptyset, \{1\}\right\} )$
(example \ref{Point}).

###### Definition

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]].

Define $S X$ to be the set

$$
  S X \coloneqq Hom_{Frame}( \tau_X, \tau_\ast )
$$

of [[frame]] [[homomorphisms]] from the [[frame of opens]] of $X$ to that of the point. Define a [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_{S X} \subset P(S X)$ on this set by declaring it to have one element $\tilde U$ for each element $U \in \tau_X$ and given by

$$
  \tilde U
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    \phi \in S X
    \,\vert\,
    \phi(U) = \{1\}
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Consider the function

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{s_X}{\longrightarrow}& S X
    \\
    x &\mapsto& (const_x)^{-1}
  }
$$

which sends an element $x \in X$ to the function which assigns [[inverse images]] of the [[constant function]] $const_x \;\colon\; \{1\} \to X$ on that element.

###### Lemma

The construction $(S X, \tau_{S X})$ in def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction} is a [[topological space]], and the function $s_X \colon X \to S X$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  s_X \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (S X, \tau_{S X})
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof #ProofOfSoberificationConstructionWellDefined}
###### Proof

To see that $\tau_{S X} \subset P(S X)$ is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, observe that the function

$$
  \array{
    \tau_X &\overset{\widetilde{(-)}}{\longrightarrow}& \tau_{S X}
    \\
    U &\mapsto& \tilde U
  }
$$

in fact preserves arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Whith this the statement follows by the fact that $\tau_X$ is closed under these operations.

To see that $\widetilde{(-)}$ indeed preserves unions, observe that (e.g. [Johnstone 82, II 1.3 Lemma](#Johnstone82))

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p \in \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \widetilde{U_i} \;
    & \Leftrightarrow
    \underset{i \in I}{\exists} p(U_i) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow \underset{i \in I}{\cup} p(U_i) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p\left(\underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i\right) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p \in \widetilde{ \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i }
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used that the frame homomorphism $p \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ preserves unions. Similarly for intersections, now with $I$ a [[finite set]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    p \in \underset{i \in I}{\cap} \widetilde{U_i} \;
    & \Leftrightarrow
    \underset{i \in I}{\forall} p(U_i) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow \underset{i \in I}{\cap} p(U_i) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p\left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_i\right) = \{1\}
    \\
    & \Leftrightarrow p \in \widetilde{ \underset{i \in I}{\cap} U_i }
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where now we used that the frame homomorphism $p$ preserves finite intersections.

To see that $s_X$ is continuous, observe that $s_X^{-1}(\tilde U) = U$, by construction.

###### Lemma

For $(X, \tau_X)$ a [[topological space]],
the function $s_X \colon X \to S X$ from def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction} is

1. an [[injection]] precisely if $X$ is [[separation axiom|T0]];

1. a [[bijection]] precisely if $X$ is sober.

By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} there is an identification $S X \simeq IrrClSub(X)$ and via this $s_X$ is identified with the map $x \mapsto Cl(\{x\})$.

Hence the second statement follows by definition, and the first statement by [this prop.](separation+axioms#T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints).

That in the second case $s_X$ is in fact a homeomorphism follows from the definition of the opens $\tilde U$: they are identified with the opens $U$ in this case (...expand...).

For $(X,\tau)$ a [[topological space]], then the topological space $(S X, \tau_{S X})$ from def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined} is sober.

=--

(e.g. [Johnstone 82, lemma II 1.7](#Johnstone82))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $S X \backslash \tilde U$ be an [[irreducible closed subspace]] of $(S X, \tau_{S X})$. We need to show that it is the [[topological closure]] of a unique element $\phi \in S X$.

Observe first that also $X \backslash U$ is irreducible.

To see this use [this prop.](irreducible+closed+subspace#OpenSubsetVersionOfClosedIrreducible), saying that irreducibility of $X \backslash U$ is equivalent to $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U \Rightarrow (U_1 \subset U) or (U_2 \subset U)$. But if $U_1 \cap U_2 \subset U$ then also $\tilde U_1 \cap \tilde U_2 \subset \tilde U$ (as in the [proof](#ProofOfSoberificationConstructionWellDefined) of lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined}) and hence by assumption on $\tilde U$ it follows that $\tilde U_1 \subset \tilde U$ or $\tilde U_2 \subset \tilde U$. By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} this in turn implies $U_1 \subset U$ or $U_2 \subset U$.  In conclusion, this shows that also $X \backslash U$ is irreducible .

By lemma \ref{FrameHomomorphismsToPointAreIrrClSub} this irreducible closed subspace corresponds to a point $p \in S X$. By that same lemma, this frame homomorphism $p \colon \tau_X \to \tau_\ast$ takes the value $\emptyset$ on all those opens which are inside $U$. This means that the [[topological closure]] of this point is just $S X \backslash \tilde U$.

This shows that there exists at least one point of which $X \backslash \tilde U$ is the topological closure. It remains to see that there is no other such point.

So let $p_1 \neq p_2 \in S X$ be two distinct points. This means that there exists $U \in \tau_X$ with $p_1(U) \neq p_2(U)$. Equivalently this says that $\tilde U$ contains one of the two points, but not the other. This means that $(S X, \tau_{S X})$ is [[separation axiom|T0]]. By [this prop.](separation+axioms#T0InTermsOfClosureOfPoints) this is equivalent to there being no two points with the same topological closure.

###### Proposition

For $(X, \tau_X)$ any [[topological space]], for $(Y,\tau_Y^{sob})$ a sober topological space, and for $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ a [[continuous function]], then it factors uniquely through the soberification $s_X \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (S X, \tau_{S X})$ from def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, lemma \ref{SoberificationConstructionWellDefined}

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\exists !}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})

$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the construction in def. \ref{SoberificationConstruction}, we the outer part of the following square [[commuting square|commutes]]:

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau^{sob}_Y)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{s_{S X}}}
    \\
    (S X, \tau_{S X})
     &\underset{S f}{\longrightarrow}&
    (S S X, \tau_{S S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

By lemma \ref{SoberificationIsIndeedSober} and lemma \ref{UnitIntoSXDetectsT0AndSoberity}, the right vertical morphism $s_{S X}$ is an isomorphism (a [[homeomorphism]]), hence has an [[inverse morphism]]. This defines the diagonal morphism, which is the desired factorization.

To see that this factorization is unique, consider two factorizations $\tilde f, \overline{f} \colon \colon (S X, \tau_{S X}) \to (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})$ and apply the soberification construction once more to the triangles

$$
  \array{
    (X, \tau_X) &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s_X}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{ \tilde f, \overline{f}}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \phantom{AAA}
    \mapsto
  \phantom{AAA}
  \array{
    (S X, \tau_{S X}) &\overset{S f}{\longrightarrow}& (Y, \tau_Y^{sob})
    \\
    {}^{\simeq}\downarrow & \nearrow_{ \tilde f, \overline{f}}
    \\
    (S X , \tau_{S X})
  }
  \,.
$$

Here on the right we used again lemma \ref{UnitIntoSXDetectsT0AndSoberity} to find that the vertical morphism is an isomorphism, and that $\tilde f$ and $\overline{f}$ do not change under soberification, as they already map between sober spaces. But now that the left vertical morphism is an isomorphism, the commutativity of this triangle for both $\tilde f$ and $\overline{f}$ implies that $\tilde f = \overline{f}$.

### Compact spaces
 {#CompactSpaces}

From the discussion of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[metric spaces]] in
def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact} and prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace}
it is now immediate how to generalize these concepts to [[topological spaces]].

The most naive version of the definition directly generalizes the concept via converging
sequences from def. \ref{MetricSpaceSequentiallyCompact}:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSpaceSequeneConverging}
###### Definition
**(converging sequence in a topological space)**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}) and let
$(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[sequence]] of points $(x_n)$ in $X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}).
We say that this sequence _[[convergence|converges]]_ in $(X,\tau)$ to a point $x_\infty \in X$,
denoted

$$
  x_n \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
$$

if for each open [[neighbourhood]] $U_{x_\infty}$ of $x_\infty$ there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
for all $n \geq k$ then $x_n \in U_{x_\infty}$:

$$
  \left(
    x_n \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_\infty
  \right)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \underset{{U_{x_\infty} \in \tau_X} \atop {x_\infty \in U_{X_\infty}}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
    \left(
      \underset{n \geq k}{\forall}
        \, x_n \in U_{x_\infty} \,
    \right)

###### Definition
**([[sequentially compact topological space]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace}). It is called
_[[sequentially compact topological space|sequentially compact]]_ if for every [[sequence]]
of points $(x_n)$ in $X$ (def. \ref{Sequences}) there exists a sub-sequence $(x_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$
which [[convergence|converges]] acording to def. \ref{TopologicalSpaceSequeneConverging}.

But prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace} suggests to consider
also another definition of compactness for topological spaces:

**([[open cover]])**

An _[[open cover]]_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalSpace})

indexed by some [[set]] $I$, such that their [[union]] is all of $X$:

 a _finite subcover_ in that there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that
 $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in J}$ is still a cover of $X$ in that  $\underset{i \in J}{\cup} U_i = X$.

###### Remark
**(terminology issue regarding "compact")**

Beware that the following terminology issue persists in the literature:

Some authors use "compact" to mean "[[compact Hausdorff space|Hausdorff and compact]]". To disambiguate this,
some authors (mostly in [[algebraic geometry]]) say "quasi-compact" for what we call
"compact" in prop. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace}.

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

A [[discrete topological space]] (def. \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) is [[compact topological space|compact]] (def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace})
precisely if its underlying set is [[finite set|finite]].

=--

In terms of these definitions, the familiar statement about metric spaces from prop. \ref{CompactnessImpliedBySequentialCompactnessForMetricSpace} now says equivalently that
[[sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]]. But for
general topological spaces being sequntially compact neighther implies nor is implied by being compact (...examples...).


In [[analysis]] the [[extreme value theorem]] asserts that a [[real number|real]]-valued [[continuous function]]
on the [[bounded subset|bounded]] [[closed interval]] (def. \ref{OpenAndClosedIntervals}) attains its
[[maximum]] and [[minimum]]. The following is the generalization of this statement to general topological spaces:

**([[continuous surjections out of compact spaces have compact codomain]])**

Let $f \colon (X,\tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y,\tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]];

1. $f \colon X \to Y$ is a [[surjective function]].

Then also $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $Y$. We need show that this has a finite sub-cover.

By the continuity of $f$ the [[pre-images]] $f^{-1}(U_i)$ are [[open subsets]] of $X$, and by the surjectivity of $f$ they form an [[open cover]] $\{f^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$. Hence by compactness of $X$, there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that
$\{f^{-1}(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $X$. Finall, using again that $f$ is assumed to be surjective, it follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Y
      & = f(X)
    \\
      & = f\left( \underset{i \in J}{\cup} f^{-1}(U_i) \right)
    \\
      & = \underset{i \in J}{\cup} U_i
  \end{aligned}
$$

which means that also $\{U_i \subset Y\}_{i \in J \subset I}$ is still an open cover of $Y$, and in particular a finite subcover of the original cover.

+-- {: .num_cor #ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact}
###### Corollary
**([[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]])**

If $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[continuous function]] out of a [[compact topological space]] $X$ which is not necessarily [[surjective function|surjective]], then we may consider its [[image]] factorization

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow im(f) \hookrightarrow Y
$$

with $im(f)$ regarded as a [[topological subspace]] of $Y$. Now by construction $X \to \im(f)$ is surjective, and so lemma \ref{ContinuousSurjectionOutOfCompactSpaceHasCompactCodomain} implies that $im(f)$ is compact.

=--

The converse to cor. \ref{ContinuousImageOfACompactSpaceIsCompact} does not hold in general: the
pre-image of a compact subset under a continuous function need not be compact again. If this is
the case, then we speak of _[[proper maps]]_:

###### Definition
**([[proper maps]])**

of $Y$, then also its [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(C)$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] in $X$.

###### Definition
**([[mapping space]])**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]]

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous
functions]] $Y \to X$,

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[unions]] of [[finitary intersections]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] elements of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U^K \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

Then for a [[topological subspace]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the following are equivalent:

1. $S$ is  [[compact topological space|compact]] according to def. \ref{CompactTopologicalSpace},

1. $S$ is [[closed subset|closed]] (def. \ref{ClosedSubset}) and [[bounded subset|bounded]] (def. \ref{MetricSpaceBoundedSubset}).

Let $\{V_i \subset Y\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $Y$. We need to show that this has a finite sub-cover.

By definition of the [[topological subspace|subspace topology]], there exist open subsets $U_i$ of $X$ with

$$
  V_i = U_i \cap Y
  \,.
$$

By the assumption that $Y$ is closed, the [[complement]] $X \backsalsh Y$ is an open subset of $X$, and therefore

$$
  \{ X \backslash Y \subset X\} \cup \{ U_i \subset X \}_{i \in I}
$$

is an [[open cover]] of $X$. Now by the assumption that $X$ is compact, this latter cover has a finite subcover,
hence there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J \subset I$ such that

$$
  \{ X \backslash Y \subset X\} \cup \{ U_i \subset X \}_{i \in J \subset I}
$$

is still an oopen cover of $X$, hence in particular intersects to a finite open cover of $Y$.
But since $Y \cap ( X \backsalsh Y ) = \empty$, it follows that indeed

$$
  \{V_i \subset Y\}_{i \in J \subset I}
$$

is a cover of $Y$, and in indeed a finite subcover of the original one.

Let $x \in X \backslash K$ be any point of $X$ not contained in $K$. We need to show that there exists an [[open neighbourhood]] of $x$ in $X$ which does not [[intersection|intersect]] $X$.

By assumption that $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist for each $y \in K$ disjoint open neighbourhoods $y \subset U_y \subset X$ and $x \subset V_y \subset X$. Clearly the [[union]] of all the $U_y$ is an [[open cover]] of $K$

$$
  K \subset \underset{y \in K}{\cup} U_y

Hence by assumption that $K$ is compact, there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $S \subset K$ of points in $K$ such that the $U_s$ for $s \in S$ still cover $K$:

###### Corollary ######
**([[continuous bijections from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphisms]])**

Let $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)$ be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that

1. $(X,\tau_X)$ is a [[compact topological space]];

1. $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is a [[Hausdorff topological space]].

1. $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a [[bijection]] of [[sets]].

Then $f$ is a [[homeomorphism]], i. e. its [[inverse function]] $Y \to X$ is also a [[continuous function]].

In particular then both $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ are [[compact Hausdorff spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $g \colon Y \to X$ for the [[inverse function]] of $f$.

We need to show that $g$ is continuous, hence that for $U \subset X$ an [[open subset]], then also its [[pre-image]] $g^{-1}(U) \subset Y$ is open in $Y$.
By prop. \ref{ClosedSubsetContinuity} this is equivalent to the statement that for $ \subset X$ a [[closed subset]] then the [[pre-image]] $g^{-1}(C) \subset Y$ is also closed in $Y$.

But since $g$ is the [[inverse function]] to $f$, its [[pre-images]] are the [[images]] of $f$. Hence the last statement above equivalently says that $f$ sends closed subsets to closed subsets. This is true by prop. \ref{MapsFromCompactSpacesToHausdorffSpacesAreClosed}.

Let $I$ be a [[small category]] and let $X_\bullet \colon I \longrightarrow Top$ be an $I$-[[diagram]] in [[Top]] (a [[functor]] from $I$ to $Top$), with components denoted $X_i = (S_i, \tau_i)$, where $S_i \in Set$ and $\tau_i$ a topology on $S_i$. Then:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies} for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

any [[cone]] over the diagram, then by construction there is a unique function of underlying sets $S \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i$ making the required diagrams commute, and so all that is required is that this unique function is always [[continuous function|continuous]]. But this is precisely what the initial topology ensures.

## Basic homotopy theory


In order to handle topological spaces, to compute their properties and distinguish them, it
turns out to be useful to consider not just continuity within a topological space, but also
continuous deformations of [[continuous functions]] _between_ topological spaces. This is the
concept of _[[homotopy]]_, and its study is _[[homotopy theory]]_. We introduce the basic concept
and consider its most fundamental application: the [[fundamental group]] and its relation to the
classification of [[covering spaces]].


### Homotopy
  {#Homotopy}

We have seen above that for $n \geq 1$  then the [[open ball]] $B_0^\circ(1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is _not_ [[homeomorphic]] to, notably, the point $\ast = \mathbb{R}^0$ (example \ref{OpenBallsHomeomorphicToRn}, theorem \ref{TopologicalInvarianceOfDimension}). Nevertheless, intuitively the $n$-ball is a "continuous deformation" of the point, obtained as the radius of the $n$-ball tends to zero.

This intuition is made precise by observing that there is a [[continuous function]] out of the [[product topological space]]
(example \ref{BinaryProductTopologicalSpace}) of the open ball with the closed [[interval]]

$$
  \eta \colon [0,1] \times B_0^\circ(1)  \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which is given by rescaling:

$$
  (t,x) \mapsto t \cdot x
  \,.
$$

This continuously interpolates between the open ball and the point in that for $t = 1$ then it restricts to the defining inclusion $B_0^\circ(1)$, while for $t = 0$ then it restricts to the map constant on the origin.

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/ShrinkingBalls.png" width="200">
</div>

We may summarize this situation by saying that there is a
[[diagram]] of [[continuous functions]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    B_0^\circ(1) \times \{0\}
    \\
    \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{x \mapsto 0}}
    \\
    [0,1] \times B_0^\circ(1)
    &\overset{(t,x) \mapsto t \cdot x}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    \uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{inclusion}}
    \\
    B_0^\circ(1) \times \{1\}
  }
$$

### Connected components

Using the concept of [[homotopy]] one obtains the basic tool of [[algebraic topology]], namely the construction of algebraic [[homotopy invariants]] of topological spaces. We introduce the simplest and indicate their use.


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

A [[homotopy]] between two points

$x,y \;\colon\; \ast \to X$

is a continuous [[path]] between these points.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #pi0}
###### Definition
**(connected components)**

The set of [[homotopy classes]] of points in a [[topological space]] $X$ is called its set of
_path-[[connected components]]_, denoted.

$$
  \pi_0(X) \in Set
  \,.
$$

If $\pi_0(X) \simeq \ast$ consists of a single element, we say that $X$ is a _[[path-connected topological space]]_.

If $f \colon X \to Y$ is a [[continuous map]] between [[topological spaces]], then on [[homotopy classes]] of points it induces a [[function]] between the corresponding connected components, which we denote by:

$$
  \pi_0(f) \;\colon\; \pi_0(X) \longrightarrow \pi_0(Y)
  \,.
$$

=--

This construction is evidently compatible with [[composition]], in that

$$
  \pi_0(g \circ f) = \pi_0(g) \circ \pi_0(f)
$$

and it evidently is [[unitality|unital]], in that

$$
  \pi_0(id_X) = id_{\pi_{0}(X)}
  \,.
$$

One summarizes this by saying that $\pi_0$ is a _[[functor]]_ from the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] to the [[category]] [[Set]] of [[sets]], denoted

$$
  \pi_0 \;\colon\; Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

An immediate but important consequence is this:

+-- {: .num_prop #ConnectedComponentsDistinctImpliesHeomeClassesDistinct}
###### Proposition

If two [[topological spaces]] have sets of [[connected components]] that are not in [[bijection]], then those spaces are not [[homeomorphic]] to each other:

$$
  \pi_0(X) \neq \pi_0(Y)
  \;\;\;
    \Rightarrow
  \;\;\,
  X \underset{homeo}{\neq} Y
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $\pi_0$ is [[functor|functorial]], it immediately follows that it sends [[isomorphisms]] to [[isomorphisms]], hence [[homeomorphisms]] to [[bijections]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     & f \circ g = id \;\;and\;\; g \circ f = id
    \\
    \Rightarrow \;\;\;\;\;\;&
    \pi_0(f \circ g) = \pi_0(id) \;\;and \;\; \pi_0(g \circ f) = \pi_0(id)
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;\;
    &
    \pi_0(f) \circ \pi_0(g) = id \;\;and \;\; \pi_0(g) \circ \pi_0(f) = id
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalInvarianceOfDimensionFirstSimpleCase}
###### Proposition
**([[topological invariance of dimension]] -- first simple case)**

The [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ are not [[homeomorphic]] (def. \ref{Homeomorphism}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume there were a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  f \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2
$$

we will derive a contradiction. If $f$ is a homeomorphism, then clearly so is its restriction to the [[topological subspaces]] (example \ref{SubspaceTopology}) obtained by removing $0 \in \mathbb{R}^1$ and $f(0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

$$
  f
    \;\colon\;
  (\mathbb{R}^1-\{0\})
    \longrightarrow
  (\mathbb{R}^2 - \{f(0)\})
  \,.
$$


It follows that we would get a bijection of [[connected components]] between $\pi_0(\mathbb{R}^1 - \{0\})$ and $\pi_0(\mathbb{R}^2  - \{f(0)\})$. But clearly the first set has two elements, while the second has just one:

$$
  \pi_0(\mathbb{R}^1-\{0\})
    \;\neq\;
  \pi_0(\mathbb{R}^2 - \{f(0)\})
  \,.

for, to start with, the set of [[homotopy classes]] of [[paths]] in $X$ that start and end at $x$. Such paths are also called the continuous [[loops]] in $X$ based at $x$.

1. Under concatenation of loops, $\pi_1(X,x)$ becomes a [[semi-group]].

1. The constant loop is a [[neutral element]] under this composition (thus making $\pi_1(X,x)$ a "[[monoid]]").

1. The  reverse of a loop is its [[inverse]] in $\pi_1(X,x)$, making $\pi_1(X,x)$ indeed into a [[group]].

This is called the _[[fundamental group]]_ of $X$ at $x$.

Again, this operation is [[functor|functorial]], now on the [[category]] $Top^{\ast/}$
of [[pointed topological spaces]], whose [[objects]] are
topological spaces equipped with a chosen point, and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]]
$f \colon X \to Y$ that take the chosen basepoint of $X$ to that of $Y$:

$$
  \pi_1 \;\colon\; Top^{\ast/} \longrightarrow Grp
  \,.
$$

As $\pi_0$, so also $\pi_1$ is a topological invariant. As before, we may use this to prove a simple case of the theorem of the [[topological invariance of dimension]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplyConnected}
###### Definition

A topological space $X$ for which

1. $\pi_0(X) \simeq \ast$ ([[path-connected topological space|path connected]], def. \ref{pi0})

1. $\pi_1(X,x) \simeq 1$ (the [[fundamental group]] is [[trivial group|trivial]], def. \ref{FundamentalGroup}),

is called _[[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]_.

+-- {: .num_prop #topologicalInvarianceOfDimensionSecondSimpleCase}
###### Proposition
**([[topological invariance of dimension]] -- second simple case)**

There is _no_ [[homeomorphism]] between $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Assume there were such a homeomorphism $f$; we will derive a contradiction.

If $f$ is a homeomorphism, then so is its restriction to removing the origin from $\mathbb{R}^2$
and $f(0)$ from $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$
  (\mathbb{R}^2 - \{0\})
    \longrightarrow
  (\mathbb{R}^3 - \{f(0)\})
  \,.
$$

Thse two spaces are both path-connected, hence $\pi_0$ does not distiguish them.

But they do have different [[fundamental groups]] $\pi_1$:

1. The fundamental group of $\mathbb{R}^{2} - \{0\}$ is $\mathbb{Z}$ (counting the winding of loops around the removed point).
We discuss this further below in example \ref{FundamentalGroupOfTheCircle}.

1. The fundamental group of $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{f(0)\}$ is trivial: because the single removed point is
no obstruction to sliding loops past it and contracting them.

But since passing to fundamental groups is [[functor|functorial]], the same argument
as in the proof of prop. \ref{ConnectedComponentsDistinctImpliesHeomeClassesDistinct}
shows that $f$ cannot be an [[isomorphism]], hence not a [[homeomorphism]].


=--

We now discuss a "dual incarnation" of fundamental groups, which often helps to compute them.

### Covering spaces
 {#CoveringSpaces}

+-- {: .num_defn #CoveringSpace}
###### Definition
**(covering space)**

A _[[covering space]]_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a [[continuous map]]

$$
  p \colon E \to X
$$

such that there exists an [[open cover]] $\underset{i}{\sqcup}U_i \to X$, such that restricted
to each $U_i$ then $E \to X$ is [[homeomorphic]] over $U_i$
to the [[product topological space]] (example \ref{ProductTopologicalSpace}) of $U_i$
with the [[discrete topological space]] (example \ref{CoDiscreteTopology}) on a [[set]] $F_i$

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \times F_i &\longrightarrow&  E
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

For $x \in U_i \subset X$ a point, then the elements in $F_x  = F_i$ are called the _leaves_ of the covering at $x$.

Regard the [[circle]] $S^1 = \{ z \in \mathbb{C}  \;\vert\; {\vert z\vert} = 1 \}$ as the [[topological subspace]]
of elements of unit [[absolute value]] in the [[complex plane]].
For $k \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the continuous function

$$
  p \coloneqq (-)^k \;\colon\; S^1 \longrightarrow S^1
$$

given by taking a complex number to its $k$th power. This may be thought of as the
result of "winding the circle $k$ times around itself".
Precisely, for $k \geq 1$ this is a [[covering space]]
(def. \ref{CoveringSpace}) with $k$ leaves at each point.

   $$
     t \mapsto ( cos(2\pi t), sin(2\pi t) )

   $$

We may think of this as the result of "winding the line around the circle ad infinitum".
Precisely, this is a [[covering space]] (def. \ref{CoveringSpace}) with the [[leaves]] at each point forming the
set $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[natural numbers]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ActionOfFundamentalGroupOnFibersOfCovering}
###### Definition
**(action of fundamental group on fibers of covering)**

Let $E \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} X$ be a [[covering space]] (def. \ref{CoveringSpace})

Then for $x \in X$ any point, and any choice of element $e \in F_x$ of the [[leaf space]] over $x$,
there is, up to [[homotopy]], a unique way to lift a representative
path in $X$ of an element $\gamma$ of the the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$ (def. \ref{FundamentalGroup}) to a
continuous path in $E$ that starts at $e$. This path necessarily ends at some (other) point $\rho_\gamma(e) \in F_x$
in the same [[fiber]]. This construction provides a [[function]]

$$
  \array{
    \rho &\colon& F_x \times \pi_1(X,x) &\longrightarrow& F_x
    \\
    && (e,\gamma) &\mapsto& \rho_\gamma(e)
  }
$$

from the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[leaf space]] with the [[fundamental group]]. This function
is compatible with the [[group]]-structure on $\pi_1(X,x)$, in that the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    F_x \times \{const_x\} && \longrightarrow && F_x \times \pi_1(X,x)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{id}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    && F_x
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \text{the neutral element,}
    \\
    \text{i.e. the constant loop,}
    \\
    \text{acts trivially}
  }
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  \array{
    F_x \times \pi_1(X,x) \times \pi_1(X,x)
      &\overset{\rho \times id}{\longrightarrow}&
    F_x \times \pi_1(X,x)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \times ((-)\cdot(-))}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    F_x \times \pi_1(X,x)
      &\underset{\rho}{\longrightarrow}&
    F_x
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \text{acting with two group elements }
    \\
    \text{is the same as}
    \\
    \text{first multiplying them}
    \\
    \text{ and then acting with their product element}
  }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

One says that $\rho$ is an _[[action]]_ or _[[permutation representation]]_ of $\pi_1(X,x)$ on $F_x$.

For $G$ any [[group]], then there is a [[category]] $G Set$ whose [[objects]] are [[sets]]
equipped with an [[action]] of $G$, and whose [[morphisms]] are [[function|functions]] which respect
these actions. The above construction yields a [[functor]]

We are now ready to state the main theorem about the [[fundamental group]]. Except that it
does require the following slightly technical condition on the base topological space.
This condition is satisfied for all "reasonable" topological spaces:

+-- {: .num_defn #SemiLocallySimplyConnected}
###### Definition
**(semi-locally simply connected)**

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called

1. _[[locally path-connected]]_ if for every point $x \in X$ and for every [[neighbourhood]] $x \in U \subset X$ there
   exists a neighbourhood $x \in V \subset U$ such that $V$ is [[path-connected topological space|path-connected]] (def. \ref{pi0});

1. _[[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]]_ if every point $x \in X$ has a [[neighbourhood]] $x \in U \subset X$ such that the induced morphism of [[fundamental groups]] $\pi_1(U,x) \to \pi_1(X,x)$ is trivial (i.e. sends everything to the [[neutral element]]).

=--



+-- {: .num_theorem #FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}
###### Theorem
**([[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] which is [[connected topological space|path-connected]] (def. \ref{pi0}),
[[locally path-connected topological space|locally path connected]] (def. \ref{SemiLocallySimplyConnected})
and [[semi-locally simply connected topological space|semi-locally simply connected]] (def. \ref{SemiLocallySimplyConnected}). Then
for any $x \in X$ the functor
$$
  Fib_x \;\colon\; Cov(X) \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \pi_1(X,x) Set
  \,.
$$
from def. \ref{ActionOfFundamentalGroupOnFibersOfCovering} that describes
the [[action]] of the [[fundamental group]] of $X$ on the set of [[leaves]] over $x$
has the following property:

1. every [[isomorphism class]] of $\pi_1(X,x)$-[[actions]] is in the image of the functor (one says: the functor is _[[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]_);

1. for any two covering spaces $E_1, E_2$ of $X$ then the map on [[hom-sets|morphism sets]]

   $$
     Fib_x \;\colon\; Hom_{Cov(X)}(E_1, E_2) \longrightarrow Hom( Fib_x(E_1), Fib_x(E_2) )
   $$

   is a [[bijection]] (one says the functor is a _[[fully faithful functor]]_ ).


A functor with these two properties one calls an _[[equivalence of categories]]_:

$$
  Cov(X) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_1(X,x) Set
  \,.
$$

=--

This has some interesting implications:

Every sufficiently nice topological space $X$ as above has a covering which is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]
(def. \ref{SimplyConnected}). This is the covering corresponding, under the [[fundamental theorem of covering spaces]]
(theorem \ref{FundamentalTheoremOfCoveringSpaces}) to the action of $\pi_1(X)$ on itself.
This is called the _[[universal covering space]]_ $\hat X \to X$. The above theorem implies that the
[[fundamental group]] itself may be recovered as the [[automorphisms]] of the universal covering space:

$$
  \pi_1(X) \simeq Aut_{Cov_{/X}}(\hat X, \hat X)
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_example #FundamentalGroupOfTheCircle}
###### Example
**(computing the fundamental group of the circle)**

The covering $\exp(2\pi i(-)) \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \to S^1$ from example \ref{CoveringOfCircleByRealLine}
is [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] (def. \ref{SimplyConnected}),  hence must be the [[universal covering space]], up to [[homeomorphism]].

It is fairly straightforward to see that the only [[homeomorphisms]] from $\mathbb{R}^1$ to itself
over $S^1$ are given by [[integer]] translations by $n \in \mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^1
      &&
        \underoverset{\simeq}{t \mapsto t + n}{\longrightarrow}
      &&
    \mathbb{R}^1
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\exp(2 \pi i(-))}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\exp(2 \pi i(-))}}
    \\
    && S^1
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence

$$
  Aut_{Cov_{/S^1}}(\hat S^1, \hat S^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
$$

and hence the [[fundamental group]] of the [[circle]] is the additive group of [[integers]]:

$$
  \pi_1(S^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$
