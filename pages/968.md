## Definition


A **cyclic set** is a [[presheaf]] on the _[[cyclic category]]_ (which is often called [[Connes' cyclic category]] though it is cocyclic, with the usual contravariant confusion), which is intermediate between a [[symmetric set]] and a [[simplicial set]]. With [[Set]] replaced by a general [[category]] one speaks of a _[[cyclic object]]_.

The concept of cyclic sets/objects is used in the description of the cyclic structure on [[Hochschild homology]]/[[Hochschild cohomology]] and hence for the discussion on [[cyclic homology]]/[[cyclic cohomology]].

Just like the [[category]] of [[geometric shapes for higher structures|shapes]] for [[simplicial sets]] (the [[simplex category]]) may be identified with the full [[subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the finite nonempty [[ordinals]] $[n]$;  and like the shape category for [[symmetric sets]] ([[FinSet]]) may be identified with the full subcategory of [[Cat]] on their [[localizations]] $[n]^{-1}[n]$, so the [[cycle category]] $\Lambda$, is the full subcategory of [[Cat]] whose [[objects]] are the categories $[n]_\Lambda$ which are freely generated by the graph $0\to 1\to 2\to\ldots\to n\to 0$. If the overall composition $0\to 0$ is set equal to identity we obtain symmetric sets again. 

We can also explain cyclic sets and more general [[cyclic objects]]
in terms of standard generators.

A $\mathbf{Z}$-cyclic (synonym: [[paracyclic object]])
in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[simplicial object]] $F_\bullet$ in $C$ together with
a sequence of [[isomorphisms]] $t_n : F_n \rightarrow F_n$, $n\geq 1$, such that
$$\array{
\partial_i t_n = t_{n-1} \partial_{i-1},\,\, i \gt 0, &
\sigma_i t_n = t_{n+1} \sigma_{i-1},\,\, i \gt0, \\
\partial_0 t_n = \partial_n, & \sigma_0 t_n = t_{n+1}^2 \sigma_n,
}$$
where $\partial_i$ are boundaries, $\sigma_i$ are degeneracies.
A $\mathbf Z$-cocyclic ([[paracocyclic object|paracocyclic]]) object in
$C$ is a $\mathbf{Z}$-cyclic object in $C^{\mathrm{op}}$.
$\mathbf Z$-(co)cyclic object is (co)cyclic if,
in addition, $t_n^{n+1} = 1$

## Properties

### As a classifying topos

The [[category]] of cyclic sets, being a [[presheaf category]] is a [[topos]], and hence is the [[classifying topos]] for some [[geometric theory]]. This turns out to be the theory of [[abstract circles]] ([Moerdijk 96](#Moerdijk96)). 
A further analysis can be found in ([Caramello Wentzlaff 14](#CaramelloWentzlaff14)).
Accordingly there is an [[infinity-action]] of the [[circle group]] on the [[geometric realization]] of a cyclic set (see also [Drinfeld 03](#Drinfeld03)).

### Model category structure and $S^1$-equivariant homotopy theory
 {#ModelCategoryStructure}

There is a [[model category]]-structure on the category of
cyclic sets, which makes it a presentation for
$S^1$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]] ([Spalinski 95](#Spalinski95), [Blumberg 04](#Blumberg04)).
