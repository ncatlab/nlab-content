## Definition


A **cyclic set** is a [[presheaf]] on a particular category $\Lambda$ defined by [[Alain Connes]] (which is usually called [[Connes' cyclic category]] though it is cocyclic, with the usual contravariant confusion), which is intermediate between a [[symmetric set]] and a [[simplicial set]].

The [[geometric shapes for higher structures|shape]] category for simplicial sets (the [[simplex category]]) can be identified with the full subcategory of $Cat$ on the finite nonempty ordinals $[n]$.  Likewise, the shape category for symmetric sets ([[FinSet]]) can be identified with the full subcategory of $Cat$ on their [[localization]]s $[n]^{-1}[n]$.  The shape category $\Lambda$ is the full subcategory of $\mathrm{Cat}$ whose objects are the categories $[n]_\Lambda$ which are freely generated by the graph $0\to 1\to 2\to\ldots\to n\to 0$. If the overall composition $0\to 0$ is set equal to identity we obtain symmetric sets again. 

We can also explain cyclic sets and more general objects
in terms of standard generators.

A $\mathbf{Z}$-cyclic (synonym: [[paracyclic object|paracyclic object]])
object in category $C$ is a simplicial object $F_\bullet$ in $C$ together with
a sequence of isomorphisms $t_n : F_n \rightarrow F_n$, $n\geq 1$, such that
$$\array{
\partial_i t_n = t_{n-1} \partial_{i-1},\,\, i \gt 0, &
\sigma_i t_n = t_{n+1} \sigma_{i-1},\,\, i \gt0, \\
\partial_0 t_n = \partial_n, & \sigma_0 t_n = t_{n+1}^2 \sigma_n,
}$$
where $\partial_i$ are boundaries, $\sigma_i$ are degeneracies.
A $\mathbf Z$-cocyclic ([[paracocyclic object|paracocyclic]]) object in
$C$ is a $\mathbf{Z}$-cyclic object in $C^{\mathrm{op}}$.
$\mathbf Z$-(co)cyclic object is (co)cyclic if,
in addition, $t_n^{n+1} = 1$

## Properties

### As a classifying topos

The [[category]] of cyclic sets, beting a [[presheaf category]] is a [[topos]], and hence is the [[classifying topos]] for some [[geometric theory]]. This turns out to be the theory of [[abstract circles]]. ([Moerdijk 96](#Moerdijk96)). Accordingly there is an [[infinity-action]] of the [[circle group]] on the [[geometric realization]] of a cyclic set (see also [Drinfeld 03](#Drinfeld03)).

The identification of the category of cyclic sets as the [[classifying topos]] for [[abstract circles]] is due to

The resulting circle-action on the ([[geometric realization]] of) cyclic sets is also discussed in
