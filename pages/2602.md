Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, $f: M\to \mathbb{R}$ a real valued function.

$p\in M$ is a **critical point** of $f$ if for any curve $\gamma : (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\to M$ with $\gamma(0)=p$, the vector

$$
\frac{d(f\circ\gamma)}{dt} |_{t=0} = 0.
$$

The critical point is **regular** if for one (or equivalently any) chart $\phi : U^{\open}\to \mathbb{R}^n$, where $p\in U$ and $\phi(p) = 0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, the Hessian matrix

$$\left(\frac{\partial^2 (f\circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial x^i\partial x^j}|_{0}\right)_{ij} $$

is a nondegenerate (i.e. maximal rank) matrix.  

**Morse lemma** states that for any regular critical point $p$ of $f$ there is a chart $\phi: U\to \mathb{R}^n$ around $p$ such that the function in this coordinates is quadratic:

$$(f\circ\phi^{-1})(x^1,\ldots,x^n) = f(p) +\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 - \sum_{j=k+1}^n x_j^2$$

and number $k$ is determined by the Hessian matrix. While the Morse lemma is proved by Morse, the modern proof is by the Moser deformation method.  The Morse lemma can be generalized to functions on a Hilbert manifold, in which case there is an operator $A$ such that in suitable local coordinates, $f$ can be written as <$Ax,x$>.
