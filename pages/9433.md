A rational homotopy type is "formal'' if its [[minimal model]] has differential zero. A [[dg-algebra]], or, more generally, an [[A-infinity algebra]] is formal if it is quasiisomorphic to its own (co)homology. 

The formality for simply-connected compact [[Kähler manifold]]s implies that their real homotopy type is determined by their [[de Rham cohomology]] ring as shown using Hodge theory in the seminal work

This is later improved to rational homotopy type in

A major formality result is the [[Kontsevich formality]] (see references there) and the Tamarkin formality of the [[little disks operad]] which implies it. For both see [[Kontsevich formality]]. 

There are many recent cases of formality in geometry, topology and algebra
