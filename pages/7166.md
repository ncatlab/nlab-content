## Definition 

Given a [[monoidal category]] $M$, let $Coalg(M)$ denote the category of coalgebras (i.e., [[comonoid|comonoids]]) with respect to the [[tensor product]] of $M$. Let $U \colon Coalg(M) \to M$ be the [[forgetful functor]]. The **cofree coalgebra** refers to a functor _[[right adjoint|right]]_ [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to $U$, if it exists. 

## Examples

For example, a cofree coalgebra on a [[vector space]] $V$ consists of a coalgebra $C(V)$ and a [[linear map]] $\varepsilon \colon C(V) \to V$ which is [[universal construction|universal]] in the sense that given a coalgebra $C$ and linear map $f \colon C \to V$, there exists a unique coalgebra map $g \colon C \to C(V)$ such that $f = \varepsilon \circ g$. 

## Constructions 

From an abstract point of view, the forgetful functor $U \colon Coalg(M) \to M$ [[preserved colimit|preserves]] and [[reflected colimit|reflects]] (creates) any [[colimits]] which happen to exist, analogous to the fact that the forgetful functor $Alg(M) \to M$ preserves and reflects [[limits]]. Therefore, under hypotheses of an [[adjoint functor theorem]] (which almost always obtain in cases of practical interest), $U$ will indeed have a right adjoint. For example, this is the case when $M$ is the category of vector spaces over a field. 

It is of interest to have more explicit constructions available; we work this out for vector spaces.
