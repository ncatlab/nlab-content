## Idea

Stable homotopy groups are [[homotopy groups]] as seen in [[stable homotopy theory]].

A [[morphism]] inducing an [[isomorphism]] on all stable homotopy groups is called a [[stable weak homotopy equivalence]].

## Definition

### For pointed topological spaces

Given a [[pointed topological space]] $X$, then its _stable homotopy groups_ are the [[colimit]] of ordinary [[homotopy groups]] of its [[reduced suspensions]]

$$
  \pi_n^S(X) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k \pi_{n+k}(\Sigma^k X)
  \,.
$$

### For sequential spectra

Given a  [[sequential spectrum]] $E$, in the form of a sequence of component spaces $E_n$ with structure maps $\Sigma E_n \to E_{n+1}$, then for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ the $n$th _homotopy group_ of $E$ is the [[colimit]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \pi_n(E) 
    & \coloneqq 
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k
  \pi_{n+k}(E_k)
  \\
  & \coloneqq
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}
  \left(
    \cdots
      \to
    \pi_{n+k}(E_k)
       \stackrel{\Sigma}{\longrightarrow}
    \pi_{n+k+1}(\Sigma E_k)
       \stackrel{\pi_{n+k+1}(\sigma_k^E)}{\longrightarrow}
    \pi_{n+k+1}(E_{k+1})
       \to
    \cdots
  \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

over the [[homotopy groups]] of the component spaces. 

For sequential spectra in [[simplicial sets]], the same formula applies for the [[geometric realization]] of the component simplicial sets.


## Properties

### Suspension isomorphism

Let 

$$
  \Sigma
  \;\colon\;
  SeqSpec
  \longrightarrow
  SeqSpec
$$

be the operation of forming degreewise the [[smash product]] with the circle, the (un-derived, [[reduced suspension|reduced]]) [[suspension]] of $X$.

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[sequential spectrum]], smashing with $S^1$ constitutes [[natural isomorphisms]] of stable homotopy groups of $X$ with the stable homotopy groups in one degree higher of the suspension spectrum of $X$

$$ 
  S^1 \wedge (-)
    \;\colon\; 
  \pi_\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet+1}(\Sigma X)
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [Schwede 12, part I, prop. 2.6](#Schwede12))

### For suspension spectra

For $E = \Sigma^\infty X$ the [[suspension spectrum]] of a [[pointed topological space]], we have

$$
  \pi_n^S(X) \simeq \pi_n(\Sigma^\infty X)
  \,.
$$

### For Omega-spectra

For $E$ a (weak) [[Omega spectrum]] then the colimit is attained:

$$
  \pi_n(E)
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
      \pi_n(E_0) & for \; n \geq 0
      \\
      \pi_0(E_n) & for \;n \leq 0
    }
  \right.
$$

* [[free infinite loop space]]

* [[equivariant homotopy group]]


## Examples

* The homotopy groups of a [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^\infty X$ of a [[pointed topological space]] $X$ are the _[[stable homotopy groups]]_ of $X$.

* In particular the homotopy groups of the [[sphere spectrum]] are the _[[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_.

* [[Thom's theorem]] says that the homotopy groups of the [[Thom spectrum]] $M O$ form the (unoriented) [[cobordism ring]].
